1
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,250
No, no, not another loop.

2
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,370
That's just bait.

3
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,750
That's just bait.

4
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,390
It's not another loop.

5
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,850
Oh, you guys can sort of see what night I chose today.

6
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,690
I'm actually stuck between three nights, but I'll show you guys.

7
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:52,990
All right.

8
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,410
Sorry, I'm eating my Oreo cheesecake.

9
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,230
Get pee.

10
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,590
I went into errands today and went to the post office.

11
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:08,470
Also, I'm really tilted about the new laws about sending things to the United States of America.

12
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:15,970
So for those who live outside of America, fuck us to send shit to the States.

13
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,550
So now you guys sort of realize why?

14
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,870
Because I heard like, also fuck you guys too.

15
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,090
You guys got fucked as well.

16
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,490
Because you guys can't receive like a lot of stuff now outside of the States.

17
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,230
Because I heard that Japan Post suspended all shipment to America.

18
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,750
And now I know why it's so tedious.

19
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:47,030
Okay, so what I have to do is that there's a new law about tariffs.

20
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,750
And it's basically like how you can't...

21
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,650
There used to be a law where if it's under $800, you don't have to worry about getting tariffs and stuff.

22
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,730
Or like customs and everything.

23
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,730
So basically, the new law for Canadians to ship to America is we have to download a fucking...

24
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:39,150
app and we have to fill because like originally we have to fill a customs forum originally and and that's it like I just fill a custom forum I get the I get the QR code and then I hand it over to the post office now you have to also download a specialized app just to ship to America it's just it's dedicated to any American parcels,

25
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,930
any American package.

26
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,790
And, um, and I have to fill out, like, I have to, like, make an account.

27
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,170
And then I have to declare all the stuff I want to declare.

28
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,310
Um, I know, I was like, why does it have to be an app?

29
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,490
Why can't it just be on a website?

30
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,710
Like, it's so, it's so fucking annoying.

31
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,450
I'm like, why can't I just do this on the website?

32
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,170
So, but it has to be download a

33
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:32,670
it and then we have to fill out like the custom forms and because like we have to prepay if it's over a certain amount of money for customs we have to prepay the customs before we ship it out so but then i fill it all out and they're like oh you don't have to prepay anything anyway here's your id code because you have you can ship anything into the states if you don't do this app it's because like they actually turn you away because i didn't realize this because it was

34
00:06:36,910 --> 00:07:08,670
so i went to the post office because you know i shipped stuff to america because i was shipping some important things to the states um and um and uh i went over the post office like did you do the app and it was about to close because you know i love procrastinating and it was about to close and they're like oh did you do the app we have a new thing on the 29th now and then i was like oh what and they're like yeah you have to download this app oh but i don't know you have time to fill it up because we're closing in 10 minutes.

35
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,310
I was like, oh.

36
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,410
So I had to, and I couldn't do it.

37
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,430
And I'm like, sorry.

38
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,110
Maybe you can ship it like next tomorrow.

39
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,250
And then I waited until Monday.

40
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,590
And then I realized Monday is Labor Day.

41
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,890
And I was like, and I took all my packages on Monday.

42
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,350
And then the post office was closed.

43
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,530
And I had to come, and then I had to turn around.

44
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,230
And go back today.

45
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,990
So basically I went back today to the post office because I forgot yesterday was Labor Day because I don't pay attention to anything around me anymore.

46
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,610
If it's not about me, I don't care.

47
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,410
No, I'm joking.

48
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm joking.

49
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,490
Anyway.

50
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,030
So yeah, it was very annoying because we had to fill...

51
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:01,790
We basically have to fill out three separate forms now to ship anything to America because of like a terror situation.

52
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:45,550
But it's very inconvenient to me the fact if I didn't have to download an app it would have been fine the fact I didn't download a separate app like make it if you okay I'm just gonna say just streamline it like put it on the website just streamline it like what if I'm doing everything on a website I don't want to do everything on my fucking the worst part of doing anything on the phone is just the cop like don't I don't have my I don't have that ctrl C and ctrl V that's the most annoying part You know how annoying it is to highlight an address on your fucking phone and then like like then hold it and then control V and it could It's just so annoying.

53
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,310
I'd rather just use my mouse and control C and control V.

54
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:59,230
It's much more like it's much more easier Like it's my first world problem.

55
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,090
It really is.

56
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,290
No, it's just a highlighting part.

57
00:09:02,450 --> 00:10:02,930
It's so annoying something before you control c control v on the phone it's very inconvenient and what if i have numerous tabs it's like it's more annoying swapping between tabs on a phone than it is on them than it is on the pc um anyway so i had to do that and um and uh no wonder there was a store there was a store um the small business i for those who watch my members i was i was talking about this like small business that I really like that sell like handmade clay charms and then literally on the top of their website it's like we don't ship to US anymore I guess it's so inconvenient she was like this is too inconvenient like we don't ship to the US anymore now I know why I was like yeah I live in Canada.

58
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,530
Also, dad update.

59
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,310
Dad update.

60
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,830
Today, he was, I don't know.

61
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,570
Like, I guess every, okay, ever since he got, like, he's been very bratty lately.

62
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:30,850
He's been incredibly bratty because, I don't know, the more, the, the, like, you know, he's, like, beat death, like, twice.

63
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,990
You know, he...

64
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,010
He survived twice, so now he's like, nothing can stop me.

65
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:46,370
So, you know, okay, every morning I give him a little treat, and it's like those dental treats, the green bones thing, because I'm, like, really worried about his dental lately.

66
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,990
Because the vets have warned me about it.

67
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,610
Like, oh, there's a little bit of tar on his, like, on his teeth.

68
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:28,410
And I was, like, asking for advice, and my friends were like, oh, yeah, if you give him these, like, the greenies, um you don't have to worry about uh you don't have to like really worry about dental problems um so you know um it's more so of like you know it's like a little tree for him in the morning and now now he knows it's a routine so he's been like like if after I feed him and I was like okay sleep time and then he like wakes me up like two to three hours later and he stands next to the bag of greenies and he's like bitch where's my treat

69
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:54,810
where's my treat in the morning bitch like I demand my treat and I'm like what the this is like a this was like an extra bonus like and he's just like get out of the bed and give me that treat woman and it's just like you give What?

70
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,610
I just give it to him in the morning so he doesn't, so he won't have his fucking teeth pulled out.

71
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,250
Like, classy.

72
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:23,110
And then, like, today, um, yeah, today, when I was walking dad today, um, we were, there was a dog from across the street, and he was, the dog was just staring at him, like, staring at dad, and, like, dad did not like that.

73
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:41,250
Like the other dog from across the street was literally just sitting there staring at dad and then dad's we were just waiting for the Waiting at the crossroads for the light to turn green to walk or white I guess because like in Canada, it's white and not green for some reason and

74
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:57,210
So he was just like looking at him looking at my dog and my dog like dad noticed it and he like stared back But then dad got like super antsy and And he was like, he was like, he started barking.

75
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,950
He was like, what are you looking at?

76
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,370
What are you looking at?

77
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,630
Why are you looking at me like that, huh?

78
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,170
The other dog, he didn't fucking care.

79
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,870
He just kept looking at my dog.

80
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,590
Like, zero reaction.

81
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,490
It's zero reaction.

82
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,790
And then dad just kept barking at him from across the street because he just didn't like it.

83
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,350
He just didn't like how he just kept staring at him.

84
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,550
Like, are you staring at me, pun?

85
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,290
Yeah, that's fucking right.

86
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,490
And then the other dog just didn't care.

87
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,610
He was just standing there.

88
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,310
He was just sitting, like, not even standing.

89
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,310
He was just sitting there looking at my dog.

90
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,210
And, like, he had zero reaction when Dad just kept barking back.

91
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,630
Like,

92
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,580
I'm just chilling.

93
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,280
Um, yeah.

94
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,940

This will affect the new merch.

97

Nope, because...

98
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:17,780

It was very hard.

151
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,970
I didn't know which one to pick.

152
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,010
All right, we'll make a pull, though.

153
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:46,910
Pull.

154
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,050
Okay.

155
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,030
Skin.

156
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,990
Uh, grub.

157
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,710
Okay.

158
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,190
I can't even spell grub.

159
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,990
Grub.

160
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,810
And it's not even sun.

161
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,270
Or...

162
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,310
Rick.

163
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,550
Here we go.

164
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,010
Grub, son, or Rick?

165
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,010
Oh, Grub is what- I think it's the spin.

166
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,210
I think everyone just loves spinning.

167
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,710
Got a Grub's life.

168
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,210
You already know we want...

169
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:26,750
Spin!

170
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,110
Spin!

171
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,290
What does it look like for the dash, anyway?

172
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,110
Where the fuck am I?

173
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,870
I don't even know where I am.

174
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,950
Oh my god.

175
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,130
Who the fuck is shit?

176
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,990
Oh, it's the guy that stole me here.

177
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,170

178

All right.

180
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,910

181
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,210

00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,670

183
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,810
Bad touch.

184
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,850

185
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,310

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,510
Okay, we gotta go to the green path.

196
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,430
Yeah, we don't have the last power up because I didn't care.

197
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:30,810
Alright.

198
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,810

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,590

200
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,730
Alright.

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,550
Isn't the...

204
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,310
The last power up in the green path?

205
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:46,930
Oh.

206
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,390
The last one is close.

207
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,090
I don't even remember, to be fair.

208
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,230
I read the guide, but I wasn't really paying it.

209
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,610

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,830

247
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,530
Is it in Queen Station?

248
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,310
I don't want to pull up my guide right now.

251
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,450
Yeah, HP.

252
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,330
Just don't get hit.

253
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,190
You don't need HP if you just don't get hit.

254
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,890
Okay, down here.

255
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,830
Alright.

256
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,170
Okay, I don't need that yet.

257
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,990
Alright.

258
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,590
Where is it?

259
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,430
It's to our left, right?

260
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,690
Okay, it's to our far left.

261
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,090
All right, I gotta figure this out.

262
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:42,850
Wee.

263
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,630
Okay, far left.

264
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,770
So this way?

265
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,270
Wait, what's over here?

266
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,110
Oh, I never been here before.

267
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,430
Wait, what's over here?

268
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,650
Oh, shit!

269
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,470
All right, that's a lot.

270
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,430
Okay.

271
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,410
I didn't realize what's over there.

272
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:06,810
Uh...

273
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,310
Let me think a little.

274
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,810
bit.

275
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,050
Okay, I think, yeah, alright.

276
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,030
I don't know, they've been here before.

277
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,290
So I don't know what's over here.

278
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,310
Whoa.

279
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,430
Oh, I'm a little scared.

280
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,170
Not gonna lie, but... Whoa.

281
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,270
Okay.

282
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,570
Ow!

283
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,410
Oh, oh!

284
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,310
Okay, I was worried that I was gonna get hit by that.

285
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,530
Wee!

286
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:45,770
Ah!

287
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,410
I'm okay.

288
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:48,810
Wait, there was...

289
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,030
Wait, this was nothing.

290
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,130
Wait.

291
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:53,650
Ow.

292
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,510
Okay, wait, what's the point of being here?

293
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,620
Wait, what the fuck was...

294
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,020
What?

295
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,540
What's the point of being here?

296
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh, for this.

297
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,700
What's this?

298
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,440
I got a charm.

299
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Oh, yay!

300
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:12,960
Yippee!

301
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,580
I got a charm notch!

302
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,660
Okay, nice.

303
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

304
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,700
Okay, that's the point of...

305
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,020
Ah!

306
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm okay.

307
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm okay.

308
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,340
I'm a big, strong grub.

309
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,860
It's okay.

310
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,300
I'm a very strong grub.

311
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,480
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

312
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,940
I'm gonna grow up to be a big, strong grub too someday.

313
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,020
Okay.

314
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,280
This way.

315
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,840
Yippee!

316
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,620
Alright.

317
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm about to go next.

318
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,300
Okay, we just go forward.

319
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,580
I'll just swim in the acid.

320
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,160
It should be five.

321
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,740
And then I'll grab this.

322
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,160
Uh...

323
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,080
Who's this guy?

324
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,320
Trained.

325
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,500
Oh my god, who trained you?

326
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,680
Can I have their number?

327
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,840
Alright.

328
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,960
Tired.

329
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,530
All right.

330
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,350
Grab this.

331
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,620
All right.

332
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,940
Just...

333
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,080
Okay.

334
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,580
I'm gonna...

335
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:35,760
Okay.

336
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,100
I'm gonna...

337
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,460
Okay, I'm full HP.

338
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,420
I can't tell if I'm full HP.

339
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,540
It doesn't tell me when I'm lost HP.

340
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,920
Which is pretty bad.

341
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,520
It's pretty bad that this mod just tell me how much HP I have.

342
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm so cute, though.

343
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,660
Look at me swim.

344
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,360
Look at how cute I am.

345
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm swimming.

346
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Yes, we are a grub today.

347
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,720
My popular boat.

348
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,760
Oh, whoops.

349
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,280
It's fine.

350
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,280
Yeah, it's not buggy.

351
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,480
It's just that they didn't draw everything for the mine.

352
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,300
So, like, they didn't...

353
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,520
I guess they gave up.

354
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,200
It's not that...

355
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,460
necessarily buggy.

356
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,760
It's just that they just were like grubs don't hold maps.

357
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,520
It's against my grub lore.

358
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,660
It's here, right?

359
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,020
Oh, it's a bug, but...

360
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,980
Kill it.

361
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,200
Oh, wow, it feels like a nerf.

362
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,660
What do you mean?

363
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:25,320
You can't win the game at a grub and you ain't gaming i'm just gonna swim fuck this why parkour when i can just swim all right is it here is this where i get the power up oh yeah grub cat hit up either apparently grub can only hit left or right wait what is what is uh what's up top though Go up.

364
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,600
That's gonna say, what is on top?

365
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,200
Oh, is this where the power-up is?

366
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,680
Oh!

367
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,660
I'll grab.

368
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,780
I'll kill these guys just for the sake of it.

369
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,360
Alright, this is the power-up.

370
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,560
At least these guys are, like, super weak, which is nice.

371
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,570
Alright.

372
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,930
Oh, is it up?

373
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,190
Oh, it's up, isn't it?

374
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:06,610
Also, like, everything seems very doable, except for the part about the parkour for the true ending.

375
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,470
That's the only thing that I feel like I'm going to spend the most time on.

376
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:20,050
And apparently, I have to, I'm going to have to get, like, a regen or some shit.

377
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,850
Everything seems very, very doable, except for the parkour.

378
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:42,050
part oh wait i gotta cut this part off so i can get the shortcut shortcut oh there it is so i need to get like a regen thing to do the parkour

379
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:56,110
oh it's up okay okay i can't apparently grub doesn't know how to do that either

380
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:12,510
look I'm the grub is called is just calling for extra help okay it's called a friend and the friend is John Hollow Knight he's

381
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:30,920
just great he grub don't know Matt exactly grub don't know magic he has to call a friend grub can only walk exactly grub walk John Hollow Knight do rest

382
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,520
We'll do the rest what's over here though.

383
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
I don't know what's over here

384
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,030
Oh, is this queen?

385
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,010
Oh, it is it's the queen's garden.

386
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,390
I don't have map for this area though

387
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,280
Jesus, okay, this guy's annoying I have to kill him all right.

388
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,420
Yeah, it goes against grub lore

389
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Okay, at least he can't do that.

390
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,760
Am I full HP yet?

391
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,040
No Oh, I should get rid of him, too.

392
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,800
God, where the fucking egg?

393
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,720
Me egg.

394
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,280
I don't know what to do with the egg.

395
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,160
Okay, I gotta figure out where he...

396
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,540
Oh, hey.

397
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,020
Ah, tiny warrior.

398
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,480
Then you too came to test yourself against that traitorous tribe.

399
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,920
A deadly bunch, Dayara, that roost within these glades.

400
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,160
I will stay awake while clear them.

401
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,380
But your actions have shown me the truth of it.

402
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,100
face down our fears.

403
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,700
If we both make it through, we can swap stories of our adventure.

404
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,080
I look forward to that.

405
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:51,940
Yippee!

406
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,580
Yippee!

407
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,600
Yippee!

408
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Yippee!

409
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:54,800
Yippee!

410
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,520
Oh, shit.

411
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,980
Wait, can I not, like, use that as a... Can I poker this?

412
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,200
No, I can't.

413
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Okay.

414
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,300
No.

415
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,580
I'm yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

416
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,660
Gotta eat my grub.

417
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,660
Just silly grub.

418
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,100
Raves went upgraded and It's extremely powerful.

419
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,780
We don't get all hits with Shaman Stone.

420
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,100
It does 120 damage.

421
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,020
So Shade Stone does 40 normally.

422
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,880
Oh, that's a lot.

423
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,020
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

424
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,340
Thank you.

425
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:24,960
Thank you.

426
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay, we gotta figure out where the map guy is.

427
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,520
I thought that was meta.

428
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,340
Okay, that is Queen's Garden.

429
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,100
Well, maybe we'll fight.

430
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,360
I don't know.

431
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Fuck it.

432
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,140
Let's just go this way then.

433
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,240
Let's just keep going.

434
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,020
I was gonna upgrade my thing first.

435
00:34:44,040 --> 00:35:15,880

436
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,560
Where the fuck is the stack station though?

437
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm yum yum yum yum yum.

438
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,680
I'm so hungry.

439
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,720
I gotta eat my greens.

440
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,430
I don't know where the stack station is.

441
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,290
There's no maps.

442
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,290
Ow!

443
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,730
That's not cool.

444
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,090
But how come they can do the whirlwind this?

445
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,410
Oh, it's a trap.

446
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,870
It's a trap.

447
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,170
Oh, it's a trap.

448
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,790
It's a trap.

449
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:49,850
Okay.

450
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,350
God damn, I'm trying to eat my veggies!

451
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,710
My mama told me to eat my veggies!

452
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:56,890
Get out!

453
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,910
I'm yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam, yam.

Oh, there you go.

456
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,690
Okay, he's here.

457
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,500
They said they were traders, but how are they a trader?

458
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,840
Is there anything here?

459
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,220
Where the fuck is the...

460
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,340
Where's the map guy?

461
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,320
The map trip... Oh, there he is.

462
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,620
Are you serious?

463
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,360

472
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,120

Okay, where is this open?

How the fuck did I open?

483
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,800
Wait, what did I open?

00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,520
Guys?

485
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,520
What did I open?

486
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,700
Plans hungry for grub.

487
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh, door.

488
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,020
Oh, this door?

489
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,420
Was this door closed?

490
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,260
Oh, I wish I had a map to know.

491
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Oh, whoops.

492
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,080
It's fine.

493
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,320
Om yum, yum, yum.

494
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,420
Grub have grass.

495
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,620
Grub, okay.

496
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,060
Oh, no.

497
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,020
Grub not okay.

498
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,580
Grub not okay.

499
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,180
Oh, no.

500
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,920
Okay, Grub turned to John.

501
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,980
Oh,

502
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,660
this is actually pretty bad for Grub.

503
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,400
Okay, nice.

504
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,380
Grub, yum, yum, yum, yum.

505
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Grub, okay now.

506
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,860
Oh, nice.

507
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,640
Wait, they respond.

508
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,280
That's actually really good for me.

509
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,560
John, help!

510
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,140
No!

511
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,940
Okay.

512
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,360
Okay, I'll just farm these guys because they respawn anyway.

513
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,780
There we go.

514
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,320
Om yum yum.

515
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,740
What world hates, grub.

516
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,680
Okay.

517
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,840
We'll just farm these guys.

518
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,500
No, grub won't die in this room, guys.

519
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,940
Grub is fine.

520
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,440
Om yum yum yum.

521
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,260
Alright, poor is enough.

522
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,260
Save the grub.

523
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,640
on all the night.

524
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,920
You're her only hope.

525
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,100
Okay.

526
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,660
Nice.

527
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,040
Okay, nice.

528
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,920
Okay, okay, that's pretty strong.

529
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,740
Okay, it's fine.

530
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,900
I took him down with me.

531
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,100
Oh my god, that's so annoying, though.

532
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,360
All right.

533
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,920
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

534
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,740
Eat your veggies.

535
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,500
And you'll become a big, strong grub.

536
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,100
Jesus, that is so annoying, the whirlwind shit.

537
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,380
Like, ah, because I can't encounter it.

538
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,680
Because he throws it right at my face.

539
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,320
Oh, fuck.

540
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,160
I didn't know where it was.

541
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,540
I was like, where the fuck is that spike?

542
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,620
Are you serious?

543
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
Fuck off!

544
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,580
Ah!

545
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,160
Grub don't feel good.

546
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,280
Oh my god.

547
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,760
Why are you chasing me?

548
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,820
Oh my god.

549
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,180
Crook don't want to do this again.

550
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,120
I'll go all the way back.

551
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,340
I don't want to do that parkour thing again.

552
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,800
Because I'm going to be lost.

553
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,240
I know I'll be lost so I don't want to go back.

554
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,900
Run, little Crook.

555
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,580
Run.

556
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm going to be lost to try and find this place again.

557
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,680
So I'd rather just go back.

558
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:36,270
Alright.

559
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,210
That should be enough.

560
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,030
Just need to do...

561
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,890
Alright, here we go.

562
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,190
That should be enough now.

563
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,130
I wonder if the Mantis responds.

564
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:53,610
Are you serious?

565
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:54,250
No!

566
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,750
Okay, it's fine.

567
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,270
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

568
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:58,990
It's fine.

569
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,530
I have lettuce.

570
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,410
Okay, they don't.

571
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:04,950
Yay.

572
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,690
Okay, they don't respawn.

573
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,230
That's good.

574
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,660
Yippee!

575
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,780
They don't respawn!

576
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,960
Okay, that's good.

577
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,860
That is just one.

578
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,640
Are you serious?

579
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,340
Oh, I fucked that up again.

580
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,940
Okay, that's fine.

581
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,700
I didn't realize that's...

582
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,500
There's only one.

583
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,800
Okay, bench two does.

584
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,340
left.

585
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,940
Oh, I guess that's where the stack station is.

586
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,360
Well, Karen, I know that breaks when you get hit.

587
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,760
Yeah, we're not doing that.

588
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,960
We're just getting a true ending.

589
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Oh.

590
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,140
Oh!

591
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:45,680
Fuck.

592
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,760
What?

593
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,520
It came back!

594
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,460
Okay, that's bullshit.

595
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,880
Is it here?

596
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,300
Oh, it's a bench.

597
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:57,660
Okay.

598
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,300
I rather grab the bench then.

599
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,100
Bench time.

600
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:03,760
Yay!

601
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,560
Oh, I get to listen to music.

602
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,580
All right, let me turn and fix this real quick.

603
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,980
All right, I'm going to put this over here.

604
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,160
And then put my dream thing over here.

605
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
And I'll close this.

606
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,340
Yay!

607
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,920
Grow up, listen to music.

608
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,640
Um, go up, sleep.

609
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,520
Alright.

610
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,860
Here we go.

611
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,880
Oh, yeah, they respawned because I...

612
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,700
Oh, my... Okay.

613
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:47,820
That's good.

614
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,620
I gotta remember to double kill them.

615
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,420
Yay, I glowed now!

616
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,020
What the fuck?

617
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,400
Okay.

618
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,800
These, like, flying ones, like, don't really too much.

619
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,610
Okay, we go this way.

620
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,210
Oh, shit.

621
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,150
I guess not.

622
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,230
Where do we go?

623
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:19,790
Oh, nice.

624
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,710
There's money here.

625
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:23,910

Oh, is he a mask maker?

632
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,590
I won't think they have a face.

633
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,610
Nothing with which we are all are blessed.

634
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,470
Does it know of the face that hides beneath?

635
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,890
Such remarkable contrast that I am conceived.

636
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:25,610

645
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,410
The worms' great shame steal the way.

646
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,310
Now this kingdom's status becomes the worms.

00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,910

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,320
I sort of know the pattern.

689
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,380
Just make him throw the boomerang first before I go.

690
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,100
Oh shit!

691
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,580
I don't expect to see these guys.

692
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,200
Okay, nice.

693
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,870
Okay, get rid of him first.

694
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,190
Oh!

695
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,370
I would tell my father about you!

696
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,790
That wasn't nice!

697
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,590
All right, where's the stag station?

698
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,170
This way, this way.

699
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,240
Stag station should be nearby.

700
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,800
Okay, that's money.

701
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,280
I want to be a rich world.

702
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,380
Unless you forgot, and I probably misspoke.

703
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,160
Oh, shit!

704
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,740
Clab, zoop, bretta, and leg eater.

705
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,640
Wait, it's this way.

706
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,100
Oops.

707
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,560
Okay, up.

708
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,820
Stag station up top.

709
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,900
Wait, is it that door?

710
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,880
Where's that station?

711
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,160
I follow map.

712
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,340
Up here?

713
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,020
Maybe?

714
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,120
Oh, it's here.

715
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,180
Oh, this does not look like stack station.

716
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,320
I missed it?

717
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah, I was gonna say, this does not look like it.

718
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,700
Oh, up and around.

719
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,280
Stag station, doco?

720
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,220
Is it here?

721
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,080
Is it here?

722
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,520
What is this?

723
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,160
Here sleeps the traitor's child.

724
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:51,700
Dream!

725
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,200
Oh.

726
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:53,700
What?

727
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,490
The traitor's child.

728
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,310
Oh.

729
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,130
I have no idea.

730
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,570
Oh, shit.

731
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,070
I have no idea what that is.

732
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,850
Oh, oh my god.

733
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,210
Pac-Core.

734
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,650
Oh, I jumped!

735
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,570
Oh, yay, speed ride.

736
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,750
I'm yam-yam-yam-yam-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y.

737
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:21,190
Okay.

738
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,130
Oh, it's a side quest.

739
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,010
Okay, because I was like, what the fuck is that?

740
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,630
That wasn't part of the true ending guide.

741
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,910
Okay, so I have to go up and then down.

742
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:33,290
Right?

743
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,770
would lead me to.

744
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,250
God, these guys are annoying.

745
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:43,710
Holy fuck.

746
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,050
Okay, I don't care about them enough.

747
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,030
These guys are very annoying.

748
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,290
I think it's more so like, I don't know where they're...

749
00:52:58,290 --> 00:52:59,030
Like, I don't...

750
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,670
Like, I don't know their pattern.

751
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:01,870
They have no pattern.

752
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:02,790
They just jump.

753
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,910
That's their pattern.

754
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,090
They just want to jump.

755
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,690
Oh!

756
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,510
That's all they do Oh my god

757
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,720
They're just jumping

758
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:40,400
Oh my god They're so annoying They're actually so annoying Holy fuck It's just the worst part is that they don't have a pattern to their jumps

759
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:58,430

I have one more leaf.

767
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,840
My dad packed a leaf in the backpack for emergencies.

768
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,060
Are you serious?

769
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,920

It was this way.

774
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:35,790
That's fine.

775
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:37,650

777
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,990
The fact that they respawn as well is so bullshit.

778
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,870
I'm just gonna pass you.

779
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:46,470
Goodbye.

780
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,450

Was it up?

786
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,430
Wait, yeah, it was up.

787
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,050
Yeah, because I was like, where the fuck is the stack station?

788
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,090
And then it was this way.

789
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,070
The randomly jumping bugs.

790
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,790
It's just so bullshit!

791
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:25,790
Oh!

792
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:26,490
Oh!

793
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,990
The fact that they respawned, dude, fuck he sucks.

794
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:34,910
I'm just gonna run past him.

795
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:35,430
Fuck this.

796
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:36,410
Oh my god.

797
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,190
Fuck this.

798
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,030
Oh my god.

799
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:38,870
It doesn't matter.

800
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,930
Oh my god.

801
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,670
It doesn't matter.

802
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:42,630

803
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

804
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,310
You do not kill me.

805

Okay.

806
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:50,410
Okay.

807
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,630
My own soul was trying to kill me.

808
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,130
Get back in here.

809
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:55,530
Okay.

810
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:58,650
All right.

811
00:56:58,770 --> 00:56:59,410
Here we go.

812
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,670
We gotta figure this out.

813
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,170
Oh, yeah.

814
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,950
Okay, I see the...

815
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:11,890
Oh, God.

816
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:13,630
Oh, God.

817
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,670
Okay, we got rid of him.

818
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,150

819
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,030
Yeah, no, fucking.

821
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,270
Yeah, I know.

822
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,930
I can tell why it kills speedruns.

823
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,090
Yeah, no, these guys are absolutely bullshit.

824
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,370
Oh my god, I have no idea where I'm at.

825
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:44,950

01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,980
Okay, also, I realized I forgot to grab the upgrade.

951
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,100

01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,300

Wait, what?

974
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,200
How do I activate it?

975
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,620
Oh!

976
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,820
Don't worry, my babysitter can do it for me.

977
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,320
John Hollow Knight, my babysitter activated it.

978
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,380

979
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,240

Happy.

982
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:11,510
Okay.

983
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,410
Okay, now I just gotta scream.

984
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,170
See, I told you guys.

985
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,350
I told you guys everything would be okay.

986
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:25,030
The donkey wave.

987
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,560
Alright.

988
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,920
Now I can go back up.

989
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,780
Just gotta remember how to do it.

990
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:42,530
I think that's the hardest part.

991
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,810
It's so far up.

992
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,850
I noticed that there was something to- oh shit.

993
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:47,150
Whoops.

994
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,870
I noticed there was something to my left earlier.

995
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:51,910
Is that important?

996
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,830
Remember that it is on my left side?

997
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,330
It's a side quest?

998
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:06,910
Yeah, there it is.

999
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:07,530
Oh wait, no.

1000
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,250
Not here.

1001
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,620
Is it here?

1002
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:15,200
No?

1003
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,140
Oh shit.

1004
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,220
Yeah, okay.

1005
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,500
Yippee!

1006
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,100
Grub no need to think!

1007
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,920
I gotta figure out where to go.

1008
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,880
This way.

1009
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,940
Oh shit, what the fuck?

1010
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,780
What the fuck?

1011
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,000
Okay, my jumping thing was being weird there.

1012
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,260
For some reason.

1013
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,400
Oh yay, money!

1014
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:49,260
Random money!

1015
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,480
Oh!

1016
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,240
More random money!

1017
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,810
Yeah.

1018
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:02,490
Where do I go?

1019
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,730
This way.

1020
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,450
This way?

1021
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,990
This way?

1022
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,070
Oh my gosh, I'm so... Oh, there it is!

1023
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:15,370
Yay!

1024
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:19,810
Okay.

1025
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,230
Now we go home.

1026
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,130
Now we fight the volleyball!

1027
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:29,590
Okay, the volleyball has a lot of HP.

1028
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:32,010
I was not expecting that.

1029
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,060
Alright, now we can fight him.

1030
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,260
Can't catch me.

1031
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,460
No bad touch.

1032
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:46,960
Alright.

1033
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,540
Alright, now we go back.

1034
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,660
How great is my nail?

1035
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,580
I think it's plus two.

1036
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:02,510

1042
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,740
Okay, that was a lot easier with the upgraded shriek.

1043
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,060
Oh, stranger, you're strong!

1044
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,560
Much stronger than me.

1045
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,720
I've been waiting a long time, stranger.

1046
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,940
I've been finding a long time, stranger.

1047
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm very, very tired.

1048
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,940
The queen will be here soon, and I just need to sleep a little.

Bro was consumed.

We're gonna figure out... Okay, it should be the top, I guess.

1055
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,460
Assume it's the top part.

1056
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,800
You will be forgot.

1057
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,080

I was looking at chat.

1060
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,820
Like Grubhub.

1061
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,180
That's right.

1062
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,020
Get Grubhub.

1063
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,160
Top right.

1064
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,260
Yeah.

1065
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,860
I assume it's the one area I have yet to explore.

1066
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,800
Yeah, this way.

1067
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,600
Like up top here.

1068
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,060
There you go.

1069
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,220
Oh.

1070
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,440
Okay, I might as well grab Close Souls, too.

1071
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,800
While we're at it.

1072
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,300
Okay.

1073
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,550
Alright, I have no idea where I am.

1074
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,150
That's the best part.

1075
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:25,520
Oh.

1076
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,880
Usually, like, it doesn't hit me on the first level.

1077
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:30,880
I'll just heal this.

1078
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,560
Made that look easy.

1079
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,840
Because it was easy.

1080
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:35,700
Oh, my God.

1081
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,540
Oh, my God.

1082
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,080

01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:42,220
I hate these guys so much.

1085
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,440
Oh, I hate them.

1086
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,500
Oh, my God.

1087
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,420
There you go.

1088
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,560
I don't know.

1089
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,240
I don't know if it's up, but I'm gonna go up anyway.

1090
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,140
Just tank that.

1091
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,240
For extra.

1092
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,360
Oh.

1093
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,440
I mean, yeah?

1094
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,260
Oh, shit.

1095
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:17,840
What?

1096
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,010
Okay.

1097
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:22,970
I had a feeling.

1098
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,410
Ah, god damn it.

1099
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:30,830
I had a feeling it's Pogo.

1100
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,790
Oh, that's bullshit.

1101
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:36,490
Okay.

1102
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,640
Oh, my God.

1103
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:44,820
No.

1104
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,420
I was trying to stop it.

1105
01:17:59,160 --> 01:17:59,680
Okay.

1106
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,220
Grub leave.

1107
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:02,120
Oh,

1108
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,920
I'm back at the green path.

1109
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,420
I mean, I might as well grab this while I'm here.

1110
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,200
Okay.

1111
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,090
Oh.

1112
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,050
I can't do that.

1113
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,090
Grub leave indeed.

1114
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:28,190
Well, I can't do anything here.

1115
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:36,730
Oh, is bad because i think down here are like more mantises i'm pretty sure

01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:19,840

1118
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:28,080
This is actually training for the hard part of the parkour.

1119
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,060
Okay.

1120
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:38,480
Really?

1121
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,440
He's gonna go down?

1122
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,760
Why is he slowly heading towards me?

1123
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,420
Fucking freak.

1124
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,120
There you go.

1125
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:03,740
Yeah, this one is a little annoying.

1126
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,080
Oh, fuck, I didn't see that.

1127
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,620
God damn, I didn't see that.

1128
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,640
I did not really.

1129
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,480
Oh, my, oh, fuck.

1130
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,200
What?

1131
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,640
I got comboed in the sky.

1132
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:22,540
Where am I?

1133
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,300
Oh, I'm here.

1134
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:24,900
I'm here.

1135
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,140
Wait, where do I go?

1136
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,340
Is this the one?

1137
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,460
I did not see that.

1138
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,630
God damn it.

1139
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:39,350
I'm literally, this is actually practice right now for me.

1140
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,110
This parkour practice.

1141
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,730
Grub life.

1142
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:48,790
I got wobble comboed.

1143
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,660
Is Thorne actually fucking with me?

1144
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,240
I can't, or the long nail.

1145
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,330
I can't tell.

1146
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,820
Wait, Lover?

1147
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,360
Wait, what does it do?

1148
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,580
Why is it bucking with me?

1149
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,300
Okay, this way.

1150
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,220
Oh, my god.

1151
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:30,920
There you go.

1152
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,660
That should do that.

1153
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,540
Oh, my word!

1154
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:39,690
Alright.

1155
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,570
I hate the whirlwind shit.

1156
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,710
That one shit actually is so annoying.

1157
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,860
Okay, let's get the full HP first.

1158
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:00,880
Get it over here.

1159
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,320
I don't have thorns on.

1160
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,660
Oh shit, sorry.

1161
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:07,860

01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:10,520
I don't have thorns on.

1163
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:11,860
I don't think I do.

1164
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,340
I think I took- I'm pretty sure I took it off, right?

1165
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,380
Yeah, I took it off.

1166
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,740

1173
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,620
I guess I die.

1174
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:14,820
I guess...

1175
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,120
I guess I'll die, I think.

1176
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,740
I mean, I think.

1177
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,100
I mean, I could...

1178
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,100
I could just fall down a little.

1179
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,660
I'll fall down a little.

1180
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:30,600
Oh.

1181
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,220

1184
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,950
This is my parkour of hell practice.

1185
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,740
No texting or driving.

1186
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1187
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,800
I don't...

1188
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,260
Why is it like that?

1189
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:36,440
Okay.

1190
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,600
I don't know why it does that sometimes.

1191
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,120
It doesn't, like...

1192
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,960
Like, you guys can see that?

1193
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,000
Like...

1194
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,060
Oh, come on.

1195
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:49,700
Come on!

1196
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,960
That's so bullshit!

1197
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,540
Does that work?

1198
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:00,720
No.

1199
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,420
Ah, down!

1200
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,080
No!

1201
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:10,020
Okay.

1202
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:10,700
Don't worry.

1203
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,340
Maybe we'll grab some extra HP.

1204
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,080
I hate this.

1205
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,220
Parkour is so hard.

1206
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,060
Parkour is so hard.

1207
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,620
Why is Parkour is so hard.

1208
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,640
Why can't parkour be easier?

1209
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,360
We don't understand.

1210
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:44,040
Wait.

1211
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,380
If only...

1212
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,220
Okay, I don't think I should be here.

1213
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:52,620
This is static!

1214
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,860
Alright, here you go.

1215
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,520
It's okay.

1216
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,140
We will...

1217
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:12,060
If we master this parkour part, we can master the harder parkour part.

1218
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,360
It's this way.

1219
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:19,640
Oh, you don't understand.

1220
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:24,040
If we master this, that means we can take on any parkour level.

1221
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,360
Like, this is a truth parkour test.

1222
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,600
Oh my god, what the fuck happened to me?

1223
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,760
It's okay, we still, we didn't die.

1224
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:46,500
It literally hit the edge there.

1225
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,580
That's how, oh my god, that's how I was saying, we didn't die.

1226
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:57,940
Guess I missed another lover.

1227
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,940
It's okay, guys.

1228
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:04,860
We don't need the lever.

1229
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,080
We don't need it.

1230
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,140
Oh, shit.

1231
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,000
Where did I die?

1232
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:12,940
Oh, it was this way.

1233
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,980
Okay, I gotta remember where my soul is.

1234
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,960
Okay, I gotta find my soul.

1235
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:26,820
Get over here.

1236
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,040
I gotta pick up my babysitter.

1237
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,360
Dude, like, the jump is not...

1238
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,740
No, it's very difficult.

1239
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:39,220
It's not allowed to give me that super chat.

1240
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,480
You don't understand.

1241
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,180
I was not made to parkour.

1242
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,920
Like, right now.

1243
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,680
I was not made to parkour.

1244
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,340
I've never seen this guy before.

1245
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,240
Like, outside.

1246
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:09,460
Okay.

1247
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,040
I've never seen him all the way up here before.

1248
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,820
Usually he's like, usually he's like not there.

1249
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,240
Just don't get hit.

1250
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:22,480
Don't worry, we got it.

1251
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:30,440
Don't worry.

1252
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,180
He's knocked.

1253
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,300
Fly up.

1254
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,200
Fly up.

1255
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:34,360
Up.

1256
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,760
Not down.

1257
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,260
Fly up.

1258
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:37,880
That's right.

1259
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,060
Keep flying up.

1260
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:40,480
There we go.

1261
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:44,920
There we go.

1262
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:47,800
Oh, this is a little too close.

1263
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,080
Okay.

1264
01:28:58,920 --> 01:28:59,340
Okay.

1265
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:01,900
Oh.

1266
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,260
How do I cancel?

1267
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:05,700
I wish I could just cancel this right now.

1268
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,960
God damn it!

1269
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,680
I hate that you can't cancel it.

1270
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:13,760
I did.

1271
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,720
Fly up!

1272
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,360
Fly up!

1273
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,900
Go higher!

1274
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,100
Oh my god.

1275
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,360
It won't.

1276
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,280
Oh my god.

1277
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,060
Of course it's a double.

1278
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,880
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1279
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,580

Oh, fuck it.

1317
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,160
I don't think I can live this.

1318
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,000
I...

1319
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,300
I have one HP.

1320
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,680
I'm surprised it's a boss fight.

1321
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,560
Yeah, I literally have one HP.

1322
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,920
I do not think I was gonna live that.

1323
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,500
No, one HP and a dream.

1324
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,980
Random fucking boss fight out of nowhere.

1325
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,000
Okay, now that I know...

1326
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,600
No, it's still possible I can get the true ending, guys.

1327
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,320
I believe.

1328
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,460
It's this way.

1329
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,140
Because you did it.

1330
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:33,780
believe.

1331
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:37,940
Okay, now that I know there's a boss fight, I'll lock in.

1332
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,300
And this way.

1333
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:53,390
Alright.

1334
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:54,030

1335
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:55,050
Easy.

1336
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,170
Oh, hey, I missed the lever.

1337
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:01,970
Yay!

1338
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,110
Will I ever get that lever?

1339
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,950
Maybe one day.

1340
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:13,470
Okay.

1341
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:16,450
Unless they go back from the mini guys, too.

1342
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:17,830
Yeah, it does.

1343
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:18,650
Okay, so.

1344
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,050
Okay, now that I know.

1345
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:25,050
Alright, that's fine.

1346
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,510
Yeah, I want to make...

1347
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:30,270
Nice.

1348
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:33,030
Okay, one more small guy.

1349
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:34,570
Oh!

1350
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:36,290
Oh, yippee!

1351
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:36,770
Yippee!

1352
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,950
Oh, shit!

1353
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:41,490
What the fuck?

1354
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:42,770
Oh, I forgot it doesn't do knock.

1355
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:43,930
back these guys.

1356
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,230
Okay, now that I know.

1357
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:50,670
Okay, now I know it doesn't do knockback.

1358
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:54,050
I didn't even have time to learn his moves.

1359
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:55,370
Okay.

1360
01:35:02,190 --> 01:35:02,730
All right.

1361
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:08,130
Okay.

1362
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,700
Oh my god, he put me in the corner.

1363
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,670
There was nothing I could do there.

1364
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:18,260
Oh!

1365
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,120
He's dabbed.

1366
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,040
God damn it.

1367
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,200
Wait, what?

1368
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:26,560
Oh, shit.

1369
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,840
Okay.

1370
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,260
I don't know if I can heal, though.

1371
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,100
I don't know if I can heal.

1372
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:36,190
I actually need her to distract him.

1373
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:37,760
Nice.

1374
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:39,540
Oh, he does double!

1375
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,200
That does double the damage!

1376
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,240
Oh!

1377
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:44,400
Oh!

1378
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,180
Oh, that does double damage.

1379
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,400
Okay, I can actually...

1380
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,780
Let me arrange my charms now.

1381
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,260
Okay, I don't need this.

1382
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,480
Okay, now that I know that does double damage.

1383
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,840
Okay, he does too.

1384
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,280
Okay, now that I know.

1385
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,460
Okay, I need...

1386
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,320
Okay, I got rid of...

1387
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,580
Why should I get locked?

1388
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,060
I feel like long nails good.

1389
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:07,820
Uh...

1390
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,200
Mark of Pride?

1391
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,320
What was that?

1392
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,040
I don't remember.

1393
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:14,900

1394
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:15,440

Okay, the range.

01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,300

01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,060
I found it.

1411
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:31,840
Oh my god, it was right there the entire time.

1412
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:32,920
Wait, where was...

1413
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:33,360
Where is it?

1414
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,720
Oh, it goes that way.

1415
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:35,780
Okay.

1416
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:38,760
Yeah, I'm not overcharming.

1417
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:39,960
There's no fucking way.

1418
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:45,260
Yeah.

1419
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,230
Oh, shit.

1420
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,850
Oh, fuck.

1421
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:54,170
I was like...

1422
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,330
Okay, I'm sorry.

1423
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:02,410
Okay, I might have been fucking around there.

1424
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:04,530
I rushed that.

1425
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:07,190
Whoops.

1426
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:13,090
Tee-hee.

1427
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:16,330
Just being a little silly.

1428
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:20,730
I'm just being a little silly, you guys.

1429
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:22,670
Tee-hee.

1430
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:24,510
Tee-hee.

1431
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,450
Okay, there we go.

1432
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:34,670
Alright.

1433
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,560
Nice.

1434
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,940
And then this guy just dies instantly.

1435
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,060
Oh, what the fuck?

1436
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,640
He just spawns on my head.

1437
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,900
I'm just like...

1438
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:58,620
He's just gonna...

1439
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:02,400
I was not expecting that.

1440
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,040
I don't know.

1441
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:11,300
I just I thought he wouldn't be on my fucking head.

1442
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:13,960
Okay.

1443
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,560
I want to use...

1444
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,360
Are you serious?

1445
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:17,600
Oh my god.

1446
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,300
A fucking course.

1447
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,240
He dashes away.

1448
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,440
Okay, there you go.

1449
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:28,360
Oh my god.

1450
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:30,600
I think that's the worst part about that move.

1451
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,520
It's just the fact that I can't see him.

1452
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,120
Oh my god.

1453
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:39,920
What?!

1454
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,360
I can't see him!

1455
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:49,340
It's good damage, but I can't see him when I use it.

1456
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,080
Yeah, he hits so hard.

1457
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,260
I hate that he does two damage.

1458
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:00,840
Yeah.

1459
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:04,720
Alright.

1460
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:07,400
Oh my.

1461
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:08,940
This boss is difficult.

1462
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,620
I think if he didn't...

1463
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:15,100
If he didn't do two damage, it would have been so much easier for me.

1464
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,400
I'm not used to bosses doing two damage.

1465
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,060
Oh no, I do not have TP.

1466
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:40,110
Yeah, I'm not used to the dive spell.

1467
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,310
I keep fucking it up.

1468
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:43,970
Every time.

1469
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:44,730
I don't know why.

1470
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:47,710
I just can't get that move to work properly.

1471
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:50,510
I make a try.

1472
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:51,630
I'll try for this one.

1473
01:40:57,370 --> 01:40:58,990
Oh my god, are you serious?

1474
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:00,210
Yeah, I tried.

1475
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:03,150
Okay, there you go.

1476
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:05,910
I felt like that was a waste, though.

1477
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:10,350
I'm just gonna heal.

1478
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:20,360
Okay.

1479
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,600
Whoa.

1480
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,080
What?

1481
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,340
Okay, okay, why are they all?

1482
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,620
Why are they all above me?

1483
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,200
What the fuck?

1484
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,860
You'd say all just showed up above me.

1485
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:41,600
Oh, my.

1486
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:46,740
Okay.

1487
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:52,300
Nice.

1488
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,640
Oh, my God.

1489
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:55,920
The shadow thing didn't work.

1490
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:57,380
That sucks.

1491
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,620
Are you serious?

1492
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,080
Whoa!

1493
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,740
Okay.

1494
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,120
Okay.

1495
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,880
I'm gonna play more careful here.

1496
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:23,490
I dashed too far.

1497
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,430
Oh it was on cooldown.

1498
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:28,290
I didn't realize it was on cooldown.

1499
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,720
Oh my god.

1500
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,600
I dashed too.

1501
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,980
I was too far away from my dash.

1502
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:40,660
This one has to be my current hardest.

1503
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,740
Or maybe I'm just not locking in.

1504
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,440
I don't know.

1505
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,480
I don't know bro.

1506
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:48,220
I think this is the hardest for me only because it does two damage.

1507
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:51,520
Yeah.

1508
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,280
Only because he does two damage.

1509
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,240
Lost King did like one.

1510
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,100
So like, it wasn't like...

1511
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:02,660
I wasn't too worried about it.

1512
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,280
When he does two, it like...

1513
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,240
Fucks with me more.

1514
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,480
Because it makes me more...

1515
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,480
It makes me more like...

1516
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,460
Anxious, I guess.

1517
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:25,380
I didn't, I don't know that's the right word, but like It just makes me more anxious

1518
01:43:29,730 --> 01:43:31,170
Because I have less

1519
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:37,170
Because I don't have that much HP

1520
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,080
Yeah, yeah, there's no openings to heal, I agree

1521
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:51,270
I agree, there's barely any chance to heal at all

1522
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,210
Alright, I'm locking in, I'm locking in this.

1523
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,770
I'll try.

1524
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:06,770
I'm gonna I'm I'm

1525
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,340
Yeah.

1526
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:24,740
Are you just not so far?

1527
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,460
The range for that was so far!

1528
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,740
I wasn't ready for that.

1529
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,160
Oh my god.

1530
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,320
I fucked up.

1531
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,020
I fucked up there.

1532
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,740
Okay, okay, I'm locking in fully.

1533
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,760
Yeah, his range for that was so far.

1534
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,180
Okay, I'm fully locking in.

1535
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:03,300
I understand his patterns.

1536
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,240
I just need to figure out the range of his dashes.

1537
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:12,500
His dash range, I messed up on calculating.

1538
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:16,260
I miscalculated the dash.

1539
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:18,300
Okay.

1540
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,760
Come on little grub.

1541
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:41,420
You can do this You're just a small grub in a big bug world But I believe in you Also that reminds me because oh fuck He loves to go at Pixar You know they're making Coco 2 And I saw a Twitter comment and they're like What the fuck are you gonna do in Coco 2?

1542
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:51,360
The grandma fucking died I'm just like wait he's so true Like what I was like, wait, he's right.

1543
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,880
The grandma's dead.

1544
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,600
Why the fuck is there going to be a Coco too?

1545
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:56,900
Like, yeah.

1546
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:04,060
The spoiler, it is toky.

1547
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,300
Alright.

1548
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,140
I was like, wait, he right.

1549
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,100
Are you...

1550
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,340
Okay, that's bullshit.

1551
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,280
That's bullshit.

1552
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,520
I should have been able to kill that guy here.

1553
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,240
Let's wait for Big Baba.

1554
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,000
Yippee!

1555
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:29,340
Yippee!

1556
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:29,680
Yippee!

1557
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:30,320
Big Mama!

1558
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:39,560
Oh my god.

1559
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:47,410
I'm just gonna let her kill him.

1560
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:48,810
I'm just gonna...

1561
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:49,250
Yay!

1562
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,770
Yum yum yum yum yum!

1563
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:04,630
Yeah, maybe I'll I'll do the pogo.

1564
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:10,720
Oh my god.

1565
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,880
Yeah, I'm not going to do that move.

1566
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,820
That move is way too risky.

1567
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,520
Are you serious?

1568
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:24,900
I thought he was jumping.

1569
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,020
That was my worst run.

1570
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,640
That was my worst run.

1571
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:31,520
I thought he was going to jump.

1572
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,760
That was a bad prediction.

1573
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:34,940
Holy shit.

1574
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,380
This fucking stupid Lord Mantis.

1575
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:50,350
Fucking You know, that means he's a virgin Because he's still alive Let me think about it The woman hasn't eaten his head yet

1576
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,080
Not rock

1577
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:12,280
Toki Oh shit, sorry Is that, isn't that one the male mantis?

1578
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:16,900
I thought it wasn't, this one was the male one.

1579
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:20,700
I refuse to believe that.

1580
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,500
How is he alive?

1581
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,420
His head should have been eaten.

1582
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,700
Oh my god.

1583
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,520
Yeah, I thought he was male.

1584
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,020
How is he alive?

1585
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,440
Then he's a fucking cat.

1586
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,080
He's still alive.

1587
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,760
He's a fucking coward.

1588
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:45,780
No honor.

1589
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:46,880
He is.

1590
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:47,460
That's why.

1591
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,220
That's why he's a traitor.

1592
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:54,360
Because he didn't get himself get himself eaten.

1593
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,360
That's why he's a traitor.

1594
01:48:58,880 --> 01:48:59,800
He ran away.

1595
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:00,760
No honor.

1596
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:01,480
No.

1597
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:08,240
No fucking honor.

1598
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,440
He didn't get himself.

1599
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,760
himself eaten.

1600
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:27,550
Okay, because all the other male mantises did it?

1601
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:35,370
He's a coway.

1602
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:40,130
He's a fucking coway.

1603
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:45,150
It's not worth it, bro.

1604
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:53,560
It's so tight.

1605
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:56,980
The...

1606
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:57,760
The dash.

1607
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:01,880
Oh my god.

1608
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:02,540
I was trying to pogo.

1609
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:03,300
It didn't work.

1610
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:05,940
Are you serious?

1611
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:10,560
Hey!

1612
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,080
Okay, I actually got focused up, though.

1613
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,080
Are you serious?

1614
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,920
Oh my god, that's so bullshit!

1615
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:23,610
Okay.

1616
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:26,910
Oh my god.

1617
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:27,910
That's just so bullshit.

1618
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:29,790
It is- he's so fast.

1619
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:34,370
He does double damage for a reason.

1620
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:41,140
Okay.

1621
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,740
He's so fast.

1622
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,200
I think this is my strongest filter.

1623
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,800
I don't need the dream gate.

1624
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:53,540
I don't even know what that is.

1625
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,420
I'm getting rage baited.

1626
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:58,000
I am.

1627
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,920
I'm getting rage baited, but I'm not.

1628
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,300
a guy that ran away.

1629
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:03,260
No honor.

1630
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,200
Get your head eaten like all the other male mantises.

1631
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:10,200
Actual no honor here.

1632
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,500
Look, I'm just a little baby.

1633
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,580
Look at me!

1634
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:27,900
I'm literally just a child!

1635
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,640
Why is he picking a fight with a child?

1636
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:42,720

01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:20,540
The run's already dead.

1641
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,560
Oh, the run is already dead.

1642
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:23,940
Oh, my God.

1643
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:24,660
The run...

1644
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:25,200
I'm just...

1645
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:26,200

1647
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:27,900

We're gonna do the 1 HP run.

1652
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,540
It's like an extra challenge.

1653
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:48,680
I just feel You know what, fuck it

1654
01:52:55,040 --> 01:53:04,810

1657
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,810
Oh, my God.

01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:46,570
Out of all of the...

1664

Out of all of them.

1665
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:48,550
Just because of the two damage.

1666
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,990
The two damage is, like...

01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,170

You can tell the females here didn't feel like it.

01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:48,000
If they ran away, you know damn well.

1673
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:52,500
You know damn well they were supposed to get eaten.

A true battle of mighty warriors.

So intense.

1693
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,240
So climatic.

1708
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:31,860
Or does a path carry it by chance to so pertinent a place?

1709
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:33,400
It is true.

1710
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:35,420
True that you were awaited.

1711
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:36,780
No, perhaps.

1712
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,600
That is inaccurate.

1713
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,660
True wing like you was awaited.

1714
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:42,800
I have a gift.

1715
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:45,020
How long for one of your kind.

1716
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:49,860
Half of a whole, when united, great power is granted.

1717
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:53,760
And on the path ahead, great power it will need.

1718
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:57,040
Yippee!

1719
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,680
Free stuff!

1720
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,220
Yay!

1721
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:00,640
Yippee!

1722
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:01,220
Yippee!

1723
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:04,800
Wait, that's my mama?

1724
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:06,680
Where were you?

1725
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:10,880
My dad had to raise me on his own.

1726
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,820
I had 40 plus brothers!

1727
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,540
Where were you, mom?

1728
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:18,860
It faced a gendered child.

1729
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,460
She was a fierce foe.

1730
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,700
Strong in mind and body.

1731
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:24,680
Shaking reflection of her mother.

1732
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:57,620
minute little time together i never begrudged the worm stallion says bargain in fact i feel some affection for the creature some affection you're my mom of your paths forever to lie i imagine you might gain yourself a pal what the fuck do you mean some affection yeah mom moment within my roots the weakening of the vessel i plainly feel i mean too obvious i have there are from such a thing.

1733
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:00,680
The first is inevitable on a current course.

1734
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:03,600
Regression on mine relinquished their play.

1735
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:07,860
The second I find preferable and will seek your aid in its occurrence replacement.

1736
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:10,080
I implore you, you swept the vessel.

1737
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:11,760
I suppose its train was ill-judged.

1738
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:15,920
It was tarnished by a dealer and stilled, but you, you're free of such blemishes.

1739
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:18,180
You could contain that thing inside.

1740
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:19,020
Dream!

1741
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,160
So you can access a mine.

1742
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:23,580
The seal shall break before its blade.

1743
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:26,040
Oh, she was talking about the hornet.

1744
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,280
Oh.

1745
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,540
Can't believe my mama hates me.

1746
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,380
I don't have mommy issues, I swear.

1747
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,200
Oh, gender child is the hornet.

1748
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,800
Oh, because she's the only one with, like, a gender.

1749
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:49,100
No, Toki.

1750
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,240
She was gonna go to Bahá'u'llah.

1751
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,120
Why, Toki?

1752
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:54,900
Why?

1753
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:15,660

1754
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:28,300
so all i'm saying is that i'm the better option go up what is your up here?

1755
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,240
I understand.

1756
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,280
What do you mean by up?

1757
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:38,320
Alright.

1758
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:39,900
Where am I?

1759
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:40,920
Oh, I don't have my map.

1760
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:41,440
I forgot.

1761
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,560
Yel and Pogo this one?

1762
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:46,260
Up here?

1763
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:47,760
How do I do that?

1764
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:52,260
Ow.

1765
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:55,400
There?

1766
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:57,720
How mad just of you.

1767
02:02:58,220 --> 02:02:58,860
From that?

1768
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:08,240
That better be something up there.

1769
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,280
I swear they're God.

1770
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,980
Oh, there's nothing there.

1771
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:19,980
Oh, my God.

1772
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:20,880
I fucking knew it.

1773
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:22,340
I knew that I was bait.

1774
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:24,680
I fucking knew it.

1775
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,780
I fucking knew that was bait.

1776
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:30,620
I got one guy.

1777
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:34,160
Me when Doki gets one guy.

1778
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:37,900
Where do I go now?

1779
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:41,040
Guys, where do I go?

1780
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,700
Oh, yeah.

1781
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,720

We're okay.

1787
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:26,730
We're okay.

1788
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:30,950
Everything is fine.

1789
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:34,910
Okay, we're not going to deal with these guys because I feel like I'll die.

1790
02:04:38,450 --> 02:04:39,010
There you go.

1791
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:40,130
I'm y'all, y'all, y'all.

1792
02:04:41,650 --> 02:04:42,310
I'm going.

1793
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:46,130
Come to say happy September to you and all the other dragoons.

1794
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:47,550
I know nothing about Hall Life.

1795
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:49,590
I want to wish you the best on the battles ahead.

1796
02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:52,470
Trevor for the Aka Aka Supa!

1797
02:04:53,290 --> 02:04:53,970
Thank you!

1798
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:55,370
I really appreciate it!

1799
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:56,550
Thank you so much!

1800
02:04:56,710 --> 02:04:58,850
And now we have a great day too, Trevor.

1801
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:00,130
Alright.

1802
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:03,890
Staggedness.

1803
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:05,170
Which is Staggedness?

1804
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:11,110
What the fuck is Staggedness?

1805
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:19,690
Yeah?

1806
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:23,810
Yeah?

1807
02:05:27,790 --> 02:05:29,230
Oh, I forgot to equip the compass.

1808
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:30,550
Wait, what's this?

1809
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,050
What the fuck?

1810
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:34,050
Okay, give me a sec.

1811
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:35,230
Let me...

1812
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:36,370
Alright, I'm gonna go to...

1813
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:37,510
Let me sit down first.

1814
02:05:40,350 --> 02:05:41,170
I didn't even know...

1815
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:43,070
Yeah, I didn't even notice I unlocked it.

1816
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:48,070
Alright, let me grab my compass before we do this.

1817
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:54,490
Okay, compass, and then...

1818
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:55,330
I'll grab this.

1819
02:05:57,130 --> 02:05:57,950
All right.

1820
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:01,850
Okay, Stag's nest.

1821
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:10,330
All right.

1822
02:06:10,930 --> 02:06:11,310
His home?

1823
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,190
His home is pretty sad.

1824
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:16,770
Oh, they're all dead!

1825
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:21,130
Oh, that's so sad.

1826
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:25,830
All his friends died of old age.

1827
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:29,370
Oh, nice.

1828
02:06:29,450 --> 02:06:30,350
Sippy, more souls.

1829
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:38,250
All my friends are dead.

1830
02:06:38,690 --> 02:06:40,730
They all died at that old age.

1831
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:42,530
You're like lonely George.

1832
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:44,650
The past you hold.

1833
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:47,290
Is it not for that ghastly machine to tram?

1834
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:50,950
I hope you're not thinking right on that gross tech contraption.

1835
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:54,210
The thought of a mere machine could tempt what we stags do.

1836
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:55,230
Foolish.

1837
02:06:55,610 --> 02:06:56,670
Very foolish.

1838
02:06:58,390 --> 02:06:58,990
Okay.

1839
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:02,930
a secret?

1840
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:04,550
Over here?

1841
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,000
Why do I go up top?

1842
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:14,100
What?

1843
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:16,540
Oh?

1844
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:19,700
Oh, there you go.

1845
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:23,140
Huh.

1846
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:27,970
Oh.

1847
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:30,510
What's the secret?

1848
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:36,080
He's gonna get me.

1849
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:37,020
He's gonna get me.

1850
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:37,880
I'm gonna get you.

1851
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:38,800
I'm gonna get you.

1852
02:07:41,560 --> 02:08:12,760
Oh where am I where did I go oh oh I'm supposed to go left oh I missed it I went too far where did I go I was like where am I hey well Come home!

1853
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:13,600
Yay!

1854
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:15,080
I'm home!

1855
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:20,760
Okay, back to the Stag's Nest.

1856
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:25,480
It was all a dream.

1857
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,020
I was like, where did I go?

1858
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:30,500
Being back in my own home.

1859
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:33,320
Feel the way of my long life bearing down on me.

1860
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:35,040
I'll carry it proudly, though.

1861
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:38,820
Whenever I travel, the memories of my family might come with me.

1862
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,500
I skipped a dream fight.

1863
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:48,140
Alright.

1864
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:50,900
Going back.

1865
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:54,340
Wee!

1866
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,660
Oh, do I go here?

1867
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,660
Oh, it's here!

1868
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:02,960
What's over here?

1869
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:05,740
An empty eggshell.

1870
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:10,800
Wait, a stag is born here.

1871
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,400
Where'd I go?

1872
02:09:20,850 --> 02:09:22,810
Yeah, that means there's one side.

1873
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:24,990
Oh, that's him!

1874
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:27,390
Oh!

1875
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:29,490
Wait, are these all eggs?

1876
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:31,670
Wait, they're all eggs here!

1877
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:33,630
Wait, his family's all here!

1878
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:34,890
His family...

1879
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:36,410
Look, there's more babies!

1880
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:42,290
Oh, it's a new one?

1881
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:46,770
Wait, that means, like, he's not alone now!

1882
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:49,370
You're not alone, Grandpa.

1883
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:52,970
What do you think of my old home, little one?

1884
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:54,930
It was full of life once.

1885
02:09:55,090 --> 02:10:00,770
Sags coming and going, swapping stories of places they've been and the passengers they met.

1886
02:10:01,370 --> 02:10:07,630
For a long time now, I considered myself the only one remaining, the last snag.

1887
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:10,690
But being the nest again, there's something in the air.

1888
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:12,710
A smell or warmth?

1889
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:15,550
Or perhaps a presence, perhaps?

1890
02:10:16,890 --> 02:10:19,910
Other stags have made her way out into the wild world?

1891
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:22,170
Yes, I'll hold on to that hope.

1892
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:27,190
My kin, still alive, still out there, journeying beyond these lands.

1893
02:10:27,530 --> 02:10:33,490
But for me, I could never abandon the stagways, not as long as Paggisters still need them.

1894
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:36,710
Um, it's Passenger, it's only me.

1895
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:39,830
I could tell you some important work to do.

1896
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:43,770
I will be your companion as long as my old body still serves.

1897
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:46,770
Let's enjoy the old stagways of this kingdom to you.

1898
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:48,710
together a little longer.

1899
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:49,770
Yay!

1900
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:52,490
I'm his one and only customer.

1901
02:10:53,110 --> 02:10:54,570
Yippee, yippee, yippee!

1902
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:57,630
Wait, his name change, right?

1903
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:00,310
It's old stag.

1904
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:03,010
Just give me a... Oh yeah, it did!

1905
02:11:03,150 --> 02:11:04,590
He's now old stag.

1906
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:08,330
He's a boomer.

1907
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:09,310
Alright.

1908
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:12,890
Or I believe...

1909
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:18,850
I believe there's a guy here for it, right?

1910
02:11:21,450 --> 02:11:23,130
Okay, we updated the map.

1911
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:25,790
How did he kill us?

1912
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:26,890
Or what?

1913
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:29,790
Okay, but I want to attack one, kill one.

1914
02:11:29,950 --> 02:11:31,590
Okay, where's the other dream guy?

1915
02:11:33,610 --> 02:11:35,410
Where can I kill a dream man?

1916
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:36,790
Is it here?

1917
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:40,190
Oh my god, stop!

1918
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:45,470
Yeah, where is the flawless net?

1919
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:51,740
Where is it?

1920
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:52,620
Is it this way?

1921
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:54,000
From the nest?

1922
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:54,840
Where's the nest?

1923
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:58,680
I don't even remember where he lives.

1924
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:02,760
I know there's a knight here.

1925
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:03,620
Left?

1926
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:05,520
Oh, first boss room.

1927
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:05,860
Okay.

1928
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:09,780
Alright, we'll go there.

1929
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:14,240
Okay, there is like one area I've been went to.

1930
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:15,280
Where is this area?

1931
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:18,260
I haven't been here before.

1932
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:19,460
Apparently.

1933
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:56,650

02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:58,330
A fucking course.

1935
02:12:58,490 --> 02:12:59,590
It's always a trap!

1936
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:08,600
Okay.

1937
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,820
Just pooping babies.

1938
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:15,640
Are you serious?

1939
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:16,840
You hit up.

1940
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:23,760
Oh my god, I hate you.

1941
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:25,740
That's right.

1942
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:30,440
Of course you spawn into me.

1943
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:33,700
Oh, your babies!

1944
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,020
Your fucking babies!

1945
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:36,800
Nice.

1946
02:13:40,540 --> 02:13:43,420
Why is there a heart beating below me?

1947
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:45,320
Whose heart is that?

1948
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:48,660
Oh, it's your heart.

1949
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:50,340
Yoink.

1950
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:51,980
Loing womb.

1951
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:54,360
Can I dream you?

1952
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:57,380

1953
02:14:05,810 --> 02:14:07,810
God, Soda, man.

1954
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:14,110
What's that?

1955
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:16,050
I'm just a little baby.

1956
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,120
Oh, wait.

1957
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:23,140

02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:24,140
Oh, gross.

1959
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:25,800
I'm in his juices.

1960
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,320
I'm in our fucking juices.

1961
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:30,440
That's gross.

1962
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:33,700

1967
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:54,660
What is the womb?

1968
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:55,720
Glowing womb.

1969
02:14:57,620 --> 02:14:57,880

1970
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,800
Drains the soul of his bearer and uses it to birth hatchlings?

1971
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:08,860
The hatchlings have no desire to eat or live and will sacrifice.

02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:52,560
Wait, is that him?

02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,400
That's just a little sad.

1988
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:48,960
Not gonna lie.

1989
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,740
Is this where he lives?

1990
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:54,800
Where does he live?

1991
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:56,140
Oh, here.

1992
02:16:57,900 --> 02:16:58,240
Right?

1993
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,060
Yeah.

1994
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:03,060
I legitimately forgot his movesets.

1995
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:04,520
It's been so long, guys.

1996
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:09,040
I don't know how to kill him.

1997
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:10,820
It's been so...

1998
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:13,740
I don't think I'm first trying this just because I forgot what he does.

1999
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:17,500
I...

2000
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:18,980
Oh my god.

2001
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:24,580
Oh, yeah, no, I'm fucked.

2002
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:26,920
No, this is fucked up.

2003
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:29,980
Oh.

2004
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:34,220
Hey, I'm back.

2005
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:38,240
Wait, I'm gonna watch if he can kill himself.

2006
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:39,460
Come on.

2007
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:40,960
That's right.

2008
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,260
Oh, his head's too big.

2009
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,960
That's so sad.

2010
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:46,940
Wake up.

2011
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:48,660
Oh, that's so sad.

2012
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:50,300
His head's too big.

2013
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:57,260
Oh, he also deals double...

2014
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:58,400
God, fucking...

2015
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,160
They all do double damage.

2016
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:02,980
A fucking Qursi also...

2017
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:03,480
Oh, whoops.

02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:04,750

2019
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:07,720
I'm back!

2020
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:08,640
Hello!

2021
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:10,220
I woke up from my coma.

2022
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:12,940
Okay.

2023
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:15,880
You don't sound too sad about it.

2024
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:19,220
Oh, I know that.

2025
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:22,940
Yeah, because I'm like, why does it go that way?

2026
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:54,340
i'm so confused like what's over here oh it's just a long oh it's the longer way to get there yeah because i look like why is that why does that go up i see it's just a longer way to do get there okay okay That's annoying, actually.

2027
02:18:56,040 --> 02:18:57,660
Okay, that also does damage, too.

2028
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:58,940
That does damage on him.

2029
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:00,000
Okay.

2030
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,700
Oh, this guy's hard.

2031
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:05,480
Wait.

2032
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:09,000
This guy's hard.

2033
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:10,740
Yeah.

2034
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:13,960
I see now.

2035
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:14,360
Okay.

2036
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:16,480
Wait, actually, give me your shit.

2037
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:20,540
I need some of my souls.

2038
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:21,940
Okay.

2039
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:25,500
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2040
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,380
All right.

2041
02:19:36,890 --> 02:19:39,430
I'm trying to figure his pattern out.

2042
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:42,070
I don't remember if I could, like, walk up to him or not.

2043
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:46,490
Oh.

2044
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:53,780
Oh, my God.

2045
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:54,280
He's serious.

2046
02:19:59,460 --> 02:20:00,420
Oh, why?

2047
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:06,800
Oh, I am awake again.

2048
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:09,300
Do I have a bench nearby?

2049
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:09,980
Oh, I do.

2050
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:12,580
Do I need a...

2051
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:12,900
You know what?

2052
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:13,480
Yeah, fuck it.

2053
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:15,420
I'm gonna grab...

2054
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:17,300
I'm gonna grab a bench.

2055
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:19,140
Alright.

2056
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:21,900
I'm gonna grab a bench real quick.

2057
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:22,580
I'll be back.

2058
02:20:24,060 --> 02:20:24,240
Ooh.

2059
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:29,740
More bench.

2060
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:30,600
Here?

2061
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,700
Wait, did they block my bench?

2062
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:38,500
No, right?

2063
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,680
Okay.

2064
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:43,960
Wait, did these blobs block?

2065
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:46,220
Oh, they blocked it.

2066
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,820
Oh, goddamn stupid blobs.

2067
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:51,020
Stupid fucking infection.

2068
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:51,980
God stupid.

2069
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:53,220
God damn it.

2070
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:57,520
Man.

2071
02:20:59,080 --> 02:20:59,920
I'm so mad.

2072
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:01,620
It's their bench now.

2073
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:04,740
You can jump away when they...

2074
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:10,020
Alright, I'm gonna grab...

2075
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:12,580
Okay.

2076
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:13,840
Okay, there we go.

2077
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:15,540
Alright.

2078
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:17,200
Dream!

2079
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:22,960
Alright, I don't want to...

2080
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:24,720
I don't want to go all the way to the stag.

2081
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:30,760
I'll figure this out.

2082
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:32,200
Okay.

2083
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,600
Oh my god.

2084
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:38,660
This is annoying, actually.

2085
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:42,400
That's actually so annoying.

2086
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:43,660
Holy shit.

2087
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:45,880
Holy shit!

2088
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:50,620
Oh my god!

2089
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:54,380
That's so annoying!

2090
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:57,780
I need to figure out his attack pattern.

2091
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:03,620
They're farming guys.

2092
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:06,360
Farm you of essence.

2093
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:11,560
I can dash through his attacks.

2094
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:14,120
Yeah, but it's still pretty annoying though.

2095
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,300
All right.

2096
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:27,690
I think it's also because of the fucking curse.

2097
02:22:29,070 --> 02:22:30,570
Yeah, the room environment.

2098
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:32,190
It's like the kin thing again.

2099
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:35,850
It's the room environment.

2100
02:22:37,090 --> 02:22:38,490
I think if I didn't have...

2101
02:22:38,490 --> 02:22:41,730
I think if I didn't have to deal with the room, yeah.

2102
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:47,130
If I didn't have to deal with the fucking rocks as well.

2103
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:48,310
Okay.

2104
02:22:52,470 --> 02:23:01,230
Holy shit It's like an actual like Skill jump between Between like the bosses

2105
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:16,030
Alright Okay I'm gonna try and just do a range Are you serious?

2106
02:23:17,230 --> 02:23:18,230

02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:33,860

2108
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:37,400
Oh my god, he's comboing me!

2109
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:45,220
Oh yeah, I was like, I didn't think I could do it from here.

2110
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:47,420
Holy shit.

2111
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:50,780
Okay, I'm gonna try and figure out his combos and what to do.

2112
02:23:58,420 --> 02:23:59,780
I think it's just that.

2113
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:02,940
Oh my god.

2114
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:07,480
I'm trying to figure out a playstyle for it.

2115
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:09,040
Like...

2116
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:16,620
I'm trying to figure out a place down for this cat.

2117
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:20,940
Holy shit.

2118
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:24,300

02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:25,460
I'm like whack-a-mole.

2120
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:29,490
He's just whack-a-moleing me.

2121
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:32,400
Okay.

2122
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:35,320
When he jumps...

2123
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:37,320
Okay, I don't know his...

2124
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,840
His jumping attack yet.

2125
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:40,560
I'm trying to figure out his pattern.

2126
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:43,040
Okay, I get it.

2127
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:44,640
I don't get it.

2128
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:51,160
I don't get it.

2129
02:24:59,510 --> 02:25:00,030
Okay.

2130
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,640
I get it.

2131
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:06,900
Okay, I get it now.

2132
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:08,220
Oh, I get it.

2133
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:08,740
I get it.

2134
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:09,440
I get it.

2135
02:25:09,460 --> 02:25:10,400
I figured it out.

2136
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,400
I'm figuring it out.

2137
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:13,160
That's it.

2138
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:16,320

I did it.

2145
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:28,640
I figured it out.

2146
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:31,640
I downloaded.

2147
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:34,560
That's right.

2148
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,080
Your brother ain't here no more.

2149
02:25:37,940 --> 02:25:39,360
He left you alone.

2150
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:42,020

2151
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:45,600

I can't kill you here in the dream.

2252

Thank god he's not the hardest dream boss.

02:36:42,350 --> 02:36:43,950
I think it's just the environment.

2282
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:45,950
The environment fucks me up the most.

2283
02:36:46,170 --> 02:36:47,010
I'm pretty sure.

2284
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:52,000

2298
02:37:49,860 --> 02:37:50,480
Thank you.

2299
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:52,140
That's good.

2300
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:52,900
Okay.

2301
02:37:56,860 --> 02:37:57,340
Alright.

2302
02:38:01,170 --> 02:38:01,650
Alright.

2303
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:09,030
Oh my god.

2304
02:38:12,530 --> 02:38:14,590
I just realized it doesn't like...

2305
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:19,030
Are you serious?

2306
02:38:19,270 --> 02:38:20,410
Okay, that's fine.

2307
02:38:24,810 --> 02:38:25,210
Oh, nice!

2308
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:26,430
Okay, I figured it out.

2309
02:38:30,490 --> 02:38:31,670
Okay, I figured it out.

2310
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:32,870
Okay, I figured out the pattern.

2311
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:34,470
Okay, whoops.

2312
02:38:35,570 --> 02:38:37,710
He has a second buff!

2313
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:40,610
Never mind.

2314
02:38:42,190 --> 02:38:43,110
Never mind.

2315
02:38:44,050 --> 02:38:46,690
I was like, what's that move?

2316
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:48,670
What was that move?

2317
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:50,290
Okay, now I know.

2318
02:38:50,570 --> 02:38:51,250
Now I know what to do.

2319
02:38:51,710 --> 02:38:52,490
I'll just dash through.

2320
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:55,150
Alright.

2321
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:56,190
Yeah.

2322
02:38:57,610 --> 02:38:59,310
I was like, yay!

2323
02:38:59,850 --> 02:39:01,990
I was like, wait, I've never seen that before.

2324
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:09,180
Alright.

2325
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:13,160
Oh.

2326
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:14,260
That sucks.

2327
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:16,060
I didn't think you would do that first.

2328
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,440
Are you serious?

2329
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:22,420
Oh, I'm restarting this.

2330
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:23,460
I'm restarting it.

2331
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:24,560
I'm restarting it.

2332
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:26,280
Yeah.

2333
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:29,400
Okay.

2334
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:30,840
I know.

2335
02:39:31,940 --> 02:39:32,660
Heal and stagger.

2336
02:39:32,820 --> 02:39:34,400
Yeah, I'll heal and stagger next time.

2337
02:39:38,100 --> 02:39:39,320
It's so far.

2338
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:40,680
I can't change it.

2339
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:41,620
It's so far.

2340
02:39:42,220 --> 02:39:43,440
No, you don't understand.

2341
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:45,280
I'm too lazy to go back.

2342
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:50,540
Now, I'm just stubborn now.

2343
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:52,660
You don't understand.

2344
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:56,220
I'm stubborn as hell.

2345
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:08,840
Oh my god, the rock got me!

2346
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:15,740
Okay.

2347
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:24,180
All right.

2348
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:26,240
Okay, he does this.

2349
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:29,460
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2350
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,140
Are you serious?

2351
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:37,740
Oh, it's because I already dashed.

2352
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,620
Oh, I don't have time to do the thing now.

2353
02:40:45,260 --> 02:40:48,960
Oh, oh, I just was like, wait, why can't I dash through it?

2354
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:50,260
It's because of my cooldown.

2355
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:53,740
Okay, I get it.

2356
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:56,100
I realized my cooldown ran out.

2357
02:40:57,460 --> 02:41:00,340
I was like, wait, I can't dash through him anymore.

2358
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:02,860
Can't confirm.

2359
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:04,140
I smiled at him when he all came.

2360
02:41:04,580 --> 02:41:05,860
But it made me happy, included it.

2361
02:41:05,860 --> 02:41:07,180
Wait, what do you mean?

2362
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:08,740
The child is good.

2363
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:09,820
It was good chocolate.

2364
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:11,180
It was good.

2365
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:14,560
Takeda, thank you for magenta, so far.

2366
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:15,580
Thank you, thank you.

2367
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:17,160
I'm glad it didn't get on the print.

2368
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:18,140
That makes me happy.

2369
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:18,980
Yippee, yippee.

2370
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:19,960
Didn't get on the print.

2371
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:20,900
Yippee, yippee.

2372
02:41:25,580 --> 02:41:27,480
I would have been worried if it did.

2373
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:28,800
I hope it didn't get anywhere else.

2374
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:31,140
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have included chocolate.

2375
02:41:31,300 --> 02:41:32,280
I should have included candy.

2376
02:41:32,780 --> 02:41:33,920
I didn't think about that.

2377
02:41:33,980 --> 02:41:35,800
Because I like, my place is air conditioned.

2378
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:38,080
so I never thought about things melting.

2379
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:43,440
I'm just a little stupid there.

2380
02:41:45,380 --> 02:41:46,220
Oh my god.

2381
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:50,120
Oh, I'm, I'm like, I'm stumbling now.

2382
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:55,920
Oh, okay.

2383
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:57,060
I might reset this run.

2384
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:01,060
I'm like, messing up when I shouldn't be.

2385
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,840
Oh, god damn it.

2386
02:42:12,060 --> 02:42:13,140
I thought he was gonna jump.

2387
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:18,520
I got distracted because I was happy everything is going arriving safely

2388
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:44,700
all right all right there you I'm slowly downloading holy shit the dream bosses are are it's like the thing about it is like it feels like uh what's

2389
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:54,200
It's definitely like a huge skill jump from what it was before.

2390
02:43:07,020 --> 02:43:10,000
Yeah, from what it...

2391
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:16,340
From the normal bosses to the dream bosses is like a huge skill jump.

2392
02:43:17,100 --> 02:43:18,200
The difficulty spike.

2393
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:23,720
Okay.

2394
02:43:27,140 --> 02:43:45,300
all right okay i'm gonna try and lock in now for these runs because it's taking too long and i'm angry three in a row jesus he's fucking greedy

2395
02:43:51,320 --> 02:44:04,520
oh my god there's so many rocks oh my god he just uses these attacks that's so oh it's just all these attacks

2396
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:24,860
the fact that it was just these attacks too

2397
02:44:34,490 --> 02:44:47,330
oh my god not the rocks oh my god i didn't have dash oh Oh my god.

2398
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:51,990
The damn rocks.

2399
02:44:54,650 --> 02:44:55,210
I have double.

2400
02:44:55,270 --> 02:44:56,190
What the fuck I'm playing Dream?

2401
02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:57,350
Of course I have double jump.

2402
02:45:01,350 --> 02:45:03,290
Oh, you can nail him down.

2403
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:05,490
You can nail him when he's staggered.

2404
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:07,030
I just...

2405
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:09,670
I can't do a double jump when he's too close.

2406
02:45:10,610 --> 02:45:11,570
Because like...

2407
02:45:12,170 --> 02:45:12,650
Um...

2408
02:45:13,490 --> 02:45:15,870
Like, see, I can't time that.

2409
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:18,910
For those who are like, oh, just double jump it.

2410
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:25,150
Jesus Christ.

2411
02:45:25,870 --> 02:45:27,170
I might have to do a rerun for this.

2412
02:45:29,910 --> 02:45:31,250
Forgetting the cooldown.

2413
02:45:35,830 --> 02:45:39,030
No, this guy's harder because the environment is harder.

2414
02:45:39,910 --> 02:45:43,030
He does double hit and, like, the rocks are harder.

2415
02:45:44,290 --> 02:45:44,850
Okay.

2416
02:45:49,530 --> 02:45:50,010
Alright.

2417
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:01,500
I had...

2418
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:02,220
Uh...

2419
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:05,800
You can dash away and then double jump faster than you think, but that depends on the reaction.

2420
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:10,160
Yeah, I could do that, but...

2421
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:14,820
I'll do this for now.

2422
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:15,800
Okay.

2423
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:19,920
Oh my god.

2424
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:22,780
Okay.

2425
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:25,000
Nice.

2426
02:46:30,590 --> 02:46:31,190
Okay, I'll eat.

2427
02:46:32,250 --> 02:46:33,910
Wait, I thought you said doesn't stack.

2428
02:46:34,250 --> 02:46:34,770
Wait, what?

2429
02:46:34,890 --> 02:46:36,150
He got back up.

2430
02:46:37,970 --> 02:46:38,870
Wait, what?

2431
02:46:42,050 --> 02:46:43,630
He got back up.

2432
02:46:50,340 --> 02:46:52,440
You guys said he wouldn't get back up.

2433
02:46:52,540 --> 02:46:53,260
You guys lied.

2434
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:54,500
Wait.

2435
02:46:58,100 --> 02:46:58,700
Oh.

2436
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:08,100
I

2437
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:18,150
read Nell and I instinctively used Nell.

2438
02:47:22,700 --> 02:47:23,380
Oopsie.

2439
02:47:25,180 --> 02:47:25,980
Oopsie.

2440
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:33,080
Someone said Nell and I used Nell.

2441
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:34,100
Oh.

2442
02:47:43,560 --> 02:47:46,140
Oh no!

2443
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:48,680
Oh no!

2444
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:49,640
I've written it!

2445
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:51,040
And then I went...

2446
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:51,880
No?

2447
02:47:58,350 --> 02:47:58,550
Oh!

2448
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:02,430
Oh no!

2449
02:48:03,510 --> 02:48:05,170
Oh no!

2450
02:48:05,170 --> 02:48:05,490
Oh no!

2451
02:48:05,490 --> 02:48:07,150
I've written it!

2452
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:11,850
Oh no!

2453
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:15,830
Oh no!

2454
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:18,010
No, it's so much harder now.

2455
02:48:23,930 --> 02:48:24,810
Ah!

2456
02:48:27,510 --> 02:48:28,390
Okay.

2457
02:48:29,770 --> 02:48:33,030
I guess I'll go grab and swap my charms.

2458
02:48:35,170 --> 02:48:38,570
I guess I'll swap my charms now.

2459
02:48:39,350 --> 02:48:40,350
Okay, what?

2460
02:48:41,990 --> 02:48:43,510
I fucked up.

2461
02:48:47,490 --> 02:48:48,530
I'm sad.

2462
02:48:50,030 --> 02:48:51,290
I'm so sad.

2463
02:48:53,330 --> 02:48:55,810
What do I swap to anyone?

2464
02:48:56,230 --> 02:48:57,710
I gotta remember how to get there.

2465
02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:04,870
Not my fault.

2466
02:49:05,170 --> 02:49:06,030
I read now.

2467
02:49:07,250 --> 02:49:08,370
Wait, so how do I...

2468
02:49:09,210 --> 02:49:10,930
Wait, but like, he does...

2469
02:49:12,930 --> 02:49:17,530
Okay, I'll get rid of this long nail swarm.

2470
02:49:18,490 --> 02:49:19,610
And then we'll do...

2471
02:49:19,610 --> 02:49:21,230
God, it makes me feel like I could...

2472
02:49:21,370 --> 02:49:22,230
Mark of Pride.

2473
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:23,710
And then this.

2474
02:49:23,950 --> 02:49:24,510
There you go.

2475
02:49:26,450 --> 02:49:28,010
I don't know what fragile charms are.

2476
02:49:28,870 --> 02:49:30,270
What is fragile charms?

2477
02:49:32,710 --> 02:49:34,710
What do you guys mean by fragile charm?

2478
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:38,050
What is that?

2479
02:49:42,910 --> 02:49:45,630
Then he'll make some dream that'll laugh faster.

2480
02:49:46,490 --> 02:49:46,750
Wait.

2481
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:52,230
What the fuck is fragile?

2482
02:49:53,990 --> 02:49:55,990
I don't know what fragile charms are.

2483
02:49:59,320 --> 02:49:59,900
Oops.

2484
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:10,520
Get away from me!

2485
02:50:18,340 --> 02:50:19,800
Wait, where's the other one?

2486
02:50:26,430 --> 02:50:28,330
Alright, at least I'm full.

2487
02:50:30,570 --> 02:50:33,150
Oh, I don't know how to get them.

2488
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:41,060
And don't go away when... Oh!

2489
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:42,020
It's too late.

2490
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:42,680
It's fine.

2491
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:44,620
It's okay.

2492
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:46,660
We'll figure this out.

2493
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:49,840
Okay, so what do you guys... You guys said he doesn't stagger.

2494
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:51,080
How do I do it?

2495
02:50:52,360 --> 02:50:53,980
Because I did the dream now thing.

2496
02:50:54,260 --> 02:50:55,420
I do dream now and then what?

2497
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:56,160
Pogo him?

2498
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:57,620
Pogo him?

2499
02:50:57,800 --> 02:50:58,500
And then what?

2500
02:51:02,300 --> 02:51:03,420
I don't know how to make it.

2501
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:07,040
Because you said he can't get up by himself, but I dream nailed him and he got up.

2502
02:51:14,850 --> 02:51:16,650
Dream nailed twice and hit him?

2503
02:51:20,860 --> 02:51:23,260
Oh, Dream now of the armor!

2504
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:24,620
Oh!

2505
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:31,510
Okay.

2506
02:51:39,060 --> 02:51:40,500
One hit, then hit him on the...

2507
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:40,820
Okay.

2508
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:42,240
I don't know if I can actually do that.

2509
02:51:42,380 --> 02:51:42,780
I'll try.

2510
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:45,620
Okay, pull go the armor.

2511
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:46,940
Okay, I'll try and do that.

2512
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:49,360
Okay, I already fucked it up.

2513
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:54,500
Oh my god, I fucked it up twice.

2514
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:54,980
No!

2515
02:51:56,620 --> 02:51:57,400
Oh, no!

2516
02:51:58,400 --> 02:51:59,560
Oh, I restart...

2517
02:51:59,560 --> 02:52:01,160
I'm killing me.

2518
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:02,900
I fucked up.

2519
02:52:03,360 --> 02:52:07,220
I got my timing messed up.

2520
02:52:07,700 --> 02:52:09,100
I'm like, I'm overthinking.

2521
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:11,060
Okay.

2522
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:13,780
We'll grab our stuff at the bottom.

2523
02:52:15,880 --> 02:52:17,540
I was overthinking, guys.

2524
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:19,860
I was overthinking.

2525
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:25,980
Oh my god, I hate these guys so much.

2526
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:28,000
It's okay.

2527
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:29,180
I get money at least.

2528
02:52:30,020 --> 02:52:32,320
At least I get money.

2529
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:38,460
No,

2530
02:52:45,070 --> 02:52:46,450
I have to beat him now.

2531
02:52:47,710 --> 02:52:48,850
I have to beat him.

2532
02:52:48,910 --> 02:52:50,730
I don't care if he's one of the hardest.

2533
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:53,550
I have to beat him now.

2534
02:52:55,750 --> 02:52:56,990
I'm invested.

2535
02:52:57,910 --> 02:52:59,450
No, I'm invested.

2536
02:53:04,290 --> 02:53:05,970
I don't give up.

2537
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:17,400
Oh my god.

2538
02:53:17,960 --> 02:53:19,060
I hate that, though.

2539
02:53:21,980 --> 02:53:23,360
Are you serious?

2540
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:26,660
Oh my god, really?

2541
02:53:27,780 --> 02:53:29,240
I missed the pattern.

2542
02:53:38,430 --> 02:53:40,510
Oh, he landed on me!

2543
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:43,790
Hey.

2544
02:53:45,770 --> 02:53:48,670
I wish his brothers were still alive.

2545
02:53:51,890 --> 02:53:55,970
I wish his brothers were still alive.

2546
02:53:58,050 --> 02:53:59,450
Oh, no.

2547
02:54:00,890 --> 02:54:02,730
I keep forgetting that guy explodes.

2548
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:09,040
Wonder what happened to him.

2549
02:54:11,280 --> 02:54:14,200
I wonder what happened to them.

2550
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:21,820
Whose fault is that?

2551
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:23,100
Couldn't be me.

2552
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:26,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

2553
02:54:27,020 --> 02:54:29,120
I don't remember killing no brother.

2554
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:32,940
Yeah, we're up here.

2555
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:33,500
Obviously.

2556
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:37,800
I don't remember killing no brother.

2557
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:39,980
Who could it be?

2558
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:43,900
Maybe I just need to be six on.

2559
02:54:56,900 --> 02:54:58,500
Are you serious?

2560
02:55:00,900 --> 02:55:01,660
Okay.

2561
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:04,880
The fucking rock!

2562
02:55:13,470 --> 02:55:14,110
Oh, that's it.

2563
02:55:14,130 --> 02:55:15,010
I don't want to farm anymore.

2564
02:55:15,490 --> 02:55:17,950
We'll just brute force it.

2565
02:55:28,230 --> 02:55:28,550
Okay.

2566
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:37,220
A fucking course.

2567
02:55:37,380 --> 02:55:38,720
A fucking course!

2568
02:55:39,400 --> 02:55:40,500
Oh my god!

2569
02:55:47,990 --> 02:55:50,810
I got hit by four rocks!

2570
02:55:51,150 --> 02:55:53,350
We are not fighting a different boss!

2571
02:55:53,910 --> 02:55:55,290
We're right or die!

2572
02:56:05,730 --> 02:56:07,530
Oh, I shouldn't have dashed that.

2573
02:56:08,350 --> 02:56:09,010
I don't know.

2574
02:56:17,890 --> 02:56:18,450
Really?

2575
02:56:18,730 --> 02:56:19,490
That hits me?

2576
02:56:20,050 --> 02:56:21,290
Oh my god.

2577
02:56:28,850 --> 02:56:30,570
I'll never back down.

2578
02:56:34,410 --> 02:56:36,690
I know Quitter like the traitor Mantis.

2579
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:39,190
This one is actually...

2580
02:56:39,190 --> 02:56:40,870
This one is my filter now.

2581
02:56:43,510 --> 02:56:44,610
Oh my god.

02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:45,510
He's too...

2583
02:56:45,510 --> 02:56:47,630
He takes up 20% of the screen.

2584
02:56:53,680 --> 02:57:01,460
Oh my god He actually takes up like So much of the screen though Like no lie

02:57:07,300 --> 02:57:12,660

Three times Three times Three times What is this RNG?

2589
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:07,840

No, no.

2603
03:01:13,590 --> 03:01:17,230
They got a heart attack and there was a sharp object on the ground.

2604
03:01:17,810 --> 03:01:18,750
And then they fell.

2605
03:01:18,970 --> 03:01:20,650
Both of them fell on.

2606
03:01:21,010 --> 03:01:21,750
Fell on it.

2607
03:01:22,810 --> 03:01:25,610
There were two separate nails and they both fell on it.

2608
03:01:26,470 --> 03:01:28,250
It truly was very unfortunate.

2609
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:32,750
I don't know.

2610
03:01:32,930 --> 03:01:33,910
I just...

2611
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:34,850
I was just done.

2612
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:37,970
I was just so done.

2613
03:01:38,630 --> 03:01:39,090
I was...

2614
03:01:39,110 --> 03:01:39,890
So done.

2615
03:01:42,990 --> 03:01:44,770
Yeah, I have witnesses.

2616
03:01:45,150 --> 03:01:46,390
And no, witness is me.

2617
03:01:51,630 --> 03:01:51,870
Alright.

2618
03:01:52,590 --> 03:01:54,090
Eventually I'll lock in.

2619
03:01:55,770 --> 03:01:56,710
it's now!

2620
03:01:57,350 --> 03:01:58,550
No, we're not changing.

2621
03:01:59,750 --> 03:02:02,770
I will smash my head against this wall until it's over.

2622
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:07,280
I am stubborn.

2623
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:19,580
Oh, shit.

2624
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,000
Okay.

2625
03:02:33,780 --> 03:02:35,960
You can tell I'm like heavily focused right now.

2626
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:37,420
Every time I talk.

2627
03:02:38,160 --> 03:02:39,960
Every time I talk, I'm getting out of my rhythm.

2628
03:02:40,140 --> 03:02:41,780
So I should stop that.

2629
03:02:56,770 --> 03:02:57,250
Okay.

2630
03:03:16,170 --> 03:03:16,650
Okay.

2631
03:03:23,170 --> 03:03:23,650
What?

2632
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:24,990
I hit the rocks.

2633
03:03:25,650 --> 03:03:26,550
Are you serious?

2634
03:03:54,930 --> 03:03:55,410
Okay.

2635
03:03:56,690 --> 03:03:57,650
I figured...

2636
03:03:58,550 --> 03:03:59,790
I figured it out.

2637
03:04:01,250 --> 03:04:01,970
I figured it out.

2638
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:09,700
There's no...

2639
03:04:09,700 --> 03:04:12,520
I can't time it in a way where I can jump over it.

2640
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:15,600
Every time I try to jump over it, I get hit.

2641
03:04:23,430 --> 03:04:23,810
Oh my gosh.

2642
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:25,290
I think it's just reflexive for that.

2643
03:04:31,280 --> 03:04:31,660
Unlucky.

2644
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:34,860
I'm just gonna tank this one.

2645
03:04:39,740 --> 03:04:42,060
There's a rock above me.

2646
03:04:42,660 --> 03:04:43,980
Oh my god.

2647
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:47,020
Okay, I could jump.

2648
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:47,280
Okay.

2649
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:49,140
I'll show you guys what happens when I try jumping.

2650
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:52,400
He just does it too close to me.

2651
03:04:55,140 --> 03:04:55,880
I'll show you guys.

2652
03:04:55,980 --> 03:04:58,380
We tried it before, and it's...

2653
03:04:58,380 --> 03:04:59,440
I just get...

2654
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:00,560
He was just too close to me.

2655
03:05:06,710 --> 03:05:07,450
Fucking course.

2656
03:05:21,860 --> 03:05:22,260
Okay.

2657
03:05:27,140 --> 03:05:29,060
Oh, of course he does that.

2658
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:31,220
Oh!

2659
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:34,480
Yeah, but then he's lame.

2660
03:05:34,540 --> 03:05:35,620
He gets too close to me.

2661
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:37,100
When I do the jump.

2662
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:41,420
He just gets too close to me.

2663
03:05:41,980 --> 03:05:43,060
That's why I do the dash.

2664
03:05:52,290 --> 03:05:52,530
See?

2665
03:05:52,770 --> 03:05:53,550
He's too close.

2666
03:05:57,460 --> 03:05:58,480
We're back out a little bit.

2667
03:05:59,940 --> 03:06:00,120
See?

2668
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:00,480
Oh.

2669
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:02,100
I don't know.

2670
03:06:02,480 --> 03:06:04,600
The jumping is throwing me off more.

2671
03:06:10,460 --> 03:06:13,180
The jumping throws me off way more than dashing.

2672
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:21,540
I'm going to do my old playstyle.

2673
03:06:21,640 --> 03:06:22,340
Because I did the...

2674
03:06:22,360 --> 03:06:27,360
I progressed the most with my old playstyle more.

2675
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:33,600
Okay, I'm gonna be more cautious here.

2676
03:06:35,020 --> 03:06:35,360
See?

2677
03:06:43,330 --> 03:06:45,230
I'll back away just because.

2678
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:53,700
Oh, I didn't realize he was in front of me.

2679
03:06:54,100 --> 03:06:54,580
That's unlucky.

2680
03:06:57,740 --> 03:06:59,980
I didn't realize he was gonna, he was in front of me.

2681
03:07:02,740 --> 03:07:03,300
All right.

2682
03:07:16,260 --> 03:07:17,440
All right, okay.

2683
03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:18,820
Oops.

2684
03:07:21,500 --> 03:07:22,220
I'm going to reset this.

2685
03:07:22,380 --> 03:07:23,140
I'm resetting this.

2686
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:25,120
I'm resetting this.

2687
03:07:25,320 --> 03:07:26,300
I was trying to...

2688
03:07:26,300 --> 03:07:27,640
I had to hydrate.

2689
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:31,560
I had to hydrate.

2690
03:07:31,900 --> 03:07:32,820
I had to reset it.

2691
03:07:35,380 --> 03:07:37,460
I had to drink water.

2692
03:07:39,220 --> 03:07:40,440
Because I'm thirsty.

2693
03:07:44,060 --> 03:07:45,780
This is the biggest wall I've hit.

2694
03:07:46,260 --> 03:07:46,740
For sure.

2695
03:08:03,940 --> 03:08:04,280
Oh, no.

2696
03:08:04,420 --> 03:08:05,200
I wanted to double jump.

2697
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:06,220
Oh.

2698
03:08:09,380 --> 03:08:11,260
Oh, I already used my dash.

2699
03:08:11,400 --> 03:08:12,420
I didn't know.

2700
03:08:27,970 --> 03:08:28,510
Oh.

2701
03:08:28,990 --> 03:08:30,650
The rocks.

2702
03:08:32,290 --> 03:08:33,050
Not fair.

2703
03:08:33,750 --> 03:08:34,610
Not fair.

2704
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:40,580
Not the rocks.

2705
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:46,600
Why can't the RNG of the rocks be closed before they're away?

2706
03:08:46,860 --> 03:08:54,380
Oh my god, are you sure we used rocks again?

2707
03:09:11,550 --> 03:09:12,130
Burn it!

2708
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:15,070
Your mom fucking hated you.

2709
03:09:15,210 --> 03:09:16,310
That's why you're orphans.

2710
03:09:19,880 --> 03:09:21,380
At least my mom's still alive.

2711
03:09:28,900 --> 03:09:31,700
Surely the other dreams are like easier, right?

2712
03:09:32,300 --> 03:09:32,900
Surely.

2713
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:36,120
I'm fucking curious I get hit by the rock.

2714
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:39,200
This is a rock day.

2715
03:09:51,170 --> 03:09:52,210
All right.

2716
03:09:57,290 --> 03:09:58,350
All right.

2717
03:10:01,030 --> 03:10:01,370
Whoa.

2718
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:02,250
Three.

2719
03:10:03,470 --> 03:10:03,590
Whoa.

2720
03:10:03,970 --> 03:10:05,290
Wait, how did that not hit me?

2721
03:10:08,130 --> 03:10:08,230
Whoa.

2722
03:10:09,270 --> 03:10:09,410
Whoa.

2723
03:10:10,230 --> 03:10:10,590
Whoa.

2724
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:14,880
Whoa.

2725
03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:18,000
Nice.

2726
03:10:23,930 --> 03:10:25,530
I'm yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2727
03:10:32,710 --> 03:10:34,070
I'm yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2728
03:10:38,890 --> 03:10:39,510
What?

2729
03:10:41,270 --> 03:10:42,390
Okay, I threw that.

2730
03:10:42,510 --> 03:10:43,410
Oh, I threw that.

2731
03:10:43,830 --> 03:10:44,630
I'm sorry.

2732
03:10:45,390 --> 03:10:46,010
I threw.

2733
03:10:48,330 --> 03:10:48,950
I threw.

2734
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:03,180
I got scared.

2735
03:11:17,820 --> 03:11:19,880
Okay, I think I got it.

2736
03:11:20,420 --> 03:11:22,920
I think I downloaded it for real now.

2737
03:11:23,380 --> 03:11:24,000
Okay.

2738
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:29,120
It's a hard...

2739
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:29,600
You know what?

2740
03:11:29,680 --> 03:11:30,280
Fuck this.

2741
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:40,550
Now it's...

2742
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:42,330
Now it'll be easy.

2743
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:48,780
This is all I need.

2744
03:11:53,820 --> 03:11:55,220
I just need a big wick.

2745
03:12:01,440 --> 03:12:02,020
Oh shit.

2746
03:12:02,980 --> 03:12:03,940
You know, I thought he would.

2747
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:09,240
Oh my god, not the goddamn rock.

2748
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:12,220
Yeah.

2749
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:14,820
Oh, what?

2750
03:12:17,020 --> 03:12:17,520
Nice.

2751
03:12:25,620 --> 03:12:26,340
Okay.

2752
03:12:27,860 --> 03:12:28,440
Oh, wait.

2753
03:12:28,800 --> 03:12:30,000
I'm alcoholic now.

2754
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,520
Look, look,

2755
03:12:36,020 --> 03:12:37,160
look, look, look, look.

2756
03:12:37,720 --> 03:12:38,920
Give me a sec.

2757
03:12:39,080 --> 03:12:39,900
I gotta be an alcoholic.

2758
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:43,480
Alcoholic.

2759
03:12:46,760 --> 03:12:48,090
Good little luck.

2760
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:52,740
I gotta be an alcoholic still.

2761
03:12:54,140 --> 03:12:55,540
I gotta keep being an alcoholic.

2762
03:13:01,380 --> 03:13:02,800
There you go.

2763
03:13:12,490 --> 03:13:13,370
Okay, that's unlucky.

2764
03:13:13,710 --> 03:13:14,690
That is so unlucky.

2765
03:13:14,950 --> 03:13:18,210
Oh my god, that is so unlucky for me!

2766
03:13:20,330 --> 03:13:23,250
Okay, I think I did my best run as Rick.

2767
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:26,130
That's Rick Sanchez.

2768
03:13:26,670 --> 03:13:30,230
I think I lock it hard.

2769
03:13:30,650 --> 03:13:31,610
It has Rick Sanchez.

2770
03:13:32,470 --> 03:13:34,270
I figured it out.

2771
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:43,980
Wait, what the fuck?

2772
03:13:44,740 --> 03:13:45,940
Couldn't like...

2773
03:13:47,260 --> 03:13:48,800
Oh my god, that's unlucky.

2774
03:13:52,610 --> 03:13:54,590
Oh, I think it does the dash...

2775
03:13:58,350 --> 03:13:59,690
Not the rocks.

2776
03:14:01,710 --> 03:14:03,330
Oh my god.

2777
03:14:04,410 --> 03:14:04,870
Oh.

2778
03:14:10,740 --> 03:14:11,060
Okay.

2779
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:11,980
JK.

2780
03:14:12,760 --> 03:14:14,540
Maybe not as Rick Sanchez.

2781
03:14:14,920 --> 03:14:15,100
Okay.

2782
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:17,080
Maybe it's time.

2783
03:14:17,360 --> 03:14:19,300
This feels like the dark souls of...

2784
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:22,220
This feels like the dark souls of Metrovania.

2785
03:14:23,140 --> 03:14:24,160
Maybe it's time.

2786
03:14:29,360 --> 03:14:30,000
Okay.

2787
03:14:31,820 --> 03:14:34,000
It's the dark souls of Metrovania.

2788
03:14:34,820 --> 03:14:36,140
It feels a Appropriate.

2789
03:14:36,880 --> 03:14:37,480
Praise the sun.

2790
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:51,700
Oh god.

2791
03:14:57,920 --> 03:14:58,380
Praise the sun.

2792
03:15:01,780 --> 03:15:02,840
Oh shit.

2793
03:15:03,440 --> 03:15:05,020
I didn't think that he was doing that move.

2794
03:15:17,440 --> 03:15:18,480
Are you serious?

2795
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:23,280
There we go.

2796
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:31,620
I'm drinking my flask real quick.

2797
03:15:38,130 --> 03:15:38,390
Okay.

2798
03:15:38,990 --> 03:15:39,990
Drinking the flask.

2799
03:15:42,030 --> 03:15:43,670
drinking my estes

2800
03:15:47,070 --> 03:15:50,030

2801
03:15:53,690 --> 03:15:59,320
he baited me he baited me so hot

2802
03:16:06,740 --> 03:16:14,800
he actually baited me so hot he got out of

2803
03:16:18,850 --> 03:16:27,490
I will beat him if it's I swear to you guys I swear I feel like the last boss, it's gonna be easier than this shit.

2804
03:16:30,610 --> 03:16:32,490
I will never give up.

2805
03:16:33,210 --> 03:16:34,290
I ain't no quitter.

2806
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,160
That's because I should never corner him.

2807
03:16:54,680 --> 03:16:56,680
I need to give him enough room.

2808
03:17:01,200 --> 03:17:03,440
Because he can't do his little, the speed.

2809
03:17:06,140 --> 03:17:11,080
He can't do his little thingy when I'm too far from him.

2810
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:31,040
I feel like playing I feel like I'm playing the dark souls right now of Metrovania this feels like how I feel normally in dark souls someone praise the Sun for me if you praise the Sun you'll free me

2811
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:46,520
praise the Sun to free me from this torment yeah

2812
03:17:54,230 --> 03:17:57,910
oh Um, stupid rock.

2813
03:18:05,110 --> 03:18:05,470
Okay.

2814
03:18:07,910 --> 03:18:09,590
He's gonna do the fire strike.

2815
03:18:13,070 --> 03:18:15,510
Oh my god, he's gonna keep doing the fire strike.

2816
03:18:17,350 --> 03:18:17,730
Oh!

2817
03:18:19,170 --> 03:18:19,590
Oh!

2818
03:18:20,630 --> 03:18:22,330
They hit the rock!

2819
03:18:25,360 --> 03:18:28,660
One day, I'll see what the second stagger looks like.

2820
03:18:29,560 --> 03:18:30,280
One day.

2821
03:18:32,140 --> 03:18:32,640
Okay.

2822
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:36,100
This is why I started the stream at 4 12 30.

2823
03:18:36,420 --> 03:18:38,070
I knew this was going to be a long haul

2824
03:18:42,600 --> 03:18:43,840

Too many rocks.

We will die here on this stream.

2837
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:04,300
Until I defeat the stupid boss.

2838
03:20:12,940 --> 03:20:14,300
Call your loved ones.

We will die here.

2842
03:20:38,810 --> 03:20:41,090
Make sure to call your loved ones.

2843
03:20:41,250 --> 03:20:42,010
God damn it.

2844
03:20:43,310 --> 03:20:47,130
Oh, of course, of course.

2845
03:20:47,990 --> 03:20:48,550
Here we go.

2846
03:20:52,600 --> 03:20:59,280
This will be your final resting place at this particular boss.

2847
03:21:04,220 --> 03:21:05,800
This might as well be the true ending.

2848
03:21:10,880 --> 03:21:13,180
This is my true ending, killing him.

2849
03:21:20,810 --> 03:21:23,850
I feel like the rocks never fell before

2850
03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:51,360
It was only for It's only for this dream land where the rocks fell right Because I swear to God I feel like they know I feel like the environment wasn't involved in this area Oh my god that was on me I got greedy there I don't remember He was the first one I ever fought

2851
03:22:01,930 --> 03:22:04,050
I'm trying to just go straight to the parkour.

2852
03:22:04,610 --> 03:22:05,510
Oh, wait, I can't.

2853
03:22:05,790 --> 03:22:07,690
Because I need my essence, too.

2854
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:15,380
I forgot.

2855
03:22:15,540 --> 03:22:16,180
I can't even.

2856
03:22:23,480 --> 03:22:25,420
Oh, the rock messed with the timing.

2857
03:22:33,390 --> 03:22:33,930
Oh.

2858
03:22:34,590 --> 03:22:35,750
He didn't do it.

2859
03:22:35,910 --> 03:22:37,670
That was his jump back.

2860
03:22:41,160 --> 03:22:43,840
I'll see the first dagger again someday.

2861
03:22:45,100 --> 03:22:46,240
I believe it.

2862
03:22:46,820 --> 03:22:48,760
I believe I'll see it.

2863
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:50,620
It's there.

2864
03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:52,160
It's right there.

2865
03:22:55,760 --> 03:22:58,440
Okay, he does his fire strike.

2866
03:23:03,210 --> 03:23:08,610
Okay, he does his fire strike when he jumps back, which I've noticed now.

2867
03:23:11,570 --> 03:23:12,950
Okay, fire strike.

2868
03:23:19,640 --> 03:23:21,180
Okay, fire strike.

2869
03:23:23,860 --> 03:23:24,860
Fire strike.

2870
03:23:29,640 --> 03:23:30,640
Nice!

2871
03:23:44,320 --> 03:23:44,420
Okay.

2872
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:49,000
Fine, we're just chilling here.

2873
03:23:51,500 --> 03:23:52,880
Until this tempered chantrum is good.

2874
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:56,140
Okay, he did not...

2875
03:23:56,140 --> 03:23:56,560
Okay.

2876
03:23:58,400 --> 03:23:59,840
Okay, fire strike.

2877
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:04,080
Okay.

2878
03:24:07,320 --> 03:24:09,800
Alright, that was not a jump back, but that's okay.

2879
03:24:15,470 --> 03:24:16,750
Okay, fire strike.

2880
03:24:23,330 --> 03:24:24,490
Okay, fire strike.

2881
03:24:26,370 --> 03:24:26,730
Alright.

2882
03:24:29,350 --> 03:24:30,070
Dream!

2883
03:24:32,590 --> 03:24:33,310
Dream!

2884
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:34,650
Okay.

2885
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,380
Okay, we're going back here a little bit.

2886
03:24:49,200 --> 03:24:49,880
Okay, fire strike.

2887
03:24:58,780 --> 03:25:00,460
Oh, fire strike.

2888
03:25:01,140 --> 03:25:02,480
Fire strike.

2889
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:03,980
Fire strike.

2890
03:25:04,720 --> 03:25:05,500
Oh, shit!

2891
03:25:10,220 --> 03:25:11,820
Oh, shit!

2892
03:25:12,440 --> 03:25:12,560
Oh.

2893
03:25:14,140 --> 03:25:14,940
Dream?

2894
03:25:17,700 --> 03:25:18,720
Assess, assess, assess.

2895
03:25:19,300 --> 03:25:19,380
Look,

2896
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:25,080

Oh my god, that was the furthest I've ever got!

2899
03:26:06,610 --> 03:26:08,330
I got the pattern down.

2900
03:26:12,110 --> 03:26:13,210
Fire strike!

2901
03:26:13,590 --> 03:26:14,950
I just gotta call it out.

2902
03:26:16,650 --> 03:26:17,470
Oh my god.

2903
03:26:18,970 --> 03:26:20,690
I think I just have to call it out.

2904
03:26:26,060 --> 03:26:27,260
It's doing again.

2905
03:26:28,980 --> 03:26:29,740
What the fuck?

2906
03:26:30,740 --> 03:26:31,580
So many.

2907
03:26:48,920 --> 03:26:49,680
Oh,

2908
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:55,820
I got a pattern down finally at least.

2909
03:27:07,380 --> 03:27:08,100
Okay, nice.

2910
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:13,780
Dream!

2911
03:27:18,500 --> 03:27:19,740
Oh wait, I didn't need to do that.

2912
03:27:20,940 --> 03:27:21,860
Oh my God, I didn't need to do that.

2913
03:27:22,240 --> 03:27:26,400
Oh my God, I was, I got to, oh I panicked.

2914
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:35,480
I panicked there.

2915
03:27:37,160 --> 03:27:37,400
Oh!

2916
03:27:37,680 --> 03:27:38,580
No, I panicked!

2917
03:27:48,460 --> 03:27:49,820
Oh, ah, strike!

2918
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:54,520

Oh, fuck.

03:28:32,430 --> 03:28:33,530
Fire strike!

2927
03:28:36,110 --> 03:28:42,650
That's the only way I have to call it out so I know he's gonna do what he didn't back up

I don't know!

2932
03:29:40,620 --> 03:29:43,140
He didn't jump back!

2933
03:29:53,170 --> 03:29:53,890
Oh!

2934
03:29:57,290 --> 03:29:58,350

2940
03:30:46,640 --> 03:30:48,340
Oh, I can only do one thing.

2941
03:30:48,740 --> 03:30:49,140

Yeah, I know it doesn't do damage.

2945
03:31:04,860 --> 03:31:08,560
I'm trying to... I don't care that I'm not doing damage to his face.

2946
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:10,220
I just want to heal.

2947
03:31:10,760 --> 03:31:11,860
Because I have no HP.

2948
03:31:12,980 --> 03:31:13,820
That's what I'm doing.

2949
03:31:15,380 --> 03:31:16,500
Okay, I'm resetting.

2950
03:31:16,580 --> 03:31:17,720
Because I was talking to chat.

2951
03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:19,480
I'm going to reset.

2952
03:31:29,770 --> 03:31:30,790
Am I not supposed...

2953
03:31:30,790 --> 03:31:31,930
Okay, I'll stop healing then.

2954
03:31:32,030 --> 03:31:33,430
Since you guys told me to stop healing.

2955
03:31:33,770 --> 03:31:34,370
I won't heal.

2956
03:31:34,490 --> 03:31:35,830
I just focus on the face.

2957
03:31:36,350 --> 03:31:37,650
I thought I was supposed to heal.

2958
03:31:44,190 --> 03:31:44,990
I'll just...

2959
03:31:45,010 --> 03:31:45,790
stop healing.

2960
03:31:47,830 --> 03:31:48,990
I don't know why I'm...

2961
03:31:48,990 --> 03:31:49,630
Why am I paused?

2962
03:31:49,950 --> 03:31:49,950
Wait.

2963
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:51,710
Why is my motto?

2964
03:31:52,130 --> 03:31:53,350
Why is my skin suit broken?

2965
03:31:54,830 --> 03:31:55,310
Hmm.

2966
03:31:55,970 --> 03:31:56,630
Okay, now it's back.

2967
03:31:56,870 --> 03:31:57,630
And I fix it?

2968
03:31:59,330 --> 03:31:59,810
Oh,

2969
03:32:05,610 --> 03:32:06,190
stop healing.

2970
03:32:06,330 --> 03:32:07,370
Because you guys told me to.

2971
03:32:14,090 --> 03:32:14,570
Okay.

2972
03:32:16,090 --> 03:32:16,910
Fire strike!

2973
03:32:17,310 --> 03:32:18,170
Fire strike!

2974
03:32:20,270 --> 03:32:20,890
Okay.

2975
03:32:22,670 --> 03:32:23,050
Fast strike!

2976
03:32:26,530 --> 03:32:27,630
Fast strike!

2977
03:32:28,390 --> 03:32:28,810
Fast strike!

2978
03:32:29,270 --> 03:32:31,390
Oh shit.

2979
03:32:32,610 --> 03:32:33,340
Okay, he's backing up.

2980
03:32:34,610 --> 03:32:34,990
Fast strike!

2981
03:32:35,750 --> 03:32:36,450
He's doing another one.

2982
03:32:37,090 --> 03:32:37,410
Fast strike!

2983
03:32:38,030 --> 03:32:38,990
Fast strike!

2984
03:32:39,570 --> 03:32:39,770
Okay.

2985
03:32:43,800 --> 03:32:45,380
Okay, he's gonna do a fast strike here.

2986
03:32:45,940 --> 03:32:46,220
Fast strike!

2987
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:48,180
Oh my god.

2988
03:32:48,500 --> 03:32:50,220
That was, I should have went up harder.

2989
03:32:50,760 --> 03:32:51,620
Fast strike!

2990
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:52,840
Oh no!

2991
03:32:53,580 --> 03:32:54,460
Don't worry.

2992
03:33:04,650 --> 03:33:05,090
Fast strike!

2993
03:33:06,110 --> 03:33:06,630
Oh!

2994
03:33:07,230 --> 03:33:08,170
I dashed too close.

2995
03:33:08,750 --> 03:33:09,950
I'm out of my rhythm now.

2996
03:33:27,330 --> 03:33:28,910
Okay, he's gonna do the fast strike.

2997
03:33:29,850 --> 03:33:30,810
He's gonna do it again.

2998
03:33:31,650 --> 03:33:33,250
Oh my god, so soon?

2999
03:33:35,270 --> 03:33:36,990
Oh my god, stop!

3000
03:33:40,650 --> 03:33:42,950
Okay, I need Tim to be...

3001
03:33:42,950 --> 03:33:44,770
Dude, why are you doing so much fast?

3002
03:33:44,790 --> 03:33:46,550
Fast strike, Minoyaki.

3003
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,210
Again?

3004
03:33:49,090 --> 03:33:50,110
You're so greedy.

3005
03:33:50,390 --> 03:33:50,950
Again?

3006
03:33:52,530 --> 03:33:53,970
Holy shit.

3007
03:33:54,850 --> 03:33:56,170
Learn something new.

3008
03:34:03,840 --> 03:34:05,060
Okay, nice.

3009
03:34:05,200 --> 03:34:06,740
Now he's using something new.

3010
03:34:08,440 --> 03:34:08,840
Oh, my God.

3011
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:09,800
Fast strike.

3012
03:34:12,300 --> 03:34:13,080
Fast strike.

3013
03:34:16,340 --> 03:34:17,620
Fast strike.

3014
03:34:23,130 --> 03:34:23,650
Nice.

3015
03:34:24,550 --> 03:34:24,550
Okay.

3016
03:34:29,370 --> 03:34:30,790
There you go.

3017
03:34:38,650 --> 03:34:43,590
I'm gonna back up, because I feel like I won't be able to see when he does his thing.

3018
03:34:45,030 --> 03:34:45,910
Okay, fire strike.

3019
03:34:47,210 --> 03:34:48,150
Fire strike.

3020
03:34:48,890 --> 03:34:49,510
Fire strike.

3021
03:34:53,130 --> 03:34:53,950
Oh, shit!

3022
03:34:54,270 --> 03:34:54,850
Oh, my God.

3023
03:34:54,970 --> 03:34:55,910
I dived into the rocks.

3024
03:34:56,470 --> 03:34:57,530
That's unlucky for me.

3025
03:35:01,210 --> 03:35:03,490
Okay, I need to make him back up a little bit more.

3026
03:35:12,090 --> 03:35:12,510
Fire strike!

3027
03:35:16,930 --> 03:35:19,910
I had a feeling I was going to do a random fire strike there.

3028
03:35:20,050 --> 03:35:21,350
Because he's super...

3029
03:35:21,350 --> 03:35:22,090
Fire strike.

3030
03:35:24,830 --> 03:35:25,390
What?

3031
03:35:26,770 --> 03:35:27,330
Oh!

3032
03:35:27,970 --> 03:35:29,290
He landed on me!

3033
03:35:31,290 --> 03:35:31,830
Okay.

3034
03:35:33,330 --> 03:35:35,170
Calling fire strike actually helps me so.

3035
03:35:35,190 --> 03:35:59,880
much because it makes me aware when he's doing it it makes my brain be like oh he's gonna fire strike i was like yes yes he is what oh it's just a fire strike it's because i didn't call it out see i told you i told you oh my god oops

3036
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:10,560
i told you only when i call it out am i aware of the fire strike Fire strike.

3037
03:36:12,700 --> 03:36:13,280
Fire strike.

3038
03:36:14,320 --> 03:36:14,540
Oh.

3039
03:36:14,940 --> 03:36:15,640
What the fuck?

3040
03:36:15,800 --> 03:36:16,980
That was such a small jump.

3041
03:36:18,440 --> 03:36:21,000
When did you become a goddamn fucking baby?

3042
03:36:21,960 --> 03:36:22,900
Alright, here we go.

3043
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:25,460

3044
03:36:36,860 --> 03:36:38,100
Oh, what?

3045
03:36:39,980 --> 03:36:40,820
Fire strike.

3046
03:36:41,480 --> 03:36:42,440
Oh, shit.

3047
03:36:45,740 --> 03:36:47,380
Doing things that I'm not used to.

3048
03:36:48,040 --> 03:36:48,300
Fire strike.

3049
03:36:48,320 --> 03:36:49,060
Fire strike!

3050
03:36:52,660 --> 03:36:53,060
Fire strike!

3051
03:36:54,580 --> 03:36:56,280
It's so fucking dumb.

3052
03:36:57,220 --> 03:36:57,640
Fire strike!

3053
03:36:58,460 --> 03:36:59,320
Fire strike!

3054
03:36:59,680 --> 03:37:02,480
It's the only way you don't understand.

3055
03:37:04,520 --> 03:37:05,240
Fire strike!

3056
03:37:05,780 --> 03:37:06,860
Fire strike!

3057
03:37:07,660 --> 03:37:12,700
Aww I thought you would, like, jump further.

3058
03:37:15,640 --> 03:37:17,040
Legitimately thought you would jump further.

3059
03:37:29,100 --> 03:37:29,520
Alright.

3060
03:37:32,260 --> 03:37:32,800
Fire strike!

3061
03:37:33,520 --> 03:37:34,740
Please die.

3062
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:37,800
I'm trying to get the fire strike going.

3063
03:37:45,410 --> 03:37:46,670
Oh shit, fire strike.

3064
03:37:47,250 --> 03:37:47,670

03:38:36,960 --> 03:38:37,200
Okay.

3077
03:38:37,200 --> 03:38:37,840
Can I just do that?

3078
03:38:42,340 --> 03:38:44,260
Okay, I don't know how...

3079
03:38:44,260 --> 03:38:45,140
Okay, fire strike time.

03:39:11,740 --> 03:39:14,240
Oh, fire strike!

3091
03:39:14,540 --> 03:39:17,520

Okay.

3109
03:41:49,230 --> 03:41:49,890
Firestrength!

3110
03:41:54,250 --> 03:41:54,910
Firestrength!?

3111
03:41:54,910 --> 03:41:56,110
Hello?

3112
03:42:00,050 --> 03:42:01,070
That's it.

3113
03:42:07,570 --> 03:42:08,230
It's time.

3114
03:42:10,750 --> 03:42:13,710
I'm yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, y'all.

3115
03:42:14,690 --> 03:42:15,350
It's time.

3116
03:42:15,670 --> 03:42:16,830
Get in my belly.

3117
03:42:17,950 --> 03:42:19,490
I'm so hungry.

3118
03:42:23,370 --> 03:42:24,170
That's it.

3119
03:42:25,130 --> 03:42:25,630
That's right.

3120
03:42:26,570 --> 03:42:28,130
Get in my belly.

3121
03:42:30,850 --> 03:42:33,790
What I saw that night sleeping safe in this big armored shell.

3122
03:42:34,450 --> 03:42:36,090
It wasn't madness that drove me to it.

3123
03:42:36,610 --> 03:42:37,570
I just wanted it.

3124
03:42:38,070 --> 03:42:41,870
But in the end, if strength cannot save you, then what can?

3125
03:42:49,610 --> 03:42:50,970
That's fucking right.

3126
03:42:51,510 --> 03:42:52,730
in my belly.

3127
03:42:53,370 --> 03:42:55,090
Get in!

3128
03:42:55,310 --> 03:42:56,850
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

3129
03:42:56,950 --> 03:42:59,030
I fucking finally did it.

3130
03:42:59,690 --> 03:43:01,470
Oh my god.

3131
03:43:02,250 --> 03:43:02,680
It's...

3132
03:43:03,110 --> 03:43:03,750
Sorry.

3133
03:43:04,110 --> 03:43:05,370
I was on dialed up.

3134
03:43:05,430 --> 03:43:06,970
I finally downloaded.

3135
03:43:07,770 --> 03:43:09,230
Oh my god.

3136
03:43:09,410 --> 03:43:11,430
I finally locked it.

3137
03:43:12,230 --> 03:43:14,830
We fucking did it.

3138
03:43:15,430 --> 03:43:18,450
Hey, welcome to the tomato farm.

3139
03:43:18,950 --> 03:43:20,330
Welcome, welcome.

3140
03:43:21,510 --> 03:43:26,510
Oh my god, I actually fucking did it.

3141
03:43:26,850 --> 03:43:29,610
That was, oh my god.

3142
03:43:30,290 --> 03:43:32,870
That was actually my wall.

3143
03:43:33,130 --> 03:43:34,870
That was my, I'm gonna feed dad.

3144
03:43:35,350 --> 03:43:36,670
I, you're back, he's hungry.

3145
03:43:36,990 --> 03:43:37,770
He wants his dinner.

3146
03:43:37,990 --> 03:43:39,070
Go ahead, thank you for that.

3147
03:43:39,270 --> 03:43:40,890
Give the shit, thank you, thank you.

3148
03:43:41,590 --> 03:43:41,910
Oh,

3149
03:43:56,190 --> 03:44:00,550
that was my biggest wall there.

3150
03:44:01,310 --> 03:44:05,970
Oh, that is, yeah, I finally, I figured it out.

3151
03:44:06,610 --> 03:44:06,870
I...

3152
03:44:06,870 --> 03:44:07,610
Oh my god.

3153
03:44:07,710 --> 03:44:08,410
I swear to God.

3154
03:44:08,510 --> 03:44:10,790
I feel like the end boss would not be as hard as that.

3155
03:44:10,890 --> 03:44:11,730
There's no way.

3156
03:44:16,110 --> 03:44:17,330
Oh my god.

3157
03:44:18,030 --> 03:44:18,750
Biggest wall.

3158
03:44:18,970 --> 03:44:19,710
So far.

3159
03:44:21,250 --> 03:44:23,090
It must stream like for my surgery tomorrow.

3160
03:44:23,370 --> 03:44:24,070
Well, I'm not nervous.

3161
03:44:24,170 --> 03:44:25,050
It does make me sad.

3162
03:44:26,070 --> 03:44:27,390
I won't be able to use my hand for a while.

3163
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:27,970
Oh my god.

3164
03:44:28,030 --> 03:44:29,450
I hope you get luck with your surgery.

3165
03:44:29,990 --> 03:44:31,670
And I hope your recovery is fast.

3166
03:44:31,990 --> 03:44:32,790
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

3167
03:44:32,870 --> 03:44:33,570
Thank you.

3168
03:44:34,710 --> 03:44:35,570
Holy fuck.

3169
03:44:36,390 --> 03:44:39,130
That was actually so hard.

3170
03:44:40,250 --> 03:44:43,150
It was the times two damage.

3171
03:44:43,610 --> 03:44:47,890
We're financially, we do not go after the other Dream bosses.

3172
03:44:48,090 --> 03:44:52,210
You can get Dream 1800 off just the Dream Warriors now.

3173
03:44:52,510 --> 03:44:53,050
Oh, shit.

3174
03:44:53,130 --> 03:44:53,750
Let's go.

3175
03:44:55,150 --> 03:44:55,530
Yay.

3176
03:44:56,150 --> 03:45:00,330
Or unless, what if, okay, what if I do one more Dream boss?

3177
03:45:00,810 --> 03:45:01,470
That's cute.

3178
03:45:01,550 --> 03:45:02,950
Thank you for the super chat.

3179
03:45:03,230 --> 03:45:03,370
Thank you.

3180
03:45:03,470 --> 03:45:03,950
Thank you.

3181
03:45:04,710 --> 03:45:06,090
You can't stop me.

3182
03:45:06,490 --> 03:45:11,210
I'm gonna go after one more dream boss wherever he is unless

3183
03:45:15,450 --> 03:45:17,550
You can't stop me.

3184
03:45:17,770 --> 03:45:21,790
You can't tell me what to do That's right.

3185
03:45:22,150 --> 03:45:23,610
I don't know where it is though.

3186
03:45:23,710 --> 03:45:27,390
I don't know where any of the that was the only dream boss I knew

3187
03:45:31,650 --> 03:45:35,370
All right, which is okay now which one is the easy.

3188
03:45:35,670 --> 03:45:38,010
Okay, this is bad because I actually don't know where to go.

03:45:42,830 --> 03:45:43,950
So Unsanctum.

3190
03:45:45,210 --> 03:45:46,970
Wait, isn't he a hard boss?

3191
03:45:49,010 --> 03:45:50,570

When we're up.

3319
03:52:11,520 --> 03:52:13,260
Oh, I hate these guys so much.

03:52:19,860 --> 03:52:21,420
I can't even reach them.

3324
03:52:22,020 --> 03:52:22,900
They're so lucky.

3325
03:52:25,980 --> 03:52:27,960
Get away from it!

3326
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:30,340
Okay, there we go.

3327
03:52:32,020 --> 03:52:33,540
With pure anger, I shall live.

03:52:35,060 --> 03:52:36,240
Except for that guy.

3329
03:52:37,260 --> 03:52:41,350
Okay, now we go left.

3330
03:52:47,070 --> 03:52:47,750
Wait, what?

3331
03:52:47,990 --> 03:52:49,510
Why did I dash backwards?

3332
03:52:53,700 --> 03:52:54,200
Okay.

3333
03:52:57,620 --> 03:52:58,280

Here we go.

3340
03:53:24,610 --> 03:53:27,230

3387
03:57:14,530 --> 03:57:14,790
Down!

3388
03:57:14,950 --> 03:57:15,670

Okay.

3390
03:57:18,590 --> 03:57:19,870
I'm gonna die, though.

3391
03:57:20,930 --> 03:57:24,530
You're like, I have so little opportunity to kill them.

3392
03:57:27,870 --> 03:57:28,310
Yeah.

3393
03:57:31,310 --> 03:57:32,170

3404
03:59:09,330 --> 03:59:10,330
Okay, nice.

3405
03:59:14,150 --> 03:59:15,070

Also, I don't care.

I feel like I can heal too.

3409
03:59:26,310 --> 03:59:27,510
Okay, that hits him at least.

3410
03:59:29,630 --> 03:59:30,990
I'll tank it.

3411
03:59:38,830 --> 03:59:38,970

03:59:42,590 --> 03:59:43,290
Just a little guy.

3414
03:59:43,430 --> 03:59:43,610
Yippee!

3415
03:59:44,170 --> 03:59:44,670

Okay, I got it.

3419
03:59:55,250 --> 03:59:55,850
I got the pattern.

3420
03:59:58,050 --> 03:59:59,270
Get over here!

3421
03:59:59,630 --> 04:00:00,570
Oh, shit, not here!

3422
04:00:02,150 --> 04:00:03,190
I didn't mean there!

3423
04:00:06,290 --> 04:00:07,710
That's not what I mean!

3424
04:00:15,260 --> 04:00:17,460
They're like, you told him to get over here.

3425
04:00:19,080 --> 04:00:20,320
Okay, but not like that.

3426
04:00:21,460 --> 04:00:22,180
Oh, my God.

3427
04:00:25,600 --> 04:00:26,240
Okay.

3428
04:00:31,600 --> 04:00:33,400
Are you serious?

3429
04:00:34,160 --> 04:00:35,320
How do you even see where I am?

3430
04:00:38,520 --> 04:00:41,300

Okay, that hit him.

04:01:00,440 --> 04:01:01,180
That's good.

3434
04:01:05,160 --> 04:01:05,700
Please!

3435
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:08,980
Okay, I got one hit.

3436
04:01:10,360 --> 04:01:10,720
Nice.

3437
04:01:12,640 --> 04:01:13,960
Got the other dash.

3438
04:01:15,240 --> 04:01:15,400
Oh!

3439
04:01:16,720 --> 04:01:17,040
Oh!

3440
04:01:20,500 --> 04:01:22,340
Okay, I know that hits him at least.

3441
04:01:25,420 --> 04:01:26,920
And I get free hit here.

3442
04:01:31,060 --> 04:01:32,740
Oh my god, I hope he does this more.

3443
04:01:37,680 --> 04:01:39,120
At the jump?

3444
04:01:42,500 --> 04:01:43,020
Oh, shit!

3445
04:01:43,520 --> 04:01:44,320
Wrong direction!

3446
04:01:50,900 --> 04:01:52,440
Please get over here.

3447
04:01:57,320 --> 04:01:58,220
All right.

3448
04:02:00,340 --> 04:02:01,420
Oh, that was close.

3449
04:02:04,880 --> 04:02:05,520
Oh.

3450
04:02:06,820 --> 04:02:07,160
Oh.

3451
04:02:08,120 --> 04:02:08,480
Oh.

3452
04:02:08,560 --> 04:02:12,500
Oh, shit.

3453
04:02:13,060 --> 04:02:15,840
I pressed nail instead of magic.

3454
04:02:18,900 --> 04:02:19,240
Eh.

3455
04:02:23,600 --> 04:02:25,640
Oh, you know what?

3456
04:02:25,660 --> 04:02:26,100
Fuck this.

3457
04:02:27,760 --> 04:02:28,640
Ah, shit, I'm sorry.

3458
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:30,780
I didn't mean it!

3459
04:02:33,100 --> 04:02:34,300
Okay, maybe...

3460
04:02:34,300 --> 04:02:36,020
Maybe I should have eight more.

3461
04:02:38,520 --> 04:02:39,860
Yeah, I should have eight more.

3462
04:02:40,580 --> 04:02:41,400
I got greedy.

3463
04:02:42,500 --> 04:02:43,640
The greed was real.

3464
04:02:44,600 --> 04:02:45,680
I got so greedy.

3465
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:48,060
I was like...

3466
04:02:48,060 --> 04:02:48,340
Oh!

3467
04:02:55,080 --> 04:02:56,080
That was close.

3468
04:02:56,780 --> 04:02:57,380
Oh!

3469
04:03:03,820 --> 04:03:05,740
Okay, oh shit second face.

3470
04:03:06,020 --> 04:03:07,820
Oh, I forgot he had a second face.

3471
04:03:08,100 --> 04:03:08,880
No, no!

3472
04:03:10,200 --> 04:03:15,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

3473
04:03:16,560 --> 04:03:17,080
Oh, my god.

3474
04:03:18,440 --> 04:03:20,760
Oh, I don't remember what you're doing against the second face.

3475
04:03:21,100 --> 04:03:21,840
I don't remember.

3476
04:03:22,540 --> 04:03:23,680
Oh, I don't remember.

3477
04:03:24,500 --> 04:03:24,600
Oh!

3478
04:03:27,400 --> 04:03:28,760
Oh, he fucked up.

3482
04:04:03,750 --> 04:04:06,410
I forgot about the second face.

3483
04:04:07,610 --> 04:04:09,230
I figured it out, though.

3484
04:04:09,790 --> 04:04:13,350
I got faked out.

3485
04:04:13,790 --> 04:04:15,610
This isn't even my final.

3486
04:04:15,750 --> 04:04:16,290
Oh, shit!

3487
04:04:16,790 --> 04:04:19,750
Okay, that was just me fucking up.

3488
04:04:24,310 --> 04:04:24,710
Are you serious?

3489
04:04:24,850 --> 04:04:25,070
Okay.

3490
04:04:28,270 --> 04:04:28,950

3491
04:04:30,150 --> 04:04:34,130
No, no, no, no, no, my bad.

3492
04:04:34,970 --> 04:04:36,890
That was me.

3493
04:04:37,970 --> 04:04:40,590
I'm still, like, thinking about that second phase.

3494
04:04:41,010 --> 04:04:41,510
Oh, my.

3495
04:04:42,290 --> 04:04:42,950
Whoops.

3496
04:04:46,770 --> 04:04:48,590
I'm still thinking about it.

3497
04:04:49,850 --> 04:04:51,170
Are you serious?

3498
04:04:51,370 --> 04:04:52,090
Oh, my gosh.

3499
04:04:53,070 --> 04:04:53,750
I'm fumbling.

3500
04:04:57,070 --> 04:04:59,310
I'm still thinking about it, guys.

3501
04:05:00,150 --> 04:05:02,510
And it's living rent-free in my head.

3502
04:05:04,070 --> 04:05:04,670
Whoa!

3503
04:05:08,360 --> 04:05:09,720
Oh my god.

3504
04:05:10,180 --> 04:05:11,980
I don't know why I'm fumbling now.

3505
04:05:14,160 --> 04:05:14,620
I'm sorry.

3506
04:05:14,780 --> 04:05:15,660
It just lives rent-free.

3507
04:05:18,220 --> 04:05:19,040
Oh no.

3508
04:05:19,480 --> 04:05:20,100
Oh no.

3509
04:05:20,340 --> 04:05:21,500
I might have to reset.

3510
04:05:24,700 --> 04:05:27,140
He's living rent-free in my head.

3511
04:05:27,520 --> 04:05:28,740
I can't help it.

3512
04:05:35,920 --> 04:05:37,840
That's not looking good.

3513
04:05:38,280 --> 04:05:38,680
Oh, so many.

3514
04:05:38,960 --> 04:05:40,000
Thank you for giving me the chance.

3515
04:05:40,160 --> 04:05:41,060
Thank you.

3516
04:05:41,240 --> 04:05:41,460
Okay.

3517
04:05:43,120 --> 04:05:43,800
It's okay.

3518
04:05:44,720 --> 04:05:45,980
It's okay now.

3519
04:05:47,600 --> 04:05:48,360
I'm Zen.

3520
04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:51,900
I'm Zen.

3521
04:05:53,060 --> 04:05:53,560
I'm focused.

3522
04:05:54,540 --> 04:05:55,460
I'm so focused.

3523
04:06:00,980 --> 04:06:01,360
All right.

3524
04:06:02,680 --> 04:06:03,040

You know I don't look up!

3527
04:06:39,780 --> 04:06:40,800
Gamers don't look up!

3528
04:06:44,380 --> 04:06:46,660
You know it was fake news!

3529
04:06:53,610 --> 04:06:53,650
Alright.

3530
04:06:56,490 --> 04:06:57,150
There you go.

3531
04:06:58,830 --> 04:06:59,830
Gamers don't look up.

3532
04:07:00,130 --> 04:07:00,650
Exactly!

3533
04:07:01,870 --> 04:07:04,050
You know I would have done it on purpose!

3534
04:07:08,410 --> 04:07:09,550
Oh, that's close.

3535
04:07:16,450 --> 04:07:19,150
Oh my god, that juke!

3536
04:07:19,610 --> 04:07:21,430
That was a really good juke.

3537
04:07:22,670 --> 04:07:24,170
Are you serious?

3538
04:07:34,240 --> 04:07:35,020
Here we go.

3539
04:07:37,100 --> 04:07:38,480
Oh, shit.

3540
04:07:41,700 --> 04:07:43,440
I got a leaf, though.

3541
04:07:44,120 --> 04:07:45,290
I gotta leave.

3542
04:07:46,820 --> 04:07:48,650
Oh, that was close.

3543
04:07:52,470 --> 04:07:53,450
Okay.

3544
04:07:56,070 --> 04:07:56,870
Nice.

3545
04:07:59,850 --> 04:08:01,730
Oh, I was too short.

3546
04:08:02,710 --> 04:08:03,110
Tricking.

3547
04:08:08,270 --> 04:08:08,610
Okay.

3548
04:08:13,240 --> 04:08:13,730
Oh.

3549
04:08:14,250 --> 04:08:15,230
Oh.

3550
04:08:18,150 --> 04:08:18,710
Oh!

3551
04:08:20,190 --> 04:08:20,670
There you go.

3552
04:08:21,050 --> 04:08:21,570
Nice, I got it.

3553
04:08:24,690 --> 04:08:29,250
Okay, no juke here.

3554
04:08:30,650 --> 04:08:31,910
Are you serious?

3555
04:08:32,230 --> 04:08:33,010
That hits me?

3556
04:08:34,030 --> 04:08:35,310
Okay, that was bullshit.

3557
04:08:36,350 --> 04:08:37,530
It got me on the tip.

3558
04:08:40,370 --> 04:08:41,790
The tip got me.

3559
04:08:45,110 --> 04:08:45,950
Okay, nice.

3560
04:08:45,970 --> 04:08:47,210
That hit.

3561
04:08:49,950 --> 04:08:50,910
Oh my god.

3562
04:08:57,510 --> 04:08:58,930
Oh my god.

3563
04:08:59,130 --> 04:08:59,950
We're such a bitch.

3564
04:09:01,050 --> 04:09:02,390
You're actually such a bitch.

3565
04:09:12,030 --> 04:09:12,590
Too short!

3566
04:09:13,210 --> 04:09:13,810
Short.

3567
04:09:15,970 --> 04:09:16,510
King!

3568
04:09:19,270 --> 04:09:19,990
Nice.

3569
04:09:30,060 --> 04:09:32,780
I really appreciate when he does that.

3570
04:09:42,180 --> 04:09:44,260
I will never stop doing the magic.

3571
04:09:46,960 --> 04:09:47,920
Magic good.

3572
04:09:48,680 --> 04:09:50,180
For only this one moment.

3573
04:09:50,560 --> 04:09:52,160
One time I say magic good.

3574
04:10:00,180 --> 04:10:01,100
Okay.

3575
04:10:04,720 --> 04:10:05,640
Nice.

3576
04:10:06,440 --> 04:10:07,420
No, no, no!

3577
04:10:13,300 --> 04:10:15,020
No heal.

3578
04:10:16,460 --> 04:10:17,300
No heal.

3579
04:10:18,240 --> 04:10:19,500
Oh my god.

3580
04:10:19,620 --> 04:10:22,640
And then he does that instantly.

3581
04:10:24,540 --> 04:10:25,500
That's so fun.

3582
04:10:36,290 --> 04:10:36,690
Oh.

3583
04:10:38,050 --> 04:10:39,090
That hold me.

3584
04:10:40,430 --> 04:10:44,490
I can't believe I accidentally magic.

3585
04:10:45,010 --> 04:10:45,430
Oh!

3586
04:10:47,810 --> 04:10:50,410
Magic good went on my side.

3587
04:10:51,670 --> 04:10:53,710
We will get the true ending.

3588
04:10:55,790 --> 04:10:56,850
I will kill him.

3589
04:11:10,260 --> 04:11:12,340
Oh my god!

3590
04:11:12,680 --> 04:11:13,200
Excuse me?

3591
04:11:14,540 --> 04:11:16,020
I was there first.

3592
04:11:22,060 --> 04:11:22,520
I...

3593
04:11:23,800 --> 04:11:25,220
That's so annoying.

3594
04:11:27,400 --> 04:11:28,720
That's Ashley's so annoying.

3595
04:11:29,800 --> 04:11:30,540
Holy fuck.

3596
04:11:37,620 --> 04:11:38,380
Okay.

3597
04:11:39,380 --> 04:11:39,540
What?

3598
04:11:41,240 --> 04:11:41,760
There you go.

3599
04:11:43,440 --> 04:11:43,840
No!

3600
04:11:43,980 --> 04:11:45,620
No one's seeing their family!

3601
04:11:52,900 --> 04:11:55,620
We will die here!

3602
04:11:56,820 --> 04:11:59,200
I know, right?

3603
04:11:59,300 --> 04:12:00,030
He's out of...

3604
04:12:00,760 --> 04:12:01,400
What?

3605
04:12:14,280 --> 04:12:15,440
That's right.

3606
04:12:16,780 --> 04:12:18,180
No one's seeing their family.

3607
04:12:18,200 --> 04:12:51,510
until I beat until I get the true ending oh my what wait did you guys see that what the fuck happened yeah what the fuck happened he actually cancelled me.

3608
04:12:54,670 --> 04:12:55,750
Wait, he's cheating!

3609
04:12:57,710 --> 04:13:00,710
He actually did an animation cancel.

3610
04:13:02,570 --> 04:13:03,650
That's cheating!

3611
04:13:12,920 --> 04:13:16,320
He plays street fighter.

3612
04:13:17,880 --> 04:13:18,960
God damn, nerd.

3613
04:13:25,960 --> 04:13:27,000
Are you serious?

3614
04:13:29,920 --> 04:13:30,960
There you go.

3615
04:13:37,160 --> 04:13:37,680
Okay.

3616
04:13:42,540 --> 04:13:42,940
Okay.

3617
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:43,300
Okay!

3618
04:13:47,700 --> 04:13:48,500
I don't know how...

3619
04:13:48,500 --> 04:13:49,220
I don't even...

3620
04:13:49,220 --> 04:13:54,460
I have to, like, not touch my controller at all to make sure it doesn't, like, accidentally go up.

3621
04:14:00,520 --> 04:14:01,920
That's the most annoying part.

3622
04:14:04,180 --> 04:14:04,960
Are you serious?

3623
04:14:06,560 --> 04:14:07,540
Oh my god.

3624
04:14:11,080 --> 04:14:13,000
Yeah, I have to, like, let go of my controller.

3625
04:14:21,690 --> 04:14:22,110
Okay.

3626
04:14:25,490 --> 04:14:27,970
Oh my god, he literally did it in front of my face.

3627
04:14:28,670 --> 04:14:29,110
I...

3628
04:14:29,850 --> 04:14:30,370
That's it.

3629
04:14:30,410 --> 04:14:30,750
I'm eating.

3630
04:14:34,770 --> 04:14:37,290
Oh, the fake out.

3631
04:14:38,310 --> 04:14:39,490
The goddamn fake out.

3632
04:14:42,410 --> 04:14:44,030
Okay, I got an extra food.

3633
04:14:48,140 --> 04:14:48,600
Angry eat.

3634
04:14:52,400 --> 04:14:53,480
Oh, whoops.

3635
04:14:53,660 --> 04:14:54,390
I didn't see that.

3636
04:14:58,440 --> 04:14:59,100
Okay.

3637
04:15:02,890 --> 04:15:03,940
All right.

3638
04:15:05,940 --> 04:15:07,780
Oh, now he does this move.

3639
04:15:08,860 --> 04:15:11,440
I swear to God, sometimes he doesn't do this move at all.

3640
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:16,240
Oh, oh, oh, fuck.

3641
04:15:18,220 --> 04:15:20,240
Okay, I can have one extra E.

3642
04:15:21,320 --> 04:15:22,300
Two HP.

3643
04:15:22,900 --> 04:15:23,600
And a dream.

3644
04:15:41,040 --> 04:15:44,920
He just stood there melissingly and did damage to me.

3645
04:15:59,080 --> 04:16:00,200
Phase two.

3646
04:16:00,840 --> 04:16:01,020
Yeah.

3647
04:16:02,480 --> 04:16:04,220
I have made it further.

3648
04:16:06,940 --> 04:16:07,460
Alright.

3649
04:16:07,800 --> 04:16:08,420
It's fine.

3650
04:16:09,680 --> 04:16:12,420
This boss, I'm not, I'm not tilted.

3651
04:16:13,360 --> 04:16:14,580
Because, like, I understand it.

3652
04:16:14,660 --> 04:16:16,420
I'm just, like, I'm just...

3653
04:16:16,420 --> 04:16:20,240
I'm just messing up because of, like, little small mistakes.

3654
04:16:20,640 --> 04:16:21,880
So it's not as bad.

3655
04:16:22,600 --> 04:16:26,720
He's just tedious because there's not a lot of, like, openings to kill him.

3656
04:16:27,320 --> 04:16:28,740
That's the only tedious part.

3657
04:16:31,040 --> 04:16:31,300
Whoops.

3658
04:16:31,540 --> 04:16:32,460
Yeah, like, I should have jumped.

3659
04:16:36,660 --> 04:16:41,120
The only annoying part is just the fact that there's not enough openings to kill him.

3660
04:16:42,500 --> 04:16:43,300
Oh my god, what?

3661
04:16:44,220 --> 04:16:45,320
My polo didn't work there.

3662
04:16:51,330 --> 04:16:51,810
Okay.

3663
04:16:52,670 --> 04:16:54,350
He's not as bad though.

3664
04:16:57,370 --> 04:16:58,050
Gotta lock in.

3665
04:16:58,770 --> 04:17:02,630
The moment I get like a little bit distracted, it like messes with me.

3666
04:17:07,130 --> 04:17:09,290
Oh, he uses one?

3667
04:17:12,910 --> 04:17:13,330
Okay.

3668
04:17:16,910 --> 04:17:19,190
Like, there's just barely any openings.

3669
04:17:20,350 --> 04:17:21,890
And that's, like, the worst part.

3670
04:17:24,310 --> 04:17:24,570
Oh.

3671
04:17:31,350 --> 04:17:32,030
Okay.

3672
04:17:35,410 --> 04:17:36,210
All right.

3673
04:17:39,430 --> 04:17:40,970
Okay, that's two hits.

3674
04:17:41,090 --> 04:17:41,510
That's good.

3675
04:17:44,410 --> 04:17:46,450
I feel like there's barely a time to heal.

3676
04:17:48,370 --> 04:17:51,250
The only time I can heal with is when he does his little thing.

3677
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:01,340
Whoa!

3678
04:18:02,160 --> 04:18:02,640
Whoa!

3679
04:18:03,320 --> 04:18:04,260
Where did he come from?

3680
04:18:06,080 --> 04:18:06,560
Whoa!

3681
04:18:12,460 --> 04:18:13,060
This part?

3682
04:18:14,540 --> 04:18:15,400
Oh, yeah, you're right.

3683
04:18:16,060 --> 04:18:16,820
Okay, now I know.

3684
04:18:17,640 --> 04:18:18,200
Now I know.

3685
04:18:19,340 --> 04:18:21,020
I didn't realize this was enough time.

3686
04:18:25,020 --> 04:18:25,200
Ah!

3687
04:18:25,620 --> 04:18:26,220
Oh, I live.

3688
04:18:29,080 --> 04:18:30,440
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

3689
04:18:33,960 --> 04:18:35,160
I love that.

3690
04:18:35,160 --> 04:18:36,020
I love that.

3691
04:18:36,360 --> 04:18:37,480
Feeding animation.

3692
04:18:37,820 --> 04:18:38,480
It's so silly.

3693
04:18:40,360 --> 04:18:40,840
Yay!

3694
04:18:42,780 --> 04:18:46,200
I'm going to eat in front of you.

3695
04:18:48,340 --> 04:18:49,260
Eat your veggies.

3696
04:18:52,740 --> 04:18:55,600
Oh, that's good.

3697
04:19:03,940 --> 04:19:04,360
Alright.

3698
04:19:06,740 --> 04:19:09,600
Oh, I didn't realize I was full HP.

3699
04:19:10,100 --> 04:19:11,040
I was really hungry.

3700
04:19:11,760 --> 04:19:11,920
Oh.

3701
04:19:15,560 --> 04:19:17,560
I really like my veggies.

3702
04:19:24,880 --> 04:19:27,580
Look, I was just really into my veggies, guys.

3703
04:19:27,760 --> 04:19:28,460
You don't understand.

3704
04:19:29,740 --> 04:19:30,240
Oh, shit.

3705
04:19:31,840 --> 04:19:32,040
Whoops.

3706
04:19:38,060 --> 04:19:40,560
The grub is growing thick and strong.

3707
04:19:41,460 --> 04:19:42,620
I'm a strong grub.

3708
04:19:43,800 --> 04:19:44,320
Well, shit.

3709
04:19:44,460 --> 04:19:44,700
Whoops.

3710
04:19:49,960 --> 04:19:58,700
I just love I love it so much It's such a silly animation Makes me so happy

3711
04:20:08,390 --> 04:20:15,550
Oh, oh I didn't think he was going to do that

3712
04:20:30,390 --> 04:20:31,090
Okay.

3713
04:20:33,890 --> 04:20:34,810
Oh, I'm fine!

3714
04:20:35,310 --> 04:20:35,730
Okay.

3715
04:20:37,690 --> 04:20:38,890
Gotta grow big and hussy!

3716
04:20:43,930 --> 04:20:44,910
There you go.

3717
04:20:46,150 --> 04:20:47,210
Here you go.

3718
04:20:47,210 --> 04:20:48,050
Here you go.

3719
04:20:48,250 --> 04:20:55,150
Stupid man That's not me

3720
04:21:01,910 --> 04:21:08,630
Stupid fucking frog sorcerer I could just use magic there

3721
04:21:14,950 --> 04:21:19,930
Okay That's close That's good.

3722
04:21:20,130 --> 04:21:21,410
I'm glad he used that move.

3723
04:21:23,690 --> 04:21:24,270
Okay.

3724
04:21:26,230 --> 04:21:26,590
Oh.

3725
04:21:34,060 --> 04:21:35,560
Oh my god.

3726
04:21:36,180 --> 04:21:37,780
He's so tedious!

3727
04:21:39,880 --> 04:21:44,000
I feel like it takes 20 years for me to hit him one- Ah!

3728
04:21:46,360 --> 04:21:48,720
For me to hit him one time!

3729
04:21:57,420 --> 04:22:00,840
Oh my god, he actually spawned next to me, thank god.

3730
04:22:06,390 --> 04:22:07,190
Thank god.

3731
04:22:07,930 --> 04:22:08,910
Alright, I'm full HP.

3732
04:22:09,750 --> 04:22:10,410
Alright, it's time.

3733
04:22:12,350 --> 04:22:14,470
It might not be time, I feel like I could fuck it up.

3734
04:22:15,410 --> 04:22:17,350
No, I mean, I could still fuck it up.

3735
04:22:24,190 --> 04:22:25,990
Okay, he should appear here now.

3736
04:22:27,390 --> 04:22:27,910
Whoa!

3737
04:22:31,950 --> 04:22:32,470
Oh.

3738
04:22:33,790 --> 04:22:34,830
It's fine.

3739
04:22:35,790 --> 04:22:36,230
Whoa!

3740
04:22:37,150 --> 04:22:37,670
Whoa!

3741
04:22:41,010 --> 04:22:41,530
Whoa!

3742
04:22:42,190 --> 04:22:42,550
Whoa!

3743
04:22:45,010 --> 04:22:46,790
Oh my god, he's just so diminishing.

3744
04:22:47,150 --> 04:22:48,750
Oh my god, he keeps doing it.

3745
04:22:52,850 --> 04:22:54,090
Okay, there you go.

3746
04:22:56,390 --> 04:22:57,790
Did I do it?

3747
04:22:57,950 --> 04:22:58,550
Wait, what's that?

3748
04:22:58,690 --> 04:22:58,930
He's...

3749
04:22:58,930 --> 04:23:00,970
Oh my god, it was that easy?

3750
04:23:01,890 --> 04:23:02,070
Holy!

3751
04:23:03,250 --> 04:23:04,890
I can't believe it!

3752
04:23:05,350 --> 04:23:07,450
I knew it was that easy!

3753
04:23:07,850 --> 04:23:08,910
Oh my god, okay.

3754
04:23:09,290 --> 04:23:11,330
In my dreams, I could see it.

3755
04:23:11,770 --> 04:23:13,250
The kingdom's salvation.

3756
04:23:13,790 --> 04:23:15,630
The cure for the plague.

3757
04:23:16,070 --> 04:23:19,230
The answer was in the soul that animate our bodies.

3758
04:23:19,670 --> 04:23:21,170
But the king, why?

3759
04:23:21,410 --> 04:23:23,250
He opposed everything I did.

3760
04:23:23,690 --> 04:23:25,710
His jealousy, his madness.

3761
04:23:25,710 --> 04:23:27,090
My saddened gets me.

3762
04:23:27,310 --> 04:23:28,890
He robbed me of my mortality.

3763
04:23:29,510 --> 04:23:31,090
Now the king is king and we're dead.

3764
04:23:31,810 --> 04:23:33,410
But I'll live forever.

3765
04:23:33,770 --> 04:23:35,310
Yeah, in my stomach.

3766
04:23:39,010 --> 04:23:41,050

04:24:33,000 --> 04:24:34,220
I don't have a compass.

3773
04:24:34,800 --> 04:24:36,180
I don't have my map.

3774
04:24:36,980 --> 04:24:38,680

3776
04:24:47,360 --> 04:24:49,240

04:30:30,100 --> 04:30:31,340
Okay, Queen Station.

3866
04:30:31,600 --> 04:30:32,500
Or City of Tears.

3867
04:30:33,300 --> 04:30:35,060
Yeah, City of Tears is the... Wait.

3868
04:30:35,620 --> 04:30:37,020
Yeah, City of Tears is the easiest.

3869
04:30:37,900 --> 04:30:39,160
Am I already in City of Tears?

3870
04:30:39,500 --> 04:30:39,700
No.

3871
04:30:39,840 --> 04:30:40,020
Okay.

3872
04:30:40,280 --> 04:30:40,540

04:30:46,640 --> 04:30:47,720
Oh, it's closed?

3875
04:30:47,960 --> 04:30:48,400
Oh!

3876
04:30:49,940 --> 04:30:51,580
It's a queen station then.

3877
04:31:06,410 --> 04:31:06,850
Alright.

3878
04:31:08,450 --> 04:31:11,310
And then we gotta go right side.

3879
04:31:12,730 --> 04:31:14,490
We'll never open this area.

3880
04:31:14,750 --> 04:31:15,790
They'll look at me.

3881
04:31:23,600 --> 04:31:26,140
No, they said the pathway is apparently closed.

3882
04:31:26,520 --> 04:31:28,340
That's why we're not going to that there.

3883
04:31:32,420 --> 04:31:37,460

She gets this, but not the, it's not that important.

3888
04:32:28,630 --> 04:32:30,350
You don't understand.

3889
04:32:32,590 --> 04:32:36,730
That journal is much more important than the match card.

3890
04:32:39,390 --> 04:32:40,370
Okay, here you go.

3891
04:32:45,210 --> 04:32:45,930
Wow!

Wow!

04:32:52,270 --> 04:32:53,890
I'll kill your child too.

3896
04:32:59,010 --> 04:32:59,230
Ow!

3897
04:32:59,650 --> 04:33:00,370
That's mean.

3898
04:33:01,790 --> 04:33:02,610
How dare you?

3899
04:33:02,690 --> 04:33:03,430
Wait, it's locked.

3900
04:33:04,570 --> 04:33:05,590
Should I go from below?

3901
04:33:09,860 --> 04:33:11,160
That area is locked.

3902
04:33:13,920 --> 04:33:15,760
I will need that bench!

3903
04:33:17,440 --> 04:33:18,640
Okay, it's this way.

3904
04:33:24,120 --> 04:33:24,720
Oh.

3905
04:33:27,180 --> 04:33:29,440
Maybe I do need that bench.

3906
04:33:33,080 --> 04:33:34,260
Okay, guys, we're just looking at this.

3907
04:33:35,740 --> 04:33:38,700
Guys, where's the bench?

3908
04:33:39,460 --> 04:33:40,480
Where is it?

3909
04:33:43,800 --> 04:33:45,160
Oh, shit.

3910
04:33:50,920 --> 04:33:52,000
Up and left.

3911
04:33:52,320 --> 04:33:52,620
Okay.

3912
04:33:53,580 --> 04:33:55,060
Up and left.

3913
04:33:57,200 --> 04:33:57,620
Where?

3914
04:34:03,770 --> 04:34:04,750
Oh, it's cute.

3915
04:34:04,930 --> 04:34:06,590
They're running away because they know I'm a murderer.

3916
04:34:07,670 --> 04:34:08,790
Oh, it's above me?

3917
04:34:11,910 --> 04:34:12,950
Oh, yeah.

3918
04:34:13,830 --> 04:34:14,610
I see.

3919
04:34:15,230 --> 04:34:20,030
Oh, yeah, I gave up on this because I keep falling into the fucking acid.

3920
04:34:20,810 --> 04:34:21,210
Ha ha!

3921
04:34:21,750 --> 04:34:23,570
Not anymore, though!

3922
04:34:29,190 --> 04:34:29,990
Oh, hello.

3923
04:34:32,170 --> 04:34:33,350
Oh my god, who are you?

3924
04:34:34,990 --> 04:34:36,410
Don't try to sneak past me.

3925
04:34:36,510 --> 04:34:37,430
Oh, leg eater.

3926
04:34:37,690 --> 04:34:39,010
I can smell you.

3927
04:34:39,490 --> 04:34:40,950
Do you collect a lot, Gio?

3928
04:34:41,410 --> 04:34:44,430
Give me Gio, and you see something nice.

3929
04:34:44,910 --> 04:34:45,350
Oh, sure.

Let me show you then.

3932

Take a look.

3933
04:34:52,130 --> 04:34:52,970
Do you want them?

3934
04:34:53,250 --> 04:34:56,050
If you really, really want them, I'll trade them for more.

3935
04:34:56,670 --> 04:34:57,150
Gio.

3936
04:34:58,710 --> 04:34:59,070
Sure.

3937
04:35:00,370 --> 04:35:01,330
I mean...

3938
04:35:01,350 --> 04:35:02,230
It doesn't really matter.

3939
04:35:02,390 --> 04:35:03,490
I'll just take it all.

3940
04:35:04,070 --> 04:35:05,010
Run, child.

3941
04:35:05,770 --> 04:35:06,770
Let's buy everything.

3942
04:35:14,520 --> 04:35:14,900
Yay.

3943
04:35:15,780 --> 04:35:16,660
Are they like...

3944
04:35:16,660 --> 04:35:17,060
Wait.

3945
04:35:19,600 --> 04:35:21,140
Are they like in here?

3946
04:35:21,380 --> 04:35:22,180
Oh yeah, nice.

3947
04:35:24,920 --> 04:35:25,840
And we'll break.

3948
04:35:25,980 --> 04:35:27,920
Wait, do I lose these geo forever?

3949
04:35:34,280 --> 04:35:35,540
Like, if I...

3950
04:35:35,540 --> 04:35:36,620
Yeah, do they...

3951
04:35:36,620 --> 04:35:37,860
Are they just like lost?

3952
04:35:38,500 --> 04:35:39,660
Repair them.

3953
04:35:40,360 --> 04:35:41,500
Oh, I see.

3954
04:35:44,740 --> 04:35:45,400
Um.

3955
04:35:46,940 --> 04:35:47,360
Oh.

3956
04:35:47,740 --> 04:35:48,640
Okay, 2-2.

3957
04:35:48,900 --> 04:35:50,880
I feel like I should get the fried strength one.

3958
04:35:51,480 --> 04:35:51,860
Yeah.

3959
04:35:56,200 --> 04:35:57,060
Oh, wait.

3960
04:35:57,240 --> 04:35:58,540
I should...

3961
04:35:59,420 --> 04:36:00,820
I should go back.

3962
04:36:01,300 --> 04:36:02,740
And, um...

3963
04:36:02,740 --> 04:36:05,320
I should go back and do the Geo stuff now.

3964
04:36:06,140 --> 04:36:06,500
Alright.

3965
04:36:06,840 --> 04:36:08,240
We'll grab...

3966
04:36:08,240 --> 04:36:08,720
Okay.

3967
04:36:09,040 --> 04:36:10,620
Do we grab strength?

3968
04:36:10,740 --> 04:36:11,840
are a long nail.

3969
04:36:13,880 --> 04:36:14,780
Uh, we'll do strength.

3970
04:36:15,520 --> 04:36:16,780
Strength and then

3971
04:36:20,160 --> 04:36:20,760
uh...

3972
04:36:20,760 --> 04:36:21,820
And scrub.

3973
04:36:23,420 --> 04:36:24,940
Which, don't use...

3974
04:36:24,940 --> 04:36:27,420
Yeah, but I can't die in the dream, right?

3975
04:36:30,280 --> 04:36:30,880
Yeah.

3976
04:36:38,950 --> 04:36:40,890
Oh, it's a ghost!

3977
04:36:41,190 --> 04:36:41,630
Oh!

3978
04:36:42,290 --> 04:36:43,130
Oh, whatever.

3979
04:36:43,250 --> 04:36:44,610
If I die, he'll repair it.

3980
04:36:45,390 --> 04:36:46,270
That's fine.

3981
04:36:46,830 --> 04:36:48,870
I'll just pay him to repair it.

3982
04:36:49,010 --> 04:36:49,470
It's okay.

3983
04:36:51,090 --> 04:36:51,970
I believe.

3984
04:36:53,750 --> 04:36:54,390
It's okay.

3985
04:36:54,510 --> 04:36:55,590
He can repair it.

3986
04:36:55,910 --> 04:36:56,870
Yeah, it's a ghost.

3987
04:36:57,390 --> 04:36:58,350
Go, go, go, go, go, ghost.

3988
04:36:58,890 --> 04:36:59,170
Wow!

3989
04:36:59,590 --> 04:37:01,410
Oh my, holy shit, he was one shot.

3990
04:37:02,870 --> 04:37:03,670
That's crazy.

3991
04:37:03,830 --> 04:37:04,910
This guy is one shot.

3992
04:37:05,490 --> 04:37:05,850
It's alright.

3993
04:37:05,950 --> 04:37:07,470
I have geo for days.

3994
04:37:07,950 --> 04:37:09,290
Wait, how do I get there again?

3995
04:37:09,990 --> 04:37:10,670
It's down here?

3996
04:37:12,510 --> 04:37:13,490
I actually don't.

3997
04:37:13,590 --> 04:37:14,230
Oh, yeah, it is.

3998
04:37:16,030 --> 04:37:16,790
I have geo for days.

3999
04:37:16,810 --> 04:37:52,050

4004
04:38:44,280 --> 04:38:48,580
I remember those proud lords Were they truly monsters?

4005
04:38:49,160 --> 04:39:20,540

4006

Happy stomach?

4007
04:39:28,420 --> 04:39:30,160
Okay, where do we go now?

4008
04:39:31,500 --> 04:39:33,080
Now go into stags.

4009
04:39:33,600 --> 04:39:35,600
Let me grab one, two, soul.

4010
04:39:39,560 --> 04:39:41,580
Okay, 400, let go.

4011
04:39:43,380 --> 04:39:44,240
I'm trying to remember.

4012
04:39:45,020 --> 04:39:46,000
We're gonna go now.

4013
04:39:47,620 --> 04:39:49,840
Sacrifice your souls for the grub.

4014
04:39:54,820 --> 04:39:55,320
Alright.

4015
04:39:56,900 --> 04:39:58,620
But I forgot how to get back to the bench.

4016
04:39:59,420 --> 04:40:00,840
We don't have a map.

4017
04:40:05,880 --> 04:40:06,820
Okay, this way.

4018
04:40:09,640 --> 04:40:10,920
Actually the heart.

4019
04:40:11,040 --> 04:40:13,540
That fucking rock guy was definitely my filter.

4020
04:40:14,280 --> 04:40:17,980
I had no, like all the other bosses, yeah they were hard.

4021
04:40:18,540 --> 04:40:23,040
But like the fucking, the rock guy was such a hard filter for me.

4022
04:40:26,640 --> 04:40:28,380
Drops it on top of Gourm.

4023
04:40:30,980 --> 04:40:31,420
Okay.

4024
04:40:32,880 --> 04:40:34,740
Soul is full of the Grub God.

4025
04:40:36,300 --> 04:40:39,520
But after I understood the pattern, I like, I got it.

4026
04:40:39,740 --> 04:40:41,120
But like, it was still...

4027
04:40:41,120 --> 04:40:42,680
It took me a while to figure it out.

4028
04:40:43,100 --> 04:40:49,040
It took me a while to figure out that when he jumps back, when he jumps back, he does Fire Strike.

4029
04:40:49,420 --> 04:40:51,580
And I have to yell Fire Strike to understand.

4030
04:40:56,420 --> 04:40:57,280
Like when...

4031
04:40:57,280 --> 04:40:58,220
And I have to yell Fire Strike.

4032
04:40:58,240 --> 04:41:17,440
strike so my brain was like he's gonna fire strike me he's basically not gonna lie he's basically ryan heart i had to re i had to realize i was playing against ryan heart and he was gonna use his fire strike and shatter

04:41:37,150 --> 04:41:38,630
Oh, I keep going back to it.

4036
04:41:42,770 --> 04:41:43,170
Alright.

4037
04:41:47,820 --> 04:41:48,980
Okay, stag nest.

4038
04:41:56,990 --> 04:41:57,550
Now good?

4039
04:41:58,050 --> 04:41:58,310
Okay.

4040
04:41:59,810 --> 04:42:00,490
Try to go this way.

4041
04:42:03,930 --> 04:42:05,670
Go let the collector get me.

4042
04:42:05,950 --> 04:42:07,270
Collector get me guys.

4043
04:42:07,470 --> 04:42:07,790

4044
04:42:08,490 --> 04:42:08,950
No!

4045
04:42:09,590 --> 04:42:10,230
No!

4046
04:42:12,090 --> 04:42:13,890
We'll never get that mask.

4047
04:42:15,190 --> 04:42:16,290
I jump down now.

4048
04:42:16,410 --> 04:42:17,010
Where am I?

4049
04:42:17,170 --> 04:42:17,530
Anyway.

4050
04:42:18,170 --> 04:42:19,370
Where do I go from here?

4051
04:42:20,610 --> 04:42:21,630
Do I have a map for this place?

4052
04:42:21,730 --> 04:42:22,230
Oh, I do.

4053
04:42:22,610 --> 04:42:23,630
Oh, there's a chair there.

4054
04:42:24,290 --> 04:42:25,630
Okay, let's grab that chair.

4055
04:42:32,660 --> 04:42:33,300
What the fuck?

4056
04:42:35,320 --> 04:42:35,760
Strong.

4057
04:42:36,320 --> 04:42:36,960
Oh, my God.

4058
04:42:37,060 --> 04:42:37,860
It's there, isn't he?

4059
04:42:39,460 --> 04:42:40,820
He's there, isn't he?

4060
04:42:45,160 --> 04:42:45,600

Oh, that's my babysitter.

4067
04:43:56,780 --> 04:43:57,820
My babysitter.

4068
04:43:59,460 --> 04:44:04,500
Odex, while looking up or down to perform the cyclone slash or...

4069
04:44:05,440 --> 04:44:06,920
Your form, exquisite.

4070
04:44:07,660 --> 04:44:08,000
Exquisite.

4071
04:44:08,200 --> 04:44:11,620
Now I know my own master felt when he passed down his teachings to us.

4072
04:44:11,780 --> 04:44:16,040
I hope you don't think me too far when I say that I consider you to be much.

4073
04:44:16,360 --> 04:44:19,200
Sir, we only met for like 10 minutes.

4074
04:44:19,740 --> 04:44:25,420
Yes, when I saw you perform my nail art, I felt a bond between us suddenly flashed into existence.

4075
04:44:25,920 --> 04:44:28,000
You honor me beyond my words, my pupil.

4076
04:44:28,500 --> 04:44:29,360
Thank you.

4077
04:44:29,400 --> 04:44:34,780
We only met for like 10 minutes and now he's like...

4078
04:44:36,160 --> 04:44:37,220
Oh, let me hit.

4079
04:44:37,640 --> 04:44:39,020
Dream, my brother.

4080
04:44:39,420 --> 04:44:41,700
How fair are you in that green kingdom of thorns you call home?

4081
04:44:41,780 --> 04:44:43,380
Do you ever close your eyes?

4082
04:44:43,500 --> 04:44:45,540
Remember the time we spent together with Oro and our master.

4083
04:44:46,140 --> 04:44:47,160
I like to think you do.

4084
04:44:47,360 --> 04:44:48,060
Wait, how do I do this?

4085
04:44:53,860 --> 04:44:56,320
My babysitter takes over when I do that.

4086
04:44:58,040 --> 04:44:59,680
Now go up and left.

4087
04:45:00,120 --> 04:45:00,120
Okay.

4088
04:45:01,920 --> 04:45:02,200
Alright.

4089
04:45:04,200 --> 04:45:05,540
Now go up and left.

4090
04:45:07,280 --> 04:45:07,840
This way?

4091
04:45:09,980 --> 04:45:11,120
Where's my map, Shay?

4092
04:45:11,420 --> 04:45:11,760
Okay.

4093
04:45:11,780 --> 04:45:13,160
This way.

4094
04:45:15,160 --> 04:45:15,820
Whoa, what's this?

4095
04:45:15,900 --> 04:45:16,600
Oh, shit!

4096
04:45:16,900 --> 04:45:17,240
Money!

4097
04:45:27,320 --> 04:45:27,880
Yeah?

4098
04:45:29,680 --> 04:45:30,240
Yeah.

4099
04:45:31,160 --> 04:45:31,900
Oh, right?

4100
04:45:35,580 --> 04:45:36,100
Up.

4101
04:45:37,740 --> 04:45:38,660
And right.

4102
04:45:38,960 --> 04:45:40,140
Okay, who the fuck said left?

4103
04:45:40,740 --> 04:45:41,280
Time him up.

4104
04:45:43,640 --> 04:45:44,800
Oh, hey, who's this guy?

4105
04:45:45,600 --> 04:45:46,940
I am Gorb.

4106
04:45:47,480 --> 04:45:48,580
Bow, bow, bow!

4107
04:45:48,840 --> 04:45:49,520
to gore.

4108
04:45:50,040 --> 04:45:51,480
The great mind.

4218
04:57:43,480 --> 04:57:44,760

04:57:46,160 --> 04:57:47,100

Where did she go?

4224
04:58:52,200 --> 04:58:53,340

Okay, she's annoying.

4227
04:59:00,780 --> 04:59:03,280
Because she travels everywhere.

4228
04:59:06,700 --> 04:59:09,200

Okay, she's annoying.

We don't like her.

4232
04:59:18,200 --> 04:59:18,860
There you go.

4233
04:59:21,660 --> 04:59:22,600
Where did she fly to?

4234
04:59:23,460 --> 04:59:28,440
Oh my god.

4235
04:59:28,960 --> 04:59:32,700
There you go.

4236
04:59:33,520 --> 04:59:35,960
She's annoying because of the platforming.

4237
04:59:39,140 --> 04:59:40,380
One by one.

4238
04:59:41,040 --> 05:00:06,860

You shall be at peace in my belly!

4241
05:00:21,100 --> 05:00:24,700
The grub still hungers!

4242
05:00:25,660 --> 05:00:27,300
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

4243
05:00:28,180 --> 05:00:29,200
A word to the right.

4244
05:00:29,620 --> 05:00:30,600
Oh, I was not.

4245
05:00:30,780 --> 05:00:31,920
I didn't know there was a reward.

4246
05:00:35,940 --> 05:00:39,460
A little reward for little old me?

4247
05:00:40,480 --> 05:00:40,860
Beep.

4248
05:00:41,040 --> 05:00:45,720
Oh, how does one get the reward?

4249
05:00:48,320 --> 05:00:48,620
Yeah?

4250
05:00:50,680 --> 05:00:52,620
Oh, oh, it's a mask!

4251
05:00:53,040 --> 05:00:53,440
Yay!

4252
05:00:59,300 --> 05:01:00,720
Can I come out of here?

4253
05:01:01,220 --> 05:01:01,660
Oh, I can't.

4254
05:01:04,020 --> 05:01:04,880
Oh, I can't.

4255
05:01:06,020 --> 05:01:06,360
Okay.

4256
05:01:07,160 --> 05:01:07,740
Yay!

4257
05:01:12,220 --> 05:01:15,680
Okay, maybe we need to grab the mask shard now.

4258
05:01:15,700 --> 05:01:16,840
Wait, what's over here, though?

4259
05:01:18,320 --> 05:01:20,080
Is it just another way to get the reward?

4260
05:01:20,920 --> 05:01:21,840
Oh, yeah, it is.

4261
05:01:22,180 --> 05:01:23,240
Because that's where I killed her.

4262
05:01:24,020 --> 05:01:25,020
Alright, now we go.

4263
05:01:26,960 --> 05:01:28,360
Go to Queen Station?

4264
05:01:28,740 --> 05:01:31,620
Okay, now we can go to Queen Station.

4265
05:01:34,700 --> 05:01:37,100
Now we'll actually...

4266
05:01:37,100 --> 05:01:37,880
Oh, shit.

4267
05:01:40,840 --> 05:01:42,200
We'll actually grab it.

4268
05:01:47,470 --> 05:01:49,630
I like how someone's like, Lost King.

4269
05:01:49,630 --> 05:01:53,330
Guys, I killed Lost King two parts ago.

4270
05:01:57,230 --> 05:01:58,970
he's already dead.

4271
05:02:01,590 --> 05:02:06,950
He's been dead for like 10 plus hours ago.

4272
05:02:07,810 --> 05:02:08,950
We've killed him.

4273
05:02:09,350 --> 05:02:11,110
We can't kill him harder.

4274
05:02:12,730 --> 05:02:14,530
Just do it again.

4275
05:02:16,070 --> 05:02:18,970
We can't kill him even harder, guys.

4276
05:02:18,990 --> 05:02:20,870
I would if I could.

4277
05:02:28,130 --> 05:02:28,870
Okay, we gotta go.

4278
05:02:28,890 --> 05:02:29,870
Okay, we gotta go this way.

4279
05:02:39,600 --> 05:02:40,280
This is...

4280
05:02:40,280 --> 05:02:40,980
Oh my god.

4281
05:02:41,120 --> 05:02:42,100
He fucking blocked.

4282
05:02:42,200 --> 05:02:42,800
Oh my god.

4283
05:02:42,940 --> 05:02:43,820
They're all blocking me.

4284
05:02:50,120 --> 05:02:51,500
Kill them squared.

4285
05:02:57,010 --> 05:02:58,010
Okay, I want to make sure.

4286
05:02:58,070 --> 05:03:00,730
Okay, I just want to make sure I didn't accidentally equip the strength one.

4287
05:03:03,630 --> 05:03:04,890
No, I haven't done the B-Hive.

4288
05:03:05,750 --> 05:03:08,970
That after I get the dream thing.

4289
05:03:13,230 --> 05:03:13,250
Yeah.

4290
05:03:14,030 --> 05:03:14,910
Oh, I went the wrong way.

4291
05:03:15,050 --> 05:03:15,510
It's this way.

4292
05:03:22,600 --> 05:03:23,340
Oh, whoops.

4293
05:03:25,000 --> 05:03:26,020
Is this how to get back?

4294
05:03:27,480 --> 05:03:28,100
Okay, nice.

4295
05:03:30,860 --> 05:03:31,840
Oh, it's too late.

4296
05:03:31,920 --> 05:03:32,940
We're not going right.

4297
05:03:38,160 --> 05:03:42,060
Oh, you mean this guy for the nail art.

4298
05:03:42,080 --> 05:03:44,200
Yeah, but will I use it?

4299
05:03:45,980 --> 05:03:47,140
Alright, fine.

4300
05:03:47,340 --> 05:03:48,020
I'll do it.

4301
05:03:48,080 --> 05:03:48,920
Just because we're there.

4302
05:03:49,180 --> 05:03:51,280
Just because he's there anyway, I'll do it.

4303
05:03:57,530 --> 05:03:58,570
Oh, it's parkour.

4304
05:03:58,990 --> 05:03:59,350
Okay.

4305
05:04:00,830 --> 05:04:02,070
Why the fuck is it?

4306
05:04:02,930 --> 05:04:06,350
Oh my god, I keep thinking that I can...

4307
05:04:06,350 --> 05:04:10,470
I don't know why I thought that I could use that as a spike thing.

4308
05:04:22,080 --> 05:04:22,980
Oh, fuck!

4309
05:04:23,100 --> 05:04:25,900
I was trying to figure out where to go after.

4310
05:04:41,810 --> 05:04:42,790
God, I hate that.

4311
05:04:50,000 --> 05:04:50,800
Wait, why?

4312
05:04:51,320 --> 05:04:51,800
Oh!

4313
05:04:52,060 --> 05:04:53,620
Okay, I get it.

4314
05:04:58,900 --> 05:04:59,320
Alright.

4315
05:05:00,420 --> 05:05:01,460
That's over there.

4316
05:05:03,360 --> 05:05:03,840
Okay.

4317
05:05:05,020 --> 05:05:06,480
That's over here, though.

4318
05:05:08,120 --> 05:05:09,760
Oh, that's for skipping it.

4319
05:05:10,540 --> 05:05:11,000
Okay.

4320
05:05:13,140 --> 05:05:30,280
We're just to know that our guy where is he where is he I did his stupid test there he is

4321
05:05:33,470 --> 05:05:59,470
hello a visitor why have you crept in here little grub perhaps like me y'all taste for discovering new things I am sure and in previous life I was a nail master yes The only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and honoring my skills over now.

4322
05:06:00,370 --> 05:06:04,810
I imagine it was my one calling in life, but the feeling faded over time.

4323
05:06:05,210 --> 05:06:05,790
What did I do?

4324
05:06:06,810 --> 05:06:08,870
It was like, what the fuck?

4325
05:06:09,290 --> 05:06:10,370
I don't know what I did.

4326
05:06:11,970 --> 05:06:17,170
Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul and compels me forward.

4327
05:06:18,250 --> 05:06:22,950
That's why I spend my time here, secluded, trying to master the art of my life.

4328
05:06:22,970 --> 05:06:49,010
creation painting is sculpting these things bring a different kind of pleasure you pixel perfect of a thorn what like a tarn he don't seem very moved by what i said but shield and nail master you're looking for they come to learn a nail art i'll teach you if you insist okay

4329
05:06:59,190 --> 05:07:00,310
Learn the...

4330
05:07:00,310 --> 05:07:00,830
Yay!

4331
05:07:01,570 --> 05:07:02,970
I'm learning how to pay!

4332
05:07:07,790 --> 05:07:09,710
Got a great stash.

4333
05:07:13,890 --> 05:07:16,730
Oh, okay, so now, okay, this one is like easier.

4334
05:07:17,210 --> 05:07:19,130
So, my work doesn't move you.

4335
05:07:19,590 --> 05:07:20,790
The wielding of a nail.

4336
05:07:21,070 --> 05:07:22,390
The wielding of a brush.

4337
05:07:23,090 --> 05:07:24,930
These things are not so different.

4338
05:07:25,010 --> 05:07:28,510
We cut into the world so that we can peer deeper inside.

4339
05:07:29,150 --> 05:07:31,550
For now, though, I have nothing more to teach you.

4340
05:07:31,910 --> 05:07:34,510
Your path forward, only you can see it.

4341
05:07:34,850 --> 05:07:35,390
Good luck.

4342
05:07:36,190 --> 05:07:36,430
Yeah.

4343
05:07:37,330 --> 05:07:39,330
I don't even know exactly what I did.

4344
05:07:39,710 --> 05:07:40,950
Made a Rugo ungo...

4345
05:07:40,950 --> 05:07:41,730
What, this?

4346
05:07:42,290 --> 05:07:44,310
Am I not supposed to jump over it?

4347
05:08:00,040 --> 05:08:01,760
Do it again!

4348
05:08:03,080 --> 05:08:04,320
No, that's okay.

4349
05:08:06,280 --> 05:08:06,500
No.

4350
05:08:08,800 --> 05:08:10,140
I don't need to.

4351
05:08:11,060 --> 05:08:12,040
I don't need to.

4352
05:08:12,660 --> 05:08:14,940
I'm not the one that couldn't do it.

4353
05:08:21,830 --> 05:08:23,030
Just rewind.

4354
05:08:23,830 --> 05:08:25,570
You want to see it.

4355
05:08:26,230 --> 05:08:27,430
I think I won't.

4356
05:08:34,000 --> 05:08:35,660
Okay, so that's what I got.

4357
05:08:36,200 --> 05:08:37,360
Lucky frog.

4358
05:08:39,100 --> 05:08:43,080
That jump is almost impossible there, dude.

4359
05:08:43,920 --> 05:08:46,820
That's supposed to be hard?

4360
05:08:56,340 --> 05:08:59,320
It's almost TAS only?

4361
05:08:59,480 --> 05:09:00,440
Wait, what's TAS?

4362
05:09:02,920 --> 05:09:04,760
That's my Oshi.

4363
05:09:11,160 --> 05:09:11,700
Here you go.

4364
05:09:16,920 --> 05:09:19,400
Oh, tool-assisted speedrun?

4365
05:09:19,520 --> 05:09:20,480
Wait, what does that mean?

4366
05:09:21,720 --> 05:09:23,880
What does tool-assisted speedrun mean?

4367
05:09:35,870 --> 05:09:39,590
Oh, they have to use a computer program to do it?

4368
05:09:40,870 --> 05:09:42,030
Fucking not gamer.

4369
05:09:43,650 --> 05:09:44,450
Fucking weak.

4370
05:09:44,910 --> 05:09:48,530
Imagine needing to use a tool to do a pixel-perfect spike jump.

4371
05:09:49,150 --> 05:09:50,470
That couldn't be me.

4372
05:10:02,650 --> 05:10:04,570
Go to the lake up.

4373
05:10:04,710 --> 05:10:05,630
How do I get to the lake?

4374
05:10:09,090 --> 05:10:10,550
Just, how's that seed run?

4375
05:10:10,630 --> 05:10:12,290
Just get good, exactly.

4376
05:10:12,810 --> 05:10:13,950
Oh, that's right.

4377
05:10:14,530 --> 05:10:15,550
You know what's up.

4378
05:10:16,770 --> 05:10:18,890
Do it five times.

4379
05:10:23,730 --> 05:10:24,890
King Station has the last...

4380
05:10:24,890 --> 05:10:26,050
Okay, but...

4381
05:10:26,910 --> 05:10:38,570

4382
05:10:43,200 --> 05:10:52,060

4383
05:10:58,710 --> 05:11:05,590
oh wait we had

4384
05:11:09,110 --> 05:11:10,970
Stop taking her there!

4385
05:11:11,210 --> 05:11:12,510
Didn't I already do Lake of Un?

4386
05:11:13,430 --> 05:11:15,270
I already did this area.

4387
05:11:15,730 --> 05:11:16,510
That's the...

4388
05:11:18,750 --> 05:11:20,230
Do I not do that?

4389
05:11:29,990 --> 05:11:30,490
Oh!

4390
05:11:33,430 --> 05:11:34,410
Okay, I see.

4391
05:11:34,910 --> 05:11:35,930
But I don't do it.

4392
05:11:37,830 --> 05:11:39,450
I didn't swim in it.

4393
05:11:40,610 --> 05:11:41,370
I see.

4394
05:11:41,810 --> 05:11:42,670
It's here, right?

4395
05:11:47,030 --> 05:11:47,950
Oh, yeah!

4396
05:11:48,030 --> 05:11:49,310
I remember now.

4397
05:11:51,110 --> 05:11:52,590
I remember here.

4398
05:11:54,630 --> 05:11:55,890
Where's the path?

4399
05:12:06,660 --> 05:12:08,520
Okay, now I go this way.

4400
05:12:09,220 --> 05:12:09,680
I swim.

4401
05:12:10,620 --> 05:12:11,680
Swim, swim.

4402
05:12:19,590 --> 05:12:20,570
Okay, down I'll go.

4403
05:12:21,550 --> 05:12:21,850
Swim, swim.

4404
05:12:23,210 --> 05:12:24,410
Down, I- Oh, wait.

4405
05:12:25,090 --> 05:12:25,870
Still down.

4406
05:12:26,590 --> 05:12:27,530
Still down.

4407
05:12:29,650 --> 05:12:31,590
Oh my god, how much down?

4408
05:12:31,610 --> 05:12:33,770
Still down?

4409
05:12:38,150 --> 05:12:38,610
What?

4410
05:12:43,440 --> 05:12:44,820
Where is he?

4411
05:12:46,560 --> 05:12:47,900
Splish flash.

4412
05:12:49,040 --> 05:12:50,620
Oh, stay down there?

4413
05:12:51,300 --> 05:12:51,660
Hello.

4414
05:12:53,780 --> 05:12:54,940
Oh, there it is.

4415
05:12:57,080 --> 05:12:58,120
Shape of own.

4416
05:13:00,440 --> 05:13:01,700
Oh, I missed him.

4417
05:13:06,940 --> 05:13:10,620
Guess we'll never, I'll never know what he looked like.

4418
05:13:10,980 --> 05:13:13,400
I, how was I supposed to know?

4419
05:13:13,960 --> 05:13:16,180
I just, I stopped halfway.

4420
05:13:16,480 --> 05:13:17,220
I just can't.

4421
05:13:17,680 --> 05:13:19,920
Oh, it's been too bad.

4422
05:13:20,220 --> 05:13:20,800
Too late.

4423
05:13:21,240 --> 05:13:23,840
I, he was a giant slug.

4424
05:13:24,360 --> 05:13:26,120
How is he so fast?

4425
05:13:29,740 --> 05:13:30,380
Oops.

4426
05:13:34,400 --> 05:13:36,160
I was like, where is he?

4427
05:13:36,360 --> 05:13:36,920
Where is he?

4428
05:13:36,940 --> 05:13:38,680
This guy I'm supposed to see.

4429
05:13:38,880 --> 05:13:40,220
I'm so confused.

4430
05:13:44,300 --> 05:13:46,240
I'm so confused.

4431
05:13:54,600 --> 05:13:57,280
How did you expect me not to move?

4432
05:13:57,800 --> 05:14:00,920
I saw a pathway, so I went for the path.

4433
05:14:01,260 --> 05:14:02,420
I was like, oh, did I go here?

4434
05:14:03,460 --> 05:14:05,400
Run, dead star.

4435
05:14:05,820 --> 05:14:05,960
Over.

4436
05:14:07,440 --> 05:14:16,080
Yeah, clearly it can't be that important if you only have two seconds of cut scenes if you think about it

4437
05:14:22,770 --> 05:14:32,990

Oops.

Okay, this is dumb.

05:15:06,470 --> 05:15:14,010
No, I saw a clip of this person doing this for like 20 years.

4446
05:15:14,430 --> 05:15:15,470
No, it's gonna be me.

4447
05:15:15,570 --> 05:15:16,570
It's gonna be me.

4448
05:15:18,170 --> 05:15:19,510
I'm gonna be her.

4449
05:15:19,910 --> 05:15:21,030
This person on 20 years.

Okay.

4455
05:16:26,210 --> 05:16:26,770
King station.

4456
05:16:27,510 --> 05:16:31,750
I didn't want to be a Twitter clip again of that of me trying to do a parkour.

4457
05:16:32,650 --> 05:16:33,470
I was scared.

4458
05:16:33,570 --> 05:16:34,130
I was scared.

4459
05:16:38,210 --> 05:16:39,630
Oh, kingdom's edge.

4460
05:16:39,830 --> 05:16:41,090
There's two kings!

4461
05:16:41,710 --> 05:16:44,670
You can't expect me to realize which king it was.

4462
05:16:45,470 --> 05:16:46,750
Wait, I don't have kingdom's edge.

4463
05:16:49,010 --> 05:16:51,150
Where do I go for kingdom's edge?

4464
05:16:52,610 --> 05:16:53,970
Yeah, no stack for edge.

4465
05:16:58,780 --> 05:16:58,800
Okay.

4466
05:17:04,950 --> 05:17:06,230
How do I get there?

4467
05:17:07,750 --> 05:17:09,070
Oh, it's up.

4468
05:17:10,270 --> 05:17:10,610
Okay.

4469
05:17:11,270 --> 05:17:11,530
Up.

4470
05:17:13,730 --> 05:17:14,130
Well.

4471
05:17:15,150 --> 05:17:15,830
Okay, how...

4472
05:17:15,830 --> 05:17:17,750
Is there a bench in...

4473
05:17:17,750 --> 05:17:19,530
Is there a bench, though?

4474
05:17:21,410 --> 05:17:23,530
Is there a bench at Kingdom's Edge?

4475
05:17:25,410 --> 05:17:25,850
Yes?

4476
05:17:26,010 --> 05:17:26,290
Okay.

4477
05:17:26,810 --> 05:17:27,410
That's good.

4478
05:17:28,270 --> 05:17:29,830
He's gotta know.

4479
05:17:31,850 --> 05:17:33,630
Holy shit, she just slammed into me.

4480
05:17:36,630 --> 05:17:37,650
Wait, down?

4481
05:17:39,790 --> 05:17:41,390
Wait, Kingdom's Edge is over here.

4482
05:17:44,110 --> 05:17:46,610
Oh, there's another area to Kingdom's Edge.

4483
05:17:46,750 --> 05:17:46,990
Okay.

4484
05:17:48,330 --> 05:17:49,930
I didn't see the down part.

4485
05:17:49,990 --> 05:17:50,550
I didn't read.

4486
05:17:51,870 --> 05:17:53,190
Alright, there's another one here.

4487
05:18:00,810 --> 05:18:02,630
Oh my god, it's this area.

4488
05:18:02,890 --> 05:18:03,730
I remember now.

4489
05:18:07,020 --> 05:18:07,900
Are you serious?

4490
05:18:08,240 --> 05:18:08,940
That hit me?

4491
05:18:11,600 --> 05:18:14,180
Jesus Christ, the range for that explosion.

4492
05:18:16,580 --> 05:18:16,880
Yeah?

4493
05:18:18,680 --> 05:18:19,700
Where do we go?

4494
05:18:26,820 --> 05:18:28,600
Alright, let's open the map.

4495
05:18:29,700 --> 05:18:30,680
Alright, here we go.

4496
05:18:30,880 --> 05:18:31,470
Where is it?

4497
05:18:33,620 --> 05:18:34,160
Right?

4498
05:18:34,440 --> 05:18:35,720
Okay, do we go down?

4499
05:18:37,540 --> 05:18:38,640
Where is it?

4500
05:18:38,900 --> 05:18:39,360
Which bench?

4501
05:18:39,980 --> 05:18:42,400
This bench or this bench?

4502
05:18:48,060 --> 05:18:50,260
Left of cast off shell?

4503
05:18:52,120 --> 05:18:53,020
Go to the bench.

4504
05:18:53,200 --> 05:18:54,040
Oh, this bench?

4505
05:18:55,920 --> 05:18:56,860
This one?

4506
05:18:56,940 --> 05:18:58,660
Okay, one or two?

4507
05:18:59,880 --> 05:19:01,040
I ran out of pins.

4508
05:19:02,760 --> 05:19:03,640
One or two?

4509
05:19:08,240 --> 05:19:08,920
Yeah.

4510
05:19:09,560 --> 05:19:09,900
Okay.

4511
05:19:10,840 --> 05:19:11,680
Oh, is it here?

4512
05:19:12,180 --> 05:19:13,000
Wait, is it this?

4513
05:19:14,120 --> 05:19:15,160
Is it this?

4514
05:19:19,920 --> 05:19:21,300
Yes, okay.

4515
05:19:24,550 --> 05:19:26,310
I keep forgetting about the falling bodies.

4516
05:19:27,270 --> 05:19:27,970
How are there still bodies?

4517
05:19:28,030 --> 05:19:28,650
Oh, is it...

4518
05:19:28,650 --> 05:19:31,410
They're all from the Colosseum, right?

4519
05:19:33,250 --> 05:19:36,130
I was gonna say, how are there still falling bodies?

4520
05:19:41,000 --> 05:19:41,960
Okay, let's see.

4521
05:19:43,980 --> 05:19:45,440
It's raining bugs.

4522
05:19:45,840 --> 05:19:48,060
Okay, let's grab the bench first before we get there.

4523
05:19:52,750 --> 05:19:54,030
Okay, it's this way.

4524
05:19:57,230 --> 05:19:57,710
I forgot.

4525
05:19:57,830 --> 05:20:01,350
This is the area where I hate the most with the stupid jumping bugs.

4526
05:20:09,280 --> 05:20:09,300
Alright.

4527
05:20:09,860 --> 05:20:11,580
We get rid of this, this.

4528
05:20:15,940 --> 05:20:16,860
Oh yeah, what is this?

4529
05:20:17,300 --> 05:20:19,200
The bear would take on and can move freely.

4530
05:20:19,620 --> 05:20:23,400
Well, the bear would take and can move freely to...

4531
05:20:23,400 --> 05:20:24,340
Wait, what the fuck?

4532
05:20:24,540 --> 05:20:25,220
What does this do?

4533
05:20:27,220 --> 05:20:27,660
Ah!

4534
05:20:31,120 --> 05:20:33,080
Okay, we'll get that later.

4535
05:20:36,060 --> 05:20:39,460
Okay, that's pretty fucking stupid, but...

4536
05:20:39,460 --> 05:20:44,520
I don't know if I need that for the ghost, though.

4537
05:20:44,820 --> 05:20:45,620
I don't know.

4538
05:20:46,100 --> 05:20:48,340
I don't think I need that for the ghost chat.

4539
05:20:49,180 --> 05:20:50,000
Look at the string.

4540
05:20:50,780 --> 05:20:53,000
Parablet pulled their shell.

4541
05:20:53,600 --> 05:20:56,020
Okay, yeah, we don't need that yet.

4542
05:20:57,800 --> 05:20:58,500

Oh, my God.

05:22:35,860 --> 05:22:37,380
There's a lot of parkour platforms.

4558
05:22:39,160 --> 05:22:44,180
You've come a long way just to die here at the edge of the world?

4559
05:22:45,240 --> 05:22:47,020

05:24:41,300 --> 05:24:42,040
Now I know.

4578
05:24:43,300 --> 05:24:43,980
Maybe you're right.

4579
05:24:44,100 --> 05:24:45,180
Maybe I need...

4580
05:24:45,740 --> 05:24:47,420

4581
05:24:47,880 --> 05:24:48,160
Okay.

No, I fucked up because, like, I also wasn't, like, familiar.

4588
05:25:09,390 --> 05:25:12,290
Like, I didn't know when to heal for that one.

4589
05:25:12,910 --> 05:25:13,350
Oh, shit.

4590
05:25:13,870 --> 05:25:13,870

Wee!

4596
05:25:27,610 --> 05:25:28,850

4597
05:25:30,950 --> 05:25:32,870
so I don't have to deal with.

4598
05:25:34,010 --> 05:25:34,790

Okay.

4612
05:26:15,780 --> 05:26:18,120

4613
05:26:18,700 --> 05:26:19,320

4614
05:26:20,180 --> 05:26:21,340

05:26:26,020 --> 05:26:27,500
That's so dumb.

4617
05:26:30,240 --> 05:26:31,720
I'm okay with that.

4618
05:26:31,960 --> 05:26:32,720
No!

4619
05:26:33,340 --> 05:26:34,100
No!

4620
05:26:35,280 --> 05:26:36,200
Let me eat!

4621
05:26:37,180 --> 05:26:41,280

Hungry grub!

4626
05:27:07,660 --> 05:27:08,520
Oh shit.

4627
05:27:09,880 --> 05:27:10,040
Okay.

4628
05:27:14,030 --> 05:27:15,090
Are you serious?

4629
05:27:15,390 --> 05:27:16,590
Oh, he came all the way there.

4630
05:27:16,670 --> 05:27:17,730
I didn't see him.

4631
05:27:22,030 --> 05:27:23,390
Okay, I need to be able to hit him.

4632
05:27:25,010 --> 05:27:26,110
He's so fast.

4633
05:27:26,410 --> 05:27:26,730
Whoa!

4634
05:27:27,310 --> 05:27:27,590
Whoa!

4635
05:27:28,550 --> 05:27:28,850
Shit!

4636
05:27:29,730 --> 05:27:30,070
Whoops.

4637
05:27:32,690 --> 05:27:32,950
Oh, no!

4638
05:27:36,470 --> 05:27:36,930
Ah!

4639
05:27:40,250 --> 05:27:41,130
Oh, shit.

4640
05:27:42,410 --> 05:27:43,270
There we go.

4641
05:27:45,530 --> 05:27:45,830
Come.

4642
05:27:50,370 --> 05:27:52,950
Never have I been defeated in combat.

4643
05:27:53,670 --> 05:27:56,530
I can see myself there, still sleeping.

4644
05:27:57,290 --> 05:27:58,610
How long have I been hitting here?

4645
05:27:59,370 --> 05:28:04,110
Here at the edge of the world, no one could find me, except you.

4646
05:28:05,410 --> 05:28:11,410
Warriors, knights, kings, every time myself, even time myself, they have no power with me.

4647
05:28:11,810 --> 05:28:12,590
Only you.

4648
05:28:13,290 --> 05:28:14,090
You are the darkness.

4649
05:28:14,590 --> 05:28:14,970
Come!

4650
05:28:14,970 --> 05:28:17,110
To consume me.

4651
05:28:18,010 --> 05:28:18,610
That's right.

4652
05:28:19,630 --> 05:28:26,050
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

4653
05:28:27,590 --> 05:28:29,310
Grub's still hungry.

4654
05:28:30,030 --> 05:28:33,750
If he's so good, why is he dead?

4655
05:28:33,850 --> 05:28:35,030
That's what I'm saying.

4656
05:28:36,450 --> 05:28:37,370
Get in the belly.

4657
05:28:38,410 --> 05:28:39,410
Grub's still hungry.

4658
05:28:42,650 --> 05:28:43,010
Yeah.

4659
05:28:43,950 --> 05:28:44,430
Alright.

4660
05:28:47,950 --> 05:28:48,890
Nice, 1800.

4661
05:28:49,370 --> 05:28:50,230
Thank fucking God.

4662
05:28:51,190 --> 05:28:52,230
We can go back now.

4663
05:28:53,430 --> 05:28:56,070
I need to grab my map because I don't know how to get out of here.

4664
05:28:56,690 --> 05:28:57,290
What about it?

4665
05:28:57,510 --> 05:28:58,390
I actually don't.

4666
05:28:58,950 --> 05:29:00,970
So, like, we really...

4667
05:29:01,790 --> 05:29:04,850
If I don't have my map, I will not know how to get up.

4668
05:29:07,410 --> 05:29:08,910
I can't believe all that.

4669
05:29:09,090 --> 05:29:11,510
Just so we still have the parkour.

4670
05:29:15,110 --> 05:29:16,050
Guys, give me a sec.

4671
05:29:16,230 --> 05:29:18,170
I'm trying to figure out how do I...

4672
05:29:18,170 --> 05:29:20,190
Wait, where... Where's the bench?

4673
05:29:20,590 --> 05:29:24,010
Oh, shit.

4674
05:29:24,570 --> 05:29:25,610
I hate these guys.

4675
05:29:31,260 --> 05:29:31,780
Up and right.

4676
05:29:32,020 --> 05:29:32,280
Okay.

4677
05:29:32,620 --> 05:29:34,260
I legitimately don't remember how to get to there.

4678
05:29:36,140 --> 05:29:37,120
There you go.

4679
05:29:43,900 --> 05:29:44,200
Okay.

4680
05:29:47,020 --> 05:29:47,720
Child, thank you.

4681
05:29:47,820 --> 05:29:48,960
Child, thank you for the super chat.

4682
05:29:49,020 --> 05:29:49,540
Thank you, thank you.

4683
05:29:49,540 --> 05:29:50,820
Try Defender's Crest.

4684
05:29:51,140 --> 05:29:51,780
A glowing womb.

4685
05:29:51,900 --> 05:29:52,560
Next, we're funny.

4686
05:29:52,800 --> 05:29:56,260
We're cute to sit on the bench after spawning some flies and wait.

4687
05:29:57,180 --> 05:29:57,480
Uh, thank you.

4688
05:29:57,580 --> 05:29:58,300
Thank you.

4689
05:29:58,420 --> 05:29:58,940
Thank you.

4690
05:29:59,280 --> 05:29:59,780
Wait, what?

4691
05:30:00,260 --> 05:30:03,060
This plus what?

4692
05:30:03,960 --> 05:30:06,720
Loading womb and defenders crest.

4693
05:30:08,580 --> 05:30:10,040
What's gonna happen?

4694
05:30:11,080 --> 05:30:11,300
Oh!

4695
05:30:12,540 --> 05:30:14,540
Oh, it's music notes.

4696
05:30:14,880 --> 05:30:15,180

05:30:48,960 --> 05:30:50,700

Okay.

4714
05:31:31,000 --> 05:31:31,440
Grubs.

4715
05:31:31,660 --> 05:31:31,880
I don't know.

4716
05:31:31,980 --> 05:31:32,160
Okay.

4717
05:31:33,140 --> 05:31:33,600

4718
05:31:33,980 --> 05:31:34,380

4719
05:31:35,340 --> 05:31:35,660

05:31:39,320 --> 05:31:39,720
There we go.

4722
05:31:40,340 --> 05:31:40,740
All right.

4723
05:31:40,980 --> 05:31:41,460
Let's.

4724
05:31:41,780 --> 05:31:43,780
It is time to go back to sag.

4725
05:31:51,280 --> 05:31:52,040
Oh, shit.

4726
05:31:52,120 --> 05:31:52,780
I didn't even see that.

4727
05:31:54,040 --> 05:31:54,360
All right.

4728
05:31:54,720 --> 05:31:55,720
Resting grounds.

4729
05:31:55,940 --> 05:31:56,380
How do we...

4730
05:31:56,400 --> 05:31:57,520
go to get the hive.

4731
05:31:57,900 --> 05:32:00,460
We might as well grab the hive charm too to make it easier.

4732
05:32:01,360 --> 05:32:03,880
I am not like trying to do parkour in one run.

4733
05:32:04,680 --> 05:32:06,560
I'd rather make it easier.

4734
05:32:07,680 --> 05:32:08,140
Uh, oops.

4735
05:32:08,720 --> 05:32:09,880
Let's try and look at my map.

4736
05:32:12,620 --> 05:32:13,700
Isn't it deepness?

4737
05:32:17,500 --> 05:32:17,980
Okay.

4738
05:32:26,560 --> 05:32:28,420
All right, let's go here.

4739
05:32:32,740 --> 05:32:34,480
The hive is in this area.

4740
05:32:34,620 --> 05:32:35,660
Oh, how do I get there?

4741
05:32:36,840 --> 05:32:38,580
I have the tram pass.

4742
05:32:40,240 --> 05:32:41,160
God, I hate these guys.

4743
05:32:41,280 --> 05:32:42,740
I hate these guys so much.

4744
05:32:48,190 --> 05:32:48,910
Bottom left.

4745
05:32:49,010 --> 05:32:50,010
Alright, I'm pulling up the map.

4746
05:32:50,990 --> 05:32:51,510
Where do we go?

4747
05:32:51,650 --> 05:32:51,930
Yeah?

4748
05:32:52,210 --> 05:32:52,810
Is it this?

4749
05:32:53,070 --> 05:32:53,530
Oh, shit.

4750
05:32:54,250 --> 05:32:56,190
Let me get rid of all my markers.

4751
05:32:57,710 --> 05:32:58,410
Is it here?

4752
05:33:14,160 --> 05:33:15,980
Oh, stacked a hidden station.

4753
05:33:17,020 --> 05:33:17,260
Oh.

4754
05:33:18,080 --> 05:33:19,040
Apparently I can't.

4755
05:33:20,000 --> 05:33:21,680
Okay, I have to take the tram first.

4756
05:33:21,800 --> 05:33:22,480
Okay, we got algo.

4757
05:33:22,540 --> 05:33:23,480
Okay, let's go back to...

4758
05:33:24,300 --> 05:33:25,980
Okay, we can't do it yet.

4759
05:33:26,700 --> 05:33:26,700
Okay.

4760
05:33:34,330 --> 05:33:36,370
Okay, ancient bastion time.

4761
05:33:37,050 --> 05:33:38,550
All right, before we do that, let's grab.

4762
05:33:40,210 --> 05:33:44,050
Um, I don't remember how- which way I went to for the city.

4763
05:33:44,570 --> 05:33:44,810
Here?

4764
05:33:44,990 --> 05:33:45,610
Yeah, it is.

4765
05:33:48,900 --> 05:33:50,400
Fucking stupid homing shit.

4766
05:33:54,040 --> 05:33:56,420
Okay, I gotta- oh, I can't even heal here.

05:34:40,900 --> 05:34:41,900
And then...

05:34:41,900 --> 05:34:42,280
Yay!

4772
05:34:49,460 --> 05:34:50,540
Go this way.

4773
05:34:50,840 --> 05:34:52,320
We finally have 1800.

4774
05:34:53,320 --> 05:34:54,340
It took us a while.

4775
05:34:57,240 --> 05:34:58,440
Oh, Wielder, you returned!

4776
05:34:58,840 --> 05:35:00,340
Let me have a look at the dream now!

4777
05:35:00,940 --> 05:35:02,940
So you have to have 700 essence?

4778
05:35:03,260 --> 05:35:06,680
I wonder whether the dreamers are watching you as you work or even the old king.

4779
05:35:07,460 --> 05:35:08,280
The lock of theirs.

4780
05:35:09,340 --> 05:35:09,840
Desperate.

4781
05:35:10,200 --> 05:35:11,240
But very clever.

4782
05:35:13,400 --> 05:35:25,380

Wielder.

4786
05:37:18,880 --> 05:37:21,140
It's time for you both to be awakened.

4787
05:37:23,440 --> 05:37:24,400
The essence you have collected.

4788
05:37:25,060 --> 05:37:27,020
The hope that still remains in this old kingdom.

4789
05:37:27,500 --> 05:37:28,580
Pure potential.

4790
05:37:29,600 --> 05:37:31,920
Let it course through you and into the dream now.

4791
05:37:32,120 --> 05:37:33,620
Hold it aloft, Wielder.

4792
05:37:34,080 --> 05:37:34,540
Awaken.

4793
05:37:37,060 --> 05:37:41,600
Alright, now I have whatever it is to get to the White Palace for Park War of Death.

4794
05:37:43,940 --> 05:37:44,420
Wait.

Okay, we put TP first.

4799
05:38:24,160 --> 05:38:26,460
But then I need to buy one more charm.

4800
05:38:26,540 --> 05:38:27,400
Oh, I don't have money.

4801
05:38:27,560 --> 05:38:28,100
Never mind.

4802
05:38:28,720 --> 05:38:29,380
Never mind.

4803
05:38:29,500 --> 05:38:30,460
I don't have money.

4804
05:38:30,840 --> 05:38:32,100
It's like a thousand something.

4805
05:38:33,120 --> 05:38:34,960
Um, was it down, right?

4806
05:38:37,260 --> 05:38:38,000
There we go.

4807
05:38:38,180 --> 05:38:38,980
This is my TP.

4808
05:38:41,040 --> 05:38:42,020
Oh, I can talk to her?

4809
05:38:43,880 --> 05:38:44,400

So, at the antique shop in City of Tears, I didn't save more of my brothers.

4813
05:39:27,660 --> 05:39:30,840
I know that was my mission earlier, but I didn't do it.

4814
05:39:30,940 --> 05:39:31,580
Oh, Dream Nail?

4815
05:39:32,940 --> 05:39:35,960
Why are you doing Pokemon that's the old man like mine?

4816
05:39:36,140 --> 05:39:38,740
Nothing of worth his hidden side, but keep probing.

4817
05:39:39,340 --> 05:39:39,700
Okay.

4818
05:39:42,120 --> 05:39:43,860
Okay, I'll sell stuff in the city.

4819
05:39:44,580 --> 05:39:46,720
So I can buy my last charm now.

4820
05:39:50,520 --> 05:39:52,720
Alright, um...

4821
05:39:52,720 --> 05:39:53,520
Or is this the closest?

4822
05:39:53,760 --> 05:39:54,520
Is it King Station?

4823
05:40:00,650 --> 05:40:02,390
Is King Station the closest?

4824
05:40:03,590 --> 05:40:03,930
Yeah.

4825
05:40:04,890 --> 05:40:05,470
Yes.

4826
05:40:13,120 --> 05:40:14,000
Oh, this way.

4827
05:40:15,480 --> 05:40:16,220
Ah, shit!

4828
05:40:18,900 --> 05:40:19,840
It's not fair.

4829
05:40:22,940 --> 05:40:25,140
Are we- can you even- Fight the collector?

4830
05:40:30,900 --> 05:40:32,100
I wonder...

4831
05:40:32,100 --> 05:40:34,140
Is it possible to fight him?

4832
05:40:35,960 --> 05:40:36,560
Yeah?

4833
05:40:40,760 --> 05:40:41,360
Oh.

4834
05:40:43,700 --> 05:40:44,740
Where is he?

4835
05:40:48,600 --> 05:40:50,360
Oh, you just... Wait, who's that?

4836
05:40:51,480 --> 05:40:55,180
Oh, what are you doing on this miserable downpour?

4837
05:40:56,020 --> 05:40:57,480
Impressive formula, isn't it?

4838
05:40:58,460 --> 05:41:27,980
you'll appreciate more we're both getting drenched the night up there was an important one the plaque here mentions its sacrifice which carries something of an ominous tone probably met some of the horrible end though it sounds like the night school may have been achieved in the process and all the relics i collected have yet to find a clue as to what that was oh wait are you the shop oh okay oh i just got lore.

4839
05:41:30,280 --> 05:41:30,760
Oh, the collector?

4840
05:41:30,940 --> 05:41:31,260
No, it's fine.

4841
05:41:31,340 --> 05:41:32,200
I don't need to fight him.

4842
05:41:32,940 --> 05:41:35,260
Wait, actually, how hard is the collector?

4843
05:41:40,140 --> 05:41:41,220
Oh, it is here.

4844
05:41:44,360 --> 05:41:45,560
I'll just sell all of it.

4845
05:41:45,720 --> 05:41:46,660
How many can I sell?

4846
05:41:47,040 --> 05:41:47,040
Okay.

4847
05:41:49,960 --> 05:41:50,360

Pass.

4850
05:41:52,760 --> 05:41:55,960
I tried collecting their light, but there's little information we glend of each.

4851
05:41:57,380 --> 05:42:04,740
Behind you, they do keep a nice shine above them, and there's nothing wrong with piercings appreciating something purely on aesthetic merits.

4852
05:42:05,840 --> 05:42:07,380
Okay, we need... How much do we need?

4853
05:42:11,540 --> 05:42:12,420
Oh, Nassil?

4854
05:42:12,880 --> 05:42:13,920

Now I have one more charm notch.

05:44:15,650 --> 05:44:16,510
Alright, where do we go?

4874

4877
05:44:33,990 --> 05:44:36,990
Oh yeah, I could replace the pride one.

05:44:37,470 --> 05:44:38,450
Wait, where are the chairs?

4879
05:44:41,250 --> 05:44:42,210
Oh, it's on this side.

4880
05:44:44,150 --> 05:44:45,110
Okay, you're right.

4881
05:44:45,250 --> 05:44:48,010
I could change that to the longer one.

4882
05:44:49,710 --> 05:44:49,790

I'm not that crazy.

4892
05:45:55,080 --> 05:45:56,060

I'm trying to figure out, like, where I need to go.

4988

Yeah?

4989
05:51:04,520 --> 05:51:06,520

05:51:10,080 --> 05:51:13,620
So, like, I can rearrange my charms.

4991

Up to rooms, then, right?

4992
05:51:20,080 --> 05:51:20,640
Where am I?

4993
05:51:20,640 --> 05:51:21,180
Oh, I'm here.

4994
05:51:21,440 --> 05:51:21,680
Okay.

4995
05:51:22,560 --> 05:51:23,760
But I'll go more.

4996
05:51:24,640 --> 05:51:24,720
Okay.

4997
05:51:24,740 --> 05:51:25,580
Oh, it's linear?

4998
05:51:25,980 --> 05:51:26,180
Nice.

4999
05:51:26,340 --> 05:51:26,680
That's good.

5000
05:51:26,820 --> 05:51:27,460
That's what I like.

5001
05:51:27,760 --> 05:51:29,820
Oh, if it's linear, I'll just swap my... Yeah.

5002
05:51:30,940 --> 05:51:31,580
I'll swap my bench.

5003
05:51:31,720 --> 05:51:32,800
I'll swap my charms now.

5004
05:51:33,680 --> 05:51:35,060
I wasn't sure if it was linear.

5005
05:51:37,920 --> 05:51:38,400
Ah, fuck.

5006
05:51:43,990 --> 05:51:45,390
I'll grab my charms then.

5007
05:51:46,990 --> 05:51:47,470
That's fine.

5008
05:51:47,650 --> 05:51:48,430
I'll tank it all.

5009
05:51:54,760 --> 05:51:55,440
That's fine.

5010
05:51:56,020 --> 05:51:56,960
I sit on bench.

5011
05:52:02,020 --> 05:52:03,320
What are my usual...

5012
05:52:03,320 --> 05:52:03,900
Oh my god.

5013
05:52:04,000 --> 05:52:04,920
Wait, is he coming over?

5014
05:52:07,100 --> 05:52:09,000
Okay, I need to know if you're coming over.

5015
05:52:16,160 --> 05:52:17,680
Guess I'll grab Mark.

5016
05:52:17,940 --> 05:52:18,520
I don't even remember.

5017
05:52:18,600 --> 05:52:20,060
Oh my god, I already forgot my loadout.

5018
05:52:21,180 --> 05:52:22,880
I don't remember my loadout.

5019
05:52:23,140 --> 05:52:24,160
What do we usually do?

5020
05:52:24,260 --> 05:52:25,000
I guess this?

5021
05:52:26,600 --> 05:52:28,080
Mark of Pride, Grub Song?

5022
05:52:31,260 --> 05:52:32,080
And then what?

5023
05:52:36,080 --> 05:52:37,080
I'm here.

5024
05:52:37,600 --> 05:52:37,740
Oh.

5025
05:52:39,740 --> 05:52:41,140
What can we do?

5026
05:52:41,920 --> 05:52:42,880
Our thorns?

5027
05:52:46,620 --> 05:52:47,820
Okay, we get shape.

5028
05:52:48,560 --> 05:52:49,980
We have to do this.

5029
05:52:51,700 --> 05:52:53,140
Use long nail quick slash.

5030
05:52:54,440 --> 05:52:55,860
Is that better?

5031
05:52:56,580 --> 05:52:57,940
I haven't done quick slash in a while.

5032
05:52:58,020 --> 05:52:59,320
I haven't done quick slash at all.

5033
05:52:59,880 --> 05:53:00,160
Alright.

5034
05:53:00,960 --> 05:53:02,180
Long nail quick slash.

5035
05:53:02,620 --> 05:53:03,540
That's our loadout.

5036
05:53:10,050 --> 05:53:11,050
Okay, it's this way.

5037
05:53:14,530 --> 05:53:15,650
I want to kill them.

5038
05:53:15,810 --> 05:53:16,190
I know.

5039
05:53:17,250 --> 05:53:20,010
I know, like, but you guys were like, stop killing the...

5040
05:53:20,010 --> 05:53:20,670

5041
05:53:23,570 --> 05:53:23,910
What?

5042
05:53:25,550 --> 05:53:26,610
I'm going to kill this guy, too.

5043
05:53:28,070 --> 05:53:28,630
There you go.

5044
05:53:29,410 --> 05:53:30,010
I don't care.

5045
05:53:30,150 --> 05:53:31,270
I will kill him.

5046
05:53:36,370 --> 05:53:36,730
Okay.

5047
05:53:37,070 --> 05:53:37,890
Let's go that way.

5048
05:53:38,730 --> 05:53:39,850
I'm just going to rush it.

5049
05:53:40,490 --> 05:53:41,750
Is he going to poop maybe, though?

5050
05:53:42,130 --> 05:53:42,770
He doesn't.

5051
05:53:42,830 --> 05:53:43,170
Oh!

5052
05:53:43,530 --> 05:53:44,590
Okay, I won't kill him.

5053
05:53:46,090 --> 05:54:01,970

5059
05:54:28,400 --> 05:54:29,500
Was left side nothing?

5060
05:54:35,480 --> 05:54:35,640
Woo!

5061
05:54:36,060 --> 05:54:39,300
Actually, I really want to grab the money.

5062
05:54:40,920 --> 05:54:42,560
I want to rob these bees real quick.

5063
05:54:45,780 --> 05:54:46,440
Okay, nice.

5064
05:54:50,010 --> 05:54:50,530

05:55:02,560 --> 05:55:03,260
Can't be up here.

5066
05:55:03,440 --> 05:55:03,840
Can't be out of here.

5067
05:55:03,960 --> 05:55:04,400
Can't be out of here.

5068
05:55:06,320 --> 05:55:07,180
Okay, nice.

5069
05:55:08,480 --> 05:55:10,040
Do you think they like jazz?

5070
05:55:15,630 --> 05:55:16,870
There is a mark try?

5071
05:55:17,270 --> 05:55:18,550
Well, it's too late on here.

5072
05:55:19,770 --> 05:55:20,110
Hello.

5073
05:55:20,370 --> 05:55:20,490
Oh.

5074
05:55:25,970 --> 05:55:27,390
Wait, I just need to dodge this.

5075
05:55:28,370 --> 05:55:29,410
I don't even have to fight!

5076
05:55:38,130 --> 05:55:38,490
Okay.

5077
05:55:41,490 --> 05:55:42,210
Oh, what?

5078
05:55:42,330 --> 05:55:43,430
That's my bad.

5079
05:55:49,980 --> 05:55:50,400
Okay.

5080
05:55:51,380 --> 05:55:51,980
That's good to know.

5081
05:55:52,100 --> 05:55:53,100
Oh, that's not good to know.

5082
05:55:53,300 --> 05:55:53,700
Wait, can I?

5083
05:55:54,280 --> 05:55:54,660
Yes.

5084
05:55:57,600 --> 05:55:58,020
Okay.

5085
05:55:59,980 --> 05:56:02,080
I don't think I can first try this.

5086
05:56:05,820 --> 05:56:06,640
Oh, nice.

5087
05:56:07,640 --> 05:56:08,180

5088
05:56:12,890 --> 05:56:14,550
Fucking stupid environment shit.

5089
05:56:14,650 --> 05:56:15,910
I hate that most.

5090
05:56:20,110 --> 05:56:25,310
Oh my god Oh my god of course

05:56:40,050 --> 05:56:59,510
Oh okay I fumbled I fumbled in the beginning because I didn't really know Like a pattern I get it now It was close I almost first tried that I think I could have first tried it If I like understood the pattern earlier

5092
05:57:03,780 --> 05:57:04,860
Where's the shortcut?

5093
05:57:07,720 --> 05:57:09,380
Oh my god, I keep falling.

5094
05:57:11,060 --> 05:57:12,640
Yeah, I almost first tried it.

5095
05:57:17,420 --> 05:57:19,640
Oh my god, these guys are annoying as hell.

5096
05:57:20,580 --> 05:57:23,060
Holy shit, there's three of them!

05:57:23,480 --> 05:57:24,440
Okay, I'm fucking...

I need to use the big B.

5100
05:57:36,900 --> 05:57:37,960

05:57:44,200 --> 05:57:45,240
Oh my god.

5106
05:57:46,280 --> 05:57:47,700
Why make that harder?

5107
05:57:54,060 --> 05:57:56,340
Yeah, these bees don't fucking play around.

5108
05:57:59,280 --> 05:58:00,960
Yeah, their TP is an easier idea.

5109
05:58:04,280 --> 05:58:04,560
Yeah.

5110
05:58:06,320 --> 05:58:07,740

05:58:08,700 --> 05:58:14,980
Oh my god, these guys.

05:58:15,500 --> 05:58:16,660
These guys are so annoying.

5113
05:58:22,380 --> 05:58:25,180
I don't really remember

5114
05:58:29,540 --> 05:58:31,480

Okay, there you go.

5119
05:59:09,190 --> 05:59:11,470
Oh, I can't set it in boss room.

5120
05:59:11,890 --> 05:59:12,410
Mmm, clever.

5121
05:59:13,450 --> 05:59:14,890
I can't abuse it.

5122
05:59:16,110 --> 05:59:17,850
Yeah, I can't abuse it.

5123
05:59:19,190 --> 05:59:22,110
Okay, I'm gonna hit the bees just because I...

5124
05:59:22,110 --> 05:59:22,770
Never mind.

5125
05:59:23,050 --> 05:59:23,950
That was a bad idea.

5126
05:59:24,110 --> 05:59:25,570
Oh, they can't die!

5127
05:59:26,070 --> 05:59:28,410
Yeah, that was a... I didn't realize they can't die.

5128
05:59:34,170 --> 05:59:35,670
Oh, what the fuck?

5129
05:59:36,930 --> 05:59:38,110

5130
05:59:40,330 --> 05:59:41,070
Hate these guys.

Oh, my God.

5134
05:59:52,290 --> 05:59:53,410

5137
05:59:59,150 --> 05:59:59,690
I'm dead.

5138
06:00:02,490 --> 06:00:03,410
I didn't think...

5139
06:00:03,430 --> 06:00:04,430
he was gonna jump over.

5140
06:00:08,190 --> 06:00:08,250
Oh.

5141
06:00:08,810 --> 06:00:10,050
I died too without bees.

5142
06:00:11,910 --> 06:00:13,370
I died too without bees.

5143
06:00:13,570 --> 06:00:14,150

5148
06:00:28,650 --> 06:00:29,430
Not the bees.

5149
06:00:30,010 --> 06:00:30,990
Not the bees!

5150
06:00:36,840 --> 06:00:39,460
Yeah, the little bees can't die, I'm pretty sure.

5151
06:00:56,660 --> 06:00:57,180
Hit.

5152
06:00:57,440 --> 06:00:58,040
Oh, what?

5153
06:00:58,480 --> 06:00:59,640

5154
06:01:01,560 --> 06:01:02,600
Oh, my God.

5155
06:01:05,080 --> 06:01:06,440

5166
06:01:45,170 --> 06:01:45,430
Oh,

5167
06:01:52,450 --> 06:01:53,570

5168
06:01:54,310 --> 06:01:54,830
Oh, shit!

5169
06:01:55,230 --> 06:01:56,370
That's my bad.

5170
06:01:56,790 --> 06:01:58,690
I thought...

5171
06:01:58,690 --> 06:02:00,870
I really thought he was gonna...

5172
06:02:04,840 --> 06:02:05,520
Oh.

5173
06:02:05,540 --> 06:02:05,880

5175
06:02:12,380 --> 06:02:13,020
I mean, I mean,

5176
06:02:26,320 --> 06:02:32,680
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm going to eat, I'm going to eat my, my thing next to your dead body.

5177
06:02:34,780 --> 06:02:36,100
Can't dream when you're dead.

5178
06:02:39,340 --> 06:02:39,720
Nice.

5179
06:02:40,740 --> 06:02:41,840
All right, three tries.

5180
06:02:43,100 --> 06:02:45,360
It took me a while to understand how to paddle.

5181
06:02:45,380 --> 06:03:18,300
fight him i'm still hungry so hungry all right now i could do the park boy dream dream dream no more oh hey my night at last you're freed small thing i know your kind attempt to resolve your past and know that i am not the queen you seek it's the pale beings that bear blame for your nature though this hive exists within hollowness we lay play no part in this attempt at perpetuation.

5182
06:03:20,320 --> 06:03:20,920
Do I?

5183
06:03:22,000 --> 06:03:24,740
The rail against nature is folly.

5184
06:03:25,460 --> 06:03:27,300
All things must accept an end.

5185
06:03:27,920 --> 06:03:28,340
Do I?

5186
06:03:30,880 --> 06:03:31,380
Do I?

5187
06:03:31,960 --> 06:03:33,560
You're queen in.

5188
06:03:34,920 --> 06:03:36,120
Do I?

5189
06:03:36,360 --> 06:03:37,240
I'm hungry.

5190
06:03:37,940 --> 06:03:38,820

06:03:45,380 --> 06:03:47,520
No, no, no, no!

5194
06:03:50,200 --> 06:03:55,040

5226
06:06:31,130 --> 06:06:31,650

06:08:47,150 --> 06:08:47,930
That's good.

5253
06:08:48,850 --> 06:08:50,910
It's like, wait a minute, I wasn't...

5254
06:08:50,910 --> 06:08:53,890
I thought I was supposed to do it without fucking parkour of hell.

5255
06:08:55,050 --> 06:08:56,090
Oh, is it here?

5256
06:08:57,610 --> 06:08:58,850
Let me shit on the chair.

5257
06:08:59,530 --> 06:09:01,430
Alright, now we gotta figure this out.

5258
06:09:01,650 --> 06:09:02,730
Okay, we don't need steady body.

5259
06:09:02,890 --> 06:09:03,990
We don't need shaman stone.

5260
06:09:04,290 --> 06:09:07,310
Guys, help me remember my loadout too, because I don't remember.

5261
06:09:07,810 --> 06:09:10,710
Alright, we get Markup Pride quick slash.

5262
06:09:10,870 --> 06:09:12,630
Oh, I don't want to get double.

5263
06:09:12,710 --> 06:09:12,970
Ah!

5264
06:09:13,530 --> 06:09:14,570
Double damage is fine.

5265
06:09:15,010 --> 06:09:17,270
I have, I have self-recent.

5266
06:09:17,370 --> 06:09:17,690
Oh, wait.

5267
06:09:17,810 --> 06:09:18,870
Why do I need Grub Song?

5268
06:09:21,590 --> 06:09:22,450
Wait, why?

5269
06:09:28,740 --> 06:09:29,200
Okay.

5270
06:09:30,700 --> 06:09:32,440
Oh, Markup Pride doesn't help.

5271
06:09:34,420 --> 06:09:35,960
What do I need then?

5272
06:09:43,720 --> 06:09:44,880
Okay, so what do I get?

5273
06:09:46,200 --> 06:09:47,000
Rage out of heart?

5274
06:09:51,290 --> 06:09:52,310
To survive.

5275
06:09:58,970 --> 06:09:59,970
Dash Master?

5276
06:10:01,630 --> 06:10:02,010
Alright.

5277
06:10:04,290 --> 06:10:05,310
Okay, here you go.

5278
06:10:07,470 --> 06:10:09,190
That's all I need to survive.

5279
06:10:10,330 --> 06:10:10,750
What?

5280
06:10:10,930 --> 06:10:11,770
Where is it?

5281
06:10:11,870 --> 06:10:12,590
Where do I go?

5282
06:10:18,840 --> 06:10:19,400
No?

5283
06:10:20,400 --> 06:10:21,900
Dashmaster will mess me up?

5284
06:10:22,320 --> 06:10:22,320
Okay.

5285
06:10:26,380 --> 06:10:28,320
And what do I- I have two slots!

5286
06:10:35,590 --> 06:10:36,250
Long now?

5287
06:10:36,530 --> 06:10:36,810
Okay.

5288
06:10:41,540 --> 06:10:43,080
All right, let's do it.

5289
06:10:49,070 --> 06:10:49,630
Oh!

5290
06:10:50,390 --> 06:10:50,710
Oh!

5291
06:10:51,010 --> 06:10:51,730
That's awkward.

5292
06:11:05,070 --> 06:11:07,530
Guys, it's gonna be a long day.

5293
06:11:11,270 --> 06:11:13,670
Whatever, is this where I'm supposed to go?

5294
06:11:17,270 --> 06:11:18,950
Hey, why is this block?

5295
06:11:23,880 --> 06:11:24,660
Good start, right?

5296
06:11:24,820 --> 06:11:26,260
Good start to parkour.

5297
06:11:33,980 --> 06:11:34,660
Wee.

5298
06:11:37,840 --> 06:11:40,400
Oh, more of this guy.

5299
06:11:48,610 --> 06:11:49,230
That's not cool!

5300
06:11:50,150 --> 06:11:51,430
It's not cool!

5301
06:11:56,890 --> 06:11:59,470
Oh, don't reach in now.

5302
06:12:00,410 --> 06:12:01,790
Oh no.

5303
06:12:03,090 --> 06:12:04,170
Oh, he does two damage?

5304
06:12:04,930 --> 06:12:05,230
Aww.

5305
06:12:06,010 --> 06:12:07,830
I did not know that.

5306
06:12:10,700 --> 06:12:12,960
I did not know that.

5307
06:12:13,180 --> 06:12:14,440
That's so rude.

5308
06:12:16,480 --> 06:12:17,380
What's this?

5309
06:12:18,960 --> 06:12:19,940
What did I do?

5310
06:12:22,260 --> 06:12:23,640
What did I do?

5311
06:12:32,350 --> 06:12:33,210
Door open.

5312
06:12:35,150 --> 06:12:36,330
Where's door?

5313
06:12:39,290 --> 06:12:40,650
Oh, that door?

5314
06:12:41,090 --> 06:12:41,890
How do I get back?

5315
06:12:44,210 --> 06:12:45,210
Oh, that door.

5316
06:12:45,550 --> 06:12:46,210
Oh, hey.

5317
06:12:53,410 --> 06:12:55,690
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

5318
06:13:00,850 --> 06:13:01,990
Was it back here?

5319
06:13:02,310 --> 06:13:04,250
I legitimately don't remember where the door was.

5320
06:13:04,670 --> 06:13:05,250
Oh, there it is.

5321
06:13:05,310 --> 06:13:06,210
Oh, there is door.

5322
06:13:06,950 --> 06:13:07,410
Door!

5323
06:13:07,930 --> 06:13:08,390
Yippee!

5324
06:13:09,710 --> 06:13:09,890
Oh.

5325
06:13:16,950 --> 06:13:17,410
Up.

5326
06:13:23,750 --> 06:13:25,010
Okay, up, I'll go.

5327
06:13:28,290 --> 06:13:29,250
Oh, I'm...

5328
06:13:29,570 --> 06:13:30,930
Oh, I'm hearing voices.

5329
06:13:32,030 --> 06:13:32,290
Hello?

5330
06:13:32,670 --> 06:13:33,030
Hello?

5331
06:13:34,990 --> 06:13:36,890
King, your troubles, let us.

5332
06:13:38,610 --> 06:13:39,310
Can I kill him?

5333
06:13:42,910 --> 06:13:43,810
Can they be killed?

5334
06:13:46,290 --> 06:13:47,870
King, your troubles, let us.

5335
06:13:48,750 --> 06:13:49,010
Hello?

5336
06:13:50,430 --> 06:13:51,410
Oh, oh.

5337
06:13:54,350 --> 06:13:58,190
Oh my god, look at all these juicy souls.

5338
06:13:58,870 --> 06:14:00,130
Just laying there.

5339
06:14:00,290 --> 06:14:01,250
Oh, they respawn?

5340
06:14:01,630 --> 06:14:01,990
Nice.

5341
06:14:02,930 --> 06:14:04,350
See, that's what I mean.

5342
06:14:05,350 --> 06:14:06,650
Look at these guys.

5343
06:14:06,930 --> 06:14:07,850
Literally, look at that.

5344
06:14:08,070 --> 06:14:09,530
Unlike the fucking mantises.

5345
06:14:10,890 --> 06:14:12,270
Wait, is Longdale not good?

5346
06:14:15,490 --> 06:14:17,730
People are saying someone said to get the mark.

5347
06:14:20,910 --> 06:14:22,230
I don't have...

5348
06:14:22,230 --> 06:14:24,190
I don't have enough space, though.

5349
06:14:25,590 --> 06:14:27,430
Yeah, I don't have enough space.

5350
06:14:27,590 --> 06:14:28,530
I don't have enough space.

5351
06:14:28,550 --> 06:14:29,870
I'll get Overtime.

5352
06:14:31,410 --> 06:14:32,450
Is Fragile Heart not good?

5353
06:14:32,610 --> 06:14:33,650
But I get more he is.

5354
06:14:35,990 --> 06:14:37,630
I mean, I could put that.

5355
06:14:38,690 --> 06:14:39,470
I'll put that.

5356
06:14:46,070 --> 06:14:47,730
Then what do I do to do?

5357
06:14:50,710 --> 06:14:51,110
Huh?

5358
06:15:03,200 --> 06:15:04,460
Not enough space.

5359
06:15:04,540 --> 06:15:05,940
Yeah, I don't have enough space.

5360
06:15:09,840 --> 06:15:11,660
I mean, I'm going to do Fragile.

5361
06:15:11,680 --> 06:15:14,240
I'll do Fragile Heart and I'll do Fragile Heart.

5362
06:15:15,160 --> 06:15:16,180
Oh, actually, long nail.

5363
06:15:16,660 --> 06:15:17,640
I'm gonna do that.

5364
06:15:19,260 --> 06:15:19,820
I'll do that.

5365
06:15:21,200 --> 06:15:21,840
I'm gonna do it.

5366
06:15:23,660 --> 06:15:31,640
Chat is our chat is fighting again, but I trust my, I trust my, I trust my, my soul.

5367
06:15:48,300 --> 06:15:50,820
Guys, maybe I shouldn't trust my soul.

5368
06:15:51,320 --> 06:15:52,000
Baby-

5369
06:15:55,260 --> 06:16:00,780
Baby, I shouldn't trust my soul.

5370
06:16:02,220 --> 06:16:03,920
I don't know, I got confused.

5371
06:16:04,360 --> 06:16:05,720
I was like, where am I?

5372
06:16:10,440 --> 06:16:11,280
Oh, hey.

5373
06:16:11,700 --> 06:16:12,820
Hey, that's another area.

5374
06:16:14,840 --> 06:16:15,660
Where did I get that?

5375
06:16:22,440 --> 06:16:24,040
Oh, it's over here.

5376
06:16:24,440 --> 06:16:25,440
Oh, hello there.

5377
06:16:28,740 --> 06:16:34,100
I was like, oh, look at these fucking buzz saws.

5378
06:16:35,100 --> 06:16:38,080
I hope nothing bad happens to me.

5379
06:16:40,760 --> 06:16:41,460
All right.

5380
06:16:45,140 --> 06:16:46,920
And so it begins.

5381
06:16:53,170 --> 06:16:53,650
Okay.

5382
06:16:54,150 --> 06:16:55,110
How do I get to this?

5383
06:16:55,710 --> 06:16:56,110
Oh.

5384
06:16:56,990 --> 06:16:58,210
Oh, okay.

5385
06:16:59,550 --> 06:17:01,550
Now we're palatating.

5386
06:17:04,850 --> 06:17:06,910
Oh my god, whoa!

5387
06:17:08,650 --> 06:17:10,150
Wait, how do I do this?

5388
06:17:13,570 --> 06:17:14,450
Wait, what?

5389
06:17:16,430 --> 06:17:17,430
So confused.

5390
06:17:21,270 --> 06:17:21,550
Wow!

5391
06:17:21,930 --> 06:17:23,670
I'm so confused.

5392
06:17:31,980 --> 06:17:32,160
Woo!

5393
06:17:33,380 --> 06:17:34,920
Okay, just stuff.

5394
06:17:35,020 --> 06:17:36,220
I wish I could look up.

5395
06:17:39,040 --> 06:17:39,680
Okay.

5396
06:17:41,120 --> 06:17:42,280
I wish I could look up.

5397
06:17:42,300 --> 06:17:42,540
up.

5398
06:17:42,960 --> 06:17:43,680
Oh, I can!

5399
06:17:45,300 --> 06:17:45,900
JK!

5400
06:17:46,880 --> 06:17:48,520
I can look up.

5401
06:17:49,020 --> 06:17:50,980
Okay, I just gotta look up longer.

5402
06:17:52,380 --> 06:17:53,000
That'll fuck.

5403
06:18:01,160 --> 06:18:01,880
Oh, okay.

5404
06:18:02,440 --> 06:18:03,380
Wait, what's over there?

5405
06:18:04,900 --> 06:18:05,800
Wait, which way do I go?

5406
06:18:05,860 --> 06:18:06,400
Oh, nothing.

5407
06:18:07,440 --> 06:18:07,740
Okay.

5408
06:18:11,040 --> 06:18:12,880
Gamers don't look up!

5409
06:18:14,960 --> 06:18:15,580
Oh, God.

5410
06:18:16,920 --> 06:18:17,400
Fuck.

5411
06:18:17,680 --> 06:18:17,900
Okay.

5412
06:18:23,420 --> 06:18:24,280
What the fuck?

5413
06:18:25,720 --> 06:18:26,380
Oh, whoops.

5414
06:18:27,540 --> 06:18:30,600
Yeah, I know I can pogo the sauce, but there's no need for it right now.

5415
06:18:31,560 --> 06:18:33,580
I don't think I need to pogo it.

5416
06:18:34,480 --> 06:18:34,600
What?

5417
06:18:39,150 --> 06:18:40,710
Okay, let me regen this.

5418
06:18:42,070 --> 06:18:42,530
Oopsie.

5419
06:18:58,600 --> 06:19:00,660
The magic is...

5420
06:19:00,660 --> 06:19:02,600
I cry out in pain.

5421
06:19:04,600 --> 06:19:08,080
Before I die, I had to cry.

5422
06:19:09,780 --> 06:19:10,640
Wait, why the fuck?

5423
06:19:13,180 --> 06:19:13,560
Huh?

5424
06:19:14,320 --> 06:19:15,600
Where do I go from here?

5425
06:19:16,380 --> 06:19:17,320
What the fuck?

5426
06:19:19,380 --> 06:19:21,180
I yelled into that boy.

5427
06:19:23,840 --> 06:19:25,540
Oh, it's down there.

5428
06:19:25,740 --> 06:19:26,140
Whoops.

5429
06:19:26,320 --> 06:19:27,380
That was so confused.

5430
06:19:35,980 --> 06:19:38,160
That was also a spike.

5431
06:19:40,620 --> 06:19:44,420
Okay, I didn't realize that was also a spike over there.

5432
06:19:44,920 --> 06:19:46,300
I was like, what the fuck is that?

5433
06:19:49,580 --> 06:19:51,380
Oh, okay.

5434
06:19:52,460 --> 06:19:52,980
I'm gonna wait.

5435
06:19:59,650 --> 06:20:00,370
Yeah, I gotta wait.

5436
06:20:01,530 --> 06:20:02,210
There we go.

5437
06:20:05,550 --> 06:20:06,950
Oh, I could have got that.

5438
06:20:07,970 --> 06:20:08,490
Wait, what?

5439
06:20:10,130 --> 06:20:11,210
Wait, oh, I did.

I was like, wait, where am I?

5442
06:20:18,910 --> 06:20:21,090
I did get there.

5443
06:20:24,150 --> 06:20:25,690
Wait, can I do this?

5444
06:20:28,330 --> 06:20:29,130
Oh, I can.

5445
06:20:29,470 --> 06:20:29,790
Nice.

Wait, what do I do here?

5448
06:20:43,250 --> 06:20:44,550
What do I do here?

5449
06:20:49,190 --> 06:20:50,110

Is that an area?

5456
06:21:36,520 --> 06:21:36,660
Oh.

Okay, yeah, I was gonna say, is that part of it?

06:21:45,380 --> 06:21:46,140
I said...

5461
06:21:46,140 --> 06:21:47,580
I dashed the wrong way.

5462
06:21:47,660 --> 06:21:48,560
I was trying to dash left.

5463
06:21:48,860 --> 06:21:49,920
I got scared.

5464
06:21:50,820 --> 06:21:51,920
I got scared.

5465
06:21:57,120 --> 06:21:58,140
There you go.

5466
06:21:58,760 --> 06:22:01,180
I was like, what the fuck is that?

5467
06:22:02,140 --> 06:22:03,560
Yeah, I'll now go.

5468
06:22:04,660 --> 06:22:05,120
Yay.

5469
06:22:08,100 --> 06:22:09,080
Which way?

5470
06:22:10,940 --> 06:22:11,300
Oh?

5471
06:22:11,820 --> 06:22:12,480
Hey, guys.

5472
06:22:12,980 --> 06:22:14,540
Oh, it's just this.

06:22:15,140 --> 06:22:16,420
Eh, I'll grab the full.

5474
06:22:20,100 --> 06:22:20,900
Grab the full.

5475
06:22:21,440 --> 06:22:22,740
Oh, I can farm these guys.

5476
06:22:23,440 --> 06:22:25,060
Farming my followers.

5477
06:22:28,560 --> 06:22:29,500
Oh, fuck.

5478
06:22:29,620 --> 06:22:30,740
I did not see that guy.

5479
06:22:34,700 --> 06:22:35,060
Okay.

5480
06:22:35,780 --> 06:22:36,760
Up, down.

5481
06:22:38,020 --> 06:22:39,320
Up, down.

5482
06:22:40,340 --> 06:22:41,240
They go...

5483
06:22:41,240 --> 06:22:41,880
Oh, okay.

5484
06:22:46,300 --> 06:22:46,640
Ah!

5485
06:22:48,320 --> 06:22:50,340
I forgot about that.

5486
06:22:50,440 --> 06:22:50,680
Okay.

5487
06:22:51,040 --> 06:22:53,060
When it goes up, I go down.

5488
06:22:57,960 --> 06:22:59,420
Oh, he's so fast!

5489
06:22:59,940 --> 06:23:00,480
What?

5490
06:23:00,780 --> 06:23:02,280
He's so fast!

5491
06:23:10,830 --> 06:23:11,550
Okay.

5492
06:23:12,170 --> 06:23:12,910
Get it.

5493
06:23:15,550 --> 06:23:15,810
Oh!

5494
06:23:16,430 --> 06:23:17,910
Oh, there's an area here.

5495
06:23:18,050 --> 06:23:18,230
Okay.

5496
06:23:25,070 --> 06:23:25,810
Oh, hello.

5497
06:23:26,290 --> 06:23:26,910
Yay!

5498

06:23:31,170 --> 06:23:32,390
Now where am I?

5500
06:23:32,490 --> 06:23:33,410
Oh, yay.

5501
06:23:33,870 --> 06:23:35,410
Okay, I got it.

5502
06:23:36,950 --> 06:23:38,350
Now where do I go?

5503
06:23:41,330 --> 06:23:42,670
Now where do I go?

5504
06:23:44,490 --> 06:23:45,570
next one.

5505
06:23:49,840 --> 06:23:50,520
The left side?

5506
06:23:52,900 --> 06:23:52,900
Okay.

5507
06:23:54,400 --> 06:23:55,180
Bench time.

5508
06:23:58,100 --> 06:23:58,760
Sleepy.

5509
06:24:01,340 --> 06:24:01,480
Where?

5510
06:24:01,740 --> 06:24:02,100
Where?

5511
06:24:04,020 --> 06:24:04,340
Oh.

5512
06:24:05,140 --> 06:24:05,580
Where?

5513
06:24:07,720 --> 06:24:08,740
This side?

5514
06:24:09,380 --> 06:24:09,400
Oh.

5515
06:24:11,340 --> 06:24:14,020
When he's like, oh, oh, wait, no, I've been here.

5516
06:24:14,160 --> 06:24:15,080
Have I been here before?

5517
06:24:17,400 --> 06:24:19,100
Have I done this before?

5518
06:24:26,170 --> 06:24:26,450
No?

5519
06:24:27,010 --> 06:24:27,510
Okay.

5520
06:24:27,930 --> 06:24:28,610
I couldn't tell.

5521
06:24:32,310 --> 06:24:34,630
Oh, I have to be faster than that.

5522
06:24:34,950 --> 06:24:35,590
Oh, I see.

5523
06:24:35,790 --> 06:24:36,390
I see now.

5524
06:24:36,530 --> 06:24:39,010
I was, like, wondering, like, how fast I was supposed to be.

5525
06:24:44,450 --> 06:24:44,810
Ah!

5526
06:24:45,250 --> 06:24:46,010
I'm okay.

5527
06:24:46,870 --> 06:24:47,970
I look up.

5528
06:24:53,640 --> 06:24:54,720
Oh, oh, oh!

5529
06:24:55,500 --> 06:24:57,100
Okay, I sort of realized.

5530
06:24:57,960 --> 06:24:59,620
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

5531
06:25:01,440 --> 06:25:05,800
Oh my god, I thought I didn't have to go all the way down.

5532
06:25:07,320 --> 06:25:07,980
That's my bad.

5533
06:25:08,720 --> 06:25:09,680
I was being silly.

5534
06:25:10,480 --> 06:25:11,480
Oh, come on.

5535
06:25:12,760 --> 06:25:13,600
I was being silly.

5536
06:25:14,140 --> 06:25:15,520
I'm just a silly bug.

5537
06:25:16,000 --> 06:25:17,860
Beep, beep, I'm a silly bug.

5538
06:25:20,760 --> 06:25:21,760
I love.

5539
06:25:22,720 --> 06:25:25,020

06:25:36,290 --> 06:25:39,350

5550
06:26:15,900 --> 06:26:17,260

5551
06:26:22,480 --> 06:26:24,120
Because I wasn't really sure what to do.

5552
06:26:32,350 --> 06:26:33,930
I can't say that.

5553
06:26:34,130 --> 06:26:34,470

5554
06:26:34,810 --> 06:26:36,030

06:28:38,000 --> 06:28:39,440
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

5577
06:28:45,270 --> 06:28:48,510
I need to, like, try pattern recognition for this.

5578
06:28:51,250 --> 06:28:51,670
Okay.

5579
06:28:54,770 --> 06:28:55,210

06:28:58,370 --> 06:28:59,890
Oh, I just walked for it.

06:29:00,750 --> 06:29:01,630
Take it.

06:29:02,170 --> 06:29:02,890

5583
06:29:03,110 --> 06:29:03,530

Oh, my.

5587
06:29:06,410 --> 06:29:08,490
That would have been so sick if I got that.

5588
06:29:09,550 --> 06:29:11,390
If I actually got that.

5589
06:29:15,530 --> 06:29:15,890
Omni-yum.

5590
06:29:16,650 --> 06:29:18,050
Don't keep these.

5591
06:29:19,050 --> 06:29:19,370
Whoops.

5595
06:29:33,600 --> 06:29:34,460
I'll stop walking.

5596
06:29:34,480 --> 06:29:35,760
That almost worked.

5597
06:29:36,140 --> 06:29:38,020
What if I just walked over, guys?

5598
06:29:38,520 --> 06:29:39,020
Guys.

5599
06:29:48,810 --> 06:29:51,090
Oh my god, what am I looking at?

5600
06:29:59,180 --> 06:29:59,340
Oh!

5601
06:30:00,440 --> 06:30:01,900
I fumbled it.

5602
06:30:02,220 --> 06:30:02,720
Pain.

5603
06:30:03,100 --> 06:30:04,040
This one's high.

5604
06:30:18,860 --> 06:30:19,380
Oh, whoops.

5605
06:30:19,680 --> 06:30:20,640
I should walk forward.

5606
06:30:21,800 --> 06:30:22,400
Whoopsie.

5607
06:30:30,070 --> 06:30:30,350

06:30:32,370 --> 06:30:34,230
Alright, I'll jump here.

5609
06:30:35,890 --> 06:30:36,890
Oh, no need to dash.

5610
06:30:37,730 --> 06:30:38,570
Oh yeah, you're right.

5611
06:30:39,690 --> 06:30:39,710
E-he.

5612
06:30:41,790 --> 06:30:42,470
E-he.

5613
06:30:42,650 --> 06:30:42,890
Oh!

5614
06:30:46,950 --> 06:30:49,650
Because I forget where they are.

5615
06:30:57,780 --> 06:30:59,060
Where am I?

5616
06:30:59,900 --> 06:31:00,980
Eternal question.

5617
06:31:01,900 --> 06:31:02,400
Okay, this one.

5618
06:31:02,560 --> 06:31:02,780
Ah!

5619
06:31:03,080 --> 06:31:03,420
No!

5620
06:31:04,340 --> 06:31:06,980
I was.

5621
06:31:07,800 --> 06:31:09,140
Okay, now I'm trolling.

5622
06:31:09,780 --> 06:31:16,200
Now I'm trolling.

5623
06:31:16,200 --> 06:31:16,920
Now I'm trolling.

5624
06:31:18,280 --> 06:31:18,660
Okay.

5625
06:31:19,680 --> 06:31:20,100
Oops.

5626
06:31:20,400 --> 06:31:25,620
I was being silly there.

5627
06:31:26,340 --> 06:31:27,080
Stop trolling.

5628
06:31:27,980 --> 06:31:29,360
It's still that's the last one.

5629
06:31:43,640 --> 06:31:44,240
Okay.

5630
06:31:50,980 --> 06:31:51,660
Okay.

5631
06:31:51,960 --> 06:31:52,880
I figured it out.

5632
06:31:53,140 --> 06:31:53,520
Yippee!

5633
06:31:55,740 --> 06:31:56,540
What the fuck?

5634
06:31:57,340 --> 06:31:57,660
What?

5635
06:31:58,600 --> 06:31:59,420
Wait a minute.

5636
06:31:59,580 --> 06:32:00,300
Oh, it's here.

5637
06:32:05,230 --> 06:32:06,590
Never mind.

5638
06:32:09,110 --> 06:32:10,030
What the fuck?

5639
06:32:10,050 --> 06:32:10,510
What?

5640
06:32:22,350 --> 06:32:22,770
Oops.

Oopsie.

5642
06:32:25,290 --> 06:32:26,750
That's so funny.

5643
06:32:27,270 --> 06:32:29,270
I got lost in the side.

5644
06:32:30,790 --> 06:32:32,310
I got lost.

5645
06:32:33,410 --> 06:32:35,190
I was like, where did I go?

5646
06:32:44,220 --> 06:32:46,260
Oh my god, I almost got it.

5647
06:32:46,640 --> 06:32:49,080
Accidental secret discovery.

5648
06:32:50,080 --> 06:32:51,780
I don't even know what I discovered.

5649
06:32:52,000 --> 06:32:52,500

06:32:53,740 --> 06:32:56,540

It's so hard to cancel in time.

5656
06:33:40,520 --> 06:33:41,540
I fall down.

5657
06:33:43,900 --> 06:33:45,200

Oh, oh my god, that's just a dream.

5663

5687
06:35:03,550 --> 06:35:04,690
Elevator in the middle?

5688
06:35:05,350 --> 06:35:05,730
This?

5689
06:35:07,150 --> 06:35:08,090

06:37:46,220 --> 06:37:46,900
There was nothing there.

5769
06:41:11,520 --> 06:41:11,960
Okay.

5775
06:41:37,020 --> 06:41:38,020

5776
06:41:38,740 --> 06:41:39,040
Up?

5777
06:41:42,770 --> 06:41:45,190
I didn't even know I skipped it.

5778
06:41:45,950 --> 06:41:47,030

5779
06:41:47,290 --> 06:41:48,850

5867
06:48:11,590 --> 06:48:12,670
Alright, let's wait.

5868
06:48:13,010 --> 06:48:13,650
I can wait.

5869
06:48:18,340 --> 06:48:19,880
Oh, I'm not doing it.

5870
06:48:20,100 --> 06:48:21,400
Like, I'm doing way too slow.

5871
06:48:22,380 --> 06:48:22,680
Yeah.

5872
06:48:26,010 --> 06:48:27,890
I wish I can skip that.

5873
06:48:29,210 --> 06:48:29,730
With this.

5874
06:48:30,790 --> 06:48:32,250
I wish I can just skip it.

5875
06:48:38,650 --> 06:48:39,210
Mmm!

5876
06:48:39,650 --> 06:48:39,810
Mmm!

5877
06:48:40,810 --> 06:48:42,670
I need a dash, not jump.

5878
06:48:45,610 --> 06:48:45,890
How?

5879
06:48:47,510 --> 06:48:49,150

5880
06:48:54,790 --> 06:48:55,230

Oh.

06:51:00,540 --> 06:51:01,960
Oh, I didn't realize!

5906
06:51:02,500 --> 06:51:04,160
I was like, yeah!

5907
06:51:04,520 --> 06:51:07,580
And then the fucking giant ass song came over there.

5908
06:51:08,860 --> 06:51:09,160
Oops.

5909
06:51:10,000 --> 06:51:10,760
That's my bad.

5910
06:51:15,840 --> 06:51:16,820
Okay, now...

5911
06:51:16,820 --> 06:51:17,540
Oh, this one.

5912
06:51:17,640 --> 06:51:18,820
Wait, I heard about this one.

5913
06:51:20,140 --> 06:51:20,380
Oh.

5914
06:51:21,240 --> 06:51:21,840
Okay.

5915
06:51:22,060 --> 06:51:23,360
Okay, okay, okay.

5916
06:51:23,680 --> 06:51:25,340
Okay, now I'm taking it seriously.

5917
06:51:27,120 --> 06:51:29,300
I just like ran into it.

5918
06:51:29,700 --> 06:51:30,200
I really have this.

5919
06:51:30,220 --> 06:51:30,960
I know this one.

5920
06:51:31,560 --> 06:51:32,460
This is infamous.

5921
06:51:33,180 --> 06:51:34,420
This one's infamous.

5922
06:51:41,580 --> 06:51:43,600
There's no skips here.

5923
06:51:44,740 --> 06:51:45,860
Oh my god.

5924
06:51:46,140 --> 06:51:47,740
There's no skips here.

5925
06:51:57,340 --> 06:51:58,820
Oh my god.

5926
06:51:59,840 --> 06:52:00,820
And this one's hard.

5927
06:52:06,680 --> 06:52:09,680
This is definitely the high blood arena area.

5928
06:52:16,120 --> 06:52:19,740
I was like, this confuses me a lot.

5929
06:52:22,380 --> 06:52:24,140
This one confuses me a lot.

5930
06:52:24,940 --> 06:52:28,340
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

5931
06:52:33,280 --> 06:52:33,840
Damn.

5932
06:52:35,600 --> 06:52:37,980
Time to dash when top spikes come up.

5933
06:52:39,020 --> 06:52:39,480
Okay.

5934
06:52:43,180 --> 06:52:44,720
Where do I time this?

5935
06:52:49,260 --> 06:52:51,260
Ooh, kudos.

5936
06:52:56,080 --> 06:52:57,120
Oh, oh.

5937
06:53:11,320 --> 06:53:13,320
Oh, oh.

5938
06:53:14,200 --> 06:53:14,560
Oh.

5939
06:53:14,580 --> 06:53:15,160
What about this?

5940
06:53:15,560 --> 06:53:16,200
Is it a top?

5941
06:53:36,470 --> 06:53:37,690
Is it still a dash?

5942
06:53:44,460 --> 06:53:44,820
Wow.

5943
06:53:45,440 --> 06:53:45,900
Yay!

5944
06:53:48,440 --> 06:53:49,440
Oh!

5945
06:53:51,800 --> 06:53:52,300
Okay.

5946
06:53:53,920 --> 06:53:58,140
I was like, whoa, I had a feeling that it was coming out, and I was like, I did it!

5947
06:54:04,000 --> 06:54:05,600
Oh, that's unlucky.

5948
06:54:06,600 --> 06:54:07,800
He got me.

5949
06:54:08,060 --> 06:54:09,380
I had a feeling, too!

5950
06:54:09,640 --> 06:54:11,500
I knew it was going to come up!

5951
06:54:15,500 --> 06:54:16,180
Oh, oops.

5952
06:54:16,760 --> 06:54:17,820
I waited too long.

5953
06:54:28,160 --> 06:54:28,600
Ah!

5954
06:54:28,940 --> 06:54:30,380
Oh, I don't know why I double jumped.

5955
06:54:30,480 --> 06:54:32,160
I'm getting nervous.

5956
06:54:32,760 --> 06:54:33,360
Oh, I'm nervous.

5957
06:54:33,700 --> 06:54:36,040
My belly is scared.

5958
06:54:36,380 --> 06:54:36,460
Oh,

5959
06:54:42,680 --> 06:54:42,920
nice.

5960
06:54:43,360 --> 06:54:43,540
Ow.

5961
06:54:46,200 --> 06:54:47,160
There you go.

5962
06:54:47,380 --> 06:54:48,040
I did it!

5963
06:54:48,220 --> 06:54:49,260
Is that it?

5964
06:54:52,460 --> 06:54:53,620
Hello, everybody.

5965
06:54:56,400 --> 06:54:57,840
Where do I have to go now?

5966
06:55:05,400 --> 06:55:05,980
Is that it?

5967
06:55:06,980 --> 06:55:08,060
Wait, did I do it?

5968
06:55:12,500 --> 06:55:13,200
There's more.

5969
06:55:14,120 --> 06:55:14,720
Go right?

5970
06:55:14,940 --> 06:55:15,200
Okay.

5971
06:55:17,320 --> 06:55:17,780
Dream nailed them.

5972
06:55:17,900 --> 06:55:19,240
They just say my king!

5973
06:55:20,580 --> 06:55:21,540
My king!

5974
06:55:23,500 --> 06:55:24,440
Let's see.

5975
06:55:25,060 --> 06:55:26,600
We will wait, king!

5976
06:55:30,560 --> 06:55:31,690
One section left?

5977
06:55:31,870 --> 06:55:32,110
Okay.

5978
06:55:33,570 --> 06:55:34,310
We're not go.

5979
06:55:35,390 --> 06:55:36,890
Do I...

5980
06:55:36,890 --> 06:55:37,870
Crystal dash them?

5981
06:55:44,590 --> 06:55:45,930
Is it this way?

5982
06:55:46,950 --> 06:55:47,770
Who dropped this king?

5983
06:55:47,890 --> 06:55:48,310
I know, right?

5984
06:55:55,980 --> 06:55:56,580
Okay.

5985
06:55:57,420 --> 06:55:59,580
I thought I could have a free crystal there.

5986
06:56:00,220 --> 06:56:00,460
Okay.

5987
06:56:06,440 --> 06:56:07,040
Here?

5988
06:56:10,360 --> 06:56:11,940
Remember to stop.

5989
06:56:12,500 --> 06:56:13,280
Thank you, guys.

5990
06:56:13,600 --> 06:56:14,480
Now I know.

5991
06:56:16,100 --> 06:56:17,300
Where do I go from here?

5992
06:56:18,680 --> 06:56:20,300
Oh my god, okay.

5993
06:56:31,050 --> 06:56:33,370
Is there fucking anything coming down from there?

5994
06:56:36,010 --> 06:56:36,590
Hello?

5995
06:56:38,350 --> 06:56:39,230
Excuse me?

5996
06:56:39,650 --> 06:56:40,230
Like, okay.

5997
06:56:47,630 --> 06:56:49,150
Like, where do I go from here?

5998
06:56:53,240 --> 06:56:54,700
Can I pogo that?

5999
06:56:55,980 --> 06:56:56,920
No, I can't.

6000
06:57:01,270 --> 06:57:02,830
There's nothing to my right.

6001
06:57:06,000 --> 06:57:09,240
Oh, max height jump.

6002
06:57:09,380 --> 06:57:10,160
Okay, there you go.

6003
06:57:10,760 --> 06:57:11,800
I'm a little special.

6004
06:57:16,360 --> 06:57:17,020
Okay.

6005
06:57:19,060 --> 06:57:20,020
Wait, I wonder.

6006
06:57:21,660 --> 06:57:21,880
Uh.

6007
06:57:24,620 --> 06:57:25,280
Ah.

6008
06:57:30,060 --> 06:57:31,780
Oh, that's a thorn.

6009
06:57:32,360 --> 06:57:33,760
I was, like, wondering what that is.

6010
06:57:37,260 --> 06:57:37,680
Okay.

6011
06:57:41,160 --> 06:57:41,820
Hmm.

6012
06:57:49,140 --> 06:57:49,820
Yeah?

6013
06:57:51,060 --> 06:57:51,100
Oh!

6014
06:57:52,040 --> 06:57:52,720
What?

6015
06:57:53,220 --> 06:57:54,480
Where do I go from there?

6016
06:57:55,940 --> 06:57:56,660
Alright, what?

6017
06:58:04,180 --> 06:58:05,340
Oh, whoops.

6018
06:58:06,660 --> 06:58:07,900
Oh, through the hole!

6019
06:58:10,920 --> 06:58:12,700
Oh, through the hole!

6020
06:58:13,080 --> 06:58:14,040
I was so confused.

6021
06:58:17,720 --> 06:58:18,160
Okay.

6022
06:58:24,650 --> 06:58:25,390
There you go.

6023
06:58:37,160 --> 06:58:38,140
What the fuck?

6024
06:58:38,160 --> 06:58:39,700
What the fuck am I looking at?

6025
06:58:39,980 --> 06:58:40,580
What the fuck?

6026
06:58:44,460 --> 06:58:47,500
Oh my god.

6027
06:58:48,400 --> 06:58:50,380
I got so nervous looking at that.

6028
06:58:50,480 --> 06:58:52,480
Because I was like, what the fuck am I looking at?

6029
06:58:59,360 --> 06:59:01,060
I didn't thread the needle.

6030
06:59:03,220 --> 06:59:04,260
More paths.

6031
06:59:04,880 --> 06:59:05,660
Excuse me?

6032
06:59:05,780 --> 06:59:06,600
What is that?

6033
06:59:15,570 --> 06:59:16,850
Yeah, I remember this.

6034
06:59:26,770 --> 06:59:28,190
This one's hard.

6035
06:59:29,290 --> 06:59:30,830
This one is the hardest so far.

6036
06:59:33,630 --> 06:59:34,190
Okay.

6037
06:59:58,760 --> 06:59:59,800
I don't even miss...

6038
06:59:59,800 --> 07:00:00,060
Yeah.

6039
07:00:00,460 --> 07:00:02,300
I had a feeling that...

6040
07:00:06,020 --> 07:00:06,800
That's fine.

6041
07:00:07,480 --> 07:00:07,960
No!

6042
07:00:08,360 --> 07:00:09,860
That's not fine!

6043
07:00:10,420 --> 07:00:10,620
No!

6044
07:00:16,520 --> 07:00:18,880
I got comboed.

6045
07:00:19,360 --> 07:00:22,020
I got comboed by the bugs.

6046
07:00:32,960 --> 07:00:35,280
They comboed me.

6047
07:00:36,280 --> 07:00:37,420
That's illegal.

6048
07:00:40,400 --> 07:00:41,780
This area.

6049
07:00:42,860 --> 07:00:44,160
Bug on bug violence!

6050
07:00:44,640 --> 07:00:46,460
Only I'm allowed to Kill it!

6051
07:00:53,640 --> 07:00:54,780
I don't think I... Oh, I do.

6052
07:00:54,980 --> 07:00:55,420
That's good.

6053
07:01:03,760 --> 07:01:04,200
Oh!

6054
07:01:04,540 --> 07:01:05,440
I got too close.

6055
07:01:06,140 --> 07:01:07,220
I got too close.

6056
07:01:25,930 --> 07:01:26,290
Ah!

6057
07:01:27,310 --> 07:01:29,230
This is... This one's difficult.

6058
07:01:29,590 --> 07:01:32,110
This one's the most difficult out of all of them.

6059
07:01:45,370 --> 07:01:46,650
For sure.

6060
07:01:51,200 --> 07:01:51,620
Oh!

6061
07:01:51,940 --> 07:01:53,080
I was too...

6062
07:01:53,160 --> 07:01:54,900
Too low.

6063
07:01:58,260 --> 07:01:58,760
Oh my gosh.

6064
07:01:58,880 --> 07:01:59,660
That one was silly.

6065
07:02:00,400 --> 07:02:01,160
That one is silly.

6066
07:02:10,900 --> 07:02:11,500
Okay.

6067
07:02:16,540 --> 07:02:18,080
I think I'm doing pretty...

6068
07:02:18,080 --> 07:02:18,400
Oh!

6069
07:02:19,680 --> 07:02:22,720
I think for like my speed for it.

6070
07:02:22,960 --> 07:02:24,980
I don't think I'm doing too bad, though.

6071
07:02:28,140 --> 07:02:29,400
Are you serious?

6072
07:02:29,440 --> 07:02:31,260
I always get messed up on the last one.

6073
07:02:34,040 --> 07:02:35,420
I think for how fast I...

6074
07:02:35,420 --> 07:02:37,800
I think I'm doing pretty decent speed.

6075
07:02:49,180 --> 07:02:49,780
It's literally this.

6076
07:02:49,880 --> 07:02:51,360
This is like my current filter.

6077
07:02:54,740 --> 07:02:55,240
Oh my god.

6078
07:02:55,520 --> 07:02:55,920
Always that.

6079
07:02:56,400 --> 07:02:58,080
I always end up getting too close.

6080
07:02:59,180 --> 07:03:00,580
I get too close to it.

6081
07:03:21,430 --> 07:03:21,870
Okay.

6082
07:03:30,630 --> 07:03:31,070
Oh.

07:03:33,310 --> 07:03:36,190

6086
07:03:58,660 --> 07:04:10,820

6087
07:04:26,640 --> 07:04:27,060
Okay.

6088
07:04:31,530 --> 07:04:32,910
Okay, there we go.

6089
07:04:44,800 --> 07:04:46,020
There we go.

6090
07:04:47,980 --> 07:04:49,000
What do you do here?

6091
07:04:50,180 --> 07:04:51,960
Do I just crystal dash it?

6092
07:04:52,380 --> 07:04:52,660
Chat?

6093
07:05:03,610 --> 07:05:05,590
Holy shit, I could have touched the horns.

6094
07:05:10,990 --> 07:05:13,090
I got scared.

6095
07:05:15,610 --> 07:05:17,270
I was like, What's that?

6096
07:05:17,590 --> 07:05:18,130
What's that?

6097
07:05:18,370 --> 07:05:19,770
What's that over there?

6098
07:05:20,690 --> 07:05:25,590
I swear, if I fell all the way down after that, I would have been so sad.

6099
07:05:26,750 --> 07:05:27,390
I...

6100
07:05:27,390 --> 07:05:35,410
If it actually made me fall all the way down, I would have been so sad.

6101
07:05:39,130 --> 07:05:40,950
Did I do it?

6102
07:05:41,770 --> 07:05:42,310
Oh, okay.

6103
07:05:42,870 --> 07:05:43,210
Wow.

6104
07:05:43,570 --> 07:05:44,470
Okay, not gonna lie.

6105
07:05:45,350 --> 07:05:46,470
Wasn't as hard as I thought.

6106
07:05:46,770 --> 07:05:47,770
The normal one.

6107
07:05:50,710 --> 07:05:50,990
Hello?

6108
07:05:54,380 --> 07:05:56,740
No cost, too great.

6109
07:06:02,090 --> 07:06:02,310
What?

6110
07:06:08,010 --> 07:06:08,410
Father?

6111
07:06:09,450 --> 07:06:09,670
Papa?

6112
07:06:12,060 --> 07:06:12,540
Oh.

6113
07:06:13,660 --> 07:06:14,240
Do I just...

6114
07:06:15,820 --> 07:06:16,500
Oh, okay.

6115
07:06:18,200 --> 07:06:19,680
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

6116
07:06:20,380 --> 07:06:21,680
I got it.

6117
07:06:21,900 --> 07:06:22,940
I got the thing.

6118
07:06:23,780 --> 07:06:24,620
The king saw.

6119
07:06:33,410 --> 07:06:35,590
Sola worm, Sola root.

6120
07:06:35,850 --> 07:06:36,730
Hide a void.

6121
07:06:43,930 --> 07:06:44,950
Okay, we did it.

6122
07:06:45,630 --> 07:06:46,830
We fucking did it.

6123
07:06:47,350 --> 07:06:47,850
Let's go.

6124
07:06:48,530 --> 07:06:50,310
Now back to the abyss.

6125
07:06:51,250 --> 07:06:52,230
Why the abyss?

6126
07:07:05,810 --> 07:07:06,990
Oh, okay.

6127
07:07:09,310 --> 07:07:11,390
Um, I got rid of that.

6128
07:07:12,050 --> 07:07:13,450
How much is it?

6129
07:07:14,290 --> 07:07:15,790
Holy shit!

6130
07:07:19,610 --> 07:07:23,410
okay um let's figure out how to do this

6131
07:07:29,850 --> 07:07:46,690
um i don't remember guys what the fuck were my load up guys i don't even remember what my load up was what's this holy charm symbolizing union between higher beings the barrel was slowly absorbed the limitless soul contained what opens the way to a bird now we're in try to shortcut Okay,

6132
07:07:47,290 --> 07:07:49,690
after we defeat, get the true ending.

6133
07:07:49,870 --> 07:07:51,810
We'll see how I feel.

6134
07:07:55,010 --> 07:07:56,510
Just have steady body.

6135
07:07:57,530 --> 07:07:57,790
Here.

6136
07:07:58,070 --> 07:07:58,770
Is that good enough?

6137
07:07:59,430 --> 07:07:59,690
Alright.

6138
07:08:01,210 --> 07:08:02,850
You don't need shaman stone.

6139
07:08:04,810 --> 07:08:05,930
Oh, you don't...

6140
07:08:05,930 --> 07:08:07,670
Oh, okay, I clicked the compass.

6141
07:08:07,990 --> 07:08:08,230
Okay.

6142
07:08:09,090 --> 07:08:10,270
I'll grab the compass.

6143
07:08:10,370 --> 07:08:12,210
But I have, like, extra stuff anyway.

6144
07:08:12,470 --> 07:08:13,430
And I'll grab Nognail.

6145
07:08:16,090 --> 07:08:17,020
Just for it.

6146
07:08:17,970 --> 07:08:22,450
I felt like I completed the parkour thing a lot faster than I expected.

6147
07:08:24,030 --> 07:08:25,430
Was that pretty fast for parkour?

6148
07:08:25,670 --> 07:08:26,390
I can't tell.

6149
07:08:38,380 --> 07:08:39,920
I did a lot of skips, too.

6150
07:08:40,580 --> 07:08:41,720
I didn't even realize I did skips.

6151
07:08:41,820 --> 07:08:44,180
I just assumed that was the right thing to do.

6152
07:08:45,540 --> 07:08:48,520
I legitimately just thought, oh, it should be this way.

6153
07:08:48,560 --> 07:08:50,460
I see a fucking platform up there.

6154
07:09:00,660 --> 07:09:01,480
Wait, what's this?

6155
07:09:03,740 --> 07:09:13,950
stone oh nothing i guess down i'll go

6156
07:09:18,020 --> 07:09:39,270

6157
07:09:42,530 --> 07:09:44,390
You guys weren't so failures, me, Mia.

6158
07:09:46,270 --> 07:09:48,530
Maybe you won't become empty husk.

6159
07:09:49,870 --> 07:09:50,670
Uh, ow.

6160
07:09:53,650 --> 07:09:55,050
Not good enough.

6161
07:09:57,070 --> 07:09:58,710
This is like a fucking maze.

6162
07:09:58,810 --> 07:09:59,790
I don't know where I'm going.

6163
07:10:05,800 --> 07:10:07,320
I'm gonna absorb real quick.

6164
07:10:10,100 --> 07:10:11,180
Okay, this way.

6165
07:10:14,200 --> 07:10:14,960
What?

6166
07:10:17,720 --> 07:10:18,340
That's me.

6167
07:10:19,780 --> 07:10:20,420
That's me.

6168
07:10:27,820 --> 07:10:28,840
That's me.

6169
07:10:29,760 --> 07:10:31,460
Oh, dream it.

6170
07:10:32,100 --> 07:10:32,720
Okay.

6171
07:10:33,360 --> 07:10:33,840
How's that?

6172
07:10:33,920 --> 07:10:34,320
Hello?

6173
07:10:34,720 --> 07:10:35,660
Knock, knock.

6174
07:10:38,760 --> 07:10:40,580
Oh, is that my egg?

6175
07:10:41,220 --> 07:10:42,640
No cost too great.

6176
07:10:44,500 --> 07:11:01,010
this egg is made for me I'm gonna blow my nose I'm not gonna mute myself that's me

6177
07:11:11,560 --> 07:11:30,280

6178
07:11:30,380 --> 07:11:31,380
Am I supposed to parkour?

6179
07:11:33,740 --> 07:11:35,500
Guys, what am I supposed to do?

6180
07:11:36,340 --> 07:11:37,500
Now we climb.

6181
07:11:38,260 --> 07:11:39,680
No mind the thing.

6182
07:11:43,820 --> 07:11:44,640
Oh, climb up.

6183
07:11:45,600 --> 07:11:45,600
Okay.

6184
07:11:49,000 --> 07:11:51,400
Where the fuck are the platforms?

6185
07:11:52,080 --> 07:11:53,900
I have to do the parkour again?

6186
07:11:55,340 --> 07:11:57,360
Just fucking parkour!

6187
07:12:09,450 --> 07:12:10,910
I can't believe it.

6188
07:12:11,790 --> 07:12:13,910
Back to parkour, I'll go.

6189
07:12:17,550 --> 07:12:19,310
No voice to cry suffering.

6190
07:12:24,520 --> 07:12:26,040
I literally just parkour.

6191
07:12:28,660 --> 07:12:30,920
Horn of God and void.

6192
07:12:33,360 --> 07:12:34,520
Oh, are these all the people that failed?

6193
07:12:34,840 --> 07:12:35,480
Climbing?

6194
07:12:36,520 --> 07:12:38,820
Just not as good as me.

6195
07:12:39,400 --> 07:12:39,720
Brothers.

6196
07:12:40,960 --> 07:12:41,480
Oh, hey!

6197
07:12:43,600 --> 07:12:44,300

07:12:55,300 --> 07:13:21,280

6200
07:13:24,760 --> 07:13:26,740
I was the failure.

6201
07:13:29,660 --> 07:13:32,040
I can't believe it all along.

6202
07:13:33,140 --> 07:13:34,540
I was the failure.

6203
07:13:40,100 --> 07:13:41,760
Time to go home.

6204
07:13:45,690 --> 07:13:45,950
Okay.

6205
07:13:48,590 --> 07:13:50,190
Who would have known?

6206
07:13:50,270 --> 07:13:54,010
Who would have thought it was me all alone?

6207
07:14:00,320 --> 07:14:02,340
Yeah, I'd like to see John Hollow Knight.

6208
07:14:02,640 --> 07:14:07,000
I'd like to see fucking Hollow Knight do the path of pain.

6209
07:14:11,140 --> 07:14:12,320
Oh, wait, they're not fighting anymore?

6210
07:14:12,980 --> 07:14:13,940
Oh, shit, you're right.

6211
07:14:16,840 --> 07:14:19,360
I do it not for self-defense.

6212
07:14:20,220 --> 07:14:21,460
But for fun.

6213
07:14:22,240 --> 07:14:24,020
Chill on this chase.

6214
07:14:26,600 --> 07:14:27,680
It's no...

6215
07:14:27,680 --> 07:14:30,800
I don't care that they're not fighting back.

6216
07:14:30,900 --> 07:14:32,020
You think I care?

6217
07:14:35,600 --> 07:14:38,400
I do it for the love of the game.

6218
07:14:44,400 --> 07:14:46,980
It's funny you think I care that they're not fighting back.

6219
07:14:48,600 --> 07:14:51,300
It's even better that they don't fight back.

6220
07:14:59,960 --> 07:15:00,360
Alright.

6221
07:15:01,820 --> 07:15:07,580
Oh Do you like to say that again?

6222
07:15:09,220 --> 07:15:11,840
No Okay,

6223
07:15:17,170 --> 07:15:25,910
this way No, I would like to not repeat myself a crazy statement

6224
07:15:33,740 --> 07:15:35,440
Oh, that's fine

6225
07:15:41,860 --> 07:15:44,640
Oh my god, I swear I've done the abyss so many times.

6226
07:15:44,760 --> 07:15:46,300
Oh my god, I could have used my TP.

6227
07:15:46,920 --> 07:15:47,340
I forgot.

6228
07:15:47,560 --> 07:15:48,580
Wait, where is my TP?

6229
07:15:49,160 --> 07:15:51,320
I could have used my TP this entire time.

6230
07:15:51,920 --> 07:15:52,600
Where is it?

6231
07:15:52,640 --> 07:15:55,580
I don't even know where my TP is anymore.

6232
07:15:56,680 --> 07:15:57,380
Oh my.

6233
07:15:57,540 --> 07:15:58,320
Oh, never mind.

6234
07:15:58,420 --> 07:15:59,920
Thank God I did not use my...

6235
07:15:59,920 --> 07:16:01,000
No, it's in the hive.

6236
07:16:01,600 --> 07:16:02,340
I would...

6237
07:16:02,900 --> 07:16:05,640
Imagine if I accidentally used my TP there.

6238
07:16:06,860 --> 07:16:10,760
I just like transported into the goddamn hive.

6239
07:16:15,500 --> 07:16:16,620
Thank God.

6240
07:16:27,830 --> 07:16:28,010
Alright.

6241
07:16:32,190 --> 07:16:33,550
It's time to do the...

6242
07:16:33,550 --> 07:16:34,590
Okay, before...

6243
07:16:34,590 --> 07:16:36,610
It's time to do the final boss.

6244
07:16:37,270 --> 07:16:37,830
Finally.

6245
07:16:39,150 --> 07:16:40,230
Wait, I have a new charm?

6246
07:16:45,420 --> 07:16:46,300
It's fine.

6247
07:16:46,420 --> 07:16:47,100
It's time.

6248
07:16:48,060 --> 07:16:48,760
What is it?

6249
07:16:50,340 --> 07:16:50,900
Oh.

6250
07:16:51,180 --> 07:16:51,860
Oh, nice.

6251
07:16:52,180 --> 07:16:52,440
Nice.

6252
07:16:52,460 --> 07:16:55,340
Okay, I don't need compass.

6253
07:16:56,340 --> 07:16:58,640
We do Mark.

6254
07:17:00,620 --> 07:17:01,700
Uh, what else?

6255
07:17:04,780 --> 07:17:05,280
What is it?

6256
07:17:05,600 --> 07:17:06,220
Shaman stone?

6257
07:17:09,020 --> 07:17:09,800
What else?

6258
07:17:12,560 --> 07:17:13,920
What should we do?

6259
07:17:16,040 --> 07:17:17,600
We have two more.

6260
07:17:21,390 --> 07:17:22,470

Do I need that?

6264
07:17:47,290 --> 07:17:48,430
Do you want me to stack that?

6265
07:17:48,770 --> 07:17:49,870

07:18:03,240 --> 07:18:04,640
I don't have enough for that.

6268
07:18:07,420 --> 07:18:08,580
Yeah, I don't have enough.

6269
07:18:10,980 --> 07:18:12,520
We'll just do this.

6270
07:18:14,040 --> 07:18:14,080

Let's put a portal here.

6273
07:18:36,720 --> 07:18:37,920
Just in case.

6274
07:18:46,930 --> 07:18:48,170
My left shop.

6275
07:18:48,310 --> 07:18:48,950
This shop?

6276
07:18:49,770 --> 07:18:50,250
Why?

6277
07:18:51,550 --> 07:18:52,350
Yippee, yippee!

6278
07:18:53,930 --> 07:18:54,250
Oh!

6279
07:18:58,200 --> 07:18:59,640
What's going on?

6280
07:19:03,510 --> 07:19:04,070
Oh, well?

6281
07:19:06,830 --> 07:19:07,490
Oh, well?

6282
07:19:10,170 --> 07:19:12,330
So, another would join our group.

6283
07:19:13,090 --> 07:19:14,050
I have a gift for you, warrior.

6284
07:19:14,350 --> 07:19:17,850
As a shopkeeper, I admit, parting with me for free is very difficult.

6285
07:19:19,630 --> 07:19:22,170
As a great nail sage, I must recognize your skill.

6286
07:19:22,590 --> 07:19:24,390
The master they are in my remaining pupils.

6287
07:19:24,870 --> 07:19:26,790
Now, traditional decrees you too may hold.

6288
07:19:26,950 --> 07:19:27,510
Wait, what?

6289
07:19:28,430 --> 07:19:30,050
He's a nail sage?

6290
07:19:30,750 --> 07:19:33,430
You shall be the last to receive it's like...

6291
07:19:33,430 --> 07:19:33,770
What?

6292
07:19:37,850 --> 07:19:38,370
Bama.

6293
07:19:38,670 --> 07:19:39,330
Off you go.

6294
07:19:39,610 --> 07:19:40,190
I have nothing.

6295
07:19:40,930 --> 07:19:43,350
I'll be up briefly and eager to take your G and...

6296
07:19:43,350 --> 07:19:44,450
Oh my god!

6297
07:19:45,730 --> 07:19:48,190
That's a big-ass knife!

6298
07:19:49,290 --> 07:19:50,210
Holy shit.

6299
07:19:50,530 --> 07:19:51,490
He's Yoda?

6300
07:19:52,630 --> 07:19:54,930
How did you hold that knife?

6301
07:19:56,850 --> 07:19:58,730
Have a dream nailed him yet?

6302
07:20:01,690 --> 07:20:03,250
Valkyrie are much dead earlier.

6303
07:20:04,450 --> 07:20:07,130
I mean, he made a good choice swiping careers.

6304
07:20:09,270 --> 07:20:10,750
Nah, I don't use any of the nail arts.

6305
07:20:11,430 --> 07:20:13,050
I just go slushy slushy.

6306
07:20:17,100 --> 07:20:17,320
Oh.

6307
07:20:17,720 --> 07:20:19,100
Alright, we save here.

6308
07:20:19,820 --> 07:20:21,100
And now we go.

6309
07:20:21,840 --> 07:20:24,640
We finally fight the boss.

6310
07:20:26,400 --> 07:20:27,600
Holy shit.

6311
07:20:27,900 --> 07:20:29,240
It's finally time.

6312
07:20:31,260 --> 07:20:32,660
Oh my god.

6313
07:20:32,980 --> 07:20:35,060
It only took us seven hours.

6314
07:20:35,680 --> 07:20:37,660
I swear, it's the rock man.

6315
07:20:37,940 --> 07:20:39,920
The rock man is my hubris.

6316
07:20:40,140 --> 07:20:42,410
Okay, I'm gonna grab slippers because my feet's cold.

6317
07:20:54,330 --> 07:20:54,610
Okay.

6318
07:20:55,230 --> 07:20:55,690
Ready.

6319
07:20:56,250 --> 07:20:57,610
Ready to fight him.

6320
07:21:00,030 --> 07:21:00,450
Hey.

6321
07:21:02,850 --> 07:21:03,910
It's time.

6322
07:21:09,470 --> 07:21:11,030
You guys said I couldn't...

6323
07:21:11,030 --> 07:21:11,590
Oh, hey.

6324
07:21:12,050 --> 07:21:12,630
Hello again.

6325
07:21:12,990 --> 07:21:14,330
This path is open.

6326
07:21:15,330 --> 07:21:16,670
I won't be joining you in this.

6327
07:21:16,890 --> 07:21:17,050
Oh, wait.

6328
07:21:17,090 --> 07:21:17,610
I already talked.

6329
07:21:17,770 --> 07:21:18,790
Shiri said that before.

6330
07:21:19,230 --> 07:21:20,330
Okay, we do this again.

6331
07:21:23,030 --> 07:21:23,890
Let me grab...

6332
07:21:24,490 --> 07:21:25,010
Oh, wait.

6333
07:21:25,470 --> 07:21:26,030
I'm sorry.

6334
07:21:26,750 --> 07:21:27,670
It was here.

6335
07:21:28,030 --> 07:21:30,250
Let me grab a cough drop before I do this.

6336
07:21:32,630 --> 07:21:34,210
Wait, is my teleport still at the hive?

6337
07:21:38,480 --> 07:21:39,340
There you go.

6338
07:21:39,780 --> 07:21:39,860
Oh.

6339
07:21:40,280 --> 07:21:41,160
Oh, this guy.

6340
07:21:43,980 --> 07:21:44,660
All right.

6341
07:21:49,020 --> 07:21:49,620
No, she was.

6342
07:21:49,820 --> 07:21:50,960
I talked to her before.

6343
07:21:51,600 --> 07:21:53,080
I remember talking to her.

6344
07:21:56,690 --> 07:21:57,690
I remember.

6345
07:21:58,190 --> 07:22:00,370
She was like, I won't join you.

6346
07:22:00,630 --> 07:22:01,690
And I was like, why not?

6347
07:22:02,430 --> 07:22:03,930
Why won't you fucking help me?

6348
07:22:10,560 --> 07:22:11,680
Oh, she wasn't.

6349
07:22:11,880 --> 07:22:12,280
Whoops.

6350
07:22:15,200 --> 07:22:16,440
I'm level two now.

6351
07:22:17,480 --> 07:22:19,200
I never leveled up to level three.

6352
07:22:24,320 --> 07:22:35,860

I remember that I can heal.

07:25:53,440 --> 07:25:53,580
Oh.

6379
07:25:54,140 --> 07:25:54,600
I'm dead.

6380
07:25:56,080 --> 07:25:56,860
Because I don't understand.

6381
07:25:57,620 --> 07:25:57,960
Oh!

6382
07:25:58,740 --> 07:25:59,440
That's unlucky.

6383
07:26:00,240 --> 07:26:01,120
I didn't understand.

6384
07:26:01,620 --> 07:26:02,680
Yeah, she does two hits.

6385
07:26:03,360 --> 07:26:04,280
I was confused.

6386
07:26:06,260 --> 07:26:06,880
Wee-ing.

6387
07:26:13,180 --> 07:26:15,820
Oh, I don't spin anymore.

6388
07:26:16,080 --> 07:26:16,960
Okay, let's do this again.

6389
07:26:27,440 --> 07:26:27,520
Oh.

6390
07:26:28,020 --> 07:26:29,380
Oh, that Pogo stuff.

6391
07:26:36,210 --> 07:26:38,690
I don't think I can do the...

6392
07:26:39,470 --> 07:26:40,150
I'm good.

6393
07:26:41,470 --> 07:26:42,570
Oh, what the fuck?

6394
07:26:42,710 --> 07:26:43,350

6395
07:26:43,910 --> 07:26:44,430
Okay.

6396
07:26:45,630 --> 07:26:46,870
That was my bad.

6397
07:26:47,130 --> 07:26:47,650
That...

6398
07:26:47,650 --> 07:26:48,030
Oh.

6399
07:26:48,750 --> 07:26:50,130
That was my bad.

6400
07:26:50,490 --> 07:26:51,710
That was actually so bad.

6401
07:26:53,670 --> 07:26:54,910
I'm y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all.

6402
07:26:59,340 --> 07:27:00,340
I messed up.

6403
07:27:00,440 --> 07:27:01,560
Oh, I'm messing up.

6404
07:27:01,700 --> 07:27:02,520
Wow.

6405
07:27:07,860 --> 07:27:08,500
Whoops.

6406
07:27:14,360 --> 07:27:14,680
Hello.

6407
07:27:16,020 --> 07:27:16,860
Oh, no!

6408
07:27:19,200 --> 07:27:20,840
I'm messing up my timing.

6409
07:27:28,400 --> 07:27:28,600
Okay.

6410
07:27:29,640 --> 07:27:31,120
I was messing up my timing.

6411
07:27:35,000 --> 07:27:35,640
Okay.

6412
07:27:36,300 --> 07:27:37,140
All right, I'll focus.

6413
07:27:37,400 --> 07:27:38,140
I'll hard focus.

6414
07:27:50,110 --> 07:27:50,630
Wow!

6415
07:27:51,850 --> 07:27:53,610
Why are you so far?

6416
07:28:03,700 --> 07:28:04,020
Okay.

6417
07:28:05,780 --> 07:28:06,800
There you go.

6418
07:28:07,020 --> 07:28:07,880
I'm just gonna eat first.

6419
07:28:09,420 --> 07:28:09,760
Okay.

6420
07:28:11,980 --> 07:28:13,020
Focus time.

6421
07:28:14,040 --> 07:28:14,720
Oh, no!

6422
07:28:15,520 --> 07:28:15,980
I forgot.

6423
07:28:18,240 --> 07:28:18,680
I forgot.

6424
07:28:29,300 --> 07:28:29,980
No!

6425
07:28:30,700 --> 07:28:31,240
No!

6426
07:28:31,840 --> 07:28:33,720
I didn't mean to do that.

6427
07:28:39,540 --> 07:28:41,580
No, you threw off my group!

6428
07:28:45,660 --> 07:28:48,620
It threw up my group!

6429
07:28:50,340 --> 07:28:51,700
Wing spin!

6430
07:28:53,400 --> 07:28:53,720
Okay.

6431
07:28:57,060 --> 07:28:59,580
My spaghetti is falling everywhere.

6432
07:29:02,580 --> 07:29:03,720
Yeah, hard focus for real.

6433
07:29:06,360 --> 07:29:08,380
I swear, guys, I focus now.

6434
07:29:12,650 --> 07:29:12,950
What?

6435
07:29:13,530 --> 07:29:14,070
Oh,

6436
07:29:19,820 --> 07:29:20,200
no.

6437
07:29:20,800 --> 07:29:21,540
I faced the wrong way.

6438
07:29:33,180 --> 07:29:33,440
Okay.

6439
07:29:34,540 --> 07:29:35,800
I put down the...

6440
07:29:35,800 --> 07:29:36,220
No!

6441
07:29:36,440 --> 07:29:36,720
Fuck!

6442
07:29:39,420 --> 07:29:40,140
No!

6443
07:29:40,340 --> 07:29:41,680
You threw up my groove!

6444
07:29:48,780 --> 07:29:50,520
I need to stop reading.

6445
07:29:51,480 --> 07:29:52,640
Reading is bad.

6446
07:29:56,200 --> 07:29:57,640
Reading was fat.

6447
07:30:01,180 --> 07:30:03,620
I'm yam yam yam yam yam yam yam yam yam yam.

6448
07:30:04,340 --> 07:30:04,960
I'm reading.

6449
07:30:05,140 --> 07:30:06,920
Sorry, I was reading chat on my phone.

6450
07:30:07,700 --> 07:30:08,340
That's why.

6451
07:30:17,210 --> 07:30:19,070
Oh my god, what the fuck?

6452
07:30:19,150 --> 07:30:20,610
How did he get so close to me?

6453
07:30:27,000 --> 07:30:27,960
Oh, unlucky.

6454
07:30:28,640 --> 07:30:30,380
I'm yam yam yam yam yam yam yam yam.

6455
07:30:33,880 --> 07:30:34,520
and drive.

6456
07:30:38,970 --> 07:30:39,610
Oh, what?

6457
07:30:46,610 --> 07:30:47,390
Not Toho.

6458
07:30:47,610 --> 07:30:48,290
Not Toho.

6459
07:30:48,710 --> 07:30:49,090
Not Toho.

6460
07:30:49,710 --> 07:30:50,410
Not Toho.

6461
07:30:51,530 --> 07:30:53,030
Anything but Toho.

6462
07:31:08,870 --> 07:31:09,550
Okay.

6463
07:31:18,650 --> 07:31:19,250
Not Toho.

6464
07:31:19,490 --> 07:31:20,050
Not Toho.

6465
07:31:20,310 --> 07:31:21,010
Not Toho.

6466
07:31:21,230 --> 07:31:21,910
Please stop.

6467
07:31:22,130 --> 07:31:22,730
Stop Toho.

6468
07:31:23,010 --> 07:31:23,390
Stop Toho.

6469
07:31:23,530 --> 07:31:24,090
Stop Toho.

6470
07:31:28,680 --> 07:31:30,100
What the fuck?

6471
07:31:38,220 --> 07:31:38,440
Well.

6472
07:31:39,040 --> 07:31:39,580
Like this.

6473
07:31:55,670 --> 07:31:56,790
Oh!

6474
07:32:00,070 --> 07:32:03,610
He's scary!

6475
07:32:04,570 --> 07:32:05,570
Oh my god!

6476
07:32:06,650 --> 07:32:07,350
She's scary.

6477
07:32:10,110 --> 07:32:11,430
I have to look up.

6478
07:32:13,410 --> 07:32:13,970
Guys!

6479
07:32:15,550 --> 07:32:18,410
I'm not used to looking up!

6480
07:32:34,230 --> 07:32:35,730
Oh my god.

6481
07:32:37,590 --> 07:32:38,070
What?

6482
07:32:43,410 --> 07:32:45,770
But I have to be closer to the race.

6483
07:32:47,630 --> 07:32:48,390
Oh my god.

6484
07:32:48,490 --> 07:32:49,550
Okay, I get it.

6485
07:32:49,630 --> 07:32:50,910
I'm always, I'm too far.

6486
07:32:51,310 --> 07:32:53,030
I'm too far from my race.

6487
07:32:53,210 --> 07:32:53,430
Yeah.

6488
07:32:54,510 --> 07:32:55,550
I know now.

6489
07:32:56,930 --> 07:32:57,790
I was too early.

6490
07:32:59,050 --> 07:32:59,430
Okay.

6491
07:33:00,830 --> 07:33:01,590
This guy.

6492
07:33:02,910 --> 07:33:05,870
I feel like I can end this faster.

6493
07:33:07,010 --> 07:33:08,270
If I use more magic.

6494
07:33:08,770 --> 07:33:09,390
Not gonna lie.

6495
07:33:09,870 --> 07:33:11,650
Yeah, I'm gonna try and use more magic for him.

6496
07:33:14,070 --> 07:33:17,630
I'm just gonna try and end it faster.

6497
07:33:23,570 --> 07:33:24,210
There you go.

6498
07:33:30,270 --> 07:33:30,850
Oh, fuck.

6499
07:33:31,310 --> 07:33:32,290
What the fuck?

6500
07:33:33,170 --> 07:33:34,130
What the fuck?

6501
07:33:34,450 --> 07:33:34,630
Okay.

6502
07:33:36,030 --> 07:33:37,250
That was a mistake there.

6503
07:33:42,350 --> 07:33:42,630
Okay.

6504
07:33:43,010 --> 07:33:43,790
Kill it.

6505
07:33:44,330 --> 07:33:44,770
Sighten.

6506
07:33:57,550 --> 07:33:58,310
Okay.

6507
07:33:58,970 --> 07:33:59,210
Oh!

6508
07:34:00,170 --> 07:34:00,930
What?

6509
07:34:01,650 --> 07:34:04,970
Oh, I was not expecting a double.

6510
07:34:06,930 --> 07:34:07,770
Okay, that's good.

6511
07:34:12,920 --> 07:34:13,340
Okay.

6512
07:34:21,740 --> 07:34:22,360
There you go.

6513
07:34:23,500 --> 07:34:24,200
Toho time.

6514
07:34:26,040 --> 07:34:27,000
Toho time.

6515
07:34:27,140 --> 07:34:27,200
Oh!

6516
07:34:27,720 --> 07:34:28,480
Toho time.

6517
07:34:28,580 --> 07:34:29,480
Oh, never mind.

6518
07:34:29,720 --> 07:34:30,760

6519
07:34:32,180 --> 07:34:33,400
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

6520
07:34:38,080 --> 07:34:39,400
Oh, my God.

6521

Oh!

6522
07:34:52,000 --> 07:34:52,480
My bad.

6523
07:34:52,860 --> 07:34:54,240
Yeah.

6524
07:35:15,140 --> 07:35:15,720
Yeah.

6525
07:35:20,410 --> 07:35:21,430
Oh my god.

6526
07:35:22,310 --> 07:35:23,130
Oh my god.

6527
07:35:23,970 --> 07:35:24,890
Oh my god.

6528
07:35:30,020 --> 07:35:31,460
Oh fuck.

6529
07:35:34,900 --> 07:35:35,180
Okay.

6530
07:35:41,980 --> 07:35:43,740
Oh, this is bad.

6531
07:35:48,200 --> 07:35:49,340
Oh my god!

6532
07:35:50,200 --> 07:35:51,180
Oh my god!

6533
07:36:10,030 --> 07:36:11,110

Oh my god!

6539
07:36:24,970 --> 07:36:27,550
I was not ready for that hell.

6540
07:36:28,610 --> 07:36:29,370
I was...

6541
07:36:29,370 --> 07:36:30,930

6542
07:36:30,930 --> 07:36:33,010
Oh my... I'm a mess right now, sorry.

6543
07:36:33,690 --> 07:36:36,030
I went through a lot fighting that guy.

6544
07:36:37,130 --> 07:36:38,630
Actually, I'm a mess right now.

6545
07:36:39,910 --> 07:36:41,550

07:36:41,630 --> 07:36:42,630

07:37:34,850 --> 07:37:35,530
Okay.

6551
07:37:38,570 --> 07:37:39,150
Oh.

07:37:42,290 --> 07:37:43,450
Oh, my God.

6553
07:37:43,630 --> 07:37:46,830
I accidentally ran into him while I was trying to knife him.

6554
07:37:47,450 --> 07:37:48,370
That was awkward.

6555
07:37:49,430 --> 07:37:50,330
That was...

6556
07:37:50,330 --> 07:37:51,050
Oh, my God.

6557
07:37:51,270 --> 07:37:51,970
And then it's Toho.

6558
07:37:54,970 --> 07:37:57,310
I was not ready for Toho.

6559
07:38:07,280 --> 07:38:07,920
Squash.

6560
07:38:09,920 --> 07:38:10,360

07:38:10,760 --> 07:38:11,440
Okay.

6562
07:38:14,320 --> 07:38:15,460
Oh, fuck.

6563
07:38:16,340 --> 07:38:17,780
I didn't expect him to do that.

6564
07:38:19,280 --> 07:38:19,880
Okay,

6565
07:38:24,790 --> 07:38:24,790

6570
07:38:35,150 --> 07:38:37,150
The furthest bullet ever.

6571
07:38:39,890 --> 07:38:40,890
Bro, right?

6572
07:38:41,050 --> 07:38:41,670
Oh, shit!

6573
07:38:45,260 --> 07:38:46,480
That was an accident.

6574
07:38:47,720 --> 07:38:48,780
Okay, now it's...

6575
07:38:48,780 --> 07:38:48,860
Yeah.

6576
07:38:48,880 --> 07:38:49,680

07:39:38,350 --> 07:39:38,850
Oh!

6584
07:39:40,390 --> 07:39:42,230
Radiance is hard.

6585
07:39:42,330 --> 07:39:42,710
Alright.

6586
07:39:43,770 --> 07:39:45,850
I'm, like, figuring her out.

6587
07:39:58,660 --> 07:39:58,780
Oh!

6588
07:39:59,220 --> 07:39:59,720
Unlucky.

6589
07:40:03,040 --> 07:40:04,060
Oh my god.

6590
07:40:04,200 --> 07:40:05,940
I'm just gonna do this real quick.

6591
07:40:07,820 --> 07:40:08,520
There you go.

6592
07:40:16,930 --> 07:40:17,270
Okay.

6593
07:40:22,260 --> 07:40:24,060

07:40:32,920 --> 07:40:33,340
Okay.

6596
07:40:37,460 --> 07:40:38,240
Okay.

07:40:42,100 --> 07:40:42,880
Okay.

6598
07:40:42,900 --> 07:40:43,800
Nice.

6599
07:40:46,200 --> 07:40:46,760
Oh.

6600
07:41:05,500 --> 07:41:05,880
Alright.

6601
07:41:12,650 --> 07:41:13,210
Oh.

6602
07:41:13,750 --> 07:41:14,890
I did not mean to do that.

6603
07:41:17,550 --> 07:41:19,470
Oh, but it's my favorite move.

6604
07:41:21,130 --> 07:41:23,170
Oh, it's my favorite move.

6605
07:41:30,430 --> 07:41:31,110
Oh, fuck.

6606
07:41:31,270 --> 07:41:32,290
Okay, that's my bad.

6607
07:41:35,400 --> 07:41:36,660
I got confused.

6608
07:41:37,160 --> 07:41:38,520
I got so confused.

6609
07:41:39,600 --> 07:41:40,900
Oh, nice.

6610
07:41:42,640 --> 07:41:43,620
Get good.

6611
07:41:43,940 --> 07:41:44,660
Get the!

6612
07:41:46,280 --> 07:41:46,980
Oh, my God.

6613
07:41:47,340 --> 07:41:47,660
Radiance.

6614
07:41:49,220 --> 07:41:50,500
Radiance time.

6615
07:41:51,620 --> 07:41:52,280
Where is she?

6616
07:41:54,160 --> 07:41:54,580
Yeah.

6617
07:41:55,600 --> 07:41:57,460
Now I know that's like a free shot.

6618
07:42:02,660 --> 07:42:04,880
Are you serious?

6619
07:42:12,200 --> 07:42:12,880
Oh.

6620
07:42:20,220 --> 07:42:21,140
Okay.

6621
07:42:28,060 --> 07:42:28,640
Okay.

6622
07:42:39,820 --> 07:42:40,300
Oh.

6623
07:42:51,040 --> 07:42:52,520
Oh my god.

6624
07:42:53,700 --> 07:42:53,940
Oh!

6625
07:42:55,480 --> 07:42:56,000
Oh god.

6626
07:42:57,880 --> 07:42:59,940
I hate this!

6627
07:43:04,940 --> 07:43:05,200
Oh!

6628
07:43:05,360 --> 07:43:05,960
Are you serious?

6629
07:43:07,040 --> 07:43:09,820
That's so fucking bullshit!

6630
07:43:19,070 --> 07:43:21,110
That's so bullshit!

6631
07:43:21,550 --> 07:43:23,210
Oh, the laser spot.

6632
07:43:24,350 --> 07:43:26,090
I was doing so well.

6633
07:43:26,990 --> 07:43:28,390
I was doing so well, too.

6634
07:43:28,670 --> 07:43:30,950
The laser spawn fucked me up.

6635
07:43:37,690 --> 07:43:37,750
Oh.

6636
07:43:38,990 --> 07:43:40,270
He actually jumped this time.

6637
07:43:52,240 --> 07:43:53,660
I was not expecting...

6638
07:43:53,660 --> 07:43:57,840
I was not expecting the laser spawn.

6639
07:43:58,180 --> 07:44:00,340
Because the laser spawn was so bullshit.

6640
07:44:03,640 --> 07:44:03,900
Oh.

6641
07:44:04,180 --> 07:44:04,900
What the fuck?

6642
07:44:07,080 --> 07:44:07,460
Oh.

6643
07:44:08,200 --> 07:44:08,820
Thank you.

6644
07:44:09,300 --> 07:44:10,680
Let me outer this corner.

6645
07:44:13,500 --> 07:44:14,660
I want me in the center.

6646
07:44:21,730 --> 07:44:22,250
There you go.

6647
07:44:22,530 --> 07:44:23,730
I can heal a little bit.

6648
07:44:25,470 --> 07:44:26,170
Oh, never mind.

6649
07:44:31,620 --> 07:44:32,720
Oh my god.

6650
07:44:33,520 --> 07:44:34,100
He's not...

6651
07:44:34,100 --> 07:44:35,640
What the fuck?

6652
07:44:36,400 --> 07:44:37,160
He's actually...

6653
07:44:37,160 --> 07:44:38,520
What the fuck?

6654
07:44:39,080 --> 07:44:41,200
He's actually not letting me do anything.

6655
07:44:43,600 --> 07:44:45,360
Fuck, at least skip this first.

6656
07:44:49,340 --> 07:44:51,360
Oh my god.

6657
07:44:53,700 --> 07:44:56,290
He's actually not letting me, like, do anything right now.

6658
07:45:01,030 --> 07:45:01,950
He's input reading.

6659
07:45:02,630 --> 07:45:03,250
Fucking cheater.

6660
07:45:05,630 --> 07:45:07,510
Are you serious?

6661
07:45:15,620 --> 07:45:17,290
He's input reading me.

6662
07:45:23,860 --> 07:45:24,140
Okay.

6663
07:45:25,440 --> 07:45:25,620
Oh!

6664
07:45:28,780 --> 07:45:30,100
He's lazy!

6665
07:45:32,370 --> 07:45:34,090
He is cheating!

6666
07:45:36,550 --> 07:45:39,070
He actually spawned in front of me.

6667
07:45:40,190 --> 07:45:41,110
What a bitch.

6668
07:45:42,110 --> 07:45:43,350
Bullshit spawn.

6669
07:45:51,040 --> 07:45:51,120
Oh.

6670
07:45:51,680 --> 07:45:51,860
Oh.

6671
07:45:52,240 --> 07:45:52,880
What the fuck?

6672
07:45:53,660 --> 07:45:55,360
I hit that perfect here.

6673
07:46:01,700 --> 07:46:02,260
There we go.

6674
07:46:02,380 --> 07:46:03,660
I'm just gonna heal just in case.

6675
07:46:05,380 --> 07:46:05,480
Oh.

6676
07:46:06,920 --> 07:46:07,860
That's unlucky.

6677
07:46:11,920 --> 07:46:12,240
Oh.

6678
07:46:13,580 --> 07:46:13,980
Oh.

6679
07:46:15,260 --> 07:46:16,680
He did the double.

6680
07:46:16,860 --> 07:46:17,640
fucking block.

6681
07:46:18,000 --> 07:46:19,200
I was expecting that.

6682
07:46:23,870 --> 07:46:26,290
Oh my god, he's parrying so much now.

6683
07:46:27,630 --> 07:46:29,450
He has not parried this much before.

6684
07:46:36,460 --> 07:46:38,900
Okay, but he has not parried that much before.

6685
07:46:39,180 --> 07:46:39,780
That's weird.

6686
07:46:40,960 --> 07:46:42,660
He has actually input reading me.

6687
07:46:45,560 --> 07:46:46,800
Fucking cheater.

6688
07:46:49,040 --> 07:46:51,100
He's actually input reading me.

6689
07:46:52,100 --> 07:46:53,980
I'm like, because you've never done that before?

6690
07:46:55,940 --> 07:46:57,760
What is this bullshit?

6691
07:47:01,140 --> 07:47:02,260
See, look at him!

6692
07:47:02,940 --> 07:47:05,540
He's actually endpoint reading me!

6693
07:47:10,880 --> 07:47:12,980
I'm like, where did that come from?

6694
07:47:35,680 --> 07:47:36,360
Alright.

6695
07:47:42,920 --> 07:47:44,680
That was a good dodge for me.

6696
07:47:45,600 --> 07:47:47,000
I was not even expecting that.

6697
07:47:50,700 --> 07:47:52,240
This should be soon.

6698
07:47:57,460 --> 07:47:58,940
There you go.

6699
07:47:58,940 --> 07:48:00,420
Let's get good time.

6700
07:48:03,800 --> 07:48:04,420
Get good!

6701
07:48:05,180 --> 07:48:05,900
Get good!

6702
07:48:06,380 --> 07:48:08,180
There you go.

6703
07:48:12,880 --> 07:48:14,600
You show bullshit, though.

6704
07:48:16,160 --> 07:48:17,860
She's so fucking bullshit.

6705
07:48:18,900 --> 07:48:19,600
Holy shit.

6706
07:48:21,340 --> 07:48:25,420
That was my bad.

6707
07:48:25,520 --> 07:48:26,340
I rushed that.

6708
07:48:31,730 --> 07:48:32,730
Are you serious?

6709
07:48:33,430 --> 07:48:34,370
Like, someone...

6710
07:48:34,370 --> 07:48:35,350
That shit shows...

6711
07:48:35,370 --> 07:48:37,330
up i can't see it

6712
07:48:51,300 --> 07:49:20,710
i know that i'm not going to win this one but i still i just want to do it for practice at this point the spike showed up what she did lasers when there's spikes below me oh my god I got boxed!

6713
07:49:23,350 --> 07:49:25,410
I actually got boxed!

6714
07:49:31,100 --> 07:49:31,940
That was cheating.

6715
07:49:33,480 --> 07:49:35,540
That was actually- Oh my god, and then he jumps.

6716
07:49:35,960 --> 07:49:36,960
You never jumped before?

6717
07:49:38,340 --> 07:49:39,520
What the fuck is this?

6718
07:49:41,720 --> 07:49:43,120
He's gonna eat just in case.

6719
07:49:44,260 --> 07:49:44,620
Why?

6720
07:49:45,440 --> 07:49:48,620
I just stood next to him and was like, Hey, hello there.

6721
07:49:51,700 --> 07:49:53,000
Input reading, yes.

6722
07:49:54,640 --> 07:49:55,540
Oh

6723
07:49:59,230 --> 07:50:19,440
Okay There we go His fucking knee got me What the fuck?

6724
07:50:22,710 --> 07:50:28,590
That's bullshit How did his knee fucking get me?

6725
07:50:31,510 --> 07:50:33,070
Oh, okay, that's unlucky

6726
07:50:39,780 --> 07:50:44,210
Yeah, his fucking ass was apparently too strong for me.

6727
07:50:51,700 --> 07:50:52,460
Oh, that's unlucky.

6728
07:50:55,360 --> 07:50:55,760
Yeah.

6729
07:51:01,090 --> 07:51:01,470
Alright.

6730
07:51:08,260 --> 07:51:08,980
Come on.

6731
07:51:17,280 --> 07:51:17,940
It's...

6732
07:51:17,940 --> 07:51:18,780
Get good!

6733
07:51:19,720 --> 07:51:20,760
Back here again.

6734
07:51:21,320 --> 07:51:21,920
I'm back here.

6735
07:51:22,020 --> 07:51:22,340
Hello.

6736
07:51:22,640 --> 07:51:23,580
Hello, my queen.

6737
07:51:23,860 --> 07:51:25,020
I'm here to kill you.

6738
07:51:33,300 --> 07:51:34,520
God damn it.

6739
07:51:34,680 --> 07:51:36,120
I shouldn't have done that.

6740
07:51:40,370 --> 07:51:41,050
What?

6741
07:51:45,920 --> 07:51:46,140
Okay.

6742
07:51:47,700 --> 07:51:48,380
I...

6743
07:51:48,380 --> 07:51:50,280
Oh my god.

6744
07:51:56,030 --> 07:51:59,050
I hate...

6745
07:51:59,050 --> 07:52:04,250
Oh my god.

6746
07:52:05,270 --> 07:52:06,550
I just got hit by everything.

6747
07:52:06,910 --> 07:52:07,610
I panicked.

6748
07:52:07,750 --> 07:52:09,030
I got hit by everything.

6749
07:52:09,310 --> 07:52:10,550
I don't know.

6750
07:52:11,290 --> 07:52:12,390
I don't know.

6751
07:52:14,370 --> 07:52:16,610
She was scary, okay?

6752
07:52:18,390 --> 07:52:20,490
Oh my god, it doesn't stop.

6753
07:52:20,610 --> 07:52:21,930
Now I'm getting hit by him.

6754
07:52:26,660 --> 07:52:28,320
It doesn't stop.

6755
07:52:38,360 --> 07:52:39,640
Okay, nice.

6756
07:52:44,420 --> 07:52:45,000
Oh my god.

6757
07:52:45,900 --> 07:52:46,840
That's supposed to be a Pogo.

6758
07:52:54,000 --> 07:52:55,280
Another one?

6759
07:52:56,320 --> 07:52:57,860
How many do you want to do?

6760
07:52:59,260 --> 07:52:59,900
Yes.

6761
07:53:03,000 --> 07:53:05,340
I'll just do this just in case.

6762
07:53:12,330 --> 07:53:14,070
I think I just parried that.

6763
07:53:14,270 --> 07:53:14,570
Did I not?

6764
07:53:19,600 --> 07:53:21,280
I'm just gonna heal a little bit.

6765
07:53:21,560 --> 07:53:22,440
And then...

6766
07:53:24,420 --> 07:53:25,320
There you go.

6767
07:53:32,290 --> 07:53:32,710
Hit.

6768
07:53:36,820 --> 07:53:37,820
Oh my god.

6769
07:53:38,180 --> 07:53:38,620
Fuck you.

6770
07:53:38,740 --> 07:53:39,480
Here's some magic.

6771
07:53:42,700 --> 07:53:44,760
Yeah, I did like three parries in a row.

6772
07:53:44,880 --> 07:53:45,260
That was crazy.

6773
07:53:45,280 --> 07:54:13,800

What?

6775
07:54:17,640 --> 07:54:18,660
Three times?

6776
07:54:19,360 --> 07:54:21,280
Okay, I wasn't expecting three times.

6777
07:54:21,720 --> 07:54:22,280
Not gonna lie.

6778
07:54:35,330 --> 07:54:38,290
I'm gonna try and focus up here.

6779
07:54:43,040 --> 07:54:43,500
God.

6780
07:54:52,110 --> 07:54:52,670
Okay.

6781
07:54:57,900 --> 07:55:00,300
I'm actually so hard focused right now.

6782
07:55:00,700 --> 07:55:00,920
Oh.

6783
07:55:02,000 --> 07:55:02,460
Okay.

6784
07:55:06,050 --> 07:55:06,790
Oh.

6785
07:55:10,450 --> 07:55:11,230
Oh.

6786
07:55:15,370 --> 07:55:16,150
Oh.

6787
07:55:17,170 --> 07:55:19,330
Because I know there's more than one phase.

6788
07:55:19,570 --> 07:55:20,350
That's the worst part.

6789
07:55:25,540 --> 07:55:27,560
I know he ain't...

6790
07:55:27,560 --> 07:55:29,080
Oh, thank god.

6791
07:55:40,140 --> 07:55:40,480
No!

6792
07:55:55,600 --> 07:55:57,560
No, are you fucking kidding me?

6793
07:55:58,000 --> 07:55:59,240
I have one life left.

6794
07:56:00,460 --> 07:56:01,100
Oh,

6795
07:56:14,240 --> 07:56:14,780
what?

6796
07:56:16,020 --> 07:56:16,400
What?

6797
07:56:27,970 --> 07:56:30,130
No, I didn't even see that!

6798
07:56:30,310 --> 07:56:32,250
I didn't even see the...

6799
07:56:39,150 --> 07:56:44,310
I didn't even see the orb.

6800
07:56:45,030 --> 07:56:47,870
The fact that they fight him again is annoying too.

6801
07:56:52,320 --> 07:56:53,720
Dude, I don't want to fight you.

6802
07:56:55,400 --> 07:56:56,580
Just let me fight her.

6803
07:56:59,420 --> 07:57:01,280
She's just tedious at this point.

6804
07:57:03,340 --> 07:57:04,420
You're stupid.

6805
07:57:04,500 --> 07:57:05,500
fucking head.

6806
07:57:07,200 --> 07:57:08,720
This stupid fucking head.

6807
07:57:12,120 --> 07:57:12,160
Uh.

6808
07:57:22,930 --> 07:57:23,510
Alright.

6809
07:57:24,010 --> 07:57:24,550
Munch munch.

6810
07:57:28,930 --> 07:57:29,150
Oh.

6811
07:57:29,950 --> 07:57:31,090
I used to waste in my...

6812
07:57:31,090 --> 07:57:33,950
I wasted my dash because I didn't think he was going to do that.

6813
07:57:34,670 --> 07:57:35,710
That was just my bad.

6814
07:57:40,180 --> 07:57:40,580
Okay.

6815
07:57:41,720 --> 07:57:42,600
That's good.

6816
07:57:42,740 --> 07:57:43,880
I actually needed a heal anyway.

6817
07:57:44,980 --> 07:57:46,560
Because I wasted my stuff.

6818
07:57:49,380 --> 07:57:51,840
Ah, I thought he was gonna do the slam.

6819
07:57:55,750 --> 07:57:56,890
It's just tedious.

6820
07:58:03,410 --> 07:58:04,090
Are you serious?

6821
07:58:05,090 --> 07:58:06,070
Are you serious?

6822
07:58:06,810 --> 07:58:07,350
Are you?

6823
07:58:07,450 --> 07:58:09,570
Oh my god, dude, fuck you.

6824
07:58:09,890 --> 07:58:11,150
Actually, fuck you.

6825
07:58:15,800 --> 07:58:17,580
I'm just so impatient now.

6826
07:58:23,390 --> 07:58:24,890
I just realized he didn't even use that.

6827
07:58:25,070 --> 07:58:26,070
This is his first time.

6828
07:58:31,190 --> 07:58:32,230

6834
07:58:53,730 --> 07:58:55,050
Oh my god.

6835
07:58:56,330 --> 07:58:57,170

07:59:12,450 --> 07:59:14,030

08:01:29,920 --> 08:01:31,180
There we go.

6865
08:01:32,160 --> 08:01:34,220
I like time it now for the dream though.

6866
08:01:34,840 --> 08:01:36,380
Because I'm not patient no more.

6867
08:01:48,290 --> 08:01:48,710
Yeah.

6868
08:02:06,040 --> 08:02:07,100

08:02:09,040 --> 08:02:09,980

08:02:41,920 --> 08:02:42,180
Okay.

6878
08:02:44,100 --> 08:02:44,780

6879
08:02:49,180 --> 08:02:49,860
Okay.

08:03:15,980 --> 08:03:17,640

There we go.

6894
08:05:04,190 --> 08:05:07,190
I'm just trying to do this as fast as I can.

6895
08:05:13,400 --> 08:05:13,880
Okay.

6896
08:05:17,040 --> 08:05:19,120
Okay, that's where he does his stabby stab.

Yeah, I can do this again.

6899
08:05:23,080 --> 08:05:25,320
That was a lot of damage that I just did.

6900
08:05:25,780 --> 08:05:26,720
Holy fuck.

6901
08:05:30,360 --> 08:05:33,420
Okay, I'm like stuck in the fucking corner of hell.

6902
08:05:37,980 --> 08:05:39,100
Holy fuck.

6903
08:05:40,860 --> 08:05:42,500
I was stuck down there.

6904
08:05:45,460 --> 08:05:46,740
I'm just gonna heal that.

6905
08:05:47,020 --> 08:05:47,480
Fuck this.

6906
08:05:56,420 --> 08:05:57,800
Oh my god, really?

6907
08:05:58,660 --> 08:05:59,600
Mr. Your scream.

6908
08:06:00,380 --> 08:06:01,080
There we go.

6909
08:06:06,020 --> 08:06:07,580
Oh, I tied the curtain clearly.

6910
08:06:07,760 --> 08:06:08,240
Get good!

6911
08:06:11,380 --> 08:06:12,020
Oh my god.

6912
08:06:12,040 --> 08:06:12,640
Oh my god.

6913
08:06:12,940 --> 08:06:13,580
Welcome back.

6914
08:06:23,490 --> 08:06:24,770
I'm not gonna...

6915
08:06:24,770 --> 08:06:28,550
If I'm like in like these corners, I'm not gonna risk shooting up.

6916
08:06:29,190 --> 08:06:30,590
Because that...

6917
08:06:31,570 --> 08:06:33,810
I can accidentally...

6918
08:06:33,810 --> 08:06:35,570
Oh, are you serious?

6919
08:06:43,590 --> 08:06:44,230
Okay.

6920
08:06:48,920 --> 08:06:50,500
I'm focusing right now.

6921
08:06:51,580 --> 08:06:52,600
I don't have to.

6922
08:06:53,300 --> 08:06:55,060
I have to hard focus this.

6923
08:06:56,060 --> 08:06:56,700
Okay.

6924
08:06:59,130 --> 08:07:01,290
sucks when I'm like stuck in a area.

6925
08:07:12,940 --> 08:07:14,520
Oh my god.

6926
08:07:21,480 --> 08:07:24,000
Oh my what?

6927
08:07:28,550 --> 08:07:30,600
Why is this so bullshit right now?

6928
08:07:34,010 --> 08:07:34,430
No!

6929
08:07:36,610 --> 08:07:41,250
Uh I just saw like spikes below me.

6930
08:07:42,090 --> 08:07:42,490
Yeah.

6931
08:07:43,530 --> 08:07:45,630
This boss is extra bullshit.

6932
08:07:45,710 --> 08:07:47,210
because of the RNG.

6933
08:07:49,630 --> 08:07:51,210
The RNG of getting...

6934
08:07:51,210 --> 08:07:51,470
Yeah.

6935
08:07:54,630 --> 08:07:57,450
It's just the RNG is so bullshit sometimes.

6936
08:08:00,050 --> 08:08:01,530
And it's like, I can't avoid it.

6937
08:08:16,820 --> 08:08:17,300
Okay.

6938
08:08:18,960 --> 08:08:23,880
I'm just trying to make this part the fat, like, do it as fast as I can.

6939
08:08:29,380 --> 08:08:30,420
I just want to do this.

6940
08:08:30,480 --> 08:08:31,340
Oh my god, seriously.

6941
08:08:31,980 --> 08:08:32,640
That's unlucky.

6942
08:08:42,970 --> 08:08:43,570
Nice.

6943
08:08:44,890 --> 08:08:45,070
Oh!

6944
08:08:55,560 --> 08:08:57,100
A gas fucking head!

6945
08:09:00,540 --> 08:09:02,360
Okay, I'm rushing this part.

6946
08:09:02,660 --> 08:09:03,400
I should...

6947
08:09:03,400 --> 08:09:03,620
Okay.

6948
08:09:05,700 --> 08:09:06,560
Oh no.

6949
08:09:07,360 --> 08:09:07,980
It's bad.

6950
08:09:08,340 --> 08:09:09,540
I'm actually...

6951
08:09:09,540 --> 08:09:12,040
I'm fucking on this part when I shouldn't be.

6952
08:09:14,060 --> 08:09:15,720
Yeah, I might actually die on this phase.

6953
08:09:19,470 --> 08:09:21,530
At least chop yourself.

6954
08:09:30,170 --> 08:09:31,470
I actually do this then.

6955
08:09:32,650 --> 08:09:34,590
So I don't want to worry too much.

6956
08:09:38,950 --> 08:09:39,350
Mmm.

6957
08:09:42,830 --> 08:09:44,010
Any jumps?

6958
08:09:45,230 --> 08:09:46,430
He doesn't jump before.

6959
08:09:49,030 --> 08:09:50,430
Stupid input read.

6960
08:09:50,730 --> 08:09:51,710
Oh my god!

6961
08:09:55,300 --> 08:09:56,900
Stupid input read.

6962
08:09:58,240 --> 08:10:00,920
I hate how he's input reading me.

6963
08:10:11,700 --> 08:10:12,460
Nice.

6964
08:10:12,800 --> 08:10:13,500
Alright, there we go.

6965
08:10:16,500 --> 08:10:18,040
Let's get good, Tab.

6966
08:10:19,320 --> 08:10:20,600
Get good!

6967
08:10:30,220 --> 08:10:32,440
Oh, of course he starts with this.

6968
08:10:33,240 --> 08:10:33,820
Oh!

6969
08:10:39,990 --> 08:10:40,750
Oh!

6970
08:10:40,890 --> 08:10:41,650
Oh, again?

6971
08:10:43,190 --> 08:10:45,150
Oh my god!

6972
08:11:02,420 --> 08:11:03,640
Oh my god.

6973
08:11:04,100 --> 08:11:04,980
He put me in the corner.

6974
08:11:05,780 --> 08:11:06,600
So I didn't know what to do.

6975
08:11:10,970 --> 08:11:11,250
I hate it.

6976
08:11:11,290 --> 08:11:12,290
I hate the double damage.

6977
08:11:14,790 --> 08:11:15,690
Are you serious?

6978
08:11:17,630 --> 08:11:18,150
Oh.

6979
08:11:21,930 --> 08:11:22,450
Oh.

6980
08:11:22,450 --> 08:11:23,630
This is not looking good.

6981
08:11:29,390 --> 08:11:29,830
Oh.

6982
08:11:31,430 --> 08:11:31,950
Oh.

6983
08:11:36,030 --> 08:11:36,550
Nice.

6984
08:11:36,810 --> 08:11:37,970
She did it twice.

6985
08:11:39,250 --> 08:11:40,370
So nice.

6986
08:11:40,950 --> 08:11:42,810
Oh my god.

6987
08:11:49,580 --> 08:11:49,940
No.

6988
08:11:50,460 --> 08:11:52,480
It's not worth healing until...

6989
08:11:59,970 --> 08:12:00,430
Hit.

6990
08:12:04,160 --> 08:12:06,100
Try and lock in the best I can.

6991
08:12:08,940 --> 08:12:09,260
Hit.

6992
08:12:11,640 --> 08:12:12,200
Okay.

6993
08:12:12,620 --> 08:12:13,480
I'm gonna lock in right now.

6994
08:12:13,600 --> 08:12:14,380
So I'm not gonna talk much.

6995
08:12:24,920 --> 08:12:25,700
That was an axe.

6996
08:12:25,720 --> 08:12:28,160
Oh, I got stuck in, like, the worst corner.

6997
08:12:29,680 --> 08:12:30,300
That sucks.

6998
08:13:15,650 --> 08:13:16,990
Oh, my God.

6999
08:13:18,890 --> 08:13:21,570
I was just in the worst place possible for this.

7000
08:13:23,070 --> 08:13:24,410
He hasn't used it in a while.

7001
08:13:32,040 --> 08:13:32,520
There we go.

7002
08:13:32,880 --> 08:13:33,580
We did it.

7003
08:13:34,720 --> 08:13:35,500
This is easy.

7004
08:13:35,920 --> 08:13:37,020
This one is easy.

7005
08:13:39,920 --> 08:13:41,380
Oh, what the fuck?

7006
08:13:42,160 --> 08:13:42,640
Oh.

7007
08:13:43,960 --> 08:13:46,180
It was like frame perfect.

7008
08:14:08,120 --> 08:14:08,500
Die.

7009
08:14:15,420 --> 08:14:17,100
Are you serious?

7010
08:14:20,810 --> 08:14:22,230
No, not the solar balls.

7011
08:14:47,700 --> 08:14:49,100
Oh my god!

7012
08:14:57,100 --> 08:14:58,060
Oh no!

7013
08:15:06,090 --> 08:15:08,170
I was too slow.

7014
08:15:08,450 --> 08:15:09,490
I was so slow for that.

7015
08:15:13,260 --> 08:15:16,580
It's literally just RNG of which moveset she decides to use.

7016
08:15:16,780 --> 08:15:18,300
But even then...

7017
08:15:18,300 --> 08:15:19,460
Holy shit.

7018
08:15:20,040 --> 08:15:23,540
Even then, the hardest part is literally phase 2.

7019
08:15:28,680 --> 08:15:30,620
And maybe like...

7020
08:15:30,620 --> 08:15:34,660
If I get used to phase 1, I might be able to...

7021
08:15:34,660 --> 08:15:35,760
Oh my god, that's unlucky.

7022
08:15:36,700 --> 08:15:40,340
I'm also like scared of like...

7023
08:15:55,530 --> 08:15:56,630
Okay.

7024
08:15:59,450 --> 08:16:00,850
What the fuck?

7025
08:16:01,170 --> 08:16:03,170
How did I miss that?

7026
08:16:11,610 --> 08:16:12,730
Jesus Christ.

7027
08:16:19,760 --> 08:16:22,600
He was on my head.

7028
08:16:24,860 --> 08:16:25,620
There we go.

7029
08:16:26,620 --> 08:16:26,960
Oh, wait.

7030
08:16:32,770 --> 08:16:34,190
That was so unlucky.

7031
08:16:35,450 --> 08:16:36,450
Oh, my God.

7032
08:16:36,570 --> 08:16:37,710
I might actually die in this phase.

7033
08:16:44,400 --> 08:16:45,080
Are you serious?

7034
08:16:45,180 --> 08:16:46,460
Oh, my God, I'm going to die in this phase.

7035
08:16:52,010 --> 08:16:53,130
He jumped!

7036
08:16:56,850 --> 08:16:59,410
Oh my god, he jumped!

7037
08:17:03,570 --> 08:17:04,410
Holy shit.

7038
08:17:08,220 --> 08:17:09,840
He actually jumped!

7039
08:17:11,380 --> 08:17:12,600
I rushed it.

7040
08:17:14,100 --> 08:17:15,800
I'm getting impatient right now.

7041
08:17:17,380 --> 08:17:19,180
Okay, I'm gonna lock back in.

7042
08:17:19,520 --> 08:17:20,320
Starting now.

7043
08:17:32,780 --> 08:17:34,360
I'm just getting impatient.

7044
08:17:41,580 --> 08:17:42,240
There you go.

7045
08:17:42,420 --> 08:17:43,580
I'm gonna heal just in case.

7046
08:18:07,710 --> 08:18:08,910
There you go.

7047
08:18:09,710 --> 08:18:11,450
Because I wanted to hit this time.

7048
08:18:19,190 --> 08:18:19,930
There you go.

7049
08:18:28,950 --> 08:18:30,110
This is the worst place for this.

7050
08:18:30,190 --> 08:18:31,770
This is the worst place for it.

7051
08:18:36,960 --> 08:18:37,340
Fine.

7052
08:18:38,140 --> 08:18:38,840
There you go.

7053
08:18:42,380 --> 08:18:43,620
Here you go.

7054
08:18:45,440 --> 08:18:46,100
Get the!

7055
08:19:04,150 --> 08:19:07,830
I'm just trying to be patient here because I want to know what move he's gonna use

7056
08:19:24,820 --> 08:19:37,450
it's actually bullshit when he does that again holy shit oh

7057
08:19:44,290 --> 08:19:45,390
my god

7058
08:19:48,580 --> 08:19:55,820
the RNG bro she's actually

7059
08:19:58,860 --> 08:20:01,960
like what what is this

7060
08:20:05,160 --> 08:20:22,960
oh there's no way i could have dodged that that's no way i actually got cheese there's no way you can dodge that she actually has like the most oh god yeah

7061
08:20:27,300 --> 08:20:35,340
that was actually such bad rng for me oh and then he Of course he jumps.

7062
08:20:41,100 --> 08:20:42,760
I swear to God.

7063
08:20:48,910 --> 08:20:50,830
That was like random bullshit time.

7064
08:20:53,130 --> 08:20:53,490
Nope.

7065
08:20:53,950 --> 08:20:55,450
I don't know how the fuck that happened.

7066
08:21:02,530 --> 08:21:02,910
Okay.

7067
08:21:03,290 --> 08:21:05,690
Just grab one and then...

7068
08:21:08,470 --> 08:21:09,390
Oh my god.

7069
08:21:09,510 --> 08:21:11,190
He bent forward so it didn't hit me.

7070
08:21:12,110 --> 08:21:12,430
What?

7071
08:21:12,890 --> 08:21:13,490
What?

7072
08:21:15,710 --> 08:21:16,310
Oh

7073
08:21:34,380 --> 08:21:37,220
my god.

7074
08:21:42,500 --> 08:21:43,080
There we go.

7075
08:21:43,380 --> 08:21:44,120
This should be it.

7076
08:21:46,560 --> 08:21:47,160
There we go.

7077
08:21:54,960 --> 08:21:55,760
Cool!

7078
08:22:03,720 --> 08:22:05,200
I just hate this one.

7079
08:22:05,600 --> 08:22:06,620
I just hate this move.

7080
08:22:11,590 --> 08:22:11,610
Hmm.

7081
08:22:14,210 --> 08:22:14,610
Of course.

7082
08:22:16,590 --> 08:22:17,830
A fucking course.

7083
08:22:18,390 --> 08:22:19,210
Oh my god.

7084
08:22:20,110 --> 08:22:20,870
Oh!

7085
08:22:38,080 --> 08:22:38,960
Oh my god.

7086
08:22:39,560 --> 08:22:40,820
I couldn't live through that.

7087
08:22:51,720 --> 08:22:53,660
These lasers are so brutal.

7088
08:23:01,780 --> 08:23:03,560
Oh, these lasers are so brutal.

7089
08:23:24,840 --> 08:23:25,660
I'm dead here.

7090
08:23:28,600 --> 08:23:29,520
Oh my god.

7091
08:23:31,140 --> 08:23:31,480
I'm not.

7092
08:23:31,520 --> 08:23:32,360
I shouldn't use magic.

7093
08:23:32,600 --> 08:23:34,580
I fucked up by using magic there.

7094
08:23:36,320 --> 08:23:37,820
Oh, I got greedy.

7095
08:23:38,520 --> 08:23:39,420
I got greedy.

7096
08:23:40,300 --> 08:23:40,900
Uh.

7097
08:23:41,660 --> 08:23:42,940
I got really greedy there.

7098
08:23:54,560 --> 08:23:54,720
Whoops.

7099
08:23:58,100 --> 08:24:02,640
I don't know if I should use magic when she does the constant sword thing.

7100
08:24:11,040 --> 08:24:13,060
Because I get punished for it too much.

7101
08:24:21,180 --> 08:24:22,380
How do I miss that?

7102
08:24:22,940 --> 08:24:24,480
Sometimes I don't know where that is.

7103
08:24:31,530 --> 08:24:32,210
Oh my god.

7104
08:24:32,310 --> 08:24:33,810
And sometimes he jumps, Ren.

7105
08:24:34,230 --> 08:24:35,070
I'll just eat.

7106
08:24:35,630 --> 08:24:36,650
Just for the sake of it.

7107
08:24:37,470 --> 08:24:37,710
Oh.

7108
08:24:48,240 --> 08:24:49,260
All right.

7109
08:24:52,780 --> 08:24:53,280
Oh.

7110
08:25:00,150 --> 08:25:00,650
Oh.

7111
08:25:01,010 --> 08:25:01,630
I mean, sure.

7112
08:25:02,310 --> 08:25:03,610
I'll take that.

7113
08:25:04,190 --> 08:25:05,390
I'll take that.

7114
08:25:14,980 --> 08:25:15,600
What?

7115
08:25:19,060 --> 08:25:19,740
Okay.

7116
08:25:21,000 --> 08:25:21,680
Okay.

7117
08:25:22,000 --> 08:25:22,440
I see.

7118
08:25:22,600 --> 08:25:23,080
I see.

7119
08:25:32,010 --> 08:25:32,350
Okay.

7120
08:25:32,830 --> 08:25:33,550
He should be.

7121
08:25:33,810 --> 08:25:34,730
It should be soon.

7122
08:25:35,630 --> 08:25:36,010
There we go.

7123
08:25:36,690 --> 08:25:37,070
Yeah.

7124
08:25:37,310 --> 08:25:37,970
Yeah, I know.

7125
08:25:38,130 --> 08:25:38,710
Exactly.

7126
08:25:39,330 --> 08:25:41,010
I was like, what the fuck was that?

7127
08:25:47,830 --> 08:25:49,490
This is a long...

7128
08:25:49,490 --> 08:25:50,670
This is a long stream.

7129
08:26:05,760 --> 08:26:08,080
I think I'm just getting really bad RNG too.

7130
08:26:12,950 --> 08:26:14,430
I think that's what's happening.

7131
08:26:16,730 --> 08:26:19,050
My RNG has been so bad for these...

7132
08:26:38,750 --> 08:26:39,790
Okay, hard focus.

7133
08:26:41,030 --> 08:26:43,610
Oh my god, like this.

7134
08:26:44,550 --> 08:26:45,250
Like this.

7135
08:26:48,010 --> 08:26:49,690
Just like that.

7136
08:26:50,110 --> 08:26:52,030
Like, oh my god.

7137
08:26:53,790 --> 08:26:54,410
I...

7138
08:26:54,410 --> 08:27:00,090
That was so bullshit.

7139
08:27:02,790 --> 08:27:05,590
Because that ball focused on me.

7140
08:27:06,290 --> 08:27:07,050
It focused on me.

7141
08:27:07,170 --> 08:27:07,950
It threw me off.

7142
08:27:10,190 --> 08:27:10,630
Hmm.

7143
08:27:10,650 --> 08:27:13,570
It hard threw me off there.

7144
08:27:27,600 --> 08:27:30,180
I got the grouper this guy, though.

7145
08:27:31,360 --> 08:27:32,200
It's okay, Edgar.

7146
08:27:32,580 --> 08:27:33,320
I got this.

7147
08:27:33,960 --> 08:27:34,860
Oh, what the fuck?

7148
08:27:35,400 --> 08:27:35,660
Nice.

7149
08:28:06,160 --> 08:28:06,700
Alright.

7150
08:28:07,560 --> 08:28:08,020
Oh,

7151
08:28:14,110 --> 08:28:18,570
I had no hit until he fucking slammed his head against me.

7152
08:28:19,430 --> 08:28:20,050
That's...

7153
08:28:20,050 --> 08:28:21,450
Okay, that's cool.

7154
08:28:22,990 --> 08:28:25,050
I like how I went no hit until then.

7155
08:28:27,430 --> 08:28:37,410
oh my god now i'm getting hit all the time oh my god now i'm getting all the hit he actually threw me up

7156
08:28:40,890 --> 08:28:50,190
stupid head i know it's doing so well too

7157
08:28:57,970 --> 08:29:07,830
oh that was like one second too fast hollow knight learn head oh i don't even have the spell that's so i'm gonna do this right now.

7158
08:29:08,670 --> 08:29:09,030
That's it.

7159
08:29:13,990 --> 08:29:14,970
That's my fault.

7160
08:29:20,270 --> 08:29:21,170
I messed up.

7161
08:29:33,200 --> 08:29:33,660
Okay.

7162
08:29:41,240 --> 08:29:41,540
Oh.

7163
08:29:44,260 --> 08:29:46,180
I can't believe it.

7164
08:29:46,220 --> 08:29:47,700
I can't get out of there.

7165
08:30:08,920 --> 08:30:11,820
I got the face too really fast with that, though.

7166
08:30:14,100 --> 08:30:15,540
I got a face...

7167
08:30:15,540 --> 08:30:15,740
I got a face...

7168
08:30:15,760 --> 08:30:27,280
actually got to the not phase two um is that phase two when he does the middle i don't know i don't know if that's considered phase two

7169
08:30:40,610 --> 08:31:02,610
sometimes it doesn't hit the hitbox for him is so slow oh phase two is when the okay i got to like the phase where oh Whatever phase it is When she starts hitting the middle I got that Oh, that's unlucky

7170
08:31:06,640 --> 08:31:10,640
Oh It's fine, I'll heal a little bit

7171
08:31:16,760 --> 08:31:28,420
Stupid headbutt And then he randomly jumps That's cool And then he randomly toe-hose me That's cool too Oh

7172
08:31:38,950 --> 08:31:41,390
I hate it when he does that headbutt!

7173
08:31:44,870 --> 08:31:45,690
Am I dying in this phase?

7174
08:31:48,210 --> 08:31:50,290
And, uh, just grab one.

7175
08:31:50,610 --> 08:31:51,230
There, fuck it.

7176
08:31:59,260 --> 08:32:00,820
Oh, I thought he was gonna scream.

7177
08:32:12,540 --> 08:32:13,800
There we go.

7178
08:32:16,860 --> 08:32:17,140
Fuck.

7179
08:32:21,500 --> 08:32:22,020
Alright.

7180
08:32:23,780 --> 08:32:24,660
Yeah, I am.

7181
08:32:24,900 --> 08:32:26,620
I am getting too impatient, though.

7182
08:32:35,890 --> 08:32:36,490
Okay.

7183
08:32:56,940 --> 08:32:57,300
Oh.

7184
08:33:08,240 --> 08:33:09,160
Oh my god.

7185
08:33:10,240 --> 08:33:10,780
Oh my god.

7186
08:33:11,940 --> 08:33:12,060
Oh!

7187
08:33:13,940 --> 08:33:15,880
I just hate it when they spawn in.

7188
08:33:18,340 --> 08:33:18,920
Of course.

7189
08:33:25,060 --> 08:33:25,560
Of course.

7190
08:33:41,030 --> 08:33:41,910
My last HP.

7191
08:34:25,390 --> 08:34:26,570
Holy shit.

7192
08:34:28,130 --> 08:34:29,430
I hate her.

7193
08:34:29,510 --> 08:34:31,390
I hate her so much.

7194
08:34:32,070 --> 08:34:32,690
No, I did.

7195
08:34:32,850 --> 08:34:33,510
I drank water.

7196
08:34:33,610 --> 08:34:34,690
I can hydrate in.

7197
08:34:38,210 --> 08:34:39,670
Oh my god.

7198
08:34:41,390 --> 08:34:42,590
Am I winning?

7199
08:34:42,870 --> 08:34:44,470
When will this nightmare end?

7200
08:34:46,310 --> 08:34:47,570
That's a good question.

7201
08:34:56,800 --> 08:34:57,080
Yeah.

7202
08:35:02,770 --> 08:35:04,150
Oh, I was unlucky.

7203
08:35:05,050 --> 08:35:06,170
I was not expecting that.

7204
08:35:08,170 --> 08:35:10,970
She's stupid fucking ass!

7205
08:35:13,530 --> 08:35:14,650
This booty!

7206
08:35:17,410 --> 08:35:21,710
This booty actually...

7207
08:35:21,710 --> 08:35:22,530
Oh, unlucky.

7208
08:35:28,280 --> 08:35:31,000
I'm just gonna heal a little bit.

7209
08:35:32,700 --> 08:35:32,980
Mmm.

7210
08:35:38,770 --> 08:35:40,450
Oh my god.

7211
08:35:45,440 --> 08:35:47,880
This pattern has been like, changing.

7212
08:35:50,900 --> 08:35:51,400
Damn.

7213
08:35:51,700 --> 08:35:53,040
I actually need heal though.

7214
08:35:57,580 --> 08:35:57,620
Okay.

7215
08:36:07,250 --> 08:36:07,750
Nice.

7216
08:36:23,490 --> 08:36:24,330
Oh my god.

7217
08:36:24,810 --> 08:36:26,890
I'm worried that he's gonna headbutt me.

7218
08:36:29,290 --> 08:36:31,750
I'm trying to make sure he doesn't headbutt me.

7219
08:36:37,990 --> 08:36:38,650
Okay, there you go.

7220
08:36:40,850 --> 08:36:40,990
Oh.

7221
08:36:43,750 --> 08:36:55,530
fear of the head but okay here again oh my god even my master phase one I still have phase two I

7222
08:37:05,060 --> 08:37:07,080
was not expecting that

7223
08:37:20,830 --> 08:37:26,710
oh I didn't expect that either

7224
08:37:30,860 --> 08:37:34,980
okay again

7225
08:37:54,020 --> 08:38:05,840
oh my on again what

7226
08:38:15,080 --> 08:38:17,580

7227
08:38:30,660 --> 08:38:36,440
oh I

7228
08:38:39,720 --> 08:38:57,280
don't know if that was bullshit or not but it felt bullshit I will say that felt so bullshit oh I only have 4 HP I I... This is not it.

7229
08:38:58,620 --> 08:39:00,280
This is not it.

7230
08:39:11,360 --> 08:39:13,100
Wait, where is she?

7231
08:39:19,330 --> 08:39:20,750
Oh my god.

7232
08:39:21,370 --> 08:39:23,070
I don't know what to do for that.

7233
08:39:23,790 --> 08:39:24,450
I...

7234
08:39:27,210 --> 08:39:29,510
I got the phase two though.

7235
08:39:32,220 --> 08:39:33,730
I got a phase two!

7236
08:39:41,140 --> 08:39:42,380
Oh, what the fuck?

7237
08:39:42,600 --> 08:39:43,300
Why did you jump?

7238
08:39:43,680 --> 08:39:44,680
What the fuck?

7239
08:39:50,240 --> 08:39:52,880
And what a phase two it was.

7240
08:39:55,680 --> 08:39:56,900
I'll just heal a little bit.

7241
08:40:00,660 --> 08:40:04,380
If you nailed down, if you hit nailed down, you would jump on it dealing more damage.

7242
08:40:04,600 --> 08:40:05,180
Is that true?

7243
08:40:06,200 --> 08:40:06,860
Do I have to hit?

7244
08:40:07,520 --> 08:40:07,880
Wait.

7245
08:40:09,200 --> 08:40:10,580
Am I pogo on him?

7246
08:40:15,880 --> 08:40:24,040

7247
08:40:33,190 --> 08:40:35,450

7249
08:41:07,610 --> 08:41:09,730
He's like, yes, I saw you.

7250
08:41:10,150 --> 08:41:11,750
I saw you said yes, too.

7251
08:41:12,770 --> 08:41:14,130
Don't think I did it.

7252
08:41:14,930 --> 08:41:16,390
Give him the same punishment.

7253
08:41:24,110 --> 08:41:25,890
Oh, what the fuck?

7254
08:41:39,200 --> 08:41:39,680
Alright.

7255
08:41:47,270 --> 08:41:48,350
Oh my god.

7256
08:41:51,490 --> 08:41:52,050
Alright.

7257
08:41:58,710 --> 08:41:59,270
Okay.

7258
08:42:00,250 --> 08:42:02,350
I went too early.

7259
08:42:17,250 --> 08:42:17,930
No!

7260
08:42:19,070 --> 08:42:20,410
The laser.

7261
08:42:25,480 --> 08:42:27,000
Are you serious?

7262
08:42:27,440 --> 08:42:28,140
I got...

7263
08:42:28,140 --> 08:42:30,820
Oh, he boxed me in.

7264
08:42:31,440 --> 08:42:33,920
She actually boxed me in.

7265
08:42:35,140 --> 08:42:36,260
Holy shit.

7266
08:42:36,980 --> 08:42:38,740
I feel like I'm getting the most unlucky.

7267
08:42:41,120 --> 08:42:43,000
I feel like I'm getting the most unlucky.

7268
08:42:43,020 --> 08:42:43,560
unlucky.

7269
08:42:44,440 --> 08:42:44,740
Shit ever.

7270
08:42:54,200 --> 08:42:55,860
The RNG is so unlucky.

7271
08:43:04,560 --> 08:43:09,200
It's very hard to heal in this, but sometimes this doesn't work.

7272
08:43:09,240 --> 08:43:12,140
I'm just not gonna do it when he gets done like that.

7273
08:43:15,460 --> 08:43:17,120
Like, what the fuck?

7274
08:43:20,200 --> 08:43:21,260
Leave me alone.

7275
08:43:24,780 --> 08:43:25,580
Oh, yeah.

7276
08:43:31,100 --> 08:43:36,420
It's just It's just too tight The The room to heal

7277
08:43:44,340 --> 08:43:46,920
Now I know why this is the hardest boss

7278
08:43:53,820 --> 08:43:56,080
Don't hit by me Oh

7279
08:44:02,440 --> 08:44:06,920
Oh of course that hits me Oh my god he's not even It's not done yet

7280
08:44:18,720 --> 08:44:19,940
Are you serious?

7281
08:44:22,100 --> 08:44:22,700
Get me out of here

7282
08:44:31,630 --> 08:44:33,430
It should be the yellow now.

7283
08:44:37,010 --> 08:44:41,230
It's just the fact that it's so RNG when she does.

7284
08:44:42,630 --> 08:44:42,990
Oh.

7285
08:44:44,410 --> 08:44:45,990
It's so RNG.

7286
08:44:48,510 --> 08:44:50,970
Like whatever moveset she decides to use.

7287
08:44:55,080 --> 08:44:55,380
Oh.

7288
08:44:55,740 --> 08:44:57,440
I thought that was...

7289
08:44:57,440 --> 08:44:58,740
That was close enough.

7290
08:45:01,620 --> 08:45:03,660
I hate these ones.

7291
08:45:07,660 --> 08:45:09,260
Of course that hits me!

7292
08:45:11,020 --> 08:45:13,740
I feel like I dodged everything, but I...

7293
08:45:13,740 --> 08:45:14,820
Ah, yes!

7294
08:45:18,020 --> 08:45:19,020
Please.

7295
08:45:19,900 --> 08:45:20,280
Please.

7296
08:45:33,610 --> 08:45:35,110
That's crazy.

7297
08:45:40,110 --> 08:45:40,630
Oh!

7298
08:45:41,870 --> 08:45:43,590
Oh, shit!

7299
08:45:44,290 --> 08:45:44,530
Oh!

7300
08:45:52,800 --> 08:45:54,720
Okay, that's not legal.

7301
08:45:55,880 --> 08:45:58,200
That shouldn't be legal.

7302
08:45:59,800 --> 08:46:02,080
That actually shouldn't be legal.

7303
08:46:03,160 --> 08:46:06,200
What she just did there.

7304
08:46:10,200 --> 08:46:11,580
Holy shit!

7305
08:46:12,360 --> 08:46:16,580
This would be if I'm getting the worst RNG possible.

7306
08:46:27,120 --> 08:46:28,000
Did I hit me?

7307
08:46:28,060 --> 08:46:28,680
I can't tell.

7308
08:46:29,000 --> 08:46:31,600
I guess she hates me.

7309
08:46:32,120 --> 08:46:33,460
Bro, I hate her too.

7310
08:46:39,130 --> 08:46:40,650
I also hate her.

7311
08:46:42,930 --> 08:46:44,390
Don't worry.

7312
08:46:45,030 --> 08:46:46,890
Oh, and then she starts off.

7313
08:46:47,450 --> 08:46:47,450
Okay.

7314
08:46:48,090 --> 08:46:48,670
Don't worry.

7315
08:46:48,830 --> 08:46:50,090
I also hate her.

7316
08:47:10,430 --> 08:47:12,790
How many orbs was that?

7317
08:47:13,090 --> 08:47:25,020
chat how many orbs does she throw yes how many how many

7318
08:47:35,020 --> 08:47:40,860
that was cruel that was actually so cruel

7319
08:47:46,660 --> 08:47:50,120
okay i missed

7320
08:48:01,670 --> 08:48:04,930
I'm just gonna try and get to get out of this phase as fast as I can.

7321
08:48:06,150 --> 08:48:08,790
I need to stop using that when she's doing this.

7322
08:48:12,410 --> 08:48:15,270
Oh, well, looks fine.

7323
08:48:20,160 --> 08:48:20,680
There you go.

7324
08:48:22,040 --> 08:48:23,160
I don't know why I keep doing that.

7325
08:48:24,580 --> 08:48:25,940
It doesn't work for that.

7326
08:48:26,460 --> 08:48:27,420
I need to remember it.

7327
08:48:29,960 --> 08:48:31,500
Okay, and then I back up.

7328
08:48:32,160 --> 08:48:33,880
Because I don't want to get hit, but oh, I guess.

7329
08:48:33,900 --> 08:48:35,900
Okay, and then back up.

7330
08:48:45,670 --> 08:48:48,110
Should be close to...

7331
08:48:58,570 --> 08:48:59,590
Oh, that's fine.

7332
08:48:59,790 --> 08:49:00,650
I think it's close.

7333
08:49:02,690 --> 08:49:04,070
He almost has no HP.

7334
08:49:07,790 --> 08:49:08,410
Come on, yell.

7335
08:49:08,870 --> 08:49:09,410
There you go.

7336
08:49:10,890 --> 08:49:12,690
Oh, I could tell when they're...

7337
08:49:16,850 --> 08:49:17,970
There you go.

7338
08:49:21,470 --> 08:49:26,120
There is no way I am dodging in time with the fucking slug, and you guys know it.

7339
08:49:40,740 --> 08:49:42,260
She hates me.

7340
08:49:42,800 --> 08:49:44,240
She knows that that's okay.

7341
08:49:44,460 --> 08:49:45,460
I hate her too.

7342
08:49:57,470 --> 08:49:58,610
Oh my god.

7343
08:49:59,610 --> 08:50:01,810
I just didn't have time to react there.

7344
08:50:05,230 --> 08:50:06,170
And again.

7345
08:50:07,810 --> 08:50:08,390
And again.

7346
08:50:09,490 --> 08:50:10,170
And again.

7347
08:50:10,510 --> 08:50:11,110
That's fine.

7348
08:50:15,060 --> 08:50:16,740
And again, that's fine.

7349
08:50:17,620 --> 08:50:18,140
And again.

7350
08:50:20,840 --> 08:50:22,320
Oh, and then, oh, spikes.

7351
08:50:22,480 --> 08:50:22,860
There we go.

7352
08:50:23,140 --> 08:50:23,600
That's fine.

7353
08:50:29,160 --> 08:50:30,160
Oh, and again.

7354
08:50:30,680 --> 08:50:32,060
Okay, oh, and...

7355
08:50:34,600 --> 08:50:35,560
Give me a sec.

7356
08:50:35,780 --> 08:50:36,980
I'm gonna...

7357
08:50:36,980 --> 08:50:38,000
Oh, I need angry peed.

7358
08:51:51,880 --> 08:51:53,060
I'm done angry peed.

7359
08:51:54,740 --> 08:51:55,780
Many of that.

7360
08:51:55,840 --> 08:51:56,880
Thank you, Super Chat.

7361
08:51:56,980 --> 08:51:58,180
Thank you, thank you.

7362
08:51:59,700 --> 08:52:01,200
I'm done angry peeing.

7363
08:52:06,950 --> 08:52:07,950
Oh my god.

7364
08:52:19,610 --> 08:52:21,690
She's actually only using Orbs on.

7365
08:52:21,850 --> 08:52:23,350
Like, I swear to God.

7366
08:52:24,990 --> 08:52:26,290
She's input reading me.

7367
08:52:26,330 --> 08:52:27,070
Because she knows.

7368
08:52:27,210 --> 08:52:29,290
She knows how much I fucking hate that move.

7369
08:52:30,530 --> 08:52:31,130
I swear.

7370
08:52:31,310 --> 08:52:32,650
She is input reading me.

7371
08:52:33,190 --> 08:52:35,830
I refuse to believe anything else.

7372
08:52:44,810 --> 08:52:45,070
Oh.

7373
08:52:45,330 --> 08:52:45,970
That's unlucky.

7374
08:52:46,630 --> 08:52:47,070
Doesn't.

7375
08:53:01,490 --> 08:53:01,890
Okay.

7376
08:53:03,690 --> 08:53:04,550
Cheating it.

7377
08:53:04,650 --> 08:53:04,810
Alright.

7378
08:53:07,390 --> 08:53:09,590
Okay, and then I don't want him to headbutton me.

7379
08:53:12,210 --> 08:53:12,230
Oh!

7380
08:53:15,470 --> 08:53:16,950
Uh, nice read.

7381
08:53:17,850 --> 08:53:19,470
Now they're all input reading me.

7382
08:53:27,680 --> 08:53:29,080
Oh, stupid headbutt.

7383
08:53:30,240 --> 08:53:31,000
Oh my god.

7384
08:53:31,100 --> 08:53:32,400
Wait, I might die to this moon.

7385
08:53:35,200 --> 08:53:36,760
I'm rushing it a lot.

7386
08:53:38,600 --> 08:53:40,100
Yeah, I'm going to die to this one.

7387
08:53:43,500 --> 08:53:43,660
Ah.

7388
08:53:44,780 --> 08:53:45,920
I rushed that.

7389
08:53:46,160 --> 08:53:46,920
I was impatient.

7390
08:53:48,020 --> 08:53:49,280
I was impatient there.

7391
08:53:58,080 --> 08:53:58,980
I got toe-hoed.

7392
08:53:59,160 --> 08:54:00,300
I knew I was going to get toe-hoed.

7393
08:54:03,740 --> 08:54:05,020
I can't help it.

7394
08:54:09,490 --> 08:54:10,950
I can't help it.

7395
08:54:11,010 --> 08:54:13,950
I just want to get reach-beated all the time.

7396
08:54:27,110 --> 08:54:27,590
Okay.

7397
08:54:27,850 --> 08:54:29,990
I think that one was a bit boring.

7398
08:54:30,010 --> 08:54:39,930
shit because like his y'all stalked me while i'm trying to like what the fuck was i supposed to do there

7402
08:55:59,700 --> 08:56:04,020
hit unlucky

7403
08:56:12,920 --> 08:56:15,100
all right this is where he's stabs himself.

7404
08:56:15,660 --> 08:56:16,380
So I can do this.

7405
08:56:18,420 --> 08:56:19,340
I can do this again.

7406
08:56:19,520 --> 08:56:23,380
And then I can heal one bite before he head-spots me.

7407
08:56:23,980 --> 08:56:25,300
I just don't want to get head-butted.

7408
08:56:41,400 --> 08:56:42,960
Is that true?

7409
08:56:43,760 --> 08:56:46,520
Using magic in the beginning makes it more aggressive?

7410
08:56:46,860 --> 08:56:47,540
Is that true?

7411
08:56:52,980 --> 08:56:53,540
Nope.

7412
08:56:56,820 --> 08:56:58,980
I guess we'll never know.

7413
08:57:01,120 --> 08:57:25,740
so it's like oh my god i'm getting distracted oh i looked at chat sorry um it's like that you know when you put the when you uh when you do the left and right trigger on in pokemon so that the pokemon pokemon would catch the pokemon faster thank you thank you for the super chat stop what do you mean i was asking you guys if it's true because he super chatted it

7414
08:57:29,560 --> 08:57:31,660
That's why I asked if it was true!

7415
08:57:36,740 --> 08:57:37,680
Damn, Edgar.

7416
08:57:37,860 --> 08:57:38,420
I'm sorry.

7417
08:57:38,840 --> 08:57:40,060
Chad's calling you a liar.

7418
08:57:43,560 --> 08:57:44,580
Sorry, Edgar.

7419
08:57:44,860 --> 08:57:46,020
I guess I can't do it.

7420
08:57:46,180 --> 08:57:47,820
Because Chad called you a liar.

7421
08:57:51,240 --> 08:57:52,340
Try it.

7422
08:57:53,920 --> 08:57:54,840
Edgar, I can't.

7423
08:57:54,900 --> 08:57:57,100
You got downvoted by the chat.

7424
08:58:07,430 --> 08:58:14,910
Or like A-B, say, I'm, look, I'm, I'm going through a lot right now, so I'm not really paying attention anymore.

7425
08:58:15,510 --> 08:58:19,170
Oh my, I, who will pass him, because I'm reading chat.

7426
08:58:21,610 --> 08:58:23,430
I'm reading chat now.

7427
08:58:24,450 --> 08:58:25,490
While mid-fight.

7428
08:58:33,700 --> 08:58:35,680
I don't even remember what my build was.

7429
08:58:35,780 --> 08:58:36,780
It's been so long.

7430
08:58:37,500 --> 08:58:39,480
I've been fighting him for so long.

7431
08:58:41,120 --> 08:58:44,920
build was oh

7432
08:58:48,020 --> 08:58:52,060
a fucking court this is oh god

7433
08:58:56,120 --> 08:59:01,220
this goddamn stupid head

7434
08:59:05,270 --> 08:59:14,950

7435
08:59:20,260 --> 08:59:26,560
what the fuck holy shit okay okay are you done

7436
08:59:31,370 --> 08:59:33,070
What the fuck?

7437
08:59:36,740 --> 08:59:38,000
That was crazy.

7438
08:59:38,300 --> 08:59:40,140
Like, what the fuck did I see there?

7439
08:59:48,590 --> 08:59:50,750
Yeah, it was blocking forever.

7440
08:59:51,150 --> 08:59:52,670
This is the worst spot to be.

7441
08:59:53,210 --> 08:59:53,610
Honestly.

7442
08:59:58,620 --> 08:59:59,700
A fucking horse.

7443
09:00:05,540 --> 09:00:07,060
I'll just steal one more.

7444
09:00:07,980 --> 09:00:08,920
Just in case.

7445
09:00:15,540 --> 09:00:15,900
Whoops.

7446
09:00:21,660 --> 09:00:23,060
There we go.

7447
09:00:23,320 --> 09:00:26,660
Now we're back here.

7448
09:00:32,520 --> 09:00:33,320
Oh fuck.

7449
09:00:35,220 --> 09:00:37,960
Even though I mastered this phase, like I said.

7450
09:00:42,000 --> 09:00:43,400
It's literally...

7451
09:00:43,400 --> 09:00:43,800
Okay.

7452
09:00:57,270 --> 09:00:58,730
Oh, I don't even want...

7453
09:00:58,730 --> 09:01:00,230
I can't talk anymore.

7454
09:01:22,930 --> 09:01:23,310
Okay.

7455
09:01:25,990 --> 09:01:27,090
Oh my god, I was like, oh my god.

7456
09:01:27,110 --> 09:01:28,110
That's close.

7457
09:01:45,450 --> 09:01:45,810
Okay.

7458
09:01:49,850 --> 09:01:50,290
Okay.

7459
09:02:10,840 --> 09:02:12,700
Oh my god, I hate these.

7460
09:02:16,460 --> 09:02:18,420
I couldn't have another, I don't have another dash.

7461
09:02:31,760 --> 09:02:32,180
Oh.

7462
09:02:35,900 --> 09:02:36,600
Oh.

7463
09:02:41,160 --> 09:02:42,980
There's this phase though.

7464
09:02:52,840 --> 09:02:56,760
I have to dodge that shit, what the fuck?

7465
09:03:06,540 --> 09:03:08,080
Oh my god.

7466
09:03:14,170 --> 09:03:14,990
Oh my.

7467
09:03:15,450 --> 09:03:16,410
That's impossible.

7468
09:03:19,270 --> 09:03:20,070
Oh my god.

7469
09:03:20,970 --> 09:03:21,830
I got scared.

7470
09:03:29,340 --> 09:03:30,900
He spawned in front of me.

7471
09:03:30,960 --> 09:03:31,980
What can I say?

7472
09:03:32,600 --> 09:03:36,760
He spawned in front of me and sent out this goddamn, like, spikes.

7473
09:03:38,220 --> 09:03:40,340
I don't know if I could have dodged that.

7474
09:03:53,440 --> 09:03:53,960
Oh.

7475
09:03:54,240 --> 09:03:54,960
That's unlucky.

7476
09:03:55,040 --> 09:03:56,340
I got trapped in the corner.

7477
09:03:57,800 --> 09:03:58,760
I don't like being in the corner.

7478
09:04:07,890 --> 09:04:07,910
Hmm.

7479
09:04:09,630 --> 09:04:11,610
I need to remember I can only do one in there.

7480
09:04:13,010 --> 09:04:13,950
How could I...

7481
09:04:13,950 --> 09:04:15,430
How could I have dodged it?

7482
09:04:16,030 --> 09:04:17,090
When he spawned there.

7483
09:04:17,910 --> 09:04:19,190
That's fucking fine.

7484
09:04:29,980 --> 09:04:30,300
Hmm.

7485
09:04:31,540 --> 09:04:32,320
I need to...

7486
09:04:32,320 --> 09:04:32,840
Not...

7487
09:04:32,840 --> 09:04:34,400
I need to not rush that.

7488
09:04:39,380 --> 09:04:39,940
I'll heal.

7489
09:04:41,460 --> 09:04:42,380
Just coming out.

7490
09:04:45,540 --> 09:04:46,140
Okay.

7491
09:05:00,520 --> 09:05:01,120
Hit.

7492
09:05:05,420 --> 09:05:05,660
Alright.

7493
09:05:14,540 --> 09:05:15,120
Come on.

7494
09:05:18,780 --> 09:05:19,940
Oh, fuck.

7495
09:05:20,280 --> 09:05:21,240
Um, that's bad.

7496
09:05:21,820 --> 09:05:24,860
I have no power-ups.

7497
09:05:28,690 --> 09:05:30,730
Maybe I could get one hit, I think.

7498
09:05:31,570 --> 09:05:32,190
Okay, there you go.

7499
09:05:32,310 --> 09:05:33,010
Now I have it.

7500
09:05:37,440 --> 09:05:38,040
Okay.

7501
09:05:51,920 --> 09:05:52,460
What?

7502
09:05:54,760 --> 09:05:55,800
That's my bad.

7503
09:05:56,960 --> 09:05:58,910
I risked, I fucked that up.

7504
09:06:21,600 --> 09:06:22,100
Alright, okay.

7505
09:06:24,200 --> 09:06:25,060
Oh, okay.

7506
09:06:25,920 --> 09:06:27,300
Two, four, six, seven.

7507
09:06:27,440 --> 09:06:28,260
Okay, I have seven HP.

7508
09:06:29,300 --> 09:06:30,240
For this.

7509
09:06:36,150 --> 09:06:38,090
Just not gonna...

7510
09:06:40,430 --> 09:06:40,870
Okay.

7511
09:06:47,500 --> 09:06:48,560
I'm trying to free up.

7512
09:06:52,880 --> 09:06:53,320
Wait,

7513
09:06:58,390 --> 09:07:00,850
oh my, oh my god.

7514
09:07:11,360 --> 09:07:13,100
Don't poke up, but what about Eddie?

7515
09:07:13,620 --> 09:07:14,560
He told me to poke.

7516
09:07:14,720 --> 09:07:15,340
No, not Eddie.

7517
09:07:15,920 --> 09:07:16,000
Not Eddie.

7518
09:07:16,240 --> 09:07:17,100
What about that guy?

7519
09:07:17,340 --> 09:07:17,980
That's not Eddie.

7520
09:07:18,300 --> 09:07:20,820
Who was the guy that was like, you should poke up them.

7521
09:07:28,480 --> 09:07:28,920
Uh.

7522
09:07:30,980 --> 09:07:32,540
Oh, it gets rid of the spider.

7523
09:07:33,440 --> 09:07:35,020
Oh my god, sorry, I'm reading chat.

7524
09:07:35,380 --> 09:07:36,260
Sorry, I'm gonna read...

7525
09:07:36,260 --> 09:07:37,620
Ah, fuck it, let's just do it.

7526
09:07:37,940 --> 09:07:39,060
Let's just commit to it.

7527
09:07:39,260 --> 09:07:40,100
Fuck it, I don't really care.

7528
09:07:41,040 --> 09:07:42,320
Let's commit to it.

7529
09:07:44,580 --> 09:07:45,220
There we go.

7530
09:07:47,540 --> 09:07:48,860
Boogin is really high risk.

7531
09:07:49,560 --> 09:07:49,880
Okay.

7532
09:07:50,760 --> 09:07:52,160
Sorry, I'm like reading chat too.

7533
09:07:53,260 --> 09:07:53,580
Alright.

7534
09:07:55,240 --> 09:07:57,340
MJ, thank you for the magenta soup, buddy.

7535
09:07:57,480 --> 09:07:58,000
Thank you.

7536
09:07:59,120 --> 09:07:59,540
Alright.

7537
09:08:00,160 --> 09:08:00,820
It's fine.

7538
09:08:00,940 --> 09:08:01,640
The build is fine.

7539
09:08:01,680 --> 09:08:02,500
It's not the build.

7540
09:08:02,600 --> 09:08:02,960
issue.

7541
09:08:07,730 --> 09:08:09,610
It's not, I don't think it's a build issue.

7542
09:08:09,730 --> 09:08:11,650
I don't think we could do anything that's different.

7543
09:08:12,950 --> 09:08:13,290
Honestly.

7544
09:08:14,790 --> 09:08:16,990
Okay, no chat reading, no chat reading while we're fighting.

7545
09:08:24,070 --> 09:08:26,610
I realize whenever I reach chat, I like fumble it.

7546
09:08:27,110 --> 09:08:27,830
Like right now.

7547
09:08:29,450 --> 09:08:31,290
No chat reading when I'm fighting him.

7548
09:08:31,670 --> 09:08:32,210
I'm sorry.

7549
09:08:33,770 --> 09:08:38,530
I usually do when I'm fighting the bosses, but I want to get this over with.

7550
09:08:41,870 --> 09:08:49,130
I've been reading chat every time I fight bosses, but this is the one time where I'm like Okay, maybe I should stop reading the chat.

7551
09:08:49,370 --> 09:09:08,350
I'm doing I'm still reading chat by the way, but It's just happened Okay This is the one boss where I think I can't read chat I say as I I'm still reading chat every time you see me look right that's me

7552
09:09:14,080 --> 09:09:15,400
Oh, again.

7553
09:09:15,880 --> 09:09:16,060
Okay.

7554
09:09:17,260 --> 09:09:17,740
Again.

7555
09:09:18,080 --> 09:09:18,220
Alright.

7556
09:09:20,880 --> 09:09:22,100
Oh, my god.

7557
09:09:23,880 --> 09:09:24,460
And again.

7558
09:09:24,780 --> 09:09:25,060

09:09:38,980 --> 09:09:39,600
Alright.

7561
09:09:45,340 --> 09:09:45,940
Good.

7562
09:09:50,780 --> 09:09:52,280
Oh, I saw I had my dash.

7563
09:09:52,960 --> 09:09:53,520
That's unlucky.

7564
09:10:04,860 --> 09:10:05,860

7574
09:10:32,790 --> 09:10:35,350
No one would know that I'm...

7575
09:10:35,350 --> 09:10:37,210
We know now.

7576
09:10:37,450 --> 09:10:39,490

7652
09:18:50,850 --> 09:18:52,170
This is a wild...

7653
09:18:52,170 --> 09:18:53,950

7654
09:18:54,290 --> 09:18:55,090

7661
09:19:36,700 --> 09:19:38,040

09:19:38,340 --> 09:19:38,500

7663
09:19:44,960 --> 09:19:45,520
Okay.

7664
09:19:50,830 --> 09:19:53,270
Okay, because I know he's got a headbutt after that.

7665
09:20:06,650 --> 09:20:06,970
Alright.

7666
09:20:11,720 --> 09:20:12,560
That was short.

7667
09:20:18,900 --> 09:20:20,340
At least the music is fun.

7668
09:20:20,360 --> 09:20:21,300
to listen to.

7669
09:20:22,140 --> 09:20:22,800

Okay.

7673
09:20:53,140 --> 09:20:55,400
Now off to the other phase.

7674
09:20:55,740 --> 09:20:56,040

7680
09:21:31,410 --> 09:21:31,830
Oh, man.

7681
09:21:31,890 --> 09:21:33,850
I wish she was closer to me.

7682
09:21:49,370 --> 09:21:50,330
Oh my god.

7683
09:21:58,710 --> 09:21:59,990
I didn't know what to do there.

7684
09:22:01,130 --> 09:22:02,670
I don't know how to dodge that.

7685
09:22:12,500 --> 09:22:13,380
Oh, nice.

7686
09:22:14,540 --> 09:22:15,460
Okay, that's good.

7687
09:22:16,220 --> 09:22:18,780
Alright, that gives me not a lot of HP, but that's okay.

7688
09:22:20,180 --> 09:22:20,840
That's okay.

7689
09:22:23,280 --> 09:22:23,840

09:32:46,850 --> 09:32:47,530
Okay, that's good.

7774
09:32:48,630 --> 09:32:50,150

7775
09:32:51,310 --> 09:32:52,010
Oh, my God.

7776
09:32:52,150 --> 09:32:53,170
I couldn't praise the sun.

7777
09:32:54,250 --> 09:32:58,870
That, that, like, literally, that's, they set up, like, the perfect thing for me, too.

09:33:20,840 --> 09:33:21,500
Oh, my God.

7779
09:33:21,560 --> 09:33:22,840

09:33:23,320 --> 09:33:25,160

Alright.

7784
09:33:38,180 --> 09:33:39,220
That's cool.

7785
09:33:44,980 --> 09:33:46,040
That's cool.

7786
09:33:46,600 --> 09:33:47,000
Sure.

7787
09:33:48,100 --> 09:33:49,140
Sure, let's do this again.

7788
09:33:50,440 --> 09:33:51,220
I don't mind.

7789
09:34:00,970 --> 09:34:01,690
Okay.

7790
09:34:02,270 --> 09:34:03,190
There we go.

7791
09:34:04,030 --> 09:34:04,050
Oh!

7792
09:34:04,570 --> 09:34:05,790
Wait, I did no hit!

7793
09:34:06,810 --> 09:34:07,810
Let's go!

7794
09:34:08,010 --> 09:34:08,950
Praise the sun!

7795
09:34:10,650 --> 09:34:12,370
I actually did know it.

7796
09:34:12,550 --> 09:34:13,270
I don't know how.

7797
09:34:13,770 --> 09:34:14,910
I don't know, man.

7798
09:34:16,390 --> 09:34:17,370
I don't know.

7799
09:34:24,120 --> 09:34:25,780
Oh my god.

7800
09:34:30,330 --> 09:34:31,690
Oh my god.

7801
09:34:34,410 --> 09:34:35,710
I don't know if that hit him.

7802
09:34:36,910 --> 09:34:37,870
I can't tell.

7803
09:34:45,690 --> 09:34:46,770
Oh, fucking curse.

7804
09:34:48,770 --> 09:34:49,730
Where's that?

7805
09:34:50,590 --> 09:34:51,810
Oh, okay.

7806
09:34:53,530 --> 09:34:53,810
Okay.

7807
09:34:54,730 --> 09:34:56,010
Who's that coming from?

7808
09:34:57,290 --> 09:34:57,490
Okay.

7809
09:35:04,200 --> 09:35:05,400
I-

7810
09:35:10,500 --> 09:35:12,000
Who's that coming from?

7811
09:35:13,460 --> 09:35:14,440
Okay, cool.

7812
09:35:22,760 --> 09:35:24,800
That's actually the closest I've ever got.

7813
09:35:25,040 --> 09:35:25,920
And I did no hit.

7814
09:35:26,340 --> 09:35:28,340
I did no hit run too.

7815
09:35:28,820 --> 09:35:29,700
That was the closest.

7816
09:35:31,020 --> 09:35:32,760
I just gotta deal with this guy.

7817
09:35:33,020 --> 09:35:35,400
He looks different.

7818
09:35:48,320 --> 09:35:51,080
Let's do the fact that he doesn't look the same no more.

7819
09:35:53,200 --> 09:35:54,860
Even though that, like, fucks with me.

7820
09:36:15,010 --> 09:36:15,490
Alright.

7821
09:36:22,060 --> 09:36:23,700
Okay, you should do the stat.

7822
09:36:23,800 --> 09:36:24,180
Yeah, this.

7823
09:36:26,020 --> 09:36:26,980
Oh, what?

7824
09:36:28,120 --> 09:36:31,340
Okay, I don't know how that messed up.

7825
09:36:34,460 --> 09:36:36,500
That was a weird thing to mess up.

7826
09:36:43,350 --> 09:36:46,410
Okay, I know that that else I can also do that

7827
09:36:53,440 --> 09:36:58,360
It Oh, there we go

7828
09:37:03,320 --> 09:37:04,760
We're good

7829
09:37:22,880 --> 09:37:26,100
Okay All right

7830
09:37:31,070 --> 09:37:32,450
Get good

7831
09:37:35,590 --> 09:37:43,590
Oh my god, they didn't see that That was scary That was actually scary.

7832
09:37:45,230 --> 09:37:46,650
That was so cheeky.

7833
09:37:56,880 --> 09:37:58,240
Oh my gosh.

7834
09:37:58,620 --> 09:37:59,280
Okay, that's fine.

7835
09:38:00,240 --> 09:38:00,940
That's fine.

7836
09:38:03,420 --> 09:38:04,120
That's okay.

7837
09:38:10,380 --> 09:38:10,440
Oh.

7838
09:38:11,860 --> 09:38:12,720
That's fine.

7839
09:38:13,180 --> 09:38:14,040
That means I can heal.

7840
09:38:14,540 --> 09:38:16,460
Getting my Estes flask ready.

7841
09:38:19,820 --> 09:38:21,300
Phase two.

7842
09:38:21,700 --> 09:38:22,720
Yay!

7843
09:38:30,040 --> 09:38:31,620
I had a feeling.

7844
09:38:33,580 --> 09:38:35,960
I knew he was gonna do that.

7845
09:38:38,600 --> 09:38:40,600
Anyone that does, like, no hit run for this?

7846
09:38:41,220 --> 09:38:42,180
Okay, wild.

7847
09:38:42,540 --> 09:38:43,660
Stronger than me.

7848
09:38:53,500 --> 09:38:53,980
Okay.

7849
09:38:59,920 --> 09:39:00,840
There was... I couldn't.

7850
09:39:01,240 --> 09:39:03,260
He comboed me perfectly.

7851
09:39:04,040 --> 09:39:04,900
He comboed me.

7852
09:39:04,920 --> 09:39:06,280
so perfectly.

7853
09:39:08,280 --> 09:39:09,260
Oh, no, TikTok.

7854
09:39:10,280 --> 09:39:11,340
Oh, no, TikTok.

7855
09:39:13,260 --> 09:39:16,180
I didn't think I'd be playing Hollow Knight for nine hours.

7856
09:39:17,020 --> 09:39:19,360
But only because of this particular box.

7857
09:39:19,680 --> 09:39:23,360
I think the moment I figure her out, like, it'll be so fast.

7858
09:39:26,840 --> 09:39:28,920
Oh, sorry, I'm just...

7859
09:39:29,600 --> 09:39:31,460
Oh, what the fuck?

7860
09:39:32,160 --> 09:39:33,860
He's doing, like, all the weird shit.

7861
09:39:40,670 --> 09:39:41,790
There you go.

7862
09:39:42,550 --> 09:39:43,870
Why are you being weird?

7863
09:39:49,330 --> 09:39:50,110
There you go.

7864
09:39:54,930 --> 09:39:55,630
Oh, shit.

7865
09:39:55,930 --> 09:39:56,990
Why are you being weird?

7866
09:40:10,650 --> 09:40:12,730
Okay, now I'll do the...

7867
09:40:12,730 --> 09:40:13,830
This, and I'll just do this.

7868
09:40:19,040 --> 09:40:19,480
Alright.

7869
09:40:21,280 --> 09:40:21,840
Again.

7870
09:40:22,460 --> 09:40:23,400
Oh, my god!

7871
09:40:23,760 --> 09:40:24,800
Stupid headbutt!

7872
09:40:27,240 --> 09:40:28,540

Eh.

7877
09:41:39,690 --> 09:41:40,710
Oh, my God.

7878
09:41:45,410 --> 09:41:45,750
Eh.

7879
09:41:52,140 --> 09:41:53,400
That was my bad.

7880
09:41:54,620 --> 09:41:55,600
Are you serious?

7881
09:41:55,960 --> 09:41:57,040
Ah, my dash.

7882
09:41:58,500 --> 09:42:00,140
Yeah, I don't think I'm living through this.

7883
09:42:03,680 --> 09:42:05,400
I don't think I'm living through this one.

7884
09:42:06,680 --> 09:42:08,120
I messed up too many times.

7885
09:42:12,380 --> 09:42:12,960
There you go.

7886
09:42:13,760 --> 09:42:14,440
I don't know.

7887
09:42:14,720 --> 09:42:15,600
I don't know, Matt.

7888
09:42:18,020 --> 09:42:18,960
I don't know.

7889
09:42:23,740 --> 09:42:25,300
I didn't drink my Estes.

7890
09:42:34,730 --> 09:42:38,510
Oh my god, your stupid fucking orb shit!

7891
09:42:48,390 --> 09:42:50,050
Oh my god, and then she TP's to the other side.

7892
09:42:50,210 --> 09:42:51,390

7893
09:43:02,630 --> 09:43:04,590
I fucking, of course she did.

7894
09:43:05,610 --> 09:43:07,070
I fucking course she did.

7895
09:43:07,770 --> 09:43:10,330
TP near me, please, woman.

7896
09:43:12,710 --> 09:43:13,750
Call your loved ones.

7897
09:43:13,930 --> 09:43:15,310
We're not leaving here.

7898
09:43:16,690 --> 09:43:20,570
We thought we were gonna stay forever on the rock boy.

7899
09:43:20,770 --> 09:43:23,790
No, this is where we'll die.

7900
09:43:26,430 --> 09:43:28,090
Call your loved ones.

7901
09:43:28,310 --> 09:43:28,990
It's time.

7902
09:43:30,150 --> 09:43:32,390
Tell them you're not seeing home anymore.

7903
09:43:38,730 --> 09:43:41,690
That little jump though, when he does, it's so sad.

7904
09:43:46,010 --> 09:43:49,550
Oh my gosh, I'm actually, I should do, I'm gonna do a rerun of this.

7905
09:43:50,490 --> 09:43:51,990
Ah, fuck it.

7906
09:43:52,190 --> 09:43:55,010
Let's just see how, how far it takes us.

7907
09:44:00,840 --> 09:44:02,480
Might not be worth, yeah, it's not worth it.

7908
09:44:05,020 --> 09:44:06,320
That's not worth that.

7909
09:44:15,560 --> 09:44:34,460
I don't know why I'm hitting I'm hitting a ceiling on this one I'm hitting a wall on this every other boss like yes some of the bosses were hard but holy fuck this boss This boss is ridiculous.

7910
09:44:39,110 --> 09:44:42,690
This boss I'm actually struggling so hard.

7911
09:44:52,560 --> 09:44:54,300
There's something about him.

7912
09:44:55,000 --> 09:44:55,940
Or about her.

7913
09:44:58,120 --> 09:44:58,700
Did I do it?

7914
09:44:59,400 --> 09:45:01,020
No, it's this thing.

7915
09:45:04,080 --> 09:45:04,420
Okay.

7916
09:45:05,820 --> 09:45:07,440
Oh, that's unlucky.

7917
09:45:15,700 --> 09:45:16,580
Oh.

7918
09:45:16,600 --> 09:45:18,460
Didn't mean to hit that.

7919
09:45:42,480 --> 09:45:42,980
Hit.

7920
09:45:44,420 --> 09:45:45,320
Ground slam.

7921
09:45:49,290 --> 09:45:51,010
I think he's gonna...

7922
09:45:51,010 --> 09:45:51,730
Yeah, there he is.

7923
09:45:51,950 --> 09:45:53,230
I wasn't gonna use my magic.

7924
09:45:55,170 --> 09:45:55,590
Oh!

7925
09:45:58,190 --> 09:45:58,690
Oh!

7926
09:46:00,050 --> 09:46:01,210
Keep mistiming that one.

7927
09:46:01,470 --> 09:46:03,510
Okay, I can do two magic attacks here.

7928
09:46:05,490 --> 09:46:07,210
This is worse than grinding for top 5.

7929
09:46:07,330 --> 09:46:07,610
I don't know.

7930
09:46:07,870 --> 09:46:08,370
100%.

7931
09:46:36,560 --> 09:46:47,580
Oh my god that's so cheeky that's actually so cheeky holy shit I'm a little myth that he did that

7932
09:46:53,080 --> 09:46:55,300
that is actually bullshit

7933
09:47:03,580 --> 09:47:08,340
Oh my god oh my god he's actually like

7934
09:47:11,400 --> 09:47:12,800
He's toying with me.

7935
09:47:27,820 --> 09:47:28,720
I don't know if I have enough.

7936
09:47:28,820 --> 09:47:29,800
I don't have enough.

7937
09:47:30,560 --> 09:47:32,020
I only have enough for three.

7938
09:47:32,980 --> 09:47:34,120
That's so bad.

7939
09:47:35,320 --> 09:47:36,480
That's so bad.

7940
09:47:36,820 --> 09:47:38,120
I only have enough for three.

7941
09:47:48,870 --> 09:47:50,470
Oh, I thought that wasn't gonna hit.

7942
09:47:51,790 --> 09:47:52,890
That's so unlucky.

7943
09:48:12,420 --> 09:48:14,420
I don't know if I'm getting better or not.

7944
09:48:14,420 --> 09:48:23,180
phase two i can't tell i can't tell

7945
09:48:28,940 --> 09:48:46,200

7946
09:48:50,280 --> 09:48:51,040
That's right.

7947
09:48:52,640 --> 09:48:54,120
That's when you know I don't care.

7948
09:48:54,860 --> 09:48:56,540
You don't matter to me.

7949
09:48:58,420 --> 09:49:00,520
Not even a bot to remember your name.

7950
09:49:15,430 --> 09:49:15,670
Whoops.

7951
09:49:16,610 --> 09:49:18,270
I didn't think that was going to happen to me.

7952
09:49:18,810 --> 09:49:21,330
Actually, I'm just going to drink one, actually.

7953
09:49:22,410 --> 09:49:23,790
I feel like that's going to be appropriate.

7954
09:49:26,550 --> 09:49:26,830
Oh.

7955
09:49:28,790 --> 09:49:29,270
That's unlucky.

7956
09:49:30,570 --> 09:49:33,010
He didn't drink another one.

7957
09:49:48,350 --> 09:49:48,970
Okay.

7958
09:49:54,040 --> 09:49:54,660
Jesus.

7959
09:49:54,920 --> 09:49:55,060
Okay.

7960
09:50:01,290 --> 09:50:01,630
Nice.

7961
09:50:01,890 --> 09:50:06,950
Okay, I got, I got, uh, a few energy for that.

7962
09:50:09,890 --> 09:50:10,570
You're good.

7963
09:50:11,090 --> 09:50:14,310
Why can't you help me fight him too, so solid?

7964
09:50:26,500 --> 09:50:29,260
Honestly, he's not, okay, never mind.

7965
09:50:31,420 --> 09:50:35,560
I was gonna say, at least it's not the energy, what?

7966
09:50:37,140 --> 09:50:39,340
I spoke too soon.

7967
09:50:49,540 --> 09:50:50,620
Oh my god!

7968
09:51:11,990 --> 09:51:12,690
Yay!

7969
09:51:13,690 --> 09:51:14,310
Yay!

7970
09:51:17,290 --> 09:51:18,450
Okay, nice.

7971
09:51:22,470 --> 09:51:24,450
Oh, I get, like, one foot here.

7972
09:51:24,970 --> 09:51:25,610
Thank god.

7973
09:51:27,710 --> 09:51:28,490
Oh, oh.

7974
09:51:42,020 --> 09:51:43,420
Oh

7975
09:51:47,910 --> 09:51:50,250
It's not fair

7976
09:51:56,350 --> 09:51:59,450
Oh my god, wow, thank you for

7977
09:52:11,510 --> 09:52:14,190
letting me hit you one time.

7978
09:52:15,670 --> 09:52:17,370
What an honor.

7979
09:52:22,860 --> 09:52:25,060
Wow, thank you.

7980
09:52:32,230 --> 09:52:34,910
Oh my

7981
09:52:39,640 --> 09:52:40,120
god.

7982
09:53:07,160 --> 09:53:10,480
Not the balls.

7983
09:53:12,420 --> 09:53:14,060
That's it, I'm looking at my build.

7984
09:53:14,640 --> 09:53:18,560
I'm looking at my build.

7985
09:53:19,200 --> 09:53:19,480
Okay.

7986
09:53:21,720 --> 09:53:22,440
I can't.

7987
09:53:22,660 --> 09:53:25,160
Whoever fucking suggested me lie now.

7988
09:53:26,700 --> 09:53:28,120
I don't like it.

7989
09:53:36,520 --> 09:53:37,360
That's it.

7990
09:53:37,520 --> 09:53:39,280
I've actually finally looked at my build.

7991
09:53:39,500 --> 09:53:40,080
I can't.

7992
09:53:41,380 --> 09:53:43,180
I can't do it.

7993
09:53:43,780 --> 09:53:44,880
I can't anymore.

7994
09:54:03,420 --> 09:54:04,700
That's it.

7995
09:54:07,700 --> 09:54:09,140
We're doing this.

7996
09:54:09,900 --> 09:54:12,340
I'm done bashing my head against that wall.

7997
09:54:12,740 --> 09:54:13,260
Two hours.

7998
09:54:13,340 --> 09:54:14,380
I have two hours left.

7999
09:54:26,140 --> 09:54:26,860
Oh, whoops.

8000
09:54:35,130 --> 09:54:36,550
Does he even get hurt by this?

8001
09:54:36,690 --> 09:54:38,670
I can't

8002
09:54:43,690 --> 09:54:47,050
tell if he does, honestly.

8003
09:54:54,390 --> 09:54:56,150
I don't think he does.

8004
09:55:00,560 --> 09:55:03,560
Holy shit, he's having a fun time.

8005
09:55:03,780 --> 09:55:04,280
That's for sure.

8006
09:55:06,440 --> 09:55:07,800
I don't think he is.

8007
09:55:13,440 --> 09:55:15,480
Wait, is he actually getting hurt?

8008
09:55:15,660 --> 09:55:16,660
I can't tell.

8009
09:55:21,720 --> 09:55:23,880
Does he actually get hurt by it?

8010
09:55:27,670 --> 09:55:28,310
Stinky?

8011
09:55:31,290 --> 09:55:32,570
He doesn't?

8012
09:55:32,670 --> 09:55:33,450
Okay, but...

8013
09:55:34,670 --> 09:55:47,670
he is okay that's good enough for me I don't care if it does one damage that's good enough I don't care that's good enough for me

8014
09:55:54,030 --> 09:56:01,890
honestly one damage is good enough one is better than nothing

8015
09:56:07,640 --> 09:56:10,700
I don't even remember what I removed oh I nailed it

8016
09:56:18,770 --> 09:56:19,810
Oh, whoops.

8017
09:56:28,550 --> 09:56:30,010
Oh, what the fuck he jumped?

8018
09:56:35,830 --> 09:56:36,610
That was my bad.

8019
09:56:37,990 --> 09:56:39,030
I was trying to do that.

8020
09:56:39,970 --> 09:56:41,170
It's just out of reflex.

8021
09:56:45,920 --> 09:56:46,540
Drink this.

8022
09:56:46,660 --> 09:56:47,440
It's just...

8023
09:56:50,480 --> 09:56:51,000
Okay.

8024
09:57:06,080 --> 09:57:06,400
Okay.

8025
09:57:06,880 --> 09:57:08,000
No head buff for you.

8026
09:57:14,200 --> 09:57:14,720
Alright.

8027
09:57:16,760 --> 09:57:20,860
If I land in my aura, that's right.

8028
09:57:21,800 --> 09:57:22,820
Land in my aura.

8029
09:57:24,500 --> 09:57:24,860
Nice.

8030
09:57:25,620 --> 09:57:26,440
All right, see?

8031
09:57:29,820 --> 09:57:31,220
Land in it.

8032
09:57:41,770 --> 09:57:45,070
I don't know if she gets affected by it, but I'll try.

8033
09:57:47,250 --> 09:57:50,430
Please, can you come down so you can go into my aura?

8034
09:58:05,140 --> 09:58:08,020
Okay, that's good that she flew next to it.

8035
09:58:08,300 --> 09:58:09,980
Thank fucking god.

8036
09:58:25,660 --> 09:58:27,140
Oh, fuck, that's bad for me.

8037
09:58:38,440 --> 09:58:38,960
What is she?

8038
09:58:39,000 --> 09:58:39,800
You don't fuck it.

8039
09:58:41,260 --> 09:58:42,380
I knew...

8040
09:58:42,380 --> 09:58:43,160
I had enough.

8041
09:58:43,560 --> 09:58:44,640
I was like, fuck it.

8042
09:58:48,120 --> 09:58:49,720
Praise the sun.

8043
09:58:51,520 --> 09:58:52,980
Praise the sun.

8044
09:58:54,880 --> 09:58:56,500
Keep praising!

8045
09:59:04,510 --> 09:59:07,950
I just gotta keep praising the sun!

8046
09:59:17,720 --> 09:59:19,620
I got such good RNG.

8047
09:59:20,360 --> 09:59:21,860
Oh, and then I jinxed myself.

8048
09:59:22,260 --> 09:59:22,580
Peep.

8049
09:59:27,320 --> 09:59:28,160
What?

8050
09:59:29,180 --> 09:59:30,600
Oh my god.

8051
09:59:48,010 --> 09:59:48,390
Okay.

8052
09:59:49,130 --> 09:59:50,150
That's not fair.

8053
09:59:52,130 --> 09:59:53,170
That's not fair.

8054
10:00:02,930 --> 10:00:05,530
Oh my god.

8055
10:00:05,970 --> 10:00:08,630
I wasn't even trying for that one.

8056
10:00:09,070 --> 10:00:09,590
Oh shit.

8057
10:00:10,090 --> 10:00:10,650
Oh shit.

8058
10:00:11,470 --> 10:00:11,470
Attack.

8059
10:00:11,850 --> 10:00:12,370
Attack.

8060
10:00:12,530 --> 10:00:14,850
I didn't realize I had a quick time event.

8061
10:00:15,510 --> 10:00:17,210
I hit with my aura.

8062
10:00:18,010 --> 10:00:20,030
I did it with.

8063
10:00:20,590 --> 10:00:22,330
I wasn't even trying.

8064
10:00:23,110 --> 10:00:24,950
I did it with aura.

8065
10:00:32,270 --> 10:00:35,230
around because I was just so tired.

8066
10:00:35,510 --> 10:00:39,650
The power of aura.

8067
10:00:40,810 --> 10:00:42,670
Oh my god, I survived.

8068
10:00:43,890 --> 10:00:44,310
I can't.

8069
10:00:45,230 --> 10:00:48,790
I was gonna unequip it after this.

8070
10:00:51,010 --> 10:00:52,530
Praise the sun.

8071
10:00:54,130 --> 10:00:56,830
Praise the fucking sun.

8072
10:01:09,290 --> 10:01:11,610
Now I'm John Holland.

8073
10:01:11,990 --> 10:01:15,430
Now I'm John Dark Souls Knight.

8074
10:01:19,310 --> 10:01:21,810
Oh, stinky rage.

8075
10:01:22,010 --> 10:01:23,110
Thank you for the super chat.

8076
10:01:23,370 --> 10:01:24,250
Thank you.

8077
10:01:36,870 --> 10:01:41,090
Guess how many hours did he took that Radiance took me?

8078
10:01:44,050 --> 10:01:47,730
That was the best RNG I could ever get on Radiance.

8079
10:01:49,910 --> 10:01:51,590
Three hours.

8080
10:02:01,870 --> 10:02:03,990
Oh my god, we did it.

8081
10:02:04,170 --> 10:02:04,770
Oh, that one.

8082
10:02:05,030 --> 10:02:08,530
I don't know what the average time is in killing Radiance.

8083
10:02:08,710 --> 10:02:09,530
Was that bad?

8084
10:02:10,890 --> 10:02:12,670
I had the smoothest cell.

8085
10:02:13,030 --> 10:02:18,650
I swear, I felt like everything was so smooth until Radiance.

8086
10:02:19,390 --> 10:02:21,270
And then Radiance was where I...

8087
10:02:22,090 --> 10:02:23,590
I hit the wall.

8088
10:02:25,050 --> 10:02:25,570
Three out.

8089
10:02:25,630 --> 10:02:26,810
Oh, thank God.

8090
10:02:27,850 --> 10:02:28,890
It's normal.

8091
10:02:34,410 --> 10:02:35,870
Oh, my God.

8092
10:02:37,010 --> 10:02:38,430
That's all that mattered.

8093
10:02:38,570 --> 10:02:38,990
You're right.

8094
10:02:39,050 --> 10:02:39,830
I killed him.

8095
10:02:39,970 --> 10:02:40,310
That's all.

8096
10:02:40,590 --> 10:02:41,030
I swear.

8097
10:02:41,890 --> 10:02:44,030
I had, like, even the parkour.

8098
10:02:44,530 --> 10:02:46,070
It was not that difficult.

8099
10:02:47,390 --> 10:02:48,410
Oh, my God.

8100
10:02:48,810 --> 10:02:49,590
The parkour.

8101
10:02:49,750 --> 10:02:50,830
I felt like the parkour.

8102
10:02:51,050 --> 10:02:51,830
I, like, cruise through.

8103
10:02:52,090 --> 10:03:23,490
easily um i've only like struggled like in one or two spots but after like i figured like i figured it out it was so easy and then but this the radiance state phase two was actually so hard because he did not let me breathe once yeah i almost climbed died during the climb yeah jade thank you the super chat thank you no I'm ready for silk song.

8104
10:03:23,670 --> 10:03:25,210
I was not expecting it to.

8105
10:03:25,510 --> 10:03:28,990
Because tomorrow's sleeping dog stream is going to be a short stream.

8106
10:03:30,250 --> 10:03:31,790
Maybe like two hours.

8107
10:03:34,590 --> 10:03:35,150
Dream.

8108
10:03:36,590 --> 10:03:37,890
Oh my god.

8109
10:03:37,970 --> 10:03:39,250
Yeah, I didn't heal.

8110
10:03:39,430 --> 10:03:41,650
There was no time to heal.

8111
10:03:44,390 --> 10:03:44,850
Oh.

8112
10:03:46,650 --> 10:03:49,670
I felt like I was getting very unlucky with her RNG.

8113
10:03:50,230 --> 10:03:52,070
Her RNG was like...

8114
10:03:52,090 --> 10:04:20,090
like so bad it was so hard yeah oh it was so fucking hard no there was no time there i don't know what time there's no time no time to explain no time i was just very unlucky i'll think about it i think about path of pain after Silk Sign.

8115
10:04:22,910 --> 10:04:24,750
I'll think about it after.

8116
10:04:24,870 --> 10:04:28,010
I'm just happy I got the true ending.

8117
10:04:29,210 --> 10:04:33,510
It felt like a filler episode trying to get everything to even...

8118
10:04:33,510 --> 10:04:39,650
Like, I felt like the parkour was such a small segment out of everything.

8119
10:04:39,910 --> 10:04:42,370
I was, like, most worried about the parkour.

8120
10:04:42,970 --> 10:04:46,370
But in the end, it was everything else.

8121
10:04:46,530 --> 10:04:47,910
That was so...

8122
10:04:47,930 --> 10:04:56,010
high yeah it was actually everything else that was so difficult

8123
10:05:00,140 --> 10:06:22,700
oh i'm so happy i'm so happy i wasn't expecting that run to be to be the um to be the actual run 81 there we go there you go 22 hours for true ending oh my god i'm so happy it's over i'm gonna rest now thank you everyone thank you thank you everyone i'm so happy we beat we beat halloween night with the true ending you guys didn't think i could do it you're like you guys you but i i was determined i was so determined i never give up never give up I knew we could do it If I bash my head against the wall Hard enough and frequently enough Eventually the wall will start breaking If you brute force enough A hole will eventually appear And then I win I won't win And we did it with aura Chat We did it with aura That's my subinoshi.

8124
10:06:23,560 --> 10:06:24,640

8125
10:06:28,140 --> 10:06:30,540
Anyway, I'm gonna head off now.

8126
10:06:31,180 --> 10:06:34,880
Congratulations to anyone that has watched me for 10 hours straight.

As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

8130
10:06:44,720 --> 10:06:46,860
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

8131
10:06:47,040 --> 10:06:49,080
And if you suffer me, head to bed.

8132
10:06:49,780 --> 10:06:50,540
You deserve it.

8133
10:06:50,660 --> 10:06:52,400
