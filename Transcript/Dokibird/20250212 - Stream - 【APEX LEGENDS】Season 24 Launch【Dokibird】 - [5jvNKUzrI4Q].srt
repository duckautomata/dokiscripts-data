1
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,750
Oh, where am I?

2
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,930
Hello, everybody!

3
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,390
Oh, where am I?

4
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,350
Oh, there I am!

5
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,430
Okay, here we go.

6
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,190
Hello, everybody.

7
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,650
That's a little awkward.

8
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,490
It's like, where did I go?

9
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,570
Oh, it's been so long.

10
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,170
It's been so long.

11
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,670
I'm trying to remember what my sound settings were.

12
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,370
That's how long it's been.

13
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,050
I don't even remember what my sound settings were.

14
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,950
Okay, I think it was... I know, like, what my... I know what my...

15
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,010
My Marvel ride was sound settings, right?

16
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,790
Oh, that's awkward.

17
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,730
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,310
That's just a little awkward.

19
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,910
I don't... I don't remember how to play in first person.

20
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,410
Oh my god.

21
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,130
You account based on... Oh my god, it's like...

22
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,970
Even the game knows it's been a long time.

23
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,470
Even the game was like, alright, let me give you a tutorial on how all of this works.

24
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,130
It's so weird.

25
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,950
Oh, it can't be... Oh man, I haven't played in first person in a...

26
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,850
Wow, that's where the settings were?

27
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,290
And then the progression?

28
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,290
Whoa, wowie.

29
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,350
Okay, so... Oh, this is weird.

30
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,090
It's like... I take up the whole screen now.

31
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,710
Like, it's so tiny.

32
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,110
It's so tiny.

33
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,410
Everything is so weird.

34
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,170
Okay, let's go to the... So, they changed a lot of shit, apparently.

35
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,930
That's why I'm back, guys.

36
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,650
All I know is about the mistress.

37
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,850
Welcome home, cheater.

38
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,490
Oh my god.

39
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,890
My first person.

40
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,710
Oh my god.

41
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,910
Wait, did it reset my settings?

42
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,210
Is that how long I haven't played this game?

43
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,350
Give me a sec.

44
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,610
My settings are wrong.

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,210
What the fuck?

46
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,710
Okay, give me a sec.

47
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,070
Alright, let's see.

48
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,670
Oh my god, I haven't played in so long that my settings aren't even mine anymore.

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,630
Oh my god, everything is reset.

50
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,570
I was like, wait a minute, this isn't right.

51
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,970
These settings aren't correct.

52
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,390
Wait a minute.

53
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,590
Okay, let's see.

54
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,270
Let me check if I have...

55
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,710
Oh man, I don't know.

56
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,690
Okay, I got... Okay, I don't even remember what my settings were.

57
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,830
I don't even remember.

58
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,450
Okay, it's like that, and then the bhop, and then...

59
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,250
Where's melee?

60
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,590
And... Wait, what was... Okay, that.

61
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,590
It was...

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,910
Change weapons.

63
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,370
Cycle weapons was this.

64
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,330
Yes, I think so.

65
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,270
Oh man.

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,990
Oh man.

67
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,070
Was that how I cycled?

68
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,170
Oh my god, give me... Guys, give me... It's not looking so good.

69
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:15,430
It's not... I'm trying to remember what my settings were.

70
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,910
I must have saved it somewhere.

71
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,630
Oh my god.

72
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,590
Okay, Apex settings.

73
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,370
I must have saved my keybinds somewhere, right?

74
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,130
Oh my god, there's no way I didn't save my keybinds.

75
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,950
I will be so sad.

76
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,630
I will actually... I don't remember.

77
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,090
I legitimately... I don't remember.

78
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,650
It's been so long.

79
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,010
I... I actually... What do I... What was my...

80
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,230
Did I use mouse bind for cycle weapon?

81
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,010
Oh my god, this is really bad.

82
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,590
This is... This is so bad.

83
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,130
Did I... Guys, guys, I'm... Guys, give me a sec.

84
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,650
I need a... I need a remember.

85
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,670
Okay.

86
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,190
Okay, I cycle... No, that's not...

87
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,590
That's the old one because I can tap strafe now.

88
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,510
So, okay, I think...

89
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,150
I think these are my settings.

90
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,450
I think... I think they're my settings because I don't talk to people.

91
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,410
Okay, let me make sure everything else is okay.

92
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,270
Let me make sure.

93
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,990
Okay, weapon, mini map.

94
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,110
Okay, on, ping.

95
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,790
Okay, enemy.

96
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,330
Oh my god.

97
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:26,950
Okay.

98
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,810
Okay.

99
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,530
Taking damage.

100
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,770
Okay, off, off.

101
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,570
I need to make sure everything I need is okay.

102
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,290
Okay, I think it's all... I think it's good now.

103
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,990
I think we are okay.

104
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,930
I don't know.

105
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,910
I don't know.

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,470
Everything is a blur right now, but I think everything will be okay.

107
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,490
Sound guy, I need you to know if the sound is okay because I don't know.

108
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,170
Okay, oh my god.

109
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,970
Am I... Okay, wait.

110
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,090
Wait, where's the... I'm at... Oh, wait.

111
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,290
Was I always at 100?

112
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,010
What's default, guys?

113
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,390
Guys, what's default?

114
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,850
Guys, what's the FOV default?

115
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,410
I can't remember.

116
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,730
What's the FOV default?

117
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,530
I need a... Was I on 100?

118
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,430
Have I always been on 100?

119
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,650
I don't remember.

120
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,610
I don't remember.

121
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,310
I actually don't.

122
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,010
Oh my god.

123
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,410
What's wrong with me?

124
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,550
I've played these games for so long.

125
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,390
How do I just not remember?

126
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:38,810
Okay.

127
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,850
Okay.

128
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,750
Okay.

129
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,410
Oh my god.

130
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,890
I forgot what it's like to shoot in first person.

131
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,270
It's crazy.

132
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,830
I have like almost... I think I have 2K hours in this game and then like... It's just that easy.

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,630
It feels so weird.

134
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,610
It feels so weird.

135
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,730
Did I actually... Yes, okay.

136
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,850
Okay, I did use this.

137
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,310
Like... Oh my god.

138
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,950
I don't remember what it was like to shoot in first person.

139
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,790
It's actually so weird to shoot in first person again.

140
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,750
Oh my god.

141
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,030
Okay, here we go.

142
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,030
Okay, I fixed all my settings.

143
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,630
Okay, I fixed all my settings.

144
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,310
It's been a while.

145
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,630
My settings reverted itself.

146
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,370
Oh my god.

147
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,690
We danced for so long.

148
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,890
I'm trying to...

149
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,350
Do you remember... Yeah, I still remember tap strafe, right?

150
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,210
Yeah, see?

151
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,550
That's tap strafing.

152
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,490
Look guys, I can tap strafe!

153
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,290
Wow!

154
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,630
That's 8K!

155
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,050
I can still do it!

156
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,210
I can still do it!

157
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,190
Wow!

158
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,070
I can still do it at least.

159
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,650
Okay, now the wall bounce.

160
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,190
What is this?

161
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,450
Like the Apex 101?

162
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,850
Okay, wait shit.

163
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,530
Okay, give me a sec.

164
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,310
I didn't have momentum.

165
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,730
There we go.

166
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,490
Wait a minute.

167
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,470
Wait a minute.

168
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,470
There we go.

169
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,230
Look at that.

170
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,350
Oh my god.

171
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,070
I'm back.

172
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,230
Boom!

173
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,270
I'm back.

174
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,730
Bhop, bhop's easy.

175
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,110
Look at that.

176
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,590
I still got it.

177
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,530
I still got it.

178
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,090
First try.

179
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,330
Oh my god, everything is so new.

180
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,850
It feels so close to me.

181
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,490
Like the training dummies feel so close.

182
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,150
They're like... I'm like, what are you doing here?

183
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,190
Why can't I see myself?

184
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,810
Okay, I don't know.

185
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,210
I think it's too loud, right?

186
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,730
Is the sound effects too loud?

187
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,470
Like, oh my god.

188
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,450
Like I said, I don't remember what my actual sound settings were for Apex.

189
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,710
It's been a while.

190
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,910
Check your scope and needs.

191
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:05,850
It's fine.

192
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:06,830
Everything is fine.

193
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,090
Okay, I heard the R9 is sort of back, but I don't know.

194
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,930
We'll see how I feel.

195
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,370
I don't know if it's actually back or not.

196
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,630
But they buff everything.

197
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,610
So like, what else did they change, guys?

198
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,810
I heard they buffed every gun possible.

199
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,470
So like, the Havoc is crazy fucking insane now, apparently.

200
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,910
Give me the Havoc.

201
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Like the damage.

202
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,800
And then like, they're rewarding headshots more, too.

203
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:55,460
You know, Apex has always had a thing where like, sometimes the settings revert itself if you don't touch the game in a very long time.

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,780
So like, that's me.

205
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,440
So I was just like, oh fuck, okay.

206
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,640
So my settings, when I was like using it, my settings were all different.

207
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,280
I was like, not different, but like, I was like, okay, these are default.

208
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,280
Because I have special settings for certain things.

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,460
So I was like, wait a minute, this is default.

210
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,060
Is the Kraber insta-kill?

211
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,760
This shreds so fucking hard.

212
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,460
Auto charge, right?

213
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,740
Yeah.

214
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,900
This is a care package weapon now.

215
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,280
I heard this is really strong, too, but...

216
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh my god!

217
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,320
What?!

218
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
Okay.

219
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,560
But I'm bad with this.

220
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm bad with the single fire.

221
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,360
But like, those who know how to play charge rifle is really good with single fire.

222
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,780
Okay, wait.

223
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,300
210?

224
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,900
It still doesn't insta-kill, unless I missed a headshot.

225
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,720
I could've missed a headshot, not gonna lie.

226
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,260
Yeah, 210?

227
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,940
That's... yeah.

228
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,440
I don't know.

229
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,200
I feel like, cause there's no helmet now.

230
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,300
There's no helmet now, so it still doesn't insta-kill.

231
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,940
I don't think it insta-kills.

232
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,660
Does it?

233
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,080
Yeah.

234
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh wait, but then they are wearing red armor.

235
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,840
Oh, that's true, I forgot.

236
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,860
They're wearing red, but there's no red armor anymore.

237
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,220
There's no red armor, I forgot about that.

238
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,320
So yeah, it insta-kills.

239
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,160
By the way, they removed red armor.

240
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,500
They removed red armor, and they also removed helmets, so like, headshots are worth more now.

241
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,900
So, I could do this and be like, haha.

242
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,900
I don't remember how I played with Bochek, but like...

243
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,060
Okay, nevermind.

244
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,380
No haha for me, I guess.

245
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,300
No, haha.

246
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,600
I guess I'll stop aiming for the head.

247
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,940
No haha.

248
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh my god, it's been so long since I played with Bochek.

249
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,140
Nevermind.

250
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,540
No hahas.

251
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,220
No.

252
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
No hahas.

253
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,220
I don't remember what this is like.

254
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,900
Wait, is it cause I have 3x?

255
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,540
I'm not good with 3x.

256
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,430
Yeah, there we go.

257
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,690
I feel a lot better now.

258
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,910
I'm not good with the 3x.

259
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,050
Yeah, there we go.

260
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,410
Haha, there we go.

261
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,790
That's the old...

262
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,190
I'm better at...

263
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,750
It's actually really fucking weird.

264
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,070
I'm better at the Ironsight for Bochek than I am with the 3x.

265
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,210
Like...

266
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,710
I was like, what was it?

267
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,510
Oh yeah, I forgot.

268
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,190
Haha.

269
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,090
It's like that video where like, oh I forgot I'm white.

270
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,510
Haha.

271
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,170
It's like, oh I forgot.

272
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,090
I can't aim with 3x.

273
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,610
Haha.

274
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,070
I love that video.

275
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,150
That video is so funny.

276
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:51,710
I don't know.

277
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,970
It's so out of con...

278
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,690
It's from Boondocks and it's like...

279
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,490
It's so out of context.

280
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,910
But it's just so funny.

281
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,290
Oh, what video?

282
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,870
Oh, it's like...

283
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,890
It's a Boondocks video so like...

284
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,810
You guys can sort of tell what the...

285
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,490
It's like, wait a minute.

286
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,370
I'm white.

287
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:12,870
Haha.

288
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,170
I'm not white by the way.

289
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,250
But it's like, wait a minute.

290
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,470
I can't aim with 3x.

291
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:17,910
Haha.

292
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,590
I'm an Ironsight player.

293
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,410
That's such a good out of context video.

294
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,690
Alright, let's get into it.

295
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,470
Okay, guys.

296
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,090
Let's die on repeat until I figure out if I still like this game.

297
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,890
Let's figure out if I still like this game, guys.

298
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:53,200
Alright, it's been a hot minute since we played Apex Legends.

299
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,300
So...

300
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,000
No, we're not going straight into fucking rank.

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,600
Are you crazy?

302
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,920
Like...

303
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,620
We're not going straight into rank, guys.

304
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm not that crazy.

305
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,280
Um...

306
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,180
Really interesting.

307
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,660
Like I said, I haven't...

308
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,360
I haven't touched Apex in a hot minute.

309
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
So I am incredibly...

310
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,340
Uh...

311
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,420
Incredibly rusty and everything.

312
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
So it's gonna be interesting.

313
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,100
I am at the end of the...

314
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,020
Oh, that's cool.

315
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,060
My team is like right there.

316
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,500
To be fair, I don't even know...

317
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,880
I guess that's my SBMM.

318
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,840
What even are the meta legends anyway?

319
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,480
I guess like they got rid of shield meta, right?

320
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,300
Did it get rid of...

321
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,720
Um...

322
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,360
I heard the shield meta...

323
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,600
I mean, it is...

324
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,480
It is pretty...

325
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,560
Pretty much of a dog shit meta.

326
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,960
Um...

327
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,560
I don't know.

328
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,800
Let's try Ashe, I guess.

329
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,560
She can dash now, right?

330
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,360
They changed Ashe...

331
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,740
Uh...

332
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,760
For like her dash abilities, I believe.

333
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,840
So it'll be interesting to see.

334
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
Oh, invisible woman!

335
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,900
Pick invisible woman, Doki!

336
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,200
Yeah!

337
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,860
Okay, let's see what...

338
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,960
What are my things?

339
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,560
Gain a phase breach charge.

340
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,940
Our snare is triple and can catch them all.

341
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,820
Gain a phase breach charge?

342
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,700
What the fuck is a phase...

343
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:20,980
Oh!

344
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
Gain a dash charge.

345
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,780
I guess I should try...

346
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,480
What the fuck is phase breach?

347
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm just like...

348
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,080
What the fuck are all these...

349
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,580
Turrets!

350
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,280
Oh, great!

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,200
My...

352
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,660
No gun.

353
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,980
Cool.

354
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,940
Alright.

355
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,320
Sorry, buddy.

356
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,700
I don't have a gun.

357
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,100
Okay, I can...

358
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,920
I got a gun now.

359
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,680
I'm coming back.

360
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,740
I'm coming back to help them.

361
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,780
Okay, so shift is the dash.

362
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,580
Okay, that's good to know.

363
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,640
Alright, hey guys!

364
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm here to help now.

365
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,460
Oh my god!

366
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,140
What the fuck!

367
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,860
Okay, it's jump.

368
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,320
It's jump.

369
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,640
Okay.

370
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
You can't bhop.

371
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
Okay, I just realized.

372
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,860
Bhopping is bad.

373
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,300
Okay.

374
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,140
Bhopping is...

375
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,920
Oh my god, you can't bhop on her.

376
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
You cannot bhop on her.

377
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,560
I just realized that.

378
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,320
If you bhop on her, you use your dash accidentally.

379
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,380
Wait, what?

380
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,130
Oh.

381
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,670
Okay.

382
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,410
Where is she?

383
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,650
Oh shit!

384
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,050
No!

385
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,220
Yeah, so like, the jump is her dash.

386
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,800
No!

387
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,100
Not the third party!

388
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,740
Oh, I live.

389
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,540
I live that.

390
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,200
When you kill someone, they die!

391
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
It's okay.

392
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,100
I'm not last.

393
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,700
At least I'm not the last squad.

394
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,240
It feels good to be back.

395
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,760
I forgot about the third party.

396
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,360
Okay, so what I learned is that...

397
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,260
That's...

398
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,160
Oh, I don't know about it.

399
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't like that the dash is on the jump.

400
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,520
There's only six other players.

401
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,440
Where's Luna Snow?

402
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,940
Where is she?

403
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,060
Oh my god.

404
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,580
The Apex Iroh.

405
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,940
Where's Mayu?

406
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,360
I know she doesn't read and gets baited.

407
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,300
Thank you for the super chat.

408
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,780
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,400
Goldenhelm.

410
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,180
Thank you for the super chat.

411
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,840
Thank you, thank you.

412
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,400
These are Doki Bird settings from four years ago.

413
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,520
Thank you for the super chat.

414
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:48,780
Thank you.

415
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,020
Okay, let me read the patch notes.

416
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,480
Fuck this.

417
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm reading the patch notes.

418
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,300
I...

419
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,480
I was like...

420
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,400
I was like...

421
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,740
Wait, the dash is on my jump button?

422
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,700
I was not ready for that.

423
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,160
I was like...

424
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,520
Wait a minute.

425
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,760
What is this?

426
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:13,380
Okay, there's the combat reserve, the stone reload, automatic reloads, weapon muscle flash is better now.

427
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,440
And then...

428
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,020
Why is...

429
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,560
Why am I not in my game yet?

430
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,420
The season just started!

431
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,360
Where's my game?

432
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay, now I got it.

433
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,040
I was gonna say...

434
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,220
How has it taken me 80 years to queue up a game?

435
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,340
It just started.

436
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,800
Alright.

437
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,740
Okay.

438
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
Oh my god.

439
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,360
Anyway.

440
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,740
Okay, now my average is going...

441
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,320
Slowly going...

442
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,280
I'm slowly becoming an average player.

443
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,800
No, that...

444
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,780
No, that makes sense.

445
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,060
That's justifiable.

446
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,320
The last time I played Apex was the last time I streamed Apex.

447
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,240
So, whenever that was...

448
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,840
Okay, station...

449
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,380
Okay, healing cells now take 2.5 seconds to complete.

450
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh!

451
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,400
Wait, healing is faster now too?

452
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,640
Oh!

453
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,680
Healing is faster now.

454
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,080
I know about the arsenal thing.

455
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,040
They got rid of helmets.

456
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
I know about that.

457
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,760
And then...

458
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,540
What is it?

459
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,560
We worked into gold armor upgrade...

460
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,700
Okay, gold helmet improves healing.

461
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,400
POI names.

462
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
Knockdown stat.

463
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,240
Significant increased crawl speed while knocked down.

464
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,260
Hand points have been removed.

465
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,780
Okay, there's no...

466
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,260
1x holo has been removed.

467
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,060
They buffed every fucking gun possible.

468
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,640
Every gun is buffed.

469
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,700
Okay, there you go.

470
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,660
I just see like a list of gun choices and it's...

471
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,440
Oh, it's just us two?

472
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,900
Alright, that's cool.

473
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,020
Like, just fuck me, I guess.

474
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,740
Alright, Ashe.

475
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,040
Remove the ability to scan death boxes.

476
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,180
Okay, jump key while in the air to perform a dash.

477
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,080
I hate that.

478
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,820
I hate that it's on my jump key.

479
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,860
Cause that's my...

480
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,240
Cause then it fucks up with my bunny hopping too.

481
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,760
So, I don't like that.

482
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,160
I don't... I never...

483
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,840
I don't like that dash is on the jump.

484
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,440
Just cause like my bunny hop is also on jump.

485
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,520
Cool.

486
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,060
I don't know if I like the names.

487
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,900
I don't know.

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,360
It really ruins my immersion when I can see the fuck giant ass names in front of me.

489
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,460
I don't know.

490
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,240
They're like, yeah, but it's help...

491
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm not gonna lie.

492
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,060
They're like, it helps the new players.

493
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,860
And I'm like...

494
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,840
They can press...

495
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,820
They can press M.

496
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,160
I don't know.

497
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,560
I just think they can just press M.

498
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,860
That's just my opinion.

499
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Ah, fuck!

500
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,080
Okay.

501
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,040
I hate that.

502
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,980
I hate that my dash is on my jump.

503
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,740
I don't know.

504
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,220
I just think it clutters it up, IMO.

505
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,900
It just looks way too cluttered.

506
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,180
For me.

507
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,220
I don't wanna press M.

508
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,420
Then you deserve the rank you have!

509
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,120
If you can't press M, you deserve the rank you have!

510
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Go!

511
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,500
Go in!

512
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,000
You're raked!

513
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,480
Go in!

514
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,740
I'm not!

515
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,060
Oh my god.

516
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,840
Trying to make sure...

517
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,480
Do I have Q?

518
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm surprised nobody is running at us.

519
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,260
I forgot.

520
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,400
I forgot other teams have, like, three players.

521
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,560
We have one.

522
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,440
Or we have two.

523
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,920
Alright, let's get...

524
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,700
Let's go in.

525
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,000
So mean!

526
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,180
I'm gonna go in and die!

527
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,800
I thought there was a guy here.

528
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,720
What happened to him?

529
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,720
I don't have any more ammos.

530
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm gonna press this.

531
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,260
I'm a little scared to go in.

532
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,600
They have three of them.

533
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,880
And then it's just us two.

534
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I feel a little scared, buddy.

535
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,100
Ah!

536
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,700
I hate that jump.

537
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,720
I really do.

538
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm not a fan of that.

539
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,120
How many dashes do I have?

540
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,060
Okay, it's a charge.

541
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,500
Okay.

542
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,240
At least now I know.

543
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm just not a fan of the...

544
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm just not a fan of the dash jump scare.

545
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,620
I don't know.

546
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,800
I feel like dash should not be on jump.

547
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,200
But that's just my opinion.

548
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,440
Oh my god, it's throwing me off so much.

549
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,160
It actually is throwing me off.

550
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,300
Wait, where?

551
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,280
What are you looking at?

552
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,660
Oh.

553
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,480
She's above me.

554
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,320
Gonna drop down?

555
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,650
Oh.

556
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,600
No!

557
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,760
No!

558
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,090
Oh, make sure you die.

559
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,670
If that's the last thing I do.

560
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,590
Oh shit.

561
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,470
Oh, that guy's a cringe player.

562
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,710
Oh my god.

563
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,330
I can tell you're fucking cringe.

564
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,130
I can tell.

565
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,910
I can tell.

566
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,430
I can...

567
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,910
Oh man, now I know how people play.

568
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,630
I know how people play Ashe.

569
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,470
Now I know.

570
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,650
Now I know.

571
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,730
I know how the Ashe players play now.

572
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,370
Now I know what it's for.

573
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,670
I seen like the mini, the micro hops.

574
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,150
And I was like, you know, you deserve that.

575
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,110
You know what?

576
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:13,350
Yeah.

577
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,390
Fucking...

578
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,610
I hope that micro bunny hop saves your fucking ass.

579
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,990
Oh, it did it?

580
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,970
Oh, wow.

581
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,230
Too bad for you.

582
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,130
Oh my god.

583
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,590
Jesus.

584
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,530
Okay, now I know how Ashe is played.

585
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,430
Oh man.

586
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,290
Wow, it didn't save you?

587
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,850
Who would've fucking thought?

588
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,350
Holy shit.

589
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,290
I just see the Ashe doing like 360 hops and everywhere.

590
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,290
This is the toxic doki I've missed.

591
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,180
It's literally my second game and I had to deal with...

592
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,980
I had to deal with cringe.

593
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,080
Oh my god.

594
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,410
It's so weird because it's like...

595
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:13,220
The new update definitely makes Apex much more faster paced now.

596
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,180
So you can tell I'm like...

597
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
For people who are newer at the game, you guys might not notice it.

598
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,700
Because for you guys, what I do seems really fast.

599
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,100
But for more experienced Apex players, people can notice that I'm playing really slow right now.

600
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,380
Because I'm like trying to remember...

601
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,340
I'm like literally just trying to remember how to play.

602
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,420
I'm like trying to remember what my buttons were.

603
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,840
Because I'm like slowly trying to figure it out.

604
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,620
Yeah.

605
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,180
I know I'm playing slow because I'm like...

606
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
What am I trying to...

607
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,920
What guns do I want to play with?

608
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,400
And I'm like...

609
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
Where were my buttons again?

610
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,000
You can hear the gears are just turning in my head.

611
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,820
And just like trying to be like...

612
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,960
I have to do this and that.

613
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,130
I know Ashe is very good for movement players.

614
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,070
For sure.

615
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,610
I would agree that Ashe is like...

616
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,970
I don't know if I like the names thing.

617
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,290
Because like...

618
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,670
It just feels so cluttered for me.

619
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,650
Yeah, they brought back tap strafing.

620
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,930
All the people were complaining about the tap strafing thing.

621
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,290
And then like...

622
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,970
And then they brought it back because like...

623
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,830
They were worried that the game was going to die even more.

624
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,950
I think competitively, Apex is fine.

625
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,110
But like...

626
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,690
Like...

627
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,650
But like...

628
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,030
Apex cannot be propped up by just competitive play.

629
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,310
I just think like...

630
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,850
Competitively, the game is fine.

631
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,110
But like...

632
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,470
Hub-wise, it's not.

633
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,490
But for the casual player base, it is absolutely not okay.

634
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,670
Woah.

635
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,250
Please leave me alone.

636
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,790
I'm just a little guy.

637
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,950
Nice.

638
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,350
Jesus Christ.

639
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,630
I forgot I was Wraith there.

640
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,770
I forgot I was Wraith.

641
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,430
I was just like...

642
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,610
I was just like...

643
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,790
Why is my Q not working?

644
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,970
I was trying to Q the door.

645
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,930
Okay, let me...

646
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,230
Okay, let me...

647
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,550
She'll...

648
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,590
She'll sell healing so fast now.

649
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,630
She'll...

650
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,390
I hope my guy is okay.

651
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,670
But I don't think he is.

652
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,710
You're fine, right?

653
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,290
Oh!

654
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,210
No!

655
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,470
Don't hold your shield up!

656
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,210
What do you mean?!

657
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,250
You don't even...

658
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,470
It's one button!

659
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,830
It's one button, Irishman!

660
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,410
You can't even hold your shield up!

661
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,430
Bro!

662
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,990
It's one fucking button!

663
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,310
I feel that.

664
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,350
Legitimately!

665
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,250
All you had to do!

666
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,430
Oh, that's the turkey we love.

667
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,650
I'm just saying he couldn't even...

668
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,330
I literally...

669
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,710
My entire plan was to use him as cover and he couldn't even give me that.

670
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,690
He couldn't even give me my cover.

671
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,530
I have to...

672
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,370
Jesus Christ.

673
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,550
Legitimately!

674
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,610
One button!

675
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,350
And then I would've been okay.

676
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,170
Oh my God.

677
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,950
His button can't be broken!

678
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,470
Cause you know what that button is?

679
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,030
It's the shooting button!

680
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,650
You can't say his button was broken!

681
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,910
It's literally the button to shoot your gun!

682
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,450
You think I don't know that?

683
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,030
Jesus Christ.

684
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,070
Okay, is that the arsenal?

685
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,810
Okay, I'm gonna keep the Prowler I guess.

686
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,150
How do I do this?

687
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,030
Oh, to enhance power?

688
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,390
Oh shit, did I enhance it?

689
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,510
Did I do it?

690
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,830
Nice.

691
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,830
Cool.

692
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,970
Okay, and then you can get Hemlock.

693
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,270
I'm gonna keep the...

694
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,210
Should I keep the Prowler or the Flatline?

695
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,870
I don't know.

696
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,230
Let's see.

697
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,870
Did you see him shoot?

698
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,710
Yeah, he got someone down!

699
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,830
I saw that guy!

700
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,730
I don't know if I wanna do Prowler.

701
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,790
I don't know if I wanna do Prowler.

702
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,070
I think you just like click on it.

703
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,990
That's really it.

704
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,090
There's really nothing else.

705
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,310
I want an R9!

706
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,330
Where's my R9?

707
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,210
Is there no R9s anywhere?

708
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,190
The fuck is this?

709
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,010
It came out of the fucking thing and there's no R9?

710
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,130
Where's my fucking R9?

711
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,610
That's my entire life mission!

712
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,510
Fuck it.

713
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,670
Oh, we'll just grab that.

714
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,460
Have we tried a new charge rifle?

715
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,720
I fucking hate charge rifle.

716
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,040
I hate the charge up for it.

717
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,040
At least we got the...

718
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,740
Yeah, with no attachments though.

719
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,880
There's so...

720
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,060
Wait, the icons are different now too.

721
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,060
I just noticed that.

722
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,000
There's like...

723
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,700
I guess those are arsenal icons.

724
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,820
I'm pretty sure.

725
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,240
Oh, this guy wants to fight.

726
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,020
Where's my beloved R9?

727
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,240
That's the whole reason why I was so happy to try out the new changes.

728
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,620
That's the only reason.

729
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,460
I just want the R9.

730
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,840
Oh, that's awkward.

731
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,240
Oh, that's awkward, buddy.

732
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,260
That's so awkward.

733
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,480
Wait, where's my...

734
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,760
Where's the res beacon anyway?

735
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,760
Let's see.

736
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,580
I know I'm trying to figure out where to reboot.

737
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,220
There's no reboot over there.

738
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,480
So I'm gonna go...

739
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,760
I'm gonna go over here to reboot.

740
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,540
Let's see.

741
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,340
I wanna fight team there.

742
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:27,880
Okay.

743
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,540
Alright.

744
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,260
He wants to fight the team here.

745
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,220
Okay.

746
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,300
Oh.

747
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,220
Okay.

748
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,580
Well, guess we're not fighting this team here.

749
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,180
Okay.

750
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,140
I was like, alright, I'll do that.

751
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,700
I guess I won't do that then.

752
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,080
I'll reboot him in the storm.

753
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,180
Fuck it.

754
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,660
Alright.

755
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,400
They're gonna chase us, so you get out your fight regardless.

756
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,800
And I grab this too.

757
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,000
Alright.

758
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,360
So about that fight you wanted.

759
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,280
So about that fight.

760
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,180
They're here.

761
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,580
There you go.

762
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,780
Wait, what?

763
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,380
How's there more people?

764
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,580
He like knocked somebody.

765
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,240
Do I have enough heals?

766
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:33,840
I do.

767
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,600
Okay.

768
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm trying to see where they are.

769
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,260
Jesus Christ.

770
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,000
He's one.

771
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,200
Alright.

772
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,520
Oh, he left.

773
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:48,960
Okay.

774
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,160
Hey, at least he got his fight.

775
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:51,740
Right?

776
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,440
That's what he wanted.

777
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,420
I'm just gonna grab some fucking heal- I need this 3x, Jesus Christ.

778
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,480
Alright.

779
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,320
Alright.

780
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm picking you up, buddy.

781
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm picking you up again.

782
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,640
Alright.

783
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,360
Alright.

784
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,020
Let's- Do I have enough heals for this though?

785
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,880
That's the thing.

786
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,740
I don't know if I have enough heals.

787
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,900
Oh wait, there's more heals here.

788
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,860
Okay, I do.

789
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,580
Alright, I guess- Let me grab some heals real fast.

790
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,140
Ooh!

791
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,060
Nice.

792
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,480
Yummy.

793
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,600
I'll take these.

794
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,880
Ooh, yummy.

795
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,280
Oh my gosh, so yummy.

796
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,660
Oh!

797
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,380
Oh my god, it's my birthday!

798
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,980
Alright, let's see.

799
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,920
18 syringes.

800
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll go pick him up right now here.

801
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,400
I'll go Res him right here.

802
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,680
It's 18 syringes, so like, that's fine.

803
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,860
Oh wait, there's more.

804
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,820
More yummy.

805
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,700
Okay, I can Res him in a minute.

806
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,740
I'll be fine.

807
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,700
Holy shit, there's so much yummy.

808
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,220
Happy birthday to me!

809
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,420
Can I get this in time?

810
00:34:59,520 --> 00:34:59,960
Yeah, I can.

811
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,540
I'll be fine.

812
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,000
I have a portal too.

813
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,700
I feel like this is just my job.

814
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,960
Alright, here we go.

815
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,180
My new job.

816
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,760
Alright.

817
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,720
Here we go.

818
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,680
Off I go.

819
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm literally just a transporter.

820
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,120
I'm just here to transport bodies.

821
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,520
Alright.

822
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,940
I'm not gonna... yeah, I'm...

823
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,460
I'm on the medic meta.

824
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,860
Why are we here?

825
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,280
Why here?

826
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,140
Why do we go...

827
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,660
Why are we going the long way to get the zone?

828
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,440
Our poor guy's gonna fucking die now!

829
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
Oh my...

830
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,320
I'm fucking...

831
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm walking.

832
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,260
Fuck this.

833
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,480
Oh hey, there's a care package.

834
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,120
Where are we going?

835
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,120
I guess he wanted...

836
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,400
Is that an R9?

837
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,820
Oh my god, that's an R9.

838
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,360
Yummy.

839
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,840
I'm gonna grab this R9.

840
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,640
Okay.

841
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,520
What's this?

842
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,500
30-30.

843
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,620
Ooh, Havoc.

844
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
Ooh, yummy.

845
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,500
Reduce tactical lineup.

846
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,940
I'm a little worried right now.

847
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,940
Oh no, there's a team in front of me.

848
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,240
I'm very worried.

849
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,400
Are we...

850
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Oh, we have two ideas of where we wanna go.

851
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:36,860
Okay.

852
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,120
Where is he going?

853
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,800
Where is he going?

854
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,540
Where is he going?

855
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,020
Is he going into that zone?

856
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,160
Or is he going to me?

857
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,280
Where is he going?

858
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,060
Where is he going?

859
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,160
Where does he wanna go?

860
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,660
Where does he wanna go?

861
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
Where is he going?

862
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,280
Oh, this way.

863
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,660
Okay.

864
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,620
I'm just like...

865
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,520
Where do you wanna go, buddy?

866
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,600
It's hard to tell.

867
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,240
It's so fucking hard to tell where he wants to go.

868
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:07,940
Alright.

869
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,520
Oh, there's fights to my right.

870
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,860
Why did we go that way?

871
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,960
Why the fuck did we go...

872
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,520
Oh my god, I don't understand.

873
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,020
Our random's doing really well, so like...

874
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,400
Whatever.

875
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,120
Oh, somebody fell?

876
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,060
Wait, it says...

877
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,240
I don't know if they're real.

878
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,220
He's going that way.

879
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,480
But where is he going?

880
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,120
Bro, what the fuck?

881
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,460
Why didn't we just fight that guy...

882
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,480
That team over to...

883
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,740
Are we playing zone?

884
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,480
There's no fucking way he's playing zone.

885
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,440
There's no way.

886
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,500
Oh my god.

887
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,180
Oh, thank god.

888
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,020
I was gonna be like...

889
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,540
I swear to god, if you're playing zone...

890
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,020
After everything we've been through...

891
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,260
I swear to fucking god.

892
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,100
Okay.

893
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,600
Oh, we are playing zone.

894
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,740
Where is he shooting?

895
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,600
Wait, what?

896
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,120
Oh my god, there's the other...

897
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,340
Oh, where did he go?

898
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,180
Yeah, buddy.

899
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,200
How did our guy die?

900
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,080
The fuck is a Hornet?

901
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,660
Should I get the Hornet?

902
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,540
What the fuck?

903
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,060
Woah!

904
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,140
What do I have in my arms right now?

905
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,120
Okay, sorry.

906
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,620
I needed to grab the Hornet.

907
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,860
I was so confused what that was.

908
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,090
What the fuck is this tentacle fucker in my arm?

909
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,030
Okay, I'll go...

910
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,430
Alright.

911
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,290
Back at it again.

912
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:47,930
Woah!

913
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,790
It's time to play the medic.

914
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,530
Yippee!

915
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,490
I love being a medic on my team.

916
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,230
Let's go.

917
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,970
Oh, shit.

918
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,310
Sorry.

919
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,950
Give me a sec.

920
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,070
This is much more important.

921
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,730
Oh, it's...

922
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,050
Wait, is this...

923
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,770
The fuck are all these names?

924
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,030
The Hornet?

925
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,830
The Vine?

926
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,350
Whatever.

927
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,270
The Lime?

928
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,970
The fuck are these names?

929
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,210
I hope he doesn't show up.

930
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,890
That's fine.

931
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,430
No!

932
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,670
That's not fine!

933
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,250
No!

934
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,650
No!

935
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,510
I risked my life for you, mad Irishman!

936
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,890
Please!

937
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,650
I risked my entire life for you, mad Irishman!

938
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,150
I literally facetanked that shit!

939
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,990
I swear to God!

940
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,650
If I die after everything I've been through...

941
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,070
I swear to God.

942
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,800
The medic down.

943
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,210
Do I get to play a real game yet?

944
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,490
Do I...

945
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,070
I'm not phoenixkidding.

946
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,570
I don't trust any of them.

947
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,370
Like, can I shoot my gun, please?

948
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,370
Why?

949
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,650
Can I...

950
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,990
Can I please just shoot my gun?

951
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,670
Is that too much to ask for?

952
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,710
But, like, what is this?

953
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,430
Is that a R-301?

954
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,000
You will then point to DPS forces somewhere.

955
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,640
Like, what is my...

956
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,660
What is this?

957
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,360
Like, what in my gun am I holding?

958
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,700
I'm just gonna go straight in.

959
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,520
It's just one guy.

960
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,180
Wait, another squad?

961
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,740
Jesus Christ, I need to take some cover right now.

962
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,500
Okay.

963
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,940
Where's the other team?

964
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,660
Okay.

965
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,360
I need a bat, though.

966
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,180
Oh, no.

967
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Oh, no.

968
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,320
This is bad.

969
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,860
We are no zone.

970
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,080
Hey, this is where we die, right?

971
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,360
This is...

972
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Oh, my God.

973
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,480
We should not have pushed down.

974
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,380
We should...

975
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,280
I don't know why we pushed down there.

976
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,140
Why the fuck there was a...

977
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,420
We came up high ground like that.

978
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,020
Oh, my God.

979
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,160
I just...

980
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,160
I just wanted...

981
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,000
I felt like a...

982
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,580
I felt like I was playing support in a DPS game.

983
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,420
I...

984
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,480
I felt like I was just playing support.

985
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,400
I couldn't even use my R-9.

986
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,100
Everybody was just too far for it.

987
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,900
Whose idea was that?

988
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,740
Not mine.

989
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,060
I saw someone else went down first.

990
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,360
Okay.

991
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,360
What the fuck are these guns I had in my hand?

992
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:06,720
Okay.

993
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,400
I need...

994
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,180
Like, I was looking through the...

995
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,120
All right.

996
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,900
Where is it?

997
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,640
What is this?

998
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,320
In collaboration.

999
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,060
Okay.

1000
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,260
Where are these guns even called?

1001
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,060
It doesn't even say.

1002
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,200
Okay.

1003
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,060
Let's see.

1004
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,740
Where is it?

1005
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,780
Wait.

1006
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,400
Is she live?

1007
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,040
I've been waiting to send this for weeks.

1008
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:29,600
Me.

1009
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,120
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1010
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:31,680
Thank you.

1011
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,380
Thank you.

1012
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,220
301 with mythic skin buffs.

1013
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,680
Okay.

1014
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,780
I'm finding where the...

1015
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,960
I don't see it.

1016
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,100
I was like, what is that my holding at?

1017
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,480
What am I holding?

1018
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,320
Okay.

1019
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,660
There's three.

1020
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,020
Okay.

1021
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,520
Hornet.

1022
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,880
Faster movement and reload speed.

1023
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,780
Attack charge on shield break.

1024
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,200
Alt charge on knock.

1025
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,460
Oh shit.

1026
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:52,840
Wait.

1027
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,160
Hornet sounds like the...

1028
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,420
Oh, it helps relent.

1029
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:55,860
Oh, wait.

1030
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,440
Limelight.

1031
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,020
Helps replenish your squad's health and shields.

1032
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,240
The fuck?

1033
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,680
That is so...

1034
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:01,880
Okay.

1035
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,480
And triggers thermite.

1036
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:03,800
Okay.

1037
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,460
I had...

1038
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,500
What did I have?

1039
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,020
I didn't even know what I...

1040
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,140
What gun I was holding.

1041
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,660
Was I holding a Hornet?

1042
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
I think I was holding a Hornet.

1043
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,440
Okay.

1044
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,540
With faster movement and reload speed.

1045
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,720
The attack charge on shield break.

1046
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,180
And alt charge on knock.

1047
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,420
Okay.

1048
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,920
So Limelight seems to be the best one out of all of them.

1049
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,300
Alright.

1050
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,940
Then I guess I'll try out the Limelight.

1051
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,920
I feel like Limelight seems like the best one because of the heal.

1052
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,640
It can heal people on damage.

1053
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,200
How's your memory this bad?

1054
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,820
It's not bad.

1055
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,120
I literally just deleted it.

1056
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,120
I was like, this information is not important enough, Dali.

1057
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,320
So, Lopez, thank you for the super chat.

1058
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,980
Thank you.

1059
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,280
Also, I can't read, too.

1060
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,500
So there's that...

1061
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,340
Who am I waiting for?

1062
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,360
The three people that hasn't loaded in.

1063
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,460
You can...

1064
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,500
Yeah, I just like...

1065
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,220
In my head, I'd be like, not important.

1066
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,800
And then I just throw it in the trash.

1067
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,740
And it happens instantaneously.

1068
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,800
Okay.

1069
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,720
Now that I know what...

1070
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't know if I like Ashe.

1071
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,780
I don't think I like the...

1072
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,260
I don't like that jump.

1073
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,220
I'll try it.

1074
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,800
I don't like that jump is...

1075
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,400
Dash.

1076
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,920
Because usually dash is for...

1077
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,480
Usually you don't put dash on the jump button.

1078
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,940
Because it fucks up the...

1079
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,000
It fucks up bunny hopping.

1080
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,780
So unless I have to...

1081
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,820
I guess I have to re...

1082
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,540
Like, I have to unbind my scroll wheel and stuff for it.

1083
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,180
Because I don't know.

1084
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,600
I don't really like that jump is dash.

1085
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,440
It's just harder to like...

1086
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,260
It's harder to like...

1087
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,100
Figure it out.

1088
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,980
Because I...

1089
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,140
I'm...

1090
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:48,980
Because I always...

1091
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,760
I always scroll wheel.

1092
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,000
I always use scroll wheel.

1093
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,440
For dash.

1094
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,100
For jumping.

1095
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,200
Because that's what you do for consistent...

1096
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,900
For consistent bunny hopping.

1097
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,380
And...

1098
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:03,660
Wall...

1099
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,120
Like, wall jumping and stuff too.

1100
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,260
What's the new...

1101
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,840
Wait, what do they do for ballistic?

1102
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,920
I'll try ballistic next.

1103
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,740
I'll try ballistic.

1104
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,420
Alright, we'll go here.

1105
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:17,940
Okay.

1106
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,960
Yeah, usually they put it on shift or something.

1107
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,360
So that's why...

1108
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,180
It just throws me off so much.

1109
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,820
That they put it...

1110
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,460
Oh my gosh, of course I get...

1111
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,440
Because like, I do this.

1112
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,520
But then, like, that's my...

1113
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,400
But I would bunny hop a lot.

1114
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,440
But like...

1115
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,520
You can't...

1116
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,260
I can't do that.

1117
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,100
I can't.

1118
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,020
Because that's where my dash is.

1119
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,300
I'll grab this actually.

1120
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,460
I'll just go double energy for now.

1121
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,540
Anybody here?

1122
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,220
I don't know if anybody's here.

1123
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,460
Yeah, and then you can't wall, but that's so true.

1124
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,680
Um...

1125
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,340
Yeah, see?

1126
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,520
Like, I used my dash there when I was just trying to wall bounce too.

1127
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,660
I like the idea, but the execution is pretty bad.

1128
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,440
I'm like...

1129
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,180
I don't know.

1130
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,200
The execution for it is pretty bad.

1131
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,900
Not gonna lie.

1132
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,860
It just...

1133
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah.

1134
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,140
The idea is good.

1135
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,080
I appreciate the cool idea.

1136
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,180
Oh, shit.

1137
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,280
Okay, I'm coming over.

1138
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,420
Don't worry, Turbo!

1139
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,400
I have no idea where they are, but I'll throw this out there.

1140
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:50,690
Oh.

1141
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,390
They loba-queued though.

1142
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,490
That's a cool idea.

1143
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,970
Let's see.

1144
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:00,430
Alright.

1145
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,210
Oh, she dashed too.

1146
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:09,850
There we go.

1147
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,630
Where's the...

1148
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,850
Where's your teammate?

1149
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,050
Is he running away?

1150
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:22,890
You know what that means!

1151
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:23,510
Wait, where did he go?

1152
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,210
Wait, where did he crawl to?

1153
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,530
I was like...

1154
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,530
Oh, he crawled there.

1155
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:31,890
Okay.

1156
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,930
I was like, where the fuck?

1157
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:34,850
He just disappeared.

1158
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,310
I was gonna...

1159
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,370
Oh my god!

1160
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,890
I just wanted to scroll.

1161
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,270
I was gonna do a finisher on him.

1162
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,160
I was like...

1163
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,550
He disappeared.

1164
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,590
He crawled away.

1165
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,170
He crawled so fast!

1166
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,550
He like, buffed the crawl speed so he was gone!

1167
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,270
I was ready to do a finisher on him.

1168
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,870
Why is...

1169
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:06,090
Why is Iwotoki French?

1170
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,210
The French know why.

1171
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,450
You know why.

1172
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,090
You don't even have to be French to know why.

1173
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,490
I'm gonna grab the arsenal.

1174
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,730
My arsenal.

1175
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:24,550
Not arsenal.

1176
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,650
Whatever this was called.

1177
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,670
Extra supplies bin.

1178
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,270
Alright.

1179
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:32,950
Let's see.

1180
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,430
Wait, there's the energy.

1181
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,790
Oh wait, there's the energy one!

1182
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,610
Wait, that's good.

1183
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,630
I need that actually.

1184
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,030
I need to power up.

1185
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:42,810
Nice.

1186
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:43,990
Did it happen?

1187
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:44,910
Did it work?

1188
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,490
Oh, it enhanced my mag.

1189
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:47,030
Okay.

1190
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,570
Okay, it enhanced my mag.

1191
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,650
Alright, get in here.

1192
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:52,990
Thunder boy!

1193
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,150
Get...

1194
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,770
Thunder boy, get in here!

1195
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,930
Thunder boy, do you know how to play video games?!

1196
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:01,870
Sorry.

1197
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,110
Okay.

1198
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,430
Okay, it's fine.

1199
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,850
Everything is fine.

1200
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,170
I'm okay.

1201
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,930
I'm not toxic.

1202
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:15,690
Everything is fine.

1203
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,510
I was just...

1204
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,590
You know, it was just a simple question.

1205
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,130
He's just a little boy!

1206
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,770
He's gonna be a man today!

1207
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,910
How do I word that laugh request in my voice packed French laugh?

1208
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,890
Yeah, that's really it.

1209
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,410
It's just playful guys.

1210
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,330
It was just playful banter.

1211
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,310
I asked very calmly.

1212
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,460
I'm just trying to help him become a man, guys.

1213
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,000
It's just that.

1214
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,060
A lot of people fucking died here.

1215
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:51,920
Holy shit.

1216
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,660
Oh my god, look at all.

1217
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,980
Died a hundred.

1218
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,020
Jesus Christ.

1219
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,020
An army died here.

1220
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,200
I guess you can still get these.

1221
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,380
Am I ever gonna find an R9?

1222
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,620
Like, naturally?

1223
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,440
Oh, I am.

1224
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,180
Nice.

1225
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,680
I asked and I received.

1226
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:21,890
I don't know why.

1227
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,590
Should I gain a phase breach charge or an arc?

1228
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,270
I feel like I should get another charge.

1229
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,450
For that.

1230
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,530
You have to stop seeing things like that.

1231
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,570
Alright.

1232
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:34,950
Things will not.

1233
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,250
I don't think things will be okay.

1234
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,710
Eight squads left.

1235
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,030
Holy.

1236
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,470
This game is so much faster now.

1237
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,230
The fact that it's eight squads left.

1238
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,390
And like, there's still like a million.

1239
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,890
Like, it's still.

1240
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,870
Is this still zone one?

1241
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,310
Yeah, this is still zone one.

1242
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,330
Oh my god.

1243
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,670
It's literally zone one and only eight squads left.

1244
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,510
That's crazy.

1245
00:50:59,350 --> 00:50:59,830
Alright.

1246
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,630
This is where I die.

1247
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,850
Because I don't remember how this map goes.

1248
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,130
Where is the exit?

1249
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,950
Okay, there's the exit.

1250
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,670
I could not.

1251
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,070
I cannot remember how to get out of here.

1252
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,850
They have to be in front of me.

1253
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:17,470
Yeah, they are.

1254
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,320
Okay.

1255
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,180
That was a little bit stupid on his part.

1256
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,650
What the fuck?

1257
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,710
I got deleted so fast.

1258
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:40,700
Jesus.

1259
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,920
Yeah.

1260
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,260
I need to do this so I can heal.

1261
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,820
Jesus Christ.

1262
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,020
Alright, give me a sec while I heal.

1263
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,080
That was so fast.

1264
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,520
I was not expecting how fast that was.

1265
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,060
That was actually such a fast fucking hit.

1266
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,480
I was like, I literally looked at.

1267
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,940
I felt like I looked at him for one second and it was over for me.

1268
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,150
Oh.

1269
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,350
I don't have like anything for this.

1270
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,230
I don't even know if this is smart.

1271
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,410
This was definitely not smart.

1272
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:37,770
Thank God.

1273
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,380
Wait, what?

1274
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,060
There's somebody here.

1275
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,730
There you go.

1276
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,170
No, no!

1277
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:50,810
I got it!

1278
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:51,150
I fucking got it!

1279
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:51,770
I had the third party!

1280
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,590
I just realized that there was a third party.

1281
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:56,890
Oh no.

1282
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:58,770
That's why I'm gonna follow you.

1283
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,210
Oh my God, I'm so fast.

1284
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,290
So fast.

1285
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,090
That's right, I still win that 1v1 though.

1286
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,250
Oh shit, I take that.

1287
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:15,150
And you had a gold and you still lost that 1v1?

1288
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,130
That's crazy.

1289
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:21,650
No!

1290
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,390
Oh my God!

1291
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,570
I thought I risked it.

1292
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,650
Oh my God, but I crossed so fast.

1293
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,150
Oh my God.

1294
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:32,930
No!

1295
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,910
I thought I risked it.

1296
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,270
I was like, they won't know.

1297
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:39,690
How would they know?

1298
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,710
I was like, how would they know?

1299
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,190
And they knew.

1300
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,570
They fucking knew.

1301
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,790
I couldn't believe it.

1302
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,010
I was like, there's no way.

1303
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,790
There's no way they would know.

1304
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,090
But they knew.

1305
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,730
I didn't even shoot the gold!

1306
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,390
I didn't even shoot the gold gun.

1307
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:08,190
But I did kill the Octane when he had a gold gun and I had a non-attachment R9.

1308
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,150
I should've ulted away.

1309
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,790
I was like, I was so cocky there.

1310
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,890
I was like, they won't know.

1311
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:17,870
How would they know?

1312
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,910
I was like, let me just heal here in this corner.

1313
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,990
As they slowly approached me.

1314
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,870
There's no way they would know.

1315
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,310
There's no way.

1316
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,940
I was greedy.

1317
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,700
I admit.

1318
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,740
I was greedy.

1319
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,320
I was so confident.

1320
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,800
I was incredible.

1321
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,860
Okay, ballistic, right?

1322
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,620
Where's ballistic?

1323
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,600
Where is he?

1324
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,620
Is that ballistic?

1325
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,500
No, that's Fuse.

1326
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:48,940
Fuck!

1327
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,620
Sorry!

1328
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,620
They're both...

1329
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,120
I just see two old men.

1330
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,820
And they were the same.

1331
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,580
I had Doki.

1332
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,900
I saw two old men.

1333
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,360
And I was like, that's ballistic, right?

1334
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,060
I was like, wait, no.

1335
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,260
He's not old enough.

1336
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,860
They both had beards.

1337
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,780
So I went with the...

1338
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,360
I went with the wrong beard.

1339
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,060
I went with the wrong...

1340
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,600
Not all old men are the same.

1341
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,740
I'm sorry!

1342
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,680
I clearly saw a beard.

1343
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,040
And then when I clicked on him, I was like, wait a minute.

1344
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,060
His beard's supposed to be white, isn't it?

1345
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,160
Okay, it's like facial hair.

1346
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,460
I was like, okay, they both have facial hair.

1347
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,140
Clearly, I fucked...

1348
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,120
Okay, I fucked up.

1349
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:45,920
I fucked up.

1350
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,800
Not all men...

1351
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,220
Not all old men are the same.

1352
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,560
I now know that, guys.

1353
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,520
I've learned.

1354
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,340
Not all old men are the same old men.

1355
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,620
You guys know Fuse is married to Bloodhound now?

1356
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,120
They like got married and everything.

1357
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,920
That's so cool.

1358
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,940
I didn't realize that they can...

1359
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,440
I didn't realize that they can actually find happiness in this world.

1360
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,960
It's not fair.

1361
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,600
Fuse and Bloodhound get somebody.

1362
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,280
It's not fair.

1363
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,840
Yeah, you guys didn't know that?

1364
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,760
They got married during...

1365
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,340
They got married during ALGS, guys.

1366
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,300
Yeah.

1367
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,560
Look at that.

1368
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,780
If they can find happiness, why can't I?

1369
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,320
I'm sorry.

1370
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,440
This game has lore, I know, right?

1371
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,400
Damn, Doki.

1372
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,540
Out of nowhere?

1373
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,700
Sorry.

1374
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,780
Oh no, I never play Fuse.

1375
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,460
I heard someone to my left.

1376
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,700
I'm like...

1377
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,000
Okay, I just want to make sure.

1378
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,600
It ain't so.

1379
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,230
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

1380
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,590
What the fuck?

1381
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,910
Okay.

1382
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,590
This is two teams, by the way.

1383
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,810
Like, what was your plan?

1384
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,480
Repeating?

1385
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,660
This is how they repeat it?

1386
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,920
I literally...

1387
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,080
Oh my god, I held the fort down and they left.

1388
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:46,660
I literally held the fort down and they left me.

1389
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,100
Like, oh my...

1390
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,200
But look how fast I crawl.

1391
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,500
Oh, and then they rez.

1392
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,100
And then they fucking rez.

1393
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,920
How am I washed?

1394
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,560
This is a team game.

1395
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,680
I literally...

1396
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,960
I literally held the fort down.

1397
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,720
I was like...

1398
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,420
Like, their Bangalore was so fucking stupid.

1399
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,440
I'm literally...

1400
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:09,900
Oh, okay.

1401
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,340
Yeah, no.

1402
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,640
I wasn't going to win that fight.

1403
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,740
How is there still people 3-stacking pubs?

1404
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,860
Oh, well, I guess this is the only way to find joy.

1405
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,040
No, I get it.

1406
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,760
No, no, no.

1407
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,100
It's understandable.

1408
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,340
It's understandable.

1409
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,860
It's the only way to find joy right now.

1410
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,720
It's the...

1411
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,820
I was going to win that fight.

1412
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,440
Oh my god.

1413
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,760
I was like...

1414
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,420
Excuse me?

1415
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,860
You all left me to die?

1416
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,900
The laughter sounds like crying on the inside.

1417
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,300
Guys, I just need one win.

1418
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,940
Guys, I just...

1419
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,400
Oh my god.

1420
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm literally at the end of the stage.

1421
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,120
The spectrum.

1422
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,700
I swear to god in my...

1423
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,380
I'm at the end of the spectrum.

1424
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,860
My mommy says I'm special.

1425
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,500
Okay, get the right...

1426
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,800
Don't worry.

1427
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,260
I'll get the right old man this time.

1428
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:18,700
There, see?

1429
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,980
I got the right one.

1430
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,580
I got the right old man now.

1431
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,260
Yes, Happy.

1432
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,700
This is the right old man.

1433
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,240
We know.

1434
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,380
Mommy says it's a gift.

1435
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,270
How am I always jump master?

1436
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,590
I don't want to be jump master.

1437
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,270
I'm tired of being jump master.

1438
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:47,870
I want to go ape shit.

1439
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,320
How are we at the end of the spectrum?

1440
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,940
Oh no, I'm fucking...

1441
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,060
I'm degrading my SPM.

1442
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:57,460
Good.

1443
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,000
You know what?

1444
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,200
No, I deserve it.

1445
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,060
I...

1446
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,040
I...

1447
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,120
How am I at the end of the spectrum?

1448
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:03,620
Oh, Doki.

1449
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,180
You don't want to ask questions you won't...

1450
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,660
You don't want the answers to.

1451
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,600
Please tell me there's a gun here.

1452
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,160
Nice.

1453
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:13,500
Okay.

1454
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,160
How do I play this game again?

1455
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:16,520
Okay.

1456
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,640
I have a Q.

1457
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,800
What the fuck?

1458
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,680
He just opened the door like that?

1459
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,260
Hey, me too.

1460
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:30,660
Okay.

1461
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,200
There's a climb up here.

1462
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,130
Jesus Christ.

1463
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,590
Oh my god, he has a shotgun.

1464
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:46,270
Where am I?

1465
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,730
Wait, that's a different person that went down for me.

1466
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:49,350
That's...

1467
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:49,630
What?

1468
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,630
He has two shot...

1469
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,810
Mom gave you two shotguns?

1470
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,770
I was like, wait a minute.

1471
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,970
That's a different person.

1472
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,670
Like, I was like...

1473
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,570
I thought I shot an old man.

1474
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,410
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

1475
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,050
How did my old man became a woman?

1476
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,110
I was so surprised.

1477
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,450
That fast?

1478
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,230
I was like, wait.

1479
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,250
That's...

1480
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,110
Wait, I'm so confused.

1481
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,990
I was like,

1482
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,270
your HP is so high too.

1483
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,970
I was like, that fast?

1484
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:31,230
I'm sorry.

1485
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,040
What a name.

1486
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:36,330
Okay, wait.

1487
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,450
Oh, he's a roller player.

1488
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:40,290
Oh, that's embarrassing.

1489
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,070
That's embarrassing.

1490
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,270
I don't know if she can...

1491
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,190
You don't have to...

1492
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:47,230
Oh my god, okay.

1493
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,230
Alright, let's...

1494
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,590
Oh, it's cause they got the fucking arsenal.

1495
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,490
That's how.

1496
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:57,310
I was gonna be like, how the fuck does he have two shotguns?

1497
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:58,030
I...

1498
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,950
I was so...

1499
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,430
I was so confused.

1500
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,330
You get...

1501
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,230
You get a red beacon when you pick up a banner.

1502
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,830
You get a red beacon when you pick up a banner.

1503
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:08,570
You get a...

1504
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:09,870
Okay, I don't think he knows.

1505
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,830
He did not look in the box.

1506
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,950
Apparently, I don't...

1507
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:16,230
I never tried it before.

1508
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,170
But you get a red beacon...

1509
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,190
As you guys didn't know.

1510
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:21,610
You get a red beacon when you pick up a banner.

1511
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:21,730
Alright.

1512
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,510
Oh my god.

1513
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:29,950
I was so...

1514
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,610
I was just like...

1515
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,310
Guys, we can win this.

1516
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,310
I can remember how to play this game again.

1517
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:36,790
I can.

1518
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,530
What's the point of map res if you don't pick up the...

1519
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,850
If you don't pick up the fucking...

1520
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,890
I guess if you don't pick up the res beacon.

1521
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,950
Alright, let's grab something in our lives.

1522
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,450
Let's start missing some shots.

1523
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,110
Let's...

1524
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,790
Let's embarrass ourselves even more.

1525
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,770
Let's just...

1526
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,570
You know, fuck yeah.

1527
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,430
I feel like...

1528
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,270
I've already get rock bottom.

1529
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,850
What's the worst that can happen?

1530
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:10,830
Yeah.

1531
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,850
Let's just embarrass ourselves just a little bit more.

1532
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,410
Alright, let's see.

1533
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,230
There's people here.

1534
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,590
So I'm a little bit scared.

1535
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,290
Hello?

1536
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:31,510
Alright.

1537
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:32,630
Oh no.

1538
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,110
That's just a...

1539
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:34,970
That's just a wall.

1540
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,110
Nevermind.

1541
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:37,930
I was like, there he is!

1542
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:38,770
And then I just like...

1543
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,670
No, that's just a...

1544
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,090
That's just a little stick on the air.

1545
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,530
I mean, the R9 does feel nice.

1546
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:46,170
I feel like I'm winning fights with...

1547
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,150
Okay, increase ult.

1548
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,970
Whistler duration in the world is triple.

1549
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,970
Increase ult duration...

1550
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:52,190
Eh.

1551
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,650
I'll do the ult duration if I can live that long.

1552
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,270
I feel like...

1553
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,250
I feel like my...

1554
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,530
The R9 is good.

1555
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,410
That way?

1556
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,210
Oh shit.

1557
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,530
Wait, they're so far.

1558
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,030
I didn't even realize they ran so far.

1559
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,830
If I can get an R9, it'll be over.

1560
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:16,930
I'm heading over.

1561
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,730
I'm heading over.

1562
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:22,690
Guys, give me a sec, guys.

1563
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,790
I didn't realize you guys ran.

1564
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:27,810
It's okay.

1565
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,810
If they die, then like, I can...

1566
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,130
Then like, I can rez them.

1567
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,150
Guys, I'm so far away, guys.

1568
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:42,990
Let's hope they don't die by the time I get there.

1569
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,950
Because I actually want to be part of this fight.

1570
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,290
Oh okay, it's looking less and less likely.

1571
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,530
I just realized I have my ult for a fucking wingman.

1572
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,610
Might not be the smartest choice.

1573
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:00,990
Like, where are they?

1574
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:03,510
Where are they fighting?

1575
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,510
Oh, right here.

1576
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:06,870
Okay.

1577
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,650
Oh, I thought I could climb...

1578
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,810
Oh fuck!

1579
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,890
Yeah, I'm backing out.

1580
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,630
Okay, I need a scope for this wingman.

1581
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:30,010
I realize I don't know how to shoot without a scope.

1582
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:33,270
Oh my god, I don't know the distance for climbing anymore.

1583
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,870
It's been so long.

1584
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,350
Aim, like I said.

1585
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:38,910
Are you serious?

1586
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,180
Guys, guys, guys!

1587
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,480
Really?!

1588
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,480
Really?!

1589
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,520
Oh my god, what?!

1590
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,360
That guy actually left me?!

1591
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,180
Oh my god!

1592
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,300
Oh my god!

1593
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,780
They actually left!

1594
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,880
I was like, oh clearly they're gonna come back, right?

1595
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,400
They heard the gunshot, right?

1596
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,800
And they all just ran off!

1597
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,500
What the...

1598
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,240
Oh my god!

1599
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,880
We're a team, right?!

1600
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,660
They just...

1601
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,060
Guys, I'm not playing ballistic.

1602
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,020
I need like an actual escape.

1603
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,920
It's just as rough as I remember.

1604
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,600
I thought they'll turn around!

1605
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,200
I thought they'd actually turn around!

1606
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,300
They heard the gunshot!

1607
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,480
So I was just like, they'll turn around, right?

1608
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,820
Oh my god.

1609
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,200
I was not expecting...

1610
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,140
I was like, okay, I can't run in the open.

1611
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,360
Cause like, there's no cover and there's an entire team next to me.

1612
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,440
So, I'll stay here.

1613
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,320
And then my teammates, you know, in my head, I was like...

1614
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,000
My teammates, they'll get an off angle.

1615
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,400
Because they're perfectly positioned to get an off angle for this.

1616
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,800
And then, so they can't push me for free.

1617
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,200
Because they're over there.

1618
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,280
Silly me for thinking that far ahead.

1619
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,160
God, that's so silly of me.

1620
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,940
That really is.

1621
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,500
So fucking silly.

1622
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,880
I forgot people don't do that.

1623
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,860
In a pub.

1624
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,520
That's so silly.

1625
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,660
Oh, but he's a pro fucking runner at least.

1626
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,280
You know, at least he's a pro dodger.

1627
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:52,920
Wow!

1628
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,260
Oh my god.

1629
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,740
Alright, I'm not playing ballistic.

1630
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,720
I actually need to play a character that can run away.

1631
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,180
I'm not...

1632
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,540
I've played a team game for so long.

1633
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,900
Guys, I've played team games for so long.

1634
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,580
I actually forgot what it's like to be a solo player.

1635
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,100
Because in Rivals, even if you're a solo queue player in Rivals.

1636
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,700
You can depend on your teammates.

1637
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,860
Because it's a team game.

1638
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,940
Um...

1639
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,300
So, so I gotta readjust my thinking here.

1640
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,080
To remember that, that ain't true no more.

1641
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,900
That ain't, that's not true.

1642
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,780
But it truly was.

1643
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:54,360
I, I never learned how to be a fucking, a fucking solo queue player.

1644
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,880
In, in a Battle Royale.

1645
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,860
I cannot play a team game in that fact.

1646
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,380
Oh my god.

1647
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,460
Okay, let's see.

1648
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:08,560
I guess like, Wraith is the best solo queue.

1649
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,940
I don't know if Bangalore is still good.

1650
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,700
So I'll just play Wraith for the queue.

1651
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,280
God, I remember how to...

1652
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,120
Yeah, I forgot.

1653
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:21,400
You gotta be incredibly selfish when you're playing, when you're playing fucking Apex Legends.

1654
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,520
I forgot about that, guys.

1655
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:30,740
Ugh.

1656
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,600
Okay, this time it'll be different, right?

1657
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,120
This time.

1658
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,260
Vantage is fun?

1659
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,800
Yeah, but I don't have a team.

1660
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:44,100
Vantage is fun when you have a team so you don't get walked up on.

1661
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,860
Battle Royale was making me so soft.

1662
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,560
No, it did.

1663
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:54,580
It made me feel like I have people I can rely on.

1664
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,280
But then I forgot the world is a cruel place.

1665
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:06,600
I can't believe I thought, like, I can rely on people and that people are not stupid as fuck.

1666
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,360
I forgot about that.

1667
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,060
This is the real world.

1668
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,940
Rivalous is like...

1669
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:25,720
Marvel Rivalous is like the dream you had where you're like, what it was like to have world peace and everything and people working together.

1670
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,790
And then...

1671
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,520
I bet some of you guys were like, well, not in my games, but like in my games.

1672
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,480
In the higher elo games.

1673
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,180
And then Apex is like the real world.

1674
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,400
The world today where everything is on fire.

1675
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,060
Wake up!

1676
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,100
This is the actual world.

1677
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:56,900
We all woke up and this is the real world that we have to live in.

1678
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,960
Wake up, Samurai.

1679
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,520
The world's on fire.

1680
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,560
You're living it.

1681
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,280
Okay, I'm not playing for the team anymore.

1682
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,280
No, never again.

1683
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,440
I'll still stay with the team.

1684
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,880
I wanna get that bin to the right.

1685
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,140
Or left.

1686
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,740
Okay, there's people fighting here.

1687
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,670
I hear people in front of me.

1688
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:35,330
Jesus Christ, I hear a lot of people in front of me.

1689
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,930
I mean, I could...

1690
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,570
Double check this.

1691
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:49,590
Do something dumb.

1692
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,360
Oh my god, that was so dumb.

1693
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,060
That was actually so dumb.

1694
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,660
Oh hey, he's a roller player.

1695
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:08,780
Okay.

1696
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,100
Should reload for me, right?

1697
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,320
I holstered it.

1698
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,900
Didn't it say it should reload?

1699
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,000
Shouldn't it?

1700
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,360
Do I have a holster?

1701
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,840
I don't know.

1702
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,660
I'm not reading things properly as always.

1703
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,820
Oh, I got the standard stock.

1704
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,870
Brave and dumb.

1705
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:36,750
That's right.

1706
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,370
I need to be aware of what the TTK is now.

1707
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:43,710
Damn.

1708
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:44,830
You okay, buddy?

1709
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,350
Oh, it's assault classes only.

1710
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:48,050
Okay.

1711
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:49,590
That's good to know.

1712
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:52,290
I don't know which is an assault class, but that's...

1713
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:58,130
I don't know which one, but that's good to know.

1714
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,550
Where's my ping?

1715
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,190
481?

1716
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,550
Okay.

1717
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,110
Alright.

1718
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,420
Jesus Christ.

1719
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,300
Okay, there's a Wraith to my right.

1720
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,660
Wait, what?

1721
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,480
Oh shit, that's our guy.

1722
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,540
I thought it was the fucking enemy team flanking me.

1723
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,980
I need to grab ammo.

1724
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,340
Don't get rid of this.

1725
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,540
What?

1726
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,540
Why?

1727
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,020
Oh my god, that was so fast.

1728
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:43,500
Just crawl.

1729
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,300
That's so fast.

1730
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:49,800
Where?

1731
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:55,450
Jesus Christ.

1732
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,550
What the fuck?

1733
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,420
I'm dead.

1734
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:05,800
I'm dead.

1735
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:06,140
I'm dead.

1736
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:06,500
I'm dead.

1737
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:06,820
I'm dead.

1738
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,240
I'm dead.

1739
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:16,150
I'm so dead.

1740
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:16,970
No!

1741
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:22,930
I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense that my team was 9.

1742
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:26,210
I did shit on that guy though.

1743
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:31,190
I did shit on him.

1744
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,070
I take those.

1745
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,250
I shit on that guy.

1746
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:37,650
Couldn't 1v3!

1747
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:39,030
Washed!

1748
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:47,510
She would've been able to 1v3 if she wasn't washed.

1749
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:48,370
Okay.

1750
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:51,350
Okay, with the TTK like that?

1751
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,950
Oh my god, I might as well be rank 1.

1752
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,690
Oh my god.

1753
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:07,530
Couldn't 1v3.

1754
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:11,270
The Doki I knew would be able to do it.

1755
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,650
Oh my god.

1756
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,990
Yeah, fuck you!

1757
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:17,510
What does it say about this guy?

1758
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,690
He couldn't 1v1!

1759
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,590
He couldn't even fucking 1v1!

1760
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,210
What does that say about him?

1761
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:35,150
He lost a 1v1 two times in a row!

1762
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,730
If I'm washed, what does it say about that?

1763
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,110
He is not Doki though.

1764
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:53,770
He was never good to begin with, so not washed.

1765
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,590
Okay.

1766
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:57,130
Okay.

1767
01:15:59,290 --> 01:15:59,770
Alright.

1768
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,110
Wraith tab.

1769
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:05,230
He's double washed, that's what it says.

1770
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:08,830
We can win a game.

1771
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,450
I think we can win a game.

1772
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,050
We just gotta play like a little fucking bitch.

1773
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:17,670
Like, play like a little bitch.

1774
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:21,830
Or like, we got, oh my god, everybody's stacking.

1775
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,850
It's crazy.

1776
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:28,670
I thought like, I thought they fixed the pub system where...

1777
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,390
They're stackers.

1778
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:32,630
That sucks.

1779
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,570
I legit thought they fixed the pub system for that.

1780
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:42,430
I feel like, at this point, like, a lot of people are just stacking now.

1781
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,830
That's for rank?

1782
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,510
No, they do that for pubs too.

1783
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:50,710
It's not just a rank thing, it's a...

1784
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,650
Go here.

1785
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:52,450
Go here.

1786
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,770
I wanna... No!

1787
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:54,890
Go here!

1788
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:56,570
Please!

1789
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:58,690
I want the R9!

1790
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:00,510
I'm going there.

1791
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,550
I'm going there.

1792
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,970
I need that R9 right now.

1793
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,380
Okay, then I'll upgrade my thing.

1794
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,640
Does it do it if I... Oh, it does.

1795
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,580
It does give it to me.

1796
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:19,820
Nice.

1797
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,760
I'm going for the R9.

1798
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,560
I'm surprised nobody landed here.

1799
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,100
This has literally the best arsenal.

1800
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,520
Which is the R9.

1801
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,280
Which is funny because this house has an R9 too.

1802
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,000
R9 secured.

1803
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,660
Like, so many people fighting over here.

1804
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,560
I don't know if we should fight for it though.

1805
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,840
Let's just poke.

1806
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,600
I think we can win our game.

1807
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,300
We might be washed, but like...

1808
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,680
It can't be that bad.

1809
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,660
Why are they fighting?

1810
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,940
I'm trying to figure out where this fight is.

1811
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,560
The fuck is this?

1812
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,380
Oh, it's over here.

1813
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,180
Okay, we can go behind them.

1814
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,320
We can actually fight behind them.

1815
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,050
Just go.

1816
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:20,650
Give them back shots.

1817
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:26,550
Oh shit!

1818
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:30,470
We got one of them.

1819
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:33,390
That's fine.

1820
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:40,900
Okay.

1821
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,300
Where is he?

1822
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,200
Oh shit.

1823
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,400
Oh, this guy's crazy.

1824
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,000
Oh my god, this guy's crazy crazy.

1825
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:58,260
Oh my god, you're fucking crazy crazy.

1826
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:01,840
Okay.

1827
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,160
I have one more.

1828
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,420
Fuck it!

1829
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:09,780
Nevermind.

1830
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,590
Oh, I don't have...

1831
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,510
Oh shit!

1832
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:20,550
He pushed him.

1833
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,930
Okay, maybe we shouldn't have done back shots.

1834
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,550
I don't know now.

1835
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,140
That's fine.

1836
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:38,860
That's fine.

1837
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,450
It's not, but like...

1838
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,460
Oh shit!

1839
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:44,670
Okay, I would...

1840
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,560
That was...

1841
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,240
That was good.

1842
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:48,160
That was a good play.

1843
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:51,900
Okay.

1844
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,740
I would admit...

1845
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,700
That play was...

1846
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:54,980
Okay.

1847
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,260
Yeah, we weren't winning that.

1848
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,360
We weren't winning that.

1849
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,900
That was like...

1850
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,520
That was a movement play right there.

1851
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,440
I would admit...

1852
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,360
That's the new ass play.

1853
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,460
I will...

1854
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,500
I will give him credit.

1855
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,920
That was a sick play.

1856
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,400
Holy shit.

1857
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,220
I was just like...

1858
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,080
Okay, so that's how you play Ashe.

1859
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:21,960
I see now.

1860
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,940
I think I can do that.

1861
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,920
That seems easy to do.

1862
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,740
I think I can do that.

1863
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,300
Alright.

1864
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,740
You know what?

1865
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,620
I'm gonna do duos.

1866
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,880
This is...

1867
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,920
Trios is too sweaty.

1868
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:44,740
Trios is three sweaty people stacked together.

1869
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:45,900
At least duos...

1870
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,060
I could just have to...

1871
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,820
At least duos is like two people stacked...

1872
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,880
Two sweaty people stacked together.

1873
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,700
No, duos is like two sweaty people stacked together.

1874
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:00,200
Trios, apparently, is three fucking people stacked together.

1875
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:05,820
So...

1876
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,320
So I'll take what I can get.

1877
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,380
If I have five...

1878
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,580
Unless duos is dead.

1879
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,460
Is duos dead?

1880
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,200
Oh, don't tell me duos is dead.

1881
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,940
The season just came out.

1882
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:18,460
The...

1883
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,180
The season...

1884
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,440
The season just came out.

1885
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,440
Why is there only 15 people here?

1886
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,440
Oh, 17.

1887
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,360
I need...

1888
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,800
How many people do I need for duos?

1889
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:30,720
How many people do I need for duos?

1890
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,860
How many people have to exist for me to play duos?

1891
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,080
Oh my...

1892
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,060
Guys...

1893
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:38,640
Oh, 21.

1894
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,700
It's going up there.

1895
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,880
People are slowly dying.

1896
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:44,060
I can't believe there's only one lobby going on.

1897
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:45,360
That's crazy.

1898
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,400
Actually, just one lobby for duos?

1899
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:52,520
I'm gonna make my waiting room for my members stream while we wait.

1900
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:54,500
Like...

1901
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,280
I did...

1902
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,500
I did do my tweet for my members...

1903
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,000
For my members stream.

1904
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,520
And we're gonna be here.

1905
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,860
Okay, let's see.

1906
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,920
Where's my template for my...

1907
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,860
For my mem...

1908
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,860
Oh my god.

1909
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:07,400
26.

1910
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,300
I'll wait it out.

1911
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,740
I'll do one game of duos.

1912
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,980
And then I'll die instantly.

1913
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,320
And then I'll be like, THIS WASN'T WORTH IT!

1914
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,480
I have a feeling that that's where it's gonna go, guys.

1915
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,400
I don't know.

1916
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:24,740
I have a feeling that we're gonna die on RIP.

1917
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,620
And then I'm gonna scream at how that wasn't worth it.

1918
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,380
And then I'm gonna go back to trios.

1919
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,740
And I'm gonna like...

1920
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:31,440
I'm gonna like...

1921
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,940
Actually, I'm gonna go to rank.

1922
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:33,480
I'm gonna...

1923
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,800
I didn't win one...

1924
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,520
Oh my god.

1925
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:42,060
I don't know if pubs are always this incredibly fucking sweaty.

1926
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,360
Or like, I just haven't played in a long ass...

1927
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,920
I think it's the lower TTK.

1928
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,320
I think it's the lower TTK too.

1929
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,120
The lower TTK has made it seem even harder.

1930
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,380
Just cause like...

1931
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:01,040
Because like, people just die so much faster.

1932
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,560
This is how I remember pubs.

1933
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Pubs has always been this sweaty.

1934
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,420
It's been so long since I played pubs.

1935
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:13,440
Like, I forgot it was like this.

1936
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:17,080
I've been in like...

1937
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,860
I've been happy for so long.

1938
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,840
I forgot what it was like.

1939
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,480
I forgot what it was like.

1940
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,740
I've been happy for so long.

1941
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,680
That like...

1942
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,360
And the insta queues too.

1943
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,720
I think that's the worst.

1944
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,020
The fact that it isn't insta queue has to make me like...

1945
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,500
What was the word?

1946
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,260
Like, just like think about what just happened.

1947
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,140
What's that word?

1948
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,480
Where you're like, retrospect.

1949
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,300
Like, I have to be...

1950
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:03,140
I have to actually like let everything sink in and be more aware of what just happened.

1951
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,060
And yeah, I have to do self reflection.

1952
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,240
There's too much time to self reflect.

1953
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,200
I missed it when it was insta queue.

1954
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,820
So I don't have to think about my actions.

1955
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,090
Instead, I'm sitting here.

1956
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:20,930
I'm stuck here.

1957
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:23,430
I have to wait.

1958
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,050
Oh my god.

1959
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:26,550
I have to wait.

1960
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,270
Alright, let's see.

1961
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:30,610
Did I make my members?

1962
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:31,230
I did.

1963
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,870
I already made my members waiting room.

1964
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,970
Alright, let's see.

1965
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,970
I'm gonna put that here.

1966
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,150
And then...

1967
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:41,410
It's the free...

1968
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:43,630
The queue is so long.

1969
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:47,110
I'm fucking making my waiting room tweet for my next stream.

1970
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:56,530
It's the free to play Fall Guys game where they made a skin for Mr. Beast.

1971
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:59,890
Alright, let's see.

1972
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,710
I have to ponder all my misplays exactly.

1973
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:05,850
And the silence too.

1974
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,090
Oh, the game sound started.

1975
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:09,490
Wait, why am I not in?

1976
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:11,430
Wait.

1977
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,050
Wait, guys.

1978
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,890
Guys.

1979
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:15,550
No, I waited so long.

1980
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:17,050
Wait.

1981
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,130
Excuse me?

1982
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:27,350
No, they can't do this to me.

1983
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:27,930
Oh, thank god.

1984
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:29,910
That's gonna be like...

1985
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:31,350
Can't do this to me.

1986
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,630
The fact that I have to listen to that.

1987
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,650
I think I can do what that Ashe did to me.

1988
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:43,290
I just need to remember not to bunny hop.

1989
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:47,030
That's all I need to do.

1990
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:50,150
As long as I don't bunny hop, it should be okay, right?

1991
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:55,670
I thought he was gonna kick me out after everything I did.

1992
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,320
The good, good Ashe boy.

1993
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,760
I don't think this guy knows how to spell.

1994
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:06,820
Okay.

1995
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:09,460
If we go to the core, we can get an R and I.

1996
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,860
Okay, let's just die.

1997
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,620
You waited the same amount of time as I waited for a queue.

1998
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,400
Like, no, maybe even more.

1999
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:23,060
Like, you're gonna throw away your life just like that.

2000
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:28,060
Just like that, you're gonna throw away your life.

2001
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,520
We waited for that queue for so long!

2002
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,180
And you're just gonna throw it all away!

2003
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,600
Also, Dipper, thank you, welcome to the tomato farm.

2004
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,680
Welcome, welcome.

2005
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,680
Where the fuck is the light ammo arsenal?

2006
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,840
Oh my god, I swear to god.

2007
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,700
If I land here and then, like, I die, I swear to fucking god.

2008
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:51,460
Okay.

2009
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,060
Where's my- where's my buddy?

2010
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,340
Oh, there he is.

2011
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,640
I'm a little scared, guys, not gonna lie.

2012
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,960
I'm a little scared, guys, not gonna lie.

2013
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:11,400
I don't know if I can, uh, I don't know if I can trust Troy from High School Musical.

2014
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,440
Do you trust Troy from High School Musical?

2015
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,580
Cause I don't.

2016
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,360
Hey, Troy.

2017
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:24,360
Troy!

2018
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,100
Okay.

2019
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,920
Is he gonna push up?

2020
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:38,900
He's gonna run?

2021
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,320
Okay, that's interesting.

2022
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,320
He's just running off like that.

2023
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,460
Where is he?

2024
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,540
Oh, there he is.

2025
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,090
I won my one.

2026
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,190
Are you gonna win your one?

2027
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:02,970
He's not.

2028
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:10,990
He did not win his- he didn't win his one, guys.

2029
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:17,730
I was just like, I don't think he's gonna win his one.

2030
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:24,010
I carry Troy, I'm the Gabriella to his Troy.

2031
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,590
They're like over here.

2032
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:31,290
I'm pretty sure.

2033
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:35,590
That's where the- that's where the Lobo is, yeah.

2034
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:39,210
Oh, he does not- he is so lost.

2035
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:41,990
He does not know how to read Lobo cues.

2036
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:45,430
He does not know how to read Lobo cues.

2037
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,730
In what world do you think they're on the other side?

2038
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,850
They're obviously up here.

2039
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:01,860
Oh, Troy.

2040
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,540
Oh, Troy.

2041
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:07,940
Oh, Troy.

2042
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,680
Troy, Troy, Troy.

2043
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,120
I'm gonna get an off-angle.

2044
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,030
Where's my teammate?

2045
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:27,910
Oh, there he is.

2046
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:29,570
Wait, you're supposed to not be here.

2047
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:31,470
I'm getting the off-angle.

2048
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:35,650
Troy!

2049
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:36,750
Troy!

2050
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,030
Oh my God, Troy, now they're here!

2051
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:44,310
Troy, you fucker!

2052
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,910
This is why you get an off-angle!

2053
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:51,130
Oh my God, Troy!

2054
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:03,300
Okay, alright.

2055
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,340
I don't like Troy.

2056
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,320
Oh no!

2057
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,500
My Troy!

2058
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:17,580
My Troy had a rough time, man!

2059
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,560
He fucking got cued!

2060
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:25,620
He had five seconds to process that cue, but he still stayed there.

2061
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:32,360
He still stayed- I'll do one more.

2062
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,400
I'll do one more duo.

2063
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,460
And then I'll go to rank.

2064
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,920
Maybe rank would be less sweaty.

2065
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,820
Dead God, thank you for the super chat!

2066
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,640
Thank you, thank you!

2067
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,060
Hey, Doug, you lost my account with a one-year badge to a glitch.

2068
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:43,840
Should I start a new one?

2069
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,500
When YouTube randomly gave me the OG account back!

2070
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:51,460
Should I continue my glitched account's one-year badge or restart on my non-buster account?

2071
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:52,300
Why not both?

2072
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,300
I think you have two chonky goons.

2073
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:57,500
Less sweaty?

2074
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:00,640
You see, my rank is bronze, so it'd definitely be less sweaty.

2075
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,680
You chill in rank and try hard on quick play.

2076
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,580
That seems about it!

2077
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,260
That seems how it goes now.

2078
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:22,080
It's a free-to-play where they made Mr. Beast a skin for Mr. Beast.

2079
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:30,890
I'm ready to destroy my dragoon.

2080
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,380
Is this the right waiting room?

2081
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,820
I think it is.

2082
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:36,920
Let me double check.

2083
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:46,860
I swear to God, if bronze is just as sweaty, I swear to fucking God, I'm going to find something and be like...

2084
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,680
Oh my God.

2085
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,880
Dragoon's Destroyer.

2086
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,280
Okay, I believe in Alejandro Ventos 3.

2087
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,640
I believe in a guy that doxes himself in Apex Legends.

2088
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,220
That's already a good sign.

2089
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:21,560
If he is willing to dox himself in Apex Legends, he has zero fear.

2090
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,620
He has zero fucking fear.

2091
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,640
That's dedication right there.

2092
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:35,900
I believe.

2093
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,080
That's a man with nothing to lose.

2094
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:44,740
Exactly.

2095
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:46,800
Exactly, guys.

2096
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,100
Alright, Alejandro.

2097
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:56,360
You have nothing to lose.

2098
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,320
And I have everything to lose.

2099
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,720
And then he's playing Loba in duos.

2100
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,080
Okay.

2101
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,180
Okay, I believe.

2102
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:15,960
Even though I see he's on Loba in duos, I fucking believe.

2103
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,600
My belief hasn't wavered yet.

2104
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,520
When do I get my, like, master duo player that still plays this game regularly?

2105
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,740
Like, when do I get that?

2106
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,280
Like, I don't ask for much.

2107
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,260
Just for someone to carry me.

2108
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:40,560
Like, is that too much to ask for?

2109
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:42,960
Are there good players that still play this game?

2110
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,180
That solo?

2111
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,840
That, sorry, I gotta be more specific.

2112
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,160
That solo queues?

2113
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,280
Are there still good players that still solo queue?

2114
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,380
Are they all stacking now?

2115
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,040
Or is that what it's led to?

2116
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,580
Yes, you.

2117
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,480
You're the last solo queue player alive, apparently.

2118
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,300
Where are you dropping to, Alejandro?

2119
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:13,980
Like, we don't even make this!

2120
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,020
Oh my god!

2121
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:20,540
A very bold move.

2122
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,920
Yeah, no, no, no shit.

2123
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:22,580
It's fatal.

2124
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,780
No shit.

2125
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,720
A bold move.

2126
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,480
Yeah.

2127
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,140
No, no, he's right.

2128
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,000
He's right.

2129
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,360
He cooked a little too hard.

2130
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:37,000
Alright.

2131
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,560
I don't feel like it's superior positioning right now.

2132
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,500
Oh my god.

2133
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:50,020
Oh my god.

2134
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,160
Okay.

2135
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,700
He's so lucky no one landed at the bottom.

2136
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,200
He's so fucking lucky.

2137
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:08,280
Alright, I saw the way he did the drop and I knew it was over.

2138
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:12,900
I knew that I'm the better player in this duo.

2139
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,660
You still believe?

2140
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,800
No, I stopped believing.

2141
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,240
No.

2142
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,340
Is it obvious that I stopped believing?

2143
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,000
Maybe there is hope in this cruel world.

2144
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:36,500
The moment I saw that we were not making it, like, that belief was gone.

2145
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,260
And he's not healing, by the way.

2146
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,360
I'm not even gonna give him medkits at this point.

2147
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,960
I'm not even gonna give him any heals.

2148
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:59,900
Oh my god, he just left you to die like that.

2149
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,580
That's fucked up.

2150
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:06,580
Oh, you cross so fast.

2151
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,020
Jesus Christ, there's so much loot.

2152
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:30,090
I know this is- Oh hey, R9.

2153
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:33,470
That's what I wanted.

2154
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,350
I'm gonna cap your fucking box.

2155
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,790
Are you

2156
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:42,780
serious?

2157
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,920
Jesus Christ.

2158
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,720
Oh my god.

2159
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,180
I hope you're crawling.

2160
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,300
I hope you're crawling.

2161
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,300
Oh, he left.

2162
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,360
That's cool.

2163
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:09,420
Alejandro!

2164
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:10,500
Okay.

2165
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,700
Okay, Alejandro.

2166
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,660
Okay.

2167
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,100
Okay.

2168
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,500
He fucking left.

2169
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:20,620
Alright.

2170
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,020
Okay.

2171
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,320
Okay.

2172
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:30,620
Okay.

2173
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,500
Oh, by myself.

2174
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:38,600
That's fine.

2175
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,400
That's fine.

2176
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,380
I'm not okay.

2177
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,020
He ran away.

2178
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:47,640
I can't believe he ran away.

2179
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,660
Toki, does this sound like a person that's okay right now?

2180
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,900
He's crawling.

2181
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,060
Alright, you know what?

2182
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,160
I might as well just die, I guess.

2183
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,400
Oh my god.

2184
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,240
How do I- How do I- Okay.

2185
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,860
Alright, now I have to figure out a 1v2 again.

2186
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,260
Okay, I can third party that, right?

2187
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:20,470
Where's this fight?

2188
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,450
I'm gonna go in prematurely.

2189
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:33,340
Okay, if I go from behind, I don't think they'll hear.

2190
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,940
They're like right in front of me.

2191
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,200
Okay, I went in prematurely.

2192
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,140
I went in prematurely, guys.

2193
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:57,690
They like turned around.

2194
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:59,150
I was not expecting that.

2195
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,560
I was not expecting them to turn around.

2196
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,180
Jesus Christ.

2197
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:09,740
I was like, what?

2198
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,260
Weren't you guys fighting somebody?

2199
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:19,400
Doesn't help that I'm on like white armor.

2200
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,560
Yeah, two seconds ago.

2201
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:23,060
And then they went back to kill him!

2202
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,080
I'm gonna try and get an armor upgrade.

2203
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,580
This white armor is actually killing me right now.

2204
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:36,480
I need to get at least blue armor if I want to make this work.

2205
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:38,240
And if I don't, I just die.

2206
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,380
White armor right now as a solo, it fucking hurts.

2207
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:44,820
I think there's people in front of me.

2208
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:46,120
So I don't know.

2209
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,500
I saw a gunshot up here.

2210
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:53,780
Alright, this is where I either die or I get away with the biggest heist possible.

2211
01:39:56,790 --> 01:40:00,370
Okay, and I'll grab... I'll grab this.

2212
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,690
And I'll grab an arsenal too.

2213
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:08,210
UGH!

2214
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,070
DAH!

2215
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:10,090
WHY?!

2216
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:12,450
Oh shit, that was a reflex.

2217
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,950
What did I get shot by?

2218
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:16,690
Wait, what?

2219
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:18,930
What shot me?

2220
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:26,630
Wait, what shot me?

2221
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:32,880
Here.

2222
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:48,870
What the fuck?!

2223
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:55,260
These little fucking rats!

2224
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:19,040
Fucking hell, you guys are such rats.

2225
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,000
Oh my god.

2226
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:23,000
Jesus.

2227
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,840
Actual fucking rats.

2228
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,880
Oh my god.

2229
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,380
Actual little bitches.

2230
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,340
Alright, am I washed, guys?!

2231
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,640
Am I washed?!

2232
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,340
Still washed.

2233
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,560
Oh my god.

2234
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,400
That shit was like... I was like, the fuck are you guys doing?

2235
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:49,920
Oh my god.

2236
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,620
Fucking crazy... fucking little bitches.

2237
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,620
I'm no longer washed.

2238
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,520
We're so back.

2239
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,020
What's your name?!

2240
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,840
Oh yeah, Sunky Ray!

2241
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,860
My chat called me washed, get shit on!

2242
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,040
I'm gonna die here.

2243
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:13,700
We're so back.

2244
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,960
That's fucking right.

2245
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,140
I shamed them.

2246
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:26,520
Get 1v2'd by someone that hasn't played this game but still liked.

2247
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,780
True gamers don't watch, we all know that.

2248
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,020
I was like, the fuck are they doing?

2249
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:34,440
Following me.

2250
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,640
Holy shit, that's cringe.

2251
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:42,180
Okay, I think the R9 is really good though.

2252
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:42,800
Honestly.

2253
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:47,300
I think the R9 is actually really, really good.

2254
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,680
I don't know, it is my favorite gun.

2255
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:54,240
So I know I can make plays with it.

2256
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,720
Okay, I think I can third party this.

2257
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,300
I just have to play like a fucking rat.

2258
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:01,340
I always have to third party, or I die.

2259
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,080
I saw somebody in front of me.

2260
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:28,290
Oh, you see that guy?

2261
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:29,610
I'm...

2262
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:33,130
You see that guy that's trying to rat?

2263
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,470
Oh shit.

2264
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,150
Oh no.

2265
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:37,570
No, I didn't even saw!

2266
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:38,570
Fuck, I...

2267
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:40,390
I fucked...

2268
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:41,510
I don't know why I keep...

2269
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:44,070
I keep thinking my Q is like an escapability.

2270
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:46,190
I keep thinking my Q is my Z.

2271
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:52,630
I was looking at the rat and then the other rat was looking at me.

2272
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,270
It was like, we were just two rats looking at each other.

2273
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:02,690
Yeah, I keep thinking my Q is my Raze Q.

2274
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,210
I hear somebody next to me.

2275
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:22,020
No.

2276
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,020
No, no, no, no!

2277
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:23,380
He's buddy!

2278
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,900
No, no!

2279
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:26,280
I got dead slide!

2280
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:28,700
Oh, fuck!

2281
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,920
I got a dead slide.

2282
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,460
Oh my god.

2283
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,840
Oh, unlucky.

2284
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,300
My dead slide fucked me over.

2285
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:41,280
Okay, but like, I'm getting there.

2286
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:41,720
I'm figuring.

2287
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:42,380
I'm clearing.

2288
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,740
Like, oh my god!

2289
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,180
I got a dead...

2290
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:48,640
The dead slide is when your slide gets caught.

2291
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:57,640
So that your slide gets caught and you don't have a smooth movement.

2292
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:01,960
So like, I literally got dead slide twice during that.

2293
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:05,400
And I could have like, got out because of it.

2294
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,240
Oh my god, that fucking sucks.

2295
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,180
I actually could have killed 1v2 them if I didn't dead slide.

2296
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:11,820
Yeah, I lost my momentum.

2297
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:12,660
Yeah.

2298
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,820
I got stun-locked.

2299
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:17,880
My leg got stuck.

2300
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:18,280
Yeah.

2301
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,220
Tommy Longlock, follow kill leader.

2302
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:23,460
Follow me.

2303
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,240
There's two rookies and 34 bronze.

2304
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:30,040
That's me!

2305
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:33,340
Yeah, no, I could have 100% 1v3 them.

2306
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,980
1v2 those two.

2307
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,840
If I didn't get the dead slide, it was so easy.

2308
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:46,260
Oh my god.

2309
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:47,480
So close.

2310
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:51,080
I think RNI Massive is the way to go.

2311
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,160
If I'm playing Ashe.

2312
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,580
I'm pretty sure.

2313
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:59,570
Holy shit, who are those fucking...

2314
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:02,390
Six people not in.

2315
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:03,890
It's not us.

2316
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:06,510
I have Tommy Longlock and follow kill leader.

2317
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:07,310
Follow me.

2318
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:09,430
How about not whiffing those?

2319
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:11,650
We don't talk about those.

2320
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:15,290
Look, everyone...

2321
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:16,590
Look, not everyone...

2322
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:19,910
Me missing those shots means I'm human, okay?

2323
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:24,670
You could have snared them?

2324
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:25,590
Yeah, I know.

2325
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:26,790
I could have snared them.

2326
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:31,290
I don't play Ashe that often.

2327
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:34,370
So I forget my abilities.

2328
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:39,570
If I don't play a character that often, I forget to use my abilities and just rely on aim.

2329
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:41,710
Which sometimes doesn't work out for me.

2330
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:47,850
Alright.

2331
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:51,070
Will I have an actual team or will I have silver teammates?

2332
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:54,050
Oh hey, it's King's Canyon.

2333
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:54,950
I love this map.

2334
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:58,030
Alright, let's find out guys.

2335
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:00,830
Will I have real teammates or will I have silver teammates?

2336
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:10,900
Do I trust him?

2337
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,940
We'll see if I do.

2338
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:16,860
We'll see.

2339
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,680
Let's see.

2340
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,500
I want to grab the energy arsenal.

2341
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:27,960
Bro.

2342
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:29,860
Bro.

2343
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:32,860
I guess the real bro experience right there.

2344
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:33,760
But still.

2345
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,260
Bro.

2346
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:40,360
I'll just grab these two.

2347
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:41,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2348
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:42,660
I didn't mean to drop down.

2349
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:44,580
I'm gonna get this.

2350
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,980
Holy shit, Tommy Longzock.

2351
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:49,380
You're going straight in.

2352
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:52,520
You're fucking crazy, Tommy Longzock.

2353
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,660
Where's the Val?

2354
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,980
I literally saw him drop down.

2355
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,980
There's one.

2356
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:12,220
How'd the door shut?

2357
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:13,880
I didn't do much.

2358
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,260
Do it.

2359
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:27,560
Oh my god.

2360
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,300
There we go.

2361
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,760
This feels a lot easier.

2362
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:42,260
This game does feel a lot easier now.

2363
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:50,380
Wow.

2364
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,420
I guess I'll do ultimate.

2365
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,640
I don't feel like I need the scream.

2366
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,580
To be like that.

2367
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:02,440
I wanna get... I want an R9.

2368
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:05,700
Ping me.

2369
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:08,080
Ping me R9.

2370
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:17,940
Alright,

2371
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,020
I just want an R9.

2372
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,140
Until like I... that's all I want.

2373
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:28,280
Alright.

2374
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:34,000
Since I'm not Ashe, I don't need a play... I don't need a play master.

2375
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:38,880
So I'll do... I'll do R9... I'll do R9 Nemesis.

2376
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:43,820
Yeah, R9 Nemesis so I don't have to use two of the same ammo.

2377
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:46,820
Alternator?

2378
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,320
I'll take it for now.

2379
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,000
I'll take it for now.

2380
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:54,420
He knows who the carry is.

2381
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,340
And then he's gonna regret it.

2382
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:00,540
I'm just gonna use my Q to get there faster.

2383
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,940
That's fucking right.

2384
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,940
I'm gonna use my Q just to get there faster.

2385
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,500
That's fucking right.

2386
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,640
Jesus Christ, it's so long.

2387
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:14,580
It's so far.

2388
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,740
I'm gonna get the R9.

2389
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:29,360
Okay, there's a Carbine here too, but we don't need that.

2390
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,680
Jesus Christ, where's my R9?

2391
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:40,400
Somebody open this right now or I'm gonna fucking freak out.

2392
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,140
Where's my Ashe?

2393
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:45,280
Go do your thing, Ashe.

2394
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:47,340
Alright, let's go.

2395
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,840
That's fucking right.

2396
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:52,820
What?

2397
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:53,600
Why?

2398
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,680
Why go over here?

2399
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,280
Alright.

2400
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:04,100
Alright, I guess I'll go over here.

2401
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,900
I don't like that.

2402
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:10,780
Bro!

2403
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:12,200
Fucking bro!

2404
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:15,060
Un-gas yourself now!

2405
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,720
What the fuck is wrong with your stomach?

2406
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:21,740
Please.

2407
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,080
He's giving comms though!

2408
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:25,940
The true bro experience.

2409
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,680
Get yourself a bro that's willing to burp on mic for you.

2410
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:36,030
It's like you're playing Atlanta right now.

2411
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:38,270
I beg you, please mute him.

2412
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:44,850
I like how he's asking us, the bronze players.

2413
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:53,250
He's asking us, the bronze players, if we know.

2414
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:01,610
Alright, I just need to have zero attachments on this gun.

2415
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:08,650
I'll put my stock on the R9, I guess.

2416
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:12,610
I'm literally right behind you!

2417
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:16,370
Where's the bridge?

2418
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:17,350
I'll go this way then.

2419
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:20,790
And get high ground.

2420
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,520
Better not be lying, because I'm on high ground.

2421
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:35,160
There you go.

2422
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:36,760
I got him.

2423
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:38,840
I got him!

2424
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:46,420
Bro, are you okay?

2425
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,060
Are you okay?

2426
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,500
Can you not get up on there?

2427
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:51,760
Can you not climb up this?

2428
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:56,430
Fuck, okay.

2429
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:58,230
I thought I could hide through that.

2430
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:03,230
There's Tommy Longzock.

2431
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:08,810
Oh, that is very cocky.

2432
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:13,750
I was like, really?

2433
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:21,730
Bro, use your brain, bro!

2434
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:24,050
Where was he?

2435
01:53:27,630 --> 01:53:29,510
Bro, what?

2436
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:37,890
That was... oh man, that was... I shouldn't have pushed.

2437
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:41,690
I thought he was going to climb up, but he didn't.

2438
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:44,170
He's so weird.

2439
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:46,750
I literally can't trust the team.

2440
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:52,350
I climbed up, because I thought he was going to climb up, when I climb up.

2441
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:59,470
And then I shot them for like 5 full seconds, and he still didn't climb up.

2442
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:06,590
I was like, okay, I'm going to aggro them, and then he's going to shoot them in the back.

2443
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:10,790
But he didn't shoot them in the back, so I'm so confused.

2444
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:17,130
That's too... I know, I need to remember to play like not a team.

2445
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:19,090
This is bronze.

2446
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:25,570
I keep playing as if we're a team, you know?

2447
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:31,830
But I have to remember, I cannot play like that.

2448
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:33,070
Like...

2449
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:41,890
I need to remember to set my expectations so fucking low.

2450
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:43,730
I have to remember that.

2451
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:50,350
Oh my god.

2452
01:54:51,330 --> 01:54:54,530
I need to remember, there's no team here.

2453
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:56,550
There's no team here.

2454
01:54:58,330 --> 01:55:00,510
I was like, alright, I got the aggro.

2455
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:03,310
You can shoot them in the back.

2456
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:05,110
Do me some back shots.

2457
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:08,190
He didn't do the back shots, guys.

2458
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:12,330
Okay, Doki.

2459
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:15,110
Play as if you're a solo player, Doki.

2460
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:18,130
Like, you can't trust no one.

2461
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:22,350
You gotta play like you're by yourself and alone.

2462
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:27,370
That's how the world works now.

2463
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:31,670
Oh man, the closest crafter is that cage.

2464
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:42,070
That's why I would've dropped down if I knew that he wasn't gonna shoot them.

2465
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:45,330
God, my head is too much.

2466
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:49,530
Now I know that they're gonna play like silver players.

2467
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:53,050
I don't know.

2468
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:57,750
I was like, are they gonna play like a team or are they gonna play like silver players?

2469
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:02,030
Leave,

2470
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:07,670
just crap.

2471
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:09,870
Just crap.

2472
01:56:12,110 --> 01:56:14,390
Bro, what is he doing?

2473
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:16,510
He could just crap.

2474
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:22,330
They're not following nobody, bro.

2475
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:27,130
Why did he watch for so long?

2476
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:29,570
He legitimately could've just crapped at us.

2477
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:31,430
He did not have to wait.

2478
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:39,930
Watch, I'm gonna crap you and you're either not gonna do anything or I've been following you.

2479
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:41,650
We'll see, bro.

2480
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:42,110
We'll see.

2481
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:43,970
Resist.

2482
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:45,070
Just resist.

2483
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:48,890
Oh my god.

2484
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:51,370
He didn't even pick up the craft.

2485
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:52,750
He didn't pick up the res beacon.

2486
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:56,110
He didn't pick up the res beacon that cost him a crafter.

2487
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:59,050
Oh my god, and he gets the havoc.

2488
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:01,110
Oh, thank god he gets the res beacon.

2489
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:02,770
Oh my god, just res.

2490
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:05,190
Just, just, oh my god.

2491
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:06,530
Bro, why?

2492
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:09,990
Okay, play like a solo, Doki.

2493
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:11,770
You better do something, bro.

2494
01:57:12,990 --> 01:57:14,470
Play like a solo.

2495
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:16,150
I gotta play like a solo.

2496
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:17,950
I gotta play like a solo.

2497
01:57:18,150 --> 01:57:20,170
I gotta play like a solo.

2498
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:20,930
I gotta...

2499
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:30,770
I gotta play like I have no buddy anymore in my life.

2500
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:36,150
Oh my god.

2501
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:39,790
Aww.

2502
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:42,330
Aww, Mupi.

2503
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:46,130
Aww, Mupi.

2504
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:54,250
What do you mean, I'm not kidding.

2505
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:06,170
Oh my god, oh my god.

2506
01:58:07,570 --> 01:58:09,650
Oh my god.

2507
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:10,470
Gosh.

2508
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:16,270
Bro, this is so weird, bro.

2509
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:19,570
Okay, play like a solo.

2510
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:21,750
Play like a solo.

2511
01:58:23,210 --> 01:58:26,010
Oh my, these guys.

2512
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:30,630
Bro, why, how is he crashing out in silver?

2513
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:32,290
I don't understand.

2514
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:37,910
How are you crashing out that badly in a bronze silver lobby?

2515
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:40,230
That's actually crazy.

2516
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:42,870
And then I don't even get a third player.

2517
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:45,310
I don't even get a third.

2518
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:51,510
Oh my god.

2519
01:58:51,650 --> 01:58:53,310
Oh thank god he exists, Doki.

2520
01:58:53,390 --> 01:58:55,390
I was gonna be like, I don't...

2521
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:56,410
Oh my god.

2522
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:57,990
Okay, play like a solo.

2523
01:58:58,370 --> 01:59:01,530
Play like you have no one to rely on, Doki.

2524
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:05,070
Play a good old solo experience.

2525
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:12,430
Oh my god.

2526
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:13,810
I'm gonna get a cough drop.

2527
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:15,670
I'll be right back.

2528
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:05,880
Yeah, I'm back.

2529
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,080
Do you think my team will be okay?

2530
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:10,660
Do you think...

2531
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:12,900
Do you think they'll be okay?

2532
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:17,720
Do you think they'll be okay?

2533
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:27,960
I don't know.

2534
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:31,440
I don't know if my team will be okay this time.

2535
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,820
I think we can win a game.

2536
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,720
How are we landing?

2537
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:45,940
That's so far.

2538
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:48,420
Why is this so far?

2539
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,720
Oh my god.

2540
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,600
We're landing so far.

2541
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:57,880
I'm gonna grab the elite ammo.

2542
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,880
I'm grabbing my R9.

2543
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,480
I'm wearing R9 Mastiff.

2544
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,440
It's... Now it's bronze.

2545
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:10,800
So it should fall.

2546
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,000
The next ring is far.

2547
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,140
Do not get caught outside of it.

2548
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,620
I'm under fire.

2549
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:26,470
One minute.

2550
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:28,750
We have significant ground to cover.

2551
02:01:30,630 --> 02:01:33,610
I'm checking here just to see if we drop down.

2552
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:35,930
No.

2553
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:37,890
I hear... Oh!

2554
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:43,840
Oh no, this is bad.

2555
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:44,500
We're cornered, right?

2556
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:45,800
What?!

2557
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:47,320
Oh my god!

2558
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,260
Wait, where's our third?

2559
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,040
Oh, there he is.

2560
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:51,600
Okay.

2561
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:55,140
I was like, is our third gonna be with us?

2562
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,680
Okay, let's see where our third goes.

2563
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,680
Okay, don't worry.

2564
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:01,560
He can craft us.

2565
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:04,940
Oh, if he crafts us, I'll get my R9 back.

2566
02:02:07,170 --> 02:02:08,150
Bro, the crafter is over there.

2567
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:09,750
Bro, bro, bro, bro.

2568
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:11,970
You can tell he's lost.

2569
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:15,310
You can tell Saucy Drew is very lost, guys.

2570
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:19,910
He is not okay right now.

2571
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:22,310
He's...

2572
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,600
I'm out of money.

2573
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,400
I'm falling.

2574
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:57,260
Oh my god.

2575
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:58,400
Okay.

2576
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,820
Don't be mean, Trey.

2577
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:04,460
Oh my god.

2578
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:06,580
I think I need more friends.

2579
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:10,820
I think I need more friends.

2580
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:18,080
Oh my god.

2581
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:20,700
I definitely need more friends.

2582
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:24,340
Oh my god.

2583
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:29,220
Oh my god.

2584
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:30,360
Oh my god.

2585
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:32,140
This has not...

2586
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:34,720
Oh my god.

2587
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:36,490
Relatable.

2588
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:39,600
Pro plays like I do.

2589
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,720
Don't.

2590
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,320
Oh my god.

2591
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,620
Don't even know what I just saw.

2592
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,700
I don't even know.

2593
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,160
Okay.

2594
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:53,460
Okay.

2595
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,500
We can grab a Mastiff here.

2596
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,160
This isn't looted, so...

2597
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:02,800
Oh god.

2598
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:03,240
What?

2599
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:04,900
Wild red.

2600
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,320
Yeehaw.

2601
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,180
Yeehaw.

2602
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,840
I need this.

2603
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:15,160
Do I have any?

2604
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:15,720
Okay, I do.

2605
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:16,080
Okay.

2606
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,120
I need to grab a Mastiff from this.

2607
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:20,980
Where's the Mastiff?

2608
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:21,400
Okay.

2609
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:25,180
Enhance my Mastiff, sir.

2610
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:26,540
There we go.

2611
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,460
I got a bolt from that.

2612
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,400
That's good.

2613
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:32,190
Alright.

2614
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:37,030
This is okay.

2615
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:41,510
Okay, I'm leaving.

2616
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:49,810
They can loot as much as they want, but I'm gonna grab a Harvester so I can get blue armor.

2617
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:57,070
Okay, I think the extra thing is better.

2618
02:04:58,050 --> 02:04:58,650
Honestly.

2619
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:03,410
The only issue is just the fact that I don't have...

2620
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:04,750
I don't have...

2621
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:08,030
I have a long range, so...

2622
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:10,190
Remember, no teammates.

2623
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:11,530
No teammates, Doki.

2624
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:13,330
You cannot rely on anybody.

2625
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:16,270
No teammates at all.

2626
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:18,450
You're just a sad, lonely girl.

2627
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:25,880
Lonely, Mr. Lonely.

2628
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:31,840
I have nobody to call my own.

2629
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:37,160
Lonely, Mr. Lonely.

2630
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:39,780
You have nobody.

2631
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:46,120
The saddest game of my life.

2632
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:52,840
Okay, let's throw this.

2633
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:53,800
I have that.

2634
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:58,440
If only he can pick up a controller and carry me right now.

2635
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:01,380
I can upgrade my R9 here.

2636
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:02,400
Actually.

2637
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,080
Still got it.

2638
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,540
I can still open doors.

2639
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:20,080
I can still open doors.

2640
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:22,380
At least I got that in me.

2641
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,840
I just want to upgrade my R9.

2642
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,080
Nice, I got my stock.

2643
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:36,900
Oh.

2644
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:38,960
Wait a minute.

2645
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:41,100
There's someone here.

2646
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:45,300
There's someone here.

2647
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:03,290
Hi there.

2648
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:06,730
It's...

2649
02:07:06,730 --> 02:07:08,050
Oh wait, nevermind.

2650
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:08,390
JK.

2651
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:10,450
I forgot the storm can kill him.

2652
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:11,550
It's JK.

2653
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:13,960
I forgot the storm can kill him.

2654
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,370
JK.

2655
02:07:17,170 --> 02:07:18,790
I forgot that was a thing.

2656
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:20,690
They usually...

2657
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:23,390
In the past, it didn't.

2658
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:27,070
In the past, the storm never... doesn't kill him.

2659
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,300
I forgot that was something they added in King's Canyon.

2660
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:38,840
For those like in the old King's Canyon, storm doesn't kill the dragon.

2661
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:42,740
So like, you know, you wouldn't get like fucking paranoid.

2662
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,560
And shit about it.

2663
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:46,900
I was like, the fuck?

2664
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:55,330
I don't hear any gunshots at all.

2665
02:07:56,570 --> 02:07:57,990
The storm is deadly?

2666
02:07:58,110 --> 02:08:01,650
Yeah, but then the dragons would like live forever in the storm.

2667
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,560
Are you fucking...

2668
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:06,350
Are you serious?!

2669
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:07,440
Are you serious?!

2670
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:11,150
They waited for us!

2671
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:11,570
Oh

2672
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,520
my god.

2673
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:30,240
They actually wanted these fuckers.

2674
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:31,900
Oh my god.

2675
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:34,000
Like, how long were they waiting?

2676
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:39,320
They must have waited for so long!

2677
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,940
I like...

2678
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:43,760
There was no...

2679
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:44,780
There was no outplay.

2680
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:48,220
There was actually no outplay for that.

2681
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,320
Like...

2682
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:53,900
There was...

2683
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:55,900
There was no outplay potential!

2684
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:57,580
How did like...

2685
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:01,300
Like, three people ran in there and waited for me.

2686
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,940
Oh my god.

2687
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,780
I couldn't even outplay it.

2688
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:09,460
Oh my god.

2689
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,560
Oh my god.

2690
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:15,860
I'm so sad.

2691
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:18,400
I'm so sad.

2692
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:20,220
That I had no...

2693
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:22,420
There was no way to outplay that.

2694
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:25,820
There was no outplay ability.

2695
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:28,220
I literally just died.

2696
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,160
Even...

2697
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,080
Even if I...

2698
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:33,680
Oh my god.

2699
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,760
I couldn't even get my ult out in time because of it.

2700
02:09:37,980 --> 02:09:40,920
I could not get out of that ambush.

2701
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:46,380
I even used my dash.

2702
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:48,860
Oh my god.

2703
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:53,100
If I got around the corner, I think I could've lived.

2704
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,780
I could've lived.

2705
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:55,680
I got around the corner.

2706
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:56,860
I dashed to the corner.

2707
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:58,420
And then...

2708
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:01,080
They like ambushed me in such a perfect time.

2709
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:02,980
That like...

2710
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:07,720
It was such a perfect ambush because I was too far deep into that line.

2711
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:08,820
That like...

2712
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:09,440
I can't...

2713
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,860
There was no way for me to get out of there.

2714
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:15,660
Like, even if I Q instantly, I die.

2715
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:17,560
That was actually crazy.

2716
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:18,640
It was just...

2717
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:20,900
They waited at the perfect moment.

2718
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:21,460
I heard...

2719
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:23,220
I heard the ballistical and I turned around.

2720
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:24,000
I...

2721
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,360
I even...

2722
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,380
I even went with the sound Q.

2723
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:35,280
Oh my god.

2724
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,300
What are you doing here?

2725
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:40,910
Oh my god.

2726
02:10:41,050 --> 02:10:42,410
That was actually crazy.

2727
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:43,110
Just...

2728
02:10:43,110 --> 02:10:43,410
Just...

2729
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:44,450
Just hot drop me.

2730
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:44,990
I don't care.

2731
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:45,390
It's bronze.

2732
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:47,250
I'm tired of running around.

2733
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:48,090
Just hot drop me.

2734
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:49,770
Just hot drop.

2735
02:10:49,830 --> 02:10:50,370
I'm tired.

2736
02:10:50,370 --> 02:10:51,490
I'm so fucking tired.

2737
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:52,170
Just hot drop.

2738
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:53,330
Just fucking hot drop.

2739
02:10:53,410 --> 02:10:54,430
I'm so fucking tired.

2740
02:10:54,670 --> 02:10:55,930
At least take me to containment.

2741
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:56,770
At least...

2742
02:10:56,770 --> 02:10:56,910
No!

2743
02:10:57,150 --> 02:10:57,310
No!

2744
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:57,910
You're bronze!

2745
02:10:58,030 --> 02:11:00,130
You don't need to play this!

2746
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:03,910
You're bronze!

2747
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:05,770
You don't need to play!

2748
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:07,130
Oh my god.

2749
02:11:07,190 --> 02:11:07,490
Okay.

2750
02:11:13,470 --> 02:11:15,570
You don't need to play!

2751
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:17,150
Don't be like this.

2752
02:11:17,630 --> 02:11:18,150
We're...

2753
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:19,410
We don't...

2754
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:24,410
Let me out.

2755
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:25,250
Let me...

2756
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:25,890
At least land here.

2757
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:26,950
At least land here.

2758
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:27,990
At least land here.

2759
02:11:28,090 --> 02:11:29,290
At least land here.

2760
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:31,170
And then we can third party this place.

2761
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:31,910
At least...

2762
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:33,470
At least land me there.

2763
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:34,670
Like, that's all I want.

2764
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:37,270
We're gonna...

2765
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:38,170
We are...

2766
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:39,170
Are we...

2767
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:39,850
Yeah.

2768
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:41,470
They're gonna get R9 from this.

2769
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:44,150
Are we fighting for...

2770
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:44,630
No, we're not.

2771
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:45,050
They're not.

2772
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,030
We're not fighting for this.

2773
02:11:46,110 --> 02:11:46,770
Okay, that's good.

2774
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:48,690
That's good.

2775
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:50,450
That's...

2776
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:51,010
That's fine.

2777
02:11:51,010 --> 02:11:52,010
At least we're not...

2778
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:54,630
That's fine.

2779
02:11:56,650 --> 02:11:57,690
I'm okay, guys.

2780
02:11:57,750 --> 02:11:58,290
I'm okay.

2781
02:11:59,170 --> 02:11:59,650
I'm...

2782
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:00,870
I'm okay, guys.

2783
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:04,470
I'm...

2784
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:05,470
Oh, shit.

2785
02:12:05,590 --> 02:12:06,030
That's not what I...

2786
02:12:06,030 --> 02:12:06,490
I'm okay.

2787
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:08,410
I'm not crashing out.

2788
02:12:13,110 --> 02:12:14,670
I'm not crashing out, guys.

2789
02:12:14,710 --> 02:12:15,210
I'm okay.

2790
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:17,150
Let's just run triple take, too.

2791
02:12:18,970 --> 02:12:21,190
I don't know if triple take is still good.

2792
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:21,850
Honestly.

2793
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:22,350
Oh, wait.

2794
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:23,530
I'll just run massive.

2795
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:24,210
Fuck it.

2796
02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:25,650
I'll run long...

2797
02:12:25,650 --> 02:12:26,730
I'll run short range.

2798
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:31,470
With how they're fucking me, I might as well run short range.

2799
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:37,350
Oh my...

2800
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:38,070
I'm okay, guys.

2801
02:12:38,110 --> 02:12:38,570
I'm okay.

2802
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:41,370
I am 100 positive.

2803
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:41,950
Okay.

2804
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:47,260
Okay, I got my mag.

2805
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:50,060
You guys wanna fight?

2806
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:51,160
Are you guys fighters?

2807
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:52,140
Are you guys fighters?

2808
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:53,220
Do you guys wanna fight?

2809
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:53,760
Are you...

2810
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:57,260
Are you guys...

2811
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:58,560
Are you guys...

2812
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:58,980
Are you guys fighters?

2813
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:01,860
You guys wanna fight?

2814
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:03,260
Guys!

2815
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:03,800
Guys!

2816
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:04,900
Are you guys gamers?

2817
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:06,040
You guys wanna fight?

2818
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:08,240
Yeah?

2819
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,080
Alright, we're fighters.

2820
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:17,660
Alright, let's see.

2821
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:18,840
I'm not going first.

2822
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,540
I don't trust my fucking team.

2823
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:25,200
I'm never going first again.

2824
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,080
After...

2825
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:32,500
After the last game, I'm never going first again.

2826
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:35,700
Go!

2827
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:36,060
Go!

2828
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:36,600
Go!

2829
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:37,420
They're third partying.

2830
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:37,720
Go!

2831
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:44,650
They're literally in front of me.

2832
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:44,890
Go!

2833
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:45,310
Shoot them!

2834
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:45,630
Shoot them!

2835
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,160
Guys!

2836
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:56,560
Go!

2837
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,720
He's literally right here.

2838
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:58,680
We shoot this guy...

2839
02:13:58,680 --> 02:13:59,060
This team.

2840
02:13:59,140 --> 02:13:59,820
We pincer them.

2841
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:03,540
Okay.

2842
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:04,480
I'm gonna go...

2843
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,220
I'm gonna get an off angle.

2844
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:10,880
Okay.

2845
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:14,960
Just crawl.

2846
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:15,340
Just crawl.

2847
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:15,820
Just crawl.

2848
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,260
Wait, where's the...

2849
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:21,100
Where's the other guy?

2850
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,000
I'll cover.

2851
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:33,420
This is a different team.

2852
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:36,120
This is two teams.

2853
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:38,340
So...

2854
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:40,320
I wanna go for the team to the left.

2855
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:41,240
Or right.

2856
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:42,280
Oh!

2857
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:56,900
Stupid.

2858
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:00,280
Holy shit.

2859
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,320
You're so stupid.

2860
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:04,080
You're actually so stupid.

2861
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:06,820
Where did the box go?

2862
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:13,450
Really?

2863
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:14,670
You're gonna run?

2864
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:32,940
What?

2865
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,100
I hear him.

2866
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:44,080
I hear this guy.

2867
02:15:51,670 --> 02:15:53,070
Oh my god.

2868
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:55,330
Okay.

2869
02:15:55,390 --> 02:15:56,010
I'm going for it.

2870
02:15:56,170 --> 02:15:57,450
I'm going for this kill.

2871
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:00,230
I'm going for this kill.

2872
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:02,170
I'm already committed to it.

2873
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:19,080
Okay.

2874
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:19,460
Cool.

2875
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:23,640
Alright.

2876
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:27,580
Okay.

2877
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,880
This is what I'm gonna do.

2878
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,280
I am gonna...

2879
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:33,160
Where's the closest crafter?

2880
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:34,920
Where's the closest crafter?

2881
02:16:36,140 --> 02:16:37,360
I'll go this way.

2882
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,460
Alright.

2883
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:42,240
This is what I'm gonna do.

2884
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:48,380
I guess this is...

2885
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:50,400
Okay.

2886
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:56,180
Alright.

2887
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:57,880
Let's do this.

2888
02:16:58,380 --> 02:16:58,740
Alright.

2889
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,740
In the zone we go.

2890
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:05,880
Okay.

2891
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:10,420
I'm not gonna use my redeploy yet.

2892
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:11,640
I'm gonna go here.

2893
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:13,500
I'm gonna craft them.

2894
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,800
And then I'm gonna use my redeploy.

2895
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:19,440
And redeploy the containment.

2896
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:21,700
And then I'll...

2897
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:23,380
I shouldn't use my Q, but fuck it.

2898
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:29,440
Like, why would you not commit to that kill?

2899
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:32,040
Like, you might as well.

2900
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,500
There's no point in being a little fucking bitch.

2901
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:42,440
Oh my god, I guess...

2902
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:43,380
Off I go.

2903
02:17:44,460 --> 02:17:47,040
Oh, let's hope there's nobody crafting there.

2904
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:51,520
I heard some noises I don't like.

2905
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:52,860
Alright.

2906
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:54,580
I either die or live.

2907
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,440
We'll see here.

2908
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:57,940
I have to craft them there.

2909
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:00,660
And then I take a redeploy and go to containment.

2910
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:03,360
And I'm either gonna die from...

2911
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:03,720
Oh wait, no.

2912
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:05,020
Actually...

2913
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:06,140
Okay, I can craft...

2914
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:06,880
Actually, I can...

2915
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:07,340
I can do this.

2916
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:08,680
I forgot I can craft it.

2917
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:09,540
Do I...

2918
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:12,540
I thought I heard...

2919
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:13,960
I did hear something.

2920
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:15,920
Oh

2921
02:18:19,590 --> 02:18:20,390
fuck, okay.

2922
02:18:21,450 --> 02:18:23,450
Okay, I can craft them.

2923
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:25,710
Alright.

2924
02:18:26,610 --> 02:18:29,010
Alright, here's the plan.

2925
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:33,070
The next crafter is over there.

2926
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:33,510
Okay.

2927
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:37,410
Oh my god, there's too many people here.

2928
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:39,390
Oh, there's too many people here!

2929
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:39,770
Okay.

2930
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:41,150
Fuck, okay.

2931
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:42,470
This is a little hard.

2932
02:18:45,430 --> 02:18:47,330
I gotta sneak in then.

2933
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:50,570
Maybe they pushed up.

2934
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:56,820
They pushed up.

2935
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:03,770
Pushed up.

2936
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,440
I had to get rid of that, so...

2937
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:16,220
Is there a crafter?

2938
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:19,260
There's no fucking...

2939
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:20,900
Okay.

2940
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:23,940
Alright, this is gonna be the riskiest shit I ever play... do... done.

2941
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:26,220
I take a reapply.

2942
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:29,680
And then we'll see if I live.

2943
02:19:30,300 --> 02:19:32,680
And then we'll try and go there, I guess.

2944
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:40,740
They won't see my trail if I do this!

2945
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,280
There's people fighting there.

2946
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:52,360
There's people fighting there.

2947
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:54,720
Okay.

2948
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:55,020
Okay.

2949
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:59,580
Okay, maybe I can get a rez here.

2950
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:05,820
What?!

2951
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:09,060
I can't even get a Q out!

2952
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:12,080
Are you serious?!

2953
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:15,400
There's no... I can't even get a Q out!

2954
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:18,580
When I get... Oh my god, the TDK is so fast.

2955
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,460
The TDK is actually so fast.

2956
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:22,520
Oh my god.

2957
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:27,120
Like, you can't even press Q.

2958
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:30,440
I had to get out of that.

2959
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:37,040
Jesus.

2960
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:40,900
And it's this fast in Bronze.

2961
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:43,460
Like, oh my god.

2962
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:47,220
Didn't know you were playing.

2963
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:47,700
God.

2964
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:55,830
I think, like, if the TDK is that fast, I think...

2965
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,360
I really think they need to lower the Wraith's Q time again.

2966
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,040
Like, yeah.

2967
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,220
Like, the Wraith Q has to be lowered.

2968
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:10,080
Like, there's no... There's... It's actually, like, useless.

2969
02:21:10,660 --> 02:21:12,020
Her Q is so fucking useless.

2970
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,500
I was like, I don't think Wraith's the play.

2971
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:22,820
It's so... Like, her Q is just so fucking useless at that point.

2972
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:26,680
TDK is time to kill.

2973
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:31,440
And the fact that these were Bronze players shredded me that fucking fast.

2974
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:42,000
When I can't even use her Q ability to even get out of it.

2975
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,040
Yeah, I might try Bangalore.

2976
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:45,880
Maybe.

2977
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:47,100
If I can't...

2978
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:51,960
I think Ashe, right now, is really good for escape ability with her dash.

2979
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:55,100
But, like, I honestly think that...

2980
02:21:55,540 --> 02:21:57,980
It's either I play Ashe or Bangalore, I think.

2981
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:01,340
I keep thinking it, like, Q, it would be easier.

2982
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:03,220
But, it's not.

2983
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:08,940
Oh my god.

2984
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:15,560
Yeah, Ashe is definitely good against this time to TDK.

2985
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:18,400
But, like, playing Wraith...

2986
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:21,520
Playing Wraith, it was just so fucking rough.

2987
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:22,600
Playing Wraith with that.

2988
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:27,100
Yeah, I might try Bang if I don't get Ashe.

2989
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:28,640
I'm gonna fucking insta-jump.

2990
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:30,160
Insta-land.

2991
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:32,300
Like, I'm tired of...

2992
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:34,420
Uh, we'll do...

2993
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:36,180
We'll do...

2994
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,160
Let's see, we'll do...

2995
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:38,880
I'm going Capacitor.

2996
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,840
I'm fucking going Capacitor.

2997
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:43,420
I'm done with...

2998
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:44,120
I can't.

2999
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,040
I can't run around.

3000
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:47,060
We either die or we get kills.

3001
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:48,440
Let's get here.

3002
02:22:49,580 --> 02:22:50,400
I wanna land here.

3003
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:51,380
I wanna land here.

3004
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:53,360
I wanna land here.

3005
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:55,260
I need that R and I.

3006
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:05,640
Okay.

3007
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:11,040
Jesus Christ, that TTK.

3008
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:15,160
That TTK was absolutely fucking brutal.

3009
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:17,140
Holy fuck.

3010
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:18,940
Alright, I'm coming over.

3011
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:22,600
Oh my god.

3012
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:23,640
Okay, I'm coming over.

3013
02:23:28,310 --> 02:23:29,110
You crawl fast.

3014
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:29,710
You crawl fast.

3015
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:30,850
You should be...

3016
02:23:31,670 --> 02:23:32,630
There you go.

3017
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:38,360
You're welcome.

3018
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:41,600
I got one of them down for you.

3019
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:50,520
And I knocked one of them down for you.

3020
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:51,240
You're welcome.

3021
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:02,720
Alright, this is a little bad for me because I have no shield cells left.

3022
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:17,700
Okay.

3023
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:28,660
Where are they?

3024
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:32,870
Where's the other guy?

3025
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:37,150
What?

3026
02:24:37,430 --> 02:24:38,190
Where's the other guy?

3027
02:24:41,210 --> 02:24:42,190
Oh, there he is.

3028
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:43,310
I was like, where is he?

3029
02:24:51,170 --> 02:24:52,170
He ran, yeah.

3030
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:53,870
I was like, where did the other guy go?

3031
02:24:56,050 --> 02:25:00,610
I didn't get a chance to upgrade my R and I because I had to save this fucker.

3032
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:02,830
Oh, this is a new team.

3033
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:03,530
This is a new team.

3034
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:04,310
This is a new team.

3035
02:25:04,310 --> 02:25:06,690
Oh no.

3036
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:19,140
Fuck, there was no way.

3037
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:20,580
Oh my god, we got thirded.

3038
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:24,760
The sound is even worse this season.

3039
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,840
That's good to know.

3040
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:30,820
Cool.

3041
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:34,740
Oh man, whole squad and only heard one.

3042
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:37,240
Yeah, we lost one guy instantly.

3043
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:39,000
That was unlucky.

3044
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:42,560
Jesus Christ, this game got a lot harder.

3045
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,500
I need to lock it in.

3046
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:46,240
I just want one.

3047
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:47,140
Okay.

3048
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:49,480
Alright guys, I'm gonna lock in.

3049
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:50,860
I can't fuck around anymore.

3050
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,060
I need to lock in.

3051
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:55,700
I'm gonna lock in guys.

3052
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:57,400
Alright, serious derky time.

3053
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:59,780
Serious derky time.

3054
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:03,000
Alright.

3055
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:05,640
This is it.

3056
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:09,220
This is it.

3057
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:09,860
This is fine.

3058
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:11,280
I can be serious.

3059
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:14,560
I can be serious now.

3060
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:18,160
I can fucking do this.

3061
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:18,720
Guys!

3062
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:20,840
I can do this.

3063
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:22,440
I need you guys to believe in me.

3064
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:25,400
I also need you guys to believe in me too, guys.

3065
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,340
Guys, I can't do this without you guys.

3066
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:34,100
You guys gotta believe in me too.

3067
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,220
Give me your energy.

3068
02:26:38,060 --> 02:26:39,200
That was unlucky though.

3069
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:40,220
We're going straight down.

3070
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:41,220
I can't be bothered.

3071
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:43,400
I cannot be bothered.

3072
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:44,500
We're going fucking straight down.

3073
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,060
We're in bronze.

3074
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:48,960
If you guys cry about landing straight down, get a high ELO.

3075
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:51,860
I cannot be bothered.

3076
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:54,160
You don't even lose anything.

3077
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:57,460
We're just here to fight.

3078
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:00,340
I need out of here.

3079
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:06,500
Oh, my random isn't even alive.

3080
02:27:09,690 --> 02:27:11,850
My random isn't even alive, guys.

3081
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:13,970
She's not locked in.

3082
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:16,370
She's not even locked in.

3083
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:18,910
She's not even here.

3084
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:26,470
It's already over before we even landed.

3085
02:27:27,610 --> 02:27:29,010
What the fuck?

3086
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:31,830
Oh, man.

3087
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:34,550
That's rough.

3088
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:40,810
Our random's down here.

3089
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:46,360
Is she still AFK?

3090
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:48,420
Okay, guys, this is not the match.

3091
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:52,360
Guys, I realize this might not be the match where we're locked in.

3092
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,720
Our third isn't even alive.

3093
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:56,760
Alright, thank you!

3094
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:03,440
Our third isn't even alive!

3095
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,760
Oh, my God.

3096
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:07,680
Lord, grossest.

3097
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:09,800
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3098
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:11,320
Thank you, thank you.

3099
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:14,160
Alright, I guess we leave, I guess.

3100
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:17,240
Who would've thought we're just gonna leave like that?

3101
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,380
I wanna fight them.

3102
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:20,400
I think we can fight.

3103
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:21,180
No, nevermind.

3104
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:24,000
My other guy cannot fight this.

3105
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:25,520
Nevermind.

3106
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:27,000
Thank you for the Akasupa.

3107
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:28,140
Thank you, thank you.

3108
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:30,480
This is all of my current energy.

3109
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:34,480
Guys, I have a feeling that my third can't do this either.

3110
02:28:34,480 --> 02:28:35,600
There it is!

3111
02:28:36,980 --> 02:28:40,300
I was hopeful until, like, you know...

3112
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:43,620
Until I saw him get absolutely demolished.

3113
02:28:44,220 --> 02:28:45,880
Okay, they're flying to us.

3114
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:09,990
Let's see.

3115
02:29:10,410 --> 02:29:11,830
I'm gonna try and fight this.

3116
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,580
Okay.

3117
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:20,200
They actually wanna fight, fight.

3118
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:20,680
Okay.

3119
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:22,780
Where are they?

3120
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:26,380
Behind me.

3121
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:36,570
Okay, you cannot- Oh my god.

3122
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:49,620
I'm trying to figure out where they are.

3123
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:51,120
Okay.

3124
02:29:52,260 --> 02:29:55,060
They're just taking, like, 20 different off-angles.

3125
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:56,760
Like, what the fuck?

3126
02:29:58,920 --> 02:29:59,660
Oh my god.

3127
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:04,320
Oh my god.

3128
02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:09,750
THIS IS ANOTHER SQUAD?!

3129
02:30:10,990 --> 02:30:11,710
Okay.

3130
02:30:11,710 --> 02:30:11,850
Okay.

3131
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:20,440
You're such a fucker.

3132
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:24,480
You're actually- You're such a- Oh my god.

3133
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:27,800
If I wasn't 1 HP, I'd kill this guy.

3134
02:30:35,340 --> 02:30:37,300
I had no third.

3135
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:41,420
And then we get- AND THEN THEY LIVE?!

3136
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:45,040
WHAT?!

3137
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:46,200
They live.

3138
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:48,500
THEY LIVE!

3139
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:52,260
My third being AFK sealed it.

3140
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:56,800
Okay, now, this should be the game where I can lock it in.

3141
02:30:57,380 --> 02:31:00,540
This should be the game where I lock it in.

3142
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:02,200
There is no god.

3143
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:04,820
GOD WILL SHOW UP FOR THIS GAME.

3144
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:08,420
GOD WILL SHOW UP FOR THIS GAME.

3145
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:11,820
Alright.

3146
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:12,640
Alright.

3147
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:16,360
Valdo, thank you- I need to remember to use my Q.

3148
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:21,060
My Q is what's been killing me a lot, too, because I keep forgetting to use Q and stuff.

3149
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:23,500
Valdo, thank you for the super chat!

3150
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:24,540
Thank you, thank you!

3151
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:31,400
Hey Doki, for my birthday today, I wish for you to continue being the best of the best and for you and Mint to prove you're the best duo in YouTuber history.

3152
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:34,420
Also, please don't doubt yourself and make your success persist.

3153
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:35,540
Thank you for the super chat!

3154
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:36,540
Thank you, thank you!

3155
02:31:36,740 --> 02:31:38,360
Happy birthday to you.

3156
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:40,300
Happy birthday to you.

3157
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:42,580
Happy birthday, dear Valdo.

3158
02:31:42,740 --> 02:31:44,360
Happy birthday to you.

3159
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:45,060
Yeah!

3160
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,120
Happy birthday!

3161
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:47,840
Okay, we lock in.

3162
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:50,500
This is where we actually lock in.

3163
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:55,100
This is- This is it.

3164
02:31:55,740 --> 02:32:01,280
Give me- Give me capacitor, because they- Okay, I'm going to go for capacitor, because there's a light.

3165
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,360
I need that light ammo.

3166
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:05,660
I need that light ammo.

3167
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Sticking bin.

3168
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:09,540
I'm literally just doing this for light ammo.

3169
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:11,800
That's really it for the light guns.

3170
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:15,300
For guarantee R9, I don't fucking care about anything else.

3171
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:20,020
Legit, I'm just- I'm literally just going in for the R9.

3172
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:25,660
It sucks I don't have like a jump animation for Ashe, though.

3173
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:30,540
I need this R9, I need this R9, I need this R9.

3174
02:32:34,390 --> 02:32:36,650
Legit, I'm only going for R9s.

3175
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:41,110
Okay, here we go.

3176
02:32:46,670 --> 02:32:49,670
Oh my god, I'm getting better at using her jumps, though, at least.

3177
02:32:49,810 --> 02:32:51,870
I need to learn how to use her fucking Q.

3178
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:55,850
That's like- That's been like my- Oh, I need a room to upgrade to.

3179
02:32:56,690 --> 02:32:58,270
Let me upgrade my light gun.

3180
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:07,030
Give me my upgrades, give me my upgrades!

3181
02:33:10,870 --> 02:33:12,170
I'm going to make sure there's nobody.

3182
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:13,850
Nice!

3183
02:33:13,850 --> 02:33:14,270
Enhanced.

3184
02:33:14,810 --> 02:33:15,450
Do I have any grenades?

3185
02:33:15,530 --> 02:33:15,970
I do.

3186
02:33:17,630 --> 02:33:19,950
I don't want to run Carbine R9, though.

3187
02:33:22,850 --> 02:33:25,990
But if I have to...

3188
02:33:25,990 --> 02:33:27,150
I'll put this here.

3189
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:34,590
There's no long range gun I want.

3190
02:33:35,890 --> 02:33:37,210
I mean, I could grab the Mastiff.

3191
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:38,290
I'll grab the Mastiff.

3192
02:33:38,770 --> 02:33:40,450
The blue bar is my dash cooldown.

3193
02:33:42,010 --> 02:33:42,510
Wait, what?

3194
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:46,330
Where's- Where is- Here?

3195
02:33:51,580 --> 02:33:52,880
I'm looking for you.

3196
02:33:58,100 --> 02:33:59,540
Trying to cover for him.

3197
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:11,220
I don't know if they're going to push, though.

3198
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:14,520
I don't think they're going to push now.

3199
02:34:15,580 --> 02:34:16,540
Okay, guys.

3200
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:17,740
Guys, chill, chill.

3201
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:22,740
I'm literally here to- I'm literally here to, like, back you guys up.

3202
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:28,400
Oh my god.

3203
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:31,040
That was such a good shot from them.

3204
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:33,220
Jesus Christ.

3205
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:34,460
Wait, these guys are crazy.

3206
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:37,720
Fuck, okay.

3207
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:45,710
Oh,

3208
02:34:50,230 --> 02:34:51,310
I'm one- No!

3209
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:53,770
Oh my god!

3210
02:34:54,810 --> 02:34:56,950
I was- He already got headshot on me.

3211
02:34:57,010 --> 02:34:57,950
I couldn't do anything.

3212
02:34:59,110 --> 02:35:00,670
He was insane on the wing.

3213
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:02,390
That guy was insane on the wing, man.

3214
02:35:02,410 --> 02:35:03,770
I was too far.

3215
02:35:04,610 --> 02:35:06,130
Trying to get that cross angle.

3216
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:07,650
Yeah, we did not live that.

3217
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:10,850
That guy hit, like, three wingman shots on me.

3218
02:35:11,210 --> 02:35:13,810
Like, I was not living because there's no helmets anymore.

3219
02:35:16,470 --> 02:35:18,030
That guy was insane.

3220
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:19,490
He hit three wingman shots.

3221
02:35:21,210 --> 02:35:27,490
He did three wingman shots on me, and we had no helmet, and I was like, I can't heal this in time.

3222
02:35:28,430 --> 02:35:29,010
No heals.

3223
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:35,350
No fucking heals for that.

3224
02:35:36,090 --> 02:35:39,710
I think, like, if our lifeline didn't get knocked, it would have been doable.

3225
02:35:39,870 --> 02:35:42,730
But she got knocked first, so that was bad.

3226
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:44,510
It's better or worse?

3227
02:35:44,610 --> 02:35:45,530
I think it's worse.

3228
02:35:45,990 --> 02:35:49,870
I've always hated lower- My biggest gripe?

3229
02:35:50,490 --> 02:35:54,210
I've always hated video games that have very low TTK.

3230
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:57,550
Because, like, there's less outplayability.

3231
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:02,330
There's less outplayability, and it just makes it feel like Call of Duty.

3232
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:05,430
Like, it might as well just be, like, COD slash Battlefield.

3233
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:10,550
And, like, I never- I don't like that.

3234
02:36:11,190 --> 02:36:12,490
No room to adapt.

3235
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:12,850
Yeah.

3236
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:19,170
Like, legitimately, I just got- I got three tapped by a wingman, and I couldn't play the game.

3237
02:36:19,690 --> 02:36:22,550
Like, I peeked that guy for one second, and...

3238
02:36:23,690 --> 02:36:28,630
I looked at that guy for one second, and then I had to heal.

3239
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:31,410
Yeah.

3240
02:36:31,890 --> 02:36:33,790
So, like, it was just not it.

3241
02:36:36,030 --> 02:36:37,490
It was over after that.

3242
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:40,510
I never, like- That's why I don't like tactical shooters.

3243
02:36:41,210 --> 02:36:47,230
I've hated tactical shooters, because the short TTK is just very frustrating.

3244
02:36:47,490 --> 02:36:49,370
Because there's no outplayability for it.

3245
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:51,090
I'm just going for anywhere that has light ammo.

3246
02:36:52,910 --> 02:36:57,750
Yeah, like, I- It sucks, because there's literally zero play- Like, it's hard to adapt.

3247
02:36:58,150 --> 02:36:59,630
That's, like, the hardest part.

3248
02:37:00,230 --> 02:37:02,210
When you can't adapt to a situation.

3249
02:37:03,570 --> 02:37:05,050
We will get the light gun!

3250
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:06,270
We won't get it first, guys.

3251
02:37:06,370 --> 02:37:07,110
We won't get it first.

3252
02:37:07,170 --> 02:37:07,610
I'm sorry.

3253
02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:10,650
I left them to die.

3254
02:37:10,790 --> 02:37:12,530
I got- I still got an R9, though.

3255
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:15,870
I might have left them to die, but I got an R9.

3256
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:19,840
Like, look at that!

3257
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:21,860
Literally, so fast.

3258
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:24,640
So fast.

3259
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,000
Um, where's that guy?

3260
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:35,390
Crawl!

3261
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:36,820
Just crawl!

3262
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:38,220
What are you doing?!

3263
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:40,020
Okay.

3264
02:37:44,020 --> 02:37:46,440
Bro, this guy's fucking stupid.

3265
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:50,460
Yoshi, I'm sorry.

3266
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:52,780
You're not.

3267
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:55,460
Thank you, Carl.

3268
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:59,920
If you were sorry, you would have crawled so I could have rez you easily.

3269
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:04,420
Alright.

3270
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:07,540
That's right.

3271
02:38:07,660 --> 02:38:09,920
This is your first- Look at that.

3272
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,060
This was his first fucking impression for me.

3273
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:17,460
And he didn't- He stayed in the fucking open and forced me to punch him to cover.

3274
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:22,460
You think a punch is gonna stop anything?!

3275
02:38:24,580 --> 02:38:27,120
You think apologies stop the war?!

3276
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:28,720
No, it didn't!

3277
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:31,360
And he took the massive, too?!

3278
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:38,820
I need to wait for the massive.

3279
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:41,360
There you go.

3280
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:45,900
Alright.

3281
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:48,840
He's already got my massive.

3282
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:49,540
It's too late.

3283
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:50,740
There's no more forgiveness.

3284
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,680
I don't- I can't forgive anymore.

3285
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:55,420
I know!

3286
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:08,360
I have a massive.

3287
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:13,020
There is no mercy.

3288
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:20,580
If he fucks up one last time, I give him one more chance and then this is what's gonna happen.

3289
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:29,540
He has one more chance to impress me.

3290
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:32,720
And then this is what's gonna- Apparently it's a dragon.

3291
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:35,560
Or that's gonna happen.

3292
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:39,820
Alright.

3293
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:41,320
One last chance.

3294
02:39:41,820 --> 02:39:43,500
I have to take cover so fast.

3295
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:45,980
Because the TTK is so fast.

3296
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:52,340
I legitimately- I can't even like- I feel like I can't even like- I don't wanna ult there.

3297
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:54,540
I feel like it's so dangerous to ult there.

3298
02:39:54,740 --> 02:39:55,620
I've ulted high ground.

3299
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:57,580
Alright.

3300
02:39:57,740 --> 02:40:03,260
I either die for this or I do like a quick-

3301
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:15,470
That TTK is so fucking crazy.

3302
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:16,270
Holy shit.

3303
02:40:16,330 --> 02:40:17,830
My team is already almost dead.

3304
02:40:21,770 --> 02:40:24,610
My team is almost dead already.

3305
02:40:24,830 --> 02:40:26,130
What the fuck?

3306
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:29,410
What the fuck is going on?

3307
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:35,900
Another squad?

3308
02:40:36,200 --> 02:40:37,620
Okay, this is another team.

3309
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:38,920
Okay.

3310
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:44,040
This is a new team.

3311
02:40:51,950 --> 02:40:53,450
I'm sorry, Horizon.

3312
02:40:53,890 --> 02:40:55,090
I'm so sorry.

3313
02:40:55,950 --> 02:40:57,630
I'm not fighting this.

3314
02:40:57,830 --> 02:40:58,730
I'm so sorry.

3315
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:01,910
This is a new team.

3316
02:41:02,410 --> 02:41:04,250
I'm just gonna go straight to crafting.

3317
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:12,150
You better die so I can- Okay, there we go.

3318
02:41:17,230 --> 02:41:22,810
Like- I was like- Two teams?

3319
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:23,530
Yeah.

3320
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:25,210
That ain't it.

3321
02:41:26,830 --> 02:41:28,010
There we go.

3322
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:29,250
Welcome back.

3323
02:41:32,930 --> 02:41:35,550
I heard two teams and I was like- Yep.

3324
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:40,170
This is where we're gonna die.

3325
02:41:40,510 --> 02:41:42,310
I'm just gonna go to zone.

3326
02:41:42,490 --> 02:41:44,290
I'm not fight- I'm not fighting in zone.

3327
02:41:44,530 --> 02:41:45,770
Like, fuck that shit.

3328
02:41:48,910 --> 02:41:50,610
I'm not fighting in zone.

3329
02:41:51,050 --> 02:41:52,730
I'm not crazy enough for that.

3330
02:41:53,390 --> 02:41:55,490
I'm going to enhance my R9 though.

3331
02:41:58,410 --> 02:42:01,130
Oh, I hope they have enough meds.

3332
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:07,740
I hope they all have enough meds for this.

3333
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:11,100
Cause it'd be a shame if they- They might not.

3334
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:13,140
Actually, I think my team might die in zone.

3335
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:13,920
I think.

3336
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:16,820
They might die in zone.

3337
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:17,880
Whoops.

3338
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,140
My bad.

3339
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:24,340
I don't think they do have enough meds.

3340
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:25,320
Yeah, there's no way.

3341
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:26,280
I don't think they do.

3342
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:31,080
Yeah, no, they don't.

3343
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:31,900
They don't.

3344
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:33,120
There's no way.

3345
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:37,880
I'm gonna live.

3346
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:45,080
I know who's living.

3347
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,280
And it's me.

3348
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:52,000
Oh shit!

3349
02:42:52,260 --> 02:42:52,820
No, wait!

3350
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:53,380
Wait!

3351
02:42:54,580 --> 02:42:56,000
Wait, let me live first!

3352
02:42:56,340 --> 02:43:00,200
Let me- And it's me.

3353
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:04,860
It's still me.

3354
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:06,840
It's still me, by the way.

3355
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:07,660
It's still me.

3356
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:09,120
Yeah, it's still me.

3357
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:18,380
Karma real- It's still me though, by the way.

3358
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:19,100
It's still me.

3359
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:19,900
I still live.

3360
02:43:20,460 --> 02:43:21,140
I still live.

3361
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,320
I just don't have meds.

3362
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:23,440
But it's still me.

3363
02:43:26,900 --> 02:43:28,040
Spoke too soon.

3364
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:30,800
It's still me, guys.

3365
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:31,600
It's still me.

3366
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:34,360
Maybe there's extra meds here.

3367
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:38,980
I'm surprised they found enough syringes.

3368
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:42,120
Where the fuck do they find all these syringes?

3369
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:44,300
Oh, nice.

3370
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:48,180
Oh, nice.

3371
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:48,940
We still live.

3372
02:43:50,180 --> 02:43:52,680
This has been the most scuffed game of my life.

3373
02:43:53,220 --> 02:43:55,900
I feel like a medic more than an actual player.

3374
02:44:00,590 --> 02:44:08,570
I hear gunshots there and I really want- I have one syringe so I'm not giving them that syringe.

3375
02:44:10,070 --> 02:44:12,030
Wait, we're missing one person.

3376
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:16,780
See, I can get this kill.

3377
02:44:17,380 --> 02:44:18,260
Or do you think I'll die?

3378
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:19,680
Time to find out!

3379
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:21,440
This way.

3380
02:44:23,420 --> 02:44:25,840
I thought they were closer.

3381
02:44:42,890 --> 02:44:43,150
Nice.

3382
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:46,530
He's dead.

3383
02:44:46,530 --> 02:44:46,590
He's dead.

3384
02:44:50,610 --> 02:44:51,630
Linganark star.

3385
02:44:52,050 --> 02:44:53,850
He says when he's dead.

3386
02:45:00,020 --> 02:45:01,080
Over there.

3387
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:05,780
I think I can surprise them.

3388
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:12,200
What the fuck?

3389
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:14,020
I don't even see a health registry.

3390
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:15,720
You guys see that?

3391
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:17,540
There was no health registry for that.

3392
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:21,060
That was weird.

3393
02:45:22,320 --> 02:45:24,140
Yeah, I can do that too!

3394
02:45:24,560 --> 02:45:25,860
Yeah, I can do this!

3395
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:28,740
And then my horizon died.

3396
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:30,180
Okay.

3397
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:46,380
I did not expect my horizon to die, but that's okay.

3398
02:45:46,980 --> 02:45:49,500
It's all about happy surprises, I guess.

3399
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:00,720
Oh shit.

3400
02:46:02,660 --> 02:46:03,740
Fuck, they're over there.

3401
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:09,160
Okay, that's cool.

3402
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:10,940
That's... yeah.

3403
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:13,780
I don't know about that.

3404
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:17,560
This is a little awkward for me.

3405
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:28,420
They're just gonna re-deploy.

3406
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:29,440
They don't care.

3407
02:46:29,620 --> 02:46:30,600
We can take their re-deploy.

3408
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:31,780
I'm gonna take their re-deploy.

3409
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:40,820
Okay.

3410
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,980
This is the only thing I can do to outplay this.

3411
02:46:45,420 --> 02:46:48,600
I might die though, but we'll see.

3412
02:46:49,220 --> 02:46:51,960
I'll run to the right side.

3413
02:46:52,850 --> 02:46:54,220
No, I'm dead.

3414
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:05,160
That's fine.

3415
02:47:18,490 --> 02:47:19,650
Come on, please.

3416
02:47:24,650 --> 02:47:25,550
Alright.

3417
02:47:26,590 --> 02:47:28,570
That's how you use movement!

3418
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:35,050
Open that, open that, open that, open that.

3419
02:47:36,470 --> 02:47:37,210
Grab this.

3420
02:47:39,230 --> 02:47:39,670
Okay.

3421
02:47:44,190 --> 02:47:45,930
I gained an extra dash, actually.

3422
02:47:47,290 --> 02:47:48,210
Oh wait, our guy died.

3423
02:47:48,390 --> 02:47:48,570
Okay.

3424
02:47:52,150 --> 02:47:52,590
Okay.

3425
02:47:54,810 --> 02:47:57,050
Let's see if I can grab some heals.

3426
02:47:58,430 --> 02:47:59,550
Bro, you just noticed.

3427
02:48:00,670 --> 02:48:01,070
Okay.

3428
02:48:02,030 --> 02:48:03,570
Let's see if we can craft him.

3429
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:05,750
Go craft this fucker.

3430
02:48:13,930 --> 02:48:15,070
Alright, I got the craft.

3431
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:16,850
Res this guy, res this guy.

3432
02:48:16,930 --> 02:48:18,570
Why is our guy right here?!

3433
02:48:18,570 --> 02:48:20,250
I thought you were gonna be at the res beacon!

3434
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:24,120
Alright.

3435
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:35,200
Oh my god, okay.

3436
02:48:35,200 --> 02:48:35,300
Okay.

3437
02:48:41,010 --> 02:48:43,420
Look at that TTK, that's actually bullshit.

3438
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:45,740
That's actually so sad.

3439
02:48:50,410 --> 02:48:51,230
Fuck!

3440
02:48:53,110 --> 02:48:54,990
That's crazy!

3441
02:48:57,810 --> 02:49:02,930
That should not be in the TTK, holy fuck.

3442
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:10,330
That's crazy!

3443
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:13,570
That should not be my TTK.

3444
02:49:15,530 --> 02:49:17,370
That's insane.

3445
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:21,270
That's so broken, that's so broken.

3446
02:49:21,410 --> 02:49:24,210
I can't, that's actually so fucking broken.

3447
02:49:29,150 --> 02:49:30,990
Jesus Christ.

3448
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:35,030
Yeah, let's keep it.

3449
02:49:36,830 --> 02:49:39,290
It's way too cranked up, it actually is.

3450
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:43,910
It's way too insane for...

3451
02:49:45,930 --> 02:49:48,010
I feel like it's just way too strong.

3452
02:49:49,230 --> 02:49:49,550
IMO.

3453
02:49:49,990 --> 02:49:50,770
Oh, okay.

3454
02:49:50,990 --> 02:49:52,650
Just take the evac, I'll just walk.

3455
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:53,350
It's fine.

3456
02:49:54,010 --> 02:49:55,390
I walk, you guys take it.

3457
02:49:56,530 --> 02:49:58,510
30 seconds before the ring closes.

3458
02:49:58,950 --> 02:49:59,830
Use it well.

3459
02:50:03,190 --> 02:50:06,230
Yeah, the moment I looked at him, he was just dead.

3460
02:50:06,430 --> 02:50:07,250
There was like...

3461
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:10,170
I think there's someone to my right and I think there's someone to my left.

3462
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:12,030
I'm gonna go left.

3463
02:50:13,150 --> 02:50:17,390
Or I go left and then right, because they have an Octane, so...

3464
02:50:25,970 --> 02:50:27,410
Okay, so...

3465
02:50:27,410 --> 02:50:28,750
Hmm, alright.

3466
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:33,250
Hmm, they're rezzing right now.

3467
02:50:34,610 --> 02:50:36,090
I'm trying to figure out how to play this.

3468
02:50:39,250 --> 02:50:41,470
I have... do I have two?

3469
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:45,670
Let's see, I have two charges, maybe.

3470
02:50:47,130 --> 02:50:47,850
Umm...

3471
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:48,650
They're over here.

3472
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:50,850
This is insane.

3473
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:52,090
Come on, come with me.

3474
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:55,150
Now we're behind them.

3475
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:00,800
Stop!

3476
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,040
Why are you in front of me?!

3477
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:03,980
Why did you stand in front of me?!

3478
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:06,140
I'm not winning this back!

3479
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:07,520
I'm so...

3480
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:08,260
Oh my god!

3481
02:51:08,780 --> 02:51:10,540
That was your last chance!

3482
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:11,720
That was...

3483
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:16,880
That was your last chance!

3484
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:23,000
I'll give you one more chance!

3485
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,900
I had you stand in front of my shots!

3486
02:51:29,720 --> 02:51:32,800
He got... he took all my back shots!

3487
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:34,000
That's actually crazy.

3488
02:51:42,520 --> 02:51:43,840
It's like...

3489
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:45,520
Okay, let's see.

3490
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:47,000
This is... zone.

3491
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:49,250
This is zone.

3492
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:51,850
This is zone.

3493
02:51:51,850 --> 02:51:53,410
And you know where they're gonna head to.

3494
02:51:53,930 --> 02:51:55,210
This is zone.

3495
02:51:55,830 --> 02:51:57,010
This is zone.

3496
02:51:57,810 --> 02:52:00,130
But they have people there too.

3497
02:52:00,530 --> 02:52:01,410
Fuck, okay.

3498
02:52:02,110 --> 02:52:05,170
I need to figure out how to maneuver this properly.

3499
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:08,170
I have the ult to maneuver this.

3500
02:52:08,930 --> 02:52:09,490
But...

3501
02:52:09,490 --> 02:52:11,250
The hard part is that...

3502
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:17,190
This is hard because they're all...

3503
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:20,190
Let's see, they're not in zone though.

3504
02:52:23,150 --> 02:52:24,410
They're literally not in zone.

3505
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:25,410
If I take... okay.

3506
02:52:25,930 --> 02:52:27,810
I might do something incredibly crazy.

3507
02:52:28,570 --> 02:52:30,490
And I could go all the way here.

3508
02:52:31,970 --> 02:52:32,510
Let's see.

3509
02:52:34,330 --> 02:52:35,430
No, they're already here.

3510
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:35,950
Never mind.

3511
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:38,550
They're already here.

3512
02:52:39,330 --> 02:52:39,930
I can't.

3513
02:52:40,070 --> 02:52:41,030
They're all like...

3514
02:52:41,030 --> 02:52:42,310
Oh my god, this is difficult.

3515
02:52:43,050 --> 02:52:46,190
They're all literally in the zone for...

3516
02:52:50,390 --> 02:52:52,450
Let's see, I'm trying to figure out where to go.

3517
02:52:54,750 --> 02:52:55,230
Okay.

3518
02:52:58,110 --> 02:52:58,590
Okay.

3519
02:52:59,190 --> 02:53:01,330
We couldn't push that because this team is here.

3520
02:53:04,990 --> 02:53:06,490
Oh, I need to figure this out.

3521
02:53:08,990 --> 02:53:11,970
These guys are dumb as fuck for doing this.

3522
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:15,250
I'm just gonna wait for the other team to push up.

3523
02:53:46,340 --> 02:53:46,780
Oh.

3524
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,720
No, no, fuck!

3525
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:55,120
I queued into zone.

3526
02:53:55,480 --> 02:53:56,340
I queued into...

3527
02:53:56,340 --> 02:53:57,820
Res me, res me, res me, res me right here.

3528
02:53:58,120 --> 02:53:59,460
I can't believe I queued in.

3529
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:01,600
I queued into the zone.

3530
02:54:01,820 --> 02:54:03,480
Oh my god, I got two of those.

3531
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:04,260
1v2.

3532
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:12,780
I can't believe I actually queued into the zone.

3533
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:17,140
It's 1v1, it's a 1v1.

3534
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:23,180
I was like trying to figure out where the area was.

3535
02:54:24,580 --> 02:54:24,940
Alright.

3536
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:26,740
Havoc is broken as fuck though.

3537
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:27,580
I'm fucking running in.

3538
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:34,000
Okay.

3539
02:54:43,890 --> 02:54:45,940
The Havoc is so dumb.

3540
02:54:48,750 --> 02:54:51,480
The Havoc is actually so dumb.

3541
02:54:51,880 --> 02:54:52,740
Holy shit.

3542
02:54:52,980 --> 02:54:58,120
He didn't look at me one time and everyone's dead.

3543
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:02,560
It's so dumb.

3544
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:04,140
Oh my god.

3545
02:55:04,420 --> 02:55:05,740
I think it really...

3546
02:55:05,740 --> 02:55:06,800
I just need a Havoc.

3547
02:55:07,060 --> 02:55:07,760
That...

3548
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:09,480
If like I can do that.

3549
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:12,820
If I could do that with a Havoc.

3550
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:13,880
And like...

3551
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:15,300
Like...

3552
02:55:15,300 --> 02:55:17,760
And I'm like super washed.

3553
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:19,320
That...

3554
02:55:19,320 --> 02:55:23,860
Imagine if like a controller player, pro player holds a Havoc.

3555
02:55:24,080 --> 02:55:24,800
That's...

3556
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:25,860
Holy fuck.

3557
02:55:26,240 --> 02:55:29,000
That gun is busted as hell.

3558
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:30,900
Oh my god.

3559
02:55:30,900 --> 02:55:31,840
Yeah.

3560
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:33,800
I literally...

3561
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:35,200
1v...

3562
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:35,560
Like...

3563
02:55:35,560 --> 02:55:38,760
I literally like 1v3'd a Havoc.

3564
02:55:38,860 --> 02:55:40,980
And all I did was just stayed on high ground.

3565
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:43,020
Oh my god.

3566
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,040
The damage output is insane.

3567
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:47,860
Yeah.

3568
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:49,140
Oh my...

3569
02:55:49,140 --> 02:55:49,400
Okay.

3570
02:55:49,640 --> 02:55:50,680
We did it guys.

3571
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:52,000
We fucking did it.

3572
02:55:52,060 --> 02:55:52,620
We got it.

3573
02:55:55,880 --> 02:55:57,480
That gun is...

3574
02:55:57,480 --> 02:55:59,720
That gun is busted as fuck.

3575
02:55:59,720 --> 02:56:01,520
That gun is so busted.

3576
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:02,160
Yeah.

3577
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:06,280
More follows.

3578
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:07,040
Thank you for the super chat.

3579
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:07,340
Thank you.

3580
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:07,840
Thank you.

3581
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:10,860
It reminds me that launching season 6 also has the same issue.

3582
02:56:11,240 --> 02:56:14,060
Hope they have fixes like when they did in that season 2.

3583
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:15,160
Thank you for the super chat.

3584
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:15,540
Thank you.

3585
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:16,160
Thank you.

3586
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:16,800
Gaming.

3587
02:56:16,940 --> 02:56:18,220
Thank you for the 5 gift wishes.

3588
02:56:18,380 --> 02:56:18,600
Thank you.

3589
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:19,020
Thank you.

3590
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:19,520
Fire.

3591
02:56:19,720 --> 02:56:20,460
Thank you for the super chat.

3592
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:20,800
Thank you.

3593
02:56:20,820 --> 02:56:21,040
Thank you.

3594
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:22,580
Nice win after the fumble.

3595
02:56:22,760 --> 02:56:24,660
That's our Doki mess up.

3596
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:25,680
And...

3597
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,700
And I Q'd into the zone.

3598
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:28,780
I was like...

3599
02:56:28,780 --> 02:56:29,480
I'll be safe.

3600
02:56:29,740 --> 02:56:30,380
And then my...

3601
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:30,920
And then my...

3602
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:32,640
My Z was like...

3603
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:33,220
Wait a minute.

3604
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:35,980
That Z is going a little too far.

3605
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:39,660
I was like...

3606
02:56:39,660 --> 02:56:41,040
Wait a minute.

3607
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:44,460
I saw myself go into the red.

3608
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:45,840
And I was like...

3609
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:46,780
Oh no.

3610
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:48,740
And then like the...

3611
02:56:51,020 --> 02:56:53,160
That's when you know you fucked up.

3612
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:57,400
Thank you for the 10 gift wishes.

3613
02:56:57,400 --> 02:56:58,060
Thank you.

3614
02:56:58,100 --> 02:56:58,640
Thank you.

3615
02:56:58,740 --> 02:57:01,620
Yeah, I went in a little too far.

3616
02:57:04,360 --> 02:57:05,960
See, welcome to Tomeo5.

3617
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:06,220
Welcome.

3618
02:57:06,420 --> 02:57:06,840
Oh, yep.

3619
02:57:07,660 --> 02:57:08,700
It's gonna end it on a win.

3620
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:10,040
We finally got that win.

3621
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:11,720
Like I said, honest opinion.

3622
02:57:11,940 --> 02:57:14,400
I hate the fact that they lowered the...

3623
02:57:16,860 --> 02:57:22,660
I hate the fact that they lowered the time to kill.

3624
02:57:23,860 --> 02:57:24,340
Because...

3625
02:57:24,340 --> 02:57:25,340
Because it's...

3626
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:25,960
I don't know.

3627
02:57:25,960 --> 02:57:26,560
It just...

3628
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:29,340
I feel like it makes the game...

3629
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:31,000
Just...

3630
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:32,120
It's just so hard.

3631
02:57:32,300 --> 02:57:34,040
It just makes the game much more harder.

3632
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:35,640
Because there's no...

3633
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:37,980
I feel like it's really hard to outplay.

3634
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:39,340
It's just...

3635
02:57:39,340 --> 02:57:42,160
It just feels like Call of Duty slash Battlefield.

3636
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:43,400
Which I understand.

3637
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:45,180
Because they want more fights.

3638
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:46,460
They really want more fights.

3639
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:50,180
But if I peak one second and I'm fucking out of the game.

3640
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:51,300
Like I...

3641
02:57:51,300 --> 02:57:52,360
It's just not fun.

3642
02:57:52,480 --> 02:57:54,540
Like I don't wanna just be healing all the time.

3643
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:54,960
Yeah.

3644
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,300
Like if there's no...

3645
02:57:57,300 --> 02:57:59,620
Like if you're not the first person to initiate.

3646
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:01,420
Then like you lose.

3647
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:03,980
Like I literally...

3648
02:58:03,980 --> 02:58:06,000
I peaked my head one time and I was like...

3649
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:06,980
What time to heal?

3650
02:58:09,060 --> 02:58:10,100
I feel like...

3651
02:58:10,100 --> 02:58:11,340
I know a lot of people are now playing...

3652
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:11,980
What's that game called?

3653
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:12,860
Delta Force?

3654
02:58:13,940 --> 02:58:15,340
Was it Delta Force?

3655
02:58:15,580 --> 02:58:16,740
Where it's the similar?

3656
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:18,240
Because I think they're trying...

3657
02:58:18,240 --> 02:58:20,840
I know like Delta Force is getting really popular as well.

3658
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:22,860
For people who like to play Call of Duty and stuff like that.

3659
02:58:23,060 --> 02:58:24,060
But I feel like...

3660
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:24,880
I feel like...

3661
02:58:24,880 --> 02:58:25,540
You know...

3662
02:58:26,660 --> 02:58:28,440
Apex can be it's own game.

3663
02:58:28,580 --> 02:58:30,040
With it's own like...

3664
02:58:30,040 --> 02:58:30,780
You know...

3665
02:58:32,460 --> 02:58:34,080
With it's own like...

3666
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:34,960
You know...

3667
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:36,920
Basically you can...

3668
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:38,060
You can like...

3669
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:40,180
I feel like there should be more availability.

3670
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:40,960
I really do.

3671
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:42,260
Right Chris?

3672
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:43,120
Thank you for the super chat.

3673
02:58:43,240 --> 02:58:43,400
Thank you.

3674
02:58:43,480 --> 02:58:43,720
Thank you.

3675
02:58:43,780 --> 02:58:45,360
Thanks for the character.

3676
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:47,420
Oh you liked your back shots.

3677
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:48,420
I didn't.

3678
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:51,420
I could've got a kill there.

3679
02:58:51,420 --> 02:58:55,200
Thank you for your very first super chat.

3680
02:58:55,400 --> 02:58:56,600
Thank you, thank you.

3681
02:58:57,980 --> 02:58:59,560
Thank you for the super chat.

3682
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:00,200
Thank you, thank you.

3683
02:59:00,420 --> 02:59:01,340
It feels like Valorant.

3684
02:59:01,400 --> 02:59:03,500
Yeah, that's why I never liked tactical shooters.

3685
02:59:03,860 --> 02:59:04,820
Just cause I...

3686
02:59:05,410 --> 02:59:06,720
Just cause I hate...

3687
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,980
I like games where you can live longer.

3688
02:59:09,340 --> 02:59:10,660
That's basically it.

3689
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:12,300
But like...

3690
02:59:12,300 --> 02:59:13,080
Ash is fun.

3691
02:59:13,220 --> 02:59:14,020
I would admit.

3692
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:16,160
Ash is really, really fun to play.

3693
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:19,940
I would say that.

3694
02:59:20,020 --> 02:59:20,960
I enjoyed that.

3695
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:21,840
I just...

3696
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:22,200
I...

3697
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:25,940
I just didn't enjoy how I felt like I was playing Healing Simulator.

3698
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:28,740
Like it definitely rewards positioning a lot.

3699
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:31,740
Cause like I had to like stop being like stupid.

3700
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:33,060
Like I had to...

3701
02:59:33,060 --> 02:59:35,160
I had to actually play...

3702
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:37,980
Like I had to play like a fucking rat more.

3703
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:39,200
So...

3704
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:41,220
So like that's what like...

3705
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:43,080
I had to change my play style.

3706
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:44,020
Cause like I couldn't...

3707
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:45,960
I couldn't like misposition.

3708
02:59:46,700 --> 02:59:49,360
Because the moment I mispositioned it was fucking over.

3709
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:53,780
Um...

3710
02:59:53,780 --> 02:59:54,560
Um...

3711
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:55,300
But yes, anyway.

3712
02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:56,340
Before I go.

3713
02:59:56,640 --> 02:59:57,440
Before I go.

3714
02:59:57,580 --> 02:59:58,840
Let me show...

3715
02:59:58,840 --> 02:59:59,680

Get that blood flowing.
