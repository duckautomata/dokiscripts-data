1
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,330
Oh, hello, everybody.

2
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,810
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,710
Oh my god, it's been a very long day.

4
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:59,670
I started my day since... I started my day at like 10 in the morning.

5
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,670
And then I can't really say what I was doing.

6
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,190
Okay, so 10am, I had to give dad to the dog sitter.

7
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,470
Because I've... He was supposed to get a... He was supposed to get a check-up.

8
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,230
Re-check-up today.

9
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,890
But then the event rescheduled, Byron's already paid for the dog sitter.

10
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,550
So I was like, I'll just have you... Have him be taken care of by the dog sitter for a bit.

11
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,670
Just so I can relax.

12
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,970
By relaxing, I mean just so I can focus on work stuff.

13
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,190
So it started at 10 in the morning.

14
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,530
And then from... I can't say exactly what time.

15
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,650
But I can't say exactly what I was doing until tomorrow.

16
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,030
If that gives any indication as to what I was doing.

17
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,930
But it was related to the stream that's tomorrow.

18
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,190
Because obviously, you know, the game's technically not released yet.

19
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,010
So I can't say what I was doing.

20
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,890
And then... And then... So with Zen and Naimu.

21
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,750
And then... So I can't do a super long stream today.

22
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,810
Because right after today, I have to go back to what I was doing.

23
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,170
That's related to tomorrow.

24
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,830
So I'm... I'm a little tired.

25
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,650
And my hands hurt.

26
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,470
Not hurt.

27
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,930
But like... My hands are a little sore.

28
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,350
From holding a controller.

29
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,230
I...

30
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,810
It's... It's a little sore.

31
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:44,810
It's... So... So I... So that's all I can say really about it.

32
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,390
But I can't... Can't say much.

33
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,750
But like... Hint, Hint.

34
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,050
Um... Anyway...

35
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,050
Um... Dad update.

36
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,810
So...

37
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,170
Taking Dad to the dog park was a fucking mistake.

38
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,930
Like... Why you ask?

39
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,270
Well... He has learned... Dad has learned...

40
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,250
That when we are at a dog park...

41
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,450
The other... Owners... At the dog park...

42
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,350
He realizes that...

43
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,410
The other owners at the dog park...

44
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,930
Have treats on them.

45
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,770
So now...

46
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,810
All he does... Whenever I take him to the dog park...

47
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,850
And he sees...

48
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,830
People there.

49
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,350
All he does...

50
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,210
Is he goes up to the owners...

51
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,210
And just sits there.

52
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,110
And be like... Yes!

53
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,170
Do you wanna pet me?

54
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,530
I know you do.

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,530
Oh, you think these pets... Oh, the first one's free.

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,630
Oh, but I know you have a treat there.

57
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:46,310
Oh, now, don't you want to give me a treat, too?

58
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,350
Yes, he goes up to, like, random pet owners.

59
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,130
And he, like, begs them for treats.

60
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,270
And they'll be like, oh, I'll be like, I'm sorry.

61
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,410
Sorry.

62
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,110
He's already eaten.

63
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,350
He's just really food motivated.

64
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,110
I'm so sorry.

65
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,210
And then when they refuse to give him treats, he starts getting mad.

66
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,090
He starts, like, sitting there looking at them and barking at them.

67
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,170
He's like, I know you have treats, bitch.

68
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,870
And then, you know, they'll give, like, one or two treats.

69
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,230
And then he's like, more!

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,330
More!

71
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:26,510
More!

72
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,490
I know you have an entire bag of them!

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,210
More!

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,630
And he just barks at them.

75
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,230
He's like, yeah!

76
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,450
And then it sucks because, um...

77
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,910
Like, because I'm like, please, I just... I need you to poop, please.

78
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,750
I'm here because you pee... Like, he would pee instantly.

79
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,330
And then after he pees, he goes straight to, like...

80
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,690
He's like, don't hold out on me!

81
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,210
I know you have more!

82
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,330
And then he would, like, go... Like, instantly pees.

83
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,190
And then, like, he goes over to, like, some of the owners and be like, come on!

84
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,590
You wanna pet me?

85
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,530
You wanna pet me?

86
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,790
Yeah, the first one's free.

87
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,590
Oh, you wanna pet me a second time?

88
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,730
No, no, no.

89
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,190
You gotta pay for that.

90
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:07,670
You gotta...

91
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,250
He's like...

92
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,550
He's sitting there, he's, like, looking up, he's like, yeah, you want a second pet?

93
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,390
No, no, you gotta pay for that.

94
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,270
You know, I can smell it on you.

95
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,630
And you know how, like, you can smell the treats on these owners, too?

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,790
I'm so embarrassed.

97
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,690
I look every...

98
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,170
It's, like, almost every day now.

99
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:27,970
It's...

100
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,450
Bell, welcome to Domino Fire!

101
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,450
Welcome, welcome!

102
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,990
Racksheet, thank you for the super chat.

103
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,810
Thank you, thank you.

104
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,450
On a scale of 1 to 10.

105
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,810
I'm so embarrassed.

106
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,230
Because I always have to, like, apologize.

107
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,970
I'd be like, I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,970
Like...

109
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,870
And then, like, one...

110
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,850
It's because, like...

111
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,570
It didn't get that bad.

112
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,750
But one lady...

113
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,850
Kept giving him more...

114
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,370
And more treats.

115
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,750
And then she gave him her entire bag...

116
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,130
Little baggie of treats.

117
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,630
And now he knows.

118
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,790
He knows...

119
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,150
He can break them.

120
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,130
Like...

121
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,990
Ever since...

122
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,550
That lady...

123
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,330
Gave him an entire bag...

124
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,250
Of doggy treats.

125
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,950
After he, like, broke him.

126
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,870
After she...

127
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,590
He, like, broke her.

128
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,930
He knows now.

129
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,730
He...

130
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,690
He knows.

131
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,630
He can...

132
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,710
He can break them.

133
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,710
He...

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,390
Beg the people for treats.

135
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,930
So, he'll just, like, shimmy around the person.

136
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,970
Until, like...

137
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,670
I could pick him up.

138
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,790
Like, it's so...

139
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,210
He knows, too.

140
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:58,970
He knows.

141
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,430
I'm like...

142
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,910
It's over.

143
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,290
Look.

144
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,930
It's over.

145
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,490
It's over.

146
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,650
Like...

147
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,110
Gotta pick you up now.

148
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,870
He's like...

149
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,270
No.

150
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,990
No.

151
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,010
I can break him.

152
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,430
He's always two steps ahead of me.

153
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,730
Um...

154
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,010
But, yeah.

155
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,310
So, like, he...

156
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,590
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,990
He's, like, learned...

158
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,290
He's learned that they...

159
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,210
Like, 90% of the time...

160
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,530
They carry treats.

161
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,770
So, now he's like...

162
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,510
Oh, my God.

163
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,630
I don't know what to do.

164
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,210
I am...

165
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:36,970
Anyway.

166
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,890
That's the dad update for the day.

167
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,310
Um...

168
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,930
Um...

169
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,290
Oh, yeah.

170
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,070
By the way.

171
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,610
Uh...

172
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,690
So, um...

173
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,210
You guys saw that I...

174
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,050
To this week's member stream is...

175
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,490
Uh...

176
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,170
Roblox.

177
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,490
It's because during FanimeCon...

178
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,490
I got inspired by a dragoon...

179
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,850
That visited the meet and greet.

180
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,970
And he was like...

181
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,190
Yeah, I'm a Roblox developer.

182
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,050
Like, I make games on Roblox.

183
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,670
And I was like...

184
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,870
Oh, that's so cool.

185
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,370
Oh, my God.

186
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,670
Wait.

187
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,830
How much money do you make off of children?

188
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,550
And then he was like...

189
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,870
Six figures.

190
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,710
I'm like...

191
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,750
You know.

192
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,990
Very casually telling me he makes six figures off of kids.

193
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,910
So...

194
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,830
So, we're gonna...

195
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,230
We're gonna play some Roblox.

196
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,950
And we're gonna add...

197
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,730
We're gonna contribute to the dragoons.

198
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,850
While...

199
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,770
Maybe, guys.

200
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,310
I think it's time that I should make a Roblox game.

201
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:35,650
Guys.

202
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,130
Any dragoons want to develop a Roblox...

203
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,970
Dirty bird game...

204
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,830
With me.

205
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,490
Teach me your ways.

206
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,190
A Roblox goon.

207
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:49,650
Yeah.

208
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,650
The money stays in the system.

209
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,650
Anyway.

210
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,290
Anyway.

211
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,970
It's me.

212
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,050
I'm spending money.

213
00:09:59,310 --> 00:09:59,610
It's me.

214
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,630
I'm the one that that dragoon's milking off of.

215
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,550
Anyway.

216
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,690
Another little thing I want to talk about...

217
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,830
Is that...

218
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:09,770
Um...

219
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,170
Um...

220
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,950
Did you guys know that Last of Us Season 2 is out already?

221
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,050
I heard, like...

222
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,930
Nothing about it at all.

223
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,190
Like, on social media.

224
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,330
Which was crazy.

225
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:18,850
Because, like...

226
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,030
You know.

227
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,890
I feel like...

228
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,050
It'd be a bigger thing.

229
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,410
Since Last of Us Season 1 was...

230
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:23,830
Um...

231
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,510
Did so well.

232
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,190
And...

233
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,070
I was like...

234
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,330
I didn't hear anything about the second season.

235
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,010
Until, like...

236
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,410
One of my friends was telling me.

237
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,790
They're like...

238
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,970
Yeah, I'm watching the...

239
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,630
Season 2 of Last of Us now.

240
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,110
And I was like...

241
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,330
What?

242
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,170
It's out already?

243
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,230
I was like...

244
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,710
So confused.

245
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,710
Because I like...

246
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,070
Didn't...

247
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,810
Oh, so this...

248
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,470
This game is distracting me right now.

249
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,910
So I'm just gonna...

250
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,310
I'm gonna mute this.

251
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,490
Um...

252
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:44,870
But anyway.

253
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,330
So I was like...

254
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:46,470
What?

255
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,410
It's out already?

256
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,730
And then, like...

257
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:48,950
I...

258
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,650
You know...

259
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,150
Um...

260
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,550
I didn't hear anything about it.

261
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,430
But it's been...

262
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,790
It's been around for like...

263
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,550
It's been like...

264
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,030
Out for at least a month now.

265
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,750
And...

266
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:56,910
Okay.

267
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,530
Spoiler.

268
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,690
If you guys didn't realize...

269
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,310
Why everyone hated the second game.

270
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,190
Um...

271
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,130
Here's a big spoiler.

272
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,350
It's because they killed Joel...

273
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,330
Off...

274
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:05,610
Instantly.

275
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,550
And then, obviously...

276
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,830
That's gonna hap...

277
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,250
That hap...

278
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,750
That was gonna happen in...

279
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,470
Season 2.

280
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,370
Because it's based off of the second game.

281
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,210
Um...

282
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,270
So, like...

283
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,370
I got to like...

284
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,350
The second episode.

285
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,690
Like, I watched it.

286
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,570
Because I was like...

287
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:20,930
Curious.

288
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,410
Because my friends were telling me...

289
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,510
Like, yeah, season 2 is out.

290
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,650
And then...

291
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,150
Um...

292
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,810
It was like...

293
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,070
One of the biggest...

294
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,250
Dumb thing that they did.

295
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:29,770
Um...

296
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,270
And...

297
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,530
I was like...

298
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,250
I was like...

299
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,230
I was so sad.

300
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,190
Because I really like Pedro Pascal.

301
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,290
So, they do it instantly, too.

302
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,390
So, I was so... I was so sad because I was like... No!

303
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,110
He's dead!

304
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,090
And then my... I can't believe him!

305
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,610
Why would you kill Pedro Pascal?!

306
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,850
No!

307
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,350
He's so hot!

308
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,030
And then... And I was telling my friend about it.

309
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,990
I was like, why?!

310
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,070
And then my friend was like, you know... You know, like, he's in... You'll find him in the Mandalorian, right?

311
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,310
He's, like, everywhere.

312
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,830
It's not like he's gone forever.

313
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,490
I was like, it's not the same!

314
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,850
He wears a helmet in Mandalorian!

315
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,650
It's not the same!

316
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,090
It's not... I wanna see his face!

317
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,570
It's not fair!

318
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,610
It's not fair!

319
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,910
I thought you liked how it's... Yeah!

320
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,130
But, like, Pedro Pascal, though!

321
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,310
But, like, it's not the same!

322
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,070
There's something about, like, Joel Pedro Pascal that, like...

323
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,650
That, like, hits different!

324
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,350
I'm really sad!

325
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,910
Because I was like, no!

326
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,510
Why couldn't you kill him off in, like, episode 5?

327
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,430
I guess!

328
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,430
Why?

329
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,710
He'll be... Not the same!

330
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,390
He's wearing something... He's wearing, like, dorky outfits in Fantastic Four!

331
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,150
He's a fucking nerd in Fantastic Four, guys!

332
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,310
He's Reed Richards!

333
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,830
It's not the same!

334
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,870
I need, like, the Joel version of Pedro Pascal!

335
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,870
Um... Um...

336
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:43,870
Um...

337
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,990
Um... Defective, thank you for the super chat!

338
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,910
Thank you, thank you!

339
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,170
Thanks for coming out to Fatima!

340
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,290
It was a lot of fun playing trivia!

341
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,750
Can I get you that $90 as your lifeline in the end?

342
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,570
The liar!

343
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,690
Thank you for the super chat!

344
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,630
Thank you, thank you!

345
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,890
Yeah, I want rugged Reed Richards!

346
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,310
I don't want, like, nerdy scientist Reed Richards!

347
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:02,850
I...

348
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,190
Anyway... Um... Anyway...

349
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,410
I don't know if I'll keep watching Last of Us Season 2 at the moment.

350
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:13,990
I don't know!

351
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,150
I don't know how I feel about it!

352
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,970
I did enjoy, um... The first one.

353
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,950
I just didn't quite... I don't know.

354
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,650
The first two episodes, it's like... It was just alright.

355
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,770
It was alright.

356
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,230
Um... Um... Lali, thank you for the super chat!

357
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,930
Thank you!

358
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,530
So MNK code, it physically hurts her to use a code!

359
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:29,730
No!

360
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,710
The reason why!

361
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,910
But, like, um...

362
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,870
I'm not gonna be playing MNK anymore on... on Elden Ring.

363
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,510
It's because I actually... my wrists start... started getting really sore.

364
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,230
Because when I'm, like, moving... I don't know why...

365
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,350
Because I'm using my wrists too much...

366
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,330
in Elden Ring.

367
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,570
So, like, right after I did the stream for Elden Ring...

368
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,270
my wrists actually got really sore.

369
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,390
So, like, I had to use controller.

370
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,150
But then, like, today, when I was practicing...

371
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,270
Sorry.

372
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,010
When I was doing what I was doing...

373
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,460
Doing what I was doing today...

374
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,040
My hands got, like, sore from holding it.

375
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,800
From holding the controller.

376
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,800
Look, we all might know what it is, but, like...

377
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,460
It's all hypothetical and assumptions, guys.

378
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,200
It's all assumptions.

379
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,180
Rogue, thank you for the super chat.

380
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,620
Thank you.

381
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,360
Thank you.

382
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,180
The Last of Us series is a one time where...

383
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,120
a video game, a television, where it would have been justified to deviate from source material.

384
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,040
Joe got the...

385
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,600
HE DIDN'T!

386
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,700
I was like...

387
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:45,860
NOOOOO!

388
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,800
What?

389
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,020
What's the fucking point?

390
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,860
Thank you for the super chat.

391
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Thank you.

392
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,680
Thank you.

393
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,320
Okay, also, like...

394
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,500
You know that Asian guy, um...

395
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,760
That's in The Last of Us?

396
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,060
I forgot his name already.

397
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,060
Like, Devin?

398
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,240
I don't fucking know.

399
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't remember his name.

400
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,660
Evan?

401
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,400
I don't know.

402
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,620
I might not even say...

403
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,820
I don't even know if that's his name.

404
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,320
I might be making it up.

405
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,380
But, Jesse?

406
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,060
Is it...

407
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,680
I don't know.

408
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,700
Did I get all...

409
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,660
That got his names wrong?

410
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:16,900
Oh, no.

411
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,780
Devin's the...

412
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,760
The other...

413
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,640
That's the other women.

414
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,840
The Asian guy.

415
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,720
Um...

416
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,480
The only thing I know about that guy is that...

417
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,520
Apparently...

418
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,020
He had an insane League of Legends addiction.

419
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,800
Um...

420
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,120
Because, like...

421
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,820
I was watching his interview...

422
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,880
One of his interviews...

423
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,100
And he was saying that he used to...

424
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,420
He was, like, a gamer back then.

425
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,880
And he had a crippling addiction to League of Legends.

426
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,660
And then he had to, like...

427
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,080
He had to full on...

428
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
When he started getting bigger...

429
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,400
Became, like...

430
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,500
Got his big break...

431
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,660
He had to delete his League of Legends account.

432
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,800
And he was saying, like...

433
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,540
I spent thousands of dollars on that League account...

434
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,420
With so many skins and everything.

435
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,340
And I had to delete that account.

436
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,380
To pursue acting.

437
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,820
I was like, holy fuck, that is commitment.

438
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,220
They're like, well, why didn't you just, you know, change your password?

439
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,340
And he's like, you don't understand.

440
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
It was really bad.

441
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,920
It was... Like, no, you don't understand.

442
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,760
It was really, really bad.

443
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,240
Like, deleting the account was the only way out.

444
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:26,320
It was... And like, but yeah, like, when he got his big break, he literally was like, I can't, I can't, this will ruin it.

445
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,600
If I keep playing League, like, return to being human.

446
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,460
And he had, like, thousands of dollars of League skins, too.

447
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,980
Like, he was like, yeah, thousands of dollars of League skins.

448
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,200
And some were, like, super rare.

449
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
I can't get them anymore.

450
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,840
And, but then, like, it's all gone now.

451
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,320
It's all gone now.

452
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,060
Like, he had to destroy the curse with his own hand.

453
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,860
Literally, for the sake of his career.

454
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
Um, Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

455
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:57,960
Thank you.

456
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,600
Thank you.

457
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,580
Use your phone for Rod Again Award.

458
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,520
Thank you for the super chat.

459
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,940
Thank you.

460
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,660
Thank you.

461
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,620
Um, so yeah, I thought that was really interesting.

462
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Um, but that's, that's basically it.

463
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,140
The life update and dad update.

464
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,620
Alright, Super Mario mod!

465
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
I wanted to play long today.

466
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,760
But like I said, I gotta do more stuff with Zen and Larmu later.

467
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,840
Because, okay, um, you guys, okay, I'm just gonna say.

468
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,940
If you guys didn't see, like, the teams for the event.

469
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,580
It's, like, pretty, like, like, we know we're not gonna, like, win anything.

470
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,480
But, like, we just want to make sure we know what we're doing.

471
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,180
Like, we just, we just, we just want to know what we're doing.

472
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,980
So, like, so, like, you know, like, at least we progress.

473
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
Like, like,

474
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,760
Tokyo time!

475
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,820
Alright, let me... Alright, here we go.

476
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,360
Where was I?

477
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Oh, I was on Donkey Kong then.

478
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,660
Space, thank you for the super chat.

479
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,420
Thank you, thank you.

480
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,640
I'll talk more about the details tomorrow on stream.

481
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,320
Thanks for doing the meet and greet for Fanime Sunday.

482
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,880
After the Saturn got cancelled, everyone in line was stoked and it was fun to talk to you about the Simpsons hit and run aftermath.

483
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,860
Thank you for the super chat.

484
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,700
Thank you, thank you.

485
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,160
Stuff Shark, thank you for the magenta stupa.

486
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,320
Thank you, thank you.

487
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,220
Hey, Doki, today's my birthday.

488
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,060
Can I get a happy birthday?

489
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,080
Of course you can!

490
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,980
Thank you, my magenta stupa.

491
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,720
Thank you, thank you.

492
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,260
Happy birthday to you.

493
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,940
Happy birthday to you.

494
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,940
Happy birthday, dear Stuff Shark.

495
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,340
Happy birthday to you.

496
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:36,860
Yeah!

497
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,080
Oh my god, I'll tell you guys about what happened at Fanime.

498
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,800
So, like, I talked to 40 plus dragoons on day one of Fanime.

499
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
And so, like, that was, like, I even went overtime.

500
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:56,140
So, like, I almost got to, like, two- I got to, like, almost three hours of just pure meet and greets.

501
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:14,780
So, obviously, apparently, right after, um, I saw on Twitter, people were saying that, like, there was actually, like, um, group- group B and- group 2 and group 3 that were turned away.

502
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:22,920
Anyway, um, yeah, like, most I've ever talked to was 30, um, because it's usually, like, two minutes, uh, per person for, like, an hour.

503
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,980
Like, two minute slots for an hour.

504
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,040
So, usually, I would do maximum 30, because even 30 is a lot for me, um, for, like, one session.

505
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,520
Um, so, the fact that I had two sets, like, I had, like, you know, day one and day two with meet and greets.

506
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,860
Um, so, I didn't realize that.

507
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:46,460
And then, um, right at- like, right after, you know, like, when I was on Twitter, I saw a lot of people were saying on Twitter, they're like, oh, yeah, I got turned away, we lined up and everything.

508
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,200
And I was like, what?

509
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,480
And then I told- asked my, uh, staff, I was like, what's going on?

510
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,120
And my- even my staff didn't know what's going on, because, like, I had one event staff that was at location, at the convention.

511
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,800
Um, and she was saying like, no, it's so differently.

512
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,420
They were saying that there's like all three groups went through.

513
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,000
So, um, so apparently what happened was that, um, it wasn't just me.

514
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,520
Um, but like they treated it like an autograph session.

515
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,620
Where you know how they're like, they autograph and then it's just an autograph and a photo.

516
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,180
And maybe like talk for like 10 to 15 seconds and then next person.

517
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,460
So they treated it like an autograph session where it happens like super duper fast.

518
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,640
But like that's different from a V2 or meet and greet.

519
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,500
Cause like, it wasn't just me, but apparently people were getting turned away for like other sessions as well.

520
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,500
Like other, um, meeting, like other autograph sessions.

521
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,520
So they did that.

522
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,100
Um, because they expect cancellations and stuff.

523
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,560
So they expect people to not show up because it's free.

524
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:53,520
Um, so they, since I was like their first VTuber guest, um, they didn't really know how the system worked for VTubers and like how, um, how like, you know, everybody will show up.

525
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:05,880
Like, they don't know that everybody will show up and then like, you know, and yeah, cause it was a free meet and greet.

526
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,440
Um, you just needed to have like, it was a lottery though.

527
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:17,740
Cause so people just had to, um, uh, uh, people were had to, had to like, you know, just had to sign up for the lottery.

528
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:35,540
So they picked like a hundred and, I think it was like, for the first session, they picked a hundred and, I think like 40 dragoons from the first session alone.

529
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,160
Um, and I wasn't aware of that.

530
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,580
And then like, um, and obviously all, like majority of people showed up because it's like, whoa.

531
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,460
Cause it was like three groups.

532
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,740
And so like, I heard about what happened and I heard that you guys lined up.

533
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,140
So like my staff and like family staff got together to be like, what the fuck happened?

534
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,500
You know?

535
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,180
And obviously they, now they know what to do.

536
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,500
Um, now they know like what to do.

537
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,560
So they, for the next VTuber guests, they won't overbook them stuff.

538
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,440
But to make up for it, I did two extra sessions.

539
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,540
Um, I did two extra sessions on Sunday, uh, for the meet and greet.

540
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,640
Um, so I had basically a nine to five on Sunday.

541
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,140
Cause I started my day at 10 a.m.

542
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,840
And then I ended my day at 5 p.m.

543
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,440
I...

544
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,820
Because, um, I had a meet and greet.

545
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,380
I did an artist alley.

546
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,660
And then I did an artist alley.

547
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:53,520
And then, um, um, and, um, and then right after the artist alley meeting the artist there, I went to my meet and greet, and there was supposed to be like one meet and greet.

548
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,220
And then, and then a panel.

549
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,880
And then I'm done.

550
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,420
But then I did the meet and greet, and then I did the panel.

551
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,420
And then I did the second session of meet and greet to meet everyone on Sunday.

552
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
That got cancelled on Saturday.

553
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,500
Unfortunately, that meant the people that applied for Sunday might not have been able to meet me.

554
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,260
Because at that point, I met 120 dragoons.

555
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,020
I met 120 dragoons in the span of two days.

556
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,700
And that's like my record.

557
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,000
Because I have never gone above 40 before.

558
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:29,300
I've never... So, I'm sorry I couldn't do more for Sunday.

559
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,220
Because at that point, I was so tired.

560
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,740
I was so tired at the end.

561
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,100
Yeah, I like tripled my record there.

562
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,680
But I do hope... I do hope everybody had a good time at Fanimate.

563
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,220
I had a great time meeting everybody.

564
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,920
I do love meeting my dragoons.

565
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,780
And I'm really sorry that happened at Fanimate.

566
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,640
But now, like, you know, they know what to do for VTuber meet and greets.

567
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,380
Like, you know, I'm the first one.

568
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,960
There had to be, like, mistakes going in.

569
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
It was all a learning experience for them.

570
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,460
And so, like, I hope that, like, lets them know what not to do next time when they get their next VTuber guest.

571
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:20,860
And I was just, like, you know, a learning experience for them to, like, improve how VTuber stuff is done and things.

572
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,760
But there were so many dragoons!

573
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,480
It was crazy.

574
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,520
It always makes me so happy to see so many dragoons show up during these conventions.

575
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,960
Aphelion, thank you for the five gift of ships.

576
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,860
Thank you, thank you.

577
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,340
Space, thank you for the super chat.

578
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,100
Thank you, thank you.

579
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,160
The League icon speaks to me like the Green Goblin mask.

580
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,280
It's like they laced it with black magic or something.

581
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,200
JL, thank you for the super chat.

582
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:43,920
Thank you, thank you.

583
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,400
They underestimated dedication of the dragoons.

584
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,220
Thank you for the super chat.

585
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,040
Thank you, thank you.

586
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

587
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,240
Thank you, thank you.

588
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,260
You need to treat dragoons better.

589
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,360
They are too starved for...

590
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,320
What do you mean?

591
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,900
My dragoons are so overweight for the amount I feed them!

592
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,140
You are just like that.

593
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,200
Even when I feed them, even when I feed him, he's out there trying to have more.

594
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,220
He's like, I'm so hungry.

595
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,880
We're not all chunky.

596
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,540
Guys, that's it.

597
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,460
I'm removing it.

598
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:34,940
That's it.

599
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,820
You say I need to treat dragoons better?

600
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,920
That's it.

601
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm taking down the last cup of coffee waiting room.

602
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm taking it down.

603
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,700
Until you appreciate me.

604
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,840
What?

605
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,560
No!

606
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,520
Please!

607
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,840
That's right!

608
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
That's right!

609
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm gonna... I'll do it!

610
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,140
You know I will.

611
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,420
You know I will.

612
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,640
Take those dragoons down instead.

613
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,900
Puls, what have you done?

614
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,800
That's right.

615
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,300
Appreciate me right now.

616
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,240
I... I got those videos and I instantly uploaded them.

617
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,920
Richard, welcome to the tomato farm.

618
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,300
Welcome, welcome.

619
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,840
He's trying...

620
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,060
Oh!

621
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,340
You think I'm trying to scare you?

622
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:34,960
All right.

623
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,940
Look at that video right now and I'm gonna private it.

624
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,340
You want to play with me?

625
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,800
You want to play with me?

626
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
You want to try and...

627
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
She's gonna do it.

628
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,460
Powerball, thank you for the super chat.

629
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:54,820
Thank you.

630
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,360
Thank you.

631
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,840
Happy to see you.

632
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,380
I'm being great.

633
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,180
It's almost a year since last time I met you at AFCON Anime Expo.

634
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,500
Thank you for the super chat, Powerball.

635
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:01,880
Thank you.

636
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,740
Thank you.

637
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,720
No worries.

638
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,120
It was great meeting you, too.

639
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,720
Oh my god.

640
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,400
You were like the last person on day one, too.

641
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,040
I don't... Oh my god.

642
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,520
It was great talking to you.

643
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,860
Manny, thank you for the super chat.

644
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,300
Thank you.

645
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,940
Thank you.

646
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,260
Doki is a kind and generous VTuber.

647
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,740
She loves us and does so much.

648
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,480
Dragoons, please stop angering her.

649
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,020
Thank you for the super chat.

650
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,660
Thank you.

651
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,440
Thank you.

652
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,540
Lord Corozos, thank you for the super chat.

653
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:28,960
Thank you.

654
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,520
Thank you.

655
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,560
Words cannot express their gratitude.

656
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,760
You are the most gracious of the leaders.

657
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,080
Oh, thank you, guys.

658
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,680
Thank you.

659
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,280
All right, guys.

660
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,300
Now I'm satisfied.

661
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,280
Now...

662
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,880
You have... It's like...

663
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,800
You know, it's like those, like, angry gods that you have to make a sacrifice in a volcano.

664
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,940
And you have to send... You have to sacrifice, like, a virgin or something into a volcano.

665
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,980
And then, like, the gods have now been satisfied.

666
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,940
That's me.

667
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
That's me right now.

668
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,320
All right.

669
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,000
The VOD lives on another day.

670
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,200
Don't worry.

671
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,800
I shall not...

672
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,880
The VOD lives on another day.

673
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,920
We saved... You guys saved the music video.

674
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,820
That man with power now.

675
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,760
All right.

676
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:25,980
All right.

677
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,340
I don't remember...

678
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,540
I don't really remember...

679
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:29,780
Oh, yeah.

680
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,380
I remember now.

681
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,360
I think I talked to everybody here, right?

682
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,640
Oh, yeah.

683
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,040
That's where the cookie was.

684
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,520
I volunteered as a tribute.

685
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh, Ninja.

686
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,500
Thank you for the super chat.

687
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:38,900
Thank you.

688
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,600
Thank you.

689
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,860
Hey, Doki.

690
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
You can sing happy birthday to the stuff shark?

691
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,140
Of course I can.

692
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,020
Thank you for the super chat.

693
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,280
Thank you.

694
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,760
Thank you.

695
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,480
Happy birthday to you.

696
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,120
Happy birthday to you.

697
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,100
Happy birthday, dear stuff shark.

698
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,460
Happy birthday to you.

699
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah.

700
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,820
Happy birthday.

701
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,000
Pasebo bunny.

702
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,980
Thank you for the super chat.

703
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,300
Thank you.

704
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,940
Thank you.

705
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,840
I show up, and the first thing I hear is the wonderful Doki threatening us.

706
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
What did you do, Dragoons?

707
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,280
Exactly, Dragoons.

708
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,840
What did you do?

709
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,320
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

710
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,380
They, like, fucking launched him out there.

711
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,100
Oh, oh, wait, I got healed.

712
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,360
Well, that was weird.

713
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,900
Was that your toe friend that just got shot out of the cannon?

714
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,960
If you like, I think I'm advice on how you can help him out.

715
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,860
What did I do?

716
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,520
You will just blast out whenever you want, be it supplies or even coins.

717
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,380
You should give it a shot to help your friends out.

718
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,200
No, that's fine.

719
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,940
Wait, is stream lagging for you guys?

720
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,280
Is it YouTube?

721
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,740
Um, is it YouTube?

722
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,860
I did, like, adjust some stuff.

723
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,420
Let me look at my output.

724
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,420
No, it's not the right.

725
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,500
Is that the usual?

726
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,600
Uh, Doki required appreciation and YouTube started dying.

727
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,200
It can... it can't handle it.

728
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,560
Thank you for the super chat.

729
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,980
Thank you, thank you, Duck.

730
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,640
Um, but yeah, is it just my...

731
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,320
Is it just me or is it just you?

732
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,020
Is it just YouTube?

733
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,500
Okay.

734
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,040
Sometimes YouTube is weird.

735
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,040
So, like, I couldn't...

736
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,480
I don't know.

737
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,500
If it's just YouTube, then I'll just...

738
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,300
We'll just...

739
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,860
We can wait a little bit.

740
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
It's okay on my end?

741
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,800
Yeah.

742
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,040
Oh, YouTube is having issues.

743
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,600
Is any other channels having issues or is it just me?

744
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,660
Oh, it's happening to both streams?

745
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,020
Ah!

746
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,320
It's always a YouTube.

747
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,700
I think it's just bandwidth stuff.

748
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
YouTube is always bugging out in general.

749
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,740
Did I get everything here?

750
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,720
5-2 is supposed to be a place of history and nature.

751
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,300
I swear, we can't have nice things with a Koopa Troopa around.

752
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,460
Can I just go for it?

753
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,420
Well, too bad.

754
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,040
You can't fight us with a teammate.

755
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,660
It's against the rules.

756
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,000
Now, scram.

757
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,160
All right.

758
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,100
God damn it.

759
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,840
I have to use Toad.

760
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,140
Okay.

761
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,080
I found the TM.

762
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,260
All right.

763
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,540
Nice.

764
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,420
You gotta try Mega Man Legends.

765
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,800
Audio, thank you for the Super Chat.

766
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,160
Thank you.

767
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,540
Thank you.

768
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,960
I'd like to go back to Mega Man.

769
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,740
Just one day.

770
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,700
Better not leave without Mario.

771
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,480
I better not leave without Mario!

772
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,580
Oh, it's here.

773
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,780
Oh.

774
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,320
Ah.

775
00:31:59,640 --> 00:31:59,820
E.

776
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,480
Hey, you.

777
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,700
Let's have a battle.

778
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,320
All right.

779
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,300
It's time to fight him.

780
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,620
Most likely, I'm gonna try and finish...

781
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,500
I was gonna say Donkey Kong.

782
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,220
Most likely, I was trying to finish Donkey Kong 1.

783
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,100
And then...

784
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,420
After...

785
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,360
After...

786
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,820
Donkey Kong...

787
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,460
I'm gonna stop at after finishing Donkey Kong World.

788
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,180
Just so I can have time for it later tonight.

789
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,260
So I don't get too tired.

790
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,080
Zekra, thank you for the Super Chat.

791
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,400
Thank you.

792
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,140
Thank you.

793
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,120
I'm very grateful for being dragged out of that seamlessly endless health.

794
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,860
Which was when...

795
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,560
When it's in my turn for the meeting.

796
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,260
I cannot thank you enough for doing it.

797
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,080
All you can for us.

798
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,220
I have many more Dragoons.

799
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,000
I hope many more Dragoons get the opportunity.

800
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,020
I hope so, too.

801
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,080
It was...

802
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,060
I always love doing these meet and greets.

803
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,740
And just, like, you know...

804
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,980
Getting to meet everybody.

805
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,180
It's always a great time.

806
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,040
Thank you for the Super Chat.

807
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,260
Thank you.

808
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,660
That's why I do so many...

809
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,860
Oh my god.

810
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,820
They both use Protect.

811
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
That's why I do, like...

812
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,980
So many conventions.

813
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Because, you know...

814
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,460
It's such a unique experience to meet Dragoons.

815
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,100
And it's always such a...

816
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,480
It's such a...

817
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,380
Like...

818
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,860
For some people, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

819
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,040
So, like...

820
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,720
I always love doing the meet and greets.

821
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,520
Okay, we'll try to drop that guy.

822
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,840
I don't know if I can pick him up.

823
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
He's a pretty big man.

824
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,400
Big rock guy.

825
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,180
Okay, yeah.

826
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,260
Oh, I caught it!

827
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,620
Oh, not big enough!

828
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,460
Not...

829
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,640
That's right!

830
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,000
Not big enough!

831
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,860
Alright, get out of here.

832
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,660
Alright.

833
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,500
Nice.

834
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,740
Hammer, bro.

835
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,880
Alright, goodbye.

836
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,660
Oh, okay.

837
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,620
That doesn't matter.

838
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,280
It did nothing.

839
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,040
It did nothing.

840
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,040
Alright.

841
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
Use our boomerang.

842
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,900
And then...

843
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,940
I don't know what to use.

844
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,780
I guess, like, payback?

845
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,400
Okay.

846
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,960
That's awkward.

847
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,140
It's awkward.

848
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay.

849
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:10,840
Okay.

850
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,460
Oh, no, guys.

851
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,700
I guess ice?

852
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,340
Maybe ice will work.

853
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't know.

854
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:25,640
I don't know.

855
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,430
Kogashi, thank you for the super chat.

856
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:31,830
Thank you.

857
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,610
Thank you.

858
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,730
What's nice meeting you at Fandime?

859
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,830
I was the dude that asked the Three Kingdoms question.

860
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,910
Was it a fun highlight on the weekend?

861
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,750
Thank you for the super chat.

862
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,050
Thank you.

863
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,630
Thank you.

864
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:39,930
I'm glad.

865
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,230
I had a great time.

866
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,750
Mavis, thank you for the super chat.

867
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,070
Thank you.

868
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,570
Thank you.

869
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,690
Yes, please.

870
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,850
Mega Man Legends.

871
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,150
Only you can help us get him off the moon.

872
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:49,750
Please.

873
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:50,890
Okay.

874
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,730
I now have ice.

875
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,410
I'm just using payback.

876
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,070
Oh, okay.

877
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,370
There we go.

878
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:56,830
That works.

879
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,530
Oh, nice.

880
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,650
I should have used ice in the beginning.

881
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,270
I still don't remember...

882
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,090
I still don't remember my type advantages.

883
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,630
Yay!

884
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,250
It sucks, though.

885
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,010
I don't like...

886
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,690
I don't like this gimmick.

887
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,190
Because I fucking hate Captain Toad.

888
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,850
What is he doing here?

889
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,410
Make sure you have enough party when attacking.

890
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,030
Don't get caught off guard.

891
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,350
So make sure you have enough...

892
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,290
Wait, where am I supposed to take this rock?

893
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,710
Oh, here?

894
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,470
Is that a button?

895
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,490
I can't tell.

896
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:42,930
Alright.

897
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,410
Oh, okay, what did I do?

898
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,670
Yeah, but we got to put up with it.

899
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,590
Where's Bowser's orders and all?

900
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,010
Do you hear something?

901
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,870
I think it's coming from above us.

902
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,110
Oh no, Mario!

903
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,950
Wait, what about me?

904
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,510
Am I... Oh, I'm okay.

905
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,190
I was going to be like, oh my god, it's coming towards me!

906
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,030
Mario, look out!

907
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,970
I'm going to get isekai'd.

908
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,950
K-k-k, you don't want to take this ladder, do you?

909
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:26,110
Well, you have to get past me and let me warn you, I fight in a very tricky way.

910
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,510
You killed him.

911
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,990
K-k-k, you asked for it.

912
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:30,990
What?

913
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,890
I was going to be like, Mario, no!

914
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,890
He has his airpods on!

915
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,430
He can't hear it!

916
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:42,910
Alright.

917
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,430
Unnerved.

918
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,890
It's too... Okay, let's see.

919
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,890
I don't even remember any... I don't remember my moves.

920
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,330
It's been too long.

921
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,630
Wait, I have all fighting?

922
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,730
Okay, no, there's this fire.

923
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,310
I was going to be like, oh, that's awkward.

924
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,170
If everything is fighting.

925
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,470
Okay.

926
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,130
Wait, actually, what was it?

927
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,630
Is it heat crush?

928
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,670
Where is my weight?

929
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,110
Where is dad's weight?

930
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,030
Alright, dad.

931
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:10,990
My big boy.

932
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,610
That's right!

933
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,110
My big boy!

934
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,390
Time to crush him!

935
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,250
Okay, that's not it.

936
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,190
No retreat.

937
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,750
Come on, crush him!

938
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,330
That's right!

939
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,610
Sit on him!

940
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:40,970
I don't understand why... You guys ever heard that thing where it's a kink for...

941
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,210
Where people pay, like, hot women to sit on cakes?

942
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,590
I don't understand that.

943
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:53,470
Does anyone have... Does anyone want to, like, tell me why?

944
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,670
Yeah!

945
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,410
Have you guys heard about that?

946
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:57,930
Kink?

947
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,590
They pay, like, women to, like, sit on cakes.

948
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,910
And then, like, yeah, like, you... Is your... I don't know where I found out about that.

949
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,350
I... It's called... Wait, it's called cake fight!

950
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,190
What?

951
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,690
I failed.

952
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,310
Wait, what was the tricky thing?

953
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,450
K-k-k-k-k?

954
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,250
I gotta get out of here!

955
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,650
Wait, you said it'd be, like, really tricky.

956
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,910
What was the tricky part?

957
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,630
Um...

958
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,650
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

959
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,030
Oh, don't... A trunkle?

960
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,190
I don't have a trunkle.

961
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,010
I also forgot to fix my third monitor.

962
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,230
I know I was supposed to, but...

963
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,270
I forgot.

964
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,010
I forgot about it.

965
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,370
Okay, but how does he... Okay, whoever explained to me about, you know...

966
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,550
Wants to be a trunk... Okay, the guy that told me about...

967
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,470
Cake fart.

968
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,530
I'm trying to... I'm trying to find you right now.

969
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,150
Alright.

970
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,140
Oh, it was D-Dragon?!

971
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,560
No, oh wait, Gordon!

972
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,180
Alright, Gordon, you also knew.

973
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,180
Wait, I know about this.

974
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,020
It's Cap.

975
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,900
A large rock that becomes a grass type somehow.

976
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,560
When a piece of it breaks off, it gets its own mind.

977
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,740
But the Cap committee banned this power.

978
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,040
Alright, you get to be a trunkle.

979
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,600
Yeah, you look like a guy that enjoyed sitting on cakes.

980
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,020
Yeah.

981
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,360
Yeah, that looks like a tree that...

982
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,820
That wants to sit on a cake right now.

983
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,880
Wait.

984
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,920
Gordon.

985
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,460
Gordon.

986
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,080
Goon.

987
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,730
Oh wait.

988
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,270
Uh...

989
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,910
B-b-b-b-b-b.

990
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,450
There we go.

991
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,790
That's what...

992
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,910
Wait.

993
00:39:59,410 --> 00:39:59,770
Defecto.

994
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,950
Thank you for the super chat.

995
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,450
Thank you.

996
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,250
Thank you.

997
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,870
Uh...

998
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,450
Papa Smurf.

999
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,330
Thank you for the super chat.

1000
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,910
Thank you.

1001
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,470
Seeing how you went above and beyond.

1002
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,750
For the group 2 and 3 goons.

1003
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,190
Just prove why you're my Kamioshi.

1004
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,850
Also glad you like your rare fish.

1005
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1006
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:14,990
Thank you, thank you.

1007
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,830
Congrats, Gordon!

1008
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,850
We know what you like.

1009
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,210
Like...

1010
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,150
I know...

1011
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,270
Wait.

1012
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,730
Actually...

1013
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,530
Now that I...

1014
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,110
We know.

1015
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,290
We all know.

1016
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,890
That's why you get to be in the exclusive goon cave.

1017
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,320
Is there a...

1018
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,360
Is there a...

1019
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,080
Is there a...

1020
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,100
Is there a Mario mod that looks like a cake?

1021
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,540
You know what?

1022
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,830
Uh...

1023
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,430
Yeah.

1024
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,550
It's almost like a cake.

1025
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:51,470
Yeah.

1026
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,990
Don't put him.

1027
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,090
When I find another one that looks like a cake...

1028
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,370
I'll...

1029
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,090
I'll replace him.

1030
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,770
Uh...

1031
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,250
Yeah.

1032
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,410
You know, we...

1033
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,910
We got one of the parts in there.

1034
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:10,750
Uh...

1035
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,390
Cafe Clone.

1036
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1037
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,030
Thank you.

1038
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,230
Again, for Fanny being able to dress as two Doughkeeper outfits...

1039
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,570
And interacting with fellow Dracos was such a blast!

1040
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,390
Uh...

1041
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,710
Fuzzy, thank you for the super chat.

1042
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,690
Thank you, thank you.

1043
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,350
Boo!

1044
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,310
Gotcha!

1045
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,330
Nutmeg.

1046
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,190
What's a nutmeg?

1047
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,140
Oh, that's his name!

1048
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,140
Oh my god!

1049
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,760
You haven't!

1050
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,980
I can't believe you...

1051
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,680
You named...

1052
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,580
How dare you!

1053
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,600
You're just a minion!

1054
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,440
Who named...

1055
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,180
Who gave you...

1056
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,840
Who gave you the...

1057
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,260
Uh...

1058
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,800
Audacity to name yourself?

1059
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,120
Who gave you the right...

1060
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,620
Alright.

1061
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,280
Rock for that fucker.

1062
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,300
He did not protect.

1063
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,540
Wait, what?

1064
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,300
That's it?

1065
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:55,920
Okay.

1066
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,240
Oh, I used the wrong one.

1067
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,280
He was supposed to sit on him.

1068
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,680
God dammit!

1069
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,140
No!

1070
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,600
My money!

1071
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,520
Did anyone get the license plates on that bird?

1072
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,400
Uh...

1073
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,460
I'll just use that.

1074
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,800
Alright.

1075
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,100
Come on, dad.

1076
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,000
It's time to sit on it.

1077
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,920
Okay, guys.

1078
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,640
Who wants the super chat dad to sit on...

1079
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,340
Who wants the super chat dad to sit on this bird?

1080
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,800
Come on!

1081
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,280
Come on!

1082
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,800
Any tickets?

1083
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,820
Come on!

1084
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,960
Any offers?

1085
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,260
Any offers?

1086
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,220
Toki, please...

1087
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,480
Do not sit on the bird.

1088
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,240
It's too late.

1089
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,240
It's too late.

1090
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,400
He sat on the bird.

1091
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,620
That'll be five dollars.

1092
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:48,760
Alright.

1093
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,020
How...

1094
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,280
Uh...

1095
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,500
Sorry, Toki.

1096
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,400
This is not my kink.

1097
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,820
Daxi, thank you for the super chat.

1098
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,300
Thank you.

1099
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,020
Thank you.

1100
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,080
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

1101
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,400
Thank you.

1102
00:42:59,520 --> 00:42:59,900
Thank you.

1103
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,120
Sit on that bird.

1104
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:01,960
Okay.

1105
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,420
Now, who wants the...

1106
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,560
Who wants the super chat to watch dad sit on the bully?

1107
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,060
It comes with a complimentary kink.

1108
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,260
Sit on that bird, dad.

1109
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,820
Red mage and whoop.

1110
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,060
Thank you for the super chat.

1111
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,440
Thank you.

1112
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,160
Thank you.

1113
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,160
Sit on that bird, dad.

1114
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,400
I paid good money for this.

1115
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,480
Oh my god!

1116
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,500
It's not...

1117
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,980
Guys, who would have thought...

1118
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,680
Something made of metal...

1119
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,480
Who would have thought...

1120
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,280
Something made of metal was not...

1121
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,620
Cannot be squished.

1122
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Oh, man.

1123
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:45,740
That's...

1124
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,540
That's...

1125
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,160
Butters a little squashed now.

1126
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,520
Uh, eating.

1127
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1128
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,560
Thank you.

1129
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,280
Thank you.

1130
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,360
Alright.

1131
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:58,800
Nice.

1132
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,520
Don't do it.

1133
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,860
It has horns.

1134
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,680
My surprise attack wasn't enough?

1135
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,900
I mean...

1136
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,180
I literally talked to you, so it wasn't that surprising.

1137
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,580
I had to talk to you.

1138
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,180
Oh, look.

1139
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,380
There's an ookiki.

1140
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,960
Already got one.

1141
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,060
For these, so we can ignore it.

1142
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,680
Alright.

1143
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,280
Okay, we gotta talk to him.

1144
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,040
Stop!

1145
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,400
This is my item.

1146
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,340
You will not lay your rubby hands on it.

1147
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,860
Alright.

1148
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,640
I'm gonna touch it.

1149
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,880
It's time!

1150
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,140
Say it!

1151
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,240
Tokia!

1152
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,160
Say it!

1153
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,760
I'm gonna sit on that eye.

1154
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,500
Alright!

1155
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,940
In front of a live audience!

1156
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,560
Say it!

1157
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,000
Say the line, Tokia!

1158
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,200
Say it!

1159
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,820
Uh, Tom.

1160
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1161
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,200
Thank you.

1162
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,900
Thank you.

1163
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,860
I'm gonna squish it!

1164
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,720
Uh, yeah.

1165
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,120
It is.

1166
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,880
This game is free.

1167
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,760
Google Super Mario mod.

1168
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,580
Stop!

1169
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,680
Stop!

1170
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:14,840
Toki!

1171
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,240
This is a sitting stream now.

1172
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,360
Alright.

1173
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:24,760
Nice.

1174
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,540
What the fuck?

1175
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,400
He dug a hole?

1176
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,500
That's just a mummy!

1177
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,700
Okay, we gotta...

1178
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,620
Okay, we're gonna...

1179
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,340
Oh, but I can't do anything.

1180
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,140
Okay, I'm just gonna do this for now.

1181
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,220
And I'm gonna swap.

1182
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,500
Did I learn...

1183
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,080
Doki is...

1184
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,720
No, no, no!

1185
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,080
Dad is obsessed with sitting on things.

1186
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,760
That's different.

1187
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:46,860
That's...

1188
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,620
Are you kink-shaming Dad now?

1189
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,180
This is a kink-shame-free zone.

1190
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,160
Alright.

1191
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,860
Oh, it doesn't...

1192
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,420
God damn it.

1193
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,120
I thought I was gonna...

1194
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,280
I thought like...

1195
00:45:59,280 --> 00:45:59,820
Um...

1196
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,260
My...

1197
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,700
Uh...

1198
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,040
I thought Dad was faster.

1199
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,060
Now lick it too.

1200
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:11,720
Okay.

1201
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,240
We're gonna have to wait for him to come back up.

1202
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,800
You're gonna lick it too.

1203
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,380
Oh, it doesn't affect him?

1204
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:19,760
No!

1205
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,400
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

1206
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,600
Thank you, thank you.

1207
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,280
I can't believe it!

1208
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,420
It doesn't affect him!

1209
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,720
To the victor goes the spoils.

1210
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,720
Alright.

1211
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,280
Let's see.

1212
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,420
Oh, safety goggles.

1213
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,840
I wonder what that does.

1214
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,900
Guess I'll never find out.

1215
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,500
I'm gonna have a Fudgy.

1216
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,780
I don't need it.

1217
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:55,660
Schooling.

1218
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,560
Wait, actually...

1219
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,500
I can just level up.

1220
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,540
Right now if I kill it.

1221
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,060
Bye, Fuzzy.

1222
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,140
Goodbye!

1223
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,680
Yay!

1224
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm gonna blow my nose.

1225
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,220
I'm not gonna mute myself for this.

1226
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,280
I'm too tired.

1227
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,020
Alright.

1228
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,340
Yay!

1229
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,040
Level up!

1230
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:21,390
Wait.

1231
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,030
A toad wants to fight me?

1232
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,350
I thought we're on the same side.

1233
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:26,930
Solid Snake.

1234
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:27,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1235
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:28,250
Thank you.

1236
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:28,850
Thank you.

1237
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,490
Toki, please.

1238
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,910
Whenever you bring this stuff, I'm gonna get trauma flashback from when I was a content mod.

1239
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,810
Your imagination gives me nightmares.

1240
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,130
Check out all the rare creatures I found up here!

1241
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,630
I thought you were on my side.

1242
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:42,910
Why are you fighting me?

1243
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,630
Oh, he literally just caught all of these guys.

1244
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:50,810
Okay.

1245
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,290
Alright, that's...

1246
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:52,810
That's neat.

1247
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:54,690
Alright, let's get...

1248
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,170
Oh my god.

1249
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,430
This is the perfect one.

1250
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,790
It's actually...

1251
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,510
Guys, look what happens to Rex.

1252
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,470
Look what happens.

1253
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,810
If he lives.

1254
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,070
If he lives.

1255
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,790
If he lives.

1256
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,050
It could've...

1257
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:24,450
It would...

1258
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,330
Oh, there we go.

1259
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,170
Look at...

1260
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,130
That's right.

1261
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,650
That's right.

1262
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,530
That's right.

1263
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:34,550
No!

1264
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,600
Sat perfect.

1265
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,720
That's what I want my cake to look like.

1266
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,810
Okay, we just need to hope that dad doesn't die.

1267
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:54,910
Yay!

1268
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:58,650
Alright.

1269
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,850
Sick bug grew to level 31.

1270
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:01,590
Oh nice!

1271
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:02,330
He flinched too.

1272
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:03,330
That's what I needed.

1273
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,750
Yeah, I need a...

1274
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,430
Fuck, I only have fighting too.

1275
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,690
That's bad.

1276
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,550
Because like, a bird doesn't care about fighting.

1277
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,830
No more.

1278
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,170
I used it all up, guys.

1279
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:21,410
No more.

1280
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:22,590
No more.

1281
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,750
No more.

1282
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:27,450
My content!

1283
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,990
How would dad make a living now, chat?

1284
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,350
Guys, this was his 9 to 5.

1285
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,710
Now he's gonna be...

1286
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,390
Now he's gonna be homeless.

1287
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,170
He lost all the peepee.

1288
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,230
How would he make a living now, chat?

1289
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,710
What will we do now?

1290
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,290
This was...

1291
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,430
This was his real job.

1292
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,510
This was how he's gonna...

1293
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,050
This was how he paid half of his rent.

1294
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,630
Now I have to kick him out.

1295
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:12,910
Alright.

1296
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,530
We need a...

1297
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,470
Only dad.

1298
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:19,770
Absolutely, thank you for the super chat.

1299
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,990
Thank you, thank you.

1300
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,790
Oh wait, it hit himself.

1301
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:25,390
Nice.

1302
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,510
Alright, and then we'll just headbutt...

1303
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,230
Wiggler.

1304
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,810
Oh my god, he's gonna make himself even angrier.

1305
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,390
Oh my god, he's gonna go beyond...

1306
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,390
Beyond the anger threshold.

1307
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,900
What, you think he lives here for free?

1308
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,780
Why do you think he's been sitting on cake?

1309
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,160
It was definitely not a hobby for him.

1310
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,880
It...

1311
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,560
Alright, we gotta...

1312
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,940
We gotta send...

1313
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,620
We gotta swap Dragoon.

1314
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,820
He might...

1315
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,960
He might be fucked.

1316
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,180
Don't worry.

1317
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,580
Dad's a strong boy.

1318
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,200
Uproot?

1319
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:08,680
Oh, I'm gonna...

1320
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,860
I can smash the...

1321
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,420
Oh, I'm gonna smash the...

1322
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,140
I'm gonna kill the Dragoon with...

1323
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,900
With a...

1324
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,040
Karate chop.

1325
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,220
Friendly fire.

1326
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,440
Okay.

1327
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,240
Oh, never mind.

1328
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,300
I guess not.

1329
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,840
He lives another day.

1330
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,180
Okay.

1331
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,260
Oh wait, the move always hits critical.

1332
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:36,640
I forgot.

1333
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,320
Why me?

1334
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,080
Oh, it's not very effective.

1335
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:42,360
Good.

1336
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,640
Stupid sandstorm.

1337
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,460
Okay, good.

1338
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,240
It hits him too.

1339
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,620
Wait, what?

1340
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,660
What happened to me?

1341
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,020
Why did I...

1342
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,660
Why did I like...

1343
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,160
Swap?

1344
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,540
That's Jala.

1345
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,000
I'm gonna try it.

1346
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,520
Again?

1347
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,180
Again?

1348
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,780
Wait, how many times can he do that?

1349
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,760
God damn it.

1350
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,910
Oh no.

1351
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:20,830
Goodbye.

1352
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,430
Goodbye Husky.

1353
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:23,350
Goodbye.

1354
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,150
Fire upgrades.

1355
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,930
Oh, fire upgrades at low health.

1356
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:31,570
God damn it.

1357
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,550
My only up...

1358
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,590
You can't use it forever.

1359
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,150
I'm gonna kill you.

1360
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,650
You can't hide behind.

1361
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,870
You can't hide behind the doll forever.

1362
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,030
Alright, nice.

1363
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,010
How is it still...

1364
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:54,570
Okay, I was gonna say.

1365
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,730
How is it still like...

1366
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,090
Storming?

1367
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,050
Those wasted crits.

1368
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:02,770
It's okay.

1369
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,270
This move always lands crits.

1370
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,540
So it's not wasted.

1371
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,320
Oh my god.

1372
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,780
That's all he knows how to do.

1373
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,620
He just knows how...

1374
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,400
He just fucking...

1375
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,560
Does a sandstorm.

1376
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:18,820
Alright.

1377
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,200
Yay!

1378
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,560
I hope catching these are doing better than...

1379
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,560
Doesn't violate any protection laws.

1380
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,400
Alright.

1381
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,520
I'll find a place to heal.

1382
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,400
Has to be like...

1383
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,520
Oh my god.

1384
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,500
It's still stuff.

1385
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,700
I wonder like...

1386
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,400
If there's any water mons here.

1387
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,460
Any water ones?

1388
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:41,980
Oh god.

1389
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:42,480
Never mind.

1390
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,680
I just get stick bugged.

1391
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,000
Silly me.

1392
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:45,780
Silly...

1393
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,240
Silly me for thinking...

1394
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,140
I would ever encounter something else.

1395
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,940
I'm so silly.

1396
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,080
I just...

1397
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,140
I'm sitting on this.

1398
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,620
I...

1399
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,280
Oh my god.

1400
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,180
I can't even...

1401
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:00,840
I...

1402
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,580
Oh my god.

1403
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,400
I swear to god.

1404
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,520
Get out of here.

1405
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,700
Silly me for thinking...

1406
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,760
That...

1407
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,780
It'd be something different.

1408
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,840
You just get stick bugged.

1409
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,720
I...

1410
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,920
That's my secret.

1411
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,560
I always get stick bugged.

1412
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,240
I like heal from here.

1413
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,740
Polio party.

1414
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,120
Okay.

1415
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,580
Wait.

1416
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,260
Wait.

1417
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:28,840
Heal me.

1418
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,260
Are you serious?

1419
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,600
Oh!

1420
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,820
Do I have...

1421
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,140
Did I use my one-up on him?

1422
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,200
Was that my one-up?

1423
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,000
There's no way.

1424
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,740
Was that my one-up?

1425
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,700
Or was that the...

1426
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,180
Was that my one-up on him?

1427
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,160
Is it taken out of...

1428
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,240
My bag?

1429
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,040
My one-up!

1430
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:12,700
My one-up!

1431
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,960
I had...

1432
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,920
Stupid...

1433
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,280
Fucking toad!

1434
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,520
Stupid toad!

1435
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,440
Oh my god!

1436
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,260
I found out.

1437
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,040
Okay.

1438
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,840
We gotta heal dad.

1439
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,520
Guys.

1440
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,040
We gotta heal him.

1441
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,700
He's not doing okay.

1442
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:46,740
Guys.

1443
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,960
We gotta heal him.

1444
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,600
Okay.

1445
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,420
I still have...

1446
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,720
I still have this.

1447
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,700
Alright.

1448
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,900
You are gonna...

1449
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,590
You'll play a big part...

1450
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,160
In this world.

1451
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,000
I know I have.

1452
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,800
I know I have.

1453
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,240
Oh no.

1454
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,580
Oh.

1455
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,000
Oh.

1456
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,840
I have a stroom.

1457
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,120
Alright.

1458
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,560
Goodbye, Hefli.

1459
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,200
Thank you for your service.

1460
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:18,580
I use...

1461
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,040
I healed the wrong one.

1462
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:20,700
I...

1463
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,280
I don't know.

1464
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,420
Okay, Hefli.

1465
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,580
I guess...

1466
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:35,980
Thank...

1467
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,020
God, thank dad for your service.

1468
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:41,660
Okay.

1469
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,400
Attack that steals.

1470
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,000
Alright.

1471
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:45,920
Let's see.

1472
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,020
Water...

1473
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,160
Let's just get rid of water gun.

1474
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,140
I thought...

1475
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,800
I thought I gave it to dad.

1476
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,640
Alright.

1477
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,360
Nevermind.

1478
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,140
Welcome back.

1479
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,980
Welcome back, Hefli.

1480
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,600
Alright.

1481
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,020
Surely I live here, right?

1482
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,280
Okay, I believe.

1483
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,740
I'm gonna slash sumo bro.

1484
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,740
That should be super effective.

1485
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,620
Because it's a fighting.

1486
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:18,920
Yeah.

1487
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,660
Oh, thank God.

1488
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,780
Thank God.

1489
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,560
He, like, picked up the shroom and just ate it.

1490
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,500
Okay, he's worked up.

1491
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,160
That's good!

1492
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,020
That's good!

1493
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,960
He still hasn't used his attack!

1494
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,980
That's good, guys!

1495
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,320
We're gonna make it!

1496
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,420
Alright, big damage!

1497
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,120
Big damage!

1498
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,720
Big money!

1499
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,360
Yay!

1500
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,440
We survived!

1501
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,300
Alright!

1502
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,440
Let's heal ourselves real quick.

1503
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:51,720
Wait.

1504
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,120
Oh, wait.

1505
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,340
Okay, guys.

1506
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,760
We gotta go back home.

1507
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,120
Oh, it's uproot!

1508
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,620
Alright, let's get uproot real quick.

1509
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,180
Just throw a baseball cap at it.

1510
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,340
Me and my 99 balls.

1511
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,180
Oh, shit.

1512
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:05,520
Okay.

1513
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,200
That's fine.

1514
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,800
We have, like, 98 now.

1515
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,690
He's not gonna do anything.

1516
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:16,890
Look at him.

1517
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,210
That's fine.

1518
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:20,570
I have more to try.

1519
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,130
Okay, maybe... Okay, I'm gonna damage him.

1520
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,410
Yeah, I'm gonna go hit him once.

1521
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:27,470
Oh, shit!

1522
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,010
Alright, let's get Stickbug in here.

1523
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:32,810
Actually, no.

1524
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:33,290
Husky.

1525
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,570
So we can stuns for him.

1526
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,860
Let's Topsy-Turvy.

1527
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,380
Alright, let's stuns for this.

1528
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,980
Oh, wait.

1529
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:51,640
Is it not?

1530
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,200
Oh, it doesn't affect him.

1531
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,160
Alright, we draw locking.

1532
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,320
I know it's, like, dark.

1533
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,960
Put me in when you get him.

1534
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,560
He's handsome.

1535
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,380
Wait, what?

1536
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,000
What the fuck is that?

1537
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,330
He's, like...

1538
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,550
He took off his clothes.

1539
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,190
He's naked now.

1540
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,630
Oh, my God.

1541
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,030
He's naked.

1542
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,530
He's, like...

1543
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,410
He's, like, now look at me.

1544
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,570
Oh, my God.

1545
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:36,770
Kaz is a flasher.

1546
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,710
Good creep.

1547
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,210
He's naked.

1548
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,720
What does he want from me?

1549
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,160
Alright, crunch.

1550
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,400
Maybe crunch will work.

1551
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,480
Crunch on him.

1552
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,820
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1553
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,140
Yeah, that's why you wanted to be him.

1554
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,280
He lulled me into the false sense of security.

1555
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,680
And then took off his jacket.

1556
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,900
Rusk, thank you for the super chat.

1557
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,200
Thank you.

1558
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:14,800
Thank you.

1559
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,000
Can't be uprooted.

1560
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,100
He looks like me for real.

1561
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,540
The red eyes for not sleeping.

1562
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,420
Yep, that's...

1563
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,560
And the nakedness?

1564
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,460
And...

1565
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1566
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,780
Thank you.

1567
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,520
Thank you.

1568
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,740
Oh, my God.

1569
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:33,620
He's actually so hard.

1570
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,660
Why is he so hard to fucking capture?

1571
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,980
Oh, my God.

1572
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,520
I don't want to kill him, too.

1573
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,820
Because he already wasted so much of my resources.

1574
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,160
I'll send a stick bug.

1575
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,280
All right.

1576
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,380
Uh...

1577
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:51,980
I'll bite.

1578
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,660
Jesus.

1579
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,420
That's not good.

1580
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,060
What the fuck?

1581
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,700
What?

1582
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,580
What is funny?

1583
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,760
Okay, um, guys, I... No, it wasn't even weak!

1584
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,120
It was just average!

1585
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,660
There wasn't no, it's super effective, they didn't even say that!

1586
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,160
Oh my god.

1587
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,080
Stick bug!

1588
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,380
Why are you useless?

1589
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,500
Why are you... Yes, but I don't wanna kill him!

1590
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,400
I don't wanna kill him!

1591
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,740
I'm trying not to kill him!

1592
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,200
Oh my god, I have nothing!

1593
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:49,940
I don't even... I don't even know what half of his moves are!

1594
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,660
I haven't seen... I haven't seen you in so long!

1595
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:54,720
Alright.

1596
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,380
Oh my god, what are your... What are your attacks?

1597
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,960
That's it, let's get Hefty in there.

1598
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,840
Stick bug is literally just, like, there to look pretty.

1599
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,160
It's nothing else.

1600
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,920
We're not parasoning him!

1601
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,800
He'll die!

1602
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,260
Oh my god, I'm just gonna kill him!

1603
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:31,980
I swear to god, if this kills him, I swear to god, this is, like, my least... I swear to god... Oh, thank god.

1604
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,020
It doesn't matter.

1605
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:33,980
Hahaha!

1606
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,420
All my other three moves are too strong!

1607
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,020
No, I... I feel like Slash is just gonna kill him.

1608
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,020
Oh my god, who... You know what?

1609
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,660
I'm not surprised.

1610
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,240
The scariest thing to ever encounter is a... is a naked person.

1611
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,240
In public.

1612
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,320
That's the scariest.

1613
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,860
Cause there's like... They're like, no fear.

1614
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:01,960
Hahaha!

1615
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,720
It's like, no fear at all.

1616
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,320
Hahaha!

1617
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:12,620
How?

1618
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,300
What?

1619
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:16,920
Alright.

1620
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,340
They're really... Yeah, streakers are really fast, too.

1621
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,440
How is he, like, the hard... I swear...

1622
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,780
I bought... I took a loan for these balls.

1623
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:28,500
I...

1624
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,940
I... I took a loan for these... For these caps!

1625
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:38,420
I am not using majority of my caps on this fucking uproot!

1626
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,060
on this naked man!

1627
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,480
I fought the... How?

1628
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:52,070
Alright.

1629
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:55,230
Oh, this is not looking so good, guys.

1630
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:56,350
Please.

1631
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:58,710
I went into debt!

1632
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,610
I have loaned sharks on me.

1633
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,690
Why?

1634
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:10,640
Oh my god!

1635
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:11,800
No!

1636
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,220
It's gonna pass!

1637
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,700
Rice!

1638
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,860
Don't do this to me, Rice!

1639
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:21,820
Don't!

1640
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,100
Rice!

1641
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,420
I used some!

1642
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,080
Please!

1643
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,200
Oh, thank god!

1644
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:35,880
Oh!

1645
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,240
Oh my god!

1646
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,420
It was a...

1647
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,280
Hot out!

1648
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,720
Oh, thank god!

1649
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:43,820
Oh!

1650
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,100
Everything's okay.

1651
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,660
I mean, everything is okay.

1652
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,120
Rice just wanted to add, like, more tension to this fight.

1653
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,600
Oh my god!

1654
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,380
I got an actual move now.

1655
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,680
Thank a fucking god!

1656
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,460
Alright.

1657
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,880
There we go.

1658
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,690
Just for this fucker.

1659
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,870
Alright.

1660
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,670
An onion that can stretch its root to reach high platforms.

1661
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,350
It wears its pot as a helmet to defend itself from attack.

1662
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,490
It is a natural gymnast.

1663
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:22,990
Alright.

1664
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:24,110
What was it?

1665
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:24,610
Was it Kaz?

1666
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,790
He hasn't been named yet, right, guys?

1667
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:29,890
I already...

1668
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,710
We named so many goons that I've lost track on who hasn't been named.

1669
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:36,550
Alright.

1670
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,570
No, I'm putting you somewhere else.

1671
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,410
No, you were actual hell.

1672
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,350
I'm putting you somewhere else.

1673
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:54,860
Alright.

1674
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,260
Oh, I don't have enough.

1675
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,020
Oh, wait.

1676
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,440
I have a better name, actually.

1677
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,220
I have a better name.

1678
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,680
I have a better name.

1679
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,520
I'll be right back getting milk.

1680
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,320
Don't worry.

1681
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,360
I'll come back for you.

1682
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,060
I'm just getting some milk real quick.

1683
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,140
I'll be right back.

1684
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,700
Just getting milk real quick.

1685
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,740
Alright, let's go.

1686
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,020
No, no, no, no.

1687
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,060
I haven't gotten yet.

1688
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,100
I'm getting milk.

1689
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,960
He never came back.

1690
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,060
I don't believe it.

1691
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:31,740
How many...

1692
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,080
Okay, I need to know how many caps did I use for that one guy.

1693
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,800
I have to know.

1694
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,860
I took a loan for this.

1695
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,280
I took a loan.

1696
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,560
I mean, chased by loan sharks.

1697
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,640
Not right now.

1698
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,100
Paroplank needs to learn his lesson, so leave me alone.

1699
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:56,960
Hey!

1700
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,800
Just where do you think you're going, huh?

1701
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,640
At least I tried to talk to this like a normal person before just walking past us.

1702
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,560
I did!

1703
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,380
And then you were like, get out of here.

1704
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,520
And I was like, okay.

1705
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,000
The absent parenting is why I picked up streaking.

1706
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,260
I was craving attention.

1707
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,800
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

1708
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,820
Thank you, thank you.

1709
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,180
It's important to make sure you have large enough party when tackling the jungle kingdom.

1710
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:26,360
No, I can't go off guard, but I call it small battles.

1711
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,820
So make sure you have enough party members.

1712
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,160
Hey, you.

1713
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,980
I can't let you pass.

1714
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,480
Lord Bowser's orders.

1715
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,000
Although, to be honest, the pay I've been getting, lady, hasn't been that good.

1716
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,660
It doesn't help that a purple coin economy recently crashed.

1717
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:42,480
Oops, guys.

1718
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,540
I started the second depression in Wario Land.

1719
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,940
Tell you what.

1720
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,740
You helped reimburse me for my loss, and I'll let you through.

1721
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,300
It doesn't merely fight.

1722
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:51,660
Nope.

1723
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:52,580
Sorry, then.

1724
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,760
You gotta turn back.

1725
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:54,700
Wait, what?

1726
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,620
Wait, what?

1727
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,020
I don't have 5,000 quads.

1728
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,340
I'm broke.

1729
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,440
What?

1730
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,790
What?

1731
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,680
I hate him.

1732
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,940
I hate Captain Toad.

1733
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,980
I hate him so much.

1734
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,180
Now he borrows $5,000 from me?

1735
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,620
Hey!

1736
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,240
These wild battles are sins for me and my strategy.

1737
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,540
I hate Captain Toad.

1738
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,420
Why did I save him?

1739
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,180
I should have let him die.

1740
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,800
Why did I save this bucket?

1741
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:05,800
Oh, yeah?

1742
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,400
You were saying the sandstorm?

1743
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,720
Now I'm gonna make it sunny.

1744
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,060
Alright, I'll pick him up.

1745
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,420
Okay, never mind.

1746
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,420
I should have let...

1747
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,420
I should have let him die out there in the...

1748
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,160
On the clouds.

1749
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,340
Remember when he was just trapped on the clouds?

1750
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,160
When he needed my help?

1751
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,860
I should have just let him die.

1752
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,060
The sunlight is strong.

1753
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,420
Okay, now I can use fireball.

1754
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,920
And now I'll pick him up.

1755
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,240
I'm gonna pick up a tornado.

1756
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,080
How bad can it be?

1757
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:48,620
Yay!

1758
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,300
Is this Captain Toad game even good?

1759
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,120
That's right.

1760
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,500
Pick him up!

1761
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,820
That's fucking right!

1762
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,940
Now drop him.

1763
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,980
It's a fun puzzle game.

1764
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,860
Never played it later.

1765
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,100
I really wanna play, what's it called?

1766
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,360
The Yoshi's Yarn World.

1767
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,200
That was really fun.

1768
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:26,060
I actually bought like the amiibos for it.

1769
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,300
Alright, take him up!

1770
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,140
I thought they were really cute.

1771
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,080
Wait, did the fireball not work?

1772
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,000
I wasn't paying attention.

1773
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:40,740
Alright,

1774
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,300
we'll use the normal one.

1775
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,640
It's where...

1776
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,180
It's where they're like yarn...

1777
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,280
Yarn Yoshi's.

1778
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,270
Yay!

1779
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:01,830
I'm the 132.

1780
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,290
Am I supposed to...

1781
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,770
Okay, I'm gonna go down so I can grab items.

1782
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,030
Or yellow shell.

1783
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,670
And then...

1784
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:19,510
Ultra Syrup.

1785
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,820
That's right.

1786
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:24,720
I'll...

1787
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,140
Hey!

1788
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:25,840
Stop!

1789
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,540
In the name of Lord Bowser!

1790
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,880
Alright.

1791
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,120
Tough Puff and Paratrooper.

1792
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,720
Okay, I don't know.

1793
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,620
Maybe ice?

1794
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,060
I think ice would work against them.

1795
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,380
Alright, pick up that cloud!

1796
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,600
Pick him up!

1797
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,620
That's right!

1798
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,720
Up you go!

1799
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,100
That's right.

1800
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,960
Take him to the edge!

1801
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:02,400
Where the sky meets the space!

1802
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,360
Oh, of course you fucking use protect.

1803
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,920
Oh, nice!

1804
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,580
It did a lot.

1805
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,440
Oh, of course.

1806
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,700
Of course they did it on my fucking guy.

1807
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,100
Wait, did I transform?

1808
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,900
Wait, I didn't transform!

1809
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,500
What the fuck?

1810
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,020
You had one job!

1811
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:31,980
You just...

1812
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,380
All you have to do is turn!

1813
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,940
Oh, it neutralized!

1814
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:39,840
Oh!

1815
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,180
Oh, that's okay.

1816
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,080
I still killed him.

1817
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:43,780
That's fine.

1818
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,600
I should have killed him soon.

1819
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,020
I should have killed the gas sooner.

1820
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,000
Useless!

1821
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,640
Useless cloud!

1822
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,240
I need it anyway.

1823
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,560
Yeah, I got lucky four hit.

1824
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,940
Also, it doesn't even matter if my guy...

1825
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,240
If the hammer bro levels up.

1826
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,040
Because, like...

1827
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,420
He's not even that important.

1828
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,520
Like, he's not even part of my team.

1829
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:14,360
Ah!

1830
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,440
There's something nice about fixing these waters!

1831
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,320
Despite their harshness!

1832
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,320
Oh, okay.

1833
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:20,720
There we go.

1834
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:21,840
What's that?

1835
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,680
A toad?

1836
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,640
Oh, man.

1837
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,240
This is gonna be a cinch.

1838
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,080
Alpharet said this was the buggiest part.

1839
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:31,840
Oh, okay.

1840
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,300
I'm not surprised because there's like two mechanics to it.

1841
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,060
What would be good against this?

1842
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:41,740
I assume...

1843
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,660
I'll assume ice again.

1844
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,300
All right, pick him up!

1845
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:47,680
Yes!

1846
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,320
Pick him up!

1847
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,460
That's right!

1848
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,420
Keep picking him up.

1849
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,800
I don't know what the snooze orb is from.

1850
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,720
What game is snooze orb is from?

1851
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,900
Okay, ice toss.

1852
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,240
Oh, that did nothing.

1853
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:19,500
Oh, that's bad.

1854
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,320
Oh, that also did nothing.

1855
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,420
Oh!

1856
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,140
Whoops!

1857
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,260
Oh!

1858
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,260
Wait, what?

1859
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,840
He's ice?!

1860
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,940
Oh, shit!

1861
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,560
Okay, it's rain time!

1862
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,300
I didn't realize...

1863
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,520
Guys, I didn't realize he was ice.

1864
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:53,600
Who would have thought blue means ice, guys?

1865
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,760
Who would have thought?

1866
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,160
Whoops!

1867
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,700
Ice, ice, ice, baby.

1868
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,300
Okay, it's okay.

1869
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,380
Now I'm water.

1870
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,200
Well, he is blue.

1871
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,480
Wait, I should be using sunny day.

1872
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,120
Fuck!

1873
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,140
Why did I just...

1874
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,660
Why did I just...

1875
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,760
Sorry, I...

1876
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,680
Wrong one.

1877
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,660
Oh, it still works!

1878
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,440
Nice, alright.

1879
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,920
Nice, it's alright.

1880
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,780
I still killed him.

1881
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,840
I still got it.

1882
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,480
I still...

1883
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,060
I still...

1884
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:33,420
Yay!

1885
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,520
Never punished!

1886
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:36,860
Let's go!

1887
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,940
Oh, fuck.

1888
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:40,380
Okay.

1889
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,900
This is bad.

1890
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,400
Alright, sunny day.

1891
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,880
Actually, no, it shouldn't be fine, right?

1892
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,960
No, it should be fine.

1893
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,800
Alright, pick him up, too!

1894
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,180
Yay!

1895
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,520
Blunt Force Trauma with a boomerang.

1896
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:56,920
Aww!

1897
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,640
Maybe I should use...

1898
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,000
Yeah, I think you're right, guys.

1899
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,340
I think I should use...

1900
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,100
I should have used fire.

1901
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,420
It's okay.

1902
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,640
Sunny day.

1903
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,760
Sure things will be okay now, right?

1904
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,260
Okay.

1905
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,000
Never punish!

1906
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,440
Let's go!

1907
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,460
Oh, there you got it.

1908
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:23,780
Okay.

1909
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:24,740
Never punish!

1910
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:25,960
Let's go!

1911
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,460
Praise the sun!

1912
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,440
Okay, now it should be okay.

1913
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:33,580
Okay.

1914
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,780
I chose, like, all the wrong elements.

1915
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,080
Which I've noticed.

1916
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,720
I literally chose...

1917
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:53,360
There were, like...

1918
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,420
It was, like, three choices...

1919
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,100
And I already fucked up the first...

1920
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,080
And I chose the...

1921
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,140
The wrong one.

1922
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:58,680
Twice.

1923
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,710
Never punish!

1924
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:06,650
Let's go!

1925
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,100
Yay!

1926
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,520
Hey!

1927
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,240
Just where you think you're going, huh?

1928
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,660
I'll just try to talk to normal to us.

1929
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,080
Looks like...

1930
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,440
Kara Blanc and Goomp.

1931
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:25,460
Can we call Mario over?

1932
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:27,440
What?

1933
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,180
A Toad?

1934
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,600
Do you need something from us?

1935
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:32,640
Goomp!

1936
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,320
Lock in!

1937
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,400
We're surrounded!

1938
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:35,860
Gah!

1939
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,040
Mario.

1940
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,000
How dare you take advantage of our petty arguments.

1941
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,100
We'll take care of you once and for all now.

1942
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:45,720
All right.

1943
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,040
So, Toad is gonna die soon.

1944
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,240
Toad does not look so good.

1945
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,960
But it's okay.

1946
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,880
I know Toad's just gonna use...

1947
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,540
Just gonna change the weather non-stop.

1948
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,420
I didn't know how to patch my game.

1949
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,480
Apparently, the new patch makes it so...

1950
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,280
Anyway, before I say it, I'm gonna squish some Goombas.

1951
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,560
The new patch makes it so that he doesn't only use weather moves.

1952
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,600
But like...

1953
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,560
I did not know how to do it.

1954
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,080
I...

1955
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,160
I don't know how to patch games.

1956
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,620
So, I'm just like, oh well.

1957
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,900
All right, that should like, fully crush him.

1958
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,160
Yeah.

1959
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,160
All right.

1960
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,640
Now it's time to see if...

1961
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,460
Uh...

1962
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:39,840
Nope.

1963
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,240
Okay.

1964
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,640
Oh my god.

1965
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,400
This Hammer Pro knows more than one attack move?

1966
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,040
Oh my god.

1967
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,560
That's the life.

1968
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,620
I wish Toad also knows more than one attack move.

1969
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,220
You patched the game to a new base rom, I think.

1970
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:58,760
Yeah, okay.

1971
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,340
I...

1972
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,180
Yeah, that's too much.

1973
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,970
That's too much, guys.

1974
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,790
I'm too stupid to do that.

1975
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:12,980
I'm just...

1976
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,020
I'm just here to game.

1977
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,900
I'm not here to patch stuff.

1978
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,280
If I can't patch something with one click of a button, then like...

1979
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,100
I'm hopeless.

1980
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,480
One click only.

1981
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,580
That's my motto.

1982
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,500
It's so real.

1983
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,220
If it's not streamlined, then I can't do it.

1984
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,460
Because I'm scared.

1985
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,800
He's the king of...

1986
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,560
He's a big boy.

1987
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,280
He's the king of all bombs.

1988
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,280
That's right.

1989
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,040
We gotta feed him more.

1990
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,080
Give him more food.

1991
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,220
He hungers.

1992
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,200
He's so hungry.

1993
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,900
King Dad.

1994
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:15,640
You'll pay for this.

1995
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,640
Oh my god.

1996
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,860
We did it, Mario!

1997
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,380
We're finally reunited!

1998
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,700
It was a bit scary, I can't lie.

1999
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,480
But I knew we managed to get through it together.

2000
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,000
Now, onwards to the gone capital!

2001
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,100
Okay, I do not want to be Mario.

2002
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,560
I do not want to be Toad.

2003
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,300
All right.

2004
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,540
Where do I have to go?

2005
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,700
I don't even remember.

2006
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,880
Oh, I don't remember now.

2007
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,060
Wait, there's...

2008
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:50,820
Wait, what?

2009
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,200
Oh, it's a statue of him.

2010
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,220
I was like...

2011
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:54,820
What the fuck?

2012
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,460
Wait, he's right there.

2013
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,120
Okay.

2014
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:58,660
Oh my god.

2015
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,800
I have to walk...

2016
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,140
I have to hold your hand over too?

2017
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,640
Jesus Christ, you're useless!

2018
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,300
Why did they give you your own game?

2019
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,310
Okay, and now I just need to talk to him.

2020
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:21,270
All right.

2021
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,290
Here we go.

2022
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:25,930
It's visitors?

2023
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,710
Nice to meet you.

2024
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:30,370
I love super...

2025
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,370
Oh my god, is this a super...

2026
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:31,510
Okay.

2027
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:35,030
My boy has a really tough time putting out advice and doing anything.

2028
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:36,610
Like taking a shower.

2029
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:40,470
But I thought I bought him a new game that teaches him how to take a shower.

2030
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:43,530
But can I get to play a disc on a cartridge device?

2031
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,870
None of it makes sense to me.

2032
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:48,230
That move is more useful to you than him.

2033
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,130
Yes, he loves Mario Bros 3.

2034
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:54,970
They all love Mario Bros 3.

2035
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,950
That's the secret.

2036
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:57,790
What the fuck is that?

2037
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:02,290
This is my seat.

2038
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,550
I was at 12 hours before the show starts.

2039
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:05,950
Don't challenge me.

2040
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:10,570
I've always pitched for a slime poetry night.

2041
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:12,570
It keeps getting rejected.

2042
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:15,390
But I tell him it's not about slapping cards to the ground.

2043
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:19,770
This is where Cranky on did his famous banana hack.

2044
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,490
No one could stay in their seats.

2045
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:22,590
Oh wait, is this a show?

2046
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,870
Just a lot of courage to come up on stage and perform.

2047
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:28,570
Just being here makes me so nervous.

2048
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,910
Oh, is this like a comedy club?

2049
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:33,030
Oh, it's a little comedy club.

2050
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,310
Okay.

2051
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:38,090
What's over here?

2052
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,590
Cranky Kong performs comedy every night at Jay Apes.

2053
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:46,650
Oh, this has a big crowd.

2054
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:48,630
So I want to see what the big deal is.

2055
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:49,390
Oh my...

2056
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:49,970
I heard like...

2057
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,590
Hey, Nintendo...

2058
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,330
Hasn't added like, um...

2059
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:59,370
Super Mario Odyssey characters to their newer games yet.

2060
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:00,730
And people are mad.

2061
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,490
I saw like a Twitter post about it.

2062
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,570
How people were like...

2063
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:09,590
Sad that Mario Odyssey characters are like...

2064
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:10,130
Not...

2065
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,510
Are like, uh...

2066
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:12,190
Being ignored.

2067
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:13,790
Army!

2068
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,190
Today we stand on the...

2069
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:17,630
Precipice...

2070
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:19,030
Precipice of greatness.

2071
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:19,590
What?

2072
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:22,930
On the verge of seizing the ultimate prize.

2073
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:25,330
The golden banana.

2074
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,210
One so tame.

2075
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:31,290
Those stinky apes will have to turn their sights at me.

2076
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,770
My presence will be demanded.

2077
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:37,150
So rally my Koopa Troopas.

2078
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,270
Rally my Koombas.

2079
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:42,850
Rally to the call of Bowser.

2080
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,470
Charge!

2081
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,660
Mamma...

2082
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:52,400
Mamma Mia!

2083
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,040
I thought it was me.

2084
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,400
Until I saw Captain Toad.

2085
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:00,780
Yes.

2086
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,500
So inspirational.

2087
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,080
I'm gonna cry.

2088
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,040
Hello.

2089
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,360
Hello, I can speak mushroom fish.

2090
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:09,820
Good.

2091
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,320
I live Kong Capital.

2092
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,480
Hi, Mario!

2093
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,180
I'm gonna get a really special break.

2094
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,460
Record all of them.

2095
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,760
I'm not gonna read this.

2096
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,420
Not important.

2097
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,160
Oh, I should save.

2098
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:21,640
You're right.

2099
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,520
I'll save real quick.

2100
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,100
How many stars are there, anyway, in Super Mario mod?

2101
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:35,310
Ho-ha-ho!

2102
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:36,690
Gotta save it!

2103
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:43,370
It's customer to gift a call in their first cart once they learn how to crawl.

2104
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:46,950
Why learn how to walk when you can drive?

2105
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:47,930
That is so true.

2106
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:51,830
I say as I learn how to drive and never drove again.

2107
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:53,990
Road work ahead.

2108
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:54,810
Oh, sorry.

2109
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:55,270
I went...

2110
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,330
I went toad for some reason.

2111
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:57,250
Road work ahead.

2112
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:58,770
Yeah, I sure hope it does.

2113
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:02,690
What's this?

2114
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:03,750
Oh, is this a shop?

2115
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,790
Hop, step, jump, jump, pool.

2116
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,150
That's craftery.

2117
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,030
Yeah, yeah, woo!

2118
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:12,930
Magical spell is E-E-Poo.

2119
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:13,550
See?

2120
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:14,210
Nothing!

2121
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:15,790
Wait, what game is that from?

2122
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,730
All right, let's see what I can buy.

2123
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,610
Okay, none of these work.

2124
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,210
New to the con capital?

2125
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:34,810
Well, there's plenty to do here.

2126
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,390
Not that I would know.

2127
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,910
It's actually my first time outside in a while.

2128
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:43,310
Working for Bowser is cool and all.

2129
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,850
Wait, will you look at this house?

2130
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,070
I'm set to settle here now.

2131
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:49,590
Monkeys?

2132
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:51,210
Oh, we're not easy.

2133
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:51,790
Listen!

2134
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,790
I'm not going...

2135
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:54,150
Oh, wait.

2136
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,370
Did he swear at us?

2137
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:58,630
Captain Toad did not want to translate that.

2138
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:01,930
What did he say, Captain Toad?

2139
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:03,210
What did he say?

2140
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,350
Wait, what's the way?

2141
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:08,370
Now, let's get my picture taken.

2142
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:10,870
Why is he so far?

2143
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:16,710
Wait, I can't even swim over there.

2144
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,440
Finally, I can understand what everyone is saying thanks to this translator.

2145
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,820
Makes some really handy adventures, doesn't he?

2146
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:29,620
Wait.

2147
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,560
I didn't even have to use...

2148
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,700
Captain Toad didn't even have to be here.

2149
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,020
Oh, it's the Safari Zone!

2150
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:40,400
Wait.

2151
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,760
What kind of cool mods are in the Safari Zone?

2152
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:46,640
Oh, no.

2153
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,000
I have to get rid of him if I...

2154
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,440
Guys.

2155
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,680
If I beat this level, does he leave me alone?

2156
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,260
I need to know.

2157
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,200
Does he leave me alone?

2158
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,040
When I beat Conland?

2159
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,640
Donkey Conland?

2160
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,580
Okay.

2161
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,160
Thank God.

2162
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:08,540
Okay.

2163
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:08,940
I'm leaving.

2164
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,440
I'm fucking getting out of here.

2165
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,260
Alright, we'll come back to Safari Zone later.

2166
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:17,640
I cannot deal with...

2167
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,560
I cannot deal with...

2168
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,540
With Toad.

2169
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,680
We'll come back later without you.

2170
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:32,590
Want to see the castle?

2171
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:34,550
Wow!

2172
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:39,850
I want to challenge it, but I can't swim up waterfalls.

2173
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:41,490
Wait, I can either.

2174
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,560
Okay, goodbye.

2175
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,220
Wait, I can't swim up either.

2176
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:53,820
Wait.

2177
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,180
I need to progress there?!

2178
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,240
Oh, man.

2179
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,460
Oh, jeez.

2180
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,380
I hate you.

2181
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,380
I hate you.

2182
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,600
And I get stick bug too.

2183
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,320
Oh, he yields me.

2184
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:23,620
Yay!

2185
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,340
Yippee!

2186
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,760
I don't have enough energy.

2187
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:36,800
Oh!

2188
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,420
Look at the Jabby!

2189
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:41,100
Alright, let's catch Jabby real quick.

2190
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:44,540
Guys.

2191
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,020
I'm gonna catch Jabby and I'm gonna call it here.

2192
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,280
I'm actually so tired.

2193
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,300
I think if I didn't have this...

2194
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,320
Okay, I spent...

2195
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,380
I'll say that...

2196
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,100
I was there for a very long time.

2197
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,600
I'll just say that.

2198
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,580
I was there for a while.

2199
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,900
That's why I'm like...

2200
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:15,560
That's why I'm like...

2201
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,120
Yeah, I didn't think it would be...

2202
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,180
I'll say...

2203
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,160
It was a long time.

2204
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:33,160
If I didn't have to go in there for that long...

2205
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,800
I'd have more energy.

2206
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,260
I did.

2207
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,320
I...

2208
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,080
I had like...

2209
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,320
Um...

2210
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,500
Actually, um...

2211
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,720
It got something to eat before...

2212
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,180
Uh...

2213
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:44,960
Before the stream.

2214
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,360
I didn't think there was like...

2215
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,860
So much prep work going in.

2216
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:50,960
I'm like...

2217
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,240
Doing it for free, too.

2218
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,580
I mean, I guess...

2219
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,660
I get like early access.

2220
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:56,680
So...

2221
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:57,900
But I was like...

2222
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:58,960
I didn't expect like...

2223
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,380
The prep was like...

2224
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,440
So much.

2225
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,320
I got early access.

2226
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:10,720
No!

2227
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,280
Let me catch you!

2228
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,980
That Jabby is strong.

2229
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:15,380
I don't want...

2230
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:15,760
I can't...

2231
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,760
I'm worried I'll kill it.

2232
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,840
That's why I don't want to...

2233
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,660
I don't want to do any damage to it.

2234
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:21,760
Because like...

2235
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,200
That's definitely gonna kill it.

2236
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:23,900
For sure.

2237
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,060
Like, he's too strong.

2238
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:30,730
Oh my god.

2239
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:31,330
Please.

2240
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:32,370
Hammer, bro.

2241
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:32,970
Please.

2242
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:38,210
Let me catch you!

2243
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:42,130
Yeah.

2244
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:42,890
Yeah.

2245
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:45,210
I'll talk more about it tomorrow.

2246
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:46,310
Oh my god.

2247
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:47,450
He's dead.

2248
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,110
He's dead.

2249
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:51,330
I swear to god.

2250
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:52,130
Trash goon.

2251
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,030
If you kill him.

2252
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:54,210
I swear to god.

2253
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,140
Goodbye, dad.

2254
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,280
Rush!

2255
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,220
Thank you for the super chat.

2256
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:05,580
Thank you.

2257
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:06,040
Thank you.

2258
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:06,280
Okay.

2259
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,780
If I catch Jabby...

2260
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,460
Why is that so strong?

2261
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,220
Rush.

2262
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,140
If I manage to catch Jabby...

2263
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,560
I'll name you after Jabby.

2264
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:19,800
All right.

2265
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,760
It's time to lick him.

2266
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:21,280
Okay.

2267
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,160
That did nothing.

2268
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,920
I can't.

2269
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,960
I was only able to bring out three of my Mario Mons.

2270
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,860
I could.

2271
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,180
If I could, I would.

2272
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:41,620
He brought three of them.

2273
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:46,600
Because Captain Toad took off the majority of my other Mons spaces.

2274
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,880
Oh my god.

2275
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,480
Guys, this is not looking so good.

2276
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,320
I think I'm gonna die to a singular Jabby.

2277
01:32:59,320 --> 01:32:59,940
I...

2278
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:07,680
One singular Jabby.

2279
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,960
Oh my god.

2280
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,720
Oh thank god.

2281
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,600
I can't use anything.

2282
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,300
It's gonna...

2283
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:16,560
Okay.

2284
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,680
I'm gonna try a Magnet Bomb.

2285
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,220
Oh.

2286
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,200
That was close.

2287
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,460
Oh my god.

2288
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,140
That was close.

2289
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,940
That was so close.

2290
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,060
Oh my god.

2291
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:33,500
Please.

2292
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,680
One fly versus a hundred goons.

2293
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,400
You're one HP.

2294
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,680
Are you still fighting for your life?

2295
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,660
I don't understand.

2296
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,020
Oh my god.

2297
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,960
How is he so strong?

2298
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:54,110
I have to use heal.

2299
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:58,830
I can't let this one singular Jabby kill everything.

2300
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:02,070
I actually have to heal.

2301
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:04,030
Oh my god.

2302
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:10,170
Okay.

2303
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:11,950
That's my strongest.

2304
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,210
You don't understand.

2305
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,130
The baseball cap.

2306
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,070
I...

2307
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:18,390
I took a loan for these caps.

2308
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:24,070
The little bug that could...

2309
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:25,490
How is he...

2310
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:27,150
So strong.

2311
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:29,790
Who voided my Jab...

2312
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,990
My wild run.

2313
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:33,110
All right.

2314
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:33,950
Who was it?

2315
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,230
Bro, that guy was like...

2316
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:38,130
That guy was on all sorts of drugs.

2317
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,990
Oh my god.

2318
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,210
The rare catch.

2319
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,830
Holy shit.

2320
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:52,770
A large mature mosquito.

2321
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:55,890
Its body grows stubby hairs that allows it to enhance sense of touch.

2322
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:58,810
Is known to be very territorial and even wage tiny wars.

2323
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,810
He is like EV trained in the wild.

2324
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:04,070
Okay.

2325
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:06,450
All right.

2326
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:07,190
All right.

2327
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:07,870
Can someone...

2328
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:08,470
Who was...

2329
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,710
Can someone type the name again?

2330
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:10,970
Because I don't have the record.

2331
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:17,900
Uh...

2332
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,040
R-O-S-C-H.

2333
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:19,320
Okay.

2334
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,380
R-O-S...

2335
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,800
Super chat...

2336
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,380
Like...

2337
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,080
Scrored up.

2338
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,460
And I...

2339
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,240
And I gotta make sure.

2340
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,320
All right.

2341
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,760
Rosh, boon.

2342
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,780
You are too strong.

2343
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:37,520
All right.

2344
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:38,700
I'm gonna save it here.

2345
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,580
Ah, this is a really short stream, guys.

2346
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,060
I'm sorry.

2347
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:42,700
This is a really short stream.

2348
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:45,460
I am very exhausted from the...

2349
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:45,680
Today.

2350
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,980
I'm very exhausted from today.

2351
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:54,340
And...

2352
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:56,780
And having to...

2353
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,120
To do the stuff that I have to do tomorrow.

2354
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:02,360
But...

2355
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,700
I did have a lot of fun, though.

2356
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:04,780
Hanging out with you guys.

2357
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,260
And I hope you guys still had fun with me.

2358
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,320
Even though it was a really short stream today.

2359
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,140
Um...

2360
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,640
I really wanted to play longer.

2361
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:13,420
Like, finish Donkey Kong Land.

2362
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,980
But, like, my eyes are actually...

2363
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,940
Like, drooping down.

2364
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,220
Like, my eyes are actually, like...

2365
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:20,040
Really tired.

2366
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,960
So, that's when I knew I had to call it.

2367
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:24,440
But...

2368
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:24,820
I'm like...

2369
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:25,460
And then, like...

2370
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,460
I still have to...

2371
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:29,400
I still have to do more stuff with...

2372
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,180
Lai Mu and Zentraya, too.

2373
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:32,340
Um...

2374
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:33,360
After this stream.

2375
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,240
Um...

2376
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,260
So, that's why I was like...

2377
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:36,580
Oh, I'm gonna be so dead.

2378
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:38,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2379
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,880
But I'll explain more...

2380
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,140
About why tomorrow.

2381
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:42,540
But anyway, guys.

2382
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:43,360
Um...

2383
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,780
As always, everybody...

2384
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:45,800
Stay hydrated.

2385
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,720
Posture check.

2386
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:47,400
Oh...

2387
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:47,880
Oh my god.

2388
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,040
Stay hydrated.

2389
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:51,100
Posture check.

2390
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:52,380
Get up and move around to get that...

2391
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,720
Sorry, I forgot my outro for a second.

2392
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,680
Because, like...

2393
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,780
That's how eepy I am.

2394
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:57,820
Um...

2395
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:58,700
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2396
01:36:59,580 --> 01:36:59,840
Wait.

2397
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:00,640
Say hydrated.

2398
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:01,120
Posture.

2399
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:02,500
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

2400
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,180
And you stay up for me.

2401
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,100
Head to bed.

2402
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:04,640
Cause...

2403
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,400
You deserve it.

2404
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,080
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2405
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:08,520
Bye, guys.

2406
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:09,800
Bye!

2407
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:12,720
Bye!

2408
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,940
We'll be right back.
