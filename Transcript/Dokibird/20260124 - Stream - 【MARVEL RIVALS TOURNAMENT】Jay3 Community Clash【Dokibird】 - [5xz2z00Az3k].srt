I'm gonna put it right here.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:45,520
Like I need to be micromanaged in the high screen
environment because I have the least the least experience

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
out of everybody.

50
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,200
And but I but then like they're treating me as if I know
what I'm doing.

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,520
So then I was just chucking because I was just like go NW.

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm just like when do I chuck my all and then I was just
chucking my rocket all rat like whatever like whenever I

53
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:11,780
feel like like in my gut feeling was right but it was not
right well the last seven days i played how many games i

54
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,520
played internet because i was like i don't know where to put
my own no one's telling me where to put my own okay here's

55
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,920
my own 120.

56
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:34,880
this is like here it is this is i did i do okay and then and
then i felt apparent i did not it was it was it was not an

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,620
okay uh save gambit i guess teammates are a bit loud i don't
know what sound guy is here i do believe you're back but i

58
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,320
will turn them down i think you make i'll turn everybody
down see if they're gonna play i'm just making like little

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,580
mistakes but this is very in my head i don't know no they
are these are all like yeah it's decision making i think you

60
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,640
need to shoot the enemy back they play every day i think you
should the enemy tank so much so i shouldn't get any

61
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,560
background more at the enemy angles like the phoenix the
starlord because once more i'm very important we shoot the

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,960
people outside of the healing range because then they need
to ask for healing like duck right and then the people turn

63
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:24,780
yeah which makes the emma lose hp in main you know i've been
more mindful of that i'm checking right now i don't think

64
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:34,700
any of my mods are online right now I just But I don't know
Ban Mantis or Loki I'm turning everybody down He would have

65
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,740

Because like I have all my other friends Set up correctly So

66
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,620
I worry about that I don't think we need to ban it We have
Invis safe I'm just saying I don't think we need to ban it

67
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:54,280
right now Yeah I DMed my head mod But I think he's asleep
too Pretty easy

68
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,230
But it's awkward.

69
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,170
I think this is anarchy tab.

70
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,070
We have no mods.

71
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,270
This might be anarchy.

72
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,890
We have no mods online.

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,910

74
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,250

I have to look at my screen.

80
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,710

the support.

339
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,770

Go kill it.

343
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,670
He's the only guy who can touch.

344
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,470

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,490
Nice.

360
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,030
GG.

361
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,290
Oh my god, I know my screen was fucked up, but I couldn't do
anything about it.

362
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,890
Oh, it was so zoomed in.

363
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,550
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,310
Oh my God.

365
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,310
I was, I tried to do full screen.

366
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,890
Oh wait.

367
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,890
I think the sharks now you just arrived.

368
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,510
Let me fix it.

369
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,330
I don't know how to fix it.

370
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,830
Give me a sec.

371
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,970
No, but I need to wash it first.

372
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,110
I can't get in there.

373
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,820
See, I can fix it.

374
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,460
Oh my God.

375
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,360
I just so zoomed in.

376
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,900
I knew it was super zoomed in.

377
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,520
But I was just like, oh, I need to play a game.

378
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,640
Me can't focus.

379
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,120
Why is it at home?

380
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,840
Holy shit, why the fuck was it there?

381
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,940
How many teams do we play per round?

382
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,600
Just one team.

383
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,540
Yeah.

384
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,460
All right, now it's better.

385
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,240
I don't know why it was like that.

386
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't know.

387
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,020
Did my thing reset or some shit?

388
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,040
That's weird.

389
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,340
Imperator's team is playing against a pretty good team, too.

390
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,360
It's actually crazy.

391
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,830
They have Coach Cuffy.

392
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,190
All right.

393
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,590
I'm fixing everything.

394
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,290
I was so locked in.

395
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,190
I was very nervous.

396
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:19,090
no it's because like my res was for some reason at 2560
instead of 1920 the bite of 1920 so that's why i zoomed in

397
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:26,770
but like i was like i have to like start staggering yeah i
was shaking i'm just nervous especially when they have

398
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:36,030
static tanks within like 20 seconds with one stagger like
this is that this is literally like the most intense term

399
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:48,430
i've ever participated didn't so i'm like all over i'm like
oh it's literally my mood right now i'm gonna replay that

400
00:16:48,430 --> 00:17:03,650

this the you're right thank you i'm glad i'm glad you guys

401
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,970
think i'm doing okay the other way confused.

402
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,890
I won't think it's some way.

403
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,390
Mid-tone.

404
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,290
Yeah.

405
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,510
Like, I'm literally the baby in this team.

406
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,390
I'm literally like, please come baby, I'm sorry.

407
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,070
Yeah, I want to be micromanaged.

408
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,110
I want to be micromanaged so bad right now.

409
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,290
Yeah, I'm literally the little sister.

410
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:43,010
And like, it was so for me because we were screaming against
like the the best teams for this tournament and then the all

411
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:52,530
the teams knew i was the baby and then they're like get her
stop stop dying because they all like i didn't know what to

412
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:59,950
do that's like guys they're all trying to kill me and
they're like yeah because they knew you're the you're the

413
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:07,210
weakest out of all of us so they strategically are diving
you purpose because they know they could kill you very

414
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:07,670
easily.

415
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,810

everybody's to just you on eternity.

418
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,870
The Amazon driver was very confused.

419
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,530
I want to know, well, I'll turn out, trust me, a little bit,

473
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,740

00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,960
I mean, the problem is as long as I don't have my big E, I
can't really risk anything.

475
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,240
So I don't know if TPing behind is that good yet.

524
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,900
I can't hit a shot.

525
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,620
I'm one, I'm one.

526
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm dead.

527
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,760

535
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,080

536
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,760

Shoot the Luna, shoot the Luna.

547
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,380
Shoot the Luna.

548
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh, that's okay.

Shielding him up.

552
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,040
Shield him.

553
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,960
He can maybe kill him.

554
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,220
Walk up, walk up, walk up, walk up.

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,960

Get him a point.

567
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,220
I can get him a point.

568
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,880
He's on point.

569
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,400
Just leaps.

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,460
Mack dying, Mack dying.

577
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,600
Emma, Emma on point.

578
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,460
Emma on point.

579
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,160
Turn Emma, turn.

580
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,140
I pulled him back.

581
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,980
Take a picture.

582
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,340
Smile!

583
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,040
Okay.

584
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Okay.

585
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
Walk up, walk up Doki.

586
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,660
Take the swing.

587
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,840
Can I get flake?

588
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,100
Yeah.

589
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm going far right.

590
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,500
I'm gonna Phoenix saw here this fight.

591
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,860
I think just start that full loop.

592
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,300
Yeah, I can walk in the flap closed here.

593
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,060
I'm waiting for it.

594
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,500
Yeah, let them walk first.

595
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,500
Of course.

596
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,460
Yeah, yeah.

597
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,900
When they walk through the choke, okay?

598
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,000
It's like you wait until they walk through the choke, then I
can hit the back line.

599
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,840
I'm getting marked by Mag.

600
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,680
Oh, I couldn't get to you.

601
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,160
I pushed to him.

602
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,340
Ready?

603
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:20,980

604
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,280
That's fine.

605
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,540

606
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,240

I'm not here.

614
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,080
I got a chance here.

615
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,700
I'm going to go.

616
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,440
Yeah, let's swim.

617
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,520
Oh, bro.

618
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,580

619
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,140
Just wait.

620
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,520

621
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,040

00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,860
I can open the map from right.

630
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,620
I can open the map from right.

631
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,140

632
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,720

633
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,380

639
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,140

640
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:06,740
Hello, one.

641
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,040

642
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,340
Got her.

643
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,400

647
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,380
Got your back.

648
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,640
Emma's solo.

649
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,360
Okay, take a picture, okay?

650
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,060
Here, here, here, here.

651
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,380
Yeah, I'm with you.

652
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,460
Oh, I did it the wrong way.

653
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,040
It's mine.

654
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,900
I did it the wrong way.

655
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,860
I didn't get it.

656
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,560
I need to hear.

657
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,280
I love that right.

658
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,480
Yeah.

659
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,700
Oh, I knew it too.

660
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
I forgot he flips it.

661
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,100
Oh, it is the first game.

662
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,600
The games will get progressively harder because it's open
div rules.

663
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,820
Open division rules from Overwatch.

664
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,520
So you guys remember, it's like the more wins you get,
you're facing as other teams with the same record.

665
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:04,840
so like first game everyone has like blank record but then
it gets progressively harder and that's why I'm like oh yeah

666
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,580
so yeah it's Overwatch open div rules for like how the
format is yeah go back into the lot and screenshot it now

667
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:22,320
yeah Swiss system yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know what the
I just know it's that that one yeah and I used I played an

668
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:31,260
open div before so I remember the reroll is for it maybe i
should bring out my own snuggie brand 30 seconds before yeah

669
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:40,300
so i'm like trying to lock in as much as i can i've never
been as stressed out in a tournament before because it feels

670
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:50,120
like i'm competing again when i used to do tier two i feel
like i'm back in tier two hell this is why i left and became

a streamer i was like never again never again

672
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,480

750
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,940
You can even miss it.

752
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,260

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,630

765
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,950

00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,150
I can match him too.

797
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,290
They're all going left.

798
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,270
They're all going.

799
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:00,650
They're all going.

800
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,010

801
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,270

Back, left.

804
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,550
Hella, no bird.

805
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,410
Can we break?

806
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,190
Stop being a little bit.

807
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,510
I'm gonna try and break.

808
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,110

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,030
I pulled her back.

811
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,490
I pulled her back.

812
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,310
Oh, we can't get to you guys over there.

813
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:18,810
Leave the mag.

814
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,450
Don't kill the mag.

815
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,250
Okay.

816
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,590
Leave the make.

817
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,290
Says the guy that killed him.

818
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,410
Just keep holding the choke.

819
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,850
We don't have to play super kills.

820
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:32,830
I'm going to go for a flank ult, okay?

821
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,010
I've got upgrades.

822
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,010
Just let them take the long rotation.

823
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,270
I can hit them with my sword ult here.

824
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,470
Actually, I'm gonna go with gun bolt.

825
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,170
Don't go too early, not set up.

826
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,210
Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.

827
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,670

833
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,490
Baffling.

834
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,910
I'm altering her.

835
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:53,350
Keep up all.

836
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,350
Guide it guys.

837
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,910

00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,910
I'm, I think I'm dead here.

839
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,450
I'm fine, I'm fine.

840
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,310
Gonna use my arm.

00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,130

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,190
Oh, I'm dead.

843
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:01,650
I'm dead.

844
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,110
Oh, actually I should have wasted that.

845
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,410
Shoot her.

846
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,490
E'M, M-I-Emm, Emma, Emma, Emma.

847
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,970

848

She's dead.

849
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,190
Nice statement.Like, mech-mech, Mac, Mac, maybe?

850
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,050
I'm not going inside.

851
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,250
Okay, then we can handle.

852
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:10,430
Not image.

853
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,630

854
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,350

We can fight them, now.

858
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,210
I'm clapping backline here.

859
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,470
I pulled Neymar back.

860
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,290

861
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,070
In this one HP.

862
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,430
Clearly you needed some help.

863
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,150
Oh, how about Luna?

864
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,090

No support.

869
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:29,850

Three aliens, didn't we?

1038
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,420
Uh...

1039
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,620
Do you guys recognize those names?

1040
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,020
I think they're...

1041
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,200
They're definitely Asia.

1042
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,000
I think they're all EU.

1043
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,400
Oh, Asia.

1044
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,900
No, they're Asia.

1045
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,360
Really?

1046
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,240
It's probably Asia.

1047
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,640
Yeah, but the pain wise it's Asia.

1048
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,900
I'll be right back on it.

1049
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,460
It's definitely...

1050
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,620
Oh my god.

1051
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,820
That was...

1052
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:23,820
brazil oh someone said brazil yeah that makes sense too okay
yeah but it gets harder it gets progressively harder and

1053
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:31,420
harder the more teams we fight you need to wait you need to
wait until we drop on backline so how it works is basically

1054
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:38,020
we're fighting teams with the same record as us as we go up
so the more games we win the harder to type of thing you

1055
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:48,040
don't want to trade resources too early you know so i'm like
okay all right yeah i gotta wait for them to verify but i'd

1056
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,780
like second point on defense when i got pulled down i don't
i don't really know where i'm supposed to play there do you

1057
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:02,300
remember that i don't know which which situation i can watch
it apparently we fought uh it was a brazil team uh let me

1058
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:15,440
find it let's see i'm looking at what next match i wear like
uh 12 or 13 minutes like protein like the commercial thing

1059
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:25,160
yeah next like there i feel so awkward i don't know oh i'm
so when is your last 13 minutes when second point but okay

1060
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:37,720
our next match is in 13 13 is in 20 minutes okay yeah let me
see it's in 20 minutes okay you walk main not okay you're

1061
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,880
going to hop is fine like all forcing down top is good you
know i think it's important that you shoot up the hell out

1062
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:54,320
first though and uh and shoot off the walkout because you
want to avoid that we take a lot of damage right if i should

1063
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:01,000
shoot in the walkout should instantly do that because now
they got a lot of coupons in which caused our formation to

1064
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,520
crumble so we can't line up for invasiles right then next up
when we walk you know you want to take above them here

1065
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,020
because how many teams up you should just go in the on the
edge of the corner of the thing or more it could be more

1066
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:22,040
honestly that's kind of okay i want to like honestly i want
to obviously need to keep i want to not play on full stream

1067
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,460
before you might get most frames but because of the the fact
that you didn't shield out and walking like our team

1068
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:38,360
couldn't peek and then they peeked but not rapidly if you
already super chat thank you yeah so yeah because we can put

1069
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:48,760
oh yeah 600 teams yeah oh no no it's it's recommended but
it's not recommended but it's not required so we can we

1070
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:57,360
don't need that have stream delay everything we should do
that more often it's like what was our end goal for going up

1071
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,340
here like just like jump on them or i don't know i pay on
yeah it kind of felt it kind of Normally you would want

1072
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,880
Pella or Neymar on the high ground, right?

1073
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,560
Or Phoenix.

1074
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,280
But I guess we could have also...

1075
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,780
We could have had like a split, you know, Krook and Pella on
top and you were playing with someone else.

1076
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,000
1440p monitor.

1077
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,780
Because they obviously stuffed it.

1078
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,980
And we need to calculate whether we can fight the stuff or
not.

1079
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,100
And fighting into the emerald diamond here is pretty risky.

1080
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,380
So going main would have probably been the better play.

1081
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,460
We're learning a lot.

1082
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:24,800
Yeah.

1083
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,040
Like I feel like we do a lot of these plays where we go off.

1084
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,480
I don't know.

1085
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,660
I feel awkward in this play.

1086
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,340
Yeah.

1087
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:30,860
You know what I mean?

1088
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,020
when there's like i mean last last point and example is a
good example right you have to touch point at least that's

1089
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,160
what you feel like to do and into emma it kind of feels
rough right so you have to wait until me and duck develop on

1090
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,520
the backline that's when you walk on the point because once
the backline is contested you will win the resource trade

1091
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,100
against emma yeah before you lose the resource trade so if
you give them 600 teams no beam charge before that's bad for

1092
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,260
us or bad for you in the end because you have to touch point
against full beam emma so if you don't give him beam and

1093
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:06,380
then you touch the point last seconds he will be having
learning right now because he yeah charges people i'm

1094
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:13,940
learning today i'm processing information i'm processing
yeah but other than that i mean it's it's just also my bad

1095
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:28,620
my mic just cut out it probably is a vocal contacts oh what
is that in english you need to do it's eight rounds actually

1096
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:40,540
not seven it's eight rounds and um if the record seven one
you get an automatic access into uh into the finals

1097
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:53,600
basically because that bro i just say nothing i mean i just
say like what i have to say for this but i don't i

1098
00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:03,780
definitely i think i think i'm very much more suited for
creator tournaments oh the next match is at 12 15.

1099
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:14,560
well pst for me oh it's like 15 minutes so it's yeah so for
est that is at 3 15.

1100
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:31,440
your pst okay yeah i'm pst oh you're in california no i'm
canadian what the where like british columbia oh that's the

1101
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:43,060
secret that's the secret i'm somewhere in canada yeah oh
okay i didn't know you're canadian i thought you were uh oh

1102
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:57,760
yeah yeah my american my very american accent i mean it's
like i yeah i'm very american coded i know yeah the the

1103
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:10,320
quebec was yeah yeah no i'm not i'm not from there i'm not
from the east side of canada i see uh my family loves canada

1104
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,680
they've been traveling there a lot i have never been to
canada though they always love me because it's like long

1105
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:25,320
travel and i was too young oh wait they still don't do they
still travel there no not anymore uh i mean it's pretty cat

1106
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:34,240
canna's very nice it's like very lots of nature stuff
basically i think that yeah yeah it's similar to norway i

1107
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,620
mean every norway country is kind of cool i mean it isn't
like norway is like one of the happiest countries in the

1108
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:47,060
world or are they depressed because it's always snowing i
don't remember yeah but they also take incredible amounts of

1109
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:56,460
snooze so i would also be happy when i was there not that i
take it but i'm just saying they have infinite amount of

1110
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:05,920
drugs there so i don't know if that accounts that makes them
happier maybe i don't know i don't know if they they write

1111
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,660
that off in the stats i don't know That's crazy.

1112
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,280
I wonder if it's like cheaper.

1113
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,380
That's crazy.

1114
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,460
There's a...

1115
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,420
They're just so happy because they're just fully drugged up.

1116
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,160
Like...

1117
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,640
There's the... It's not a correlation.

1118
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,860
Okay, I have confirmation.

1119
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,660
Apparently it's not true what I said.

1120
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,300
No, no, it's not Norway.

1121
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,820
Wait, then which country is it?

1122
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,220
Oh, it's like Netherlands, right?

1123
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,980
It's Denmark.

1124
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:40,900
Oh, it's Denmark.

1125
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,020
Yeah.

1126
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,460
I feel like Denmark would be very stoic though, aren't they?

1127
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,660
The Danish?

1128
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,080
I don't know.

1129
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,500
They're weird.

1130
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,200
They have incredibly tall guys there.

1131
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,680
I know they're all super tall and they all take snooze.

1132
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,720
Is that what it's called?

1133
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,320
I think so.

1134
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,560
What the fuck is snooze?

1135
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,160
Oh, it's popular.

1136
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:15,680
in Scandinavia and it's less harmful than I thought.

1137
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:18,940
Yeah.

1138
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,220
He's like, I'm good.

1139
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,520
Oh, it's called Zin.

1140
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,220
What the fuck?

1141
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,680
I don't know.

1142
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,220
I think it's just a lot when there's just so many different
types.

1143
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,340
Oh.

1144
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,840
Man, it was all about that, Zin.

1145
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:48,020
i'm like learning i'm like what the is then i'm learning so
much is it just like you know you know what zen is what is

1146
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:57,300
it sure you know zen it's the nicotine pouches oh put it in
your lips no i mean is it health it's healthier than smoking

1147
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:08,540
right i mean it's still like nicotine though it's still
nicotine yesterday you know uh thing you can act uh oh no

1148
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:19,200
wait what's it called oh no i mean regardless it's it's not
healthy but it's healthy you're a question probably it's so

1149
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:27,480
bad it's less bad sorry that should rephrase this it's less
bad than smoking is it i don't know anything about this i

1150
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:41,060
don't smoke you wait you can get mouth cans cancer from it
still no we gotta wait for every oh it's more concentrated

1151
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:55,420
oh it'll take a while oh every matter can it's actually
pretty bad definitely not there is way to over overload just

1152
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:06,760
do you want lung cancer or mouth cancer bro that's crazy i
was just thinking like i mean if it's a patch because

1153
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:13,800
usually like those who are like addicted to the smoking they
get nicotine patches oh who which team did they verse

1154
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:25,790
because if they burst a hard i need kukui asylum blaze um
it's just ranked players oh like eu ranked players or na

1155
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:30,750
ranked players and they and they ah yeah i don't recognize

1156
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,780
It's okay.

1157
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,320
Everyone gets one loss.

1158
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:50,400
That means that means their team gets to fight Easier teams
now you want to lose early so you fight easier teams Yep,

1159
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,440
but it's probably a via contact issue my mic.

1160
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:53,980
I'm back.

1161
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,480
Muzo is playing as well.

1162
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,780
Trust me Muzo's what?

1163
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:09,200
He's playing as well with which players is with Knazin bro
Oh man Muzo they lost

1164
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:22,600
they and Imperator's team are 1-1 right now oh it's 1-1 I
think so it's tiebreaker did they lose I don't know yeah

1165
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,420
it's 1-1 you're right I thought I saw 1-1 I saw a lot of
like oh you're right you're right I saw a lot of Overwatch

1166
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:37,480
ring players in this tournament too yeah they play because
they they're not pros in this game yeah makes sense they

1167
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:46,460
have like the game sense a name I also have the name yeah
let's pick apart and we also thought about picking up some

1168
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,860
horse players back then

1169
00:57:52,060 --> 00:58:00,820
oh if you stand back early you get easier games I mean
that's how it goes but then you don't really want to risk it

1170
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:06,260
because you don't know if you're like you know it's all RNG
to who you match up with it's like MRC like some teams

1171
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:16,300
gotten easier some teams got easier into top 16 for mrc or
mri because of the the group state the matchups and stuff

1172
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:25,440
like oh my god it's really it's like will you get good rng
for your matchup because like some of the best like at one

1173
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:36,760
point yeah like like at one point like i remember for this
year's mrc uh some of the two someone like one of the top 10

1174
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,420
teams got matched up And then it fucked them over.

1175
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,200
And they got knocked out.

1176
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,420
Because they got matched up to the best teams.

1177
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,100
Like twice.

1178
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,910
Yeah.

1179
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:49,490
So it's like.

1180
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,510
It's either.

1181
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:51,630
So it's like RNG.

1182
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,910
If you're going to get a freebie team.

1183
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,090
Or a hard team.

1184
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,980
I live in Scandinavia.

1185
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:00,480

Guys.

1195
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:23,400
Guys, I was just asking a question to be more knowledgeable
of the subject, which is very different from anything, from

1196
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,120
endorsing anything.

1197
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,340

It was for educational purposes as a new region I can
confirm.

1201
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
I didn't, no, no, no.

1202
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,220
I said, oh, is it?

1203
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:50,360
healthier than smoking i i phrased it in a questioning tone
if

1204
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:03,620
it was it was a it was a question not not a statement

1205
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:15,260
hello already bought 600 patches thanks toky thanks for the
recommendation

1206
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:31,110
oh yeah i'm just oh my gosh okay i want i'll talk about this
on the zombie thing but like so many of my tweets and

1207
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:40,730
comments are going like out of um like what's it called out
of the community oh breaching what's it called when like

1208
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:47,090
stuff goes out out of the uh circle uh what's it called

1209
01:00:52,290 --> 01:01:01,950
no like when it goes outside of your circle is it that's
that was called reaching containment or going outside of my

1210
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:10,430
circle should be on the thing it's on the website but it's
not really a bracket because but i made a joke tweet about

1211
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:16,990
you know how i always tweet about like i don't see it's not
a joke like you know the office joke and i always make that

1212
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:25,170
joke every time because i just think it's funny and then um
so i made that for hightail uh yeah i left left my target

1213
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:32,590
audience yeah yeah yeah it left my target audience and i got
so many people angry at me being like just because you're a

1214
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:40,470
streamer you think you deserve special treatment or like um
what if someone used to had dokeybird before i think you

1215
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:46,690
took their name and i was like i will let you guys know
dokeybird was not like a thing like nope no one took

1216
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:57,710
dokeybird that's why i am dokey bird literally like when i
made dokey bird um like no one ever had the name dokey bird

1217
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:08,550
before and that's why i was able to use dokey bird and it
was only and then it was like a free for uh because you

1218
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:13,730
don't have to trade resources and you can't just but then it
was crazy people were like um just because she did a

1219
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:21,270
trademark it has she has no claim to dokey bird so anyone
could And it's like, if if Hytale gives her, gives her

1220
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:28,850
dokeybird, then that game is dead to me in my eyes because
then they should give special treatment to everybody, not

1221
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,430
stream, just streamers.

1222
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,250
And I'm just like, what the?

1223
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:44,290
I was just trying to make a ha ha ha funny tweet.

1224
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,270
Like I was just referencing the office.

1225
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:56,610
I was just like, I'm just making an office reference.

1226
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,610
I think it's office.

1227
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,270
It's office too retro now.

1228
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,350
Is the office old school?

1229
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:08,610
No, no one can recognize an office reference.

1230
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:09,670
Of course.

1231
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:13,670
No drama from.

1232
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:14,910
It's crazy.

1233
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:24,450
just like probably been a wolf maybe yeah that that will be
a ben i can agree with oh my god i was just like what the

1234
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:33,170
fuck is going on no but think about the opportunities make
it you're thinking different the office is officially of his

1235
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:40,190
status our video yeah i think twitter honestly oh my god
this venom i can't honestly the worst part is that i will

1236
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:47,810
agree twitter is like meeting the so negative now like
anytime you try to make a funny twitter comment or like a 20

1237
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:58,350
funny tweet like people uh please people would like uh just
go insane i'd like just go like like just find something

1238
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:07,710
wrong with something because i was like i did not expect
people to be like so mad about the hightail tweet and also

1239
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:13,950
when i was like hey guys i want some fps gaming suggestions
because like i want to play more fps games again because

1240
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:18,450
like um you know i do love shooter games but haven't been
really playing because there hasn't been a really good

1241
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:28,350
recent releases and people took that tweet yeah and like
twisted it so out of context and shit and mean like oh like

1242
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:36,670
oh numbers and shit like that i was just like no i just
realized like you know i do miss shooters and like i

1243
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:44,190
realized like you know that was what i started with and
people were like literally twisting my words for the fucking

1244
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:50,890
uh the the for that tweet because i all i was trying to say
is like hey guys can you suggest me some games because i

1245
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,510
know that hit game is arc raiders and i just don't i can't
fucking with arc raiders because like it just doesn't click

1246
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:06,310
with me because i'm not an extraction shooter player so like
i just want more suggestions and then and the people twisted

1247
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:11,010
that i mean and shit i'm like it's just all engagement
baiting

1248
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:29,640
yeah it's oh so you just hit all video game you should suck
it up and just play art creators god they're like just

1249
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:37,780
because you're not good at art you're just bad at shooters
that's why i'm like i just gotta take forever suggestions

1250
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:52,720
you're just opposing you're just everyone always ask me i've
seen so many people from your stream snake come to me and

game i would of course say i'm better but i just i have to

1253
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:16,240

was just like like just because you were a streamer you

1254
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:22,560

you want to get better i'm just making an office reference i

engagement rage bait commoners and the AI for the bots is

1261
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:02,200
pretty well trained But it's like people who don't have
enough real problems and they give the super chat.

It was crazy though.

1267
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:23,340
I was not expecting I was not i was not expecting like the
backlash of that tweet in general that's what it has like

1268
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:38,360
almost a million views and i'm like it's like a viper v3 is
the office truly retro now no i can't make the office jokes

1269
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:50,120
no boy it's now oak status oh i don't let it get no i don't

01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:56,880
funny pretty good but yeah i'm using that one the new one
from logitech obviously we're sponsored so i need to use

1271
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:08,880
logitech here the g pro too um i switched between the super
light two and i switched between the the new one i don't

1272
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:17,940
know what's the super light strike I think it's called oh is
it ergo or is it just uh it's it's mechanical like there's

1273
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:31,080
no click I meant like is it like a right-handed mouse or is
it like for both hands yeah you have day stream open the

1274
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:38,920
enemy team comp is crazy they don't like triple tank rogue
time for day

1275
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:57,840
yeah i mean i don't know i don't think this matchup is good
cringe alarm on storm wait are you watching are you watching

1276
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:06,040
the day game it looks like a full health angle to me i can't
deny that i can't believe days 14 spider-man triple thanks

1277
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:14,120
so there's no chance this comp is winning this is hard
losing yeah i'm just listening to their conversation i'm

1278
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:19,940
like a little fly on the wall they has to put on the perform
the only way to make this winning is days only kills anyway

1279
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:30,260
wait i forgot that's such an unbelievable step wait guys we
got it i forgot they included a very important update i just

1280
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:37,040
realized bro i love spider-man i swear i want to learn that
hero more that hero is so i think it's the i think it's the

1281
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:43,300
funnest character to play in the game it is the most fun
character right next to dead level i think wait where is it

1282
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,700
that is what i Emma's just dead.

1283
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:46,720
How do you get there?

1284
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,800
Or like, he should have died, right?

1285
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,080
Where's the club?

1286
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,960
I don't know how to get to the club.

1287
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,060
Charles, I need directions.

1288
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,020
Where's the club at?

1289
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,380
He just creates an entry pick like that.

1290
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,600
Just because Spider-Man is just so impressive.

1291
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,960
Where the fuck is the club?

1292
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,920
He is so strong.

1293
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,740
Oh, there it is.

1294
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,520
There it is.

1295
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,020

I'm sad.

1301
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,540
I thought I could...

1302
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:51,820
I thought I could twerk.

1303
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,540
I thought I could twerk.

1304
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,020
Oh, that's...

1305
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,120
What's the point if I can't twerk though?

1306
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,140
What's...

1307
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,540
Guys, I think I have to shut down Club Doki.

1308
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,040
He can't...

1309
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,720
No cake here.

1310
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,680
Oh, see, that is what I mean.

1311
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,300
The heroes will be.

1312
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,420
I hope I don't get DMCA the last time when they did the
anniversary stuff.

1313
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,160
I heard like Ultron looks so slay when you look at him.

1314
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1315
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,300
I'll tell you guys.

1316
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,740
Now the real question is, you know, Snakes.

1317
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,480
Who's the better Venom?

1318
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,280
You or Andrew?

1319
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,260
This is this dance.

1320
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,720
I'm not touching that with a...

1321
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,380
I'm trying to remember which dance it was.

1322
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,640
That was like super...

1323
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,540
You were afraid to answer.

1324
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,020
Is it this one?

1325
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,700
Oh, yeah.

1326
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,320
Go Ultra!

1327
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,060
Go Ultra!

1328
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,200
Go Ultra!

1329
01:11:58,960 --> 01:11:59,280
Go Ultra!

1330
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:00,400
Go!

1331
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:00,480
Go!

1332
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:03,940
Slay, girl!

1333
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:05,180
Slay!

1334
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,480
Like, I think your macro is way better than mine, obviously.

1335
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,480
Like, yeah.

1336
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,460
Oh, I mean, Andrew.

1337
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,120
I don't mean me.

1338
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:11,940
I mean, obviously.

1339
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:12,460
You're better.

1340
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,060
Come on.

1341
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,020
I go off, Cleen!

1342
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,240
I never won in this game.

1343
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,580
Go off!

1344
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,440
He's got the waist, I don't.

1345
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,920
I've only seen your venom in actual pro matches.

1346
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,200
Yeah, it's true.

1347
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,440
Like, yeah, I just think your macro is...

1348
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,100
You won.

1349
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,360
Not gonna lie, he got the game.

1350
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,320
I don't have that many hours on it on the account, but I
have infinite hours and streams, right?

1351
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:39,280
I mean, we stream three hours a day, six hours a day.

1352
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,580
Just two hours a day.

1353
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,700
At least three hours of that is venom.

1354
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:49,260
You can see the hours in the career that you see in the
game.

1355
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,000
He has the waist though.

1356
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,940
He really does.

1357
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,220
Oh, they are not happy.

1358
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,540
He has the waist.

1359
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,600
The vibe's so off.

1360
01:12:59,060 --> 01:12:59,920
Show me the stats day.

1361
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,200
What else?

1362
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,360
What else?

1363
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,900
It would be good.

1364
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:08,820
I mean, like, oh, maybe what does Punisher look like with
the swimsuit?

1365
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,140
Oh, you can't see shades of gray.

1366
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:31,240
he knows what he has he is let's go i mean do they know the
penny team up is not existing anymore they're so good man

1367
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:41,880
look at look at punisher go yeah i think so probably oh my
god the disrespect is also crazy wait day's team is just

1368
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:52,230
cooked no zero pros that is so crazy oh my god look at
rocket oh my god the hip slap on rocket though

1369
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:03,600
everyone is always so ruthless all right let's oh magneto
you want to see magneto i don't know what skin oh i have

1370
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,420
default skin

1371
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,340
you're so mad she still got this

1372
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:24,420
also play against this old man still got this gold old man
go because you get worse opponents next all right oh i do

1373
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:33,100
not have any magneto skins you you fight against yeah but
think about it in that way eventually you're gonna win when

1374
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:42,260
you would lose you know so that would i think the i think
the luna one is the best for sure you know what i mean i

1375
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,800
explained it bad but i think the luna best dancer ever.

1376
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,300
I wish you could, but I honestly wish you could.

1377
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,380
Oh my god, look at Oh my god, bro.

1378
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,840
Oh my god, wait.

1379
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,280
And the team that loses at 5 wins, this actually
accentuates.

1380
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,020
Oh my god.

1381
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,160
Look at, okay, but look at Torch.

1382
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,700
Look at... The only difference is when you lose in the first
round, look at Torch though.

1383
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,420
He's got the legs for it for sure.

1384
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,240
He's got... You see that?

1385
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,880
He's got the legs for it.

1386
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,680
There's no...

1387
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,980
Oh my...

1388
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,240
No!

1389
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,180
It can also be unfair though.

1390
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:24,540
Like in Overwatch and Xamarin, there are a lot of cases in
Open Division where you would just like have a...

1391
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,760
Like bad teams could face bad teams even at seven wins.

1392
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,680
Wait, how do I...

1393
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:28,960
Can I...

1394
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,060
No!

1395
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,060
I can't do this as hard!

1396
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:33,640
What's the point?

1397
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,580
Wait, oh wait, you can't!

1398
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,140
You can face a team that Terra beat.

1399
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:43,220
So it can be very two strong teams to face when there's
infinite other teams to face who are just on paper wars.

1400
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:43,500
Yeah!

1401
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,600
That's just the system how it is.

1402
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:51,140
it it's on average though it gives you let's go get it
bruised okay like it's the first system

1403
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:03,640
all right let's see where it's double elimination and you in
the group with or like in the first two slots with teams

1404
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:10,060
that are very high seated or very good all right well dance
well dance while i use the back throw up your back i gotta

1405
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,940
do another nervous p up your back need to get better

1406
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:47,800
oh they're arguing oh it is bad are you watching are you
watching day trust me yeah it's also not worth to like over

1407
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:53,900
like i'm sorry to say but it's not that super much money of
course there's money on the line and like reputation more

1408
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,240
than money in this kind of tournament but there's so many
teams

1409
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:01,580
too early on.

1410
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,820
I mean, I can see his points, but at the same time, I can
also see the other's points.

1411
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:11,700
You know?

1412
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,320
Imperators and idiots?

1413
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,580
Nah, don't say that.

1414
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:25,060
It's just a classic moment of everyone being super
individual and everyone wants to be that guy, you know?

1415
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:26,640
Snobble.

1416
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,900
You got both cloak and dagger.

1417
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,120
But even in pro play, we always argue with each other too.

1418
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:44,040
like all a job to do i want back i wish i wish we could do
our own wait wait i could twerk up here right there's his

1419
01:17:44,040 --> 01:18:00,800

01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,740

01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,140
Wait, I got cheek up with him.

1423
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,160
Cheek by cheek.

1424
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,940
Yeah, cheek to cheek.

1425
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:18,680
Let's go.

1426
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:23,480
Yeah.

1427
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,700
Oh my god, what the...

1428
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:28,560
I have Coach Kofi.

1429
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,540
I can't, Krook.

1430
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,440
Oh my god.

1431
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,840
Jeff, Jeff, the lead singer.

1432
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:34,840
Luna, the DJ.

1433
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,500
I don't know.

1434
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:47,800
i'm telling you starlord the backup dancer and then the
venom the backup backup dancer like we eating goods and that

1435
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,080
crooks defen but that's funny what is the funny

1436
01:18:54,420 --> 01:19:01,220
this is the most joy you'll see from me today chat is there
a reason why he's everywhere so should we should we leave

1437
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:08,660
day spider-man open that should we leave what funny we can't
even play them actually

1438
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:24,120
exactly but back then you could also play teams that lost my
favorite part of the stream the one the one thing that gives

1439
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:34,980
me the most joy and life so if you like six old and like
let's say there's four teams who are still people playing

1440
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:42,080
who have fuck is still playing cannot play each other so
they have to play like one division below them so that can

1441
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:51,560
that can happen if it's like uneven other than that like
it's like it's only 94 completed oh my i only like 10

1442
01:19:51,560 --> 01:20:00,640
minutes late and we are just to face down because like
infinite teams playing this game no like this this game no

1443
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:08,520
my venom like i wonder how long they left me yeah waiting
for every team to finish playing

1444
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:25,340
they left me what's oh my god wait we have our own personal
dancer here wait give me a sec good look oh that's my i

1445
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:30,800
can't have everyone compliment me i think it was in this
yeah so comfy i can only recommend it today

1446
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,740
Bill, I can't play in that.

1447
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,020
Guys, I'm in my own personal showroom now.

1448
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,420
Yeah, I live in the basement right now, so it's very safe.

1449
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,100
I don't live there, but I will play here.

1450
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,400
This is a good, a good break.

1451
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,600
It has sleeves too, right?

1452
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,740
Very comfy and cozy.

1453
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,220
Yeah, like, uh...

1454
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,600
The VIP lounge, exactly.

1455
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:58,500
Oh, really?

1456
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,500
My people.

1457
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,540
But actually, I'm gonna go get more cop dress.

1458
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,140
I'll be right back, guys.

1459
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,180
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1460
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,120
I'm gonna get the cop jobs real quick and we're wider.

1461
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:33,930
He also wanted that pool.

1462
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:34,850
I'm onto something.

1463
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,890
I'm telling you guys that.

1464
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,970
I've always been a heavy hitter.

1465
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:12,110
I mean, I don't want to destroy his delusion, but I don't
think they did that well, to be honest, last game.

1466
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:15,490
But I don't think anyone in this team did well, besides
that.

1467
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,370
If you really break it down, what happened in that game?

1468
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:26,230
Otherwise, you don't get full health, especially not in this
kind of like competition the enemy isn't fully responsive to

1469
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:37,670
every perfect play you can set up if one guy makes one good
play it's very hard to stop it yeah i mean a lot of people

1470
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:42,730
will drama farm i don't know if that's the case right now
though i think this is a very common misconception on losing

1471
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:53,170
the very first game that you play it's okay yeah i think
they're also similar level those

1472
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,500
people are not snake we know

1473
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:17,420
snake is just yearning for the day the venom spider-man
t-lovers coming back he's waiting he's so hungry for that

1474
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,870

01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:52,340
if I'm if I'm never hiding it this game was made for me
there we go I'm also I'm also slouching out my chair just

1506
01:25:52,340 --> 01:26:01,840
like invisible women right now sadly the make it rain was a
battle pass and I could I didn't buy the battle pass

1507
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,780
unfortunately but this is the second best thing

1508
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:18,990
that clapping sound that's me appreciating the fine arts
i've always been a heavy hitter uh an artist crafted that

1509
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:28,770
ass himself molded with love that twerky moat was animated
by a person with love

1510
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,360
that's right

1511
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:43,670

full-time spider-man they mmo capped it Maybe for the
dances.

1515
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:17,750
Honestly, I will not be surprised if this was motion
captured.

1516
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:20,650
That's nice animation right there.

1517
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,210
I'm here to appreciate...

1518
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,250
I love animation.

1519
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:29,990

1608
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,560
Oh my god.

1609
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:20,360

That's crazy.

1615
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,880
Right off the bat we get a hard team.

1616
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,820
Yeah, bad RNG.

1617
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:39,660
Yeah, it's better having him on Wolf than on Heather, I'm
gonna be honest.

Ah!

1625
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,460
I don't think we banned Wolf.

1626
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,920
If anything, we banned Phoenix to get rid of the Wolf team
up.

1627
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:54,440
All right.

1628
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,300
Everyone.

1629
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:56,900
All right.

1630
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:59,060
There we go.

1631
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:00,540
That's two bans.

1632
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:01,960
Oh my God.

1633
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:02,880
Really?

1634
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:06,740
Right off the bat, we get the try hard team.

1635
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:10,000
Second, there's 600 teams.

1636
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:25,180
teams there's 600 teams in round two oh my god against the
gator that's crazy or some would call that's crazy rng what

1637
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:41,560
the hell i guess lives in that's insane i mean that's not
really that low 600 teams and you know what i get cook Usaya

1638
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:53,660
seed I legit have no clue let's check oh my god I gotta
check in I almost forgot oh my god out of 600 I know and

1639
01:39:53,660 --> 01:40:01,520
like half 300 teams have doesn't show the ceiling the thing
is 300 teams have the one oh and the fact that our second

1640
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:09,020
match is against this team no it's it's Swiss format

1641
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:25,420
that's the price i got too greedy i got too greedy in the
club i got too fucking greedy in the club guys god has

1642
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:37,620
punished me how's this fox guy a lot to play by the way when
he's top on mrc he's just a coach apparently so he's fat

1643
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:42,640
yeah so it's fine as long like coaches are fine but not
substitutes Hmm.

1644
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:45,180
Interesting.

1645
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:51,040
So you just bring the full MRC roster then.

1646
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,400
And who's this FE guy?

1647
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,260
That's Iron.

1648
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:58,420
He's from Overwatch.

1649
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,660
I know him.

1650
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:01,020
Yeah.

1651
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,040
He doesn't play this Iron Age.

1652
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:05,600
He's a...

1653
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,880
No, that's not Iron Age.

1654
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:11,180
There's a tank player from Overwatch that plays Diva.

1655
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:13,500
That's it.

1656
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:14,460
Mm-hmm.

1657
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:24,660
for who's lower seed i don't know oh it doesn't show
anywhere oh my god i messed up stand my biblical greed comes

1658
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:34,480
for biblical punishment let's see trust the process we are
seed 577 so we're definitely not first seed what is this

1659
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:42,020
team called race car 577 no it's no it's the same seed for
them

1660
01:41:46,440 --> 01:42:02,120
see 277 okay let's see the 296 so i guess the highest seed
577 out of 606 teams guys that we're never gonna be the

1661
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,130
highest seed

1662
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:13,420
oh the god punished me for all the cake i received

1663
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:21,280
Oh, he really did punish me.

1664

oh my like what are these matchups or is my RNG face the
diamond case navi arm sleeve it's time to put it on for this

1680
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:55,770
match you feel comfortable in the arm sleeve what do you
feel comfortable in the arm sleeve yeah very sure it's like

1681
01:43:55,770 --> 01:44:06,590
the opposite i always go in all right let's go into bands oh
okay i'm locked in locked in

1682
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:19,500
which hero do you think you want to beat him i forgot what
these guys save i'm bending gambit for sure they're gonna

1683
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:29,200
play angela probably and wolf yeah gator on yeah gator
angela is really good It's kind of handless of Angela.

1684
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:34,020
I think it's possible that we pause too if my mic should not
work at one point.

1685
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:35,340
Okay.

1686
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,160
Yeah, so remember to do that as well.

1687
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,300
I'm banning, I'm saving Invis because you know what, Angela.

1688
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,580
Which heroes will get my cosmic favor today?

1689
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,200
Yeah, I think so.

1690
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:53,200
He's the Gators, yeah, he's the Overwatch League guy and
also the coach of Envy.

1691
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,940
It's also a good map for Wolf, to be honest too.

1692
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:55,880
So it's like...

1693
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:08,440
or so i can go angela giving mantis yeah you can maybe play
triple if they don't burn it yeah i think they're really

1694
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:16,420
good they're analyzing this is meant to take all supports
with cloak i think we do that and they go raccoon mantis and

1695
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:26,820
they're safe yeah take mantis i think and so i'm banning now
questions mantis and phoenix yeah i think mantis phoenix is

1696
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:33,760
good ban yeah i don't mind playing into loki i think snake
can play into loki quite well i want to play mantis in

1697
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:42,280
mantis in this to be honest for us and that it's good into
loki they have to ban venom most likely we can always go

1698
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:50,220
phoenix i'm just it doesn't work uh bakuna means and ban
phoenix yeah it's just v ban yeah yeah nothing has to do

1699
01:45:50,220 --> 01:46:01,740
you're theorizing i think it's i'm gonna do it i don't think
it's that scary we have we have uh venom i think venom is

1700
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:12,560
pretty good into it oh i can always go back and just control
the phoenix yeah yeah if they're studying anyone they're not

1701
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:22,480
studying maybe angela yeah angela bad is not too bad if
they're trying to study someone it's not me guys i'm the

1702
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:33,840
mascot i think diversity higher i would feel it's a name or
ban not hella i think just hella actually hella is maybe

1703
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:40,420
better you're right i i i think a hella ban it's not bad
hella because that guy's you could have also been mech but

1704
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:49,120
it's it leads to the same thing yeah i think mech is not as
scary very calculable with damage save venom is it venom it

1705
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:57,920
looks good no the bucky loki in this yeah but it's our best
uh opportunity i think it's a good creator for they don't

1706
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:03,860
need to analyze me to know how to kill me i'm literally a
headless like he knows when to go out he knows his limits

1707
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:11,520
it's not bad snake is pretty good oh there's tournament only
in tournament mode it's like maybe a band cap okay man we

1708
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:21,280
play in this mantis rock and burn this is not good man i'm
not judging we need to play luna in this oh i'm not the type

1709
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:29,560
who fades quietly into the background are they beyond
questions do i go deadpool or do i go mac we should star

1710
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:38,280
phoenix or star hella i mean phoenix cellar it's a
domination map i kind of want a deadpool i mean you can try

1711
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:46,600

like first map's gonna be a bit cooked but yeah beyond the

1712
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:55,480
angela map yeah be careful i'll try i don't want me to play
you the more i can actually because i don't know what's up

1713
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:02,500
okay okay they're gonna be diving yeah yeah because like
last map was last round we were split up i actually think

1714
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:10,820
they're gonna go Groot if they do then we need to thank if
they play you need to play uh above them no i didn't say i

1845
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:03,960
I think so.

1846
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:04,680
I think we walk.

1847
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:07,680
I think we walk.

1848
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:08,580
It should be enough time.

1849
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:09,140
Oh wait.

1850
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,260
The angel that sees me.

1851
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:10,720
Wait.

1852
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1853
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:12,960
I can walk.

1854
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,960
I have a touch.

1855
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:16,480
Can you touch?

1856
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,360
Ange is deeply.

1857
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,360
One, one, one, one.

1858
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,000
Angela, I alter.

1859
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,200

1860
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:47,520

it's fine believe i'm telling you if i go anything else here

1861
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:48,460
It will not be easier.

1862
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,120
You just need to cycle it better.

1863
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:51,100
I really think that.

1864
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:52,120
Matchup is good.

1865
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,340
I think the matchup is good.

1866
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,280
I think I'm going to go Bucky.

1867
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,360
Bucky just farms us really hard.

1868
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:59,200
Yeah, but if I go Emma, he will farm more.

1869
01:52:59,380 --> 01:52:59,580
Trust.

1870
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,060
Really, really believe that.

1871
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,820
I need you to believe that.

1872
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,740
I'm going to go Bucky then.

1873
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:05,920
I literally can't go Emma here.

1874
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:07,440
I'll just not make any progress.

1875
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,660
That's what I'm saying.

1876
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:11,540
I'm trying to lock in.

1877
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:12,900
Do I go Bucky?

1878
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:14,720
No, he is really good at Angela.

1879
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:15,480
No, no, no.

1880
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:15,960
Venom is fine.

1881
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:16,960
I really think that.

1882
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,140
It's just very hard to...

1883
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:20,800
He knows how to dodge shit.

1884
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:24,200
We had good moments.

1885
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,160
We just need to pressure a bit more in the neutral.

1886
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:27,960
We need to set up more.

1887
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:28,740
Now we don't.

1888
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:30,100
Now we just play in neutral in the main.

1889
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:30,820
It's fine.

1890
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,100
But I do think...

1891
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,900
We're never gonna have enough room to back into that.

1892
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,100
But why not?

1893
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,980
We have insane resources.

1894
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:40,060
We just don't have Ulster vibe then.

1895
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,100
Ulster vibe then.

1896
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,960
But we have good Ulster vibe.

1897
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:46,620
We have really good combos.

1898
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:47,500
We have Phoenix.

Looking at Loki.

1907
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:21,000
No lambs.

1908
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,280
I pushed someone out.

1909
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:24,240
I'm ready to push.

1910
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:25,680

Good, good, good.

01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:30,320
No more, no more, no more.

01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:32,360
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

Nice one, my one.

1924
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,200
She needed some help.

1925
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:39,760
Good points.

1926
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:40,920
Okay, chill now, chill now.

Just don't use it too early, okay.

1934
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:51,240
They're too deep.

1935
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:52,280
Save it for.

1936
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:52,900

Go in, go in.

1953
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:11,460
I'm landing in back lane.

1955

01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:49,120
You can't really do a peek.

2026
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:50,160
Come top, come top.

2027
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:50,460
I'll go.

2028
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:51,340
I need flank from behind.

2029
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:52,460
They can't do anything.

2030
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,700
Flank from behind, drop from behind.

2031
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:55,440
We want to backline.

2032
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:57,180
We should play from main, okay.

2033
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:57,820
When they walk up.

2034
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:58,160
Okay, okay.

2035
01:57:59,040 --> 01:57:59,620
Don't make sounds.

2036
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:01,020
They go left side and now they main them in.

2037
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,100
When are they going?

2038
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:03,460
When are they going?

2039
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,380
They're still sitting.

2040
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,360
Can we go into them?

2041
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:08,140
Three, two, one.

2042
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:08,700
Laughing.

2043
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,360
They walked us up here.

2044
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:11,840
Oh, one, one, one.

2045
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:12,700
No link.

2046
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:13,400
I can go deep.

2047
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:13,900
I can already.

2048
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:14,740
I need to go.

2049
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:15,960
Yeah, we can go.

2050
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:17,400
I couldn't.

2051
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,540
I'll push him back then.

2052
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,400
You have to do.

2053
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:22,280
No, we don't.

2054
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:24,080
We have to do here.

2055
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:24,720
I have to do here.

2056
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:24,760
Run out.

2057
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:25,340
Run out.

2058
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,980
I ult this.

2059
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:28,420
I ult this.

2060
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:29,100
Lift, lift guys.

2061
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:29,560
Let me touch.

2062
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:30,080
Let me touch.

2063
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:31,100
Oh, I didn't.

2064
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:34,360
I'm your Phoenix.

2065
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:36,880
Lift.

2066
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:37,260
Lift up.

2067
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,400
I'm shooting from behind.

2068
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,020
I'm trying to lift.

2069
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,280
They want me off.

2070
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:41,900
But I'm trying to live right now.

2071
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:42,560
No, it's fine.

2072
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:43,680
Back on, back on.

2073
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,540
I'm close to the ring.

2074
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:47,800
Live it, live it, live it, live it, live it, live it.

2075
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,040
I'm trying to live.

2076
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:50,280
I'm trying to live.

2077
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:52,680
I'm trying to live.

2078
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:52,780
I'm living, I'm living, I'm living.

2079
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:53,220
Can we touch?

2080
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:56,060
I'm one, I'm one, I need care.

2081
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:56,820
I'm trying to.

2082
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:58,200
I'm trying to.

2083
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,480
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

2084
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:01,700
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

2085
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:02,220
I just got it.

2086
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:03,520
I just got it.

2087
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:04,900
It's fine.

2088
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:05,160
It's fine.

2089
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:05,520
It's fine.

2090
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:06,120
Play slow.

2091
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:06,840

I need help, I need help.

2102
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,440
I'm pushing with you.

2103
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:56,840
I'm in this already now.

2104
01:59:58,160 --> 01:59:59,740
We only have solo invis here.

2105
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:01,500
Strange one, strange one.

2106
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:02,180
We're dead Luna.

2107
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:06,440
Angela's coming for me, Angela's coming for me.

2108
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,080
I'm dead.

2109
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:08,500
I'm dead.

2110
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:08,860
Oh.

2111
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,220
Yeah, it's fine.

2112
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,280
A lot of fights was winnable.

2113
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:17,260
It's fine.

2114
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:19,440
We got a match triple, I think.

2115
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,120
I don't think so.

2116
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:24,080
I think we had a decent enough matchup.

2117
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:26,180
Yeah, we could have won that.

2118
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:26,800
That was really close.

2119
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:27,180
Yeah, we could have won.

2120
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,260
There was too many mistakes there.

2121
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:31,100
It's okay.

2122
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:33,660
I think this was the matchup where you should go Daredevil,
though.

2123
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,660
Don't see how they defended.

2124
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:36,820
I don't think so.

2125
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:45,880
did i think so oh i couldn't see crook i didn't know where
he was i was just playing main i mean i'm telling you if i

2126
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:52,120
go emma there i don't think anything will change i think we
got to start comboing matt or venom and phoenix all that's

2127
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:58,720
just insta wipe every time we're using we're using we're
using venom law on yeah like solo and we can't even like get

2128
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:03,600
trades with the you got you got some good venom laws we
could get picks but why don't i don't know they're the pros

2129
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:13,200
yeah was unlucky the angela saw me and i was like i tried to
like i was gonna die oh the last time yeah i could have

2130
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:24,560
comboed you right the very last one i yeah i had to like
dodge the group walls everywhere like we we get picks and

2131
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:30,760
we're up but we're getting nothing off it after we're up in
fights yeah i mean we gotta develop on backhand better we

2132
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:36,440
had really good flank we need that more from you i go if you
have flake you can't just play in main and afk you need to

2133
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:43,400
take them more often so we get opportunities to hit with the
venom slam if you can only stun from front that's very bad

2134
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:52,280
for us especially if you already have a buggy you have to
develop more on the map sure we gotta start looking for my

2135
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:59,940
hooks more number one i wish i knew where he was i don't
know if i if i positioned ron or not there we gotta start we

2136
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:05,260
gotta start looking at my hooks more like there's like three
different times we're no but like we also have no one that

2137
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,320
They have Loki lamb for it.

2138
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:14,660
So the best thing we can get out of it is lamb for sure But
if I have to burn every cooldown for forcing out that that

2139
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:20,260
hook that's kind of kind of hard a lot of the times We're
still in rotation, so you even need to put them way deeper

2140
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:28,300
in the back line or we need to like you need to wait a bit
more I think Like a lot of the times we had no kill

2141
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:28,580
pressure.

2142
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:34,660
We have no one there can one shot them I also think we
should have saved the cocoon in hindsight Because it opens

2143
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:41,240
up the map way better the ult is just more pressure and luna
hold you don't think matching triple is good because when

2144
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:47,980
we're doing triple against tara's team we were doing really
well yeah but we had uh a different kind of triple we had

2145
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:55,020
mantis triple triple without mantis is kind of bad i think
what they're playing is pretty bad yeah this is the one that

2146
02:02:55,020 --> 02:03:02,680
there's like all that it was just unlucky that rng was we
got matched against one of the harder teams but it's just

2147
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:11,460
rng was it's over Like, I can't believe there's 300 teams
that are the same rank as us.

2148
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:12,620
They won one game.

2149
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:16,320
And out of 300, there's like five good teams in this
tournament.

2150
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:19,300
There's like four to five good teams in this tournament.

2151
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:22,180
And we match with one of them here.

2152
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:28,040
Like, four to five teams out of 300 teams are really good
teams.

2153
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:30,060
And this was one of them.

2154
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:34,060
It says actually crazy.

2155
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:40,000
Yeah.

2156
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:45,170
That was actually crazy.

2157
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:59,780
RNG, the monkey paw curl.

2158
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:01,920
I just had too good of a time at the club.

2159
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:06,180
I think the match itself is okay.

2160
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,040
I don't know if the hell up end is necessary though.

2161
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:11,040
It feels like a very easy carry to dive and punish.

2162
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:20,250
Another, is this, oh no, this is not a convoy.

2163
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:21,470
What is this?

2164
02:04:21,510 --> 02:04:23,370
Yeah, this is a convoy.

2165
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:27,550
I used all my love.

2166
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:38,410
on the twerking the other than other than hello you mean
okay could be in this last maybe and this is so close they

2167
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:40,750
saved it my bad then let me think

2168
02:04:43,810 --> 02:04:52,310
maybe mac i don't know maybe mac is the next best because
then they can't play cloak they can't play mac gold is a

2169
02:04:52,310 --> 02:05:02,030
problem as well the mac bubble is annoying but it wasn't
like this the carry for them so i don't think that either i

2170
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:08,130
think i mean iron does only plays mag so if you want to like
just save raccoon now in the same band theory

2171
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:18,050
crook i think it's mandatory who am i gonna banish from this
match maybe we should even think about saving it first the

2172
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:23,290
next time ben mantis ben phoenix again i think that's good

2173
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:37,200
um in tournament ban um when you're banning a character
you're banning for the enemy team so you're not banning for

2174
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:43,620
yourself so when you ban something you get to play the
character so both teams has to ban gambit so the both teams

2175
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:50,660
can't play gambit yeah if we want i don't mind that now now
we should win same with saving when you're saving a

2176
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:55,560
character you're saving for your own team so because this is
like heavy tournament yeah

2177
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:08,580
ban maybe it's different from rank but i don't know maybe
that crude is kind of yeah i will do mag burn maybe mag but

2178
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:14,280
hella is so good here though yeah or hella i lost right it
has to be hella again i think it's one of it's just too good

2179
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:27,340
on this map yeah i think save raccoon so we at least get to
have the option to play life we can still it's a ban crude

2180
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:33,600
we can still go triple with that should be still be good i
probably should think triple would be good in my opinion

2181
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:40,700
guys but um i do like when we're playing mag though the mag
phoenix combo yeah for sure

2182
02:06:46,000 --> 02:07:01,340
phoenix okay that's all right we can play hella no more here
hella no more make that in this rocket oh yeah i just oh

2183
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:09,840
crook i just need to talk someone off then yeah yeah yeah
yeah you're pretty good on deadpool yeah i can try the pool

2184
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:15,940
again i think cap's good for support although too
technically it's a triple support yeah but normally we

2185
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:22,240
should have so much map presence that we shouldn't even be
forced to cycle supporters like if they're jumping enough

2186

02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:14,300

2225
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:40,500

No problem.

2243
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:02,440
No problem.

2244
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:03,020
He's with him.

2245
02:09:03,420 --> 02:09:03,860
Nice.

2246
02:09:03,900 --> 02:09:04,280

I'm pushing Loki.

2248
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,260
No Link.

2249
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:09,300
No Link.

2250
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:09,660
No Link.

2251
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,300
I got Adam.

2252
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:12,680
I got Adam.

2253
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:12,940
I got him.

2254
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:13,300
Mag, Mag.

2255
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:13,760
Mag.

2256
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,180
I got him.

2257
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:18,700
Kill the backline, guys.

2258
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:19,660
I need care.

2259
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:20,780
Adam flies the backline.

2260
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:21,820
I'm Alting.

2261
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:23,620
Can you boop this stranger here?

2262
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:24,760
Invis outside.

2263
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:25,320
She can die.

2264
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:25,860
She's not in.

2265
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:26,680
Both of them.

2266
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:27,140
Both of them.

2267
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,080
The other Invis is far.

2268
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:29,880
I'm dropping.

2269
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,260
You got it.

2270
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,280
Push in the...

2271
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:34,000
Push in the...

2272
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:34,420
Push in the...

2273
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:34,640
Adam!

2274
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,600
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam!

2275
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,500
I'll take it, okay.

2276
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:41,280
I do not have anything.

2277
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:43,680
This is real fireball.

2278
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,920
Venom is gonna burn.

2279
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:47,920
Oh, I'm dead.

2280
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:48,380
Venom below.

2281
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:49,580
Venom one, Venom one, Venom one.

2282
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,380
They have no lands.

2283
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:51,880
Push him back, man.

2284
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:52,560
Loki one.

2285
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:53,140
I don't care.

2286
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:55,620
I'm trying to destroy your doors.

2287
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:56,520
Venom one, top right.

2288
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:57,160
Look top right.

2289
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:57,700
Look at Venom.

2290
02:09:57,860 --> 02:09:58,400
He's literally one.

2291
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:01,120
Now Adam, now Adam is at risk.

2292
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,460
Look Venom, look Venom!

2293
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:03,160
He has no E!

2294
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:04,760
I don't know about what's in this!

2295
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:06,920
Venom!

2296
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:07,860
I can't get for him.

2297
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:10,100
Need to lift, need to regroup, need to regroup.

2298
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:12,700
They're on 3-3.

2299
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:13,780
Yeah, yeah.

2300
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:15,080
You need to group up.

2301
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:16,440
Need to go next fight.

2302
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:17,280
I'm old again.

2303
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,580
I'm pushing Adam, okay?

2304
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:21,000
You need to have a neutral fight and we push Adam.

2305
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:24,520
Wait it, wait it, wait it, wait it.

2306
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:25,120
I'm back soon.

2307
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:26,240
You're welcome.

2308
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:26,920
I'm still waiting.

2309
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:29,000
Why would I need healing?

2310
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:32,400
Go inside right, go on a strange old.

2311
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:33,500
They're gonna have that in prison.

2312
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:35,900
Someone's on top right.

2313
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:38,560
We can walk with an old tier on the back line.

2314
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:39,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2315
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:40,480
Go left, go left.

2316
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:41,980
Okay, we go left.

2317
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:42,920
Okay, trust me, you're solo.

2318
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:44,420
Yeah, I know, I know.

2319
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:45,580
I go behind them.

2320
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:48,100
I mean, oh, strange is marking me.

2321
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:49,840
Oh, I'm one, I'm one.

2322
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:50,900
Oh, nobody is here.

2323
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:51,180
I'm dead.

2324
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:51,500
I'm dead here.

2325
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:51,780
I'm dead.

2326
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:52,260
I can't.

2327
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:53,060
There's no hot clap.

2328
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:55,060
Oh, we're down.

2329
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:55,880
Yeah, we're down.

2330
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:57,260
We need to group.

2331
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:57,760
We need to group.

2332
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,540
We're going to reset.

2333
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:01,460
Don't go in now.

2334
02:11:01,620 --> 02:11:02,280
Don't go in now.

2335
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:02,800
We actually...

2336
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,500
Oh, I couldn't.

2337
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:03,640
Yeah.

2338
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,520
Oh, we die.

2339
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:05,960
I couldn't live through that.

2340
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,740
I don't want, but I'm just saying.

2341
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:09,280
Go full Riku.

2342
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:09,840
Full lift.

2343
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:10,220
Full lift.

2344
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:10,660
Full lift.

2345
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:15,780
Just wait and group up.

2346
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:17,760
Luke, please stand for it, right?

2347
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:18,920
Just go on the rocks.

2348
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:21,220
Yeah, just wait.

2349
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:22,620
I'm waiting for it.

2350
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:25,120
On the rocks and the rest of us go main.

2351
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:28,520
They literally have nothing to sustain the engagement.

2352
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:34,480
Yeah, you can't show earlier.

2353
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:36,480
I should go backline.

2354
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:37,340
They're marking me.

2355
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:37,860
We're going right?

2356
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

2357
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,000
We're still walking.

2358
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:41,080
Wait, wait, wait.

2359
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:42,740
Strange is top right.

2360
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:43,500
Watch for all.

2361
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:44,400
Strange was top right.

2362
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:45,320
I'll tell you.

2363
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:46,020
Any help here?

2364
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:47,360
I got you.

2365
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:47,760
I got him.

2366
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:49,080
One, two, one.

2367
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:50,000
Might be.

2368
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:50,620
Open up.

2369
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:50,980
Come on.

2370
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:53,500
They should be okay though.

2371
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:53,760
Help Rocky.

2372
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:54,640
Look, trust me.

2373
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:55,820
Yeah, strange one.

2374
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:56,340
Strange one.

2375
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,220
Adam dies.

2376
02:11:57,740 --> 02:11:58,500
Walk, walk, walk.

2377
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:02,480
I'm touching, I'm touching, don't worry, don't worry, I'm
touching.

2378
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,660
I have my own in this one, in this one.

2379
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,960
Live, live, live, live it, live it, live it, live it.

2380
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:08,840
We almost have rocket wood.

2381
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:10,920
Get your rocket wood out of the top left here.

2382
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:11,900
I stack with you guys.

2383
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:12,380
I got a guy.

2384
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:13,900
Go use, go.

2385
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:14,160
Yeah.

2386
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:15,360
I push back line.

2387
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:16,880
I do not have bubble.

2388
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:18,000
You have to touch, you have to touch.

2389
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:18,880
No, I touch, I touch.

2390
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:19,600
I'm not.

2391
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:21,560
I'm not.

2392
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,740
Rock up, walk inside, walk inside.

2393
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:23,440
I want to end this way.

2394
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:24,380
Okay, okay, I'm here.

2395
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:26,100
I need care, I need care on top.

2396
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,820
Yeah, we got hit.

2397
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:31,540
Strange, strange.

2398
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:31,800
It's fine.

2399
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:32,960
It's a big one.

2400
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:33,220
Yeah.

2401
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:34,380
Break it up, please.

2402
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:37,000
I'm...

2403
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:37,180
Okay.

2404
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:38,860
You need to push back then.

2405
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:39,340
Have your love.

2406
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:41,700
Two, one.

2407
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:44,400
Run up, run up.

2408
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:45,000
Run up, run up.

2409
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:47,180
I'm pushing from behind.

2410
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,280
You have to touch.

2411
02:12:48,380 --> 02:12:48,780
You have to touch.

2412
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:49,880
I need to touch.

2413
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:50,220
Take his touching.

2414
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,640
I need care top.

2415
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:52,100

2416
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:52,520
I got you.

2417
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:53,240
I'm dead.

2418
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:53,980
On the top.

2419
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:54,900
I have Rez.

2420
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:57,720
Venom on our backline.

2421
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:58,300
He could die though.

2422
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:58,880
I'm dead.

2423
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:00,020
that I need.

2424
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:01,460
I got you.

2425
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:03,700
I have TP.

2426
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:04,040
I have TP.

2427
02:13:04,180 --> 02:13:05,480
I can block the heals after.

2428
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,480
Yeah, I need to live.

2429
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:07,740
Wonderful.

2430
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:08,020
Winnable.

2431
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:08,320
Winnable.

2432
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:09,860
I do not bubble.

2433
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:10,800
I do not bubble.

2434
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:11,900
I'm trying to die.

2435
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:13,660
I need help.

2436
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,040
I need help.

2437
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:14,780
One point.

2438
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:15,300
I'm going to die.

2439
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,500
I'm going to block.

2440
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:16,860
Oh.

2441
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:18,100
No.

2442
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:25,220
We need to play good heroes that can push backline because
we need to have some development on the map that walks into

2443
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:25,900
the backline.

2444
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:28,360
They have no one to deny it.

2445
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:39,680
need to walk you think Emma's better here than Magneto I
don't know it's just difficult I think like I think we have

bunker I think you should have played Luna crook and you

2447
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:58,100
should have flanked with me to open the map or at least give
me flake so I can do more on the backline before dying i

2448
02:13:58,100 --> 02:14:07,320

02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:30,580
It's here.

02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,160
I'll break them.

2454
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,220
I'll go to the right side.

2455
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,720
I think this was, yeah.

2456
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:47,720
What we have right now is fine.

2457
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:48,580
We just need a bunker under.

2458
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:49,560
They're going to take above us.

2459
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,500
I can contest it though.

2460
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:54,280
Can you keep me damage boosted, Crook?

2461
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:55,460
I farm E.

2462
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,580
We need to be very careful against Venomult.

2463
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:08,400
Don't miss your dome.

2464
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:09,360
Always use the defensive.

2465
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:10,720
Yeah, yeah.

2466
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:11,520
I don't want him dead.

2467
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:13,180
Starlords gonna spin from behind.

2468
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:13,960
I'm gonna mark him.

2469
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:15,260
I'm gonna mark him.

2470
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:17,020

2471
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:17,440
Keep me up.

2472
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:17,820
There you go.

2473
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,760
I hear it.

2474
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:20,480
I hear it.

2475
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:21,200
I hear it.

2476
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:24,180
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom,

02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:32,100
ULTRA, back LAN.

2482
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:32,960
We can walk.

2483
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Adam can die, Adam can die.

2484
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:40,160
Oh, I'm going to body blocking tock you.

2485
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:42,560
Grino, just body blocking you.

2486
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,540
He should be by him.

2487
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:47,860
I need care, I need care.

2488
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:48,820
I need to fight.

2489
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:49,860
We can win, we can win, we can win.

2490
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:51,320
We have ult here.

2491
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:52,320
I'm a ult.

2492
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,360
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

2493
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:53,880
I'm ulting.

2494
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:57,620
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna.

2495
02:15:57,620 --> 02:15:59,800
Luna, Luna, Luna.

2496
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:00,720
They're gonna have Venom off.

2497
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:01,080
They're gonna have Venom off.

2498
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:05,000
I'm blinded, I'm blinded, I'm blinded.

2499
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:07,100
I don't have mine yet, I don't mind.

2500
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:08,840
I have res, I have res.

2501
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:11,640
I'm losing, I almost have it.

2502
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:13,180
Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him, kill him.

2503
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:14,580
Kill the cellar.

2504
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,300
Venom one, Venom one, turn it low.

2505
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,560
Live, live, live, come back, come back, come back.

2506
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,600
They still have Adam res, right?

2507
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:23,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2508
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:24,680
Yeah, they do.

2509
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:27,500
Starload is on top.

2510
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:28,800
You need to live there in this world.

2511
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,420
Venom going in.

2512
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:33,100
We shoot the Venom down the street.

2513
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:34,140
Shoot the Venom at the start.

2514
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:35,280
Live, live, live, live.

2515
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:39,260
We need only a kind of ult here.

2516
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:39,820
Oh god.

2517
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:41,560
I've faded, I've faded.

2518
02:16:44,060 --> 02:16:44,780
They're dead.

2519
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:47,700
Maybe even a blue.

2520
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:48,540
I have to be black.

2521
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:49,820
I brutal.

2522
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:55,060
I TP.

2523
02:16:56,360 --> 02:16:57,300
That's one, enough time.

2524
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:58,020
That's okay.

2525
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:03,600
yeah we burned too many oils in the fight before it's kind
of sad it's okay though maybe Invis would have been better

2526
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:15,000
group but I think it was fine it's fine I think it was
another if we go any characters that can dive inside the

2527
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:20,900
room or we take behind them there's no way they can stop it
if you had given me flake I could have done that but I

2528
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:27,120
couldn't do it I think it could have faded earlier I
definitely could have faded earlier they should never kill

2529
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:36,300
you do it so fast i think we had a decent enough matchup
okay maybe rng wise rng wise maybe we have to not save in

2530
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:47,200
this first all easiest teams now all them first i think
we're getting better though all the easy teams now for sure

2531
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:56,840
i think this is a good team this was super winnable just
need to play against this team we're 50 50 on them i just

2532
02:17:56,840 --> 02:18:04,960
think like they definitely better chemistry for sure yeah
guys we were just sandbagging guys i don't know if crook

2533
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:12,740
likes me i don't think he likes me which is understandable i
am the weakest player i'm sorry i feel bad

2534
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:18,780
i feel bad

2535
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,800
No, this is the actual tournament.

2536
02:18:37,790 --> 02:18:42,070
All right, we know how to be happy, the one place.

2537
02:18:43,650 --> 02:18:45,390
No, he's just European.

2538
02:18:49,770 --> 02:18:55,590
No, he said that, he was saying that to, trust me, he was
saying that Crook, he should have played something else.

2539
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:59,730
But then everybody is like, everybody is like...

2540
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:01,930
I think he could have played Dead Evil 2, honestly.

2541
02:19:02,730 --> 02:19:03,990
There's a good matchup for it again.

2542
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:13,010
Doug does not by the way inside story Doug does not want to
play daredevil I guess every time we play daredevil we got

2543
02:19:13,010 --> 02:19:21,750
absolute shit on so Doug is like very insistent that we
should not be playing daredevil wait is this a private room

2544
02:19:21,750 --> 02:19:26,930
wait what is there also no disadvantage out of losing early
it was a good team we faced early on so we're gonna face

2545
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:36,130
easier wait oh they opened the subway can face day and
imperator if they're not out of the tournament for the Oh,

2546
02:19:36,510 --> 02:19:37,530
shit, wait, this is new.

2547
02:19:41,050 --> 02:19:42,470
I didn't know that.

2548
02:19:42,710 --> 02:19:43,310
Oh, that's cool.

2549
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:44,970
Subway's open now.

2550
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:47,490
Oh, that's how you know.

2551
02:19:47,670 --> 02:19:50,210
Oh, it's through the subway to get to the...

2552
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:51,690
To get to the disco.

2553
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:57,230
Oh my god, there's so many people dancing there.

2554
02:19:58,350 --> 02:19:59,130
Thank you for the raid.

2555
02:19:59,430 --> 02:19:59,530
Thank you.

2556
02:19:59,930 --> 02:20:00,330
Thank you.

2557
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,100
I could have played that better, even.

2558
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:08,940
I feel like...

2559
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:12,500
Or at least we kept...

2560
02:20:15,790 --> 02:20:16,900
Yeah, but that's our...

2561
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:19,250
We can only have one loss.

2562
02:20:19,470 --> 02:20:22,510
So we have to win every game here now.

2563
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:23,990
Yeah.

2564
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:26,250
That's the risky part.

2565
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:27,990
Because we already...

2566
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:30,550
We already lost our...

2567
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:31,550
We already lost our...

2568
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:32,310
Trust me, or not really.

2569
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:33,870
I think they were good.

2570
02:20:35,570 --> 02:20:37,090
I mean, I don't think they were that good.

2571
02:20:37,350 --> 02:20:38,110
They were super beatable.

2572
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:46,670
will come we just need to take around them more efficiently
like that's too much too early you try to one shot them from

2573
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:53,190
500 meter range without any hit from us you expose yourself
therefore they know where you're shooting from so cooper is

2574
02:20:53,190 --> 02:21:00,030
repositioning because he's not stupid this is already top
left marking me before like i mean then it should be value

2575
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:06,790
for us to walk up but no you definitely shot from 500 meter
range and just expose yourself early so a hit hits less hard

2576
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:13,410
it's just normal it's just how it works and then we have
timing yeah trust me you need to take it you know there's no

2577
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:18,850
downside of taking it but yeah no this is a much more
serious situation where on namer we stopped developing and

2578
02:21:18,850 --> 02:21:24,350
just kept shooting from them and we tried to turn water into
water from them into a triple tank which just doesn't work

2579
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:30,850
they have free pockets behind them so we need to take behind
them it's the only way to make a winner

2580
02:21:38,750 --> 02:21:48,390
if no dance shoes i want to dance with legit 9 hp in the
middle of point like no one shooting him where are my venom

2581
02:21:48,390 --> 02:21:58,870
oh the last map that's it i'll start the venom party he was
non-hp for so long i was like screaming i'll start my dance

2582
02:21:58,870 --> 02:22:13,870
party wait no don't worry after a venom when one venom joins
more venom will show up but i don't know this isn't yeah

2583
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:19,990
this is open to everybody i also haven't done like a super
competitive tournament a long ass time so i was like i'm

2584
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:28,670
gonna give it a shot i'm gonna give it a shot because it's
like it's like open it's like overwatch open dude and i was

2585
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:36,010
like i want to you know what i want to try that again good
team there was minimal against them Oh my god.

2586
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:37,110
Oh my god.

2587
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:38,130
Maybe he should have stayed.

2588
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:39,350
Venom in the first match.

2589
02:22:39,650 --> 02:22:40,610
He's coming over.

2590
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:42,850
Hello, my fellow Venom.

2591
02:22:43,210 --> 02:22:43,390
Hello.

2592
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:46,730
Hello.

2593
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:47,810
Hello, my fellow Venom.

2594
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:50,370
Venom combo for to kill through.

2595
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:53,630
You know, oh yeah.

2596
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:55,910
Eye to eye.

2597
02:22:55,930 --> 02:22:58,410
Yeah, it was the same thing on the first round, by the way.

2598
02:22:58,590 --> 02:22:58,850
I'll go.

2599
02:22:59,390 --> 02:23:00,190
The role play.

2600
02:23:00,490 --> 02:23:02,530
You just need to be smarter around taking behind them.

2601
02:23:03,810 --> 02:23:04,090
Yeah.

2602
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:04,930
Yeah.

2603
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:11,810
I told you all it takes is one pet venom to start the pie I
noticed I did way more when I was like behind them or like

2604
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:17,850
yeah the bogey ones definitely more relaxed this one is like
super tri-up because it's open to everybody so like the only

2605
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:24,210
restriction is that it's two pros only so you can just
literally stack your team up with top 500 players and I feel

2606
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:31,910
really bad because I asked them if I could join their team
and I feel like I am the weakest link and like I am trying

2607
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:37,750
my best though but they could have got a better player.

2608
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:41,570
So I do feel bad.

2609
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:42,890
I feel a little bad.

2610
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:58,680
And so I hope that, you know, you're not too mad at me.

2611
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:04,800
Serious Tournament proceeds to twerk.

2612
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:05,820
I don't know.

2613
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:07,460
This is my way of relaxing.

2614
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:11,100
Bring you hard on yourself.

2615
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:12,960
It's just that...

2616
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:13,840
Uh...

2617
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:22,080
I saw some of the comments that the viewers were saying
about me and I got really sad.

2618
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:25,580
I was like, I'm sorry.

2619
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,260
But it was during scrims.

2620
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:33,980
It was during scrims.

2621
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:35,840
So I was just like, I'm sorry.

2622
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:45,120
Yeah.

2623
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:04,020
Yeah, I'm trying not to...

2624
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:12,460
get it to me that's why i'm trying my best i know i'm like
making some because like i don't know if i'm ulting

2625
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:21,660
correctly though i'm like second guessing myself as well but
i asked them to micromanage me for ults because i'm worried

2626
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:29,380
that i'm not ulting correctly in like a tournament
environment um so like i hope i'm doing better

2627
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:57,640
yeah but i'm i'm i'm learning support with crude i think i'm
learning a lot i'm learning a lot though i think the madness

2628
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:05,520
was very good i mean i'm i'm learning from uh yeah i think
we have madness there i get so many like there i'm not even

2629
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:11,240
kidding there's so many instances where like people are one
hp like one more to get damage and it just changes the whole

2630
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:14,760
fight every single time Yeah.

2631
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,300
I think it was triple.

2632
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:19,880
We're not making the bad work.

2633
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:22,000
I don't think so.

2634
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:25,400
I think the dive has been working against Terra's team,
against a lot of teams.

2635
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:30,840
When we play triple against Terra, I think we did really
good.

2636
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:35,140
Yeah, I'm also fine playing triple when we have Mantis.

2637
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:39,960
I don't want to play triple without Mantis though, to be
honest.

2638
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:42,800
On the city.

2639
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:57,580
yeah and also like i'm also like not not very familiar with
tournament dive when i first play tournament dive with them

2640
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:07,760
i was getting absolutely on because like um i had no idea
how to how i've never played because like no one does

2641
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:18,480
tournament dive in rank so i was so I look like NA players
also don't know how to do any players don't play dive as

2642
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:24,780
well Any players do not play dive at all.

2643
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:34,460
It's all it's like a European cop games finish and And what
Yeah, it's scheduled at 4 30 and what time is it?

2644
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:38,200
It's 4 30 pressure imperators game like is still going.

2645
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:40,160
Oh my god.

2646
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:40,680
All right guys.

2647
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:41,800
Let's play a ranked game

2648
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:52,260
they haven't even played a game yet i'm gonna play a game
we're just gonna take a while that is stupid that is dumb

2649
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:59,740
this is a little organized just a little poorly to the point
where we have to there's so many teams to the point where

2650
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:14,240
the in-between isn't lying yeah i queue a few games so i
might as well yeah i'll play some wink I never I'm trying to

2651
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:15,500
like I'm here.

2652
02:28:15,700 --> 02:28:22,000
I know I know I just can't be a negative negative negative
person, but I'm learning now.

2653
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:30,300
I'm trying my best At least at least I'm trying my best
Yeah, that's why like the European players are hard pushing

2654
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:39,360
dive Uh, wait Yo, are hard pushing dive because to them they
play dive a lot, but and they it's so difficult

2655
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:43,860
What's up?

2656
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:58,100
oh message i don't i feel bad i don't want to talk like
because they're all like silent

2657
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:16,560
oh no who's who's doing the loud sigh oh it's doug he's not
happy

2658
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:28,780
oh chan's seeing the super chat thank you thank you i wish i
was good as you thank you thank you thank you thank you

2659
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:11,340
Can you always tell me like, how many games do you think I
can do?

2660
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:14,800
Maybe two ranked games.

2661
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:18,320
Oh, he's not here.

2662
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:25,080
Who am I going to banish from this match?

2663
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:29,120
Oh, this is my ranked team off the bat.

2664
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,580
This is my ranked team.

2665
02:30:33,880 --> 02:30:38,340
After the next game, if you want, I can run with you the
game as well to show what I mean.

2666
02:30:38,900 --> 02:30:40,100
Maybe that would also help.

2667
02:30:41,140 --> 02:30:52,840
oh i got whisper what did i get only if you want of course
we should just oh that's aggro yeah yeah that would help

2668
02:30:52,840 --> 02:31:00,480
after the next game after the next game take a break take a
break take a breather before the next game and then after

2669
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:07,300
that game we can focus on the on the what we can get a
better head foot all right bounce out of it

2670
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:20,640
Yeah, but every time we try to do D, like, Daredevil in
Scrims, we get absolutely shit on.

2671
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:23,740
And Doug was like, please, I do not want to play Dini.

2672
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:28,640
Because Dini is, I guess, Rocket.

2673
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:32,020
Oh, I'll practice Rocket more, I guess.

2674
02:31:32,140 --> 02:31:32,520
Or Cloak?

2675
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:33,880
I'll practice Cloak more.

2676
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:41,020
I do not play Cloak way often for this new season.

2677
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:44,660
All right, but if they have Mag, I'll swap.

2678
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:46,100
They'll most likely have Mag, right?

2679
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:46,740
It's GM.

2680
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:48,900
I feel like there's not a lot.

2681
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:51,080
Oh, I don't know.

2682
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:52,600
I'll swap off when...

2683
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:53,840
If they have Mag.

2684
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,060
No, I'm not...

2685
02:31:57,060 --> 02:31:58,820
I'm not on Jeff, where...

2686
02:31:58,820 --> 02:31:59,400
Most likely.

2687
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:00,060
Oh, fuck it.

2688
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:03,080
I feel like I should play Clube just to get my practice in.

2689
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,660
I feel like Rocket, I don't need as much practice in.

2690
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:09,360
But I know I'm, like, too slow on my shifts.

2691
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:14,620
Fight daggers and your soul sword.

2692
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:17,320
We can handle anything they throw our way.

2693
02:32:17,320 --> 02:32:20,380
Our foes would be wise not to underestimate us.

2694
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:21,580
Get in here, y'all.

2695
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:26,260
I'm definitely way too slow reacting for my chips.

2696
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:28,320
They're on Spider-Man.

2697
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:35,800
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

2698
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:39,400
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

Seriously.

2712
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:58,560
If there's only like 20 minutes between the games, I want to
play.

2713
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:01,360
But after the game, after the game, after the game.

02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:10,140
There's too many games.

There you go.

I was going to swap off.

2730
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:01,000
No, I got hit by the mag thingy.

2731
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:03,420
We also don't have like a Hishgan.

2732
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,460
We double ulted.

2733
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,240

2734
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:09,700
Ooh, double.

2735
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:13,700
Our cloak ulted at like before mine ended so that we can
save life.

2736
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:18,880
Oh.

2737
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:35,220

02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:25,200
there's no loser breakers no i guess there's seven I thought
it's a Swiss all the way.

2743
02:36:26,060 --> 02:36:28,310
I'm going to lose your bracket and the next stage.

2744
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,460
I'm sorry, buddy.

2745
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:32,060
Right?

2746
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:33,540
I don't know.

2747
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:35,700
It was like stages, yeah.

2748
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:38,560
The people with the most points qualified.

2749
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:46,120
I mean, losing against good teams gives you more points, I'm
pretty sure, at any sort of stage.

2750
02:36:47,880 --> 02:36:48,760
I didn't.

2751
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:48,840
I didn't.

2752
02:36:49,200 --> 02:37:15,920

missed my blind I did something I did something guys okay

fucking dead.

2754
02:37:29,570 --> 02:37:31,730
Yeah, no, we wasted a lot.

2755
02:37:31,850 --> 02:37:32,630
We have no others.

2756
02:37:32,930 --> 02:37:34,210
Yeah, no, that was bad.

2757
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:37,130
Oh, what the fuck?

2758
02:37:37,350 --> 02:37:37,670
Come on.

2759
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:38,370
I'm over here.

2760
02:37:38,390 --> 02:37:39,970
I already used my dome.

2761
02:37:42,850 --> 02:37:44,050
Guys, please someone.

2762
02:37:44,890 --> 02:37:46,410
Oh wait, I can play this now.

2763
02:37:48,450 --> 02:37:48,790
No.

2764
02:37:51,490 --> 02:37:53,830
Oh, why did he go...

2765
02:37:54,490 --> 02:37:55,090
No!

2766
02:37:56,390 --> 02:37:57,050
Yeah, please.

2767
02:37:57,390 --> 02:37:57,810
It's slippery.

2768
02:37:59,970 --> 02:38:02,370
Alright, I'll go in this.

2769
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:08,290
I don't know.

2770
02:38:08,390 --> 02:38:12,110
Our team is like, our comp is so weird, but it is ranked
though.

2771
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:17,490
Yeah.

2772
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:29,220
Alright.

2773
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:36,490
I'll put the mag closer.

2774
02:38:36,850 --> 02:38:38,050
I don't know if that's bad.

2775
02:38:40,950 --> 02:38:45,770
I leave because I know spider Spooner Man has all and I'm
worried.

2776
02:38:45,930 --> 02:38:53,170
I'm scared Get away from me Oh, there we go now.

2777
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:54,520
We just slowly move forward

2778
02:38:59,070 --> 02:39:05,410
Oh my god, we're please please please no

2779
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:19,650
My shield was God My shield was gone It's clear I'm still
needed here I fucking knew I knew that the thing is if I put

2780
02:39:19,650 --> 02:39:30,270

So that's why I got scared Are you fucking please please are

2781
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:31,510

2782
02:39:31,770 --> 02:39:36,690
He alting me out of my own alt How did that?

2783
02:39:37,050 --> 02:39:38,830
Oh my god why

2784
02:39:45,650 --> 02:39:49,730
He ulted me out of my fucking ult.

2785
02:39:50,190 --> 02:39:50,970
That's crazy.

2786
02:39:53,530 --> 02:39:55,510
I even pushed him too.

2787
02:39:56,010 --> 02:39:58,390
There's nothing I could do.

2788
02:39:58,570 --> 02:40:00,310
All right, he just doesn't want to win.

2789
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:01,590
Like we could have TP'd both times.

2790
02:40:04,530 --> 02:40:06,190
What is he talking about?

2791
02:40:07,570 --> 02:40:10,930
Okay but it's not up to one guy to TP like anybody can.

2792
02:40:10,950 --> 02:40:22,650
can tp guys like it's not a one man's job to tp guys i don't
know if they know that and also watch this the the

2793
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:40,210

2795
02:40:45,130 --> 02:40:46,390
That's all I can do.

2796
02:40:48,410 --> 02:40:49,690
That's all I can do.

2797
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:01,420
Oh, um, we are waiting for the next matchup right now.

2798
02:41:01,800 --> 02:41:02,900
Tournament's not over yet.

2799
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:04,380
It's not over.

2800
02:41:07,420 --> 02:41:08,560
Alright, let's see.

2801
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,780
Oh my god.

2802
02:41:11,740 --> 02:41:12,880
Oh my god.

2803
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:13,800
There's nothing!

2804
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,200
Nothing can protect me!

2805
02:41:15,820 --> 02:41:17,620
I had to do...

2806
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:18,660
Oh my...

2807
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:27,280
We had no shield, nothing.

2808
02:41:27,940 --> 02:41:30,260
All right.

2809
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:34,260
Wait, apparently Day's team fought someone with the top 16
coach.

2810
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:36,620
And that's the drama.

2811
02:41:38,780 --> 02:41:41,280
But didn't we fight someone with the top 16 coach as well?

2812
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:48,000
I mean, we fought not even top 16, he was signed on envy.

2813
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:51,040
Is it that against the rules, guy?

2814
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:52,460
I don't know.

2815
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:53,600
It's not against the rules.

2816
02:41:53,860 --> 02:41:55,520
As long as your coaches are fine.

2817
02:41:55,820 --> 02:41:57,540
I mean, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

2818
02:41:57,640 --> 02:41:58,400
It was also quite shit.

2819
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:00,540
But it's okay.

2820
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:02,540
It's not against the rules, though.

2821
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:03,740
Coaches are fine.

2822
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:04,540
Oh, okay, okay.

2823
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:06,140
I'm good friends with K there.

2824
02:42:06,220 --> 02:42:06,560
Just saying.

2825
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:06,980
Just saying.

2826
02:42:07,820 --> 02:42:08,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2827
02:42:09,720 --> 02:42:11,360
Not that anyone takes his two suitors.

2828
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:14,440
Okay, okay.

2829
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,700
That's what the day's drama is about.

2830
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:19,860
Or the Imperator team.

2831
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:29,180
drama I guess I don't know I mean yeah of course Imperator
is gonna farm the drug the current score is zero bad coaches

2832
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:38,600
don't get I see a zero time to switch things up including
which side you're on so what do you think we changed like

2833
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:45,940
you play triple instead instead of I think I think triple
like against really good teams I think triple is like really

2834
02:42:45,940 --> 02:42:51,500
good because we played really well against Terra's team with
triple and Terra's teams like one of the better teams you

2835
02:42:51,500 --> 02:43:01,120
know what i mean all right kirk said i should practice we
still lost but we still did the best but like i don't need

2836
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:10,060
either it is it is a situation against i will do it i don't
want to get sarah's energy right i was like i would if i

2837
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:18,920
want to win i play loki but if i want to play i play loki or
invis but kirk wants me to practice so no i don't think we

2838
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:30,140
won a map for sarah at all yeah i don't think we won against
sarah but we did we did win against energy and i don't think

2839
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:40,920
we played dive in that either let me see what's up i just
never yeah we did no it's not it is right now only because

2840
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:52,580
um only because um cloak is not meta but apparently she is
in tournament it's crazy Because rank meta is different from

2841
02:43:52,580 --> 02:43:53,280
tournament meta.

2842
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:55,720
Because no one fucking plays Cloak if they have a mag.

2843
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,980
So it's very hard.

2844
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:01,120
It's very hard to get practice on Cloak.

2845
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:05,080
Just because she's not meta in rank meta.

2846
02:44:05,540 --> 02:44:07,520
But she's meta in tournament.

2847
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:10,120
Which is...

2848
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,860
Like right now I'm wasting this.

2849
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:14,040
Because I'm used to...

2850
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:18,020
They still haven't played a game by the way.

2851
02:44:25,060 --> 02:44:25,660
Yeah I think they're...

2852
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:26,900
Java farming.

2853
02:44:26,980 --> 02:44:27,680
No, thank you.

2854
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,200
That is so stupid.

2855
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:36,720
So we wait like another out, like 40 minutes for them.

2856
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:37,860
I'm gonna go fast with my own.

2857
02:44:37,980 --> 02:44:39,060
Yeah, they should just start their game.

2858
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:42,900
Oh my god.

2859
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:44,180
Are they at a different pool than us?

2860
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:46,380
Because if so, we don't have to wait for them.

2861
02:44:46,420 --> 02:44:47,400
We're gonna go fast later and walk him back.

2862
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:47,980
Walk him back.

2863
02:44:48,060 --> 02:44:49,540
Otherwise, they're gonna get blue in the pool when I hit.

2864
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:50,760
I'll be back.

2865
02:44:57,670 --> 02:44:59,130
Oh my god.

2866
02:45:00,210 --> 02:45:02,110
Well, at least I'm mad at you, never.

2867
02:45:02,970 --> 02:45:04,730
You know, that's a good part.

2868
02:45:06,130 --> 02:45:09,110
Whoa, oh, goodbye, everybody.

2869
02:45:09,430 --> 02:45:10,850
You guys are so dead.

2870
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:14,650
Oh, they're running triple support.

2871
02:45:15,030 --> 02:45:16,490
I can never avoid that.

2872
02:45:33,820 --> 02:45:35,460
Like, what are we waiting for?

2873
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:36,760
I'm so confused.

2874
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:42,280
Oh, someone is mad right now.

2875
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:55,860
like right now i'm i'm technically wasting my i'm wasting my
um my util resources with how i'm playing the dome because

2876
02:45:55,860 --> 02:46:00,000
i'm supposed to use it more defensively but i'm not using it
very

2877
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:13,880
defensively and then i should lie more i think i yeah i
blinded people oh shit Oh.

2878
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:15,900
Oh.

2879
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:18,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

2880
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:21,280
I need a time.

2881
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:23,260
It's so hard to time that.

2882
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:27,980
Because if you do it too...

2883
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:29,800
Because if you do it too...

2884
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:31,520
I feel like I do it too early.

2885
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:33,440
I do it too early every time.

2886
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:35,120
I need to be more patient.

2887
02:46:39,860 --> 02:46:40,300
Yeah.

2888
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:47,280
Okay.

2889
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:54,760
Okay, that's pretty funny.

2890
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:06,270
I'm gonna grab this guy out of the way.

2891
02:47:06,510 --> 02:47:07,650
No clones allowed.

2892
02:47:09,190 --> 02:47:09,630
There you go.

2893
02:47:10,590 --> 02:47:12,230
I'm gonna save my life defensively.

2894
02:47:12,930 --> 02:47:13,810
I'll do double.

2895
02:47:14,590 --> 02:47:16,450
Like right now, I guess this would...

2896
02:47:16,450 --> 02:47:17,470
Alright, there we go.

2897
02:47:18,210 --> 02:47:19,190
Oh, I hope he lives.

2898
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:24,350
I guess not.

2899
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:26,790
I did say I hope he lives.

2900
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:27,870
I did.

2901
02:47:28,710 --> 02:47:32,950
It was unlucky that he did not live.

2902
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:46,640
But, look, unfortunately, what I want might not be it.

2903
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:49,080
I mean, I can't DPS this.

2904
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:49,900
Oh, shit.

2905
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:50,660
Oh, shit.

2906
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:51,500
I'm sorry, buddy.

2907
02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:53,400
I'm sorry I was...

2908
02:47:57,800 --> 02:47:59,240
That's fine.

2909
02:48:01,240 --> 02:48:03,540
Oh shit, that low key was so low.

2910
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:07,860
I think I blinded somebody in there.

2911
02:48:07,980 --> 02:48:09,020
Can I...

2912
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:12,300
Actually...

2913
02:48:12,300 --> 02:48:14,720
What the fucking miss?

2914
02:48:17,780 --> 02:48:18,400
Oh yeah.

2915
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:21,580
Jesus Christ, fuck this.

2916
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:24,080

Oh my god.

2919
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:26,900
Am I?

2920
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:33,460
No longer.

2921
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:40,140
Oh god, we're dead.

2922
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:44,420
You're dead.

2923
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:47,320
Yeah, that's strange.

2924
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:48,060
Clutched it.

2925
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:48,880
Can you swap, bro?

2926
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:50,160
Like you're actually doing nothing.

2927
02:48:50,380 --> 02:48:51,480
Don't you put all eyes over here?

2928
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:55,800
Wait, who is he saying?

2929
02:48:55,900 --> 02:48:56,900

Oh, I'm fist.

2931
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:03,280
That's unlucky.

2932
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:05,900
I didn't even want to be over there, too.

2933
02:49:06,220 --> 02:49:06,540
Oh, my God.

2934
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:08,200

I blinded him.

2952
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:13,850
That's the best blind I've ever done.

2953
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:18,880
Oh, never mind.

2954

It was just, you know.

2971
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:31,530
I don't know.

2972
02:52:31,650 --> 02:52:32,830
I left clicked.

2973
02:52:33,230 --> 02:52:36,210
How much more can I left click for you?

2974
02:52:36,590 --> 02:52:37,550

Yeah, not me.

2977
02:52:49,320 --> 02:52:49,800
hippie

2978
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:55,340
not not toky though

2979
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:10,140
yeah no i did a lot of heals there 57 that's what i'm saying
i was like what more can i do i heal so much

2980
02:53:14,370 --> 02:53:20,890
there was oh yeah i should actually i keep forgetting to
avoid people usually Yeah, I don't avoid people.

2981
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:22,930
I mean, I do avoid people, but...

2982
02:53:26,230 --> 02:53:28,990
Wait, no, we had two melee characters.

2983
02:53:30,510 --> 02:53:30,990
Like...

2984
02:53:30,990 --> 02:53:33,230
Yeah, I don't know if this white wasn't it either.

2985
02:53:34,610 --> 02:53:36,350
Like, I don't mind if we had two...

2986
02:53:36,350 --> 02:53:39,610
If we had a melee character, we just have two melee
characters.

2987
02:53:42,550 --> 02:53:43,690
Yeah, I didn't throw.

2988
02:53:43,750 --> 02:53:44,570
That's the good part.

2989
02:53:44,630 --> 02:53:46,390
I tried my heart out.

2990
02:53:47,930 --> 02:53:49,290
That's all that matters.

2991
02:53:51,090 --> 02:53:51,970
Oh, people are deafening.

2992
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:53,250
I should deafen then.

2993
02:53:55,850 --> 02:53:56,230
Sorry.

2994
02:53:56,390 --> 02:54:02,650
You had the little ASMR, the try-hard ASMR from my teammates
when they were playing Rink.

2995
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:07,940
Oh, next game is going to be a while.

2996
02:54:09,180 --> 02:54:16,520
Because apparently one team is not even fucking starting
their game because they're complaining about how they played

2997
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:17,400
against the coach.

2998
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:29,180
to play so um I don't they're just drama farming right now
apparently um

2999
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:41,400
which hero do you think you want to be today they're drama
farming this tournament at the moment so they're refusing to

3000
02:54:41,400 --> 02:54:51,960
play the game because um because they don't want to play
against the top 16 coach subs aren't yeah subs aren't

3001
02:54:51,960 --> 02:54:58,560
allowed but coaches can play because the reasoning is that
coaches aren't actually playing in the game they're not

3002
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:02,640
screaming or like they're not actually playing oh my god
like i

3003
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:11,960
it's just people

3004
02:55:20,340 --> 02:55:29,500
are just farming drama now after the kingsman stuff just
understand what happened you have hard bullied by his team

3005
02:55:29,500 --> 02:55:38,060
but now everyone is like you're seeing that as like i can
use this to engagement bait now so like everyone is like

3006
02:55:38,060 --> 02:55:40,660
every tournament is now getting drama farmed

3007
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:50,580
because they're like oh they worked for kingsman it's gonna
work for me too but like the kingsman situation was like its

3008
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:54,420
own little bubble type deal it was like

3009
02:55:57,720 --> 02:56:06,360
the coattails it's like its own little um unique thing that
happened like a once in a light time not once but like you

3010
02:56:06,360 --> 02:56:11,320
know it's like its own little event that you can't really
like replicate

3011
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:29,980
it's like when like you just tweet any mention about
kingsman and then and then it's like you will get like

3012
02:56:29,980 --> 02:56:34,500
thousands of likes comments and like reaction comments too

3013
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:52,340
But like now, yeah, it was organic, but now everybody is
priming drama for like, like, like any tournament now.

3014
02:56:58,400 --> 02:57:03,580
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

3015
02:57:12,780 --> 02:57:13,840
Oh my god.

3016

02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:47,980
Yo!

3037
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:53,240
Oh, if we had to...

3038
02:58:53,240 --> 02:58:54,020
Oh, guys.

3039
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:56,800
We should have had...

3040
02:58:56,800 --> 02:58:58,740
We should have two people pushing it.

3041
02:59:00,040 --> 02:59:02,500
Here we go again!

3042
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:12,070
Alright.

3043
02:59:14,470 --> 02:59:16,150
We still have Jeff up.

3044
02:59:18,430 --> 02:59:29,050
I bumped into like a player that animated, um, that like
animated, uh, icons for all their support.

3045
02:59:29,290 --> 02:59:35,530
And I was like, Jesus, fuck, but he was like, she was like,
she or he was like the same rank as me.

3046
02:59:38,310 --> 02:59:46,290
so i'm just like thinking like do you did you like i don't
know did you like farm all of that in like fucking like like

3047
02:59:46,290 --> 02:59:58,230
and quickly because like how though that's like that's like
crazy in general like she had it i think she had it on like

3048
02:59:58,230 --> 03:00:03,750
four like four to five supports i'm like oh my god

3049
03:00:07,310 --> 03:00:08,190
Lord farm?

3050
03:00:08,570 --> 03:00:10,970
What is Lord farming?

3051
03:00:11,730 --> 03:00:12,450
I always see that.

3052
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:15,470
Apparently, there's like, people do, like, there's, like,
illegal Lord farming rings.

3053
03:00:16,030 --> 03:00:17,650
I don't know what that is.

3054
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:23,420
Like, what the fuck you can...

3055
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:30,220
Because, like, it's so illegal that the devs actually made a
statement about it and was like, yeah, we're gonna shut that

3056
03:00:30,220 --> 03:00:32,560
down because you're not supposed to actually do that.

3057
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:34,640
I'm like, what the fuck?

3058
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:37,580
People are doing illegal Lord farming?

3059
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:38,480
Like, what?

3060
03:00:38,860 --> 03:00:41,060
What does that even mean?

3061
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:45,180
I'm so confused.

3062
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:48,540
Like, how do you illegal lord fight?

3063
03:00:51,540 --> 03:00:55,860
The best part about playing cloak is that I don't have to
actually focus.

3064
03:00:57,700 --> 03:00:59,960
Watch this, the namer's gonna fucking ult me.

3065
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:01,420
Oh, nope.

3066
03:01:01,640 --> 03:01:02,420
Okay, that's fine.

3067
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:03,460
I'm not fine with that.

3068
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:05,580
What the fuck?

3069
03:01:08,020 --> 03:01:09,640
Does nobody die?

3070
03:01:10,140 --> 03:01:14,040
Like, okay, I assume that...

3071
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:15,920
Like, he's just standing there.

3072
03:01:16,020 --> 03:01:17,020
He's actually an NPC.

3073
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:18,460
Right here.

3074
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:20,200
There is no way we're...

3075
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:21,880
We're fucking sending this shit.

3076
03:01:22,040 --> 03:01:23,760
There is no way we're letting this...

3077
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:27,620
There is no way we're letting this NPC win.

3078
03:01:32,670 --> 03:01:35,830
That's actually NPC behavior, what I just saw.

3079
03:01:36,470 --> 03:01:37,670
Holy shit.

3080
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:51,300
All right, bro, what the fuck is this E though?

3081
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:59,260
I don't play Rink for a while and this is the shit I see.

3082
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:00,840
Bro, that, I'm sorry.

3083
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:02,840
That Namer is actually an NPC.

3084
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:06,720
I feel like I'm seeing the whole universe.

3085
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:08,720
Just in this web.

3086
03:02:09,320 --> 03:02:13,700
Uh, I want to let...

3087
03:02:14,220 --> 03:02:16,540
I personally just wanted to cap the point.

3088
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:17,140
but

3089
03:02:20,920 --> 03:02:32,940

that neighbor's literally just standing there it's crazy

3091
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:54,120
That's actually insane What I'm looking at right now

3092
03:02:57,960 --> 03:03:06,740
There you go, he's blinded You can't see You can't see no
more But you see that we heal each other As long as we heal

3093
03:03:06,740 --> 03:03:08,560
each other We should be fine

3094
03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:33,860
There we go Bro, this guy is actually as fuck I will oh my

3096
03:03:50,450 --> 03:04:06,010

3098
03:04:16,170 --> 03:04:27,270

3099
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:39,600
Like legally speaking He definitely should not be playing
this game

3100
03:04:44,350 --> 03:04:46,530
There we go, I don't care

3101
03:04:49,810 --> 03:04:50,890
All right

3102
03:04:54,370 --> 03:04:55,330
All right

3103
03:05:00,590 --> 03:05:04,190
Bro, this Elo, this Elo is so interesting.

3104
03:05:10,730 --> 03:05:13,350
This Elo is so interesting.

3105
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:17,950
Yeah, the Neymar, not gonna- no, he is right though.

3106
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:23,790
He's- Oh, wait, I should have avoided the magic as well.

3107
03:05:23,850 --> 03:05:27,090
Why the fuck did I only avoid the Iron Fist?

3108
03:05:27,430 --> 03:05:33,550
I just realized I still have- I have the same fucking magic
on my team.

3109
03:05:33,710 --> 03:05:36,070
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

3110
03:05:36,910 --> 03:05:40,010
Oh, we're all playing ranked because we have to...

3111
03:05:40,410 --> 03:05:41,770
We're just waiting.

3112
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:50,820
We're just waiting.

3113
03:05:55,140 --> 03:05:58,060
It's like the tournament hasn't started yet.

3114
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:02,220
I mean, it started, but we're waiting for the next game.

3115
03:06:04,260 --> 03:06:05,960
I don't know, honestly.

3116
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:08,240
I don't know if the other team's still doing their shit.

3117
03:06:14,230 --> 03:06:18,430
Yeah, like, our thing hasn't, like, come up yet on, like,
who we're firsting next.

3118
03:06:18,790 --> 03:06:20,050
30 seconds before you attack.

3119
03:06:20,410 --> 03:06:20,890
Get ready.

3120
03:06:24,410 --> 03:06:24,710
Nah.

3121
03:06:25,170 --> 03:06:27,330
Not in the Elo that we're in.

3122
03:06:27,590 --> 03:06:28,790
We can't play in the same.

3123
03:06:29,290 --> 03:06:29,950
We can't stack.

3124
03:06:30,910 --> 03:06:32,710
In fact, we're closer than ever.

3125
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:42,400
It's actually a bit more complicated than that.

3126
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:43,880
Bum bum bum bum.

3127
03:06:46,980 --> 03:07:01,300

There we go.

3133
03:07:32,100 --> 03:07:33,300
Okay, my team tag.

3134
03:07:33,360 --> 03:07:34,140
I'm playing quick play.

3135
03:07:35,740 --> 03:07:37,700
This is quick play, honestly.

3136
03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:44,460
This is fucking quick play shit right now.

3137
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:52,400
I feel like I am playing quick play.

3138
03:07:52,420 --> 03:08:00,980
there you go like i'm not playing a real game honestly

3139
03:08:06,720 --> 03:08:09,460
this does not feel like a real fucking game

3140
03:08:15,960 --> 03:08:18,880
i don't even know if i'm getting good practice

3141
03:08:22,280 --> 03:08:26,800
Well, I wanted to play the zombie game.

3142
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:32,440
Like, I don't know if we're making good progress right now.

3143
03:08:36,060 --> 03:08:38,720
Get out of here, man.

3144
03:08:41,060 --> 03:08:43,180
Probably double support, that'll do it.

3145
03:08:43,900 --> 03:08:45,120
I'm lucky.

3146
03:08:46,260 --> 03:08:46,420
Yeah.

3147
03:08:50,930 --> 03:08:51,810
Jesus.

3148
03:08:52,810 --> 03:08:54,250
Fucking crap.

3149
03:08:54,270 --> 03:09:04,690
that's crazy the amount of damage I just fucking encountered
oh I I wanted to shift out and that's unlucky I couldn't

3150
03:09:04,690 --> 03:09:07,310
shift out in time I was fine my team won

3151
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:21,270
I didn't react I don't know I feel like there's a delay
whenever I do the shifting with cloak

3152
03:09:31,940 --> 03:09:41,540
oh there he's doing that thing is he coming to us he's
coming to us isn't he because you see you see

3153
03:09:44,940 --> 03:09:46,880

3180
03:12:27,310 --> 03:12:28,350
I'm refreshing.

What round are we at?

3182
03:12:32,450 --> 03:12:34,590
The third round has not started.

3183
03:12:35,110 --> 03:12:37,430

I didn't think that many teams would sign up to this.

3198
03:13:31,220 --> 03:13:32,980
Is it this more than the MRC and NA?

3199
03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:36,020
It's probably because of last season.

3200
03:13:36,860 --> 03:13:37,380
Oh, hey.

3201
03:13:37,740 --> 03:13:39,900
Hawkeye's coming on January 26th.

3202
03:13:39,960 --> 03:13:40,280
All right.

3203
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:40,780
That's cool.

3204
03:13:40,860 --> 03:13:41,320
I feel like it's a lot more.

3205
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:45,680
Here we'll share an in-depth look at Haigard full game.

3206
03:13:45,860 --> 03:13:46,680
Oh, hey, look.

3207
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:47,860
Haigard released.

3208
03:13:48,360 --> 03:13:49,100
Oh, it's in two days.

3209
03:13:49,100 --> 03:13:50,500
Oh, no, I meant the amount of teams participating.

3210
03:13:50,740 --> 03:13:51,300
Wait, what?

3211
03:13:51,460 --> 03:13:52,340
Oh, yeah, of course.

3212
03:13:52,600 --> 03:13:53,580
Yeah, yeah.

3213
03:13:53,720 --> 03:13:54,840
I feel like it's a lot more for this.

3214
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:56,040
Okay, launch showcase.

3215
03:13:56,320 --> 03:13:57,840
Even like the lower teams, they get top 60.

3216
03:13:57,860 --> 03:14:05,800
okay two days guys we're finally gonna get in-depth look
it's actually a lot so it's like worth to participate in

3217
03:14:05,800 --> 03:14:19,540
some sense true and we get nothing we only get money i'm
gonna use i'm gonna nervous pee again or what do you mean

3218
03:14:19,540 --> 03:14:29,660
bro if we place like top six we get like 500 bucks each oh
no i man in MRC but oh oh never mind I mean in the of course

3219
03:14:29,660 --> 03:14:38,020
it's a lot of money but like I'm saying for the more 500
bucks not that super insane for professionals I see yeah

3220
03:14:38,020 --> 03:14:47,540
it's a lot of games it's also not that fun you know because
the thing is like in MRC with like a full protein you just

3221
03:14:47,540 --> 03:14:54,300
stomp through the games like there's until the top eight
there's no interesting game for someone like us so it's like

3222
03:14:54,300 --> 03:15:02,920
yeah four weeks or three weeks of not interesting games and
just like such a heavy time in list for no progress in

3223
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:09,080
competition right because we always want to play to get
better right so it's like yeah it's why we always scream

3224
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:15,140
only good teams too right this is like not ego or anything
but it's just like pointless to scream we get teams you know

3225
03:15:15,140 --> 03:15:22,980
because you don't get anything out of it as hard as it
sounds so it's like kind of the same case have to play like

3226
03:15:22,980 --> 03:15:30,520
three weeks of stomping teams they can't do anything about
it either like they just want to have fun and then they face

3227
03:15:30,520 --> 03:15:35,520
like us we just troll and go whatever we want and still win
because we're just like individually so much better which

3228
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:45,560
makes sense you know it's like normal i'm like when are so
sure not fun for the enemy teams too when do we play it's

3229
03:15:45,560 --> 03:15:57,220
not good for the vibes but that's why when we play mrc teams
are banned from ignite i'm okay you can't play mrc at the

3230
03:15:57,220 --> 03:16:08,100
same time only yeah every time that server is no so mrc's
kind of like tier two almost yeah during ignited tier two

3231
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:17,840
i'm not sure i i would that came out of your soul i just i
thought i was like i haven't even lunch yet either uh so if

3232
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:27,840
you qualify to learn because they're like the last game
would start at kind of like that i'm too gullible otherwise

3233
03:16:27,840 --> 03:16:36,980
you can have like like let's see how many regions are there
like i'm way too gullible i saw like oh it's fine um to be

3234
03:16:36,980 --> 03:16:49,160
called tier one i think i was like oh the schedule says that
the tournament ends at at 3 30 p.m

3235
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:58,460
how's that oh that seems that's cool it was just 3 30.

3236
03:16:58,700 --> 03:16:59,840
i can make that work

3237
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:18,630
every time she fell for it again i should order food i'm
order food right now i don't know she fell for it again i

3238
03:17:18,630 --> 03:17:20,130

3239
03:17:38,340 --> 03:17:41,320
I have fell for it again, a horde.

3240
03:17:42,980 --> 03:17:43,740
I'm gonna risk it.

3241
03:17:43,800 --> 03:17:45,580
I'm gonna play a fucking game.

3242
03:17:50,400 --> 03:17:51,600
I'm gonna...

3243
03:18:04,260 --> 03:18:06,660
I'm looking for food right now.

3244
03:18:17,590 --> 03:18:18,070
Alright.

3245
03:18:21,080 --> 03:18:22,320
I'm doing it.

3246
03:18:22,520 --> 03:18:24,000
I'm gonna fucking do it.

3247
03:18:24,780 --> 03:18:25,780

I'm gonna do it!

3249
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:29,640

3250
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:35,340
Sorry, I ordered food.

3251
03:18:36,280 --> 03:18:36,980
I ordered something.

3252
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:38,060
I ordered something.

3253
03:19:00,040 --> 03:19:00,560
Alright.

3254
03:19:04,970 --> 03:19:07,750
One of the others are you have to move the other stream to a
different game.

3255
03:19:07,990 --> 03:19:11,130
I just, I wanted to play the zombie game.

3256
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:15,350
I really wanted to play the zombie game.

3257
03:19:15,450 --> 03:19:15,790
No!

3258
03:19:18,110 --> 03:19:20,790
Please, can I play cloak?

3259
03:19:21,990 --> 03:19:24,330
I need to practice it.

3260
03:19:24,690 --> 03:19:28,370
We're at the J3 tournament right now.

3261
03:19:34,810 --> 03:19:36,810
Please, I'm on my knees.

3262
03:19:41,460 --> 03:19:43,490
I'm on my knees.

3263
03:19:53,410 --> 03:19:53,990
Yeah.

3264
03:19:59,930 --> 03:20:01,170
I'm too desperate.

3265
03:20:01,570 --> 03:20:03,350
I have no shame anymore.

3266
03:20:04,330 --> 03:20:06,110
There's no more shame here.

3267
03:20:11,830 --> 03:20:13,570
Shame is gone.

3268
03:20:17,780 --> 03:20:18,640
All you.

3269
03:20:21,780 --> 03:20:24,000
Oh, the other team's playing Cloak as well.

3270
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:25,360

3271
03:20:29,720 --> 03:20:36,360
Well, rivals players are actually nice for once it's

3273
03:20:50,910 --> 03:21:00,450
it's like the one percent when a when a rival's player
doesn't slur at you the one the one percent when it happens

3274
03:21:00,450 --> 03:21:08,330
it's a rare moment in life When the Ravals player does not
slur.

3275
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:18,420
We have Zaza 2.2.

3276
03:21:19,440 --> 03:21:19,440

03:21:24,070 --> 03:21:27,410

I saved you defensively

I mean, they're not throwing or they're playing the game

3286
03:22:41,400 --> 03:22:48,040
Doesn't look like they're throwing me the guy I mean the guy

3287
03:22:51,240 --> 03:22:55,680

There we go.

3311
03:26:35,380 --> 03:26:36,100
We did it.

3312
03:26:47,490 --> 03:26:49,110
Alright, here we go.

3313
03:26:53,120 --> 03:26:55,540
My vibes persevered.

3314
03:26:56,920 --> 03:26:57,880
We're doing it.

3315
03:26:59,080 --> 03:27:00,440
The power of vibes.

3316
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:02,420
I just vibe here and then try later.

3317
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:06,240
That's how it goes.

3318
03:27:07,320 --> 03:27:08,920
Vibe here, try later.

3319
03:27:16,530 --> 03:27:16,970
Wee.

3320
03:27:18,070 --> 03:27:19,170
The rules of comp.

3321
03:27:23,130 --> 03:27:26,110
I need to get better at blinds.

3322
03:27:26,110 --> 03:27:26,570
For real.

3323
03:27:27,170 --> 03:27:29,790
At least like thank god nobody's playing mag on the enemy
team.

3324
03:27:31,130 --> 03:27:32,510
That's also why I don't like playing cloak.

3325
03:27:32,810 --> 03:27:38,390
It's just because like the enemy team will always have a mag
in rank because every fucking tank in the goddamn world

3326
03:27:38,390 --> 03:27:38,910
plays mag.

3327
03:27:42,870 --> 03:27:48,290
Well, like, apparently in tournament, no one fucking plays
mag, apparently, because everyone just plays dive.

3328
03:27:56,590 --> 03:27:57,710
That's crazy.

3329
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:05,440
Get in that circle.

3330
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:06,540
Get in my circle!

3331
03:28:06,720 --> 03:28:07,560
What the fuck?

3332
03:28:08,240 --> 03:28:11,320
Invis, I made... Oh my... I made the circle for you.

3333
03:28:11,840 --> 03:28:13,060

Alright.

Come on, please.

3345
03:29:57,580 --> 03:29:58,740

It's not... I will still be playing...

3349
03:30:05,860 --> 03:30:08,520
I'll still be waiting for, like, 20 more years.

3350
03:30:11,200 --> 03:30:12,520
No res beacon, by the way.

3351
03:30:13,260 --> 03:30:14,160
Alright, here we go.

3352
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:18,840
I mean, that's cool.

3353
03:30:19,980 --> 03:30:21,820
Oh, that's cool, I guess.

3354
03:30:23,960 --> 03:30:26,020
Do we like just, we just don't like fucking...

3355
03:30:27,800 --> 03:30:30,020
We just don't...

3356
03:30:31,420 --> 03:30:32,720
Wait, Kirk, do you have a lobby?

3357
03:30:33,940 --> 03:30:34,600
He's not here.

3358
03:30:35,380 --> 03:30:36,000
Alright, I'm out of here.

3359
03:30:39,100 --> 03:30:39,580
Alright.

3360
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:40,620
Aha.

3361
03:30:43,160 --> 03:30:44,880
Alright, how about...

3362
03:30:45,620 --> 03:30:48,860
I might have found something that cooked my internet.

3363
03:30:50,520 --> 03:30:50,900
Maybe.

3364
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:54,080
Oh, bye spotty man.

3365
03:30:54,820 --> 03:30:56,680
I'm just gonna let my invis you.

3366
03:30:57,940 --> 03:30:59,760
But I don't need to be here.

3367
03:31:01,280 --> 03:31:01,460
What?

3368
03:31:01,780 --> 03:31:02,580
Where did my invis go?

3369
03:31:03,800 --> 03:31:05,360
I was like, I swear to God.

3370
03:31:09,140 --> 03:31:09,880
Okay, goodbye.

3371
03:31:10,100 --> 03:31:11,140
You're so dead.

3372
03:31:13,540 --> 03:31:14,400
Oh my god!

3373
03:31:14,740 --> 03:31:15,160
What the fuck?

3374
03:31:15,160 --> 03:31:15,560
I can't wait to lay down.

3375
03:31:15,700 --> 03:31:16,520
I'm actually so tired.

3376
03:31:16,680 --> 03:31:18,120
I can imagine what time is for you, trust me.

3377
03:31:20,020 --> 03:31:21,740
Okay, there's nothing I could do there.

3378
03:31:22,060 --> 03:31:23,740
You fucking fucked me up.

3379
03:31:24,800 --> 03:31:26,240
That guy fucked me up.

3380
03:31:26,320 --> 03:31:27,660
Really got a couple more hours.

3381
03:31:29,180 --> 03:31:30,400
Just two more games, right?

3382
03:31:30,580 --> 03:31:32,100
This is the last game.

3383
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:33,620
This game has been Roman.

3384
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:35,620
Yeah, it's your game.

3385
03:31:36,680 --> 03:31:36,960
Yes.

3386
03:31:38,260 --> 03:31:39,880
And then another four tomorrow.

3387
03:31:40,580 --> 03:31:41,620
And then...

3388
03:31:42,280 --> 03:31:44,520
I think it's... I don't know how many on Sunday, I'm not
sure.

3389
03:31:44,980 --> 03:31:45,620
I'll try that.

3390
03:31:46,020 --> 03:31:46,640
Maybe not.

3391
03:31:46,760 --> 03:31:49,120
Just the internet.

3392
03:31:50,780 --> 03:31:59,160

3394
03:32:10,860 --> 03:32:22,360
buddies you want to raise snakers you can be angry and
cursed I haven't played Outer Ring in like a while.

3395
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:24,620
This is not good.

3396
03:32:25,720 --> 03:32:26,860
This is not good.

3397
03:32:26,860 --> 03:32:29,340
I tried keeping it in me.

3398
03:32:29,900 --> 03:32:33,180
This is not good.

3399
03:32:35,420 --> 03:32:37,280
For the second time.

3400
03:32:37,960 --> 03:32:40,060
But I had a lot of health for the run, so...

3401
03:32:40,060 --> 03:32:42,060
I see, I see.

3402
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:44,280
I still need to play the DLC.

3403
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:46,140
Oh really?

3404
03:32:46,240 --> 03:32:47,080
I played like some of it.

3405
03:32:47,240 --> 03:32:48,000
I didn't beat it.

3406
03:32:48,100 --> 03:32:48,800
I need to beat it.

3407
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:51,620
They're down one, by the way.

3408
03:32:52,720 --> 03:32:55,340
You'll have to keep fighting until we have a winner.

3409
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:56,640
Bro,

3410
03:33:00,960 --> 03:33:01,680
I did double.

3411
03:33:10,420 --> 03:33:12,920
Oh my god, there's nothing I could do.

3412
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:16,980
I was literally 4%.

3413
03:33:18,980 --> 03:33:20,100
No, please!

3414
03:33:22,100 --> 03:33:24,020
Oh my god, get me out!

3415
03:33:24,320 --> 03:33:27,000
I need to get to the other game!

3416
03:33:29,100 --> 03:33:31,060
Light doesn't dispel darkness.

3417
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:34,160
It helps me see the darkness and face it

3418
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:40,340
It tied?

3419
03:33:40,700 --> 03:33:45,980
That's crazy 30 seconds before you attack get ready

3420
03:33:49,460 --> 03:33:57,140
We thought you were gone after the vampire oh my god I don't
care if we win or lose honestly

3421
03:34:02,190 --> 03:34:07,750
Oh, it's just best to us three basically Basically, I'm not
best for three, it's just like win lot, you know.

3422
03:34:10,550 --> 03:34:10,910
Alright.

3423
03:34:13,010 --> 03:34:14,250
I'm just waiting for Lobby.

3424
03:34:14,610 --> 03:34:15,330
Just so you know guys.

3425
03:34:15,590 --> 03:34:16,530
Okay, waiting for Lobby.

3426
03:34:16,830 --> 03:34:17,510
Okay, that's fine.

3427
03:34:18,870 --> 03:34:20,950
What has Victor gotten us into this time?

3428
03:34:20,990 --> 03:34:22,270
Yeah, invite me.

3429
03:34:24,430 --> 03:34:25,090
Oh wait.

3430
03:34:25,630 --> 03:34:26,970
Oh my god, I'm on the wrong account.

3431
03:34:27,190 --> 03:34:27,570
I can't.

3432
03:34:27,710 --> 03:34:29,470
Okay, here you go.

3433
03:34:32,370 --> 03:34:33,410
This guy is not smart.

3434
03:34:34,590 --> 03:34:37,590
I need to change most, but I think I'll play with the...

3435
03:34:40,390 --> 03:34:43,630
Like, I need us to, like, bro, fuck this.

3436
03:34:45,890 --> 03:34:48,090
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna fall.

3437
03:34:50,130 --> 03:34:50,990
There we go.

3438
03:34:51,610 --> 03:34:52,890
Oh, that's embarrassing.

3439
03:34:53,490 --> 03:34:55,910
Guys, I don't think we're winning this now.

3440
03:34:58,870 --> 03:35:00,590
Oh, wait, unless...

3441
03:35:03,010 --> 03:35:03,470
Unless...

3442
03:35:04,890 --> 03:35:07,530
Just use every ult possible.

3443
03:35:08,410 --> 03:35:09,930
Never mind, it is still winnable.

3444
03:35:10,250 --> 03:35:11,370
You should have asked for both.

3445
03:35:12,590 --> 03:35:14,090
The big one and the small one.

3446
03:35:14,390 --> 03:35:15,570
Those finals tastes strange.

3447
03:35:16,670 --> 03:35:17,710
You gotta be greedy bro.

3448
03:35:17,970 --> 03:35:19,190
I almost fell off.

3449
03:35:20,350 --> 03:35:21,650
Yeah, I need one too.

3450
03:35:21,930 --> 03:35:23,690
I almost fell off the fuck's a cliff.

3451
03:35:24,570 --> 03:35:26,810
Maybe we should design our own, we should make a venom rose
pet.

3452
03:35:27,570 --> 03:35:28,450
$1 venom rose pet.

3453
03:35:29,350 --> 03:35:30,150
That'd be pretty cool.

3454
03:35:30,350 --> 03:35:31,590
It can be $1 though.

3455
03:35:31,730 --> 03:35:32,870
It needs to be 100.

3456
03:35:34,590 --> 03:35:36,590
The official snake is over here.

3457
03:35:37,290 --> 03:35:38,350
This is fine.

3458
03:35:38,730 --> 03:35:44,590
Say it in the- Say it in the- Oh my god, oh my god, that's-
I'm-

3459
03:35:50,290 --> 03:35:51,350
Oh, I watched this.

3460
03:35:51,790 --> 03:35:52,510
The moon!

3461
03:35:53,370 --> 03:35:55,430
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

3462
03:35:57,170 --> 03:35:59,170
Guys, guys, port, port.

3463
03:35:59,370 --> 03:36:00,470
Nice, get- get it.

3464
03:36:02,170 --> 03:36:04,010
Other teams are gonna drop out.

3465
03:36:04,590 --> 03:36:05,650
Because like it's so late.

3466
03:36:06,130 --> 03:36:06,910
Rocket legit one.

3467
03:36:07,590 --> 03:36:07,830
Okay.

3468
03:36:08,110 --> 03:36:08,830
We don't want to claim anymore.

3469
03:36:10,750 --> 03:36:11,390
No, probably not.

3470
03:36:11,970 --> 03:36:12,370
Never mind.

3471
03:36:12,850 --> 03:36:14,850
All right.

3472
03:36:17,640 --> 03:36:17,720
No more.

3473
03:36:18,740 --> 03:36:18,800
No more.

3474
03:36:18,800 --> 03:36:19,720
No more.

3475
03:36:19,760 --> 03:36:19,820
No more.

3476
03:36:19,880 --> 03:36:20,000
No more.

3477
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:24,520
We still need to claim the price for MRC, by the way.

3478
03:36:24,640 --> 03:36:26,440
There's no lobby yet.

3479
03:36:28,540 --> 03:36:30,260
We're waiting on them.

3480
03:36:30,680 --> 03:36:32,100
There's a lower seat again.

3481
03:36:32,620 --> 03:36:34,880
I want to know, is Crook depressed?

3482
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:36,320
Did they attack you back?

3483
03:36:36,820 --> 03:36:39,800
They're like, is he okay?

3484
03:36:40,920 --> 03:36:42,460
Are you in contact with him?

3485
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:44,400
No, not yet.

3486
03:36:44,620 --> 03:36:46,100
He sounds very sad.

3487
03:36:48,380 --> 03:36:49,660
He's not answering on Discord.

3488
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:55,100
Oh my god, he sounds very, very depressed.

3489
03:36:55,180 --> 03:36:56,040
You can only answer.

3490
03:36:56,840 --> 03:37:01,000
So I'm just, you know, it's just an honest question.

3491
03:37:01,180 --> 03:37:02,020
Like, is he okay?

3492
03:37:04,040 --> 03:37:04,720
5G.

3493
03:37:05,480 --> 03:37:06,540
That's fine.

3494
03:37:11,100 --> 03:37:11,820
That's huge.

3495
03:37:12,100 --> 03:37:14,040
I'm just tired because of the long waits.

3496
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:17,960
This stage is so exhausting.

3497
03:37:18,200 --> 03:37:18,920
There we go.

3498
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:21,140
Chavez.

3499
03:37:21,740 --> 03:37:23,220
He's just European.

3500
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:25,700
Is he European or depressed?

3501
03:37:26,640 --> 03:37:28,580
He's like, is he gay or European?

3502
03:37:29,160 --> 03:37:35,060
But he's just like, is he depressed or European?

3503
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:38,400
The better.

3504
03:37:42,940 --> 03:37:43,540
Same.

3505
03:37:44,280 --> 03:37:45,060
It could be both.

3506
03:37:50,220 --> 03:37:52,300
They are born in the pressure.

3507
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:57,080
They're just born with it.

3508
03:37:59,140 --> 03:38:02,020
Yeah, they gave... let me practice cloak.

3509
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:02,840
Yippee.

3510
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:07,180
Are we against the diamond team, by the way?

3511
03:38:09,940 --> 03:38:23,650
oh nice why did everyone someone's on console so I just saw
the discord group damn

3512
03:38:29,010 --> 03:38:34,430
depression is just pre-installed what which European country
is he from is it common

3513
03:38:44,080 --> 03:38:50,120
Hungary and Austria oh that's like the double combo

3514
03:38:53,480 --> 03:39:04,120
it's hungary in austria that's a wild combo lame day for us
two pro teams gg for them that's a bummer it's just how it

3515
03:39:04,120 --> 03:39:10,540
goes sometimes i guess it's how it goes unfortunately but
the same for us apparently yeah kind of wants to similar

3516
03:39:10,540 --> 03:39:17,040
thoughts no that's crazy that we play energies team out of
600 teams in the second round the team that we stripped as i

3517
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:22,760
said we'd lose nothing from it so just focus on next it's
good yeah the only thing that can happen we face terror but

3518
03:39:22,760 --> 03:39:29,020
i don't think they would happen we have to place top either
then we can win thank we can win any game we could have won

3519
03:39:29,020 --> 03:39:36,800
against him too i think it was very close we could have won
like i can show you how we can win like if you if you want

3520
03:39:36,800 --> 03:39:43,660
like after this as i said so there's waiting time in between
yeah there's 600 teams yeah something to gain out of it you

3521
03:39:43,660 --> 03:39:52,700
know wait they're actually tweeting now the high guard
twitter is actually tweeting now oh my god wait i just

3522
03:39:52,700 --> 03:40:02,340
realized they started tweeting i thought they were like
three days in three days you can play high guard yeah

3523
03:40:02,340 --> 03:40:14,360

I'll leave.

3532
03:40:37,300 --> 03:40:38,720
That's Ashley crazy.

3533
03:40:39,640 --> 03:40:41,340
Go, who's hopping on high guard?

3534
03:40:41,820 --> 03:40:42,760
What are you waiting?

3535
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:44,240
Is it high or low?

3536
03:40:44,560 --> 03:40:44,640
Oops.

3537
03:40:44,860 --> 03:40:45,600
Is it high or low?

3538
03:40:45,740 --> 03:40:46,240
Oh, no.

3539
03:40:46,940 --> 03:40:48,400
Can you help me play after?

3540
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:49,540
I need to get high rank.

3541
03:40:51,800 --> 03:40:56,000
Okay, Loki wanted to take a nap after this match, but you
can play.

3542
03:40:56,180 --> 03:40:56,180
What?

3543
03:40:56,180 --> 03:40:56,720
There's one more?

3544
03:40:57,760 --> 03:40:58,780
I think so.

3545
03:40:59,500 --> 03:41:00,340
Is there not?

3546
03:41:00,560 --> 03:41:01,060
In between?

3547
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:02,040
On stream?

3548
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:02,560
No, no.

3549
03:41:03,340 --> 03:41:04,640
Not on stream.

3550
03:41:05,960 --> 03:41:05,980
Okay.

3551
03:41:08,420 --> 03:41:09,840
I'm not napping on stream.

3552
03:41:10,400 --> 03:41:11,800
You're taking a nap at midnight.

3553
03:41:12,660 --> 03:41:13,460
Bro, it's late.

3554
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:14,700
Yeah, I don't know.

3555
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:16,460
I'm just so bored from waiting.

3556
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:17,540
I'm so bored.

3557
03:41:18,460 --> 03:41:19,880
I believe you do, bro.

3558
03:41:22,480 --> 03:41:23,360
Drink a...

3559
03:41:23,360 --> 03:41:24,500
Drink an energy drink.

3560
03:41:24,820 --> 03:41:25,960
Well, we can't say the name of whatever one.

3561
03:41:25,980 --> 03:41:27,300
You don't understand Krook, Snake Case.

3562
03:41:27,560 --> 03:41:31,820
Krook is the kind of guy that wakes up in the morning,
30-minute meditation session, you know.

3563
03:41:32,160 --> 03:41:37,600
He listens to how to get mushy, mushy and something, like
protein all day.

3564
03:41:38,240 --> 03:41:40,800
Only eats chicken and rice, nothing else.

3565
03:41:41,440 --> 03:41:45,320
Like the Kiga chat meme in itself, kind of.

3566
03:41:46,740 --> 03:41:48,580
Like, actually, and then he wakes up at 6 a.m.

3567
03:41:48,640 --> 03:41:49,120
That's him.

3568
03:41:49,620 --> 03:41:50,060
That's him.

3569
03:41:50,880 --> 03:41:51,680
I see, I see.

3570
03:41:51,800 --> 03:42:00,720
that oh my food i'm so he's an actual giga chad i was gonna
go back guys yeah he is he is i've seen it he has muscles

3571
03:42:00,720 --> 03:42:14,700
it's true more than me but it's okay you know i have the
brain it's a complication yeah the steam plays dive by the

3572
03:42:14,700 --> 03:42:24,180
way i'm pretty sure i think the steam played against terra's
team right i think the diamond no i think surely i just

3573
03:42:24,180 --> 03:42:34,660
banned standard things should we just go widow for the vibe

tank yeah we can build it like this triple tank really i

3575
03:42:41,920 --> 03:42:52,700
think we practice i don't want to give up on the dive i
don't want to i don't want to I'll show you after.

3576
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:53,620
I'll show you after.

3577
03:42:54,580 --> 03:42:56,220
Like Deadpool Venom Dive?

3578
03:42:56,720 --> 03:42:59,680
I don't know about Venom Cap though.

3579
03:42:59,820 --> 03:43:02,460
I like- Let it go!

3580
03:43:02,520 --> 03:43:04,540
I like Dive with a frontline tank.

3581
03:43:05,260 --> 03:43:06,500
And then one dive tank.

3582
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:08,500
Let it go.

3583
03:43:11,720 --> 03:43:14,640
Bro, bro, he's forcing dive.

3584
03:43:15,220 --> 03:43:20,720
I have to like nine- Like- All of us can't trust me please.

3585
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:28,900
We can't- yeah we just spent lucky we were to try four dive
triple triple triple triple we're gonna play triple mantis

3586
03:43:28,900 --> 03:43:39,060
mantis in this they've been bucky as well wait mantis in his
what i'm not the type mantis in this triple with loki no

3587
03:43:39,060 --> 03:43:54,040
wolf i think wolf no or name or solo whatever yeah name was
fine wolf is also fine I think wolf is better to be honest

3588
03:43:54,040 --> 03:43:59,880
for punish options Like i i ironically think in this case
crook.

3589
03:44:00,160 --> 03:44:03,940
It's better if i go What's called deadpool?

3590
03:44:04,440 --> 03:44:18,580
I'm fine playing this too Gotta gotta hit some Groot shit
Good jump back playing triple Yeah, of course I am happy to

3591
03:44:18,580 --> 03:44:25,220
see you too Can I go have Angela, they're gonna have Wolf,
most likely.

3592
03:44:25,340 --> 03:44:27,280
I think we go high on first fight.

3593
03:44:28,580 --> 03:44:30,600
Yeah, stop from high.

3594
03:44:31,140 --> 03:44:32,820
Against Angela, Doki Bird, you need to lock in.

3595
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:34,940
You need to try to keep your shift and keep your pull.

3596
03:44:35,860 --> 03:44:39,780
So when the Angela's above us, just shift inside of us, kind
of, so we don't get grabbed.

3597
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:41,120
Cancel this.

3598
03:44:41,860 --> 03:44:42,300
Got it?

3599
03:44:46,520 --> 03:44:47,720
It's very hard for him to move there.

3600
03:44:47,880 --> 03:44:48,420
Come top, come top.

3601
03:44:48,480 --> 03:44:48,980
Go top, go top.

3602
03:44:49,940 --> 03:44:50,740
DP careful.

3603
03:44:50,900 --> 03:44:51,180
Yeah, maybe.

3604
03:44:51,540 --> 03:44:52,480
Very likely actually.

3605
03:44:53,840 --> 03:44:55,240
These guys look like they want to chase.

3606
03:44:55,440 --> 03:44:55,880
Not DP.

3607
03:44:56,180 --> 03:44:58,160
They're triple DPS, BP Moon Knights.

3608
03:44:58,740 --> 03:45:00,020
Play the hype.

3609
03:45:01,280 --> 03:45:01,720
Wait a second.

3610
03:45:01,940 --> 03:45:02,920
We can walk forward soon.

3611
03:45:03,180 --> 03:45:04,240
Yeah, take all the map.

3612
03:45:04,580 --> 03:45:05,000
There's a roof.

3613
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:05,700
There's a roof here.

3614
03:45:05,860 --> 03:45:06,340
Roof here.

3615
03:45:06,640 --> 03:45:07,100
I pulled him back.

3616
03:45:07,500 --> 03:45:07,700
I pulled him back.

3617
03:45:07,740 --> 03:45:08,020
Roof.

3618
03:45:08,140 --> 03:45:08,680
You're passive.

3619
03:45:08,960 --> 03:45:09,300
Rock forward.

3620
03:45:09,580 --> 03:45:09,740
Rock forward.

3621
03:45:11,260 --> 03:45:12,060
Rock forward.

3622
03:45:12,100 --> 03:45:12,760
Just walk forward.

3623
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:13,600
I got you.

3624
03:45:13,680 --> 03:45:14,060
I got you.

3625
03:45:14,100 --> 03:45:14,160
I got you.

3626
03:45:14,200 --> 03:45:14,520
I'm one.

3627
03:45:14,920 --> 03:45:15,260
I'm dying.

3628
03:45:15,420 --> 03:45:15,560
I'm dying.

3629
03:45:19,620 --> 03:45:21,700
Look on the left, look on the left on me.

3630
03:45:22,640 --> 03:45:23,360
No fade.

3631
03:45:23,620 --> 03:45:24,660
I'm floating back.

3632
03:45:25,280 --> 03:45:26,400
There's a BP on me.

3633
03:45:27,260 --> 03:45:29,760
Try to keep me damage boosted at all times, by the way.

3634
03:45:30,500 --> 03:45:31,540
I do a lot of damage then.

3635
03:45:31,980 --> 03:45:32,660
Yeah, I'm trying.

3636
03:45:34,580 --> 03:45:35,520
Just wait right now.

3637
03:45:35,960 --> 03:45:37,120
Build slowly to our point.

3638
03:45:37,780 --> 03:45:39,240
Guys, look at the wolf, okay, a lot.

3639
03:45:39,580 --> 03:45:41,660
It's our primary focus to look at the wolf.

3640
03:45:42,480 --> 03:45:46,100
Doki can look at the wolf and I can look at the wolf if it's
necessary.

3641
03:45:47,060 --> 03:45:47,500
Enemy wolf.

3642
03:45:47,880 --> 03:45:49,280
Guys, rock forward on the mag.

3643
03:45:49,920 --> 03:45:51,620
I pulled him back, I pulled Groot back.

3644
03:45:52,080 --> 03:45:52,980
We kill him, we kill him, we kill him.

3645
03:45:53,140 --> 03:45:53,340
Good pull.

3646
03:45:54,480 --> 03:45:54,800
Nice pull.

3647
03:45:55,300 --> 03:45:55,720
Play Lamps.

3648
03:45:56,720 --> 03:45:57,420
Yeah, we can keep walking.

3649
03:45:59,060 --> 03:46:02,940
I can ult this if- I double damage we should do.

3650
03:46:03,420 --> 03:46:04,160
I think just back.

3651
03:46:04,160 --> 03:46:04,460
I pulled him!

3652
03:46:04,460 --> 03:46:04,860
I pulled him.

3653
03:46:06,840 --> 03:46:07,900
Just wait, just wait.

3654
03:46:07,980 --> 03:46:08,300
Come back.

3655
03:46:08,680 --> 03:46:09,080
Play pointed.

3656
03:46:10,520 --> 03:46:11,800
It's fine to play slow and play pointed.

3657
03:46:11,940 --> 03:46:13,340
Yeah, go back, go back, go back.

3658
03:46:13,900 --> 03:46:15,020
We should play out our advantage.

3659
03:46:15,520 --> 03:46:16,580
We're going to have Cloak ult.

3660
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:18,640
When they're Cloak ult, we need to kite it, I think.

3661
03:46:19,600 --> 03:46:25,600
try to we can kill it snake case we can damage boost snake
case for killing cloacold okay when they're cloacold two

I almost have my wall.

3666
03:46:54,620 --> 03:46:55,300
I'm trying to get you.

3667
03:46:56,880 --> 03:46:57,320
Can you lift?

3668
03:46:57,460 --> 03:46:57,700
Can you lift?

3669
03:46:57,760 --> 03:46:57,980
Yeah, I will.

3670
03:46:58,020 --> 03:46:58,400
I can back.

3671
03:46:58,540 --> 03:46:59,060
I have my ult.

3672
03:46:59,440 --> 03:47:00,160
I pulled you.

3673
03:47:00,260 --> 03:47:00,440
I pulled you.

3674
03:47:00,820 --> 03:47:01,260
I pulled you.

3675
03:47:01,260 --> 03:47:01,780
I pulled your back.

3676
03:47:01,980 --> 03:47:02,320
Get ready.

3677
03:47:02,860 --> 03:47:04,560
Three, two, one.

3678
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:05,540
It's thick.

3679
03:47:06,600 --> 03:47:07,160
Very big.

3680
03:47:09,380 --> 03:47:10,260
Wait, wait, wait.

3681
03:47:10,320 --> 03:47:11,120
What are you doing, bro?

3682
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:13,900
I swear you what?

3683
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:14,940
What happened?

3684
03:47:15,280 --> 03:47:16,020
He hit the wall.

3685
03:47:16,440 --> 03:47:17,080
I have one.

3686
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:17,920
No, no, no.

3687
03:47:18,380 --> 03:47:18,580
No.

3688
03:47:18,640 --> 03:47:19,000
No.

3689
03:47:19,700 --> 03:47:21,400
I don't know where that went.

3690
03:47:21,560 --> 03:47:22,440
I go Angela now.

3691
03:47:22,600 --> 03:47:24,040
I think I take them off the map here.

3692
03:47:24,160 --> 03:47:24,400
Yeah.

3693
03:47:24,560 --> 03:47:25,680
They only have two tanks.

3694
03:47:26,140 --> 03:47:27,980
You can give me damage boosts.

3695
03:47:28,040 --> 03:47:28,080
Yeah.

3696
03:47:29,140 --> 03:47:29,860
Wait, wait, wait.

3697
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:32,460
I pushed the Hawkeye with you.

3698
03:47:32,540 --> 03:47:33,060
Yeah, I'm walking.

3699
03:47:33,320 --> 03:47:33,340
Let's see.

3700
03:47:33,780 --> 03:47:34,360
Yeah, I can go.

3701
03:47:34,880 --> 03:47:35,100
Ready?

3702
03:47:35,100 --> 03:47:35,760
Three, two.

3703
03:47:35,860 --> 03:47:36,240
I pulled him back.

3704
03:47:38,300 --> 03:47:38,940
Hold on.

3705
03:47:38,940 --> 03:47:39,860
I'm trying to give you a damage boost.

3706
03:47:40,220 --> 03:47:40,800
I pushed the moon net.

3707
03:47:40,860 --> 03:47:41,200
Pretty close.

3708
03:47:41,440 --> 03:47:41,480
Ready?

3709
03:47:42,220 --> 03:47:44,300
You want to push it with my altar or no?

3710
03:47:44,620 --> 03:47:45,300
Push your people points.

3711
03:47:45,580 --> 03:47:46,520
No, they're going to cloak wounds.

3712
03:47:46,740 --> 03:47:46,940
Okay.

3713
03:47:47,440 --> 03:47:48,220
I'll match them.

3714
03:47:48,380 --> 03:47:49,100
Can you left team?

3715
03:47:50,080 --> 03:48:12,440
oh big i think we tried life treated like a practice i think
we tried it like a practice i think as hard as it sounds

3716
03:48:12,440 --> 03:48:18,000
it's definitely gonna work i mean otherwise we have to wait
five years again but it's fine i mean we can also these

3717
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:19,360
practice your soldiers

3718
03:48:22,580 --> 03:48:24,020
I mean, it's sad.

3719
03:48:25,340 --> 03:48:25,880
Super unlucky.

3720
03:48:27,700 --> 03:48:30,000
I mean, they're going to play they're going to end up
playing these teams anyways.

3721
03:48:30,260 --> 03:48:30,700
So it's like.

3722
03:48:31,660 --> 03:48:38,860
Yeah, it's super unlucky because normally they just wanted
to play a bit, you know, so it's like early these kind of

3723
03:48:38,860 --> 03:48:39,740
games are like annoying.

3724
03:48:40,560 --> 03:48:41,380
Thanks for the offer.

3725
03:48:41,920 --> 03:48:42,740
I mean, it's a fun tournament.

3726
03:48:43,020 --> 03:48:45,180
Like this is more of a fun tournament than a 40k tournament.

3727
03:48:45,460 --> 03:48:46,160
As hard as it sounds.

3728
03:48:47,140 --> 03:48:49,180
Less money on the mine is still money on the line,

3729
03:48:53,880 --> 03:48:55,100
We need the money, though.

3730
03:48:55,380 --> 03:48:55,840
I want the money.

3731
03:48:56,100 --> 03:48:56,660
We lock in.

3732
03:48:57,540 --> 03:48:58,360
Yeah, we do need the money.

3733
03:48:59,200 --> 03:48:59,300

3738
03:49:04,560 --> 03:49:05,140
Doki needs it.

3739
03:49:05,160 --> 03:49:05,520

3747
03:49:18,860 --> 03:49:19,400

Wait, what are you talking about?

3759
03:50:01,060 --> 03:50:02,040
No, they're like double.

3760
03:50:02,920 --> 03:50:04,560
Yeah, I kind of made the wrong call.

3761
03:50:05,120 --> 03:50:07,240
I have like an issue with that, honestly.

3762
03:50:07,460 --> 03:50:08,020
I have that a lot.

3763
03:50:09,400 --> 03:50:10,860

They have Cloak, no fade.

3773
03:50:24,920 --> 03:50:25,580
I'm shooting Cloak.

3774
03:50:25,820 --> 03:50:26,780
I'm on Groot.

3775
03:50:28,220 --> 03:50:28,720
Groot, Groot, Groot.

3776
03:50:28,720 --> 03:50:29,020
Groot, Groot, Groot.

3777
03:50:31,900 --> 03:50:35,040
I can't take the selfie.

3778
03:50:36,160 --> 03:50:37,160
I got it, I got it.

3779
03:50:37,160 --> 03:50:38,480
Oh, I did it.

3780
03:50:38,740 --> 03:50:40,960
He chased, he chased, he chased.

3781
03:50:41,480 --> 03:50:42,360
He's all the way on the left.

3782
03:50:43,420 --> 03:50:43,780
Right there.

3783
03:50:44,200 --> 03:50:45,540
He's one, he's one on the high.

3784
03:50:45,840 --> 03:50:46,700
Kill him, kill him, kill him quick.

3785
03:50:46,820 --> 03:50:47,500
He's primal rage.

3786
03:50:48,140 --> 03:50:48,880
He dies, he dies, he dies.

3787
03:50:50,520 --> 03:50:51,860
I can't kill him.

3788
03:50:51,920 --> 03:50:52,380
It's fine, it's fine.

3789
03:50:52,460 --> 03:50:53,300
Lift him.

3790
03:50:53,300 --> 03:50:55,320
I hit after, I hit after.

3791
03:50:55,460 --> 03:50:55,940
Can I get you?

3792
03:50:56,680 --> 03:50:58,300
You damage me before I go.

3793
03:50:59,900 --> 03:51:00,640
I'm going, I'm going.

3794
03:51:00,720 --> 03:51:01,660
I'm with you, I'm with you, trust me.

3795
03:51:01,700 --> 03:51:03,020
They're gonna cloak up, they're gonna cloak up.

3796
03:51:05,180 --> 03:51:07,260
Oh, I have fucking shit.

3797
03:51:07,940 --> 03:51:10,040
Ooh, he's one.

3798
03:51:13,620 --> 03:51:15,960
Wait, that team up is OP.

3799
03:51:16,640 --> 03:51:17,300
Holy shit.

3800
03:51:20,940 --> 03:51:21,720
They're not cocoa.

3801
03:51:23,140 --> 03:51:25,580
I think they had it earlier.

3802
03:51:27,600 --> 03:51:28,140
Just raid.

3803
03:51:28,280 --> 03:51:29,580
Coming up.

3804
03:51:33,150 --> 03:51:33,870
Just raid, just raid.

3805
03:51:34,030 --> 03:51:34,390
Come back.

3806
03:51:35,770 --> 03:51:35,810
Okay.

3807
03:51:35,970 --> 03:51:36,770
And then the spawn.

3808
03:51:37,870 --> 03:51:39,050
Yeah, I mean, you can push them.

3809
03:51:39,450 --> 03:51:40,070
Yeah, I'm pushing.

3810
03:51:41,170 --> 03:51:42,210
I never miss.

3811
03:51:43,910 --> 03:51:44,970
Clear the way.

3812
03:51:45,430 --> 03:51:46,710
I pulled somebody back.

3813
03:51:51,600 --> 03:51:52,460
Oh, good.

3814
03:51:54,600 --> 03:51:56,280
Oh, Doug is dead.

3815
03:51:57,840 --> 03:51:58,480
I'm with you.

3816
03:51:58,540 --> 03:51:59,780
You damage, Bruce.

3817
03:52:00,760 --> 03:52:01,840
He's trying to.

3818
03:52:02,060 --> 03:52:02,680
He's trying to cap.

3819
03:52:03,280 --> 03:52:04,300
Hulk's going to see nine, guys.

3820
03:52:04,660 --> 03:52:07,140
I pulled him back, but yet isn't.

3821
03:52:07,280 --> 03:52:08,920
Bro, DD is so OP.

3822
03:52:09,440 --> 03:52:11,620
What the fuck?

3823
03:52:12,660 --> 03:52:13,780
Yeah, they see you.

3824
03:52:13,780 --> 03:52:14,260
They just won.

3825
03:52:15,280 --> 03:52:16,680
They see you, Crook.

3826
03:52:18,020 --> 03:52:18,640
Can we kill Drew?

3827
03:52:18,880 --> 03:52:19,300
Do you have wood?

3828
03:52:19,800 --> 03:52:20,340
No, that's okay.

3829
03:52:20,960 --> 03:52:22,740
Three, two, one.

3830
03:52:23,780 --> 03:52:24,300
Oh, is it?

3831
03:52:25,120 --> 03:52:26,080
Focus on the view.

3832
03:52:26,180 --> 03:52:27,120
Oh shit, okay.

3833
03:52:27,520 --> 03:52:28,240
I can shoot him with you.

3834
03:52:28,320 --> 03:52:29,700
I can shoot him with you.

3835
03:52:29,760 --> 03:52:29,980
Duh.

3836
03:52:30,180 --> 03:52:30,740
Yeah, nice.

3837
03:52:31,280 --> 03:52:31,680
Invis?

3838
03:52:32,380 --> 03:52:33,040
I'm shooting Invis.

3839
03:52:33,900 --> 03:52:34,780
Wow, DD on me.

3840
03:52:35,800 --> 03:52:37,320
I'm on cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

3841
03:52:37,420 --> 03:52:37,880
On bottom right.

3842
03:52:38,300 --> 03:52:39,120
Can I see one?

3843
03:52:39,420 --> 03:52:40,180
I killed him though.

3844
03:52:40,300 --> 03:52:40,680
A chain.

3845
03:52:42,420 --> 03:52:42,960
One could go.

3846
03:52:43,160 --> 03:52:46,500
Good game.

3847
03:52:51,520 --> 03:52:52,560
Didn't have a leg yet.

3848
03:52:52,960 --> 03:52:53,740
Maybe it helped.

3849
03:52:54,100 --> 03:52:55,980
I didn't have a leg yet.

3850
03:52:56,080 --> 03:52:56,800
Maybe it helped.

3851
03:52:56,800 --> 03:52:58,820
I changed, I prioritized my PC.

3852
03:52:59,220 --> 03:53:00,560
Maybe that would help with the rest.

3853
03:53:01,140 --> 03:53:02,100
I didn't try that yet.

3854
03:53:02,340 --> 03:53:04,480
I'm eating my chicken nuggets while I'm playing quick there.

3855
03:53:04,740 --> 03:53:08,860
Maybe it was an issue because I had the telephones
prioritized for some reason.

3856
03:53:10,180 --> 03:53:10,560
No.

3857
03:53:11,240 --> 03:53:13,320
It's really quick play right now.

3858
03:53:21,920 --> 03:53:23,020
Oh, you got them DD.

3859
03:53:23,660 --> 03:53:24,480
So, daredevil.

hey guys if we play more game that would mean we if we play

3867

3872
03:55:33,580 --> 03:55:34,180
See, this is the problem.

3873
03:55:34,340 --> 03:55:35,380
Someone said, go Spider-Man.

3874
03:55:35,800 --> 03:55:37,100
Honestly, not a bad idea.

3875
03:55:38,860 --> 03:55:39,880
It's not the map for...

3876
03:55:39,880 --> 03:55:41,320
Maybe it is the map for it.

3877
03:55:41,500 --> 03:55:42,760
I've been playing Spider-Man here.

3878
03:55:43,380 --> 03:55:44,400
I actually know a rollout.

3879
03:55:44,900 --> 03:55:45,660
Can I try it?

3880
03:55:45,740 --> 03:55:47,800
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

3881
03:55:48,720 --> 03:55:51,460
Honestly, they're diamond players, so I think you can.

3882
03:55:51,680 --> 03:55:52,800

No, we lost.

3893
03:56:41,400 --> 03:56:42,500
Nothing to play anymore.

3894
03:56:43,480 --> 03:56:44,620
They paid for it, but not the ad.

3895
03:56:44,800 --> 03:56:45,320
I was on Jeff.

3896
03:56:45,400 --> 03:56:47,520
I'm not looking forward to it when it wasn't on my radar
before.

3897
03:56:47,720 --> 03:56:47,840
Definitely.

3898
03:56:47,960 --> 03:56:48,780

03:56:52,500 --> 03:56:54,000
Oh, they did pay for the ad.

3903
03:56:54,280 --> 03:56:56,620
Oh, not where the placement is.

3904
03:56:57,560 --> 03:57:00,480
But, like, even after he's been, like, talking about it.

3905
03:57:00,500 --> 03:57:10,000
about it hey why was there no vans because there's a creator
tournament it was a creator tournament a lot of one tricks

3906
03:57:10,000 --> 03:57:15,440
were invited to it so they didn't want people to get their
one tricks bad there's like no prize pool whenever they

3907
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:26,140
invited people like me included the 40k was a surprise yeah
i forgot the scrim was against you right yeah i was in that

3908

same i see anyone doing boker bash i was gonna say how did

up for it but you're invited trust me uh i mess okay uh this

3911
03:57:52,960 --> 03:58:01,020
is funny okay basically i messaged boker today right on the
toilet i messaged him and he said he said i i am i in

3912
03:58:01,020 --> 03:58:07,180
bogabash or nah and he said you are in you are i haven't
went through the list but i will invite you for sure good

3913
03:58:07,180 --> 03:58:17,340
vibes and i said w vibes so i think we and gluca are in uh i
think all of navi are in no the captains are content

3914
03:58:17,340 --> 03:58:23,260
creators because booger was like asking me if i want to be a
captain i was like no i see because i didn't really want to

3915
03:58:23,260 --> 03:58:29,660
do the cc i was scared of the cc drama so because i just
didn't want accountability for stuff so But he was like, no,

3916
03:58:29,880 --> 03:58:32,180
all the content creators are captains this time.

3917
03:58:32,580 --> 03:58:34,100
So it's like Flats is captain.

3918
03:58:36,400 --> 03:58:37,680
And what was it?

3919
03:58:37,740 --> 03:58:38,700
He gave me two people.

3920
03:58:38,800 --> 03:58:40,040
It was like Flats and someone else.

3921
03:58:40,180 --> 03:58:41,500
And he's like, so it'll be chill.

3922
03:58:42,260 --> 03:58:47,540
And he said like, he's going to assign two pros to like each
content creator.

3923
03:58:47,760 --> 03:58:49,240
And then the pros will draft the rest.

3924
03:58:50,500 --> 03:58:51,060
Oh, really?

3925
03:58:51,180 --> 03:58:51,460
Yeah.

3926
03:58:51,600 --> 03:58:53,600
So it is more pro-oriented.

3927
03:58:54,020 --> 03:58:56,220
So like each content creator gets two pros.

3928
03:58:56,560 --> 03:58:57,900
So it's like, yeah.

3929
03:58:58,780 --> 03:59:00,000
I think that's more balanced.

3930
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:01,580
Yeah, I think that's...

3931
03:59:01,580 --> 03:59:04,880
So like, I'm technically a captain on the Bouguer Bash too.

3932
03:59:04,880 --> 03:59:06,440
Did you use the last turn yet as an example?

3933
03:59:07,380 --> 03:59:07,780
Yeah, yeah.

3934
03:59:08,440 --> 03:59:09,960
But I didn't play the last Bouguer Bash.

3935
03:59:10,280 --> 03:59:12,160
I was not invited in the Christmas Clash, I think.

3936
03:59:13,240 --> 03:59:13,620
No good.

3937
03:59:13,720 --> 03:59:14,160
That's...

3938
03:59:14,160 --> 03:59:16,180
No, the Christmas Clash was not...

3939
03:59:16,180 --> 03:59:17,840
It was like not the best.

3940
03:59:20,280 --> 03:59:22,000
It was really scuff.

3941
03:59:22,600 --> 03:59:23,340
It's on Thor.

3942
03:59:26,120 --> 03:59:27,860
I believe in your Spider-Man, trust me.

3943
03:59:29,380 --> 03:59:29,900
Oh,

3944
03:59:34,320 --> 03:59:34,900
I can hit him.

3945
03:59:35,940 --> 03:59:42,560
I can put someone in us.

3946
03:59:42,820 --> 03:59:44,180
Let's wait.

3947
03:59:44,420 --> 03:59:44,840
Get ready.

3948
03:59:48,260 --> 03:59:49,340
Can we kill Invis?

3949
03:59:51,580 --> 03:59:53,280
I blinded the two things.

3950
03:59:53,600 --> 03:59:54,120
What about magic?

3951
03:59:54,360 --> 03:59:54,780
Magic wanted.

3952
03:59:56,400 --> 03:59:57,100
I killed one.

3953
03:59:57,260 --> 03:59:58,040
But okay.

3954
03:59:58,640 --> 03:59:59,660
I really pushed by the door.

3955
04:00:00,220 --> 04:00:01,340
I got you.

3956
04:00:01,900 --> 04:00:02,560
Stay in the sphere.

3957
04:00:02,800 --> 04:00:04,000
Just wait, just wait, just wait.

3958
04:00:04,620 --> 04:00:05,540
I blinded the tank.

3959
04:00:05,680 --> 04:00:06,260
I blinded Thor.

3960
04:00:06,720 --> 04:00:07,460
Nice blind.

3961
04:00:09,920 --> 04:00:10,680
Second two.

3962
04:00:13,800 --> 04:00:15,520
I still have the lag right there.

3963
04:00:15,700 --> 04:00:16,720
I had it like earlier.

3964
04:00:16,940 --> 04:00:17,480
It's not good.

3965
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:18,540
There's a magic.

3966
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:19,940
Are you rubber banding?

3967
04:00:21,080 --> 04:00:24,480
No, like every 10 minutes I have like a DC.

3968
04:00:25,300 --> 04:00:26,060
That's not good.

3969
04:00:26,640 --> 04:00:28,080
Like one second DC.

3970
04:00:28,880 --> 04:00:29,300
Here you might.

3971
04:00:31,180 --> 04:00:32,440
Does it affect your stream at all?

3972
04:00:33,760 --> 04:00:35,320
I mean, it affects everything.

3973
04:00:35,500 --> 04:00:36,840
It affects my stream, my game.

3974
04:00:37,340 --> 04:00:40,220
But it like, the stream doesn't crash, but it's like...

3975
04:00:40,760 --> 04:00:41,320
Yeah, I know.

3976
04:00:42,480 --> 04:00:43,700
Like it's annoying.

3977
04:00:44,840 --> 04:00:45,540
Just chill, just chill.

3978
04:00:46,000 --> 04:00:47,380
4-1, 4-1.

3979
04:00:51,120 --> 04:00:51,880
Walk up, hold it.

3980
04:00:52,320 --> 04:00:53,400
I want triple now.

3981
04:00:53,540 --> 04:00:54,440
I want to hold it, I want to.

3982
04:00:55,980 --> 04:00:56,700
Okay, I can.

3983
04:00:58,340 --> 04:00:59,500
Need to hop in, need to hop in.

3984
04:00:59,620 --> 04:01:00,440
I'm cutting, I'm cutting.

3985
04:01:02,260 --> 04:01:02,900
I'm blinded.

3986
04:01:03,020 --> 04:01:03,520
Can we force in this?

3987
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:04,040
I could all.

3988
04:01:05,300 --> 04:01:05,880
I can E again.

3989
04:01:06,140 --> 04:01:07,240
Two, one, one.

3990
04:01:08,640 --> 04:01:09,300
Let me try to shoot.

3991
04:01:09,520 --> 04:01:10,860
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky behind, Bucky behind.

3992
04:01:11,060 --> 04:01:11,080
One.

3993
04:01:11,420 --> 04:01:11,880
Bucky behind.

3994
04:01:12,000 --> 04:01:12,520
I'm offering this.

3995
04:01:12,820 --> 04:01:13,780
Well, I think we win.

3996
04:01:14,920 --> 04:01:15,500
I think I'll die.

3997
04:01:16,840 --> 04:01:17,780
Mac on point, Mac on point.

3998
04:01:18,760 --> 04:01:20,440
Okay, can we push into them with Cloak ult here?

3999
04:01:20,800 --> 04:01:20,960
Yeah.

4000
04:01:21,280 --> 04:01:22,680
I think this is very good play early on.

4001
04:01:22,760 --> 04:01:23,160
You can heal.

4002
04:01:23,280 --> 04:01:24,260
They have nothing to respond.

4003
04:01:24,340 --> 04:01:26,000
They only have Invisal then we can kill through.

4004
04:01:26,960 --> 04:01:28,540
Yeah, I'm top left right now.

4005
04:01:28,800 --> 04:01:29,260
Call you.

4006
04:01:29,380 --> 04:01:30,480
Call you blind, okay, Doki?

4007
04:01:30,620 --> 04:01:31,720
I have my bubble for you.

4008
04:01:31,880 --> 04:01:33,260
You want me to do now?

4009
04:01:33,340 --> 04:01:34,180
We're going in right now.

4010
04:01:34,320 --> 04:01:35,020
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4011
04:01:35,080 --> 04:01:35,420
We can go.

4012
04:01:36,240 --> 04:01:36,460
Okay.

4013
04:01:36,780 --> 04:01:37,420
Oh, sorry.

4014
04:01:37,760 --> 04:01:39,620
He said ready, so I thought that was it.

4015
04:01:39,700 --> 04:01:41,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

4016
04:01:41,780 --> 04:01:42,820
Can you invest, invest, invest, invest.

4017
04:01:43,020 --> 04:01:43,840
I blinded them.

4018
04:01:44,000 --> 04:01:46,920
I blinded Thor again.

4019
04:01:47,860 --> 04:01:48,700
Yeah, click blind.

4020
04:01:49,120 --> 04:01:49,540
He has two blinds?

4021
04:01:49,820 --> 04:01:50,640
They have W blunts.

4022
04:01:51,800 --> 04:01:54,320
There's Adam on points instead, I think.

4023
04:01:55,040 --> 04:01:55,820
Stretch him on points.

4024
04:01:56,620 --> 04:01:56,820

Yeah, they get an easier team.

4045
04:03:31,210 --> 04:03:32,370
That's the Swiss system.

4046
04:03:32,610 --> 04:03:43,370
At least they can play which things up including which side
you're on you'll need a top-notch team to win this one we

4047
04:03:43,370 --> 04:03:49,810
are cloak and dagger we are hope and fear we're

4048
04:03:53,580 --> 04:04:03,680

our second match was like one of the best teams in the

4051
04:04:22,520 --> 04:04:31,100
tournament that's how unlucky it was that we got that like
there's this system is like you can have like teams that

4052
04:04:31,100 --> 04:04:37,380

4223
04:14:08,370 --> 04:14:11,870
That is a tool, a painting tool, for showing what I mean.

4224
04:14:12,570 --> 04:14:14,650
We're 2-1 right now.

4225
04:14:15,330 --> 04:14:16,850
Girls, what the fuck?

4226
04:14:16,990 --> 04:14:18,790
We have to disclose rotation.

4227
04:14:19,010 --> 04:14:19,850
We have to take this rotation.

4228
04:14:20,050 --> 04:14:20,370
We always start it.

4229
04:14:20,370 --> 04:14:21,430
We always start it.

4230
04:14:21,610 --> 04:14:21,870
You know?

4231
04:14:22,930 --> 04:14:23,730
That's what we start.

4232
04:14:24,890 --> 04:14:26,890
We always start the party.

4233
04:14:26,910 --> 04:14:30,790
What do you want about, I think, all of the Jala, I want to
quickly go over the attack.

4234
04:14:32,170 --> 04:14:36,650
The attack, so many situations, they are giving the map
space, but we need to take it.

4235
04:14:37,450 --> 04:14:42,050
Very important, and this is something that I need us to
understand.

4236
04:14:43,490 --> 04:14:45,470
Let me know if you guys are ready for it too.

4237
04:14:46,050 --> 04:14:47,890
I don't know how Doki, if Doki won't.

4238
04:14:48,370 --> 04:14:50,110
Don't have to stream, you can also play ranked Doki.

4239
04:14:50,210 --> 04:14:51,050
No, I'm watching.

4240
04:14:51,130 --> 04:14:52,390
If you think it's not good content for you.

4241
04:14:52,690 --> 04:15:11,850
you need to do this or whatever then you don't need to you
don't need to but professor e professor no we're in class

4242
04:15:11,850 --> 04:15:19,910
right now right regardless of if we are in class or not um
their matchup itself they heavily rely on two things they're

4243
04:15:19,910 --> 04:15:27,810
venom to clear angles with the mag and they are able to play
set angle right generally speaking if we all go top and we

4244
04:15:27,810 --> 04:15:36,030
all force main the opportunity will be created we have two
resources that are great for us we have Pierce healing with

4245
04:15:36,030 --> 04:15:42,290
Raccoon and Pierce healing with Invis both of the healings
we receive from them have aoe effect which means we get

4246
04:15:42,290 --> 04:15:48,570
double the value if we stack around the resources you know
if we split around the resources and we play angles right

4247
04:15:48,570 --> 04:15:56,190
now there's no real value in that so we right now and play
in maine we should be able to take away their resources in

4248
04:15:56,190 --> 04:16:03,610
maine by winning the trades in maine so that's why it's okay
to stack and go top all together right now once we walk out

4249
04:16:04,750 --> 04:16:14,170
very important is to put pressure on this yeah what's up can
we look at my penny mine kill later yeah i mean i saw it

4250
04:16:14,170 --> 04:16:19,130
it's it's earlier here thank you it's good he just he just
idled Wait, where did they land?

4251
04:16:19,230 --> 04:16:19,850
I want to see you again?

4252
04:16:20,650 --> 04:16:21,730
They landed like the first.

4253
04:16:21,930 --> 04:16:28,170
You could have seen it, but but he just like I think he just
AF played in the brain.

4254
04:16:30,610 --> 04:16:31,670
Now besides the point, right?

4255
04:16:31,870 --> 04:16:32,750
The point is still the same.

4256
04:16:33,290 --> 04:16:34,210
We had a good position.

4257
04:16:34,570 --> 04:16:35,610
We forced off the high ground.

4258
04:16:35,750 --> 04:16:36,710
They can't really hold it.

4259
04:16:37,070 --> 04:16:38,730
And then the question is how we take after.

4260
04:16:39,630 --> 04:16:39,630
Right?

4261
04:16:39,970 --> 04:16:43,890
Because now this is a position where the fight should
theoretically be unloosable.

4262
04:16:44,690 --> 04:16:45,390
They have no squids.

4263
04:16:45,570 --> 04:16:46,390
They have no protection.

4264
04:16:46,870 --> 04:16:48,350
All we need to do is Snakehase needs to walk there.

4265
04:16:48,370 --> 04:16:48,670
main.

4266
04:16:49,070 --> 04:16:52,590
A lot of the time, Snakehaves, you're very hesitant on
taking space.

4267
04:16:53,370 --> 04:16:58,890
Usually when we have Invis and Rocket, it's very hard for
them to put counter pressure on our backline, so it's okay

4268
04:16:58,890 --> 04:17:01,450
to walk into space once certain areas are cleared.

4269
04:17:01,790 --> 04:17:07,150
Like the Venom is cleared in the sense of him having no E
cooldown, so it's very hard for him to engage right now, and

4270
04:17:07,150 --> 04:17:08,390
we also clear this area.

4271
04:17:08,850 --> 04:17:12,030
So he can counter slam you, so you can't really lose
cooldowns in main.

4272
04:17:12,590 --> 04:17:16,650
I already want to go since I see my name or hit, but you're
lacking behind.

4273
04:17:16,950 --> 04:17:24,530
So this costs us two seconds of pressure and once more we're
in this situation where we have too many people that are

4274
04:17:24,530 --> 04:17:31,230
inactive in a sense of not doing enough pressure here it's a
similar thing with duck look at the position you take your

4275
04:17:31,230 --> 04:17:39,470
position is really bad because the only thing it does for us
is it forces either dokeybird or crook to look to the side

4276
04:17:39,470 --> 04:17:45,610
which we don't want right we want to use the aoe healing to
push down this line and by pushing down the line the

4277
04:17:45,610 --> 04:17:51,850
objective is that you can take Because then once we both
take the high ground, they can never take it back, which

4278
04:17:51,850 --> 04:17:54,950
puts immense pressure on the killbox over here, which we
need to have.

4279
04:17:55,530 --> 04:18:02,030
Eventually, we need to make sure, and this is whatever we
play, whenever we play, wherever we play, even if the enemy

4280
04:18:02,030 --> 04:18:09,730
plays inside the room, we need to have some kind of idea to
develop our entire team to this position or to develop the

4281
04:18:09,730 --> 04:18:14,190
damage from our team to this position to create
opportunities to wipe the fight.

4282
04:18:14,650 --> 04:18:16,410
So what do you want to play it?

4283
04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:20,090
on what resources we have right now.

4284
04:18:20,370 --> 04:18:25,730
Right now, there's no reason for you to play over here, and
it would be way more reason to play in main and just play

4285
04:18:25,730 --> 04:18:28,710
where Krook is on top, because you can't be contested.

4286
04:18:29,550 --> 04:18:34,870
There's no reason to not do it, because by playing it on off
angle, if you take damage, you would force the resources

4287
04:18:34,870 --> 04:18:40,430
away from us, which would prevent me and Snake Case to keep
closing the distance there, which ultimately leads to us

4288
04:18:40,430 --> 04:18:42,570
having more space on the map, which we want, right?

4289
04:18:42,630 --> 04:18:43,250
I'm learning.

4290
04:18:44,510 --> 04:18:50,690
So this end up happening, you end up being low, Krook has to
turn for you, so you like once more look at what happened

4291
04:18:50,690 --> 04:18:57,110
now they can take the map space back which the result of
that is the people that are hitting right now are going to

4292
04:18:57,110 --> 04:19:02,370
be isolated because none of us are putting pressure in this
area anymore so they can put their attention to clearing

4293
04:19:02,370 --> 04:19:09,810
this guy so our hit is going to be gone so it takes us
longer to once more set a new hit right and this is all

4294
04:19:09,810 --> 04:19:15,230
happening on the screen it happens it's okay you know we
still get a pick because the hit was really good the hit is

4295
04:19:15,230 --> 04:19:22,470
smart very good played by Argo here what happened afterwards
is illegal right because we this is a position where you

4296
04:19:22,470 --> 04:19:29,290
should never lose from right but you see what i mean right
because you keep fighting the venom in a position where we

4297
04:19:29,290 --> 04:19:35,550
don't have feelings to line up and snake is going for like
everyone shooting this guy we can never develop and clear

4298
04:19:35,550 --> 04:19:41,430
the fight quickly which we want right because obviously if
you stack with us here and everyone just walks down this

4299
04:19:41,430 --> 04:19:46,710
path they can't stop it even if the venom is there yeah we
can still kill him later, right?

4300
04:19:46,970 --> 04:19:48,470
And we forced point, he has to touch.

4301
04:19:48,910 --> 04:19:51,550
So now we kill him, but now we had zero development on the
map.

4302
04:19:52,070 --> 04:19:52,650
It's still fine.

4303
04:19:52,770 --> 04:19:54,290
Now we need to push main again, right?

4304
04:19:54,610 --> 04:19:57,270
It's okay to go bird on top here now, right?

4305
04:19:57,350 --> 04:19:58,670
They have nothing to stop it.

4306
04:19:59,250 --> 04:20:01,230
They have no people that can just fly up.

4307
04:20:01,710 --> 04:20:06,450
So it's okay to bird on top and for Krook to jump top too
and to create an opportunity where we can kill.

4308
04:20:07,390 --> 04:20:09,890
Unfortunately, we're not ready to do that, you know?

4309
04:20:10,730 --> 04:20:11,250
It's okay.

4310
04:20:11,650 --> 04:20:16,750
We have a decent enough hit, but you're not developing the
back line you're shooting the tanks right now which is not

4311
04:20:16,750 --> 04:20:23,610
the primarily win condition yeah i mean that you kill adam
would happen anyway look at what we have on the map there's

4312
04:20:23,610 --> 04:20:30,090
zero chance that we should lose here if you think about it
you know it right you you're a good player if you go top

4313
04:20:30,090 --> 04:20:36,630
here you have infinite opportunities you can get in the
shielded we get way more map control and the tp back is

4314
04:20:36,630 --> 04:20:43,530
going to be in a position where we have all angles to
control them with right additionally to that i don't like to

4315
04:20:43,530 --> 04:20:51,330
play high ground guys at the bare minimum you need to hit
the right people okay to be fair to be fair he's talking

4316
04:20:51,330 --> 04:20:58,330
about that or everybody but me right now and then when you
start talking about we all start crying position you need to

4317
04:20:58,330 --> 04:21:05,410
put them somewhere where they can hit them like over here
because you know where they're not judging me yet so the

4318
04:21:05,410 --> 04:21:11,150
people that are not bad they will pass inside repair myself
natural cover so when they have inside natural cover you

4319
04:21:11,150 --> 04:21:16,990
need to put them in a in a way that we can prevent them from
going into natural cover or you can pinch you gotta learn

4320
04:21:16,990 --> 04:21:17,970
not to cry

4321
04:21:21,970 --> 04:21:26,410
these are the two options that you can take right

4322
04:21:34,190 --> 04:21:39,330
it happens you know we clear the lamps unfortunately i have
to waste my entire ear to clean them and now this is the

4323
04:21:39,330 --> 04:21:44,830
position look at what happens here they have two people that
i contested there is zero chance if you don't drop here in

4324
04:21:44,830 --> 04:21:55,580
the backline that we kill these backlines look how long it
takes to kill the backline no one is shooting the backline

4325
04:21:55,580 --> 04:22:02,940
and this happened kind of every fight regardless of what
comp we're playing if we have phoenix there is a point in

4326
04:22:02,940 --> 04:22:08,520
the game where i need development on the backline duck
you're still in the same position shooting mate which isn't

4327
04:22:08,520 --> 04:22:15,520
too terrible because once more now you at least line up with
the of the players, but it's still not optimal.

4328
04:22:16,120 --> 04:22:23,400
The problem now arises, now that we don't have multiple
angles, they can just TP out for free, because our angle

4329
04:22:23,400 --> 04:22:24,420
game is gone.

4330
04:22:25,800 --> 04:22:30,980
Sad people in the back here are not dying, because we don't
play into them, right?

4331
04:22:31,020 --> 04:22:36,320
We need to drop here, SnakeHist needs to walk on them, which
definitely needed to happen, and you play too passive,

4332
04:22:37,140 --> 04:22:37,300
right?

4333
04:22:37,360 --> 04:22:38,320
Because there's no drawback.

4334
04:22:38,900 --> 04:22:40,280
There should be zero drawback to walk here.

4335
04:22:40,280 --> 04:22:42,620
We have infinite range healing with Reku's infinite range
healing.

4336
04:22:43,100 --> 04:22:45,880
And if you play Venom, you would always walk into that right
now.

4337
04:22:46,860 --> 04:22:49,820
So the general goal is to always cut the supply, right?

4338
04:22:50,220 --> 04:22:51,700
It's kind of illegal to lose this fight.

4339
04:22:51,720 --> 04:22:52,480
Are you guys thinking notes?

4340
04:22:52,980 --> 04:22:53,640
Because I'm not.

4341
04:22:53,780 --> 04:22:55,400
Yeah, I thought we were going to straight win.

4342
04:22:56,140 --> 04:22:57,720
Don't tell them that I'm not listening.

4343
04:22:58,080 --> 04:22:58,680
I'm listening.

4344
04:22:59,760 --> 04:23:02,400
Now my cooldowns are burned and I see that no one is pushing
with me.

4345
04:23:02,620 --> 04:23:03,220
So I need to wait.

4346
04:23:03,940 --> 04:23:05,900
I'm still waiting because I need to open fight them.

4347
04:23:06,380 --> 04:23:07,140
But now they get to copy.

4348
04:23:07,620 --> 04:23:08,800
And now they can turn the fight.

4349
04:23:09,040 --> 04:23:10,040
Now we have to wait.

4350
04:23:10,280 --> 04:23:19,600
right it's okay to i swear i'm listening but the most
definitely listening right we still gotta be able to hit

4351
04:23:19,600 --> 04:23:28,640
their backline properly and now i go i told you i told you i
literally like realize can i copy the notes off of you guys

4352
04:23:28,640 --> 04:23:37,440
later yeah it is it is kind of bad timing to go down now
regardless very important to shoot in this year right duck

4353
04:23:37,440 --> 04:23:42,580
takes a high ground position which makes you vulnerable but
like right now it makes you vulnerable because you use bird

4354
04:23:42,580 --> 04:23:47,980
for it if you had started on the high ground you can bird
away and bait attention to that now they can punish it by

4355
04:23:47,980 --> 04:23:56,700
flying up and showing you right so now we obviously want to
wait it's okay to play a bit slower now and waiting for an

4356
04:23:56,700 --> 04:24:04,640
opportunity but it's kind of sad that we end up dying
because we kind of are playing into the into the ult a bit

4357
04:24:04,640 --> 04:24:12,260
much and we lost all the the space for and all the pressure
we could have also played further up as i said like we

4358
04:24:12,260 --> 04:24:18,000
allowed the backline to kind of walk into open area when we
have like kella namo angle and we should always control them

4359
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:24,920
so it's it's it happens you know we need to go next slide
because the fight is lost now this is the position and here

4360
04:24:24,920 --> 04:24:32,040
this is what troop meant he meant you should go these rocks
you should go over here they can't do anything against this

4361
04:24:32,040 --> 04:24:43,920
oh my god he's actually like drawing diagrams on me all the
time no one is drawing on the thing you know but very

4362
04:24:43,920 --> 04:24:49,160
important it's still on doug it's not on me yet do not let
yourself get poked out then we're still rotating this

4363
04:24:49,160 --> 04:25:00,960
happens to rank it happens too often in the sense of i'm
still this thing is on doug it's not even on me what i'm

4364
04:25:00,960 --> 04:25:06,360
always doing is too aggressive though you know i think yeah
you actually have a white point it just doesn't line up with

4365
04:25:06,360 --> 04:25:14,240
the ideology that we want to about the aoe even but it's not
like you're a hella and but he's still on dog it's obviously

4366
04:25:15,380 --> 04:25:22,480
the idea is to have the long ls which makes up for the fact
that you normally take poke to win right but now that we

4367
04:25:22,480 --> 04:25:30,240
have a lot of it's because uh i went here because crook
saying someone needed the flank so that i just like did it

4368
04:25:30,240 --> 04:25:40,640
he's learning he's learning right now but that's why like
energy was ready yeah because uh energy new because after i

4369
04:25:40,640 --> 04:25:45,800
like did it the first time he just knew what path thing i
could go i mean it's kind of on me for taking the same path

4370
04:25:45,800 --> 04:25:52,340
thing though i should have changed it up maybe i go bottom
it's also fine to start mainly i think it just i mean as i

4371
04:25:52,340 --> 04:25:57,860
said we need to abuse the fact that we play around our
resource as well regardless of what resources we have

4372
04:25:57,860 --> 04:26:03,880
because that's a primary thing duck if you once again like
if you play bottom here and we have inverse raccoon and

4373
04:26:03,880 --> 04:26:10,160
everyone wants to line up here to put pressure here you
can't play here because a force maybe he's going one by one

4374
04:26:10,160 --> 04:26:19,260
and then next is ago and then next is maybe i'd be less
resources and the lunar raccoon resources were distributed

4375
04:26:19,260 --> 04:26:27,960
which we needed to distribute on top but properly what would
we do in that situation then against sarah like we can't

4376
04:26:27,960 --> 04:26:33,000
just let him sit up there for free and just poke the best
way the best way to stop it would probably to have our necro

4377
04:26:33,000 --> 04:26:39,560
guys did you hear about lego crafts bro i won't actually and
have tokybird line up the rocketeers by looking slightly

4378
04:26:39,560 --> 04:26:47,900
upwards towards you so we put more pressure on terror it's
the next best thing we need to force on top so that would be

4379
04:26:47,900 --> 04:26:54,980
the solution to stopping that next fight going into the next
fight because this fight is okay he mentioned me i looked i

4380
04:26:54,980 --> 04:27:01,480
looked guys so much you know we still get a normal fight the
next fight and we get actually good entry picks and a good

4381
04:27:01,480 --> 04:27:09,420
position to win because we uh we have a good flank here
going on and a good right this is what i what i mean right

4382
04:27:09,420 --> 04:27:16,320
if you come from the logs they should have like zero chance
to contest you this still gets value now duck what i don't

4383
04:27:16,320 --> 04:27:24,740
like is the fact that you don't take high ground here i
think you this ultimate example is is good at everything but

4384
04:27:24,740 --> 04:27:31,120
i think it's just too forced you know what i mean it's just
too early you should just wait because if they go back

4385
04:27:31,120 --> 04:27:38,780
further you still get to late later because now you just die
for it i'm pretty sure though Yeah, you die for it.

4386
04:27:38,800 --> 04:27:43,300
So this is like a death that is like super avoidable if you
just play a bit slower because none of us were ready to

4387
04:27:43,300 --> 04:27:44,240
walk, right?

4388
04:27:44,480 --> 04:27:49,220
For sure, we could have walked earlier and everything, but
we definitely needed to play slower.

4389
04:27:49,680 --> 04:27:52,340
Regardless, position is okay, right?

4390
04:27:53,280 --> 04:27:54,080
It happens.

4391
04:27:54,660 --> 04:27:56,320
We gotta wait a bit, we gotta play slow.

4392
04:27:56,700 --> 04:27:59,320
Once we have a normal fight, we can walk up.

4393
04:27:59,800 --> 04:28:03,300
The rocket ult, in this situation, Tokibert, it needs to be
deeper.

4394
04:28:03,860 --> 04:28:07,640
They don't have a lot to counter it, so you need to try to
get the rocket ult.

4395
04:28:07,660 --> 04:28:14,260
over here because what we need to accomplish is we need to
put pressure in this area okay and if the rocket is that far

4396
04:28:14,260 --> 04:28:19,800
away it's very hard to put pressure in this area because
eventually snake case you want to be able to walk here right

4397
04:28:19,800 --> 04:28:25,960
because you want to cut supply to the tanks this is why once
again your position is just off right yeah yeah your idea

4398
04:28:25,960 --> 04:28:31,240
should be to cut the supply to the tanks because our
backline should sustain itself or at least be able to

4399
04:28:31,240 --> 04:28:40,340
sustain it with the namoy angle so it ends up happening like
this they would like this it's all good you know we end up

4400
04:28:40,340 --> 04:28:48,700
they want me to all my rocket all further very important is
i would want to have more pressure on this area see it's the

4401
04:28:48,700 --> 04:28:57,600
same oh cry you see your position i'm doing the same things
you said it would be all so many times because now crook

4402
04:28:57,600 --> 04:29:03,540
looking behind he can't deal damage in main not dealing
damage in main means me and snake is can't walk deep

4403
04:29:03,540 --> 04:29:09,860
regardless of if what we do even though he has all the
resources.

4404
04:29:10,560 --> 04:29:16,080
Remember, on tank, it's important for warning to take damage
during situations like this so we can get something out of

4405
04:29:16,080 --> 04:29:16,540
play in support.

4406
04:29:17,060 --> 04:29:18,980
We need to occupy our supports too.

4407
04:29:19,300 --> 04:29:20,520
We don't want them to AFK.

4408
04:29:20,900 --> 04:29:23,580
If we AFK on the map, our supports also AFK.

4409
04:29:24,100 --> 04:29:25,800
At least to some extent.

4410
04:29:26,480 --> 04:29:34,140
So we need our Invis, if we have Invis rocket pierce here,
we can walk all the way over here if we want.

4411
04:29:34,340 --> 04:29:41,020
There's no prevent to walk here if we have this lineup And
if we have this lineup here, we take all the resources

4412
04:29:41,020 --> 04:29:42,980
because we occupy the support position.

4413
04:29:43,400 --> 04:29:45,340
So the support has to re-rotate if they don't.

4414
04:29:45,720 --> 04:29:52,080
All the people playing outside of the support LOS will
eventually lose resources, lose HP and lose eventually cause

4415
04:29:52,080 --> 04:29:57,300
dying or cause to Indusworlds or cause any kind of like
reaction from there.

4416
04:29:57,740 --> 04:30:03,460
If we're not able to do that, regardless of what comp we're
playing, we're going to struggle against against good teams,

4417
04:30:04,060 --> 04:30:04,200
right?

4418
04:30:04,360 --> 04:30:05,540
We're talking about the good teams.

4419
04:30:05,800 --> 04:30:07,640
This team, obviously not the best.

4420
04:30:07,660 --> 04:30:15,520
same thing i would also say crooks ults here is pretty bad
it needs to be inside of the enemy backlight it's not on it

4421
04:30:15,520 --> 04:30:22,940
can't be on point it needs to be inside of the backlight he
could is able to develop crooks area why it is here i can't

4422
04:30:22,940 --> 04:30:31,100
know for sure i would have to watch a pov on why he would do
that but obviously eventually i think he wanted to put it

4423
04:30:31,100 --> 04:30:37,980
deeper i think he like went back automatically and then the
same thing happens that comes away energy is good because he

4424
04:30:37,980 --> 04:30:40,200
punishes you for playing a bad position.

4425
04:30:40,520 --> 04:30:45,820
So once again, I have two DPS that force resources away from
the pressure where we want to go.

4426
04:30:46,020 --> 04:30:47,000
And Snake has, you're not walking.

4427
04:30:47,860 --> 04:30:50,140
So all of this leads into never killing background.

4428
04:30:51,180 --> 04:30:51,780
You know what I mean?

4429
04:30:52,160 --> 04:30:53,880
This is what I mean with development on the map.

4430
04:30:53,980 --> 04:30:58,000
You guys take development in a way that it just forces too
many resources away.

4431
04:30:58,000 --> 04:30:58,700
Can you rewind?

4432
04:30:58,900 --> 04:31:00,060
I think I got res beacons.

4433
04:31:00,200 --> 04:31:03,700
I want to see if I instantly walked or if that's just the
timing from when I came back.

4434
04:31:10,920 --> 04:31:20,800
should take high ground here i think and just shoot the tank
some points i think or could walk instantly to the team to

4435
04:31:20,800 --> 04:31:28,280
stack with the heals good mechord though okay kind of said
we couldn't follow up on it and now we have the same

4436
04:31:28,280 --> 04:31:36,140
situation okay same situation i think crocus no crocus is
definite right now i don't even know he's streaming oh you

4437
04:31:36,140 --> 04:31:45,000
don't have blood actually now we need to do the same thing
you need to walk he went offline he was out he's out all the

4438
04:31:45,000 --> 04:31:53,680
pressure on point you need to walk there's no reason he's
like i'm done i'm like too scared like they had no damage i

4439
04:31:53,680 --> 04:32:00,200
mean everyone is not playing the game as hard as it sounds
we need to cut the supply these guys are not bad you know

4440
04:32:00,200 --> 04:32:10,000
now once their supply is cut we can actually end up killing
them you know and now you take the flank without bubble so

4441
04:32:10,000 --> 04:32:18,760
you end up dying for it very sad i mean energy punished you
very well this guy was doing so much on strange he just he

4442
04:32:18,760 --> 04:32:25,680
knows exactly when you're out of position so he punishes you
which is also the same thing when he's on phoenix he knows

4443
04:32:25,680 --> 04:32:30,620
how to play around his resources so he wins most of the
resource trades and it's the same thing with terra

4444
04:32:30,620 --> 04:32:37,500
unfortunately but that's what makes the difference right in
the end of the just normal right i'm not uh i don't want to

4445
04:32:37,500 --> 04:32:44,440
like um say anything other than that it's it's obviously
normal right this is why this is why they are pros right

4446
04:32:44,440 --> 04:32:51,200
this is why they play every single minute of their life
trying to remix everything everything around them right so

4447
04:32:51,200 --> 04:32:58,020
this was just the main thing that i noticed right here in
this position right uh crook said dokey bird you should

4448
04:32:58,020 --> 04:33:04,960
cloak fate um it's it's kind of like the fact that we burnt
all roots earlier so now we have no other wind conditions

4449
04:33:04,960 --> 04:33:11,740
but you lie on you don't you good but obviously this this is
very hard and it can't be it can't be on you like the

4450
04:33:11,740 --> 04:33:18,240
biggest problem here is the way how we play earlier right
the one big problem in an example is we see there's pressure

4451
04:33:18,240 --> 04:33:26,380
on our back line and we have resources i'm listening i'm
listening with cloak so you should stack at this edge of the

4452
04:33:26,380 --> 04:33:33,740
point here i'm listening but we're not doing that so you end
up causing more real issues because look at our healing

4453
04:33:33,740 --> 04:33:41,760
resources we don't have burst healing on brood so by you
isolating yourself duck and taking so much damage you just

4454
04:33:41,760 --> 04:33:48,380
force us to walk back out in a situation where we might not
necessarily want to walk right i would want you to stack

4455
04:33:48,380 --> 04:33:54,580
with us so you can get advantage out of my e because you get
damage reduction so you can farm the goky bird ult because

4456
04:33:54,580 --> 04:34:01,920
goky is a very big win condition in this game for us at
least in this matchup but you end up like playing too far

4457
04:34:01,920 --> 04:34:10,280
away from us away from your can't like do it you know we
obviously need to prevent them from committing deeper so

4458
04:34:10,280 --> 04:34:15,960
this is like one of the things and this is like one small it
all has to do with playing around the resources that we have

4459
04:34:15,960 --> 04:34:22,280
right we need to think about what kind of like resources do
we have do we have long range healing how good is the long

4460
04:34:22,280 --> 04:34:31,540
range healing we have a good aoe or more burst burst healing
and that's like a large contributor what happened on the

4461
04:34:31,540 --> 04:34:40,680
hell 7 map is is kind of insane all right there was kind of
like a lot of fights that were so many situations where we

4462
04:34:40,680 --> 04:34:50,400
can create a win condition by just being in pressure
position but not taking them the amount is like infinite a

4463
04:34:50,400 --> 04:34:57,420
good situation is this one right i want to play up i want to
farm my my book right obviously I need to farm my book.

4464
04:34:58,380 --> 04:35:02,460
A big problem for me is the fact that we just give up space
now.

4465
04:35:03,500 --> 04:35:05,640
One big problem is I say we want to play slow.

4466
04:35:05,780 --> 04:35:06,540
I have touch forever.

4467
04:35:06,940 --> 04:35:10,420
That doesn't mean that we need to sacrifice giving up space.

4468
04:35:11,160 --> 04:35:13,360
I would want our Starload to shoot the Angela here.

4469
04:35:13,420 --> 04:35:14,660
We need to shoot the development.

4470
04:35:15,100 --> 04:35:20,560
The enemy Angela was out of position infinite amount of
times and we need to punish him for doing that.

4471
04:35:20,940 --> 04:35:28,980
Like right here in example you poke here for almost zero
damage against AoE healers without any hits so if snake hit

4472
04:35:28,980 --> 04:35:35,760
slams in they know exactly the bucky knows exactly where he
needs to shift to one shot you because he knows where you're

4473
04:35:35,760 --> 04:35:41,080
coming from so you gave up your position for 10 damage
instead of shooting the angela from main and then developing

4474
04:35:41,080 --> 04:35:48,080
later these are like all small things that add into them
being able to i'll still be listening guys i'll still be

4475
04:35:48,080 --> 04:35:54,420
listening i swear regardless of what happens now you have to
give up which is okay but we need to play a bit slower i

4476
04:35:54,420 --> 04:35:58,940
need i need i need some more There's no reason to fly that
much here.

4477
04:35:58,960 --> 04:35:59,440
I need stimulation.

4478
04:35:59,760 --> 04:36:03,160
If you just have a safe position where no one can beat you
and shoot you, it's okay.

4479
04:36:03,720 --> 04:36:04,320
We hit right now.

4480
04:36:04,360 --> 04:36:04,780
I go back.

4481
04:36:04,920 --> 04:36:05,420
I go back.

4482
04:36:05,600 --> 04:36:06,560
It's kind of too early.

4483
04:36:06,640 --> 04:36:07,640
I need stimulation.

4484
04:36:07,800 --> 04:36:10,380
You know, because once more I say I have touch.

4485
04:36:10,440 --> 04:36:12,060
I came to an empty.

4486
04:36:12,860 --> 04:36:14,040
I have touch forever.

4487
04:36:14,240 --> 04:36:19,400
That means that the enemy mag would have to walk in this
area for me to punish it.

4488
04:36:19,740 --> 04:36:20,760
And the same thing would apply.

4489
04:36:21,080 --> 04:36:26,280
If he walks in this area and you slam backline, I have the
decision to either one shot the mag or shoot the mag.

4490
04:36:26,420 --> 04:36:32,140
or have the decision to shoot the backline and help you
right and the same goes for everyone in the team my phoenix

4491
04:36:32,140 --> 04:36:37,400
has the decision to shoot the mag or to stand or to stun the
backline you should always send the backline or to develop

4492
04:36:37,400 --> 04:36:42,540
on the backline and the same for the starlord you can shoot
the mag or shoot the backline one of these things has to

4493
04:36:42,540 --> 04:36:48,780
happen but now it's a very early commit and the rubber band
out of that commit is always the same thing now that the

4494
04:36:48,780 --> 04:36:57,080
commit is now that the hit is gone right and this is why you
have to instantly disengage when you say like there's no

4495
04:36:57,080 --> 04:37:03,220
reason for me to do that no i die it's not only that you die
but the problem now is the rubber band is they get to take

4496
04:37:03,220 --> 04:37:08,920
space i hope he doesn't talk about me so they don't need to
fear that you slam when they walk so that gives them time to

4497
04:37:08,920 --> 04:37:14,500
take notes for me if he mentions me guys you know the enemy
doesn't have wolf crap so now you walk and now it's the same

4498
04:37:14,500 --> 04:37:20,080
case you know now they can just walk unpunished so we need
to reposition or we need to put equal amount of pressure

4499
04:37:20,080 --> 04:37:28,700
equal amount of pressure can arise by going in the back line
right now with can do the same kind of pressure, you know,

4500
04:37:28,880 --> 04:37:29,760
by preventing us to walk.

4501
04:37:29,920 --> 04:37:31,060
It's what Terra did, right?

4502
04:37:31,140 --> 04:37:31,980
Terra flanked a lot.

4503
04:37:32,160 --> 04:37:34,940
He offends a lot at the right time, at the right moment.

4504
04:37:35,380 --> 04:37:41,280
So he caused a lot of people to look at him, and then he's
smart enough to live or to decide to go deeper, right?

4505
04:37:41,520 --> 04:37:42,840
And that just makes the better player.

4506
04:37:43,220 --> 04:37:48,280
So now we eventually get pushed very deep, and we don't have
our hits, and all our resources are displayed far.

4507
04:37:48,500 --> 04:37:50,640
What they do right now is very smart.

4508
04:37:50,760 --> 04:37:52,040
This is a very good combo, right?

4509
04:37:52,040 --> 04:37:58,620
Because it punishes the positional or like the issue that we
have by not getting hit by putting even more pressure along

4510
04:37:58,620 --> 04:38:04,480
the point by sustaining the fact that we can't hit now
because if we had another opportunity to hit maybe they

4511
04:38:04,480 --> 04:38:09,140
would have to invisible like this which gives me the
opportunity to touch at the edge so they can really clear me

4512
04:38:09,140 --> 04:38:16,280
while i get healed and they mention me unfortunately we're
not able to do that once more dokey bird you could probably

4513
04:38:16,280 --> 04:38:22,680
line up with me here to get healing or you probably had to
re-rotate with crook into me yeah two things had to happen

4514
04:38:22,680 --> 04:38:29,440
just because we need to make sure that this development is
going to be a problem to us because they're going to cut the

4515
04:38:29,440 --> 04:38:36,100
supply to you guys to me right so that is very very
unfortunate and i just get one shot i can't even react so

4516
04:38:36,100 --> 04:38:43,100
it's like very unlucky but yeah i mean everyone plays about
that we could have also what we could have also done in the

4517
04:38:43,100 --> 04:38:48,000
in hindsight's right what i could have done better is i
should have said snake as you touch around the point and you

4518
04:38:48,000 --> 04:38:52,780
walk around the pillar because you're better at touching
than i am and we made out the invisible and after the

4519
04:38:52,780 --> 04:38:59,300
invisible is gone you e and hit backline with me and came
back just in time to say yeah right there's for sure

4520
04:38:59,300 --> 04:39:05,660
situations here where we where either of us could have i
came back just to be like yeah right and it's the same for

4521
04:39:05,660 --> 04:39:09,960
my dps right i mean my starlight was afk on the other side
of the map allowing them to take that's okay i'm getting

4522
04:39:09,960 --> 04:39:15,220
myself right when you should have shot the right person at
the right time which was the enemy loki right when you got

4523
04:39:15,220 --> 04:39:22,120
done yeah what enemy in this match one of the two things
like if you go from behind right now which you had a good

4524
04:39:22,120 --> 04:39:28,320
position to do and shoot the enemy loki earlier instead of
letting him walk this entire space into the Invisold, then

4525
04:39:28,320 --> 04:39:36,220
you would at least force land, which afterwards would create
a chance for our venom to hit without the risk of it being

4526
04:39:36,220 --> 04:39:36,900
lambed.

4527
04:39:37,420 --> 04:39:38,640
That was so cool.

4528
04:39:38,780 --> 04:39:40,900
When you said, yeah, it's okay.

4529
04:39:41,240 --> 04:39:41,380
Thank you.

4530
04:39:41,560 --> 04:39:44,720
The next fight is kind of sad because we end up getting
entry picked early.

4531
04:39:45,260 --> 04:39:45,860
They'll never know.

4532
04:39:45,940 --> 04:39:46,960
Truth said, we want to wait.

4533
04:39:47,380 --> 04:39:50,080
Very important is here we need someone to touch the point.

4534
04:39:50,720 --> 04:39:58,420
Even we make a decision to have someone get flaked because
it's very hard to be protested but in this situation it's

4535
04:39:58,420 --> 04:40:05,600
not favorable so it's okay if we all we're getting vaude
reveal but we need to do it a bit this is what vaude this is

4536
04:40:05,600 --> 04:40:12,380
what pro play is like i had vaude i used to do vaude reviews
too and overwatch and scrims and coaching it was very

4537
04:40:12,380 --> 04:40:19,560
exhausting and then i didn't even get paid i mean the team
paid for my coaching sessions but like it was so exhausting

4538
04:40:19,560 --> 04:40:28,780
we should be able to just literally like six hours of scrims
this coaching session the body reveal it's it's so

4539
04:40:28,780 --> 04:40:38,220
exhausting it's like four four to six hours of scrims but
it's in overwatch like every day it's high every other day

4540
04:40:38,220 --> 04:40:45,200
it's okay we go next fight here we could have maybe turned
the fight it's like not fun point is very important and it's

4541
04:40:45,200 --> 04:40:51,530
very good and like what you would do with kev always it just
i was like barely paid for it i mean they

4542
04:40:54,860 --> 04:41:01,080
has to come back to the point which gives you yeah because
like each scrims are like two hours each scrims are two

4543
04:41:01,080 --> 04:41:09,060
hours um like for each session and then they would like do
triple booking scrims sometimes it would be like four four

4544
04:41:09,060 --> 04:41:14,780
hours would be like two teams six hours would be three teams
right because look at what they did the entire very

4545
04:41:14,780 --> 04:41:21,360
exhausting the entire formation collapsed that was just then
like i fell for again i was like well we'll try doing that

4546
04:41:21,360 --> 04:41:29,040
again we'll try rune so it'll create true moons...how that
goes...

4547
04:41:29,040 --> 04:41:30,900
And it's definitely very exhausting.

4548
04:41:31,100 --> 04:41:32,420
I forgot how exhausting it is.

4549
04:41:32,600 --> 04:41:33,460
But I'm learning a lot.

4550
04:41:33,480 --> 04:41:34,760
I am learning a lot though.

4551
04:41:34,900 --> 04:41:36,440
I'm getting better as a player, I will say.

4552
04:41:36,920 --> 04:41:38,860
Eventually what will happen is their back line will go over
the way back.

4553
04:41:38,860 --> 04:41:41,400
I think I'm getting better as a player though, doing this.

4554
04:41:42,160 --> 04:41:43,640
So I appreciate learning.

4555
04:41:44,820 --> 04:41:47,020
But it definitely is very, very tight.

4556
04:41:48,400 --> 04:41:53,660
I mean, I just aggroed like that cause... I aggroed like
that because we could have killed Angula.

4557
04:41:54,900 --> 04:42:02,560
yeah but who's supposed to kill the angela he has triple
pocket by supports and in the shield loki land yes uh all

4558
04:42:02,560 --> 04:42:09,260
that you rely on right now is the fact that snake has hits
all headshots on this guy this guy has shield and who else

4559
04:42:09,260 --> 04:42:15,820
is shooting him yeah it was before they peeled but we almost
did kill him because i would have repositioned sooner but

4560
04:42:15,820 --> 04:42:22,040
can you stop by i thought we could have killed him yeah the
idea of going for this guy is just wrong in general in this

4561
04:42:22,040 --> 04:42:27,960
room it's not about the fact that you can kill him you can
always kill people who are misplaying right the fact that we

4562
04:42:27,960 --> 04:42:35,480
i think it's up to them whether this guy dies or not right
of course their backline can just pull afk rain afk go this

4563
04:42:35,480 --> 04:42:42,080
way and you guys will kill this guy of course that's the
idea but the general fight should be that you are able to

4564
04:42:42,080 --> 04:42:49,660
develop on the back i am actually and now you're so scared
just because you did 50 damage to the end so the rather than

4565
04:42:49,660 --> 04:42:56,460
the fact of wanting to kill the end i was so scared of the
penny mines and here the That's a big problem to our dive.

4566
04:42:59,600 --> 04:43:01,980
Now we want to commit top on and you see what it does.

4567
04:43:02,300 --> 04:43:05,340
This is great for us, right?

4568
04:43:08,380 --> 04:43:11,340
Oh my god, I forgot that other people...

4569
04:43:11,340 --> 04:43:12,820
It kind of needed us to walk a bit sooner.

4570
04:43:13,040 --> 04:43:13,340
I get hit.

4571
04:43:14,780 --> 04:43:15,600
Why did I get hit?

4572
04:43:16,380 --> 04:43:17,480
Oh, I got underlined.

4573
04:43:18,660 --> 04:43:22,400
I get why we didn't walk early.

4574
04:43:22,620 --> 04:43:23,620
We probably should have waited a bit.

4575
04:43:23,620 --> 04:43:23,780
Nice pickup.

4576
04:43:24,860 --> 04:43:33,420
keep committing I keep thinking we should probably call
because it's like once again the same position right?

4577
04:43:34,020 --> 04:43:42,640
We wait two seconds it doesn't harm us you know and I kind
of commit because it's like Phoenix right, Phoenix right we

4578
04:43:42,640 --> 04:43:48,440
should just like wait one or two seconds because obviously
we need to remember what our team has and what they don't

4579
04:43:48,440 --> 04:43:54,760
right now very important is to keep working backwards we
need to make sure that we wipe if we don't wipe right now

4580
04:43:54,860 --> 04:43:57,120
There's no reason on...

4581
04:43:57,120 --> 04:43:58,080
Bro, who is...

4582
04:43:58,080 --> 04:43:58,760
The voices!

4583
04:43:59,300 --> 04:44:00,100
There's generally no reason.

4584
04:44:00,240 --> 04:44:01,660
We need to just walk past them.

4585
04:44:01,900 --> 04:44:02,940
On the backline, everyone.

4586
04:44:03,360 --> 04:44:03,880
And try to wipe.

4587
04:44:04,140 --> 04:44:05,040
Now this is good.

4588
04:44:05,180 --> 04:44:06,640
They've lost Inezol away from the point.

4589
04:44:06,960 --> 04:44:09,120
So now we can focus on living because we're not killing Fru.

4590
04:44:09,600 --> 04:44:10,900
It's okay if we can't kill Fru.

4591
04:44:11,140 --> 04:44:12,240
Wait, how is he off of that?

4592
04:44:12,900 --> 04:44:13,820
Oh wait, that's 7 meter?

4593
04:44:13,820 --> 04:44:15,900
And I think this was a good fight overall.

4594
04:44:16,280 --> 04:44:17,200
Because it puts pressure on them.

4595
04:44:17,200 --> 04:44:17,860
Oh, wait, it is.

4596
04:44:18,180 --> 04:44:21,340
I still think the matchup is really good.

4597
04:44:21,840 --> 04:44:23,340
The next fight...

4598
04:44:23,340 --> 04:44:24,080
Hey, man.

4599
04:44:24,860 --> 04:44:25,720
Wait, he actually leaps.

4600
04:44:27,180 --> 04:44:28,120
Okay, I can actually listen.

4601
04:44:28,740 --> 04:44:30,920
I'm like hearing...

4602
04:44:30,920 --> 04:44:32,700
Oh, he's the Adam Res and then they retouch, I think.

4603
04:44:35,880 --> 04:44:38,680
Ah, he's so fucking...

4604
04:44:39,180 --> 04:44:40,100
I mean, it's fine.

4605
04:44:40,500 --> 04:44:41,940
You know, the next fight is okay.

4606
04:44:42,700 --> 04:44:48,840
Good part about this though, is by not playing wall, and
this is like a common thing, we at least have three fights.

4607
04:44:49,140 --> 04:44:51,700
Oh my god, I'm so fucking alive.

4608
04:44:54,860 --> 04:45:03,560
like 99 okay it's not and the enemy has 99 because it's only
one fight basically i'm so alive because it's a back and

4609
04:45:03,560 --> 04:45:11,460
forth or resource thing one damage or anything so it's
normal to have these own fights this invisible is maybe a

4610
04:45:11,460 --> 04:45:18,780
bit forced and maybe a bit too early because it doesn't
really get us much oh yeah i just remember like yeah i know

4611
04:45:18,780 --> 04:45:26,700
there was a call for me to invis or to engage so then i just
checked it yeah i see that but what i meant is in the sense

4612
04:45:26,700 --> 04:45:31,460
of you heard the bucket sound and you're not putting
pressure on the people on the point similar to how we want

4613
04:45:31,460 --> 04:45:37,660
to develop on their background here we need the individual
to do somewhat in this area so we're able to yeah clear the

4614
04:45:37,660 --> 04:45:46,140
point side right and and force a 1v5 against the back or be
able to develop into an area where you can create a few more

4615
04:45:46,140 --> 04:45:47,100
later these areas

4616
04:45:51,960 --> 04:45:56,720
yeah it happens right it's not like so Very important here
though.

4617
04:45:56,720 --> 04:45:57,060
Nice.

4618
04:45:57,580 --> 04:45:58,400
You need to shoot Angela.

4619
04:45:58,840 --> 04:46:01,640
This is like a situation, especially against her.

4620
04:46:01,640 --> 04:46:03,300
I'm gonna say like a weak shot.

4621
04:46:03,760 --> 04:46:05,400
Back shot, back shot, back shot, back shot, back shot.

4622
04:46:05,720 --> 04:46:06,780
Mistakes are punishable.

4623
04:46:07,240 --> 04:46:08,340
You need to call out mistakes.

4624
04:46:08,780 --> 04:46:10,140
But Angela is very deep.

4625
04:46:10,360 --> 04:46:12,280
He has very bad movement during the episode.

4626
04:46:12,880 --> 04:46:14,680
Everyone needs to shoot her.

4627
04:46:14,700 --> 04:46:18,660
I have two DPS that are not shooting.

4628
04:46:19,160 --> 04:46:19,980
This is unacceptable.

4629
04:46:20,860 --> 04:46:23,040
Especially if we play these tournaments.

4630
04:46:24,860 --> 04:46:34,460
if we want to have coordination there's part of calling
stuff out and too many voices too many and he wanted to this

4631
04:46:34,460 --> 04:46:40,220
was a situation where i think she needed to die duck right
but none of us shot him and once more we're in the position

4632
04:46:40,220 --> 04:46:47,080
where both of my dps have a high ground offside of the
resources that we want to play right regardless of how the

4633
04:46:47,080 --> 04:46:52,940
resource is distributed because this individual could also
improve right we could also maybe have went top and set that

4634
04:46:52,940 --> 04:46:58,420
would have maybe made it better because then we can force
down the high ground and maybe we we needed a dps to play

4635
04:46:58,420 --> 04:47:04,020
main with us and one day to flank right the guy with flake
should flank which should be the phoenix because you're very

4636
04:47:04,020 --> 04:47:11,180
hard to be contested and we can join you on the flank with
venom and with um yo it's vaude review i'm listening to the

4637
04:47:11,180 --> 04:47:19,580
review right now but i this is my jingle jingo so i can
focus on the vaude review because i was like i can't focus

4638
04:47:19,580 --> 04:47:33,640
i've got to play i've got video game get out of my head get
out of my because he wants to slap he needs to start the

4639
04:47:33,640 --> 04:47:42,860
back line right there's the there's our igl it's literally
our our take whatsoever i'm listening to the coaching right

4640
04:47:42,860 --> 04:47:49,420
now but i mean because you're so late to the fight you did
like 10 damage to the diet so you're better off clearing i'm

4641
04:47:49,420 --> 04:47:56,480
listening to the my coach giving us our igl slash coach
teaching us the game we have

4642
04:48:00,360 --> 04:48:10,580
so now you should shoot the angel on the flank when you're
trying to flank whereas if you were connected to the guys

4643
04:48:10,580 --> 04:48:22,440
earlier then you could spin him and we would actually have a
chance to pick so these are like old things like they're

4644
04:48:22,440 --> 04:48:28,160
literally those things in a 99-99 game where they can all
make a big difference.

4645
04:48:28,160 --> 04:48:29,260
We all need this.

4646
04:48:29,640 --> 04:48:37,440
Every single player, every single decision makes such a
large difference to the entire structure of the entire game.

4647
04:48:39,040 --> 04:48:41,300
Although, you know, here I also die.

4648
04:48:41,600 --> 04:48:42,820
It's very sad that I died.

4649
04:48:43,700 --> 04:48:45,960
I was marked and I hope for healing.

4650
04:48:46,480 --> 04:48:48,420
But the angela was more than he needed to develop.

4651
04:48:49,320 --> 04:48:52,880
And solely, once more, because we had no development on
Phoenix.

4652
04:48:53,140 --> 04:48:57,560
If we have developed them on Phoenix here, then Angela has
to make a decision to shoot you out or to shoot my backpack,

4653
04:48:58,040 --> 04:48:59,000
which is great for us.

4654
04:48:59,360 --> 04:49:05,140
Because we still have the interest here, so we should use
that advantage to be developed for an agent like this.

4655
04:49:06,480 --> 04:49:08,140
And of course, it's normal, right?

4656
04:49:08,900 --> 04:49:09,620
Next fight.

4657
04:49:11,140 --> 04:49:12,780
This fight was great for us.

4658
04:49:13,480 --> 04:49:14,880
Oh my God, he's never gonna miss.

4659
04:49:14,900 --> 04:49:15,640
Because we had a difference.

4660
04:49:16,560 --> 04:49:17,460
Oh my God, no.

4661
04:49:17,980 --> 04:49:18,680
It'd be out of here.

4662
04:49:19,420 --> 04:49:19,940
It'd be out of here.

4663
04:49:20,380 --> 04:49:21,500
We have resources.

4664
04:49:21,940 --> 04:49:22,200
We have.

4665
04:49:23,960 --> 04:49:26,400
Where did my team go?

4666
04:49:26,760 --> 04:49:27,220
Where did my team go?

4667
04:49:27,340 --> 04:49:29,380
Because infinite range...

4668
04:49:29,380 --> 04:49:31,100
Where did he go?

4669
04:49:32,000 --> 04:49:32,540
We need a TP.

4670
04:49:32,700 --> 04:49:35,060
Raccoon, Luna, Shark, Jeff.

4671
04:49:35,980 --> 04:49:38,080
Those three characters have really good healing on range.

4672
04:49:38,280 --> 04:49:39,580
No other support character has.

4673
04:49:41,260 --> 04:49:42,960
Touch because we're just dying.

4674
04:49:44,600 --> 04:49:45,540
Point's still the same.

4675
04:49:45,860 --> 04:49:50,680
The idea with infinite range healing is that we create kill
boxes far away from the people that play the fight.

4676
04:49:51,200 --> 04:49:59,780
So let's say like, I'll have Bucky, can play the fight from
here with me where oh i should just die oh yeah i got it

4677
04:49:59,780 --> 04:50:06,020
it's very hard to contest for phoenix because our lunar can
help you to rewind this area same with our venom same all

4678
04:50:06,020 --> 04:50:12,120
right we need a phoenix mag lunar damage boost so phoenix
going high ground would have been really good there's no

4679
04:50:12,120 --> 04:50:17,760
drawback on phoenix going high ground because it plays with
the enemy's fear of dropping in the back line and sad back

4680
04:50:17,760 --> 04:50:23,360
line can't contest it they have no movement heroes that
can't contest you so by giving flake to phoenix they you

4681
04:50:23,360 --> 04:50:30,800
off-angling in their back it's a constant threat where our
venom gets to slam their hitbox their killbox where you can

4682
04:50:30,800 --> 04:50:42,600
stun the i think he's getting different guys i could have
started i think he's getting different guys it's just the

4683
04:50:42,600 --> 04:50:50,400
worst of the game this is the same thing we end up killing
here we end up winning the fight it's okay and now it's the

4684
04:50:50,400 --> 04:50:54,520
same situation We need to create pressure around this area.

4685
04:50:54,520 --> 04:50:56,700
There's no other way of doing it.

4686
04:50:56,900 --> 04:51:02,040
My position alone hinders that from walking up, that cost
them 10%.

4687
04:51:02,040 --> 04:51:05,300
This is a positional advantage that we need to outplay.

4688
04:51:05,400 --> 04:51:06,760
And it's the same thing with these.

4689
04:51:07,060 --> 04:51:08,060
They have even more.

4690
04:51:08,260 --> 04:51:08,520
Oh my god.

4691
04:51:08,720 --> 04:51:09,800
They don't have another encounter.

4692
04:51:09,820 --> 04:51:10,720
Surely he's not.

4693
04:51:10,980 --> 04:51:15,760
So flanking right now and going in the middle of the same
way as the most optimal way.

4694
04:51:17,240 --> 04:51:18,840
I don't have to die.

4695
04:51:21,160 --> 04:51:26,760
support is so strong and ranked because everyone just
mindlessly shoots down main because it's when everyone

4696
04:51:26,760 --> 04:51:38,440
focused on main all you do is you feed supporters and those
supporters can be invested to play out their brawl advantage

4697
04:51:38,440 --> 04:51:46,420
into a right because they have a brawl advantage so they
don't want to let them play it out now all the damage is

4698
04:51:46,420 --> 04:51:50,360
stacking in from the same angle so that tank can absorb the
damage from the same angle.

4699
04:51:50,540 --> 04:51:52,220
So they can make more leaders on the point.

4700
04:51:52,640 --> 04:51:56,400
Therefore, making our hit weaker because all the hit will
contain is being stealthed.

4701
04:51:56,540 --> 04:51:56,920
No.

4702
04:51:57,540 --> 04:51:58,840
Yo, why are we on close misses?

4703
04:51:59,240 --> 04:51:59,900
Go back to what we have.

4704
04:52:02,620 --> 04:52:09,940
Where we have the resources to angle because before you can
argue we had resources to angle in a different sense.

4705
04:52:10,380 --> 04:52:14,620
Like you shouldn't off-angle in this way, but you should
off-angle in this way when you stick in the raccoon unit,

4706
04:52:15,060 --> 04:52:15,220
right?

4707
04:52:15,300 --> 04:52:15,740
In the long range.

4708
04:52:15,740 --> 04:52:17,500
He hasn't mentioned anything about me.

4709
04:52:17,620 --> 04:52:24,180
now you you can actually off angle because you have fake
value and you can go behind right but without being punished

4710
04:52:24,180 --> 04:52:29,260
because they don't have cooldowns to punish the only one
that can punish you is the bucky by shifting up but you

4711
04:52:29,260 --> 04:52:37,320
should better be able to do it if I'm here too and then we
can play slow forever now you wanted us to follow up on the

4712
04:52:37,320 --> 04:52:44,400
group we did that snake case stamps backline I go for the
backline but he just landed so this is what I meant Doug

4713
04:52:44,400 --> 04:52:50,140
when I said it's very hard to follow up on on any group
because they just have good we need to reset for last night

4714
04:52:50,140 --> 04:52:51,620
we need to reset but what is guys for sure

4715
04:52:55,520 --> 04:53:08,620
i think that's another thing like you're saying last map
just like target targeting and you gotta be targeting people

4716
04:53:08,620 --> 04:53:17,240
you call it like that like that angela you said that that
venom on yig's guard and yeah i think some hooks here and

4717
04:53:17,240 --> 04:53:22,080
this is the situation i mean algo and there's really like
this is like obviously since you're learning if you want to

4718
04:53:22,080 --> 04:53:28,840
get better this is the position where you're just like
there's too many people in my team that are not supporting

4719
04:53:28,840 --> 04:53:35,180
this area if you're behind them right now with flaking
example because troop doesn't see the value in flaking you

4720
04:53:35,180 --> 04:53:40,700
so he flakes himself for the damage boosted you know the
damage boost him but like he wants to do damage right he

4721
04:53:40,700 --> 04:53:49,860
needs to follow our our hawk eyes get it because now you
phoenix also from main instead of from behind i can play

4722
04:53:49,860 --> 04:53:55,340
that character i can try to dip them so ultimate goal would
be once more to set up a pinch right where we have front

4723
04:53:55,340 --> 04:54:01,980
line pressure and the opportunity from backline pressure to
make the enemy supports forces decision same with the enemy

4724
04:54:01,980 --> 04:54:07,880
tanks amazing to go for right like we had the situation with
the enemy phoenix when terror was taking the high ground

4725
04:54:07,880 --> 04:54:13,040
guys who clears terror who clears terror two minutes it took
yeah yeah they're doing He's doing a VOD review.

4726
04:54:13,380 --> 04:54:16,040
And then, yeah, because he's coaching us.

4727
04:54:16,360 --> 04:54:19,360
Obviously, you can have counterplay, but in tournaments like
this, it's very strong.

4728
04:54:20,020 --> 04:54:20,620
Now we need to wait.

4729
04:54:21,160 --> 04:54:22,520
Here's Nake's, same thing.

4730
04:54:22,900 --> 04:54:23,620
You stay in too long.

4731
04:54:23,720 --> 04:54:24,340
The hit is gone.

4732
04:54:24,800 --> 04:54:25,980
I need to instantly go out.

4733
04:54:26,800 --> 04:54:28,620
There's nothing we can gain out of this.

4734
04:54:29,060 --> 04:54:29,760
So just need to go out.

4735
04:54:30,100 --> 04:54:31,180
We need to set up a new hit.

4736
04:54:31,380 --> 04:54:32,440
Wait the ult out.

4737
04:54:32,900 --> 04:54:36,640
And then, once the ult is out, what we can do is look at the
ult economy.

4738
04:54:37,420 --> 04:54:38,660
They have two good ults out.

4739
04:54:38,660 --> 04:54:39,460
I need to be marked more.

4740
04:54:39,560 --> 04:54:41,000
Invisal deep, win the fight.

4741
04:54:41,200 --> 04:54:49,520
strange i mean if we prepare for that right now yeah i'm
gonna go grab ash too no enemies no nothing and we tracked

4742
04:54:49,520 --> 04:54:56,760
that we knew what else they had since we always asked yeah
so these are all things that can lead into it so here's same

4743
04:54:56,760 --> 04:55:05,400
thing if we play slow now invisible deep but our indesult is
outside of us not creating pressure on the back line so the

4744
04:55:05,400 --> 04:55:11,980
problem with indesults like this is yeah it just gives us no
opportunities to play out our advantage Right, because we

4745
04:55:11,980 --> 04:55:15,240
need to, during the Inversal, we have a Brawl advantage.

4746
04:55:15,320 --> 04:55:15,780
What the?

4747
04:55:15,900 --> 04:55:18,380
How did our mag fucking fell down?

4748
04:55:18,540 --> 04:55:20,780
Because Delcom is better than Brawl.

4749
04:55:21,200 --> 04:55:21,980
They win the resource trades.

4750
04:55:21,980 --> 04:55:23,420
I know he like fell down, bro.

4751
04:55:24,180 --> 04:55:25,380
Against us shooting Frontline.

4752
04:55:25,860 --> 04:55:27,020
We win the resource trades.

4753
04:55:27,320 --> 04:55:32,540
Someone in the backline is contested, so we can overwhelm
the guy in front that gets usually...

4754
04:55:32,540 --> 04:55:32,660
What?

4755
04:55:33,100 --> 04:55:34,100
You need a backup second party.

4756
04:55:34,800 --> 04:55:35,720
Where was that?

4757
04:55:36,340 --> 04:55:37,120
Now we don't have that.

4758
04:55:37,120 --> 04:55:37,780
Where was that?

4759
04:55:37,880 --> 04:55:38,440
Because the Inversal is far away.

4760
04:55:38,460 --> 04:55:39,620
I was full HP!

4761
04:55:41,200 --> 04:55:47,220
it's okay we play out the fight we had a situation where
maybe we can kill energy here you know we hooked them need

4762
04:55:47,220 --> 04:55:54,120
to have proper target focused it's quite safe he doesn't die
you know you can argue yeah mechanics play a difference here

4763
04:55:54,120 --> 04:56:03,860
100 it's okay the root issue of the fight is still the the
entire plan that we had around the way we played the fact

4764
04:56:03,860 --> 04:56:14,580
that we didn't have peace no you took zero damage this fight
which is just not the uh which is the win condition with

4765
04:56:14,580 --> 04:56:28,320
roscoe right so it happens next fight that's great i got you
i got you just got uh i think you got hope you know i'm not

4766
04:56:28,320 --> 04:56:34,260
sure i don't know oh i just like i was dumb i should have
went around you should have went i didn't like all right

4767
04:56:34,260 --> 04:56:41,920
yeah i don't know i feel like it's like the my honest
opinion on this is always the same it should be like visual

4768
04:56:41,920 --> 04:56:50,600
right now when you when you play the game i'm so lost it's
it's the voices the most what's happening the voices are

4769
04:56:50,600 --> 04:56:51,580
talking to me

4770
04:56:55,720 --> 04:57:08,560
i i saved myself i saved myself we need to set up the guy i
saved myself control you if he walks the highfields.

4771
04:57:09,420 --> 04:57:12,360
By shooting you out and then you're going to start out a
little side off.

4772
04:57:12,720 --> 04:57:14,920
This is something as an opportunity that you can take.

4773
04:57:15,120 --> 04:57:16,500
And the same thing applies to my Phoenix.

4774
04:57:16,900 --> 04:57:21,520
My Phoenix and you could take the high ground here and you
would have infinite pressure behind.

4775
04:57:22,360 --> 04:57:23,320
There's no downside.

4776
04:57:23,500 --> 04:57:24,480
No one can control you.

4777
04:57:24,620 --> 04:57:25,980
Mag can't just blue attack on the head.

4778
04:57:26,060 --> 04:57:26,960
The hell doesn't happen.

4779
04:57:27,060 --> 04:57:29,480
That's the only thing you can do in 4k to counter it.

4780
04:57:29,520 --> 04:57:29,900
You know?

4781
04:57:30,280 --> 04:57:32,780
You kind of need to contact it.

4782
04:57:32,880 --> 04:57:33,980
Because otherwise you just lose the game.

4783
04:57:34,060 --> 04:57:36,180
How do you control full HP Phoenix behind it?

4784
04:57:36,180 --> 04:57:36,820
Paragones behind.

4785
04:57:36,900 --> 04:57:38,900
We just instantly lose.

4786
04:57:40,980 --> 04:57:43,140
I even started going up there, but I just went back to that.

4787
04:57:43,940 --> 04:57:48,300
These are small additions in game plan that can change the
entire fight.

4788
04:57:48,480 --> 04:57:48,520
You know?

4789
04:57:49,580 --> 04:57:50,900
Yeah, that is good to go that way.

4790
04:57:51,160 --> 04:57:51,360
It's okay.

4791
04:57:51,740 --> 04:57:52,340
You know, it happens.

4792
04:57:52,760 --> 04:57:53,500
We win the next fight.

4793
04:57:54,000 --> 04:57:54,780
The fight itself is good.

4794
04:57:54,940 --> 04:57:56,500
Here was the hook that you wanted to talk about.

4795
04:57:56,800 --> 04:57:59,360
Duck, we can look at it.

4796
04:57:59,560 --> 04:58:00,680
He's coming back.

4797
04:58:01,360 --> 04:58:02,060
For sure, a good hook.

4798
04:58:02,260 --> 04:58:02,980
It's on the back.

4799
04:58:03,800 --> 04:58:05,200
Everyone is like, we need to kill.

4800
04:58:05,200 --> 04:58:05,240
We need to kill.

4801
04:58:05,280 --> 04:58:05,980
We need to kill now.

4802
04:58:06,900 --> 04:58:08,000
We're rotating with her.

4803
04:58:09,220 --> 04:58:10,460
And our comp is to fade to die.

4804
04:58:11,660 --> 04:58:12,580
Who's supposed to kill him?

4805
04:58:12,680 --> 04:58:13,400
What the fuck?

4806
04:58:13,680 --> 04:58:15,120
Who's fucking killing the fuck?

4807
04:58:16,500 --> 04:58:18,840
The force land force is optimal.

4808
04:58:19,240 --> 04:58:19,640
It's huge.

4809
04:58:20,260 --> 04:58:21,920
But this guy had 500 HP.

4810
04:58:22,300 --> 04:58:23,500
Who is supposed to kill him?

4811
04:58:24,180 --> 04:58:25,140
Six times.

4812
04:58:26,400 --> 04:58:28,040
What more can we get out of this?

4813
04:58:28,120 --> 04:58:28,660
This is optimal.

4814
04:58:29,220 --> 04:58:30,620
We get everything we want out of this.

4815
04:58:30,960 --> 04:58:31,860
It eventually leads to...

4816
04:58:31,860 --> 04:58:32,780
God, I couldn't do anything.

4817
04:58:33,580 --> 04:58:36,640
I was getting fucking picked everywhere.

4818
04:58:36,900 --> 04:58:45,620
so this is great anyone even tried a cp we can't get more of
this we get big wall too optimally right we wait a bit this

4819
04:58:45,620 --> 04:58:52,980
is shameless where y'all go we need the flank you still have
like not developed any flank i literally get late you did

4820
04:58:52,980 --> 04:59:01,180
like five damage on the dude every fight for zero like
drawback right there's there's nothing yeah i'm holding my

4821
04:59:01,180 --> 04:59:05,960
held site for legit over two minutes this is something like
maybe three because once more we have the same position.

4822
04:59:06,360 --> 04:59:08,140
There is no drawback on you going top.

4823
04:59:08,320 --> 04:59:09,180
You can't be a contestant.

4824
04:59:09,800 --> 04:59:10,960
I should have called it too.

4825
04:59:11,520 --> 04:59:13,800
I have to call it off.

4826
04:59:14,080 --> 04:59:17,600
It's also very hard to micro everyone in between, but I
should be better at it for sure.

4827
04:59:18,400 --> 04:59:19,160
Overall, this land is good.

4828
04:59:19,380 --> 04:59:22,400
We force resources away, but I am so scared.

4829
04:59:23,440 --> 04:59:25,700
Oh, see that.

4830
04:59:26,440 --> 04:59:27,460
I did that.

4831
04:59:28,540 --> 04:59:29,240
I did that.

4832
04:59:29,320 --> 04:59:37,520
Overall, it's great that you force stuff right it's that i
didn't mention me yet you also took that that's usually an

4833
04:59:37,520 --> 04:59:46,000
indicator too overall fine we get enough we get a neutral
fight venom is good puts pressure on the backline we

4834
04:59:46,000 --> 04:59:51,640
actually end up killing flu which was great you know i think
venom is one of the strongest rules in the game and very

4835
04:59:51,640 --> 04:59:57,340
under i g uh very good to captain is doing a bad review i
can't

4836
05:00:01,120 --> 05:00:02,040
Pay attention.

4837
05:00:03,400 --> 05:00:04,740
Next fight, same position.

4838
05:00:05,180 --> 05:00:06,240
This is a problem now.

4839
05:00:06,760 --> 05:00:07,640
They have Groodels.

4840
05:00:08,180 --> 05:00:10,960
Groodels is a very large win condition for them against our
Cork.

4841
05:00:11,540 --> 05:00:15,020
We need to have counterplay against that by putting our
pressure on the backline.

4842
05:00:15,720 --> 05:00:18,660
So that the Grood becomes isolated when he actually ends up
ulting.

4843
05:00:19,040 --> 05:00:21,560
So my backline doesn't die through the support.

4844
05:00:22,260 --> 05:00:24,000
What we do right now is kind of good.

4845
05:00:24,540 --> 05:00:25,620
We have Phoenix on the high ground.

4846
05:00:26,000 --> 05:00:27,140
We have me on the high ground.

4847
05:00:27,940 --> 05:00:29,640
And we obviously want to drop on them.

4848
05:00:31,160 --> 05:00:41,360
weeping he's not definitely he's just he's actually like
good night since you want to be able to see me from me since

4849
05:00:41,360 --> 05:00:47,740
i'm a more it's better to play all right i'll okay i'll do
like in the in future

4850
05:00:52,400 --> 05:00:59,560
calculate the situation what it's looking like and then yeah
start We want to calculate the situation before and then we

4851
05:00:59,560 --> 05:00:59,880
drop.

4852
05:01:00,280 --> 05:01:01,400
Yeah, I'll try a little.

4853
05:01:02,140 --> 05:01:02,760
Situation is good.

4854
05:01:03,160 --> 05:01:04,720
Loki could have died once more.

4855
05:01:05,280 --> 05:01:06,400
This is a mechanical issue.

4856
05:01:06,800 --> 05:01:08,980
And this is where aim actually better for both.

4857
05:01:09,000 --> 05:01:09,620
Oh, my.

4858
05:01:10,720 --> 05:01:12,240
And this guy will be good.

4859
05:01:12,660 --> 05:01:14,940
And if we create more situations like this.

4860
05:01:15,160 --> 05:01:15,840
Shoot penny out.

4861
05:01:15,900 --> 05:01:16,860
Shoot penny out.

4862
05:01:16,920 --> 05:01:17,200
Shoot penny out.

4863
05:01:17,240 --> 05:01:17,500
Shoot penny.

4864
05:01:17,620 --> 05:01:18,540
Look how much we force.

4865
05:01:18,800 --> 05:01:19,320
We force land.

4866
05:01:19,380 --> 05:01:19,760
Shoot penny.

4867
05:01:20,380 --> 05:01:21,080
Focus penny.

4868
05:01:21,240 --> 05:01:21,600
Focus penny.

4869
05:01:21,720 --> 05:01:23,800
And it's up to us now how we play after.

4870
05:01:24,400 --> 05:01:25,300
This is my fault.

4871
05:01:25,480 --> 05:01:25,660
There we go.

4872
05:01:25,840 --> 05:01:26,880
Because we get to this side now.

4873
05:01:27,060 --> 05:01:27,820
Look Penny again.

4874
05:01:27,900 --> 05:01:28,560
Let's go out.

4875
05:01:28,680 --> 05:01:30,080
Obviously we should go out.

4876
05:01:30,340 --> 05:01:30,620
Kill Penny.

4877
05:01:31,000 --> 05:01:31,140
Kill Penny.

4878
05:01:31,260 --> 05:01:31,920
You should focus on him.

4879
05:01:31,960 --> 05:01:32,140
There you go.

4880
05:01:32,220 --> 05:01:32,960
Now kill him.

4881
05:01:33,320 --> 05:01:33,400
Kill him.

4882
05:01:36,180 --> 05:01:37,140
You stay in.

4883
05:01:37,280 --> 05:01:37,960
So you lose HP.

4884
05:01:38,420 --> 05:01:38,920
Push cart.

4885
05:01:38,920 --> 05:01:39,200
Push cart.

4886
05:01:39,680 --> 05:01:40,000
We need three.

4887
05:01:40,140 --> 05:01:40,440
We need three.

4888
05:01:40,580 --> 05:01:40,880
We need three.

4889
05:01:41,780 --> 05:01:41,960
Again.

4890
05:01:42,280 --> 05:01:45,580
Because going out now with 800 HP or 600 HP that you have
left.

4891
05:01:46,100 --> 05:01:49,040
And then hitting after right after would create more
potential.

4892
05:01:49,440 --> 05:01:49,960
I am here.

4893
05:01:50,300 --> 05:01:51,060
You also get hooked.

4894
05:01:52,000 --> 05:01:52,320
And you die.

4895
05:01:52,340 --> 05:01:53,320
We're going to walk with my rocket launcher.

4896
05:01:54,240 --> 05:01:57,300
This is like, but it's common, you know, so did Argo.

4897
05:01:57,580 --> 05:01:58,920
I mean, as hard as it sounds.

4898
05:01:59,660 --> 05:02:00,500
Argo went in.

4899
05:02:00,740 --> 05:02:00,940
Start.

4900
05:02:01,120 --> 05:02:01,540
It's good.

4901
05:02:02,060 --> 05:02:02,360
Start.

4902
05:02:03,360 --> 05:02:05,560
Now you're behind them.

4903
05:02:06,000 --> 05:02:07,380
Always focus on right.

4904
05:02:09,100 --> 05:02:10,100
Did they see that?

4905
05:02:10,680 --> 05:02:11,660
You should develop.

4906
05:02:12,000 --> 05:02:12,460
Push them away, guys.

4907
05:02:12,820 --> 05:02:13,720
Phoenix to the right.

4908
05:02:13,860 --> 05:02:16,100
And right-hand peek is so important in this game.

4909
05:02:16,220 --> 05:02:16,540
She's still here.

4910
05:02:17,300 --> 05:02:19,420
You see 25% on the left screen.

4911
05:02:20,100 --> 05:02:22,200
And you see 75% on the right screen.

4912
05:02:22,200 --> 05:02:24,500
and the weapon hits from the right side as well.

4913
05:02:24,620 --> 05:02:26,080
So there's no drawback on it.

4914
05:02:26,080 --> 05:02:31,440
Peaking from the left side only makes it harder for you to
flange and get out because he gets to headshot more than he

4915
05:02:31,440 --> 05:02:31,840
gets to headshot.

4916
05:02:31,900 --> 05:02:32,680
I'm going to walk up a little bit.

4917
05:02:32,740 --> 05:02:33,100
Phoenix right.

4918
05:02:33,140 --> 05:02:33,480
Phoenix right.

4919
05:02:34,060 --> 05:02:34,060
Phoenix right.

4920
05:02:34,060 --> 05:02:34,600
She's looking for a flank.

4921
05:02:35,100 --> 05:02:36,020
Position lost.

4922
05:02:36,020 --> 05:02:36,660
She's looking.

4923
05:02:36,860 --> 05:02:37,060
She's looking.

4924
05:02:37,060 --> 05:02:37,180
She's blanking.

4925
05:02:37,280 --> 05:02:37,660
She's blanking.

4926
05:02:37,740 --> 05:02:38,420
We loon all.

4927
05:02:38,560 --> 05:02:42,980
If the loon all is maybe too early, you know, overall, we
obviously want to try to kill three of them.

4928
05:02:43,880 --> 05:02:44,780
It ends up happening.

4929
05:02:44,780 --> 05:02:44,820
We're good.

4930
05:02:44,920 --> 05:02:45,160
We're good.

4931
05:02:45,620 --> 05:02:46,960
We can use invis to last fight.

4932
05:02:47,100 --> 05:02:47,400
Look, Phoenix.

4933
05:02:47,400 --> 05:02:47,920
Phoenix, free kill.

4934
05:02:47,980 --> 05:02:48,620
Phoenix, free kill above.

4935
05:02:48,740 --> 05:02:51,160
This is the invisible that is deep, somewhat deep, right?

4936
05:02:51,180 --> 05:02:52,180
It could still be a bit better.

4937
05:02:52,200 --> 05:02:55,520
I think we have to go now we have to go now we need to go
now.

4938
05:02:55,640 --> 05:02:58,160
I guess they were afraid of the Phoenix game Which is good.

4939
05:02:58,300 --> 05:02:59,360
This is what we want to force.

4940
05:02:59,500 --> 05:03:00,540
We want to force mistakes.

4941
05:03:00,660 --> 05:03:06,660
Now we should focus on living this Right That end up being
into the enemy team.

4942
05:03:06,740 --> 05:03:08,940
I don't know if you get picked or not Why did he swap?

4943
05:03:09,140 --> 05:03:17,660
You should probably ult out here I think I tried to my all
got cancelled Yeah, I don't even know what it got cancelled

4944
05:03:17,660 --> 05:03:24,200
by What if it can cancel invisible cancels bug you all
that's great I thought it looked like my grow coat.

4945
05:03:29,540 --> 05:03:30,840
Yeah, he's pro.

4946
05:03:32,440 --> 05:03:33,040
He's the pro.

4947
05:03:33,480 --> 05:03:34,400
Oh, it was not in this pool.

4948
05:03:35,340 --> 05:03:35,940
Oh, Phoenix stun.

4949
05:03:36,640 --> 05:03:38,100
Yeah, I won.

4950
05:03:38,920 --> 05:03:39,900
As far as I'm aware.

4951
05:03:40,320 --> 05:03:41,560
Yeah, that's me.

4952
05:03:44,180 --> 05:03:46,200
But then, I don't know what it can cancel by.

4953
05:03:48,320 --> 05:03:49,620
Yeah, I remember.

4954
05:03:50,200 --> 05:03:51,300
Okay, you're dead.

4955
05:03:51,720 --> 05:04:01,540
We can still win next situation now this is my problem i
need to have the development from my phoenix here because

4956
05:04:01,540 --> 05:04:11,160
you played not the right not the right not the left side now
it's harder for you to retake what the fuck he's so tiny oh

4957
05:04:11,160 --> 05:04:19,880
my god now you've been late to the hits you're also look at
how tiny is now they get to react there's no pressure right

4958
05:04:19,880 --> 05:04:26,700
now look at him and you hit at the same time snake is also
right now we have a serious chance of turning the fight what

4959
05:04:26,700 --> 05:04:33,260
do you there's so many opportunities that we can create for
ourselves to turn fights like this but because you show

4960
05:04:33,260 --> 05:04:38,880
yourself early and it's not deep enough because you can't go
as deep as you want now he gets to turn and now they get to

4961
05:04:38,880 --> 05:04:45,940
back away from you and to control you now he's coming and
now you're going back you see the synergy we are the same

4962
05:04:45,940 --> 05:04:56,780
way and that happens so many times i follow this daddy jeff
and which would be way stronger in this position or in most

4963
05:04:56,780 --> 05:05:05,080
positions so now snake has goes in pulls great force once
more same situation it's in our hands now we need to get out

4964
05:05:05,080 --> 05:05:13,520
and then after that we hit the phoenix with flank you go
into them they all die daddy who's my daddy where did he go

4965
05:05:13,520 --> 05:05:22,280
where did my daddy we call to live okay you know here's what
about comboing like what about comboing phoenix let them for

4966
05:05:22,280 --> 05:05:30,840
the glass fight no he disappeared my son if we see the
opportunity for it the problem is we didn't my son you know

4967
05:05:30,840 --> 05:05:39,380
it's okay and they also have it's not like it's on counter a
little guys our cycles are more important and the way in the

4968
05:05:39,380 --> 05:05:48,920
synergy around the neutral is way i lost him in ikea which
tiny mantis and there's a parent oh my god look at how he's

4969
05:05:48,920 --> 05:05:59,440
so tiny look at him very important is to go up further you
should listen to my call i say i touch at the edge so oh

4970
05:05:59,440 --> 05:06:06,480
yeah i just because you end up dying here my shield as well
it's just once again now our hit is just not less hard you

4971
05:06:06,480 --> 05:06:12,200
know obviously we want to hit it's also okay to give flip in
this position because it last fight in theory we can live

4972
05:06:12,200 --> 05:06:22,120
here yeah this is why i give flip right i touch until i give
flip and if we had full hp venom now with my engage here we

4973
05:06:22,120 --> 05:06:29,200
can turn the fight so we can also call now maybe we give him
lift and don't give it heights and then we innocent deep

4974
05:06:29,200 --> 05:06:35,760
invisible deep now and the only response is mac it's which
is very easy countable because all of us have either sought

4975
05:06:35,760 --> 05:06:44,520
or or a cooldown where we don't feed the mac oh they eat the
thing not the mag but kill the kill the backlight right if

4976
05:06:44,520 --> 05:06:51,440
we invisible deep here still fine incomplet not deep on the
backline so it's just not good enough we can put we can't

4977
05:06:51,440 --> 05:06:55,620
get anything out of this other than building more time to
reset another dive.

4978
05:06:56,420 --> 05:06:57,420
Meanwhile, Argo dies.

4979
05:06:58,160 --> 05:06:58,940
Question is, how does he die?

4980
05:06:59,600 --> 05:07:00,300
He's looking at it.

4981
05:07:00,380 --> 05:07:02,100
Okay, I just need Invis on Deeper.

4982
05:07:02,520 --> 05:07:03,460
You tried to touch, right?

4983
05:07:03,940 --> 05:07:04,480
Or whatever.

4984
05:07:04,980 --> 05:07:07,440
You walk in from the left side so you don't see what's
happening on the screen.

4985
05:07:07,540 --> 05:07:09,060
Alright, that's all I need to do.

4986
05:07:09,080 --> 05:07:10,140
Invis on Deeper.

4987
05:07:10,880 --> 05:07:12,480
You shoot the dude for zero damage.

4988
05:07:13,040 --> 05:07:14,100
Because no one puts a P pressure.

4989
05:07:14,320 --> 05:07:15,380
We can't get anything out of this.

4990
05:07:15,640 --> 05:07:20,040
The only thing we can gain is for the Invis to look away for
two seconds, which doesn't give us anything.

4991
05:07:20,260 --> 05:07:27,800
The only thing it does is It like forces away the chance of
your hit to be stronger, right?

4992
05:07:28,180 --> 05:07:33,820
Because obviously you want to go in, then shift in, right
click the floor and one shot them.

4993
05:07:34,060 --> 05:07:37,960
You try to touch with ult and now our ult economy is lost.

4994
05:07:38,540 --> 05:07:39,580
So now we can hit with the ult.

4995
05:07:42,360 --> 05:07:43,620
The invisible is the same, right?

4996
05:07:43,980 --> 05:07:45,480
It can also be deeper in the enemy team.

4997
05:07:46,080 --> 05:07:52,840
And then when Snake is still alive, because you could have
played to live, in their backline and they can win.

4998
05:07:54,520 --> 05:07:56,700
Now you guys see the infinite opportunities I meant.

4999
05:07:57,080 --> 05:08:00,300
We still are able to get a lot of it back though.

5000
05:08:00,840 --> 05:08:02,640
Even though Argo died, look at what happens.

5001
05:08:03,440 --> 05:08:11,060
We still have an opportunity to win because we kill Cooper,
which he kind of died because Gator just zombie walked

5002
05:08:11,780 --> 05:08:17,680
somewhere else on the map when he should have just played in
front to block the resources so his backline doesn't get

5003
05:08:17,680 --> 05:08:17,900
shot.

5004
05:08:18,520 --> 05:08:19,960
Now we chill, he bubbled it.

5005
05:08:20,080 --> 05:08:20,500
This is good.

5006
05:08:21,560 --> 05:08:27,300
the adam on flank flank luna and we push the invest and we
kill the invest

5007
05:08:30,420 --> 05:08:38,200
this is kind of unlucky dark that that happens to be honest
it's also unlucky that we die it's also double unlucky here

5008
05:08:38,200 --> 05:08:45,040
that we don't focus on living very important here once more
is to focus on living and in situations like this you should

5009
05:08:45,040 --> 05:08:52,840
always try to tp into the enemy team like deep cut the
healing to the enemy back cut the healing like the tp needs

5010
05:08:52,840 --> 05:09:03,860
to be over here what's happening on the screen over you this
is how i process my bot reviews obviously it's unlucky they

5011
05:09:03,860 --> 05:09:08,340
had adam but there was infinite situations where we could
have played better earlier where it would have given us much

5012
05:09:08,340 --> 05:09:17,020
better chances we have tp we're all back right their crude
actually ends up dying so this is was it all he got rose he

5013
05:09:17,020 --> 05:09:25,220
does end up dying you know now we should be able to wipe we
should like never like this fight here feels so sad to lose

5014
05:09:25,220 --> 05:09:32,140
because we had good resources now they're in result so we
should just respect the in result and live which we end up

5015
05:09:32,140 --> 05:09:40,540
doing and we get hooked and die very unlucky that crew gets
hooked same same kind of issue he had 92 old it was

5016
05:09:40,540 --> 05:09:44,620
preventable it's his mistake there for sure he shouldn't die

5017
05:09:47,660 --> 05:09:53,440
very important is now this is like a position all or nothing
kind of so we need to push inside of them you can tell that

5018
05:09:53,440 --> 05:09:58,940
but we don't really push that deep so i have to go out and
now doki get bird gets pushed uncontested and just dies

5019
05:09:58,940 --> 05:10:05,560
which she can't she can't do anything against yeah but like
there are so many situations where we needed my step was

5020
05:10:05,560 --> 05:10:14,600
like unavoidable so there's nothing to critique there but i
guess you get most of it there's like so many stuff was i

5021
05:10:14,600 --> 05:10:26,940
out of the line or was it okay i didn't mean to one it was
just like it's just how i always do it okay good we did it

5022
05:10:26,940 --> 05:10:34,220
yeah i'll be right back most of the blame was on our dps
let's go i think it should be too

5023
05:10:39,120 --> 05:10:48,660
my only critique which i should look deeper that was an
actual lecture well yeah i did it Anyone take notes?

5024
05:10:49,960 --> 05:10:50,920
Yeah, I take notes.

5025
05:10:53,000 --> 05:10:53,720
Of course.

5026
05:10:55,720 --> 05:10:56,620
What are you saying, Tristan?

5027
05:10:57,780 --> 05:10:59,340
Only minor criticisms.

5028
05:11:00,120 --> 05:11:01,800
We're all here to learn, we're all here to play.

5029
05:11:04,980 --> 05:11:05,880
There's no doubt.

5030
05:11:06,060 --> 05:11:09,280
If you don't want to participate in this, you're also not
forced to or anything.

5031
05:11:09,920 --> 05:11:11,740
It's a fun tournament at the end of the day.

5032
05:11:12,860 --> 05:11:13,160
Yay!

5033
05:11:14,500 --> 05:11:15,680
I want to get better, I want to get better.

5034
05:11:17,040 --> 05:11:17,640
Try and improve.

5035
05:11:18,480 --> 05:11:21,920
I mean, that's what we want, you know, we all want to get
better.

5036
05:11:24,100 --> 05:11:25,600
Did Krook seriously take a nap now?

5037
05:11:25,940 --> 05:11:26,620
I think so.

5038
05:11:26,880 --> 05:11:27,620
He said, wait.

5039
05:11:27,620 --> 05:11:28,120
He might have, yeah.

5040
05:11:28,880 --> 05:11:30,960
Wait, but then like he's the captain though.

5041
05:11:31,780 --> 05:11:33,280
No, this isn't a fourth one tournament.

5042
05:11:33,700 --> 05:11:34,920
This means everything to me.

5043
05:11:35,800 --> 05:11:36,400
It's for money.

5044
05:11:37,860 --> 05:11:38,260
Yeah.

5045
05:11:38,720 --> 05:11:39,360
This is everything.

5046
05:11:40,640 --> 05:11:41,460
It means everything?

5047
05:11:42,080 --> 05:11:43,140
It means everything.

5048
05:11:44,720 --> 05:11:45,420
Oh yeah, it means everything.

5049
05:11:45,420 --> 05:11:46,780
Oh yeah, I need to think we need a cop drop.

5050
05:11:46,940 --> 05:11:47,440
I like it.

5051
05:11:47,660 --> 05:12:03,460
I didn't cry guys that's that's a plus I didn't cry I got
constructive criticism I didn't cry that's a win wait it

5052
05:12:03,460 --> 05:12:15,330
should be that's a fucking win in my book I'm checking the
oh my god how many more okay wait what percentage rank game

5053
05:12:15,330 --> 05:12:20,090
now or not you already need to do something there's five
it's 5 30.

5054
05:12:21,530 --> 05:12:29,690
i'd imagine it starts soon when is the match tell you where
why you are around three started at 5 30 so it's been almost

5055
05:12:29,690 --> 05:12:42,850
two hours there's no way two hours for it for two games
isn't it of what no what what normally normally in my what

5056
05:12:42,850 --> 05:12:48,370
do you call me out for i prepared Now I didn't do that so
normally it goes a bit quicker.

5057
05:12:48,470 --> 05:12:48,810
I don't know.

5058
05:12:49,010 --> 05:12:50,130
Why did he call me out?

5059
05:12:57,770 --> 05:13:04,550
It's probably because of scheduling, you know, because like
some people some team started late like Who called me out

5060
05:13:04,550 --> 05:13:05,850
who was it?

5061
05:13:06,090 --> 05:13:12,510
I didn't notice two of them have like very similar voices I
would say Ago and snake have like really similar voices.

5062
05:13:12,650 --> 05:13:18,870
So I can't tell who called me up We saw me at the club.

5063
05:13:19,090 --> 05:13:19,390
What's wrong?

5064
05:13:19,610 --> 05:13:20,670
Don't fucking judge.

5065
05:13:27,890 --> 05:13:28,310
Robin's streaming.

5066
05:13:28,910 --> 05:13:29,450
Robin's streaming.

5067
05:13:31,510 --> 05:13:33,030
It's been five hours.

5068
05:13:34,170 --> 05:13:36,330
Do you think we could even play against them?

5069
05:13:36,850 --> 05:13:37,450
I don't think so.

5070
05:13:38,550 --> 05:13:45,090
I mean, the only way it can happen is if they lose a match,
if they lose a match, then we can face against them.

5071
05:13:45,110 --> 05:13:59,890
or if the next thing would be if there's like four people or
five people five people with five one score and we have a

5072
05:13:59,890 --> 05:14:13,390
four I explained it earlier so bad at it let's say there's
five people with five one score then they can face the with

5073
05:14:13,390 --> 05:14:26,270
a 5-2 score in example by because one one guy can't face a
5-1 score yeah yeah it's an uneven number no we're not

5074
05:14:26,270 --> 05:14:34,790
against terror that was bait we're not against terror yes
I'm a nervous P again I'll be a boss the new knowledge we

5075
05:14:34,790 --> 05:14:44,630
gained terror would be would be cooked anyway I need to not
be I don't know I If you're so rushed to dive sometimes,

5076
05:14:45,050 --> 05:14:46,230
like I'm not on a clock.

5077
05:14:46,770 --> 05:14:53,570
Yeah, usually like normally with flanks and with off angles,
the best tip I can give is like actually looking behind to

5078
05:14:53,570 --> 05:14:54,670
see who's actually playing.

5079
05:14:55,690 --> 05:14:56,810
Yeah, who's ready for me?

5080
05:14:57,010 --> 05:14:58,510
Who's ready for my dive, my team?

5081
05:14:59,870 --> 05:14:59,950
Yeah.

5082
05:15:00,030 --> 05:15:03,790
Obviously you can create a situation where your team can be
easier to walk up.

5083
05:15:03,910 --> 05:15:04,830
That's what I like to do.

5084
05:15:05,170 --> 05:15:10,210
When my team is not ready in pro play, I like to like dive
in and instantly go out because it makes all the enemies

5085
05:15:10,210 --> 05:15:12,610
turn, which gives us time to set up the hip much better.

5086
05:15:13,350 --> 05:15:15,310
without me losing anything for it, you know?

5087
05:15:15,950 --> 05:15:19,430
This is like the secret trust me tech to winning worlds.

5088
05:15:22,250 --> 05:15:23,310
Yeah, I see, I see.

5089
05:15:32,310 --> 05:15:32,990
I'm back.

5090
05:15:33,130 --> 05:15:34,550
I don't finish my chicken nuggets.

5091
05:15:35,170 --> 05:15:37,730
Well, I finished it when we were fighting that diamond team.

5092
05:15:39,050 --> 05:15:41,250
Guys, do you think I can risk a rank game?

5093
05:15:41,470 --> 05:15:43,890
Guys, I'm gonna do it.

5094
05:15:44,070 --> 05:15:44,290
You know what?

5095
05:15:44,310 --> 05:15:45,110
I'll do a quick play game.

5096
05:15:45,230 --> 05:15:46,230
This quickly is bad.

5097
05:15:46,710 --> 05:15:48,070
I'm gonna do a quick play game.

5098
05:15:49,890 --> 05:15:52,250
I'm gonna death in.

5099
05:15:52,530 --> 05:15:54,170
And then no more voices, guys.

5100
05:15:55,170 --> 05:15:56,010
No more voices.

5101
05:15:57,570 --> 05:15:59,530
I need some jingle jangles right now.

5102
05:16:02,610 --> 05:16:03,830
I need some jingle jangles.

5103
05:16:03,990 --> 05:16:05,990
I need some stimulation to the brain.

5104
05:16:08,530 --> 05:16:14,610
Oh, but if I win a game right now, if I win a game right
now, I'd be Celestio.

5105
05:16:15,650 --> 05:16:18,210

05:19:34,290 --> 05:19:37,230
If you think about it, I'm technically like the widow.

5127
05:19:38,030 --> 05:19:40,110
Hawkeye is like another form of widow.

5128
05:19:41,230 --> 05:19:42,970
Are we actually gonna keep fighting this?

5129
05:19:43,470 --> 05:19:44,170
Because nope.

5130
05:19:48,170 --> 05:19:48,470
Hello.

5131
05:19:50,890 --> 05:19:51,970

05:19:56,240 --> 05:19:56,280

5139
05:20:37,320 --> 05:20:38,020
Hey, I got 2k.

5140
05:20:38,940 --> 05:20:40,120

05:20:44,260 --> 05:20:45,620
Not 05.

5142
05:20:46,880 --> 05:20:47,400

5143
05:20:50,320 --> 05:20:52,140
No longer 05.

5144
05:20:56,250 --> 05:20:57,090
What the fuck?

5145
05:21:01,960 --> 05:21:03,620
Oh my god, he's actually one.

5146
05:21:04,300 --> 05:21:05,020
That's crazy.

5147
05:21:09,930 --> 05:21:11,710
Come on, show me.

5148
05:21:12,010 --> 05:21:13,110
Show me that hand.

5149
05:21:17,660 --> 05:21:18,580
Here we go.

5150
05:21:21,800 --> 05:21:22,840
Oh, fuck.

5151
05:21:23,260 --> 05:21:24,460
Wait, I'm actually doing...

5152
05:21:24,460 --> 05:21:25,220
Oh, I'm fine.

5153
05:21:25,300 --> 05:21:26,380
I'm actually doing shit.

5154
05:21:27,580 --> 05:21:29,920
Alright, I guess I should play an actual hero.

5155
05:21:30,080 --> 05:21:31,020
I know how to play.

5156
05:21:32,380 --> 05:21:33,000
Eh, fuck it.

5157
05:21:33,020 --> 05:21:34,640
They're going through it, might as well.

5158
05:21:34,740 --> 05:21:35,900
It's called a duty time.

5159
05:21:47,250 --> 05:21:48,090
What the fuck?

5160
05:21:48,950 --> 05:21:49,550
I keep forgetting.

5161
05:21:55,980 --> 05:21:57,120
Okay, maybe...

5162
05:21:57,140 --> 05:22:04,100
Maybe I should just play Hawkeye Wait, wait, wait, I'm
almost at 80 though.

5163
05:22:04,220 --> 05:22:05,140
I'm almost 80.

5164
05:22:06,400 --> 05:22:07,260
I'm John Rivals.

5165
05:22:07,800 --> 05:22:11,260
Oh, goodbye I am John Rivals

5166
05:22:17,580 --> 05:22:18,140

5167
05:22:20,600 --> 05:22:27,240
Don't worry the rare DPS stream I'm too scared to come up
here.

5168
05:22:27,520 --> 05:22:29,520
I fucking knew it fucking knew it.

Okay, it's time to go, though.

5173
05:23:05,600 --> 05:23:06,620
Yeah, that's fine.

5174
05:23:10,780 --> 05:23:12,120

5175
05:23:13,000 --> 05:23:14,040
Oh, my God.

5176
05:23:14,140 --> 05:23:14,800
You can't kill me.

5177
05:23:14,960 --> 05:23:15,820
I'm in this zone.

5178
05:23:21,470 --> 05:23:22,830
It worked, though.

5179
05:23:25,690 --> 05:23:27,230
What's fucking hilarious?

5180
05:23:27,690 --> 05:23:28,190

5181
05:23:28,190 --> 05:23:29,110
Can't believe that worked.

5182
05:23:31,170 --> 05:23:32,370

5183
05:23:32,530 --> 05:23:33,150

5199
05:25:23,690 --> 05:25:26,230
I'm not letting that tree play the game.

Stop, stop!

5202
05:25:31,430 --> 05:25:32,330
What's the point?

5203
05:25:33,150 --> 05:25:33,470
Bro!

5204
05:25:36,660 --> 05:25:37,720
Flynn's punishing!

5205
05:25:39,940 --> 05:25:42,920
There's no meaning no more!

5206
05:25:49,780 --> 05:25:52,140
Bro, that guy's fucking dead.

5207
05:25:56,720 --> 05:25:57,400
Worth it.

5208
05:26:01,720 --> 05:26:03,860

05:26:05,240 --> 05:26:12,330

goodbye we got work talking out honestly It went better than
I expected.

5212
05:26:43,190 --> 05:26:44,470
Did not think that would work.

5213
05:26:51,580 --> 05:26:52,140
That's fine.

5214
05:26:52,240 --> 05:26:53,240
I got one, guys.

5215
05:26:57,780 --> 05:26:59,460
I don't think we're winning this, though.

5216
05:27:00,880 --> 05:27:02,620
Unless we do have Rocket Up.

5217
05:27:03,480 --> 05:27:06,120
With Rocket Up, I could just stand in my turret for it.

5218
05:27:10,080 --> 05:27:10,640
Oh.

5219
05:27:13,800 --> 05:27:15,620
It's pressing fire.

5220
05:27:21,500 --> 05:27:22,340
Suppressing fire!

5221
05:27:26,670 --> 05:27:27,570
Suppressing fire!

5222
05:27:29,530 --> 05:27:30,930
Okay, it didn't work though.

5223
05:27:31,190 --> 05:27:31,610
Talking to that.

5224
05:27:32,110 --> 05:27:33,910
That worked out a lot better than I expected.

5225
05:27:39,660 --> 05:27:40,380
Look at that guy.

5226
05:27:43,960 --> 05:27:44,520

We managed to do four games in six hours.

5237
05:28:40,780 --> 05:28:44,540
Our record is three games in seven hours.

5238
05:28:44,840 --> 05:28:51,680
If we can get a fourth game, then it'll be four games in six
hours.

5257
05:30:13,800 --> 05:30:14,620

05:34:10,210 --> 05:34:12,150
It's better for us because we don't face them.

5329
05:34:12,870 --> 05:34:16,490
Yeah, we need them to not get each other and just win
everything.

5330
05:34:16,870 --> 05:34:18,410
No, we will beat them, though.

5331

We progressively got it.

5332
05:34:22,250 --> 05:34:22,670

5357
05:35:47,200 --> 05:35:48,780
My coughs are just...

5358
05:35:48,780 --> 05:35:50,800
My coughs always last forever.

5359
05:35:51,200 --> 05:35:52,420
That's like the worst part.

5360
05:35:54,900 --> 05:35:56,160
Yeah, we move it for tomorrow.

5361
05:35:56,360 --> 05:35:57,940
I may still have the tournament tomorrow.

5362
05:35:59,200 --> 05:36:00,780

5463
05:43:47,370 --> 05:43:48,390
They're on four, Emma.

5464
05:43:48,730 --> 05:43:49,190
Hella funny.

5465
05:43:49,470 --> 05:43:50,270
Just take all the map.

5466
05:43:50,370 --> 05:43:50,950
Take left side.

5467
05:43:51,030 --> 05:43:51,650
Walk out, walk out.

5468
05:43:51,770 --> 05:43:52,270
Just walk out.

5469
05:43:53,090 --> 05:43:53,890
Swing into them.

5470
05:43:54,570 --> 05:43:55,130
Two, one.

5471
05:43:55,230 --> 05:43:56,610
Wait out the soup bubble.

5472
05:43:56,710 --> 05:43:57,390
I'm shooting the Thor.

5473
05:43:57,490 --> 05:43:57,970
Shoot the Thor.

5474
05:43:58,070 --> 05:43:58,450
Shoot the Thor.

5475
05:44:00,210 --> 05:44:02,130
Can you play in front of me in this matchup, Snakes?

5476
05:44:03,030 --> 05:44:03,870
Walk forward on the Emma.

5477
05:44:03,990 --> 05:44:04,350
Kill the Emma.

5478
05:44:04,410 --> 05:44:04,750
Kill the Emma.

5479
05:44:05,290 --> 05:44:06,030
I'll pull the Emma.

5480
05:44:07,510 --> 05:44:08,430
Nice kind of cook.

5481
05:44:08,470 --> 05:44:09,110
This is nothing.

5482
05:44:09,570 --> 05:44:10,350
I thought we were.

5483
05:44:10,830 --> 05:44:10,990
Good!

5484
05:44:12,410 --> 05:44:13,510
Walk forward.

5485
05:44:15,750 --> 05:44:16,130
Walk forward.

5486
05:44:16,130 --> 05:44:16,730
Walk forward.

5487
05:44:16,730 --> 05:44:16,830
Walk forward.

5488
05:44:16,830 --> 05:44:16,970
Walk.

5489
05:44:17,730 --> 05:44:18,250
Keep walking.

5490
05:44:18,550 --> 05:44:18,750
Keep walking.

5491
05:44:18,790 --> 05:44:19,370
I blow him.

5492
05:44:20,470 --> 05:44:21,130
Just kill them.

5493
05:44:21,150 --> 05:44:21,710
Just kill them all.

5494
05:44:21,890 --> 05:44:22,310
Just kill them all.

5495
05:44:23,910 --> 05:44:24,230
Nice.

5496
05:44:24,950 --> 05:44:25,930
No more, no more, no more.

5497
05:44:26,230 --> 05:44:26,510
Okay.

05:44:27,550 --> 05:44:28,610

05:44:29,850 --> 05:44:30,630
They have everything, right?

5501
05:44:32,030 --> 05:44:33,810
I don't think they should be able to build anything.

5502
05:44:34,690 --> 05:44:35,790
We can set it up neutral.

5503
05:44:35,850 --> 05:44:36,630
They don't have anything yet.

5504
05:44:36,930 --> 05:44:37,210

5520
05:45:20,950 --> 05:45:21,870
Don't have it yet.

5521
05:45:22,190 --> 05:45:23,070
I'm getting CC chain.

5522
05:45:24,130 --> 05:45:25,010
I'm altering now.

5523
05:45:25,390 --> 05:45:25,770
Where are they going?

5524
05:45:26,050 --> 05:45:26,970
Where they're going?

5525
05:45:29,370 --> 05:45:30,570
Cloak, Cloak, Cloak.

5526
05:45:30,710 --> 05:45:31,170
Break, break, break.

05:45:31,670 --> 05:45:33,410
Break, break.

Steak Emma.

5532
05:45:37,650 --> 05:45:40,830
We need a snack as jelly peanut for the content!

5533
05:45:40,830 --> 05:45:44,650
I sliced them across the map.

5534
05:45:46,890 --> 05:45:48,990
I tried to go for an axe when I played.

5535
05:45:49,790 --> 05:45:50,950
Shoot them a lot.

5536
05:45:51,690 --> 05:45:52,690
They have nothing to walk with.

5537
05:45:53,570 --> 05:45:54,450
That's true, that's true.

5538
05:45:55,130 --> 05:45:56,190
They use every supply.

5539
05:45:56,410 --> 05:45:57,270
They won't be into them.

5540
05:45:58,250 --> 05:45:59,430
No, no, we just wait, we just wait.

5541
05:46:00,090 --> 05:46:02,410
Actually, we can walk in, but yeah, let's do it.

5542
05:46:03,390 --> 05:46:04,110
Can we walk?

5543
05:46:04,430 --> 05:46:04,430
Ready?

5544
05:46:04,730 --> 05:46:05,690
Three, three, one.

5545
05:46:06,650 --> 05:46:07,070
Emma, kill Emma.

5546
05:46:07,350 --> 05:46:07,770
Emma and four.

5547
05:46:07,930 --> 05:46:09,290
Emma one, Thor one, Thor one.

5548
05:46:11,570 --> 05:46:12,830
Honey one, honey one, honey one, honey one.

5549
05:46:13,650 --> 05:46:13,950
Nice.

5550
05:46:28,090 --> 05:46:28,610
Soldier.

5551
05:46:29,210 --> 05:46:31,170
Cosmic rays didn't make me who I am today.

5552
05:46:31,890 --> 05:46:33,010
My family did.

5553
05:46:40,800 --> 05:46:41,120
Yay.

5554
05:46:42,480 --> 05:46:44,260
30 seconds before you attack.

5555
05:46:44,640 --> 05:46:46,260
The silence is on the fields.

5556
05:46:47,240 --> 05:46:47,540
Rise.

5557
05:46:49,420 --> 05:46:51,380
Oh, you guys are all not saying anything.

5558
05:46:51,620 --> 05:46:52,100
I swear to you.

5559
05:46:52,120 --> 05:46:53,440
I say everyone.

5560
05:46:53,660 --> 05:46:55,380
I think everyone's just hella tired.

5561
05:46:55,920 --> 05:46:57,860
No, you guys are Americans.

5562
05:46:58,040 --> 05:46:58,600
You can't be.

5563
05:46:58,720 --> 05:46:58,920
Hello?

5564
05:47:00,300 --> 05:47:00,740
Americans.

5565
05:47:02,800 --> 05:47:03,680
I'm Canadian.

5566
05:47:04,440 --> 05:47:05,020
Trump, you're not gonna lie.

5567
05:47:05,240 --> 05:47:08,680
During the VOD review, I was in bed when my VOD review was
in bed.

5568
05:47:09,320 --> 05:47:12,680
Bro, Jesse was like, dog, you gotta do this.

5569
05:47:12,980 --> 05:47:14,020
Dog, you gotta do that.

5570
05:47:14,360 --> 05:47:15,540
Do we go top?

5571
05:47:15,660 --> 05:47:16,500
Do we go top or no?

5572
05:47:16,780 --> 05:47:17,520
I was like.

5573
05:47:17,700 --> 05:47:17,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5574
05:47:18,140 --> 05:47:18,580
I was like.

5575
05:47:18,700 --> 05:47:19,340
That was a lot.

5576
05:47:19,380 --> 05:47:20,340
I'm not surprised.

5577
05:47:20,480 --> 05:47:21,880
But I just had to get a couple feet.

5578
05:47:23,140 --> 05:47:24,340
Did you process anything?

5579
05:47:24,820 --> 05:47:26,120
I processed everything.

5580
05:47:26,440 --> 05:47:27,160
I'm not kidding.

5581
05:47:27,260 --> 05:47:27,900
It's okay.

5582
05:47:28,220 --> 05:47:28,860
Where are they?

5583
05:47:29,280 --> 05:47:29,920
They're main.

5584
05:47:30,160 --> 05:47:30,520
With hella no.

5585
05:47:30,720 --> 05:47:32,020
Or hella Punisher, Moon Knight.

5586
05:47:32,160 --> 05:47:33,040
Triple, shoot him out.

5587
05:47:33,120 --> 05:47:34,660
Shoot him out.

5588
05:47:35,020 --> 05:47:36,060
Shoot him out.

5589
05:47:36,180 --> 05:47:36,820
Shoot him out.

5590
05:47:37,320 --> 05:47:38,840
You should take infinite damage.

5591
05:47:39,920 --> 05:47:40,340
I slept now.

5592
05:47:41,460 --> 05:47:41,640
Nice.

5593
05:47:43,360 --> 05:47:43,680
Nice.

5594
05:47:44,520 --> 05:47:45,000
Nice.

5595
05:47:45,380 --> 05:47:45,720
Nice.

5596
05:47:45,720 --> 05:47:45,760
Nice.

5597
05:47:45,760 --> 05:47:46,260
I'm boosted you.

5598
05:47:47,560 --> 05:47:48,040
Nice.

5599
05:47:48,340 --> 05:47:48,680
Nice.

5600
05:47:48,700 --> 05:47:51,060
So do you want me to stand in front of you or behind you?

5601
05:47:51,940 --> 05:47:52,940
No, you should be from.

5602
05:47:53,100 --> 05:47:53,320
Okay.

5603
05:47:53,560 --> 05:47:54,960
You can be pretty close to some of this.

5604
05:47:55,040 --> 05:47:55,240
Okay.

5605
05:47:56,880 --> 05:47:58,540
I'm doing a lot of useful damage.

5606
05:47:59,620 --> 05:48:02,000
You kind of want to heal it at the same time.

5607
05:48:02,420 --> 05:48:03,080
Similar with Jeff.

5608
05:48:03,760 --> 05:48:04,560
I don't have one right off.

5609
05:48:05,280 --> 05:48:05,820
Just raid.

5610
05:48:07,500 --> 05:48:11,300
If they go top, can we match top?

5611
05:48:11,460 --> 05:48:11,680
Can we match top?

5612
05:48:11,680 --> 05:48:12,100
Yeah, yeah.

5613
05:48:12,200 --> 05:48:13,460
I can't, if you all, I'm here.

5614
05:48:13,600 --> 05:48:14,020
Wait, there's...

5615
05:48:14,460 --> 05:48:15,360
Just shoot the strange.

5616
05:48:15,980 --> 05:48:16,440
Just shoot the strange.

5617
05:48:16,680 --> 05:48:17,000
I got it.

5618
05:48:17,000 --> 05:48:17,960
I got the one point.

5619
05:48:18,740 --> 05:48:20,340
I slapped, I slapped them.

5620
05:48:20,860 --> 05:48:22,060
Oh my god, where is he?

5621
05:48:22,680 --> 05:48:23,520
I quit match.

5622
05:48:23,940 --> 05:48:24,900
You can just die now.

5623
05:48:25,460 --> 05:48:26,300
Boon Knights main!

5624
05:48:26,740 --> 05:48:27,780
I'm fine, I'm fine.

5625
05:48:28,100 --> 05:48:28,920
I couldn't do anything.

5626
05:48:29,180 --> 05:48:29,880
He's one though.

5627
05:48:30,560 --> 05:48:31,280
I kind of trod.

5628
05:48:32,320 --> 05:48:33,500
You can win, you can win, you can win.

5629
05:48:35,420 --> 05:48:36,160
Heap duck, heap, heap.

5630
05:48:36,660 --> 05:48:36,980
Lift,

5631
05:48:40,120 --> 05:48:41,220
lift, lift, just focus on living.

5632
05:48:42,400 --> 05:48:43,280
We're all coming back.

5633
05:48:43,420 --> 05:48:44,740
Yeah, just live, just live.

5634
05:48:45,060 --> 05:48:46,180
Alright, Mantis is coming back.

5635
05:48:46,460 --> 05:48:47,000
I'm 1 HP.

5636
05:48:47,060 --> 05:48:47,760
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.

5637
05:48:47,900 --> 05:48:48,400
I have you.

5638
05:48:48,700 --> 05:48:49,700
I have care for you, I have care for you.

5639
05:48:50,400 --> 05:48:50,860
We help you.

5640
05:48:50,920 --> 05:48:51,060
We help you.

5641
05:48:51,060 --> 05:48:52,420
I'm gonna die.

5642
05:48:52,480 --> 05:48:54,160
I'm here, I'm here.

5643
05:48:54,440 --> 05:48:55,340
Kill the globe, kill it through.

5644
05:48:55,420 --> 05:48:56,780
Three, two, one.

5645
05:48:57,220 --> 05:48:57,560
No, we can.

5646
05:48:57,700 --> 05:48:58,560

5649
05:49:00,620 --> 05:49:01,600
I don't have it yet.

5650
05:49:01,640 --> 05:49:01,960
Hold up.

5651
05:49:02,160 --> 05:49:02,320
Ready?

5652
05:49:02,560 --> 05:49:03,780

No, I want the kill.

5660
05:49:11,860 --> 05:49:13,140
Don't kill him, don't kill him, don't kill him.

5661
05:49:14,580 --> 05:49:17,020
I killed him with the hook.

5662
05:49:17,540 --> 05:49:17,820
Yeah.

5663
05:49:19,620 --> 05:49:20,700
They're on Spider-Man now.

5664
05:49:20,740 --> 05:49:21,500
They're on Strange.

5665
05:49:21,680 --> 05:49:22,540
Do you think they're TPing?

5666
05:49:22,940 --> 05:49:24,860
I'm gonna try to spawn camp the Moon Knight.

5667
05:49:27,180 --> 05:49:28,380
They're not TPing now.

5668
05:49:28,660 --> 05:49:28,920
Okay.

5669
05:49:29,700 --> 05:49:30,480
You can push into them.

5670
05:49:30,680 --> 05:49:30,940
They use Strange.

5671
05:49:31,920 --> 05:49:33,260

5672
05:49:33,340 --> 05:49:33,860

5673
05:49:33,920 --> 05:49:34,360
Truth is Strange.

5674
05:49:34,560 --> 05:49:35,760
The Strange is trolling.

5675
05:49:35,960 --> 05:49:37,000

5676
05:49:37,060 --> 05:49:37,480

05:49:50,960 --> 05:49:52,060
He's not gonna boot me off now.

5690
05:49:52,060 --> 05:49:55,500
Shoot the Spider-Man, shoot the Spider-Man guys.

5691
05:49:55,540 --> 05:49:56,760
You can't do it.

5692
05:49:56,900 --> 05:49:57,920
Oh, they pointed the point out.

5693
05:49:58,720 --> 05:50:00,420

5696
05:50:03,600 --> 05:50:04,260

5697
05:50:04,600 --> 05:50:05,600
No, no, no, no, no.

5698
05:50:05,720 --> 05:50:05,880

5702
05:50:10,480 --> 05:50:11,600
I'm touching points still.

5703
05:50:12,680 --> 05:50:13,020
I need care.

5704
05:50:13,060 --> 05:50:13,300
I need care.

5705
05:50:13,420 --> 05:50:13,880
I don't want to die.

5706
05:50:15,560 --> 05:50:16,320
Oh, I'm dying.

5707
05:50:16,480 --> 05:50:16,620

5708
05:50:16,760 --> 05:50:16,860

5709
05:50:17,020 --> 05:50:17,220
I'm fine.

5710
05:50:17,620 --> 05:50:18,020
We can win.

5711
05:50:18,120 --> 05:50:18,340
We can win.

5712
05:50:18,700 --> 05:50:19,880
If I walk up deep, I can ult them here.

5713
05:50:19,940 --> 05:50:20,620
I have set up.

5714
05:50:21,100 --> 05:50:21,960
We're on Spider-Man, careful.

5715
05:50:22,140 --> 05:50:23,800
They're gonna have Spider-Man in Strange soon.

5716
05:50:24,460 --> 05:50:25,280
I can ult them.

5717
05:50:25,340 --> 05:50:25,800

Do you want me to ult you here?

5720

Oh, and I'm off the max.

5730
05:50:38,700 --> 05:50:38,980

5731
05:50:39,100 --> 05:50:39,260
Oh.

5732
05:50:40,980 --> 05:50:41,680
That's my word.

5733
05:50:42,340 --> 05:50:42,920
We need to move up.

5734
05:50:42,920 --> 05:50:43,360
We can walk here.

5735
05:50:43,420 --> 05:50:44,100
Play left side.

5736
05:50:44,240 --> 05:50:44,560
Play left side.

5737
05:50:44,820 --> 05:50:45,520

5739
05:50:45,840 --> 05:50:46,320
Come back.

5740
05:50:46,320 --> 05:50:46,700
Get out.

5741
05:50:47,200 --> 05:50:47,540
Skip space.

5742
05:50:47,720 --> 05:50:47,980
Skip space.

5743
05:50:50,040 --> 05:50:50,820

Okay.

5746
05:50:52,420 --> 05:50:53,120
They're gonna have Spider-Man.

5747
05:50:53,180 --> 05:50:53,880
Here we go, top left.

5748
05:50:54,120 --> 05:50:54,680
Can we go top left?

5749
05:50:54,740 --> 05:50:58,680
Can we go top left and go deep in the soul to practice it?

5750
05:50:58,980 --> 05:50:59,200
Yeah.

5751
05:50:59,440 --> 05:51:00,240

I can go with Bucky.

5754
05:51:02,560 --> 05:51:03,080
They're gonna have a Spider-Man, by the way.

5755
05:51:03,080 --> 05:51:04,060
I'm just gonna copy in.

5756
05:51:04,180 --> 05:51:04,960

Yeah, yeah.

5771
05:51:27,980 --> 05:51:29,560

That is good.

5963
06:01:11,500 --> 06:01:18,380
score is three i feel like that wasn't coordinated though
yeah that was not coordinated because we didn't hide we get

5964
06:01:18,380 --> 06:01:28,200
poked out before that was my bad yeah we need to hide wait
and also he deserves to be passenger princess he's probably

5965
06:01:28,200 --> 06:01:35,460
against close you always bait engage snake case you bait
engage because you wait bait dome right against emma it's

5966
06:01:35,460 --> 06:01:42,180
the same too you go in you go instantly out to bait dome and
bait diamond so it's very good you know because then the

5967
06:01:42,180 --> 06:01:48,640
debate on the uh healing bubble right yeah yeah the healing
bubble the dome yeah right because then she doesn't have

5968
06:01:48,640 --> 06:01:54,320
that to defend herself she's she's very squishy and she
instantly has to just like try for healing you know

5969
06:01:57,760 --> 06:02:07,820
wait don't you don't want to practice yeah my bunny hop yeah
oh i thought we were running dive that's why yeah That's

5970
06:02:07,820 --> 06:02:08,220
cool.

5971
06:02:08,220 --> 06:02:09,200
30 seconds before you attract.

5972
06:02:09,680 --> 06:02:09,840
Yeah, right.

5973
06:02:09,980 --> 06:02:10,480
Very good.

5974
06:02:11,020 --> 06:02:12,640
Like, I like, like hard.

5975
06:02:12,840 --> 06:02:14,300
Is the Injus jump the same?

5976
06:02:14,340 --> 06:02:15,360
I thought they were on triple DPS.

5977
06:02:15,580 --> 06:02:19,420
It's just, you just, yeah, it's like, you just bind the,
bind scroll wheel.

5978
06:02:19,880 --> 06:02:20,300
It's the usual.

5979
06:02:20,400 --> 06:02:21,400
It's like apex bunny hop.

5980
06:02:21,960 --> 06:02:23,800
I want to see if the jump is the same.

5981
06:02:24,720 --> 06:02:28,020
Trust me, you don't, you know about like mine, like, three,
two, like for all the way.

5982
06:02:28,940 --> 06:02:29,520
Two, one.

5983
06:02:30,320 --> 06:02:33,120
I think it's the same mechanic.

5984
06:02:33,580 --> 06:02:33,920
I think it's the same.

5985
06:02:33,920 --> 06:02:34,360
I think it's the same.

5986
06:02:34,600 --> 06:02:35,840
Three, two, one.

5987
06:02:35,840 --> 06:02:36,320
What did you say?

5988
06:02:36,320 --> 06:02:37,360
Oh, they're lazy.

5989
06:02:37,560 --> 06:02:38,320
They reused it.

5990
06:02:39,980 --> 06:02:40,840
They're lazy.

5991
06:02:42,700 --> 06:02:46,740
I think if any develops are lazy, then...

5992
06:02:46,740 --> 06:02:48,000
No, I'm kidding.

5993
06:02:48,120 --> 06:02:48,440
I'm kidding.

5994
06:02:49,020 --> 06:02:49,900
They are very effective.

5995
06:02:50,920 --> 06:02:51,500
Yeah, they do.

5996
06:02:53,260 --> 06:02:53,860
It's okay.

5997
06:02:54,020 --> 06:02:56,220
I could go, Snake, if you want to go early.

5998
06:02:56,840 --> 06:02:58,720
Three, two, one.

5999
06:02:59,920 --> 06:03:00,160

06:06:10,540 --> 06:06:11,680

Yeah, our chemistry is getting better.

6090
06:07:05,680 --> 06:07:09,940
It's not like two coaching sessions we do a lot, you know,
but like they do something for sure.

6091
06:07:10,160 --> 06:07:11,300
They help me a lot actually.

and nervous because I feel like I wasn't doing so well and I

6128
06:09:10,390 --> 06:09:12,510
felt like I was shutting my team down.

But I felt like I was getting, yeah, I'm getting improving.

6130

6132
06:09:21,570 --> 06:09:28,010

was like, I was letting Crook down as the support duo.

6133
06:09:28,490 --> 06:09:31,950
But during the VOD review, I wasn't the issue.

6171
06:14:27,990 --> 06:14:39,050
like i got more confident as a player as we uh as we went on
it is a very straight i mean like the matches um you know uh

6172
06:14:39,050 --> 06:14:46,990
the matches itself was uh was like you know it was just a
second match but tomorrow's gonna be even more difficult i

6173
06:14:46,990 --> 06:14:51,210
don't know if i should stream on twitch guys Do I stream it
on Twitch or YouTube for tomorrow?

6174
06:14:51,350 --> 06:14:52,830
Do you guys want to watch it on Twitch or YouTube?

6175
06:14:53,310 --> 06:14:54,390
I just can't multi-stream.

6176
06:14:55,210 --> 06:14:56,710
I can't multi-stream it.

6177
06:14:56,810 --> 06:14:58,250
Chat, that's the only problem.

6178
06:14:59,810 --> 06:15:02,770
Because if I multi-stream, I get like half the frames.

6179
06:15:05,290 --> 06:15:05,410
YouTube?

6180
06:15:05,710 --> 06:15:07,210
Okay, YouTube for consistency.

06:15:08,130 --> 06:15:09,310
I will do YouTube.

6182
06:15:09,610 --> 06:15:11,210
I see more YouTube than Twitch.

6183
06:15:12,630 --> 06:15:16,750
All right, we'll do YouTube then for part two, day two.

6184
06:15:16,830 --> 06:15:17,910
I don't know if we have day three.

6185
06:15:17,910 --> 06:15:18,510
It's day three.

6186
06:15:18,790 --> 06:15:26,590
Twitch because if we don't make it I'll stream on Twitch
