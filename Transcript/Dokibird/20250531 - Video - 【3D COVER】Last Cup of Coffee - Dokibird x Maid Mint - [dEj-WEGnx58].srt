00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,060
Someday, we'll have our last conversation And drink our last cup of coffee.

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:22,220
Someday, we might be eighty And think about the different things we used to say.

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:29,300
All the memories of you will just become a ghost of a smile Caught in the wind.

4
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,640
Someday, it'll be the last day.

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:06,280
Someday, it could be over The moon could seem so far away Despite... All the adventures that we promised We'd go on... Again...

6
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:21,960
Then and again... All the memories of you and all the stories We were a part of... Lost in the wind... Someday... Someday... It'll be the last day...

7
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:51,860
I won't forget how it feels to be loved To be remembered by someone as special as you Someday... I will... Drink the last cup of coffee... With a smile...

8
00:01:51,860 --> 00:02:21,840
... path thatstreamed...

9
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,260
I won't forget how it feels to be loved.

10
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,760
To be remembered by someone as special as you.

11
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,420
Someday, I will drink the last cup of coffee with a smile.
