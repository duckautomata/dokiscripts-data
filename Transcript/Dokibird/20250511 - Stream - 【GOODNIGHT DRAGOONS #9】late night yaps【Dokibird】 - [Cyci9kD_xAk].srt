00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,440
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,120
Oh, wait.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,480
Let me get chat in here.

4
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,340
Don't worry.

5
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,980
I decided to keep my repentance super chat here.

6
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,240
In case anyone wants to repent.

7
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,000
Since the new pope got elected or voted in.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,540
Is that what it's called?

9
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,420
The new pope got voted in.

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,740
If you have any sins you would like me to forgive, it's right here.

11
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,120
But it's been a while.

12
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,820
It's been a while since we did a good night.

13
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,460
Oh, wait.

14
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,060
I want to... Okay, we're doing this live.

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,360
I actually, like, lay down in bed.

16
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,420
I lay down in bed in between streams.

17
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,360
I want to add something real quick.

18
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,160
Let me see.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,340
Let me see.

20
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
It's all live.

21
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,180
Okay.

22
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,120
Let me see if I can find one.

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:37,980
Wait.

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,340
Okay.

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,000
Uh... What are they called?

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,900
Oh, that's what they're called.

27
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,240
Okay.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,020
I know you guys are like, what is she doing right now?

29
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,300
Look, guys, you'll understand.

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,660
You'll understand when I find a PNG of...

31
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,380
Oh, wait.

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,380
That's so cute.

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,420
Okay, guys.

34
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,060
You'll understand when I find a PNG of it, guys.

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
You're gonna understand.

36
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,860
No, I have to log in.

37
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,220
Okay, never mind.

38
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,620
Okay.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,620
I'm gonna steal this.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,560
All right.

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,460
You're gonna under...

43
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,640
No, Toki.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,500
Don't steal it.

45
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm gonna...

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm gonna snap.

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
You won't illegally download a card, would you?

48
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,740
That taught me everything I know because that was already illegal.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,880
Oh, man.

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,940
I thank you for the super chat.

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,200
Thank you.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,920
Thank you.

53
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,180
I know a lot of you are really confused with what I'm doing right now.

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,860
But don't worry.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm pulling up Photoshop.

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,420
It's another Photoshop adventure right now.

57
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,780
Can I send my repentance in advance?

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,660
Thank you, the super chat.

59
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,360
Thank you.

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:51,760
Thank you.

61
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
What do you mean by that?

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,420
What are you gonna do later?

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,700
I'm doing something really silly.

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,700
I think it'd be really cute, though.

65
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:04,680
All right.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,480
Let's see.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,300
I'm doing something silly.

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,740
But, like, I think it'd be really cute if I...

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,620
If I Photoshop this correctly.

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,920
Oh, my God.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,200
That stupid flower song is stuck in my goddamn head right now.

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,080
You can be my flower.

73
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,620
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Ba-ba-da-da-da.

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,520
That stupid fucking song is stuck in my head.

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,380
Because of the YouTube shorts algorithm.

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,960
I'm gonna disappear for a little bit, guys.

78
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,700
Don't worry.

79
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,020
I'm still in your hearts.

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Or I'm still living rent-free in your head.

81
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,320
Do not worry.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Let me do something silly real quick.

83
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm doing it all live!

84
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,820
Yippee!

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,180
Don't worry, you're hearing my voice, so...

86
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,820
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na.

87
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,060
Na na na na na na na na.

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,900
Wait, why is it not...

89
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,640
No, that's not how I want it to work.

90
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,080
Sorry, I'm like...

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,680
K...

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
There you go.

93
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,360
All right, that works.

94
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,440
Wait, I can make it better.

95
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,940
Come on.

96
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,420
Come on.

97
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,780
Stick it in.

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,480
Okay, there you go.

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,640
Yay!

100
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,860
It worked!

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,940
Oh, that's cute.

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,380
Okay.

103
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,000
Wait, does it work?

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Does this work?

105
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,260
Okay, wait.

106
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,650
Looks weird.

107
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,470
Wait, give me a sec.

108
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,050
I thought it'd be a cute idea.

109
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,770
Okay, it sort of works.

110
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,250
All right.

111
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,250
I thought it was cute.

112
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,150
I thought it'd be cute.

113
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,450
Oh, Coyote, thank you for the super chat.

114
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,490
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,170
Doki, I must confess something.

116
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,590
Whenever you're Doki, I miss your feathers.

117
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,850
Thank you for the super chat.

118
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,970
Thank you, thank you.

119
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,690
Next is thank you for the super chat.

120
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,970
Thank you, thank you.

121
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:30,750
All right, guys.

122
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,090
Now you can repent now.

123
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,350
This is the perfect time to start repenting.

124
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,290
This is...

125
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,150
You silly dragoons.

126
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,050
This is the reason why it's here.

127
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,330
It's time to repent.

128
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,330
Okay.

129
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,450
All right.

130
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,130
Look!

131
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,330
Yay!

132
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,090
See, it's like, it's like, you know, good night dragoons.

133
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,790
You know, I have a little, you know, a little good sleeping cap on.

134
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,490
Look at that!

135
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,530
I have a little sleeping cap on, guys.

136
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,390
I think maybe I should fix it.

137
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,050
Okay, wait.

138
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,270
Actually, give me a sec.

139
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:15,510
Maybe?

140
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,810
I don't know if I should put it in the back or should it be in the front a little bit.

141
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,050
Uh, Mr. Stan, thank you for the super chat.

142
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,990
Thank you, thank you.

143
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,850
I like to repent my sins.

144
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,330
As in the past two weeks, I think more about my new favorite game than my Oshidoki bird.

145
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,630
May I be forgiven?

146
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,290
No!

147
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,690
Unless you...

148
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,890
Unless you bribe me more.

149
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,530
I'm joking.

150
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,730
Mr. Stan, thank you for the super chat.

151
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,010
Thank you, thank you.

152
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,910
Um, Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

153
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,030
Thank you, thank you.

154
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,510
I like to repent my sins.

155
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,430
Uh, Forgizmas for trolling the waiting room with hallucinated loops.

156
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,110
Thank you for the super chat.

157
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,230
Thank you, thank you.

158
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,850
Ultra noob, thank you for the super chat.

159
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,830
Thank you, thank you.

160
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,970
Forgive me, Doki.

161
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,230
Okay, uh...

162
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,830
I'm not reading it out.

163
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,770
Thank you for the super chat.

164
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,530
Thank you, thank you.

165
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,650
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,450
Thank you, thank you.

167
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,210
Hello, Doki.

168
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,710
I like to repent for the impure thoughts I heard earlier.

169
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,730
You said some wild things.

170
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,190
Thank you, the super chat.

171
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:18,990
Thank you, thank you.

172
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,190
That is why we have Goodnight Dragoons right after the Mario Mon stream.

173
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,270
That is exactly why.

174
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,950
Wow!

175
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,550
That was a good timing for you because I am feeling pretty EP today.

176
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,230
So I'm definitely gonna rest up.

177
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,290
I'm gonna rest up right after this stream.

178
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,610
Today's not gonna be a super long...

179
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,570
I mean, usually Goodnight Dragoons are not that long type of streams.

180
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,010
But today, I'm gonna make it...

181
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,670
How long are they usually are?

182
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,170
They're usually like an hour to two hours long.

183
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,310
I'm gonna speak a little softer today.

184
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,710
Because I don't wanna...

185
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,250
I don't wanna...

186
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,610
You know...

187
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,690
I don't wanna use too much of my...

188
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,850
I don't wanna be too overzealous today.

189
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,390
And too loud.

190
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,470
Cause I wanna rest up my voice.

191
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,530
I wanna take care of it a little bit more today.

192
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,250
So I'm gonna be talking a little more softer.

193
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,590
Um...

194
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,270
Just cause, you know, my voice is...

195
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,410
I'm pretty fucked right now.

196
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,530
My voice is pretty fucked up right now.

197
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,510
So...

198
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm gonna be talking a little bit more softer today.

199
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,610
Cause it is...

200
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,970
CCC, goodnight time!

201
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,950
Wow!

202
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,790
Um...

203
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,890
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

204
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,870
Thank you, thank you.

205
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,010
Uh...

206
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,950
Pardon the question, but did you ever get the desktop confessional working?

207
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,590
Um...

208
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,550
Um...

209
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,550
I haven't been able to go visit my local London Drugs recently.

210
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,890
Because, you know, with everything going on.

211
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,430
But whenever...

212
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,470
Whenever I'm able to, I'm definitely gonna...

213
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,210
Um...

214
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,510
The first thing I'm gonna buy is a desktop confessional.

215
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,450
So don't worry.

216
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,430
Um...

217
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,010
I sadly have not been able to go visit, uh, one lately to buy another desktop.

218
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,610
Cause I want, you know...

219
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,950
I wish I could use it whenever randomly on my stream.

220
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,350
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

221
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,150
Um...

222
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,630
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat.

223
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,630
Thank you, thank you.

224
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,310
I have nothing to repent for my curses are fair and just for the drag goons.

225
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,690
Thank you for the super chat.

226
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,470
Thank you, thank you.

227
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,490
Your curses only made me stronger.

228
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,850
I ended up...

229
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,730
I just kept playing the game.

230
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:38,970
I...

231
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,190
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

232
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,210
You make me lose more?

233
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,670
I play more.

234
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,110
Ha ha ha ha ha!

235
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,110
It only makes me stronger.

236
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,270
It makes me wanna play more.

237
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,590
To get back the lost RP I gained.

238
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,010
Ha ha ha ha!

239
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,210
It has failed.

240
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,070
Ha ha ha ha ha!

241
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,510
Ha ha ha ha!

242
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,810
Ha ha ha ha!

243
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,870
If your curses didn't work...

244
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,730
If your curse...

245
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,090
I mean...

246
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,550
If...

247
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,950
If you didn't curse me...

248
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,090
I could have ended it sooner.

249
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,710
Because I would have been like...

250
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,550
Oh, I got...

251
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,270
I got...

252
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,870
Celestia too!

253
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,850
On YouTube!

254
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,230
Guess I'll stop streaming!

255
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,230
For the day!

256
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,210
But instead...

257
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,830
Because I didn't win...

258
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,170
I...

259
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,770
You made me move to Twitch!

260
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,770
So I kept playing!

261
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,430
Ha ha ha ha!

262
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,870
It was your fault!

263
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,770
Ha ha ha ha ha!

264
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,890
Ha ha ha ha!

265
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,290
Ha ha ha!

266
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,590
Ha ha ha!

267
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,430
Um...

268
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,050
Emlinks!

269
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,230
Thank you for the Super Chat!

270
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,250
Thank you thank you!

271
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,470
I repent not being...

272
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,410
Responsible for the money!

273
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,530
Too real!

274
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,330
Capable!

275
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,110
Thank you for the Akasupa!

276
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,650
Thank you thank you!

277
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,890
From my Laker!

278
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,110
Aw, thank you!

279
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,710
I really appreciate the support.

280
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,890
And you coming out of lyric mode to support me.

281
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,290
I really appreciate that.

282
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,290
Thank you again for the Akasupa.

283
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,890
Thank you.

284
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,630
Thank you.

285
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,390
Fistful.

286
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,590
Thank you for the super chat.

287
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:01,910
Thank you.

288
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,490
Thank you.

289
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,890
I miss repent because I can't make it for most of Goodnight Dragons today.

290
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,390
Thanks for the fun streams this week.

291
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,530
Of course, no problem.

292
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,250
I really appreciate it.

293
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:19,610
Um, yeah, I'm definitely gonna rest up tonight because I am feeling... I am feeling eepy at the moment.

294
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:28,070
And that's why I feel like a soft, dokey, soft, dokey time because I am feeling eepy and tired.

295
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,910
But I did promise you guys I'd be here.

296
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,710
They wish you a good night so you guys can finally sleep.

297
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,110
I mean, the last time you slept was three weeks ago.

298
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,970
Um, last time I told you guys good night was when I allowed you to sleep.

299
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,410
So, um, that's why I'm here today.

300
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,290
Ozzy, thank you for the magenta soup.

301
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,190
Ah, thank you.

302
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,810
Thank you.

303
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,370
It's my birthday tomorrow.

304
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,650
So, I guess this... it's a good time to repent for all my sins this year.

305
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,270
Oh!

306
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,510
I'll give you a happy, um, future birthday to you.

307
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,350
Just because usually I don't stream on Sunday.

308
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,190
Um, happy future birthday to you.

309
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,890
Happy birthday to you.

310
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,950
Happy birthday, dear Ozzy.

311
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,550
Happy birthday to you.

312
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,030
Yeah!

313
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,050
I hope you have a great birthday tomorrow.

314
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,250
Thank you, thank you.

315
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,270
Uh, over.

316
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,710
Thank... welcome to the tomato farm.

317
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,630
Welcome, welcome.

318
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,170
I really appreciate it.

319
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,050
What time is it?

320
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,850
It's like...

321
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,210
9.35.

322
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,950
But like, you know...

323
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,410
Like I told you guys earlier, I've been, like, incredibly...

324
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,450
My energy is, like, extra low today.

325
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,890
Um, because, um...

326
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,710
I guess it's all been sapped out by rivals.

327
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,290
So, I'm already, like, super low energy today.

328
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,790
Uh, that's why I'm gonna head to bed super early.

329
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,530
Usually I don't sleep that early.

330
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,870
I mean, if ever.

331
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,770
Usually, usually we don't sleep this early.

332
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,570
But today's a special day.

333
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,350
Also, I realize there's no music play.

334
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,910
Um, there should be some music now.

335
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:00,990
Whoopsie.

336
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,730
It's been a while since we had Good Night, Dragoon.

337
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,330
Because I forgot about the music.

338
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,710
Wait, that's not the right music.

339
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,600
I was like...

340
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,420
Wait a minute.

341
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,860
That's not the right music.

342
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,580
That's...

343
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,880
That's the...

344
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,900
That's not...

345
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,760
Um...

346
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,140
Oh, yeah!

347
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,780
I would...

348
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,360
I forgot.

349
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,560
I would play...

350
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,440
I would play, like, lo-fi.

351
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,660
I forgot about that.

352
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,100
Sorry.

353
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,660
I just remembered what music I would play.

354
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,140
I was like, what music did I play?

355
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,000
I...

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,820
I was like...

357
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,900
It's been...

358
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,260
That's how long it's been.

359
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,660
Alright, let me grab some...

360
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,640
Let me grab some...

361
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,820
Let me grab some cute BGMs for us.

362
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,100
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

363
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,480
I always need to remember the channel I use for it.

364
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,340
I use, like, a special BGM channel for these music.

365
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,480
For the music I pick.

366
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,620
Because...

367
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,460
Because it's cute!

368
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,340
Is this?

369
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,600
No.

370
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,800
Where is it?

371
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,740
Is it this one?

372
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,940
Uh...

373
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,420
No?

374
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,400
Where the fuck is it?

375
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,980
Oh my gosh.

376
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,060
You know when you're subscribed to too many channels?

377
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,380
And you don't...

378
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,980
I always don't remember...

379
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,760
The channel name.

380
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,400
Because it's, like, in Japanese.

381
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,620
So, like...

382
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,980
And obviously I can't read Japanese.

383
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,820
So, like, it's a struggle.

384
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:31,880
Alright.

385
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,700
Relax and everyday free.

386
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,040
Okay.

387
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,580
BGM free.

388
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:39,880
Okay.

389
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,860
We'll use...

390
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,720
Oh, we'll use this one.

391
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,540
This one's cute.

392
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,460
Is it free?

393
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,500
It is.

394
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:46,940
Alright.

395
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,100
Ah!

396
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,540
Oh my god.

397
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,500
There's new music.

398
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,440
Nice.

399
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,320
Okay.

400
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,000
This is too loud.

401
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,520
Let me...

402
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,610
Okay.

403
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,150
Give me a sec.

404
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,230
It's too loud.

405
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,790
Let me...

406
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,070
Is this okay?

407
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,350
Is that...

408
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,450
Is that loud enough?

409
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,490
I don't want to be too loud, though.

410
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,010
So that you guys can still hear me.

411
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,650
Because I'm, like, not too loud today as well.

412
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,130
So...

413
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,930
Um...

414
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,390
I want to make sure that it's not too loud, too.

415
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,450
So you guys can still be able to hear me.

416
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:27,810
Uh...

417
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,130
GG!

418
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,310
Thank you for the super chat.

419
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:29,730
Thank you.

420
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,410
Thank you.

421
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,710
Alright.

422
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,410
Next.

423
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,050
I'm not...

424
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,210
Sometimes I can't read some things.

425
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,230
Ha ha ha!

426
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,930
Oh my god.

427
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,770
I can't read for some reason.

428
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:45,930
Forward.

429
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,370
Thank you for the super chat.

430
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:47,730
Thank you.

431
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,310
Thank you.

432
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,730
I must repent.

433
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,490
I've been a fool inside an NBA.

434
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,250
And now part of my soul is trapped in a box in another dimension.

435
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,690
Part of it!

436
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,310
Oh!

437
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,090
You forgot.

438
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,670
I got Disney lawyers.

439
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,890
It's not just a part of it.

440
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,490
Uh...

441
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,650
Thank you for the super chat.

442
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,030
Thank you.

443
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,850
Thank you.

444
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,530
I heard they're, like, making a new...

445
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,270
Speaking of Disney.

446
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,450
I heard they're, like, making a new...

447
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,190
Um...

448
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,730
New additions to Disneyland.

449
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,490
Or Disney World.

450
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:16,750
Whatever.

451
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,110
Okay.

452
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,250
New additions to Disneyland.

453
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:20,490
Disneyland.

454
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,510
I heard about it.

455
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,130
What's new?

456
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,790
What land was it?

457
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,910
What's new at Disneyland?

458
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,590
Mickey Town Reimagining.

459
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,930
Lightning Names.

460
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,050
Oh!

461
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,010
Was it...

462
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,010
Francisco Square?

463
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,230
The Star Wars...

464
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,590
Okay.

465
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,790
That can't be right.

466
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,750
What are the new stuff they're adding?

467
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,670
Because, like...

468
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,270
They saw how good...

469
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,170
Um...

470
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,490
The new Universal Studios were gonna be.

471
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,250
So, they decided to add, like...

472
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,710
They were gonna add, like...

473
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,090
They recently announced new additions to the Disneyland attractions.

474
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:05,370
Because they got really jealous at, like, the opening of the new Universal Studios Park.

475
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,930
And, I mean, like...

476
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,770
I mean...

477
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,390
It's actually so impressive.

478
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:12,770
Um...

479
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,830
The universe...

480
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,490
The new...

481
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,070
Uh...

482
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,010
The new theme...

483
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,170
Themed lands in Universal.

484
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,130
Was it...

485
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,750
What is it called?

486
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,490
The...

487
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,350
Epic Universe?

488
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:20,690
Yeah.

489
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,530
Epic Universe.

490
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,190
God, I really wanna go to Epic Universe.

491
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,950
But the lines are fucking terrible now.

492
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:26,730
I would...

493
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,350
If I...

494
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,410
Um...

495
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,270
I would've...

496
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,890
Oh, man.

497
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,950
Honestly, if I knew about the Epic Universe stuff...

498
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,750
I would've paid so much...

499
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,630
To get the preview tickets...

500
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,090
I honestly would've...

501
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,950
Because I feel like...

502
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,790
Those were the only times...

503
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,170
To experience it...

504
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,510
Without the...

505
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,010
The stupid fucking...

506
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,810
Like...

507
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,190
Five hour queues.

508
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,750
Like...

509
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,990
I...

510
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,010
I can't...

511
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:49,390
Like...

512
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:49,790
Like...

513
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,790
I am not...

514
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,110
Like...

515
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,630
I don't know.

516
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,510
I think it's...

517
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,210
I think...

518
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,470
It's honestly too much...

519
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,450
To wait...

520
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,330
Three plus hours...

521
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,730
For one...

522
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,830
Five minute ride.

523
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:01,970
Like...

524
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,730
That's...

525
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,650
Even if like...

526
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,750
Even if like...

527
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,970
The queue system...

528
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,570
Is like...

529
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,050
Impressive...

530
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,810
And like...

531
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,010
You know...

532
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,890
They built like the...

533
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,850
Waiting queue room...

534
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,830
Or whatever the fuck...

535
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,150
Like...

536
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,770
It's called...

537
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,590
Like the...

538
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,890
You know...

539
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,130
The...

540
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,530
The queue up system...

541
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,310
And stuff...

542
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,230
Um...

543
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,930
And it's like...

544
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,190
It's just not worth it...

545
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,810
It's not fucking worth it...

546
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,610
To like...

547
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,690
Go through...

548
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,890
All of that...

549
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,850
Just to do a five minute ride...

550
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,970
And then you have to stand there too...

551
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,730
Like you have to stand and walk there...

552
00:19:34,770 --> 00:20:00,210
I feel like getting the preview tickets is the best opportunity and you get to enjoy the queue-up system without the huge crowds pushing into you and bumping into you and crowding you up because I feel like when I saw some of the lines for it and everything,

553
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:14,350
like the queue-up system and stuff for it, I was like, oh my god, this looks beautiful at the Epic Universe, but it's just not gonna look the same when you're actually there, when it finally opens.

554
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:35,110
And I read testimonials of like, because the Epic Universe is open right now and people were saying that one of the rides, the ride's queue system was made to handle like, five-plus-hour lines.

555
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,430
That was how big the queue system was.

556
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,830
And it went to there.

557
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,270
Like, obviously, because it was like the grand opening.

558
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:48,450
So like, one of the rides was meant to have a five-hour queue system.

559
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:56,710
And like, I saw like, pictures of everyone lining up and it was just everybody like, bunched up together and I was like, oh my god.

560
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,470
That shit looks terrible.

561
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,870
That, that, that does not look fun at all.

562
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,710
And it's a five-minute ride, too.

563
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:20,210
I was like, bro, I, I can use, I can spend my time doing something else.

564
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:29,130
And like, um, I don't, it's like, I saw someone was like, oh, you could just do the VIP, uh, the VIP tour or whatever.

565
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:37,130
But like, I feel like, aren't like, VIP tours, you're taken to a different section?

566
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:45,850
And I feel like when you're taken to a different section, it's like, you miss out on what they built in the regular queue system.

567
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,130
Isn't that what, it's just, like, don't you just miss out on that?

568
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,810
Because you, you fast travel.

569
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,350
So like, I don't think that's worth it either.

570
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:03,010
Because you're just missing out on like, the actual thing they built while you're like, walking to the ride.

571
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:12,910
So, but, I, like, cause like, they usually like, have like, little cool easter eggs or like, um, uh, yeah, you can miss out stuff.

572
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:29,230
Cause like, that's why people build like, uh, that's why like, amusement parks build like, little easter eggs and, um, and, uh, little easter eggs and little like, uh, uh, nods to like, the game or the movie or whatever they're basing it off on.

573
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,790
And there's like, a lot of really cool things and all that.

574
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:37,370
But when you do like, the VIP tours or like, you know, Lightning Lane or whatever, you miss out on all of that.

575
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:43,410
And it's just like, you're paying more to see less of the cool things that, um, that you could see.

576
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,130
Um, and I just think that's like, I don't know.

577
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,530
I just don't think it's worth it.

578
00:22:49,930 --> 00:23:01,850
Um, just cause like, just cause like, you know, part of the, um, because like, uh, they built such a cool, cool, like, queue thing.

579
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,030
It's just for you to, you know, look at it while you're waiting in line.

580
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,350
Um, the VIPs can see behind the scenes stuff.

581
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,510
Yeah, but then it's like, I want to see like, the, uh, the queue system though.

582
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,910
And, um, the waiting.

583
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,130
Yeah.

584
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,370
So like, cause like, you know, they, they purposely did that.

585
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:24,310
So like, you know, people won't complain as much just so you're like more immersed into the world and everything.

586
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,510
Um, Disney's waiting lines have progressively gotten worse.

587
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,970
I mean, there's more people.

588
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,390
People are making more kids.

589
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,670
Actually, no, that's not true.

590
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:50,570
I heard, I read an article that, um, I read an article that, um, apparently the newer generations are making less kids because everyone's like, we can't afford children, which is true.

591
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,290
Everyone's like, kids in this economy?

592
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,290
Are you crazy?

593
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:10,550
You were definitely, I gotta pay off my student loans first before I think about a child.

594
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,930
Just gonna get a dog.

595
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,210
Or a cat.

596
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,510
Just gonna get a dog and a cat.

597
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,270
It's like, it's like, two kids.

598
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,410
I, I, I, yeah, I recently read that.

599
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,370
Like, people were like, why the fuck are we thinking about children right now?

600
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,750
I need to pay off my mortgage.

601
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,330
I'm still renting.

602
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,250
I can't even afford my hobbies, let alone a child.

603
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,890
I can barely take care of myself, let alone a, oh my god.

604
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,710
And then, like, I remember talking about this before.

605
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,710
But, I read that babies can suddenly just die.

606
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,250
And, like, that's like a fear.

607
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,350
Like, I remember reading this, like, a couple of years ago.

608
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,870
And it's like, yeah, they can just die.

609
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,070
And you don't, because they just forget to stop breathing.

610
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,730
And I, I, the, that, that's always, that's like in my mind sometimes.

611
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,910
That I'm like, why would you just forget how to breathe?

612
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,070
Like, like, I, what?

613
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:43,710
Like, like, I'm just, like, so it's like, they're so, it's like, they're so fragile.

614
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,650
You just, you just don't remember how to breathe.

615
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,010
And I gotta make sure you breathe?

616
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:58,890
Like, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta just make sure you're breathing?

617
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,130
Like, night and day?

618
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,830
Why are you so dumb?

619
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,310
Animal babies know how to breathe.

620
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,710
Why can't you breathe?

621
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,510
Like, that doesn't make sense.

622
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,970
Like, puppies won't just suddenly forget how to breathe?

623
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,090
They are just born this way.

624
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,190
Natural.

625
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,750
So, this is why, this is why.

626
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:36,770
Dude, they, we, we let all the non, we let all the non-breathing babies learn.

627
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,730
Like, we forced the non-breathing babies to breathe again.

628
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,670
And then.

629
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,050
We spooked them too much for the late games.

630
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,550
Baby animals know how to walk out of the womb.

631
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,610
Why can't you walk?

632
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,630
This is why.

633
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,990
Just let them not breathe.

634
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:03,950
Look.

635
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,330
David, thank you for the super chat.

636
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,450
Thank you, thank you.

637
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,570
Since men is a ghost, you don't have to.

638
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,490
Oh my god.

639
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,350
This is why it goes into the repentance.

640
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,810
Sam, thank you for the super chat.

641
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,630
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,150
I'm an adult and I so forgot to once in a while.

643
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,450
Oh yeah.

644
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,050
All I'm saying is that, I don't understand.

645
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:39,090
Why do we, why can animals learn how to walk right off the bat?

646
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,230
And then you babies can't even walk out of the womb.

647
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,850
Sorry, I'm like shaking my hands as though I'm shaking the baby.

648
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,170
But then I forgot, if you shake the baby, it also just dies.

649
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:51,790
So.

650
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,870
Just let you.

651
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,330
Why, I can't even shake you.

652
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,710
Because you're so fragile.

653
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,150
Don't shake the baby.

654
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,510
Don't.

655
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,350
Do not shake the baby, guys.

656
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,410
Do not shake the baby.

657
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,570
So, yeah.

658
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,970
I don't understand why we let this happen.

659
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,370
Why do, I like saw someone was like, Yeah, but like animals live.

660
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,890
Animals don't live as long.

661
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,610
Oh yeah.

662
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,190
You know, I can name several animals that can live longer than us.

663
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,570
And can still...

664
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:48,510
And can still like walk the moment they are born.

665
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,250
Like, I don't know.

666
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,890
Several species of turtles.

667
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,390
Name every animal.

668
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,310
Literally, turtles exist.

669
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,910
Or tortoises too.

670
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,170
Yeah, but what about outside of captivity?

671
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,350
Okay.

672
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,230
AJB.

673
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,750
Yeah, I'm calling out your name.

674
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,650
You wanna be a wise guy, don't ya?

675
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:26,910
Well, you can say that all humans are technically within captivity.

676
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:33,330
Why else is our life span so fucking long?

677
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,590
You know what it was like back in the medieval ages?

678
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,810
You'd be dead by 30.

679
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,510
Just like those animals out there in the wild.

680
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:51,630
Do you know how much modern medicine has prolonged our life span?

681
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:02,110
If you were born in the industrial ages in London, you'd be lucky to live past six.

682
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,230
Because you're gonna be working in that fucking factory, little boy.

683
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,370
Making the clothes.

684
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,550
And you're gonna be missing fingers.

685
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,790
Child.

686
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,490
Child labor was legal back then.

687
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,010
You know what they did back then in the industrial ages?

688
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:28,350
They kept popping out children, because they're like, don't worry, if we have more kids, they'll earn more money in the factories for us.

689
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,730
No children yearn for the mines.

690
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,070
The consequences of the industrial revolution.

691
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,890
Anyway, anyway, back to super chat reading.

692
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,090
Some random pie, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

693
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,930
Oh, I already read that.

694
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,350
Many wiener dogs are just as expensive as real children.

695
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,230
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

696
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,810
But at least they won't disappoint me.

697
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,930
And they can't fight back.

698
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,230
Technically.

699
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,690
I don't have to be disappointed, and they can't fight back.

700
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,570
And they won't go through puberty, because they're neutered.

701
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:30,450
I don't have to deal with puberty, because I've neutered my dog.

702
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:37,950
Which you should, if you want a dog, if you want a dog to not go crazy.

703
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,070
Laffy, thank you for the super chat.

704
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,190
Thank you, thank you.

705
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,370
Why are you sure?

706
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,310
Psycho, thank you for the super chat.

707
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,390
Thank you, thank you.

708
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,580
I am attracted to strong female VTubers.

709
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,540
Is this where I put my repentance here?

710
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,620
Don't worry, we don't judge or shame you.

711
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,420
You are forgiven.

712
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,940
Thank you for the super chat.

713
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,040
Thank you, thank you.

714
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,020
Game, thank you for the super chat.

715
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,960
Thank you, thank you.

716
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,920
You know, now that I think about it, humans really are ironically made for a long time.

717
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,500
Not a good time.

718
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,480
Thank you for the super chat.

719
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Thank you, thank you.

720
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,980
How did I get to this topic?

721
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,780
I was talking about fucking amusement parks.

722
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,640
How the fuck did I... Oh my god.

723
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,440
You know what's even more fucked up?

724
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:38,780
The fact that kangaroo embryos are built stronger than a fucking baby.

725
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,320
You know what a fucking kangaroo baby does?

726
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,540
When it pops out the womb?

727
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,220
It fucking crawls to the kangaroo pouch.

728
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,440
It has... Oh my god.

729
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,960
You know how tiny a kang... It's like... It's like a fucking embryo.

730
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,880
It's like a jelly bean.

731
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,400
The size of a jelly bean.

732
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,000
And it starts crawling to the pouch and like... And moving.

733
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,480
It shouldn't have any function as a kangaroo.

734
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:15,820
Um... It just crawls out of... Okay, let me show you the size.

735
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,720
I don't think any of you guys know the size of a kangaroo embryo.

736
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,720
I need a... Okay, kangaroo baby.

737
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,300
Like when it comes out of the fucking womb.

738
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,240
I don't think you guys understand.

739
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,440
I...

740
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,540
How do kangaroo babies get in the pouch?

741
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,720
I need you to understand how fucking... Okay, wait.

742
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,200
I don't know if I can show this on YouTube.

743
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,340
That's a little... That's a little gross.

744
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,760
And a picture of that is so... It's like a tiny jelly bean coming out of a hole.

745
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:56,080
Okay, I can't... I definitely cannot... No, there's like an illustration of like...

746
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,220
Exactly how small it is.

747
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,300
But even then, I know I can't show that on YouTube.

748
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,820
Dude, I'll... I'll give you guys the website.

749
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,320
And then you can see for yourself like the birth thing.

750
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,680
And how tiny it is.

751
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,540
It's like...

752
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,200
It's like an actual... Okay, jelly bean.

753
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,400
Okay, there has... Okay, let me find a more...

754

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,080
No, wait.

756
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,620
Okay, I learned this from my...

757
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,920
I learned this from like an animal facts book.

758
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,860
So like, it had... It definitely had a very...

759
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,180
Safe for work picture.

760
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,760
Climbing into a pouch.

761
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,460
Alright, let's see.

762
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,320
Alright, let's see.

763
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,760

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,500
Um...

765
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,500
Um...

766
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,340
Oh my god.

That showcases.

771
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
The size.

772
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,520
Of that fucking thing.

773
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,840
Alright, never mind.

774
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,740
I'll give you guys the website.

775
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,560
And you'll understand.

776
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,120
I'll give you guys the website.

777
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,080
Alright.

778
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,220
Okay, and then you'll...

779
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,320
You'll see what I mean.

780
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,260
When I say it looks like a jelly bean.

781
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,640
Coming out of a hole.

782
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,940
It looks like a jelly bean.

783
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,840
Coming out.

784
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,590
33 days.

785
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,870
It took...

786
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,690
It's a 33...

787
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:38,930
Why?

788
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,110
And then our babies.

789
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,270
Our babies.

790
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,630
It takes like, what?

791
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,630
Nine months?

792
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,790
And you can't do anything with...

793
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,750
You can't like...

794
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,930
The baby can't do anything.

795
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,930
It can't crawl.

796
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,270
Why can't you climb like a baby kangaroo?

797
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,130
Why can't you...

798
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,410
Why can't you climb like a baby kangaroo?

799
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,110
That baby can't make any money.

800
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,530
Alright, but yeah.

801
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,150
So, um...

802
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,510
So yeah, I'm just saying...

803
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:14,930
Like...

804
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,290
I feel like all other babies...

805
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,250
All other babies...

806
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,530
In the animal kingdom...

807
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,130
Are built different...

808
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,010
Compared to ours.

809
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:24,770
Aren't...

810
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,070
Like...

811
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,510
The babies...

812
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,570
Um...

813
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,850
The babies for the human race...

814
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,610
Are useless.

815
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,390
And we have to wait until they're...

816
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,910
They're useless until college!

817
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,490
Why are they useless until college?

818
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,210

Thank you.

822
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,510
On the bright side...

823
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,370
We don't have to have kids like female kiwis.

824
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,110
Or worse...

825
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,390
The female hyena.

826
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,850
But I know you guys wish they could be like...

827
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,590
The barnacle.

00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,710
Video called...

847
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,910

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,030
It's true.

849
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,810
Okay.

Alright.

851
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,890
That's a reason why we have...

852
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,330
It's Repentance Day.

853
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,250
There's a reason why it's Repentance Day, guys.

854

Are you okay?

862
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,630
Sarah, you wanna talk about it?

863
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,670
Are you okay, Sarah?

Oh yeah, anyway, back to like looking at... I'm gonna look at the...

868
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,070
Okay, what are the new rides coming to Disney?

869
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,030
What is this?

870
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,490
Uh...

871
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,050
First ever Coco ride.

872
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,250
Oh, that's gonna be exciting.

873
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,410
I'm looking for it.

874
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,230
I like Coco.

875
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,810
Coco... I love the music from Coco.

876
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,310
You know the song that he sings his grandma?

877
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:28,510
Oh my god, I cried so hard when I first watched Coco.

878
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,810
I remember like... Oh my god, the music.

879
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,810
I remember crying so hard.

880
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,510
Especially like Journey ending.

881
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,410
Oh, Trillton, Coco sings with his grandma.

882
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,570
Oh, I like that movie.

883
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,370
Coco was great.

884
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,610
Wait, when did Coco come out?

885
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,450
I was watched 2017.

886
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,570
That was 8 years ago.

887
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,950
Holy fuck, that was 8 years ago?

888
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,910
Oh my god.

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,550
Okay, like...

Yeah, wait, is it...

892
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,950

893
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,890
Like 6 years?

894
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,370
Yeah.

895
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,650
That's old.

00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,430
18, 19, 20, 21, 20, 23, 24...

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,890
Sorry, now I feel old.

899
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,430

Look, here are all these famous movies of our generation.

00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,010
In the last 5 years.

910
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,270
And then it's...

911
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,270
And then like...

912
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,290
It was like really hard.

00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,450
5 famous movies within the last 5 years?

915
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,010
Because I feel like...

916
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,510
Recently, there's not been a lot of movies...

917
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,430
That are like...

918
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,470
Super classics, you know?

919
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:58,770
Like...

920
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,230
Um...

921
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,830
That are like actual classics that were like...

922
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,510
Everyone has seen type deal.

923
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,050
Um...

924
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,110
And everyone just named movies that were like...

925
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,430
You know...

926
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,650
2010...

927
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,890
And um...

928
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,250
2010 or like...

929
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,030
Below and stuff.

930
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,090
Because there's a more...

931
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,690
Remember movies that everyone would like...

932
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,790
Talk about and everything.

933
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:16,870
That like...

934
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,910
It was like more so like...

935
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,350
Everyone around the world...

936
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,130
Can like...

937
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,610
Remember and stuff like that.

938
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,190
I like how someone was like...

939
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,910
Mad Max.

940
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,570
But you know like the one that was like...

941
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,650
The...

942
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:29,970
The...

943
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,810
Wait, when was that Mad Max movie?

944
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,070
Okay, do you know Mad Max Fury Road...

945
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,830
Was released in 2015, guys?

946
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,730
Or are you talking about Furiosa?

947
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,650
Because not everybody watched that.

948
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,690
Apparently Furiosa bombed.

949
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,050
Like...

950
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,410
But yeah, Mad Max Fury Road was 2015, guys.

951
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,410
And then...

952
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,430
And then like...

953
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,070
In the skit, they're like...

954
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,010
Oh, The Hangover.

955
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,930
That movie was released in 2009.

956
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,330
The Hangover was 2009.

957
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,170
Do you know...

958
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,030
It doesn't feel like a 2009 movie, doesn't it?

959
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:19,990
Like...

960
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,210
You would think about it.

961
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,510
Oh, yeah.

962
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,190
I love that.

963
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,470
The Hangover.

964
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,210
But that was...

965
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,310
10 plus years ago.

966
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,060
Stop.

967
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,880
What was it?

968
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,140
Oh, yeah.

969
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:42,880
But...

970
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,980
What was I was gonna say?

971
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,300
Oh, yeah.

972
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:44,780
But yeah.

973
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,440
Well...

974
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,180
How did I get to that topic, by the way?

975
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,280
How did I...

976
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,060
How did I get to that topic?

977
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,320
I want to talk about something else before that.

978
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,200
2009 was 16 years ago.

979
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,620
Oh, my God.

980
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,780
It says Sweet 16.

981
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,340
Oh, yeah.

982
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,540
Disney.

983
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,040
Disney, Disney, Disney, Disney.

984
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,620
I was looking up at the Disney Amusement Park.

985
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:09,940
But yeah.

986
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,420
I'm looking forward to Coco.

987
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,120
I'm looking forward to the Coco ride.

988
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:14,600
Sorry.

989
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,520
When I'm like tired and eatpy, I get more forgetful.

990
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,560
Because it's like...

991
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:19,760
I heard...

992
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,260
I got really worried.

993
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,500
Because I was like, oh, no.

994
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,740
Why am I like forgetting things?

995
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,120
Like, not forgetting things, but more so like...

996
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,380
My attention span is a lot lower right now.

997
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,660
But like, obviously, I'm eating stuff.

998
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,120
So like, my...

999
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,720
I get like a little bit more forgetful than usual.

1000
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,260
Just because like...

1001
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,840
Just because like, I am like a little more tired than usual.

1002
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,860
And obviously, I'm a little more stressed because of everything that's going on.

1003
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,400
So that's why I'm keeping like, oh, what was I talking about before?

1004
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,620
I'm like, what was I talking about?

1005
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,580
You know, wait.

1006
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,680
When was the PS5?

1007
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,380
I remember people were like, oh, man.

1008
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,920
PS5 is so new.

1009
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,400
But like, the PS5 was released like...

1010
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,700
2020.

1011
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,940
It's a four-year-old console already.

1012
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,380
Jesus Christ.

1013
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
It's a four-year-old console already?

1014
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,380
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1015
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:19,760
Thank you.

1016
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,300
Thank you.

1017
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm a little cousin go.

1018
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,800
The PS3?

1019
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
That's such an old console.

1020
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,800
My dad played it when he was a kid.

1021
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,660
And that threw me off the guard.

1022
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,100
It's not retro.

1023
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,040
PS1 is retro.

1024
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,020
PS2 kind of.

1025
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,100
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1026
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,500
Thank you.

1027
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,120
Thank you.

1028
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,020
Beep beeps.

1029
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,080
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1030
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,460
Thank you.

1031
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,040
Thank you.

1032
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,800
This is your usual Yaptopic hopping style.

1033
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,200
And we love you for it.

1034
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,820
Thank you for the Super Chat.

1035
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,340
Thank you.

1036
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,820
Thank you.

1037
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,420
And we still don't have games on it.

1038
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,380
We still don't have games on the PS5.

1039
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,660
It's four years old.

1040
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,160
It should be able to walk now.

1041
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,500
It should be able to say, Mama, Papa.

1042
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,980
But yet, we don't have games on the PS5.

1043
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,360
Wait, how many games does the PS5 have?

1044
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,740
Wait, how does it have 3,503 games?

1045
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,100
What are they?

1046
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,000
What are the 3,000 plus games?

1047
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,020
What are the 3,000 plus games?

1048
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,440
How many?

1049
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,140
They're all PS4 games.

1050
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,020
Jokey.

1051
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,520
They're all...

1052
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,060
Alright.

1053
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,440
How many exclusive games does the PS5 have?

1054
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,840
Has a substantial library of exclusive games.

1055
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,080
Alright.

1056
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,500
How many are they?

1057
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,200
48?

1058
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,520
48?

1059
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,320
Out of 40...

1060
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,860
That's like 10 games...

1061
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,340
Alright, 10 games a year.

1062
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,180
None of these are...

1063
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,040
Okay, that's 10 games a year.

1064
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,100
I mean, it's not...

1065
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,200
I guess...

1066
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,060
I mean...

1067
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,040
A whopping 48.

1068
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,860
I mean, I guess they just make 10 games a year.

1069
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,270
But how many of them are good games?

1070
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,550
What the fuck is Feed My Raptor?

1071
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,270
What?

1072
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,750
They made a sequel to it?

1073
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:27,410
What?

1074
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,290
Wait.

1075
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,690
What is this game?

1076
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,430
Feed My Raptor.

1077
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:33,810
A PS5 exclusive.

1078
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,290
What did I do?

1079
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,050
And they made a sequel.

1080
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:37,850
I'm fucking...

1081
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,350
I'm watching this game.

1082
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,690
Feed My...

1083
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,810
It's 2 minutes long.

1084
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,130
This is not a game.

1085
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,310
What do you mean?

1086
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,730
What is this game?

1087
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:57,250
Guys, this is one of the exclusives on the PS5.

1088
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,910
And it's called...

1089
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,010
And it's 2 minutes long.

1090
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,650
And it's just like...

1091
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:03,910
Feed...

1092
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,350
That's the game.

1093
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,790
And there is a sequel.

1094
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,050
You're just feeding...

1095
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,470
What the fuck is Feed My Raptor 2?

1096
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,290
What is this?

1097
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,410
It's one...

1098
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,070
It's one...

1099
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,170
Why would you pay for this?

1100
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:23,810
Why?

1101
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,710
What the fuck?

1102
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,550
Why is it?

1103
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,810
What the fuck?

1104
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,490
You know what?

1105
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,190
What do I...

1106
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,170
That's a good idea.

1107
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:32,770
I'm gonna...

1108
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,050
Okay.

1109
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:33,830
I'm gonna...

1110
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,670
I'm gonna write that down.

1111
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:36,070
Re...

1112
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,490
Stream...

1113
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,550
Feed...

1114
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,010
My Raptor.

1115
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,810
I see why there's only 48.

1116
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:53,090
They made a sequel to Feed My Raptor.

1117
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,890
There's a sequel.

1118
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:58,970
There's...

1119
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,830
How many views?

1120
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,350
That video I just...

1121
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,010
You...

1122
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,170
That video I just linked you had 300 views.

1123
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,110
And it was...

1124
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:07,730
Oh my god.

1125
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,490
That guy's gonna be like...

1126
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:16,250
Why is there so many people suddenly watching my Feed My Raptor tutorial on how they kept...

1127
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,950
Man, so many people suddenly wanna get the trophy for Feed My Raptor.

1128
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,990
I wonder why.

1129
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,950
I...

1130
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,470
I...

1131
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,810
I wonder why so many people wanted to feed their...

1132
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,570
Play Feed My Raptor today.

1133
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,930
The hit game.

1134
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:37,670
Guys, that's...

1135
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,950
This is a PS5 exclusive, by the way.

1136
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,090
Feed My Raptor.

1137
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,290
And the very hyped, enjoyable Feed My Raptor 2.

1138
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,950
Coming to your local theaters.

1139
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,130
When will we get Feed My Raptor 3?

1140
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,410
When?

1141
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,570
That's what I'm talking about.

1142
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:02,190
I've been waiting 20 years for Feed My Raptor 3.

1143
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,150
Let's see.

1144
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,750
Oh yeah, there's Death Stranding 2 on the...

1145
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,530
On the...

1146
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,610
Oh, I can't...

1147
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,970
They have to make the new Kingdom Hearts game in a PS5 exclusive, right?

1148
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,710
Which might not be released ever.

1149
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:20,690
Because like...

1150
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,430
I'm just wondering.

1151
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,450
Are they gonna...

1152
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,310
Are they gonna recast Sora?

1153
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,790
Like, I'm just...

1154
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,670
I'm...

1155
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,630
Um...

1156
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,210
I'm wondering...

1157
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:33,710
Um...

1158
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,870
Hmm...

1159
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,870
What's gonna happen with the Sora situation?

1160
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,870
I'm just...

1161
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,250
Like...

1162
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,170
That's like...

1163
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,690
The question here.

1164
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,350
Is it...

1165
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,590
They didn't...

1166
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,470
They didn't say anything.

1167
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,550
What happened with Sora?

1168
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,190
The guy who voice asked Sora got arrested.

1169
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,470
And...

1170
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,110
So...

1171
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,810
And so like...

1172
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,370
Um...

1173
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:03,090
Because it was like...

1174
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:03,890
Apparently...

1175
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,210
It was like...

1176
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:05,930
He was like...

1177
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,210
Like his home burned down or something.

1178
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,770
So he went on like a psychotic...

1179
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:11,090
Like...

1180
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:11,730
What was it called?

1181
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:12,950
When...

1182
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,290
Um...

1183
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:14,610
A psychotic mental break.

1184
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,070
Um...

1185
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:16,750
From it.

1186
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:17,050
Yeah.

1187
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,330
And he got like really drunk.

1188
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,650
And like...

1189
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,190
Uh...

1190
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,870
You know...

1191
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,030
Really messed...

1192
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,410
Like...

1193
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:23,610
Yeah.

1194
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:24,190
Yeah.

1195
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,090
And he's like going through it right now.

1196
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,310
But then it all got recorded.

1197
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,330
It...

1198
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:29,610
Yeah.

1199
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,950
He had a mental breakdown.

1200
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,230
And it all got recorded.

1201
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,310
And he said...

1202
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,270
He said some things.

1203
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,350
So like...

1204
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,090
I'm like...

1205
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:36,370
Wait...

1206
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,190
What's gonna...

1207
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,130
What's gonna happen to Kingdom Hearts 4 after that?

1208
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,290
Like...

1209
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,730
I was like...

1210
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,090
Yeah.

1211
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,070
Yeah.

1212
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,270
So like...

1213
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,750
There has been like...

1214
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,330
No...

1215
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,150
Nothing related to it.

1216
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,410
There's been...

1217
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:53,770
Uh...

1218
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,210
Nothing related to it.

1219
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,110
But like...

1220
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,250
It's still...

1221
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,010
You're just...

1222
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,250
Everyone's like...

1223
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,410
What's gonna happen?

1224
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:01,990
Like...

1225
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,490
Like...

1226
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:05,030
Like...

1227
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,410
And it's all like...

1228
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,190
Up in the air.

1229
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,230
But we have...

1230
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,130
We also like...

1231
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,410
Haven't had any...

1232
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,430
Uh...

1233
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,050
We also have...

1234
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,370
Haven't had any like...

1235
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,810
Updates recently...

1236
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,210
On Kingdom Hearts 4...

1237
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,930
In a very, very long time.

1238
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,310
So we don't know...

1239
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,030
Um...

1240
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:22,650
We don't...

1241
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,150
Like...

1242
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,470
We don't know what's gonna happen.

1243
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,750
And I feel like...

1244
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:27,370
Honestly...

1245
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,070
With the raid...

1246
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,770
Honestly...

1247
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,470
I just hope...

1248
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,770
If Kingdom Hearts 4...

1249
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,050
Like...

1250
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,130
Whatever they're gonna do...

1251
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,050
What are they gonna do with Sora?

1252
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,330
I do hope they don't...

1253
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,350
Rush anything...

1254
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,710
They don't rush anything...

1255
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,330
Because Kingdom Hearts 3...

1256
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,410
Fucking sucked.

1257
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,330
I think we all know...

1258
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,010
I literally...

1259
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,990
I told you guys...

1260
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,530
I stopped playing Kingdom Hearts 3...

1261
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,330
After like...

1262
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:50,950
Two worlds.

1263
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,730
After I got to the Elsa world...

1264
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,670
I was so fucking bored.

1265
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:55,530
Like...

1266
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:55,610
I...

1267
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,350
I just...

1268
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:56,850
No, I didn't enjoy it.

1269
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:57,010
But...

1270
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:57,790
And even then...

1271
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,530
It took them so long to develop.

1272
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:00,550
I'm like...

1273
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,490
Kingdom Hearts...

1274
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,250
Uh...

1275
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:02,990
2...

1276
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,430
Was released on...

1277
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:05,790
2005...

1278
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,150
And Kingdom Hearts 3...

1279
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,870
Uh...

1280
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,370
Was released in 2019.

1281
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,610
And even then...

1282
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,610
I was like...

1283
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,050
I...

1284
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:14,350
I...

1285
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:15,050
I don't know.

1286
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:16,790
I don't know.

1287
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,430
Maybe it's because the story...

1288
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:18,750
I...

1289
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,710
I didn't like it.

1290
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,530
I didn't like it.

1291
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,750
I know some people are like...

1292
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,530
Oh, I like it.

1293
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,010
But like for me...

1294
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:24,510
I...

1295
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,410
I feel like...

1296
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,150
Uh...

1297
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,070
I feel like for me...

1298
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,930
I just didn't enjoy Kingdom Hearts 3 anymore.

1299
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:33,770
I just felt...

1300
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,070
The story for me...

1301
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:35,550
And like...

1302
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,110
How it progressed was like...

1303
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:37,750
Not as good.

1304
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:38,930
Uh...

1305
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:45,470
Not as good as, like, Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2, and it was... I just felt like... It felt... I don't know.

1306
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:51,350
People were saying it was because it got rushed, so I hope they, like... They, like, fixed the issues for it.

1307
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,950
Um, and then I didn't even, like... I didn't even... I couldn't even keep playing at that point.

1308
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,290
I just looked up screenshots of what the other worlds were.

1309
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,190
But it was just... Maybe it's because, like... What worlds did they choose, anyway?

1310
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,090
Worlds.

1311
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,230
What worlds did they choose?

1312
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,350
They chose Frozen, Monster Inc.

1313
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,170
Uh, Big Hero 6.

1314
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,170
Okay, what were the worlds in Kingdom Hearts 3?

1315
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,710
Uh, Toy Story.

1316
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,130
Um, thank you for the raid, Hanta.

1317
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,210
Thank you, thank you.

1318
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,730
Oh, I'm just gonna do and say it.

1319
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,270
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

1320
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:35,710
Dude, is that your confession for today?

1321
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,450
Thank you for the super chat, T-Dragon.

1322
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,250
Thank you, thank you.

1323
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:41,330
Next seat.

1324
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,570
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1325
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,990
Uh, Joki, there were, like, five Kingdom Hearts games between two and three.

1326
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,230
They didn't start development on three for ages.

1327
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,190
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1328
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:53,950
Yeah, there's so many.

1329
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,570
That's why I also didn't, like...

1330
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:01,610
There were, like, a million spinoffs that told, like, a million side stories of everything.

1331
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:10,490
And then you're supposed to, like, know what the fuck was happening in these side stories going in to Kingdom Hearts 3.

1332
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:16,690
And then, like, it made me even more confused with what the fuck was going on.

1333
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:23,010
Because I quit... I... Obviously, I didn't play all the side story games that...

1334
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,570
That was going on.

1335
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:34,610
And there was, like, extra plot in, like, the mobile games and everything.

1336
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:39,290
And, like... Because, like, I didn't... I didn't... I didn't, like...

1337
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,830
Obviously, I didn't play all of them in between.

1338
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,630
I think the one I remember playing the cards one...

1339
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,550
Oh, my God!

1340
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:45,890
Yes!

1341
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,970
There was, like, one!

1342
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,010
I remember in Kingdom Hearts 2...

1343
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,990
Okay, they started doing this in between Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts 2.

1344
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,550
Where, like, you know how, like, Zora forgets all his memories?

1345
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,910
And he gets into a fucking pod?

1346
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,670
And then... But then... And then Kingdom Hearts 2, you're, like...

1347
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:04,830
You know, you're Roxas.

1348
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,090
And you're just, like, wait...

1349
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,610
And then I remember as a little kid, I was, like, why is he in the pod?

1350
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,630
And then you're supposed to play Chain of Memories in between?

1351
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,330
You're supposed to play Chain of Memories to figure out what was...

1352
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:20,050
That led to how he gets into the pod.

1353
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,890
But they only did that...

1354
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,890
Like, they did one of that, you know?

1355
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,050
It was just one of that moment that happened.

1356
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:34,250
So that explains why he's in the giant white pod and everything.

1357
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,910
Wait, was it released after?

1358
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,050
I don't remember.

1359
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,890
I was just, like, why is he in that thing?

1360
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,250
I was so confused.

1361
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,150
I thought it was, like, before.

1362
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,290
No, it wasn't.

1363
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,650
No, it was in between, wasn't it?

1364
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,950
I thought it was in...

1365
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,810
Yeah, it was before.

1366
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:53,110
Yeah.

1367
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,970
And it was a GBA game.

1368
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,150
Yeah, it was a Game Boy Advance game.

1369
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:04,630
And you're supposed to play the Game Boy Advance game to know what the fuck to progress into Kingdom Hearts 2.

1370
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:11,630
And it explains everything as to why he was trapped in this fucking white pod.

1371
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:17,830
But, like, obviously, in Kingdom Hearts 2, when you're playing it, you wouldn't know that.

1372
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,050
Because, like, you're too busy being like, ooh, Roxas Axel.

1373
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,190
You know?

1374
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:32,490
You wouldn't, like, the Roxas Axel distracts you from the fact that you're missing, like, this entire plotline of how he got into that pod.

1375
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:38,250
You're like, because you...

1376
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:43,450
Because you're just like, yay, Roxas!

1377
00:55:51,190 --> 00:56:02,230
So, like, I didn't, like, realize, like, I, like, ignored the whole thing of why, like, Sora was there and how Rox is, and, like, why Sora was there and everything.

1378
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:06,150
And then, obviously, I got to play Chain of Memories.

1379
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,710
Like, later on, they re-released Chain of Memories.

1380
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:16,630
They re-made Chain of Memories into, yeah, that was my jingle jangle that they did to me.

1381
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:28,430
But they released Chain of Memories, um, uh, re-made it into, like, the PlayStation 2, or was it, yeah, to the PlayStation 2 and, like, re-made it for PlayStation 2.

1382
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,350
Or was it PlayStation 3?

1383
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:29,990
I don't remember.

1384
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,030
It was so long ago.

1385
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,070
They made a console version of it.

1386
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:39,150
And that's when, when I played it, I was like, oh my god, was that what's happening?

1387
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,450
I was like, I was like, wait a minute.

1388
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,870
That's why I was trapped?

1389
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:51,090
Like, I was like, this, all of the, I was supposed to know all of this going in?

1390
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:56,290
Like, oh no, don't worry.

1391
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,310
I played that one.

1392
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,030
I don't worry.

1393
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,370
Don't worry.

1394
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,530
I got you.

1395
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,690
I definitely played that one.

1396
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,230
Um, Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

1397
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:07,130
Thank you, thank you.

1398
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,450
These are the spinoffs I played.

1399
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:16,370
I played 358 slash 2 days and Chain of Memories on the console.

1400
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,730
Those were the two spinoffs I played.

1401
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:23,210
But apparently, there's a million more that I missed out on.

1402
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,670
Like, Birth by Sleep.

1403
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,770
Like, I did not play Birth by Sleep.

1404
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:33,330
Um, so like, that confused me as well.

1405
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:38,730
Because that talks about the Keyblade Wars, right?

1406
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:44,210
That was where the Keyblade Wars was supposed to be.

1407
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,330
And that explains more about it.

1408
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,170
And about, like, Xehanort?

1409
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,350
I don't...

1410
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,350
Organization 13?

1411
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,870
Explains Organization 13?

1412
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,630
And, um, yeah.

1413
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,630
So like, I didn't play that one.

1414
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,450
Because it was, um...

1415
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,570
Oh no, the Keyblade Wars was a mobile game?

1416
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,530
Jesus Christ, I...

1417
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:15,390
This is why the creator of Kingdom Hearts have to look up recap videos whenever he develops a new Kingdom Hearts.

1418
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,070
Um, no, not the Organization 13.

1419
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,310
It was the...

1420
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:23,390
The guys before they became nobodies.

1421
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,150
Oh my god, this is so confusing.

1422
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:29,930
Because they...

1423
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,170
They show up.

1424
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:33,710
Um...

1425
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,910
Before they became nobodies.

1426
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,890
They're in that game.

1427
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,390
And, like...

1428
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,950
It talks about their backstories.

1429
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,590
And how all of them are technically connected.

1430
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,490
And how that came to be.

1431
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:48,990
And then...

1432
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:49,770
Oh my god.

1433
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,150
And then...

1434
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,790
Also, by the way, if you guys didn't know...

1435
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:58,370
The creator and writer of Kingdom Hearts...

1436
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,370
Fucking has to look up recap videos...

1437
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:02,890
Of other YouTubers...

1438
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,010
Connecting everything.

1439
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,650
Because even he doesn't fucking remember.

1440
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,530
Because it's so complicated.

1441
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,490
He doesn't even remember what the fuck is going on.

1442
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,750
But he made so many games...

1443
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,670
On different consoles...

1444
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,930
And mobile games...

1445
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,490
That explain the plot.

1446
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,150
And you have to buy them on different platforms...

1447
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:29,470
To understand what the fuck is going on.

1448
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,630
And I think in Kingdom Hearts 3...

1449
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,850
I was so confused.

1450
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,090
Because I was like...

1451
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,750
What the fuck is that...

1452
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,750
I was like...

1453
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,650
Why...

1454
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,310
Oh my god.

1455
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,870
I got so confused in Kingdom Hearts 3.

1456
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,330
Like, it started getting really confusing.

1457
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:44,910
I...

1458
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,990
And then that's why I wasn't into the story...

1459
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:49,390
Anymore...

1460
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:54,690
Anymore...

1461
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:56,050
Like...

1462
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:56,430
It can...

1463
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,770
Yeah, it continues...

1464
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,050
Apparently, it continues...

1465
00:59:59,050 --> 00:59:59,770
Plot points...

1466
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,290
From a mobile game...

1467
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,910
That wasn't even finished...

1468
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,650
And I was like...

1469
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,470
I was supposed to know that?

1470
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,830
I was supposed to know all of that?

1471
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,350
Like...

1472
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,050
I just want to be a funny...

1473
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:19,730
Final...

1474
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,930
I just want to be a funny anime boy...

1475
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,230
In the Disneyland world...

1476
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,670
I just...

1477
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,010
I don't know what I'm doing...

1478
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,150
I...

1479
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,910
At least...

1480
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,110
What are these original characters...

1481
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,730
Doing in my anime Disney game?

1482
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,150
Get them out of here!

1483
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,630
Put more Final Fantasy characters in here...

1484
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,930
If you want anime characters!

1485
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,170
Get these original characters...

1486
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,190
Out of my way!

1487
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,730
I'm just here for my...

1488
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,750
Disney characters...

1489
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,090
My...

1490
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,450
Disney characters!

1491
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,150
Um...

1492
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,070
Zyko...

1493
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,410
Thank you for the super chat...

1494
01:00:59,410 --> 01:00:59,850
Thank you...

1495
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:00,550
Thank you...

1496
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,950
I still have Kingdom Hearts 3.

1497
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,410
You're getting disgruntled in the backlog corner...

1498
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,690
Because I'm lazy to go through all the recap videos!

1499
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,490
Thank you for the super chat!

1500
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:09,990
Thank you!

1501
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:10,690
Thank you!

1502
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:11,830
Thorn came!

1503
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,030
Thank you for the super chat!

1504
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:13,450
Thank you!

1505
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,150
Thank you!

1506
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,790
Ha ha ha ha!

1507
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,160
But Donald, you see the player!

1508
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,820
Guys, I don't need more original characters...

1509
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,260
In my Kingdom Hearts game!

1510
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,960
I'm barely like...

1511
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,660
The last...

1512
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,840
Okay, I would say...

1513
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,100
I would say...

1514
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:36,780
I would say...

1515
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,840
That...

1516
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,980
I would say that...

1517
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,020
Organization 13...

1518
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,620
Were good OCs that he's created...

1519
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,660
But then it all went downhill...

1520
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,660
They all went...

1521
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,000
Ha ha ha!

1522
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,420
Ha ha ha!

1523
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,080
Ha ha ha!

1524
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,320
I...

1525
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,700
I don't know any other good OCs that he made after that...

1526
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,000
After the other OC inserts that he made...

1527
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,540
I...

1528
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,720
Not even...

1529
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,180
Okay!

1530
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,020
But because there were 13 of them...

1531
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,160
Like...

1532
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,060
Only one...

1533
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,040
They had one for every flavor...

1534
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:09,740
You know?

1535
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,080
Like...

1536
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,560
For like...

1537
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:10,840
You know...

1538
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,540
If you were like a particular character archetype thing...

1539
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,480
Um...

1540
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,480
A particular character archetype that you liked...

1541
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,180
Then like...

1542
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,340
There's one for you in Organization 13...

1543
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:24,600
You know?

1544
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,540
Like...

1545
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,180
There's like...

1546
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,160
Oh, I like this type of person...

1547
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,040
And then they like...

1548
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,760
Obviously it's like one for each per...

1549
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,140
Like...

1550
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,760
One for each person...

1551
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,020
You know?

1552
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,540
Ha ha ha ha!

1553
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,980
So maybe like...

1554
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,540
You know...

1555
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,360
Oh man...

1556
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,960
I hate this type...

1557
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,020
But I like that other...

1558
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:43,560
I like hate this member...

1559
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,380
But I like...

1560
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,920
The other member...

1561
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,580
And then...

1562
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:48,660
And then you'd be like...

1563
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,000
But then someone else would be like...

1564
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,580
How dare you?

1565
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,680
I like this member...

1566
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,860
And hate your member...

1567
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,060
And I like how someone was like...

1568
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,120
Aqua was good...

1569
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,700
Yes, because there's barely any female OCs in Kingdom Hearts.

1570
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:09,700
Of course, in a C, there's barely any female OCs that he inputted in Kingdom Hearts.

1571
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,820
Like, you just take what you can get.

1572
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,300
If you think about it, it's the worst.

1573
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,060
You're right.

1574
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,320
There's Xeon crying.

1575
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,860
And they... Okay, also, I just realized there's like...

1576
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,720
And it's all, like, Kairi recolored.

1577
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,580
It's like, Kairi in different recolored different colors.

1578
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,800
Like, pick a new hairstyle.

1579
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,820
Why are they all the same hairstyle?

1580
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,220
It's like, and then you're like, that's not true.

1581
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,100
We have Naminé.

1582
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,840
Naminé is just Kairi, but her hair is slightly longer.

1583
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,800
And she's blonde.

1584
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,900
They're all just different colors of Kairi.

1585
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,920
For real.

1586
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,020
We've got blonde, black hair, and blue hair.

1587
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,500
And then if you want the original...

1588
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,740
It's just...

1589
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,840
They're just all recolored versions of hair.

1590
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,740
Like...

1591
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:26,710
You can't say it.

1592
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:27,710
You know I'm right.

1593
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,210
You know I'm right.

1594
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:38,990
And then if you think about it, the only woman in Organization 13 is just...

1595
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:42,390
Also, you could say it's just her.

1596
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,770
But, like, she's a bad girl.

1597
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,450
You could technically...

1598
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,370
Could be like...

1599
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,550
Like...

1600
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,130
What's her name?

1601
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:55,210
Larxene?

1602
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:55,730
Is that...

1603
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,590
That's her name, right?

1604
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:57,430
Okay.

1605
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,550
Yeah, but it's almost the same.

1606
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:05,630
If you realize if her hair was not slicked back, it's the same hairstyle.

1607
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,490
She's just older.

1608
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,190
And her hair is slicked back.

1609
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,670
But if you realize her hair...

1610
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:17,150
If you realize when her hair isn't slicked back, it's literally the same hairstyle.

1611
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,630
And then she...

1612
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:20,750
Kairi...

1613
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:27,400
He is...

1614
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,270
Um...

1615
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:32,350
It's still...

1616
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,270
Alright.

1617
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:34,270
Okay.

1618
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:34,870
Sorry.

1619
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:38,590
I just need to get that out here for those who are in...

1620
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:39,130
I just...

1621
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:39,450
I...

1622
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,110
That was like an epiphany for me.

1623
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,430
I was just like, wait, there's barely...

1624
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,090
Barely...

1625
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,990
There's like, you don't have much choice here.

1626
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:49,630
There's not a lot of choices for the female OCs in Kingdom Hearts.

1627
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:53,430
Um...

1628
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:56,250
He finally released your...

1629
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,790
It's like, oh yeah, but I wanna...

1630
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:02,530
There's literally only one, like, the bad girl, and that's her.

1631
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,770
The ranting is real.

1632
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,330
I guess like, if you want more...

1633
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:11,590
I guess like, what the mode...

1634
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:16,150
The gacha game had more female characters, but then you have to play the Kingdom Hearts gacha game.

1635
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,590
That shut down.

1636
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,270
If you wanted more pickings.

1637
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:28,310
The many sides of Kairi.

1638
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,070
Oh, sorry.

1639
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,010
I got really passionate there.

1640
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,790
I actually really liked Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 growing up.

1641
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:43,550
I was just very disappointed that Kingdom Hearts 3 was fucking terrible.

1642
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,990
I was so disappointed in that.

1643
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:50,570
Like, that was just the rage that built up inside me.

1644
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:53,590
How bad they handled it.

1645
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,930
Because I had to know a million things.

1646
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,850
It's like...

1647
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:57,610
It's like Marvel.

1648
01:06:58,190 --> 01:06:58,790
Um...

1649
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,170
I feel like...

1650
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:01,830
I don't watch Marvel movies.

1651
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:02,790
Generally.

1652
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,230
Because I said like, I'm not really into Marvel...

1653
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,630
The Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1654
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,770
But I heard that...

1655
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:09,870
Um...

1656
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:15,630
I heard that like, in the current Marvel Cinematic Universe, people are not really like...

1657
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,610
That into...

1658
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:21,930
They're not really into the Marvel Cinematic Universe anymore.

1659
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:27,790
And like, apparently the CEO that handles the MCU...

1660
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:28,510
Or like...

1661
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:29,210
What do you say called CEO?

1662
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,630
The director for...

1663
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:34,270
Like, the guy...

1664
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,930
The main guy that handles the MCU.

1665
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,550
Is like...

1666
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,870
Saying that there's an issue right now.

1667
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,290
And it's that...

1668
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,270
It's so bloated.

1669
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:43,690
Where...

1670
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:44,610
Where like...

1671
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,430
You have to...

1672
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:46,950
To understand the newer movies.

1673
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:48,950
You have to understand...

1674
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:51,030
The 20 plus years...

1675
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,030
Of lore.

1676
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,630
That they built into it.

1677
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,670
To understand the newer movies.

1678
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,270
And if you like...

1679
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:00,730
Miss out on something.

1680
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,290
And they're all like...

1681
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,390
On like Disney Plus.

1682
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:05,090
Or like on TV shows.

1683
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:05,690
Right?

1684
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:06,370
And it's like...

1685
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,610
Some of them is like...

1686
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,630
Plot within TV shows too.

1687
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,270
So it's like...

1688
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,830
So it's like...

1689
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,190
It...

1690
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,110
It gets really rough.

1691
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,450
Because you have to watch...

1692
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,450
A TV show.

1693
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,650
From beginning to end.

1694
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:18,670
To like...

1695
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,790
Understand...

1696
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,090
What the fuck is going on.

1697
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,390
In some of the newer movies.

1698
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:23,990
And now I'm like...

1699
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:25,150
I...

1700
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,210
I...

1701
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,610
It's just hard for newer viewers.

1702
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,770
To get into.

1703
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:29,990
To...

1704
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,230
Because if you're like...

1705
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:31,870
A newer viewer.

1706
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,710
That wants to get into like...

1707
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,010
The...

1708
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,570
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1709
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,190
You have to watch...

1710
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,690
A bunch of like...

1711
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,610
Stuff that happened before then.

1712
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:42,530
To go straight into a new...

1713
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:43,710
Marvel movie.

1714
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:44,770
To understand...

1715
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,070
The context of what's going on.

1716
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,590
It's hard to just like...

1717
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:49,470
Watch the movie.

1718
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,750
And realize what the fuck is happening.

1719
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,590
If you didn't watch...

1720
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,070
What the fuck was happening...

1721
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,090
Before then.

1722
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,310
On like...

1723
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,230
The TV shows.

1724
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,130
Or like...

1725
01:08:59,130 --> 01:08:59,610
The movies.

1726
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,170
To figure out...

1727
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,390
Where it's progressing.

1728
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:03,130
Or like...

1729
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,310
And they'll introduce like...

1730
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:04,850
Characters.

1731
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:06,410
That might have shown up.

1732
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:07,450
In the TV show.

1733
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,430
And you're like...

1734
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,170
Who's that?

1735
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,130
You're like...

1736
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,250
Oh that guy?

1737
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,630
And you're like...

1738
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:14,390
Who's that?

1739
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,810
Why are they treating it...

1740
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,230
As if I know who he is?

1741
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,150
And you're like...

1742
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:18,430
Oh yeah.

1743
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:18,930
That guy?

1744
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,490
He had his own show.

1745
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,330
On Disney Plus.

1746
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,490
And he was like...

1747
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,150
A really well liked character there.

1748
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:29,770
And that's why he got promoted to the movie, because it's very important to the plotline, too.

1749
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:35,310
And you're just like, okay, so he just shows up as if I know who he is?

1750
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:45,950
Because I remember... I don't remember which movie it was that I watched.

1751
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:50,670
I remember, like, I tried to watch some of the newer movies that are out.

1752
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,510
And I was like, who the fuck is that guy?

1753
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,750
And then... and I'm just so confused.

1754
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:56,750
And I googled him?

1755
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:00,030
Because they don't... it's like he's there as if he's always there.

1756
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,590
So, like, I didn't understand.

1757
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:03,730
And they had to google it.

1758
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:06,570
And they're like, oh, yeah, his first appearance is in this TV show.

1759
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,230
And I was like, what the...

1760
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:15,350
If I have to Wikipedia your character...

1761
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:19,130
Because if I have to Wikipedia slash...

1762
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,530
I don't know...

1763
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,010
Adgrok, who is he?

1764
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:29,710
Adgrok, who is this character in the movie?

1765
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,190
Then that's a problem for me.

1766
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,470
That's a huge problem.

1767
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,790
So...

1768
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,850
Is this true?

1769
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,410
Is this real?

1770
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,090
Adgrok, where is this movie from?

1771
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,190
Wait, what movie is this?

1772
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,310
Adgrok.

1773
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,470
Don't speak his name.

1774
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:51,290
Don't worry.

1775
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:52,430
I don't use...

1776
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:52,910
Guys, okay.

1777
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:54,910
Um...

1778
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,590
I don't use Grok, but I'm...

1779
01:10:56,590 --> 01:11:01,090
Okay, if you're in the member stream, you'll realize how much I fucking hate the Adgrok shit.

1780
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:05,150
Because, like, I can't get real answers anymore on Twitter.

1781
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,750
Everybody just does, like, Adgrok.

1782
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,590
Is this real?

1783
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,570
Adgrok.

1784
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,670
Where is this from?

1785
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:11,870
There's, like...

1786
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,730
Nobody gives you replies anymore.

1787
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,810
I remember if I don't know where something is from, or if somebody is explaining context...

1788
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,530
A real person will explain it to me.

1789
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:23,390
Or, like, tell me where it's from.

1790
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:26,450
But now, everybody is using Adgrok.

1791
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,730
And sometimes, it's not even accurate.

1792
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,930
It tells me something so different.

1793
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,570
And I'm tired.

1794
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,390
I'm so tired.

1795
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,970
It's just all Adgrok.

1796
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:44,790
I need to know where is this clip from?

1797
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,830
Please tell me.

1798
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:47,910
Ad chat.

1799
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,090
Is this real?

1800
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:50,090
No name.

1801
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:51,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1802
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:51,570
Thank you.

1803
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,150
Thank you.

1804
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,230
I'm tired of this, Grandpa.

1805
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:03,420
Yeah.

1806
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,380
Also, like, speaking of AI.

1807
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:11,140
I don't know if anybody saw this article that popped up that went viral about how...

1808
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:17,120
I know I talked about this in members about, like, using AI for college.

1809
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,320
And there was, like, uh...

1810
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,840
And right after I had that discussion in the member stream, um...

1811
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,280
I saw a Twitter...

1812
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,180
A viral Twitter thread of, like, um...

1813
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,580
A viral, like, art...

1814
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,360
Like, a viral Twitter article about, like, how more and more...

1815
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:42,120
Different students are now using AI, even in Ivy League, to do their assignments.

1816
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,540
It was crazy.

1817
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,580
There was, like...

1818
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,720
Okay, they got this, like, statement from a student.

1819
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,620
And, like...

1820
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,260
Okay, I was, like...

1821
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,180
Um...

1822
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,380
I was, like...

1823
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,140
X for doubt.

1824
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,140
Because this student...

1825
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,740
Okay, this student was, like...

1826
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,380
I'll read this article to you.

1827
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,500
Because I, like, saved it.

1828
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,700
Because I was, like, what the fuck?

1829
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:02,840
Like, there's no...

1830
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,680
You did something.

1831
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:06,940
So, like...

1832
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,240
It was, like...

1833
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,120
Basically...

1834
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,060
Okay, let me read this.

1835
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,100
Uh...

1836
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,000
Uh...

1837
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,280
Uh...

1838
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,100
Lee stepped into Columbia University campus this past fall.

1839
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,500
Columbia, I believe, is an Ivy League.

1840
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,140
Uh...

1841
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:30,140
By his own admission, proceeded to use generative artificial intelligence to cheat on nearly every assignment.

1842
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:35,960
As a computer science major, he depended on AI for his programming classes.

1843
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:42,580
I just dumped the prompt into ChatGPT and handed in whatever it, um...

1844
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,180
Spat out.

1845
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,100
AI wrote 80% of every essay he turned in.

1846
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,900
I'm just, like...

1847
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:50,880
Jesus Christ.

1848
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,980
Bro, you're in Columbia University.

1849
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,580
Like...

1850
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,480
Oh, my God.

1851
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,640
And he was, like...

1852
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,300
Yeah...

1853
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,820
I got accepted into Harvard early.

1854
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,220
But then...

1855
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,740
The university resigned his offer.

1856
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,680
Because he said...

1857
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:13,740
He got suspended for sneaking out during the overnight field trip before graduation.

1858
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,060
And a year later, he tried to apply to 26 schools.

1859
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,920
But he got rejected in all of them.

1860
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,360
So, I was, like...

1861
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,320
What did he do?

1862
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,700
What did he actually do?

1863
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,880
There's no way.

1864
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,420
There's...

1865
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,500
He did something.

1866
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,140
There's no way.

1867
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,960
You sneaked out during a field trip.

1868
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,240
And then Harvard was, like...

1869
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,260
No, no, no.

1870
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,440
No bad boys in my university.

1871
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,080
Sneaking out during a field trip?

1872
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,080
That's a bad boy thing to do.

1873
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,440
Harvard students have done way more fucked up shit than that.

1874
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,140
While they're in Harvard.

1875
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,920
And they're still in Harvard.

1876
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:00,920
And...

1877
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,120
That's like...

1878
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,500
He...

1879
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,080
Did something.

1880
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,140
Wasn't there a thing?

1881
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,000
Okay.

1882
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:11,440
Okay.

1883
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,400
I'll say, like...

1884
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,200
I don't want, like...

1885
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,140
I don't want the...

1886
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,080
The...

1887
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,900
UK secret society get to me.

1888
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:18,880
But, like...

1889
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,420
Hypothetically...

1890
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,340
Isn't there a secret society...

1891
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,140
In Oxford.

1892
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,360
Where all the...

1893
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,460
The big people...

1894
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,820
Who may or may not...

1895
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,260
Have been...

1896
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,160
Prime ministers.

1897
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:35,700
So...

1898
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,160
Who...

1899
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,760
May or may not...

1900
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,700
Be prime ministers...

1901
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,260
Uh...

1902
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:44,880
Of...

1903
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,760
Of the UK...

1904
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,220
In secret...

1905
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,240
In lot of secret societies.

1906
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,720
In, like, you know...

1907
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,480
Fraternities.

1908
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,920
In, like, you know...

1909
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,060
Some of the...

1910
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,780
Ivy League...

1911
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,280
The Ivy Leagues...

1912
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,260
Of, like...

1913
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:05,860
The UK.

1914
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:06,860
You know...

1915
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,040
May or may not...

1916
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:08,880
You know...

1917
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:12,800
Like...

1918
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,600
Some schools...

1919
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,700
Like...

1920
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,140
Potentially...

1921
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,140
You know...

1922
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:19,880
Oxford.

1923
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:20,860
Or, like...

1924
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,380
Cambridge.

1925
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,520
There was a...

1926
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:23,940
Society there.

1927
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,380
Like a...

1928
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:24,660
Like...

1929
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,120
It's sort of like a fraternity there.

1930
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,540
That may or may not...

1931
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,600
Hypothetically...

1932
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,200
Where...

1933
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,560
Some of the students there...

1934
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,340
Did some really fucked up shit.

1935
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,200
And they were...

1936
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:33,640
Got there.

1937
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,560
And then they may or may not...

1938
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,600
Become prime minister.

1939
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,340
Or holding very big positions of power.

1940
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,680
But this random kid...

1941
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,460
Skipped...

1942
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,220
Sneaked out...

1943
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,840
For an overnight field trip.

1944
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,480
And then proceeds...

1945
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,040
To get rejected...

1946
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,980
In 26 other schools.

1947
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,680
So what did he do?

1948
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,020
What did he really do?

1949
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,920
There was no way...

1950
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,760
That...

1951
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,000
It was just...

1952
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,040
Sneaking out.

1953
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,320
You know too much.

1954
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,460
He didn't have enough power...

1955
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,600
To cover it up.

1956
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,180
Not good enough for hybrid.

1957
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,840
Holy shit.

1958
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:22,400
Next team.

1959
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1960
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:23,860
Thank you.

1961
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,580
Thank you.

1962
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:26,400
The Ivy League equivalent...

1963
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,260
Is Red Bricks...

1964
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,540
Or just Oxbridge...

1965
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,540
For the top tier.

1966
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,280
Dubkeeper...

1967
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:31,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1968
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,260
Thank you.

1969
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:32,840
Thank you.

1970
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:34,360
Apparently it's a thing to say...

1971
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,040
Chat is Israel.

1972
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,320
But it's actually...

1973
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,380
Chat GPT.

1974
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,780
Mr. Sen...

1975
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1976
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,020
Thank you.

1977
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,420
Thank you.

1978
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,980
It was nice knowing...

1979
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,080
You don't keep lying.

1980
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,360
I put that...

1981
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,340
In Minecraft...

1982
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:46,480
Sorry.

1983
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,600
I forgot to add...

1984
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,220
In Minecraft...

1985
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:49,740
Obviously.

1986
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:50,820
Minecraft...

1987
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,280
Minecraft Oxford.

1988
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:52,920
You know?

1989
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,960
That's my favorite Minecraft server, guys.

1990
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,080
That's...

1991
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,500
That makes it...

1992
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,100
Okay.

1993
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,200
That makes it all right, chat.

1994
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,320
Never mind.

1995
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,200
She's cool.

1996
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,320
Um, yeah.

1997
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:07,760
Goddamn.

1998
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:15,300
I love playing that Minecraft server where you can pretend to go to Minecraft Oxford in-game in Minecraft.

1999
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,140
Uh, but anyway.

2000
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,960
Yeah, so, like, they're talking about... Oh, my God.

2001
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,680
This article is actually... I'm gonna link it to you guys so you can read, like, the quotes.

2002
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,940
Because I was reading the quotes of it.

2003
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,020
Of this article.

2004
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,180
And it's...

2005
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,880
It's actually... It's actually so interesting.

2006
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:36,520
I was like, wait, that's what's going on in university right now?

2007
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,720
But, like, I'll send you guys a link to it.

2008
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,440
And, like, on Twitter.

2009
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:43,680
And then you guys can, like, read through it.

2010
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:45,020
It's actually super interesting.

2011
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:52,960
I... Um... Because, like, you know... Um... I graduated university before ChatGPD was a thing.

2012
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,540
So, like, obviously, I had to actually go to the library.

2013
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:57,900
And...

2014
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,820
I had to go to the library.

2015
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,180
I had to go to the library.

2016
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,780
I had to go to Google Scholar.

2017
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:08,600
Or, like, go to my library website to find books that was related to my topic.

2018
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:11,260
And I had to actually look... Read the books.

2019
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,560
Read.

2020
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,060
Or, like, go to Google Scholar to find research articles.

2021
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,940
And I couldn't do... At G... At Grok, please explain this.

2022
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:25,660
Please.

2023
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,340
I had to actually go to my library.

2024
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,080
My university library.

2025
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,580
And, like, take out the books related to the topic I wanted to do.

2026
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:37,780
Like...

2027
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:38,900
Uh...

2028
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:39,100
Alright, C.

2029
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,220
Thank you for the super chat.

2030
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:40,580
Thank you.

2031
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,220
Thank you.

2032
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,040
Give me money to my favorite consumers.

2033
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:43,700
As usual.

2034
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,100
Thank you for doing what you do, Doki.

2035
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:45,660
You're so cool.

2036
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:46,360
Thank you.

2037
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,620
Thank you for the super chat.

2038
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:47,960
Thank you.

2039
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,520
Thank you.

2040
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,760
I really appreciate it.

2041
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,040
Uh... AKB.

2042
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,100
Thank you for the super chat.

2043
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:52,420
Thank you.

2044
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:52,880
Thank you.

2045
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,400
College before AI.

2046
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,560
Okay.

2047
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,220
Unk.

2048
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:56,640
Hey.

2049
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,240
At least I can read a book.

2050
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,960
At least I have to highlight.

2051
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:08,780
I have to use highlighters.

2052
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,340
And I can read a book.

2053
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,820
I lost my... No, when you become a streamer...

2054
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,100
When you become a streamer, you lost... You lose... You lose... You have to trade in, like, certain skill set.

2055
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:26,140
It's like... It's like a deal with the devil at the crossroads.

2056
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:30,420
But instead of that, it's like... You gotta trade in... You know how... It's like during, like...

2057
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,400
When you're creating character.

2058
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,240
And you have to, like, minus stats.

2059
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,100
And then buff other stats and stuff.

2060
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,080
I took away my reading stat.

2061
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,100
And then put on, like...

2062
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:39,500
Uh...

2063
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,900
Put it on everything else.

2064
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,440
I was like, I don't need that.

2065
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,840
I reset my skill points.

2066
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,120
Yeah.

2067
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,540
I became a streamer.

2068
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:48,920
Reset my skill points.

2069
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:49,660
And was like...

2070
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,940
And then, like, put it all on... On, like, other stuff.

2071
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:53,560
I...

2072
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,480
Intelligence in one.

2073
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,700
And in everything... I min-max everything else.

2074
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,900
I respect myself.

2075
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,000
I...

2076
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,500
More brain... Exactly.

2077
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,940
More brain rot.

2078
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,440
More charisma.

2079
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,020
And then zero on intelligence.

2080
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,140
We don't need magic.

2081
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,380
We don't need magic.

2082
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,620
We brute force our way in.

2083
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,780
Like, 100 speech.

2084
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,700
100... Speech 100.

2085
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,440
That's right.

2086
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,700
Ungabunga time.

2087
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,500
Speech 100.

2088
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,100
But yeah, that's an interesting article.

2089
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,920
I just...

2090
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,520
Just wanted to say that.

2091
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2092
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,980
Ha ha ha ha.

2093
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,620
Ha ha ha.

2094
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:45,700
Ha ha ha.

2095
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,120
Ha ha ha ha.

2096
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,270
Ha ha ha ha.

2097
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:50,630
Um...

2098
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:51,610
What was I gonna say?

2099
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,230
How did I...

2100
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:53,790
Oh my gosh.

2101
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:54,630
Oh yeah.

2102
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:55,350
Hey.

2103
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,390
Oh wait.

2104
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,150
Rice, thank you for the 10 gifted.

2105
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:00,150
Ships, thank you.

2106
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:00,870
Thank you.

2107
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,270
I really appreciate it.

2108
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:02,870
Thank you.

2109
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,930
Beeps, thank you for the super chat.

2110
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:05,210
Thank you.

2111
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:05,810
Thank you.

2112
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,610
I used floppy disk in college.

2113
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:09,490
Don't remind me.

2114
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:10,170
Oh yeah.

2115
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:11,630
That must have been hell.

2116
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,070
Because like, how many...

2117
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:15,090
How much memory do you have in floppy disk anyway?

2118
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,030
That's crazy to think about.

2119
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,990
Because that shit can't store a lot of...

2120
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,810
That shit can't store a lot of memory.

2121
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:25,550
I remember like, if you show like, there was a video.

2122
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:30,270
1.44 megabytes.

2123
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:31,130
Jesus Christ.

2124
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:33,450
I remember there was a video.

2125
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,970
Where they showed like...

2126
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:36,770
Um...

2127
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:37,350
Gen Z.

2128
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:38,690
Was it Gen Z or Gen...

2129
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,030
Okay.

2130
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:39,890
Gen A.

2131
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,150
Gen A.

2132
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:42,610
I think...

2133
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:42,890
Okay.

2134
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,510
What ages are in Gen A?

2135
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,010
I remember if you showed like...

2136
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,210
They showed like...

2137
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,670
Um...

2138
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:52,490
Like...

2139
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:53,450
Stuff like...

2140
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:54,890
Like stuff like floppy disk.

2141
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,050
And...

2142
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:57,210
Um...

2143
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:57,790
And...

2144
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:59,290
What other stuff did they show them?

2145
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:00,950
I remember floppy disk was one of them.

2146
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,310
And they showed them that.

2147
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,710
And they're like...

2148
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:04,090
What do you think these things are?

2149
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,250
And the kids were like...

2150
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,010
Were like...

2151
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:07,710
I don't know.

2152
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:15,250
Gen A shown...

2153
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,930
All the technology.

2154
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,090
And they're like...

2155
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:19,410
Oh...

2156
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,670
What do you mean you don't know?

2157
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:23,410
Oh yeah.

2158
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,110
They're like...

2159
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,370
It's a save icon.

2160
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:26,030
Yeah.

2161
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:26,390
Yeah.

2162
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:26,950
Yeah.

2163
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:27,770
That was it.

2164
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:28,730
I remembered.

2165
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,090
They were shown...

2166
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,130
They were shown like the floppy disk.

2167
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:33,030
And they're like...

2168
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:34,450
That's the save icon.

2169
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,410
So they don't know it was a floppy disk.

2170
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:38,010
Wait.

2171
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:38,990
Floppy disk...

2172
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,230
Why is...

2173
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:46,750
Okay.

2174
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:48,030
Um...

2175
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:48,390
Oh my god.

2176
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,930
I wish I could find that video again.

2177
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:50,910
That was so...

2178
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:55,610
Uh...

2179
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:58,310
Kids shown floppy disk.

2180
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,660
Oh my god.

2181
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,580
Kids...

2182
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,760
Kids guess what I've...

2183
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,640
Oh, is this video?

2184
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:06,560
Oh wait.

2185
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,720
I need to turn off my...

2186
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,620
My music.

2187
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,440
So I can see if it is.

2188
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,320
It might be from outer space.

2189
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,240
Excuse me?

2190
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,500
The kid is like...

2191
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,240
It might be from outer space.

2192
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,120
What do you mean by that, child?

2193
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,480
Why do you think it's from outer space?

2194
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:27,860
Wait.

2195
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,620
Where's my...

2196
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:28,760
Wait.

2197
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:29,820
How...

2198
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,840
When...

2199
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,060
Wait.

2200
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,560
Did the BGM stop?

2201
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,540
When did the BGM stop?

2202
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,640
When did the BGM...

2203
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,320
Oh, silly child.

2204
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:43,140
Unknown techno.

2205
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,480
How long have I been ta...

2206
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,300
A while ago?

2207
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,080
Oh, guys.

2208
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,680
How long have I been talking with no music, guys?

2209
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,060
Um...

2210
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,080
A while...

2211
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:55,260
A while...

2212
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:55,660
It last...

2213
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,280
Whoops.

2214
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,380
I think I accidentally closed...

2215
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,480
I think I definitely...

2216
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:00,980
Accidentally...

2217
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,280
Uh...

2218
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,300
Closed...

2219
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:05,880
Uh...

2220
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,560
Uh...

2221
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,440
My BGM during all of this.

2222
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,120
And I don't remember when.

2223
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,460
I don't remember when I...

2224
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,260
I closed my BGM.

2225
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,320
I was just...

2226
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,900
I was so...

2227
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,680
Passionate about everything I was yapping about.

2228
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,220
That I forgot...

2229
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,240
There was no BGM.

2230
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:25,460
Okay.

2231
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:28,260
Kids...

2232
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,520
Floppy...

2233
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,000
Disc.

2234
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:30,700
Oh my god.

2235
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,440
It was such a funny video, too.

2236
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,480
I wish I remember...

2237
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,420
Uh...

2238
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,480
I wish I remember, like...

2239
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:40,980
What...

2240
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,080
What video it was.

2241
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,080
I was like...

2242
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:43,340
It's like...

2243
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,920
It might be from outer space.

2244
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,000
It might be from outer space.

2245
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,280
CD player?

2246
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,600
They actually call it a CD player?

2247
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,100
Oh my god.

2248
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,560
Okay.

2249
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,900
I found this video and I thought that was funny.

2250
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:02,780
This one.

2251
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,980
There's no way.

2252
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,280
These kids are not...

2253
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,740
This was not even...

2254
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,080
This was 2018.

2255
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:12,020
They called it a fridge magnet?

2256
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,960
A SIM card?

2257
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,840
It's a CD?

2258
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,080
Someone's like...

2259
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:24,740
It's a CD?

2260
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,840
They're like...

2261
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:31,780
Um...

2262
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,020
How old was it?

2263
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,500
And you're like...

2264
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,520
Probably the 70s or 80s.

2265
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,440
And then their kid was like...

2266
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,460
The 40s?

2267
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,260
Not the fridge magnet.

2268
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:52,810
Bro, one of the child said...

2269
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,750
Is this from the Victorian era?

2270
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:56,030
Like...

2271
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,710
Bro...

2272
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,570
Someone told my guy...

2273
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,570
The Victorian...

2274
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:04,770
What?

2275
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,630
Victorian era...

2276
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:08,790
Floppy disk.

2277
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,450
They're rage-baiting.

2278
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:14,910
That child is rage-baiting me.

2279
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,870
And I'm gonna take that bait.

2280
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:19,110
Om, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2281
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,310
I'm mad now.

2282
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:29,770
That child is rage-baiting me.

2283
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:33,170
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

2284
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,670
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

2285
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:39,610
Are we getting rage-baited by the child?

2286
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:42,790
Also...

2287
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:47,790
I realized, did I actually play any Twitter videos while I was trying to look through Twitter?

2288
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,290
Was there like random sounds playing through?

2289
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,290
Because like, I had... I didn't... Okay, no.

2290
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,290
Okay, that's good.

2291
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:59,930
Because like, um... I didn't realize... Okay, that's good though.

2292
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:00,310
Yes?

2293
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,690
Okay, I heard one random sound.

2294
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,650
Okay, that's good.

2295
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:05,790
Like...

2296
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:16,630
From one thing... Okay, I don't know what that one thing was.

2297
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,970
I don't know, but yes.

2298
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:23,290
No, I just... Because I had like... I was looking through Twitter and some videos were playing.

2299
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:26,350
So like, I don't... Because you know, like some videos...

2300
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,410
Some videos would autoplay when you scroll down.

2301
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:34,050
So like... That's why I was like, oh shit, it was...

2302
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:36,110
It was a random boop sound.

2303
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:36,970
Okay, that's good.

2304
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,610
Because I didn't know what sound was playing.

2305
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:44,770
Because I had my... When I talked... When I had BGM... I didn't... The reason why...

2306
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:47,790
I have BGM playing...

2307
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:53,770
The reason... I mean, the reason why I don't hear anything when I have BGM playing, And I don't know when the BGM stops.

2308
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:56,990
Is because I actually mute on my end.

2309
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,510
Of... Like, because I have a... You know, I have a mixer.

2310
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:04,270
So I mute it on my end, because when I'm talking, I get very distracted hearing music while I talk.

2311
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:10,110
So I don't realize when the BGM is muted because of that.

2312
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:15,710
So like, I only turn it on so you guys can hear what I'm... you guys can have like little BGM going on.

2313
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:19,910
But when I'm talking, I get distracted when I hear music playing, because it...

2314
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:22,710
like, my train of thought gets distracted.

2315
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,710
No, I muted it.

2316
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:25,950
I muted it when I was looking through the videos and stuff.

2317
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:32,770
So that's why I noticed really late that the BGM stopped anyway.

2318
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:39,310
Mister Broken класс, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2319
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:43,690
I bet that kid doesn't even know when the Victoria era even happened.

2320
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,630
Mister Stan, thank you for the super chat.

2321
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:46,930
Thank you.

2322
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:52,570
Thank you.ம Welcome you've got mail.

2323
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:53,830
You're the super chat butt, thank you.

2324
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,410
Thank you.

2325
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,110
Alright, let's think of the super chat.

2326
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:56,450
Thank you.

2327
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:57,090
Thank you.

2328
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:02,990
There was one JP tweet I saw that said it looked like a vending machine.

2329
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:05,150
And I've never looked at it same since.

2330
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:06,790
Wait, does it actually?

2331
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,490
Floppy disk.

2332
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:11,410
I've never seen it like that.

2333
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:12,750
Floppy disk.

2334
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,090
Icon.

2335
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:21,740
Oh, it does!

2336
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,380
It looks like a clip art.

2337
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:26,520
Wait, if you look at a clip art, it does look like it.

2338
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,040
Fiction, thank you to the super chat.

2339
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,280
Thank you.

2340
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:28,660
Thank you.

2341
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,260
I wish we had super chat reading segments at the end of your stream.

2342
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:35,220
Like, if you do see this, will you play Gears of War?

2343
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,800
I'm pretty sure I've talked about this before.

2344
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,620
I'm pretty sure.

2345
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,320
I said, like, that's, like, a game I've always wanted to try.

2346
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,060
I remember talking about it before.

2347
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,040
But thank you to the super chat.

2348
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:47,360
Thank you.

2349
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:47,880
Thank you.

2350
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,600
I've talked about how I've always wanted to try Gears of War.

2351
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,400
Because, um...

2352
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:52,640
Yeah.

2353
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,080
And, um...

2354
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:00,700
And that like, my dad loved Gears of War and I watched him play from 1 to 3.

2355
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:01,980
Wait, did it go to 3?

2356
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:02,620
I don't remember.

2357
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,480
It's been a series.

2358
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,460
So yeah.

2359
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,020
Gears of War.

2360
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:07,900
Yeah.

2361
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:10,500
Yeah, and I watched him.

2362
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,600
Oh wait, they have a 4.

2363
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,060
I heard 4 was really bad.

2364
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,220
Was 4 bad, right?

2365
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:16,560
4 was really bad, right?

2366
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,360
Or was it really good?

2367
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,340
I remember it was... it went up to 5?

2368
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,820
Wait, there's 5?

2369
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:24,980
5 Gears of War?

2370
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,300
4 doesn't exist.

2371
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,520
But yeah, I remember talking about it before.

2372
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:42,020
And the reason why I don't do super chat reading at the end of streams anymore is that...

2373
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:52,540
The last couple of months, my... I've been... Also, within the last year, I've been really sick within the last year.

2374
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:58,140
So I don't... I can't do super chat reading segments anymore.

2375
01:31:58,540 --> 01:31:59,380
Not anymore.

2376
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,860
But like, I've been like, continuously sick.

2377
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,340
And that's been like, really harsh on my throat a lot.

2378
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:10,620
And so like, every time after the stream, I have to like, rest my voice.

2379
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,740
And that's why we haven't had super chat readings for a long time.

2380
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,720
But to make up for it, I usually try to...

2381
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,820
Well, not for super chat readings.

2382
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,460
But I usually chat a lot in the beginning of the stream.

2383
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,120
And then like, go into it.

2384
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:27,620
Because, you know, my throat is like, much stronger in the beginning of the stream.

2385
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,960
And that lets me like, you know, talk to you guys for a while.

2386
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,120
And...

2387
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:38,160
And able to like, interact with you guys more before we get into the talk...

2388
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,300
Into the game and stuff.

2389
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,960
But I do... I remember saying it before, but...

2390
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,440
One day, I'll be bringing it back.

2391
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,200
When I'm... Because I'm still sick.

2392
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,440
If you guys didn't know, I'm actually still sick.

2393
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,320
Uh, I haven't fully recovered yet.

2394
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,080
Um...

2395
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:53,720
And...

2396
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,140
Um...

2397
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:58,040
I'm still trying to like, you know, recover from all of it.

2398
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,580
Uh...

2399
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:01,980
Because I remember when I brought...

2400
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,400
I remember what one or...

2401
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,960
For one week, I brought back super chat readings at the end of the stream.

2402
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,360
For one week.

2403
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,060
And then I got sick again.

2404
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,400
Like...

2405
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,220
Is that...

2406
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,740
Is that fucked up?

2407
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:19,240
I brought it back for one week and then I got sick again.

2408
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:19,900
Yeah.

2409
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,510
Was there one...

2410
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:27,150
I don't even remember.

2411
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,210
There was like one or two...

2412
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,610
Maybe it was like one or two streams.

2413
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,710
I did it for one or two streams and I got...

2414
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:32,370
My body...

2415
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:33,910
Immune system fucked up.

2416
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:36,730
Um...

2417
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:40,210
Um...

2418
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:41,330
Let's see.

2419
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:44,370
Uh...

2420
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:45,790
Koyuki, thank you for the super chat.

2421
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:46,490
Thank you, thank you.

2422
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:48,010
Kira, thank you for the super chat.

2423
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:48,990
Thank you, thank you.

2424
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:49,090
Thank you.

2425
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:50,530
Uh...

2426
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:52,590
No, I think it's cause like...

2427
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:53,150
Uh...

2428
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:56,050
Like, yeah, it's just, I think it's also stress.

2429
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:59,210
I read that stress can make your immune system a lot weaker.

2430
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:06,070
And obviously, I had a really, like, a year where I've been, like, really stressed out and lots of stuff has been happening.

2431
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,730
So obviously, my immune system is a lot weaker.

2432
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:13,150
It also didn't help that Canadian doctors were so hard to reach.

2433
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:27,730
And for the longest time, I have a family doctor now, but I didn't go here for this last sickness just because it was more or less, it was like, not as bad, because, like, I didn't have, like, the coughing thing.

2434
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:34,230
And that was the only reason why I didn't go to the doctor this time, because I didn't have the coughing thing going on, which is why, like...

2435
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:37,330
But the last time I got really sick, I was coughing for a long time.

2436
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:41,810
But yeah, I have a family doctor now, so everything is A-OK.

2437
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:42,930
Hey, guys!

2438
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:56,390
I'm gonna use that topic to end it, because speaking of throat health, I realized how long I've been streaming for, so I'm gonna call it for today, um, so I can finally rest my throat.

2439
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:02,910
Um, because, uh, we had a lot of very long streams the last three days, so I think this is a good stopping point.

2440
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:06,570
Uh, because I'm like, speaking of health, I guess it's time to rest.

2441
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,370
Ha ha ha!

2442
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:10,150
But, a lovely chat with all you guys.

2443
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:15,130
I hope you guys have a good night, or a good morning, depending on where you guys are, or a good afternoon.

2444
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:16,470
And we guys rest well.

2445
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:18,450
Um, it's always great chatting with you guys.

2446
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,390
Always have a fun time chatting with my dragoons.

2447
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:26,470
And as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2448
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:30,110
And if you, stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2449
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:32,090
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2450
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:35,250
Don't worry, you are all forgiven for your sins today.

2451
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,350
Um, anyway, bye-bye, everybody!

2452
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,510
Bye!

2453
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,860
Wait, I just, wait, I just read the super chat.

2454
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,360
Many sins are not forgiven.

2455
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,540
He's the only one.

2456
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:12,200
Bye, guys!
