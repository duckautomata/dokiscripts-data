1
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,800
Sorry, we were waiting on Mint.

2
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,460
She had to put on a space suit.

3
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,540
Oh yeah, it was all me.

4
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,740
Yeah, it was all Mint.

5
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,180
I have my space suit on!

6
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,660
Yeah, while we were waiting, uh, Nimue sent us a very, uh...

7
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,280
Hey, it was from the theme page.

8
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Why on the theme page?

9
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,460
Oh, I see what's happening in that picture.

10
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,960
I just was focused on...

11
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,940
I didn't even see it.

12
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,660
Oh...

13
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Like, I was like, I didn't... Oh...

14
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,220
I see, I see.

15
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
It's that kind of game, huh?

16
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,580
Yeah, it's that kind of game.

17
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
It's gonna help a brother out, you know?

18
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,180
We'll see if that happens to any of us.

19
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,440
Yeah.

20
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,580
What a way to go, you know?

21
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
What a way to die.

22
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,380
This is some people's real fantasy, though.

23
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,040
Yay!

24
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,540
Honestly, it is.

25
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,920
Wait, where did you find this?

26
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,980
On the Steam page?

27
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,220
Yeah, it's on... No, it's on the...

28
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,520
It's on the official Steam page for the game.

29
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:16,960
Oh yeah, but...

30
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,080
You guys are wondering...

31
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,200
What?

32
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,060
I'll show.

33
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,920
Yeah, I'll show.

34
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,540
I'll show too.

35
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll show too.

36
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
I'll put it on the screen for the...

37
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,760
This is for the class.

38
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,280
Here you go, everybody.

39
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,640
Why don't you share the cluster to the class?

40
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,400
Nimi?

41
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,100
Why don't you...

42
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh gosh, I'm sharing it.

43
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,400
I... I take no responsibility for this image.

44
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,380
This was...

45
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,680
This was posted for everyone to see on the Steam page.

46
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
It was out in the public.

47
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,000
It was out in the public.

48
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,960
This is why Doki chose this game.

49
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,680
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,560
I saw this...

51
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,400
I saw that...

52
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,720
That specific image.

53
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,880
I was like, damn.

54
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,680
The perfect game.

55
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,740
What?

56
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't know why...

57
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
I wonder why he died.

58
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:58,780
Yeah!

59
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,320
Weak, that's all I'll say.

60
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,700
Weak!

61
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,020
Hello everybody!

62
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,160
Welcome to...

63
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,700
The green-yellow collab.

64
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,380
Yay!

65
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,640
Let's go green!

66
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,880
Yeah, let's go green!

67
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,100
Let's go yellow!

68
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,100
We all have a little bit of green on us.

69
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,500
Yeah, and we all have a little bit of yellow on us, too.

70
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,440
Wait, that's true.

71
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

72
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,620
Yeah.

73
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,360
We're really actually cohesive.

74
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,660
Oh, yeah, we are.

75
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,040
The green-yellow-woman collab.

76
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,540
The lobby close.

77
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,580
Wait, no, we're all still here.

78
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,540
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

79
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,100
Oh, yeah, come back to us.

80
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,160
Come back, come back to space.

81
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
She landed back on Earth.

82
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,160
She had... I got ejected.

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,860
I got voted out.

84
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,480
Yeah, you got voted out.

85
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Oh, no.

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Gotta do your task.

87
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah, someone was not doing their task.

88
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,940
Why didn't you fix the lights when it was off, Doobie?

89
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,700
Sorry.

90
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm busy looking at an image, really.

91
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,080
She passed one.

92
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
She got ejected.

93
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,040
Yeah.

94
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,500
I think that makes Nimi the most size.

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,020
Oh, that's true.

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,380
Don't vote me out.

97
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,180
I don't know what I'm doing.

98
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,360
I've never played the game before.

99
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,300
None of us have played the game before.

100
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
Excuses, excuses.

101
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,960
Yeah, none of us have played the game before.

102
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,280
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Yeah, do we know what kind of game this is?

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,500
It's basically... Actually, no.

105
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,680
I mean, it's like one of those proximity chats for co-op games, right?

106
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,280
Yeah, it's a proximity chat for co-op games, right?

107
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,600
Yeah, it's a proximity chat.

108
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,100
You know what's funny?

109
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,780
I suggested the game, too.

110
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,100
I was like, um...

111
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,700
No.

112
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,300
I just know we're exploring the moon.

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,900
It's like...

114
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,400
We're trying... Oh, wait, no.

115
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,940
We're trying to find the moon.

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,700
And return alive.

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,900
So it's like a friend's loss.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,760
Trying to find the moon?

119
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,720
Yeah.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,760
We lost the moon?

121
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,240
Oh, yeah.

122
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,500
It did say something like that.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,560
You have to find the moon.

124
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,220
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,660
I don't...

126
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,020
Oh.

127
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,260
How could... Oh, my gosh.

128
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,020
Gru did it.

129
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,340
He fucking did it.

130
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,820
He stole the moon and we're trying to find it back.

131
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,540
We're just little minions.

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,240
My scheme is offline.

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,920
I gotta fix it.

134
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,480
Oh, my God.

135
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:27,680
Wait.

136
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,480
Oh, no.

137
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,140
Take your time.

138
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,000
But it's not Tuesday.

139
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,580
Oh.

140
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,700
Is it Tuesday?

141
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,460
I've already lost.

142
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,040
No, it's not.

143
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,300
Okay.

144
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,500
It's definitely Friday.

145
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,560
Happy Friday.

146
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,100
Yay.

147
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,580
Happy Friday, everybody.

148
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,140
Happy Friday, everyone.

149
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,580
Happy Friday.

150
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,080
Also, Soundgat, my...

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,900
For people who are, like, wondering about the sound, we're gonna be using the in-game VC.

152
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,940
But, like, the lobby VC is so quiet.

153
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,980
Yeah, we gotta, like, get in-game and kind of fix it.

154
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,760
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,480
But we sound like we're in space, though.

156
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,500
That's the best part.

157
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,920
We sound like we're actually in our little spacesuits.

158
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,100
Sounds like Xbox mic.

159
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,860
It really is.

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,460
I'm gonna get on there.

161
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm gonna be, like, a ten-year-old.

162
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,580
I'm gonna cuss you out.

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,400
No, be like, John Madden.

164
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,100
John.

165
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
You say, you freaking...

166
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,380
You freaking dummy.

167
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,720
All right.

168
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,520
You're gonna get banned for that kind of language.

169
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Oh, that's true.

170
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:24,980
I will.

171
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,620
I'll report you.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,500
David's looking right now.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Oh, no.

174
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,340
John Madden.

175
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,280
It's like 15 plus years old.

176
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,820
And it's still funny.

177
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,240
It's still got it.

178
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,760
It's still got it.

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
Every, like, couple of months, I think about it.

180
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,280
Oh, no.

181
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,740
All right.

182
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,600
Uh, do...

183
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:53,920
Oh, wait.

184
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,560
Is it Steam still down for you, Doobie?

185
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,780
Um, it was up.

186
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,020
Like, I closed it and then I relaunched it and then I connected.

187
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,360
But now I'm disconnected again.

188
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Oh, no.

189
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,880
Oh, that's not good.

190
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:04,960
Hold on.

191
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,480
Oh, it was working.

192
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:06,940
Sorry.

193
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,940
It's okay.

194
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,360
It's okay.

195
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,480
It's okay.

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,700
It's all right.

197
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,280
We're bonding.

198
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,960
We're having a bonding session before we betray each other in space.

199
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,080
There's no rules in space, Batman.

200
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,940
Is PvP enabled?

201
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,320
Is PvP a thing?

202
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,500
I know.

203
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,280
I was like, is it even a thing?

204
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,700
I don't know.

205
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,380
I mean, can we fight the monsters or no?

206
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820
I mean, I hope so.

207
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,120
We can with our mouth.

208
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,180
I mean, with words.

209
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,200
We're in worrying.

210
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,480
We're the words.

211
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,240
We're the words.

212
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,740
We're the words.

213
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:42,840
We're the words.

214
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
That's what she means.

215
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,380
We'll just...

216
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,080
We'll say very mean words to them and they'll go away.

217
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
Sticks and stones.

218
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,460
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,680
Isn't it probably like the opposite?

220
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,460
Like, it'll sense when you talk or something and then we'll fight.

221
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,100
Oh, yeah.

222
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,520
Probably.

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,500
They'll fight us.

224
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,180
Apparently, this game is made by one person.

225
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,460
We can attribute everything to them.

226
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,520
Yeah, that's true.

227
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,880
She made it.

228
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,820
I'm in.

229
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,420
Oh my god.

230
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,720
All right, I'll start the lobby.

231
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,760
Okay.

232
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,420
Wait, should we mute everybody then?

233
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,940
Oh, I forgot.

234
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,880
She didn't choose her color.

235
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,100
All right, she's white now.

236
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,400
Okay.

237
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,180
I'm white.

238
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,620
Yay!

239
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,800
Okay, I'm gonna...

240
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,080
Wait, we turn everybody to zero.

241
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, we turn everyone to zero in this grid.

242
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,500
All right.

243
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,280
Okay, bye-bye.

244
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,860
Bye-bye.

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,600
All right.

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,100
Hello?

247
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,040
All right, I'm gonna turn...

248
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,380
I'm gonna fix the audio.

249
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,620
Hello?

250
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,480
Hello?

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm gonna turn my mic up.

252
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,400
It's pretty quiet.

253
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,520
Okay, my mic up is up.

254
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,780
Is it up for you guys?

255
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,820
A little bit.

256
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,360
A little better.

257
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,720
All right, it's at 250.

258
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,380
250.

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,760
Okay, I'll put mine at 250.

260
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,500
Yeah.

261
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,200
That's the max.

262
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,040
Hello?

263
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:08,800
Hello?

264
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,420
Hello?

265
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:10,960
Are you too loud?

266
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,300
No, louder.

267
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:12,840
250.

268
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,880
Put it at 250.

269
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,120
I said 250.

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,780
I put it at 250.

271
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,760
Oh my god.

272
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,140
250.

273
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,640
It was...

274
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,880
It did improve for the others, but...

275
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,820
Yours is still a little quiet, Doobie.

276
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,320
Wait, Nimmi, can you try talking?

277
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,160
Hello?

278
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,460
Komakuwa.

279
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,940
All right, I'm gonna turn...

280
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,420
The other stuff up.

281
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,000
It's gonna be so quiet.

282
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,620
Maybe we turn the game, like, volume up.

283
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,600
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

284
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm doing that right now.

285
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,230
I'm turning the game.

286
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,310
Yeah.

287
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,910
Everything's gonna be really loud.

288
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,010
I turned the game...

289
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,390
Oh wait, I'm gonna turn the game...

290
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,410
Other game stuff lower.

291
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,430
How do you do that, though?

292
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,970
Yeah, is there other games though?

293
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,330
I think...

294
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:54,950
Oh my god!

295
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,390
Oh, Toby, you did it!

296
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,830
Did you fix it?

297
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,050
But you fixed it!

298
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,110
You fixed it!

299
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,030
Oh my god.

300
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,830
No, you're like...

302
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,650
I think...

303
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,110
Your microphone...

304
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,590
Should I turn it down?

305
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,690
No, it's...

306
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,730
It's...

307
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,870
It's like peaking, so like, it's like...

308
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,250
I hear like 5th, we...

309
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,730
Wait, it doesn't peak for us, but your setup is peaking and like, we can only hear like...

310
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,010
Okay, I think it's the master volume.

311
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,070
You turn down the master volume, and that's the game.

312
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,150
The game is master.

313
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,310
It's not...

314
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,040
No, it does.

315
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,720
Oh, does it?

316
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, it does!

317
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,040
Never mind, it does.

318
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,780
I just turned...

319
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,520
Yeah, I turned it back up.

320
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,120
I just turned it back up.

321
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,320
Well, doobie, how did you fix it on your end?

322
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,960
What did you do?

323
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,820
Oh, I just turned it back up.

324
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,440
Oh, I just turned it back up.

325
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,360
Is it still on the back?

326
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,200
It's still so loud.

327
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,060
It's still so loud.

328
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,440
Oh.

329
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Hold on.

330
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,320
Luckily...

331
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,480
Luckily, we're all streaming our POVs.

332
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,300
Yeah, let me...

333
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,600
Okay, okay.

334
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,200
Someone will combine it, I guess.

335
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,380
Someone will sync up all our audios together.

336
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,000
Quite the worst campaign.

337
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,440
The ultimate compilation.

338
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,680
Like, I don't understand.

339
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,360
Why is there no individual toggles?

340
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,840
It's just...

341
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,440
It's just...

342
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,180
Okay.

343
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,220
Okay.

344
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,060
It really feels like we're in space, guys.

345
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,920
I don't think we're in space, though.

346
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,000
Wait, this is a parking lot.

347
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,540
Why are we in the parking lot?

348
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,440
I can't crouch.

349
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,860
I can't crouch.

350
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,880
Okay, it's...

351
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,120
Oh, yeah.

352
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,800
See, it's crouch.

353
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,880
Wait, how do we get...

354
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,340
Oh my god.

355
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,540
Wait, how are you dancing?

356
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,070
Yeah, how do you dance?

357
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,890
Hold G.

358
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,490
G?

359
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,450
Oh, I see.

360
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:10,890
Oh, I see.

361
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,690
What's this?

362
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,130
Ho!

363
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,110
Whoa!

364
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,810
Whoa, Doobie!

365
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,230
She's dooping out!

366
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:21,870
Wait, Doobie!

367
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,990
Wait, it's not for Doobie!

368
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,790
Wait, what's happening, Doobie?

369
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,230
Hello!

370
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,870
You're just saying hi.

371
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,830
Wait, I go over there.

372
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,250
We're just do...

373
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,330
Wow, guys, I didn't know space was just a parking lot.

374
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,270
I...

375
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,870
I...

376
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,670
Oh, you have a creepy van, too.

377
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,650
Oh my gosh.

378
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,370
Oh, what are we trying to do?

379
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,150
What?

380
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,830
You saw the image.

381
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,350
I don't know what we're trying to do.

382
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,430
I can't.

383
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,650
All right, where do we go?

384
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,510
So we have equipment.

385
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,570
Can we go inside?

386
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,170
We're supposed to turn on electricity on the right floor.

387
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,710
Oh, right here.

388
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,730
Oh my god, it's Phasmo.

389
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,690
Wait, let me turn down my sensitivity.

390
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,490
Okay.

391
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,570
Oh, it's echo in here.

392
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:20,650
There.

393
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,030
Oh.

394
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,450
The words that can be interacted with are highlighted with a faint light.

395
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,170
That's good to know.

396
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,170
Oh, there's a special book.

397
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,950
What's this?

398
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,030
I don't know how to read.

399
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,630
Someone else read the special book number one.

400
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,770
What does it say?

401
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,230
What does it say, Mint?

402
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,690
Hello?

403
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,710
Hello?

404
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:50,910
Mint?

405
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,330
Mint, are you okay?

406
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,370
Mint?

407
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,970
Doobie?

408
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,310
You stop talking.

409
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:56,670
I think I'm possessed.

410
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,010
Mint, Doobie, you're not talking.

411
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,950
Wait, does it limit us when we're...

412
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:08,450
We entered the building and we're like in our own little like inner dimension.

413
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,750
The pocket dimension where we can only hear one of the...

414
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,910
Oh no, the yellow and green.

415
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,630
The yellow and greens.

416
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,630
The swap.

417
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,870
It's like, you know, it's like wife swap.

418
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,370
We swapped the greens.

419
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,270
Okay.

420
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:33,990
It's okay.

421
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,070
We can do this.

422
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,490
Yeah.

423
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,410
We can do this together.

424
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,930
We just...

425
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,030
Whoa!

426
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:40,610
What?

427
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,130
There's a kitten.

428
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:41,830
Oh my god.

429
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,910
What the fuck is this?

430
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,110
Is it alive?

431
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,790
I don't know.

432
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,910
It's a giant ass cat.

433
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,050
I'm very lucky.

434
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,930
I know.

435
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,410
Hello little guy.

436
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,050
Okay, we gotta find the power.

437
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,450
All right.

438
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:57,910
All right.

439
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,910
I hope Mint and Doobie can work together.

440
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,050
And then Nimi and I, we can do this.

441
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,730
It's gonna figure out where.

442
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,190
Oh, we gotta figure out.

443
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,410
What was that?

444
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,110
Oh!

445
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:11,710
Oh!

446
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,030
Oh!

447
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,110
Oh!

448
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh wait!

449
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,490
Oh, wait.

450
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,030
I can hear!

451
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,090
I can hear you.

452
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,650
It jump scared me and it be able to hear you guys.

453
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,570
I can...

454
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,470
I can hear you.

455
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,730
Wait?

456
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,270
You hear me?

457
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,290
Yeah, I can hear you.

458
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,510
I can hear...

459
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,110
I got jumped...

460
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,670
It jump scared my game.

461
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,950
Is it hearing you guys?

462
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,070
Wait.

463
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,350
Apparently we just clicked V on accident.

464
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,050
Ah!

465
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,470
I saw you muted yourself.

466
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,230
Yeah.

467
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,130
You just muted me.

468
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,810
Why didn't you guys press me?

469
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,230
Why?

470
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,930
Because we were probably trying to find a cool emo or something.

471
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,690
Yeah, we were probably trying to press G.

472
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,450
Whoa.

473
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,170
Okay, anyway, there was an alien outside that window.

474
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,610
Oh, we heard it.

475
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,390
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,130
It was really loud.

477
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,650
I'm scared.

478
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,070
I got a TV.

479
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,450
Oh, nice!

480
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,750
What's on the TV?

481
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,090
Um, it says, uh, no signal.

482
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,030
Oh, okay, we got a person.

483
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,150
Wait, this looks like electricity.

484
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,450
Oh, wait, yeah.

485
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

486
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,490
Okay, turn that on.

487
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,710
Nice.

488
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,050
We did the first task.

489
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,430
Wait, the cat.

490
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,030
The cat?

491
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,590
Oh, the cat?

492
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,090
Oh, no.

493
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,090
The cat's still sleeping.

494
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,290
Guys, I don't think there's a space.

495
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,410
I don't think...

496
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,070
What's the transmitter doing?

497
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,670
Why is the moon in the...

498
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,150
Like...

499
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,210
Like, I... Oh, we have to find the moon, right?

500
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,010
Oh, yeah, we have to find the moon, yeah.

501
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,850
Wait, maybe we're gonna build a rocket.

502
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,070
Oh, yeah.

503
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:41,290
Oh, yeah.

504
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,310
Okay.

505
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,250
Well, we're on the first floor, so we gotta go downstairs.

506
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:46,790
It's locked.

507
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,790
Close on the other side.

508
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,770
Oh, down here?

509
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:51,690
Hello.

510
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,610
Is the sensitivity weird for anybody else?

511
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,110
It's a dead end.

512
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,950
Oh, um, just do the controls.

513
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,710
It's on controls.

514
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,590
Yeah, I turned mine down.

515
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:58,590
Is it?

516
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,510
Yeah, I turned mine down.

517
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,810
Yeah.

518
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,070
Okay, I'm gonna turn mine down.

519
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,830
Fucking, my chat's like, um, it's actually, Earth is also in space, so...

520
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,150
Oh, true.

521
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,250
True.

522
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,310
That's true.

523
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,050
Brain chat.

524
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,710
We're just LARPing.

525
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,210
Close on the other side.

526
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,470
Oh, there's more over here.

527
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,250
We kind of are, like, we put on our spaces already.

528
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,210
Yeah, we're like these kids that are, like, um...

529
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,390
The save game.

530
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,470
Oh, we're here, we're here.

531
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,990
Oh, the game has been saved.

532
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,850
Oh, this has to be the basement.

533
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,790
Doesn't have to be.

534
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,990
Oh, look at that.

535
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,690
Oh, that's us!

536
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:41,870
It's us.

537
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,990
Oh, we can change the color.

538
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,490
Doobie, you don't have to be white anymore.

539
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,170
Oh, nice.

540
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,330
Okay, I'll be blue.

541
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,690
Blue!

542
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,070
That's a different blue than mince blue, right?

543
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,310
Yeah, yeah, it is, it is.

544
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:54,930
Yeah, yeah.

545
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,070
Oh, that's cute.

546
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,670
What's this?

547
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,190
Oh, we have... Oh, get previously researched items.

548
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:03,850
Current distance.

549
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:04,350
Oh, wait.

550
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,690
Is this the book that we...

551
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,470
Current objective is displayed in the corner.

552
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,130
Yeah, I don't know.

553
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,170
Close on the other side.

554
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,370
How do we get out...

555
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,270
Out of here?

556
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,430
Ooh.

557
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,830
Okay, the last time I was alone, something happened.

558
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,170
I like how...

559
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,410
Like, it's like, we're in like a little suburban area.

560
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,410
Yeah, I'll see...

561
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,630
Yeah.

562
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,210
We're gonna swear to school or something, right?

563
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,250
Yeah, we're...

564
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,090
Scary out there, though?

565
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,910
Do you see that?

566
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,390
What?

567
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,130
See what?

568
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,530
By that building over there?

569
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,150
What?

570
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,170
I don't see anything.

571
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,950
I don't see anything.

572
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,810
Are you sure any...

573
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,750
Did you take your meds, Nimi?

574
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:40,890
Nimi?

575
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,250
Yeah.

576
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,750
I swear I see it.

577
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm by the building.

578
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,310
Nimi, that's just a regular kid.

579
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,110
That's just...

580
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,070
There's a kid?

581
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,890
That's...

582
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,130
No, yeah.

583
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,530
You guys not see that kid over there?

584
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,210
That's not a kid.

585
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,490
Yeah, there's a regular...

586
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,330
There's a kid out there.

587
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,130
Do you not see it?

588
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,030
Is this guy in the corner?

589
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,290
Yeah, there's a kid.

590
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,570
It's like 12 feet tall.

591
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,570
What?

592
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,870
He took his vitamins.

593
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,410
He took his vitamins and grew 12 feet tall.

594
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,790
That's like Popeye.

595
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,890
When your nurse starts seeing things, I start worrying.

596
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,430
Isn't that...

597
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,570
No, we didn't go forward.

598
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,850
It feels like a safe room, no?

599
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,570
But what's...

600
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,670
What's over there, though?

601
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,730
Oh, it's a safe terminal.

602
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,030
Okay, but where is, like, the fucking basement?

603
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,770
Was it where we were before?

604
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,610
Weren't there stairs?

605
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,650
Not working.

606
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,130
Oh!

607
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,350
So that's...

608
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,550
Oh!

609
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,470
The one area we didn't go.

610
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,930
I think maybe there...

611
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,090
Oh, there's a lot of stuff in here.

612
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:48,710
A monitor.

613
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,710
A shelf for...

614
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,930
Oh, a shelf for special books!

615
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,770
Oh, the special book!

616
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,710
I'll go get it.

617
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,230
Alright.

618
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,430
We put them on in here.

619
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,390
Oh, there's a transmission status here.

620
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,950
So we put our special stuff here.

621
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,530
Okay.

622
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,510
Perma upgrades?

623
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:05,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

625
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,610
We're figuring it out.

626
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,730
How cozy.

627
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,810
Yeah.

628
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,550
Where did they go?

629
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,570
They have the special book and everything.

630
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,390
I got the special book.

631
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,250
Hello, little guy.

632
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,450
Aw, she's, like, purring.

633
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,530
Oh, wait!

634
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,370
The basement's here!

635
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:28,790
Guys!

636
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,730
The basement's here!

637
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,230
Okay.

638
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:31,790
Yeah.

639
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,650
Oh, yeah.

640
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,690
There were stairs.

641
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,890
There were stairs the entire time.

642
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,290
The whole time.

643
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,330
Well, it's good to explore.

644
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,430
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

645
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,270
We found, like, our little safe room, too.

646
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,010
Yeah.

647
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,750
I brought those.

648
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,310
Oh, guys!

649
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,210
We found the basement!

650
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,410
Does it work?

651
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,270
Does it work?

652
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,750
Okay.

653
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,130
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,130
Okay, I found the basement.

655
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,570
There were stairs that we forgot.

656
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,830
Oh, wait.

657
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,450
I think you put the...

658
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,910
Wait, it says installation monitor.

659
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,950
Do we have?

660
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,030
We put the monitor here?

661
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,230
A TV's a monitor.

662
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,430
A TV's a monitor.

663
00:23:59,170 --> 00:23:59,470
A monitor.

664
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:00,750
A monitor.

665
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,910
Guys, I don't think it's the TV.

666
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,670
I don't think it's the TV.

667
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,290
Maybe the TV's too old.

668
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,490
Yeah, it's too old.

669
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,870
It's not...

670
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,830
It's like a CRT.

671
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,790
We don't live in those ages anymore.

672
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,970
Alright, we found the...

673
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,050
Mint, get the fuck up.

674
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,330
We have...

675
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,030
We gotta find the moon!

676
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,830
We gotta...

677
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,090
Yeah, we gotta explore the basement.

678
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,870
We gotta find the moon, guys!

679
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,630
It's over here.

680
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,310
It's down here.

681
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,630
The moon!

682
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,510
Is there any explanation for the giant cat?

683
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,710
It's a moon cat.

684
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,450
I like him, though.

685
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,270
It's a spit...

686
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,410
Yeah.

687
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:41,610
Yeah.

688
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,590
He's purring.

689
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,830
Maybe he's like a guard...

690
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,250
It's like a guard dog, but a cat.

691
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,490
Maybe space is okay.

692
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:47,910
Yeah.

693
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,130
You know, space has giant cats.

694
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,330
Alright, ladies first.

695
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,350
Oh, this is a very suspicious entrance.

696
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,110
How do we go upstairs?

697
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,850
What's up here?

698
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,250
Um, it says explore the basement.

699
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,930
They're gonna punish you.

700
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:05,530
No!

701
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,130
Closed on the other side.

702
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,910
I think we have to do the basement before we can unlock the other floors.

703
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,070
Probably, yeah.

704
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,230
Can we fall?

705
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,070
Oh, we can't jump.

706
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,770
To a flip.

707
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,370
To a flip!

708
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,130
Alright, let's go downstairs.

709
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:26,590
Alright.

710
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,570
Doobie, you first.

711
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,410
You're a very brave woman.

712
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:30,610
What?

713
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,490
I've seen you break dance.

714
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,010
You can take them.

715
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,230
Oh my god, you're so brave, Doobie.

716
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,190
You're just...

717
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,550
You're just...

718
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,550
You're just...

719
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:44,970
You're so brave!

720
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,150
You're so strong and brave!

721
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,070
You don't care about me.

722
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,850
You don't care.

723
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:50,890
You don't care.

724
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,550
Yes, I do.

725
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,710
Of course I care.

726
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,510
I...

727
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,290
I thought you were gonna be my knight in China Gormor.

728
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,650
When dying, if there are other surviving players...

729
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,090
Uh...

730
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,330
Hi.

731
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,070
Oh, so this will be...

732
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:06,750
Hi.

733
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,510
Oh, all players must be into...

734
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,490
Oh, wow, it's really upset.

735
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,170
Uh...

736
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,170
We go to...

737
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,090
Basement 2.

738
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,270
There's a basement too?

739
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,910
That's just another basement.

740
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,150
Wait, do you guys have flashlights?

741
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:22,870
Yeah.

742
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,150
Yeah.

743
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,230
Oh, how do you turn it on?

744
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:26,790
Wait.

745
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,410
Oh.

746
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,370
Oh!

747
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:33,430
Oh!

748
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,670
Oh, where'd it go?

749
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,830
Wait, I think that's that guy.

750
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,050
I think that's the guy.

751
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,870
I think it's...

752
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,130
I think...

753
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,390
I think it's that guy.

754
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,570
There's a kid from outside.

755
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,910
This is the 12 feet guy.

756
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,010
This is the 12 feet guy.

757
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,110
The nevi saw.

758
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,770
Oh my gosh, she did see a guy.

759
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:55,230
Oh gosh.

760
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,350
We're like colliding so bad.

761
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:58,950
Oh.

762
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,110
We need a lever.

763
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,830
We need to find a lever.

764
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,050
Alright.

765
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,050
I can't see anything.

766
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,490
Someone with a flashlight go first.

767
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,050
You don't have a flashlight?

768
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:09,870
No.

769
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,490
I swear you're holding one.

770
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,450
It's a transmitter.

771
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,230
It's a transmitter.

772
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,590
Whatever that is.

773
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,850
Oh, I think because you're holding a transmitter.

774
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,270
Maybe.

775
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,270
I think someone's dead.

776
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,930
Wait, someone's dead?

777
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,430
Who's dead?

778
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,430
Oh my god.

779
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,110
That was you!

780
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,150
Wait, yeah.

781
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:23,970
It's Doopie1.

782
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,230
It's Doopie1.

783
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,210
It's Doopie1.

784
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,300
It's Doopie1.

785
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,440
Doopie1.

786
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,380
DoopieAlpha.

787
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,540
DoopieAlpha.

788
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,300
It's like that...

789
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,040
The Mickey...

790
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,440
What was it?

791
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,540
The one with Robert Pattinson?

792
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,660
Oh, I like that one.

793
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,300
Mickey17.

794
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,360
Yeah, Mickey17.

795
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,180
That was...

796
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,960
That was Doopie...

797
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,580
Doopie16.

798
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,960
Wait, where did Doopie17 go?

799
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,440
Doopie17, why did you go in here?

800
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,200
Doopie, Doopie.

801
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,760
Wait!

802
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,040
Doopie17, why did I get down there?

803
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,020
There's a monster down here.

804
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,360
Wait!

805
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,240
There's a monster down here.

806
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,280
Wait!

807
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,090
Oh my god, Did everybody get down, Doopie!

808
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,050
I got down.

809
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,310
It's aaurus!

810
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,250
It's a 210!

811
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,420
Doopie!

812
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,040
Doopie!

813
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,940
I don't think we can go back up.

814
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,300
I think... I guess we're about to meet Doobie 18.

815
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,980
Doobie 17 is gone.

816
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,140
I think it opened up this thing right here.

817
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,180
Oh, apparently Doobie... Oh my god.

818
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,000
No!

819
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,980
Okay, the timing of that was crazy.

820
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,260
Okay, do we have to restart?

821
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,120
Yeah, well let's restart the lobby then.

822
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,760
Yeah, we're pretty early on because we didn't know what to do.

823
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,440
I kinda wanna see what happens.

824
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,180
Alright, you guys wanna die to the monster together?

825
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Yeah.

826
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,280
Alright, we'll go.

827
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,760
Hopefully it's not too loud.

828
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,480
Sorry guys.

829
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,580
Prepare your ears.

830
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,840
Wait, where was he?

831
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,340
Over here.

832
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,280
Was he over here?

833
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,860
Oh, there he is!

834
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,880
Alright, who wants to die first?

835
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,400
I'll go.

836
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,840
Alright, we'll watch.

837
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,940
She's gonna get the...

838
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,220
She's gonna get the...

839
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,760
I don't know.

840
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,860
That was crazy.

841
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,720
Oh my god, okay.

842
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,020
Okay, I'll go.

843
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,280
I'll make a new lobby.

844
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,560
I'll make a new...

845
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,380
We all ended up back here, y'all.

846
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,100
Okay.

848
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,220
Oh my god, that was crazy.

849
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,780
I got dunked on.

850
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,160
Oh my god.

851
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,520
Okay, I made a new lobby.

852
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,960
Welcome back, everyone.

853
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:26,840
Hello.

854
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,420

860
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,220
Hi.

861
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,820

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,060
Holy shit.

863
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,480
I did not expect that death.

864
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,160
I...

865
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,260
It's so loud now.

866
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,240

867
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,720

That was fucking crazy.

870
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,520
Alright, I got you.

871
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,260
Alright, I said I...

872
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,940

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,280
Um...

874
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,920
Messaged Doobie that we made a new lobby.

875
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,040
Yay.

876
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,840
So we'll just wait.

877
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,860
I'm trying to send her an invite to me.

878
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,020
Oh yeah, I am.

879
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,260
Oh, okay.

880
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,920
Yeah, yeah.

881
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,880
Yeah, cause I wasn't able to send an invite.

882
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,460
Alright, I'm gonna go get water real quick.

883
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,040
I'll be right back.

884
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,140
Okay.

885
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,760
Sorry, I'm back.

886
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,260
No, don't be sorry.

887
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,080
No problem.

888
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:27,700
Oh my god.

889
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,980
We saw you died, whore.

890
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,400
We turned the corner.

891
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,680
We go look for you.

892
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,560
We found the monster.

893
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,140
I did, that's what happened.

894
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,000
That's why.

895
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,860
Disconnected me.

896
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,720
Alright, I'm back.

897
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,320
Oh my god.

898
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm back.

899
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,340
Doobie.

900
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,020
Oh, we're back.

901
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,960
You crash at like the perfect time.

902
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,820
Really?

903
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,980
We're like, we're like, oh man.

904
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,840
Yeah, I hope we don't have to clone Doobie17 and then you disappeared.

905
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,860
Alright, now we can speedrun it.

906
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,800
We know we know.

907
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,600
Alright, we know, we know.

909
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,780
Alright, I'll start the lobby.

910
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:04,840
Okay.

911
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:05,600
Okay.

912
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:05,660
Alright.

913
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
Oh, hello everyone.

914
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,840
We're here.

915
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,780
Yeah, we're here, right here.

916
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,320
We're back here.

917
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,840
Yeah, yeah, okay, we know what the alien does.

918
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,440
We know.

919
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,620
What do you mean?

920
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,520
Um, okay.

921
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,680
Okay, actually, no, we can watch Doobie also encounter him.

922
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,520
What?

923
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:19,620
What?

924
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,940
Yeah, Doobie, we all, it's like initiation.

925
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,940
We all did it.

926
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,000
We all...

927
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,740
Yeah, exactly.

928
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:26,540
Yeah.

929
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,240
Alright, he's friendly, right?

930
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,160
Yeah.

931
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,640
Oh, yeah.

932
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,920
Oh, yeah, very friendly.

933
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,640
We all got a hug from him, right, guys?

934
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,280
This isn't related to the picture you guys showed me earlier, right?

935
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,700
Oh, okay, there he is.

936
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:46,760
Oh.

937
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:46,840
Oh.

938
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,100
Alright, Doobie.

939
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,720
He really just does that, doesn't he?

940
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,820
Alright, Doobie 18.

941
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,420
Woohoo!

942
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,080
Time to get to work.

943
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,340
Is this right?

944
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,560
Yeah, I think so.

945
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,380
Wasn't he around here?

946
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah, he was right here.

947
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,820
And then the left side.

948
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,940
We'll watch.

949
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,440
He's right here.

950
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,280
Okay, ready, Doobie?

951
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:09,980
Oh, I see him!

952
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,840
Yeah.

953
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,060
Are we gonna die him?

954
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,920
No, no.

955
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,120
No, we all gave him a little hug.

956
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,800
How did we get him not to see us, though?

957
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,160
I think we could go left.

958
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,180
Yeah, I think we have to go around him.

959
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah.

960
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,200
Oh, wait, this is just the beginning.

961
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,120
This is the area.

962
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,420
Is it?

963
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,520
Oh, I think this is a shortcut.

964
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,360
Like a...

965
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,800
Like a little shortcut area.

966
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,460
I think this is where you're supposed to find the lever handle.

967
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,720
Isn't that...

968
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,520
Don't let it see you.

969
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:32,760
Oh, yeah.

970
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,760
Don't let it see you.

971
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:34,980
Ah, okay.

972
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,280
Okay, so like...

973
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,320
That should be easy.

974
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,780
That should be easy.

975
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,280
We could use one of us as bait.

976
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,280
Good idea.

977
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:42,920
You should go.

978
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,040
As the idea person here.

979
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,080
If I die, who else will have all these good ideas?

980
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,020
He's gone, I think.

981
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,820
I don't see him.

982
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,340
Oh, okay.

983
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,840
He hears your footsteps?

984
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:57,860
Oh.

985
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,580
Uh-oh.

986
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,160
Oh, okay.

987
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,620
What did this book say?

988
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,420
You know, like...

989
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,860
Okay, we look like that character in Pigment.

990
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,900
Oh, I think he's done.

991
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,220
Wait.

992
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,620
Oh.

993
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,060
Ah!

994
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,920
Ah!

995
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,220
Ah!

996
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,940
Ah!

997
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,640
Ah!

998
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,900
Ah!

999
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,100
Ah!

1000
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,580
Ah!

1001
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,420
Ah!

1002
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:15,980
Ah!

1003
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,720
I can't!

1004
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,500
Ah!

1005
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:18,920
Ah!

1006
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,220
No!

1007
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,140
Ah!

1008
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:21,860
Ah!

1009
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,100
Ah!

1010
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,500
Ah!

1011
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:24,680
Ah!

1012
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,620
Ah!

1013
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:27,640
Ah!

1014
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,020
Oh, my God!

1015
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,600
Oh, my God!

1016
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,720
Oh, my God!

1017
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:36,860
Oh, my God!

1018
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:36,900
No!

1019
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:37,660
Oh, my God!

1020
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,280
The monster crush do be on top of my body, so I couldn't move!

1021
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,360
I couldn't...

1022
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,620
I couldn't get away!

1023
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,560
It was...

1024
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:46,760
It was...

1025
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,160
He's...

1026
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,260
He's the Costco guy!

1027
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,600
I get...

1028
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,920
I get...

1029
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,800
I get poor big boobs!

1030
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,660
Big boobs!

1031
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,540
Big boobs!

1032
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,500
Boo!

1033
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,780
Boo!

1034
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,900
Boo!

1035
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,320
Okay.

1036
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,500
How do we do this?

1037
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,300
We just...

1038
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,540
We gotta go right...

1039
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,660
Don't let him see us!

1040
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,180
Don't let him see us!

1041
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,440
Yeah!

1042
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,940
He's got all of us!

1043
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,460
That's crazy!

1044
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:10,800
Yeah!

1045
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,240
He had to be fair!

1046
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
I was just standing there!

1047
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,920
We were just standing there!

1048
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Maybe he wouldn't get me if I just stood still!

1049
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
Can he hear a microphone?

1050
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,080
Does that play?

1051
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,220
Oh, that's true!

1052
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,720
No, it says don't let it see you, though!

1053
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,220
No, it also said he hears your footsteps, though!

1054
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,900
Oh, okay!

1055
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,920
So we just have to crouch!

1056
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,040
Yeah, I think so!

1057
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,660
Okay, be very, very quiet!

1058
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,880
I'm hunting wabbits!

1059
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,660
Wabbits, yeah!

1060
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,980
I wanna see where this line goes!

1061
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,260
Be very...

1062
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Be very quiet!

1063
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,580
Be quiet!

1064
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,000
Okay, I think, like, he does go back and go forward, so, like, we just gotta wait for him to do that, right?

1065
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,440
Yeah, we know that it's a dead end now, but we can open up this!

1066
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,200
Yeah, which we did, didn't...

1067
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,900
Open the door!

1068
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,160
Thank you!

1069
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,540
Oh, my gosh!

1070
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,360
He had me!

1071
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,040
Alright...

1072
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,080
We just gotta wait for him to come back, and then he'll, like, go forward.

1073
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,060
Oh, right, yeah, because we have to make the first right?

1074
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have to...

1075
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,140
Yeah, yeah, and then he did come back!

1076
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,920
But I think he'll see us here, right?

1077
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,260
There's no way...

1078
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,620
Oh, wait, no, there was a...

1079
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,560
No, no, no, because, like, Nimi ran up to him, remember?

1080
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,080
Oh, that's...

1081
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,920
That's right, that's right.

1082
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,300
Yeah, so, maybe he's, like...

1083
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,060
You know, like, there's some animals that can't see, like, more than, like, five feet?

1084
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,220
You can hear him coming, too.

1085
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,080
Like, things just get...

1086
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,520
It's like how, like, crocodiles can't see in front of them.

1087
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,060
Oh, there you go, see?

1088
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,580
Let's shimmy over.

1089
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:43,450
Okay.

1090
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,770
Guys, I don't think we should be in the dead end.

1091
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,170
Oh, there was a thing here.

1092
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,390
Oh, did we turn our flashlights off?

1093
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,110
Okay.

1094
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,270
Okay, guys, I think this is a bad idea.

1095
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,010
I think we should have went forward.

1096
00:36:59,230 --> 00:36:59,670
Should we go?

1097
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,230
What?

1098
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,530
You didn't have to follow me!

1099
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,750
You were the leader!

1100
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,410
You were the leader!

1101
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,970
Wait, maybe we're fine.

1102
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,570
Maybe we could...

1103
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,570
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,710
Oh, you're fine?

1105
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,630
Maybe he jumped out the window.

1106
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,450
Yeah, maybe he could.

1107
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:15,910
Yeah, yeah.

1108
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,410
You know what?

1109
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,030
I believe that.

1110
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,770
Maybe he jumped off the building.

1111
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,750
He didn't jump off the window!

1112
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,290
He didn't jump...

1113
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:24,310
Yeah!

1114
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,320
Everything is fine.

1115
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,980
I'm okay.

1116
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,260
I'm alive!

1117
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,140
I'm so alive!

1118
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,990
Am I the only one left?

1119
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,730
I'm alive!

1120
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,940
No!

1121
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,700
No!

1122
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,980
I'm okay.

1123
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,260
I'm okay.

1124
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,740
I'm okay.

1125
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,760
I'm okay.

1126
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,760
Is it just me?

1127
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,040
Am I the only one left?

1128
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,420
Okay.

1129
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,560
Everything is okay.

1130
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,160
I'll be a hero.

1131
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,190
Oh.

1132
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,250
I'm gonna be a hero.

1133
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,790
Don't worry, I'll go where no one has gone before.

1134
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,110
Oh my god, where am I?

1135
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,430
Where am I?

1136
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,580
What is all of this?

1137
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,020
Oh!

1138
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,650
I'm stuck!

1139
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,730
Is there nowhere else to go?

1140
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,000
Is this...

1141
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,720
No, it's fucking closed!

1142
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,620
No!

1143
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:16,820
No!

1144
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,300
I missed it!

1145
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,500
Nobody sees me here, right?

1146
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,140
I'm the main character, baby!

1147
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,070
I'm the main character.

1148
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm lost.

1149
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,180
I think it's here.

1150
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1151
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:43,690
I did it!

1152
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,090
Oh my god, I did it!

1153
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,750
I saved the run!

1154
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,650
Oh yeah.

1155
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,990
Alright.

1156
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,890
Okay guys, I did it!

1157
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,070
Guys, I'm a hero.

1158
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,310
You're welcome.

1159
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,450
It's like, surprise!

1160
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,620
To be honest, I didn't have any faith in you.

1161
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,200
That's right!

1162
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,200
Bro, when he was like in...

1163
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,580
I was just up here in the corner, and he just walked past me.

1164
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,720
Yeah!

1165
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,780
You're a gay man.

1166
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,700
Oh my god.

1167
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,220
We're outside now, yeah!

1168
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,080
I think they're gone.

1169
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,360
I think they're inside.

1170
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,240
You better hide!

1171
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,620
What?

1172
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,560
What does that mean?

1173
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,660
But we're outside!

1174
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:54,960
I'm hiding!

1175
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:55,400
Oh!

1176
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,400
I'm gonna hide!

1177
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,720
Whoa!

1178
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,900
Doobie,

1179
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,840
why didn't...

1180
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,460
Doobie, why did you...

1181
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,740
Why did you just stand there?

1182
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,420
Okay, it's okay.

1183
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,280
I believe it, man.

1184
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,420
Where did he... Where did they come from?

1185
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,880
What are they supposed to do?

1186
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Get into the library.

1187
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,580
Is it like she just came from the gate, killed all of us, and then left?

1188
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,800
He just... Why did he just leave?

1189
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,040
I think it is.

1190
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,660
Fire inside.

1191
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,560
Oh, yeah, we're live!

1192
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,250
Crazy.

1193
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,390
What's that?

1194
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,250
What happened?

1195
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,330
We just...

1196
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,650
I don't know.

1197
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,490
I was stunlocked because Doofy was like not moving.

1198
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,850
I was changing a setting.

1199
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:35,950
I was trying to fix something.

1200
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,410
When died or others, the players become one in the... Oh, wait.

1201
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,290
This is like basically how to revive people.

1202
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,630
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1203
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,790
What was that thing, though?

1204
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:47,510
I don't know.

1205
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,170
That was crazy.

1206
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:48,730
Spider, right?

1207
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,410
Yeah, it was a giant head spider.

1208
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,430
Oh, shoot.

1209
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,910
Oh, we can carry three items.

1210
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,370
Yeah, that's good to know.

1211
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,670
Yeah, yeah.

1212
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,110
I feel like we just have to follow the line.

1213
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,930
Storage of electrical... Okay, we need... Oh, wait.

1214
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,290
We have electrical boxes?

1215
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,130
Oh, where'd you get those?

1216
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,050
Electrical boxes and apply them to empty slots of electrical circuits.

1217
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:09,650
I have a computer.

1218
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,250
Oh, nice.

1219
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,130
Oh, nice.

1220
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:12,730
Steal it.

1221
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,270
That's good.

1222
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,370
We can sell it on eBay.

1223
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:22,730
Yeah.

1224
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,170
New for me.

1225
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,030
We gotta provide power to the door.

1226
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,650
Alright.

1227
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,670
But I have one of the electrical... Oh, there you go.

1228
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,290
I found one.

1229
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,990
Yeah, I found an empty slot.

1230
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,910
Oh, I found it.

1231
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,550
It's like they're like little squares on the thing.

1232
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,330
You see it?

1233
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:43,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1234
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,450
So you gotta like apply it.

1235
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:46,630
Okay, okay.

1236
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,970
Is there another one here?

1237
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,430
Oh, one here.

1238
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,090
One on me.

1239
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:52,630
One on me.

1240
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,150
Oh.

1241
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:53,870
Here.

1242
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:54,590
Okay.

1243
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,390
One here.

1244
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:56,830
One here.

1245
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,070
Oh.

1246
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:57,890
Yeah.

1247
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,210
Wait, there has to be another one.

1248
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,890
Where did you find the first couple?

1249
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:05,870
Oh.

1250
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,190
Oh.

1251
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,350
We put that in here.

1252
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,190
Oh, is there any more?

1253
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,330
Oh, there's one here.

1254
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,430
But we don't have any more electrical boxes.

1255
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,890
We need to...

1256
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,990
Maybe it's outside.

1257
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,630
Maybe it's outside.

1258
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,210
Oh, wait.

1259
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,810
Oh, wait.

1260
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,830
Maybe like...

1261
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,350
We have to unlock...

1262
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,010
Cause like...

1263
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,570
We have to unlock another area.

1264
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,130
Maybe.

1265
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,230
Oh, yeah.

1266
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:28,870
I like it.

1267
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,330
Maybe we have to unlock this door first.

1268
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,350
Is there one we can take from...

1269
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,570
From the other side?

1270
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,190
I'm gonna check all the others.

1271
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:41,750
I'm gonna check all the others.

1272
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,190
Cause I think we have to unlock the...

1273
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,670
The door.

1274
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,630
The...

1275
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,930
The door on the left...

1276
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,510
The right side.

1277
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,230
Okay.

1278
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,430
I'm gonna take this one.

1279
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,260
One...

1280
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,960
I have one more.

1281
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,480
I took it from the other side.

1282
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,080
Is there one that hasn't been put on?

1283
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,080
Looks like a Wii.

1284
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:05,800
Oh, here.

1285
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,020
Okay.

1286
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,450
No, no.

1287
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,010
I think we gotta do this one first.

1288
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,710
Oh, okay.

1289
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,850
Like a puzzle or something.

1290
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,810
Oh, my gosh.

1291
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:16,770
We gotta think.

1292
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,150
Use our brains.

1293
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,770
There's two more here on this side.

1294
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,590
Wait, but why...

1295
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,270
No, I think we have to do the...

1296
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,270
But why would we have to do the right side first?

1297
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:29,670
Oh, wait.

1298
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,650
This doesn't go anywhere.

1299
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,530
Yeah, I don't know where it all leads up.

1300
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,110
I thought it was to this door.

1301
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,490
I think it's all connected.

1302
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,170
I think we have to do this side.

1303
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:38,870
This wall first.

1304
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,450
I think we have to do the left side first.

1305
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,230
Your precious computer.

1306
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,110
Your computer!

1307
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:44,950
Your computer!

1308
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,570
The gaming PC!

1309
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,490
Okay.

1310
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,890
I'm gonna do the left side.

1311
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,090
That's an item in my pocket.

1312
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,090
Okay.

1313
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:57,410
Uh...

1314
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,690
I have one extra for this side, but is there anything else?

1315
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,210
We can put it on.

1316
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,390
I

1317
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,490
found a storage.

1318
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,930
There's two electrical boxes in this crate.

1319
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,630
Oh!

1320
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,250
Oh!

1321
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,030
Wait, can we crawl through here?

1322
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:17,210
Oh!

1323
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,610
You just yoink it?

1324
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:19,910
Yay.

1325
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,210
We have to make the line green.

1326
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,150
Wait, why is it not turning green?

1327
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:27,470
Oh.

1328
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,550
Maybe cause...

1329
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:28,590
Oh!

1330
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,630
Cause it's all connected!

1331
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:31,770
Oh!

1332
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,550
I'm so dumb.

1333
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:33,450
It's all connected.

1334
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,410
Yeah, I think so.

1335
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,050
Over here, over here, over here.

1336
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:38,990
Wait, where?

1337
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:39,590
Over there?

1338
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:40,150
Yeah, yeah.

1339
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,450
Oh, I see it, I see it.

1340
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,930
Yeah, now it should all be connected.

1341
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,990
We just missed that one.

1342
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,470
Yeah, okay, okay.

1343
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:45,950
Yay!

1344
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:46,390
Yay!

1345
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:47,290
We did it!

1346
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,610
We solved the puzzle!

1347
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,250
Yay!

1348
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,930
Our brain screwed three times that day.

1349
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,390
Alright.

1350
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,190
There was a monster running around over here.

1351
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,250
There was a monster running around over here.

1352
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,230
Wait, install the monitor.

1353
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:06,550
Really?

1354
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,110
That's what this monitor's for!

1355
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:09,770
Do me your time!

1356
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:10,550
Your time!

1357
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,970
It's your time to shine!

1358
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,990
Oh, right here?

1359
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,350
No, this is input device one.

1360
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,770
Wait, do we need the transmitter?

1361
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,250
Uh-oh.

1362
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,670
No, no, I have one of the devices.

1363
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:26,810
I wanna play with this puzzle.

1364
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:27,450
You guys can't.

1365
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,330
I'm done with this toy.

1366
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,370
I wanna play with this new toy.

1367
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,090
I believe in you.

1368
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:33,530
Alright.

1369
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,710
Wait, yeah, actually, please do that.

1370
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,850
Yeah, we'll watch- We'll watch Doobie solve this puzzle.

1371
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:41,730
No pressure!

1372
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,250
No pressure or anything!

1373
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,030
No, no, no!

1374
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,870
All three of us are watching right now.

1375
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,130
You got this.

1376
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,050
Maybe I messed it up.

1377
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,430
No, you didn't.

1378
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,050
No, yo.

1379
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,250
I believe in you.

1380
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,030
I'm gonna start backseating.

1381
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:58,830
Yeah, me too.

1382
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,130
I think it's a pie.

1383
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:00,530
Yeah.

1384
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,930
Streamer, why didn't you move that tile shape down there?

1385
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,110
You have to slide it.

1386
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,690
Oh my god.

1387
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,470
You just had it.

1388
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,670
I would slide it.

1389
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,590
Too realistic.

1390
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,410
Move that one.

1391
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,290
Move that one.

1392
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,230
Move that one.

1393
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,170
Streamer, you should've moved the other one.

1394
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,070
You just had it.

1395
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:31,370
You had the- Oh my gosh.

1396
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,390
Streamer, why did you do that?

1397
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,270
I solved it in two seconds.

1398
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:37,690
Yeah.

1399
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,690
Um, my child was able to solve this.

1400
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:46,130
Oh!

1401
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,780
I knew she could do it.

1402
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,840
I knew she could do it.

1403
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,160
Wait, is that a Ouija board?

1404
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,020
A Luigi board?

1405
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,120
A Luigi board?

1406
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,680
At chat, where's the ghost?

1407
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,020
I think we need a table.

1408
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,120
I think- I'm pretty sure we have to move forward, right?

1409
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,880
There's a- there's a monster running about.

1410
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,440
So, uh, we can go outside.

1411
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:12,840
Um, you know.

1412
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,040
I mean, we could come back here.

1413
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:14,720
What's the book do?

1414
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,860
Oh, I said- I don't know where- There's like that one room.

1415
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,360
Yeah, yeah.

1416
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,500
Remember that office we unlocked?

1417
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,980
They said we could, like, keep it.

1418
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,340
So, like, maybe there's gonna be a safe room or something.

1419
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,500
We could just put it there.

1420
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,380
Yeah.

1421
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,620
I'll- I'll read it.

1422
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,660
I'll bring the- I'll bring the special board.

1423
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,680
We gotta go.

1424
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,040
To install this, we have to defeat the monster.

1425
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,400
No.

1426
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,020
I'm scared.

1427
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Wait, what- Is there something outside?

1428
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,340
I saw it run in the hallway upstairs.

1429
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,380
Oh, there's a safe spot.

1430
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,020
Oh, nice.

1431
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,720
In the halls.

1432
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,580
Yeah.

1433
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,160
Alright, we're all here.

1434
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,080
Oh, this is- Yeah, this is- Wait.

1435
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,360
This is- Isn't this the elevator we went down to the basement before?

1436
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,400
Oh, so we have to go back.

1437
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,020
Yeah.

1438
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:57,880
Oh, we go back.

1439
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,640
Oh, then we, like, plug in these for the- the- our room.

1440
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,400
Yeah, I think so.

1441
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:03,860
Oh.

1442
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,300
Our sweet gaming room.

1443
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,200
Did you hear that?

1444
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,060
Did you hear that?

1445
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,300
Did you hear that?

1446
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,260
Did you hear that?

1447
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,280
Wait, the cat's gone!

1448
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,880
The cat no!

1449
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,060
Where did the cat go?

1450
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,000
Wait, this is where I saw the monster running around.

1451
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,460
Wait, this is where I saw the monster running around.

1452
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:18,980
Look at the snake!

1453
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,820
He ate it!

1454
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,120
Oh!

1455
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,810
It looks really cute!

1456
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,670
It's a- I mean, it looks really cute.

1457
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:26,970
It's an ink monster.

1458
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,330
Yeah, look.

1459
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:27,990
It looks so cute.

1460
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,390
Look at him.

1461
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,330
Aw, he's friendly!

1462
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,330
Look, guys!

1463
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,690
Do you think it ate the cat?

1464
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:33,910
What's that?

1465
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:34,890
What is that?

1466
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:35,570
That's a robot waifu?

1467
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:36,750
Wait, what?

1468
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,710
Yeah, you see her?

1469
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,410
Oh, she is kinda weeny.

1470
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:42,870
Oh, wait!

1471
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,610
Oh, shit!

1472
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:44,250
Yeah!

1473
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:46,010
That's scary.

1474
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,250
You guys shouldn't get too close.

1475
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,610
Oh.

1476
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,130
She's like that- like the girl version of that Resident Evil gal.

1477
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,010
Hey, you looking for something, too?

1478
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:53,970
Oh, yeah.

1479
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:55,370
Something like that.

1480
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,010
Oh, I see.

1481
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,470
Yeah, I'm looking for a- a partner.

1482
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,690
She's like the- the guy in Resident Evil 2.

1483
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,190
Oh, what are you buying?

1484
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,170
No, no, no, no, no.

1485
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,250
Is it Resident Evil 2?

1486
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,370
The guy that chases you that- in the trench coat.

1487
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,370
But like a girl version.

1488
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:11,790
Wait, what is- what did we give her?

1489
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:14,950
The moon?

1490
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:15,630
The moon?

1491
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,410
How can the moon even be there?

1492
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,250
Oh, I have the keyboard.

1493
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:18,750
Yeah.

1494
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,430
The worm is being really noisy behind me.

1495
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,290
I don't like it.

1496
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,130
It sounds really weird.

1497
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:26,370
Oh, this is Mrs. X!

1498
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,370
Wait, she has anime eyes!

1499
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,270
Look at her eyes!

1500
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,410
Look at her eyes!

1501
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,930
It's like the how to- how to draw anime.

1502
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:35,930
New objective!

1503
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,990
Find out the password.

1504
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,070
Use chat with the manager.

1505
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,290
Oh!

1506
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,030
Oh!

1507
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,630
Yeah!

1508
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,730
Get out of here!

1509
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,890
That's chat!

1510
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,290
Get out of here!

1511
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,310
That's chat!

1512
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,870
That's chat!

1513
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,310
He's like streamer, why?

1514
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,090
Aw!

1515
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,310
Hey guys, I'm here to help with that puzzle from earlier!

1516
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,890
Oh, chat's following a chat- I feel bad!

1517
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,590
I thought Wordle.

1518
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,570
You're like Wordle?

1519
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,210
How do we find the password?

1520
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,950
Use chat with a man- What the fuck does- At chat, what's the password?

1521
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,150
He's in here!

1522
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:23,050
He's making the ground nasty!

1523
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,550
You're disgusting!

1524
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,650
You're an outside pet!

1525
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:27,070
Take that out!

1526
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,790
You're not an indoor pet- hurts morehö we out- Oh yeah!

1527
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,070
He's back!

1528
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,310
He's back!

1529
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,530
Oh my God!

1530
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:48,270
He's back!

1531
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,530
He's back!

1532
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:52,950
What happened?

1533
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,510
This was your fault, man.

1534
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,090
You made fun of him.

1535
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,630
Look what you did, man.

1536
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,650
He got angry.

1537
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,390
You did this.

1538
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:17,710
Oh, my God.

1539
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,470
Did they die?

1540
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,230
Wait, we can revive her up here.

1541
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,350
We can revive her.

1542
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:24,410
Right?

1543
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,370
Oh, wait, no.

1544
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,550
We can revive her.

1545
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,630
Up top, up top.

1546
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,530
We have to revive her.

1547
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,430
She went the wrong way.

1548
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:36,050
Oh, welcome back.

1549
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,850
Hold on, I gotta get the monitor.

1550
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:39,570
I dropped it.

1551
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,010
Wrong way.

1552
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,570
No, no.

1553
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,550
Is it the elevator?

1554
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,210
I don't remember.

1555
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,750
No, we went this way before.

1556
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,250
I think we just got unlucky.

1557
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,030
Oh, we... Oh, okay.

1558
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,130
Yeah, we just... Doobie literally went over and then just slammed on.

1559
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,070
Yeah, but this is one for the team.

1560
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,730
It's like, where did it come from?

1561
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,490
I thought I heard it.

1562
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,730
Alright, never... Don't make chat angry, man.

1563
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,810
The worm is not friendly.

1564
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,790
He was friendly.

1565
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:18,910
Just ignore him.

1566
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:18,930
Just ignore him.

1567
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,230
He was friendly until you got mean to him.

1568
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,910
You were so mean to him.

1569
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:28,950
Okay, wait, I'm gonna... I'm gonna talk to the anime girl again.

1570
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,050
Yeah.

1571
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:30,330
Yeah.

1572
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,810
Guys, he's coming.

1573
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,030
He's out his way.

1574
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,110
Yeah.

1575
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:34,950
I'm sorry.

1576
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:35,550
I'm sorry.

1577
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:35,970
I'm sorry.

1578
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,250
I don't need to tell you to shower.

1579
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,990
Why are you so tall?

1580
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,090
Don't look at him.

1581
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:41,910
Don't even look at him.

1582
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,070
Yeah, don't look at him.

1583
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,130
Don't look at him.

1584
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:45,410
Boob.

1585
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,130
Enter the password.

1586
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,090
What's a four letter.

1587
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:50,430
What's a four letter?

1588
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,310
Think it opened doors.

1589
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,150
Think it opened doors.

1590
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,370
The password is eight zero zero eight.

1591
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,470
Boob.

1592
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:57,850
There's no letters.

1593
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:58,910
I mean, there's no numbers.

1594
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,750
We can do regular.

1595
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,770
B, O, V.

1596
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:05,690
Wait, is it?

1597
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:05,810
Wait, is it?

1598
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,050
Yeah, we could just do actual boob.

1599
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,090
Yeah, just actually write boob.

1600
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,890
Wait.

1601
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,210
How do we tell our manager?

1602
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,430
Just chat with the manager.

1603
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:12,910
Yeah.

1604
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,970
How do we... You think it's moon?

1605
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,050
Somebody has to go woo the manager.

1606
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,190
Who's the manager?

1607
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,490
I want to speak to your manager.

1608
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,230
Oh, there.

1609
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,350
Oh, I got it.

1610
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,190
Wait, what was it?

1611
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,210
What was the password?

1612
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:31,410
It was moon.

1613
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,050
Oh, the transmitter.

1614
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:35,950
Wait.

1615
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,030
Wait.

1616
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:37,930
Button.

1617
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,470
Oh, no, the transmitter.

1618
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,090
Where is it?

1619
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,050
Right here.

1620
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:43,610
Right here.

1621
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:44,510
No, I'm real.

1622
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:45,170
Oh.

1623
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:52,520
Where is he?

1624
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,910
He disappeared.

1625
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:57,570
He disappeared.

1626
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1627
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:00,170
He poofed himself.

1628
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,050
He disappeared.

1629
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1630
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,150
You wait.

1631
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:04,990
Did you be live?

1632
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:05,630
Did you close?

1633
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,390
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

1634
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,990
He's just sore, go door.

1635
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,210
He's just sitting there.

1636
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,240
You guys all ran, so...

1637
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,660
I thought that was Doobie coming out of the other door, but it was a bad guy.

1638
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,600
It was a very bad man.

1639
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,240
Wait, guys.

1640
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,900
No, I'm... Is it like... Remember when we were holding a transmitter earlier?

1641
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:35,860
Yeah.

1642
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,000
Where did we left that?

1643
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,000
Where did we leave?

1644
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,740
We should go save somewhere.

1645
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,860
I think so, too.

1646
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,500
Yeah, okay, but where did we leave the transmitter?

1647
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,240
It's in the van at the start.

1648
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:47,920
No.

1649
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,180
No.

1650
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,080
It can't be that far.

1651
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:49,600
No.

1652
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,500
Okay, we gotta retrace our steps.

1653
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,940
I think it was in the basement, though.

1654
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,800
Yeah, no.

1655
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,520
It had to be.

1656
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,560
We left items.

1657
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Oh, I think it was when... I think it was at the very beginning of the basement.

1658
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,500
Okay.

1659
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,320
Remember when, like... It was easy, yeah.

1660
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,280
Yeah, yeah, with the man.

1661
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,320
With the slam dunker.

1662
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,240
Well, he's upstairs now, so... Oh, okay.

1663
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,140
Well, we just have to... Okay, we... One of us just has to live.

1664
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,380
Okay.

1665
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,640
All right, I'll stay here.

1666
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:16,760
Okay.

1667
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:16,760
We're dead.

1668
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,760
It's all on YouTube.

1669
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,400
It's on.

1670
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,100
Wait, how would Doobie know when we're dead?

1671
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,840
Wait, how would... What if Chai comes back?

1672
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,240
Okay.

1673
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,880
I'm gonna crouch walk.

1674
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:31,780
We'll be fine.

1675
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,300
Okay, but how... Yeah, I was gonna say... How would Doobie know when we're all dead?

1676
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,900
When we never come back.

1677
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,820
We just... It's just... She waits an hour alone in the room and was like, guys, I think she might be dead.

1678
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:45,960
Yeah.

1679
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,120
Yeah.

1680
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,460
All right.

1681
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,960
Where is she?

1682
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,480
Where was... Oh, there was a safe right at the bottom here.

1683
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:58,880
Yeah, yeah.

1684
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,000
So, you could just... Yeah.

1685
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,260
I remember that, too.

1686
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,380
The monster probably can't be in the safe point.

1687
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,560
He probably is.

1688
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:05,820
Yeah.

1689
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,880
I can't believe that it's not, like, a safe point.

1690
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,940
Like, it's a safe point, but it's not a safe.

1691
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,480
It's not safe.

1692
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,560
It's not a safe room.

1693
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:11,900
Yeah.

1694
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,540
There is no safe room.

1695
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,840
Okay, let's save.

1696
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,880
Yeah, the room feels pretty safe.

1697
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,100
All right.

1698
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,140
Game has been safe.

1699
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,340
We all died in here from the ink blob.

1700
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:23,900
Oh, yeah.

1701
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:32,760
If someone didn't piss him off... Wait, where's... Where's Doobie?

1702
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,200
He got pissed off again.

1703
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,240
Doobie?

1704
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:35,680
Doobie?

1705
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,740
Oh, wait.

1706
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,640
Did Doobie crash again?

1707
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,660
Doobie.

1708
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:39,900
Doobie.

1709
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,700
Oh, I hear him.

1710
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:40,880
Oh, no.

1711
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,260
Not here.

1712
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:42,840
Doobie.

1713
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:43,820
Doobie.

1714
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,660
Doobie, Marco.

1715
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:45,740
Doobie.

1716
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:46,660
Doobie.

1717
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:47,600
Doobie.

1718
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:47,880
Doobie.

1719
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:47,960
Doobie.

1720
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,200
Doobie.

1721
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,900
Oh, it's, like, bat.

1722
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,500
Whoa, what's going on in there?

1723
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,440
Oh, there's an evil creature out there.

1724
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,120
Do you see that?

1725
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,720
The one that's 12 feet tall?

1726
00:59:59,420 --> 00:59:59,740
Yes.

1727
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,540
No.

1728
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,560
Stand right where I'm standing.

1729
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,680
Oh, it's the cat.

1730
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,120
Is that a cat?

1731
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:07,220
Yeah.

1732
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,260
It has red eyes.

1733
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,540
So, it must be evil.

1734
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,000
All cats are evil.

1735
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:13,600
He's scanning.

1736
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:14,200
No!

1737
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,500
No!

1738
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,780
Guys, don't look for you!

1739
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,520
Oh, no.

1740
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,040
Wait, where's Doobie?

1741
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,180
Do you think he got her?

1742
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,440
Do you think... Doobie!

1743
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,920
No, because her body would be coming after us.

1744
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,580
Hi!

1745
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,660
Oh, no, no!

1746
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,520
I hear her!

1747
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:31,960
I hear her!

1748
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,700
She's like, here!

1749
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,180
Hello!

1750
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,100
Oh, there you are!

1751
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,320
Alright, we go this way.

1752
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,500
We're gonna go in the basement.

1753
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:39,680
Alright.

1754
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,900
Easter egg found.

1755
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,920
Basement number two.

1756
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,120
Wait, now where's Mint?

1757
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,300
Oh, I didn't know you guys were waiting for me.

1758
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:45,640
Sorry.

1759
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1760
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:46,720
That's okay.

1761
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,460
It was in basement number two.

1762
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:49,600
Yeah.

1763
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,300
Alright.

1764
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,240
Don't let him on the elevator.

1765
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,700
Yeah, don't let the...

1766
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,680
No boys allowed in the elevator.

1767
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,220
Yeah, for the transfer.

1768
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,340
Yeah, it was like, right here.

1769
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,760
This is where you all died.

1770
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,580
And I lived.

1771
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,200
Oh, yeah, here it is.

1772
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:04,400
Okay.

1773
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,460
And became a hero.

1774
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,100
It was like, to the right.

1775
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,720
Oh, he's there.

1776
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,060
He's there.

1777
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:11,380
He's there.

1778
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,760
Okay, one of us...

1779
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,980
One of us has to live.

1780
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:21,050
Only one of us has to live and also grab the transmitter.

1781
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,730
I don't see if I left it over here.

1782
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,870
No, it was like when all of us died in that pile.

1783
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:27,870
I'm just checking.

1784
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,390
Just being very sure.

1785
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,190
I think it is in that hallway where we all died.

1786
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,010
I think so too.

1787
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:32,310
Yeah, it is.

1788
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,410
I think it's where we first initially died.

1789
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:34,790
Yeah.

1790
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,990
And it...

1791
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,090
Like, cause I never came back.

1792
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,010
So it's by the dead end area.

1793
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:40,370
Yeah.

1794
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,250
No, it's the...

1795
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:41,590
I'll go.

1796
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:42,370
It's the right side.

1797
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,950
Yeah, no, it's the right side.

1798
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,310
Yeah, the first dead end on the right.

1799
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:47,950
Oh, over there?

1800
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:49,390
Oh, you do?

1801
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:52,630
I got it.

1802
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:54,190
Alright, yeah, now we go back!

1803
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,690
Let's go, let's go, let's go before he sees us.

1804
01:01:58,730 --> 01:01:59,750
Wait, which way is up?

1805
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,390
Um...

1806
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,630
Oh, this way, this way, this way.

1807
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,470
Right here, right here.

1808
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:04,950
Okay, that's...

1809
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:07,730
I like how all of us ran past the elevator.

1810
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:08,450
Is this all we needed?

1811
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,550
There wasn't something else?

1812
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,090
No, no, it was just a transmitter.

1813
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,370
Okay, yeah.

1814
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,290
We just accidentally...

1815
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:17,330
Wait, wait, we can summon items that we have had before?

1816
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:18,610
I don't think so.

1817
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,310
This whole chat's not here anymore.

1818
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,190
Okay, make sure we all save.

1819
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:22,350
Nice.

1820
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:23,650
Yeah.

1821
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,750
Okay, then...

1822
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,990
This way.

1823
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:26,730
This way.

1824
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:27,610
Oh, this way.

1825
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:28,770
Yeah, yeah.

1826
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,030
You okay?

1827
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:35,690
I just hiccup...

1828
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,190
Alright.

1829
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:36,830
Screams.

1830
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:37,610
Doesn't elaborate.

1831
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,430
Alright.

1832
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,270
What about the sexy lady?

1833
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,090
Should we invite her?

1834
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,510
We're gonna transmit it to her.

1835
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:48,410
Yeah, yeah.

1836
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,130
I don't think we speak the same language.

1837
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:52,550
Insert...

1838
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:52,690
Oh.

1839
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,070
What else do we have to do?

1840
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,270
Oh, it's transmitting data?

1841
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:57,490
Okay.

1842
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,650
I put it in her butt.

1843
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,430
Um, I mean...

1844
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:00,530
Oh.

1845
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:03,150
I got her!

1846
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,010
I scored!

1847
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:04,370
I scored!

1848
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,190
I scored the woman!

1849
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,270
Oh my god, Riz!

1850
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:09,830
She's...

1851
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:10,750
She's mine!

1852
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,030
She's not with me!

1853
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,830
Wow!

1854
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:14,370
Wow!

1855
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:14,890
Miss!

1856
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,190
You Riz'd her!

1857
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:17,870
I Riz'd her!

1858
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:18,430
I said...

1859
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,230
I said...

1860
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,330
Dot, dot, dot...

1861
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,030
And she followed...

1862
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:24,050
She went silent.

1863
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:24,650
Yeah.

1864
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:25,550
Dot, dot, dot.

1865
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,350
Dot, dot, dot.

1866
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,070
Ooh!

1867
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,770
That's pretty spicy.

1868
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:31,650
Oh, she's talking.

1869
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,170
She's talking.

1870
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:33,650
Let's go there.

1871
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:34,110
Let's go there.

1872
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,110
Explore the secret passage.

1873
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:36,330
Secret passage?

1874
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:36,970
Oh!

1875
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,350
She's...

1876
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,390
She's leading us!

1877
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,810
Wait, what do we do in the wall?

1878
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:40,850
I'm gonna take this transmitter?

1879
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:41,890
I don't know.

1880
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:42,930
She has to duck.

1881
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:43,930
I think we used it.

1882
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,530
Yeah.

1883
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,730
I think you could keep it in here, probably.

1884
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:47,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1885
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:48,190
Oh.

1886
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,190
Let's follow the top...

1887
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:50,330
Look at her go.

1888
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,550
The tall, big, strong woman.

1889
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:53,790
It's a...

1890
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,930
It's a runway now.

1891
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:55,570
Yeah.

1892
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:57,570
Help!

1893
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,610
It's America's Next Top Model.

1894
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,050
Oh!

1895
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:01,730
Oh!

1896
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:02,750
No!

1897
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:03,950
Oh, she disappeared!

1898
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,890
She got sucked in!

1899
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,350
Wait, there's a monster in here, then.

1900
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:07,990
She got...

1901
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,310
There is?

1902
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,050
There's a guy right there.

1903
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:09,630
Oh, there's him!

1904
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:10,570
There's the big guy.

1905
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:13,730
Yeah.

1906
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:15,530
I'll see you.

1907
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:16,050
Be careful.

1908
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:16,910
Yeah.

1909
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:17,870
Wait, should we save right here?

1910
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,670
There's a safe place.

1911
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,350
Oh, yeah, we should.

1912
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,230
Yeah, yeah, let's see.

1913
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:20,830
Yeah, yeah.

1914
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:21,730
Come back, come back.

1915
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,330
Unless we don't see the big, strong lady again.

1916
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:25,470
We're good.

1917
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,990
We're good.

1918
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:26,710
Okay, good.

1919
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,010
Okay.

1920
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,250
It was all a dream.

1921
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,330
Oh, he's walking over here.

1922
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,370
Yeah, he's coming this way.

1923
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:32,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1924
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:33,810
He just left.

1925
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,290
Alright.

1926
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,130
I see her outside.

1927
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:37,790
Oh, she's outside?

1928
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:39,190
She's waiting for us in the rain.

1929
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:39,870
Yeah.

1930
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,550
That's so cute.

1931
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,210
Yeah, I wanna see.

1932
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,110
What?

1933
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:42,850
She wants...

1934
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,310
She wants to see her girlfriend.

1935
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:46,530
Oh, I see her.

1936
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:47,350
Yeah, she's over there.

1937
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,910
Wait, I hear something.

1938
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:51,750
Doobie, what are you looking at?

1939
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:52,550
Is that her?

1940
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:53,950
Yeah, that is her.

1941
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:54,450
What's her?

1942
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:55,190
Oh.

1943
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:56,770
He's just out there.

1944
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,210
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, he's walking around.

1945
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:58,890
Oh.

1946
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:02,230
Oh.

1947
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,570
I think we have the couch, right?

1948
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:04,070
Yeah.

1949
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:06,630
As long as he doesn't see us.

1950
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:07,970
Our anime girlfriend.

1951
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:10,650
Oh.

1952
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:11,290
Oh.

1953
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,490
Guys, I don't think Doobie lived.

1954
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:15,770
We can go save.

1955
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,260
Oh, wait.

1956
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,260
Yeah, where's Doobie?

1957
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,820
Wait, wait, wait.

1958
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,400
Not A.

1959
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,560
Not A.

1960
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:46,880
Not A.

1961
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:47,760
Not A.

1962
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,000
Not A.

1963
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,920
I think it got respawned.

1964
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,680
I thought it got a A.

1965
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:56,900
Hey!

1966
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,460
Hey, that's weird that it let us...

1967
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,320
Hey!

1968
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:09,490
I literally died the moment Nimi responded, you guys.

1969
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:10,490
Yeah!

1970
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:14,790
He's like right there.

1971
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:15,170
Hold on.

1972
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,370
Oh, yeah.

1973
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,930
He's tough.

1974
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,910
He's a big strong man.

1975
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:22,450
Whoa.

1976
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:23,150
Yeah.

1977
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,830
He's out here getting ready for basketball.

1978
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,030
Oh.

1979
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,050
He scares me.

1980
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:33,950
Alright.

1981
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,240
Shining in his eyes.

1982
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:40,220
Yeah.

1983
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,040
Yeah.

1984
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,100
He looks like an actual imposter.

1985
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,240
He looks like...oh, he looks like Slenderman.

1986
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:48,740
Yeah.

1987
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,220
Explore the hole in the wall to the outside.

1988
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,440
He does look like Slenderman.

1989
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,340
So we gotta go outside.

1990
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,000
Alright.

1991
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,180
Somehow.

1992
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,020
Oh, gosh.

1993
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,360
I think he sees one of us.

1994
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:31,410
I think he sees one of us.

1995
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,010
I have to go.

1996
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:32,810
I have to be nearby.

1997
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,910
I was a volume in the end for all everything.

1998
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,570
Is the volume okay?

1999
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,150
Okay.

2000
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:40,930
I think he can hear us.

2001
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,170
I'm back.

2002
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:42,030
Yeah.

2003
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,870
Guys, did you hear me when I said I think...

2004
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,290
Did you guys heard me when it said?

2005
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,370
Seize one of us.

2006
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,290
Did you not?

2007
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:52,110
Seize one of us.

2008
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,970
He cannot powerslide in this.

2009
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,530
Famous last words.

2010
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,810
Okay, I believe.

2011
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,860
Nimi's so brave.

2012
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,520
You go, Nimi.

2013
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:31,830
Got Nimi.

2014
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:32,630
Got Nimi.

2015
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,780
No, Chat got her!

2016
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,840
Chat got her!

2017
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,060
Oh my god!

2018
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah, look!

2019
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:44,900
I see Nimo!

2020
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,480
Can you get me?

2021
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:49,620
No!

2022
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,840
Yeah, come over!

2023
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,840
We gotta bring her back!

2024
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,480
What is that?

2025
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:58,920
Alright.

2026
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,300
Oh, oh my god.

2027
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,420
Oh my god, he was trying to get me!

2028
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,480
Wait, do you guys hear that?

2029
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,540
You hear footsteps, right?

2030
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,700
Yeah, do you guys hear that?

2031
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,920
I heard it last time, too.

2032
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:12,800
Hello.

2033
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:13,780
Okay, alright.

2034
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,160
Alright.

2035
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,680
Did you have got grabbed by Chat?

2036
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,040
No, no, it was the big guy.

2037
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:20,680
Oh, yeah.

2038
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:21,920
Oh.

2039
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,500
Oh, he's going through the wall!

2040
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,100
He's got tentacles through the wall!

2041
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,720
Wait, maybe I'll stay here and distract him.

2042
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2043
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,080
Wait, actually he went back, I think.

2044
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:32,780
Oh, no.

2045
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,160
Okay, I think, okay, I got a plan.

2046
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,960
One of us has to be bait, and then the rest just runs over.

2047
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,660
Go to the other room, you can open the door there.

2048
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,020
Yeah, yeah.

2049
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,460
Just one of us has to live.

2050
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,320
Only one of us has to live.

2051
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,360
I mean, if we all die, we just go...

2052
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,060
We spawn right back at that safe spot.

2053
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:48,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so there.

2054
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,020
Only one of us has...

2055
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,060
Okay, I feel like we have to go in the fort.

2056
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,040
Okay, no, I...

2057
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,080
Okay, Doobie, you be the hero.

2058
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,680
Go, Doobie, go!

2059
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,600
Go, Doobie, go!

2060
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,250
Okay, I don't think she...

2061
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:07,550
Okay, yeah.

2062
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:17,970
Oh!

2063
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,330
Hello?

2064
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:37,230
Hello?

2065
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:37,730
Hey?

2066
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:37,870
Hey.

2067
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:39,690
Oh, hey, guys.

2068
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:40,390
We all live.

2069
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:42,410
Yeah, but...

2070
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,090
Where do we go?

2071
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,030
Where do we go?

2072
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:44,690
Yeah.

2073
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,210
It says we're supposed to go outside, but...

2074
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,350
It's a little maze.

2075
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,830
There's supposed to...

2076
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,150
There's supposedly a map.

2077
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,250
Oh, he's over there.

2078
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:54,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2079
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,690
It's like a little maze.

2080
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,980
Oh, you can go through stuff here!

2081
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:04,980
Oh, I found it!

2082
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:05,480
I found it!

2083
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:11,850
I'm outside!

2084
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,750
Oh, God.

2085
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,430
Don't go outside.

2086
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:22,190
There's...

2087
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,030
No, there's...

2088
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,590
There's something in there.

2089
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,950
There's...

2090
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:25,170
There's...

2091
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,730
There's a monster in front of us.

2092
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:31,930
Okay.

2093
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:32,390
Get in.

2094
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,210
I don't know where to...

2095
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,770
Let me be a hero!

2096
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,410
I'll be a hero!

2097
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,110
Let me just go!

2098
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:42,710
Just go!

2099
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,090
Okay, just go!

2100
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:47,490
Just go!

2101
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:47,730
Wait!

2102
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:48,310
Oh, he's gone.

2103
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:48,730
He's gone.

2104
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:49,170
We're fine.

2105
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,930
Where do I go?

2106
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,030
Where do I go?

2107
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,700
Can anyone see me?

2108
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,710
Why?!

2109
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,710
How did she live?!

2110
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:55,130
I...

2111
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:57,550
I didn't...

2112
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,310
I didn't need to live!

2113
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,430
Wait, is this the third floor?

2114
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,230
Oh, he's here!

2115
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,040
How many?

2116
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,960
Is there a save room?

2117
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:32,680
Save!

2118
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,640
Oh, no!

2119
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,740
Nimi doesn't know where the save is!

2120
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,700
I don't know how to turn off the flashlight!

2121
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:44,920
I...

2122
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:58,500
Nimi!

2123
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,120
How did you live?!

2124
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,520
You were the chosen one!

2125
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,320
You were the chosen one!

2126
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,160
Oh, I think it's open...

2127
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:06,220
That was so scary!

2128
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,220
Oh, I know it didn't save.

2129
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,400
We didn't save it.

2130
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,320
I don't...

2131
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,920
But I don't think we need that door as long.

2132
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,940
We know how to go outside.

2133
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,540
That's true.

2134
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:14,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2135
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,060
I think it would be good to open it, though.

2136
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:16,780
Just in case.

2137
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,400
All right, okay, okay, so...

2138
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,220
All right.

2139
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,580
So, all DBS has to do is lure him again, and then one of us opens the door.

2140
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:27,580
Okay, I think I've improved my luring...

2141
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,480
Uh...

2142
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:29,840
Skill.

2143
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:30,480
Yeah.

2144
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,680
Oh, everybody...

2145
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,180
If you...

2146
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,500
All right, I got the door!

2147
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,080
All right, we just gotta save.

2148
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:44,900
In this room, see?

2149
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:45,660
Yeah.

2150
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,280
All right, when we save, we can save Doobie.

2151
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,620
Yeah, yeah, let's save Doobie.

2152
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:50,860
Yeah.

2153
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,620
All right, we know how to go outside now.

2154
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,360
Yeah, yeah, we know.

2155
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,960
Okay, so Nia, where the fuck did you go, Nia and me?

2156
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,900
Like, how did you live?

2157
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,380
I couldn't find the...

2158
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,060
I couldn't find the...

2159
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,440
The third floor.

2160
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:08,660
Oh, he's...

2161
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:09,520
Oh, wait, we can go first.

2162
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,980
I don't know where to go, so I'll let you guys go.

2163
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,700
Yeah, it's like forward and right.

2164
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:30,310
I made it.

2165
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,190
Okay, who died?

2166
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:36,830
I think so.

2167
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:39,710
Guys, there was always three of us, right?

2168
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:40,990
Uh-oh.

2169
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,510
The other thing is there.

2170
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,150
It's okay.

2171
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,790
I think Nimi went forward from here and then...

2172
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,150
Yeah, yeah, I don't know where she went.

2173
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,070
Oh, she's the only one that knew where to go.

2174
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:53,330
Yeah, she was.

2175
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,070
She was the only one.

2176
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:55,770
Uh-oh.

2177
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:57,130
Uh-oh.

2178
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,330
Yeah, but that thing was not like...

2179
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:00,290
It didn't kill us.

2180
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:02,550
Yeah, see?

2181
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,810
It probably will if it catches up to you.

2182
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:04,730
Oh, God.

2183
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,390
Yeah, see?

2184
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:06,230
He's just friendly.

2185
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:07,950
Oh, we found it.

2186
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:08,210
Nice.

2187
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:10,850
Good job, Doobie.

2188
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:11,630
Good job, Doobie.

2189
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,910
There's a guy right here, though.

2190
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:13,710
He's right here.

2191
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:15,270
Just run, just run, just run, run!

2192
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:15,970
He'll kill one of us!

2193
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,830
He'll only kill one of us!

2194
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:17,990
He'll kill me!

2195
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,500
We all made it, guys!

2196
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,300
We all made it!

2197
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,060
There were the little inky guys in here.

2198
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,580
Guys, we all made it!

2199
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:36,880
We all...

2200
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,200
Let's just find a save point.

2201
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:38,980
Yeah.

2202
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,320
Ow!

2203
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,540
There's a really loud sound in here!

2204
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,040
I can't remember.

2205
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,220
Yeah, I knew it.

2206
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,500
It's me.

2207
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,180
I'm dead.

2208
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,040
I'm dead.

2209
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,700
Goodbye, world!

2210
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,400
Goodbye!

2211
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,480
Goodbye, world!

2212
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,000
Don't lock me out.

2213
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,740
Where's Doobie, though?

2214
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,060
Where's Doobie?

2215
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,280
Oh, wait!

2216
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,540
Doobie found a save point!

2217
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,820
She found a save point!

2218
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,420
She found a save point!

2219
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:04,580
She found a save point!

2220
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,820
She's trying...

2221
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,320
She's trying to save!

2222
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,740
She's trying so hard to save!

2223
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,300
Where are you, Doobie?

2224
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:14,980
Doobie!

2225
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:15,780
Doobie!

2226
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,240
Doobie, why?

2227
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,160
Doobie, we don't know where the save is!

2228
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:22,960
Where is she?

2229
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,920
Maybe in the computer room.

2230
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,420
I'm gonna...

2231
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,040
Are you guys alive?

2232
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,860
Yeah, yeah.

2233
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,380
We saw you spamming the save.

2234
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,490
Save right here.

2235
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,510
Save, save, save.

2236
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,310
Yay, you're back.

2237
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:41,940
I got too many.

2238
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,300
When you're scared, we start forgetting.

2239
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,960
Oh, there's a gun.

2240
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,300
Oh, wait, that's how you remove this?

2241
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,020
Someone said, it said... There's a... There's a... Let's chat.

2242
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:57,720
Oh, hey.

2243
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:58,460
TV head.

2244
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,480
Oh, it's a friendly.

2245
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,340
Who are you?

2246
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,060
I'm a TV head.

2247
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,580
I don't think he's friendly.

2248
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,720
Sometimes I want to... an orange to replace.

2249
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,740
Oh, he wants an orange.

2250
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:07,400
Oh, nice.

2251
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:15,870
Signals on... To do this, the brightness of the monitors need to be changed.

2252
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,250
Okay.

2253
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,690
Don't make chat angry.

2254
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,230
Oh, this mon... These?

2255
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:26,890
Why did they send me here?

2256
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,810
I saw a monitor.

2257
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:30,610
I picked one up.

2258
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:33,250
They said we gotta, like, make it match.

2259
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,190
You guys have... Does anybody else have a monitor?

2260
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:41,690
Uh... No, I don't have another one.

2261
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:43,510
I saw one.

2262
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:45,710
Um, in another room where we hid.

2263
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:46,970
Oh, yeah.

2264
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:47,830
I remember that.

2265
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:48,150
Yeah.

2266
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:49,890
Let's head over.

2267
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,870
It's, like, right over here.

2268
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:01,770
Yeah.

2269
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,090
See?

2270
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,070
That should be it.

2271
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,190
Yeah, we have to remove it.

2272
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,690
Just want to make sure there's... nothing.

2273
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,510
I found the...

2274
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,350
I found another way.

2275
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,190
Like, a little...

2276
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,290
hallway with a door.

2277
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,770
There's a monster outside, apparently.

2278
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,420
Wait, what else do I have to do next?

2279
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,200
Wait, did you place the monitor?

2280
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,020
I didn't have a monitor.

2281
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,000
Wait, do we have?

2282
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:47,400
I have a monitor.

2283
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,280
Oh, hey, right here, right here.

2284
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:48,900
Wait, where do I place it?

2285
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,420
Right here.

2286
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:54,330
Okay.

2287
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:56,890
What?

2288
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:57,990
Oh, gosh.

2289
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,190
Wait, it is the cat.

2290
01:19:59,350 --> 01:19:59,990
There he is.

2291
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:04,310
It's coming our way.

2292
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:04,730
It's okay.

2293
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:05,590
He doesn't kill you.

2294
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:06,850
See?

2295
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,390
It's, like, a little ride.

2296
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,050
Oh, guys, I don't think this monitor matches.

2297
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:22,190
Wait, how do we solve this puzzle?

2298
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:25,690
A wall of black liquid.

2299
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,610
There is, like, a...

2300
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,990
I found a hole somewhere.

2301
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:30,950
Like...

2302
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:31,890
Wait, follow me, guys.

2303
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:33,390
There's a hole with a monster.

2304
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,830
A hole with a monster.

2305
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:36,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2306
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:36,990
Wait, what's this?

2307
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:39,590
Green electrical.

2308
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,250
Where the fuck does this go?

2309
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:42,270
No, um...

2310
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:46,030
There was a red line, like, at the very beginning where we were in the stairwell.

2311
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:46,730
Oh!

2312
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,590
Can we just put it...

2313
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,590
Can we just put this in here?

2314
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:51,810
Oh, we can't.

2315
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:53,710
No, that's the trading machine.

2316
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:54,770
Okay, so...

2317
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:55,010
Yeah.

2318
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,450
We have to hold on to this, then.

2319
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,210
Okay, I found, like...

2320
01:20:59,210 --> 01:20:59,790
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2321
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,570
Follow me, guys.

2322
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:01,790
There's a little hole...

2323
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:02,750
With a...

2324
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,430
With a monster.

2325
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:05,470
But, like, I think it's the next area.

2326
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,970
I'm gonna check the red line.

2327
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:09,990
Alright.

2328
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:10,470
Okay.

2329
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:16,210
Did you just sit?

2330
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:18,630
I'm so scared.

2331
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:20,250
You sat down.

2332
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,140
Guys, I need a moment.

2333
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,660
I need a moment.

2334
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,280
Uh-oh.

2335
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:33,900
Um...

2336
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:34,920
Okay, I'm sorry.

2337
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,220
Look at the goo monster.

2338
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,540
I don't care.

2339
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,320
I just need a moment.

2340
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,720
What is this?

2341
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:48,760
Oh, nice.

2342
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:49,440
Power's on.

2343
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,540
We did it.

2344
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,200
We gotta go revive, doobie.

2345
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,200
Oh, the doobie died?

2346
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,480
Oh, we got the monitor!

2347
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:03,660
Five!

2348
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,320
Whoa!

2349
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,500
Oh, there's the puzzle!

2350
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,500
We're gonna get a gun once we...

2351
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,340
Okay, it's...

2352
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:14,500
That...

2353
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,820
Wait, how do you turn it gray?

2354
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,040
Yeah?

2355
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:20,820
Come, we've revived doobie.

2356
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:21,600
Alright.

2357
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:22,200
There we go.

2358
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:22,480
Hello!

2359
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,140
I'll come back.

2360
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,580
Alright, we gotta do this.

2361
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:27,740
Oh...

2362
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,860
One, two, three, four, five.

2363
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,560
I got the left side.

2364
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:31,900
I got the left side.

2365
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:32,240
Oh...

2366
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:33,900
Oh...

2367
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,440
What do you mean?

2368
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:34,920
What is it?

2369
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:35,600
Okay.

2370
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:36,460
Computers?

2371
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:37,120
Yeah.

2372
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,200
Yeah, if you turn one off, some of them turn...

2373
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,260
I got the left side, and he went to do the right.

2374
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:42,920
Yeah.

2375
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,560
Oh, this is the gray.

2376
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,140
We got it!

2377
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,380
We did?

2378
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,080
No.

2379
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:53,160
Yeah.

2380
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,120
Oh.

2381
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:55,900
Uh...

2382
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,760
Gray, gray...

2383
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:56,980
Wait.

2384
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,200
Isn't that not correct?

2385
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,220
Oh, wait.

2386
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,180
No, this has to be white.

2387
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:02,780
Oh...

2388
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,900
What if I do this?

2389
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,380
This is...

2390
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,240
No, no, no, no, no.

2391
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,440
I thought they were all supposed to be on.

2392
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,940
Oh, it's different colors!

2393
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2394
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,900
And then this should be black.

2395
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,340
Yeah, he's funny looking.

2396
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,280
And then...

2397
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:17,500
Hello.

2398
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:18,820
Hint to the puzzle?

2399
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,220
Oh, he'll give us a hint!

2400
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,600
Oh, nice!

2401
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,340
Wait, what?

2402
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:24,640
Hmm...

2403
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,020
Here we go.

2404
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:25,980
I think...

2405
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:26,620
Oh, gosh.

2406
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:27,560
You need to...

2407
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,340
It just says you need to match it.

2408
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,260
Singles...

2409
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:33,910
Okay.

2410
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:36,750
They're like, you just gotta match it.

2411
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:38,210
Wait a minute.

2412
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:38,890
Oh!

2413
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,350
We have to follow the line!

2414
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,210
Each line corresponds to a square!

2415
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,110
So this one is...

2416
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,250
Okay, this one's correct.

2417
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:55,370
Is it?

2418
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:56,370
I don't...

2419
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:59,510
I don't even correspond...

2420
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:00,150
Yeah.

2421
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:01,930
Check the line.

2422
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:03,810
I'm checking the line.

2423
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:05,690
The first computer is good.

2424
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:08,390
Which computer is this one?

2425
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,280
We're missing the second one.

2426
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,800
Yeah, it's a lot of lines.

2427
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,280
Is this correct?

2428
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:24,340
Okay.

2429
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,260
Okay.

2430
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,040
We got this one correct.

2431
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:28,980
Oh?

2432
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:29,500
Okay.

2433
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:33,640
Oh!

2434
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,040
Okay!

2435
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,440
I figured it out.

2436
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,240
I figured it out.

2437
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:40,300
Um...

2438
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:40,560
Wait, wait.

2439
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,020
Are you pressing the buttons on it?

2440
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:43,940
Wait.

2441
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,360
Uh...

2442
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,800
I can put it back to what it was before.

2443
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:46,080
Sorry.

2444
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,200
Can you do that monitor on the right side?

2445
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,380
And I'll tell you if it's correct or not.

2446
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:50,940
Okay, this one?

2447
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:51,580
Yeah.

2448
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:53,720
Keep pressing.

2449
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,240
Yeah, there you go.

2450
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:55,820
Next one.

2451
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,140
Huh?

2452
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:00,360
Wait, can you keep pressing?

2453
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:02,460
Yeah.

2454
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,260
Next one.

2455
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:04,840
Okay.

2456
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,320
Yeah.

2457
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,260
Next one.

2458
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,040
Yep.

2459
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:10,680
Next one.

2460
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,160
Oh!

2461
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:12,940
Keep pressing.

2462
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:15,820
Keep pressing.

2463
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,220
Yep.

2464
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:17,580
Next.

2465
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,260
Yeah.

2466
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,640
Okay, we're missing one more.

2467
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,800
I guess it's the one on this side.

2468
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,880
Oh, there we go.

2469
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:25,340
There we go.

2470
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,020
We did it!

2471
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:26,480
Yay!

2472
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,140
We're the smart.

2473
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,020
We're the smart.

2474
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:31,640
How does it...

2475
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:31,980
Oh, yeah.

2476
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:33,880
Oh.

2477
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:34,980
Oh.

2478
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:35,660
There's no fire.

2479
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:36,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2480
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,060
The shadows.

2481
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,520
We're the smart blondes.

2482
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,200
Wait, I can get one too!

2483
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,080
Oh, nice!

2484
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,340
Oh, no, I think the only one...

2485
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:42,840
We did it!

2486
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:43,700
You see?

2487
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,360
Wait, should we save?

2488
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:45,840
Let's save.

2489
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,120
Oh, yeah.

2490
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:46,480
Let's save.

2491
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,460
Let's save.

2492
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,600
Yeah, we're the smart blondes.

2493
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:55,760
Yeah.

2494
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,500
The greens were just...

2495
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,620
Where'd you guys go?

2496
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,920
We're the greens were just...

2497
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,360
I'm not even wearing this.

2498
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,580
We're getting back away as we found our electrical box!

2499
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,400
I heard you giggled...

2500
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,320
Yeah, I heard you giggled...

2501
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:06,720
Yeah, that's right!

2502
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,360
Where!

2503
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:10,680
Oh, yeah.

2504
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:12,360
Oh, yeah.

2505
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,680
Nah, they don't...

2506
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,380
They can't be shot.

2507
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:15,980
Alright, let's go.

2508
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:16,880
Maybe they're tamed.

2509
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,260
They're like, uh, domesticated.

2510
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,820
Yeah, domesticated chat.

2511
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,700
You're well behaved now.

2512
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,540
Yeah, we're well behaved.

2513
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,160
There's an electrical box on the roof up there.

2514
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,580
Oh yeah, okay.

2515
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,040
I know how to get there.

2516
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,420
I know how to get there, but I want to shoot the shadows first.

2517
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,080
Okay.

2518
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,340
It's over here.

2519
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,220
It's less scary when there's like, you know...

2520
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,740
When there's light.

2521
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:46,700
Yeah!

2522
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,480
We did it!

2523
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,280
Wow, that actually worked!

2524
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,120
Okay, but here, follow me.

2525
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,360
There's like another... Look.

2526
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,420
Follow me.

2527
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:54,700
Yeah, yeah.

2528
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,260
Wait, did you get the goo?

2529
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2530
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,100
Come here.

2531
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,720
Oh, wait, wait, no.

2532
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,400
This goes into the classroom.

2533
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,460
Wait, here, here, here.

2534
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:01,740
This one.

2535
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,480
This guy.

2536
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,160
This guy.

2537
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,240
There's something evil out there.

2538
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,440
Yeah, that's what I saw.

2539
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,140
I can't shoot him.

2540
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:10,800
Did that work?

2541
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,360
No.

2542
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,560
I don't know what...

2543
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,820
Oh, it's just for the wall, right?

2544
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:17,280
I don't know what this is for though, because...

2545
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:17,820
There he goes.

2546
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:20,820
Oh, he just jumped the other room.

2547
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,880
I don't know what this is for.

2548
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,980
Because our objective is...

2549
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:24,160
It's for the wall.

2550
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,080
Didn't we get the wall?

2551
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:26,560
Yeah, no, no, the wall.

2552
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,420
No, that's not the wall.

2553
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,800
The wall's behind us.

2554
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,040
Whoa!

2555
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,880
Alright, well, let's go back.

2556
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,700
Yeah, I'm going back.

2557
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,060
Yeah, he's a little dangerous.

2558
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,740
Do we have a wall too?

2559
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,200
Yeah, we have...

2560
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's over here.

2561
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:40,920
Yeah.

2562
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:42,060
Right here.

2563
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,220
Doobie, doobie, doobie.

2564
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:43,940
This is it.

2565
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:44,900
We're the next guy.

2566
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:45,580
Yeah, yeah.

2567
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,520
We'll do that.

2568
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,340
We'll do that for...

2569
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:47,740
Oh,

2570
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,590
okay.

2571
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:53,570
Okay, so that's the...

2572
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:54,250
I got an achievement.

2573
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:55,590
Meet the monster on...

2574
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:02,490
Guys, I think...

2575
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:03,910
I think Min met the monster.

2576
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:05,610
I think Min met the monster.

2577
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,110
I think she...

2578
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,600
I think I can hear us.

2579
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,620
I did not.

2580
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,900
Are we safe?

2581
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:22,820
Do you think?

2582
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,100
Are we safe?

2583
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:26,980
It's coming back.

2584
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:30,160
Oh...

2585
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,040
It's just turning around.

2586
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,060
I don't think I can keep coming in here, right?

2587
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:37,800
I don't think so.

2588
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:38,640
I think he's too thick.

2589
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:40,940
Oh, I closed...

2590
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:41,500
Yeah, he's too thick.

2591
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,240
I closed the door.

2592
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:43,340
Okay.

2593
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,300
Did Nimi make it?

2594
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,180
I don't know if Nimi made it.

2595
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,680
I know Min's definitely dead.

2596
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,680
I know she's dead dead.

2597
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,880
I saw them both get run over.

2598
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,100
Like, they both got hit with a bus.

2599
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,540
Oh, okay, so we have to, like, run past it when he...

2600
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,980
Okay, I'll go on the other side.

2601
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2602
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:12,540
Okay,

2603
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:22,150
when he does the loop, we run.

2604
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:26,250
We have to wait for him to do the loop.

2605
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,800
Okay, go, go, go, go!

2606
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,920
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2607
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,280
Doobie?

2608
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,920
Did Doobie go?

2609
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:13,750
Oh my god, Doobie's going the other way.

2610
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,790
Doobie, why?

2611
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:17,230
Why, Doobie, you'll never make it!

2612
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,890
Oh.

2613
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:19,230
Oh my god.

2614
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,170
Oh my god.

2615
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,230
Wait, Doobie made it!

2616
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,350
Doobie made it!

2617
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:28,450
Can't see, it's too dark.

2618
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:31,210
Doobie made it!

2619
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:31,210
Oh,

2620
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,770
radio.

2621
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:37,950
Hello?

2622
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,700
What is Doobie doing?

2623
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,260
I wonder if this is useful.

2624
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,510
What about, wait?

2625
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,170
I can't hear the ghost.

2626
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,810
Yay, that's my radio!

2627
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:04,110
How do I make it so I can hear you guys?

2628
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:04,810
Is everybody dead?

2629
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:08,910
Oh, I'm back!

2630
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:09,550
Yay!

2631
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:10,970
Okay.

2632
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:12,910
Okay, so...

2633
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:18,870
He does turn around, he turns around.

2634
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:20,190
I found out.

2635
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:20,390
He does?

2636
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:23,910
Yeah, so we have to let him run a little bit and then...

2637
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:25,590
Oh, you can have the gun.

2638
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:26,950
Nah, it's okay.

2639
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,610
Alright, and then like, and then run.

2640
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:32,110
I was wondering how you died.

2641
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:33,650
I found Doobie for two seconds.

2642
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:34,490
I know, me too!

2643
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:35,930
Yeah, he turns around.

2644
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,630
I think we can run from here, right?

2645
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:39,650
Maybe?

2646
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,390
I just wait until he turns the corner.

2647
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:42,210
Yeah.

2648
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:43,130
Okay.

2649
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:45,970
I'll wait for a little bit.

2650
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:46,810
I'm just so loud.

2651
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:51,810
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2652
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,230
Run, go, go, go, go, go!

2653
01:31:55,870 --> 01:31:56,490
The door.

2654
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:56,730
The door!

2655
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:57,370
The the door!

2656
01:31:59,190 --> 01:31:59,430
We're okay.

2657
01:31:59,550 --> 01:31:59,950
We're safe here.

2658
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:00,430
We're safe here.

2659
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,150
Doobie?!

2660
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:02,750
Where's Doobie?

2661
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:03,570
Wait.

2662
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:05,510
Where's Doobie?

2663
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,650
Oh, Doobie called Antzou.

2664
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:07,770
I hear!

2665
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:08,670
Nice!

2666
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:09,830
Hello!

2667
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:10,090
Okay.

2668
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:14,090
Oh, complete the... on the third floor.

2669
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:14,450
Wait.

2670
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:16,950
The one on the wall is over here.

2671
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:18,630
Wait, there's a hole, there's a hole, there's a hole!

2672
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,170
Wait, what is this?

2673
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:35,410
Wait, what?

2674
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,030
Come shoot the goo.

2675
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,450
Wait, where?

2676
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:41,890
It's... Where is it?

2677
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:44,190
Right here, right here.

2678
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:44,890
Where is it?

2679
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:45,330
Oh.

2680
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:48,090
Wait, where?

2681
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:50,070
I don't see a goo anywhere.

2682
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,490
No, no, no.

2683
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:53,610
Out here, out here, out here.

2684
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:53,850
Oh.

2685
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:56,210
Wait, wait, wait.

2686
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:56,810
Show me.

2687
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:57,390
Right here.

2688
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:58,650
Wait, behind you.

2689
01:32:58,950 --> 01:32:59,290
There you go.

2690
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:00,470
There you go.

2691
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:01,130
All through the window.

2692
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:03,610
Through the window, through the wall.

2693
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,970
Where was the electrical box?

2694
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:08,130
Didn't we see one earlier?

2695
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:08,990
Yeah, we did.

2696
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:11,730
Did we use it for something?

2697
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:12,730
Is that the exit?

2698
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,700
Guys, I don't think we'll never find the moon, guys.

2699
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,000
We're...

2700
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,540
Okay, we have to go forward then?

2701
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,680
I feel like we're making great progress.

2702
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:30,660
Yeah.

2703
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:32,180
Alright.

2704
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,420
Still not at the moon.

2705
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:36,660
Oh, oh, wait, I can... we can open this door.

2706
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:42,400
Oh, wait, it's closed on the other side.

2707
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:44,400
Oh, this is open this.

2708
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,060
Oh, guys, I need someone to open that door.

2709
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,420
Yeah, I got it.

2710
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:49,020
Woohoo!

2711
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:49,800
Ah!

2712
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:12,740
We have that!

2713
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,600
I was like, yay, guys!

2714
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,720
We were gonna open the door, everyone!

2715
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:18,800
Oh my God.

2716
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:19,840
I was

2717
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:30,810
like, we

2718
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:35,600
did it!

2719
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:36,600
Okay, I'm waiting for the loot.

2720
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,760
I think we're too late.

2721
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:38,800
I think we're too late.

2722
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,760
Okay, okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2723
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,260
Okay, someone else open that door.

2724
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,040
Someone else open it.

2725
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:52,860
I got it.

2726
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,040
Okay, okay, we got the door, we got the door.

2727
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:57,460
Okay.

2728
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:58,080
Alright.

2729
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,900
Careful, don't get run over.

2730
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:01,640
The door's open.

2731
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:02,620
I'm not, I'm not!

2732
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,900
Alright, get the electrical panel.

2733
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:05,600
We'll wait here.

2734
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:06,860
Okay.

2735
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,040
Okay.

2736
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,660
I wish we could observe her when she's alive.

2737
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:14,180
Yeah!

2738
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,880
Where would this...

2739
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,940
Okay, we gotta figure out a link.

2740
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,100
Oh, wait, we have to put it here.

2741
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:19,840
Oh, she found it.

2742
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,520
Vince found it.

2743
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:20,880
Yeah.

2744
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,980
She's gonna go get it right now.

2745
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,940
Yeah, so then we're missing two after that.

2746
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,520
Oh, okay.

2747
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,080
What is this, anyway?

2748
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,780
It's, uh, the electrical circuit.

2749
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:31,500
The generator?

2750
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:32,100
Yeah.

2751
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,140
Maybe we put the electricity.

2752
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,280
We have to go down.

2753
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,360
Oh, wait, we can't go down.

2754
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:40,380
Nice.

2755
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,260
Alright, now we're just...

2756
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:44,920
Maybe we go left side.

2757
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,260
Oh, remember that...

2758
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:50,940
Remember that giant guy that was jumping earlier?

2759
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,520
I'm going forward.

2760
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,320
Okay, we found another.

2761
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,300
Oh, that's scary.

2762
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,600
I don't like the sounds, guys.

2763
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:24,010
Hey, guys.

2764
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:27,430
I'm on the other side.

2765
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:33,390
I'm trying to see if there's, like, any, uh, electrical circuits here.

2766
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:35,970
I kept running.

2767
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,120
Okay, okay.

2768
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,560
Who tried to bait him earlier?

2769
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,960
I know one of you guys tried to bait him.

2770
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,230
Wait, is Doobie alive?

2771
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,430
Did she live?

2772
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,210
Wait, where's Doobie?

2773
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,080
Oh, no.

2774
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,260
Oh, no.

2775
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,740
Oh, no.

2776
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:22,320
Oh, no.

2777
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,460
Oh, no.

2778
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,540
Oh, no.

2779
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:29,280
He got me from inside!

2780
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,930
I'm so sad.

2781
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,350
Anybody?

2782
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:43,530
Anybody?

2783
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:45,170
Hello?

2784
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:45,390
Hello?

2785
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,590
Oh, no!

2786
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,740
Just knee me.

2787
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,380
Only knee me.

2788
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,180
Can you tell me she's dead?

2789
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,340
The gun is right later?

2790
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,820
Oh, hey, the light works!

2791
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:18,920
Oh, hey!

2792
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,700
You have to go all the way back for that safe point.

2793
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,020
Where's the safe point?

2794
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,440
I can't do this on my own!

2795
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:34,520
I can't do this on my own!

2796
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,180
Be a hero, D.V.

2797
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,280
It's time to be a hero.

2798
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:43,760
Oh!

2799
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,540
You're a hero!

2800
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,260
You did it!

2801
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:49,440
You did it!

2802
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,640
You did it!

2803
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:54,580
Where are we?

2804
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,100
Where are we?

2805
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:58,360
Where are we?

2806
01:38:58,540 --> 01:38:59,520
Where is this place?

2807
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,580
How did you get here?

2808
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:06,090
Oh, wait!

2809
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:09,590
I think this is where the guy crashed through the wall from.

2810
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:12,270
Okay, we're still- Oh, I found a circuit!

2811
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:12,830
Guys, guys!

2812
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:14,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2813
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:16,710
Alright, we need to find one more circuit area.

2814
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,710
I have- Someone take it!

2815
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:20,250
I only have guns!

2816
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:23,510
I have a monster that was hiding, and the building is lurking on the- Oh!

2817
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:28,430
I only have, um, I only have, uh, I can't pick it up because I have a gun.

2818
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:29,690
Oh, sorry!

2819
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,290
Someone else has to pick- Oh!

2820
01:39:32,290 --> 01:39:32,710
I got it!

2821
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:33,310
I got it!

2822
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:37,510
Alright, we gotta figure out where this goes.

2823
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:47,270
Wait.

2824
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:48,790
Wait.

2825
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:49,450
I'm safe here!

2826
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:53,670
I'm safe here!

2827
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:56,510
It's safe here!

2828
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:58,310
Uh, is it here?

2829
01:39:58,450 --> 01:39:58,970
No, no, no.

2830
01:39:59,130 --> 01:39:59,670
This is the door.

2831
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:02,450
So we have to find- Oh, okay.

2832
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:03,310
Where to put the green.

2833
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:04,750
Okay.

2834
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:06,830
We gotta make- wait for him to loop again.

2835
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,750
Yeah.

2836
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:10,110
Okay, and then make sure he doesn't turn around.

2837
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:10,990
Turn around.

2838
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:14,270
Yeah, we gotta turn around and fucking ate Doobie.

2839
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:14,550
Go!

2840
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:15,130
Go!

2841
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,270
Go!

2842
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,930
In here?

2843
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:17,510
Maybe.

2844
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:20,730
I don't- I don't think I saw one in here, but maybe- I mean, we could crouch here.

2845
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:28,450
Phil.

2846
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:29,990
Where the fuck is the line?

2847
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:32,010
There's a line here.

2848
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:33,690
Let me in.

2849
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,150
Let me in.

2850
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:35,110
He's gonna turn around again.

2851
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,650
There's no line- I don't see a box here.

2852
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:39,810
I don't either.

2853
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:40,850
I don't want to go straight.

2854
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:43,090
Alright.

2855
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,950
Find the line.

2856
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,270
Is there another line here?

2857
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:52,310
No, it keeps going.

2858
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:54,030
Okay.

2859
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,110
So we'll wait here.

2860
01:40:55,610 --> 01:40:56,630
I can wait.

2861
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,870
Okay, let's go.

2862
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:09,300
Where's the line?

2863
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,180
Oh, it's over here.

2864
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,300
I see the line.

2865
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:12,980
I see the line.

2866
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:14,680
Oh.

2867
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:14,740
Oh.

2868
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:15,860
What is this?

2869
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:16,960
Is this Doobie?

2870
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,880
Is this- Oh, it's Doobie.

2871
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:20,440
Wait.

2872
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,140
Wait.

2873
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,500
What happened to me?

2874
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:22,960
Wait.

2875
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,920
What happened to me?

2876
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:24,800
Wait.

2877
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,000
Can we respawn them?

2878
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:26,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2879
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,100
Let's see.

2880
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:28,100
Oh, oh, okay.

2881
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,340
Yeah, respawn Doobie.

2882
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:29,900
Yeah.

2883
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,520
I know where the box is.

2884
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:32,820
Thank you.

2885
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:33,320
Okay, okay.

2886
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:34,800
Okay, okay.

2887
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,980
Okay, okay.

2888
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,360
Okay, we're following.

2889
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,580
Go, go, go.

2890
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:39,720
Maybe not wait here.

2891
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:41,560
Oh, I got it!

2892
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:43,020
Oh, there's- Did I wait?

2893
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:43,820
Yeah, yeah.

2894
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:44,560
I think it'll loop.

2895
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,000
It's gonna loop soon.

2896
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,480
This is one electrical box.

2897
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:51,180
Okay, I think- Remember that giant jumping thing all the way over there?

2898
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:52,200
Yeah.

2899
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:52,880
On the part, right?

2900
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,760
I think that's where the last green box is.

2901
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:55,760
It probably is.

2902
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,700
Yeah, so I had to go back.

2903
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:57,620
Wait, let's save real quick.

2904
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,540
Let's save real quick since we're in the box.

2905
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:59,100
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2906
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,140
We just did that one, yeah.

2907
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,200
Yeah, yeah.

2908
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,400
Yeah, that's a good idea.

2909
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:03,960
Okay.

2910
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:04,540
Nice.

2911
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,080
We're gonna see the moon, guys!

2912
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:09,500
We're gonna save the moon!

2913
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,240
No moon!

2914
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:11,460
Alright.

2915
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,860
How does this lead to a rocket?

2916
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:14,760
Oh my god.

2917
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:15,260
Oh my god.

2918
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,520
It's gonna lead us to a rocket.

2919
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:17,700
Alright.

2920
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,260
We're gonna go to space with our- Yeah.

2921
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:23,980
I'm going.

2922
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,320
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

2923
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,140
I'm gonna run into the safe spot.

2924
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:30,360
Safe point.

2925
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,840
Alright, I feel very safe in here.

2926
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,000
Yeah, put on some gems, Doobie!

2927
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:44,360
It's dead!

2928
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:48,780
It's dead!

2929
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,200
Because we're a team!

2930
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:00,380
We all run out!

2931
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:03,980
Doobie let him turn around with all the guys!

2932
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,760
I think, like, the collision of your body is...

2933
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,560
Because I didn't go outside.

2934
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,640
When a collision hit you!

2935
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,520
Okay, now go, go, go, go!

2936
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:18,280
Go, go, go, go!

2937
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,860
We're all fucking lemons, yeah!

2938
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,720
Yeah, the 4 for 1 sale.

2939
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,320
There we go, there we go.

2940
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:27,580
Okay, okay.

2941
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,960
4 for 1 sale.

2942
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,860
5, 1, get 3, 3, 3.

2943
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,480
Go, go, go, go!

2944
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,540
We're gonna make it!

2945
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:35,980
Oh my gosh.

2946
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:38,200
We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it!

2947
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:39,680
We're gonna make it!

2948
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:39,900
We're gonna make it!

2949
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:40,200
We're gonna make it!

2950
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:41,740
We're gonna make it!

2951
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,100
We're gonna make it!

2952
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,880
Guys, I don't think...

2953
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,640
I don't think you need...

2954
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:50,080
Guys, don't worry, we can clone it!

2955
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,620
We can doobie 19!

2956
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,900
The last green circuit is here.

2957
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,480
Wait, what if the radio is the key?

2958
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:13,540
I don't think the radio is the key, guys, I... Oh, that's true, that's true.

2959
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:19,160
Wait, but there wasn't... She died because of the radio.

2960
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:23,400
What if, what if the sound distracts you?

2961
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,180
Alright, do it.

2962
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,320
Oh, he ran away.

2963
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,080
He walked away.

2964
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:31,780
Alright, I feel like we shouldn't stick close together.

2965
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:32,980
Oh.

2966
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:35,460
Sounds like a cat.

2967
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,540
Sounds like that cat that goes like, that's eating.

2968
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,240
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

2969
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:41,740
Meow, meow.

2970
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:41,760
Meow, meow.

2971
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,120
I don't want to die again.

2972
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:43,900
I don't want to die.

2973
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:46,560
Alright, well, we can't stick together because we got...

2974
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,520
I don't think he sees us.

2975
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,240
Mint, you're fine.

2976
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:53,140
He didn't see us.

2977
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,340
Be a hero, Mint.

2978
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:57,440
Meow, meow, meow.

2979
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,900
Meow, meow, meow.

2980
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:08,860
Meow, meow, meow.

2981
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,380
Meow, meow, meow.

2982
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,720
He's gonna jump soon.

2983
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:14,040
I know,

2984
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:25,520
but...

2985
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:27,800
It's fine, we're fine here.

2986
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,080
Wait, wait, we distracted him for Nimi.

2987
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,080
We distracted him for Nimi.

2988
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,240
Oh, we did not distract him for Nimi.

2989
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,000
No, she's alive.

2990
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,580
She's alive.

2991
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:37,960
She's alive.

2992
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:38,440
She's alive.

2993
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:39,240
Did she get it?

2994
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,160
She's a hero.

2995
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:41,160
I'm a hero.

2996
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:41,840
She's a hero.

2997
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:42,300
Quick.

2998
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:43,260
She's a hero.

2999
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:44,200
She's a hero.

3000
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,700
She's a hero.

3001
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:46,240
She's a hero.

3002
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,240
She's a hero.

3003
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,440
Scratch.

3004
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:47,180
Scratch.

3005
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,260
She's a hero.

3006
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:52,820
She's a hero.

3007
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:54,200
She's a hero.

3008
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:11,950
Alright, let's die.

3009
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,570
Watch the slender man come back again.

3010
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:17,210
Oh my god.

3011
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:20,270
Wait, no, man, you hold it.

3012
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:21,470
Man, you know where it is.

3013
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,110
You know where it is.

3014
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:22,950
Okay, we gotta wait for the loop.

3015
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:23,630
We gotta wait for it.

3016
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:26,210
No, no, don't be in here right now.

3017
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:28,930
Oh my god.

3018
01:46:29,970 --> 01:46:30,890
She did it.

3019
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:31,670
Crouch.

3020
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:34,210
She did it fucking crouch.

3021
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:35,990
Oh my god.

3022
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:39,010
Oh my god, does she live?

3023
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:40,170
Does she live?

3024
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,550
No, no, she's alive.

3025
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:43,130
She's alive.

3026
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:45,310
I'm alive.

3027
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,250
Oh my god.

3028
01:46:48,290 --> 01:46:48,950
Come here, come here.

3029
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:51,790
Okay, we gotta save.

3030
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:53,850
Yay!

3031
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,330
We're heroes.

3032
01:46:57,390 --> 01:47:00,010
We'll remember your sacrifices.

3033
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:02,230
For, for earth.

3034
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:03,290
Okay.

3035
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:07,390
You brought the radio.

3036
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:12,750
Oh, we did it.

3037
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:15,830
Okay, we, it's, it's all went across.

3038
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,090
Wait, how did you get here?

3039
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:18,490
We can save again.

3040
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:20,150
Oh yeah, we gotta save again.

3041
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:20,390
What?

3042
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:21,150
We should save again.

3043
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:22,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3044
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:26,630
Yeah, we should save again.

3045
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:28,550
There's a door.

3046
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:29,030
There's a door.

3047
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:30,210
Oh, we should just go this way then.

3048
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,470
Yeah.

3049
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:31,130
Yeah, yeah.

3050
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:32,330
Cause it's on the other side.

3051
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:33,650
It's on the other side, though.

3052
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:35,330
I'm gonna wait the loop.

3053
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:36,590
I'm not risking it.

3054
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:36,950
Me too.

3055
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:37,250
Yeah.

3056
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:39,290
We're smart.

3057
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:40,170
Yeah, we're a yellow team.

3058
01:47:40,970 --> 01:47:41,950
Yeah, team yellow.

3059
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:43,090
We use our brains.

3060
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:45,930
Okay, let's go.

3061
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:49,290
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3062
01:47:50,450 --> 01:47:51,270
It's the left side.

3063
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:51,990
It's the left side.

3064
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:55,230
No, it's, it's, it is...

3065
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:56,410
Okay.

3066
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:57,910
Alright, we'll see if Min lives.

3067
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:02,450
We'll see if she lives.

3068
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,170
She'll be okay.

3069
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:06,950
Yeah, she's okay.

3070
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:08,030
Okay.

3071
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:10,250
It's like...

3072
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:11,810
Right here, it's right here.

3073
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:12,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3074
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,230
Oh, nice.

3075
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:15,130
Nice, alright.

3076
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:16,850
We did it!

3077
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:18,530
We did it!

3078
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,260
We defeated the monster!

3079
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,720
We gotta go to the moon!

3080
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:24,400
Where's the moon?

3081
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,820
We gotta go see the moon!

3082
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,220
Wait, what's down here?

3083
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:28,600
Hello?

3084
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,640
Can we open this door?

3085
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:32,320
Close from the other side.

3086
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,700
No, we can't open that.

3087
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,240
Then we go down then.

3088
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:40,080
Down, down, down.

3089
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:41,400
Down, down, down.

3090
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:42,640
Oh, there's another one here!

3091
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:44,000
Oh, I see.

3092
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:44,340
River!

3093
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:47,660
Instantly.

3094
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:48,820
Oh, dynamite?

3095
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:52,240
We need dynamite here?

3096
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,460
We're that monster.

3097
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:56,700
Oh, nice.

3098
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:57,220
I'm shooting my goo.

3099
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,460
That's right, shoot that white goo.

3100
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:00,920
Oh, elevator!

3101
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:04,000
Oh, there's a door!

3102
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:04,440
There's a door!

3103
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:07,060
Oh, my God!

3104
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,140
It's your wife!

3105
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,020
It's your wife, Min!

3106
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:10,220
Where?

3107
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:11,460
She's over here!

3108
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,440
You made her!

3109
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,480
You made her!

3110
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,740
See, I... Are you heading to the laboratory?

3111
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:17,460
I need to get back.

3112
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:18,580
I'm gonna...

3113
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:20,460
Oh, she's gonna shoot the white... Oh!

3114
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:20,860
I'm coming!

3115
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:21,320
Oh!

3116
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:23,240
Oh, that's my boy!

3117
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:24,140
I couldn't help it!

3118
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,960
I'm coming with... She's coming with us!

3119
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:29,620
She's coming with us!

3120
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,260
She's coming with us!

3121
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,080
She's coming with us!

3122
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:32,640
She's on the top!

3123
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,700
You mean that you...

3124
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:38,220
You gotta impress her with your moves.

3125
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:39,180
I know.

3126
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:40,140
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

3127
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:40,840
Let me show her.

3128
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:41,280
Don't worry.

3129
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,800
Oh, you see that?

3130
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:44,760
Oh, let's all dance around here.

3131
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,180
Oh, my gosh.

3132
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:47,280
Jump down the elevator shaft?

3133
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:49,300
Yeah, yeah.

3134
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:50,280
Yeah, that's...

3135
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,060
Hey, hey, lady.

3136
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,020
Whoa!

3137
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,340
Which one is that?

3138
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:02,800
Wait!

3139
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:03,850
The one...

3140
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,680
Do you think she likes it?

3141
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:07,800
Do you think...

3142
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,540
I'm doing the robot here.

3143
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:14,900
That's not the robot.

3144
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,860
That is the Macarena.

3145
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,580
Okay, someone has to press the elevator.

3146
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:26,980
Alright, nice.

3147
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,240
Oh, my God, her hair when we go down.

3148
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:30,760
Oh, wow.

3149
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,680
Damn, this elevator is fast, guys.

3150
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,300
It's the fastest elevator ever.

3151
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:36,360
Yeah.

3152
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:40,500
Someone was like, this looks like a frat house.

3153
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:41,820
Uh-oh.

3154
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,440
Um...

3155
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,120
There's some...

3156
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,320
Wait, did we talk to her?

3157
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,380
Oh, she doesn't want to talk to us.

3158
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,300
She doesn't want to talk to you.

3159
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,020
Oh, okay.

3160
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,020
You talk to her.

3161
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:52,740
Wait, no.

3162
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,700
That's just a dead guy.

3163
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,580
No, but there's another guy.

3164
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:56,540
It looks like a clown.

3165
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:57,840
There's a clown?

3166
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,420
Are you afraid of clowns, man?

3167
01:51:00,860 --> 01:51:01,540
Look at him.

3168
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,800
He's got really long arms.

3169
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:03,320
Where?

3170
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,240
Oh, wait.

3171
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:04,820
There is a clown.

3172
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:05,880
Oh!

3173
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,040
It's...

3174
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:07,700
It's...

3175
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:08,980
They trapped him!

3176
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:10,160
They trapped him!

3177
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:13,480
Whoa!

3178
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,380
I didn't know this was that kind of dungeon.

3179
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:15,860
Yeah!

3180
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:16,260
Yeah!

3181
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:17,960
Wait, wait.

3182
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:19,040
Uh...

3183
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,960
Oh, it's his brother!

3184
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:25,880
That's right.

3185
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:27,100
Dance number five on him!

3186
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:27,560
Dance number five on him!

3187
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,580
What's dance number five?

3188
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
That's someone's brother!

3189
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:35,100
Let it rip!

3190
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:40,280
That's right.

3191
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,660
Someone's brother, yeah.

3192
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:42,300
Yeah.

3193
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,280
Wait, weren't we here before?

3194
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:44,820
Oh, no!

3195
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,440
Oh, no!

3196
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,180
I think there's no...

3197
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,320
Oh, wait, we were!

3198
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:52,580
It's a silent killer.

3199
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,080
Whoa!

3200
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:56,180
Big room.

3201
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,400
Whoa!

3202
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,260
Why are we feeling about to go this way?

3203
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:01,710
This is a...

3204
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:02,820
Oh, we're here.

3205
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:05,200
This is the same one we were in before.

3206
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:07,220
Yeah, but then the guy died.

3207
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:10,060
We have to go downstairs.

3208
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:11,240
We have to find...

3209
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:11,940
Maybe...

3210
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:12,820
A staircase?

3211
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:15,580
A scanner.

3212
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:16,500
Oh.

3213
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:18,420
Oh, nice!

3214
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,360
There's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy, there's a guy.

3215
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:21,080
Oh, I think that's him.

3216
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:24,740
Where do we go?

3217
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,920
I think we're supposed to...

3218
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,540
I don't know.

3219
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,400
Down the laboratory.

3220
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,920
We should keep going down somehow.

3221
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:31,460
Yeah.

3222
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,020
She didn't give us more instructions.

3223
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:34,960
Hi.

3224
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:35,880
Oh.

3225
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:38,920
Oh.

3226
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,160
What is she telling you, Doobie?

3227
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,860
This is a...

3228
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,660
mandatory scam.

3229
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:49,520
You guys don't need to watch this.

3230
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:52,060
It's like...

3231
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:52,880
You're the...

3232
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,000
You know like the...

3233
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,300
We're the booby inspectors.

3234
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,900
I'm just trying to see what the scan thing does.

3235
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:01,480
Oh.

3236
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:02,540
Oh.

3237
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:03,080
Oh.

3238
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:03,540
Oh.

3239
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:06,320
Okay.

3240
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:08,220
Who forgot to push the other button?

3241
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:09,280
Who...

3242
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,960
Who forgot to push the third button?

3243
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:14,800
I didn't realize there was a basement to ruin.

3244
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,720
We're not in the right area.

3245
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:21,860
Whoops.

3246
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:22,200
Sorry.

3247
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,340
That was...

3248
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:25,300
I'm a quick shot.

3249
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,000
No time.

3250
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:26,960
Whoa.

3251
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:28,260
Greg,

3252
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,960
the moon is locked in here.

3253
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:39,700
Oh my god.

3254
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,500
We're in Gru's laboratory, guys.

3255
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,040
We're in Gru's laboratory.

3256
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:48,620
What's the cat...

3257
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:49,800
What's the cat doing with the moon?

3258
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:50,100
Oh yeah.

3259
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:51,460
The cat's staring at the moon.

3260
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:52,360
Wait.

3261
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:52,640
The...

3262
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,580
The lady's gone.

3263
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:54,260
Is that our girl?

3264
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,040
Is that our girl?

3265
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:55,780
Oh, there she is.

3266
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:56,060
Yeah.

3267
01:53:58,180 --> 01:53:59,760
We can pee on the moon.

3268
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,140
I caught the moon for you.

3269
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:01,500
I don't know.

3270
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,240
So this is the moon you are after?

3271
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:06,060
Yeah.

3272
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:06,980
You...

3273
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:08,500
Kinda tiny, isn't it?

3274
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:14,220
Um, some people say it's above average.

3275
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:14,660
Okay?

3276
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,080
Wait.

3277
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,800
Do you guys see the little coronaviruses that are...

3278
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:21,880
What?

3279
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:22,500
Yeah.

3280
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:23,460
Yes.

3281
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,540
Did you see it, Mimi?

3282
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,540
Did you see it?

3283
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:29,300
Wait, wait.

3284
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,040
Did you see it?

3285
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:30,200
Okay.

3286
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:30,240
Okay.

3287
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:30,700
Don't worry.

3288
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:31,680
They'll pass us by.

3289
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:32,680
They'll pass...

3290
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:33,480
I saw it.

3291
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:34,500
Huh?

3292
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:35,200
Yeah, there.

3293
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:35,820
You see it?

3294
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,840
The coronaviruses in here.

3295
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,220
Oh no.

3296
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,040
Guys, I don't wanna get COVID again.

3297
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,780
I can't do it again.

3298
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:48,500
I can't do it again.

3299
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:49,080
I can't do it again.

3300
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:49,540
Guys.

3301
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,900
I got my shots.

3302
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:53,000
What is this?

3303
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,360
I toggled it.

3304
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:55,340
Yes.

3305
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:56,500
Oh.

3306
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:57,340
Ew.

3307
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,140
Something happened.

3308
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,080
Oh?

3309
01:54:59,360 --> 01:54:59,840
I mean, we...

3310
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,420
I don't think it's dangerous right now.

3311
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,720
It does say explore.

3312
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:10,460
Okay.

3313
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,880
I mean, let's just explore and see.

3314
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:13,640
Yeah.

3315
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:15,220
These

3316
01:55:19,950 --> 01:55:20,590
are coming on.

3317
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:21,250
Oh, yeah.

3318
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,170
I see it.

3319
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,350
It's not an elevator here.

3320
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:26,250
Oh.

3321
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:30,490
You know how to use that thing?

3322
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:31,670
No, I...

3323
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:33,190
Call the elevator.

3324
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,830
No, it just shoots on its own.

3325
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:36,690
Look at it.

3326
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:37,250
Oh, wait.

3327
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:37,530
Stop.

3328
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:39,630
Oh, I'm controlling it.

3329
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,430
Wait, you're controlling?

3330
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:42,410
Oh.

3331
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:44,970
Yeah, for some reason when I press the button, I let them do it.

3332
01:55:44,990 --> 01:55:45,290
Oh, cool.

3333
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:48,670
Oh, no.

3334
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:50,050
It's the same elevator.

3335
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:50,810
Oh.

3336
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:52,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3337
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:53,630
Can we go in?

3338
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:54,510
Is it?

3339
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:55,890
It says first, second, and third.

3340
01:55:57,430 --> 01:55:57,790
Unless...

3341
01:55:57,790 --> 01:55:58,350
I mean, we could try.

3342
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:01,070
Is there any other buttons left?

3343
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,210
Is there anything else around?

3344
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:04,810
Oh, this is a different elevator.

3345
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:05,310
Oh.

3346
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:05,890
Okay.

3347
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:08,870
Chad's like...

3348
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:10,530
Wireless gun.

3349
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:13,610
My gun has blue teeth.

3350
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:14,670
This is an electronic board.

3351
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:15,970
Oh, so we have to go to...

3352
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:16,470
Oh, yeah.

3353
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:17,390
We'll go to the elevator.

3354
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:18,450
Elevator, yeah.

3355
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:19,530
Yeah.

3356
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:25,070
It's just shooting.

3357
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:26,170
On its own.

3358
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,110
I need it.

3359
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,210
It's Bluetooth wireless.

3360
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:29,730
Oh.

3361
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:30,410
What floor do we do?

3362
01:56:30,610 --> 01:56:31,150
Wait, do we need it?

3363
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,110
Yeah, we might need it.

3364
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:34,770
Get it out of here at all.

3365
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:38,640
I don't like it.

3366
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,180
No, me...

3367
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:41,880
Doobie's controlling it.

3368
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,040
I know, but it's in my head.

3369
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,600
Okay, so dude, what floor do we do?

3370
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,000
I'll do a second floor.

3371
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,260
We need electric boards is what it says.

3372
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:53,280
We need two of them.

3373
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,180
Is this an electric board?

3374
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:55,100
I think so.

3375
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:55,740
Is that it?

3376
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:57,240
It's a scanner.

3377
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,100
It's a board.

3378
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,120
Oh, it's a scanner.

3379
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:00,620
Yeah, we're on a different floor.

3380
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:01,220
Oh, okay.

3381
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:03,740
Oh, this is where the...

3382
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:05,680
I think this is a save point, guys.

3383
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,640
Oh, nice.

3384
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,640
Let's save it.

3385
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:09,560
Okay, nice.

3386
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,820
There's something appearing on my radar.

3387
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:11,820
Oh.

3388
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:13,560
Oh, no.

3389
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:16,600
Oh, maybe that finds the electric boards.

3390
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:18,320
Wait, maybe it's the moon.

3391
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,260
It's the moon.

3392
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:20,720
It's the moon.

3393
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,740
Oh, I see it.

3394
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:22,600
COVID's coming.

3395
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:24,100
Oh, you're right.

3396
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:26,220
What do you mean?

3397
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:29,220
Award 2019, tell the COVID.

3398
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,540
What happens when...

3399
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,700
Can I shoot it?

3400
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:34,840
Can I shoot it?

3401
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:36,740
They are.

3402
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,060
Oh.

3403
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:38,240
My aim.

3404
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:40,220
Oops.

3405
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,920
Were you able to shoot your white goo on it?

3406
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,360
I'm trying to.

3407
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:45,200
You need me to shoot.

3408
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:50,680
I have performance anxiety.

3409
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:53,620
Wait.

3410
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,780
Maybe the right side?

3411
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:56,680
Or we go forward.

3412
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:57,380
Wait.

3413
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,260
There's something over here.

3414
01:57:58,580 --> 01:57:59,060
What's that?

3415
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,620
I just toggled something.

3416
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,460
I don't know what happened.

3417
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:02,480
Oh, I found it.

3418
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,220
Oh, I found a lever.

3419
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:04,160
Oh, wait.

3420
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:09,000
The gate to the lower floor is locked by multiple levers.

3421
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,400
They must be activated simultaneously?

3422
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:12,320
What?

3423
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:15,880
Okay.

3424
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,480
I have a lever for one of them.

3425
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:18,520
Wait.

3426
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,320
How many are there?

3427
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:21,360
There's four of us.

3428
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,440
It's in...

3429
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,680
I thought it was on another one, but it was just a reflection.

3430
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:31,440
Oh.

3431
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:32,980
Maybe it's on the other side.

3432
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,720
Maybe the lever's on the other side.

3433
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,260
Is there a lever over here?

3434
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:42,680
Here comes COVID.

3435
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:44,640
Oh no.

3436
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,840
Wait, what are those?

3437
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:46,360
They're little...

3438
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:47,520
Oh, they're little guys!

3439
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,240
What is that?

3440
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,260
Okay, we found another one.

3441
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:00,660
Oh.

3442
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:06,210
Did you press yours?

3443
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:07,270
No.

3444
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:07,630
Wait.

3445
01:59:07,730 --> 01:59:09,390
I thought we had to push them at the same time.

3446
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:09,890
Okay.

3447
01:59:10,190 --> 01:59:10,970
I'll do a countdown.

3448
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:13,390
Do you guys hear me from here?

3449
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:14,490
Do it really well.

3450
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:15,150
Oh!

3451
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:16,130
Oh!

3452
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:17,370
Oh!

3453
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:21,720
He's following me.

3454
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,360
Do fake...

3455
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,680
Do fake and angry?

3456
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:24,440
Yeah.

3457
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:26,160
Wait.

3458
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,360
Is there a lever over there?

3459
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:28,340
I have a lever...

3460
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:29,000
Yeah, there is, there is.

3461
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:30,120
Nimi's at a lever.

3462
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:31,360
Okay.

3463
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:32,300
Okay.

3464
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:33,600
Then...

3465
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:35,820
You have that one, and then I have probably the one of...

3466
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:38,240
Oh!

3467
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:39,060
It's a second...

3468
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,080
It's a five second cooldown!

3469
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:40,760
Nimi!

3470
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:41,920
Turn on your lever!

3471
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:52,380
Don't press it yet.

3472
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:53,640
Don't press it?

3473
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:55,140
She said she'll shoot the gun when Nimi presses it.

3474
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:55,460
Okay.

3475
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,360
Do you think...

3476
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:00,880
Not yet.

3477
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:01,980
Not yet.

3478
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:06,320
Um...

3479
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,560
Um...

3480
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:09,700
Do you think the bluetooth range fell off?

3481
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:11,560
Oh!

3482
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:12,060
Oh!

3483
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,820
Press it!

3484
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:15,920
Did it work?

3485
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:16,500
No.

3486
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:19,140
Is it more...

3487
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:21,020
There must be another lever, cause I have this.

3488
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:21,760
Oh!

3489
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,140
Remember, there's the one upstairs!

3490
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:24,260
I think that...

3491
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:24,600
Yeah, but...

3492
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,900
Does that have to...

3493
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:26,400
Also?

3494
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,620
Yeah, I think so.

3495
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,160
Oh!

3496
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:32,080
Okay.

3497
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:34,180
It didn't work!

3498
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:36,720
Oh!

3499
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,180
Nimi died.

3500
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:39,960
Nimi died?

3501
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,520
Yeah, Nimi's dead.

3502
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:42,220
Apparently.

3503
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:42,840
I think...

3504
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,100
I think it got her.

3505
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:46,800
Well, let's just go back upstairs and we got her.

3506
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,240
No, wait.

3507
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,460
There's a save area here, remember?

3508
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:48,840
Oh!

3509
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:49,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3510
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:52,960
Is Doobie dead?

3511
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:54,180
Yeah.

3512
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:57,940
We did turn on the lever, it didn't work.

3513
02:00:58,440 --> 02:00:59,320
But I think there...

3514
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:00,600
Is there another lever down here?

3515
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:01,780
Because I do have...

3516
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:02,480
Uh...

3517
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:03,340
I do have this handle.

3518
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:04,500
Well, wait.

3519
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:06,400
Let's go check the third floor, too, then.

3520
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:09,320
Yeah, but how are we gonna coordinate, like, all four, though?

3521
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,120
That's the thing.

3522
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:13,700
Yeah, cause don't you need everyone to be in the elevator to use it?

3523
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:14,400
Yeah.

3524
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,920
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3525
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:19,260
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3526
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:24,480
He only has to kill one of us.

3527
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,400
Oh, he's a little coward baby.

3528
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:28,840
Yeah.

3529
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:30,740
We got our shots.

3530
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,420
Yeah, we got our shots.

3531
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:39,980
Yeah.

3532
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,280
It's scary.

3533
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,780
Oh, it's like we're animals.

3534
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:46,440
Yeah.

3535
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:47,300
We got our...

3536
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,800
We got our flea shots.

3537
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:49,200
Yeah.

3538
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:51,180
Oh, no!

3539
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:51,980
Oh, no.

3540
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:52,860
It went after me!

3541
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:55,680
Uh-oh.

3542
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:57,400
Did she make it?

3543
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,020
I don't know.

3544
02:01:58,540 --> 02:01:58,980
It makes that...

3545
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:00,520
It's making that sound, like...

3546
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:02,460
I think she's...

3547
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,380
Oh, she ran to the elevator.

3548
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:03,620
Yeah.

3549
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:04,980
You made it!

3550
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:06,960
Let's just check the third floor, then, for now.

3551
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:08,440
Okay.

3552
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,480
Yeah, let's go...

3553
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,740
Let's go down one more.

3554
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:13,280
Cause I do...

3555
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,580
I'm just gonna hold on to this lever, then, just in case.

3556
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:16,840
Nah.

3557
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,460
I'm gonna go through here just to see there's anything.

3558
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:19,920
Alright.

3559
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:20,880
Yeah, first floor.

3560
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,440
We'll be back.

3561
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:24,540
We'll be back.

3562
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:25,120
I'm here!

3563
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:25,500
Wait!

3564
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:27,580
Hey!

3565
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,320
Wait!

3566
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,320
Wait!

3567
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,020
Yeah, did she just...

3568
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,360
Did she just left us?

3569
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:40,360
Wait, she actually went down the floor.

3570
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:41,200
She...

3571
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:42,780
I think she went up.

3572
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:43,640
Or did she...

3573
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:44,080
Wait...

3574
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,240
No, she's coming up.

3575
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,100
Yeah, she's coming up.

3576
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:47,060
Wait...

3577
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:47,900
Oh, fuck.

3578
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,700
Yeah, she just left us.

3579
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,360
It works without everybody being in the elevator.

3580
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:54,180
Oh, that's good.

3581
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:54,660
Okay.

3582
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:56,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3583
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,480
Yeah, but how do we do the countdown?

3584
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,460
Time to split up, gang.

3585
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:04,180
And then do it when the clock strikes.

3586
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,880
Wait, let's get our alarm.

3587
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:06,640
Let's set up a alarm.

3588
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:07,500
Sink our alarms.

3589
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:08,160
Oh, yeah.

3590
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:11,340
What is that?

3591
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:11,860
What is this?

3592
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:13,240
Yeah, this is what I saw before.

3593
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:15,120
There's a mini.

3594
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,020
It's a little die.

3595
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:17,980
Oh, there you go.

3596
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:18,920
Oh, there's a broken lever.

3597
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:19,360
Here you go.

3598
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:21,600
Documentation for the crystal.

3599
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,720
The crystal made from an orange.

3600
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:29,020
It glows with a bright orange pattern and emits orange particles that gradually fade away.

3601
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:32,000
When the moon remains indoors for an extended period.

3602
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:32,680
What is that?

3603
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:33,960
We got it!

3604
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:36,500
He accumulates at the bottom of the foam.

3605
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:36,800
Meatball.

3606
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:38,860
Aiding the ripening of oranges.

3607
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,460
It's like a...

3608
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,680
Wait, is this an orange?

3609
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,360
Orange!

3610
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,580
Yeah, for the TV!

3611
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:44,560
Oh my god.

3612
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:49,940
If you need to approach the area beneath the moon, please take the crystal with you and stay close to it.

3613
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,240
Okay, so you gotta take him.

3614
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:52,780
Gotta take him?

3615
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,320
Take him!

3616
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,400
It's my hand.

3617
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:55,840
What do you?

3618
02:03:58,320 --> 02:03:59,120
Look at him.

3619
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,220
He's just a little orange.

3620
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,680
Has the gun always been in this position?

3621
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:08,660
I don't know.

3622
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:13,100
He's just very excited.

3623
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:16,360
Alright, so we have all the lever...

3624
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:16,700
How do we...

3625
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:18,220
Aren't we gonna do the countdown for this?

3626
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:18,760
Wait!

3627
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,340
Oh, I know!

3628
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:20,300
It shows a light!

3629
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:22,120
It shows a light when someone presses it.

3630
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:23,420
Oh, yeah!

3631
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,600
So we can just...

3632
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:25,280
Yeah, sing it up!

3633
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:25,800
Yeah, yeah.

3634
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,080
Okay, I call bottom floor.

3635
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:28,860
Wait, we have the floor?

3636
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,100
Alright, I'll do the first one.

3637
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:32,980
I'll do the first one.

3638
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:34,780
Bye!

3639
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:36,240
Alright, give me...

3640
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:38,580
Guys, I need to like, get tissues real quick anyway.

3641
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,140
I'll be right back.

3642
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,700
I also didn't want to go through...

3643
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:42,920
I didn't want to go through the viruses again.

3644
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,140
I need to blow my nose.

3645
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,820
We can...

3646
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:06,300
They...

3647
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,000
Whoever has to do two and three...

3648
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,980
Has to go through the most dangerous ones.

3649
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:11,940
So...

3650
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,540
I wonder if they...

3651
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:14,740
They have to be close there.

3652
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,740
I hear them a little bit.

3653
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:18,120
Oh.

3654
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:22,370
One more.

3655
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:24,030
Oh, someone's not there.

3656
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:24,710
No!

3657
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,110
Okay.

3658
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:28,590
Okay, I...

3659
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,170
We fucked it up.

3660
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,450
Okay.

3661
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:30,430
We gotta wait.

3662
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:30,910
We gotta wait.

3663
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:31,650
We gotta wait.

3664
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:31,850
No!

3665
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:32,350
Stop!

3666
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:33,510
Everyone stop!

3667
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:37,130
We're hunting now!

3668
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:37,870
Okay.

3669
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:38,670
Alright.

3670
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:39,590
That's fine.

3671
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:40,250
That's fine.

3672
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:40,870
I go first.

3673
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:42,110
Okay.

3674
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:46,480
Yes!

3675
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:47,040
We did it!

3676
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:48,880
Oh, and I...

3677
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:49,940
Oh, we get to be at the bottom.

3678
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:50,400
Yay!

3679
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:51,760
They have to come back at the bottom.

3680
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:53,220
Whoa, what?

3681
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,240
What?

3682
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:56,380
Oh, it's lethal.

3683
02:05:56,380 --> 02:05:58,160
We have to have the virus thing.

3684
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:02,080
Come to the bottom, guys.

3685
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,180
If you hear my voice, you have to be at the bottom.

3686
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:06,180
We need the orange.

3687
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:10,300
We need the orange.

3688
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:13,160
Yeah, yeah, there's a...

3689
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,500
We need the orange, guys.

3690
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:18,420
It's on the first floor.

3691
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:19,640
It's at the very bottom.

3692
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:24,700
We need our vitamin C.

3693
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:30,100
We're so close to saving the moon.

3694
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:32,580
Oh!

3695
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:33,680
What's chat?

3696
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:35,580
What's chat?

3697
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:37,340
Wait, where's...

3698
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:38,320
Where's Mitt?

3699
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:39,060
Don't look at him.

3700
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:39,600
Don't look at him.

3701
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:40,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3702
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:42,860
Oh, it's like a little ring.

3703
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:43,740
So, like...

3704
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:45,280
As long as we're in the ring, we're safe.

3705
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:47,120
Yeah, yeah.

3706
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:48,360
I don't know.

3707
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:50,080
The moon.

3708
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:50,360
The moon.

3709
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:53,820
I don't know how to trigger him.

3710
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,000
If we look at him, do we trigger him?

3711
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:56,980
I think so.

3712
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:59,020
He probably has a meter if you look at him for too long.

3713
02:06:59,140 --> 02:06:59,860
Oh, that's true.

3714
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:02,000
He doesn't like to be looked at.

3715
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:06,160
Although, I feel like there was one time nobody was looking at him and he attacked us.

3716
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:07,760
No, I'm pretty sure one of us looked.

3717
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,460
One of us did it.

3718
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:10,860
Yeah.

3719
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:12,060
Alright, let's go.

3720
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:13,480
Stay at the orange.

3721
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:14,220
Stay in the orange.

3722
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,260
Or we die.

3723
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:16,960
Going this way.

3724
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:17,460
Alright.

3725
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:18,400
There's a cat.

3726
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:18,880
There's a cat.

3727
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:19,780
Oh, look.

3728
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:20,280
There's a cat.

3729
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,140
He's so cute.

3730
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:22,820
Yeah.

3731
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,180
What's this?

3732
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,160
What is that?

3733
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,400
Electronic board.

3734
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:30,360
Oh, one of the boards we need.

3735
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:31,140
Oh, nice.

3736
02:07:32,420 --> 02:07:32,880
Two more.

3737
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:33,240
I'll try.

3738
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:34,960
Run, run, run!

3739
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:36,580
We gotta follow them, the orange!

3740
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:37,800
Woo!

3741
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:40,860
Oh my god, he got somebody.

3742
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:41,700
He got someone.

3743
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:42,860
Oh, it's down, it's down.

3744
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:43,500
Is he satisfied?

3745
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:44,840
Yeah, I think he's satisfied.

3746
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:46,280
Wait, someone...

3747
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:46,900
Is there a save down here?

3748
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:48,200
Someone died to the moon.

3749
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:50,760
I heard the boom sound.

3750
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:51,600
Someone...

3751
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,660
I think Min died to the moon.

3752
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,340
I hope there's...

3753
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:57,340
We gotta find a save.

3754
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:58,620
I'm pretty sure it has to be.

3755
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,120
Oh, there's an A.

3756
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:03,300
There's an Easter.

3757
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:03,700
Oh, no.

3758
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:04,440
There's another one.

3759
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:06,220
Wait.

3760
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:08,240
Oh, there's more.

3761
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:09,880
Did Min look at him?

3762
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,580
Min must have looked at him.

3763
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:15,400
Oh!

3764
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:16,380
Wait.

3765
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:17,200
What's this?

3766
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,600
What are we pushing this to?

3767
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:24,680
There's three of them now!

3768
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:25,200
There's three!

3769
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:26,480
One for each of us!

3770
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:26,880
Oh!

3771
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:27,660
Oh!

3772
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:28,420
No, not the moon!

3773
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:29,040
The moon fires!

3774
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:31,240
Oh, no.

3775
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:33,220
They're gonna take our bodies.

3776
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:37,640
We gotta find a save before they kill us.

3777
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:38,820
Yeah.

3778
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:41,020
I wonder if it's up the stairs.

3779
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:42,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3780
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:42,920
Let's go up the stairs.

3781
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:43,240
Yeah.

3782
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:46,660
Okay.

3783
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,080
We go.

3784
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:52,260
I don't think they can go upstairs.

3785
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,540
No, I don't think so, too.

3786
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:54,600
They don't have the legs.

3787
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:56,160
Oh, there's a save.

3788
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,020
Oh, nice!

3789
02:08:58,460 --> 02:08:59,080
Let's go.

3790
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:00,420
Welcome back!

3791
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:01,040
I'm home!

3792
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:02,360
Oh, they can go upstairs.

3793
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:03,580
So, what happened?

3794
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:05,140
Did the moon virus got you?

3795
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:07,580
Yeah, I got got by the moon virus.

3796
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:08,460
What happened?

3797
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:09,000
Oh!

3798
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:11,060
Yes, I do!

3799
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:11,900
I do!

3800
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:15,280
What is that?

3801
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:16,500
I have the crystal.

3802
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:16,880
I'm safe.

3803
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:17,620
Oh, my God!

3804
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:18,120
Wait.

3805
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:19,520
I don't think we're safe with the crystal.

3806
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:20,600
I don't...

3807
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:20,900
I...

3808
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:21,220
Oh.

3809
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:25,120
Oh!

3810
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:25,740
Oh, the moon virus...

3811
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:27,220
The moon virus is infectious here!

3812
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:33,430
What's this?

3813
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:36,010
Wait.

3814
02:09:36,150 --> 02:09:37,130
Fully red, orange is right.

3815
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:37,910
It's planted on it.

3816
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:39,730
The new heal should take hold within...

3817
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:41,430
What the fuck is that?

3818
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:45,900
Hello.

3819
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,080
Hello, chat.

3820
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,460
Hello?

3821
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:52,460
Is he still chasing you?

3822
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:00,110
Welcome back, everyone.

3823
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:01,410
Oh, hello.

3824
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:03,130
No, no, no, no!

3825
02:10:03,590 --> 02:10:05,170
I don't want to be trying to...

3826
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:12,830
I don't know what to do!

3827
02:10:14,690 --> 02:10:16,130
Open the safe box?

3828
02:10:16,690 --> 02:10:17,950
What's the safe box?

3829
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:20,370
Capsule, capsule!

3830
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:21,890
We gotta place the capsule!

3831
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:22,670
We gotta place the capsule!

3832
02:10:22,670 --> 02:10:23,010
What's the capsule?

3833
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:24,130
What do we place it?

3834
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:25,010
This, this, this!

3835
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:26,090
What?

3836
02:10:26,270 --> 02:10:26,970
How do we...

3837
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:28,190
We could push it?

3838
02:10:28,830 --> 02:10:29,870
What do we push it?

3839
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:30,090
Oh, no!

3840
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:31,930
See where the red light is?

3841
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:32,830
We gotta push it down there.

3842
02:10:33,070 --> 02:10:33,250
Oh.

3843
02:10:35,990 --> 02:10:37,290
Push it with all our strength.

3844
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,490
Right there, right there.

3845
02:10:38,650 --> 02:10:39,230
Oh, okay.

3846
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,910
Nice.

3847
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:43,150
Okay, we gotta push the other one.

3848
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:44,030
We gotta push the other one.

3849
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:44,810
Okay, we have five more.

3850
02:10:45,810 --> 02:10:47,470
It was over on the other side.

3851
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:49,550
Alright, where's the Shadow Man?

3852
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:50,070
Okay, wait, wait.

3853
02:10:50,110 --> 02:10:51,290
Let's all get Doobie back, guys.

3854
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:51,590
Guys.

3855
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:51,870
Guys.

3856
02:10:52,570 --> 02:10:52,930
Doobie.

3857
02:10:53,110 --> 02:10:53,250
Yeah.

3858
02:10:53,450 --> 02:10:54,010
Get Doobie back.

3859
02:10:55,370 --> 02:10:55,730
Hello.

3860
02:10:56,070 --> 02:10:56,830
Welcome back, Doobie.

3861
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:58,950
There's also a capsule downstairs.

3862
02:10:59,730 --> 02:11:01,670
I think that's where, like, we have to go back down.

3863
02:11:02,350 --> 02:11:05,430
I don't think we push... we have to push that when we're downstairs.

3864
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:07,710
Yeah, we can push this one.

3865
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:08,130
Yeah, yeah.

3866
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:09,510
Push, push, push, push.

3867
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:10,310
Oh god, there's so much.

3868
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:12,690
Chat's all here cheering for us right now.

3869
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:13,150
Oh god, he's right there.

3870
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:13,770
He's right there.

3871
02:11:19,690 --> 02:11:20,570
I'm pushing it?

3872
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:23,970
Don't worry!

3873
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:25,470
Be bait!

3874
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:27,110
I'm pushing it!

3875
02:11:36,130 --> 02:11:36,690
AHHHHH!

3876
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:38,350
Is anyone dead?

3877
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:40,370
Is anyone dead?

3878
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:41,210
Oh, I just watched Rizmi die.

3879
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:42,570
Yeah, how is Rizmi?

3880
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:43,850
Hello.

3881
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:45,650
We're almost fully... AHHHHH!

3882
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:46,010
I'm back!

3883
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:54,150
Rizmi!

3884
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:06,720
I died, dude.

3885
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:11,060
I can't believe it.

3886
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,220
We're all dead.

3887
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,960
Oh, yay!

3888
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:16,940
Hello!

3889
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:17,560
Hello!

3890
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:17,980
Hello!

3891
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,060
Alright, I'll push again.

3892
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:22,000
I guess, Doobie, yours, yeah, you're dead.

3893
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:22,500
Okay.

3894
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,040
And then the last one was...

3895
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,740
Wait, how- we have to get the last one up top?

3896
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:30,700
I believe in you, Doobie!

3897
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:34,120
Doobie has to push it up all the way here.

3898
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:35,640
Yeah, I know.

3899
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:36,880
That's a lot.

3900
02:12:38,700 --> 02:12:42,080
Hopefully she- wait, if she dies, the orb stays down there.

3901
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:43,620
No, no, there's a trade here.

3902
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,840
Oh, okay, just get it.

3903
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,600
There's a guy behind us.

3904
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,240
He's behind us.

3905
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:48,020
Run!

3906
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:48,540
Run!

3907
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:49,700
He's behind us.

3908
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:50,640
Latex man!

3909
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:52,480
Why did you die?

3910
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,720
It's the invisible man from the movie.

3911
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,520
Do you hear, like, how squeaky he is?

3912
02:12:57,540 --> 02:12:58,280
Yeah, he is.

3913
02:12:59,220 --> 02:13:00,480
It's invisible man.

3914
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:02,460
Oh my god, look at Doobie.

3915
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:03,420
Do you see Doobie?

3916
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:06,700
Look at her go into your way up.

3917
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,880
He's doing it.

3918
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:08,600
She's doing it.

3919
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:09,160
She's doing it.

3920
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:09,580
She's doing it!

3921
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:10,460
I'm behind me!

3922
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:15,200
Oh yeah, that's true.

3923
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,000
We have to distract him.

3924
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:16,720
Oh yeah.

3925
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,720
Oh my god, I think we're distracting him.

3926
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,800
Okay, let's hope Doobie is- is pushing.

3927
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:27,040
Oh, where is he?

3928
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:27,820
Oh, I see him.

3929
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:29,200
I'm gonna go this way.

3930
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:31,660
Okay.

3931
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:36,160
He has to go this way, because Doobie has to push the other way.

3932
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:41,600
Can we do it?

3933
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:45,700
Oh, Doobie, what's going on?

3934
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:49,700
Oh, uh, can you get- go stand on the stairs and then push this thing?

3935
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:51,360
Okay, there.

3936
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:52,360
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3937
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:52,960
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3938
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,780
Alright, where is the latex man?

3939
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:57,040
I think he's distracting him.

3940
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:57,540
Okay.

3941
02:13:58,480 --> 02:13:59,340
Alright, we're pushing.

3942
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:01,660
Slow and steady.

3943
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:02,860
Slow and steady.

3944
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:04,220
I miss.

3945
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:06,760
Push, push.

3946
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:07,400
Push.

3947
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:08,040
Nice.

3948
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:09,100
Yay!

3949
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:10,880
Now what?

3950
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:12,340
Got the dynamite!

3951
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:13,460
Oh, the dynamite!

3952
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:15,940
It was like- Where was that?

3953
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,320
Oh my god, where was that?

3954
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:20,540
It was the third- it was like- Outside.

3955
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:22,040
You have to go back through the basement.

3956
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:26,600
Insert the electrical board, open the hatches to the laboratory- Save, save, save, save, save!

3957
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:29,080
Leave the laboratory and blow up the- Oh my god!

3958
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:33,860
I am- Insert the electrical boards open- Ho- what?

3959
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:35,260
Wait.

3960
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,080
I'll insert the electrical boards open up- Where's that guy goin'?

3961
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:41,600
We, uh, leave the laboratory?

3962
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:42,720
Oh, never mind.

3963
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:44,680
Hahahaha.

3964
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,540
The- the- instructions unclear.

3965
02:14:46,900 --> 02:14:49,600
I don't know- Where's the electrical board?

3966
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:51,160
Who makes it on the first floor?

3967
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:53,500
Um- Oh my god.

3968
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:54,120
Oh my god!

3969
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:54,320
Oh!

3970
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,400
I was trying to figure this...

3971
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,240
We can get more crystals if we lose it.

3972
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:03,180
I'm just looking at the update.

3973
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:03,640
No, we can.

3974
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:04,020
We can.

3975
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:04,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3976
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:07,200
But we can't get more dynamite, apparently.

3977
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:11,580
Oh, in the PC room, you got the electrical board earlier?

3978
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:13,820
Where's PC room?

3979
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:18,040
It looks like bacon.

3980
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:23,420
Guys, at chat, instructions unclear.

3981
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:26,440
Chat, look up the wiki.

3982
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:27,360
Yeah, look up the wiki.

3983
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:29,260
Yeah, let's just leave.

3984
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:30,000
Oh, wait.

3985
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:30,920
Wait, wait, virus!

3986
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:32,220
Do me, do me, do me, do me, do me!

3987
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:33,180
We're gonna get blue virus!

3988
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:34,100
We're gonna get blue virus!

3989
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:36,140
Oh, she got blue!

3990
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,420
I thought she was in it!

3991
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:40,820
She's hanging out.

3992
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:42,380
Oh, wait, I'm gonna die!

3993
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:45,100
Oh, that's the blue virus!

3994
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:47,200
Aw!

3995
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:50,420
Okay, third floor.

3996
02:15:51,380 --> 02:15:52,320
She got moon.

3997
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:53,580
We'll remember her.

3998
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:54,700
Wait, we can revive her at the second floor.

3999
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:55,500
Oh, yeah, that's true.

4000
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:58,060
Isn't there, there's no revive on the third, right?

4001
02:15:58,840 --> 02:15:59,180
Mm-mm.

4002
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:00,800
Alright, let's go to the second.

4003
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:01,380
I don't remember.

4004
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:05,040
Too much radiation from the moon.

4005
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:06,640
Alright.

4006
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,360
That wouldn't help.

4007
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:09,580
I don't know, I've never been to the moon.

4008
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:10,180
I guess, probably, right?

4009
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:12,800
Too much orange, and all the orange.

4010
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,480
Yeah, yeah, and vitamin C.

4011
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:18,620
Alright.

4012
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:19,940
Welcome back.

4013
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:21,360
How was it?

4014
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:22,600
Having the moon virus.

4015
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:26,380
Better than having the COVID virus.

4016
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:27,760
That's so true.

4017
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:28,780
That's so true.

4018
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:32,100
Wait, did we get the...

4019
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:34,300
There was a circuit board from the bottom floor?

4020
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:35,040
What?

4021
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:35,780
Was there?

4022
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:38,020
Did we get the one that was in the lab?

4023
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:40,280
Somebody had one, right?

4024
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:41,400
I don't remember.

4025
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,900
Someone was definitely carrying one around.

4026
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:48,200
Oh, yeah, she left.

4027
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,280
Oh, she left.

4028
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:50,680
Oh, I know.

4029
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:51,240
It was weird.

4030
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:57,680
Oh, okay.

4031
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:58,660
I was holding it.

4032
02:16:58,860 --> 02:16:59,380
Wait, give...

4033
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:00,280
Okay, give us the dynamite.

4034
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:01,160
We'll give you the moon.

4035
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:02,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4036
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:04,960
Wait, Min's gonna get one electrical board.

4037
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:07,260
But she needs...

4038
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:08,420
She needs the vitamin C.

4039
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:09,460
Yeah.

4040
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:10,160
There you go.

4041
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:11,180
Take it.

4042
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:12,180
Wait, oh, wait.

4043
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:12,720
I'll come with...

4044
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:16,500
I'll come with you because, like, you can't hold it with two hands, remember?

4045
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:18,540
Oh, you can't?

4046
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:19,340
I don't know, actually.

4047
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:20,320
I don't think so.

4048
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:21,380
I'm pretty sure you can.

4049
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:21,640
Oh, come on.

4050
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:22,820
Alright, let's go.

4051
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:24,040
We'll have to go anyway.

4052
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:24,720
First floor.

4053
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:25,200
First floor.

4054
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:26,380
So, where did you die?

4055
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,080
I know where I died.

4056
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:30,300
So, where was it?

4057
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:31,660
It wasn't upstairs.

4058
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:32,280
It was downstairs.

4059
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:33,080
Okay, that's good.

4060
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:33,660
That's easier.

4061
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:34,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4062
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,120
Okay, wait.

4063
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,380
I'll hold the...

4064
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:38,980
Because then you can grab the thing.

4065
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:41,600
I'll hold the orange.

4066
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:44,600
Okay, then I'll have to hold the fucking electrical board.

4067
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,700
Choose one or the other.

4068
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:47,020
It's right here.

4069
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:47,820
Oh, okay.

4070
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:49,020
Oh, that's a fucking gun.

4071
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:49,580
Oh, I got it.

4072
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:51,380
Oh, you can hold more than two.

4073
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:51,860
Never mind.

4074
02:17:51,980 --> 02:17:52,540
See, I told...

4075
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,940
You can hold up to three items.

4076
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:55,840
Okay, I didn't know that.

4077
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:57,300
I just thought that...

4078
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:59,680
I thought you can only hold one item.

4079
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:00,440
Cause you...

4080
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,280
Oh, I dropped all of them at the same time.

4081
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:02,540
Okay.

4082
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:04,220
Oh, good job.

4083
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:05,580
Yay.

4084
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:06,980
Yay.

4085
02:18:06,980 --> 02:18:09,040
Oh, I see what she meant by the placement.

4086
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:10,360
Yeah, like...

4087
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:10,960
Oh, God.

4088
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:16,300
Now you know.

4089
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:17,240
Yeah.

4090
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:17,980
Alright, we got it.

4091
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:19,720
You're making some people very happy right now.

4092
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:23,240
We got one of the electrical boards.

4093
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:24,980
We don't know what the other ones are though.

4094
02:18:25,980 --> 02:18:27,340
Where do we insert it though?

4095
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:27,860
Put it on the back.

4096
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:28,240
Right here.

4097
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:28,640
Right here.

4098
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:29,280
Oh.

4099
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:32,000
Okay.

4100
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:32,340
Yeah.

4101
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:34,820
Okay, so we need...

4102
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:35,240
Three more.

4103
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:35,520
Yeah.

4104
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:36,300
Chat!

4105
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:37,640
Where are the other three?

4106
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:41,740
There's three more.

4107
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:42,720
There's two here.

4108
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,660
But I guess somewhere else needs more.

4109
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:46,300
Yeah, there's two.

4110
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,180
We didn't see anything, did we?

4111
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:49,180
I don't know.

4112
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,420
I don't remember.

4113
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:54,540
The other three are outside?

4114
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,760
The other three are outside?

4115
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,180
There's one...

4116
02:18:59,180 --> 02:19:00,000
One person.

4117
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:01,400
One singular person.

4118
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:03,420
The one guy.

4119
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:05,400
Alright, do we get one guy?

4120
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:11,560
Oh, somebody said there was one in the computer lab.

4121
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:13,320
Do we trust that guy?

4122
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:14,060
That one guy?

4123
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:15,980
Oh, we have to bring the orange to him too.

4124
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4125
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:17,800
Might as well.

4126
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,080
Yeah.

4127
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:18,540
Okay.

4128
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:19,560
Cause like...

4129
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:21,600
Where does the dynamite go?

4130
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:24,620
Isn't he gonna turn into like an evil creature though?

4131
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:25,500
No, no.

4132
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:26,480
He seems friendly.

4133
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:27,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4134
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:28,240
He's gonna be friendly.

4135
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,300
He's gonna join a party.

4136
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:30,780
Yeah, we'll have five people.

4137
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:31,740
What was it?

4138
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:32,220
First floor?

4139
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:32,580
Yeah.

4140
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:33,580
Okay.

4141
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:35,380
Yeah, I don't wanna go back to the basement.

4142
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:35,760
Yeah, this is orange.

4143
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:39,100
It was first floor and then we gotta go to the third floor.

4144
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:39,400
Yeah.

4145
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:39,660
Yeah.

4146
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:41,460
How do we get to the third floor?

4147
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:42,460
We should save.

4148
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:43,620
Oh.

4149
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:44,220
Yeah we should.

4150
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:47,700
Okay.

4151
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:48,660
Okay, I'm just...

4152
02:19:48,660 --> 02:19:50,000
Okay, we have to go back to the running man.

4153
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:53,640
Where's the save here anyway?

4154
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:56,440
I don't remember any of this.

4155
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:57,600
This looks good to me.

4156
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:59,340
Oh, wait, put the diamond!

4157
02:19:59,500 --> 02:19:59,660
Yeah!

4158
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,940
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4159
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:05,580
Nice.

4160
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:06,880
Nice.

4161
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:08,020
Okay, we did that.

4162
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:10,980
Maybe it's a shortcut, yeah.

4163
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:14,060
I bet the electrical boards are out here.

4164
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:16,000
Oh, that's what the one guy said.

4165
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:17,120
Yeah.

4166
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:18,760
Wait, what's this?

4167
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:21,720
Guys, guys, guys.

4168
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:29,050
Oh, that means the third floor is free.

4169
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:32,730
We have to be more careful here, Susan.

4170
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:34,250
Wait.

4171
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:39,850
Um...

4172
02:20:39,850 --> 02:20:41,950
So, I opened both doors now.

4173
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:43,450
But, like...

4174
02:20:43,450 --> 02:20:45,110
Maybe the electric boards are out here.

4175
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:47,950
Okay, wait, that means the third floor should be, like...

4176
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:49,470
Not dangerous anymore, right?

4177
02:20:49,770 --> 02:20:51,890
Yeah, but I don't think we should explore until we save.

4178
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:52,970
Yeah, we should save, yeah.

4179
02:20:53,410 --> 02:20:54,450
Where is the save point?

4180
02:20:55,370 --> 02:20:56,170
I don't know.

4181
02:20:57,670 --> 02:20:59,190
I don't know either.

4182
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:04,270
I saw Slenderman in the other building, so...

4183
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:05,630
Okay, so we should be fine.

4184
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:07,010
And we chained his brother, too.

4185
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:08,310
Famous laughter.

4186
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:13,420
He does like stairs.

4187
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:15,020
Wait, he's gone!

4188
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:17,620
Wait, Doobie said she found it?

4189
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:18,120
Oh!

4190
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,240
Doobie, where are you?

4191
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:24,540
Marco!

4192
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:24,640
Go!

4193
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:25,640
Keep talking!

4194
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:27,840
Oh, you're upstairs.

4195
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,440
I'm downstairs.

4196
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:29,420
Yeah, yeah, we're downstairs.

4197
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:30,020
We're downstairs.

4198
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:30,760
Oh, yeah, there.

4199
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:31,360
I see.

4200
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:32,780
Where?

4201
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:34,240
Right here.

4202
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:35,100
Oh, nice.

4203
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:36,100
Oh!

4204
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:36,680
Yeah!

4205
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,720
Okay, now we can explore.

4206
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:39,600
Okay, now...

4207
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,860
Okay, let's go to the TV room, because the monster's not here anymore.

4208
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:44,160
I don't wanna look behind you.

4209
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:44,860
Oh my god.

4210
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:46,080
Okay, there's that guy, though.

4211
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:48,440
Let's go to the TV room.

4212
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:50,200
The third floor.

4213
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:52,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4214
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:52,980
Third floor, third floor.

4215
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:53,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4216
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:54,520
We went up the...

4217
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:56,640
And, like, Mimi and I went up and the monster was gone.

4218
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:58,220
No, I just...

4219
02:21:58,220 --> 02:21:58,860
It was, like, here.

4220
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:01,380
Oh, yeah, here.

4221
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:02,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4222
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:06,900
Don't worry, we did it, guys.

4223
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:08,400
We liberated the third floor.

4224
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:11,100
I don't even know what we're doing, but we're doing it.

4225
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,520
Yeah!

4226
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:12,780
We're giving them the orange.

4227
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:15,040
I know, but I just mean in general.

4228
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:15,640
Like...

4229
02:22:17,580 --> 02:22:19,240
PTSD in these holidays.

4230
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,700
After we found the moon...

4231
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:23,020
Oh, that's how he broke out.

4232
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:24,240
Yeah!

4233
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:27,140
What the heck is that muskash animal?

4234
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:27,980
Where was that?

4235
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:31,000
This school is weird.

4236
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:33,500
I don't...

4237
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:34,700
I don't know, guys.

4238
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:36,120
Is this a school?

4239
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:36,760
Save on the moon.

4240
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:37,700
That's right.

4241
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:38,840
Save on the moon.

4242
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:40,600
Oh, where is he?

4243
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:41,320
TV man!

4244
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:42,600
Oh, there he is!

4245
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:43,100
Look!

4246
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:44,160
I want an orange for you.

4247
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:44,540
Yeah!

4248
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:46,100
Hey!

4249
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:46,560
Hi!

4250
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,180
That guy...

4251
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:51,880
Look at his body.

4252
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,500
He's definitely gonna turn into...

4253
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:53,800
Yeah.

4254
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:55,500
I have a TV instead of a head.

4255
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:55,960
But I'm...

4256
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:56,560
Oh, yeah, okay.

4257
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:57,760
This is all the same thing.

4258
02:22:58,840 --> 02:22:59,800
Does he want it?

4259
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:01,120
Wait, does he not want it?

4260
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:04,240
Is he just here for storytelling reasons?

4261
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:05,860
Wait, he doesn't want the orange?

4262
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:08,900
Maybe it's the wrong one.

4263
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:10,560
Wrong orange thing.

4264
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:10,740
No!

4265
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:13,420
Okay, then we'll just leave it here.

4266
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:14,420
We don't need it, I think.

4267
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:15,820
Alright, let's save.

4268
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,080
We're safe anyway.

4269
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:19,680
Nice.

4270
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:21,300
Alright, so we go outside.

4271
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,980
I'm gonna fall from the third story.

4272
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:26,180
Grab a nap.

4273
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:28,080
Alright, let's go.

4274
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:29,520
Here I go!

4275
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:31,320
Here I go!

4276
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:32,460
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

4277
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:34,280
Where are we going?

4278
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:35,320
We go outside!

4279
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:37,320
Wait, you guys!

4280
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:37,740
What?

4281
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:40,400
I think there's an electrical panel down here.

4282
02:23:40,580 --> 02:23:41,680
Yeah, we have to go outside!

4283
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:42,180
Oh!

4284
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:42,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4285
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:43,620
Remember when...

4286
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:45,560
When we exploded the door?

4287
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:49,120
You think he'll touch us?

4288
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:50,960
With all those baby hands?

4289
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:51,960
I think that one is...

4290
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:52,600
Oh wait!

4291
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:53,540
I can't fall.

4292
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:54,800
I can't walk out the door.

4293
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:55,560
That's like the fence.

4294
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:56,560
You see that fence over there?

4295
02:23:56,660 --> 02:23:58,320
That's where we exploded the dynamite.

4296
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,240
Yeah, I know, but I thought I would be able to fall.

4297
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:02,860
No, you can't.

4298
02:24:02,860 --> 02:24:03,980
No, you can't.

4299
02:24:03,980 --> 02:24:04,760
You can't do a flip.

4300
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:06,260
I tried jumping off earlier.

4301
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:07,760
Alright, it's this way.

4302
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,180
Down we go!

4303
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:20,340
Alright, here we go.

4304
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:21,260
Alright!

4305
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:23,240
Grab that one electrical panel.

4306
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:24,540
Where?

4307
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,840
There's something evil here.

4308
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:29,380
There's something evil.

4309
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,800
I feel like the entire area is evil.

4310
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:33,940
It needs two of them!

4311
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:35,060
Wait, it needs two?

4312
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:36,480
Yeah.

4313
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:38,600
Oh wait, so this is where the other one is.

4314
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:39,640
Oh, the other two!

4315
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:40,200
Yeah!

4316
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:44,460
Oh, this is the top of the same laboratory.

4317
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:44,920
Yeah!

4318
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:47,720
What's this mustache?

4319
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:50,640
You think that...

4320
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,560
I found a shortcut!

4321
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,820
Oh, a shortcut!

4322
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:53,840
Oh, nice!

4323
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:54,320
Let's go!

4324
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:59,220
Where is this area?

4325
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:01,480
Wait, that's our safe room!

4326
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:02,740
It's the safe room area!

4327
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:05,140
This is where we met our...

4328
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:05,220
Yeah!

4329
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:07,280
And the kitten!

4330
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:09,160
Okay, we got...

4331
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:11,380
Maybe the electrical board's on the other side.

4332
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:12,020
Remember, there's...

4333
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:13,000
There's that side too.

4334
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:18,360
And we go on the other side.

4335
02:25:24,210 --> 02:25:25,010
Anything here?

4336
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:27,550
Wait, there's another area here.

4337
02:25:30,330 --> 02:25:31,410
Have we been here?

4338
02:25:32,670 --> 02:25:33,530
I don't know.

4339
02:25:33,690 --> 02:25:34,130
Everything looks as...

4340
02:25:34,130 --> 02:25:34,490
I don't know.

4341
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:35,730
Everything looks as...

4342
02:25:35,730 --> 02:25:35,950
Oh!

4343
02:25:36,130 --> 02:25:36,490
Oh!

4344
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:46,940
Are we good?

4345
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:47,380
I...

4346
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:50,200
Oh, no!

4347
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:51,000
Oh, no!

4348
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:52,220
Maybe...

4349
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:53,680
Wait, is that Min on the other side?

4350
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:54,720
Wait, Min's gonna die.

4351
02:25:57,180 --> 02:25:57,580
Okay.

4352
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:59,060
Oh, she didn't think she's fine.

4353
02:25:59,220 --> 02:25:59,380
I see.

4354
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:01,300
I think she might have got infected.

4355
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:02,620
Wait, is she infected?

4356
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:04,060
Did she...

4357
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:05,060
Wait, we should...

4358
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:06,600
Wait...

4359
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,560
Oh, no, she's okay.

4360
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,240
She's okay.

4361
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:08,960
Oh, okay.

4362
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:12,160
I like how Nimi...

4363
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:12,440
The...

4364
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:15,140
Nimi's infected body chased after you.

4365
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:18,020
Wait, is there a safe point over here?

4366
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:19,840
You would say she's...

4367
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:20,820
My nightmare.

4368
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,820
Alright, let's go...

4369
02:26:25,820 --> 02:26:26,160
Uh...

4370
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:26,820
Let's go...

4371
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:27,540
To safe point.

4372
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:28,460
Where's the safe point here?

4373
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:30,120
Are you just sitting?

4374
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:31,460
You can sit here?

4375
02:26:31,460 --> 02:26:31,700
Yeah.

4376
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:33,380
I'm just, you know...

4377
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:33,720
Thinking.

4378
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:35,020
Just thinking.

4379
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:36,660
Next to Nimi's dead body.

4380
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,800
You know, it's been a long night.

4381
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:39,280
Yeah.

4382
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:40,560
You can take a little breather.

4383
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:40,940
Yeah.

4384
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:43,260
I'm also gonna...

4385
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:44,620
I'm gonna do something to relax.

4386
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:45,920
Take the nerves off.

4387
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:47,160
I hear that.

4388
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:47,980
Clint.

4389
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,960
Dance for us.

4390
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:50,220
Yes.

4391
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,880
I released the dopamine.

4392
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:54,020
Yeah, I released it.

4393
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:54,800
This is just how I think, you know?

4394
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:55,920
Yeah, yeah.

4395
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:56,900
Let me...

4396
02:26:56,900 --> 02:26:58,200
At least it's in stress, you know?

4397
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:00,520
Me too.

4398
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:01,500
Yeah, I feel that.

4399
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:04,660
I gotta do a little flip to...

4400
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:05,660
To feel better.

4401
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:08,280
Alright, where's the...

4402
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:10,280
I just witnessed my friend's death in front of my house.

4403
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:11,500
Where's the safe point for here?

4404
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:12,060
I forgot.

4405
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:13,180
Isn't it by the basement?

4406
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:14,120
Like this way?

4407
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:14,760
Is it?

4408
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:15,140
Oh, yeah.

4409
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:16,560
Oh, the other way, other way.

4410
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:17,300
There's the basement.

4411
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:17,900
Oh, wait!

4412
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:18,620
There's...

4413
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:18,940
No, yeah.

4414
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:19,740
There's...

4415
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,140
There should be, like, one more.

4416
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:24,340
I...

4417
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:25,120
Can't remember.

4418
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:25,720
Oh, wait!

4419
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:26,020
No, no!

4420
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:26,800
You're right, Doobie!

4421
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:27,300
You're right!

4422
02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:28,980
It's the easier one.

4423
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:30,440
Sorry.

4424
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:31,280
Don't listen to me.

4425
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:32,240
Yeah.

4426
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:34,240
Always listen to the yellows.

4427
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:35,720
It was this right here.

4428
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:36,340
Yeah, here.

4429
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:37,240
Found it.

4430
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:40,300
Sorry.

4431
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:41,520
Alright, welcome back.

4432
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,600
Welcome back.

4433
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:44,320
Hello.

4434
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:46,600
You like how we danced on top of your dead body?

4435
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:48,100
Yeah.

4436
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,560
Maybe.

4437
02:27:49,860 --> 02:27:50,960
It was a way to grieve.

4438
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,720
Not able to pass into the afterlife.

4439
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:56,240
Wait, guys.

4440
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:56,960
Where are you guys going?

4441
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:57,900
We have to go this way.

4442
02:27:58,140 --> 02:27:58,160
Tell me about it.

4443
02:27:58,160 --> 02:27:58,420
Tell me about it.

4444
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:02,060
What can I do for you today?

4445
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:05,500
I'm looking for an electrical panel.

4446
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:06,800
Yeah, we're looking...

4447
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:07,140
Oh, I...

4448
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:09,580
I think it's somewhere, like, on the left side.

4449
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:10,780
I'm thinking, like, over there.

4450
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:12,140
Oh, can you...

4451
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:15,600
Um, and can you recommend me some restaurants nearby?

4452
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:18,200
Yeah, we haven't...

4453
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:18,920
There's no food.

4454
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:20,400
Maybe we're robots.

4455
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:21,480
Just like that robot lady.

4456
02:28:21,960 --> 02:28:23,060
Oh, what if we're just...

4457
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:24,420
Oh, what if we're just cyborgs?

4458
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:27,020
Sent to space.

4459
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:28,460
Where...

4460
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:29,420
How are they now?

4461
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:30,660
Wait, where are you guys going?

4462
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:32,080
We have to go out this way.

4463
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:33,380
We do?

4464
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:33,820
Yeah.

4465
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:35,180
Remember when the...

4466
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:36,160
Oh, do you look at the walkthrough?

4467
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:36,900
Yeah.

4468
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:38,940
When they go through the...

4469
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:40,500
The area where Nivi died.

4470
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:41,700
Oh.

4471
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:44,020
Yeah, it was like...

4472
02:28:44,020 --> 02:28:44,620
Right here.

4473
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,380
Okay, you go first.

4474
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:47,000
You got the flashlight.

4475
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:53,660
Going back.

4476
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:54,720
Uh-oh.

4477
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:55,220
Uh-oh.

4478
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:55,800
Uh-oh.

4479
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:09,300
Wait, should we go rest her again?

4480
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:10,540
He spawned camping.

4481
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:11,420
Yeah.

4482
02:29:16,970 --> 02:29:18,170
Okay, she's gone.

4483
02:29:18,390 --> 02:29:20,130
Let's revive her, I guess.

4484
02:29:20,530 --> 02:29:21,610
Let's revive her, I guess.

4485
02:29:23,810 --> 02:29:24,490
Oh, wait.

4486
02:29:24,810 --> 02:29:26,210
I went the wrong way, sorry.

4487
02:29:26,830 --> 02:29:29,630
I didn't even get a chance to react.

4488
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:32,630
I didn't even get a chance to react.

4489
02:29:35,450 --> 02:29:36,690
He's right...

4490
02:29:36,690 --> 02:29:39,150
Guys, he's right behind me, isn't he?

4491
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:49,430
Oh my god, he's here now.

4492
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:50,710
Okay, he's here now, he's here now.

4493
02:29:51,430 --> 02:29:52,330
He's here, he's here.

4494
02:29:53,390 --> 02:29:53,710
Where?

4495
02:29:54,730 --> 02:29:55,390
I saw him.

4496
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:55,990
Yeah, he is here.

4497
02:29:56,130 --> 02:29:57,350
He's directly in front of us.

4498
02:29:57,350 --> 02:29:59,030
Okay, so we should be able to go now.

4499
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:01,450
We should be able to go now.

4500
02:30:01,450 --> 02:30:02,610
What if there's more than one?

4501
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:04,370
I think there's only one.

4502
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:05,510
There could be more than one.

4503
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:06,810
Wait, do we go here?

4504
02:30:07,330 --> 02:30:08,030
I think...

4505
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:08,710
He's right there.

4506
02:30:08,810 --> 02:30:09,310
He's right there.

4507
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:09,830
He's right there.

4508
02:30:12,310 --> 02:30:13,170
Okay, we go here.

4509
02:30:13,310 --> 02:30:14,410
Maybe we just go this way.

4510
02:30:14,530 --> 02:30:15,790
Guys, let's just go this side.

4511
02:30:19,230 --> 02:30:20,630
Okay, we'll just go here.

4512
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:23,050
Oh, I don't know that.

4513
02:30:23,230 --> 02:30:23,450
Like that.

4514
02:30:23,590 --> 02:30:25,110
Guys, I think we have to go this way.

4515
02:30:25,770 --> 02:30:26,070
Guys.

4516
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:28,210
Guys, we just go this way.

4517
02:30:29,050 --> 02:30:30,070
I remember this...

4518
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:31,250
We've actually been here already.

4519
02:30:31,490 --> 02:30:32,630
We've been to this area already.

4520
02:30:34,050 --> 02:30:41,430
That was where the... that was the cafeteria where we opened when we had to go outside the first time.

4521
02:30:41,570 --> 02:30:43,030
There's like that second one.

4522
02:30:43,290 --> 02:30:44,550
Oh, this is new.

4523
02:30:44,570 --> 02:30:46,370
Yeah, this is the new area, right?

4524
02:30:47,130 --> 02:30:47,890
And there's evil creatures.

4525
02:30:47,890 --> 02:30:48,970
Yeah, I got a steam achievement.

4526
02:30:49,470 --> 02:30:50,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.

4527
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:52,230
Where do we go now?

4528
02:30:52,470 --> 02:30:54,550
Oh, open the gates to the surrounding area.

4529
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:57,570
We still need to find an electrical board.

4530
02:30:57,690 --> 02:30:58,190
Oh, save point!

4531
02:30:58,630 --> 02:30:59,410
Save point!

4532
02:30:59,570 --> 02:31:00,190
Our girlfriend!

4533
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:00,910
Our girlfriend!

4534
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,990
Oh, there she is!

4535
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:03,110
Mommy!

4536
02:31:03,210 --> 02:31:03,730
Mommy!

4537
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:06,210
Oh, I found another open gate.

4538
02:31:06,990 --> 02:31:08,610
Are you planning to go inside the annex?

4539
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:11,150
What's the annex?

4540
02:31:11,630 --> 02:31:11,970
Uh, yes?

4541
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:13,530
No, there are...

4542
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:14,490
Get over here!

4543
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:15,770
Stop talking to your girlfriend!

4544
02:31:15,930 --> 02:31:16,490
We have to save!

4545
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:18,070
I'm learning the lore!

4546
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:20,370
We gotta save!

4547
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:21,650
Many of them went there.

4548
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:24,410
But I haven't seen anyone who came back from there.

4549
02:31:24,430 --> 02:31:25,810
There's a monster around the corner!

4550
02:31:26,330 --> 02:31:26,630
Oh, okay.

4551
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:27,750
I've tried.

4552
02:31:29,090 --> 02:31:30,070
She disappeared!

4553
02:31:32,170 --> 02:31:34,630
Look how we're all spamming the same game.

4554
02:31:34,630 --> 02:31:36,690
Wait, we're going into a new building, that's why.

4555
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:38,250
Oh.

4556
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:40,450
We go in here?

4557
02:31:41,170 --> 02:31:41,470
Yeah.

4558
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:42,650
Oh.

4559
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:43,910
Oh.

4560
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:45,830
Oh.

4561
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:45,930
Uh-oh.

4562
02:31:45,970 --> 02:31:46,470
I don't like it.

4563
02:31:46,590 --> 02:31:47,050
I don't like it.

4564
02:31:47,170 --> 02:31:47,550
I don't like it.

4565
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:48,990
I hear somebody breathing.

4566
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:49,930
Me too.

4567
02:31:51,410 --> 02:31:52,970
I don't see anything on my scanner.

4568
02:31:54,090 --> 02:31:54,650
It looks clear.

4569
02:31:54,670 --> 02:31:55,470
It looks clear.

4570
02:31:55,810 --> 02:31:56,730
Maybe he's gone.

4571
02:31:56,990 --> 02:31:59,130
Yeah, maybe he just, he got scared away.

4572
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:00,910
From us.

4573
02:32:01,210 --> 02:32:01,970
Yeah, we're spooky.

4574
02:32:01,970 --> 02:32:02,670
And we're a bunch of baddies.

4575
02:32:04,310 --> 02:32:05,610
This looks familiar.

4576
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:07,630
This does look a little familiar.

4577
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:13,700
Everything looks familiar.

4578
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:14,260
Yeah.

4579
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,240
Oh.

4580
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,440
Wait, there's a, guys!

4581
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:19,620
There's another door here!

4582
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:25,480
There's a, there, it says I need people to be here.

4583
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:26,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4584
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:28,840
Wait, one, two, three...

4585
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:30,580
Wait, we're missing one.

4586
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,360
Oh, there we go.

4587
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:31,840
Okay, here, here.

4588
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:32,220
Me.

4589
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:34,720
Oh.

4590
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:36,700
Explore the annex, okay.

4591
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:37,560
Okay.

4592
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:40,100
Is this the annex?

4593
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:42,840
Yeah, but there's a breathing man in here.

4594
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:44,360
Hello!

4595
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:45,700
Hey, that's a friend!

4596
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:46,340
Oh!

4597
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,100
Was that her waifu?

4598
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:49,900
Oh, no.

4599
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:51,360
That wasn't.

4600
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,880
That's, that's her ex!

4601
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:57,780
The man she tells you not to worry about.

4602
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:03,840
Oh, we just watched our comrade die in front of her.

4603
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:05,580
Oh!

4604
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:06,300
Oh!

4605
02:33:06,980 --> 02:33:07,100
Oh!

4606
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:07,520
Oh!

4607
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:19,620
Okay, I got the data on the map.

4608
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:19,880
Oh!

4609
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:20,820
Hello!

4610
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:24,120
They live?

4611
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,140
You think you're alive?

4612
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:40,420
Guys?

4613
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:42,040
Hey!

4614
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:43,040
Did...

4615
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:43,900
Yubi die?

4616
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:45,740
Yeah, I watched her die.

4617
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:46,100
Oh!

4618
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:47,820
I was like how...

4619
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:50,560
It approached Nimi from behind.

4620
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:52,860
Yeah, I know.

4621
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:53,420
Wait!

4622
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:54,960
Hello?

4623
02:33:55,180 --> 02:33:55,760
Did you hear that?

4624
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:56,920
Hello?

4625
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:58,080
Oh!

4626
02:33:58,280 --> 02:33:58,660
Nimi!

4627
02:33:58,820 --> 02:34:00,100
Nimi, you're alive?!

4628
02:34:00,100 --> 02:34:00,700
I'm alive!

4629
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:04,460
I thought I killed you!

4630
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:05,600
I ran.

4631
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:06,900
Wait, what?

4632
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:09,020
Oh!

4633
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:11,240
Oh, so it almost...

4634
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:13,580
Okay.

4635
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:14,460
Go, go, go!

4636
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:15,700
Go, go, go!

4637
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:18,660
Go, go, go!

4638
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:21,940
I don't think it can open doors.

4639
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:27,600
Okay, I feel like how none of us closed the door after I said that.

4640
02:34:28,940 --> 02:34:33,100
Um, well, you know, it is what it is.

4641
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:37,080
Okay, we should be fine.

4642
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:39,460
We need to find a rest point for Doobie.

4643
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:44,680
Yeah, me too.

4644
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,260
But he goes around, though.

4645
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:50,860
One of the capsules is located in the... How big?

4646
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:51,380
Ouch!

4647
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,000
How long is this game?

4648
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:58,100
I thought after we open the laboratory, if we, we, like, discover the moon and it'll be over.

4649
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:03,600
I don't hear him.

4650
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:04,700
Should I open up the house?

4651
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:05,220
Okay.

4652
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:08,840
I think we're fine.

4653
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:14,180
I don't know where to go, guys.

4654
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:16,180
I don't know either.

4655
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:18,640
Where's that?

4656
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:21,340
Oh!

4657
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:22,200
Oh!

4658
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:22,940
Oh!

4659
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:23,140
Oh!

4660
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:32,980
I'm alive!

4661
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:34,140
I'm alive!

4662
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:34,800
I'm not alive!

4663
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:35,400
I'm not alive!

4664
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:37,100
I'm not alive!

4665
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:37,400
Hey!

4666
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:38,320
I'm not alive!

4667
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:44,700
Where the fuck is the capsule?

4668
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:52,340
Oh my god, we gotta push this capsule so far, DB.

4669
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:54,860
Why do we have to push it so far?

4670
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,020
Okay, wait, I can... Oh, it's here, here.

4671
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:58,600
This is a shortcut.

4672
02:35:58,760 --> 02:35:59,060
This is shorter.

4673
02:35:59,400 --> 02:35:59,860
Amy, right here.

4674
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,280
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

4675
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:03,440
No, I don't think he can fit it.

4676
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:04,080
He's too thick.

4677
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:05,600
He's too...

4678
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:06,800
He's too thick.

4679
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:07,420
We'll be fine.

4680
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:08,520
We'll be fine.

4681
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:10,680
Oh, he's right, he's right!

4682
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:11,440
He fits, he fits, he fits!

4683
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,320
He's all that thick!

4684
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:12,900
Oh!

4685
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:20,320
Oh my god, he's right behind me, isn't he?

4686
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:24,960
Oh my god, he's too thick!

4687
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:25,820
Oh my god, he's too thick!

4688
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:30,740
Oh my god,

4689
02:36:35,570 --> 02:36:38,190
he's too thick!

4690
02:36:39,810 --> 02:36:40,510
Oh my god!

4691
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:40,530
Oh my god!

4692
02:36:40,530 --> 02:36:40,550
Oh my god!

4693
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:40,930
Oh my god!

4694
02:36:40,930 --> 02:36:41,130
Oh my god!

4695
02:36:41,290 --> 02:36:43,470
Oh my god!

4696
02:36:43,470 --> 02:36:43,590
Oh my god!

4697
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:43,930
Oh my god!

4698
02:36:45,690 --> 02:36:46,370
Oh my god!

4699
02:36:48,430 --> 02:36:52,690
Oh my god!

4700
02:36:52,690 --> 02:36:55,610
He does, he does, he can open the door, he can open the door!

4701
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:13,900
Oh my god, why is he still there?

4702
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:22,940
How do we get it so fast?

4703
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:26,140
One of us has to be bait.

4704
02:37:26,380 --> 02:37:28,320
One of us has to be bait while the other pushes.

4705
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:37,480
Oh my god!

4706
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:38,120
Oh my god!

4707
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:40,760
Oh, I just saw me cookie and squash!

4708
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:45,620
Should I?

4709
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:48,760
You're alive!

4710
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:49,820
How did you live?

4711
02:37:53,320 --> 02:37:55,660
Oh my god!

4712
02:37:55,660 --> 02:37:59,340
Oh my god!

4713
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:01,260
Oh, I'm fucking leaving!

4714
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:02,980
I'm fucking leaving!

4715
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:06,900
Oh my god, there has to be a save point somewhere!

4716
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:09,100
Oh my god!

4717
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:12,460
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me!

4718
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,900
Oh my god, I scared the shit out of me!

4719
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:16,840
Oh my god, I'll come back everyone!

4720
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:18,200
I was looking back at the speed!

4721
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:20,440
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look back guys!

4722
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:23,600
We're back!

4723
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:24,340
We're back!

4724
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:26,160
Okay, okay, I...

4725
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:28,000
Oh my god, that guy was sick!

4726
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,440
This guy is kind of insane!

4727
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:31,920
Yeah, bro, look at him jumping everywhere!

4728
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:32,680
I know!

4729
02:38:32,740 --> 02:38:34,700
You were doing a good job, like, uh...

4730
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:35,440
Dodging him!

4731
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:36,080
I know!

4732
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:37,280
I did!

4733
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:38,980
What if you have that debate?

4734
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:40,000
And we'll put...

4735
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:40,020
Yeah!

4736
02:38:40,120 --> 02:38:40,420
Okay, alright!

4737
02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:41,840
You're so good at dodging him!

4738
02:38:42,340 --> 02:38:43,320
Alright, yes!

4739
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:44,560
Okay, wait, wait, here, here, here, here!

4740
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:45,720
Push here, push here, push here!

4741
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:47,700
It's in here!

4742
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:49,200
Push here, and then you push out from here!

4743
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:50,000
In the front!

4744
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,040
Don't worry, guys, I'll distract him!

4745
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:53,920
Don't worry, Doobie and I got this!

4746
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:56,440
I don't think they got...

4747
02:38:56,440 --> 02:38:57,720
God, he's behind us!

4748
02:38:58,220 --> 02:38:58,840
Who is that?

4749
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:00,340
He's on Nimi!

4750
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:01,860
Oh, okay, let's push it, let's push it!

4751
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:02,320
He's on Nimi!

4752
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:04,780
Let's push it, let's push it!

4753
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:08,060
Oh, I pushed it around!

4754
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:08,980
You're getting in a corner!

4755
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:09,920
You're getting in a corner!

4756
02:39:10,140 --> 02:39:10,680
I fucked up, I fucked up!

4757
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:11,380
I got scared!

4758
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:12,640
I got scared!

4759
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:14,340
Okay, hold on, hold on!

4760
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:14,700
Okay, okay!

4761
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:16,480
Okay!

4762
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:16,880
Push?

4763
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:17,520
Yeah!

4764
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:18,920
There we go!

4765
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:21,480
It's just...

4766
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:22,300
Wait, Nimi, Nimi!

4767
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:23,200
There's...

4768
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:24,620
Okay, okay, that's good.

4769
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:25,440
We can push it out, right?

4770
02:39:26,980 --> 02:39:29,220
Uh, she's no longer distracting him.

4771
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:30,860
So we don't know where he is.

4772
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:32,740
I wonder where Doobie is!

4773
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:34,080
Maybe Doobie's got him!

4774
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:35,280
Oh my god, he's a friend!

4775
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:35,780
He's a friend!

4776
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:39,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

4777
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:41,140
Where is he?

4778
02:39:41,380 --> 02:39:41,960
Where is he?

4779
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:43,100
Where is he?

4780
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,320
I pushed it!

4781
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:03,740
I pushed it!

4782
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:04,180
I pushed it!

4783
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:07,420
I pushed it!

4784
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:11,700
Guys, I pushed it!

4785
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:17,020
Where is the other capsule?

4786
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:22,000
Where is the other capsule?

4787
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,100
Where is the other capsule?

4788
02:40:25,180 --> 02:40:26,240
Where are you guys okay?

4789
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:32,780
What does it mean?

4790
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:35,100
One of the capsule is in the industrial building!

4791
02:40:35,240 --> 02:40:36,020
What does that mean?

4792
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:38,340
Are you pushing it?

4793
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:38,740
I did it!

4794
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:39,180
I did it!

4795
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:39,460
I did one of them!

4796
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:40,980
But one of them is in the industrial building!

4797
02:40:41,080 --> 02:40:41,640
Okay, we gotta save!

4798
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:42,540
We gotta go to the save point!

4799
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:43,380
I'm gonna go to the save point!

4800
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:43,960
Safe!

4801
02:40:43,980 --> 02:40:44,220
Okay!

4802
02:40:44,480 --> 02:40:45,980
Wait, but is Nimi and Doobie alive?

4803
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:48,660
Uh, Nimi was last alive when I saw her.

4804
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,580
Oh, okay.

4805
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:50,920
Oh, but...

4806
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:52,320
Maybe she'll know to go if we...

4807
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:52,540
Wait, wait!

4808
02:40:52,660 --> 02:40:53,020
Come, come here!

4809
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:53,280
Come here!

4810
02:40:53,360 --> 02:40:53,820
Save point!

4811
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:55,200
Come to the save point!

4812
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:56,060
Come to the save point!

4813
02:40:58,460 --> 02:40:58,940
Um...

4814
02:40:58,940 --> 02:40:59,520
Right side!

4815
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:00,360
Or you could...

4816
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:01,500
Or you could die!

4817
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:02,520
Or not!

4818
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:03,960
Just...

4819
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:04,440
Just...

4820
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:05,100
Just die!

4821
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:07,540
Nimi can be saved!

4822
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:11,100
Okay, we're here.

4823
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,560
I'll say...

4824
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:14,560
Mint said wanted you to be dead.

4825
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:15,800
I was like...

4826
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:16,020
Oh!

4827
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,160
Just so we could revive easily.

4828
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:19,400
Okay, wait.

4829
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:19,960
Where is the...

4830
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:22,860
Yeah, it says one of those in the industrial building.

4831
02:41:22,980 --> 02:41:24,780
Where the fuck is the industrial building?

4832
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:26,540
Yeah, I pushed one of the capsules.

4833
02:41:26,600 --> 02:41:27,640
Where to find the other building?

4834
02:41:29,740 --> 02:41:30,620
All the way?

4835
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:31,320
Huh?

4836
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:32,240
I don't know.

4837
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:33,800
This looks industrial.

4838
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:34,760
Does this look like...

4839
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:35,420
It does look industrial.

4840
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:37,980
Hello, are you the industrial building?

4841
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:38,360
Oh!

4842
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:39,660
Nice.

4843
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:40,660
Oh, it is industrial.

4844
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:42,060
There's a cat over here though.

4845
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:43,380
One of the kitty cats guys.

4846
02:41:43,380 --> 02:41:46,520
Meow, meow.

4847
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:47,500
I hear a breathing man.

4848
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:48,400
Report from squad.

4849
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:48,980
Oh, yeah.

4850
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,320
Complete disaster, guys.

4851
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:52,880
Squad, two teams, they've turned into some kind of monsters.

4852
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:54,740
Moving on all fours and they go...

4853
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:55,120
Oh, my god.

4854
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:55,940
They're enormous.

4855
02:41:57,120 --> 02:41:58,140
We'll lose everyone.

4856
02:41:58,520 --> 02:41:58,620
We'll lose everyone.

4857
02:41:58,620 --> 02:41:58,740
Guys.

4858
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:00,380
We decided to send one person northwest.

4859
02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:01,860
Let them try to find something, anything.

4860
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:04,520
The rest of us are all falling back to the building to search for clues there.

4861
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,500
Hopefully this will work.

4862
02:42:05,720 --> 02:42:06,420
Over and out.

4863
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:07,360
Over and out.

4864
02:42:07,360 --> 02:42:08,000
Over and out.

4865
02:42:08,180 --> 02:42:08,600
Don't worry.

4866
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:09,800
We're better than that squad.

4867
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:11,720
Yeah, we're squad.

4868
02:42:11,900 --> 02:42:12,640
We're Mickey 17.

4869
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:13,860
Guys, there's three of them.

4870
02:42:14,320 --> 02:42:15,460
There's three of them.

4871
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:15,640
There's three of them.

4872
02:42:15,640 --> 02:42:16,460
Guys, there's four of them.

4873
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:17,640
A cloud with four of them.

4874
02:42:17,720 --> 02:42:17,880
Four of them.

4875
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:21,220
How are we gonna push the capsule all the way back?

4876
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:21,440
Oh, he's coming.

4877
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:21,840
He's coming.

4878
02:42:22,040 --> 02:42:22,320
He's coming.

4879
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:22,760
He's coming.

4880
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:24,160
It's not safe.

4881
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:25,140
It's not safe.

4882
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:26,440
It's not safe.

4883
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:31,000
Poor that guy just walked in.

4884
02:42:32,480 --> 02:42:33,620
It's his home.

4885
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:34,520
Yeah.

4886
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:37,780
What is all this noise going on?

4887
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:39,620
Hey, there's a key behind you.

4888
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:40,480
Huh.

4889
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:45,100
I think the lizard guy is friendly.

4890
02:42:47,220 --> 02:42:48,640
How did he seize us?

4891
02:42:49,820 --> 02:42:51,500
I think he sees us.

4892
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,220
I think he sees us.

4893
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,400
I don't know.

4894
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:57,940
Oh shoot.

4895
02:42:58,540 --> 02:42:59,520
Wait, okay, I'm gonna be here.

4896
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:02,420
Wait, no, they're all... Oh my god, they're all surrounded.

4897
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:04,440
I think they both died.

4898
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:06,260
Let's revive them.

4899
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,760
Um... I don't think so.

4900
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:14,820
I... I don't think they're okay.

4901
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:17,640
I don't think...

4902
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:19,140
Wait, what happened to Min?

4903
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:20,640
Wait, is Min alive?

4904
02:43:30,180 --> 02:43:32,780
You've been screaming in the background.

4905
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:34,560
It's okay, I'll be a hero.

4906
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:39,040
One of... I'll wait until...

4907
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,400
She'll die eventually, right?

4908
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:55,290
What the fuck is heavy breathing?

4909
02:43:58,710 --> 02:43:59,190
Oh!

4910
02:43:59,390 --> 02:44:01,110
Oh my god, it's the sentity, man.

4911
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:02,670
Oh, hey!

4912
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:03,490
Welcome back!

4913
02:44:03,870 --> 02:44:06,430
Oh wait, we gotta wait for Min to die again.

4914
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:08,630
Oops.

4915
02:44:09,210 --> 02:44:09,790
Oops.

4916
02:44:11,410 --> 02:44:12,650
Oh my god.

4917
02:44:14,070 --> 02:44:14,630
Um...

4918
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:16,590
All I wanted to do was...

4919
02:44:16,590 --> 02:44:17,430
Free the moon.

4920
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:20,430
I thought we were so close.

4921
02:44:20,430 --> 02:44:20,970
We're gonna do it.

4922
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:21,730
It's possible.

4923
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:23,410
30 more minutes.

4924
02:44:23,690 --> 02:44:25,010
We just... We can do this.

4925
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:26,810
We can save the moon.

4926
02:44:27,250 --> 02:44:27,970
Welcome back.

4927
02:44:28,710 --> 02:44:29,790
We need the gun.

4928
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:30,450
There's...

4929
02:44:30,450 --> 02:44:31,050
We need the...

4930
02:44:31,050 --> 02:44:31,350
There's...

4931
02:44:31,350 --> 02:44:32,110
There's goo...

4932
02:44:32,110 --> 02:44:32,710
There's goo all.

4933
02:44:32,930 --> 02:44:33,430
Okay, okay.

4934
02:44:33,650 --> 02:44:35,310
So then we have to...

4935
02:44:35,850 --> 02:44:36,910
We have to...

4936
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:37,630
We can get it in here.

4937
02:44:37,950 --> 02:44:38,670
In the building.

4938
02:44:39,090 --> 02:44:39,230
Yeah, we can get it in here.

4939
02:44:39,250 --> 02:44:39,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4940
02:44:41,150 --> 02:44:43,190
Alright, someone grab the goo gun.

4941
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:45,590
Oh, I got it.

4942
02:44:45,730 --> 02:44:46,550
I got the lab.

4943
02:44:46,630 --> 02:44:47,730
Can we enter through here?

4944
02:44:48,630 --> 02:44:49,610
I don't think so.

4945
02:44:49,610 --> 02:44:50,470
Wait.

4946
02:44:50,510 --> 02:44:53,590
If you walk pretty close to them, it seems like they can't jump on you.

4947
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,470
So it's a little easier.

4948
02:44:55,030 --> 02:44:55,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4949
02:44:55,790 --> 02:44:56,650
Yeah, it's in this building.

4950
02:44:56,990 --> 02:44:57,270
Okay.

4951
02:44:59,490 --> 02:45:02,430
I've yet to see one electrical board, guys.

4952
02:45:02,730 --> 02:45:03,490
I don't know.

4953
02:45:03,650 --> 02:45:05,230
I don't think we're still...

4954
02:45:05,230 --> 02:45:06,190
Maybe the end game, right?

4955
02:45:06,550 --> 02:45:07,710
It must be, yeah.

4956
02:45:10,050 --> 02:45:10,390
Alright.

4957
02:45:11,550 --> 02:45:12,410
Oh my god.

4958
02:45:12,470 --> 02:45:13,210
Look at her go.

4959
02:45:13,530 --> 02:45:13,830
Ah!

4960
02:45:20,010 --> 02:45:21,810
I'm gonna use the bathroom, guys.

4961
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:24,330
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4962
02:45:24,890 --> 02:45:25,390
You

4963
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:42,180
did.

4964
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:43,700
Did you shoot the goo?

4965
02:45:44,120 --> 02:45:45,160
Yeah, I shot it.

4966
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:46,060
I think we got it.

4967
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:47,340
I think we got it.

4968
02:45:50,420 --> 02:45:52,600
That's probably what the goo gun was for.

4969
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:53,160
Maybe?

4970
02:45:55,700 --> 02:45:56,760
Is there an exit?

4971
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:03,080
Oh, there we go!

4972
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:04,020
Yay!

4973
02:46:06,140 --> 02:46:25,800
Push-a-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-push-p I got it.

4974
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:29,040
I'm back.

4975
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:37,140
I was busy watching Mint do her fucking heroic parkour that one of the cats jumped on top of me.

4976
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:41,940
Okay, I remember the deer guy.

4977
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:42,500
Okay.

4978
02:46:42,820 --> 02:46:43,660
He's to our right.

4979
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:45,100
Wait, this way's faster.

4980
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:45,840
This way's faster.

4981
02:46:46,980 --> 02:46:47,300
Okay.

4982
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:47,960
Yeah, yeah.

4983
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:48,600
This way.

4984
02:46:49,380 --> 02:46:50,880
He's actually kind of over there.

4985
02:46:51,100 --> 02:46:52,280
Pusha, pusha, pusha, pusha.

4986
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:53,880
It's okay.

4987
02:46:53,880 --> 02:46:53,940
Okay.

4988
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:55,340
In here?

4989
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:57,260
There's on my scanner.

4990
02:46:59,580 --> 02:47:00,380
I hear him.

4991
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:02,640
It's here.

4992
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:02,900
Oh, this way?

4993
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:03,220
In here?

4994
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:03,880
Yeah, yeah.

4995
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:05,660
Is he coming?

4996
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:07,580
Okay, one of us conveyed him.

4997
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:12,380
Wait, you keep pushing because I don't know which way.

4998
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:14,480
You push in the left, yeah.

4999
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:16,600
Okay, okay.

5000
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:17,120
Okay, okay.

5001
02:47:18,060 --> 02:47:19,860
No, no, no.

5002
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:20,300
It's on the left.

5003
02:47:20,340 --> 02:47:22,020
Okay, that works too, that works too, that works too.

5004
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:23,600
Yeah, yeah.

5005
02:47:26,990 --> 02:47:29,090
You're doing me calling him a stupid idiot.

5006
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:33,210
Okay, we did it.

5007
02:47:33,430 --> 02:47:34,390
Oh, what'd we get?

5008
02:47:34,970 --> 02:47:35,650
I don't know.

5009
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:36,610
Is this an electrical board?

5010
02:47:36,750 --> 02:47:37,210
Yes, it is.

5011
02:47:37,270 --> 02:47:38,630
Oh my god, we got an electrical board.

5012
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:39,130
Let's go!

5013
02:47:40,150 --> 02:47:41,430
Okay, we gotta...

5014
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:42,710
Wait, is this to the thing though?

5015
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:43,530
Here, here, come here, come here.

5016
02:47:43,610 --> 02:47:44,190
This way, this way.

5017
02:47:44,230 --> 02:47:46,130
This is electrical board, not electrical box.

5018
02:47:46,430 --> 02:47:47,230
That's what this is.

5019
02:47:47,970 --> 02:47:48,690
Electrical box.

5020
02:47:49,270 --> 02:47:51,110
Oh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

5021
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:53,990
Goodbye.

5022
02:47:54,610 --> 02:47:55,570
I went...

5023
02:47:55,570 --> 02:47:56,310
Oh, I'm dead.

5024
02:47:56,470 --> 02:47:56,830
I'm dead!

5025
02:47:57,230 --> 02:47:57,970
I'm dead!

5026
02:48:03,390 --> 02:48:03,870
Hello?

5027
02:48:07,210 --> 02:48:08,190
No, I have it!

5028
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:09,050
I have the box!

5029
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:09,970
I have the box!

5030
02:48:11,550 --> 02:48:12,610
I have the box!

5031
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:14,090
How'd you get it?

5032
02:48:14,290 --> 02:48:14,710
I don't know.

5033
02:48:16,390 --> 02:48:17,670
I don't fucking know.

5034
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:18,750
Can't be everyone here.

5035
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:20,210
I think Doobie's dead.

5036
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,410
There.

5037
02:48:21,770 --> 02:48:22,590
There you go.

5038
02:48:23,530 --> 02:48:25,210
Wait, why don't we put this box in?

5039
02:48:26,470 --> 02:48:27,690
Activate the elevator...

5040
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:29,810
Oh, the elevator in the industrial building.

5041
02:48:30,150 --> 02:48:30,530
Industrial building.

5042
02:48:30,730 --> 02:48:33,070
So this goes in one of the industrial buildings.

5043
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:35,750
Wait, how did you get that?

5044
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:36,770
I don't know.

5045
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:40,770
I dropped it in a dead end.

5046
02:48:41,630 --> 02:48:42,030
I dropped it in a dead end.

5047
02:48:42,570 --> 02:48:43,790
I have two, maybe?

5048
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:46,590
No, no, no.

5049
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:47,210
It was one.

5050
02:48:48,390 --> 02:48:50,370
Wait, so where's the other industrial building?

5051
02:48:51,210 --> 02:48:52,870
Oh, oh, oh, yep, yep.

5052
02:48:53,170 --> 02:48:54,330
Uh, aren't there three here?

5053
02:48:54,510 --> 02:48:55,070
There's four.

5054
02:48:55,350 --> 02:48:56,710
Nah, I think there's...

5055
02:48:58,250 --> 02:48:58,650
Uh...

5056
02:48:58,650 --> 02:49:02,550
Yeah, okay, so we gotta find one of the power supplies and put this on.

5057
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:03,930
Okay.

5058
02:49:04,110 --> 02:49:05,530
And one of the industrial buildings.

5059
02:49:06,890 --> 02:49:07,490
There's another...

5060
02:49:07,490 --> 02:49:08,610
A goo wall.

5061
02:49:08,810 --> 02:49:09,850
There's another goo wall in front of us.

5062
02:49:09,850 --> 02:49:10,970
Oh, maybe that's where it is.

5063
02:49:11,150 --> 02:49:11,550
Okay, okay.

5064
02:49:11,710 --> 02:49:11,870
Okay.

5065
02:49:11,870 --> 02:49:12,570
Let's grab the gun.

5066
02:49:12,950 --> 02:49:13,890
Um, where is it?

5067
02:49:14,030 --> 02:49:14,130
Oh.

5068
02:49:16,750 --> 02:49:17,110
Oh.

5069
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:17,570
Oh, I got it.

5070
02:49:17,970 --> 02:49:18,310
Nice.

5071
02:49:19,370 --> 02:49:19,690
Alright.

5072
02:49:20,390 --> 02:49:20,930
Wait, where's the...

5073
02:49:20,930 --> 02:49:21,650
Where did Nimi go?

5074
02:49:21,870 --> 02:49:22,410
See it right there?

5075
02:49:22,790 --> 02:49:23,630
Yeah, I got it.

5076
02:49:23,690 --> 02:49:24,170
Where's Nimi?

5077
02:49:25,950 --> 02:49:26,610
Maybe we're not close enough.

5078
02:49:26,610 --> 02:49:28,090
Oh my gosh, I have to be close to it.

5079
02:49:29,050 --> 02:49:30,550
Guys, what happened to Nimi, guys?

5080
02:49:31,130 --> 02:49:32,170
New item research.

5081
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:33,870
I think she died.

5082
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:34,570
She's finding something.

5083
02:49:34,570 --> 02:49:35,550
She found a shovel.

5084
02:49:36,750 --> 02:49:38,590
Dig up the items under the...

5085
02:49:38,590 --> 02:49:39,730
How many missions?

5086
02:49:40,790 --> 02:49:40,970
What?

5087
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:47,820
Oh, oh, oh, whoa.

5088
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:55,280
Oh my god.

5089
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:56,180
Oh my god.

5090
02:49:56,320 --> 02:49:56,940
Look what you did.

5091
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:57,900
Look what you did.

5092
02:49:58,120 --> 02:49:58,960
Look what you did.

5093
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:00,000
I'm gonna burst him down.

5094
02:50:00,100 --> 02:50:00,760
I'm not gonna lie.

5095
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:06,220
Oh my god.

5096
02:50:06,380 --> 02:50:06,660
Oh my god.

5097
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,200
Doobie's alive.

5098
02:50:07,360 --> 02:50:07,880
Doobie is alive.

5099
02:50:08,780 --> 02:50:09,400
Doobie's alive.

5100
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:10,880
Doobie's alive.

5101
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:13,060
Doobie?

5102
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:15,360
Doobie?

5103
02:50:15,900 --> 02:50:16,500
Oh, you're alive.

5104
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:17,740
Okay, we can bring Nimi.

5105
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:18,620
I think Nimi died.

5106
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:19,580
No, wait.

5107
02:50:19,660 --> 02:50:20,420
I think Nimi's alive.

5108
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:21,460
Someone said she has the shovel.

5109
02:50:21,460 --> 02:50:21,480
No.

5110
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:23,460
Yeah, but maybe she died with a shovel.

5111
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:24,160
No.

5112
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:24,860
She's alive!

5113
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:25,480
She's alive!

5114
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:26,880
She's alive!

5115
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:27,500
Nimi!

5116
02:50:28,840 --> 02:50:29,720
Nimi alive!

5117
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:30,920
Nimi alive!

5118
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:31,920
We're alive.

5119
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:32,800
We're alive.

5120
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:34,980
We're alive.

5121
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:37,260
I got a shovel.

5122
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:38,040
I got a shovel.

5123
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:38,340
I got a shovel.

5124
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:40,060
I was drinking my drink.

5125
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:40,620
Orange trees.

5126
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:42,660
Orange tree.

5127
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:42,960
Orange tree.

5128
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:43,480
Orange tree right here.

5129
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:43,980
Orange tree.

5130
02:50:45,460 --> 02:50:46,260
Orange tree.

5131
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:48,360
Dig it, dig it.

5132
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:52,160
There's a guy directly in front of us on the right side in the doorway.

5133
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:53,520
How long is this game?

5134
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:54,580
I don't know.

5135
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:56,440
I think we might have to do a part two.

5136
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:57,840
What is that?

5137
02:50:58,160 --> 02:50:59,180
Yellow car?

5138
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:02,180
Where is a yellow car?

5139
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:02,440
Is this yellow?

5140
02:51:02,900 --> 02:51:03,960
Is this yellow?

5141
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:05,460
Is this yellow?

5142
02:51:05,460 --> 02:51:09,720
Why is there... There's like... Ten hundred objectives on our screen.

5143
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:10,380
Oh, Toby!

5144
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:11,300
Get in front of you, Toby!

5145
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:12,080
Toby!

5146
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:17,640
But there's another... Wait, Nimi, there's another trio.

5147
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:18,160
Over here!

5148
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:18,820
Where?

5149
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:19,400
Show me.

5150
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:21,200
Oh, there is!

5151
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:21,760
I see it!

5152
02:51:21,900 --> 02:51:22,120
Is it?

5153
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:23,780
Oh, oh, guys.

5154
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:25,600
Do you see the guy in front of us?

5155
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:27,320
Yeah, I see.

5156
02:51:37,030 --> 02:51:38,410
Where are yellow cars?

5157
02:51:39,670 --> 02:51:41,490
This is a five-hour game?

5158
02:51:41,890 --> 02:51:42,510
Holy moly.

5159
02:51:42,630 --> 02:51:44,770
Okay, we're at the three-hour mark.

5160
02:51:44,910 --> 02:51:45,990
Someone said we're only halfway.

5161
02:51:47,070 --> 02:51:47,890
No way.

5162
02:51:48,550 --> 02:51:49,390
We're halfway.

5163
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:50,070
Wait, there's a tree.

5164
02:51:50,230 --> 02:51:50,970
There's an orange tree.

5165
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:51,730
Orange tree!

5166
02:51:51,730 --> 02:51:52,350
Oh, there's another one.

5167
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:55,990
Yeah, I have something to do in like an hour or so.

5168
02:51:56,910 --> 02:51:57,950
We just parked.

5169
02:51:57,950 --> 02:51:57,950
We just parked!

5170
02:51:58,770 --> 02:51:59,330
OOOOOOOHHHH!!

5171
02:51:59,330 --> 02:52:00,110
OHH!!

5172
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:01,030
OHH!!!

5173
02:52:01,030 --> 02:52:01,570
OHHWH!!!

5174
02:52:01,570 --> 02:52:02,510
MEOW MEOW!

5175
02:52:03,110 --> 02:52:03,670
MEOW!

5176
02:52:04,050 --> 02:52:04,070
MEOW!

5177
02:52:04,070 --> 02:52:04,390
MEOW!

5178
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:05,570
GO, Dooby, GO!

5179
02:52:05,970 --> 02:52:06,830
Oh, never mind.

5180
02:52:08,350 --> 02:52:08,450
Oh.

5181
02:52:09,410 --> 02:52:11,050
No, Dooby!

5182
02:52:18,530 --> 02:52:20,010
Wait, where did Dooby go?

5183
02:52:21,010 --> 02:52:22,070
Dooby is over there.

5184
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:23,330
Dooby found a lever.

5185
02:52:23,450 --> 02:52:23,950
This guy is.

5186
02:52:24,410 --> 02:52:26,090
Oh, this guy's an asshole.

5187
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:27,210
Yeah.

5188
02:52:27,210 --> 02:52:27,350
Yeah.

5189
02:52:29,790 --> 02:52:30,610
Doobie's alive.

5190
02:52:31,370 --> 02:52:32,270
Yeah, Doobie's alive.

5191
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:34,990
Doobie found a lever is what she said.

5192
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:41,010
Like, I thought when we find the moon, we like, finish the game.

5193
02:52:42,930 --> 02:52:43,390
Hi!

5194
02:52:43,930 --> 02:52:44,130
Hi!

5195
02:52:44,130 --> 02:52:44,330
Hi!

5196
02:52:44,810 --> 02:52:45,210
Don't worry.

5197
02:52:45,970 --> 02:52:47,130
He's not chasing you.

5198
02:52:48,530 --> 02:52:49,010
Alright, nice.

5199
02:52:49,170 --> 02:52:49,330
No, he was.

5200
02:52:49,370 --> 02:52:52,050
Alright, we gotta get the shovel back.

5201
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:53,190
We gotta get the shovel back.

5202
02:52:53,750 --> 02:52:54,210
Shovel.

5203
02:52:54,870 --> 02:52:55,590
Shovel time!

5204
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:58,010
Uh, why these guys are aggressive?

5205
02:52:58,830 --> 02:53:01,630
Alright, alright, alright.

5206
02:53:01,630 --> 02:53:02,130
Whoa!

5207
02:53:10,430 --> 02:53:11,970
Come on, Dougie!

5208
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:16,070
You got caught by the worm!

5209
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:18,870
We might have to get the shovel back to the venue.

5210
02:53:19,790 --> 02:53:23,230
Oh, I thought he was safe!

5211
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:26,050
I thought he was safe!

5212
02:53:26,990 --> 02:53:27,610
I thought he was safe!

5213
02:53:30,310 --> 02:53:33,870
I thought he was friendly!

5214
02:53:33,870 --> 02:53:33,970
Yeah!

5215
02:53:34,190 --> 02:53:35,730
I didn't realize!

5216
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:35,830
Yeah!

5217
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:35,830
I didn't realize!

5218
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:39,110
I thought he was friendly!

5219
02:53:39,490 --> 02:53:40,490
Should I get it, Dougie?

5220
02:53:40,610 --> 02:53:42,130
Yeah, let's rest, Dougie.

5221
02:53:42,490 --> 02:53:43,410
Hey, come back!

5222
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:51,610
Guys, I thought he was friendly!

5223
02:53:52,690 --> 02:53:55,490
Why would you think anything in this game is friendly?

5224
02:53:55,790 --> 02:53:55,950
I don't know!

5225
02:53:56,210 --> 02:53:57,770
I just said hi to him!

5226
02:54:01,670 --> 02:54:03,290
I'm gonna go be a hero!

5227
02:54:03,290 --> 02:54:04,490
Oh, you're gonna get their shovel?

5228
02:54:05,390 --> 02:54:06,070
No, I'm gonna

5229
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:10,560
try...

5230
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:11,380
I know!

5231
02:54:11,620 --> 02:54:13,660
I-I unlocked the door there.

5232
02:54:13,880 --> 02:54:14,200
Yeah, yeah.

5233
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:15,920
I'm gonna grab this... Yeah, you can go straight.

5234
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:16,380
There you go.

5235
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:17,500
I'm gonna dig this area.

5236
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:22,300
Wait, did we do this tree already?

5237
02:54:24,060 --> 02:54:25,020
Wait, I got the shovel.

5238
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:26,260
Oh, you did?

5239
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:26,480
Okay.

5240
02:54:27,020 --> 02:54:27,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5241
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:28,220
Wait, wait, wait.

5242
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:28,880
What did Nimi do?

5243
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:33,600
She's gonna go... try and activate the... the... elevator.

5244
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:34,080
Oh!

5245
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:35,100
Yeah, the elevator.

5246
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:36,100
Okay, okay, okay.

5247
02:54:36,100 --> 02:54:38,580
Okay, as soon as we see it, activate it, we know she did it.

5248
02:54:46,250 --> 02:54:46,930
Oh... oh!

5249
02:54:47,910 --> 02:54:48,110
Oh!

5250
02:54:48,110 --> 02:54:49,090
I think they're looking at us?

5251
02:54:50,010 --> 02:54:50,290
Nah.

5252
02:54:52,570 --> 02:54:53,330
I hear them.

5253
02:54:53,490 --> 02:54:54,550
There's a second goo door?

5254
02:54:56,150 --> 02:54:56,550
What?

5255
02:54:57,690 --> 02:54:57,690
Ah!

5256
02:54:57,970 --> 02:54:58,950
There's a save over there!

5257
02:54:59,110 --> 02:54:59,790
There's a save right there!

5258
02:55:00,030 --> 02:55:00,350
Oh!

5259
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:02,410
Save!

5260
02:55:02,550 --> 02:55:02,850
Come here!

5261
02:55:03,030 --> 02:55:03,890
Mid-Mid, come here!

5262
02:55:03,890 --> 02:55:04,170
Oh!

5263
02:55:10,770 --> 02:55:11,590
Oh!

5264
02:55:11,590 --> 02:55:16,590
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, can't go in the elevator, can't go in the elevator.

5265
02:55:19,710 --> 02:55:20,610
We just leave?

5266
02:55:21,910 --> 02:55:22,850
Where did Mint go?

5267
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:26,130
Mint, come over here, Mint, come over here.

5268
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:28,470
Hold on, I'm getting the gun.

5269
02:55:29,730 --> 02:55:30,950
Don't, she's getting it.

5270
02:55:31,410 --> 02:55:31,810
America.

5271
02:55:33,070 --> 02:55:34,090
I have the gun already.

5272
02:55:34,150 --> 02:55:35,430
She has the gun.

5273
02:55:37,990 --> 02:55:39,490
Mint, she has the gun.

5274
02:55:40,010 --> 02:55:40,170
Mint.

5275
02:55:42,010 --> 02:55:43,170
Yeah, we have it!

5276
02:55:43,210 --> 02:55:43,910
Get over here!

5277
02:55:44,090 --> 02:55:45,150
Get your ass over here!

5278
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:51,580
Okay, we got Rizzer.

5279
02:55:51,820 --> 02:55:53,380
I can't think we got Rizzer.

5280
02:55:55,800 --> 02:55:57,540
Oh, wait!

5281
02:55:58,200 --> 02:56:01,120
We have to wait, because she... Oh, no.

5282
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:01,660
Oh, no.

5283
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:02,460
Oh, no.

5284
02:56:08,610 --> 02:56:11,190
Okay, now we can... Oh, okay, now we can do it.

5285
02:56:15,130 --> 02:56:16,330
Oh my god, three seconds.

5286
02:56:18,670 --> 02:56:21,110
Okay, alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

5287
02:56:22,390 --> 02:56:24,070
Everybody, my chat lied to me.

5288
02:56:24,790 --> 02:56:25,770
What did they say?

5289
02:56:26,250 --> 02:56:27,790
They said that you needed a gun.

5290
02:56:28,290 --> 02:56:29,270
Yeah, she has a gun.

5291
02:56:30,050 --> 02:56:31,110
Yeah, I didn't know that.

5292
02:56:34,430 --> 02:56:34,810
Alright.

5293
02:56:35,490 --> 02:56:35,810
Okay.

5294
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:39,550
Oh, Doobie, I think you're muted again.

5295
02:56:41,070 --> 02:56:41,630
Oh, hello.

5296
02:56:41,870 --> 02:56:42,270
Oh, yeah.

5297
02:56:42,570 --> 02:56:43,790
Oh, yeah, we can hear you, we can hear you.

5298
02:56:43,790 --> 02:56:44,450
Yeah, we can hear you.

5299
02:56:44,470 --> 02:56:44,950
There's a bridge!

5300
02:56:45,450 --> 02:56:46,650
Hey, there's a bridge here.

5301
02:56:47,910 --> 02:56:49,570
There's so much panting everywhere.

5302
02:56:49,950 --> 02:56:51,850
I know, all the meow-meows.

5303
02:56:53,310 --> 02:56:54,510
That's what you call them?

5304
02:56:54,710 --> 02:56:56,210
Yeah, they're the meow-meow.

5305
02:56:56,350 --> 02:56:57,390
The meow-meow.

5306
02:56:57,610 --> 02:56:59,170
We're getting to the second floor of Edenx.

5307
02:56:59,550 --> 02:56:59,990
Oh, nice!

5308
02:57:01,430 --> 02:57:05,970
Uh-oh.

5309
02:57:07,550 --> 02:57:09,790
A little body!

5310
02:57:11,950 --> 02:57:12,150
Yay!

5311
02:57:14,410 --> 02:57:14,890
Oh.

5312
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:16,430
Oh.

5313
02:57:16,430 --> 02:57:16,490
Oh.

5314
02:57:18,110 --> 02:57:18,510
Oh.

5315
02:57:21,870 --> 02:57:23,170
It's fine, we're fine, we're fine.

5316
02:57:23,870 --> 02:57:24,490
We're fine!

5317
02:57:25,090 --> 02:57:25,730
Oh, whoa!

5318
02:57:26,710 --> 02:57:27,310
Close this.

5319
02:57:40,060 --> 02:57:40,680
Same point!

5320
02:57:40,880 --> 02:57:42,320
Safe point, same point, same point.

5321
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,040
Oh my God, we're okay!

5322
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:45,220
Okay, we're okay.

5323
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:46,520
No.

5324
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:46,560
Aw.

5325
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:47,920
No, we're not okay!

5326
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:48,840
We're not okay!

5327
02:57:51,640 --> 02:57:53,160
Oh no, it's so weird.

5328
02:57:53,440 --> 02:57:54,800
It's so weird.

5329
02:57:55,560 --> 02:57:57,540
Are they alive?

5330
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:58,660
Are they alive?

5331
02:57:58,780 --> 02:57:59,620
I don't know.

5332
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:01,600
I don't know if they're dead or not.

5333
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:02,980
I can't tell.

5334
02:58:07,540 --> 02:58:09,900
Oh wait, they're alive, they're alive.

5335
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:11,740
We need a fresh corpse.

5336
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:13,160
Wait, wait, is... Is Mint alive?

5337
02:58:14,340 --> 02:58:15,220
No, she died.

5338
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:17,020
Oh, let's get her back, let's get her back.

5339
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:20,360
We can get her back, yeah.

5340
02:58:22,180 --> 02:58:23,380
All right, we'll come back.

5341
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:26,340
I got got by an eyeball, so be careful.

5342
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:29,960
Wait, what about the... Wait, the electrical box is here?

5343
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:33,240
We're supposed to place a fresh astronaut corpse here.

5344
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:34,760
Well, we can do that.

5345
02:58:35,180 --> 02:58:38,440
What if I could get the... It could've been me.

5346
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:41,020
Oh, do we have to die to it?

5347
02:58:41,620 --> 02:58:42,900
No, I don't think so.

5348
02:58:43,100 --> 02:58:44,180
I think we have to find one.

5349
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:46,800
Yeah, I think we got... Eyeball, eyeball, eyeball.

5350
02:58:58,810 --> 02:59:00,930
I got double-teamed.

5351
02:59:01,550 --> 02:59:03,250
I got double-teamed.

5352
02:59:03,910 --> 02:59:05,870
Oh, Nimi!

5353
02:59:06,270 --> 02:59:09,290
There's only... There's only Nimi left!

5354
02:59:09,430 --> 02:59:11,350
There's a lot of pushing puzzles involved.

5355
02:59:11,610 --> 02:59:13,330
I got double-teamed.

5356
02:59:18,290 --> 02:59:21,270
Oh, now it's all up to her.

5357
02:59:22,610 --> 02:59:24,390
Go, Nimi, go!

5358
02:59:28,200 --> 02:59:28,680
Oh!

5359
02:59:31,060 --> 02:59:32,240
That was so close.

5360
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:36,140
Oh my god.

5361
02:59:36,400 --> 02:59:37,800
I don't even know where she is.

5362
02:59:38,380 --> 02:59:38,860
Oh!

5363
02:59:39,060 --> 02:59:39,700
Oh my god!

5364
02:59:39,820 --> 02:59:40,560
Where is she?

5365
02:59:42,560 --> 02:59:44,400
Guys, I don't even know where she is!

5366
02:59:46,240 --> 02:59:47,840
I'm lost for it.

5367
02:59:49,140 --> 02:59:54,560
Have we always had... How do you even use the map?

5368
02:59:59,290 --> 02:59:59,890
Okay.

5369
03:00:02,270 --> 03:00:10,230
Tool, action, menu, tug... There's no map option... Oh!

5370
03:00:10,450 --> 03:00:10,730
Oh!

5371
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:28,700
Oh!

5372
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:29,740
Oh, she did it!

5373
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:30,700
Oh, she did it!

5374
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:31,360
She put a shortcut!

5375
03:00:31,820 --> 03:00:32,340
Nimi, please!

5376
03:00:32,540 --> 03:00:32,740
Save!

5377
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:33,160
Save!

5378
03:00:33,620 --> 03:00:34,300
Oh, save!

5379
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:34,720
Oh, save!

5380
03:00:35,300 --> 03:00:35,780
Oh, save!

5381
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:37,080
Oh, my God, I'm confused!

5382
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:38,160
Yay!

5383
03:00:38,720 --> 03:00:39,940
You were gaming!

5384
03:00:40,900 --> 03:00:43,000
You were gaming so hard!

5385
03:00:43,100 --> 03:00:44,340
Guys, guys, guys, guys, watch out.

5386
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:44,680
Be careful.

5387
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:47,440
Okay.

5388
03:00:47,720 --> 03:00:49,600
Okay, so we gotta figure out the capsule.

5389
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:50,600
I think the capsule comes from us.

5390
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:56,000
Oh, shot?

5391
03:00:56,520 --> 03:00:56,660
No.

5392
03:01:04,180 --> 03:01:10,420
I can't... Oh, my God, I can't... I can't do anything!

5393
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:15,380
I can't... I can't... Thank you!

5394
03:01:15,940 --> 03:01:18,280
Oh, I think Juice... Oh!

5395
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:21,920
Okay.

5396
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:22,860
Oh, disappeared.

5397
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:24,380
Oh.

5398
03:01:25,580 --> 03:01:26,160
Okay.

5399
03:01:27,240 --> 03:01:28,980
Oh, yeah, welcome back.

5400
03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:29,360
Okay.

5401
03:01:30,260 --> 03:01:30,820
Okay.

5402
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:31,000
Okay.

5403
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,640
The other guy was a pain in the ass.

5404
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:33,420
Not gonna lie.

5405
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:35,200
The guy with the sword?

5406
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:36,000
Yeah.

5407
03:01:36,220 --> 03:01:36,360
Yeah.

5408
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:36,880
Yeah.

5409
03:01:38,040 --> 03:01:38,320
Yeah.

5410
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:38,880
Here he comes.

5411
03:02:01,610 --> 03:02:03,850
Why is it always me?

5412
03:02:04,650 --> 03:02:05,210
Why?

5413
03:02:08,010 --> 03:02:08,570
Wow.

5414
03:02:10,110 --> 03:02:11,370
Is that the trick?

5415
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:13,390
Yeah, that's the trick.

5416
03:02:14,090 --> 03:02:16,950
Oh, you... Oh, you... Emote!

5417
03:02:17,250 --> 03:02:17,750
Oh, my God.

5418
03:02:17,970 --> 03:02:18,730
That's a good one.

5419
03:02:20,610 --> 03:02:21,970
Oh, my God.

5420
03:02:22,390 --> 03:02:27,010
Oh, my God.

5421
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:29,850
Oh, my God.

5422
03:02:30,450 --> 03:02:31,750
Oh, my God.

5423
03:02:31,750 --> 03:02:31,810
Oh, my God.

5424
03:02:32,250 --> 03:02:33,190
Oh, my God.

5425
03:02:33,290 --> 03:02:34,750
Oh, my God.

5426
03:02:34,750 --> 03:02:36,210
Oh, my God.

5427
03:02:37,130 --> 03:02:38,110
Oh, my God.

5428
03:02:38,430 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5429
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5430
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5431
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5432
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5433
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5434
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5435
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5436
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5437
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5438
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5439
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5440
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5441
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5442
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5443
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5444
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5445
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,610
Oh, my God.

5446
03:02:38,610 --> 03:02:38,650
Oh, my God.

5447
03:02:38,650 --> 03:02:38,650
Oh, my God.

5448
03:02:38,650 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5449
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5450
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5451
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5452
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5453
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5454
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5455
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,850
Oh, my God.

5456
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:38,890
Oh, my God.

5457
03:02:38,890 --> 03:02:39,230
Oh, my God.

5458
03:02:39,230 --> 03:02:39,570
Oh, my God.

5459
03:02:39,570 --> 03:02:39,970
Oh, my God.

5460
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:41,430
Oh, my God.

5461
03:02:42,550 --> 03:02:43,490
Oh, my God.

5462
03:02:43,830 --> 03:02:44,050
Oh, my God.

5463
03:02:45,430 --> 03:02:45,850
Oh

5464
03:02:48,930 --> 03:02:53,110
Oh my god, this is so much stuff.

5465
03:02:53,330 --> 03:02:55,290
Wait, it's just the same capsule I found before.

5466
03:02:55,450 --> 03:02:55,530
Okay.

5467
03:02:58,090 --> 03:03:00,090
Well, first we need to find a fresh corpse.

5468
03:03:01,130 --> 03:03:02,830
I don't think Doofy does.

5469
03:03:03,010 --> 03:03:04,650
I don't think she does.

5470
03:03:07,630 --> 03:03:09,050
There's two capsules?

5471
03:03:17,930 --> 03:03:22,710
Oh my god, Doofy's famous last words.

5472
03:03:22,910 --> 03:03:24,770
There's two capsules?

5473
03:03:28,430 --> 03:03:31,850
Guys, I think it's the corpse that's like shown in the little hole.

5474
03:03:32,110 --> 03:03:32,710
Yeah, downstairs?

5475
03:03:33,530 --> 03:03:34,690
Yeah, I think so.

5476
03:03:35,390 --> 03:03:36,730
Oh, so we go downstairs?

5477
03:03:37,890 --> 03:03:39,510
There's also other stairs.

5478
03:03:44,110 --> 03:03:44,590
Okay.

5479
03:03:45,010 --> 03:03:46,190
This guy sucks, the sword locked.

5480
03:03:46,410 --> 03:03:47,570
No, it's not.

5481
03:03:48,470 --> 03:03:49,430
It's not locked.

5482
03:03:49,650 --> 03:03:50,550
Wait, is he right here?

5483
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:53,200
That's an old one.

5484
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:53,880
That's an old one.

5485
03:03:54,480 --> 03:03:55,220
Yeah, we're here.

5486
03:03:55,580 --> 03:03:56,160
There it is.

5487
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:57,480
Watch that guy die, remember?

5488
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:01,180
So he's fresh.

5489
03:04:01,700 --> 03:04:02,040
Yeah!

5490
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:02,840
Oh!

5491
03:04:03,840 --> 03:04:05,260
I mean, it was like an apple.

5492
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:06,480
Oh my god.

5493
03:04:06,580 --> 03:04:06,880
He's fresh!

5494
03:04:07,540 --> 03:04:08,020
Wee!

5495
03:04:08,080 --> 03:04:08,300
Yes!

5496
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:09,200
Fresh meat!

5497
03:04:10,100 --> 03:04:10,520
Fresh meat!

5498
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:10,960
Okay, we...

5499
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:11,620
Woo!

5500
03:04:13,180 --> 03:04:13,540
Woo!

5501
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:15,080
Helicopter!

5502
03:04:17,180 --> 03:04:18,260
Wait, I'm turning around.

5503
03:04:18,340 --> 03:04:18,680
Where are we?

5504
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:19,880
It's just a little bit.

5505
03:04:19,940 --> 03:04:20,620
Where's that, right there?

5506
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:25,520
Oh!

5507
03:04:26,800 --> 03:04:28,180
Oh, we just made one.

5508
03:04:28,300 --> 03:04:29,280
We made a new worm.

5509
03:04:29,440 --> 03:04:30,060
Oh, there we go.

5510
03:04:30,060 --> 03:04:30,320
Oh!

5511
03:04:30,320 --> 03:04:30,540
Oh!

5512
03:04:30,540 --> 03:04:31,140
Please!

5513
03:04:36,810 --> 03:04:37,450
Okay.

5514
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:38,610
Let's get a second.

5515
03:04:38,610 --> 03:04:40,290
Your sacrifice is not in there.

5516
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:49,420
Oh my god!

5517
03:04:50,580 --> 03:04:54,740
Oh, it's coming for me, isn't it?

5518
03:04:57,900 --> 03:04:59,360
It goes through doors?

5519
03:04:59,960 --> 03:05:01,240
Oh my god!

5520
03:05:05,430 --> 03:05:06,630
Are you alive?

5521
03:05:06,890 --> 03:05:07,530
Oh,

5522
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:19,340
mint it spawned!

5523
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:19,580
Get out!

5524
03:05:28,900 --> 03:05:31,580
I have to go back and save them!

5525
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:35,540
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

5526
03:05:40,370 --> 03:05:41,910
No, I'm not dead!

5527
03:05:49,080 --> 03:05:50,460
Oh my god, he's on me.

5528
03:05:50,820 --> 03:05:51,700
Oh my god.

5529
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:55,980
Are you dead?!

5530
03:05:55,980 --> 03:06:00,160
Oh, I don't know if she's dead or not.

5531
03:06:00,520 --> 03:06:03,200
I don't know, I said I've let her die so I can impress!

5532
03:06:06,300 --> 03:06:07,940
No, no, no, no.

5533
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:12,100
Are you alive?!

5534
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:15,040
Oh my gosh, she better be fucking dead.

5535
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:15,680
Oh my god!

5536
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:16,980
Let's go, let's go!

5537
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:21,020
Push, push, push, push, push, push!

5538
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:22,280
Push, push, push!

5539
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:23,520
Only Doobie knows where it is!

5540
03:06:24,100 --> 03:06:24,980
Okay, go, go, go!

5541
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:25,380
Okay, I'll leave the way.

5542
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:26,060
This way, this way!

5543
03:06:27,280 --> 03:06:27,600
Okay.

5544
03:06:27,740 --> 03:06:28,540
It's in a corner!

5545
03:06:28,880 --> 03:06:29,580
Okay, we do this!

5546
03:06:29,820 --> 03:06:30,140
There you go!

5547
03:06:31,320 --> 03:06:31,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

5548
03:06:31,960 --> 03:06:32,440
He's upstairs!

5549
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:33,520
He's by the same point!

5550
03:06:33,520 --> 03:06:33,820
Oh, he is!

5551
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:34,380
He's by the same point!

5552
03:06:34,860 --> 03:06:35,600
I'm pushing, I'm pushing!

5553
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:36,800
He's walking over to the left!

5554
03:06:39,100 --> 03:06:39,580
I'm pushing!

5555
03:06:42,020 --> 03:06:43,580
Oh my god, I'm pushing so fast!

5556
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:45,960
Hold on, I gotta check where we're going on.

5557
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:47,400
She's behind!

5558
03:06:47,580 --> 03:06:48,040
He's behind us!

5559
03:06:48,220 --> 03:06:48,520
No!

5560
03:06:52,360 --> 03:06:53,240
It's up there!

5561
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:54,280
He's behind you!

5562
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:55,160
He's behind you!

5563
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:02,620
Oh, no!

5564
03:07:02,960 --> 03:07:03,000
Oh!

5565
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:06,880
He ran into the same point!

5566
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:10,100
One of them is in the same point!

5567
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:16,900
It's okay.

5568
03:07:18,720 --> 03:07:19,660
Oh, no!

5569
03:07:19,860 --> 03:07:21,640
They're both velocity cameras!

5570
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:26,400
I'm almost there!

5571
03:07:26,820 --> 03:07:28,720
I got... I can't try.

5572
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:30,180
Oh, no!

5573
03:07:35,660 --> 03:07:37,540
You're almost there!

5574
03:07:37,780 --> 03:07:39,160
You're almost there!

5575
03:07:46,850 --> 03:07:47,750
You're almost there!

5576
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:50,090
Well, I'll distract the guy, I guess.

5577
03:07:51,760 --> 03:07:52,530
Oh, no!

5578
03:07:52,710 --> 03:07:53,650
She doesn't know!

5579
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:56,110
She doesn't know!

5580
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:58,490
We're all dead!

5581
03:08:03,390 --> 03:08:04,030
Okay.

5582
03:08:06,850 --> 03:08:07,490
Okay.

5583
03:08:07,850 --> 03:08:09,230
We'll find the moon one day.

5584
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:17,200
Oh, Doobie's so smart!

5585
03:08:30,840 --> 03:08:32,120
Your eyeball!

5586
03:08:32,620 --> 03:08:33,460
Oh, no!

5587
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:35,160
Bad time!

5588
03:08:35,620 --> 03:08:37,100
That was such a bad time!

5589
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:38,000
I was such...

5590
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:38,780
Okay, I...

5591
03:08:38,780 --> 03:08:41,180
I was like, Oh, Doobie's so smart!

5592
03:08:41,180 --> 03:08:44,240
And then you got ran over by the eye!

5593
03:08:47,140 --> 03:08:47,720
Oh!

5594
03:08:48,200 --> 03:08:48,660
Pies!

5595
03:08:48,920 --> 03:08:48,920
Pies!

5596
03:08:49,040 --> 03:08:49,140
Pies!

5597
03:08:49,240 --> 03:08:49,280
Pies!

5598
03:08:49,420 --> 03:08:49,420
Pies!

5599
03:08:49,480 --> 03:08:49,480
Pies!

5600
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:50,100
I'll distract him!

5601
03:08:50,480 --> 03:08:50,760
Yeah, yeah!

5602
03:08:50,800 --> 03:08:51,700
Why was distract him?

5603
03:08:52,840 --> 03:08:53,820
Well, we'll distract him!

5604
03:08:55,480 --> 03:08:56,400
I did it!

5605
03:08:56,460 --> 03:08:57,060
I distracted!

5606
03:08:57,460 --> 03:08:58,360
I distracted!

5607
03:08:59,180 --> 03:09:00,600
I did it!

5608
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:02,460
I...

5609
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:02,720
Wait!

5610
03:09:03,160 --> 03:09:04,160
You died, too!

5611
03:09:06,020 --> 03:09:06,980
Oh, no!

5612
03:09:07,940 --> 03:09:09,020
Oh, no!

5613
03:09:14,760 --> 03:09:16,560
Wait, cause the eyeballs have passed!

5614
03:09:16,900 --> 03:09:18,060
Oh my god, it's...

5615
03:09:18,060 --> 03:09:19,420
It's Doobie again!

5616
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,180
It's Doobie again!

5617
03:09:24,220 --> 03:09:25,080
I believe!

5618
03:09:32,250 --> 03:09:33,570
Oh, this is where the other...

5619
03:09:34,670 --> 03:09:35,170
Oh!

5620
03:09:44,730 --> 03:09:46,930
This air is so hard!

5621
03:09:47,250 --> 03:09:48,410
What the fuck?

5622
03:09:51,980 --> 03:09:53,500
Okay, he's still downstairs!

5623
03:09:54,300 --> 03:09:56,160
I feel like there's gotta be a way to tease it!

5624
03:09:56,420 --> 03:09:57,700
Yeah, there has to be!

5625
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:58,480
Oh, he's still downstairs?

5626
03:09:58,480 --> 03:10:01,460
He has to be, because I let him downstairs when we save.

5627
03:10:01,640 --> 03:10:05,140
Maybe, like, one of us just has to bring him downstairs, and then, like, run around.

5628
03:10:05,380 --> 03:10:05,540
Yeah.

5629
03:10:05,860 --> 03:10:08,160
But then how will we know when the other person's, like, dead?

5630
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:09,620
Like, when it's just us left?

5631
03:10:11,340 --> 03:10:12,140
Wait, is he there?

5632
03:10:13,340 --> 03:10:13,700
Alright.

5633
03:10:14,900 --> 03:10:15,580
Where is he?

5634
03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:19,160
He was by the save point!

5635
03:10:20,280 --> 03:10:20,640
Okay.

5636
03:10:24,630 --> 03:10:26,150
Wait, we're by the save point.

5637
03:10:26,410 --> 03:10:27,650
We'll try and lure him.

5638
03:10:32,100 --> 03:10:32,500
We're by the save point.

5639
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:33,660
Oh.

5640
03:10:33,660 --> 03:10:34,640
Put him downstairs!

5641
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:36,120
Oh, he's downstairs?

5642
03:10:36,620 --> 03:10:37,880
No, we're gonna bring him downstairs.

5643
03:10:37,880 --> 03:10:38,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5644
03:10:38,560 --> 03:10:38,920
Okay, yeah, yeah.

5645
03:10:38,980 --> 03:10:39,560
Open the door.

5646
03:10:43,430 --> 03:10:45,530
We're going to bring the man downstairs!

5647
03:10:45,750 --> 03:10:46,830
The scary man!

5648
03:10:47,590 --> 03:10:49,970
Yeah, you guys push the thing and watch for the eyeball.

5649
03:10:50,310 --> 03:10:50,790
Go, go, go.

5650
03:10:54,460 --> 03:10:55,380
Is he coming over?

5651
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:57,820
I hear him.

5652
03:10:57,980 --> 03:10:58,500
Yeah, me too.

5653
03:10:59,400 --> 03:10:59,740
Alright.

5654
03:11:01,280 --> 03:11:02,180
We got this.

5655
03:11:03,340 --> 03:11:04,640
We can literally loop around this.

5656
03:11:04,780 --> 03:11:05,840
No, we can loop around this.

5657
03:11:05,980 --> 03:11:06,920
This garbage can.

5658
03:11:14,180 --> 03:11:15,400
I can loop in here.

5659
03:11:16,820 --> 03:11:18,260
Oh, he's coming for you, Doobie!

5660
03:11:21,620 --> 03:11:22,760
Oh, I'll stay here.

5661
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:26,080
Just in case he fucks up.

5662
03:11:26,180 --> 03:11:27,960
Just in case Doobie dies and comes back.

5663
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:31,220
I think that'll be fine, right?

5664
03:11:32,820 --> 03:11:34,520
It's dead by daylight time.

5665
03:11:34,680 --> 03:11:35,880
We're dbd-ing.

5666
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:40,460
Doobie, are you alive?

5667
03:11:45,260 --> 03:11:46,980
Team Yellow, we're brave.

5668
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:49,440
We're brave people.

5669
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:53,380
I don't know if Doobie's alive.

5670
03:12:01,960 --> 03:12:07,300
I think Doobie… I think… I think Doobie died.

5671
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:08,700
I think Doobie died.

5672
03:12:08,960 --> 03:12:10,340
I actually think she died.

5673
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:13,120
She's dead.

5674
03:12:13,380 --> 03:12:14,460
She has to be dead.

5675
03:12:21,140 --> 03:12:22,520
Oh my God, please don't jump.

5676
03:12:22,900 --> 03:12:23,780
Please don't jump.

5677
03:12:24,140 --> 03:12:24,860
Please don't jump.

5678
03:12:25,400 --> 03:12:29,000
I… Oh my god, they better be doing this.

5679
03:12:29,600 --> 03:12:30,860
Oh my god, they did it.

5680
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:32,060
They did it.

5681
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:32,900
Did you guys do it?

5682
03:12:33,340 --> 03:12:34,380
I guess that's why.

5683
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:35,180
Oh, I did it.

5684
03:12:35,280 --> 03:12:36,100
Okay, I looped him.

5685
03:12:36,220 --> 03:12:37,300
Okay, he's still downstairs.

5686
03:12:37,980 --> 03:12:41,120
Wait, but there's only... there's two more that we need.

5687
03:12:41,380 --> 03:12:42,320
Well, where's the other two?

5688
03:12:43,160 --> 03:12:43,800
I saw one.

5689
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:46,220
He's not downstairs.

5690
03:12:47,360 --> 03:12:48,700
Wait, he's not downstairs anymore?

5691
03:12:49,160 --> 03:12:51,100
No, he just chased after us.

5692
03:12:51,100 --> 03:12:54,280
Oh, there he is.

5693
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:56,960
Where are the other two capsules?

5694
03:13:01,660 --> 03:13:08,300
Oh, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

5695
03:13:09,980 --> 03:13:11,580
Oh my god.

5696
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:13,720
Okay, what's over here?

5697
03:13:14,820 --> 03:13:16,040
Any more capsules?

5698
03:13:16,400 --> 03:13:18,560
Maybe there's a... Oh, it's this area!

5699
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:20,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5700
03:13:20,280 --> 03:13:20,940
It's the third floor!

5701
03:13:21,160 --> 03:13:21,820
It's the third floor!

5702
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:28,240
Maybe there's more capsules downstairs.

5703
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:32,820
Wait, are they alive?

5704
03:13:34,340 --> 03:13:35,060
We can try.

5705
03:13:36,580 --> 03:13:36,960
Oh.

5706
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:38,500
Alright, do you guys know where the...

5707
03:13:38,500 --> 03:13:39,680
There's one on this floor.

5708
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:41,800
There's a door that was unopened.

5709
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:43,660
Okay, so I'll try and lead the other...

5710
03:13:43,660 --> 03:13:46,360
Okay, we'll try and lead them back downstairs again.

5711
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:48,560
Because I know how to lead them.

5712
03:13:50,540 --> 03:13:51,400
Do we see them?

5713
03:13:51,560 --> 03:13:52,360
I'll lead them back down.

5714
03:13:58,810 --> 03:14:00,690
Wait, there is a... There's a capsule downstairs.

5715
03:14:03,090 --> 03:14:03,450
Wait.

5716
03:14:05,050 --> 03:14:06,490
I see a capsule downstairs.

5717
03:14:07,490 --> 03:14:08,370
You see one downstairs?

5718
03:14:08,530 --> 03:14:09,390
Yeah, on the...

5719
03:14:14,530 --> 03:14:15,570
Okay, I'll lead them.

5720
03:14:20,540 --> 03:14:21,400
Oh my god.

5721
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:23,980
I can't loop because I'm being chased by Nimi.

5722
03:14:29,430 --> 03:14:29,870
Okay.

5723
03:14:30,810 --> 03:14:31,250
Okay.

5724
03:14:32,090 --> 03:14:32,690
Oh my god.

5725
03:14:34,070 --> 03:14:35,210
He's taking...

5726
03:14:35,210 --> 03:14:36,750
I was like, I said...

5727
03:14:36,750 --> 03:14:38,390
I was gonna be taking charge.

5728
03:14:39,130 --> 03:14:40,390
What the fuck?

5729
03:14:40,610 --> 03:14:42,950
He charged right at me.

5730
03:14:43,630 --> 03:14:45,010
He jumped up here.

5731
03:14:45,130 --> 03:14:45,430
Fuck.

5732
03:14:45,830 --> 03:14:46,130
Fuck.

5733
03:14:52,250 --> 03:14:53,090
It's okay.

5734
03:14:53,090 --> 03:14:53,910
We saved.

5735
03:14:55,570 --> 03:14:56,190
Where am I?

5736
03:15:09,660 --> 03:15:10,560
Oh no.

5737
03:15:10,700 --> 03:15:11,900
It's all up to Doobie again.

5738
03:15:11,900 --> 03:15:13,560
They've been turned into some kind of giant worm.

5739
03:15:13,640 --> 03:15:14,640
It's now crawling across the floor.

5740
03:15:14,720 --> 03:15:15,080
It's a nightmare.

5741
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:17,560
Get us out of here before it's too late.

5742
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:19,240
If this keeps up, we'll be the next turn to work.

5743
03:15:19,420 --> 03:15:20,160
The moon isn't here.

5744
03:15:20,260 --> 03:15:20,780
Not even close.

5745
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:22,920
Are you seeing Katy Perry right now?

5746
03:15:23,220 --> 03:15:24,640
I'm just paying for anything to stop.

5747
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:28,260
It's more, I guess.

5748
03:15:30,200 --> 03:15:31,540
This is the spawn room.

5749
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:47,220
Oh.

5750
03:15:47,700 --> 03:15:47,780
Oh.

5751
03:15:54,470 --> 03:15:54,850
Fireworks.

5752
03:15:55,030 --> 03:15:55,930
It was apes.

5753
03:16:07,810 --> 03:16:11,190
Maybe we should save this for part two.

5754
03:16:11,310 --> 03:16:12,190
Yeah.

5755
03:16:13,690 --> 03:16:15,770
We'll be back.

5756
03:16:16,290 --> 03:16:17,310
They've just...

5757
03:16:18,250 --> 03:16:19,110
Yes.

5758
03:16:22,110 --> 03:16:24,330
This is like 3-0.

5759
03:16:24,330 --> 03:16:27,150
We've... we've resulted the scene.

5760
03:16:27,290 --> 03:16:28,350
We keep dying, we keep coming back.

5761
03:16:29,310 --> 03:16:31,970
We've cloned ourselves so many times.

5762
03:16:33,570 --> 03:16:34,430
I know.

5763
03:16:35,010 --> 03:16:37,390
We're Mickey 500 at this point.

5764
03:16:37,390 --> 03:16:39,710
Yeah, we're Mickey 500.

5765
03:16:41,370 --> 03:16:43,210
Oh, Divi, you're muted, I think.

5766
03:16:44,250 --> 03:16:45,170
Oh, hello, sorry.

5767
03:16:45,330 --> 03:16:45,730
Hello.

5768
03:16:46,790 --> 03:16:46,970
Hello.

5769
03:16:46,970 --> 03:16:47,290
Hello.

5770
03:16:47,970 --> 03:16:48,210
Hello.

5771
03:16:49,130 --> 03:16:51,210
I'm down to do a part two of this.

5772
03:16:51,370 --> 03:16:53,090
Because we were halfway, apparently.

5773
03:16:53,390 --> 03:16:53,930
We were halfway.

5774
03:16:54,470 --> 03:16:56,270
I want to release the moon.

5775
03:16:56,650 --> 03:16:57,350
We got it.

5776
03:16:57,590 --> 03:16:59,630
Yeah, we got to save the moon.

5777
03:16:59,630 --> 03:17:01,110
We got to save the moon.

5778
03:17:05,610 --> 03:17:09,270
Thank you for joining me in this collab, guys.

5779
03:17:09,630 --> 03:17:10,490
Thank you for playing.

5780
03:17:10,510 --> 03:17:11,430
Thank you.

5781
03:17:11,970 --> 03:17:12,410
Yeah.

5782
03:17:13,670 --> 03:17:13,790
Yeah.

5783
03:17:14,870 --> 03:17:15,830
We'll get him next time.

5784
03:17:15,970 --> 03:17:16,950
We'll get him next time.

5785
03:17:19,610 --> 03:17:21,630
Wait, what was the breakdancing one again?

5786
03:17:22,190 --> 03:17:22,630
Oh, I got it.

5787
03:17:22,730 --> 03:17:23,250
That's three.

5788
03:17:23,470 --> 03:17:23,890
Yeah.

5789
03:17:24,110 --> 03:17:24,550
It's three.

5790
03:17:24,550 --> 03:17:25,330
Yeah.

5791
03:17:28,050 --> 03:17:28,710
Yeah.

5792
03:17:28,850 --> 03:17:29,510
Yeah.

5793
03:17:29,510 --> 03:17:32,250
I hear these sound effects in my dreams.

5794
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:32,930
Boom.

5795
03:17:35,730 --> 03:17:38,310
Oh my God.

5796
03:17:38,450 --> 03:17:40,190
I'm so done with the slam dunk.

5797
03:17:40,690 --> 03:17:42,550
Thank you guys for watching.

5798
03:17:43,010 --> 03:17:43,370
Yeah.

5799
03:17:43,630 --> 03:17:43,670
Yeah.

5800
03:17:44,030 --> 03:17:44,130
Thank you guys.

5801
03:17:44,770 --> 03:17:45,350
Thank you.

5802
03:17:45,490 --> 03:17:45,810
Thank you everyone.

5803
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:48,350
Thank you everyone for joining us.

5804
03:17:49,010 --> 03:17:52,430
I had a great time with green and yellow today.

5805
03:17:52,670 --> 03:17:53,910
Team yellow vs.

5806
03:17:54,110 --> 03:17:54,550
team green.

5807
03:17:58,250 --> 03:17:59,290
That was great.

5808
03:17:59,670 --> 03:18:03,130
Alright, we'll figure out when to play part 2 later.

5809
03:18:03,750 --> 03:18:04,470
Sometime, yeah.

5810
03:18:04,930 --> 03:18:06,010
Yeah, thank you guys.

5811
03:18:06,250 --> 03:18:06,970
Thank you guys.

5812
03:18:07,370 --> 03:18:08,170
Thank you!

5813
03:18:08,790 --> 03:18:11,550
Alright, I'll see you guys later.

5814
03:18:12,010 --> 03:18:13,870
I'm gonna go talk to my chat.

5815
03:18:14,710 --> 03:18:15,210
Yeah, me too.

5816
03:18:15,530 --> 03:18:17,090
Alright, I'll see you guys.

5817
03:18:17,090 --> 03:18:17,990
Bye-bye!

5818
03:18:19,750 --> 03:18:22,370
Bye-bye!

5819
03:18:22,630 --> 03:18:23,330
Bye-bye!

5820
03:18:26,850 --> 03:18:27,710
I'll save it.

5821
03:18:28,730 --> 03:18:29,730
I think it's saved.

5822
03:18:29,870 --> 03:18:31,090
It should be saved when I'm saved.

5823
03:18:34,250 --> 03:18:38,090
He's like, I don't even know what... Yeah, I'll save it.

5824
03:18:38,210 --> 03:18:38,430
Yeah, yeah.

5825
03:18:38,730 --> 03:18:39,610
I'll save it for us.

5826
03:18:39,690 --> 03:18:40,290
Thank you for watching!

5827
03:18:41,050 --> 03:18:41,210
Wait, wait, wait!

5828
03:18:41,530 --> 03:18:42,270
Get over here!

5829
03:18:42,650 --> 03:18:43,310
I need to save this.

5830
03:18:44,170 --> 03:18:44,570
Yeah, don't worry.

5831
03:18:44,650 --> 03:18:45,690
Nimi's just gonna breakdance.

5832
03:18:45,690 --> 03:18:47,370
I hope the host can... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5833
03:18:47,690 --> 03:18:51,950
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it saves because, like, last time when we remade the lobby, it saved.

5834
03:18:53,110 --> 03:18:53,490
Oh!

5835
03:18:53,490 --> 03:18:54,650
Gosh, these sound effects.

5836
03:18:54,930 --> 03:18:57,410
I swear to God, that guy fucking slams up you.

5837
03:18:57,530 --> 03:18:58,870
Alright, I'll see you guys!

5838
03:18:59,350 --> 03:18:59,690
Bye-bye!

5839
03:18:59,690 --> 03:19:00,070
Bye-bye!

5840
03:19:00,990 --> 03:19:01,910
Bye-bye!

5841
03:19:06,700 --> 03:19:07,240
Woo!

5842
03:19:10,280 --> 03:19:12,780
Alright, let me swap real quick.

5843
03:19:13,460 --> 03:19:18,520
Oh my gosh, it's been a while since... since we went to a chatting screen together, guys.

5844
03:19:19,240 --> 03:19:19,700
Woah!

5845
03:19:20,720 --> 03:19:23,940
It's been a while since we're here at the saloon.

5846
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:25,780
But thank you guys!

5847
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:26,420
Wow!

5848
03:19:26,700 --> 03:19:27,660
That was really fun!

5849
03:19:27,900 --> 03:19:29,670
I had a great time with, uh...

5850
03:19:31,540 --> 03:19:32,880
Nimi, Doobie, and Min.

5851
03:19:33,180 --> 03:19:34,700
That was a really fun collab.

5852
03:19:34,880 --> 03:19:38,280
I always get really nervous in these types of collabs because it's like, you know...

5853
03:19:39,140 --> 03:19:39,580
Um...

5854
03:19:39,580 --> 03:19:40,120
Um...

5855
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:40,620
Uh...

5856
03:19:40,620 --> 03:19:41,420
It's, you know...

5857
03:19:41,420 --> 03:19:44,160
I know a lot of people were looking forward to this.

5858
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:45,080
Um...

5859
03:19:45,080 --> 03:19:49,740
Like, this has been a collab that a lot of people wanted to happen for a very long time.

5860
03:19:49,980 --> 03:19:52,940
So, I'm very happy that we were able to...

5861
03:19:52,940 --> 03:19:53,320
Um...

5862
03:19:53,320 --> 03:19:57,100
I was able to organize it for all of us and, um...

5863
03:19:57,100 --> 03:19:59,860
Have our schedules finally fully aligned and everything.

5864
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:00,900
Uh, yeah.

5865
03:20:02,380 --> 03:20:02,820
Um...

5866
03:20:02,820 --> 03:20:04,000
So, yeah, and...

5867
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:04,400
Um...

5868
03:20:04,400 --> 03:20:07,260
I was, you know, always the thing he's worrying about is like...

5869
03:20:07,260 --> 03:20:08,540
Will the game be fun for us?

5870
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:09,080
Uh...

5871
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:10,800
I hope, like, the game be fun for us.

5872
03:20:10,900 --> 03:20:12,000
And also, like...

5873
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:12,580
Um...

5874
03:20:12,580 --> 03:20:14,300
And also, the fact that we...

5875
03:20:14,300 --> 03:20:15,720
I wanted it, uh...

5876
03:20:16,180 --> 03:20:16,420
Um...

5877
03:20:16,420 --> 03:20:17,960
Like, all of us to have fun together.

5878
03:20:18,480 --> 03:20:18,780
Yeah.

5879
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:21,720
And Nimi and Doobie and Min were all super fun together.

5880
03:20:22,100 --> 03:20:23,200
And we...

5881
03:20:23,200 --> 03:20:25,200
There was just lots of moments.

5882
03:20:25,880 --> 03:20:27,680
I hope the volume was okay.

5883
03:20:28,220 --> 03:20:28,680
Um...

5884
03:20:28,680 --> 03:20:29,200
That was what...

5885
03:20:29,200 --> 03:20:30,920
I was worried about the volume, too.

5886
03:20:31,160 --> 03:20:33,300
So, I hope it was okay, guys.

5887
03:20:33,580 --> 03:20:33,820
Um...

5888
03:20:33,820 --> 03:20:35,100
Cause I know, like...

5889
03:20:35,100 --> 03:20:36,440
We couldn't really...

5890
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:39,260
Really, you know, balance it quite well.

5891
03:20:39,500 --> 03:20:40,420
In terms of, like...

5892
03:20:40,420 --> 03:20:42,940
Cause everything was connected to one fucking setting.

5893
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:45,300
For some reason.

5894
03:20:45,820 --> 03:20:46,240
So...

5895
03:20:46,240 --> 03:20:49,380
I hope you guys could hear everybody okay.

5896
03:20:49,620 --> 03:20:51,460
Cause that was like, you know...

5897
03:20:52,280 --> 03:20:52,760
Um...

5898
03:20:52,760 --> 03:20:53,120
Um...

5899
03:20:53,120 --> 03:20:54,220
Yeah, the proximity chat.

5900
03:20:54,320 --> 03:20:54,460
Yeah.

5901
03:20:54,720 --> 03:20:56,280
Nimi was a little quiet.

5902
03:20:56,440 --> 03:20:57,900
I think, like, in the beginning...

5903
03:20:57,900 --> 03:20:58,200
Every...

5904
03:20:58,200 --> 03:20:59,320
Like, she was, like...

5905
03:20:59,320 --> 03:20:59,640
Loud.

5906
03:20:59,640 --> 03:21:00,460
I think, like...

5907
03:21:00,460 --> 03:21:01,760
I think she was, like, just far...

5908
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:02,720
Further away from her mic...

5909
03:21:02,720 --> 03:21:03,180
Later on.

5910
03:21:03,500 --> 03:21:03,780
Yeah.

5911
03:21:04,260 --> 03:21:04,580
Uh...

5912
03:21:04,580 --> 03:21:06,180
So I'm glad you guys could cure them fine.

5913
03:21:06,400 --> 03:21:07,000
Yeah, that's...

5914
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:07,160
Yeah.

5915
03:21:07,640 --> 03:21:08,740
There were so many...

5916
03:21:08,740 --> 03:21:09,620
I swear to god.

5917
03:21:09,800 --> 03:21:10,740
I got the timing...

5918
03:21:12,900 --> 03:21:13,380
Uh...

5919
03:21:22,090 --> 03:21:23,590
I got timed.

5920
03:21:24,130 --> 03:21:25,150
Every time.

5921
03:21:26,170 --> 03:21:26,810
The time.

5922
03:21:26,810 --> 03:21:27,130
Every time.

5923
03:21:27,450 --> 03:21:27,990
Then...

5924
03:21:27,990 --> 03:21:28,830
I get time.

5925
03:21:29,230 --> 03:21:30,010
The timing.

5926
03:21:31,570 --> 03:21:31,890
I...

5927
03:21:32,210 --> 03:21:33,370
I was like...

5928
03:21:33,910 --> 03:21:34,430
Uh...

5929
03:21:34,430 --> 03:21:36,210
And I was like, aw, Doobie is so smart.

5930
03:21:36,430 --> 03:21:37,850
And then she fucking dies.

5931
03:21:39,010 --> 03:21:41,450
I'm just like, I'm sorry, Doobie.

5932
03:21:44,390 --> 03:21:45,730
I cursed her.

5933
03:21:45,870 --> 03:21:49,230
I cursed her and she had to die for my sins.

5934
03:21:50,530 --> 03:21:53,590
But yes, I finally do donation reading time again.

5935
03:21:53,590 --> 03:21:56,610
I can finally do it again after my busy hell month.

5936
03:21:56,950 --> 03:21:58,450
Chikori, thank you for the gifted chip.

5937
03:21:58,570 --> 03:21:59,410
Thank you, thank you.

5938
03:21:59,670 --> 03:22:01,150
Yeah, my jinx.

5939
03:22:02,950 --> 03:22:04,110
I'm a hero!

5940
03:22:04,110 --> 03:22:08,270
And then we're like, Crouch, Devi, Crouch!

5941
03:22:12,550 --> 03:22:13,890
And it's like, Devi!

5942
03:22:14,270 --> 03:22:15,490
Devi, Crouch!

5943
03:22:18,190 --> 03:22:20,210
It was so unfortunate.

5944
03:22:20,810 --> 03:22:22,510
Oh my god, she could have made it.

5945
03:22:25,230 --> 03:22:27,830
But yeah, we'll definitely try and do a part two.

5946
03:22:28,090 --> 03:22:31,090
We'll try to do a part two and we'll try and...

5947
03:22:31,090 --> 03:22:35,750
Please never say I'm safe, judging by the stream I would get instantly hit by the truck.

5948
03:22:36,150 --> 03:22:37,250
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

5949
03:22:37,390 --> 03:22:37,670
Thank you.

5950
03:22:38,950 --> 03:22:39,890
We're halfway.

5951
03:22:40,190 --> 03:22:42,170
We're halfway through this, so...

5952
03:22:42,170 --> 03:22:44,230
We'll try to organize a part two.

5953
03:22:44,850 --> 03:22:48,690
So we can finally save the moon.

5954
03:22:49,430 --> 03:22:49,910
Like...

5955
03:22:49,910 --> 03:22:51,830
Like, were we supposed to...

5956
03:22:51,830 --> 03:22:53,850
Is the electrical board...

5957
03:22:53,850 --> 03:22:54,650
Like...

5958
03:22:54,650 --> 03:22:56,090
Like, part of the...

5959
03:22:56,090 --> 03:22:58,770
Like, I'm like, where the fuck are the electrical boards?

5960
03:22:58,770 --> 03:23:00,410
I'm so confused.

5961
03:23:01,550 --> 03:23:06,450
Do we have to, like, do that building area to get the electrical board, guys?

5962
03:23:06,690 --> 03:23:07,830
Because I'm like...

5963
03:23:07,830 --> 03:23:09,170
Like, we got the moon.

5964
03:23:09,170 --> 03:23:11,650
And then suddenly we're, like, doing something else.

5965
03:23:11,810 --> 03:23:12,270
I lost...

5966
03:23:12,270 --> 03:23:14,890
Yeah, that's where I lost the plot of the game.

5967
03:23:15,390 --> 03:23:17,510
Suddenly we're, like, in a new area.

5968
03:23:17,750 --> 03:23:18,090
Like...

5969
03:23:18,690 --> 03:23:19,810
I'm so confused.

5970
03:23:20,130 --> 03:23:21,890
And then, like, map data gathered.

5971
03:23:22,090 --> 03:23:23,610
And I was like, map data?

5972
03:23:23,610 --> 03:23:25,030
I was like, how...

5973
03:23:25,030 --> 03:23:25,450
How...

5974
03:23:25,450 --> 03:23:26,650
Where did I open the map?

5975
03:23:28,430 --> 03:23:28,790
Um...

5976
03:23:28,790 --> 03:23:29,050
Forward.

5977
03:23:29,230 --> 03:23:29,910
Thank you for the super chat.

5978
03:23:29,990 --> 03:23:30,230
Thank you.

5979
03:23:30,310 --> 03:23:31,390
Thank you for the stream.

5980
03:23:31,550 --> 03:23:33,810
You guys triggered a coffin fit out of me.

5981
03:23:34,010 --> 03:23:34,850
Thank you for the super chat.

5982
03:23:34,950 --> 03:23:35,170
Thank you.

5983
03:23:35,250 --> 03:23:35,750
Thank you.

5984
03:23:35,970 --> 03:23:37,030
Yeah, I'm super happy.

5985
03:23:37,230 --> 03:23:39,910
I was able to finally organize it with all of us.

5986
03:23:40,470 --> 03:23:40,830
And...

5987
03:23:42,950 --> 03:23:43,310
Um...

5988
03:23:43,310 --> 03:23:43,450
Um...

5989
03:23:43,450 --> 03:23:44,110
But that was...

5990
03:23:44,110 --> 03:23:44,770
That was really fun.

5991
03:23:44,830 --> 03:23:45,650
I had a great time.

5992
03:23:45,770 --> 03:23:47,070
I, like, laughed a lot.

5993
03:23:51,850 --> 03:23:53,810
Yeah, I felt like, like, we got to the moon.

5994
03:23:53,810 --> 03:23:55,510
And then, we, like, went backwards.

5995
03:23:55,510 --> 03:23:56,250
In progress.

5996
03:23:56,430 --> 03:23:57,410
I don't know what happened.

5997
03:23:58,430 --> 03:23:58,830
Like...

5998
03:23:58,830 --> 03:23:59,550
Like...

5999
03:23:59,550 --> 03:24:01,090
I felt like...

6000
03:24:01,090 --> 03:24:03,570
Like, I felt like we went backwards.

6001
03:24:03,850 --> 03:24:07,150
It's just, like, we stopped progressing after we found the moon.

6002
03:24:08,210 --> 03:24:08,610
Um...

6003
03:24:08,610 --> 03:24:09,870
Sage, thank you for the super chat.

6004
03:24:10,030 --> 03:24:12,310
Like, after we died to the fucking...

6005
03:24:12,310 --> 03:24:13,010
To the...

6006
03:24:13,010 --> 03:24:15,910
The sword man, like, seven times in a row.

6007
03:24:15,910 --> 03:24:17,310
I was like, guys, I think...

6008
03:24:17,310 --> 03:24:17,690
Let's just...

6009
03:24:17,690 --> 03:24:18,670
Let's just stop here.

6010
03:24:18,890 --> 03:24:19,210
I...

6011
03:24:20,670 --> 03:24:21,170
I...

6012
03:24:21,170 --> 03:24:22,010
Oh, Doobie!

6013
03:24:22,110 --> 03:24:23,150
Thank you for the raid!

6014
03:24:23,430 --> 03:24:23,830
Thank you!

6015
03:24:23,930 --> 03:24:24,730
Thank you!

6016
03:24:25,290 --> 03:24:25,770
Thank you!

6017
03:24:26,090 --> 03:24:28,430
Thank you so much to the raid!

6018
03:24:29,850 --> 03:24:30,350
Um...

6019
03:24:30,350 --> 03:24:32,270
I had a great time, Doobie.

6020
03:24:32,690 --> 03:24:33,270
I hope...

6021
03:24:35,410 --> 03:24:35,910
Welcome!

6022
03:24:36,510 --> 03:24:37,610
Welcome, Dooberts!

6023
03:24:37,970 --> 03:24:38,470
Welcome!

6024
03:24:39,890 --> 03:24:40,390
Um...

6025
03:24:40,390 --> 03:24:41,810
Welcome, little D's.

6026
03:24:42,230 --> 03:24:42,730
Uh...

6027
03:24:42,730 --> 03:24:45,070
I am just doing super chat reunion right now.

6028
03:24:45,070 --> 03:24:45,990
I'm just chilling, really.

6029
03:24:46,710 --> 03:24:46,810
Hahaha!

6030
03:24:47,770 --> 03:24:47,870
Hahaha!

6031
03:24:47,870 --> 03:24:48,150
But...

6032
03:24:48,150 --> 03:24:49,810
Welcome, welcome to the saloon!

6033
03:24:50,690 --> 03:24:51,090
Um...

6034
03:24:51,090 --> 03:24:53,010
I'm just reading my super chats at the moment.

6035
03:24:53,550 --> 03:24:53,910
Uh...

6036
03:24:53,910 --> 03:24:54,630
Captain Bob!

6037
03:24:54,830 --> 03:24:55,710
Thank you for the super chat!

6038
03:24:55,810 --> 03:24:56,510
Thank you, thank you!

6039
03:24:56,570 --> 03:24:57,470
Welcome, little minions!

6040
03:24:57,810 --> 03:24:58,050
Yes!

6041
03:24:58,710 --> 03:24:59,110
Hahaha!

6042
03:25:00,090 --> 03:25:01,550
During the moon adventure!

6043
03:25:02,250 --> 03:25:02,670
The little...

6044
03:25:02,670 --> 03:25:02,990
Haha!

6045
03:25:03,170 --> 03:25:04,430
The little D's are here!

6046
03:25:05,870 --> 03:25:06,270
Um...

6047
03:25:06,270 --> 03:25:06,790
Uh...

6048
03:25:06,790 --> 03:25:07,130
Thurmon!

6049
03:25:07,270 --> 03:25:07,950
Thank you for the super chat!

6050
03:25:08,030 --> 03:25:08,650
Thank you, thank you!

6051
03:25:08,770 --> 03:25:09,590
Nah, nah, nah...

6052
03:25:09,590 --> 03:25:10,050
Oh my gosh!

6053
03:25:10,050 --> 03:25:12,130
I wanna play Moonbase Alpha so badly!

6054
03:25:12,590 --> 03:25:12,990
Um...

6055
03:25:12,990 --> 03:25:17,630
That's, like, one of the games that I've been wanting to play for the longest time.

6056
03:25:17,810 --> 03:25:19,210
What if we just do space games?

6057
03:25:19,370 --> 03:25:19,770
Like...

6058
03:25:19,770 --> 03:25:20,150
Hahaha!

6059
03:25:21,110 --> 03:25:21,910
What if...

6060
03:25:21,910 --> 03:25:25,110
Cause, like, Moonbase Alpha is only fun when there is, like...

6061
03:25:25,110 --> 03:25:26,050
Like, a lot of us.

6062
03:25:26,170 --> 03:25:26,730
Oh my...

6063
03:25:26,730 --> 03:25:27,890
But I don't even know the plot!

6064
03:25:27,890 --> 03:25:30,770
I don't even know, like, what the plot...

6065
03:25:30,770 --> 03:25:32,330
Was for...

6066
03:25:32,330 --> 03:25:32,490
Haha!

6067
03:25:33,270 --> 03:25:33,910
Like, what the...

6068
03:25:33,910 --> 03:25:36,310
The game plot is for Moonbase Alpha.

6069
03:25:36,650 --> 03:25:37,650
Cause, it's like...

6070
03:25:37,650 --> 03:25:39,830
All I know is just, like, the text to...

6071
03:25:39,830 --> 03:25:40,130
Speech.

6072
03:25:40,430 --> 03:25:40,590
Oh!

6073
03:25:40,810 --> 03:25:41,070
Oh!

6074
03:25:41,650 --> 03:25:42,170
Hahaha!

6075
03:25:42,710 --> 03:25:43,590
John Madden!

6076
03:25:43,830 --> 03:25:44,650
The voice mo...

6077
03:25:44,650 --> 03:25:45,470
Yeah, the voice...

6078
03:25:45,470 --> 03:25:47,170
The voices is the plot.

6079
03:25:47,550 --> 03:25:47,670
Yeah!

6080
03:25:49,650 --> 03:25:50,010
Hahaha!

6081
03:25:50,710 --> 03:25:51,070
Hahaha!

6082
03:25:51,950 --> 03:25:52,910
It has...

6083
03:25:52,910 --> 03:25:53,890
It's the face...

6084
03:25:53,890 --> 03:25:55,510
It's the face on the moon!

6085
03:25:55,770 --> 03:25:56,230
Doki!

6086
03:25:56,390 --> 03:25:57,510
Of course that's the plot!

6087
03:25:59,070 --> 03:25:59,430
Um...

6088
03:25:59,430 --> 03:26:00,370
El, thank you for the super chat!

6089
03:26:00,470 --> 03:26:01,290
Thank you!

6090
03:26:01,390 --> 03:26:01,990
El, Doki!

6091
03:26:02,150 --> 03:26:04,670
Don't get the others banned just like you did with Chibi and Doki!

6092
03:26:04,750 --> 03:26:05,490
Thank you for the super chat!

6093
03:26:05,550 --> 03:26:05,750
Thank you!

6094
03:26:05,810 --> 03:26:06,090
Thank you!

6095
03:26:06,230 --> 03:26:06,430
Professor!

6096
03:26:06,590 --> 03:26:07,530
Thank you for the super chat!

6097
03:26:07,590 --> 03:26:07,810
Thank you!

6098
03:26:08,410 --> 03:26:08,990
Oh, yes!

6099
03:26:09,170 --> 03:26:10,190
Next week...

6100
03:26:10,970 --> 03:26:11,330
Um...

6101
03:26:11,330 --> 03:26:15,310
Next week, our collab is gonna be with the Sloppy Sisters.

6102
03:26:15,650 --> 03:26:18,330
So, we're gonna be playing Peak next week.

6103
03:26:18,390 --> 03:26:22,830
I don't know if Laimo or Snuffy has played Peak yet, but Min and I have yet to play Peak.

6104
03:26:23,010 --> 03:26:27,130
I made sure to, like, not play the game yet until my first collab.

6105
03:26:27,890 --> 03:26:28,330
Um...

6106
03:26:28,330 --> 03:26:29,950
So, that's gonna be next Friday.

6107
03:26:30,530 --> 03:26:30,970
Uh...

6108
03:26:30,970 --> 03:26:31,570
But I don't know...

6109
03:26:31,570 --> 03:26:34,230
I know Min hasn't, but I don't know if Snuffy or Laimo has yet.

6110
03:26:34,230 --> 03:26:37,150
So, we're just gonna go with zero...

6111
03:26:56,670 --> 03:26:57,110
Uh...

6112
03:26:57,110 --> 03:26:57,390
In advance.

6113
03:26:57,630 --> 03:27:00,450
And also, with the Sloppy Sisters, we plan that in advance as well.

6114
03:27:01,230 --> 03:27:01,630
Um...

6115
03:27:01,630 --> 03:27:01,970
And...

6116
03:27:01,970 --> 03:27:06,010
I try to make sure to, like, not spoil myself until that collab.

6117
03:27:07,410 --> 03:27:07,810
Um...

6118
03:27:07,810 --> 03:27:08,230
So, yeah.

6119
03:27:08,290 --> 03:27:12,390
Cause I had, like, invitations from other VTubers to join, but I said, I'm sorry!

6120
03:27:12,650 --> 03:27:13,290
I'm sorry!

6121
03:27:13,290 --> 03:27:15,050
I wanna go in blind first.

6122
03:27:15,330 --> 03:27:16,850
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

6123
03:27:17,110 --> 03:27:18,270
And then I can join later!

6124
03:27:18,850 --> 03:27:19,730
Ha ha ha ha!

6125
03:27:20,230 --> 03:27:20,610
Ha ha ha ha!

6126
03:27:21,230 --> 03:27:21,390
Ha ha ha ha!

6127
03:27:21,450 --> 03:27:21,590
Uh...

6128
03:27:21,590 --> 03:27:22,010
Seijin!

6129
03:27:22,070 --> 03:27:24,110
Thank you for the multiple super stickers!

6130
03:27:24,350 --> 03:27:24,590
Thank you!

6131
03:27:24,690 --> 03:27:25,250
Thank you!

6132
03:27:25,770 --> 03:27:26,150
Uh...

6133
03:27:26,150 --> 03:27:26,410
Vyrysan!

6134
03:27:26,530 --> 03:27:27,970
Thank you, thank you!

6135
03:27:28,010 --> 03:27:29,250
Toki out here in BMI!

6136
03:27:31,130 --> 03:27:31,510
Um...

6137
03:27:31,510 --> 03:27:31,750
AK!

6138
03:27:32,030 --> 03:27:32,730
Thank you for the super chat!

6139
03:27:32,830 --> 03:27:33,450
Thank you, thank you!

6140
03:27:33,510 --> 03:27:35,470
Thank you for such a silly collab...

6141
03:27:35,470 --> 03:27:39,210
I don't think Nimi's ever had so many Ebombs dropped on our stream!

6142
03:27:39,510 --> 03:27:41,450
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

6143
03:27:41,690 --> 03:27:43,610
Also, I don't know what our name- our group name is!

6144
03:27:43,690 --> 03:27:44,170
I don't know.

6145
03:27:44,350 --> 03:27:45,410
I don't know what...

6146
03:27:45,410 --> 03:27:45,750
Uh...

6147
03:27:45,750 --> 03:27:50,130
With Nimi, Mint and Adobe- was it Team Yellow Green?

6148
03:27:50,290 --> 03:27:50,770
Ha ha ha!

6149
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:51,490
I don't know!

6150
03:27:51,830 --> 03:27:53,300
We haven't really- really...

6151
03:27:54,450 --> 03:27:54,830
Um...

6152
03:27:54,830 --> 03:27:57,590
No, like, figure out what our group name should be.

6153
03:28:02,140 --> 03:28:03,000
Green and yellow.

6154
03:28:03,180 --> 03:28:04,860
Oh, but that's the space sister.

6155
03:28:08,400 --> 03:28:09,120
Wife swap.

6156
03:28:10,400 --> 03:28:11,360
We'll figure it out.

6157
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:11,980
We'll figure it out.

6158
03:28:12,060 --> 03:28:14,500
Maybe in part two, we'll figure out what our name will be.

6159
03:28:18,340 --> 03:28:19,600
Luca, thank you for the super chat.

6160
03:28:19,720 --> 03:28:20,420
Thank you, thank you.

6161
03:28:20,600 --> 03:28:21,700
Crank that soldier boy.

6162
03:28:22,180 --> 03:28:23,360
Matt, thank you for the super chat.

6163
03:28:23,460 --> 03:28:24,260
Thank you, thank you.

6164
03:28:24,360 --> 03:28:26,000
Grab that lever, Kronk.

6165
03:28:26,580 --> 03:28:28,080
Uh, Icy, thank you for the super chat.

6166
03:28:28,160 --> 03:28:28,880
Thank you, thank you.

6167
03:28:29,120 --> 03:28:30,560
Hello, Doki, it's my birthday today.

6168
03:28:30,680 --> 03:28:33,220
I had a great time watching your birthday concert at AX.

6169
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:34,840
Did you get a free slushie at 7-0?

6170
03:28:34,940 --> 03:28:35,820
Oh, is it today's 7-0?

6171
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:36,200
Ah!

6172
03:28:36,400 --> 03:28:37,360
No, I didn't.

6173
03:28:37,540 --> 03:28:39,140
I didn't get my free slushie.

6174
03:28:39,360 --> 03:28:40,680
Thank you for the super chat, Icy.

6175
03:28:40,780 --> 03:28:41,740
Thank you, thank you.

6176
03:28:42,900 --> 03:28:44,540
Happy birthday to you.

6177
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:46,680
Happy birthday to you.

6178
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:49,120
Happy birthday, dear Icy.

6179
03:28:49,700 --> 03:28:51,180
Happy birthday to you.

6180
03:28:51,280 --> 03:28:52,160
Yeah, happy birthday!

6181
03:28:52,480 --> 03:28:54,020
Oh my gosh, I forgot to show you guys.

6182
03:28:54,420 --> 03:28:55,480
Just remembered.

6183
03:28:55,480 --> 03:28:57,660
Guys, you guys didn't know my birthday merch dropped.

6184
03:28:58,300 --> 03:28:58,800
Yeah!

6185
03:28:59,540 --> 03:29:05,160
Oh my gosh, I... I was like, what's my image for this?

6186
03:29:05,240 --> 03:29:08,380
And it was live action Jumba and Plinkly.

6187
03:29:10,460 --> 03:29:12,880
Okay, let me replace that real quick.

6188
03:29:13,220 --> 03:29:17,160
Guys, let me... Whoa, that angie.

6189
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:18,540
Let me see.

6190
03:29:18,760 --> 03:29:20,600
Where's my birthday merch?

6191
03:29:21,760 --> 03:29:23,160
Oh my gosh, where is it?

6192
03:29:23,160 --> 03:29:25,900
Where did I save the birthday merch from now?

6193
03:29:26,360 --> 03:29:27,120
Where is it?

6194
03:29:27,320 --> 03:29:27,960
They're not saving?

6195
03:29:28,120 --> 03:29:30,480
Oh wait, I saved it in my birthday folder.

6196
03:29:31,420 --> 03:29:32,260
Is it here?

6197
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:34,000
Oh, here you go.

6198
03:29:34,640 --> 03:29:34,800
Yeah!

6199
03:29:35,260 --> 03:29:36,880
Okay, so... Oh my gosh, it's a giant image.

6200
03:29:37,460 --> 03:29:39,200
Pinned in my chat right now.

6201
03:29:39,320 --> 03:29:40,240
It's Doki Merch.

6202
03:29:40,380 --> 03:29:44,020
It's basically DokiMerch.com.

6203
03:29:44,160 --> 03:29:51,460
And you can get my... There's a lot of items there, but there's... You can buy my birthday bundle right now or any of the birthday merch individually.

6204
03:29:51,460 --> 03:29:52,220
But yes.

6205
03:29:53,160 --> 03:29:55,640
You can, you know, support me and build your shrine.

6206
03:29:56,260 --> 03:30:00,060
Um... I love... I'm so happy that the merch store is out now.

6207
03:30:00,400 --> 03:30:04,100
Um... And we have so many items... Uh... In works there.

6208
03:30:04,320 --> 03:30:08,300
And plan... Um... Planned... Um... In the future.

6209
03:30:08,580 --> 03:30:09,100
So yeah!

6210
03:30:09,620 --> 03:30:10,400
Buy my merch.

6211
03:30:10,780 --> 03:30:11,600
Ha ha ha ha.

6212
03:30:12,280 --> 03:30:13,900
Um... Seijian, thank you for the super chat.

6213
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:14,580
Thank you, thank you.

6214
03:30:14,580 --> 03:30:15,660
He is friendly.

6215
03:30:16,540 --> 03:30:18,760
Uh... Actual, thank you for the magenta soup.

6216
03:30:18,940 --> 03:30:19,740
But thank you, thank you.

6217
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:21,660
Don't disrespect the little...

6218
03:30:22,820 --> 03:30:24,940
Thank you for the magenta soup.

6219
03:30:25,420 --> 03:30:26,360
Thank you, thank you.

6220
03:30:26,520 --> 03:30:27,680
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

6221
03:30:27,820 --> 03:30:28,680
Thank you, thank you.

6222
03:30:29,280 --> 03:30:29,800
Uh... Fuda.

6223
03:30:30,240 --> 03:30:31,220
Thank you for the super chat.

6224
03:30:31,300 --> 03:30:31,960
Thank you, thank you.

6225
03:30:32,360 --> 03:30:34,380
Doki, you're killing me with laughter watching this stream.

6226
03:30:34,520 --> 03:30:35,580
Everyone is hilarious.

6227
03:30:35,920 --> 03:30:36,520
Thank you for the super chat.

6228
03:30:36,600 --> 03:30:37,160
Thank you, thank you.

6229
03:30:37,300 --> 03:30:40,620
I think it's because, like, we all also are, like, very experienced streamers.

6230
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:44,320
And, you know, we all have, like, our own, like, strengths.

6231
03:30:44,320 --> 03:30:46,500
and amazing community in our own right.

6232
03:30:46,680 --> 03:30:48,400
So, like, we combine all our powers together.

6233
03:30:50,300 --> 03:30:50,780
Uh...

6234
03:30:52,260 --> 03:30:56,780
We combine all our powers together to... as a group.

6235
03:30:58,120 --> 03:30:59,080
Uh... Um...

6236
03:30:59,080 --> 03:31:00,840
Because I like... I think, like, um...

6237
03:31:00,840 --> 03:31:06,320
The more experience you have, the more easier it is to do, like, back and forth with people.

6238
03:31:06,900 --> 03:31:08,160
Um... and other VTubers.

6239
03:31:08,420 --> 03:31:10,320
Because, like, you know...

6240
03:31:10,320 --> 03:31:12,800
Like, it's all about building your improv skills.

6241
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:17,340
Um... Alan, Neppers, Manya, War, and JL.

6242
03:31:17,460 --> 03:31:18,460
Thank you for the super chat.

6243
03:31:18,580 --> 03:31:19,540
Thank you, thank you.

6244
03:31:20,680 --> 03:31:22,540
Uh... Luca, thank you for the super chat.

6245
03:31:22,680 --> 03:31:23,560
Thank you, thank you.

6246
03:31:24,100 --> 03:31:25,980
I don't... I think we're safe, the narrator.

6247
03:31:26,240 --> 03:31:27,780
They were, in fact, not safe.

6248
03:31:28,080 --> 03:31:29,040
Thank you for the super chat.

6249
03:31:29,160 --> 03:31:29,940
Thank you, thank you.

6250
03:31:30,280 --> 03:31:32,100
Seijian, thank you again for another super sticker.

6251
03:31:32,320 --> 03:31:33,220
Thank you, thank you.

6252
03:31:34,800 --> 03:31:35,180
Um...

6253
03:31:35,180 --> 03:31:36,660
Uh... Ayoko, thank you for the super chat.

6254
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:37,520
Thank you, thank you.

6255
03:31:37,880 --> 03:31:42,500
Doki, I think Doobie's curse of dying a lot has been passed down to you now!

6256
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:48,100
No, Doobie... Doobie got like... She had such bad luck.

6257
03:31:48,180 --> 03:31:48,820
Oh my god.

6258
03:31:49,500 --> 03:31:56,660
She would either be the last person to live or the first person to die.

6259
03:31:56,840 --> 03:31:57,900
It's one or the other.

6260
03:31:58,360 --> 03:32:01,940
And then I, at the beginning, I was the last person to live.

6261
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:04,540
And then later on, like, I just kept dying first.

6262
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:07,500
Like, every time... All the monsters were just fucking aggro to me.

6263
03:32:07,560 --> 03:32:08,840
I don't know why.

6264
03:32:09,240 --> 03:32:09,680
I...

6265
03:32:09,680 --> 03:32:14,680
It is like... For some reason... Everyone just was like, fuck her in particular.

6266
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:17,040
Like, I get friends.

6267
03:32:17,260 --> 03:32:24,680
And then the guy... And then two of my teammates... Mint and Nimi... Were emoting in front of him.

6268
03:32:24,840 --> 03:32:26,720
I was by the door.

6269
03:32:26,960 --> 03:32:30,180
And then the guy kills me first.

6270
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:32,400
Like, I was like... What?

6271
03:32:32,720 --> 03:32:33,960
I was like... What?

6272
03:32:34,300 --> 03:32:36,020
You guys were closer.

6273
03:32:36,880 --> 03:32:37,560
Like...

6274
03:32:39,200 --> 03:32:47,260
I was like... And then I fucking just see... Like... Nimi and Mint just fucking dancing... In front of him.

6275
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:50,440
Strike.

6276
03:32:50,580 --> 03:32:51,420
Thank you for the super chat.

6277
03:32:51,500 --> 03:32:51,700
Thank you.

6278
03:32:51,820 --> 03:32:52,180
Thank you.

6279
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:54,180
Don't keep by daylight looping, though.

6280
03:32:54,480 --> 03:32:55,240
Thank you for the super chat.

6281
03:32:55,340 --> 03:32:55,540
Thank you.

6282
03:32:55,620 --> 03:32:55,800
Thank you.

6283
03:32:55,920 --> 03:32:56,520
Dad... Oh yeah.

6284
03:32:56,640 --> 03:32:58,400
But dad's working because he wants to walk you soon.

6285
03:32:58,740 --> 03:33:02,480
But I'll walk him after... After the super chat reading.

6286
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:04,060
I only have a few super chats left.

6287
03:33:04,060 --> 03:33:08,060
Um... Uh...

03:33:54,380 --> 03:33:56,940
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6293
03:33:57,500 --> 03:33:59,640
Uh, Maddie, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

6294
03:33:59,900 --> 03:34:04,880
Green and yellow women, or gay women for short.

6295
03:34:05,300 --> 03:34:06,480
Quoted from...

6296
03:34:07,020 --> 03:34:09,960
No, no, no, no.

6297
03:34:10,640 --> 03:34:12,960
I'm almost done, I'm almost done.

6298
03:34:13,300 --> 03:34:13,520
What?

6299
03:34:25,020 --> 03:34:29,380
I don't know why, but he stopped barking when I, like, scold him like an Asian mom.

6300
03:34:31,600 --> 03:34:39,220
He's like, every time, every time I scold him like an Asian mom, he just, like, walks away.

6301
03:34:40,380 --> 03:34:41,460
It works.

6302
03:34:41,660 --> 03:34:43,280
It works every time.

6303
03:34:49,660 --> 03:34:51,260
L, thank you for the super chat.

6304
03:34:51,440 --> 03:34:52,520
Thank you, thank you.

6305
03:34:52,940 --> 03:34:54,240
Green and yellow woman.

6306
03:34:54,400 --> 03:34:55,460
It's okay, woman.

6307
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:57,100
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

6308
03:34:57,180 --> 03:34:57,760
Thank you, thank you.

6309
03:34:57,840 --> 03:34:59,300
I like green and yellow woman.

6310
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:02,560
Strike, thank you for the super chat.

6311
03:35:02,700 --> 03:35:03,320
Thank you, thank you.

6312
03:35:03,780 --> 03:35:07,180
Mintcord is pushing for green and yellow, aka gay.

6313
03:35:07,180 --> 03:35:07,360
Okay.

6314
03:35:09,220 --> 03:35:11,540
Luca, thank you for the magenta soup.

6315
03:35:11,700 --> 03:35:12,500
Thank you.

6316
03:35:12,620 --> 03:35:13,700
What the fuck?

6317
03:35:13,940 --> 03:35:15,080
Dad is bilingual?

6318
03:35:16,260 --> 03:35:22,640
Even the dog is smarter than you because he's bilingual.

6319
03:35:23,740 --> 03:35:25,440
Thank you for the magenta soup.

6320
03:35:25,600 --> 03:35:27,460
Your dog speaks Chinese?

6321
03:35:30,360 --> 03:35:32,840
It's because he grew up with me and my parents.

6322
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:35,360
My parents would speak Chinese to him.

6323
03:35:35,460 --> 03:35:37,000
And then I'd speak Chinese.

6324
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:42,000
And then like... and he knows he's been our bad boy when I pulled out the Cantonese.

6325
03:35:42,580 --> 03:35:42,720
Yeah.

6326
03:35:43,160 --> 03:35:44,500
Chikori, did you give us a super chat?

6327
03:35:44,600 --> 03:35:44,800
Thank you.

6328
03:35:44,920 --> 03:35:45,280
Thank you.

6329
03:35:45,400 --> 03:35:48,440
If English doesn't work, do it again with Cantonese.

6330
03:35:48,720 --> 03:35:51,220
English just isn't threatening enough, guys.

6331
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:54,160
The English language is not threatening enough, guys.

6332
03:35:54,300 --> 03:36:01,500
When an Asian... okay, you know you're in big trouble when they pull out the Cantonese or Chinese.

6333
03:36:01,500 --> 03:36:07,980
Because Cantonese, you can say something like really mundane, but it sounds like... it sounds like I'm yelling at you.

6334
03:36:08,200 --> 03:36:16,080
Like, I can make it sound like I'm yelling at you in Cantonese because we can make it sound super harsh even though it's like something like, you know, super mundane.

6335
03:36:19,860 --> 03:36:21,100
Yeah, it's the tone.

6336
03:36:21,580 --> 03:36:21,760
Yeah.

6337
03:36:23,480 --> 03:36:25,660
Example, I'll be like...

6338
03:36:27,860 --> 03:36:28,220
Uh...

6339
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:29,140
Let's see.

6340
03:36:29,220 --> 03:36:30,240
I'm trying to think of something I can say.

6341
03:36:39,440 --> 03:36:42,060
That sounded like... really mean.

6342
03:36:43,280 --> 03:36:45,660
But, uh... what I said was...

6343
03:36:45,660 --> 03:36:47,280
Hey, did you know today you did really good?

6344
03:36:48,980 --> 03:36:49,420
Yeah!

6345
03:36:53,560 --> 03:36:56,080
And I literally said... did you know today?

6346
03:36:56,260 --> 03:36:57,980
I was like, hey, today you did really good.

6347
03:36:57,980 --> 03:37:00,740
But I said, like, it just sounded super harsh.

6348
03:37:01,240 --> 03:37:01,360
Yeah.

6349
03:37:03,080 --> 03:37:04,780
What did you say to me?

6350
03:37:06,320 --> 03:37:06,820
Oh...

6351
03:37:09,440 --> 03:37:15,120
Yeah, it sounded like I scolded you, but I told... like, in Cantonese, you can make it sound, like, super harsh.

6352
03:37:16,280 --> 03:37:16,780
Um...

6353
03:37:16,780 --> 03:37:18,340
Yeah, it's an aggressive compliment.

6354
03:37:19,860 --> 03:37:20,860
I'm sorry!

6355
03:37:26,520 --> 03:37:27,020
Um...

6356
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:27,820
Let's see.

6357
03:37:30,940 --> 03:37:31,220
Um...

6358
03:37:31,220 --> 03:37:32,520
Hey, guys, thank you again for the super chat.

6359
03:37:32,600 --> 03:37:33,140
Thank you, thank you.

6360
03:37:33,200 --> 03:37:33,780
Oh, I read that already.

6361
03:37:34,120 --> 03:37:35,220
Smug, thank you for the super chat.

6362
03:37:35,340 --> 03:37:36,100
Thank you, thank you.

6363
03:37:36,300 --> 03:37:37,880
Professor, thank you for the super chat.

6364
03:37:38,020 --> 03:37:38,820
Thank you, thank you.

6365
03:37:39,080 --> 03:37:41,820
Okay, I think those were all the super chats for today.

6366
03:37:41,940 --> 03:37:43,280
But I had a great time, everyone.

6367
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:44,700
Oh, I'll give you guys a dad update.

6368
03:37:45,980 --> 03:37:46,260
Uh...

6369
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:47,080
I...

6370
03:37:47,080 --> 03:37:47,520
Uh...

6371
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:48,720
But today...

6372
03:37:48,720 --> 03:37:49,420
Okay, what is it today?

6373
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:51,100
Oh my god, dad's been...

6374
03:37:51,420 --> 03:37:53,140
Been a very bad boy lately.

6375
03:37:53,420 --> 03:37:53,840
I don't know why.

6376
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:56,040
He's been, like, super aggressive towards other dogs lately.

6377
03:37:56,340 --> 03:38:00,800
So, like, I've been, like, bringing treats down just to, like, try to make him, like, more calm.

6378
03:38:00,800 --> 03:38:06,240
But, like, the last two days, for some reason, he's, like, really, really aggressive for some reason.

6379
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:10,900
So, I've been, like, carrying him to the dog park because I didn't want him to, like, try and trigger anything.

6380
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:13,380
Right, saying with Super Chat, thank you, thank you.

6381
03:38:13,480 --> 03:38:15,120
So, I hope it's just a phase for him.

6382
03:38:15,500 --> 03:38:15,920
I don't know.

6383
03:38:16,060 --> 03:38:17,800
Maybe he's, like, extra moody or something.

6384
03:38:18,520 --> 03:38:21,120
Captain, he's golden voice pack for us.

6385
03:38:21,220 --> 03:38:22,520
Thank you for the Super Chat.

6386
03:38:22,660 --> 03:38:23,640
Thank you, thank you.

6387
03:38:23,840 --> 03:38:25,220
Uh, maybe in the future.

6388
03:38:25,600 --> 03:38:25,780
Maybe.

6389
03:38:26,300 --> 03:38:27,420
But, thank you for the super chat.

6390
03:38:27,500 --> 03:38:27,720
Thank you.

6391
03:38:27,900 --> 03:38:28,440
Thank you.

6392
03:38:28,700 --> 03:38:32,060
Hey, Doki, I've also been a bad dragoon!

6393
03:38:32,240 --> 03:38:35,160
Can you call me a moron and can't send me?

6394
03:38:35,420 --> 03:38:37,020
Thank you for the super chat.

6395
03:38:37,180 --> 03:38:38,100
Thank you, thank you.

6396
03:38:38,320 --> 03:38:39,300
I'll think about it.

6397
03:38:39,480 --> 03:38:42,060
I'll think about it.

6398
03:38:42,360 --> 03:38:44,800
Okay, um, but...

6399
03:38:44,800 --> 03:38:46,300
Oh, okay, wait, I wrote this down.

6400
03:38:46,920 --> 03:38:50,520
Um, okay, so, like, yesterday, um...

6401
03:38:50,520 --> 03:38:52,160
He had an incident yesterday.

6402
03:38:52,640 --> 03:38:57,220
um, he tried, for some reason, cause like, usually he'll ignore the dogs.

6403
03:38:57,480 --> 03:39:00,100
And just like, um... um, play with me.

6404
03:39:00,540 --> 03:39:02,080
Um, cause I'd bring his ball down.

6405
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:06,560
But really yesterday, he like, he...

6406
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:10,800
there- there were a lot, I think he got like, overloaded, with like...

6407
03:39:10,800 --> 03:39:14,260
Cause there were so many dogs at the dog park yesterday- yesterday night.

6408
03:39:14,640 --> 03:39:16,960
And I think he got like super overloaded.

6409
03:39:17,540 --> 03:39:21,260
Because um, there're too many dogs at the dog park And they were all, like, running around.

6410
03:39:21,380 --> 03:39:22,240
And he feels, like, threatened.

6411
03:39:22,680 --> 03:39:25,080
And then, so, like, I was playing fetch with Dad.

6412
03:39:25,460 --> 03:39:29,260
And then there was a bunch of dogs near him were, like, running around.

6413
03:39:29,320 --> 03:39:30,540
And he didn't like that.

6414
03:39:30,560 --> 03:39:32,460
And he got, like, super over-simulated.

6415
03:39:32,840 --> 03:39:38,300
And, like, he, like, ran up to, like, one of the big dogs... the big dog there?

6416
03:39:38,520 --> 03:39:42,020
Because the big dog was, like, playing with, like, some small dog... like, medium and small dogs.

6417
03:39:42,180 --> 03:39:45,080
And was, like, um, like, you know, running around.

6418
03:39:45,240 --> 03:39:48,280
And he doesn't like it when dogs run around too much near him.

6419
03:39:48,280 --> 03:39:53,940
So he, like, ran up to the big dog, I guess, to establish dominance and started, like, barking at them.

6420
03:39:54,020 --> 03:40:00,260
Because usually, like, his experience at the dog part, when he barks at them, they, like, back off.

6421
03:40:00,600 --> 03:40:04,560
But this time, like, this big dog was, like, not having it.

6422
03:40:04,700 --> 03:40:06,560
He was like, oh, you're gonna bark at me?

6423
03:40:06,700 --> 03:40:08,100
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

6424
03:40:08,340 --> 03:40:11,280
And then, like, he started, like, barking back at dad.

6425
03:40:11,560 --> 03:40:15,620
And he was like, he was like, and he, like, started chasing dad.

6426
03:40:15,620 --> 03:40:18,560
Like, he was, like, you know, almost wanting to nip him.

6427
03:40:18,780 --> 03:40:22,020
And then dad freaked out because he didn't think he was gonna get challenged.

6428
03:40:22,020 --> 03:40:23,960
Because, like, he hasn't been challenged like that.

6429
03:40:24,120 --> 03:40:28,560
And he was, like, he was yelping and, like, ran into my arms.

6430
03:40:28,580 --> 03:40:30,840
And was like, pick me up, mom, I'm gonna go home.

6431
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:35,540
Yeah, he fucked around and found out.

6432
03:40:35,900 --> 03:40:36,040
Yeah.

6433
03:40:37,660 --> 03:40:40,100
He was like, we can bark back?

6434
03:40:43,220 --> 03:40:50,540
So, at the moment that the big dog started chasing him, like, dad was, like, I, like, because, like, I knew he was trying to fight.

6435
03:40:50,620 --> 03:40:51,780
Like, I knew he was trying to get in a fight.

6436
03:40:51,840 --> 03:40:53,700
So, I instantly got up and, like, went up to him.

6437
03:40:53,980 --> 03:40:55,580
But, like, but then, obviously, that's too late.

6438
03:40:56,240 --> 03:40:59,660
And then, like, dad, like, quickly, like, you know, his tail underneath.

6439
03:40:59,980 --> 03:41:03,020
And, like, ran over to my arms because I bent down.

6440
03:41:03,220 --> 03:41:04,300
And he ran over to my arms.

6441
03:41:04,340 --> 03:41:05,680
And he was like, pick me up, pick me up.

6442
03:41:05,740 --> 03:41:07,460
And then, like, he was like, I want to go home.

6443
03:41:10,360 --> 03:41:14,520
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

6444
03:41:14,880 --> 03:41:19,360
It's like, they can do that, they can bark off back.

6445
03:41:23,540 --> 03:41:24,820
That's illegal.

6446
03:41:25,280 --> 03:41:26,260
I know, right?

6447
03:41:26,680 --> 03:41:29,460
Like, none of the other big dogs ever punished him.

6448
03:41:29,600 --> 03:41:35,960
But this is like the first time a big dog was like, bro, you picked the wrong fight today.

6449
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:44,980
Um, uh, Noriko.

6450
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:45,900
Thank you for the super chat.

6451
03:41:46,020 --> 03:41:46,660
Thank you, thank you.

6452
03:41:46,740 --> 03:41:49,240
I second that Doki Kanto's scolding voice pack.

6453
03:41:49,380 --> 03:41:51,020
This is my advanced deposit.

6454
03:41:51,240 --> 03:41:52,460
Thank you for the super chat.

6455
03:41:52,580 --> 03:41:53,620
Thank you, thank you.

6456
03:41:54,080 --> 03:41:56,660
Um, uh, Slime.

6457
03:41:56,780 --> 03:41:57,520
Thank you for the super chat.

6458
03:41:57,620 --> 03:41:58,200
Thank you, thank you.

6459
03:41:58,280 --> 03:42:00,140
I won't pay for such a pack.

6460
03:42:00,880 --> 03:42:02,320
Thank you for the super chat.

6461
03:42:02,440 --> 03:42:03,360
Thank you, thank you.

6462
03:42:10,900 --> 03:42:11,700
Hello, Toki.

6463
03:42:11,840 --> 03:42:15,120
Every time you speak Cantonese to dad, it's very familiar.

6464
03:42:15,800 --> 03:42:18,760
It's like parents I see on the street in Hong Kong.

6465
03:42:20,760 --> 03:42:23,320
Luca, he should have barked in Cantonese.

6466
03:42:23,500 --> 03:42:24,260
Thank you for the super chat.

6467
03:42:24,380 --> 03:42:24,620
Thank you.

6468
03:42:25,460 --> 03:42:26,160
Alright, guys.

6469
03:42:26,380 --> 03:42:27,580
I'm gonna call it here now.

6470
03:42:27,940 --> 03:42:29,060
Thank you all for coming.

6471
03:42:29,320 --> 03:42:31,340
I had a great time today on stream.

6472
03:42:31,340 --> 03:42:33,940
I had a great time with Mimi, Doobie, and Mint.

6473
03:42:34,320 --> 03:42:38,520
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get them around, get that blood flowing.

6474
03:42:38,640 --> 03:42:42,080
And if you, stay up for me, head to bed, cuz you deserve it.

6475
03:42:43,120 --> 03:42:44,460
Tomorrow, we're gonna try and finish Halo.

6476
03:42:44,560 --> 03:42:46,420
I'm definitely gonna try and finish Halo tomorrow.

6477
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:48,400
I'm gonna do a long intern stream until Halo is done.

6478
03:42:48,740 --> 03:42:50,160
So that's tomorrow's plan.

6479
03:42:50,960 --> 03:42:52,080
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

6480
03:42:52,180 --> 03:42:52,800
Thank you, thank you.

6481
03:42:52,980 --> 03:42:54,420
I used to have a German Shepherd once.

6482
03:42:54,660 --> 03:42:56,440
When walking, a loose poodle came barking.

6483
03:42:56,720 --> 03:43:00,340
My dog grabbed him, swung him around, and threw him.

6484
03:43:00,340 --> 03:43:02,780
The poodle never came back.

6485
03:43:03,100 --> 03:43:06,740
The little dude didn't understand size.

6486
03:43:07,160 --> 03:43:08,160
Holy shit.

6487
03:43:08,560 --> 03:43:11,100
Yeah, that's why I'm scared of what happened with Dad.

6488
03:43:11,340 --> 03:43:13,460
I'm not scared that that would happen to him.

6489
03:43:13,740 --> 03:43:14,920
And then you have the super chat.

6490
03:43:15,080 --> 03:43:16,400
Thank you.

6491
03:43:16,840 --> 03:43:18,480
Holy fuck, that's crazy.

6492
03:43:19,220 --> 03:43:21,640
Yeah, you know, he needed to be taught a lesson, though.

6493
03:43:21,800 --> 03:43:24,640
Like poodles, poodles have it too good for too long.

6494
03:43:25,040 --> 03:43:26,920
Anyway, guys, I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

6495
03:43:27,200 --> 03:43:27,940
Bye, guys.

6496
03:43:28,140 --> 03:43:28,840
Bye!

6497
03:43:28,840 --> 03:43:29,380
Bye!
