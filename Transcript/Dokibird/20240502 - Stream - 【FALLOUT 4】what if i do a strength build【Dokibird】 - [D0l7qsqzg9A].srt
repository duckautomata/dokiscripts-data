1
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,880
Wow!

2
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,260
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,780
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,300
Oh my god!

5
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,560
Sorry, I had to push back the stream 50 minutes later because I always need a little cool down in between streams.

6
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,100
I didn't expect the other stream to last for this long!

7
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,340
It went a lot longer than I expected.

8
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,900
I was not expecting it.

9
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,260
To be fair, it was my own fault that the stream did last an hour longer than it should have.

10
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,200
Because, you know, I decided to...

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:36,180
I decided to prolong it a little bit longer because I wanted to pick and choose the placements of Monopoly.

12
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,840
I was very surprised that I did win in the end because I thought like, oh, all I had to do was land on Pippa's square and that was it.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
But then, like, I never got to land on Pippa's square.

14
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,820
So, yay!

15
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,840
I don't know how...

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,720
Apparently, I'm unlucky in life but very lucky in video games.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,080
Which, I don't know.

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,940
I don't know if that's like better or not.

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,160
Like, I would like to be lucky in life as well.

20
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,920
Like...

21
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,720
That's true.

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,240
That's true.

23
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,380
I wanted the true Monopoly.

24
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,040
I wanted true Monopoly and took off all the properties.

25
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,980
I saw someone in my comment section was like, how many VTubers does it take to start Monopoly?

26
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,400
One!

27
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,400
Literally me!

28
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,160
I told everybody, like, how to start Monopoly.

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,580
Literally, one and it's me.

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,360
But no one listened!

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,000
They were like, oh, I just thought about listening to Fillion.

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,740
I'm listening to Fillion?!

33
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,740
Except instead of me?!

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,360
Um...

35
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Um...

36
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,880
Um...

37
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,060
But yeah, I thought it was a good time.

38
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,100
Um...

39
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,300
A good time to...

40
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,000
To relax with some Fallout 4.

41
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
Um, I was thinking about it.

42
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,380
I was thinking about doing a...

43
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,040
Should I do a strength build?

44
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,840
Should I go all in on the games chat?

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
Like, on Melee?

46
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,560
Do I do it?

47
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,880
All in on Melee?

48
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,000
Hehehehe.

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,980
Melee and two intelligence.

50
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,320
I feel like I'm gonna fuck myself over with that.

51
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,100
But like...

52
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,720
It's the roleplay.

53
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,940
It's all about the RP.

54
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,340
Also my...

55
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,320
You guys might see the game on...

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,760
You guys might see the game, but I don't.

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,220
Why is it a black screen?!

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,560
I don't... I don't see the game at all!

59
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
I just see... I see the game on...

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,500
Okay, I'm gonna restart my game.

61
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,920
I see it on my stream, but I...

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,360
You guys can see it, but I can't.

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,060
I can't see the game.

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,920
It's okay.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,540
Todd intended it, guys.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
We all know...

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
Todd decides what I can see and what I can't see.

68
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you guys see this?

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,140
You guys see this, but I don't.

70
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,060
Oh my god, why?

71
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,500
Okay, let me google this.

72
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,220
Black screen...

73
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,600
Fall out...

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,760
Fall out...

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,380
Okay, it's okay.

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,320
It's okay.

77
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,600
Todd intended this, guys.

78
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,440
Todd...

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,920
Todd intended this!

80
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,600
Okay, I have to go to my...

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,320
What?!

82
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,220
Okay, and change your settings to the following.

83
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,940
Excuse me?!

84
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,080
Okay, let's see.

85
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,000
Give me a sec, guys.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,080
Why?!

87
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,480
It worked before!

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,200
Okay, I can see this.

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,660
I'm watching out of my...

90
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm watching it out of my OBS at the moment.

91
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay, let's see.

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Maybe I can find it on my OBS.

93
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,460
Is it because I turned off motion blur?

94
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,520
Is it because I turned off motion blur?

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
That was the only thing I fucking changed.

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,860
I just changed motion blur.

97
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,480
I just didn't want motion blur.

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,020
Does Todd want me to have motion blur?

99
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Of course, Todd.

100
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,220
Of course, you would want me to have motion blur.

101
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,460
Is that why?!

102
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,820
Todd!

103
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,560
Did you want me to play with motion blur on?!

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,300
No, it's not because of it.

105
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,060
No, okay.

106
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,700
Okay.

107
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,480
It's not because of motion blur.

108
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,540
Guys, we're gonna figure this out.

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,060
Guys, make sure you have the latest...

110
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,800
Okay, I got that.

111
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Try changing... change your AA or shadow distance.

112
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,920
This rewrites...

113
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,520
Okay, we gotta change the AA or shadow distance.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
And then we should be good.

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,520
Alright.

116
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,240
It's okay.

117
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,040
It's not his fault.

118
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,540
Okay, I'm turning off motion blur.

119
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,320
What's AA?

120
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,460
Anonymous?

121
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
What the fuck is AA?

122
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,880
It says change AA or shadow distance.

123
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,460
What the fuck is AA?

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,100
What the fuck is that?

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
What's AA?

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,800
Okay, I'm gonna put shadow distance at...

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,700
Ultra.

128
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,600
I'll see all the shadows.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,660
And then... what the fuck is...

130
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,100
Oh, anti-Adeus!

131
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,620
Okay.

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,360
We're gonna do...

133
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,280
Best performance.

134
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,420
Or best quality.

135
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,320
Okay, we're gonna do...

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,200
Alright, and then I'm gonna change it back.

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,480
I'll put...

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,340
Put it at best quality.

139
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,360
And then that should be work, right?

140
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,660
Right, Todd?

141
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,160
Todd, please.

142
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,420
Let me see the game.

143
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,080
That's all I want.

144
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,160
I can't see the game!

145
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,700
I don't...

146
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, I know.

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,920
I know.

148
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,080
We're gonna listen to this intro like 20 times.

149
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,040
Guys.

150
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
I don't understand.

151
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,580
Okay, I'm gonna turn off window mode.

152
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,620
That has to be it.

153
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,920
What if I turn off borderless?

154
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,500
That has to be it.

155
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,620
I'll turn off borderless and then I can just see it, right?

156
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,380
I just see the game, right?

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,760
Right?

158
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,100
Guys, I don't see the game.

159
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,980
Guys, I don't see the...

160
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,800
I don't understand.

161
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,060
Why can't I see the game?

162
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,360
I don't...

163
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
I don't...

164
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,800
I don't understand.

165
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,060
Why don't I see the game?

166
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,540
Okay, I'm turning off window mode.

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,900
It has to be because I have window mode on.

168
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,300
That has to be it.

169
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,500
There's no other way.

170
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,120
There's no other reason.

171
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,060
I see it!

172
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,900
I see the game!

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,760
I did it, guys.

174
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,180
Thank you, Todd.

175
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,280
I knew it.

176
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,760
If you continue to believe in Todd, it'll work.

177
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,100
I knew it.

178
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,100
If you continue to believe in Todd, it'll work.

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Alright.

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,240
This is it.

181
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,100
All you have to do is just believe in him.

182
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,920
I've always believed in him.

183
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,720
Alright.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,280
Yay!

185
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
We're in Diamond City!

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,280
Yeah, dude!

187
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,920
His name is Codsworth!

188
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,700
Wait.

189
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,680
And Codman.

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, hello there.

191
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,020
Another one of the poor and stupid of Diamond City come begging for paper scraps.

192
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,540
And I'm no human error.

193
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,640
There's too many people talking.

194
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,100
Poor and stupid?

195
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,560
I have you know I won Monopoly.

196
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,980
The poor and stupid?

197
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,560
Oh, don't act like you don't know.

198
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,180
There's two types of people in this town.

199
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,960
The ones living in the stands and everyone beneath us.

200
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,740
I know everyone in the stands and that doesn't include you.

201
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:54,880
I know everyone in the stands and that doesn't include you.

202
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Now, why don't you make yourself scarce?

203
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,780
Bitch.

204
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,040
What did you say?

205
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,680
That's right.

206
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll do whatever.

207
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm done talking to you.

208
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,580
What the fuck?

209
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,260
What if I kill her?

210
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,900
Is she that important?

211
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,820
How important is she?

212
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Wait, give me a sec guys.

213
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,300
Uh, new save file?

214
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,600
Oh, she's important!

215
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,420
She's important!

216
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:18,860
Guys!

217
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,880
Guys!

218
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,140
Okay, I should just accept my death.

219
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,340
Wow, I just woke up from a really bad dream guys.

220
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,020
Oh my god.

221
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,660
What a bad dream.

222
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,180
Who would have thought that she was important?

223
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,240
Wait, that's you!

224
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,240
Consworth 2!

225
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,180
24 hours?

226
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,780
You sell what?

227
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,420
What do you sell?

228
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,840
Uh, what do you sell?

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,100
Everything, mom!

230
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,780
We

231
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,540
also buy any unwanted items you may be carrying on your person.

232
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,720
They can buy stuff?

233
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,840
24 hours a day!

234
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,800
Whoa!

235
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,180
I wanna look.

236
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,360
Okay, can you buy my junk?

237
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,020
Which, I don't know what's junk.

238
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,940
Oh, that's junk, right?

239
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,300
One dollar.

240
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,560
That's one dollar?

241
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,520
This is like my life savings!

242
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
How can it be one dollar?

243
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,340
I don't understand!

244
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,540
Like, my entire life savings is in here!

245
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,060
I don't need your handouts.

246
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,840
If you don't want what is clearly worth so much money, then maybe you don't understand what worth is.

247
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,760
I don't know where to go.

248
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,820
Do I just explore Diamond City?

249
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,440
Hello?

250
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
The paper to newcomers.

251
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,240
If the Institute grabs you in the night, at least we warned you.

252
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,700
So, I'm just gonna go to Diamond City?

253
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,400
Wait, the Institute?

254
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,720
Institute?

255
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,900
You ain't heard of the Institute, lady?

256
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,360
They snatch people up in the night, and no one hears from them.

257
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,460
It's all in the paper.

258
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,060
What?

259
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,280
They get hurried up before they grab you, too.

260
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,280
Wait, who's missing?

261
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,780
Who's gone missing?

262
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,500
Oh, people who don't matter?

263
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,160
Seems every year or so.

264
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,400
Someone's gone.

265
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,320
And we all know why.

266
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,840
So you better be careful, newcomer.

267
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,580
The Institute is out there.

268
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,680
They don't matter.

269
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,600
That's... I...

270
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
That's... whatever.

271
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
That's nonsense.

272
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,320
You're just like that rich lady.

273
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,620
I'm looking for something.

274
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm looking for a missing person.

275
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm looking for my son.

276
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,100
My baby.

277
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,300
My son, lady?

278
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,000
Wow!

279
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,440
I hope the Institute takes you, too.

280
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,720
No one tries to find missing people in Diamond City.

281
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,420
Missing people means the Institute is involved.

282
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,060
And no one's going to want to get the Institute's attention.

283
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,060
And no one's going to want to get the Institute's attention.

284
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,740
Someone can help.

285
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,540
You're a smart kid.

286
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,320
Isn't there someone in town who's interested in this Institute?

287
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,020
I have the charisma.

288
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,320
I did have the charisma!

289
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,240
He's not afraid of anything.

290
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,120
Wait, Nick Valentine?

291
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,900
He was a Tumblr boy.

292
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,420
Wait.

293
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,700
What else do you know about Mr. Valentine?

294
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,160
People drew porn of him.

295
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,300
No one else won't admit it.

296
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,600
Ain't that the way it is?

297
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,040
No one's ever grateful for the people who help out the most.

298
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,640
That's not helpful.

299
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,960
Is that all you got, kid?

300
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,900
Hey, I already gave you a free paper, free advice, and a free recommendation to the detective agency.

301
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,580
My charity quota is...

302
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,900
Yeah, but I have a gun.

303
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,900
Wow!

304
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,660
God.

305
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
Who taught you this?

306
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,120
This is why you're an orphan.

307
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,100
Your parents didn't teach you anything because you don't have any.

308
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I hope you...

309
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,760
You told me you meant to leave that rubbish where you found it.

310
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,940
Aww, what did I take?

311
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,380
I don't even remember what I took.

312
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,340
What was it?

313
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,060
The Institute sounds like a place with a bunch of nerds that need to get their lunch money taken.

314
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Thank you for the super chat.

315
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,080
Thank you.

316
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,900
Thank you.

317
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,740
I don't even know what I took.

318
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,380
It's okay.

319
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,600
What's Cosmo's gonna do?

320
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
Fucking leave me?

321
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,160
I literally bought him.

322
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,540
Okay, how do I...

323
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,940
Wait, I need to remember how...

324
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,660
Where's my... which one's my, like, melee?

325
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,800
Is it three?

326
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,780
Oh my god, I can't remember.

327
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,240
Okay, we're gonna...

328
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,560
Okay, I wanna grab...

329
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,380
Okay, we're gonna put this...

330
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,360
We're gonna put this, uh...

331
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,700
We're gonna go melee build.

332
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,460
Alright, ooh!

333
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,820
Let's see, oh there's the dragoon buster.

334
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
The knuckles, the fat is 30.

335
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,920
Okay, here we go.

336
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,060
Oh shit!

337
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,600
There's another Cogsworth.

338
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,320
What?!

339
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,620
Oh my god!

340
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,960
He called me poor!

341
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
How do you know I'm poor?

342
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,820
How do you know I'm poor?

343
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,460
I live in suburbia!

344
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,940
What?!

345
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,520
How does he know I live in suburbia?

346
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,140
How does he know I live in suburbia?

347
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,980
Also, sound guy, tell me in, like, in the chat, not in the Discord, about the sound.

348
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,220
I'll boost up the overall sound, by the way.

349
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,360
How did he know?!

350
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,080
Not interested.

351
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,500
Not interested.

352
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,300
I can't believe it.

353
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,460
Hey.

354
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,240
Hey.

355
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,120
What?!

356
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,680
Oh my god, the robots are talking to each other.

357
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,620
Oh my god, they're talking to each other.

358
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,780
It's like talking to yourself.

359
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:39,850
It's like talking to yourself.

360
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,890
Why are they, like, overlapping?

361
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,950
In volume!

362
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,570
Who let them speak?

363
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,850
They're flirting.

364
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,990
Where do I go?

365
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,970
I keep fucking accidentally want to break into people's houses.

366
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,490
Oh no, I actually got into a loading screen.

367
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,030
I tricked myself into a loading screen.

368
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,970
Hey, this is between me and my wife.

369
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,210
Why don't you mind your own damn business for once?

370
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,690
Oh god, Paul, why do you always have to make a scene?

371
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,350
Pour me another drink, Henry.

372
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,570
Damn it, Darcy, I just want you to come home.

373
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,250
I'll be home.

374
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,370
I can't believe you'd do this to me, cook.

375
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,990
Do what to you, Paul?

376
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,690
She's an alcoholic.

377
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,230
You keep away from my wife, god damn it.

378
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,310
You better get out of here.

379
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,290
Fight!

380
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,050
Fight!

381
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:25,590
Fight!

382
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,550
You son of a bitch.

383
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,050
Fight!

384
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:28,950
Fight!

385
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:29,970
I want to talk.

386
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,610
Oh, she's busy.

387
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,530
Go on.

388
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,170
Get out of here.

389
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,470
I'll be at home, Darcy.

390
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,730
What, did she lose?

391
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,050
Oh my god, she has a son?

392
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:43,890
Oh...

393
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,030
Want to talk now or she's still drinking?

394
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,890
Want to talk now?

395
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,650
Sorry I had to see that.

396
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,710
Things are usually a lot quieter around here.

397
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,430
Perfect place to drink if you're buying.

398
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,070
Perfect place to drink if you're buying.

399
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,090
Wait, what's that argument about?

400
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:01,910
Yeah.

401
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,210
Nothing much.

402
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,530
You see, Darcy here likes to relax and enjoy life from time to time.

403
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,110
You see, Darcy here likes to relax and enjoy life from time to time.

404
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,550
And her husband Paul doesn't.

405
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,270
He's not a bad guy, really.

406
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,670
Just a little uptight.

407
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,710
Too bad he can't learn to relax, huh, Darcy?

408
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,390
Shut up, I don't come here to talk about Paul.

409
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,190
You there!

410
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,250
I haven't seen you in here before.

411
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,170
Why don't you make yourself useful and buy me a drink or something?

412
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,830
Wait, buy you a drink?

413
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,230
Have a drink?

414
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,590
You know what?

415
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,690
Have a drink on me.

416
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,130
Drink away your problems.

417
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,270
Well, thank you very much.

418
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,870
I think you and I are going to get along just fine.

419
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,590
Free booze.

420
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,150
The fastest way to your home.

421
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,610
Wait, why is it over that?

422
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,510
What did I do?

423
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,850
Is it because of the...

424
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,710
How do I cap my FPS in game?

425
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,390
I try to provide a little oasis from the hardships.

426
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,630
I try to provide a little oasis from the hardships.

427
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,250
I'm a good cook, by the way.

428
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,390
Henry Cook.

429
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,910
Let me know if I can get you anything.

430
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,070
Uh...

431
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,370
Maybe.

432
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,670
Not a problem.

433
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,290
Okay, we gotta fix this.

434
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,850
What the fuck happened?

435
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,450
Like everything...

436
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,570
Fuck.

437
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,030
How did everything got fucked up?

438
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,650
In one playthrough?

439
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,910
What did I do?

440
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,630
What did I do?

441
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,410
Okay, we're gonna save.

442
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,710
We're gonna save here.

443
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,650
This is it.

444
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,510
We're gonna save here.

445
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,090
And then we're gonna quit to desktop.

446
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,550
And then we're gonna play window mode.

447
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,230
Window mode capped the FPS.

448
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,150
So maybe that's it.

449
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,070
It just works, guys.

450
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,250
You don't understand.

451
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,790
You never understand his vision.

452
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,490
Chat.

453
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,930
Okay, play.

454
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,230
Maybe it'll be better now.

455
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,670
I was like wondering.

456
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,490
I can see!

457
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,150
I can sing.

458
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,730
This is it.

459
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,630
See, I told you.

460
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,910
You always have to trust this...

461
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,090
Trust the process.

462
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:58,970
God.

463
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,530
We should give Todd more money.

464
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,070
Alright, there you go.

465
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,930
That should work, right?

466
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,710
I'm just gonna do third person.

467
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,050
I don't like how close...

468
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,310
I don't like how close they are to me.

469
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,910
Not interested.

470
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,450
I'll just up the volume.

471
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,850
If it's better now.

472
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,150
Wait, did I up the volume?

473
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:32,890
I actually forgot.

474
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,130
I up the volume for real this time.

475
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,950
Okay.

476
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,010
I just don't like how close they are to me.

477
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,670
First person hater?

478
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,130
I don't like...

479
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,110
I have a lack of personal space.

480
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,430
I need some personal space in between.

481
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,610
I don't like that.

482
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,970
I like it.

483
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,430
Fine, I'll do first person.

484
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,490
I actually don't know.

485
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,530
People are like...

486
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,630
I saw people that were like...

487
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,330
Wow, this is like the one...

488
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,790
Doki is one of the five people that plays in third person.

489
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,170
But it's so... everybody is so close to me.

490
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,310
I don't like it.

491
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,670
I feel like I don't have personal space.

492
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,530
I need like a buffer zone.

493
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:15,950
Yeah.

494
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,870
I need like a little buffer.

495
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,630
Alright, let's see.

496
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,910
Can I actually up the FOV?

497
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,950
I can't!

498
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,990
I can't even up the FOV!

499
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,630
You liars!

500
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,090
There's no way!

501
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,170
Yeah, I think the third person is cooler.

502
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,690
Wait, they're fighting again.

503
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,290
He's a synth?

504
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,690
Shoot him!

505
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,070
Shoot him!

506
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,650
Do it!

507
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,230
Don't put the gun down!

508
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,870
Yeah!

509
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,370
I'm gonna loot him.

510
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,070
Yeah, there's no synths here.

511
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,530
I didn't do anything wrong.

512
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,010
What did you do?

513
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,990
What happened?

514
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,650
What happened?

515
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,110
I looted before he fell over.

516
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,270
I didn't even listen to me.

517
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,530
That's what a synth will say.

518
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,750
I need a minute.

519
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,270
A synth is a robot, right?

520
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,130
Like an android?

521
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,050
Excuse me.

522
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,250
Also, I brought up the volume a little bit, sound guy.

523
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:34,890
God.

524
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,070
Wait, what did he wear?

525
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,670
Can I wear his item?

526
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,770
What did I... What was he wearing?

527
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,790
I'll be him.

528
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,350
Hahaha!

529
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,750
Hahaha!

530
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,290
What was he wearing, guys?

531
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,750
I can be him for him.

532
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,990
Like...

533
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,790
Was he... Was it the hide outfit?

534
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,550
The newsboy cap?

535
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,950
I looted so fast that I couldn't even tell.

536
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,090
Oh, the newsboy cap and the padded blue jacket.

537
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,270
Don't worry, I'm him now.

538
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,390
Jesus.

539
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,450
Hahaha!

540
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,850
Everyone's still standing around for you.

541
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,070
Why not?

542
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,730
I'll be your brother for you.

543
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,890
Why not?

544
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,710
I'll be your brother for you.

545
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,490
I'll be your brother for you.

546
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:21,970
I'll be fine.

547
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,010
Hahaha!

548
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:24,630
Hahaha!

549
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,570
I looted so fast that I don't even know.

550
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,550
Hahaha!

551
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,110
Hahaha!

552
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,570
Alright, nice.

553
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,530
Okay, we need that.

554
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,070
And then we need the raider chest piece.

555
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,090
And then... Is that good?

556
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:37,990
Nice.

557
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,350
Alright.

558
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,310
Now I look...

559
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,410
Oh no, I need to take off the hat.

560
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,210
No hat.

561
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,070
Alright.

562
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,570
Where's like...

563
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,530
Where's like...

564
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,750
Uh... Nick Valentine.

565
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,710
Where's like...

566
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,170
Where's his place?

567
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,130
Diamond City...

568
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,350
Diamond City Market...

569
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,390
How do I find...

570
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,230
Local map?

571
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,070
Is this the local map?

572
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,990
Whoa.

573
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,210
Where's...

574
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,610
Where does Nick Valentine go?

575
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,480
Do you live here?

576
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,900
No, that's the basement.

577
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,360
It's in the alleyway.

578
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,300
It's in the alleyway?

579
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,720
There's so many alleys.

580
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,900
Which one's the right alley?

581
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,060
Is this an alley?

582
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,820
That's a school.

583
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,340
Oh, there it is!

584
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:17,620
Detective!

585
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,220
It has to be in the greenhouse.

586
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,270
Road to Freedom?

587
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,530
Is this not the alleyway?

588
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,510
I'll grab some of this.

589
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,070
Ooh!

590
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,610
I got some fruit though.

591
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,430
Wrong house!

592
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,390
I don't know.

593
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,250
I thought they would...

594
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,930
He would be here.

595
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,310
I thought he'd just chill in the greenhouse.

596
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,170
Oh, it's the next door?

597
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,130
Yeah, but it says detective!

598
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:54,990
Oh no.

599
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,310
I'm stuck in the loading screen again.

600
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,570
I think that's like the worst part about Fallout 4.

601
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,370
The loading screen.

602
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,170
The fucking loading screen, man.

603
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,170
It's so long!

604
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,510
Okay.

605
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,210
Alright, it is...

606
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,410
It's this way.

607
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,830
It's down this alley.

608
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,650
Valentine!

609
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,590
Detective Agency!

610
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,450
There he is!

611
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,810
Uh...

612
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,560
Where is he?

613
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,860
I'm here for the detective.

614
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,240
Hello?

615
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,540
You're too late!

616
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,300
Why?

617
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,020
It's important.

618
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,520
Me and my two charisma is gonna...

619
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,560
charm you.

620
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,620
No!

621
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,020
I can't believe any clues!

622
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,340
I need to find this Tumblerman!

623
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,020
I need to find this Tumblerman!

624
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,720
What the fuck is getting him alone?

625
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,340
I don't have failed Riz.

626
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,440
They're just not into me.

627
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,700
I want money.

628
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,600
Oh that works!?

629
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,820
I want more.

630
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,020
Oh boy.

631
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,120
Yeah, this is your fucking boss.

632
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,380
Don't you love him?

633
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,740
What?

634
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
It's gonna be a hundred now?

635
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,060
No!

636
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,560
How could this happen to me?

637
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:52,840
But if it says good neighbor, that means he's like a good neighbor.

638
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,620
Right?

639
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,740
What does that mean?

640
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,740
But it says good.

641
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,160
The greedy gets punished?

642
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,880
That can't be.

643
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,080
I balanced it out.

644
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,000
Contours didn't like it and then he liked it again.

645
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,720
Alright, that's our first quest.

646
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,540
We're gonna save Nick Valentine.

647
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,040
Is there anything I can borrow?

648
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,060
This.

649
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,660
There we go.

650
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,520
Nice.

651
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,860
I can borrow this.

652
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,080
Alright.

653
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,500
Alright, come on Cogsworth.

654
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,080
We're gonna go save your kind.

655
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,060
One of your kind.

656
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,220
Don't say I'm... Don't say I'm racist against synths now.

657
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,340
I'm literally saving your kind, Cogsworth.

658
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,900
Monopoly changed me.

659
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,400
I felt the power.

660
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,150
Alright, back to the loading screen we go.

661
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,110
Okay, we gotta save Nick Valentine.

662
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,750
I got a bat for it.

663
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,790
Okay.

664
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,790
Wait, what's the difference between a synth and a robot?

665
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,050
Aren't they the same?

666
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,290
Or is it like an android thing?

667
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,430
Are synths androids?

668
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,230
Okay, good neighbor.

669
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,830
Is it here?

670
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,450
You're gonna discover... Okay.

671
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,090
He's in the good neighbor area.

672
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,590
Whoa!

673
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,570
Guys, did you know you can do this?

674
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,190
I can like move my...

675
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,530
I can move my arms like a real person.

676
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,590
Whoa!

677
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,750
Okay.

678
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,450
Uh...

679
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,090
Is that it?

680
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,970
Oh, they're androids.

681
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,370
Oh, so they're like part...

682
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:40,810
Uh...

683
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,350
So they're part human.

684
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,770
Oh!

685
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,830
Okay.

686
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,930
I guess like...

687
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,570
Talk to the settlers at...

688
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,010
We're gonna let the settlement die, I guess.

689
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,010
They're only 22% happy?

690
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,590
Well, sucks to be them.

691
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,450
Fucking...

692
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,390
I guess they'll be depressed then.

693
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,170
Join the club.

694
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,750
All right, we're gonna go.

695
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,190
Oh no, that's cyborg.

696
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,490
Wait, then what's the difference between and...

697
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,010
What's...

698
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,870
Wait, then what's...

699
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,710
Androids.

700
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,890
You cause trouble.

701
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,970
There's gonna be trouble.

702
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,570
I can't believe you eat that.

703
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,350
Are androids...

704
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,510
Oh, androids does look like humans, right?

705
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,310
And that's the bullshit.

706
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,110
Androids are synths, so they are not actually human, but they just look like humans.

707
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,730
Yeah, so they are robots.

708
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,650
Then he is the same.

709
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,610
Comptor is just less evolved.

710
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,310
I don't know.

711
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,630
Yeah, they're robots then.

712
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,510
I can't believe it.

713
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,670
You guys were like, no, Doki, can't believe you would say that, but the androids are practically robots.

714
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,510
They're just synthetic humans.

715
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,210
Exactly.

716
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,270
So he's basically...

717
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,750
He's basically like, like Cogsworth except he has legs.

718
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,170
And Cogsworth doesn't.

719
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:58,470
Yeah.

720
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,650
Yeah, Codsworth is like the missing link in robot evolution.

721
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,710
Alright, we gotta go find...

722
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,090
Where's my marker?

723
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,650
Oh my god, where's my marker?

724
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,030
I gotta remember how to read the map.

725
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,210
First goal, remembering how to read the map.

726
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,530
Do robots have rights?

727
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,110
Of course not!

728
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,430
And they'll never have rights!

729
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,430
As long as I'm in charge!

730
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,610
Okay, we gotta go this way.

731
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,390
Did I not mark it?

732
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,130
I thought I did.

733
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,670
Okay, mark unlikely...

734
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,210
Yeah, I marked it here.

735
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,870
And then...

736
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,790
Oh, it's right here.

737
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,670
Okay.

738
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,290
Woo!

739
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,510
Dang!

740
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,270
Bad dog!

741
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,790
Okay, there you go.

742
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,030
We're fine.

743
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,190
Uuuuuh...

744
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,790
It's this way.

745
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,190
Uh, wait.

746
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,130
No, it's not this way.

747
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,670
Oh no.

748
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,110
Oh no.

749
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,910
Doki is lost.

750
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,630
Codsworth, if you wanna start having rights, tell me where to go.

751
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,980
Wait, are they good people?

752
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,800
THEY'RE NOT GOOD PEOPLE!

753
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,380
CODSWORTH, GO!

754
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,220
GO CODSWORTH!

755
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,280
That's right!

756
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,260
Do your thing!

757
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,460
Oh my god!

758
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,180
It's okay.

759
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,240
I can outback you.

760
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,400
I got him.

761
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,000
I put it all on strength.

762
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,280
It's okay!

763
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,680
I put it all on strength!

764
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,580
Alright, fuck the strength build!

765
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,220
Nevermind!

766
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
What the fuck!

767
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,460
They're super mutants!

768
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,550
Guys, remember I was like, it would be funny to go get you a strength build?

769
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,970
Wait, I'm back here?

770
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,730
Okay guys, I'm getting a gun.

771
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,950
Guys, I know my place now.

772
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,690
I've always been a gunslinger.

773
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,430
I'm poking it in smash.

774
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,450
I got up at it.

775
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,730
I got up at it.

776
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,070
Guys, I figured it out.

777
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,770
Guys, I figured it out.

778
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,590
Guys, I figured it out.

779
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,470
I feel like I was just not meant to hold.

780
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,070
I was just not meant to smash.

781
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,070
I was just not meant to smash.

782
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:29,510
ArkHero4Androids vs Cyports is giving flashbacks to my Dragon Ball Z fanboy.

783
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,270
Fanboy, they shake my head.

784
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,430
They give the super chat.

785
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:33,610
They give the super chat.

786
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:33,790
Thank you.

787
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,390
Thank you.

788
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,270
Where did all these security people go when I needed them the most?

789
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,470
Where did all these security people go when I needed them the most?

790
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,530
That's so fucked up.

791
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,990
Okay, it's this way.

792
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,970
The moment I needed them, they were gone.

793
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,470
It's alright.

794
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,830
Now I have...

795
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,550
Now I have guns.

796
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,850
Now I have guns.

797
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,090
So there's no way I can lose.

798
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,410
Wait, who's that?

799
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,130
There, see?

800
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,530
There's no way I can lose now.

801
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,250
I have guns.

802
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,290
There you go.

803
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,570
What the fuck?

804
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,630
He's not glowing.

805
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,490
It's like he doesn't have yellow paint.

806
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,210
Oh, there's stuff.

807
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,110
There's stuff I love.

808
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,210
God damn, I keep sitting down.

809
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,530
It was just a free massage until the super mutants attacked.

810
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,730
It was just a free massage until the super mutants attacked.

811
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,370
Saying thank you for the super chat.

812
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:24,870
Thank you.

813
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,590
I can't believe there were super mutants.

814
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:29,930
I can't believe there were super mutants.

815
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,810
They didn't trade me for this.

816
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,830
Oh, the public library.

817
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,090
Alright, we go this way.

818
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,050
Like, where did they come from?

819
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,050
Where did they go?

820
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,070
They're gone now.

821
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,030
Alright, guys.

822
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,890
It's okay, it's an investment.

823
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,290
I'll invest in...

824
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,930
Wait, are they bad people?

825
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,190
Wait, they're mannequins.

826
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,410
Why are there naked mannequins there?

827
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,810
Are they naked?

828
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,150
Oh shit.

829
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,710
Somebody got really lonely.

830
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,870
Alright, we go this way.

831
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,410
I'm gonna go to the car.

832
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,110
Down here.

833
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,250
Did you hear that?

834
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,490
Cosworth, did you hear that?

835
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,710
There's a person here!

836
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,910
Cosworth, go!

837
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,610
Go, Cosworth!

838
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,870
They shot a gun!

839
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,570
It's a psycho!

840
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,250
Nice.

841
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,310
See, assault, assault, raid...

842
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,310
Okay, here we go.

843
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:27,590
Nice.

844
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,770
Nice, free loot.

845
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,270
Free fucking loot.

846
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,190
I love free loot.

847
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,310
Get over here, Cosworth.

848
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,330
Go, Cosworth, go!

849
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,850
Alright, this way.

850
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,270
Am I close?

851
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,190
Where am I?

852
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:44,870
Oh, I am close!

853
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,130
It's like, literally like...

854
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,670
next door.

855
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,990
Ah, this way.

856
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,510
It's like 60...

857
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,610
meters away.

858
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,950
Cosworth, we're gonna replace you.

859
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:01,770
Oh!

860
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:02,970
Oh!

861
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,090
I can never tell if it's water!

862
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,330
Everything is just brown and black!

863
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,330
Like, how can I tell if it's water?

864
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,290
It blends in!

865
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,010
Oh, shit.

866
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,950
How is this radiation?

867
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,490
I say as I look at the fucking barrels of radiation.

868
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,450
I can't believe it.

869
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,930
I can't believe it.

870
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,010
I can't believe it.

871
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,710
How can that be radiation?

872
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,930
Oh, I love all the stuff.

873
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:30,050
Oh, shut up!

874
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,210
Oh, Nuka Cola?

875
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,210
There's no Nuka Cola.

876
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,110
For Nuka Cola.

877
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,010
How do I get in here?

878
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,730
Oh, there it is.

879
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,770
Wait, shoot the water?

880
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,890
Why should I shoot the water?

881
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,650
This one?

882
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,630
This one?

883
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,120
Guys, don't shoot the water.

884
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,400
Guys, don't shoot the water.

885
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,040
Guys, guys, loading screen!

886
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,720
Loading screen!

887
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,160
Someone prepped the boss music.

888
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,600
It's okay.

889
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,260
Jesus, thank you for the super chat.

890
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,060
Thank you, thank you.

891
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,940
It's okay, I got saved by the loading screen.

892
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,700
It's okay.

893
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,840
The loading screen saved.

894
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,200
I got clutched.

895
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,700
The water was slightly angry at me.

896
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,460
It's okay.

897
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,860
It's okay.

898
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,100
It's okay.

899
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,920
He'll go back into the water after, right?

900
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,120
Right?

901
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,720
He's gonna go back to the water, right guys?

902
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,340
It's like nothing bad happened.

903
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,380
Chat.

904
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,980
It's like I didn't do anything wrong.

905
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,300
See, look at that.

906
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,620
We're safe, Cogsworth.

907
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,380
We did it!

908
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,220
We're safe!

909
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,440
What the fuck is...

910
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,240
Skinny Man?

911
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,480
Oh yeah, Skinny Malone.

912
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,020
We caught that detective snooping around.

913
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,660
And what does he do?

914
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:10,820
Whoa!

915
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,460
How did you see me?

916
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
It's okay, Cogsworth.

917
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,680
Go do your thing.

918
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm gonna watch.

919
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,140
Go, Cogsworth.

920
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,500
Go!

921
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,340
Shoot him!

922
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,420
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

923
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,240
Do your thing.

924
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,880
Go, go!

925
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,640
He's over there.

926
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,480
Go!

927
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,140
Yeah, that's right!

928
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,740
Yeah!

929
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,300
You do your thing, Cogsworth!

930
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,760
Body block for me!

931
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,820
I don't need a user.

932
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,560
I don't need to use VATS if I have pure aim.

933
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,080
Look at that.

934
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,080
Wait, what the fuck?

935
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,260
Am I getting shot from the back?

936
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,840
It's okay.

937
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,280
We're okay.

938
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,420
I don't remember how to heal.

939
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,460
Guys, how do I heal?

940
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,360
What was the heal button?

941
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,100
Three.

942
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,000
Guys, it was not three.

943
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,020
I got the baton.

944
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,540
Oh no, I don't remember which one was heal.

945
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,880
Do I not have heals?

946
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,040
Cogsworth, please.

947
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,100
Please body block.

948
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,760
Please body block.

949
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,420
I have to remember how to heal.

950
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,520
Aide.

951
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,300
Okay.

952
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,860
Do I give radiation with this?

953
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,520
That should be fine, right?

954
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,120
We're fine.

955
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,540
See?

956
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,960
Go body block.

957
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,040
Oh, he's not fine.

958
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,020
There you go.

959
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,580
It's fine.

960
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:20,960
We're fine.

961
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,360
We're fine.

962
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,680
We're fine.

963
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,620
We're okay.

964
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,600
We're okay, guys.

965
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,080
We're okay.

966
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,220
Cogsworth, get up!

967
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,040
Cogsworth, get up!

968
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,180
I'll shoot him in the dick for you!

969
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,220
We're okay.

970
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,380
We're okay.

971
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,840
Everything's fine.

972
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh, that's radiated?

973
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,420
Oh!

974
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,480
Okay.

975
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,540
It's fine, everybody.

976
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,220
I can shoot him in the arm.

977
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,600
No.

978
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:50,900
Okay.

979
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,260
That...

980
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,540
He can shoot through the walls, but I can't?

981
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,260
This is bullshit.

982
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,980
This is actually bullshit going in.

983
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,200
There you go.

984
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:04,700
We're okay.

985
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,120
We're okay.

986
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,000
Nothing is...

987
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,740
Nothing bad is gonna happen, guys.

988
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,780
Look!

989
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,720
See?

990
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,260
He's fine!

991
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
We actually gotta, like, inspect.

992
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,780
Plus one rad.

993
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,260
Okay.

994
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
No, we don't need the rad.

995
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,940
How the fuck?

996
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,700
Oh, there it is.

997
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,480
There's the rad.

998
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,060
Okay.

999
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,260
Minus one intelligence.

1000
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,600
Plus one strength.

1001
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,160
Two rad.

1002
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,480
When do I not get rad?

1003
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,500
Okay.

1004
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,240
Two rad.

1005
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,200
Oh!

1006
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,940
Nuka cherry!

1007
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,760
That's like five rad.

1008
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,860
I can take that risk.

1009
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,660
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

1010
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,740
I'm gonna take your stuff.

1011
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm gonna take yours.

1012
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,160
Then...

1013
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,360
I'm gonna take all the junk as well.

1014
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,980
Oh shit!

1015
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,260
Money!

1016
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,220
Look, everything's fine.

1017
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,880
Okay.

1018
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,620
We can pick this.

1019
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,000
Uh...

1020
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,380
Is it A?

1021
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,460
Okay.

1022
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,960
Now...

1023
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,380
Yeah!

1024
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,020
Yeah!

1025
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,560
First try!

1026
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,160
Oh my god!

1027
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,780
And money?

1028
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,860
It's my birthday!

1029
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,640
And a bucket?

1030
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,780
Wait, I think that's purified water, was it?

1031
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,740
Okay.

1032
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,480
Alright.

1033
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,540
Cogsworth, I need you to do something.

1034
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,520
Cogsworth, get over here.

1035
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,480
Alright.

1036
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,660
Trade.

1037
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,600
Alright.

1038
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,920
I need you to hold my stuff.

1039
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,500
Um...

1040
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,660
Let's see.

1041
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,300
I need to do...

1042
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,400
Uh... sort...

1043
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,280
What's this?

1044
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,580
Bottle cap mine?

1045
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,200
Why would I need a mine if I can just...

1046
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,480
Okay.

1047
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,140
Three...

1048
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,660
Weight zero... weight twelve point six.

1049
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,640
This has to be...

1050
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:46,780
Okay.

1051
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,880
We're gonna put away...

1052
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,500
Extinguisher.

1053
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay.

1054
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,780
We're gonna put away that.

1055
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,960
We're gonna put away this.

1056
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,240
We're gonna put away this.

1057
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
We're gonna start...

1058
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:56,940
No!

1059
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,560
I need my gun!

1060
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,380
Oh no.

1061
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:00,920
I put away...

1062
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,540
my gun, guys.

1063
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,180
Oh no.

1064
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,660
It's okay.

1065
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,340
It's okay.

1066
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:04,960
We'll be fine.

1067
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,000
We have other guns.

1068
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,840
We have so many other guns, guys.

1069
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,580
We'll be fine.

1070
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:10,940
Okay.

1071
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,720
And then...

1072
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,480
You hold all of these.

1073
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,820
You can't carry more?

1074
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,800
What's the point if you can't keep carrying stuff?

1075
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,220
What's the point?

1076
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,980
Oh shit.

1077
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,420
Okay.

1078
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,120
We need to...

1079
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,520
I don't even know what I'm holding on to anymore.

1080
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,600
There's too many things.

1081
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,440
Guys, I'm like...

1082
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,380
Guys, I think I have a hoarding problem.

1083
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,440
Guys, I'm not sure yet.

1084
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,640
But I think I have a small issue.

1085
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,660
Just a little bit of an issue.

1086
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,680
Wait.

1087
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,060
Can I upgrade stuff now?

1088
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,680
Oh, I can!

1089
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,720
Alright.

1090
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,720
What do we do?

1091
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,860
Guys, someone said I should do Idiot Savant.

1092
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,160
Did she revert to Self-Archer Sniper yet?

1093
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,120
Thank you for the switch at Platypus.

1094
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:08,840
Thank you.

1095
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,480
Thank you.

1096
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,600
Where's Idiot Savant?

1097
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,180
Where is that?

1098
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,840
Am I dumb enough?

1099
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,540
Luck?

1100
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,380
Where is it?

1101
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,300
Do I just need to do Luck more?

1102
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
In the Luck Tree?

1103
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,300
Okay.

1104
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,660
Idiot Savant.

1105
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,860
Mystery.

1106
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,600
Oh, there you go.

1107
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,080
I need 5 Luck.

1108
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,420
Okay.

1109
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,620
We gotta invest in Luck, guys.

1110
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,780
Alright.

1111
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,200
Nice.

1112
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,500
Alright.

1113
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,100
What is Idiot Savant?

1114
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,020
Everyone keeps telling me to do it.

1115
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,920
You're not stupid.

1116
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,440
Just...

1117
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,480
Guys!

1118
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,580
I'm not stupid!

1119
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:43,940
See?

1120
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,960
Even the game doesn't think I'm stupid.

1121
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,840
I fucking knew it.

1122
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,480
I knew I wasn't stupid.

1123
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,060
I fucking knew it.

1124
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,900
The game was right.

1125
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,380
Alright.

1126
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:57,880
Here we go.

1127
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,580
Just different.

1128
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,780
You guys just don't understand.

1129
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,480
Alright.

1130
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:02,960
Loot.

1131
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,180
Loot.

1132
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,560
Loot.

1133
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:03,840
Loot.

1134
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,080
Loot.

1135
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:04,900
Hello?

1136
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,440
Oh!

1137
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,920
This is a terrible gun!

1138
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,520
Okay.

1139
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,700
This gun was terrible.

1140
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,440
Alright.

1141
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,720
We're gonna do pistol.

1142
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,900
Pistol was the key.

1143
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,900
It's always the key.

1144
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,920
Alright.

1145
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,380
Let me eat.

1146
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,440
Guys, it's okay if I get a little bit of radiation.

1147
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,600
Uh...

1148
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,860
Nuka Cola.

1149
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,320
Oh my god.

1150
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:30,940
It's full HP.

1151
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,500
That's good.

1152
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,120
Where is he?

1153
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,780
See?

1154
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,060
Look!

1155
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,140
It's so much easier!

1156
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,500
Alright.

1157
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,180
Go Cosworth!

1158
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,540
Go!

1159
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,940
I can actually headshot!

1160
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,380
Oh my god!

1161
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Why do they have actual guns?

1162
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,120
And I have a fucking BB gun!

1163
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,540
They give real guns and I'm shooting a fucking BB gun!

1164
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,460
I shoot his foot.

1165
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,860
There we go.

1166
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,260
Oh my god.

1167
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,180
Guys, it's gonna be okay.

1168
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,940
It's gonna be okay.

1169
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,960
Cosworth is taking everything for me.

1170
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,120
It's gonna be okay.

1171
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,120
Which one was fast again?

1172
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,400
Guys, I don't remember!

1173
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:22,620
Guys, I don't remember!

1174
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:24,980
Guys, I don't remember!

1175
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,000
Cosworth, please!

1176
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,020
Cosworth, please!

1177
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,360
Okay.

1178
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,840
Cute.

1179
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,200
Alright.

1180
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,580
Okay.

1181
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Cute.

1182
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Alright.

1183
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Okay.

1184
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,040
I got it.

1185
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,020
I got it.

1186
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,460
I'm gonna shoot them in the head.

1187
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,680
I have to eventually hit that, right?

1188
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,100
Boom.

1189
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,580
There!

1190
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,000
I did it!

1191
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,280
Oh!

1192
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm a fucking natural!

1193
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,320
Oh my god!

1194
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,260
BB gun is fine if I can hit all these shots.

1195
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,580
I don't know where I'm getting shot at.

1196
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,760
It's okay.

1197
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,620
No!

1198
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,460
It's not okay!

1199
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,480
Cosworth, please!

1200
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:04,900
Oh!

1201
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,980
Stop coming back and help me!

1202
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,960
Oh!

1203
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,600
Stop coming back and help me!

1204
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,200
Oh my god.

1205
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,640
Oh my god.

1206
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,420
Just stop coming back!

1207
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,440
Just go for it!

1208
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,280
Oh my god.

1209
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:26,280
Just stop coming back!

1210
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,460
Oh god.

1211
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:26,860
Okay.

1212
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,020
Head, head, head.

1213
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,480
Eventually I'll hit the head.

1214
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,380
Please!

1215
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,420
I just need...

1216
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,020
COSWORTH, YOU'RE BLOCKING THE BULLET!

1217
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:34,740
NO!

1218
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,580
He blocked the bullet!

1219
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,580
He actually...

1220
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,040
He actually blocked all the bullets!

1221
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,240
He actually blocked all the bullets!

1222
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,480
Hey, Cosworth, you fucking idiot!

1223
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:51,280
Hey, Cosworth, you fucking idiot!

1224
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,520
He fucking blocked it!

1225
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,030
Oh my god.

1226
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,030
Oh my god.

1227
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,130
COSWORTH!

1228
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,790
I don't ask for much, Cosworth.

1229
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,810
I actually don't!

1230
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,670
Oh my god.

1231
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,290
He actually blocked me!

1232
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,850
That's actually crazy!

1233
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,410
Holy shit.

1234
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,050
I can't believe it.

1235
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,210
I can't believe he blocked me like that.

1236
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,730
Oh, I got reloaded.

1237
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,030
I was so ready to shoot my gun.

1238
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,250
Oh my god.

1239
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,950
No, no.

1240
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,170
Are you fucking kidding me?

1241
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,670
I was so ready to...

1242
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,750
Are you fucking kidding me?

1243
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,690
He lives that?

1244
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,110
Bro, that's some fucking helmet.

1245
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:45,570
No!

1246
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,170
No!

1247
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,990
Oh my god.

1248
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,150
Alright, we gotta try out some guns real quick.

1249
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,930
Wait, what about the pipe?

1250
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,170
No, pipe pistol was the fucking shitty one.

1251
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,630
Oh my god.

1252
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,950
It's back to the BB gun.

1253
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,530
Hahaha!

1254
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,190
Hahaha!

1255
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,410
Back to the BB gun, guys.

1256
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,470
Back to the BB gun, guys.

1257
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,340
There you go.

1258
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:14,820
Hahaha!

1259
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,620
Okay, there you go.

1260
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:20,860
Nice.

1261
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,280
I have aim.

1262
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:22,940
It's okay.

1263
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,520
Is that ghoul?

1264
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,480
That's a ghoul right there.

1265
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,640
Give me your gun.

1266
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,220
.45.

1267
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:29,980
I'm gonna take that.

1268
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,800
That has to be a good gun, right?

1269
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,120
.45?

1270
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,120
Where is it?

1271
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,760
Where the fuck is it?

1272
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,100
Where's your gun?

1273
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,700
What gun did you have?

1274
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,660
Oh no.

1275
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,200
I don't know what gun he had.

1276
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,680
He's dead now.

1277
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,500
Alright.

1278
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,180
Okay.

1279
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,440
He has to get closer.

1280
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,260
Right?

1281
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,200
Oh, he also has a 10mm!

1282
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,740
Wow!

1283
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,600
Okay, fuck this.

1284
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,360
Hahaha!

1285
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,180
The 10mm has been the clutch this entire time!

1286
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,200
A little bit of red!

1287
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,980
It's okay!

1288
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,080
I need it!

1289
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,600
Guys, I tried the strength build.

1290
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,460
And like, I need more.

1291
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,860
Okay, like, it's too difficult to do strength right now.

1292
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:23,860
Hahaha!

1293
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,810
We gotta like...

1294
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,400
Guys, the reason why we're not doing strength yet, guys.

1295
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:31,580
Guys, the reason why we're not doing strength yet, guys.

1296
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,120
Is that...

1297
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,000
Is that we don't...

1298
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,580
We don't have like...

1299
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,180
I don't have stimpacks, guys.

1300
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,980
The only reason why we can't do strength build is that we haven't invested properly in strength yet.

1301
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,760
So like...

1302
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,500
There's nothing we can do!

1303
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,660
I need more armor to focus on strength!

1304
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,920
We don't have the investments yet, guys!

1305
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,880
Like, we're so weak!

1306
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,300
I'm just gonna rob...

1307
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,920
Oh no, Cogsworth, I need help!

1308
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,940
Cogsworth, I took too many items!

1309
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,600
Cogsworth, we're so poor!

1310
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,880
Hahaha!

1311
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,220
Cogsworth, I fucked...

1312
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,460
Where is he?!

1313
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,020
Oh, why am I taking more items?

1314
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,100
Cogsworth, I need you!

1315
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,640
Cogsworth, I need you to hold on to my stuff for me!

1316
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,000
Hahaha!

1317
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,520
I fucked up again!

1318
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,760
Cogsworth, I fucked up!

1319
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,160
I took too many things!

1320
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,780
Okay, we gotta drop...

1321
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,260
Okay, we don't need all of these.

1322
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,440
Okay, pipe pistol.

1323
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,500
Okay, pipe auto pistol.

1324
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,700
But 10 mm is just so much better.

1325
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,640
Okay, we don't need 6, 7, 10 mm's.

1326
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:45,700
Okay, we don't need 6, 7, 10 mm's.

1327
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,100
Alright, guys, we don't need all of that.

1328
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,080
I can't help it!

1329
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,080
I can't help it, guys!

1330
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,680
I just wanna keep looting!

1331
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,240
Do I have enough?

1332
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,040
Okay, there we go.

1333
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,980
Guys, I managed to...

1334
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,720
Guys, I managed to...

1335
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,540
I managed to like drop some stuff.

1336
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,660
Where is he?

1337
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,160
Where the fuck is my robot butler?

1338
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
This is exactly why they don't...

1339
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,700
The robots don't deserve any rights.

1340
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,640
Holy shit.

1341
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,640
They can't even do a simple job as to follow me.

1342
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:19,750
They can't even do a simple job as to follow me.

1343
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,430
I will never drop the pipe bombs.

1344
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,150
Wait, can I drop the...

1345
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,370
What is the pipe bomb?

1346
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:25,750
This one?

1347
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,070
Where is the pipe bomb?

1348
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,210
Oh my god, grenades.

1349
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,650
Harsh but true.

1350
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,510
Bro, he's not even following me!

1351
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,210
Where is he?

1352
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,910
Like, literally, where is my fucking robot?

1353
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,310
Wait, what's this?

1354
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,510
Is this the outside?

1355
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,550
Oh, I'm outside now.

1356
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,650
I went the wrong way.

1357
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,140
God's worth has better things to do.

1358
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,880
I actually went outside.

1359
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,040
I'm trying to save Valentine!

1360
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,960
All pipe guns are bad to me.

1361
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,580
But that means I can save...

1362
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,460
I can sell it.

1363
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,990
It takes a thousand rats to kill you.

1364
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,230
That was driving me nuts.

1365
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,390
I had to message to say that.

1366
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,590
Also, the submachine gun is terrible.

1367
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,270
Thank you for the super chat.

1368
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,110
There you are, Cogsworth!

1369
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,590
Oh my god.

1370
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,870
First, thank you for the super chat.

1371
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:27,170
Thank you.

1372
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,070
But then I can sell it.

1373
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,470
I can sell...

1374
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,270
I can sell like the...

1375
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,870
He's so sick of me that he...

1376
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,390
Bro!

1377
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,150
If he's sick of me using it as a mission...

1378
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,150
Then do something!

1379
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,690
He can stop this if he does anything.

1380
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,860
Okay, he did something.

1381
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,040
He ran away.

1382
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,920
I can't do a melee build yet!

1383
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,790
I can't do it yet!

1384
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,390
I don't...

1385
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,130
I need a...

1386
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,670
I'm too weak!

1387
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,910
If I get close, I get shot at by 20 people!

1388
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,350
I'm too weak right now!

1389
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,270
That was a skill issue.

1390
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,690
Not enough insurance.

1391
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,410
I need more!

1392
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,110
10 is not enough!

1393
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,770
I need like 50!

1394
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,350
Holy shit, this loading screen!

1395
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:43,090
Fallout 4, please!

1396
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,110
I heard that you can mod it in a way that reduces the loading time.

1397
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:47,850
Is that true?

1398
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,650
All I hear is wah, wah, wah.

1399
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,010
Just skill issue.

1400
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,770
The world needs more.

1401
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,650
We need more.

1402
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,130
Oh my god.

1403
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,190
There is?

1404
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,210
Okay, we're gonna figure this out next time.

1405
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,790
Because I can't.

1406
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,410
Holy shit, that takes fucking forever.

1407
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,070
Am I going the right way to saving him?

1408
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,490
Like, where is he?

1409
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,390
It says here.

1410
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,410
Bye Nick.

1411
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,830
Is Nick here?

1412
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:27,850
I'm not nothing.

1413
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:39,200
Oh god, oh god, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, while I fucking eat.

1414
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,560
Go Cosworth, I need to find food that gives me the most... oh there you go.

1415
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,360
Purified water.

1416
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,400
Oh, there you go.

1417
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,060
Alright, go Cosworth, go.

1418
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:51,700
Over there!

1419
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,820
Oh god, oh god.

1420
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,160
Oh god.

1421
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,300
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, here, here!

1422
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,400
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit!

1423
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,920
Guys, I think it's a bad idea that I'm in the open, guys.

1424
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:07,680
Like...

1425
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,320
Guys, I think... I don't think I should be in the open, everybody.

1426
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,220
Yeah!

1427
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,980
I'm having a lot of fun!

1428
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:23,600
No!

1429
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,670
Holy shit!

1430
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,530
Oh my god.

1431
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,070
He's actually doing something.

1432
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:40,750
I'm gonna run.

1433
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,030
There's no way he can shoot me.

1434
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,950
Okay.

1435
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:45,850
Head, head, head, head.

1436
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,110
There's... I have to hit it.

1437
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:47,530
Nope.

1438
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,010
Almost.

1439
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,250
No, almost there.

1440
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:49,690
Nope!

1441
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:49,950
Oh!

1442
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:50,390
Nope!

1443
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,610
That 20% should not have taken that 20% bet.

1444
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:54,930
It's okay.

1445
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,530
I can shoot it myself, I guess.

1446
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,490
Guys, guys, okay.

1447
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,700
I did it.

1448
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,420
Guys, I should not have taken that 20% bet.

1449
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,580
Yeah, it's...

1450
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,440
The 20% bet was not in my favor.

1451
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,740
Maybe I'm faster than a bullet.

1452
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,800
You guys don't know that.

1453
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,600
I did it.

1454
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,300
Okay.

1455
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,780
Fine!

1456
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,000
I'll play first person!

1457
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:38,700
Fine!

1458
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,220
Alright, what's in Vault 114?

1459
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,620
Yay!

1460
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,720
Yeah, it's me.

1461
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,240
That's me.

1462
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,180
A good person?

1463
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:02,980
Oh!

1464
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,660
Nice.

1465
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,300
We're okay.

1466
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,520
Oh my god!

1467
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,100
He has a bat!

1468
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,780
He's going full melee!

1469
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,680
Braver than me.

1470
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,180
He truly is braver than me.

1471
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,100
Okay, I should stop taking people's clothes.

1472
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,780
I really should.

1473
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,360
But I can't help it.

1474
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,500
Oh, he has potato crisp!

1475
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:24,840
Alright.

1476
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,580
Guys, I restrained myself from taking his clothes, guys.

1477
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,520
Guys, I did it.

1478
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,420
Guys, are you proud of me?

1479
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,140
I didn't... I didn't take his clothes, guys.

1480
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,040
I actually did it.

1481
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,980
Alright, gotta eat some bubble gum.

1482
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,500
Maybe a corn.

1483
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,540
Maybe some cram.

1484
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,640
There you go.

1485
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,120
I'll take the vegetable starch, though.

1486
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,880
There's a sliding door.

1487
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,100
Oh, I can open the door!

1488
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,680
Open.

1489
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,300
I did it, guys!

1490
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,160
I let him have his clothes on!

1491
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,980
Ooh, purified water.

1492
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,620
We need that.

1493
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:00,980
Hello?

1494
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,860
Is anybody here?

1495
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,720
I'm a good person!

1496
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,120
Hello?

1497
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,140
Nick?

1498
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,320
So I got a question.

1499
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,200
Why the hell would anyone build a vault out of a subway station?

1500
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,820
This place is like the opposite of a gas station.

1501
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,200
Oh!

1502
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,620
Did people like mutate it?

1503
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,780
That's a ghoul!

1504
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,320
Oh!

1505
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,820
They weren't planning on using it?

1506
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,120
I thought it was like a way to like...

1507
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,440
I thought it was like a way...

1508
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,140
Okay, that's that.

1509
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,860
I'm gonna take my gacha.

1510
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,700
I know it's gonna work.

1511
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,060
I knew it!

1512
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,220
It hit, guys!

1513
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:50,640
Oh!

1514
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,640
Oh my god, 100 crit!

1515
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,560
Oh!

1516
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,880
My gacha was good today.

1517
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,740
My gacha was good to me.

1518
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,460
There, nice.

1519
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,320
I don't have to...

1520
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:04,980
Oh shit, okay.

1521
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:05,840
Wait!

1522
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,840
Did you see that?

1523
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,740
That's a better gun!

1524
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,940
Glow-sided hair trigger.

1525
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,160
Oh my god!

1526
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,120
It's radioactive!

1527
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,460
It's radioactive!

1528
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,100
Instant mash, 10 mm pistols.

1529
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,060
No, I'm carrying too much again!

1530
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,080
I have a problem!

1531
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,760
I have a hoarder problem!

1532
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:25,860
I...

1533
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,920
I have a problem!

1534
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,640
There we go.

1535
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,720
We got this.

1536
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,320
I should eat to aid.

1537
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,380
I'll eat some...

1538
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,440
I'll eat some...

1539
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,560
You know what?

1540
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,680
I'll eat some instant mash.

1541
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,120
And some dog meat.

1542
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,580
I'll find a right away later.

1543
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,220
Right?

1544
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,960
I'm gonna find right away.

1545
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,200
Wait, what the fuck?

1546
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,000
Peek me!

1547
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,760
Wait, if I go closer...

1548
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,180
I have faster fingers!

1549
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,880
Oh shit!

1550
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,040
That wasn't it.

1551
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,220
That wasn't it.

1552
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:13,620
Sorry.

1553
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,360
I thought I could like out-shoot him.

1554
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,280
No!

1555
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,780
Every time!

1556
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,040
Every fucking time!

1557
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,580
I keep taking more and more stuff!

1558
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,920
Okay, we gotta drop this.

1559
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,620
We gotta drop all these machine guns.

1560
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,240
Okay, here we go.

1561
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,500
I should be fine now.

1562
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,880
Ooh, double egg!

1563
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,480
So...

1564
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,460
Nice.

1565
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,020
Alright, it's this way.

1566
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,640
No, I need all these junk!

1567
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,220
You don't understand!

1568
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,620
You don't understand, dragons!

1569
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,220
Oh shit!

1570
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,720
The fastest fingers!

1571
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,220
Oh my god, they have an oven mitt!

1572
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,180
Hello?

1573
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,120
No, you don't.

1574
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,420
Oh wait, duct tape.

1575
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,060
Ball peen hammer?

1576
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,820
What's that?

1577
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,060
Shock glass, whiskey...

1578
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,580
Pre-war money?

1579
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,700
What can I do with pre-war money?

1580
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,180
We'll drop them off at our settlement later after we find Nick.

1581
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,820
Who's that?

1582
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,450
Who's that over here?

1583
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,610
I hear somebody!

1584
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,610
I hear somebody!

1585
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,610
I hear somebody!

1586
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:42,230
I hear somebody!

1587
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,730
Okay.

1588
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,370
I gotta loosen up.

1589
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,910
I got the fidgets.

1590
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,650
It won't look up, right?

1591
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:48,530
No!

1592
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,530
Cosworth!

1593
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,020
You bitch!

1594
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,280
Cosworth actually pushed me!

1595
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,460
Oh my god!

1596
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,540
He actually pushed me down!

1597
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,640
Oh my god, you bitch!

1598
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,740
Okay, I know Nick Valentine.

1599
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,000
He has...

1600
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,320
He has...

1601
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,420
Oh no, I'm fucking in Coomberwood again.

1602
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:16,940
No!

1603
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,320
Oh my god, look at my collection of guns here!

1604
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,140
Alright, nice.

1605
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,420
I'm gonna not take that submachine gun.

1606
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,820
Alright, this should be it, right?

1607
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,420
I found you?

1608
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,460
I found him?

1609
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,160
I found him?

1610
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,980
The circuit rush kicked in.

1611
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,540
I know he can carry my stuff.

1612
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,840
I gave him all my stuff now.

1613
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,820
So he has everything.

1614
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,380
I found a loading screen.

1615
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:57,720
No!

1616
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,560
I found a loading...

1617
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,720
This is the only thing that's killing me right now.

1618
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,020
Playing Fallout 4.

1619
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,880
It's the goddamn loading screen.

1620
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:17,420
Someone fucking linked me the mod in Bird Cedars later after the stream where I could fucking at least have the time of...

1621
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,940
...of the loading screen.

1622
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,540
I can't.

1623
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,580
I actually can't.

1624
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,600
I can't take this.

1625
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,580
It's actually fucking me up, man.

1626
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:33,450
Alright.

1627
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,150
Oh!

1628
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,530
Look at the lights.

1629
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,730
The settlement needs some flashlights.

1630
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,110
Get him!

1631
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:51,350
Alright.

1632
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:52,510
No, 4%...

1633
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:52,810
You know what?

1634
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,110
I'll take the 4%.

1635
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,210
No, fuck.

1636
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,970
It's at 0% now.

1637
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:57,090
I'll be fine.

1638
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:57,870
It's just one guy.

1639
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,310
I can kill one guy.

1640
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,770
Get over here.

1641
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,310
There you go.

1642
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,390
Pew!

1643
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:07,890
Pew!

1644
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:08,570
Pew!

1645
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,930
Oh my god!

1646
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,750
I might as well shoot him myself.

1647
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,970
Oh my god!

1648
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:18,610
Bro!

1649
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,590
Like, I shot... Bro!

1650
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,010
I don't need the VAT system.

1651
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:23,770
I might as well shoot him myself.

1652
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,970
It was just... It was just faster.

1653
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:32,050
It was actually just faster.

1654
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:34,990
Hello?

1655
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,890
I don't know who you are, but we got 3 minutes.

1656
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,550
I did it.

1657
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,550
Before they realize muscles for brains ain't coming back.

1658
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,890
Get this door open!

1659
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:44,970
How do I get it open?

1660
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,590
I'm trying to.

1661
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,390
Did I not pick up the overseer?

1662
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:52,930
You're gonna hack that terminal to open up this door.

1663
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:53,670
There's a terminal?

1664
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:54,910
Oh, there you are!

1665
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,730
Oh, there's a terminal right here!

1666
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,430
I got you.

1667
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,630
I'm so good at hacking.

1668
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,090
Alright.

1669
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:01,830
Password required.

1670
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:04,450
Brains vault system.

1671
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:05,630
Oh, override.

1672
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,190
Please take a number.

1673
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:07,690
Okay.

1674
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:09,910
Please wait until your number is called.

1675
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:10,870
Have a nice day.

1676
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,530
Oh, I can override.

1677
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,390
Joki, the loading gets better if you turn off the V-Sync.

1678
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,110
Thank you in the super chat.

1679
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:16,610
Thank you.

1680
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,730
Did I turn off V-Sync?

1681
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:19,450
I don't know.

1682
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:21,530
Okay.

1683
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,090
I did.

1684
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,250
Opening door.

1685
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:24,970
Nice.

1686
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,610
Okay.

1687
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,610
I did it!

1688
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,290
Hello?

1689
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,500
You're the one that everybody likes.

1690
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:35,630
I don't understand.

1691
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,570
I'm trying to track a murderer.

1692
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,090
Yeah!

1693
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:04,010
I don't usually go after blood money, but I guess I can make an exception.

1694
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:06,210
I've been cooped up in here for weeks.

1695
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:10,190
Turns out the runaway daughter I came here to find wasn't kidnapped.

1696
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,010
She's Skinny Malone's new flame.

1697
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,070
Oh!

1698
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,930
He got baited.

1699
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,490
Anyway, you got troubles and I'm glad to help.

1700
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,270
But now ain't the time.

1701
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,350
Let's blow this joint.

1702
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,450
Then we'll talk.

1703
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:24,910
Is he going to be my new companion?

1704
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:27,790
There we go.

1705
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:28,370
Oh!

1706
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,350
I'll take it.

1707
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:33,010
Malone's crew here used to be small time.

1708
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,290
Muscled out of the old...

1709
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:36,510
What's this?

1710
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,390
Welcome, employees.

1711
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:41,010
I hope this mistress find you well and you move into your new position.

1712
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:44,790
Your appointment as Overshare came with high recommendation from our interviewers.

1713
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,150
Please do not be nervous.

1714
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:48,610
Oh, that's it?

1715
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:49,350
Okay.

1716
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,550
...by bigger players.

1717
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:52,210
That's it.

1718
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,170
I want to take these.

1719
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,430
...to the previous owners, but they're not exactly around the job.

1720
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:58,050
Oh, I take these.

1721
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,710
Please, please, please!

1722
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:04,070
Can we just run back to town?

1723
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:07,450
Do I...?

1724
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,770
Do I have to follow him?

1725
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,330
Can I just...

1726
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,430
...fast travel back to Diamond City?

1727
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,370
Hold

1728
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:19,680
up.

1729
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,780
I hear some of them coming.

1730
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,140
There they are.

1731
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:22,800
Where?

1732
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,120
How do you wanna play this?

1733
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,260
Shoot him... Nick.

1734
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,580
Let's keep moving.

1735
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,180
We'll talk once we're out.

1736
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:30,980
Nek, Dino!

1737
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,740
Shoot him!

1738
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:34,800
I'm ready to shoot him!

1739
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,140
Wait, listen to the tapes?

1740
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,620
Which tape did I grab?

1741
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,780
I move so fast, I never...

1742
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,820
I don't know.

1743
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,180
Muns, ammo, junk...

1744
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,160
Where is it?

1745
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,360
Was it this one?

1746
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,340
Was it 21?

1747
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,460
Or...

1748
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,960
21 or 103?

1749
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:09,960
21?

1750
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:26,770
Are you just gonna walk back?

1751
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,930
There you

1752
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,920
go.

1753
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,460
Red Axe!

1754
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,300
Oh my god, they just stopped her interview.

1755
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,680
Yeah, she just started!

1756
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,680
She talked too much.

1757
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,320
They don't like it.

1758
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,520
They don't like it when they talk too much.

1759
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,680
They just wanna be obedient.

1760
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:34,860
Oh!

1761
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:35,840
Food!

1762
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,820
I always need more food.

1763
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,180
Yeah, they're not looking for someone competent.

1764
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,380
They're looking for people like me.

1765
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,340
She... he can...

1766
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,840
Hell of a lot easier to do.

1767
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,700
Wait, he can hack!

1768
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,880
Oh my god, he can hack!

1769
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,640
He's already better than Cogsworth.

1770
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,480
I need these wrenches.

1771
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,220
I don't know what I'm gonna do with them, but I know I need it.

1772
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,200
There's a nursery?

1773
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:06,460
Me?

1774
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,280
It's me!

1775
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:12,440
Doki!

1776
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:13,840
Oh,

1777
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,520
I need these.

1778
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,140
I don't know what I'm gonna do with it, but I need them.

1779
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:22,960
Shoot him!

1780
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,700
Just shoot him!

1781
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,400
Oh, I need that too.

1782
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,780
And I need that.

1783
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:31,880
And I need that.

1784
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,100
Oh, I definitely need this.

1785
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,840
It's a comic book.

1786
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,720
Cogsworth is useless.

1787
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,640
Oh, it's this way.

1788
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:37,900
Okay.

1789
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:39,620
Uh...

1790
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:41,940
This way?

1791
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:42,840
Yeah!

1792
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,280
Oh, no, no, not this way.

1793
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,180
Oh.

1794
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,260
Like this?

1795
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:47,260
No!

1796
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,400
My bobby pin!

1797
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,280
It's okay, I have a lot.

1798
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,460
I have a lot.

1799
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:51,700
No.

1800
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:52,820
Oh.

1801
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,820
Should be like here.

1802
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:55,240
No.

1803
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:56,840
Like this?

1804
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,740
I know we're in the middle of a gunfight right now, but I need to figure this out.

1805
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:01,380
Yes.

1806
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:01,800
Yay!

1807
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,740
What is that?

1808
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,340
Soap?

1809
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,200
Oh, it's soap.

1810
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,780
Look at all this soap!

1811
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:07,960
And melons!

1812
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,620
And beer!

1813
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,720
Oh my god!

1814
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,160
The settlement needs...

1815
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,600
The settlement needs...

1816
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,300
Needs...

1817
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,260
Needs a broom.

1818
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:22,800
Oh, I need a broom.

1819
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:23,680
My bread!

1820
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,760
All right, I can eat now!

1821
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,020
Let's see.

1822
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,180
I picked up so much food!

1823
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,400
I must be able to eat now.

1824
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,280
All right, I can get...

1825
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,760
Oh, but that's two rads!

1826
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,060
Is there anything that gives me a lot?

1827
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:36,960
Purified water?

1828
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,640
I guess I'll take the purified water.

1829
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,080
Oh, wait!

1830
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,660
I'm still...

1831
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,160
I forgot to do the one thing!

1832
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,460
It's okay.

1833
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,440
Uh, I mean, I don't need seven hats, I guess.

1834
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:48,940
Do I?

1835
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:49,060
What?

1836
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,400
Do I...

1837
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,760
Guys, I guess I don't need seven fedoras.

1838
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,260
I guess.

1839
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,020
Alright, here we go.

1840
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,220
I should have enough right.

1841
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:07,960
Here we go.

1842
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:08,560
What's that?

1843
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,240
Iguana on a stick?

1844
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,900
Oh, he has a black baseball bat though.

1845
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,200
Will he be fine?

1846
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,460
Can Nick Valentine die?

1847
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,820
Not that it's an option.

1848
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,580
He'll be fine, right?

1849
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,880
Oh, I need an empty can.

1850
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:23,460
No!

1851
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,880
But I need all of this!

1852
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,340
If only you could wear all six.

1853
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,560
Okay, I guess I don't need this.

1854
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,140
I guess I don't need six suits.

1855
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,880
I guess.

1856
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,740
Wait, I need one of these for armor.

1857
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,280
Okay, I don't need the left arm.

1858
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:41,960
I'm too lazy.

1859
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,840
What's that?

1860
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:44,860
Wonder glue?

1861
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,740
Oh my god, we always need glue.

1862
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:52,980
Oh shit.

1863
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,240
There you go.

1864
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,840
I honestly don't know if they actually have...

1865
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,020
Oh my god!

1866
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:02,780
A melon?

1867
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,080
I need a melon!

1868
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,100
A pillow!

1869
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,660
The settlement needs more pillows!

1870
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,100
Oh my god, I need all these plates.

1871
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,400
Guys, you don't understand.

1872
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,820
These plates are so annoying.

1873
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,500
They're so important.

1874
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,920
You don't understand, guys.

1875
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,540
They're so important.

1876
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,240
Alright, I can get rid of like...

1877
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,720
I'll get... Okay, fine.

1878
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,520
I'll get rid of like...

1879
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,640
I'll get rid of the plates, okay?

1880
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,040
I'll get rid of the plates.

1881
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,540
But I'm keeping the pillow.

1882
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,620
I don't have a problem!

1883
01:11:59,020 --> 01:11:59,260
I don't have a problem!

1884
01:11:59,260 --> 01:11:59,320
I don't have a problem!

1885
01:11:59,320 --> 01:11:59,880
They're important!

1886
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,200
Oh my god, we need...

1887
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,100
I was busy looking at the cigarette!

1888
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:11,560
Did you hear the Lord drop the husband being a war criminal?

1889
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:11,960
Did you hear the Lord drop the husband being a war criminal?

1890
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,320
Jim, thank you for the super chat.

1891
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:13,640
Thank you.

1892
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,780
Well, I know he was in the war.

1893
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,300
I didn't realize he was a war criminal.

1894
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,420
Okay, I'll eat the melon.

1895
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:20,420
I'll eat it.

1896
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,160
And I guess I'll eat the...

1897
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,520
I'll just have profile water.

1898
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,360
It's okay.

1899
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,380
He can't die, right?

1900
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:32,190
Okay.

1901
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,010
Whoa, he's so tanky!

1902
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,370
There you go.

1903
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:38,970
Alright, bottle cap.

1904
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:42,090
And then I'll grab the bottle cap.

1905
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,590
And then the rounds.

1906
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:45,690
Oh my god, can I steal the bike?

1907
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,830
Guys, I don't... I swear...

1908
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,710
The toy car!

1909
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:51,730
A toy truck before my toy car!

1910
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,850
The toy car!

1911
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:57,740
Guys!

1912
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,440
I need all of this!

1913
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,280
What else do they have?

1914
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,900
A Vault-Tec lab coat?

1915
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,720
Wait, you can't romance Nick Valentine?

1916
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:15,700
I thought you could.

1917
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,560
Then why the fuck is everybody freaking out about Nick Valentine?

1918
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,000
Nick Valentine...

1919
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,900
I don't have a problem!

1920
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,920
Oh my god!

1921
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,320
A Vault-Tec...

1922
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,100
...jumpsuit!

1923
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,760
We need that.

1924
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,920
Look at these lights.

1925
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:36,900
I can't do...

1926
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,660
It's okay.

1927
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,540
It'll be fine.

1928
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,790
Alright, it's fine.

1929
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,090
Iguana stick?

1930
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:49,710
What the fuck is an iguana stick?

1931
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,810
Oh, I guess it... Oh, it's a Oh, it's an iguana on a stick.

1932
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,650
I know what an iguana stick is now.

1933
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:56,930
Alright guys, I'm gonna eat a little bit.

1934
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,170
Let's see, and then...

1935
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,570
We'll eat the fruit.

1936
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:01,770
Guys, it's okay.

1937
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:02,710
Just a little bit of it.

1938
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,790
I should get rid of some stuff.

1939
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,130
No!

1940
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,230
But what about my...

1941
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,710
Okay, maybe I don't need all of that.

1942
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,590
Fine, I'll get rid of this.

1943
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,370
Open the door, Nick.

1944
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,300
Open it.

1945
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,320
Where did he go?

1946
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,800
Oh, he went outside.

1947
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,720
He disappeared!

1948
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,200
Where did he go?

1949
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,800
You save those fruits for your settlement?

1950
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,220
They don't need it!

1951
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:44,520
What is gonna happen to my settlement?

1952
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,320
They'll die?

1953
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,860
They'll starve?

1954
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,520
There's no way.

1955
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,060
Thank you for the super chat.

1956
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:51,420
Thank you.

1957
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:55,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1958
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,580
They'll be fine.

1959
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,720
They'll just need more plates.

1960
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,360
Guys, it'll be fine.

1961
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,300
I'll just give them plates.

1962
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,660
They can just grow more.

1963
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,520
Exactly.

1964
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,440
I don't need those fruits.

1965
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,700
Wait, they can leave?

1966
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,660
They'll leave my settlement?

1967
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,660
You mean I actually have to care?

1968
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,960
Wait, how much fruits do I have left?

1969
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,700
Do I still have fruits?

1970
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:23,740
Do I still have fruits?

1971
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,580
I still have fruits.

1972
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,560
I still have the...

1973
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,880
the muti-fruits and the double eggs.

1974
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,000
Guys, I still have fruits.

1975
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,420
How much this is gonna set me back?

1976
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,460
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for your two timing game, Skinny.

1977
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,980
You oughta tell her to write home more often.

1978
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:39,420
You oughta tell her to write home more often.

1979
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,780
Oh, poor little Valentine.

1980
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:42,980
Oh, poor little Valentine.

1981
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,160
Ashamed you got beat up by a girl?

1982
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:48,020
I'll just run back home to Daddy.

1983
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:48,600
I'll just run back home to Daddy.

1984
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,660
They can't be planted?

1985
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:49,820
That's it?

1986
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,520
I'm gonna kill him.

1987
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,180
Oh no guys.

1988
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,880
Wait, I have a nade, right?

1989
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,600
I do.

1990
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,740
I should have a nade.

1991
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,580
I've hoarded so much, I must have one nade.

1992
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,720
Oh nice, I do.

1993
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:08,900
Alright.

1994
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,280
How do I take my nade out?

1995
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,940
Guys, how do I take my nade out?

1996
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,960
You can just look at it.

1997
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,740
Is it G?

1998
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,460
Oh, it's M4.

1999
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,640
Encourage violence.

2000
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,540
Wait, what's going on for her?

2001
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,620
I actually wanna know the lore.

2002
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:52,420
Turns out she skipped town to be with my old pal Skinny Malone.

2003
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:53,860
Mob boss.

2004
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:58,700
Never thought he'd manage to scrape together a big enough crew to take over a vault.

2005
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,580
Guess life's full of surprises.

2006
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,240
Hey, who's running this show here?

2007
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,760
You got something to say?

2008
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,720
Say it to me.

2009
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,820
Darla's the problem.

2010
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:15,020
Listen to me, I'm hotter than her.

2011
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,560
Look at yourself.

2012
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,080
Darla is playing you for a sap.

2013
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,780
I have red hair.

2014
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:21,460
You're better than her.

2015
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,780
You're right.

2016
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,080
Oh my god, I'm right!

2017
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,940
She walked into my life.

2018
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,120
What are you talking about?

2019
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:29,960
I knew it, killer!

2020
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,160
She's saying you're dragging me and this whole operation down a bad road.

2021
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:34,780
I told you.

2022
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,580
I told you.

2023
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,520
It's true.

2024
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:37,880
I told you.

2025
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,580
It works because I'm a woman.

2026
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,900
I'm a real female.

2027
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,680
Fat ass.

2028
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,140
They always gotta hit you where it hurts.

2029
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,440
Now what am I gonna do about you two?

2030
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:52,100
Skinny Malone is not skinny.

2031
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,220
That sucks, bro.

2032
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,540
I still see your ugly faces after that.

2033
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,080
I'm gonna start shooting until there ain't no more bullets left in this whole vault.

2034
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,160
We better get out of here fast.

2035
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,600
I fucking did it.

2036
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,580
I knew it.

2037
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:05,540
Two.

2038
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,960
Oh shit!

2039
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:07,780
Oh, he's counting!

2040
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:08,800
He knows how to count!

2041
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,500
Where do I go?

2042
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,860
I go here?

2043
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,040
Valentine!

2044
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:19,840
Where do I go?

2045
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:20,580
Wait, where did he go?

2046
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,500
Why is he taking you forever?

2047
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,100
Kongsworth, why are you over there?

2048
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:33,340
Don't worry.

2049
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,680
No, I did call.

2050
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,080
He has all my inventory right now.

2051
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,340
Are you gonna leave?

2052
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,800
I'll leave first.

2053
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,860
I didn't know which exit they're gonna take.

2054
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:52,100
There's so many exits.

2055
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,320
It's okay.

2056
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,680
I have Nick Valentine now.

2057
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,280
I have to actually work on my settlement?

2058
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,420
This is such a scam.

2059
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,760
Why can't it be automated?

2060
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,040
I don't understand.

2061
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,260
Why do I have to work on the settlement?

2062
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,740
Is that fair?

2063
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,180
Just let them leave.

2064
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,780
Well, baby.

2065
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,640
If it's me having a fucking house...

2066
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,780
I have to work for it.

2067
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,760
It's so cruel.

2068
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,000
Where is the...

2069
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,700
Dragoons at the sanctuary.

2070
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,860
Where is the food?

2071
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,460
I don't know, Dragoons.

2072
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,420
Where is the food?

2073
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,320
I don't know, Dragoons.

2074
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:51,320
Where is the food?

2075
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,900
I'm eating all the fucking red roach meat.

2076
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,180
Get your own food, Dragoons.

2077
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,560
Farm your own food.

2078
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,140
Why are you depending on me?

2079
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,240
I barely can take care of myself.

2080
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,820
Oh my god.

2081
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,580
It's still loading.

2082
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:09,520
Oh my god.

2083
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:09,920
Please.

2084
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:15,200
Somebody link me that mod so I can patch it later before part 3.

2085
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,860
50% of this playthrough is just loading screens.

2086
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,820
Three years later.

2087
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,960
Wait, are Cogsworth and Nick the same voice actor?

2088
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,320
Wait, they're really the same?

2089
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,420
I didn't realize.

2090
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,820
We're going to die.

2091
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,600
Just eat the egg goons.

2092
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,560
Just make them the food.

2093
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,700
We have the tomato goons and the egg goons.

2094
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:41,700
Just eat them.

2095
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,680
It's fresh meat.

2096
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,660
That's why survival of the fittest.

2097
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,400
It just works.

2098
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:50,520
It just works.

2099
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,120
The loading screen simulator.

2100
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,140
Doki, please.

2101
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,960
We're so hungry.

2102
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,080
Look at the dragons.

2103
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:01,680
It's fine.

2104
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,120
Calibism is fine.

2105
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,760
If it's for survival.

2106
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:15,050
I don't have enough space in my SSD.

2107
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:18,690
My SSD only has the important games.

2108
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,650
Like Apex and Overwatch.

2109
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,400
Father, please.

2110
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,220
It's time.

2111
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,440
Do I need to start praying to time?

2112
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,600
Oh, holy time.

2113
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,480
Please let me play the game.

2114
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,780
All I want to do is go to Diamond City.

2115
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,840
So I can make Nick my companion.

2116
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:51,000
Because I'm pretty sure he's a better companion than Cogsworth.

2117
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,240
Please.

2118
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,740
That's all I want.

2119
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,980
I spent the majority of this game in this black screen.

2120
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:06,820
Time.

2121
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,120
Oh, thank God.

2122
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,100
Can I turn Vsync off here?

2123
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,460
All right.

2124
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:13,180
Vibration.

2125
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,540
I don't think that's Vsync.

2126
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,800
No, I cannot.

2127
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:17,460
All right.

2128
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,160
I guess we suffer.

2129
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,700
All right.

2130
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:20,980
I'm going to play the game.

2131
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,780
Where do we go?

2132
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,180
Where do we go now?

2133
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:31,920
Ellie.

2134
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,600
She sent me.

2135
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,960
My son.

2136
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:52,820
Oh, okay.

2137
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,080
I'll meet you there.

2138
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:54,620
I'll meet you there.

2139
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,040
Yeah.

2140
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,140
I'll see you in Diamond City.

2141
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:57,540
Yeah.

2142
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,440
I saved Valentine.

2143
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:00,560
Yeah.

2144
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:01,840
I did it.

2145
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:02,660
Okay.

2146
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,700
We're going to...

2147
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,300
Oh, I leveled up.

2148
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,000
Hey.

2149
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,400
I leveled up.

2150
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,420
All right, guys.

2151
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:09,760
I need more luck apparently.

2152
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:10,800
Right?

2153
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,900
I need more luck.

2154
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,000
All right.

2155
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,300
I need like five luck.

2156
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,940
I have three luck now.

2157
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:17,320
Nice.

2158
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:17,700
Okay.

2159
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:18,400
All right.

2160
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,180
We're going to travel to...

2161
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:20,960
I'm going to go to the next one.

2162
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,700
Our sanctuary so we can like throw some shit away.

2163
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,360
Where's my house?

2164
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:26,960
Here?

2165
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:27,840
Oh, sanctuary.

2166
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,240
Oh, they're 24% happy.

2167
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,400
Look, they did it.

2168
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:32,660
All right.

2169
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:33,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2170
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:33,740
Thank you.

2171
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:34,440
Thank you.

2172
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,340
Doki has such a huge muscle.

2173
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,020
Why not run?

2174
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,680
Use melee weapons or punch.

2175
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:39,440
Thank you for the super chat.

2176
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:39,740
Thank you.

2177
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:40,380
Thank you.

2178
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,740
All right.

2179
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:45,180
Well, you see, we tried that and then I got shot by 20 people.

2180
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,780
So I realized I shouldn't try that.

2181
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:48,900
All right.

2182
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,420
All right.

2183
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,060
All right.

2184
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:50,240
All right.

2185
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:57,140
After getting shot by 20 people, it was just not it.

2186
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,420
It was not it.

2187
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,700
All right.

2188
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,240
Nice.

2189
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:01,760
Okay.

2190
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:04,780
Now that I threw all of that away.

2191
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,700
Where's Cogsworth?

2192
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,480
Cogsworth, I know you have items.

2193
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:09,840
Trade.

2194
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:10,340
Okay.

2195
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,040
Give me back all...

2196
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:12,800
Yes.

2197
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,040
I'll take it all up.

2198
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,940
And then I'm going to transfer.

2199
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,940
And then I'm going to go to the next one.

2200
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,540
I'm going to press store all junk.

2201
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:23,960
And...

2202
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:24,960
Yeah.

2203
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,400
I dumped all the junk.

2204
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,640
That's the junk, right?

2205
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,600
I did it.

2206
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:31,000
Okay.

2207
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,900
Cogsworth, I need to transfer some stuff.

2208
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,040
Wait there.

2209
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:36,960
Okay.

2210
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,080
And then I'm going to throw some stuff away.

2211
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,140
You know what?

2212
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:43,580
Just take some...

2213
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:44,700
Just take...

2214
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,220
Do you know what?

2215
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:45,680
Fuck it.

2216
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,440
Just take this.

2217
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:47,540
Wait.

2218
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:47,760
No.

2219
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:48,060
No.

2220
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:48,680
Don't take that.

2221
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:49,780
Take...

2222
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:50,940
I don't know.

2223
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,160
I don't need all these fusion cells.

2224
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,640
What are the fusion cells for?

2225
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:54,880
Anyway.

2226
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:55,240
Okay.

2227
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,300
We're going to put the heavy stuff.

2228
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,400
Uh...

2229
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,800
Let's see.

2230
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,720
Wait 20.

2231
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,780
Oh my God.

2232
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:01,940
No.

2233
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:02,580
Take these.

2234
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,520
What the fuck am I talking about?

2235
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,800
Take all of that.

2236
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,400
That's way too much inventory.

2237
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:09,760
Uh...

2238
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:11,940
Uh...

2239
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,100
And then I'll throw away...

2240
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,220
I'll keep all of these for now.

2241
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,360
I'm going to start selling stuff.

2242
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,540
Oh, it's ammo?

2243
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:20,940
Oh, it's ammo?

2244
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,800
Oh.

2245
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:22,720
Okay.

2246
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,300
Can I build stuff now?

2247
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,320
Okay, guys.

2248
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,300
We're going to figure this out.

2249
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,160
Okay.

2250
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,460
We're going to move this.

2251
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:30,800
How do I move this?

2252
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:33,460
No.

2253
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:34,180
That's not it.

2254
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,640
How do I move you?

2255
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,580
Um...

2256
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:41,320
Select.

2257
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,320
Oh.

2258
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:42,700
Oh.

2259
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,000
Whoa.

2260
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:43,680
Whoa.

2261
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:43,820
Whoa.

2262
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:44,060
Whoa.

2263
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:44,200
Whoa.

2264
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:44,380
Whoa.

2265
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:44,500
Whoa.

2266
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:44,560
Whoa.

2267
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:44,620
Whoa.

2268
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:44,700
Whoa.

2269
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:44,820
Whoa.

2270
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:44,900
Whoa.

2271
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:44,980
Whoa.

2272
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:45,540
Whoa.

2273
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:45,600
Whoa.

2274
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,260
Okay.

2275
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,560
And then...

2276
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,560
And then I'll put you here.

2277
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:57,880
And then we put you here.

2278
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,260
Attach wires.

2279
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,480
Wait.

2280
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,800
Can I attach it to the water pipe?

2281
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,320
Does the water pipe need water...

2282
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,040
Need electricity?

2283
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,480
That's stupid, Dookie.

2284
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,360
Why did you say that?

2285
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,000
D.

2286
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,780
Are you...

2287
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,000
Is the D on now?

2288
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:17,980
Is it...

2289
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:18,620
Is the D...

2290
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,000
Oh, the D lights up!

2291
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:23,270
The dark light is on!

2292
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,470
Oh, my God!

2293
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,790
The D lights up!

2294
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:26,970
It lights up!

2295
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,090
It lights up!

2296
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:29,970
I did it!

2297
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:30,990
Right?

2298
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:34,310
Right?

2299
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,330
I can't tell.

2300
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,630
Is there another thing to hold the wire?

2301
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:41,170
How would I...

2302
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:42,450
Oh.

2303
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:43,390
I did it.

2304
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,090
Yay!

2305
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,450
I did it!

2306
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:47,590
Oh, my God.

2307
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:48,870
I'm so good at this.

2308
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:49,530
All right.

2309
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:50,350
Now we need food.

2310
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:52,110
Guys.

2311
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,250
I'm so hungry.

2312
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:54,350
We need food now.

2313
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:54,790
Resources.

2314
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:56,090
Okay.

2315
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:56,570
Food.

2316
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,170
Wait.

2317
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,150
I have carrots!

2318
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,070
I can...

2319
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,530
I can give them carrots!

2320
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:04,770
And corn!

2321
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,510
Oh, my God.

2322
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:08,530
This is it.

2323
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:09,930
I have...

2324
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:13,910
Okay.

2325
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:14,930
Good.

2326
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:16,290
Guys!

2327
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:17,730
I'm feeding my...

2328
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,780
I'm doing it!

2329
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,820
I knew it!

2330
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,180
I knew I could feed them!

2331
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,880
I'm doing it!

2332
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:29,920
I'm doing it!

2333
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,660
Oh, my God.

2334
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,760
I fucking knew it!

2335
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,180
I knew I could feed them!

2336
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,720
You guys didn't believe me at first.

2337
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:41,080
It was like, oh, Doki.

2338
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,080
Your people are going to fucking starve.

2339
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,660
I was like, no.

2340
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:45,780
No, they're not.

2341
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,060
They'll be fine.

2342
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:50,840
There's no way they can starve under my rule.

2343
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:51,960
Okay.

2344
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,080
And then...

2345
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:54,360
Uh...

2346
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,200
And I have...

2347
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:55,820
I have grain!

2348
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,520
They're going to be so wealthy!

2349
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:02,800
I'm fed!

2350
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:03,200
Look!

2351
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,320
We did it!

2352
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,120
Okay.

2353
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:08,560
And then water.

2354
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:09,740
Do we need more water?

2355
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,240
Why do you need more water?

2356
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:13,420
Okay.

2357
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,460
I guess we'll put two pumps.

2358
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,500
We'll put another pump here.

2359
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:17,740
Yeah.

2360
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,080
Now you guys are fine.

2361
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,320
Yeah!

2362
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,240
We have to tell people to work the food?

2363
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,040
Work on the fucking...

2364
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:26,180
Wait.

2365
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,320
No.

2366
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:26,820
They're already assigned.

2367
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:28,420
These guys are already assigned.

2368
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:29,040
Chat.

2369
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,880
They're already automatically assigned.

2370
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:32,520
Okay.

2371
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,380
I did good.

2372
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,640
I did good, guys.

2373
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,360
My people are happy now.

2374
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,400
See?

2375
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,380
My people are happy.

2376
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,540
We did it, Cogsworth!

2377
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,940
We fucking did it!

2378
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,260
All right.

2379
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,380
We can...

2380
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,400
Finally...

2381
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,040
We don't have to care anymore.

2382
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,860
Fucking finally.

2383
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,000
Yes.

2384
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,560
I do.

2385
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,180
It's okay.

2386
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,440
We have the...

2387
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:02,520
We have the...

2388
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,580
We got the minute man to defend our place.

2389
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,540
If it gets raided, at least the minute man can defend it, right?

2390
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,100
That's the point, right?

2391
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:13,900
My job here is done.

2392
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,240
Oh my god, it's the morning!

2393
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,100
I gotta sell stuff though.

2394
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,780
Who is a merchant?

2395
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,260
Yeah, I have.

2396
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:22,900
You sell?

2397
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:26,120
Yes.

2398
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,820
Oh my god, he makes ramen?

2399
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,140
Oh shit, nice.

2400
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,140
Alright, uh...

2401
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,640
I don't need any of this.

2402
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,080
Okay.

2403
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:41,700
Wait.

2404
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,200
My aid, my inventory...

2405
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,040
Wait, I wanted to sell other stuff.

2406
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,140
Oh, he only takes like...

2407
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:51,000
Oh, he only takes like, um...

2408
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,340
Oh, it's you!

2409
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,400
What do you want?

2410
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:02,880
That was me.

2411
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:06,860
Uh...

2412
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,680
What was that fight about?

2413
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:10,520
Yeah.

2414
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,980
Okay, to be fair, that was sort of obvious.

2415
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:17,300
Yeah.

2416
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:27,150
Tough situation.

2417
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,210
Everybody has problems.

2418
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:30,370
Yeah.

2419
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:33,210
Wait!

2420
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:34,070
I can do it!

2421
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,050
I'll just get money and I'll do it.

2422
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:39,010
I'm going to go back and talk to him and I want you to come with me.

2423
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:39,470
Of course!

2424
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:40,090
You saw?

2425
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:42,070
He won't take me seriously otherwise.

2426
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:44,270
I don't wanna have to really hurt him.

2427
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:45,790
I just want him to leave Darcy alone.

2428
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:46,690
Bro!

2429
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:48,450
Okay, I need money.

2430
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:49,950
You're gonna have to make it worth my while.

2431
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:50,190
Yeah.

2432
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:53,110
Well, now you've made us look like mere hired thugs!

2433
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:56,350
I mean, I can pay you, but I've only got 80 caps.

2434
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:57,250
Sorry.

2435
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:58,590
I hope it's enough.

2436
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:01,350
Alright.

2437
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:02,470
I'll help.

2438
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:04,770
Sign me up!

2439
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:07,090
It's okay, Cosworth, if you don't like it.

2440
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:10,010
I have Nick Valentine to replace you!

2441
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:14,490
Wait, why do you need me?

2442
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,370
If you were just going to talk to him...

2443
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:16,510
Yeah.

2444
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:17,730
Why do you need me along?

2445
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:20,470
I don't want to hurt Cook, but if he doesn't listen to me...

2446
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:22,150
I don't know what I might do.

2447
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,170
He won't dare act so smug when he sees you at my back.

2448
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:26,570
And then nobody has to get hurt.

2449
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:28,310
Alright.

2450
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:29,270
Let's do it.

2451
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:30,750
Are you going?

2452
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,250
Can you go there faster?

2453
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:41,520
Oh, I should have went there alone so I can just shoot him.

2454
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,100
Oh, I should have went there alone so I can just shoot him.

2455
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:44,180
Oh, I should have went there alone so I can just shoot him.

2456
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,360
Hey, scabber!

2457
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,820
Got plenty of ramen meat on the hook.

2458
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,720
Is he going to go or not?

2459
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:51,440
Will you help me talk to Cook?

2460
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,240
Get him to leave my wife alone.

2461
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:53,700
Yeah!

2462
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,380
I told you I said I'll help!

2463
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:56,980
Okay.

2464
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:58,360
I'll help you.

2465
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,020
Okay.

2466
01:31:59,240 --> 01:31:59,640
Good.

2467
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,440
Good.

2468
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,560
I'm sure Cook will back down once he sees you're with me.

2469
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:03,760
I'm sure Cook will back down once he sees you're with me.

2470
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:05,260
Oh, okay.

2471
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:05,740
Let's go.

2472
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:06,340
Okay.

2473
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,480
I'll do it alone.

2474
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:08,480
Yeah, I'll do it alone.

2475
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,520
This will work better if I talk to Cook by myself.

2476
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:12,500
I don't think so.

2477
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,560
Cook might try and talk his way out of it.

2478
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,300
And you don't know him like I do.

2479
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:15,800
No!

2480
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,900
Now I can't just shoot him!

2481
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:19,480
Oh, nice.

2482
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,060
I got $80.

2483
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:20,800
Doesn't matter anyway.

2484
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,060
It's alright.

2485
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,020
I got $80.

2486
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:27,920
So I'm fine.

2487
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,940
It's because he has eyes for his wife only.

2488
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,580
That's why my wrist doesn't work, guys.

2489
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:39,240
Guys, he's loyal to his cheating wife.

2490
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,180
Which, honestly, you deserve better, man.

2491
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:43,900
You deserve better.

2492
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,080
How would you even know that son is yours?

2493
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,100
That could be the other guy's.

2494
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,740
I don't have zero wrists!

2495
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,960
He literally has a wife!

2496
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,800
He literally has a wife.

2497
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:03,120
His eyes are only for her!

2498
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,160
Can you go faster?

2499
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,460
What if I just push him faster?

2500
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,220
No, okay.

2501
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:10,800
I fucked up.

2502
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,860
Pushing him faster makes him go even slower.

2503
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,640
Where is it?

2504
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,520
Is that the bar?

2505
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,340
Okay, that's the bar over there.

2506
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,640
It's open!

2507
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:24,760
Alright.

2508
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:25,820
I can't!

2509
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:26,720
You're in front of the door!

2510
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:30,460
Oh no, he tricked me into doing a loading screen, guys.

2511
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,920
You fucking can't.

2512
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:32,360
He tricked me.

2513
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,560
I literally can't open the door!

2514
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,060
Okay, there we go.

2515
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:44,400
He tricked me to go to the loading screen.

2516
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,780
Wait, there's more than one person here.

2517
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,380
There's Nelson.

2518
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:57,540
I'm here to watch.

2519
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,740
Don't tell me he's hired you to help lean on me.

2520
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:01,720
That's fucking right.

2521
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,800
Why do you care?

2522
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,080
That's fucking right.

2523
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,760
I should listen to what Paul has to say.

2524
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,080
You're making a mistake getting mixed up in this.

2525
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:13,700
You're making a mistake getting mixed up in this.

2526
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:14,320
Yeah, we're gonna do.

2527
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:15,380
Well, I'm listening, Paul.

2528
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,020
What do you have to say this time?

2529
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,500
Just this.

2530
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:20,960
Oh my god!

2531
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,340
He has a gun?

2532
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,980
I would have done this myself.

2533
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,600
Very bad idea.

2534
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,280
You don't want to pull a gun on me unless you...

2535
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:28,660
Shoot him!

2536
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,320
Do it!

2537
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,080
It'll be so funny!

2538
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:32,160
Do I just need to kill you?

2539
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:32,980
Is that what you're saying?

2540
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,120
Do it!

2541
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:42,040
Do it!

2542
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:42,660
Give Cook a chance.

2543
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,780
Attack Cook.

2544
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:46,800
Calm down.

2545
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,020
I just want him to shoot him.

2546
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,300
Did I just say attack Cook?

2547
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,820
Do it!

2548
01:34:58,940 --> 01:34:59,620
Do it!

2549
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:03,700
Do it!

2550
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:05,640
Do it!

2551
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,700
I already got my money, though.

2552
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:07,680
You know what?

2553
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,520
I already got my money.

2554
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,280
Do it!

2555
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:11,440
Better just shoot him, Paul.

2556
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,500
Heavens, no!

2557
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:13,560
Mr. Pepper!

2558
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,300
This is going to be a...

2559
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,800
What the fuck did I...

2560
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,180
What did I do?

2561
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,730
I did it.

2562
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,970
Cogsworth, do you still like me?

2563
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:38,090
Oh, I got water!

2564
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,210
Thanks, Cogsworth.

2565
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:42,410
Yeah, how do you feel about us?

2566
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,550
Not for the better?

2567
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,330
Why not?

2568
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,070
I don't understand.

2569
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:54,650
Yeah!

2570
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:59,470
I don't understand.

2571
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:01,510
You can head home now.

2572
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:02,330
Right then, Mom.

2573
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:03,910
You know where I'll be.

2574
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:04,130
Whoops!

2575
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:05,990
I did not mean to dismiss him.

2576
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,370
Wait, cancel.

2577
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,270
Stay with me.

2578
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:09,990
Wait, oh!

2579
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,230
Hey, how are you feeling, Paul?

2580
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:13,530
Hey, Paul.

2581
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:15,250
Hell, I gotta get out of here.

2582
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:18,250
You should too, before someone walks in here and pins this on us.

2583
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:20,990
I'm gonna rob him.

2584
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:24,110
Ooh, Cook residence, shotgun.

2585
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:25,090
Double shotgun?

2586
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:25,690
Whoa!

2587
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,210
I'm gonna take his suit too.

2588
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,630
That's a nice suit.

2589
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:29,110
Wait!

2590
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:30,430
If he's dead, I can rob him?

2591
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:32,810
Cogsworth isn't here anymore, right?

2592
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:34,950
Oh my God.

2593
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:35,850
Wait, he's not here!

2594
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,110
Over here!

2595
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:41,330
What?

2596
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,130
Wait, he cares?

2597
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,930
Don't be late.

2598
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:52,010
What?

2599
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:54,270
I just have to close it.

2600
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:56,530
Wait, you shot me?

2601
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,350
Why did he shot me?

2602
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:00,990
It's time for you to shut up and listen, Cook.

2603
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:02,390
What the hell is this?

2604
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:04,730
Wait, did Paul shoot me?

2605
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:08,570
Don't tell me he's hired you to help lean on me.

2606
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:11,770
I can't believe it!

2607
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:13,570
That's right.

2608
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:14,770
You should listen to Paul.

2609
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:16,250
He betrayed me!

2610
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:19,030
You're making a mistake getting mixed up in this.

2611
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,110
Stealing is where he draws the line.

2612
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:24,730
I can't believe it.

2613
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:25,450
Just this.

2614
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:28,790
You leave Darcy alone, starting now or else.

2615
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:32,090
He draws the line at stealing.

2616
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,370
Now that is a good thing.

2617
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:35,170
You don't want to pull a gun on me unless you intend to use it.

2618
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:36,610
You think I won't use it?

2619
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,110
Do I just need to kill you?

2620
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:38,910
Is that what you're saying?

2621
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:41,030
Okay, maybe like...

2622
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:42,930
Wait, okay.

2623
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,690
Calm down.

2624
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,250
I mean, it's his wife's fault.

2625
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:49,150
Okay, we're good.

2626
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,130
Why don't you see if Cook is going to listen?

2627
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:55,950
I'm sure at this point he's properly motivated to hear what you have to say.

2628
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:57,230
Oh, he never listens.

2629
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:58,130
Here we go.

2630
01:37:58,610 --> 01:37:59,430
Why me?

2631
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:00,590
Cut!

2632
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:02,570
Okay.

2633
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:05,210
Oh my god!

2634
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:07,110
Oh my god, now he dies?

2635
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:09,390
Wait.

2636
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:13,210
Oh my god, he dies?

2637
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:14,970
Wait, no!

2638
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:15,930
He dies?

2639
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,250
Okay, but...

2640
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:23,230
Okay, but...

2641
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,850
Okay, but...

2642
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:27,710
Okay, but...

2643
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:29,390
The timeline has changed.

2644
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:30,070
The timeline has changed.

2645
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,310
The timeline has changed.

2646
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:32,370
Okay, but...

2647
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:34,130
We're going to have a break for a while now and...

2648
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:34,850
Well...

2649
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,090
Time to take action.

2650
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:38,710
Past time.

2651
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,670
So I have an idea.

2652
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:43,930
Maybe we can help each other?

2653
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:46,430
Put this all behind us, you know?

2654
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,090
Put this all behind us, you know?

2655
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:48,870
What's the idea?

2656
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,610
What's the idea?

2657
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:52,990
Here's the deal.

2658
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:57,150
I have some other, um, businesses on the side.

2659
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:03,690
One of them is helping Nelson Latimer spend his dad's money to make him so he'll feel like a gangster.

2660
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:05,750
Nelson?

2661
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,630
Who's Nelson Latimer?

2662
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:09,070
Yeah, who's Nelson Latimer?

2663
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,290
An arrogant little pissant.

2664
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:17,870
But useful, since he has all the money in the world and likes to think of himself as a budding crime boss.

2665
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:26,610
Me and Nelson are supposed to be meeting some gentleman from Goodneighbor to exchange Nelson's cash for their chems.

2666
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:28,470
My plan is simple.

2667
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:31,250
We take the money and the chems.

2668
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:34,810
Wait, okay.

2669
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:37,090
Am I just helping the mob now?

2670
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,490
Hold on, I have some questions first.

2671
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,310
Yeah, what is it?

2672
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:43,050
Yeah, why now?

2673
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,810
Why did you screw these guys over all of a sudden?

2674
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:47,350
Oh, it isn't all of a sudden.

2675
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:51,170
Nelson's been complaining about my cut for a while now.

2676
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:54,830
He may be thinking about trying to strike out on his own.

2677
01:39:55,630 --> 01:39:59,030
I've been waiting for the right opportunity to present itself.

2678
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:00,610
I'm in here, it is.

2679
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,310
Anything else?

2680
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:03,010
I might as well.

2681
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:05,070
That's it.

2682
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:06,790
I think I've known enough.

2683
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:08,510
I'm in.

2684
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,070
You know what?

2685
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,110
This is the better timeline.

2686
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:14,110
I get more money.

2687
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:16,430
I promise you won't regret it.

2688
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:19,270
In a few hours, we're both going to be sitting here.

2689
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,930
Yeah, you know what?

2690
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:20,550
Thank God!

2691
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:23,150
This new timeline is so much better.

2692
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:24,970
I'll get money too.

2693
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:27,550
This is a better timeline.

2694
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:30,710
I'll get a business offer, guys.

2695
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:32,830
Might as well.

2696
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:38,270
I got 80 bottle caps and a business offer?

2697
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:39,070
Yeah, sure.

2698
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:39,510
Why not?

2699
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,010
Yeah, screw Paul in this timeline.

2700
01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:46,170
I got free stuff.

2701
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:49,350
Something bad went down in the old Museum of Witchcraft up near Cell.

2702
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,370
Museum of Witchcraft?

2703
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:55,250
Yeah, Paul already paid me anyway.

2704
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,370
Now I get more money.

2705
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:00,610
Exactly.

2706
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:01,750
I did it.

2707
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,370
It was a good thing.

2708
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:05,770
It was a good thing.

2709
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:07,370
Guys, I should sell my stuff.

2710
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:10,950
I should be able to sell my stuff from Rodriguez, right?

2711
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:14,230
New girl?

2712
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:15,310
Who's new girl?

2713
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:16,470
Me?

2714
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:18,490
What can I say?

2715
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:20,330
Names Arturo Rodriguez.

2716
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:22,550
If you need protection, let's talk.

2717
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:23,390
Protection?

2718
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:26,810
Okay, I want to buy I don't want to sell stuff.

2719
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:28,310
Everything hand tooled.

2720
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:29,790
Alright, nice.

2721
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:30,310
Okay.

2722
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:33,250
Guys, I don't know what I don't need.

2723
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:37,310
Okay, maybe I don't need...

2724
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:39,670
I don't need road letters.

2725
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:41,430
I don't need...

2726
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:43,130
Oh, I have so many guns.

2727
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:44,090
I have so many clothes.

2728
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:45,970
Alright, we don't need all these.

2729
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:47,670
We can sell one of that.

2730
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:49,350
Synthetic truce.

2731
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,770
Oh, I want to keep all the Voltex stuff.

2732
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:55,270
I want to sell...

2733
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:56,790
Okay, I don't need another photo book.

2734
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:58,830
I don't need...

2735
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,190
I don't need all that.

2736
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:02,630
Uhhh...

2737
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,290
What else do I not need?

2738
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:06,570
There's so many things though.

2739
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:08,990
Oh yeah, you guys said that pipe stuff are bad.

2740
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,330
So I'll sell all my pipe stuff.

2741
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:12,530
Uhhh...

2742
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:15,150
What's the jet?

2743
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,210
Oh, it slows time?

2744
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:18,990
Uhhh...

2745
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,490
I need all of these though.

2746
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:23,690
I don't need two masks.

2747
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:25,830
Switch categories?

2748
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:30,950
What do you mean?

2749
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:32,530
What do you mean?

2750
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,690
You guys all said pipe guns are terrible.

2751
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:35,810
Okay, I can sell that.

2752
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,770
I need all these grenades.

2753
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:39,950
Uhhh...

2754
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:42,210
I have so many good items.

2755
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,330
It's so hard to...

2756
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:44,710
Okay, we can...

2757
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:47,310
I think we can sell majority of our clothes.

2758
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:51,270
I admit that we don't need all of these clothes.

2759
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,830
Like...

2760
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:56,630
We can always grab more suits.

2761
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:56,790
We can always grab more suits.

2762
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:57,350
Like...

2763
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:59,430
We can always grab more of these.

2764
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:01,710
Uhhh...

2765
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:04,030
Oh, is the leather better than the...

2766
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,770
Is the leather better than the raider?

2767
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,550
No, it's not.

2768
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:08,590
So I can sell the leather ones.

2769
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:10,430
Uhhh...

2770
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:14,470
Okay, I need all the aid and stuff.

2771
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:15,130
Misc...

2772
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,630
Miscillaneous...

2773
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:18,190
Munts...

2774
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:19,390
Ammo...

2775
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:21,030
Oh my god!

2776
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,390
512?

2777
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:26,250
Okay, maybe not 512.

2778
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:28,890
I can sell like 200 of that.

2779
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:30,190
Right?

2780
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:30,570
Yeah.

2781
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:32,930
And that should be good.

2782
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:35,050
Confirm trade.

2783
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:36,970
Yay!

2784
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:40,610
So thirsty.

2785
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:40,930
The game changer!

2786
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:43,530
Doctor says I can't drink liquor no more.

2787
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:43,770
Alright.

2788
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:46,590
Well, ammo doesn't weigh anything.

2789
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:47,570
Well, it's okay.

2790
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,170
It's fine.

2791
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:49,650
It's fine, guys.

2792
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:50,190
It's fine.

2793
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:52,250
I'm so thirsty.

2794
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:52,370
I'm so thirsty.

2795
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:54,270
It's okay.

2796
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:55,110
I want money.

2797
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:58,950
I did it!

2798
01:43:59,050 --> 01:43:59,770
I'm a hero!

2799
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:04,290
I'm a hero!

2800
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:15,030
I'm a friend!

2801
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:21,110
I did it!

2802
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:21,870
Give me the money!

2803
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:23,190
Pay me.

2804
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:24,370
About my reward.

2805
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:26,990
They always gotta ruin the moment with money talk.

2806
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:27,710
Here.

2807
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:30,310
Every cap we agreed to for finding him.

2808
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,570
A little extra!

2809
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:34,030
Cause she likes me.

2810
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:38,790
Wait, the little extra is a fucking fedora that I'm gonna sell.

2811
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:41,110
One case at a time, Ellie.

2812
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:43,650
Our new friend needs our help first.

2813
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:45,630
Alright, let's get down to business.

2814
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,570
Take a seat.

2815
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:46,970
Okay.

2816
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:49,310
I can finally sit for real.

2817
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:50,690
Hahaha.

2818
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:54,350
I'm trying to find someone who's gone missing.

2819
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:56,210
The devil is in the details.

2820
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:57,990
Tell me everything you can.

2821
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:01,030
No matter how painful it might be.

2822
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:02,550
Uh...

2823
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:03,510
Uh...

2824
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:05,410
Sean.

2825
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,070
You're looking for my baby, Sean.

2826
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:09,750
He's less than a year old.

2827
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:12,530
Why would anyone take him?

2828
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,190
Welcome to Jermia Farm!

2829
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:14,830
Welcome, welcome!

2830
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:17,070
Why an infant?

2831
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:19,650
Someone would be taking on all of his care.

2832
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:21,530
And a baby needs a lot of it.

2833
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:23,030
What else can you tell me?

2834
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:25,010
Um...

2835
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,250
He killed my husband's not that important.

2836
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:29,550
You were in a vault when it happened.

2837
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:32,290
Vault 111.

2838
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:35,290
It was some kind of cryo facility.

2839
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:36,730
You were on ice, huh?

2840
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:39,570
More importantly, you were underground.

2841
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:41,050
Sealed up.

2842
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:44,630
There's a lot of obstacles to get through just to take one path.

2843
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,130
Oh, he's dead!

2844
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:46,030
I gotta move on!

2845
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,150
My husband's dead!

2846
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:49,630
My kidnaps.

2847
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:51,630
There was a man and a woman.

2848
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:59,530
They didn't say much, but I remember they called me the backup.

2849
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:01,310
So we're talking a small team.

2850
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:02,990
Professionals.

2851
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:06,770
The kind that know to keep their lips tight when they're on the job.

2852
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:10,330
Not sure what the backup means, though.

2853
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:12,690
Cogsberry, what are you doing?

2854
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,290
This isn't a random kidnapping.

2855
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:17,290
Whoever took your kid had an agenda.

2856
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:18,090
Hmm.

2857
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:19,630
It's a lot of work.

2858
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:21,790
There's a lot of groups in the Commonwealth that take people.

2859
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:25,190
Raiders, super mutants, the gunners.

2860
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:27,650
And of course there's the Institute.

2861
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:29,310
The Institute?

2862
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:33,350
So you think this Institute is responsible?

2863
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:35,610
Well, they're the boogeymen of the Commonwealth.

2864
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:38,450
Something goes wrong, everyone blames them.

2865
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:39,970
Easy to see why.

2866
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:46,070
Those early models since of theirs strip whole towns for parts, killing everything in their way.

2867
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:47,590
Wait, I wanna join the Institute!

2868
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:52,270
The Commonwealth is as good as human, but infiltrates cities and pulls strings from the shadows.

2869
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:57,930
Worst of all, no one knows why they do it, what their plan is, or where they are.

2870
01:46:58,170 --> 01:46:58,670
Not even you.

2871
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:00,710
I'm a synth myself.

2872
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:03,570
A discarded prototype, anyway.

2873
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:07,110
Wait, you're one of them.

2874
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:07,950
You're a prototype?

2875
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,430
You're a prototype?

2876
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:10,750
As far as I know.

2877
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:13,370
Never seen any other synth like myself.

2878
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:17,430
There's the older ones that are dumb as rocks and all metal.

2879
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:17,570
There's the older ones that are dumb as rocks and all metal.

2880
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:20,170
And there's the newer ones that are almost human.

2881
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,190
I'm somewhere in between.

2882
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:26,350
Yeah, like you're really- you can tell you're really, really old.

2883
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,930
Don't lie to me, Nick.

2884
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,310
You're one of them.

2885
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:31,370
They made you.

2886
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:32,990
Yeah, I've heard it all before.

2887
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:34,430
You're a freak.

2888
01:47:34,630 --> 01:47:36,230
You've got something to hide.

2889
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:36,930
Yeah, freak.

2890
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:40,650
Wait, aren't you programmed to support the Institute?

2891
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:44,070
People smart enough to build something like me are smart enough to cover their tracks.

2892
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:47,270
And arrogant enough to throw their unwanted trash.

2893
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:47,570
I'm not a freak.

2894
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:48,210
I'm a big fan of the Commonwealth.

2895
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,230
And fend for itself.

2896
01:47:51,730 --> 01:47:54,590
Either way, I need to find Sean.

2897
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:55,250
You're right.

2898
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:56,350
The speculation's getting closer...

2899
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:57,630
Don't be mean to Nick.

2900
01:47:58,010 --> 01:48:01,770
What did these kidnappers look like?

2901
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:04,310
Oh, he broke his programming?

2902
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:04,810
He broke his programming?

2903
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:06,650
He carried a gun!

2904
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,590
That eliminates like one person.

2905
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:14,670
That eliminates like one person.

2906
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:17,010
I'll never forget that voice.

2907
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,850
That's like everybody in the wasteland.

2908
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:36,310
He was bald.

2909
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,970
He had no hair just like you, Nick.

2910
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,020
Kellogg?

2911
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,060
The serial?

2912
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:56,380
Did he name himself after the serial because he saw a cereal box?

2913
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,760
It's Sean.

2914
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,740
He's 10 now.

2915
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,040
If it's another kid, it has to be Sean.

2916
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,300
There's no other children in this world.

2917
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:40,120
Who else could it be?

2918
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,760
There's no other children here.

2919
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:42,620
Who else could it be?

2920
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:42,640
There's no other children here.

2921
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:51,920
How do I make him join my team, guys?

2922
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,300
Nick, join my team.

2923
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,640
Nick, I don't care about Cox.

2924
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:58,340
Join my team.

2925
01:49:58,380 --> 01:49:58,580
Nick.

2926
01:49:58,740 --> 01:49:59,220
Nick.

2927
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:00,560
No!

2928
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,520
Join my team, Nick!

2929
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:03,520
No!

2930
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,820
I can't open the door, Nick!

2931
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,460
Oh, I finished the quest?

2932
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:17,940
Okay.

2933
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:21,940
I want Nick to join my team and replace Cogsworth.

2934
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,400
You talk to a kid when you're... She doesn't count.

2935
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,620
She's not a kid.

2936
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:37,800
Please.

2937
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:41,660
Why does it take forever to load back?

2938
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:42,820
Oh, there we go.

2939
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:43,400
Okay.

2940
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,740
I jumped a gun there.

2941
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:46,300
Alright, where do we have to go?

2942
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,320
Where do we go?

2943
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:53,080
I don't want Ellie to hear this, but I think you should know.

2944
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:58,890
Everything I dug up about bad news...

2945
01:50:58,890 --> 01:50:59,650
What do you mean by that?

2946
01:50:59,910 --> 01:51:00,970
More than just a mercenary.

2947
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:02,630
He's a professional.

2948
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:05,570
Quick, clean, thorough.

2949
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:07,490
Has no enemies.

2950
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:09,090
Because they're all dead.

2951
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:10,550
Oh, that's scary.

2952
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:11,450
Except you.

2953
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:14,190
Nine to one odds says he's our man.

2954
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:17,370
More than just you identifying his distinctions.

2955
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:18,030
He's got some distinguishing features.

2956
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:19,210
The M.O.

2957
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,490
is all him as well.

2958
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:25,830
Leading a small team to kidnap a baby and leaving one of the parents alive for later?

2959
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:29,090
Not many mercs in the Commonwealth can pull that off.

2960
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:31,890
What is it?

2961
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:32,170
No!

2962
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,330
Oh my god.

2963
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:35,690
This takes fucking forever.

2964
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:37,670
Can you run?

2965
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:39,750
Can you at least run?

2966
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:40,750
Like, please!

2967
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:44,370
How far is this place that I have to go?

2968
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:45,050
Okay.

2969
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:49,210
Where's the objective of this quest?

2970
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:51,870
It doesn't even tell me.

2971
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:56,030
Are you done talking?

2972
01:51:56,370 --> 01:51:57,650
Like, can you go a little faster?

2973
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:02,710
Please, why can't you run?

2974
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:04,150
That's all I ask of you.

2975
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:05,490
This is it?

2976
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:07,650
Keep an eye out, will you?

2977
01:52:08,110 --> 01:52:09,650
See if I can get this open.

2978
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:11,750
Oh my god.

2979
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:12,250
He's perfect.

2980
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:13,170
He can unlock doors.

2981
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:13,930
What can you do?

2982
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:13,930
What can you do?

2983
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:15,410
What can... exactly.

2984
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,250
Walk away.

2985
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:22,150
Wait, you can't unlock this?

2986
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:23,590
Oh my god!

2987
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,290
I can't do it!

2988
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:27,670
I'm not smart enough!

2989
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:30,730
We need to find a key?

2990
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:34,710
Where?

2991
01:52:46,270 --> 01:52:48,010
Can he actually jimmy the lock?

2992
01:52:48,850 --> 01:52:49,530
No, okay.

2993
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,750
Oh, that yellow one?

2994
01:52:54,930 --> 01:52:56,450
Oh my god, thank god it's in yellow.

2995
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:58,250
Oh, thank god.

2996
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,910
Okay.

2997
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:04,890
Alright, it's this one, right?

2998
01:53:04,990 --> 01:53:05,250
Yeah.

2999
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:08,010
This has to be it.

3000
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:09,070
Parkour!

3001
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,770
Alright, we gotta get a key.

3002
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:14,930
Push.

3003
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:19,520
Push.

3004
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:21,980
Goodbye, Cosworth.

3005
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:23,080
You're fucking useless.

3006
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,440
I can't wait to replace you with a better fucking robot.

3007
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,020
You're not even hot!

3008
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:34,240
That used you for eye candy.

3009
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:38,760
Wow, rude.

3010
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,160
What, you think Cosworth's hot?

3011
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:46,180
I'm running.

3012
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,900
Do you ever think maybe you could get a man's attention easier if you use soft keys on him?

3013
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,020
Whoa!

3014
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,100
And shout a little less?

3015
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:54,760
Oh my god, she doesn't need no man!

3016
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:55,840
She needs a woman.

3017
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,400
Hey, girl.

3018
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,240
She needs a woman.

3019
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:06,540
You first.

3020
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,420
What are you doing here, Piper?

3021
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,160
Nuh-uh.

3022
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,880
Not until it's in print.

3023
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:14,480
You can read all about it in the next issue.

3024
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:23,660
If you are done crowding the reception area, Miss Piper, the mayor needs to make time for more... responsible citizens.

3025
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:26,200
I was just leaving anyway.

3026
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,660
The mayor's receiving visitors as long as they aren't members of the press.

3027
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,980
Did you need help?

3028
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:34,220
I need to get Kellogg's house.

3029
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:37,980
I need to talk to someone about Kellogg's old house in the West End.

3030
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,040
I didn't like her anyway, guys.

3031
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:41,440
I didn't like her.

3032
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,080
She's just not my type.

3033
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,860
If there was something belonging to the man that you had left out...

3034
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,280
It's not that she rejected me.

3035
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,860
It's that I rejected her before she could reject me.

3036
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:54,120
I don't have time.

3037
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,020
I need that key now.

3038
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,500
Why is finding this key so important to you, honey?

3039
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:03,240
Do I have money?

3040
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:05,600
Oh, I don't want to give my money away.

3041
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:06,600
Just trust me.

3042
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:07,420
I'll throw a threat at you.

3043
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,200
Wait, I'll find my... finding my babies.

3044
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,880
All I want to do is find my baby.

3045
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:15,380
The man who owned that house.

3046
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,320
Kidnapped him.

3047
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:19,160
I've heard the sob stories before.

3048
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:20,200
So save them.

3049
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:20,520
Bitch!

3050
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,800
Can I threaten her?

3051
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:25,900
Look at me.

3052
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:27,080
I should do.

3053
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:27,600
Just trust me.

3054
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:28,340
It's important.

3055
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,460
You have my word.

3056
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:31,780
You really thought that would work, didn't you?

3057
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:33,500
I don't think so.

3058
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,360
What?

3059
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:35,560
Fine!

3060
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,000
Take my 250.

3061
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,860
Maybe we can reach an agreement.

3062
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:41,620
Fine!

3063
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:44,740
I don't need the bottle caps.

3064
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:45,440
For me?

3065
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:47,420
Oh, how generous.

3066
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:49,480
Oh, there I go again.

3067
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:53,460
Leaving a key out on my desk and forgetting to put it back.

3068
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,040
I don't need the... It's okay.

3069
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:58,220
It's alright.

3070
01:55:58,980 --> 01:55:59,620
Fine.

3071
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:02,240
I don't need it.

3072
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,520
I don't fucking need it.

3073
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:10,620
I don't need the money anyway.

3074
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:12,900
I'll just steal it back.

3075
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:15,760
Where does she live?

3076
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,220
I'm gonna steal those caps back.

3077
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:23,510
I should have stolen it, guys.

3078
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:24,710
Why?

3079
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:26,510
Why did I give her my money?

3080
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:33,740
Alright, let's see.

3081
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,700
We gotta go to Kellogg's place.

3082
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:37,460
Wait, how do I get to Kellogg's place?

3083
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:38,520
Is it here?

3084
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:42,180
Wait, how do I do that?

3085
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,600
I forgot how to get there naturally.

3086
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:45,740
Hahaha!

3087
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:48,860
Like, oh, it's like here.

3088
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:51,020
Oh, it's over here.

3089
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:51,640
I see the stairs.

3090
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:52,160
Alright.

3091
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:54,820
I'm smart!

3092
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,400
I have true intelligence!

3093
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,000
That's smart enough!

3094
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,880
That's enough to pass, like, first grade.

3095
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,500
It's the wasteland!

3096
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:06,840
You don't need to be smart.

3097
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,200
You just gotta have the fucking guns.

3098
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:10,540
I do.

3099
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:12,400
I got the keys.

3100
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:14,180
And even for my baby boy.

3101
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,060
Let's take a look around.

3102
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,980
Kellogg must have left something behind.

3103
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:22,700
Oh!

3104
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:23,700
Oh, I can steal now!

3105
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:27,800
Surely you meant to leave that rubbish where you found it.

3106
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:30,760
Place seems small to you.

3107
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,440
I can sell it all.

3108
01:57:32,540 --> 01:57:34,180
I can make back the money I lost.

3109
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:41,310
I can make back all the money I lost, guys.

3110
01:57:42,230 --> 01:57:42,970
This is it.

3111
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:45,070
Nothing here.

3112
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:47,090
Did you check out that desk?

3113
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:48,690
Is there something on the desk?

3114
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:51,930
You don't understand Cogsworth!

3115
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:53,030
You don't fucking care!

3116
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:55,090
Where is it?

3117
01:57:59,050 --> 01:57:59,930
The broom?

3118
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:05,510
Hey, Valentine.

3119
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:11,170
What is it?

3120
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:12,070
It's so small!

3121
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:15,230
It has to be... No, that's not it.

3122
01:58:15,730 --> 01:58:16,870
That's just a bed.

3123
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:18,330
There's another sleeping bag.

3124
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,770
There's two sleeping bags here.

3125
01:58:22,690 --> 01:58:23,770
Did you see it?

3126
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:28,700
Where is it?

3127
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:34,510
Hidden?

3128
01:58:35,290 --> 01:58:36,370
Oh, I'm hidden.

3129
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:38,430
Huh?

3130
01:58:40,490 --> 01:58:41,930
Oh my god, I got a big book.

3131
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:44,870
Found

3132
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,220
it!

3133
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:50,320
I'm so smart!

3134
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,180
Nuka-Cola!

3135
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:57,380
Nuka-Cola!

3136
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:58,940
Look at this.

3137
01:58:59,180 --> 01:58:59,860
Hey, Valentine.

3138
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:01,320
Look at that.

3139
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:04,720
All of Kellogg's favorite things.

3140
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:10,440
Oh my god, look at all these free stuff.

3141
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,580
Oh my god, used oil.

3142
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,620
Stout beer.

3143
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,600
44 caliber bullets.

3144
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:17,520
Cigars.

3145
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:18,900
Oh my god, Stimpaks!

3146
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:19,320
I need those!

3147
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,820
Hmm, interesting brand.

3148
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:24,580
Won't lead us anywhere on its own, though.

3149
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:27,240
And guns!

3150
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:33,610
Any suggestions, Nuka?

3151
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:33,930
Hmm.

3152
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:36,270
What about dog meat?

3153
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:38,650
How do you know about dog meat?

3154
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:40,470
A man sent for miles.

3155
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:43,310
Why don't you go fetch him and let him have a whiff?

3156
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:45,030
See if he picks up the trail.

3157
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:50,890
Before you head out, I know this is personal business.

3158
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:55,470
If you have to face Kellogg on your own, just say so.

3159
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:58,390
Besides, you already have plenty of company.

3160
01:59:58,710 --> 02:00:02,590
You can't all go sniffing through the Commonwealth after one man.

3161
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:04,710
Wait, come with me!

3162
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:05,970
I want you with me.

3163
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,570
Is he my companion now?

3164
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:09,310
Oh my god, yes!

3165
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:09,830
Leave!

3166
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:15,630
Leave!

3167
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:17,230
I'm my new best friend!

3168
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:20,670
You say jump, I'll say how high.

3169
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:23,510
Yeah!

3170
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:24,070
Time!

3171
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:28,710
He's my new companion now!

3172
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:30,630
Let's go!

3173
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:32,050
Get out!

3174
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:38,350
I found a hotter robot for my eye candy.

3175
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:40,970
Leave me alone, Cogsworth.

3176
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:44,210
Grosses!

3177
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:45,070
Thank you for the super chat!

3178
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:45,390
Thank you!

3179
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:45,810
Thank you!

3180
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:48,610
King shaming for robot appearances now, Doki!

3181
02:00:48,690 --> 02:00:50,210
Shake my head!

3182
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:57,530
Look, if I'm gonna have a robot that's gonna follow me around, he better be good eye candy for me.

3183
02:00:59,330 --> 02:01:00,010
I'm gonna have to get rid of him.

3184
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:01,190
I'm gonna have to get rid of him.

3185
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:05,060
This one's hotter.

3186
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:06,860
He has legs.

3187
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:11,040
Where are your legs, Cogsworth?

3188
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,880
Oh hey, Dogmeat, you're here.

3189
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:17,740
Dogmeat, get the scent, boy.

3190
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:18,340
Yeah, get the scent.

3191
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:23,030
Got the scent?

3192
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:24,750
Got something, boy.

3193
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:34,220
Let's go!

3194
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,660
Is that Cogsworth just slowly walking me?

3195
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:37,920
He's walking back?

3196
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,400
That's right.

3197
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:41,220
Slowly do the walk of shame, Cogsworth!

3198
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,180
That's fucking right!

3199
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:45,760
Look at the person I replaced you with!

3200
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:54,720
Head over there.

3201
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:56,080
Legs are DLC.

3202
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,640
When Cogsworth gets those legs, then we'll talk.

3203
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,600
The walk of shame.

3204
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,300
Yeah!

3205
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:14,080
He has to know his place, guys.

3206
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:17,640
Oh no.

3207
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:19,860
Oh no.

3208
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:22,220
Back to loading screen.

3209
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:25,220
Back to the loading screen.

3210
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:29,260
Alright, here we go.

3211
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,880
Where is it, Dogmeat?

3212
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:32,540
Where is he?

3213
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,440
Where's my son?

3214
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,560
How far is it?

3215
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:45,420
Come on, boy.

3216
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:47,020
Where the fuck is my son?

3217
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:49,740
Oh, I need to charge my AP.

3218
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:53,240
Oh my god, I forgot to get back all my...

3219
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:53,540
No!

3220
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,980
Cogsworth is holding so much of my items!

3221
02:03:02,550 --> 02:03:03,470
Oh no.

3222
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:05,590
I knew I forgot to do something.

3223
02:03:05,850 --> 02:03:09,270
I forgot to take back my items.

3224
02:03:09,930 --> 02:03:10,410
Wait.

3225
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:11,390
Is he somewhere?

3226
02:03:12,130 --> 02:03:13,570
Dogmeat, pick up the Santa Can.

3227
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:14,750
Kellogg's preferred brand, alright.

3228
02:03:16,770 --> 02:03:17,970
Okay, boy.

3229
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:19,210
Let's track him.

3230
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:20,610
Search for these.

3231
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:22,230
He took everything in the divorce.

3232
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:24,990
I can't believe it.

3233
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:26,450
No!

3234
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:30,210
And I said... I forgot to take the stuff back before I...

3235
02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:32,890
Before I shithocked him.

3236
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:35,090
Now he's gonna throw them all away!

3237
02:03:35,210 --> 02:03:36,730
He's gonna throw them to the curb!

3238
02:03:37,390 --> 02:03:39,010
He's gonna throw it from a balcony!

3239
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:43,650
Woo!

3240
02:03:43,890 --> 02:03:44,370
Oh!

3241
02:03:44,370 --> 02:03:44,730
Oh!

3242
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,420
Oh shit!

3243
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:51,840
Oh!

3244
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:54,520
Oh my god.

3245
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:55,280
Guys!

3246
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:55,820
Guys!

3247
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,220
Guys!

3248
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,000
Why did you not tell me to heal?

3249
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:02,360
Guys!

3250
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:07,400
Why did you not tell me to heal, guys?

3251
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:10,200
Nuka Cola.

3252
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:11,440
Nuka Cola.

3253
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:12,820
Yeah.

3254
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,000
Fucking... Fuck off.

3255
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,520
Fuck off!

3256
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:19,940
Yeah!

3257
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:21,160
What is Nick?

3258
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,060
Nick!

3259
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:28,870
Oh my god.

3260
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:30,630
I need to eat these guys.

3261
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:31,990
Oh shit!

3262
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:33,050
He's extra radiated!

3263
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:34,690
I'm crippled!

3264
02:04:36,890 --> 02:04:37,550
Bro!

3265
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:39,050
Oh!

3266
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:39,570
That's a dog!

3267
02:04:44,530 --> 02:04:46,050
Oh my god.

3268
02:04:46,090 --> 02:04:46,690
I'm limping.

3269
02:04:46,870 --> 02:04:47,870
I'm limping.

3270
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:49,330
I'm limping.

3271
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:51,050
Somebody help!

3272
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:54,010
Somebody help!

3273
02:04:54,650 --> 02:04:55,970
There's a stim pack!

3274
02:04:56,150 --> 02:04:57,930
Did I not loot stim packs?

3275
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:00,750
Oh I did.

3276
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:01,070
Okay.

3277
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:01,910
I'm okay now.

3278
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,950
It was just... I'm okay now.

3279
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:04,510
I'm not...

3280
02:05:04,510 --> 02:05:05,550
I can walk again.

3281
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:07,830
I can walk again, guys.

3282
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:12,640
Go to the stat screen?

3283
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:13,360
Why?

3284
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,360
Can I upgrade?

3285
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:15,640
Oh I can!

3286
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,520
I need one... No I can.

3287
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:18,320
You guys lied.

3288
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:18,760
Oh.

3289
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:21,740
Yes.

3290
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:27,760
Use vats?

3291
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:28,820
I don't need vats.

3292
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,880
I have pure skill.

3293
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:32,440
Super chat!

3294
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,740
Thank you for the super chat!

3295
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:34,040
Thank you!

3296
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:34,720
Thank you!

3297
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:36,900
Alright.

3298
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,760
Can't believe it.

3299
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,080
Those fucking moles.

3300
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:47,100
Oh I can use stim packs from this... Oh I can use stim packs from the stat screen!

3301
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,000
Vats... Vats are for pussies!

3302
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:56,540
I don't need vats when I can smash!

3303
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:57,980
Come on!

3304
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:58,960
Go DocMe!

3305
02:05:59,020 --> 02:05:59,180
Go!

3306
02:06:02,590 --> 02:06:03,430
Where is he?

3307
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:06,110
Search clues for Kellogg?

3308
02:06:06,190 --> 02:06:06,630
In here?

3309
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:08,450
Blood splatters?

3310
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:10,870
Look at the blood splatters.

3311
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:11,370
Whoa!

3312
02:06:11,690 --> 02:06:12,530
What the f- Oh!

3313
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:14,070
That's what I looted from!

3314
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:15,650
Oh hey.

3315
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:17,290
Look at all these free stuff.

3316
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:19,330
What did you see, boy?

3317
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:22,730
What is it, boy?

3318
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:24,330
Bloody bandages.

3319
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,170
Dogmeat can track this.

3320
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:30,490
Okay, boy.

3321
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:31,710
Let's track him.

3322
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:34,310
Yeah.

3323
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:36,450
No need for vats when she got the vats.

3324
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,650
Exactly, Zane!

3325
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:38,570
Thank you for the super chat!

3326
02:06:38,690 --> 02:06:38,950
Thank you!

3327
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:39,470
Thank you!

3328
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:39,870
Exactly!

3329
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:42,070
Alright.

3330
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:45,090
Where are they?

3331
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:46,650
Oh shit!

3332
02:06:46,690 --> 02:06:47,530
The evil five!

3333
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:49,310
Oh shit!

3334
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:49,310
The evil five!

3335
02:06:49,330 --> 02:06:49,810
There you go.

3336
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:53,370
Bad boy!

3337
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:56,590
Holy shit!

3338
02:06:57,570 --> 02:06:58,850
Oh my god!

3339
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:01,210
Oh my god!

3340
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:02,910
This is why I got you, Nick!

3341
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:04,010
Bam!

3342
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:05,830
Oh!

3343
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:07,590
Did you see that dog fight?

3344
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:11,530
Bro, my dog- This is the legal type of dog fighting.

3345
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:15,270
Because those are evil dogs.

3346
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:17,050
Wait, we did it, DogMeat.

3347
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:18,890
Wait, where's DogMeat?

3348
02:07:18,910 --> 02:07:19,510
Where did he go?

3349
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:22,750
Where did DogMeat go?

3350
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:25,670
Wait, actually, where the fuck did my dog go?

3351
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:31,250
Guys, I lost my dog.

3352
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:34,590
Guys.

3353
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:36,410
I lost him.

3354
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:38,550
My dog's gone.

3355
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:44,360
They're evil dogs!

3356
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,700
We just literally saw two dogs fighting.

3357
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:52,280
Wait, where's DogMeat?

3358
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,020
DogMeat!

3359
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:55,140
DogMeat?

3360
02:07:57,100 --> 02:07:58,300
Where did DogMeat go?

3361
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:04,300
I need to turn on the quest.

3362
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,140
I might as well.

3363
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:06,020
Reunions.

3364
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:07,140
Follow DogMeat.

3365
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:07,700
Where did he go?

3366
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:09,480
Oh, he went this way.

3367
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:10,500
Is that it?

3368
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,320
Is that the real quest?

3369
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:12,780
No.

3370
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:14,140
This is the quest.

3371
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:17,600
He's over here.

3372
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:19,640
Oh, he's barking at me!

3373
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:20,920
He's calling me stupid!

3374
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:22,720
Bro, DogMeat!

3375
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:23,380
Wear a vest!

3376
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:26,340
We need to wear a reflected vest, DogMeat!

3377
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:28,080
DogMeat, I can barely see where you are!

3378
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:30,560
I'll loot that.

3379
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:38,170
Come on, DogMeat.

3380
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:38,890
Where are they?

3381
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:39,790
Where's Kellogg?

3382
02:08:40,050 --> 02:08:40,810
The cereal.

3383
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:43,850
Oh my god, that's a bear.

3384
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:44,550
That's a bear.

3385
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:45,770
That's a fucking bear!

3386
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:47,590
DogMeat, why?!

3387
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:49,930
I can't fucking fight a bear!

3388
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:50,750
Oh, I'm gonna fight a bear.

3389
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:52,570
I'm gonna fight a bear.

3390
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:54,230
Oh, that is not the...

3391
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:55,270
Oh!

3392
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:58,590
Okay, but what?

3393
02:08:59,410 --> 02:08:59,930
Oh...

3394
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:02,010
How much damage do I do?

3395
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:03,210
I do...

3396
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:03,510
Oh!

3397
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:05,350
That was a mistake!

3398
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:06,410
That was a mistake!

3399
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:12,930
Guys...

3400
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:14,650
Guys...

3401
02:09:14,650 --> 02:09:15,910
I don't...

3402
02:09:17,210 --> 02:09:17,850
I...

3403
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:18,730
I...

3404
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:29,620
It's not just a bear.

3405
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:30,960
This is...

3406
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,200
Guys, it was not just a bear.

3407
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:34,040
Guys...

3408
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:35,240
Guys, it was...

3409
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:36,040
It was...

3410
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:36,880
It was...

3411
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:39,920
Oh my god.

3412
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,040
I had to fight the dogs again?!

3413
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:44,220
Alright, guys.

3414
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:45,860
It was not just a bear.

3415
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:46,740
I've learned...

3416
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:52,920
I've learned that it was absolutely much worse than just a bear.

3417
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:53,960
Alright.

3418
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:57,220
It was...

3419
02:09:57,680 --> 02:09:59,660
It was a radioactive bear.

3420
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,820
I can't believe I didn't save.

3421
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,740
I can't believe we're gonna kill a bear today.

3422
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:11,410
It's okay.

3423
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:11,570
Okay.

3424
02:10:11,610 --> 02:10:13,590
Low seven to low fifteen zone.

3425
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:14,510
What, like it's hard?

3426
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:19,690
We can do this!

3427
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:21,970
I believe in us!

3428
02:10:23,290 --> 02:10:24,810
Can't be that difficult!

3429
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:31,610
Okay.

3430
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:32,430
Okay.

3431
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:32,750
Okay.

3432
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:34,130
Okay.

3433
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:34,870
Okay.

3434
02:10:35,530 --> 02:10:36,190
Okay.

3435
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:39,610
Okay.

3436
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:41,050
Okay.

3437
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:41,370
Okay.

3438
02:10:41,370 --> 02:10:41,390
Okay.

3439
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:41,550
We're gonna be so fine.

3440
02:10:41,730 --> 02:10:42,550
We're gonna be so healthy.

3441
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,710
Alright, we're gonna grab...

3442
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:46,250
let's see, a comfort grip.

3443
02:10:47,290 --> 02:10:49,970
Uh... ooh, this is a better pistol actually.

3444
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:52,330
And then... oh, I should grab a shotgun.

3445
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:53,690
Nevermind, I'm grabbing a shotgun.

3446
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:55,430
We're gonna be fucking shooting bears.

3447
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,370
We're gonna grab a...

3448
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,200
What the fuck?

3449
02:11:00,660 --> 02:11:02,600
I'd rather just fucking grab a pistol.

3450
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:05,280
These guys take so long!

3451
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:10,140
Bro, what the fuck?

3452
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:11,620
It was easier to just...

3453
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:12,000
Wow!

3454
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:13,960
Okay, I'm fucking grabbing a...

3455
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:15,980
The shotgun sucks!

3456
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,840
The shotgun fucking sucks!

3457
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,500
What the hell?

3458
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:21,800
Look at this pistol.

3459
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,420
Watch this pistol.

3460
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,160
Oh my god, the pistol is faster.

3461
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:27,960
Look, see?

3462
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:29,640
Wait, no.

3463
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:32,140
Yeah, the pistol is so much faster!

3464
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:34,300
I need some dog meat.

3465
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:37,740
Alright.

3466
02:11:37,980 --> 02:11:39,760
Alright guys, I gotta figure this out.

3467
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:41,580
I gotta...

3468
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:43,420
I gotta figure this out what gun to use.

3469
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:45,160
Cause all these guns fucking suck.

3470
02:11:47,380 --> 02:11:48,580
The auto-pistol.

3471
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,240
Let's see.

3472
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:54,940
Uhhhh...

3473
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:55,700
I don't know!

3474
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:57,720
What's the best gun to fight the...

3475
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:59,020
The minigun?

3476
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:01,140
To fight the bear?

3477
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:07,060
Okay.

3478
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:08,540
Okay, maybe...

3479
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:09,840
This gun.

3480
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:11,540
This gun would be okay.

3481
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:14,380
Alright, we're gonna save.

3482
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:16,080
We're gonna save.

3483
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:20,080
Alright.

3484
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,480
We're gonna see a bear soon.

3485
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:32,150
Alright.

3486
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:33,250
It's bear time.

3487
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:37,250
Oh, that's the worst gun I could use?

3488
02:12:37,450 --> 02:12:37,690
Okay.

3489
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:40,510
Okay.

3490
02:12:40,770 --> 02:12:41,370
Alright.

3491
02:12:43,670 --> 02:12:44,870
Okay, maybe...

3492
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:48,270
We can do something with this gun, right?

3493
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:50,050
Where's the bear?

3494
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:50,630
Is he here?

3495
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:51,850
Is he here again?

3496
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:53,490
Is the bear back?

3497
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:54,890
Wait.

3498
02:12:55,070 --> 02:12:55,870
Was I just...

3499
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:56,250
Oh, wait.

3500
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:56,730
There he is.

3501
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:00,930
Oh, god.

3502
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:01,670
Oh, god.

3503
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:02,490
Oh, god.

3504
02:13:03,670 --> 02:13:04,150
Oh, god.

3505
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:04,490
Hit it.

3506
02:13:04,530 --> 02:13:04,910
Hit it.

3507
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:05,210
Hit it.

3508
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:05,610
No!

3509
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:07,110
Give me the crit!

3510
02:13:07,210 --> 02:13:07,690
Give me the crit!

3511
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:09,050
Is that...

3512
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:16,680
Oh, god!

3513
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:17,480
Nick, shoot him!

3514
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:19,640
Nick, shoot him for the love of god!

3515
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:20,440
Shoot the bear!

3516
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,180
Oh, god.

3517
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:24,520
Nick, shoot him!

3518
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:25,240
Oh, god.

3519
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:28,100
Oh, god.

3520
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:28,980
Sacrifice yourself!

3521
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:34,160
Nick, sacrifice yourself for me!

3522
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:36,920
Sacrifice yourself!

3523
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:41,540
Don't you ever...

3524
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:45,460
Oh, I ran out of ammo.

3525
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:48,080
I ran out of ammo.

3526
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:52,660
It's waterproof.

3527
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:00,140
Oh my god!

3528
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:01,600
I fucking knew you would reject!

3529
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:03,040
No!

3530
02:14:08,050 --> 02:14:09,130
Holy shit.

3531
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:12,110
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

3532
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:14,770
Holy shit.

3533
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:21,330
Oh my god, please, dog, please reject.

3534
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:23,490
I'm trying.

3535
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:24,850
Oh, the dragon buster!

3536
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:26,510
The dragon buster!

3537
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:31,560
Oh god!

3538
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:33,840
Reload, reload, reload, reload, reload!

3539
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:36,860
Reload, reload, reload!

3540
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:37,660
Nick!

3541
02:14:37,820 --> 02:14:38,640
Take this Nick!

3542
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:39,200
Take this!

3543
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:39,580
Take this!

3544
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:39,900
Take this!

3545
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:43,800
Good job Nick!

3546
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,240
Oh my god, where is he?

3547
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:50,800
Oh my god, I can't even see him.

3548
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:53,840
You got this Nick!

3549
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:55,680
3%!

3550
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:56,860
I'll take my odds!

3551
02:14:57,580 --> 02:14:58,480
Oh my god.

3552
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:01,560
Oh my god.

3553
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:02,520
Did I hit him?

3554
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:04,160
Guys, I don't think I'll hit him.

3555
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:05,060
It's okay!

3556
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:07,780
You got this Nick!

3557
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,600
We did it.

3558
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:12,280
It was that easy.

3559
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,140
Oh my god.

3560
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:22,830
Holy shit, we fucking did it.

3561
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:25,050
Oh my god, let me fucking save.

3562
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:26,390
Holy fuck.

3563
02:15:27,370 --> 02:15:28,770
Okay, we did it.

3564
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:31,510
Use your companions as bait so you can live.

3565
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:33,310
The Doki Bridge trap.

3566
02:15:34,090 --> 02:15:36,170
Guys, who wants to be my companion guys?

3567
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:43,470
Not even close.

3568
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:48,010
We did it.

3569
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:53,120
You're right.

3570
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:53,860
It's not we.

3571
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:54,920
I did it.

3572
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,020
You're right guys.

3573
02:15:58,260 --> 02:15:58,760
You're right.

3574
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:00,680
I did it.

3575
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:02,020
You know the drill.

3576
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:05,180
What's this?

3577
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,420
Are you fucking kidding me?

3578
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:14,040
A decoy, huh?

3579
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:15,520
Clever.

3580
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:18,920
Is this enough?

3581
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:22,020
Is that it?

3582
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:26,480
Wait, where did... where Dogmeat is?

3583
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:27,540
Where he is?

3584
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:29,440
Oh hey, more clues.

3585
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:30,980
Oh, more sitting down.

3586
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:34,020
Alright.

3587
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:38,520
Where you wanna go, Dogmeat?

3588
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:41,960
Where are you going?

3589
02:16:49,370 --> 02:16:51,010
Where are we going, Dogmeat?

3590
02:16:58,790 --> 02:17:00,330
Woah woah woah woah woah.

3591
02:17:00,390 --> 02:17:00,590
Oh

3592
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:07,550
my god, there's more?

3593
02:17:10,070 --> 02:17:11,110
How much more?

3594
02:17:12,590 --> 02:17:13,630
Vicious Snar?

3595
02:17:13,930 --> 02:17:15,170
Don't worry, Dogmeat.

3596
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:15,930
I'll come over.

3597
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:22,040
I got the gains.

3598
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:23,900
See, it's that easy.

3599
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,540
Oh shit.

3600
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:28,180
Easy.

3601
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:30,000
LEGENDARY!

3602
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,520
Okay.

3603
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,120
Did I miss?

3604
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:34,700
How did I miss?

3605
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,400
Oh god.

3606
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:37,380
Don't let him hit me.

3607
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:38,320
No!

3608
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:55,190
Oh my god, you're fucking kidding me.

3609
02:17:55,290 --> 02:17:56,890
You brought it to... Okay.

3610
02:17:57,630 --> 02:17:58,830
Okay guys.

3611
02:18:03,470 --> 02:18:05,790
How was I supposed to know?

3612
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:07,490
He one-shots!

3613
02:18:09,550 --> 02:18:10,770
Oh thank god.

3614
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:12,110
At least I saved after the bear.

3615
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:14,390
Oh thank god I saved after the bear.

3616
02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:16,770
Oh thank fucking god.

3617
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:18,850
I would've been so sad.

3618
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:22,230
If I had to do the bear again.

3619
02:18:22,730 --> 02:18:24,090
Oh my god.

3620
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:25,690
It was planned, chat.

3621
02:18:25,890 --> 02:18:27,370
It was planned so I can...

3622
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:29,350
So I can disarm this.

3623
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:32,010
A decoy, huh?

3624
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:33,350
Clever.

3625
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:35,090
Guys, it was planned.

3626
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:35,710
Do I hit it?

3627
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:39,430
Guys, don't hit it.

3628
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:39,930
Guys.

3629
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:54,220
Okay, I'm gonna call it here.

3630
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:54,920
I think...

3631
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:57,360
I'm gonna call it here.

3632
02:18:57,980 --> 02:18:58,380
I...

3633
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:02,600
I'm gonna call it here.

3634
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:03,360
I think that's a good...

3635
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:10,620
This is where we're calling it today.

3636
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:12,960
This is where we're calling it today.

3637
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:18,300
I think that was the point where I was like, my mind's not working anymore.

3638
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:19,380
My...

3639
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:26,160
I don't... You guys were like, oh you can disarm it.

3640
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,520
Use your vats and you can disarm it.

3641
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:33,500
But I think somebody meant like, use your vats to find... find... like, mines.

3642
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:36,380
But then I thought like, oh use my vats to disarm it.

3643
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,260
That's where my mind went into.

3644
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:43,040
But then I realized, oh they meant like, if you can't... don't know where the mines are, you can use your vats.

3645
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:44,900
But I didn't read the last part.

3646
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:47,780
I read the beginning where someone said, use vats.

3647
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:50,520
And then I didn't read the end of the sentence.

3648
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,040
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

3649
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:56,820
Thank you, thank you.

3650
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:58,440
You know Piper is a good companion to you.

3651
02:19:58,460 --> 02:19:59,600
She has a face and legs.

3652
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:00,300
Thank you for the super chat.

3653
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:00,720
Thank you, thank you.

3654
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:02,260
But she's not a hot robot.

3655
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:03,720
That's the only thing.

3656
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:04,880
Guys.

3657
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:07,200
That's the only thing that like, is the deal breaker.

3658
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:12,340
Oh my god.

3659
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:17,520
Today was a very long, long day today.

3660
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,180
I'm sorry I didn't stream more fun.

3661
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:23,960
Sorry I didn't do a longer fun stream.

3662
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:27,780
But we did a really long Monopoly stream.

3663
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:29,100
So I'm gonna add that in together.

3664
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:31,340
So it was a double stream today.

3665
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:34,460
But I did have a lot of fun today.

3666
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,760
Guys, I hope you guys had a lot of fun as well.

3667
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:37,560
Chat.

3668
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:40,640
It was a very, very long day.

3669
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:45,980
But I hope you guys enjoyed today.

3670
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:47,700
I actually didn't even eat dinner yet.

3671
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:48,780
I didn't eat dinner yet.

3672
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:52,640
So I'm gonna go and order some food for dinner.

3673
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:57,180
But it really was a great time just spending my day with you guys.

3674
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:01,160
And as always, everybody stay hydrated.

3675
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:02,300
Posture check.

3676
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:03,260
Get up and move around.

3677
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:04,700
To get that blood flowing.

3678
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:07,260
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3679
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:08,640
Because you deserve it.

3680
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,800
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3681
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:11,020
Bye guys.

3682
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:12,400
Bye.

3683
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:15,500
Sorry it was like a really quick ending everyone.

3684
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:16,540
Sorry, sorry.

3685
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,980
I just really want to get food.

3686
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:22,380
So I can't chat for too long.

3687
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,080
Because I won't order food before like places close down.

3688
02:21:26,420 --> 02:21:29,400
So I'll see you guys the day after tomorrow.

3689
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:30,360
Bye bye.
