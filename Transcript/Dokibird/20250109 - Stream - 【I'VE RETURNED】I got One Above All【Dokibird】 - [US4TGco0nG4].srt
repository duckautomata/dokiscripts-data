1
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm back on YouTube!

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
I'm here!

3
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,180
Guys, did you miss me?

4
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,460
YouTube goons who refuse to use Twitch.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
Which is understandable.

6
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,060
I understand.

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,440
Twitch is like a whole other platform for those who are not used to Twitch.

8
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,340
Because like, there's like a lot of ads on Twitch.

9
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,880
And you can't really skip them unless you have like the appropriate plug-in.

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,580
But even that is like quite difficult.

11
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,700
And I heard like Twitch in general, it's not optimized for people with like...

12
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,580
Not the best internet too, which is very understandable.

13
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,380
And also I believe... I believe... Is it still banned in Korea?

14
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,680
I don't know if like, Twitch is... I think you just can't stream on Twitch, right?

15
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,140
Or is it like banned in Korea or in general?

16
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,600
Oh yeah, there's like, you know, there's all of that stuff.

17
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
So like, I understand, yeah.

18
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,280
Yeah, I... I understand, guys.

19
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,440
But I'm back!

20
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm back on YouTube, everybody!

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm finally... I've returned to become a normal person again.

22
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,480
I didn't... After... For those who don't know...

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,860
For those who don't know, I have been...

24
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,600
The reason why I've like disappeared on YouTube...

25
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,520
Was because I was terminally brain-rotted on Marvel Rivals.

26
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,680
Essentially, I really, really, really wanted to...

27
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,760
Welcome home, G!

28
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,520
Thank you for the super chat!

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,680
Thank you, thank you!

30
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,260
I was terminally ill.

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,520
Not literally though, but like...

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,520
With Marvel Rivals brain rot.

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,520
So because of that, I was trying to get...

34
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,100
I was trying to secure top 500 slash one above all.

35
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,700
The highest ranking in Marvel Rivals.

36
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,340
Because... Just because my fragile ego needs...

37
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,280
Just guess!

38
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
I wanna be the best!

39
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,700
Alright, guys!

40
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,380
Is that what you want me to say?

41
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,460
I think I'm like literally the only VTuber that's on the leaderboard right now, I think.

42
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,100
At this moment, I think I'm the only...

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,720
The highest ranked VTuber at the moment on the leaderboard.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,360
So like, I don't know!

45
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,860
Bragging rights, alright?

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
I wanna brag!

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,700
Is that too much to ask for?

48
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,040
I just wanted to brag about it!

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,980
It's just, um...

50
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,100
Isn't Mac a VTuber?

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
He's not even on the leaderboard!

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,780
That's right!

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,460
So... Yeah, that's right!

54
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,880
I got to brag it to...

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
That's right, everybody!

56
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,020
I just want...

57
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,960
I get nothing out of it!

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,400
Other than the fact that...

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,180
Boom!

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,760
Doesn't this look shoddy?

61
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,120
Zantrea's not even on the leaderboard!

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,220
What do you mean?

63
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,080
I think she's like diamond right now.

64
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,180
I'm literally one above all!

65
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,160
That's like three tiers!

66
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,880
That's...

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,540
That's okay, right!

68
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,440
That's me!

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,580
SK's not on it!

70
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,920
SK's not on it either!

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,280
So, yeah, that's right!

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,360
Currently, I am currently the highest ranked VTuber in Marvel Rivals!

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,480
That's me!

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,720
Right there!

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,640
The top of the mountain!

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
Right now!

77
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,300
Alright, it's not 161.

78
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm like at 230.

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
It's a little scary.

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,420
Oh, she just made it!

81
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,100
Oh, she just made it!

82
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,660
Oh my god, congratulations SK!

83
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,480
I checked this morning and I didn't realize she just made it.

84
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,000
But I'm still highest ranked right now!

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
That's looking right!

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,740
That's me!

87
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,480
Also, it is a little scary because...

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,740
It's very scary because it is going really, really, really, really fast.

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,380
Alright!

90
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Look, everybody!

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,120
A lot of people were min-maxing, okay!

92
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,900
I was hardstuck GM for so fucking long!

93
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,460
You guys were all there!

94
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,160
You guys literally saw me be hardstuck GM, chat!

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
You were all fucking there!

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,320
And so many people fucking min-maxed to get to the top 100.

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,520
Everybody was min-maxing for stacking, guys.

98
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Anyway, so...

99
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,560
I am a little scared because it is climbing incredibly fast.

100
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
Oh yeah, and I was getting stream sniped like hard.

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,200
Apparently, I found out I was basically getting stream sniped every day while I was on Twitch.

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
And I was like, what do you want from me?

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
I'm just like...

104
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,800
I was just like, bro...

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Like, Sinatraa stream...

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,040
Okay, I was telling this to one of my friends.

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,980
And then they're like...

108
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,900
I was like, why are they stream sniping me?

109
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,820
Literally, Sinatraa and a friend are streaming and they're right beside me in the category.

110
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,840
I don't understand.

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,180
And then my friend was like...

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,560
Yeah, but they're fucking DPS.

113
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,840
Why the fuck would they stream snipe a DPS player?

114
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,740
Like...

115
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,540
I'm like...

116
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,700
Exactly why

117
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,610
they stream snipe you!

118
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,210
You're just to support me!

119
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,890
They're not gonna fucking stream snipe a DPS player.

120
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,870
That's too risky!

121
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,290
I was like...

122
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,590
That's so fucked up!

123
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,530
That's so fucked up!

124
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,770
And then...

125
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,070
And also like...

126
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,470
On the last day...

127
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,450
The climb ended earlier because...

128
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,690
On the last day of the climb...

129
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,330
The season's not over yet.

130
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,290
The season's not over yet.

131
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,210
So like...

132
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,290
There's still one day...

133
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,890
I believe one day and four hours left of the season.

134
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,590
I believe.

135
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,070
I don't know.

136
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,990
Maybe it's five hours.

137
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,970
I just know it's like one day and a couple of hours left.

138
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,250
So...

139
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,190
It's very scary.

140
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,570
Because it's climbing.

141
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,810
It's climbing incredibly fast.

142
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,170
So...

143
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,110
On the last day of my rank climb...

144
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,170
I basically...

145
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,030
Got a four stack organized.

146
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,830
Because that's basically how people fucking climb these days.

147
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,150
Oh my gosh.

148
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,070
I hope they limit stacking for...

149
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,050
At least eternity or grandmaster.

150
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,150
I hope they limit stacking for grandmaster and up.

151
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,030
Because I think it's so dumb.

152
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:14,970
But like...

153
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,890
That's what everybody's been doing to secure top five.

154
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,190
That's what almost everybody's doing to secure top 500.

155
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,710
And like secure their top...

156
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,810
Like at least top 10.

157
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,710
Because everybody just four stacks now.

158
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,410
Because it's just min-maxing.

159
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,550
And then like...

160
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,570
So I got...

161
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,590
So that's basically what I just four stacked.

162
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,590
And then we had 11 wins in a row.

163
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,450
I'm like...

164
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,130
Oh my god.

165
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,370
This is...

166
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,270
Surforce solo queued GigaChad.

167
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,990
Yeah, but then he goes into...

168
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,290
He hit 300.

169
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,430
But he could have stopped there.

170
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,550
And then he kept going.

171
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,550
And then lost 6 games in a row.

172
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,370
So...

173
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,650
So...

174
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,610
He got greedy.

175
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,710
He literally could have stopped there.

176
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,110
And secured top 500.

177
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,530
Like...

178
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,870
And now he's not in top 500 anymore.

179
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:08,850
Anyway...

180
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,350
So it's just really risky.

181
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,950
Because you're literally betting on the RNG gods.

182
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,550
That you don't bump into any of the other four stacks.

183
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,290
And then I was tired of bumping into stacks.

184
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,160
I was so fucking tired of getting RNG'd.

185
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,850
Getting stream sniped.

186
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,510
And bumping into stacks.

187
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,750
That on the last day of my rank grind.

188
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,550
I finally became VTuber Shroud.

189
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,450
And got my own four stack.

190
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,210
And min-maxed my way back up.

191
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,090
So like...

192
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,950
I was so fucking tired.

193
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,770
And...

194
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,610
And then...

195
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:44,990
So like...

196
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,070
I was the London Spitfire...

197
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,650
Stack that was playing at 2 in the morning.

198
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,370
That was me.

199
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,130
I finally...

200
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,870
I got farmed by London Spitfire in Overwatch 1.

201
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,370
So many times.

202
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,630
At 2 in the morning.

203
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,090
That it was my turn.

204
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,370
I will fucking...

205
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,790
I will be...

206
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,130
I will enable the cycle of abuse.

207
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,470
And now it's my turn to farm the...

208
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,950
The...

209
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,950
The fucking solo queuers.

210
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,470
At 2 in the morning.

211
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,550
That's right.

212
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,530
Anyway...

213
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,250
You were supposed to stop the cycle.

214
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,810
No!

215
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,030
I will continue the cycle.

216
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,410
Anyway...

217
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,890
Anyway, so...

218
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,650
If things go wrong...

219
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,250
If things go wrong...

220
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,770
I might have to play some more.

221
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,190
I think it doesn't help that it's a global leaderboard too.

222
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,050
It's also...

223
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,570
You know what?

224
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,190
I want to fucking brag about it.

225
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,150
I'm going to put this right here.

226
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:55,810
I think...

227
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,670
Sorry, Longun.

228
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,270
You're replaced by my new favorite.

229
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,750
Sorry.

230
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,230
Sorry, Longun.

231
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,010
But this...

232
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,170
This is where...

233
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,970
This is...

234
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,130
This is daddy's new favorite toy.

235
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,770
Yippee.

236
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,550
I'll put this here too.

237
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,470
Whoops.

238
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,050
Okay.

239
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,610
So anyway, as I was saying...

240
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,950
As I was...

241
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,750
As I was saying...

242
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,830
If things go really bad...

243
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,650
I might have to play tomorrow.

244
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,930
But I'm not sure.

245
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,610
I was talking to Gomez...

246
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,810
Who was...

247
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,450
If you guys watched...

248
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,530
By the way, if you didn't watch the grind...

249
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,590
If you didn't watch the grind...

250
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,530
Out of all of the people that were playing with me...

251
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,910
On the last day...

252
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,610
Super Gomez...

253
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,850
Who is part of the...

254
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,650
Who is part of the...

255
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,530
Top 2 teams.

256
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,630
I was gonna say number 1, but then they got second place.

257
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,310
I'm saying that as BM.

258
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,050
I'm just stating...

259
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,610
I didn't wanna fucking give...

260
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,970
The wrong facts here.

261
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,330
But...

262
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,610
The top 2 Marble Rivals professional team...

263
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,570
He was the only one...

264
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,550
That stayed till the end.

265
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,650
Which was 10 plus hours of playing Marble Rivals.

266
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,050
So...

267
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,450
Everybody left...

268
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,110
Like every...

269
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,310
We had people dropping in and out.

270
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,970
And Super Gomez...

271
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,930
Was literally the only one...

272
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,810
That survived till the end.

273
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,950
And...

274
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,750
I found out yesterday...

275
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,330
That he was actually a Dragoon.

276
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,010
Guys...

277
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,510
I was so surprised.

278
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,150
I thought...

279
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,950
You know, I thought...

280
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,050
Sometimes I feel like...

281
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,070
When people say like...

282
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,510
Oh my...

283
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:38,890
Like...

284
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,150
You know, I don't know if they're actually Dragoons or not.

285
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,130
But I found out that...

286
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,610
He actually watched...

287
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,330
He actually like...

288
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,450
Watched me...

289
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,270
When I was corporate.

290
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,550
Cause he was like...

291
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,510
Yeah...

292
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:57,870
Like...

293
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,090
I checked you out since debut.

294
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,110
And I was like...

295
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,350
What?

296
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,790
You mean like...

297
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,130
Before?

298
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,550
And he was like...

299
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,070
Yeah...

300
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,330
Yeah...

301
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,670
I checked you out on debut.

302
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,990
And then like...

303
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,970
I really...

304
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,450
Like...

305
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,730
Your Apex stuff is what really hooked me in.

306
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,530
And I'm like...

307
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,030
What?

308
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,250
I was like...

309
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,210
I was so...

310
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,830
I was so surprised.

311
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,890
I was not expecting that at all.

312
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,490
Cause he was saying like...

313
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,590
Oh my god...

314
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,950
Like...

315
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,430
No but...

316
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,930
I was like...

317
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,470
Oh man...

318
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,450
I was so surprised you guys did all that.

319
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:27,750
Like...

320
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,890
You didn't even know who I was.

321
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,690
And then he was like...

322
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:29,930
Yeah...

323
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,470
I was like the only one that actually knew...

324
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,730
Like...

325
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,790
Actually watched you.

326
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,590
So I was like...

327
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,770
I had to get you to...

328
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,130
I...

329
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,310
It was my goal.

330
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,490
To get you to one above all.

331
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,410
I would stop at nothing to get that goal for you.

332
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,070
And I was like...

333
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,030
Holy fuck...

334
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,150
What?

335
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,610
Holy fuck...

336
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,670
You literally...

337
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,570
That's why you stuck it til the end.

338
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,130
Oh my god.

339
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,530
That was crazy.

340
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,570
I did not...

341
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,110
I did not...

342
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,430
I did not...

343
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,490
I did not...

344
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,570
Expect that at all.

345
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,330
So yeah...

346
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,610
Shoutout to...

347
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,570
The strongest soldier.

348
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,030
Shoutout to like...

349
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,090
Super Gomez for...

350
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,490
For sticking it out.

351
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,090
And basically...

352
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,830
We were talking yesterday...

353
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,050
Cause I was like thanking them...

354
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,130
That was like...

355
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,710
I was like, yeah, thanks again guys.

356
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,430
Like, I'm so sorry.

357
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,290
Like, you guys could've... you didn't... I said not have to do that.

358
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:37,370
And... and, um, they're like, um, alright, we will call in... we will call in an emergency stack tomorrow if it gets risky tomorrow.

359
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,050
If it gets scary.

360
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,650
If it gets really scary tomorrow, we will form... we will reform the stack.

361
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,390
So... so I'm... I'm hoping we don't have to come to that.

362
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,510
Because it's so... it's always so scary to play on the last day.

363
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,290
I... I'm... I'm scared.

364
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,130
I'm so fucking...

365
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,870
I'm so scared, guys.

366
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,310
So, um, um, so we'll see.

367
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,410
We'll see, chat.

368
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,250
Uh, but yeah, it was, uh, crazy the entire... the entire time was incredibly crazy.

369
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:29,170
But I am getting an editor, uh, an editor to... to put all of it together.

370
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,470
So for those who have missed out on... like, it's a lot of videos.

371
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,650
It's like 30 plus hours of content.

372
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,870
So, um, uh, so do not worry, guys.

373
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,990
But it won't come out until two weeks, though.

374
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,770
Because, like I said, it's 30 plus hours of content.

375
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:50,010
So most likely it won't be ready until, like, two... two to three weeks, the video itself.

376
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,370
It's a lot of editing.

377
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,190
You're gonna edit out all the music.

378
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,090
Guys, I'm reformed now, guys.

379
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:05,150
I've... I've become... I've become less hateful now that, like, Marble Ra... the grind is over, chat.

380
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,330
I've returned back to normal.

381
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,590
I... other than the fact that I can't believe they gave Rocky Raccoon a fucking bounty hunter skin.

382
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,430
I'm so... I was so...

383
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,150
It's like, are you serious?

384
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:28,490
So, Rocky Raccoon has a bounty hunter skin, and I'm so... other than that, that makes me mad.

385
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,190
But other than that, I'm okay now.

386
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,450
I... I'm so okay now.

387
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,410
Um, anyway, um, time to fucking... rodent!

388
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,890
Uh, but yeah, it was a long journey to get there.

389
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,090
I mean, I literally disappeared off of YouTube, and I'm so sorry.

390
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,190
I... I hope you guys didn't forget about me.

391
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,230
I hope... I hope the YouTube Raccoons didn't move on.

392
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,450
I'm still here, everybody!

393
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,930
I'm still here!

394
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,990
Also, nonetheless, thank you for the super chat.

395
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,650
Thank you, thank you.

396
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,530
Oh my god, Doki, did you win at Marble Rivals yet?

397
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,610
I don't know, it's... it's very scary.

398
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:18,470
There's still, like, around 24 hours left of the grind... of the... the... the lumber stuff.

399
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,210
But, like, oh my gosh, I can't even work.

400
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,930
Um, ever since I got... ever since that stream, I actually haven't touched Marble Rivals since.

401
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,990
Like, I literally just... I felt like I was freed.

402
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,070
Like...

403
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,770
When I turned on D.Va, no!

404
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,930
Alright, I turned it off.

405
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,950
Alright, there you go.

406
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,590
Alright, guys, I've been so long!

407
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,650
It's been so long since I've been on YouTube, I already forgot all my settings!

408
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,110
Doug, thank you for the super chat.

409
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,870
Thank you, thank you.

410
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,550
Doki is back on YouTube and turned on D.Va.

411
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,870
Doki loves us.

412
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,310
Doug, thank you for the super chat.

413
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,590
Thank you.

414
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,450
Anyway, now that you said that, I'm turning off D.Va.

415
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,210
Now...

416
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,690
Thank you for the super chat.

417
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,490
Thank you, thank you.

418
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,770
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

419
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,570
Thank you, thank you.

420
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,690
Who are you again?

421
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,550
Congrats on 1 above all.

422
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,690
Thank you for the super chat.

423
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,390
Thank you, thank you.

424
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,010
So it's like, I moved to Twitch for you!

425
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,910
Look, alright, speaking of Twitch, I talked about this before last year.

426
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,510
Like, around like, I guess like last month, but technically it was last year.

427
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,610
But basically, I'm planning on doing Twitch streams once a week.

428
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,030
Or like once every other week, because I don't want to make like super promises.

429
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,670
But I'm planning on doing more Twitch streams more regularly.

430
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,750
By regularly, I meant like once a week, or once every other week.

431
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,510
So, because like, I feel like, this was asked by my manager to do.

432
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:51,250
Because they feel like it definitely builds my career up more.

433
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,190
Because it was crazy!

434
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,350
And then they were like, see, I told you!

435
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,070
Because, you know, they were right.

436
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,750
Because I was number one in the Marvel Rivals category.

437
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,330
Yeah, there's like a good place to grow more.

438
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,930
And it will be scheduled, though.

439
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:11,290
But the content of my Twitch streams will not be like concrete.

440
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,290
So, if I'm streaming on Twitch, it'll be like...

441
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,050
It'll basically be like whatever I feel like doing.

442
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,290
Which is most likely be Marvel Rivals.

443
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,920
It might be mostly Marvel Rivals.

444
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm just gonna tell you that.

445
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,120
I'm just gonna...

446
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,240
So, anyway.

447
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,560
But I won't be...

448
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,220
Some people are like, are you gonna do React content on Twitch?

449
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,080
Not really, unless I outright say it on my schedule.

450
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,220
Because I don't really want to do React content in general.

451
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,000
Because I don't... I feel like if I get into...

452
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,340
Because I also want to have those VODs up.

453
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,660
And like, I heard they do like React content and stuff.

454
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,160
I know you can just cut it out, but like...

455
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,880
I just wanna...

456
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,680
If I'm uploading the VODs on my VOD channel...

457
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,840
By the way, the VOD channel is back.

458
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,500
If I'm uploading VODs on my VOD channel...

459
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,480
I don't wanna fucking cut the VODs.

460
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,580
Like, I don't wanna cut the VODs.

461
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,460
So, most likely like...

462
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,660
I will be just mostly just...

463
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,440
And I won't be playing games that are games I have never played yet.

464
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,020
Unless they're like something that's like...

465
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,860
I know I could like...

466
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,120
I won't be doing like a standalone stream on YouTube.

467
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,280
So like, I won't be like start...

468
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,800
Because when I was on Twitch...

469
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,920
And we had a fucking 30 to 40 minute queue on Marvel Rivals.

470
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,360
At one point, I had to...

471
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,420
I couldn't wait another 30 minutes for the next game.

472
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,780
So I was just like...

473
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,400
I pulled up Roblox to play on stream.

474
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,660
Because I was like...

475
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,680
But people were like...

476
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,600
You should play Bellatro while we wait.

477
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,040
But I didn't wanna start a game that I haven't been able to stream on YouTube.

478
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,480
So that's why I will only be doing games on Twitch.

479
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,660
If I've already done it on YouTube.

480
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Or if I feel like they're games that like...

481
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,600
I won't be doing like a standalone stream for.

482
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,900
So basically, I'll just be streaming whatever the fuck I want on Twitch.

483
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,500
There won't be like scheduled stuff.

484
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,980
So basically like what every other Twitch streamer does.

485
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,960
Where they just go live.

486
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,780
And they play like an assortment of stuff.

487
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,120
But for me, it mostly might be Marvel Rivals.

488
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,160
Let me just get it to you straight.

489
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,840
It most likely be Marvel Rivals.

490
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,640
Like I'm not gonna fucking lie to you guys.

491
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,300
And be like...

492
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,780
No guys, you're gonna expect so many different things.

493
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,600
Go in there expecting 80%.

494
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Actually not even 80%.

495
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,480
Go in there expecting 90% will be Marvel Rivals.

496
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,460
And then maybe a bonus chatting in there.

497
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,300
I'll just be like Twitch stream.

498
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,980
And then like you go in there.

499
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,220
It's just Marvel Rivals.

500
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,600
And then maybe like not 1% like Roblox.

501
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,020
Not addicted.

502
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,920
So that's basically it.

503
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,700
What else did I want to update you guys about?

504
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
Oh yeah, so the reason why I was late.

505
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,680
A little bit late.

506
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,200
My TikTok is now run by one of my mods.

507
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,800
Because I can't do it myself anymore.

508
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,620
Because I have so many other things to do.

509
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,600
Same with uploading shorts.

510
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,940
One of my mods.

511
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,100
I have a mod that's in charge.

512
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,560
Of uploading shorts.

513
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,040
And my TikTok stuff.

514
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,440
So my TikToks are like behind.

515
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
When it comes to shorts.

516
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,320
So like I haven't been looking at my TikTok account.

517
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,280
For basically a while now.

518
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,460
So like maybe like 2 or 3 months.

519
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,320
So I was checking up on it today.

520
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,500
I was like checking up like the view count.

521
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,180
I was like oh wait that TikTok got a lot of views.

522
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,040
I was like oh that's pretty interesting.

523
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,860
So I was just watching my...

524
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,920
I was just...

525
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Because they were old TikToks too.

526
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,200
It was old TikToks.

527
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,500
So I was just like re-watching it.

528
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,780
And I was like woah.

529
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,120
Oh my god.

530
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,420
I remember this moment.

531
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,140
I was like man I'm pretty fucking funny.

532
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,980
I was like oh I still have like 3 minutes left.

533
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,010
I still have 3 minutes before it's 5pm.

534
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,920
Let me watch my own TikToks.

535
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,020
And see what's going on.

536
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,540
And I was just like wow.

537
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,960
Pretty fucking funny.

538
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,840
So...

539
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,600
So...

540
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,240
And then I looked up.

541
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,800
I think I watched like 3 videos.

542
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,660
I looked at my clock and I saw 5.02.

543
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,320
And I was like oh fuck.

544
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,060
Okay sorry.

545
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,780
Talking about self love.

546
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,780
Oh my god.

547
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,760
So that's why I was late.

548
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,540
I was literally just watching myself.

549
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,920
Anyway.

550
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,400
Thank you for the super chat.

551
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,700
Thank you.

552
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,220
Thank you.

553
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,480
Thank you.

554
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,840
Thank you.

555
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,040
Thank you.

556
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,720
Thank you.

557
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,380
Thank you.

558
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,940
Slowly but surely.

559
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm getting there.

560
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,580
I also have like...

561
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,820
2025.

562
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
I'm starting to delegate more and more stuff.

563
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,480
So like contacting...

564
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,100
Well I still contact artists myself.

565
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,440
Because there's like ideas I want to do.

566
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,780
Especially Japanese artists.

567
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,780
But I do have like a...

568
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,040
Japanese translator.

569
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,740
So I have a staff member that does...

570
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,860
Japanese translations for me.

571
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,060
And helps me translate...

572
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,580
Emails and stuff for me.

573
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,380
And helps me talk to my mama.

574
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,400
And stuff like that.

575
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,300
But at first it was just me handling the emails myself.

576
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,200
And then me just copying and pasting it.

577
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,700
To my Japanese translator.

578
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,740
But like in 2025.

579
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,860
Starting 2025.

580
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,060
I've asked the translator to make an email.

581
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,240
So like...

582
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,340
Because I couldn't keep up with it anymore.

583
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,500
I couldn't keep up.

584
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,780
Because I know some people were like...

585
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,060
Oh your mama added you to respond to something.

586
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,540
And that was my bad.

587
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,820
Because I haven't been checking my emails regularly.

588
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,560
So like they wanted me to respond to something.

589
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,580
Regarding like something in the future.

590
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,700
And then so like...

591
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,580
So I asked my...

592
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,540
I asked my...

593
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,700
Translator.

594
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,660
To create an email.

595
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,900
And so like...

596
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,880
They basically in every interaction.

597
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,120
They CC.

598
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,900
They CC.

599
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,540
My translator.

600
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,080
So that they would let me know.

601
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
Whenever I get a response.

602
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,380
They would post a translation for me.

603
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,620
And then...

604
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,220
They post a translation for me.

605
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,040
And then I just reply back.

606
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,400
And then they respond it for me.

607
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,140
So it's a lot easier now.

608
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,180
Because like now I don't have to look at my email everyday.

609
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,540
As my translator gets all the emails.

610
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,880
That regarding like Japanese emails.

611
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,400
So then now I'm reminded.

612
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
By my Japanese translator.

613
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,340
If I have to reply to anything.

614
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,320
Thank you for the super chat Gambit.

615
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,000
Thank you, thank you.

616
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,460
Finally got my New Year's merch.

617
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:16,900
Yeah!

618
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm so happy!

619
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,980
A lot of the limited edition bundles.

620
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,640
Are finally being...

621
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,840
Received.

622
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,160
By you guys.

623
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,760
After like...

624
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,620
7 to 8 plus...

625
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

626
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,240
I'm so happy.

627
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
It's getting fixed everybody.

628
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,920
It's...

629
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,720
Everything's getting fixed.

630
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,260
Yay!

631
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,940
And apparently...

632
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,560
We might have...

633
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,700
Thank you for the raid Poseidon.

634
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,940
I really appreciate it.

635
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,460
And also...

636
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,680
We will have...

637
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,360
I won't say will.

638
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,160
But because we had like cancellations.

639
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,300
And people getting refunds.

640
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,320
Because it took so long.

641
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,920
But I did sign 200 plus postcards.

642
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,300
So like...

643
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,620
I did sign 200 plus postcards.

644
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,760
So if we do have any extras.

645
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,300
We will put the extras out.

646
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,340
The extra bundles.

647
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,940
Limited edition bundles out.

648
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,420
For people if they still want it.

649
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,660
So yeah.

650
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,800
There might be a chance.

651
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,340
That...

652
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,740
You will have a chance to still get the limited edition.

653
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,740
Bundles and stuff.

654
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,380
Because we might still have them in stock.

655
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,320
Since we didn't sell.

656
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,220
If somebody refunded.

657
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,820
Or cancelled the order.

658
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,940
We will...

659
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,180
We might put it back up.

660
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,480
We didn't put it back up yet.

661
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,140
Because we were trying to fix our whole merch situation.

662
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,480
But it's fixed.

663
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,500
Everything is fixed now.

664
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,440
So there's still a chance to get the limited edition stuff.

665
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,080
I signed 200 postcards each bundle.

666
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,280
So like...

667
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,080
The Lunar and the Robobank bundle.

668
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,300
Each have 200 postcards each.

669
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,860
And I know that...

670
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,780
We got people who cancelled their order.

671
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,160
Or refunded because it was taking a while.

672
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,880
Which is understandable.

673
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,160
We were offering refunds.

674
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
So because of that.

675
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,120
When everybody receives their order.

676
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,240
We will put the remaining stock up.

677
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,400
When...

678
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,520
I'll announce it too.

679
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll give you guys a time slot.

680
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,340
Because I don't think it was a lot.

681
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,340
I think at best it was 20 or 30.

682
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,960
So...

683
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,400
If you guys...

684
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,280
If there's people that...

685
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,480
Really...

686
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,220
We'll know if we see the postcard number.

687
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,700
I saw some of the postcards.

688
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Went up to...

689
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,900
Someone received postcard number 157.

690
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,040
I think they packaged it.

691
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,500
They just went by order.

692
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,660
Whatever is the maximum number.

693
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,380
That somebody received.

694
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,820
Then we have X amount left.

695
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,780
So I don't know.

696
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,620
I actually asked about it.

697
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,180
If we have extras.

698
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,220
Could you let me know.

699
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,180
And we could put it back up for sale.

700
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,680
Or something.

701
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,020
I'm just happy that things are being fixed now.

702
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,880
Just existing.

703
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,780
Thank you for the super chat.

704
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,800
Cosmic, thank you for the super chat.

705
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
I'll put number 5.

706
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,440
Not today!

707
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
Today is a chill day.

708
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,220
Thank you for the super chat.

709
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,540
I actually debated.

710
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
If I wanted to...

711
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,560
I numbered each postcard.

712
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,520
If you were the first one.

713
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,980
To order the bundle.

714
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,840
You get postcard number 1.

715
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,800
It is numbered.

716
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

717
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,080
It's first come first serve.

718
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,820
Whoever is the fastest to order.

719
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
They get the newer postcard.

720
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,940
The more recent numbers.

721
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,740
The lowest numbers.

722
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,580
Anyway.

723
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,620
I was given a choice.

724
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,180
To stream the early access.

725
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,080
Yesterday.

726
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,740
I thought about doing it today.

727
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,560
To try out the new Fantastic 4.

728
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,520
There's gonna be 4 new characters.

729
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,860
That's coming out for season 1.

730
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,680
I was given the option.

731
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,640
To stream that.

732
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,420
I forgot.

733
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,240
I was part of the Marvel Rivals Discord server.

734
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,260
I forgot about it.

735
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,860
How is everybody getting access.

736
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,880
To the fucking...

737
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,540
I'm not sponsored.

738
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,980
How is everybody getting access.

739
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
To the early access.

740
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,320
I'm not.

741
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,160
I was like, wait a minute.

742
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,020
I'm part of the Marvel Rivals server.

743
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,420
I was like, wait a minute.

744
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
I have access to the channels.

745
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
To the streamer channel.

746
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,880
Yesterday.

747
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,640
I looked at the channel.

748
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,460
I was like, claim your early access account.

749
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,160
Here.

750
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,080
I was like, wait a minute.

751
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,760
I can claim this.

752
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,960
I was like, download early access server.

753
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,480
Here.

754
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,940
If you wanna try it out.

755
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,680
I was like, oh my god.

756
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,900
Wait, I can do that?

757
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,940
Anyway, I was given.

758
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,900
I had the account.

759
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,200
To do early access.

760
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,100
But I chose not to.

761
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,260
Because I was like.

762
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,160
No.

763
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,300
I promise that I will stop.

764
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,260
I was like.

765
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,580
Because I wanted to check out season 1 anyway.

766
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,200
On YouTube.

767
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
So I was like, I can't.

768
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,100
Because then there will be two.

769
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,040
Marvel Rivals YouTube streams.

770
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,400
And it will just be the same thing.

771
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,400
Because I was like.

772
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,440
If I do early access on YouTube.

773
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,380
Then I'm literally just replaying the early access.

774
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,600
But it won't be early access anymore.

775
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,880
It will just be the launch.

776
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,900
So I made the very tough decision.

777
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,940
To restrain myself.

778
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,760
Because I was going to stream season 1 anyway.

779
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,940
But if I do early access.

780
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,500
It's literally just going to be the same thing.

781
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,480
It's just.

782
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,560
Now instead of early access.

783
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,460
Everybody can play it.

784
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,400
So I was like.

785
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,620
No Ducky, you can't.

786
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,900
You already did so many.

787
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
I can't.

788
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,700
I have to just do one.

789
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
I don't need it.

790
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,540
I don't need it.

791
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,300
So.

792
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,980
So yeah.

793
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,800
I was given the chance to.

794
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,320
But I decided to restrain myself.

795
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,120
Until one in the.

796
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,900
Why the.

797
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
Okay I understand why.

798
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,560
Because the game isn't made in NA.

799
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,340
But still I'm like.

800
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,740
Why does the season.

801
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,780
Start at 1 AM.

802
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,180
The season.

803
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,160
Ends and starts.

804
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,380
At 1 AM.

805
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,840
That's so fucked up for me.

806
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,660
But like I understand.

807
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,860
Because not.

808
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,180
The game isn't made in NA.

809
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,480
But still.

810
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,280
Why wasn't it made for me.

811
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,220
And the game is made by NetEase.

812
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,860
And if you google NetEase.

813
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,360
They are on the other side of the world.

814
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,620
So yeah.

815
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,080
So yeah.

816
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,860
Season tomorrow.

817
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,120
It's basically on Friday at 1 AM.

818
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,820
But like it's basically tomorrow guys.

819
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,120
It's literally tomorrow.

820
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,720
Red Crow.

821
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,580
Thank you for the super chat.

822
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:37,880
Thank you.

823
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,380
Hey look dad came back with the milk.

824
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,420
And I came here with your new step mom.

825
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,080
Meet Marvel.

826
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,900
Say hello to your new step mom.

827
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,120
What do you mean Apex let home.

828
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,640
Sorry son.

829
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,940
I hate to tell.

830
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,600
Let you know.

831
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,380
That this is how.

832
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,880
That's crazy.

833
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,180
No.

834
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,780
It's okay.

835
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,780
It's okay son.

836
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,020
You get two birthdays.

837
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You get.

838
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,020
You get two.

839
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,460
Yay two Christmases.

840
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:16,840
Wow.

841
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,340
Son.

842
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,900
Don't you.

843
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,780
Apex wasn't even your first mom.

844
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,940
You already forgot your first mom.

845
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,780
Oh sorry.

846
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,640
I wasn't talking about you son.

847
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,200
Your half.

848
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,880
Sorry your half brother.

849
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,880
Half brother.

850
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,420
Sorry I forgot.

851
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,980
You came from Apex side.

852
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,960
Your half brother's first mom was Overwatch.

853
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:43,960
You.

854
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,560
Sorry about that.

855
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,020
Now you get to experience what your half brother experience.

856
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,320
Yay.

857
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,300
Well.

858
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,020
If you look at the family tree.

859
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,080
Technically.

860
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,680
The Bark Knights were the first son.

861
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,400
And the original mom was Overwatch.

862
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,720
Then I divorced her.

863
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,280
And then we got together with Apex.

864
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,760
And then you were born.

865
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,580
And then.

866
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,000
But you have a half brother.

867
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,620
You have your half brother here.

868
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,540
And then.

869
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,180
You thought we were just taking time off.

870
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,680
We were getting couples counseling and all that stuff.

871
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,340
She doesn't live here anymore.

872
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,300
But don't worry.

873
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,280
We're just working things out.

874
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:28,920
But no.

875
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
Meet your new step mom.

876
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,040
Meet your new step mom.

877
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,340
And your new half brother from Twitch.

878
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,600
It's complicated.

879
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,160
That's wild.

880
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,260
Put her.

881
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,300
By the way.

882
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,400
You have a new brother.

883
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,900
I got him on Twitch.

884
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,480
Jesus Christ.

885
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,620
The Lord.

886
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,080
Hey guys.

887
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,980
Thank you for the super chat.

888
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,300
Thank you.

889
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,280
Good morning from Maya in the world.

890
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,540
It was my birthday yesterday.

891
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,180
So I wanted to ask in my top 500 cameo.

892
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,600
If she could sing happy birthday to me.

893
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Of course I can.

894
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,440
Happy birthday to you.

895
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,280
Happy birthday to you.

896
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,540
Happy birthday dear hey guys.

897
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,020
Happy birthday to you.

898
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,700
Yeah.

899
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,780
Happy birthday.

900
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,820
So I'm an apex.

901
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,360
Your first mom.

902
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,020
Oh yeah.

903
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,320
That's like your first mom's half sister.

904
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:31,920
You're right.

905
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,940
Welcome to your new.

906
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,800
Finally I have a brother.

907
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,440
Yay guys.

908
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,960
Now you get to have a brother.

909
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,420
Aren't you excited?

910
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,920
Aren't you?

911
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,060
What about the fort?

912
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,520
We don't talk.

913
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,620
We don't talk about your fort.

914
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,380
The fortnite dragoon that's living in the attic.

915
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,320
It's like that Bart Simpsons.

916
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,160
It's like that treehouse of horror.

917
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,700
Where you find out Bart Simpson has like.

918
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:01,900
A treehouse of horror.

919
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,680
And he's like an evil twin.

920
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,460
But he was actually the evil twin.

921
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,580
But he lives in the attic.

922
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,540
That's the fortnite dragoon.

923

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,180

00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,620
But they come from tiktoks.

934
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,580

So much.

938
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,300
I don't understand.

939
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,020
I guess it's because it's like.

940
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,480
It's very catchy.

941
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,200
But it's literally that part.

942
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,200
That's catchy.

943
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,640
But it's like cringe keno.

Everybody's like obsessed with.

That specific part.

960
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,960
I see so many videos about it.

961
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,600
Uh.

962
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,180

Everyone's like oh my god that song is so good.

964
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,240
Oh my god.

965
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,180
But literally it's that part.

966
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,740
Everyone just remembers that part.

967
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,420
I watched like.

968
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,680
The entire song.

969
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,700
Cause like Disney uploaded the video.

970
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,680
Like Disney uploaded the video.

971
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,560
The full song.

972
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,880
So I watched it.

973
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,660
And I legitimately don't remember any of the verses.

974
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,900
But like.

975
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,440
I've always wanted a brother.

976
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,300
That's not as straight as my brother.

977
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,920
That's the only part I remember.

978
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,100
But like.

979
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,260
There's a whole.

980
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,440
There's a different lines and melodies.

981
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,700
In that song.

982
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,880
There's so much more to that song.

983
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,780
But I only remember that part.

984
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,020
Um.

985
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,860
If you were like.

986
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,280
Well you know what's fucked up?

987
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,300
I saw that.

988
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:15,900
Apparently.

989
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,040
The movie.

990
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,540
What was it?

991
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,160
Mufasa.

992
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,260
Lion King 2.

993
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,080
I don't remember.

994
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,840
Mufasa's story or whatever the fuck.

995
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,880
It's so fucked up that Scar was supposed to be the king.

996
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,420
And then like.

997
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,500
And then Mufasa just shows up.

998
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:30,980
And was like.

999
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,440
Hey.

1000
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,840
Like he's literally the random in the story.

1001
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,280
It's so fucked up.

1002
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,840
Anyway.

1003
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,380
What's fucked up was I heard that.

1004
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,540
Um.

1005
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,780
I heard that like.

1006
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,800
Mufasa the movie.

1007
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,480
Got nominated for several awards.

1008
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,540
And I'm like.

1009
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,700
How?

1010
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,200
And one of them was for like.

1011
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,780
Voice acting.

1012
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,960
But like.

1013
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,160
What's crazy is that.

1014
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,440
Transformer 1 didn't get nominated.

1015
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,360
At all.

1016
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,340
For voice acting.

1017
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Or like anything.

1018
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,120
Which I personally thought that was incredibly rigged.

1019
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,080
I was like.

1020
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,260
I was like.

1021
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,080
The Mufasa movie.

1022
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
Got nominated for like.

1023
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,940
Three voice acting awards.

1024
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,920
I was like.

1025
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,320
What?

1026
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,660
I was like.

1027
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,940
I finally watched Transformers 1.

1028
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't remember.

1029
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,380
I don't know if I told you guys that.

1030
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,820
But I finally watched Transformers 1 a couple of.

1031
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
I think like one or two months ago.

1032
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,600
And I don't remember if I like told you guys that.

1033
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,460
But like.

1034
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,680
It was really good.

1035
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,440
It was really good.

1036
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,620
And like.

1037
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,920
Also Starscream is a fucking freak.

1038
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
But like he's always a freak.

1039
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,020
But like I was.

1040
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,420
When like Megatron like stepped on him.

1041
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,400
And Starscream was like yeah come on.

1042
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,520
Do it yeah.

1043
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,220
And I'm like woah.

1044
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,040
Dave Buscemi bro.

1045
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,740
Steve Buscemi.

1046
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,720
Steve Buscemi.

1047
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,380
Oh my god.

1048
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,360
Mr. Buscemi.

1049
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,800
He's just like.

1050
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,500
Me.

1051
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,180
I don't know where Dave came from.

1052
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
But I was just like.

1053
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,960
Woah.

1054
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,540
He got really into that role.

1055
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,380
Yeah.

1056
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,420
Yeah.

1057
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,820
It's like there was one scene.

1058
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,640
For those who never watched Transformers 1.

1059
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,260
So the whole reason why Starscream.

1060
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,040
Has a voice that he has.

1061
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,100
Where he's like you know very screechy.

1062
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,760
And it's because.

1063
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,320
His vocal box.

1064
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,460
Like gets crushed.

1065
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
By Megatron.

1066
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,540
In like a 1v1.

1067
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,360
But like a lot of different.

1068
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
Movies and TV show adaptation.

1069
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,260
Does it differently.

1070
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,080
So.

1071
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
So in Transformers 1.

1072
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,500
Starscream and Megatron.

1073
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,800
You know fight each other.

1074
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,540
And then his voice box get crushed.

1075
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,780
Because Megatron started.

1076
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,440
Like choking him and stepping on him.

1077
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,160
And then Starscream was like.

1078
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,120
Sort of really into it.

1079
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,320
I was like woah.

1080
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,320
Woah Mr. Buscemi.

1081
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,660
Cause like you know that's his voice too.

1082
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,880
So I'm like oh my god.

1083
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,420
Yeah.

1084
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,980
I'm like damn.

1085
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,780
He's 67 years old.

1086
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,280
But he still got it.

1087
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,140
He still.

1088
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,420
He still got it.

1089
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,020
And then after that Starscream was like.

1090
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,060
My leader.

1091
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,900
Yeah.

1092
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,760
Why you judging me.

1093
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,860
Like I was judging him.

1094
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,000
Why you judging.

1095
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,700
That's literally what happens in the movie.

1096
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,740
I'm literally telling you guys.

1097
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,280
I was like.

1098
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,340
Bro like.

1099
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,280
You guys didn't have to go that hard on that part.

1100
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,080
Cause it was like.

1101
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,580
It was weird.

1102
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,040
That's why I'm.

1103
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,360
That's why I'm talking about it.

1104
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,800
It was like weird.

1105
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,760
There was no other motive.

1106
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,640
For me to talk about it.

1107
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,400
I'm not a freak.

1108
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1109
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,660
Thank you.

1110
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,980
I can't believe Starscream became a squeaker IRL.

1111
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,620
Because he was a freak.

1112
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,480
Thank you for the super chat.

1113
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:39,920
Thank you.

1114
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,240
Oh shit.

1115
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,000
Let me reply to this message real quick.

1116
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,000
So apparently Zentraya might be organizing a Marvel Rivals tournament.

1117
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,080
And I asked if I could like.

1118
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,260
Get a spot.

1119
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,720
So I'm just replying back.

1120
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,380
So.

1121
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,780
Give me a sec.

1122
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,760
I'm not sure if it's actually going to be finalized.

1123
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,280
But they were like.

1124
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,240
Oh yeah we'll keep you in mind.

1125
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,240
So I was like.

1126
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,200
Yippee.

1127
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,180
A lot of people are super severely obsessed.

1128
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,700
And addicted to Marvel Rivals.

1129
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,520
So like.

1130
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,260
Sorry I can't multitask anymore.

1131
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,800
My mind is just like.

1132
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,000
One way.

1133
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,540
I want to say if I could have Mac on my team.

1134
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,960
Because we played a lot together.

1135
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,130
Will it be fair?

1136
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,270
I don't know.

1137
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,150
That's insane.

1138
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,190
I'm just thinking like.

1139
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,730
Will it be fair?

1140
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,350
I don't know.

1141
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,910
But I would like to have Mac on my team.

1142
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,930
We don't know that.

1143
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:08,810
We don't.

1144
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,670
Technically I could also drag Surefour into this too.

1145
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,210
You don't know that.

1146
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,950
You don't know that.

1147
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,630
I still need to find a tank player.

1148
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,030
I still need to find a tank.

1149
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,370
When like another DPS.

1150
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,510
And another support.

1151
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,210
You don't know that.

1152
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,830
We all know.

1153
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,710
We all know.

1154
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,290
You don't know that.

1155
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,610
Oh my god.

1156
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,030
I could have SK too.

1157
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:38,910
You're right.

1158
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,550
Let's just make this a fast one boys.

1159
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,970
I'm min maxing.

1160
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,610
I'm a min max this channel.

1161
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,810
But let me get Surefour, SK, Mac, me.

1162
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,810
Alright.

1163
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,410
Now I just need two tank players.

1164
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,010
And let me buy a Vtuber skin soon.

1165
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,890
For a tank player.

1166
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,190
It will be great.

1167
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,470
Now that's just unfair.

1168
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,850
I'm building a team.

1169
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:09,650
Guys.

1170
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,690
Avengers assembled.

1171
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,510
Everybody.

1172
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,110
Everybody.

1173
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,290
The dream team.

1174
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,550
Anyway.

1175
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,090
Where was I?

1176
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,390
I'm glad to be back though.

1177
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,870
It's nice to just like yap with you guys.

1178
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,710
And just chill out.

1179
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,690
I really hope it doesn't climb up.

1180
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,510
I'm so scared.

1181
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,810
I was actually so nervous yesterday.

1182
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:40,570
Like today.

1183
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,390
This morning.

1184
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,850
Two days ago.

1185
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,510
The number was at 190 something.

1186
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,310
And now it's at 229.

1187
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:51,890
I think.

1188
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,210
And I'm just so scared.

1189
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,210
I'm so scared.

1190
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,750
I'm just worried.

1191
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,410
If I do have to play it.

1192
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,170
A couple more games.

1193
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,290
I'm going to do it off stream.

1194
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,570
Because I'm so tired of getting stream sniped.

1195
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:10,750
Especially when the odds are this high now.

1196
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,570
And I'll record the session too.

1197
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,110
For those who didn't know.

1198
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,910
At one point I was getting stream sniped.

1199
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,710
By the winners of the tournament.

1200
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,550
Of the Marvel Rivals Tournament.

1201
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:24,730
And I'm like.

1202
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,050
You already won.

1203
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,830
I was just like.

1204
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,610
You already won.

1205
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,310
What do you want?

1206
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:34,690
I'm like.

1207
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,190
You're right.

1208
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,050
You won it all.

1209
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,310
That's fine.

1210
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,050
That's fine.

1211
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,510
And then I found out.

1212
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,630
They were not just stream sniping me.

1213
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,170
They were stream sniping the players.

1214
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,210
I was playing with.

1215
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,870
I was talking to them.

1216
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,150
They were like.

1217
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,050
They usually stream snipe us.

1218
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:54,070
When they see us stacking.

1219
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,430
I'm like.

1220
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,670
But like.

1221
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,090
I'm there.

1222
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:00,570
They're like.

1223
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,910
They saw us making a stack.

1224
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,330
So they got their own stack.

1225
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,790
To snipe us.

1226
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,730
I'm like.

1227
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,590
What?

1228
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,930
I'm a make a wish.

1229
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,870
I'm a make a wish.

1230
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,090
What do you mean?

1231
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,290
I got caught in the crossfire.

1232
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,950
I literally.

1233
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,250
I was just caught in that.

1234
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,070
Crossfire snipe.

1235
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,970
You got dragged into the storm.

1236
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,990
So I was just like.

1237
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,270
That's fucked man.

1238
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,030
They knew I was the weakest link too.

1239
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,750
Because I got.

1240
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,930
I got so targeted.

1241
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,850
Against those.

1242
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,390
Against the top 10 stacks.

1243
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,310
And the tournament winning stacks.

1244
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,210
Because they knew.

1245
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,390
I was the weakest link.

1246
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,890
I was like please.

1247
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:03,210
Please.

1248
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,930
I'm just a child.

1249
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,350
What's wrong with you guys?

1250
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,830
I'm just a child.

1251
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,670
It's over.

1252
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,990
Guys it's over.

1253
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,850
I'm not going to be as crazy for season 1.

1254
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:23,470
I promise.

1255
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,770
I literally only get super obsessive.

1256
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,270
In the very first season of rank.

1257
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,710
Because I just want to get it.

1258
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,790
I feel like.

1259
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,390
Especially in season 0.

1260
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,470
It's like the most prolific season.

1261
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,810
Since it's the first one.

1262
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,470
And everybody is playing it.

1263
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,050
Everybody is grinding it.

1264
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,090
It's so much more competitive.

1265
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,790
Compared to any other season.

1266
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,330
So that's why I'm like.

1267
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:46,990
Oh my god.

1268
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,970
I have to get it for this season.

1269
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,990
Because it's the most bragging rights.

1270
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,630
20 years will pass.

1271
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,970
And I'll be like.

1272
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,490
Dragons remember when I got top 500.

1273
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,930
In season 0.

1274
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,310
That's right.

1275
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,310
Just like how I got top 500.

1276
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,650
In season 4 of Apex Legends.

1277
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,270
When it was so competitive.

1278
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,710
That's right.

1279
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,350
That was me.

1280
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,750
I'm sure.

1281
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,370
That's really it.

1282
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,670
Anyone buying this.

1283
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:25,470
Oh my god.

1284
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,930
For members.

1285
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,570
Members goons out there.

1286
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,550
Sorry you guys haven't got the December wallpaper yet.

1287
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,350
For your members wallpaper.

1288
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,730
It's gonna be coming soon.

1289
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,170
As in like.

1290
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,910
Maybe this week.

1291
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:44,850
Or next week.

1292
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,130
And January wallpaper.

1293
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,730
Is gonna be in March.

1294
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,970
Because I was late.

1295
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,030
When I couldn't reply.

1296
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:54,990
I wasn't replying to emails.

1297
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,230
So I was late on replying on a deadline.

1298
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:58,730
And so like.

1299
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,410
The artist was like.

1300
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,090
I can't finish this by January.

1301
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,110
So I'm gonna finish this by March.

1302
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,430
And I'm like that's alright.

1303
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,990
So you're gonna get two wallpapers.

1304
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:09,550
On March.

1305
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:10,210
So.

1306
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,790
One of the March wallpapers.

1307
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,790
Is gonna be New Years themed.

1308
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:15,730
And.

1309
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,670
Because of that.

1310
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,430
You won't get a January wallpaper.

1311
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,830
It'll just be like a little surprise.

1312
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,670
I can show you guys the preview of it.

1313
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,070
I usually show the concept art.

1314
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,290
The concept outfit.

1315
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:32,970
For the wallpapers to the public.

1316
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,430
So it's not like I'm leaking members content.

1317
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,890
But if you guys want the wallpapers.

1318
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,930
You can join the membership.

1319
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:41,690
Yay.

1320
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,750
Alright let me see if I can find it.

1321
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,690
I need to find the.

1322
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,790
The email for it though.

1323
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:50,890
Nope.

1324
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,190
That's the Valentine's wallpaper.

1325
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,590
Oh.

1326
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:55,770
Woah.

1327
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,470
That's the Valentine's one.

1328
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,090
That's not the.

1329
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,410
That's not the December one.

1330
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:03,950
Woah.

1331
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:08,850
Hint hint.

1332
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,310
Yeah.

1333
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,210
There might be a.

1334
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:13,970
You know.

1335
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,690
You know.

1336
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,310
Valentine's wallpaper too.

1337
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:20,550
Alright.

1338
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,470
Oh shit okay.

1339
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,510
We'll use that one.

1340
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,910
Alright so this is the concept outfit.

1341
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,710
For the wallpaper.

1342
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:30,930
I thought it was really cute.

1343
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:31,550
I'm actually.

1344
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,630
It's also going to be a sneak preview for a.

1345
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,510
Also Reggie.

1346
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,770
Welcome to tomato farm.

1347
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,330
Thank you for 10 gifted ships.

1348
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,550
I almost said subs.

1349
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,610
I'm so used to saying subs.

1350
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,830
On twitch.

1351
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,110
10 gifted ships.

1352
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:49,850
But.

1353
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,230
Woah.

1354
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,430
So.

1355
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,130
I thought it was super cute.

1356
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,090
I thought this outfit was super cute.

1357
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,290
With the sweater and the little tomato hat.

1358
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,210
So I'm actually.

1359
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,010
I really love the Christmas sweater.

1360
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,050
And the tomato hat so much.

1361
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,490
I actually asked.

1362
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:08,310
If we could.

1363
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,250
If I could use this concept design.

1364
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,630
And make it into an actual sweater.

1365
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:14,510
So.

1366
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,870
This sweater you see there.

1367
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,330
Is going to be a future merch.

1368
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,470
For winter.

1369
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,730
And I feel like.

1370
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,350
If I do pre-orders for it.

1371
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,930
In the beginning of the year.

1372
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,770
Then you guys might be able to get this sweater.

1373
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,230
By winter.

1374
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,270
I hope.

1375
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,810
I'm going to be in talks with our new distributor.

1376
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:35,970
To see if we can get this sweater.

1377
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,510
Pre-orders out.

1378
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,690
In the beginning of the year.

1379
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,790
So you guys can get it.

1380
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,230
And look there's dad with his little hat and scarf.

1381
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,250
I thought it was so cute.

1382
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,770
I really love the outfit.

1383
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,250
But yes, this is going to be the theme for the wallpaper.

1384
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,030
That I'm going to be putting in members.

1385
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:54,770
This month.

1386
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:55,670
Or this week.

1387
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,790
Hey guys, I'll be right back real quick.

1388
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,790
I need to get tissue box.

1389
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,750
Because I ran out of tissues.

1390
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:01,710
And I need to blow my nose.

1391
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,350
I'll be right back.

1392
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,050
I'm back.

1393
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,110
Cosmic.

1394
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,590
Thank you for the super chat.

1395
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,970
Thank you, thank you.

1396
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,170
Cosmic, Medi, Bite Size, Cas.

1397
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,570
Thank you, thank you, Cas.

1398
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,790
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1399
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:09,830
Welcome, welcome.

1400
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,170
But yeah, it's been a lot.

1401
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,310
It's been a lot of stuff going on.

1402
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,930
Oh my god, did you see that?

1403
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:18,830
Okay.

1404
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,710
Oh my god.

1405
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,650
You know what's crazy?

1406
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,670
Okay, I'm sorry I keep talking about my rivals.

1407
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,010
I'm sorry.

1408
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,550
The YouTube goons were like.

1409
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,650
I thought we would get other stuff.

1410
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,150
I thought you were going to talk about other things.

1411
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,030
But like, apparently I found out that.

1412
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,750
I don't know if you guys know TimTheTatman.

1413
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,430
But he's like super OG.

1414
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,970
He's a super OG streamer.

1415
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,270
And like, he apparently was spectating.

1416
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,610
One of my games.

1417
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,110
I found, somebody told me.

1418
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,370
He was spectating.

1419
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,430
Like, one of the games that I had.

1420
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,590
Because he was spectating a top 500 Hulk player.

1421
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:04,830
And like.

1422
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,130
A hulk player.

1423
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,850
A hulk was playing against my team.

1424
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,390
We lost against that hulk player.

1425
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,490
But like, he was gassing me up.

1426
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,030
He was like, oh my god.

1427
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:14,650
That Luna.

1428
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,730
She's so good.

1429
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,630
She saved this entire team.

1430
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,570
We gotta appreciate this Luna.

1431
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,070
And I'm like, finally.

1432
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:24,490
Vindication.

1433
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,670
I'm not that bad.

1434
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,690
I'm just like.

1435
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,190
Oh my god.

1436
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:33,990
Finally.

1437
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,070
I belong here.

1438
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,910
I actually belong here.

1439
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,690
I was so happy.

1440
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,770
I was like, oh my god.

1441
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,390
Ego boost.

1442
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,050
God.

1443
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,430
Bro, Tim doesn't need to be paid.

1444
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,310
He's a fucking millionaire.

1445
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:00,870
Man.

1446
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:03,850
He's been doing that content creation shit.

1447
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:04,530
For like.

1448
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,030
I bet Blizzard paid him like.

1449
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,270
A million dollars.

1450
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:09,930
Before he left.

1451
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,450
He went on YouTube.

1452
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,570
He used to stream on YouTube.

1453
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,730
You think he didn't get the fucking.

1454
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:18,830
Did you know.

1455
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,490
What's his name?

1456
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:20,750
Myth got paid like.

1457
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,210
How many millions?

1458
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:25,110
He said he got paid like 11 million dollars.

1459
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,730
To stream on YouTube exclusively.

1460
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:28,330
Right?

1461
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,790
Is that what he said?

1462
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:30,950
I don't remember.

1463
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,610
I remember it was like.

1464
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,950
4 million.

1465
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:34,570
Yeah.

1466
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:38,030
Myth got paid 4 million dollars.

1467
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,530
To stream exclusive.

1468
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,310
Where's my 4 million dollars?

1469
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,330
Maybe I should fucking.

1470
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,410
Don't care.

1471
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,930
You're trying to threaten YouTube.

1472
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:50,190
All I'm saying is that.

1473
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:54,430
Myth got paid 4 million dollars.

1474
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,630
To stream exclusively on YouTube.

1475
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:58,850
And like.

1476
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,210
He fucking like.

1477
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,370
He like.

1478
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,290
Left.

1479
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,410
And he came back after the contract ended.

1480
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,210
He came back to Twitch after the contract ended.

1481
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:08,790
Like.

1482
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:09,290
What?

1483
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,110
Where's my bag?

1484
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,770
And I'm like.

1485
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,010
All I'm saying is that.

1486
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,650
If Myth gets.

1487
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,930
You may be entitled.

1488
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,710
To 4 million dollars.

1489
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,450
Thank you for the super chat.

1490
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:28,830
Thank you.

1491
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:31,390
All I'm saying is.

1492
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,030
If Myth gets 4 million dollars.

1493
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,490
Then that means.

1494
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,110
Tim would have got like.

1495
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,450
So much more.

1496
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,130
There's no way he did not get more than that.

1497
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,620
There's no fucking way.

1498
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,700
If I ever got a mixer deal.

1499
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,840
I would have been set for life.

1500
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,560
I would not have cared about it.

1501
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,200
That's when I had like no more.

1502
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,160
I would not have to care about anything else.

1503
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:03,920
After that.

1504
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,500
I could literally do any.

1505
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,460
I could just like.

1506
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,880
Fund as many things as I wanted.

1507
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,360
I'd build my own fucking 3D studio.

1508
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,700
If I could.

1509
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,240
I could have like.

1510
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,580
I could have had my own fucking 3D studio.

1511
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,300
Not like literally like an entire warehouse.

1512
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,240
Of just 3D technology.

1513
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,800
If I could get fun.

1514
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,660
If I could get an exclusive contract.

1515
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,080
I would actually.

1516
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,480
Cause like that easily could have paid for like.

1517
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,540
So many 3D cameras.

1518
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,860
And I could just fucking.

1519
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,480
Rent a warehouse for that shit.

1520
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,540
I'll just like.

1521
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,420
I'll just rent my own warehouse.

1522
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,220
And then like.

1523
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,760
I'll outsource it to other VTubers.

1524
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,160
Who want to do 3D.

1525
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,460
And then like I'm like.

1526
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,460
I'm coming for you.

1527
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,120
What is it?

1528
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,080
Cause like currently like.

1529
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,860
I think it's like.

1530
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,620
Brave group owns like the best.

1531
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,680
NA 3D studio.

1532
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,520
At the moment.

1533
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,880
So like.

1534
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:07,660
I'm coming.

1535
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,340
If I get my exclusive contract.

1536
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,100
I'm gonna be your competition.

1537
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,160
I'm gonna be your competition.

1538
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,600
And then I'll rent my studio.

1539
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,380
To other VTubers in NA.

1540
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,740
The 3D war begins now.

1541
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,520
But only if I get the exclusive contract.

1542
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,820
If I get the fucking.

1543
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,420
The 4 million dollars.

1544
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,980
Fucking exclusive contract.

1545
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,800
I'll begin the 3D wars.

1546
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:52,500
In NA.

1547
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,880
For VTubers.

1548
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,280
If I get the contract obviously.

1549
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,980
If I get it.

1550
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:02,880
LOL.

1551
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,580
So now.

1552
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,620
I'll make sure.

1553
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,200
I'll make sure it's not too weak.

1554
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,580
I'll purposely price it lower.

1555
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,560
Just like how.

1556
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,140
In the super stores.

1557
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,460
You know like.

1558
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,740
Markets and stuff.

1559
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,900
Walmart and Target.

1560
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,860
Competitive pricing.

1561
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,620
I'll do competitive pricing too.

1562
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,860
So I'll be like.

1563
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,220
They price that much.

1564
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,600
Mine's one cent cheaper.

1565
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,780
I'm gonna undercut it.

1566
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,200
I'll do competitive pricing.

1567
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,240
Just like Walmart.

1568
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,120
I'll be the Walmart to the Target.

1569
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,000
I'll be in the cutthroat economy.

1570
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,580
That one cent.

1571
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,400
Makes a huge difference.

1572
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,060
Cause it's like one cent less per hour.

1573
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:04,960
So like.

1574
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:05,900
Because of that.

1575
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,280
If it's like one cent less per hour.

1576
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,480
It adds up.

1577
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,020
You don't understand.

1578
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,960
I like how I'm like.

1579
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,520
Talking about this all hypothetically.

1580
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,960
As if it's actually gonna happen.

1581
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,620
Who the fuck is gonna give me 4 million dollars.

1582
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,900
Who the fuck is gonna.

1583
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,160
Who's gonna give me 4 million dollars.

1584
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,840
To stream on a platform I'm already streaming on.

1585
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,800
But what if it does.

1586
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:35,440
Alright.

1587
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,960
Streaming services.

1588
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,340
If you want me on for your exclusive platform.

1589
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,840
I want 4 million dollars.

1590
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,720
Nothing less.

1591
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,280
But it could be more obviously.

1592
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,840
I mean you know what.

1593
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,000
If you wanna be like nice and give me like 5 million.

1594
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,040
I won't say no.

1595
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,780
I won't say no though.

1596
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,640
Don't say that or you'll end up on kick.

1597
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,600
Alright kick.

1598
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,400
If you wanna buy me.

1599
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,280
It can't be an exclusive contract.

1600
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:10,780
I'm sorry.

1601
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,600
I'm sorry.

1602
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:15,380
But.

1603
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,380
But.

1604
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,200
But.

1605
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,400
But if you give me like 10 million dollars.

1606
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,280
Like not exclusive though.

1607
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,820
I'll take it.

1608
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,780
I'll add another 0 there.

1609
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,960
40 million.

1610
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,200
Guys.

1611
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,620
Think about it.

1612
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,820
I'll get a 3D studio.

1613
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,100
Guys.

1614
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,880
I'll get a 3D studio guys.

1615
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,100
Think about it.

1616
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,740
I'll stop.

1617
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,860
I'll still be on YouTube.

1618
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,180
I'll still be on YouTube.

1619
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,560
It's literally.

1620
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,020
It's the risk and rewards.

1621
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,460
I'll still be here.

1622
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,920
I'm unsubscribing.

1623
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,340
Guys.

1624
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,980
Think about it.

1625
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,860
Thank you.

1626
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,120
You're not pure anymore.

1627
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:16,520
Drops.

1628
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,320
You're not pure.

1629
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,240
I'm sorry Doki.

1630
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,100
But you're not pure anymore.

1631
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,840
You've been soiled.

1632
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,060
I'm sorry.

1633
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,320
I can't.

1634
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,220
I feel betrayed Doki.

1635
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,180
Guys it's not like it's gonna happen.

1636
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:35,960
Guys.

1637
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,740
10 million.

1638
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,940
You really think I'm gonna get 10 million dollars from kick?

1639
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,160
You really think so.

1640
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,680
Guys.

1641
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,820
I don't know how the fuck they have all that money to spend though.

1642
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,520
They've given so many exclusive deals.

1643
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,000
To so many streamers.

1644
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,780
I do not understand how.

1645
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:54,880
How.

1646
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,840
Profit wise.

1647
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,320
How it's working.

1648
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,120
Because Twitch is negative.

1649
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,640
Twitch is not even.

1650
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,100
Oh wait you're right.

1651
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,200
They allow GAM.

1652
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,760
I forgot about that.

1653
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,680
That's one of the biggest things.

1654
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,520
And porn too.

1655
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,400
At one point.

1656
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,560
I forgot they're funded by GAM casinos.

1657
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,620
Oh my god.

1658
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,960
I forgot about that.

1659
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,960
Oh they're owned by Steak?

1660
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,580
Oh my god.

1661
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Actually maybe I won't take them.

1662
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,840
Maybe.

1663
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:29,620
Okay.

1664
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,340
Alright.

1665
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,400
Yeah I'm not taking that money.

1666
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,300
I forgot they were owned by casinos.

1667
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,360
I had an offer.

1668
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,700
I had a casino offer one time.

1669
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,760
For my channel.

1670
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,220
Like for this channel.

1671
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,320
They tried to offer me a lot of money.

1672
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,660
To do like a gambling stream.

1673
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,000
And I was like.

1674
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,180
What.

1675
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:52,740
No.

1676
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,700
What the fuck.

1677
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:56,820
No.

1678
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,440
It was a lot.

1679
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,340
Let me just say.

1680
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,820
It was a lot of money.

1681
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,800
But like I was just like.

1682
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,080
No.

1683
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,980
I'm not gonna.

1684
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,060
They already have gotcha problems.

1685
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,120
They don't need real light world problems.

1686
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,300
Vtuber fans already have gotcha issues.

1687
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,420
I can't include gambling and casinos too.

1688
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,060
Like I remember someone was like.

1689
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,560
Debating about like.

1690
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,700
Well I saw like.

1691
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,960
Cause I talked about it before.

1692
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,800
I talked about it before.

1693
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,120
And they were like.

1694
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,980
Well why does Doki like.

1695
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,960
Accept gotcha sponsors.

1696
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,220
But not like casino gambling sponsors.

1697
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,520
Cause it's basically the same.

1698
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,200
It is not the same thing.

1699
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,820
I personally think.

1700
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,740
Gambling and gotcha.

1701
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,560
Is absolutely not the same thing.

1702
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,100
Because for gotcha.

1703
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,000
There's like.

1704
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,160
There's a cut off you know.

1705
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,180
There's like a.

1706
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,580
There's like a.

1707
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,760
Like.

1708
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,000
There's like a cut off.

1709
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,040
Of like when you.

1710
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,760
When it stops.

1711
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,080
Except when they release waifus.

1712
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,940
But then for gambling.

1713
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,720
There's no cut off.

1714
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,060
And there's no.

1715
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,980
You can keep doing that forever.

1716
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,060
And like.

1717
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,180
There's no like money cut off too.

1718
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,220
And.

1719
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,760
And like.

1720
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,380
I personally think it's not the same.

1721
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,880
Because like also for gotcha.

1722
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,180
Yeah it's endlessly draining.

1723
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,200
Your money.

1724
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,600
But like for gotcha.

1725
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,060
There's a limit to the waifus.

1726
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:45,520
There's.

1727
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,480
There's at least limits to the waifus.

1728
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,700
And then there's like.

1729
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,020
Pity system.

1730
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,280
There's a pity system in gotcha.

1731
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,300
But in casinos.

1732
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,260
I heard a lot of online gambling.

1733
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,300
Is actually essentially rigged too.

1734
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,440
And there's a lot.

1735
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,980
Online gambling is like incredibly rigged.

1736
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,100
To the house.

1737
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,180
Just like real life gambling.

1738
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,980
But like it's even more rigged.

1739
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,200
Because it's all on the algorithm.

1740
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,080
So like it's like.

1741
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,700
You're actually essentially there's like no.

1742
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,060
You're really like just losing everything.

1743
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,840
And uh.

1744
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,180
Slots have pity too.

1745
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,260
Are you trying?

1746
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,680
Slots have pity too.

1747
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:27,340
Okay.

1748
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,180
Um.

1749
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,220
But like.

1750
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,560
I don't think you realize.

1751
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,660
Um.

1752
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,140
How little you get from that pity.

1753
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,940
Hashtag.

1754
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,530
Gamble responsibly.

1755
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,040
Sponsored by steak.

1756
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,280
Who said that?

1757
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,260
Um.

1758
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,760
Um.

1759
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,420
Anyway.

1760
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,080
Um.

1761
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,620
But yeah.

1762
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,440
I think it's different.

1763
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,520
Between like.

1764
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,540
The fact for that one girl.

1765
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:13,040
Okay.

1766
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,760
I always remember that one story.

1767
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,580
Of the what was it?

1768
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,820
Genshin Impact girl.

1769
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,080
Who basically.

1770
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,540
There was a crowd fund.

1771
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,800
For a Genshin Impact.

1772
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:26,760
Vine.

1773
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,560
Or like what was it?

1774
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,660
Like a Genshin Impact.

1775
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,040
Book for artists.

1776
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,040
And then.

1777
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,220
So it raised up to like.

1778
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,820
It raised up to like.

1779
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,120
Thousands of dollars.

1780
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,600
Like 30k or something.

1781
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,040
What was it?

1782
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,980
Zine girl.

1783
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,980
I don't remember how much they raised.

1784
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,340
But it was like an art book.

1785
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,680
And they raised up like.

1786
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,000
30k plus.

1787
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,060
And then the project leader.

1788
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,140
Used up entire money.

1789
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,340
On Genshin Impact.

1790
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:01,200
Gacha.

1791
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,360
And it wasn't even for like.

1792
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,280
Waifus.

1793
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,020
It was for weapons.

1794
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,760
And I was like what the.

1795
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,140
What the.

1796
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:10,680
I was like.

1797
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,820
Oh my god.

1798
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,140
I was just like.

1799
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,680
It wasn't even.

1800
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,860
Yeah it was.

1801
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,760
Yeah they were.

1802
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,520
They were gachaing for the.

1803
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,300
The weapon gacha.

1804
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,220
And people were like.

1805
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,660
What the fuck.

1806
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,340
It wasn't even for the.

1807
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:33,020
It wasn't even for the waifus.

1808
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,580
It wasn't even for the characters.

1809
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,380
Oh my god.

1810
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,020
Yeah.

1811
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,900
So I was like.

1812
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,880
Don't do that though.

1813
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,740
That's like a casino right there.

1814
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,420
That's like a casino.

1815
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,860
Right there.

1816
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,280
It wasn't even for waifus or husbando.

1817
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,140
They just won a 5 star weapon for their favorite.

1818
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,820
For their favorite character.

1819
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,500
Yeah.

1820
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,240
I think that's the.

1821
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,480
The craziest story.

1822
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,140
I've ever read about gacha.

1823
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,640
So gacha is.

1824
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:12,540
Anyway.

1825
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,980
Oh yeah guys.

1826
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,340
Did you guys know this?

1827
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,000
I saw this pop up.

1828
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,900
On my feed today.

1829
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,380
I saw it pop up.

1830
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,080
But there was a.

1831
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,440
There was a.

1832
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,120
There's a school to learn how to be santa claus.

1833
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,500
And it's 500.

1834
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,540
It's 500 dollars.

1835
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,640
And I'm like.

1836
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,160
This feels like a.

1837
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,880
I don't know.

1838
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,680
This feels like a scam.

1839
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,580
Can I just watch a youtube video.

1840
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,180
On how to be santa.

1841
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,300
And apparently.

1842
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,300
It's one of the most.

1843
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,720
The biggest schools.

1844
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,580
To learn how to be santa claus.

1845
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,560
And.

1846
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,600
They teach you how to.

1847
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,480
Talk like santa.

1848
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,500

That's crazy.

2034
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,160
That's actually.

2035
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,080
That's actually crazy.

2036
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,500
I was so surprised.

2037
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,480
I did not realize.

2038
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,880
There's like the harvard of santa schools.

2039
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,860
I thought they were just actors.

2040
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,580
I didn't realize they live.

2041
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,180
Breathe and like.

2042
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,500
They live breathe and are santa.

2043
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,520
At that point.

2044
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:41,160
Like.

2045
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,920
The course is $580.

2046
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,180
Not bad.

2047
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:47,960
Yeah.

2048
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:52,060
But then you have to pay for hotels and travel costs.

2049
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,720
Cause it's in fucking.

2050
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:54,880
Okay.

2051
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,320
Let me look at where it was again.

2052
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,500
Cause when he said where it was.

2053
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:00,180
I was like who the fuck goes there for just santa.

2054
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,240
I need to look at it.

2055
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,280
I was like what?

2056
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,580
It's in Michigan.

2057
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,520
Midland Michigan.

2058
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,880
You have to travel to.

2059
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,080
I'm sorry for anyone that lives in Michigan.

2060
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,480
You have to travel to.

2061
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:18,900
Michigan.

2062
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,280
To go.

2063
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,540
To be there.

2064
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,100
I actually don't know.

2065
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,000
I've never been.

2066
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,920
Does anyone actually go to Michigan?

2067
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,200
Michigan is.

2068
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,960
Really nice though.

2069
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,120
I've never been to Michigan.

2070
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,460
I live there.

2071
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,380
I don't even.

2072
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,640
Guys if you give me the map.

2073
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,000
Of the United States of America.

2074
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,640
I would have no idea.

2075
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,220
Where Michigan is.

2076
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,020
I'm so sorry.

2077
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,900
I'm so sorry.

2078
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:53,840
Okay.

2079
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,780
Please.

2080
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,480
Does anyone tip santa.

2081
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,020
Besides milk and cookies.

2082
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,860
Thank you for the super chat.

2083
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,260
Thank you.

2084
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:05,620
Does he even get tips too?

2085
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,640
Is it close to Canada?

2086
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,020
It's.

2087
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,440
Half way into Canada.

2088
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,140
Sorry.

2089
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,460
I meant like.

2090
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,860
The funniest thing.

2091
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,680
Recently was that apparently.

2092
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:23,100
Trudeau finally graduated.

2093
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,820
Finally graduated.

2094
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,880
And then people were making.

2095
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,580
Graduation letters.

2096
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,400
For Justin Trudeau.

2097
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,760
I thought that was.

2098
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,540
Oh my god.

2099
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,280
Sorry.

2100
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,760
I meant the 51st state of America.

2101
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,140
I'm sorry.

2102
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,640
I think that was so funny.

2103
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,640
I normally.

2104
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,740
I don't get political.

2105
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,200
I thought that was.

2106
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,400
I thought that was so fucking funny.

2107
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,620
That they were like.

2108
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,040
We're gonna make you the 51st state.

2109
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,620
I'm sorry.

2110
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,040
That's the only thing I'll say about it.

2111
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:22,580
I thought that was so fucking funny.

2112
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,000
I was like.

2113
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,700
Wait, they can do that?

2114
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:30,520
I was like.

2115
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,640
We've been neighbors.

2116
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,000
They can just do that?

2117
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,500
I thought it was a joke.

2118
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,980
They can just.

2119
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,120
Make us the 51st state.

2120
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,380
I was like.

2121
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,540
I don't know.

2122
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,640
That was so fucking.

2123
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,020
That was so fucking funny.

2124
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,100
Anyway, moving on.

2125
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,340
Moving on.

2126
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,360
It's a joke.

2127
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,400
See you guys next year.

2128
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,660
See you brothers next year.

2129
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,260
See you guys.

2130
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:12,420
Oh say can you see.

2131
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,040
Anyway.

2132
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,860
I took you soon.

2133
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,540
We'll soon be American.

2134
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,320
It's a joke until it gets a little too real.

2135
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,960
Anyway, moving on.

2136
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,900
Moving on.

2137
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,520
I found out.

2138
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,440
Did you guys know that.

2139
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:38,840
The book of wicked.

2140
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,480
The book of wicked.

2141
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,500
You already accepted it.

2142
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,800
Look, all I'm saying is true.

2143
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,620
Look, us Canadians.

2144
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,000
All we care is that Trudeau is gone.

2145
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:59,980
That's all we care about right now.

2146
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,900
Everything else that happens.

2147
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,820
We already tried to get through that part at the moment.

2148
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:14,720
Anyway.

2149
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,040
As I was saying.

2150
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,060
Okay, so.

2151
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,340
I want to talk about wicked.

2152
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,380
All we care about is that we're finally.

2153
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:26,440
We're finally getting our mail.

2154
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,420
That too.

2155
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:28,360
I know that.

2156
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,300
Trudeau is not part of that problem.

2157
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,240
Not really part of that problem.

2158
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:34,880
But still.

2159
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:36,160
Of course we're going to blame him.

2160
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,700
Because we had the post strike for a long time.

2161
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,620
We just got our mail back guys.

2162
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,360
America.

2163
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,820
We literally just got mail back.

2164
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,940
We have so many other issues going on.

2165
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,140
We literally are finally receiving our mail.

2166
01:24:59,360 --> 01:24:59,900
Anyway.

2167
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:00,620
Anyway.

2168
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,080
Anyway.

2169
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,600
I want to talk about wicked.

2170
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,420
Because apparently.

2171
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,120
I just found out.

2172
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,800
We're doing it one thing at a time.

2173
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,700
We just found out.

2174
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:17,700
That.

2175
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,740
I just found out.

2176
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,260
That the book of wicked.

2177
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,660
You know how the musical is based on the book.

2178
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,640
That's based on the movie.

2179
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,080
That's based on the book.

2180
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:28,960
So like.

2181
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,320
I found out that the wicked book.

2182
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,920
Is like R rated.

2183
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:38,860
So like.

2184
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,680
The musical adaptation.

2185
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:42,980
The adaptation.

2186
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,800
For wicked.

2187
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,900
Was very very loosely based.

2188
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,400
Off of the book.

2189
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,800
So the person who wrote the wicked musical.

2190
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,660
Didn't really read the book.

2191
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:55,080
So.

2192
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,300
I didn't realize.

2193
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:58,460
That.

2194
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,640
I didn't realize.

2195
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,240
That the wicked book.

2196
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,420
Was essentially like the it.

2197
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,620
The original.

2198
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,520
Stephen King's it.

2199
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,040
Which don't read it by the way.

2200
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:12,900
Do not read it.

2201
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You would think it's like.

2202
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:14,760
It's not.

2203
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,220
It's a whole other journey.

2204
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:17,900
I read it.

2205
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,880
I got curious.

2206
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,300
Don't read it.

2207
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,600
Don't read it.

2208
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,640
I'm going to read that thing.

2209
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:26,960
So like.

2210
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,600
I got to that specific chapter.

2211
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:30,960
I was like.

2212
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,540
What the fuck.

2213
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,180
Now I can see why.

2214
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:36,740
He was into a lot of drugs.

2215
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:42,730
You guys didn't know.

2216
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,230
Stephen King.

2217
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,090
Was not sober.

2218
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,130
For a majority of his career.

2219
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,530
When I got to that part.

2220
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:51,470
I was like.

2221
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,090
I can see that now.

2222
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:56,510
I get it.

2223
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,830
It all makes sense.

2224
01:26:59,450 --> 01:26:59,470
Now.

2225
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:00,570
And so.

2226
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:03,290
Anyway.

2227
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,450
You can sort of tell.

2228
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:05,830
Yeah.

2229
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,150
Anyway.

2230
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,010
The wicked book.

2231
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,670
Apparently is very similar.

2232
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,410
It's very similar.

2233
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,310
To that.

2234
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,250
And.

2235
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,130
And.

2236
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,230
I was told.

2237
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:24,490
That there is.

2238
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,510
I saw they were talking about.

2239
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:28,610
What was essentially in.

2240
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,010
The book of wicked.

2241
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:31,530
And the most fucked up part.

2242
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:33,930
I saw a twitter video of it.

2243
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:36,370
And people were like.

2244
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:39,910
Do not buy this book for your kids.

2245
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:40,930
And then.

2246
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,910
The book was next to literally.

2247
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,030
Children.

2248
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:46,090
Those children picture books.

2249
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:47,690
Of adaptations.

2250
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:48,990
Of films.

2251
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:51,130
Where it's really cute.

2252
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:53,510
And.

2253
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:56,870
Colorful.

2254
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:57,470
And everything.

2255
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:00,610
Those children story books.

2256
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,250
And it was a children.

2257
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,750
Picture book adaptation.

2258
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:04,690
Of wicked.

2259
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,550
But then the original novel.

2260
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,210
Was right next to it.

2261
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:10,770
And then the video was like.

2262
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:12,890
Do not buy this for your kids.

2263
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:13,790
And I was like.

2264
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:14,970
What's wrong with it?

2265
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,030
I was like why?

2266
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:17,470
The musical was alright.

2267
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:19,210
The musical was pretty alright.

2268
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,490
The movie was pretty alright.

2269
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:22,050
The movie was pretty good.

2270
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:22,890
Other than the fact that.

2271
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,830
It suffered from lack of colors.

2272
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,630
Other than that.

2273
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:28,530
It was pretty alright.

2274
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:30,650
And then.

2275
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,650
I read the replies.

2276
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,150
And they're like.

2277
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:36,050
They're like.

2278
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,750
This book was written in the 70's.

2279
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:40,350
And then I was like.

2280
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:47,550
I was like.

2281
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:49,030
Oh.

2282
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:55,910
So you guys didn't know what happens.

2283
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:57,170
In the 70's.

2284
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:58,870
Everything is.

2285
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,730
Everything happens.

2286
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,110
In the 70's.

2287
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:06,850
It all makes sense now.

2288
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,010
A lot of things happen.

2289
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:11,970
In the 70's.

2290
01:29:12,130 --> 01:29:14,410
A lot of crazy things happen.

2291
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,770
What didn't happen.

2292
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,490
In the 70's.

2293
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:20,690
It was a very freaky time.

2294
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,650
It was like.

2295
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:23,730
The decade.

2296
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:25,390
Where everybody was like.

2297
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:26,830
Let's just try everything.

2298
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,430
And.

2299
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:31,210
So.

2300
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:33,650
That was when the book was written.

2301
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:36,850
And I was reading like.

2302
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,810
Some of the tidbits of like.

2303
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:40,470
Here are some things to expect.

2304
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:41,390
From the book.

2305
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:42,750
And they're like.

2306
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:48,210
I read it.

2307
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:49,150
And I was like.

2308
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,410
Holy shit.

2309
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:52,490
I was like.

2310
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,510
Holy fuck.

2311
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:55,570
What.

2312
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,990
And they made a musical out of this.

2313
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:06,970
They made a fucking musical.

2314
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:10,490
And then.

2315
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,070
Yeah.

2316
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,750
Okay, so I'll read this sentence.

2317
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:19,430
From one of the commentators.

2318
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,350
From this.

2319
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:21,790
Where I was like researching.

2320
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:24,450
About this book.

2321
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:26,930
Yeah, who fucking looks at this book.

2322
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,310
Was like this would make a great musical.

2323
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,310
And they managed to have nothing.

2324
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:33,170
And then the only thing.

2325
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,930
That I felt like they got from the book.

2326
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:36,670
Was Glinda and Elphaba.

2327
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:39,190
Anyway, so I'll read this one sentence.

2328
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,130
And then you'll realize.

2329
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,990
You'll realize why.

2330
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,490
It's a really bad book.

2331
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,110
And why I was very surprised.

2332
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:47,810
They put this next to children books.

2333
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:49,810
Okay, these books.

2334
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:52,310
Were in the young adult section.

2335
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:53,710
At my local library.

2336
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,590
I distinctly remember.

2337
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,750
Getting to the weird sex scene.

2338
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:00,290
With the tiger, lion, whatever.

2339
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,230
And putting down.

2340
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,130
The book.

2341
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:06,190
I was maybe 12 or 13.

2342
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:06,730
13.

2343
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:08,590
The what?

2344
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:19,730
The fucking what?

2345
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:26,110
Excuse me.

2346
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:28,010
And you were 12.

2347
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:34,310
Oh my god.

2348
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:35,130
Anyway.

2349
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,130
Yeah.

2350
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,790
So that's why I was like.

2351
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:40,970
Oh my god.

2352
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:44,490
They made a musical out of this.

2353
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:46,290
So yeah.

2354
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,730
I think the bad part.

2355
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:49,970
About Wicked being.

2356
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,750
Insanely popular now.

2357
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:52,750
Is that people.

2358
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:55,610
Young teens.

2359
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,650
Are gonna be like.

2360
01:31:56,930 --> 01:32:00,130
Let me read the fucking book adaptation.

2361
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,330
Of this movie.

2362
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:03,250
To see.

2363
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:05,010
It's gotta be like.

2364
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:08,370
All the other book adaptations out there.

2365
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:08,850
You know.

2366
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,370
Maybe it's sort of close to the source material.

2367
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:13,610
Now I'm like.

2368
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:14,490
People are like.

2369
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:18,350
Why does this book not have an R rating?

2370
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:20,050
I don't.

2371
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,550
Oh my god.

2372
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:23,570
I'm just very surprised.

2373
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:26,190
The book cover doesn't have.

2374
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:29,050
An R rating on it.

2375
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:31,510
Oh my god.

2376
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:35,050
Yeah.

2377
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,130
Now apparently.

2378
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:39,930
It's really freaky.

2379
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:42,150
There's more to it.

2380
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:43,230
I read like.

2381
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:46,310
You think that's the only.

2382
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:48,030
There's a lot of sex scenes.

2383
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:49,730
I'm just gonna straight up say it.

2384
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:52,390
There's a lot of sex scenes in this book.

2385
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:53,690
And I'm like.

2386
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,310
But the musical.

2387
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:57,530
They kiss if they're lucky.

2388
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:57,830
Like.

2389
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,530
I told you.

2390
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:03,650
It was written in the.

2391
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:05,430
In the 70s.

2392
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,350
It was written in the 70s.

2393
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:09,450
It's just.

2394
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:10,730
It's freaky.

2395
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:13,150
It's just fucking freaky.

2396
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:19,950
It was.

2397
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:22,130
I'm gonna see if I like.

2398
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:24,130
If I like the Twitter video of it.

2399
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:26,090
Cause sometimes I like Twitter videos to be like.

2400
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:27,450
Oh I wanna show this.

2401
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:28,690
I wanna show this.

2402
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,530
This funny thing.

2403
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:32,950
I wanna talk about it.

2404
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:34,830
I wanna show it to my dragoons.

2405
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:37,510
I wonder if I did.

2406
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,450
Oh I didn't.

2407
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:41,070
The video was literally just like.

2408
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,730
You see the kids books.

2409
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:46,630
You see the children book.

2410
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,870
And literally right next to the children book.

2411
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,770
Was the wicked book.

2412
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:50,810
And I'm like this is.

2413
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:53,510
Like.

2414
01:33:53,810 --> 01:33:55,190
If I didn't realize.

2415
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,510
How bad.

2416
01:33:58,010 --> 01:33:59,610
The original book was.

2417
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:00,710
I.

2418
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,870
I would have never known.

2419
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:04,710
I legitimately would have.

2420
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,810
Never known about it.

2421
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:08,830
Cause I.

2422
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:09,990
I didn't know.

2423
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:11,610
I heard it was like loosely.

2424
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:14,830
I heard it was like a loose adaptation.

2425
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:17,490
But I didn't realize.

2426
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:18,690
How.

2427
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:21,770
I didn't.

2428
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:22,870
I didn't.

2429
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,070
It was a short.

2430
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:27,010
I didn't realize.

2431
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:28,290
How.

2432
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:31,750
How loose the adaptation was.

2433
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:33,530
I was not.

2434
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:34,970
Here you go.

2435
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:37,450
Thanks Doki.

2436
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:39,550
Downloading the audio.

2437
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:40,730
Book now.

2438
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:43,510
Yummy thank you for the super chat.

2439
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:44,070
Thank you.

2440
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:45,010
Thank you.

2441
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:47,910
Nepper thank you for the super chat.

2442
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:48,250
Thank you.

2443
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:51,190
Sounds like my friend got introduced to M-rated games.

2444
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:52,930
Parents just saw the cover art.

2445
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:54,710
And what game it was next to.

2446
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,870
On the blockbuster shelves.

2447
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,910
Thank you for the super chat.

2448
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:58,930
Thank you.

2449
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:01,670
Looking at this.

2450
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:03,170
If I see this.

2451
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:06,690
If I see it next to those books.

2452
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,890
I'd be like what's wrong with it.

2453
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:11,030
Oh it wasn't written in the 70's.

2454
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:12,010
It was written in the 90's.

2455
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:13,790
Oh it was also pretty bad too.

2456
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:14,710
Nevermind.

2457
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:18,910
It wasn't in the 70's.

2458
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,770
I feel like 90's is pretty bad too.

2459
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:22,750
90's there was some.

2460
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:24,850
90's was when like.

2461
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:26,470
Shit got crazy too.

2462
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:26,690
No.

2463
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:29,930
Fricking shit got crazy in the 90's as well.

2464
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:31,710
Laughing.

2465
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:33,850
Laughing.

2466
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:35,490
Laughing.

2467
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:37,850
Yeah but.

2468
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,850
Being born in the 90's.

2469
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:41,850
You didn't live the 90's.

2470
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:43,370
Laughing.

2471
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:49,110
Guys.

2472
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:50,950
True.

2473
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:53,930
In the 90's we have Annie Morris.

2474
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:54,990
That's true.

2475
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,030
That's true.

2476
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,190
Oh my god.

2477
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:01,750
90's were peak.

2478
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:06,470
Back in the 90's.

2479
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,710
I was in a very famous TV show.

2480
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:10,970
Alright.

2481
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:11,730
Anyway.

2482
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:12,970
So yeah.

2483
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:15,310
It was pretty wild.

2484
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:18,270
It was pretty fucking wild.

2485
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:19,870
Like reading about.

2486
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:21,750
I did not read the Wicked book.

2487
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,130
So like.

2488
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:25,110
I was very surprised.

2489
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:26,830
I was very surprised that.

2490
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:29,490
A lot of stuff happened in that book.

2491
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,450
And I was you know.

2492
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:32,610
Like.

2493
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:35,590
The fact that they put Ariana Grande.

2494
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:37,130
And like Cynthia.

2495
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:40,090
I forgot her last name.

2496
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:40,990
And Cynthia.

2497
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:42,350
On the cover.

2498
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:43,810
For this book.

2499
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:45,530
Laughing.

2500
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:48,130
Laughing.

2501
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:57,530
I don't think you would want them to be on the cover.

2502
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:58,510
Of this book.

2503
01:36:58,990 --> 01:36:59,590
Laughing.

2504
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:04,090
Oh my god.

2505
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:04,910
Anyway.

2506
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:06,930
God is so solid.

2507
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:08,630
Cynthia Ervio.

2508
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:11,330
Alright guys.

2509
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,130
Oh my god.

2510
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,490
I've been yapping for a while.

2511
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,290
Time passes by so fast.

2512
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:20,370
I'm gonna call it here.

2513
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:22,250
Because we have.

2514
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:24,010
Two streams technically tomorrow.

2515
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:26,030
Yeah two streams tomorrow.

2516
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:28,550
So I'm gonna call it here.

2517
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:29,650
I'm gonna rest my voice.

2518
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:31,850
And it's great to be back on YouTube.

2519
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:34,350
And it's great to be back here with you guys.

2520
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:34,730
Dragons.

2521
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:38,630
I hope you guys had a great time.

2522
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:40,530
Great time.

2523
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:41,790
Hanging out with me today.

2524
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:42,950
As like a little.

2525
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,510
I'm back everybody.

2526
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:46,070
I'm fucking back.

2527
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,770
I'm fucking back.

2528
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:52,650
Yes.

2529
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:55,270
Scheduled content is back on the YouTube guys.

2530
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:57,850
And it's great to be back.

2531
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,050
I'm also gonna have.

2532
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:00,530
Longer content.

2533
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:01,990
Longer video content.

2534
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:05,690
I'm gonna be starting trial runs.

2535
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:07,050
With various editors.

2536
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:09,050
To find my perfect.

2537
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:11,630
Editor or editors match.

2538
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,290
So we can finally have.

2539
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:15,930
Longer video form content.

2540
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:17,230
On the channel.

2541
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:20,170
I've been debating about it for the longest time.

2542
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:21,110
Because like.

2543
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:25,850
I like to keep video uploads.

2544
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:27,190
Clean.

2545
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:29,310
That part.

2546
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,190
Especially for music stuff.

2547
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:33,950
So people can just go and find the music instantly.

2548
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:35,150
But then I figured.

2549
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:36,990
I feel like.

2550
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:39,370
I saw a lot of dragoons that were like.

2551
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:41,190
I can't catch up on vods.

2552
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,610
I wish you had more video content.

2553
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:44,290
So like.

2554
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:46,910
Even if I can't catch up on vods.

2555
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:48,570
At least I have the videos.

2556
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:51,330
To be up to date on some of the things.

2557
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:54,350
Or see some of your best moments there.

2558
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:56,770
So I debated for the longest time.

2559
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:59,190
And I decided to give it a try.

2560
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:01,050
Because I know I'm not.

2561
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,550
Going to upload a lot of music anyway.

2562
01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:03,330
In general.

2563
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:05,630
But in the past I used to like to.

2564
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:07,890
Keep the video section clean.

2565
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:10,250
For special animations.

2566
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:12,550
And music and stuff.

2567
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:15,070
So it is a risk I'm taking.

2568
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,690
Because it does mean that.

2569
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:18,630
The more special videos.

2570
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,330
And stuff might be harder to find.

2571
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,490
In the video tab.

2572
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,970
But I wanted to give it a shot.

2573
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:25,170
You know, I want to see.

2574
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,570
I just want to try it out.

2575
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,790
And see how it goes.

2576
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,690
In terms of having like.

2577
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:35,190
More edited form content.

2578
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:36,430
Anyway guys.

2579
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:39,110
As always everybody stay hydrated.

2580
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:40,210
Posture check.

2581
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,150
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2582
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:43,310
And if you didn't stay up for me.

2583
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:45,590
Head to bed cause you deserve it.

2584
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:47,230
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2585
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:48,670
Bye guys.

2586
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:49,410
Bye.
