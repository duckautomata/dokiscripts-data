00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,730
Everyone!

2
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,150
Hello!

3
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,050
Hello, hello, hello!

4
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,110
Hello, hello!

5
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,890
How do I move you around on the collab thing?

6
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,830
Oh, you go to the bottom, like, you know, at the bottom,
right?

7
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,630
It says the, you click on that and then there's, like, you
control the position.

8
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,170
Yeah, yeah.

9
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,230
I gotta make you small.

10
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,190
I actually gotta make both of us smaller.

11
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,030
Give me a sec.

12
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,350
Yeah.

13
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,610
Oh, that's not the right one.

14
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,910
Okay, I think this is where we're small.

15
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,510
No, that's not us when we're smaller.

16
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,550
I think, no, that's not us when we're smaller.

17
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,870
I'll eventually find the small version.

18
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,030
I think it's, oh, there we go.

19
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,430
There we go.

20
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,090
Now we're smaller here.

21
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,350
There we go.

22
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,210
Now we're a little smaller because we won't make sure we
don't cover.

23
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,570
Actually, I don't know.

24
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,550
Should I be a bit bigger?

25
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,490
Let's make it, let's do that.

26
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,230
It's okay.

can generate large amounts of voltage terrain tiles which in

111
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:42,510

that is yeah so so yeah so it's like it's like part of the

112
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:48,670
gameplay so they all have like different type advantages and
stuff so that's why that's what like the tiles are like you

113
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,930
know the movement and stuff is the tiles um because it's
like a strategy game and my chat loves like making fun in

114
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:02,950
strategy games uh but the thing i love about this game is
that there's a thing called auto and when i click it it

115
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:15,450
doesn't matter how good i am at strategy i i just win when i

Are you guys ready, guys?

694
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,600
Actually, Snuffy, you should do more.

695
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,880
Well, I feel like I can stall a lot longer.

696
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,340
I'm seeing if I can do, like, a multi-pool, maybe.

697
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,740
You're going to do a multi-pool?

698
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,200
You're going to pull more than once?

699
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,860
I think I can do that if I'm smart, but I don't know.

700
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,640
I'm going to enter my own giveaway again.

701
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,300
I'm kind of tempted.

702
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,500

00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,280

I've never done this before.

759
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,820
You have to, like, link me, though, I think.

760
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,280
I have to link you?

761
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,200
Let me check my, like, Twitch notifications.

762
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,180
How do I actually...

763
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,340
This is my first tab.

764
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,160
Why is there, like, a Discord call?

765
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,240
Oh, here we go.

766
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:58,820
Oh.

00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,560
We have, like, a little Discord call, too.

768
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,500
What is this?

769
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,860
Wait, have you never done this?

770
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,960
No, bro, I'm not on Twitch.

771
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,260
What do you mean?

772
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,620
You're literally on Twitch all the time.

773
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,760
That is not true.

774
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,480
Don't lie to yourself.

775
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,780
You played Marvel Rivals.

776
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,140
That is not, that is true.

777
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,000
But the last time I played Rivals was a while ago on stream.

778
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,540

779

780
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,620

00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,960
Was your character serving drinks?

861
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,560
We need to find the pool.

862
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,920
Uh, what?

863
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,000
Talk to...

864
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,520
Okay, no.

865
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,500
We gotta go to the pool.

866
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,580
Call of a hair accessory?

867
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,200
Where's the pool?

868
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,600
Yeah, Brian has no ass, unfortunately.

869
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,760
I thought I would sit on this bike, but...

870
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,640
I just sat next to it.

871
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,860
I don't see Klu-Kai, but I'm gonna talk to Peru.

872
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,340
Aridia, she's nice.

873
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,400
Wait, I think I found...

874
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,680
Wait, actually, no, that's not the pool.

875
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,620
There's the armory.

876
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,500
Oh, that's cool.

877
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,260
This is new.

878
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,020
The crew deck.

879
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,080
Oh, it's in the wreck room.

880
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,220
We have to go to the wreck room.

881
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,960
What are these, like, envelopes?

882
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,400
Why does it say it costs two envelopes to proceed to talk to
this character?

883
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,140
Should I get them?

884
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,180
I don't know.

885
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:48,820
They just...

886
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,900
They want, like, letters and stuff, I guess.

887
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,380
Oh, my God.

888
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,600
Wait, there's a lucky gotcha?

889
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:53,740
Guys, I gotta do this.

890
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,740
Oh, it took me to the wreck room.

891
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,040
Oh, my God!

892
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,740
I already have that.

893
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,320
I don't need it.

894
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,920
I were nerdy lucky enough.

895
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,280
I think I lost.

896
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,380
I think I'm off track.

897
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,140
I think I'm off track.

898
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:04,720
I think you're okay.

900
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,420
I got to a pool.

901
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Okay.

902
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:06,560
All right.

903
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,080
No, no, no.

904
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,280
Okay.

905
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,960
I'm waiting for you.

906
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,640
I'm in the wreck room.

907
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,980
I'm just with another woman.

908
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,860
I'm with another individual.

909
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,820
No, you gotta go outside.

910
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,700
You go outside and then you see her at sunbathing.

911
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,640
And then did you see this?

912
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,560
Torino stares at me with her hetachromatic gaze.

913
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,920
Okay, are you ready?

914
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,820
I gave Peridia my money and now she's...

915
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,760
Why did you give her your money?

916
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,860
Because I love her.

917
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,580
You just met her!

918
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,080
She's so good.

You literally just met her.

920
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,300
She's so perfect.

921
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,360
These are perfect enough.

922
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,560
Oh my god, cool guys.

923
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,780

Talk to her.

You're just saying things.

Like, okay, you go downstairs.

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,160

Go to the terrace!

00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,300
Stop paying the money to do it for free!

1031
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,600
Okay, okay, is it Dolchit Whisper or do I just talk to
Klukei?

1032
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,200
The Dolchit Whisper is the Dolchit Whisper.

1033
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,940
There was another character with Dolchit Whisper though.

1034
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

1035
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,320
That's true.

1036
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,040
No, no, there's a Ulrid.

1037
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,940
Ulrid also has Dolchit Whisper.

1038
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,000
Should I see what that's about?

1039
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,920
Is that, are they both the event?

1040
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,720
No, it's Kukai and Machiavelli.

1041
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,680
I'm trying to remember.

1042
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,460
Oh, here's $2.

1043
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,420
Okay, now I'm giving her $2, too.

1044
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,940
I gave Machiavelli $2.

1045
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,620
Wait, you, but you yelled at me saying I can't give her $2.

1046
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,840
Yeah, but she's part of the event, Snuffy.

1047
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,440
It's in our briefing.

1048
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,220
We have to give her money.

1049
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,840
You gave, you were giving random people money.

1050
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,760
I just, like, I just, I just, I just wanted everybody to
prosper.

1051
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,820
The Klukai!

1052
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,400
Oh my god.

1053
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,480
Girl, don't you know it's November?

1054
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,400
Put on some clothes?

1055
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,380
I'm feeling relaxed and tipsy.

1056
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,800
Oh my god, I just offered her a drink.

1057
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,820
Happy Thanksgiving, Klukai.

1058
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,060
Makiado shows me a list of stuff.

1059
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,680
Oh, she's, I'm furniture shopping with Makiado.

1060
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,260
Sabi is to test you.

I'm giving her mischievous help.

1073
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,400
Why are her hands so detailed?

1074
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,960
Oh, you'll know why.

1075
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,360

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,720
I clicked the back.

1097
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:26,680
I didn't know that it was like.

1098
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,360
I didn't know that it was like dependent on what area you
are.

1099
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,060
I know what you are, fluffy.

1100

No, cuz you wouldn't wear shoes in the beach.

01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,640
I'm wearing shoes.

1103
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,720
I'm wearing crocs.

1104
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,380
What are you talking about?

1105
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,940
Those are good.

1106
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:52,620
I'm wearing crocs So it's like she there's different routes
you can go so it's like she's getting paid for this.

1107
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,380
I'm jealous

1108
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,340
Wait, who's next to come here.

1109
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,160
I go to the TV at the bottom You go to the giant, you see
the giant TV.

1110
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,040
Yeah.

1111
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,420
I think...

1112
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,300
Yeah, you see the TV.

1113
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,660
And then you click Dolce Wessper on the TV.

1114
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,040
Or on her.

1115
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

1116
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,280
Yeah, I'm doing it with you.

1117
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:14,720
I clicked it.

1118
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,060
And then she's on that couch, right, with her feet out, with
her grippers out.

1119
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,760
No, she's wearing tights.

1120
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,740
Yeah, but her grippers are technically out.

1121
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,040
If you were paying attention to that, they would be...

1122
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,840
They're technically not out.

1123
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,760
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1124
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,580
Snuffy is technically hiding the grippers, so can you move a
little to the right?

1125
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,020
Can you move a little to the right?

1126
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,680
Snuffy just tilt a little.

1127
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:41,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1128
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,920
Let me just, let me just...

1129
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,120
Okay, so now I'm paranoid of where I'm going to click, and
now Chad is going to judge me if I click anywhere.

1130
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,100
No, you can't.

1131
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,420
You guys do go with your instinct.

1132
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,520
You're thinking too hard.

1133
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,700
We gotta know what your...

1134
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,640
your real reactions are.

1135
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,240
We're not getting away so easily.

1136
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:06,960
Why?

1137
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,580
Oh, come and sit down?

1138
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:12,020
Whoa!

1139
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,240
Yo, she just...

1140
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,160
Oh, she has nice nails.

1141
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,240
Distraction.

1142
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,140
What did you do?

1143
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,140
you press.

1144
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,060
I picked hand in hand.

1145
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,600
Oh, you just held her hand?

1146
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,200
Yeah, I kind of wanted to do the brow option, though.

1147
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,760
Oh, coward.

1148
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,640
Oh, I held her hand.

1149
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,960
I'm holding her hand right now.

1150
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:49,660
Oh, my God.

1151
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,980
Oh, my God.

1152
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,200
Before marriage?

1153
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:53,780
Touch.

1154
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:54,700
Hand holding.

1155
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,380
Oh,

1156
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,730
you don't like this movie?

1157
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,150
We can watch something else, girl.

1158
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,290
You heard of Netflix and chill?

1159
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,650
But she just stares at you, you shouldn't care.

1160
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,290
She's not even watching the movie.

1161
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,090
Yeah, yeah, you're not even watching the movie.

1162
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:11,730
What's the point?

1163
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:16,350
Her eyes haven't even turned a little bit to the TV.

1164
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,930
She's only focused on us.

1165
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:19,870
She wants to look at it.

1166
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,850
What the heck?

1167
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,790
Oh wait, it is a horror film.

1168
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:23,610
What?

1169
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,250
What's up?

1170
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,130
It's literally the shining, isn't it?

1171
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:32,030
You're the twins.

1172
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:33,790
Little tees.

1173
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,670
Comforting words are there.

1174
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:36,870
What would you say?

1175
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:37,890
What'd you pick?

1176
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,170
I took, I little tees.

1177
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:40,830
What about you?

1178
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,390
Little tees.

1179
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,890
Oh, I didn't even see that option.

1180
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,950
Oh, I made sure to see that.

1181
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:47,150
I'm teasing here.

1182
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,510
I'm doing its itsy bitsy spider.

1183
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,480
Touch.

1184
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:06,520
Oh, touch.

1185
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,160
Yeah, I got that touch.

1186
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,200
Touch.

1187
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,360
I'd like to touch.

1188
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:11,600
Okay.

1189
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,260
Yeah.

1190
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,340
Um, the touch icon was on the face.

1191
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,780
Why was it on the shoulder?

1192
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,000
It's not what I sign up for.

1193
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,000
See no evil.

1194
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,000
See no evil.

1195
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:23,580
Hear no.

1196
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,920
Timely warning.

1197
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,900
Let's do... I'm going to do what you're going to do.

1198
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,060
I'm going to do hear no evil.

1199
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,780
I'll do see no evil.

1200
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,380
I'll cover your eyes.

1201
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,360
I'll cover your ears.

1202
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,380
I am so detailed.

1203
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,520
I've got nice fingernails.

1204
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,360
Don't worry.

1205
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,260
I just don't hear the scary jumping.

1206
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,340
I'm scared, so it won't matter.

1207
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:44,500
Yeah.

1208
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,980
Well, what did you get?

1209
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:51,860
What are you?

1210
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,740
I got her slapping her boobs on my face.

1211
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:56,500
What?

1212
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:57,700
Dang.

1213
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:58,880
What did you?

1214
01:05:59,060 --> 01:05:59,660
I got scammed.

1215
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,260
I should have been hearing.

1216
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:03,840
I won.

1217
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,120
Okay, who next?

1218
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,000
Can I do this again?

1219
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,220
Can I just...

1220
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,100
I'm going back to the VR.

1221
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:08,980
You want to do it?

1222
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,260
It's just...

1223
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,420
Can I do this again?

1224
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,820
You like retried.

1225
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,620
Didn't get the booze option.

1226
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,460
Apparently you can decorate your crew deck.

1227
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,860
How did you- I was doing.

1228
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,460
How did you customize it?

1229
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,920
Press F4, I think?

1230
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:30,960
F4, what?

1231
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,240
What?

1232
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,700
Is that not what it is?

1233
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,680
What do you mean?

1234
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,000
Oh, I see it.

1235
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:38,700
I see it.

1236
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,280
I'm glad you're going to say alt F4.

1237
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,260
Yeah, just press F4.

1238
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:42,700
Oh,

1239
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,960
I could change, like, the fridge.

1240
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,780
Oh, the Galaxy fridge is pretty cool.

1241
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,900
I like the Galaxy fridge.

1242
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,500
They have Galaxy TV.

1243
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,240
How do you get $25?

1244
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:00,840
Dang.

1245
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,580
Gotta make those girls work it.

1246
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,680
I want to get a lot of different things.

1247
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,240
Oh, my God.

1248
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,080
Wait, I can show, like, a Zen garden, too.

1249
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,320
Wait, I have an aquarium.

1250
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:12,900
Wait, what?

1251
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,140
Wait, do I have enough money for this?

1252
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,020
Okay, I'm going to put an aquarium in here.

1253
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,280
Oh, I see.

1254
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,020
Confirmed.

1255
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,680
Oh, there's like a cat tower.

1256
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,740
Oh, you can craft stuff or something.

1257
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,360
Yeah, I put in an aquarium.

1258
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,780
There's a capybara.

1259
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,140
Wait, there is?

1260
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:30,880
Where is it?

1261
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,960
I don't, I could not explain how to get there.

1262
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,340
Yeah, there's like...

1263
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,460
I do not see the capybara option.

1264
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,500
like furniture layout, ornament layout, theme layout.

1265
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:51,020
If you click ornament layout and you click like, you click
where it says like one or two on the screen, gives you like

1266
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,700
little ornaments you can place down.

1267
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,340
Oh, that's cute.

1268
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,520
Oh, yeah, the laptop.

1269
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,740
You can display your figures and stuff.

1270
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,900
I can display my laptop, guys.

1271
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:00,980
Kurios.

1272
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,440
I don't put that here.

1273
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,620
That's cute.

1274
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,160
These are cute.

1275
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,140
This game is kind of amazing.

1276
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,360
There's a lot of stuff you can do here.

1277
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,800
I just want to go back to the VRS.

1278
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,140
You can add different dolls, too, if you want here, too.

1279
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,900
I love the cat tower, mapping the cat tower.

1280
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,660
My girls are going to love this.

1281
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,160
I love the cat tower.

1282
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,940
First, I can't theme layout.

1283
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:36,040
Oh, oh, I could decorate a theme to it, too.

1284
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,540
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can do.

1285
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:39,960
Oh, my God.

1286
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,840
I put the cat tower up here and all the women, like, All the
women.

1287
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,420
They came up here.

1288
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,480
They knew they were like, ooh, kitty.

1289
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:48,440
Meow, meow.

1290
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,840
So which one of you wants to get in VR?

1291
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,460
Oh, I'm making them make food for me.

1292
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:57,580
That's right.

1293
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:58,720
Cook for Brian.

1294
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,220
How do you do that?

1295
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,380
Oh, my name is Blake.

1296
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,640
How do you cook food for me?

1297
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,240
That's right.

1298
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,780
I just recruited Lena and I'm like, cook for me.

1299
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,880
Oh my God, what?

1300
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,140
Cook for me.

1301
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:12,960
Cook for Brian.

1302
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,060
How do you raise your bunny?

1303
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:18,960
Yummy, yummy.

1304
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,540
It tastes pretty.

1305
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,920
If I say okay, then she'll strive to make it better.

1306
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,940
See, I'll try making it even tastier next time, guys.

1307
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,960
I told her it's just all right, and then she'll try for
something better.

1308
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:35,700
It's just all right.

1309
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,780
That's terrible.

1310
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:43,180
Don't, no, she was like, I'll make sure to make it even
better next time, and I'm like, good.

1314
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,480
I wonder how to make them make food for you.

1315
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,900
You go back to the main lobby, like the front air.

1316
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,460
And then there's like a, you saw the, there's a delicious
cuisine and you click that.

1317
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,140
Gotcha, gotcha.

1318
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,600
Oh, I can put stickers too.

1319
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,980
Oh, that's cute.

1320
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,200
I'm going to put stickers on my favorite girls.

1321
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:31,940
I like that one.

1322
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,540
Delicious cuisine.

1323
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,300
Yeah, and then make the new girl cook food for you.

1324
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,620
The new girl.

1325
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,620
All right, you girl.

1326
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,580
Time for you to pass the test.

1327
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,300
The cuisine.

1328
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:57,300

1332
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,900
Don't eat that.

1333
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:17,640
Poor thing.

1334
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,780
My once keen sense of taste loses its functionality.

1335
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,280
She just made me poison.

1336
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,440
Bro, what the fuck?

1337
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,900
I got a great experience.

1338
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,420
I'm getting the best parts of this sponsee.

1339
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:34,340
I'm gonna have to tell her that this was barely edible
because she literally crafted me like straight poison.

1340
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh my god.

1341
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,720
I'm doing the ASMR right now.

1342
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,500
I'm doing the ASMR.

1343
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,300
Oh, my God.

1344
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,260
Did you get to pick who you did?

1345
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,040
No, it's Groza.

1346
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,980
I think it's a Groza experience.

1347
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,420
For 15!

1348
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:54,940
Oh, my God.

1349
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,160
There was a 120 minutes option, too.

1350
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,340
What if, like, I do an ASMR stream where I just boot this
up?

1351
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,320
And then I put...

1352
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,080
And then...

1353
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:09,920
And then stuffy...

1354
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,220
I put my PNG, my face on top of her.

1355
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:13,940
And...

1356
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,360

01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,880

1467
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,140
It's not Klu-Kai's hat.

1468
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,080
It doesn't matter.

1469
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,100

enjoyed her first time playing.

1492
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,200
She didn't even get to the real part of the game.

1493
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,320
I mean, not to like glaze.

1494
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,040
I didn't expect like full 3D unique animations and stuff.

1495
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,220
I had never played this game.

1496
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:06,140
So this was like you know this isn't the actual game, right?

1497
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:15,740
this is just like the side stuff because it said something
about the tiles when you like get different items and stuff

1498
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:24,240
so yeah this is like this is just like the this is this all
new though for the anniversary but this is like the you know

Do not leave you on the streets.

1521
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,380
I cannot be trusted with money.

1522
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:13,540
Do not not leave her on the streets with beautiful women.

1523
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,200
I cannot be trusted.

1524
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,440
