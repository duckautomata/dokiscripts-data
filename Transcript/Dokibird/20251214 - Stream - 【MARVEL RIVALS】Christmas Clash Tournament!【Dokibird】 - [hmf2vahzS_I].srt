120
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:46,190
okay the song okay let's hope the songs let's hope the
stream survives um i forgot about it no my my ad revenue oh

121
00:15:46,190 --> 00:16:00,830
my god okay so um the reason why i had to mute the stream is
because um it's because this song in particular is yeah I

122
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:09,350
muted the stream because I just it just clicked in my head
uh that's why you don't fucking hear it like clicked in my

123
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:22,250
head like what the fuck I'm listening to um so um this song
is DMCAable apparently the rival song is DMCAable and that's

124
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:33,010
like um the all the rival vibes on twitch not just me but
other streamers um they can't also we that's why i should

125
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:40,170
never go to time square too like in game i could i'm not
banned from time square in new york city but like in in the

126
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:49,330
rivals because the the rival song is dmca able and they have
not fixed that uh apparently is copyrightable and like in on

127
00:16:49,330 --> 00:17:00,830
some twitch some some streamers had their thank god uh my
only got muted so like there's nothing to worry about for

174
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,480
i'm like you're like i'm just like an outlier some like
they're like i don't know where to put it let's just put

175
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,880
your virus like i don't even have anyone like like there's
like these are all the support players, and I feel like I'm

176
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,960
like outcasted away in the fucking, in the fucking shadow
realm.

177
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,060
Like, what?

178
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,000
We can't like, what the fuck?

179
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,700
Why am I?

180
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,840
Why am I down there?

181
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,800
Why am I?

182
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,320
She can't sit with us.

183
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,720
She's not that she's not made of flesh.

184
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,060
She can't sit with us.

185
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,420
It's not sorted.

186
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,140
There's no way this is sorted alphabetically.

187
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,680
My name starts with D, and there's Desley up there.

188
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm, yeah, I'm on the fucking kids table right now.

189
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,640
I'm in the fucking kids table.

190
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,160
What the fuck?

191
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,140
Yeah, the new alphabet drops.

192
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,260
You think she's part of the team.

193
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,440
Oh, and they're like, Oh, wait, we were like, they had like,
it was like perfect symmetry.

194
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
And they're like, I think we're missing someone.

195
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,960
And they're like, oh, shit, wait, yeah.

196
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,740
We forgot Dinky Britain just added it in real quick.

197
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,020
So, yeah.

198
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,160
Because I don't know about, I should warm up too, but I'll
just do quick play.

199
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,940
I'm not fucking playing over a game.

200
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,620
It's sad.

201
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,140
We'll warm up and quick play.

202
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,320
Let's see if we can go.

203
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,680
Oh.

204
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:31,560
uh oh okay let's go i mean they they're they're choosing
supports last no mohat or what there is a chance i am last

205
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:43,440
pick i they are picking supports last um i don't even know
guys what the fuck is meant oh yeah i bought the i bought uh

206
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:53,820
i got this guys i think this is cute this is their cutest
outfit i like this outfit i hate her all like graphics

207
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:04,120
though i will say the one thing i'm not a fan of is just
like the the alt graphics are hit or miss they're so hit or

208
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:11,220
miss because it's so hard to see whenever someone's all
thing like because they're all different now like they're

209
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:19,680
all like there are all different colors and graphics and
like it's so hard it's like whatever the fuck alt is going

210
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:47,300
out now because everyone has their own fancy little alt
graphic yeah she's cute now she's pretty cute oh my god it's

211
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,140
a fucking It's okay, she's wearing bloomers, guys.

212
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,100
It's okay, it's not wrong.

213
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,560
She's wearing bloomers.

214
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,010
Okay, to be fair, I'm, like, thinking it's quick play.

215
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,670
Like, what the fuck are they gonna do to me?

216
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,770
They did a lot.

217
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,370
Okay, I would usually never do that, but I was like, it's
quick play.

218
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,190
Like, I don't care.

219
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,750
Bro, I was...

220
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,530
I thought it was quick play!

221
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:23,670
Okay!

222
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,070
I'm thinking, oh it's quick play, it should be fine.

223
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,910
Like, oh my god, I hit him one time, it's all that.

224
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,230
I did one hit.

225
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,070
There you go.

226
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,930
Look, see?

227
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,950
It's fine.

228
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,990
I just chuck it into the sky and then it hits someone
because it's so fucking fast.

229
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,750
Okay, I'll give it to myself because apparently I can't
trust people to heal me oh i don't know if i like that bell

230
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:06,890
child it's a bit annoying look it's a hit guarantee dude
that's that's the mess up part hello why is there a penny

231
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:12,390
behind oh my god what's i think i was lucky zeal

232
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:21,590
that's funny because lucky zeal is a spider-man one trick or
I don't know.

233
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,530
Mostly a Spider-Man player.

234
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,290
Oh my god, the first time it didn't hit anything.

235
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,770
The captain's part is like, I don't know.

236
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,990
I guess he count as a pro, I guess, if they're like, because
they're supposed to have, like, a limit on how many pros

237
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,910
people can have.

238
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,310
Yeah, the perfect hit.

239
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,890
Okay, it is quick then.

240
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:50,870
Yeah!

241
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,510
I'm ready, dance, everyone.

242
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,910
Yeah, I'm back in Luna jail.

243
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,310
Actually, no, I'm considering off support, so I can do this.

244
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,830
Oh, money, honey left.

245
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,030
Bye, money, honey.

246
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,890
All right, here we go.

247
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,830
It's fine.

248
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,850
I can leave a quick play whenever.

249
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,810
It's okay, I can heal myself.

250
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,010
If I can't trust no one, I can trust myself.

251
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,550
Bro, I'm not giving you my heals.

252
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,630
I'm not getting healed either, so...

253
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,690
Wow, look at that.

254
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,430
I hit somebody.

255
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,690
It's so fucking fast.

256
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,810
It better hit somebody.

257
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,470
Okay.

258
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,950
I don't know if I like the sound for this, though.

259
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,050
It's pretty annoying.

260
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,790
I will say the sound is very annoying.

261
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,610
It is absolutely...

262
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,750
What the fuck?

263
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,110
What the fuck is he doing there?

264
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,010
Oh, okay, cool.

265
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,050
Okay, cool.

266
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,750
Yeah, I'll turn it off.

267
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,370
I just wasn't sure what the sound sounded like until now.

268
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,450
Until now, I realize it's alright.

269
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,170
It's quick play.

270
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,030
I'm not losing much from this.

271
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,150
I wanted to check something out, but I forgot what it was.

272
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,670
It's alright.

273
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,030
Okay, it's a bit sad that I'm amazed, but it's okay.

274
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,310
It's it's okay.

275
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:37,250
It's quick play It is a bit sad

276
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,930
Yeah, it's okay.

277
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,870
I wanted to check something up.

278
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:53,710
I forgot what I wanted to check out Oh, yeah, I wanted to
show you guys my recap.

279
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,570
It's pretty funny.

280
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:01,170
I don't know how to access it but if i can find it i will
show you guys the recap because it's pretty silly

281
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:23,440
you're right i can't trust myself i keep sabotaging myself
no no my my rivals recap i don't know if i can check it i

282
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,860
don't know actually oh our spider-man left I don't know.

283
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,540
It's a little sad.

284
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,620
My quick play team is slowly leaving me.

285
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,980
Bro, it's quick play.

286
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,100
Like, what the fuck do you expect?

287
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,140
Like, quick play has the most random rank distribution.

288
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:50,360
This is why, like, during the VTuber rivals thing, every
other team was just, like, practicing via...

289
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,600
They were practicing via, like, quick play.

290
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,060
But, like, you get, like, bronze players in quick play
sometimes.

291
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:09,780
so so we went like actual we actually screamed against teams
because of it because i was just like yeah no yeah it's like

292
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:16,540
you like i would i would look at rank stats and stuff i'd be
like bro what the fuck i there would be like multiple bronze

293
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:25,460
silver players in quick play so like for the youtuber rivals
we organized scrims and stuff so we can actually have real

294
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,960
practice because playing against bronze players in a
tournament like if you're trying to practice for a

295
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:44,100
tournament is not not a not a good like practice in general
it's easier to form bad habits too okay i'm giving myself

296
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:55,000
the things oh god damn it there you go it's okay i'm healing
myself because I can't trust you guys.

297
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:55,840
Whoa.

298
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,180
Whoa.

299
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,040
It's okay.

300
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,520
I got the gambit out, though.

301
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,100
Oh.

302
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,240
She's taking everything.

411
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,540
I am the only stream on YouTube.

412
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,340
I was just thinking of her point against Lucky's Yo team.

413
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:43,380
We just ban supports from them so zypy can't play the game

414
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:52,600
two three four and five yeah i am the mainstream on youtube
i am the only stream on youtube for this tournament i have

415
00:42:52,600 --> 00:43:02,260
cornered the market in pro play right now they are just
banning supports anyways so yeah the market is all mine i

416
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:06,700
didn't saturate it on twitch We take those.

417
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,560
That's right.

418
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,660
I have the monopoly right now.

419
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,540
I have not spoken a word yet to my team.

420
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:25,200
I think the first word I'll speak in this team would be
like, what do I play?

421
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,540
I'd just be like, hey guys, what do I play?

422
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:41,980
That would be the only time I've, that would be the first
time i've spoken oh i'm so awkward i hate it i am so bad at

423
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:50,740
the speaking and socializing shit who would have thought
being stuck in the room with on your computer for like five

424
00:43:50,740 --> 00:44:01,540
plus hours a day stunts your socialization who would have
thought that that was a thing

425
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,600
Farming anti-social points.

426
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,640
How's your day?

427
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
It's like asking someone, how's the weather?

428
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,400
It's like, I don't know.

429
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,200
I feel weird saying shit like that.

430
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,020
I'd be like, hey, how's the weather up there?

431
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,360
It's okay.

432
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,820
See, they're all talking to their stream, though.

433
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,960
They are all mute.

434
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,120
It's not me.

435
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
It's not just me, at least.

436
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,580

00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,380

sharing view thing guys they're talking about that they're

471
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:52,600

472
00:46:52,600 --> 00:47:01,780
making the lobbies I'm figuring that out right now see what
they say see there no one knows no one's made a lobby yet no

474
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,620
everything is fine

475
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,440
Guys, I don't even know what the new meta is.

476
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,600
The tournament is a day after the new meta comes out.

477
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,720
I think it's literally whoever has the best fucking...

478
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm already in a collaboration.

479
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,340
It's like DPS or like, I don't know, like a train behind
you?

480
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,180
What was that?

481
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,460
I mean, it's a thing in Scotland that there's a bunch of
like trucks driving by and they're all spamming their car

482
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,400
horns in every street to like raise awareness.

483
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:56,120
all my scottish dragoons out there is that true well i

507
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,510
I actually, I'm on YouTube.

508
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,670
Like, who added me?

509
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,390
Oh, I don't know who are you.

510
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,330
They're like, are you streaming?

511
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,730
And I wrote, I'm on YouTube.

512
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,610
So they actually are like, where are you on Twitch?

513
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:41,110
I'll be like, I didn't know streaming on...

514
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:56,230
streaming on twitch mandatory there we go all right i wrote
that i was like whoa was it mandatory i don't i only do that

515
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:11,050
for like sponsors like it was a rival sponsor all right 80s
2 all right let's adjust this is just the all right here you

516
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:17,410
go I'm going to close off fucking Rylos and then boot up
Hades real quick.

517
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:30,490
Our first, okay, for those who are confused why we're on
Hades right now, our first match doesn't start until an hour

518
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,770
shake my head.

519
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,130
We'll do some runs like this.

520
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,110
There we go.

521
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:43,710
Here.

522
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:49,810
There we go.

523
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:50,790
Screw it.

524
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:51,530
I'm Hades.

525
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:52,190
Hades.

526
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:53,490
Hades thing right now.

527
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,210
I feel like it would be better.

528
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,190
Oh, well.

529
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,830
I can't really stop my stream and move over now.

530
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,170
I was like, oh, well, I can't really stop my stream and
move.

531
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,810
Move over.

532
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,250
Alright, here we go.

533
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,270
Here we go.

534
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,590
We're doing Hades.

535
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,990
The goddess of the hunt decided that the best use of her
talents...

536
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,450
Alright, wait.

537
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:21,770
Okay.

538
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,690
I feel weird talking to them, though.

539
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,630
Like, if they wanted everything to be on Twitch, also, it's
not even sponsored.

540
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,990
So that's why I was like, I'm not going to go on YouTube
because it's my main platform.

541
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,250
So I can keep the VOD on this channel.

542
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,170
It's not...

543
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,270
It's not mandatory, but they're like, oh, it'd be better.

544
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:45,870
Because they want to raise up.

545
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:52,010
The thing is, the thing they want to do for it is because
it's so they can add my view count into, like, the whole

546
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,090
Marvel Rivals category on Twitch.

547
00:52:55,330 --> 00:53:04,450
I mean, it is smarter to do on Twitch just because, just
because I would get the, what is it called?

548
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:09,270
I would get the, the sub, if you subscribe, you get the Jeff
badge.

549
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:20,430
wise for me me on twitch as well so i could like uh utilize
the sub equals twitch chep twitch badge or whatever um and

550
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:27,910
um why not dual stream i just don't like separating the
audience i like everyone to being in the same area and i

551
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:32,950
just don't like having two chats on the stream because it's
very way too cluttered yeah i could just far i i technically

552
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:39,050
i could have farmed the drops but the reason why they want
me on twitch is because um it's all about stats and numbers

553
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:46,230
so like the more people streaming on Twitch or streaming on
Twitch, the more they can add into their calculations for

554
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:54,150
their numbers, like to give to rivals, be like, look, this
tournament got X amount of people watching it, so they could

555
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:59,090
include my numbers into the statistic as well, and also
boost up the rivals category.

556
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:05,190
It's why Marvel Rivals always ask me to stream on Twitch
whenever I'm doing sponsors, because they want the category

557
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:14,010
to have my numbers in there, so they can have the category
so that's like the whole reason why usually but when people

558
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:27,530
do that oh yeah they're gonna stream and move over now yeah
that's why I was like sorry I can't stop it but if we split

559
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:36,630
the chat we can fight each other guys you guys are already
fighting each other in the Dragoon lands trying to figure

560
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:43,850
out who is the who is the peak Dragoon for him you guys
don't a fight more that's like eight more categories because

561
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:53,310
it's not just twitch versus youtube chat it's uh like long
goons twitch normal dragon twitch chonky goon twitch iggoons

562
00:54:53,310 --> 00:55:03,170
twitch versus like there's infighting and then there's like
and then there's like the platform fighting as well Oh,

563
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:06,690
hello.

564
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,570

Not here.

570
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,770
If I don't talk to them, will it keep their dialogue?

571
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,070
Like, if I don't talk to them, do the next run?

572
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,090
Will it keep their dialogue or am I fucked?

573
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:37,250

The rain's return.

00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:13,940
Hello.

587
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,800
I shouldn't snouch.

588
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,700
I should get up.

589
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,040
Things like an awful big coincidence.

590
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,960
But then we got these things.

591
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,060
They happen all the time.

592
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,640
Oh, I forgot.

593
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,640
Yeah, but like I want to do a fast run.

594
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,680
And I don't want to...

595
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,920
I'd rather do a run like a regular new run.

596
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,420
I'd rather do a regular new run during the...

597
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,480
and Flick Scorch.

598
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,160
I don't know.

599
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:38,820
One or three.

600
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,340
A new regular new run on an actual Hades stream.

601
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,200
This is just me doing, like, a regular run.

602
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,320
One or three, guys.

603
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,260
No, because I need to get this done quick, guys.

604
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,500
As I ask.

605
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,500
Okay, I'm not going to ask you guys about which one to do,
because I actually have to do this quick.

606
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,040
Alright.

607
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,460
I realize I actually have to do this really quick, so...

608
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,280
I gotta exercise my free will here, which is gonna be hard.

609
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,520
I'm not used to that.

610
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,880
Having free will is a new concept to me.

611
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,560
I've relied on chat so much on my build, so I'm like, what
is free will?

612
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,240
Uh, we'll grab this.

613
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,020
Alright.

614
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,000
BAM!

615
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,160
Okay.

616
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,740
Pick some grass up real quick.

617
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,220
It burned.

618
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,300
All right.

619
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,200
It's okay, my frog is here, too.

620
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,120
He's just a little guy.

621
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,800
Rare Toki independent thought.

622
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,220
She's actually...

623
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:52,620
Oh, my.

624
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,100
She's gonna have independent thought, guys.

625
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:55,780
It's wild.

626
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,720
Oh, my God.

627
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,800
It's a new day.

628
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,920
Oh, my God.

629
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,160
Toki is finally gaining independence.

630
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,320
USA.

631
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:11,720
USA.

632
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,520
Alright, there you go.

633
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,380
Oh, nice.

634
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,160
It's okay.

635
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,540
Five damage is okay.

636
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,520
I'll get it back anyway.

637
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,800
I can't believe it.

638
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,140
Toki's making her own choices.

639
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,480
Oh, why are you always here?

640
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,620
In its veins.

641
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,260
But Kronos turned it into little coins.

642
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,280
All over the damn place now.

643
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,400
Lord Keron's going to take care of it soon.

644
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,900
She grew, yeah, she hit so dangerous.

645
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,140
To keep thinking for herself, that sounds so dangerous.

646
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,660
Never leave a dokey unattended.

647
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,380
Don't worry.

648
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,180
Any gold I get from you, Karon, gets from me.

649
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,060
I'll give.

650
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,880
Here's my limit?

651
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,520
I mean, sure.

652
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,480
I mean, gold is...

653
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,060
Oh, hey!

654
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,380
Spatter time.

655
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,080
I opened the door first

656
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:32,160

658
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:50,580

659
01:00:50,580 --> 01:01:05,140

661
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,760
Yes, I just need something.

662
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:16,260
Okay, if I want to get the fire shit, the one thing I'm
missing right now is the...

663
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,020
Um...

664
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,680
Is the... What was it?

665
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,180
Okay.

666
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,120
Attack simply scorch.

667
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,140
Oh, let's just do more scorch.

668
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,620
Oh.

669
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,440
Oh, hey, I can fish.

670
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,700
Fishing time.

671
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,640
Within those waters, teams the strangest life.

672
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,040
Oh.

673
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:36,880
Yeah!

674
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,280
I got a bite.

675
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,280
I got a moper.

676
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,860
The fuck is a moper?

677
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,740
All right, I have enough money for this, though.

678
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:50,100
Let's gotta make sure I'm not missing any notifications or
anything.

679
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,960
All right, you guys can tell me if it's our team's turn to
fight, right?

680
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,180
You guys would tell me that.

681
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,820
All right, hammer time.

682
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,100
Oh, that's a lot of good shit, too.

683
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,880
Your specials are 25% faster.

684
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,740
Your special gains a power shot.

685
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,160
That DL is 50.

686
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,240
Oh, wait, I should get one, right?

687
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,440
Independent thought.

688
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,280
I don't need to ask you guys.

689
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,000
It mobs.

690
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:19,660
Yeah.

691
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,480
It's okay.

692
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,720
Independent thought Doki is taking control of the wheel now.

693
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,020
This is no longer a chat build.

694
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,820
This is a Doki build.

695
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,080
Oh my gosh.

696
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:34,900
Okay, that's bad.

697
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:35,980
It's just 8 damage.

698
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:46,780
Oh my god, it's no longer I'm just taking shit Frog, your
whole job is to take shit For me

699
01:02:51,880 --> 01:03:04,820
Alright More attack, okay wait, maybe scorch No, attack
Yeah, more attack More damage equals more power More damage

700
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:11,220
equals they die fast I mean, yeah, we'll grab the prophecy
now.

701
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,620
We'll grab this too.

702
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,700
All in!

703
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,040
All right.

704
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,780
Watch this.

705
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:21,780
Boom!

706
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,700
They're just chilling.

707
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,140
They're just hanging out with their buddies.

708
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,200
Goodness.

709
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:32,900
That's right.

710
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,620
Oh shit, that's not right!

711
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,520
I got an overconfident in there.

712
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,380
Alright, more ash.

713
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,640
Thunder!

714
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,320
Yeah, this is my burn everything build.

715
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,480
I think it's working, guys.

716
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,840
Burning is one of the worst deaths of possible.

717
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,760
So I think it's working.

718
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,260
If they all just keep burning, they'll die eventually.

719
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:05,420
Right?

720
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:20,720

for myself yay arson what's the saying thank you for uh

721
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:28,480
welcome to tomato farm welcome welcome your special inflicts
blitz that's my right click after you take damage when you

722
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:37,320
use a random surrounding foe is struck by i'm always using
magic I do not have enough money.

723
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:38,600
It's okay.

724
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,580
I'm going to start.

725
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,780
This is a weird magic build that I'm doing.

726
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,380
I'm very surprised that independent thought Doki has leaned
towards magic.

727
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,400
Just keeping tabs on everyone, I guess.

728
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,100
All right.

729
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,040
I don't know how to feel about that.

730
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:05,520
I don't know how to feel that independent thought Doki is
using magic right now.

731
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,080
I'll do faster.

732
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,060
And we're off.

733
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,020
And we're off.

734
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,140
If Lepreidokie becomes a nerd.

735
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,920
Who are you?

736
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,460
Yeah, I brought my frog to the foot.

737
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,900
I never trust appearances entirely headmistress.

738
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,220
And no, neither do you.

739
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,620
This must be an exciting night for Freenos.

740
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,740
We are not here to entertain your woodland friends,
Malinois.

741
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,400
It truly is a Christmas miracle

742
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:57,980
Go ahead See me Oh my god, I thought you were supposed to
take damage for me What the fuck

743
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,000
Yeah All right, it's fine.

744
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,540
What the fuck I've not I've never seen this attack before
before.

745
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,360
Oh my god, I've missed everyone.

746
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,070
There you go.

747
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:23,250
Oh shit.

748
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,310
I was not expecting that.

749
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,470
Oh, not you.

750
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:30,310
Oh, there you are.

751
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,010
Oh my god.

752
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,250
Are you fucking kidding me?

753
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,630
Oh, it's okay.

754
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:35,710
My frog.

755
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,390
What?

756
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:38,390
Okay.

757
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,270
Okay.

758
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,250
You're just gonna.

759
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:40,730
Okay.

760
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,350
You're Just gonna stand there?

761
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:43,350
Oh, that's cool.

762
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,470
Why don't I...

763
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:44,850
Alright.

764
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,910
They told me this was an auto attack, but I guess they were
wrong.

765
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:53,970
I literally...

766
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:59,770
I literally did that because I assumed that it was an auto
attack.

767
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,310
But I guess I was wrong.

768
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:08,470
I guess people are liars.

769
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:09,930
Who would have thought...

770
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,070
Okay, this should be how he dies.

771
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,970
Oh, I have to stand behind.

772
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,110
I was told it was an auto attack.

773
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:27,250
I cannot manage your wounds and neither show your enemies.

774
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,250
All right, nice.

775
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,430
Chat always.

776
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,190
One speaks lies, the other tells truth.

777
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:37,630
You gotta check who's the one guy.

778
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,010
Your job is to figure out who's the one guy.

779
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,570
Who is the one guy?

780
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:45,770
Alright.

781
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,810
Oh wait, what's this?

782
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:48,530
Money.

783
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,150
Alright.

784
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:54,810
We'll grab the stone now.

785
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:59,270
Uh, gain plus two now?

786
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,490
Mystery seeds.

Ensure that- okay, yeah, I want to ensure that- Oh, nice!

788
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,870

because it's like water enemies guys they're all water so I

792
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,640
thought he was also water

793
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:08,460
but I don't know if right click is like strong enough I feel
like my attack is like the best one there you go for five

for yourself, guys.

801
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,380
Thinking for yourself is a mistake.

802
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,440
Okay.

803
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,980
Oh my god, I'm losing track.

804
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,520
Which one's mine and which one's not mine?

805
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:35,700
Summon!

806
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,940
Oh my god, I don't know.

807
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,000
Is he... Is he... Is that the enemy?

tp plate at contest point in overtime is allowed oh okay
sorry i had to know there was a fucking at.

812
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:18,080
Knock foes.

813
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,040
When you sprint, your special hits a...

814
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,620
Like, a moose, press, and hood.

815
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:23,600
Or...

816
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,540
I mean, I've been using magic a lot.

817
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,480
Oh, yay!

818
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,880
I got two!

819
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,400
Two for one special!

820
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,560
That's crazy.

821
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,860
I'm actually going full on with magic.

822
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,680
Like, accidentally, too.

823
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,060
It's...

824
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,760
There you go.

825
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,480
Yeah.

826
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,620
You guys just get revived.

827
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:00,780
All right.

828
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,340
Let's see.

829
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:08,180
If the foe is near after your dash, you can do a blast, your
attacks and special do more damage to armor.

830
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,690
At the start of each encounter.

831
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,830
Is this like each room?

832
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:17,070
Okay, I'm not...

833
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,270
I'm so free will, but I want to know, is that like...

834
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,950
Oh, but I don't take damage that easily.

835
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:27,890
But the thing is, guys, I don't take damage like instantly.

836
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,030
I take damage over time because I start panicking.

837
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,050
Yeah, I think I'm going to do armor.

838
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:42,190
If it was near after you dash, you can cause a blast at you.

839
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,830
I feel like...

840
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:46,750
Fuck armor.

841
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:48,990
Oh, I'll just...

842
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,490
Let's unlock this just in case.

843
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:52,410
Yeah, see?

844
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:53,190
Look at that.

845
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,270
So efficient.

846
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:54,790
Whoa!

847
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:58,990
It's so very efficient.

848
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,310
Okay.

849
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:06,010
Not wrong, it's so very efficient, guys.

850
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,330
Oh, hey, narcissist.

851
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:11,050
Let's go talk to my boy narcissist.

852
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,130
So I was like, no way.

853
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,190
Instead I go, wait.

854
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:15,150
Into the post?

855
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:22,770
suitors hello i can tell you're having trouble moving on
maybe you ought to spend a little time down in the fields

856
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:30,310
clear your head put the pieces of your heart back together
and all that my team loses because i play hades it's not

857
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,350
because i played hades

858
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:47,370
i will say it's not because i played hades there is one who
repeats whatever i said to her warming up and not me doing

859
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:48,070
the 80s.

860
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,010
She really.

861
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,710
Only ever talked about herself.

862
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,770
I had to cut her off.

863
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:02,170
How dare she only talk about herself when you have
narcissists right in front of you.

864
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,290
So you do know Echo, the mountain nymph.

865
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,670
She's languishing in the fields even now.

866
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,150
Apparently because of you.

867
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:10,070
I can hardly get through to her.

868
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:12,790
Yeah, I'm warming up my APM, guys.

869
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:14,930
Oh, that's too bad.

870
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:23,330
tell her narcissists really wants what's best for her unless
that's me don't tell her that part though all right let's

871
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:35,830

874
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:06,960
oh hey sister her cousin i like how you came over here when
the fight is about to end and then take all the credit being

875
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,680

876
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:25,820
I feel like the casting thing is not doing that much as much
as I thought it would oh my god I'm taking a lot of damage

877
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:33,840
right now where is she she's not gonna say hi hello have I
gifted her yet it's been a pleasure to have worked more

878
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,920
closely with you sister yeah are the miss this is hardly
worth the gift of impeccable precision though I wanted you

879
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:48,440
to have it traditions now are we well sure then i accept
your offering sister melena we and i've been offering for

881
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:05,140
yippee about the fates that chronos somehow got to them
doesn't want to take any chances anymore did the fates

882
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:13,320
prophesize their own captivity yeah if they knew they were
going to get kidnapped why don't they just knock How can you

883
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,700
be so casual about this?

884
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,560
If the fates themselves couldn't stop Kronos, we won't have
an easy time.

885
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,200
This is the new Lunar Skin.

886
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:21,880
It's the new game mode.

887
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,300
In the 5.5 update, they added a new game mode.

888
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,940
It's now a roguelike.

889
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,420
All right.

890
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,800
Clothes in your cast may take critical damage.

891
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,320
A piercing arrow fires towards any clothes damaged by your
cast.

892
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,260
Oh, it's 50.

893
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,240
Wait, after you hit with your attack or special?

894
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,280
Wait, every attack or special?

895
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:51,320
Please support fire.

896
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,200
I think like every attack or special is pretty OP.

897
01:16:59,400 --> 01:16:59,840
Okay.

898
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,040
I don't think we need to sacrifice anything.

899
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,600
Oh, hey, let's grab some money too.

900
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:04,960
We're a little bit broke.

901
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:05,880
Might as well.

902
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,460
Yeah, like, that's a lot of arrows.

903
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,340
Yeah.

904
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,360
Proof implant money.

905
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,880
Thank you, Tonator, for the super chat.

906
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,040
Thank you, thank you.

907
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,680
I really appreciate it.

908
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,420
Thank you so much.

909
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:24,960
Oh, hey.

910
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:25,880
Fishing time.

911
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:27,980
Let's fish.

912
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,060
What did I get?

913
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:33,680
What?

914
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,640
How did it escape?

915
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,000
I did it instantly.

916
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,800
Alright, your splash effects also inflict...

917
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,380
Oh, Froth.

918
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,940
I have no idea what that means.

919
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:55,340
all right let's go okay we are i don't even i think my build

hate you you know those people that are like i've hated this

01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:24,260

924
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:51,940

925
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:57,200
Whoa, fuck, okay, this is, oh my god, I'm getting hit by
everything.

926
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,840
I'm sorry, death defiance!

927
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:02,680
Oh, guys, independent fought is actually a mistake right
now.

928
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,960
I'm getting hit by everything.

929
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,680
Okay, there you go.

930
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,660
I don't know how I'm doing it.

931
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:16,520
Come on.

932
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,260
Open up.

933
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,300
Open up.

934
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,200
Oh my god.

935
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,440
I...

936
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,420
Look, I'm trying to also...

937
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:24,960
Guys, okay.

938
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,480
To be fair, I'm also trying my best to make this a fast run.

939
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,560
And by fast run, I guess I've been dying as fast as I can.

940
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:34,760
Like...

941
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,100
I just didn't realize that, man, I'm trying to die.

942
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,400
That was an accident.

943
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,720
That was not intentional.

944
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

945
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,380
Oh my god.

946
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:52,820
Okay, death defiance.

947
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,180
I lost both death defiance.

948
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,820
This is the most...

949
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,320
Okay, I might have messed up in...

950
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,460
I definitely messed up in the nerd build.

951
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,520
Alright.

952
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:10,770
Alright, it's fine.

953
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,150
Okay, nerd build might not be it, guys.

954
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,110
Where is the other woman?

955
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,070
Oh, dude.

956
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,450
Are you fucking...

957
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,030
Oh, my God.

958
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,010
Oh, my God.

959
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:28,170
Oh, my God.

960
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:28,810
Okay, it's okay.

961
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:31,490
It's okay.

962
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,730
It's okay.

963
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:38,310
Nerd build might not be the smartest thing I've done today.

964
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:45,130
I've literally lost two death defi- I've not ever lost two
death defiances before.

965
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,250
I forgot about my...

Doki's plan.

969
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:26,570
Where am I supposed to go?

970
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:31,170
I think the issue with the scourge is that it definitely
does not fucking...

971
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:36,530
It does not stop people.

972
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,350
That's a little concerning.

973
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:49,130
Yeah, I thought it would stop, but it doesn't stop people.

974
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,350
I'm pretty sure I messed up that fucking build.

975
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:00,350
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is not how the build is supposed
to go

976
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:07,410
All right Got wolf guy here.

977
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:08,090
He's going.

978
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:09,170
He's trying to find people.

979
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:10,350
He's sniffing them out.

980
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:11,390
Where are they boy?

981
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:15,730
Okay, he does not know where people are I was wrong.

982
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:20,490
He is very confused Hey, there's a plant though

983
01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:32,690
Yeah I don't know you're doing damage Yeah, but it's not
really doing damage.

984
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:34,230
Oh, shit.

985
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:38,910
I forgot about the thing about magic build is that you're
very weak.

986
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:39,690
You're...

987
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:44,350
You have the damage, but you're very, very weak.

988
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,470
As per normal magic builds.

989
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,900
Alright, let's see.

990
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,640
What does it say?

991
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,300
Use Q for the binding or hold.

992
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,400
Oh, you're raised servants.

993
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:01,980

She hates you!

1002
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:52,210
Okay.

1003
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,130
Oh, I could summon another one!

1004
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,150
Oh, it's the same one.

1005
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,230
It's the same one.

1006
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,170
There you go.

1007
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,690
So I'm this.

1008
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,570
Yeah, do something, frog.

01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,730
Yeah, plus 40.

1010
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,910
I like how it does it automatically now.

1011
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:16,850
Your strikes?

1012
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,490
Oh, okay.

1013
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,950
But you prom 50.

1014
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:21,690
Hold cast to aim where the bottom circle appears.

1015
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,950
Oh, wait, I like that.

1016
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,970
That's my favorite one.

1017
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,410
Oh, I'm going to do rushing.

1018
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:30,410
I'm going to do this so I can chuck it somewhere.

1019
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:31,930
Oh, and I get Echo, too.

1020
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:32,470
Yeah!

1021
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:39,100
All right, Echo, I talked to Narcissus.

1022
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,120
I mean, I think he's sorry.

1023
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,160
I think he's sorry.

1024
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,320
Yeah, it's just you talk too much about yourself.

1025
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,120
Like, think about others, Echo.

1026
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,940
That he remembers you, and he didn't mean to hurt you.

1027
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,580
Yeah, he just loves himself.

1028
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,960
I think he just, are not enough for him.

1029
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,860
Sorry to say.

1030
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,900
Yeah, you got it, girl.

1031
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:02,680
You got it.

1032
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,300
There's just not enough space in his heart.

1033
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,660
For more than him.

1034
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,420
All spent.

1035
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,920
With ones that restore.

1036
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:17,960
Oh.

1037
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,420
Double the level of.

1038
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,180
Palms.

1039
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,200
I feel like Palms are always the best one.

1040
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:24,340
Dude.

1041
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,660
I don't need death defiance.

1042
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:26,440
Fuck it.

1043
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,420
I don't need death defiance.

1044
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,500
I don't need it.

1045
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,920
This is the run.

1046
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,840
I- more damage!

1047
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:41,900
Uh...

1048
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:42,720
Oh wait, lightning.

1049
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,320
Hammer.

1050
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,580
The famous last words.

1051
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:53,720
Who needs death defies when I can just live?

1052
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,100
Okay.

1053
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,600
I still can't believe where our matches don't start.

1054
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,680
One hour!

1055
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,180
I still can't believe I had to wait.

1056
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,620
Not an hour and a half.

1057
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,580
I think that's the worst part.

1058
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,920
The end half part.

1059
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,220
I didn't expect the end half.

1060
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:25,500
There you go.

1061
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,260
Alright, I could summon another one.

1062
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,200
Yeah, end half.

1063
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,800
It's not just an hour.

1064
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:41,320
It's the end half part.

1065
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:41,600
Alright.

1066
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,100
Let's clear it up.

1067
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,220
Um, prop damage.

1068
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,560
Let's do 100%.

1069
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:48,760
Wait.

1070
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:49,360
Mmm.

1071
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,340
Oh yeah, 100%.

1072
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,700
That was a tree anywhere?

1073
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,340
Trees?

1074
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,100
Oh here.

1075
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,220
Let's grab the hammer.

1076
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:03,920
This corruption.

1077
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,380
Alright, there you go.

1078
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,360
Oh shit, I didn't even see that guy.

1079
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,500
There you go.

1080
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,400
That's right.

1081
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,380
I got the Medusa now.

1082
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,660
Okay, it's fine.

1083
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,860
Gotta regen them.

1084
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,000
Oh my god, these guys weren't even part of the fight.

1085
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:31,120
I just went in there and be like, you go and... You go die
too, I guess.

1086
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:32,940
Nice.

1087
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:35,940
Hammer time!

1088
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,380
Uh, your attacks were 50%.

1089
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,940
Oh, your attacks hit two times, but use Oh, fuck.

1090
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:44,580
Okay.

1091
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:46,940
Uh...

1092
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,000
I've been using...

1093
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,380
Okay.

1094
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,600
What to use?

1095
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:58,160
I feel like 50% faster is better, because I do have the
arrows.

1096
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:03,620
Oh, I do use Enchana into your special.

1097
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:04,720
What's my special?

1098
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,400
I don't use special enough.

1099
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,560
I'm gonna get faster.

1100
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,780
Yeah, so I can put more arrows in.

1101
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,160
into.

1102
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,860
Where are the fucking trees?

1103
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,120
Where are the trees?

1104
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:23,820
I'm missing one more.

1105
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,420
What the fuck is the last one?

1106
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:29,880
Oh my god.

1107
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,300
How am I supposed to complete this run before my game?

1108
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:32,900
Oh.

1109
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,740
This is not related.

1110
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,740
Oh wait, is this related?

1111
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,080
What's the end?

1112
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,200
Your race take any damage.

1113
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,300
You race her and steal.

1114
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,500
Oh, first time they hit?

1115
01:28:45,040 --> 01:29:01,240
that oh I guess I'm not grabbing that all right my bad I'm
not grabbing that apparently did I do it no fuck that

1116
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:05,860

here

01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:19,530
what the fuck where's the last one oh it's right here I hear
it.

1118
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:20,890
I hear the glowing sound.

1119
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:23,130
Oh my god.

1120
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,270
Wait, I don't hear it.

1121
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,450
I drifted.

1122
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,750
Welcome to tomato fire.

1123
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:27,710
Welcome, welcome.

1124
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,830
Wait, I don't.

1125
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:29,750
Oh, wait.

1126
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,230
Here it is.

1127
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:33,070
Okay, that was a problem.

1128
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,710
Okay, it's right here.

1129
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:40,950
There we go.

1130
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:41,850
Oh, wait.

1131
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:42,450
Raise!

1132
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:43,650
That's right.

1133
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,330
Start punching.

1134
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:47,470
There we go.

1135
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:48,790
That's right.

1136
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:49,490
Keep punching.

1137
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:50,850
Oh my god.

1138
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:51,910
Oh my god.

1139
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:52,870
don't have any.

1140
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:55,590
I don't have any more magic.

1141
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:57,230
I don't understand.

1142
01:29:57,690 --> 01:30:00,530
How do I not have any more magic in my magic build?

1143
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:02,210
It's okay.

1144
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,270
I got more.

1145
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,950
Uh, chopper hef.

1146
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:10,910
Uh, fuck.

1147
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:11,230
Okay.

1148
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,590
Uh, I don't have a lot of money, technically.

1149
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:18,270
So we will go with hef.

1150
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:19,530
I don't have a lot of money.

1151
01:30:19,570 --> 01:30:23,270
I don't think broke right now.

1152
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,130
Your flow is near.

1153
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:30,290
You can blast whenever you enter a game thing.

1154
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:32,050
Game 10.

1155
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:34,130
Based on 20%.

1156
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:35,170
I don't even have armor.

1157
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:36,290
I'm just going to go with that.

1158
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:38,790
Alright, dog time.

1159
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:41,250
There is a chance I'll die.

1160
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:52,070
There might be there is a possibility where I just fucking
die.

1161
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,090
Okay, it's fine.

1162
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:04,870
Okay, it's fine.

1163
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:08,610
Oh my god.

1164
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:10,430
Oh my god, it's okay.

1165
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:12,510
He doesn't know.

1166
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,010
What's the use?

1167
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:15,150
Oh, what?

1168
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:16,430
Okay.

1169
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:20,090
Okay.

1170
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:22,310
Are you fucked?

1171
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:23,390
Oh my god.

1172
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:24,150
Oh my god.

1173
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:25,750
Okay, that was an accident.

1174
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:28,950
Oh, my God!

1175
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,710
Yeah, stop!

1176
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:35,050
Stop!

1177
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:36,410
Oh!

1178
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:37,490
Stop!

1179
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:43,530
Okay, I don't know what I'm summoning.

1180
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:44,270
Okay, that's fine.

1181
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,970
Okay, that's fine.

1182
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:53,220
Okay.

1183
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:54,540
It's okay.

1184
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,220
Oh, I am not okay.

1185
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:58,560
It's okay.

1186
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,580
that are summoning.

1187
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,060
Oh my god, it is not okay.

1188
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,720
It is not okay.

1189
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:08,620
Oh my god.

1190
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,600
Guys, free will might have been a mistake.

1191
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:21,920
There is a possibility that I might have messed up by trying
to have free will.

1192
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,160
Okay.

1193
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,260
I'm just gonna be here.

1194
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:37,180
Oh god.

1195
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:41,510
I just gotta...

1196
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,910
I gotta be very far away.

1197
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:47,570
He's very slowly coming towards me and I'm scared.

1198
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:53,150
Where is he going?

1199
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:55,890
Are you fucking kidding me?

1200
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:56,890
Oh my god.

1201
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,430
Okay, wait, wait, wait!

1202
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:00,810
Oh!

1203
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,530
It was close!

1204
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,880
Oh, that was close.

1205
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,320
That was very close.

1206
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:11,200
Alright.

1207
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,140
We're fine.

1208
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,580
He hit me.

1209
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:16,460
I hit him.

1210
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,940
I have...

1211
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:18,620
Be sued.

1212
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,700
I have 3 HP.

1213
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,300
But we...

1214
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,360
We're alive.

1215
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,640
We're alive.

1216
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,280
We made it.

1217
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,420
3 HP and a goddamn dream.

1218
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:33,300
I...

1219
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,380
Ha ha ha ha.

1220
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,920
I saw the minus 20 and I was like, I don't know.

1221
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,740
And we're cutting a little too close right now.

1222
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:43,760
What's this?

1223
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,280
We're going to gain 20% or limited 30 HP.

1224
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,000
Yeah, no.

1225
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:48,880
All right.

1226
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,040
Receive gain.

1227
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:54,300
All right, let's grab this real quick.

1228
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,180
Let's grab as much HP as possible.

1229
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,940
Kronos awaits.

1230
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:02,780
All right.

1231
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:04,880
Kronos time.

1232
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:05,780
Yeah, no.

1233
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,420
I...

1234
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,040
My build is not great.

1235
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,460
I might have messed up.

1236
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:15,500
I might have messed up on my build.

1237
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,260
Definitely could be better.

1238
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:30,820
Okay.

1239
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:33,820
There you go.

01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,000
Yeah, 100%.

1241
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,420

Where's my summons?

1256
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,780
It's okay, I just summoned him again.

1257
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,300
I wish I could summon more than once.

1258
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:16,900
Like, more than one enemy?

1259
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,100
If I just build it enough?

1260
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,520
Where the fuck is the exit?

1261
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:22,900

Oh, it's over here.

1263
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,960
I feel like it'd be cool.

1264
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,280
I feel like...

1265
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,700
I mean, it might be OP, but look at me.

1266
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,620
I don't think I'm OP right now.

1267
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,240
I...

1268
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,760
Not this build.

1269
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:42,140
If I had the right build, maybe.

1270
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,720
This does not seem very...

1271
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:45,940
OP right now.

1272
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:54,030
Is that it?

1273
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:55,130
No, there's that guy.

1274
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:56,630

01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,190

1277
01:36:59,150 --> 01:36:59,750
That's right.

1278
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:00,490
Oh my god.

1279
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:01,810
You can't even hit your brother.

1280
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:03,610
Just a few chambers left.

1281
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:04,350
Alright.

1282
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:05,810
Asylum.

1283
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:08,230

01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:56,780
You still have HP.

1293
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,280
Jesus Christ.

1294
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,900
Why much prefer silver?

1295
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,520
Although it also took the wisdom of my noble brother Zeus,
who formed the pan.

1296
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,200
Oh, no.

1297
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:12,360

01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:17,260
Oh, it's a duo.

1300
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,480
It's a duo.

1301
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:19,800
Oh, yeah, because he was talking.

Two Hades, two Hades facts.

1313
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:47,380
Melanoi shares a voice actor with Luna Snow and Serber is
voiced by Devs Dogs.

1314
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,340

1337
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,680
It's fine.

1338
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:56,240

1339
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:00,000

01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,160

1345
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,200

1346
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,100

1357
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:35,930
The death defiance.

1358

All right, okay, guys, guys.

1359
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:37,830

1361
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,230
Everything's okay.

1362
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:47,570
We have another death defiance.

1363
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,170
Not all hope is lost.

1364
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:52,870
Oh my god.

1365
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:55,810

Oh my god.

1368
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:03,370
I wish like, I wish it's a different color.

1369
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:05,770
Like when you're minions, like you have a minion.

1370
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:09,550
It's a different color because I'm like, it's a friend or
bro.

1371
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:11,730
But all you see is a tiny ass heart.

1372
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:14,270
The heart is so tiny.

1373
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:15,130
I can't tell.

1374
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,270
I have a thousand dollars though.

1375
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:16,610
Yeah.

1376
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:19,570
6 HP and a dream.

1377
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:23,350
Okay.

1378
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:24,670

Five.

1380
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:28,890
A thousand.

1381
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:31,650
Okay.

1382
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:33,010
Hmm.

1383
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,490
Why is there no HP?

1384
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:39,470
Why is there no HP?

1385
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,850
It feels good to be working together with that one again.

1386
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:42,930
You tell him I said.

1387
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:47,570

01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:52,610

We'll just...

1394
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:36,450
A bit too late.

1395
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:44,690
I mean, I have so much magic.

1396
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:46,290
Maybe that's good.

1397
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:49,090
For 10 seconds.

1398
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:51,130
10 seconds against...

1399
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:51,730
You know what?

1400
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:57,070
10 seconds against Grandpa might be enough.

1401
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,610
Might be enough.

1402
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:08,130
There's surrounding foes with powerful flash as they start
to strike, but you prime 30.

1403
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:11,630
Yeah, we're at the, we're apparently the third match.

1404
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,570
Don't, don't worry, we have time.

1405
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:20,730
Um, yeah, but then like, this is over top.

1406
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:22,610
You know what, this, we'll do that.

1407
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:28,630
Okay, we have, we have a bit more armor now.

1408
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:32,710
I think we're gonna die.

1409
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:36,070
Unless I locked in.

1410
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:42,090
You were never meant to be involved in this granddaughter.

1411
01:43:43,070 --> 01:43:45,550
You must have been a mere babe when first I arrived here.

1412
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:47,090
Alas, too late to meet.

1413
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:49,890
Yet even now, you are too young to understand.

1414
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:53,050
I would have been imprisoned with the rest.

1415
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:56,590
Yeah, you would have kept the baby in the jail.

1416
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,470
In the baby jail.

1417
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:07,630
young to understand the disappointment and dejection that
only family can provide but the more of us you meet the more

1418
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:13,510
of us you know the sooner you shall learn i hear you

I just tanked it all.

1423
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:49,720
Guys, guys, I don't think I'm locking it in.

1424
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,860
For some reason, it does not feel like I'm locked in.

1425
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,200
Oh, shit.

1426
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,160
Okay, it's okay.

1428
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,300
I gotta get rid of these, though.

1429
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:15,680
Oh, shit.

1430
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,100
It's okay.

1431
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,880
I just got rid of these.

1432
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:23,440
Okay.

It was a mistake.

1456
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,120
Independent thought was a mistake.

1457
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,340
Dude, you're going to crush it in the tournament now.

1458

1464
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:27,300
26 miss.

1465
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,140
That's like the worst one yet.

Alright, let's grab this.

1467

1468
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,960
The Hades 2, the next Hades 2 stream people are going to be
confused.

1469
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,240
They're like, I feel like we missed one giant chunk of
dialogue.

1470
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:48,660
Alright, let's go in.

1471
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,020
To the abyss of the subconscious, I descend.

1472
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:55,780
No!

1473
01:48:56,120 --> 01:49:00,280
Because they want to fucking watch every game i don't know
why

1474

there's like there's too many teams to spectate every game i

I assume.

1521
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:15,390
God, this schedule looks so fucking confusing to me.

1522
01:55:17,730 --> 01:55:19,090
I'm like looking at this.

1523
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:20,890
I'm like, I'm so confused.

1524
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:22,210
All right.

1525
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:25,910
We're going to look at this together.

1526
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:27,610
We're figuring this out together, chat.

1527
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:28,990
This is a group effort now.

1528
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:31,710
I'll fucking decipher this.

1529
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:36,490
Okay, so.

1530
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:39,170
6.30 p.m.

1531
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:40,350
EST.

1532
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:44,290
That's 3.30 p.m.

1533
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:46,830
That we should make it, right?

1534
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:49,550
We should make it.

1535
01:55:49,630 --> 01:55:50,810
If it's 6.6.30.

1536
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,930
Oh, it's best.

1537
01:55:53,150 --> 01:55:53,810
Oh, my gosh.

1538
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:54,690
It's best to see.

1539
01:55:55,510 --> 01:55:56,150
Yeah.

1540
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:57,630
So it's 3.30.

1541
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:59,330
So.

1542
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:01,270
I should make it.

1543
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:03,290
I mean, at best I'll make it by 430.

1544
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:06,070
I'll be like, my hard stop is 430.

1545
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:07,090
I'll say that.

1546
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:18,070
I'll be like, uh, um, I'll be like, uh, is anyone ending
before 430 p.m.

1547
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:18,710
That's it.

1548
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:20,690
It says, so match is going.

1549
01:56:21,010 --> 01:56:24,150
There's, I need to be sure.

1550
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:25,990
Because,

1551
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:36,910
um, because I have to leave exactly at 4 30.

1552
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:48,750
oh oh is it just uh did you get this you have me yeah yeah
nice that was awkward i'd leave exactly because my fine key

1553
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:58,510
is at three at five four i need to make sure because i'd
leave exactly at 4 30 for a contract obligation at an event

1554
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:12,850
before four so I want to be sure that scared me I was like
whoa

1555
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:30,040
um to end before four before four went to decide whether or
not I can whether or not I can I can participate so I want

1556
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,600
to be sure um

1557
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:47,890

there you go i reset my sound thing that scared the shit out

1560
01:58:20,330 --> 01:58:29,570
of me because i I forgot my picking on I forgot my bind key
for this uh Marvel and actually type five because no one

1561
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:35,370
like I rarely ever use the the number five for some fucking
reason and that's why it's on my bind key

1562
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:55,010
all right I'm putting Rivals up Necro's laws can you just
pretend that Oshi bird won the tournament call it the day

02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,400
Oh, that's good.

1600
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:12,220
This is not the majority anymore.

1601
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,100
For better.

1602
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:17,120
Like 200 ping is slightly playable, 250.

1603
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,260
That's like, the game won't even function, I swear.

1604
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,960
Yeah, the 200 ping ain't on my team, so it's fine.

1605
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:24,620
Holy shit.

1606
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,400
Listen, if he my goals, just everyone shoot it.

1607
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:28,800
He won't be able to react, I swear.

1608
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:35,220
This is the majority.

1609
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:36,700
We should keep this.

1610
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:41,800
Like, sucks to be that guy, but, like, you know what you
were getting.

1611
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,820
Like, it's the majority.

1612
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:48,120
Okay, we have advantage.

1613
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:49,160
Nice.

1614
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:50,400
Yes, yes.

1615
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:53,420
So what's your cope if we lose?

1616
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:54,280
Then, what?

1617
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:57,980
Yeah.

1618
02:04:58,540 --> 02:05:01,340
We just say they have the rank 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 guys.

1619
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,460
That's true.

1620
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:07,180
Tournaments like these people always get so salty about
ping.

1621
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:09,380
I hope I have nobody gets salty.

1622
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:12,660
I like not tournament like these it's all tournaments.

1623
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:22,020
Every tournament with a prize pool people will get salty.

1624
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:23,820
Yeah they have one.

1625
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:26,640
Yeah guys this team has ranked one, two, three, four and
five.

1626
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:27,860
Which one is it?

1627
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:28,800
It's one guy.

1628
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:30,240
It's literally one guy.

1629
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:40,480
i wish i wish too i always get like plus 30 ping on every
yeah yeah why don't we go to a region though because there's

1630
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:46,880
not enough players there won't be enough players for a
tournament that's the thing for me they need it's better

1631
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:56,100
really it's wait how is dallas better for you there's not
enough days in general i don't understand way it was for me

1632
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:04,300
again but i guess it's playable oh i mean makes sense it's
because it's going like the opposite direction goes with the

1633
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:12,560
Australia right yeah there is a prize pool yeah there is
it's like what is it 25k tournament so I mean I'll check it

1634
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:23,980
it's actually no Virginia Bella oh he joined for fun I don't
really care much about the prize pool first prize is 12k

1635
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:29,960
second but it's divided by six players by the way so I mean
it's still a lot of money I will say it's still a lot of

1636
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:40,640
money first place is 6k second place is 6k of 12 my first
place is 12k second place is 6k um third place is 5k four

1637
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:50,180
places three k and then fifth place is 1k plus 2500 blue
coins or blue code what left east codes really is called and

1638
02:06:50,180 --> 02:07:00,560
then six then eight is just 1k i mean if they go go
singapore yeah it's 2k for each okay we're doing all right

1639
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:06,160
god i need a p I think I can no Any thoughts on what we want
to protect I will say

1640
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:16,440
Specifically if you think It's where we guys want I'm first
talking Just play like any DPS so I think you guys protect

1641
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:22,380
DPS Because they don't really specialize If you think about
it The more you hold The more locked in you are But like

1642
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:30,820
don't hold it for too long Because that's not how's it How's

02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:20,830
No, lucky seal will play it Okay Made it back just in time
He plays Bucky.

1686
02:10:21,150 --> 02:10:26,530
Yeah, I forgot the bad face for this is very long guys It
doesn't matter whether I'm here or not guys.

It's okay Also, I brought everyone down a little bit I have

1688
02:10:41,110 --> 02:10:43,650

1689
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:45,670
Could be rockets if you wanted to.

1690
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:49,910
I'm the he-haha content creator.

1691
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:55,710
Poor villain.

1692
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:56,550
I'm not judging.

1693
02:10:57,150 --> 02:10:58,850
So what do I play here?

1694
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:02,170
Probably Sue, especially if they're going to play the wolf.

1695
02:11:05,070 --> 02:11:07,390
Either do wolf, maybe I go Bucky instead of Hella.

1696
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:08,690
What do we think?

1697
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:11,670
We want Hella or Bucky here.

1698
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:23,790
start i have no opinion yeah i think the most broken
character is star in this meta wait yeah actually you're

1699
02:11:23,790 --> 02:11:30,830
right you're right you're right you're right i'll play i'm

it though oh no no they don't have a star oh my god we have

1701

Just keep laying on points.

1788
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,690

I'm gonna go Hella.

1790
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:45,490
You're still hot first though.

1791
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:47,490
They have Gambit, Iron Fist.

1792
02:14:50,070 --> 02:14:50,470
Rogue.

1793
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:52,710
I think...

1794
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,270
Be really careful.

1795
02:14:53,370 --> 02:14:55,610
They're gonna go really, really fast with Gambit, okay?

1796
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:57,010
Yeah, they have the Roku.

1797
02:14:57,710 --> 02:14:59,010
They're really slow here.

1798
02:14:59,250 --> 02:14:59,730
Really slow here.

1799
02:15:00,130 --> 02:15:01,690
Okay, take damage from me, but be really slow.

I might need heals.

1853
02:16:10,010 --> 02:16:11,190
Gambit, Fist, Bucky.

1854
02:16:11,350 --> 02:16:13,130
They have Iron Fist too.

1855
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:16,170
I'm just gonna try to force Invisal soon, yeah.

1856

02:16:35,390 --> 02:16:35,870
Oh, Fist left.

1873

Good grab, good grab.

1874
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:38,930
They only use Fist.

1875
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:41,250
Listen, they have Gambit before me, okay?

1876
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:43,790
We can take damage for you.

1877
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:44,270

1878
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:47,550
Where are they going?

This is a touch, I think.

1886
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:54,670
No block.

1887
02:16:55,870 --> 02:16:57,390
I'm looking Fist.

1888
02:16:57,410 --> 02:16:58,230

1889
02:16:58,690 --> 02:16:59,230

02:20:50,730 --> 02:20:50,910
Both?

1989
02:20:51,130 --> 02:20:51,930
Yeah, they're both.

1990
02:20:52,070 --> 02:20:52,350
They're both.

1991
02:20:52,590 --> 02:20:54,650
Okay, I'll just go and text them.

1992
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:55,070
Okay.

1993
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:57,210
I'm still 80 right now.

1994
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:58,670
Wait, make them more kill, Captain.

1995
02:20:58,830 --> 02:21:00,310
I'll go when they come to Chelsea.

1996
02:21:00,450 --> 02:21:00,770
83.

1997
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:02,690
I'm ulting in 3, 2, 1.

1998
02:21:03,430 --> 02:21:04,590
I'm going to kill you.

1999
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:04,990
Me?

2000
02:21:05,430 --> 02:21:06,860
Oh, 94, 95.

2001
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:09,370
I got it.

2002
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:10,790
It's huge.

2003
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:12,210
I have the back.

2004
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:14,510
Me too.

2005
02:21:14,850 --> 02:21:14,910
I got the back.

2006
02:21:14,910 --> 02:21:15,010
Yeah, I'm cutting.

2007
02:21:15,510 --> 02:21:16,030
I got pulled.

2008
02:21:16,150 --> 02:21:16,990
I got pulled for it.

2009
02:21:17,310 --> 02:21:18,150
She's on me.

2010
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:19,670
Yeah, I'm dead.

2011
02:21:21,770 --> 02:21:22,190
Let's go.

2012
02:21:22,210 --> 02:21:22,710
I'm gonna try and stall.

2013
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:25,110
Yeah, I'll stall down as I can.

2014
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:28,490
And he's dead, boy.

2015
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:28,770
That was a bad.

2016
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:29,390
They used a lot.

2017
02:21:31,350 --> 02:21:31,970
Yeah, they did.

2018
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:33,270
Yeah, we have stall on the gambit.

2019
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:36,990
They use double support, Starlord, Bucky and what else?

2020
02:21:37,630 --> 02:21:37,830
Emma.

2021
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:38,890
They smash Emma.

2022
02:21:39,870 --> 02:21:39,970
Emma.

2023
02:21:40,210 --> 02:21:41,190
Emma is...

2024
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,910
So only Rogue?

2025
02:21:42,610 --> 02:21:43,430
Only Rogue, I think.

2026
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:46,050
And let's listen, make my own, I think we...

2027
02:21:46,050 --> 02:21:46,490
Yeah, yeah.

2028
02:21:46,750 --> 02:21:47,470
Oh, nice.

2029
02:21:47,730 --> 02:21:48,950
Now you just get Rogo, get Rogo.

2030
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:50,150
Don't get too excited.

2031
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:50,810
Rogue, Rogue, Rogue.

2032
02:21:51,130 --> 02:21:51,890
One HP, one HP, one HP.

2033
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:52,010
One HP, one HP.

2034
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:52,430
You can die, you die.

2035
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:53,650
That was good.

2036
02:21:54,010 --> 02:21:54,750
I'm grabbing their Gambit.

2037
02:21:54,950 --> 02:21:55,590
You can kill the Rogue.

2038
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:57,290
I'm holding him.

2039
02:21:57,690 --> 02:21:57,910
What?

2040
02:21:58,410 --> 02:21:58,990
Gambit Antit.

2041
02:21:59,050 --> 02:21:59,450
Gambit Antit.

2042
02:21:59,890 --> 02:22:00,230
Have HP.

2043
02:22:00,710 --> 02:22:01,270
That's 2-1-2.

2044
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:02,370
I put someone back.

2045
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:02,850
I don't know who.

2046
02:22:03,390 --> 02:22:04,290
M1, M1.

2047
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:05,030
M1.

2048
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:08,770
We still have Zarlow.

2049
02:22:10,430 --> 02:22:10,790
Excellent.

2050
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:12,270
I still have Volt as well.

2051
02:22:14,290 --> 02:22:15,330
We need to poke up there.

2052
02:22:15,510 --> 02:22:16,130
They're portally.

2053
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:16,750
They're portally.

2054
02:22:17,850 --> 02:22:18,530
Yeah, strange.

2055
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:19,410
I'm just playing from out here.

2056
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:21,410
They won't have Invis ult, so I'll just go for...

2057
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:23,270
Yeah, I'll go on the suit really hard.

2058
02:22:23,650 --> 02:22:24,690
Okay, I'll go on main.

2059
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:25,210
I'll go on main.

2060
02:22:25,730 --> 02:22:27,410
I'm going to in three, two, one.

2061
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:27,690
I'm on suit.

2062
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:28,950
I'll take one thing.

2063
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:29,850
Oh, he fucking hits away.

2064
02:22:30,390 --> 02:22:31,210
Oh, he canceled it.

2065
02:22:31,490 --> 02:22:32,290
Oh, he canceled it.

2066
02:22:32,290 --> 02:22:33,010
Yeah, that's what I'm here.

2067
02:22:34,030 --> 02:22:35,310
Just reset, reset, it's okay.

2068
02:22:35,710 --> 02:22:36,930
I'm back here.

2069
02:22:37,070 --> 02:22:39,210
I'll just go build up.

2070
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:46,430
They're gonna be 50 there, Gambit.

2071
02:22:46,810 --> 02:22:47,290
Yeah, they'll have.

2072
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:48,790
50 Gambit.

2073
02:22:48,850 --> 02:22:50,170
Wait, what will they have?

2074
02:22:51,050 --> 02:22:51,610
They have Gambit.

2075
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:55,710
I couldn't see if I can cancel with mine.

2076
02:22:56,470 --> 02:22:56,870
I don't think I can.

2077
02:22:56,870 --> 02:22:57,710
I think both support.

2078
02:22:58,610 --> 02:23:00,890
I can use mine to bait and then you can ammo the kite if you
want.

2079
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:02,050
Okay, okay.

2080
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:03,030
I'm gonna start going ready.

2081
02:23:03,210 --> 02:23:04,810
Just walk up three, two, one.

2082
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:06,250
Okay.

2083
02:23:08,470 --> 02:23:10,550
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill,
chill, back, back, back, back, back.

2084
02:23:10,570 --> 02:23:11,250

2085
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:12,670
Yeah, we just live.

2086
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:14,070
Look at Rogue inside us.

2087
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:14,630
Rogue inside us.

2088
02:23:14,890 --> 02:23:15,430
I pulled her back.

2089
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:15,970
I pulled her back.

2090
02:23:16,490 --> 02:23:16,710
I got you.

2091
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:17,530
Big pull.

2092
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:18,370
Styler one, styler one.

2093
02:23:20,570 --> 02:23:20,990
I'm walking on them.

2094
02:23:21,070 --> 02:23:21,290
Those are.

2095
02:23:21,370 --> 02:23:22,170
Styler one, styler one.

2096
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:22,750
I'm on Invis.

2097
02:23:23,330 --> 02:23:23,730
Care I.

2098
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:24,470
They will have I soon.

2099
02:23:25,330 --> 02:23:25,750
Yeah, easy.

2100
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:27,250
I don't have...

2101
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:28,030
I pushed your wish.

2102
02:23:28,430 --> 02:23:28,910
Missed, you missed.

2103
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:29,490
Can you come in?

2104
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:29,870
Can you walk?

2105
02:23:30,130 --> 02:23:31,410
I don't have all of them yet.

2106
02:23:32,210 --> 02:23:32,790
I don't have them here.

2107
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:33,270
I'm moving.

2108
02:23:34,350 --> 02:23:34,750
I'm moving.

2109
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:36,110
I'm waiting.

2110
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:37,030
Let me know when I can go back then.

2111
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:37,570
I can go there.

2112
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:38,770

He's grabbed three, two, one.

2118
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:47,950
We can put three little combo with me.

2119
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:48,630

I can't get you.

2125
02:23:52,630 --> 02:23:53,270

02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:39,390
That guy is practically four of his teammates.

2173
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:42,070
He's a support player, but it still counts.

2174
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:50,450
Yeah, with my default, the King of Akon, yeah.

2175
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:56,150
Yeah, they have all of top five in there.

2176
02:26:01,290 --> 02:26:02,410
Default Andy.

2177
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:06,510
What the fuck?

2178
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:09,490

Everyone is banging in the past.

02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:28,590
At least he got three pinged.

2184
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:29,670
He lives inside.

2185
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:32,710
He literally like is it's like in the office.

2186
02:26:33,690 --> 02:26:34,330
Yeah.

2187
02:26:35,570 --> 02:26:36,510
Are we going?

02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:37,950
Yeah, we're going to middle earth.

2189
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:42,830
Guys, we're going to the middle earth.

2190
02:26:44,010 --> 02:26:44,290
Hello?

2191
02:26:45,770 --> 02:26:46,170
Hello.

2192
02:26:47,450 --> 02:26:48,130
Hear me out.

2193
02:26:48,330 --> 02:26:49,970
How good is Waki Zio in Spider-Man?

2194
02:26:53,310 --> 02:26:54,830
How good is he on Spider-Man?

2195
02:26:55,390 --> 02:26:58,430
I just know it's all he plays, so I think we keep him on
Bucky.

2196
02:26:59,070 --> 02:27:00,430
Yeah, that is all he plays.

2197
02:27:00,610 --> 02:27:01,270
I'm not going to lie.

2198
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:01,810
Yeah.

2199
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:02,190
Yeah.

2200
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:02,330
Okay.

2201
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:04,730
I want to say something top.

2202
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:09,230
I was like, I mean, it's all he plays and he's also Celestio
3.

2203
02:27:09,810 --> 02:27:11,950
Is that something for me to say?

2204
02:27:13,230 --> 02:27:13,490
Yeah.

2205
02:27:15,330 --> 02:27:22,930
Okay, but also, guys, it is all he plays, but he is also in
Celestio 3 with his one trick.

2206
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:27,990
I don't have a good one.

2207
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:29,130
I'm not going to lie.

2208
02:27:29,410 --> 02:27:34,050
I do see him win off his one trick a lot more, but I don't
know.

2209
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:36,270
I said it.

2210
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:37,030
Get up to you guys.

2211
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:37,810
I don't mind.

2212
02:27:38,910 --> 02:27:39,510
Are we in Wakanda?

2213
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:41,210
I think we're in Wakanda.

2214
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:43,230
Yeah, especially on this map too.

2215
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:45,030
I think you keep him on it.

2216
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:46,970
He wants to.

2217
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:48,790
I don't know why they chose this map.

2218
02:27:48,950 --> 02:27:49,950
It's just so like pork heavy.

2219
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:51,650
Yeah, this is bad for them.

2220
02:27:51,790 --> 02:27:52,630
I don't know why they picked it.

2221
02:27:53,070 --> 02:27:54,490
Maybe they're swapping up their strategy.

2222
02:27:54,810 --> 02:27:56,150
Maybe Dweep is picking up roots.

2223
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:00,190
There you go.

2224
02:28:00,630 --> 02:28:01,650
He is good though.

2225
02:28:01,730 --> 02:28:02,970
He is good on his one trick.

2226
02:28:03,090 --> 02:28:04,690
But he is also in Celestio.

2227
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:15,410
right now it's just not spider-man meta right now the only
the issue is that it's not spider-man meta no fear that's

2228
02:28:15,410 --> 02:28:28,350
why he wants the eu so he's not climbing because of it i'm
gonna go on jordan maybe you see frankfurt again bro he gets

2229
02:28:28,350 --> 02:28:31,530
more ping why the fuck does the guy want frankfurt

2230

2231
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:58,230

2232
02:28:58,230 --> 02:29:05,010
just wants to make it harder he likes the challenge guys he
was like 200 ping was not big enough of a challenge

2233
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:17,570
he's trying to hit a high score oh the sound guys everything
balanced now for audio i prefer pepsi i can't lie i think

2234
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:28,430
pepsi clears really that's a hot take he needs the thrill of
a real like he wants to predict everything he's like he's

2235
02:29:28,430 --> 02:29:34,890
he's like this thing is too good make get worse the best
pepsi i had was in the philippines because they had a

2244
02:30:37,390 --> 02:30:38,210

2248
02:30:46,470 --> 02:30:47,070
Yeah, we're ready.

2249
02:30:47,170 --> 02:30:47,250

go i

2258
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:20,380
think i'm like more socially awkward for this team is
because i literally the the only two people i've talked to

2259
02:31:20,380 --> 02:31:27,720
really was rigsy i mean i've had teams i've been teamed with
gail a couple of times like maybe like one one other time

2260
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:36,280
but like everyone else is like super new you want to just
keep it on their level yeah yeah yeah so like this is a lot

2261
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:39,940
more socially awkward because it's It's like poor people who
I don't really know.

2262
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:42,500
And even then, I'd never really talked to Risky.

2263
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:46,340
We just interacted via text to each other.

2264
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:53,100
So, so I'm just like, for me, I'm like, I don't know what to
say.

2265
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:54,600
So we are giving them Spirements.

2266
02:31:54,700 --> 02:31:56,420
Who's going to be our second Ben, we think?

2267
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:01,460
We got to get rid of either Loki or Gambit.

2268
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:02,420
No.

2269
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:04,360
Whatever, when they don't save, yeah.

2270
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:07,900
Yeah, that's a little bit, okay.

2271
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:18,060
bring them down though yeah i brought them down i think uh
if we are playing star lord um i'd probably rather ban i

2272
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:28,660
brought him down loki keep the yeah gambit for the alt
combos okay yeah yeah loki ban is good if i can play celok

2273
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:38,780
yeah oh good point just vibe and flow yeah i think it's just
staying I like that.

2274
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:39,960
Fan Loki products lie.

2275
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:41,340
Bye.

2276
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:43,000
I was just too good.

2277
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:43,880
They were target bad in me, guys.

2278
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:44,980
This game should be like fucking easy.

2279
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:46,080
I was just so good.

2280
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:46,260
No.

2281
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:49,920
And they were afraid of me.

2282
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:51,220
Ew, this is disgusting.

2283
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:56,460
Oh, I like this.

2284
02:32:58,060 --> 02:32:59,220
It's gonna be nasty.

2285
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:03,860
So you're probably either on pocket or living here.

2286
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,220
It just depends on what they're playing.

2287
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:06,600
You feel like you can live.

2288
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:07,440
And you know.

2289
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:21,740

hey What the Oh, I was like, what the fuck?

2291
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:36,160
I look how they added him Just see like This one was coming

2294
02:33:54,800 --> 02:34:04,920

they might do ultron as well maybe yeah eventually there's

2295
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,000
double support ultron which is not as yeah but what What do
you want to play, Joki?

2297
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:13,880
Oh, we're still in ping.

2298

We're in a nice though.

2300
02:34:17,300 --> 02:34:17,480
Defense.

2302
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:19,680

I think I think I actually Phoenix here.

2310
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:31,540
Because it would be on a rocket.

2311
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:33,240
So I could put less effort.

2312
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:37,720
So I could try.

2313
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:50,420
gonna do is maybe rocket luna or or shark luna shark
honestly i would i would have played rockets so i could not

02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:41,620
I'm mucking this cup.

2344
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:42,780

2345
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:43,920

2354
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:51,620
Done.

2355
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:52,120

02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:53,600
Oh, and he hears.

2357
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:54,120
Spider-Man behind.

2358
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:54,800
On your backline.

2359
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:55,460
I can't grab one.

2360
02:35:55,640 --> 02:35:55,880
Oh, well.

2361
02:35:56,340 --> 02:35:56,760
I'm dead.

2362
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:02,240
I'm also might be dead.

2363
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:03,340
Caps one.

2364
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:03,760
Caps one.

2365
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:04,260
Caps one.

2366
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:05,080

Yeah.

2370
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:10,020
Yeah, I can go support.

2371
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:12,420
I'll be banned.

2372
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:13,620
Oh, maybe Rixie goes somewhere.

2373
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:16,420
Spider-Man might try and cancel me, so I'm going to put it
fast.

2374
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:17,680
I would go.

2375
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:21,660
I can touch three, two, one.

2376
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:23,640
I'm dead.

2377
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:24,600
Can we help her?

2378
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:25,320
Kappa, right?

2379
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:26,440
Kappa is half.

2380
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:27,160
Kappa is half.

2381
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:28,340

Kappa is done.

2385
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:32,780
Kappa can die.

2386
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:33,080
You can die.

2387
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:34,680
I have Spider-Man on me.

2388
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:35,600
I might be dead, though.

2389
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:37,860
Kappa's like, can I break the bunker?

2390
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:39,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

2391

2393
02:36:41,960 --> 02:36:42,600
I'm done.

2394
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:43,300
I'm done.

2395
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:43,880

Good job.

2474
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,580
I just steal the Adam look at it.

2475
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:09,440

Nice.

2478
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:13,260
Take damage for our Luna.

2479
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:16,540
What do they have?

2480
02:39:16,660 --> 02:39:17,560
They have Spider-Man alone, right?

2481
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:18,240
Yeah, they do.

2482
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:20,220
Yeah, Spider-Man, Broke, I think.

2483
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:21,180
Capped.

2484
02:39:21,400 --> 02:39:22,280
Yeah, maybe Capped.

2485

Yeah, I'm trying to take damage.

2487
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:26,620
They don't have a lot of poke, though.

2488
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:28,060
You want to go early with Sai?

2489
02:39:28,300 --> 02:39:29,700
I think we need a force before they get to point.

2490
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:32,100
Oh, yeah, I can do it.

2491
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:33,340

I'm on Roke.

2494
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:36,980
Roke can die, maybe.

2495
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:37,640
They still block.

2496
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:37,940
Yeah, yeah.

2497
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:38,660
One, two, one.

02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:40,080

2503
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:47,460

02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,540

02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:18,280
Yeah, we have to create.

2701
02:45:18,620 --> 02:45:19,660
They use both vaults though.

2702
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:20,140
They have both support.

2703
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:24,400
They have, uh, they have Spiderman.

2704
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:26,600
I have vault here.

2705
02:45:26,900 --> 02:45:27,780
I can look first.

2706
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:29,980
Spiderman is looking for a hook again.

2707
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:31,780
Yeah, I can just put a hook together.

2708
02:45:32,620 --> 02:45:33,140
They don't have support.

2709
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:33,820
We can just bungle in.

2710
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:35,780
Okay, okay.

2711
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:36,380
Me first.

2712
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:39,000
I'm gonna grab the Emma so she can't ult, okay?

2713
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:39,800
Oh, we gotta wait.

2714
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:43,240
Wait, they might push...

2715
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:44,300
They might push like early.

2716
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:46,300
I'm coming back on Venom, you see by first.

2717
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:47,260
Okay, okay.

2718
02:45:49,880 --> 02:45:50,720
Are we here?

2719
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,020
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

2720
02:45:53,140 --> 02:45:54,300
Can we walk?

2721
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:55,980
Oh, we're going, we're going.

2722
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:57,040
Three, two, one.

2723
02:45:57,140 --> 02:45:58,360
I got the Emma, I got the Emma, Emma, Emma.

2724
02:45:58,800 --> 02:45:59,540
I'm looking for Bongo.

2725
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:00,900
I'm on Bongo for him.

2726
02:46:01,880 --> 02:46:02,200
Nice!

2727
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:03,860
Oh, I have a Spider-Man on me.

2728
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:04,540
Emma has to hold.

2729
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:05,060
Look, Emma, look at him.

2730
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:06,040
Spider-Man low?

2731
02:46:06,480 --> 02:46:06,880
Spider-Man half?

2732
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:07,980
Iron Fist dies, Iron Fist.

2733
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:08,820
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

2734
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:09,260
He gets Mega.

2735
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:13,620
Listen, Spider-Man right side here.

2736
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:14,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2737
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:14,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2739
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:17,220
I'll see you.

2740
02:46:17,220 --> 02:46:17,860
I think he got out.

2741
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:19,400
Nice.

2742
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:21,220
They have Spider-Man all...

2743
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:24,660
We have Freeze, Bucky, Phoenix, so...

2744
02:46:24,660 --> 02:46:25,240
50 bills apart.

2745
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,040
Yeah, we have a little stuns for it.

2746
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:28,080
We have a little stuns for it.

2747
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:28,560
We're good.

2748
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:31,740
I have to play inside against this guy.

2749
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:33,120
That's okay.

2750
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:34,280
We can just play on point.

2751
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:34,840
Look at their comp.

2752
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:36,580
They have to like go into us.

2753
02:46:36,820 --> 02:46:37,100
We're fine.

2754
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:41,600
I'll just follow up with whatever Kepon does.

2755
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:42,460
There's Spider-Man's coming.

2756
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:43,860
He missed.

2757
02:46:43,980 --> 02:46:44,660
Watch pull up the map.

2758
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:45,200
Yeah, he's trying.

2759
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:45,780
I'm walking under Emma.

2760
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:46,340
Backline.

2761
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:47,460
3, 2, 1.

2762
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:48,120
I'm on backline.

2763
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:48,320

02:46:48,340 --> 02:46:48,440

2765
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:50,660
I'm on backline.

2766
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:51,000
Nice.

2767
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:52,280
Getting rogue here?

2768
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:53,300
Oh, grab.

2769
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:54,080

2770
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:54,560
I'm on backline.

2771
02:46:55,140 --> 02:46:55,860
I'm on backline.

2772
02:46:56,180 --> 02:46:56,500
I'm on backline.

02:46:58,940 --> 02:47:00,440
Oh my god, nuclear.

2774
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:02,240
Nuclear.

2775
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:03,420
They have both support.

2776
02:47:03,820 --> 02:47:04,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2777
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:05,680
We should go really early with Rogue.

2778
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:06,640
Yeah, yeah, I can.

2779
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:08,300
Yeah, yeah.

2780
02:47:08,380 --> 02:47:08,920
Only way we went.

2781
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:11,020
Like 70 to old.

2782
02:47:11,100 --> 02:47:13,120
I can build for the die.

2783
02:47:13,320 --> 02:47:13,940
I'm hiding and looking.

2784
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:14,340
Alright.

2785
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:15,480
I'm going on Luna and Rocket.

2786
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:17,680
Three, two, one.

2787
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:18,660
I have a Spider-Man on you.

2788
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:19,880
I need help.

2789
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:20,240
I need help.

2790
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:20,600
I need help.

2791
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:21,820
I need help.

2792
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:23,840
I need a lot of help.

2793
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:26,900
Oh, I need a lot of help too.

2794
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:28,500
Yeah.

2795
02:47:28,940 --> 02:47:29,620
They ulted though.

2796
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:29,980
Just give it.

2797
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:30,620
Just give it.

2798
02:47:30,820 --> 02:47:31,060
It's all good.

2799
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:32,180
I mean, we got... No, I'm friends.

2800
02:47:33,820 --> 02:47:34,360
Is that it?

2801
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:35,160
Yeah, we did.

2802
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:37,220
Yeah.

2803
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:37,720
They don't know.

2804
02:47:38,340 --> 02:47:39,280
They have Bucky...

2805
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:40,340
Bucky Rogue Luna.

2806
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:42,100
They use Spider?

2807
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:43,560
Or do they have...

2808
02:47:43,560 --> 02:47:44,140
They have it.

2809
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:44,980
They used it.

2810
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:45,820
They used it last fight.

2811
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:46,800
Oh, there you go.

2812
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:47,500
Yeah, there you go.

2813
02:47:49,280 --> 02:47:49,900
We're just gonna bait Luna.

2814
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:51,520
Let's take a quick fight and bait Luna.

2815
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,880
Then we can live and then we can go with our Bucky and
Phoenix combo.

2816
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:54,200
Yeah.

2817
02:47:54,420 --> 02:47:55,840
Don't be afraid to die, by the way, Doki.

2818
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:57,340
I have Bongo for you.

2819
02:47:57,580 --> 02:47:58,120
Most fight.

2820
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:58,680
Or not Bongo.

2821
02:47:58,900 --> 02:47:59,240
Sorry, guys.

2822
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:00,040
We're still down on...

2823
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:01,500
He's dealing with Spider behind us, guys.

2824
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:02,200
Yeah, yeah.

2825
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:02,780
I lived.

2826
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:04,900
Okay, we can walk.

2827
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:05,880
I'm gonna go on the Emma ready.

2828
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:07,060
Three, two, one.

2829
02:48:07,240 --> 02:48:07,640
I have Diamond.

2830
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:08,340
Oh, I spotted one.

2831
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:11,180

2834
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:14,600
I'm pulling in.

2835
02:48:14,680 --> 02:48:14,840
No Diamond.

2836
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,260
I'm a Luna.

2837
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:17,860
Usually every two is killing me.

2838
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:18,280

02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:20,160
I have a rogue.

2841
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:23,740
We did have a rogue behind us.

2842
02:48:24,320 --> 02:48:24,760
A first Luna.

2843
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:25,860
They busted.

2844
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:27,640
They... Rookin dead.

2845
02:48:27,640 --> 02:48:27,920

2846
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:28,300

2849
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:29,960
Rookin, whoa.

02:48:34,020 --> 02:48:34,820
Rock has us.

2854
02:48:37,940 --> 02:48:37,960
Nice.

2855
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:39,200
There's five points.

2856
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:40,180
Kill points.

2857
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:41,040
Yeah, I'm on one.

2858
02:48:41,400 --> 02:48:41,720
I'm on.

2859
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:43,020
Back one, back one.

2860
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:45,220
Spider, spider.

2861
02:48:45,940 --> 02:48:47,100
He has spider over touch.

2862
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:47,640
They're TPing.

2863
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:48,300
They're TPing.

2864
02:48:48,420 --> 02:48:48,760
They're TPing.

2865
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:50,260
Play left side with me, Doki.

2866
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:51,060
Inside.

2867
02:48:52,040 --> 02:48:52,660
I'll go to the right side.

2868
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:56,140
They have Spider-Man a lot.

2869
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:56,320
Okay.

2870
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:57,380
I got the ammo.

2871
02:48:58,200 --> 02:48:58,980
He's gonna go on us.

2872
02:48:59,480 --> 02:49:00,160
I'm playing a corner.

2873
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:00,480
Head one.

2874
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:02,000
Head one.

2875
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:03,160
Oh, fuck it.

2876
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:04,260
One, change the one.

2877
02:49:04,900 --> 02:49:05,120
Where?

2878
02:49:05,420 --> 02:49:07,140
Oh, I'm dead here.

2879
02:49:07,320 --> 02:49:07,660
Are you killed two?

2880
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:08,140
I killed two?

2881
02:49:10,480 --> 02:49:11,820
He's just a little to me.

2882
02:49:13,160 --> 02:49:13,360
Yeah.

2883
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:13,820
I'm on one, I'm on one.

2884
02:49:13,820 --> 02:49:14,760

Spider-Man, Captain America, fucking beating my ass off.

2918
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:40,220
I had no health insurance.

2919
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:45,440
There was no health insurance in this.

2920
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:49,660
Yeah.

2921
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:53,180
The two solo alts, too.

2922
02:50:54,560 --> 02:50:57,620
I got all the solo alts in so many times.

2923
02:50:58,480 --> 02:50:59,460
I was not happy.

2924
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:09,880
a good time that's i was like i don't really want to play
luna i i guess i don't know i don't know how the scheduling

2925
02:51:09,880 --> 02:51:18,840
works did we even get broadcasted or not no uh yeah we
didn't get broadcasted um we didn't get what was the point

2926
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:30,480
if we weren't broadcasted oh my god okay the winner of ours
starts at 5 p.m oh yeah it's the holy two hours Okay, what

2927
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:34,020
is the point of making us wait if we're not broadcasted?

2928
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:35,520
That's what I'm saying.

2929
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:36,500
Yeah, I agree with you on that one.

2930
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:38,200
Just fucking run it.

Yeah.

2932
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:44,420

The beat is good.

2981
02:59:29,130 --> 02:59:30,270
It's just lyrics-wise.

2982
02:59:30,470 --> 02:59:31,330
It's very unfortunate.

2983
02:59:32,090 --> 02:59:32,910
Big guy.

Fuck you, me.

2988
02:59:51,610 --> 02:59:53,570

2997
03:01:26,530 --> 03:01:27,290
game.

2998
03:01:27,490 --> 03:01:30,950
One game and one Hades run.

2999
03:01:32,410 --> 03:01:34,110
Attack and do it another run.

3000
03:01:34,250 --> 03:01:36,130
We're gonna miss out on content.

3001
03:01:39,150 --> 03:01:42,350
Yes, I started at 9 in the morning.

3002
03:01:42,630 --> 03:01:46,890
It's now 12.15 and I played one game.

3003
03:02:00,470 --> 03:02:01,190
I don't

3004
03:02:04,240 --> 03:02:05,300
I don't

3005
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,420
there's no way.

3006
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:12,860
No, I No, I was like, what?

3007
03:02:13,300 --> 03:02:14,780
What do you mean?

3008
03:02:15,540 --> 03:02:17,180
I have to wait.

3009
03:02:17,720 --> 03:02:18,440
There's no way.

3010
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:22,340
I refuse to believe that that is the schedule.

3011
03:02:22,860 --> 03:02:25,440
I refuse to believe that.

3012
03:02:27,440 --> 03:02:29,400
Because the thing is, look, I am...

3013
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:32,560
I've seen a lot of graphics, so I don't know which ones...

3014
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:35,240
This is supposed to be the schedule.

3015
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:42,160
I know damn well we did not start at, like...

3016
03:02:43,160 --> 03:02:44,100
What's the tab?

3017
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:49,680
Our match number one did not start at 10 a.m.

3018
03:02:54,330 --> 03:02:55,550
Oh, why is it an EST?

3019
03:02:55,790 --> 03:02:57,290
I don't know how to read EST.

3020
03:02:58,390 --> 03:02:59,670
I'm from a PSD.

3021
03:03:03,970 --> 03:03:05,070
I don't know.

3022
03:03:05,470 --> 03:03:10,690
I don't know if I like Venom groaning and all that shit in
my ear.

3023
03:03:13,310 --> 03:03:15,410
There's supposed to be the actuals.

3024
03:03:15,430 --> 03:03:27,050
schedule it's like plus or minus three out like no I know
it's minus three hours but counting backwards sucks I don't

3025
03:03:27,050 --> 03:03:34,270
know it's not guys I might be stupid but I know I know I
have to convert PSD to ESD I'm just saying it sucks that I

3026
03:03:34,270 --> 03:03:36,410
always have to subtract it every time

3027
03:03:41,390 --> 03:03:50,230
this does not look correct you're an hour behind and and I
still have I've not had my second match yet.

3028
03:03:51,570 --> 03:03:52,850
It's just inconvenient.

3029
03:03:53,750 --> 03:03:57,050
I would play a game, but I'm eating chicken nuggets right
now.

3030
03:03:57,330 --> 03:04:01,150
I don't know if I can play a rival's match, because I don't
know when my match is supposed to start.

3031
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:12,520
Bump, bump, bump, bump.

3032
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:14,360
Yeah, my chicken nuggets.

3033
03:04:22,820 --> 03:04:24,340
That's nuggy sauce.

3034
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:25,060
I don't know.

3035
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:28,100
I haven't had chicken nuggets in so long, so I can't tell.

3036
03:04:31,540 --> 03:04:32,940
No, I'm fucking leaving.

3037
03:04:33,460 --> 03:04:35,840
I said I'm leaving at 4.30 back.

3038
03:04:40,730 --> 03:04:44,130
Like, I was like, I didn't...

3039
03:04:44,130 --> 03:04:45,150
I can't commit.

3040
03:04:47,130 --> 03:04:48,310
You told me...

3041
03:04:48,310 --> 03:04:54,170
I asked them, and they told me that, don't worry, it would
end way before my 4 p.m.

3042
03:04:54,170 --> 03:04:55,130
I said 4 p.m.

3043
03:04:55,130 --> 03:04:59,090
I'm being generous right now by pushing it to 4.30.

3044
03:05:00,250 --> 03:05:03,370
But I was like, they were like, don't worry, it'll end way
before 4.

3045
03:05:03,670 --> 03:05:08,730
And I was like, yeah, okay, if you promise me that, I'll
sign, I'll participate.

3046
03:05:14,610 --> 03:05:16,710
I said, it's not flexible.

3047
03:05:18,890 --> 03:05:24,690
I said PSD, I was like, if it was ESD, there is no way they
can commit to ESD.

3048
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:29,910
Literally, I think they have an hour left if it was ESD,
that's worse.

3049
03:05:30,350 --> 03:05:32,490
If I said I have to leave at 4 p.m.

3050
03:05:32,710 --> 03:05:36,290
EST, That is a lot worse than PSD

3051
03:05:39,370 --> 03:05:51,190
Because I'm out by in an hour Yeah No, they'll find me a sub
I said I really can't do it Like I legitimately cannot push

3052
03:05:51,190 --> 03:05:56,630
this Like I have a contract obligation I didn't sign no
contract for this tournament Like

3053
03:06:01,190 --> 03:06:03,810
I didn't sign a contract track here.

3054
03:06:04,150 --> 03:06:07,030
I signed a contract for the maid cafe, though.

3055
03:06:14,410 --> 03:06:15,650
That's crazy.

3056
03:06:16,030 --> 03:06:18,430
We're already almost on match three.

3057
03:06:19,790 --> 03:06:20,170
Alternate.

3058
03:06:20,650 --> 03:06:24,950
The alternate universe, Joki, might be on match three by
now.

3059
03:06:25,090 --> 03:06:26,850
I'm on the other side of the coin.

3060
03:06:27,790 --> 03:06:29,030
Patrick, I said, leave a super chat.

3061
03:06:29,090 --> 03:06:29,770
Thank you.

3062
03:06:29,870 --> 03:06:30,890
Me, when I lie.

3063
03:06:31,050 --> 03:06:33,190
VTuber, I'll support a choir.

3064
03:06:36,750 --> 03:06:39,050
Yeah, I am...

3065
03:06:40,010 --> 03:06:40,950
I'm just muted.

3066
03:06:41,130 --> 03:06:41,810
Nobody's talking.

3067
03:06:41,910 --> 03:06:43,230
They're all talking to their chat.

3068
03:06:45,150 --> 03:06:48,130
But everybody's just talking to their own chat.

3069
03:06:53,490 --> 03:06:56,810
I don't know.

3070
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:02,800
I'm just awkward right now.

3071
03:07:03,020 --> 03:07:06,400
And it's because I had a lot of social interaction.

3072
03:07:07,540 --> 03:07:07,840
Oh, yeah.

3073
03:07:08,060 --> 03:07:09,120
The last couple of days.

3074
03:07:09,380 --> 03:07:10,620
So that's why I'm like super awkward.

3075
03:07:11,480 --> 03:07:12,220
Talking to people.

3076
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:13,760
Takes more effort for me.

3077
03:07:22,960 --> 03:07:25,840
Bump, bump, bump, bump.

3078
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:27,340
Bump,

3079
03:07:38,850 --> 03:07:41,370
bump, bump, bump, bump.

3080
03:07:41,990 --> 03:07:48,350
I don't know which team is, like, the strongest team right
now.

3081
03:07:49,750 --> 03:07:55,970
I feel like some teams deserve to have three pros.

3082
03:07:59,190 --> 03:08:00,470
The battery's not working right now.

3083
03:08:00,570 --> 03:08:02,670
I mean, I had a lot of interactions yesterday.

3084
03:08:03,330 --> 03:08:07,990
I think, like, you know, 30-plus people were there at the
mid-cap phase.

3085
03:08:11,130 --> 03:08:17,050
And, you know, I talked to a lot of people
back-to-back-to-back.

3086
03:08:17,410 --> 03:08:20,670
And also, like, that was what it meant, too.

3087
03:08:24,620 --> 03:08:25,960
Yeah, but it's hard to gauge.

3088
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:28,800
Because, okay, look, it's very hard to gauge.

3089
03:08:28,900 --> 03:08:29,600
I'll tell you why.

3090
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:42,960
some teams have two pro players who are tank and DPS or even
deep to double DPS so it's very hard to gauge whether or not

3091
03:08:42,960 --> 03:08:47,520
but like what team would is like a very strong team

3092
03:08:51,000 --> 03:09:09,020
there's like um okay zeal's team he had a tank and a support
but his tank is also on 200 ping so like like you know not

3093
03:09:09,020 --> 03:09:17,460
the greatest um the other pro is spark cheap he's the off
tank player from fly quest

3094
03:09:21,840 --> 03:09:40,460
mmhmm so like I don't know yellow isn't considered pro he's
a content creator technically a content creator but it must

3095
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:45,580
be nice to be on hush of like I want to stream on YouTube
because I wanted to keep the VOD because I always forget to

3096
03:09:45,580 --> 03:09:53,900
upload VODs like I don't know I'm sorry guys I will remember
one day I'm gonna hand the VOD channel over to my staff team

3097
03:09:53,900 --> 03:10:01,520
and then they can handle the VOD channel but like I'm just
all over the place right now so I just wanted to keep the

3098
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:03,460
VODs so that's why I streamed here

3099
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:09,800
I like having tournament stuff on the main channel

3100
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:21,680
No, I don't.

3101
03:10:21,920 --> 03:10:23,480
No, I don't.

3102
03:10:27,020 --> 03:10:28,980
Nidoki's vlog channels are still exciting.

3103
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:29,900
Oh, yeah.

3104
03:10:30,740 --> 03:10:31,060
Um.

3105
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:36,240
I made a tweet.

3106
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:38,540
Because apparently, okay, it was rumors.

3107
03:10:38,620 --> 03:10:41,300
Because the director came in and was like, oh, yeah, they
deleted it.

3108
03:10:41,560 --> 03:10:42,920
Ha, ha, they deleted a tweet.

3109
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:47,760
So, um, I can't believe the guy deleted his tweet.

3110
03:10:47,840 --> 03:10:54,880
So the guy, some guy made a tweet being like, um, rumors
saying that it'll take the new star wars game the star wars

3111
03:10:54,880 --> 03:11:01,760
old republic like 2030 earliest release date and direct and
i over tweeted it i was like this is our new silk song you

3112
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:06,900
know every year we'll be like is silk song gonna be
announced yet i was gonna be like this is our new silk song

3113
03:11:06,900 --> 03:11:13,520
he's like that's what we need we need a new silk song um
you'd be like yeah gta is our silk song like it's not the

3114
03:11:13,520 --> 03:11:26,120
same it's not the same because we all know gta would take
fucking forever and still only have six games like like

3115
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:40,580
everyone everyone everyone expects expects it already like
no one no one is like oh ha ha when will they announce GTA

3116
03:11:40,580 --> 03:11:51,600
but everyone is just like it's just expected but um yeah GTA
6 has another one in the most anticipated a game they just

3117
03:11:51,600 --> 03:12:02,380
want to collect that collect the free free award it's like
their collect go yeah so we need another silk song to keep

3118
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:09,300
it hype you know but that's why there is nothing to look
forward to in the game awards like some people like what

3119
03:12:09,300 --> 03:12:14,940
about blood boy oh guys come on i'm once i want something
realistic here

3120
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:22,500
guys we're talking about something realistic like

3121
03:12:28,880 --> 03:12:34,280
so so I was like we need it and then like I was like yay
that's right because they're like oh and then the director

3122
03:12:34,280 --> 03:12:43,220
the Mass Effect director guy was like guys don't worry um it
will not release before it will not release um after 2030

3123
03:12:43,220 --> 03:12:47,800
guys don't worry and then I was like that's what they all
said about Silk Song, too.

3124
03:12:48,100 --> 03:12:53,460
They're like, I was like, you can't promise us that.

3125
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:55,700
You just started development.

3126
03:12:56,180 --> 03:12:59,080
They said that about Silk Song as well.

3127
03:12:59,660 --> 03:13:02,240
Like, quote, retweet me when they delay it again.

3128
03:13:05,560 --> 03:13:14,000
If they actually delay Star Wars, the old Republic quote
retweet me and be like, she knew something.

3129
03:13:14,340 --> 03:13:14,540
Like,

3130
03:13:25,190 --> 03:13:31,430
Yeah, I was like, there's no way you can promise us that.

3131
03:13:31,830 --> 03:13:38,350
There's no way you can just start development and then
promise us that it will release, like, before something.

3132
03:13:38,590 --> 03:13:39,730
Like, there's no fucking way.

3133
03:13:39,750 --> 03:13:42,210
There's no way you would have the schedule down by now.

3134
03:13:43,790 --> 03:13:45,510
You just started development.

3135
03:13:46,050 --> 03:13:46,270
Yeah.

3136
03:13:48,610 --> 03:13:49,890
It's so unrealistic.

3137
03:13:52,450 --> 03:13:54,790
Especially when you want a good game.

3138
03:13:55,270 --> 03:13:58,510
That's why I'm like, I'm like, you know.

3139
03:14:01,350 --> 03:14:03,370
That's why I'm like, what's the word?

3140
03:14:04,970 --> 03:14:05,470
Doubting?

3141
03:14:05,710 --> 03:14:06,810
Like, what's the other word for doubting?

3142
03:14:08,810 --> 03:14:09,370
Um.

3143
03:14:12,030 --> 03:14:12,850
What's the word?

3144
03:14:12,890 --> 03:14:13,430
Skeptical.

3145
03:14:13,710 --> 03:14:15,330
I'm like skeptical about it.

3146
03:14:16,090 --> 03:14:19,990
No, I'm skeptical because there's no way you can figure out
the schedule.

3147
03:14:20,950 --> 03:14:23,290
When you just started development this year.

3148
03:14:23,350 --> 03:14:26,570
Like, how long did they take you to develop Mass Effect?

3149
03:14:27,350 --> 03:14:28,410
Okay, how long?

3150
03:14:30,870 --> 03:14:31,650
How long?

3151
03:14:31,850 --> 03:14:33,270
Especially with Disney!

3152
03:14:34,650 --> 03:14:38,510
How long did Mass Effect go in the...

3153
03:14:40,490 --> 03:14:41,770
Go in...

3154
03:14:42,670 --> 03:14:45,430
Yeah, I'm like, bro, you're working with a Disney IP.

3155
03:14:47,370 --> 03:14:50,070
That shit is not gonna fucking...

3156
03:14:52,870 --> 03:15:02,770
took about three and okay mass effect one took about three
and a half years to develop i mean i guess 2020 mass effect

3157
03:15:02,770 --> 03:15:14,970
one though mass effect one took three years i feel like it
doesn't have as much okay mass effect okay that's building

3158
03:15:14,970 --> 03:15:16,010
off the foundation

3159
03:15:20,230 --> 03:15:24,470
It was a BioWare Magic thing.

3160
03:15:24,550 --> 03:15:25,850
I would say 4 to 5.

3161
03:15:26,090 --> 03:15:27,470
I definitely think 4 to 5.

3162
03:15:28,470 --> 03:15:30,490
Especially Whatever the scope they are.

3163
03:15:32,450 --> 03:15:32,610
Yeah.

3164
03:15:37,910 --> 03:15:38,190
Alright.

3165
03:15:38,610 --> 03:15:38,610
Here.

3166
03:15:38,710 --> 03:15:39,490
Here's something else.

3167
03:15:40,870 --> 03:15:44,230
How long has Wolverine been in development?

3168
03:15:47,580 --> 03:15:49,600
I think that's a better gauge.

3169
03:15:51,380 --> 03:15:52,800
When did they start developing it?

3170
03:15:55,340 --> 03:16:05,380
all right my that's a better fit marvel's wolverine game has
been in development since 2020 it's almost 2026

3171
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:18,520
now it's a baby in development since 2020 and it's and we
just got the gameplay trailer

3172
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:36,840
like 21 that's like two years ago dude oh my poor sweet
summer child i think covid took a lot more than your taste

It just does not work.

I don't know what's going on there.

3181
03:17:25,660 --> 03:17:26,740
It knows you're European.

3182

03:17:28,820 --> 03:17:29,780

Wait, it's okay.

3185
03:17:34,540 --> 03:17:35,820
We're mocking them on YouTube.

3186
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:38,180
It's okay, since I'm the only one on YouTube.

3187

Hell yeah.

Every friend is in, but I'm not going to let me in.

03:19:27,290 --> 03:19:28,750

3219
03:19:53,680 --> 03:19:54,400

03:19:57,780 --> 03:19:59,660

3227
03:20:20,510 --> 03:20:22,850
Yeah, it does have a lot of animations and parodies.

3228
03:20:23,010 --> 03:20:23,850

Oh, there is definitely gay.

3264
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:14,640
Does anyone remember that rabbit comic back, like the web
comic days, where it's like these rabbit killers?

3265
03:23:15,940 --> 03:23:18,960
I don't remember it because they did an Anna, what's called?

3266
03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:21,880
with the internet is for poor aim.

3267
03:23:22,240 --> 03:23:23,140
Does anyone remember that?

3268
03:23:23,780 --> 03:23:26,800
I don't remember the comic series, the web comic series.

3269
03:23:27,400 --> 03:23:29,500
I don't know everyone was obsessed with it back in the day.

3270
03:23:31,260 --> 03:23:35,500
They're like little, they are, they're shaped like little
rabbits, but they're like killer rabbits.

3271
03:23:35,720 --> 03:23:37,460
And one was like, one was blue.

3272
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:39,660
One was a blue rabbit.

3273
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:41,940
That's all I could remember about it.

3274
03:23:45,330 --> 03:23:48,530
That was, that's like around the time with the Team Fortress
2.

3275
03:23:49,370 --> 03:23:51,030
Is he gay or European?

3276
03:23:51,130 --> 03:23:54,410
I wish I could remember, like, what that series was called.

3277
03:23:55,870 --> 03:23:56,350
Let's see.

3278
03:23:57,490 --> 03:24:00,350
I know where to find it, because it was on DeviantArt.

3279
03:24:01,990 --> 03:24:02,470
Let's see.

3280
03:24:03,910 --> 03:24:04,790
The Entrant...

3281
03:24:04,790 --> 03:24:07,150
God, DeviantArt is just all AI now.

3282
03:24:08,070 --> 03:24:09,690
It's really all AI.

3283
03:24:14,270 --> 03:24:15,070
I guess I can't...

3284
03:24:15,070 --> 03:24:16,030
Oh, my gosh.

3285
03:24:17,270 --> 03:24:18,410
Don't have it anymore.

3286
03:24:18,430 --> 03:24:20,130
I wish I could remember what it was called.

3287
03:24:20,170 --> 03:24:21,850
No, it was, like, this indie shit.

3288
03:24:22,230 --> 03:24:23,150
It was, like, this...

3289
03:24:23,170 --> 03:24:31,610
artists that made like this web comic series about these
little rabbit like characters and they were like like killer

3290
03:24:31,610 --> 03:24:37,610
rabbits I guess I thought I could vaguely remember and I
remember one was like a blue rat one was a blue rabbit with

3291
03:24:37,610 --> 03:24:51,470
like metal hands and uh and um and uh it was like and they
did they did an animatic of the internet for porn and that's

3292
03:24:51,470 --> 03:24:58,810
how I could that's the only thing I era i've never i watched
happy tree friends once because it was like it's at like

3293
03:24:58,810 --> 03:25:05,630
school and then the the boys like pulled it up on the the
school pc's like let's watch happy tree friends now so

3294
03:25:07,150 --> 03:25:17,410
confused was it perky rabbit no it was definitely not perky
rabbits killer rabbits i don't even know if they're called

3295
03:25:17,410 --> 03:25:21,290
killer rabbits i'm pretty sure it was like some fucking
original species like

3296
03:25:27,800 --> 03:25:30,180
I was forced, yeah, I was forced to see it.

3297
03:25:30,280 --> 03:25:32,580
And yeah, I think it, I think they had a Newgrounds thing.

3298
03:25:32,760 --> 03:25:33,740
I won't be surprised.

3299
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:35,700
No, it was like some indie shit.

3300
03:25:36,540 --> 03:25:38,660
This wasn't like an actual mainstream.

3301
03:25:40,800 --> 03:25:44,560
It feels like, it feels like something on Newgrounds.

3302
03:25:45,140 --> 03:25:48,660
I don't know, I remember seeing it on Thieve in there, not
Newgrounds, though.

3303
03:25:51,920 --> 03:25:53,420
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

3304
03:25:57,040 --> 03:26:00,540
But, like, I don't think their names are rabbit-related.

3305
03:26:00,680 --> 03:26:03,780
I just remember them being, like, rabbit-shaped.

3306
03:26:05,340 --> 03:26:06,380
That's all I could remember.

3307
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:09,120
I don't know.

3308
03:26:09,360 --> 03:26:11,100
Maybe they deleted everything.

3309
03:26:12,880 --> 03:26:14,780
I'm pretty sure they must have deleted everything.

3310
03:26:15,680 --> 03:26:18,040
I don't think it's raging rabbits.

3311
03:26:18,280 --> 03:26:19,940
It does not sound familiar.

3312
03:26:23,620 --> 03:26:25,640
Curly, welcome to a tomato farm.

3313
03:26:25,780 --> 03:26:26,520
Welcome, welcome.

3314
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:30,980
Yeah, I remember this song.

3315
03:26:31,080 --> 03:26:32,600
I think it's very iconic.

3316
03:26:34,240 --> 03:26:36,300
Do you know they added 6-7 in Fortnite?

3317
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:38,780
By the way, I have a Fortnite code.

3318
03:26:40,480 --> 03:26:42,560
I should put a Fortnite and buy it.

3319
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:44,540
Whoa, okay, what if I...

3320
03:26:44,540 --> 03:26:45,380
You know, fuck it.

3321
03:26:48,560 --> 03:26:50,500
I'm waiting anyway.

3322
03:26:51,640 --> 03:26:53,520
Like, I'm fucking waiting.

3323
03:26:53,900 --> 03:26:54,280
I...

3324
03:26:54,280 --> 03:26:55,160
Oh, my God.

3325
03:26:55,240 --> 03:26:57,020
I swear if I could only play two games.

3326
03:26:57,040 --> 03:27:06,220
I swear to God I Let me Who mentioned it?

3327
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:07,640

Alright Let's boot up Fortnite guys Okay, how long?

3329

3330
03:27:23,320 --> 03:27:28,360

3331
03:27:28,740 --> 03:27:29,220
Oh, God.

3332
03:27:29,360 --> 03:27:29,940
It's like three.

3333
03:27:30,020 --> 03:27:30,460
Oh, my God.

3334
03:27:30,600 --> 03:27:31,540
It's not up there for a day.

3335
03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:32,800
Oh, yes.

3336
03:27:32,880 --> 03:27:33,860

3337
03:27:34,220 --> 03:27:35,920

Wait, I can.

3340
03:27:38,100 --> 03:27:40,280
Is it fucked up if I boot up Overwatch?

3341
03:27:40,460 --> 03:27:49,880
I am not sponsored, but I feel like it is like a bit frowned
upon if I boot up Overwatch in the Marvel Rivals tournament.

3342
03:27:50,480 --> 03:27:53,680
I might not be like idea.

3343
03:27:54,280 --> 03:27:55,940
I don't think they would like that.

3344
03:27:57,580 --> 03:28:01,040
Do not, do not boot it up.

3345
03:28:04,680 --> 03:28:09,780

like why why are we waiting two hours wait we're not

they've been in the meeting they know what the fuck is also

3388
03:35:17,510 --> 03:35:22,190

well, it seems like we're waiting another two hours.

3389
03:35:22,770 --> 03:35:26,150
And I'm like, what do you mean we're waiting another two
hours?

3390
03:35:29,150 --> 03:35:35,950
No, I know at least two people were in that meeting because
I looked in the VC during that time.

3391
03:35:37,850 --> 03:35:41,190
I looked at the VC and I saw two people were there.

3392
03:35:42,110 --> 03:35:43,910
At least two people were there.

3393
03:35:48,050 --> 03:35:59,930
Wait, other people are playing their game now why aren't we
playing our game what did we play our game i just saw i just

waited 20 minutes into a new lobby.

3396
03:36:20,910 --> 03:36:23,770

03:36:36,110 --> 03:36:36,810
Excuse me.

3402
03:36:36,950 --> 03:36:38,330
This is discrimination.

All right.

3404
03:36:43,550 --> 03:36:46,610
All right.

3405
03:36:46,890 --> 03:36:46,890
All right.

3406
03:36:46,910 --> 03:36:47,890
Let's give me a sec.

3407
03:36:47,990 --> 03:36:57,550
Let me go through real quick all right is she okay i'm just
saying how come they get to wait 20 minutes and i had to

fucking boy i've been waiting i've had one game guys we've

been live for almost four hours and i played one game and

3410
03:37:20,050 --> 03:37:34,370

right now like if i'm frozen oh my god cronos has frozen me

3411
03:37:34,370 --> 03:37:44,570

3412

3413
03:38:00,110 --> 03:38:17,410

hours like you don't understand i waited three hours normal

3414
03:38:17,410 --> 03:38:21,310
it's not even just a three and a half hours yes

3415
03:38:24,570 --> 03:38:33,490
and i haven't oh my god i'm like downward spiraling and i
have a double block later

3416
03:38:36,890 --> 03:38:46,890
i don't know we got they're not even we better be on the
broadcast i swear to god we better be broadcast after that I

3417
03:38:46,890 --> 03:38:48,290
swear to thank you, God.

3418
03:38:53,050 --> 03:38:54,990
The fact, I think, like, it was fine.

3419
03:38:55,110 --> 03:38:55,950
I was like, oh, it's fine.

3420
03:38:56,050 --> 03:38:57,630
They're just broadcasting every game.

3421
03:38:57,990 --> 03:39:01,270
And I find out my game wasn't even broadcasted.

3422
03:39:01,750 --> 03:39:05,530
I think that was the worst part when I found that out.

3423
03:39:07,050 --> 03:39:08,350
I was like, what do you mean?

3424
03:39:09,830 --> 03:39:16,610
You mean I waited an hour and a half just to find out I
wasn't even on the channel?

3425
03:39:16,950 --> 03:39:17,230
Like,

3426
03:39:20,490 --> 03:39:24,930
it's not like we're waiting for the other team or nothing we
were both waiting

3427
03:39:31,340 --> 03:39:39,500
you're on the broadcast on round if we can make it we're
still dark i'm i really hate to break it to you but we are

3428
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:45,280
still on round one we're we're heading to round two like

3429
03:39:48,400 --> 03:39:56,540
like unless unless you mean that unless you mean game is
categorized as round four i hope that's what you mean

3430
03:39:56,540 --> 03:40:03,100
because because my we are still technically this is our that
would be our second game

3431
03:40:06,940 --> 03:40:28,350
no oh my god it's okay everything will be okay all right
guys we We almost got Fortnite.

3432
03:40:30,470 --> 03:40:32,650
Oh, we almost got the Fortnite out.

3433
03:40:35,170 --> 03:40:36,110
It's okay, guys.

3434
03:40:36,690 --> 03:40:38,810
Fortnite's about to start.

3435
03:40:39,510 --> 03:40:40,330
About to start.

3436
03:40:42,150 --> 03:40:43,510
I read the rules.

3437
03:40:43,650 --> 03:40:45,710
I don't know if my Fortnite audio would be fine, though.

3438
03:40:46,710 --> 03:40:47,270
We'll see.

3439
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:54,660
We'll see now if Fortnite will be fine.

3440
03:41:04,570 --> 03:41:06,210
Save us Fortnite.

3441
03:41:10,590 --> 03:41:12,930
Don't worry, Fortnite is booting up, guys.

3442
03:41:14,130 --> 03:41:15,950
We're jumping in Fortnite.

3443
03:41:18,070 --> 03:41:19,390
I can't, because I'm worried.

3444
03:41:19,510 --> 03:41:23,330
I boot up a game in Rivals, and then they're like, where are
you?

3445
03:41:23,350 --> 03:41:24,630
And I'm coming for the rig game.

3446
03:41:25,010 --> 03:41:31,350
I don't want to be like, because if I leave, I get the
penalty, and I can't get into a fucking custom match.

3447
03:41:32,290 --> 03:41:36,170
So it's easier for me to just play Fortnite, or play other
games.

3448

my game is i literally don't know when my game starts we are

Oh my god, I can't have Saitama.

3498
03:46:31,780 --> 03:46:34,140
Oh, I don't like that he's a hologram, though.

3499
03:46:34,800 --> 03:46:36,920
I guess because they're like, oh, he's not the real Saitama.

3500
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:39,280
Because then he would have killed everybody.

3501
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:41,780
Okay.

3502
03:46:45,350 --> 03:46:46,350
Oh, there's Scooby-Doo.

03:46:48,430 --> 03:46:52,330
I think it's weird that Scooby-Doo is like, I don't know.

3504
03:46:52,950 --> 03:46:54,370
He's just a man.

Now the goal is to have to kill one person so I can do this
on them.

03:49:44,490 --> 03:49:47,550
Wait, what would be the worst one?

What would be the worst one to use?

3548
03:49:51,170 --> 03:49:52,730
I hated Goku.

3549
03:49:53,070 --> 03:49:57,210
You think Goku would be the worst one to get 6-7 on?

3550
03:49:58,830 --> 03:49:59,550
Or Ninja.

3551
03:49:59,810 --> 03:50:00,750
It could be Ninja.

3552
03:50:01,070 --> 03:50:02,050
I think it's...

3553
03:50:03,750 --> 03:50:06,330
It's either Ninja or Mr. Beast.

3554
03:50:06,450 --> 03:50:07,470
Alright, let's see what we can grab.

3555

03:57:10,650 --> 03:57:11,910
No one can escape.

3624
03:57:14,610 --> 03:57:16,230
No one can escape.

3625
03:57:24,450 --> 03:57:25,050
There you go.

3626
03:57:29,710 --> 03:57:29,750
Alright.

3627
03:57:30,410 --> 03:57:30,950
We're fine.

3628
03:57:31,130 --> 03:57:32,750
See, my bot is still alive.

3629
03:57:34,650 --> 03:57:37,250
The crocodile is watching me now.

3630
03:57:37,630 --> 03:57:38,630
What the fuck do I want micro?

3631
03:57:38,890 --> 03:57:40,810
Okay, I don't know if I need, I don't know.

3632
03:57:40,810 --> 03:57:42,390
I'm really bad with a sniper in general.

3633
03:57:43,610 --> 03:57:44,130
A cord.

3634
03:57:44,610 --> 03:57:45,650
I don't know what to do with cord.

3635
03:57:48,390 --> 03:57:51,470
I'm full HP so you can take all that.

3636
03:57:56,110 --> 03:57:56,110
Here.

3637
03:57:56,610 --> 03:57:57,810
I'm a nice person.

3638
03:57:57,950 --> 03:57:59,390
I gave him a full shield.

3639
03:58:00,050 --> 03:58:01,630
Because I know... What are you doing?

3640
03:58:01,830 --> 03:58:03,050
There's nothing here.

3641
03:58:03,410 --> 03:58:05,010
The fucking...

3642
03:58:06,010 --> 03:58:08,070
Bro, take your goddamn potion.

3643
03:58:10,350 --> 03:58:12,510
I don't think he realized this is no build.

3644
03:58:15,430 --> 03:58:15,910
You...

3645
03:58:15,930 --> 03:58:35,480
think he knows this is no big or maybe he's just no you're
not even real oh my god let me grab this though we are you

3646
03:58:35,480 --> 03:58:49,660

do that he's not even real i don't understand i thought He

3647
03:58:49,660 --> 03:58:50,600
wasn't real.

3648
03:58:54,770 --> 03:58:56,890
And they almost killed me.

3649
03:58:58,730 --> 03:59:00,630
You saw you use an emote.

3650
03:59:01,310 --> 03:59:02,030
Wait, what's this?

3651
03:59:02,390 --> 03:59:03,310
What is Gold Rush?

3652
03:59:07,170 --> 03:59:08,610
What does that even mean?

3653
03:59:09,810 --> 03:59:11,650
What abilities do I have?

3654
03:59:13,210 --> 03:59:14,890
When I have Gold Rush on.

3655
03:59:17,090 --> 03:59:18,610
Wait a minute, this is a marble.

3656
03:59:18,710 --> 03:59:19,570
Yeah, I know, right?

3657
03:59:20,110 --> 03:59:20,710
Harvesting.

3658
03:59:20,710 --> 03:59:21,950
Oh, harvesting gives...

3659
03:59:21,950 --> 03:59:23,530
Oh, that's why.

3660
03:59:25,370 --> 03:59:27,190
That's why he was harvesting.

3661
03:59:27,630 --> 03:59:28,910
I see now.

3662
03:59:30,190 --> 03:59:30,450
Oh!

3663
03:59:30,910 --> 03:59:31,950
I'm rich!

3664
03:59:33,430 --> 03:59:34,110
Let's go.

3665
03:59:34,110 --> 03:59:35,490
Okay, now it's gone.

3666
03:59:35,990 --> 03:59:36,950
That ever makes sense now.

3667
03:59:37,090 --> 03:59:38,150
I was so confused.

3668
03:59:41,230 --> 03:59:41,550
Oh.

3669
03:59:43,070 --> 03:59:43,870
J-will.

3670
03:59:49,640 --> 03:59:49,940
Oh.

3671
03:59:50,900 --> 03:59:52,220
Hello, dry baller.

3672
03:59:53,420 --> 03:59:54,720
Oh, these guys are real.

3673
03:59:55,280 --> 03:59:56,620
No, these guys are fucking real.

3674
04:00:02,410 --> 04:00:05,110
Okay, I'm fucking rowing hog around.

3675
04:00:11,170 --> 04:00:11,610
There we go.

3676
04:00:16,930 --> 04:00:18,010
There we go.

3677
04:00:20,370 --> 04:00:20,650
All right.

3678
04:00:21,050 --> 04:00:21,330
Oh, hey.

3679
04:00:21,990 --> 04:00:22,550
Katana.

3680
04:00:23,850 --> 04:00:25,150
Yeah, you like my flick there?

3681
04:00:25,390 --> 04:00:26,570
That's fucking right.

3682
04:00:27,650 --> 04:00:28,610
Wait, is he spectating?

3683
04:00:34,970 --> 04:00:35,930
I just...

3684
04:00:35,930 --> 04:00:37,670
In case the man is...

3685
04:00:37,670 --> 04:00:40,450
That guy was real, but he was pretty bad.

3686
04:00:43,190 --> 04:00:45,030
He was real and bad.

3687
04:00:46,810 --> 04:00:48,630
All right, let's go pick him up.

3688
04:00:48,710 --> 04:00:49,910
Thanks for the gold, buddy.

3689
04:00:55,330 --> 04:00:56,030
There we go.

3690
04:00:58,830 --> 04:01:00,050
I mean, we could res him.

3691
04:01:01,230 --> 04:01:01,950
It's fine.

3692
04:01:03,710 --> 04:01:04,770
I'll res my bot.

3693
04:01:06,130 --> 04:01:06,510
It's fine.

3694
04:01:06,630 --> 04:01:07,190
It's just a...

3695
04:01:07,190 --> 04:01:07,570
Oh, my God.

3696
04:01:07,630 --> 04:01:08,670
I'm not resing him, guys.

3697
04:01:08,810 --> 04:01:09,790
I'm going to a Zorim.

3698
04:01:09,990 --> 04:01:10,610
Fuck that shit.

3699
04:01:10,730 --> 04:01:12,250
That guy's not even a real person.

3700
04:01:12,370 --> 04:01:13,690
Like, he doesn't need it.

3701
04:01:20,700 --> 04:01:23,320
This is not how I remember where I was looking.

3702
04:01:26,120 --> 04:01:27,020
Yeah, it's crazy.

3703
04:01:27,280 --> 04:01:28,140
Rivals got a new update.

3704
04:01:28,520 --> 04:01:29,820
Mr. Beast, they added Mr. Beast.

3705
04:01:30,620 --> 04:01:34,080
Mr. Beast, I mean, his soul is already sold.

3706
04:01:34,240 --> 04:01:37,520
But, like, I guess he sold a portion of his soul to Disney
as well.

3707
04:01:37,780 --> 04:01:41,000
So now, now we get Mr. Beast in rival Rivals.

3708
04:01:41,340 --> 04:01:41,980
Isn't that crazy?

3709
04:01:47,630 --> 04:01:50,190
Yeah, they added a battle royale in Rivals.

3710
04:01:51,910 --> 04:01:53,230
What the fuck was that?

3711
04:01:54,130 --> 04:01:55,090
You guys heard that, right?

3712
04:01:57,690 --> 04:01:59,170
for Mr. Fantastic.

3713
04:01:59,670 --> 04:02:00,710
Yeah, this is...

3714
04:02:00,710 --> 04:02:04,390
They added a new skin for...

3715
04:02:04,390 --> 04:02:08,050
They have, like, content creator collabs now in Rivals.

3716
04:02:08,610 --> 04:02:09,750
And they added...

3717
04:02:09,750 --> 04:02:15,150
So, you know, you can change your Mr. Fantastic skin and put
it on Mr. Beast.

3718
04:02:15,550 --> 04:02:16,450
That's wild.

3719
04:02:20,470 --> 04:02:22,390
Rivals truly is beautiful.

3720
04:02:27,310 --> 04:02:29,710
Yeah, you can play Ninja Star Lord.

3721
04:02:29,730 --> 04:02:32,210
Mr. Beast, that's Mr. Fantastic.

3722
04:02:37,470 --> 04:02:38,850
Alright, let's Rizzer.

3723
04:02:39,750 --> 04:02:40,210
Let's Rizzer.

3724
04:02:42,330 --> 04:02:44,130
You know, if you help me, it'd be faster.

3725
04:02:48,720 --> 04:02:50,620
You know, you help me right here.

3726
04:02:54,810 --> 04:02:56,490
Speed as Blade.

3727
04:02:59,130 --> 04:02:59,630
There we go.

3728
04:02:59,710 --> 04:03:01,930
Welcome back, Dynasty Badge.

3729
04:03:04,850 --> 04:03:06,310
I don't like that.

3730
04:03:06,790 --> 04:03:08,390
What the fuck did it do to me?

3731
04:03:08,510 --> 04:03:09,570
Why am I marked?

3732
04:03:13,210 --> 04:03:14,390
Why am I marked?

3733
04:03:15,170 --> 04:03:16,750
What the fuck is that?

3734
04:03:20,070 --> 04:03:21,190
They marked me.

3735
04:03:22,310 --> 04:03:23,970
They put something on me.

3736
04:03:25,470 --> 04:03:26,990
What did they put on me?

3737
04:03:32,600 --> 04:03:34,740
Guys, what the fuck did they put on me?

3738
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:36,960
Oh, do I have a bounty?

3739
04:03:37,140 --> 04:03:37,960
Oh, it expired.

3740
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:39,420
Oh, I guess the guy died.

3741
04:03:42,140 --> 04:03:46,120
I think the guy that got my bounty fucking just collapsed, I
guess.

3742
04:03:50,990 --> 04:03:56,490
Spider-pig, spider-pig does whatever spider-pig does.

3743
04:03:58,690 --> 04:04:00,870
Uh, no, he can't.

3744
04:04:01,170 --> 04:04:01,890
He can see.

3745
04:04:02,330 --> 04:04:03,630
It's just a pig.

3746
04:04:03,950 --> 04:04:04,850
Watch out.

3747
04:04:06,870 --> 04:04:07,670
What?

3748
04:04:10,030 --> 04:04:12,510
Where are those shots, anyway?

3749
04:04:20,730 --> 04:04:22,610
I don't even think I can hit that.

3750
04:04:24,230 --> 04:04:24,350
Oh.

3751
04:04:26,230 --> 04:04:27,230
Yeah, never mind.

3752
04:04:27,870 --> 04:04:27,870
Run.

3753
04:04:29,150 --> 04:04:32,730
Oh, shit.

3754
04:04:33,090 --> 04:04:33,650
Oh, shit.

3755
04:04:34,810 --> 04:04:35,230
Oh, fuck.

3756
04:04:35,390 --> 04:04:35,730
I'm marked.

3757
04:04:43,830 --> 04:04:44,490
Oh, my God.

3758
04:04:44,610 --> 04:04:45,970
He's marking me and I'm...

3759
04:04:45,970 --> 04:04:46,710
He's...

3760
04:04:46,710 --> 04:04:47,190
Oh, my God.

3761
04:04:47,270 --> 04:04:48,030
We marked each other.

3762
04:04:48,770 --> 04:04:49,310
What the fuck?

3763
04:04:49,390 --> 04:04:51,310
Why you have a bounty on me, bitch?

3764
04:04:55,000 --> 04:04:56,560
Okay, now the bounty god.

3765
04:05:02,420 --> 04:05:03,720
Okay, he got a car, too.

3766
04:05:05,600 --> 04:05:07,500
I'm, like, a little worried right now.

3767
04:05:08,980 --> 04:05:09,920
Okay, I hope my guy...

3768
04:05:09,920 --> 04:05:10,820
Okay, he's got him.

3769
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:13,180
There we go.

3770
04:05:15,580 --> 04:05:16,960
Okay, he, like, ran...

3771
04:05:16,960 --> 04:05:17,140
Oh!

3772
04:05:26,860 --> 04:05:27,280
Like...

3773
04:05:28,080 --> 04:05:29,320
What's the goal here?

3774
04:05:31,540 --> 04:05:32,320
Oh, my God.

3775
04:05:32,420 --> 04:05:32,750
I should...

3776
04:05:36,560 --> 04:05:36,980
No!

3777
04:05:37,200 --> 04:05:37,900
I wanted...

3778
04:05:40,600 --> 04:05:42,020
I should have just accepted him.

3779
04:05:42,320 --> 04:05:42,860
I should have...

3780
04:05:44,860 --> 04:05:47,280
I should have just done it.

3781
04:05:47,520 --> 04:05:49,140
I should have just done it.

3782
04:05:49,520 --> 04:05:51,800
I should have just done it.

3783
04:05:53,660 --> 04:05:56,860
I was like, what the fuck is he doing?

3784
04:06:02,540 --> 04:06:03,080
No, no.

3785
04:06:03,240 --> 04:06:04,100
They were not bots.

3786
04:06:04,220 --> 04:06:05,280
I got out of car.

3787
04:06:05,760 --> 04:06:06,840
I had a car.

3788
04:06:07,160 --> 04:06:07,420
Don't worry.

3789
04:06:07,440 --> 04:06:10,140
I got the real key.

3790
04:06:11,640 --> 04:06:12,720
Whatever his name is.

3791
04:06:14,800 --> 04:06:16,420
Where's my Scooby-Doo running?

3792
04:06:16,440 --> 04:06:16,900
anyway.

3793
04:06:17,740 --> 04:06:19,520
Oh, I have more emotes now.

3794
04:06:19,800 --> 04:06:21,440
Oh, they gave me more slots.

3795
04:06:22,200 --> 04:06:23,080
That's nice.

3796
04:06:25,640 --> 04:06:27,940
Yeah, I have more slots now.

3797
04:06:29,560 --> 04:06:30,000
They are.

3798
04:06:32,260 --> 04:06:34,780
Wait, I gotta put... Where's the Scooby-Doo run?

3799
04:06:38,220 --> 04:06:38,720
Proversal.

3800
04:06:39,980 --> 04:06:41,180
Is that the Scooby-Doo run?

3801
04:06:41,280 --> 04:06:41,980
Oh, there we go.

3802
04:06:43,000 --> 04:06:45,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3803
04:06:46,440 --> 04:06:47,640
That's so stupid.

3804
04:06:47,940 --> 04:06:48,780
Woo, woo, woo!

3805
04:06:54,200 --> 04:06:56,920
I'm trying to figure out where is it.

3806
04:06:59,480 --> 04:06:59,920
Alright.

3807
04:07:00,260 --> 04:07:00,760
My guy...

3808
04:07:00,760 --> 04:07:02,580
Oh, my guy dropped off already.

3809
04:07:05,920 --> 04:07:06,620
Any update?

3810
04:07:06,740 --> 04:07:08,480
I think I would be told if...

3811
04:07:08,480 --> 04:07:10,040
If it's my turn yet.

3812
04:07:10,140 --> 04:07:12,080
Nobody said anything in Discord.

3813
04:07:14,380 --> 04:07:15,740
Oh, Ra-Ra-Ra-Ra-Gy.

3814
04:07:15,940 --> 04:07:17,140

3815
04:07:17,140 --> 04:07:18,200

My guy died.

3828
04:09:21,950 --> 04:09:22,350
How?

3829
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:29,440
Wait, he's dead.

3830
04:09:30,100 --> 04:09:31,440
Where's his body?

3831
04:09:32,120 --> 04:09:32,840
Wait a minute.

3832
04:09:34,360 --> 04:09:35,300
Wait.

3833
04:09:35,520 --> 04:09:36,280
What?

3834
04:09:40,040 --> 04:09:40,680
Where?

3835
04:09:41,600 --> 04:09:42,200
Where?

3836
04:09:42,840 --> 04:09:43,380
Where?

3837
04:09:43,900 --> 04:09:45,660
Where is this body?

3838
04:09:47,340 --> 04:09:48,640
Bro, why did he left?

3839
04:09:48,760 --> 04:09:50,260
Is it cause I'm Mr. Beast?

3840
04:09:52,840 --> 04:09:54,040
Why did he leave?

3841
04:09:59,060 --> 04:10:01,480
Oh god, there's like a whole team there.

3842
04:10:04,920 --> 04:10:07,580
He saw Mr. Beast and left.

3843
04:10:08,420 --> 04:10:10,600
I missed the Simpsons map, though, by the way.

3844
04:10:11,120 --> 04:10:12,700
I think the Simpsons map was so fun.

3845
04:10:14,860 --> 04:10:17,880
He knows what foul sins you're about to commit.

3846
04:10:18,200 --> 04:10:19,600
I didn't commit them yet.

3847
04:10:20,900 --> 04:10:23,980
I still had time before I do crime.

3848
04:10:27,870 --> 04:10:29,970
Does anyone know where to play from now?

3849
04:10:30,410 --> 04:10:31,510
It was like, what?

3850
04:10:31,670 --> 04:10:35,830
I think we're waiting for this last game to be over.

3851
04:10:36,950 --> 04:10:37,750
Okay, last game.

3852
04:10:38,030 --> 04:10:38,370
Thank you.

3853
04:10:39,430 --> 04:10:39,910
All right.

3854
04:10:40,950 --> 04:10:44,830
Yeah, but if he died on spawn, I- What the fuck?

3855
04:10:44,970 --> 04:10:46,250
How did he die?

3856
04:10:48,730 --> 04:10:50,410
Even get to his body!

3857
04:10:50,610 --> 04:10:51,230
I'm just...

3858
04:10:51,230 --> 04:10:52,570
I'm trash, I guess.

3859
04:10:53,370 --> 04:10:54,590
Wait, you can hide in here?

3860
04:10:54,710 --> 04:10:56,030
Wait, that's broken as hell.

3861
04:10:59,110 --> 04:11:01,310
I think the worst part is for EU players, too.

3862
04:11:01,750 --> 04:11:02,070
Yeah.

3863
04:11:02,690 --> 04:11:05,830
For EU players, they gotta fucking stay up for so long.

3864
04:11:05,990 --> 04:11:07,910
Guys, I might as well just go die, I guess.

3865
04:11:08,030 --> 04:11:09,330
Like, what the fuck do I do?

3866
04:11:14,830 --> 04:11:16,190
What the fuck?

3867
04:11:17,550 --> 04:11:19,790
Oh my god, what is this game?

3868
04:11:20,970 --> 04:11:22,370
What the fuck is this game?

3869
04:11:25,490 --> 04:11:26,970
Yeah, I know it's crazy.

3870
04:11:28,110 --> 04:11:30,510
Not really a fan of the organization style of this.

3871
04:11:30,670 --> 04:11:34,190
I would have just, like, if you're not being broadcast, just
fucking...

3872
04:11:35,730 --> 04:11:36,850
Just play all the...

3873
04:11:36,850 --> 04:11:38,850
Play the games all at once.

3874
04:11:38,890 --> 04:11:40,150
Like, stream them all at once.

3875
04:11:40,250 --> 04:11:41,190
Like, there's no point.

3876
04:11:42,690 --> 04:11:43,950
That's why I'm, like, surprised.

3877
04:11:47,230 --> 04:11:49,410
I'm surprised like we did that.

3878
04:11:49,790 --> 04:11:50,590
But what is this?

3879
04:11:51,270 --> 04:11:51,710
Portabunker.

3880
04:11:51,830 --> 04:11:53,650
Oh, Portabunker is good, though.

3881
04:11:54,850 --> 04:11:58,610
But I'm gonna this so I can...

3882
04:12:00,840 --> 04:12:02,620
I'm going for the fight right now.

3883
04:12:03,960 --> 04:12:05,140
Like, I'm going for the fight.

3884
04:12:05,260 --> 04:12:07,580
All I have is shotguns, but I'm going for it.

3885
04:12:09,320 --> 04:12:10,940
Oh, what the fuck?

3886
04:12:12,080 --> 04:12:12,580
Oh, wait.

3887
04:12:12,620 --> 04:12:14,540
This is a bot versus bot fight.

3888
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:15,900
This is it.

3889
04:12:15,920 --> 04:12:17,200
This is my time to shine.

3890
04:12:17,660 --> 04:12:19,000
5v bot

3891
04:12:23,140 --> 04:12:24,420
Don't worry

3892
04:12:32,020 --> 04:12:45,490
Don't worry I have to I know he's our bot But you don't
understand This was very important to me

3893
04:12:50,750 --> 04:12:52,030
Don't worry

3894
04:13:00,400 --> 04:13:12,400
I know like He's not real He's not real But he's real to me
He's real now Where the Fuck Where are they?

3895
04:13:13,840 --> 04:13:14,780
Where's the last one?

3896
04:13:15,100 --> 04:13:16,940
Is it finally time?

3897
04:13:17,860 --> 04:13:20,780
I feel like people are just fucking falling asleep while we
wait.

3898
04:13:21,360 --> 04:13:22,440
Wait, do we play now?

3899
04:13:23,080 --> 04:13:25,500
I got invited to a lobby, so yeah.

3900
04:13:25,900 --> 04:13:26,360
Oh god.

3901
04:13:27,100 --> 04:13:28,420
Oh no, please.

3902
04:13:29,640 --> 04:13:30,600
I'm six, seven.

3903
04:13:30,900 --> 04:13:32,480
This made him real.

3904
04:13:33,540 --> 04:13:34,760
He's real now.

3905
04:13:38,850 --> 04:13:39,590
Don't worry.

04:14:22,860 --> 04:14:23,780
Don't do it.

3910
04:14:23,780 --> 04:14:24,420
Don't do it.

3911
04:14:26,620 --> 04:14:27,700
Okay, that's good timing.

3912
04:14:27,940 --> 04:14:30,640
I had to run the swap games anyway.

3913
04:14:31,080 --> 04:14:31,660
I had to go.

3914
04:14:32,060 --> 04:14:32,980
I had to swap.

3915
04:14:33,120 --> 04:14:33,480
It's okay.

3916
04:14:33,540 --> 04:14:34,920
I didn't get emoted on.

3917
04:14:35,220 --> 04:14:36,940
I was gonna do it too.

3918
04:14:37,200 --> 04:14:37,840
I was trying to.

3919
04:14:38,120 --> 04:14:40,000
I was trying to do it.

3920
04:14:42,500 --> 04:14:44,320
You got what you did.

3921
04:14:44,680 --> 04:14:46,660
I was about to pull it.

3922
04:14:47,060 --> 04:14:48,600
I knew I was gonna die.

3923
04:14:49,580 --> 04:14:53,000
That's why I stood there because I was trying to e-mote.

3924
04:14:55,140 --> 04:14:58,940
Oh, I got drove by Batman and Eminem.

3925
04:14:59,120 --> 04:14:59,760
I did.

3926
04:15:01,180 --> 04:15:03,220
I used to bathroom now, too.

3927
04:15:04,000 --> 04:15:06,190
Oh, I had to...

3928
04:15:06,620 --> 04:15:09,380
I played in four hours.

3929
04:15:09,580 --> 04:15:12,120
This will be my second game.

3930
04:15:12,800 --> 04:15:14,360
In four hours.

3931
04:15:16,540 --> 04:15:17,940
Holy fuck.

3932
04:15:24,730 --> 04:15:29,110

04:16:06,780 --> 04:16:07,920
Oh, we're back.

3937
04:19:32,620 --> 04:19:32,980
Hello.

3938
04:19:34,800 --> 04:19:35,320
Hello.

3939
04:19:36,160 --> 04:19:37,700
I think we're missing Doki only.

3940
04:19:40,580 --> 04:19:42,860
Doki, but I am right here.

3941
04:19:43,880 --> 04:19:44,540
Cool.

3942
04:19:45,560 --> 04:19:46,780
I am back.

3943
04:19:48,120 --> 04:19:48,700
All right.

3944
04:19:49,020 --> 04:19:49,900
Let's see.

3945
04:19:50,780 --> 04:19:51,920
Okay, I'm back.

3946
04:19:52,040 --> 04:19:52,980
Let me do this.

3947
04:19:53,080 --> 04:19:55,160
I just got back just in time.

3948
04:19:55,540 --> 04:19:55,900
All right.

3949
04:19:57,020 --> 04:19:59,960
Uh, let me get the key button up.

3950
04:20:01,960 --> 04:20:03,640
You guys enjoy the fun show.

3951
04:20:05,440 --> 04:20:06,740
The fun little show.

3952
04:20:08,260 --> 04:20:09,400
Practically for free.

3953
04:20:09,560 --> 04:20:11,080
Usually Venom doesn't do it for free.

3954
04:20:11,540 --> 04:20:12,120
But he always me.

3955
04:20:12,580 --> 04:20:13,840
But he and I go way back.

3956
04:20:14,320 --> 04:20:16,620
So, you know.

3957
04:20:17,320 --> 04:20:19,440
He and I go way back guys.

3958
04:20:26,680 --> 04:20:29,020
Alright, their team is incredibly stacked.

3959
04:20:29,560 --> 04:20:31,820
What the fuck?

3960
04:20:33,220 --> 04:20:35,020
This team is very stacked.

3961
04:20:36,320 --> 04:20:36,960
Wait a minute.

3962
04:20:42,350 --> 04:20:43,550
They were waiting for me?

3963
04:20:44,390 --> 04:20:44,590
Oh.

3964
04:20:46,030 --> 04:20:46,750
They were?

3965
04:20:47,550 --> 04:20:49,210
I just got back.

3966
04:20:56,850 --> 04:20:57,730
Were they?

3967
04:20:58,170 --> 04:20:59,170
What are they asking?

3968
04:21:04,710 --> 04:21:05,770
No one is talking.

3969
04:21:05,790 --> 04:21:06,290
talking.

3970
04:21:07,170 --> 04:21:11,150
I can't just be like, hey guys, nobody's talking.

3971
04:21:15,750 --> 04:21:18,970
Oh, okay, they're just checking in.

3972
04:21:19,070 --> 04:21:19,610
Well, I'm here.

3973
04:21:20,370 --> 04:21:22,950
Also, that chicken nuggets did not sit well with me.

3974
04:21:24,990 --> 04:21:29,710
I think that I think I remember why I haven't had chicken
nuggets in a long time.

3975
04:21:30,590 --> 04:21:31,350
I'm already in here.

3976
04:21:31,510 --> 04:21:34,190
I don't think I have to say hi if I'm already in.

3977
04:21:37,450 --> 04:21:38,570
It was not okay.

3978
04:21:42,500 --> 04:21:45,620
I think they have the most stacked team in general.

3979
04:21:46,140 --> 04:21:48,340
I mean, they also have a Spider-Man one trick, too.

3980
04:21:48,500 --> 04:21:48,960
What the fuck?

3981
04:21:51,320 --> 04:21:52,820
Yeah, they were bad Nuggies.

3982
04:21:53,040 --> 04:21:54,380
Those were some bad Nuggies.

3983
04:21:54,840 --> 04:21:56,020
They literally have...

3984
04:21:56,020 --> 04:21:56,500
Let's see.

3985
04:21:56,560 --> 04:21:57,220
They have Guru.

3986
04:21:57,780 --> 04:21:58,200
This is not...

3987
04:21:58,200 --> 04:21:59,140
That's not Tim the Tabman.

3988
04:21:59,260 --> 04:21:59,740
That's Guru.

3989
04:21:59,900 --> 04:22:02,660
They have Guru, Crimson, Melio.

3990
04:22:03,140 --> 04:22:04,520
Their pros are...

3991
04:22:04,520 --> 04:22:06,320
Well, their pros are Melio and Crimson.

3992
04:22:07,580 --> 04:22:07,980
But...

3993
04:22:09,100 --> 04:22:19,680
really good spider-man um and drew is a really good tank
player kg is a really good support player and jimbo is also

3994
04:22:19,680 --> 04:22:32,210
a good support player too their team is pretty good like on
paper yeah i would say day would be is a better spider-man

3995
04:22:32,210 --> 04:22:40,990
than zeal due to like i've seen him like in high you though
all the time well not now but like spider-man's not in the

3996
04:22:40,990 --> 04:22:45,970
meta to be fair spider-man isn't meta i will say

3997
04:22:52,230 --> 04:23:06,850
no it's weird if i just said hi guys it'd be weird it's
about social cues guys no i don't even know if it's the last

3998
04:23:06,850 --> 04:23:14,970
game of the day let me look i did make my message and no
Okay, round six onwards is...

3999
04:23:14,970 --> 04:23:16,470
Alright, which is round six?

4000
04:23:16,830 --> 04:23:18,650
Oh my god.

4001
04:23:18,830 --> 04:23:20,010
Okay, it's fine.

4002
04:23:20,530 --> 04:23:23,070
Day two is round...

4003
04:23:23,070 --> 04:23:25,390
Okay, day two is round six.

4004
04:23:26,290 --> 04:23:27,010
So...

4005
04:23:27,010 --> 04:23:27,510
Ha ha.

4006
04:23:28,390 --> 04:23:30,050
I didn't say it!

4007
04:23:30,690 --> 04:23:32,550
We are on round four.

4008
04:23:32,930 --> 04:23:34,930
We are on round four.

4009
04:23:36,170 --> 04:23:37,550
We're on round four.

4010
04:23:39,450 --> 04:23:40,830
It's not Tim.

4011
04:23:40,890 --> 04:23:41,430
It's Guru.

4012
04:23:41,450 --> 04:23:43,130
That's not Tim.

4013
04:23:44,590 --> 04:23:50,670
Tim gave Guru like a hundred subs to put him so that he
would look like he's on top 500.

4014
04:23:53,030 --> 04:23:54,330
I mean, that's smart.

4015
04:23:54,730 --> 04:23:57,330
That's free advertising for him and Guru.

4016
04:23:58,550 --> 04:23:59,830
That's free money for him.

4017
04:24:02,330 --> 04:24:03,570
But it says Tim.

4018
04:24:03,750 --> 04:24:07,110
Guys, I know identity theft is a serious problem.

4019
04:24:12,270 --> 04:24:14,730
It is a very big problem.

4020
04:24:21,220 --> 04:24:21,740
Yeah.

4021
04:24:22,280 --> 04:24:23,280
People just do that?

4022
04:24:23,640 --> 04:24:24,300
Lie on the internet?

4023
04:24:24,540 --> 04:24:25,400
I know, right?

4024
04:24:27,080 --> 04:24:28,340
That's fucked up.

4025
04:24:30,320 --> 04:24:35,880
I will say their DPS lineup is stronger than our DPS lineup
because they literally have a pro player.

4026
04:24:37,380 --> 04:24:38,680
Melly's a really good DPS player.

4027
04:24:46,960 --> 04:24:48,200
I mean, they know I'm here.

4028
04:24:48,400 --> 04:24:49,640
I'm literally in the lobby.

4029
04:24:52,380 --> 04:24:53,660
I'm in the lobby.

4030
04:24:53,940 --> 04:24:54,960
Where else can I be?

4031
04:24:55,620 --> 04:24:55,820
Oh,

4032
04:24:58,960 --> 04:24:59,640
yeah, bro.

4033
04:25:00,000 --> 04:25:00,720
That's true.

4034
04:25:01,060 --> 04:25:03,200
I do have Ryan Goslin.

4035
04:25:04,200 --> 04:25:05,300
That's true.

4036
04:25:11,670 --> 04:25:12,730
Are we waiting on something?

4037
04:25:13,590 --> 04:25:13,790
Or?

4038
04:25:17,890 --> 04:25:18,450
Yeah.

4039
04:25:19,690 --> 04:25:20,350
They're in lobby.

4040
04:25:20,510 --> 04:25:21,250
Are we waiting on the broadcast?

4041
04:25:22,190 --> 04:25:22,890
I think it's the broadcast.

4042
04:25:23,290 --> 04:25:25,210
Maybe they're just yapping, you know?

4043
04:25:26,530 --> 04:25:37,990
doing commentary okay no they're having a break all right
see i said something guys what are we thinking of fans for

4044
04:25:37,990 --> 04:25:52,110
this team by the way oh they're definitely listening so yeah
is is he behind your door i mean milia is pretty good at

4045
04:25:52,110 --> 04:26:00,850
everything and they is like a flex kind of i think i think
he's yeah i think he won he doesn't even he doesn't even

4046
04:26:00,850 --> 04:26:11,590
care about spider-man i feel like i don't know if you
watched yeah yeah i think maybe yeah rockets good too like

4047
04:26:11,590 --> 04:26:18,810
maybe hella rocket my social interaction yeah first ban
hella in my opinion i don't have to worry about bats i'm

4048
04:26:18,810 --> 04:26:29,810
just sure and then ban rocket doesn't doesn't don't they
play daredevil don't think so i don't think they'll play

4049
04:26:29,810 --> 04:26:37,230
daredevil didn't really play it i don't know the because the
other team didn't bat it i think yeah i don't think this

4050
04:26:37,230 --> 04:26:51,170
team plays daredevil um okay okay yeah hella rocket ban and
like really it's anything for the third that we'd want okay

4051
04:26:51,170 --> 04:27:05,970
we'll figure it out his group but that does go yeah they do
protect they do protect groups to be fair yeah i think i

4052
04:27:05,970 --> 04:27:14,410
think the rocket is more important personally yeah yeah
everyone good luck yeah yeah if we go inside my pocket you

4053
04:27:14,410 --> 04:27:27,650
players and do my first fan hell or rocket first then uh i
think we can get hell if you want yeah all right oh did oh

4054
04:27:27,650 --> 04:27:38,110
the side face team lost oh i feel so bad for side face team
yeah but they they feel so bad for side face they were the

4055
04:27:38,110 --> 04:27:47,550
ones banning their double wasn't he wait wasn't he in the
boker bash and all right and he was on i'm falling asleep

4056
04:27:47,550 --> 04:27:56,970
man it was on the booger bash right did he make it the day
two they did not play in their double at all there was a

4057
04:27:56,970 --> 04:28:07,310
game where they didn't even ban it on both teams and neither
team played it oh yeah yeah no i meant like the last the

4058
04:28:07,310 --> 04:28:18,170
last booger bash oh no they got third place okay yeah he got
out and loki quick that's it feels bad yeah no they're out

4059
04:28:18,170 --> 04:28:24,170
melee was best at like scale site-based team is pulled out
yeah i think we can we can just do the hella the hella ben

4060
04:28:25,310 --> 04:28:34,250
that's unfortunate i don't want to stop on that cough drop i
don't remember kent took on candy right now i was like i was

4061
04:28:34,250 --> 04:28:43,490
like okay to be fair they did ban spiderman every single map
so i don't know if he even wants to play that uh yeah but

4062
04:28:43,490 --> 04:28:54,570
they're full out now yeah we should lucky them their weight
is over this is like one of the better spider-man maps uh if

4063
04:28:54,570 --> 04:29:02,950
we do get the opportunity to bennett that one map with like
the full wait who won versus who won it's so annoying uh

4064
04:29:02,950 --> 04:29:10,490
people always get put off the side there um necros versus j3
who lost necros or j3 oh i know what to do i see who's still

4065
04:29:10,490 --> 04:29:16,470
streaming necros i mean we could we could take the gamble if
you want necros is oh wait are you playing in there spidey

4066
04:29:16,470 --> 04:29:21,830
first and then hello oh they are they're rocket second
they're playing now Or we can just secure the hella and then

4067
04:29:21,830 --> 04:29:22,810
get Spidey last a bit.

4068
04:29:23,270 --> 04:29:24,050
Oh, wait, J3.

4069
04:29:24,070 --> 04:29:25,190
No, we can just do the hella.

4070
04:29:25,850 --> 04:29:26,350
All right.

4071
04:29:26,670 --> 04:29:28,110
Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud.

4072
04:29:29,210 --> 04:29:29,350
Yeah.

4073
04:29:32,990 --> 04:29:34,250
If they lost, they're out.

4074
04:29:34,590 --> 04:29:35,130
They're out out.

4075
04:29:36,130 --> 04:29:37,750
This also is a very good hella map.

4076
04:29:38,350 --> 04:29:38,350
So.

4077
04:29:41,150 --> 04:29:41,870
Oh, no, J3.

4078
04:29:42,090 --> 04:29:44,730
Yeah, I'm going to say that doesn't make sense because I
literally see him streaming.

4079
04:29:45,210 --> 04:29:45,910
No, J3.

4080
04:29:46,310 --> 04:29:47,830
Yeah, J3 is in rank now.

4081
04:29:49,350 --> 04:29:50,050
He's in rank.

4082
04:29:50,370 --> 04:29:51,470
Oh, for most.

4083
04:29:51,490 --> 04:29:58,370
i feel bad for mocha you can stall out phoenix maybe i feel
bad for mocha because mocha i think since we're banning

4084
04:29:58,370 --> 04:30:04,810
hello you can probably just play starlord mocha didn't have
good luck with the boker bash as well because like they lost

4085
04:30:04,810 --> 04:30:11,630
every game to be honest phoenix lucky and star lord just
play those that's like a very sad outcome whatever you guys

4086
04:30:11,630 --> 04:30:13,410

only team with two support players as their picks too i

Yeah, we have to wait for the interview now.

4097
04:31:25,070 --> 04:31:25,990
That was so much nicer.

4098
04:31:26,470 --> 04:31:29,250
The other guy came in and said, okay, you're doing an
interview.

4099
04:31:32,470 --> 04:31:34,150
This guy was nice.

4100
04:31:35,750 --> 04:31:36,970
The last guy's Greek.

4101
04:31:37,190 --> 04:31:37,790
Give him a break.

4102
04:31:39,430 --> 04:31:40,310
Oh, damn.

4103
04:31:41,370 --> 04:31:43,150
European dragons, is this true?

4104
04:31:44,130 --> 04:31:46,810
I mean, one one sounded British, and I guess the other one's
Greek.

4105
04:31:50,070 --> 04:31:51,990
Oh man, thank you for the super chat.

4106
04:31:52,190 --> 04:31:52,370
Thank you.

4107
04:31:53,310 --> 04:31:53,750
Thank you.

4108
04:31:54,190 --> 04:31:55,370
Wait, what time is it for you right now?

4109
04:31:55,610 --> 04:31:55,690
Team Captain.

4110
04:31:55,970 --> 04:31:56,710
Do you like Roguelite games?

4111
04:31:57,190 --> 04:31:58,250
I highly recommend Mortalson.

4112
04:31:58,370 --> 04:31:59,690
The file boss has only been killed.

4113
04:32:00,390 --> 04:32:02,550
That's never finishing that game.

4114
04:32:02,690 --> 04:32:03,330
Oh, wow.

4115
04:32:04,350 --> 04:32:05,390
For me, it's almost 10, man.

4116
04:32:09,010 --> 04:32:09,890
It's about...

4117
04:32:09,890 --> 04:32:10,650
It's okay, man.

4118
04:32:10,950 --> 04:32:12,310
It's about...

4119
04:32:12,310 --> 04:32:14,650
It's like two more hours at most, I think.

4120
04:32:15,070 --> 04:32:15,510
It's okay.

4121
04:32:16,270 --> 04:32:16,990
You can do it.

4122
04:32:18,150 --> 04:32:18,590
Wow.

4123
04:32:18,610 --> 04:32:20,890
It's doing nothing for so long, makes it pass.

4124
04:32:23,690 --> 04:32:25,610
When's the schedule for tomorrow?

4125
04:32:25,810 --> 04:32:26,790
Do you guys know when we start?

4126
04:32:27,690 --> 04:32:29,550
Yeah, it's on the Excel file.

4127
04:32:29,690 --> 04:32:30,790
I don't know if you opened it.

4128
04:32:31,470 --> 04:32:37,190
But it says the first match of tomorrow starts at 1215 ESD.

4129
04:32:37,770 --> 04:32:39,670
I don't know what that is in the EU for you guys.

4130
04:32:39,870 --> 04:32:40,370
I'll check.

4131
04:32:42,990 --> 04:32:44,810
I think tomorrow is losers bucket now.

4132
04:32:45,310 --> 04:32:46,950
Yeah, tomorrow is losers and grand finals.

4133
04:32:47,650 --> 04:32:47,970
Oh.

4134
04:32:48,610 --> 04:33:03,410
yeah so it's five and then until 350 esd so what's that like
four hours six hours ahead yeah yeah yeah that's fine yeah

4135
04:33:03,410 --> 04:33:10,050
so like nine nine fifty it's the latest game so it's
probably gonna start even earlier because these games seem

4136
04:33:10,050 --> 04:33:21,640
to go by fast i'll put it it's just how long we have to wait
this for a game of these yeah i mean this one was scheduled

4137
04:33:21,640 --> 04:33:31,480
for for five but i swear we've been waiting since like 4 30
if not earlier yeah yeah oh it's been much much longer yeah

4138
04:33:31,480 --> 04:33:38,380
much longer since the game started like since the game
finished the one before us oh maybe not maybe just 4 30.

4139
04:33:38,780 --> 04:33:42,460
yeah i think i think it's 4 30 or something like that i was
watching it

4140
04:33:50,760 --> 04:33:53,040
I'm gonna see what Gail says.

4141
04:33:57,090 --> 04:33:57,910
He's a PR guy.

4142
04:34:01,370 --> 04:34:02,150
He's free.

4143
04:34:02,450 --> 04:34:02,970
Gail is in.

4144
04:34:03,030 --> 04:34:03,350
Nice.

4145
04:34:07,840 --> 04:34:09,880
Is there a delay on the broadcast or no?

4146
04:34:10,520 --> 04:34:11,000
Very little.

4147
04:34:11,280 --> 04:34:11,680
No delay.

4148
04:34:11,980 --> 04:34:12,520
That's very little.

4149
04:34:12,540 --> 04:34:13,180
Oh, no delay.

4150
04:34:13,540 --> 04:34:14,060
Zero delay.

4151
04:34:14,800 --> 04:34:14,900
Zero delay.

4152
04:34:14,900 --> 04:34:15,700
I think there's zero delay.

4153
04:34:16,080 --> 04:34:16,780
Phil what I've seen.

4154
04:34:20,700 --> 04:34:21,620
He's close to zero.

4155
04:34:42,650 --> 04:34:43,670
Sorry, I did this to Sue.

4156
04:34:43,690 --> 04:34:57,750
associate guys but I'm just I had to disassociate this has
been almost five hours I I was not in the vtuber tournament

4157
04:34:57,750 --> 04:35:10,790
this the tournament was five hours but I I swear I felt I
I'm pretty sure I played like seven games already at the

4158
04:35:10,790 --> 04:35:26,030
five hour mark I was on game number seven it's the five hour
mark for this tournament and I'm on game number two right

4159
04:35:26,030 --> 04:35:37,130
now I'm fucking losing it right now I'm fucking losing it

4160
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:04,350
This tournament could have been an email.

4161
04:36:06,350 --> 04:36:06,670
What?

4162
04:36:12,180 --> 04:36:12,720
Oh.

4163
04:36:21,830 --> 04:36:23,010
It'll be fine.

4164
04:36:27,730 --> 04:36:29,350
It'll be fine.

4165
04:36:33,860 --> 04:36:39,440
It's just, I think, like, I hope it would be fine if, like,
after this tournament, I'm piecing out.

4166
04:36:40,100 --> 04:36:42,240
But I still, my day doesn't end.

4167
04:36:42,380 --> 04:36:43,400
after this tournament.

4168
04:36:43,420 --> 04:36:44,660
I thought I could take a nap.

4169
04:36:45,000 --> 04:36:47,740
I thought I could take a nap after this tournament.

4170
04:36:48,940 --> 04:36:51,280
Oh my god, there is no nap time.

4171
04:36:53,880 --> 04:36:56,040
No, I'm not good.

4172
04:36:56,420 --> 04:37:00,220
I just realized I don't even get a nap time.

4173
04:37:00,500 --> 04:37:01,420
I go straight.

4174
04:37:01,740 --> 04:37:04,200
I go straight to the maid cafe.

4175
04:37:10,570 --> 04:37:11,210
Countdown.

4176
04:37:14,710 --> 04:37:16,670
No naps will last.

4177
04:37:17,970 --> 04:37:22,570
I thought I could have nap time in between the third event.

4178
04:37:26,970 --> 04:37:27,370
It's okay.

4179
04:37:28,010 --> 04:37:30,170
Since it's okay, it's okay.

4180
04:37:31,610 --> 04:37:37,890
Eventually, if I keep telling myself it's okay, it will
eventually be okay.

4181
04:37:41,430 --> 04:37:41,950
Oh.

4182
04:38:09,730 --> 04:38:11,510
What kind of asking for, Ellie?

4183
04:38:14,450 --> 04:38:24,550

4185
04:38:36,450 --> 04:38:46,050
that's right i ordered him to swap the joke you feel it's
for the rest of this we gotta make sure we make it happen no

4186
04:38:46,050 --> 04:39:11,310

right you're so right guys okay ambit first spin i'm

4187
04:39:11,310 --> 04:39:19,610
considering that gotcha before the cafe please consider
thank you for this oh uh maybe by the time you wake up from

4188
04:39:19,610 --> 04:39:27,970
your snap i'd be on my third game are we going to be on one
of your back first was it star but by that time we'll have

4189
04:39:27,970 --> 04:39:38,350
our third game that's fair but yeah i think you just do star
lord or phoenix yeah i think so either i like the phoenix i

4190
04:39:38,350 --> 04:39:46,930
like the phoenix a lot low key yeah because like i don't
think the star lord is like that valuable if they're That's

4191
04:39:46,930 --> 04:39:47,990
being generous.

4192
04:39:48,310 --> 04:39:49,250
That's mostly what I play it for.

4193
04:39:49,470 --> 04:39:51,490
There is another game after this.

4194
04:39:51,870 --> 04:39:52,430
There is...

4195
04:39:52,430 --> 04:39:53,210
Do you guys want to ban it?

4196
04:39:53,390 --> 04:39:54,530
Rockets or Groot?

4197
04:39:55,350 --> 04:39:56,030
What would you rather ban?

4198
04:39:56,230 --> 04:39:57,130
I think Groot.

4199
04:39:57,770 --> 04:39:58,630
I think Groot also.

4200
04:39:58,930 --> 04:39:59,210
Yeah.

4201
04:39:59,210 --> 04:40:02,750
That's so exciting to think you'd have a third game in about
three hours.

4202
04:40:06,810 --> 04:40:11,250
Honestly, take a nap after this, wake up in four hours, and
then do your third game.

4203
04:40:11,510 --> 04:40:13,430
I don't have four hours.

4204
04:40:13,570 --> 04:40:14,430
Yeah, we get rid of Groot.

4205
04:40:14,670 --> 04:40:16,190
I have two hours left.

4206
04:40:16,390 --> 04:40:17,250
Let's talk about it.

4207
04:40:17,410 --> 04:40:17,990
You could do Loki.

4208
04:40:18,470 --> 04:40:20,390
They already protected so you can play Loki and Aura.

4209
04:40:20,950 --> 04:40:23,370
I literally have two hours left at this tournament.

4210
04:40:23,390 --> 04:40:24,490
I'm done with that.

4211
04:40:26,450 --> 04:40:27,290
Said Loki?

4212
04:40:28,770 --> 04:40:30,750
It's because like, I don't know.

4213
04:40:31,150 --> 04:40:36,050
They just wanted every match to be streamed, but it wasn't
even...

4214
04:40:36,050 --> 04:40:42,170
They just wanted every match to not go simultaneously so
that people will have to all focus their attention on one

4215
04:40:42,170 --> 04:40:44,210
stream while the matches are going on.

4216
04:40:44,550 --> 04:40:44,810
Sounds good.

4217
04:40:45,010 --> 04:40:45,590
I don't mind.

4218
04:40:47,230 --> 04:40:48,670
That's fine.

4219
04:40:53,100 --> 04:40:55,020
But then my match wasn't streamed.

4220
04:40:55,200 --> 04:40:56,540
That was the worst part.

4221
04:41:00,420 --> 04:41:01,240
For the numbers.

4222
04:41:01,580 --> 04:41:02,440
For the numbers.

4223
04:41:08,190 --> 04:41:08,690
Interesting.

4224
04:41:12,510 --> 04:41:14,050
That is very interesting.

4225
04:41:14,510 --> 04:41:15,430
Alright, Rocket it is.

4226
04:41:18,590 --> 04:41:26,610

wanted to just start yeah i was thinking i was trying to

4230
04:42:03,230 --> 04:42:10,970
yeah i'm thinking my hawkeye it up yeah just think of the
spider into hawkeye yeah think of the the fact that you got

4231
04:42:10,970 --> 04:42:18,250
to play spider-man here probably don't worry yeah maybe
bucky could also be a good option to stop it see i saw me

4232
04:42:18,250 --> 04:42:23,910
mute on you this is the spider-man map i was talking about
by the way i'm a sad character like don't worry at the

4233
04:42:23,910 --> 04:42:26,190
monopoly on the youtube stream of the rivals

4234
04:42:30,770 --> 04:42:37,730
sure i'm sorry if i'm complaining a lot about the tournament
but this is like i'm sorry but Let's fuck with me.

4235
04:42:37,890 --> 04:42:38,810
We can start left side.

4236
04:42:38,910 --> 04:42:39,830
I had a limit.

4237
04:42:40,090 --> 04:42:40,910
We shouldn't go to point committed.

4238
04:42:41,030 --> 04:42:41,950
It's already gone.

4239
04:42:45,970 --> 04:42:46,370
They're dipping.

4240
04:42:47,130 --> 04:42:47,270
Yeah.

4241
04:42:47,610 --> 04:42:48,170
We can break the walls.

4242
04:42:49,150 --> 04:42:52,430
I'm gonna push in three, two, one.

4243
04:42:52,590 --> 04:42:52,890
I'm gonna push in three, two, one.

4244
04:42:54,110 --> 04:42:54,970
Rogue is right here.

4245
04:42:55,490 --> 04:42:55,970
Rogue is stability.

4246
04:42:56,130 --> 04:42:56,950
Spider-Man's going in soon.

4247
04:42:58,050 --> 04:42:58,310
Turn.

4248
04:42:58,810 --> 04:43:00,950
I'm grabbing the rogue in three, two, one.

4249
04:43:01,210 --> 04:43:02,050
Grab and grope.

4250

4253
04:43:03,850 --> 04:43:04,110
Rogue one.

4254
04:43:06,130 --> 04:43:07,070
Rooks are one Rooks are one.

4255
04:43:07,850 --> 04:43:08,170
Rooks are one.

4256
04:43:08,170 --> 04:43:09,670
I'm on their strange one.

4257
04:43:09,890 --> 04:43:10,870
You're Spider-Man on us.

4258
04:43:11,490 --> 04:43:11,790
Strangest one.

4259
04:43:11,990 --> 04:43:12,230
Strangest one.

4260
04:43:12,370 --> 04:43:13,210
I'm gonna drop him.

4261
04:43:13,410 --> 04:43:14,590
Drop him play under with me.

You're good.

4267

Nice.

Good job.

4273
04:43:26,850 --> 04:43:27,250
Can you stop?

4274
04:43:27,330 --> 04:43:27,950
Can we push her together?

4275
04:43:28,590 --> 04:43:28,850
Yeah, yeah.

4276
04:43:28,970 --> 04:43:29,510

Be proud of what you did here.

4279
04:43:31,590 --> 04:43:32,970
I'm behind her side.

4280
04:43:33,390 --> 04:43:34,390
I'm opening up this map.

4281
04:43:34,490 --> 04:43:34,950
Yeah, babe.

4282
04:43:35,170 --> 04:43:36,170
Shield to kill her.

4283
04:43:36,170 --> 04:43:36,570
Oh, he's one.

4284
04:43:36,770 --> 04:43:37,350
I don't think we chased them.

4285
04:43:37,530 --> 04:43:38,050
Last time.

4286
04:43:38,190 --> 04:43:38,470
I'm sorry.

4287
04:43:38,570 --> 04:43:39,290
They're playing full dive.

4288
04:43:39,450 --> 04:43:40,610
He's going to flank with Phoenix stun.

4289
04:43:41,430 --> 04:43:41,810
Yeah, yeah.

4290
04:43:41,870 --> 04:43:42,610
So check this out.

04:43:42,850 --> 04:43:43,510
Screw the left side.

4292
04:43:43,790 --> 04:43:45,610
The Spider-Man's going to come from there too, maybe.

4293
04:43:45,770 --> 04:43:47,570
Okay, I'll just play further back with you guys.

4294
04:43:47,930 --> 04:43:48,030
Yeah.

4295
04:43:48,270 --> 04:43:48,850
Yeah, they're probably all going.

4296
04:43:48,930 --> 04:43:49,390
They're probably all going.

4297
04:43:49,490 --> 04:43:50,430
I'm going to meet them.

4298
04:43:50,510 --> 04:43:50,950

We can die.

4443
04:47:00,930 --> 04:47:01,090
Rock and die.

4444
04:47:01,310 --> 04:47:01,710
Rock and die.

4446
04:47:02,930 --> 04:47:04,990
I have to die there.

4447
04:47:05,290 --> 04:47:05,570

4448
04:47:05,610 --> 04:47:05,950

04:47:17,390 --> 04:47:18,030
We can hit him.

4460
04:47:18,550 --> 04:47:19,330
He's like a fly.

4461
04:47:19,690 --> 04:47:20,270
I pulled him.

4462
04:47:20,270 --> 04:47:20,710

4463
04:47:20,930 --> 04:47:21,730

4464
04:47:21,950 --> 04:47:22,490
Starlord behind one HP.

4465
04:47:23,070 --> 04:47:23,670
He's still one.

4466
04:47:24,210 --> 04:47:24,470
Nice.

4467
04:47:25,670 --> 04:47:26,190
Good stuff.

4468
04:47:26,650 --> 04:47:27,490
They use Spider at the end.

4469
04:47:27,490 --> 04:47:32,690
They're gonna have cap star Luna, cap star Luna.

4470
04:47:32,890 --> 04:47:34,490
Okay, I can go cap in my ult maybe.

4471
04:47:35,970 --> 04:47:36,410
Okay.

4472
04:47:37,250 --> 04:47:39,630
I think I need to...

4473
04:47:39,630 --> 04:47:41,290
I need to copy Luna here.

4474
04:47:42,030 --> 04:47:43,930
I mean, team captain can combo to kill the supports.

4475
04:47:44,550 --> 04:47:44,950
Yeah, Luna.

4476
04:47:45,390 --> 04:47:46,830
You can play...

4477
04:47:46,830 --> 04:47:48,830
Yeah, you can play it safe, Arra.

4478
04:47:48,890 --> 04:47:50,850
We have... we have Mago too, for pure.

4479
04:47:51,750 --> 04:47:52,010
Yeah.

4480
04:47:53,230 --> 04:47:53,670
Okay.

4481
04:47:53,910 --> 04:47:54,250
Okay.

4482
04:47:54,550 --> 04:47:56,230
I don't use our ult every time, don't worry.

4483
04:47:58,930 --> 04:47:59,650
It's okay.

4484
04:48:00,010 --> 04:48:01,490
It don't happen to have any superpowers.

4485
04:48:02,310 --> 04:48:03,410
Why is everyone diving?

4486
04:48:04,990 --> 04:48:06,770
I'm glad you're safe.

4487
04:48:06,910 --> 04:48:08,130
I just want to nod at the couple.

4488
04:48:08,470 --> 04:48:09,690
So I'm just gonna use my open grabbing.

4489
04:48:09,710 --> 04:48:11,090
It's just dive, dive, dive.

4490
04:48:11,190 --> 04:48:11,870
Yeah, I like that.

4491
04:48:14,570 --> 04:48:15,470
They don't have TP.

4492
04:48:15,930 --> 04:48:18,690
We could also TP on top of them if we really wanted to.

4493
04:48:19,610 --> 04:48:20,690
Nah, I think we played safe.

4494
04:48:21,650 --> 04:48:22,690
I think we played safe.

4495
04:48:22,690 --> 04:48:23,930
I think we played safe, to be honest.

4496
04:48:24,390 --> 04:48:26,310
It would be, it would be girl who could be, but yeah.

4497
04:48:27,910 --> 04:48:32,750
I can go through mid.

4498
04:48:33,110 --> 04:48:34,730
I'll look for Spidey if I see.

4499
04:48:34,890 --> 04:48:35,130
Mm-hmm.

4500
04:48:35,330 --> 04:48:36,350
Watch pull from right side.

4501
04:48:36,910 --> 04:48:37,890
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

4502
04:48:38,130 --> 04:48:38,570
Path left.

4503
04:48:38,810 --> 04:48:39,230
Oh, he's right side.

4504
04:48:39,250 --> 04:48:39,710
He has right side.

4505
04:48:39,750 --> 04:48:40,150
He has right side.

4506
04:48:40,290 --> 04:48:40,630
He's in the door.

4507
04:48:40,830 --> 04:48:41,350
Yeah, he's looking.

4508
04:48:41,990 --> 04:48:43,730
I was going behind with all.

4509
04:48:44,030 --> 04:48:44,570
I need to play behind.

4510
04:48:44,570 --> 04:48:45,110
They don't have Luna anymore.

4511
04:48:45,350 --> 04:48:45,890
Honus now.

4512
04:48:46,590 --> 04:48:46,910
Honus.

4513
04:48:47,250 --> 04:48:48,490
Oh, I am.

4514
04:48:48,710 --> 04:48:49,290
We can walk.

4515
04:48:49,370 --> 04:48:50,290
Walk the point.

4516
04:48:50,370 --> 04:48:50,710
Walk the point.

4517
04:48:50,870 --> 04:48:51,170
Walk the point.

4518
04:48:53,050 --> 04:48:53,870
I pulled Luna.

4519
04:48:53,950 --> 04:48:54,190
I pulled Luna.

4520
04:48:54,570 --> 04:48:55,630
Oh, it's Mantis.

4521
04:48:56,490 --> 04:48:56,730
Yeah.

4522
04:48:59,530 --> 04:48:59,970
Nice.

4523
04:49:00,790 --> 04:49:01,470
I'm looking Cap.

4524
04:49:01,730 --> 04:49:01,990
I am looking Cap.

4525
04:49:02,690 --> 04:49:04,450
Cap is on Cap.

4526
04:49:05,870 --> 04:49:06,130
Cap's old.

4527
04:49:07,090 --> 04:49:07,530
I'm strong.

4528
04:49:08,590 --> 04:49:09,710
Don't have him.

4529
04:49:10,310 --> 04:49:11,110
I'm shooting Star Wars.

4530
04:49:11,350 --> 04:49:12,530
I have two people on me.

4531
04:49:13,570 --> 04:49:13,970
I'm watching you.

4532
04:49:13,990 --> 04:49:14,370
I'm watching you.

4533
04:49:14,370 --> 04:49:15,130
I'm in one second.

4534
04:49:16,110 --> 04:49:18,690
You can he play under with me?

4535
04:49:18,790 --> 04:49:19,650
Yeah, I'm right.

4536
04:49:20,050 --> 04:49:20,730
He's in there.

4537
04:49:22,550 --> 04:49:23,290
I'm gonna go.

4538
04:49:23,470 --> 04:49:24,090
He's one.

4539
04:49:24,210 --> 04:49:24,350
He's one.

4540
04:49:24,470 --> 04:49:24,610
He's one.

4541
04:49:25,670 --> 04:49:26,790
I can still die.

4542
04:49:27,350 --> 04:49:27,970
That's Mensis hold.

4543
04:49:29,530 --> 04:49:30,550
Oh, you're that under.

4544
04:49:30,730 --> 04:49:30,910
Oh, sorry.

4545
04:49:31,110 --> 04:49:31,830
I want to kill this side.

4546
04:49:31,850 --> 04:49:33,530
I think I'm going to use...

4547
04:49:36,130 --> 04:49:36,270
Hmm.

4548
04:49:36,750 --> 04:49:38,450
I can't get volleyed from him.

4549
04:49:38,970 --> 04:49:39,630
The other couple.

4550
04:49:39,830 --> 04:49:40,190
Yeah, my bad.

4551
04:49:40,430 --> 04:49:41,430
I regret so on.

4552
04:49:41,670 --> 04:49:42,350
It's just tragic.

4553
04:49:46,910 --> 04:49:46,970
I won't.

4554
04:49:46,970 --> 04:49:48,310
They're gonna have Spider-Man.

4555
04:49:49,570 --> 04:49:50,010
Mantis only?

4556
04:49:51,130 --> 04:49:51,710
No, they're gonna have Spider-Man.

4557
04:49:51,710 --> 04:49:51,790

No worries.

4664
04:53:12,990 --> 04:53:13,470
It's all good.

4665
04:53:16,090 --> 04:53:18,350
I think with this...

4666
04:53:19,470 --> 04:53:20,250
I don't know.

4667
04:53:20,510 --> 04:53:21,250
It's like...

4668
04:53:21,250 --> 04:53:22,090
Obviously, they're playing.

4669
04:53:22,270 --> 04:53:22,830
It's like hard.

4670
04:53:22,910 --> 04:53:23,790
Fuck our backline.

4671
04:53:24,330 --> 04:53:25,190
But you just go Bucky.

4672
04:53:27,390 --> 04:53:28,770
You want it to?

4673
04:53:29,050 --> 04:53:29,490
Yeah.

4674
04:53:29,910 --> 04:53:30,570
I'll try it.

4675
04:53:31,070 --> 04:53:32,390
I actually don't know.

4676
04:53:34,730 --> 04:53:36,130
Okay, I'm going to go captain America.

4677
04:53:36,370 --> 04:53:41,990
I kind of want to do what they're doing and just play to
like not really have a backline, right?

4678
04:53:43,570 --> 04:53:43,990
Like...

4679
04:53:43,990 --> 04:53:44,970
Let's do this.

4680
04:53:48,790 --> 04:53:51,050
Sparman's going to play for Othma and Pooks like 24-17.

4681
04:53:52,970 --> 04:53:53,230
Yeah.

4682
04:53:53,410 --> 04:53:53,510
Yeah.

4683
04:53:53,510 --> 04:53:53,690
Okay, okay.

4684
04:53:53,790 --> 04:53:54,850
We just play together.

4685
04:53:56,410 --> 04:53:58,430
It's way harder for them, I think.

4686
04:53:59,150 --> 04:53:59,290
Yeah.

4687
04:54:02,670 --> 04:54:04,210
We're not allowed to go triple, right?

4688
04:54:04,890 --> 04:54:06,090
No, you can't.

4689
04:54:06,210 --> 04:54:07,610
Oh, no triple support.

4690
04:54:07,830 --> 04:54:09,470
They actually add triple support.

4691
04:54:09,630 --> 04:54:11,410
What the fuck counters that?

4692
04:54:11,750 --> 04:54:11,870
Yeah.

4693
04:54:12,990 --> 04:54:14,310
This is just a normal Tuesday.

4694
04:54:14,330 --> 04:54:15,190
I'll make my ult faster.

4695
04:54:17,390 --> 04:54:18,130
They have Spadio, right?

4696
04:54:18,370 --> 04:54:19,090
I'll try to set my guard.

4697
04:54:20,470 --> 04:54:21,010
They're going close.

4698
04:54:21,730 --> 04:54:22,050
I land.

4699
04:54:22,470 --> 04:54:23,210
I'm really close to my ult.

4700
04:54:25,150 --> 04:54:25,710
I'm grabbing.

4701
04:54:25,970 --> 04:54:26,290
Oh, well.

4702
04:54:26,770 --> 04:54:27,210
Look at Rogue.

4703
04:54:27,830 --> 04:54:28,470
Rogue is Spadio.

4704
04:54:29,090 --> 04:54:29,330
Rogue is one.

4705
04:54:29,510 --> 04:54:29,630
Rogue is one.

4706
04:54:29,890 --> 04:54:29,910
Rogue is one.

4707
04:54:30,850 --> 04:54:31,890
My ult's over in three.

4708
04:54:32,250 --> 04:54:32,810
Play out of it.

4709
04:54:32,950 --> 04:54:33,390
I don't have all.

4710
04:54:33,810 --> 04:54:34,330
Yeah, you just have the chip.

4711
04:54:34,350 --> 04:54:35,690
I don't have a lot yet.

4712
04:54:35,830 --> 04:54:36,110
88.

4713
04:54:36,510 --> 04:54:37,730
I go black one after all.

4714
04:54:38,130 --> 04:54:38,550
Yeah, yeah.

4715
04:54:39,510 --> 04:54:40,270
We should touch point.

4716
04:54:40,550 --> 04:54:40,850
We can.

4717
04:54:41,370 --> 04:54:43,050
I can touch after you.

4718
04:54:43,190 --> 04:54:43,970
I can touch after you.

4719
04:54:44,050 --> 04:54:44,310
I can touch after you.

4720
04:54:44,310 --> 04:54:44,610
I can't see you.

4721
04:54:45,050 --> 04:54:45,370
Cap is low.

4722
04:54:45,470 --> 04:54:45,610
I got out.

4723
04:54:46,230 --> 04:54:46,630
I need care.

4724
04:54:47,150 --> 04:54:47,570
I need care.

4725
04:54:48,410 --> 04:54:48,890
I need care.

4726
04:54:49,290 --> 04:54:50,090

05:00:34,570 --> 05:00:47,090
my bad it's okay oh perfecto maybe deadpool i need to be
down or die it's just my bad maybe in maybe deadpool would

4920
05:00:47,090 --> 05:00:53,790
be yeah i waited three hours for this i waited three hours
to play against dive

4921
05:00:57,070 --> 05:01:07,180
i'm not talking much because i don't need a talk i literally
just have to exist yeah they know now that the spider-man's

4922
05:01:07,180 --> 05:01:14,540
valuable so they're probably gonna protect it first yeah the
dps copy was intelligent doing that but i actually saved it

4923
05:01:14,540 --> 05:01:24,400
wrong wrong alt uh who did they protect last time it was alt
tracking just protected invis first the alt tracking yep

4924
05:01:24,400 --> 05:01:32,630
which is good for us i think yeah like i had to up there
yeah they're protecting spider-man

4925
05:01:44,830 --> 05:01:57,120
second you see we got in midtown we just own these guys in
midtown they want to stay they love sponholding so i don't

4926
05:01:57,120 --> 05:02:02,700
know if you want to go sponhold map but it's up to you we
can do it back to if you want you can only play through

4927
05:02:02,700 --> 05:02:06,340
support yeah yeah Yeah, I don't think Spinal will be too
good.

4928
05:02:06,460 --> 05:02:07,400
Yeah, I think we do Midtown.

4929
05:02:08,200 --> 05:02:08,600
Everyone agree?

4930
05:02:09,700 --> 05:02:10,200
Yeah, I'm done.

4931
05:02:10,340 --> 05:02:11,320
I think we are better on Midtown.

4932
05:02:11,380 --> 05:02:11,720
Oh, I'm good.

4933
05:02:12,780 --> 05:02:13,420
All right.

4934
05:02:15,120 --> 05:02:17,520
No, they're pressuring me too much, bro.

4935
05:02:18,480 --> 05:02:20,140
Yeah, yeah, he will just come with me.

4936
05:02:20,200 --> 05:02:23,100
I was watching their other map where they were spawn
holding.

4937
05:02:23,180 --> 05:02:24,860
They were spawn holding with, like, Penny, Rocket, Moon
Knight.

4938
05:02:25,520 --> 05:02:27,440
If they do that, I think we just play Torch Ultron.

4939
05:02:29,780 --> 05:02:30,100
Yeah.

4940
05:02:30,760 --> 05:02:31,080
Could.

4941
05:02:31,540 --> 05:02:32,560
Do you think I was playing Ultron?

4942
05:02:33,180 --> 05:02:33,800
I would be playing this.

4943
05:02:34,760 --> 05:02:42,600
i have to be super hyper focused too because like well we
can't trip i have to do back and forth really hard we can

4944
05:02:42,600 --> 05:02:49,620
play it's like i have to look in the front for my tank and i
can look behind my loki i can punish oh it's really hard

4945
05:02:49,620 --> 05:02:56,900
doing the the back and forth i think i think it's first span
spidey like loki has to be behind me the loki is behind me

4946
05:02:56,900 --> 05:03:03,840
and and then i play in front of my loki you can probably
leave hella open if you want so i don't know if you're

4947
05:03:03,840 --> 05:03:11,760
comfortable with I'm fine with leaving it open honestly And
if he's gonna play midnight I can just ban that too Honestly

4948
05:03:11,760 --> 05:03:18,840
No I don't want to ban midnight I have to be constantly
aware of the back I feel like we can We could not ban rocket

4949
05:03:18,840 --> 05:03:25,280
if you want But the moment I turn around Like my front line
guys I just ban something else Do you want to change

4950
05:03:25,280 --> 05:03:25,860
anything up?

4951
05:03:27,080 --> 05:03:38,260
I think Why do we have to Why did we play it Both Spider-Man
players Back to back Protect how this is yeah i don't know i

4952
05:03:38,260 --> 05:03:43,800
think we probably just ban that guy's rocket i think there's
supports for like yeah they can't play hila no more as well

4953
05:03:43,800 --> 05:03:50,140
i feel like if you if you proc fucking or they proc hila you
can proc no more they can't play it yeah real true

4954
05:03:50,140 --> 05:03:59,560
interesting okay yeah i think cal no more is actually cheat
code to being this team too yeah yeah i can pop up i can

4955
05:03:59,560 --> 05:03:59,840
hang up

4956
05:04:03,420 --> 05:04:14,460
and then i have to fucking and then they can my ult too
which sucks because i got my ult forced out like twice too

4957
05:04:20,240 --> 05:04:32,120
i was so surprised we didn't find spider-man because like
day spider-man is scarier than uh it's scarier than zeal's

4958
05:04:32,120 --> 05:04:44,020
spider-man i'm so out of it i'm so out of it right now

4959
05:04:49,480 --> 05:04:52,200
Oh, no, my God.

4960
05:04:53,940 --> 05:04:56,420
We're at the five-hour mark.

4961
05:04:58,380 --> 05:04:59,640
I, like, lose my...

4962
05:04:59,640 --> 05:05:00,620
Like, I lose my...

4963
05:05:00,620 --> 05:05:01,920
The momentum, too.

4964
05:05:21,910 --> 05:05:24,010
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

4965
05:05:26,730 --> 05:05:27,630
Okay, defense first.

4966
05:05:32,530 --> 05:05:34,650
I'm disassociating for a bit.

4967
05:05:36,410 --> 05:05:39,330
Oh, I should have played Hades.

4968
05:05:39,350 --> 05:05:55,690
in between yes if I played Hades in between maybe there was
a chance that was much which one do we want that was where I

4969
05:05:55,690 --> 05:06:03,370
fucked up I don't know it doesn't really matter for us to be
honest like I feel like we can do like anything we want

4970
05:06:03,370 --> 05:06:09,810
you're just a Loki again or a tank or a DPS I know no more
maybe I like Loki.

4971
05:06:12,330 --> 05:06:17,990
I think if anything, it would just be like one of your other
DPSs that you would like to have open and maybe like, I

4972
05:06:17,990 --> 05:06:23,210
don't know if a tank is even good to be honest, I don't even
think they would ban tanks, but yeah.

4973
05:06:25,190 --> 05:06:27,570
Probably just DPS or Loki.

4974
05:06:27,650 --> 05:06:28,410
Are we defense first?

4975
05:06:29,170 --> 05:06:29,490
Yeah, we are.

4976
05:06:30,030 --> 05:06:30,290
Yeah.

4977
05:06:32,870 --> 05:06:34,690
We've been rocket second, I think, again.

4978
05:06:37,350 --> 05:06:38,590
Isn't good insane at this point?

4979
05:06:39,350 --> 05:06:40,430
Phoenix, I'm banning Rocket.

4980
05:06:41,270 --> 05:06:42,350
Or, yeah, Groot is good.

4981
05:06:43,130 --> 05:06:43,810
It's Rocket or Groot?

4982
05:06:44,030 --> 05:06:44,190
What do you think?

4983
05:06:44,270 --> 05:06:44,570
No, no.

4984
05:06:44,970 --> 05:06:45,630
Ban Groot.

4985
05:06:45,990 --> 05:06:49,370
I actually like the option for us to play in Rocket as well.

4986
05:06:50,410 --> 05:06:50,610
Okay.

4987
05:06:51,370 --> 05:06:51,770
Sorry.

4988
05:06:53,290 --> 05:06:55,090
I can protect Amore here.

4989
05:06:57,170 --> 05:06:57,490
Yeah.

4990
05:06:57,930 --> 05:06:58,210
Yeah.

4991
05:06:58,870 --> 05:06:59,270
Okay.

4992
05:06:59,350 --> 05:06:59,930
I think you do.

4993
05:07:00,030 --> 05:07:02,390
And then if they want to ban Hella no more, they have to ban
their own Hella.

4994
05:07:03,370 --> 05:07:03,630
Sure.

4995
05:07:16,870 --> 05:07:19,490
And then for third ban...

4996
05:07:20,510 --> 05:07:21,710
Quite a lot we can do.

4997
05:07:23,930 --> 05:07:27,050
Oh, said we want our rocket open.

4998
05:07:27,310 --> 05:07:28,710
I could just ban...

4999
05:07:28,710 --> 05:07:29,690
Okay, the protective midnight.

5000
05:07:29,910 --> 05:07:30,250
I figured.

5001
05:07:31,530 --> 05:07:33,910
I'm partial to a penny, Ben, if we want.

5002
05:07:34,910 --> 05:07:35,910
I'm down for that.

5003
05:07:36,770 --> 05:07:37,230
I'm also down.

5004
05:07:37,230 --> 05:07:37,990
I'm actually...

5005
05:07:37,990 --> 05:07:39,490
Penny is actually really good.

5006
05:07:40,230 --> 05:07:40,970
Yeah, I'm down.

5007
05:07:41,210 --> 05:07:41,530
Probably rogue.

5008
05:07:41,890 --> 05:07:42,830
So it's going to hit the rogue.

5009
05:07:43,190 --> 05:07:44,190
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

5010
05:07:45,910 --> 05:07:46,690
I'll ban penny, though.

5011
05:07:50,910 --> 05:07:51,310
Okay, nice.

5012
05:07:51,330 --> 05:07:52,350

5085
05:10:45,950 --> 05:10:46,270
There's that.

5086
05:10:46,930 --> 05:10:47,730
There's the TKs are behind us.

5087
05:10:47,750 --> 05:10:48,030
He was blind.

5088
05:10:48,850 --> 05:10:49,470
I got pulled.

5089
05:10:49,590 --> 05:10:49,870
I got pulled.

5090
05:10:49,870 --> 05:10:50,930
I got my neckline.

5091
05:10:51,030 --> 05:10:51,590
They're okay.

5092
05:10:51,790 --> 05:10:51,990
I thought.

5093
05:10:53,310 --> 05:10:54,650
Yeah, the DPS was behind us.

5094
05:10:56,410 --> 05:10:56,670
I'm living.

5095
05:10:57,770 --> 05:10:58,810
And I can legit live.

5096
05:10:59,550 --> 05:10:59,670
We kill road friends.

5097
05:11:00,590 --> 05:11:00,970
Oh, I'm on HP.

5098
05:11:01,090 --> 05:11:01,370
I'm on HP.

5099
05:11:01,790 --> 05:11:02,350
Just chill, chill, chill.

5100
05:11:03,090 --> 05:11:03,890
They're gonna bash.

5101
05:11:04,390 --> 05:11:04,990
We can walk my own.

5102
05:11:05,050 --> 05:11:05,290
It's okay.

5103
05:11:05,370 --> 05:11:05,530
It's okay.

5104
05:11:05,610 --> 05:11:06,230
They put it in the water.

5105
05:11:08,930 --> 05:11:09,650
I died.

5106
05:11:12,710 --> 05:11:13,430
I'm behind.

5107
05:11:15,470 --> 05:11:15,830
Oh hell.

5108
05:11:16,770 --> 05:11:17,350
I got a kill.

5109
05:11:18,710 --> 05:11:19,350
We have punish roll.

5110
05:11:19,630 --> 05:11:19,850
We have punish roll.

5111
05:11:19,850 --> 05:11:21,430
Besides one, she lives.

5112
05:11:21,690 --> 05:11:23,830
We could probably just wait for a rock at all here.

5113
05:11:24,610 --> 05:11:25,830
They have Moon Knight or again.

5114
05:11:26,130 --> 05:11:27,870
Yes, but I'm in a bad spot, okay?

5115
05:11:29,070 --> 05:11:29,270
Okay.

5116
05:11:29,470 --> 05:11:29,990
Are you...

5117
05:11:30,670 --> 05:11:32,430
Yeah, I can touch maybe.

5118
05:11:32,650 --> 05:11:33,090
Yeah, I can touch.

5119
05:11:33,210 --> 05:11:33,490
I can touch.

5120
05:11:33,610 --> 05:11:34,010
I'll be touched.

5121
05:11:34,390 --> 05:11:35,430
3, 2, 1.

5122
05:11:35,670 --> 05:11:35,750
I'm touching.

5123
05:11:36,870 --> 05:11:37,990
Look at the rogue.

5124
05:11:38,110 --> 05:11:38,590
The rogue is in.

5125
05:11:38,730 --> 05:11:39,630
The rogue is in.

5126
05:11:39,630 --> 05:11:41,170
I'm trying to help her punish her right now.

5127
05:11:41,970 --> 05:11:42,650
Anika, Anika.

5128
05:11:42,810 --> 05:11:43,090
Where are you?

5129
05:11:43,390 --> 05:11:45,350
I want the pillar.

5130
05:11:45,710 --> 05:11:45,710
I want the pillar.

5131
05:11:45,710 --> 05:11:46,070
I want the pillar.

5132
05:11:46,610 --> 05:11:47,230
I want to see you.

5133
05:11:49,910 --> 05:11:50,850
I want Munda in.

5134
05:11:53,390 --> 05:11:54,550
Ruh, Munda, Munda won a point.

5135
05:11:55,330 --> 05:11:57,970
I have to reload.

5136
05:11:58,710 --> 05:11:59,150
I have to reload.

5137
05:12:00,310 --> 05:12:00,770
I'm dead here.

5138
05:12:00,890 --> 05:12:01,110
I'm dead.

5139
05:12:01,370 --> 05:12:01,490
I'm dead.

5140
05:12:01,910 --> 05:12:02,010
I'm dead.

5141
05:12:02,010 --> 05:12:03,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5142
05:12:03,410 --> 05:12:03,910
Touch, touch, touch.

5143
05:12:03,930 --> 05:12:04,670
I'm TP, I'm TP.

5144
05:12:07,130 --> 05:12:07,990
She's half, she's half, she's half.

5145
05:12:08,130 --> 05:12:09,070
She's low, she's low, she's low.

5146
05:12:09,970 --> 05:12:10,290
I'm sorry.

5147
05:12:11,350 --> 05:12:11,970
She's full HP now.

5148
05:12:12,130 --> 05:12:12,430
I'm done.

5149
05:12:14,430 --> 05:12:15,490
Lead, back in spawn.

5150
05:12:16,370 --> 05:12:17,030
I'm almost back.

5151
05:12:17,110 --> 05:12:17,490
I'm almost back.

5152
05:12:18,490 --> 05:12:19,110
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through.

5153
05:12:19,230 --> 05:12:19,730
I'm done, I'm done.

5154
05:12:19,850 --> 05:12:20,830
I got siloed.

5155
05:12:20,990 --> 05:12:21,450
Siloed can die.

5156
05:12:21,550 --> 05:12:22,570
Oh, I got hit by that.

5157
05:12:22,790 --> 05:12:22,970
Siloed one.

5158
05:12:23,150 --> 05:12:24,490
Siloed one.

5159
05:12:25,150 --> 05:12:25,470
Dead.

5160
05:12:28,790 --> 05:12:30,390
I think we need to try and kill them on this more.

5161
05:12:30,530 --> 05:12:31,370
She's just taking angles.

5162
05:12:32,030 --> 05:12:32,570
Yeah, I agree.

5163
05:12:33,410 --> 05:12:34,870
You guys are already probably dash on that.

5164
05:12:35,910 --> 05:12:36,530
Do it now.

5165
05:12:37,850 --> 05:12:38,170
Okay.

5166
05:12:38,770 --> 05:12:39,890
They use both tank.

5167
05:12:40,850 --> 05:12:41,170
Sigh.

5168
05:12:41,910 --> 05:12:44,410
They're gonna have Moon Knight and both support, I think.

5169
05:12:45,970 --> 05:12:47,270
Okay, I can probably even my ult.

5170
05:12:47,550 --> 05:12:48,810
We can go fast off of that, maybe.

5171
05:12:49,110 --> 05:12:50,710
If they go fast, we can just sky with our spoo.

5172
05:12:50,790 --> 05:12:51,490
We can push them back.

5173
05:12:51,510 --> 05:12:53,430
and I can stop right.

5174
05:12:53,570 --> 05:12:54,290
Sai is on the left.

5175
05:12:54,910 --> 05:12:55,630
I'm going to walk main.

5176
05:12:55,930 --> 05:12:56,570
I'm walking main.

5177
05:12:56,710 --> 05:12:57,910
Three, two, one.

5178
05:12:58,970 --> 05:12:59,490
I got the room.

5179
05:12:59,990 --> 05:13:00,690
Come out.

5180
05:13:00,810 --> 05:13:01,750
I'm trying to.

5181
05:13:02,570 --> 05:13:03,050
I'm all three.

5182
05:13:03,250 --> 05:13:03,390
We have better.

5183
05:13:03,430 --> 05:13:04,070
I'm backing.

5184
05:13:04,830 --> 05:13:05,290
I'm going point.

5185
05:13:05,410 --> 05:13:05,750
I'm going point.

5186
05:13:12,730 --> 05:13:13,850
They're all turning back for me.

5187
05:13:14,750 --> 05:13:15,550
Yeah, we're trying to.

5188
05:13:15,550 --> 05:13:16,030
I'm just going to die point.

5189
05:13:16,510 --> 05:13:17,930
Yeah, just like, I'll die point too.

5190
05:13:21,330 --> 05:13:22,750
Don't be afraid to lag.

5191
05:13:23,530 --> 05:13:25,850
their old as soon as they use something like that.

5192
05:13:31,730 --> 05:13:32,050
Um...

5193
05:13:32,050 --> 05:13:32,710
I don't know if they use that.

5194
05:13:32,710 --> 05:13:33,450
You just have to go first.

5195
05:13:34,770 --> 05:13:35,850
They use, uh...

5196
05:13:36,370 --> 05:13:37,230
Sue and Monet.

5197
05:13:37,550 --> 05:13:38,610
They'll have a lot.

5198
05:13:39,110 --> 05:13:40,330
I can walk with our, uh...

5199
05:13:40,330 --> 05:13:40,830
I can walk with our, uh...

5200
05:13:40,830 --> 05:13:41,310
I'm using my own.

5201
05:13:41,410 --> 05:13:41,910
I'm using my own.

5202
05:13:42,090 --> 05:13:43,390
Three, two, one.

5203
05:13:45,050 --> 05:13:45,710
Matus, Matus.

5204
05:13:45,850 --> 05:13:46,450
She's running, wait, wait, wait, one!

5205
05:13:46,850 --> 05:13:48,070
I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching.

5206
05:13:48,610 --> 05:13:49,390
I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching.

5207
05:13:49,610 --> 05:13:49,870
I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching.

5208
05:13:49,870 --> 05:13:50,310
I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching.

5209
05:13:50,910 --> 05:13:51,430
I should be fair.

5210
05:13:51,450 --> 05:13:52,230
I can walk up for this.

5211
05:13:52,330 --> 05:13:52,890
Go rogue, go rogue.

5212
05:13:53,350 --> 05:13:53,630
One.

5213
05:13:54,030 --> 05:13:54,570
I'm one.

5214
05:13:54,650 --> 05:13:55,190
I'm one too.

5215
05:13:55,210 --> 05:13:56,070
Help me with the backline.

5216
05:13:56,490 --> 05:13:57,250
I don't have shield.

5217
05:13:58,190 --> 05:13:58,610
I don't have bubble.

5218
05:13:59,210 --> 05:14:00,150
Stay on, stay on, stay on.

5219
05:14:00,890 --> 05:14:01,330
I'm good.

5220
05:14:01,330 --> 05:14:01,810
I'm good.

5221
05:14:02,050 --> 05:14:02,350
I'm good.

5222
05:14:04,050 --> 05:14:04,630
I'm a MLA.

5223
05:14:05,150 --> 05:14:05,450
Emma dies.

5224
05:14:05,750 --> 05:14:05,850
Nice.

5225
05:14:05,970 --> 05:14:06,270
Good job.

5226
05:14:06,430 --> 05:14:06,830
Nice, nice.

5227
05:14:06,990 --> 05:14:07,190
Good job.

5228
05:14:09,270 --> 05:14:10,910
Okay, that was Sai Moon Knight.

5229
05:14:11,630 --> 05:14:12,630
They have both handcuffs.

5230
05:14:13,490 --> 05:14:14,270
They use Rope.

5231
05:14:15,410 --> 05:14:16,090
Okay, okay.

5232
05:14:18,650 --> 05:14:20,350
I'm a Moon Knight and...

5233
05:14:21,470 --> 05:14:22,910
I'll use my GoPro ammo.

5234
05:14:23,350 --> 05:14:24,290
Someone behind.

5235
05:14:24,770 --> 05:14:25,770
It's the silot, I think.

5236
05:14:25,830 --> 05:14:26,790
Siler, siler, yeah.

5237
05:14:26,910 --> 05:14:27,070
Yeah, she's here.

05:14:27,170 --> 05:14:27,890
She's over there.

5239
05:14:28,050 --> 05:14:28,350
Bottom right.

5240
05:14:29,770 --> 05:14:30,550
I can come with you, girl.

5241
05:14:30,630 --> 05:14:30,930
She peeks.

5242
05:14:30,970 --> 05:14:32,890
Hey, I'm gonna wait here on this corner when they push.

5243
05:14:33,270 --> 05:14:34,270
Yeah, we need to stop them.

5244
05:14:34,610 --> 05:14:35,330
Yeah, hold them close.

I'm gonna grab the rogue.

5248
05:14:37,630 --> 05:14:38,270
Hey, Babelby, Babel.

5249
05:14:39,490 --> 05:14:40,130
I'm pulling him in.

5250
05:14:40,250 --> 05:14:40,590
I'm pulling him in.

5251
05:14:41,710 --> 05:14:42,290
Are you guys chilling?

5257
05:14:46,530 --> 05:14:47,330
I hope corner, I hope corner.

5258
05:14:49,370 --> 05:14:49,970
It's about their kite.

5259
05:14:50,010 --> 05:14:50,330
They're done.

5260
05:14:50,330 --> 05:14:51,790
Okay, i'm 87.

5261
05:14:52,170 --> 05:14:52,990
We can walk a little bit.

5262
05:14:53,070 --> 05:14:53,930
We can walk a little bit.

5263
05:14:54,370 --> 05:14:54,810
Just poke them.

5264
05:14:54,930 --> 05:14:55,010
Pop them.

Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue.

5381
05:17:56,010 --> 05:17:56,910

I can absorb after.

5387
05:18:03,270 --> 05:18:05,130
Three, two, one.

5388
05:18:05,270 --> 05:18:06,410
I got Rogue.

5389
05:18:06,590 --> 05:18:07,730
How do you explain this, guys?

5390
05:18:08,350 --> 05:18:08,890
I'm locking back.

5391
05:18:09,090 --> 05:18:09,770
I'm locking back in three.

5392
05:18:12,570 --> 05:18:13,010
I got two.

5393
05:18:13,190 --> 05:18:13,570
Rogue one.

5394
05:18:14,610 --> 05:18:14,870
What one?

5395
05:18:14,970 --> 05:18:15,210
What one?

5396
05:18:15,430 --> 05:18:15,630
CURME.

5397
05:18:15,990 --> 05:18:16,210
CURME main.

5398
05:18:16,430 --> 05:18:16,770
CURME main, main, main.

5399
05:18:17,550 --> 05:18:19,270
Look at MMI, MMI, MMI.

5400
05:18:19,470 --> 05:18:20,130
MMI, MMI, MMI.

5401
05:18:20,450 --> 05:18:21,030
They have no supports.

5402
05:18:21,490 --> 05:18:21,810
They have no supports.

5403
05:18:21,810 --> 05:18:22,490
Start, start, start.

5404
05:18:22,670 --> 05:18:22,890
He's gone.

5405
05:18:22,970 --> 05:18:23,350
He's gone.

5406
05:18:23,390 --> 05:18:23,710
Okay.

5407
05:18:23,710 --> 05:18:23,750
Nice.

5408
05:18:28,110 --> 05:18:32,270
Okay, if we're going to play this comp, we just need to talk
about our dives like a lot more and we'll just win

5409
05:18:32,270 --> 05:18:32,770
automatically.

5410
05:18:33,370 --> 05:18:35,190
They have like such a weak back-line to avoid our hits.

5411
05:18:35,730 --> 05:18:36,590
Yeah, I think so too.

5412
05:18:36,830 --> 05:18:36,950
Yeah.

5413
05:18:37,230 --> 05:18:41,750
If you guys can tell me when you're able to go, even if it's
like not on the supports, just fighting their DPS, I can

5414
05:18:41,750 --> 05:18:46,310
just immediately go on backline or frontline and then you
guys have an easier time 1v1ing and we would just win i

5415
05:18:46,310 --> 05:18:51,610
think yeah i think we just need to play faster than they are
because they just take the space and then they're like

5416
05:18:51,610 --> 05:19:02,630
that's what the moonlight wants we can just play first yeah
i agree we got this let's go yeah yeah yeah i think our

5417
05:19:02,630 --> 05:19:11,430
offense would be good i'm gonna ask to play racket next game
i'm legit just playing to larry res your guys just dives and

5418
05:19:11,430 --> 05:19:22,350
give you balls i don't think i can survive another so far
that I know you guys like my balls okay okay I don't think

5419
05:19:22,350 --> 05:19:44,110
I'm gonna die I meant to it's not strong enough okay they
might they might play three tanks here if they're on Three

5420
05:19:44,110 --> 05:19:45,870
tanks, we can just surround them and go back.

5421
05:19:46,650 --> 05:19:48,090
Yeah, you can go three tanks.

5422
05:19:48,250 --> 05:19:50,910
Four, three, two, one, come.

5423
05:19:50,990 --> 05:19:51,270
Come!

5424
05:19:52,130 --> 05:19:52,650
What they can do.

5425
05:19:54,990 --> 05:19:55,970
I'm gonna go under.

5426
05:19:56,310 --> 05:19:56,930
Yeah, I'm gonna go under.

5427
05:19:57,010 --> 05:19:57,910
Let me know what you guys see.

5428
05:19:58,150 --> 05:19:58,570

05:19:58,950 --> 05:19:59,790
The triple tank, yeah.

5430
05:20:00,010 --> 05:20:01,030
I can go backland.

5431

They're bottom left, just let me know.

5432

5448
05:20:19,970 --> 05:20:22,530
I can go backline again whenever you're with me.

5449
05:20:22,790 --> 05:20:23,070
Bucky no hurt.

5450

Yeah, Rogue is behind.

5503
05:21:37,690 --> 05:21:38,610
We should walk.

I'm going back then again.

5505
05:21:40,190 --> 05:21:41,090

05:23:36,410 --> 05:23:36,930
I don't have it.

5609
05:23:37,030 --> 05:23:37,130

tank is crazy there zero two two I don't know why we didn't

5620
05:24:21,750 --> 05:24:24,530
go triple tank healers.

5621
05:24:24,790 --> 05:24:28,950
I feel like if they're not going to allow triple support,
they shouldn't allow triple tank.

5622
05:24:29,890 --> 05:24:32,190
Yeah, I agree with that.

5623
05:24:32,410 --> 05:24:33,710
I don't know.

05:24:36,770 --> 05:24:37,330
All good.

5626
05:24:40,310 --> 05:24:42,590
I either had to heal tanks or my DPS.

5627
05:24:43,570 --> 05:24:46,730
It's kind of like, it's kind of fucked up how they can play

And sorry, I'm echoing really bad.

5629
05:24:49,570 --> 05:24:54,630
they can they can play dive and then we can't play triple
support to deny the dive but then we have to ban out dive

5630
05:24:54,630 --> 05:25:02,790
and then they can just play triple ping like that doesn't
make sense mm-hmm i agree uh i think we do go to losers

5631
05:25:02,790 --> 05:25:10,070
right yeah we do yeah we do yeah like two or three matches i
mean i said that before too yeah i was gonna say like what

5632
05:25:10,070 --> 05:25:17,250
the do we do against that would be bad out triple support
sounds good well there was nothing we could do because like

5633
05:25:21,610 --> 05:25:25,510
hour it says 6 30.

5634
05:25:28,130 --> 05:25:39,490
can we ask to do it earlier it because mrc is it's not yeah
i mean it's not even broadcasted yeah i agree yeah

5635
05:25:39,490 --> 05:25:48,290
apparently you can't see triple i was gonna say please don't
i'm just surprised we didn't go we didn't go like also if

5636
05:25:48,290 --> 05:25:59,170
they are gonna play triple tank i don't think we play um i
don't think we can play dive deep yes yeah i don't think

5637
05:25:59,170 --> 05:26:08,130
that makes sense i think yeah i think we just play like
storm pine or something yeah sure i'm surprised we stuck

5638
05:26:08,130 --> 05:26:16,510
with that i think it's gonna i get the one denim or cap okay
i don't know if that would been better they just go for bad

5639
05:26:16,510 --> 05:26:24,810
coin we could have probably committed to that i think if
we're gonna stay that dps lineup probably but i i agree with

5640
05:26:24,810 --> 05:26:35,310
our i think they said we're funny storm yeah i said they're
uh making the lobby we're doing it earlier so thank god okay

5641
05:26:35,310 --> 05:26:47,750
nice guys thank god thank god thank god they're making the
lobby now because it's not broadcast thank the lords

5642
05:26:52,660 --> 05:27:00,020
because they didn't think I don't know I guess they thought
that not a lot the teams were gonna play dive you know dive

5643
05:27:00,020 --> 05:27:07,860
is meta and this team perfectly select like this team is
very stacked and they also selected all the players that

5644
05:27:07,860 --> 05:27:23,560
play heavy dive nobody here really plays dive this team we
have i we all the dive characters we have what is starlord

5645
05:27:23,560 --> 05:27:35,520
and and sad lucky i think i'm tired now i'm actually so
tired you don't have to think too much yeah this is like

5646
05:27:35,520 --> 05:27:41,800
three tanks a lot of damage made it's that simple i feel
like i feel like they should just make two two two they

5647
05:27:41,800 --> 05:27:49,680
should just wear two two two if they're just gonna bad
triple support might as every fucking triple whatever

5648
05:27:52,720 --> 05:28:03,780
no every game every game drains my life force every hour
drains me I thought I could take a nap right up because I

5649
05:28:03,780 --> 05:28:19,100
had to wake up at fucking 8 30 in the morning I had to wake
up at 8 30 guys it's 2 42 I thought I could have nap time

5650
05:28:19,100 --> 05:28:21,100
before the cafe.

5651
05:28:35,070 --> 05:28:36,630
No, I don't know.

5652
05:28:37,490 --> 05:28:38,430
I don't know.

5653
05:28:38,970 --> 05:28:42,430
If we get knocked out, it would be a shame if we get knocked
out.

5654
05:28:49,390 --> 05:29:00,050
Okay, so Moxie's team said that their players were told 6.30
EST, so he doesn't know to be able to get back on, but he's

5655
05:29:00,050 --> 05:29:00,570
trying.

5656
05:29:04,130 --> 05:29:14,930
So either they get back on Or they get back on early Because
or the tournament has to find me a sub Because they promised

5657
05:29:14,930 --> 05:29:24,890
me the tournament would end before 4 So The only issue is
Necros just went offline I have to Wait is that on Check out

5658
05:29:24,890 --> 05:29:36,290
at 4 No, Necros is it for you Doki It's like 243 And I have
to for sure because I have a contract obligation at four and

5659
05:29:36,290 --> 05:29:46,450
they told me that it'll end by four I think it will it's
just this one match surely they can just get on and play it

5660
05:29:47,530 --> 05:29:52,090
I gave them 30 I gave 430, but I'm taking it back.

5661
05:29:52,750 --> 05:29:54,490
I'm taking the fourth fourth.

5662
05:29:54,650 --> 05:30:03,930
I'm taking the 30 minutes back If I didn't have to wait this
long I would have given this that 30 minutes but i'm taking

5663
05:30:03,930 --> 05:30:15,770
it back now i'm leaving at four i'm giving them the original
plan yeah ban for legendary not that was my original deal

5664
05:30:16,850 --> 05:30:27,490
like it's flexible yeah i gave it yeah like i so if we go in
there like legendary is gonna shut down a firm's revoked i

5665
05:30:27,490 --> 05:30:30,830
just didn't think it would be a back-to-back wait

5666
05:30:36,800 --> 05:30:50,620
yeah that's just being generous like I've like I agreed for
four we made a deal that is four yeah to buy to a new lobby

5667
05:30:50,620 --> 05:31:03,740
okay Vendor D is like a Hulk main yeah he's on yeah and he's
on rogue yeah technically not clocking out early guys it's

5668
05:31:03,740 --> 05:31:14,960
not clocking out early because the original plan was for it
was today during the stream i tried to be nice but then like

5669
05:31:14,960 --> 05:31:26,500
it's gone she's gone now she's dead i'm dead inside the doki
originally there is god no they don't what the around goslin

5670
05:31:26,500 --> 05:31:39,960
removed me they did last map playing oh really she's she's
out of her she said she played the other match yeah she said

5671
05:31:39,960 --> 05:31:48,420
she can play no woofos is in she's not in oh oh there you go
never mind yeah I think woofos been playing yeah

5672
05:31:56,520 --> 05:32:08,160
this is a 9 to 5 the thing is I have overtime after the
thing is I don't get paid to be here compared to the main

5673
05:32:08,160 --> 05:32:12,560
cafe yeah maybe That's the only thing.

5674
05:32:12,880 --> 05:32:15,120
I'll get paid to be at the big cafe.

5675
05:32:15,280 --> 05:32:16,680
I'll get paid to be here.

5676
05:32:16,700 --> 05:32:17,720
Yeah, you're well done, nice shit.

5677
05:32:18,900 --> 05:32:23,000
I think, yeah, we need, like, Moon Knight or Storm Pond or
something.

5678
05:32:23,660 --> 05:32:23,980
You're right.

5679
05:32:24,000 --> 05:32:25,180
It's my second job.

5680
05:32:25,360 --> 05:32:26,960
Well, because it's like...

5681
05:32:29,660 --> 05:32:34,960
And then I probably should have been low-key, like, as soon
as we are on, like, front to back like that.

5682
05:32:37,040 --> 05:32:37,380
Yeah.

5683
05:32:39,660 --> 05:32:40,200
That's okay.

5684
05:32:40,380 --> 05:32:40,720
We learned.

5685
05:32:41,260 --> 05:32:42,220
It's such a cheat.

5686
05:32:42,420 --> 05:32:42,640
Yep.

5687
05:32:42,820 --> 05:32:43,060
Yep.

5688
05:32:43,120 --> 05:32:43,600
Got it.

5689
05:32:43,620 --> 05:32:53,040
going forward they don't have spider-man play at least i
think not allow autofun luna to be replaced with fun are we

5690
05:32:53,040 --> 05:33:03,600
are we playing the moxie team yeah i think so there's a new
lobby to get you all in here they uh they were playing like

5691
05:33:03,600 --> 05:33:14,320
ultron mantis like with widow when i saw them they're
playing like super pocket dps run around i don't know if i

5692
05:33:14,320 --> 05:33:25,160
want to get coffee is coffee okay for your after tooth
extraction widow widow yeah that guy's kind of crazy at

5693
05:33:25,160 --> 05:33:33,900
widow i can't lie honestly i might be a mantis ban ingle
because i think mantis is what enables all of that weird

5694
05:33:33,900 --> 05:33:40,920
stuff yeah probably like ban hella first then ban mantis
next i think that's actually ideal

5695
05:33:44,600 --> 05:33:53,860
do they have a daredevil player uh tarot can play it but he
doesn't like playing it yeah i don't think tarot play it

5696
05:33:53,860 --> 05:34:07,080
strategize i'm just i'm like the mascot they called me in
and i just poof in it's like when animations it's like it's

5697
05:34:07,080 --> 05:34:12,160
like i swear there's the hell look through their background
assets and we're like we need background characters and he

5698
05:34:12,160 --> 05:34:18,340
just pulled me out of the background folder sorry terra and
all right the scene is about to start we gotta fill up this

5699
05:34:18,340 --> 05:34:32,080
scene i'm getting information that let them all they were
playing torch let them all do the strategizing yeah that's

5700
05:34:32,080 --> 05:34:41,340
pretty crazy we bought an ultron definitely pain killer was
supposed to be for my tooth but i guess this is for my head

5701
05:34:41,340 --> 05:34:52,360
now the skin killers from my head down yeah we don't
impeller yeah it's the same person i'm losing it the longer

5702
05:34:52,360 --> 05:35:04,920
we wait and i'm not in the lobby the longer i'm gonna freak
out slow the game down fan like mantis i think it was six

5703
05:35:04,920 --> 05:35:13,980
hours a back-to-back i don't i don't but if i'm on my six
game six or seven game on my six hour that'd be fine the

5704
05:35:13,980 --> 05:35:27,140
fact that i'm on my third i'm waiting for my third game like
i that is yeah he does he plays everything i think that's

5705
05:35:27,140 --> 05:35:34,420
where my brain is gone i'm waiting for my third game to be
like i don't want to play this and he won't play it during

5706
05:35:34,420 --> 05:35:37,000
the almost six hours

5707
05:35:40,800 --> 05:35:57,900
yeah this is only the third game I played the second game we
lost what a game too Cal, you have a super chat thank you,

5708
05:35:57,980 --> 05:35:58,940
thank you

5709
05:36:03,820 --> 05:36:13,600
it's just poor organization like what can you do it's just
the poor like if it's this is their first tournament they

5710
05:36:13,600 --> 05:36:22,860
organized i'd understand ideally they just want like they
just want to funnel all the numbers into one channel that's

5711
05:36:22,860 --> 05:36:26,020
that's playing i'm still annoyed that we can't play triple
support

5712
05:36:31,440 --> 05:36:39,960
not bad no this is gonna be our third game like uh 50 50.

5713
05:36:40,240 --> 05:36:47,480
and then when i found out the first team was not even
brought in that's that's where it broke me that's where it

5714
05:36:47,480 --> 05:36:48,620
fucking broke me

5715
05:36:54,660 --> 05:37:04,460
no i no i just it changes the game so much my friends is
also like yeah you sure you're gonna you should my manager

5716
05:37:04,460 --> 05:37:12,740
sure you should do this i was like it'll be fun it'll be fun
they still definitely be over before then

5717
05:37:16,280 --> 05:37:22,260
I mean, not instant, but it's definitely not bad.

5718
05:37:25,640 --> 05:37:27,940
I think it's good because they only have two sports behind
them.

5719
05:37:30,460 --> 05:37:31,320
They just get reloaded.

5720
05:37:33,900 --> 05:37:37,920
It goes until 9pm.

5721
05:37:40,700 --> 05:37:41,480
I haven't.

5722
05:37:43,240 --> 05:37:47,400
I mean, I had my chicken nuggies, but like that doesn't feel
like it counts.

5723
05:37:47,620 --> 05:37:49,040
Honestly, let me check.

5724
05:37:56,090 --> 05:37:57,210
It's a long day.

5725
05:37:57,310 --> 05:37:59,690
That's why I'm saying it is a really long day for me.

5726
05:38:02,210 --> 05:38:03,830
No, I'm not doing this again.

5727
05:38:04,030 --> 05:38:05,490
I'm not double booking.

5728
05:38:05,750 --> 05:38:12,370
I'm not scheduling a stream and an event at the same time.

5729
05:38:12,490 --> 05:38:13,550
I have an event at that time.

5730
05:38:13,730 --> 05:38:15,250
I'm fucking, it's that's event day.

5731
05:38:15,910 --> 05:38:17,630
I can't do this again.

5732
05:38:18,470 --> 05:38:19,470
I can't.

5733
05:38:20,810 --> 05:38:21,510
strong enough

5734
05:38:26,720 --> 05:38:38,320
yeah lessons were learned I learned my lesson today yeah
sorry 9 30 most likely at 10 it ends at 10 because we went

5735
05:38:38,320 --> 05:38:48,940
overtime for yesterday so I'm most likely it'll end at 10
don't worry guys I'll get I might actually have to get

5736
05:38:48,940 --> 05:38:57,060
coffee yeah I never had a tournament this fucking delayed
before she

5737
05:39:03,330 --> 05:39:09,310
learned no i will i learned this step i learned this step
i'm sorry if it feels like i'm complaining too much i'm

5738
05:39:09,310 --> 05:39:20,970
actually so fried right now i just just i just don't like
waiting so long in between games i just i'm sorry guys can

5739
05:39:20,970 --> 05:39:25,010
you really blame me i really don't like waiting this

5740
05:39:59,650 --> 05:40:03,270
I also said yes because I saw the names in this tournament.

5741
05:40:03,670 --> 05:40:10,590
I was like, oh, hey, it's all like, you know, a ton of, you
know, big content creators and pros.

5742
05:40:11,310 --> 05:40:13,870
It should be, it should be fine.

5743
05:40:14,470 --> 05:40:21,750
You know, you would think it'd be more, like, like, because
they were saying it's going to be like Vogue or Bash.

5744
05:40:21,850 --> 05:40:24,190
And I didn't, I was invited for Vogue or Bash.

5745
05:40:24,510 --> 05:40:28,650
So I was like, oh, it's going to be like Vogue or Bash
because apparently that was very smoothly read.

5746
05:40:29,370 --> 05:40:40,750
the same people from Bougar Bash, but I don't think, now I
don't think, now I don't think it's the same people as

5747
05:40:40,750 --> 05:40:42,210
Bougar Bash.

5748
05:40:44,850 --> 05:40:45,770
What are you organizers?

5749
05:40:46,270 --> 05:40:46,810
I don't know.

5750
05:40:46,870 --> 05:40:48,190
It's the European group.

5751
05:41:12,360 --> 05:41:12,720
Yeah.

5752
05:41:13,460 --> 05:41:17,760
It's, it's, it's officially sponsored by NetE slash Rivals.

5753
05:41:18,360 --> 05:41:20,260
It's officially sponsored by them.

5754
05:41:20,900 --> 05:41:35,560
Um, but uh uh but it's you know like they're usually hands
off marvel rivals is usually hands off when it comes to

5755
05:41:35,560 --> 05:41:43,820
organization of uh tournaments that's why you see a lot of
tournaments that are like all over like you remember the one

5756
05:41:43,820 --> 05:41:50,640
i fucking subbed in for the daredevil tournament that i
subbed in for it oh my god that one was a mess

5757
05:42:06,300 --> 05:42:09,000
I think it is that the same people for that.

5758
05:42:09,120 --> 05:42:09,840
I'm not sure.

5759
05:42:12,160 --> 05:42:13,880
It might be the same people.

5760
05:42:16,480 --> 05:42:19,080
Hey, make sure you guys are in the new lobby, by the way.

5761
05:42:22,200 --> 05:42:24,360

05:43:19,780 --> 05:43:20,860
I just F my stream.

5771
05:43:21,140 --> 05:43:23,060
There's not a drop of life in AIG.

5772
05:43:23,500 --> 05:43:24,820
There's no more.

5773
05:43:25,100 --> 05:43:27,300
I think so.

5774
05:43:27,900 --> 05:43:28,600
Yeah, there is.

5775
05:43:29,060 --> 05:43:30,700
There's no more life in me.

5776
05:43:32,260 --> 05:43:33,720
They siphoned it out.

5777
05:43:33,900 --> 05:43:35,140
Every dive they did.

5778
05:43:35,700 --> 05:43:38,520
I age 10 years.

5779
05:43:38,920 --> 05:43:41,700
I'm literally on my deathbed right now.

5780
05:43:43,760 --> 05:43:44,640
Nope.

5781
05:43:45,540 --> 05:43:46,560
Get back.

5782
05:43:47,420 --> 05:43:48,040
Um, surely.

5783
05:43:48,240 --> 05:43:50,400
There's nothing inside me anymore.

5784
05:43:50,700 --> 05:43:55,320
I'm stead inside the doki that started the stream.

5785
05:43:55,740 --> 05:43:56,640
They got her.

5786
05:44:00,740 --> 05:44:02,660
They got her.

5787
05:44:05,720 --> 05:44:08,220
The least dramatic doki.

5788
05:44:09,140 --> 05:44:11,840
Just a dry husk of a woman.

5789
05:44:15,740 --> 05:44:31,080
the tomato is get the tomatoes riding it's gone now it's
just the skin suit left it's only the skin what's going on

just played rogue that's what's happened oh this is

5796
05:45:54,650 --> 05:46:04,070
definitely the longest i've ever waited like i've actually
here's money to cheer me up and i've had like thank you

5797
05:46:04,070 --> 05:46:12,430
thank you i really appreciate it six games where people
throw because i'm on the character this is actually a new

5798
05:46:12,430 --> 05:46:19,510
record or i won't give it i would have played at least five
games in apex or then i would go against cypher or cooper

5799
05:46:19,510 --> 05:46:26,690
playing triple supports yeah i would have had like five or
six matches

5800
05:46:30,030 --> 05:46:37,950
yeah no it's just legit so all the time there's like the the
two people that push for top one just triple supports and if

5801
05:46:37,950 --> 05:46:46,990
you don't match it gg unless you have like yeah an entire
good lobby which never happens so gg oh this is basically it

5802
05:46:46,990 --> 05:46:55,210
can i just take oh i'm playing against gambit mantis okay
every guys this is a win-win yeah if we win that's cool you

5803
05:46:55,210 --> 05:47:03,870
can batting progress we get more money if we lose and people
will still don't have to play day two yeah it's just depends

5804
05:47:03,870 --> 05:47:12,350
on the win-win for everyone it's so bad i mean the ultra
yeah just made it worse this patch so yeah so true i don't

5805
05:47:12,350 --> 05:47:18,890
even win more money lose i'm free at this point.

5806
05:47:22,030 --> 05:47:23,570
It's a win-win.

5807
05:47:23,990 --> 05:47:24,810
Not close at all.

5808
05:47:25,570 --> 05:47:26,190
Oh, okay.

5809
05:47:26,790 --> 05:47:28,570
I'm like close to captain, I think.

5810
05:47:29,530 --> 05:47:30,910
Yeah, I'm like close to captain.

5811
05:47:31,450 --> 05:47:33,350
But it's so hard to make progress on this character.

5812
05:47:33,630 --> 05:47:35,950
She used to stream at least 12 hours straight or rank Apex
in the past.

5813
05:47:36,090 --> 05:47:44,530
But the thing is, when I stream 12 hours of Apex, there's no
two hour in between waiting for games.

5814
05:47:45,250 --> 05:47:46,030
That's the issue.

5815
05:47:47,590 --> 05:47:49,190
I didn't have to wait.

5816
05:47:49,210 --> 05:47:49,490
wait.

5817
05:47:49,950 --> 05:47:50,970
I queue up.

5818
05:47:51,450 --> 05:47:57,330
I have to wait at most 10 minutes and then I get to play.

5819
05:47:58,630 --> 05:47:59,350
Are we out here?

5820
05:47:59,490 --> 05:48:00,390
They're all screen ready.

5821
05:48:01,010 --> 05:48:01,190
Yeah.

5822
05:48:03,650 --> 05:48:04,210
Yeah.

5823
05:48:09,570 --> 05:48:13,770
You win all the waiting would be worth it.

5824
05:48:14,290 --> 05:48:16,870
Do you get bodied by Melio's team again?

5825
05:48:17,010 --> 05:48:18,050
Come on, guys.

5826
05:48:20,410 --> 05:48:22,290
That's so hot with you.

5827
05:48:23,470 --> 05:48:28,430
Yeah, let me download some fucking PC controller program
real quick.

5828
05:48:32,170 --> 05:48:36,470
I'm ordering coffee after this, or I'm going downstairs to
get coffee.

5829
05:48:41,560 --> 05:48:41,780
Oh!

5830
05:48:44,220 --> 05:48:49,240
No, I just think it's so, like, they don't give us a time
frame, too.

5831
05:48:49,380 --> 05:48:53,440
When our matches start, I think our captain asked, like, oh,
when's our next match?

5832
05:48:53,620 --> 05:48:55,480
And then they weren't even given the time.

5833
05:48:55,500 --> 05:49:00,620
frame like the schedule is behind schedule who who would
have thought

5834
05:49:04,010 --> 05:49:15,710
not sure coffee is good after two if guys I have nothing
there's nothing else I can do no skin your

5835
05:49:22,160 --> 05:49:29,680

They're asking.

5842
05:51:08,710 --> 05:51:09,090
R.

5843
05:51:18,940 --> 05:51:20,680
Yes, we get to play.

5844
05:51:21,480 --> 05:51:21,960
Yay.

5845
05:51:23,040 --> 05:51:23,720

Thank goodness.

5848
05:51:29,160 --> 05:51:29,320
Yeah.

5849
05:51:30,660 --> 05:51:31,880
Did we play another game?

5850
05:51:32,380 --> 05:51:32,700
I don't remember.

5851
05:51:34,000 --> 05:51:34,900
This is the last one.

5852
05:51:35,860 --> 05:51:37,540
Oh, thank God.

5853
05:51:38,600 --> 05:51:39,600
Thank God.

5854
05:51:39,600 --> 05:51:40,080
Thank God.

5855

Thank God.

5856
05:51:40,740 --> 05:51:41,240
All right.

5857
05:51:42,980 --> 05:51:43,760
Thank God.

5858
05:51:44,180 --> 05:51:45,100
You know that's fucked.

5859
05:51:46,100 --> 05:51:46,640
Hello, first band.

5860
05:51:47,400 --> 05:51:48,520

So you're just like, thank God.

5862
05:51:53,920 --> 05:51:55,260
I don't know.

5863
05:51:55,460 --> 05:51:56,020
I don't know.

5864
05:51:56,460 --> 05:51:56,500
Oh, fuck.

5865
05:51:58,340 --> 05:51:59,640
I think we've been that guy's hell.

5866
05:51:59,640 --> 05:52:00,260
I think Color is better for us.

5867
05:52:00,800 --> 05:52:01,240
Montes.

5868
05:52:01,400 --> 05:52:02,000
Montes.

5869
05:52:02,800 --> 05:52:10,540
i think i was i had tears coming i think yeah i think
definitely we still i could actually see the light at the

5870
05:52:10,540 --> 05:52:25,420
end of the tunnel joy i was like so it's over no matter
maybe i want gambit um i want gambit yeah yeah i think so

5871
05:52:25,420 --> 05:52:33,420

ufus i don't think i've oh that's true They do have a gambit

5872
05:52:33,420 --> 05:52:34,200
player, huh?

5873
05:52:34,660 --> 05:52:35,020
Okay.

5874
05:52:35,540 --> 05:52:36,100
Yeah, they do have a...

5875
05:52:36,100 --> 05:52:36,520
I think it's fine.

5876
05:52:36,660 --> 05:52:38,560
I think we can mirror their gambit.

5877
05:52:39,480 --> 05:52:40,700
I think it's favored for us.

5878
05:52:41,000 --> 05:52:41,360
I think we ban Loki.

5879
05:52:42,480 --> 05:52:44,300
I think Loki is definitely banned.

5880
05:52:45,060 --> 05:52:46,900
Ironically, you don't think you protect DPS instead?

5881
05:52:47,260 --> 05:52:48,460
I don't think they even want to ban Gams.

5882
05:52:48,800 --> 05:52:49,940
That's up to you.

5883
05:52:50,220 --> 05:52:50,900
Yeah, we can.

5884
05:52:50,960 --> 05:52:51,500
We can protect.

5885
05:52:51,880 --> 05:52:52,540
Go, go, go.

5886
05:52:53,020 --> 05:52:53,860
Alright, I've attacked Starland.

5887
05:52:55,080 --> 05:52:55,600
That works.

5888
05:52:56,940 --> 05:52:58,760
Um, I think we ban...

5889
05:52:58,760 --> 05:53:00,400
I always drink ice coffee.

5890
05:53:00,760 --> 05:53:02,000
Or caffeine, that's ice.

5891
05:53:02,160 --> 05:53:02,780
Because I don't think they're going to ban him.

5892

I'm going...

5938
05:56:11,380 --> 05:56:11,840
Yeah.

5939
05:56:11,840 --> 05:56:13,300
I'm gonna avoid the Greech.

5940
05:56:13,500 --> 05:56:14,220
Yeah, I'm going point.

5941
05:56:14,420 --> 05:56:15,260
I'm not letting Greech start up.

5942
05:56:16,940 --> 05:56:18,780
Nels, not dodge.

5943
05:56:19,780 --> 05:56:22,400
Sar, Sar, Sar, Sar, Sar, Sar, one.

5944
05:56:22,640 --> 05:56:23,880
I need to kill him.

5945
05:56:24,700 --> 05:56:26,120
Rook and die, Rook and die.

5946
05:56:26,180 --> 05:56:26,300
Look at this.

5947
05:56:26,300 --> 05:56:27,020
Three, two, one.

5948
05:56:27,860 --> 05:56:28,460
Don't flank him.

5949
05:56:28,460 --> 05:56:29,580
Look at Rook, look at Rook.

5950
05:56:29,780 --> 05:56:30,020
Look at Rook.

5951
05:56:30,420 --> 05:56:31,100
Shooting King, left out.

5952
05:56:31,860 --> 05:56:32,540
Their Groot is back.

5953
05:56:33,180 --> 05:56:33,420
One.

5954
05:56:34,000 --> 05:56:34,560
I'll reload.

5955
05:56:34,800 --> 05:56:35,260
I have to reload.

5956
05:56:35,860 --> 05:56:36,700
I'll fight him points.

5957
05:56:39,220 --> 05:56:40,480
I need help on point.

5958
05:56:40,760 --> 05:56:41,020
Oh wow.

5959
05:56:41,420 --> 05:56:41,820
Oh.

5960
05:56:41,840 --> 05:56:46,120
Good one, good one, good one, good one.

5961
05:56:51,150 --> 05:56:51,890
I'm gonna swap.

5962
05:56:55,250 --> 05:56:55,410
Okay.

5963
05:57:03,970 --> 05:57:04,690
Keybinds aren't right.

5964
05:57:06,490 --> 05:57:08,210
Cover for you guys.

5965
05:57:13,190 --> 05:57:14,170
Let's surround him.

5966
05:57:14,350 --> 05:57:15,030
Let's start broken up.

5967
05:57:15,150 --> 05:57:16,170
Yeah, can we walk one side?

5968
05:57:16,350 --> 05:57:16,790
Can we?

5969
05:57:16,790 --> 05:57:17,710
Yeah, I'm walking with you.

5970
05:57:18,130 --> 05:57:20,030
I'm taking left and three, two, one.

5971
05:57:20,050 --> 05:57:20,890
Taking left.

5972
05:57:23,490 --> 05:57:24,210
I want him back on again.

5973
05:57:24,230 --> 05:57:26,410
I'm going to open.

5974
05:57:26,510 --> 05:57:27,130
I'm going to go in Gherds.

5975
05:57:27,710 --> 05:57:29,810
Ha, oh, but they have a good 12.

5976
05:57:31,310 --> 05:57:31,810
R2, good one, good one.

5977
05:57:31,810 --> 05:57:32,290
We'll market all here.

5978
05:57:33,110 --> 05:57:33,910
Open one.

5979
05:57:34,390 --> 05:57:34,970
Rojas have.

5980
05:57:34,970 --> 05:57:35,370
Did we break it?

5981
05:57:37,090 --> 05:57:37,870
Did I break it?

5982
05:57:37,870 --> 05:57:38,250
Did they break it?

5983
05:57:38,290 --> 05:57:38,550
Did they break it?

5984
05:57:39,310 --> 05:57:39,910
Oh, yeah.

5985
05:57:41,110 --> 05:57:41,150
Come.

5986
05:57:42,310 --> 05:57:42,830
Good swing.

5987
05:57:43,790 --> 05:57:44,330
It's men.

5988
05:57:44,830 --> 05:57:46,130
We still have Phoenix.

5989
05:57:46,750 --> 05:57:47,670
I'll say we have one more.

5990
05:57:48,250 --> 05:57:49,450
One, one, one, one, one, one.

5991
05:57:50,050 --> 05:57:50,490
Stunt.

5992
05:57:56,990 --> 05:57:57,670
He's one.

5993
05:57:59,570 --> 05:58:00,030
He's out.

5994
05:58:00,370 --> 05:58:01,550
They swapped by the way.

5995
05:58:01,770 --> 05:58:02,250
Off group.

5996
05:58:02,910 --> 05:58:03,650
Yeah, they're an Angela.

5997
05:58:04,030 --> 05:58:04,250
I'm here.

5998
05:58:04,950 --> 05:58:09,850
Do I just hold it until they Phoenix ult or just pray that
we shoot it?

5999
05:58:10,450 --> 05:58:12,150
You can put it where they put it.

6000
05:58:13,790 --> 05:58:15,450
All right, goodbye.

6001
05:58:17,230 --> 05:58:18,350
I grabbed them, I grabbed them.

6002
05:58:18,610 --> 05:58:19,390
I got the ult off.

6003
05:58:21,610 --> 05:58:23,610
I'm alting their back when I got two scores.

6004
05:58:24,770 --> 05:58:25,670
Coming with you.

6005
05:58:26,810 --> 05:58:27,650
Phoenix round.

6006
05:58:27,890 --> 05:58:29,210
Star one, star one, star one.

6007
05:58:29,810 --> 05:58:30,550
Coming back.

6008
05:58:31,650 --> 05:58:32,830
Shocking my res.

6009
05:58:33,970 --> 05:58:34,790
I'm with you.

6010
05:58:34,890 --> 05:58:36,390
My res is at point.

6011
05:58:36,610 --> 05:58:37,430
Phoenix is on.

6012
05:58:37,810 --> 05:58:39,650
Angel can die.

6013
05:58:40,850 --> 05:58:42,170
When we do them, Andrew, how?

6014
05:58:42,830 --> 05:58:43,530
He is okay.

6015
05:58:44,890 --> 05:58:45,550
Yeah, we're good.

6016
05:58:45,790 --> 05:58:45,990
We're good.

6017
05:58:46,170 --> 05:58:46,410
We won.

6018
05:58:47,670 --> 05:58:48,090
Alright.

6019
05:58:48,430 --> 05:58:49,270
I'm done, by the way.

6020
05:58:49,650 --> 05:58:50,010
I'm not there.

6021
05:58:51,610 --> 05:58:52,030
That's okay.

6022
05:58:52,570 --> 05:58:53,470
We can play on point.

6023
05:58:54,010 --> 05:58:55,330
We're still, we're still down one guys.

6024
05:58:55,490 --> 05:58:56,350
Just wait.

6025
05:58:56,750 --> 05:58:57,470
Almost back on.

6026
05:58:57,990 --> 05:58:59,370
Can we, can we play outside?

6027
05:59:00,290 --> 05:59:00,510
I'm gonna play outside.

6028
05:59:00,830 --> 05:59:01,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6029
05:59:01,510 --> 05:59:01,990
I'm gonna get them outside.

6030
05:59:02,030 --> 05:59:02,590
I'm on point, I'm on point.

6031
05:59:03,490 --> 05:59:04,610
I'm gonna look for a steal soon.

6032
05:59:04,970 --> 05:59:06,050
I'm looking for a steal on right side.

6033
05:59:06,270 --> 05:59:06,830
Three, two, one.

6034
05:59:06,850 --> 05:59:08,010
Look at Angela.

6035
05:59:08,970 --> 05:59:09,510
I got Charlotte.

6036
05:59:09,630 --> 05:59:10,090
I got Charlotte's out.

6037
05:59:10,430 --> 05:59:10,850
Charlotte's out.

6038
05:59:12,150 --> 05:59:12,790
I'm on this one.

6039
05:59:12,970 --> 05:59:13,650
I'm on this one.

6040
05:59:13,970 --> 05:59:14,410
I can touch you.

6041
05:59:14,430 --> 05:59:14,730
I'm touching.

6042
05:59:14,890 --> 05:59:14,970
I'm touching.

6043
05:59:14,990 --> 05:59:15,130
I'm touching.

6044
05:59:15,130 --> 05:59:15,450
I can kill Rocky.

6045
05:59:15,590 --> 05:59:15,990
I can kill Rocky.

6046
05:59:17,070 --> 05:59:18,130
Oh my God.

6047
05:59:18,410 --> 05:59:18,430
Okay.

6048
05:59:18,570 --> 05:59:18,670
Rocky died.

6049
05:59:21,610 --> 05:59:22,670
I'm gonna die soon.

6050
05:59:24,330 --> 05:59:24,950
It's quite a bit.

6051
05:59:25,470 --> 05:59:26,070
We have a lot of holes.

6052
05:59:27,090 --> 05:59:27,590
Yeah, they used Angela Ultra.

6053
05:59:27,590 --> 05:59:27,830
Yeah, they used Angela Ultra.

6054
05:59:28,410 --> 05:59:31,390
Things are gonna be different this time.

6055
05:59:33,330 --> 05:59:37,410
You can get our Ultron and then if I don't point them,
they're taking too much space when they shouldn't be able

6056
05:59:37,410 --> 05:59:37,610
to.

6057
05:59:38,610 --> 05:59:42,290
I mean, they were taking space while you were coming back
and then they have holes.

6058
05:59:42,870 --> 05:59:43,270
Okay.

6059
05:59:46,150 --> 05:59:47,730
Oh, there's a starter too.

6060
05:59:47,810 --> 05:59:50,110
Oh, I have to get rid of that.

6061
05:59:51,630 --> 05:59:52,170
Yeah, I have.

6062
05:59:52,190 --> 05:59:52,990
I'm ready whenever a captain.

6063
05:59:54,810 --> 05:59:55,810
I'm walking on points.

6064
05:59:56,070 --> 05:59:56,870
I'm fighting Roach.

6065
05:59:57,150 --> 05:59:57,630
I'm okay.

6066
05:59:58,170 --> 05:59:58,790
Roach is half.

6067
05:59:58,970 --> 05:59:59,630
I need care.

6068
05:59:59,770 --> 06:00:00,510
Can you, can you, can you, can you?

6069
06:00:01,050 --> 06:00:01,630
I'm trying.

6070
06:00:01,850 --> 06:00:02,150
I'm rising.

6071
06:00:02,250 --> 06:00:05,250
I can't give to you, but I'm sure you.

6072
06:00:05,250 --> 06:00:06,070
Roach is one, Roach is one.

6073
06:00:06,950 --> 06:00:07,470
I'm looking for Steel.

6074
06:00:07,590 --> 06:00:08,050
I got Phoenix.

6075
06:00:08,170 --> 06:00:08,490
Phoenix, South.

6076
06:00:08,970 --> 06:00:09,570
Storm on me, Val.

6077
06:00:09,790 --> 06:00:10,310
I got you.

6078
06:00:10,430 --> 06:00:10,810
I'm gonna ult him.

6079
06:00:12,150 --> 06:00:12,930
Oh, he's okay.

6080
06:00:13,050 --> 06:00:13,690
Shoot it, shoot it!

6081
06:00:14,190 --> 06:00:14,370
Oh.

6082
06:00:16,410 --> 06:00:16,970
Ultron can die.

6083
06:00:17,710 --> 06:00:18,530
I'm going for Rafa now.

6084
06:00:18,890 --> 06:00:19,210
He's resting.

6085
06:00:19,310 --> 06:00:19,530
He's resting.

6086
06:00:19,530 --> 06:00:19,610
He's resting.

6087
06:00:21,610 --> 06:00:22,230
Trying to help.

6088
06:00:22,710 --> 06:00:23,390
I'm on point still.

6089
06:00:23,650 --> 06:00:25,070
I'm gonna die soon.

6090
06:00:25,150 --> 06:00:25,670
Yeah, I'm dead.

6091
06:00:27,290 --> 06:00:29,350
No, I'm dead.

6092
06:00:31,470 --> 06:00:32,710
Oh, I'm dead.

6093
06:00:32,710 --> 06:00:32,750
Oh, I'm dead.

6094
06:00:32,750 --> 06:00:33,810
Oh, you're down, yeah.

6095
06:00:37,150 --> 06:00:41,030
Please Starlord, it feels like it's hard for us to be
versatile without it.

6096
06:00:42,550 --> 06:00:43,830
Like where we can go and stuff.

6097
06:00:44,070 --> 06:00:45,590
Because I'm always like gonna anchor man.

6098
06:00:46,050 --> 06:00:47,470
It seems like I just get like all these angles.

6099
06:00:47,770 --> 06:00:48,730
I'm a good guy.

6100
06:00:49,230 --> 06:00:51,270
You know, Starlord's just flanking with drones perfectly.

6101
06:00:52,110 --> 06:00:52,550
Yeah.

6102
06:00:54,270 --> 06:00:56,230
I can't really do anything against them personally.

6103
06:01:02,810 --> 06:01:04,370
I think we just need to kill their Ultron.

6104
06:01:04,550 --> 06:01:05,310
That's unlucky.

6105
06:01:05,590 --> 06:01:07,110
Ultron can barely get you very lucky.

6106
06:01:07,130 --> 06:01:10,910
I didn't put it out the moment that we put it at the same
time.

6107
06:01:13,410 --> 06:01:14,490
He's always low.

6108
06:01:15,590 --> 06:01:17,210
I don't have an angle on this.

6109
06:01:17,730 --> 06:01:20,090
No, my mental is just why I'm on Raffia.

6110
06:01:20,190 --> 06:01:22,870
I was like, I cannot play it right now.

6111
06:01:23,110 --> 06:01:23,430
Or Ultra.

6112
06:01:23,510 --> 06:01:24,890
Ultra is way too much brainpower.

6113
06:01:25,010 --> 06:01:28,650
Like, it's way too much work.

6114
06:01:28,830 --> 06:01:31,010
They're going to have Voltron a lot sooner or sooner soon.

6115
06:01:34,930 --> 06:01:35,930
Is that it?

6116
06:01:36,110 --> 06:01:36,770
Do you think?

6117
06:01:37,750 --> 06:01:38,730
No, they have others.

6118
06:01:38,910 --> 06:01:39,230
I don't know.

6119
06:01:39,430 --> 06:01:40,490
I'm not really locked in.

6120
06:01:41,250 --> 06:01:41,710
They're good.

6121
06:01:43,910 --> 06:01:44,970
I think they have start too.

6122
06:01:45,010 --> 06:01:45,470
I'll leave those support.

6123
06:01:46,850 --> 06:01:47,050
Yeah.

6124
06:01:47,270 --> 06:01:48,110
Right here, Angela.

6125
06:01:49,310 --> 06:01:49,770
Angela won.

6126
06:01:50,050 --> 06:01:50,730
The shoulder is right side.

6127
06:01:50,930 --> 06:01:51,730
They have two right side.

6128
06:01:51,990 --> 06:01:52,290
Yeah, I'm with you.

6129
06:01:52,730 --> 06:01:52,950
Nice.

6130
06:01:53,230 --> 06:01:53,930
Phoenix is top left.

6131
06:01:54,010 --> 06:01:54,250
Phoenix top left.

6132
06:01:55,010 --> 06:01:56,050
with Star Out, okay?

6133
06:01:56,850 --> 06:01:58,330
Yeah, they're setting up right side.

6134
06:02:00,990 --> 06:02:01,750
I'm going under Star Lord.

6135
06:02:02,290 --> 06:02:02,850
I'm on the Out Run.

6136
06:02:03,310 --> 06:02:04,270
Yeah, look, they're that.

6137
06:02:04,390 --> 06:02:04,710
With you.

6138
06:02:05,890 --> 06:02:06,510
Out Run 1.

6139
06:02:06,830 --> 06:02:06,950
Dead.

6140
06:02:07,430 --> 06:02:07,550
Dead.

6141
06:02:08,570 --> 06:02:09,030
I'm on for Rokion.

6142
06:02:09,490 --> 06:02:09,970
Oh, Pippin.

6143
06:02:10,310 --> 06:02:11,230
I'm so off on Rokion.

6144
06:02:11,330 --> 06:02:11,810
I'm on for Rokion.

6145
06:02:12,050 --> 06:02:13,010
Rokin should die.

6146
06:02:14,390 --> 06:02:14,630
Okay.

6147
06:02:14,750 --> 06:02:15,290
Sorry, one, sorry.

6148
06:02:15,550 --> 06:02:15,830
Tawin, Tawin.

6149
06:02:16,010 --> 06:02:16,850
He gets Res.

6150
06:02:17,350 --> 06:02:17,910
On the open point.

6151
06:02:17,990 --> 06:02:18,510
On the open point.

6152
06:02:19,230 --> 06:02:19,730
Yeah, I'm not sure.

6153
06:02:19,870 --> 06:02:20,390
There's no Res.

6154
06:02:20,390 --> 06:02:21,310
Can we kill Rokin?

6155
06:02:22,350 --> 06:02:22,790
Rokin die.

6156
06:02:22,930 --> 06:02:23,170
Oh, my God.

6157
06:02:23,530 --> 06:02:23,790
Rokin.

6158
06:02:25,210 --> 06:02:26,890
There's a starlight behind us.

6159
06:02:26,890 --> 06:02:27,690
Angela, one draw one.

6160
06:02:27,790 --> 06:02:28,290
Star behind, star behind.

6161
06:02:29,170 --> 06:02:29,610
He's right here.

6162
06:02:29,670 --> 06:02:30,350
I'm with you and starlight.

6163
06:02:30,370 --> 06:02:31,030
You guys up.

6164
06:02:32,010 --> 06:02:32,550
He'll keep in.

6165
06:02:33,010 --> 06:02:33,830
Wait, he's left then.

6166
06:02:33,990 --> 06:02:34,110
One.

6167
06:02:34,710 --> 06:02:34,930
Nice.

6168
06:02:40,040 --> 06:02:40,840
Hold on one.

6169
06:02:42,120 --> 06:02:42,900
They still have the revolution.

6170
06:02:43,080 --> 06:02:43,480
I might out here.

6171
06:02:43,740 --> 06:02:44,440
I want to go early.

6172
06:02:44,580 --> 06:02:45,760
I want to go early in the open.

6173
06:02:46,220 --> 06:02:46,660
Can we get ready?

6174
06:02:46,840 --> 06:02:47,080
How early?

6175
06:02:47,220 --> 06:02:47,400
How early?

6176
06:02:47,700 --> 06:02:48,640
I'm setting up close.

6177
06:02:48,780 --> 06:02:49,160
Like, like...

6178
06:02:49,160 --> 06:02:49,500
Like, close.

6179
06:02:50,960 --> 06:02:51,480
Before choke.

6180
06:02:51,740 --> 06:02:52,300
The rockets, man.

6181
06:02:52,480 --> 06:02:52,760
Ready, ready?

6182
06:02:53,000 --> 06:02:53,220
I'm ready.

6183
06:02:56,560 --> 06:02:58,380
Rocket can die.

6184
06:02:58,920 --> 06:02:59,700
I'm gonna rocket.

6185
06:03:00,460 --> 06:03:00,800
Rocket's done.

6186
06:03:01,320 --> 06:03:01,600
Half HP.

6187
06:03:02,100 --> 06:03:04,160
Rocket's half.

6188
06:03:04,480 --> 06:03:04,880
Rocket's low.

6189
06:03:05,600 --> 06:03:06,160
Rocket's low.

6190
06:03:06,180 --> 06:03:07,060
No res, by the way.

6191
06:03:07,100 --> 06:03:08,100
I don't have a bar.

6192
06:03:11,140 --> 06:03:11,940
Okay, I'm backing.

6193
06:03:12,340 --> 06:03:12,900
I saw a little here soon.

6194
06:03:13,940 --> 06:03:14,960
We have bongo and DPS out soon.

6195
06:03:16,320 --> 06:03:16,720
92.

6196
06:03:20,560 --> 06:03:22,200
I can chuck the rest.

6197
06:03:23,320 --> 06:03:24,480
We have bongo soon.

6198
06:03:24,700 --> 06:03:25,760
Are you able to get it?

6199
06:03:27,080 --> 06:03:28,080
We got it.

6200
06:03:28,300 --> 06:03:28,900
You're gonna...

6201
06:03:28,900 --> 06:03:30,400
I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point.

6202
06:03:30,760 --> 06:03:31,060
I'm on point, I'm on point.

6203
06:03:31,100 --> 06:03:32,320
I tried, I can't.

6204
06:03:34,500 --> 06:03:35,080
Can we shoot something?

6205
06:03:35,080 --> 06:03:35,460
I'm dead.

6206
06:03:35,520 --> 06:03:36,660
They just had their rocket on the clock.

6207
06:03:38,140 --> 06:03:39,060
It's okay, they still out.

6208
06:03:39,460 --> 06:03:40,040
Star, maybe can die.

6209
06:03:40,460 --> 06:03:41,380
Star one, star one.

6210
06:03:42,460 --> 06:03:42,920
Star one.

6211
06:03:42,960 --> 06:03:43,940
They have star, Angela.

6212
06:03:44,300 --> 06:03:44,440
You can die.

6213
06:03:44,560 --> 06:03:44,760
You can die.

6214
06:03:45,080 --> 06:03:45,320
Rogue.

6215
06:03:47,580 --> 06:03:47,900
Yeah.

6216
06:03:49,000 --> 06:03:49,900
I think a quick fight.

6217
06:03:50,100 --> 06:03:52,340
I can try and stall the rogue from going in.

6218
06:03:52,480 --> 06:03:53,760
I can't really stop anyone else, so.

6219
06:03:54,640 --> 06:03:56,080
If I get something, I'll look for it.

6220
06:03:57,220 --> 06:03:57,620
Well,

6221
06:04:01,950 --> 06:04:02,610
let's have Angela too.

6222
06:04:02,730 --> 06:04:04,670
We can play still until we get it.

6223
06:04:05,650 --> 06:04:06,510
I'll patch you up.

6224
06:04:07,030 --> 06:04:07,750
I'll just go in top.

6225
06:04:08,530 --> 06:04:09,310
They're playing on points.

6226
06:04:09,470 --> 06:04:10,350
They're beating us on.

6227
06:04:11,210 --> 06:04:11,750
Rogue is on.

6228
06:04:11,930 --> 06:04:12,090
Rogue is on.

6229
06:04:13,230 --> 06:04:15,130
I don't have my raise out.

6230
06:04:20,390 --> 06:04:20,690
Citing.

6231
06:04:21,930 --> 06:04:22,470
One star?

6232
06:04:23,270 --> 06:04:23,610
Yeah.

6233
06:04:24,050 --> 06:04:24,570
No way to go now.

6234
06:04:27,550 --> 06:04:28,710
Oh my god.

6235
06:04:30,850 --> 06:04:31,490
ADMI up.

6236
06:04:32,570 --> 06:04:35,150
Phoenix one Phoenix one

6237
06:04:45,330 --> 06:04:49,470
I can't live I don't think Oh, shit.

6238
06:04:49,870 --> 06:05:03,650
Okay, I shouldn't do all that I'll just wait till his run is
there no they bad mag They bad We have one more fight fight.

6239
06:05:05,310 --> 06:05:06,250
Began, Cumberland went.

6240
06:05:06,550 --> 06:05:08,350
We need to be able to kill him.

6241
06:05:09,290 --> 06:05:10,030
Let's go back.

6242
06:05:11,950 --> 06:05:12,770
Let's walk to main together.

6243
06:05:13,590 --> 06:05:14,150
Yes, sir.

6244
06:05:14,470 --> 06:05:15,490
I'm walking through main, come, come.

6245
06:05:16,030 --> 06:05:16,290
Whoa.

6246
06:05:17,310 --> 06:05:18,390
I'm sitting up over Angela.

6247
06:05:18,410 --> 06:05:18,830
I'm being tired of it.

6248
06:05:20,190 --> 06:05:20,770
Angela, one.

6249
06:05:21,070 --> 06:05:21,910
I'm down there, Angelou.

6250
06:05:22,170 --> 06:05:22,550
Angelou, how?

6251
06:05:22,910 --> 06:05:23,430
There's no cellar.

6252
06:05:25,530 --> 06:05:26,350
What is going in?

6253
06:05:26,470 --> 06:05:27,030
I'm on the road.

6254
06:05:27,350 --> 06:05:27,870
They're pushing me.

6255
06:05:27,870 --> 06:05:28,430
They're pushing me out.

6256
06:05:28,450 --> 06:05:28,930
I have to look for you.

6257
06:05:29,090 --> 06:05:30,070
I'm trying to look for you.

6258
06:05:32,570 --> 06:05:33,030
I need to go.

6259
06:05:33,190 --> 06:05:33,590
I need to go on there.

6260
06:05:33,890 --> 06:05:38,670
I put it in the corner.

6261
06:05:39,610 --> 06:05:39,930
Angela low.

6262
06:05:40,890 --> 06:05:41,450
Can we shoot that?

6263
06:05:42,110 --> 06:05:43,370
They don't rock it all.

6264
06:05:43,450 --> 06:05:43,610
Got it.

6265
06:05:43,770 --> 06:05:44,190
Got it.

6266
06:05:44,270 --> 06:05:47,490
Phoenix one.

6267
06:05:48,170 --> 06:05:48,890
Angela one.

6268
06:05:54,150 --> 06:05:55,710
Should have Phoenix all.

6269
06:05:55,850 --> 06:05:57,870
They have special or all.

6270
06:05:58,550 --> 06:05:59,590
Yeah, that is so.

6271
06:05:59,630 --> 06:06:00,870
We need to make sure we play inside.

6272
06:06:01,050 --> 06:06:02,170
Everything is mine.

6273
06:06:03,630 --> 06:06:04,670
Yeah, we have to make a play.

6274
06:06:05,030 --> 06:06:05,370
It's okay.

6275
06:06:05,550 --> 06:06:07,570
I mean, we can beat them in the open for kill, so...

6276
06:06:08,570 --> 06:06:08,970
Yeah, yeah.

6277
06:06:09,810 --> 06:06:10,070
Yeah.

6278
06:06:10,230 --> 06:06:11,410
Can you drum me here?

6279
06:06:12,290 --> 06:06:12,350
Okay.

6280
06:06:12,670 --> 06:06:13,190
Yeah, you have.

6281
06:06:13,810 --> 06:06:14,570
Oh, I'm on star.

6282
06:06:16,090 --> 06:06:16,270
I'm on star.

6283
06:06:16,750 --> 06:06:17,930
I'm looking Angela right now.

6284
06:06:18,970 --> 06:06:19,810
Angela's south, bottom right.

6285
06:06:20,750 --> 06:06:21,490
Oh my god.

6286
06:06:23,710 --> 06:06:24,030
Angela's dead.

6287
06:06:24,130 --> 06:06:24,490
Angela's dead.

6288
06:06:24,830 --> 06:06:24,870
Nice.

6289
06:06:25,110 --> 06:06:25,710
And she's red.

6290
06:06:25,890 --> 06:06:26,130
She's red.

6291
06:06:26,250 --> 06:06:26,930
Rogan, Rogan.

6292
06:06:27,110 --> 06:06:27,290
I'm with you.

6293
06:06:27,990 --> 06:06:28,890
I'm with you.

6294
06:06:29,050 --> 06:06:29,430
I'm with you.

6295
06:06:29,430 --> 06:06:29,710
Trying to help.

6296
06:06:32,570 --> 06:06:33,650
I will go as soon as they drop that one.

6297
06:06:34,810 --> 06:06:35,750
I just have looking for one.

6298
06:06:35,810 --> 06:06:36,110
One star.

6299
06:06:36,310 --> 06:06:38,570
One star, one star.

6300
06:06:38,870 --> 06:06:39,310
I'm on HP!

6301
06:06:39,570 --> 06:06:39,730
Fuck.

6302
06:06:39,890 --> 06:06:40,810
There's a res coming up.

6303
06:06:40,830 --> 06:06:41,650
There's a res coming up.

6304
06:06:41,790 --> 06:06:42,250
Touching point.

I'm dead.

6310
06:06:47,370 --> 06:06:47,670
Oh my god.

6311
06:06:47,830 --> 06:06:48,310
Roku can die.

6312
06:06:48,330 --> 06:06:48,710
Roku can die.

6313
06:06:49,370 --> 06:06:50,010

Thank you so much.

6315
06:06:51,450 --> 06:06:51,950
One left.

6316
06:06:53,870 --> 06:06:54,910
Someone might need a TP.

6317
06:06:56,030 --> 06:06:56,830
I'm on the altrun.

6318
06:06:57,850 --> 06:06:59,090
I can't touch them, I can't touch.

6319
06:06:59,310 --> 06:07:00,130
Whelp supports looking.

6320
06:07:00,430 --> 06:07:00,990
Oh, he's got me.

6321
06:07:01,130 --> 06:07:01,510
He's got me.

6322
06:07:01,510 --> 06:07:02,090
I'm on point.

6323
06:07:02,150 --> 06:07:02,590
I can't hide.

6324
06:07:04,190 --> 06:07:05,170
He's so one.

6325
06:07:05,670 --> 06:07:06,190
I'm on point.

6326
06:07:06,570 --> 06:07:07,450
I can't do anything else.

6327
06:07:08,170 --> 06:07:08,770
I can't touch.

6328
06:07:09,390 --> 06:07:09,710
I vote.

6329
06:07:10,210 --> 06:07:10,450
I'm okay.

6330
06:07:11,690 --> 06:07:12,370
You heal me?

6331
06:07:13,130 --> 06:07:13,730
Angelus South.

6332
06:07:13,930 --> 06:07:14,910
They can beat back.

6333
06:07:17,490 --> 06:07:18,490
I almost have up.

6334
06:07:19,190 --> 06:07:21,290
I can keep anchoring for a bit.

6335
06:07:22,310 --> 06:07:23,010
I'm getting...

6336
06:07:23,010 --> 06:07:23,510
I got a shield.

6337
06:07:23,630 --> 06:07:23,890
I got a shield.

6338
06:07:23,910 --> 06:07:24,450
I'm on Ultron 1.

6339
06:07:24,490 --> 06:07:25,730
I can set a point for a bit.

6340
06:07:26,570 --> 06:07:28,210
I don't know if that portal is gonna...

6341
06:07:28,210 --> 06:07:29,030
I'm killing Rose Beacon.

6342
06:07:29,370 --> 06:07:29,790
I'm res.

6343
06:07:29,930 --> 06:07:30,190
I'm res.

6344
06:07:30,470 --> 06:07:30,890
I'm on point.

6345
06:07:31,510 --> 06:07:32,890
I need P1 player.

6346
06:07:33,610 --> 06:07:33,990
Can we touch?

6347
06:07:34,430 --> 06:07:34,690
Can we touch?

6348
06:07:34,990 --> 06:07:35,170
Can we touch?

6349
06:07:35,170 --> 06:07:35,510
Yeah, I'm touching.

6350
06:07:35,730 --> 06:07:36,470
I'm gonna die.

6351
06:07:36,550 --> 06:07:37,030
I'm gonna die.

6352
06:07:37,350 --> 06:07:37,590
I'm gonna die.

6353
06:07:38,930 --> 06:07:39,670
I have touch.

6354
06:07:39,790 --> 06:07:40,190
I have touch.

6355
06:07:40,670 --> 06:07:43,710
Oh, we were so close.

6356
06:07:45,490 --> 06:07:46,190
So close.

6357
06:07:46,730 --> 06:07:47,390
So hard.

6358
06:07:51,990 --> 06:07:52,890
Yeah, it's tough.

6359
06:07:53,330 --> 06:07:59,070
Like, I'm just getting marked in headshot by Phoenix the
whole fucking batch.

6360
06:07:59,990 --> 06:08:01,490
It's hard for me to...

6361
06:08:01,510 --> 06:08:17,650
do my job there one more game one more game guys we'll be
free but it's all good one more game just see this yeah

6362
06:08:17,650 --> 06:08:24,930
beatable honestly one thing that one thing that you can do
better for me guys you can ask for when you want damage

6363
06:08:24,930 --> 06:08:33,110
boost and speed boost yeah that's all I can do yeah one more
game yeah we could have do that it's okay what did they

6364
06:08:33,110 --> 06:08:41,850
first been we can just program this next game it's okay i
don't think yeah true they first been i don't think that's

6365
06:08:41,850 --> 06:08:52,030
gonna solve it no i don't think that's gonna make a
difference um i think the problem is that tarot just gets to

6366
06:08:52,030 --> 06:09:02,070
run around on star and we don't have anything to stop it um
i'm sure yeah i mean it was it was hard it was Phoenix is

6367
06:09:02,070 --> 06:09:09,710
just hitting every like left click on me and she has a lot
of damage you can you could leave like hello open if you

6368
06:09:09,710 --> 06:09:17,170
wanted to have more options yeah I think so that's what I
was saying like I think Helen no more is actually better for

6369
06:09:17,170 --> 06:09:40,290
us what what map do we want any favorable ones anyone's in
mind we could do like you just sell yeah probably you could

6370
06:09:40,290 --> 06:09:47,190
surely probably i'm not gonna lie unless you guys have
something in mind for what you guys want to play

6371
06:09:51,090 --> 06:09:52,130
no i'm showing

6372
06:10:01,690 --> 06:10:09,630
yay yeah well it's because their brain is active and mine
isn't

6373
06:10:12,990 --> 06:10:14,110
That's the reason.

6374
06:10:15,930 --> 06:10:20,450
Yeah, it's just people would be less tired if the matches go
by faster.

6375
06:10:21,190 --> 06:10:23,650
But it's because there's too many intermissions.

6376
06:10:24,210 --> 06:10:26,490
So you cool down, like in between.

6377
06:10:27,930 --> 06:10:29,190
You cool down in between.

6378
06:10:29,470 --> 06:10:32,130
So there's like, there's just way too many intermissions.

6379
06:10:33,510 --> 06:10:35,270
Way too many long intermissions.

6380
06:10:35,610 --> 06:10:36,810
Yeah, so people are just tired.

6381
06:10:38,130 --> 06:10:39,910
Like, I'm usually more fun.

6382
06:10:40,070 --> 06:10:41,950
It was just like, pop, pop, pop, pop.

6383
06:10:42,110 --> 06:10:43,250
Like, maybe a 20 minute wait.

6384
06:10:43,330 --> 06:10:46,650
I can wait 20 or 30 minutes, but, like, I can't wait this
long.

6385
06:10:49,730 --> 06:10:51,830
Yeah, the momentum's lost now.

6386
06:10:58,130 --> 06:11:00,190
I mean, she's still on.

6387
06:11:01,170 --> 06:11:01,610
Yeah!

6388
06:11:04,450 --> 06:11:05,650
That's me!

6389
06:11:16,160 --> 06:11:18,560
I definitely have a slight headache, though.

6390
06:11:19,100 --> 06:11:19,640
From this.

6391
06:11:27,910 --> 06:11:29,810
No, you are absolutely losing me.

6392
06:11:37,690 --> 06:11:38,990
I think I just...

6393
06:11:38,990 --> 06:11:40,750
It's just too much.

6394
06:11:45,090 --> 06:11:46,850
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

6395
06:11:48,270 --> 06:11:58,890
i can't even laugh anymore i well except for that one part
but okay so what are we this is no longer a funny situation

6396
06:11:59,580 --> 06:12:12,710
this is no longer funny we could first ban hella again i
think because i kind of play hawkeye in this map i think i

6397
06:12:12,710 --> 06:12:18,290
could be like danos um I think Heliband first.

6398
06:12:18,550 --> 06:12:21,510
I think Ultron banned second, honestly.

6399
06:12:22,890 --> 06:12:23,950
Not gonna lie.

6400
06:12:25,870 --> 06:12:26,830
No, I...

6401
06:12:27,370 --> 06:12:28,530
Unless you want to do something different.

6402
06:12:28,530 --> 06:12:34,970
I mean, we can see, but like, I'm more worried about Mantis
than Ultron.

6403
06:12:37,190 --> 06:12:38,610
Yeah, he's gonna be with this map.

6404
06:12:39,510 --> 06:12:39,730
True.

6405
06:12:39,990 --> 06:12:40,610
But we can just see.

6406
06:12:40,630 --> 06:12:41,650
This is a crazy weird map.

6407
06:12:42,610 --> 06:12:42,870
Yeah.

6408
06:12:43,210 --> 06:12:43,550
Yeah.

6409
06:12:43,750 --> 06:12:44,390
That's fine then.

6410
06:12:45,170 --> 06:12:45,890
Could be a Mantis.

6411
06:12:50,270 --> 06:12:51,570
We'll see what they're doing.

6412
06:12:54,990 --> 06:12:58,570
Do you guys want to first pro- We'll stop going in for fan
funds, actually, and soon.

6413
06:13:00,010 --> 06:13:00,710
Yeah, it is.

6414
06:13:01,250 --> 06:13:02,570
Yeah, that is like...

6415
06:13:03,510 --> 06:13:08,650
Because they get like legendary on DPS instead, and that's
like tier 2 DPS, tier 2 support player, right?

6416
06:13:08,670 --> 06:13:10,150
So it's kind of fucking cooked.

6417
06:13:10,390 --> 06:13:10,650
Yeah.

6418
06:13:10,650 --> 06:13:11,950
It's like they got an extra power player.

6419
06:13:14,510 --> 06:13:18,010
Yeah, legendary on support was like 10 times more doable
than him on DPS.

6420
06:13:19,570 --> 06:13:20,010
Yeah.

6421
06:13:21,970 --> 06:13:22,990
Oh, well, we still won.

6422
06:13:23,810 --> 06:13:24,110
Let's go.

6423
06:13:24,370 --> 06:13:25,490
Yeah, no, we got this.

6424
06:13:26,570 --> 06:13:27,370
This is Bunder Crunch.

6425
06:13:27,670 --> 06:13:28,510
Best believe.

6426
06:13:30,650 --> 06:13:31,030
Okay.

6427
06:13:32,350 --> 06:13:34,790
You're able to do something more fun to slow me now.

6428
06:13:43,140 --> 06:13:47,180
My hee-haha-oh-shee is no longer hee-haha-ha.

6429
06:13:48,940 --> 06:13:50,660
Really pain and suffering.

6430
06:13:52,140 --> 06:13:55,160
Bro, I'm tempted to be like, sub me out, get Saipa in here.

6431
06:13:55,760 --> 06:13:56,580
At least I'll make the team.

6432
06:13:56,600 --> 06:14:03,400
team's fair I just said that I'll be like go sub me out for
site pay right now

6433
06:14:06,480 --> 06:14:18,020
to protect them you can keep my money I don't need it yeah
not burst but yeah yeah okay so hello first good with that

6434
06:14:18,020 --> 06:14:30,440
everyone yeah that's fine okay hello and then I was going to
first ban Gambit.

6435
06:14:30,860 --> 06:14:33,740
If they don't first ban Gambit, we could save Gambit too.

6436
06:14:34,540 --> 06:14:34,840
I agree.

6437
06:14:44,490 --> 06:14:44,670
Wow.

6438
06:14:45,190 --> 06:14:46,670
No, they first ban Gambit.

6439
06:14:47,110 --> 06:14:47,810
Yeah, they banned it.

6440
06:14:50,530 --> 06:14:54,150
I think you save Sue here.

6441
06:14:56,010 --> 06:14:56,310
Alright.

6442
06:15:04,220 --> 06:15:05,760
Money, money, money.

6443
06:15:07,020 --> 06:15:08,500
It must be funny.

6444
06:15:09,700 --> 06:15:14,120
Okay, we save Sue and I think you've found Mantis.

6445
06:15:14,540 --> 06:15:16,060
Sounds good.

6446
06:15:16,940 --> 06:15:19,720
Mew, meew, meew.

6447
06:15:25,350 --> 06:15:27,170
I'm not assuming Mag be better at luck.

6448
06:15:27,550 --> 06:15:29,030
Do we lose because of bads?

6449
06:15:30,450 --> 06:15:31,350
Not my fault.

6450
06:15:31,530 --> 06:15:32,070
Do they play Groot?

6451
06:15:32,830 --> 06:15:33,810
Not my problem.

6452
06:15:33,910 --> 06:15:34,630
Yeah, they just play it.

6453
06:15:36,690 --> 06:15:38,890
They just win for a little bit.

6454
06:15:40,030 --> 06:15:40,170
Yeah.

6455
06:15:40,730 --> 06:15:41,530
Do we play Groot?

6456
06:15:43,970 --> 06:15:46,310
If you don't want to, I can just play Garuda and you can
play Rogue.

6457
06:15:47,310 --> 06:15:49,030
Yeah, I think we did that.

6458
06:15:50,270 --> 06:15:50,530
Okay.

6459
06:15:52,970 --> 06:15:54,350
I would have gone for a second to protect.

6460
06:15:56,410 --> 06:15:58,790
Hold on, let them do their thing first.

6461
06:16:08,500 --> 06:16:11,620
I can be, I should be able to be like emergency sub.

6462
06:16:12,720 --> 06:16:13,660
Get me out.

6463
06:16:14,900 --> 06:16:17,720
It looks like they just want to play like super front to
back, no?

6464
06:16:20,320 --> 06:16:34,020
yeah yeah bro the tournament game didn't start until yeah
okay 1 p.m we had i think we we had our first game at 11 or

6465
06:16:34,020 --> 06:16:41,400
12 p.m i don't know we don't need to yeah i should be able
to tap out i don't want to deal with it i feel like it's

6466
06:16:41,400 --> 06:16:49,940
good and uh because i 11 or 12 p.m when we had first game so
i got up early for no you can do a lot of things we can do

6467
06:16:49,940 --> 06:16:58,260
ultra we can do starlord that's up to you i think i think
i'll try i think we ran it i think so yeah we've always been

6468
06:16:58,260 --> 06:17:07,380
enjoying no channel too much low gremlin enables both the
dps to do too much i think yeah i agree to win this one.

6469
06:17:10,360 --> 06:17:12,540
Do you want to rock it again, Dukue?

6470
06:17:13,700 --> 06:17:15,760
If it's rock, sure, sure.

6471
06:17:16,760 --> 06:17:19,160
Is it rocket two or what?

6472
06:17:21,000 --> 06:17:21,980
Yeah, probably.

6473
06:17:25,660 --> 06:17:28,800
Actually, I think you play two.

6474
06:17:29,480 --> 06:17:30,060
All right.

6475
06:17:30,320 --> 06:17:32,760
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

6476
06:17:33,560 --> 06:17:35,180
You can tell I'm dead inside.

6477
06:17:37,740 --> 06:17:40,120
Interacting with my stupid stuff.

6478
06:17:41,820 --> 06:17:43,160
I'm like, all right.

6479
06:17:47,120 --> 06:17:51,080
The light gone from her eyes.

6480
06:17:53,500 --> 06:17:54,580
You can chain the dashes.

6481
06:17:55,060 --> 06:17:58,520
You can E and shift up to them or you can shift and then E.

6482
06:17:58,900 --> 06:18:01,160
At least we weren't the first team eliminated.

6483
06:18:03,120 --> 06:18:06,260
Let's, um, try what they have and we can make it.

6484
06:18:06,280 --> 06:18:16,960
guys we are technically better than site bay if they're
playing like we survived longer than site base team guys and

6485
06:18:16,960 --> 06:18:19,400

6487
06:18:36,280 --> 06:18:36,600
Hawkeye.

6488
06:18:38,680 --> 06:18:39,340
I'm breaking Colonial.

6489
06:18:39,460 --> 06:18:39,740
I'm walking.

6490
06:18:40,000 --> 06:18:41,580
Three, two, one.

6491
06:18:42,740 --> 06:18:43,320
Rogue on me.

6492
06:18:43,480 --> 06:18:43,820
Rogue on me.

6493
06:18:44,000 --> 06:18:44,520
He's going to big wall.

6494
06:18:44,840 --> 06:18:45,200
He's walled.

6495
06:18:45,280 --> 06:18:45,540
He's walled.

6496
06:18:45,600 --> 06:18:45,900
He's walled.

6497
06:18:45,960 --> 06:18:46,260
He's walled.

6498
06:18:46,480 --> 06:18:46,840
Nice.

6499
06:18:47,220 --> 06:18:47,680
Big walled.

6500
06:18:47,680 --> 06:18:52,760
Walking in three, two, one.

6501
06:18:52,960 --> 06:18:53,260
I'm walking.

6502
06:18:53,940 --> 06:18:54,600
Walking, Lesser.

6503
06:18:55,320 --> 06:18:55,720
Good swat.

6504
06:18:55,780 --> 06:18:56,140
Good swat.

6505
06:18:56,240 --> 06:18:56,720
Half HP.

6506
06:18:57,220 --> 06:18:58,120
I'm still walking in big wall.

6507
06:18:58,200 --> 06:18:59,020
I'm big walling.

6508
06:18:59,180 --> 06:18:59,280
I'm big walling.

6509
06:18:59,440 --> 06:18:59,800
I'm chilling.

6510
06:19:00,140 --> 06:19:00,980
I'm chilling.

6511
06:19:01,220 --> 06:19:01,480
I'm chilling.

6512
06:19:02,280 --> 06:19:02,860
They use their big wall.

6513
06:19:02,980 --> 06:19:03,640
We can hold the space.

6514
06:19:04,040 --> 06:19:05,660
Their Hawkeye is right side.

6515
06:19:06,280 --> 06:19:07,580
I'm checking in.

6516
06:19:07,900 --> 06:19:08,620
Watch ball, watch ball.

6517
06:19:09,240 --> 06:19:09,740
I'm dead.

6518
06:19:10,060 --> 06:19:11,060
Wait, there's the Phoenix.

6519
06:19:12,300 --> 06:19:13,480
It's got to be separated, separate.

6520
06:19:14,080 --> 06:19:14,200
Wow.

6521
06:19:15,060 --> 06:19:16,120
They're good swapping, no big one.

6522
06:19:16,320 --> 06:19:17,540
I have two tanks on me.

6523
06:19:18,000 --> 06:19:18,580
I have two tanks on me.

6524
06:19:18,720 --> 06:19:20,160
Yeah, we're trying our best.

6525
06:19:22,060 --> 06:19:22,960
I have ult for now.

6526
06:19:27,060 --> 06:19:28,260
I have my ult.

6527
06:19:32,380 --> 06:19:34,320
We can just play to get our Hawkeye off mid-fight.

6528
06:19:34,760 --> 06:19:36,260
Yeah, I can use my ult to get their support.

6529
06:19:36,280 --> 06:19:39,040
We can have better support ults and better DPS ults later.

6530
06:19:39,180 --> 06:19:39,380
Yep.

6531
06:19:39,680 --> 06:19:40,520
You out first, okay?

6532
06:19:40,680 --> 06:19:40,960
Okay.

6533
06:19:42,100 --> 06:19:42,840
Just go for it.

6534
06:19:43,160 --> 06:19:44,080
Try and hold it as much as you can.

6535
06:19:45,580 --> 06:19:46,760
I'm breaking clone and I'm walking.

6536
06:19:47,700 --> 06:19:48,180
He's walking, right?

6537
06:19:48,180 --> 06:19:49,260
Grit swap, grit swap, grit swap.

6538
06:19:49,680 --> 06:19:50,220
That's big one.

6539
06:19:51,240 --> 06:19:51,900
Yeah, fuck guy.

6540
06:19:52,020 --> 06:19:52,880
We should be fine, right?

6541
06:19:52,900 --> 06:19:53,540
I'm all in for myself.

6542
06:19:53,660 --> 06:19:54,880
I'm grabbing them, I'm grabbing them.

6543
06:19:55,080 --> 06:19:55,540
It's a pretty good.

6544
06:19:56,640 --> 06:19:56,940
Okay.

6545
06:19:57,380 --> 06:19:57,920
I'm trying to live.

6546
06:19:58,060 --> 06:19:58,440
I'm trying to live.

6547
06:19:58,460 --> 06:19:58,860
Chill, chill, chill.

6548
06:19:59,380 --> 06:19:59,980
I'm trying to punch.

6549
06:20:00,360 --> 06:20:02,500
Oh, you guys are trying to save you?

6550
06:20:02,500 --> 06:20:02,980
We can still win.

6551
06:20:03,100 --> 06:20:03,500
We can still win.

6552
06:20:03,920 --> 06:20:04,420
I couldn't.

6553
06:20:04,520 --> 06:20:05,200
I got his shot.

6554
06:20:06,280 --> 06:20:07,680
We can still win.

6555
06:20:09,280 --> 06:20:10,120
It's both are supportive.

6556
06:20:10,520 --> 06:20:11,120
I'm trying to get out.

6557
06:20:11,360 --> 06:20:12,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6558
06:20:13,520 --> 06:20:14,500
He's not stopping TP.

6559
06:20:16,740 --> 06:20:17,660
He's gonna be late.

6560
06:20:17,920 --> 06:20:18,360
We play fast.

6561
06:20:20,460 --> 06:20:21,040
I have a wall.

6562
06:20:22,880 --> 06:20:23,520
I'm walking.

6563
06:20:23,680 --> 06:20:23,940
I'm walking.

6564
06:20:24,100 --> 06:20:24,460
I can walk.

6565
06:20:24,560 --> 06:20:24,840
I can walk.

6566
06:20:25,140 --> 06:20:25,560
I'm walking.

6567
06:20:25,920 --> 06:20:26,460
I'm walking.

6568
06:20:26,660 --> 06:20:26,900
Grit's back.

6569
06:20:27,480 --> 06:20:28,380
He's big wall and small walls.

6570
06:20:28,980 --> 06:20:29,200
Look at her.

6571
06:20:29,280 --> 06:20:29,680
Look at the rogue.

6572
06:20:29,820 --> 06:20:30,100
Look at the rogue.

6573
06:20:30,220 --> 06:20:31,480
The rogue is like trolling.

6574
06:20:32,020 --> 06:20:32,640
There's a Hawkeye.

6575
06:20:32,860 --> 06:20:34,620
I pulled Hawkeye down, but he's coming.

6576
06:20:34,880 --> 06:20:35,040
Yeah.

6577
06:20:36,300 --> 06:20:37,480
Rogus and half HP.

6578
06:20:37,540 --> 06:20:38,100
Rogus all.

6579
06:20:38,560 --> 06:20:39,040
Rogus all.

6580
06:20:39,160 --> 06:20:39,640
Rogus all.

6581
06:20:39,720 --> 06:20:40,200
Rog.

6582
06:20:40,940 --> 06:20:41,580
I'm blocking.

6583
06:20:42,000 --> 06:20:42,220
I'm blocking.

6584
06:20:42,760 --> 06:20:43,340
He's low.

6585
06:20:43,800 --> 06:20:43,900
He's low.

6586
06:20:43,920 --> 06:20:44,980
Grit's one.

6587
06:20:46,880 --> 06:20:47,760
I'm only heals.

6588
06:20:48,360 --> 06:20:48,580
They're low.

6589
06:20:49,880 --> 06:20:50,360
Nice.

6590
06:20:52,340 --> 06:20:53,160
They're TPing now.

6591
06:20:54,120 --> 06:20:54,700
Carry the TP and pipe.

6592
06:20:54,780 --> 06:20:55,880
Yeah, we can stay on point and they can't.

6593
06:20:55,880 --> 06:20:57,060
They're off the portal three for us.

6594
06:20:58,260 --> 06:20:59,100
They don't have time.

6595
06:20:59,260 --> 06:21:00,240
Oh my gosh, Rookie.

6596
06:21:00,500 --> 06:21:00,800
Nice.

6597
06:21:01,200 --> 06:21:03,420
I pushed him off the portal accidentally.

6598
06:21:04,800 --> 06:21:05,040
Nice.

6599
06:21:05,260 --> 06:21:05,900
Good job, Rookie.

6600
06:21:08,600 --> 06:21:09,680
I'm walking on them here.

6601
06:21:10,080 --> 06:21:10,540
I grabbed them.

6602
06:21:10,620 --> 06:21:10,920
I grabbed them.

6603
06:21:10,940 --> 06:21:12,940
There's like someone, there's a rope behind us.

6604
06:21:12,960 --> 06:21:13,620
There's a rope behind us.

6605
06:21:13,620 --> 06:21:14,740
Phoenix is top right.

6606
06:21:15,620 --> 06:21:15,820
Phoenix is top right.

6607
06:21:15,820 --> 06:21:16,800
Yeah, Phoenix is top right.

6608
06:21:16,800 --> 06:21:17,720
I'm going to grab them top right.

6609
06:21:17,800 --> 06:21:18,280
I grab them.

6610
06:21:18,300 --> 06:21:19,000
I grab Phoenix.

6611
06:21:19,340 --> 06:21:20,080
It's one, it's one.

6612
06:21:20,420 --> 06:21:20,900
I can catch a man.

6613
06:21:21,000 --> 06:21:21,480
I can catch a man.

6614
06:21:21,700 --> 06:21:22,300
I need care behind you.

6615
06:21:24,340 --> 06:21:24,800
He's right here, right here.

6616
06:21:24,800 --> 06:21:25,060
I'm looking at him.

6617
06:21:25,200 --> 06:21:25,540
I'm looking at him.

6618
06:21:25,760 --> 06:21:26,420
Rogue is still trapped.

6619
06:21:26,880 --> 06:21:27,580
Can we chill?

6620
06:21:27,740 --> 06:21:27,980
Can we chill?

6621
06:21:28,260 --> 06:21:28,620
You know what?

6622
06:21:28,620 --> 06:21:28,920
I'm chilling.

6623
06:21:29,400 --> 06:21:29,680
I'm chilling.

6624
06:21:30,100 --> 06:21:31,840
Yeah, I'm walking.

6625
06:21:32,080 --> 06:21:32,460
I'm walking.

6626
06:21:32,660 --> 06:21:32,980
I'm walking.

6627
06:21:37,980 --> 06:21:38,600
Rogue is out.

6628
06:21:38,820 --> 06:21:39,020
Rogue is out.

6629
06:21:39,340 --> 06:21:40,120
Rogue is one.

6630
06:21:40,520 --> 06:21:41,340
I'm walking a big wall.

6631
06:21:41,540 --> 06:21:42,260

06:28:06,730 --> 06:28:09,610
Yeah, we couldn't get it.

6831
06:28:12,810 --> 06:28:13,850
Come on.

6832
06:28:14,010 --> 06:28:14,350
I'm good.

6833
06:28:15,970 --> 06:28:16,930
Let's go push.

6834
06:28:18,070 --> 06:28:22,110
The current score is 0-0.

6835
06:28:25,030 --> 06:28:25,630
Time to switch.

6836
06:28:26,470 --> 06:28:28,690
Hey, winner bull.

6837
06:28:30,070 --> 06:28:32,830
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

6838
06:28:32,970 --> 06:28:34,830
We got this.

6839
06:28:36,570 --> 06:28:39,050
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

6840
06:28:40,990 --> 06:28:41,670
Are you okay?

6841
06:28:41,830 --> 06:28:43,310
I'm just playing the game, buddy.

6842
06:28:43,550 --> 06:28:45,130
I'm just...

6843
06:28:45,130 --> 06:28:46,470
I can actually try midnight.

6844
06:28:47,010 --> 06:28:48,150
Come on, I think it could be good.

6845
06:28:48,390 --> 06:28:50,070
I'm just...

6846
06:28:50,070 --> 06:28:51,550
That was a time of attraction.

6847
06:28:51,990 --> 06:28:53,210
There's no other thinking.

6848
06:28:53,610 --> 06:28:55,610
It's just muscle memory now.

6849
06:28:56,270 --> 06:28:56,470
Yeah.

6850
06:28:59,410 --> 06:29:01,850
I'm just playing the game.

6851
06:29:13,030 --> 06:29:14,350
They talk wide.

6852
06:29:14,490 --> 06:29:15,850
Oh, it's because they bad-gabbit.

6853
06:29:16,330 --> 06:29:19,690
I'm just doing my volunteer work.

6854
06:29:21,310 --> 06:29:25,730
I have heard that your natural abilities have caused you
much strife over here.

6855
06:29:25,830 --> 06:29:26,670
It's all reflex.

6856
06:29:27,030 --> 06:29:27,750
True enough.

6857
06:29:28,170 --> 06:29:30,610
My mutant powers ain't exactly...

6858
06:29:38,950 --> 06:29:41,390
When I say that skin, I think it's strange.

6859
06:29:42,690 --> 06:29:44,070
It is kind of similar.

6860
06:29:48,430 --> 06:29:52,410
I'm going to let them walk a little bit, and then I'm going
to swing on point where the point hits the corner.

6861
06:29:53,730 --> 06:29:54,650
Yeah, I'm swinging.

6862
06:29:56,530 --> 06:29:59,290
I'm swinging in three, two, one.

6863
06:29:59,510 --> 06:30:00,330
I'm under tanks.

6864
06:30:00,530 --> 06:30:01,070
Tanks are half.

6865
06:30:01,650 --> 06:30:02,390
I'm grabbing Groot.

6866
06:30:02,750 --> 06:30:03,050
We walk?

6867
06:30:03,050 --> 06:30:03,550
Yeah, I'm walling him.

6868
06:30:03,610 --> 06:30:04,010
I'm walling him.

6869
06:30:04,190 --> 06:30:04,690
Yeah, he's half.

6870
06:30:04,810 --> 06:30:05,070
He's half.

6871
06:30:05,310 --> 06:30:05,590
Big wall.

6872
06:30:05,670 --> 06:30:06,050
Carry the big wall.

6873
06:30:06,150 --> 06:30:07,950
Uh, Kerwals, yeah.

6874
06:30:08,950 --> 06:30:10,350
Okay, their turn, their turn.

6875
06:30:10,490 --> 06:30:12,070
Watch top left, top left, top guy, top left.

6876
06:30:12,650 --> 06:30:13,930
I'm on a stop point, I'm on a stop point.

6877
06:30:14,050 --> 06:30:15,070
3, 2, 1.

6878
06:30:15,170 --> 06:30:15,630
Source out.

6879
06:30:16,670 --> 06:30:17,630
DPS are low, DPS are low.

6880
06:30:18,270 --> 06:30:20,150
I need someone at a contest top.

6881
06:30:21,370 --> 06:30:22,250
They're walking hard on me.

6882
06:30:22,270 --> 06:30:23,610
Oh, you're wild, you're wild, you're wild.

Okay, top.

6886
06:30:29,790 --> 06:30:30,510
Can we get TP?

6887
06:30:31,150 --> 06:30:32,090
Yeah, I can TP back.

6888
06:30:32,190 --> 06:30:32,670

6889
06:30:32,830 --> 06:30:33,270

There's three, two, one.

6894
06:30:45,650 --> 06:30:47,390
There is a Phoenix on from beside you.

6895

Did we go?

6904
06:31:01,210 --> 06:31:02,350
There's a Phoenix to the right too.

6905
06:31:02,410 --> 06:31:03,330

I'm dead.

6962
06:32:55,090 --> 06:32:56,070
We can start walking slowly.

Can you check?

6974
06:33:09,570 --> 06:33:10,650
We don't need a match.

6975
06:33:11,490 --> 06:33:12,130

06:33:23,170 --> 06:33:24,090

I copy.

6996
06:33:40,050 --> 06:33:40,710

6997
06:33:40,830 --> 06:33:41,370
He copied him.

6998
06:33:41,530 --> 06:33:41,970
He copied him.

6999
06:33:42,450 --> 06:33:42,690
Phoenix one.

7000
06:33:42,750 --> 06:33:42,970
Fix one.

7001
06:33:43,110 --> 06:33:43,250
Nice.

7002
06:33:43,630 --> 06:33:44,090
Walk up.

06:33:44,250 --> 06:33:45,390
Walk up.

7004
06:33:45,670 --> 06:33:47,550
I pulled her back.

7005
06:33:49,550 --> 06:33:50,710
I don't want to get headshot though.

7006
06:33:51,210 --> 06:33:51,430
He goes.

7007
06:33:53,050 --> 06:33:53,930
They don't have support.

7008
06:33:54,130 --> 06:33:55,370
They use both support.

7009
06:33:58,490 --> 06:34:00,210
They're gonna have Hawkeye Rogue.

7010
06:34:00,890 --> 06:34:02,150
Yeah, we need to just stop.

7011
06:34:02,190 --> 06:34:02,950
Oh, he swapped the Hawkeye.

7012
06:34:03,090 --> 06:34:03,770
He's playing Monet now.

7013
06:34:04,570 --> 06:34:05,010
I don't know.

7014
06:34:05,450 --> 06:34:07,150
End of playing, Grets.

7015
06:34:07,830 --> 06:34:08,790
Just keep stuffing.

7016
06:34:09,210 --> 06:34:11,130
Ok, I'm going to wait for their push and then go second
okay.

7017
06:34:11,650 --> 06:34:11,870
Good, good, good, good.

7018
06:34:11,870 --> 06:34:12,190
Good with you, good with you.

7019
06:34:12,330 --> 06:34:12,410
His water.

7020
06:34:13,750 --> 06:34:14,350
Oh, I couldn't pull.

7021
06:34:14,830 --> 06:34:16,070
You guys good?

7022
06:34:16,210 --> 06:34:16,650
He got beer.

7023
06:34:16,650 --> 06:34:17,710
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

7024
06:34:17,710 --> 06:34:18,650
I am, I am.

7025
06:34:20,990 --> 06:34:22,730
Just that point, that point, that point, that point, that
point, that point.

7026
06:34:23,450 --> 06:34:23,990
I'm 74.

7027
06:34:29,890 --> 06:34:30,870
Yeah, we almost have two olds.

7028
06:34:31,590 --> 06:34:31,830
It's okay.

7029
06:34:34,610 --> 06:34:35,110
It's clear.

7030
06:34:35,410 --> 06:34:36,130
I still need it here.

7031
06:34:36,450 --> 06:34:36,910
Stop them!

7032
06:34:36,910 --> 06:34:39,050
I don't think we are less so it, I don't think we...

7033
06:34:39,050 --> 06:34:39,370
I don't think...

7034
06:34:39,370 --> 06:34:40,370
Yeah, we have to go right, yeah.

7035
06:34:40,710 --> 06:34:41,270
We can go right so...

7036
06:34:41,270 --> 06:34:42,950
They're close to...

7037
06:34:42,950 --> 06:34:44,630
They're gonna have both the DPS, okay?

7038
06:34:45,410 --> 06:34:46,690
Yeah, they might try to walk out early.

7039
06:34:47,850 --> 06:34:49,010
Yeah, we need to walk without them.

7040
06:34:49,990 --> 06:34:50,910
I think I...

7041
06:34:51,450 --> 06:34:52,350
My next one behind us without.

7042
06:34:52,790 --> 06:34:54,050
I'm gonna try and flank, I think.

7043
06:34:54,150 --> 06:34:54,730
The rogue is above.

7044
06:34:54,790 --> 06:34:55,750
The rogue is looking for something.

7045
06:34:56,010 --> 06:34:56,690
I'm walking on the rogue.

7046
06:34:56,790 --> 06:34:57,690
The rogue is going up for something.

7047
06:34:57,790 --> 06:34:58,670
He's alting, he's alting, he's alting.

7048
06:34:59,150 --> 06:34:59,830
Yeah, you got my...

7049
06:34:59,830 --> 06:35:00,990
You got my alting.

7050
06:35:01,410 --> 06:35:02,510
I can't touch, I can't touch.

7051
06:35:02,890 --> 06:35:03,630
I can't touch after you.

7052
06:35:03,890 --> 06:35:03,910
I can't do anything.

7053
06:35:04,690 --> 06:35:05,650
Yeah, I'm all in for you.

7054
06:35:06,390 --> 06:35:07,230
That's Monnet on point.

7055
06:35:07,910 --> 06:35:08,990
I'm trying to get the mega right side.

7056
06:35:10,390 --> 06:35:10,890
I can't touch.

7057
06:35:11,250 --> 06:35:11,630
I can touch it.

7058
06:35:11,690 --> 06:35:14,730
Monnet on point.

7059
06:35:15,610 --> 06:35:16,210
He's one.

7060
06:35:17,110 --> 06:35:19,230
Oh, I can't touch.

7061
06:35:23,630 --> 06:35:27,610
We can stop them for a little bit here with my opt.

7062
06:35:28,010 --> 06:35:28,070
Yep.

7063
06:35:29,710 --> 06:35:38,190
This rogue and Monnet and Phoenix they have copy, probably
double supports and group.

7064
06:35:38,190 --> 06:35:38,590
Group midnight.

7065
06:35:39,350 --> 06:35:39,990
Copy it.

7066
06:35:41,730 --> 06:35:42,370
Rogue's playing close.

7067
06:35:42,670 --> 06:35:43,670
You have ult first here.

7068
06:35:43,950 --> 06:35:44,350
I'm with you.

7069
06:35:44,350 --> 06:35:44,530
I'm with you.

7070
06:35:44,710 --> 06:35:44,770
Ready?

7071
06:35:45,050 --> 06:35:46,350
Three, two, one.

7072
06:35:46,490 --> 06:35:46,810
I'm balling.

7073
06:35:47,130 --> 06:35:47,950
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke.

7074
06:35:48,230 --> 06:35:48,730
I'm grabbing Rode.

7075
06:35:48,910 --> 06:35:50,870
I'm gonna marry this.

7076
06:35:50,990 --> 06:35:51,370
I'm marrying it.

7077
06:35:51,430 --> 06:35:51,870
I'm waiting for it.

7078
06:35:52,570 --> 06:35:53,930
Yeah, yeah, I'm close.

7079
06:35:55,550 --> 06:35:56,730
No one's going to grab this left.

7080
06:35:56,810 --> 06:35:57,390
I'm grabbing the bluff.

7081
06:35:57,510 --> 06:35:57,990
I grabbed for you.

7082
06:35:58,190 --> 06:35:58,470
It's big.

7083
06:35:58,590 --> 06:35:58,750
It's big.

7084
06:35:58,930 --> 06:36:00,410
So we can see it.

7085
06:36:02,090 --> 06:36:02,730
Got one.

7086
06:36:02,790 --> 06:36:03,370
I can't see you.

7087
06:36:03,470 --> 06:36:03,750
I can't see you.

7088
06:36:03,750 --> 06:36:04,110
I'm on back lane.

7089
06:36:04,150 --> 06:36:04,550
I'm on back lane.

7090
06:36:05,650 --> 06:36:07,650
I'm going on point on one point on one point.

7091
06:36:10,310 --> 06:36:11,910
Coming back on cap.

7092
06:36:12,390 --> 06:36:13,050
I have nothing to copy.

7093
06:36:17,150 --> 06:36:18,050
They're gonna come me through.

7094
06:36:18,610 --> 06:36:21,110
I can touch, I can touch, I can touch, I can touch, I can
touch, I can touch.

7095
06:36:21,650 --> 06:36:22,030
One eight south.

7096
06:36:22,090 --> 06:36:22,410
Okay, one.

7097
06:36:22,810 --> 06:36:23,890
One eight south, top right.

7098
06:36:24,030 --> 06:36:24,570
One eight south, top right.

7099
06:36:29,040 --> 06:36:30,060
Clark, nice try.

7100
06:36:31,320 --> 06:36:32,660
GG's, GG's, GG's.

7101
06:36:33,700 --> 06:36:34,580
GG's, nice try.

7102
06:36:36,000 --> 06:36:37,380
NT, NT was fun though.

7103
06:36:40,760 --> 06:36:41,480
DGs.

7104
06:36:41,840 --> 06:36:42,240
DGs.

7105
06:36:42,940 --> 06:36:43,460
DGs.

7106
06:36:43,520 --> 06:36:44,220
DGs.

7107
06:36:44,280 --> 06:36:44,940
It's okay.

7108
06:36:45,400 --> 06:36:47,240
I can nap for one hour.

7109
06:36:51,280 --> 06:36:52,600
Oh my god, we're free.

7110
06:36:53,320 --> 06:36:53,920
It's okay.

7111
06:36:53,960 --> 06:36:55,040
There's no day two.

7112
06:36:55,940 --> 06:36:58,060
There's no day two.

7113
06:37:02,500 --> 06:37:04,100
There's no day two.

7114
06:37:05,640 --> 06:37:06,360

Oh my god, that was a seven...

7125
06:37:25,740 --> 06:37:28,620
That was almost a seven hour stream.

7126
06:37:29,780 --> 06:37:31,720
Oh my god.

7127
06:37:32,300 --> 06:37:33,360

because you deserve it I'll see you guys next time everyone

7136
06:39:03,140 --> 06:39:14,300
no stream tomorrow yay I'm sorry I did try I tried my best,
but I'm absolutely exhausted at that point.

7137
06:39:14,380 --> 06:39:15,360
I was running on fumes.

7138
06:39:15,540 --> 06:39:18,160
I might have been making, like, really bad decisions.

7139
06:39:18,580 --> 06:39:24,620
But at that point, I was, I'm pretty sure, like, half the EU
players, I'm pretty sure, like, Riggsie was running on fumes

7140
06:39:24,620 --> 06:39:26,100
because he was not talking anymore.

7141
06:39:28,140 --> 06:39:31,660
Yeah, I'm pretty sure half the EU players were so fucking
tired.

7142
06:39:32,000 --> 06:39:35,260
And, like, I was really tired because I had to wake up so
early, too.

7143
06:39:36,500 --> 06:39:37,460
So, no stream.

7144
06:39:37,680 --> 06:39:39,460
Yeah, it was just...

7145
06:39:39,480 --> 06:39:48,240
My only, my biggest critique is that they should have, they
should have, you know, organized the better.

7146
06:39:51,740 --> 06:39:54,440
They really should have, yeah.

7147
06:39:59,740 --> 06:40:02,000
Um, um, anyway, I'm going to head off now.

7148
06:40:02,180 --> 06:40:02,760
Bye, everyone.

7149
06:40:03,240 --> 06:40:05,460
I got, I'm going to take a one hour nap.

7150
06:40:05,620 --> 06:40:10,560
Yeah, going on and off adrenaline was not, I think that's
why I have a headache too, because I, lock in and then lock

7151
06:40:10,560 --> 06:40:17,700
out and then lock in and lock out yeah there's just way too
much downtime for what they did for how they got the they

7152
06:40:17,700 --> 06:40:24,860
got the fucking the the landcasters too they got the fucking
landcasters they got all the like really well-known players

7153
06:40:24,860 --> 06:40:32,100
and rivals in both like rivals and content creation but it
this just i don't understand why the downtime is like this i

7154
06:40:32,100 --> 06:40:39,600
don't understand like um how they organized it like that
like but it's okay like you live and Learn.

7155
06:40:39,800 --> 06:40:40,580
You live and learn.

7156
06:40:40,820 --> 06:40:45,380
But if I'm definitely, I don't know if I'll do that again.

7157
06:40:45,680 --> 06:40:47,520
All right.

7158
06:40:47,640 --> 06:40:48,200
See you guys.

7159
06:40:48,500 --> 06:40:49,160
