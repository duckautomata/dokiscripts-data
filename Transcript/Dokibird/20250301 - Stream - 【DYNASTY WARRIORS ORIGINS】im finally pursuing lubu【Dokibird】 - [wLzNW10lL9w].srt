1
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,770
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,150
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,210
If I sound really bad, then yes, I know.

4
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,310
My voice is still not recovered yet, so today will be a short stream.

5
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,190
But, I want to pursue Lu Bu.

6
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,410
Apparently, I was this close to finally pursuing Lu Bu.

7
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,970
And I was like, I'm going to do it this week.

8
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,690
I'm not canceling Dynasty Warriors again!

9
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,190
Because for some reason, every time I cancel a stream, it's Dynasty Warriors.

10
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,090
And I was like, okay, it'll be fine.

11
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,530
It'll be fi- We're gonna- We are gonna pursue that Lu Bu!

12
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,910
Finally!

13
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,850
It only took four streams to finally pursue him.

14
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,350
Oh my god.

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,180
So yes, if I have to, we just stop after pursuing him.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,380
But, like I said, I still want to stream for you guys.

17
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:09,620
I think after the Marvel Rivals Tournament, I will take a little bit- I will take two days off just to see if my voice heals a little bit and my cough gets a little better.

18
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,000
Because tomorrow, I do have a VTuber Rivals Tournament.

19
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,280
And it starts at 8am.

20
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,960
And then there's a Day 2.

21
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,360
So Day 2 will also start at 8am as well.

22
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,840
So that's why I was like, ah, fuck.

23
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,260
I usually have a rest day on Sunday.

24
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,040
But this time, I don't.

25
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,540
So I can't rest on Sunday, but most likely rest on Monday and Tuesday.

26
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,280
Also, I will be in the Disguised Toast VTuber- Not VTuber, sorry.

27
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,960
Disguised Toast Marvel Rivals Tournament again.

28
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,140
I just got invited, I think like two days ago.

29
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,640
And I dragged Surefour in with me as my other player.

30
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,100
Because I was like, oh yeah, it was possible.

31
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,140
Could I not have four to five support players on my team again?

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,260
I was like, oh my god, thank you so much for the invite.

33
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,120
I just have one thing I want to make sure.

34
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Is it okay if I'm a support main?

35
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,760
Yes, I know, I got top 500 as support.

36
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,640
But it's really rough.

37
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,800
It was really rough for me last time.

38
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,280
I really appreciate it if I could have players for each of the roles.

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,140
It would mean so much.

40
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,760
And then Tess was reassuring me that don't worry, it'll be different this time.

41
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,900
I won't have three to four support players.

42
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,480
Not three to four, more support players on my team.

43
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,840
And he also asked me who I wanted on my team.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,780
And he gave me a list of people who were already in the tournament.

45
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,400
And I saw Surefour was in the tournament.

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,540
Toast was like, okay, get someone that's around Eternity level.

47
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,260
Because I'm categorized as Celestia, thank god.

48
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,380
When I saw, because he gave me the player list.

49
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,760
Because it's not going to be randomized, by the way.

50
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,520
The tournament for Toast this time, it's next week.

51
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,420
By the way, the tournament is next week.

52
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,440
So like, it's going to be soon.

53
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,420
And then they're like, okay.

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,640
I saw and he's like, this is not going to be randomized.

55
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,260
So you can bring one duelist with you.

56
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,260
And I was just like, can I bring Surefour?

57
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,280
Because I'm technically Celestia.

58
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,100
Because I looked at the people they put as Eternity.

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,020
And I was like, there's no way.

60
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,560
I play as good as these people.

61
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,220
That are categorized as Eternity.

62
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,340
Because they're all like, ex-pros.

63
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,420
And I was like, there's no fucking way.

64
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,420
I was never signed in a tier one org.

65
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,340
There's no way I should be categorized as the Eternity player on my team.

66
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,260
I would feel so fucking bad.

67
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,500
Especially because the teams are not randomized.

68
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,040
I was like, can I be Celestia?

69
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,000
Please, can you categorize me as Celestia?

70
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,380
And the duelist was like, no, that's cool, it's fine.

71
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,320
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna be categorized as Celestia.

72
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,660
I was like, oh, thank God.

73
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,280
I was like, oh, thank fucking God.

74
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,640
Because I saw one person in that list.

75
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,020
I was like, that was categorized as Celestia.

76
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,400
And they were like, they were also a one above all support player.

77
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,200
And I was like, there's no fucking way.

78
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,130
If he can be Celestia, I should be Celestia.

79
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,510
I saw that, I saw that name.

80
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,370
I was like, there's no fucking way.

81
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,350
If he's Celestia, I should be Celestia.

82
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,030
I fucking fought against him in ranked all the time.

83
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,410
There's no way.

84
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,830
So I was like, that was my heart.

85
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,590
It's like, yeah, no, we are categorized as Celestia.

86
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,810
Oh, thank God.

87
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,970
Thank fucking God.

88
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,690
Yeah, so like, I was like, oh, thank God.

89
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,050
I was really happy about that.

90
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,230
I was really thankful too.

91
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,430
I'm really thankful to get another invite.

92
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,010
It really is a big opportunity.

93
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,710
I'm really happy that, you know, people are inviting me to these things.

94
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,790
So thank you so much to Toast for the invite.

95
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,250
I really look forward to next week.

96
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,690
The only person I know that's on my team is Shur4r because I dragged him into the tournament.

97
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:59,830
And then my rest of the teammates are going to be randomly assigned and stuff.

98
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,350
So we'll see.

99
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,810
I don't know who my teammates are, so we'll see how it goes.

100
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,710
Yeah, my voice is really fucked right now because I've been coughing the last week.

101
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,170
So basically, I'm at the puberty stage right now.

102
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,830
So that's where I'm at.

103
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,610
I hope Monday and Tuesday, it'll get a lot better.

104
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,310
I've just been perpetually sick the last year or so.

105
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,050
Eventually, it'll get better, right?

106
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,910
Eventually, right?

107
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,090
I can't be sick forever.

108
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,830
Oh yeah, by the way...

109
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,150
Um...

110
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,770
The Marvel Rivals devs personally reached out to me.

111
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,070
And that's all I can say.

112
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,150
Alright, also...

113
00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:00,790
You guys, during tomorrow, you're going to notice that I have a lot of Marvel Rivals currency.

114
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,390
But I didn't pay for it.

115
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,880
How did I obtain that currency?

116
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,340
I don't know.

117
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,290
So, maybe I can actually finally own skins?

118
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,650
God,

119
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,070
I love free stuff.

120
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,690
Uh...

121
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,190
Anyway...

122
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,650
Because you guys are going to see my currency on the top right tomorrow.

123
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,950
You're going to be like, what the fuck, Doki?

124
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,070
I thought you said you were never going to spend money on Marvel Rivals.

125
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,250
I didn't though.

126
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,510
I didn't spend money.

127
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,270
It's going to be a lie.

128
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,970
If you're going to see that, you're going to be like, what the f- I haven't spent any yet.

129
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:58,010
But you're going to see it, and then you're going to be like, what the f- I haven't spent any of it yet.

130
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,230
I don't know.

131
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,090
I haven't used skins in so long.

132
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,510
I haven't used any skins in a long time.

133
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,870
So, I was like, what skin do I even get?

134
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,330
Like, I hate the Luna Snow skins.

135
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,430
Personally, I'm not a fan of any of the Luna Snow skins.

136
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,450
So, I was like, none of them I really want to buy.

137
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,130
So, I was like, I don't know what to buy.

138
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,860
Even the new one?

139
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,780
I don't like her hair for the new one.

140
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
I think everything looks great, except for the hairstyle.

141
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm not a fan of the hairstyle for the Luna Snow skin.

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,640
So,

143
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,380
yeah, that's why I'm like, I don't know.

144
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,600
And then you're like, oh, what about the new skin that just came out?

145
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,700
What was it?

146
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,540
Magic and Hulk.

147
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,360
I don't play Magic or Hulk.

148
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,800
That's the thing.

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,040
Like, a lot of them, I don't play the characters.

150
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,240
So, it's like, what's the point of spending my free money on characters that I don't play?

151
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm going to see them on other players.

152
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,460
So, yeah, I don't know.

153
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,600
I'll figure it out.

154
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,640
Or maybe I'll just hoard it.

155
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,820
I'll hoard my free money until then.

156
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,820
Anyway, it's Dynasty Warriors.

157
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,280
Oh, yeah.

158
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,360
Dad update.

159
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,320
Today, I walked Dad today.

160
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,140
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

161
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm breathing heavily because I'm sick right now.

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,340
So, I'm at the breathing heavily stage because I talk too much.

163
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,220
Dad update.

164
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,860
I was walking, you know, as usual.

165
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,220
I was walking Dad.

166
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
And, you know, he was being...

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,420
Okay, so, this is just going to be a really short story.

168
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,200
But in the elevator, I walked Dad.

169
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,060
And obviously, you know, I was like, alright, elevator.

170
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,460
You know, let's go to the elevator.

171
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,280
And then there was a very pretty lady in the elevator.

172
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,680
A very pretty blonde white lady in the elevator.

173
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,740
And he freaked out.

174
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,220
You know what I mean by freaked out?

175
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,220
He, like, instantly, like, went up to her and was, like, whimpering.

176
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,380
He was, like, and, like, trying, like...

177
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,820
Like, he was, like, jump...

178
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,400
Like, not jumping, but, like, you know, he, like, jumped up to his legs and was, like...

179
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,860
And I'm, like, dude, every...

180
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,280
I was, like, you don't do that to me.

181
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,040
I was just, like...

182
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,320
That's a me.

183
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,750
That's a pretty lady.

184
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,110
And then, like, the girl was just, like, aw.

185
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,300
And I was just, like, please touch me.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,040
I was just, like, you...

187
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,820
I haven't seen him whimper or, like...

188
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,520
I haven't seen him whimper like that in so long.

189
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,740
I was so...

190
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,480
I was, like...

191
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,020
I was so surprised.

192
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,240
I was, like, oh, my God.

193
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,800
Like, you fucking whore.

194
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,340
You whore.

195
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,500
I can't believe it.

196
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,260
Anyway...

197
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,780
Yeah, he got a little too...

198
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,760
And his tail was wagging so much and everything.

199
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
And I'm just, like...

200
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, my God.

201
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,100
Restrain yourself.

202
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,560
Restrain yourself, Doki Amber Doge.

203
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,020
Restrain yourself.

204
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
We're in public.

205
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,300
We're...

206
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,380
Anyway...

207
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,820
That's my Doki Amber Doge story for today.

208
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,500
Alright, let's pursue Lupu.

209
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,300
Which one is it?

210
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,320
I believe it's this one.

211
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,220
It has to be that one.

212
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,260
And he's neutered, by the way.

213
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,200
I don't know where he's getting this testosterone.

214
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,360
He's fucking cut off his balls as a kid.

215
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
But, who knows how much longer it'll be around.

216
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,760
Alright, hello.

217
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,210
Yeah.

218
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,770
Oh, my God.

219
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,870
He has a secret role?

220
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,850
What?

221
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,690
Oh, wait.

222
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:37,970
I forgot.

223
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,330
I'm supposed to be left side Doki.

224
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,430
Give me a sec, guys.

225
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,550
Where is left side Doki even?

226
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,930
I don't remember.

227
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,750
Is it this one?

228
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,070
No, that's centered.

229
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,710
Nope.

230
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,070
Where is left side Doki?

231
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,930
Nope.

232
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,830
Okay, there we go.

233
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,610
Left side Doki.

234
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,510
I need to rename this.

235
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,950
Who are you, really?

236
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,660
Okay.

237
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,420
Whenever my voice gets better, I want to do a super long stream of this game.

238
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
I don't even think we're like 30% done.

239
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,080
Oh, wait.

240
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,440
That's me.

241
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,620
Wait, he knows who I am.

242
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
I'm the Guardians of Peace.

243
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,260
Oh, I'm an assassin?

244
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,720
Pretty fucking shitty assassin.

245
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,240
They all see my face and then they fall in love with me.

246
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,760
Wait, but if I'm like here for peace, then why am I killing people?

247
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,940
Unrecognized.

248
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm like the fucking Forsworn brother.

249
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,700
Wait, is this why I'm running out of history?

250
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,500
No!

251
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,220
They wrote me out of history!

252
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,780
Peace suits, man.

253
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,640
They deleted me!

254
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,770
Wait, she knew too?!

255
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,730
It's fucking over.

256
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,610
She already lied.

257
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,210
Oh my gosh, he kidnapped Diao Chan?

258
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:26,870
I will never be able to turn Diao Chan back into the girl she once was.

259
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,170
This cannot be her real lore.

260
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,670
This is like the first time I heard that Diao Chan is actually a fucking secret assassin.

261
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,370
Out of like nine other games.

262
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,160
I was like, she was never a fucking... what the fuck?

263
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,720
She was supposed...

264
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,920
She was just to be like, hot.

265
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,720
She was just supposed to be really, really fucking hot.

266
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,620
There's no way.

267
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,020
It was very well hidden.

268
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,300
She's not real in the first place.

269
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,700
She's real to me!

270
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,100
How dare you.

271
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,140
She's real to us!

272
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,620
My waifu is real.

273
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,980
And I'm going to need your help.

274
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,920
That's funny, they're like... she says all this and then she ends up marrying him.

275
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,780
What, burning down your fucking village?

276
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,140
Everything you've done for me, like killing my entire family.

277
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,670
Also, JL, thank you for the super chat.

278
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,150
Thank you, thank you.

279
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,370
24 hour stream of this game when you're recovered.

280
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,850
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

281
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,370
I want to do like six plus hours of this stream whenever I get better.

282
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,150
But thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

283
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,370
Antai, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

284
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,570
CP, I think they miswrote pieces.

285
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,450
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

286
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,690
Yeah, they do take a lot of like artistic liberty with the game.

287
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,170
But like, I'll still play the game regardless.

288
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,010
I'm going with you, I want to do it.

289
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,310
Where's the no option?

290
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,390
Okay.

291
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,410
Yes, where's the I would like to walk away?

292
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,050
Okay, I'm going with you.

293
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,850
I need to ask Yura and give them more money.

294
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,450
If I want to say no.

295
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,310
Why are you?

296
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,030
Why am I waiting?

297
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,790
Hello, Cao Cao.

298
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,950
Hello, Cao Cao.

299
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,870
Now he's a fucking child.

300
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,350
He's a Bishimen.

301
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,210
I know, it's just so- I think it's the first time I've seen him without like a beard.

302
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,970
It's so weird, he's just like Liu Bei, but evil.

303
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,550
Alright, assassination of Gan Jue.

304
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,290
Alright, it's time!

305
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,730
Wait, actually, let me double check really fast.

306
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,670
If I haven't- wait, what weapon am I using right now?

307
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,530
Okay, the Crim- yeah, I heard the Crimson Orchid was strong.

308
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,230
Uh, I want to make sure that I have everything I want to use.

309
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,450
Okay, alright, I'm ready.

310
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,450
It's time!

311
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,090
We are finally- we are finally pursuing Liu Bu!

312
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,670
I'm ready!

313
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm fucking ready.

314
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,630
I will come humbly before you.

315
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,170
Hmm...

316
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,350
I have but one question.

317
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,250
Are you loyal to the Han?

318
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,470
Or to Dong Zhou?

319
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,950
You are very forthright.

320
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,310
I feel many men have lost their heads for answering wrongly.

321
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,770
Answer already.

322
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,770
Oh, it's just like a what-if situation where like, we just killed- Cao Cao just dies.

323
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,650
They just kill him.

324
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,230
And then like, we just- it's just the cute two kingdoms.

325
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,310
And this is?

326
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,080
Diao Chan is my name.

327
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,520
You understand me well, Cao Cao.

328
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm inclined to accept.

329
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,700
Oh!

330
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,680
I mean like, don't they have guards?

331
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,760
Oh my god!

332
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,800
Okay, not gonna lie.

333
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,840
There's so many guards out there.

334
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,880
Like, I feel like they would have like, seen her pull the fucking- Oh my god, there he is!

335
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,180
Liu Bu!

336
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,620
Liu Bu!

337
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,880
I shall pursue you.

338
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,940
Oh shit.

339
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,000
Is she hot?

340
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
You can't kill her, she's your future wife.

341
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,370
Wait, he does look like Liu Bu.

342
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,870
Wait, he basically looks like Liu Bu, wait a minute.

343
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,750
Wait a minute.

344
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,710
They have the same fucking face.

345
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,670
Little bro.

346
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,630
Hey, that's my big brother, Liu Bu.

347
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,890
Alright, wait, that's how I'm pursuing him?

348
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,970
Alright.

349
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,550
I'm- I'm- Wait.

350
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,830
Wait.

351
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,150
Guys, all his attacks are- Guys.

352
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,230
Okay, I- I'm going to run.

353
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,870
Wait a minute.

354
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,450
Wait a minute.

355
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,410
Wait.

356
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,890
All his- Oh, wait a minute.

357
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,010
Why- Why is all his attacks red, guys?

358
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,330
Guys.

359
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,250
Why are all his attacks red?

360
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,110
Wait, I cannot dodge any of them?

361
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,170
Wait, what- What do you mean?

362
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,370
Okay.

363
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,270
Guys, I don't know if I win though.

364
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,090
And his invisible red armor.

365
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,170
He should totally pursue it.

366
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,990
Okay, guys, I'm a little worried.

367
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,710
I have a feeling that maybe I cannot pursue him.

368
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,190
But like, I can't tell yet, guys.

369
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,050
I can't tell.

370
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,470
Oh my god, oh my god, he's coming.

371
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,070
Oh my god, oh my god, he's right behind me, guys.

372
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,470
Oh my god.

373
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,210
Be cautious, Liu Bu is approaching.

374
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,130
Oh my god, oh my god.

375
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,250
He's coming, guys.

376
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,690
Oh my god, oh my god, he's right behind me.

377
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,550
He is, isn't he?

378
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,390
Guys, is he right behind me, guys?

379
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,730
Oh, fuck.

380
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,970
Guys, guys, I think he's right behind me, guys.

381
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,470
Oh, fuck.

382
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,470
Oh, fuck.

383
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,970
Oh my god, oh my god, I can't- I think he's right behind me.

384
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,470
Oh, I can see him right now.

385
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,050
Okay, it's okay.

386
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,630
It's okay.

387
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,910
We're fine.

388
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,470
Okay, let me look behind me real fast.

389
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,710
Okay, okay, we keep going.

390
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,210
Okay.

391
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,890
I thought you wanted to pursue Liu Bu.

392
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,770
Why are you running?

393
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,710
Oh my god, did you not see what he just do to me?

394
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,790
What do you mean?

395
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,290
Yes, everything was unblockable.

396
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,470
How do I kill something I can't fucking block, guys?

397
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,470
What do you want me to do?

398
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,590
I can't kill things I can't block.

399
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,330
Oh god.

400
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,670
He just died.

401
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:07,910
Okay.

402
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,530
Alright.

403
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,310
Just don't get hit.

404
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,190
Wow!

405
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,930
That seemed so fucking easy.

406
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:17,990
Okay.

407
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,090
Okay.

408
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,750
Okay, we can- We'll redo the fight.

409
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,910
First off...

410
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,890
I can't beat the shit out of you while getting closer.

411
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,590
Thank you for the super chat.

412
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,450
Thank you, thank you.

413
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,990
Where do we go?

414
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,650
Where do we go?

415
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,050
He's right behind us.

416
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,950
Guys, I'll- I swear, I'll swear, guys.

417
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,750
I swear I'll totally pursue him.

418
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,330
I swear to god.

419
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:00,950
Oh, it's this one.

420
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,830
I swear.

421
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,130
Oh no, oh no.

422
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:03,910
He's coming.

423
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:04,830
Oh no.

424
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,590
He's right behind us.

425
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,410
Oh my god, Cao Cao, quick.

426
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,290
Quick.

427
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,650
He's literally right behind us.

428
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,110
Quick.

429
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,850
Oh my god.

430
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,630
He's in the palace.

431
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,250
JK, thank you for the super chat.

432
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,550
Thank you.

433
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,650
Cao Cao, please.

434
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,630
Please.

435
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,650
He hit me twice and I almost died.

436
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,310
You know, I thought I'd have, you know.

437
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:41,210
I thought I could like, survive like, five hits.

438
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,810
But like, he literally hit me two times and I was ready to fucking just die.

439
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,610
Like...

440
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,550
Ancient Chinese generals and your pure mirror are closer than they appear.

441
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,610
Thank you for the super chat, Miyazaki.

442
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,550
Thank you.

443
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,410
Where's this guy?

444
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,850
Zeon, thank you for the super chat.

445
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,570
Since it would be funny for you to try to fight him.

446
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,430
His attacks are mostly blockable.

447
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,970
When an officer's entire body glows red, it's an unblockable.

448
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,730
Together with Lord Wang Yun.

449
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,050
Thank you for the super chat.

450
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,210
Yeah, I saw that.

451
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,610
But then there was like, two unblockable attacks.

452
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,610
Like, he did two unblockable attacks on me.

453
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,730
And then I was like, yeah, nevermind.

454
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,750
And then I have no more buttons after that.

455
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,710
I don't know.

456
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,870
Be careful.

457
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,230
How is he already here?

458
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,210
I'm still trying to fight this one guy.

459
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:40,850
Oh no.

460
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,810
Oh no.

461
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,710
Oh no.

462
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,430
Are you okay?

463
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,870
He pursued you?

464
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,590
Let us cooperate.

465
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,910
If I can be of help, then I would be happy to.

466
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,710
I didn't expect to be able to pay you back so soon.

467
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,250
Oh no.

468
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,790
Oh my god, I see him in my rearview mirror right now.

469
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,910
Oh my god, Cao Cao.

470
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,190
Cao Cao, please.

471
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,650
Stop fighting Cao Cao.

472
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,890
Get over here.

473
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,330
Oh my god, he's glowing.

474
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,670
Oh my god, there's a red aura.

475
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,170
He's in my rearview mirror, Cao Cao.

476
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,570
Oh my god.

477
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,470
He's coming over.

478
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,150
Cao Cao.

479
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:39,750
Oh god, he's right there.

480
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,290
Bro, who's walking next to me?

481
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,610
Oh god, I don't think I can kill him.

482
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,030
I don't think I can kill him, guys.

483
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,670
I am very scared.

484
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,270
Oh no.

485
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,710
Oh my god.

486
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,470
Oh wait, it's a Zhang Liao!

487
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:11,870
Okay, not gonna lie, as a little bird, I had a crush on Zhang Liao.

488
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,630
Oh shit!

489
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,570
Wait, he's gonna fucking kill me.

490
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,790
I'm not even gonna die to Lu Bu, I'm gonna die to his other general.

491
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:30,130
Okay, but like, as a little bird, I won't lie, I had a crush on Zhang Liao.

492
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,930
This guy.

493
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,190
I thought he was so cool.

494
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,130
What the fuck, how did I get on a horse?

495
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,550
Oh shit!

496
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:45,890
Oh shit!

497
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,270
Oh my god, my heart rate is... it's not good.

498
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:56,310
My heart rate is going up, and not because I still have a crush on Zhang Liao, but like, I'm actually gonna die.

499
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,710
Oh my god.

500
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,150
Fuck.

501
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,130
Okay.

502
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,210
Why do I accidentally kill my horse?

503
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,930
I'm like panicking, so I'm actually...

504
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,390
Oh!

505
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,670
No!

506
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:08,450
Oh!

507
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,490
Okay.

508
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:15,810
Oh my god.

509
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,090
I'm literally like 1 HP right now.

510
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,610
Okay.

511
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
Okay, there's a bun.

512
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:23,810
There's a bun.

513
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:26,770
Oh!

514
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,430
That was so scary.

515
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,710
That was so scary.

516
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,150
I'm...

517
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,510
I...

518
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,030
Oh my god, thank god.

519
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,990
I don't know, he was just so cool.

520
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,790
I just thought he was so fucking cool.

521
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,190
Him and Zhuge Liang were like my crushes in Dynasty Warriors.

522
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,890
Okay, open the door.

523
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,310
No, that's okay.

524
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,350
That's okay.

525
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,790
Everything is okay.

526
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,110
I...

527
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,870
I might be like really fucked up right now.

528
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,790
Because like, you know...

529
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,250
I don't have any HP, but that's okay.

530
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,790
That's alright.

531
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,090
I don't need HP.

532
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,970
As long as Lu Bu is not on me, that's fine.

533
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,390
Wait, I think I went the wrong way.

534
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,290
Where am I supposed to go, guys?

535
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,290
I don't know, what am I...

536
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,170
Wait, am I supposed to be here?

537
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,470
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

538
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,710
Am I supposed to... wait.

539
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,250
Where am I...

540
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,330
Wait, is this the right way?

541
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,090
Oh, he's right there.

542
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,010
Wait, he's right there.

543
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,630
Oh, see the yellow flag.

544
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,310
Okay.

545
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,130
Okay, I'm a little worried right now though.

546
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,310
About like, my team.

547
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,470
Because Lu Bu is nearly right there.

548
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,550
And I'm a little worried.

549
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,470
Pursue him?!

550
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,010
I have no buttons!

551
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,470
What do you mean pursue him?!

552
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,810
Like, I'm actually... I might die.

553
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,130
I might die.

554
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,510
I have no buttons at all.

555
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,890
Oh my god!

556
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,390
I might die to a regular man!

557
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,650
Wait, he's...

558
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,050
Oh no, he's fighting downtown!

559
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,870
Oh shit!

560
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,150
Oh no!

561
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,970
Guys, it's over.

562
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,810
Guys, it's over.

563
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,230
Wait, this is...

564
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,410
Oh my god!

565
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,470
Oh my god!

566
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,050
Please!

567
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,130
No!

568
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,430
Oh my god!

569
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,930
He's so strong!

570
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,190
What the fuck?

571
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,270
Okay, you know what?

572
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,350
Let's fight Lu Bu.

573
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,830
You know... Oh my god, I'm so close.

574
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:02,710
Okay, guys.

575
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,630
We're going all the way from the beginning.

576
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,090
I'm gonna fight Lu Bu.

577
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,610
I'm gonna do it.

578
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,910
I can...

579
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,330
Oh shit.

580
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,610
What the fuck?!

581
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,750
What the fuck?!

582
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,770
I'm gonna do it!

583
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:30,830
Oh god.

584
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,270
I'm gonna do it.

585
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,330
I almost died, but...

586
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,690
Oh my god.

587
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,670
What is wrong with you?

588
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,950
I'm gonna do it.

589
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,110
Oh my god, perfect parry!

590
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,650
What?

591
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,490
What?

592
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,690
I can do it.

593
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,470
I can do it.

594
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,290
I'm dead.

595
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,970
I'm dead.

596
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,570
Okay.

597
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,370
I can do it.

598
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,750
No, no, no.

599
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,810
I can do it.

600
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,490
I can do it.

601
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,970
Look at that.

602
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,790
Look at me go!

603
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,310
Look at me go!

604
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:11,830
Whoa!

605
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,210
I lasted...

606
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,410
Guys, I lasted 47 seconds.

607
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,930
I think that was pretty good.

608
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,030
Guys, I...

609
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,890
I...

610
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,050
I lasted 47 seconds, guys.

611
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,110
I think that's...

612
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,890
I think...

613
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,150
I think that was a pretty good record.

614
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,890
It's okay, I can do this.

615
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,690
I...

616
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,990
Okay.

617
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,630
Oh my god!

618
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,390
Did I not die?

619
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,470
Holy shit!

620
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,410
This is it, this is it.

621
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,030
I can do this.

622
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,050
Oh, shit.

623
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,630
Oh, the jump.

624
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,870
Okay, this is it.

625
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,530
Oh my god!

626
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,630
Jesus Christ!

627
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,150
My last bun!

628
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,570
I don't have any more buns!

629
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,630
Guys, look at that!

630
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,090
Look at the amount of damage I do!

631
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,870
He has a bow?!

632
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,290
Guys.

633
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,290
How come he has a bow?

634
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,150
Yep.

635
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,170
Why the fuck...

636
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,350
Okay, okay.

637
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,330
I can do this.

638
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,830
It's like he brought a fucking gun!

639
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,550
Who's looking at a...

640
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,170
Oh, fuck.

641
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,710
I...

642
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,370
I can't dodge this.

643
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,690
Oh my god!

644
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,570
Holy shit!

645
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,450
That's not fair!

646
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,250
He, like, brought a fucking bow!

647
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,090
Okay.

648
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:53,470
Okay.

649
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,070
Like, how do I parry it?!

650
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,090
How the fuck do I parry that?!

651
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,090
Okay.

652
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,030
Okay, there we go.

653
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,910
Nice!

654
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,690
Another parry!

655
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,710
I just need one more parry.

656
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,190
Nice!

657
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,850
Oh my god!

658
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,590
I have one bun left!

659
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:15,930
This is it.

660
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,750
Jesus Christ!

661
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,400
Bye.

662
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,420
What?!

663
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,190
What the fuck?!

664
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,530
Okay.

665
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,330
Guys.

666
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,290
Guys, I don't think I can pursue Lu Bu, guys.

667
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,070
I...

668
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,340
Guys.

669
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,430
Guys.

670
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,010
Sometimes retreat is the answer, guys.

671
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,390
Sometimes...

672
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,470
Sometimes it's okay to run away, guys.

673
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,470
Sometimes it's just...

674
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,050
Yeah, you know what?

675
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,830
I'll take...

676
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,310
I'll take 53 seconds.

677
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,230
Guys, I'll...

678
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,370
I mean...

679
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:04,550
Guys.

680
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,470
All I'm saying is that...

681
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,710
I don't think any of you guys can last more than 53 seconds against Lu Bu.

682
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,170
Come on!

683
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,970
Don't lie to me!

684
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,270
You really think you can last longer against the Lu Bu?

685
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,210
Oh my god, he's coming.

686
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,770
Oh my god.

687
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,570
Holy shit.

688
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,990
This is tactical, okay?

689
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,170
I...

690
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,670
We tried.

691
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:30,950
We tried.

692
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,830
Our record was 57 seconds.

693
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,790
I beat him there?

694
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,670
Oh, I didn't know we were lying today.

695
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,030
I didn't know today we were gonna fucking lie.

696
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,090
Can Chow Chow die so I fail?

697
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,030
Equivalent exchange.

698
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,410
You know what?

699
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,070
That's fine.

700
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,610
Okay.

701
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,270
Let's just get him out of here.

702
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,950
Okay.

703
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,970
Come on, he's so close.

704
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,070
Oh my god, he's coming.

705
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,530
I see him in my rearview mirror, guys.

706
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,010
We gotta leave.

707
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,270
We gotta fucking leave.

708
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,990
I see him on my rearview mirror.

709
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,770
Goodbye!

710
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,410
Please!

711
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,950
Oh shit.

712
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,810
Please, let me through!

713
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,230
Please!

714
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,630
I don't wanna deal with him!

715
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,110
Okay.

716
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,610
Oh my god.

717
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:39,950
Oh, get out of here.

718
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,090
Okay, that's cheating, man.

719
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,390
You have, like, shields.

720
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,610
Like, I have Lu Bu on my fucking tail right now.

721
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,850
Guys, what is the button to call my horse?

722
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,470
Can I keep accidentally pressing it?

723
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,010
Is it this one?

724
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,190
Oh, okay, it has to be this one.

725
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,210
Nevermind, I figured it out.

726
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,190
Okay.

727
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,830
Let me make sure we kill him.

728
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:04,870
Nice.

729
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,190
Okay, Chow Chow, I guess you'll just watch.

730
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:08,930
Like, always.

731
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,430
I keep accidentally pressing my horse button for some fucking reason.

732
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,490
Alright, let's go.

733
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,930
We gotta kill Dong Min.

734
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:23,650
Man.

735
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,050
Don't worry.

736
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,470
Oh my god.

737
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,470
Look, we're not thieves here.

738
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,070
We just wanna make sure we don't die to Lu Bu.

739
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,450
Thank god the red hair is not here yet.

740
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,170
Thank fucking god.

741
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,050
Oh my god, I'm just lucky the red hair isn't chasing us.

742
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,210
We would have already been dead.

743
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,130
Oh, come on.

744
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,390
I know about the staff.

745
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,670
I know about the staff.

746
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:57,950
Please.

747
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,750
Please.

748
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,650
He's in my rear view mirror.

749
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,790
It's like Jurassic Park all over again.

750
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,430
Let's go.

751
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,490
We gotta go.

752
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,950
What is the strongest weapon anyway in Dynasty Warriors, guys?

753
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,010
Oh, I fucking know.

754
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,950
I'm fucking scared.

755
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,950
I can only last 57 seconds against that man.

756
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,150
I don't think I wanna fight him.

757
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:36,210
Okay, nice.

758
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,110
Locked.

759
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,530
The spear?

760
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,150
Wait, is the spear actually the strongest?

761
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,490
Oh shit.

762
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,610
I know Lu Bu's approaching.

763
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,230
I know he's coming.

764
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,210
Nice.

765
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,170
The AK-47.

766
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,550
Next boss.

767
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,330
Oh, the Shu Yong.

768
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,430
It's not about how strong it is.

769
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,270
It's absolutely about how strong it is.

770
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,970
You think Lu Bu's weapon...

771
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,370
He chose that weapon because of how cool...

772
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,490
I mean, it does look pretty cool.

773
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,070
But it's also one of his strongest weapons in ancient China.

774
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,170
I mean, he's lucky.

775
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,670
He has the bonus of it looking very fucking cool.

776
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,370
Toki, what you gonna do?

777
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,890
What you gonna do when Lu Bu comes for you?

778
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,450
I don't know, die?

779
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,390
I'm thinking of the super chat.

780
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,850
Simple thing to think, yeah.

781
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,290
Like, what else can I do?

782
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,350
All I can do is fucking die.

783
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,490
Okay.

784
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,650
Oh my god!

785
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,270
Wait, how is he already here?

786
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,490
Cao Cao, no!

787
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,730
Cao Cao!

788
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:17,970
Run!

789
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,410
Oh no!

790
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,470
Oh my god!

791
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,590
Get out of here!

792
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,330
What are you doing?

793
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,910
Fucking, we gotta go!

794
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,430
Cao Cao, we gotta go!

795
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:33,930
Cao Cao, no!

796
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,550
What are you?

797
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,050
I was here!

798
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,550
Oh my god.

799
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,350
That was fucking scary.

800
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,930
Like, what is he doing here?

801
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,610
Nice.

802
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,130
I wish Jenny was here.

803
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,510
Where the fuck is Jing now?

804
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:12,850
Wait, where did he go?

805
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,230
Oh, he's over there.

806
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,830
Guys, I do not think I can fight him.

807
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,630
Jesus Christ.

808
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,710
Guys, I would love to fight him.

809
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,990
Guys, we have tried.

810
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:38,210
I don't even think he knew I existed in that one fight.

811
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,530
I think that was the worst part.

812
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,850
Like, I barely existed for that man.

813
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,870
Okay, I didn't...

814
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,750
Guys, it wasn't even two times.

815
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,930
It was actually three times.

816
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,970
Like, I think it was four times.

817
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,750
It happened so fast that you guys think I...

818
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,210
You guys forgot I did it four times.

819
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:09,430
Oh my god.

820
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:22,290
Oh my god, Chao Chao, please.

821
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,950
I'm trying to kill him.

822
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,930
Oh god, thank god Chao Chao fucking ate a bread.

823
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,090
Oh no.

824
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:37,750
Oh no.

825
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,590
I'm trying my best.

826
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:46,690
Oh god, Lupo's killing all of them.

827
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,530
Okay, nice.

828
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,210
Nice, Chao Chao.

829
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,370
We're almost there.

830
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:58,650
Okay.

831
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,530
God, fucking nerds.

832
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,210
Please.

833
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,810
Wait, wait, is he behind me?

834
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,030
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

835
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,690
Chao Chao, Chao Chao, Chao Chao, please.

836
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,730
Chao Chao, please.

837
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,750
Oh shit.

838
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,370
Oh shit, I'm gonna use this.

839
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,190
Chao Chao.

840
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,550
Chao Chao.

841
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,690
He's right behind us.

842
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,590
He's right behind us.

843
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,890
I'm trying my best.

844
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,850
There's so many shields!

845
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,870
Oh my god, how many fucking shields are there?

846
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,390
He's literally right behind us.

847
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,130
He's right behind me, isn't he?

848
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,870
Oh my god.

849
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,570
Jesus Christ, this is so obnoxious.

850
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,090
Oh my god, Chao Chao, yes!

851
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:09,870
Thank god!

852
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,510
Oh, thank god.

853
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,050
Thank god!

854
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,630
Thank fucking god, get over here!

855
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,410
Oh my god, he's right there!

856
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,030
Oh my god, he's right there!

857
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,950
Oh my god, thank god.

858
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,070
Oh my god, he was right there.

859
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,570
He was right there.

860
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,150
Oh my god, he was right there.

861
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,590
He almost got me.

862
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,570
Oh my god, he almost fucking...

863
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,210
He almost got me.

864
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,370
If he, like, poked me once, I'd be gone.

865
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,210
I'm so god.

866
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,730
Oh, save.

867
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,770
The Xiaohun family saved me.

868
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,190
God, it felt like I was in Jurassic Park.

869
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,310
I was driving the jeep and I see Lu Bu in the rear view mirror.

870
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,030
I...

871
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:08,290
I swear to god, it felt like I was in that car.

872
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,460
He just wore it in a nipple.

873
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,900
Holy fuck, that was scary.

874
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,160
That is actually so scary.

875
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,300
I thought, like...

876
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,500
They always say do not pursue Lu Bu.

877
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,340
But what do I do when he pursues me?

878
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,740
Like, what do I do?

879
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,500
Usually, it's the other way around.

880
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,900
They never warn you of what you do when he starts chasing you.

881
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:12,110
Uh...

882
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,030
I think I see a way to follow me.

883
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,570
I will make it mysterious.

884
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:16,830
Follow me.

885
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,850
That night.

886
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,110
Oh, he trusts me.

887
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,690
It's okay, I can get it later.

888
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:40,950
Yeah,

889
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,640
why are you here?

890
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,040
Where were you when Lu Bu was chasing me?

891
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,020
What do you mean you were gonna be here when I needed you?

892
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,620
I was screaming my fucking lungs out.

893
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,880
Where were you?

894
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,420
And Lu Bu doesn't?

895
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,360
Bro, that guy brought a fucking gun to a fight.

896
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,410
I'm finally pursuing the hero.

897
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,230
Thank you so much, chat.

898
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,090
Tao Tao the hero?

899
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:45,990
Damn.

900
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,810
I mean, he did win in the end.

901
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,710
Yeah, let's trust Tao.

902
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,650
Yeah, guys.

903
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:57,510
We all know Tao Tao is the most trustworthy guy out there.

904
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,530
I trust him.

905
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,110
The winners are heroes.

906
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,050
Yeah, guys.

907
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,590
We all know Tao Tao's history has been marked with honesty and trust.

908
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,710
Just like how Guan Yu really trusted Tao Tao.

909
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,470
And lived to old age.

910
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:42,390
Right, guys?

911
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,430
It was nothing really.

912
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,770
I don't want to tell people I had help.

913
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,230
All of them think I'm awesome.

914
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:58,590
Yeah!

915
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:19,990
Yeah.

916
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,930
Of course not.

917
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:32,710
I don't know.

918
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,110
No, fuck Yao Chen.

919
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,090
Don't be a fucking simp, Tao Tao.

920
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,850
She's gonna get married like three to four different times.

921
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,770
She's gonna fuck Liu Bu.

922
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,630
I sleep now.

923
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,770
Oh my god, why am I dreaming about her?

924
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,330
I don't want to pursue her!

925
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,990
Stop!

926
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,510
She's not the only woman in this game!

927
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,630
There's other women in Dynasty Warriors!

928
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,290
I should have choices!

929
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,900
Name them.

930
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:57,020
You know, the other women that's gonna show up later in the game.

931
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,600
Name one other woman in Dynasty Warriors.

932
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,440
You know, the child.

933
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,120
But obviously not her.

934
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,480
I'm not gonna name her, guys.

935
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,560
But there's other mature women later on in the game, guys.

936
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,320
I swear to god!

937
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,940
Kills without companion wrecks havoc across the land.

938
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,720
His countless sins have proved enough of his unjust, bestial nature.

939
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:36,380
It's time we act, answer the Emperor's call, gather our troops, and put an end to this evil.

940
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,980
The veracity of this edict matters little to the Lords awaiting this moment.

941
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,780
We excuse to unite their forces to begin their march to Luoyang.

942
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,760
Like, you know...

943
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,300
Oh my god, they're all kids, too.

944
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,740
They're all children or wives of the other generals.

945
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,900
So, like... Guys, I swear to... Oh my god.

946
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,180
Okay, so there's Zhuge Liang's wife.

947
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,440
There's Cao Pi's wife.

948
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,420
There's...

949
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,200
There's Zhang Fei's wife and daughter.

950
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,480
There's Guan Yu's daughter.

951
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,380
There's...

952
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,480
I'm trying to think of one that's single!

953
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,440
I'm trying to think of the single ones!

954
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,680
Okay, why all the wives?

955
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,200
Those aren't names.

956
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,450
Diao Chan is technically a wife, too!

957
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:45,830
She's the wife of Dong Zhuo, Lu Bu, and one other guy.

958
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:59,410
If Yuan Shao can make up for that by leading the coalition, it's a small price.

959
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,230
Just one name, Doki!

960
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:03,890
Name one woman!

961
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,770
What am I?

962
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,010
What are you trying to do?

963
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:09,930
This isn't Fortnite!

964
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,130
This isn't Fortnite!

965
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,150
Why are you trying to set up a trap for me?

966
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:19,770
Right!

967
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,750
We'll strike them down together!

968
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,670
The die has been cast.

969
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,110
All that remains...

970
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,610
Just give us one name!

971
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,630
Just name a woman!

972
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,200
Guys!

973
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,280
Come on!

974
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,740
Come on, guys!

975
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,980
What are you trying to say?

976
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,720
Chen... Wait, what's... Oh my god, what's the flute lady?

977
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,780
What's Cao Pi's fucking... What's Cao Cao's son's wife's called?

978
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,940
Chen Ji?

979
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh, you love women?

980
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,200
Name one.

981
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,880
Come on, thank you for the super chat.

982
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,000
Thank you, thank you.

983
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,040
Yeah, see?

984
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,140
Chen Ji!

985
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,880
I remember her!

986
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,080
Because she used a flute to whack people.

987
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:18,980
Look at that!

988
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,180
Our name!

989
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,060
Chen Ji was pretty hot, too.

990
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,160
She was.

991
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,880
But she's also taken.

992
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,260
And also, like, much younger.

993
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,740
Because she's literally Cao Cao's son's wife.

994
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,760
So, like, she's basically Sun Shan Xian.

995
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,640
So, like, that's, like, sort of, like, that's iffy, guys.

996
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,480
That's iffy.

997
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,400
I'm trying to find women that are not children!

998
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,260
Guys!

999
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,320
Alright, let's see.

1000
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,100
Ready to go out.

1001
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,830
Oh, she was 20?

1002
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,750
Oh, it's, um...

1003
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,690
It's the axe guy.

1004
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,810
Oh my gosh, she's 20?!

1005
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,890
Guys, we have a chance.

1006
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,870
We have a chance, guys.

1007
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,370
Yes, Yan Wei!

1008
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:19,670
Guys, we're safe.

1009
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,190
She's 20.

1010
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,590
Oh, she's 10 right now.

1011
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,170
Oh, guys, I was joking.

1012
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,650
I was testing you guys.

1013
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,470
Oh, wait, that's bad.

1014
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:40,370
But she's only 20 later.

1015
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,630
Guys, I am not waiting!

1016
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,530
That is so...

1017
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,230
Guys, what the fuck is...

1018
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,750
Guys!

1019
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,770
You can't just beat DL Chan!

1020
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,850
Yikes, thank you for the super chat.

1021
01:00:59,110 --> 01:00:59,350
Thank you.

1022
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,650
Oh my god.

1023
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,830
There has to be other women!

1024
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1025
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,870
Thank you, thank you.

1026
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,270
Guys, I'm gonna...

1027
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,310
Guys, I'm gonna make some tea, guys.

1028
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,270
Guys, I'm gonna make some tea.

1029
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,250
I'll be right back.

1030
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:04,450
It's also not my fault, okay?

1031
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,730
The early...

1032
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:09,790
The early Dynasty Warrior games...

1033
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:13,870
They had, like, four women characters you can play, okay?

1034
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:21,030
And it was Chen Ji, Sun Shen Qian, Yao Chen, and then the wild one.

1035
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,330
You know, the one in the jungle?

1036
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:23,690
That girl.

1037
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,150
I don't remember her name.

1038
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,330
But there was, like, actually...

1039
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,810
And then they added more, but I already forgot their...

1040
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,630
And then, oh yeah, the Qiao sisters too.

1041
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,890
Okay, the Qiao sisters were cute.

1042
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,110
I love them.

1043
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,350
I love their, like, fans as weapons, guys.

1044
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,330
And then I forgot all the other ones.

1045
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,770
Yeah, the Zhudong girl.

1046
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,920
Hello, guys.

1047
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:58,560
Yu Ying?

1048
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,400
Isn't Yu Ying Zhuge Liang's wife?

1049
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,540
Yeah, but she was, like...

1050
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:02,720
Okay.

1051
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,120
Okay, I'll talk about her.

1052
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:05,800
Okay.

1053
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:11,120
But, like, her literal character description is that she was so fucking plain.

1054
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:15,120
And people couldn't believe Zhuge Liang married her.

1055
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,740
Because she was, like, technically ugly.

1056
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,740
And then, so, like, they made her design so fucking average.

1057
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,260
Because they're trying to be like, yeah, she's ugly.

1058
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,840
Look at how boring her design is.

1059
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,020
And that's why I could never remember her.

1060
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,700
Because, like, but she wasn't ugly.

1061
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,620
Like, she wasn't ugly in the game.

1062
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,820
It's just that they made her design so fucking average.

1063
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,560
That she wasn't memorable.

1064
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,700
Because in the story, she's supposed to be really ugly.

1065
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,420
But really, really smart.

1066
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,180
And then people were like, why did you marry her?

1067
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,040
She's so ugly.

1068
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,720
But then he's like, I don't care about how she looks.

1069
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,540
It's all about her mind.

1070
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,180
That's literally, like, that's literally her story.

1071
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,260
Chang Kong is here.

1072
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,880
Who the fuck cares about Chang Kong?

1073
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,000
Like, they added him later in the game.

1074
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,900
So I could never, like, I never, like, saw her as memorable.

1075
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,880
Because her design was just so average.

1076
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,420
They made her so hot, though.

1077
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,100
To be fair, everybody.

1078
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,780
Pang Tong was supposed to be, like, super fucking ugly, too.

1079
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,840
But then they, like, they're just like, okay, instead of making him ugly, let's just cover him in clothes.

1080
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:32,200
Because they don't know how to make ugly characters except for Dong Zhuo.

1081
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,100
Except for, like, Dong Zhuo.

1082
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,520
That's, like, the only guy they made ugly.

1083
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:39,840
Until now.

1084
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,080
Okay.

1085
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,920
I am not sure.

1086
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,920
Then you have my grat...

1087
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,100
Then you have my gratitude.

1088
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,840
Gratitude.

1089
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,060
He's, like, a fucking traitor.

1090
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,260
Yeah, he's a fucking snake.

1091
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:20,880
Okay.

1092
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:22,600
Next scene.

1093
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,540
Thank you for the super chat.

1094
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:23,760
Thank you.

1095
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,340
Thank you.

1096
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,780
Using fans as weapons.

1097
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,140
I guess a Chong Kun could make a good cannibal.

1098
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,180
100%.

1099
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,520
That's why they're so chonky.

1100
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,640
They're, like, that...

1101
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,460
No, they're, like, the...

1102
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,220
In Lord of the Rings, you know, the giant...

1103
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:35,580
The...

1104
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,360
The giants they use.

1105
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,000
Okay.

1106
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,280
You guys can't deny it, but we're 100% the fucking villains in Lord of the Rings.

1107
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,880
Like, if we were, like...

1108
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,920
Like, a faction, we would be the...

1109
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,080
You know, we would be, like, the swordsmen.

1110
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,880
The Sauron faction with the giant fucking trolls that walk around.

1111
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,820
So, like, the Chong Kuns would be that.

1112
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,760
Like, the giant trolls just walking around.

1113
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,560
And then, like...

1114
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,120
Oh, 100...

1115
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,300
Yeah.

1116
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,020
You know, like the...

1117
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,420
You know the Lord of the Rings RTS?

1118
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,840
I love the RTS game of the Lord of the Rings RTS.

1119
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,680
I wish they did a remaster of that game.

1120
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,020
I would, like...

1121
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,240
I played that game so much when I was growing up.

1122
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,000
The...

1123
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,240
The Lord of the Rings RTS game.

1124
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,080
We would definitely be the Sauron...

1125
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:16,540
The Sauron...

1126
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,000
The Sauron faction.

1127
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,200
The battle for Middle-Earth.

1128
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:20,540
Yeah.

1129
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,740
The battle for Middle-Earth.

1130
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,140
Yeah, there is!

1131
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,920
It was one of my favorite RTS games.

1132
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:30,860
That and Starcraft.

1133
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,280
It was so fun.

1134
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,180
I always played the Sauron faction.

1135
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,300
And the...

1136
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:37,960
The evil ones.

1137
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,440
Because the evil ones have the cool...

1138
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,660
Have the cool minions.

1139
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,300
Have the coolest units.

1140
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,440
I don't think they have, like, a remastered version of it, though.

1141
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,480
If they did, I would play it.

1142
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,060
Because I love that game.

1143
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,470
Are you sure we'll be able to?

1144
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:22,610
Because the bad guys always have the coolest designs.

1145
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,510
Who the fuck would want to play as humans in Lord of the Rings?

1146
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,690
Why the fuck would I want to be a man?

1147
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,010
With a bow?

1148
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:32,610
When I can be a goblin with a bow.

1149
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,850
Riding a fucking dog.

1150
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:40,790
Okay.

1151
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:41,830
Alright, Hongi.

1152
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:48,960
But Erigando!

1153
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:49,880
Yeah!

1154
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,620
But I could be a Nazgul!

1155
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,440
On a dragon!

1156
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,040
Erigan walks on his feet!

1157
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,720
Yes, I'll walk!

1158
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,160
The Nazgul rides a fucking dragon!

1159
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,320
Okay, I'm not going to ask about the child.

1160
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:04,900
Where's Sun Jian?

1161
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,500
Oh, they're like introducing each faction to me now.

1162
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,920
Well, I obviously don't care about the red faction.

1163
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,860
And there's Cao Cao's faction.

1164
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,080
I'm going to join Liu Bei's just for Zhuge Liang.

1165
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,080
Just because he's hot.

1166
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,380
I'm only doing it for him.

1167
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:54,000
He is my Three Kingdoms Oshi.

1168
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,460
And I want to see Pantong die for the 10th time.

1169
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:21,520
He doesn't join until the end?

1170
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,600
That's why I'm playing the long game.

1171
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,220
Doki, why?

1172
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,220
After everything we went through...

1173
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:34,920
He's hot.

1174
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,720
I don't think I can.

1175
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,260
I'm sorry, my heart is already taken by Zhuge Liang.

1176
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,880
I'm sorry, Cao Cao.

1177
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,080
He is my only Oshi in this game.

1178
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,260
He has been my Oshi.

1179
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,600
He has been my Oshi since Dynasty Warriors 2.

1180
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,240
I have spoken.

1181
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,800
If you say so.

1182
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,840
Alright, I'll do what I can.

1183
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,500
Look, there's only one of me and so many of you, guys.

1184
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,080
Calm down.

1185
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,400
Calm down, everybody.

1186
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,900
Why am I walking with him?

1187
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,900
Fade to black.

1188
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,170
You must be our commander.

1189
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,990
I'm proud to be serving you.

1190
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:35,830
We're a varied bunch.

1191
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:40,650
Some of us are well-versed in the martial arts, while others just came from sowing the fields.

1192
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:44,630
But we're all the same in wanting to make the world a better place.

1193
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,010
Just the two of us.

1194
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,150
We look forward to your command, sir.

1195
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:54,260
Okay.

1196
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,640
Oh my god, is this it?

1197
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,620
Is this Hulo Gate?

1198
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,400
Oh, I have a squad!

1199
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:02,820
Squad!

1200
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,620
We have a squad now!

1201
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,060
So do I- Wait, do I have better weapons?

1202
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,960
Level 80.

1203
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,480
Oh, I have a level 80 sword now.

1204
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:12,920
Nice.

1205
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,400
Level 80 sphere.

1206
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,760
Oh, wait.

1207
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,040
Level 91.

1208
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,740
Oh, the red rush staff.

1209
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,960
Okay, we're still gonna get the- Apparently, the Crimson Orchard is still the best one.

1210
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,340
Wait, do I have a stronger attack?

1211
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,460
No, they're all the same.

1212
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,660
Yeah, okay.

1213
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,420
We don't care about the other horses.

1214
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,800
Also, we don't care about these.

1215
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,160
Oh, where's my squad?

1216
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,000
How do I- How do I use my guards?

1217
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,900
Unleash a vol- How do I use them?

1218
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,180
How do I use my fucking team?

1219
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,800
Okay, I don't even know how to use my fucking team.

1220
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:09,600
Oh, wait.

1221
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,320
I have offerings.

1222
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,280
Wait, what?

1223
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,640
Oh, I don't.

1224
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,860
I thought that was my offering.

1225
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,460
Okay, wait.

1226
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,760
I wanna see if I have any romance options yet.

1227
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:26,630
Alright.

1228
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:30,970
Alright, what are my- Do I have anybody that wants to talk to me?

1229
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,310
Let's see what your reputation is like these days.

1230
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,650
Oh, Xiaodun?

1231
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,430
Okay, Hanover.

1232
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,190
Wait, what?

1233
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,550
Mediation possible?

1234
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,400
Oh, I can- I can improve my bond?

1235
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:55,050
I have to fucking pay- I have to give him money?

1236
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:01,230
Oh, skip my training.

1237
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,650
Okay, where's my training with him?

1238
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,330
Bro, what the fuck?

1239
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:08,950
Is he gonna be my escort?

1240
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,030
Like, what?

1241
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,690
I was like, what?

1242
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:12,830
Why do I have to pay him?

1243
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:16,130
Okay, while in rage form, what do I need?

1244
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,910
Using a po'dowl.

1245
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,190
Okay, I can use a po'dowl.

1246
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,650
Okay, let's see.

1247
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,110
What- Where is the- Okay, 89.

1248
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:29,810
That's fine.

1249
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:33,670
I just need to use rage and charge.

1250
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:37,030
I need you to touch this with Lu Bu.

1251
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,750
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1252
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:40,930
Thank you, thank you.

1253
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,830
Okay, in rage, charge attack.

1254
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,170
I don't use a charge attack.

1255
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:48,170
I don't remember how to use a charge- I'll figure this out.

1256
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,290
I'll figure this out.

1257
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:52,990
I can do it.

1258
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:56,990
Alright, Dong Zhuo.

1259
01:13:59,090 --> 01:13:59,710
Is this a gate?

1260
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:00,730
Is this Huluo Gate?

1261
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:01,710
Oh wait, no, it's not.

1262
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:05,190
This is not Huluo Gate.

1263
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:09,490
Oh, hold it down.

1264
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,790
Okay.

1265
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,180
Okay.

1266
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,570
We're located just outside of Luoyang, where Dong Zhuo resides.

1267
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,430
Zishui Gate is one of the barriers protecting the city.

1268
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:35,450
Two enemy officers guard the gate, Li Ju under the command of Dong Zhuo and Huluo Xiang, a warrior widely renowned for his sheer might.

1269
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,690
The only way is through them.

1270
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:42,230
I want all of your forces working together to achieve this goal.

1271
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,430
Guys, do I fight Lu Bu here?

1272
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,770
Please don't tell me I fight Lu Bu here.

1273
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:51,490
Please, guys, I don't think- Guys, please, I'm not ready, guys.

1274
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:54,610
Please.

1275
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:00,710
Guys, guys, I don't- Oh, thank god.

1276
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,970
We are in the superior of the enemy- Oh, thank god.

1277
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,550
Thank fucking god.

1278
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:09,130
I don't think I can- I don't think I can do it.

1279
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,430
Guys, I'm not ready.

1280
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:14,870
Guys- You mean to place me in the rear guard?

1281
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:15,850
I mean, you ain't shit.

1282
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:17,770
Glory is my right birthright.

1283
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:20,450
Yeah, I was gonna be like, this isn't Hulao Gate.

1284
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,710
This- This isn't Hulao Gate.

1285
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:23,550
I'm not ready.

1286
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:29,650
Your pedigree is completely useless on the field of battle, in this petty officer- official's opinion.

1287
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,810
You impotent!

1288
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:33,950
That's enough, you two.

1289
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:35,490
I'm not ready, guys.

1290
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,510
I'm not- Well, I'm not trained.

1291
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:39,170
I'm not trained enough.

1292
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,850
Everyone will have a chance to prove their valour in the battle to come.

1293
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:44,830
You have all been notified of your positions.

1294
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,970
It will be up to each of you to read the battlefield and decide the best course of action here.

1295
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:51,710
Then, our choices will make all the difference.

1296
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:55,990
Oh no, I'm gonna get Shahoodun as my companion.

1297
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:56,550
What the fuck?

1298
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,190
Oh wait, I can have Guan Yun?

1299
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:01,250
Okay, but Shahoodun is cooler, guys.

1300
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:01,850
He's cooler.

1301
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,130
He still has two eyes.

1302
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:07,230
Okay, and he'll be even cooler when he has one eye.

1303
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:13,470
He is already cool with two eyes, but imagine how cool he will be with one.

1304
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:20,150
Guys,

1305
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,950
I'm trying to remember how to do charge attack.

1306
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,590
Guys, it's not working.

1307
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:35,250
Guys, the charge attack isn't working, guys.

1308
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:41,270
I don't remember how to do charge attack, guys.

1309
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,710
How do I charge it?

1310
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,570
I'm coming for that big charge.

1311
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:55,990
Oh, hold Y.

1312
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,150
Oh, I was holding... Okay.

1313
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,030
I was not holding Y, guys.

1314
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,410
I was holding... I was holding everything.

1315
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:06,590
I was holding X.

1316
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:07,930
Was that noticeable?

1317
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,670
Was it noticeable that I wasn't holding Y?

1318
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:15,930
Jesus Christ.

1319
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:20,570
This guy is so strong for a fucking petty officer.

1320
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:28,050
Jesus, why is he so strong?

1321
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:28,330
Why?

1322
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:37,550
Oh my god, I used like all my bread.

1323
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,470
Oh, wait, what?

1324
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:50,230
Where is he?

1325
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,370
Oh, shit.

1326
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,450
Oh, shit.

1327
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:57,810
Oh, shit.

1328
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:58,530
Oh, guys, I'm stuck on the tree.

1329
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:03,170
Don't worry, I'll save you.

1330
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:08,190
Okay, but first I gotta kill this guy first.

1331
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:16,870
Oh my god, bro, you're fucking... I'm gonna... I can't.

1332
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,950
Guys, I'm gonna pay him $4,000.

1333
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:28,290
I'm gonna pay the relationship therapist.

1334
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,290
Guys, I'm sorry.

1335
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:37,330
I'm gonna pay the relationship therapist $4,000.

1336
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,510
I don't think I can do it.

1337
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:43,290
He gets my 4k.

1338
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,150
He'll fix my... He'll fix our relationship.

1339
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,050
I believe in him.

1340
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:52,830
I just don't understand.

1341
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,630
Don't worry.

1342
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,970
He'll fix our relationship.

1343
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,410
I believe in him to fix my relationship.

1344
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,690
There we go.

1345
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,150
Don't worry, Sujin.

1346
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,570
Eat your bread.

1347
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,790
Okay.

1348
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,590
I got you.

1349
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:31,650
Wait, Pan Fen and Yun Fu has been... Bro, I can't fucking... There's so many people.

1350
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:37,550
Oh, no.

1351
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,670
Not the morals.

1352
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,170
I don't know why I used the arrow.

1353
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:52,030
I'm trying to... Oh, I don't have enough allies.

1354
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:52,450
Okay.

1355
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:55,310
I'm so confused.

1356
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:57,230
I was like, what do you mean?

1357
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:04,410
Okay, my coalition fucking sucks.

1358
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:05,630
Not gonna lie.

1359
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,630
Use the order... That's what I was trying to do!

1360
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,790
Oh, Hanzo, please.

1361
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:22,230
I'm trying my best to save every... I'm one man!

1362
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,610
Okay.

1363
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,610
Bro, I just killed seven officers.

1364
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:35,870
What do you mean number alone is not enough?

1365
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,790
Oh, my god.

1366
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,310
Oh, shit.

1367
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:49,830
Okay.

1368
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,090
Who needs help?

1369
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,290
Okay, we need help.

1370
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,930
Oh, please.

1371
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,470
I am getting there as a... Please, old man!

1372
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:07,870
I'm getting over there!

1373
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:12,010
I killed so many people!

1374
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:12,390
Please!

1375
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,090
Eat your buns!

1376
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,370
Eat your buns, everybody!

1377
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:19,890
Eat your buns!

1378
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,310
Eat your buns!

1379
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,050
Oh, fuck.

1380
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,450
That's not what I wanted to do.

1381
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,530
Alright, that's fine.

1382
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,150
Everybody, keep eating your buns!

1383
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,230
Guys, please!

1384
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,550
It's one of me, everyone!

1385
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,550
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1386
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:43,610
Don't worry, I got you.

1387
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:50,130
Okay.

1388
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:51,930
I'm heading over.

1389
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,430
Don't worry, Guardian!

1390
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,030
Eat your buns!

1391
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:57,670
Eat your buns!

1392
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:58,290
Eat your buns!

1393
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:58,830
Eat your buns!

1394
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:03,110
Arrow!

1395
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:10,090
What do you mean?

1396
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:10,950
I'm like right here.

1397
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:14,490
Oh, god.

1398
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:16,410
Okay, nice.

1399
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,870
Oh, my god.

1400
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:24,130
Why are all my generals so fucking bad?

1401
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:27,490
They're at point D.

1402
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,110
Look, I'm going to the closest point, guys.

1403
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,130
These guys need to eat buns, too.

1404
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,450
I'll get there eventually, guys.

1405
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:38,030
Guys, there's a line.

1406
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,010
There's a line for the Guardians of Peace, guys.

1407
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:44,230
Oh, my god.

1408
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:44,710
Please.

1409
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,910
There's a fucking line!

1410
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:51,930
There's only one match for peaceful resistance!

1411
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:55,450
Okay, nice.

1412
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,510
Oh, fuck.

1413
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,870
Oh, shit.

1414
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,450
Oh, shit.

1415
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,410
Okay, we might have to...

1416
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,810
Oh, okay, Guanyin's dead.

1417
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:06,630
Okay, my bad.

1418
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:08,350
My bad.

1419
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,390
Okay, Guanyin might have died, guys.

1420
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:17,510
He died early.

1421
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:18,610
Eat your buns, guys.

1422
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:19,570
Everybody.

1423
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:21,250
Oh, shit.

1424
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:21,550
Lupe.

1425
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,550
Okay.

1426
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:26,070
Oh, we lost Shu!

1427
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:29,330
It's the romance of the two kingdoms now.

1428
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:32,830
Oops.

1429
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:34,910
Oops.

1430
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,550
We just lost the entire Shu army.

1431
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,110
Oh, that's awkward.

1432
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:47,830
That's actually... What do you mean there's not even two brothers?

1433
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,650
Only one brother left.

1434
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,070
I guess I am the last brother, everyone.

1435
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,890
History has changed.

1436
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,030
Whoops.

1437
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,750
Oh, that's awkward.

1438
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:06,930
Yes, there's only one brother.

1439
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:11,810
And where's the...

1440
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:16,950
Wait, where's the... Wait, did they all die to one man?

1441
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,990
Wait, they all died to one guy.

1442
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:22,370
There's three of them.

1443
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:24,550
Wait, what?

1444
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:28,770
They all died to one guy.

1445
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:31,890
Okay.

1446
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,190
Alright, that's not my fault, guys.

1447
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,890
There was literally one man.

1448
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:38,830
Like...

1449
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:43,570
And he... He didn't even have a name, guys.

1450
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,090
He didn't even have a name.

1451
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:50,310
Doki don't understand.

1452
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:53,530
He had the power of the morals.

1453
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,910
But it was one man!

1454
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:01,510
Guan Yin is supposed to be the god of war!

1455
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:05,910
Okay, nice.

1456
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,650
Okay, nice.

1457
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,490
Come on, get out of here.

1458
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:17,450
Get out of here.

1459
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:20,290
This is a fucking gangbang right now.

1460
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,770
We're all here to fucking kill you.

1461
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:25,510
Okay, we got everything.

1462
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,710
This should be... Are you all happy now?

1463
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,430
Are you all happy now?

1464
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,750
We lost you, but you guys are all happy, right?

1465
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,590
Oh god, they're all so low.

1466
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,610
Their HP is all so low, guys.

1467
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,730
Okay.

1468
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,090
That's right.

1469
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,410
Send that arrow in!

1470
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,270
That's fucking right!

1471
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:54,930
Get over here!

1472
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,390
That's fucking right!

1473
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:01,990
I am a one man army!

1474
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:07,730
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1475
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,990
I can't kill Lu Bu, so I guess I'll kill you.

1476
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,090
I'm gonna pretend you're Lu Bu.

1477
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,750
So I can feel something.

1478
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:19,210
So I can roleplay and think I'm better.

1479
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,430
Please take the time to aim your...

1480
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:26,270
No, I'm gonna beat him up into my arrows, guys.

1481
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:28,570
Okay, nice.

1482
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:31,810
Wait, I have rage mode.

1483
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:34,910
I'm gonna use it for this one person.

1484
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:41,230
Just for this one guy.

1485
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:45,130
This guy that obviously is not that important.

1486
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:48,890
That's fucking right.

1487
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:52,190
I need to kill some people, too.

1488
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:56,970
Wait, where did he go?

1489
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:57,970
Where did he go?

1490
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,550
That's right, look how fancy this is.

1491
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:06,670
There's nobody here to kill, but I look so cool.

1492
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:09,210
That was pretty cool, right guys?

1493
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:14,170
That looked pretty cool, right?

1494
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:21,410
Okay, I don't trust the people up top to kill them.

1495
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,350
Oh my god, is our morale okay now?

1496
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,790
I'm fighting my demons, guys.

1497
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,750
I'm just fighting my demons.

1498
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:46,150
Nice.

1499
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:51,070
Gotta kill him now.

1500
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:55,150
Well defended, I just fucking beat the shit out of him.

1501
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,130
That's fucking right.

1502
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:02,350
Get out of here, well defended my ass.

1503
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:06,570
Good job, Shalujan, you did nothing, but you look so cool.

1504
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:12,790
Nice, it's mine now.

1505
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:16,210
Our morals are so high.

1506
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,210
I believe in us.

1507
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:24,070
Let's go!

1508
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,090
Let's go!

1509
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,710
Me and my two kingdoms, there was never a third kingdom.

1510
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:39,410
What do you mean a third kingdom?

1511
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,310
There was never a third kingdom, guys.

1512
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,130
It was always just Wu and Wei.

1513
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:47,490
Okay.

1514
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:53,610
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1515
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,930
Started a duel?

1516
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,570
Wait, what?

1517
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:07,430
How?

1518
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,070
Who fucking dueled me?

1519
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,150
What?

1520
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:14,290
Fight!

1521
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:14,910
Fight!

1522
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,750
What?

1523
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,910
Wait, I can do a 1v1?

1524
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:22,410
The fuck is this?

1525
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,070
Oh my god!

1526
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,930
Okay.

1527
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,850
Wait, that's so cool!

1528
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,910
Guys, do you think he's gonna win?

1529
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:37,250
Guys, I think he fucked up.

1530
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:41,090
Guys, I like how everyone's like, yeah!

1531
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,610
You got this!

1532
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:46,650
You're so- You totally got this, commander!

1533
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:52,750
Yeah, I don't think he's got- I like how they're just all surrounding me!

1534
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:56,270
Everybody was just surrounding me!

1535
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,770
That's so fucking funny!

1536
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,430
Wait, how do I start another duel?

1537
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:03,390
I wanna start another duel!

1538
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,510
Challenge me!

1539
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,330
Nice.

1540
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:13,810
Thank you!

1541
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:16,850
Challenge me!

1542
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,170
Oh shit.

1543
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:27,050
Wait, how do I- Wait, how do I- Oh, are y'all- Oh shit!

1544
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:30,310
I couldn't tell where my spearman was!

1545
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:31,630
Wait, change characters!

1546
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:34,890
That's right, I wanna be cool!

1547
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:38,770
That's fucking right.

1548
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:41,550
Wait.

1549
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,850
Oh my god!

1550
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,730
Wait, can I challenge him?

1551
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,410
No, I can't challenge him and Xiaohu died!

1552
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,450
I'm gonna be angry!

1553
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,730
That's fucking right!

1554
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:57,090
Oh!

1555
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:58,070
Oh!

1556
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:05,270
God, I'm so fucking cool!

1557
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:07,910
I'm so cool!

1558
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,090
Behold!

1559
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:21,490
God, I wish I- Honestly, the only thing I wish was that- I wish I could just play these guys instead.

1560
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:25,330
Because like- Oh my god!

1561
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:27,150
That's me.

1562
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:28,590
Oh!

1563
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:33,510
Oh shit!

1564
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:36,570
I just killed 400 people!

1565
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:42,370
That's like my only gripe about this game.

1566
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:45,090
Is that I can't play as Xiaohu Dun.

1567
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,470
That's like my only gripe.

1568
01:31:50,530 --> 01:31:53,010
I wish I could play as the other characters.

1569
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:55,570
Because I- Oh my god!

1570
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:58,170
They look- Oh my god, they just look so fun!

1571
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:04,970
Yeah, we did it!

1572
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:07,270
I don't know what you did.

1573
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,390
What is he doing?

1574
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,410
Like they're- It was just one guy.

1575
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:14,490
Bro, he used all of that for one guy.

1576
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:19,370
Oh my god, beat him up!

1577
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:20,770
Beat up the one guy!

1578
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:22,290
It's just him!

1579
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,670
Holy shit!

1580
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:25,550
Oh my god, bro!

1581
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:27,030
What the- Duel him.

1582
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,330
I'm dueling him.

1583
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:32,590
That's right.

1584
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:35,090
Oh, really?

1585
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:35,290
Really?

1586
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,550
Yeah, I think he's like the last remaining officer anyway.

1587
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:41,590
I'm pretty sure.

1588
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,910
Of this entire army, he's the last one left alive.

1589
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:56,210
Bro, the fact that like- The fact that like he used that attack for this one guy was pretty fucked up, not gonna lie.

1590
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:01,470
Area 51 raid.

1591
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:02,970
We did it.

1592
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,030
Yeah, there's like no one else left.

1593
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:08,130
It was just him.

1594
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:12,810
He was like, I might be the last man in this army, but I won a 1v1.

1595
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:25,530
Okay, nice.

1596
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:30,770
And slam your- Okay, I don't think I can- I'm gonna pay to win.

1597
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:35,070
I'm gonna pay our relationship therapist to fix my relationship with Shahoodun.

1598
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,100
Nice, plus 46.

1599
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:40,500
Ooh!

1600
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,340
Conquer bases 5 times.

1601
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,320
I killed 12.

1602
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,080
What'd I do?

1603
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:52,100
Collapse 2 times, defeat foes with using a sword.

1604
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,060
Okay, cool.

1605
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,240
Oh, I can upgrade this now.

1606
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,900
Wait, I can have arrows?

1607
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:04,760
How?

1608
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,140
Wait, how do I use arrows?

1609
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:13,100
Wait, what?

1610
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,800
I could've used arrows this entire time?

1611
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,040
Oh, it's a battle art.

1612
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:22,840
I was like, where's my arrow?

1613
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,920
I could've just pulled a gun.

1614
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,160
Who's your jinn?

1615
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:38,460
Who's this guy?

1616
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,220
Why did Lu Bu was the one who challenged you?

1617
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,340
Ooh, I'm fucking dead.

1618
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,080
We all know that.

1619
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,160
I'm dead.

1620
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,200
Zero, thank you for the superchat.

1621
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,360
Thank you, thank you.

1622
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:07,960
Like,

1623
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:13,800
there won't be a 1v1.

1624
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,540
He's literally like 10 men.

1625
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,420
And we're guilty of it too.

1626
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:25,480
But the way we've dithered the whole time, it may no longer be possible to defeat Dong Zhuo.

1627
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:33,870
Only 10?

1628
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:35,550
Hello!

1629
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:39,390
Don't you think Yuan Shu crossed a line back there?

1630
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:44,310
Lord Sun Jian has every right to be furious with him.

1631
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:49,030
He has brought shame upon the House of Yuan with such conduct.

1632
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:56,290
Does Yuan Shu hold a grudge against him?

1633
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:57,010
Hmm.

1634
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:00,670
There's nothing in particular that I'm aware of.

1635
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:04,470
There may be a simpler explanation, for instance.

1636
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:09,110
Perhaps he feels he was deprived of his moment of glory.

1637
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:14,130
If that is the case, then his actions are even more unforgivable.

1638
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:17,130
All of us almost lost our lives.

1639
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,610
Lord Sun Jian is fuming about this incident.

1640
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:22,830
Yeah, nobody died.

1641
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:27,270
I can't wait for my History of the Romance of the Two Kingdoms, guys.

1642
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:30,070
Nobody important died, everybody.

1643
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,410
We were defending the stronghold.

1644
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:04,070
There wasn't time to think about those who rushed barashly out to the front line.

1645
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:05,650
Rushed out?

1646
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:12,610
We may have pushed the vanguard, but we didn't plan to go that far from the stronghold.

1647
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,610
Yeah, the characters are gonna age as we play longer.

1648
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,790
That's why they have no mustaches.

1649
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:18,770
That's why they're babies with no mustaches.

1650
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:24,870
Lord Yuan Shu, let me be very clear.

1651
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:30,390
This is the longest Sun Jian has ever lived for in like 8 games.

1652
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:38,390
I haven't fucking seen Sun Jian live this long in a long time.

1653
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:58,770
If you want to live, that is.

1654
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,040
Damn, that's fucked.

1655
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,220
Um, excuse me, he is a tiger.

1656
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,040
At best, he's gonna meow.

1657
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,720
Oh my god, he is alive!

1658
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:23,240
Yes, that was quite the mark you made.

1659
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,160
Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, you two as well.

1660
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,460
They weren't even in the final battle.

1661
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,900
You guys died to one man.

1662
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,220
They seem to have trouble with cohesion.

1663
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:37,860
Cohesion?

1664
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,380
It was one guy!

1665
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,360
Lord Yuan Shu, arguing during the battle.

1666
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:50,100
And while you'll see some troops praise each other's power, others are berating their ostensible allies over their ancestors.

1667
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,080
That had no name!

1668
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:53,540
The worst part is that general had no name!

1669
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,780
It's hard to imagine things working out.

1670
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:05,000
It is easy to say we're fighters united for a cause, but we must remember that we each have our own motivations.

1671
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:14,120
There are those concerned about the way of the world, those moved by call to act, and those who want to take Dong Zhuo's place.

1672
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:20,220
They squabble simply because they each have a different end goal in mind.

1673
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,480
Hey, come on!

1674
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,060
What's with all this depressing talk, huh?

1675
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,220
We won, didn't we?

1676
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,060
We?

1677
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,540
Where's the we?

1678
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:39,220
You guys only were alive for like 15% of that fight!

1679
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:40,800
You're right, Zhang Fei.

1680
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:44,200
And I really should learn from your outline.

1681
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,160
Where did the we came from?

1682
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,680
Let us rest and prepare for the next battle.

1683
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,360
I don't know about this we business here.

1684
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,800
But you're a sworn fourth brother, Doki!

1685
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,560
Oh, shit!

1686
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:01,980
Oh, shit!

1687
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,820
There's the battle right there!

1688
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:05,420
Oh, fuck!

1689
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,800
Oh, fuck!

1690
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,840
There it is!

1691
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,360
Battle of Hulao Gate!

1692
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,200
Oh, fuck!

1693
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:13,980
Okay.

1694
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,920
Oh my god, we have a fan!

1695
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,520
Ye olde dragoon!

1696
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,120
Oh, I learned a new tactic.

1697
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:23,480
Oh my god, guys!

1698
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,100
I'm making my own dragoon army right now!

1699
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:30,960
Oh my god, who wants to join the dragoons, guys?

1700
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:35,880
Okay, there's nothing new here, though.

1701
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,160
Oh, what's this?

1702
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,000
I haven't unlocked this yet?

1703
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,560
Yeah, I have.

1704
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,740
New tactics can be swapped?

1705
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,020
Oh, I can swap tactics.

1706
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,080
More fodder to feed Lu Bu.

1707
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,320
I have no idea who Yuan Zhen is.

1708
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,040
Is he new?

1709
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,420
But would you accept this?

1710
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,240
I don't know this guy.

1711
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,660
Join me, brothers!

1712
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,200
So we can pursue Lu Bu!

1713
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,740
I don't know who this guy is.

1714
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:08,000
Alright, let me pay my relationship therapist.

1715
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,340
Real quick, guys.

1716
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,140
Can I join after you beat- No!

1717
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:18,300
You can only join when we're fighting Lu Bu.

1718
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,980
That's the true dedication.

1719
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:26,010
Okay, I guess I pay him.

1720
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:28,630
Yay!

1721
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:32,090
My bond grows stronger!

1722
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:37,150
Okay, Li Dian...

1723
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:38,870
Chen Gong...

1724
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:40,950
and then...

1725
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:43,810
Okay, I need to get Chen Gong, Xiaodong, and Li Dian.

1726
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:44,990
Okay, where are they, though?

1727
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,190
Wait, where are they?

1728
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:48,950
They're in the Yang province.

1729
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:50,830
Okay, I need to talk to them in Yang province.

1730
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,560
See, I want to make sure there's no extra stuff here.

1731
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,160
Okay, I need to go to Yang province.

1732
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:05,480
Yang...

1733
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:06,600
Li...

1734
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:07,940
Dian...

1735
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:09,580
Ji...

1736
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:10,460
Yu...

1737
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:12,020
Jin...

1738
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:13,000
The fuck is that?

1739
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:13,940
Yang province!

1740
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:18,260
Wait, where is he?

1741
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:18,980
Oh, there he is.

1742
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,880
Wait, do I not have- Okay, there he is.

1743
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,380
Yu Jin was Cao Cao's best general.

1744
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:31,300
He won every battle he was in, but last- Wait, how come I've never heard of him before?

1745
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,980
How come he- Was he ever a character before?

1746
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,910
Alright, it's time to go on a date.

1747
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:44,610
Finally.

1748
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:48,850
I can get rid of- I finally got rid of Diao Chan.

1749
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:59,750
Oh, it was me?

1750
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,050
I knew paying the relationship therapist would work.

1751
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:04,730
Did something happen?

1752
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:07,590
Finally!

1753
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:09,410
What we're here for!

1754
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:13,550
Poetry, okay.

1755
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:25,490
Wow, that's so romantic.

1756
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,980
Oh shit.

1757
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:35,440
Oh fuck.

1758
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:36,640
Oh man.

1759
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:37,940
What do you think?

1760
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,360
It'll be hot if I'm interested in poetry?

1761
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:44,440
Or do you think it'll be like, that's so hot that you don't care?

1762
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:47,520
Oh no.

1763
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:50,900
Oh, these are actual- Oh my god.

1764
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:51,700
Okay, guys.

1765
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,460
Guys, what do you guys think?

1766
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,780
How do you know if I'm in or not?

1767
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,480
I'm not into it?

1768
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:02,440
Okay, we can't fumble here, guys!

1769
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,040
Guys, we can't fumble it!

1770
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,640
Two?

1771
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:08,620
Not suited- it's so hard.

1772
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:08,980
Okay.

1773
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:09,760
Okay.

1774
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,480
I'm not suited for poetry.

1775
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,240
Oh, think we're relatable!

1776
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,100
Oh my god, things are relatable!

1777
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,940
I made him laugh, guys.

1778
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:30,480
I'm in.

1779
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:36,720
I like how I just invited myself to sit with him.

1780
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:48,940
Oh my god, he's brooding.

1781
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,700
Oh, that's so hot.

1782
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,100
That seems exciting.

1783
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,580
That's so hot, bro.

1784
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,580
We can learn poetry together.

1785
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:17,600
Maybe I'll enjoy fighting more if you fall on side with me.

1786
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:28,020
I'll think about it.

1787
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:29,100
I'm in!

1788
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,220
I'm so in!

1789
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,740
I'm so good at everything, guys!

1790
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:43,400
It's really hard to get.

1791
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:08,500
Bro, I don't even need to try to risk the girls.

1792
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,580
The girls don't even give me an option.

1793
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:12,860
It's like, yes or yes.

1794
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,960
But when I talk to the guys, I actually have to think about my responses.

1795
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:22,460
Even when I say no to the girls, the girls give me another choice and be like, you can't say no.

1796
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,320
You have to say yes.

1797
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:29,040
Like, the girls have like zero options.

1798
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,200
Like, I don't even need to try.

1799
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,640
There's no challenge.

1800
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:36,660
There's actually no challenge when I talk to the girls.

1801
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:47,010
Tell him he's the apple of your eye.

1802
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:48,610
Avoid Don.

1803
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:50,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1804
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,490
Thank you, thank you.

1805
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:55,010
Alright, there you go.

1806
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,950
There's Chen Gong.

1807
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:58,130
Roses are red.

1808
01:46:58,330 --> 01:46:59,090
Violets are blue.

1809
01:46:59,230 --> 01:47:01,930
Doki Bird must not pursue Lu Bu.

1810
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:03,470
Claude, thank you for the super chat.

1811
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:04,450
Thank you, thank you.

1812
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,690
Avoid Don.

1813
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,410
Thank you for the super chat.

1814
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:07,050
Thank you, thank you.

1815
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,790
Tell him he's the apple of your eye.

1816
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:09,830
It's me.

1817
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:12,630
They say you're a warrior who sells your skills with blade.

1818
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:14,310
I have a request for you.

1819
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:15,770
You accept it, won't you?

1820
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:19,070
Prevention of... I don't care about Chen Gong enough.

1821
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:20,270
Let's just go to Hulao Gate.

1822
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:21,470
We'll do his quest later.

1823
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:23,250
Where's Hulao Gate?

1824
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:24,970
Oh, Hulao Gate is right there.

1825
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:31,910
Oh my god, look at all the poets in the chat.

1826
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:35,150
I got another old coin.

1827
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:43,430
Wait, what?

1828
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:46,110
I joined TaoTao for Cheng He?

1829
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:49,470
I was not... he spent the night in my bed?

1830
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:50,970
Wait, really?

1831
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:51,110
What?

1832
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:55,170
I did not know that was possible.

1833
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:58,410
Wait, what?

1834
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:00,750
Wait, is that true?

1835
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:03,490
Oh, wow.

1836
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:09,630
To be fair, Guan Yu invited us to his bed.

1837
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:10,490
Yes, I say us.

1838
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:11,350
We were all there.

1839
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,030
We were all there.

1840
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:15,690
Alright, it's time to pursue Lu Bu, guys.

1841
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:17,450
It's fucking time.

1842
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,600
Just the two of us.

1843
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:29,660
Just the two of us.

1844
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,980
We were all there.

1845
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:41,400
There's an enormous structure that provides a strong defensive position for Dong Zhuo.

1846
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:43,840
Yet, place his forces there to make it stand.

1847
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:48,960
When the enemy stands before us, waiting to be defeated, we'll crush them with our combined forces.

1848
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,680
Our interim leader is the pillar holding up the coalition.

1849
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:56,660
We must beware not to allow the enemy to reach our headquarters.

1850
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:58,800
I'll now give each of you your orders.

1851
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,460
I can confirm.

1852
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:06,700
Cheng He and I read Tao Tao's poems in the same bed.

1853
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,840
Thank you for the super chat.

1854
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,100
Thank you, thank you.

1855
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,820
Guys, you know, that's what bro-homies do.

1856
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:17,200
That's what the bros do.

1857
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:19,340
Read each other poems, guys.

1858
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:20,960
You read your bro.

1859
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,840
You'd read a poem for your bro, right?

1860
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,900
Concentrating our forces in front of the gate will be essential.

1861
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:30,920
Every army should start the battle by heading for that position.

1862
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:37,300
Our forces will approach from all directions to eliminate the troops guarding the gate and every group to begin our final assault on Dong Zhuo.

1863
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:40,140
We have now prepared Taobots for our siege.

1864
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:43,440
If we use them well, they will make short work of the gate's defenses.

1865
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,460
But Hu Lao's gate is not the only arrow in Dong Zhuo's quiver.

1866
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:54,100
He also has the peerless warrior Lu Bu, a man with power enough to turn the tide of the battle on his own.

1867
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,060
We cannot be sure what he will do, so we will have to be ready for anything.

1868
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:59,280
But take care of that.

1869
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:02,360
My men and I will keep that demon from wreaking too much havoc.

1870
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,160
I see that Lu Bei's forces are at your command, Lord Zhang.

1871
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:07,800
How formidable.

1872
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:08,600
Very well.

1873
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,760
Take up the rearguard.

1874
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,800
Loyal subjects of the Han, this is where we bury the evil Dong Zhuo.

1875
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,780
Seize this victory and restore order to the realm!

1876
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:20,260
Nice, I have Xiaohu Dun with me.

1877
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,760
This is where he loses his eye, guys.

1878
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:24,880
It's gonna be so cool.

1879
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,850
Me and my homies with our poetry stand.

1880
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:36,590
Alright, guys.

1881
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:38,070
It's time.

1882
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,990
We go this way?

1883
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:41,270
I don't know.

1884
01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:42,350
I'm just gonna go down.

1885
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:45,510
Get over there.

1886
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:46,950
Open that gate.

1887
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:54,310
Darkblade, thank you for the superchat.

1888
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:55,190
Thank you, thank you.

1889
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:57,930
I volunteer as the Joji Dragon Warrior.

1890
01:50:58,270 --> 01:50:59,490
Please don't kill me.

1891
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:06,930
Guys, we all have to work together to defeat Lu Bu, guys.

1892
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:08,210
This is a team effort.

1893
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:10,430
You're not just gonna ditch me, right?

1894
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:12,450
When we fight Lu Bu?

1895
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:20,330
Guys, if we throw enough men into Lu Bu, he'll surely die, right?

1896
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,970
Right, guys?

1897
01:51:22,130 --> 01:51:23,310
Surely he'll get tired.

1898
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:27,250
He'll get tired eventually, right?

1899
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:31,430
Right, guys?

1900
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:35,650
Eventually.

1901
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:38,010
Okay, eat your bread.

1902
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:38,550
Eat your bread.

1903
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:40,010
Eat your bread.

1904
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:46,230
I can take him.

1905
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:49,110
Okay, nice.

1906
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:49,750
Broke it.

1907
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:55,730
I'm close!

1908
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:57,470
Thank you for the superchat.

1909
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:58,610
Thank you, thank you.

1910
01:51:58,950 --> 01:52:01,150
Poetry Slam with the homies.

1911
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:03,870
But it's not the poetry getting slammed.

1912
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:05,690
Oh my god.

1913
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:06,910
Poetry and chill.

1914
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:13,610
Before Netflix was born, me and my homies used to do poetry and slam.

1915
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:17,530
Such great strength.

1916
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:23,170
Oh shit, what the fuck?

1917
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:26,030
What the fuck is going on?

1918
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:28,690
Damn, bro.

1919
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:30,170
Changiao!

1920
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:31,270
Changiao!

1921
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:34,330
Oh my god.

1922
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:38,110
Wait, is a duel of pikes good against Lu Bu?

1923
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,710
Me and Lu.

1924
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:44,370
Oh my god, he's so cool.

1925
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:45,670
Holy shit.

1926
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,650
Okay, I told you guys, right?

1927
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:53,110
My like... I had a crush on Changiao.

1928
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:56,770
Okay, wait.

1929
01:52:56,850 --> 01:52:57,330
Give me a sec.

1930
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:58,390
Ma Chao.

1931
01:52:59,130 --> 01:52:59,730
Oh shit.

1932
01:53:00,130 --> 01:53:00,770
Okay, guys.

1933
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:01,190
I can't.

1934
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:02,310
Sorry, guys.

1935
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:03,610
I need to focus right now.

1936
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:05,270
He is very, very strong.

1937
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:10,730
Did you call Lu Bu?

1938
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:15,790
Before they made him a baby face?

1939
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:18,210
And then I was like, oh my god, he's ugly now.

1940
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:22,470
Oh my god, he's a baby now.

1941
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,310
I can't.

1942
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:24,190
Oh shit.

1943
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:25,990
Oh shit, what the?

1944
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:27,590
Oh fuck.

1945
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:33,350
Oh my god, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

1946
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,990
Oh, I don't have any bread left.

1947
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:41,350
Jesus Christ.

1948
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:44,110
Guys, I might actually die.

1949
01:53:44,830 --> 01:53:45,850
Guys, I can't.

1950
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:46,290
I can't.

1951
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:46,950
I can't focus.

1952
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,530
Holy shit!

1953
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:54,030
Oh my god.

1954
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:55,130
My heart.

1955
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:57,270
My heart is beating.

1956
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:00,930
Guys, I actually might die.

1957
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:09,650
Oh my- He's so strong!

1958
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:12,090
What the fuck?

1959
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:16,590
Oh my god.

1960
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:21,350
Holy shit, he's so- Okay, okay, okay.

1961
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:22,650
Okay, guys.

1962
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:24,190
I don't know if I can beat Lu Bu.

1963
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:27,050
I can't even beat his fucking minion.

1964
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:30,470
Holy shit.

1965
01:54:31,170 --> 01:54:33,070
Okay, okay, I'm gonna full focus.

1966
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:36,110
I'm gonna full focus right now.

1967
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:40,010
Okay, we got full focus here.

1968
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:43,810
Jesus Christ, he was so strong.

1969
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:46,370
I can't even defeat his henchman.

1970
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:48,590
I don't know if I can defeat Lu Bu.

1971
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:54,090
Oh my god.

1972
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:57,290
Okay, nice.

1973
01:54:58,050 --> 01:54:58,330
Alright.

1974
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:00,130
Bam.

1975
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:01,910
Alright, there he's gonna come over now.

1976
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,790
Okay, I'm scared, guys.

1977
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:06,150
I'm so scared.

1978
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:10,370
Oh, I have to lock in.

1979
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:11,430
I actually have to lock in.

1980
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,970
Alright, I'ma lock in right here.

1981
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:21,270
Nice.

1982
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:24,690
Ooh!

1983
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:25,710
Okay.

1984
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:29,270
Like, when he does his dash, it's so scary.

1985
01:55:30,730 --> 01:55:32,330
His dash is so scary.

1986
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:34,310
Holy shit, his dash does the most damage.

1987
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:40,050
I need to, like, be able to- Oh my god, what the fuck?

1988
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:43,010
Whoa!

1989
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:45,050
Whoa!

1990
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:48,370
Oh god!

1991
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:49,930
Oh, I just have to jump!

1992
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:53,630
Jesus Christ.

1993
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:57,170
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1994
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:57,850
I broke his shield.

1995
01:55:59,270 --> 01:56:01,110
Okay, I'm going full focus.

1996
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:06,190
Guys, I have to defeat his fucking henchman first before we pursue Lu Bu.

1997
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:11,370
Oh, I fucked up the arrow!

1998
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:15,270
Okay, I'm gonna take him to the arrow, guys.

1999
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:16,490
Guys, I fucked up.

2000
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:17,970
I fucked up the arrow.

2001
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,090
Oh, whoops.

2002
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:21,450
God, fuck!

2003
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:24,110
Okay, nice.

2004
01:56:30,230 --> 01:56:32,410
Oh, I'm focusing so hard right now.

2005
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:34,530
Nice!

2006
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:35,250
Counter!

2007
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:36,210
Nice!

2008
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:38,790
Okay.

2009
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:40,890
He's so close to dying.

2010
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:42,270
Please, he's one hit!

2011
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,930
He's one hit!

2012
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:44,530
Nice!

2013
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:44,930
Counter!

2014
01:56:45,610 --> 01:56:46,390
That's right!

2015
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:50,630
Oh my god, I got the pike.

2016
01:56:53,010 --> 01:56:55,130
Oh, that is so fucking intense.

2017
01:56:57,950 --> 01:56:58,890
Alright, but yes.

2018
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:00,750
Okay, here was my list when I was younger.

2019
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:02,190
When I was a little bird.

2020
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:10,290
It was like Cheng Liao, Ma Chao, because he was so fucking cool with his helmet.

2021
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:11,630
Zhuge Liang.

2022
01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:19,230
Lu Bei, before I realized, he was just like, he was like, you know...

2023
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:20,910
How do I explain him?

2024
01:57:21,730 --> 01:57:25,810
He was like, all talk, but like a failure as a person.

2025
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:30,830
And then they shaved off his mustache, and I was like, oh man, he's a fucking baby.

2026
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:31,530
Like...

2027
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:40,390
Ma Chao was a monster IRL, but he looked cool!

2028
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:42,710
But he looked so cool!

2029
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:49,890
It is not my fault that they, like, um, um, what's his name?

2030
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,850
Oh my god.

2031
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:56,170
It was not my fault that, oh my god, who is, what's the poster child's name again?

2032
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:57,330
Fuck, is it Cheng Liao?

2033
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:59,650
Okay, it's, it's, oh my god.

2034
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:04,910
Oh my god, I already forgot his name because he hasn't appeared in so long.

2035
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:15,370
Zhao Yun, it's not my fault that, like, after Zhao Yun, they, Ma Chao was like the second poster child.

2036
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:21,550
I don't know if you guys remember that, but if they can't use Zhao Yun, they use Ma Chao.

2037
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:24,110
Because he looked so cool, okay?

2038
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:29,270
Zhao, Ma Chao was like the second poster child after Zhao Yun.

2039
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:34,290
And, like, I honestly thought he was cooler than Zhao Yun, um, the way they made his design.

2040
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:40,990
Anyway, look, he might be a monster IRL, but, like, but he was so cool though.

2041
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:48,670
Yeah, um, okay.

2042
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:52,470
And then, no, I think Xiao Hu Dan was the third poster.

2043
01:58:52,630 --> 01:59:00,590
I think, I think the rankings was, um, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and then Xiao Hu Dan.

2044
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:09,010
I think that was, like, the ranking, rankings of, like, how, like, the, the, the preferential treatment that they gave the characters.

2045
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:12,350
Um, and then everybody else was, like, whatever.

2046
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:17,470
But, like, those were my favorite characters.

2047
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:23,870
Okay, well, thank God.

2048
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:25,350
Thank God he's fucking dead.

2049
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,090
Holy shit, he was so scary.

2050
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:29,970
Okay, is this, is this weapon strong?

2051
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:32,890
I don't know if this weapon is strong.

2052
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:34,110
Which is stronger?

2053
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:35,610
For Lu Bu.

2054
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:39,390
Which one should I use against Lu Bu?

2055
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:41,110
The Pykes or the, um...

2056
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:44,530
I don't know which is stronger.

2057
01:59:49,930 --> 01:59:55,510
Is this stronger than the, uh, is this better for, oh shit.

2058
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:57,650
Is this better against Lu Bu?

2059
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:04,550
Guys, I need to know which one's better against Lu Bu, guys.

2060
02:00:08,010 --> 02:00:10,790
Because, like, we are at Hulao Gate right now.

2061
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:13,830
Jesus Christ.

2062
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:19,710
Jesus, what?!

2063
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:21,910
How am I not there?!

2064
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:24,070
Okay, nice.

2065
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,170
Jesus Christ, they're all so strong.

2066
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:32,790
Who do I have to help?

2067
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:36,650
Jesus Christ, how are you guys?

2068
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:38,130
Okay, we gotta go up.

2069
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:43,190
Okay.

2070
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:49,170
The strongest weapon against Lu Bu is surrender.

2071
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:51,950
We will pursue Lu Bu.

2072
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:53,970
Please, I'm heading over.

2073
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:57,310
I'm heading over as fast as I can.

2074
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:00,910
Okay, I'm ready.

2075
02:01:02,490 --> 02:01:03,510
Wait, you guys won.

2076
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:04,830
Wait, what the fuck?

2077
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:07,030
Wait, you guys won.

2078
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:08,790
I didn't even have to be there.

2079
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:11,890
Wait, what?

2080
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:12,410
What?

2081
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:13,990
I didn't even have to be there.

2082
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:17,830
Oh my god, they all did it.

2083
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:19,170
What was the point of me being here?

2084
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:21,590
I guess I can take this gate, though.

2085
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:27,670
Okay.

2086
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:31,370
I still don't know which- Oh wait, I should've- Actually, I just remembered.

2087
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,670
I should've- I forgot to put something for this.

2088
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:38,150
Oh wait, we should get the fire arrows.

2089
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:43,010
Okay.

2090
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:49,110
Oh damn it, I can't- It's so hard to do counters for this one.

2091
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:54,190
Okay, nice.

2092
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:55,990
I don't know what I did.

2093
02:01:56,170 --> 02:01:56,910
Was that the counter?

2094
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:01,130
Did I do the counter?

2095
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:02,030
I can't tell!

2096
02:02:02,490 --> 02:02:04,450
This is my first time with the Pykes!

2097
02:02:07,610 --> 02:02:08,290
Okay, nice.

2098
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:09,850
Oh my god, it's someone's birthday?

2099
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:12,190
Okay, I wish them happy birthday after I kill Lu Bu.

2100
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:12,730
Don't worry.

2101
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:13,850
Don't worry.

2102
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:16,550
Your birthday gift is me killing Lu Bu.

2103
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:16,650
Oh.

2104
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:21,430
Okay, nice.

2105
02:02:24,230 --> 02:02:25,510
Oh my god, we're getting closer.

2106
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:28,150
We're getting closer to Hulao Gate, guys.

2107
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:29,910
We're almost there.

2108
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:35,830
Wait, where?

2109
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:38,950
So many gates.

2110
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,090
Nice.

2111
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:48,290
Come on.

2112
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:50,270
Come on!

2113
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:51,990
I wanna beat Xiaohu Du!

2114
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:54,710
Oh shit!

2115
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:55,490
Nice.

2116
02:02:58,570 --> 02:02:58,850
Okay.

2117
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:02,530
My only goal is to beat Xiaohu Du!

2118
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:08,830
God, I'm so scared.

2119
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:11,570
We're getting closer and closer to Lu Bu.

2120
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:14,530
No way out.

2121
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:17,770
You'll only get your happy birthday until we beat Lu Bu.

2122
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:19,090
I don't know.

2123
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:24,610
I can't get the timing for the counter right with the Peek Pykes.

2124
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:26,030
It's so weird.

2125
02:03:26,910 --> 02:03:27,710
Oh fuck!

2126
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:29,050
I actually used my circle!

2127
02:03:32,090 --> 02:03:33,130
God damn it.

2128
02:03:34,890 --> 02:03:37,790
The Pyke is so hard to do the...

2129
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:40,650
do the counter.

2130
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:45,170
It's like... it's such a weird... I don't know.

2131
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:48,250
It's such a weird timing for this one.

2132
02:03:50,910 --> 02:03:52,510
Yeah, he's almost dead though.

2133
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:53,550
Nice.

2134
02:03:54,890 --> 02:03:56,050
That's fucking right.

2135
02:04:00,130 --> 02:04:03,330
Oh, I can climb up?

2136
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,710
Oh my god.

2137
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:07,910
How do I do it?

2138
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:12,870
Wait, where is he?

2139
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:15,070
Who am I protecting?

2140
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:22,010
Who am I protecting?

2141
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:24,650
Where is he?

2142
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:30,730
Wait, what the fuck?

2143
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:32,650
How am I so far away?

2144
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:35,930
This weapon is so long!

2145
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:37,690
How did I miss?

2146
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:48,250
He's right next to me!

2147
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:56,190
That doesn't make sense!

2148
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:00,690
I don't know how I could miss.

2149
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:02,170
Like, he was right there.

2150
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:06,410
How did I miss?

2151
02:05:06,490 --> 02:05:07,970
He was right there.

2152
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:10,150
I don't understand.

2153
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:12,210
Oh my god!

2154
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:15,930
Changmiao, please, for the love of god!

2155
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:23,070
Changmiao, please!

2156
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:26,570
Eat your bread!

2157
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:27,190
Eat your bread!

2158
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:28,230
Oh, thank god!

2159
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:30,470
I was like... it was like pure cinema.

2160
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:34,550
Holy shit, that was actual pure cinema, guys.

2161
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:39,470
He was one hit from, like, dying and I got in there and he ate his bread.

2162
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:44,350
I did it.

2163
02:05:44,390 --> 02:05:45,030
I'm a hero.

2164
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:48,090
I'm actually a hero.

2165
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:00,150
He's coming!

2166
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:04,230
He's coming!

2167
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:05,630
I hear him!

2168
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:07,930
Oh no!

2169
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:12,110
Oh, I'm scared!

2170
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:14,830
Oh my god, he already killed a man!

2171
02:06:15,730 --> 02:06:16,890
What the fuck?

2172
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:18,450
What do you mean two already died?

2173
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:19,870
Three died?

2174
02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:21,150
Okay, I'm fucking...

2175
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:26,650
Guys, I don't... guys, I can't... I'm not good with the twin peak, I've realized.

2176
02:06:29,970 --> 02:06:31,110
Where is he?

2177
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:32,830
Oh shit!

2178
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:34,110
There he is!

2179
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:35,490
Oh my god!

2180
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:40,130
What the fuck?

2181
02:06:40,210 --> 02:06:40,210
What the fuck?

2182
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:42,230
He's just...

2183
02:06:42,230 --> 02:06:44,050
Bro, he's just on his horse!

2184
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:52,210
You can't even get him off his horse!

2185
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:58,650
Bro!

2186
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:03,170
Like, how do I get him off his horse?

2187
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:05,490
No!

2188
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:08,210
That's so fun!

2189
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,220
He doesn't even get off his horse!

2190
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:15,560
I'm just gonna kill this guy.

2191
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,980
Okay, let me just kill him.

2192
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,060
Let me just...

2193
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:21,860
Let me just feel good.

2194
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:22,960
Okay.

2195
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,940
Bro, he doesn't even get off his horse!

2196
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,900
He pays one red hair!

2197
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:40,460
Okay.

2198
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:45,480
Okay.

2199
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:50,320
Okay, guys, someone get him off his horse and then maybe I can help you.

2200
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:53,540
And then maybe I can do something.

2201
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:00,780
Oh shit!

2202
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,320
Wait, can I actually get him off his horse?

2203
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:07,600
Oh my god, someone!

2204
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,640
Oh my god!

2205
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:18,100
He's still on his horse!

2206
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:22,900
Wait, I got an idea!

2207
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:24,140
Shao Chun!

2208
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:28,320
This is it!

2209
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,660
I might...

2210
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:33,960
Oh my god, maybe this is not it.

2211
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,620
This is it.

2212
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:41,260
Maybe we can do this, Shao Chun!

2213
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,240
Maybe we can do this together!

2214
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:46,660
Maybe it's just...

2215
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,680
Oh my god, we got him off his horse!

2216
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:50,960
Let's go!

2217
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:59,280
With the power of Shao Chun, he got back on his horse?!

2218
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,640
That should be illegal!

2219
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,540
What?!

2220
02:09:06,020 --> 02:09:07,420
No!

2221
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:08,880
No!

2222
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:17,060
He just ran away!

2223
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:21,460
He just ran away!

2224
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,620
That's not fair!

2225
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:27,880
That's not fair!

2226
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:35,700
He just ran!

2227
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:37,260
Bro!

2228
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,020
Oh my god!

2229
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:48,520
Oh my god, I'm like one third!

2230
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,580
Like, I'm only one third!

2231
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:55,060
Like, what do I do?!

2232
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:55,400
Bro!

2233
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,980
I have buns left!

2234
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:02,360
I don't have any buns left, guys!

2235
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:08,440
Bro!

2236
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:10,260
Bro!

2237
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,020
Oh my god, I got him off my horse!

2238
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:21,020
Guys!

2239
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:23,140
I got one third!

2240
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:24,840
Guys, I did it!

2241
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:26,220
It's...

2242
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,460
Guys...

2243
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:43,400
Guys, I don't know if I can kill a little fella, guys!

2244
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:48,520
Guys, it's not fair!

2245
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:51,040
He's on his horse!

2246
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,600
He's not even...

2247
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:57,600
Like, how is this fair?!

2248
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:01,600
Like, what the fuck?!

2249
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:06,100
Like, he's just on his horse!

2250
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:08,080
Oh my god, I got him off his horse, though.

2251
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,260
Oh my god.

2252
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:16,560
Oh my god, he's Sierra's.

2253
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:17,460
Goodbye!

2254
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:23,220
Like, he just called his horse back and that should be so illegal!

2255
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:26,080
Like, he just gets on his horse?!

2256
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:32,460
How could they let him do that?!

2257
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,520
Jesus Christ!

2258
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:43,760
Oh my god.

2259
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:48,780
How did he beat somebody that's just on his horse?!

2260
02:11:56,420 --> 02:12:02,080
Nobody warned me about Lu Bu's horse to ground missile.

2261
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,760
Like, what the fuck?!

2262
02:12:07,140 --> 02:12:08,980
Jesus Christ!

2263
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:10,540
Jesus!

2264
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:14,140
Here we go!

2265
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:15,680
Fire arrows!

2266
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:19,960
There's no way he's gonna move, right?!

2267
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,780
He just gets back on it!

2268
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:24,340
That should be so illegal!

2269
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,420
Like, who gave...

2270
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:30,460
This should be like, Final Destination, no horses!

2271
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:35,660
Okay, nice.

2272
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:40,480
Oh my god.

2273
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:43,340
Jesus Christ.

2274
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:45,720
Oh my god, the missile!

2275
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:48,620
The fucking missile!

2276
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:49,700
Bro!

2277
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,200
It's not fair!

2278
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:54,000
He sends a missile!

2279
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:57,000
Okay.

2280
02:12:59,260 --> 02:12:59,540
Okay.

2281
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,100
What do you mean?!

2282
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:07,340
You work for me, Dracos!

2283
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,780
What do you mean you're gonna run?!

2284
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,460
We're in this together!

2285
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:20,100
Oh my god, even you guys left me.

2286
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,440
That's so fucked.

2287
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:23,340
You wanted me to fucking...

2288
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:29,340
You wanted me to kill Lu Bu and you run away?!

2289
02:13:32,140 --> 02:13:33,800
The fuck happened?!

2290
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:39,960
Oh my god.

2291
02:13:41,860 --> 02:13:44,340
What the fuck?!

2292
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,080
Oh my god.

2293
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:50,780
I don't know if I'm doing anything.

2294
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:53,260
I feel like I'm just...

2295
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:57,340
I don't know that I do anything?!

2296
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,120
Oh my god!

2297
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:09,820
Oh my god!

2298
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,920
We got to phase 2!

2299
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,160
Oh, fuck!

2300
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:23,000
Guys, we got to phase 2 though!

2301
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:27,240
Jesus Christ.

2302
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,940
Holy fuck.

2303
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:35,500
We're spirits are aroused!

2304
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:38,540
Okay, nice.

2305
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:42,320
Oh, nice!

2306
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,580
Okay.

2307
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:47,000
We're back here.

2308
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:49,200
It did not check point.

2309
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,880
But like, fuck me I guess.

2310
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:58,340
Nice.

2311
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:03,440
Oh my god, please!

2312
02:15:03,740 --> 02:15:04,160
No!

2313
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:04,800
Fuck!

2314
02:15:05,660 --> 02:15:08,800
Oh my god, you left again?!

2315
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:11,880
No!

2316
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,460
It's so hard!

2317
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:21,080
Oh my god, it's so difficult!

2318
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:26,040
We will... we can do this, guys.

2319
02:15:26,380 --> 02:15:28,200
We can kill Lu Bu!

2320
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:28,380
No!

2321
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:34,940
Oh my god!

2322
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:38,260
Please, stop resisting!

2323
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:43,880
Stop resisting, I'm here for peace!

2324
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,260
Stop resisting!

2325
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:50,700
This is for peace!

2326
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,240
Okay.

2327
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:00,400
Jesus Christ.

2328
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,840
Oh, fuck!

2329
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:03,100
Oh, fuck!

2330
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:07,660
Oh no, he's doing his fucking nuclear bomb!

2331
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:14,180
Jesus.

2332
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:16,900
No, I dodged it.

2333
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:20,060
You fucking coward, Chat.

2334
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:25,100
Okay.

2335
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,840
Bro, he just keeps running now!

2336
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:31,720
Yes, I did the perfect dodge.

2337
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:32,600
Okay.

2338
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:35,980
Okay, I got him off!

2339
02:16:37,740 --> 02:16:39,900
Okay, he's almost at half HP, guys!

2340
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:42,860
I almost got him to half HP!

2341
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:49,640
I hate him.

2342
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:50,780
I hate him.

2343
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:52,560
He just rides away.

2344
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:55,400
I hate him so much.

2345
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:57,300
Okay, nice.

2346
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:00,220
Oh, fuck!

2347
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,160
Am I... what am I doing?

2348
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:07,620
Where am I?

2349
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:12,680
Okay, phase two.

2350
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:16,560
Oh my god, no!

2351
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:16,860
Oh

2352
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:32,840
my god, why don't I have a checkpoint for phase two?

2353
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:37,180
Oh my...

2354
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,180
Holy shit.

2355
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:45,260
I feel like I should have a... I feel like I should have a checkpoint for phase two.

2356
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:51,980
This shit... this shit is so fucked up.

2357
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:58,730
Oh my god.

2358
02:17:59,690 --> 02:18:00,250
Please!

2359
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:03,590
Please!

2360
02:18:04,210 --> 02:18:06,530
I'm standing you as much as I can!

2361
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:12,850
Okay, I'm gonna get more buns right here.

2362
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:14,430
JK.

2363
02:18:16,310 --> 02:18:16,870
Nice!

2364
02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:17,870
Perfect dodge.

2365
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:20,190
Okay, I'm figuring out his patterns, guys.

2366
02:18:20,190 --> 02:18:21,530
Oh, fuck!

2367
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:26,350
Guys, I'll be right back.

2368
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:27,870
Guys, don't die.

2369
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:30,350
Guys, don't die.

2370
02:18:30,470 --> 02:18:31,950
There's buns right here, guys.

2371
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:33,170
Don't die, guys.

2372
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:35,390
Gotta find the buns.

2373
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:37,370
Wait, where's the buns?

2374
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:40,330
There it is.

2375
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:45,970
Okay, I refilled.

2376
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:49,350
Alright, I'm coming back.

2377
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:49,950
Don't worry.

2378
02:18:50,330 --> 02:18:51,610
Don't worry, guys.

2379
02:18:53,870 --> 02:18:55,050
This is not cheating!

2380
02:18:55,690 --> 02:18:58,250
Guys, it's fucking Lu Bu, guys!

2381
02:18:59,290 --> 02:19:00,490
It's not cheating!

2382
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:02,290
It's literally Lu Bu!

2383
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:09,310
That's fucking right.

2384
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:14,410
That's fucking right!

2385
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:17,350
I got buns now!

2386
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:21,790
That's right!

2387
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:24,350
Get buns!

2388
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:25,770
Get buns!

2389
02:19:26,970 --> 02:19:28,290
I can do this.

2390
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:30,570
Oh my god, he's too far away.

2391
02:19:30,610 --> 02:19:31,790
I can't break dance near him.

2392
02:19:32,290 --> 02:19:34,570
No, he's too far away!

2393
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:38,350
He's too far away from my break dance!

2394
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:42,550
Wait, this is possible.

2395
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:45,190
Wait, oh my god.

2396
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:47,070
I'm sorry, I got too cocky.

2397
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:49,590
Oh my god, I got too cocky.

2398
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:51,390
Maybe not.

2399
02:19:52,750 --> 02:19:54,250
I didn't remember to die.

2400
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:57,530
Oh my god!

2401
02:19:58,950 --> 02:20:00,550
Why can't I...

2402
02:20:02,830 --> 02:20:04,630
Can you not counter him?

2403
02:20:05,830 --> 02:20:07,270
Can you not counter?

2404
02:20:11,190 --> 02:20:13,010
Oh my... wait.

2405
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:16,430
No!

2406
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,990
Oh my god.

2407
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:23,250
I thought I could counter him.

2408
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:27,550
I didn't realize it's uncounterable.

2409
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:30,610
Okay, okay.

2410
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:33,070
Oh, you can?

2411
02:20:33,570 --> 02:20:35,290
Okay, clearly I don't know how.

2412
02:20:36,590 --> 02:20:38,190
Oh, I fucked up my arrow.

2413
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:39,570
The first time.

2414
02:20:41,230 --> 02:20:44,410
Wait, did he just... what the fuck, he just ran off.

2415
02:20:45,950 --> 02:20:47,730
Wait, he just ran so far.

2416
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:52,950
Jesus Christ.

2417
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:55,870
Okay.

2418
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:57,610
Okay.

2419
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:59,710
I'm gonna get him.

2420
02:21:03,070 --> 02:21:04,890
Okay, that's fine.

2421
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:09,250
No, I used the right... fuck, okay.

2422
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:11,290
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine, I got him off the horse.

2423
02:21:12,270 --> 02:21:14,170
Oh, I got him off the horse, that's okay.

2424
02:21:20,910 --> 02:21:21,270
Woo!

2425
02:21:23,130 --> 02:21:24,230
Okay, that's fine, that's fine.

2426
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:30,190
This is fine, this is fine, we're all okay.

2427
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:31,750
We got him off the horse.

2428
02:21:34,510 --> 02:21:37,510
Okay, after this I'm gonna get bread.

2429
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:39,630
Okay, goodbye.

2430
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:43,410
Oh, phase two.

2431
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:46,310
Phase two, I get bread now.

2432
02:21:48,990 --> 02:21:50,550
Phase two is bread time.

2433
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:56,450
I believe in them for surviving a little longer when I get the bread.

2434
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,410
Okay.

2435
02:21:59,910 --> 02:22:01,310
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

2436
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:02,630
Don't worry.

2437
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:05,430
I just needed to grab bread.

2438
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:09,030
It's fine.

2439
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:12,410
Please, this is important.

2440
02:22:14,390 --> 02:22:16,050
We're gonna kill Lu Bu.

2441
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:19,290
Okay, Cao Cao's dead, but we're gonna kill him though.

2442
02:22:22,050 --> 02:22:23,130
Jesus Christ.

2443
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:29,930
Oh my god!

2444
02:22:29,930 --> 02:22:30,090
Okay.

2445
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:38,370
Jesus Christ, I can't dodge it!

2446
02:22:39,850 --> 02:22:42,270
He does like two attacks!

2447
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:45,210
Come on.

2448
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:48,930
What the fuck?!

2449
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:52,110
I- I can't!

2450
02:22:52,210 --> 02:22:53,630
I can't dodge it!

2451
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:57,930
I like- how do I dodge that?

2452
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:03,930
Like, I can do this dodge?!

2453
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:09,170
Jesus Christ!

2454
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:13,810
I don't know how to dodge that!

2455
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:17,170
Oh!

2456
02:23:23,470 --> 02:23:25,290
Dodge one parry or block?

2457
02:23:25,850 --> 02:23:27,350
Is that how you do it?

2458
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:31,050
I think he's gonna come this way.

2459
02:23:33,350 --> 02:23:34,270
Okay, he did.

2460
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:36,030
Wait, oh my god!

2461
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:41,690
Okay, yeah man, that was a really good prediction though.

2462
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:54,510
Oh my- okay, that prediction was crazy, yeah man.

2463
02:23:54,510 --> 02:23:57,750
That was an insane prediction I had there.

2464
02:23:59,650 --> 02:24:02,510
Are you serious?!

2465
02:24:11,490 --> 02:24:13,430
Guys, I don't know, guys.

2466
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:20,010
Guys, I don't know anymore.

2467
02:24:21,690 --> 02:24:24,450
Guys, I don't know anymore, guys!

2468
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:29,750
Guys, I don't know anymore.

2469
02:24:30,650 --> 02:24:32,710
This horse is so buff!

2470
02:24:36,590 --> 02:24:38,950
Guys, I don't know anymore.

2471
02:24:40,010 --> 02:24:42,530
This horse is so fucking strong!

2472
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:47,010
Why?!

2473
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:54,430
This horse is so strong, guys!

2474
02:24:57,970 --> 02:25:01,330
I don't know!

2475
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:04,550
I'm so scared!

2476
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:04,630
I'm so scared!

2477
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:19,790
Oh my god, I perfectly- Oh my- what the- Okay, okay, I have- Where is he?

2478
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:23,070
Please get over here.

2479
02:25:24,570 --> 02:25:25,910
Please get over here.

2480
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:36,170
Please, let me breakdance on you really fast!

2481
02:25:40,410 --> 02:25:41,750
Oh man, I broke his shit.

2482
02:25:42,170 --> 02:25:42,730
I can stun him.

2483
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:45,150
Oh my god, I'm halfway through.

2484
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:46,730
Goodbye.

2485
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:50,570
I leave, I leave, I leave, I leave, I need to get bread.

2486
02:25:50,930 --> 02:25:51,490
I leave.

2487
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:52,510
I leave.

2488
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:53,310
Goodbye.

2489
02:25:54,130 --> 02:25:54,970
It's bread time.

2490
02:25:56,410 --> 02:25:57,650
It's bread time.

2491
02:25:58,710 --> 02:25:59,890
I leave, I leave.

2492
02:26:01,910 --> 02:26:02,750
Bread time!

2493
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:08,410
Oh my god.

2494
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:10,190
Oh my god, let's go back.

2495
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:13,030
His phase 2 is so hard!

2496
02:26:15,230 --> 02:26:17,590
Oh my god, I'm coming back!

2497
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:18,810
Oh my god!

2498
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:25,770
Okay.

2499
02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:28,570
What?!

2500
02:26:28,570 --> 02:26:30,090
I just got here!

2501
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:46,500
I'm so fucked up!

2502
02:26:48,020 --> 02:26:50,780
I only just got here!

2503
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:05,960
Jesus, don't- Get out of here!

2504
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:07,240
Get out of here!

2505
02:27:08,660 --> 02:27:09,700
No!

2506
02:27:10,220 --> 02:27:11,060
No!

2507
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:12,760
No!

2508
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:16,500
Bro!

2509
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:23,570
I'm so sad.

2510
02:27:24,150 --> 02:27:26,070
I'm so sad!

2511
02:27:30,270 --> 02:27:34,550
Oh my god, why is he so strong?!

2512
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:40,610
Oh my god, that was my best run.

2513
02:27:41,010 --> 02:27:43,430
That was my best run so far.

2514
02:27:43,770 --> 02:27:45,730
Oh fuck, I fucked up.

You have to do perfect evades, that's so hard!

02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:37,270
Oh, I got the bread.

2573
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:38,970

What is this?!

2583
02:32:20,110 --> 02:32:21,230

Oh, I parried, I parried for the first time!

02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:09,630
No, and then I stopped parrying!

2596
02:33:10,670 --> 02:33:11,830
Oh my god, is there any more bread?

2597
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:14,610
Guys, guys, we're gonna run for bread!

2598
02:33:15,630 --> 02:33:17,170

02:33:51,210 --> 02:33:51,790
It's Lu Bu.

2614
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:53,830
You'd understand.

2615
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:55,250
It's literally Lu Bu.

Wait, when are you being a gun?

2625
02:34:28,990 --> 02:34:29,510
Checkpoint!

2626
02:34:30,030 --> 02:34:30,490
Wait!

2627
02:34:36,390 --> 02:34:37,230
Guys, I got a checkpoint!

2628
02:34:37,770 --> 02:34:39,510
Oh my god, I got a checkpoint!

2629
02:34:40,470 --> 02:34:41,950
There's actually a gun!

2630
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:44,850
This is so doable!

2631
02:34:48,210 --> 02:34:49,370
Oh, fuck!

2632
02:34:49,650 --> 02:34:50,170
Nevermind.

2633
02:34:50,930 --> 02:34:52,970
Nevermind, he decided to bring a gun.

2634
02:34:55,010 --> 02:34:56,050
Wait, unless...

2635
02:34:59,410 --> 02:35:00,010
Okay.

2636
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:01,530

02:35:03,630 --> 02:35:04,810
Oh, I missed.

02:35:05,130 --> 02:35:05,870
That's cool.

2639
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:08,850
Okay.

2640
02:35:10,010 --> 02:35:10,890
Oh, I countered.

2641
02:35:11,210 --> 02:35:12,470
Oh my god, I countered.

2642
02:35:12,750 --> 02:35:16,670
Oh my god, what world am I living in where I actually countered?

2643
02:35:16,710 --> 02:35:20,430
Oh my god, I died.

2644
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:20,470
I died.

2645
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:30,860
Oh my god, he's so low!

2646
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:32,840
He's right there!

2647
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:37,020
Perfect!

2648
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:38,100
Perfect invade!

2649
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:41,200
Oh my god!

2650
02:35:41,720 --> 02:35:42,140
No!

2651
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:45,040
Oh, fuck!

2652
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,000
Okay.

2653
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:50,400
It's fine.

2654
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:52,640
Just kill Xiaodong, I don't care.

2655
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:55,260
You can kill him!

2656
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:56,700
I just need to live.

2657
02:35:58,300 --> 02:35:59,620
Oh, my heart.

2658
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:01,820
Oh, perfect!

2659
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:07,980
Okay, that was a little overkill.

2660
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:11,000
That was... Guys, I can't get bread!

2661
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:12,740
I've used up all the bread!

2662
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:19,500
I've actually used up all my bread resources!

2663
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:26,340
Oh, I have to avoid that?

2664
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:26,900
Okay.

2665
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:28,940
Okay.

2666
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:31,340
Okay!

2667
02:36:34,300 --> 02:36:35,680
Oh, thank god!

2668
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,960
Xiaodong focused defenses!

2669
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:39,560
I'm 1 HP!

2670
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:48,040
I'm 1 HP!

2671
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:50,020

Got it!

2674
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:02,580
Oh, fuck!

2675
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:03,240
No!

2676
02:37:07,430 --> 02:37:07,930
No!

2677
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:14,790
Wait!

2678
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:19,780
No!

2679
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:43,070
It was so good!

2680
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:45,590
It was so good!

2681
02:37:46,170 --> 02:37:47,990
I just...

2682
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:57,840
Oh my god, it was so good!

2683
02:37:58,260 --> 02:38:00,860
I got so many dodges!

2684
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:06,620
Oh my god, I did so many perfect MPs!

2685
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:10,060
It was so cool!

2686
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:13,640
It was so fucking cool!

2687
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:18,480
No!

2688
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:23,520
It was so cool!

2689
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:26,880
I did such... Oh my god!

2690
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:32,620
The perfect MPs and everything!

2691
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:36,020
Oh my god!

2692

I actually landed every dodge possible!

2693
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:44,200
And I still fumbled it!

2694
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:46,600
I still fumbled it!

2695
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:51,040
I landed every fucking dodge imaginable!

2696
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:56,820
Okay.

2697
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:04,320
Oh my... Guys, I know it's cheesy that I am...

2698
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:08,520
That, like, we're doing checkpoints, but you don't understand.

2699
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:10,360
I'm a broken man now.

2700
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:11,800
I'm so broken.

2701
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:16,420
I can't... I cannot do... I cannot, like, 100-0 Lu Bu.

2702
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:18,040
You don't understand.

2703
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,080
I've been through so much.

2704
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:22,260
You did Lu Bu.

2705
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:24,240
You don't understand.

2706
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:30,220
He's... He's... He's a fucking monster!

2707
02:39:30,980 --> 02:39:34,200
He is the hardest man you will ever fight.

2708
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:40,260
Holy fuck.

2709
02:39:41,860 --> 02:39:43,200
Oh my god!

2710
02:39:49,130 --> 02:39:50,650
Holy shit.

2711
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:52,970
Okay.

2712
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:54,730
I'm sorry, Toki!

2713
02:39:55,110 --> 02:39:55,810
I'm sorry!

2714
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:58,110
I'm fighting Lu Bu right now!

2715
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:59,110
I'm sorry!

2716
02:40:01,930 --> 02:40:03,590
I'm sorry!

2717
02:40:05,470 --> 02:40:08,670
I have to fight Lu Bu!

2718
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:13,950
No!

2719
02:40:15,230 --> 02:40:15,590
No!

2720
02:40:20,410 --> 02:40:21,190
I'm locking in.

2721
02:40:21,270 --> 02:40:22,470
I have to lock... I'm locking in.

2722
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:22,890
I'm locking in.

2723
02:40:22,970 --> 02:40:23,390
I'm locking in.

2724
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:23,830
I'm locking in.

2725
02:40:23,950 --> 02:40:24,290
I'm locking in.

2726
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:24,830
I'm locking in.

2727
02:40:25,550 --> 02:40:26,350
Okay, kill him.

2728
02:40:26,470 --> 02:40:26,750
Kill him.

2729
02:40:26,750 --> 02:40:27,130
Not me.

2730
02:40:27,310 --> 02:40:27,710
Kill him.

2731
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:29,430
Alright, there you go.

2732
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:29,950
My turn.

2733
02:40:30,890 --> 02:40:32,030
Okay, I guess not.

2734
02:40:32,150 --> 02:40:33,130
My turn for real, though.

2735
02:40:34,050 --> 02:40:34,670
For real.

2736
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:36,790
Okay.

2737
02:40:37,810 --> 02:40:39,230
Oh my god!

2738
02:40:39,390 --> 02:40:40,870
I won it again!

2739
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:44,770
Oh my...

2740
02:40:46,090 --> 02:40:47,670
Okay, actually locked in.

2741
02:40:48,170 --> 02:40:49,930
I'm actually locked in for real.

2742
02:40:52,310 --> 02:40:53,490
Okay, kill him.

2743
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:54,830
That's fine.

2744
02:40:58,910 --> 02:40:59,170
Oh god.

2745
02:41:01,550 --> 02:41:02,130
What?

2746
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:03,870
How do I... Oh my god.

2747
02:41:06,170 --> 02:41:08,530
Are you serious?!

2748
02:41:09,090 --> 02:41:10,090
Okay, that is bullshit.

2749
02:41:11,030 --> 02:41:13,370
Like, I should be able to counter that!

2750
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:16,690
Why can't I fucking invade that?

2751
02:41:23,290 --> 02:41:24,890
Come on!

2752
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:30,750
Okay, I'm just gonna dodge further away.

2753
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:32,350
Nice!

2754
02:41:36,130 --> 02:41:36,930
What?!

2755
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:41,240
I don't know.

2756
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:44,340
I can't get past his first attack anymore.

2757
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:48,600
Okay.

2758
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:51,760
Okay.

2759
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:52,740
Nice!

2760
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:55,880
Alright.

2761
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:57,160
We can do this.

2762
02:42:00,520 --> 02:42:01,800
Oh my god!

2763
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:04,160
Nice.

2764
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:08,620
Okay.

2765
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:13,300
Okay.

2766
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:14,280
I'm degrading!

2767
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:16,100
I'm degrading!

2768
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:18,060
I'm getting worse!

2769
02:42:18,380 --> 02:42:20,960
How am I getting worse?!

2770
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:24,440
How am I getting worse?!

2771
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:26,760
Okay.

2772
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,880
Okay, no part.

2773
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:29,320
Focus.

2774
02:42:33,790 --> 02:42:34,350
Guys.

2775
02:42:39,250 --> 02:42:39,810
Okay.

2776
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:42,910
I'm losing focus.

2777
02:42:43,150 --> 02:42:44,310
I'm losing focus.

2778
02:42:44,730 --> 02:42:45,830
Okay, calm down.

2779
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:46,810
Calm down, Doki.

2780
02:42:46,870 --> 02:42:47,490
You got this.

2781
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:49,670
You got this.

2782
02:43:01,810 --> 02:43:04,030
I don't have arrows, guys.

2783
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:06,250
Guys, I don't have arrows.

2784
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:07,490
I have it on cooldown.

2785
02:43:08,170 --> 02:43:09,030
Wait, do I actually?

2786
02:43:09,890 --> 02:43:10,770
I can't, guys.

2787
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:11,670
I can't arrow.

2788
02:43:12,510 --> 02:43:13,390
It's on cooldown.

2789
02:43:14,810 --> 02:43:16,510
Oh my god!

2790
02:43:17,670 --> 02:43:20,030
What happened to me?!

2791
02:43:21,870 --> 02:43:22,450
Okay, stop.

2792
02:43:22,730 --> 02:43:23,330
Stop mauling.

2793
02:43:23,490 --> 02:43:24,090
Stop mauling.

2794
02:43:24,170 --> 02:43:26,470
You're only losing because you're getting mad now.

2795
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:29,010
You're only losing because you're angry.

2796
02:43:29,390 --> 02:43:30,670
Which is understandable.

2797
02:43:30,910 --> 02:43:31,550
He's noobu.

2798
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:35,930
This can't be.

2799
02:43:41,430 --> 02:43:41,550
Okay.

2800
02:43:41,970 --> 02:43:42,930
Okay.

2801
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:43,590
Okay.

2802
02:43:44,650 --> 02:43:46,450
Okay, we got this.

2803
02:43:46,850 --> 02:43:47,510
Don't maul.

2804
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:49,470
Don't maul.

2805
02:43:52,590 --> 02:43:56,590
And then we... dodge!

2806
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:01,010
Okay.

2807
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:02,070
Focus.

2808
02:44:02,530 --> 02:44:03,050
Be patient.

2809
02:44:03,250 --> 02:44:03,770
Be patient.

2810
02:44:04,110 --> 02:44:05,170
Be patient, Doki.

2811
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:06,330
Alright.

2812
02:44:09,770 --> 02:44:12,590
Are you serious?!

2813
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:28,070
I've got no choice but to fall back.

2814
02:44:31,510 --> 02:44:32,250
Concentrate.

2815
02:44:36,450 --> 02:44:39,710
I can't die in a place like this.

2816
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:49,350
I'll allow others to take the glory today.

2817
02:44:57,170 --> 02:44:58,570
Okay.

2818
02:45:05,390 --> 02:45:10,410
Oh my god!

2819
02:45:10,870 --> 02:45:12,690
Oh my god!

2820
02:45:13,710 --> 02:45:20,260
I did it!

2821
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:29,360
I did it!

2822
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:29,400
I did it!

2823
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,640
Let's go.

2824
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:34,180
Oh my god.

2825
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:39,220
Oh my god, we did it!

2826
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,840
We fucking did it.

2827
02:45:43,660 --> 02:45:47,860
Oh, my voice is gone, but we killed littlebu.

2828
02:45:52,060 --> 02:45:55,280
We did it.

2829
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:59,840
We pursued littlebu.

2830
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:03,400
We fucking did it.

2831
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:06,100
We fucking pursued littlebu.

2832
02:46:06,660 --> 02:46:08,300
I'm so happy.

2833
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,780
I'm so happy.

2834
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:13,840
I'm so happy.

2835
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:16,880
Everybody is dead.

2836
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:21,020
Everyone is dead, but we did it.

2837
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:23,300
We did it.

2838
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:25,520
I'm sorry.

2839
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:31,060
They're all dead, but we did it, though.

2840
02:46:32,760 --> 02:46:37,820
They're all dead, but we did it.

2841
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,440
I don't care.

2842
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:44,600
I don't care.

2843
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:46,120
I don't care.

2844
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:50,080
Oh my god.

2845
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:53,020
I'm so happy.

2846
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:56,560
Oh my god.

2847
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,220
I don't care.

2848
02:46:58,820 --> 02:47:02,800
I don't care if we used the checkpoint.

2849
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:08,060
It would have been impossible to kill him.

2850
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:12,900
Guys, you don't understand.

2851
02:47:12,900 --> 02:47:19,240
I would be here forever if I didn't use checkpoint.

2852
02:47:19,380 --> 02:47:23,160
Guys, you don't understand.

2853
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:30,400
I wouldn't have, we would have not ended stream for a long time.

2854
02:47:32,380 --> 02:47:34,380
I'm just so happy.

2855
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:36,200
I'm so happy.

2856
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:38,340
I'm so happy.

2857
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:41,740
Oh my god.

2858
02:47:41,740 --> 02:47:44,580
We pursued Lu Bu.

2859
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:49,620
Everyone is dead, but we did it.

2860
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:52,580
They're all dead.

2861
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:56,560
All our friends are dead.

2862
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:02,320
But it's okay.

2863
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:05,080
Lu Bu is dead.

2864
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:07,600
He's dead.

2865
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:09,460
Oh my god.

2866
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:13,360
Oh, I'm so happy.

2867
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:18,940
It's okay, me and Lu Bu, we can solo this.

2868
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:24,620
We can solo this, me and Lu Bu.

2869
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:29,740
It's alright, alright Lu Bu, just you and I.

2870
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:32,120
Let's go.

2871
02:48:35,460 --> 02:48:36,800
We did it.

2872
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:41,920
We fucking did it.

2873
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:43,240
I'm so happy.

2874
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,600
We fucking did it.

2875
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:47,100
Oh, fuck.

2876
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:51,720
Wait, what do I do against the catapults?

2877
02:48:53,360 --> 02:48:55,080
What the fuck?

2878
02:48:55,480 --> 02:48:56,560
What do I do here?

2879
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:00,720
Okay.

2880
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:05,140
Okay, guys, please.

2881
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:07,440
Please get out.

2882
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:12,180
I'm so... I'm just...

2883
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:15,720
Oh my god, I don't care if I die here.

2884
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:22,860
Soldiers are strong, but you can bring down it by striking them from behind?

2885
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:25,140
How do I...

2886
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:30,280
How?

2887
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:33,400
This way!

2888
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:36,600
Wait, how?

2889
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:41,760
Oh my god!

2890
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:44,360
Is this how I'm gonna die?

2891
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:46,200
Oh my...

2892
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:47,960
Guys, this is how I'm gonna die.

2893
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:49,060
I guess.

2894
02:49:49,400 --> 02:49:51,220
I guess this is how I'm gonna...

2895
02:49:51,220 --> 02:49:52,380
How do I... What?

2896
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:59,570
How do I pass through them?

2897
02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:04,770
Wait, there's...

2898
02:50:05,110 --> 02:50:05,910
There's buttons here.

2899
02:50:07,090 --> 02:50:07,770
Nice.

2900
02:50:11,250 --> 02:50:11,830
Okay.

2901
02:50:12,610 --> 02:50:14,230
I'm gonna figure this out.

2902
02:50:17,450 --> 02:50:17,670
Okay.

2903
02:50:23,050 --> 02:50:23,870
It's fine.

2904
02:50:24,310 --> 02:50:25,430
I'm just gonna do this.

2905
02:50:28,550 --> 02:50:29,110
That's fine.

2906
02:50:32,310 --> 02:50:35,130
I'm just gonna... Fuck yeah, I'm just gonna run straight at it.

2907
02:50:36,210 --> 02:50:37,390
I'm fine with that.

2908
02:50:39,550 --> 02:50:41,630
Wait, I can just jump... Guys, you liars.

2909
02:50:44,090 --> 02:50:46,290
Guys, I can't just jump through it.

2910
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:47,290
Guys, you liars.

2911
02:50:47,490 --> 02:50:48,810
Guys, I have an idea.

2912
02:50:50,030 --> 02:50:51,650
The only way.

2913
02:50:55,950 --> 02:50:58,990
I shall shout, who turned my way out of here.

2914
02:51:07,390 --> 02:51:10,030
I shall shout, who turned my way...

2915
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:16,390
Nothing beats shout, who turned...

2916
02:51:19,510 --> 02:51:23,390
I shall shout, who turned my way out...

2917
02:51:25,230 --> 02:51:27,170
That's fucking right.

2918
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:33,010
How do I destroy it though?

2919
02:51:33,010 --> 02:51:33,170
Oh.

2920
02:51:35,850 --> 02:51:37,510
Wait, a fire attack?

2921
02:51:39,410 --> 02:51:42,410
Oh shit, wait, I was supposed to...

2922
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:44,970
That's fine.

2923
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:49,070
Wait, I wasn't supposed to do that.

2924
02:51:49,130 --> 02:51:49,510
Oh well.

2925
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:53,610
Oh, I need allies.

2926
02:51:54,010 --> 02:51:54,430
Whoops.

2927
02:51:56,170 --> 02:51:58,950
I just realized this is not how you're supposed to win this.

2928
02:52:01,390 --> 02:52:04,010
Okay, I forgot about my allies, guys.

2929
02:52:07,310 --> 02:52:08,310
It's fine.

2930
02:52:08,930 --> 02:52:10,210
I created an opening.

2931
02:52:12,050 --> 02:52:14,170
But I have an opening though.

2932
02:52:18,070 --> 02:52:21,770
But look at this cool ass opening I made.

2933
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:23,390
For my team.

2934
02:52:24,090 --> 02:52:26,250
Okay, let's like, help them.

2935
02:52:27,230 --> 02:52:29,670
Um, okay, this is awkward.

2936
02:52:29,870 --> 02:52:30,440
How do I...

2937
02:52:31,130 --> 02:52:32,550
Okay, we gotta figure this out.

2938
02:52:32,650 --> 02:52:34,750
My openings are really tiny.

2939
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:36,250
This is...

2940
02:52:37,050 --> 02:52:39,450
Look at that tiny opening I made though!

2941
02:52:40,470 --> 02:52:41,050
Look at that!

2942
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:44,590
Look at that!

2943
02:52:44,730 --> 02:52:45,710
Look at the opening!

2944
02:52:48,990 --> 02:52:52,710
Alright guys, I don't think we're defeating the caterpillar anytime soon.

2945
02:52:59,060 --> 02:53:02,060
Oh my god, what do you mean, Dragoon?!

2946
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:08,460
What do you... Oh my god, my Dragoons don't believe in me.

2947
02:53:08,860 --> 02:53:10,040
I don't understand.

2948
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,060
Dragoons, why don't you believe?!

2949
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:25,320
Sorry, we got hit by the caterpillar.

2950
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:28,540
I'm doing my best!

2951
02:53:28,540 --> 02:53:28,700
I'm doing my best!

2952
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:34,220
Fuck this.

2953
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,780
Fuck this one guy!

2954
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:43,840
Nice!

2955
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:44,860
Go Lupe!

2956
02:53:49,640 --> 02:53:50,620
Where is he?

2957
02:53:51,860 --> 02:53:52,680
Oh, there he is.

2958
02:53:55,290 --> 02:53:56,340
Nice, I broke his neck!

2959
02:53:59,260 --> 02:54:00,880
Guys, come on!

2960
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:05,740
We just need to break two caterpillars, guys!

2961
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:10,360
I created an opening!

2962
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:16,540
What else do you want me to do?!

2963
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:24,780
Okay, I gotta kill him first before I do anything.

2964
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:29,300
Nice.

2965
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:31,580
Alright.

2966
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:32,960
Guys, guys, come on!

2967
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Let's kill this caterpillar!

2968
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:34,780
Come on!

2969
02:54:36,220 --> 02:54:36,960
We did it!

2970
02:54:40,260 --> 02:54:41,740
Guys, we're doing it!

2971
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:44,580
I do not have enough allies.

2972
02:54:44,860 --> 02:54:46,960
I don't have enough allies!

2973
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:49,560
Guys, we got this!

2974
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:51,400
The last caterpillar!

2975
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:52,140
Please!

2976
02:54:54,800 --> 02:54:55,920
Please, guys!

2977
02:54:57,220 --> 02:54:58,420
We can do this!

2978
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:00,380
We can do this in 44 seconds!

2979
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:03,000
It's just the four brothers.

2980
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:06,200
Guys, we can do this!

2981
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:08,760
Look at the underhull I made!

2982
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:11,700
We did it!

2983
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:15,080
I understood the assignments, guys.

2984
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:17,180
I definitely understood.

2985
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:23,400
It's just me and Shu.

2986
02:55:29,060 --> 02:55:34,180
It is a little awkward that it's just me and Shu because I let everybody else die for Lu Bu.

2987
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:35,960
But you don't understand.

2988
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:36,980
It was very important.

2989
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:41,020
You guys don't understand.

2990
02:55:46,360 --> 02:55:47,060
Wait, again?

2991
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:51,700
Oh my god.

2992
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:54,200
Okay, where's my other opening?

2993
02:55:54,560 --> 02:55:56,520
Wait, there it is.

2994
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:00,340
I was like, where's the other opening that I made?

2995
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:01,960
It's okay, we did it.

2996
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:05,240
I knew that would be important.

2997
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:11,180
Guys, I knew that would have been important.

2998
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:11,920
There it is.

2999
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:15,520
Zhang Fei, please.

3000
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:16,860
Zhang Fei, please.

3001
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:19,180
Wait, what?

3002
02:56:21,960 --> 02:56:23,440
Wait, Dao Chen!

3003
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:24,640
What happened?

3004
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:27,820
Oh no.

3005
02:56:28,240 --> 02:56:30,340
Please, I have to do this first.

3006
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:34,220
I have to kill him.

3007
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:40,560
No way, you mean the girl that ends up marrying Lu Bu and...

3008
02:56:42,380 --> 02:56:46,260
Lu Bu and... Oh my god, Dao Chen.

3009
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:47,280
Okay, who dueled me?

3010
02:56:47,620 --> 02:56:49,440
You're dueling me, you bitch.

3011
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:54,520
You bitch.

3012
02:56:58,860 --> 02:56:59,860
That's right.

3013
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:02,140
You think you're gonna win this 1v1?

3014
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:04,440
You think you're gonna win this?

3015
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:07,440
That's fucking right.

3016
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:09,960
That's right.

3017
02:57:10,760 --> 02:57:12,340
You're not gonna win shit.

3018
02:57:13,600 --> 02:57:15,240
Get out of here.

3019
02:57:15,440 --> 02:57:16,820
Get out.

3020
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:20,200
Okay, where is he?

3021
02:57:20,660 --> 02:57:22,320
Alright, back to the real fight.

3022
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:27,580
Get out.

3023
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:30,120
Get out of here.

3024
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:32,260
Fucking challenging me.

3025
02:57:33,080 --> 02:57:35,040
Get out of here.

3026
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:40,000
Can't believe you think you're gonna win this fight.

3027
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:42,780
That's embarrassing.

3028
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:48,120
That's so... Eat your puns.

3029
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:53,080
Guys, I feel like I might crash when I hit a thousandth kill.

3030
02:57:55,960 --> 02:58:03,920
Guys, if my PC crashes the moment we hit a thousand kills, I'm ending stream.

3031
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:10,420
We're getting there, guys.

3032
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:12,140
And I'm afraid.

3033
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:18,660
I am very afraid.

3034
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:20,740
We are a hundred away.

3035
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:24,560
I'm calling it.

3036
02:58:25,180 --> 02:58:28,360
I can't have nice things.

3037
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:31,080
I'm fucking calling it.

3038
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:37,180
And then we have to fight him again.

3039
02:58:38,380 --> 02:58:40,800
Okay, do I get to save my game?

3040
02:58:41,660 --> 02:58:42,460
Is there a save?

3041
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:43,680
There's no saves.

3042
02:58:44,120 --> 02:58:46,420
You can't save in the battle.

3043
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:52,520
It's getting there.

3044
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,720
Natalie took everything from me.

3045
02:59:00,380 --> 02:59:02,640
Okay, let's get Li Ming out of here too.

3046
02:59:06,820 --> 02:59:07,520
Do I not?

3047
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:08,120
Okay, I do.

3048
02:59:11,260 --> 02:59:11,580
Okay.

3049
02:59:13,860 --> 02:59:15,480
Okay, I knew there was gonna be arrows.

3050
02:59:16,540 --> 02:59:17,000
Nice.

3051
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:18,640
I broke his shield.

3052
02:59:21,380 --> 02:59:22,840
There's always an opening.

3053
02:59:24,320 --> 02:59:26,200
Fifty more to go.

3054
02:59:27,780 --> 02:59:28,900
Fifty more.

3055
02:59:32,560 --> 02:59:34,480
Oh my god, I almost forgot to eat that bun.

3056
02:59:37,540 --> 02:59:38,060
Okay.

3057
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:43,280
Jesus, Chris, I did not mean to call my horse.

3058
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:48,960
Why are you so strong?

3059
02:59:49,140 --> 02:59:53,180
You are no... I literally killed Dil Chen in like 30 seconds.

3060
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:56,620
You should not be that strong.

3061
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,560
Get out.

3062
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:03,260
Wait, bro, he's 1 HP.

3063
03:00:03,780 --> 03:00:06,540
You are not kill-stealing that from me.

3064
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:09,220
Oh my god.

3065
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:12,200
Guys, I'm scared.

3066
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,440
Guys.

3067
03:00:15,080 --> 03:00:17,040
Mr. Boi!

3068
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,920
Oh no!

3069
03:00:23,080 --> 03:00:25,480
No, he's so far!

3070
03:00:29,240 --> 03:00:32,420
Jesus Christ, 90!

3071
03:00:34,900 --> 03:00:36,860
A thousand.

3072
03:00:36,860 --> 03:00:37,140
A thousand.

3073
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:42,620
I am a true warrior.

3074
03:00:44,060 --> 03:00:46,040
I am a true warrior!

3075
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:49,860
Am I still a true warrior?

3076
03:00:50,340 --> 03:00:52,060
I am still a true warrior!

3077
03:00:53,440 --> 03:00:54,700
We live!

3078
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:56,960
We live!

3079
03:01:01,440 --> 03:01:02,540
We're living!

3080
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:03,420
We're living!

3081
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,760
You know what?

3082
03:01:05,900 --> 03:01:06,400
Fuck this.

3083
03:01:06,640 --> 03:01:07,840
Oh, I don't have enough allies.

3084
03:01:08,640 --> 03:01:10,540
Oh my god, we actually lived.

3085
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:11,940
Oh my god.

3086
03:01:12,120 --> 03:01:13,300
Oh my god.

3087
03:01:13,540 --> 03:01:16,420
I don't... I forgot what that was like.

3088
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:19,860
Also, I'm fucking 2v1-ing right now.

3089
03:01:20,340 --> 03:01:22,040
This is so not fair.

3090
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:24,100
Bro, okay.

3091
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:25,760
Okay, I don't have any more bread.

3092
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:26,300
I'm leaving.

3093
03:01:26,300 --> 03:01:26,340
I'm leaving.

3094
03:01:29,700 --> 03:01:31,400
Wait, are there any bread?

3095
03:01:31,500 --> 03:01:34,140
Okay, guys, I have to get the bread right here.

3096
03:01:34,580 --> 03:01:35,720
Me and the shoe army.

3097
03:01:38,700 --> 03:01:43,000
It's literally just me and the shoe army in this fight.

3098
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:46,540
Okay.

3099
03:01:48,680 --> 03:01:49,720
Oh, fuck.

3100
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:51,620
Okay.

3101
03:01:52,320 --> 03:01:53,780
Go, go, go, go.

3102
03:01:54,440 --> 03:01:56,560
Xiaohu Dan is not okay right now.

3103
03:01:57,760 --> 03:01:59,320
Go, go, go, go.

3104
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:02,720
None of us are okay.

3105
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:08,960
Jesus Christ.

3106
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:13,200
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure Zhang Fei will be okay.

3107
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:14,980
Don't worry.

3108
03:02:17,260 --> 03:02:17,840
Alright.

3109
03:02:18,540 --> 03:02:19,600
Come on, run into my blades.

3110
03:02:21,660 --> 03:02:22,220
Nice.

3111
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:24,840
Alright.

3112
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:27,580
Zhang Fei will be okay.

3113
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:28,640
Zhang Fei will be okay.

3114
03:02:29,220 --> 03:02:31,260
He has enough bread to sustain himself.

3115
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,920
He has so much bread to sustain himself.

3116
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:40,940
I'm gonna save... I'm saving my... my musu for Dong Zhuo.

3117
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:43,820
Lupe, please.

3118
03:02:44,140 --> 03:02:45,900
Wait, does Lupe not have any more bread?

3119
03:02:48,100 --> 03:02:50,460
Oh no, Lupe doesn't have any more bread.

3120
03:02:50,780 --> 03:02:51,480
Lupe, no!

3121
03:02:55,580 --> 03:02:56,320
Okay.

3122
03:02:58,660 --> 03:03:00,460
This should be the last one.

3123
03:03:01,820 --> 03:03:04,760
He makes me wanna buy bread.

3124
03:03:07,740 --> 03:03:10,420
Oh my god, it's time!

3125
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:12,680
It's time!

3126
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:21,260
It's time to be angry!

3127
03:03:22,770 --> 03:03:23,620
I'm ready!

3128
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:27,760
I'm ready to be mad!

3129
03:03:31,940 --> 03:03:35,800
That's fucking right, I'll break that thing on you!

3130
03:03:38,510 --> 03:03:39,560
I'm coming over.

3131
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:41,380
I'm coming over.

3132
03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:44,060
Fucking coming over.

3133
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:46,240
Get out of here!

3134
03:03:53,780 --> 03:03:54,700
Fucking what?

3135
03:04:00,980 --> 03:04:02,120
Get in there, Lupe!

3136
03:04:05,020 --> 03:04:05,660
Nice.

3137
03:04:07,960 --> 03:04:08,860
That's right!

3138
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:10,100
It's unlocked!

3139
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:12,640
Lupe has trained me for this!

3140
03:04:14,860 --> 03:04:16,700
That's right, get countered!

3141
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:19,740
Lupe has not trained me for this, but still get countered.

3142
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:24,980
Lupe has not taught me how to counter.

3143
03:04:25,780 --> 03:04:26,380
Yes!

3144
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:28,220
I challenge you.

3145
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:30,660
That's fucking right.

3146
03:04:34,590 --> 03:04:35,590
That's right.

3147
03:04:36,910 --> 03:04:42,150
Oh, you thought... you thought just cause you're gonna do a 1v1?

3148
03:04:42,930 --> 03:04:43,510
Oh shit.

3149
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:48,290
That's fucking right.

3150
03:04:49,150 --> 03:04:50,350
You think I won?

3151
03:04:50,490 --> 03:04:51,650
You're gonna win a 1v1?

3152
03:04:51,710 --> 03:04:52,170
Oh shit.

3153
03:04:54,190 --> 03:04:54,590
Sorry.

3154
03:04:55,870 --> 03:04:56,930
Okay, I still got it.

3155
03:04:56,970 --> 03:04:57,690
I still got it.

3156
03:04:57,690 --> 03:04:58,330
Don't worry, guys.

3157
03:04:58,930 --> 03:05:01,510
Don't worry, I just wanted to make him feel...

3158
03:05:04,030 --> 03:05:05,230
Guys, guys, don't worry.

3159
03:05:05,330 --> 03:05:06,010
I still got it.

3160
03:05:06,030 --> 03:05:06,710
I still got it.

3161
03:05:06,730 --> 03:05:07,310
I still got it.

3162
03:05:07,330 --> 03:05:07,670
Don't worry.

3163
03:05:07,930 --> 03:05:08,530
Don't worry.

3164
03:05:08,610 --> 03:05:09,050
Don't worry.

3165
03:05:09,390 --> 03:05:10,210
Don't worry.

3166
03:05:11,390 --> 03:05:13,430
Don't worry, everything is still fine.

3167
03:05:14,290 --> 03:05:18,150
Don't worry, everything is still fine.

3168
03:05:18,310 --> 03:05:21,170
I just wanted to make him feel a little special.

3169
03:05:21,530 --> 03:05:23,610
I got a little cocky.

3170
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:25,430
I got a little cocky.

3171
03:05:27,770 --> 03:05:29,590
The fucking guy.

3172
03:05:30,670 --> 03:05:32,750
Oh my god.

3173
03:05:33,630 --> 03:05:34,730
We did it.

3174
03:05:35,290 --> 03:05:37,010
We fucking did it.

3175
03:05:37,650 --> 03:05:39,070
Oh my god.

3176
03:05:39,270 --> 03:05:41,010
That was the hardest.

3177
03:05:41,890 --> 03:05:43,150
That was the hardest.

3178
03:05:43,310 --> 03:05:44,790
Holy fuck.

3179
03:05:50,990 --> 03:05:53,110
Oh my god.

3180
03:05:56,270 --> 03:05:58,770
Bro, there's no way I don't get his health.

3181
03:05:58,970 --> 03:06:00,050
Oh my god.

3182
03:06:01,890 --> 03:06:04,570
That was definitely the hardest.

3183
03:06:04,810 --> 03:06:05,850
Oh my god.

3184
03:06:05,910 --> 03:06:07,690
I leveled up so much.

3185
03:06:09,970 --> 03:06:11,070
Level 11.

3186
03:06:13,930 --> 03:06:18,790
I think I spent an hour on that fucking fight alone.

3187
03:06:19,410 --> 03:06:21,530
Oh my god.

3188
03:06:22,930 --> 03:06:27,050
Oh my god, I earned so much because of it.

3189
03:06:29,070 --> 03:06:31,750
Holy shit, look at everything I completed.

3190
03:06:34,030 --> 03:06:35,270
I should have enough.

3191
03:06:35,390 --> 03:06:37,370
I have 179.

3192
03:06:38,910 --> 03:06:39,630
Jesus.

3193
03:06:39,890 --> 03:06:40,810
Okay, we need attack.

3194
03:06:41,810 --> 03:06:43,470
We need defense.

3195
03:06:43,610 --> 03:06:45,130
We need health.

3196
03:06:50,550 --> 03:06:55,610
That was actually... I had to solo a fucking war.

3197
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:58,910
I let everybody die.

3198
03:06:58,910 --> 03:06:58,950
Okay.

3199
03:07:04,170 --> 03:07:11,930
That had to be... had to be the hardest fight of my fucking life.

3200
03:07:13,430 --> 03:07:14,550
And I'm gonna call it there.

3201
03:07:17,950 --> 03:07:20,110
Oh my god.

3202
03:07:22,510 --> 03:07:26,910
I felt like I was clawing my way to victory.

3203
03:07:27,910 --> 03:07:30,470
Guys, I have no voice anymore.

3204
03:07:30,730 --> 03:07:33,410
I have no voice anymore.

3205
03:07:37,130 --> 03:07:39,970
Lupo took everything from me.

3206
03:07:40,550 --> 03:07:41,950
He took everything.

3207
03:07:42,890 --> 03:07:44,530
I can't talk anymore.

3208
03:07:48,470 --> 03:07:53,670
Guys, I know I used checkpoints, but you don't understand.

3209
03:07:53,670 --> 03:08:03,330
If I didn't use checkpoints, that fight would single-handedly take me nine hours.

3210
03:08:03,890 --> 03:08:04,810
I could feel it.

3211
03:08:05,050 --> 03:08:11,570
I could feel that fight taking me nine hours to beat for Lupo alone.

3212
03:08:11,770 --> 03:08:13,710
I'm sorry, I'll feed you.

3213
03:08:14,090 --> 03:08:15,690
I had to fight Lupo.

3214
03:08:15,770 --> 03:08:17,910
You don't understand, Toki.

3215
03:08:18,730 --> 03:08:19,890
I had to fight.

3216
03:08:20,210 --> 03:08:21,850
Like, I don't... I'm hungry.

3217
03:08:26,450 --> 03:08:29,350
Oh, I gotta call it here.

3218
03:08:29,550 --> 03:08:30,030
He hungry.

3219
03:08:30,670 --> 03:08:32,930
But thank you everybody for coming.

3220
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:35,990
I pursued Lupo.

3221
03:08:42,210 --> 03:08:45,890
Everybody, thank you all for watching me pursue Lupo.

3222
03:08:46,310 --> 03:08:47,590
It was quite a journey.

3223
03:08:48,690 --> 03:08:51,310
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

3224
03:08:51,810 --> 03:08:52,490
Posture check.

3225
03:08:52,910 --> 03:08:53,870
Get up and move around.

3226
03:08:53,930 --> 03:08:54,990
Get that blood flowing.

3227
03:08:56,530 --> 03:09:00,610
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

3228
03:09:01,370 --> 03:09:02,890
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3229
03:09:03,590 --> 03:09:04,450
Bye, guys.

3230
03:09:04,650 --> 03:09:05,050
Bye!
