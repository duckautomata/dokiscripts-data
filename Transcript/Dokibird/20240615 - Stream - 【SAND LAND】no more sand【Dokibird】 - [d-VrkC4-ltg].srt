00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,620
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,340
Oh my god!

3
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,980
Okay, we're gonna have to restart the game already.

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,020
We're off to a good start.

5
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,860
Okay, give me a second.

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,300
I gotta restart the game.

7
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,400
I was like, oh wait, this is not...

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
Okay, alright.

9
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,800
Let me restart this real fast.

10
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,760
Let me restart this.

11
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,320
Oh my god!

12
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
Oh my god!

13
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,300
Okay, you're not seeing the problem I'm experiencing right now.

14
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,220
But it's a little bit of a problem.

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,940
And what it is... Okay, I might have to do this to...

16
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,480
Oh god.

17
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,920
Oh god.

18
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,060
Okay, give me a sec.

19
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Okay.

20
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,260
Plug in my controller!

21
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,560
Why is my controller not responding?

22
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,140
I'm a mess.

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,940
Okay.

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,380
Hello, controller?

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,440
Okay.

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,120
Okay guys, give me a sec.

27
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,060
Oh god, you don't see what I'm seeing, but it's so bad.

28
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm happy you're not seeing what I'm seeing right now.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,100
But basically, what's going on...

30
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,860
Is that... Okay, did this fix it?

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,880
Oh, I think it fixed it.

32
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,400
Okay, so what I was seeing was that...

33
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,140
It's like, there was flickering going on.

34
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,740
But like, it's not the flickering that you guys are using.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,100
It's the seeing.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,260
It's the flickering where...

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,980
Basically, I see myself flicker on the screen.

38
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,860
Like, my skin suit.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,460
I see my skin suit flickering on and off on the screen.

40
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,420
Because it's like... It's like trying to be like the dominant window.

41
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,440
So I have to be like, okay, I have to do full screen.

42
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,400
I can't.

43
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:33,900
I can't.

44
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,480
I was like, oh thank god.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,640
You're not... It was terrible.

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,500
It was actually so bad.

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,920
Why is it not controller?

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,260
Why is it...

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,240
Do I have to click continue to be on controller?

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,260
Guys, this is why...

51
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,040
This is what I mean when I said...

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,860
Like...

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,580
This is... Oh, wait.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,960
Here you go.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,680
Control setup.

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,740
Controller!

57
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,800
Why am I not on controller?

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,300
Hello?

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Why am I...

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Why am I...

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,440
PC, please.

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:10,720
Wait.

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,120
What's like... What's like the...

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,160
Uh...

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,000
The thing that boots up the Steam thingy?

66
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,260
PC, please.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,140
Why aren't you on controller?

68
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,120
Why aren't you...

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,200
Guys.

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,880
Guys.

71
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,620
We have a new PC, but I'm already a mess, guys.

72
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,780
I'm already on a mess.

73
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Normal size, fancy.

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
Thank you for the super chat.

75
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:34,820
Thank you.

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,460
Thank you.

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,100
Look on the bright side, Doki.

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,140
I don't know what it is, but look at it anyway.

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,660
Thank you for the super chat.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,040
Thank you.

81
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,680
Thank you.

82
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,680
This is... This is a new PC.

83
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,020
But like...

84
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,780
Everything is so new.

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,540
This is why change is so hard.

86
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,500
Oh, oh.

87
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,140
Wait.

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,660
Controller.

89
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, I have to restart it.

90
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,240
Okay.

91
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,900
We did it.

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,640
Guys.

93
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,900
See, guys?

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,420
I can... I can adapt.

95
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,860
That's when you know I'm a gamer.

96
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,580
Alright.

97
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,520
So...

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,240
Um...

99
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,720
I think sound guy... Sound guy, if you're here...

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,060
Let me know if everything sounds okay.

101
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,040
Uh... If everything sounds okay in chat, you don't have to type to me on Discord.

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,900
Because like...

103
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm too lazy to... to... you know...

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,700
Tab to my Discord.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,820
So anyway...

106
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,140
For those who forgot what happened last time...

107
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,440
What happened was that we found out that...

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,500
This lady right here should not be in our country.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,700
Because she was actually an illegal...

110
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,160
An illegal immigrant.

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,620
And she...

112
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,480
Uh...

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,160
Went to Sandland.

114
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,880
But she was actually from...

115
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
Forestland.

116
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,140
Look!

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,440
I...

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Look!

119
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,500
That's what they said!

120
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Okay?

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,200
They literally called her that!

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,200
So I'm just repeating what she said.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,760
Uh...

124
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm literally...

125
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm literally...

126
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm literally...

127
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm literally repeating like...

128
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,320
What she...

129
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,600
What they said about her.

130
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,860
So...

131
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Yeah, I was very surprised.

132
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:07,600
I was like...

133
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,060
I was honestly...

134
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
An illegal...

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,320
Yeah, I was very surprised they said that.

136
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,560
But like...

137
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,520
That's where the story is going...

138
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,700
Towards...

139
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,140
So...

140
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,020
She is actually from Forestland.

141
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,460
And...

142
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,320
Uh...

143
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,340
And...

144
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,960
Yeah...

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,620
And then...

146
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,240
What was crazy was...

147
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
Jeno was like...

148
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,220
Oh my god!

149
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,360
She shouldn't be here!

150
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
She should go back to Forestland!

151
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,140
I'm like...

152
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,680
What...

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,740
What am I playing?

154
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm just...

155
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm just like...

156
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,360
What...

157
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,980
What am I...

158
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,760
What am I playing?

159
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,680
And...

160
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,480
I thought...

161
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,000
Ugh...

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Wait...

163
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,160
What am I...

164
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,860
Uh...

165
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,380
I feel like...

166
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,120
Yeah...

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,160
The English...

168
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm glad I...

169
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm like...

170
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,840
I'm...

171
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm glad I played the English dub because I don't have to read.

172
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
But also...

173
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,520
What the fuck is going on with the English dub?

174
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,560
Like...

175
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,860
I'm like...

176
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,660
Also, Aquanium.

177
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,000
Also, Raul really loves Aquanium for some reason.

178
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,100
Or, thank you for the super chat.

179
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,960
Thank you, thank you.

180
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,100
Maybe the real scuf and the real controller was the friends we made all along the way.

181
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,380
Thank you for the super chat.

182
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,300
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,160
So yeah, that's the update.

184
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,460
That's literally like... honestly, that's literally it.

185
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,220
That's everything we need to know about this game so far.

186
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,420
Alright, we gotta go to here.

187
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,860
Let me see if I can remember how to play this game.

188
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Okay, there you go.

189
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,020
And then...

190
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,760
Okay, I still remember how to play this game.

191
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,180
That's good.

192
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,560
That's good to know.

193
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,980
That's really good to know that I still remember.

194
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,100
Oh my god!

195
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,620
And I still remember that I gotta kill all the animals!

196
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,940
I mean... you know, not kill, but like, you know...

197
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,420
They're invasive species.

198
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay, guys?

199
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,600
Guys!

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,780
If Florida is allowed to like...

201
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,440
Kill all the iguanas in their local area...

202
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,880
Then I should be allowed to like... get rid of the invasive species here.

203
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:16,860
Uh...

204
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,640
Are you sure?

205
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,260
I'm pretty sure these raptors are not...

206
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,420
Oh!

207
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,800
That's an alpha raptor!

208
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,160
I'll leave.

209
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,740
I'm pretty sure...

210
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm pretty sure these raptors are not...

211
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,960
Are not native to Sandland.

212
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,860
There's no way.

213
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,340
Yeah!

214
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,180
You guys didn't know?

215
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,840
Oh, you guys didn't watch my Shadow of the Wild.

216
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,900
Uh... stream.

217
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,340
Yeah, Florida has an iguana problem right now.

218
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,520
Uh... where like, iguanas are considered an invasive species.

219
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,840
And because of that...

220
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,540
Uh... Florida has put out a decree out...

221
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,900
For all Floridians...

222
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,180
To like, you know...

223
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,920
Kill any iguanas they see on site.

224
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,360
Or like, eat them, I guess.

225
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,170
What is this?

226
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,130
Oh, this is where like...

227
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,890
Rao committed like, murder.

228
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,530
A war crime.

229
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,250
How many invasive species does Florida have?

230
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,270
Like...

231
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,750
A lot?

232
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,970
It's Florida.

233
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,690
It is.

234
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,730
Guys, it's Florida.

235
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,810
There's nothing in the area.

236
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,370
And the one who pulled the trigger on that bomb...

237
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,250
It's you, Rao!

238
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,090
You committed a war crime!

239
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,250
Was the commander of the Royal Army Tank Corps.

240
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,510
Me.

241
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,870
Oh, I see.

242
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,510
Yeah, and...

243
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,310
Not Flor...

244
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,910
Sandland is not so great anymore, is it?

245
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,030
Ha ha ha!

246
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,430
Maybe Forestland was better.

247
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:08,490
Ready?

248
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,310
Of what?

249
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,590
Oh my god, don't let the Valorant players find out about Aquinium.

250
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,110
Oh, woah.

251
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,030
Okay, I guess you're not as important.

252
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,110
Father, you have a dad?

253
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,230
No way!

254
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,250
Oh my god!

255
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,610
A dad?

256
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,470
Why is that a surprise?

257
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,650
I don't understand.

258
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,090
Okay, I boosted the volume up a little bit.

259
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,310
How is that possible?

260
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,010
You mean you didn't come out from somewhere?

261
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,950
Self-replication?

262
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,890
Like those lizards?

263
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,850
Do you guys know there's a type of lizard that just clones itself?

264
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:46,930
Literally, the females pretend to bang each other to replicate, like, males, and then they just clone themselves.

265
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,520
Kroa?

266
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,660
How did he hear of him?

267
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,240
The fuck is this guy?

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Can I go to Forestland yet?

269
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm tired of sad.

270
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,310
I don't know who I am.

271
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,530
Let's cut to the chase.

272
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,290
I'm gonna need you to hand over that Aquinium to me.

273
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,150
This is my first time seeing a demon up close.

274
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,790
No, it's Elvis, guys!

275
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,710
I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

276
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,330
Don't move.

277
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,670
I won't give you another warning.

278
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:37,910
Tch.

279
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,590
What am I doing?

280
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,910
What am I doing?

281
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,330
What?

282
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,390
Oh!

283
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,690
What?

284
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,750
Shoot the humans!

285
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,630
Phew.

286
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,090
Almost had me.

287
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,330
But...

288
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,210
playtime's over.

289
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,170
Wrong.

290
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,830
I'm just getting started.

291
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,730
What?

292
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,690
What?

293
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,570
What did I do?

294
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,790
I just punched the floor.

295
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:17,970
What?

296
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,250
Retreat!

297
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,170
Oh, my god!

298
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,850
There was a cr- Oh, okay.

299
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,950
Who cares about these guys?

300
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,730
What the- Bro, what?

301
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,270
B is above!

302
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,150
You may survive a fall, but they're people.

303
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,290
They're humans.

304
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,650
Humans!

305
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,090
They are flesh bags!

306
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,190
That doesn't mean they will survive!

307
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,430
And then everybody dies!

308
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,070
Mistakes!

309
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,870
Thank you for the super chat!

310
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,210
Thank you!

311
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,430
That's mean!

312
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,260
I got banned in my mouth.

313
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
Anyway, where are we?

314
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,020
Oh, we are like in another little temple thing.

315
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,000
Ruins it looks like.

316
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,460
I never thought all of this was under our feet.

317
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,180
We don't have time for sightseeing.

318
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,880
General Croa and his troops can't be all that far.

319
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,080
Let's find a way out before we are spotted.

320
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay.

321
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,260
Alright.

322
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,360
We gotta get out of here.

323
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,300
Oh, this is the second ruins that I have to do!

324
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,480
Oh my god, am I gonna find like...

325
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,720
Am I gonna find like... an Apple Watch?

326
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,520
Because this is like in the future, right?

327
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,720
So like am I...

328
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,660
Am I gonna find like an Apple Watch?

329
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,500
And like PCs and waifus here?

330
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,440
Alright, let me boost up the volume.

331
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,060
I boosted up the volume a little bit.

332
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,740
So I can like upgrade it.

333
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,420
Yeah, because this is apparently like in the distant future.

334
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,400
Like Star Wars.

335
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,160
Like how Star Wars is in the distant future.

336
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,860
Uh, Sand Land is like in the distant future.

337
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,920
Alright, we got upgrade.

338
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,060
Raise this BS of loss attack when HP is low.

339
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,180
My HP is never low though.

340
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,060
That's the thing.

341
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
Increase potency of the Rush Special.

342
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,560
Increase deployment speed for...

343
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,500
Okay, we should get...

344
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,400
We should re-raise the darkness.

345
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,480
Oh, I have not been leveled...

346
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,840
Guys, I think I have not been leveling up guys.

347
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,880
I just realized there's like...

348
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,800
There's a lot of things I have not been leveling up.

349
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,340
I wanna get that so I can get the top one.

350
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,180
The BS of buff thing.

351
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,300
Okay, we have like a lot of ally points too.

352
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,100
I feel like...

353
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,640
I don't really need to get items.

354
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,700
I just need to upgrade Raul.

355
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,500
Because like his tank shit was actually so...

356
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,040
Was actually really good for me.

357
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,900
Uh...

358
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,340
I guess like dropping more items maybe?

359
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,140
Yeah, we need items.

360
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,720
Nevermind.

361
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,460
We need inventory.

362
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,660
Uh...

363
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,040
Alright.

364
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,560
Apple AR contact lens.

365
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,800
Thank you for the super chat, Mori.

366
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,540
Thank you, thank you.

367
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,920
Did you guys hear about the...

368
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,720
You know like...

369
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,040
What is that device?

370
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,640
That device where you...

371
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,380
Where you put it on?

372
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,420
Um...

373
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,360
And it ended up being like a...

374
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,080
Oh my gosh.

375
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,580
I'm trying to remember what this device was.

376
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,120
It was so...

377
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,780
The trailer was so fucking dumb.

378
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
It's apparently like in...

379
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,740
Like a...

380
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,680
A universal translator.

381
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,420
Or it can act as a universal translator.

382
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,560
Uh...

383
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,120
Where you like wear it and then when you're talking...

384
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,840
It translates what you're saying in real time.

385
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,760
But then it ended up being like a fucking scam.

386
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,920
Hahahaha!

387
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,680
So I remember the trailer was like...

388
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,800
It was so fucking stupid.

389
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,620
And it was like some...

390
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm gonna beat you up.

391
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,620
Oh my fist is stronger than you.

392
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,020
Uh...

393
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,160
What's up with having an exoskeleton when my fist can beat the shit out of you?

394
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,680
The AI clip thing?

395
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

396
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,620
The AI clip thing!

397
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,640
Yeah, the AI pin!

398
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,120
It was...

399
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,720
It had a really dumb name.

400
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,360
Can't remember what it was called.

401
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,860
Yeah, it had a really stu...

402
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Okay, I'm gonna...

403
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,900
I'm gonna bring a tank in here.

404
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,060
Doesn't matter.

405
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,980
Give me a sec.

406
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,780
Little scorpion.

407
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,800
Okay, he's dead anyway.

408
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,500
Oops.

409
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,500
Hahaha!

410
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,600
It's okay.

411
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,900
The humane!

412
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,020
Was it the humane?

413
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh my god, please don't be too fat.

414
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,320
Nooooo!

415
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,440
Somebody close the hatch!

416
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,040
Raul and Anne!

417
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,180
You do not need to look out, Raul and Anne.

418
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,340
Literally, sit inside!

419
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,540
Hahaha!

420
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,460
Hahaha!

421
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,380
Bro!

422
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,420
Sit inside and close the hatch!

423
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,180
Like, what the fuck!

424
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,720
I hate my team.

425
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,900
Oh, I am able to...

426
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,360
Oh my god.

427
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,920
I hate you guys so much.

428
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,640
Hahaha!

429
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,160
Why can't you just close the door?

430
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,240
I don't understand!

431
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
You don't need to have it open!

432
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,320
Okay, we have to go this way, I think.

433
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,340
Oh no, that's just loot.

434
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
It doesn't...

435
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,140
It doesn't...

436
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,640
If you close the hatch, that's the thing.

437
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,060
It can't fit if you close the...

438
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,240
That's what hatches are for!

439
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,780
If they made a door for it, you're supposed to be able to close it!

440
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,820
Yay!

441
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,800
Guys, I realized...

442
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,540
I realized today...

443
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,420
Yesterday, last night...

444
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,880
That I never posted my schedule on the community post.

445
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,720
So I bet a lot of my, like, YouTube viewers are like...

446
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,040
Like, the ones that don't follow me on Twitter...

447
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,580
Are really confused on when I'm streaming.

448
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,840
And they're just looking at, like...

449
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,820
They're like...

450
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,970
They're like looking at my waiting rooms to figure out...

451
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,340
I realized I never post...

452
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,840
I've been so busy, holy shit.

453
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,780
Everyday has been like a lot of work everyday.

454
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,540
I also just realized I forgot to answer an important work message.

455
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,160
Oops!

456
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,580
Oh wait, where am I?

457
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
Did I not make it?

458
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,880
Oh my god.

459
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,940
You mean this isn't a gorilla waiting?

460
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,900
Yeah, for them it's like...

461
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,820
Gorilla Weekend.

462
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,180
I was like, oops.

463
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,540
Oops.

464
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,620
I knew I forgot something.

465
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,800
Alright.

466
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Oh my god, motorcyclists are so hard to drive.

467
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay, we don't care about these guys.

468
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,640
I just realized that these guys are like...

469
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Useless.

470
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,580
I don't even like...

471
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,840
I barely ever leveled up from them.

472
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,760
Anyway.

473
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,700
No!

474
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,020
No!

475
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
There's a pothole!

476
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,380
What's the point of paying taxpayer money if they don't fix this?

477
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,800
I don't know.

478
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,280
I can't believe it!

479
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,700
The king takes so much money from me!

480
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,100
The king of Sandland is always taking money from me and they don't fix the potholes?

481
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,360
God damn it!

482
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,960
This is why the monarchy was a mistake.

483
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,520
Why have we not overthrown the king yet?

484
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,700
I can't believe it.

485
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,400
It's a ruin.

486
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,720
Somebody should fix the potholes in the ruins.

487
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh my god, there's snakes.

488
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
Let's take this fist.

489
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,160
Oh shit!

490
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm sorry.

491
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,060
Alright.

492
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,520
Wait.

493
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,360
Give me a sec.

494
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Give me a sec.

495
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,740
Don't worry.

496
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,260
I'll deal with you soon.

497
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,400
Guys, it's not overkill.

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,920
Okay, I need to get off the tank now.

499
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,420
This is not overkill, okay?

500
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,260
Wait, there was nothing here!

501
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,780
Wait, the snakes looted my...

502
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,600
The snakes looted it!

503
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,620
I can't believe it!

504
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
They don't even have hands!

505
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,800
Okay.

506
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,060
I really don't have to care about this.

507
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,380
I don't need to level up with the snakes.

508
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,140
It's just a distraction.

509
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,820
I can't believe it.

510
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,260
What are you gonna do with my items?

511
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:19,060
All I'm saying is that the king should be responsible with fixing the potholes in the ruins as well.

512
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,880
Also, no matter how good of an official you are, somebody will complain about something.

513
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,900
And that's me.

514
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,720
I'm somebody.

515
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,460
And I'm always complaining.

516
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,080
Yeah, what

517
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,040
happened?

518
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,220
I guess the classics never go out of style.

519
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,400
No pointy stakes lining the bottom, though.

520
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,400
At least they were humane enough not to impale us.

521
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,820
Oh, maybe there's monsters in the pit.

522
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,300
Seems like you spoke too soon.

523
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,640
So, like, the deaths won't be instant because that's what I will do if I want to...

524
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,800
fucking kill somebody in-game.

525
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,220
I knew it!

526
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,740
I knew it!

527
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,020
But there should be more, though.

528
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,540
I'm starting to think we'd have been better off fighting the Forestland Army instead.

529
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,380
You've never even seen the Forestland Army!

530
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,820
Affiliate, thank you for the 10 gift-a-ships!

531
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,000
Thank you!

532
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,220
What are you doing, Prince?

533
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,360
Time to throw down.

534
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,660
Huh?

535
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Like I said, time to fight!

536
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,980
Quiet!

537
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,120
Wait, why?

538
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,340
You didn't tell me what to do!

539
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,700
What is she doing?

540
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
Is she a send-a-bee speaker?

541
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,880
Oh my gosh, she's a fucking freak!

542
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,020
She talks to bugs!

543
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,260
You goddamn Forestlander!

544
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,520
This is why there's a gate that separates between Sandland and Forestland.

545
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,100
Let's go to the forest.

546
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,620
Biggie, please.

547
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,960
Incredible.

548
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,760
Well, I'll be... plucked from the jaws of death by a little girl!

549
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,260
They're literally bugs.

550
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,000
I can just send out a vending machine!

551
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,780
I know!

552
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,380
They must have been so scared of me that they ran off!

553
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,340
Typical forest people!

554
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,060
Go back to your trees!

555
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,520
Jeez!

556
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,180
Sandland people don't need oxygen!

557
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,140
We have sand!

558
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,860
And now water apparently, so I don't know why we're still sandland because we have water now.

559
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,400
Makes me wonder if there is a water land.

560
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,320
Like how deep does it go?

561
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,540
Tree-huggers!

562
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,900
You think you're so much better than me just because you have trees!

563
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,100
Well, we have- we just have water now.

564
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,720
So yeah, how you gonna- how you gonna survive when we have the monopoly on the water?

565
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,860
Where the hell do I go?

566
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,120
Oh, it's this way.

567
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,740
Wait, how do I get up?

568
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,360
Oh, it's over here.

569
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,820
Okay.

570
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah, how you water all your trees forest land if we have all the water?

571
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,300
A person couldn't fit through that crack.

572
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,020
Yeah, why would I want trees when we have sand and more sand?

573
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,160
I wanna see fire world true.

574
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,840
What the fuck?

575
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,700
Do all you guys know what they're saying?

576
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,460
It's like we can understand each other in a weird way.

577
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,220
You can communicate with animals?

578
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,500
Just like Prince's older sister, Lily.

579
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,100
She had a similar power as well.

580
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,200
I have a sister?

581
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,880
What happened to her?

582
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,520
I had a sister.

583
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,980
I think.

584
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,140
What the fuck happened to Lilith?

585
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,860
Like this is the first time I've heard about my sister.

586
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,460
No secret doors either, huh?

587
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,380
Wait, Bielse.

588
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,720
Your sister's name is Lilith?

589
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,840
Yeah.

590
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,380
That's funny.

591
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
Your sister?

592
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,540
My sister has the same name as my mom.

593
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,000
What?

594
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,240
You're my...

595
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,240
niece?

596
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,200
What?

597
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,260
Wait a minute.

598
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,060
Wait a minute.

599
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,820
I'm older than her?

600
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,960
I'm older than her?

601
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,120
What?

602
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:50,660
What?

603
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,020
Oh my god, the plot twist.

604
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,620
Oh, that's it?

605
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,100
Wait.

606
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,540
Oh, that's it?

607
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Wait.

608
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,540
This was such an important information.

609
00:25:59,540 --> 00:25:59,900
This was such an important information.

610
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,020
That's it?

611
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,400
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that this could be my niece?

612
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,980
Like, is this how we're...

613
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,720
Okay, I guess this is how we're ending the conversation.

614
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,020
Apparently.

615
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,320
What do you mean?

616
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,960
I need clarification.

617
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,800
And what's your father's name, young lady?

618
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,860
Why do you wanna know that?

619
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,900
I don't know.

620
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,720
Potentially, you could be my niece.

621
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,760
Don't worry.

622
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Just tell us.

623
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,420
Jam.

624
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,420
Jam?

625
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,820
Bread and Jam?

626
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,780
Wait.

627
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,100
Isn't the king of Forestland named Jam?

628
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,080
Oh my god, you're royalty?

629
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,780
Yeah.

630
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,440
Bread imprisoned my father.

631
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,380
Bread and Jam!

632
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,540
I'm fighting to free him.

633
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,200
Oh my god, is this a Toriyama?

634
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,340
I knew it!

635
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,280
You really are Fiend Princess Lilith's daughter!

636
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,840
What?

637
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,560
My mother was a Fiend?

638
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,580
You have demon?

639
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,840
Hold on.

640
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,600
Your father's King Jam?

641
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,920
You're a princess?

642
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,360
Where are you?

643
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,860
Thank you for the five gift of ships.

644
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,160
Thank you!

645
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,180
Dummy!

646
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,100
You just had to raise a rat!

647
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,720
Okay, we were yelling long before this.

648
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

649
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,000
I didn't mean to scare you again.

650
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,640
I knew it.

651
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,800
That's the same power Lady Lilith had.

652
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,540
Uh-huh.

653
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,040
And I knew you smelled weird.

654
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,300
Oh, bro.

655
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,160
What the fuck?

656
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,020
That's not how you talk to women, Biazl.

657
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,160
You don't just say that.

658
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,940
How can you be so calm about this?

659
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,880
A human marrying a fiend?

660
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,280
Whoa.

661
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,800
It happens.

662
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,380
Oh, wow.

663
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,160
I mean, people get freaky.

664
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,660
Anyway, that's not important.

665
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,300
This is my mom we're talking about.

666
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,260
If she was a fiend...

667
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,300
That's right.

668
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,720
You're one of us!

669
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,460
One of us!

670
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,340
One of us!

671
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,080
Half human and half fiend.

672
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,820
Wait, but you don't have the... Why aren't you not pink?

673
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm not that dumb.

674
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,240
But...

675
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,640
Why?

676
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,500
Is being a demon such a shameful thing to you?

677
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,020
Oh my God, Doki.

678
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,080
You can just ask somebody.

679
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,220
What?

680
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,020
Why they're not pink.

681
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,520
Okay, but it really complicates things.

682
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,880
Okay, now that I know you're part of the family, I'm okay with you being a forest lander.

683
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,720
Don't kill me, don't kill me.

684
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,580
Save it for later.

685
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,780
We have to think of a way out of here.

686
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,580
Hey, these things can't be your family, right?

687
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,960
Look, we all can make an exception.

688
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
As she's family.

689
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,440
How about asking them if they know how to get out of here?

690
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,650
Sure, okay.

691
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,130
I can try, but don't get your hopes up.

692
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,040
Alright.

693
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,800
Let's see.

694
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,360
Alright, talk to those bugs.

695
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,760
And tell us how to get out of here.

696
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,680
Sorry for scaring you, again.

697
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,720
We would like to leave ASAP.

698
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,640
Do you know a way out?

699
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,780
Wait, then she's not an illegal alien.

700
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,140
Because, like, she's related to Beelzebub.

701
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,220
And Beelzebub clearly has citizenship in Sand Land.

702
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,560
So it's fine.

703
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,580
Because, like, Lilith was from Sand Land.

704
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,860
So she should have dual citizenship.

705
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,280
You should be have dual citizenship?

706
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,580
Why are you not happy?

707
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,440
You should be happy that you're half demon.

708
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
You get to live forever.

709
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,820
Or not forever, but like half of forever.

710
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,240
Is it this way?

711
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,140
I think so.

712
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,760
Oh yeah, I mean this means I get out.

713
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,880
Yeah!

714
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
She has diplomatic immunity.

715
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,080
And she has dual citizenship.

716
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,720
Oh.

717
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,620
I'm back here.

718
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,820
Okay.

719
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,700
Whoops.

720
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,560
How do I... whoops.

721
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,360
Oh my god.

722
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,000
Okay, there we go.

723
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,180
How much is half of forever?

724
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,080
I don't know.

725
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
Half of forever.

726
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,340
Alright, up we go.

727
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,640
I can't believe it.

728
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,280
She was... she was always allowed to be here.

729
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,980
Now just not walk that way.

730
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,580
Just walk the right side.

731
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,360
Wow!

732
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,100
Okay, how is...

733
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,680
Okay, this is not as dangerous as I thought.

734
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,660
Like, what the fuck?

735
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,340
I literally can just walk up.

736
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,620
Oh no!

737
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh my... okay, what the fuck?

738
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,820
Okay, that was actually scary.

739
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,560
The floor is fragile here too.

740
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,960
Like that's not even as big of a...

741
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,540
Okay, guys, I like...

742
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,420
Okay, like I might as well just fall down.

743
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,320
It's just faster.

744
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,420
It's literally just faster than running past the fucking falling blocks.

745
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,040
Alright.

746
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,160
Fuck this.

747
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,740
And then I'll just run over here.

748
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,060
And then I'll run over here.

749
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,920
There you go.

750
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,120
This is actually a lot easier than what the fuck that was.

751
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,840
Oh!

752
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Or use the bike.

753
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,400
Sorry.

754
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,460
Guys, you know I don't listen.

755
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,000
I did it.

756
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,800
I used the bike.

757
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,960
You have friends?

758
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,380
Oh, this is where I had to go.

759
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,360
You have friends?

760
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,400
Not anymore when he fired.

761
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,220
Now you're a freak.

762
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,920
No, I'm joking.

763
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,380
I'm joking.

764
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:38,040
The thing is, this discovery just threw a wrench into everything the Resistance stands for.

765
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,120
Protecting the country from fiends.

766
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,920
What?

767
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,820
Bro, they're equally as racist.

768
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,540
They're racist against demons.

769
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,840
The rifle plan justified its coup.

770
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,020
The two claimed King Luke was a fiend who was controlling King Jam.

771
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,160
We all thought it was a lie.

772
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,540
That's why we kept fighting.

773
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,740
But if my mother, our queen, really was a fiend...

774
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,820
Oh my god!

775
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,820
That xenophobe!

776
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,240
Oh, sorry.

777
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,920
Is it...

778
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,940
Oh my god!

779
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,680
It calls the Resistance's whole raison d'être into question.

780
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,340
Wait, the entire Resistance was against demons?

781
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,480
Bro, what the f- Like, what is this story?

782
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,060
It's nonsense.

783
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,240
Lady Lilith would never enslave a man.

784
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,520
The whole Resistance was about killing demons.

785
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,700
I'd like to believe you.

786
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,720
I would.

787
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,240
But with my mom gone...

788
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,800
Oh, sorry.

789
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,980
Xenophobe.

790
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,980
You have money.

791
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,560
Gone where?

792
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,900
What's my sis been up to while all this is going on?

793
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,860
She's dead.

794
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,620
The Force and our machines of brave heroes slew her.

795
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,120
Bro, what?

796
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,800
My sister is dead too?

797
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,100
Huh?

798
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,380
That's ridiculous!

799
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,220
As exists whatever means to be a demon.

800
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,340
Yeah!

801
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,080
She's literally a demon!

802
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,460
How would they kill a demon?

803
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,620
Not even I could beat her!

804
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,680
Not once!

805
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,480
You say that, but the Force has been telling you the truth.

806
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,180
No, I couldn't find out if she's hot or not.

807
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:21,940
I had to seek out a trace.

808
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,320
I'm not a demon.

809
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm a demon.

810
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,580
No way!

811
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,300
V!

812
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,000
We're finding my sister!

813
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,580
Say no more!

814
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,980
You mean you're coming with me to...

815
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,580
Oh, thank God!

816
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,340
Yes, I am!

817
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,620
Yeah, I guess so.

818
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,540
Please take me to Forrest Land!

819
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,960
Please!

820
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,100
We're dying from the lack of oxygen!

821
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,540
You're coming too, Ral?

822
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,900
Absolutely.

823
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,040
I've got to get that equipment.

824
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,600
I'm going to get the uranium back.

825
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,900
I couldn't hope for stronger allies!

826
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,860
What is this game?

827
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,140
Just to be clear, I'm not going to have to leave the Resisters!

828
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,660
Okay, not gonna lie, the second half of the story is fucking wild!

829
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,520
Resistance!

830
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Resistance!

831
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,140
Oh, it's like having a whole army on our side!

832
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
Are you even listening?

833
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,380
I can't believe my big sis lost to someone.

834
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,840
Bro, I can't believe your big sis might be dead!

835
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,480
There's someone stronger than me out there!

836
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,500
Shouldn't you be more, you know, worried about her?

837
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,760
There's no way!

838
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,120
How do you kill a demon?

839
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,060
They'll just go back to hell and then you can like get them back from hell, right?

840
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,000
Like how can you kill a demon if you... if they're already technically dead?

841
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,900
Just like bring them back from hell!

842
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,360
Alright, I don't really care to be fair about all these monsters around me.

843
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,980
Depends on the lore.

844
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,680
I guess like he killed like Japanese demons?

845
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,420
Because this is based off of like Japanese demons, right?

846
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,720
So techni- I guess you can because of Inuyasha.

847
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,980
That's like my- That's my knowledge of- That's my knowledge of- Of like Yo-kai.

848
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,640
Oh, and Yo-kai watch.

849
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,660
In Inuyasha you can!

850
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,500
My source.

851
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
Oh wait, uh, B.

852
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
Okay, there has to be like...

853
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,560
Uh...

854
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,900
There must be like extra loot here or something.

855
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,460
Because why would there be like rocks covering this pathway?

856
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,580
Alright.

857
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Oh, Queen Scorpion!

858
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,700
What the fuck?

859
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,240
Alright, what the heck is the queen?

860
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,280
Sorry, what the hell is that?

861
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,180
I'm still like self-censoring myself from Minecraft.

862
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,560
Ever since Minecraft.

863
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,860
I couldn't stop.

864
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,460
I couldn't stop the family friendly.

865
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,760
Alright, this is easy though.

866
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
This is not too bad.

867
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,540
Oh my god, he hasn't even hit me.

868
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,620
Bro, what the fuck?

869
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
You're just garbage.

870
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,200
You can't even hit me.

871
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,580
You're too slow!

872
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,440
Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

873
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,320
Alright, this is like the easiest fight ever.

874
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,880
Holy shit, where are your children?

875
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,420
They should put you in a home.

876
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,360
That's a lot of loot.

877
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,460
Yay!

878
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,080
Okay, and then...

879
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,180
Well, I can get off the thing.

880
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,880
I need to find this chest.

881
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,580
Is there stuff here?

882
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,560
Oh, nice.

883
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,280
Okay, there's...

884
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,660
Oh my god, there's a lot of loot.

885
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,480
Nice.

886
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,680
That just got 25 XP for that?

887
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,040
Wait, that's so sad.

888
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,140
Oh, I got silver coin that I can give to...

889
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,380
Nhajin Boo!

890
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,880
Alright.

891
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,320
The thing is...

892
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,720
The thing is though, like...

893
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,500
I think like...

894
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,800
Toriyama...

895
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,990
helped write the second half of the story too.

896
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,960
So, it's...

897
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,060
It's actually...

898
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,720
The second half of the story is so fucking wild.

899
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,280
I really did not expect the story to go this way.

900
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,620
Oh my god.

901
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,900
Like, oh my god!

902
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,340
Wait!

903
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,580
We don't have...

904
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,820
Wait, but like...

905
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,140
Okay, to be fair, like...

906
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,720
Uh...

907
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,580
Wait, no!

908
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,360
I was never born in forest land!

909
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,220
Am I allowed to be in forest land?

910
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,320
Guys!

911
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,660
Is there...

912
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,720
Are there passports in this world?

913
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,980
Guys, are there passports?

914
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,340
No!

915
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Is it this way?

916
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Have I gotten this way before?

917
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,440
A pro...

918
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,680
Oh my god.

919
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,580
Oh no!

920
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,340
Oh no!

921
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,860
Oh no!

922
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,500
Guys, we're illegally entering forest land!

923
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,360
No!

924
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,360
What are you doing to me, niece?

925
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,060
Guys.

926
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,860
Guys.

927
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,100
Guys, no...

928
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,440
No snitches, okay guys?

929
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,560
No snitches, okay guys?

930
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,220
Alright.

931
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,160
How do I get...

932
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh wait, this way.

933
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,340
Okay.

934
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,180
I got a bit lost in the ruins.

935
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,440
Okay, no.

936
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
It was not this way.

937
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,440
It was right here.

938
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,860
Alright.

939
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,760
Now clearly there's like a passport system.

940
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,380
There's like immigration.

941
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,040
Because like the general was like, wait a minute.

942
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,500
You're not supposed to be here.

943
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,720
You're from forest land.

944
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,040
So clearly there are like immigration rules from forest land to sand land.

945
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,000
Because like the general was not very happy about like I'm being here by like non...

946
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,660
by like non-legal means.

947
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,000
And there are citizenships.

948
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:09,860
But...

949
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,700
But how do I go between like different...

950
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:11,840
Whoa.

951
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,160
Oops.

952
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,140
Okay.

953
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,140
Maybe I need to buy...

954
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,680
Okay, here we go.

955
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,380
The manga is very short.

956
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
Why aren't you shopping yet?

957
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,620
That is such a wild stain.

958
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,380
Bro, I've already passed the manga...

959
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,100
All right.

960
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,140
Let's see.

961
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,680
Guys.

962
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,860
how do I drop?

963
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,980
Okay, press A.

964
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,120
Guys, I'm trying to head to forest land.

965
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,020
This is why I'm not done with the game yet.

966
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,360
This game is like 30 hours long, guys!

967
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,120
Alright, we made it.

968
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,000
Yay!

969
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,500
We made it!

970
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,980
Wait, is this another boss?

971
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,920
Wait, the ceiling is collapsing?

972
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,440
Oh my god.

973
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,280
Oh my god, please!

974
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,960
Oh my god.

975
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
I went so fast too!

976
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,660
That's it, I'm using my legs.

977
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm using my fucking legs now.

978
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,340
Now just walk over here.

979
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,900
Oh wait, wait.

980
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,640
Oh wait, you can't cheese this anymore!

981
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,020
You actually have to be faster!

982
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,480
They don't have platforms on the other side.

983
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,740
Oh.

984
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,520
Alright.

985
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,520
That was... okay, that was anti-climatic.

986
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,620
Okay.

987
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,420
Maybe I'll walk from here.

988
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,640
Are you fucking kidding me?!

989
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,260
Let me through!

990
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,740
It's not my fault my bike is like 200 pounds.

991
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,020
Bro, that bike is not... are you serious?

992
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,280
Are you serious?

993
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,520
Okay.

994
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,900
You had to destroy it because there's no way I was faster than the collapsible floor.

995
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,900
Guys, I don't know if you guys noticed but my bike is made of titanium.

996
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,460
Alright, here we go.

997
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,560
Made it!

998
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,830
Made it?

999
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,210
Wait, the check mark lied to me.

1000
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,010
It said five meters.

1001
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,370
Wait, now it says 41 meters.

1002
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,130
Why is it lying to me?

1003
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,210
Oh wait, but this is like not from the checkpoint.

1004
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,750
Does that mean there's extra loot?

1005
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,350
I knew it.

1006
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,930
Thank god for the yellow.

1007
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,210
Alright, is there an extra loot over here?

1008
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,070
Oh, mine!

1009
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,730
To upgrade better dragoons.

1010
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,470
And dragoons.

1011
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,110
Alright.

1012
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,070
Okay, now we made it.

1013
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,850
Oh my god, I see the outside.

1014
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,470
Oh my god, how did you get here?

1015
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,550
How did you get here before me?

1016
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,690
Living in ancient ruins might be more illegal than illegal immigration?

1017
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:28,690
No!

1018
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,850
Because if it were, the British Museum wouldn't be the British Museum.

1019
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,430
But none of them would be the British Museum.

1020
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:36,810
Don't worry about me.

1021
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,350
I don't want you to run this time.

1022
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,810
Hand over the Equini.

1023
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,530
Don't get any funny item.

1024
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,950
Ha, sounds like you've got a wrong one.

1025
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,770
You're no match for us without being surrounded by your troopers.

1026
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,540
Wow, someone's real brave now that you've got me outnumbered.

1027
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,650
Didn't know you were such a coward.

1028
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,330
You...

1029
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,990
Who are you calling a coward?

1030
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,610
A coward?

1031
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,610
Me?!

1032
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,070
How dare you!

1033
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,830
I killed a real person in game!

1034
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,430
Wait, what?

1035
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,750
Don't let... oh shit!

1036
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,830
Wait, drive...

1037
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,290
Drive Korra... oh wait, okay.

1038
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,050
I gotta kill him.

1039
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,590
Okay.

1040
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,990
That's what a tank is for.

1041
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,150
All right, here you go.

1042
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,250
Oh my god, why are you so fast?

1043
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:33,890
It's okay.

1044
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,810
Dude, he's way too fast.

1045
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,290
What do you mean?

1046
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,790
I literally have a tank.

1047
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:41,990
Like, we're the same.

1048
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,810
How do you stay still?

1049
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:46,790
How?

1050
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,170
I don't understand!

1051
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,670
How is he so fast?

1052
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,590
Okay, wait, wait.

1053
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,990
What if I... what if I like destroy this?

1054
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,070
Can't destroy this?

1055
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,110
How do you stay still?

1056
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,290
Wait, race?

1057
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,230
I'm supposed to race him?

1058
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,450
Oh, I have to anticipate the...

1059
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,170
Oh!

1060
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,930
You can shoot back?

1061
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,250
That's messed up.

1062
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,790
This is messed up.

1063
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,790
He shoots back, guys.

1064
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,450
I'm not used to people shooting back.

1065
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,470
Okay, maybe we get a bike.

1066
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,370
I'm gonna get a bike.

1067
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:26,750
Okay.

1068
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:29,770
Ugh!

1069
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,870
How do I... how do I stop him?

1070
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,330
Okay.

1071
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:38,690
No.

1072
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,610
Please.

1073
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,750
Oh, what?

1074
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:42,950
How does he hit me?

1075
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,550
Oh, shit.

1076
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,010
My bike.

1077
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,130
Oh, what?

1078
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,830
My bike!

1079
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,590
Oh, guys, guys, it's on fire!

1080
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,330
Guys, it's on fire.

1081
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,710
Not looking so good, but but bike is on fire.

1082
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,830
Oh, I have to ram him?

1083
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,250
Oh, I have to ram him?

1084
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:01,990
Oh, I have to ram him?

1085
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:03,410
Is that it?

1086
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:03,750
Is that it?

1087
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,590
Wait, he's almost dead.

1088
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,650
As I...

1089
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,490
Guys, I know like...

1090
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,130
It looks like he's almost dead.

1091
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,150
Okay.

1092
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,490
I can't believe this.

1093
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:19,010
This boss is actually difficult.

1094
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,770
Wait, what if I said Raiol?

1095
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,250
Wait, if I hit him head on, he takes so much damage.

1096
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,510
Holy shit, he takes so much!

1097
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,790
Wait, I'm DPSing!

1098
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,630
Wait, I'm actually DPSing!

1099
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:36,550
Okay.

1100
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,470
Oh my god, I'm doing projectiles, guys.

1101
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,510
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1102
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,870
Okay, we gotta send in Raiol.

1103
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,170
Where's Raiol?

1104
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,930
How do I send in...

1105
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,610
How do I send in Raiol?

1106
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:50,730
I forgot!

1107
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,290
Guys, how do I...

1108
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,450
How do I send in my extra health?

1109
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,030
Okay.

1110
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,010
It's alright.

1111
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,230
You're like pea shooters.

1112
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,930
Oh, LBLB!

1113
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,570
Vehicle warfare!

1114
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,190
Raiol, you do the thing!

1115
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,890
Raiol, that's a fucking pillar.

1116
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,110
Raiol, please.

1117
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,770
Raiol, please.

1118
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,250
Raiol, please, for the love of god.

1119
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,290
Raiol, please.

1120
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,410
Why did you hit the pillar?

1121
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,490
I can't believe it.

1122
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,790
No!

1123
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,090
No, I can't shoot!

1124
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:39,870
I jammed it!

1125
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,950
Oh my god, he's like hitting me.

1126
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,330
Okay, he's literally one hit.

1127
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,570
I just need to leave this.

1128
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,150
Come on!

1129
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,470
Oh my god, he's literally one hit!

1130
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,910
Okay.

1131
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,310
Leave!

1132
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:54,930
No!

1133
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:56,630
Yes!

1134
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:57,130
Yes!

1135
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,330
Oh, dear.

1136
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,350
I did it!

1137
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,830
That's right.

1138
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,830
Now die!

1139
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:11,830
What?

1140
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,530
Yay, Mernie!

1141
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,410
You?

1142
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,010
What the fuck?

1143
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,470
How?

1144
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,500
Why did you just save me?

1145
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,320
Damn, she's strong.

1146
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,610
Strong!

1147
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,360
Wait,

1148
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,040
it was just that?

1149
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,960
Oh, an entire pillar landed on him!

1150
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,440
What happened to the rest of the pillar?

1151
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,130
Yeah!

1152
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:08,330
Yeah!

1153
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,390
If the game would let me.

1154
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,430
Josie, thank you for the super chat!

1155
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,230
Thank you, thank you!

1156
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,190
She's showing them FPS aiding skills.

1157
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,310
She isn't!

1158
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,650
Thank you for the super chat!

1159
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,490
Thank you, thank you!

1160
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:21,510
Thank you!

1161
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,530
We never even met a real demon before!

1162
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,130
You're from forest land!

1163
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,350
We live in sand land!

1164
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,530
What the fuck?

1165
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,670
I literally saved your life!

1166
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,670
You'll never win!

1167
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,070
Oh yeah, they actually have tanks that are fast.

1168
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,030
How do I get out of here?

1169
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,590
What do you mean?

1170
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,230
They literally had a tank that's so fucking fast!

1171
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,690
Oh, I have to get off.

1172
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,290
God damn it.

1173
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,110
Why do they make such small doors?

1174
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,690
They're not tank accessible.

1175
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,410
Where is my accessibility... here?

1176
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,870
I can't believe it.

1177
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,470
Sometimes I just don't want to use my legs.

1178
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,930
Repair time?

1179
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,250
They'll self-repair themselves.

1180
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,450
By the way, BLs, I've

1181
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,440
been calling you BLs.

1182
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,700
But you're- Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

1183
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,760
Yeah, I'm saying it to you.

1184
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,220
But you're- She's my niece.

1185
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,920
How old am I?

1186
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,240
Yeah, cause she's royalty.

1187
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:35,400
I mean, yeah, it's pretty weird that you're like my niece and everything and that you're half demon.

1188
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,260
What if like a shitty... like... what's the word?

1189
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,320
Like, you know, she's half demon and all she gets is she can talk to fucking bugs?

1190
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,440
Like, what is...

1191
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,120
There's so many other cooler things she could get from being half demon.

1192
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,740
But...

1193
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,780
But all she got was being able to talk to bugs.

1194
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,560
She's not demon-strength.

1195
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,200
She could barely fucking pick...

1196
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,300
It was like one tablet of stone and she was struggling already.

1197
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,480
That is not demon-strength.

1198
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,300
That is like one eighth of demon-strength.

1199
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,380
Wait, how old am I?

1200
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,720
I'm not older than her.

1201
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,560
I mean, I am like the uncle, but still.

1202
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,800
Like, what?

1203
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,160
Can I upgrade yet?

1204
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,020
Oh, I can.

1205
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,440
Okay.

1206
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,260
Uh, I wanted to use this one.

1207
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,520
Like, boost to specific use items.

1208
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,500
Uh, ooh, and we wanna raise XP.

1209
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,920
I like how we can still not upgrade Anne.

1210
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,620
Like, she's...

1211
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,140
She's just there.

1212
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,800
Like...

1213
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,860
Like, she...

1214
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,860
She, like, follows us everywhere.

1215
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,040
But, like, she...

1216
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,000
We can't...

1217
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,800
She doesn't do anything.

1218
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,180
She's just there.

1219
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,120
She's like the moral...

1220
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,160
Yeah, she's like the moral...

1221
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,220
Uh...

1222
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,020
Moral support right now.

1223
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,540
Thanks, Anne.

1224
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,260
I knew I could count on you.

1225
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,040
Yay!

1226
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,240
So...

1227
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,200
So...

1228
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,040
Uh...

1229
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,600
Parapo, thank you for the five gifted ships.

1230
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,060
Thank you.

1231
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,760
Thank you.

1232
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,460
No, please not.

1233
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,660
Please not.

1234
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,860
When can I get to Forest Land?

1235
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,000
Guys, all I wanted to do was Forest Land.

1236
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,380
Oh my god.

1237
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,780
Guys, it'll be fine.

1238
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,320
Guys, I know my bike is on fire, but it'll be okay.

1239
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,380
Where do I have to go?

1240
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,040
Here?

1241
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,000
Oh, I have to go to Espino.

1242
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,060
I can't fast travel right now?

1243
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,140
Oh, is it because I have, like, all these guys chasing me?

1244
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,800
Is Forest Land real?

1245
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,540
Forest Land has to be real!

1246
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,580
Anne's from Forest Land and my sister is too!

1247
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,960
It has to be real!

1248
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,280
Okay, now I can fast travel.

1249
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,880
Good thing we have this safe place to rest.

1250
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,240
So, what was it you wanted to do?

1251
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:32,860
Yeah.

1252
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,420
Wait, why did we do all that?

1253
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,660
Before we enter Forest Land, I want to make sure we retrieve all the Aquanium in Sand Land.

1254
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,620
You mean there's more?

1255
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,580
There's more Aquanium?

1256
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,360
I suspect so, but I can't say for sure.

1257
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,380
I don't get it.

1258
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,560
Sand Land used two battleships in the Great War.

1259
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,780
One of them was the Lysab Battleship and the other was the Merrick Battleship.

1260
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,000
Ah, I see.

1261
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,380
So those battleships' Aquanium power sources might still be inside them.

1262
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,880
It's a possibility.

1263
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,880
I have to go to another battleship?

1264
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:11,600
Please!

1265
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,020
Rarrel, nobody cares about Aquanium anymore!

1266
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,680
He's well aware of the locations of Sand Land's Aquanium.

1267
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,080
I just want to head to Forest Land!

1268
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,580
I don't know if you've made it to the Merrick Battleship in the Far Northeast yet, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

1269
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,380
Can't you tell General Aray and leave things to the Royal Army?

1270
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,120
I could, but it would be quicker to go there ourselves.

1271
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,800
And we're stronger anyway.

1272
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:40,980
Maybe you're right.

1273
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,500
Their guards were losing, weren't they?

1274
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,240
Well, to be fair, they weren't really guarding.

1275
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,660
While you all go and get the Aquanium, I'll stay behind.

1276
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,860
And wrap up our preparations here, so we'll be ready to leave at a moment's notice.

1277
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,140
To be fair, Admin, we're not really doing much of anything.

1278
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,820
What are we going to do with the Aquanium we've already got?

1279
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,860
Yeah, what are we gonna do with the Aquanium?

1280
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,880
The Forest Land Army might come after us if we keep it on us.

1281
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,960
You have a point, but I don't know where we could hide it.

1282
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,220
Maybe we could ask Mayor Tori.

1283
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,560
Yeah, let's hide it in the village.

1284
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,520
That, like, you know, where all the innocent civilians are.

1285
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,680
Ha ha ha!

1286
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,500
That's a good idea.

1287
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,360
Because an army would never invade... like, would never, you know...

1288
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,980
destroy a poor, innocent city.

1289
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,640
Zeon, thank you for the super chat.

1290
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,480
Thank you, thank you.

1291
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,220
I said four dungeon crawls last time, and I meant it.

1292
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,140
By the way, the 100mm EMP gun and explosive laser from Niajin Buu are very fun.

1293
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,560
Oh, okay.

1294
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,840
I'll get it.

1295
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,900
Alright.

1296
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,760
Let's put all these innocent civilian lives in danger.

1297
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,940
Well, like, except for, like, one.

1298
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,740
You know, I won't mind if one of them dies.

1299
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,520
Is it just my imagination, or has the town gotten more lively?

1300
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,060
Yeah!

1301
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,640
I did my side quest for real this time!

1302
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,020
Wait, where's the...

1303
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,220
Where's Latu?

1304
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,480
Bring me any rare items you find.

1305
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,680
I was told that Niajin Buu is gonna have guns for me.

1306
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,160
Hey!

1307
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,660
Is it just for fun?

1308
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,060
Oh, wait.

1309
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,240
Where are my guns?

1310
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,940
Where are my fucking guns?

1311
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,140
Bring me any rare items you find.

1312
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,340
I didn't have them unlocked!

1313
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,280
I fucking...

1314
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,520
I have 50 chairs, but not...

1315
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,660
But not the guns?

1316
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,900
We don't need guns, guys.

1317
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,500
No!

1318
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,040
The two more sides!

1319
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,500
Okay, I am not doing worse.

1320
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,500
Oh, yeah, we have to upgrade our tanks, right?

1321
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,860
We have to upgrade our vehicles.

1322
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,440
We need...

1323
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,800
Okay, we can upgrade this right now.

1324
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,540
We'll go to level 12.

1325
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,780
Because we don't have enough cobra alloys.

1326
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:01,660
Guys!

1327
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,700
You should've told me...

1328
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,500
Guys, why didn't you tell me to farm the cobra?

1329
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,220
Guys!

1330
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,820
Why didn't you hold my hand and tell me what to do?

1331
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,300
Okay, let's see.

1332
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,840
We need to...

1333
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,420
Uh...

1334
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,540
Customize vehicle.

1335
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,340
Alright, there we go.

1336
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,140
Okay, we got... I know like I have...

1337
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,280
Stronger stuff, right?

1338
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,340
Need upgraded...

1339
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,460
Wait, is this weapon break?

1340
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,580
Wait, it can break?

1341
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,520
Okay, let's see.

1342
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,560
Shots explode on impact with a chance.

1343
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,340
Fire ammo...

1344
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,980
Uh, destroys hard rock.

1345
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,680
I guess we should do that because it's upgraded.

1346
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,380
It is stronger, right?

1347
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,100
Yeah.

1348
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,160
Okay, everything else is weaker.

1349
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,960
So we will not deal with that.

1350
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,100
But that means I can... I should be able to...

1351
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:58,220
Oh, wait.

1352
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,400
Whoops.

1353
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,580
Uh...

1354
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,160
Maybe repair the bike?

1355
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,080
No.

1356
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,680
Bike doesn't need repairs.

1357
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,220
It'll be fine.

1358
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,200
I believe in the bike.

1359
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,140
The bike will be okay, guys.

1360
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,220
It'll be okay.

1361
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,620
How to upgrade the weapons?

1362
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,340
Okay.

1363
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,120
Uh...

1364
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,060
Make sure that... Oh, okay.

1365
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:33,680
This one's...

1366
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,660
Wait, but...

1367
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,740
How is this a blue?

1368
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,080
Built for speed.

1369
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,720
Uh...

1370
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,680
But then a jump?

1371
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,300
What is this?

1372
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,080
Boost recovery, boost gauge... You know what?

1373
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:45,520
Fuck it.

1374
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,740
It's blue, so it's better.

1375
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,280
Oh, okay.

1376
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:50,940
We need that.

1377
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,380
Uh... Quick reloads.

1378
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,040
My scam bike.

1379
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,080
It says rare.

1380
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,660
Reduces energy consumed.

1381
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,520
Oh, my vehicle is too fucking weak.

1382
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,360
Alright, that's fine.

1383
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,120
Uh...

1384
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:05,840
Parts.

1385
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,780
Upgrade parts.

1386
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,300
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,100
We can upgrade parts.

1388
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,680
Never mind.

1389
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,780
We can't.

1390
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,260
Never mind.

1391
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,460
We don't need to, guys.

1392
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,080
Guys, we don't need to upgrade.

1393
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,820
We don't need to upgrade anything.

1394
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,500
Because it's perfect the way it is.

1395
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,580
Let's see.

1396
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,480
Okay.

1397
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,980
Cart is useless.

1398
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,520
Alright.

1399
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,820
I think that's good.

1400
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,260
See you later.

1401
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:28,920
Yeah!

1402
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,040
Alright, we gotta talk to the mayor.

1403
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:33,920
Decades...

1404
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,120
Uh, Marshal, thank you for the super chat.

1405
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:35,980
Thank you, thank you.

1406
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:39,360
Decades later, they will discover that aqueinium is radioactive and all of...

1407
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,300
Oh, no!

1408
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,920
Just like uranium!

1409
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,380
Just like the plates and the cups!

1410
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,520
And the...

1411
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,040
Like the Garfield Cup and the Star Wars Cup!

1412
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,580
Just because they wanted to make it orange!

1413
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,280
So, did you...

1414
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,160
You broke you into some kind of treasure hunt?

1415
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,060
No, sadly.

1416
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,640
It's nothing so fun.

1417
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,480
This is what I think about like...

1418
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,860
You know how like Superman has like x-ray vision?

1419
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:08,060
And like how like some superheroes have x-ray vision?

1420
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,900
I'm just thinking, wouldn't he like increase the potential for like the...

1421
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,800
Like whoever he's x-raying?

1422
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,920
Like, you know, cancer?

1423
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,720
You don't want to know.

1424
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,560
I see.

1425
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,620
It must be quite the treasure indeed then.

1426
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,520
Well, you can use the secret room in the west.

1427
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,340
I'll uh, draw you a map.

1428
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,880
We used it to hide our arms and such during the rebel army days.

1429
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,720
Yeah, he does!

1430
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,420
Superman has x-ray vision.

1431
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,260
I'd feel far safer with it there.

1432
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,880
I'll go and hide.

1433
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,460
I'll hide it for you.

1434
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,320
You're in a hurry, right?

1435
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,520
Leave it with me.

1436
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,040
You gonna be alright on your own?

1437
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,100
Aw, look at you.

1438
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,480
All worried about your knees.

1439
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,600
Shut up!

1440
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,240
I'm not!

1441
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,240
Knees?

1442
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:01,760
Wait, he...

1443
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,340
Wait, really?

1444
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,060
Wait, he actually does?

1445
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,420
Superman gives somebody cancer?

1446
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay, now I need to look that up.

1447
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,780
Okay.

1448
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:20,520
Can Superman give someone cancer from x-ray vision?

1449
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,140
Okay, now I need to know.

1450
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,760
Can Superman give you cancer?

1451
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,480
Yes, so could he deliberately give someone cancer just by looking at them hard enough?

1452
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,080
Uh...

1453
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,140
Oh, apparently!

1454
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,000
Okay.

1455
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,460
Superman's vision doesn't work strictly x-rays.

1456
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:41,220
So overall, it seems unlikely that simply looking at you would...

1457
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,000
Okay, unlikely.

1458
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,820
Okay, good.

1459
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,120
Okay.

1460
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:43,820
So no.

1461
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,060
His type of x-ray vision...

1462
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,000
Oh wait, guys!

1463
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,660
Guys!

1464
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,520
But look at this!

1465
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:53,580
A patient can have up to 180 plus x-rays a year.

1466
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,900
The radiation dosage is small.

1467
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,640
It's not a big deal if he looked at someone for a few seconds.

1468
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,420
Guys!

1469
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,740
It's okay!

1470
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,180
As long as we don't go over 181...

1471
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,620
We'll be fine.

1472
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,780
Like x-rays.

1473
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,920
So like, in a year, if we really want to...

1474
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,580
We can go to the hospital to get like 180 x-rays.

1475
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,200
And we'll be okay.

1476
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,040
Technically.

1477
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,040
Wait, Louis Ling got cancer from Superman?

1478
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,960
That can't be real.

1479
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,420
Now you're making stuff up.

1480
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,060
I feel like that would be a bigger deal.

1481
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,170
Oh no!

1482
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,110
She got it by her own...

1483
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,610
Her own means.

1484
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,910
Not by from Superman.

1485
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,430
Okay.

1486
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,930
Yeah, that would be so fucked up.

1487
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:47,810
I would be like, that's really fucked up.

1488
01:03:53,140 --> 01:04:02,240
I would be like, that's so messed up if they actually wrote that into like an official story.

1489
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,020
Funny story.

1490
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,280
One Spiderman story, MJ dies because...

1491
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:07,900
What?!

1492
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,280
That's a real story?!

1493
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:11,740
Don't even...

1494
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,720
Thank you for the super chat.

1495
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,320
Thank you.

1496
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,180
Thank you.

1497
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,900
There was one Spiderman comic where Peter killed MJ with radioactive spider...

1498
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,260
Okay, I'm sorry.

1499
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,600
Don't let me look that up.

1500
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:26,900
Wait.

1501
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,860
That is from...

1502
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,140
Who the fuck wrote that?

1503
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,040
I need the name.

1504
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,020
Okay.

1505
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:37,660
She...

1506
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,120
Holy shit!

1507
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,940
What is this sentence that I'm reading?

1508
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,520
Oh my God!

1509
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,880
What the fu...

1510
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,420
Who wrote...

1511
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:02,580
Okay, who wrote this?

1512
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,820
That's called Spiderman rain.

1513
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,520
Okay, this is...

1514
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,920
Oh my God!

1515
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:12,480
Okay, this is...

1516
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:12,640
Oh God!

1517
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,980
Okay, I did not realize that was real.

1518
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,380
Oh my god.

1519
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,440
I forgot Spider-Man is like radioactive.

1520
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,400
Because he got bit by a radioactive spider.

1521
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,380
Like all I thought about was like...

1522
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:29,700
You know, I thought about like, you know, like the Incredible Hulk and like Superman.

1523
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,620
But like, oh my gosh.

1524
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:37,840
The hidden monster all along was Spider-Man.

1525
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:47,740
Like, would that mean like all his like, you know, like saliva would be radioactive too?

1526
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,820
Like, what if he like coughs at somebody, you know?

1527
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,400
So, would his bacteria be radioactive?

1528
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,820
Like he could technically bring on the second plague.

1529
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,200
Because his radioactive genes can mutate the bacteria.

1530
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:07,820
And like...

1531
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,020
He could technically start in like the third plague or something.

1532
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,100
If...

1533
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:18,560
Okay, if like radioactive like goo can cause somebody to die.

1534
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,280
Why would you stop there?

1535
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:24,280
Like everything would just be radioactive at that point.

1536
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,440
Okay, that is actually crazy.

1537
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh my god.

1538
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,500
Who is the writer for...

1539
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,940
Who came up with this?

1540
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,480
When was this?

1541
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:34,580
It was 2007?

1542
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,240
Sorry, this was like very...

1543
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,580
Sorry, we diverged a lot.

1544
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,980
But this is actually crazy to read about.

1545
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:52,400
That is actually really crazy to read about just now.

1546
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,360
I was not...

1547
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,720
I was not expecting that.

1548
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,500
Okay, he also wrote for...

1549
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:03,400
Oh, he wrote for like Incredible Hulk, Iron Fist, Ultimate X-Men, Hawkeye, and the Amazing Spider-Man.

1550
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,260
He included the...

1551
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,620
He created the manga version?

1552
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,440
Spider-Man?

1553
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,600
What?

1554
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,140
What the fuck is the manga version?

1555
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,040
Spider-Man!

1556
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:15,580
Wait...

1557
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,380
Okay.

1558
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,140
There is a Marvel manga verse?

1559
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,240
What?

1560
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,120
Why is it called...

1561
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,220
Why is it called the manga verse?

1562
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,000
There is a manga verse by the way.

1563
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,140
Is it just regular Spider-Verse?

1564
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:37,600
I don't know.

1565
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,020
Yeah, he wrote the manga verse Spider-Man.

1566
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,620
But isn't that just a regular like multiverse?

1567
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,020
The Spider-Man multiverse?

1568
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,660
Why does like the multiverse have to have a separate multiverse called the manga verse?

1569
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:52,880
Alright.

1570
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,160
Jesus Christ.

1571
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:54,980
But yeah, this guy.

1572
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,020
Care Andrews.

1573
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:57,940
He wrote that.

1574
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,440
Imagine being in the writer's room for that.

1575
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,480
Snooks, thank you for the super chat.

1576
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:04,840
Thank you.

1577
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,520
Thank you.

1578
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,600
Spider-Man has some bangers.

1579
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,980
Like the time a sad man jumped down his throat.

1580
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,300
What?

1581
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:13,600
Okay.

1582
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:15,960
Is there...

1583
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,220
Okay.

1584
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:16,980
He's...

1585
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:17,880
Aquanium recovery.

1586
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,360
Alright.

1587
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,020
So it's all up to me.

1588
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,380
Why do I have to do everything?

1589
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,640
What's the point of...

1590
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,680
Having an army?

1591
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,840
There were so many people in that one army.

1592
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,180
Alright.

1593
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,320
We gotta go to the...

1594
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,480
Oh, I know about the zombie verse.

1595
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,360
I just...

1596
01:08:59,160 --> 01:08:59,780
I just...

1597
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,280
I was...

1598
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,960
I'm still blown away from that one comic storyline.

1599
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,080
That's insane.

1600
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,920
Like Peter Parker's never gonna like...

1601
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,980
Like he's never gonna bang again.

1602
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,840
Like...

1603
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,220
Like after that.

1604
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,260
Like that man is...

1605
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,600
He's fucking traumatized after that.

1606
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:21,780
Interesting.

1607
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,440
Wait!

1608
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,840
You could like...

1609
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,400
Okay.

1610
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,160
Is this really fucked up for me to say?

1611
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,260
But it gives so many like different storylines.

1612
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,980
100% water for instance.

1613
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,240
It gives like so many different storylines.

1614
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:42,420
Because like technically you could like study the radioactive property.

1615
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,200
I don't know.

1616
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,240
You can use it.

1617
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,940
You can use it to find a cure for cancer at that point.

1618
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:50,620
Right?

1619
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,800
Like if you think about it.

1620
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,260
Toki stop cooking.

1621
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,760
All I'm saying is that you can find the cure for cancer.

1622
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,420
Clear thinking will lead you to victory even when the odds are against you.

1623
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,640
How do I get there?

1624
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,920
I'm so confused.

1625
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,060
Oh, it's here.

1626
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:16,540
I got lost.

1627
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,740
You're talking to the fiend prince.

1628
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,440
I'm like the definition of calm.

1629
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:25,940
Yay!

1630
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,440
All right.

1631
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,320
Time to find some Aquanium.

1632
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,000
What's that?

1633
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,100
Oh, that's a merchant.

1634
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,220
Wait, do you have stuff for me?

1635
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,920
You have an exclamation point.

1636
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,320
Do you have anything for me?

1637
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,320
Can you please...

1638
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:44,340
Hello?

1639
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,940
Why did you walk away?

1640
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,220
Why did you walk away?

1641
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,060
Oh, it's just new stuff.

1642
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:49,580
Okay.

1643
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,660
I don't need any of this.

1644
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,460
See, I told you guys the cutscene heals my bike.

1645
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:55,960
I knew I didn't need to repair my bike.

1646
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,820
Peter Parker's Marvel's version of the puppy that they love to kick.

1647
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,060
He's the only one who gets fucked with hard in the series.

1648
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,240
Thank you, Super Chat Pug.

1649
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:08,620
Thank you.

1650
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,320
Thank you.

1651
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,320
You're harmless though.

1652
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,100
Just doing their best to survive in this harsh land like us.

1653
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,400
That's surprising because I feel like everybody has.

1654
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,100
Like all superheroes have trauma.

1655
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,040
How far is this place?

1656
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,200
I still have to ride it?

1657
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,200
Wait, there's like stuff.

1658
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,220
Wait, is this a town?

1659
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,360
Is this like a free town?

1660
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,680
Oh, it is.

1661
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,800
There are other towns?

1662
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,380
Terugino.

1663
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,580
Where are you?

1664
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,000
Can I steal your citizens?

1665
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,900
I can't believe...

1666
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,520
Guys, there's another town.

1667
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,380
Terugino.

1668
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:46,680
What?

1669
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,180
Why did nobody tell me about the secret town?

1670
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:55,780
Is this where the mayor is?

1671
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,220
Alright, let's see.

1672
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,780
Okay, some of us need to stop cooking.

1673
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,860
Jay, Jay, thank you for the super chat.

1674
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:10,480
Thank you.

1675
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,200
Thank you.

1676
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,020
I'm not gonna.

1677
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,500
I'm not gonna read.

1678
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,300
Thank you.

1679
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:18,600
Thank you.

1680
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,740
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1681
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,180
Thank you.

1682
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,380
Fun fact, there's a Marvel villain that could cure cancer.

1683
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,920
His name is Sora and all he wants to do is...

1684
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,220
Oh yeah, I remember that!

1685
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,760
Wait, that's one of my favorite...

1686
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,900
One of my favorite comic panels.

1687
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:32,900
I don't think I saw this.

1688
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,160
Sorry, I know we're playing Sand Land, but...

1689
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,960
I know that comic panel.

1690
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
It's one of my favorites.

1691
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,520
Because he's like apparently really smart.

1692
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,960
And then Peter... I think it was Peter that...

1693
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,700
And he was like, why don't you use your powers to cure cancer?

1694
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,360
And he's just like, cause dinosaurs are cool.

1695
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,940
I love that panel so much.

1696
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,520
It's so fucking dumb.

1697
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,360
It's like, I don't want to cure cancer.

1698
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,080
I want to turn people into dinosaurs.

1699
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,920
There you guys.

1700
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,240
Here's the panel.

1701
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,080
It's actually... You know what?

1702
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,980
I can actually show this on stream.

1703
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,000
It's actually one of my favorite...

1704
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,940
Dumb panels of all time.

1705
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,520
Comics just go fucking...

1706
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,640
Crazy for no reason.

1707
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:27,600
Here.

1708
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,240
Wait.

1709
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:28,840
Oh my gosh.

1710
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,580
Shh!

1711
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,960
I'm doing something more important right now.

1712
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:36,880
Alright.

1713
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,440
Here.

1714
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,760
This man know what he wants!

1715
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:47,980
DNA.

1716
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,240
We liberated from the grave desecration.

1717
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,480
You call that museum?

1718
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,580
I have perfected the sortinization process.

1719
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,980
You rice paper puppets will be giving force benefiting Earth's dominant species.

1720
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:06,100
You can rewrite DNA on the fly and you're using it to turn people into dinosaurs.

1721
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:09,600
But with tech like that you could cure cancer.

1722
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,480
But I don't want to cure cancer.

1723
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,680
I want to turn people into dinosaurs.بل

1724
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:25,900
This is literally one of my favorite comic pals because it's so fucking stupid.

1725
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,040
He knows what he wants!

1726
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,300
This dinosaur knows what he wants!

1727
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,340
Alright, time to actually play the game again.

1728
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,160
Sorry, we really need to fucking make it to forest land guys.

1729
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,660
I don't know if I can do another day being in sand land.

1730
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,800
Let this man cook!

1731
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,760
Being a dinosaur is just cool there guys.

1732
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,120
You just don't understand.

1733
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,920
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1734
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,300
Thank you.

1735
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,040
Peter recently lost MJ to a child of one of his villains named Paul.

1736
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,920
Buried one of his villains alive, put a black suit back on and became the Green Goblin for 3 issue.

1737
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,020
And lost to MJ in a fight.

1738
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1739
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:17,780
Thank you.

1740
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,820
Comic goes fucking weird sometimes.

1741
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,540
Because they always have to... What is that?

1742
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,560
Oh shit!

1743
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,200
That's a big tiger!

1744
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,520
Okay, I might need these hither materials for like...

1745
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,100
Oh my god!

1746
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,700
New animal!

1747
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,740
New invasive species!

1748
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:44,460
Technically they are all invasive species to me because demons were here first.

1749
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:44,500
Technically they are all invasive species to me because demons were here first.

1750
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:45,880
Yay!

1751
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,120
Okay, we got a panther fang.

1752
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,160
Okay.

1753
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,660
There we go.

1754
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,760
They're all invasive species.

1755
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,040
The demons were here first.

1756
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,200
I'm speaking my truth.

1757
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,920
Okay, we gotta go this way.

1758
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,150
Holy shit!

1759
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,230
That's a big city!

1760
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,990
We're gonna hide our aquarium here.

1761
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:21,230
And create the next Attack on Titan scenario.

1762
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:27,820
How?

1763
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:37,260
Oh my god!

1764
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,440
There's so many people!

1765
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,340
Where do I have to go?

1766
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,740
Oh wait, I didn't start the cutscene?

1767
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,780
Oh my god!

1768
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,460
That's dumb!

1769
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,780
I had to go to that marker!

1770
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,820
Okay, how do we get there?

1771
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,340
Oh wait, what's this?

1772
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,860
Oh, I got somebody's diary.

1773
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:02,900
Hell yeah!

1774
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,500
Thoughts are not private anymore.

1775
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,180
Oh!

1776
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,620
Heavy Gatling gun?

1777
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,300
Oh my god, guys!

1778
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,040
I'm so lost!

1779
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,240
Guys, how do I...

1780
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,320
Wait, there's a cat!

1781
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,500
Oh, there's a cat!

1782
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:15,720
Oh, there's a cat!

1783
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,900
There's a cat!

1784
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:19,940
Not so Deadpool!

1785
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,000
Thank you for the super chat!

1786
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:21,340
Thank you!

1787
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,000
Thank you!

1788
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,940
Wait, that's fucked up!

1789
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,980
That's so fucked up!

1790
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,880
Thank you for the super chat!

1791
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:30,320
Thank you!

1792
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:30,920
Thank you!

1793
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,320
He just wants people to be dinosaurs!

1794
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,440
Like, he doesn't care!

1795
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,860
He just wants the world to be dinos!

1796
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,380
We can't pet the cat.

1797
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,140
6 out of 10.

1798
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,620
Because not being able to pet animals removes force.

1799
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,040
4 points.

1800
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,220
How do I get to the other side?

1801
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,880
Jesus Christ, this is a huge city.

1802
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,780
That means more taxes.

1803
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,320
Oh my god, all the taxes.

1804
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,720
Oh my god.

1805
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,200
The fuck do I...

1806
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,360
Am I not supposed to be here?

1807
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:13,640
Like...

1808
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,600
Guys, I don't think I was supposed to be here.

1809
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,440
Okay, I don't think I was supposed to be here.

1810
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,640
Oh, this is the capital?

1811
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,920
I feel like it was supposed to be on the other side.

1812
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:23,800
There's no way.

1813
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:24,940
Yeah.

1814
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,320
I thought... I think this is just a bonus.

1815
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,940
I think like the...

1816
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,240
Oh no, no, it is inside.

1817
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:36,800
Wait, what?

1818
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,180
Or is it not?

1819
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:39,940
No, it's not!

1820
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:40,520
It's outside!

1821
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,440
Alright.

1822
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,280
Okay.

1823
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,640
It said, we're heading to the capital, or required to pass through a military checkpoint.

1824
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,320
Alright.

1825
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,300
Where's the military checkpoint?

1826
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,440
Now this place is huge.

1827
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:04,980
I didn't know there were more cities.

1828
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,500
I thought there were like three.

1829
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,740
My city?

1830
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,340
The...

1831
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,120
The other junkyard city?

1832
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:15,280
See?

1833
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,120
I told you guys, they are is immigration.

1834
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,520
That's a checkpoint guys.

1835
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,600
Guys, that's literally a checkpoint.

1836
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,300
I knew there were passports in this world.

1837
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,780
Guys, do you think I got my visa?

1838
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,780
Guys, I think I have all my paperwork ready and my visa.

1839
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,980
I think I have my visa to go to forest land.

1840
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,060
Whoops.

1841
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,000
That is my visa.

1842
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,800
There we go.

1843
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,460
I got through.

1844
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,700
Is this a bad tank?

1845
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,020
That's a bad tank.

1846
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:57,920
Yeah.

1847
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,260
That's my visa.

1848
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,060
But they're so small!

1849
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,860
They built all that?

1850
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,020
That's actually crazy they're able to build all that.

1851
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,540
They're like half the size of a regular person.

1852
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,100
Oh my god, that's level 33.

1853
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,400
I don't think we can take that on.

1854
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,380
I don't think we can run over that cat.

1855
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,020
How do we get there?

1856
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,280
I hope this is a new dungeon.

1857
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,240
Okay, but how do we get there?

1858
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,440
What the fuck is that door?

1859
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,320
Oh, whoops.

1860
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:38,220
Ow.

1861
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,560
Alright.

1862
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,800
Ugh, no.

1863
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,940
You don't even have a driver's license!

1864
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:48,840
Thief.

1865
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,560
Rock, paper, scissors.

1866
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:52,460
Yay!

1867
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:53,660
I win!

1868
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,300
I don't know if driving and playing rock, paper, scissors is a good idea, Beelzebub.

1869
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,260
Could the forest land army already be there?

1870
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,620
There's no way!

1871
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,020
I had a bike!

1872
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,660
We've got to stay vigilant.

1873
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,840
Alright, here we go.

1874
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,580
This should be it.

1875
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,620
Oh wait, what are you gonna tell me?

1876
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:15,240
Good.

1877
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:16,900
Oh, good.

1878
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:17,740
Hahaha!

1879
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,040
Good!

1880
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,020
Nice!

1881
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,060
Wait, that's not it?

1882
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,620
Is this just another city?

1883
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,680
Holy shit, guys!

1884
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,780
It's like it's a country or something.

1885
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,340
Oh my god!

1886
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,940
Who would have thought this place is so populated?

1887
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:37,840
Good.

1888
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,280
Imagine that.

1889
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,040
It's so wild.

1890
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:49,100
There's actually like different cities, a capital city.

1891
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,760
Like there's more to this world than just three cities.

1892
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,860
Do any humans live around here?

1893
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,920
What do you mean?

1894
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,180
Literally, there's a person right in front of me.

1895
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,540
Hahaha, Beelzebub.

1896
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,140
Is there people here?

1897
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,360
I say as I look at a human face.

1898
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,330
Another battleship that's all busted up inside.

1899
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:21,530
Oh, this one's more busted.

1900
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,330
Looks like the only way inside is down.

1901
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:27,150
It's slippery, so watch your footing.

1902
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:28,770
Okay.

1903
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:29,030
Okay.

1904
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:30,890
I have to go this way.

1905
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,390
Wait, do we have to go this way?

1906
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:33,170
No.

1907
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,070
Yellow!

1908
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,650
I know what to do!

1909
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:42,430
Wait, why is there like tricky jumper?

1910
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:43,090
Oh wait, no.

1911
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,230
That's just a bonus mission.

1912
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:44,730
Okay.

1913
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,330
Can you grab our jumper?

1914
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:48,850
And then we go...

1915
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,590
Alright, nice.

1916
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,610
And then...

1917
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:01,010
Thank God for yellow paint, guys.

1918
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,070
I don't know what I'll do about it.

1919
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,690
Okay, and then we go this way.

1920
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:10,250
And we get off the jumper, but...

1921
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,970
Please, just let...

1922
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:14,510
Please, all I want to do is go to sportsnet.

1923
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:16,550
We've been stuck in sad...

1924
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:22,510
Oh yeah, by the way, I was curious on like how much more I had of this game.

1925
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:26,010
And like, to get to my part.

1926
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:28,730
So like, you know, okay, I tell you guys, like, I would try to see...

1927
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:29,010
I would try to see if I can get to the end of this game.

1928
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,150
And like, gauge how much I have left of a video game sometimes.

1929
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:33,830
I feel like, whoa, I've been playing this game for a long time.

1930
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,210
Maybe I'm getting closer to the ending.

1931
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,870
And, um...

1932
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:39,990
So like, I went and googled, you know, YouTube, like...

1933
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:40,690
Uh...

1934
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,250
No commentary playthrough, sad land.

1935
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:46,670
And I stopped at the part where I'm supposed to be at.

1936
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,470
Where I'm at.

1937
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:49,750
From part three.

1938
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,390
And I looked at it.

1939
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:53,170
And then like, from them...

1940
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,610
It literally took that guy, like...

1941
01:23:58,130 --> 01:23:58,990
Four hours.

1942
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,890
Four hours to five hours.

1943
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:05,690
To get to the part where I ended last time.

1944
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,830
And like, you know...

1945
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,290
I played like...

1946
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:10,770
Maybe like...

1947
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:13,470
Sixteen hours of this game already?

1948
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:19,330
Maybe...

1949
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,570
Okay, maybe not sixteen.

1950
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,370
Maybe like...

1951
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:23,310
Twelve hours of this game.

1952
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:24,170
If I'm like...

1953
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,350
And it took the...

1954
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:28,970
Yeah...

1955
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:28,990
I don't know.

1956
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,110
It took the guy with the silent...

1957
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:33,270
Like, no commentary...

1958
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:34,090
Uh...

1959
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:37,050
No commentary...

1960
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,590
playthrough...

1961
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:39,690
It took him like...

1962
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:42,250
Four to five hours to get to where I was.

1963
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,430
And I was like...

1964
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:48,750
Okay, how much more...

1965
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,550
left of the game for him?

1966
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:52,730
And then I looked at it...

1967
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:54,070
To see like, alright...

1968
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:56,610
How long till it takes to the ending?

1969
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:58,850
And then I looked at it...

1970
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,290
And it was like...

1971
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,230
Oh, I don't know.

1972
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,290
It was like...

1973
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:04,770
Maybe like...

1974
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,850
Ten to twelve hours...

1975
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,130
left of the game...

1976
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:09,110
Of the video?

1977
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,490
So I'm just like...

1978
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:14,450
Oh, if there's ten to twelve...

1979
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:17,210
If there's ten to twelve hours...

1980
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,090
left from the video...

1981
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,330
for him...

1982
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,170
Oh, this is gonna be...

1983
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:24,170
I don't know how long...

1984
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:25,590
we're gonna be stuck here.

1985
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:31,390
This might be like...

1986
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:33,070
my longest playthrough...

1987
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:33,390
yet.

1988
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,210
I'm not gonna lie.

1989
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,370
Holy shit...

1990
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:39,070
We're stuck in...

1991
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,470
Sandland forever.

1992
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:44,710
Just like...

1993
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:46,670
a couple more years of Sandland.

1994
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:49,350
But I'm having fun.

1995
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:51,290
I've been enjoying the story so far.

1996
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,490
This is why...

1997
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:54,890
But yeah, this is like...

1998
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:57,010
the rare moment where I play RPGs.

1999
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:00,770
But yeah...

2000
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:02,550
I should expect that because...

2001
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,810
it is an RPG.

2002
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:06,070
And RPG does like...

2003
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:09,070
RPGs are...

2004
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,170
known to take a long time.

2005
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:12,970
But yeah...

2006
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:13,570
This is why...

2007
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:17,110
This is like my first venture into a JRPG game.

2008
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:17,950
To...

2009
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:19,970
Should I go this way?

2010
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:21,210
Door open!

2011
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,080
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

2012
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:29,800
Thank you, thank you.

2013
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:32,580
Yeah, but this guy has 50 chairs in a room.

2014
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,840
I think not.

2015
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,500
True, Marshall.

2016
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:35,960
True.

2017
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,820
The floor looks fragile.

2018
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,780
Yeah, this is supposed to be...

2019
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,120
a short RPG too.

2020
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,920
Maybe we can crash through on landing.

2021
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:45,960
Alright.

2022
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:46,760
Wee!

2023
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,180
Okay, wait.

2024
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,000
How do I...

2025
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:49,640
Oh, it's X.

2026
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:50,640
Okay, I was gonna say...

2027
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,520
How do I collapse this?

2028
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,160
I already forgot how.

2029
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,200
Is there extra loot here?

2030
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,160
No.

2031
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:58,600
Okay.

2032
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,400
Wait, but there's an extra...

2033
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,080
hole here.

2034
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:02,620
Or there's an...

2035
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,160
extra hole.

2036
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:03,660
There's loot.

2037
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,580
Where's the... Oh, there it is.

2038
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,580
Okay, give me that loot.

2039
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,120
Nice!

2040
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,580
I love loot.

2041
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,720
Wait, I need to kill you...

2042
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:15,240
for loot too!

2043
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:16,820
Get over here.

2044
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,420
Get over here.

2045
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:18,780
Yes!

2046
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,780
I need your claws!

2047
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,300
I need to upgrade my...

2048
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,600
my bots.

2049
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,700
Let's see...

2050
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,740
Alright, we go this way.

2051
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:31,800
That's a dead bullet!

2052
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,640
Thank you for the super chat!

2053
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:32,920
Thank you!

2054
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,180
Hour of gameplay to two hours of yapping checks out to the Doki stream experience.

2055
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,040
Wouldn't have it any other way!

2056
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,600
Thank you for the super chat!

2057
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:42,980
Thank you!

2058
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:48,360
I'm happy to the people who have stuck it out to like the four parts already.

2059
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:52,860
Cause like, this is also why I tend to avoid like longer games.

2060
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:58,820
Because I know like, you know, the longer the game series, the less people will watch it.

2061
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,400
Just cause it, you know, people are like oooh, it's a lot of time investment to it.

2062
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:05,760
So I really appreciate the dragoons that have like, uh...

2063
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:07,060
stuck out.

2064
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,460
Cause we have a long way to go.

2065
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,400
We're not even at Forest Land.

2066
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,360
Also, hey Gerard!

2067
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,000
Oh yeah!

2068
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:18,240
Yeah, this game is very cute!

2069
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,880
It's actually been pretty enjoyable so far.

2070
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,380
But it is a JRPG though, so...

2071
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,340
It's a long series.

2072
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,040
Get outta here.

2073
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,920
Oh my god, wait, this is just an innocent bystander.

2074
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,720
Oh well.

2075
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:42,500
There's no innocent bystander in the land of Sandland.

2076
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,860
This is a lawless land.

2077
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,940
What's yours is mine.

2078
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,180
Hey guys, I'm just gonna walk past you guys.

2079
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:55,140
Oh wait, except for you.

2080
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:55,920
You have a bazooka.

2081
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,180
Oh hey!

2082
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:58,720
Alright.

2083
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,360
Where do I go?

2084
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,120
Do I go this way?

2085
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,040
Or do I go this way?

2086
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,800
Rated out of 10?

2087
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,300
I think the story...

2088
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,020
I don't really normally play JRPG, but this is like it.

2089
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,720
Oh, that guy is definitely dead.

2090
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:14,560
Oh god!

2091
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,180
I'm gonna give it like...

2092
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,300
7 or an 8.

2093
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,540
I don't normally play JRPGs, but like, I've been enjoying this JRPG.

2094
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,340
There are some dungeons that are a bit repetitive though.

2095
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,260
Let's see.

2096
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,420
And you can drive a tank, see?

2097
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,520
Boom.

2098
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,340
I have a tank.

2099
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:43,390
Uh...

2100
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:44,470
Alright, which way do I go?

2101
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,430
Wait, where's the... Oh my god!

2102
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:48,990
If we didn't have... Ryo!

2103
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:49,470
Please!

2104
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,310
Close your hatch!

2105
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:53,810
It's literally the door!

2106
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:56,210
It's literally that fucking door!

2107
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:58,030
That's why I can't go through!

2108
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:03,790
Alright, we gotta use the jump butt.

2109
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,870
Alright.

2110
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:15,370
Also, if you're directionally challenged, you get the yellow boxes.

2111
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,290
Which is great because...

2112
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:20,730
Because I'm very directionally challenged, Gerard.

2113
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:23,410
So I very appreciate the yellow paint.

2114
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,190
Alright.

2115
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:28,150
Goodbye, guys.

2116
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:32,970
Like, you don't have to commit murder, but if you want to, you can.

2117
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,070
Like this.

2118
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:37,570
Oh, wait, there's loot!

2119
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:39,030
I gotta commit a murder.

2120
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:40,630
There's free loot.

2121
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:45,550
Uh...

2122
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,870
Ruze, thank you for the super chat!

2123
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:47,830
Thank you, thank you!

2124
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:52,070
I avoid JRPG streams like a plague, but for Doki, I will always show up.

2125
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:52,850
Thank you for the super chat!

2126
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:53,890
Thank you, thank you!

2127
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,190
And thank you for showing up!

2128
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,750
I really appreciate it.

2129
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:00,330
And I know, like, JRPG is not, like, a thing for everybody.

2130
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:05,670
Especially, like, since I'm known more so for, like, you know, FPS games.

2131
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:07,630
And not JRPG... OH MY GOD!

2132
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:08,450
They jumped away!

2133
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,150
That's illegal!

2134
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:12,330
Okay, get outta here.

2135
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,550
Get outta here.

2136
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:18,430
Alright.

2137
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:22,770
Let's see...

2138
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:24,350
Go this way.

2139
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:25,670
There has to be loot here.

2140
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,570
Because it's not part of the map.

2141
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:31,670
The yellow... the yellow paint didn't tell me to go this way.

2142
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:33,650
So there has to be loot.

2143
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,050
Then the rules...

2144
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:36,450
Wait!

2145
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:37,090
Yellow paint!

2146
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,070
Yellow paint!

2147
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:41,610
There's so much yellow paint!

2148
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,030
Where does it lead?

2149
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:47,930
Where does the yellow paint lead?

2150
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:49,790
Okay.

2151
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:53,410
Weeeeee!

2152
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:55,850
Alright.

2153
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:57,590
Wait, how the fuck do I...

2154
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,370
Where am I going?

2155
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,430
This better be, like, some insane loot.

2156
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,610
It's like, we're EMBA!

2157
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:06,630
Okay, can I... can I...

2158
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:08,510
destroy this with this?

2159
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:09,570
No, I have to use the tank.

2160
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:10,330
Nope!

2161
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:11,350
Oh no!

2162
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:14,370
Okay.

2163
01:32:14,370 --> 01:32:15,170
Oh no.

2164
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:17,010
Oh wait, it works!

2165
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,370
Nice!

2166
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:17,890
Alright.

2167
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,270
This works.

2168
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,010
So I'll destroy that.

2169
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:22,170
Wait, no!

2170
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:25,230
I have to be up top.

2171
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,210
Oop!

2172
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,430
Alright.

2173
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,250
Oh yeah!

2174
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:34,490
Nice!

2175
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:34,830
Loot!

2176
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,050
Loot!

2177
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,610
Yay!

2178
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,570
I get to upgrade my tank!

2179
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,410
Then we got this out of the way.

2180
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,130
Wait, how do I get across from here?

2181
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:48,090
What?

2182
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:50,010
It's from there?

2183
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,350
Oh no, I have to use my brain.

2184
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:54,890
Can't believe it.

2185
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:57,230
The yellow paint isn't holding my hand anymore.

2186
01:32:58,690 --> 01:32:59,850
What does this do?

2187
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,790
Oh wait, no!

2188
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:01,430
I can...

2189
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:03,510
jump from here?

2190
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:06,430
No!

2191
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:07,210
No!

2192
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:09,530
Wait, maybe from here?

2193
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:11,330
No, that's where I came from.

2194
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:12,250
Oh!

2195
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:15,490
It lets me like go back!

2196
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:18,730
That's what it was for.

2197
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:19,830
Was that it?

2198
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:23,310
Is that all the loot?

2199
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,270
Wait, that has to be.

2200
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:28,330
Alright, got my loot.

2201
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:29,670
Now off I go.

2202
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:33,230
The bike is faster.

2203
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:34,730
Yay!

2204
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,930
Bye bye!

2205
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,390
Is this way?

2206
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,890
Yeah, it's this way.

2207
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,560
Please.

2208
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,120
No!

2209
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:50,580
Please!

2210
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,140
Oh my god, it's like parallel parking!

2211
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,500
I felt like I was parallel parking just then!

2212
01:33:58,980 --> 01:33:59,540
Okay.

2213
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,600
Yay, we made it!

2214
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,140
Okay, get the jump bot.

2215
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:05,660
Not a good place to call it?

2216
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,980
Is it cause I... oh, I was too close to the...

2217
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,560
too close to the square.

2218
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,000
Alright, off we go.

2219
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,080
Back to the objective.

2220
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,060
Down we go.

2221
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:22,540
And...

2222
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,360
this way.

2223
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,920
The driver's license!

2224
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,760
Alright, nice!

2225
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,800
Alright, it's time to kill the other jump bots.

2226
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,580
Alright, no, this is too baby.

2227
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,880
I gotta bring in the big boys.

2228
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,280
Sorry, I forgot to reload.

2229
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,740
That is an issue that has never left me.

2230
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,440
That's right, I'm bringing the big guns.

2231
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,180
You think you can jump away from your problems?

2232
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,800
I can run you over!

2233
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,180
I have a tank!

2234
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,420
Oh shit, baby.

2235
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,340
Okay.

2236
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,540
Level 13, please.

2237
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,640
Who let this child into this fight?

2238
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:07,800
Alright, I think that's everybody.

2239
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,360
Yay!

2240
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:18,820
I can't wait to get to forest land cause like I'm really sad that this dungeon is basically like the last...

2241
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:23,480
You know the last dungeon we had where we were in the battleship?

2242
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:29,620
We're back in the... it's like, it's just the same battleship but there's more sand.

2243
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:32,660
Please.

2244
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,600
Why you gotta do this to me?

2245
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:40,180
Why did you bring me back to the... to the... this fucking dungeon?

2246
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,160
Okay.

2247
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,640
Loot time!

2248
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:46,540
Okay.

2249
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,400
Woo!

2250
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:51,460
I mean it's another...

2251
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:53,480
It's literally the same battleship!

2252
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,560
It's made by the same general of that battleship!

2253
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,700
Oh my gosh, I keep...

2254
01:35:59,480 --> 01:35:59,980
You know what?

2255
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:00,880
I'm gonna... Ryle.

2256
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:02,700
Do it.

2257
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:03,220
Do the thing.

2258
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:05,480
Do the thing.

2259
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:05,920
Shoot him.

2260
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,280
Shoot him, Ryle!

2261
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,120
Ryle, please!

2262
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,040
Shoot your gun!

2263
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,640
Shoot your gun one time!

2264
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,420
That's all I ask, Ryle.

2265
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,060
Shoot it!

2266
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:16,800
Shoot it!

2267
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:18,040
Shoot it!

2268
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,920
Oh my god, I swear to god.

2269
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:21,800
I...

2270
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:27,340
I swear to fucking god, Ryle.

2271
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,360
It took him 80 years and that was the damage he did.

2272
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:36,340
Alright.

2273
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,520
Woo!

2274
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,500
Yeah, the only issue... I think the only reason why...

2275
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:50,260
I feel like this game definitely deserves a bit more popularity.

2276
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:57,080
But like, it was just very unfortunate that it was released around the same time as Stellar Blade.

2277
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,680
Because all the streamers were playing Stellar Blade instead of this.

2278
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,920
I feel like... I feel like it like if they didn't overlap...

2279
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,820
If they didn't overlap with Stellar Blade release, I feel like this game would have been more popular.

2280
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,980
Because it is... it is interesting.

2281
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,260
I do like it.

2282
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,220
Yay!

2283
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,720
Yeah, and everybody wanted to play Waifu Dark Souls.

2284
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,880
Which I don't blame them!

2285
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:29,640
I mean, it's literally Waifu Dark Souls.

2286
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:31,680
So... mistakes!

2287
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:32,640
Thank you for the super chat!

2288
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:33,580
Thank you, thank you!

2289
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,780
RPGs are pretty...

2290
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,480
are pretty dull to watch.

2291
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,380
But you saying and laughing about Quenium makes it worth it.

2292
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,080
I like the story of this game so far.

2293
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,380
It's been pretty interesting.

2294
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,960
Am I going the right way?

2295
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:53,440
Yeah, I am.

2296
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,300
Oh my god!

2297
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,100
I've been recently watching The Boys.

2298
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:59,500
No spoiler, but like... oh my god.

2299
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,120
I... this is the Eric Kripke curse.

2300
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,640
I don't know if you guys know who Eric Kripke is.

2301
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:05,120
But like...

2302
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,440
he wrote Supernatural.

2303
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:14,980
And like... if you never watched Supernatural, it was really good in the beginning, but the more seasons it gets, the...

2304
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,600
the worse it gets.

2305
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,320
Because it's like...

2306
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,740
Eric Kripke... he's...

2307
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,460
It's like...

2308
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,180
what's his name?

2309
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:31,260
It's like that...

2310
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,020
the creed... oh, what's his name?

2311
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:33,640
Ryan Murray.

2312
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,500
I don't know if you guys know the writer, Ryan Murphy.

2313
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,780
But it's similar to like...

2314
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:40,600
Ryan Murphy and like his series.

2315
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,380
He wrote like Glee, Rip and Tuck...

2316
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,640
Nip and Tuck or something.

2317
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:45,900
Like the surgery one.

2318
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,660
And like...

2319
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:51,800
So like him and Ryan Murphy, they both have like...

2320
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:58,260
the big weakness where they have a really, really good premise and beginning seasons.

2321
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:02,560
The first like one to two... one to three seasons is like really good.

2322
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,720
And then it's like...

2323
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,600
you know, it starts getting...

2324
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,400
not great.

2325
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:15,460
Yeah, I know he left in season five, but even then like the show was starting to get...

2326
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:19,480
like... even before season five the show was starting to get like...

2327
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,060
you know...

2328
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:23,240
Yeah...

2329
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,740
Oh no...

2330
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:27,220
Oh no, please...

2331
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,640
No, it's the self-destruct ones.

2332
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,680
Oh no, it's 2D time.

2333
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:39,460
But yeah, I checked out the new season of The Boys cause there's a couple of...

2334
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:43,260
I honestly thought season three of The Boys was like pretty rough.

2335
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:46,560
I wasn't really a big fan of season three of The Boys.

2336
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:49,720
Because like I felt like the story...

2337
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,680
Please get away from me.

2338
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,800
I'm trying to talk about The Boys.

2339
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:54,700
Oh, it does nothing.

2340
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:55,140
Okay.

2341
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,380
A little bit of explosion doesn't hurt me.

2342
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:01,320
But like yeah, it was...

2343
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,680
How do I say?

2344
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:06,200
Like season three of The Boys started fizzling out for me.

2345
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,620
Because there was like a pattern to it.

2346
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:15,360
Which was each episode has either sex or gore.

2347
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:19,460
And like it was literally like... it was so much of it.

2348
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,760
It was like inserted there for no reason.

2349
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,200
That was season three for me.

2350
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:25,640
Season... I was like season four?

2351
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,500
I couldn't believe it.

2352
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,180
But they inserted more.

2353
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:38,780
Like I feel like I watched the first three episodes of season four of The Boys.

2354
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,780
And...

2355
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:48,980
And like I swear every scene had to at least have one like freaky sex scene.

2356
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:52,480
Or like one really particularly gory moment.

2357
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:54,240
Or sex and gore.

2358
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,720
Yeah, and like but the thing is it's there for no reason.

2359
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,760
Like they added there for like no reason.

2360
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:05,480
I was gonna say season three it started off okay.

2361
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,420
But then it started getting like the plot and everything started getting weird.

2362
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,280
To be fair, the comics are worse.

2363
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,600
The comics are not great.

2364
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,940
I read the comics of The Boys.

2365
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:27,820
And like if you guys never um... if you guys never read the comics, The Boys was written by a writer who just really hated superheroes.

2366
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,360
Like he fucking hated the superhero genre.

2367
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,840
And the comic was like really bad.

2368
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,440
Like I read it.

2369
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,120
I don't know.

2370
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,540
Like maybe somebody actually liked the comics.

2371
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,920
But it was just... it was written...

2372
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:46,640
They added shock factor for the sake of shock factor.

2373
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,420
Not for the sake of the story.

2374
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,020
And so like...

2375
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:55,700
So like I... you know.

2376
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,040
But then like the thing is like...

2377
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:02,120
At least The Boys they had some really... the show had some funny moments here.

2378
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,000
But like I... I...

2379
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,440
I swear I only laughed like once.

2380
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,540
For the first three...

2381
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,420
The three episodes for season four.

2382
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,820
I laughed only like one time.

2383
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:19,490
It was just... I don't know.

2384
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:20,410
It was just not funny.

2385
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:24,510
It was just... the first three episodes just not funny.

2386
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:28,130
It was just... it was just...

2387
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,020
It was just...

2388
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:35,020
the first three episodes just not funny.

2389
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:35,140
I don't know.

2390
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,640
Also like...

2391
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,240
Homelander's kid...

2392
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,500
I swear to god.

2393
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:40,800
Not a spoiler thing.

2394
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,100
But they made him a fucking squeaker.

2395
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,580
For no reason.

2396
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:47,160
I swear.

2397
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:48,600
I swear to god.

2398
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:51,760
I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually sound like that.

2399
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:54,920
He's clearly going through puberty right now.

2400
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:56,980
But like... I swear Okay.

2401
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,300
I'll describe a scene that's not a spoiler.

2402
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:00,860
But there's a scene...

2403
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:07,940
And there's the scene in there where Homelander's kid plays a ripoff of Mortal Kombat.

2404
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,600
No, but like...

2405
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:17,880
He plays a parody of Mortal Kombat.

2406
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:26,700
And then he talks on mic for it, and he exaggerated it!

2407
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:30,420
I swear he made himself even squeakier.

2408
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,660
I couldn't believe it.

2409
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,820
Because they are parodying squeakers on gaming.

2410
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,860
So they made him feel like his voice cracks the entire time.

2411
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,900
And I'm like, I swear you used to be able to talk.

2412
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:43,600
Like what...

2413
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,180
I couldn't believe...

2414
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,860
Oh my god.

2415
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:58,340
It was actually insane.

2416
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,940
Like it was just a parody of squeakers when he was talking in game.

2417
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:08,760
Because like after he finished playing, he didn't sound like that anymore.

2418
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,340
I was like, what the fuck?

2419
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,380
Zonderman, thank you for the super chat.

2420
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,120
Thank you, thank you.

2421
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:15,880
You not laughing?

2422
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:16,660
How could it be?

2423
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,040
Not my...

2424
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:18,680
Oh shit.

2425
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:23,120
Look, if you saw the first three episodes of The Boys, you would understand.

2426
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,680
But I hope it changes.

2427
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,960
I hope it changes because it's honestly...

2428
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:40,580
I'm a bit sad that the first three episodes is like really meh.

2429
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,140
Oh my god, what are they doing here?

2430
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:50,260
Alright, any day now, are you guys gonna make it?

2431
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,420
The Sandman's are back!

2432
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,130
What are you up to?

2433
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,320
You were eavesdropping, weren't you?

2434
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,120
Yeah.

2435
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:09,380
You were fixing to go and get your hands on the Aquanium first, weren't you?

2436
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,180
Yeah, they're doing the Baywatch.

2437
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,580
Well, yeah, but I mean, not anymore.

2438
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,620
But what are they doing here then?

2439
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,700
No one told us it was being guarded by that.

2440
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:23,200
By what?

2441
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,560
Tough talk for a bunch of cowards.

2442
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,420
What's that?

2443
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,480
Never mind them.

2444
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,740
Let's worry about ourselves.

2445
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:31,280
What's that?

2446
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,340
The Swimmers!

2447
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,460
What is that?

2448
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:35,960
Explain!

2449
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:39,060
It sounds like there's something up ahead that even the Swimmers couldn't handle.

2450
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:43,740
I don't know.

2451
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,100
But yeah, I don't know.

2452
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,780
I hope the newer episodes of The Boys...

2453
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,460
Because I actually was really looking forward to it.

2454
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,420
Really looking forward to it.

2455
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:51,720
And like...

2456
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:52,600
Oh my god!

2457
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:54,280
Okay, like...

2458
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:54,940
There was like...

2459
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:55,940
There's so many...

2460
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,380
And then they like...

2461
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,800
They introduced a lot of new characters all of a sudden in the new season.

2462
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,700
And then like...

2463
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:03,500
And I'm like, who the fuck are these people?

2464
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,520
There's like two characters in the new season that...

2465
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,940
It's like they try to pretend that they've always been there.

2466
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:13,900
And everything.

2467
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,280
And I was like, wait, I don't remember these people.

2468
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,480
More than they could chew.

2469
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,100
Alright, time to get the big boys in.

2470
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,280
Right on!

2471
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:26,940
Do your thing!

2472
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:28,080
Oh god.

2473
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,120
Wait, have we fought?

2474
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:29,840
I thought...

2475
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,820
Not so invulnerable anymore!

2476
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:31,920
Wait a minute.

2477
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:32,940
Why?

2478
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:34,020
Guys.

2479
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:34,800
What do...

2480
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,440
I do...

2481
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,440
Guys, I think I should have leveled up, guys.

2482
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,140
I think...

2483
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:45,420
I think I might have like fucked up by not leveling up.

2484
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:48,160
This is gonna take a while.

2485
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:50,460
Not so invulnerable anymore!

2486
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,280
This might take a while.

2487
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:58,740
I don't know...

2488
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,480
There is a...

2489
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,520
No!

2490
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,860
Oh wait, I can just...

2491
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,440
Wait, what if I just don't...

2492
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:09,940
head there?

2493
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:12,400
I'll just stand in the center.

2494
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,980
It's not like they can hit me, right?

2495
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:15,920
Oh my god.

2496
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:17,880
This is actually gonna take forever.

2497
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,700
I messed up a little bit.

2498
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,300
Okay, nice.

2499
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,760
Oh my god, this is gonna take forever guys!

2500
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,760
Oh no, not you too!

2501
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:40,280
Okay, we gotta get rid of the little turrets.

2502
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,100
Rival, come back!

2503
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:47,040
Rival, please!

2504
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,120
I'm only halfway!

2505
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,900
I'm not leading my shots anymore.

2506
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,460
Oh, this sucks!

2507
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:56,760
The sticky one sucks!

2508
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:58,920
Okay.

2509
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,820
Alright, here we go.

2510
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,360
I need to get rid of these guys.

2511
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:05,300
It's fine, I have so many repair kits because I don't heal.

2512
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,080
It's fine.

2513
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,000
Oh no.

2514
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,680
Oh, that's not fine!

2515
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:14,060
It's okay, if I stand here, he can't get me.

2516
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,580
I'll just stand here.

2517
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:15,800
Oh!

2518
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,280
It's okay, if I stand here, he can't get me.

2519
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,420
We're halfway through!

2520
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:24,060
We're almost there!

2521
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,600
Okay.

2522
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,120
Wait, electric?

2523
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,420
Guys, I can't!

2524
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,440
No!

2525
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,000
No!

2526
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:42,580
I'm trying!

2527
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:45,440
This is not fair!

2528
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,880
My tank can't jump!

2529
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,320
That's not fair!

2530
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:53,920
My tank can't jump!

2531
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,460
Oh, guys!

2532
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:55,940
Guys!

2533
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:57,500
Guys!

2534
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:57,960
Guys!

2535
01:48:58,540 --> 01:48:59,000
Guys!

2536
01:48:59,100 --> 01:48:59,340
Okay!

2537
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,300
Where's the heal?

2538
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:01,980
Oh, thank god!

2539
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:02,760
Okay, repair kit.

2540
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,220
Yay!

2541
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:06,540
Oh wait, firepower.

2542
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,520
Okay, guys, we're gonna use everything.

2543
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:09,700
Alright.

2544
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,300
There we go.

2545
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,140
There we go, guys.

2546
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,120
See, nothing bad is gonna happen to me.

2547
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,320
See, like that!

2548
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,820
And I boosted up the firepower!

2549
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,500
Okay, nice.

2550
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:25,660
I should have done that in the beginning.

2551
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:27,100
I have so many powerups.

2552
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:29,480
The tank can't jump, guys!

2553
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:30,920
What do you mean, jump?

2554
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,380
This tank wasn't made to jump!

2555
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:39,820
Oh, god.

2556
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,660
Oh, this is bad.

2557
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,360
Oh, this is bad.

2558
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:44,320
Okay.

2559
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,880
We have another repair kit.

2560
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:47,220
And then we're gonna use another one.

2561
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,220
And then we're gonna use another defense.

2562
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,260
We're so close.

2563
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:50,820
It's so close.

2564
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,300
It's so close.

2565
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:51,800
Oh, this is bad.

2566
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,700
Okay, nice.

2567
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:55,300
Oh, don't worry, I can take this!

2568
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,280
I can take this!

2569
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:58,540
Goodbye!

2570
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,660
He's only two hits!

2571
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:02,420
No, I'm missing!

2572
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,500
I'm missing!

2573
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:06,180
He's literally in front of me!

2574
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,780
Okay, there we go.

2575
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,040
Easy.

2576
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,460
So easy.

2577
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,760
It only took all my upgrades that I've stocked up until now.

2578
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,180
Yeah!

2579
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,200
I thought you ran off.

2580
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:30,720
My gut told me to come back and guard the aquarium from bats.

2581
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:31,620
Oh, no, not you.

2582
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:33,320
Not you too.

2583
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:33,940
Yeah, right.

2584
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,660
You just wanted to grab it for yourself.

2585
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,220
You think we're just gonna let that slide?

2586
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:40,920
No!

2587
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:41,980
Listen!

2588
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,440
It's true.

2589
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,620
I do want to protect it!

2590
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,860
Well, we were planning on selling it to that armed group at first.

2591
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:51,520
Selling it?

2592
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:52,820
Shut it, Slee!

2593
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:54,780
They don't need to know that!

2594
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:59,820
I mean, I knew it would fetch a fine price if I sold it.

2595
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,780
What do you need the money for?

2596
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:02,920
You can finally swim!

2597
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:08,820
When I realized someone could use it for something as awful as that disaster 30 years ago.

2598
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:13,760
Besides, I have a few contacts in the forest land resistance.

2599
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:15,140
Hmm.

2600
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,040
You don't need to be like rebels anymore.

2601
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:20,880
I am!

2602
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:21,780
You can leave.

2603
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:22,860
I can literally swim now!

2604
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,620
So do you want us to gain entry to forest land?

2605
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,780
That I can't do.

2606
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:31,660
Joining forces with you would be collaborating with the Royal Army.

2607
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,540
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

2608
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,260
I'd never be able to face my friends in the rebel army again.

2609
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,140
That's understandable.

2610
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:45,560
If it's any consolation, you can have this.

2611
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,580
It's the core frame for a hoverbot.

2612
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,760
Are you sure, Papa?

2613
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:51,600
A hoverbot?

2614
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:51,780
I'm not sure.

2615
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,000
We're the swimmers.

2616
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,400
We don't need a bot for crossing water!

2617
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,960
Oh, I have a robot for water?

2618
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,680
Wait, I'm trying to...

2619
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,600
What the fuck is this game's writing?

2620
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,480
Well, I doubt we'll meet again anyway.

2621
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:14,020
I'm using a water bot to like go to forest land.

2622
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:16,920
Illegally.

2623
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:19,980
Now then, let's get to searching for that aquarium.

2624
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:21,140
A robot is on the water.

2625
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:21,160
I can't get the robot in the water.

2626
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:24,080
Like, who wrote...

2627
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,400
Alright, let's level up.

2628
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,960
Oh, I need two.

2629
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,180
Okay, I don't have enough yet.

2630
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,320
Uh, pow pow.

2631
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,420
A creature with your pow pow?

2632
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,360
What the fuck is pow pow?

2633
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,960
Timber increases the attack of... oh, wait, I like that.

2634
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,220
Increases the attack of my... of my thing.

2635
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,260
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

2636
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,440
Thank you, thank you.

2637
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:52,240
I wonder if I can rock the swimmer's outfit.

2638
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:52,760
Do it!

2639
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,340
Do it at a convention!

2640
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:57,980
Alright.

2641
01:52:58,360 --> 01:52:59,620
Goodbye, I don't need you guys.

2642
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,160
I don't need you guys.

2643
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:11,310
Alright, here we go.

2644
01:53:11,950 --> 01:53:13,690
I gotta make my new bot.

2645
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:15,090
Wait, where... is this Aquanium?

2646
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:16,950
Knock knock!

2647
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:18,190
Aquanium!

2648
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,120
Drop it!

2649
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:31,100
Let a child...

2650
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:34,640
Yeah, let a child hold on to it.

2651
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,940
Ugh, all two of them.

2652
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:47,600
It looks like we're gonna have to make it past the border first.

2653
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,500
Anne would know how to do it.

2654
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:53,540
She snuck across the border before, after all.

2655
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:54,880
Guys, come on!

2656
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:56,700
Let's just get passports and visas!

2657
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:57,560
Guys!

2658
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,760
Let's get back to Spino.

2659
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,200
Alright, we gotta go back.

2660
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,620
Wait, can I just... oh, I have to get out from here.

2661
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,820
Guys, we literally have connection to the king!

2662
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:16,560
We don't have to illegally go to forest land, guys!

2663
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:16,680
Guys, we literally have connection to the king!

2664
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:16,680
We don't have to illegally go to forest land, guys!

2665
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:19,000
We have connections with the king now!

2666
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:23,840
How do I get out of here?

2667
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:25,180
Oh, this way.

2668
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,200
Right here.

2669
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:30,140
Guys, I can't believe it, guys.

2670
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,240
Oh my god, finally!

2671
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:36,340
Guys, we're gonna make it to forest land!

2672
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:37,320
I told you!

2673
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:40,540
I told you it's not clickbait!

2674
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:45,180
We're finally gonna make it!

2675
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:49,740
Oh, I forgot to... I forgot to skip the cutscene for that.

2676
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:51,420
This is it.

2677
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:53,820
We're gonna see what it looks like.

2678
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:57,620
Yay!

2679
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:59,140
How do I get there faster?

2680
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:01,420
This way?

2681
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:03,720
Which way is the exit?

2682
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:05,860
Oh, this way.

2683
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,520
I feel like I missed the shortcut.

2684
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,780
Unless it wants me to go the long way.

2685
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,220
Oh, wait, what?

2686
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:17,600
This way?

2687
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:25,310
I'm surprised that... Oh, I guess we make our own shortcut.

2688
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:27,930
We make our own shortcut.

2689
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:30,170
We don't need them to tell us where to go.

2690
01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:32,870
I say as I follow the checkpoint.

2691
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:35,670
How do I get out of here?

2692
01:55:36,970 --> 01:55:38,170
How do I get out of here?

2693
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:42,730
Yeah, this is where we started, but how the fuck do I get out?

2694
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:43,610
Oh, I'm stuck.

2695
01:55:43,610 --> 01:55:44,470
Oh, hey, loot.

2696
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:46,330
Loot time!

2697
01:55:47,890 --> 01:55:48,790
Okay, this way?

2698
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:51,590
So here... Oh, this way.

2699
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:51,950
Okay.

2700
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:55,430
It was like the checkpoints were overlapping each...

2701
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,890
No!

2702
01:55:57,790 --> 01:55:58,270
Okay.

2703
01:55:58,710 --> 01:55:59,190
Okay.

2704
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:00,150
Thank god.

2705
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:01,570
Alright, I thought I fucked up.

2706
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:03,870
Okay, nice.

2707
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:05,370
Nice.

2708
01:56:06,130 --> 01:56:08,090
And then... big jump.

2709
01:56:09,190 --> 01:56:12,270
And then... big jump.

2710
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:12,830
Oh, god.

2711
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:13,590
It's out of focus.

2712
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,690
I messed up.

2713
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,870
I messed this way?

2714
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:19,310
Oh, my god.

2715
01:56:19,370 --> 01:56:23,310
Why am I trying to make my own pathway when I can just follow the yellow brick road?

2716
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:27,150
Okay.

2717
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:30,910
I keep forgetting there's a yellow brick road painted just for me.

2718
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:32,890
Yeah!

2719
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:37,490
Alright, up I go.

2720
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:41,390
I got the jump bot.

2721
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:42,790
It's a lot faster now, too.

2722
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:46,110
Alright.

2723
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:49,470
I get off the jump bot.

2724
01:56:52,190 --> 01:56:53,110
It was loot?

2725
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:54,150
That's fine.

2726
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:54,930
That's not important.

2727
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:58,650
It's fine.

2728
01:56:58,870 --> 01:57:00,970
It can't be that important, guys.

2729
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:04,350
We're just a little under level.

2730
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:05,430
That's okay.

2731
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:05,690
Okay.

2732
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,230
Oh, wait.

2733
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:11,630
What?

2734
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:13,190
No!

2735
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:17,910
Who would've thought?

2736
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:23,550
When I said we shouldn't hide in the aquarium in the tiny city?

2737
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:27,290
I can't believe it.

2738
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:31,830
What I said was gonna happen actually happened?

2739
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:33,090
Hahaha.

2740
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:36,330
Hahaha.

2741
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:38,750
Who could've predicted this?

2742
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:42,070
Is my chairs okay?

2743
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:43,210
Hahaha.

2744
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:45,950
Guys, I need to know.

2745
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:49,370
What about my chairs?

2746
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,190
What a...

2747
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,950
Guys, I spent two hours getting this down.

2748
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:58,510
They can't do this to me.

2749
01:57:59,590 --> 01:58:01,370
My two hours.

2750
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:02,850
Hahaha.

2751
01:58:07,150 --> 01:58:07,790
Alright.

2752
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:10,270
See, I mean, they're okay.

2753
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:11,250
What the fuck?

2754
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:14,630
Why did the outside look so dangerous but everybody's okay?

2755
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:16,450
There's no fire inside.

2756
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:18,550
Where's the fire?

2757
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:23,410
Yeah, what happened?

2758
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:26,310
What?

2759
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:27,630
What?

2760
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:27,730
What?

2761
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:29,030
What?

2762
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:32,170
What?

2763
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:33,770
What?

2764
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:34,690
What?

2765
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:34,730
What?

2766
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:36,690
Who brought them here?

2767
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:37,790
The guy with the scar?

2768
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:38,930
Halfstache?

2769
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:40,150
No.

2770
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:41,870
Their commander was a woman.

2771
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:43,210
Cold as ice.

2772
01:58:43,670 --> 01:58:45,110
Absolutely merciless.

2773
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:47,390
You held out well against them.

2774
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:49,570
Rebel army experience, I guess.

2775
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:51,430
It's not that.

2776
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:53,330
It was Anne who saved us.

2777
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:54,070
What did Anne do?

2778
01:58:54,510 --> 01:58:55,250
Anne did?

2779
01:58:55,310 --> 01:58:56,590
Yeah, they couldn't get past the wall.

2780
01:58:57,510 --> 01:59:00,390
She surrendered, saying she'd lead them to the aquarium.

2781
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:02,110
What was this?

2782
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:04,610
Why is it all the old people saying aquarium?

2783
01:59:04,610 --> 01:59:04,710
Not so much, no.

2784
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:04,910
Cranium.

2785
01:59:10,190 --> 01:59:11,250
There's a secret room?

2786
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:13,210
I don't remember.

2787
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:21,970
Who would've thought?

2788
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:24,470
It's like the army has multiple...

2789
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:26,590
like leaders and power.

2790
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:31,470
Is that crazy, guys?

2791
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:33,290
There's more than two?

2792
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:37,810
Fighting fire with fire, eh?

2793
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:40,310
I hate to admit it, but it makes sense.

2794
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:40,610
No way!

2795
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:43,650
Don't worry, Uncle Bell is gonna save the day.

2796
01:59:43,850 --> 01:59:45,590
Wait, does that mean you're gonna fix my...

2797
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:47,570
Oh my god, finally!

2798
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:48,550
Better Anne!

2799
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:49,950
Hotter Anne!

2800
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:53,810
Finally!

2801
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:57,210
Alright, we can upgrade.

2802
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,290
Oh, we can upgrade a lot, actually.

2803
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:02,590
Wanna go all the way to level 15?

2804
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:06,910
I used all the croc steel again, cause I forgot about you.

2805
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:12,830
Oops, I forgot that you also need to upgrade.

2806
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:13,390
It's alright.

2807
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,570
You didn't need the upgrade.

2808
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:17,750
Oh my gosh, I forgot I need to upgrade the parts too.

2809
02:00:17,890 --> 02:00:19,730
Oh yeah, I used all that up as well.

2810
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:20,570
Okay, oops.

2811
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:24,790
That's awkward.

2812
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:27,750
Alright, let's see if there's any new parts.

2813
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,470
Uh...

2814
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:32,570
Battle tank, battery, fire strength.

2815
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:33,990
Two shots at once.

2816
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:34,730
Okay.

2817
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:39,650
The mag is stronger, but the damage is lower.

2818
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:41,790
So I don't think I'm gonna use...

2819
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:43,510
Yeah, I don't think any of them is...

2820
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:45,170
Better?

2821
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:46,250
Well balanced.

2822
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:47,510
Okay, I like the speed more.

2823
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:49,330
Uh...

2824
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:51,790
Yeah, I don't think there's anything new.

2825
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:56,630
Alright, here we go.

2826
02:00:58,370 --> 02:01:00,230
We gotta go find Anne.

2827
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:06,350
We gotta get Gadget back for my Chip and Dale army.

2828
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,520
This way?

2829
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:15,820
Alright.

2830
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:19,680
This way.

2831
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,360
Buy health potions?

2832
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:25,160
I don't need health potions.

2833
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:26,160
I'm strong enough.

2834
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:33,720
What do you hear?

2835
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,120
What are your special ears?

2836
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:39,840
Holy shit, their tanks are...

2837
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,860
Their tanks look stronger.

2838
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:43,520
Oops, sorry.

2839
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,860
Oh my god.

2840
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:48,460
Her assets.

2841
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:52,660
Bro,

2842
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:56,640
what the fuck?

2843
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:02,420
Guys, her eyes are up there.

2844
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:09,100
Yeah, why are your tanks cooler?

2845
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:30,450
Are they like childhood friends?

2846
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:31,790
No, roommates.

2847
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:33,390
Hahaha.

2848
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:36,550
Ahem.

2849
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:40,550
I would say you're the odd one for remaining so static.

2850
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:43,850
In any case, that's a nice surprise.

2851
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:45,070
Enough pointless chit-chat.

2852
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:50,610
We have an Aquanium radar back in forest land.

2853
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:53,610
Just a couple of gals being pals.

2854
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:57,710
There is no point in continuing this charade.

2855
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:04,720
We'll just see about that.

2856
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:08,000
The girl escaped.

2857
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:09,120
Seize her!

2858
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,740
Oh my god, she just...

2859
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:13,520
I don't think that's called escaping.

2860
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,100
Hahaha.

2861
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,600
She's... Oh my god!

2862
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:22,000
She ran one way.

2863
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,300
She's escaping.

2864
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:29,770
Like, what the fuck?

2865
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:30,630
Hahaha.

2866
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:33,830
That's not escaping.

2867
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:35,830
She just ran away.

2868
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:39,630
Pull yourselves together.

2869
02:03:40,250 --> 02:03:41,670
Remember General Epstein's report.

2870
02:03:41,670 --> 02:03:43,330
Leisurely jogs.

2871
02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:47,730
No, at least we inspected where it came from.

2872
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:51,300
Do something.

2873
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:55,160
Oh my god, there's gun diving!

2874
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:55,500
Oh, my god!

2875
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,360
UAUW!

2876
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:56,500
I was talking to a troll.

2877
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:57,000
Ahaha.

2878
02:03:58,220 --> 02:03:59,740
So fast.

2879
02:03:59,740 --> 02:03:59,760
So fast a fire prince.

2880
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:02,180
Jeious 하고 x2 Ahang.

2881
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:02,340
I move that.

2882
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:05,160
If you want to die, prepare yourda, smart boy.

2883
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:11,060
Agig��다 Nasvaliu!

2884
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:17,360
Press sh gonan bring- You know, not all tanks can be winners.

2885
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,700
Never mind, my tanks are better.

2886
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:23,100
These guys clearly had some budget cuts.

2887
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:26,660
Like, what the fuck?

2888
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,940
Why is your tank so weak?

2889
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:32,300
Did you make your tank out of plastic?

2890
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,160
Mass produced, yeah.

2891
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:37,300
Never mind.

2892
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:41,200
They might look cool, but they were clearly mass produced.

2893
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:43,180
You can buy them on Teemu.

2894
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,280
The power of stats.

2895
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,240
It's one of those tanks you can get for free, but you just have to pay for shipping.

2896
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,260
Oh my god, a gun?

2897
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:15,840
Shoot her!

2898
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:16,700
She's half-dead!

2899
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:16,860
A demon!

2900
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:19,480
Take the risk!

2901
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:22,980
The bullet will bounce off, right?

2902
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:25,560
She must have got the better half, right?

2903
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:26,680
Of the demon part?

2904
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:38,460
Dropship tanks.

2905
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:51,260
No, you freaks know where these things could have gone.

2906
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:51,300
Woah!

2907
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:52,980
Bro!

2908
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,700
This is very xenophobic.

2909
02:05:58,680 --> 02:05:59,280
Good.

2910
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,560
Bring it to me, or else.

2911
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:02,360
Woah!

2912
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:04,240
I'm gonna write...

2913
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:07,160
You don't want me to write a twit longer and cancel you?

2914
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:09,480
Just do it!

2915
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,900
Forget about me!

2916
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:14,900
Keep the aquarium safe!

2917
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:16,840
Yeah, you can't say that anymore!

2918
02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:19,380
I can't do that, man.

2919
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:24,960
You can't say that word anymore!

2920
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:28,460
Who else?

2921
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,020
I would forgive her.

2922
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:34,480
Look!

2923
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:36,200
Just because...

2924
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,160
Wait, where's the gun?

2925
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:38,460
Why are they just standing there?

2926
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:39,180
Like that?

2927
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:41,840
Hello?

2928
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:43,860
Stop right there!

2929
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:44,200
Oh.

2930
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:45,560
Where is the aquarium?

2931
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:46,580
Why are they just...

2932
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:48,520
Why are they just standing like that?

2933
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:51,480
I'm like, what they just...

2934
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:54,240
Man standing emoji.

2935
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:55,820
Sorry, woman standing emoji.

2936
02:06:58,940 --> 02:07:01,320
I'm just like, why are they just standing there?

2937
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,040
What the fuck?

2938
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:07,160
I can't call Ryan if they use my goddamn legs?

2939
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:08,960
I can't believe it.

2940
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,480
If they use my legs, guys...

2941
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,800
Friends.

2942
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:13,580
What?

2943
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:16,860
You trying to say we can't give this up just to save some girl?

2944
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,080
Oh, it's this way.

2945
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:18,840
I would never.

2946
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:22,460
We can't leave Lady and her daughter in the hands of her enemies.

2947
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:23,120
Can we just put it here?

2948
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:26,540
Wow, this hole is like... not very secret.

2949
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:29,860
We're just gonna fork it over to them?

2950
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,040
This is literally the first hole.

2951
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,020
Not all of them.

2952
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:35,080
All are getting into this one capsule.

2953
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,520
Guys, this hole is not very secure.

2954
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:40,120
It's literally the first hole you find.

2955
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:42,900
After all, they still don't know that we also got the one from the Merrick battleship.

2956
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:46,060
And what they don't know, they won't get.

2957
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:47,020
Yeah.

2958
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:47,980
I see.

2959
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:50,900
Serves them right.

2960
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:54,620
How do you figure out that there's a hole there?

2961
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:57,400
There's so many holes in this cave.

2962
02:07:57,580 --> 02:07:59,020
Caves are filled with holes.

2963
02:07:59,360 --> 02:07:59,920
We have it here.

2964
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:02,320
Then throw it to me.

2965
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:04,960
Throw it to you?

2966
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:09,000
The whole issue regarding the aquarium is that we can't drop it.

2967
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:11,260
We did what you said.

2968
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:12,500
I let Anne go.

2969
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,160
That is actually fucking crazy.

2970
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:16,300
She was like, throw the aquarium.

2971
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,840
Why did I do that?

2972
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:21,000
I made no such promise.

2973
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:23,780
What?

2974
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,900
But we gave you the aquarium.

2975
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,640
You should have thrown the girl first.

2976
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:29,900
Did I say I'd release her in exchange?

2977
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,700
Oh my gosh, she got me there.

2978
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:33,120
She's so smart.

2979
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:35,780
As if I would ever negotiate with demons.

2980
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,940
Then what are you gonna do with her?

2981
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,880
Can't say that anymore.

2982
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:45,480
Like I would tell you, demon.

2983
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:49,280
Oh my god, she's so...

2984
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:57,700
My experience with General Rosetta.

2985
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:00,040
164.

2986
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:03,020
My 1800...

2987
02:09:03,020 --> 02:09:07,460
My like 50 page document on Google Docs.

2988
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:12,600
Don't move.

2989
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:17,780
Follow me and the princess will pay.

2990
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:22,140
None of you are to move a muscle until we are fully out of sight.

2991
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:24,180
How would they know she's not even looking back?

2992
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:25,780
Damn.

2993
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:28,720
I thought I busted up every last one of their tanks.

2994
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:32,820
Looks like some of them just pretended to be out of commission.

2995
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:33,390
They exploded.

2996
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:36,240
What do you mean pretended to be out of commission?

2997
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,340
Right on.

2998
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,960
We both saw the tanks explode.

2999
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,520
How can you pretend?

3000
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:48,540
Yeah, what about just fast travel?

3001
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:49,780
I know how you feel, prince.

3002
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:51,620
But get a hold of yourself.

3003
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:54,560
We still have a chance to get Anne back.

3004
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:57,800
You can pretend to explode.

3005
02:09:57,800 --> 02:10:01,320
We know where to find more Aquanium that we can use as a bargaining chip.

3006
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:04,180
Bargaining smarganing.

3007
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:06,320
I literally only have one Aquanium.

3008
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:07,020
What do you mean?

3009
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:09,420
I only have like one more.

3010
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:10,060
That's my spirit.

3011
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:10,700
This...

3012
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:12,740
This land has two Aquaniums.

3013
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,240
I can't just find more.

3014
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,660
Can I go to forest land yet?

3015
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:28,280
We must be able to go to forest land, right guys?

3016
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,380
Is it time?

3017
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:35,920
Okay, my two whole Aquaniums.

3018
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:37,060
Alright.

3019
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:38,920
What do you have for me, General?

3020
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:42,000
There you are.

3021
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,240
You don't look so good.

3022
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:47,160
Anyone can tell you've barely slept for weeks.

3023
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:49,320
It's been weeks?

3024
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,940
I swear, I thought this whole thing happened in like three days.

3025
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:56,320
Wait, wait, how can...

3026
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:57,320
What?

3027
02:10:57,480 --> 02:10:59,440
How can it be weeks already?

3028
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:02,720
I thought it's been like two to three days.

3029
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:05,420
You don't look so chipper yourself.

3030
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:07,860
A lot's happened.

3031
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:11,600
I already saw you like two hours ago.

3032
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:13,920
They took Anne?

3033
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:15,420
And the Aquanium too?

3034
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:18,440
Is forest land even real?

3035
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:20,020
I'm not going to hurt Anne, right?

3036
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:22,880
I can't say for sure.

3037
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:26,300
We'll have to go to forest land after them.

3038
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:29,020
Would you be able to help us get across the border?

3039
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:30,220
It's been following real time.

3040
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:33,880
I left the game two weeks ago and it's been following that since.

3041
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:35,060
There's currently a powder keg.

3042
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:42,360
There's only a small sliver of land beyond the big dam where our territory and forest lands meet in the first place.

3043
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:46,920
And with our armies at a standoff, not even a scorpion could slip through.

3044
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:48,620
Let us at them.

3045
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:50,560
We'll just force our way through.

3046
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:53,700
If you attack at the flashpoint, it'll look bad.

3047
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:57,220
Like we've allied with the demons to attack forest land.

3048
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:59,140
Then we really would have given you a pretense for war.

3049
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:01,280
Are there actually no demons in forest land?

3050
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,900
I think that horse has left the stable.

3051
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,040
Except for like my sister.

3052
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,960
That's kind of a tricky subject, you know.

3053
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,520
Our forces aren't organized.

3054
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:12,820
We can't risk all out war yet.

3055
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:15,080
So we can't go to forest land?

3056
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,500
Is that what you're saying?

3057
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:18,940
No, they can't do this to me!

3058
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:21,540
I swear I wouldn't clickbait this time!

3059
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:24,280
Have you ever heard of the Cardamo subterranean lake ruins?

3060
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,160
No.

3061
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:26,680
Maybe?

3062
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,080
Oh, they killed all of them.

3063
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:33,360
Oh my god, they're serious about being xenophobic.

3064
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:36,260
It wasn't a joke.

3065
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:37,340
Now that the river's back.

3066
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,740
I don't know whether you can make your way through.

3067
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:44,740
At the very least, you're going to need some sort of boat.

3068
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:48,580
In that case, we've got the perfect ride.

3069
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:50,520
The hoverbot!

3070
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,460
Oh yeah, the hoverbot!

3071
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:57,140
Without Anne and blueprints, we can't assemble the bot.

3072
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:01,380
Well in that case, allow me to lend a hand.

3073
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:02,240
Finally!

3074
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:05,100
I still have the plans from when I was helping Anne.

3075
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:08,100
Plans for a hoverbot?

3076
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:09,780
That's awfully convenient.

3077
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
It's designed for crossing over quicksand, but it'll work.

3078
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:15,880
Really?

3079
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:17,880
Well, the Peachy know their bots.

3080
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:24,500
Yeah, wouldn't the Peachy be better than Anne because the Peachy, like, did more technology stuff?

3081
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:25,640
That we do!

3082
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,900
So why did we let Anne upgrade our stuff?

3083
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:29,300
I'll stage a little distraction on you.

3084
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:33,700
We should have had Polack done all our upgrades.

3085
02:13:35,740 --> 02:13:37,140
Nice job, veteran!

3086
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:42,020
Oh my god.

3087
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,020
What would you like to do?

3088
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:44,340
Do we have to...

3089
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:46,840
Do we have to, like, you know...

3090
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:49,360
Go back to save her?

3091
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,940
I mean, we already have a replacement.

3092
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:54,940
Alright, we need to create...

3093
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,060
How do we create vehicles again?

3094
02:13:57,820 --> 02:13:59,100
Make vehicles... oh there we go.

3095
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:00,700
Uh, hover...

3096
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,500
No!

3097
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:02,980
Wait, what...

3098
02:14:03,850 --> 02:14:05,140
Primary weapon...

3099
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:08,480
Secondary weapon, engine, suspension.

3100
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:09,100
Okay.

3101
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:12,120
Parts.

3102
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:12,640
Make parts.

3103
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:13,440
Alright.

3104
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:15,660
We need to make hover...

3105
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:16,400
Oh, we have everything.

3106
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,780
There's a dirt buggy?

3107
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,220
We have another car?

3108
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:24,900
Wait!

3109
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:26,720
Wait a minute!

3110
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:30,250
When did this car show up?

3111
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:34,480
I didn't even notice the other car!

3112
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:35,880
Alright.

3113
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:37,460
Well, we don't need that.

3114
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,860
We literally have a motorbike, so...

3115
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:41,660
I feel like we don't need that.

3116
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:42,380
Anyway.

3117
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:45,360
Quality gunpowder.

3118
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:46,820
Rocket launcher.

3119
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:48,240
Dual... super...

3120
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:49,640
Okay, I'm too lazy to...

3121
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:52,100
We're not farming materials, man.

3122
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:55,200
We're not getting any of that.

3123
02:14:58,220 --> 02:14:59,420
Okay, here we go.

3124
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:00,620
Anyway, we're gonna get that.

3125
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:02,820
Yeah!

3126
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:07,300
Uh, vehicle...

3127
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:09,020
Make vehicle...

3128
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,220
Hover car.

3129
02:15:11,620 --> 02:15:12,720
Okay, we have this.

3130
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:14,040
Oh.

3131
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,380
Okay, and then equipment.

3132
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:17,340
There we go.

3133
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:19,540
That should be it, right?

3134
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:20,480
Did I make it?

3135
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:24,420
Oh, wait.

3136
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:25,140
I did make it.

3137
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,380
Oops.

3138
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,550
Okay.

3139
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:32,450
I don't have croc steel!

3140
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:33,310
No!

3141
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:37,070
I need... B grade...

3142
02:15:37,070 --> 02:15:38,810
Okay, where the fuck is that merchant?

3143
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:42,530
We need croc steel and B grade...

3144
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:44,450
Okay.

3145
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:46,090
You should have it, right?

3146
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:48,710
You should have it, Vess, right?

3147
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:50,810
B grade... Was it B grade steel?

3148
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:53,270
No, I don't have the money.

3149
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:54,330
I need...

3150
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:55,970
What the fuck is a desert crocodile?

3151
02:15:57,870 --> 02:15:59,710
What's a desert crocodile?

3152
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,950
What's a desert crocodile?

3153
02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:04,670
Have I seen a desert crocodile?

3154
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:08,680
What?

3155
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:10,900
Thank you!

3156
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:11,500
What?

3157
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:12,640
What?

3158
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:15,720
Have I ever seen one?

3159
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:17,360
I don't even remember.

3160
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:19,580
Okay, like one time.

3161
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:21,780
Okay, that does not sound great.

3162
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,460
Alright, let's see.

3163
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:26,100
Can I decrease the level of the car?

3164
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:26,700
Yeah.

3165
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:30,950
No.

3166
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:32,270
No.

3167
02:16:33,210 --> 02:16:33,970
No!

3168
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:39,050
What does this guy have to be level 12?

3169
02:16:40,590 --> 02:16:41,350
What does this guy have to be level 12?

3170
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:45,330
Why is that?

3171
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:46,850
Why, Pollock?

3172
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:49,550
I don't wanna be Mr. Fancy Pants!

3173
02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:51,130
Why, Pollock?

3174
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:51,130
I don't wanna be Mr. Fancy Pants!

3175
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:51,130
Why, Pollock?

3176
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:51,650
I don't wanna be Mr. Fancy Pants!

3177
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:54,690
Oh my god.

3178
02:16:55,250 --> 02:16:57,690
Alright, we gotta figure out where...

3179
02:16:57,690 --> 02:16:57,770
Alright, we gotta figure out where...

3180
02:16:59,650 --> 02:17:00,630
No!

3181
02:17:02,390 --> 02:17:04,110
Near quicksand.

3182
02:17:04,250 --> 02:17:06,210
Guys, where was quicksand again?

3183
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:08,450
Is this quicksand?

3184
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:10,210
Sand cascade.

3185
02:17:10,710 --> 02:17:11,970
East Valley.

3186
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:13,870
Guys, where is quicksand?

3187
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:17,230
Giant raptor cave.

3188
02:17:18,550 --> 02:17:19,040
Mineshaft.

3189
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:21,040
Eternal nest.

3190
02:17:22,230 --> 02:17:23,530
Junk pit.

3191
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:26,090
What was quicksand?

3192
02:17:26,770 --> 02:17:27,750
Self.

3193
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:28,830
Self somewhere.

3194
02:17:29,270 --> 02:17:30,130
Thank you.

3195
02:17:32,250 --> 02:17:34,170
It's just self somewhere.

3196
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:37,150
What the fuck is a...

3197
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:40,110
Where the fuck does quicksand look like?

3198
02:17:41,810 --> 02:17:43,910
What does it look like?

3199
02:17:44,450 --> 02:17:45,850
What does it look like?

3200
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:46,630
What does it look like?

3201
02:17:46,830 --> 02:17:48,430
It may be...

3202
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:49,630
It may be...

3203
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:52,170
Okay, maybe there's one here.

3204
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:54,170
Okay, those are scorpions.

3205
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:55,670
Is this quicksand?

3206
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:58,650
I mean, there's so many sand.

3207
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,510
How do I know which one is...

3208
02:18:00,510 --> 02:18:01,890
What is...

3209
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:02,730
Which one is quick?

3210
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:06,210
I guess we'll go down?

3211
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:09,870
It looks like sand, but how do we know it's quick?

3212
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:12,630
It looks like sand, but how do we know it's quick?

3213
02:18:12,630 --> 02:18:14,750
It looks like sand, but how do we know it's quick?

3214
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,290
Kill it.

3215
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:20,990
Is that quick?

3216
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:21,770
Is that quick?

3217
02:18:22,030 --> 02:18:23,670
Is that quick?

3218
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:27,170
One that goes quicker.

3219
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:29,510
One that goes quicker...

3220
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:30,730
Bro.

3221
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:35,890
Why doesn't it tell you what quicksand looks like?

3222
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:37,270
Why doesn't it tell you what quicksand looks like?

3223
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:37,710
Like, I'm not...

3224
02:18:37,710 --> 02:18:38,550
Looks like... I mean like...

3225
02:18:38,550 --> 02:18:40,350
What does it tell you where it is?

3226
02:18:41,430 --> 02:18:43,050
I don't understand.

3227
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:47,190
Just show me where it is.

3228
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:49,350
That looks like quicksand.

3229
02:18:50,570 --> 02:18:51,390
It's a...

3230
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:52,750
Oh, there is crocodiles!

3231
02:18:55,330 --> 02:18:56,870
Oh my god, this is it!

3232
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:59,870
This is the first time I saw a crocodile!

3233
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:03,490
This is it!

3234
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:05,470
There's a cave or something under the quicksand.

3235
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:07,130
There's a cave or something under the quicksand.

3236
02:19:07,210 --> 02:19:10,670
Sorry, the aquarium messed me up a little bit.

3237
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:12,310
No, no, please.

3238
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:13,470
Get me out.

3239
02:19:13,550 --> 02:19:14,970
Oh, I need to get the bike out.

3240
02:19:15,050 --> 02:19:15,250
No!

3241
02:19:16,250 --> 02:19:17,570
Get closer, crocodile!

3242
02:19:17,570 --> 02:19:18,050
Crocodile!

3243
02:19:18,370 --> 02:19:20,710
Get closer, I need your love!

3244
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:25,510
Get closer, crocodile!

3245
02:19:26,910 --> 02:19:27,510
Get closer, crocodile!

3246
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:28,090
Okay, there you go.

3247
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:29,230
Leave them.

3248
02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:30,450
I need...

3249
02:19:32,170 --> 02:19:33,790
I need to get there.

3250
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:35,890
Okay, nice.

3251
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:37,010
Alright.

3252
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:39,750
They might have survived millennia.

3253
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:41,710
I see a huge crocodile!

3254
02:19:41,950 --> 02:19:43,170
Wait, that's a huge...

3255
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:45,030
Oh, shit!

3256
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:47,330
It's fine.

3257
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:47,970
Don't worry.

3258
02:19:48,030 --> 02:19:49,230
That's why I have...

3259
02:19:49,230 --> 02:19:49,490
No!

3260
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:51,850
That's not what I mean!

3261
02:19:53,430 --> 02:19:54,990
Oh, hey, they're just...

3262
02:19:54,990 --> 02:19:55,710
Oh, shit, okay.

3263
02:19:55,950 --> 02:19:57,990
I was gonna say, that's why I have Raiol.

3264
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:00,630
It's okay.

3265
02:20:01,110 --> 02:20:02,710
Push him into the cave!

3266
02:20:03,850 --> 02:20:05,630
Keep clear and attack from a distance!

3267
02:20:05,830 --> 02:20:06,390
Okay, nice.

3268
02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:07,050
I'll just stay here.

3269
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:08,530
That's what Raiol is for.

3270
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:11,790
Raiol, what the fuck are they doing?

3271
02:20:12,030 --> 02:20:12,250
Bro!

3272
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:15,150
Move along!

3273
02:20:15,150 --> 02:20:16,810
This is not your fight!

3274
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:18,650
What are you doing here?

3275
02:20:19,530 --> 02:20:22,730
The random raptor that just came in.

3276
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:25,190
The random raptor that just came in.

3277
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:27,610
He's just like, hey, I wanna have fun too.

3278
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:28,170
He's just like, hey, I wanna have fun too.

3279
02:20:28,350 --> 02:20:29,410
Let me in.

3280
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:30,170
Let me at him.

3281
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:31,930
Okay, nice.

3282
02:20:32,050 --> 02:20:33,350
I killed husband and wife.

3283
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:34,030
Okay, nice.

3284
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:34,030
I killed husband and wife.

3285
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:34,490
Yeah!

3286
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:37,990
More crocodile steel!

3287
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:40,010
Thank god.

3288
02:20:40,990 --> 02:20:42,090
Alright, let's go in.

3289
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:44,310
Let's go in.

3290
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:45,650
I might as well.

3291
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:46,550
I'm here anyway.

3292
02:20:47,370 --> 02:20:47,990
Yay!

3293
02:20:48,910 --> 02:20:50,410
We might as well.

3294
02:20:51,290 --> 02:20:54,030
Might as well grab some extra loot too.

3295
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:56,290
Okay.

3296
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:57,910
Alright.

3297
02:20:59,710 --> 02:21:00,330
Yay!

3298
02:21:01,630 --> 02:21:04,910
They survived millennia of evolution.

3299
02:21:05,050 --> 02:21:06,950
They outlived the dinosaurs.

3300
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:09,470
Just for me to come in here with my tank.

3301
02:21:09,670 --> 02:21:10,290
I'm gonna go in.

3302
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:12,070
I'm gonna go in.

3303
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:13,110
That's good.

3304
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:13,950
Oh, we need the cobra.

3305
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:16,610
We need that for upgrades too.

3306
02:21:20,390 --> 02:21:23,990
If they didn't want to die to a tank, they should have been extinct.

3307
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:27,030
Oh, wait.

3308
02:21:27,070 --> 02:21:27,570
What the fuck?

3309
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:28,310
What's he gonna do?

3310
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:29,290
Fight my tank?

3311
02:21:31,470 --> 02:21:32,970
Knowing what they can do...

3312
02:21:32,970 --> 02:21:34,390
That's what they get for adapting.

3313
02:21:36,490 --> 02:21:37,370
Oh, no.

3314
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:38,110
I'm sorry.

3315
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:39,270
I did not mean it.

3316
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:40,270
No!

3317
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:41,430
My tank!

3318
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:43,510
My tank is stuck!

3319
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:44,130
It's stuck in the hole!

3320
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:48,070
Yeah, they shouldn't have evolved.

3321
02:21:48,270 --> 02:21:49,210
Yeah, they shouldn't have evolved.

3322
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:50,390
You're right!

3323
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:53,450
The crocodile shouldn't have evolved to be anti-tank!

3324
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:56,510
Whoa.

3325
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:57,610
How did I do that?

3326
02:21:58,350 --> 02:22:02,330
If they didn't want to die, they should have evolved better.

3327
02:22:05,830 --> 02:22:06,350
Alright.

3328
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:06,870
Nice.

3329
02:22:10,410 --> 02:22:11,390
Is there...

3330
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:11,850
Oh, wait.

3331
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:12,310
There's more?

3332
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:13,990
Wait.

3333
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:14,530
I can't...

3334
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:15,210
What?

3335
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:19,450
My tank's not strong enough!

3336
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:22,130
There's no way!

3337
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:24,690
My tank is too baby!

3338
02:22:27,610 --> 02:22:28,250
Alright.

3339
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:28,610
It's fine.

3340
02:22:28,850 --> 02:22:30,190
We'll just kill the scorpions.

3341
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:33,730
Alright.

3342
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:35,830
Let's mine this area.

3343
02:22:36,550 --> 02:22:37,990
Oh, it's a crawl space?

3344
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:39,050
Oh, I couldn't tell.

3345
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:41,010
Nothing.

3346
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:44,750
I'm gonna beat the other guy to a pulp!

3347
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:46,850
That's a start.

3348
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:50,090
But you might get better results by predicting what your enemy is going to do.

3349
02:22:50,090 --> 02:22:50,110
I couldn't see a hole in there.

3350
02:22:50,110 --> 02:22:50,370
There it was.

3351
02:22:50,450 --> 02:22:51,070
Oh, there it is!

3352
02:22:51,410 --> 02:22:52,550
And reacting accordingly.

3353
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:53,630
I see the hole.

3354
02:22:56,210 --> 02:22:57,710
Give me a sec, scorpion.

3355
02:22:58,310 --> 02:22:59,210
Give me a sec!

3356
02:22:59,390 --> 02:23:00,230
Oh my god!

3357
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,010
That's fucked up!

3358
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:02,310
I'm still crawling!

3359
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:03,570
Here we go!

3360
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:11,010
Guys, even though I killed your entire family, it does not give you the right to spit acid on me.

3361
02:23:11,010 --> 02:23:13,070
What the fuck is that?

3362
02:23:15,730 --> 02:23:16,330
Uhh...

3363
02:23:16,330 --> 02:23:17,310
What is that?

3364
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:20,390
What did I do?

3365
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:23,810
Yeah, I got spawn camped.

3366
02:23:24,490 --> 02:23:25,290
Oh no.

3367
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:26,490
Nooooo!

3368
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:28,070
Okay, let me...

3369
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:31,090
Alright, I'll get off the bike.

3370
02:23:31,390 --> 02:23:32,910
It blocked the hole.

3371
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:34,230
Alright.

3372
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:35,090
Apaco.

3373
02:23:36,710 --> 02:23:37,970
Give me the loot!

3374
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:38,130
Dude!

3375
02:23:39,790 --> 02:23:42,670
Wait, I'm outside?

3376
02:23:44,050 --> 02:23:45,390
Wait, what?

3377
02:23:46,510 --> 02:23:47,790
Where am I?

3378
02:23:49,790 --> 02:23:50,430
What?

3379
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:57,540
There's...

3380
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:59,280
I thought there was more...

3381
02:23:59,280 --> 02:23:59,800
That's it?

3382
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:02,200
That was it?

3383
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:04,480
It just took me here?

3384
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:08,280
I'm back in the sand.

3385
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,620
Okay, now...

3386
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:09,920
I'm back in the sand.

3387
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:10,000
I'm back in the sand.

3388
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:10,280
Okay, now...

3389
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:11,640
Oh god, I have to get out of here.

3390
02:24:13,060 --> 02:24:16,320
Guys, I'll get to forest land, I swear to god!

3391
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:16,800
Guys!

3392
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:19,100
We just had some...

3393
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:21,720
some little intermissions.

3394
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:23,660
Some technical difficulties.

3395
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:25,300
In the sand.

3396
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:27,300
Alright, now I should be able to travel.

3397
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:29,360
No!

3398
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:30,560
There's still enemies?

3399
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:31,120
No!

3400
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:32,380
There's still enemies?

3401
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:32,440
Stop!

3402
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:35,240
Alright, that guy's gonna die.

3403
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:36,280
I don't care about him.

3404
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:40,460
I need to make sure I fly away from everybody.

3405
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:42,860
Okay, now I should be able to fast travel.

3406
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:43,780
God damn it!

3407
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:45,820
Why is there so many wildlife?

3408
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:50,260
Now I should be able to travel.

3409
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:53,240
Alright.

3410
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:55,320
It's not a myth, it's real!

3411
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:57,760
Anne came from forest land!

3412
02:24:58,040 --> 02:24:58,360
Chad!

3413
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,200
She came from forest land!

3414
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:02,480
It has to be real!

3415
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:06,000
Okay, we need to buy...

3416
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:07,400
the... what was it called?

3417
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:09,660
Was it bolt or steel, Chad?

3418
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:12,500
I don't remember if it was bolt or steel.

3419
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:13,900
Because we have a lot of iron ore anyway.

3420
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:19,640
Who is Anne?

3421
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:21,120
She's my niece, apparently.

3422
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,640
Was it steel or...

3423
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:25,740
was it... it's bolt?

3424
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,440
Alright.

3425
02:25:28,740 --> 02:25:29,620
Like 20?

3426
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,600
Okay, we'll buy 20.

3427
02:25:30,860 --> 02:25:32,920
I don't remember how many I need, so I'll just buy 20.

3428
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:35,740
Croc steel.

3429
02:25:35,940 --> 02:25:36,800
Oh yeah, croc steel.

3430
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:38,660
We need it.

3431
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,440
I'll buy 5, because I don't remember how many we need.

3432
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:42,120
Thank you!

3433
02:25:42,620 --> 02:25:43,440
Alright, nice.

3434
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:46,180
One day you'll be just as good as your brother, Bob.

3435
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:53,380
Alright, we can finally make our god damn car.

3436
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,560
Alright, we can finally make our god damn car.

3437
02:25:57,560 --> 02:25:58,240
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

3438
02:25:59,160 --> 02:25:59,840
Okay, nice.

3439
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:02,560
Do I have money?

3440
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:04,240
No, I should have.

3441
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:06,560
Why am I missing?

3442
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:10,400
Why am I missing?

3443
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,340
Why can't I...

3444
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:15,780
Why won't it let me upgrade?

3445
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:18,940
I don't...

3446
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:19,920
I don't understand.

3447
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:24,320
Let me make the car!

3448
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:27,060
What am I missing?

3449
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:28,840
I...

3450
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:35,240
Guys, I did not realize there was a...

3451
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:36,680
There was a scroll bar.

3452
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:40,520
Okay.

3453
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:42,180
I need scorpion.

3454
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,300
Alright.

3455
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:45,620
Scorpion alloy.

3456
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:47,500
Where the fuck?

3457
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:49,860
How do I make scorpion alloy?

3458
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:52,580
And why can't you make...

3459
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:55,860
Why can't I only make oil?

3460
02:26:57,940 --> 02:26:58,760
Thank you!

3461
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:02,680
Why are you not as good as your brother?

3462
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:03,380
What?

3463
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:06,520
How do I...

3464
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,780
How do I make scorpion alloy?

3465
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:09,120
Hello!

3466
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:12,520
Go to the trader post.

3467
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:13,940
I have a trader's post?

3468
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:16,860
What the fuck is a trader's post?

3469
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:19,540
Who is the trader?

3470
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:22,640
Don't I have like a permanent trader?

3471
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:23,320
Oh, here.

3472
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:26,680
Are you a trader?

3473
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:28,300
No.

3474
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,020
You're not a trader.

3475
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,700
Oh my god.

3476
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:34,960
I can't believe it.

3477
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:36,420
I should have...

3478
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:38,000
I should have picked...

3479
02:27:38,780 --> 02:27:40,020
Oh, oh she...

3480
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:41,740
He gave me a scorpion alloy!

3481
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,660
Oh thank god!

3482
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:43,600
I got a freebie!

3483
02:27:43,820 --> 02:27:45,260
Oh thank god!

3484
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,080
Thank you!

3485
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:49,100
Thank you Nyanjinboo!

3486
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:50,900
For the freebie!

3487
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:53,900
Oh thank god!

3488
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:55,180
Oh thank god!

3489
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:59,180
Okay, now we can make it.

3490
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:01,400
Alright.

3491
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:04,260
Okay, what do we call you?

3492
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:06,540
We're gonna call you...

3493
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:08,800
A mistake.

3494
02:28:10,300 --> 02:28:10,820
Alright.

3495
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:12,140
There you go.

3496
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:12,540
Yay!

3497
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:20,020
You did it Polack!

3498
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:30,320
Let's put it back here again!

3499
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:32,420
We didn't learn our lesson.

3500
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,600
We're gonna use the Equanium Radar back in Forest Land.

3501
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:44,820
If that's true, trying to hide the Equanium is gonna be pointless.

3502
02:28:46,420 --> 02:28:50,640
So that's how they always seem to know exactly where to find it.

3503
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:53,960
But wait, if that's true...

3504
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:55,540
Why couldn't they do it earlier then?

3505
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:58,800
We'll expose our own location.

3506
02:28:59,560 --> 02:28:59,620
Yeah.

3507
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:00,440
Well you're right, Ral.

3508
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:04,740
Would you mind showing me that Equanium for a second please?

3509
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:06,880
Sure.

3510
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:13,800
Their radar is probably just a receiver.

3511
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,940
We want it tuned specifically to the wavelength of Equanium.

3512
02:29:18,460 --> 02:29:22,920
Versus sending out radio pulses that bounce off the Equanium and back to them.

3513
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,720
You're so smart Polack.

3514
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:29,460
Which means all we have to do is...

3515
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:32,940
Wait, Better Anna is literally better in every way!

3516
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:36,280
Why wasn't she doing upgrades on my tanks?

3517
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:38,080
I see.

3518
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:38,500
I see.

3519
02:29:39,500 --> 02:29:41,000
I can figure that out in like 10 seconds.

3520
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:43,480
You mean you understand how it works?

3521
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,520
Of course not.

3522
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:49,220
But whatever they just did means that radar can't find it now, right?

3523
02:29:50,860 --> 02:29:52,820
She should have been my main mechanic.

3524
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:55,980
Well that takes care of my concerns.

3525
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:57,420
Time to go.

3526
02:29:59,320 --> 02:29:59,880
Yeah!

3527
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:02,540
Just you wait Forest Land army!

3528
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:04,520
Anne could have done that!

3529
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:07,900
Anne could have literally covered up the Equanium in the beginning!

3530
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:08,880
Hahaha!

3531
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:15,220
Exactly did they need Anne to show them the way if they have radar.

3532
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:15,660
Yeah.

3533
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:16,140
That's true.

3534
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:20,120
Probably because they can't call back home while they're in Sand Land.

3535
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:25,200
This gap in their communication network is one of the few advantages...

3536
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,620
Don't have enough walkie talkies.

3537
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:30,040
Alright let's hang out with Better Anne for a little bit.

3538
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,020
I'm gonna use the bathroom chat.

3539
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:31,520
I'll be back.

3540
02:30:31,660 --> 02:30:32,640
First bathroom break.

3541
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:33,780
I'll be back guys.

3542
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:11,860
Hey guys!

3543
02:34:12,300 --> 02:34:13,320
I'm back!

3544
02:34:13,660 --> 02:34:14,180
Alright.

3545
02:34:15,540 --> 02:34:17,780
Time to finally use my mistake.

3546
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:20,920
Uhhhhhh.

3547
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:21,920
We gotta go.

3548
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:22,680
Wait where do we...

3549
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:23,340
Okay wait.

3550
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:24,780
Is your quest over there?

3551
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:25,320
No.

3552
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,640
We're not talking to that lady in the furniture shop.

3553
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:30,220
We don't know her.

3554
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:31,140
Hahaha!

3555
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:34,900
Guess we never talk to the lady in the furniture shop.

3556
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:35,220
Okay?

3557
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:40,760
The lady at the furniture shop is off limits.

3558
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:43,040
Uhhhhhh.

3559
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:44,740
Where do I have to go?

3560
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:45,880
Oh this way.

3561
02:34:46,420 --> 02:34:50,040
Is there like a closer spot?

3562
02:34:51,580 --> 02:34:54,700
Is there a closer spot there?

3563
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:58,840
Yeah she is a no go guys.

3564
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:00,920
Please.

3565
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:03,220
Please.

3566
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:06,300
I never expected Sandland...

3567
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:08,420
Forestland to be so far.

3568
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:10,000
Hahaha!

3569
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:13,460
Who would have thought?

3570
02:35:13,620 --> 02:35:14,120
Hahaha!

3571
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:14,120
Who would have thought?

3572
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:15,340
Ow.

3573
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:19,440
Why is Forestland so far?

3574
02:35:19,700 --> 02:35:20,380
Why is Forestland so far?

3575
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:24,740
Who's this guy?

3576
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:26,360
Wait that's a child.

3577
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,500
What is this child doing here?

3578
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:31,940
What is this child doing here?

3579
02:35:31,980 --> 02:35:33,160
What is this child doing here?

3580
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:34,100
Where's your parents?

3581
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:34,720
Where's your parents?

3582
02:35:35,580 --> 02:35:36,500
Who?

3583
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:40,260
Hahaha!

3584
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:42,680
Hahaha!

3585
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:45,580
Beezlebub those are supposed to be our inside thoughts.

3586
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:46,400
Hahaha!

3587
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:49,840
You're not the flower person?

3588
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:53,800
That's our inside thoughts Beezlebub.

3589
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:54,200
That's our inside thoughts Beezlebub.

3590
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:55,400
Can't you see I'm a fiend?

3591
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:57,860
Oh sorry.

3592
02:35:58,480 --> 02:35:59,860
I'm blind.

3593
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:01,540
Oh shit!

3594
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:04,680
You bullied a blind person Beezlebub!

3595
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:05,900
You bullied a blind person Beezlebub!

3596
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:07,520
Should you be outside on your own?

3597
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:10,160
Grandma said I mustn't.

3598
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:11,880
That's fucked up.

3599
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:16,120
I just had to thank the flower person.

3600
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:17,880
It's okay he's already in hell.

3601
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:18,800
He's already a demon.

3602
02:36:19,540 --> 02:36:20,600
Yeah who is he?

3603
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:23,820
They always leave flowers for me when I'm not paying attention.

3604
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:25,700
Okay.

3605
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:27,920
Okay that's a little...

3606
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:29,580
That's a little uncomfortable little girl.

3607
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:30,480
Hahaha!

3608
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:33,740
Yeah why did they do that?

3609
02:36:34,060 --> 02:36:34,820
I don't know.

3610
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:37,780
That's why I want to ask them.

3611
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:40,020
They're gonna hear me eat lunch and dinner right now.

3612
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:45,680
If they come in secret.

3613
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:48,380
They'd likely stay away if they saw you.

3614
02:36:49,180 --> 02:36:50,240
Oh my god.

3615
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:55,260
I just wanted to thank them for all those fragrant flowers.

3616
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:57,000
I just wanted to thank them for all those fragrant flowers.

3617
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,480
Do you have any idea as to who it might be?

3618
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:00,320
Do you have any idea as to who it might be?

3619
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:01,140
Is it your parents?

3620
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:07,140
Sometimes I feel like...

3621
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:07,400
Sometimes I feel like...

3622
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:09,120
I can smell a hint of fragrance.

3623
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:25,100
Grandma!

3624
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:29,000
We are not the people you should be worried about.

3625
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:32,200
You should be worried about the flower person.

3626
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:41,560
Wait, how do you...

3627
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:43,800
How could a demon not be bad?

3628
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:48,420
Grandma, we're not the one you should be worried about.

3629
02:37:49,060 --> 02:37:50,600
That's why I hate humans.

3630
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:52,560
Let's teach her a lesson, Prince.

3631
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:54,560
What for?

3632
02:37:55,300 --> 02:37:56,320
She knows her stuff.

3633
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:58,260
Demons are evil, alright.

3634
02:37:59,540 --> 02:37:59,980
Damn.

3635
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:03,120
You plan on looking for that flower person, right?

3636
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:06,140
She sounds like somebody that used to live in Forestland.

3637
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,120
Do you mind if we make a little detour?

3638
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:09,200
If you insist.

3639
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:11,360
Let's find that goody two shoes.

3640
02:38:17,070 --> 02:38:19,910
Find the truth behind the mysterious flower person.

3641
02:38:22,970 --> 02:38:23,630
Hmm...

3642
02:38:25,230 --> 02:38:25,890
No!

3643
02:38:31,050 --> 02:38:33,670
I'm just gonna head to Forestland.

3644
02:38:34,810 --> 02:38:35,790
Okay, not...

3645
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:39,910
Okay, now I'm gonna head over.

3646
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:41,390
No!

3647
02:38:42,090 --> 02:38:43,050
Wait, wait, okay.

3648
02:38:43,050 --> 02:38:44,330
I'm gonna grab the...

3649
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:45,830
Okay, this time.

3650
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,650
I got the momentum!

3651
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:48,790
Yay!

3652
02:38:49,290 --> 02:38:50,570
I told you guys!

3653
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:51,710
Am I going the right way?

3654
02:38:51,970 --> 02:38:52,590
Oh no.

3655
02:38:52,870 --> 02:38:53,710
No, no, no, no, no!

3656
02:38:53,970 --> 02:38:55,690
Prince, we're sinking into the water.

3657
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:57,210
Okay, okay guys, this time.

3658
02:38:57,970 --> 02:38:58,750
This time.

3659
02:38:59,410 --> 02:38:59,930
Yeah!

3660
02:39:02,030 --> 02:39:02,790
There you go.

3661
02:39:03,010 --> 02:39:04,210
God fucking... Okay.

3662
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:05,850
Okay, alright.

3663
02:39:06,010 --> 02:39:08,330
After all that HP, you're right.

3664
02:39:08,430 --> 02:39:09,630
Maybe it doesn't work.

3665
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:12,830
Guys, maybe...

3666
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:13,030
Maybe it doesn't work.

3667
02:39:13,030 --> 02:39:15,930
Maybe Raul is right and it doesn't work, guys.

3668
02:39:18,610 --> 02:39:21,010
I just wanna do it faster!

3669
02:39:21,330 --> 02:39:24,070
But I didn't realize it wasn't that fast!

3670
02:39:25,870 --> 02:39:27,510
Wait, I have the hover bot.

3671
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:29,270
What the fuck am I doing?

3672
02:39:31,530 --> 02:39:32,130
Hover.

3673
02:39:34,310 --> 02:39:35,150
Toggle hover.

3674
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:35,990
Move.

3675
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:37,830
Shoot.

3676
02:39:37,990 --> 02:39:38,410
Okay.

3677
02:39:39,010 --> 02:39:40,170
What am I doing?

3678
02:39:40,310 --> 02:39:42,710
I have to literally have a car for this.

3679
02:39:44,650 --> 02:39:46,550
I'm just like, wait a minute.

3680
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:48,250
I literally have a car.

3681
02:39:48,650 --> 02:39:49,830
How do humans make a living?

3682
02:39:51,490 --> 02:39:53,930
Crafts, agriculture, hunting, trade.

3683
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:55,390
It's pretty varied.

3684
02:39:55,750 --> 02:39:58,670
And some bad eggs resort to thievery, of course.

3685
02:39:59,690 --> 02:40:02,310
We steal from humans sometimes too.

3686
02:40:03,010 --> 02:40:03,550
Yeah.

3687
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:05,250
That's nothing to be proud of.

3688
02:40:05,970 --> 02:40:08,530
Unless you're stealing from the army, that is.

3689
02:40:09,490 --> 02:40:10,730
Am I going the right way?

3690
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:12,390
I don't know.

3691
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:13,010
I'm just gonna head this way.

3692
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:16,010
But how do I get back up top though?

3693
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:18,150
Is that another city?

3694
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:21,570
Yeah, it is pretty slow.

3695
02:40:21,950 --> 02:40:25,410
I don't know if I'm going the right... I have to be going the right way though, right?

3696
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:28,950
I'm just like wondering, like, how do I get back up top?

3697
02:40:31,010 --> 02:40:32,630
Oh my god, it's so slow.

3698
02:40:33,430 --> 02:40:35,510
Wait, if I go here...

3699
02:40:37,830 --> 02:40:39,270
No, I think I should go this way.

3700
02:40:41,350 --> 02:40:42,570
Can't you fash... where?

3701
02:40:43,810 --> 02:40:44,330
How?

3702
02:40:44,950 --> 02:40:46,090
I'll just go this way.

3703
02:40:46,310 --> 02:40:48,690
This has to be a... this can't be that slow.

3704
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:54,830
Sounds like a problem for future Doki to worry about.

3705
02:40:56,890 --> 02:40:59,930
I think it's also because we're driving against the current.

3706
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:04,710
Okay.

3707
02:41:05,830 --> 02:41:08,650
I'm just gonna hope that there is some way to...

3708
02:41:08,650 --> 02:41:10,410
No, the boost is just...

3709
02:41:10,410 --> 02:41:13,010
You get to hover a little bit higher.

3710
02:41:13,010 --> 02:41:14,010
So like...

3711
02:41:15,790 --> 02:41:18,290
This is the... this is literally the boost.

3712
02:41:18,550 --> 02:41:22,130
I get to be like 2 centimeters above water.

3713
02:41:22,550 --> 02:41:25,210
Like just 2 centimeters, just a little bit above water.

3714
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:29,190
I hope...

3715
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:34,590
I can't... oh my god, I would be so sad if there is actually like no way to get up top.

3716
02:41:37,290 --> 02:41:40,210
Guys, this isn't looking too good right now.

3717
02:41:40,210 --> 02:41:41,930
I'm gonna hover explore all of Sand Land.

3718
02:41:45,310 --> 02:41:46,390
Wait, you're right.

3719
02:41:46,430 --> 02:41:47,030
What current?

3720
02:41:47,110 --> 02:41:47,670
I'm hovering.

3721
02:41:47,890 --> 02:41:48,670
Wait a minute.

3722
02:41:48,810 --> 02:41:49,510
You're right.

3723
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:53,490
I'm gonna trust...

3724
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:57,750
Oh god, please tell me there's a way to climb up this.

3725
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:03,700
No, there's no way.

3726
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:04,620
There's no way.

3727
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:05,960
There has to be a hole.

3728
02:42:06,040 --> 02:42:07,120
See, there's a hole there.

3729
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:10,900
Maybe this hole will lead up top.

3730
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:12,400
Maybe the grotto...

3731
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:12,980
You know what?

3732
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:15,620
But maybe the grotto will lead to a different hole.

3733
02:42:17,720 --> 02:42:19,820
Oh no, it's just ore.

3734
02:42:20,020 --> 02:42:20,440
It's bad.

3735
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:21,600
Free ore.

3736
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:23,640
Free ore, guys.

3737
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:27,520
I went here for the ore, okay guys?

3738
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:30,580
I did it for the ore.

3739
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:37,600
There has to be an entrance.

3740
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:38,500
There's no way.

3741
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:43,560
There has to be like a way to go up top.

3742
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,100
Guys, I bet you there's a way.

3743
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:55,240
There's a hole here.

3744
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:56,900
There's no way.

3745
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:58,540
Because there's no way.

3746
02:42:58,580 --> 02:43:00,100
There has to be a hole here.

3747
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:05,400
There's a hole, right?

3748
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:06,640
There's a hole, right?

3749
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:08,480
There's a hole, right?

3750
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:09,360
There has to be.

3751
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:13,780
There's no way they let me drive all the way here.

3752
02:43:15,620 --> 02:43:17,680
If there's a hole, there's a way.

3753
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:19,740
Please, I just...

3754
02:43:19,740 --> 02:43:22,380
All I want to be is in Forest Land.

3755
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:23,820
Please.

3756
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:30,660
What do you mean one day?

3757
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:34,300
What do you mean inaccessible spots one day?

3758
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:37,120
Wait, there's a hole!

3759
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:37,820
Wait, there's a hole!

3760
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:39,460
I fucking knew it.

3761
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:41,200
Guys, no.

3762
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:42,020
No.

3763
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:44,300
No.

3764
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:45,540
My ship.

3765
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:47,880
My ship is too short.

3766
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:51,620
There's no way.

3767
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:52,780
Oh, thank God.

3768
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:53,600
I knew it.

3769
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:55,420
I knew there was a hole.

3770
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:57,320
Nobody believed me.

3771
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:01,280
I knew there was a hole.

3772
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:03,040
Where?

3773
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:06,780
Where?

3774
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,700
Those are our tracks.

3775
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,420
I knew it.

3776
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:17,640
I knew it, guys.

3777
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:21,300
I knew there was always a way.

3778
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:24,080
We just gotta figure...

3779
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:24,220
Oh.

3780
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:26,120
Guys.

3781
02:44:26,980 --> 02:44:27,880
Is there...

3782
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:28,480
Oh, there is.

3783
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:29,240
There is a checkpoint.

3784
02:44:29,740 --> 02:44:30,300
Wait.

3785
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:31,700
Open up.

3786
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:33,560
What do you mean this door is closed?

3787
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,320
What do you mean?

3788
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:37,320
Guys.

3789
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:37,800
Guys.

3790
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:40,520
What do you mean the door is closed over there?

3791
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:41,020
No!

3792
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:43,780
Maybe we can go around.

3793
02:44:44,420 --> 02:44:46,800
Guys, we can go around, guys.

3794
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:47,920
Guys.

3795
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:50,020
What do you mean?

3796
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:52,820
I'm not supposed to be here.

3797
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:56,380
No!

3798
02:44:56,700 --> 02:45:00,360
I was never supposed to be here.

3799
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:02,600
No!

3800
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:02,880
No!

3801
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:07,780
Guys.

3802
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,860
Guys, how do I get across?

3803
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,020
My meal was not supposed to be here.

3804
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:23,740
No!

3805
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:28,080
Okay.

3806
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:30,560
We're gonna figure it out, guys.

3807
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:32,880
How the fuck?

3808
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:34,040
I'm not supposed to be here.

3809
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:38,220
Wait, if we go across here and then move here...

3810
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:38,440
Okay.

3811
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:40,400
I figured it out, guys.

3812
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:46,020
I figured it out.

3813
02:45:50,610 --> 02:45:51,650
Oh my God.

3814
02:45:51,730 --> 02:45:52,790
It's a rare one!

3815
02:45:54,810 --> 02:45:55,370
Wait.

3816
02:45:55,450 --> 02:45:57,370
That's a rare dinosaur that's endangered.

3817
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:03,190
I'm the reason why it's endangered.

3818
02:46:06,730 --> 02:46:08,570
I wanted to do that right.

3819
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:11,390
Alright.

3820
02:46:11,390 --> 02:46:12,110
This way.

3821
02:46:12,930 --> 02:46:13,650
This is it.

3822
02:46:13,690 --> 02:46:14,670
This is the other checkpoint.

3823
02:46:15,950 --> 02:46:16,570
Don't worry.

3824
02:46:16,650 --> 02:46:18,350
I got my passport ready, guys.

3825
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:19,930
Don't worry.

3826
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:23,430
I got my passport ready.

3827
02:46:25,930 --> 02:46:26,410
Yay!

3828
02:46:28,710 --> 02:46:29,190
Okay.

3829
02:46:29,770 --> 02:46:31,190
Guys, I should've went that way.

3830
02:46:31,710 --> 02:46:33,130
That was a lot faster.

3831
02:46:34,450 --> 02:46:35,550
Who would've thought?

3832
02:46:36,110 --> 02:46:38,390
Who would've thought that was the right way?

3833
02:46:38,390 --> 02:46:39,890
Wait, there's another city here?

3834
02:46:42,850 --> 02:46:44,250
Oh, that is not a city!

3835
02:46:44,450 --> 02:46:44,870
Goodbye!

3836
02:46:45,550 --> 02:46:46,310
Goodbye.

3837
02:46:49,470 --> 02:46:51,790
Sorry, that was definitely not another city.

3838
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:56,570
We're almost there.

3839
02:46:57,930 --> 02:47:01,230
Please, one cannot see forest land.

3840
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:08,150
For three parts, I've been baited about forest land.

3841
02:47:10,110 --> 02:47:11,450
I should be here.

3842
02:47:12,010 --> 02:47:15,330
It should be here.

3843
02:47:15,330 --> 02:47:17,250
Ooh, is he gonna get it?

3844
02:47:18,410 --> 02:47:19,670
Should be this way.

3845
02:47:22,070 --> 02:47:22,370
Okay.

3846
02:47:23,690 --> 02:47:25,850
God, my fucking gun is so...

3847
02:47:26,590 --> 02:47:27,190
weak!

3848
02:47:29,030 --> 02:47:30,870
Oh, it's underneath the water.

3849
02:47:31,030 --> 02:47:31,190
Oh!

3850
02:47:32,050 --> 02:47:32,650
Whoops.

3851
02:47:33,410 --> 02:47:34,010
Whoops.

3852
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:37,610
I almost forgot about the hover car.

3853
02:47:38,390 --> 02:47:40,430
It's okay, I got the hover car this time.

3854
02:47:41,290 --> 02:47:44,010
I'm sorry, I thought I could drive faster than the water!

3855
02:47:44,270 --> 02:47:46,410
Like those running lizards, you know?

3856
02:47:47,130 --> 02:47:48,230
Oh, it's another ruin.

3857
02:47:50,470 --> 02:47:53,810
I just thought it was those running lizards.

3858
02:47:54,250 --> 02:47:56,670
Where you run so fast you can run above water?

3859
02:47:59,250 --> 02:48:01,090
So I thought I could bike so fast.

3860
02:48:07,140 --> 02:48:08,900
Whoa, there's a swamp here.

3861
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:11,700
It's like mangroves.

3862
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:14,800
It's pretty.

3863
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:26,780
Is this a church?

3864
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:33,780
Oh no, is there a cross here?

3865
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:35,780
Oh no!

3866
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:39,580
Oh my god!

3867
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:41,380
Wait, what?

3868
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:42,580
Oh, it's holy water!

3869
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:45,780
I'm not supposed to touch it!

3870
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:48,680
It's literally holy water!

3871
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:51,580
Oh hey, there's loot.

3872
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:56,980
Finally, yeah, finally a dungeon that's not a factory, holy shit.

3873
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:00,440
Begone, demons!

3874
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:06,380
I was just thinking right now, I just thought about Inuyasha.

3875
02:49:06,700 --> 02:49:10,100
And you guys remember when they tried to make a sequel to Inuyasha?

3876
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:14,860
About like Inuyasha and Shishirinuru's kids?

3877
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:18,760
And then like people sort of, oh my god, there's a giant octopus?

3878
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:19,720
We're playing Zelda!

3879
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:22,820
And then like people sort of like forgot about it.

3880
02:49:23,540 --> 02:49:25,380
Apparently that show didn't do so well either.

3881
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:26,320
So like, no wonder.

3882
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,380
Oh no, this is a puzzle?

3883
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:34,520
A puzzle?

3884
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:38,820
I didn't watch it, so I don't know.

3885
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:41,800
A puzzle?

3886
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,880
Wait, no, there's like... no it's not.

3887
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:48,200
We just walk up.

3888
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:51,360
How bad was it?

3889
02:49:51,380 --> 02:49:52,560
I don't know, I never watched it.

3890
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:58,720
I always know like whenever they make like... usually whenever like they use Bank of Nostalgia...

3891
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:01,440
It's... oh my god, what a puzzle.

3892
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:06,480
Holy shit, the puzzle of the century.

3893
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:11,220
Okay.

3894
02:50:11,980 --> 02:50:17,260
But like usually whenever a show banks on nostalgia on like sequels and stuff, it's usually not good.

3895
02:50:18,340 --> 02:50:22,380
Like I mean, did you guys see the new Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends sequel?

3896
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:23,560
That's gonna come out.

3897
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:28,480
The graphics for that shit looks... really, really bad.

3898
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:34,680
It's a water temple.

3899
02:50:36,740 --> 02:50:38,120
I'm too lazy to get off.

3900
02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:38,460
No!

3901
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:41,480
I always have too lazy to get off the car!

3902
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:44,380
Wait, we weren't supposed to be here?

3903
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:46,620
Oh no, it's this way.

3904
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:47,860
I didn't see the other door.

3905
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:53,020
Oh my god.

3906
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:55,380
I'm a mess right now.

3907
02:50:57,540 --> 02:50:59,160
Is this where I'm supposed to be?

3908
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:01,260
Where is this?

3909
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:05,060
Where am I?

3910
02:51:06,780 --> 02:51:08,340
Where the fuck am I?

3911
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:14,660
Yeah, they're planning on making a sequel for Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.

3912
02:51:17,320 --> 02:51:18,580
But like, what is it?

3913
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:19,580
Foster's Fun... yeah.

3914
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:22,540
Foster's Fun Time for Imaginary Friends.

3915
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:24,000
It's a preschool cartoon?

3916
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:26,260
That's when you know...

3917
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:27,500
What's his name?

3918
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:29,360
Craig had like nothing to do with it.

3919
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:36,300
Because like, I don't think...

3920
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:38,400
There's no way he has anything...

3921
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:42,200
Like Craig had anything to do with the preschool version.

3922
02:51:43,020 --> 02:51:44,400
I don't think so.

3923
02:51:44,500 --> 02:51:51,220
I don't think he would like willingly make a preschool version of the show.

3924
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:57,890
There's a kids version of Total Drama Island?

3925
02:51:58,270 --> 02:51:59,010
Holy shit.

3926
02:51:59,210 --> 02:51:59,690
That's...

3927
02:52:01,450 --> 02:52:02,610
That's like...

3928
02:52:03,790 --> 02:52:08,210
That's like against like the whole premise of Total Drama!

3929
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:10,110
I've actually never...

3930
02:52:10,990 --> 02:52:13,030
I've never watched Total Drama Island.

3931
02:52:13,550 --> 02:52:14,330
Confession time.

3932
02:52:15,090 --> 02:52:16,990
I've never watched Total Drama Island.

3933
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:17,450
What's that?

3934
02:52:24,470 --> 02:52:26,210
I think like... I don't know.

3935
02:52:26,210 --> 02:52:28,690
I just never played on TV when I...

3936
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:30,270
Oh, that's a big crocodile!

3937
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:31,890
Oh, well okay.

3938
02:52:32,010 --> 02:52:32,930
That's a dead crocodile.

3939
02:52:33,030 --> 02:52:33,610
Never mind.

3940
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:34,770
Alright.

3941
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:36,030
Yay!

3942
02:52:36,650 --> 02:52:39,330
Should have evolved into anti-tank.

3943
02:52:40,830 --> 02:52:43,210
You know the world, what the world was like.

3944
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:46,970
If you don't evolve and adapt, you get the kill.

3945
02:52:54,270 --> 02:52:55,650
Alright, I think it was this way?

3946
02:52:56,710 --> 02:53:01,070
I'm like a bit lost right now because I get disoriented so easily.

3947
02:53:02,650 --> 02:53:03,810
Has to be this way.

3948
02:53:03,950 --> 02:53:04,430
Yeah.

3949
02:53:04,810 --> 02:53:05,650
Holy shit!

3950
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:06,630
That's another big crocodile.

3951
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:07,370
It's okay.

3952
02:53:07,470 --> 02:53:08,690
My guns are so strong.

3953
02:53:10,530 --> 02:53:11,050
Yay!

3954
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:16,760
And then up we go.

3955
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:20,800
Nice.

3956
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:24,100
It's good that I don't have to get off the car.

3957
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:27,180
What the thing is...

3958
02:53:27,730 --> 02:53:33,820
Like the thing about like... It's crazy to think about but like a lot of like British shows, they don't get sequels.

3959
02:53:34,300 --> 02:53:35,240
They just end.

3960
02:53:36,300 --> 02:53:45,120
I don't know why but a lot of British TV shows and like cartoons or whatever, they usually just end it after...

3961
02:53:45,770 --> 02:53:47,260
After like one or two seasons.

3962
02:53:47,260 --> 02:53:50,340
And like they usually have like you know five or six episodes.

3963
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:54,340
They don't usually like prolong it like American syndications.

3964
02:53:56,540 --> 02:53:58,280
Yeah, and then they get an American version.

3965
02:53:58,520 --> 02:53:59,240
That's so true.

3966
02:54:00,220 --> 02:54:03,200
And then they get an American version that has like 800 seasons.

3967
02:54:08,030 --> 02:54:09,650
Wallace and Gromit get a movie?

3968
02:54:09,870 --> 02:54:11,010
Yeah, but do you guys hear?

3969
02:54:12,690 --> 02:54:17,350
Claymation... The art form of Claymation is like might die out.

3970
02:54:17,350 --> 02:54:22,090
Because the main factory that makes Claymation clay...

3971
02:54:24,350 --> 02:54:25,050
Closed down.

3972
02:54:28,150 --> 02:54:29,650
I don't know if you guys heard about it.

3973
02:54:29,990 --> 02:54:37,410
It was like a news a while ago but the main factory that makes like Claymation clay closed down.

3974
02:54:37,950 --> 02:54:44,450
Because like I don't know if it was like the creators of it was too old and they don't know who to pass it down or something.

3975
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:47,450
Or like it was just not worth manufacturing.

3976
02:54:50,390 --> 02:54:51,410
Was that false?

3977
02:54:51,730 --> 02:54:52,850
I thought it was...

3978
02:54:54,210 --> 02:55:00,430
Yeah, the studios are working off... I just heard... I heard like the studio bought like a stockpile of it.

3979
02:55:00,570 --> 02:55:03,170
Yeah, they bought up all the remaining...

3980
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:08,930
The remaining stock of the Claymation clay.

3981
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:15,470
It's like a super specific... Yeah, it's like a super specific kind of clay.

3982
02:55:15,610 --> 02:55:17,210
It happened before with chalk.

3983
02:55:17,450 --> 02:55:18,050
With like...

3984
02:55:18,050 --> 02:55:19,130
Math professors.

3985
02:55:20,390 --> 02:55:29,310
With like math professors and chalk because there's like a very specific chalk that professor use for classes.

3986
02:55:29,470 --> 02:55:31,270
Because it's like the best kind of chalk.

3987
02:55:31,690 --> 02:55:33,190
And then like the...

3988
02:55:35,070 --> 02:55:39,190
Originally the factory, the creator, the formula was just gonna close down.

3989
02:55:39,930 --> 02:55:43,330
Was just gonna close down because they didn't have like a successor to it.

3990
02:55:43,550 --> 02:55:46,310
Yeah, very very specific Japanese chalk.

3991
02:55:46,910 --> 02:55:48,030
And they were originally gonna...

3992
02:55:48,030 --> 02:55:51,810
They were originally going to like just close down and like have the formula die with him.

3993
02:55:52,030 --> 02:55:55,470
But then he found like a super passionate like math professor.

3994
02:55:55,690 --> 02:55:58,290
A very passionate nerd about...

3995
02:55:58,290 --> 02:56:00,850
About like math like chalk in general.

3996
02:56:00,970 --> 02:56:04,670
So then he like passed down the formula and also like the factory.

3997
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:06,290
To like...

3998
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,230
Because like you need...

3999
02:56:07,230 --> 02:56:11,350
Apparently you need like a very specific like equipment to make the chalk.

4000
02:56:11,590 --> 02:56:14,030
So like and only his factory...

4001
02:56:14,630 --> 02:56:16,890
Only his factory can produce it.

4002
02:56:16,890 --> 02:56:20,510
So like originally he had like his children didn't want to continue...

4003
02:56:20,510 --> 02:56:22,910
His children didn't want to continue the legacy.

4004
02:56:23,090 --> 02:56:25,390
Because you know they're like we want to do other things dad.

4005
02:56:25,510 --> 02:56:26,370
We don't want to be...

4006
02:56:26,790 --> 02:56:27,570
We don't...

4007
02:56:27,570 --> 02:56:28,470
Oh my god stop!

4008
02:56:29,210 --> 02:56:29,610
Stop!

4009
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:30,450
This is why I'm...

4010
02:56:30,450 --> 02:56:32,710
This is why I have a tank.

4011
02:56:33,230 --> 02:56:36,050
But like his kids didn't want to continue the legacy.

4012
02:56:36,250 --> 02:56:38,110
Because you know they're like I don't want to be a professor.

4013
02:56:40,390 --> 02:56:42,550
I don't want to be a nerd.

4014
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:43,910
So then...

4015
02:56:44,630 --> 02:56:45,030
What?

4016
02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:46,070
What do you mean not a good...

4017
02:56:46,070 --> 02:56:47,630
Oh I had to wear stairs in front of me.

4018
02:56:47,930 --> 02:56:48,410
Okay.

4019
02:56:49,230 --> 02:56:49,710
What?

4020
02:56:49,790 --> 02:56:50,450
What do you mean?

4021
02:56:51,790 --> 02:56:53,510
Let me have my hover car!

4022
02:56:54,130 --> 02:56:54,890
Here we go.

4023
02:56:55,450 --> 02:56:56,710
Why can't I call this?

4024
02:56:59,390 --> 02:56:59,870
Okay.

4025
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:01,870
Yeah it's the...

4026
02:57:01,870 --> 02:57:03,370
Wait it's the best...

4027
02:57:03,370 --> 02:57:06,890
Okay I did not hear about the best tasting chalk of all time.

4028
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:10,770
I know it's like the best chalk in the world.

4029
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:14,690
But yeah so like they had that issue but then they found the successor.

4030
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:17,790
I think like from a math professor in Korea.

4031
02:57:18,370 --> 02:57:18,850
Right?

4032
02:57:19,730 --> 02:57:21,190
And then he like...

4033
02:57:21,190 --> 02:57:26,670
He like gave him like the fact like the equipment to make the chalk and stuff.

4034
02:57:26,750 --> 02:57:28,030
And then he's gonna continue...

4035
02:57:28,030 --> 02:57:29,610
He's gonna continue the legacy.

4036
02:57:32,430 --> 02:57:33,630
Which is pretty cool.

4037
02:57:33,810 --> 02:57:35,390
I thought that was really interesting.

4038
02:57:36,710 --> 02:57:39,270
So yeah that's basically what's happening with Claymation.

4039
02:57:39,370 --> 02:57:41,090
I don't know if they actually...

4040
02:57:41,090 --> 02:57:42,910
If they like actually...

4041
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:46,170
What is it called?

4042
02:57:46,290 --> 02:57:50,570
They like found a successor to make the clay now.

4043
02:57:50,850 --> 02:57:52,410
Because like just like Claymation.

4044
02:57:52,570 --> 02:57:53,970
It's a very specific clay.

4045
02:57:55,730 --> 02:57:56,290
That...

4046
02:57:57,130 --> 02:57:59,410
It's a very very specific clay for it.

4047
02:58:01,150 --> 02:58:06,490
Like I remember like studios were freaking out and buying all the remaining clay from the factory.

4048
02:58:09,230 --> 02:58:10,370
I hope so too.

4049
02:58:10,430 --> 02:58:12,050
I really like Claymation in general.

4050
02:58:15,230 --> 02:58:16,870
It looks awfully deep.

4051
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:18,450
Let's use the hovercraft.

4052
02:58:18,850 --> 02:58:21,270
I've been using the hovercraft this entire time.

4053
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:21,950
What do you mean?

4054
02:58:22,210 --> 02:58:23,730
Let's use the hovercraft.

4055
02:58:27,010 --> 02:58:28,990
I'll get rid of the crocodile population.

4056
02:58:30,230 --> 02:58:34,150
Guys by killing the crocodiles only the strongest can survive.

4057
02:58:34,370 --> 02:58:36,230
And then they will adapt to the future.

4058
02:58:38,930 --> 02:58:40,270
They can live on.

4059
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:46,040
Oh hey nice.

4060
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:47,020
There was a lover.

4061
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:49,120
This better be the last lover.

4062
02:58:50,420 --> 02:58:51,580
I hope so too.

4063
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:53,960
I hope so too Bells.

4064
02:58:54,760 --> 02:58:55,900
Where did my car go?

4065
02:58:56,080 --> 02:58:56,720
Oh there it is.

4066
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:01,120
Okay.

4067
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:07,700
Yeah I'm giving the Crux immunity to the missiles guys.

4068
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:10,340
I'm helping the environment.

4069
02:59:13,740 --> 02:59:17,380
I'm making it so that they will be immune to missiles in the future.

4070
02:59:18,620 --> 02:59:21,500
So their descendants will like evolve.

4071
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:27,800
I mean yeah you're right they already evolved to survive asteroids.

4072
02:59:28,580 --> 02:59:30,860
Now they can evolve to survive missiles.

4073
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:32,820
Is that what we wanted?

4074
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:39,280
Any thoughts for the upcoming King of the Hill sequel?

4075
02:59:39,280 --> 02:59:42,060
I don't know how the fuck they're gonna be able to replace Bobby.

4076
02:59:42,640 --> 02:59:43,520
Rest in peace.

4077
02:59:45,820 --> 02:59:46,620
I don't know.

4078
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:47,320
I don't know.

4079
02:59:47,400 --> 02:59:50,060
It's gonna be a weird scene King of the Hill being like digital art.

4080
02:59:50,220 --> 02:59:51,760
I feel like a lot of...

4081
02:59:52,660 --> 02:59:53,140
Um...

4082
02:59:53,140 --> 02:59:56,040
I feel like a lot of shows...

4083
02:59:56,040 --> 02:59:57,880
The shows that they reboot...

4084
02:59:58,720 --> 03:00:01,700
Lose it's charm because they go like full digital animation.

4085
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:03,240
It's not...

4086
03:00:03,240 --> 03:00:05,940
It feels so weird compared to like...

4087
03:00:06,460 --> 03:00:06,940
Um...

4088
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:08,680
Maybe I can't call the ride here.

4089
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:13,080
Feels weird compared to like...

4090
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,440
Like uh...

4091
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:15,480
You know Cell...

4092
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:16,720
What was it called?

4093
03:00:17,860 --> 03:00:18,860
Cell animation?

4094
03:00:19,820 --> 03:00:23,540
It's like every time like an old show...

4095
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:28,060
Like when an old show gets rebooted or like confirmed the sequel.

4096
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:33,180
And they change like animation techniques and stuff.

4097
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:34,700
It just feels off.

4098
03:00:36,440 --> 03:00:38,440
Key animation was a Cell...

4099
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:39,060
Uh...

4100
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:39,620
Yeah.

4101
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:43,640
They have to recast a lot of people too.

4102
03:00:43,700 --> 03:00:44,280
That's the thing.

4103
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:45,800
I am so lost.

4104
03:00:46,320 --> 03:00:48,660
I am so lost.

4105
03:00:55,030 --> 03:00:55,830
That's what I'm saying.

4106
03:00:55,990 --> 03:00:57,710
Like they have to replace some voice actors.

4107
03:00:57,790 --> 03:00:59,950
Because you know some of them passed away.

4108
03:01:05,580 --> 03:01:06,060
Ah!

4109
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:06,880
Oh okay.

4110
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:07,680
Summit down.

4111
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:08,500
Okay I'll summit here.

4112
03:01:10,220 --> 03:01:10,700
Uh...

4113
03:01:14,980 --> 03:01:15,700
Oh yeah.

4114
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:17,340
No the Powerpuff Girl reboot.

4115
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:19,480
That shit was fucking wild.

4116
03:01:19,740 --> 03:01:20,480
Oh my god.

4117
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:20,800
Okay.

4118
03:01:20,880 --> 03:01:24,640
There was this whole controversy about that guy.

4119
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:28,480
People were like oh my god he did a self insert.

4120
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:30,560
And inserted himself into a Powerpuff Girl.

4121
03:01:30,980 --> 03:01:31,460
Into the...

4122
03:01:31,460 --> 03:01:32,580
But that was like...

4123
03:01:32,580 --> 03:01:33,920
Apparently that was a lie.

4124
03:01:34,440 --> 03:01:35,840
If you guys didn't know.

4125
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:37,640
He didn't even...

4126
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:37,980
He...

4127
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:43,720
Like the other staff members inserted him as a joke.

4128
03:01:45,460 --> 03:01:47,020
And so he didn't...

4129
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:47,380
He...

4130
03:01:47,780 --> 03:01:48,080
Yeah!

4131
03:01:48,580 --> 03:01:49,180
Yes!

4132
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:52,720
Like apparently he didn't even want it to be like in the show.

4133
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:54,320
Like one of the writers.

4134
03:01:54,420 --> 03:01:57,700
And like apparently like one of the animation team.

4135
03:01:58,480 --> 03:01:59,080
Uh...

4136
03:01:59,080 --> 03:02:02,340
Yeah his friends did that without telling him.

4137
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:04,380
Which was fucking crazy.

4138
03:02:05,540 --> 03:02:10,540
Cause like everyone thought he like inserted himself like he wanted it.

4139
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:12,080
Uh...

4140
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:15,800
People thought that like he was doing a self insert.

4141
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:18,500
And was like laughing at him and stuff about it.

4142
03:02:18,540 --> 03:02:20,600
Being like wow I can't believe you self insert.

4143
03:02:20,880 --> 03:02:22,540
And apparently it was just like a prank.

4144
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:23,560
Apparently.

4145
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:28,740
But everybody like spread the rumor being like wow he self inserted himself.

4146
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:31,540
That's so creepy.

4147
03:02:33,320 --> 03:02:35,600
And that story was a lie.

4148
03:02:35,820 --> 03:02:37,860
It was a lie this entire time.

4149
03:02:38,820 --> 03:02:40,120
Why was it creepy?

4150
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:41,420
Because he was like...

4151
03:02:41,420 --> 03:02:44,160
He made that self insert like the...

4152
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:45,180
Um...

4153
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:48,560
Like made that self insert Blossom's crush.

4154
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:51,060
So people were like wow that's so creepy.

4155
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:55,680
Making yourself a self insert and then making Blossom crush on you.

4156
03:02:56,100 --> 03:02:56,660
Wow.

4157
03:02:57,200 --> 03:03:00,920
And then like the guy, the writer finally came out and was like...

4158
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:02,340
I didn't even know I was...

4159
03:03:05,620 --> 03:03:07,000
They were like...

4160
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:10,100
He was like I didn't even want to...

4161
03:03:10,100 --> 03:03:12,320
I didn't even ask for this.

4162
03:03:12,360 --> 03:03:14,820
They inserted me there without telling me.

4163
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:23,040
So his reputation actually got fucked over as a joke.

4164
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:26,440
Oh my god.

4165
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:27,680
It was actually crazy.

4166
03:03:32,140 --> 03:03:33,460
It's just a joke.

4167
03:03:33,500 --> 03:03:34,920
A joke in question.

4168
03:03:39,210 --> 03:03:41,890
Because everyone thought he like put it...

4169
03:03:41,890 --> 03:03:43,050
Put himself in there.

4170
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:44,270
Himself.

4171
03:03:45,210 --> 03:03:46,530
That was like the biggest joke.

4172
03:03:46,530 --> 03:03:47,910
The biggest plot twist of my life.

4173
03:03:50,130 --> 03:03:50,530
Alright.

4174
03:03:50,750 --> 03:03:51,330
Oh my god.

4175
03:03:51,430 --> 03:03:51,910
What is this?

4176
03:03:52,930 --> 03:03:54,090
Oh I can jump this.

4177
03:03:54,450 --> 03:03:54,850
Yay!

4178
03:03:56,270 --> 03:03:58,170
I can just ride across it.

4179
03:03:58,250 --> 03:03:59,970
Because it's like a little podium.

4180
03:04:00,950 --> 03:04:01,350
Yeah.

4181
03:04:01,370 --> 03:04:01,870
I don't even know...

4182
03:04:03,450 --> 03:04:03,850
Guys.

4183
03:04:04,070 --> 03:04:04,750
I should have jumped.

4184
03:04:05,970 --> 03:04:07,270
I got too cocky.

4185
03:04:08,490 --> 03:04:10,250
I got a little too cocky.

4186
03:04:10,750 --> 03:04:11,630
Dr. Cranberry.

4187
03:04:11,750 --> 03:04:12,510
Thank you for the super chat.

4188
03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:12,810
Thank you.

4189
03:04:12,830 --> 03:04:13,370
Thank you.

4190
03:04:13,370 --> 03:04:24,230
The problem with media nowadays is nobody wants to invest in a risky venture which means we get less original project which increases remakes and sequels instead of original risky shows and games.

4191
03:04:24,470 --> 03:04:25,250
Thank you for the super chat.

4192
03:04:25,330 --> 03:04:25,570
Thank you.

4193
03:04:25,610 --> 03:04:25,930
Thank you.

4194
03:04:26,010 --> 03:04:26,210
Yeah.

4195
03:04:26,250 --> 03:04:26,710
No but...

4196
03:04:27,870 --> 03:04:29,710
The board doesn't want...

4197
03:04:29,710 --> 03:04:31,090
Why did I...

4198
03:04:31,870 --> 03:04:32,310
Guys.

4199
03:04:32,390 --> 03:04:33,170
I did not learn.

4200
03:04:33,810 --> 03:04:34,250
Guys.

4201
03:04:34,290 --> 03:04:34,990
I didn't learn.

4202
03:04:35,070 --> 03:04:35,410
Guys.

4203
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:36,070
I didn't...

4204
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:40,190
Okay.

4205
03:04:40,290 --> 03:04:41,090
I need to get off the car.

4206
03:04:41,250 --> 03:04:42,110
I'm not learning.

4207
03:04:42,110 --> 03:04:42,310
I'm not learning.

4208
03:04:42,630 --> 03:04:43,230
I'm not learning.

4209
03:04:43,230 --> 03:04:43,950
I'm not learning.

4210
03:04:43,950 --> 03:04:44,690
That's true.

4211
03:04:44,870 --> 03:05:01,710
Because it's just safer to bank on nostalgia than it is to risk creating a new IP which sucks because honestly we need new IP because things are getting really stale with just...

4212
03:05:01,710 --> 03:05:04,790
I mean I heard the new Star Wars sequel is really fucking...

4213
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:05,530
Not Star Wars.

4214
03:05:05,530 --> 03:05:07,330
The Star Wars spinoff.

4215
03:05:07,370 --> 03:05:08,590
Was it the ASA whatever?

4216
03:05:09,590 --> 03:05:11,770
Was really really bad.

4217
03:05:14,130 --> 03:05:16,290
So like it makes sense you know.

4218
03:05:20,420 --> 03:05:22,840
Oh thank you so much for the 10 ships.

4219
03:05:23,060 --> 03:05:23,380
Thank you.

4220
03:05:23,380 --> 03:05:24,120
Thank you.

4221
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:25,920
I really appreciate it.

4222
03:05:26,140 --> 03:05:27,220
Oh there's another lever.

4223
03:05:31,700 --> 03:05:33,520
And then like Pixar made...

4224
03:05:33,520 --> 03:05:33,740
Okay.

4225
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:34,600
You know what's funny?

4226
03:05:34,900 --> 03:05:35,380
Pixar...

4227
03:05:35,380 --> 03:05:37,680
I don't know if you guys saw the newest statement made by Pixar.

4228
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:42,620
But Pixar made a statement like I think like this week where they were like guys...

4229
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:43,980
Guys.

4230
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:46,560
Like we're not gonna do live action.

4231
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:47,700
I'm like...

4232
03:05:48,420 --> 03:05:48,740
What?

4233
03:05:52,480 --> 03:05:54,420
Like why would you...

4234
03:05:55,500 --> 03:05:58,380
Why do you need to make that statement?

4235
03:05:58,520 --> 03:05:59,900
You're Pixar.

4236
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:12,340
So I think like apparently Disney is trying like the Disney execs are trying to pressure Pixar into doing live action or something.

4237
03:06:12,480 --> 03:06:13,820
And I'm like why?

4238
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:15,840
They're Pixar.

4239
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:18,620
Why would they need to do...

4240
03:06:18,620 --> 03:06:21,140
Yeah no one expected them to.

4241
03:06:21,420 --> 03:06:22,320
So I got...

4242
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,160
I was like confused.

4243
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:26,860
I was like why does Pixar need to make that statement?

4244
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:30,040
Who expects them to do live action?

4245
03:06:32,740 --> 03:06:37,180
Yeah they aren't doing live action but they're doing 500,000.

4246
03:06:37,540 --> 03:06:37,920
Wait.

4247
03:06:38,060 --> 03:06:40,280
Oh I was like why is there boss music?

4248
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:41,800
Oh that's why.

4249
03:06:42,020 --> 03:06:42,220
Oh!

4250
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,180
That's a big crocodile.

4251
03:06:45,560 --> 03:06:49,080
I was like who expects you to do live action?

4252
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:51,040
At least that was sort of fun.

4253
03:06:51,400 --> 03:06:56,560
So I think it's like Disney must have tried to pressure them to do like live action or something.

4254
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:59,200
Because who expects them to do live action?

4255
03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:00,540
It's Pixar.

4256
03:07:05,440 --> 03:07:08,920
Disney making live action of all their existing properties.

4257
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:10,480
Yeah that's...

4258
03:07:10,480 --> 03:07:11,240
That's...

4259
03:07:11,240 --> 03:07:14,040
The thing is some of those movies do really well.

4260
03:07:15,500 --> 03:07:17,400
Like not in America.

4261
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:24,520
How many fucking levers do I have to turn on?

4262
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:27,820
Oh there it is.

4263
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:30,000
Did you guys know there's a...

4264
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:34,320
Did you guys know?

4265
03:07:34,860 --> 03:07:36,820
Okay so you know how there's like a...

4266
03:07:36,820 --> 03:07:38,720
A Lilo and Stitch series?

4267
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:39,980
Okay not Lilo and Stitch.

4268
03:07:40,060 --> 03:07:41,000
Sorry Stitch series.

4269
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:43,160
In Japan right?

4270
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:48,460
I just found out there's a Stitch series like based in China.

4271
03:07:48,940 --> 03:07:51,340
I was so surprised because like...

4272
03:07:51,340 --> 03:07:53,880
Like that was not like public knowledge.

4273
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:56,060
And like...

4274
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:57,320
For like people.

4275
03:07:57,440 --> 03:07:59,320
I just found out about it.

4276
03:07:59,620 --> 03:08:00,680
Hey check this out.

4277
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:04,560
Yeah there's a Stitch series and it's just like based in China.

4278
03:08:04,920 --> 03:08:06,360
There's something here.

4279
03:08:06,680 --> 03:08:08,360
Something round.

4280
03:08:09,780 --> 03:08:11,720
Not another urn is it?

4281
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:13,280
Ugh.

4282
03:08:13,940 --> 03:08:14,760
It's you.

4283
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:16,320
Yeah it was made...

4284
03:08:16,320 --> 03:08:17,280
Okay so like the...

4285
03:08:17,820 --> 03:08:21,900
Okay let's go through this plot and then I'll tell you guys the origin of it.

4286
03:08:25,660 --> 03:08:26,220
Okay.

4287
03:08:26,400 --> 03:08:28,040
So like...

4288
03:08:29,420 --> 03:08:29,980
Hmm.

4289
03:08:32,180 --> 03:08:33,260
The Lilo...

4290
03:08:33,260 --> 03:08:37,180
The Stitch series in Japan was not made by the Disney company.

4291
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:40,000
It was made by like Madhouse or something.

4292
03:08:40,820 --> 03:08:44,500
It was made by famous Japanese like animation company.

4293
03:08:44,500 --> 03:08:46,100
Because they wanted to like...

4294
03:08:46,100 --> 03:08:48,380
You know do the licensing for Stitch.

4295
03:08:50,140 --> 03:08:51,000
And then...

4296
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:51,780
So there...

4297
03:08:51,780 --> 03:08:57,500
The Stitch series based in China was made by the original...

4298
03:08:59,520 --> 03:09:00,000
Was...

4299
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,320
I think was it Madhouse or am I saying it wrong?

4300
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:04,160
It was like one of the bigger...

4301
03:09:04,160 --> 03:09:07,940
One of the bigger Japanese animation companies.

4302
03:09:08,380 --> 03:09:09,220
And it was...

4303
03:09:09,220 --> 03:09:09,920
Was it Madhouse?

4304
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:10,880
I don't remember.

4305
03:09:10,920 --> 03:09:11,860
Can someone fact check me?

4306
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:14,480
I'm talking about the Stitch animation company.

4307
03:09:14,480 --> 03:09:15,260
The Stitch animation series.

4308
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:19,160
Someone can fact check me.

4309
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:19,980
You guys have the internet.

4310
03:09:25,380 --> 03:09:26,800
Everyone's like Madhouse for real?

4311
03:09:27,020 --> 03:09:27,480
Okay so...

4312
03:09:27,480 --> 03:09:28,480
Yeah okay it is.

4313
03:09:28,600 --> 03:09:28,760
Okay.

4314
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:30,620
Yeah it was a licensing...

4315
03:09:30,620 --> 03:09:32,440
Yeah okay someone fact checked.

4316
03:09:32,580 --> 03:09:32,860
Okay yeah.

4317
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:33,560
It was a...

4318
03:09:33,560 --> 03:09:34,060
I was right.

4319
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:34,460
Okay.

4320
03:09:34,700 --> 03:09:35,600
It was a...

4321
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:38,400
They had a licensing agreement with Madhouse.

4322
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:41,820
Because Madhouse wanted to make a Stitch series.

4323
03:09:42,120 --> 03:09:43,880
Because like Stitch was like super popular in Japan.

4324
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:44,220
Yeah.

4325
03:09:46,600 --> 03:09:47,420
So...

4326
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:56,400
But then the China version was made by the original animation studio for the Lilo & Stitch series.

4327
03:09:57,720 --> 03:09:59,480
Very funny Grains.

4328
03:09:59,700 --> 03:10:01,320
That's just a drainage channel.

4329
03:10:02,220 --> 03:10:04,700
But it'll be a really fun ride, right?

4330
03:10:07,140 --> 03:10:08,780
Absolutely not!

4331
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:09,700
Yeah.

4332
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:11,000
Like the original...

4333
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:11,340
The...

4334
03:10:11,340 --> 03:10:14,440
And they got the original director for Lilo and Stitch.

4335
03:10:14,700 --> 03:10:16,120
Like the TV show series.

4336
03:10:16,420 --> 03:10:17,360
And the movies.

4337
03:10:17,640 --> 03:10:21,980
Like the Leroy and Stitch, the very first Lilo and Stitch movie.

4338
03:10:22,680 --> 03:10:25,180
I mean the second Lilo and Stitch movie.

4339
03:10:25,420 --> 03:10:26,300
And everything.

4340
03:10:27,780 --> 03:10:30,420
They actually got the original director.

4341
03:10:30,820 --> 03:10:34,080
To make the version based in China.

4342
03:10:34,420 --> 03:10:36,100
And I was so surprised.

4343
03:10:36,100 --> 03:10:41,140
Because I never heard about the version based in China.

4344
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:45,040
I literally found out this week because it showed up in my recommended.

4345
03:10:45,640 --> 03:10:46,700
Because I was like, what?

4346
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:50,500
It was apparently only shown in...

4347
03:10:50,500 --> 03:10:50,880
Oh wait.

4348
03:10:51,220 --> 03:10:52,240
Oh I have to hover.

4349
03:10:52,380 --> 03:10:52,620
Whoops.

4350
03:10:52,760 --> 03:10:55,040
Oh that's what the hover feature was for!

4351
03:10:59,260 --> 03:11:01,760
Like everybody knows the Japanese version.

4352
03:11:03,160 --> 03:11:04,840
And everybody knows the English...

4353
03:11:04,840 --> 03:11:05,920
You know, of course everybody knows.

4354
03:11:06,100 --> 03:11:06,660
The English version.

4355
03:11:08,960 --> 03:11:11,760
So I was like, I just found out about it.

4356
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:12,560
And it was like...

4357
03:11:12,940 --> 03:11:15,760
That the series released like in 2017!

4358
03:11:17,280 --> 03:11:18,000
Oh god.

4359
03:11:18,120 --> 03:11:18,380
Whoops.

4360
03:11:18,580 --> 03:11:18,820
Alright.

4361
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:19,480
It doesn't matter.

4362
03:11:19,580 --> 03:11:20,600
Wait, I don't even lose HP.

4363
03:11:20,800 --> 03:11:21,700
Like what does it matter?

4364
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:26,080
Okay, I know about the Powerpuff Girls.

4365
03:11:30,260 --> 03:11:33,320
I knew about the Powerpuff Girls anime.

4366
03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:37,420
Which is funny because in the Powerpuff Girls anime, they're not even siblings.

4367
03:11:37,560 --> 03:11:39,760
It's just a magical girl anime.

4368
03:11:40,160 --> 03:11:42,680
And it's like three random girls.

4369
03:11:43,260 --> 03:11:45,660
And Professor Utonium has a fucking son.

4370
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:50,600
Yeah, I like PPG's Z.

4371
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:52,340
Powerpuff Girls Z was good.

4372
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,120
I watched it.

4373
03:11:55,260 --> 03:11:56,120
Of course I watched it.

4374
03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:56,780
It was a really good show.

4375
03:12:01,880 --> 03:12:03,460
Oh my god, is it a giant crocodile?

4376
03:12:15,900 --> 03:12:17,320
It has to be a boss.

4377
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:18,340
It looks like a boss.

4378
03:12:27,190 --> 03:12:28,270
Is it a giant octopus?

4379
03:12:28,830 --> 03:12:31,110
Oh, it has to be a giant octopus because of the shrine!

4380
03:12:32,430 --> 03:12:33,310
With horns!

4381
03:12:37,930 --> 03:12:40,870
God, I love the 3D models for this game though.

4382
03:12:41,070 --> 03:12:42,690
I love how it's just based...

4383
03:12:42,690 --> 03:12:46,350
Like the Toriyama style is just so noticeable.

4384
03:12:51,710 --> 03:12:52,690
Oh, it's a squid!

4385
03:12:54,510 --> 03:12:55,930
It's looking this way.

4386
03:12:58,010 --> 03:12:58,530
Oops.

4387
03:12:58,650 --> 03:12:59,570
We're cornered.

4388
03:13:05,950 --> 03:13:06,890
Forget it!

4389
03:13:06,950 --> 03:13:08,230
Let me handle this!

4390
03:13:10,950 --> 03:13:12,710
Alright, let me handle this.

4391
03:13:12,710 --> 03:13:13,990
I say as I just...

4392
03:13:13,990 --> 03:13:15,430
Wait, can I summon Rao?

4393
03:13:15,750 --> 03:13:17,210
Put that tank in there!

4394
03:13:19,730 --> 03:13:20,250
Nice.

4395
03:13:20,330 --> 03:13:21,510
Doesn't really matter.

4396
03:13:21,790 --> 03:13:23,430
Oh, yeah, if I take it out, friends.

4397
03:13:24,730 --> 03:13:25,250
Nice.

4398
03:13:25,490 --> 03:13:26,490
Yeah, stay there!

4399
03:13:27,030 --> 03:13:28,470
Wait, I can literally...

4400
03:13:28,470 --> 03:13:29,330
Oh, I can literally...

4401
03:13:29,330 --> 03:13:29,470
Oh, ow.

4402
03:13:30,230 --> 03:13:30,930
It's fine.

4403
03:13:31,190 --> 03:13:32,750
What a formidable beast!

4404
03:13:33,210 --> 03:13:34,570
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

4405
03:13:36,230 --> 03:13:37,030
Everything's fine.

4406
03:13:37,530 --> 03:13:38,730
Oh, it's okay.

4407
03:13:39,150 --> 03:13:40,590
It's just a little damage.

4408
03:13:40,810 --> 03:13:42,990
It's okay if like anything bad happens.

4409
03:13:43,250 --> 03:13:44,950
We can literally just...

4410
03:13:45,750 --> 03:13:47,130
Just swap to a tank.

4411
03:13:48,450 --> 03:13:49,430
Wait, where did he go?

4412
03:13:49,670 --> 03:13:50,770
Bullets seem to be hurting it.

4413
03:13:51,650 --> 03:13:52,730
Shit, no, really?

4414
03:13:55,530 --> 03:13:56,550
Oh my god.

4415
03:13:56,610 --> 03:13:59,310
If it's not hurting it, we would be in so much shit.

4416
03:13:59,330 --> 03:13:59,590
We would be in so much trouble.

4417
03:14:01,410 --> 03:14:02,670
That's all I'm saying.

4418
03:14:03,310 --> 03:14:05,370
It better be hurting it, Rao.

4419
03:14:05,530 --> 03:14:07,170
It better be hurting it, Rao.

4420
03:14:07,850 --> 03:14:09,290
I hope so.

4421
03:14:10,110 --> 03:14:11,250
I hope so.

4422
03:14:11,730 --> 03:14:14,010
It would be awkward if it's not.

4423
03:14:14,490 --> 03:14:14,670
It would be awkward if it's not.

4424
03:14:14,670 --> 03:14:14,910
It would be awkward if it's not.

4425
03:14:18,640 --> 03:14:19,140
Alright.

4426
03:14:21,020 --> 03:14:21,740
Oh, shit.

4427
03:14:23,620 --> 03:14:24,600
Oh my god.

4428
03:14:24,980 --> 03:14:26,960
Bro, okay, I'm fucking bringing out the tank.

4429
03:14:27,100 --> 03:14:27,620
There's no way.

4430
03:14:28,300 --> 03:14:29,300
There's no way.

4431
03:14:29,660 --> 03:14:30,480
Oh, shit.

4432
03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:31,580
Okay, I'm bringing out the tank.

4433
03:14:31,640 --> 03:14:33,340
I feel like the tank is stronger, right?

4434
03:14:33,960 --> 03:14:34,400
Ow.

4435
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:39,040
Ow, it's fine.

4436
03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:40,920
Oh my god, it barely does any damage.

4437
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:42,160
I can literally take this.

4438
03:14:43,120 --> 03:14:44,220
Guys, I can literally...

4439
03:14:44,220 --> 03:14:45,260
Get it?

4440
03:14:47,060 --> 03:14:48,640
I can literally just stand here.

4441
03:14:48,940 --> 03:14:51,120
This fucking squid does nothing.

4442
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:52,680
Look at that.

4443
03:14:53,220 --> 03:14:55,060
It's just a fucking slap.

4444
03:14:55,660 --> 03:14:56,500
What are you gonna do?

4445
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:57,060
Oh, okay.

4446
03:14:57,140 --> 03:14:57,520
Never mind.

4447
03:14:57,620 --> 03:14:58,900
That took a lot of damage, actually.

4448
03:14:59,080 --> 03:14:59,780
Never mind.

4449
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:03,500
Never mind.

4450
03:15:03,660 --> 03:15:04,200
It's okay.

4451
03:15:05,060 --> 03:15:05,720
It's okay.

4452
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:06,460
It'll heal himself.

4453
03:15:06,700 --> 03:15:07,880
I have the cutscene here.

4454
03:15:09,260 --> 03:15:10,860
The cutscene will heal me.

4455
03:15:12,620 --> 03:15:13,100
Ow.

4456
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:16,620
Don't worry.

4457
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:17,940
The cutscene will heal me.

4458
03:15:19,400 --> 03:15:20,120
Look, see?

4459
03:15:20,220 --> 03:15:21,080
Half HP.

4460
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:22,800
Nothing to worry about.

4461
03:15:24,200 --> 03:15:25,060
Where did he go?

4462
03:15:27,620 --> 03:15:28,140
Oh, shit.

4463
03:15:29,700 --> 03:15:31,060
What am I supposed to do?

4464
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:32,760
Yeah, don't worry.

4465
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:33,760
I'm not worried.

4466
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:35,060
Fuck, I'm just gonna stand here.

4467
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:41,900
I only have to move when it comes to the big guy.

4468
03:15:42,180 --> 03:15:43,620
The slaps down, yeah.

4469
03:15:44,300 --> 03:15:44,780
Oh.

4470
03:15:45,020 --> 03:15:47,600
I mean, I can literally just stand here for this one.

4471
03:15:48,720 --> 03:15:50,260
I feel like I don't have to...

4472
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:52,780
I actually have to worry about these guys.

4473
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:57,600
I feel like I don't have to...

4474
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:58,020
I'm gonna go to the water.

4475
03:15:58,400 --> 03:16:01,980
I forgot my tank cannot swim, guys.

4476
03:16:02,720 --> 03:16:05,480
The most crucial, important information.

4477
03:16:05,660 --> 03:16:06,300
I can't swim.

4478
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:08,460
Okay.

4479
03:16:08,840 --> 03:16:10,140
We're not swimming.

4480
03:16:11,900 --> 03:16:12,620
Really?

4481
03:16:13,900 --> 03:16:14,620
Where?

4482
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:17,520
Ow.

4483
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:21,180
Please, squid!

4484
03:16:21,380 --> 03:16:21,980
Come out!

4485
03:16:22,460 --> 03:16:23,120
More!

4486
03:16:27,280 --> 03:16:28,680
Oh my god.

4487
03:16:30,020 --> 03:16:30,400
Fuck it.

4488
03:16:30,980 --> 03:16:31,920
It's just easier.

4489
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:35,420
It's just easier at this point to get this over with.

4490
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:39,060
Get over here.

4491
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:40,660
Get over here.

4492
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:43,260
Where are you?

4493
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:47,860
Oh, he's so...

4494
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:48,100
Wait!

4495
03:16:48,380 --> 03:16:50,760
My other car was doing actually more damage.

4496
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:51,180
Oops.

4497
03:16:52,220 --> 03:16:52,700
Oops.

4498
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:54,920
Was not paying attention.

4499
03:16:57,160 --> 03:16:57,640
Wait.

4500
03:16:57,840 --> 03:16:59,200
He only shoots one and leave.

4501
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:00,560
Where did he go?

4502
03:17:01,460 --> 03:17:01,780
Woo!

4503
03:17:03,560 --> 03:17:04,040
Okay.

4504
03:17:04,540 --> 03:17:05,160
Come on!

4505
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:07,760
That's fucking right.

4506
03:17:07,820 --> 03:17:08,600
You can't catch me.

4507
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:09,040
I'm hovering.

4508
03:17:12,760 --> 03:17:14,380
Yeah, but the tank was tankier.

4509
03:17:14,440 --> 03:17:14,900
Exactly.

4510
03:17:16,100 --> 03:17:16,860
Oh god.

4511
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:17,620
God damn it.

4512
03:17:17,660 --> 03:17:19,120
He hits me and then he leaves.

4513
03:17:20,560 --> 03:17:21,640
He hit and runs.

4514
03:17:21,900 --> 03:17:22,640
That's fucked up.

4515
03:17:22,860 --> 03:17:23,320
What?

4516
03:17:25,400 --> 03:17:26,160
Where did he go?

4517
03:17:27,640 --> 03:17:28,120
Oh!

4518
03:17:29,200 --> 03:17:29,680
Okay.

4519
03:17:29,780 --> 03:17:30,040
Nice.

4520
03:17:30,200 --> 03:17:30,860
Got him.

4521
03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:32,920
He's so close to dying.

4522
03:17:32,960 --> 03:17:34,040
He's literally one hit.

4523
03:17:34,860 --> 03:17:35,720
He's two hits.

4524
03:17:35,780 --> 03:17:36,060
Sorry.

4525
03:17:36,120 --> 03:17:36,640
I can't count.

4526
03:17:37,640 --> 03:17:38,120
No!

4527
03:17:44,140 --> 03:17:44,620
Okay.

4528
03:17:44,680 --> 03:17:44,920
Nice.

4529
03:17:44,980 --> 03:17:45,260
No!

4530
03:17:46,580 --> 03:17:47,460
Oh my god.

4531
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:48,160
Where is he coming at?

4532
03:17:48,220 --> 03:17:48,460
Okay.

4533
03:17:48,480 --> 03:17:48,780
Nice.

4534
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:51,440
Yes!

4535
03:17:51,860 --> 03:17:52,620
We did it.

4536
03:17:54,040 --> 03:17:54,520
Coward!

4537
03:17:55,360 --> 03:17:57,680
Why can't you take the hits like I did?

4538
03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:06,080
God damn coward.

4539
03:18:29,130 --> 03:18:30,110
Oh shit.

4540
03:18:30,110 --> 03:18:30,890
Now he's gonna drown.

4541
03:18:55,650 --> 03:18:56,530
Oh my god.

4542
03:18:56,590 --> 03:18:56,950
We're here.

4543
03:18:57,610 --> 03:18:59,550
Where the heck am I?

4544
03:18:59,750 --> 03:19:00,850
Oh my god.

4545
03:19:01,790 --> 03:19:03,430
I'm eating but we're here.

4546
03:19:04,770 --> 03:19:06,810
I don't recognize this smell.

4547
03:19:10,580 --> 03:19:12,040
We're finally here.

4548
03:19:12,540 --> 03:19:13,360
This air is way too pure for me.

4549
03:19:13,360 --> 03:19:15,720
I told you it's not Glitch Bay.

4550
03:19:16,060 --> 03:19:16,440
I'm sick.

4551
03:19:16,760 --> 03:19:17,360
I'm sick.

4552
03:19:17,360 --> 03:19:17,400
I'm sick.

4553
03:19:17,400 --> 03:19:17,860
I'm sick.

4554
03:19:19,820 --> 03:19:21,820
Where's Thief and the old man?

4555
03:19:22,480 --> 03:19:27,060
I told you Forest Land was real guys.

4556
03:19:27,620 --> 03:19:29,740
I told you Forest Land was real guys.

4557
03:19:29,740 --> 03:19:31,240
After 200 years.

4558
03:19:31,580 --> 03:19:31,780
After 200 years.

4559
03:19:31,780 --> 03:19:34,240
We finally made it.

4560
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:36,560
It's real.

4561
03:19:37,960 --> 03:19:39,200
There's monkeys.

4562
03:19:40,880 --> 03:19:41,600
There's monkeys.

4563
03:19:42,480 --> 03:19:44,620
Marshal thank you for the super chat.

4564
03:19:44,740 --> 03:19:45,160
Thank you.

4565
03:19:45,180 --> 03:19:45,780
Thank you.

4566
03:19:45,900 --> 03:19:47,860
I told you it was real.

4567
03:19:47,880 --> 03:19:48,920
It wasn't Glitch Bay.

4568
03:19:50,760 --> 03:19:52,200
It existed.

4569
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:55,080
There's actual trees.

4570
03:19:55,960 --> 03:19:56,680
There's actual trees.

4571
03:19:58,780 --> 03:19:59,500
There's actual trees.

4572
03:19:59,500 --> 03:20:00,080
Oh my god.

4573
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:00,780
And there's loot.

4574
03:20:01,020 --> 03:20:02,400
I'm gonna yoink all that loot.

4575
03:20:04,040 --> 03:20:04,760
Nice.

4576
03:20:04,760 --> 03:20:05,500
Mine now.

4577
03:20:06,300 --> 03:20:07,400
It's real.

4578
03:20:09,260 --> 03:20:11,680
You guys thought I was crazy.

4579
03:20:11,780 --> 03:20:12,200
You guys thought I was crazy.

4580
03:20:12,200 --> 03:20:14,020
But I knew trees existed.

4581
03:20:16,680 --> 03:20:17,820
But I knew trees existed.

4582
03:20:17,880 --> 03:20:20,140
I can't believe it.

4583
03:20:20,900 --> 03:20:22,940
No more sand.

4584
03:20:23,260 --> 03:20:23,980
No more sand.

4585
03:20:25,560 --> 03:20:27,260
Now let's ruin the environment.

4586
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:29,520
With a tank.

4587
03:20:33,560 --> 03:20:36,860
Finally what I wanted to do all this time.

4588
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:40,320
Green.

4589
03:20:40,900 --> 03:20:42,980
Thank you for the super chat.

4590
03:20:43,260 --> 03:20:44,400
Nova thank you.

4591
03:20:44,560 --> 03:20:44,980
Thank you.

4592
03:20:44,980 --> 03:20:47,780
Time to turn this into a desert.

4593
03:20:55,120 --> 03:20:56,540
Come on out.

4594
03:20:56,880 --> 03:20:59,480
It's useless to hide from a fiend.

4595
03:21:01,220 --> 03:21:02,420
A fiend?

4596
03:21:02,600 --> 03:21:04,020
A real demon?

4597
03:21:04,940 --> 03:21:06,020
Holy shit.

4598
03:21:06,120 --> 03:21:07,500
What's wrong with your face?

4599
03:21:08,460 --> 03:21:09,500
Is this what?

4600
03:21:09,660 --> 03:21:12,000
Just look at all of you crawling out of the woodwork.

4601
03:21:12,340 --> 03:21:13,160
Oh my god.

4602
03:21:13,320 --> 03:21:15,320
These people have belts.

4603
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:21,080
You really are a demon.

4604
03:21:21,520 --> 03:21:22,120
I'm not a demon.

4605
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:25,580
What are demons doing in forest land?

4606
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:28,020
Nigel Thornberry.

4607
03:21:28,420 --> 03:21:28,820
Huh?

4608
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:31,100
We're in forest land?

4609
03:21:31,420 --> 03:21:32,980
No shit Beelzebub.

4610
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:34,660
What do you think this is?

4611
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:37,220
Wow this is awesome.

4612
03:21:37,440 --> 03:21:39,140
I've never seen a demon before.

4613
03:21:39,480 --> 03:21:40,900
Why is he like a surfer bro?

4614
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:43,280
He does not look like a surfer.

4615
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:44,840
Okay not gonna lie.

4616
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:47,500
The male number three.

4617
03:21:47,540 --> 03:21:49,880
Seems to have the wrong voice acting.

4618
03:21:51,240 --> 03:21:52,120
You think I'm a surfer?

4619
03:21:52,140 --> 03:21:53,000
You think this is a safari?

4620
03:21:53,200 --> 03:21:53,920
Surround them.

4621
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:59,900
We can't just stand by and let these filthy demons invade our home.

4622
03:22:00,120 --> 03:22:00,200
Woooah.

4623
03:22:02,100 --> 03:22:02,580
Okay.

4624
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:03,980
Not this again.

4625
03:22:04,500 --> 03:22:07,420
Don't tell me you guys are part of the forest land army too.

4626
03:22:08,860 --> 03:22:09,540
Doesn't matter.

4627
03:22:09,860 --> 03:22:12,140
If it's a fight you want, I'll give you one.

4628
03:22:12,140 --> 03:22:13,680
Wow male number one.

4629
03:22:14,720 --> 03:22:15,200
Wow.

4630
03:22:16,620 --> 03:22:17,100
Wow.

4631
03:22:17,800 --> 03:22:18,280
Wait.

4632
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:20,420
Okay.

4633
03:22:22,140 --> 03:22:22,280
I'm right.

4634
03:22:22,500 --> 03:22:24,940
You should not have pissed me off.

4635
03:22:27,900 --> 03:22:29,500
Big mistake.

4636
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:33,120
Big mistake.

4637
03:22:33,240 --> 03:22:33,700
Big mistake.

4638
03:22:34,260 --> 03:22:36,600
He touched me.

4639
03:22:36,900 --> 03:22:38,400
It's all over.

4640
03:22:38,740 --> 03:22:40,500
I told you.

4641
03:22:41,720 --> 03:22:44,300
No demon cooties.

4642
03:22:44,460 --> 03:22:45,500
No demon cooties.

4643
03:22:45,500 --> 03:22:47,680
We have to protect our country.

4644
03:22:48,360 --> 03:22:52,120
We have to protect our country.

4645
03:22:53,780 --> 03:22:55,100
Say that again.

4646
03:22:55,220 --> 03:22:55,860
Say that again you little...

4647
03:22:56,820 --> 03:22:57,340
Woah.

4648
03:22:57,520 --> 03:22:58,780
PG 13.

4649
03:23:00,160 --> 03:23:00,680
Raul.

4650
03:23:02,600 --> 03:23:03,800
Look the monkeys.

4651
03:23:04,140 --> 03:23:06,220
The monkeys like, what's going on over here guys?

4652
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:08,300
Woah.

4653
03:23:08,500 --> 03:23:10,040
Did you see that?

4654
03:23:10,100 --> 03:23:11,460
Look like you ran a little wild.

4655
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:16,060
That'll teach him to mess with the fiend prince.

4656
03:23:17,440 --> 03:23:18,300
I say.

4657
03:23:18,400 --> 03:23:20,040
They could do with more punishment.

4658
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:29,500
Elderly person's voice.

4659
03:23:30,380 --> 03:23:30,940
Yeah, who are you?

4660
03:23:33,580 --> 03:23:34,240
What the fuck?

4661
03:23:36,600 --> 03:23:38,060
That's a lot of gel.

4662
03:23:38,840 --> 03:23:39,880
Is that the king?

4663
03:23:51,360 --> 03:23:52,600
It's like a little umbrella.

4664
03:23:53,560 --> 03:23:57,140
You can make like... Has anyone ever made like a hair umbrella?

4665
03:24:22,030 --> 03:24:24,070
This has to be the king, right?

4666
03:24:27,750 --> 03:24:29,770
Are these the guys that hate demons?

4667
03:24:35,170 --> 03:24:36,470
Alright, let's go.

4668
03:24:36,730 --> 03:24:39,410
Continue on with Lango.

4669
03:24:43,990 --> 03:24:46,470
Oh my god, there's purple raptors.

4670
03:24:46,570 --> 03:24:49,270
I told you guys the raptors were invasive species.

4671
03:24:49,630 --> 03:24:51,330
They came from forest land.

4672
03:24:53,330 --> 03:24:55,330
I was doing my job.

4673
03:24:55,470 --> 03:24:56,110
I was doing my job.

4674
03:25:00,790 --> 03:25:02,190
I knew it.

4675
03:25:02,230 --> 03:25:04,350
I fucking knew they were invasive.

4676
03:25:04,930 --> 03:25:06,770
They came from the forest.

4677
03:25:10,830 --> 03:25:13,670
This is for... She was right.

4678
03:25:14,570 --> 03:25:16,930
They are like the iguanas.

4679
03:25:19,370 --> 03:25:20,870
No, there's no way.

4680
03:25:21,110 --> 03:25:25,850
As a sand lander, there's no way these... the raptors came from us.

4681
03:25:25,850 --> 03:25:28,570
It has to be from the forest.

4682
03:25:36,950 --> 03:25:39,610
Thanks to you, I bought trains and how do we move forward?

4683
03:25:40,070 --> 03:25:42,650
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

4684
03:25:42,730 --> 03:25:43,130
Thank you.

4685
03:25:43,150 --> 03:25:43,810
Thank you.

4686
03:25:43,890 --> 03:25:46,010
Remember to have your lights on.

4687
03:25:47,030 --> 03:25:48,610
Oh wait, there's a chest here.

4688
03:25:49,270 --> 03:25:49,770
Yoink.

4689
03:25:49,770 --> 03:25:50,810
My chest now.

4690
03:25:51,770 --> 03:25:53,230
Oh wait, I didn't pick it up.

4691
03:25:55,110 --> 03:25:56,770
I fucking knew it.

4692
03:25:56,830 --> 03:26:00,770
You guys thought I was crazy when I told you about the invasive species.

4693
03:26:03,590 --> 03:26:05,730
You guys were like, don't you know?

4694
03:26:06,070 --> 03:26:08,450
Think about the animal rights.

4695
03:26:08,970 --> 03:26:10,130
But I knew it.

4696
03:26:10,170 --> 03:26:11,330
I knew they were invasive.

4697
03:26:13,570 --> 03:26:15,090
The Floridians were right.

4698
03:26:18,750 --> 03:26:20,750
Wait, I'm going... Oh no, I'm going the right way.

4699
03:26:20,830 --> 03:26:21,030
Okay.

4700
03:26:21,150 --> 03:26:22,850
I should use the bike now.

4701
03:26:23,230 --> 03:26:25,310
To try to determine the princess's location.

4702
03:26:26,510 --> 03:26:32,050
Once they discover where she was taken, we will devote all our forces to the task of freeing her.

4703
03:26:33,470 --> 03:26:34,030
See?

4704
03:26:34,250 --> 03:26:36,110
The peddler has a blue raptor.

4705
03:26:37,130 --> 03:26:38,450
I fucking knew it.

4706
03:26:41,290 --> 03:26:41,850
See?

4707
03:26:42,050 --> 03:26:43,530
They even have their own cats.

4708
03:26:43,950 --> 03:26:46,650
I knew the cats were invasive species too.

4709
03:26:47,850 --> 03:26:50,550
How did the cats survive in the sand?

4710
03:26:50,950 --> 03:26:52,070
I knew it.

4711
03:26:52,070 --> 03:26:53,930
There's no cats in the sand.

4712
03:26:53,970 --> 03:26:55,090
There's no cats in sand.

4713
03:26:56,950 --> 03:26:58,330
I knew it.

4714
03:26:58,650 --> 03:26:59,770
All along.

4715
03:27:00,770 --> 03:27:02,730
I was right all along.

4716
03:27:02,830 --> 03:27:05,350
They all came from forest land.

4717
03:27:09,110 --> 03:27:11,290
Every single one of them.

4718
03:27:13,370 --> 03:27:15,650
We'll kill them just in advance.

4719
03:27:17,010 --> 03:27:18,030
I knew it.

4720
03:27:18,070 --> 03:27:19,090
Sand lands aren't real.

4721
03:27:20,270 --> 03:27:21,790
Now that's why I knew it.

4722
03:27:21,830 --> 03:27:22,950
Sand cats weren't real.

4723
03:27:24,890 --> 03:27:26,690
There's always an origin.

4724
03:27:28,610 --> 03:27:29,230
No.

4725
03:27:29,430 --> 03:27:30,670
They don't exist.

4726
03:27:30,810 --> 03:27:31,990
That's just propaganda.

4727
03:27:33,410 --> 03:27:35,690
Spread by the forest landers.

4728
03:27:37,810 --> 03:27:40,370
No, there's no... I don't know what you guys are talking about.

4729
03:27:40,490 --> 03:27:41,590
Desert cats never existed.

4730
03:27:42,210 --> 03:27:46,570
They're just propaganda spread by... by the forest landers.

4731
03:27:46,570 --> 03:27:50,430
They train on the assumption that war could break out at any moment.

4732
03:27:51,350 --> 03:27:55,830
That mindset alone might explain the difference in strength between them and the royal army.

4733
03:27:57,470 --> 03:27:59,350
Alright, we gotta go... where is it?

4734
03:27:59,410 --> 03:27:59,990
Oh, it's this way.

4735
03:28:02,550 --> 03:28:04,850
You seem to be very well informed.

4736
03:28:07,050 --> 03:28:12,850
I'm someone who failed to protect his kind and just king in his time of need.

4737
03:28:12,910 --> 03:28:13,410
What the fuck?

4738
03:28:13,450 --> 03:28:14,230
Who are you?

4739
03:28:14,230 --> 03:28:18,910
The most I managed to do for him was flee with his young, innocent daughter.

4740
03:28:19,930 --> 03:28:21,850
Just a feeble old man, really.

4741
03:28:23,090 --> 03:28:24,390
Not so feeble.

4742
03:28:24,490 --> 03:28:27,050
I refuse to believe you're a feeble old man.

4743
03:28:27,450 --> 03:28:28,530
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

4744
03:28:28,590 --> 03:28:29,250
Thank you, thank you.

4745
03:28:29,290 --> 03:28:31,230
Whoa, sand cats are a real thing.

4746
03:28:31,410 --> 03:28:34,250
And they are the most adorable wild cats out there.

4747
03:28:34,410 --> 03:28:35,770
Thank you for the super chat.

4748
03:28:36,150 --> 03:28:39,110
You pay with pay with your forest land money.

4749
03:28:41,810 --> 03:28:42,630
Please don't.

4750
03:28:43,670 --> 03:28:45,890
Brought to you by the king of forest land.

4751
03:28:48,990 --> 03:28:50,730
He has to be the king.

4752
03:28:58,420 --> 03:28:59,800
See, I told you.

4753
03:28:59,880 --> 03:29:00,840
It's starting.

4754
03:29:01,020 --> 03:29:03,700
The forest land propaganda is already starting.

4755
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:14,020
How do you seize more territory for forest land?

4756
03:29:14,460 --> 03:29:16,120
And all the forest is yours.

4757
03:29:18,280 --> 03:29:21,380
That's something the four of us would like to know more about too.

4758
03:29:22,740 --> 03:29:24,300
The forest agenda.

4759
03:29:25,180 --> 03:29:26,220
Swimmer, what are you doing here?

4760
03:29:28,660 --> 03:29:31,520
What was that about how you'd never join forces with us?

4761
03:29:32,340 --> 03:29:34,460
They're trying to plant trees that are sad.

4762
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:36,180
We can't let them.

4763
03:29:36,960 --> 03:29:41,340
We can't let their disgusting trees touch our precious sand.

4764
03:29:41,760 --> 03:29:44,340
Or that line about how we never meet again.

4765
03:29:44,500 --> 03:29:44,880
Hmm?

4766
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:47,920
You better not.

4767
03:29:47,920 --> 03:29:49,780
You heard about Big Pharma.

4768
03:29:49,840 --> 03:29:51,280
This is big tree time.

4769
03:29:52,200 --> 03:29:55,880
Are you gonna turn down a request from an old comrade?

4770
03:29:57,880 --> 03:29:58,440
Huh?

4771
03:29:58,440 --> 03:30:01,040
So this old man was in your gang of thieves?

4772
03:30:02,340 --> 03:30:02,900
No!

4773
03:30:03,140 --> 03:30:04,940
I was in the rebel army.

4774
03:30:05,280 --> 03:30:06,480
You were in the rebel army?

4775
03:30:06,660 --> 03:30:09,160
You're not even a sand... I knew it.

4776
03:30:09,220 --> 03:30:13,140
No sand lander would try to swim in sand land.

4777
03:30:13,900 --> 03:30:14,960
I'm not a sand lander.

4778
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:16,100
I'm fucking a sand lander.

4779
03:30:16,940 --> 03:30:19,080
I fucking knew it.

4780
03:30:20,080 --> 03:30:20,920
That's correct.

4781
03:30:21,020 --> 03:30:23,320
What kind of sand lander would try to swim?

4782
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:27,500
I know how formidable an enemy you make.

4783
03:30:27,720 --> 03:30:29,720
I'm glad to have you as an ally instead.

4784
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:36,020
The reason he was so strong is because he had our swimmers on his side.

4785
03:30:36,820 --> 03:30:38,900
Papa, your face is all red.

4786
03:30:39,640 --> 03:30:42,200
Is anybody a real sand lander?

4787
03:30:42,580 --> 03:30:43,700
Yeah, probably.

4788
03:30:45,260 --> 03:30:48,380
Who's even from sand land at this rate?

4789
03:30:49,800 --> 03:30:55,740
His goal is to gather up the last five extant aquanium capsules in the world.

4790
03:30:57,260 --> 03:31:01,540
And use them to restart Garum, the flying fortress.

4791
03:31:01,940 --> 03:31:03,280
The flying fortress?

4792
03:31:03,700 --> 03:31:05,660
Where the fuck did that come from?

4793
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:07,040
The flying fortress.

4794
03:31:07,040 --> 03:31:08,520
Yeah, same route.

4795
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:09,180
Same.

4796
03:31:10,540 --> 03:31:12,980
The former peachy mothership.

4797
03:31:12,980 --> 03:31:15,940
Which landed in flatland so many years ago.

4798
03:31:16,060 --> 03:31:17,160
There's a flatland?

4799
03:31:18,640 --> 03:31:19,600
Bro, what...

4800
03:31:20,500 --> 03:31:22,880
What does flatland have?

4801
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:30,660
After being modified for battle, it's said to have been the world's most powerful warship.

4802
03:31:31,640 --> 03:31:32,920
Another land?

4803
03:31:33,260 --> 03:31:35,620
What does flatland even have?

4804
03:31:35,920 --> 03:31:38,020
It's unclear how much of this is true.

4805
03:31:40,380 --> 03:31:42,960
But rumor has it that it took only three years to build it.

4806
03:31:42,960 --> 03:31:51,980
Three days for its terrible weapons to send flatland, the world's wealthiest, most advanced nation, to the bottom of the ocean.

4807
03:31:51,980 --> 03:31:53,820
Oh my god, flatland's Atlantis!

4808
03:31:55,800 --> 03:31:57,400
Now it's ocean land!

4809
03:31:58,140 --> 03:31:59,660
It's badder than even Zeyu's fortress?

4810
03:32:02,320 --> 03:32:08,220
Without a doubt, if its capabilities require five times the aquanium to power...

4811
03:32:09,240 --> 03:32:12,360
What will they do if they ever manage to get it working?

4812
03:32:12,360 --> 03:32:15,920
The forest land made sure of it.

4813
03:32:16,980 --> 03:32:18,900
Winners write the history books.

4814
03:32:19,340 --> 03:32:21,220
Flatland never existed.

4815
03:32:21,820 --> 03:32:23,520
Well, the world will have the power to bring the world to its knees.

4816
03:32:25,320 --> 03:32:26,860
To hell with that!

4817
03:32:26,880 --> 03:32:27,580
To hell with that!

4818
03:32:28,940 --> 03:32:30,220
I'm not bending to another!

4819
03:32:32,940 --> 03:32:36,360
I share that sentiment, which is why we...

4820
03:32:37,920 --> 03:32:38,580
Lungo!

4821
03:32:40,140 --> 03:32:41,580
What the fuck is Udo?

4822
03:32:43,220 --> 03:32:44,720
It's male number one!

4823
03:32:45,300 --> 03:32:45,720
Excuse me.

4824
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:46,560
Oh no, he's...

4825
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:48,580
It seems I have urgent business to attend to.

4826
03:32:48,860 --> 03:32:49,380
Yeah.

4827
03:32:50,420 --> 03:32:53,160
I will probably be occupied for some time.

4828
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:54,720
Male number one has a name now!

4829
03:32:55,300 --> 03:32:56,120
He won't rest up in the meantime.

4830
03:32:57,340 --> 03:32:58,840
We'll take you up on that.

4831
03:32:59,940 --> 03:33:02,360
We're awful tired from swimming here.

4832
03:33:04,100 --> 03:33:05,760
Let's make the rounds of the camp.

4833
03:33:06,020 --> 03:33:09,480
We should take the chance to gather whatever intelligence we can.

4834
03:33:10,780 --> 03:33:11,320
All right.

4835
03:33:13,180 --> 03:33:14,820
I can't believe it.

4836
03:33:15,080 --> 03:33:17,400
We just found out about Flatland.

4837
03:33:17,600 --> 03:33:20,340
Only for Flatland to never exist...

4838
03:33:20,340 --> 03:33:22,080
To not exist anymore.

4839
03:33:22,220 --> 03:33:23,600
It became Oceanland.

4840
03:33:24,340 --> 03:33:26,160
The Atlantis of Flatland.

4841
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:29,720
We don't need that.

4842
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:31,060
Oh, he can upgrade my stuff.

4843
03:33:32,600 --> 03:33:33,120
Hey!

4844
03:33:34,500 --> 03:33:35,960
Yeah, I want to upgrade.

4845
03:33:36,300 --> 03:33:38,260
Okay, we can actually upgrade our parts now.

4846
03:33:38,360 --> 03:33:41,020
I feel like that's something we haven't really done.

4847
03:33:41,080 --> 03:33:41,300
Wait, I have to upgrade my equipment.

4848
03:33:41,300 --> 03:33:45,560
Actually, let's make sure our vehicle has all the parts we need.

4849
03:33:47,440 --> 03:33:50,580
No, I like the damage.

4850
03:33:50,720 --> 03:33:52,000
I like the damage it does.

4851
03:33:52,140 --> 03:33:52,620
So...

4852
03:33:53,420 --> 03:33:54,140
Let's see.

4853
03:33:54,220 --> 03:33:54,580
Oh, wait.

4854
03:33:54,620 --> 03:33:55,000
That's new.

4855
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:56,000
Outrigger?

4856
03:33:57,420 --> 03:33:59,740
Enables rapid fire at the cost of mobility.

4857
03:34:00,220 --> 03:34:01,180
No, we need defense.

4858
03:34:01,260 --> 03:34:02,960
We really need defense.

4859
03:34:05,400 --> 03:34:06,100
All right.

4860
03:34:06,120 --> 03:34:06,540
Let's see.

4861
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:07,800
Let's upgrade our part.

4862
03:34:08,020 --> 03:34:11,140
Because I feel like we have not done that at all.

4863
03:34:11,140 --> 03:34:12,900
Okay, because we still can't.

4864
03:34:12,900 --> 03:34:13,280
Never mind.

4865
03:34:13,380 --> 03:34:14,180
Let's not do that.

4866
03:34:14,440 --> 03:34:15,900
I guess we just don't.

4867
03:34:16,320 --> 03:34:18,200
Give Forestland a chance.

4868
03:34:18,420 --> 03:34:19,980
They did nothing wrong.

4869
03:34:20,380 --> 03:34:20,900
All right.

4870
03:34:20,920 --> 03:34:22,400
Thank you for the super chat.

4871
03:34:22,520 --> 03:34:22,940
Thank you.

4872
03:34:22,940 --> 03:34:23,540
Thank you.

4873
03:34:24,280 --> 03:34:26,200
Spoken like a true propagandist.

4874
03:34:32,120 --> 03:34:33,560
Golden, thank you for the super chat.

4875
03:34:33,620 --> 03:34:33,940
Thank you.

4876
03:34:33,960 --> 03:34:34,560
Thank you.

4877
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:37,420
Flatland is known for its justice and cutting boards.

4878
03:34:37,540 --> 03:34:38,580
Thank you for the super chat.

4879
03:34:38,660 --> 03:34:38,920
Thank you.

4880
03:34:38,960 --> 03:34:39,360
Thank you.

4881
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:40,700
You set the forest ladder!

4882
03:34:46,060 --> 03:34:49,840
Are there even real forest ladders in this world?

4883
03:34:52,580 --> 03:34:53,220
Okay.

4884
03:34:56,420 --> 03:34:57,360
Let's go.

4885
03:34:57,740 --> 03:34:59,340
Excuse me.

4886
03:34:59,340 --> 03:34:59,620
Excuse me, my little one.

4887
03:34:59,620 --> 03:34:59,620
go.

4888
03:34:59,620 --> 03:35:00,120
Where do we go?

4889
03:35:00,260 --> 03:35:01,560
There's like two different ways.

4890
03:35:02,920 --> 03:35:03,560
Oh!

4891
03:35:03,680 --> 03:35:04,100
That was great.

4892
03:35:04,840 --> 03:35:05,960
See you then!

4893
03:35:05,960 --> 03:35:06,360
Oh, thank you, I failed again.

4894
03:35:06,720 --> 03:35:07,360
Okay.

4895
03:35:07,900 --> 03:35:10,040
See you Male number two has a name!

4896
03:35:11,790 --> 03:35:13,240
Forest Ladder spotted.

4897
03:35:22,090 --> 03:35:23,700
The Onceler was right.

4898
03:35:42,720 --> 03:35:44,600
Oh, he's a newbie.

4899
03:35:50,840 --> 03:35:52,300
There's another war?

4900
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:08,520
Wait, there was another war?

4901
03:36:08,540 --> 03:36:10,900
How many wars were there?

4902
03:36:12,200 --> 03:36:13,720
I had the Peachy War.

4903
03:36:14,060 --> 03:36:16,120
And then there's like a different one?

4904
03:36:17,440 --> 03:36:18,880
Oh, it's the same war.

4905
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:19,820
It just happened everywhere.

4906
03:36:20,360 --> 03:36:21,820
Mack, thank you for the super chat.

4907
03:36:21,900 --> 03:36:22,760
Thank you, thank you.

4908
03:36:22,800 --> 03:36:26,000
Flatland enjoyed a time of great peace.

4909
03:36:26,180 --> 03:36:28,680
Until the Forest Nation attacked.

4910
03:36:32,780 --> 03:36:34,080
Oh, what's this?

4911
03:36:34,760 --> 03:36:35,920
Power chip, nice.

4912
03:36:39,240 --> 03:36:41,820
Okay, Kishim- Oh my god, male number three!

4913
03:36:42,440 --> 03:36:45,900
You're not generic characters who actually all have names.

4914
03:36:46,380 --> 03:36:47,160
Not really.

4915
03:36:47,360 --> 03:36:49,900
It's pretty hard to tell all you humans apart.

4916
03:36:50,980 --> 03:36:52,300
Hmm, hmm.

4917
03:36:52,540 --> 03:36:55,640
So demons have difficulty distinguishing humans.

4918
03:36:55,820 --> 03:36:58,420
How do you have difficulty distinguishing this guy?

4919
03:36:59,040 --> 03:37:00,180
What are you doing?

4920
03:37:00,360 --> 03:37:01,560
Taking notes?

4921
03:37:05,640 --> 03:37:08,660
Well, um, you know, knowledge is power.

4922
03:37:08,940 --> 03:37:10,420
Especially for women.

4923
03:37:11,420 --> 03:37:11,980
Whoa!

4924
03:37:12,400 --> 03:37:14,880
Bro, be kind to yourself, man.

4925
03:37:16,560 --> 03:37:17,940
I'm a royalist.

4926
03:37:17,980 --> 03:37:20,800
I want King Jam back in charge of this country.

4927
03:37:21,580 --> 03:37:23,500
Everyone here would say the same.

4928
03:37:23,940 --> 03:37:27,880
And that's reason enough to lay down your life for him?

4929
03:37:28,100 --> 03:37:30,980
I mean, you lay down your life for your prince, right?

4930
03:37:31,380 --> 03:37:32,660
Hmm, fascinating.

4931
03:37:33,060 --> 03:37:36,060
So demons struggle with the idea of self-sacrifice.

4932
03:37:36,620 --> 03:37:37,180
There.

4933
03:37:38,220 --> 03:37:38,780
Why?

4934
03:37:38,980 --> 03:37:40,320
That's not true at all.

4935
03:37:40,380 --> 03:37:40,460
I'm not a demon.

4936
03:37:40,480 --> 03:37:43,300
I'd gladly give my life for King Lucifer.

4937
03:37:43,560 --> 03:37:43,660
Yeah.

4938
03:37:43,660 --> 03:37:44,680
I thought he'd give his life for you.

4939
03:37:45,500 --> 03:37:47,000
Look, you're a prince, not a king.

4940
03:37:47,480 --> 03:37:48,940
A king can have more children.

4941
03:37:49,480 --> 03:37:50,880
But we can't have another king.

4942
03:37:52,640 --> 03:37:55,860
I suppose I'd at least lay down my whiskers for you.

4943
03:37:56,380 --> 03:37:56,780
I suppose I'd at least lay down my whiskers for you.

4944
03:37:56,780 --> 03:37:58,220
I mean, at this rate that...

4945
03:37:58,220 --> 03:38:06,760
Okay, not gonna lie, at the rate that demons are aging, like, is it gonna take fucking forever for them to grow up to be old enough to be a king?

4946
03:38:07,060 --> 03:38:07,460
Okay.

4947
03:38:10,340 --> 03:38:13,020
At least the king is like, actually an adult.

4948
03:38:13,320 --> 03:38:17,320
I don't know how many more years I have to wait for Beelzebub to fucking be an adult.

4949
03:38:17,800 --> 03:38:18,740
Here we go.

4950
03:38:22,080 --> 03:38:22,600
Okay.

4951
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:24,260
I gotta go this way.

4952
03:38:25,900 --> 03:38:27,000
Can't believe it.

4953
03:38:27,060 --> 03:38:29,900
It's so weird not to see sad in a sad land game.

4954
03:38:35,450 --> 03:38:36,710
Guys, run faster.

4955
03:38:37,530 --> 03:38:40,350
That was like, that took so long to run.

4956
03:38:40,650 --> 03:38:41,050
Okay.

4957
03:38:41,050 --> 03:38:41,110
I'm gonna go this way.

4958
03:38:41,130 --> 03:38:41,930
You look agitated.

4959
03:38:43,790 --> 03:38:45,170
We found the princess!

4960
03:38:46,950 --> 03:38:48,130
The light jog.

4961
03:38:48,290 --> 03:38:48,930
Say no more!

4962
03:38:49,730 --> 03:38:51,410
Longo's in the command center.

4963
03:38:56,330 --> 03:38:57,210
Heard that, Prince?

4964
03:38:57,690 --> 03:38:59,090
Let's go see Longo.

4965
03:38:59,870 --> 03:39:00,150
Longo!

4966
03:39:00,690 --> 03:39:01,170
Sure.

4967
03:39:04,600 --> 03:39:06,000
How would his sister be?

4968
03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:07,300
Well, I mean, she's Lilith.

4969
03:39:07,400 --> 03:39:09,060
Lilith is considered the first demon.

4970
03:39:10,920 --> 03:39:12,100
In lore history.

4971
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:12,760
In lore.

4972
03:39:13,400 --> 03:39:15,260
I know that from Supernatural.

4973
03:39:19,000 --> 03:39:23,860
So, like, if Lilith's the first demon, then obviously she's old, old.

4974
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:28,720
Let's see.

4975
03:39:28,860 --> 03:39:29,400
It's this way.

4976
03:39:39,390 --> 03:39:49,230
Yeah, but Lucifer wasn't originally a demon.

4977
03:39:51,310 --> 03:39:52,750
Lucifer was a fallen angel.

4978
03:39:53,290 --> 03:39:54,810
If you're only a galena's a hound, please head to the base as well.

4979
03:40:03,870 --> 03:40:06,830
Yeah, I know my demon lore!

4980
03:40:08,370 --> 03:40:10,950
I used to watch Supernatural.

4981
03:40:11,470 --> 03:40:13,130
And also Asmodeus.

4982
03:40:18,450 --> 03:40:20,810
We don't talk about that one.

4983
03:40:26,410 --> 03:40:26,730
Okay.

4984
03:40:27,030 --> 03:40:27,510
Well.

4985
03:40:31,130 --> 03:40:35,530
Biblical history is not an anime game.

4986
03:40:37,010 --> 03:40:38,150
Okay, let's see.

4987
03:40:38,250 --> 03:40:39,590
We gotta...

4988
03:40:40,730 --> 03:40:41,610
What did he say?

4989
03:40:41,790 --> 03:40:43,430
Oh, I'm talking about Supernatural.

4990
03:40:44,910 --> 03:40:46,370
Oh, god, thank you.

4991
03:40:46,370 --> 03:40:47,190
Nya Jin Boo.

4992
03:40:47,750 --> 03:40:48,930
Wait, you're here too?

4993
03:40:50,230 --> 03:40:51,990
But, I mean, I have a lot.

4994
03:40:52,870 --> 03:40:54,350
But where are these places?

4995
03:40:56,370 --> 03:40:59,010
What the fuck is the Moppin' region?

4996
03:41:02,610 --> 03:41:04,530
Alright, we go this way.

4997
03:41:05,370 --> 03:41:06,270
Where is it?

4998
03:41:06,570 --> 03:41:08,150
My god, it's a whole new land.

4999
03:41:10,810 --> 03:41:11,430
Let's see.

5000
03:41:11,850 --> 03:41:13,310
Wait, I can't call a ride ride?

5001
03:41:13,310 --> 03:41:14,230
Not to use my legs?

5002
03:41:14,830 --> 03:41:15,270
No!

5003
03:41:17,330 --> 03:41:19,830
Not to use my legs like a peasant?

5004
03:41:20,390 --> 03:41:21,870
I am a prince!

5005
03:41:24,350 --> 03:41:25,330
I can't believe it!

5006
03:41:26,090 --> 03:41:28,030
Like these regular people.

5007
03:41:28,590 --> 03:41:31,290
God damn it, I'm gonna ride the fucking dinosaur at this rate.

5008
03:41:34,490 --> 03:41:35,850
Oh my god.

5009
03:41:36,330 --> 03:41:39,990
I thought use my legs like the commoners.

5010
03:41:40,410 --> 03:41:41,650
Like the humans.

5011
03:41:42,970 --> 03:41:44,330
Can't believe it.

5012
03:41:45,090 --> 03:41:48,050
My feet should not be touching the dirty ground.

5013
03:41:51,170 --> 03:41:52,250
What do you mean?

5014
03:41:52,310 --> 03:41:54,250
They're literally the same creatures, but...

5015
03:41:54,350 --> 03:41:55,110
different colors.

5016
03:41:57,190 --> 03:41:58,530
Like what?

5017
03:41:59,650 --> 03:42:00,370
What do you mean?

5018
03:42:00,370 --> 03:42:02,890
There could be totally different kinds of demons here too?

5019
03:42:04,110 --> 03:42:04,830
Well...

5020
03:42:04,830 --> 03:42:07,410
I don't know about that.

5021
03:42:07,930 --> 03:42:09,490
Like what do you mean?

5022
03:42:09,690 --> 03:42:14,290
They're literally like the same kind of creatures, just like different colors.

5023
03:42:14,810 --> 03:42:16,050
The sand cat.

5024
03:42:16,370 --> 03:42:20,330
The forest land cat is brown instead of black.

5025
03:42:20,650 --> 03:42:24,330
And then the raptors are like purple instead of red.

5026
03:42:24,350 --> 03:42:25,350
And like...

5027
03:42:25,350 --> 03:42:27,330
Apparently the blue...

5028
03:42:27,330 --> 03:42:30,070
The blue raptors are everywhere apparently.

5029
03:42:31,310 --> 03:42:32,230
What the fuck?

5030
03:42:32,290 --> 03:42:32,890
Oh that's a monkey.

5031
03:42:33,130 --> 03:42:34,770
I was like what the fuck is that?

5032
03:42:36,530 --> 03:42:38,390
We don't need ores guys.

5033
03:42:38,710 --> 03:42:40,410
Okay now I should be able to ride my bike.

5034
03:42:40,410 --> 03:42:40,690
Get away.

5035
03:42:41,190 --> 03:42:42,450
My bike is faster.

5036
03:42:42,450 --> 03:42:43,290
I'm sorry raptor.

5037
03:42:44,010 --> 03:42:45,890
My bike is a lot faster.

5038
03:42:50,490 --> 03:42:51,610
Oh no!

5039
03:42:51,850 --> 03:42:53,450
I didn't wear a helmet!

5040
03:42:54,390 --> 03:42:56,150
Must be densely populated.

5041
03:42:58,510 --> 03:42:59,230
What's that?

5042
03:42:59,350 --> 03:42:59,930
Is that human?

5043
03:43:00,230 --> 03:43:01,070
Oh that's human.

5044
03:43:01,650 --> 03:43:03,050
That was a human.

5045
03:43:03,750 --> 03:43:08,490
Sorry I don't see monkeys in sad land so it's like it's an actual new species for me.

5046
03:43:09,790 --> 03:43:10,970
I was like whoa!

5047
03:43:11,690 --> 03:43:12,750
That exists?

5048
03:43:13,130 --> 03:43:14,270
Wait what's over there?

5049
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:16,310
It has to be like loot.

5050
03:43:17,990 --> 03:43:19,230
Usually they're loot.

5051
03:43:21,110 --> 03:43:21,670
Alright.

5052
03:43:23,170 --> 03:43:24,630
Get over here.

5053
03:43:24,870 --> 03:43:26,510
Yay free stuff!

5054
03:43:27,890 --> 03:43:28,810
Yay!

5055
03:43:33,710 --> 03:43:35,550
This is...

5056
03:43:35,550 --> 03:43:38,430
Oh I got poisonous mushrooms?

5057
03:43:38,970 --> 03:43:40,190
Oh my god.

5058
03:43:42,430 --> 03:43:43,350
Okay.

5059
03:43:46,610 --> 03:43:47,530
Alright.

5060
03:43:47,710 --> 03:43:50,430
What can I do with a poisonous mushroom?

5061
03:43:50,730 --> 03:43:51,650
I don't know.

5062
03:43:51,650 --> 03:43:52,910
It's this way.

5063
03:43:53,030 --> 03:43:53,490
Yay!

5064
03:43:55,770 --> 03:43:56,710
Then where do I go?

5065
03:43:56,990 --> 03:43:58,870
Oh I have to go back here anyway.

5066
03:43:59,970 --> 03:44:00,530
Alright.

5067
03:44:02,130 --> 03:44:04,610
Now I'm curious what other lands they have.

5068
03:44:05,010 --> 03:44:10,230
Cuz you know I thought they would like follow the conventional naming sequence they gave us.

5069
03:44:10,390 --> 03:44:10,870
Like you know.

5070
03:44:11,170 --> 03:44:12,010
Sand land.

5071
03:44:12,470 --> 03:44:13,330
Forest land.

5072
03:44:13,830 --> 03:44:17,850
And you would think the next land would be like ocean land or something.

5073
03:44:18,190 --> 03:44:19,690
Or like I don't know.

5074
03:44:20,270 --> 03:44:21,550
Something... Oh wait what's this?

5075
03:44:23,250 --> 03:44:24,030
Woah!

5076
03:44:24,530 --> 03:44:25,790
Who are you?

5077
03:44:27,750 --> 03:44:28,950
Mountain land.

5078
03:44:31,250 --> 03:44:32,390
Cave land.

5079
03:44:33,690 --> 03:44:35,390
Yeah shit like that.

5080
03:44:36,290 --> 03:44:38,310
And then we get flat land.

5081
03:44:38,730 --> 03:44:39,510
Like what?

5082
03:44:43,050 --> 03:44:47,070
Okay flat land was the plot twist for me.

5083
03:44:47,350 --> 03:44:49,150
I was not expecting.

5084
03:44:49,370 --> 03:44:50,750
Or like you know snow land.

5085
03:44:51,190 --> 03:44:51,630
Or like you know snow land.

5086
03:44:51,650 --> 03:44:52,590
Snow land.

5087
03:44:52,770 --> 03:44:53,830
Ice land.

5088
03:44:54,210 --> 03:44:54,710
But then there's...

5089
03:44:54,710 --> 03:44:56,670
Now that they introduced flat land.

5090
03:44:56,930 --> 03:44:59,090
Then there could be like jagged land.

5091
03:44:59,990 --> 03:45:01,070
Bumpy land.

5092
03:45:06,390 --> 03:45:10,150
Like now there's like bouncy land.

5093
03:45:14,210 --> 03:45:16,170
There's so many different lands.

5094
03:45:17,890 --> 03:45:19,150
Do I go up?

5095
03:45:21,650 --> 03:45:23,050
Oh good advice.

5096
03:45:23,550 --> 03:45:24,910
I'll give that a try.

5097
03:45:25,370 --> 03:45:26,470
Up we go.

5098
03:45:26,710 --> 03:45:28,930
I'm so happy we're finally here.

5099
03:45:29,830 --> 03:45:31,950
I don't have to see sand anymore.

5100
03:45:34,050 --> 03:45:36,470
Took forever to get here.

5101
03:45:38,210 --> 03:45:39,230
Is this way?

5102
03:45:42,410 --> 03:45:43,390
Alright nice.

5103
03:45:44,490 --> 03:45:45,390
Holy shit.

5104
03:45:45,430 --> 03:45:47,050
How far away is it?

5105
03:45:47,170 --> 03:45:48,510
This is a whole new area.

5106
03:45:48,510 --> 03:45:50,830
Oh my god this map is actually huge.

5107
03:45:54,230 --> 03:45:55,330
That's why it was destroyed.

5108
03:45:56,210 --> 03:45:58,850
It didn't fit the criteria of what a land was.

5109
03:46:04,210 --> 03:46:05,450
Oh my god there's roads.

5110
03:46:06,210 --> 03:46:08,350
Guys they have actual roads.

5111
03:46:08,390 --> 03:46:09,530
They're so advanced.

5112
03:46:13,270 --> 03:46:13,950
Ow.

5113
03:46:17,210 --> 03:46:18,310
Oh my god.

5114
03:46:18,510 --> 03:46:19,450
My car can...

5115
03:46:19,450 --> 03:46:20,950
I forgot.

5116
03:46:21,250 --> 03:46:24,050
Guys I forgot I don't get fall damage.

5117
03:46:24,270 --> 03:46:26,230
But my car gets fall damage.

5118
03:46:26,350 --> 03:46:26,850
Whoa goodbye.

5119
03:46:28,230 --> 03:46:28,990
This is bad.

5120
03:46:30,010 --> 03:46:30,730
No.

5121
03:46:36,110 --> 03:46:37,310
How much more?

5122
03:46:37,510 --> 03:46:40,630
I forgot my car gets fall damage.

5123
03:46:44,070 --> 03:46:45,750
Okay it's okay.

5124
03:46:45,930 --> 03:46:49,170
It's not like we don't have to go back too much.

5125
03:46:49,930 --> 03:46:51,070
Alright don't.

5126
03:46:51,410 --> 03:46:53,370
Don't drive off the cliff this time.

5127
03:46:55,290 --> 03:46:58,170
As long as I don't drive off the cliff we'll be fine.

5128
03:46:58,210 --> 03:46:58,630
Chat.

5129
03:46:58,910 --> 03:46:59,670
I learned.

5130
03:47:01,790 --> 03:47:02,670
Wait what's that?

5131
03:47:04,990 --> 03:47:09,350
I bet they train on the assumption that war could break out at any moment.

5132
03:47:09,670 --> 03:47:10,530
Bro that's fucked up.

5133
03:47:10,770 --> 03:47:14,750
That mindset alone might explain the difference in strength between them and the royal army.

5134
03:47:15,130 --> 03:47:16,150
Oh my god.

5135
03:47:17,890 --> 03:47:19,850
They're like an actual military.

5136
03:47:23,050 --> 03:47:24,470
Oh the swimmers are here.

5137
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:26,070
How did they get here so fast?

5138
03:47:28,390 --> 03:47:29,290
Hello guys.

5139
03:47:31,450 --> 03:47:32,310
Hey guys.

5140
03:47:33,950 --> 03:47:35,710
I knew you would come.

5141
03:47:35,850 --> 03:47:36,550
You guys are so fast.

5142
03:47:37,450 --> 03:47:39,510
You really did show up huh?

5143
03:47:39,810 --> 03:47:40,410
Of course.

5144
03:47:41,030 --> 03:47:42,130
You got a problem with that?

5145
03:47:42,190 --> 03:47:42,970
I gotta help Anne.

5146
03:47:43,330 --> 03:47:45,570
Although I sort of just want to keep Polack.

5147
03:47:45,830 --> 03:47:46,270
Hm.

5148
03:47:46,490 --> 03:47:47,950
Polack is a better Anne.

5149
03:47:48,290 --> 03:47:49,070
What's the situation?

5150
03:47:49,350 --> 03:47:49,830
I'm not sure.

5151
03:47:49,850 --> 03:47:52,190
As bad as it could get.

5152
03:47:52,870 --> 03:47:55,510
Supreme Commander Bread just arrived at Anmiel base.

5153
03:47:56,430 --> 03:47:59,250
We believe he's there to take custody of Anne.

5154
03:48:00,510 --> 03:48:03,550
A missing princess suddenly returned a decade later.

5155
03:48:04,130 --> 03:48:07,750
I can see how that would merit the attention of the Supreme Commander himself.

5156
03:48:08,890 --> 03:48:11,110
What happens if he does take her with him?

5157
03:48:13,810 --> 03:48:17,530
She'll become a figurehead to prop up the legitimacy of Bread's rule.

5158
03:48:17,530 --> 03:48:21,330
Or else a scapegoat to turn the people against the royalists.

5159
03:48:22,050 --> 03:48:25,190
Either way, she'll be nothing but a pawn.

5160
03:48:25,730 --> 03:48:29,030
Then we have to get the princess back sooner rather than later.

5161
03:48:29,030 --> 03:48:29,810
Just let her escape again.

5162
03:48:30,090 --> 03:48:31,890
She's so good at just running away.

5163
03:48:32,350 --> 03:48:33,550
The basis of our plan has been alert since Bread's arrival.

5164
03:48:34,310 --> 03:48:37,770
We stand no chance if we try to take them head on.

5165
03:48:38,450 --> 03:48:41,610
Mr. Rao, how would you approach this problem?

5166
03:48:42,590 --> 03:48:43,150
Simple.

5167
03:48:43,610 --> 03:48:44,730
Divide and conquer.

5168
03:48:46,010 --> 03:48:47,510
We have the bulk of our forces.

5169
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:48,670
Draw the enemy's attention.

5170
03:48:48,910 --> 03:48:51,190
The bulk of our forces?

5171
03:48:51,810 --> 03:48:53,070
You mean like two of us?

5172
03:48:56,330 --> 03:48:57,790
Where's the bulk?

5173
03:48:58,550 --> 03:49:01,690
There's literally like ten of us here.

5174
03:49:03,330 --> 03:49:05,450
Doug, thank you for the super chat.

5175
03:49:05,790 --> 03:49:07,410
Look at the fortress!

5176
03:49:07,470 --> 03:49:10,250
They have turrets!

5177
03:49:11,550 --> 03:49:14,690
They literally have turrets on the castle.

5178
03:49:14,810 --> 03:49:16,930
What do you mean the bulk of us?

5179
03:49:17,530 --> 03:49:18,670
Doug, thank you for the super chat.

5180
03:49:19,450 --> 03:49:20,130
What's this?

5181
03:49:20,290 --> 03:49:22,810
Well-paid roads, fresh trees and water?

5182
03:49:23,030 --> 03:49:24,410
A functioning society?

5183
03:49:24,850 --> 03:49:26,710
This is all forest land propaganda.

5184
03:49:27,390 --> 03:49:28,950
Don't believe the lies.

5185
03:49:28,970 --> 03:49:31,050
How do you choose for the stealth operation?

5186
03:49:32,250 --> 03:49:33,590
You want a crack squad?

5187
03:49:33,950 --> 03:49:36,170
You can't get more crack than the swimmers.

5188
03:49:36,170 --> 03:49:37,610
They have satellite TV!

5189
03:49:38,130 --> 03:49:39,370
What the fuck?

5190
03:49:39,770 --> 03:49:42,150
If you want a crack fighter, you come to me.

5191
03:49:42,430 --> 03:49:42,750
Bro.

5192
03:49:43,630 --> 03:49:47,310
It sounds like being a sad lander is a good thing.

5193
03:49:47,310 --> 03:49:50,230
We don't have time to argue.

5194
03:49:50,410 --> 03:49:51,870
I'll choose the teams myself.

5195
03:49:52,930 --> 03:49:56,870
Mr. Rao, will you command the infiltration team?

5196
03:49:57,410 --> 03:49:58,430
Of course.

5197
03:49:59,310 --> 03:50:01,990
I think I want to be a forest lander, guys.

5198
03:50:02,270 --> 03:50:03,970
Guys, the propaganda is working.

5199
03:50:04,050 --> 03:50:04,450
Chat.

5200
03:50:05,670 --> 03:50:07,150
I saw the satellite.

5201
03:50:09,290 --> 03:50:10,710
Not you either.

5202
03:50:15,130 --> 03:50:17,010
We can't delay a moment longer.

5203
03:50:17,090 --> 03:50:17,290
We have to go.

5204
03:50:17,290 --> 03:50:18,690
I feel like...

5205
03:50:19,290 --> 03:50:20,190
I feel like...

5206
03:50:20,190 --> 03:50:23,250
Forest land is like the UK.

5207
03:50:23,650 --> 03:50:25,670
And the sand land is Australia.

5208
03:50:26,170 --> 03:50:27,470
And the forest land like...

5209
03:50:27,470 --> 03:50:29,410
shipped the criminals to sand land.

5210
03:50:29,790 --> 03:50:30,310
Yes, sir!

5211
03:50:30,530 --> 03:50:32,490
They don't even have the junkers.

5212
03:50:32,630 --> 03:50:34,910
They don't even have the junkers here.

5213
03:50:35,970 --> 03:50:36,850
We're heading out.

5214
03:50:43,770 --> 03:50:44,690
Here we go.

5215
03:50:45,950 --> 03:50:46,850
Let's see.

5216
03:50:48,610 --> 03:50:50,710
It's like the origin of Australia.

5217
03:50:51,110 --> 03:50:51,710
It's like the origin of Australia.

5218
03:50:53,810 --> 03:50:56,050
What the fuck is going on here?

5219
03:50:56,150 --> 03:50:56,790
Oh shit.

5220
03:50:56,830 --> 03:50:57,730
What the fuck?

5221
03:50:57,910 --> 03:50:58,430
Bro.

5222
03:50:59,270 --> 03:51:00,090
Grandpa's tank.

5223
03:51:00,350 --> 03:51:04,110
Guys, that's the bulk of our forces, guys.

5224
03:51:08,230 --> 03:51:10,830
Guys, the bulk of our forces is doing it.

5225
03:51:11,190 --> 03:51:12,690
All five of them.

5226
03:51:13,510 --> 03:51:15,730
Lots of soldiers in this area.

5227
03:51:16,750 --> 03:51:18,670
Keep a close eye on your surroundings.

5228
03:51:21,150 --> 03:51:21,710
Keep a close eye on your surroundings.

5229
03:51:21,730 --> 03:51:22,750
Alright, don't worry.

5230
03:51:22,790 --> 03:51:23,790
I'm keeping a close eye.

5231
03:51:25,610 --> 03:51:26,730
Wrong way.

5232
03:51:27,290 --> 03:51:28,490
There's like no security.

5233
03:51:28,730 --> 03:51:31,030
The bulk of our forces...

5234
03:51:31,730 --> 03:51:34,290
dragged like the five other people.

5235
03:51:34,370 --> 03:51:35,390
to get in...

5236
03:51:35,390 --> 03:51:36,670
in forest land.

5237
03:51:37,370 --> 03:51:39,030
Just enters through the front.

5238
03:51:39,130 --> 03:51:39,290
Yeah!

5239
03:51:40,190 --> 03:51:41,270
That's my security.

5240
03:51:43,650 --> 03:51:44,630
We did it.

5241
03:51:44,770 --> 03:51:45,530
That was easy.

5242
03:51:45,890 --> 03:51:47,450
We'll attract too much attention...

5243
03:51:47,450 --> 03:51:48,790
if all three of us move together.

5244
03:51:50,250 --> 03:51:51,290
Let's split up.

5245
03:51:51,730 --> 03:51:53,750
Prince, we'll use your telepathy to communicate.

5246
03:51:54,430 --> 03:51:54,990
Okay.

5247
03:51:55,890 --> 03:51:57,410
Wait, I forgot I have that power.

5248
03:51:57,670 --> 03:51:58,890
Don't you dare suddenly go...

5249
03:51:58,890 --> 03:52:01,130
in our heads to make us jump.

5250
03:52:02,070 --> 03:52:02,890
Yeah, yeah.

5251
03:52:05,990 --> 03:52:06,910
I guess...

5252
03:52:06,910 --> 03:52:09,350
It's like, you know, like a dozen is twelve?

5253
03:52:10,970 --> 03:52:12,030
So like...

5254
03:52:12,030 --> 03:52:14,730
In like...

5255
03:52:14,730 --> 03:52:17,190
In like the Sandland World's term...

5256
03:52:17,190 --> 03:52:17,670
Oh shit.

5257
03:52:18,730 --> 03:52:20,930
In like Sandland World terms...

5258
03:52:21,730 --> 03:52:22,590
The bulk is like five.

5259
03:52:24,090 --> 03:52:25,450
You were careful.

5260
03:52:25,750 --> 03:52:27,290
Whoops, I forgot about...

5261
03:52:27,290 --> 03:52:29,950
I forgot about the sneaking part of this game.

5262
03:52:33,410 --> 03:52:34,990
Wait, oh there's a guy here.

5263
03:52:35,390 --> 03:52:36,950
Wait, this is actually difficult.

5264
03:52:37,370 --> 03:52:37,850
Oh no.

5265
03:52:40,170 --> 03:52:41,790
If I just walk up this way...

5266
03:52:46,670 --> 03:52:47,190
Oh!

5267
03:52:47,510 --> 03:52:47,850
What?

5268
03:52:47,910 --> 03:52:48,890
Sorry, I didn't see you!

5269
03:52:49,290 --> 03:52:50,890
I thought I could kill him!

5270
03:52:51,990 --> 03:52:52,670
It's okay.

5271
03:52:52,750 --> 03:52:52,890
No.

5272
03:52:52,970 --> 03:52:53,270
I got this.

5273
03:52:53,290 --> 03:52:53,510
I got this guy.

5274
03:52:53,610 --> 03:52:54,030
Watch this.

5275
03:52:54,230 --> 03:52:56,210
Gotta be more careful.

5276
03:52:56,430 --> 03:52:57,370
Watch this guys.

5277
03:52:57,890 --> 03:52:59,930
And then sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

5278
03:53:00,570 --> 03:53:01,950
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

5279
03:53:03,790 --> 03:53:04,710
There you go.

5280
03:53:06,450 --> 03:53:06,930
Nice.

5281
03:53:06,990 --> 03:53:07,970
I scared him to death.

5282
03:53:08,610 --> 03:53:09,090
Alright.

5283
03:53:10,330 --> 03:53:11,630
See, it's that easy.

5284
03:53:13,050 --> 03:53:15,270
Look, he can't see me if I just...

5285
03:53:15,270 --> 03:53:15,530
No!

5286
03:53:16,950 --> 03:53:18,790
He can see ahead of you!

5287
03:53:21,110 --> 03:53:22,570
No way!

5288
03:53:23,250 --> 03:53:27,070
No way!

5289
03:53:27,070 --> 03:53:28,490
I can't believe it.

5290
03:53:28,510 --> 03:53:29,870
He can see like...

5291
03:53:29,870 --> 03:53:31,290
5 feet ahead.

5292
03:53:32,950 --> 03:53:34,290
He has eyes?

5293
03:53:37,050 --> 03:53:38,430
There's no way!

5294
03:53:39,390 --> 03:53:40,730
That should be illegal.

5295
03:53:44,540 --> 03:53:47,030
So he can't see 5 feet ahead?

5296
03:53:47,210 --> 03:53:47,910
That's not fair!

5297
03:53:50,310 --> 03:53:52,010
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

5298
03:53:53,250 --> 03:53:53,930
Turn around!

5299
03:53:55,950 --> 03:53:56,470
Turn around!

5300
03:53:56,990 --> 03:53:59,230
Turn around!

5301
03:54:00,710 --> 03:54:01,170
Yeah.

5302
03:54:01,590 --> 03:54:03,670
I don't know what he said, but yeah.

5303
03:54:04,350 --> 03:54:04,470
I don't know what he said, but yeah.

5304
03:54:05,070 --> 03:54:07,030
He's busy trying to sneak through here.

5305
03:54:07,170 --> 03:54:08,950
Oh my god, please crawl faster.

5306
03:54:09,790 --> 03:54:10,590
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5307
03:54:10,770 --> 03:54:10,950
Okay.

5308
03:54:12,570 --> 03:54:13,450
Don't turn around.

5309
03:54:15,130 --> 03:54:16,590
Okay, we gotta sneak up.

5310
03:54:16,690 --> 03:54:17,730
And then we should make it.

5311
03:54:19,790 --> 03:54:20,650
Get over here.

5312
03:54:22,530 --> 03:54:23,290
Nice, alright.

5313
03:54:23,490 --> 03:54:24,630
Now we can run.

5314
03:54:24,930 --> 03:54:25,370
Yeah!

5315
03:54:26,150 --> 03:54:27,090
We made it!

5316
03:54:27,730 --> 03:54:29,310
Can I throw my tank now?

5317
03:54:34,110 --> 03:54:34,670
Whoa!

5318
03:54:36,590 --> 03:54:37,810
That's a lot of people!

5319
03:54:43,430 --> 03:54:45,790
Oh, he looks like that Gundam character.

5320
03:54:48,790 --> 03:54:55,970
For he is the same hero who struck down the fiend that beguiled our former king.

5321
03:54:57,610 --> 03:55:03,630
Our king will be none other than our champion, the valiant Munia!

5322
03:55:03,890 --> 03:55:04,730
This guy?

5323
03:55:06,830 --> 03:55:08,510
That's a little boy!

5324
03:55:09,010 --> 03:55:09,510
Munia!

5325
03:55:09,730 --> 03:55:10,490
Munia!

5326
03:55:11,030 --> 03:55:11,910
Munia!

5327
03:55:11,910 --> 03:55:11,990
Munia!

5328
03:55:11,990 --> 03:55:13,290
That's Munial?

5329
03:55:13,750 --> 03:55:17,370
You mean my sis lost her hair?

5330
03:55:17,370 --> 03:55:18,430
Yeah, I was gonna say.

5331
03:55:18,750 --> 03:55:20,410
Your sister lost her that?

5332
03:55:20,890 --> 03:55:21,390
Munia!

5333
03:55:21,830 --> 03:55:22,470
Munia!

5334
03:55:22,830 --> 03:55:23,470
Munia!

5335
03:55:23,910 --> 03:55:26,450
This has to be some kind of mistake.

5336
03:55:26,830 --> 03:55:28,290
There's no way!

5337
03:55:28,910 --> 03:55:29,050
What?

5338
03:55:29,310 --> 03:55:30,630
Glad I cared that out.

5339
03:55:32,640 --> 03:55:34,220
We left this child here.

5340
03:55:35,260 --> 03:55:35,700
Oh my god.

5341
03:55:35,700 --> 03:55:36,480
Brave soldiers.

5342
03:55:36,700 --> 03:55:37,380
Even my own.

5343
03:55:37,980 --> 03:55:40,000
They have listened.

5344
03:55:43,240 --> 03:55:45,180
Man, what's been right!

5345
03:55:45,180 --> 03:55:46,440
I'm starting to listen to his voice.

5346
03:55:46,920 --> 03:55:48,820
I can't wait to try them out.

5347
03:55:49,220 --> 03:55:50,440
But guess now.

5348
03:55:50,680 --> 03:55:50,860
It's not the time.

5349
03:55:51,820 --> 03:55:54,260
Munial has refused to claim the title of king for himself.

5350
03:55:54,260 --> 03:55:55,720
Sounds like a fucking dweeb.

5351
03:55:55,840 --> 03:55:57,680
I think he is no more than a steward of the power.

5352
03:56:02,720 --> 03:56:03,180
Woo!

5353
03:56:03,860 --> 03:56:05,380
Guess I won't go that way!

5354
03:56:06,320 --> 03:56:07,980
Wait, can I drop down?

5355
03:56:08,620 --> 03:56:10,700
Oh man, we won't hold the coronation at once.

5356
03:56:10,740 --> 03:56:14,800
And when the crown rests upon us, we're on sand land!

5357
03:56:15,540 --> 03:56:16,000
No!

5358
03:56:20,560 --> 03:56:21,020
Guys!

5359
03:56:21,160 --> 03:56:23,120
Get the clear war on sand land, guys!

5360
03:56:23,780 --> 03:56:24,980
We really want so badly.

5361
03:56:29,920 --> 03:56:31,040
Oh my god.

5362
03:56:32,640 --> 03:56:33,600
Okay, to be fair.

5363
03:56:33,660 --> 03:56:34,680
It's not even gonna be a war.

5364
03:56:34,700 --> 03:56:37,240
It's gonna be like much of a challenge against sand land.

5365
03:56:37,440 --> 03:56:42,720
Like comparing what they have versus what we have.

5366
03:56:43,140 --> 03:56:45,760
I mean, at least we have demons, I guess.

5367
03:56:46,200 --> 03:56:48,280
Like we have demons in sand land.

5368
03:56:50,080 --> 03:56:51,080
On our side.

5369
03:56:51,540 --> 03:56:52,160
Can you open it?

5370
03:56:53,120 --> 03:56:53,980
Not a problem!

5371
03:56:55,120 --> 03:56:56,280
Oh hey, there's Anne!

5372
03:56:56,620 --> 03:56:57,200
Hey Anne!

5373
03:56:57,640 --> 03:57:00,880
I probably shouldn't go too crazy inside the base.

5374
03:57:01,180 --> 03:57:02,560
Why would you want sand land for?

5375
03:57:02,760 --> 03:57:04,680
Like do you really want to go crazy inside the base?

5376
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:07,160
I don't want the territory of sand land.

5377
03:57:07,260 --> 03:57:08,280
All we have is sand.

5378
03:57:09,800 --> 03:57:12,120
Aren't we supposed to share an emotional...

5379
03:57:12,120 --> 03:57:14,100
You literally have trees and water.

5380
03:57:14,340 --> 03:57:14,760
Aren't we supposed to share an emotional...

5381
03:57:14,760 --> 03:57:16,600
We just got water like two days ago.

5382
03:57:17,300 --> 03:57:18,360
Ew, gross.

5383
03:57:21,080 --> 03:57:23,360
Alright, let's hurry up and get out of here.

5384
03:57:24,320 --> 03:57:26,480
Our people are always dehydrated.

5385
03:57:26,500 --> 03:57:29,100
Wait, can we stop by the command center?

5386
03:57:30,900 --> 03:57:31,460
Why?

5387
03:57:31,680 --> 03:57:32,260
The command center?

5388
03:57:32,260 --> 03:57:33,960
What do you need to go there for?

5389
03:57:34,920 --> 03:57:37,560
Imagine all the glasses you can make.

5390
03:57:37,800 --> 03:57:38,500
I've already set the soldiers off.

5391
03:57:39,240 --> 03:57:41,360
That's where the Aquanium radar...

5392
03:57:41,360 --> 03:57:42,140
하는れる 메시지.

5393
03:57:42,140 --> 03:57:42,980
Guys, we have...

5394
03:57:42,980 --> 03:57:46,940
We have the people in forrest land...

5395
03:57:46,940 --> 03:57:48,380
who needs their glasses!

5396
03:57:49,280 --> 03:57:49,680
WHO DOESN'T?

5397
03:57:49,680 --> 03:57:52,500
Really, that's well worth a visit then.

5398
03:57:53,480 --> 03:57:54,080
REALLY, THAT'S WELL WORTH A VISIT THEN.

5399
03:57:54,080 --> 03:57:55,180
I object.

5400
03:57:55,560 --> 03:57:59,620
The command center must have the heaviest security in the entire base.

5401
03:58:05,800 --> 03:58:09,140
There is a shortage of glass!

5402
03:58:10,820 --> 03:58:12,760
It's the only way!

5403
03:58:19,740 --> 03:58:21,740
Hey, time to...

5404
03:58:21,740 --> 03:58:23,400
Time to go...

5405
03:58:23,400 --> 03:58:25,120
Go grab...

5406
03:58:25,840 --> 03:58:28,320
Time to go grab the Aquanium radar.

5407
03:58:31,160 --> 03:58:32,660
Wait, does that make you go downstairs?

5408
03:58:36,480 --> 03:58:38,320
Oh, there's no... nothing downstairs.

5409
03:58:38,760 --> 03:58:39,620
That's a lot!

5410
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:42,800
If you put a downstairs, you should have at least one chest downstairs.

5411
03:58:43,460 --> 03:58:44,820
What the fuck is this bullshit?

5412
03:58:51,480 --> 03:58:54,860
Are we splitting up?

5413
03:58:55,920 --> 03:58:57,500
Let's split up, gang!

5414
03:58:57,740 --> 03:58:59,200
It's always worked in Scooby Doo.

5415
03:59:02,120 --> 03:59:03,020
Oh, okay, they're all gone.

5416
03:59:03,140 --> 03:59:03,760
Alright, that's cool.

5417
03:59:05,200 --> 03:59:06,980
That was fast, but okay.

5418
03:59:08,200 --> 03:59:09,020
Alright, gang.

5419
03:59:09,300 --> 03:59:10,800
We split up so fast.

5420
03:59:11,700 --> 03:59:12,500
Wait, what?

5421
03:59:12,800 --> 03:59:14,300
There's no point in me...

5422
03:59:14,880 --> 03:59:15,720
doing that.

5423
03:59:18,500 --> 03:59:19,740
They looked up!

5424
03:59:21,060 --> 03:59:22,180
Prepare for trouble!

5425
03:59:22,420 --> 03:59:23,440
And make it double!

5426
03:59:24,300 --> 03:59:25,520
They can look up?

5427
03:59:25,800 --> 03:59:28,160
Gotta be more careful.

5428
03:59:28,800 --> 03:59:30,260
What if I go up?

5429
03:59:30,300 --> 03:59:30,800
What if I go up?

5430
03:59:32,120 --> 03:59:33,940
This is the speedrun strat, guys.

5431
03:59:35,840 --> 03:59:36,700
Wait, it is.

5432
03:59:39,380 --> 03:59:39,900
Okay.

5433
03:59:41,180 --> 03:59:42,540
All I have to do...

5434
03:59:42,540 --> 03:59:44,540
was I go this way...

5435
03:59:44,540 --> 03:59:45,320
Here we go.

5436
03:59:45,800 --> 03:59:46,680
Here we go.

5437
03:59:47,900 --> 03:59:49,780
And then I go this way...

5438
03:59:50,480 --> 03:59:51,880
And then I run!

5439
03:59:53,220 --> 03:59:54,540
I told you!

5440
03:59:54,580 --> 03:59:55,480
It's the speedrun strat!

5441
03:59:56,420 --> 03:59:59,960
Some soldiers noticed the tip of my hair poking out from cover.

5442
04:00:00,200 --> 04:00:01,620
I was almost spotted.

5443
04:00:01,840 --> 04:00:02,100
I was almost spotted.

5444
04:00:02,120 --> 04:00:05,080
Maybe you shouldn't have spiked it up so stupidly tall.

5445
04:00:05,940 --> 04:00:07,420
What do you mean, stupid?

5446
04:00:07,900 --> 04:00:09,640
This is the height of fashion!

5447
04:00:09,760 --> 04:00:09,920
Yeah!

5448
04:00:11,140 --> 04:00:13,040
Anyhow, we all made it to the rendezvous.

5449
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:13,280
Where?

5450
04:00:13,500 --> 04:00:14,100
Let's keep moving.

5451
04:00:14,100 --> 04:00:15,920
Who else has their hair like that?

5452
04:00:16,180 --> 04:00:17,500
That's what fashion is!

5453
04:00:17,900 --> 04:00:20,580
If you're the only one wearing that, it's not fashion!

5454
04:00:26,430 --> 04:00:26,910
Alright.

5455
04:00:27,050 --> 04:00:28,150
Yay, elevators!

5456
04:00:28,250 --> 04:00:29,970
At least they also have elevators.

5457
04:00:31,650 --> 04:00:32,130
Alright.

5458
04:00:32,630 --> 04:00:34,150
Where the fuck is the radar?

5459
04:00:37,250 --> 04:00:37,910
I don't know.

5460
04:00:37,910 --> 04:00:39,910
I feel like there's going to be a boss right here later.

5461
04:00:40,130 --> 04:00:43,990
We're going to come back here after we pick up the radar and we're going to have to fight somebody.

5462
04:00:45,650 --> 04:00:46,250
We're going to come back here after we pick up the radar and we're going to have to fight somebody.

5463
04:00:46,250 --> 04:00:47,070
It's Avon Card.

5464
04:00:48,790 --> 04:00:49,750
They're intruders!

5465
04:00:49,910 --> 04:00:50,770
Sound the alarm!

5466
04:00:52,950 --> 04:00:53,910
Yes, sir!

5467
04:00:56,850 --> 04:00:58,210
That's such a tiny gun.

5468
04:00:58,350 --> 04:01:02,190
Where did he get that gun?

5469
04:01:02,630 --> 04:01:03,250
Damn it!

5470
04:01:05,950 --> 04:01:08,150
Look at all the glass behind them.

5471
04:01:08,190 --> 04:01:08,950
You're right, guys.

5472
04:01:09,330 --> 04:01:10,910
Guys, they need it for this!

5473
04:01:16,950 --> 04:01:18,450
Where's the radar?

5474
04:01:28,580 --> 04:01:29,780
Yeah, I remember!

5475
04:01:40,120 --> 04:01:42,640
There's another one?

5476
04:01:45,720 --> 04:01:47,920
Wait, how many aquariums do they have?

5477
04:01:48,780 --> 04:01:50,080
Holy shit!

5478
04:01:51,460 --> 04:01:53,180
It's the red-eyed aquarium?

5479
04:01:54,100 --> 04:01:56,000
What the... we had two!

5480
04:01:58,680 --> 04:02:01,060
Oh my god, that's a lot!

5481
04:02:04,160 --> 04:02:07,000
Why do they need to steal from us?

5482
04:02:07,940 --> 04:02:10,820
Wait, what's the point of stealing from our stash?

5483
04:02:11,500 --> 04:02:12,620
We had two!

5484
04:02:12,640 --> 04:02:14,620
They have like 80!

5485
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:23,600
Nice!

5486
04:02:26,600 --> 04:02:27,720
Bread!

5487
04:02:31,260 --> 04:02:31,820
Bread!

5488
04:02:34,880 --> 04:02:42,860
Oh my god!

5489
04:02:42,860 --> 04:02:45,040
He's so strong!

5490
04:02:45,700 --> 04:02:48,020
How is he stronger than a demon?

5491
04:02:53,280 --> 04:02:54,840
Yeah, that's what I'm seeing!

5492
04:03:06,960 --> 04:03:08,160
It's like Tekken!

5493
04:03:08,300 --> 04:03:09,000
Hehehe!

5494
04:03:20,100 --> 04:03:21,680
He's a cyborg?

5495
04:03:22,460 --> 04:03:23,880
Is this real?

5496
04:03:24,280 --> 04:03:25,580
Not just my face.

5497
04:03:25,800 --> 04:03:33,000
I lost half of my body in battle with that horrible, wretched Commander Zeta.

5498
04:03:34,640 --> 04:03:35,400
Whoa!

5499
04:03:35,940 --> 04:03:36,040
What?

5500
04:03:37,560 --> 04:03:38,320
Damn!

5501
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:44,880
Hmm.

5502
04:03:45,100 --> 04:03:45,860
Half?

5503
04:03:45,960 --> 04:03:46,660
How is he alive?

5504
04:03:46,820 --> 04:03:47,980
Because he's a cyborg!

5505
04:03:48,060 --> 04:03:49,080
He's like...

5506
04:03:49,080 --> 04:03:51,480
Cyborgs have to lose...

5507
04:03:51,480 --> 04:03:51,720
I'm sorry.

5508
04:03:51,720 --> 04:03:53,340
Half is too much human, anyway.

5509
04:03:55,960 --> 04:03:57,120
Bro, he's a cyborg.

5510
04:03:57,180 --> 04:03:58,900
He can use his fucking cyborg eyes!

5511
04:04:00,400 --> 04:04:00,760
Huh?

5512
04:04:00,960 --> 04:04:02,320
Did you see that, Prince?

5513
04:04:02,700 --> 04:04:04,520
My quick wit at work.

5514
04:04:04,600 --> 04:04:05,280
Can I just fall down?

5515
04:04:05,720 --> 04:04:06,920
No, I can't!

5516
04:04:07,500 --> 04:04:08,440
That's fucked up!

5517
04:04:09,120 --> 04:04:09,600
Yep.

5518
04:04:09,660 --> 04:04:09,960
Ow!

5519
04:04:10,260 --> 04:04:13,140
I can't believe I can't just fall down.

5520
04:04:13,360 --> 04:04:14,700
The fashion sense saves the day again.

5521
04:04:15,900 --> 04:04:17,120
Okay, now I can jump, right?

5522
04:04:17,900 --> 04:04:18,380
No!

5523
04:04:19,300 --> 04:04:21,540
It's forcing me to use this!

5524
04:04:21,620 --> 04:04:21,700
No!

5525
04:04:21,700 --> 04:04:22,700
The stairs!

5526
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:23,660
That's it!

5527
04:04:23,920 --> 04:04:26,100
If I have to use stairs...

5528
04:04:26,390 --> 04:04:28,480
Nobody said I can't bring my tank!

5529
04:04:30,980 --> 04:04:31,680
No!

5530
04:04:31,900 --> 04:04:34,660
The stairs are not wide enough!

5531
04:04:36,880 --> 04:04:38,560
It's so messed up.

5532
04:04:38,640 --> 04:04:40,380
The stairs are not wide enough.

5533
04:04:40,540 --> 04:04:41,780
It's too thick.

5534
04:04:42,440 --> 04:04:44,940
That's it, I'm bringing the hover car.

5535
04:04:48,380 --> 04:04:50,400
I'm bringing the hover car.

5536
04:04:50,860 --> 04:04:51,680
If I can...

5537
04:04:51,700 --> 04:04:56,360
If I can't fucking bring my tank, I'll just bring the other car.

5538
04:04:58,200 --> 04:04:59,180
The stairs...

5539
04:04:59,500 --> 04:05:00,740
I can't believe it!

5540
04:05:00,760 --> 04:05:01,940
What happened to accessibility?

5541
04:05:04,380 --> 04:05:06,120
It's not accessible with my tank!

5542
04:05:07,240 --> 04:05:08,460
They don't care.

5543
04:05:12,540 --> 04:05:14,140
They're anti-tanks.

5544
04:05:22,100 --> 04:05:23,380
What are you gonna do, Rao?

5545
04:05:27,760 --> 04:05:28,160
Yeah!

5546
04:05:33,800 --> 04:05:35,280
Don't worry, I brought a car!

5547
04:05:37,680 --> 04:05:38,780
That's fucking right!

5548
04:05:39,720 --> 04:05:41,700
I paid so much money for this!

5549
04:05:43,120 --> 04:05:43,880
Okay, there you go.

5550
04:05:44,720 --> 04:05:45,500
Wait, that's a T!

5551
04:05:46,920 --> 04:05:49,180
Wait, how strong is... Okay, I'm gonna bring them out.

5552
04:05:49,340 --> 04:05:49,980
Wait, actually no.

5553
04:05:50,040 --> 04:05:51,180
These are like Teemu tanks.

5554
04:05:52,540 --> 04:05:53,980
We drop-shipped this tank.

5555
04:05:54,580 --> 04:05:55,500
So we're fine.

5556
04:05:56,780 --> 04:05:57,260
Yay!

5557
04:05:59,600 --> 04:06:01,580
Oh shit, maybe we're not fine.

5558
04:06:02,280 --> 04:06:04,320
Wait, maybe I can bring the tank over now.

5559
04:06:05,340 --> 04:06:06,840
Okay, let's see how strong...

5560
04:06:07,680 --> 04:06:08,460
Okay, nice.

5561
04:06:08,620 --> 04:06:08,840
Alright.

5562
04:06:08,980 --> 04:06:09,960
My tank is strong.

5563
04:06:10,500 --> 04:06:11,460
Tank is stronger!

5564
04:06:14,360 --> 04:06:15,980
Alright, get outta here.

5565
04:06:16,620 --> 04:06:17,740
Get outta here!

5566
04:06:19,620 --> 04:06:20,940
Wait, what else is there?

5567
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:21,680
Who else is there?

5568
04:06:21,700 --> 04:06:22,300
Who else is still alive?

5569
04:06:24,660 --> 04:06:25,500
Oh, you!

5570
04:06:26,400 --> 04:06:27,120
Get out!

5571
04:06:27,500 --> 04:06:28,780
Nobody loves you!

5572
04:06:29,540 --> 04:06:30,880
Oh, I went the wrong way.

5573
04:06:31,740 --> 04:06:32,580
Wait, what?

5574
04:06:34,440 --> 04:06:37,200
How do I get there?

5575
04:06:40,220 --> 04:06:42,340
No, I was going the right way.

5576
04:06:43,120 --> 04:06:44,640
It was the right side.

5577
04:06:44,700 --> 04:06:46,100
Sorry, the green means go.

5578
04:06:48,580 --> 04:06:50,420
Green means go, guys.

5579
04:06:54,310 --> 04:06:55,230
Leave her!

5580
04:06:56,870 --> 04:06:58,290
What are you doing, dummy?

5581
04:06:58,850 --> 04:07:00,250
S-sorry.

5582
04:07:01,570 --> 04:07:03,010
Surrender, demons!

5583
04:07:05,750 --> 04:07:07,450
Where did they come from?

5584
04:07:10,410 --> 04:07:12,050
Whoa, are you okay, Raul?

5585
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:13,790
Whoa!

5586
04:07:14,530 --> 04:07:17,490
Hey, those are the Dragon Ball bots!

5587
04:07:18,470 --> 04:07:19,750
Sorry for the wait.

5588
04:07:22,250 --> 04:07:23,430
It's not awesome, Raul.

5589
04:07:23,430 --> 04:07:24,690
That's the one I wanted to drive!

5590
04:07:25,090 --> 04:07:27,310
That's the Dragon Ball Z robot!

5591
04:07:28,710 --> 04:07:31,870
The yoke's way too sluggish for my taste.

5592
04:07:32,630 --> 04:07:33,310
Really?

5593
04:07:33,590 --> 04:07:34,130
Alright!

5594
04:07:37,810 --> 04:07:39,590
Okay, how do I do this?

5595
04:07:39,750 --> 04:07:43,990
Battle armor, boost, jump, jump while hover.

5596
04:07:44,950 --> 04:07:48,270
Why does this bot has like 200 instructions?

5597
04:07:49,150 --> 04:07:53,970
Okay, I can carry, I can melee, I can ready weapon.

5598
04:07:53,970 --> 04:07:56,570
I can, oh my, I can guard.

5599
04:07:57,030 --> 04:07:58,970
Oh my god, this is a fighting game now.

5600
04:07:59,410 --> 04:08:00,310
I can throw.

5601
04:08:00,670 --> 04:08:01,110
Okay.

5602
04:08:01,650 --> 04:08:02,090
Alright.

5603
04:08:04,090 --> 04:08:05,090
Okay, there we go.

5604
04:08:05,190 --> 04:08:06,470
All we're gonna do is...

5605
04:08:08,010 --> 04:08:09,090
Alright, I'm just gonna...

5606
04:08:10,030 --> 04:08:10,310
Nice.

5607
04:08:11,370 --> 04:08:12,990
Okay, how do I reload?

5608
04:08:13,230 --> 04:08:14,590
Okay, I'm gonna reload my...

5609
04:08:16,010 --> 04:08:16,550
Reload it.

5610
04:08:18,130 --> 04:08:19,010
Oh, shit!

5611
04:08:20,370 --> 04:08:20,970
That's right.

5612
04:08:21,250 --> 04:08:22,210
I'm gonna fight you.

5613
04:08:23,850 --> 04:08:25,090
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

5614
04:08:25,150 --> 04:08:26,610
Wait, shooting is faster.

5615
04:08:27,490 --> 04:08:29,270
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

5616
04:08:30,550 --> 04:08:34,450
Guys, you can literally try to seize the other... the two people behind you.

5617
04:08:37,310 --> 04:08:39,410
Literally those two kids behind you.

5618
04:08:39,490 --> 04:08:40,110
Pick them up.

5619
04:08:41,450 --> 04:08:43,130
Alright, I wanna see how strong...

5620
04:08:44,250 --> 04:08:45,890
Okay, how strong is my melee though?

5621
04:08:46,970 --> 04:08:47,290
Boom!

5622
04:08:47,550 --> 04:08:47,970
What the...

5623
04:08:49,390 --> 04:08:50,030
Holy shit!

5624
04:08:50,050 --> 04:08:50,870
Okay, that's strong.

5625
04:08:52,210 --> 04:08:52,530
Alright.

5626
04:08:55,350 --> 04:08:56,730
Let's reload again.

5627
04:09:02,020 --> 04:09:03,790
She's back and less prejudice!

5628
04:09:07,170 --> 04:09:08,270
She's learned!

5629
04:09:19,370 --> 04:09:19,800
That's me!

5630
04:09:23,580 --> 04:09:25,020
Oh, are you hurt?

5631
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:28,520
No, I'm fine.

5632
04:09:29,680 --> 04:09:30,260
But...

5633
04:09:30,260 --> 04:09:31,940
My necklace...

5634
04:09:31,940 --> 04:09:32,840
Was stolen.

5635
04:09:34,480 --> 04:09:35,600
It's an heirloom.

5636
04:09:35,900 --> 04:09:38,360
Passed down in the royal family for generations.

5637
04:09:38,860 --> 04:09:39,760
That's me like a...

5638
04:09:39,760 --> 04:09:41,820
I bet you it's a key to the flying fortress.

5639
04:09:42,980 --> 04:09:45,620
All that matters is that you're safe.

5640
04:09:45,900 --> 04:09:46,780
It looks like a key.

5641
04:09:47,280 --> 04:09:48,120
Come now.

5642
04:09:48,480 --> 04:09:50,260
It is time to go home.

5643
04:09:51,320 --> 04:09:51,900
Yeah.

5644
04:09:55,810 --> 04:09:56,070
Weird.

5645
04:09:56,630 --> 04:09:59,490
I get the feeling we're forgetting about someone.

5646
04:09:59,910 --> 04:10:00,450
Where are you forgetting?

5647
04:10:01,110 --> 04:10:01,670
Nah.

5648
04:10:06,430 --> 04:10:07,190
Yay!

5649
04:10:07,870 --> 04:10:08,630
Alright.

5650
04:10:08,830 --> 04:10:10,030
Time to fast travel.

5651
04:10:10,570 --> 04:10:11,670
Thank God.

5652
04:10:12,970 --> 04:10:14,290
No way!

5653
04:10:14,430 --> 04:10:16,010
We're forgetting people?

5654
04:10:16,630 --> 04:10:17,390
Anne!

5655
04:10:19,590 --> 04:10:21,230
I'm home, everyone.

5656
04:10:22,890 --> 04:10:24,810
Oh, welcome back.

5657
04:10:25,590 --> 04:10:26,610
You hungry?

5658
04:10:26,870 --> 04:10:28,270
I can whip you up something.

5659
04:10:28,270 --> 04:10:28,310
I'm hungry.

5660
04:10:29,350 --> 04:10:31,710
Where are the other ladies in this village?

5661
04:10:35,130 --> 04:10:39,330
Wait a minute.

5662
04:10:39,650 --> 04:10:41,710
Where are all the other women here?

5663
04:10:50,470 --> 04:10:51,630
There you go.

5664
04:10:51,730 --> 04:10:52,230
I wonder why.

5665
04:10:55,250 --> 04:10:57,090
She's the only lady here?

5666
04:10:58,930 --> 04:11:01,630
Yeah, she's the universe's Smurfette.

5667
04:11:11,200 --> 04:11:11,840
God,

5668
04:11:18,780 --> 04:11:19,780
there is Polita!

5669
04:11:20,140 --> 04:11:21,080
There you are!

5670
04:11:21,100 --> 04:11:22,800
Where did you guys come from?

5671
04:11:23,040 --> 04:11:24,260
When there's more!

5672
04:11:26,240 --> 04:11:27,200
Oh thank god!

5673
04:11:27,420 --> 04:11:28,540
Oh thank god!

5674
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:30,640
Where did all these people come from?

5675
04:11:30,640 --> 04:11:33,820
Who the fuck are these guys?

5676
04:11:34,480 --> 04:11:37,600
Oh my god!

5677
04:11:38,260 --> 04:11:41,000
I'm ass and they spawned them in for me!

5678
04:11:41,680 --> 04:11:42,680
Thank god!

5679
04:11:43,680 --> 04:11:48,680
As the princess fan club rep, I offer you my sincerest thanks.

5680
04:11:49,020 --> 04:11:50,660
Oh my god, thank god guys.

5681
04:11:51,540 --> 04:11:52,180
Finally!

5682
04:11:53,340 --> 04:11:56,140
I mean it's not as balanced but still...

5683
04:11:58,100 --> 04:12:00,120
We're gonna call it here chat.

5684
04:12:00,640 --> 04:12:05,080
We rescued and we still have like 50 more hours.

5685
04:12:05,820 --> 04:12:09,100
Honestly, I don't know how much more we have of this game.

5686
04:12:09,300 --> 04:12:11,340
Pretty sure plenty more.

5687
04:12:11,660 --> 04:12:14,120
We're gonna call it here because we have another stream tonight.

5688
04:12:14,540 --> 04:12:17,860
Alright, let me swap off real quick.

5689
04:12:18,780 --> 04:12:20,500
Where's my chatting?

5690
04:12:20,760 --> 04:12:23,500
Oh my god!

5691
04:12:23,640 --> 04:12:25,720
We still have another stream.

5692
04:12:26,340 --> 04:12:29,260
Another stream today so we're gonna call it here.

5693
04:12:29,260 --> 04:12:32,000
I don't wanna overdo it before...

5694
04:12:33,100 --> 04:12:35,400
Overdo it before today's stream.

5695
04:12:35,600 --> 04:12:36,180
But that was fun!

5696
04:12:36,560 --> 04:12:38,260
I'm glad we made some progress.

5697
04:12:39,240 --> 04:12:41,020
We made some progress today.

5698
04:12:41,840 --> 04:12:42,480
And...

5699
04:12:44,960 --> 04:12:48,820
And we advanced the plot and we finally made it to forest land guys.

5700
04:12:49,220 --> 04:12:51,940
We finally... It took us so long.

5701
04:12:52,300 --> 04:12:54,260
But we did it everybody!

5702
04:12:55,060 --> 04:12:56,160
Forest land!

5703
04:12:57,560 --> 04:12:59,120
I told you!

5704
04:12:59,280 --> 04:13:02,160
It was not clickbait!

5705
04:13:05,180 --> 04:13:07,760
We finally made it!

5706
04:13:08,220 --> 04:13:13,280
Honestly... Okay, I'm gonna check how much more we have of sand land.

5707
04:13:13,360 --> 04:13:14,100
I'm actually curious.

5708
04:13:14,560 --> 04:13:16,100
Cause like I know like...

5709
04:13:16,820 --> 04:13:19,960
I know like tomorrow... Not tomorrow, sorry.

5710
04:13:20,040 --> 04:13:20,800
Next week...

5711
04:13:20,800 --> 04:13:22,980
We won't be able to...

5712
04:13:22,980 --> 04:13:25,000
We won't be able to...

5713
04:13:25,000 --> 04:13:26,320
What's the word?

5714
04:13:27,580 --> 04:13:28,640
Have a...

5715
04:13:28,640 --> 04:13:33,040
Have two days of sand land for next week.

5716
04:13:33,080 --> 04:13:35,300
Cause like our schedule is lowkey sort of booked.

5717
04:13:37,980 --> 04:13:39,800
I mean I can check around.

5718
04:13:39,960 --> 04:13:42,860
I'm gonna check my schedule for next week for the goodnight dragoons.

5719
04:13:43,720 --> 04:13:46,640
Cause like it's gonna take a while to finish this.

5720
04:13:47,580 --> 04:13:48,840
Alright, sand land!

5721
04:13:49,180 --> 04:13:49,880
Full game!

5722
04:13:51,480 --> 04:13:52,040
Alright.

5723
04:13:52,540 --> 04:13:54,320
Sand land full game!

5724
04:13:54,320 --> 04:13:55,300
Let's see.

5725
04:13:55,360 --> 04:13:58,580
Let's see where I'm at from this guy's playthrough.

5726
04:13:58,940 --> 04:13:59,360
Alright.

5727
04:14:00,480 --> 04:14:01,680
This guy!

5728
04:14:02,180 --> 04:14:03,100
Oh shit!

5729
04:14:03,300 --> 04:14:03,820
Guys!

5730
04:14:04,260 --> 04:14:04,780
Wait!

5731
04:14:05,140 --> 04:14:05,800
Okay.

5732
04:14:06,540 --> 04:14:08,280
We're at the...

5733
04:14:08,280 --> 04:14:12,500
We're at... We're technically at the 10 hour mark.

5734
04:14:12,820 --> 04:14:13,600
Guys.

5735
04:14:13,820 --> 04:14:17,120
We're like at the 10 hour mark.

5736
04:14:17,440 --> 04:14:20,660
And this guy took 17 hours to finish this.

5737
04:14:20,860 --> 04:14:21,500
So...

5738
04:14:22,560 --> 04:14:23,340
Technically...

5739
04:14:23,340 --> 04:14:24,480
This for them...

5740
04:14:24,480 --> 04:14:26,260
It took them 7 hours?

5741
04:14:26,620 --> 04:14:27,840
For me...

5742
04:14:27,840 --> 04:14:29,560
Maybe like 15...

5743
04:14:35,160 --> 04:14:35,600
Okay.

5744
04:14:35,600 --> 04:14:37,240
For us...

5745
04:14:37,240 --> 04:14:39,800
I won't be surprised if it's longer.

5746
04:14:42,420 --> 04:14:43,300
Because...

5747
04:14:43,300 --> 04:14:45,440
I'm just gonna let you guys know...

5748
04:14:45,440 --> 04:14:46,420
Um...

5749
04:14:46,420 --> 04:14:47,740
For them...

5750
04:14:47,740 --> 04:14:48,720
This...

5751
04:14:48,720 --> 04:14:50,460
To get to where I was...

5752
04:14:51,740 --> 04:14:52,360
To...

5753
04:14:52,360 --> 04:14:52,760
Like...

5754
04:14:52,760 --> 04:14:53,920
To get to like my...

5755
04:14:53,920 --> 04:14:57,520
When I started this playthrough versus to where I was at...

5756
04:14:57,520 --> 04:14:59,760
That took us 4 hours.

5757
04:15:00,200 --> 04:15:01,460
For the playthrough!

5758
04:15:02,030 --> 04:15:03,480
It took them like...

5759
04:15:03,480 --> 04:15:04,700
2 hours.

5760
04:15:04,860 --> 04:15:05,600
So like...

5761
04:15:05,600 --> 04:15:08,200
You can tell we're like 2 hours behind.

5762
04:15:08,960 --> 04:15:09,740
We're...

5763
04:15:10,130 --> 04:15:10,520
We're...

5764
04:15:10,520 --> 04:15:14,280
We're a little bit behind, chat.

5765
04:15:15,170 --> 04:15:15,560
Just...

5766
04:15:15,560 --> 04:15:17,720
Just a little bit, right?

5767
04:15:17,980 --> 04:15:20,680
It's just a little bit behind.

5768
04:15:20,820 --> 04:15:21,600
We still...

5769
04:15:21,600 --> 04:15:23,540
We still got it, guys!

5770
04:15:23,940 --> 04:15:24,620
It's not that...

5771
04:15:24,620 --> 04:15:26,940
It's not that bad!

5772
04:15:28,140 --> 04:15:29,140
Like it's...

5773
04:15:29,140 --> 04:15:30,220
It's still doable.

5774
04:15:34,100 --> 04:15:35,460
But yeah, I still...

5775
04:15:35,460 --> 04:15:37,460
I still enjoy Statenland quite a lot.

5776
04:15:37,560 --> 04:15:41,440
Like I said, I really do like the story of Statenland.

5777
04:15:41,540 --> 04:15:42,480
So I don't really mind.

5778
04:15:42,580 --> 04:15:42,940
Like I'm...

5779
04:15:42,940 --> 04:15:45,400
You know, you don't normally see me play JRPGs.

5780
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:47,440
So it's a nice change of pace.

5781
04:15:47,640 --> 04:15:48,400
You know, just...

5782
04:15:48,400 --> 04:15:50,780
Having a JRPG...

5783
04:15:51,600 --> 04:15:53,400
Like to go back to go to.

5784
04:15:53,740 --> 04:15:54,100
Ah!

5785
04:15:55,020 --> 04:15:56,140
Marshal, thank you for the super chat.

5786
04:15:56,200 --> 04:15:56,440
Thank you.

5787
04:15:56,480 --> 04:15:56,960
Thank you.

5788
04:15:57,240 --> 04:15:58,220
Forrest Land has women.

5789
04:15:58,340 --> 04:15:58,660
Alright.

5790
04:15:58,860 --> 04:15:59,540
I'm so...

5791
04:15:59,540 --> 04:16:00,560
Thank you for the super chat.

5792
04:16:00,640 --> 04:16:00,880
Thank you.

5793
04:16:00,920 --> 04:16:01,320
Thank you.

5794
04:16:01,420 --> 04:16:01,780
Cosmic.

5795
04:16:01,900 --> 04:16:02,780
Can't wait for the return.

5796
04:16:02,880 --> 04:16:03,440
Goodnight, dragons.

5797
04:16:03,620 --> 04:16:04,300
Thank you for the super chat.

5798
04:16:04,340 --> 04:16:04,540
Thank you.

5799
04:16:04,600 --> 04:16:04,980
Thank you.

5800
04:16:04,980 --> 04:16:05,120
Yes!

5801
04:16:05,280 --> 04:16:06,800
We have goodnight, dragons, tonight.

5802
04:16:07,600 --> 04:16:09,480
So there's more yapping for everybody.

5803
04:16:10,280 --> 04:16:11,600
But I'm gonna call it here, everyone.

5804
04:16:11,700 --> 04:16:13,940
Because like I said, we do have another stream today.

5805
04:16:14,440 --> 04:16:15,720
And I don't wanna waste...

5806
04:16:15,720 --> 04:16:16,380
Not waste.

5807
04:16:16,460 --> 04:16:16,860
What's the word?

5808
04:16:16,940 --> 04:16:18,800
I don't wanna use up all my energy for tonight.

5809
04:16:18,980 --> 04:16:20,280
So I'll see you guys there.

5810
04:16:20,400 --> 04:16:20,760
Bye!

5811
04:16:20,760 --> 04:16:23,480
I hope you guys enjoyed today's playthrough of Sand Land.

5812
04:16:23,660 --> 04:16:27,820
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5813
04:16:27,920 --> 04:16:29,920
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

5814
04:16:30,020 --> 04:16:31,260
Cos you deserve it.

5815
04:16:31,360 --> 04:16:32,400
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5816
04:16:33,100 --> 04:16:33,720
Bye, guys.

5817
04:16:34,240 --> 04:16:34,600
Bye!
