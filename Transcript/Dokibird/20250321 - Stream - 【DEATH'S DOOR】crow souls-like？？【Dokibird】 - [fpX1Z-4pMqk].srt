1
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,590
Of course, hello everybody.

2
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,970
It is I, Crowkey, back at it again.

3
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,630
I am out of my cage for another Crow-themed game.

4
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,230
Sorry, sorry, I meant.

5
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,370
Oh my god, Crowkey, you just... sorry, Doki.

6
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,410
I got too immersed.

7
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,670
Doki, you just... you're recovering your voice.

8
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,350
Why are you fucking it up again?

9
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,530
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,430
I got too into the character, guys.

11
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,450
Whenever I'm Crowkey, I just... all I wanna do is...

12
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,910
That's all I wanna do.

13
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,070
You don't understand.

14
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,450
I can't help it.

15
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,730
Alright, before I play... what's it called?

16
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,350
Death's Door?

17
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,750
I thought it was a roguelite cause it looked... I've been trying to find some roguelites to play.

18
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,930
So like, it was either... I was gonna play this one or the other one which was like... what was it called?

19
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,490
It was something related to death.

20
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,550
There's an actual roguelite that's called Death's... what's it?

21
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,670
Oh my god, I can't remember.

22
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,510
It's the one...

23
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,870
cause I thought this one was the one that's about death that's like an actual roguelite.

24
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,510
And like, it was either that game or Death's Door.

25
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,210
But then I was like, I wanna... oh, is it Have a Nice Death?

26
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,170
Oh, I think it is.

27
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,850
Yeah, there's so many death-related games.

28
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,310
There's one where you try to do tax returns as death.

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:04:00,190
By the way, speaking of tax returns, I was registering at the Canada Revenue Agency today for like, tax reasons.

30
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,790
And I had to register a new account.

31
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,030
So I was doing that.

32
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,970
That was a fucking headache by the way.

33
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,290
That... I spent like a couple of hours trying to figure that shit out.

34
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,410
And... that sounds so exciting.

35
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,890
Oh my god, I love... I love being an adult.

36
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,330
Wow!

37
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,070
That is why today... today I... yeah, I finished it.

38
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,570
I fixed some problems and that required me to make a new tax account at the Canada Revenue Agency.

39
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,870
And it's okay now.

40
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,030
Everything is okay.

41
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,110
I had my staff members guide me on the step-by-step process because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

42
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,770
So today, I don't feel...

43
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,390
I don't want to be a person anymore.

44
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,950
That's why I'm croaky.

45
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,310
Crows don't have to deal with taxes.

46
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,210
Crows don't have to worry about paying... getting tax returns.

47
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,410
Crows don't have to worry about social security numbers.

48
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,670
Oh my god, thank god.

49
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,910
Crows can live a free life.

50
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,670
I'm about to tax my crows.

51
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,610
Anyway, so crows can just steal...

52
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,250
Exactly, exactly.

53
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,670
Why pay taxes when I can steal gold?

54
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,830
That's the life, being a crow.

55
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,570
Anyway, before we play the game, I'm going to show real quick.

56
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:42,950
If you guys didn't know, there is an official croaky plush that is out now.

57
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,970
Right now.

58
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,650
Wow, you can buy me right now.

59
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,590
So you can own your very own croaky plushie.

60
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:02,410
If you order at youtubes.com slash collection slash jokeybird and you can grab your own croaky plushie.

61
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,430
That's right, me.

62
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,810
That's me, guys.

63
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,590
Wow.

64
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,350
Alright, chill complete.

65
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,350
I bought it already.

66
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,770
Yeah, but did you buy just one?

67
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,330
Why buy one when you can have two?

68
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,350
Why buy two when you can have three?

69
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,730
Why buy three when you can have four?

70
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,350
The possibilities are endless.

71
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,270
Exactly.

72
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,650
The croaky has spoken.

73
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,050
I don't remember what all my expressions were.

74
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,610
Oh, there's me putting my hands down because I'm tired.

75
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,650
I'm so tired.

76
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,550
I have one where I'm just tired.

77
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:11,590
Let me rotate myself down a little.

78
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,510
I don't want to look a little too freaky.

79
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,770
Alright, so this is apparently a soulslike.

80
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:30,810
I didn't realize it was a soulslike until I guess I read the game description and then I was like, wait a minute.

81
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,130
Wait a minute.

82
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,770
This is not a roguelike.

83
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,150
It looked like a soulslike.

84
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,590
It looked like Hades and I was like, oh, have a nice death as a roguelike.

85
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,710
I was like, oh man, I really want to play a roguelike today.

86
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,710
That's what I want to do today.

87
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,270
And then so, so, so I thought that was a roguelike.

88
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,410
And then like today I checked it before I made my waiting room today.

89
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,550
I checked it and it says soulslike.

90
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,580
I was like, no, no.

91
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,540
Wait, what do you mean?

92
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,200
Um, so yeah, I guess, I guess that's what we're playing today.

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,260
I guess that's okay.

94
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm trying to rotate myself.

95
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,320
I'm going to be on this side.

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
Ooh, maybe I want to look like it.

97
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,780
Ooh, hey guys.

98
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,450
Give me a sec.

99
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,270
Whoa, I'm trying to roll.

100
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,910
I'm practicing my rolls for, for the game.

101
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,190
Ooh, there's me front facing croaky will never hurt you.

102
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,230
All right, let's see.

103
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,330
I guess I'll face this direction.

104
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,330
I guess that's the best one, right?

105
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,430
Is it?

106
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,450
I can't tell.

107
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,250
Okay, here you go.

108
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,510
Yeah, I'll be here.

109
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,710
All right, there you go.

110
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,550
No, actually, no, maybe I like myself being here.

111
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,430
What if I just don't look at you guys?

112
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,710
What if I just stop looking at you guys?

113
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,270
Let me adjust myself, guys.

114
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,310
Being croaky is hard work.

115
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,850
It ain't much, but it's hard.

116
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,230
It's hard work.

117
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,230
It's honest work, guys.

118
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,110
All right, now I'm here.

119
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,570
Okay, let me move myself here.

120
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,490
All right, there you go.

121
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,590
Wow, okay, there you go.

122
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,950
There you go.

123
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,690
Much better.

124
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,610
That much better?

125
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,170
Yeah, much better.

126
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,930
Ooh, maybe I'll... Okay, there you go.

127
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,650
Much better.

128
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,330
Yeah!

129
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,110
But nothing changed.

130
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,510
You're just facing... You just wrote... You just flipped yourself.

131
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,350
It looks much better, guys.

132
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,250
You don't understand.

133
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,250
It looks much better.

134
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,750
You don't understand.

135
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,590
You don't get it, okay?

136
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,210
You just don't get it.

137
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:32,710
You just... You just don't understand, chat.

138
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,510
You just don't understand.

139
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,430
Okay, I don't know what my default... Should the default be here?

140
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,790
Yeah, my default should be here.

141
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,690
Is my default here best?

142
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,390
I don't know.

143
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,470
I don't know if I should like... Do I face here for my default, guys?

144
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,390
Hmm, I guess I... You know what?

145
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,570
Yeah, that's fine.

146
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,410
I'll rotate a little bit.

147
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:55,830
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,370
I'm being a little picky right now with how I'm... Okay, there we go.

149
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,330
There you go.

150
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,650
That should be fine.

151
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm trying to get my... I'm trying to get my good angles, guys.

152
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,950
I gotta look good, chat.

153
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,450
Alright?

154
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,950
It's been a while.

155
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,750
Krooky's gotta look good.

156
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,110
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

157
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,490
Thank you.

158
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,250
Thank you.

159
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,610
Kami Kuroshi, I can text.

160
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,590
Thank you for the super chat.

161
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:23,970
Thank you.

162
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,570
Thank you.

163
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:31,510
Every super chat gets a... Void Time, thank you for the super chat.

164
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:31,870
Thank you.

165
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,570
Thank you.

166
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,910
Sorry, I'm trying not to make it too... I'm trying not to illustrate it.

167
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,470
Try Stone Start or Eden for some roguelites.

168
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,230
Thank you for the super chat.

169
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:41,570
Thank you.

170
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,270
Thank you.

171
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,330
Yosh, thank you for the super chat.

172
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:44,670
Thank you.

173
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,410
Thank you.

174
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,550
Thank you.

175
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,250
Not a roguelite?

176
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,810
Congratulations, you're playing yourself.

177
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,170
Thank you for the super chat.

178
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,550
Thank you.

179
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,170
Thank you.

180
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,490
Alright, let's boot up.

181
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,930
Let's boot up the game.

182
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,530
Alright.

183
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,530
Guys, is this my good angle?

184
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,030
Guys, is this my good angle, guys?

185
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,010
Do you think I look great, guys?

186
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,330
Do you think I look good?

187
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,980
Is this my good side, guys?

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,080
I need to know.

189
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,560
I need to know.

190
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,160
Is this my good side?

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,020
Best angle?

192
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Is it?

193
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,120
Okay, alright, I believe you guys.

194
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,360
As long as you think I look good, that's all I care about.

195
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,860
Let me rotate here.

196
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,080
Alright, there we go.

197
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, yeah.

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,300
Yeah.

199
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,700
Yeah.

200
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
Alright, I look great now.

201
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,760
Yeah.

202
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,260
Okay.

203
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,600
Alright, I'm ready.

204
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,640
Sorry, I gotta make sure I look great.

205
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,440
I look handsome.

206
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,160
I need to look like a handsome crow.

207
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,120
Five big caws from me.

208
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,620
Thank you, Mehdi, for the super chat.

209
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,020
Thank you.

210
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,100
Thank you.

211
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,940
Caw.

212
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,740
Caw.

213
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,300
Caw.

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,240
Audio, thank you for the super chat.

215
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,640
Thank you.

216
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,300
Thank you.

217
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,080
Caw.

218
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,860
Caw.

219
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,260
Alright.

220
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Okay, I think that's my... I think I look good now.

221
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay, I have to make sure that we got all the right angles.

222
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,760
Alright.

223
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,660
Guys, okay, I'm gonna use mouse and keyboard.

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,920
I know it says maybe I'll be better in controller, but if this is a souls-like... Wait, actually, I don't know.

225
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,240
I feel like I react better on M and K because I played Hate.

226
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,680
I feel like I do, but I'm not sure.

227
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm not sure, guys.

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,140
I'm using wings, so I'm not sure.

229
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:44,420
I don't know if I should use... I'm not sure if I should use... Oh my gosh.

230
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,280
Okay, let me know if... Okay, keyboard and mouse.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,620
V, left attack, middle mouse button, chart.

232
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,860
Okay, let's get a controller.

233
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh wait, you guys can't see the game.

234
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,340
I realized I forgot the one thing.

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,640
I have to show my video game first.

237
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,480
Alright.

238
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,320
Sorry, croquis new at this.

239
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,200
Sorry, guys.

240
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,380
Croquis is new.

241
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,100
Instinct and try controller first.

242
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,240
I feel like... I don't know.

243
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,840
I can't tell.

244
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,900
I can't tell if it's better with controller or M and K.

245
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,240
But like, we'll try controller first.

246
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,760
Maybe the world will be nice to me today.

247
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,700
Maybe it'll be nice to me.

248
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,420
I don't know.

249
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,220
Alright.

250
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Do I have to reset?

251
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,520
Okay.

252
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,740
Oh, do I have to... Okay.

253
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,460
Okay, nice.

254
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:14,740
Okay.

255
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,280
I have no idea.

256
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,300
Alright, there we go.

257
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, she turned into a roller player.

258
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,540
Thank you for the super chat, Johnny.

259
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:22,940
Thank you.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,700
Thank you.

261
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
Alright, let's start.

262
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,480
There's me.

263
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,140
That's me right there.

264
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,880
Do you see me?

265
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm down there.

266
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,400
Right there.

267
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,420
Right there.

268
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,400
Sorry, I don't... My hands don't work today.

269
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,880
I'm tired.

270
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,720
Alright.

271
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,540
Now arriving at Reaping Commission Headquarters.

272
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,120
End of the line!

273
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,440
Oh, there's me.

274
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,680
Okay.

275
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,100
Oh, I have a sword.

276
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,500
Oh my god.

277
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,320
Oh, and I can roll.

278
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,620
See, that's what I was doing earlier.

279
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,200
I was rolling.

280
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,060
Guys, nothing else.

281
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Ain't got no souls.

282
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Ain't got no shinies.

283
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,100
Ain't got no worries.

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,860
That's me!

285
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,040
I told you!

286
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,520
When you're a crow, you don't have to pay taxes.

287
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,300
No worries.

288
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,880
No money.

289
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,140
No worries, guys.

290
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,660
Just like that.

291
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,000
He knows what's up.

292
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,220
That's me right there on the streets.

293
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,660
On the fucking streets.

294
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,920
Yeah, you're clear.

295
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,160
Moving along, bud.

296
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,680
Yay!

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,300
Wait.

298
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,400
Wait, but where's my sword?

299
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,340
Oh, he doesn't give a fuck.

300
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,760
Alright.

301
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,180
Okay.

302
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,120
Hall of Doors.

303
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,780
Hello.

304
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Better get moving.

305
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,040
Don't wanna be late, right?

306
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,820
Where do I go?

307
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,960
There's two ways.

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
Where do I jump?

309
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,540
Okay, I can't go that way.

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,560
Okay.

311
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,860
Also, let me know if the sound's okay, sound guy.

312
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,040
Ooh, the music's nice already, though.

313
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,920
Well, well, well.

314
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,740
Oh, Shandler.

315
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,520
Look who showed up for work.

316
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,920
No worms for you.

317
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,820
Because only the early bird catches... never mind.

318
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,940
Anyway, it's your lucky day.

319
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,240
I actually have a soul for you to reap.

320
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
And not just any soul.

321
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,160
A giant soul.

322
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,400
Think of the commission on that.

323
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,700
I hope you haven't forgotten your training.

324
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,480
Stay on your talons.

325
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,240
Giant souls don't often go peacefully.

326
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,280
Dropping in your door for you now.

327
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,600
Wait, they're putting me in?

328
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,720
Into the action?

329
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,980
Whoa!

330
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,020
That's a door.

331
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,820
With a soul that size, you might be able to afford some time off.

332
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,480
But remember...

333
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,840
Oh my god, it's like Fire Bay.

334
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,740
Your door will remain open until you return with your designated soul.

335
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,020
While your door is open, you will be mortal and you will age.

336
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,540
So get it done quickly.

337
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,700
Reaping souls to power the doors just so you can reap more souls.

338
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,180
And the cycle repeats forever and ever.

339
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,720
You're here forever, little guy.

340
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,340
The rat race, eh?

341
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,920
Anyway, get to it and be careful.

342
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,960
I love capitalism.

343
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,920
Wait, I thought...

344
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,060
Being a crow means I get to escape that!

345
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,420
Wait a minute!

346
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440
Wait!

347
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,920
Wait a...

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,820
No!

349
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,340
I can't ever leave capitalism!

350
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,260
Crowplism...

351
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,640
No!

352
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,180
Not even crows can escape the grind.

353
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh boy, I love typing.

354
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,880
Can't get enough of it.

355
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,500
I thought I could leave the grind.

356
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,880
No!

357
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,680
Alright, let's see.

358
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,760
Oh, where's the door?

359
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,140
It's like right here, right?

360
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh yeah, it is.

361
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,000
There's death's door.

362
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,040
Sad co... co...

363
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,160
Guess it's time to be a mortal.

364
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,020
Whoa, colors!

365
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
The great grove of spirits.

366
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,580
Okay.

367
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,280
Alright, here's me.

368
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,860
That's me rolling.

369
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,720
Whoa!

370
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,620
Oh look, there's a little guy.

371
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,680
Hello, little guy.

372
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,320
Oh.

373
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,920
You're so scared, little guy.

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,380
Why are you following me?

375
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,340
Okay, I can open... Oh, I can open these doors.

376
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay.

377
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,780
See, little guy.

378
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,380
Try to kill little guy.

379
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,480
Nothing personal, kid.

380
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
That's fucking right, get out of here.

381
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
Oh, wait, I have a bow?

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,420
Oh!

383
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,740
Oh!

384
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,320
Oh, that's cute!

385
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,020
Oh, I have a bow.

386
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,980
It's like a gun.

387
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,100
Wait, I used up all my ammo.

388
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,520
Wait, no!

389
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,070
I didn't know I'm living around...

390
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,310
No!

391
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,770
Demonic force... I didn't know!

392
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,170
Oh, I do not like the flashy though.

393
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,710
Oh, I wonder if there's a way to turn...

394
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,530
Okay, I need to know if there's a way to turn that off.

395
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,370
Oh, I don't like that.

396
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,770
I don't like how flashy that is.

397
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,110
Okay.

398
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,730
Oh, Emily flash is nice.

399
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,110
Okay.

400
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,010
Nice.

401
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,870
That's good.

402
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,490
That flashing isn't... Yeah, that... Okay, I'm gonna turn it minimums too.

403
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,690
We do not care about that.

404
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,270
There we go.

405
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,650
Oh my god, that's a lot better.

406
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,730
That's actually... That... Oh shit!

407
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,070
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,930
Alright.

409
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,230
Wait, I have... I can bow.

410
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,070
There we go.

411
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:28,950
Nice.

412
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,190
Yeah, I was gonna be like, you don't like that.

413
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,870
I also don't like screen shakes too, so...

414
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,010
I wonder if this works.

415
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:37,810
Oh, it does.

416
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,310
What?

417
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,410
What's he gonna do?

418
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,210
Slam on me?

419
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,770
Oh shit, no, he's not doing that.

420
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,030
Wait.

421
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,650
Can I break your leg?

422
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,710
Go down.

423
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,690
Leg go down.

424
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,490
There we go.

425
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,090
That's right.

426
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,030
Get down from there.

427
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,830
First boss completed.

428
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,390
Never challenge Croaky!

429
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,510
I've seen things.

430
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,310
Whoa.

431
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,130
What?

432
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,770
Oh, maybe... Okay, maybe he can challenge Croaky.

433
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,310
Hello, little guys.

434
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,570
Are these the dragoons?

435
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,670
Get out of here.

436
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,010
Let's go home.

437
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,450
Boo!

438
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,430
Turkey, please.

439
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,830
Why would she do this?

440
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,530
Guys, personal space, guys.

441
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:52,870
What?

442
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,630
Croaky the man 6 feet.

443
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,710
Guys.

444
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,190
Personal space.

445
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,970
Where am I?

446
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,950
What the fuck?

447
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,730
Is this a dungeon?

448
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,110
Oh, hey, look.

449
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,430
What'd I get?

450
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,590
I got lightspeed.

451
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,470
Oh, which can consume the rooster.

452
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,190
Oh, I get to have my HP back.

453
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,650
Don't you?

454
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,650
No space between us.

455
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,710
Guys, 6 feet, guys.

456
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,850
Have you forgotten about your protocols?

457
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,550
Alright, let's see.

458
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,650
I guess we go this way.

459
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:32,810
Oh.

460
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,410
I actually turn it up?

461
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,230
Okay, there we go.

462
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,550
Oops, there we go.

463
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,490
That should be better now.

464
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,630
Alright.

465
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,610
Oh, hey there, guy.

466
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,970
He seems like a bad man.

467
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,590
Just cause he's...

468
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,510
Just cause he has no head.

469
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,850
No head equals bad.

470
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,050
So, that was years.

471
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,130
That was like 4 years ago.

472
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,370
Guys, I'm a little worried that you forgot that COVID was actually 4 years ago.

473
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,830
That was not a long time ago, chat.

474
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,970
That was...

475
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,250
Yeah.

476
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,910
That worries me a little bit.

477
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,710
Oh yeah, sorry.

478
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,850
5 years ago.

479
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,910
Can I activate this?

480
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,370
Oh shit, nice.

481
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,710
I wanna go this way.

482
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,090
Oh, there's another thing here.

483
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,190
It's retro hours.

484
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,270
Alright, I guess I go back?

485
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,910
I go home now?

486
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,770
Hello, I'm home.

487
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,530
A little crow.

488
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,370
That's me!

489
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,530
Do I sense a lot of solar energy?

490
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,970
Come here, and you can trade in those souls to gain an edge in combat.

491
00:24:59,450 --> 00:24:59,730
Okay.

492
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,930
Yippee!

493
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,430
I did my job.

494
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,470
I'm...

495
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,450
Clocking in and clocking out.

496
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,130
I love crowpolism.

497
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,850
Welcome to the soul vault.

498
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,830
Would you like to increase your combat abilities?

499
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,010
Okay, build attack with speed and precision.

500
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,330
Okay, guys.

501
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,090
I wanna know who are the 5 people that played this game.

502
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,470
There's a nice way to ask for that croquis.

503
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,290
Thank you for the super chat, Lord Crow.

504
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,650
Thank you, thank you.

505
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,410
Alright.

506
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,170
Do I put it all in strength?

507
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,950
Who are the 5 other crows that played this?

508
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,450
Show yourself.

509
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,970
Do we just be...

510
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,590
Do we just put it all in strength?

511
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,670
Oh, we can't.

512
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,130
We're broke.

513
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:48,850
Nevermind.

514
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,310
Guys, nevermind.

515
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,530
We're broke.

516
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,030
We can't spend money yet.

517
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,950
Hello, did I do it?

518
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,950
Is that a good oh no or a bad oh no?

519
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,910
You've lost your son, so I killed him!

520
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,210
Check the VOD!

521
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,010
Check the VOD!

522
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,710
That's the one thing we didn't want to happen.

523
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,450
Well, get back out there.

524
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,170
Don't come back until you find...

525
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,490
What?

526
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,310
But I killed him!

527
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,430
Check my VODs!

528
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,370
Check my camera!

529
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,830
Check the camera they installed on all birds!

530
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,550
The government installed it on all of us!

531
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,970
Check that camera!

532
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,630
Okay.

533
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,490
Where do I go?

534
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,570
Do I go to the cemetery or the grove?

535
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,230
Okay, where is my camera?

536
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,790
Where do I go?

537
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,010
Guess I go up?

538
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,650
Instructions unclear.

539
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,190
Oh, it is like a souls-like.

540
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,730
We're like, I don't know where to go.

541
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,930
That sounds right.

542
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,370
Just like all my souls-like adventures.

543
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,770
Where the fuck do I go?

544
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,590
What?

545
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,730
Oh, there's no fall damage.

546
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,290
Thank God.

547
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,070
Don't be broke.

548
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,410
Mom, thank you for the magenta super!

549
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,070
Thank you, thank you!

550
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,270
Alright.

551
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,830
Let's see.

552
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,730
I'll kill him then.

553
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:16,990
Get out of here.

554
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,070
Only I can fly here.

555
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,830
I'm a crow, but yeah, I can fly.

556
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,230
My hands are too busy holding this cool-ass sword, I guess.

557
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,270
Whoa.

558
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:27,750
Whoa!

559
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,530
Whoa!

560
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,530
No hands!

561
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,130
Stop!

562
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,070
No grabbing!

563
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,790
Stranger danger!

564
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,450
Alright.

565
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,550
Nice.

566
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,750
Personal space, bro.

567
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,210
That's what you want.

568
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,890
What the fuck?

569
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,610
Okay.

570
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,410
Alright, nice.

571
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,330
We got him out.

572
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,290
Get out of here.

573
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,210
Woo!

574
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,790
Arrows does jack shit to them, though.

575
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,970
These guys can not- These guys are like one hit.

576
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,730
Okay.

577
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:57,910
Okay.

578
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,310
And then I'll pick up the key.

579
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,290
Whoa!

580
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,530
Oh, does it- Oh, no.

581
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,870
It's just like- It just means I picked it up.

582
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,950
I don't need heals.

583
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,710
I'm invincible.

584
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,950
Title card.

585
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,310
And where else do I go?

586
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,650
Where else is there a key?

587
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,930
This way to the summit.

588
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:19,510
Okay.

589
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,290
Oh, there's a key.

590
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,750
Alright.

591
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,290
Oh, yeah!

592
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,050
What is this like?

593
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,270
This is like- So, it's because they respawn when I leave.

594
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,170
Okay.

595
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,690
And when I go home, I get my HP back.

596
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,150
Oh, shit.

597
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:36,910
Whoa!

598
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,650
That's fucking right.

599
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,630
Get out of here.

600
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,750
Wait, there's more?

601
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,690
Oh, fuck!

602
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,350
I'm sorry.

603
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,570
I was not paying attention.

604
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,410
I was like, wait a minute.

605
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,350
Wait, it's not over yet?

606
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,270
Oh, shit!

607
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,090
What the fuck?

608
00:28:59,370 --> 00:28:59,970
Get out.

609
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,730
Okay, these guys are like one-shot, so I don't have to care too much about them.

610
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,810
Okay.

611
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:14,610
Okay, I think like he- I can't hit him when he's like just a face.

612
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,490
Oh, shit.

613
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,150
Whoa!

614
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,690
Okay, let me get closer to this guy.

615
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:21,670
Come on!

616
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,490
Get over here!

617
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,330
That's right.

618
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,570
That's right.

619
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,530
Fucking stupid.

620
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,690
Come on!

621
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,130
Yeah!

622
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,050
What the fuck?

623
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,890
How did I miss that?

624
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,730
There's more?

625
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,650
Oh, shit.

626
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,310
Now there's a face man and him.

627
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,250
Oh, my God.

628
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,930
Stranger Danger Man is here too.

629
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,550
Oh, my God.

630
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,710
Stranger Danger Man.

631
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,250
Stranger Danger Man.

632
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,990
Get out.

633
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,970
There we go.

634
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,750
I can't kill him before.

635
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,690
All right, get over here.

636
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,090
Oh, shit!

637
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,130
Oh, shit!

638
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,170
Oh, shit!

639
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,050
That's right.

640
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,350
Your number one enemy.

641
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,310
Walls.

642
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,210
Yay!

643
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,990
What a dumb guy.

644
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,190
I know, right?

645
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,990
Can't even beat a crow.

646
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,210
I'm like that crow with a knife.

647
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,650
There used to be a crow in Canada that would terrorize people.

648
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,410
And like he found- there was a stabbing or something.

649
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,330
And then like the crow picked up the murder- well, it wasn't an attempted murder weapon.

650
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,150
The crow picked up the- the knife.

651
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,250
The crow picked up the weapon from the scene of the crime and then went around flying around with a knife.

652
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,650
He's the infamous knife crow.

653
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,310
That's my crow sheet right there.

654
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,450
Not just any crow, crow key.

655
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,110
Crow gang.

656
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,950
No, that's my- that's my crow- that's my crow sheet right there.

657
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:51,630
Oh, hey.

658
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,150
Hello?

659
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:55,530
A reaper!

660
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,450
My time in this world is over.

661
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,790
That's right, get over here.

662
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,350
I need a soul right now.

663
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,830
Unfortunately, I'm still alive.

664
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,070
Please, I need to pay off my debts.

665
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,970
Please.

666
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,450
I have a family.

667
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,970
As in, a family of one.

668
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,930
Sorry, maybe try hitting me with a heart attack.

669
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,970
Don't worry, I got you.

670
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,490
Phew.

671
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,330
I only have one attack.

672
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,370
Oh, I have two attacks.

673
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,110
Let's go.

674
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,090
No.

675
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,470
He's still here and still very much alive.

676
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,170
Perhaps try a bit of a run up?

677
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,410
I can run attack?

678
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:37,810
Oh.

679
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,930
I'm sorry, it's not your fault.

680
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,490
It happens to- guys, I'm- it's my first- guys, I swear, this is the first time this happened.

681
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,890
I've killed many other people.

682
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,790
I swear to God.

683
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,090
Guys.

684
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,130
I'm afraid I'm burdened with unending life.

685
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,650
I can't explain it and I spent untold years seeking an answer.

686
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,650
My name is Steadhone.

687
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,950
I'm the keeper of grades on the sacred mountain.

688
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,670
Oh, and if you do find yourself stranded somehow, feel free to try and kill me again.

689
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,070
Okay.

690
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,890
I swear to God, this is like the first time it happened.

691
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,130
I've killed many other people.

692
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,630
I swear to God.

693
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:15,750
I swear to God.

694
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,910
This is only the first time, guys.

695
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,270
I've killed so many others.

696
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,710
And they all- they all died and left me glowing reviews.

697
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,670
What's this?

698
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,870
Here lies the guarding of the door, a preserver of order and a home to stray souls.

699
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,690
They all- yeah, they all died satisfied.

700
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,570
No name.

701
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,970
Thank you for the super chat.

702
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,530
Thank you.

703
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,470
Thank you.

704
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,530
God!

705
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,570
Thank you for it.

706
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,850
It's so small.

707
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:56,650
Alright.

708
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,750
Croaky the Grim Weaker.

709
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,590
Thank you for the super chat.

710
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,090
Simple.

711
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,630
Thank you.

712
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,210
Thank you.

713
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:02,650
God!

714
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,490
This only- this happened once, okay?

715
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,850
It's the first time it's ever happened, guys.

716
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,150
You saw me kill.

717
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,710
You guys saw it.

718
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,810
Yeah!

719
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,410
Climb up.

720
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,610
Sure, we did.

721
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:25,850
We definitely- are the dead people that you definitely killed here in the room with us right now.

722
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,450
No, they're not because they're fucking dead.

723
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,350
Because I do a good job.

724
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,290
Okay.

725
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,270
I don't know when I'll ever use this attack.

726
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,510
I feel like- you know what I love about this game?

727
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,590
There's no parry button.

728
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,690
Thank God.

729
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,570
For now.

730
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,210
From what I've seen yet now, there is no hidden secret lies within.

731
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,430
What?

732
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,390
What's the secret?

733
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,450
Oh, it has a twin.

734
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,750
So this- For now.

735
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,490
Oh, yeah.

736
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,790
For now, I don't have to worry.

737
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,570
What the fuck do I do?

738
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,130
Okay.

739
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,910
I guess we don't go here.

740
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,330
I'll go this side.

741
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,430
First.

742
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,310
Pew!

743
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,550
Oh, shit.

744
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:22,830
Nice.

745
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,370
One shot.

746
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,230
Okay.

747
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,050
That's good.

748
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,450
At least now I can two-shot.

749
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:31,990
Ah!

750
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,180
I don't know how a dog can fly!

751
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I'm a crow!

752
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,400
Why can't I fucking- This is for a crow family.

753
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,660
I- I thought there'd be an invisible wall!

754
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,530
How the fuck was that supposed to be an invisible wall?

755
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,230
Oh, part two.

756
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,110
Where the fuck- I guess I need to plant a pot.

757
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,330
Where are the pots in this game?

758
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,730
Yes, where the fuck are the pots?

759
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,050
Oh, no.

760
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,210
I don't know where the pots are.

761
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,650
Have I been here?

762
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,030
Why are they dead?

763
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,230
Have I been here?

764
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,790
I don't remember here.

765
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,810
I clearly killed somebody here.

766
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,470
Was that a shortcut?

767
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,470
There's a pot right there.

768
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,990
Oh, I have killed here.

769
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,050
Okay, I'm gonna go- Oh my god, it is a soul slayer.

770
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,830
I have killed.

771
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,790
Guys, all the killings are blurred together.

772
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,150
Croaky has- Has no recollection of all these kills.

773
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,750
Okay.

774
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,270
Yay!

775
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,650
Om nom nom.

776
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,110
Om nom nom nom.

777
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,350
Alright, back at it again.

778
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,210
Oscar, welcome to the tomato farm!

779
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,150
Welcome, welcome!

780
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:06,970
Gah!

781
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,610
Okay.

782
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,070
Let's just roll faster.

783
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,590
Alright, up I go.

784
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,190
Croaky climb.

785
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,570
Croaky keeps climbing.

786
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,530
Guys, I'm not gonna remember where I am very soon.

787
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,610
Okay, what if I wanna take an elevator?

788
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,370
Secret!

789
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,970
I knew it.

790
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,650
What's the secret over here?

791
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,570
What?

792
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,090
Oh no, it's over here.

793
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,010
Secret?

794
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,090
I'm praying?

795
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,730
Does Croaky have a god too?

796
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,050
Woah!

797
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,570
The ancient shrine offers you a shard from a vitality crystal.

798
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,830
Collecting four will raise your vitality beyond- Yay!

799
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,170
Health up.

800
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,830
Okay, I need to find four more.

801
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,570
Okay, so I got more HP then.

802
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,190
Crow god.

803
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,610
I prayed to my crow god and he granted me vitality.

804
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,790
Now I can last for it.

805
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,330
Now I can actually kill.

806
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,170
Okay, so that is not with my charge attack.

807
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,270
That means I have to come back here.

808
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,010
Oh shit.

809
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,990
Does he know where to- Okay, he can roll up then.

810
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,170
Alright, nice.

811
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,450
Is there a secret here?

812
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,120
Wait!

813
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,840
Okay, so I can knock them back with the bow.

814
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,020
Okay, good to know.

815
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,080
Stupid.

816
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,320
That's actually really good to know.

817
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:03,980
Okay.

818
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,720
Alright, get over here.

819
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,780
So fucking stupid.

820
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,140
That's okay, right?

821
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,300
Give me your fucking plan too.

822
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,440
I'm mugging you.

823
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,180
Welcome back to London.

824
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,860
I don't know where to go.

825
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,120
Do I have a map?

826
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,920
No, right?

827
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,020
Cause it's like, so it's like- Okay, thank god.

828
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:39,620
I'm trying to be like, how far is this- Do I survive all fall damage?

829
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,520
Do I know map?

830
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,520
I feel like you can make up some stuff cause I feel like not a lot of people have played or streamed this game.

831
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,320
So you guys can say anything and I would like not even know if it's true or not.

832
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,240
I'd be like, whoops.

833
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,040
I'd be like, I just believe you.

834
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,620
Probably, should we test it?

835
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,840
Alright, let's see.

836
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,780
Oh shit.

837
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,520
Magic.

838
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,980
What you going doing with magic, huh?

839
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,660
Loser.

840
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,060
Fight me like a true man.

841
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,160
Like a true crow.

842
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,540
That's fucking right.

843
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,400
These guys are like babies.

844
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,420
They're so weak.

845
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,260
Oh fuck!

846
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,800
Oh fuck!

847
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,340
Okay, I regret saying that.

848
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,200
Why?

849
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,500
I didn't think he'd do that, okay.

850
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:52,980
Okay.

851
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,800
Oh shit, I think he's gonna use a spell, yeah.

852
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,380
There we go.

853
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,060
I gotta be careful of this guy.

854
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,840
Oh fuck, what?

855
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,770
Holy shit!

856
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,150
They actually fight back, guys!

857
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,450
I was not expecting that!

858
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,490
Okay, thank God.

859
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,510
Plant the seed.

860
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,170
Okay, thank God there's a seed planter.

861
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,550
I was gonna be like, extra fucked if there wasn't.

862
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,490
How dare these children fight back!

863
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,910
Okay, I got two.

864
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,930
Out of that.

865
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,490
Let's get a third in.

866
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,580
Okay.

867
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,420
Oh shit.

868
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,660
That was unintentional.

869
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,660
No, no, no!

870
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,840
What the fuck?!

871
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,100
Oh my God!

872
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
And there's so many!

873
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,180
What the fuck do I do?!

874
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh my God, wait, that's so fucked up!

875
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,780
No, I can't get enough!

876
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,460
One use only?!

877
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,840
Okay, that's messed up.

878
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,580
They actually surrounded me.

879
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,100
That's actually so messed up.

880
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,360
Oh my God, thank God.

881
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,640
That's crazy.

882
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,080
Like, I couldn't, I can't even leave!

883
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,500
They actually...

884
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,180
Okay, now I know...

885
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,260
Don't go in the corner.

886
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,320
If Croaky goes in the corner, it's bye-bye.

887
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,240
Oh my God.

888
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,320
They all like, surrounded me.

889
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,560
That's fucking crazy.

890
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,660
And okay, now I know that the plants are one use.

891
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,880
Oh my God.

892
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,840
I couldn't even get out of it!

893
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,320
Or like, invinci...

894
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,380
Like, dodge it.

895
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,080
Like, invincible frame it.

896
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,590
Or use like, what is it called?

897
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,010
Invulnerability frame?

898
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,570
Or I-frame it?

899
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,690
I couldn't even do that.

900
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,910
They literally like, fucking surrounded me.

901
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,340
Guys, there's no pots.

902
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,720
Oh no.

903
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,200
Oh wait.

904
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,700
Oh wait.

905
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,220
That does not look like a good castle.

906
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,720
Oh.

907
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,100
Oh.

908
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,340
Okay.

909
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,620
Guys.

910
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,160
I don't think this castle...

911
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,320
This does not look like a...

912
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,660
A nice castle.

913
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,020
Guys, I think this castle wants to kill me!

914
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,660
Okay, I deserve at least like...

915
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,240
Like, some fucking form of HP or something.

916
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,060
Like, this is not fair.

917
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,240
Woah!

918
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,800
That's right, get arrowed.

919
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,680
Woah!

920
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,040
Oh shit!

921
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,360
Okay.

922
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,180
Okay, I can't...

923
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,560
I can't charge my attack.

924
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,140
Oh my God.

925
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,580
I actually can't charge my attack.

926
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,040
Wait, what?

927
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,780
Wait, what?

928
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,980
Oh shit!

929
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,540
It's okay, I'm faster than the laser.

930
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,280
Alright.

931
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,440
Nice.

932
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,940
Oh my God.

933
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,020
Oh my God.

934
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,300
Oh my God!

935
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,000
Okay.

936
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,220
Okay.

937
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,440
I just...

938
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,480
I go in and poke them and then I...

939
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,180
Oh, okay.

940
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,060
I think he's gonna do the laser attack again.

941
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:52,840
Right?

942
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,620
Yeah.

943
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,960
It's fine, I'm faster than the laser.

944
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,920
I think.

945
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,340
I go in a circle.

946
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,280
I loop-de-loop.

947
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,020
That's right, get loop-de-loop.

948
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,440
Oh!

949
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh shit!

950
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,140
Oh shit!

951
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,600
That's...

952
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,380
Oh no!

953
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,340
He stomped on me!

954
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,600
Ah!

955
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,600
He stomped on me!

956
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,380
Oh my God!

957
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,960
He fucking...

958
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,140
Oh my God, it's not fair!

959
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,960
Wait, do I have enough for upgrades?

960
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,300
Oh, I do.

961
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,660
Alright, guys.

962
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,600
What is the optimal upgrade?

963
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,080
I can't believe it!

964
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,960
He fucking stomped on me!

965
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:34,960
Oh!

966
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,580
Alright, damage first.

967
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,260
Alright.

968
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,320
Strength first.

969
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,620
Yeah.

970
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,300
Okay.

971
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,080
We do strength first.

972
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,600
He sat down on me.

973
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,760
And then I died.

974
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,160
It didn't help that I went in with 1 HP.

975
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,320
At least it resets the health pots, right?

976
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
I hope it does.

977
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,500
I'm just gonna run through everything.

978
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,560
Just like...

979
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,060
Just like my Souls game.

980
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,060
Except for him.

981
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,020
Fuck that one guy.

982
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,220
And that guy too.

983
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
Fuck those two guys.

984
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,120
They don't deserve to live.

985
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,440
I think it's this way?

986
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,580
I'll just run through everything.

987
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,060
Okay.

988
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,580
I don't think it's worth, uh...

989
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,600
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

990
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,180
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

991
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,600
Wait, they can fly up here?

992
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,200
That's fucked!

993
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,560
There we go.

994
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,380
Okay.

995
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,340
Alright, give me a sec.

996
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:35,960
Boom, boom.

997
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,740
Okay.

998
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,980
I got an extra bow shot now.

999
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,300
Woah!

1000
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,660
And I got 3 shot.

1001
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,120
Oh, fuck!

1002
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,380
What the fuck?!

1003
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,560
Okay, I'm just...

1004
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,480
I was too greedy.

1005
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,380
I was too greedy.

1006
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,400
I admit.

1007
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,480
And then a loop-de-loop.

1008
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,140
Weeeee!

1009
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,240
I got a little too greedy there.

1010
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,700
I cannot do, like, a charge attack on this guy.

1011
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,520
He fucking...

1012
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,440
He, like...

1013
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,380
He moves too fast for...

1014
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:10,980
Oh, shit!

1015
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,320
Like, I can only hit him, like, once.

1016
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,280
Or twice, maybe.

1017
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,740
If I'm lucky.

1018
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
If it's nice to me.

1019
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,120
Okay, and then he does the laser too.

1020
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,340
Weeeee!

1021
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,380
You're so stupid!

1022
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,460
Yeah, that's right!

1023
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,980
I'm talking about you!

1024
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,600
You're so stupid!

1025
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,460
That's fucking right!

1026
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,940
That's why you have no eyes!

1027
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,280
Oh, you're right.

1028
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,680
I could do the roll attack.

1029
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,400
Oh, you're right.

1030
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,100
That's smart.

1031
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,600
Okay, is he gonna do the thing again?

1032
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,220
Watch this.

1033
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,180
Weeeee!

1034
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,500
Woah!

1035
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,740
Okay.

1036
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,700
Nice.

1037
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,080
I'm just gonna do the roll attack then.

1038
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,580
That's right.

1039
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:09,640
Okay.

1040
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,400
Nice.

1041
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,000
That should be, like, stronger too.

1042
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,100
Woah!

1043
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,440
I rolled into him.

1044
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,340
Accidentally.

1045
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,560
I got a strong attack in.

1046
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:20,560
Alright, do it!

1047
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,240
Do the thing!

1048
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,420
That's right!

1049
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,400
What am I gonna do?

1050
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,920
Oh, shit!

1051
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,580
There's two!

1052
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,100
Oh, no!

1053
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:28,960
Okay.

1054
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,500
I did not expect that.

1055
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,100
Not gonna lie.

1056
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,840
Oh, my god.

1057
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,140
Oh, my god.

1058
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,740
Okay, I can't do roll attacks anymore.

1059
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,580
He attacks too fast for me.

1060
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:44,700
Oh!

1061
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,380
He attacks way too fast now.

1062
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,340
Oh!

1063
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,240
Okay.

1064
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,260
Okay.

1065
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,340
It's okay.

1066
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,980
It's okay.

1067
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,400
I still do it.

1068
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,160
Oh, I can't just loop the loop anymore.

1069
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,020
Oh, he won't let me!

1070
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,220
He's too mad about the...

1071
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,780
Guys, he's too mad about the loop the loop!

1072
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:11,740
Woah!

1073
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:14,800
There we go.

1074
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:16,580
Okay.

1075
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,880
Is he getting closer?

1076
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,940
Oh, nice!

1077
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,520
Goodbye, Casa.

1078
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,380
Fenrir, thank you for the Akasupa!

1079
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,620
Thank you, thank you!

1080
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,480
Hey, Toki!

1081
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,240
Oh, thank you for your very first Akasupa!

1082
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,300
That's right!

1083
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,100
Get down!

1084
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,300
This is Kroki's house now.

1085
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,380
Your very first Akasupa or Super Chat in general!

1086
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,840
Gah!

1087
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,220
Jake, it's my birthday, but I won't be able to watch it live.

1088
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,220
So, can you wish me a happy birthday?

1089
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,320
Of course, I can!

1090
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,180
Happy birthday to you!

1091
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,100
Happy birthday to you!

1092
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,120
Happy birthday, dear Fenrir!

1093
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,160
Happy birthday to you!

1094
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,840
Gah!

1095
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,680
Happy birthday, man!

1096
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,400
I almost...

1097
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,740
I almost like...

1098
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,040
I would have to admit...

1099
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,300
I did almost fucking...

1100
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,780
Walked off the bridge.

1101
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,240
It was that close.

1102
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,320
Thank you for this Akasupa!

1103
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,120
Thank you, thank you!

1104
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,960
Pal, thank you for the Super Chat!

1105
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,800
Thank you, thank you!

1106
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,660
Wait, where am I going?

1107
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,580
This way to the summit.

1108
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,180
Oh, I'm still going to the summit.

1109
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,080
Oh, is that a battle or a siege?

1110
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,120
Thank you for the Super Chat, Pal!

1111
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,100
Thank you, thank you!

1112
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,620
Gah!

1113
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,620
Where do I go?

1114
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,380
This way?

1115
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,340
Okay.

1116
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,480
I've been enjoying it so far.

1117
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,480
It's fun.

1118
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,480
I like...

1119
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,840
I like the...

1120
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,440
I really...

1121
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,380
I like the mechanics of this game so far.

1122
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,300
It's not too complicated.

1123
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,000
And the dodging system's fun.

1124
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,660
I'm sad there's no iFrames though.

1125
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,740
It doesn't seem like there's iFrames, but I can't tell.

1126
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,940
I feel like if the...

1127
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,520
I don't know.

1128
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,120
I don't know if it has iFrames.

1129
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,740
There is?

1130
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,860
Oh, there is?

1131
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,200
Okay.

1132
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,760
That's good to know.

1133
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,200
Where does this go?

1134
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,340
I can't reach it.

1135
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:15,780
I'm...

1136
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,520
I can't fly.

1137
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,760
A crow that can't climb.

1138
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:20,840
Fly.

1139
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,860
I can climb.

1140
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,180
I only have one skill and that's just stabby stabby.

1141
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,000
Oh, but it's really tight?

1142
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,020
Why doesn't your...

1143
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,320
Why doesn't...

1144
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,100
Because I broke my arms!

1145
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,300
Is that why you are here?

1146
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,700
They clipped my wings!

1147
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,400
They clipped it!

1148
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,100
Now all I do is stab.

1149
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,920
Oh, hello fledgling.

1150
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,460
Or maybe I'm just a child.

1151
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,000
They gave a child a knife.

1152
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,500
It's not about the crack on his head, but I needed that soul.

1153
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,690
You see, I was a Reaper.

1154
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,130
Just like you.

1155
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:06,910
Just like me?

1156
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,370
Years ago, my Simon invaded capture.

1157
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,310
It took many minutes to track it down to this location.

1158
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,170
Upon arrival, I discovered that it somehow passed through this door.

1159
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:22,590
Inconceivable.

1160
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,050
Do you know where we are, fledgling?

1161
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,330
No?

1162
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,510
Where are we?

1163
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,870
That's a big ass door.

1164
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:30,730
Wait!

1165
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,030
Full Metal Alchemist?

1166
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,310
Oh, it's Death's door!

1167
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,530
Guys, I finished the tutorial!

1168
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,950
Guys, I did it!

1169
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,390
It only took me one hour.

1170
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,230
The end point for all life.

1171
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,810
I thought it was just a legend.

1172
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,590
Oh, he should be older.

1173
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:54,210
As you know, all doors are powered by energy of souls.

1174
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:00,610
Perhaps with a true monumental amount of power, even this one could be forced open.

1175
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,030
Sadly, the soul I stole from you was not enough.

1176
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,270
Sir, they're gonna fire me if I don't bring back that soul.

1177
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:11,850
Sir!

1178
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,290
I'm afraid that our fates are very much intertwined now, fledgling.

1179
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,070
Will you ride me?

1180
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,970
For if your assignment isn't complete, your death is not...

1181
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:24,510
Wait, what?

1182
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:25,910
Wait, what?

1183
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:27,750
What?

1184
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,510
Without the soul that now resides behind this door, you are trapped.

1185
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,610
Just like me.

1186
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,030
Wait, what?

1187
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,450
Why are you doing this?

1188
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:43,190
I was just a random crow you picked out on the street!

1189
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,750
However, fortune may still smile upon us.

1190
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,770
That's fucked up.

1191
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,630
He pointed at a random crow and he's like, you're next.

1192
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,990
This cursed land is hidden to the reapers, somehow untouched by the laws of nature.

1193
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:06,610
The creatures here have the potential to live vastly beyond their years, growing ever larger and more powerful.

1194
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,810
Now I'm gonna become old!

1195
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,730
Just like you!

1196
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:13,650
Now!

1197
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:25,910
I know of three such beings on these isles, whose combined soul energy could grant us the power to wedge this door open.

1198
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,910
To the north lives an old witch, obsessed with escaping the clutches of death.

1199
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:39,930
Beyond the forest to the east, a self-proclaimed king rules over the ruins of the flooded cathedral.

1200
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:48,750
And atop the mountain to the west, a beast of untold years, primal and vicious, with no want or desire.

1201
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:50,490
No!

1202
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:56,910
I'm truly sorry to have entangled you, fledgling.

1203
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:00,790
But my vance here, my body grows weary.

1204
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:02,230
It's your fault!

1205
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,530
I'm gonna be old!

1206
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,510
Your path is your own now.

1207
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:14,390
Either venture into the wilds and reap those giant souls, or choose inaction and suffer fate as this old fool.

1208
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,730
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

1209
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,410
This is your fault.

1210
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,570
Do you wish for guidance on where to head next?

1211
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,390
Okay.

1212
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,830
Okay, north.

1213
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,710
Which way is north?

1214
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,010
I don't have a map.

1215
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,290
That doesn't help me, sir.

1216
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,910
I just need to find another crow.

1217
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,710
I just need to find another crow.

1218
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,350
Clocking in their nine to five and put them through the same hell he put me in.

1219
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,810
That's it.

1220
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,930
That's all I have to do, guys.

1221
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,890
As long as I find the other crow.

1222
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,050
The never-ending cycle, it follows.

1223
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,950
I'm gonna it follow it.

1224
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,140
Alright.

1225
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,560
Hello?

1226
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,220
Oh, this is like a dungeon, right?

1227
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,180
A witch's dungeon.

1228
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,860
I'll go this way.

1229
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,020
Whoa, soul?

1230
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,520
Yippee, soul.

1231
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,200
Bad man?

1232
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,880
Okay, they look like they could come alive.

1233
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,940
They're just standing there like they're gonna fucking come up alive and kill me.

1234
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,040
They do not look like props.

1235
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,660
Okay, I need to go here.

1236
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,900
I like how I'm like prancing.

1237
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,580
Like a crow.

1238
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,660
Because he is a crow.

1239
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,700
No way.

1240
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,440
Wow.

1241
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,480
I can't believe this lamp has legs.

1242
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:58,860
Wow.

1243
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,440
I wonder why they gave this lamp legs, guys.

1244
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,880
I wonder why.

1245
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,080
There we go.

1246
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,980
I like that roll attack.

1247
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Roll attack's cool.

1248
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,220
Like, roll attack's pretty neato.

1249
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,070
Okay, nice.

1250
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,710
What do I do here?

1251
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,810
Is this an elevator?

1252
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,890
Oh, it is!

1253
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,310
Ah, that's cute!

1254
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,710
That's a birdcage elevator.

1255
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,450
That's cute.

1256
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,990
I've never played Hollow Knight, but does this game feel similar to Hollow Knight?

1257
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:44,430
Oh, I can break boxes.

1258
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:44,970
Nope.

1259
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,390
Okay.

1260
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,940
How many plants do I have?

1261
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:51,480
Two.

1262
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,320
Oh, very different.

1263
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,180
Is there anything in those boxes or am I just an asshole?

1264
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,680
Ha, silly Doki.

1265
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,080
All crows are assholes.

1266
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:09,410
Okay.

1267
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:11,710
Nice.

1268
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:13,230
There's nothing here.

1269
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:15,490
Nice.

1270
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,790
There's still nothing here.

1271
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,150
Where the fuck does this witch live?

1272
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,230
Burn your weapons and spread joy?

1273
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,270
I don't... I don't think I'll do that.

1274
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,290
Oh, oh!

1275
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:34,850
Oh!

1276
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,670
Oh, I can do the other stuff!

1277
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,970
Wait, that's so smart!

1278
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:45,730
Wait!

1279
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:46,830
You!

1280
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,870
I'm so smart.

1281
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,410
I like that.

1282
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,790
That's a cute mechanic.

1283
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,410
That's right.

1284
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:56,570
Of course I'm smart.

1285
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,210
I'm a crow.

1286
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:00,230
Crows are one of the smartest birds out there.

1287
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,070
Second to like... are they like parrots or cockatiels?

1288
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,610
That's why they live longer.

1289
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:15,050
That's why caring for like a cockatiel is like caring for a child that never grows up.

1290
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:22,210
That's why it's like people who own like big birds like power to you.

1291
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,650
Cause they're very annoying.

1292
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,970
I think like... I think like ravens are the smartest, right?

1293
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:46,770
There's like a specific type of crow or raven that like is like one of the smartest birds out there.

1294
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,050
I wanna say crows are the smartest.

1295
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,150
I think a raven is.

1296
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,230
Hello there, my... like a specific type of raven.

1297
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,050
My beak-faced fellow.

1298
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,090
Oh my god!

1299
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:07,090
Is this... Is this the crow's world of the... of the bucket head guy?

1300
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,130
Magpies.

1301
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,090
Am I thinking about magpies?

1302
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:11,370
Yeah!

1303
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,590
This is like the crow version of the pothead guy.

1304
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:19,590
It's quite unusual to see one of your kind upon these isles.

1305
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,450
I imagine you must be here for a soul.

1306
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,290
Not me, I should hope.

1307
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:29,330
Anyway, it seems our paths have intersected in an opportune unmoved moment.

1308
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:33,450
You may not have noticed, but I have been cursed with an unusual affliction.

1309
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:40,490
Alas, judge me not by the shape of my head, but by the deliciousness of the soup inside.

1310
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,130
Pothead.

1311
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,210
Wait, his name is actually Pothead!

1312
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,870
Where are my manners?

1313
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:53,430
I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance, beak-faced.

1314
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,550
The literal Pothead.

1315
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,790
It would seem that my journey has reached an impasse.

1316
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:04,590
I haven't been able to overcome the obstacles ahead and lock the iron gates.

1317
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:09,530
If you would help me move on, I should be indebted to you and we could push forward together.

1318
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,910
Stabby stabby.

1319
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,950
Alright, I have to help him move some stuff.

1320
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:17,530
Do I have enough?

1321
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,790
Oh, I don't have enough souls.

1322
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:19,070
350.

1323
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,470
No, I don't have enough for upgrade.

1324
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,710
Not so dead, Pua.

1325
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:22,990
Thank you for the super chat.

1326
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,170
Thank you.

1327
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,590
Just wait for it.

1328
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,090
God, just wait for it.

1329
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,750
For Silksong to play Hollow Knight.

1330
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:38,110
Alright, surely I'll get it in 10 years, right?

1331
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,270
Oh shit, wait, he has a bow?

1332
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,130
That's not fair.

1333
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,310
Oh shit, how did I miss that?

1334
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,750
Does this go through?

1335
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,230
Okay, no it doesn't.

1336
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:48,870
That's good to know.

1337
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,090
Okay.

1338
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,830
Guys, look.

1339
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,070
Death perception is really hard.

1340
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:00,790
Okay.

1341
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,610
Oh my god, I can't.

1342
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,910
I just suddenly forgot how to play the game.

1343
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,950
Okay, I like that.

1344
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:17,790
I don't know how, but I just suddenly forgot how to play this game after that one fight.

1345
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,570
Oh fuck, that's illegal!

1346
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:27,990
What the fu- Okay, I'm not doing anything fancy no more.

1347
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,270
I'm just gonna X.

1348
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,830
No more fancy shit from me.

1349
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:41,710
I try to be a little fancy and use my charge attack, but never again.

1350
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,760
Okay.

1351
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,240
Unless- Okay, that worked though.

1352
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,640
That worked though, guys.

1353
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,920
That worked, so it's fine.

1354
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,140
That worked, so I can do it.

1355
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,080
Okay, nice.

1356
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,040
Yeah, yippee!

1357
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,320
Okay, up I go.

1358
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,760
Okay, let's- I'm still like 1 HP.

1359
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,900
I'm not gonna plant yet.

1360
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,480
I still have like 1 extra.

1361
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,660
Wait, but how do I do this?

1362
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,620
I'm scared.

1363
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,400
What is this?

1364
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,280
Okay, okay, I had to be sure, okay?

1365
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:32,520
I gotta- I was like- I was- I almost- I almost tried to hit it with my sword.

1366
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,420
Okay.

1367
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,080
Jesus Christ, this bitch.

1368
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,720
What the fuck?!

1369
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,780
How did that not hit?!

1370
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,820
Okay, now it hits.

1371
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,320
Jesus.

1372
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,160
I'm so bad at that!

1373
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,020
I- I don't know why I'm so bad at that!

1374
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,480
The roll right click.

1375
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:14,450
Okay, no.

1376
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,470
That was just a shortcut.

1377
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,650
Did I do it?

1378
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,050
Did I do the thing that he wanted me to do?

1379
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:24,570
There's so many shortcuts!

1380
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,050
Where am I?!

1381
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,790
Where the fuck am I?!

1382
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:30,690
Okay, I'm here.

1383
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,430
Okay, I got one of them.

1384
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,410
I'm just- I'm confused.

1385
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,050
There's too many places to go.

1386
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:39,710
Oh, there's another HP.

1387
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:40,530
Nice.

1388
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,910
Maybe there's like hidden stuff places too around this area.

1389
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,410
Is there that vitality- Like look, there's like a thing here.

1390
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:51,710
See that?

1391
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,250
How do I get there?

1392
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,610
Why is there a staircase?

1393
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:57,390
Yeah, look!

1394
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:57,710
See?

1395
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,210
How do I- How do I get there?

1396
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,050
Let me in!

1397
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,110
Let me in!

1398
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,710
I know there's a way to get there.

1399
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,930
Oh my god, there's another one!

1400
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,810
How the fuck?

1401
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:16,730
Just fly.

1402
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,710
That's- That's fucked up.

1403
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,230
That's fly, sis.

1404
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,370
Not all crows can fly, guys.

1405
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,250
I can't believe- That is so insensitive, guys.

1406
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,670
That is so insensitive.

1407
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,020
Fly, you fool.

1408
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,310
I could report you right now.

1409
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:49,230
Alright, I went left side right, so...

1410
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,170
Yeah, ableist.

1411
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,330
That's ableist.

1412
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:52,790
That's fucked up.

1413
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:01,380
Okay.

1414
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,100
Okay, nice.

1415
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,360
I got the right click in.

1416
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,120
Alright, let's get over here.

1417
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,160
You know what?

1418
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:13,920
Fuck you.

1419
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,460
Fuck you.

1420
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,760
Yeah, that's right.

1421
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,800
You think you're better at being a bozeman than me?

1422
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,120
Get out of here.

1423
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:23,980
Oh shit!

1424
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:25,880
Okay.

1425
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,280
Yes!

1426
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,180
Look at that.

1427
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,420
I'm a gamer.

1428
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,500
Okay, I knew I could kill him before.

1429
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,280
Oh shit, what if he fucking kills me there?

1430
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,680
Oh fuck.

1431
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,300
Wait, okay.

1432
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,000
I got him.

1433
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,100
Nice.

1434
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,880
Oh, it's like a little trap.

1435
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,780
The guardian of peace.

1436
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,100
Don't worry.

1437
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,900
I'll come in peace, guys.

1438
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,580
Oh shit.

1439
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,000
What if I just...

1440
01:05:59,100 --> 01:05:59,940
Oh nice.

1441
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,220
Oh, I could've killed him right there!

1442
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,460
Oh, I wish I did.

1443
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
That would've been so cool.

1444
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,680
Not gonna lie, that would've been so cool if I did that.

1445
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,900
Jesus, fuck you.

1446
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,280
Yeah.

1447
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,180
I know you can't get me there.

1448
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,160
Jesus, get back here!

1449
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,920
There we go.

1450
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,920
Yeah, that's right.

1451
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,600
Get your ass back here.

1452
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:34,090
Okay, this should be a shortcut.

1453
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,550
Um, I don't know if I should waste my heals.

1454
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,250
I won't.

1455
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,010
Actually, fuck, okay.

1456
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,330
I'll get the shortcut here.

1457
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,570
And then...

1458
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,170
Okay, if I get hit here, I'll use my heals.

1459
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,670
But I don't think I will.

1460
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:53,870
Because I'm a gamer.

1461
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,240
I feel like it was gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy right there.

1462
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,640
I thought I was gonna get hit.

1463
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,800
Oh shit.

1464
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,480
Okay, nice.

1465
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:14,800
Okay.

1466
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,920
Nice, got it.

1467
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:21,970
No.

1468
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:22,850
No!

1469
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,290
It auto-locks!

1470
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:25,730
It's not fair!

1471
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,010
Oh, thank God that doesn't hit me.

1472
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:31,670
It auto-locked!

1473
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,120
Okay, I feel like there might be a boss fight out there.

1474
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,960
The Guardian of Peace is fucking collapsed.

1475
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,920
I'm gonna get a heal.

1476
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,960
Just cause, like, the Guardian of Peace does not look so good.

1477
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,380
There's like a portal somewhere here.

1478
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,000
Look, there's another portal.

1479
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,440
How the fuck do I get there?

1480
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,840
Without flying!

1481
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,960
Om nom nom nom.

1482
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,440
Heal time!

1483
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,200
Okay.

1484
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,980
I'll go this way.

1485
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,520
Roll time.

1486
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,220
Roll, roll, roll.

1487
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,580
Just fly.

1488
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,760
Fly in the bushes.

1489
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:20,660
Are you stupid?

1490
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:21,940
Hurrah!

1491
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,660
We can now venture onward, my steadfast companion.

1492
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,540
But first, we should grant ourselves a moment of respect.

1493
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,980
Come, sit with me for a while.

1494
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,380
Oh my God, would he have healed me?

1495
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,660
Oh my God, I'm so cute.

1496
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:39,060
As I mentioned upon our meeting, I was not always quite so earthenware in appearance.

1497
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:47,920
A strange curse was visited upon me by the wicked old lady who resides in the mansion beyond these lavish gardens.

1498
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,480
I imagine you're here for her, are you not?

1499
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:58,640
Surely her soul must be swollen and ripe for the reaping due to her unnaturally extended years.

1500
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:12,010
I desire not but to confront the old witch and request she undo her ceramic deed and restore me to my former handsome self.

1501
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,770
I was quite the looker, you know.

1502
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,170
Really?

1503
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:17,790
Soup?

1504
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:18,870
Sure.

1505
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,830
I'll eat your- wait, no.

1506
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:21,890
Come on, I'm hungry.

1507
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,310
So be it.

1508
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,110
Let us push once more.

1509
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,750
Isn't that like part of his brain?

1510
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:31,990
If I'd eat your soup, would you lose more brain cells?

1511
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,230
I'm here asking important questions.

1512
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,610
I like this.

1513
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,630
Oh, fuck!

1514
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,010
It was green!

1515
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,830
I was like, friendly?

1516
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:53,090
How was I supposed to know?

1517
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,970
It was green!

1518
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,330
Green for HP!

1519
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:58,810
Yeah!

1520
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:03,390
Green for HP, guys.

1521
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:07,490
It broke the fundamental rule.

1522
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:12,830
I can't believe it.

1523
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,090
It broke the number one rule.

1524
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,490
Green for HP.

1525
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,580
Wait, then like, what the fuck was the point of that?

1526
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,340
Oh, this has to be short.

1527
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,660
This has to be a secret.

1528
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,680
Yippee!

1529
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,110
Yeah!

1530
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,490
Green like the...

1531
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,290
Like the nitro boxes.

1532
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,310
Exactly!

1533
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,850
We've all done it once.

1534
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,990
Don't lie.

1535
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,170
You've all done it once.

1536
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,670
Why was there a maze here?

1537
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,290
Oh, I don't like this area.

1538
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:05,710
Oh, fuck!

1539
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,790
Oh, I don't like this area at all.

1540
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:12,590
No!

1541
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,270
Okay, okay, we gotta run.

1542
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,010
We gotta run.

1543
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,090
But I need to break this guy first.

1544
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:18,430
Okay.

1545
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:19,670
Okay, guys.

1546
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:20,610
I need HP.

1547
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:22,510
I blame green.

1548
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:28,630
I blame that one guy that I thought was...

1549
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,230
That I thought was like an actual healer.

1550
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,150
Where did he go?

1551
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:34,390
Okay.

1552
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,230
Oh, I missed.

1553
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,370
I can't wait for like the other weapons.

1554
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:46,690
To see how the gameplay changes.

1555
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,090
Let's see.

1556
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:51,990
Oh, there's so many places to go.

1557
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,050
Croaky's overwhelmed.

1558
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,890
Croaky's so overwhelmed.

1559
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:58,250
Where do I go?

1560
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,750
You mean it's not linear?

1561
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:04,810
Oh, no.

1562
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,390
Croaky's worst enemy.

1563
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,130
When it's not linear.

1564
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,650
Maybe if I can...

1565
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:13,550
No, follow him.

1566
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:14,990
No, follow him.

1567
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:16,690
No, no, no, no.

1568
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,730
Oh, my God.

1569
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:20,950
I hate that it's not...

1570
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,070
That it doesn't follow him.

1571
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,610
Maria, thank you for the super chat.

1572
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,630
Thank you, thank you.

1573
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:26,110
Gah!

1574
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:27,830
Hey, Doki.

1575
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,630
I just finished work and it's my birthday.

1576
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,350
Can I get a happy birthday, please?

1577
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,590
Of course you can!

1578
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,570
Happy birthday to you.

1579
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,930
Happy birthday to you.

1580
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,270
Happy birthday, dear Maria.

1581
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,930
Happy birthday to you.

1582
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:42,310
Gah!

1583
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,390
Happy birthday!

1584
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,670
Alright.

1585
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,450
Oh, that looks like a boss fight right there.

1586
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,930
That looks like a juicy one.

1587
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:55,510
Okay, let me go over here real fast.

1588
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:56,490
Alright, here we go.

1589
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:57,530
Hello, sir.

1590
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:58,350
Friendly?

1591
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,570
Why do I even ask that?

1592
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,930
We all know you're not friendly.

1593
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:06,330
Jesus Christ.

1594
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:06,770
Wait.

1595
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,830
Wait, he's blind.

1596
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,030
Wait, he's stupid.

1597
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:17,890
Okay.

1598
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,810
Oh, he's plus 50.

1599
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,610
Yeah, no fucking wonder.

1600
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,550
He's blind.

1601
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:28,630
He's blind.

1602
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:30,470
Bro, I get more from picking these up.

1603
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,170
This is a plus 100.

1604
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:34,510
He was a plus 50.

1605
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,050
Very friendly.

1606
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,830
Yeah, he was definitely friendly.

1607
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:40,970
The garden of life.

1608
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:41,390
Ooh.

1609
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,630
Okay.

1610
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:47,130
Where'd I go?

1611
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,370
Is there a fire here?

1612
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:50,710
No.

1613
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,470
How do I light this?

1614
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,330
Oh, I don't think I need to light it up anyway.

1615
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:55,790
Oh.

1616
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:58,870
Oh, these guys.

1617
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,670
I don't have to worry too much about them.

1618
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:01,810
That was a plus one.

1619
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,230
I think there has to be something over here.

1620
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,870
Because it's just like... nothing.

1621
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,070
Hello?

1622
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:10,990
Friendly?

1623
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,350
Oh shit.

1624
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,250
Oh, these guys.

1625
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:15,370
Oh fuck!

1626
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:15,610
No!

1627
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:16,130
No!

1628
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,030
Oh shit!

1629
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:19,750
Okay.

1630
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:21,970
Okay.

1631
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:24,590
Okay, I appreciate that though.

1632
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:28,070
At least they're hurting themselves.

1633
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:31,230
Okay.

1634
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:33,390
Oh, they can hit themselves here too!

1635
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,870
Okay.

1636
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,830
That's good to know.

1637
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,130
Oh, there's way too many enemies now.

1638
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:39,150
Oh.

1639
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:44,710
They like increase the difficulty of the game by just putting more enemies.

1640
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,290
Oh, I don't like that.

1641
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,270
It's like harder to deal with.

1642
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:53,090
When it starts getting too cluttered.

1643
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,030
Okay, nice.

1644
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:57,850
Nice.

1645
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:02,840
If I can like...

1646
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,660
Like, how do I...

1647
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,580
I think I have to have a special ability.

1648
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,300
To cross the water?

1649
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,200
Yeah.

1650
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,120
I'm not even supposed to be here.

1651
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,160
Dude, I have like this anchor thing so...

1652
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,080
Oh no, I have to backtrack.

1653
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:16,900
No!

1654
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,180
I gotta backtrack later.

1655
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,520
When I gain my special ability.

1656
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,600
Or, you know, fly.

1657
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,460
That's fucked up.

1658
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,960
That's insensitive, guys.

1659
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,840
Poki's a ground bird today.

1660
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,260
Oh, wait, where am I?

1661
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,500
Oh, oh, fuck!

1662
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,400
Oh my god, I...

1663
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:50,640
No!

1664
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,400
Oh, there's too many...

1665
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:55,320
No!

1666
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,040
There's too many things!

1667
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:06,940
Oh my god.

1668
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,360
That's right.

1669
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,840
Krooky had an accident.

1670
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,620
Makes you feel like shit, don't ya?

1671
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:23,020
Oh my god, what do you mean there's more?

1672
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,920
No, I fucking walked into the arrow!

1673
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,240
The accident of 1987.

1674
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:41,020
Oh my god, I actually ran into the arrow.

1675
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,580
I can't believe it.

1676
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,720
I'm so sad.

1677
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,660
It's okay, I can run through everything.

1678
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,380
I don't remember how I got there though.

1679
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,040
Oh, wait, where am I?

1680
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,520
Oh, wait, where am I?

1681
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,160
Where am I?

1682
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,300
I don't remember.

1683
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:55,880
There's...

1684
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,340
Why did I run through everything?

1685
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,220
Am I stupid?

1686
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,280
Where am I?

1687
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,440
Oh, it's this way.

1688
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,620
Oh, guys, I fucked up.

1689
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,940
I fucked up.

1690
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,940
Oh my god.

1691
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,960
Guys, I don't want to run...

1692
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,940
Okay, I'm resetting.

1693
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:17,880
I'm resetting this.

1694
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,020
I'm resetting.

1695
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,420
Alright, where am I?

1696
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,260
Still...

1697
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,960
I still don't know where I am.

1698
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,980
Okay, we go down here.

1699
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,060
Okay, it's this way.

1700
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:34,720
Alright.

1701
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:35,660
Hello, sir.

1702
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,740
I need an upgrade.

1703
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,180
I want to get...

1704
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,020
Can I get HP?

1705
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,360
Guys, what do I get?

1706
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,180
What would be better?

1707
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,460
I don't know what to get.

1708
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,600
Rupert's speed and grace of movement.

1709
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,840
Rupert giving this...

1710
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,360
I feel like...

1711
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:55,920
Do I need...

1712
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,580
Speed would be good.

1713
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,900
Okay, I'll do speed.

1714
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,420
Meep, thank you for 10 gifted shivs.

1715
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:02,740
Thank you.

1716
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:03,640
Thank you.

1717
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:04,160
Ha!

1718
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,500
Okay, I'm a little faster now.

1719
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,360
That's right, chase this.

1720
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,900
That's right, you can't chase this when I'm fast as fuck.

1721
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,300
Boy.

1722
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,280
I do not...

1723
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,440
I cannot tell if I'm faster.

1724
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:20,900
I cannot tell at all.

1725
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:24,740
Also, don't...

1726
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,400
Oh, there he is.

1727
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,700
Why didn't you help me?

1728
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,400
You said you'd get my rear.

1729
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,980
Where the fuck was...

1730
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:31,300
What...

1731
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:31,480
Where?

1732
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,620
Where was it?

1733
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,280
Okay, it was like this way.

1734
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,180
I wonder if I have to fight that big boy again.

1735
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,840
Is he still alive?

1736
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,320
No, he's dead dead.

1737
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,560
Well, thank god at least he doesn't come alive.

1738
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,060
Okay, it was this way.

1739
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:50,880
And he lied to me.

1740
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,080
He was like, don't worry, pal.

1741
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:54,360
I'll save you.

1742
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,840
I'll make sure you have backup.

1743
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,240
And I'm like, backup where?

1744
01:18:58,980 --> 01:18:59,520
Where backup?

1745
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,480
I hear sparkles behind me.

1746
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,920
What the fuck is sparkling?

1747
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,420
Guess I'll never know.

1748
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,320
Alright, this way.

1749
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:18,250
How did I...

1750
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,230
Oh, here I...

1751
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,410
Jesus, how I died.

1752
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:21,570
I remember now.

1753
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:25,830
Jesus Christ.

1754
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,450
Jesus Christ.

1755
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:28,710
Okay.

1756
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:33,150
Alright, we got one down.

1757
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,370
There we go.

1758
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,550
Other one down too.

1759
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,050
Oh, oh, don't...

1760
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:41,250
Don't...

1761
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,350
Oh, fuck!

1762
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,790
I keep running into them by accident.

1763
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,270
Okay, thank god he...

1764
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:49,330
Okay.

1765
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:50,930
Okay, that's good.

1766
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:51,470
That's good.

1767
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,270
I'm glad that he like ran in there by himself.

1768
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,830
That's really helpful.

1769
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:56,870
Not gonna lie.

1770
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,750
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of these guys first.

1771
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:03,190
Okay, nice.

1772
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,890
Come on, show up.

1773
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,250
That's right, you think...

1774
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,750
You think being up there is gonna save you?

1775
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:13,530
Get closer.

1776
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,350
That's fucking right.

1777
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:16,590
Get your ass over here.

1778
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,390
I'm loaded up.

1779
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:20,530
There we go.

1780
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,390
Oh, I can smack the spells?

1781
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,770
Oh, wait.

1782
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:26,890
That's good to know.

1783
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,110
Wait, is that another weapon?

1784
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,390
These blades can...

1785
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,810
Oh, I got a new weapon!

1786
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,250
Damage 0.86...

1787
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:38,610
Oh, wait.

1788
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:39,550
It's not even...

1789
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,540
Oh, it's faster.

1790
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,200
Oh, it's a lot faster.

1791
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,880
Alright, let's try this out.

1792
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,180
Dagger time.

1793
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,680
I thought I was gonna throw the dagger, not gonna lie.

1794
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,180
I should be able to sit on that chair.

1795
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,480
Okay, let's go.

1796
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,140
I will make a good statue, would I not?

1797
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,020
What did you do?

1798
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,680
So here we are.

1799
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,180
Okay,

1800
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:30,460
goodbye.

1801
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,080
I need to unlock this area first, guys.

1802
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,160
Okay.

1803
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,160
Shit!

1804
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,040
Oh my god, there's the arrow.

1805
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,260
Okay.

1806
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,920
Oh, fuck!

1807
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,700
God damn it, I'm taking everything to the face right now.

1808
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,500
I'm taking it all to the face.

1809
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,440
Okay, I need to heal.

1810
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,380
No, it's fine.

1811
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,740
I'll be okay.

1812
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,750
It's okay, guys.

1813
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,350
Everything will be okay.

1814
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:14,390
Wait, what?

1815
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:16,890
Is this a puzzle?

1816
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,090
What the fuck?

1817
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,120
It doesn't even tell me how to beat this puzzle.

1818
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:36,640
Fucking nerd.

1819
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,680
It's like, give me an answer.

1820
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,660
What the fuck?

1821
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,500
Where did you come from?

1822
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,280
Read?

1823
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,920
It says a family tomb.

1824
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,400
What do you mean, read?

1825
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,700
There's one piece of dialogue.

1826
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,080
Apparently not.

1827
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,080
Apparently, I don't know where the fuck that meant.

1828
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:11,600
Fucking read.

1829
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,180
Read doesn't help.

1830
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:15,900
Oh, there he is.

1831
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,540
Oh no, it just says the garden of love.

1832
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,650
Fucking read.

1833
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:23,850
Read my ass.

1834
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,730
Anything here?

1835
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,710
I'm gonna die here, aren't I?

1836
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,060
This feels like a death area.

1837
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,560
Why is it so empty?

1838
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,600
I don't like the emptiness.

1839
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,480
I feel like there's something that's supposed to be here.

1840
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,060
Alright, let's cover him now.

1841
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,380
Sorry, I was a little distracted.

1842
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,780
If you go ahead, I'll guard the door.

1843
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,840
Wow, thank you.

1844
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,980
Thank you so much.

1845
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,320
What?

1846
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,100
Oh.

1847
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,520
Okay, let me get HP real fast.

1848
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,360
Don't worry.

1849
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,320
I'll be right back.

1850
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,960
Real helpful.

1851
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,240
Oh shit.

1852
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,860
Oh, I forgot about these guys.

1853
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,280
Oh fuck no, he fucking poofs in.

1854
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,080
It's okay.

1855
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,400
He can't catch me.

1856
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,140
He can't catch me if I just run a little faster.

1857
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,860
Oh, did they regrow?

1858
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,880
Cause I went through the door?

1859
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,240
The fuck's my HP then?

1860
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,080
It's okay, I'll go the long haul.

1861
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:54,720
Oh, they did!

1862
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,660
That's okay.

1863
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,040
Now I went this way.

1864
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,760
That's not okay.

1865
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,260
Don't worry.

1866
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,220
I'll dodge it all.

1867
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,440
Don't worry guys.

1868
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:14,580
I'm just not even gonna- I rather just like- If they're gonna come back, I'm just gonna go back to the door.

1869
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,300
And heal from there.

1870
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,840
Wherever my door is- Oh my god, imagine if I got hit there.

1871
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:24,840
Placebo!

1872
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,500
Thank you for the five gifted shits!

1873
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,700
Thank you, thank you!

1874
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,700
Yeah, but like, it wastes an item.

1875
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,540
To use the- Think again.

1876
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:40,800
It wastes an item and I don't wanna waste my seed.

1877
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,580
Just for like, HP that's next to the door.

1878
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:49,060
It's just more convenient that way.

1879
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:58,050
Wait, does- Oh, the plant regrows?

1880
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:58,890
Wait, what?

1881
01:25:58,970 --> 01:25:59,670
It does?

1882
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,450
Wait, the plant regrows?

1883
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:08,290
So I don't have to worry about it?

1884
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:10,670
I didn't know!

1885
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:11,770
Okay, now I know.

1886
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:16,490
Okay, now I know though.

1887
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:17,430
Guys, I learned.

1888
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:19,690
What the fuck?

1889
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:25,250
Creak.

1890
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,380
What the fuck?

1891
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,720
Oh wait, there's a door.

1892
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,720
I forgot to open the door.

1893
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:35,640
Open the keyhole!

1894
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,120
To my heart.

1895
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,260
Just like Kingdom Hearts.

1896
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,600
Wait, they're all potheads.

1897
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:44,740
Wait.

1898
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,820
Wait a minute.

1899
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:52,880
Is pothead the real witch?

1900
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,580
I hunger for souls.

1901
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,000
Wait a minute.

1902
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,400
Oh, they have heads for pots.

1903
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,240
Or pots for heads.

1904
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,040
Look at them all.

1905
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,020
Wait a minute.

1906
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,760
Is pothead not a good person?

1907
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,200
Okay, I'll plant this now.

1908
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,420
Where do I go?

1909
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:26,280
This way.

1910
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,580
This unassuming chair right there.

1911
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,900
Maybe I can kill all the pots.

1912
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,180
Oh shit!

1913
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,940
Oh, it was a joke!

1914
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,460
Nice.

1915
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,400
Okay.

1916
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,300
Oh my god.

1917
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,120
There's evil pots too.

1918
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:51,180
I didn't think that would actually happen.

1919
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,560
Oh my god!

1920
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,000
No, not the children.

1921
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,840
Not the children.

1922
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,400
Oh, I can hit them back!

1923
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:03,920
Thank god.

1924
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:04,720
Okay, thank god.

1925
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,920
I was a little nervous about that.

1926
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:07,640
I'm glad.

1927
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:09,320
I don't know which is better.

1928
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,840
The knife or the...

1929
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:14,870
Or the dagger.

1930
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,910
Does anyone know which is better?

1931
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,150
The knife or the dagger.

1932
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,270
Okay.

1933
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:25,870
Okay.

1934
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:28,830
That's right!

1935
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:29,950
Be gone, child!

1936
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:33,550
Dagger because it's cool.

1937
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:34,190
True.

1938
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,600
Good answer.

1939
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:42,440
What?

1940
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,280
Just to be sure there's no evil.

1941
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,940
Dagger doesn't stagger?

1942
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,460
Wait, are these staggering?

1943
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,240
I didn't even notice.

1944
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,820
Can I do it?

1945
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,220
Oh.

1946
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,060
I have to do the other side too.

1947
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:04,360
Oh yeah.

1948
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,180
Oh!

1949
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,280
Do I have to curve it?

1950
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,380
Do I have to curve the shot?

1951
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,510
Oh no, I can just do that.

1952
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,330
Nice.

1953
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:16,870
Curve the...

1954
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:17,810
Curve the arrow.

1955
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,070
That's right, child.

1956
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:28,490
Oh look, they're all having a little dinner party!

1957
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:30,730
Look at that!

1958
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,440
Making sure there's no evil jars.

1959
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,520
Not paranoid at all.

1960
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,000
Get out of here, child.

1961
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,960
Is there any secret here?

1962
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:45,780
Any secret?

1963
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:51,470
That's right.

1964
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,070
I'm gonna crash your party!

1965
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,630
Okay, nice.

1966
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,170
Oh wait, there's one more.

1967
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:01,710
Oh!

1968
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:02,850
It's right here!

1969
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,230
Wait, how do I get there?

1970
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:06,650
Wait, what?

1971
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:12,290
Wait, what?

1972
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,590
I can't jump!

1973
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:18,710
How do I get up there?

1974
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:24,090
Can I roll?

1975
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,890
Oh fuck!

1976
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:26,750
Oh, oh, oh!

1977
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:31,510
That's when you...

1978
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:33,230
That's when I have a Eureka moment.

1979
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:34,670
That's three O's.

1980
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,810
Can I get three O's in chat?

1981
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,230
It's like the boom guy.

1982
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:42,670
It's that boom I go.

1983
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:43,490
Oh!

1984
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:45,870
There you go.

1985
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,360
There's a bad jar here somewhere.

1986
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,280
I can feel it.

1987
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,940
Wait, what?

1988
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:10,180
Wait, what?

1989
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:14,580
What?

1990
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,340
What is this puzzle?

1991
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:26,600
Oh!

1992
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,440
I figured it out, guys.

1993
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:37,330
It's this way.

1994
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:42,210
Uh...

1995
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:43,230
Oops.

1996
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:47,230
Simple geometry.

1997
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,470
Right there.

1998
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:51,390
Um...

1999
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:52,430
Oh fuck.

2000
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,570
Oh, give me a sec.

2001
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,570
I need a think.

2002
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:57,670
Alright.

2003
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,110
We're mathing right now.

2004
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:03,670
And then we do it here.

2005
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:06,190
I assume there is one over here.

2006
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:07,890
Simple geometry.

2007
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:09,990
And then...

2008
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,470
Here.

2009
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,370
Oh my god.

2010
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:16,250
Easiest puzzle of my life.

2011
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:18,090
Get out of here.

2012
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:20,990
That's right.

2013
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,870
You're seeing the wrinkles on my brain get wrinklier and wrinklier.

2014
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:26,690
Jesus Christ.

2015
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,370
What the fuck?

2016
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:28,550
The fuck?

2017
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,090
Oh, am I target practicing this?

2018
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:31,250
Oh!

2019
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:34,490
Oh shit.

2020
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:36,850
Oh fuck!

2021
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:38,910
Wait, what?

2022
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,190
How do I kill you?

2023
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:45,170
Am I...

2024
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:46,130
Am I killing it?

2025
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,030
No.

2026
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,010
Oh, I am.

2027
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:51,330
I am.

2028
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:51,570
Okay.

2029
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:53,490
I am.

2030
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:54,130
Okay, that's good.

2031
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:55,550
I couldn't tell.

2032
01:32:59,430 --> 01:32:59,910
Alright.

2033
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:01,170
That's right.

2034
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:01,770
Get over here.

2035
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:03,510
Get that child over here.

2036
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:06,950
That's right.

2037
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:07,990
Oh shit.

2038
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:10,790
That's right.

2039
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:11,670
Spit that child out.

2040
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,310
Send it back to where it came from.

2041
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,180
Oh fuck.

2042
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:18,640
What?

2043
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,460
That shouldn't have hit me.

2044
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,580
Oh my god.

2045
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,360
There's so many...

2046
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,280
Drago's birthday.

2047
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:25,880
Happy birthday everybody.

2048
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:27,860
Wait.

2049
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:31,760
Why is today a very special day for births?

2050
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,820
Guys, minus nine months for me, guys.

2051
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,040
What month is it?

2052
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,860
You decided to use the bathroom.

2053
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:42,580
Alright, bro.

2054
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,620
I wish you a happy birthday before I go to the bathroom.

2055
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:46,700
Happy birthday to you.

2056
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:47,460
Alright.

2057
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,060
Sydney, thank you for the superchat.

2058
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,400
Thank you.

2059
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,100
Thank you.

2060
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,720
Oh shit.

2061
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,320
Oh, that your parents were so...

2062
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:01,660
It was a special...

2063
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:02,600
There's a special...

2064
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,560
There's some special days in July.

2065
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,980
Or June.

2066
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,300
Oh, you're right.

2067
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:13,340
Summer vacation.

2068
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,480
Happy birthday Sydney.

2069
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,360
Happy birthday to you.

2070
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,120
Happy birthday to you.

2071
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:22,040
Happy birthday dear Sydney.

2072
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,940
Happy birthday to you.

2073
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:24,420
Yeah.

2074
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,080
Thank you for playing.

2075
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:27,840
Of course.

2076
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,020
It's a croquis game.

2077
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:30,800
Alright, I'll be right back.

2078
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:32,400
I am...

2079
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,580
Because there were so many birthdays today.

2080
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:38,160
Usually, I do like one or two.

2081
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,840
But I think I like wish like five birthdays today.

2082
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:42,940
That means...

2083
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,620
Minus nine months.

2084
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,080
There was something special.

2085
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,280
There was something special nine months ago.

2086
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,640
I'll be right back.

2087
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,540
Bathroom time.

2088
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,780
Bathroom break for croquis.

2089
01:36:24,450 --> 01:36:26,150
Alright, I'm back guys.

2090
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:28,730
Evan, Mike, Matty, Rice.

2091
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,510
Thank you for the super chat.

2092
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:31,730
Thank you, thank you.

2093
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,670
Alright, let me...

2094
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:33,770
Wow.

2095
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:35,830
Let me double check something real quick.

2096
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,850
Before croquis goes back in.

2097
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:41,590
Alright.

2098
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:43,870
Alright.

2099
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:45,510
Here we go.

2100
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:50,030
Climb up.

2101
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:51,370
Johnny, parpa.

2102
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,610
Thank you for the super chat.

2103
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:53,710
Thank you, thank you.

2104
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:56,490
Not so dead, pa.

2105
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:57,850
Thank you for the super chat.

2106
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:58,110
Thank you...

2107
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:58,730
What the fuck?

2108
01:36:59,130 --> 01:36:59,670
For the super chat.

2109
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:00,730
Thank you, thank you.

2110
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:03,350
Hello?

2111
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:06,210
It appears we've been abandoned here.

2112
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:08,490
I don't think anyone is coming to open the door.

2113
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,230
Give me your soul.

2114
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,910
Croquis demands your soul.

2115
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:19,010
Four of them?!

2116
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:23,090
Oh my god, there's four lost souls in here?!

2117
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:27,780
Wait, how do I get out?

2118
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:30,800
Do I have to walk back?

2119
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,700
That's fucked.

2120
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,060
What the fuck?

2121
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,160
I have to walk back?!

2122
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,560
Croquis mad.

2123
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,000
Caw dollars.

2124
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,620
Thank you for the super chat, Coyote.

2125
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:51,840
Thank you, thank you.

2126
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:52,600
Caw.

2127
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:56,960
What the fuck?

2128
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:03,390
Wait a minute.

2129
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:04,870
Who are you?

2130
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,570
Wait, is that the witch?

2131
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:12,470
It looks like the Ghibli witch.

2132
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:21,950
The deal is off?

2133
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:26,830
What brings an adorable fellow like you into my little house?

2134
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:27,290
Deal.

2135
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:33,630
I just laughed there.

2136
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,010
Sorry, ma'am.

2137
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:39,710
Sorry.

2138
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,200
I just laughed.

2139
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:45,310
It's just like, what the fuck?

2140
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:48,990
She was trying to have a conversation with me.

2141
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:51,410
Oh yeah, I don't have to.

2142
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:52,350
Thank God.

2143
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:56,370
That was my bad.

2144
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,050
I didn't realize she was so slappable.

2145
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:04,070
How do I get out of here?

2146
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:06,850
I slapped her and I don't know where to go.

2147
01:39:08,530 --> 01:39:10,030
A tabby, thank you for the super chat.

2148
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:11,030
Thank you, thank you.

2149
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:11,630
Caw.

2150
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:14,050
Chat, I'm so hungry.

2151
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,070
Oh, nice.

2152
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:16,930
What do I eat for dinner?

2153
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:17,850
Pizza or burger?

2154
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:18,470
I'm hungry.

2155
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,210
I might eat this crow on screen.

2156
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:21,390
You should...

2157
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:21,990
Oh, fuck.

2158
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:23,670
Oh, it's exploding, guys.

2159
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:25,450
You should get...

2160
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:27,050
Pizza.

2161
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,690
Pizza is always good.

2162
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:32,270
I'm gonna grab heals real quick.

2163
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,270
Okay, I grew it there.

2164
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:36,110
I'm just gonna get max HP.

2165
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:36,670
Oh, what?

2166
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:36,990
Hello.

2167
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:48,690
Alright, let's...

2168
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:51,070
Heal yourself.

2169
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:52,750
Oh, she's right.

2170
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,590
Why not both of you are so hungry?

2171
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:57,230
Aren't you so hungry?

2172
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:04,570
Oh, there's a lot of...

2173
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:08,050
Get out of here.

2174
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,210
That's right, child.

2175
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:09,670
Leave.

2176
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:12,890
Okay, there's that.

2177
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:13,250
Oh, wait.

2178
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:14,470
There's another one right here.

2179
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:15,790
Thought I didn't see, huh?

2180
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:20,130
And then there's...

2181
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:22,470
Extra money.

2182
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,530
Money?

2183
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:26,210
Poki like money.

2184
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:30,470
Where else is there?

2185
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:32,110
Oh, there's a seed right here.

2186
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,730
What the fuck are you gonna do?

2187
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:38,270
Nothing.

2188
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:39,390
Oh, shit.

2189
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:42,990
Whoops.

2190
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:44,650
Apparently, something.

2191
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,500
What the fuck are you gonna do?

2192
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,080
Spin?

2193
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,060
Okay.

2194
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:55,960
Bye.

2195
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:59,540
Okay, this guy I'm a little afraid of.

2196
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,020
Just cause like...

2197
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:03,420
He actually explodes.

2198
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,880
Oh, he doesn't.

2199
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,580
Oh, it's the purple one that explodes.

2200
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,020
I'm a little special.

2201
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:13,300
Poki confused.

2202
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:19,340
Look, even though crows are very intelligent...

2203
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,950
Oh, shit.

2204
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:23,730
Did that hit me?

2205
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:26,410
That is bullshit.

2206
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,430
Are you serious?

2207
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,150
That hit me?

2208
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:33,170
Okay, like I was saying.

2209
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:34,410
Although crows are very...

2210
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:36,830
Very intelligent.

2211
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,890
They are just as intelligent as like a four year old.

2212
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:40,850
I'm pretty sure, right?

2213
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:43,310
Someone can fact check me.

2214
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,930
They're like...

2215
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,830
They're like as intelligent as a toddler.

2216
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:47,510
So like, I'm...

2217
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:50,510
Doesn't really account for much.

2218
01:41:50,590 --> 01:41:51,650
If you think about it.

2219
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,060
Oh, seven year old.

2220
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:58,300
Yeah.

2221
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:02,680
So like, it's not really that much of an improvement.

2222
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:06,760
Ah, fuck.

2223
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:12,980
No, my death field.

2224
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:13,860
No.

2225
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,420
What the fuck?

2226
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:17,340
There we go.

2227
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,560
What's over here?

2228
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,220
Fuck this pot.

2229
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,140
Oh, I guess I can't fuck this pot.

2230
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:30,700
Oh, I can do that.

2231
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,160
Okay.

2232
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:37,290
How do I get up there?

2233
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,430
Oh, I locked it.

2234
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:41,850
Okay.

2235
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:48,350
Again.

2236
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,130
Can't believe it.

2237
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:52,610
I rolled off the same area too.

2238
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:54,610
This way.

2239
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:57,110
I have to go this way.

2240
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,270
I'm liking this game so far.

2241
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:04,450
I feel like if I wasn't streaming it, I definitely...

2242
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:06,730
I definitely would play this off stream.

2243
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,330
As like a...

2244
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:11,650
Like...

2245
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,790
Just like to chill.

2246
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:16,770
It's pretty fun so far.

2247
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:17,910
I'm enjoying it a lot.

2248
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,030
Wait, there's two of you?

2249
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:23,010
Wait, that's not fair.

2250
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:24,610
Wait, what the fuck?

2251
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:26,270
Wait, what the fuck?

2252
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:31,570
Okay, this is actually not fair.

2253
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,580
Oh.

2254
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:38,960
Wait.

2255
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,100
Okay.

2256
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,320
That's bullshit.

2257
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:41,980
That's bullshit!

2258
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:45,980
What?

2259
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,160
Okay.

2260
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,280
That's fucked.

2261
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,000
Where am I?

2262
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,020
Oh, it's this way.

2263
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,380
Okay.

2264
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,320
I was like, where do I go?

2265
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,520
That's actually bullshit.

2266
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,980
I shouldn't have died there.

2267
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,240
Nevermind.

2268
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:07,260
Nevermind.

2269
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,240
Take it all back.

2270
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,360
Jesus.

2271
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:11,460
Stupid.

2272
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:16,820
Remember where...

2273
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:17,620
Oh, it's this way.

2274
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:19,100
Oh my god.

2275
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:21,020
This is the worst part about having no map.

2276
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,700
I'm so disoriented.

2277
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm so confused.

2278
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,100
When I have no map...

2279
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,720
I'm confused.

2280
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:36,040
I'm so confused.

2281
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,880
Okay.

2282
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:45,400
What are you guys doing here?

2283
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:50,790
Get out.

2284
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:06,870
God damn it.

2285
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,450
Fucker.

2286
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:18,150
I can't.

2287
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:19,230
Oh my god.

2288
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:20,890
These guys are so annoying.

2289
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:25,270
Wait, what?

2290
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,610
Oh my god.

2291
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:35,790
Okay.

2292
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:38,470
Oh my god.

2293
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:40,330
Fuckers!

2294
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,540
Oh my god, that's okay.

2295
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:47,820
That's fucking right.

2296
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:50,840
Are you serious?!

2297
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,000
It traveled that far?!

2298
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,500
Get out of here.

2299
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:57,500
Oh, thank god.

2300
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:57,860
Okay.

2301
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:00,600
Oh, fuck.

2302
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:00,940
Okay.

2303
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:02,060
Okay.

2304
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:03,380
I don't like that.

2305
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,500
I don't like that they spawn non-stop until I kill the big guy.

2306
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:11,720
I hate non-stop enemy spawners.

2307
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,280
No thanks.

2308
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,440
Power up my door, soul.

2309
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:22,560
You're just here to be...

2310
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,620
You're just here as a battery for me.

2311
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:29,530
Alright.

2312
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:33,670
Jesus, that's a lot of dead bodies.

2313
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,790
Oh, there she is.

2314
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:38,270
Hello.

2315
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:56,990
What the fuck?

2316
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:58,230
Leave!

2317
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:04,990
That's right.

2318
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:08,510
How could you make your house such a mess?

2319
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:09,450
Slap!

2320
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:18,930
What are you still doing here?

2321
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:19,590
Huh?

2322
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:20,830
Leave!

2323
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:28,410
Wait, is there not a shortcut back home?

2324
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,970
I thought there'd be a shortcut.

2325
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,990
She gave me a shortcut last time.

2326
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:36,170
I guess cause it's like next door.

2327
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:40,210
Croaky is so rude.

2328
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,510
How's there more of you guys?

2329
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:47,570
I'm not your mom!

2330
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:48,970
Get out of here!

2331
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:57,320
You're so rude.

2332
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,760
Alright, next key.

2333
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:06,370
Oh my god!

2334
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:07,430
Why did I do that?

2335
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,680
I didn't know!

2336
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,300
Oh shit.

2337
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,180
Oh shit!

2338
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,480
Okay.

2339
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,200
Jesus Christ.

2340
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:33,240
Okay, I'm not doing so well in this level, guys.

2341
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:37,860
This level fucked me up.

2342
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:40,040
There were too many pots.

2343
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,020
Okay, oh this guy.

2344
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:46,760
Wait, not him?

2345
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,520
This guy?

2346
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,800
Oh, what the fuck?

2347
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,180
He was just standing there.

2348
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:56,320
Oh, he was naked!

2349
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,780
He was naked!

2350
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,960
So he got scared.

2351
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,340
He's like, no, I'm naked now.

2352
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:09,900
No!

2353
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:14,120
He has no pots to cover him up.

2354
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:19,060
Nice.

2355
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:19,660
Oh, wait.

2356
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:20,520
Okay.

2357
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:23,420
Just wanted to re...

2358
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,000
Just get my skill back up.

2359
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:28,180
Jacob, thank you for the super chat!

2360
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,220
Thank you, thank you!

2361
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:29,840
Gah!

2362
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:32,840
Anybody remember the dream key crow show?

2363
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:33,740
What is that?

2364
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:35,020
I actually don't know what that is.

2365
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,880
What is this?

2366
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,100
Oh, I picked up more seeds.

2367
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,040
I need a pot to grow this.

2368
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,500
Get out of here.

2369
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,080
Yeah, I don't trust...

2370
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,340
I don't trust all these random pots just sitting there.

2371
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,060
Okay, wrong one.

2372
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:01,200
They're just sitting there.

2373
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:02,540
Threateningly.

2374
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,080
Okay, we'll go here first.

2375
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,420
Oh hey, it's a little bathtub.

2376
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:11,320
What?

2377
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:12,680
What do I do here?

2378
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:15,600
What?

2379
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,840
Oh!

2380
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,780
It was an invisible key!

2381
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:22,980
Oh!

2382
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,840
Wait, on the other side, there's like a thing here.

2383
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:31,940
Yeah!

2384
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,580
It's like there's another one right here.

2385
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:40,300
There you go.

2386
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:41,660
Oh, that's cool!

2387
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:43,440
Secret!

2388
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,420
I shall pray to my crow gods.

2389
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:49,540
Hello.

2390
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,760
I am here for vitality.

2391
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,840
There was a guy that made fun of me saying that...

2392
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,780
That...

2393
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,940
Saying I couldn't kill him.

2394
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,120
Yay!

2395
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,560
Yay!

2396
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:05,180
Okay, I need three more.

2397
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,610
That's clever.

2398
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:16,350
Okay, one here.

2399
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:23,250
Oh, I'm hearing voices, guys.

2400
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:25,130
Do you guys hear it or am I crazy?

2401
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:30,210
Oh shit.

2402
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:32,130
Guys, do you hear the voices?

2403
01:51:34,050 --> 01:51:35,550
Are y'all hearing the whispers?

2404
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:40,810
Okay, nice.

2405
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:48,020
Guys, Croaky didn't take...

2406
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:49,860
Oh my god, Croaky's not going there.

2407
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,240
Yeah, Croaky's gonna go this way first.

2408
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,820
This way seems more safe.

2409
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,540
Whoa, this way definitely does not seem more safe.

2410
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:06,280
This place looks like a fucking boss battle.

2411
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:13,830
Oh, this is a shortcut!

2412
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:14,890
Oh, nice.

2413
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:15,230
Okay.

2414
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:17,010
Not safe.

2415
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,910
Croaky needs to heal.

2416
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:19,430
No!

2417
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:25,190
Why have you not replenished this for Croaky?

2418
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:26,370
Why?

2419
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:27,910
Get out of here!

2420
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:33,950
Can't believe it.

2421
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,270
I'm like 1 HP.

2422
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:37,510
I need like...

2423
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:39,230
Anything right now.

2424
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:42,510
Please slap this.

2425
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:44,450
Where are my heals, child?

2426
01:52:45,670 --> 01:52:47,510
Children, where are my heals?

2427
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:48,730
Get out of here!

2428
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:55,370
I don't remember where the other heals were.

2429
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:58,010
I like, planted so many seeds.

2430
01:52:58,450 --> 01:53:01,370
But like, where were the heals for all of them?

2431
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,550
There's like one up here, right?

2432
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:09,690
Yeah, there is.

2433
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:11,270
Okay, I'm just gonna go up there then.

2434
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:18,350
Let's grab that one.

2435
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,020
Okay.

2436
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:28,220
Oh my god, the long travel.

2437
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,020
Nice.

2438
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,940
I got my seed insurance.

2439
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:38,440
Sorry, there were too many children.

2440
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,140
Croaky doesn't remember.

2441
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,420
Alright, there we go.

2442
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:55,460
Okay, now I can fight the boss.

2443
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,820
Wait, there's another seed here.

2444
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,320
I'm just leaving them here.

2445
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:05,760
Alright, Croaky's coming over.

2446
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,240
I'm coming over.

2447
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:10,700
What?

2448
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:12,040
Oh.

2449
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:13,940
Shall we dance?

2450
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,160
Okay.

2451
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:17,100
Wait,

2452
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,160
what?

2453
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:24,780
Wait, what?

2454
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:28,960
Will he get tired?

2455
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:33,580
Okay, I learned that I cannot arrow this guy.

2456
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:38,860
Okay.

2457
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:40,880
Oh shit, oh shit.

2458
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:45,200
Wait, no, I can.

2459
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:50,580
I just can't stop the- I just can't stop it.

2460
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,400
I can't CC it like the other ones.

2461
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,960
Oh, he's naked.

2462
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:59,360
Get out of here.

2463
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,940
He's naked now and he's scared.

2464
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:04,900
That's fucking right.

2465
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,820
Yeah, his pot's too strong.

2466
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,620
Where am I now?

2467
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:17,970
Get rid of this child.

2468
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:19,490
And then this child.

2469
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:21,630
I want the money here though.

2470
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:23,890
I need the money.

2471
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:33,140
What the fuck?

2472
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:34,940
Where did you come from?

2473
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:38,540
Oh, my money.

2474
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:41,960
Bro, what?

2475
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:47,300
Like, oh fucking hell.

2476
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,480
Give me a sec.

2477
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:53,200
Okay, give me a sec.

2478
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:59,040
I was trying to- I was trying to figure out where I was.

2479
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,420
Okay, this is not fair.

2480
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:06,620
Oh, he was there?

2481
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,360
That is definitely not fair.

2482
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:13,460
Stupid man.

2483
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,380
Okay, I have to cut it.

2484
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:17,820
Oh, okay.

2485
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,220
I'll grab that later.

2486
01:56:24,940 --> 01:56:25,840
Is there anything?

2487
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:26,320
No.

2488
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:31,550
I feel like there has to be a secret here.

2489
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:33,550
Why else would it lead me all the way here?

2490
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:35,850
Oh my god, seed.

2491
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:38,690
Is that it?

2492
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:40,030
Was that all it was for?

2493
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:43,670
Is there no secret?

2494
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:47,810
Oh no, here it is.

2495
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:48,510
What did I get?

2496
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,050
Now I just have to find someone who would want to marry me?

2497
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:53,250
What the fuck?

2498
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:54,870
Wait, what did I get?

2499
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:55,330
What did I get?

2500
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:03,000
Oh, it's just like a collector's, right?

2501
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:03,780
Like an achievement.

2502
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:07,340
It's just a collectible, right?

2503
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,480
Alright, let's grab this.

2504
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,180
Up we go.

2505
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:16,260
Koki, go up.

2506
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:20,200
Goddammit, so it was useless.

2507
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,620
I wasted all those arrows for nothing.

2508
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:24,460
Oh, I don't like this.

2509
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,300
Can't see anything.

2510
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,660
Oh, I cannot see anything.

2511
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,860
Oh, they're not one-shot anymore.

2512
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,220
Because I'm not using my sword.

2513
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,860
Oh, I like that.

2514
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,360
I like that they're not one-shot.

2515
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:49,040
I might swap my weapon to deal with these guys.

2516
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:50,480
Yeah.

2517
01:57:51,220 --> 01:57:52,600
Oh, fucking hell.

2518
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,920
Just to make sure there's nothing here.

2519
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,400
Okay.

2520
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:00,580
Okay.

2521
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:06,500
So I can one-shot them.

2522
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,700
Whoa, hey guys.

2523
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:12,980
Get out.

2524
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,160
Get out.

2525
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,040
That's right.

2526
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:18,680
Oh, shit!

2527
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:21,500
Okay.

2528
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:25,260
Alright.

2529
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:26,840
Oh, he just stopped.

2530
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,780
He was like, my friend!

2531
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,400
That's right, I killed your friend.

2532
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:35,860
Alright.

2533
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,260
I'm gonna use the sword.

2534
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,240
I think the sword's better.

2535
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,800
I finally realized that.

2536
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:42,940
I think the sword is better.

2537
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,300
Okay.

2538
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:49,060
Hello?

2539
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,660
Oh, there's the other crow.

2540
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:52,980
Hello?

2541
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,860
Why did the door close?

2542
01:58:58,300 --> 01:58:59,840
How can we get back?

2543
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:01,440
Goodbye.

2544
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:01,620
Goodbye.

2545
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:03,980
Now power up my door.

2546
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:06,320
That's your only purpose left.

2547
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:09,240
Life doesn't matter now.

2548
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,120
Okay, we're missing one more.

2549
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:15,160
Alright, we're gonna meet the old granny again.

2550
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:17,980
Oh, goodness.

2551
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:20,640
You're not the cause of all this wreckage, are you?

2552
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:21,760
No, I'm just a crow.

2553
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:23,840
Oh.

2554
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:25,520
Oh, she's not happy.

2555
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:33,860
I would not be very hospitable to any beast who would mistreat my children.

2556
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,780
Tread lightly, reaper.

2557
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:39,860
Bitch.

2558
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,000
Alright, let's go this way.

2559
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:49,880
I don't think she likes me, guys.

2560
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:52,440
Oh, look, there's a... I can't go that way.

2561
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,220
There's a trap door here, but I didn't...

2562
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:00,860
I didn't check what that was over to the right side.

2563
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,080
Slap.

2564
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,480
I didn't check what this was.

2565
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,600
This has to be something, right?

2566
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,560
Oops, missed.

2567
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:16,860
Oops, I missed again.

2568
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:18,240
Oops.

2569
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,920
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

2570
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:26,560
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

2571
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:32,080
There you go.

2572
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:34,900
There we go.

2573
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:35,880
I did it.

2574
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,000
It only took me several tries.

2575
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:41,900
There you go.

2576
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:43,420
Oh yeah, no, this...

2577
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:45,580
Yeah, no, this sword is definitely a lot better.

2578
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:47,640
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

2579
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,580
Oh no, why did I plant my seed there?

2580
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:53,440
Unless it's a boss... Oh, it's a boss, but never mind.

2581
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:54,760
Fuck!

2582
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:54,820
Fuck!

2583
02:00:57,580 --> 02:01:01,160
Oh my god, and there's these guys too?

2584
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:04,720
Sucks.

2585
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,260
This actually sucks.

2586
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:12,580
Oh my god, and there's these guys as well.

2587
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,640
I hate it here.

2588
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:18,620
Okay.

2589
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:21,220
Jesus Christ.

2590
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:22,980
I'm using this against you.

2591
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:26,580
Oh, fuck you!

2592
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:32,700
I hate it.

2593
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:36,520
I hate the infinites.

2594
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:38,360
I hate the infinites so much.

2595
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:39,120
I hate it.

2596
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:39,900
I hate it.

2597
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,460
I hate that it spawns.

2598
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,560
I think that's the one thing I don't like about it.

2599
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:48,860
I don't like that it spawns infinite.

2600
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:57,780
If it was like a set spawn, it's fine, but it's not set at all.

2601
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:02,860
Damn stupid magic user.

2602
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,440
Fight me like a real crow.

2603
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,100
Okay.

2604
02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:24,030
I have to kill all of them before more spawn in too.

2605
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:27,050
Because I'm pretty sure if I don't, more will spawn in.

2606
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:29,910
God, you fucking whore!

2607
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:31,850
You're such a whore!

2608
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:36,640
You're such a whore!

2609
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:46,030
Okay.

2610
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,640
Wait, does it actually not spawn more?

2611
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:52,400
Maybe it doesn't.

2612
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:54,960
Okay, I'm just gonna... I don't think it does actually.

2613
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,380
I know it actually doesn't spawn more.

2614
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,100
Thank God.

2615
02:02:59,180 --> 02:02:59,780
Oh, shit.

2616
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:02,180
No.

2617
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:04,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2618
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:05,700
Okay.

2619
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,020
Okay.

2620
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:10,760
It doesn't spawn more.

2621
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:11,520
Okay, now I know.

2622
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:12,680
Now I know.

2623
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:15,560
It doesn't spawn more.

2624
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,080
Oh, thank God.

2625
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:18,940
Thank fucking God.

2626
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,900
Wait, there's another one.

2627
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:23,300
Oh, they were all there.

2628
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:29,460
I'm starting to question the authority of our Lord of Doors.

2629
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:32,420
Although it might be a bit late, given that I am deceased.

2630
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,840
The Lord of Doors?

2631
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:36,300
I thought it was just a witch.

2632
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,180
There's more?

2633
02:03:47,070 --> 02:03:49,170
God, I can't wait for more heals soon.

2634
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:51,050
I need more heals.

2635
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,350
Our children.

2636
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:55,450
Thank you.

2637
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:57,230
Oh, fuck.

2638
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:00,470
Oh, do you think she'll notice?

2639
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:01,510
Oh.

2640
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:12,810
That's true.

2641
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:14,310
I knew it!

2642
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:17,010
I knew they were related!

2643
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:20,470
I was like, why are there so many pots?

2644
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:22,630
Like, heads as pots.

2645
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:24,030
In the portraits.

2646
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:25,650
It's the one there.

2647
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:26,490
It's the grandson.

2648
02:04:26,830 --> 02:04:29,610
Filling that head of his with nonsense ideas about curses.

2649
02:04:30,090 --> 02:04:32,830
And then you come in here and smash up all my beautiful urns?

2650
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:34,970
I'm just trying to help people.

2651
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:38,390
If you set foot in my basement, there will be consequences.

2652
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:41,550
I might even have words with your employer.

2653
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:43,690
Oh my God, she's gonna go to my manager!

2654
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:46,710
Oh my God!

2655
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:47,310
No!

2656
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:48,970
Not my manager!

2657
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:52,210
I'd rather not see that old weirdo again.

2658
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:53,890
I mean, a lock for the head?

2659
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:55,470
So strange.

2660
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:57,290
Off with you, little crow!

2661
02:04:59,890 --> 02:05:01,010
Still slapping you, though.

2662
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:04,710
Still gonna slap.

2663
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:08,410
Alright, nice.

2664
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:10,710
Oh no, she's a Karen.

2665
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:13,630
She's a Karen all along!

2666
02:05:14,590 --> 02:05:15,530
What the fuck?

2667
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:18,170
I was like, where is he running to?

2668
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:22,190
This way.

2669
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:24,430
Down I go.

2670
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:28,310
Alright.

2671
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:31,290
Hello, grandson!

2672
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:31,610
Hello, son!

2673
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:47,110
Wait,

2674
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:58,390
where's your family?

2675
02:05:58,630 --> 02:05:59,350
Where's your dad?

2676
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:00,030
And your mom?

2677
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:03,570
You see, all...

2678
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:09,330
She was stricken with grief when my grandfather passed and made it her whole mission to keep her whole family alive forever.

2679
02:06:10,690 --> 02:06:16,050
Her research led her to believe that replacing one head with an urn would somehow strike you from death's ledger.

2680
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:21,110
However, I resisted, and during the struggle, her spell must have gone away.

2681
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:24,690
As far as you can see, I have a pot for a head.

2682
02:06:25,690 --> 02:06:31,910
I fear that she has gone too far beyond her years, and her soul has swollen and grown corrupted.

2683
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:34,530
I've seen it happen in this land many times.

2684
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:39,890
As a reaper, I implore you to end her suffering and bring her soul into the next life.

2685
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:43,270
Oh my god, he's asking me to kill her grandmother!

2686
02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:47,710
Oh no!

2687
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:49,070
I'm gonna slap her.

2688
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:55,210
Perhaps she can find peace once again.

2689
02:06:55,790 --> 02:06:57,850
He gave me permission to slap her, guys.

2690
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:58,410
It's okay.

2691
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:00,410
I got permission.

2692
02:07:01,510 --> 02:07:02,810
Be wary, living reaper.

2693
02:07:04,030 --> 02:07:06,110
But I ain't afraid of no ghost.

2694
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:09,770
Let's slap her to the afterlife.

2695
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:10,870
What the fuck?

2696
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:13,130
I'm back home.

2697
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:15,490
Wait, I don't think this is home, guys.

2698
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:18,470
Nevermind, I am not back.

2699
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:19,470
Oh wait, now I am.

2700
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:20,130
See?

2701
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:21,990
Wait, I don't think so.

2702
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:22,550
Nevermind.

2703
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:26,450
Alright.

2704
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:29,050
Time to open the chest.

2705
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:32,210
Wow.

2706
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,770
Wow.

2707
02:07:36,950 --> 02:07:38,090
Wow!

2708
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:42,990
Oh, it's a mimic.

2709
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,280
Aware race.

2710
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,680
What does that mean?

2711
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,200
Oh shit.

2712
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,340
I don't like that.

2713
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,340
Oh shit, I don't like that.

2714
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:01,420
Nice.

2715
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:04,280
Okay.

2716
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:07,040
There we go.

2717
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:08,860
I'll use these against you.

2718
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:11,740
That's right, send more in!

2719
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,420
Send- Oh fuck!

2720
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:18,340
Wait, but like in an evenly fashion though.

2721
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,960
There we go.

2722
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:28,140
Send them in in an evenly fashion!

2723
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,680
Oh fuck, okay.

2724
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:32,640
Oh fuck!

2725
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,100
I did it twice!

2726
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:35,440
Sorry.

2727
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:40,940
I got a little- I got a little confused for some reason.

2728
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,960
I don't know why.

2729
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:46,620
Okay.

2730
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:49,620
Where did he go?

2731
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:51,340
There you go.

2732
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,180
Where are they?

2733
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,460
Oh shit, there they are.

2734
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:59,060
Do I just blow them up?

2735
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:00,760
Oh, I do.

2736
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,180
Okay.

2737
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:12,220
Okay, that's fine.

2738
02:09:15,950 --> 02:09:16,550
Nice.

2739
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:19,570
I'm gonna use them against each other.

2740
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:22,170
Oh, I missed, but that's okay.

2741
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:25,330
Okay.

2742
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:27,030
No, not him.

2743
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:29,230
Not him.

2744
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:33,370
Okay.

2745
02:09:34,370 --> 02:09:37,150
I'm just gonna get rid of the smaller guys though.

2746
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:50,360
Okay,

2747
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:05,460
we try again.

2748
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:09,120
They swung around and around!

2749
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:11,440
Okay.

2750
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:13,960
Okay, I know how to fight this now.

2751
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,400
I know.

2752
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,460
I'm gonna start gaming guys, don't worry.

2753
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:23,240
But right now.

2754
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:24,260
Starting now.

2755
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:26,860
Starting now.

2756
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,660
Starting now, guys.

2757
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:35,760
Okay.

2758
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,360
Alright, okay, okay.

2759
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,260
Starting now.

2760
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:43,440
Starting now, guys.

2761
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:48,200
Jesus Christ.

2762
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:53,140
Oh my god, guys, stop.

2763
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:57,420
Okay, where's the...

2764
02:10:58,340 --> 02:10:59,400
Okay, nice.

2765
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,620
Where did this guy come from?

2766
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:04,320
What the fuck?

2767
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:09,550
Oh, fuck.

2768
02:11:15,170 --> 02:11:15,670
Okay.

2769
02:11:17,310 --> 02:11:18,510
Oh, no!

2770
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:21,010
I got too cocky.

2771
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:22,330
I got too cocky!

2772
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:23,170
I'm getting too cocky!

2773
02:11:23,490 --> 02:11:24,030
No!

2774
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:24,850
No!

2775
02:11:26,650 --> 02:11:29,690
I keep getting too cocky, guys.

2776
02:11:34,930 --> 02:11:37,110
Maybe they won't keep spawning.

2777
02:11:37,810 --> 02:11:38,510
Maybe.

2778
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:52,130
Okay.

2779
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:55,090
Okay.

2780
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:58,070
Alright, that's fine.

2781
02:11:59,170 --> 02:12:00,710
I can use this against them.

2782
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:09,340
Oh, they don't keep spawning!

2783
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:10,180
That's good!

2784
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,800
Wait, that's good!

2785
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,460
That's all I ever wanted!

2786
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:21,580
Okay.

2787
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,000
Okay, nice.

2788
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:28,120
Okay, nice.

2789
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:32,420
Nice!

2790
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:33,400
Okay, we did it!

2791
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:36,480
Alright, I know they don't keep spawning, okay.

2792
02:12:37,060 --> 02:12:39,700
I beat, like, every other time they kept spawning!

2793
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,080
As I'm supposed to know!

2794
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:45,300
It stops now?!

2795
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:46,940
Oh my God, King Crow?!

2796
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,440
Crow God!

2797
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:51,360
A gift to a fellow crow to aid you on your quest.

2798
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:54,960
Oh my God, Crow God, you're real?!

2799
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,120
I knew I wasn't praying to something!

2800
02:12:59,140 --> 02:12:59,740
Nothing?!

2801
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:01,700
Praise be to Crow God!

2802
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:05,660
Yippee!

2803
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,520
That's a big-ass crown for a tiny crow.

2804
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,560
Oh, I get flame spell?

2805
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,260
Wait, what?

2806
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:17,680
Oh, I don't have enough XP for that.

2807
02:13:17,940 --> 02:13:18,580
No XP.

2808
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:21,760
Crow Jesus!

2809
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:23,020
Bye bye!

2810
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:24,200
Thank you for the super chat!

2811
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,900
Thank you, Dark Birdy!

2812
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:28,340
Okay, now...

2813
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:29,900
Oh my God!

2814
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:33,140
I'm unstoppable!

2815
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:36,100
Gimme go!

2816
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:37,600
Wait, can I...

2817
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:38,440
Go there, then?

2818
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:40,820
Maybe I can roll over there?

2819
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:44,760
I'm so smart!

2820
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:48,440
But how do I get out?

2821
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:54,800
Now what do I do?

2822
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:58,820
Wait, how do I get out?

2823
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:03,080
Oh, there's under the stairs!

2824
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,140
Oh, there is!

2825
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:06,500
Wait, I made it harder for myself!

2826
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:09,440
Because I'm so smart!

2827
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:42,950
Quite strange, but it's above my pay grade.

2828
02:14:43,090 --> 02:14:45,130
I find it's better not to ask questions.

2829
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:49,530
Oh, one of the High Commissioner crows got bribed!

2830
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:52,130
They got bribed by the witch!

2831
02:14:54,430 --> 02:14:56,050
They closed it down!

2832
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,870
Someone's taking bribes now!

2833
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:04,170
Okay, we need to find a pot to farm our fucking heals.

2834
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:07,390
I just realized that I should've been farming my spells.

2835
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:09,310
There's a conspiracy out there.

2836
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:11,690
Release the documents.

2837
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:14,410
Release the witch files!

2838
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,480
Okay, I need to farm this.

2839
02:15:25,210 --> 02:15:26,570
Alright, there we go.

2840
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,990
A crow-spiracy!

2841
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:31,690
I'm here to crack the case!

2842
02:15:34,190 --> 02:15:34,930
Oh my god.

2843
02:15:35,290 --> 02:15:35,870
Oh my god.

2844
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:41,380
Call me, call me.

2845
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:43,720
Hello, crow.

2846
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:43,880
Hello, crow.

2847
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:49,240
I see you've been exploring the old office departments.

2848
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:52,280
I used to work over in the East section.

2849
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:56,680
Before I embraced my true life and quit the rat race, I'm much happier now.

2850
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:59,700
But that was one lovely, cozy office.

2851
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:00,920
Get out of here.

2852
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:02,120
What are you doing?

2853
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,980
Are you cheating on me, dragon?

2854
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:05,500
The fuck is this?

2855
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,800
What are you doing?

2856
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:07,740
Get out of here!

2857
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:08,300
Yeah!

2858
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:16,900
Oh my god, he's so cool.

2859
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,220
Seems like you're finding a wealth of souls out there.

2860
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,880
Where are they coming from?

2861
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:26,720
I haven't seen so much soul energy in decades, maybe centuries.

2862
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:30,160
Wait, what?

2863
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:33,260
Ceramic Manor?

2864
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:34,020
Oh!

2865
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:36,580
Oh, I'm back here!

2866
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:38,200
Wait, what the fuck?

2867
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,380
I'm back here.

2868
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:42,720
I guess I can upgrade.

2869
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:45,680
Yeah.

2870
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:47,080
Alright guys, what do we want?

2871
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:47,760
Guys.

2872
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:49,980
What do we want, chat?

2873
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,880
Wait, that's cheating?

2874
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:55,780
Yeah!

2875
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:58,440
I planted the seed!

2876
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:03,360
You still belong to me!

2877
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:04,800
I planted the seed!

2878
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:09,020
Alright, we'll get dexterity.

2879
02:17:17,130 --> 02:17:19,490
Okay, we should be going here.

2880
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:26,820
Oh, we're back here.

2881
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:28,000
Wait, what?

2882
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:30,700
Another one.

2883
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:32,420
Remember who planted the seed.

2884
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:38,720
I found it.

2885
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:41,240
I found the seeds.

2886
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:43,780
I don't know where they came from, but I planted it.

2887
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,280
Oh, there.

2888
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:46,860
Okay.

2889
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:49,520
This unlocks the basement.

2890
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,800
There we go.

2891
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,020
This must be where I killed the witch.

2892
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:05,460
That's right!

2893
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:06,520
I have custody!

2894
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:15,180
Alright, that must be to get my skillset back.

2895
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:18,760
Okay, down I go.

2896
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:21,340
Oh, shit.

2897
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:23,940
Oh, that's how it works.

2898
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:31,820
Gotta pick up more seeds.

2899
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:41,630
Where are we?

2900
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:42,630
Is this...

2901
02:18:42,630 --> 02:18:45,010
For an old witch, the fuck was she doing?

2902
02:18:47,670 --> 02:18:51,250
What was she fucking doing up down here?

2903
02:18:54,110 --> 02:18:55,490
What the fuck?

2904
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:00,560
What the fuck?

2905
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:03,360
Why is upstairs no go nowhere?

2906
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:11,540
Where does upstairs take me?

2907
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:13,040
Wait, that was like useless.

2908
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:14,580
There was nothing up here.

2909
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:24,130
Okay, there's clearly something over here.

2910
02:19:24,190 --> 02:19:26,310
I'm gonna put this cart all the way back here.

2911
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:28,450
Wait, no.

2912
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:29,070
I can't.

2913
02:19:29,110 --> 02:19:29,890
There's nothing here.

2914
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:33,630
I have to get another car.

2915
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:39,650
This is so different from like Crustate.

2916
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:46,170
Crustate like looked nothing like what I'm fucking experiencing right now.

2917
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:52,150
Like this is like a new area.

2918
02:19:58,870 --> 02:20:01,290
How do I open this though?

2919
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,940
Yeah, it doesn't go through the gate.

2920
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:12,080
Oh, it's right here.

2921
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:12,700
I see it.

2922
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,060
I didn't see the hole right here.

2923
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:16,380
Okay.

2924
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:18,820
There you go.

2925
02:20:19,140 --> 02:20:20,300
And it opens this.

2926
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:23,820
And it opens that here.

2927
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:30,960
Sorry.

2928
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:33,160
My bad.

2929
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:41,140
Oh my god.

2930
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:50,220
I'm like trying to do a drive-by for this stupid urn.

2931
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:52,780
Ah!

2932
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:04,000
I'm trying.

2933
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:06,500
I swear to god, I'm trying.

2934
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:14,490
I don't understand!

2935
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:22,090
Like, it goes too far.

2936
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:25,590
I can use a dagger?

2937
02:21:27,570 --> 02:21:30,130
Oh, the dagger does less.

2938
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:31,750
Oh my god, you guys are so smart.

2939
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:33,450
It doesn't work.

2940
02:21:33,450 --> 02:21:36,550
It still... it goes the same.

2941
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:37,710
It goes the same.

2942
02:21:41,490 --> 02:21:43,910
Oh my god, it's so hard to time it.

2943
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:47,550
Oh my god, this is actually so difficult to time.

2944
02:21:50,850 --> 02:21:51,410
Jesus.

2945
02:21:51,690 --> 02:21:52,470
Okay, we did it.

2946
02:21:53,190 --> 02:21:55,150
That was so difficult to time.

2947
02:21:55,350 --> 02:21:56,350
Oh my god.

2948
02:21:58,390 --> 02:22:00,410
Oh, what was it for?

2949
02:22:00,590 --> 02:22:01,910
This better give me 200.

2950
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:02,970
It gave me 100.

2951
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:04,890
That was all for 100 souls.

2952
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:05,270
Okay.

2953
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,780
Where am I?

2954
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:17,220
Hello?

2955
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:21,820
Is there any secret here?

2956
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:22,760
Secret?

2957
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:23,820
Secret?

2958
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:24,760
No secret.

2959
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:25,700
No secret.

2960
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:27,820
No secret.

2961
02:22:29,860 --> 02:22:30,460
Secret?

2962
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:30,800
Secret?

2963
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,200
No secret.

2964
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,160
I don't know if I'm going, like, main quest line or side quest line anymore.

2965
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:41,880
There's so many things here.

2966
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:44,240
Like, I can't tell.

2967
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,080
I'm so lost.

2968
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,520
Are we main quest line or side quest line?

2969
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:50,440
Where am I?

2970
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:52,600
Is this main?

2971
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:54,920
No, like the pathway I went to.

2972
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:57,200
Cause I didn't go a different pathway.

2973
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:01,560
I went through so many different areas.

2974
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:02,580
Oh, there's another seed.

2975
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:06,740
Oh, I am?

2976
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:09,400
Oh, that means the other way was the side.

2977
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:13,760
Cause I went a different- there was another way too.

2978
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:16,500
Wait, there's a shrine.

2979
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:17,380
I wanna pray.

2980
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:19,040
Let me pray.

2981
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,660
How do I pray to you?

2982
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:25,220
Wait, I wanna pray to the crow gods.

2983
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:28,060
Oh, there's their son.

2984
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:30,980
Hello.

2985
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:37,870
I warned you, crow.

2986
02:23:38,830 --> 02:23:40,170
Yet still you persevere.

2987
02:23:40,730 --> 02:23:43,230
I'm not quite sure if that's admirable or stupid.

2988
02:23:44,350 --> 02:23:46,690
No, it's definitely stupid.

2989
02:23:47,630 --> 02:23:53,790
Now if you'll excuse me, I must have some alone time with some infuriating young lad here.

2990
02:23:56,850 --> 02:23:59,110
Hopefully, I can make him see sense.

2991
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:03,050
Now please, go away.

2992
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:05,910
Woo, disappear.

2993
02:24:08,270 --> 02:24:08,950
Alright.

2994
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:11,610
Kamehameha.

2995
02:24:12,830 --> 02:24:13,950
Alright, open the door.

2996
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:16,630
Now this granny's techy as hell.

2997
02:24:18,010 --> 02:24:22,230
Oh fuck, she built an undergrad factory down here.

2998
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:25,430
I did not expect that.

2999
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:30,790
Now I'm in the furnace?

3000
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:33,290
Where the fuck am I?

3001
02:24:33,390 --> 02:24:34,470
I'm gonna reset my HP.

3002
02:24:39,290 --> 02:24:40,730
The fuck?

3003
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,680
Oh my god, where am I?

3004
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:54,660
I'm gonna grab some kamihas real quick.

3005
02:24:57,320 --> 02:24:58,700
Oh, fire.

3006
02:25:00,260 --> 02:25:00,980
Fire.

3007
02:25:00,980 --> 02:25:01,140
Okay.

3008
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:03,060
What?

3009
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:04,000
Oh.

3010
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:05,240
Oh my god!

3011
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:09,900
Now it's- What are you- What the fuck is that?

3012
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:13,880
What the fuck?

3013
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:16,360
What are you?

3014
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:22,260
At least it travels through, that's good too.

3015
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:23,500
Okay.

3016
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:25,580
Now it's steampunk?

3017
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:29,900
I'm so confused.

3018
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:32,680
We're steampunking, I guess?

3019
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:37,120
From potheads to steampunk?

3020
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:42,850
Alright.

3021
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:45,750
Get out of here.

3022
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:49,730
I know you can't do shit when you can't spin.

3023
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:52,210
What can you do when you can't spin?

3024
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:54,450
Oh my god!

3025
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:00,480
Oh fuck, guys, I don't think I can dodge that.

3026
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:03,920
Okay.

3027
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:05,380
Oh shit!

3028
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:06,940
Shit.

3029
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:10,780
I got confused, guys.

3030
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,480
I got confused.

3031
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:14,520
My bad.

3032
02:26:19,910 --> 02:26:20,670
Okay.

3033
02:26:21,270 --> 02:26:22,290
Oh fuck!

3034
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:26,030
Oh my god!

3035
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:27,210
Give me a sec!

3036
02:26:28,250 --> 02:26:30,970
A lot of things are going on, I gotta plant my seed!

3037
02:26:33,310 --> 02:26:34,070
Okay.

3038
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:38,520
Alright.

3039
02:26:41,820 --> 02:26:42,120
Oh!

3040
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:45,600
Okay, nice, I got him.

3041
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:47,200
Alright.

3042
02:26:48,180 --> 02:26:50,520
I'm gonna take this real fast.

3043
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:52,460
Get over here.

3044
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,580
Get your ass over here.

3045
02:26:53,940 --> 02:26:55,020
Get your- Oh fuck!

3046
02:26:55,700 --> 02:26:56,920
Wait, you can fight back?

3047
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:00,480
Wait, what?

3048
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:03,080
Oh, okay, now he's dead.

3049
02:27:03,560 --> 02:27:04,200
For real.

3050
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:06,340
Okay, nice.

3051
02:27:10,130 --> 02:27:10,650
Okay.

3052
02:27:11,810 --> 02:27:12,330
Kamehameha!

3053
02:27:13,270 --> 02:27:13,830
Kamehameha!

3054
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:16,130
Oh.

3055
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:18,490
Let me through.

3056
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:20,550
Let me through.

3057
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:27,350
Okay.

3058
02:27:27,610 --> 02:27:30,790
I don't know how the little blob's gonna try and kill me though.

3059
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:31,410
No!

3060
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:32,210
Okay.

3061
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:33,470
That's my bad.

3062
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:35,150
I got a little too cocky there.

3063
02:27:36,130 --> 02:27:38,770
I wanted to do the extra little damage.

3064
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:41,410
That was not worth it at all.

3065
02:27:42,310 --> 02:27:43,070
Oh.

3066
02:27:44,010 --> 02:27:45,110
Go up.

3067
02:27:46,390 --> 02:27:47,030
Seed time!

3068
02:27:47,790 --> 02:27:50,370
I'm running out of seeds though.

3069
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:53,330
Guys, I'm getting tired.

3070
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:56,230
I'm actually tired.

3071
02:27:57,870 --> 02:28:04,150
I'm like the Mr. Fantastic meme right now, guys.

3072
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:04,670
Too many.

3073
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:14,330
Too many.

3074
02:28:15,150 --> 02:28:15,950
Wait, how do I...

3075
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:19,950
I wonder...

3076
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:20,770
Oh, nice.

3077
02:28:20,910 --> 02:28:21,130
Okay.

3078
02:28:24,310 --> 02:28:25,230
Okay, nice.

3079
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:25,570
Secret!

3080
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:28,170
Yeah!

3081
02:28:28,390 --> 02:28:28,790
Secret!

3082
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:30,290
That's right.

3083
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:31,970
You aren't taking custody!

3084
02:28:34,270 --> 02:28:36,250
My children now!

3085
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:44,220
Okay.

3086
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:45,120
Oh, here.

3087
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,960
Yeah, this way.

3088
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:53,800
Have I been...

3089
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:54,600
Oh yeah, I've been here.

3090
02:28:58,100 --> 02:28:59,960
Okay, just resetting that.

3091
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:04,840
Oh my god, he's big!

3092
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:06,340
Big boy!

3093
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:11,320
Okay, and then they become little mini boys.

3094
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,600
Oh, fuck!

3095
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:15,420
Okay, I need to not get greedy.

3096
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,540
Sometimes I get way too greedy.

3097
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:19,320
I can't help it.

3098
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:22,300
I just want to slap them.

3099
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:24,860
Oh, the little guys can do it too!

3100
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:28,860
They just don't live long enough to do it.

3101
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:30,080
Okay, now I know that.

3102
02:29:35,050 --> 02:29:37,110
Okay, I'm just gonna kill you.

3103
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:39,090
So you don't make more.

3104
02:29:41,050 --> 02:29:41,530
Alright.

3105
02:29:42,110 --> 02:29:43,430
Over here I go.

3106
02:29:44,270 --> 02:29:45,130
Oh no.

3107
02:29:45,130 --> 02:29:46,010
Oh, thank god.

3108
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:47,210
Thank god he's special.

3109
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:50,810
Okay.

3110
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:52,910
Get out of here.

3111
02:29:53,770 --> 02:29:54,890
Do I need secrets?

3112
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:55,670
No secret.

3113
02:29:58,770 --> 02:29:59,870
Oh shit.

3114
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:01,830
Okay, that was a little too close.

3115
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:05,270
Pew!

3116
02:30:06,490 --> 02:30:07,830
Get out of here.

3117
02:30:08,290 --> 02:30:09,550
Get out of here!

3118
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:11,310
Get your ass out of here!

3119
02:30:12,610 --> 02:30:14,770
You use arrows against fire?

3120
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:17,090
You are stupid.

3121
02:30:18,330 --> 02:30:18,590
Okay.

3122
02:30:18,730 --> 02:30:19,610
Oh my god.

3123
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:20,350
No, I got...

3124
02:30:20,350 --> 02:30:20,930
Oh, thank god.

3125
02:30:21,030 --> 02:30:21,690
I didn't get stuck there.

3126
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:24,350
Oh, I was worried I was gonna get stuck.

3127
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:27,090
Okay.

3128
02:30:27,710 --> 02:30:28,250
Oh.

3129
02:30:29,210 --> 02:30:30,690
So many blobs.

3130
02:30:34,310 --> 02:30:34,850
Okay.

3131
02:30:37,870 --> 02:30:38,410
Nice.

3132
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:42,470
Okay.

3133
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:46,470
Jesus.

3134
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:49,460
I'm trying not to be...

3135
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:50,140
Guys, look!

3136
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:51,820
I'm not being greedy, guys!

3137
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:55,560
I'm actually basing myself!

3138
02:30:57,100 --> 02:30:58,040
No more green!

3139
02:30:58,260 --> 02:30:59,120
I do learn!

3140
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:01,160
Alright.

3141
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:02,260
I learn.

3142
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:06,180
Okay.

3143
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:06,960
Roll.

3144
02:31:10,580 --> 02:31:10,930
Roll.

3145
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:14,060
Oh, look at these little bi- Oh, shit.

3146
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:14,880
He's a big boy.

3147
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:15,600
Oh, shit.

3148
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:16,340
Oh, fuck.

3149
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:18,640
No!

3150
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:27,520
See?

3151
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:31,740
There's so many things on my screen!

3152
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:34,780
I wasn't greedy!

3153
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:37,300
I was- It's just smoke!

3154
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,920
Like, what the fuck was I supposed to do?

3155
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,540
There's literally just smoke!

3156
02:31:53,620 --> 02:31:54,180
Okay.

3157
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:57,080
Okay.

3158
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,000
I'm not gonna be greedy.

3159
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:00,180
Don't be greedy, Doki.

3160
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,200
Don't be greedy!

3161
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:03,820
Oh, fuck.

3162
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:04,080
Okay.

3163
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:05,120
I wasn't greedy.

3164
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:07,260
Alright.

3165
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:12,820
Big guy becomes small guy.

3166
02:32:13,340 --> 02:32:14,460
Are you serious?

3167
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:15,400
Okay.

3168
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:17,180
That's bullshit.

3169
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:19,060
That- Okay.

3170
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:21,240
Okay, you gotta admit.

3171
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:23,560
That one was- That one was bullshit.

3172
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:25,860
That one- That one was bullshit.

3173
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:27,640
There's no way.

3174
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:28,220
Jellyfish!

3175
02:32:28,300 --> 02:32:30,240
Thank you for the- Welcome to Tomato Farm!

3176
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:31,200
Welcome, welcome!

3177
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:34,660
That shouldn't have killed me.

3178
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:36,820
That should not have killed me right there.

3179
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:41,420
Okay.

3180
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:42,040
Nice.

3181
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:47,820
Jesus Christ.

3182
02:32:54,500 --> 02:32:55,540
Fuck you.

3183
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:56,840
Oh, my god.

3184
02:32:56,840 --> 02:32:57,380
Fuck you.

3185
02:32:58,440 --> 02:32:59,400
Oh, my god.

3186
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:00,060
I'm coming over.

3187
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:01,660
I'm coming over.

3188
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:02,420
I'm coming over.

3189
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:03,460
I'm fucking coming over.

3190
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:04,160
I'm gonna slap you.

3191
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:05,600
I'm gonna slap you.

3192
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:07,400
I'm coming over.

3193
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,360
Ah, shit!

3194
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:10,420
You stupid arrow!

3195
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:12,720
Taking custody of this child, too.

3196
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:23,820
Guys, I should not have taken- I should have left that child alone.

3197
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:27,240
I should have- Okay.

3198
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:29,360
Okay, that was my bad.

3199
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:30,940
I will admit.

3200
02:33:30,940 --> 02:33:33,320
That was absolutely my bad.

3201
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:37,660
I should not have done that.

3202
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:38,800
Now I know.

3203
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:40,200
No!

3204
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:42,900
I'm being greedy!

3205
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:47,360
Child had body.

3206
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:49,260
Oh, my god.

3207
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:50,620
I'm being greedy now.

3208
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:55,100
Okay.

3209
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:55,880
There we go.

3210
02:33:58,740 --> 02:33:59,580
Alright.

3211
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:00,240
Oh, shit.

3212
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:01,940
Okay.

3213
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:04,740
Okay, that guy just ran off.

3214
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:10,960
I - Lord Kuro says, Thank you for the super chat.

3215
02:34:11,060 --> 02:34:11,280
Thank you.

3216
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:12,160
Thank you.

3217
02:34:12,760 --> 02:34:13,460
Hey, Toki.

3218
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:14,820
Tomorrow is John Mita's birthday.

3219
02:34:14,980 --> 02:34:16,560
Can we get an early happy- Of course!

3220
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:17,920
Happy- God!

3221
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,460
Happy birthday to you.

3222
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:21,220
Happy birthday to you.

3223
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:23,240
Happy birthday, dear John.

3224
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:24,960
Happy birthday to you.

3225
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:26,380
Okay, poor little guy.

3226
02:34:27,220 --> 02:34:29,260
He really wanted me to dead.

3227
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:32,680
I'm gonna put it on strength next.

3228
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:33,980
The moment I get enough.

3229
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:35,380
Fuck this.

3230
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,600
Oh, my god!

3231
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:47,500
I hate how there's- The iframes is like- It's so hard to do the iframes in this game.

3232
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:51,200
This one is difficult for iframes, I feel like.

3233
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:54,420
Okay.

3234
02:34:54,420 --> 02:34:56,300
I think it's definitely a lot harder.

3235
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:58,220
Oh, my god.

3236
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:00,060
Kamehameha you.

3237
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,200
What hit me?!

3238
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:04,960
You!

3239
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:09,020
You!

3240
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:25,930
I went into the poison.

3241
02:35:26,970 --> 02:35:31,830
I hate that enemy so much!

3242
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:34,670
It CC's me.

3243
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:36,890
That's a deadpull.

3244
02:35:37,610 --> 02:35:39,830
Thank you for the magenta super.

3245
02:35:40,610 --> 02:35:43,750
Thank you, thank- There's so many birthdays I told you guys!

3246
02:35:45,050 --> 02:35:47,290
Something happened nine months ago.

3247
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:52,570
There must have been a big party.

3248
02:35:53,550 --> 02:35:54,610
That's a deadpull.

3249
02:35:54,770 --> 02:35:55,950
Thank you for the magenta super.

3250
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:57,150
Thank you, thank you.

3251
02:35:58,430 --> 02:35:59,510
Hey, Adoki.

3252
02:35:59,710 --> 02:36:01,590
I've just been informed it's John's birthday.

3253
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:02,870
Can you get a happy birthday, please?

3254
02:36:02,990 --> 02:36:03,590
Of course!

3255
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:05,570
Happy birthday to you.

3256
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:08,010
Happy birthday to you.

3257
02:36:08,290 --> 02:36:10,730
Happy birthday, dear John!

3258
02:36:11,290 --> 02:36:11,730
Sorry.

3259
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:14,970
Happy birthday- I'm fucking- I'm just gonna die.

3260
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:17,350
Just end this.

3261
02:36:17,610 --> 02:36:18,410
Actually, no.

3262
02:36:18,470 --> 02:36:19,630
I don't want to see the defeat side.

3263
02:36:19,730 --> 02:36:20,510
I'm just gonna reset.

3264
02:36:21,310 --> 02:36:23,150
A birthday to you!

3265
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:23,630
No!

3266
02:36:25,090 --> 02:36:25,570
Okay.

3267
02:36:26,630 --> 02:36:27,550
Let me...

3268
02:36:27,550 --> 02:36:31,370
Let me reset this run.

3269
02:36:31,930 --> 02:36:33,050
Wait, do I have enough?

3270
02:36:33,410 --> 02:36:34,330
I have enough.

3271
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:35,450
I'm fucking buying strength.

3272
02:36:35,570 --> 02:36:36,250
Fuck this shit.

3273
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:38,550
I'm gonna beat up some fucking goos.

3274
02:36:41,490 --> 02:36:42,290
Me mad.

3275
02:36:43,830 --> 02:36:44,670
Me mad.

3276
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:45,810
Me going- Me strong.

3277
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:48,150
Me be big, strong bird.

3278
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:52,190
Alright.

3279
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,460
I'm a strong bird now.

3280
02:36:58,700 --> 02:36:59,600
I could run through it.

3281
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:00,220
Wait, can I?

3282
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:02,000
Let's try.

3283
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:03,660
I run through.

3284
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:06,180
I'm gonna run through.

3285
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:09,520
Oh my god, I forgot I unlocked this area.

3286
02:37:09,740 --> 02:37:11,520
Oh my god, I'm so fucking stupid.

3287
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,180
It's so sad.

3288
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:32,580
I'm just gonna kill these guys though.

3289
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:34,120
These guys are very annoying.

3290
02:37:37,220 --> 02:37:40,120
These guys are very fucking annoying.

3291
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:48,360
Oh, fuck.

3292
02:37:48,440 --> 02:37:48,580
Okay.

3293
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:51,120
I just want to kill him.

3294
02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:53,460
For all the suffering he's giving me.

3295
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:57,020
And then you get the fire.

3296
02:37:57,620 --> 02:37:58,700
You get the fucking fire.

3297
02:38:00,280 --> 02:38:01,580
Okay, we did it.

3298
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:02,480
We did it.

3299
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:03,580
We just ran past.

3300
02:38:03,660 --> 02:38:04,220
We did it.

3301
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:07,400
Oh my god, we fucking did it.

3302
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:09,680
Oh my god.

3303
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:12,500
I should've been running in the first place.

3304
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:14,560
I don't know why.

3305
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:16,160
I just got really cocky.

3306
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:17,900
For some reason.

3307
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,680
Wish I could kill him before he starts rolling, right?

3308
02:38:23,820 --> 02:38:23,960
Yeah.

3309
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:25,280
Oh, I just...

3310
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:25,580
No!

3311
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:27,640
My shield!

3312
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,560
That's fucking right.

3313
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:31,280
See you, dad.

3314
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:38,990
Okay, goodbye.

3315
02:38:42,110 --> 02:38:43,050
Nice try.

3316
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,170
Nice try.

3317
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:47,470
Oh, shit!

3318
02:38:47,990 --> 02:38:49,070
Where did he come from?

3319
02:38:49,170 --> 02:38:50,250
What the fuck?

3320
02:38:52,330 --> 02:38:52,930
Okay.

3321
02:38:52,930 --> 02:38:53,330
Okay.

3322
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:56,430
I got custody of my children again.

3323
02:38:57,010 --> 02:38:57,450
Alright.

3324
02:38:58,190 --> 02:38:58,950
Get over here.

3325
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,220
Okay.

3326
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:09,000
Oh, does it like keep spitting?

3327
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:10,140
If I just...

3328
02:39:10,140 --> 02:39:10,700
Oh!

3329
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:11,970
I see.

3330
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:14,400
So like...

3331
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:15,380
He keeps spitting.

3332
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:15,800
I don't know.

3333
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:16,380
Cause I didn't...

3334
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:17,920
I just killed his jar for him.

3335
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,600
Wait, I feel like there's something down here.

3336
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:23,620
Guys, there's nothing down there.

3337
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,840
It was glowing!

3338
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,300
Guys, it was glowing.

3339
02:39:34,820 --> 02:39:35,440
Okay.

3340
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:39,440
It was glowing.

3341
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:42,080
I thought there would be something.

3342
02:39:43,290 --> 02:39:44,460
It was glowing.

3343
02:39:46,380 --> 02:39:47,320
Okay.

3344
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:48,700
It glowed.

3345
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:54,500
It glowed, so I assumed there was something.

3346
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:03,040
Okay, nice.

3347
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:04,580
I got him out of the way.

3348
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:09,100
I'm just gonna kill him before he shoots that arrow.

3349
02:40:13,130 --> 02:40:14,410
Alright, we made it there.

3350
02:40:15,070 --> 02:40:17,370
We made it here wherever we are.

3351
02:40:19,490 --> 02:40:20,530
Where are we?

3352
02:40:22,330 --> 02:40:23,810
Wait, this might be a secret!

3353
02:40:29,220 --> 02:40:30,580
Maybe I can light it here.

3354
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:33,360
Wait, why did it let me go here?

3355
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:34,960
It's not a secret, guys.

3356
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:37,280
Fucking lied to me.

3357
02:40:40,470 --> 02:40:41,450
What is it doing?

3358
02:40:41,950 --> 02:40:42,710
Oh, shit!

3359
02:40:43,990 --> 02:40:44,510
Fucker.

3360
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:45,710
Oh, shit!

3361
02:40:45,890 --> 02:40:46,470
Oh, my god.

3362
02:40:46,570 --> 02:40:47,030
Fuck, okay.

3363
02:40:52,990 --> 02:40:54,030
Oh, fuck!

3364
02:40:54,590 --> 02:40:54,970
Wait!

3365
02:40:55,430 --> 02:40:56,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

3366
02:40:56,850 --> 02:40:57,150
Wait!

3367
02:40:57,630 --> 02:40:58,730
Wait, I don't...

3368
02:40:58,730 --> 02:40:58,990
No!

3369
02:41:00,290 --> 02:41:00,810
Shortcut!

3370
02:41:01,730 --> 02:41:02,250
Purpose!

3371
02:41:02,850 --> 02:41:04,330
Guys, I did that on purpose!

3372
02:41:05,010 --> 02:41:05,510
Guys!

3373
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:08,450
Guys, I did that on purpose, guys.

3374
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:09,750
So I can...

3375
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:10,550
So I can...

3376
02:41:10,550 --> 02:41:11,610
Guys, it was a...

3377
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:12,410
It was a shortcut.

3378
02:41:12,690 --> 02:41:13,250
It was a skip.

3379
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:15,410
It was a skip.

3380
02:41:16,370 --> 02:41:16,850
Guys.

3381
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:19,330
Okay, there you go.

3382
02:41:20,030 --> 02:41:20,850
Just as planned.

3383
02:41:23,770 --> 02:41:25,010
Tactical skip, guys.

3384
02:41:26,350 --> 02:41:27,230
Oh, my god.

3385
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:28,870
I hate this fucker so much.

3386
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:33,350
Tactical skip, guys.

3387
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:34,250
Tactical skip.

3388
02:41:34,250 --> 02:41:36,230
I would've wasted time if I didn't do that.

3389
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:41,200
What the fuck is he doing?

3390
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:43,260
Okay.

3391
02:41:43,380 --> 02:41:44,000
Oh, child.

3392
02:41:48,490 --> 02:41:50,390
What the fuck were you doing, bro?

3393
02:41:51,610 --> 02:41:53,610
Okay, let's see if there's anything there.

3394
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:54,610
Hello, Mexican!

3395
02:41:54,970 --> 02:41:56,890
Thank you for the super chat!

3396
02:41:57,010 --> 02:41:57,190
Thank you!

3397
02:41:57,570 --> 02:41:57,910
Thank you!

3398
02:41:58,150 --> 02:41:58,430
God!

3399
02:41:59,830 --> 02:42:02,330
By the way, I have a friend named HelmetIsTrash.

3400
02:42:03,010 --> 02:42:03,970
And it's his birthday today.

3401
02:42:04,050 --> 02:42:04,850
Can you wish him a...

3402
02:42:04,850 --> 02:42:05,050
Okay.

3403
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:07,470
For some reason, I feel like...

3404
02:42:08,330 --> 02:42:10,930
One of you guys are lying about a birthday.

3405
02:42:11,330 --> 02:42:12,170
I don't know.

3406
02:42:14,870 --> 02:42:20,210
I feel like some of you guys might be lying about birthdays now.

3407
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:24,670
Happy birthday to you.

3408
02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:27,330
Happy birthday to you.

3409
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:29,430
Happy birthday to...

3410
02:42:29,430 --> 02:42:30,270
Oh, fucking hell.

3411
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:31,010
I didn't even see you.

3412
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:31,930
Happy...

3413
02:42:31,930 --> 02:42:32,770
To...

3414
02:42:32,770 --> 02:42:33,010
Sorry.

3415
02:42:33,970 --> 02:42:34,350
To...

3416
02:42:34,350 --> 02:42:34,970
Helmet.

3417
02:42:35,650 --> 02:42:35,890
Sorry.

3418
02:42:36,530 --> 02:42:39,010
Happy birthday to you.

3419
02:42:39,110 --> 02:42:39,590
God!

3420
02:42:42,370 --> 02:42:42,850
Okay,

3421
02:42:47,530 --> 02:42:48,290
there we go.

3422
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:51,830
Alright, I'm gonna reset and grab my HP.

3423
02:42:54,410 --> 02:42:54,890
James!

3424
02:42:55,330 --> 02:42:56,310
Thank you for the super chat!

3425
02:42:56,410 --> 02:42:56,630
Thank you!

3426
02:42:56,850 --> 02:42:57,450
Thank you!

3427
02:42:57,570 --> 02:42:58,190
Hey, Doki.

3428
02:42:58,330 --> 02:43:00,430
Tomorrow is my buddy John's birthday.

3429
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:02,330
Can you wish him an early birthday, too?

3430
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:03,450
Of course I can!

3431
02:43:03,470 --> 02:43:05,790
If he's real or not, I'll never know!

3432
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:07,030
God!

3433
02:43:07,030 --> 02:43:08,970
Happy birthday to you!

3434
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:10,910
Happy birthday to you!

3435
02:43:11,250 --> 02:43:13,010
Happy birthday, dear John!

3436
02:43:13,650 --> 02:43:15,310
Happy birthday to you!

3437
02:43:15,530 --> 02:43:15,830
God!

3438
02:43:16,650 --> 02:43:17,530
Happy birthday!

3439
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:19,370
Okay, C-Tab.

3440
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:26,520
Okay.

3441
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:30,380
I'm just gonna kill them just for the sake of...

3442
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,940
Just for the sake of, like, an extra...

3443
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,340
I mean, it's like plus one.

3444
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:37,520
It's actually not that much.

3445
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:38,480
I feel like it's not...

3446
02:43:38,480 --> 02:43:40,100
Actually, it's not worth it, I feel.

3447
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:42,640
Yeah, it's not worth it.

3448
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:45,640
To try and...

3449
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:47,680
Grab stuff.

3450
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:49,920
Oh, wait, what?

3451
02:43:50,460 --> 02:43:51,460
Oh, it's this way.

3452
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:54,620
Yeah, definitely not worth it.

3453
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:56,180
I'll just kill them now.

3454
02:43:56,300 --> 02:43:57,620
Just get rid of that one guy.

3455
02:43:58,060 --> 02:43:59,500
Fuck that one slime in particular!

3456
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:00,320
Fuck that guy!

3457
02:44:00,980 --> 02:44:02,080
His life don't matter!

3458
02:44:03,400 --> 02:44:04,420
Now, fuck you, too!

3459
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:05,920
That's right!

3460
02:44:06,140 --> 02:44:06,940
I said it!

3461
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:07,680
Get over here!

3462
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:08,900
I'm charging my sword!

3463
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:11,960
Boom!

3464
02:44:15,060 --> 02:44:17,020
Oh shit, I'm fucking getting cocky now.

3465
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:22,020
I always randomly get cocky.

3466
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:25,820
Get over here.

3467
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:26,200
Get closer.

3468
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:26,980
That's right!

3469
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:29,460
Where's the other...

3470
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:30,900
Oh, it's Furnace over here.

3471
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:33,280
Okay, I'm trying to figure out where the other...

3472
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:35,300
Furnace is.

3473
02:44:38,660 --> 02:44:39,260
Okay.

3474
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:41,840
It's not worth it, though.

3475
02:44:41,860 --> 02:44:42,400
I don't know.

3476
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:44,700
I don't know if it's even worth it to kill these enemies.

3477
02:44:45,780 --> 02:44:46,180
Jesus.

3478
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:50,560
Boom!

3479
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:55,000
Cause, like, I'm getting, like, plus one, plus two.

3480
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:56,780
So little.

3481
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:59,560
So little heal...

3482
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:01,220
Like, so little upgrade points.

3483
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:05,700
Yeah, they don't give a lot of soul.

3484
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:06,460
Oh, fuck!

3485
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:06,720
Okay.

3486
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:08,680
I killed him before he used his attack.

3487
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:11,760
Like, I don't know.

3488
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:15,280
They give, like, so little, so...

3489
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:17,820
I'll just kill them because they're, like, in the way.

3490
02:45:18,220 --> 02:45:18,820
I guess.

3491
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:22,360
Okay.

3492
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:25,280
Be gone!

3493
02:45:26,500 --> 02:45:27,480
Be gone!

3494
02:45:28,220 --> 02:45:28,980
And then...

3495
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:29,340
Fire!

3496
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:30,680
Oh my god.

3497
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:31,380
Combo.

3498
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:33,100
Oh!

3499
02:45:33,480 --> 02:45:37,400
I think if I had the range upgrade, I would've one-shot all of them.

3500
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:38,440
For sure.

3501
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:42,600
A chat.

3502
02:45:42,780 --> 02:45:43,500
Thank you for the super chat.

3503
02:45:43,580 --> 02:45:44,340
Thank you, thank you.

3504
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:44,960
Hey, Doki.

3505
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:45,400
It's...

3506
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:45,660
Oh, wait.

3507
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:46,880
Wait.

3508
02:45:46,980 --> 02:45:47,380
Oh, shit.

3509
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:49,460
Okay.

3510
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:51,660
I'll get him out first.

3511
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:52,880
Oh, yeah.

3512
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:53,860
Thank you for the super chat.

3513
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:54,460
Thank you.

3514
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:56,160
Thank you for the super chat.

3515
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:56,500
Thank you.

3516
02:45:56,680 --> 02:45:57,040
Thank...

3517
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:57,660
Oh, shit.

3518
02:45:58,520 --> 02:45:58,820
No!

3519
02:46:00,820 --> 02:46:01,620
Oh, fuck!

3520
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:02,460
Okay, give me a sec.

3521
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:05,800
Seed.

3522
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:06,940
Okay.

3523
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:09,580
Drive by.

3524
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:12,840
Drive by.

3525
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:13,720
Okay, there we go.

3526
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:14,900
I did it.

3527
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:15,860
I got the drive by.

3528
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:17,600
There we go.

3529
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:19,720
Medi!

3530
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:20,680
Thank you for the super chat.

3531
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:21,260
Thank you.

3532
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:21,700
Thank you.

3533
02:46:23,660 --> 02:46:24,840
Oh, it's right here.

3534
02:46:25,380 --> 02:46:25,780
Hey, Doki.

3535
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:28,520
I didn't send birthday super chat last year, so can I cash it in now?

3536
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:29,380
You missed out.

3537
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:30,700
No.

3538
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:32,420
It has...

3539
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:32,860
It's like...

3540
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:33,860
It's a 30-day.

3541
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:35,440
You missed a deadline.

3542
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:39,900
You can only cash in birthday super chats if it's within 30 days of your birthday.

3543
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:42,740
Just like taxes.

3544
02:46:47,380 --> 02:46:47,780
Star!

3545
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:49,000
Thank you for the super chat.

3546
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:49,280
Thank you.

3547
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:49,820
Thank you.

3548
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:50,720
Hi, Doki.

3549
02:46:50,880 --> 02:46:52,580
It's my pet rock's birthday today.

3550
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:53,740
Yeah, what's his name?

3551
02:46:53,860 --> 02:46:55,240
I kinda wish him a happy birthday.

3552
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:57,540
If I don't know his name.

3553
02:46:57,740 --> 02:46:58,520
Thank you for the super chat.

3554
02:46:58,600 --> 02:46:58,780
Thank you.

3555
02:46:58,860 --> 02:46:59,480
Thank you.

3556
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:00,160
Gah!

3557
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:01,900
Oh, there she is.

3558
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:06,260
You little shit.

3559
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:09,680
Crows never do what they're told.

3560
02:47:10,620 --> 02:47:12,680
I am trying to save lives here.

3561
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:14,160
Don't you understand?

3562
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:17,860
Death cannot see those who have mastered life force within and earn.

3563
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:20,940
I can fool the grim reaper himself.

3564
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:27,910
You and I have something a little common, crow.

3565
02:47:29,190 --> 02:47:30,330
The same employer.

3566
02:47:31,270 --> 02:47:34,090
But goodness, we can't have them fighting about everything you've seen.

3567
02:47:34,970 --> 02:47:35,930
Don't worry.

3568
02:47:36,370 --> 02:47:37,290
I'll put Jemma's...

3569
02:47:37,290 --> 02:47:38,590
Wait, I didn't read the last part.

3570
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:39,390
What did she say?

3571
02:47:39,390 --> 02:47:43,050
Oh my god, she's a magic user fucking witch.

3572
02:47:44,190 --> 02:47:46,150
Never trust magic users.

3573
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:49,050
Pew!

3574
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:50,330
Pew!

3575
02:47:50,630 --> 02:47:51,510
What is she using?

3576
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:53,610
Pew!

3577
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:56,030
I say as I throw my fire at her.

3578
02:47:59,050 --> 02:48:01,690
Never trust magic users.

3579
02:48:02,890 --> 02:48:03,930
There we go.

3580
02:48:06,830 --> 02:48:08,090
That's not fair.

3581
02:48:09,870 --> 02:48:11,010
Wait, what?

3582
02:48:12,010 --> 02:48:13,110
What the fuck?

3583
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:16,810
What the fuck?!

3584
02:48:22,270 --> 02:48:23,010
What?!

3585
02:48:24,130 --> 02:48:27,050
Oh my god, how did it become Toho?!

3586
02:48:31,470 --> 02:48:35,690
What do you mean this isn't Toho?!

3587
02:48:37,060 --> 02:48:38,220
Okay.

3588
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:39,220
Okay.

3589
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:45,340
I guess I never escape Toho.

3590
02:48:47,140 --> 02:48:48,160
Okay, nice.

3591
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:50,880
It always was.

3592
02:48:53,500 --> 02:48:57,840
I don't know if my fireball does anything when she's in paw form.

3593
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:00,040
You think it does anything?

3594
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:01,060
I can't tell.

3595
02:49:01,140 --> 02:49:02,580
I feel like I might get squished.

3596
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:05,180
Oh no, not Toho.

3597
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:08,400
Oh, I can just stand right here.

3598
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:13,040
Oh, it's not that bad.

3599
02:49:16,820 --> 02:49:17,760
Oh shit.

3600
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:19,920
Okay.

3601
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:23,500
Thank god, I can just stand right there.

3602
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:35,120
Oh my god, this is so frustrating.

3603
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:37,980
I can't get near enough.

3604
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:41,920
I can't get near enough to use my actual sword.

3605
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:44,320
Because I'm pretty sure that does nothing.

3606
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:46,520
Alright, Toho time.

3607
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:51,240
Stand right here.

3608
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:00,460
Oh shit.

3609
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:05,220
Oh, that's a lot.

3610
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,920
Oh my god!

3611
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:09,320
She used it against me.

3612
02:50:14,710 --> 02:50:15,570
Here we go.

3613
02:50:16,330 --> 02:50:17,570
Oh, that's a lot.

3614
02:50:18,550 --> 02:50:23,180
Oh my god, I'm trying so hard.

3615
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,480
Wait, is the paw weak?

3616
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:29,820
I can't tell.

3617
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:30,400
Guys!

3618
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:31,960
Guys, the paw was not weak!

3619
02:50:35,820 --> 02:50:39,280
Guys, I'm no longer listening to you guys.

3620
02:50:39,820 --> 02:50:41,580
I'm no longer gonna listen.

3621
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:45,700
Aw, damn it.

3622
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:52,060
Here we go.

3623
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:53,440
Oh.

3624
02:51:02,050 --> 02:51:05,410
Oh my god, no way!

3625
02:51:06,170 --> 02:51:07,450
Oh, I'm fucking it up.

3626
02:51:07,710 --> 02:51:09,130
I'm fucking it up, guys.

3627
02:51:09,830 --> 02:51:11,430
I'm fucking it up, guys.

3628
02:51:13,130 --> 02:51:14,950
I'm fucking it up right now.

3629
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:17,270
Oh no.

3630
02:51:18,210 --> 02:51:18,830
Ping, guys!

3631
02:51:18,890 --> 02:51:19,530
It was ping!

3632
02:51:19,930 --> 02:51:22,250
Oh, so when she's doing Toho...

3633
02:51:22,250 --> 02:51:24,510
When she's doing Toho, it's a weak point, right?

3634
02:51:24,550 --> 02:51:25,290
Is that what you mean?

3635
02:51:28,090 --> 02:51:31,490
Guys, I hope you're not fucking with me because I'm hitting the pot!

3636
02:51:32,610 --> 02:51:33,250
Oh

3637
02:51:38,170 --> 02:51:38,670
my god, okay.

3638
02:51:39,390 --> 02:51:40,990
Oh, I missed two.

3639
02:51:45,080 --> 02:51:46,040
Oh no.

3640
02:51:50,500 --> 02:51:51,380
Oh god.

3641
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:53,120
Here we go.

3642
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:55,260
Oh.

3643
02:51:57,060 --> 02:51:57,700
Oh!

3644
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:00,160
Ah!

3645
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:02,500
I didn't see!

3646
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,300
What hit me?

3647
02:52:04,980 --> 02:52:05,420
Ah!

3648
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:10,520
I didn't see!

3649
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:12,180
What hit me?

3650
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:17,200
What hit me?

3651
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:22,480
Oh my god.

3652
02:52:27,190 --> 02:52:31,090
The reason why I don't get closer is because I can't.

3653
02:52:31,190 --> 02:52:32,510
She's too fast.

3654
02:52:34,270 --> 02:52:36,610
She's actually too fast to get close.

3655
02:52:41,490 --> 02:52:42,130
Oh.

3656
02:52:49,800 --> 02:52:51,720
Okay, that doesn't do anything.

3657
02:52:52,580 --> 02:52:55,100
I'll just stand here because it's safe.

3658
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,440
This grandma's too fast.

3659
02:53:04,530 --> 02:53:05,870
I'm fucking it up!

3660
02:53:07,890 --> 02:53:09,970
I got too... Oh my god.

3661
02:53:11,090 --> 02:53:11,570
Okay.

3662
02:53:12,170 --> 02:53:13,370
I got too close.

3663
02:53:13,470 --> 02:53:14,090
I got too greedy.

3664
02:53:17,660 --> 02:53:19,560
I got way too greedy there.

3665
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:21,280
Okay.

3666
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:24,880
This grandma's way too fast.

3667
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:27,060
Can I damage her when she's in this form?

3668
02:53:27,620 --> 02:53:28,320
No, right?

3669
02:53:33,460 --> 02:53:34,040
Yeah?

3670
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:34,600
I can?

3671
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:36,040
No?

3672
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:36,720
Guys.

3673
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:39,960
Oh, I can.

3674
02:53:40,040 --> 02:53:40,300
Okay.

3675
02:53:41,180 --> 02:53:42,080
Okay, that's good to know.

3676
02:53:48,770 --> 02:53:49,350
Okay.

3677
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:51,610
Jesus Christ.

3678
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:56,320
Ngh!

3679
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:02,360
Jesus.

3680
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:05,060
Okay, I just gotta fucking run around.

3681
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:07,400
I can't be cocky here.

3682
02:54:09,180 --> 02:54:10,060
Okay.

3683
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:14,580
Yeah, I greeded that.

3684
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:17,500
Okay.

3685
02:54:18,420 --> 02:54:19,020
Oh!

3686
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:22,140
Toho.

3687
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:25,960
Toho by standing still.

3688
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:29,600
Just like how I know my Toho.

3689
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:35,950
Okay.

3690
02:54:38,310 --> 02:54:40,050
Okay, I can be greedy for these.

3691
02:54:42,590 --> 02:54:43,150
Okay.

3692
02:54:46,780 --> 02:54:47,340
Okay.

3693
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:48,820
Oh!

3694
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:53,820
If she does these, I have to actually just run around.

3695
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:57,980
Oh!

3696
02:54:58,220 --> 02:55:00,300
I didn't realize there was a third one!

3697
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:03,880
Call me.

3698
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:04,680
Call me.

3699
02:55:04,860 --> 02:55:05,220
Oh!

3700
02:55:06,940 --> 02:55:07,400
Oh!

3701
02:55:09,740 --> 02:55:11,640
Name five Toho characters.

3702
02:55:11,780 --> 02:55:12,740
So there's Toho.

3703
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:15,020
And then there's...

3704
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:15,420
Fuck!

3705
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:16,560
I'm...

3706
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:20,760
I'm...

3707
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,740
You guys...

3708
02:55:21,740 --> 02:55:22,920
God damn it!

3709
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:24,420
I blame you guys.

3710
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:25,420
I...

3711
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:26,200
I...

3712
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:28,140
I blame you guys.

3713
02:55:28,640 --> 02:55:29,200
I...

3714
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:31,940
You guys distracted me.

3715
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:37,180
You guys actually distracted me.

3716
02:55:38,940 --> 02:55:41,220
Oh my god.

3717
02:55:41,980 --> 02:55:43,420
God damn it.

3718
02:55:47,140 --> 02:55:48,400
My god.

3719
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:49,800
I think I'm dead.

3720
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:53,320
I can't...

3721
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:55,020
God damn it.

3722
02:55:58,690 --> 02:56:00,230
Jesus Christ.

3723
02:56:00,370 --> 02:56:00,610
Okay.

3724
02:56:01,930 --> 02:56:02,810
What?!

3725
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:05,270
I was through the hole!

3726
02:56:06,390 --> 02:56:07,530
What was the

3727
02:56:11,390 --> 02:56:12,550
hitbox?!

3728
02:56:13,330 --> 02:56:15,470
Oh my god.

3729
02:56:17,330 --> 02:56:19,170
That hitbox was crazy.

3730
02:56:19,350 --> 02:56:21,150
I was actually through the hole.

3731
02:56:21,410 --> 02:56:22,210
You don't understand.

3732
02:56:22,910 --> 02:56:24,250
I was through the hole.

3733
02:56:24,490 --> 02:56:27,230
I swear it looked like I was through.

3734
02:56:28,090 --> 02:56:29,570
There's no way!

3735
02:56:33,330 --> 02:56:34,190
There's no way.

3736
02:56:34,370 --> 02:56:35,550
There's no fucking way.

3737
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:37,730
No fucking way.

3738
02:56:37,930 --> 02:56:39,270
I'm so mad.

3739
02:56:41,130 --> 02:56:42,010
No way.

3740
02:56:42,150 --> 02:56:43,530
No, I did not get hit.

3741
02:56:43,610 --> 02:56:45,250
I refuse to believe that.

3742
02:56:45,850 --> 02:56:47,530
I did not get hit there.

3743
02:56:48,170 --> 02:56:49,910
There was no way I got hit there.

3744
02:56:51,790 --> 02:56:52,750
Can I actually smack it?

3745
02:56:52,890 --> 02:56:54,190
No, I don't believe you guys.

3746
02:56:54,670 --> 02:56:55,450
You guys like...

3747
02:56:55,450 --> 02:56:57,730
You guys have given me so much misinformation.

3748
02:57:01,770 --> 02:57:03,590
I don't believe anymore.

3749
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:15,330
Okay.

3750
02:57:30,690 --> 02:57:31,330
Alright.

3751
02:57:34,110 --> 02:57:34,750
Okay.

3752
02:57:35,190 --> 02:57:35,950
Got me, huh?

3753
02:57:36,670 --> 02:57:37,690
Okay, Toho time.

3754
02:57:43,050 --> 02:57:43,350
Alright.

3755
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:45,090
Okay, nice.

3756
02:57:49,300 --> 02:57:50,060
Oh, whoa!

3757
02:57:50,720 --> 02:57:51,840
God damn it.

3758
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:55,680
Okay,

3759
02:57:59,400 --> 02:57:59,940
where is he?

3760
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:00,720
Is he gonna appear?

3761
02:58:03,820 --> 02:58:06,220
Okay, I'm focusing up.

3762
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:07,720
Oh, there you go.

3763
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:09,400
Two hits.

3764
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:13,400
Oh my god.

3765
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:14,680
Nice.

3766
02:58:15,800 --> 02:58:17,420
Oh my god, you stupid granny.

3767
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:19,460
You stupid fucking granny.

3768
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:21,880
Oh fuck, I'm sorry.

3769
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:23,640
I swear to god.

3770
02:58:23,860 --> 02:58:27,320
Okay, I'm gonna try and hit it once and then see if you're lying to me.

3771
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:32,060
Oh my god!

3772
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:43,220
I did it.

3773
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:43,940
Okay.

3774
02:58:45,700 --> 02:58:46,620
Guys!

3775
02:58:47,460 --> 02:58:50,940
It's very hard to believe you guys sometimes, okay?

3776
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:55,880
This whole time.

3777
02:58:59,240 --> 02:59:00,940
I can't believe it.

3778
02:59:00,940 --> 02:59:03,000
I never needed that Toho.

3779
02:59:10,320 --> 02:59:11,040
Whoa.

3780
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:16,260
My god, why is there a crow there?

3781
02:59:20,430 --> 02:59:25,150
We gather here today to mourn the passing of a woman known by many names.

3782
02:59:25,570 --> 02:59:27,010
The Witch of Urns.

3783
02:59:28,050 --> 02:59:29,350
The Ceramic Sorceress.

3784
02:59:29,810 --> 02:59:31,210
The Earthworm Enchantress.

3785
02:59:31,330 --> 02:59:32,530
The Crockery Crone.

3786
02:59:32,830 --> 02:59:34,730
And of course, Grandma.

3787
02:59:35,930 --> 02:59:40,990
Driven by maternal instincts and consumed by endeavors that with death...

3788
02:59:40,990 --> 02:59:47,110
She filled her life with passion for magic, renamation potions, and pots.

3789
02:59:48,030 --> 02:59:51,330
Her journey is concluded and she is now at peace.

3790
02:59:52,670 --> 02:59:53,770
Bow your head in remembrance.

3791
02:59:54,550 --> 02:59:55,930
Pay your last respects.

3792
02:59:56,570 --> 02:59:58,070
Wait, but you're still a pothead.

3793
02:59:58,670 --> 03:00:00,830
Her time in this world is over.

3794
03:00:01,410 --> 03:00:02,730
How are we gonna fix him now?

3795
03:00:02,730 --> 03:00:04,290
We killed the one...

3796
03:00:04,290 --> 03:00:06,410
What if I just...

3797
03:00:06,410 --> 03:00:08,250
Let's bow our heads in remembrance.

3798
03:00:08,450 --> 03:00:09,770
I'm like...

3799
03:00:10,710 --> 03:00:12,170
I suppose I'll never... Yeah.

3800
03:00:12,450 --> 03:00:14,910
Yeah, we killed her before she could fix you.

3801
03:00:15,690 --> 03:00:19,030
Still, I hope she finds peace beyond life.

3802
03:00:20,530 --> 03:00:22,990
She'll finally be reunited with Grandpa.

3803
03:00:24,830 --> 03:00:26,170
Split slip of the tongue.

3804
03:00:26,350 --> 03:00:28,090
I quite literally have pots on the brain.

3805
03:00:28,810 --> 03:00:29,850
Seriously, though.

3806
03:00:30,150 --> 03:00:31,070
Rest in peace, Gran.

3807
03:00:32,730 --> 03:00:33,690
Can I kill you now?

3808
03:00:34,450 --> 03:00:34,670
No.

3809
03:00:35,530 --> 03:00:37,710
She died as she lived with a pot on her head.

3810
03:00:38,190 --> 03:00:38,630
Okay.

3811
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:42,150
I did it.

3812
03:00:42,670 --> 03:00:43,110
Yippee.

3813
03:00:44,190 --> 03:00:45,450
I did it.

3814
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:53,500
I wonder if there's... I wonder if they'll still be around.

3815
03:00:53,660 --> 03:00:55,160
I bet the enemies will still be around.

3816
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:57,640
Victor, thank you for the super chat.

3817
03:00:57,720 --> 03:00:58,660
Thank you, thank you.

3818
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:02,780
My birthday was a few days ago.

3819
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:03,960
Can I get a happy birthday?

3820
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:05,360
Of course you can, Victor.

3821
03:01:05,360 --> 03:01:07,720
Happy birthday to you.

3822
03:01:07,900 --> 03:01:09,200
Wait, where am I?

3823
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:11,740
Happy birthday to you.

3824
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:12,800
Happy... Whoa!

3825
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:15,900
Happy birthday, dear Victor.

3826
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:17,860
Oh, it's still Grim Reaper!

3827
03:01:18,460 --> 03:01:20,340
Happy birthday to you.

3828
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:20,820
Yeah!

3829
03:01:22,240 --> 03:01:22,840
Caw.

3830
03:01:23,860 --> 03:01:25,120
The Lord of Doors.

3831
03:01:25,300 --> 03:01:26,340
Well, a crow.

3832
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:27,840
Hello there.

3833
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:30,580
And how exactly did you get in here?

3834
03:01:32,260 --> 03:01:35,620
What's the point in having command over all the doors in this world...

3835
03:01:35,620 --> 03:01:37,780
when servants never remember to lock them?

3836
03:01:41,850 --> 03:01:43,050
Oh my god, it's him!

3837
03:01:43,130 --> 03:01:44,010
The King of Doors!

3838
03:01:45,250 --> 03:01:46,650
Sorry, the Lord of Doors.

3839
03:01:47,390 --> 03:01:48,410
So why are you here?

3840
03:01:49,610 --> 03:01:52,610
I haven't actually met a crow in many, many years.

3841
03:01:53,550 --> 03:01:55,310
You still have those... beaks.

3842
03:01:56,330 --> 03:01:56,750
Nice.

3843
03:01:57,830 --> 03:01:58,250
Nice.

3844
03:01:58,250 --> 03:01:58,370
Nice.

3845
03:02:00,110 --> 03:02:04,590
I sense a vast amount of soul energy about you, little crow.

3846
03:02:05,570 --> 03:02:08,810
Strange, it feels oddly familiar to me.

3847
03:02:10,030 --> 03:02:11,510
So is that why you're here?

3848
03:02:12,490 --> 03:02:14,210
You've come seeking a reward?

3849
03:02:24,230 --> 03:02:24,610
Yay!

3850
03:02:27,480 --> 03:02:28,820
Clap, clap, clap, clap.

3851
03:02:29,360 --> 03:02:30,500
Very good job there.

3852
03:02:30,580 --> 03:02:31,260
That's me!

3853
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,420
I get a gold star!

3854
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:35,160
Yay!

3855
03:02:42,150 --> 03:02:44,050
Guys, I need compliments, okay?

3856
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:48,250
Now be a good little bird...

3857
03:02:48,250 --> 03:02:49,430
and turn him into your vault.

3858
03:02:50,130 --> 03:02:51,950
There's no need to bring souls directly to me.

3859
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:54,310
I have more important matters to attend to.

3860
03:02:55,330 --> 03:02:55,670
Ciao!

3861
03:02:56,130 --> 03:02:57,290
Oh my god, and he's Italian?

3862
03:02:58,610 --> 03:02:59,090
Woah!

3863
03:02:59,890 --> 03:03:00,510
You suck.

3864
03:03:04,090 --> 03:03:05,870
Accenture, thank you for the superchat, thank you.

3865
03:03:08,170 --> 03:03:12,730
Miller, thank you for the superchat, thank you.

3866
03:03:13,330 --> 03:03:18,190
Hello Doki, my birthday was on the first, but you were playing the Vtuber Rivals, so I didn't say anything then.

3867
03:03:18,310 --> 03:03:19,550
Can I still get a happy birthday?

3868
03:03:19,730 --> 03:03:20,290
Of course!

3869
03:03:20,530 --> 03:03:23,730
You claimed it within 30 days, so you got the pass.

3870
03:03:24,430 --> 03:03:29,670
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

3871
03:03:29,790 --> 03:03:33,330
Happy birthday dear Miller, happy birthday to you.

3872
03:03:33,850 --> 03:03:35,950
What are you doing here?

3873
03:03:36,330 --> 03:03:37,510
Did you find your assignment yet?

3874
03:03:38,130 --> 03:03:39,970
Wait, you have a giant soul.

3875
03:03:40,590 --> 03:03:41,770
But it's the wrong one?

3876
03:03:42,030 --> 03:03:43,290
I can't process that.

3877
03:03:44,730 --> 03:03:46,010
How did you manage that?

3878
03:03:47,990 --> 03:03:48,590
Nevermind.

3879
03:03:48,850 --> 03:03:50,350
Get back there and find your assignments.

3880
03:03:50,350 --> 03:03:53,570
Wait, but they already took my giant soul.

3881
03:03:54,550 --> 03:03:55,990
I can't do anything.

3882
03:03:56,410 --> 03:03:58,130
Alright, I'm gonna save up for strength, guys.

3883
03:03:58,870 --> 03:04:00,810
Or I could, actually I'm gonna grab range.

3884
03:04:02,490 --> 03:04:03,330
Increase the damage.

3885
03:04:03,610 --> 03:04:05,750
And then next up, I'll put it on strength again.

3886
03:04:06,790 --> 03:04:08,470
I'm going all in on strength, guys.

3887
03:04:12,070 --> 03:04:12,870
Small goose!

3888
03:04:13,090 --> 03:04:14,150
Wait, where do I go?

3889
03:04:17,650 --> 03:04:18,950
I have a giant soul.

3890
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:24,420
Where'd I go?

3891
03:04:26,580 --> 03:04:27,940
Me confused.

3892
03:04:35,670 --> 03:04:36,350
Spirits?

3893
03:04:38,470 --> 03:04:39,670
To a door.

3894
03:04:39,970 --> 03:04:41,610
Guys, I fucking know I have to go...

3895
03:04:42,870 --> 03:04:44,810
To a door, you fucking idiot.

3896
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:49,350
Is it the Grove of Spirits?

3897
03:04:51,630 --> 03:04:52,990
Where am I?

3898
03:04:55,470 --> 03:04:57,090
I don't think it's here.

3899
03:04:57,170 --> 03:04:57,910
That's a tutorial.

3900
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:09,160
Where do I go?

3901
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:11,460
I fell down.

3902
03:05:13,640 --> 03:05:15,990
The Urn's Witch's Laboratory.

3903
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:18,180
The Manor.

3904
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:20,740
State.

3905
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:22,540
Inner Furnace.

3906
03:05:24,580 --> 03:05:26,160
Is it the Cliff Door?

3907
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:29,740
Which one was the Cliff Door?

3908
03:05:30,740 --> 03:05:31,800
This one?

3909
03:05:32,620 --> 03:05:33,640
That's the Cemetery.

3910
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:35,400
Oh, the Summit Door.

3911
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:37,820
Where the fuck was the Summit Door?

3912
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:39,740
At a Summit Door?

3913
03:05:41,140 --> 03:05:42,440
Oh, that's the Cemetery?

3914
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:42,900
Okay.

3915
03:05:45,260 --> 03:05:45,900
Alright.

3916
03:05:47,440 --> 03:05:49,100
I'll figure this out.

3917
03:05:50,360 --> 03:05:51,600
Where was the Summit?

3918
03:05:52,380 --> 03:05:53,200
I'll figure...

3919
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:56,600
I'll still figure this out.

3920
03:05:57,780 --> 03:05:58,880
Was it up here?

3921
03:05:59,460 --> 03:06:00,600
It was up here, right?

3922
03:06:05,950 --> 03:06:07,730
Yeah, I don't know now.

3923
03:06:08,470 --> 03:06:09,110
It was here.

3924
03:06:11,270 --> 03:06:11,970
I don't remember.

3925
03:06:14,250 --> 03:06:16,950
Oh, does my Comet Hog go through here now?

3926
03:06:17,610 --> 03:06:19,170
No, I'm still too weak.

3927
03:06:19,810 --> 03:06:21,090
I'm a weak-ass bird.

3928
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:26,290
Actually, I'm gonna run through these.

3929
03:06:26,410 --> 03:06:27,390
These guys don't matter.

3930
03:06:29,450 --> 03:06:30,010
Whoa!

3931
03:06:30,510 --> 03:06:31,850
Chill, everybody.

3932
03:06:32,670 --> 03:06:33,230
Chill.

3933
03:06:34,170 --> 03:06:35,410
Oh, wait, what?

3934
03:06:35,570 --> 03:06:36,530
I can do that?

3935
03:06:36,670 --> 03:06:37,470
All this time?

3936
03:06:38,170 --> 03:06:39,350
Nice, my one soul.

3937
03:06:40,710 --> 03:06:41,590
Hello, children.

3938
03:06:42,310 --> 03:06:42,650
Leave!

3939
03:06:44,130 --> 03:06:45,750
It's not my day yet.

3940
03:06:45,970 --> 03:06:47,330
It's not my custody day.

3941
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:50,230
Okay, we go up here.

3942
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:58,060
Okay, not this way.

3943
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:05,360
It should be up here.

3944
03:07:09,740 --> 03:07:10,440
Whoops.

3945
03:07:12,820 --> 03:07:14,360
Wait, what's over here?

3946
03:07:17,200 --> 03:07:19,800
Yeah, it's not the weekend yet with Dad.

3947
03:07:22,740 --> 03:07:23,740
God, wait.

3948
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:29,980
Okay.

3949
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:32,800
I must have forgot a door or some shit.

3950
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:35,560
That's why I have to fucking walk so far.

3951
03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:37,900
I forgot a lock up here?

3952
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:40,060
I don't know.

3953
03:07:40,180 --> 03:07:41,340
I'm so confused.

3954
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:47,120
What are you doing?

3955
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:47,720
Huh?

3956
03:07:49,640 --> 03:07:50,760
It's Thursday!

3957
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,020
I got a soul.

3958
03:08:14,240 --> 03:08:15,220
Where's East?

3959
03:08:18,320 --> 03:08:19,720
Wait,

3960
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:24,520
where's East?

3961
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:28,680
I don't remember which way is East.

3962
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:30,260
East is right.

3963
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:31,980
Okay, it's the right side.

3964
03:08:34,040 --> 03:08:35,180
It's this way.

3965
03:08:38,240 --> 03:08:40,520
Okay, it's the one I opened earlier, I think.

3966
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:41,740
It has to be this, right?

3967
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:47,260
I remember West Coast is left because I'm in the West Coast.

3968
03:08:47,680 --> 03:08:49,040
So East is always the right.

3969
03:08:49,960 --> 03:08:51,340
That's how I remember things.

3970
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:54,820
Oh wait, I can just fall down from there.

3971
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:03,420
It has to be stuff here, right?

3972
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:07,600
Yeah, there's money.

3973
03:09:11,060 --> 03:09:12,040
Okay, nice.

3974
03:09:12,780 --> 03:09:13,900
There's more money.

3975
03:09:21,420 --> 03:09:21,900
Wait...

3976
03:09:23,280 --> 03:09:24,540
I haven't been here.

3977
03:09:26,260 --> 03:09:27,800
Oh yeah, that's where I have to go.

3978
03:09:27,800 --> 03:09:29,400
Okay, I'm gonna check over here first.

3979
03:09:32,040 --> 03:09:34,640
Hey mom, I found you on the fucking street.

3980
03:09:36,400 --> 03:09:38,120
You were abandoned first.

3981
03:09:40,240 --> 03:09:41,900
You're lucky I found it.

3982
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:44,680
I found the seed and I planted it.

3983
03:09:44,820 --> 03:09:45,860
You're welcome, children.

3984
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:48,400
Okay, that was a shortcut.

3985
03:09:56,940 --> 03:09:59,000
Yeah, I'm like, what fucking mom?

3986
03:10:03,360 --> 03:10:04,960
Yeah, okay.

3987
03:10:06,260 --> 03:10:08,100
What the fuck?

3988
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:10,560
Is that your purpose in life?

3989
03:10:11,240 --> 03:10:13,620
Oh my god, that's his purpose.

3990
03:10:14,180 --> 03:10:15,840
That's all he does.

3991
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:20,820
Does he even get paid?

3992
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:29,430
This is his entire life.

3993
03:10:30,130 --> 03:10:32,530
It's called a 9 to 5.

3994
03:10:32,650 --> 03:10:33,730
You won't ever understand.

3995
03:10:33,730 --> 03:10:34,970
You'll never understand, Turkey.

3996
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:43,440
Oh, I can definitely not go there.

3997
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:46,420
Oh wait, this is like a tree level.

3998
03:10:46,960 --> 03:10:48,600
So that means that...

3999
03:10:48,600 --> 03:10:49,320
Which lever?

4000
03:10:49,400 --> 03:10:50,020
Oh, that's a lever.

4001
03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:51,080
Couldn't tell.

4002
03:10:53,240 --> 03:10:54,380
Okay, big door.

4003
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:03,440
Oh?

4004
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:04,720
Key!

4005
03:11:06,100 --> 03:11:07,320
Oh my god, wait.

4006
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,160
Wouldn't my fire be like really strong on him?

4007
03:11:11,300 --> 03:11:12,920
What the fuck are you gonna do?

4008
03:11:13,360 --> 03:11:14,060
You're stationary.

4009
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:18,260
Alright.

4010
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:21,900
Yeah, what the fuck are you gonna do?

4011
03:11:21,980 --> 03:11:23,080
You can't even move.

4012
03:11:23,340 --> 03:11:23,820
Stupid.

4013
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:27,100
I'll cut you too.

4014
03:11:27,280 --> 03:11:27,900
Oh shit.

4015
03:11:28,600 --> 03:11:28,840
Hello.

4016
03:11:37,160 --> 03:11:38,120
I'm strong!

4017
03:11:38,240 --> 03:11:39,060
Watch this!

4018
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:42,140
Sorry, this is the first time that happened.

4019
03:11:44,300 --> 03:11:47,940
Don't worry, the second time I'll swear I can totally do it.

4020
03:11:47,980 --> 03:11:48,420
Look at that.

4021
03:11:48,720 --> 03:11:50,280
See, this is how I found you guys.

4022
03:11:50,660 --> 03:11:51,160
Look at that.

4023
03:11:51,380 --> 03:11:52,540
You were already abandoned.

4024
03:11:52,900 --> 03:11:54,100
But I picked you up.

4025
03:11:54,560 --> 03:11:55,180
Look at that.

4026
03:11:55,540 --> 03:11:56,180
You're welcome.

4027
03:12:01,290 --> 03:12:02,290
Alright, we go this way.

4028
03:12:06,990 --> 03:12:08,590
Okay, you're not that strong.

4029
03:12:12,070 --> 03:12:12,910
Get over here.

4030
03:12:13,030 --> 03:12:13,790
Oh shit!

4031
03:12:14,390 --> 03:12:15,870
Oh my god, okay.

4032
03:12:15,870 --> 03:12:16,970
Now I know.

4033
03:12:17,350 --> 03:12:18,250
Now I know.

4034
03:12:19,410 --> 03:12:21,350
Now I know they can do that.

4035
03:12:22,110 --> 03:12:23,110
What's this?

4036
03:12:24,690 --> 03:12:26,070
Oh, it's a bomb.

4037
03:12:27,850 --> 03:12:29,710
Oh, I can like use it.

4038
03:12:29,970 --> 03:12:31,890
Oh, wait, that's so cool.

4039
03:12:34,290 --> 03:12:35,330
Hey, I like that.

4040
03:12:36,190 --> 03:12:37,130
That's a cool ability.

4041
03:12:39,890 --> 03:12:41,310
Okay, that's sad.

4042
03:12:42,170 --> 03:12:43,690
They're like, um...

4043
03:12:43,690 --> 03:12:45,870
They're like that piranha plant in Mario.

4044
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:47,710
You know what?

4045
03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:49,570
Just cause I hate you.

4046
03:12:50,930 --> 03:12:51,870
There you go.

4047
03:12:51,950 --> 03:12:53,130
For no reason too.

4048
03:12:54,350 --> 03:12:55,050
Oh, wait!

4049
03:13:01,210 --> 03:13:03,710
I am so fucking smart!

4050
03:13:07,540 --> 03:13:08,980
Oh my god.

4051
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:11,860
I was like, that shit looks strong as hell.

4052
03:13:15,300 --> 03:13:16,420
I knew it.

4053
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:17,700
Alright, time to plant my seed.

4054
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:20,520
Okay.

4055
03:13:20,620 --> 03:13:21,960
Oh, I can interrupt it too.

4056
03:13:22,140 --> 03:13:22,620
That's good.

4057
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:24,380
That's good to know.

4058
03:13:30,790 --> 03:13:31,130
Okay.

4059
03:13:32,330 --> 03:13:32,770
Whoa!

4060
03:13:33,650 --> 03:13:35,050
Okay, I i-framed that.

4061
03:13:35,610 --> 03:13:38,250
I feel like the i-frame is so inconsistent though.

4062
03:13:38,850 --> 03:13:39,470
I don't know.

4063
03:13:39,590 --> 03:13:41,270
Oh, it rears fire too.

4064
03:13:43,710 --> 03:13:44,530
The i-frame?

4065
03:13:44,770 --> 03:13:45,270
I don't know.

4066
03:13:45,370 --> 03:13:47,210
Or like, it's like super...

4067
03:13:47,890 --> 03:13:49,870
It's like super tight or something.

4068
03:13:49,870 --> 03:13:52,850
Like, the timing for it is like incredibly tight.

4069
03:13:54,350 --> 03:13:55,810
That's like hard to time.

4070
03:13:58,290 --> 03:13:59,090
Not just you.

4071
03:13:59,110 --> 03:13:59,890
Or it could just be me.

4072
03:13:59,930 --> 03:14:00,430
I don't know.

4073
03:14:03,010 --> 03:14:03,890
I can...

4074
03:14:03,890 --> 03:14:05,250
Get it to hit here.

4075
03:14:06,530 --> 03:14:06,950
Aww.

4076
03:14:08,010 --> 03:14:10,030
I wonder if I can get it to hit that bridge.

4077
03:14:14,500 --> 03:14:15,520
No, I can't.

4078
03:14:18,060 --> 03:14:19,340
But what would this hit?

4079
03:14:20,640 --> 03:14:23,840
I guess like...

4080
03:14:25,590 --> 03:14:26,270
What?!

4081
03:14:26,270 --> 03:14:26,530
Okay.

4082
03:14:27,550 --> 03:14:29,070
I don't know if I got hit or not.

4083
03:14:29,850 --> 03:14:31,110
There's just so many plants.

4084
03:14:31,290 --> 03:14:31,450
Okay.

4085
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:32,390
Oh, wait.

4086
03:14:32,550 --> 03:14:32,830
What?

4087
03:14:34,010 --> 03:14:36,310
I don't think I can move fast enough though.

4088
03:14:36,870 --> 03:14:37,350
Yeah.

4089
03:14:38,030 --> 03:14:40,230
I don't think I can move fast enough for that.

4090
03:14:40,850 --> 03:14:41,390
Fuck!

4091
03:14:41,850 --> 03:14:42,390
Okay.

4092
03:14:43,370 --> 03:14:44,890
I sorta walked into it.

4093
03:14:46,950 --> 03:14:47,490
Think?

4094
03:14:47,710 --> 03:14:48,390
I'm thinking.

4095
03:14:48,390 --> 03:14:48,810
I'm thinking.

4096
03:14:49,390 --> 03:14:50,830
I'm thinking.

4097
03:14:52,790 --> 03:14:54,350
I'm thinking.

4098
03:14:54,970 --> 03:14:56,610
I'm just gonna...

4099
03:14:56,610 --> 03:14:58,090
I have to eat.

4100
03:15:00,590 --> 03:15:01,550
Um...

4101
03:15:01,550 --> 03:15:02,790
What?

4102
03:15:08,730 --> 03:15:09,630
Oh!

4103
03:15:11,970 --> 03:15:13,630
I'm so smart.

4104
03:15:14,230 --> 03:15:15,210
I didn't look at chat.

4105
03:15:19,500 --> 03:15:20,740
That's right.

4106
03:15:21,220 --> 03:15:23,140
I figured it out by myself.

4107
03:15:26,220 --> 03:15:27,060
Uh-huh.

4108
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:30,120
You have no proof.

4109
03:15:30,900 --> 03:15:31,920
You have no proof.

4110
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:33,520
My head was facing that way.

4111
03:15:36,300 --> 03:15:38,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

4112
03:15:38,380 --> 03:15:39,260
Where's your proof?

4113
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:42,120
I'm just very smart.

4114
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,600
How do I get that?

4115
03:15:51,620 --> 03:15:53,240
I think I need a special ability.

4116
03:15:53,320 --> 03:15:53,840
What the fuck?

4117
03:15:54,480 --> 03:15:55,840
It's a random insect.

4118
03:15:55,960 --> 03:15:57,440
Try to fucking kill me.

4119
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:02,100
I like these mechanics though.

4120
03:16:08,240 --> 03:16:09,400
Is it?

4121
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:10,320
Oh, is this a town?

4122
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:16,760
Ooh, that's rough, buddy.

4123
03:16:27,810 --> 03:16:29,130
Hello, feathery person.

4124
03:16:29,370 --> 03:16:31,890
I'm hard of hearing, so you will have to speak up.

4125
03:16:32,850 --> 03:16:33,530
Hey there!

4126
03:16:33,770 --> 03:16:35,170
You look like a fellow traveler.

4127
03:16:36,250 --> 03:16:37,430
What brings you here?

4128
03:16:37,610 --> 03:16:39,990
Did you come to learn the music of the forest children as well?

4129
03:16:40,510 --> 03:16:43,210
What a shame it is that the forest elder lost her horn.

4130
03:16:43,890 --> 03:16:46,510
I hope she finds it soon so I can hear her beautiful melodies.

4131
03:16:48,090 --> 03:16:49,170
Hey, where is she?

4132
03:16:49,870 --> 03:16:50,850
Is she hot?

4133
03:16:52,350 --> 03:16:53,650
Who's the forest elder?

4134
03:16:54,890 --> 03:16:56,470
Is she cute?

4135
03:16:57,090 --> 03:16:59,030
Oh, am I gonna find more seeds?

4136
03:16:59,650 --> 03:17:00,690
Oh, no seeds.

4137
03:17:04,730 --> 03:17:05,690
Oh shit!

4138
03:17:05,810 --> 03:17:05,930
Okay.

4139
03:17:06,710 --> 03:17:08,170
This is a little scary though.

4140
03:17:11,910 --> 03:17:13,350
Okay, I gotta get rid of him.

4141
03:17:18,480 --> 03:17:19,080
Okay.

4142
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:19,900
Oh wait, leather!

4143
03:17:20,440 --> 03:17:20,860
Shortcut!

4144
03:17:22,220 --> 03:17:23,220
More shortcuts!

4145
03:17:23,640 --> 03:17:25,000
That I'm gonna forget about.

4146
03:17:25,460 --> 03:17:26,620
Because there's too many shortcuts.

4147
03:17:28,260 --> 03:17:30,160
There's too many shortcuts, guys.

4148
03:17:31,580 --> 03:17:33,340
There's way too many shortcuts.

4149
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:34,600
Oh my god.

4150
03:17:34,640 --> 03:17:36,260
There's so much to this map.

4151
03:17:36,540 --> 03:17:38,120
Oh my god!

4152
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:40,740
Look, I picked up a seed though.

4153
03:17:44,420 --> 03:17:45,900
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

4154
03:17:45,940 --> 03:17:46,700
I'm gonna backtrack.

4155
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:50,040
Because I didn't explore more of the backside.

4156
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:51,300
Oh wait!

4157
03:17:52,440 --> 03:17:53,560
Wait, what the fuck?

4158
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:54,580
You're following me.

4159
03:17:55,640 --> 03:17:56,420
Big fan.

4160
03:17:58,460 --> 03:18:00,460
Lots of shortcuts that I'm gonna forget about.

4161
03:18:00,560 --> 03:18:02,540
Is this the...

4162
03:18:02,540 --> 03:18:04,260
Oh shit, I forgot to talk to the what?

4163
03:18:04,340 --> 03:18:05,660
The most important person.

4164
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:26,540
But we converse in songs, sadly.

4165
03:18:27,160 --> 03:18:29,120
I have lost my magic horn.

4166
03:18:29,660 --> 03:18:31,600
I left it in the old camp to the north.

4167
03:18:32,100 --> 03:18:35,300
Alas, we were driven from there by the Frog King's henchmen.

4168
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:39,040
If you return to me, I'm sure we can help you on your journey.

4169
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:41,940
Okay, we gotta find a magic horn for the big lady.

4170
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:43,340
Big strong lady.

4171
03:18:44,660 --> 03:18:46,820
Hey, was there anything over here that I missed?

4172
03:18:47,360 --> 03:18:49,480
No, I didn't go up here though.

4173
03:18:50,140 --> 03:18:51,660
There's a ladder up here.

4174
03:18:54,580 --> 03:18:56,740
I need to steal some stuff from them.

4175
03:18:58,460 --> 03:18:59,100
Yoink!

4176
03:18:59,420 --> 03:19:00,240
Another cut city.

4177
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:02,500
Right now.

4178
03:19:06,030 --> 03:19:07,130
Giant woman.

4179
03:19:07,850 --> 03:19:09,410
Wait, where am I?

4180
03:19:09,970 --> 03:19:11,750
Oh, I thought I accidentally...

4181
03:19:11,750 --> 03:19:14,750
I was gonna say I accidentally clipped into it.

4182
03:19:15,690 --> 03:19:16,010
No.

4183
03:19:17,290 --> 03:19:19,490
Wait, I can't do anything there.

4184
03:19:19,730 --> 03:19:21,610
Okay, I'll just pull this lever.

4185
03:19:25,240 --> 03:19:25,760
Okay.

4186
03:19:26,040 --> 03:19:28,040
That's for another area.

4187
03:19:29,480 --> 03:19:30,840
I'll go this way then.

4188
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:34,020
Oh my god, they're all following me.

4189
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:35,400
You little freaks.

4190
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:36,780
Don't do this.

4191
03:19:36,860 --> 03:19:37,800
That's fucking...

4192
03:19:37,800 --> 03:19:39,100
Oh, you're crying now?

4193
03:19:39,200 --> 03:19:39,660
That's all?

4194
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:40,060
Shit!

4195
03:19:43,440 --> 03:19:46,780
Okay, that may or may not have been karma, guys.

4196
03:19:48,720 --> 03:19:52,320
I may or may not have just got karma there.

4197
03:19:53,220 --> 03:19:54,800
Stupid kids.

4198
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:02,840
Get rid of these guys.

4199
03:20:05,660 --> 03:20:07,060
Okay, nice.

4200
03:20:08,140 --> 03:20:08,480
Okay.

4201
03:20:10,340 --> 03:20:12,000
That's right, what you gonna do?

4202
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:12,680
Nothing!

4203
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:16,780
Okay, bring me up top.

4204
03:20:17,540 --> 03:20:19,460
I want uppies now.

4205
03:20:20,500 --> 03:20:21,740
Give me uppies!

4206
03:20:23,380 --> 03:20:24,040
Oh, shit.

4207
03:20:26,440 --> 03:20:27,520
Get out of here.

4208
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:29,940
That's fucking right.

4209
03:20:32,200 --> 03:20:33,920
Oh, yeah, what you gonna do?

4210
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:35,120
You're stationary.

4211
03:20:36,940 --> 03:20:38,360
Oh, okay, I can hit that too.

4212
03:20:38,540 --> 03:20:38,840
Okay.

4213
03:20:39,560 --> 03:20:41,640
Now that I know, I can basically hit...

4214
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:43,320
Okay, I can basically hit every projectile.

4215
03:20:43,720 --> 03:20:45,480
I can reflect all projectiles.

4216
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:46,140
Now I know that.

4217
03:20:46,780 --> 03:20:47,820
It took me a while.

4218
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:50,700
It only took me three hours to figure that out.

4219
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:51,400
Guys.

4220
03:20:53,460 --> 03:20:54,860
Just three hours.

4221
03:20:55,220 --> 03:20:56,260
No big deal.

4222
03:21:01,630 --> 03:21:02,690
Where do I go?

4223
03:21:02,750 --> 03:21:03,330
Oh, this way.

4224
03:21:04,490 --> 03:21:04,730
Right?

4225
03:21:06,830 --> 03:21:07,390
No?

4226
03:21:10,030 --> 03:21:13,030
Where did it lock me up?

4227
03:21:14,110 --> 03:21:15,010
Can I go left?

4228
03:21:15,190 --> 03:21:16,070
I just want to be sure.

4229
03:21:16,290 --> 03:21:16,950
Okay, I go left.

4230
03:21:21,730 --> 03:21:22,290
Alright.

4231
03:21:24,730 --> 03:21:27,190
Oh, I have one shot now.

4232
03:21:27,330 --> 03:21:28,230
Nice, I'm strong.

4233
03:21:30,250 --> 03:21:32,030
I'm so fucking strong.

4234
03:21:35,870 --> 03:21:36,550
Alright.

4235
03:21:36,850 --> 03:21:37,590
Off we go.

4236
03:21:37,630 --> 03:21:38,130
Oh, shortcut!

4237
03:21:40,890 --> 03:21:41,950
Yay, shortcut!

4238
03:21:44,330 --> 03:21:45,350
Anything here?

4239
03:21:45,590 --> 03:21:47,470
There's so much...

4240
03:21:47,470 --> 03:21:48,790
So many pathways!

4241
03:21:50,030 --> 03:21:51,350
Where do I go?

4242
03:21:52,750 --> 03:21:53,950
Okay, guys.

4243
03:21:56,110 --> 03:21:57,070
Do I...

4244
03:21:58,170 --> 03:21:59,850
Okay, there's like...

4245
03:21:59,850 --> 03:22:01,350
There's like something here.

4246
03:22:03,250 --> 03:22:05,750
I don't know if I go through here.

4247
03:22:06,750 --> 03:22:07,230
Like...

4248
03:22:07,230 --> 03:22:08,570
Is it worth going through this tunnel?

4249
03:22:09,050 --> 03:22:09,990
Oh, well, too late.

4250
03:22:13,770 --> 03:22:15,830
It was not worth going through that tunnel.

4251
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:16,650
Well...

4252
03:22:22,490 --> 03:22:25,230
Yes, it wasn't worth it.

4253
03:22:25,410 --> 03:22:27,210
What shortcut did I unlock?

4254
03:22:28,730 --> 03:22:32,890
What the fuck was the shortcut that I unlocked just then?

4255
03:22:39,900 --> 03:22:41,420
Is it this shortcut?

4256
03:22:45,240 --> 03:22:47,440
Which shortcut did I unlock?

4257
03:22:47,820 --> 03:22:49,160
Which one?

4258
03:22:49,160 --> 03:22:49,340
Oh, man!

4259
03:22:50,660 --> 03:22:52,660
Oh, did I miss?

4260
03:22:55,560 --> 03:22:57,500
Oh, my God.

4261
03:22:58,120 --> 03:23:00,700
The fireball didn't hit.

4262
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:04,040
I was like, wait.

4263
03:23:04,180 --> 03:23:06,320
I thought I was supposed to unlock it.

4264
03:23:07,440 --> 03:23:09,480
You little fucking shithead.

4265
03:23:10,820 --> 03:23:11,740
Fucking cry.

4266
03:23:13,100 --> 03:23:13,660
Okay.

4267
03:23:14,540 --> 03:23:16,720
Alright, let's do this again.

4268
03:23:20,300 --> 03:23:21,260
Alright, uppies.

4269
03:23:24,060 --> 03:23:24,540
Uppies!

4270
03:23:27,460 --> 03:23:29,340
Okay, and then we go...

4271
03:23:29,340 --> 03:23:30,240
This way.

4272
03:23:31,660 --> 03:23:32,620
And then...

4273
03:23:32,620 --> 03:23:33,440
This way.

4274
03:23:34,620 --> 03:23:37,400
And I'm just gonna wait here and...

4275
03:23:37,400 --> 03:23:38,140
Do this.

4276
03:23:40,440 --> 03:23:41,340
There we go.

4277
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:42,980
Now we unlock the sh- I was like wondering.

4278
03:23:43,100 --> 03:23:45,140
I was like, that had to be the shortcut I just unlocked.

4279
03:23:46,140 --> 03:23:47,420
I was so confused.

4280
03:23:48,480 --> 03:23:49,180
Fucking...

4281
03:23:49,180 --> 03:23:49,700
Get over here.

4282
03:23:50,140 --> 03:23:52,160
Oh, my God, you little shit.

4283
03:23:56,270 --> 03:23:57,250
Oh, my God.

4284
03:23:57,290 --> 03:23:57,990
Where am I?

4285
03:23:58,650 --> 03:23:59,230
Wait!

4286
03:23:59,410 --> 03:24:00,050
Pray time!

4287
03:24:01,870 --> 03:24:02,330
Wait.

4288
03:24:04,050 --> 03:24:04,070
Crocod?

4289
03:24:05,150 --> 03:24:05,850
Crocod?

4290
03:24:07,570 --> 03:24:09,190
Crocod, are you okay?

4291
03:24:11,910 --> 03:24:12,610
Crocod?

4292
03:24:13,870 --> 03:24:14,470
Hello?

4293
03:24:14,470 --> 03:24:14,810
Hello?

4294
03:24:20,100 --> 03:24:22,230
Crocod no respond.

4295
03:24:23,330 --> 03:24:26,930
Crocod doesn't wanna respond to me.

4296
03:24:30,610 --> 03:24:33,970
I don't think Crocod's alive, guys.

4297
03:24:39,670 --> 03:24:40,920
Okay, three hits.

4298
03:24:40,960 --> 03:24:41,480
That's good.

4299
03:24:45,330 --> 03:24:46,360
Where go?

4300
03:24:46,360 --> 03:24:47,620
Go where?

4301
03:24:48,820 --> 03:24:50,000
I'm confused.

4302
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:52,580
Oh, here we go.

4303
03:24:54,300 --> 03:24:55,480
Get over here.

4304
03:24:56,320 --> 03:24:57,160
Nice.

4305
03:25:00,280 --> 03:25:01,940
Okay, three hits.

4306
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:06,140
And a nice shortcut.

4307
03:25:06,780 --> 03:25:07,200
Shortcut.

4308
03:25:10,100 --> 03:25:11,020
Yay!

4309
03:25:11,440 --> 03:25:11,900
Custody!

4310
03:25:11,900 --> 03:25:11,980
Yay!

4311
03:25:14,060 --> 03:25:15,840
I'm Crocod now, you're right.

4312
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:17,120
Wait, there's another shortcut.

4313
03:25:20,660 --> 03:25:22,560
I don't see these places.

4314
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:26,620
So many shortcuts.

4315
03:25:29,720 --> 03:25:30,660
Oh, this way.

4316
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:34,140
I think there has to be like a teleportation spell.

4317
03:25:34,220 --> 03:25:36,020
Because there's so much water around here.

4318
03:25:36,560 --> 03:25:38,440
But it's like, what do I do with all that water?

4319
03:25:40,360 --> 03:25:41,720
Oh, my God, where do I go?

4320
03:25:42,340 --> 03:25:43,280
I don't know.

4321
03:25:43,540 --> 03:25:46,860
When I have too many options, I get so overwhelmed.

4322
03:25:48,520 --> 03:25:50,080
Too many options.

4323
03:25:52,580 --> 03:25:53,540
Where go?

4324
03:26:00,240 --> 03:26:02,220
Why is there so many of these plants?

4325
03:26:02,840 --> 03:26:03,080
Oh.

4326
03:26:06,460 --> 03:26:08,080
Guys, I figured out why.

4327
03:26:14,720 --> 03:26:15,480
Okay.

4328
03:26:15,480 --> 03:26:16,220
That makes sense.

4329
03:26:21,620 --> 03:26:22,780
Oh, nice.

4330
03:26:27,700 --> 03:26:28,460
Nice.

4331
03:26:29,560 --> 03:26:31,360
Don't have to do anything at all.

4332
03:26:34,080 --> 03:26:35,800
Okay, now I know why.

4333
03:26:38,120 --> 03:26:38,860
Oh, yeah.

4334
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:40,760
Thank you for the super chat.

4335
03:26:40,880 --> 03:26:41,080
Thank you.

4336
03:26:43,480 --> 03:26:45,800
My birthday was two days ago.

4337
03:26:45,920 --> 03:26:47,240
Can I get a happy birthday card?

4338
03:26:47,360 --> 03:26:48,420
Of course you can.

4339
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:51,340
Oh, it's this.

4340
03:26:53,820 --> 03:26:54,400
Okay.

4341
03:26:54,860 --> 03:26:56,720
I didn't even see that rock was breakable.

4342
03:26:57,360 --> 03:26:59,460
A happy birthday to you.

4343
03:26:59,820 --> 03:27:01,680
Happy birthday to you.

4344
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:04,580
Happy birthday, dear Small Goose.

4345
03:27:04,580 --> 03:27:06,340
Happy birthday to you.

4346
03:27:06,780 --> 03:27:07,180
Gah!

4347
03:27:08,740 --> 03:27:09,580
Thank you for the super chat.

4348
03:27:09,640 --> 03:27:10,440
Thank you, thank you.

4349
03:27:10,440 --> 03:27:12,420
Okay, now I should be able to break that.

4350
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:14,980
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

4351
03:27:15,100 --> 03:27:15,900
Thank you, thank you.

4352
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,860
Not Togi rubbing the salt on the wound.

4353
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:21,400
What?

4354
03:27:25,460 --> 03:27:26,540
Does it hit all the way there?

4355
03:27:26,640 --> 03:27:27,400
Oh, it does!

4356
03:27:27,480 --> 03:27:27,880
Nice.

4357
03:27:29,020 --> 03:27:29,820
It was worth it.

4358
03:27:32,120 --> 03:27:32,520
Gah!

4359
03:27:36,420 --> 03:27:36,780
Okay.

4360
03:27:37,920 --> 03:27:39,520
Wait, is there anything else?

4361
03:27:42,040 --> 03:27:42,920
What the fuck?

4362
03:27:44,540 --> 03:27:45,660
Anything here?

4363
03:27:46,220 --> 03:27:47,120
Where am I?

4364
03:27:47,640 --> 03:27:48,600
Oh, there's another plant.

4365
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:50,240
Wait.

4366
03:27:50,980 --> 03:27:52,340
Okay, there's a shortcut.

4367
03:27:52,580 --> 03:27:53,380
Okay, I was gonna say.

4368
03:27:54,720 --> 03:27:56,760
Everything's blurring together, guys.

4369
03:27:59,600 --> 03:28:00,320
Consume.

4370
03:28:00,320 --> 03:28:00,600
Consume.

4371
03:28:02,960 --> 03:28:04,320
Everything's blurring together.

4372
03:28:04,760 --> 03:28:06,520
I don't remember where is what.

4373
03:28:06,620 --> 03:28:07,460
Oh, there's the horn!

4374
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:10,540
I got the horn!

4375
03:28:11,540 --> 03:28:13,040
Mata would be pleased.

4376
03:28:14,340 --> 03:28:14,940
Nice.

4377
03:28:17,100 --> 03:28:18,400
Oh, so that's where you're like...

4378
03:28:18,860 --> 03:28:20,040
That's what happened.

4379
03:28:21,800 --> 03:28:22,580
Where do I go?

4380
03:28:23,800 --> 03:28:25,240
I wanna go here.

4381
03:28:26,900 --> 03:28:28,280
Where do I go now?

4382
03:28:30,320 --> 03:28:31,000
Wait, what?

4383
03:28:31,940 --> 03:28:33,320
I can't open this.

4384
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:36,220
Huh?

4385
03:28:37,540 --> 03:28:39,320
I don't go fast enough.

4386
03:28:42,400 --> 03:28:44,360
I'm not fast enough for that.

4387
03:28:45,600 --> 03:28:46,180
Confused.

4388
03:28:51,370 --> 03:28:53,730
Alright, everything's a shortcut if you think about it.

4389
03:28:56,930 --> 03:28:57,890
There we go.

4390
03:28:58,630 --> 03:29:00,030
Yeah, but how do I do this?

4391
03:29:01,050 --> 03:29:02,210
This one.

4392
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:07,340
Oh, I am fast enough!

4393
03:29:07,400 --> 03:29:07,940
I'm gaming.

4394
03:29:09,340 --> 03:29:11,060
I am fast enough.

4395
03:29:12,920 --> 03:29:13,880
That's right.

4396
03:29:14,220 --> 03:29:15,860
I don't need to invest in speed.

4397
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:18,320
I'll always be fast enough.

4398
03:29:23,560 --> 03:29:24,320
Okay, swing.

4399
03:29:25,200 --> 03:29:25,880
Swing.

4400
03:29:26,240 --> 03:29:27,640
Wait, why is that not anything?

4401
03:29:30,680 --> 03:29:31,760
Anything for this?

4402
03:29:31,760 --> 03:29:33,180
No?

4403
03:29:33,640 --> 03:29:34,040
Okay.

4404
03:29:35,300 --> 03:29:36,300
But where do I go now?

4405
03:29:39,580 --> 03:29:40,980
Where do I go now?

4406
03:29:42,180 --> 03:29:43,580
Pro-key confused.

4407
03:29:45,500 --> 03:29:46,620
Do I go home?

4408
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:48,760
I guess I go home, right?

4409
03:29:50,580 --> 03:29:52,240
But where is home?

4410
03:29:53,340 --> 03:29:54,080
Mother.

4411
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:55,200
Back to mother.

4412
03:29:55,720 --> 03:29:56,180
You're right.

4413
03:29:57,460 --> 03:29:58,540
Stupid babies.

4414
03:29:59,560 --> 03:30:00,880
Oh my god.

4415
03:30:00,940 --> 03:30:03,180
There's a lever here that I can't open.

4416
03:30:05,280 --> 03:30:06,580
What's the point?

4417
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:09,220
What the fuck is the point?

4418
03:30:12,300 --> 03:30:13,020
Okay.

4419
03:30:14,280 --> 03:30:14,940
Shortcut.

4420
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:18,040
Oh, I did open a shortcut!

4421
03:30:19,180 --> 03:30:19,560
Oh!

4422
03:30:20,920 --> 03:30:22,200
Hello, I found you.

4423
03:30:22,220 --> 03:30:22,700
Your horn.

4424
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:26,260
My horn!

4425
03:30:26,260 --> 03:30:28,620
Thank you, feathery friend.

4426
03:30:43,240 --> 03:30:45,620
Sing for me, mother.

4427
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:47,740
Sing for me!

4428
03:30:51,880 --> 03:30:52,840
Thank

4429
03:31:16,960 --> 03:31:18,200
you, mother.

4430
03:31:20,380 --> 03:31:20,580
Yay!

4431
03:31:21,520 --> 03:31:22,200
Wait, what happened?

4432
03:31:22,300 --> 03:31:23,160
I closed my eyes.

4433
03:31:27,240 --> 03:31:28,660
Wait, what opened?

4434
03:31:28,800 --> 03:31:30,160
I actually closed my eyes.

4435
03:31:30,420 --> 03:31:31,280
I don't know.

4436
03:31:32,040 --> 03:31:32,040
Wait,

4437
03:31:35,480 --> 03:31:36,300
guys.

4438
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:38,340
I'm actually serious.

4439
03:31:38,580 --> 03:31:39,660
I closed my eyes.

4440
03:31:40,300 --> 03:31:42,600
The door blocked by the vines?

4441
03:31:43,080 --> 03:31:44,700
The fuck is that?

4442
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:48,920
Wait, where is that?

4443
03:31:48,920 --> 03:31:52,140
I remember no dungeon.

4444
03:31:55,200 --> 03:31:56,480
Wait.

4445
03:31:58,040 --> 03:31:59,560
Oh, guys.

4446
03:32:00,700 --> 03:32:02,680
Guys, I'm confused.

4447
03:32:04,220 --> 03:32:05,700
I actually don't know.

4448
03:32:08,640 --> 03:32:11,620
What is that?

4449
03:32:13,380 --> 03:32:14,240
No elk.

4450
03:32:14,240 --> 03:32:14,360
No elk.

4451
03:32:17,060 --> 03:32:18,720
Guys, I actually don't know.

4452
03:32:20,040 --> 03:32:21,700
I closed my eyes.

4453
03:32:21,900 --> 03:32:23,480
I don't know where...

4454
03:32:24,220 --> 03:32:26,260
I don't know where to go.

4455
03:32:29,660 --> 03:32:32,060
Oh, the door to the overworld?

4456
03:32:34,060 --> 03:32:35,580
Are there any doors here?

4457
03:32:37,820 --> 03:32:40,480
Oh my god, where am I?

4458
03:32:40,480 --> 03:32:40,880
Okay.

4459
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:44,380
Oh, pray time.

4460
03:32:45,620 --> 03:32:47,100
I don't know how I got here.

4461
03:32:48,880 --> 03:32:50,500
Oh god, please.

4462
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:52,800
Oh!

4463
03:32:55,580 --> 03:32:57,100
I have two shards.

4464
03:32:57,280 --> 03:32:57,680
Two more.

4465
03:32:57,720 --> 03:32:59,200
Oh wait, that's the wrong one.

4466
03:32:59,360 --> 03:33:01,440
Wait, I need the heal one.

4467
03:33:02,420 --> 03:33:03,560
Are you fucking serious?

4468
03:33:04,500 --> 03:33:05,800
Where am I?

4469
03:33:10,480 --> 03:33:12,320
Where am I?

4470
03:33:15,320 --> 03:33:18,800
Oh no, I don't know where I am.

4471
03:33:20,260 --> 03:33:21,800
Where am I at?

4472
03:33:22,820 --> 03:33:24,580
Grokey's so confused.

4473
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:30,780
Grokey confused.

4474
03:33:33,300 --> 03:33:36,540
Grokey wants to find out where she is.

4475
03:33:40,380 --> 03:33:45,940
Where am I?

4476
03:33:51,340 --> 03:33:52,800
Oh my god, I'm going downstairs.

4477
03:33:53,620 --> 03:33:54,980
Oh, is it this?

4478
03:33:56,660 --> 03:33:58,040
Oh, I found it!

4479
03:33:58,920 --> 03:33:59,940
I did it!

4480
03:34:00,140 --> 03:34:01,040
On accident.

4481
03:34:04,480 --> 03:34:05,800
Let's go.

4482
03:34:06,200 --> 03:34:07,220
Grokey's smart.

4483
03:34:08,880 --> 03:34:09,520
Hello.

4484
03:34:09,880 --> 03:34:10,480
Oh, a little birdie.

4485
03:34:10,480 --> 03:34:12,200
Come cage, save me.

4486
03:34:12,860 --> 03:34:14,520
Big frog lock Grunt here.

4487
03:34:14,660 --> 03:34:15,920
Grunt clever too much.

4488
03:34:16,020 --> 03:34:17,840
Oh my god, he speaks my language.

4489
03:34:18,900 --> 03:34:21,180
Grunt have good ideas and big frog no like.

4490
03:34:21,860 --> 03:34:22,900
Grunt know what wear.

4491
03:34:23,220 --> 03:34:24,380
Big frog mask.

4492
03:34:24,840 --> 03:34:26,540
Big frog know except Grunt is individual.

4493
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:32,700
Oh my god, he's just like me for real for real.

4494
03:34:37,320 --> 03:34:39,020
Wait, what do I do?

4495
03:34:41,120 --> 03:34:42,000
Wait, what?

4496
03:34:48,830 --> 03:34:50,550
Oh, I burn this.

4497
03:34:50,930 --> 03:34:52,550
I forgot that's like cobwebs.

4498
03:34:52,810 --> 03:34:54,630
They look like, I don't know why.

4499
03:34:55,010 --> 03:34:57,370
In my head, it doesn't seem like cobwebs.

4500
03:34:57,470 --> 03:34:59,430
So I keep forgetting I can...

4501
03:35:00,250 --> 03:35:02,970
I keep forgetting that I can just like...

4502
03:35:03,530 --> 03:35:04,710
Open that up.

4503
03:35:05,070 --> 03:35:05,730
With fire.

4504
03:35:08,050 --> 03:35:09,170
The fuck is that?

4505
03:35:09,210 --> 03:35:09,970
Is that big frog?

4506
03:35:09,970 --> 03:35:10,170
What?

4507
03:35:10,390 --> 03:35:11,610
Oi, reaper.

4508
03:35:12,990 --> 03:35:14,230
What are you doing here?

4509
03:35:15,390 --> 03:35:18,890
Why, my Grunt said there are some shady crows causing trouble in the ruins.

4510
03:35:19,330 --> 03:35:20,590
I'll come see for myself.

4511
03:35:21,610 --> 03:35:22,650
You're here for my soul?

4512
03:35:22,770 --> 03:35:23,770
Then tough luck.

4513
03:35:24,730 --> 03:35:26,690
I earn my power fair and square.

4514
03:35:27,370 --> 03:35:30,100
I'm just thriving in the system your lords created.

4515
03:35:37,870 --> 03:35:38,790
That's right.

4516
03:35:38,790 --> 03:35:40,310
I don't care.

4517
03:35:42,570 --> 03:35:44,330
I hunger for souls.

4518
03:35:44,530 --> 03:35:45,910
Oh, it's another one of those guys.

4519
03:35:47,390 --> 03:35:48,910
What you doing in my swamp?

4520
03:35:53,260 --> 03:35:55,380
Oh my god, I hate these children.

4521
03:35:56,600 --> 03:35:58,100
They're so annoying.

4522
03:36:02,430 --> 03:36:03,930
There we go, get over here.

4523
03:36:04,530 --> 03:36:06,490
That's right, you think crying is gonna fucking...

4524
03:36:07,470 --> 03:36:09,510
Wait, I can't do anything here.

4525
03:36:12,490 --> 03:36:13,810
Crying is not gonna save you.

4526
03:36:14,310 --> 03:36:15,450
Same with you.

4527
03:36:16,570 --> 03:36:17,430
Oh, so it doesn't matter.

4528
03:36:17,470 --> 03:36:18,350
Oh wait, no, it's here.

4529
03:36:18,570 --> 03:36:19,710
Okay, I didn't see that.

4530
03:36:19,830 --> 03:36:20,590
That's so tiny.

4531
03:36:23,070 --> 03:36:23,590
Time.

4532
03:36:25,870 --> 03:36:26,390
Okay.

4533
03:36:28,690 --> 03:36:28,950
Huh?

4534
03:36:30,650 --> 03:36:31,070
Huh?

4535
03:36:37,730 --> 03:36:38,250
Confused.

4536
03:36:40,730 --> 03:36:41,130
What?

4537
03:36:41,130 --> 03:36:41,330
What?

4538
03:36:49,410 --> 03:36:51,850
Okay, now I don't have any powers left.

4539
03:36:55,030 --> 03:36:55,290
Huh?

4540
03:37:01,790 --> 03:37:02,390
Huh?

4541
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:09,640
Huh?

4542
03:37:12,980 --> 03:37:14,180
Cookie confused.

4543
03:37:21,690 --> 03:37:23,390
Oh, there's another one.

4544
03:37:23,470 --> 03:37:25,770
Okay, maybe this one is actually gonna work.

4545
03:37:26,150 --> 03:37:26,830
Oh, okay.

4546
03:37:27,150 --> 03:37:28,130
I was supposed to go here.

4547
03:37:28,950 --> 03:37:30,090
Plant my seed.

4548
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:35,800
Kill this guy first.

4549
03:37:37,340 --> 03:37:37,900
Oh shit.

4550
03:37:40,580 --> 03:37:41,600
Alright, nice.

4551
03:37:42,480 --> 03:37:43,580
I was supposed to go here.

4552
03:37:45,800 --> 03:37:46,780
That's so dumb.

4553
03:37:49,340 --> 03:37:51,900
How the fuck was I supposed to know I was supposed to go here?

4554
03:37:59,220 --> 03:38:00,880
Now I need to burn that.

4555
03:38:02,280 --> 03:38:02,880
Yay!

4556
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:05,520
Oh, fuck.

4557
03:38:05,620 --> 03:38:06,180
Okay, don't worry.

4558
03:38:06,460 --> 03:38:07,300
I got the strat.

4559
03:38:07,860 --> 03:38:10,700
I hit this, and then everything dies.

4560
03:38:11,160 --> 03:38:12,040
Okay, I missed.

4561
03:38:12,360 --> 03:38:15,000
But like, I hit this...

4562
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:16,100
And then everything...

4563
03:38:16,100 --> 03:38:16,380
Ow.

4564
03:38:18,960 --> 03:38:20,700
Okay, I'm not gonna be fancy.

4565
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:22,660
I just kill.

4566
03:38:24,560 --> 03:38:26,120
Okay, but everything dies.

4567
03:38:26,880 --> 03:38:28,120
Okay, nevermind.

4568
03:38:28,120 --> 03:38:30,080
Guys, I'm gonna stop doing that now.

4569
03:38:31,540 --> 03:38:32,720
I've learned my lesson.

4570
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:35,500
If it happens, it happens, you know?

4571
03:38:35,700 --> 03:38:37,040
If it happens, it happens.

4572
03:38:37,740 --> 03:38:40,120
Oh my god, it's those little shitheads.

4573
03:38:44,940 --> 03:38:46,060
Get over here.

4574
03:38:46,880 --> 03:38:48,020
Crying onion children.

4575
03:38:49,020 --> 03:38:49,620
There we go.

4576
03:38:51,760 --> 03:38:52,240
Yay!

4577
03:38:54,200 --> 03:38:55,420
Alright, crow man.

4578
03:38:55,420 --> 03:38:55,480
Crow man.

4579
03:38:58,120 --> 03:38:59,670
Locked in a grimy dungeon.

4580
03:39:00,480 --> 03:39:02,220
Not the way I wanted to go.

4581
03:39:03,640 --> 03:39:04,220
Goodbye.

4582
03:39:05,020 --> 03:39:05,520
Goodbye.

4583
03:39:06,600 --> 03:39:07,040
Goodbye.

4584
03:39:08,420 --> 03:39:08,980
Goodbye.

4585
03:39:11,600 --> 03:39:12,560
Okay, four.

4586
03:39:13,200 --> 03:39:14,920
I have to save four crows?

4587
03:39:15,220 --> 03:39:16,880
Why do all these crows keep dying?

4588
03:39:22,630 --> 03:39:24,400
Is the frog gonna talk to me?

4589
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:25,800
Or is he mad?

4590
03:39:28,900 --> 03:39:29,340
Those children.

4591
03:39:30,380 --> 03:39:32,100
They know it's not their day.

4592
03:39:32,480 --> 03:39:33,180
Look at that.

4593
03:39:33,980 --> 03:39:34,580
See?

4594
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:37,300
Those kids know it's not their day.

4595
03:39:39,440 --> 03:39:41,540
Where else do I go?

4596
03:39:49,710 --> 03:39:51,390
I'm so confused.

4597
03:39:56,640 --> 03:39:58,500
I'm so confused.

4598
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:06,860
Where go?

4599
03:40:10,320 --> 03:40:12,060
Where do I go?

4600
03:40:14,140 --> 03:40:14,800
Oh, here.

4601
03:40:17,860 --> 03:40:18,220
Oh shit.

4602
03:40:19,100 --> 03:40:20,060
Oh shit.

4603
03:40:22,220 --> 03:40:23,940
Don't worry, I'm fast enough.

4604
03:40:25,260 --> 03:40:25,980
See?

4605
03:40:26,260 --> 03:40:26,800
Look at that.

4606
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:29,640
I knew I was fast enough.

4607
03:40:30,940 --> 03:40:33,400
Oh wait, I just make it.

4608
03:40:40,880 --> 03:40:44,360
I have to get both of them.

4609
03:40:44,360 --> 03:40:45,920
There we go.

4610
03:40:49,500 --> 03:40:50,300
Shion!

4611
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:52,340
Come with me.

4612
03:40:58,070 --> 03:40:58,990
Oh, there we go.

4613
03:41:01,850 --> 03:41:03,070
I am speed.

4614
03:41:05,030 --> 03:41:07,110
I don't need no speed upgrade.

4615
03:41:08,150 --> 03:41:09,530
I'm fast as fuck.

4616
03:41:12,330 --> 03:41:13,110
Woah!

4617
03:41:13,370 --> 03:41:13,690
Woah!

4618
03:41:15,970 --> 03:41:17,390
Woah, calm down!

4619
03:41:17,390 --> 03:41:19,650
Calm down!

4620
03:41:21,470 --> 03:41:22,070
Unlock.

4621
03:41:22,770 --> 03:41:23,810
Where am I?

4622
03:41:24,370 --> 03:41:26,090
Where the fuck am I now?

4623
03:41:28,950 --> 03:41:30,610
Where did I come from?

4624
03:41:34,310 --> 03:41:36,070
This is a big ass dungeon.

4625
03:41:38,970 --> 03:41:41,370
I like how this roll is actually faster.

4626
03:41:43,210 --> 03:41:43,890
I think?

4627
03:41:44,130 --> 03:41:44,810
Or is it placebo?

4628
03:41:44,950 --> 03:41:45,850
Actually, I don't know now.

4629
03:41:45,850 --> 03:41:46,830
Hahaha!

4630
03:41:48,370 --> 03:41:50,110
Actually, maybe it's not.

4631
03:41:50,330 --> 03:41:51,990
Maybe it's the same speed.

4632
03:41:52,470 --> 03:41:54,210
Now that I look at it...

4633
03:41:54,210 --> 03:41:55,990
Guys, I don't think it's faster.

4634
03:41:59,410 --> 03:42:00,930
I can't tell actually.

4635
03:42:07,020 --> 03:42:08,860
Oh, there's another dead crow.

4636
03:42:10,000 --> 03:42:10,460
No!

4637
03:42:14,030 --> 03:42:15,210
Oh, fucking hell!

4638
03:42:15,270 --> 03:42:16,350
What the fuck is that?

4639
03:42:19,320 --> 03:42:21,160
There's another boss?

4640
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:22,460
Oh, fuck!

4641
03:42:22,760 --> 03:42:23,800
Oh my god!

4642
03:42:23,860 --> 03:42:25,140
He just hits me!

4643
03:42:30,320 --> 03:42:31,080
Bro!

4644
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:33,400
He just hammers me!

4645
03:42:36,720 --> 03:42:38,300
What do I do?

4646
03:42:39,580 --> 03:42:41,100
Oh my god!

4647
03:42:41,140 --> 03:42:42,900
Now there's another one!

4648
03:42:44,140 --> 03:42:45,740
Guys, I don't...

4649
03:42:45,740 --> 03:42:46,920
Guys, it ain't looking so good.

4650
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:52,420
Guys, it ain't looking so good for Doki right now.

4651
03:42:55,990 --> 03:42:57,030
Oh, thank god.

4652
03:42:57,090 --> 03:42:57,350
Okay.

4653
03:42:57,710 --> 03:42:58,990
I'm like 1 HP.

4654
03:43:03,660 --> 03:43:06,040
Oh, it ain't looking so good for Doki!

4655
03:43:08,740 --> 03:43:09,300
Oh!

4656
03:43:09,740 --> 03:43:11,020
I thought he got me.

4657
03:43:12,260 --> 03:43:12,820
Okay.

4658
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:14,060
I got you!

4659
03:43:16,220 --> 03:43:17,760
Assault, thank you for the super chat!

4660
03:43:17,760 --> 03:43:19,000
Thank you, thank you!

4661
03:43:23,100 --> 03:43:23,800
Hey,

4662
03:43:30,220 --> 03:43:31,960
don't speak of the lord like that!

4663
03:43:33,380 --> 03:43:34,540
He is lord!

4664
03:43:35,420 --> 03:43:36,040
For a reason!

4665
03:43:44,200 --> 03:43:44,540
Okay.

4666
03:43:46,000 --> 03:43:47,240
Off we go!

4667
03:43:49,340 --> 03:43:50,720
This game is so addicting.

4668
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:52,320
I wanna stop.

4669
03:43:52,480 --> 03:43:54,100
I have another long stream tomorrow.

4670
03:43:55,080 --> 03:43:55,980
Planting a seed.

4671
03:43:59,580 --> 03:44:00,100
Whoa!

4672
03:44:02,220 --> 03:44:02,960
Don't mind me.

4673
03:44:03,180 --> 03:44:04,320
Just out for a swim.

4674
03:44:05,020 --> 03:44:06,040
Can you join me, Reaper?

4675
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:07,480
No?

4676
03:44:09,660 --> 03:44:10,960
Probably a wise decision.

4677
03:44:11,200 --> 03:44:12,300
If I'm being honest...

4678
03:44:12,300 --> 03:44:13,880
I was gonna try and drown you.

4679
03:44:14,460 --> 03:44:15,980
See, I'm being honest.

4680
03:44:16,320 --> 03:44:17,660
Surely that counts for something.

4681
03:44:17,660 --> 03:44:19,120
What do you say?

4682
03:44:19,780 --> 03:44:20,260
Truce?

4683
03:44:23,740 --> 03:44:24,420
That's right.

4684
03:44:24,500 --> 03:44:25,120
No truce.

4685
03:44:25,660 --> 03:44:26,440
Fight against water.

4686
03:44:26,580 --> 03:44:27,580
Surely that's the way.

4687
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:36,080
Oh, this...

4688
03:44:36,080 --> 03:44:37,660
I don't know how I'm gonna do that one.

4689
03:44:38,840 --> 03:44:40,360
That's way too fast.

4690
03:44:40,840 --> 03:44:41,100
Right?

4691
03:44:47,970 --> 03:44:49,510
Yeah, I can't get a TP.

4692
03:44:49,930 --> 03:44:51,230
I can't make it to the other side.

4693
03:44:52,250 --> 03:44:54,410
I was thinking like, yeah, that's way too fast.

4694
03:44:56,450 --> 03:44:57,290
Wait, no, I have a key.

4695
03:44:57,750 --> 03:44:58,990
I don't have a key.

4696
03:45:09,580 --> 03:45:11,900
Maybe I'm gonna go for the other door first.

4697
03:45:12,240 --> 03:45:12,620
Actually.

4698
03:45:14,280 --> 03:45:15,360
Just cause I...

4699
03:45:15,360 --> 03:45:15,800
Oh no.

4700
03:45:16,580 --> 03:45:19,440
I think I should go the other door first.

4701
03:45:20,740 --> 03:45:21,260
Yeah.

4702
03:45:22,280 --> 03:45:24,060
Just cause there is an entrance here.

4703
03:45:25,480 --> 03:45:26,840
What's over here?

4704
03:45:27,880 --> 03:45:28,400
Swing!

4705
03:45:33,310 --> 03:45:34,590
Oh wait, no, there is something.

4706
03:45:36,070 --> 03:45:37,430
What's over here?

4707
03:45:38,710 --> 03:45:39,830
Oh, another lever.

4708
03:45:43,840 --> 03:45:44,220
Okay.

4709
03:45:45,780 --> 03:45:46,580
I hate...

4710
03:45:46,580 --> 03:45:48,480
I think the furnace level is the most annoying.

4711
03:45:48,720 --> 03:45:49,440
That's for sure.

4712
03:45:49,820 --> 03:45:50,340
For now.

4713
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:51,980
The gloops.

4714
03:45:52,380 --> 03:45:56,400
I hated the gloops and that stupid plague doctor boss.

4715
03:45:56,560 --> 03:45:57,320
Fuck that guy.

4716
03:45:59,720 --> 03:46:01,300
Oh, you just wait.

4717
03:46:01,400 --> 03:46:02,260
Oh no.

4718
03:46:02,260 --> 03:46:04,260
Oh no.

4719
03:46:06,940 --> 03:46:07,100
Oh no.

4720
03:46:07,100 --> 03:46:09,220
What do you mean by that?

4721
03:46:10,780 --> 03:46:12,020
For now.

4722
03:46:12,400 --> 03:46:13,320
Oh no.

4723
03:46:19,760 --> 03:46:20,720
Anything here?

4724
03:46:21,160 --> 03:46:24,020
There's like all these TP areas, but I can't use it.

4725
03:46:28,560 --> 03:46:29,260
Hey, huh?

4726
03:46:31,720 --> 03:46:34,780
I guess it has to be the TP, right?

4727
03:46:36,640 --> 03:46:37,540
Is that a threat?

4728
03:46:37,540 --> 03:46:37,640
Is that a threat?

4729
03:46:41,900 --> 03:46:42,700
What's this?

4730
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:44,380
Oh, this is not a shortcut.

4731
03:46:44,420 --> 03:46:45,300
I should not go up there.

4732
03:46:48,440 --> 03:46:48,840
Oh!

4733
03:46:49,920 --> 03:46:50,800
That's how I get it.

4734
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:51,120
Okay.

4735
03:46:52,100 --> 03:46:52,500
Nice.

4736
03:46:53,220 --> 03:46:53,820
Nice haul.

4737
03:46:59,020 --> 03:46:59,420
Okay.

4738
03:46:59,920 --> 03:47:01,280
Yeah, I should not drop down.

4739
03:47:02,280 --> 03:47:04,300
I don't want to walk all the way here again.

4740
03:47:05,560 --> 03:47:06,420
Okay.

4741
03:47:09,730 --> 03:47:11,610
What do you have here?

4742
03:47:12,890 --> 03:47:14,070
More ladders?

4743
03:47:17,200 --> 03:47:18,920
Oh my god.

4744
03:47:19,340 --> 03:47:20,940
That's what I've always wanted.

4745
03:47:21,320 --> 03:47:22,280
More ladders.

4746
03:47:23,520 --> 03:47:24,020
Shortcut.

4747
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:28,600
Oh my god.

4748
03:47:28,640 --> 03:47:29,600
A dream come true.

4749
03:47:31,380 --> 03:47:32,560
What's here?

4750
03:47:33,580 --> 03:47:34,340
What's here?

4751
03:47:36,900 --> 03:47:38,540
Wait, what is here?

4752
03:47:41,180 --> 03:47:42,540
Where the fuck- Oh!

4753
03:47:43,800 --> 03:47:45,080
I'm so smart.

4754
03:47:45,640 --> 03:47:46,660
And I was like, what's here?

4755
03:47:46,840 --> 03:47:47,700
I did it.

4756
03:47:49,040 --> 03:47:53,080
You equip it from the- Oh my god, giant hammer.

4757
03:47:53,780 --> 03:47:54,900
1.2, dat.

4758
03:47:55,060 --> 03:47:55,480
Wow.

4759
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:01,120
How do I do this?

4760
03:48:05,080 --> 03:48:05,260
Wait.

4761
03:48:06,920 --> 03:48:07,400
No.

4762
03:48:09,800 --> 03:48:10,580
Oh my god.

4763
03:48:10,720 --> 03:48:11,240
Giant hammer.

4764
03:48:13,220 --> 03:48:13,700
Okay.

4765
03:48:13,960 --> 03:48:15,420
What do I do with giant hammer then?

4766
03:48:18,280 --> 03:48:19,520
Wait, can I throw it?

4767
03:48:22,600 --> 03:48:23,680
No, I can't.

4768
03:48:25,080 --> 03:48:26,500
Wait, can I bash it?

4769
03:48:27,980 --> 03:48:29,060
No, I can't.

4770
03:48:30,560 --> 03:48:33,740
No, I can't even break- What the fuck's a point?

4771
03:48:38,660 --> 03:48:39,060
Okay.

4772
03:48:45,530 --> 03:48:48,290
What do I do with this giant hammer?

4773
03:48:54,950 --> 03:48:56,630
It looks cool.

4774
03:48:59,810 --> 03:49:01,110
But where

4775
03:49:05,160 --> 03:49:09,120
- Oh, it's here.

4776
03:49:09,940 --> 03:49:13,020
That's what has to let me TP, I'm pretty sure.

4777
03:49:16,470 --> 03:49:18,970
I'm pretty sure that's what makes me TP.

4778
03:49:18,970 --> 03:49:22,650
But like, I don't know- I need to figure out how to get there.

4779
03:49:26,510 --> 03:49:28,210
Is this- Wait.

4780
03:49:29,090 --> 03:49:29,950
Wait a minute.

4781
03:49:32,070 --> 03:49:33,250
Okay, nevermind.

4782
03:49:33,390 --> 03:49:33,990
Wait a minute.

4783
03:49:36,210 --> 03:49:37,490
Okay, nevermind.

4784
03:49:42,730 --> 03:49:43,570
It's this!

4785
03:49:43,890 --> 03:49:44,870
This thing here!

4786
03:49:48,410 --> 03:49:50,030
It's right here!

4787
03:49:54,570 --> 03:49:55,310
Where'd it go?

4788
03:49:59,730 --> 03:50:03,170
Yeah, but I can't- I'm not fast enough for this one.

4789
03:50:04,610 --> 03:50:06,890
This one, I'm not fast enough.

4790
03:50:11,960 --> 03:50:12,600
No.

4791
03:50:16,040 --> 03:50:17,740
I'm not fast enough.

4792
03:50:17,820 --> 03:50:18,560
I'm too slow.

4793
03:50:18,920 --> 03:50:20,040
I'm too slow, girl.

4794
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:20,600
Be slow.

4795
03:50:27,080 --> 03:50:27,480
Where'd it go?

4796
03:50:29,220 --> 03:50:31,580
I don't know where to go, guys.

4797
03:50:31,980 --> 03:50:35,560
But I don't want all the enemies to respawn just yet.

4798
03:50:42,260 --> 03:50:43,320
Where'd it go?

4799
03:50:43,960 --> 03:50:45,020
Where'd it go?

4800
03:50:46,860 --> 03:50:48,520
Where do I go?

4801
03:50:51,720 --> 03:50:52,080
Where?

4802
03:51:02,240 --> 03:51:03,660
I can't!

4803
03:51:04,420 --> 03:51:06,880
I can't light those fires, guys!

4804
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:07,980
You wanna know why?

4805
03:51:08,540 --> 03:51:10,660
Because I need TP right there.

4806
03:51:13,460 --> 03:51:15,400
I can't light this one.

4807
03:51:16,580 --> 03:51:18,240
The one down here.

4808
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:23,120
I can't light the one down here.

4809
03:51:25,180 --> 03:51:26,580
Oh, I can fall down.

4810
03:51:26,960 --> 03:51:28,140
Oh, I'm so stupid.

4811
03:51:35,420 --> 03:51:36,520
I did it.

4812
03:51:42,180 --> 03:51:42,540
I did it.

4813
03:51:42,800 --> 03:51:44,620
I didn't see it.

4814
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:13,420
What's everyone's like out there?

4815
03:52:13,680 --> 03:52:15,180
It's a mess.

4816
03:52:15,800 --> 03:52:16,780
A wasteland.

4817
03:52:16,920 --> 03:52:18,120
Oh my god, I knew it.

4818
03:52:18,380 --> 03:52:21,740
I knew those hippies were in the way.

4819
03:52:28,020 --> 03:52:33,580
I knew it.

4820
03:52:34,460 --> 03:52:36,400
I fucking knew it.

4821
03:52:37,580 --> 03:52:39,960
It sure smells bad down there.

4822
03:52:46,240 --> 03:52:48,860
Okay, let's see how this goes.

4823
03:52:49,320 --> 03:52:50,460
Oh my god!

4824
03:52:51,940 --> 03:52:53,760
Guys, it's not going so well.

4825
03:53:00,220 --> 03:53:02,640
Guys, it might not be go-

4826
03:53:11,640 --> 03:53:13,400
Alright, I'm calling that there.

4827
03:53:14,980 --> 03:53:16,680
That's a good time to call it.

4828
03:53:17,060 --> 03:53:18,040
Do I autosave?

4829
03:53:18,460 --> 03:53:19,320
It does, right?

4830
03:53:19,320 --> 03:53:19,680
Alright.

4831
03:53:21,300 --> 03:53:23,500
Crow with big hammer was not it.

4832
03:53:23,640 --> 03:53:25,440
Guys, that's fun though.

4833
03:53:25,960 --> 03:53:29,260
I think I'm like- I should be like close to finishing, right?

4834
03:53:29,400 --> 03:53:32,500
It says like, this game is like 8 hours long.

4835
03:53:32,680 --> 03:53:34,280
So like, I'm pretty sure.

4836
03:53:34,980 --> 03:53:35,300
Right?

4837
03:53:39,620 --> 03:53:41,040
But, I had fun.

4838
03:53:41,420 --> 03:53:44,740
I think this game is- Yeah, I'll finish in part 2.

4839
03:53:44,820 --> 03:53:46,340
But I do have another livestream tomorrow.

4840
03:53:46,340 --> 03:53:49,380
So I don't want to do too many livestreams in a row.

4841
03:53:49,760 --> 03:53:52,140
Just cause like, my voice is still hitting.

4842
03:53:52,660 --> 03:53:53,680
But I had a lot of fun.

4843
03:53:53,980 --> 03:53:56,740
Oh my god, I can upgrade!

4844
03:53:57,360 --> 03:53:57,800
Strength.

4845
03:54:00,260 --> 03:54:03,360
If all else fails, I'm gonna be maxed out.

4846
03:54:04,020 --> 03:54:06,960
Big strong bird man coming through.

4847
03:54:07,160 --> 03:54:07,860
That's right.

4848
03:54:08,420 --> 03:54:09,300
That's right.

4849
03:54:09,660 --> 03:54:11,080
Big strong bird.

4850
03:54:11,480 --> 03:54:13,300
Big strong crow coming in.

4851
03:54:13,300 --> 03:54:14,460
That's fucking right.

4852
03:54:14,900 --> 03:54:16,320
I'm the strength chat.

4853
03:54:16,460 --> 03:54:17,680
No defense.

4854
03:54:18,400 --> 03:54:19,480
Get juiced up.

4855
03:54:19,600 --> 03:54:20,520
That's right, you see that?

4856
03:54:22,140 --> 03:54:22,660
Bam!

4857
03:54:25,080 --> 03:54:26,860
That's right, croaky smash!

4858
03:54:27,220 --> 03:54:27,520
Haha!

4859
03:54:28,540 --> 03:54:29,480
That's fun!

4860
03:54:29,560 --> 03:54:30,700
I really enjoyed this game.

4861
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:35,820
I think like, if I didn't have a livestream tomorrow, I definitely would've streamed a lot, lot longer for sure.

4862
03:54:36,240 --> 03:54:38,720
But, I hope you guys enjoyed watching today.

4863
03:54:41,760 --> 03:54:43,040
Watching DevStore.

4864
03:54:43,700 --> 03:54:48,600
If you guys enjoyed croaky, like I said, just gonna do a little chill here.

4865
03:54:48,900 --> 03:54:49,940
But, yeah!

4866
03:54:50,260 --> 03:54:56,980
If you enjoyed croaky, I have croaky plushies, as well as two other official plushies out right now!

4867
03:54:57,680 --> 03:54:58,720
It's really helpful!

4868
03:54:59,120 --> 03:55:08,020
If you wanna support me, my stream, and potential more merch collaborations in the future, support by buying a croaky plush!

4869
03:55:08,020 --> 03:55:09,380

4870
03:55:10,440 --> 03:55:10,960
Yippee!

4871
03:55:12,200 --> 03:55:13,400
Alright, chill done.

4872
03:55:14,940 --> 03:55:15,860
I'm finished chilling.

4873
03:55:16,360 --> 03:55:17,800
Hey guys, that was really fun!

4874
03:55:17,940 --> 03:55:20,700
I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

4875
03:55:20,920 --> 03:55:24,600
It's a little different from what I usually play, but I like it.

4876
03:55:24,640 --> 03:55:26,020
I like this game a lot so far.

4877
03:55:26,900 --> 03:55:28,520
Um, I like...

4878
03:55:28,520 --> 03:55:29,560
I just... I don't know.

4879
03:55:29,640 --> 03:55:35,960
I really enjoyed the... I enjoyed the combat for sure, until they start spamming like 800 enemies on me.

4880
03:55:35,960 --> 03:55:37,920
Then I don't enjoy the combat anymore.

4881
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:41,120
But like, other than that, it's been really fun so far.

4882
03:55:42,100 --> 03:55:42,460
And...

4883
03:55:42,460 --> 03:55:44,000
Uh, and...

4884
03:55:44,000 --> 03:55:46,300
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

4885
03:55:46,560 --> 03:55:47,180
Posture check.

4886
03:55:47,420 --> 03:55:49,400
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4887
03:55:49,580 --> 03:55:52,680
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

4888
03:55:52,700 --> 03:55:54,240
I'm gonna try and finish part two.

4889
03:55:54,340 --> 03:55:57,820
For part two, I'm just gonna try and do like uh, I finish the game.

4890
03:55:57,980 --> 03:55:59,240
I don't wanna make it a multi-series.

4891
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:00,700
I'm pretty sure we're almost done.

4892
03:56:00,880 --> 03:56:02,980
Like, it's like what, two more bosses?

4893
03:56:03,200 --> 03:56:04,880
And then like, big boss time, maybe?

4894
03:56:05,400 --> 03:56:05,940
This is...

4895
03:56:05,940 --> 03:56:07,700
I checked, it said it was an eight hour game.

4896
03:56:07,800 --> 03:56:10,160
It was like a six to eight hour game, so...

4897
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:12,180
It won't be that bad, right guys?

4898
03:56:12,880 --> 03:56:13,200
Haha.

4899
03:56:14,680 --> 03:56:17,420
Hey guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated.

4900
03:56:17,700 --> 03:56:18,240
Posture check.

4901
03:56:18,360 --> 03:56:20,060
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4902
03:56:20,200 --> 03:56:23,520
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

4903
03:56:23,640 --> 03:56:24,980
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4904
03:56:25,420 --> 03:56:25,960
Bye guys.

4905
03:56:26,240 --> 03:56:26,640
Bye.

4906
03:57:20,370 --> 03:57:20,770
Woah!

4907
03:57:21,210 --> 03:57:23,290
Shit, you don't see me cause I actually closed it.

4908
03:57:23,810 --> 03:57:24,210
Um...

4909
03:57:24,210 --> 03:57:24,910
Hahaha!

4910
03:57:25,610 --> 03:57:26,310
Secret ending!

4911
03:57:26,950 --> 03:57:27,670
Secret ending!

4912
03:57:28,190 --> 03:57:34,450
So, I didn't show this because I wanna ask permission if I could show it because they sent it to me on DMs.

4913
03:57:34,510 --> 03:57:38,270
So I wasn't sure if I was able to show it to you guys.

4914
03:57:38,810 --> 03:57:41,630
Um, because like, I was like, Oh, did you send it to me DMs?

4915
03:57:41,670 --> 03:57:43,790
I don't know if it was just like, to show it to me or something.

4916
03:57:44,270 --> 03:57:46,130
So I didn't wanna like, cause any trouble.

4917
03:57:46,410 --> 03:57:48,830
But they were like, no, no, you can show it if you want to.

4918
03:57:48,890 --> 03:57:49,730
I was like, yippee!

4919
03:57:50,330 --> 03:57:53,570
Okay, let me get myself on screen real quick.

4920
03:57:53,910 --> 03:57:59,810
I closed I reverted out of croquis, so I got turned back into croquis real quick.

4921
03:58:00,410 --> 03:58:05,310
Um, secret ending, secret ending, give me a sec, I'm trying to find this real quick.

4922
03:58:05,410 --> 03:58:11,410
Okay, secret ending, secret, I need to get croquis back on before I show what the secret ending is.

4923
03:58:11,610 --> 03:58:13,150
Give me a sec guys.

4924
03:58:13,690 --> 03:58:14,210
Croquis.

4925
03:58:14,790 --> 03:58:20,810
I need to turn back into croquis before, uh, before I can show you guys what it is.

4926
03:58:20,810 --> 03:58:24,830
Okay, um, okay, okay, I have to face this way.

4927
03:58:24,950 --> 03:58:26,870
Alright, okay, croquis back.

4928
03:58:27,030 --> 03:58:27,750
I think?

4929
03:58:28,830 --> 03:58:29,710
Is croquis back?

4930
03:58:29,950 --> 03:58:31,230
No, croquis not back.

4931
03:58:31,750 --> 03:58:32,350
The fuck?

4932
03:58:32,710 --> 03:58:33,630
Oh, croquis back.

4933
03:58:33,910 --> 03:58:35,010
Oh, croquis tiny.

4934
03:58:35,590 --> 03:58:36,350
Give me a sec.

4935
03:58:39,230 --> 03:58:40,610
Okay, okay.

4936
03:58:41,350 --> 03:58:51,370
Um, secret ending, secret ending, but, uh, uh, Paco Paco-sensei DM'd this to me.

4937
03:58:51,670 --> 03:58:52,950
Oh wait, no, not this.

4938
03:58:54,230 --> 03:58:54,850
Buy my merch.

4939
03:58:55,390 --> 03:59:09,230
But Paco-sensei DM'd this to me and was like, I really love watching you and I always get energy from you and um, and I love that he drew stars for me.

4940
03:59:11,270 --> 03:59:15,750
I I I I

4941
03:59:18,810 --> 03:59:28,290
I love I love that he drew this is like the big illustration of, um, but yeah, I just wasn't sure if I was allowed to show it.

4942
03:59:28,430 --> 03:59:33,290
I thought it was just like for memes only, but then I asked and he's like, yeah, no, you can show it, whatever you want.

4943
03:59:33,390 --> 03:59:36,790
I was like, thank you, oh my god, thank you for drawing me.

4944
03:59:37,030 --> 03:59:38,970
I really appreciate it.

4945
03:59:39,330 --> 03:59:41,810
Uh, uh, uh,

4946
03:59:45,130 --> 03:59:48,430
he drew stars he was like, hilarious.

4947
03:59:48,790 --> 03:59:49,870
I just got approval.

4948
03:59:50,590 --> 03:59:53,290
I just got permission from him that I could show it.

4949
03:59:53,650 --> 03:59:55,450
So yeah, secret ending.

4950
03:59:55,690 --> 03:59:57,430
Okay, buh-bye for real now.

4951
03:59:57,870 --> 03:59:58,390
Buh-bye.
