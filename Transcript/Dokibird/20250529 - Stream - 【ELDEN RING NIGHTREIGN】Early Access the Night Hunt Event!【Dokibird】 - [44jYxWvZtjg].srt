1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
No, no starting screen.

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,240
I'm just in.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,260
Just in.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,280
In the game.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,860
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,120
Hello, dragons.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,580
And also, people in Zentreya's chat.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,080
Hello.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,780
Kicking it like it's 2010.

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,020
Just straight in the game.

11
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,460
Yeah, just go right in.

12
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,240
Usually.

13
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,240
Alright.

14
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,320
Let me see.

15
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,580
Alright.

16
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,560
Yay.

17
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,940
There's me.

18
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,060
I'm Mr. Bowman.

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,600
Welcome to Let's Play.

20
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,120
Okay, let's see if it's like... I'm trying to make sure it's not... I don't know if it's lagging on the game visual.

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,880
Oh, is it?

22
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,420
I can't tell.

23
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,460
Alright, I'm Mr. Bowman.

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
Because it's like a gun.

25
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,120
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna see if I can turn off.

26
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,280
Oh, Zen, you can invite me whenever.

27
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
I don't know if I can show it.

28
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,040
Oh, Zen's too loud?

29
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,620
Okay, I'll turn Zen down a little.

30
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,260
Uh... Oh, yeah.

31
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,440
You're at 188 for some fucking reason.

32
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,800
I think... I think it's because the game is like kind of loud.

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,080
So sometimes I turn people up instead of turning the game down.

34
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,320
I turned the game down today.

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,880
Advanced setting.

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,220
Okay.

38
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,660
Let's see.

39
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,740
I'm just making sure.

40
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,300
Alright.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Beautiful.

42
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,540
We love that for me.

43
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,180
Alright.

44
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,800
Chat, let me know if everybody sounds good or not.

45
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Yeah.

46
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,080
I'll get you guys in here in just a second.

47
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,440
Hello, hello, hello.

48
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,120
Testing, testing, testing.

49
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,540
Testing, testing.

50
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:28,860
One, two, three.

51
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,600
One, two, three.

52
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,960
And also the games.

53
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:34,820
Oh, shit.

54
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,340
Thanks, Zen.

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,520
Yeah, Zen.

56
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Maybe I wanna know if I sound okay on your screen stream.

57
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,440
Also, where's the training area?

58
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,080
I keep forgetting how... Okay, there it is.

59
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,060
You sound wonderful.

60
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,420
Alright.

61
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,880
So, guys, the gameplay volume, let me know.

62
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,120
So I'm Mr. Bowman.

63
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,780
Look at that.

64
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,280
Pew.

65
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,340
Oh, it's a training room so I can test the gameplay volume.

66
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,800
Yeah.

67
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:52,960
Yeah.

68
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm doing that too.

69
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,400
Let's check it in.

70
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,780
Do you need us to up in here and troubleshoot?

71
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,860
Uh... No.

72
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm good.

73
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,160
I think we're good.

74
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,420
I just have the occasional setters.

75
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,320
But, like, it happens very randomly so I don't know when it's gonna hit me.

76
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,120
Okay.

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,420
We'll leave you to it if you're all good-ish then.

78
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,420
Yeah?

79
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,780
I think so.

80
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,880
Yeah, I think so too.

81
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Sounds good.

82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,220
Thank you for help.

83
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,100
Yep.

84
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,340
Bye-bye.

85
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,080
Thank you very much.

86
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,660
Bye-bye.

87
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,860
Doki, where's the training room?

88
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,140
Um... Okay, so you look at your map, right?

89
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,860
Uh-huh.

90
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,300
Uh-huh.

91
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,500
Okay, we have to get out of the training room so I can...

92
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Yeah, look at the map.

93
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,520
It's on the...

94
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Right side.

95
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,120
So you see the...

96
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,760
Uh...

97
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,700
You see the camp area?

98
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,700
The camping thing?

99
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah.

100
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,280
That's the training area.

101
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay.

102
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,100
I look.

103
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,720
Thank you.

104
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,740
Alright.

105
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,280
Guys, you wanna see my ult?

106
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,100
Give me a sec.

107
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,860
I can't...

108
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,460
It won't let me have my ult yet.

109
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,580
Let me get you guys in here.

110
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,020
Alright.

111
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,740
Trying to build up my ult.

112
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,700
Okay, I'm gonna accept Zen's invite real fast.

113
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,340
Is that volume good, chat?

114
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Or do I need to turn the game up?

115
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,320
I don't know...

116
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,160
I don't know if my sound people are alive.

117
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,880
You should, like...

118
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,100
Alright.

119
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,440
Oh, yeah.

120
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,080
Okay, so chat...

121
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,840
I can do this.

122
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,760
Watch this.

123
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,580
And then that marks everybody and...

124
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,500
Causes more damage for my team.

125
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:30,820
So...

126
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,620
Yeah, guys.

127
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,120
We had to...

128
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
We can talk about yesterday, right?

129
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
I don't know.

130
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,840
Can we wait?

131
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,940
Can we, Zen?

132
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,420
We can, okay.

133
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,980
Okay, so yesterday...

134
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,740
Yesterday, we played...

135
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,600
How many hours?

136
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,680
Six hours?

137
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,640
I don't know...

138
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,380
I just know...

139
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,400
Our first...

140
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,160
We had to...

141
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,680
So we were like...

142
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,300
Alright, guys.

143
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,820
You're supposed to unlock these characters...

144
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,100
And...

145
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,980
Beat these before today.

146
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,900
And then we're like...

147
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,960
Oh, that can't be that bad.

148
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
Six hours later...

149
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,640
We did.

150
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,540
We were like...

151
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,960
We had to go into the game...

152
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,440
Like...

153
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,180
Completely blind.

154
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,020
So we had to learn the game...

155
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,440
And everything.

156
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,220
And we were just like...

157
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah, we were learning the game.

158
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,420
And it was like...

159
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,600
Six hours later...

160
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
We beat the first boss.

161
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,140
We...

162
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,940
I had been awake at that point.

163
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,420
Like...

164
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,560
When I rejoined...

165
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,860
After...

166
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,820
After your stream...

167
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,840
When I rejoined...

168
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,700
Doki was like...

169
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,140
Are you okay?

170
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,540
Huh?

171
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,800
Yes, Zen?

172
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,100
Can you repeat that?

173
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,460
A lot of them do.

174
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,180
Oh my gosh.

175
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,940
Oh yeah.

176
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,080
And then like...

177
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,060
A lot of the boss is like you.

178
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,300
Oh yeah, yeah.

179
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,240
Like every time...

180
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,640
And then...

181
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,960
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,600
That's what's...

183
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,380
Yeah, that's true.

184
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,220
Okay, so like...

185
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,380
You know how I'm an archer, right?

186
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,000
All the bosses were running straight at me.

187
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,780
The archer of the group.

188
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,540
Like...

189
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm here in like two seconds.

190
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I would be like...

191
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,980
Hey guys, I'm here.

192
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,280
And then the boss rushes towards me and fucking crushes me.

193
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,240
I was like...

194
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,000
Guys, I need a res.

195
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,880
I...

196
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,270
Oh yeah.

197
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,490
And then like...

198
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,530
And then we were like...

199
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,090
I'm glad she's tanking all the damage for us.

200
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,570
I'm just the tanker.

202
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,850
And then like...

203
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,190
We finished our first boss.

204
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:13,950
And then...

205
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,350
So...

206
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,330
For those who don't know, guys.

207
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,470
There are speed runners and like actual pro souls players that are playing this game.

208
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,610
And they're like...

209
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,770
Oh yeah, we have multiple save files where we can kill multiple bosses.

210
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,670
And then there's us with one save file with the first boss that we completed yesterday.

211
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,030
They were like which save file I saw we were like, looking at the channel like...

212
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,810
I believe in the U.S.

213
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,710
They were like which save file should we use?

214
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,470
And...

215
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,150
We were like...

216
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,490
What do you mean?

217
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,830
Which save file?

218
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,690
Oh, you're talking about people that are like been playing for a bit or so.

219
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,570
They're like for a week, casual?

220
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,770
And they're like, which poster we do?

221
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,870
And I was like, what do you mean?

222
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:02,730
Which boss?

223
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,930
We are still like the first one.

224
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:15,690
So like, so the event there's supposed to be three bosses, they've Some teams know what the three bosses are, we only know what the one boss is like.

225
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,210
So when we get past the, When we get past the first boss, it's all new to us.

226
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,070
We're gonna be like, alright, what do we do now?

227
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,850
It's okay.

228
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,650
It's okay.

229
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,750
This is winner's POV.

230
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,490
Don't worry about it.

231
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,890
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

232
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,530
We're the winner's POV, guys.

233
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,010
I played some practice games of the previous game earlier.

234
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,310
Look, slow and steady wins the race.

235
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,550
It's not about the speed.

236
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,830
Also, guys, we can't troll too much because apparently...

237
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,730
My reaction time has improved.

238
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,570
That's true, that's true.

239
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:53,570
Also, guys, we can't troll too much because we found out that if we die, we have to sit there and watch other people.

240
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,830
So we have to make it to the end.

241
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,450
Like, we don't want to sit and watch.

242
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,390
So we actually have to try really hard.

243
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:05,930
Don't worry.

244
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,570
We just don't die easy.

245
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:07,810
This is sweaty gamers.

246
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,850
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,390
Yeah, we're gamers.

248
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,810
I feel like I don't remember a lot of yesterday because...

249
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,030
We just keep what we did last night an easy clap.

250
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,590
Exactly.

251
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,410
Honestly, our last run was so fucking good.

252
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,550
We had such good RNG.

253
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,370
We had really, really good RNG.

254
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,850
It was good, yeah.

255
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,890
That day, I woke up at 7 a.m.

256
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,510
to go out for the day.

257
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,110
And when we finished up, Doki, it was 6 a.m.

258
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,770
I ready up just in case.

259
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,650
So it's just...

260
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,550
I'm usually ready up, and then Zen will be like the final ready up.

261
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,590
Yeah, we just don't die.

262
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,490
Just don't die, guys.

263
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,090
It'd be fine.

264
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,390
Easy peasy.

265
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,590
Alright, bring Zen down.

266
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,210
Okay, I'll bring Zen down a little bit more.

267
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,950
Is audio balance good here, chat?

268
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,390
I don't know if audio balance is good.

269
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,230
You're not like this?

270
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,070
And also the game, too.

271
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,010
Let me know.

272
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:58,990
Chat.

273
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,910
Yeah.

274
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,130
So, yeah.

275
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,350
Um...

276
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,450
But yeah, no, I thought it was really fun so far.

277
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,370
I've been...

278
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,790
I think, for me, it's at the multiplayer is really fun.

279
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,130
Single player, I was not enjoying single player as much.

280
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,770
And it is more so...

281
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,290
When you were, like, playing the other...

282
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,090
Or the base game?

283
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,090
Yeah, when I...

284
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,070
No, when I was playing, no...

285
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,230
It's because you don't have your friends with you.

286
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,690
The Night Ring, single player.

287
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,830
Because it's like...

288
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,190
I don't know.

289
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,030
It's definitely a lot...

290
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,270
It's more difficult, for sure.

291
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,150
Even with its scaling.

292
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,870
And I feel like it's just more fun playing multiplayer.

293
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,270
Because if I'm going to play single player...

294
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,410
I think you just missed our voices.

295
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,830
If I'm just...

296
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,510
Yeah, that too.

297
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,390
If I'm...

298
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,210
I missed when I have, like, actual DPS.

299
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,250
Um...

300
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,610
But, like...

301
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,150
I feel like if I'm going to play single player, I'll just play Elden Ring.

302
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,210
The base game.

303
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,110
You know?

304
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,890
I feel like the Night Ring is more so suited for, like...

305
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,130
If you want to have, like, a...

306
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,230
RNG with your team type deal.

307
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,170
Oh yeah, guys.

308
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,690
Here's my ult.

309
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,430
Watch this.

310
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,190
Wait.

311
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,630
I just forgot to use my ult.

312
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,270
Oh, there you go.

313
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,130
There you go.

314
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,930
Boom.

315
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,170
My giant arrow.

316
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,770
Overall though, I think we got this on lock.

317
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,770
Yeah, I think so.

318
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,010
I think we're so, like...

319
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,650
We have to find the...

320
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,290
What is it called?

321
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,330
The flask enhancement places?

322
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,750
Because the five flasks really helped us out a lot.

323
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,790
I think the five flasks was really, really good.

324
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,350
Oh no, guys.

325
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,910
There is a Luna Snow in there, but she's weak as hell.

326
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,050
She's so...

327
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,170
She's, like, so squishy.

328
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,810
Does anybody...

329
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,430
Everybody know what they're playing?

330
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,190
Yeah.

331
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:36,830
Bowman.

332
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,670
I think that's just right now.

333
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,390
Ow.

334
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,290
Ow.

335
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,730
I'm Bowman.

336
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,670
I'm gonna die in the training room.

337
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,230
But you can die in the training room?

338
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,770
You can...

339
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,690
You can animate this soldier guy and he will...

340
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,750
Oh, we gotta tune into the YouTube and Twitch stream.

341
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,950
Oh, we do?

342
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:52,330
Okay.

343
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,210
We got the what?

344
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,590
Wait, what?

345
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,150
Oh, wait.

346
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,010
Tune into the YouTube and Twitch stream.

347
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,370
Oh.

348
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,470
Oh, we have to watch it?

349
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:05,610
Okay.

350
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,510
Okay.

351
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,570
Indeed.

352
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,510
Alright, guys.

353
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,870
Go check out the...

354
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,310
The YouTube...

355
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,950
The YouTube stream.

356
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,870
We actually need to get the link.

357
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,430
I...

358
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,430
Oh, yeah.

359
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:16,850
Hold on.

360
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,370
Let me find the link to it.

361
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,750
Oh, it's just like...

362
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,990
Oh, I guess they're just going through the rules and stuff, right?

363
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,010
Does anyone...

364
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,970
Do you guys have the link to it?

365
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,990
I think so.

366
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,830
I don't know where...

367
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,550
Oh, wait.

368
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,050
I see it.

369
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,470
Never mind.

370
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,790
Here we go, guys.

371
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,710
Ah, here.

372
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,890
I found it.

373
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,430
Yeah, I found it.

374
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,030
Okie dokie.

375
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,010
You got it.

376
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:42,530
Yeah.

377
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,110
That sound...

378
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,370
Oh, and then bring lime a little bit.

379
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,150
Oh, wait.

380
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,050
That's not the right one.

381
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,390
Sorry.

382
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,370
That video is private.

383
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,310
I'll just click the Twitch one.

384
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,110
Wait, why is that video private?

385
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,390
Is that not the right one?

386
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,470
Oh, it wasn't.

387
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,830
What?

388
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:01,970
Okay.

389
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,810
It's a private to me, too.

390
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,670
No, yet...

391
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,290
It's a...

392
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,930
It's a different embed.

393
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:07,890
That's weird.

394
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,930
No, you have to click on the actual YouTube link, not the embed.

395
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:11,690
Oh.

396
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,610
I'm just...

397
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,710
I mean, sorry, the embed.

398
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,850
You have to click on the embed, not the YouTube link.

399
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,390
Got you.

400
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,190
I swapped it around.

401
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,190
I'll just click the Twitch link.

402
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,870
That seems easier.

403
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,430
I guess they're like...

404
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,090
Wait, that's Jake from Overwatch.

405
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,450
What is he doing here?

406
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,530
Wait, he does stuff out...

407
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,730
He exists outside of Overwatch?

408
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,710
Today we learned.

409
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,110
Me when I exist.

410
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,310
So, do we re-broadcast the stream?

411
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,350
Is that what we're doing?

412
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,210
I don't think so.

413
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,230
They just said to watch the stream to see what's going on.

414
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,010
Yeah, we're just watching it.

415
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,770
Yeah, it doesn't say we have to...

416
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,470
I'll just sit in the hold then.

417
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,730
...broadcast it.

418
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,420
Oh my god, he's real.

419
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
I didn't know he was a Souls player.

420
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,660
I can't believe they actually, like, flew people out to the Worlds Between for this.

421
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,520
Wait, really?

422
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,370
Oh yeah, I'm gonna show chat the other characters.

423
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,840
Okay, guys.

424
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,450
Where is it?

425
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,290
Oh, album.

426
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,290
That just seems cool.

427
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:32,170
I feel like a lot of her damage potential probably comes from having characters with high damage potential.

428
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,510
Because, like, your mimic thing should be used after they use their high damage ults, I think.

429
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,210
Oh, the rewind time thing is so cool.

430
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,130
I like her rewind time feature.

431
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,670
Yeah, that's really cool.

432
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,550
So what I can do...

433
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,970
Yeah.

434
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,510
...is after you use your arrow, and then if Zen's using the main guy, the wild guy...

435
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,210
Yeah.

436
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,410
Either one of those.

437
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,710
If I use my rewind, then that hits again.

438
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,830
Oh, I didn't realize it was, like, all of us together.

439
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,190
I thought it was just your damage.

440
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,110
Mm-mm.

441
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,790
I was like, I'm showing them Revenant.

442
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,300
So, guys, this is, like...

443
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,910
This is Revenant.

444
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,690
This is Revenant.

445
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,410
She fucking sucks.

446
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,710
Uh, early game.

447
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,970
How are you then?

448
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,850
Because when you're in level one, this is your HP in level one.

449
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,850
In level one.

450
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,470
And, like...

451
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:19,970
Not...

452
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,010
Don't look at the feet!

453
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,530
I'm gonna stand on the grass so you can't look at the feet.

454
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,330
And...

455
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,110
And the reason I don't like playing...

456
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,430
I...

457
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,250
We were, like, defeated.

458
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,030
We should play...

459
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,870
What's going on over there?

460
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,230
You know how Revenant doesn't wear shoes?

461
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,290
So, like...

462
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,410
Instantly, when I...

463
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,030
When I clicked Revenant...

464
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,590
My entire chat was, like...

465
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,950
Oh my god, her feet!

466
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,710
It's like freaking Evanescence.

467
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,230
So...

468
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,470
Her...

469
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,970
Every time I try to get close to people...

470
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,810
To do this...

471
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,010
I got squished...

472
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,910
By the enemy.

473
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,870
So, like...

474
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,150
But...

475
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,150
I have summons, so I can summon people.

476
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,550
I didn't beat it.

477
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,350
They put Evanescence on the freaking trailer.

478
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,450
Yeah.

479
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,430
Do they?

480
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:58,890
Oh, they did?

481
00:13:59,210 --> 00:13:59,710
That's funny.

482
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,270
So, yeah.

483
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,590
Which one?

484
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,270
What?

485
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,650
I can summon...

486
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,630
This guy.

487
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,090
I can...

488
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,170
I kind of want to, like, unmute it.

489
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,790
And just give people...

490
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,650
When everybody knows.

491
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,490
Perfect by nature!

492
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,290
And then...

493
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,170
There's Sebastian.

494
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,910
My little guy that can't move.

495
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,150
He can't move, by the way.

496
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,110
He just stays there.

497
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,670
Huh.

498
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,830
I think this is on my bot, Alyosha.

499
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,310
I'm...

500
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,710
I'm not really watching it.

501
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:35,910
I'll be avoiding it.

502
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,930
The two thousands.

503
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,300
Alright.

504
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,680
But this is Revenant.

505
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
She can heal, too.

506
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,920
This is her heal button.

507
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,800
Actually, so based for that.

508
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm sorry, I was bopping.

509
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm bad.

510
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,920
Are you bopping to the...

511
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,740
To the trailer?

512
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,940
Yeah.

513
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,380
Hell yeah.

514
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,000
I was being slightly facetious about it being Bring Me To Life.

515
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,840
It broke me back to old gamings.

516
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,860
And then I unmuted it and it was legit just Bring Me To Life.

517
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,960
They know their audience.

518
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,380
Hell yeah.

519
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,470
No, mana doesn't count to summons.

520
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,110
The summons is a skill ability.

521
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,890
Oh, I need to get off that table.

522
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,930
That gives you guys more of a POV for the feet.

523
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,670
Oh, and this is Lyme's favorite character, Duchess.

524
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,570
Should I ask what's going on over there?

525
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,630
She's pretty because she reminds me of like the doll.

526
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,750
Oh, that's true.

527
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,270
Yeah.

528
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,490
Oh, my chat really liked it when I picked Revenant.

529
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,630
For reasons unknown.

530
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,630
Is there a specific reason why?

531
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:01,730
Beep.

532
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,950
Beep.

533
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:02,990
Beep.

534
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:03,730
Beep.

535
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,830
Yeah.

536
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,910
Yeah, Zen's chat.

537
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,270
Why do you like Revenant?

538
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:07,970
Why don't...

539
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,750
I'm just gonna show some of the characters as well, actually, I think.

540
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,870
Yeah, I'm doing that right now.

541
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,970
So don't ready up without me like...

542
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,410
Good idea.

543
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,090
Without giving me a warning.

544
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,150
No, you pick your characters during the character selection.

545
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,010
Oh, that's true, that's true.

546
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,010
Okay, okay, okay.

547
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,750
Also, I lowered both of them down a little bit.

548
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,890
Let me know if that's better, sound guy.

549
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,490
And if the game volume's okay still.

550
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,390
Oh.

551
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,110
I went...

552
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,350
Alright.

553
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,650
So this is Lime's favorite character.

554
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,590
Duchess.

555
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,610
She's like basically like Lady Maria.

556
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,610
And then she has this thing called Rewind.

557
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,410
So...

558
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,630
Every attack I do, Rewind...

559
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,510
Like double...

560
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,230
Like does it again.

561
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,670
But there's like a...

562
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,310
Cool, like...

563
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,310
How many seconds is it anyway, Lime?

564
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,130
Uh...

565
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,750
I don't know.

566
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,770
I don't think it specifies.

567
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,410
I was kinda just doing it based on vibes.

568
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,610
Yeah, just be like...

569
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,210
Vibe-based skillies.

570
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:03,530
Rewind time.

571
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,390
I like how...

572
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,970
I like how Revenant just brings out the claws.

573
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,590
Oh, you.

574
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,750
What is a blue attack anyway?

575
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,190
Which blue attack?

576
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:17,730
When you...

577
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,650
The character weapon skill.

578
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,890
You know when she does a blue attack?

579
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,570
Oh, it's like a magic dagger.

580
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,730
I think it just adds magic damage.

581
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,730
Oh, okay.

582
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,210
Here, weapon.

583
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,010
Rewind time.

584
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,130
I don't know what you're always...

585
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,030
You're always like invisibility, right?

586
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,330
Yeah.

587
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,470
Yeah, and...

588
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,330
Honestly, I feel like probably for now...

589
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,470
I feel like the strongest groups are gonna be just like...

590
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,730
The Wilder and the Iron Eyes.

591
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,370
Because they have the big damage ults.

592
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:45,950
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,230
I like this character.

594
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,670
She's cool.

595
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,230
His giant arrow isn't that...

596
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,470
I don't think it's like actually that much damage in general.

597
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,690
I think it's like...

598
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,130
I think the...

599
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:55,950
What...

600
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,650
Is the Wilder the one with the...

601
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,830
Where you turn to the giant dog?

602
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,410
No.

603
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,250
It's the one that Zem was playing with the hookshot.

604
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:02,850
Oh, yeah, yeah.

605
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,790
That shit was strong.

606
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,070
Yeah, because he's got the big like single target or like...

607
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,130
I feel like the giant dog is pretty strong too.

608
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,190
But yeah, I think this one will be viable because like...

609
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,590
I can just like restage...

610
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,870
And do it again.

611
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,650
People are talking about like art...

612
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,470
The item...

613
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,030
Well, items aren't really that important, I feel like.

614
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,510
Well, until like end game.

615
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,990
I don't use my items that much.

616
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,310
Until like...

617
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,580
Uh...

618
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,590
Because like...

619
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,750
I like putting damage on my weapons.

620
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,750
Yeah, I usually save it for the boss fights too.

621
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,970
But it's like you...

622
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,090
But it's so easy to find items in general.

623
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,970
Around.

624
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,760
Bird guy?

625
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,100
No, he fucking sucks.

626
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,540
No, he's not a fan of bird guy, sorry.

627
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,140
I think maybe it's because he was...

628
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,260
So weird at play.

629
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,420
I didn't understand him.

630
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,460
I was so confused.

631
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,380
I...

632
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,740
He's basically the tank.

633
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,620
But like I was so confused.

634
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,460
This is a...

635
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,180
This is a...

636
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,260
Like he does this.

637
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,440
He was more so like...

638
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
He's like more so like...

639
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,580
Shielding, I think, right?

640
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,260
It's like a shield attack.

641
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,520
And then...

642
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,700
He's like the tank of the...

643
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,580
Of the game.

644
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,500
I didn't like playing him.

645
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm not a good tank.

646
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,500
Oh...

647
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,880
This one is...

648
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,360
This one was...

649
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,420
Is Zen's character.

650
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,500
Wilder.

651
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,540
I went to the wrong place.

652
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,060
Yeah, I'm showing chat Wilder now.

653
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,540
Yeah, Iron Eye is very cool.

654
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,040
Look at his armor.

655
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,480
I get the feeling...

656
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,800
I get the feeling that due to the range and the uptime...

657
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,200
Especially on some things where they were like...

658
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,540
Flinging themselves around the arena.

659
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,280
It was really hard to actually like...

660
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,140
Hit them with melee shit.

661
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,580
Guys, my game crashed.

662
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,280
Give me a sec.

663
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh no.

664
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,040
Oh no.

665
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,300
That's just the first time.

666
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,400
Guys, I don't...

667
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,860
The driver update calls crashes.

668
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,360
Wait.

669
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh no.

670
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,400
Really?

671
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,220
Oh no.

672
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,720
I don't know.

673
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,240
Really?

674
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,940
I updated my drivers yesterday.

675
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,680
If you're suddenly crashing and you weren't crashing before...

676
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,540
I never...

677
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,380
That's true.

678
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,800
I didn't crash before.

679
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,360
I did update my drivers last night.

680
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
Because they were like...

681
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,460
Hell yeah, NVIDIA.

682
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,060
We love you.

683
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,120
I did not update.

684
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,100
Thank God.

685
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,620
You're lying now.

686
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,600
Because I was like...

687
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, I'm stuttering.

688
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,540
Maybe I should update my drivers.

689
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,780
Maybe I...

690
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,060
Okay.

691
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,820
I need an...

692
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,300
I need an invite again.

693
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,360
Guys, the reason why I was updating drivers was because...

694
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,480
We were trying to figure out why I had these mini stutters.

695
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,160
And then like...

696
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,340
They're like asking me...

697
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,240
How long since the last time you updated drivers?

698
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,140
And I was like...

699
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,420
Oh, since like...

700
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,580
December 2020.

701
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,240
I found out it was December 2024.

702
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,860
So I was like...

703
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,060
Alright.

704
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,520
Maybe I should update my...

705
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,700
Drivers.

706
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,450
Alright.

707
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,530
Uh...

708
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,550
Then I need another invite.

709
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,450
Alright, but this is a grappling hook, guys.

710
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,310
I'll get you.

711
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,710
I like his cape.

712
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,310
Which one?

713
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:39,790
Uh...

714
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:39,930
Iron Eye.

715
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,570
Iron Eye?

716
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,130
Oh, yeah.

717
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,490
A little fab.

718
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,770
I don't know if it's also because like...

719
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:44,990
I'm...

720
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,930
I have all these stuff open now, too.

721
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,570
Mm-mm.

722
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,970
Maybe...

723
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,190
It could be that as well.

724
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,730
Because we didn't really test it out with everything open.

725
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,590
Oh, yeah!

726
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:56,950
Maybe!

727
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,070
I have 100% CPU right now.

728
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,770
I...

729
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,650
Time to turn down some settings.

730
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,010
Uh...

731
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,330
Oh, wait!

732
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,350
It's dropping down!

733
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,190
It dropped down.

734
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,590
I don't mind turning down the graphics a little bit, right?

735
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,070
Should be that bad.

736
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,730
Look, when we were testing this out...

737
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,030
Only Zen had to have stuff open, not the rest of us.

738
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,770
If you had like high CPU on launch, it was probably like the anti-cheat launching or something like that.

739
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,590
That's true.

740
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,230
Yeah.

741
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,730
I'll just turn down the graphics a little bit, just in case.

742
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,830
I don't feel like...

743
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,970
We need all...

744
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,610
Whoa!

745
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,270
Maximum!

746
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,190
Let's go!

747
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,950
Mine's not even set to maximum.

748
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,730
What are you doing?

749
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:49,790
Whoa!

750
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,370
What are you...

751
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,430
Is yours on maximum or high or medium?

752
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,190
High, I think.

753
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:55,810
Okay, okay.

754
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,750
My emotions are turned off.

755
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
Alright, it's on high now.

756
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,810
I was like, whoa!

757
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,730
I didn't know I was on maximum settings.

758
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,970
Let's fucking go!

759
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,270
Uh oh!

760
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,210
Ultimate settings.

761
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,670
We don't need water surface quality.

762
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,310
I'm not here to look at water.

763
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,210
Get that ray tracing.

764
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,070
There you go.

765
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,570
Yeah, I don't need to look at water as I go to look at water.

766
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,390
Maybe that's what I was studying.

767
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,150
No, no, when I...

768
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,950
I think the driver update put it on maximum.

769
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,610
Because I remember seeing it on high.

770
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:37,850
Um...

771
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,590
Oh, I see.

772
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,130
Yeah.

773
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,810
That's us!

774
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,610
We're on the stream!

775
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,670
We're...

776
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,610
We're on the stream?!

777
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,530
Oh my god, hello!

778
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,410
Just like the team info.

779
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,470
Oh, okay.

780
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,130
It was like a cool picture of Zen.

781
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,670
Wait, what about us?

782
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,450
Are we...

783
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,530
We're like...

784
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,170
We were names.

785
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,510
Plus ones.

786
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,870
We're the...

787
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,670
We're the lessers.

788
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,130
But also, thank...

789
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,450
Huge shout out to Zen for inviting Lime and I.

790
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,910
Yeah, thank you!

791
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:02,970
To this.

792
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,250
Yeah, thank you!

793
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:06,970
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

794
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,750
Like every time it scrolls by like the speedrunners and the pros...

795
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,010
Yeah!

796
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,830
And then the VTubers!

797
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:12,930
Let's go!

798
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,110
VTuber group!

799
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:15,470
Woo!

800
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,670
We're totally gonna win.

801
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,390
Yippee!

802
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:22,670
Totally!

803
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,450
You know what?

804
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,270
My goal today is that we beat the first boss.

805
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,690
That's all I want!

806
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,710
That's all I want!

807
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,810
That's all I want!

808
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,550
And that it won't take us six hours!

809
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,580
Ooh!

810
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,890
Alright.

811
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:51,770
V!

812
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,260
Zen's stream is on stream right now.

813
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, really?

814
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,560
Can they hear us?

815
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,560
Awkward.

816
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Can they hear us, Zen?

817
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,400
I don't know.

818
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,500
I don't know.

819
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,760
Oh my god!

820
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,440
Hey, everybody!

821
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,600
Hey, YouTube!

822
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,320
Hey, Twitch!

823
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,600
I have- I have it- I have it muted right now.

824
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,920
Because I don't wanna like- Check me out at DokiBird at YouTube.

825
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:20,860
No!

826
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,580
Aw!

827
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,240
Can't even show my own stream.

828
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
Okay, we are about to start.

829
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,480
Oh shit.

830
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,160
Okay, hold on.

831
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,700
I write- oh wait, I'll write it up now.

832
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,220
I write it up.

833
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,320
Wait, where's my sound?

834
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,640
Sound team, is everything good?

835
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,640
Sorry, I keep asking my sound team.

836
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,820
They like, disappeared for a sec.

837
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,140
I'm excited.

838
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,300
Yippee!

839
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,660
We can finally start the game.

840
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,090
It's okay.

841
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,990
I'm sure I will remember everything.

842
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,010
Me too.

843
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,710
We just need to find- Do you remember where the flask places are?

844
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,270
Wait, who's the first one we're fighting?

845
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,450
The wolf.

846
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,870
I think it's just the guy we were doing last time.

847
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,930
Yeah, it's the wolf guys.

848
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,910
I don't know what the second or third bosses are.

849
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,090
Because like, it doesn't- It says like, the missions don't say who the bosses are.

850
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,210
Yeah, I'm assuming it's just the first three.

851
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,830
I don't know.

852
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,990
We might have to ask them like, what's the name of the mission after.

853
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,070
Okay.

854
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,710
Oh, I know we have to fight what's the name of Gladdy, whatever his name is.

855
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,930
And it's the first boss.

856
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,380
Yeah, I don't know why it's named something different there.

857
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,520
Oh, no, it's not randomized.

858
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,060
The final boss- The final boss at the end of each mission is always the same boss.

859
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,100
Yay.

860
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,180
The randomization of bosses is the- Alright, let's go.

861
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,040
The mini bosses we play.

862
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,060
God, we're going.

863
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,580
Okay.

864
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,820
Arrow guy.

865
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,760
Alright, we can't skip two.

866
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,460
Going with my favorite.

867
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,340
Yeah, we don't skip.

868
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,780
Alright guys, look at this cool intro that we saw like, 600 times.

869
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,200
No, we didn't die that much.

870
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,560
It's pretty cool though, but like, after the first two times.

871
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,380
Oh, I don't have my controller overlay up, but I'm not going to tab just in case something terrible happens to the capture.

872
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:33,720
Alright.

873
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,000
Lamu, do you remember any of the Flask are?

874
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,200
Yeah.

875
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Cause I don't.

876
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,000
I remember the icon, yeah.

877
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,360
Okay.

878
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,220
Cause we need like, at least two.

879
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Or one actually.

880
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Where are we dropping?

881
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,600
Let's see.

882
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,320
Alright.

883
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,840
By the way, this is the map.

884
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,640
We might land on one.

885
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,520
Alright.

886
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:48,880
You see it here?

887
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,580
Yeah, I see it.

888
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,320
Let's go there then.

889
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,620
Yeah.

890
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,420
Let's do it.

891
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,960
Okay guys, so here's like, the map.

892
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,220
And you can see it's like, Battle Royale-ish.

893
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,520
Where there's the stone.

894
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,880
Do you want to run through the church really quick?

895
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,120
Yeah, we should get some souls really quick.

896
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,960
Or runes or whatever.

897
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,870
Look at that.

898
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,630
I'm helping.

899
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,370
Helping.

900
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,370
Alright, let's go.

901
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,090
Where's the church?

902
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,330
I don't know.

903
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,190
I'm following you guys.

904
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,910
I'm the follower.

905
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,990
I see it.

906
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,430
I see it too, yeah.

907
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,470
I wonder if we can...

908
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,210
Oh, I can already level up.

909
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,750
Nice.

910
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,230
Yeah.

911
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,870
Alright.

912
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,530
No, there's no friendly fire.

913
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,790
Thank god there isn't.

914
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,370
Let's clear it up.

915
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,530
Okay.

916
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
This one where we...

917
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,740
There's that boss that should be in the hole.

918
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,920
No, it's this guy.

919
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,840
Oh, it's this guy?

920
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,580
Oh, it's him.

921
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:48,840
Okay.

922
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:50,840
Alright.

923
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,640
Perfect.

924
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,240
I'll mark him?

925
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,580
Marked him?

926
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,070
Those who are wondering what the mark does, it basically does more damage for my team.

927
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,230
But we hit it.

928
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:03,430
Back, sir.

929
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,410
Don't worry, the archer is here.

930
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,970
Shooting it very slowly.

931
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,570
I'll mark him again.

932
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,930
Oh, I need my recharge, man.

933
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:15,810
Got it?

934
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,560
Oh my god.

935
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,060
It's not locking in the right...

936
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,300
Oh, he's almost.

937
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:27,680
He's dead.

938
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,100
Easy peasy.

939
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,800
Alright, now we run to the church.

940
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,000
Can we get a thing from that?

941
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, I got a bow.

942
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,780
Very nice.

943
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,300
Why is it there?

944
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:35,820
Very nice.

945
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,520
I have the great bow now.

946
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,740
Okay, so we want to go to the thing I first marked.

947
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,260
Yep.

948
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,460
Oh, shit.

949
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:46,980
I need the grace.

950
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm going to...

951
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,960
I'm following Zen.

952
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,720
On the way.

953
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,180
We can kill these guys too on the way.

954
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,300
How much damage?

955
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,020
Wow!

956
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,620
Nice.

957
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,660
Oh, I missed.

958
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,780
Even though I'm locked in.

959
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,400
How?

960
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,620
I'm locked in!

961
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,780
That's it.

962
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,220
Mini bow time.

963
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,020
Locked in or locked on?

964
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,060
I apparently...

965
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,600
Apparently I was not locked on.

966
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,320
Because it was...

967
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,860
They were too fast for my great bow.

968
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,070
Perfect.

969
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,250
Yay!

970
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,550
Oh, you know what?

971
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,170
I bet you that church had a freaking key.

972
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,570
I remember there's usually a key in the chest behind.

973
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,230
But we should find...

974
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,270
Let me see if I can grab it before we...

975
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,330
I think we want to go back.

976
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:30,950
Maybe you go...

977
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,870
You go for the key.

978
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,150
And then we can go see if there's any other bosses nearby.

979
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,110
Sure.

980
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,070
Yeah, Zen!

981
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,270
Try and find another boss!

982
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,310
There's a dunk!

983
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,630
Let's see right down there.

984
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:48,910
Okay.

985
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,250
I got a talisman.

986
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,130
Wait, where are you Zen?

987
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,750
Unpin!

988
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,230
Oh, I see you.

989
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,150
I'm heading over.

990
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,090
That's okay.

991
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,850
Wait, no, that's the wrong...

992
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,230
Oh yeah, guys.

993
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,970
There's no fall damage.

994
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:02,370
It's great.

995
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,830
Finally a game that I relate to.

996
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,210
It's here.

997
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,190
Oh, you found the...

998
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,830
The key?

999
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,590
Uh...

1000
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,470
There is no key.

1001
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,030
Got unlucky.

1002
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,770
I got a boiled prawn though.

1003
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,150
Oh, is this like...

1004
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,530
Is this just to defeat all the enemies?

1005
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:23,850
Or...

1006
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,010
Or is it this guy?

1007
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,350
Yeah.

1008
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,850
There's another...

1009
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,090
There's another Estus there.

1010
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,550
And another one here actually.

1011
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,690
There's a ton of Estus chargers if you wanna go...

1012
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,090
Make a big...

1013
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,990
Attempt at it all.

1014
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,410
Okay, I have like a giant bat on me.

1015
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,030
Give me a sec.

1016
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,770
It's fine.

1017
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,870
Alright, nice.

1018
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,110
Did we get...

1019
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,970
A thing for the perfumer?

1020
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,570
We did.

1021
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,890
Nice.

1022
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:47,950
Uh...

1023
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,870
Ooh, a heartbow.

1024
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,130
I got one.

1025
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,470
Take the heartbow.

1026
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,890
And here we gotta level up too.

1027
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,950
We're gonna level up.

1028
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:00,570
Yay!

1029
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,210
Okay, where do we go?

1030
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,530
Uh...

1031
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:04,970
Do we wanna...

1032
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,370
I think we wanna go to that green pin first.

1033
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,330
Cause that's gonna be on the outside.

1034
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,890
I think?

1035
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,650
Question mark?

1036
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,310
Yeah, the shot...

1037
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,230
The ring should close soon.

1038
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,970
I have a vault here too.

1039
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,130
Oh, we should kill these guys for extra.

1040
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,590
Oh, yep.

1041
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,650
Here's the...

1042
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,350
Take care of these guys on the way.

1043
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,210
Yep.

1044
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:20,990
We're fine.

1045
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,810
Oh, that sucks.

1046
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,670
This one's in the ring.

1047
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,350
The other one's not.

1048
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,610
Do we wanna try and divert?

1049
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,810
Like, we could try and go for this one up here.

1050
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,650
And then come back into the ring.

1051
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,290
Cause this isn't...

1052
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,310
The other one's in the next ring.

1053
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,610
I mean, we could try.

1054
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:32,830
Smart idea.

1055
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,170
I don't know if we could make it though.

1056
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,290
Cause the ring closes fast.

1057
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,650
Go for it.

1058
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,750
The first one closes less fast.

1059
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,150
I feel like...

1060
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,230
Yeah.

1061
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,670
Alright.

1062
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:45,770
No.

1063
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,190
No.

1064
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:46,590
Hopper, please.

1065
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,090
If we think we're fast...

1066
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,430
The speedrunner knows all the routes.

1067
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,750
No, the speedrunners are so efficient.

1068
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,330
They were like...

1069
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,150
They were just kinda like...

1070
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,590
Should we go here?

1071
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,230
Should we go there?

1072
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:54,970
And they're like...

1073
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,430
Yeah, yeah.

1074
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,010
They were like...

1075
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,810
We memorized all the routes already.

1076
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,550
And I was like...

1077
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,750
Yesterday, by the way.

1078
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,630
Oh my fucking god.

1079
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,570
Oh my god.

1080
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,610
And then we were like...

1081
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,350
What do you mean?

1082
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,410
Here, here, here.

1083
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:05,770
You jump here.

1084
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,130
I don't know.

1085
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,110
Can we navigate this?

1086
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,070
Can we get back up?

1087
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,090
Can we...

1088
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,850
I don't know.

1089
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,030
This can...

1090
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,250
We're gonna die.

1091
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,630
Oh no.

1092
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,130
I don't want the Valiant Gargoyle.

1093
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,230
I don't want the Valiant Gargoyle.

1094
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,230
I got this.

1095
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,690
I'm heading up.

1096
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,710
I changed my mind.

1097
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,070
It sucks.

1098
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:22,850
Okay.

1099
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,150
I don't got this.

1100
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,190
Um...

1101
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,970
So where is the thing?

1102
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,930
Oh, it's to my...

1103
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,250
Here.

1104
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,330
Yeah, go after this.

1105
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,190
Wait, there's nothing...

1106
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,750
Oh wait, there's one here.

1107
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,430
There's the flask.

1108
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:33,930
There's one here.

1109
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,330
Run!

1110
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,630
Okay, now we have five.

1111
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,650
We don't have any more flasks.

1112
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,070
We leave.

1113
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,850
There's a thing at the top.

1114
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,730
There's a thing up...

1115
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,150
We can jump back up the cliff.

1116
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:41,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,230
Zen, do not die to the gargoyle.

1118
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,270
Um...

1119
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,310
That gargoyle had not lost any HP.

1120
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,810
I'm out.

1121
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,410
All I'm saying is that...

1122
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,010
He does not seem to have lost any HP.

1123
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,810
Oh shit, I went into the wall.

1124
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,890
I'm here.

1125
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,330
Okay.

1126
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,770
Where do we go now?

1127
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,010
I'm just gonna head to...

1128
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,170
I'm gonna get straight to zone.

1129
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,910
Oh, there's a castle.

1130
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,350
There has to be...

1131
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,530
Yeah, we can go into the castle.

1132
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,310
Then there's actually...

1133
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,850
The other...

1134
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,970
Uh, charge thing is actually in the...

1135
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,610
Um...

1136
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,030
Ring.

1137
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,090
So we can just grab that.

1138
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:18,470
Yeah.

1139
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,370
Nice and easy.

1140
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,470
I'm gonna kill us.

1141
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,250
Kill these.

1142
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:22,750
Gas press.

1143
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:23,770
That was a lot.

1144
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,150
Oh!

1145
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:25,850
The Jarman!

1146
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,970
Jarman is here!

1147
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,710
He's a dick.

1148
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,990
Alright, I'm heading downstairs now.

1149
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,370
Cause I don't wanna die to Jarman.

1150
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,590
Okay.

1151
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,050
I'll just drink one flash.

1152
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,190
Just...

1153
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,170
Yeah, this castle fucking sucks, chat.

1154
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,210
Because there's the Jarman.

1155
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,330
And they like...

1156
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,870
When we first played it, we died a lot.

1157
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,130
To the...

1158
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,300
To the singular Jarman.

1159
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,550
I don't know where the entrance is to this castle.

1160
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,450
I think I went the wrong way.

1161
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:55,950
Uh...

1162
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,630
Possibly?

1163
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,710
I reached.

1164
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,270
I got in.

1165
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,130
I see it.

1166
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,310
I don't wanna do this by myself.

1167
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,170
I'm heading...

1168
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,050
I'm heading over.

1169
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,810
I found the entrance.

1170
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,670
Almost there.

1171
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:05,650
Yeah.

1172
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,690
Yeah.

1173
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,110
I'm...

1174
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,490
I'm...

1175
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,210
I'm here now.

1176
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,430
So...

1177
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,910
Like the first day, guys.

1178
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,750
You have to memorize.

1179
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,430
You actually have to know where the routes are.

1180
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,510
I'm here.

1181
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,530
Where is he?

1182
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,090
Oh, it's him.

1183
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:17,950
Okay, I'm all dizzy.

1184
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:18,810
I'm all dizzy.

1185
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,930
Don't let him get to me.

1186
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,690
I got the heal.

1187
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,090
Oh!

1188
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:24,650
Oh Jesus!

1189
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,250
I got you.

1190
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,410
I got tapped.

1191
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,790
I got you.

1192
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,130
I got you.

1193
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,650
Thank you.

1194
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,970
Oh my god!

1195
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,290
I got Zen too.

1196
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:34,990
I hate him so much.

1197
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:35,770
I hate him so much.

1198
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,150
Oh shit!

1199
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:36,950
I'm down!

1200
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,290
I'm down!

1201
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,230
Yeah, it's...

1202
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1203
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:41,690
Careful.

1204
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,010
Um...

1205
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,210
I'm gonna crawl...

1206
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,210
near...

1207
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,290
If you can get Doki.

1208
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,470
Yeah, I'm gonna get me too.

1209
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,170
Oh god.

1210
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:50,630
I can get you both.

1211
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,790
I'm not moving.

1212
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,610
Okay, I'm backing out.

1213
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,150
I'm backing out.

1214
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,590
That's what I was afraid of.

1215
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,790
Do we wanna just, like, say no to this one?

1216
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,290
I don't know.

1217
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,390
I'm gonna try and second him.

1218
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:58,610
I think he said no to that one.

1219
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,270
Because I have a lot of souls.

1220
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,510
I think we're under leveled for it.

1221
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:02,830
Yeah.

1222
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,010
I think we res Zen back up.

1223
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,850
Yeah, I'm trying to...

1224
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,530
Oh, I can't.

1225
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,290
I can't.

1226
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,230
He's blocking my...

1227
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,830
Oh wait, I can maybe?

1228
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,250
Careful.

1229
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,270
I can.

1230
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,690
He's blocking my shots.

1231
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,910
He's actually blocking my shots.

1232
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,190
Run!

1233
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,370
Run!

1234
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:15,710
I'm out.

1235
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,950
I don't think we wanna, like, risk the loss.

1236
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,110
Goodbye to your one level.

1237
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:20,450
One fear.

1238
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,610
We need souls.

1239
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,010
We need souls.

1240
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,470
We need to upgrade.

1241
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,490
We need to find a grace.

1242
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:30,750
Honestly.

1243
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,050
Those guys suck.

1244
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:32,990
Yeah.

1245
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,390
We need to find, like, a level up area.

1246
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,950
Sorry, Zen.

1247
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,890
We love you, Zen.

1248
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,850
We miss you, Zen.

1249
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,390
That was such an unlucky one.

1250
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,470
Yeah.

1251
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,290
That's the R...

1252
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,490
Are we good for the Estus Flask?

1253
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,230
And then...

1254
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,950
Yeah, guys, that's the RNG part.

1255
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,030
We don't know exactly what boss we're gonna get.

1256
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,290
And sometimes it could be, like, you know, the worst possible boss to encounter.

1257
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,990
It didn't help that I was two levels down.

1258
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,350
Is this actually one?

1259
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,410
I'm level five now.

1260
00:36:59,590 --> 00:36:59,730
Oh.

1261
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,410
Zone.

1262
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:00,810
Yeah, me too.

1263
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,550
I'm going for the Estus.

1264
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,110
Um...

1265
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,250
Just like the other one.

1266
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,990
I feel like we do need...

1267
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,190
We're so under-leveled, though.

1268
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,650
We're only level six.

1269
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,390
So much pain.

1270
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,950
I feel like we're very under-leveled.

1271
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,150
Oh, hey, Bandai!

1272
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,230
Bandai's my chat.

1273
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,270
And then they said...

1274
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,630
We can try farming the runes.

1275
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,650
They said 07 to you, Zen.

1276
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,350
Rest in peace.

1277
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,110
Thanks, Bandai.

1278
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,830
I appreciate you.

1279
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:35,990
Fair enough.

1280
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,150
Let's Flask Charge here.

1281
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,370
I bet I have so many now.

1282
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,050
That's sick.

1283
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:40,710
Yeah, I don't think we...

1284
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,930
I've never got to six before.

1285
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,890
There's a thing here.

1286
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,350
We can do some more mini bosses rather than scary bosses.

1287
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,830
Yeah, we have to.

1288
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,390
We have to.

1289
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,310
Oh, that is a big...

1290
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,330
Have we even been there before?

1291
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,790
Let's do that.

1292
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,050
I have to.

1293
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:51,930
Scary, scary.

1294
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,090
Yeah, yeah.

1295
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,830
Zen is one level away...

1296
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,130
Up behind.

1297
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,310
So...

1298
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,310
She needs to...

1299
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,170
Level up.

1300
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,770
I've not been in there before.

1301
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:00,610
Yeah.

1302
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:01,950
Where do we go?

1303
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,830
This weapon might be slightly slow for my character.

1304
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,770
I wanted to try and see if we could just jump onto the chest from above.

1305
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,750
Yeah, I saw Zen do it.

1306
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,610
I thought she made it.

1307
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,350
Yeah.

1308
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,770
I was like, Zen must have made it too, right?

1309
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,810
I tried doing style.

1310
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,570
Yeah, it looked cool and then I saw you not make it.

1311
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,580
It was the effort that counts.

1312
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,920
Alright, I guess we go to the castle?

1313
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,720
Ow.

1314
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,180
Is there any bosses in this castle?

1315
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,600
I don't know.

1316
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,320
There's a chest which will have some cool stuff.

1317
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,280
I've decided I don't like this weapon.

1318
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,300
Yeah, but we need better weapons too.

1319
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,700
Yeah, I don't like the moveset on this one.

1320
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,780
Uh oh.

1321
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,720
We're in zone.

1322
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh wait, we're not.

1323
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,140
We're not.

1324
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,080
This is the tree zone.

1325
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,760
It's final zone.

1326
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,460
Oh shit!

1327
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,920
I thought that was you in there.

1328
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,120
No.

1329
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,620
There's a longer over here.

1330
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,400
It's not very good.

1331
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,140
Oh.

1332
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,100
Oh yeah, that's not good.

1333
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,540
Uh...

1334
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,080
Not ideal.

1335
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,380
That's not good.

1336
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,840
Do you think we can quickly go grab...

1337
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,680
There's a big chest upstairs.

1338
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,520
I say we try and grab it before we go.

1339
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,020
Because we are...

1340
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,280
Yeah.

1341
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,580
We're not...

1342
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,620
We're not okay right now.

1343
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,780
Oh, there's a captain here.

1344
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,840
Up here.

1345
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,760
We need to...

1346
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,100
We need to...

1347
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,720
Level up.

1348
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,000
He's here.

1349
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,440
Okay, I'm turning around.

1350
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,260
Oh shit!

1351
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,080
I don't see him.

1352
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,200
Ow.

1353
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,160
Come here.

1354
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,820
I'm here.

1355
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,860
I can strike him.

1356
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,100
Oh, nice ult!

1357
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,060
Wait, where did he go?

1358
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,580
Nice.

1359
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,240
I accidentally took two.

1360
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:37,700
Whatever.

1361
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,780
Chest here.

1362
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,260
Oh, I have a fast weapon for you.

1363
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,340
It's a blood...

1364
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:44,660
Oh please.

1365
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,040
Blood call.

1366
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:45,940
Here.

1367
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,000
That would be great.

1368
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,200
Um, drop it.

1369
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,780
Level four.

1370
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,300
Where are you?

1371
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:52,980
Here?

1372
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,420
Here.

1373
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,500
Here.

1374
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,720
This is a fast weapon.

1375
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,480
Thank you.

1376
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,880
We got a stone key, by the way.

1377
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,440
Did you take it?

1378
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,200
No, I...

1379
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,320
Oh.

1380
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,060
Take what?

1381
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,400
Uh...

1382
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,300
Doki dropped a weapon for me.

1383
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,540
Yeah.

1384
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,880
I dropped it...

1385
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,640
I dropped it back here.

1386
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,460
Ah.

1387
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,400
Let's see.

1388
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,320
I dropped it...

1389
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,900
Is it this?

1390
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,900
It's a blood claw.

1391
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,440
Did those claws?

1392
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,560
Yeah, blood claw.

1393
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,840
We need to go, we need to go, we need to go.

1394
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,060
It's too late.

1395
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,900
It's too late.

1396
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,180
Oh no.

1397
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,680
Oh no, never mind.

1398
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,300
It's on my off hand.

1399
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:26,760
I see it.

1400
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,300
Why'd it go into my off hand?

1401
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:28,820
Weird.

1402
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,820
Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good.

1403
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,700
Run!

1404
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm running.

1405
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:34,920
Whoa!

1406
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,820
The storm's approaching!

1407
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:39,980
Provoking?

1408
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,380
Blood clouds in isolation?

1409
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,700
Provoking, you could say.

1410
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,380
Ha ha ha ha.

1411
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,700
Oh, we're only level six.

1412
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,000
Okay.

1413
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,160
I'm not feeling too confident with those levels.

1414
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
We're a little under level, but we have to...

1415
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
I am only level four.

1416
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,520
Oh!

1417
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,260
We definitely need to level up more on the second night.

1418
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,420
This is going to be rough.

1419
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,020
Yeah.

1420
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,460
Okay.

1421
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,700
We have to coordinate this really well for this final boss.

1422
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,500
Or not the fuck, for day one boss then.

1423
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,360
There's heals here.

1424
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,100
And we need it.

1425
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,220
I'm gonna...

1426
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,400
I'm gonna mark them for you.

1427
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,840
Go back.

1428
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,420
Go back, sir!

1429
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,580
Oh, shit!

1430
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh my god, I didn't see him.

1431
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,580
Oh, I'm gonna heal.

1432
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,500
I can see that guy behind me.

1433
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,420
I'm just gonna ult this, fuck this.

1434
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,200
Can't be bothered.

1435
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,460
I can fire him at more later.

1436
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,100
Oh, the claw's doing good.

1437
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1438
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,560
I'm very pleased.

1439
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,080
Okay, boss.

1440
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:01,480
Alright.

1441
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,680
Oh, it's these guys!

1442
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,620
I'm trying to help you.

1443
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,240
I thank you so much, sir.

1444
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,560
Alright, here we go.

1445
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,560
I think we killed the little guy first, cause he's a dick.

1446
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,260
Okay, I'm gonna go over there to mark him if I can.

1447
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Oh, I missed it!

1448
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,580
I don't know how I missed that!

1449
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm helping you with it.

1450
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,920
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1451
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,620
I can mark him this time.

1452
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,340
Okay.

1453
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,840
I got him.

1454
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,400
I marked him.

1455
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,620
Cool.

1456
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,580
Nice.

1457
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:38,820
Oh.

1458
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,680
Marked him in.

1459
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,620
Nice.

1460
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,400
Alright, help Zen.

1461
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,360
I'm helping you.

1462
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,340
Oh, there's mini guys now.

1463
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,340
I have to do the mini guys.

1464
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,160
He's on me?

1465
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,060
I staggered him?

1466
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,460
He's on me though.

1467
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,300
I gotta get the little guys out.

1468
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,280
Come on, mark him.

1469
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,720
Staggered.

1470
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,880
I have mark again.

1471
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:26,890
Oh shit!

1472
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:27,490
Goodbye.

1473
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,490
Do you have rewind?

1474
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,010
Cause I have ult.

1475
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,990
Uh, one second.

1476
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:32,310
Yes.

1477
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,870
Okay, I'm ulted.

1478
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,210
Actually, he's gonna be dead.

1479
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:36,730
Dead.

1480
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,550
Yippee!

1481
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:42,610
Okay.

1482
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:44,710
Alright.

1483
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,850
Flax slowly restores HP.

1484
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,130
Is that bad?

1485
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,390
Is that good or bad?

1486
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,770
Uh, it replaces the instant heal with a heal over time, I think.

1487
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,890
Okay, we'll see how that goes.

1488
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,370
I got it.

1489
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,550
Cause the other two upgrades were pretty shit.

1490
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,650
Oh, it's bad?

1491
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,790
Too late guys!

1492
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,530
I'm living with these decisions!

1493
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,270
Okay, let's go over there.

1494
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,530
Yeah.

1495
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,270
Straight over there.

1496
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,670
Yup.

1497
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,990
Yeah, my other two were like, for thrust weapons.

1498
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,330
Hopefully I get a better weapon drop this time.

1499
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:24,810
Yeah.

1500
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,530
I'll see if I...

1501
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,310
If there's good weapons for you too.

1502
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:28,970
Okay, we're good.

1503
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,610
There's also a big enemy on the outskirts that we should grab really quick.

1504
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:32,930
Yeah.

1505
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,050
Before the thing collapses.

1506
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:35,090
Oh, you have the...

1507
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:35,410
Oh, hello sir!

1508
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:37,690
I can...

1509
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,810
I marked him?

1510
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,470
I need the Bloodheld Knight.

1511
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:40,970
He's on me.

1512
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,230
Oh!

1513
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,090
No!

1514
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,930
I'm an archer!

1515
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:45,910
Ruby's spinning!

1516
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:47,790
Please!

1517
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,390
I'm just an archer!

1518
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:50,730
Yeah, boy.

1519
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:52,210
Guys.

1520
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,930
Okay, I'll mark him.

1521
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,090
Marked.

1522
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,990
Please, sir.

1523
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,850
I'm just a ranged man.

1524
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,850
We got him.

1525
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,490
Good stuff.

1526
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:08,750
Nice.

1527
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,530
Oh, maximum HP raise.

1528
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:13,830
I'll take that.

1529
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,430
I need this.

1530
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:15,350
Yeah.

1531
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:15,890
Uh...

1532
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,070
We should go here.

1533
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,050
Alright.

1534
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:18,850
Alright.

1535
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:19,910
Level 7.

1536
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:20,290
There's also...

1537
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:20,950
There's a little guy.

1538
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,370
There's a little guy on the way.

1539
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:22,890
Agreed.

1540
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:23,630
I see you.

1541
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,710
Come here, little guy.

1542
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,690
Don't run!

1543
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,630
Don't run!

1544
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,650
Yippee!

1545
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:32,750
Alright.

1546
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,890
What is my...

1547
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,030
Nice.

1548
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,370
Wait.

1549
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,610
I have improved sorceries.

1550
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,370
Does anyone use magic here?

1551
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:41,410
No.

1552
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:41,950
Okay.

1553
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,110
Well, this item's useless.

1554
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,750
I'm allergic to magic.

1555
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,450
I am coming over.

1556
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:51,450
Yippee!

1557
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,990
How dare you bring magic into this room?

1558
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,070
Oh, I found it!

1559
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,650
Like, what was I supposed to do?

1560
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,870
Oh, hello, sir.

1561
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,530
How are you doing today?

1562
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:04,850
Oh, this guy.

1563
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,730
The draconic tree sentinel.

1564
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,190
Not this guy.

1565
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,030
It's okay.

1566
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,170
He doesn't see me here.

1567
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,670
That's going to hurt a lot.

1568
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,770
Okay.

1569
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,770
I'm gonna...

1570
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,810
I marked him.

1571
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,050
Res?

1572
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,630
Oh, my god!

1573
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,390
I got one shot.

1574
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:18,950
I got you.

1575
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,630
I got you.

1576
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,070
I got you.

1577
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,290
Res.

1578
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:21,750
You're res.

1579
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,170
I see.

1580
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,730
I'm picking up what you're putting down.

1581
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,450
And I don't like it.

1582
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,670
Bye.

1583
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,990
Ugh.

1584
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:29,730
Okay.

1585
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,010
Oh, shit!

1586
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:32,530
What?!

1587
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,710
He one-shot me.

1588
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,010
Yeah.

1589
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,870
He's on me if you can get her, Zun.

1590
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,290
Yeah, and he's going to get me.

1591
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,570
I'm going.

1592
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,130
Zen, Zen, Zen!

1593
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:40,830
I'm right here.

1594
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:41,890
I stealthed.

1595
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:42,430
I stealthed.

1596
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:42,790
I stealthed.

1597
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,250
Okay, nice.

1598
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,910
Oh, my god!

1599
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,910
Oh, my god!

1600
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:49,070
Oh, my god.

1601
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:49,430
Ow.

1602
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:49,810
Ow.

1603
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:50,170
Ow.

1604
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:50,530
Oh, my god.

1605
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,150
Do we abort this?

1606
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,050
Because what the fuck?

1607
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,510
I feel like we could come back.

1608
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,910
Do you really want this fight?

1609
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,590
Can we come back to him or no?

1610
00:46:59,610 --> 00:46:59,930
He's really tough.

1611
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:00,870
He's on the outskirts, so no.

1612
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,410
Okay, you know.

1613
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,530
If you can res me, we leave.

1614
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:03,770
Um...

1615
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:04,950
He's on me.

1616
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:05,450
He's on me.

1617
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:05,910
He's on me.

1618
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,170
He's on me.

1619
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,030
Zen, he's on me.

1620
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,970
You have to res her.

1621
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,790
Yeah, if you can touch me, we go.

1622
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,470
Yeah, he's on me right now.

1623
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,110
We want one of the inner ones, I think.

1624
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:16,530
Oh, too late.

1625
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:17,650
Oh, no.

1626
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,430
Alright, I mean...

1627
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,090
We don't want that shit.

1628
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:20,430
I left.

1629
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,750
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1630
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:24,970
Yeah, um...

1631
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:25,330
Okay.

1632
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,030
That's unlucky.

1633
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,430
I kept my levels, guys.

1634
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:29,210
The archer.

1635
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,310
Do we want to try and kill the guy in the castle this time?

1636
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,050
Like, now that we've gotten a couple of levels?

1637
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:38,850
Oh, that ring time.

1638
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,550
Yeah, we have to get some bosses.

1639
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,950
Let's do it.

1640
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:41,730
We're so under leveled.

1641
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,230
We have to be level 10 by the end boss.

1642
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:43,830
Oh!

1643
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,210
Oh.

1644
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,340
What hit me?!

1645
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,230
Zen, Zen, Zen, Zen, Zen!

1646
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:48,990
I'm right beside you!

1647
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,610
I don't know what hit me.

1648
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,970
He can hit you from all the way over there.

1649
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,270
I think that fireball sniped.

1650
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,350
Why?!

1651
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,190
I...

1652
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,770
That's insane.

1653
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,790
That's crazy!

1654
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,250
I was like...

1655
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:06,630
What...

1656
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,090
What happened?

1657
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,050
He shot me from all the way over there.

1658
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,590
What happened to me?

1659
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,710
I like that guy.

1660
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:14,010
He goes, dude.

1661
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:14,470
That's insane.

1662
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,190
See guys, this is what we mean by RNG.

1663
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,890
We got RNG twice with bad...

1664
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,590
...bad bosses.

1665
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:22,390
And he took that personally.

1666
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,830
It doesn't show where the ring's going yet.

1667
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,610
So I'm like really nervous to commit to anything.

1668
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,030
Cause if we go down into the castle...

1669
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,730
...and the ring is not on the castle...

1670
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,990
...we are beansed.

1671
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:30,410
I think...

1672
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,930
I feel like it's gonna be here.

1673
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:33,650
Alright, let's just...

1674
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,490
...find a boss.

1675
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,770
We just need to find any boss.

1676
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,470
There's a heal here.

1677
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,450
If we get through it really fast...

1678
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,430
...then just we're good.

1679
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:41,310
Um...

1680
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,590
Well, then castle boss is here.

1681
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,030
Alright.

1682
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:45,850
I'm ready.

1683
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:46,790
I'm just following.

1684
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:51,930
We're in zone.

1685
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:52,390
We're in zone.

1686
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:52,910
We're in zone.

1687
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,110
We're in zone.

1688
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:53,470
Okay, cool.

1689
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,500
Weird grafted scion.

1690
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,180
I've come to bargain.

1691
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,020
Guys, the reason why my flask isn't instant...

1692
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,440
...is because I had three shitty power-ups to choose from...

1693
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
...and this was the least shitty one.

1694
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,660
But usually the flask is instant.

1695
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,200
We're here.

1696
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:09,860
Alright.

1697
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,060
Welcome back.

1698
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,400
You can rewind.

1699
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,120
I ulted too.

1700
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,020
We're back, bitch.

1701
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:17,960
And we have...

1702
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,140
We're more leveled up now.

1703
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,740
Oh!

1704
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,380
I'm sorry.

1705
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,240
I'm so sorry.

1706
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,020
I didn't mean it.

1707
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:25,920
I didn't mean it.

1708
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,640
I'm just an Archie.

1709
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,800
Why me?

1710
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,060
Why me?

1711
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,620
I'm sorry.

1712
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,800
I didn't mean it.

1713
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,880
He's dead.

1714
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,980
You're safe, Dougie.

1715
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,460
You're safe.

1716
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,840
I talk too much shit as the Archie.

1717
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:52,760
I...

1718
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,620
Actually, what's my...

1719
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,440
I got a good weapon.

1720
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,420
73?

1721
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,940
Oh, it was a big one.

1722
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,860
That's like five.

1723
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,580
I don't know.

1724
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:58,920
Wait.

1725
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,400
Successive attacks plus three?

1726
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:01,680
That's good.

1727
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,060
Uh, Zen, do you want a big, bonky stuff?

1728
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,400
Can I get this, guys, or this?

1729
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,620
Does this work for Bo?

1730
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,100
Does this work for Bo?

1731
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,560
What's up?

1732
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,460
Do you want this?

1733
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,420
Uh...

1734
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,760
Is it better than what you have?

1735
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,620
Bo?

1736
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,020
Okay.

1737
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,120
Holy yes, it is.

1738
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,000
Cool.

1739
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:20,900
I'll get the Bo.

1740
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:21,940
Alright.

1741
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,560
I'm good to go.

1742
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,850
See, guys, this is what Zen meant when all the bosses wanted to kill me.

1743
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,010
I'm only level seven.

1744
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:34,390
Oh!

1745
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,350
I forgot to level it up!

1746
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,470
Let's just...

1747
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,490
I'll just find another Grace.

1748
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,250
Oh god, no.

1749
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:41,830
Um...

1750
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,230
Um...

1751
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,330
Uh...

1752
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:44,110
Uh...

1753
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,220
Increase...

1754
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,380
Oh!

1755
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,940
I like that.

1756
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,500
I have better range.

1757
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:51,820
Oh, go Scarab.

1758
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:52,700
Nice.

1759
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,120
Hmm...

1760
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,040
Okay, I have better range with my Bo.

1761
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,160
We should kill, like, this guy.

1762
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,900
There's a boss here.

1763
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,080
Uh...

1764
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,120
We're in zone, though.

1765
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,680
Yeah, we should go kill the boss.

1766
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:05,980
Hey!

1767
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,100
I fell off.

1768
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,760
Oh no.

1769
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,400
That's awkward.

1770
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,460
It's alright.

1771
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,780
It's okay, it happens to the best of us.

1772
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,420
Go rebound.

1773
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,240
I know it.

1774
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,840
You just need, like, one big YouTube video, you'll do great.

1775
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,580
Yeah, exactly.

1776
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,920
You can clickbait me if you want.

1777
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,020
You can use me as clickbait.

1778
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,680
Maybe, like, a cool collab, something like that.

1779
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,360
Oh my god.

1780
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,000
Okay, we killed the griffon guy that was down here?

1781
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,260
Uh...

1782
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,120
Vod, you skip over one hour.

1783
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:26,400
No.

1784
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,460
No.

1785
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,680
We haven't.

1786
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,260
We can.

1787
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,080
Let's go kill him.

1788
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,720
We have to wait for his end, though.

1789
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,660
See how much he kills us.

1790
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,760
I'm waiting for his end.

1791
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,140
Okay, I'll come over now.

1792
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,480
How the heck did you guys get up there?

1793
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:39,860
Um...

1794
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,780
I landed in lava?

1795
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,800
So freaking fast.

1796
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,040
We should probably start because we don't have that one.

1797
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,320
Yeah, I know.

1798
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,780
I'm starting with you right now.

1799
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,040
Okay.

1800
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,200
Big damage, big damage.

1801
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,080
Um...

1802
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:53,480
He's on me, guys.

1803
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,440
As the...

1804
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,060
He's very slowly heading towards me and I'm scared.

1805
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,380
This guy is very frightening.

1806
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,720
Oh, Jesus!

1807
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,120
That's what I meant when I said he's very slowly heading towards me.

1808
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,020
Nope, nope, nope.

1809
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:12,870
I can't...

1810
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,070
I can't mark him for us.

1811
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,310
Oh.

1812
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,190
I'm...

1813
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,890
I'm cutting in to mark him.

1814
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,550
Are you serious?

1815
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,470
He dodged my mark.

1816
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:27,790
Oh, I have ult.

1817
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,710
I'm gonna back up.

1818
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,950
Oh my god, I'm like...

1819
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,470
What the fuck?!

1820
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,230
Shoot.

1821
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:36,930
Okay.

1822
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:37,450
He...

1823
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:37,870
I...

1824
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,430
He's...

1825
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:39,710
Okay, guys.

1826
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,550
Now he's up there.

1827
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:42,950
He might...

1828
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:43,570
He might have...

1829
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,490
He might have cooked us.

1830
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:45,350
No, no, no.

1831
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,170
He's slowly dropping down.

1832
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,210
He's slowly dropping down.

1833
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,230
And he's looking at me.

1834
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:48,830
He's...

1835
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,110
He's definitely looking at me.

1836
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,310
Statues don't bleed!

1837
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,430
Oh!

1838
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:54,810
Yep!

1839
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:55,730
There he is!

1840
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,950
Alright.

1841
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,930
Oh, what in the world is this guy doing?

1842
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,390
I don't know.

1843
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,650
He really does not like the archer.

1844
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,650
You're being a little bit silly, buddy.

1845
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:08,590
Up there.

1846
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:10,390
Yeah.

1847
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,390
Statues don't bleed!

1848
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,170
He's looking at me again, guys!

1849
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:17,990
Wait, I can mark him here.

1850
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:20,850
I marked him?

1851
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,030
Oh my...

1852
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:22,210
Oh!

1853
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,750
Wait, did we all die?

1854
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,410
Oh, oh, oh.

1855
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:24,490
Oh, no.

1856
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,250
Sen's still left.

1857
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,150
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1858
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,510
Lime is one...

1859
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,450
Lime is one hit.

1860
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1861
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:29,970
You need to pop me once.

1862
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:30,910
Yeah.

1863
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:31,450
Thank you!

1864
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,870
Um, I think I might lose level here.

1865
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,550
No...

1866
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,450
I didn't even upgrade.

1867
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,950
I didn't upgrade at all.

1868
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,970
I have a lot of runics too.

1869
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,050
So I have to grab my things.

1870
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,270
Where are you guys?

1871
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,070
Took my eyes off of it for one second.

1872
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,130
Wait, where are you guys?

1873
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:51,930
Okay, right here.

1874
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:52,590
Still there.

1875
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,350
I'm gonna try and grab my stuff back.

1876
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,690
He's kinda low.

1877
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,750
I'm like still under level.

1878
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,930
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1879
00:53:59,650 --> 00:53:59,810
Hum.

1880
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,190
I'm gonna try...

1881
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:04,710
I'm gonna try and get Lime.

1882
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,390
Can you get me?

1883
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1884
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,290
Gotta go quick.

1885
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,450
Okay, so let me know...

1886
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,830
Let me know when he's coming up to me.

1887
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:12,370
You look okay.

1888
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,850
You look fine.

1889
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:13,310
Okay.

1890
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,210
Alright.

1891
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:16,350
Um.

1892
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,070
He is still looking at me.

1893
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,030
I got her.

1894
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:19,330
I got her.

1895
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:19,610
I got her.

1896
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,010
We need to kill him because I really...

1897
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,630
I really need to level up.

1898
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,210
I'm like level 6 right now.

1899
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,010
Oh no.

1900
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:27,350
Oh Jesus.

1901
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:28,010
I'll get...

1902
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:28,730
Can you get her?

1903
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:29,490
No, I'll get her.

1904
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,090
Oh my god.

1905
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,030
Yeah, he's on me.

1906
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:33,410
He's on me.

1907
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:33,690
I got her.

1908
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,110
I need help though.

1909
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,770
Is he still on me?

1910
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,510
He's really low.

1911
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,350
He's like mad.

1912
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,170
He has to be...

1913
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,570
He's like mega over level for me.

1914
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:49,370
Oh.

1915
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:50,370
He's one hit.

1916
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:50,710
He's one hit.

1917
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:50,810
He's one hit.

1918
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:50,930
Got him.

1919
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:51,270
Got him.

1920
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:51,630
He's dead.

1921
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:51,930
Yeah.

1922
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,230
Help me with Zen.

1923
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,650
I'm helping you.

1924
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,370
There you go.

1925
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,070
Can we touch this?

1926
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,530
Wait, what?

1927
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:12,550
Zen hasn't... Zen hasn't been... We didn't finish picking up Zen live!

1928
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:13,750
Sorry.

1929
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,710
I've dragged out the bird to death.

1930
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,150
Hold on.

1931
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,630
Me too.

1932
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,010
Uh... We need to be careful of the ring here.

1933
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:25,330
It's okay.

1934
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,250
It happens.

1935
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:27,290
Okay.

1936
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,950
Uh, ring is up there.

1937
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,690
We gotta go.

1938
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,270
Hey, this is fine.

1939
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,330
Um... Zen?

1940
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,070
Um... Um... I'm trying to get Zen up right now.

1941
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:41,250
This is fine.

1942
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,750
The fuck is this?

1943
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,150
Totally.

1944
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,370
The weapon I wanted was there.

1945
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:47,850
I'm trying.

1946
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:48,510
My vent.

1947
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,670
Oh, I'm not high enough level to get that.

1948
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,050
That sucks.

1949
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:51,570
I'm trying.

1950
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,370
It's so high, but I only have arrows.

1951
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,210
And you were three down.

1952
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,670
There we go.

1953
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,090
Wait.

1954
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,770
If you rested the grease, I think that resets that for what it's worth.

1955
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,230
Thank you.

1956
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:03,870
Alright.

1957
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,490
I totally knew that.

1958
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,150
It sucks down here.

1959
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,350
This map layout is ass.

1960
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,710
I'm just gonna put that down.

1961
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,610
Oh, I went backwards.

1962
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,370
Whoops.

1963
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,970
Yeah, no.

1964
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,150
You did run towards me.

1965
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:17,730
I went the wrong way.

1966
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,970
I didn't know which way it was.

1967
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,830
I'm trying to, like, stop him from dying.

1968
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:21,970
I'm not going to fight that guy.

1969
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:22,630
Nope.

1970
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,290
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

1971
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,470
I'm trying to make sure I don't die at a zone.

1972
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,990
My chat's like, that thing has a really good skill, unfortunately.

1973
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,550
Unfortunately, I'm not level 10.

1974
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,750
We'll be level 10 at soon, though.

1975
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,690
We should be level 10 by then, right?

1976
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,230
Hey, I took a long turn on Albuquerque.

1977
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,830
You gotta run.

1978
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,480
I don't know if we're gonna have levels for the boss.

1979
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,220
I don't know for the final boss.

1980
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah, I think, well, this is the final boss after this one.

1981
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,200
No, no, no, I meant the wolf.

1982
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,820
I'm worried about the wolf.

1983
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,820
After this one is him, so we're gonna get maybe one level.

1984
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,980
Whereas I think we were 12 on our winning run.

1985
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:08,740
I am so scared.

1986
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,720
Yeah, we don't have a lot of that.

1987
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,600
Like, we were...

1988
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,940
Oh wait, I have the semi-human queen on me here.

1989
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,620
Yeah, I don't think we have time to kill her.

1990
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,420
We could try.

1991
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,700
We can kite her over here, maybe.

1992
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,800
Yeah, I'm trying to.

1993
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,540
I really hope there's a way out of here.

1994
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,080
Okay, I'm ulting us.

1995
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,460
And then you can use time.

1996
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,000
Can you use it?

1997
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,440
Yup, yeah, I've used it.

1998
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,360
Look at her health.

1999
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,360
Look at her health!

2000
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,300
Yeah, yeah, we do have time.

2001
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,080
She's aggroed to me, so...

2002
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,480
She's still aggroed to me.

2003
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,160
She's one.

2004
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,920
We have to get it quick.

2005
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,620
What in the world?

2006
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:45,460
Um...

2007
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,660
So, hey guys, I might be dead.

2008
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,660
Uh, how did you get lost?

2009
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,940
I have a really good story.

2010
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
I'm gonna bring it for you.

2011
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:53,640
Just letting you know.

2012
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,020
I don't know this story.

2013
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,760
I have a really, really good story.

2014
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:58,880
I'm gonna drop this.

2015
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,400
Zinn went the wrong way.

2016
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,420
Oh no, Zinn.

2017
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,020
Zinn went the wrong way.

2018
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,040
I don't know if this is good for you.

2019
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,980
Oh, thank you.

2020
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:04,440
Yeah.

2021
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:04,900
Where?

2022
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,380
Yeah, let's just say I'm toast.

2023
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,540
I don't know if it is.

2024
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,340
It looks cool though.

2025
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,000
Oh, seven.

2026
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,100
Oh no, Zinn is very...

2027
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,680
I miss you, Zinn.

2028
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,780
Zinn might be low level for the last run.

2029
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,260
I think we're all gonna be a little bit...

2030
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:19,460
Yeah.

2031
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:20,360
I'm...

2032
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:20,740
Whoa!

2033
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,040
I didn't realize it started!

2034
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,920
Yeah, the perfumes are up.

2035
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,140
Oh my god!

2036
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,240
Sir!

2037
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,520
Sir!

2038
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,280
What?!

2039
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,300
I got fire herald.

2040
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,560
I got fire herald instantly.

2041
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,420
Wait, Zinn isn't gonna be part of this run!

2042
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,220
Because it started!

2043
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,400
I just...

2044
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,960
Oh no, she is!

2045
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,940
She's here, she's here, she's here.

2046
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,340
Oh, thank god.

2047
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,820
No panic, no panic.

2048
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,680
That scared the shit out of me.

2049
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,260
Only bravery!

2050
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,120
That sucks, because I'm now...

2051
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,040
I lost my...

2052
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,800
Should still be a good amount of level.

2053
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,060
Did he just go mad?

2054
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,980
I think he went mad.

2055
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:01,740
Yeah.

2056
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,360
I'm really annoyed that we got, like, screwed on the, uh...

2057
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,320
Demi-humans...

2058
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,980
Yeah, we got screwed over.

2059
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,140
Because I think I would've gotten a level from that.

2060
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,080
Yeah.

2061
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,280
Oh god, who's it gonna be?

2062
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,120
Oh no!

2063
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,100
Are you serious?!

2064
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,760
What is our idea?!

2065
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,740
What is our idea?!

2066
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,220
Wait, at- Okay, whoever's got the cav- The sentinel, just dodge...

2067
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,300
And we'll kill the cavalrymen.

2068
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,120
I'm...

2069
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,240
I'm doing the cavalrymen right now.

2070
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:27,840
With you.

2071
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,400
Good idea.

2072
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:29,700
Okay.

2073
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,080
I'll do the one with you.

2074
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,620
We have both of them on me.

2075
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,780
I'm hitting him.

2076
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,220
Uh...

2077
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,280
Yeah, they're both on me.

2078
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:39,860
They're both on me.

2079
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,320
Arch your aggro!

2080
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,140
Archer, aggro.

2081
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,900
I'm just fucking chasing you around.

2082
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,460
Stop!

2083
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,580
I marked both of them.

2084
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,420
What the...

2085
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,260
I can't even use my ult.

2086
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Bro, bro, fuck you.

2087
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,140
I have the other cavalry guy on me.

2088
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:10,940
So...

2089
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:11,680
Yeah.

2090
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,540
Let me just mount him for you.

2091
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:13,860
Hold on.

2092
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:14,820
Yeah, that would be great.

2093
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,080
Thank you.

2094
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,140
I'm gonna ult then.

2095
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,400
There you go.

2096
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,220
You wanna rewind that?

2097
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:22,540
I did.

2098
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:23,500
Nice.

2099
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:24,840
Good rewind.

2100
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,660
Thank you.

2101
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,700
Okay, I'm gonna mark him for us.

2102
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,040
So then you can do more damage.

2103
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:35,820
Nice.

2104
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,220
Alright.

2105
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,900
Okay, now we can help you, Zen.

2106
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,340
Good job, Zen.

2107
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:39,960
Nice aggro.

2108
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,260
Okay.

2109
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:42,880
Alright.

2110
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,180
He's aggro to me now.

2111
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,460
Watch the charges.

2112
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,900
I think he's on me.

2113
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,220
He's staggered?

2114
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,200
Nice, nice stagger.

2115
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,200
I'm gonna...

2116
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,400
I say as I get hit.

2117
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,400
Marked him?

2118
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,660
It's incoming in from nowhere.

2119
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,260
Oh no!

2120
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,260
I got staggered!

2121
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:03,980
I got...

2122
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,780
He tried to pop me.

2123
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,320
Yeah, I popped.

2124
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:05,780
Thank you!

2125
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,920
I'm gonna full heal just in case.

2126
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,100
Cause I only have slow heals.

2127
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:11,160
Yeah.

2128
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:12,880
Okay.

2129
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,190
Oh, Zen.

2130
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,090
Nice.

2131
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:24,910
Marked him?

2132
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,130
He is rewound.

2133
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,710
He's so low.

2134
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:32,970
He's so low.

2135
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:33,550
Oh.

2136
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,630
I can mark him again soon.

2137
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,530
Holy did not see that.

2138
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,290
Charges coming out.

2139
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:38,950
Watch it.

2140
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:40,110
He's ha...

2141
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,110
I think he might charge...

2142
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:41,930
He might charge Zen?

2143
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,790
Yeah.

2144
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,430
Watch the AoE.

2145
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,970
I almost have ult again.

2146
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,330
He's buffed.

2147
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,070
I have to regen stamina.

2148
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,650
I have ult here?

2149
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,450
Do you have rewind?

2150
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:56,570
Yup.

2151
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:57,110
Alright.

2152
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,550
Rewind?

2153
01:01:58,950 --> 01:01:59,690
Rewind.

2154
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:01,590
Nice.

2155
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:02,110
Yeah!

2156
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:04,730
Yay!

2157
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,670
Hooray!

2158
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:08,310
Oh!

2159
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,990
Really good stuff.

2160
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:12,570
Yay!

2161
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,750
We made it to the Wolfman!

2162
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:17,710
I forgot...

2163
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:17,950
Oh wait, though.

2164
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,690
We got the level up at the third boss.

2165
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,310
Yeah, yeah.

2166
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,870
We got the grace.

2167
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,930
Oh, scary.

2168
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,310
That is scary.

2169
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:29,130
Alright.

2170
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,650
Yeah.

2171
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,830
This is where it gets a little horrifying.

2172
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,250
Alright.

2173
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:32,970
I'm level 11.

2174
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:35,030
10.

2175
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,350
Could be worse.

2176
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,050
What was the weapon that I got?

2177
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:38,630
Nebula.

2178
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,030
Is this where I'm losing the bleed chat?

2179
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,490
107 on that one.

2180
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:45,990
Alright.

2181
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:46,830
So...

2182
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,610
This is where everything...

2183
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,770
This is where everything sort of...

2184
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:51,470
Goes crazy.

2185
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:53,450
I can do the pull...

2186
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,150
Pull blade would be fun, actually.

2187
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:56,530
Yeah, this is the one I gave you, right?

2188
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:57,850
Yeah.

2189
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:00,010
Although, actually, it's got less damage than the claws.

2190
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,870
So I think, actually, the claws are better.

2191
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,270
I don't know.

2192
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,550
I think the pull is just more range if you want to...

2193
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,610
Do range and stuff.

2194
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,040
Hmm...

2195
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,720
I don't know.

2196
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,620
I just know that...

2197
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,880
This is where it gets crazy.

2198
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,020
Oh, yeah.

2199
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,880
Let's see...

2200
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:21,860
Uh...

2201
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,040
Just like last night.

2202
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:23,620
Blood blade dance is good?

2203
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,520
Okay, hold on.

2204
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,540
Let me just get a couple of things.

2205
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:27,980
I'll have some...

2206
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,480
Oh, whoops.

2207
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,580
I have some shitty items.

2208
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,160
I should have picked better items.

2209
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,380
For this.

2210
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:33,860
Run.

2211
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,580
I don't think I can afford...

2212
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,680
This guy has prawns, if you're interested.

2213
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,380
No, I already...

2214
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:38,940
I don't have enough.

2215
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
He's already upgraded.

2216
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:48,820
Cool.

2217
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,640
We'll see how it goes.

2218
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,760
Wind blade has good and dealing bleed.

2219
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,040
He said it's good for bleed.

2220
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,020
Okay.

2221
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,040
Alright.

2222
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,180
I'm scared.

2223
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,940
For those who are wondering...

2224
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,780
I mean like...

2225
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,940
This is really fun with friends, for sure.

2226
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,140
Yeah.

2227
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,920
Yeah, this is a fun...

2228
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,720
Like...

2229
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,920
Cause each run is different.

2230
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,480
It's all the RNG.

2231
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,080
So like...

2232
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,000
For everyone who doesn't know...

2233
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,700
The final bosses here are all the same.

2234
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:30,780
In every run...

2235
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,200
It's the same boss.

2236
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,420
That's not RNG.

2237
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,360
And this boss...

2238
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,960
Is so hard.

2239
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,420
Yeah, the pacing of it is kinda nuts.

2240
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,640
I wish I had slightly more time to explore the map.

2241
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:45,740
Like...

2242
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,140
Like...

2243
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,740
Sometimes I feel like we only get to see like...

2244
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,620
A couple points of interest.

2245
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,100
But then again, we haven't routed.

2246
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,980
Yeah, you get to pick the final boss.

2247
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,220
Yeah.

2248
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,160
So like...

2249
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,220
There's like several final bosses to do.

2250
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:57,640
Um...

2251
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,120
But like...

2252
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,640
For those bosses, they're always...

2253
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,340
They're the ones that are the consistent ones.

2254
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,080
We got a little fucked by RNG with the mini bosses.

2255
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,080
But we got a boatload of Estuses.

2256
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:08,880
Yeah!

2257
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,500
I'm gonna eat my crab.

2258
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,340
I hate this guy cause he flies all over the frickin' place.

2259
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:15,740
Jesus!

2260
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,540
What the fuck!

2261
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,220
Okay, I don't remember that move!

2262
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:18,880
You're balls!

2263
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,920
I don't remember that move though.

2264
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,000
Right above.

2265
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,880
Okay, I'm gonna say I can...

2266
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,580
Oh my god.

2267
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:26,420
I can't mark him.

2268
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:26,880
He's two.

2269
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:30,820
Like...

2270
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,460
Ow.

2271
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,980
I'm gonna try to mark him for us.

2272
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:35,660
Look at him.

2273
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,080
I marked him?

2274
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,210
Oh, Zen.

2275
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:43,030
He's on me?

2276
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:43,990
He scares me.

2277
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,630
Ah, late on that one.

2278
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:46,610
He's on me still.

2279
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,270
Coming.

2280
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,510
I have to run across the entire ring.

2281
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:50,670
Jesus!

2282
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:50,670
Stop!

2283
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,810
He's still on me!

2284
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,250
Let me know when you're gonna ult.

2285
01:05:58,770 --> 01:05:59,650
I don't have ult yet.

2286
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,930
I think you have to wait for his Zen's ult too.

2287
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,330
Zen might have hers.

2288
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,190
I can't mark him.

2289
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:07,950
He's like...

2290
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:08,150
Just about.

2291
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:09,790
Oh my god.

2292
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:10,570
Yeah, he's too aggressive.

2293
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:11,770
Towards me.

2294
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,370
I'm gonna try to mark him.

2295
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:16,670
Oh!

2296
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:17,810
I couldn't mark him there.

2297
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:22,920
Jesus.

2298
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,060
Careful, Zen.

2299
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,780
He is poison though.

2300
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:30,730
Oh.

2301
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:31,830
Fire, fire.

2302
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:32,850
Backing up, back it up.

2303
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,330
Now he's three.

2304
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,330
Whoever gets the most dogs, just dodge.

2305
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,790
Yeah, I'll just run.

2306
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,470
If I get the...

2307
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,150
Oh, it's Zen.

2308
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,270
Zen's away!

2309
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,990
We're slowly coming over!

2310
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:49,910
Oh, fuck!

2311
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,630
Oh, I got another dog on me!

2312
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,510
I got a dog in me!

2313
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,850
I have four dogs on me!

2314
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,550
I'm gonna try to concentrate on murdering this one.

2315
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:01,250
Okay, okay.

2316
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:01,990
Yeah, they're all gone.

2317
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:02,930
Okay, if you...

2318
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:03,310
Get rewind!

2319
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,270
Uh, nope.

2320
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,370
I got one shot.

2321
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,130
Holy shit.

2322
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,090
Couldn't see because the other dog was in the way.

2323
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,810
Um, if you could get...

2324
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:11,270
Lime.

2325
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:12,610
I have two of them.

2326
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,430
I have two of them on me.

2327
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,330
Wood!

2328
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:18,410
Okay.

2329
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,810
It sucks because, like, sometimes they just come out of nowhere.

2330
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:23,450
Like, the dogs...

2331
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:28,190
The fireball's annoying because if there's a dog in the way, it's like, good luck seeing it.

2332
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,910
I have my ultimate.

2333
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:29,630
Okay.

2334
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,550
Give me a countdown.

2335
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:33,370
Zombie?

2336
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:33,630
Zombie?

2337
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,470
I can never get to it.

2338
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,210
Use your ultimate if you have to.

2339
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,530
Like, it is what it is.

2340
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,590
Because I'm having trouble.

2341
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:40,150
Okay, I'm on him.

2342
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:45,380
Okay.

2343
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:51,430
Can I mark him?

2344
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,590
No, I couldn't mark him!

2345
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:52,950
Fuck!

2346
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,270
He went for me before I could mark him.

2347
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,330
Are you serious?

2348
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,490
I couldn't even get up!

2349
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,010
Just heal, just heal.

2350
01:07:59,110 --> 01:07:59,350
You guys can.

2351
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,130
I'm only one hit.

2352
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,370
I'm only one hit.

2353
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,250
So I should be fine.

2354
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:05,570
Okay, you're good?

2355
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:06,270
Yeah, I'm good.

2356
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:06,850
Oh, stun.

2357
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:07,390
Nice stun.

2358
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,710
Nice.

2359
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:11,090
I'm marking him.

2360
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,370
I got the mark.

2361
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:15,390
That's good, that's good.

2362
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:16,370
Fireball, fireball!

2363
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,560
Alright, who's gonna be with the most?

2364
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,500
Oh, they're on Zen.

2365
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,100
Oh, it's all on you!

2366
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:26,720
All on you live!

2367
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,380
All on you!

2368
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,540
I have one of them on me.

2369
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,160
I'm okay.

2370
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,140
I just have one.

2371
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,140
I still have one, so it's five.

2372
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,200
They're all on Zen now.

2373
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:41,780
They're all on Zen.

2374
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,100
Oh, careful Zen.

2375
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:45,980
Do you have enough flasks?

2376
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,700
How many flasks do you have left?

2377
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,240
Yes, bitch!

2378
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:51,580
Oh, no.

2379
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,240
Zen is only one.

2380
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,120
I have two on me.

2381
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:54,700
Oh, fuck.

2382
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:55,980
Oh, where's Zen?

2383
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:56,400
I see her.

2384
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,060
I got her, I got her.

2385
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:57,140
Yeah, yeah.

2386
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,440
I have two of them on me.

2387
01:08:59,280 --> 01:08:59,840
Trying to heal.

2388
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,300
Fuck, okay.

2389
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:01,980
I'm backing out.

2390
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,560
I'm trying to back out.

2391
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,160
You can aggro them so I can heal.

2392
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:06,480
Oh, they pull me back.

2393
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,360
He's on me.

2394
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,340
Because I have slow heal.

2395
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,620
I have ult.

2396
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,840
I'm ulting.

2397
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,680
I don't know if you have rewind, but...

2398
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,840
No, come on.

2399
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:16,900
No, I got my ult.

2400
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:17,720
My ult hit you.

2401
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,240
My ult hit you.

2402
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:18,900
My ult hit you.

2403
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,540
That was so good.

2404
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:21,900
Nice.

2405
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,180
Thank God.

2406
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,580
You stood just there with him.

2407
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2408
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,480
He's on me.

2409
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,040
Do not panic.

2410
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,120
He's poison too.

2411
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,860
Zen doesn't have flask anymore.

2412
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,380
I have two though.

2413
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,040
I have two.

2414
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,580
Oh, I have one.

2415
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,300
Use your items if you got them.

2416
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,680
Don't forget.

2417
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,120
I'm gonna have one now.

2418
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:52,390
Fireballs, back up.

2419
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:53,790
He's on you.

2420
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:55,870
Oh.

2421
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:58,270
Okay, I got one on me.

2422
01:09:59,430 --> 01:09:59,810
Oh, no.

2423
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:02,170
They're all three on you.

2424
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:02,610
Three on you.

2425
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:03,350
Three on you.

2426
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:03,830
Three on you.

2427
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:06,910
One on me.

2428
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,450
One on me.

2429
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,470
Dodging, dodging, dodging.

2430
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:10,510
Two on me.

2431
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:11,230
Three on me.

2432
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,630
I'm just running.

2433
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,590
Just stay alive.

2434
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,070
Staying alive.

2435
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,030
I have to recharge stamina.

2436
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:22,550
I always have my ult.

2437
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:27,540
Oh, no.

2438
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,740
I'm gonna try and get Zen if I can.

2439
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:30,460
Okay.

2440
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,180
I'm trying my best.

2441
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,520
So, keep going.

2442
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:32,880
Yeah.

2443
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:34,820
He's one.

2444
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,240
I got you, Zen.

2445
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:39,990
Marking.

2446
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:40,850
I'm gonna try and market this.

2447
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:41,650
I marked him.

2448
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:42,650
He's so low.

2449
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,250
If you killed this guy, he wins.

2450
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:44,610
Yes.

2451
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,630
Yes.

2452
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:45,950
Oh.

2453
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,700
We did it again.

2454
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,620
Oh, we did it.

2455
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,080
I'm on stream.

2456
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,100
What if you're finished here?

2457
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,460
Oh!

2458
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,600
Holy fuck.

2459
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,380
What if you finished?

2460
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,500
Oh my God.

2461
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,420
I don't know how I had the most levels.

2462
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,320
I don't...

2463
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,240
Don't worry if that's fine.

2464
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,820
Oh my God.

2465
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,640
My dog's cheering on me.

2466
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,760
He's so proud of me.

2467
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,460
Yay!

2468
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,160
Yay, Izzy should be.

2469
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,280
Oh my god.

2470
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,000
Guys, we have two other bosses.

2471
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,560
No, honestly, it's fine.

2472
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,040
Because, like, you know, if we lose the other bosses, we've never seen them before.

2473
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,140
Yeah, yeah, guys, we've never seen those two bosses before.

2474
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,160
The others have.

2475
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,260
We don't know what they look like.

2476
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,600
Oh, that was intense.

2477
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,120
That poison was so good.

2478
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,700
I'm so glad I had poison arrow in the end.

2479
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,500
I know, that was really sexy.

2480
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:57,380
And then at one point, I used my ult and got, like, a massive amount of bleed and they were completely ignoring me.

2481
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,360
I got, like, the double trigger.

2482
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,180
It was so hot.

2483
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,300
Oh my god.

2484
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:03,140
Was the dual blades really good for you?

2485
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,640
Yeah, honestly, I think fast attacking with bleed was amazing.

2486
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,740
Because I can, like, immediately proc my ability after the bleed and get, like, a lot of self damage.

2487
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That's good, that's good.

2488
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,120
Oh my god.

2489
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:16,940
That was intense.

2490
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,420
We don't know what goes on in the second or third boss now.

2491
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:20,380
We...

2492
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:21,760
Oh my god.

2493
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,300
When, like, when Nightline...

2494
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,960
When you got knocked down, you were, like, right there in the vicinity of the boss from my ult.

2495
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,220
So that's why it hit you.

2496
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:29,960
It insta-rised you.

2497
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,580
Yeah, I just instantly got back up.

2498
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,040
Yeah, yeah.

2499
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,500
You were literally perfectly aligned to my ult.

2500
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,500
That was fucking great.

2501
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,720
Because I was like, I don't know how we're gonna get you.

2502
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,180
Are you mad?

2503
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,000
Why are you mad?

2504
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:46,940
My dog's mad.

2505
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,620
All the shouting.

2506
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,020
Oh, I'm just glad we didn't die in that run, honestly.

2507
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,220
I'm so...

2508
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,240
From the practice that we've done.

2509
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,440
We didn't go out like bozos in round one.

2510
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,100
That means we are so locked in then.

2511
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,360
Alright, I think he wants to eat.

2512
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,060
I'll be right back, guys.

2513
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,880
I'm gonna feed my dog.

2514
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:24,650
Oh, apparently they're showing highlights and stuff on the stream, so we should go check that out.

2515
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:32,150
Did anybody wipe or everybody passed?

2516
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,350
I don't know.

2517
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:50,920
I'm back.

2518
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,380
I'm glad.

2519
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,600
I'm glad we two teams wiped apparently.

2520
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:55,560
Oh!

2521
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,640
Not us!

2522
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,280
Not us!

2523
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,360
Not us!

2524
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,280
Not us!

2525
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,420
As long as it's not...

2526
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,220
Nah, don't worry.

2527
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,440
Next run, it might be us.

2528
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,540
I'm watching...

2529
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,340
Ooh, these guys went into...

2530
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,020
Is that the mausoleum or is it underneath the castle?

2531
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:16,540
I'm not sure.

2532
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,320
I think after that rough round.

2533
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,180
To be fair, I'm...

2534
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:21,940
I'm glad...

2535
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:23,300
I'm surprised we managed to...

2536
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,140
This is good luck next.

2537
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,500
I'm surprised we managed to make it to the...

2538
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:26,960
To the...

2539
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,280
Like, we managed to win that one.

2540
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,360
Because our RNG was so fucking bad for that run.

2541
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:33,820
Cause like...

2542
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,680
We nailed it.

2543
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,260
We were great.

2544
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,820
Yeah, cause this is the...

2545
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,400
Cause like...

2546
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,260
The fact that we couldn't defeat two bosses for levels.

2547
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,060
And we...

2548
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,500
All of us lost levels too.

2549
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:43,700
Yeah.

2550
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:44,820
We still managed to defeat them.

2551
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,240
I'm very proud of us.

2552
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:47,940
Me too.

2553
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:49,860
Oh.

2554
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:51,140
Thank God.

2555
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,380
I didn't know you could climb up there and do that.

2556
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:52,880
You guys are so wicked.

2557
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,740
They're showing highlights from like the speed running teams.

2558
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,660
And it's like, wait, you can do that?

2559
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,360
Where's the...

2560
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:57,580
Where the...

2561
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,220
Where the frick is the magma worm?

2562
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,280
I have no idea what any of these things are.

2563
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:01,760
They're showing that like...

2564
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,060
Yeah.

2565
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:02,960
I...

2566
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,960
Did you see the prizes?

2567
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,500
They're like, here are the prizes for the first team.

2568
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:06,900
Actually.

2569
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,380
I'm like, yeah, the speed...

2570
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:08,860
Oh, okay.

2571
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,200
Speed runners are getting...

2572
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,040
That's so cool.

2573
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,540
I can't wait to see those at the speed runners place.

2574
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,540
Oh man.

2575
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,780
I'm proud of us though.

2576
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,040
I'm proud that we...

2577
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,080
Yeah.

2578
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,040
That we got that.

2579
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:22,580
We...

2580
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,180
We got...

2581
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,020
We got the one thing.

2582
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,340
We did what we set out to do.

2583
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,400
And then we're gonna kill everything else, of course.

2584
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,200
But...

2585
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:28,660
Yeah.

2586
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,700
The fact that we did it all on stream.

2587
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:31,860
The first boss.

2588
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,260
Live on stream.

2589
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,760
Not off stream.

2590
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:34,820
Not off stream.

2591
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:35,840
Not off stream.

2592
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,320
Not off stream.

2593
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,900
Not off stream.

2594
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:42,560
Apparently, my chalicean, the twin blaze, was actually a really good weapon I pulled for you.

2595
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:43,780
Yeah, no.

2596
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,840
It was so good.

2597
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,740
Uh, the art that I used.

2598
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:47,760
I just started like...

2599
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,200
When I was invisible, I just started flailing on one of the wolves' ass.

2600
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,460
And it did so much damage.

2601
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:51,780
Yeah, yeah.

2602
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,520
Cause of the bleed.

2603
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,580
Cause it was a bleed and poison too.

2604
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:56,660
Yeah.

2605
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,380
Cause I'm pretty sure we were under leveled for that boss.

2606
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,380
I'm fucking sure we were.

2607
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:05,710
Oh.

2608
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:07,990
Yippee!

2609
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,010
We did it!

2610
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:09,750
Yippee!

2611
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:10,430
Yippee!

2612
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:11,470
Woo!

2613
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,850
Pressure mildly reduced.

2614
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:13,730
I...

2615
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:14,150
Yeah.

2616
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,070
We don't know what's going to happen in the next two missions.

2617
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:19,550
So like, if we die, like, it was expected.

2618
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:20,910
Cause we don't know what we're...

2619
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:22,650
What the plan is.

2620
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:26,830
Yeah, people were saying recommended level for the final boss is level 12.

2621
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:29,090
And I was the highest level at level 11.

2622
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:29,550
Only.

2623
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,550
I was 10.

2624
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:31,010
Yeah.

2625
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,270
And Zen was nine.

2626
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,330
We have trouble finding enough levels.

2627
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,370
I need to level...

2628
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:35,390
We obviously need to like...

2629
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:36,510
I don't know, then max it somehow.

2630
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:36,910
Well...

2631
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:37,730
It was just like...

2632
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:39,150
We missed two bosses, remember?

2633
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,510
And we also lost...

2634
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:41,130
Like...

2635
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:41,990
Zen lost two levels.

2636
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:44,030
Zen lost two levels.

2637
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,110
I lost one level.

2638
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,550
So like...

2639
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:47,070
Um...

2640
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,010
I should've been level 12.

2641
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,050
Right, right.

2642
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:51,670
Yeah.

2643
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,990
Oh man, wait, they're showing highlights.

2644
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,970
They're gonna show us fighting like...

2645
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,350
And we still locked in.

2646
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,530
The...

2647
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:58,370
The...

2648
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:00,630
The first guy underneath the castle and then being like, Nope.

2649
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:00,850
Nope.

2650
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,770
Alright, they're showing highlights.

2651
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,110
They better show my all rest.

2652
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,150
That shit was cool.

2653
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:05,830
Yeah.

2654
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:07,370
They're...

2655
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,530
They're showing highlights right now if you go onto the stream.

2656
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:13,890
That shit was cool.

2657
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,090
That was my highlight of the day.

2658
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,450
Or like, they could show highlights of all the bosses chasing me.

2659
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:24,410
Oh...

2660
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:24,850
I see.

2661
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:25,650
Yeah.

2662
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,550
That would be fun.

2663
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:29,010
I liked it when we were trying to leave and that guy was...

2664
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:29,610
Or no...

2665
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:32,710
He was just jumping on you in the exit.

2666
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:33,490
It was like, Please no.

2667
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,110
Yeah.

2668
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:36,310
I was like, Hey!

2669
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,530
I was like, fuck you!

2670
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,150
And then he took it personally.

2671
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,250
I don't know which team they were.

2672
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:44,550
It was Saikuno's team.

2673
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,990
And like, they had like, I don't know.

2674
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,450
A thumbnail left of health on the final boss.

2675
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:48,950
And wiped.

2676
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:50,350
No!

2677
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:50,930
Yeah.

2678
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:53,150
All three of them were dead or...

2679
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:53,330
That's freaking rough.

2680
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:54,330
Who was the last person?

2681
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:55,830
I don't know.

2682
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,150
That lived on their team.

2683
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,130
Aw, that sucks.

2684
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:03,190
You should fill your...

2685
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:03,310
Oh!

2686
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:03,730
Oh!

2687
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:04,930
Apparently...

2688
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:10,310
Apparently if we fill up our weapon slots, the passives for the weapons also stack up.

2689
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:11,690
Oh!

2690
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,550
So we should just...

2691
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,310
So we want to be getting as many weapons as possible.

2692
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:14,550
Yeah.

2693
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,170
So we can collect them for their...

2694
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:16,750
I didn't know that.

2695
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:16,810
Yeah.

2696
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,510
See, I was...

2697
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:19,490
I remember like...

2698
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:19,970
Both hands?

2699
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,250
Yeah, both hands.

2700
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:21,790
Okay.

2701
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:27,730
I remember off stream chat, I was like, I wish I was streaming this so my chat can backseat me right now.

2702
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,530
Yeah.

2703
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:29,290
Yeah.

2704
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:32,510
There's so many games like that where I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing, dude.

2705
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:32,930
Yeah.

2706
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:37,990
I was like, man, if this wasn't early access, my chat could tell me all the...

2707
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:38,770
what to do.

2708
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:43,250
Yeah.

2709
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,930
So we could...

2710
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:46,450
So look, guys, we were so nerfed, guys, but we...

2711
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,490
So grab six weapons then for all the benefits.

2712
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:48,890
Yeah.

2713
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,710
Yeah, basically.

2714
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:50,890
That's what they say.

2715
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:51,250
I didn't know that.

2716
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,430
It's good to know these things because it like people...

2717
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,730
People will go onto the speedrunner stream and...

2718
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:56,750
Yeah.

2719
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:01,890
People who like know the games and then they'll come back and be like, Hey team, secret info on how to actually play.

2720
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:02,890
They said if the...

2721
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,110
If the ability shows...

2722
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,010
I want you guys to know that we did that without...

2723
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:08,370
We would beat this boss without even knowing that.

2724
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,390
Exactly, guys.

2725
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,970
It makes it even more impressive.

2726
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:12,690
We...

2727
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:14,170
We totally nerfed ourselves.

2728
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:16,150
It makes it more impressive and we have no clue what we're doing.

2729
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:22,410
We totally nerfed ourselves on purpose, guys, to show you that anyone can defeat the boss.

2730
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:28,990
Oh, they say if the icon has a hand icon, then you have to wield the weapon for the passive.

2731
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:31,830
But if it doesn't, then the...

2732
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,090
It's a...

2733
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,150
Then it will like...

2734
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,050
It can stack up.

2735
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:35,990
Okay.

2736
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,610
Yeah, it was a flex.

2737
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,170
We just love the challenge.

2738
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:41,870
Should we ready for the next one?

2739
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:42,670
Just so when they're ready.

2740
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:43,890
Oh, I already read it up.

2741
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,110
So it's just Zen.

2742
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:46,190
Do you know which one it's supposed to be?

2743
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:46,910
No.

2744
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:47,630
Okay.

2745
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:49,690
Zen, do you know what?

2746
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,230
Zen's the only one that needs to know which one it is.

2747
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2748
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:54,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2749
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:57,390
Wait, Zen, you played a beta.

2750
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,190
You didn't know that?

2751
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:00,090
You didn't know about the passive stacks?

2752
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:02,390
The weapon stacks?

2753
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:03,770
Apparently it was in beta.

2754
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,370
Oops.

2755
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:07,570
Oops.

2756
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,970
Wait, no, Lime, you played a beta too!

2757
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:11,070
No, I didn't.

2758
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:11,730
Oh, you didn't?

2759
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,330
I never played.

2760
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,990
Oh, wait, I thought you said you liked...

2761
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,870
I remember you said you liked the Duchess.

2762
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,190
Or something before.

2763
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,370
No, I said she looked cool.

2764
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:18,790
Oh!

2765
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:20,010
She totally played.

2766
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,650
Wait, Bandai is in my chat to give me tips!

2767
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:24,750
I remember, she totally played.

2768
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,050
Whoa, Bandai!

2769
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:26,210
Yeah, you know what?

2770
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:26,890
I love tips!

2771
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:26,990
I love tips!

2772
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,250
I'm gaslighting us!

2773
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:30,770
No!

2774
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:31,870
I've never played...

2775
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,970
I've played all the same games, but I haven't played this.

2776
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,250
Wait, how come you're giving her tips, but not me?

2777
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:36,590
You don't need tips, Zen.

2778
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,210
You're too good.

2779
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,090
That messed up.

2780
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:41,470
Hot tip, hot tip, don't die.

2781
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,550
Okay, well, I'm banning Bandai Namco US.

2782
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:43,990
Sorry.

2783
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,070
Bandai, I'll never ban you.

2784
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,310
I'll always support you.

2785
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,410
And I'm always free to do any sponsor you want me to do.

2786
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,090
Hit me up.

2787
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,030
I'll even mod you.

2788
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:01,370
Wait, wait, wait.

2789
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:02,590
Mod for sponsor.

2790
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:05,630
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2791
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:06,870
No, no, no, no, no.

2792
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:11,030
Oh, man.

2793
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:14,190
You typed really fast.

2794
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:19,050
I wonder if...

2795
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,790
Is there any other teams that are still going?

2796
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:22,870
No, we were the last ones.

2797
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,030
Were we the last ones?

2798
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:24,550
Oh, okay.

2799
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:25,950
Yeah, we were the last ones to finish.

2800
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,050
That's right.

2801
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:29,230
Wait, that means everybody watched us.

2802
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,050
Apparently, we were on the stream at the very end.

2803
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:33,570
There it is.

2804
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:34,290
Yeah!

2805
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,090
Everyone watched us.

2806
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:39,710
Let's go.

2807
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,490
Which is Libra?

2808
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:45,710
Good question.

2809
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:50,250
I feel like the names you were given, I don't know which ones they are for the missions.

2810
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:53,050
Um, I think you might have to ask them then.

2811
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,610
Maybe Chad knows.

2812
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,770
Guys, do you guys know which mission is the Libra one?

2813
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:58,390
I don't want you to do it.

2814
01:21:58,690 --> 01:21:59,770
Chad hasn't seen it.

2815
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:02,930
No, I'm showing them the...

2816
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:05,910
I'm showing them all the names of the missions.

2817
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:07,250
That one.

2818
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,330
It says something related to a goat.

2819
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,790
Oh, yeah, because it's a Libra.

2820
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,490
The goat man with the eyes.

2821
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:13,850
Yeah.

2822
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:14,730
Pointing.

2823
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:15,430
Pointing.

2824
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,190
Yeah, that one.

2825
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,210
Equilibrious beast says Bandai Namco.

2826
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,490
A little bit of a late start, but it's fine.

2827
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:20,610
Thank you Bandai Namco!

2828
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:21,730
Yay!

2829
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:24,010
Yeah, Libra is goat.

2830
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:24,870
Oh wait, are we going?

2831
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:25,270
Oh shit.

2832
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:29,230
Um, so this is our first time in this mission.

2833
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,910
So good luck to us.

2834
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,510
I believe in us.

2835
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:34,670
Yeah.

2836
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,090
I have complete and utter faith.

2837
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,150
How long is the average run?

2838
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:42,650
An hour.

2839
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,690
And then the next one will be that one.

2840
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,350
Okay.

2841
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,880
Is it a different map?

2842
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,460
I don't know.

2843
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,140
We've never tried the other missions before.

2844
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,260
Yeah, this is the first time we've seen any of this.

2845
01:22:58,900 --> 01:22:59,300
Yeah.

2846
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,200
If we can beat the first one, we can do the second one.

2847
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,540
We're just going to first try the boss.

2848
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,260
Don't worry about it.

2849
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:17,960
Yeah, we got this.

2850
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:18,880
No, I think...

2851
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,600
Is this the same map?

2852
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,420
I think so, right?

2853
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:22,720
Guys, I have bad news.

2854
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:22,960
Yeah.

2855
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:23,140
What?

2856
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:23,760
What's that?

2857
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,140
What is it?

2858
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:28,840
I have to go pee.

2859
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:29,600
Oh.

2860
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:29,920
No.

2861
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:30,660
Wait.

2862
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:32,360
I'm sorry, you don't get to go pee.

2863
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,780
They say that, like, if you hold your pee, you play better.

2864
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,100
That's true.

2865
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,220
No, it's actually true.

2866
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,660
The tension and anxiety of it.

2867
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:39,780
Yeah.

2868
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,780
You're not like this?

2869
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,840
It'll be good for you.

2870
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,120
Everybody?

2871
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,860
I'm doing my little pee dance.

2872
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,200
Don't mind me just picking up tons of weapons now.

2873
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,020
Okay, we gotta find...

2874
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:00,540
Find...

2875
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,940
Find some bosses.

2876
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,800
My game crashed!

2877
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:05,880
Oh, shoot.

2878
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:06,760
That's nice.

2879
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,220
Can I get back in?

2880
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:09,900
I don't know, can you?

2881
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:10,560
I don't know.

2882
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:11,300
I...

2883
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,500
Yeah, no, it tries to restore session.

2884
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,060
Come back in.

2885
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2886
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,200
We need to get in here.

2887
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:16,700
Yeah.

2888
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:18,060
Uh, then we should just keep running.

2889
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:18,680
Yeah, just keep running.

2890
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,340
Just keep running.

2891
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,540
And then we'll see how it goes.

2892
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,120
No!

2893
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,260
There's gonna be a boss here, right?

2894
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,300
I need to absent my Travis!

2895
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,020
You literally just flew across the screen.

2896
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:30,640
No!

2897
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,400
It's cause I told her to hold in her pee!

2898
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,720
She said adios.

2899
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,480
Guys, don't update your drivers.

2900
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:38,980
Giant Red!

2901
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:39,380
Giant Red!

2902
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,960
I got guilt-tripped into updating my drivers, guys.

2903
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:50,220
I will say, I got guilt-tripped into updating my drivers.

2904
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,620
Uh, I think the Guardian Golem might be above us.

2905
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:54,400
Then we should run off.

2906
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,080
Not like this.

2907
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,220
I'm trying to...

2908
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,340
Uh, please use when you wish value.

2909
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,020
Yeah, I'll be right up there.

2910
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:02,760
Can I reconnect?

2911
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:08,610
Oh!

2912
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:10,570
Okay.

2913
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:13,410
If I'm beating your driver doesn't work, clearly what you have to do is upgrade to Windows 11.

2914
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,390
Wait, I think I'm coming back in.

2915
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:17,650
Okay!

2916
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:19,050
I think I am.

2917
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:19,090
I think I am.

2918
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,310
Where the frick is this Golem?

2919
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:20,830
Don't worry!

2920
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:22,230
Free souls!

2921
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:27,970
Oh my god, I hope it like gives me the souls you guys were farming.

2922
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:28,890
Oh yes!

2923
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,610
I'm at 480!

2924
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:32,570
Did you got... did I...

2925
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,510
Oh my god, where am I?

2926
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:34,590
I...

2927
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:36,010
I'm coming over.

2928
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:37,230
I still can't find the Golem.

2929
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:38,350
We have found no boss.

2930
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:40,390
I don't know where he is.

2931
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:42,430
Hold on.

2932
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:43,190
Is he like up the stairs?

2933
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:45,710
I'm gonna go looking for him.

2934
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,810
We'll farm...

2935
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:50,890
We'll farm some mini stuff because I don't think I got the souls when I disconnected.

2936
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:52,470
I think he's in there.

2937
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,270
I think he's at the top.

2938
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,690
I don't know how to get there.

2939
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,810
Okay, I'm gonna level up right now.

2940
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:58,350
Oh, you...

2941
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,150
You found him?

2942
01:25:59,290 --> 01:25:59,950
I didn't find him.

2943
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:01,950
Okay, I'm level 2 now.

2944
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:02,450
How do you get to him?

2945
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:05,550
Wait, where are you guys?

2946
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:07,090
In a castle.

2947
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,070
I am...

2948
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,870
Wait, up top?

2949
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:14,230
Yeah, there's like a Golem up top.

2950
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,330
Don't know how to get to it.

2951
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,650
Hope this helps.

2952
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:18,570
Okay, I'm figuring how to get inside.

2953
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,880
I'm like...

2954
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,760
I can hear it.

2955
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:28,600
Okay.

2956
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:30,640
Oh, I see Zen beating him up.

2957
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,080
It's okay, we can get...

2958
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:32,360
I see him!

2959
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:33,500
Coming!

2960
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:35,520
Um...

2961
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,280
I'm not there.

2962
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,800
I'm trying to figure out how to get inside.

2963
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,980
Oh no, I might not get that level up.

2964
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,840
I think you get the level.

2965
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,000
No, but I don't get the level up though.

2966
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,920
Wait, I'm lost.

2967
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,040
I don't know how you guys got there.

2968
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,720
I went around the castle.

2969
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,000
How do you get in?

2970
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:57,740
Awkward.

2971
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:58,780
Uh...

2972
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,400
Through the sewers.

2973
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:00,260
Sewers?

2974
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:02,100
Yeah.

2975
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,180
Oh my god.

2976
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,020
To the window.

2977
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,540
I'm going through the sewers right now.

2978
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,320
To the walls.

2979
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,660
Fuck it, I'm not going to take the...

2980
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,660
And then you go up and up the intersection.

2981
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,180
No, let's just move on.

2982
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:13,400
Because I don't want to waste time.

2983
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,240
Okay, let's do this camp then.

2984
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:16,980
I'm here.

2985
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,290
It's fine.

2986
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:24,780
I think it's just an...

2987
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:26,050
Um...

2988
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:26,860
I think it's just like...

2989
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:29,110
Uh...

2990
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,370
Just an item, right?

2991
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:31,310
Mostly.

2992
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,030
Because usually the first boss is just an item.

2993
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,110
Yeah.

2994
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:37,590
It was a...

2995
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:38,190
It was a...

2996
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:38,990
It was a...

2997
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,770
So it's alright.

2998
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:46,340
Alright.

2999
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,160
Where's the next boss?

3000
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,100
Because we have to...

3001
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:50,800
We have to grab...

3002
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,140
The night tie is growing stronger.

3003
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,180
We only killed one boss.

3004
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:57,980
And we need to...

3005
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,340
This is going to be another rough round.

3006
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,880
We need to get a flask too.

3007
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:03,220
Oh god.

3008
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,180
Are we in the ring?

3009
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,440
We're not in the ring for this.

3010
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,680
So we have to kill it fast with Zen.

3011
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,200
Yep.

3012
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,480
I'm stuck on fucking rock.

3013
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:12,820
Where's the...

3014
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:13,940
Where's the boss for this?

3015
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,540
It's a group.

3016
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,460
It's the red main knight.

3017
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,300
So we just gotta kill everything.

3018
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:18,900
Nothing...

3019
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:19,420
Oh wait, here?

3020
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,540
I think we can do it.

3021
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,260
Yep.

3022
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,200
Wait, nothing is lowering HP though for me.

3023
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,060
It's full HP for me.

3024
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,580
Unless it's these guys.

3025
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,280
Oh, it's these guys.

3026
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:35,960
It's a big guy.

3027
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:36,460
Okay.

3028
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:37,960
What the fuck?

3029
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,000
I need him.

3030
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,020
I need him.

3031
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:41,560
I see him.

3032
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,160
I'm gonna...

3033
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:47,240
Nice.

3034
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,320
We're gonna find one more.

3035
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:49,560
Good stuff.

3036
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,600
Oh, he got fiended.

3037
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,680
Is this one?

3038
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,480
No.

3039
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,740
I hope that guy's not all the way up there.

3040
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,280
Yeah.

3041
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,440
Where is the last one?

3042
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,320
I don't see him.

3043
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:04,000
I don't see him.

3044
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,580
Oh my god!

3045
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:05,300
Who is...

3046
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,080
He's way up here.

3047
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:06,760
I think.

3048
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,960
Who is throwing the purple?

3049
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,400
Oh, there's a guy with a bow and arrow up there.

3050
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,020
Jesus!

3051
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,600
Bro, fuck that guy.

3052
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,620
Like, it's hitting me.

3053
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,760
I don't know how to get up there.

3054
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,860
How did you get up there, Zen?

3055
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:20,840
How did you get up there, Zen?

3056
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:21,420
Oh, it's from here.

3057
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,140
Oh no!

3058
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,360
Alright.

3059
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,280
Good luck, guys.

3060
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:32,880
Kill him!

3061
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,420
Nice.

3062
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,060
We did it!

3063
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:35,400
Yay!

3064
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,320
We did it.

3065
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,880
Oh, there's a...

3066
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,560
Oh...

3067
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,080
There's the number of runes obtained.

3068
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,540
Oh, I got, uh, fire claw for you.

3069
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,560
I can hear...

3070
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,300
I can hear the...

3071
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:53,640
Thank you.

3072
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,860
I can hear the thing coming and we should do it over there though.

3073
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:56,420
Okay.

3074
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,040
Running, running, running, running, running, running...

3075
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,300
Uh, there is an Estus here, where I pinned.

3076
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,680
There's actually one here as well.

3077
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,680
Oh, there's three.

3078
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,080
I didn't see them, but we can still get to two.

3079
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

3080
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,320
We need at least two.

3081
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,540
Oh god, I don't see a way.

3082
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:17,900
I'm following Zen.

3083
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:23,990
Oh no.

3084
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:25,690
Zen and I might die.

3085
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,210
Yeah, I know that feel.

3086
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:28,270
Oh no.

3087
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,630
Dude, there's no way to get up.

3088
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:31,390
Oh, I might die to Zen.

3089
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,470
I found my way.

3090
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,630
Oh, why did I follow Zen?

3091
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:38,710
Oh, why did I follow you, Zen?

3092
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:41,490
Oh, and I'm gonna lose my runes!

3093
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,670
I knew it.

3094
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:46,050
Follow a lamb.

3095
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:49,490
Oh...

3096
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,670
I lose my runes too, because I couldn't level up.

3097
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:54,170
I'm so sad.

3098
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:55,130
I was led astray.

3099
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:57,010
I was led astray by the false prophet.

3100
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:01,890
I thought he was... I thought Zen was captain.

3101
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:05,770
So she knows where to go.

3102
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:08,930
The false prophet.

3103
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:11,270
Of course I die.

3104
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:12,030
The captain survives.

3105
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:13,470
Let's go.

3106
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:15,770
I lost 28k runes and I'm level one.

3107
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,510
Uh, if you get to where I am...

3108
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,250
I'm not going down with the ship.

3109
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,210
There is a... an altar.

3110
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,330
Oh, and a big dragon.

3111
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:25,610
Um, I can't help much because I'm level one.

3112
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:26,830
Oh dear.

3113
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:30,230
Where is the... where is it, Lyme?

3114
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:32,210
Uh, my mark.

3115
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:35,210
I don't see the mark.

3116
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:37,410
I'm level one!

3117
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:38,690
I didn't get to...

3118
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:40,970
Yeah, Kazuki got disconnected, do you remember?

3119
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:41,830
Yeah.

3120
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,150
Wait, where is it?

3121
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:44,710
Mine?

3122
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:45,630
The flats?

3123
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,830
Yeah, that's why.

3124
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:47,510
There.

3125
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:48,450
Oh, I see it.

3126
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,110
Yeah, and there was no grace.

3127
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:52,330
It's always the same building if you can get to it.

3128
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:55,130
There was no grace with... next to that first boss we killed.

3129
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:55,650
Don't worry.

3130
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:57,010
We will protect you.

3131
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,170
I'm so sad.

3132
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:02,570
I'm so sad.

3133
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:02,810
Yay.

3134
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:06,710
We could try and kill the dragon, but I vote we go and fight somewhere to spend our souls.

3135
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:11,250
Um, I have nothing... I can't spend... I need 3,000 souls to be level two.

3136
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:11,890
Yeah, me as well.

3137
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,730
Because I only have 400.

3138
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,650
Let's hurry up and get up there.

3139
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:23,630
You know what?

3140
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,210
I will always fall alive.

3141
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:27,670
Never follow Zen again.

3142
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,830
Zen is famous for her sense of direction.

3143
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,510
Actually, my sense of direction is usually terrible.

3144
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:34,570
Yeah, but you live.

3145
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:34,750
I got lucky.

3146
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:35,810
Yeah.

3147
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:40,810
I need, like, more runes because I'm, like, only at 400.

3148
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,630
Uh, there might be someone in here.

3149
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:44,930
What the fuck?

3150
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:45,470
But I'm gonna go get this thing.

3151
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,750
I actually need... I need, like, um...

3152
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,230
That should count towards something.

3153
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:54,950
I can't level up, though.

3154
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,550
We need to fight a boss, because I...

3155
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:59,870
Uh, this thing probably has something.

3156
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:01,030
We're very under...

3157
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:03,570
Like, I think overall we're very under leveled.

3158
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:12,800
Oh, it's these...

3159
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,520
Where's the boxes?

3160
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:15,660
I don't know.

3161
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,020
We're looking.

3162
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:16,920
Oh, okay.

3163
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,140
Yeah, I'm trying to find if there's anything here.

3164
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,620
Isn't I just saw a tunnel?

3165
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,200
Yeah, but the...

3166
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,280
Oh, wait, there is a tunnel.

3167
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:25,580
Yeah.

3168
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,820
Uh, I found a thing, but I don't think it's a boss.

3169
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,140
No, it's just...

3170
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,720
Oh my god, I'm so under leveled!

3171
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,630
Ugh.

3172
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:40,970
Oh, what the fuck?

3173
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:41,830
I'm still looking for stuff.

3174
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:43,790
I just want...

3175
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,250
Okay, I can level up.

3176
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:46,450
Oh, castle's here.

3177
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:47,390
Do you wanna go to the castle?

3178
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:48,270
Alright.

3179
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:50,190
Where are you?

3180
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,290
We can do that.

3181
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:52,850
Yeah.

3182
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:55,550
Oh, there's also this thing here.

3183
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:56,710
But, did we go here?

3184
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:57,990
Oh my god!

3185
01:33:58,190 --> 01:33:58,770
I don't know if we went here.

3186
01:33:58,890 --> 01:33:59,670
I'm a giant here.

3187
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:02,550
I'm a little lost.

3188
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:03,750
I don't know where you guys are.

3189
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:05,450
Uh, look at the map.

3190
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:05,950
I have an icon.

3191
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:08,790
Wait, are you green or blue?

3192
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:11,150
Uh, I'm not sure.

3193
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:15,270
I'm green.

3194
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:17,670
Okay, I'm gonna go to Lime.

3195
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,630
Wait, Lime, are you the one fighting...

3196
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,570
boss right now?

3197
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:20,870
Yes!

3198
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,990
Yes!

3199
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:22,330
Okay, I'm heading over.

3200
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,160
Nice!

3201
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,460
I was there.

3202
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:35,840
Good stuff.

3203
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,240
I got one of the bosses.

3204
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,540
I'm helping Lime with the other one.

3205
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:40,760
Wait, does it...

3206
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,980
Do you have level ups with that boss?

3207
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:42,520
Zen?

3208
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,620
Is there like a level up item there?

3209
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,980
Yeah, I loved up.

3210
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:50,040
I'm going over to Zen.

3211
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,640
I need to level up.

3212
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,720
Sorry, Lime!

3213
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,300
Okay.

3214
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,600
I need this more.

3215
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:00,720
Yippee!

3216
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,740
Where's that level up item?

3217
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,600
Zen, you false prophet!

3218
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,020
You false prophet!

3219
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,400
So, oops!

3220
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,520
I almost died to the ring again without lifting up!

3221
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:36,620
About to do this fast as the ring is closing.

3222
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:43,760
Okay, I'm level three.

3223
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,520
I'm very...

3224
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:45,560
Good job!

3225
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,780
Very under level.

3226
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:48,780
She's doing it.

3227
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,980
Uh, there's one more Estus here.

3228
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:53,840
She's beginning to believe.

3229
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,680
I'm not.

3230
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,880
I'm not believing anymore.

3231
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,000
We should grab that before we go.

3232
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,360
I feel like such a baby.

3233
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,500
No, we're not gonna get there in time.

3234
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:14,980
Yeah.

3235
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,660
I don't know.

3236
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:18,440
I'm feeling pretty confident about this run now.

3237
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,460
Wait, I still have...

3238
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,140
Do you still want the claws I got for you?

3239
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,360
I don't know if you have a better weapon though.

3240
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,640
Uh, I have no idea if I have a better weapon.

3241
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,520
What level of the claws?

3242
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:28,860
Wait, can we...

3243
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,680
Oh, can we even kill this boss in time or no?

3244
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:32,560
Uh, no, I'm running fast.

3245
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,120
Okay.

3246
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:34,880
Personally, I don't know.

3247
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,480
No, I believe you.

3248
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,080
You got to go.

3249
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:37,820
Yeah.

3250
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,160
No, I believe you.

3251
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:42,400
Oh my God.

3252
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,660
I've never been level three for the first run.

3253
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,000
Bastards.

3254
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:47,420
No.

3255
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,000
We can get it for it.

3256
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:51,720
We can get it on day two.

3257
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,720
Oh, icky hand, icky hand, icky hand, icky hand.

3258
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,200
I hate that.

3259
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,240
These are my least favorite things in the entire world.

3260
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:57,580
Oh, yeah.

3261
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:58,780
I'm very weak, by the way.

3262
01:36:59,260 --> 01:36:59,640
So, like...

3263
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,500
Wait, what the fuck is this?

3264
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:01,880
Oh, big hand!

3265
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,100
I have to help this.

3266
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,120
I got the extra flask.

3267
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,220
What the fuck is going on with my weapons?

3268
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:08,040
Wait, how did you get the extra flask?

3269
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:08,260
I fucked up.

3270
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,280
Did you go inside the...

3271
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,080
Oh no, I know what I did.

3272
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:10,900
That sucks.

3273
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:11,460
What?

3274
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,140
I fucked up.

3275
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,680
Yeah, I went to go get it.

3276
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,120
I mean, the flask will still be there, so...

3277
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,920
We can grab it on day two.

3278
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,380
I accidentally used magic.

3279
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,280
I feel dirty.

3280
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:26,480
Alright.

3281
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,240
No!

3282
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:30,700
You get it.

3283
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,540
It can heal you.

3284
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:32,240
Send a beat demon!

3285
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:32,760
Oh god!

3286
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,340
I've never seen him before!

3287
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,860
I marked one of the heads.

3288
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,780
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

3289
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,420
I don't know how much damage I am contributing.

3290
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:51,140
But like...

3291
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:51,540
I am trying.

3292
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,440
You're doing great, sweetie.

3293
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,480
As a level three.

3294
01:37:57,820 --> 01:37:58,980
Oh my god!

3295
01:37:59,260 --> 01:37:59,580
Okay.

3296
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:00,960
I marked him first.

3297
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:01,500
Oh, ew.

3298
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:02,100
What is this?

3299
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:02,780
I marked him?

3300
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:06,700
Oh!

3301
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:07,260
Oh!

3302
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,120
Oh!

3303
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:08,180
Oh!

3304
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:09,120
Oh!

3305
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:09,240
Oh!

3306
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:09,900
Dead.

3307
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:10,680
Okay.

3308
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:14,890
Who's...

3309
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:15,870
Is it me with the poison?

3310
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:16,430
I don't know.

3311
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,910
I didn't check my stuff.

3312
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:19,190
Uh...

3313
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:19,850
I don't know if it's me.

3314
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:20,310
I'm sorry.

3315
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:20,770
Hold on.

3316
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:23,350
Oh, it...

3317
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:23,770
It's me.

3318
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:24,370
Oh, it's you?

3319
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:25,010
Okay.

3320
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:25,850
Nice.

3321
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:27,430
I'm gonna mark him for us.

3322
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:30,570
He's marked?

3323
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:31,770
It's the center head.

3324
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:35,630
Oh, now it's a body.

3325
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:36,110
It's a body.

3326
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,530
When you hit that body, you get more damage in.

3327
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:42,050
I have ult.

3328
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:42,790
Do you have to rewind?

3329
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,630
Yeah.

3330
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:45,170
Okay.

3331
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:46,170
I'm ulting this?

3332
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:46,730
Big damage.

3333
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:47,910
Ult it?

3334
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:51,010
I staggered him with it.

3335
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:51,930
He went down.

3336
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:54,270
And I...

3337
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:55,010
And I marked him too.

3338
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:57,910
Ow.

3339
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:02,050
He's...

3340
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:08,010
I got real scared about how far that was going.

3341
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:08,790
Yeah, me too.

3342
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:09,990
I don't remember this guy at all.

3343
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:11,090
I just have instant hit, I feel like.

3344
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:14,690
Whoa!

3345
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,350
Nice, we did it.

3346
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,840
Someone's like, cut off his tail!

3347
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:26,700
It's just that easy.

3348
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:40,400
I remember this inflict bloodloss when HP is successive attacks.

3349
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,680
Do I do a successive attacks, chat?

3350
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,140
Does the bow do that?

3351
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:44,680
Or no?

3352
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,640
Quick, carve the tail!

3353
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,420
Wrong game, guys.

3354
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,080
Wrong game.

3355
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:54,600
Yes?

3356
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:55,240
Okay.

3357
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:57,500
Try that.

3358
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,320
Thanks, chat.

3359
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:01,240
I love having chat to backseat me and pick my stuff.

3360
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,720
Uh, so there's Estus here.

3361
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,900
Actually, there's Estus here, which is further out, so we should go there first.

3362
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,820
I'm gonna get to the one in front of me first.

3363
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,800
The one in front of you?

3364
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:13,360
Yeah.

3365
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:15,220
The one where Zen and I are at.

3366
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,060
The one, the one I trust.

3367
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:18,520
Oh wait, we spawned on one, okay.

3368
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,240
Oh yeah, because I was there last time.

3369
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,960
Okay, we grab that, then we go to the marker.

3370
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:23,260
Uh, on the...

3371
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,620
Actually, uh...

3372
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:25,560
There's a jail cell.

3373
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,460
We should do, we should do jail after the Estus.

3374
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,680
We have five Estus.

3375
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,380
I think six is, like, the optimal.

3376
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,460
Yeah, so we go to the other Estus, and then we collapse in and get the jail.

3377
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:41,600
What were the...

3378
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,140
Oh god.

3379
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:44,380
All the enemies are in the center, dude.

3380
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,480
What were the black marking ones again?

3381
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:48,820
I don't remember.

3382
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:49,980
Hm?

3383
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:51,220
You see the map?

3384
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:52,380
There's, like, it's, like, black.

3385
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:53,420
The shining ones.

3386
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:53,960
Black circles?

3387
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,120
The black shining things on our map.

3388
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,980
Uh, I don't know which one you mean.

3389
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,400
Like, the black one with the red outline?

3390
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,300
What are those?

3391
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,700
Oh, those are, those are the big bosses.

3392
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:05,460
Oh, okay.

3393
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:06,400
So we can do those, but...

3394
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,820
They're the harder ones, so if we're behind, it might, like, you know, death spiral.

3395
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:11,080
Oh, oh, like...

3396
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,300
We might not, like, have enough levels for it.

3397
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,880
Yeah, we might not be strong enough, and it might be a waste.

3398
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,040
I get it.

3399
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:24,440
You guys say it's three realms?

3400
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,320
It's three bosses, right?

3401
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:27,440
Huh?

3402
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,840
It's, uh, three different, uh...

3403
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,100
Yes.

3404
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,120
Expeditions, yeah.

3405
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:32,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3406
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:36,160
So this one is the second one, and then we have one more after that.

3407
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:39,900
Okay.

3408
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:47,320
Yippee!

3409
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:52,320
I keep trying to keep an eye out for little glowing buffs, because those have things like, you know, increased runes.

3410
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:52,700
Yeah.

3411
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:54,160
Uh, got me, which is nice.

3412
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:54,980
All right, last, last.

3413
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:55,380
Yeah.

3414
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:55,420
Yeah.

3415
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,580
And then there's that here.

3416
01:41:57,780 --> 01:41:59,360
I think we get that, and then we go into the jail.

3417
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,440
Because I have...

3418
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,060
Mm-hmm.

3419
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,100
Whoa!

3420
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,160
Whoa, I did not...

3421
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,740
I thought that was said for some reason.

3422
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:10,400
One of my chat members says, this reminds me of Elden Ring.

3423
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:11,460
Yeah!

3424
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,240
Just a little bit of tomfoolery.

3425
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:18,240
Oh my god, you're so ahead of us.

3426
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,100
I'm trying to...

3427
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,000
Yeah, I don't know...

3428
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,420
I don't understand this ruin, if there's something here.

3429
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,340
Oh, this is the place where I couldn't find anything.

3430
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,500
Fuck this place, I'm going to the jail.

3431
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,040
All right.

3432
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,240
I'm just following that.

3433
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,320
Oh, I thought I fucked up.

3434
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,080
Getting from some vibes, hell yeah.

3435
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:36,420
What?

3436
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,300
Where am I?

3437
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:38,500
Oh my god.

3438
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:42,540
Guys, I might be behind.

3439
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,520
Uh, I'm going to wait for you guys to pop this jail.

3440
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:46,640
All right, you guys are going to fight that jail cell.

3441
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,600
I'm sure she's going to be all right.

3442
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,620
You're going to fight that jail cell without me.

3443
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,860
You can get here in time, I believe in you.

3444
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:53,840
Hit it.

3445
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,160
Don't worry, I'm all...

3446
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:56,720
Yeah, just hit it.

3447
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,980
Hit the jail cell.

3448
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:58,840
I'm heading over.

3449
01:42:58,980 --> 01:42:59,620
I fucked up.

3450
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,480
I fell down a hole.

3451
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,820
I don't know how I got there.

3452
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,220
I'm here!

3453
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:08,980
Ow.

3454
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:10,440
Hello, guys.

3455
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:11,700
Hey.

3456
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:12,520
Did y'all miss me?

3457
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:13,800
Yes.

3458
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:15,360
There you go, I marked him.

3459
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:17,360
You should be able to do more damage than I got.

3460
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:26,130
Nice.

3461
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:28,470
They're nice too, on her.

3462
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:29,950
Hey, Zen, you having fun?

3463
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:30,530
I'm gonna ult this.

3464
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:32,450
They are slowly poisoning to death, which is crazy.

3465
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:33,450
There you go.

3466
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,330
If you have rewind.

3467
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:38,110
I don't think I was close enough for rewind to work.

3468
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:38,690
I don't know.

3469
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:41,750
Oh, crap.

3470
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:44,850
Marked?

3471
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:47,330
He should be able to close.

3472
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,530
Oh, shit!

3473
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:50,370
I got him, I got him.

3474
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:50,650
Nice.

3475
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,170
There's one more on Zen.

3476
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,580
Coming for Zen.

3477
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,420
Got you.

3478
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:00,900
I used to dead.

3479
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:02,680
Oh my god, Zen, you were one HP.

3480
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,520
Did you hookshot to him and then he fucking just exploded you?

3481
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:08,800
Raises potency of sorcery?

3482
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,020
No, I need 10,000.

3483
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,020
I'm so behind.

3484
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,020
I need these runes.

3485
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,240
Fuck you.

3486
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:18,180
We could try this guy, but I think the ring's gonna come in.

3487
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:19,660
So, I don't know.

3488
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:22,120
Alright.

3489
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,600
Oh, he's a little lizard.

3490
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,520
Kill the lizard.

3491
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,280
We can give it a try at least.

3492
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,620
I think we've got just enough time.

3493
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,300
Yeah, yeah.

3494
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,680
I already used my ult, so I just don't have my ult.

3495
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:32,480
Oh, there it goes.

3496
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,760
Yeah, we gotta get this bad in.

3497
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:38,240
Just stay behind him, because he likes doing a lot of things behind in front of him.

3498
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,040
Mike McGaWyrm!

3499
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:45,170
I can go closer and mark it for us.

3500
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:47,390
Oh, fuck!

3501
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,350
Nevermind!

3502
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:48,810
Guys!

3503
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:50,990
I think we go because we're not doing any damage.

3504
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:52,250
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!

3505
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,990
Don't let me don't know!

3506
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:54,530
Guys, I'm coming for you!

3507
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:55,190
I'm coming for you!

3508
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:55,830
I'm coming for you!

3509
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:56,650
Guys, please!

3510
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,390
Don't make me lose another level!

3511
01:44:58,950 --> 01:44:59,310
Run!

3512
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:00,650
I'm running!

3513
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,150
I'm running!

3514
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:02,930
I'm running!

3515
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,950
Don't say goodbye, Doki!

3516
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:07,950
Zen, I'm gonna remember that when you...

3517
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:09,250
When you get down!

3518
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:10,870
I am not shooting my arrow!

3519
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:13,430
I am not shooting my arrow to res you, Zen!

3520
01:45:13,630 --> 01:45:15,130
Just remember that first run!

3521
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:16,050
Ah,

3522
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,430
I'm heading to the castle if you wanna get the guy underneath.

3523
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:26,210
Doki will remember that.

3524
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:28,870
I will absolutely remember that.

3525
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:31,450
There's another Estus on the inside.

3526
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:34,510
Me, when I make all the wrong decisions.

3527
01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:40,810
Uh, I think we can get over here.

3528
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,790
Yay.

3529
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:45,050
Hey, buddy.

3530
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:47,670
These guys are always in the same place too, which is cool.

3531
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:48,430
Yeah.

3532
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:52,850
Oh, you want to go into the castle, all right.

3533
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:54,310
All right.

3534
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:56,290
Yeah, yeah, I'm going down underneath the castle.

3535
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:57,170
We can get that boss there.

3536
01:45:57,810 --> 01:45:59,830
Because there's also, there's always that chest as well afterwards.

3537
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:00,630
Yeah, that's true.

3538
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:02,130
Items and stuff.

3539
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:02,490
Yeah.

3540
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:03,870
Good idea.

3541
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,220
Oh, hey, buddy.

3542
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:12,860
Are you serious?

3543
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:20,200
I'm not having a very... Dogeberry is having a terrible, a terrible no good day.

3544
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,180
Then he farted all over him and now I can't see him.

3545
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:22,660
There he is.

3546
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:23,600
Oh my god.

3547
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:25,200
I didn't lock him for that.

3548
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:32,790
Nice.

3549
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:33,830
I'll mark him too.

3550
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:38,190
Oh, that was a lot of damage.

3551
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:39,010
I can ult this too.

3552
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:39,430
That was a rewind.

3553
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:40,370
That was pretty hot.

3554
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:42,050
I can ult this too.

3555
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:46,840
Got the ult.

3556
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:49,440
Nice.

3557
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:49,860
Yeah!

3558
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:55,380
Fudging beautiful.

3559
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:58,360
Do I do crit... I do do critical hits, right?

3560
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,440
Oh, I have a good weapon for Zen, but I'm not going to get it.

3561
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:10,390
Zen, do you want this really good weapon that I have that's purple?

3562
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:14,850
Say you're sorry.

3563
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:16,850
I can rise from being defeated once.

3564
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:20,750
Say you're sorry right now, Zen, and I'll get this weapon.

3565
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:26,330
I'm so sorry.

3566
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:29,010
Why is the... why is the screen shaking?

3567
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:29,810
Yeah.

3568
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:31,910
I dropped it.

3569
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:38,370
Don't want it.

3570
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:39,150
Don't want it.

3571
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:39,970
Oh, shit!

3572
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:43,170
I'm out.

3573
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:44,170
At peace.

3574
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:48,010
If he follows me up here, I'll fight him, but I'm not fighting him down there.

3575
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,690
Yeah, I'd love to.

3576
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:52,570
Oh my god, oh, he's here!

3577
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:53,030
Run!

3578
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:55,870
Why me?

3579
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,210
Are you fucking kidding me?

3580
01:47:58,590 --> 01:47:59,510
I'm faking my...

3581
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:01,710
Please, please get me out of here.

3582
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:03,750
Why me?

3583
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,570
Please, let me grab my weapon!

3584
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:14,470
Okay, I got my thing.

3585
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:15,170
I got my thing.

3586
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:15,810
I got my thing.

3587
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:16,430
I got my thing.

3588
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,690
I got my thing.

3589
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:18,650
I got my thing.

3590
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:20,930
God, I'm so sick with it.

3591
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:27,050
Oh my god, there's another one!

3592
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:29,050
There's another one coming!

3593
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:31,790
Okay.

3594
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:32,510
Oh!

3595
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:33,330
Get him.

3596
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:36,470
Goodbye!

3597
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:38,330
Thank you, Bandai.

3598
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:39,530
I really...

3599
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,510
We did back...

3600
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:43,550
We did not say thank you.

3601
01:48:43,570 --> 01:48:44,730
Did I just say goodbye?

3602
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:49,210
No, Bandai was like behind you, Doki, after I got slapped.

3603
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:51,830
Thank you, Bandai.

3604
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:52,350
I really...

3605
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,590
I really appreciate it.

3606
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:53,970
We appreciate it.

3607
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:54,450
Yeah.

3608
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:56,190
Get more devs like Bandai.

3609
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:59,010
Guys!

3610
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:00,490
Oh, what in the world?

3611
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:02,090
There's another one.

3612
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:03,890
There's so many.

3613
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:05,630
What the?

3614
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:09,190
Creasible Knight's here to make sure nobody has a good day.

3615
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:09,850
Yeah.

3616
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,170
I marked him.

3617
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:15,650
Got it.

3618
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:16,030
We...

3619
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:16,670
I need a grace.

3620
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:19,610
We need to find one before we get to the boss.

3621
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:20,370
Because I...

3622
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:21,590
I really need to level up.

3623
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:25,900
Nice.

3624
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,000
There we go, we got it.

3625
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,060
Improve incantation.

3626
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:35,240
What in the world just happened?

3627
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,640
All right.

3628
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:41,960
All right.

3629
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,220
Can you guys take me to a grace?

3630
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,320
I really need to level up.

3631
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,130
I'm sorry.

3632
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:51,910
I just realized you...

3633
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:53,110
Can you take me to a grace?

3634
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:56,430
Like, mom and dad, please, please, please take me there.

3635
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:56,690
I...

3636
01:49:57,230 --> 01:49:59,930
I need to level up, please, mom and dad.

3637
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:02,530
I fell down the fucking hole.

3638
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,270
How do I get out of the hole?

3639
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:04,830
Hey, guys.

3640
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:05,970
What the hell it is?

3641
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:08,170
Give me a sec.

3642
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:10,770
Dookie has lied all the way into the stream.

3643
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:11,150
I got it.

3644
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:11,570
I'm okay.

3645
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:12,110
I'm okay.

3646
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:12,690
I'm okay.

3647
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:16,150
I'm going to the...

3648
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:17,450
Mom, Dad, I'm leaving.

3649
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:18,950
Okay.

3650
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,290
We need a grace.

3651
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:22,690
There's one.

3652
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:24,710
Oh, there's a big...

3653
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:26,870
There's a big enemy and also there's one more Estes.

3654
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:27,990
Do you want more Estes?

3655
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:29,470
Oh my god, I'm level nine.

3656
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:30,230
Thank god.

3657
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:36,450
Okay, we gotta see if we can get one more fight, boss fight in before we go.

3658
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:38,430
I just went up three levels because of this.

3659
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:40,690
We want to go to the Estes.

3660
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:42,210
We could try and deliver the big guy on the way.

3661
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:42,930
Yeah.

3662
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:48,640
Here we go.

3663
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:55,060
I think it's your rewind.

3664
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:56,400
The rewind gives me a stutter.

3665
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,320
The rewind stutters, yeah.

3666
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,140
No, it's always me too.

3667
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:58,680
Okay.

3668
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:01,300
Jesus Christ.

3669
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:04,360
But the ones you were getting at the very start was not the photo of the rewind because I didn't have it.

3670
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:04,740
Yeah.

3671
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,960
Yeah, but the mini-studies was...

3672
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,520
I think it's like the crack...

3673
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:08,840
I don't know.

3674
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,540
Okay, we do not have time to fight the dudes.

3675
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:11,320
Yeah.

3676
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,200
My personal suggestion is we run...

3677
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:14,740
Oh god.

3678
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,660
We're gonna get fucked by this lava again.

3679
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,360
I feel it.

3680
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:18,580
No.

3681
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,640
I hope we can get like at least one boss in.

3682
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:22,200
Worse.

3683
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,880
Okay, we got to go around.

3684
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,300
We don't have time to go around.

3685
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,180
I don't think.

3686
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,120
The tree is so far.

3687
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,260
How do we get to the tree?

3688
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,540
Yeah, I think the thing is gonna collapse in on us.

3689
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:34,900
How do we get there?

3690
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:38,460
I'm gonna go with Lime.

3691
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:43,800
Lime, where are you going for it?

3692
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:45,620
A mistake has been made.

3693
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,380
Hey, Lime, how did you get there?

3694
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,940
Uh, I jumped down and then I used the...

3695
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:51,560
A little bit of a silly.

3696
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:52,980
...thing to go up.

3697
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:53,460
Okay.

3698
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,280
I'm scared now.

3699
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:58,360
I'm very scared.

3700
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,320
Oh, did you have to run past the boss for it?

3701
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,040
I see something I can use.

3702
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:05,600
Yeah.

3703
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:08,840
Okay.

3704
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,520
Oh, shit.

3705
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,760
Oh my god, please.

3706
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,320
Please don't.

3707
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:18,940
I have decided that this map modifier is very mean.

3708
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:19,900
That is the worst thing you could possibly use right now.

3709
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:20,540
Please.

3710
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:21,220
What in there?

3711
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:21,800
Please.

3712
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:23,500
I'm struggling.

3713
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:25,640
This is the worst run I've ever had.

3714
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,040
I'm so scared.

3715
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:30,980
Me too.

3716
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,420
Me too.

3717
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:33,640
Oh, shoot.

3718
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,400
Is it closing?

3719
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:38,680
Is it right behind me?

3720
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,660
It's right behind me, isn't it?

3721
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,640
I hit a wall!

3722
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,660
Are you fucking kidding me?

3723
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,360
All right, well, team, I made it.

3724
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,280
So we're good.

3725
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,000
Oh my god.

3726
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,020
Goodbye to your level.

3727
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

3728
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:56,420
I hit a wall.

3729
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,400
Oh my god.

3730
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:02,920
Hey, then.

3731
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:03,680
You made it.

3732
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,560
Oh my god.

3733
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:08,320
It's almost like I can still hear her.

3734
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,200
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

3735
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:10,940
She's almost here.

3736
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:11,720
She's almost here.

3737
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:12,960
I think she made it.

3738
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,260
Just don't fall down the little lip there.

3739
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:14,720
I'm almost there.

3740
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,540
This is my worst threat.

3741
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:17,480
Look at Zach.

3742
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,200
They're running along.

3743
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,040
Look at her go.

3744
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:20,260
I'm heading over.

3745
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:20,420
Don't worry.

3746
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,100
Ah, don't worry.

3747
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:24,220
Help me here.

3748
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,300
There goes my hero.

3749
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,940
I'm so proud of you.

3750
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:27,860
I'm here.

3751
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,320
I did it.

3752
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,300
I lost two flasks for this, but I'm here.

3753
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,820
I'm not here.

3754
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:33,940
I'm not here.

3755
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,380
I'm alive.

3756
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,380
It's go time.

3757
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,380
I'm alive.

3758
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:41,560
That's all that matters.

3759
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:48,420
Okay.

3760
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:56,490
Things are okay for Doki.

3761
01:53:57,770 --> 01:54:00,910
I didn't manage to get some good weapons, by the way.

3762
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:04,090
My weapons were honestly pretty ass.

3763
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:04,530
Well, it's actually weird.

3764
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:08,170
When you have multiple weapon passes, like you're supposed to have, things actually like die.

3765
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,290
Uh, there's something being rezzed.

3766
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:14,970
Who's doing the rezzing?

3767
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:15,650
I don't know.

3768
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:17,090
I'm just shooting.

3769
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:17,950
Yeah, because I got rezzed.

3770
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,450
What a dick.

3771
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:20,490
I just shoot.

3772
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:22,310
And that's all...

3773
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:23,090
Oh wait, what?

3774
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:25,130
Do we have to kill all of them at once?

3775
01:54:25,630 --> 01:54:26,390
I don't know.

3776
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:28,650
Or if it's just that there's a mob rezzing things.

3777
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:29,970
I haven't worked that out.

3778
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:31,390
I don't know either.

3779
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:31,910
I'm just...

3780
01:54:33,130 --> 01:54:34,250
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3781
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:36,010
Are they like skeletons where you have to hit them on the floor?

3782
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,350
Hold on.

3783
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:37,950
I don't know.

3784
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:38,270
Yeah, okay.

3785
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:38,850
Just hit them.

3786
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:39,750
Just hit them again once they're down.

3787
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:41,370
Hit them again once they're down.

3788
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:41,910
You gotta double tap.

3789
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:43,350
All right.

3790
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:44,850
What the fuck?

3791
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:45,550
You pushed me off!

3792
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:49,930
As an archer, I should not front that.

3793
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:51,630
No, I'm not okay.

3794
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:53,250
I'm not frontlining again.

3795
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:57,670
Oh, is this fucker?

3796
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:58,470
Okay, I...

3797
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:58,930
Yeah, rewind.

3798
01:54:59,150 --> 01:54:59,550
Do you have rewind?

3799
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,690
Yup.

3800
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:01,190
Okay.

3801
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:03,030
No, I don't like this guy.

3802
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:03,750
Rewind.

3803
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:11,530
Okay.

3804
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:14,290
Wait, he's easy.

3805
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:15,650
We got this.

3806
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:18,190
Why would you talk shit?

3807
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,350
Why would you talk shit?

3808
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:21,310
He's easy, guys.

3809
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:22,290
He's so easy.

3810
01:55:23,190 --> 01:55:23,670
Okay.

3811
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:24,990
Because I am the one.

3812
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:26,610
Okay.

3813
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:31,770
I need to recharge my stamina.

3814
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:37,440
Recharging stamina?

3815
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,700
This is the guy that picked me up.

3816
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:40,480
I remember him.

3817
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:41,920
Yeah.

3818
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,640
Oh, right.

3819
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:44,900
Whoa.

3820
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,440
Don't want that.

3821
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,710
Yeah, I can't mark him because he's like...

3822
01:55:50,130 --> 01:55:50,890
I'm in the shit.

3823
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:57,310
I can't get close to him for...

3824
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:00,790
For marking.

3825
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:04,830
Okay, never mind.

3826
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:05,490
He doesn't care.

3827
01:56:05,630 --> 01:56:06,810
He wants me to be closer to him.

3828
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:07,470
Okay, that's cool.

3829
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,930
Oh, that's sorry.

3830
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:12,370
I didn't mean that.

3831
01:56:12,730 --> 01:56:14,090
You do not have to get closer to me.

3832
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:17,310
I...

3833
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:18,010
No!

3834
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:19,250
Oh, you're welcome.

3835
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:19,850
Hey, Doki.

3836
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:20,990
Hey, Doki.

3837
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:22,450
Thanks for being our tank, Doki.

3838
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:22,950
No, please.

3839
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:26,010
No, I'm sorry.

3840
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:28,090
I don't want to be close.

3841
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:29,870
I'm not playing.

3842
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:31,930
You're using our natural taunt passive.

3843
01:56:32,270 --> 01:56:33,270
Thank you for the help.

3844
01:56:39,290 --> 01:56:40,270
I'm just...

3845
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:41,890
I'm just the archer!

3846
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:42,710
Please!

3847
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:44,210
Guys!

3848
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:46,810
I didn't know you could.

3849
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:48,650
Archer can be the tank.

3850
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:49,670
Jesus.

3851
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:51,030
All right.

3852
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:52,430
You're welcome, guys.

3853
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:53,390
You're welcome.

3854
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:55,610
It's really impressive if you think about it.

3855
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:57,590
You're welcome.

3856
01:56:58,610 --> 01:56:59,950
I'm here for you guys.

3857
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:00,970
He's looking at me.

3858
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:02,230
Guys, can you poke Zen?

3859
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:04,070
Where is she?

3860
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:05,070
Oh, there she is.

3861
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:07,190
Well, I hope he's aggroing.

3862
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:07,670
Is he?

3863
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:08,130
Ah!

3864
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:11,190
Do you have rewine?

3865
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:11,650
Because I have ult.

3866
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:13,350
But like, I need to make sure...

3867
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:13,850
I'm not close enough.

3868
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:14,430
Hold on.

3869
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:16,510
I need to make sure I live first.

3870
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:17,470
Okay.

3871
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:18,230
Is he...

3872
01:57:18,230 --> 01:57:19,530
He's still aggroed to me, by the way.

3873
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:20,690
He's still...

3874
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:21,070
He's still...

3875
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:23,090
I can't use my ult when he's aggroed.

3876
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:24,690
Okay, I can do it now.

3877
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:25,490
I'm ready.

3878
01:57:25,490 --> 01:57:25,510
I'm ready.

3879
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:27,830
I used it.

3880
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:29,230
I knocked him down.

3881
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:31,470
Please.

3882
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:33,390
Please.

3883
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:33,970
Please.

3884
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:38,890
He's still aggroed to me.

3885
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:42,890
Really?

3886
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:46,270
Is one of your weapons, things are more likely to attack you?

3887
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:46,950
I'm just wondering.

3888
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,090
I don't know.

3889
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:56,070
Oh, thank god.

3890
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:59,370
There's only room for one bird in this realm.

3891
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,270
And that's right!

3892
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:01,010
It's me!

3893
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:17,430
I'm using a stamina, I don't care.

3894
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:24,510
Rotate your ults.

3895
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:28,030
Use one when the boss goes into an invuln bubble.

3896
01:58:28,850 --> 01:58:30,230
Oh, is this for this boss?

3897
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:30,650
Okay.

3898
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:31,810
Oh.

3899
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:34,450
Okay, so you guys...

3900
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:36,810
One of you wants to have an ult when the boss is invulnerable.

3901
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:38,510
Okay, I see...

3902
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:40,070
Presumably it will break the bubble.

3903
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:42,070
So don't just spam your ult.

3904
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:43,430
I think it's what we're trying to do.

3905
01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:45,370
It'll be mine, because mine's an arrow, so...

3906
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:46,250
I think it'll be easier.

3907
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:49,790
Okay, I'm level 11 for this boss.

3908
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:50,930
So wait for the bubble to break.

3909
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:52,130
Got it.

3910
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:52,990
No, no, no.

3911
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:53,370
He's...

3912
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:55,790
They're saying, like, use your ult on the bubble to break it.

3913
01:58:59,170 --> 01:58:59,530
Okay.

3914
01:58:59,670 --> 01:58:59,810
I think.

3915
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:06,880
He also says, watch your feet.

3916
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:09,570
And my chat went, like, crazy once he said that, so...

3917
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:12,060
Nice.

3918
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:14,080
Why would that be?

3919
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,480
All right.

3920
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,950
I'm ready when you guys are.

3921
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:25,130
I am.

3922
01:59:29,010 --> 01:59:29,790
It's okay, Doki.

3923
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:31,950
As long as we've got you to do our tanking, we should be fine.

3924
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:32,990
I am.

3925
01:59:35,950 --> 01:59:36,590
I'm ready.

3926
01:59:36,690 --> 01:59:37,430
Doki's tired.

3927
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:39,010
I'm so tired.

3928
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:39,230
I'm so tired.

3929
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:39,250
Okay.

3930
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:46,250
I think it's whoever has her ult, still.

3931
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:47,330
Best tank ever.

3932
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:49,410
Because, like, depends on whoever gets their ult.

3933
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:55,090
Yeah, I think we just, we want to have an ult ready for when the bubble happens.

3934
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:01,740
I can't believe it, guys.

3935
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,480
Archers can become tanks, too.

3936
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:07,400
Unconsensually.

3937
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:09,020
I'm unconsensual tanking.

3938
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:11,020
Doki playing Season of Discovery tank hunter or something.

3939
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:25,420
Time for the next one.

3940
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:31,620
I'm scared.

3941
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:32,400
Me, too.

3942
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:33,780
I've never seen this guy before.

3943
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:35,640
Hey, we made it to the end, at least.

3944
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,940
With how abruptly things kill you in this game, I'm frightened of it.

3945
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:39,400
Yeah.

3946
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,360
It's like, see, new attack, dead.

3947
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:43,780
I swear.

3948
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,460
It has to be in the coding where, like, if you have an archer, target first.

3949
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,640
I swear to god, that has to be in the...

3950
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,560
There's no way.

3951
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:55,380
Literally, that bird never, like, looked at you guys.

3952
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:57,520
Well, that does not look menacing.

3953
02:00:59,200 --> 02:00:59,600
Hi.

3954
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,280
I'm scared.

3955
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:01,320
Hello.

3956
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:03,460
Team captain, go talk to him.

3957
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,740
Yeah, team captain, talk to him.

3958
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:05,420
What does he say?

3959
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:07,160
I'm gonna back up here.

3960
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:08,460
Me, too.

3961
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:10,440
Don't worry.

3962
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:13,020
They're like, aggro to me automatically, anyway.

3963
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,060
Okay, maybe we'll have to talk to him.

3964
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:17,480
Oh, we all have to make your choice?

3965
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:18,720
Make your choice?

3966
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:19,740
Oh god, no, what?

3967
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:23,780
I wish to have great strength.

3968
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,140
I wish for eventual greatness.

3969
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:26,720
I want to fight at utmost strength.

3970
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:27,960
I refuse to make a deal.

3971
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,200
Oh, wait.

3972
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:30,660
What?

3973
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:32,220
I'm scared.

3974
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:32,640
What?

3975
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,440
Is this, like, monkey paw situation?

3976
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:37,480
Is this a monkey paw situation?

3977
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:38,560
I refuse.

3978
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,600
I don't know.

3979
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,140
I swear to god.

3980
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:43,060
Govlin.

3981
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,080
We don't govlin deal.

3982
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:45,180
Begin.

3983
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:46,380
Refuse.

3984
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,060
I feel like this is monkey paw.

3985
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:48,620
I...

3986
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,600
It feels way too ominous.

3987
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:54,440
I don't know.

3988
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,000
You could say I refuse to make a deal.

3989
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:56,480
I don't want it.

3990
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:57,800
And then nothing happens.

3991
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:59,240
Yeah, no, I did refuse.

3992
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:00,540
I didn't refuse.

3993
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:02,180
I don't want that finger to curl.

3994
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:02,640
Whatever.

3995
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:04,240
I already went through so much.

3996
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:05,080
I...

3997
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:05,860
Oh, it tells me.

3998
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:06,220
It tells...

3999
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:06,580
Oh, shit.

4000
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:07,460
Bah.

4001
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,140
What monkey paw did you make?

4002
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:10,560
I went down to levels.

4003
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:10,960
I didn't.

4004
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:11,480
I was...

4005
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:12,560
I was...

4006
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,980
Zen, what monkey paw did you make, Zen?

4007
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:15,640
So...

4008
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,540
What monkey paw...

4009
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:19,940
Zen, what was your monkey paw?

4010
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:22,840
Ow.

4011
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:24,120
I could not get back in time.

4012
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:26,840
Oh, no.

4013
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:27,860
He's looking at me.

4014
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:28,660
Oh, it's the craziness.

4015
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:29,760
Oh, he's looking at me.

4016
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,140
I knew it.

4017
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:30,880
I knew it.

4018
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:32,620
I saw him.

4019
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,620
Oh, my God.

4020
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:39,940
I'm assuming if you do eventual greatness, what happens is you like...

4021
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:42,460
You are weak for a bit, and then you are strong.

4022
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:43,420
Okay.

4023
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:44,940
I knew it.

4024
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:44,960
Oh, my God.

4025
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,040
I could tell.

4026
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,900
Holy shit.

4027
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:50,400
No.

4028
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,180
Don't come near me.

4029
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:51,620
Please.

4030
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:52,200
Please.

4031
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:54,760
Please.

4032
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:56,320
I can't heal.

4033
02:02:56,980 --> 02:02:58,300
Keep doing your job.

4034
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,820
What does this golden stuff do, I wonder?

4035
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,240
You got this.

4036
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:04,260
I don't know.

4037
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:04,920
Oh, no.

4038
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:05,520
Hit him.

4039
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:05,760
Hit him.

4040
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,040
Hit him.

4041
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:06,440
Hit him.

4042
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:06,980
I don't have all.

4043
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:08,080
I don't have all.

4044
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:08,660
I don't have it.

4045
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:08,980
Oh, dear.

4046
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:09,920
Oh, dear.

4047
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:10,060
Oh, dear.

4048
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:13,020
It's whoever has all first, but none of us has all.

4049
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:15,700
Oh, this is bad.

4050
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:17,280
I have an ult that doesn't do anything.

4051
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:19,720
Oh, what does it do?

4052
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:21,160
I don't know.

4053
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:25,100
We seem okay.

4054
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:26,240
Smile.

4055
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:27,340
Well, that's worrisome.

4056
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:29,640
I'm saving my ult for this one, though.

4057
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,480
For the next one.

4058
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:31,860
He's looking at me.

4059
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:32,680
He's looking at me.

4060
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:34,360
He's looking at me.

4061
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:38,740
Do you know about madness in this game, Doki?

4062
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:39,660
No.

4063
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:40,780
Okay.

4064
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:41,780
If it maxes out, you die.

4065
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:42,420
Oh.

4066
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:45,640
No.

4067
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:46,640
Oh, my God.

4068
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:47,420
That almost maxed out.

4069
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,080
That almost maxed out.

4070
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:51,260
That was scary.

4071
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:51,840
Yeah, be careful.

4072
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:53,080
I have ult for the next one.

4073
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:55,820
I'm very frightened.

4074
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:58,320
This is like mythic blood shit.

4075
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:00,140
There's nowhere safe to stand.

4076
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:01,300
Oh, God.

4077
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:01,980
I have ult.

4078
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:03,220
I'm saving this for the next fight.

4079
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,200
I'm saving it for the next fight.

4080
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:05,420
Jesus.

4081
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,020
Oh, I might be...

4082
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,800
I might instant die for this one.

4083
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:09,880
Okay.

4084
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:11,240
That's fine.

4085
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,920
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

4086
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,040
Is that the bubble?

4087
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:18,660
Oh, I'm madness.

4088
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,300
I don't know.

4089
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:22,400
Guys.

4090
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:23,780
I'm not dead.

4091
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,620
Which is cool.

4092
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,180
Oh, we have to keep running.

4093
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:27,920
Hello.

4094
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:28,300
Holy.

4095
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:29,800
Yeah, I know.

4096
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:31,740
This one...

4097
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:32,600
This one's rough.

4098
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:34,960
This guy...

4099
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,280
This guy's rough.

4100
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:43,320
I can't even mark him because he's so aggressive.

4101
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,160
Oh, I have to collect the shinies?

4102
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:47,800
What do the shinies do?

4103
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:48,280
Oh, hit him, hit him.

4104
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:48,880
Bubble, bubble.

4105
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:49,300
Is he bubble?

4106
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:50,640
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4107
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:52,500
I still have my ult, though.

4108
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,560
Do you want me to save it?

4109
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,140
Uh, yes, probably.

4110
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:58,820
So, hey.

4111
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,360
He got really angry.

4112
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,400
He's a little pissed.

4113
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:04,000
Oh, this lower...

4114
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:04,960
The shinies lower madness.

4115
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:05,840
Shinies lower madness.

4116
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:07,240
Yes, they do.

4117
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:10,280
Okay, I marked him.

4118
02:05:12,820 --> 02:05:13,900
Jesus Christ!

4119
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,840
Goop, goop, goop.

4120
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,220
Okay, we're good.

4121
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:22,700
I have two flasks left.

4122
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,420
He does a lot of close-up attacks that are area of damage.

4123
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:31,060
I have one flasks left.

4124
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:34,060
Coming for Doki, but...

4125
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:34,880
Oh no, the circle!

4126
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:35,400
The circle!

4127
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:36,980
Oh, beans.

4128
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:38,740
He got me the mo...

4129
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:40,420
Oh, that's so unlucky.

4130
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:41,100
I don't got anything.

4131
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:42,200
He got me, literally.

4132
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:43,440
I had the ult, too.

4133
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,640
That's so unlucky.

4134
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:47,200
I'm trying to hit Doki, but Doki is on him.

4135
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:48,740
Ow.

4136
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:50,500
Yeah, that's so unlucky!

4137
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:53,580
Yeah, that's not good.

4138
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:54,900
I was the one with the ult, too.

4139
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:56,820
And he TPed to me, so I couldn't do anything.

4140
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,320
Uh, we need to hit Doki.

4141
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,820
It said hit the little circles when he has bubble form and you don't have ult.

4142
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,360
Gotta figure this out.

4143
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:03,960
Okay.

4144
02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:09,850
He's aggro to his end right now.

4145
02:06:10,990 --> 02:06:11,650
I got you.

4146
02:06:12,130 --> 02:06:12,870
Oh, never mind.

4147
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:16,350
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

4148
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:19,570
I'm not having...

4149
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:20,630
It's not going so well.

4150
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:21,270
It's not.

4151
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:22,510
That was my last rune, too.

4152
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:23,750
My last flas, too.

4153
02:06:25,730 --> 02:06:27,450
I'm like, oh my god.

4154
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:30,670
This boss is hard.

4155
02:06:31,670 --> 02:06:32,650
Yeah, yeah.

4156
02:06:36,450 --> 02:06:37,570
Of course it's me!

4157
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:39,970
I mean, it was okay for a little bit, and then it went very silly.

4158
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:42,570
I have to use my ult, because like, if he hits me, I'm dead.

4159
02:06:43,690 --> 02:06:44,690
Unless you want me to save it.

4160
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:50,550
Oh no.

4161
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,110
I'm dead to madness.

4162
02:06:54,230 --> 02:06:54,930
This one!

4163
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:57,030
Don't we just like, run backwards, maybe?

4164
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:01,130
You're the only one alive.

4165
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:03,190
You have to save him then, because she's one hit only.

4166
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:10,740
I have no more flask.

4167
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:14,340
I don't, I don't know if it's worth pressing me, but we can try.

4168
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:15,280
We can give it a try.

4169
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,740
He is using his special move.

4170
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:25,980
No, he's not.

4171
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:26,540
Don't worry about it.

4172
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:26,980
Don't look at it.

4173
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:27,640
Oh!

4174
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:28,580
Don't look at it!

4175
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,740
Oh my god!

4176
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:31,160
I'm trying to ult!

4177
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,360
I'm trying off this!

4178
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:35,500
I got the ult!

4179
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:35,940
I got the ult!

4180
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:36,300
You got it!

4181
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:36,660
Nice!

4182
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,220
Oh, you pissed him off, though.

4183
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:40,360
You pissed him off something fierce.

4184
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:40,860
Oh my god!

4185
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,600
Everything is as it should be.

4186
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:54,590
Just let me die.

4187
02:07:54,730 --> 02:07:55,630
I don't want to come back up.

4188
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,530
I don't even want to get back up.

4189
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:58,050
Yeah, you do, yeah, you do.

4190
02:07:58,050 --> 02:08:00,410
I don't want to, don't, don't bring me back up.

4191
02:08:00,630 --> 02:08:03,150
I don't, I don't want to, I don't want this anymore.

4192
02:08:03,410 --> 02:08:04,330
Be brave, dookie.

4193
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:06,310
I don't want to be part of this anymore.

4194
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:07,550
YouTube missed you, dookie.

4195
02:08:07,730 --> 02:08:08,310
No, I don't.

4196
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:10,650
YouTube missed you, dookie.

4197
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:12,790
We'll miss you if you go.

4198
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:15,550
Please, I don't want to go back.

4199
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:19,830
Don't bring me back!

4200
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:21,350
I told you that!

4201
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:23,530
I'm stuck in an animation!

4202
02:08:23,690 --> 02:08:24,070
Stop!

4203
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:27,290
I don't want to be back!

4204
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:28,810
I gotta go hit the thing.

4205
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:29,610
Hold on, Virvec.

4206
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:31,750
You have to hit the runes!

4207
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:32,670
You have to hit the runes!

4208
02:08:32,750 --> 02:08:33,190
Yeah, I am.

4209
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:33,710
I'm hitting them.

4210
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:37,330
Zed, hit the runes!

4211
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:38,370
Zed's dead!

4212
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:40,490
Oh no, Zed's dead?

4213
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:41,970
Okay, Zed, don't hit the runes.

4214
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:42,230
Whatever.

4215
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:49,470
Now that it's your turn.

4216
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:51,830
No, Zed, go to life!

4217
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:52,830
Leave me!

4218
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:53,970
I don't wanna...

4219
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:56,990
The moment I come back up, he's gonna come after me.

4220
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:58,930
Yeah, I only have one, Zed, so you can get me, maybe.

4221
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:02,050
Hero play, Zed!

4222
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:02,670
Hero play!

4223
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:03,890
I believe!

4224
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:04,630
Ooh!

4225
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:05,750
Hit in the back.

4226
02:09:09,670 --> 02:09:11,510
I'm crawling away from everyone.

4227
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:12,290
I believe in you.

4228
02:09:12,410 --> 02:09:14,710
I don't want to be a tank anymore.

4229
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:15,970
Oh, here we go.

4230
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:18,790
I don't want to be a tank anymore.

4231
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:19,350
No!

4232
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:21,630
That's right!

4233
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,070
I literally just got back up.

4234
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:25,250
It's not so fun, is it, guys?

4235
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:25,890
Oh hell.

4236
02:09:29,450 --> 02:09:32,430
It's not so fun be a tank, is it?

4237
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:42,530
I'm leaving very slowly.

4238
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:47,430
Oh my god.

4239
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:48,490
That area.

4240
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:49,570
Yeah, we can.

4241
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:50,350
He's out of here.

4242
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:51,230
He's out of here.

4243
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:52,430
He's out of here.

4244
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:55,910
Oh, Zen's so fucking...

4245
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:56,910
Oh, that's awkward.

4246
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:57,690
Goodbye!

4247
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:00,030
You know, we got halfway, though.

4248
02:10:00,270 --> 02:10:00,810
We got halfway.

4249
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:03,330
That's so awkward.

4250
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:08,250
Considering we had no idea what we were doing.

4251
02:10:08,490 --> 02:10:09,550
Yeah, that was true.

4252
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:10,490
Look at all.

4253
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:11,830
Look at how we walked around.

4254
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:14,090
If you press Y, you'll see your footprints.

4255
02:10:14,510 --> 02:10:15,530
Friends, I'm pressing my...

4256
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:18,030
Ah, other ability with the freaking claw.

4257
02:10:21,490 --> 02:10:22,150
That was...

4258
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:22,190
That was...

4259
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:25,210
You know, for our first time at that boss, I think we did pretty well.

4260
02:10:27,810 --> 02:10:29,950
50% on your...

4261
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:30,670
On your...

4262
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:30,790
Holy heck.

4263
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:33,450
Someone said phase two was even more fucked up, too.

4264
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,630
Oh, good.

4265
02:10:34,990 --> 02:10:35,330
God.

4266
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:41,370
I mean, we went to the end.

4267
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:43,710
So that means we don't have to wait too long, too, for the others.

4268
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:45,870
I think we might have been the last one.

4269
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:46,750
Oh, thank god.

4270
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:47,870
We don't have to wait at all.

4271
02:10:52,810 --> 02:10:53,710
That's good.

4272
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:55,470
That was fucked...

4273
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:56,470
That was like...

4274
02:10:56,470 --> 02:11:00,550
That second one was actually the most fucked up run we've ever had.

4275
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:01,290
For me.

4276
02:11:01,610 --> 02:11:03,070
That was some crazy freaking attacks.

4277
02:11:03,090 --> 02:11:03,610
That...

4278
02:11:03,610 --> 02:11:04,350
I have...

4279
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:04,550
Oh my god.

4280
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:09,130
I don't know why all the bosses then were so aggro to me.

4281
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:09,970
I don't know why.

4282
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:13,470
It was not fun.

4283
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:20,430
I can finally take a pee break.

4284
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:23,050
Yay!

4285
02:11:24,610 --> 02:11:25,190
Oh my god.

4286
02:11:27,690 --> 02:11:28,150
Yippee.

4287
02:11:30,150 --> 02:11:32,230
Oh no, I hope we aren't the only ones that wiped at him.

4288
02:11:33,370 --> 02:11:34,310
There's no way...

4289
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:36,370
There's no way the other teams...

4290
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:38,390
Were able to like...

4291
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,850
Oh my god.

4292
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:40,130
That guy was...

4293
02:11:40,130 --> 02:11:41,010
So bullshit.

4294
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:41,490
That...

4295
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:46,550
That guy...

4296
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:47,630
I think...

4297
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:48,350
I think it's fine.

4298
02:11:48,490 --> 02:11:50,010
The problem is when you like kind of...

4299
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,510
Start...

4300
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:53,530
Like...

4301
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:54,690
Cascade death.

4302
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:55,730
Yeah.

4303
02:11:56,050 --> 02:11:56,370
Oh yeah.

4304
02:11:56,570 --> 02:11:57,210
No, that's true.

4305
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:57,690
Yeah.

4306
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:03,220
Maybe.

4307
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:05,420
Apparently there's another one...

4308
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:05,720
Yes!

4309
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:06,960
It's not just us!

4310
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:08,220
Yes!

4311
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:09,480
One other team got wiped.

4312
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:10,220
Thank god.

4313
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:11,400
No.

4314
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:12,360
Thank god.

4315
02:12:12,540 --> 02:12:17,140
Also you guys have to remember, there's some teams that fought all the bosses for this thing already.

4316
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:18,160
But we didn't...

4317
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,360
We didn't have time...

4318
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:20,880
To do that.

4319
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:24,900
So some teams already know like all...

4320
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:27,560
That was their first time trying to...

4321
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:28,540
Um...

4322
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:29,620
Trying to fight that boss.

4323
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:30,060
So...

4324
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:31,780
Our first time seeing all the movesets.

4325
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:36,160
Maybe if the...

4326
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:38,020
Maybe if the...

4327
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:39,340
Tank didn't die...

4328
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,620
Oh, I'm sorry guys.

4329
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:42,120
The archer tank...

4330
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:43,580
Just had to die there.

4331
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:45,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4332
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:51,080
Sorry guys.

4333
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:53,360
Should have tanked more.

4334
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,160
Ha ha ha ha ha.

4335
02:13:10,170 --> 02:13:10,730
This...

4336
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:13,110
Game makes my computer run kind of warm.

4337
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:14,750
I mean it is...

4338
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:15,830
Like a really...

4339
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:16,570
Beefy game.

4340
02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:18,530
It is, yeah.

4341
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:18,910
Yeah.

4342
02:13:21,070 --> 02:13:21,630
Guys...

4343
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:22,690
Just so you guys know.

4344
02:13:22,810 --> 02:13:24,030
Do not upgrade your...

4345
02:13:24,030 --> 02:13:24,670
Drivers.

4346
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:25,250
For...

4347
02:13:25,250 --> 02:13:26,270
When this game comes out.

4348
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:28,250
Do not upgrade your drivers.

4349
02:13:28,530 --> 02:13:28,870
Ha ha ha.

4350
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:29,750
To the newest one.

4351
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:30,890
Keep your...

4352
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:31,710
Ha ha ha ha.

4353
02:13:32,330 --> 02:13:35,070
I downloaded the May 19th driver.

4354
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:37,930
Do not download that driver.

4355
02:13:38,570 --> 02:13:39,730
Ha ha ha ha.

4356
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:49,090
I'm having fun though.

4357
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:49,930
It's really fun.

4358
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:50,270
Holy heck.

4359
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:55,330
Hello.

4360
02:13:55,630 --> 02:13:55,890
Oh yeah.

4361
02:13:55,890 --> 02:13:57,310
Oh yeah, Zen you have to invite me again.

4362
02:13:57,490 --> 02:13:58,550
Because um...

4363
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:00,050
When I got kicked out of the session.

4364
02:14:00,050 --> 02:14:01,670
Because I DC'd that time.

4365
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:05,690
Did I not invite you?

4366
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:06,190
No, no.

4367
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:07,070
When I crashed.

4368
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:08,610
It kicked me out of the party.

4369
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:11,090
Alright.

4370
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:13,590
Okie doke.

4371
02:14:15,950 --> 02:14:16,630
Let me...

4372
02:14:16,630 --> 02:14:17,210
Get in.

4373
02:14:17,410 --> 02:14:17,970
Real quick.

4374
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:19,390
I have sent the invite.

4375
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:26,290
Yeah.

4376
02:14:26,650 --> 02:14:26,810
Alright.

4377
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:27,350
I'm in.

4378
02:14:29,710 --> 02:14:30,520
Do you know what...

4379
02:14:30,990 --> 02:14:31,350
Boss it is?

4380
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:32,090
For the next one?

4381
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:33,890
Our man.

4382
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:36,210
That's freaking last boss was crazy.

4383
02:14:36,790 --> 02:14:36,930
Yeah.

4384
02:14:37,330 --> 02:14:37,950
It was.

4385
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:39,790
But we're not the only ones that wiped.

4386
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:40,710
Yippee.

4387
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:42,670
Thank God.

4388
02:14:43,810 --> 02:14:44,410
Ha ha ha.

4389
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:44,890
Ha ha ha.

4390
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:46,710
Oh, it looks like...

4391
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:48,090
We hung around for quite a while.

4392
02:14:48,270 --> 02:14:48,790
Yeah, that's good.

4393
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:49,010
Yeah.

4394
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:52,950
That was a bad run for me though in general.

4395
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:54,310
Zen...

4396
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:55,230
Oh, that means his lime's turn.

4397
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:57,470
It was a little bit cursed because you got like kicked out.

4398
02:14:57,670 --> 02:14:57,770
Yeah.

4399
02:14:57,770 --> 02:14:58,830
And had to come back and everything.

4400
02:14:58,830 --> 02:14:59,370
And then I...

4401
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:02,670
I followed the false prophet into my death.

4402
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:04,170
Ha ha ha.

4403
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:06,910
Yeah, Zen...

4404
02:15:06,910 --> 02:15:09,190
Zen had a bad run on the first one.

4405
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:10,890
I have the bad run on the second one.

4406
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:11,830
So it's lime's turn.

4407
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:15,430
It's lime's turn to have a bad run.

4408
02:15:15,450 --> 02:15:16,170
I've never had a bad run in my life.

4409
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:16,690
Alright.

4410
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:18,390
We're gonna have a bad run on this one.

4411
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:19,410
Each of us gets one.

4412
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:21,310
Ha ha ha ha.

4413
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:31,460
Wait, can I actually kill these birds?

4414
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:32,940
Oh, I...

4415
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:34,060
I can hit them.

4416
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:36,300
Or...

4417
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:37,540
A good ho job though.

4418
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:38,740
Good job.

4419
02:15:38,980 --> 02:15:39,360
Yeah.

4420
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:40,880
I'm having fun.

4421
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:43,560
Yeah, that guy's cool.

4422
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:44,480
The one that turns into a dog.

4423
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,500
I don't like his...

4424
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,080
Uh...

4425
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:47,120
Character ability though.

4426
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:48,720
It's like, um...

4427
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:49,840
Deflection based.

4428
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:50,940
And I didn't really want to like...

4429
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:51,880
Experiment with learning it.

4430
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:52,700
In the time that we had.

4431
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:53,300
So I don't...

4432
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:54,020
Oh yeah, yeah.

4433
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:54,640
The...

4434
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,220
The guy...

4435
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:55,400
Yeah.

4436
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:56,420
That guy seems cool.

4437
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,800
He uses a cursed sword.

4438
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:00,680
He seems like he does a lot of damage too.

4439
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:01,900
Mm-mm.

4440
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:02,900
In general.

4441
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:17,870
Man, this game is a lot of fun.

4442
02:16:18,230 --> 02:16:18,410
Yeah.

4443
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:20,530
You just pretend it's Sekiro?

4444
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:20,930
That's cool.

4445
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:27,740
It is freaking intense, that is for sure.

4446
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:28,760
Mm-hmm.

4447
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,640
Guys, why would I ever...

4448
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:34,180
I'm waiting...

4449
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:36,140
I'm waiting for like, Nameless King to show up or some shit.

4450
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:37,680
And like, trigger my PTSD.

4451
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:41,420
Oh yes, and you know what?

4452
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:42,360
This is our third boss.

4453
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:42,380
Wait.

4454
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:43,880
Did you guys refuse the offer?

4455
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:45,220
Of what?

4456
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:45,920
I didn't...

4457
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,620
I didn't like, know what I was doing.

4458
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:49,140
So...

4459
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:50,360
And I didn't realize there was a timer on it.

4460
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:51,160
So I didn't get one.

4461
02:16:52,140 --> 02:16:52,760
Oh, for what?

4462
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,620
Possibly would've helped.

4463
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:56,420
Doki refused, and I think you're not supposed to.

4464
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:59,000
I think like, you know, if you do, you make the fight harder for yourself.

4465
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:00,080
Oh!

4466
02:17:01,220 --> 02:17:03,540
I asked if it was a monkey paw situation.

4467
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:06,020
And even Bandai was like, mm, maybe.

4468
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:07,940
And I was like, okay, I'm not taking that.

4469
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,600
He's like, mm, maybe.

4470
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:14,500
Look at this guy like two-shotting bosses with his setup.

4471
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,280
He chose the weapon and lost two levels.

4472
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:17,640
Oh, nice.

4473
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:22,140
Oops.

4474
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:23,140
My greed.

4475
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:25,900
Refusing doesn't make it harder?

4476
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:26,420
Oh, thank you.

4477
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:27,660
Oh, okay.

4478
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:28,500
It doesn't make it harder.

4479
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:28,880
There's some...

4480
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:31,360
There's some very interesting stuff going on with spells.

4481
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:32,900
Look at the fucking damage they do.

4482
02:17:33,380 --> 02:17:35,100
Oh, is one of them a sorcerer?

4483
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:36,940
Wait, are they still fighting the bosses?

4484
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:38,900
No, it's the highlights.

4485
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:39,900
Oh, it's the highlights.

4486
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:40,300
Oh.

4487
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:40,860
Yeah.

4488
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:42,300
We had a spellcaster, maybe.

4489
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:44,580
I heard spellcasters, like, really difficult.

4490
02:17:47,970 --> 02:17:49,770
Because they're also, like, very squishy, too.

4491
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:52,290
We know they're the speedrunners, chat.

4492
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:53,390
Yeah.

4493
02:17:54,410 --> 02:17:55,470
Oh, yeah, that's why.

4494
02:17:55,830 --> 02:17:56,070
Yeah.

4495
02:17:57,230 --> 02:17:58,530
They min-maxed that shit.

4496
02:17:59,810 --> 02:18:01,630
I just wanna shoot my bow.

4497
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:10,210
Oh, I guess, like...

4498
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:11,450
I mean, I guess, like...

4499
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:12,750
Team 10 doesn't get a highlight.

4500
02:18:12,970 --> 02:18:13,170
Sorry.

4501
02:18:15,730 --> 02:18:16,170
What...

4502
02:18:16,170 --> 02:18:17,190
What's our highlight?

4503
02:18:17,970 --> 02:18:18,630
I don't know.

4504
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:19,350
We haven't had one yet.

4505
02:18:20,190 --> 02:18:20,510
No!

4506
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:24,190
It's okay.

4507
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:26,310
I'm just happy about our first run.

4508
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:28,870
That's what...

4509
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:30,290
I peaked in my first run.

4510
02:18:30,470 --> 02:18:31,390
You know how people peak in high school?

4511
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:33,290
I'm looking forward to getting...

4512
02:18:33,290 --> 02:18:33,330
I'm looking forward to getting...

4513
02:18:33,330 --> 02:18:35,210
Watching Doki getting chased down...

4514
02:18:35,210 --> 02:18:35,690
And then...

4515
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:37,190
Yeah.

4516
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:37,970
Yeah, I'm looking...

4517
02:18:37,970 --> 02:18:40,150
I'm looking forward to seeing, like, what this game...

4518
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:40,990
Five bosses in a row!

4519
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:41,490
...getting better at it.

4520
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:46,370
Yeah, that's...

4521
02:18:46,370 --> 02:18:47,350
That was my highlight.

4522
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:49,170
Fucking running around...

4523
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:50,550
Trying to make sure I don't die.

4524
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:54,870
The crazy thing is, like, when I stopped...

4525
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:55,810
When I had to run around...

4526
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:56,690
Stopped doing damage...

4527
02:18:56,690 --> 02:18:57,870
He was still chasing me...

4528
02:18:57,870 --> 02:18:59,490
While you guys were brawling him in the back.

4529
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:01,230
That was the fucking crazy shit.

4530
02:19:01,370 --> 02:19:03,230
I was like, how am I still aggro to him?

4531
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:15,280
But yeah, it's gonna be really fun...

4532
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,360
To learn and get better at this game.

4533
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:17,340
So you were supposed to be level 15, I guess.

4534
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:20,100
We were supposed to be level 15?!

4535
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:21,760
What level were you, Doki?

4536
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:23,440
I was level 11!

4537
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,140
They said level 12 was low.

4538
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,160
I don't really know how to kill things...

4539
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,260
Like, fast enough, then.

4540
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:40,160
You mean I was not supposed to be level 11?

4541
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,600
Who would've thought?

4542
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,380
It doesn't help that I took a weapon...

4543
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:46,200
That dropped me all the way down to 9.

4544
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:53,760
I don't think we need...

4545
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:55,520
I think we have 6 flasks more than enough.

4546
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,200
I think we aim for 6 and...

4547
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:57,980
Or 6 or 5.

4548
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:59,160
And then we can...

4549
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:00,760
Find stuff.

4550
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:02,680
Oh, they're short enough now.

4551
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:02,960
So enemies give more?

4552
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:04,740
Yeah, we just don't know what those enemies are yet.

4553
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:05,900
Yeah, we don't know the routes.

4554
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:10,020
And also, it's like super RNG.

4555
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,080
So it's like...

4556
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:12,920
I guess it's like the bosses are harder.

4557
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:15,120
You know, when they're marked as like really hard bosses.

4558
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:20,840
But like, we have to just do really well against them.

4559
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:23,780
There's no way you guys use me dying as a highlight.

4560
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:26,780
The entire reel has been you getting hit by stuff.

4561
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:27,720
It's kinda harsh.

4562
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:28,120
Zen?

4563
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:29,760
Zen being hit by stuff?

4564
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:33,100
There's no way you'll put me 3 times.

4565
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:41,580
I mean, we were under level and we still got 50%.

4566
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:43,320
We're actually doing some really sick moves as well.

4567
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:45,000
That's actually fucked up.

4568
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:48,320
Like, Emily's just mostly Zen getting hit.

4569
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:48,860
That's fucked.

4570
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:50,280
What in the world?

4571
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:57,040
Oh, you should probably ready up.

4572
02:20:57,140 --> 02:20:57,420
Hold on.

4573
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:58,660
I need to...

4574
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:04,390
I should have gave you one of the freaking captains.

4575
02:21:06,290 --> 02:21:08,530
Bro, your highlights were only of deaths?

4576
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:09,310
Wait, really?

4577
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:12,830
I was like, Bye, Zen.

4578
02:21:13,030 --> 02:21:14,090
Thanks for hitting us.

4579
02:21:14,130 --> 02:21:16,490
We didn't get highlights the first round.

4580
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:18,770
And the second round was just Zen getting hit.

4581
02:21:19,210 --> 02:21:19,590
What?

4582
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:23,410
Bro, our first round was so fucking sick!

4583
02:21:27,210 --> 02:21:28,010
I know.

4584
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:29,630
My ult res!

4585
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:30,670
Come on!

4586
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:39,880
I'm literally flying across the freaking room like Spider-Man and...

4587
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,360
No.

4588
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,000
Let's not highlight that.

4589
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:46,120
Let's get Zen when they're down.

4590
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,140
Guys, make a clip of our...

4591
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:48,680
My...

4592
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:49,900
Of my cool moments.

4593
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,640
And then we'll get more views.

4594
02:21:59,650 --> 02:22:00,550
Guys, please.

4595
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:03,410
I need to redeem myself.

4596
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:04,630
I need someone...

4597
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:05,670
To redeem me.

4598
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:07,070
My...

4599
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:08,290
My trickshot...

4600
02:22:08,290 --> 02:22:09,530
Iron Eyes compilation.

4601
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:12,390
Oh my god.

4602
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:13,730
Because no one has this game yet.

4603
02:22:13,770 --> 02:22:15,690
I'll be like the only Iron Eyes montage.

4604
02:22:17,790 --> 02:22:21,850
Guys, make me an Iron Eyes montage before the game releases to everyone.

4605
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:25,910
So I'll be the only one.

4606
02:22:26,330 --> 02:22:27,650
The only one.

4607
02:22:32,130 --> 02:22:33,410
The first montage.

4608
02:22:35,010 --> 02:22:37,630
The password is showing who's going to join.

4609
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:40,070
Huh?

4610
02:22:41,930 --> 02:22:42,310
Literally.

4611
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:43,570
Who's gonna join?

4612
02:22:47,550 --> 02:22:48,530
Yeah, they can't join.

4613
02:22:48,610 --> 02:22:49,010
Yeah, I know.

4614
02:22:49,150 --> 02:22:49,650
Like who...

4615
02:22:49,650 --> 02:22:51,070
Yeah, no one else has this.

4616
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:51,630
No one else has this.

4617
02:22:51,730 --> 02:22:52,670
Yeah, that's true.

4618
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:53,750
I was gonna be like...

4619
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:54,350
Who can join?

4620
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:56,870
No one else has the game except for the streamers.

4621
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:06,940
Alright.

4622
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:07,980
It's time.

4623
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:10,000
Alright.

4624
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:10,420
I'm ready.

4625
02:23:30,710 --> 02:23:31,390
Oh boy.

4626
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:32,490
Here we go.

4627
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:32,990
Woo!

4628
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:34,390
Who are we fighting?

4629
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:35,530
What's the boss?

4630
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:38,070
Oh, Fisher and the...

4631
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:38,870
Oh, it's a dragon.

4632
02:23:39,150 --> 02:23:40,070
Oh, good luck everyone.

4633
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:41,230
I have no idea.

4634
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:42,010
It's a...

4635
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:43,270
The icon's a dragon.

4636
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:49,910
I wish we have the influencer build.

4637
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:51,190
The streamer build.

4638
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:52,630
And we leave messages around.

4639
02:23:52,850 --> 02:23:54,870
And then people can just kill me.

4640
02:23:58,550 --> 02:23:59,190
Totally.

4641
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:07,730
Alright.

4642
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:09,330
This time we got this.

4643
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,110
I believe.

4644
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:15,530
It's Lime's turn to suffer.

4645
02:24:17,630 --> 02:24:18,370
It's your turn.

4646
02:24:18,410 --> 02:24:18,510
Oh boy.

4647
02:24:18,830 --> 02:24:20,250
We're actually doing really good.

4648
02:24:20,390 --> 02:24:21,010
To be fair.

4649
02:24:21,150 --> 02:24:21,790
Yeah, make it to like...

4650
02:24:21,790 --> 02:24:24,690
Maybe we don't have a rough start two times in a row.

4651
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:27,390
This is gonna be right where we start.

4652
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:28,230
Did you see the hands?

4653
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,890
So we should grab that and then move.

4654
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:31,470
Yeah, I see hands.

4655
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:31,890
Cool.

4656
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:33,450
Do you see the hands below us?

4657
02:24:34,350 --> 02:24:35,870
Oh, we're basically dropping on the church.

4658
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:37,070
We should grab that and then...

4659
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:37,590
Alright.

4660
02:24:37,790 --> 02:24:37,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4661
02:24:37,870 --> 02:24:39,150
I'm gonna catch these hands.

4662
02:24:42,190 --> 02:24:42,550
Alright.

4663
02:24:42,730 --> 02:24:43,230
We just...

4664
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:43,810
We need to...

4665
02:24:43,810 --> 02:24:43,930
Ow.

4666
02:24:45,670 --> 02:24:46,030
Rats.

4667
02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:49,110
I can get killed by a rat.

4668
02:24:49,570 --> 02:24:50,110
I got it.

4669
02:24:50,230 --> 02:24:50,950
Alright, where do we go next?

4670
02:24:50,950 --> 02:24:51,650
Freaking rats.

4671
02:24:55,990 --> 02:24:58,430
Yeah, I just don't know how we actually like...

4672
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,530
Well, I feel like...

4673
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:01,210
Up top there, there were those hands.

4674
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:02,790
But I don't know if we can kill them yet.

4675
02:25:04,050 --> 02:25:05,570
Yeah, I don't know if they're worth much either.

4676
02:25:08,210 --> 02:25:09,750
Oh my god, my five's damaged.

4677
02:25:09,990 --> 02:25:10,350
Let's go.

4678
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:11,930
I need to get closer to them.

4679
02:25:12,670 --> 02:25:14,650
We can check it out really quick.

4680
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:16,570
Oh!

4681
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:17,690
We have enough for one level.

4682
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:23,220
Rats.

4683
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:23,880
Rats.

4684
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:26,860
I'm going up.

4685
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:27,260
Yeah.

4686
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:28,000
Okay.

4687
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:29,200
Alright.

4688
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:30,480
Oh my god, please.

4689
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:32,840
Ho ho ho!

4690
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:33,740
There he is!

4691
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:34,920
I hate the big hands.

4692
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:36,260
There's two of them!

4693
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:37,740
Oh ho ho!

4694
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:39,080
He's looking at me, guys!

4695
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:41,700
Guys, that is so fucking huge.

4696
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:42,640
Oh my god!

4697
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:43,400
And it's...

4698
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:47,000
Uh...

4699
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:47,860
Business as usual.

4700
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:48,880
Please.

4701
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:49,640
Please.

4702
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:52,540
You don't think you're gonna catch these hands.

4703
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:53,640
Please, get up!

4704
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:55,780
Is it trying to like, follow you off the fucking cliff?

4705
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:56,980
I don't know.

4706
02:25:59,320 --> 02:25:59,840
Please.

4707
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:02,360
Oh my god!

4708
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:03,140
The other hand's here!

4709
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:03,600
The...

4710
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:04,600
One of the other hands are here!

4711
02:26:08,220 --> 02:26:09,360
I'm trying to like...

4712
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,620
Hitbox, I have a bone to pick with you.

4713
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:13,140
Okay.

4714
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,460
I marked him.

4715
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:15,120
I marked the hand.

4716
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:18,340
I'm...

4717
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:19,460
I can't see anything.

4718
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:20,140
I...

4719
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:21,220
I can't see anything.

4720
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,200
Oh my god.

4721
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:23,060
It's just hands.

4722
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:24,240
Oh my god.

4723
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:24,940
There's hands everywhere.

4724
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,060
There's hands everywhere!

4725
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:27,740
It's just hands.

4726
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:33,240
JK.

4727
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:34,620
It's just hands.

4728
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:36,760
Oh my god!

4729
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:37,440
Oh my...

4730
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:37,840
I got...

4731
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:38,140
I know.

4732
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:40,420
I know about giving somebody a hand.

4733
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:41,720
But this is ridiculous.

4734
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:43,040
I'm...

4735
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:44,220
I got stuck there.

4736
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:49,600
I unfortunately got stuck.

4737
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:51,280
I can't.

4738
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:51,540
Thank you.

4739
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:52,720
Got one.

4740
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:53,660
Thank you.

4741
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:54,820
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

4742
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:56,160
I'm just going to fall off here.

4743
02:26:56,600 --> 02:26:56,920
Okay.

4744
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:58,180
I need to...

4745
02:26:58,180 --> 02:26:58,780
Oh wait.

4746
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:00,000
No, Zen!

4747
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:00,940
Oh no, Zen!

4748
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:03,100
Wait, where are you?

4749
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:03,720
That's awkward.

4750
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:05,000
She...

4751
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:05,580
She died.

4752
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:09,260
I just heard I'm gonna fall off here and then she disappeared.

4753
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:12,860
I don't know.

4754
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:13,480
Do you want to move on?

4755
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:15,080
We can try and kill one more hand.

4756
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:15,680
They're all low.

4757
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:18,140
I lost the only level I had.

4758
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:18,740
Ow.

4759
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:19,340
So sad.

4760
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:20,340
There's two that's low.

4761
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:21,160
That's why I want...

4762
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:22,640
I don't feel like if we just kill one more.

4763
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:23,700
Alright.

4764
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:26,220
Which ones are low?

4765
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:27,380
Oh my god.

4766
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,740
I'm being thrown around by a hand.

4767
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:29,700
I don't know.

4768
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:31,100
I'm...

4769
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:32,080
There's another giant one.

4770
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,040
I burned him.

4771
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:36,860
Oh god.

4772
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:37,940
Oh my god.

4773
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:38,700
I got binded.

4774
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:39,880
I got binded.

4775
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:41,680
I can't help you.

4776
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:42,920
He's low.

4777
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:43,360
Is he low?

4778
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:44,060
Is he low?

4779
02:27:44,060 --> 02:27:44,680
Oh, I...

4780
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:45,700
Did fire on him?

4781
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,380
Okay, we should go.

4782
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:50,900
I don't think this is worth it.

4783
02:27:52,420 --> 02:27:53,380
The first one gave a lot.

4784
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:55,000
I mean, we could do this one.

4785
02:27:55,220 --> 02:27:56,020
This big hand.

4786
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:56,460
Right here.

4787
02:27:56,740 --> 02:27:57,420
I left.

4788
02:27:57,860 --> 02:27:58,180
Oh.

4789
02:27:58,180 --> 02:27:59,000
He said we should go.

4790
02:27:59,240 --> 02:27:59,720
I'm sorry.

4791
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:00,500
That's fine.

4792
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:01,060
We can go now.

4793
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:02,180
I feel like we should just kill a boss.

4794
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:03,580
I don't think it's worth that much.

4795
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:05,180
Uh...

4796
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:05,580
We got to...

4797
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:06,320
I got to level four.

4798
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:06,820
I think.

4799
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:08,540
Alright.

4800
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:09,460
Oops.

4801
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:10,100
All hands.

4802
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:13,240
I got a level four too.

4803
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:13,920
There's a little...

4804
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:14,700
Little building there.

4805
02:28:15,300 --> 02:28:15,640
Yeah.

4806
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:16,180
We should get there.

4807
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:16,740
We should get that.

4808
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:18,200
Nice.

4809
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:24,250
Yeah, let's see if we can get this little building here.

4810
02:28:25,170 --> 02:28:25,870
Alright, I'm heading over.

4811
02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:27,270
Good idea.

4812
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:32,190
Yeah, it feels like there's probably a route you should go.

4813
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:33,570
To get like...

4814
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:34,430
Oh my fuck.

4815
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:35,110
Is that boss?

4816
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:36,030
To get as much, uh...

4817
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:38,790
What's that?

4818
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:40,030
Is that something attacking us?

4819
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:42,510
Oh, I guess instead of jars is magic now?

4820
02:28:48,340 --> 02:28:48,780
Oh.

4821
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:51,080
There's Alexander jars in here.

4822
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:54,060
I'm like a little behind you guys, so...

4823
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:55,260
Oh, are we in the zone?

4824
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:56,720
I love them so much.

4825
02:28:56,780 --> 02:28:57,480
No, definitely not.

4826
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:02,880
We didn't kill any bosses, so this is a little awkward though for us.

4827
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:05,680
Jesus.

4828
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:08,160
Oh.

4829
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,100
Going up.

4830
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:11,240
That's 2,000 points.

4831
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:11,780
We...

4832
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:13,080
We wanna get out, I think.

4833
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:14,780
Okay, I'll come over.

4834
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:15,500
I'll follow you.

4835
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,480
I mean, we can go up, but...

4836
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:20,440
We're gonna be left in the...

4837
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:21,580
Out of the ring, I think.

4838
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:24,100
There's nothing you hear that's not good.

4839
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:26,620
I just wanna find some...

4840
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:28,300
Some bosses, because we haven't...

4841
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:28,640
Let's go find some more stuff.

4842
02:29:29,140 --> 02:29:30,880
Because we haven't done a single boss yet.

4843
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:35,180
Yeah, but I'm pretty high up on levels, because those hands were worth a lot.

4844
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:35,940
That's true.

4845
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:36,900
Oh, there's a boss here.

4846
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:37,660
Wait.

4847
02:29:37,980 --> 02:29:38,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4848
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,400
Wait for Sen.

4849
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:39,980
Wait for Sen.

4850
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:42,080
I want to kill them anyway.

4851
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:42,720
I mean, we can start.

4852
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:44,400
Okay.

4853
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:46,640
I used my ult accidentally.

4854
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:48,660
Oh, that's a...

4855
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:49,120
Wait, hold on.

4856
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:50,000
Blackblade Kindred?

4857
02:29:50,340 --> 02:29:50,700
Hmm.

4858
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,400
This might be a bad idea.

4859
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:53,040
Let's not...

4860
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,000
Yeah, let's do him for now.

4861
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:54,380
Okay.

4862
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:57,780
We know he's there, but I think that's a fucking bad idea.

4863
02:29:58,660 --> 02:30:00,340
Alright, we can do that when we level up more.

4864
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:01,620
But we still need...

4865
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:03,000
Yeah, that's the big guy.

4866
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:04,880
He's marked already, so we should be good.

4867
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:05,660
We'll do him day two.

4868
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:06,700
We'll go over here.

4869
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:11,630
Alright.

4870
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:13,750
If you guys see a grace, let me know.

4871
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:15,370
I feel like we can get another level up in.

4872
02:30:19,830 --> 02:30:20,690
Looking for stuff.

4873
02:30:20,990 --> 02:30:21,610
Looking for stuff.

4874
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:22,190
Oh!

4875
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,390
Alright.

4876
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:27,370
I can't wait for the easiest boss in this area.

4877
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:27,910
Oh, we're on face.

4878
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:34,080
Nope, that's not a thing.

4879
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:35,840
Gonna kill this guy.

4880
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:38,040
Mark and press.

4881
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:39,700
Marked.

4882
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:40,840
Dead.

4883
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:44,980
Okay, what else is here?

4884
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,520
Hello, hello.

4885
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:48,640
Oh, there's the boss.

4886
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:49,100
There's the boss.

4887
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:50,300
Oh my fuck.

4888
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,440
Oh, that's a big guy.

4889
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:53,440
He's so huge.

4890
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:54,940
Whoa, there he is.

4891
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:55,880
Oh, Zen.

4892
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:58,520
There she goes.

4893
02:30:59,380 --> 02:31:00,140
I got you Zen.

4894
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:01,360
I got you.

4895
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:01,620
I got you.

4896
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:01,920
I got you.

4897
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,160
I'm just trying to kill the other worm guy for us.

4898
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:04,720
Is that paralysis?

4899
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:05,920
I don't remember what that one is.

4900
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:06,740
Jesus.

4901
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:08,800
Damn.

4902
02:31:09,220 --> 02:31:10,020
Oh my god.

4903
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:11,820
Trying to head over to you.

4904
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:13,800
He's marked now.

4905
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,580
He should be low.

4906
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:17,060
Nice.

4907
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,420
Okay, we should have a helpline.

4908
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:25,060
I can mark him.

4909
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:28,280
I marked him?

4910
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:30,920
Nice.

4911
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:34,060
He's so low.

4912
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:35,300
Nice.

4913
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:38,880
We should kill this guy too.

4914
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:39,000
Yep.

4915
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:43,360
Other guy right here.

4916
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:44,280
Yeah.

4917
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:45,860
Let's see.

4918
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:48,080
Ironbow.

4919
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:52,160
I'm gonna grab the weapon.

4920
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:53,960
Weapon seems better.

4921
02:31:59,650 --> 02:32:00,330
Alright.

4922
02:32:01,210 --> 02:32:02,170
S is here?

4923
02:32:02,830 --> 02:32:03,670
Alright, let's go.

4924
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:04,010
Oh.

4925
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:05,550
Level six, almost.

4926
02:32:09,610 --> 02:32:10,050
Nice.

4927
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:18,400
Oh.

4928
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:25,310
My chat was like, oh, you know, magic arrows.

4929
02:32:25,450 --> 02:32:27,830
And then right underneath it was like, nice, magic damage.

4930
02:32:30,610 --> 02:32:32,170
The tale of two chats.

4931
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:33,450
Okay.

4932
02:32:35,050 --> 02:32:36,210
Uh, there's a cave here.

4933
02:32:36,210 --> 02:32:37,910
Do you wanna try and mess with that?

4934
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:39,190
And then go to the castle next?

4935
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:39,470
I feel like...

4936
02:32:39,470 --> 02:32:40,490
But will there be bosses in a cave?

4937
02:32:41,370 --> 02:32:42,230
I think so.

4938
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:44,470
It seems weird that there wouldn't be something in there.

4939
02:32:44,870 --> 02:32:45,090
You know?

4940
02:32:47,330 --> 02:32:48,910
Alternatively, there's a settlement right there.

4941
02:32:49,570 --> 02:32:49,990
It's up to you.

4942
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:51,350
Uh...

4943
02:32:51,350 --> 02:32:51,950
I don't know.

4944
02:32:52,430 --> 02:32:53,150
I'm not...

4945
02:32:53,150 --> 02:32:53,930
I don't know, actually.

4946
02:32:54,490 --> 02:32:55,610
I'm just a follower.

4947
02:32:55,990 --> 02:32:56,830
Wait, how do we get back up?

4948
02:32:57,110 --> 02:32:57,490
Let's do it.

4949
02:32:57,810 --> 02:32:59,250
The cave is at the bottom, I think.

4950
02:32:59,450 --> 02:33:00,150
How do we get back up?

4951
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:01,730
Oh.

4952
02:33:05,550 --> 02:33:05,950
Alright.

4953
02:33:07,430 --> 02:33:08,550
He's like, I don't know.

4954
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:10,930
YOLO.

4955
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:22,260
Surely there's something of worth in here, right?

4956
02:33:22,260 --> 02:33:23,340
These guys are easy.

4957
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:26,700
I'm just gonna...

4958
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:28,240
I'm gonna scout, see if I can find something.

4959
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:31,120
Okay.

4960
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:34,440
Uh...

4961
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:36,160
A dude here, but not a big dude.

4962
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:38,700
I'm getting the little dudes.

4963
02:33:43,930 --> 02:33:46,970
Yeah, there's no point really, like, going after the miners, I think, without blunt damage.

4964
02:33:46,970 --> 02:33:49,310
Because they are very resistant, if it's anything like the base game.

4965
02:33:49,990 --> 02:33:51,270
Oh, I killed him pretty fast.

4966
02:33:52,690 --> 02:33:54,070
Alright, then you go for it, girl.

4967
02:33:54,070 --> 02:33:54,430
Yeah.

4968
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:57,050
Uh, there was nothing this way, I just went all the way through.

4969
02:33:57,670 --> 02:33:57,810
Alright, cool.

4970
02:33:57,810 --> 02:33:59,030
I'm just gonna go out, get out, then.

4971
02:33:59,210 --> 02:33:59,750
Of the mine.

4972
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:01,470
Weird.

4973
02:34:01,790 --> 02:34:03,010
Maybe it was in the other direction.

4974
02:34:03,650 --> 02:34:04,270
Okie doke.

4975
02:34:04,830 --> 02:34:05,330
Yeah, I don't think...

4976
02:34:05,330 --> 02:34:06,250
Maybe it's just a shortcut.

4977
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:07,450
Oh my god.

4978
02:34:08,010 --> 02:34:08,370
Alright.

4979
02:34:09,470 --> 02:34:11,970
Uh, I'm gonna mess with this settlement, I guess.

4980
02:34:15,010 --> 02:34:16,370
I'm heading them over.

4981
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:18,830
Where do we get out?

4982
02:34:21,150 --> 02:34:21,930
Oh, here?

4983
02:34:22,670 --> 02:34:23,850
Oh, here I found it.

4984
02:34:26,930 --> 02:34:28,990
Should be a thing around here somewhere.

4985
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:33,190
Alright.

4986
02:34:33,650 --> 02:34:34,770
Oh, I found some dudes.

4987
02:34:35,250 --> 02:34:35,770
I'm heading to...

4988
02:34:36,110 --> 02:34:36,270
I'm heading to...

4989
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:37,070
Big dudes!

4990
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:37,830
Big dudes!

4991
02:34:38,210 --> 02:34:39,610
I'm heading to Lime, I'm heading to Lime.

4992
02:34:43,190 --> 02:34:44,090
Yeah, do that.

4993
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:47,030
Ok, I have like a guy that I have to kill.

4994
02:34:47,030 --> 02:34:48,210
We're gonna need help, I think.

4995
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:48,770
Ow.

4996
02:34:48,770 --> 02:34:50,330
Yeah, I bumped into a different guy.

4997
02:34:53,290 --> 02:34:53,610
Nice.

4998
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:55,510
There you go.

4999
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:57,270
If I could kill a horse?

5000
02:34:58,770 --> 02:34:59,890
Oh my gosh, shot him in the butt.

5001
02:35:01,050 --> 02:35:01,830
I'm shot him in the butt.

5002
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:03,030
I'm coming over.

5003
02:35:06,750 --> 02:35:08,030
Wait, where are you?

5004
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:10,110
Oh, I'm here, I'm here.

5005
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:11,150
Where is it?

5006
02:35:12,050 --> 02:35:13,130
Oh, they're at the top of here.

5007
02:35:13,850 --> 02:35:14,530
Oh, here's one.

5008
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:18,490
Ok.

5009
02:35:23,090 --> 02:35:23,470
What?

5010
02:35:23,730 --> 02:35:24,270
Oh, thanks then.

5011
02:35:28,590 --> 02:35:29,210
Got you.

5012
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:33,830
Ok, the other two are at the top.

5013
02:35:35,330 --> 02:35:36,410
Ok, I'm just gonna...

5014
02:35:36,790 --> 02:35:36,990
This.

5015
02:35:37,090 --> 02:35:37,510
These guys out.

5016
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:39,490
Alright, I'm with you.

5017
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:41,430
This way, this way.

5018
02:35:42,990 --> 02:35:44,430
Gonna get him out first.

5019
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:47,690
Alright, here I am.

5020
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:53,060
Whoa.

5021
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:55,680
I marked him first.

5022
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:56,980
Holy shit.

5023
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:58,580
Nice.

5024
02:35:58,780 --> 02:35:59,300
Last guy.

5025
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:00,820
Yup, yup, yup.

5026
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:01,460
We almost gonna ult this.

5027
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:01,900
Fuck it.

5028
02:36:05,890 --> 02:36:06,470
Fuck it.

5029
02:36:08,730 --> 02:36:09,370
Nice.

5030
02:36:12,510 --> 02:36:14,570
Heartbow great club.

5031
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:16,170
Very nice.

5032
02:36:17,570 --> 02:36:17,970
Ooh.

5033
02:36:18,590 --> 02:36:19,430
I'll take...

5034
02:36:19,430 --> 02:36:20,050
This.

5035
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:21,970
And then...

5036
02:36:21,970 --> 02:36:22,210
Ooh.

5037
02:36:23,230 --> 02:36:23,710
Sure.

5038
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:24,970
Pick it up.

5039
02:36:29,850 --> 02:36:32,250
I just realized I didn't pick up any items.

5040
02:36:32,550 --> 02:36:32,990
At all.

5041
02:36:33,490 --> 02:36:34,570
There's a level up here.

5042
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:35,610
Next to me?

5043
02:36:35,950 --> 02:36:36,730
Aw, that sucks.

5044
02:36:40,730 --> 02:36:42,150
Just pick up some items now.

5045
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:42,650
Oh, thank you.

5046
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:43,030
The grace.

5047
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:45,790
Alright.

5048
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:46,430
Okay.

5049
02:36:46,750 --> 02:36:48,050
We need to go in for the...

5050
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:48,370
Yeah.

5051
02:36:48,910 --> 02:36:50,230
I'm level seven right now.

5052
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:51,390
Same.

5053
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:04,660
Okay, not bad.

5054
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:05,380
Hey, look what I got.

5055
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:06,060
Whoa!

5056
02:37:06,380 --> 02:37:06,760
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5057
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:07,740
They like...

5058
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:09,120
Auto target enemies.

5059
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:09,920
Zoop, zoop, zoop, yeah.

5060
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:12,680
What do these trees do?

5061
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,840
I'm afraid to use it in case it takes me in the wrong place.

5062
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:18,900
It says that you like, move, but I don't know where specifically it goes.

5063
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:20,720
It says when there's a red hand over there.

5064
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:22,300
Oh, it's working.

5065
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:23,220
What?

5066
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,100
Hand...

5067
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:26,900
I think hand specifically means that you need like, uh...

5068
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:30,060
To, um...

5069
02:37:30,060 --> 02:37:30,400
Hold it?

5070
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:32,100
Have something held for its passive to work.

5071
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:32,340
Yeah.

5072
02:37:32,340 --> 02:37:32,720
Oh.

5073
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:33,360
Cave guys, help.

5074
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:37,560
Oh, it's fast travel.

5075
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:38,880
I don't know how to get down.

5076
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:39,720
Oh.

5077
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:40,640
It's a taxi.

5078
02:37:40,900 --> 02:37:41,200
Oh, I see.

5079
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:42,360
Oh, hello there.

5080
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:43,940
Hello.

5081
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:44,420
Hello.

5082
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:50,360
I'll stand next to you, so if I do aggro somebody, he'll be there too.

5083
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:52,840
Sounds good.

5084
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:54,040
Here we go.

5085
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:55,480
We can suffer together.

5086
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:00,140
Okay, I can mark these guys.

5087
02:38:02,980 --> 02:38:04,060
Oh, never mind.

5088
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:06,700
Apparently, they decided not to let me mark them.

5089
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:15,540
I'll mark him, though.

5090
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:20,620
Nice.

5091
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:22,080
I like the last one.

5092
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:22,960
Last guy is online.

5093
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:30,870
And he's dead.

5094
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:33,910
Oh.

5095
02:38:33,910 --> 02:38:34,310
What do we got?

5096
02:38:34,630 --> 02:38:35,150
Alright.

5097
02:38:35,870 --> 02:38:36,210
Oh.

5098
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:37,130
Tree spirit.

5099
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:37,850
Oh.

5100
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:38,670
God.

5101
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:39,830
Oh, it's him.

5102
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:40,770
Oh.

5103
02:38:40,770 --> 02:38:41,830
Hey, buddy.

5104
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:42,010
How's it going?

5105
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:42,170
Hey, buddy.

5106
02:38:42,910 --> 02:38:42,970
How's it going?

5107
02:38:42,990 --> 02:38:43,490
I have ult.

5108
02:38:43,750 --> 02:38:44,230
I do.

5109
02:38:44,610 --> 02:38:44,910
Okay.

5110
02:38:45,210 --> 02:38:46,870
I just gotta get out of the way of that.

5111
02:38:49,270 --> 02:38:49,990
I don't...

5112
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:51,130
Did I hit it?

5113
02:38:52,610 --> 02:38:53,450
I think so.

5114
02:38:55,470 --> 02:38:56,350
I marked it.

5115
02:38:56,790 --> 02:38:57,230
Jesus!

5116
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:04,410
I have re-wind again.

5117
02:39:05,390 --> 02:39:05,830
Okay.

5118
02:39:06,650 --> 02:39:07,070
Ow.

5119
02:39:07,570 --> 02:39:09,450
I don't have ult, so...

5120
02:39:09,450 --> 02:39:09,590
I don't have ult, so...

5121
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:10,470
It has to be Zen.

5122
02:39:12,630 --> 02:39:14,070
Just gonna try to...

5123
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:14,990
What?

5124
02:39:15,130 --> 02:39:15,330
Whoa!

5125
02:39:16,090 --> 02:39:16,750
Hello, guys.

5126
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:18,710
I don't have my ultimate, either.

5127
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:20,390
Oh my god!

5128
02:39:20,410 --> 02:39:22,030
I didn't think he was gonna slam on me again.

5129
02:39:24,570 --> 02:39:25,670
I don't know what that does.

5130
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:27,290
Kaboom!

5131
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:27,850
Oh.

5132
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:34,480
Oh.

5133
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:35,320
Oh, nice, nice, nice slam.

5134
02:39:36,220 --> 02:39:37,200
I marked it, too.

5135
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:42,690
Just gonna slam on me.

5136
02:39:42,810 --> 02:39:44,190
I keep pressing the wrong button.

5137
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:45,270
It's so tricky.

5138
02:39:45,710 --> 02:39:45,930
Okay.

5139
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:48,610
Shit.

5140
02:39:48,890 --> 02:39:49,470
He's gonna be on me?

5141
02:39:51,890 --> 02:39:52,330
Run!

5142
02:39:52,670 --> 02:39:53,970
Oh, he's using Explodee.

5143
02:39:54,090 --> 02:39:54,450
Never mind.

5144
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:55,070
Yup.

5145
02:40:03,130 --> 02:40:04,010
Oh, nice.

5146
02:40:04,990 --> 02:40:06,650
It's nice being an archer.

5147
02:40:09,770 --> 02:40:11,490
It's nice actually playing my class.

5148
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:15,210
Feels great, guys.

5149
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:16,310
I'm so happy.

5150
02:40:24,470 --> 02:40:25,030
Whoa.

5151
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:30,940
Nice.

5152
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:31,360
Hey!

5153
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:35,880
I think we're doing better for a level this time around.

5154
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:37,420
Yeah, I think so, too.

5155
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:45,790
Attack enemies die regardless of remaining HP on...

5156
02:40:46,530 --> 02:40:47,970
On rare occasion.

5157
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:49,730
Yeah, that's cool.

5158
02:40:49,930 --> 02:40:50,590
That one's good.

5159
02:40:50,750 --> 02:40:52,490
Sudden Endly Deaths.

5160
02:40:52,810 --> 02:40:53,130
Bang, that.

5161
02:40:54,190 --> 02:40:56,790
It might be this rare occasion for the end of us.

5162
02:40:58,010 --> 02:41:01,830
We should get that and then move up to, like, the castle, maybe?

5163
02:41:02,910 --> 02:41:05,690
Alternatively, we could run all the way around and try and get that big boss.

5164
02:41:05,910 --> 02:41:05,930
Yeah, good idea.

5165
02:41:05,930 --> 02:41:08,430
But I think I don't really want to fight the bird who scares me.

5166
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:08,690
Ouch.

5167
02:41:10,290 --> 02:41:10,810
Alright.

5168
02:41:11,350 --> 02:41:12,050
Let's go.

5169
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:16,030
We need to try and get at least level 13 or something.

5170
02:41:17,350 --> 02:41:18,390
And not be under level.

5171
02:41:19,090 --> 02:41:21,730
I mean, 13 is still under level, but like it's better than...

5172
02:41:21,730 --> 02:41:22,390
Oh god, the creepy cat!

5173
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:25,850
He's gonna ground and he's gonna pound.

5174
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:28,250
He's so easy.

5175
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:29,710
We got this.

5176
02:41:30,470 --> 02:41:31,490
Jesus, I...

5177
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:34,010
I'm aggroing not him for some reason.

5178
02:41:35,650 --> 02:41:36,670
You're not melting this.

5179
02:41:37,750 --> 02:41:38,830
Get his ass.

5180
02:41:40,250 --> 02:41:40,710
Nice.

5181
02:41:41,970 --> 02:41:42,430
Rip that guy.

5182
02:41:42,610 --> 02:41:43,130
Where's the other one?

5183
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:45,330
Another one.

5184
02:41:46,050 --> 02:41:46,390
Yeah.

5185
02:41:47,710 --> 02:41:48,510
Where is he?

5186
02:41:49,730 --> 02:41:50,610
I don't know.

5187
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:52,410
I'm gonna try the other direction.

5188
02:41:52,650 --> 02:41:53,710
I think he's on the other side.

5189
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:55,130
Ouch.

5190
02:41:58,150 --> 02:42:00,550
Just kill the mini guys real quick.

5191
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:02,250
Oh, he's here?

5192
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:02,810
Alright.

5193
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:03,490
Heading over.

5194
02:42:08,010 --> 02:42:08,530
Weeeee!

5195
02:42:08,970 --> 02:42:09,810
Here I am.

5196
02:42:10,910 --> 02:42:11,890
Marked him, Rez.

5197
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:18,110
Rez.

5198
02:42:18,230 --> 02:42:18,330
Nice.

5199
02:42:21,370 --> 02:42:21,890
Woo!

5200
02:42:24,610 --> 02:42:25,810
Yeah, we needed that.

5201
02:42:27,730 --> 02:42:28,870
What the fuck?

5202
02:42:29,170 --> 02:42:30,510
There's a little underground area.

5203
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:33,490
Are you...

5204
02:42:33,490 --> 02:42:35,770
And he still keeps going?

5205
02:42:36,550 --> 02:42:37,930
Do you want to get the underground stuff?

5206
02:42:38,250 --> 02:42:39,170
I don't know where it is.

5207
02:42:39,610 --> 02:42:40,010
Oh, I see it.

5208
02:42:40,370 --> 02:42:41,750
It's good to be an archer.

5209
02:42:43,690 --> 02:42:45,570
It's just loot, I'm pretty sure, down there.

5210
02:42:46,270 --> 02:42:47,050
Yeah, it is.

5211
02:42:47,350 --> 02:42:47,450
Yeah.

5212
02:42:49,730 --> 02:42:50,650
Just archer things.

5213
02:42:57,010 --> 02:42:58,150
Just archer things.

5214
02:42:59,590 --> 02:43:00,610
Nothing down here.

5215
02:43:01,410 --> 02:43:01,990
Not really.

5216
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:11,180
Is it still good to be an archer, Doki?

5217
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:12,020
I love archer.

5218
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:14,140
Oh, there's a big guy right by us.

5219
02:43:14,220 --> 02:43:14,760
Do we want to try him?

5220
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:15,280
Yeah, yeah.

5221
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:16,820
Okay.

5222
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:18,740
I fell down to the hole.

5223
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:19,120
Let's do it.

5224
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:23,180
Oh, it's a dragon.

5225
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:24,900
Oh, no, no, no.

5226
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:25,720
It's a salamander.

5227
02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:27,760
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

5228
02:43:28,580 --> 02:43:28,860
Okay.

5229
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:32,860
Whoa.

5230
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:36,960
I'm just gonna get rid of the little guys real quick.

5231
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:38,060
Cause they're following us.

5232
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:39,200
And they're throwing jars.

5233
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:40,580
And I don't like that.

5234
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,120
Please don't.

5235
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:41,780
Please don't.

5236
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:42,960
I'm running.

5237
02:43:43,140 --> 02:43:43,560
I'm heading over.

5238
02:43:52,550 --> 02:43:53,290
Is he looking at me?

5239
02:43:53,430 --> 02:43:53,750
I don't like how much...

5240
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:54,330
Oh, no, he's not.

5241
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:55,810
I have ult soon.

5242
02:43:56,070 --> 02:43:56,770
You can save rewind.

5243
02:43:58,090 --> 02:43:58,670
I have ult here.

5244
02:43:59,530 --> 02:44:00,050
Get him.

5245
02:44:02,110 --> 02:44:02,510
Ulting.

5246
02:44:03,450 --> 02:44:03,850
Ulted.

5247
02:44:06,150 --> 02:44:07,130
And I marked him too.

5248
02:44:18,490 --> 02:44:19,390
Oh, nice, nice.

5249
02:44:19,710 --> 02:44:20,470
I needed that too.

5250
02:44:21,750 --> 02:44:22,150
Nice.

5251
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:27,150
Okay.

5252
02:44:27,290 --> 02:44:27,630
Oh.

5253
02:44:28,210 --> 02:44:28,610
What?

5254
02:44:29,370 --> 02:44:30,010
We're down.

5255
02:44:30,350 --> 02:44:30,450
Down.

5256
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:31,090
Move us down.

5257
02:44:31,330 --> 02:44:32,210
The tail swipe got us.

5258
02:44:32,570 --> 02:44:32,730
Yeah.

5259
02:44:34,350 --> 02:44:34,750
That's...

5260
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:35,130
Is that game?

5261
02:44:36,490 --> 02:44:37,350
No, no, no, no.

5262
02:44:37,650 --> 02:44:38,050
No, no, no.

5263
02:44:38,250 --> 02:44:38,990
Hit Lime if you can't.

5264
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:40,750
I'm a shooter shooter too.

5265
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:41,350
I'm a shooter too.

5266
02:44:41,710 --> 02:44:42,010
Alright.

5267
02:44:42,430 --> 02:44:42,770
Thank you.

5268
02:44:42,990 --> 02:44:43,190
I'm healing.

5269
02:44:43,890 --> 02:44:46,250
That tail swipe actually was crazy.

5270
02:44:47,230 --> 02:44:47,490
Uh, yeah.

5271
02:44:47,550 --> 02:44:48,010
That fucked me up.

5272
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:52,950
I didn't expect the tail swipe to...

5273
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:55,210
Why is this on the same freaking button?

5274
02:44:55,790 --> 02:44:57,970
This is why I don't use both weapons.

5275
02:45:01,740 --> 02:45:02,440
Oh heck.

5276
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:06,940
Oh!

5277
02:45:07,820 --> 02:45:08,640
Oh, he...

5278
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:09,620
He missed that one.

5279
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:14,700
I'm just worried about a tail right now.

5280
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:17,560
I, um...

5281
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:17,680
He's doing it?

5282
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:18,440
I gave you guys weak points.

5283
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,340
I gave you guys weak points.

5284
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:20,540
Thank you.

5285
02:45:24,750 --> 02:45:25,610
She's so low.

5286
02:45:25,730 --> 02:45:26,090
He's one.

5287
02:45:29,070 --> 02:45:29,530
Nice.

5288
02:45:29,770 --> 02:45:30,050
Nice.

5289
02:45:31,810 --> 02:45:32,250
Ooh.

5290
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:36,550
Oh, I...

5291
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:36,650
Wait.

5292
02:45:36,850 --> 02:45:37,970
Do any of you guys use slade?

5293
02:45:38,170 --> 02:45:38,430
Good stuff.

5294
02:45:38,430 --> 02:45:40,070
I have a golden blade and a...

5295
02:45:40,070 --> 02:45:40,090
Good stuff.

5296
02:45:40,310 --> 02:45:41,990
140 attack axe.

5297
02:45:42,170 --> 02:45:43,630
A big blade or a small blade?

5298
02:45:43,810 --> 02:45:44,930
Um, blasphemous blade.

5299
02:45:45,450 --> 02:45:46,990
I got the blasphemous blade too.

5300
02:45:47,370 --> 02:45:47,870
But it's gold.

5301
02:45:48,110 --> 02:45:48,710
It's pretty hot.

5302
02:45:49,590 --> 02:45:50,370
Is it gold?

5303
02:45:51,270 --> 02:45:51,990
Yeah, yeah.

5304
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:52,410
Okay.

5305
02:45:52,410 --> 02:45:53,210
Let me see that.

5306
02:45:53,970 --> 02:45:54,770
You want it?

5307
02:45:54,830 --> 02:45:55,410
Does it do good?

5308
02:45:55,750 --> 02:45:56,130
Okay.

5309
02:45:56,290 --> 02:45:57,090
I'll grab it too.

5310
02:45:57,770 --> 02:45:58,310
Here you guys.

5311
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:00,690
Um...

5312
02:46:00,690 --> 02:46:00,890
Here.

5313
02:46:02,330 --> 02:46:02,690
I'll...

5314
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:03,530
Does anyone want it?

5315
02:46:04,490 --> 02:46:05,250
I dropped it.

5316
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:05,770
I got one.

5317
02:46:05,930 --> 02:46:06,270
I have one.

5318
02:46:06,370 --> 02:46:07,170
I know, but Zen said...

5319
02:46:07,170 --> 02:46:07,370
Yeah.

5320
02:46:07,650 --> 02:46:08,630
Let me see that.

5321
02:46:09,090 --> 02:46:10,090
It's there on the floor there.

5322
02:46:10,150 --> 02:46:10,290
Yeah.

5323
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:13,230
There's continuous HP recovery.

5324
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:15,990
We should go to the castle.

5325
02:46:16,230 --> 02:46:18,290
I'll grab it if you don't want it so I can get the stat.

5326
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:19,530
That actually might be good for me.

5327
02:46:19,730 --> 02:46:19,990
Yeah?

5328
02:46:20,430 --> 02:46:21,030
You should grab it.

5329
02:46:23,270 --> 02:46:25,050
And then I'll take this one.

5330
02:46:25,230 --> 02:46:25,690
Attack up.

5331
02:46:25,890 --> 02:46:27,010
I'm willing to arm it.

5332
02:46:27,010 --> 02:46:27,590
What is that?

5333
02:46:27,730 --> 02:46:28,290
What's armament?

5334
02:46:28,410 --> 02:46:28,770
I don't know.

5335
02:46:28,910 --> 02:46:29,430
I'll pick it up.

5336
02:46:30,510 --> 02:46:31,650
Armament is weapon.

5337
02:46:32,230 --> 02:46:32,450
Ah.

5338
02:46:37,210 --> 02:46:40,310
Yeah, but I think it's better on Zen because she's melee.

5339
02:46:40,690 --> 02:46:41,690
I mean Zen, do you want two?

5340
02:46:41,990 --> 02:46:43,290
You can power stun some maybe.

5341
02:46:44,250 --> 02:46:44,570
Yeah.

5342
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:48,920
Yeah.

5343
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:50,660
Let me see what you got there.

5344
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:51,540
Okay.

5345
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:54,780
Do you stack it though?

5346
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:56,580
Is it stackable?

5347
02:46:57,520 --> 02:46:57,920
Is it stackable?

5348
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,780
And then if you both have it, you can both regen.

5349
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:04,670
Also, we need to level up.

5350
02:47:04,770 --> 02:47:05,630
If you find a great...

5351
02:47:05,630 --> 02:47:07,090
I need a grace to level up.

5352
02:47:10,570 --> 02:47:11,690
Every freaking time.

5353
02:47:11,690 --> 02:47:11,710
Every freaking time.

5354
02:47:15,510 --> 02:47:16,370
Oh my god.

5355
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:18,270
Uh...

5356
02:47:19,050 --> 02:47:21,330
I think you should both each have one just cause like...

5357
02:47:21,330 --> 02:47:21,890
So it can stack.

5358
02:47:22,030 --> 02:47:23,750
So you can both restore HP.

5359
02:47:24,450 --> 02:47:27,490
I mean, if Zen's not gonna dual wield them, I will.

5360
02:47:27,730 --> 02:47:28,650
But if she is, I won't.

5361
02:47:30,010 --> 02:47:31,110
Oh, we should go down to the castle.

5362
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:31,310
Yeah.

5363
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:36,170
Oh.

5364
02:47:36,370 --> 02:47:36,490
Okay.

5365
02:47:43,410 --> 02:47:44,910
I'm heading down to the castle.

5366
02:47:44,950 --> 02:47:48,050
I just need one more lever for these and I can use both of them.

5367
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:48,930
Okay.

5368
02:47:49,230 --> 02:47:49,510
Alright.

5369
02:47:52,210 --> 02:47:52,690
Weeeee.

5370
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:55,950
Let's go get this boss then.

5371
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:01,010
Alright.

5372
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:03,990
We better kill this boss so I can level up.

5373
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:04,850
I can ult this too.

5374
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:05,890
Oh, it's the big... it's the dog.

5375
02:48:06,070 --> 02:48:06,270
Okay.

5376
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:10,090
Easy.

5377
02:48:11,190 --> 02:48:11,950
I hit him.

5378
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:12,670
Ow.

5379
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:13,890
Oh my god.

5380
02:48:14,570 --> 02:48:15,450
I'm sorry.

5381
02:48:17,850 --> 02:48:18,290
Okay.

5382
02:48:18,670 --> 02:48:18,930
Yeah.

5383
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:21,330
He's on me.

5384
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:22,230
He's on me.

5385
02:48:22,330 --> 02:48:23,450
I'm just a little guy.

5386
02:48:24,350 --> 02:48:25,610
Uh, get him out of the corridor if you can.

5387
02:48:25,710 --> 02:48:26,110
Come back in here.

5388
02:48:26,370 --> 02:48:27,110
I'm trying.

5389
02:48:29,590 --> 02:48:30,930
Don't let him stay in there.

5390
02:48:32,230 --> 02:48:33,050
How's it going?

5391
02:48:33,690 --> 02:48:34,750
Um, he's not coming back.

5392
02:48:35,790 --> 02:48:36,210
Bruh, come back.

5393
02:48:36,210 --> 02:48:36,830
Bruh, come back.

5394
02:48:37,050 --> 02:48:38,170
Wait, where the fuck did he go?

5395
02:48:38,310 --> 02:48:39,170
He's just stuck.

5396
02:48:39,410 --> 02:48:40,050
Is he stuck?

5397
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:40,770
Oh god.

5398
02:48:41,690 --> 02:48:42,450
I...

5399
02:48:42,890 --> 02:48:46,150
I did not want him to follow me, but he decided to.

5400
02:48:48,010 --> 02:48:48,470
Okay.

5401
02:48:48,550 --> 02:48:48,970
Bring him in.

5402
02:48:50,670 --> 02:48:51,430
Zen!

5403
02:48:51,690 --> 02:48:52,550
Bring him in!

5404
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:55,530
I don't think...

5405
02:48:56,070 --> 02:48:57,370
I'm like...

5406
02:48:57,670 --> 02:48:58,910
So confused.

5407
02:48:59,730 --> 02:49:00,250
Okay.

5408
02:49:00,690 --> 02:49:01,150
Sir!

5409
02:49:01,510 --> 02:49:02,050
Please!

5410
02:49:02,310 --> 02:49:02,910
Come in!

5411
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:04,350
Thank you!

5412
02:49:04,350 --> 02:49:04,870
Oh my god.

5413
02:49:07,630 --> 02:49:08,610
Get up.

5414
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:10,030
Okay.

5415
02:49:11,550 --> 02:49:11,950
Yeah!

5416
02:49:12,290 --> 02:49:12,810
Yeah, alright.

5417
02:49:15,430 --> 02:49:16,810
That guy sucked.

5418
02:49:18,310 --> 02:49:18,810
Oh!

5419
02:49:19,350 --> 02:49:19,610
Hello!

5420
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:21,010
I got a good bow.

5421
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:25,710
What does the blood blade do?

5422
02:49:26,870 --> 02:49:29,010
Does anybody need a freaking width?

5423
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:30,310
No.

5424
02:49:32,030 --> 02:49:33,030
I'm level 10.

5425
02:49:33,670 --> 02:49:35,610
We need to get two more levels at least.

5426
02:49:39,850 --> 02:49:40,670
I'm heading up.

5427
02:49:40,670 --> 02:49:43,310
I guess I can use the benefit then.

5428
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:50,840
Will I continue to get these swords?

5429
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:52,100
Yeah, apparently I do.

5430
02:49:52,280 --> 02:49:52,540
Sweet!

5431
02:49:53,480 --> 02:49:54,500
Raises attack power.

5432
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:55,720
Raises vitality.

5433
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:56,220
What's...

5434
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:57,400
Vitality is HP, right?

5435
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:02,440
Hmm...

5436
02:50:02,780 --> 02:50:03,100
Okay.

5437
02:50:11,810 --> 02:50:12,870
Get two?

5438
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:15,510
Okay.

5439
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:22,200
Resistance to death flight?

5440
02:50:23,060 --> 02:50:25,000
What's resistance to death flight?

5441
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:28,400
Oh!

5442
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:29,220
Oh!

5443
02:50:29,540 --> 02:50:30,400
Which one should I get?

5444
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:32,020
Two or three guys winged?

5445
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:32,960
Okay.

5446
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:35,780
Alright, let's go.

5447
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:40,760
Uh, there's some big bosses and an Estus in the fucking...

5448
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:41,800
In the crater again!

5449
02:50:41,960 --> 02:50:43,220
I hate that crater so much!

5450
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:46,200
Grab this.

5451
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:47,480
Oh no!

5452
02:50:47,740 --> 02:50:49,160
Is that what I think it is?

5453
02:50:53,970 --> 02:50:54,570
Oh wait!

5454
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:55,410
I'm not light...

5455
02:50:55,410 --> 02:50:56,250
Oh my god, I'm dumb.

5456
02:50:56,790 --> 02:50:57,710
I thought it was light.

5457
02:50:58,210 --> 02:50:59,270
Why not, was it?

5458
02:51:00,770 --> 02:51:02,590
I forgot to replace my...

5459
02:51:02,590 --> 02:51:04,010
Bow status.

5460
02:51:04,590 --> 02:51:05,870
We need to find one more boss.

5461
02:51:09,570 --> 02:51:10,910
I mean, we can go this way.

5462
02:51:10,910 --> 02:51:12,830
Oh god, it's that fucking griffin again.

5463
02:51:15,150 --> 02:51:16,050
You wanna try him?

5464
02:51:17,470 --> 02:51:17,890
Uh...

5465
02:51:17,890 --> 02:51:18,830
Where are we on the map?

5466
02:51:20,410 --> 02:51:21,170
Right next to him.

5467
02:51:22,350 --> 02:51:22,990
We could try.

5468
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:23,870
Zen, where are you?

5469
02:51:24,670 --> 02:51:25,350
Gargoyle thing.

5470
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:27,710
Oh boy.

5471
02:51:29,310 --> 02:51:30,230
Right above.

5472
02:51:31,510 --> 02:51:34,210
Yeah, we gotta like, run run if we...

5473
02:51:35,810 --> 02:51:36,410
After...

5474
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:39,000
Ow.

5475
02:51:39,640 --> 02:51:40,720
I'm not doing damage.

5476
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:42,160
I'm stuck on the fucking terrain!

5477
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:43,620
Oh my god, I'm gonna...

5478
02:51:43,620 --> 02:51:44,680
I just instantly got dropped.

5479
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:46,360
Uh...

5480
02:51:46,360 --> 02:51:46,940
I got you.

5481
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:47,920
What's the thing?

5482
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:48,440
Oh god!

5483
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:49,920
I got you, I got you, I got you.

5484
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:52,960
Holy...

5485
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:53,900
Oh.

5486
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:56,320
Hum...

5487
02:51:57,020 --> 02:51:58,920
I marked him, but...

5488
02:51:58,920 --> 02:52:00,300
But yeah.

5489
02:52:01,140 --> 02:52:01,720
I...

5490
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:03,700
I have like, uh...

5491
02:52:03,700 --> 02:52:04,260
Ult soon.

5492
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:06,620
Oh yeah.

5493
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:08,420
Let's get him off that terrain.

5494
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:10,300
That's gonna be awkward.

5495
02:52:11,580 --> 02:52:12,200
I...

5496
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:13,860
The place that this guy is just sucks.

5497
02:52:14,220 --> 02:52:14,540
Oh.

5498
02:52:14,940 --> 02:52:15,320
Yeah.

5499
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:16,460
Pull over here.

5500
02:52:16,460 --> 02:52:16,840
He...

5501
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:18,140
I have ult, I have ult.

5502
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:18,400
I'm using it.

5503
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:19,660
It's up in the same place as usual.

5504
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:21,480
I have it, yes.

5505
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:22,160
I have it, I have it, I have it.

5506
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:22,800
You have rewind.

5507
02:52:24,420 --> 02:52:24,560
Yup.

5508
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:24,800
That's good.

5509
02:52:27,800 --> 02:52:28,660
I'm gonna mark him.

5510
02:52:29,580 --> 02:52:31,500
Oh my god, he bounced away from...

5511
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:31,780
From mark.

5512
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:33,840
I'm looking at map.

5513
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:34,680
It's fast.

5514
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:35,500
It's approaching fast.

5515
02:52:35,620 --> 02:52:36,280
We have to kill him.

5516
02:52:39,380 --> 02:52:39,960
Oh shit.

5517
02:52:45,870 --> 02:52:46,490
Nice dagger.

5518
02:52:51,430 --> 02:52:52,890
Oh my god, he's so close to die.

5519
02:52:53,330 --> 02:52:53,590
Nice.

5520
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:54,750
One hit, one hit, one hit.

5521
02:52:54,930 --> 02:52:55,170
Nice.

5522
02:52:55,610 --> 02:52:55,870
Yes.

5523
02:52:56,170 --> 02:52:57,110
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5524
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:57,450
Oh my god, we have to hurt her.

5525
02:52:59,870 --> 02:53:00,550
Good stuff.

5526
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:04,570
Ugh, I did not know...

5527
02:53:04,570 --> 02:53:05,750
Oh my god, there's a huge...

5528
02:53:05,750 --> 02:53:06,810
Okay, I'm getting this though.

5529
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:07,830
I don't...

5530
02:53:07,830 --> 02:53:08,470
I'm just not worth...

5531
02:53:08,470 --> 02:53:09,290
I couldn't grab the...

5532
02:53:09,290 --> 02:53:10,330
I couldn't check what the blade...

5533
02:53:10,330 --> 02:53:11,370
It's not worth dying to the zone.

5534
02:53:12,530 --> 02:53:14,130
Oh, I couldn't see what the blade was.

5535
02:53:14,650 --> 02:53:15,850
I just went for the status.

5536
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:21,500
No time.

5537
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:23,560
Yeah, no time.

5538
02:53:31,390 --> 02:53:32,690
There's no time, chat.

5539
02:53:33,090 --> 02:53:33,990
I didn't know what...

5540
02:53:33,990 --> 02:53:35,430
Are you fucking kidding?

5541
02:53:35,730 --> 02:53:35,930
Oh!

5542
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:38,610
Don't press forward when you're in the things.

5543
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:39,510
I know, I know.

5544
02:53:39,510 --> 02:53:40,050
It just puts you in the wall.

5545
02:53:46,290 --> 02:53:48,210
Me, when I don't learn my lesson.

5546
02:53:48,430 --> 02:53:50,670
Yeah, I didn't learn my lesson again.

5547
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:52,310
I did it a bunch last night.

5548
02:53:52,430 --> 02:53:56,370
I didn't get to...

5549
02:53:56,370 --> 02:53:57,010
So...

5550
02:53:57,010 --> 02:53:58,090
No, neither did I.

5551
02:53:58,190 --> 02:53:59,070
We can do it after the boss.

5552
02:54:00,350 --> 02:54:03,370
I feel like we did really well for levels the first map.

5553
02:54:03,510 --> 02:54:04,690
And then fell behind the second map.

5554
02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:05,810
Um...

5555
02:54:05,810 --> 02:54:07,590
I feel like we could kill this boss.

5556
02:54:07,710 --> 02:54:08,390
And we can lead her.

5557
02:54:08,770 --> 02:54:09,110
Of course.

5558
02:54:10,550 --> 02:54:10,950
Yeah.

5559
02:54:11,250 --> 02:54:11,630
Yeah, okay.

5560
02:54:11,850 --> 02:54:12,310
I'll grab...

5561
02:54:12,310 --> 02:54:12,870
I'll try to lead her.

5562
02:54:14,310 --> 02:54:14,710
She's...

5563
02:54:14,710 --> 02:54:16,330
It's closing real fast though.

5564
02:54:17,350 --> 02:54:17,870
Be careful.

5565
02:54:17,870 --> 02:54:18,490
Guys, the circle.

5566
02:54:19,130 --> 02:54:19,770
I know, I'm trying to...

5567
02:54:19,770 --> 02:54:21,050
Yeah, the circle is a dick.

5568
02:54:22,810 --> 02:54:24,690
Okay, I'm just gonna...

5569
02:54:24,690 --> 02:54:25,450
Yeah, no, we leave.

5570
02:54:25,650 --> 02:54:26,870
Yeah, we leave, we leave, we leave.

5571
02:54:26,990 --> 02:54:28,190
I don't think I can do it.

5572
02:54:30,430 --> 02:54:31,410
I'm too scared.

5573
02:54:32,670 --> 02:54:33,610
Wait, where is this?

5574
02:54:33,870 --> 02:54:34,430
Is it here?

5575
02:54:34,630 --> 02:54:35,190
Am I here?

5576
02:54:35,910 --> 02:54:36,590
Oh, I'm here.

5577
02:54:36,690 --> 02:54:37,430
I don't know, are you here?

5578
02:54:37,570 --> 02:54:38,350
Are any of us here?

5579
02:54:38,470 --> 02:54:39,290
Yeah, am I here?

5580
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:40,710
Wait, no, she's coming over.

5581
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:42,870
Nothing.

5582
02:54:49,630 --> 02:54:51,430
She's slowly coming over to me, guys.

5583
02:54:58,820 --> 02:55:01,080
I don't know if I can actually get her to us.

5584
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:03,140
Nah, no, it's fine.

5585
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:04,020
We'll do the end.

5586
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:08,320
I think she might activate into this.

5587
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:12,480
We don't want that, because we'll have two bosses.

5588
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:14,160
Yeah, um...

5589
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:15,100
It's too late.

5590
02:55:16,020 --> 02:55:16,720
Oh, hell.

5591
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:20,400
It's too late, I already did it.

5592
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:21,520
Okay, what's going on, bro?

5593
02:55:26,070 --> 02:55:27,470
I don't think you can do anything.

5594
02:55:28,230 --> 02:55:29,130
No, you're not.

5595
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:37,280
Nice.

5596
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:39,580
I have ult earlier to the boss, by the way.

5597
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:43,420
What is going on with me?

5598
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:44,360
Kaboom.

5599
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:45,840
Alright, I'm gonna ult here.

5600
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:46,500
Do you have rewind?

5601
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:47,780
Oh, okay.

5602
02:55:47,820 --> 02:55:48,160
Oh, not again?

5603
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:49,020
Oh, no.

5604
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:50,460
The agonic version.

5605
02:55:50,460 --> 02:55:51,600
I don't want it.

5606
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:52,760
I don't want it.

5607
02:55:52,900 --> 02:55:53,660
I ult it early.

5608
02:55:53,980 --> 02:55:54,680
I really don't want it.

5609
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:58,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

5610
02:55:59,980 --> 02:56:02,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

5611
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:05,340
Nice.

5612
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:08,140
I'm on the other cavalry.

5613
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:10,280
Get that motherfucker.

5614
02:56:10,980 --> 02:56:12,580
The Sentinels are very close.

5615
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:13,120
Be careful.

5616
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:16,800
Okay, I marked the cavalry guy.

5617
02:56:17,060 --> 02:56:18,020
One cavalry down.

5618
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,480
See, three Sentinels on me, so I'm just gonna dodge for a while.

5619
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:23,760
I'm on the first cavalry guy.

5620
02:56:25,100 --> 02:56:26,200
Alright, you kill that guy.

5621
02:56:26,620 --> 02:56:28,240
I'll just have fun with this one.

5622
02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:29,740
Okay, I marked him again.

5623
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:35,240
Nice, we got both, we got both.

5624
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:36,660
Charging coming.

5625
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:39,500
Who's gonna heal for now?

5626
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:41,300
Okay.

5627
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:45,320
Guys, I have a broken combo and I'm so ready for this.

5628
02:56:45,820 --> 02:56:46,300
Nice.

5629
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:48,180
That's what I like to hear.

5630
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:50,640
I don't like any of this.

5631
02:56:52,860 --> 02:56:53,960
Holy moly.

5632
02:56:55,340 --> 02:56:56,520
I'm gonna mark him.

5633
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:59,080
Oh, he dodged my mark.

5634
02:57:02,810 --> 02:57:03,490
Jesus.

5635
02:57:08,670 --> 02:57:09,890
The rewind!

5636
02:57:11,570 --> 02:57:12,650
I'm marking him?

5637
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:13,730
Marked him?

5638
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:15,710
Nice, nice.

5639
02:57:18,790 --> 02:57:21,850
Okay, I'm just gonna wait until...

5640
02:57:21,850 --> 02:57:22,790
Back it up, there's charging?

5641
02:57:23,170 --> 02:57:23,430
Yep.

5642
02:57:24,730 --> 02:57:26,290
He's on, they're on, they're, they're...

5643
02:57:26,290 --> 02:57:27,290
He's marked on Zen.

5644
02:57:28,150 --> 02:57:29,330
I have ult here.

5645
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:30,370
Do you have rewind?

5646
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:30,790
Woo!

5647
02:57:31,170 --> 02:57:31,610
Yes.

5648
02:57:31,930 --> 02:57:32,050
Okay.

5649
02:57:32,750 --> 02:57:33,050
Ulting?

5650
02:57:33,770 --> 02:57:34,070
Ult it.

5651
02:57:37,070 --> 02:57:37,630
Nice.

5652
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:41,600
I got that.

5653
02:57:45,210 --> 02:57:46,190
Nice, he's one.

5654
02:57:46,390 --> 02:57:46,970
What's up?

5655
02:57:47,350 --> 02:57:48,010
Come on.

5656
02:57:49,230 --> 02:57:49,690
Yeah!

5657
02:57:50,030 --> 02:57:50,370
Yeah!

5658
02:57:50,950 --> 02:57:51,390
Easy!

5659
02:57:51,790 --> 02:57:52,070
Yeah!

5660
02:57:53,430 --> 02:57:53,710
Woo!

5661
02:57:54,270 --> 02:57:54,450
Woo!

5662
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:56,450
Alright.

5663
02:57:59,710 --> 02:58:01,450
Physical damage negation?

5664
02:58:01,770 --> 02:58:03,170
I'm gonna grab that.

5665
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:06,470
Wait, raise resistance to all elements.

5666
02:58:06,470 --> 02:58:06,950
I don't know what happens there.

5667
02:58:06,950 --> 02:58:07,210
Do I?

5668
02:58:07,410 --> 02:58:08,430
Oh my god, guys.

5669
02:58:08,630 --> 02:58:10,450
Elements or damage negation?

5670
02:58:12,790 --> 02:58:14,950
I don't know what the last boss is, so...

5671
02:58:14,950 --> 02:58:16,330
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

5672
02:58:17,290 --> 02:58:19,210
I didn't get the damage negation.

5673
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:20,330
Okay.

5674
02:58:20,330 --> 02:58:20,390
Okay.

5675
02:58:20,390 --> 02:58:21,310
I got more glint blades.

5676
02:58:21,450 --> 02:58:23,650
I have two sets of glint blades that keep popping, but...

5677
02:58:25,810 --> 02:58:26,370
Let's see.

5678
02:58:27,750 --> 02:58:31,670
I think they overrate each other, but it's fine, because when one's on cooldown and the other one will just pop, I guess.

5679
02:58:32,290 --> 02:58:33,770
Alright, one just to be safe.

5680
02:58:33,890 --> 02:58:34,090
Okay.

5681
02:58:37,470 --> 02:58:37,830
Okay.

5682
02:58:37,830 --> 02:58:39,030
Okay, I hit 12, which is nice.

5683
02:58:39,390 --> 02:58:39,430
Alright.

5684
02:58:39,690 --> 02:58:40,790
Then that means I'll be 12, too.

5685
02:58:40,990 --> 02:58:42,170
Since we are, like, dissimilar.

5686
02:58:43,930 --> 02:58:44,970
Yeah, I'm level 12.

5687
02:58:45,430 --> 02:58:46,790
How do they get to level 15?

5688
02:58:48,050 --> 02:58:49,210
I don't understand!

5689
02:58:49,210 --> 02:58:53,410
I don't know.

5690
02:58:53,750 --> 02:58:55,270
Yeah, they all stack, unfortunately.

5691
02:58:58,750 --> 02:58:59,890
Maybe I should grab another.

5692
02:59:00,130 --> 02:59:02,070
We don't have Bamko here to give us tips this time.

5693
02:59:02,330 --> 02:59:03,530
What could possibly go wrong?

5694
02:59:03,570 --> 02:59:04,610
I'm ready for this fight.

5695
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:06,570
I have never been more ready.

5696
02:59:06,910 --> 02:59:09,170
Bandai's on my... in my... in my stream.

5697
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:11,310
He came back.

5698
02:59:12,030 --> 02:59:13,190
He likes me more.

5699
02:59:14,370 --> 02:59:16,590
I'm so confident that I can do this.

5700
02:59:17,430 --> 02:59:18,730
Alright, yeah, I believe in Zen.

5701
02:59:19,990 --> 02:59:21,690
We have, like, a really broken setup.

5702
02:59:22,090 --> 02:59:22,290
Yeah.

5703
02:59:22,510 --> 02:59:23,230
On Zen, at least.

5704
02:59:23,470 --> 02:59:23,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5705
02:59:23,770 --> 02:59:26,570
Zen is, like, our actual, like, DPS lineup.

5706
02:59:27,430 --> 02:59:28,330
She's our tank now.

5707
02:59:29,530 --> 02:59:30,870
They always come back.

5708
02:59:37,890 --> 02:59:39,110
Push that cave!

5709
02:59:50,850 --> 02:59:52,710
I really like using the rewind.

5710
02:59:53,050 --> 02:59:55,810
Like, when it lines up perfectly, things just explode.

5711
02:59:56,530 --> 02:59:56,670
Yeah, our combos.

5712
02:59:56,910 --> 02:59:58,530
The combo shit is so strong.

5713
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:04,840
Especially when, like, it double staggers to a rewind.

5714
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:05,740
Mm-mm.

5715
03:00:08,220 --> 03:00:08,820
Alright, Zen.

5716
03:00:08,960 --> 03:00:09,620
Carry us.

5717
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:10,980
Carry I'm and I.

5718
03:00:11,700 --> 03:00:12,780
Gamer of the year!

5719
03:00:14,380 --> 03:00:15,540
I will do this.

5720
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:21,940
I don't like this.

5721
03:00:22,060 --> 03:00:24,520
Let me just double check out my stuff here before we start.

5722
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:27,100
I don't know if we're gonna be allowed to do that.

5723
03:00:27,300 --> 03:00:28,360
This is scary.

5724
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:30,900
I accidentally used my item.

5725
03:00:31,100 --> 03:00:32,000
I don't know what it was.

5726
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:33,280
Okay.

5727
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:34,680
Okay.

5728
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:35,500
Good times.

5729
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:37,740
I accidentally used two items.

5730
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:38,380
Alright.

5731
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:40,100
Let's do this.

5732
03:00:41,320 --> 03:00:42,120
Let's do it.

5733
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:43,940
Oh my god.

5734
03:00:44,020 --> 03:00:46,020
Why did I get the damage elements?

5735
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:47,460
He's ice!

5736
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:49,220
He's ice!

5737
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:54,220
Okay.

5738
03:00:56,980 --> 03:00:57,540
Who's he?

5739
03:00:57,780 --> 03:00:59,220
I don't know his movesets.

5740
03:01:00,460 --> 03:01:00,620
Shit.

5741
03:01:02,920 --> 03:01:03,840
Ow.

5742
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:08,360
I don't know what he does.

5743
03:01:08,700 --> 03:01:09,200
What the fuck?

5744
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:11,580
Oh my god!

5745
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:12,820
That's the wrong button.

5746
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:16,320
Alright, off we go.

5747
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:17,020
Wow!

5748
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:24,340
If you can mark his feet rather than his head, because neither Zen or I hit that most of the time.

5749
03:01:24,340 --> 03:01:24,780
I can't.

5750
03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:25,760
It's like...

5751
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:27,120
It only does like...

5752
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:27,880
It's uh...

5753
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:28,300
What's it called?

5754
03:01:29,820 --> 03:01:30,540
It's uh...

5755
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:30,920
Auto.

5756
03:01:31,160 --> 03:01:31,680
The markings.

5757
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,240
There's like shit all over the floor.

5758
03:01:33,400 --> 03:01:33,960
How am I supposed to get in?

5759
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:34,420
Help.

5760
03:01:34,980 --> 03:01:35,460
I see, I see.

5761
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:35,800
That's fine.

5762
03:01:36,080 --> 03:01:37,120
Oh nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!

5763
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:39,200
I can't mark him.

5764
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:40,660
He has too much like...

5765
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:41,440
Um...

5766
03:01:41,440 --> 03:01:41,960
What's it called?

5767
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:44,840
See like, when I mark him, it goes straight to the head.

5768
03:01:45,260 --> 03:01:46,260
So I can't change it.

5769
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:50,520
I don't know what he's doing when I'm leaving.

5770
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:51,200
Oh ho ho!

5771
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:53,680
I'm scared!

5772
03:01:54,720 --> 03:01:55,300
Mom, I'm scared!

5773
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:55,880
He's coalescing!

5774
03:01:56,260 --> 03:01:57,120
That's what he's doing, he's...

5775
03:01:57,120 --> 03:01:58,180
Mom, I'm scared!

5776
03:01:58,560 --> 03:01:59,100
Oh, get behind a pillar!

5777
03:01:59,220 --> 03:01:59,760
Get behind a pillar!

5778
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:00,140
Okay.

5779
03:02:01,560 --> 03:02:02,080
I think.

5780
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:04,080
I'm behind this?

5781
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:04,160
I'm behind something.

5782
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:05,200
Yup.

5783
03:02:05,560 --> 03:02:06,620
Yeah, do that.

5784
03:02:07,740 --> 03:02:08,640
Am I safe?

5785
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:09,520
I'm safe!

5786
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:10,480
Oh yeah!

5787
03:02:11,160 --> 03:02:11,800
Good stuff.

5788
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:13,660
Jindahad, I'm onto you!

5789
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:19,820
Oh my gosh, he's too far for me to do any damage right now.

5790
03:02:21,380 --> 03:02:22,500
Uh, big ground floor.

5791
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:23,360
Uh, hit.

5792
03:02:24,420 --> 03:02:25,080
There we go.

5793
03:02:30,470 --> 03:02:32,190
I'm like, way too fucking far.

5794
03:02:32,230 --> 03:02:32,330
Staggered?

5795
03:02:32,490 --> 03:02:33,990
Nice stagger, nice stagger, nice stagger.

5796
03:02:35,990 --> 03:02:36,510
He's down.

5797
03:02:37,330 --> 03:02:38,250
I have ult, I have ult!

5798
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:39,310
Do you have rewind?

5799
03:02:40,050 --> 03:02:41,250
No, I just use it for the stagger.

5800
03:02:41,350 --> 03:02:41,830
Okay, it's fine.

5801
03:02:42,070 --> 03:02:43,450
I'll just ult this, still.

5802
03:02:44,370 --> 03:02:45,330
Nice, I staggered again.

5803
03:02:56,870 --> 03:02:58,210
Okay, I'll try and get closer.

5804
03:03:00,350 --> 03:03:01,070
Oh lord.

5805
03:03:04,480 --> 03:03:05,500
Oh my god!

5806
03:03:05,960 --> 03:03:07,340
That looks like an of course.

5807
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:08,900
What does that do?

5808
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:10,100
What does that do?

5809
03:03:10,180 --> 03:03:10,560
I don't know.

5810
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:12,860
I think it's, I think it's a phase change.

5811
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:13,440
Okay.

5812
03:03:13,940 --> 03:03:14,260
Okay.

5813
03:03:16,540 --> 03:03:17,120
Jesus Christ!

5814
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:18,360
I don't know what a lot of these are.

5815
03:03:21,180 --> 03:03:23,200
Like, I don't know what any of these moves does.

5816
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:24,900
So I'm like, scared.

5817
03:03:24,900 --> 03:03:27,100
Okay, we have a hunt on the ground next to him.

5818
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:29,680
Wish I can like, mark him.

5819
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:31,640
Actually getting up time is kind of shitty.

5820
03:03:32,100 --> 03:03:32,380
Oh god.

5821
03:03:34,140 --> 03:03:36,980
Maybe that's where Archer Man shines because he can actually get some.

5822
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:39,740
Oh god.

5823
03:03:39,740 --> 03:03:42,900
It just sucks because I can't mark him at, like, mark him at a better location for you guys.

5824
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:44,300
I did not mean to double heal!

5825
03:03:44,480 --> 03:03:45,080
Oh, that sucks!

5826
03:03:45,280 --> 03:03:45,440
Okay.

5827
03:03:46,520 --> 03:03:47,580
Oh, we have to find a pillar.

5828
03:03:47,580 --> 03:03:48,020
Okay, he's doing the thing.

5829
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:49,560
Pillars, pillars, pillars.

5830
03:03:49,560 --> 03:03:50,500
Where's a pillar?

5831
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:51,140
Where's a pillar?

5832
03:03:51,300 --> 03:03:51,760
Where's a pillar?

5833
03:03:54,720 --> 03:03:56,020
I do not see one.

5834
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:57,940
Where's a pillar?

5835
03:04:00,900 --> 03:04:02,720
Where's that pillar come from?

5836
03:04:02,760 --> 03:04:03,980
What is that?

5837
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:07,780
I don't know what that is.

5838
03:04:07,780 --> 03:04:08,400
I'm just gonna leave.

5839
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:09,400
Me too.

5840
03:04:10,300 --> 03:04:10,900
I think we would've...

5841
03:04:10,900 --> 03:04:12,820
Oh, we would've died if we were in there, I think.

5842
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:13,720
Okay.

5843
03:04:14,140 --> 03:04:14,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5844
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:17,760
Oh, shit!

5845
03:04:18,080 --> 03:04:20,560
It sucks he did that right after I popped a fire thing.

5846
03:04:20,560 --> 03:04:20,880
Yeah.

5847
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:23,940
Oh, he's on you.

5848
03:04:24,940 --> 03:04:26,240
I'm gonna struggle a little bit.

5849
03:04:26,380 --> 03:04:27,280
I accidentally used two heals.

5850
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:27,860
I'm very sad.

5851
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:30,260
Oh, that's your struggle busting right now?

5852
03:04:32,340 --> 03:04:34,360
Yeah, my damage uptime is not great.

5853
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:38,060
Don't worry, I'm not having a great time either.

5854
03:04:38,340 --> 03:04:41,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

5855
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:46,580
I feel like my damage is so low.

5856
03:04:48,080 --> 03:04:48,960
It's not...

5857
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:49,940
It's hard to do damage.

5858
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:50,700
He's very tanky.

5859
03:04:50,940 --> 03:04:50,980
Yeah.

5860
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:51,940
It is.

5861
03:04:51,940 --> 03:04:52,620
I wouldn't worry too much.

5862
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:56,380
But I don't think I'm doing much damage.

5863
03:04:57,080 --> 03:04:57,220
Okay.

5864
03:04:57,880 --> 03:04:59,420
I mean, I'm doing 51 per hit.

5865
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:00,740
And then he fucking leaves.

5866
03:05:00,740 --> 03:05:02,460
He just goes across the entire arena.

5867
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:06,580
Oh, Jesus.

5868
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:07,700
Fucker.

5869
03:05:09,880 --> 03:05:10,460
I have ult.

5870
03:05:10,660 --> 03:05:11,400
I'm just gonna ult this.

5871
03:05:12,940 --> 03:05:14,500
And then sometimes when I actually get to him...

5872
03:05:14,500 --> 03:05:14,540
Yeah, I got him.

5873
03:05:14,540 --> 03:05:14,800
I hit him.

5874
03:05:15,140 --> 03:05:15,420
I hit him.

5875
03:05:15,660 --> 03:05:16,000
Nice.

5876
03:05:16,940 --> 03:05:18,700
Sometimes when I actually do get to him, he just...

5877
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:20,360
AOE's the floor.

5878
03:05:20,580 --> 03:05:21,300
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5879
03:05:27,490 --> 03:05:27,850
Jesus.

5880
03:05:27,850 --> 03:05:28,810
Okay, what's this one?

5881
03:05:31,250 --> 03:05:31,610
Shit.

5882
03:05:34,410 --> 03:05:34,770
Uh...

5883
03:05:34,770 --> 03:05:35,850
He's behind me, I think.

5884
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:36,650
He's over there.

5885
03:05:36,750 --> 03:05:37,530
Oh, he's doing that...

5886
03:05:37,530 --> 03:05:38,870
Oh, he's doing that freezing circle again.

5887
03:05:39,250 --> 03:05:39,850
We just have to run.

5888
03:05:39,850 --> 03:05:40,670
I'm going.

5889
03:05:42,790 --> 03:05:43,730
I think we make...

5890
03:05:43,730 --> 03:05:46,830
It's either in the center or we run far, I think.

5891
03:05:49,430 --> 03:05:49,910
Uh...

5892
03:05:49,910 --> 03:05:50,630
This isn't huge, right?

5893
03:05:50,630 --> 03:05:50,730
Oh, shoot.

5894
03:05:50,990 --> 03:05:51,490
Oh, God.

5895
03:05:51,830 --> 03:05:52,970
I think we're fine, we're fine.

5896
03:05:53,310 --> 03:05:55,830
We have to either go to the center or back there.

5897
03:05:56,370 --> 03:05:58,110
He's so tanky.

5898
03:06:00,530 --> 03:06:01,790
Oh my God, that hit me.

5899
03:06:03,610 --> 03:06:05,370
I marked him though, but...

5900
03:06:05,370 --> 03:06:05,410
Yeah.

5901
03:06:06,490 --> 03:06:07,590
I only have two flasks left.

5902
03:06:13,900 --> 03:06:14,920
Oh my God, I'm one.

5903
03:06:15,540 --> 03:06:16,760
I have only one flask left.

5904
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:18,720
I'm stuck under his tail!

5905
03:06:18,880 --> 03:06:19,900
Stuck under his tail!

5906
03:06:20,180 --> 03:06:20,700
Oh, no!

5907
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:22,200
Oh, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine!

5908
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:24,280
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

5909
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:25,340
Uh-oh.

5910
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:26,660
He's doing something.

5911
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:27,980
What's that?

5912
03:06:28,980 --> 03:06:29,360
Phase three?

5913
03:06:29,360 --> 03:06:30,320
My last flask.

5914
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:31,100
Flask, flask.

5915
03:06:31,240 --> 03:06:32,160
No more flask for me.

5916
03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:32,920
Last flask for me too.

5917
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:37,340
I'm doing 30 damage, by the way.

5918
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:42,800
Nice, nice, nice.

5919
03:06:43,020 --> 03:06:44,140
I'm getting his head, I'm getting his head.

5920
03:06:44,260 --> 03:06:44,740
If I can.

5921
03:06:45,140 --> 03:06:45,420
Me too.

5922
03:06:45,660 --> 03:06:46,000
You got him?

5923
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:46,520
Nice.

5924
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:49,560
I got him.

5925
03:06:54,310 --> 03:06:55,770
God, it's not like...

5926
03:06:55,770 --> 03:06:56,430
It's not.

5927
03:06:56,750 --> 03:06:57,350
He's doing it again!

5928
03:06:58,010 --> 03:06:58,590
Where is he?

5929
03:06:58,690 --> 03:06:59,650
Okay, what is it this time?

5930
03:07:04,070 --> 03:07:04,770
Where is he?

5931
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:07,930
Oh, we're on the edge of the arena.

5932
03:07:08,090 --> 03:07:08,930
Okay, he's way over there.

5933
03:07:10,170 --> 03:07:10,750
Wait, where?

5934
03:07:11,610 --> 03:07:12,990
Oh, okay, we're fine.

5935
03:07:13,210 --> 03:07:14,790
Yeah, just stay way the fuck away.

5936
03:07:16,170 --> 03:07:16,530
Okay.

5937
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:23,580
Guys, it's so hard to get close to him because his...

5938
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:25,760
I'm an archer, so my...

5939
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:28,460
It's even scarier for me to get too close.

5940
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:31,760
I don't know, there's icicles all over the floor in melee.

5941
03:07:31,900 --> 03:07:31,980
Yeah.

5942
03:07:32,080 --> 03:07:34,320
He's just like very area denial in general, I think.

5943
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:34,800
Yeah.

5944
03:07:35,720 --> 03:07:40,760
Like, I have to be really close to do more, but it's so difficult for this guy.

5945
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:44,020
And I can't shoot the head because his head is so fucking tiny.

5946
03:07:45,380 --> 03:07:46,260
Oh my god!

5947
03:07:46,380 --> 03:07:47,260
I'm sorry, you're right!

5948
03:07:47,380 --> 03:07:48,300
I mean, that should be closer!

5949
03:07:49,160 --> 03:07:50,980
I'm sorry, sir, your head is huge!

5950
03:07:53,100 --> 03:07:53,660
Oh shit.

5951
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:55,380
I got frostbite, I got frostbite.

5952
03:07:56,340 --> 03:07:57,620
But I could have ult soon.

5953
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:01,800
Okay.

5954
03:08:02,300 --> 03:08:03,280
I've ulted in one.

5955
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:04,360
One more hit.

5956
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:04,800
I got ult.

5957
03:08:04,980 --> 03:08:05,420
I'm ulting.

5958
03:08:05,900 --> 03:08:06,980
I have my ultimate.

5959
03:08:07,620 --> 03:08:08,240
I got it!

5960
03:08:08,400 --> 03:08:09,620
I hit him, I hit him!

5961
03:08:14,070 --> 03:08:14,770
Nice ult, nice ult!

5962
03:08:19,960 --> 03:08:21,000
Getting out, getting out.

5963
03:08:24,980 --> 03:08:27,940
I shoot his legs because it's like the fattest thing I can shoot.

5964
03:08:33,050 --> 03:08:34,490
Oh my god, I'm one HP.

5965
03:08:35,970 --> 03:08:36,970
You got this, Doki.

5966
03:08:37,910 --> 03:08:38,790
I'm one HP.

5967
03:08:39,190 --> 03:08:39,430
Deal.

5968
03:08:39,890 --> 03:08:40,890
I don't have heals.

5969
03:08:41,370 --> 03:08:42,330
Watch the explosions.

5970
03:08:42,810 --> 03:08:43,810
I think, yep, those are gonna pop.

5971
03:08:50,390 --> 03:08:50,830
Alright.

5972
03:08:51,570 --> 03:08:53,610
Living the dream of the one HP.

5973
03:08:53,990 --> 03:08:54,210
That's good.

5974
03:08:54,610 --> 03:08:54,730
Come on.

5975
03:08:54,730 --> 03:08:55,750
You just be brave, Doki.

5976
03:08:55,870 --> 03:08:56,510
I believe in you.

5977
03:08:56,690 --> 03:08:58,030
The one HP dream!

5978
03:09:00,750 --> 03:09:02,750
I don't see what's bad and what's good.

5979
03:09:02,770 --> 03:09:03,110
Goodbye!

5980
03:09:04,130 --> 03:09:05,150
I'm coming for you.

5981
03:09:05,650 --> 03:09:06,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5982
03:09:06,130 --> 03:09:07,410
I'm gonna stealth so he doesn't try and hit me.

5983
03:09:08,330 --> 03:09:08,890
Careful, Zen.

5984
03:09:08,910 --> 03:09:10,010
I'll be on you for a second.

5985
03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:10,130
I'll be on you for a second.

5986
03:09:11,130 --> 03:09:12,890
That's fine, Zen has passive heal, remember?

5987
03:09:13,310 --> 03:09:13,990
Passive regen?

5988
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:15,130
Yep.

5989
03:09:15,630 --> 03:09:16,510
Wait, I'm right here.

5990
03:09:17,490 --> 03:09:18,490
I know, but...

5991
03:09:18,490 --> 03:09:19,430
No, these are dangerous.

5992
03:09:19,610 --> 03:09:20,970
If I touch these, I get more frostbite.

5993
03:09:21,670 --> 03:09:22,110
Yeah, yeah.

5994
03:09:22,750 --> 03:09:23,450
Wait, Zen got knocked!

5995
03:09:23,570 --> 03:09:23,950
Zen got knocked!

5996
03:09:24,690 --> 03:09:25,070
It's okay.

5997
03:09:25,550 --> 03:09:25,910
We got it.

5998
03:09:26,750 --> 03:09:26,950
Okay.

5999
03:09:27,930 --> 03:09:28,470
I'm heading over.

6000
03:09:28,990 --> 03:09:29,290
I'll head over.

6001
03:09:29,410 --> 03:09:29,750
I'll head over.

6002
03:09:30,250 --> 03:09:30,770
Find your run.

6003
03:09:31,050 --> 03:09:31,390
Come on.

6004
03:09:31,590 --> 03:09:32,370
We got this.

6005
03:09:34,470 --> 03:09:35,170
I'm having to back up.

6006
03:09:35,270 --> 03:09:35,890
It's doing an AoE.

6007
03:09:36,490 --> 03:09:37,650
Got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

6008
03:09:41,090 --> 03:09:41,850
Zen up, Zen up.

6009
03:09:42,090 --> 03:09:43,110
Yeah, yeah, I got her, I got her.

6010
03:09:47,880 --> 03:09:49,000
Oh my god.

6011
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:49,900
Oh, get him!

6012
03:09:52,080 --> 03:09:52,960
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

6013
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:55,020
Good hit, good hit.

6014
03:09:56,320 --> 03:09:56,620
Rewound.

6015
03:09:58,260 --> 03:09:59,100
Come on, baby.

6016
03:09:59,460 --> 03:09:59,740
Let's go.

6017
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:00,600
She's so low!

6018
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:05,780
You're gonna blow up his ass!

6019
03:10:06,820 --> 03:10:08,420
I'm gonna shoot his legs, I'm gonna shoot his legs.

6020
03:10:12,160 --> 03:10:13,440
Oh, where's he going?

6021
03:10:13,800 --> 03:10:14,780
What's he doing?

6022
03:10:14,960 --> 03:10:15,280
No!

6023
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:16,780
He's FISH!

6024
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:17,640
He's cheesy!

6025
03:10:20,240 --> 03:10:21,000
Oh my god, it's me!

6026
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:21,620
It's me!

6027
03:10:21,640 --> 03:10:22,200
Oh my god, it's me!

6028
03:10:22,600 --> 03:10:23,540
Oh my god, it's me!

6029
03:10:23,540 --> 03:10:24,300
Oh my god, it's me!

6030
03:10:24,300 --> 03:10:24,400
Oh my god!

6031
03:10:24,400 --> 03:10:25,060
Why me?

6032
03:10:26,400 --> 03:10:27,100
Come on.

6033
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:28,120
Oh!

6034
03:10:30,780 --> 03:10:31,980
Okay, he's back there.

6035
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:33,280
Okay, now it's at live.

6036
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:33,880
Thank god.

6037
03:10:34,320 --> 03:10:34,900
Thank god.

6038
03:10:35,280 --> 03:10:36,700
I have one more, I can ult this.

6039
03:10:36,700 --> 03:10:38,640
I just need to hit, like, a couple more strides.

6040
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:38,940
Okay.

6041
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:41,580
He needs to get closer, and I can...

6042
03:10:41,580 --> 03:10:42,600
Oh, I got dropped!

6043
03:10:42,860 --> 03:10:43,100
Oh no.

6044
03:10:43,420 --> 03:10:44,220
Can you tap me?

6045
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:45,040
Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

6046
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:45,540
I'm only on one.

6047
03:10:45,560 --> 03:10:45,840
Come on.

6048
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:46,240
Yeah.

6049
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:47,700
I got her, I got her, I got her, I got her.

6050
03:10:48,140 --> 03:10:48,640
Thank you.

6051
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:52,060
Get him, Zed!

6052
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:53,280
Get him, Zed!

6053
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:53,340
Get him, Zed!

6054
03:10:53,340 --> 03:10:54,700
Get him, Zed!

6055
03:10:54,700 --> 03:10:55,640
Rewinding!

6056
03:10:56,020 --> 03:10:57,340
Ult it, ult it!

6057
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:57,740
Ult it!

6058
03:10:57,740 --> 03:10:57,780
Ult it!

6059
03:10:57,880 --> 03:10:58,540
Yes!

6060
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:00,120
The killing flow!

6061
03:11:01,420 --> 03:11:02,180
Yes!

6062
03:11:02,520 --> 03:11:03,760
Oh my god.

6063
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:05,640
We got the killing flow!

6064
03:11:09,540 --> 03:11:09,920
Yes!

6065
03:11:11,580 --> 03:11:13,800
Oh my god, we did it!

6066
03:11:15,420 --> 03:11:16,320
Oh my god.

6067
03:11:16,700 --> 03:11:17,360
Yes!

6068
03:11:19,480 --> 03:11:20,760
Oh my god.

6069
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:22,120
Okay.

6070
03:11:22,640 --> 03:11:24,240
That shit was crazy.

6071
03:11:24,940 --> 03:11:26,460
Oh my god.

6072
03:11:26,460 --> 03:11:28,420
That took you with the kill steal.

6073
03:11:28,840 --> 03:11:29,180
I...

6074
03:11:29,180 --> 03:11:30,500
What can I do?

6075
03:11:30,920 --> 03:11:31,300
My heart.

6076
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:33,460
I just have a bow!

6077
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:39,940
Oh man, oh man.

6078
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:42,900
My physical mark is...

6079
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:44,800
That fucking tiny ass head!

6080
03:11:48,400 --> 03:11:49,380
Oh, you...

6081
03:11:49,380 --> 03:11:50,880
Oh, we unlocked, like, clothes now.

6082
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,260
Now we can customize our clothes.

6083
03:11:52,560 --> 03:11:52,580
Oh.

6084
03:11:52,980 --> 03:11:53,380
Hello.

6085
03:11:54,240 --> 03:11:54,540
Nice!

6086
03:11:55,860 --> 03:11:56,660
Oh, nice!

6087
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:57,120
Sweet!

6088
03:11:57,500 --> 03:11:57,940
Sweet!

6089
03:11:58,820 --> 03:12:00,240
Where the fuck is my dressing?

6090
03:12:00,640 --> 03:12:00,960
Oh my god.

6091
03:12:01,180 --> 03:12:03,040
I'm going to guess we don't show that though.

6092
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:04,280
Show what?

6093
03:12:07,180 --> 03:12:09,180
Oh my god, we have drip now.

6094
03:12:09,360 --> 03:12:09,860
Look at that.

6095
03:12:10,420 --> 03:12:10,680
Oh, the thing.

6096
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:11,300
Where's my drip?

6097
03:12:11,400 --> 03:12:12,020
I want my drip.

6098
03:12:12,420 --> 03:12:13,440
It's in their closet.

6099
03:12:13,780 --> 03:12:13,980
Which...

6100
03:12:13,980 --> 03:12:15,200
It's like the dressing room.

6101
03:12:15,320 --> 03:12:15,460
Which is the storage room.

6102
03:12:15,640 --> 03:12:16,120
Oh, I see it.

6103
03:12:16,120 --> 03:12:17,320
Oh, you see like the mirror thing?

6104
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:19,220
Yeah, I see where I go.

6105
03:12:19,320 --> 03:12:19,980
I don't have money.

6106
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:21,240
Benda, are you still here?

6107
03:12:22,340 --> 03:12:23,280
We did it!

6108
03:12:23,780 --> 03:12:24,120
Benda!

6109
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:24,560
Benda!

6110
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:25,540
With some currency.

6111
03:12:25,540 --> 03:12:26,260
With some drip.

6112
03:12:26,260 --> 03:12:26,540
No.

6113
03:12:26,740 --> 03:12:29,180
You know, I won't tell anyone if my...

6114
03:12:29,180 --> 03:12:29,420
Ooh.

6115
03:12:29,460 --> 03:12:34,060
If I suddenly have $35,000, I won't tell anyone.

6116
03:12:34,560 --> 03:12:36,660
I can basically become a Bloodborne character.

6117
03:12:36,900 --> 03:12:38,100
Oh my god.

6118
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:38,240
Oh my god.

6119
03:12:38,300 --> 03:12:39,240
That's so hot.

6120
03:12:39,580 --> 03:12:40,220
That's so hot.

6121
03:12:40,220 --> 03:12:41,240
Alright, time to save.

6122
03:12:41,460 --> 03:12:41,640
You get to be...

6123
03:12:41,640 --> 03:12:43,880
Oh my god, you can be a Bloodborne character.

6124
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:47,800
Oh, I think Bandai...

6125
03:12:47,800 --> 03:12:49,920
A hunter is a hunter, even in a dream.

6126
03:12:51,460 --> 03:12:53,340
No, I don't have enough money.

6127
03:12:53,700 --> 03:12:54,760
He looks so cool.

6128
03:12:55,880 --> 03:12:57,840
Oh yeah, there's one that looks like Robin Hood.

6129
03:12:58,460 --> 03:13:00,360
Oh, we can showcase the thing.

6130
03:13:01,020 --> 03:13:01,280
Tweet.

6131
03:13:01,480 --> 03:13:03,200
Oh, I already went and looked.

6132
03:13:03,400 --> 03:13:03,780
My bad.

6133
03:13:03,940 --> 03:13:04,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

6134
03:13:04,900 --> 03:13:06,780
I saw dressing room.

6135
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:07,700
Make with us there.

6136
03:13:07,980 --> 03:13:09,220
I'm sorry, Bandai...

6137
03:13:09,220 --> 03:13:11,080
That's why Bandai disappeared.

6138
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:11,740
I'm sorry.

6139
03:13:13,860 --> 03:13:14,880
I'm sorry.

6140
03:13:15,280 --> 03:13:16,120
I didn't...

6141
03:13:16,120 --> 03:13:17,060
I was so excited.

6142
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:17,840
We were just so excited.

6143
03:13:18,160 --> 03:13:19,260
I'm so excited.

6144
03:13:19,300 --> 03:13:20,100
I'm sorry.

6145
03:13:20,580 --> 03:13:20,820
Please.

6146
03:13:21,220 --> 03:13:22,280
They said we can sew.

6147
03:13:22,580 --> 03:13:22,980
Oh, we can?

6148
03:13:23,300 --> 03:13:24,260
Oh yeah, we're fine.

6149
03:13:24,360 --> 03:13:25,120
Yeah, we're fine.

6150
03:13:25,460 --> 03:13:26,280
We're so fine.

6151
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:28,360
Oh, that's cool.

6152
03:13:29,160 --> 03:13:29,580
Yay!

6153
03:13:30,700 --> 03:13:31,000
Yay!

6154
03:13:31,440 --> 03:13:32,080
I'm going back.

6155
03:13:34,200 --> 03:13:36,800
Wait, where's my dressing room?

6156
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:37,580
Oh, it's over here.

6157
03:13:38,400 --> 03:13:39,120
They actually...

6158
03:13:39,120 --> 03:13:41,600
They went in and physically removed it real quick while we were distracted.

6159
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:41,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6160
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:42,980
Because we weren't supposed to show it.

6161
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:43,740
Oh my god.

6162
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:44,580
It's Joel.

6163
03:13:46,020 --> 03:13:47,680
Oh, the Revenant one.

6164
03:13:48,820 --> 03:13:50,320
People are going to be like, not...

6165
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:52,880
The Revenant clothes, they give our shoes.

6166
03:13:53,100 --> 03:13:54,380
So I don't think people would like that.

6167
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:55,540
Oh wait, no.

6168
03:13:55,580 --> 03:13:55,960
This one.

6169
03:13:56,180 --> 03:13:57,180
No, actually this one.

6170
03:13:57,300 --> 03:13:57,900
It took it.

6171
03:13:58,680 --> 03:13:59,460
Oh, never mind.

6172
03:13:59,560 --> 03:14:00,060
No, never mind.

6173
03:14:00,140 --> 03:14:01,180
Just covers it up more.

6174
03:14:01,180 --> 03:14:01,820
Holy heck.

6175
03:14:02,260 --> 03:14:02,480
Man.

6176
03:14:02,980 --> 03:14:03,600
There's still feet.

6177
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:08,460
Oh, the Recluse one.

6178
03:14:08,620 --> 03:14:09,860
The last one looks like the...

6179
03:14:09,860 --> 03:14:10,040
So who survived?

6180
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:11,440
Um, the Elden Ring woman.

6181
03:14:13,560 --> 03:14:14,860
Let me go look at the stream.

6182
03:14:15,080 --> 03:14:16,140
They'll be probably in highlights, I think.

6183
03:14:17,380 --> 03:14:17,780
Oh.

6184
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:20,980
The Garden has a cool one because they changed it to a crow.

6185
03:14:24,330 --> 03:14:25,290
Oh, are they still...

6186
03:14:25,290 --> 03:14:26,150
Are people still doing it?

6187
03:14:26,290 --> 03:14:27,270
It looks like they're still doing it.

6188
03:14:27,270 --> 03:14:28,870
Not enough as the last boss we fought.

6189
03:14:29,030 --> 03:14:30,450
Yeah, that one was easy.

6190
03:14:30,570 --> 03:14:31,310
I think we're...

6191
03:14:31,310 --> 03:14:32,430
Super under level too.

6192
03:14:33,470 --> 03:14:33,490
They still have two people on it.

6193
03:14:33,530 --> 03:14:34,390
I think we were just...

6194
03:14:34,390 --> 03:14:35,650
Team Green and Team Violet still going.

6195
03:14:36,030 --> 03:14:36,610
We were so...

6196
03:14:36,610 --> 03:14:37,810
We were just really under level.

6197
03:14:38,030 --> 03:14:39,050
We were the second boss.

6198
03:14:42,350 --> 03:14:44,810
Wait, did anyone got wiped yet for the third one?

6199
03:14:45,070 --> 03:14:46,130
Did anyone else got wiped?

6200
03:14:46,250 --> 03:14:47,310
Or was it just...

6201
03:14:47,310 --> 03:14:48,590
Or did everyone got through?

6202
03:14:48,710 --> 03:14:49,750
There's two teams still fighting it.

6203
03:14:49,770 --> 03:14:50,590
I don't know if anybody died.

6204
03:14:53,430 --> 03:14:56,670
Bro, I felt like I was doing like pepper damage until the end.

6205
03:14:56,670 --> 03:14:57,970
Like I feel like the only da...

6206
03:14:57,970 --> 03:15:00,370
I knew I was doing damage because I had ult like three times.

6207
03:15:01,250 --> 03:15:01,630
So...

6208
03:15:01,630 --> 03:15:02,550
Because I can...

6209
03:15:02,550 --> 03:15:03,310
You can only da...

6210
03:15:03,310 --> 03:15:04,870
Like you only get ult when you do damage.

6211
03:15:05,070 --> 03:15:06,670
So like I was doing some form of damage.

6212
03:15:09,330 --> 03:15:10,690
This is the last round guys.

6213
03:15:11,550 --> 03:15:12,130
Oh shit.

6214
03:15:12,650 --> 03:15:13,570
That was the last one.

6215
03:15:13,670 --> 03:15:14,210
I had fun!

6216
03:15:14,490 --> 03:15:14,970
Yeah, it was.

6217
03:15:15,230 --> 03:15:16,070
Yeah, me too.

6218
03:15:16,630 --> 03:15:17,010
Yeah.

6219
03:15:17,010 --> 03:15:19,150
I'm looking forward to like new life-ing this a little bit.

6220
03:15:20,550 --> 03:15:20,990
I'm down.

6221
03:15:21,830 --> 03:15:25,330
If any of you guys want to play more when it launches, I'm down for more.

6222
03:15:25,330 --> 03:15:26,130
Hell yeah.

6223
03:15:26,530 --> 03:15:28,010
I'm so ready for more of this.

6224
03:15:28,230 --> 03:15:28,430
Yeah.

6225
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:29,270
Yes, please.

6226
03:15:30,010 --> 03:15:30,850
Oh, green just wiped.

6227
03:15:32,250 --> 03:15:33,030
Not us!

6228
03:15:35,950 --> 03:15:37,330
It's the little things.

6229
03:15:37,390 --> 03:15:38,250
It wasn't us.

6230
03:15:39,950 --> 03:15:40,950
I don't know.

6231
03:15:41,070 --> 03:15:42,810
But I found that really easy.

6232
03:15:43,310 --> 03:15:44,930
That one was easier than the goat.

6233
03:15:44,930 --> 03:15:48,730
Zen out here with her double blasphemous blades that were donated by her teammates.

6234
03:15:49,050 --> 03:15:49,110
Okay, to be fair.

6235
03:15:49,110 --> 03:15:50,310
Like, oh, that's so easy.

6236
03:15:51,030 --> 03:15:54,950
Also like, we, we like basically warded you up, Zen.

6237
03:15:57,390 --> 03:16:02,790
Me and Lamu gave us, gave you both our gold weapons and roided you up to fight that guy.

6238
03:16:04,730 --> 03:16:09,290
Zen out here with regen fire damage, double blasphemous blades.

6239
03:16:09,550 --> 03:16:10,370
Oh, so easy.

6240
03:16:11,350 --> 03:16:14,250
And now I'm here like shooting toothpicks at the dragon.

6241
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:16,390
And I'm like, pew pew, pew pew.

6242
03:16:18,230 --> 03:16:21,330
And then my chat was like, get closer, Doki.

6243
03:16:21,430 --> 03:16:22,970
I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

6244
03:16:23,150 --> 03:16:27,310
Let me get closer to ice damage with no flask.

6245
03:16:27,610 --> 03:16:33,630
Let me, let me get closer to the dragon blowing ice on the floor with no regen.

6246
03:16:35,150 --> 03:16:37,070
Oh, it's gonna be a wipe.

6247
03:16:37,350 --> 03:16:38,230
Oh, no.

6248
03:16:38,930 --> 03:16:43,810
Guys, the reason you saw Zen so close to the dragon was because she had regen.

6249
03:16:44,570 --> 03:16:45,310
That might be a wipe.

6250
03:16:49,290 --> 03:16:51,550
Yeah, I was so crazy with it.

6251
03:16:52,670 --> 03:16:53,010
Yeah.

6252
03:16:54,070 --> 03:16:55,670
You can do it, Team Violet.

6253
03:16:57,250 --> 03:16:57,770
Oh.

6254
03:16:58,410 --> 03:17:00,810
I made it look so freaking easy on Gon.

6255
03:17:01,330 --> 03:17:02,490
Wait, no, they had a rez.

6256
03:17:02,490 --> 03:17:03,770
Oh, they had the free rez.

6257
03:17:04,030 --> 03:17:05,410
Oh, was it the...

6258
03:17:05,970 --> 03:17:07,410
Did they have a revenant?

6259
03:17:08,590 --> 03:17:09,730
No, it was the...

6260
03:17:09,730 --> 03:17:12,450
You can get a thing that's like, you revive once upon death.

6261
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:14,470
Nice.

6262
03:17:14,990 --> 03:17:16,130
Yeah, that's what I had.

6263
03:17:16,470 --> 03:17:17,010
Clutching it, clutching it, clutching it.

6264
03:17:20,090 --> 03:17:21,430
This might be the one.

6265
03:17:21,870 --> 03:17:22,550
Come on.

6266
03:17:22,810 --> 03:17:23,050
Whoa.

6267
03:17:23,790 --> 03:17:24,650
I'm just chilling.

6268
03:17:24,810 --> 03:17:25,590
He can do it.

6269
03:17:25,670 --> 03:17:26,170
I believe.

6270
03:17:26,450 --> 03:17:27,690
Is it one guy left?

6271
03:17:28,230 --> 03:17:28,850
Oh, shit.

6272
03:17:28,850 --> 03:17:30,010
I forgot to pick up my meds today.

6273
03:17:30,730 --> 03:17:31,050
Nice.

6274
03:17:31,770 --> 03:17:31,810
Okay.

6275
03:17:31,810 --> 03:17:33,430
Is it just one guy left in that?

6276
03:17:33,610 --> 03:17:34,530
In the...

6277
03:17:34,530 --> 03:17:35,550
In the last fight?

6278
03:17:37,130 --> 03:17:37,490
It's...

6279
03:17:37,490 --> 03:17:37,850
Yeah.

6280
03:17:38,410 --> 03:17:39,210
No, Raiditz.

6281
03:17:39,370 --> 03:17:40,130
Which, which...

6282
03:17:40,130 --> 03:17:40,790
Oh, shit.

6283
03:17:41,190 --> 03:17:45,870
Raiditz is alive and is kind of like chain wiping because of how big his attacks are.

6284
03:17:46,630 --> 03:17:46,770
Oh.

6285
03:17:47,070 --> 03:17:49,930
Like once you have to stop and actually start trying to rez, it's a pain in the ass.

6286
03:17:50,690 --> 03:17:51,070
Oh, no.

6287
03:17:59,150 --> 03:18:00,090
Hit it up for day two.

6288
03:18:00,270 --> 03:18:00,870
No thyroxine.

6289
03:18:01,050 --> 03:18:01,450
That was stupid.

6290
03:18:01,450 --> 03:18:01,890
I was so...

6291
03:18:01,890 --> 03:18:04,070
I was so all consumed by doing this.

6292
03:18:04,210 --> 03:18:04,310
They might be able to.

6293
03:18:05,330 --> 03:18:05,670
Yeah.

6294
03:18:05,970 --> 03:18:08,110
We were so tired yesterday, guys.

6295
03:18:08,850 --> 03:18:09,130
Yeah.

6296
03:18:09,510 --> 03:18:10,470
We were so tired.

6297
03:18:10,690 --> 03:18:11,070
Some...

6298
03:18:11,070 --> 03:18:13,090
Like a lot of teams know what's up on the second.

6299
03:18:13,390 --> 03:18:13,690
Like...

6300
03:18:13,690 --> 03:18:14,230
What was it?

6301
03:18:14,330 --> 03:18:15,170
Some of the bosses.

6302
03:18:15,610 --> 03:18:16,430
And then...

6303
03:18:16,430 --> 03:18:19,070
We were just happy we beat the first boss yesterday.

6304
03:18:19,870 --> 03:18:20,730
Oh my god.

6305
03:18:23,250 --> 03:18:28,890
I like how they were like, we're done with the staring at the crawling around on the ground cam and put all three in again.

6306
03:18:32,310 --> 03:18:34,710
Oh my god, Lyme was off her meds.

6307
03:18:35,630 --> 03:18:35,930
Yeah.

6308
03:18:36,710 --> 03:18:37,230
It's okay.

6309
03:18:37,330 --> 03:18:40,330
It usually takes about seven days for them to fully like actually disappear.

6310
03:18:40,630 --> 03:18:40,930
So...

6311
03:18:40,930 --> 03:18:41,450
It's okay.

6312
03:18:41,450 --> 03:18:42,730
I'll just be more...

6313
03:18:42,730 --> 03:18:43,570
A little bit more tired.

6314
03:18:44,610 --> 03:18:44,730
Yeah.

6315
03:18:45,210 --> 03:18:45,410
Wait.

6316
03:18:45,750 --> 03:18:47,330
Does that mean we're going to disappear?

6317
03:18:48,030 --> 03:18:48,370
Oh, no.

6318
03:18:48,670 --> 03:18:49,010
Okay.

6319
03:18:49,370 --> 03:18:49,910
No, no.

6320
03:18:49,990 --> 03:18:51,750
When I'm off my meds, you get stronger.

6321
03:18:52,270 --> 03:18:52,650
No, no.

6322
03:18:52,910 --> 03:18:53,230
When...

6323
03:18:53,230 --> 03:18:53,690
No, yeah.

6324
03:18:53,870 --> 03:18:54,470
Like when she...

6325
03:18:54,470 --> 03:18:56,270
She's on her meds right now, so she sees us.

6326
03:18:56,350 --> 03:18:57,710
When she's off her meds, we disappear.

6327
03:18:58,890 --> 03:18:59,950
Oh, that was such a bitch.

6328
03:19:00,090 --> 03:19:00,790
It was a good idea.

6329
03:19:00,890 --> 03:19:02,930
He tried to use his ult to res them like an AoE.

6330
03:19:03,190 --> 03:19:03,390
Yeah.

6331
03:19:03,550 --> 03:19:04,290
But then like...

6332
03:19:04,290 --> 03:19:08,610
Because his hitbox is so big as the dog, he just hit all the ice and immediately got kicked out of his ult.

6333
03:19:10,110 --> 03:19:10,430
Oh...

6334
03:19:10,950 --> 03:19:11,590
That sucked.

6335
03:19:14,150 --> 03:19:15,710
Oh, I never used my weapon art.

6336
03:19:15,910 --> 03:19:17,150
I didn't even realize I had one.

6337
03:19:17,510 --> 03:19:18,030
All three of them are off.

6338
03:19:18,030 --> 03:19:19,170
Four of fives and clutch.

6339
03:19:19,330 --> 03:19:19,550
Are they...

6340
03:19:19,550 --> 03:19:21,090
They could be clutching this one.

6341
03:19:21,930 --> 03:19:23,710
I keep forgetting I had a weapon art.

6342
03:19:27,870 --> 03:19:29,610
They can't go down again, though.

6343
03:19:33,940 --> 03:19:35,120
They are so close.

6344
03:19:35,280 --> 03:19:35,760
Come on, guys.

6345
03:19:35,880 --> 03:19:36,440
You can clutch it.

6346
03:19:37,040 --> 03:19:38,720
Oh, the stagger, the stagger.

6347
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:39,200
Whoa.

6348
03:19:39,200 --> 03:19:42,120
Can I just say that the music for the final boss was so epic?

6349
03:19:42,120 --> 03:19:42,540
Oh, yeah.

6350
03:19:42,680 --> 03:19:43,900
No, the music was really cool.

6351
03:19:44,180 --> 03:19:44,780
I liked the music.

6352
03:19:45,120 --> 03:19:46,520
I'm not sure I heard it the entire time.

6353
03:19:46,660 --> 03:19:49,800
Like, I was so concentrated just trying to tell you what it was.

6354
03:19:51,060 --> 03:19:52,500
What team comp are they running?

6355
03:19:52,500 --> 03:19:52,540
How many?

6356
03:19:53,400 --> 03:19:53,540
Ouch.

6357
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:54,360
Wait.

6358
03:19:54,960 --> 03:19:55,180
Hold up.

6359
03:19:55,460 --> 03:19:59,680
One hunter dude, one zen class, and one dog man.

6360
03:20:00,540 --> 03:20:00,800
Oh, no.

6361
03:20:01,220 --> 03:20:02,340
We're back to where we were.

6362
03:20:02,520 --> 03:20:02,920
Hunter.

6363
03:20:04,340 --> 03:20:04,900
Alright.

6364
03:20:05,240 --> 03:20:06,020
Let me check.

6365
03:20:06,840 --> 03:20:09,800
Guys, we're just watching the event right now.

6366
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:10,060
Alright.

6367
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:11,400
Oh, no.

6368
03:20:11,420 --> 03:20:11,640
Wait.

6369
03:20:12,320 --> 03:20:13,780
No, they're done.

6370
03:20:14,220 --> 03:20:14,640
Oh, no.

6371
03:20:15,100 --> 03:20:15,680
No, there's one more.

6372
03:20:15,720 --> 03:20:16,380
No, he's still alive.

6373
03:20:16,460 --> 03:20:17,120
There's still one more.

6374
03:20:17,400 --> 03:20:17,520
No.

6375
03:20:18,040 --> 03:20:18,720
Oh, am I behind?

6376
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:19,480
They're done.

6377
03:20:21,900 --> 03:20:22,860
It was a good try.

6378
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:24,520
It was a good try.

6379
03:20:25,360 --> 03:20:26,980
Dude, how did they get to level 14?

6380
03:20:27,540 --> 03:20:28,040
How did they?

6381
03:20:28,840 --> 03:20:30,740
I think it's the routes.

6382
03:20:31,140 --> 03:20:31,800
It's rigged.

6383
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:32,420
Rigged.

6384
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:33,340
We just don't know our routes.

6385
03:20:33,480 --> 03:20:34,380
I mean, look at their routes.

6386
03:20:34,820 --> 03:20:36,680
It looks like they know exactly where to go.

6387
03:20:37,220 --> 03:20:38,500
I mean, look at their maps.

6388
03:20:38,500 --> 03:20:40,680
They were very confident.

6389
03:20:42,960 --> 03:20:45,080
Like, I was busy all day doing dog training and stuff.

6390
03:20:45,180 --> 03:20:47,320
And every now and again, the channel would go, can anyone do a run with me?

6391
03:20:47,380 --> 03:20:48,760
And I'm like, should I have done more runs?

6392
03:20:49,240 --> 03:20:51,540
Yeah, people were like looking for runs and stuff.

6393
03:20:51,820 --> 03:20:54,360
Okay, we were able to defeat the dragon guy at level 12.

6394
03:20:54,840 --> 03:20:55,880
That's all I'm saying.

6395
03:20:58,060 --> 03:20:59,840
We did it at level 12.

6396
03:21:00,680 --> 03:21:01,520
We did it.

6397
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:02,700
We did it.

6398
03:21:03,360 --> 03:21:06,140
And I didn't use my weapon rights once because I keep forgetting.

6399
03:21:06,140 --> 03:21:08,000
We actually carried like everybody asked.

6400
03:21:10,520 --> 03:21:11,040
Hehehehe.

6401
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:11,280
Hehehehe.

6402
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:13,560
The Entrea was our B-doof for the last round.

6403
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:15,440
Hehehehe.

6404
03:21:15,640 --> 03:21:15,920
Hehehehe.

6405
03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:16,320
As promised.

6406
03:21:16,460 --> 03:21:18,640
We were like, here, have some more HMs.

6407
03:21:19,060 --> 03:21:20,440
Have all the rare candies.

6408
03:21:21,500 --> 03:21:25,700
I just unmuted to hear the words four-way tiebreaker and I kind of want to die.

6409
03:21:25,960 --> 03:21:26,460
Hehehehe.

6410
03:21:26,820 --> 03:21:26,880
Hehehehe.

6411
03:21:26,880 --> 03:21:31,380
Oh yeah, it's the four speedrunner slash pro player teams.

6412
03:21:31,380 --> 03:21:33,500
This time, they gotta get us our good side.

6413
03:21:34,460 --> 03:21:36,080
I don't think we were in the tiebreaker.

6414
03:21:36,280 --> 03:21:37,260
Did all the...

6415
03:21:37,260 --> 03:21:38,000
No, we didn't.

6416
03:21:38,140 --> 03:21:39,680
Like, good players get all three.

6417
03:21:39,880 --> 03:21:42,360
I think tiebreakers are whoever beat all three rounds together.

6418
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:43,600
Right, right, right, right.

6419
03:21:44,060 --> 03:21:44,780
Yeah, okay, cool.

6420
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:46,140
Oh God, we can rest.

6421
03:21:46,240 --> 03:21:46,740
We can rest.

6422
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:47,140
Yeah.

6423
03:21:47,480 --> 03:21:48,300
I guess they're...

6424
03:21:48,300 --> 03:21:51,000
Oh, thank God, I don't have to freaking say anything.

6425
03:21:51,240 --> 03:21:52,680
I guess they just have to...

6426
03:21:53,560 --> 03:21:55,000
They have to just like...

6427
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:55,540
I would be too nervous.

6428
03:21:57,500 --> 03:21:58,580
Oh, I guess...

6429
03:21:58,580 --> 03:21:59,360
What the fuck?

6430
03:21:59,540 --> 03:22:00,140
What does the...

6431
03:22:00,140 --> 03:22:01,740
I love the Falling Star Beast.

6432
03:22:01,840 --> 03:22:02,640
He's such a cool boss.

6433
03:22:03,100 --> 03:22:05,000
Oh my God, you can tell they're pros.

6434
03:22:05,260 --> 03:22:06,840
They look like they know what they're doing.

6435
03:22:06,840 --> 03:22:07,340
He really is.

6436
03:22:10,860 --> 03:22:14,620
Hey, I like, killed this guy when I really shouldn't have an Elden Ring.

6437
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:15,960
I know all those moves.

6438
03:22:16,200 --> 03:22:19,520
Do you think we'll get a highlight reel that isn't just them getting exploded this time?

6439
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:20,200
That would be cool.

6440
03:22:20,380 --> 03:22:21,200
That'd be pretty cool.

6441
03:22:21,620 --> 03:22:24,380
Wow, these guys look like they know what they're doing, guys.

6442
03:22:24,380 --> 03:22:25,420
I really would love that.

6443
03:22:25,500 --> 03:22:26,080
Except for him.

6444
03:22:26,280 --> 03:22:26,720
He died.

6445
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:29,200
Yeah, Team Grey wiped there.

6446
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:31,540
Team Grey?

6447
03:22:32,760 --> 03:22:33,880
Yeah, Team Grey just wiped.

6448
03:22:33,880 --> 03:22:33,960
Was Team Grey just wiped?

6449
03:22:34,340 --> 03:22:35,120
Oh, Team Grey wiped?

6450
03:22:35,380 --> 03:22:35,740
Oh, okay.

6451
03:22:36,220 --> 03:22:37,000
Yeah, on the...

6452
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:38,860
Not on the final boss, but on the day two boss.

6453
03:22:38,860 --> 03:22:39,860
Wait, how is that a high...

6454
03:22:39,860 --> 03:22:41,320
Their highlight is a...

6455
03:22:41,320 --> 03:22:42,300
That's fucked up.

6456
03:22:42,420 --> 03:22:43,720
Their highlight was a wipe.

6457
03:22:43,720 --> 03:22:44,560
They're...

6458
03:22:44,560 --> 03:22:45,360
They're...

6459
03:22:45,360 --> 03:22:46,880
That's so fucked up!

6460
03:22:47,380 --> 03:22:48,460
Oh my god!

6461
03:22:49,980 --> 03:22:53,140
Yeah, I swear if we get cucked on the cool highlights again...

6462
03:22:53,140 --> 03:22:53,740
I can't believe it.

6463
03:22:53,740 --> 03:22:54,220
I'm gonna be sad.

6464
03:22:54,220 --> 03:22:54,480
I can't believe it.

6465
03:22:56,360 --> 03:22:57,720
There's so many bosses in this.

6466
03:22:57,920 --> 03:23:00,780
Like, watching the highlights, people are getting stuff that I've not seen at all.

6467
03:23:00,780 --> 03:23:00,900
Yeah.

6468
03:23:00,900 --> 03:23:01,720
Which is really cool.

6469
03:23:01,720 --> 03:23:04,300
I'm just seeing how the bow guy do it.

6470
03:23:04,320 --> 03:23:07,180
You're going to see me do some crazy ass moves, by the way, if they did it.

6471
03:23:07,860 --> 03:23:08,460
Oh, Team Blue!

6472
03:23:08,660 --> 03:23:09,780
Wait, Iron Eyes is meta!

6473
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:10,720
Oh my god!

6474
03:23:10,720 --> 03:23:11,660
I played meta!

6475
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:14,960
Let's go!

6476
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:16,980
Dookie's playing meta cringe.

6477
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:21,360
Okay, Zen's character is also meta, too.

6478
03:23:25,060 --> 03:23:27,320
I had fun on Dutchess, so that's what matters.

6479
03:23:30,260 --> 03:23:30,740
Okay.

6480
03:23:32,040 --> 03:23:32,960
Wait, did Team Blue?

6481
03:23:33,060 --> 03:23:34,120
Team Blue got through, right?

6482
03:23:34,320 --> 03:23:35,320
Team Blue didn't wipe, right?

6483
03:23:35,940 --> 03:23:37,100
I can't imagine they did.

6484
03:23:37,320 --> 03:23:37,600
Yeah.

6485
03:23:37,700 --> 03:23:38,940
They were doing very well most rounds.

6486
03:23:40,960 --> 03:23:41,980
Let him go!

6487
03:23:44,140 --> 03:23:45,500
Playing meta cringe.

6488
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:49,920
Look, I chose Iron Eyes because I don't have to dodge as much, I thought.

6489
03:23:50,880 --> 03:23:54,540
I thought that I wouldn't have to dodge as much, but I was wrong.

6490
03:23:56,960 --> 03:23:58,580
I was very wrong.

6491
03:23:58,580 --> 03:24:01,320
I'm sad we didn't get to fight the Duke's dear Freya.

6492
03:24:02,020 --> 03:24:02,160
Whoa!

6493
03:24:02,440 --> 03:24:03,360
Giant spider.

6494
03:24:05,340 --> 03:24:05,980
Whoa!

6495
03:24:07,360 --> 03:24:10,380
Oh, he uses, like, his thing to dodge.

6496
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:12,060
That's smart, actually.

6497
03:24:12,500 --> 03:24:14,100
Where is this area?

6498
03:24:14,100 --> 03:24:15,760
We've never been here before!

6499
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:18,140
It's underground somewhere, and I don't know where.

6500
03:24:18,700 --> 03:24:20,400
Where is this place?

6501
03:24:20,400 --> 03:24:21,060
It was underground.

6502
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:21,820
Yeah.

6503
03:24:28,060 --> 03:24:29,500
Oh, that was cool.

6504
03:24:30,400 --> 03:24:31,140
Wait, Dancer?

6505
03:24:31,920 --> 03:24:33,100
Sorry, I zoned out.

6506
03:24:33,240 --> 03:24:34,580
I would love to fight Dancer.

6507
03:24:34,840 --> 03:24:35,420
Wait, was...

6508
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:37,180
Is that the guy that he was fighting just in?

6509
03:24:37,640 --> 03:24:38,900
Yeah, Dancer's amazing.

6510
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:39,960
It's a Dark Souls 3 boss.

6511
03:24:39,960 --> 03:24:40,700
Oh!

6512
03:24:42,140 --> 03:24:42,720
Oh!

6513
03:24:43,020 --> 03:24:45,560
I could've just shot the leg for you guys, and he'll get stacked.

6514
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:48,300
Hahaha!

6515
03:24:51,760 --> 03:24:55,300
I could've helped a little more if I shot the leg.

6516
03:24:56,920 --> 03:24:57,500
Hahaha!

6517
03:25:05,040 --> 03:25:05,620
Whoopsie.

6518
03:25:07,400 --> 03:25:11,620
Guys, I'm just watching the... Jesus, the damage that these teams do.

6519
03:25:12,140 --> 03:25:14,380
Yeah, these guys know what they're doing.

6520
03:25:15,340 --> 03:25:17,920
I wonder if they make a leaderboard, you know?

6521
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:22,620
Like, you know how, like, they do, like, leaderboard for, like, runs completed and stuff?

6522
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:24,060
Mm-hmm.

6523
03:25:24,940 --> 03:25:25,900
I wonder if they do that.

6524
03:25:26,900 --> 03:25:28,180
Jesus Christ, now!

6525
03:25:28,600 --> 03:25:30,060
Is this HP just disappeared?

6526
03:25:30,060 --> 03:25:31,540
Oh, did you watch the demihuman queen just explode?

6527
03:25:31,780 --> 03:25:31,960
Yeah.

6528
03:25:32,600 --> 03:25:33,160
What?

6529
03:25:33,900 --> 03:25:36,400
How many seconds was that?

6530
03:25:38,100 --> 03:25:39,620
Holy crap, dude.

6531
03:25:39,660 --> 03:25:39,660
Like, ten.

6532
03:25:40,740 --> 03:25:41,860
Bro, what the fuck?

6533
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:45,260
They did so much damage in two, in three hits!

6534
03:25:46,640 --> 03:25:48,200
Guys, I think...

6535
03:25:49,280 --> 03:25:50,840
They didn't even sweat.

6536
03:25:51,160 --> 03:25:51,440
Bro!

6537
03:25:51,740 --> 03:25:52,540
Hey, look, it's us!

6538
03:25:52,540 --> 03:25:54,240
We're beating the hell out of that guy.

6539
03:25:56,640 --> 03:25:57,860
Oh, my God.

6540
03:25:58,140 --> 03:26:01,940
Oh, yeah, because, like, he marks him, and then the magic just hits the head.

6541
03:26:01,940 --> 03:26:02,620
I think he's dead instantly.

6542
03:26:05,980 --> 03:26:08,200
At least Iron Eyes is meta, guys.

6543
03:26:14,970 --> 03:26:16,950
At least Iron Eyes is meta.

6544
03:26:20,390 --> 03:26:21,310
It's us.

6545
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:33,270
Nice, look at us go.

6546
03:26:38,150 --> 03:26:39,090
Oh, my God.

6547
03:26:41,850 --> 03:26:44,550
Oh, my God, this is us doing poke damage on the dragon.

6548
03:26:48,050 --> 03:26:51,390
Yay, Zen, you got to be seen doing something other than death.

6549
03:26:51,930 --> 03:26:52,450
Yippee!

6550
03:27:00,260 --> 03:27:01,540
This is me kill-stealing.

6551
03:27:01,640 --> 03:27:02,180
I didn't die.

6552
03:27:03,020 --> 03:27:04,420
Yay, kill-steal!

6553
03:27:08,020 --> 03:27:10,960
There's me, kill-stealing the final night lord.

6554
03:27:12,140 --> 03:27:12,780
Oh, shit.

6555
03:27:15,060 --> 03:27:17,300
Team 10 got, like, smacked down there.

6556
03:27:17,300 --> 03:27:19,000
Oh, dancer again.

6557
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:21,720
Yeah.

6558
03:27:28,560 --> 03:27:29,420
Oh, they died.

6559
03:27:29,540 --> 03:27:30,400
Oh, they wiped there?

6560
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:32,080
Yeah.

6561
03:27:32,520 --> 03:27:34,160
They didn't know the pillar strut.

6562
03:27:36,800 --> 03:27:38,700
Those guys haven't fought Jindahad.

6563
03:27:39,740 --> 03:27:42,580
Oh, that's what would have happened if we didn't get to a pillar.

6564
03:27:42,980 --> 03:27:43,740
But did this team wipe?

6565
03:27:44,060 --> 03:27:44,280
Yeah.

6566
03:27:45,180 --> 03:27:46,520
I don't think so.

6567
03:27:47,480 --> 03:27:50,020
I mean, they killed the boss.

6568
03:27:50,260 --> 03:27:50,940
Oh, they killed the boss.

6569
03:27:50,940 --> 03:27:51,480
Oh, yeah, they did.

6570
03:27:51,560 --> 03:27:52,080
Yeah, they did.

6571
03:27:53,980 --> 03:27:54,340
Nice.

6572
03:28:02,390 --> 03:28:04,310
I feel like all the speedrun team...

6573
03:28:04,310 --> 03:28:04,890
Look at that swag strafe.

6574
03:28:05,910 --> 03:28:09,450
They're like, yeah, we'll kill that guy while at the same time dealing with the circle.

6575
03:28:11,030 --> 03:28:12,370
Yeah, like, that's fine.

6576
03:28:14,450 --> 03:28:16,650
Wait, are these teammates okay?

6577
03:28:17,570 --> 03:28:18,130
No.

6578
03:28:18,690 --> 03:28:19,390
Oh, no.

6579
03:28:19,950 --> 03:28:20,250
Goodbye.

6580
03:28:20,830 --> 03:28:22,030
Wait, they can't even...

6581
03:28:22,030 --> 03:28:22,610
Oh, he can't...

6582
03:28:23,210 --> 03:28:23,870
How does...

6583
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:24,870
He can't even get...

6584
03:28:24,870 --> 03:28:25,490
Oh, they just...

6585
03:28:25,490 --> 03:28:26,170
That's the highlight!

6586
03:28:26,830 --> 03:28:27,750
That's the highlight!

6587
03:28:27,990 --> 03:28:29,970
The highlight is I'm getting eaten by the ring.

6588
03:28:30,570 --> 03:28:30,890
Yeah.

6589
03:28:33,610 --> 03:28:35,450
Feels like mage is so squishy, though.

6590
03:28:35,450 --> 03:28:36,910
Like, look at their HP.

6591
03:28:38,170 --> 03:28:38,590
Mm-hmm.

6592
03:28:39,210 --> 03:28:40,450
Yeah, it's mostly about, like...

6593
03:28:41,370 --> 03:28:42,230
Not getting hit.

6594
03:28:42,670 --> 03:28:42,930
Yeah.

6595
03:28:44,410 --> 03:28:45,510
Unfortunately, with your...

6596
03:28:45,510 --> 03:28:48,150
The boss fucking hates you passive, I'm not sure how that would work for you.

6597
03:28:49,010 --> 03:28:50,790
I'm just thinking, like...

6598
03:28:52,030 --> 03:28:54,370
Like, must be, like, mana control, too.

6599
03:28:54,590 --> 03:28:55,110
And everything.

6600
03:28:55,410 --> 03:28:58,390
Because the only way to get mana back is at the grace area.

6601
03:28:58,390 --> 03:28:58,530
Yeah.

6602
03:28:59,490 --> 03:29:03,210
I think you can get skills that give you, like, FP restored on thing.

6603
03:29:03,390 --> 03:29:03,530
Oh.

6604
03:29:04,410 --> 03:29:04,890
Yeah.

6605
03:29:05,590 --> 03:29:06,430
Oh, team green.

6606
03:29:08,790 --> 03:29:09,870
Oh, the ult.

6607
03:29:10,190 --> 03:29:11,050
That's such a good ult.

6608
03:29:11,470 --> 03:29:12,390
Using the ult to...

6609
03:29:13,010 --> 03:29:13,090
Res.

6610
03:29:14,930 --> 03:29:16,470
Oh, why did we never saw this guy?

6611
03:29:16,610 --> 03:29:17,310
The boat guy?

6612
03:29:23,450 --> 03:29:24,990
We just got a...

6613
03:29:24,990 --> 03:29:26,970
Oh, mage has passive mana.

6614
03:29:27,230 --> 03:29:27,470
Oh.

6615
03:29:31,580 --> 03:29:32,060
Yeah.

6616
03:29:32,060 --> 03:29:32,920
So, yeah.

6617
03:29:33,100 --> 03:29:38,320
They're saying, like, you just need to have two tanks to tank everything while you're on mage.

6618
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:39,480
Right.

6619
03:29:40,960 --> 03:29:41,260
Yay.

6620
03:29:41,260 --> 03:29:43,060
Oh, are they saying that we can head out whenever?

6621
03:29:44,020 --> 03:29:44,600
All right.

6622
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:45,200
I'll watch...

6623
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:45,920
Yeah, I think so.

6624
03:29:46,160 --> 03:29:48,300
Well, we watched our highlights, so we don't have to...

6625
03:29:48,300 --> 03:29:49,520
We already watched our highlights.

6626
03:29:49,740 --> 03:29:50,080
Who cares?

6627
03:29:51,140 --> 03:29:51,500
GG's, guys.

6628
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:53,140
I've been live for, like, eight hours.

6629
03:29:53,140 --> 03:29:53,800
It's 2am.

6630
03:29:53,980 --> 03:29:54,620
I'm heading out.

6631
03:29:55,100 --> 03:29:55,280
GG's.

6632
03:29:55,280 --> 03:29:57,000
It was amazing that we did so good.

6633
03:29:57,100 --> 03:29:58,060
I'm so proud of us.

6634
03:29:58,080 --> 03:29:58,120
GG.

6635
03:29:58,120 --> 03:29:59,320
Yeah, thank you so much for the invite, Zen.

6636
03:29:59,320 --> 03:30:00,080
You'll get some rest.

6637
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:00,420
Thank you, Zen.

6638
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:01,360
I had a great time.

6639
03:30:01,360 --> 03:30:01,920
Thank you, Zen.

6640
03:30:03,420 --> 03:30:03,780
GG's.

6641
03:30:03,980 --> 03:30:04,800
It was so fun.

6642
03:30:04,960 --> 03:30:05,500
Thank you, guys.

6643
03:30:05,660 --> 03:30:07,020
I guess everyone do more runs.

6644
03:30:07,440 --> 03:30:08,300
It's so awesome.

6645
03:30:08,560 --> 03:30:10,260
When the game is fully out, let me know.

6646
03:30:10,320 --> 03:30:10,980
I'm so down.

6647
03:30:11,020 --> 03:30:11,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6648
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:12,900
Give me a message anytime.

6649
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:13,340
It'll be fun.

6650
03:30:13,620 --> 03:30:14,360
GG's, guys.

6651
03:30:14,940 --> 03:30:15,300
GG's.

6652
03:30:15,320 --> 03:30:16,020
Good night, friends.

6653
03:30:16,560 --> 03:30:19,360
It's literally coming out tomorrow, or is it the day after?

6654
03:30:19,360 --> 03:30:20,160
It's coming out tomorrow.

6655
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:21,940
It's like tomorrow, I think.

6656
03:30:22,140 --> 03:30:22,240
Yeah.

6657
03:30:22,920 --> 03:30:23,600
Guys, it's tomorrow.

6658
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:24,420
I don't know.

6659
03:30:24,520 --> 03:30:26,340
Chat always gives me the right information.

6660
03:30:27,200 --> 03:30:28,280
Chat's like my chat.

6661
03:30:28,780 --> 03:30:30,440
Chat's like my at grok, you know?

6662
03:30:30,560 --> 03:30:32,260
Like, you're like, at grok is, when is it?

6663
03:30:32,620 --> 03:30:34,700
And instead of at grok, I just do at chat.

6664
03:30:36,240 --> 03:30:37,200
Yeah, it's tomorrow.

6665
03:30:38,320 --> 03:30:38,580
Cool.

6666
03:30:38,840 --> 03:30:39,900
22 hours.

6667
03:30:41,280 --> 03:30:41,900
That's nice.

6668
03:30:42,200 --> 03:30:43,080
Yeah, GG's everyone.

6669
03:30:43,080 --> 03:30:43,920
Have fun.

6670
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:44,420
GG.

6671
03:30:44,920 --> 03:30:45,580
Bye-bye, guys.

6672
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:46,680
I'm so excited.

6673
03:30:47,200 --> 03:30:47,500
Bye-bye.

6674
03:30:48,740 --> 03:30:48,980
Bye.

6675
03:30:51,080 --> 03:30:52,320
Thank you, everyone.

6676
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:54,580
That was so fun.

6677
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:56,780
I still can't believe Jake from Overwatch is...

6678
03:30:57,860 --> 03:30:59,240
Is that Jake from Overwatch?

6679
03:30:59,660 --> 03:31:03,540
I can't believe Jake from Overwatch is casting this.

6680
03:31:05,980 --> 03:31:07,460
But I hope you guys...

6681
03:31:07,460 --> 03:31:07,700
Oh, my God.

6682
03:31:07,700 --> 03:31:08,780
He always knows whenever I'm ending.

6683
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:10,160
He knows, like, my ending voice.

6684
03:31:10,400 --> 03:31:12,340
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

6685
03:31:12,340 --> 03:31:13,820
Oh, his thing got cut off.

6686
03:31:14,160 --> 03:31:14,960
Then she left.

6687
03:31:15,200 --> 03:31:16,600
Then I was going to rejoin, then she left.

6688
03:31:17,680 --> 03:31:18,040
Um...

6689
03:31:18,040 --> 03:31:18,300
No.

6690
03:31:18,780 --> 03:31:19,080
No.

6691
03:31:19,660 --> 03:31:21,780
Anyway, I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching.

6692
03:31:22,180 --> 03:31:22,520
Come on.

6693
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:23,400
Upsies?

6694
03:31:23,720 --> 03:31:25,380
Oh, you don't like it?

6695
03:31:25,500 --> 03:31:25,880
You don't want it?

6696
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:26,480
No, no, no, no.

6697
03:31:28,380 --> 03:31:28,860
Barf anymore.

6698
03:31:29,080 --> 03:31:29,200
Okay.

6699
03:31:29,660 --> 03:31:30,320
He's on my lap.

6700
03:31:30,620 --> 03:31:31,980
Thank you, everyone, for watching.

6701
03:31:33,540 --> 03:31:34,640
It was really fun.

6702
03:31:34,940 --> 03:31:38,800
I had a great time checking out Night Ring.

6703
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:39,660
I think it's actually...

6704
03:31:39,660 --> 03:31:40,520
I think it's really fun.

6705
03:31:40,640 --> 03:31:41,740
Especially when you have a group of friends.

6706
03:31:41,740 --> 03:31:42,400
Um...

6707
03:31:42,400 --> 03:31:43,420
No, I already fed him before.

6708
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:44,740
I fed him, um...

6709
03:31:45,740 --> 03:31:46,680
In the middle of the stream.

6710
03:31:47,260 --> 03:31:47,580
Um...

6711
03:31:47,580 --> 03:31:47,920
But...

6712
03:31:47,920 --> 03:31:50,520
I honestly think it's definitely really, really fun.

6713
03:31:50,740 --> 03:31:51,360
In my opinion.

6714
03:31:51,960 --> 03:31:52,200
Um...

6715
03:31:52,200 --> 03:31:52,700
Especially...

6716
03:31:52,700 --> 03:31:53,920
I think multiplayer was really fun.

6717
03:31:53,920 --> 03:31:54,780
I tried to do solo runs.

6718
03:31:54,920 --> 03:31:55,560
But it wasn't for me.

6719
03:31:56,040 --> 03:31:56,840
Because I feel like...

6720
03:31:57,660 --> 03:31:58,780
If I'm doing solo runs.

6721
03:31:59,180 --> 03:32:00,080
I feel like I just...

6722
03:32:00,080 --> 03:32:02,000
I just rather just play base game on the ring.

6723
03:32:02,300 --> 03:32:05,400
But the multiplayer aspect is definitely, um...

6724
03:32:05,400 --> 03:32:06,540
Really, really fun for me.

6725
03:32:06,800 --> 03:32:07,100
Um...

6726
03:32:07,100 --> 03:32:09,540
I guess those who want to do, like, more roguelike and stuff.

6727
03:32:09,680 --> 03:32:11,900
Like, if they want to do roguelike and more of a challenge.

6728
03:32:12,900 --> 03:32:13,220
Um...

6729
03:32:13,220 --> 03:32:13,620
You got...

6730
03:32:13,620 --> 03:32:14,780
You can try the solo run.

6731
03:32:15,400 --> 03:32:15,720
Um...

6732
03:32:15,720 --> 03:32:16,900
For, like, more of a challenge.

6733
03:32:16,920 --> 03:32:18,280
And for more of, like, the...

6734
03:32:18,280 --> 03:32:20,340
Like, the randomizer type idea.

6735
03:32:21,220 --> 03:32:21,540
Um...

6736
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:21,860
But, like...

6737
03:32:21,860 --> 03:32:23,040
I know there's, like, matchmaking and stuff.

6738
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:25,100
So, it's not like you need to have friends to play it.

6739
03:32:25,180 --> 03:32:26,920
But then, also because it's matchmaking.

6740
03:32:27,380 --> 03:32:27,700
Um...

6741
03:32:27,700 --> 03:32:29,260
You know, sometimes you might not get the best teammates.

6742
03:32:31,240 --> 03:32:34,340
also, You can have doubles of the same character, by the way.

6743
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:35,200
We didn't show it.

6744
03:32:35,220 --> 03:32:38,660
Because obviously, like, why choose doubles of the same character?

6745
03:32:38,800 --> 03:32:39,680
When we won, like...

6746
03:32:39,680 --> 03:32:39,960
You know...

6747
03:32:39,960 --> 03:32:40,700
Like, different characters.

6748
03:32:40,880 --> 03:32:42,460
But you can't, like, have repeats.

6749
03:32:42,620 --> 03:32:43,420
So you can have, like...

6750
03:32:43,420 --> 03:32:44,460
you know, two archers.

6751
03:32:44,740 --> 03:32:45,620
Or, like, um...

6752
03:32:45,620 --> 03:32:47,120
Because we tried it out last...

6753
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:47,560
Like, yesterday.

6754
03:32:48,240 --> 03:32:48,560
But...

6755
03:32:49,240 --> 03:32:50,220
It was really fun.

6756
03:32:50,220 --> 03:32:52,260
I hope you guys loved the preview of Night Reign.

6757
03:32:52,380 --> 03:32:53,820
I had a lot of fun playing it.

6758
03:32:53,940 --> 03:32:55,380
I really enjoyed Archer.

6759
03:32:55,800 --> 03:32:57,540
Um, Archer in it.

6760
03:32:57,780 --> 03:33:00,000
Triple Archers, let's go!

6761
03:33:00,380 --> 03:33:02,460
You know, Triple Archers means three tanks!

6762
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:08,740
But I hope you guys all enjoyed the preview of Night Reign.

6763
03:33:08,860 --> 03:33:14,300
Um, I had a fun time playing with Zen and Laimu, um, you know, getting the experience.

6764
03:33:14,440 --> 03:33:17,700
Like, you know, we're all, you three of us, we're not pros, we're not speedrunners.

6765
03:33:18,120 --> 03:33:22,440
But I think we all three of us did really, really well and we did really good teamwork and everything.

6766
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:26,000
Um, we worked together, like, you know, giving each other gear and everything.

6767
03:33:26,300 --> 03:33:28,160
We don't talk about round two though.

6768
03:33:28,540 --> 03:33:30,200
Round two, I followed up.

6769
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:31,540
I... false prophet.

6770
03:33:31,960 --> 03:33:32,440
Um...

6771
03:33:39,220 --> 03:33:41,580
It wasn't my fault that I died.

6772
03:33:41,580 --> 03:33:42,620
I'll just say that.

6773
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:51,330
Um, um, um, there was only round, there was only round one and three.

6774
03:33:51,750 --> 03:33:53,710
Round two, there was a gas leak.

6775
03:33:54,170 --> 03:33:58,550
Um, but... thank you all for coming.

6776
03:33:58,930 --> 03:34:00,790
Um, I'm gonna head off now.

6777
03:34:01,230 --> 03:34:02,370
Um, very, very busy.

6778
03:34:02,550 --> 03:34:03,350
Very, very busy.

6779
03:34:03,530 --> 03:34:05,730
Ooh, next week there might be a little special announcement!

6780
03:34:06,350 --> 03:34:06,890
On Twitter!

6781
03:34:07,110 --> 03:34:07,910
I don't, on Twitter!

6782
03:34:08,490 --> 03:34:15,430
So, uh, um, can't say what it is, but there might be a really special announcement on Twitter next week, maybe.

6783
03:34:15,990 --> 03:34:21,730
Um, um, I'm really, really excited, but it might mean I'm gonna be super duper busy.

6784
03:34:21,750 --> 03:34:29,450
So the reason why I can't hang out more right now after stream is because I'm very, very busy, um, next month in June.

6785
03:34:29,710 --> 03:34:31,970
Um, and you'll know why very soon.

6786
03:34:31,970 --> 03:34:33,390
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

6787
03:34:33,450 --> 03:34:35,070
You'll know why next week.

6788
03:34:35,110 --> 03:34:38,750
Uh, why I'll be very, very busy in June.

6789
03:34:39,310 --> 03:34:44,690
Um, anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around, and get that blood flowing.

6790
03:34:44,790 --> 03:34:48,070
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it!

6791
03:34:48,170 --> 03:34:49,270
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

6792
03:34:49,810 --> 03:34:50,450
Bye guys!

6793
03:34:50,650 --> 03:34:50,990
Bye!

6794
03:34:51,310 --> 03:34:53,270
Feel free to check out Lime and Zen!

6795
03:34:53,550 --> 03:34:54,370
Great teammates!

6796
03:34:54,630 --> 03:34:55,670
It was a very fun time.

6797
03:34:55,770 --> 03:34:57,290
They were both really, really good at Souls game.

6798
03:34:57,290 --> 03:34:59,490
And then I was the archer!

6799
03:34:59,630 --> 03:35:00,470
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

6800
03:35:00,710 --> 03:35:01,270
Bye guys!

6801
03:35:01,570 --> 03:35:01,910
Bye!

6802
03:35:01,910 --> 03:35:02,170
Bye!
