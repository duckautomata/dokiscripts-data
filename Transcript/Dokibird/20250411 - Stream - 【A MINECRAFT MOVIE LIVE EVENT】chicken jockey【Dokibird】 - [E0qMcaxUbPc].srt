00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,960
Hello.

2
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,840
You like my little chicken?

3
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,760
My tiny chicken.

4
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,550
A little chicken on my head.

5
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,490
I am the chicken chucky now.

6
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,010
So I'm really tired.

7
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,630
I'm so fucking tired right now.

8
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,310
Doki chucky.

9
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,790
I'm sorry guys.

10
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,010
I'm sorry for the late stream.

11
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,070
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,130
Okay, so I'm not hungover.

13
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,150
I'm not hungover.

14
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,230
It's because...

15
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,730
Okay, the reason why I'm late is because...

16
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,510
I said it in chat, but...

17
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,930
It's the time of the month.

18
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,410
It started last night.

19
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,910
Right after the other stream.

20
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,510
The Mariva stream.

21
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,190
And like, I don't know you guys know.

22
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,850
Okay, so here's a little fun fact.

23
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,810
Woman!

24
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,990
Yeah, like...

25
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,330
So...

26
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,530
So...

27
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,430
Okay, so here's a little fun fact for people...

28
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,970
For the people out there who, you know...

29
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,550
Don't have that...

30
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,690
The lucky individuals that don't have to go through this every month.

31
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,130
But basically...

32
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,730
If you mix alcohol with it being when the blood moon rises...

33
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,970
It's not good for you.

34
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,170
And occasionally...

35
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,930
You lose more blood when you drink.

36
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,590
So...

37
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,150
So the timing couldn't be more worse than...

38
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:28,250
The timing couldn't be more worse than...

39
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,210
Yeah, than it could be.

40
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,890
So when I woke up...

41
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,090
When I woke up today at 12.30...

42
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,070
I was like...

43
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,370
Am I alive?

44
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,070
I was like...

45
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,130
I was just like...

46
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,130
I was like...

47
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,290
I was not okay.

48
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,330
I was like...

49
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,730
And then I messaged my mom.

50
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,610
And I was like, can you change the stream?

51
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,230
I can't open my eyes.

52
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,970
Forgot.

53
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,130
Okay, so...

54
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,390
The thing is, for me...

55
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,170
Mine is super inconsistent.

56
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,350
It's never...

57
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,130
Stress levels affect...

58
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,250
Another fun fact for those...

59
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,430
It's so fun, guys.

60
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,110
Oh, man.

61
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,090
I wish you guys get to experience...

62
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,850
Some of you guys get to experience it too.

63
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,230
It's just the funnest time ever, guys.

64
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,170
It's so fun.

65
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,030
Man, I'm happy I get to do this every month.

66
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,070
Oh, my God.

67
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,130
I wish it happens every two weeks.

68
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,710
Oh, I'm having so much fun.

69
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,630
Anyway.

70
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,070
So, here's another fun fact.

71
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,910
Stress levels affect when it starts.

72
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,530
So, like...

73
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,610
It's so inconsistent.

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,870
Because I'm very stressed.

75
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,390
Sometimes I'm very stressed out.

76
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,390
So...

77
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,790
Sometimes it would be like, you know...

78
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,430
Two months.

79
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,930
Three months.

80
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,650
Like...

81
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,890
It's... I don't know when.

82
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,970
It's always a surprise.

83
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,790
So, like, when it happens...

84
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,790
I'm like...

85
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,150
Whoa.

86
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,610
It's just...

87
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,590
It's just...

88
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,110
Surprise.

89
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,610
It's like, you know...

90
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,450
A little...

91
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,610
A surprise gift every time.

92
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,630
Whoa.

93
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,090
Happy birthday, Doki.

94
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:50,890
Surprise.

95
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,110
Don't you...

96
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,730
Ain't surprises great?

97
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,070
Whoa.

98
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,990
It's like, gotcha.

99
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,450
Yeah.

100
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,130
It's like, gotcha.

101
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,710
Raymond.

102
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,650
Thank you for the super chat.

103
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,050
Thank you.

104
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,570
Thank you.

105
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,490
Skill issue.

106
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,870
No name.

107
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,770
Thank you for the super chat.

108
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,730
Thank you.

109
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,270
Pass, but you can keep trying...

110
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,730
But can you...

111
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,370
You can try projecting your pain to other...

112
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,850
Thank you for the super chat.

113
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,250
Thank you.

114
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,830
Thank you.

115
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,170
Not so Deadpool.

116
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,730
Thank you for the Akasupa.

117
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,070
Thank you.

118
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,770
Thank you.

119
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,610
Akasupa for your...

120
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,370
Okay.

121
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,670
That one was good.

122
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,910
Thank you for the Akasupa.

123
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,450
Thank you.

124
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,450
Thank you.

125
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,510
Thank you for the super chat.

126
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:37,890
Thank you.

127
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,590
Thank you.

128
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,710
Is there a calendar app or something?

129
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,930
I don't remember that.

130
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,870
It's irregular.

131
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,210
It's incredibly irregular.

132
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,090
I've like...

133
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,950
I've like stopped like trying to figure out when it's gonna be years ago.

134
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:51,910
It's...

135
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,730
You don't...

136
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,110
It's...

137
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,830
You don't know.

138
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,330
It's just...

139
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,050
It's always a little surprise every time.

140
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,010
I'll be like, oh, there it is.

141
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,330
The blood moon.

142
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,790
Woo.

143
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,750
It's just unfortunate that...

144
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:16,430
It's very unfortunate that it happened when...

145
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,430
At post-drinking.

146
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,750
Post-drinking because the moon haunts you.

147
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,510
Because like, that's like the worst...

148
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,350
The worst timing it could ever get be...

149
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,390
It could ever be.

150
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,250
So...

151
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,490
It's...

152
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,730
It's actually...

153
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,730
It fucks me up even more.

154
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,110
Because I...

155
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,370
I've never...

156
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,790
I've never been like this tired before.

157
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,150
No, I have been this...

158
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,550
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,490
My brain's not working right now.

160
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,110
I'm still waking up.

161
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,010
It's like revving an engine.

162
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,790
It's like...

163
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,030
I'm revving an engine right now in my brain.

164
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,730
But like, it's so difficult because it's like...

165
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,050
Oh my god.

166
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,530
You're not supposed to make...

167
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,390
You're not supposed to drink when it happens.

168
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,730
But like, of course it happens.

169
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,670
Like, of course...

170
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,650
Of course...

171
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,430
Of course it happens.

172
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,390
Oh my god.

173
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,010
How lucky can I get?

174
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,890
I already...

175
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,870
Bro...

176
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,470
I already got like...

177
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,250
Post...

178
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,690
Like, post-rival's depression.

179
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,590
And then...

180
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,530
You want more fucked up shit happening right now?

181
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,370
This last couple of weeks.

182
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,190
You're like, here, have this too.

183
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,590
Alright.

184
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,150
Alright, guys.

185
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:46,810
So...

186
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,250
So...

187
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,750
Also, yeah, I ran out of...

188
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,170
I ran out of painkillers.

189
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,550
Actually, no.

190
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,530
I didn't run out of painkillers.

191
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,390
I never...

192
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,370
Actually, did I run out of painkillers?

193
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,830
Or I just never bought painkillers?

194
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,430
I don't know.

195
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,470
I don't know.

196
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,690
I just don't like...

197
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,290
I was like, where's my Tylenol?

198
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,490
And I was like, looking around.

199
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,650
And I was like, where the fuck did I...

200
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,310
I have Tylenol for, like, sinuses.

201
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,490
And I was like, bro, what?

202
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,670
I guess I never bought, like...

203
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,510
I never bought, like, regular painkillers.

204
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,490
I only bought, like, Tylenol and...

205
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,490
Tylenol for, like, fucking...

206
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,430
Like, fever and cold.

207
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,830
But never for, like, actual pain.

208
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,910
So I need to get a...

209
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,790
I need...

210
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,010
Okay.

211
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,310
And also, like, I usually never get cramps.

212
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,350
That's the thing.

213
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,150
I usually never get cramps.

214
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,990
So, like, it's really bad if...

215
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,450
The alcohol made it, like, a lot worse.

216
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,370
I was like, oh my God, this pain.

217
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,530
I don't...

218
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,830
I don't remember this pain.

219
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,990
I was like, it's been so long.

220
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,680
I was just like, oh my God.

221
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,620
It's been so long since I felt this pain.

222
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,200
Oh my God, the alcohol actually made it worse.

223
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,780
No!

224
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,220
Why?

225
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
The content!

226
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
Okay, anyway.

227
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,420
So, today...

228
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,100
Also, I hope you guys don't mind, but I have to tweet out the Call of Duty tournament thing.

229
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,960
Because, you know, when I woke up, I went straight here.

230
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,340
I woke up, I went straight here.

231
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,020
So, I need to tweet this out.

232
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,380
Because it's happening in three hours as well.

233
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,380
Okay, let's see.

234
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,780
I need to look at...

235
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,880
Sorry, I'm doing all of this live right now.

236
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,960
Alright.

237
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,420
Let's see.

238
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,740
Where is it?

239
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,180
Oh, yeah.

240
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,220
So, for those who don't know.

241
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
You know, like, it's funny.

242
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,400
They, like...

243
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,340
They made this image for me the draft day.

244
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,340
The draft day.

245
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,060
They're like, can we add your picture onto the thing?

246
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
And I was like, yeah.

247
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,580
And then they just...

248
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,300
They, like...

249
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,360
They inserted me into their, like...

250
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,600
Sponsor image thing.

251
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
So, like, they made this.

252
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,680
Which I thought was...

253
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,640
That was pretty cute.

254
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,960
I was like, oh, that's silly.

255
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,940
So, they're like, can we have a PNG of, like, you?

256
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,860
So, we can put it in.

257
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
And I sent the folder.

258
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,220
And then they just insert PNG of me here.

259
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,940
And I'm like, oh, that's cute.

260
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm so out of place.

261
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,900
I know.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
I was like, yay, three thumbnail.

263
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,510
They picked this one.

264
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,010
And they're just like, okay, here you go.

265
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,470
She looks so happy.

266
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,390
She doesn't know.

267
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,930
This was past Doki.

268
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,210
Looking forward to today.

269
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,970
A fun day today.

270
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,450
Nothing bad will happen to her.

271
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,330
Alright, let's see.

272
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,910
Today...

273
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,390
I'll see you guys on Twitch.

274
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,370
Twitch today at 4pm PST.

275
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,630
I have no idea what the fuck draft day is.

276
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,790
I should read the briefing.

277
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,110
I hope the sponsors...

278
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,310
Okay, the sponsors are not watching the Minecraft stream.

279
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,370
After this stream, I need to read the briefing.

280
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,550
I was going to read it yesterday.

281
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,910
But, obviously, yesterday I was not okay.

282
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,470
So, I shall read the briefing.

283
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,250
I shall read the briefing post this stream.

284
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,090
And then I should be okay, guys.

285
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,910
Everything will be okay.

286
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,510
I'm trying very hard to function right now.

287
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,210
Also, like I said, when I woke up, I went straight...

288
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,050
I usually would wake up early just to finish... just to prep everything.

289
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,990
But, like, I did not.

290
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,550
So, let's see.

291
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,490
Minecraft.

292
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,170
Because I'm launching Minecraft.

293
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,690
Okay, so apparently, it is on Bedrock for this event.

294
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,750
For those who don't know...

295
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,730
For those who don't know about the Minecraft Live...

296
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,950
A lot of people were like, what the fuck is the Minecraft Movie Live event?

297
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,770
So, the Minecraft Movie Live event is basically...

298
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,390
Oh, there it is.

299
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,150
Oh my god, it's so fucking silly.

300
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,430
It's to celebrate the release of the official movie, the Minecraft movie.

301
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,070
And it's basically a special event that will last up to, I think, like two weeks.

302
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,970
They extended it.

303
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,370
Oh my god, English is so hard right now.

304
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,830
I'm not hungover, I'm just... I might be low on blood right now.

305
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,810
I drank water, so my body is trying to create more blood.

306
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,390
My body is trying to...

307
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,090
My body is trying to create more blood right now to make up for it.

308
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,760
Anyway...

309
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,120
Low on oxygen, low on blood.

310
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,220
Okay.

311
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:58,860
Anyway, so it's basically a special server where you can meet Steve from the Minecraft Movie.

312
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,420
You can meet Jack Black and Jason Momoa from the Minecraft Movie in this event.

313
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,800
And then there's like special games and stuff.

314
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,320
And if you complete the little mini-games and everything...

315
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah, the real Steve!

316
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Okay, I haven't watched the Minecraft Movie yet.

317
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,000
But like...

318
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,540
I've seen the dialogue from that movie.

319
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
And the fact that it's like, Let's mine.

320
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,420
Let's craft.

321
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,800
Let's Minecraft.

322
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,280
That might not be like the exact line from the movie.

323
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,300
But I'm just like, what the fuck?

324
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay, what I really like about this movie...

325
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:53,940
Is that it's basically the newest Rocky Horror movie.

326
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,020
So people in the past...

327
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,220
I don't think a lot of people do it nowadays for Rocky Horror.

328
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,300
Because this was more of a 90s thing that had the cult following.

329
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,920
And so people used to do it where audiences would react to the movie and the lines.

330
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,400
And then react.

331
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
It was more like a performance type deal.

332
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
It's like audience participation.

333
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,320
The Rocky Horror show, yeah.

334
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,100
So people used to do that.

335
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,100
And The Room as well.

336
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,160
And I think the Minecraft Movie is the next audience participation movie.

337
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,360
Because when it came out, everybody was like...

338
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,380
Chicken Jockey!

339
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,060
But I think the only fucked up part about it is that...

340
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,380
There's also a lot of very egotistical and conceited children doing it too.

341
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,520
Who think there's no consequences.

342
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,820
So in the Rocky Horror movie show...

343
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,380
Sorry, the Rocky Horror show...

344
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,500
And The Room...

345
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,840
It was more so of acting around the movie itself.

346
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,820
And just, you know...

347
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,720
Costumes, wearing costumes.

348
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,140
And reciting the lines.

349
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,880
But for the Minecraft Movie, people are actually throwing popcorn around.

350
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,740
I thought at first it was really funny.

351
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,720
But it's been getting worse.

352
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,120
I saw people getting worse and worse.

353
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,180
And then, yeah.

354
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,160
Throwing the chicken one...

355
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,340
I was like...

356
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay.

357
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,260
I didn't...

358
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,040
The throwing the chicken one was a little too far.

359
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,740
Because, I don't know if you guys heard...

360
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,080
About the...

361
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
The video about the chicken.

362
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,760
But the guy who did that...

363
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,000
Abandoned the chicken.

364
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,660
Right after.

365
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,400
I was like, what the fuck?

366
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,260
I was like...

367
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,260
I was like...

368
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,800
Yeah, no.

369
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,300
He literally filmed himself...

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,700
Abandoning the chicken later.

371
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,460
And then, someone was like...

372
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,780
And then, people in the chat was like...

373
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,040
What the fuck?

374
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,660
And then, he was like...

375
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,520
Chickens get killed...

376
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,940
100 million chickens get killed every year.

377
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
For food.

378
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
This doesn't change it.

379
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,840
We're just returning the chicken to the farm.

380
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,060
And I was like...

381
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,280
What the fuck?

382
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,600
This guy is a fucking teenager, by the way.

383
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,780
A teenager slash young adult.

384
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't know how old he is.

385
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,080
But he seems like one.

386
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,200
And I was like...

387
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,260
That is so messed up.

388
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,680
I was like...

389
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,260
Yeah.

390
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,160
I was like...

391
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,980
Yeah, no.

392
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,920
It was like some fucking TikTok creator.

393
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,380
I was like...

394
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:45,800
Bro.

395
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,460
Yeah.

396
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,060
I was like...

397
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,320
Yeah.

398
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,240
What the fuck?

399
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,640
I was like...

400
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,580
So...

401
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,420
At first, it was really fun.

402
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,680
But then...

403
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,460
People made it too extreme.

404
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,440
Because it was like...

405
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,880
They see other videos.

406
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,460
And they're like...

407
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,260
I'm gonna do it.

408
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,940
But do it something even bigger and better.

409
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,820
And then they just started...

410
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,840
Fucking throwing food around.

411
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,340
And throwing eggs at people in the movie.

412
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,860
And shit like that.

413
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,480
Because the first couple of videos were really funny.

414
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:28,980
You know?

415
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,420
Everyone was just cheering and clapping.

416
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,960
That shit was funny.

417
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,000
Chicken Jackie and everyone celebrating it.

418
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,020
It was like World Peace was fucking...

419
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,680
World Peace was announced.

420
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,180
And everybody was like...

421
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,860
And clapping and celebrating.

422
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,500
Jumping and hugging each other.

423
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,120
That shit was funny.

424
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,680
But then people just started throwing food.

425
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,940
And chickens.

426
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,760
And body slamming employees.

427
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,180
I was like...

428
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,120
That's not cool.

429
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,220
Because they wanted to be on...

430
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,920
They just wanted to be filmed for Haha Funny.

431
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,660
I was just like...

432
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,260
It was a funny experience.

433
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,500
But people just made it so much worse.

434
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,600
I really was looking for...

435
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,660
I wanted to watch the Minecraft movie.

436
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,180
At a theater.

437
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,940
Because I feel like if you watched it...

438
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,980
If you watched it in the beginning.

439
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,680
If you watched it in the beginning.

440
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,500
I think it would have been more enjoyable.

441
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,140
Because people didn't get too extreme now.

442
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,120
I think movie goers now are just trying to make it more and more...

443
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,760
Because they're like...

444
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
I saw videos.

445
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,880
I saw videos of this happening.

446
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,660
So now I want to do this and that.

447
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,360
I don't want to get popcorn thrown at me guys.

448
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,780
I just don't want to get popcorn or eggs thrown at me.

449
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,100
So I'm a little scared to go.

450
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,500
I don't know.

451
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:24,980
I don't know.

452
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,580
I might go to a VIP theater or some shit.

453
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,120
Because I feel like that would be more calm.

454
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,900
Rent the entire theater.

455
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
I don't know.

456
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,620
I was really looking forward to it.

457
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,500
Because...

458
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,820
Yeah, VIP.

459
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,560
Only the best for the...

460
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,580
Guys, only the best for the Minecraft movie.

461
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,380
Yeah, no.

462
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,160
That's the thing.

463
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,820
The reason why I was thinking...

464
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,360
Maybe I should go to a VIP movie theater.

465
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,660
Is because I was like...

466
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,320
Children can't be...

467
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,000
It has to be 18+.

468
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,540
Because a VIP movie theater...

469
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,180
Is basically like...

470
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,340
You can drink alcohol while you're watching a movie.

471
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,660
Which now I'm thinking about it...

472
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,200
Might not be the best idea.

473
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,780
Because you can literally order alcohol from the bar...

474
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,460
While you're sitting in your seat.

475
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,480
But you have to be 18 and plus to be able to go in.

476
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,480
So I was like...

477
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,180
Okay, maybe children won't be there.

478
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,560
I was thinking, oh man, children won't be there.

479
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,420
But then I'm like, oh no.

480
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,080
There's going to be a bunch of fucking drunk adults watching this.

481
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,480
Because I think everybody has the same plan as me.

482
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,500
They're like, we gotta drink to watch this movie.

483
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,120
So drunk college students...

484
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,880
So I don't know.

485
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,040
I don't know if it would be better.

486
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,780
But I just don't want popcorn thrown at me while I'm watching the movie.

487
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm just not up for that.

488
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm not really into that, guys.

489
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,440
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

490
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,080
Thank you, thank you.

491
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,280
Why not membership watch?

492
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,280
Oh man, actually I really would want to do a membership watch of the Minecraft movie.

493
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,320
But also like...

494
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,820

495
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,700

499
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,860

Okay, download.

502
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,680
I do want to watch it.

503
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,460
But then I really also want to watch an Athelier too.

504
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,960
I could watch it...

505
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,160
Decisions, decisions.

506
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,820
Next movie has...

507
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,060
Next watch has to be a good movie?

508
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,760
You promised.

509
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,120
Yeah.

510
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,920
Isn't Minecraft movie a good movie, guys?

511
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,420
But the Minecraft movie is a good movie.

512
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,040
What are you trying to say?

513
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,120
What are you...

514
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,860
What are you trying to say, guys?

515
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,600
Is it not a good movie?

516
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,220
Alright, let's see.

517
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,620
Alright.

518
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,620
Yeah, we won't stand for this slander.

519
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,960
Did I download it?

520
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,740
Wait, encountered an issue?

521
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,060
Wait, why did...

522
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,960
Is there an issue?

523
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,520
No, you can't do this to me.

524
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,620
Wait, no.

525
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,720
I want to meet Steve.

526
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,440
Let me meet Steve.

527
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,800
Oh, nice.

528
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,840
Oh, nice.

529
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,240
Okay.

530
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,060
I'm in.

531
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,580
Okay.

532
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,710
Sorry, I have to hydrate.

533
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,990
I forgot I'm...

534
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,850
I forgot that I'm the Cheshire Cat.

535
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,770
Okay.

536
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,950
I'm the Cheshire...

537
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,350
Let me go to the dressing room real quick.

538
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,490
Let me change my skin.

539
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,550
Now I can be Sans.

540
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,690
Alright, let me be Sans Undertale instead.

541
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,430
Alright, yippee.

542
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,670
It's me, Sans.

543
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,690
It's me, Sans.

544
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,130
Alright, resume game.

545
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,570
Hello, I'm here for Steve.

546
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,710
There's supposed to be a black screen?

547
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,490
Hello?

548
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,290
Oh.

549
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,550
What the fuck?

550
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,670
Hello?

551
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,010
Where my game at?

552
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,330
What the fuck?

553
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,470
Where is my game?

554
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,150
Where is my...

555
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,630
Okay, let me...

556
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,150
Okay, obviously there's some...

557
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,770
No, I want to meet Steve.

558
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,290
There he is.

559
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,800
Steve.

560
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,560
Oh, there I go.

561
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,000
Save the village.

562
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,420
Save the world.

563
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,800
Hello, everybody.

564
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,220
Oh, my God.

565
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,940
Where's the...

566
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,700
Wait, he talks.

567
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,880
Hi there, partner.

568
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,060
How are things going outside the village?

569
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,280
How's my...

570
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, my God.

571
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,600
Steve!

572
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,140
That's my pal Henry getting on.

573
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,600
I bet he's doing his...

574
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,720
Wait, there's...

575
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,620
There's actual, like, voice lines from Jack Black.

576
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,840
Wait, what the fuck?

577
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,040
Hello, Steve.

578
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,820
Alright.

579
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,520
Oh, my God.

580
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,340
It's the real Steve, guys.

581
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
There he is.

582
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,520
Oh, my God.

583
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,080
Steve.

584
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,760
Thank you, Mr. Steve.

585
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,080
Alright.

586
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,300
Let's see.

587
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,480
Oh, my God.

588
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,780
Wait, how do I do emotes again?

589
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,520
I don't remember.

590
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,560
How do you do...

591
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:53,960
Oh, my God.

592
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,520
There I am.

593
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,560
There I am.

594
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,900
Me and Steve.

595
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,220
Take pictures, guys.

596
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,000
Wait, how do...

597
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,160
Do you guys remember how to do emotes?

598
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,840
I don't remember.

599
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,040
I don't remember.

600
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,720
How do I...

601
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,000
Guys, how do I do emotes, guys?

602
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Is it B?

603
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,700
Alright.

604
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,180
Nice.

605
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,640
I just want to do this next to Steve.

606
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,020
Roll out.

607
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,330
Yippee.

608
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:44,670
I fucking...

609
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,930
Best fucking purchases of my life.

610
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,530
Oh, my God.

611
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,590
There's all the villagers.

612
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,990
There they are.

613
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,750
There's a little cat there.

614
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,730
I want to explore.

615
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,210
Let's see.

616
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,530
Is this all from the movie?

617
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,470
All of these?

618
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,230
Did he just say Flint and Steel?

619
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,110
I think he said Flint and Steel just then.

620
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,250
Oh, my God.

621
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,130
There it is.

622
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,810
There's chicken lava.

623
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,790
I can't believe...

624
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,690
Okay, if you get the...

625
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,350
Oh, my God.

626
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,010
There it is.

627
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,490
I got the chicken.

628
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,250
I got the lava chicken.

629
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,630
Get the fucking stupid lava chicken.

630
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,250
Oh, my God.

631
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,210
Oh, I'm fast.

632
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,690
Holy shit.

633
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,010
I'm so fast.

634
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,190
Look at me.

635
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:39,830
Oh, my God.

636
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,810
I was too fast.

637
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,570
Wait, there's...

638
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,890
Why is there a little piglet in here?

639
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,230
What are you doing here?

640
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:45,770
What are you doing?

641
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,750
This is not for you.

642
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,170
Get out of here.

643
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,630
You don't belong in the city.

644
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,170
Oh, he's gone.

645
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,670
That's fucking right.

646
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,850
Get out of here.

647
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,350
You don't belong here.

648
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,510
That's right.

649
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,430
This is a villager-only city.

650
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:03,430
Okay, so, like, for those who don't know, the official soundtrack for...

651
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:13,870
The official soundtrack for the Minecraft movie has, like, a 30-second segment of Jack Black singing the lava chicken song.

652
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,890
I'm just like, why?

653
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:17,610
Why?

654
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,130
Why is there...

655
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,890
Like, it's literally just 30 seconds of Jack Black being like...

656
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,410
Chicken, lava, lava.

657
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,710
Chicken, lava, chicken.

658
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,590
It's a good part.

659
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,030
Okay, you don't understand, Doki.

660
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,790
It was a good part of this movie.

661
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,450
Alright, what else is there?

662
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,710
Oh my god, there's a music room.

663
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,330
Wait.

664
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,390
You have to buy this?

665
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,250
Oh, that's where...

666
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:45,610
That's...

667
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,210
Oh my god, you can buy a sheep.

668
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,810
What do I do with the sheep?

669
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,290
Oh, that's where he got it.

670
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,830
I was like, oh, I thought it was, like, an emote.

671
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,170
Oh, this guy's been playing this for a while.

672
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,050
Wait, can you wear this hat?

673
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,950
Wait, did he buy a hat?

674
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,190
Oh my god, he did!

675
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,150
Wait, oh!

676
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,870
Oh, you can buy, like, cosmetic hats and everything.

677
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,450
Go to the bell tower?

678
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,710
Where's the bell tower?

679
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,150
Where is it?

680
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,530
Is this the bell tower?

681
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,050
I'm exploring.

682
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,850
It was so nice of them to put a small YouTuber.

683
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:29,730
Oh my god, he said the...

684
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,130
Oh my god!

685
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,230
Guys, he said the thing!

686
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,910
He said it.

687
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,210
Oh my god, it's like watching the movie right now.

688
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,090
It's like I'm actually watching the movie, guys.

689
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,850
He fucking said that thing.

690
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,690
Why do I have to go to a CD-R when I can just play this game?

691
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,450
No way!

692
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:07,230
I can't believe they put small YouTuber Jablinski Games into this game, guys.

693
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:07,990
Into this film.

694
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,530
If he can make it, anyone can make it, guys.

695
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,630
Alright.

696
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,040
Let's have a little duet.

697
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,280
With Hatsune Miku and Sans.

698
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,290
And then he jumped.

699
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,470
Do a flip.

700
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,990
Wait, what other stuff is there?

701
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:46,590
There's so many.

702
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,580
Oh, I guess these are all...

703
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,430
Don't worry.

704
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,510
This is our new duet together.

705
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,230
Oh wait, shit.

706
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,650
No, don't leave!

707
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,650
No, I didn't mean to eat my lava chicken!

708
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,090
Okay, let's see.

709
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,350
What do we...

710
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,290
Okay, so there's like different types of games that we can do.

711
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,530
And apparently, like, you get to...

712
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:20,590
If you accomplish the mini-games, you can get a free cape that you can only wear in bedrock condition.

713
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,530
But that's okay.

714
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,370
Oh look, Jason Momoa!

715
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,870
He's so out of place in here.

716
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,770
Why is he so tall?

717
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,150
Why does he look so...

718
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,690
Oh wait, no, he's the same size as me.

719
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,230
Ah, my new projects has arrived.

720
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,890
We're protecting the village walls from the piglins and we need our best fighters.

721
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,470
Think you're up to the challenge?

722
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,030
Let's go.

723
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,090
Is he taller than me?

724
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:44,910
No.

725
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,380
No, he just...

726
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,560
Why does he...

727
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,500
Oh, it's the waist.

728
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,680
I don't know.

729
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,720
There's something about him that he just...

730
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,460
It just seems like he looks taller than me and I don't know why.

731
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,320
Hello, Garrett.

732
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,240
Wait, I want to take a picture with you.

733
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,140
Give me a sec.

734
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,280
Alright.

735
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,580
Roll out.

736
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,880
Alright, Garrett, let's go.

737
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,240
Yes, I want to do it.

738
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,200
I shall protect the village.

739
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,380
Let me protect our village, Garrett.

740
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,120
More than meets the eye.

741
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,220
But I don't know if I want to watch the movie for a member stream or like...

742
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,540
Oh wait, the gate's already broken.

743
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,120
Wait, why...

744
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,800
Guys, I'm still in the cutscene.

745
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Why is the gate broken?

746
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,380
Wait, that's not fair.

747
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm like literally in the cutscene.

748
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,400
The more piglins you take down, the bigger your reward.

749
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
Oh, so like...

750
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,160
Oh my god, look, there's a guy with a sword.

751
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,900
Okay, so apparently I need to...

752
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,820
Wait, no, and then...

753
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,380
Oh, wait.

754
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,500
Who's in my army?

755
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,800
Oh wait, the gate's being broken right now.

756
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,660
Oh wait, that's bad.

757
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,900
Wait, can I die?

758
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,620
Look at all these guys.

759
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,300
You know...

760
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,220
Look at the one guy.

761
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,140
He's like, remember to use range.

762
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,680
And then there's this one guy that's just like, I don't need range.

763
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,740
He's like, I don't need that shit.

764
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,160
Come down and get me.

765
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,080
He's holding the line.

766
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,060
Yeah, he's holding...

767
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,780
He's actually holding the entire fort for us.

768
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,460
He's a real gamer.

769
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh my god, wait.

770
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,720
We have like, golems that only get this one man to take on the entire world.

771
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,740
He's just built different.

772
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,100
Can we shoot each other?

773
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,120
No.

774
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,140
What's the point?

775
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,260
What's that?

776
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,000
Watch this.

777
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,580
Boom.

778
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,560
Boom.

779
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,980
Look at that.

780
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,280
Look at that.

781
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,800
Fucking aim right there.

782
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,460
Even in Minecraft, I can aim.

783
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,040
Okay, ignore that.

784
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,860
Okay, but that shot was sick though.

785
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,540
Okay, ignore that though.

786
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,940
Oh, ow.

787
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,740
Okay, wait.

788
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,900
That's not fair.

789
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,800
They shoot back.

790
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,220
Oh my god, bro.

791
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,540
Oh my god.

792
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,800
Save him.

793
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,800
Bro, he's 1v5 right now.

794
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,840
Oh, that's just a golem.

795
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
I don't have to care about that.

796
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,220
Oh wait, but he's gonna kill him.

797
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,280
Let's see.

798
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,620
We can do it.

799
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,860
I'm just gonna save him.

800
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm a hero.

801
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,440
I'm a fucking hero.

802
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,900
I need that XP too.

803
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,440
I need this XP.

804
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,120
No!

805
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,680
Mr. Golem!

806
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,040
He likes those odds.

807
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:56,840
Oh no.

808
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,480
Oh no, they're going for him next.

809
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,440
Oh no.

810
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,860
Run, golem, fight back!

811
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,680
Don't just stand there, fight back!

812
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,860
Oh shit.

813
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,380
Oh, he's coming here to sweep all those kills.

814
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,740
Where did he come from?

815
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,220
He's like, yoink my kill.

816
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,380
No, I need that one.

817
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,380
No, I need that XP.

818
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,160
Okay, I yoinked my XP.

819
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,020
Oh my god, I'm gonna kill a child too.

820
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,300
That's right.

821
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,560
Get out of here, child.

822
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,100
I need that.

823
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,480
Daddy needs a new cape.

824
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,040
Get out of there.

825
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,260
Jump down.

826
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,640
Guys, I'm not crazy like...

827
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,580
Guys, that guy has a fucking costume.

828
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,780
He's been doing this for the last two weeks, man.

829
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,400
Bro, this guy has been playing in the server for two weeks now.

830
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,700
Like, he knows what he's doing.

831
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm just a little archer boy.

832
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,720
Don't be a hero, Doki.

833
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,680
That's fine.

834
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,900
I have this.

835
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,780
Oh no, they might get the gates though.

836
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,200
Wait, how long...

837
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,840
How long...

838
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,000
Like, look at him.

839
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,820
He has a fucking hammer.

840
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,940
Like, I...

841
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,700
How does...

842
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,160
Oh shit.

843
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,200
How does he have a hammer?

844
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,800
Bro, he has like this little...

845
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,840
Like, double hammer shit.

846
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,800
He's scary.

847
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,240
Wait, I should eat this.

848
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,460
I'll start playing music for everybody.

849
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,820
Guys,

850
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,260
I don't think...

851
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
I don't think they liked my music.

852
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,760
I don't think...

853
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,480
Alright, guys.

854
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,160
I shall play music for the crew.

855
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,740
Let's all play a battle song.

856
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,380
Let's go, everybody.

857
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,980
Don't worry, I shall be the bard.

858
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,400
I shall be the bard for this fight.

859
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh shit, now there's...

860
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:04,860
Okay.

861
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,980
Wait, I actually shoot these down.

862
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,760
Protect the golems.

863
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,420
Okay, but like, what about some sick music though?

864
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,640
Okay, I gotta actually save and protect the village.

865
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,180
Alright.

866
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,860
Okay, now...

867
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,080
Wait, they have enchantments on their bows?!

868
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,960
Don't worry.

869
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,020
I'm here to motivate you.

870
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,080
Wait, am I actually barding it up for him?

871
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,820
Bum-ba-dum-ba-da-dum.

872
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,880
Okay, I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm helping.

873
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,300
I swear.

874
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,460
I swear.

875
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,060
I swear to god, I'm helping.

876
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,460
I'm part of the team.

877
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,060
The support mindset.

878
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm helping now, guys.

879
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,740
I swear.

880
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,360
I swear, I'm part of the team, guys.

881
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,620
How long is this mini-game?

882
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,380
On some days, piglins or players will be buffed.

883
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,180
Oh, so like, some days it would be like, stronger.

884
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,020
We do a little trolling, just a little.

885
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,880
How long does this game mode end?

886
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,280
Can I just play music?

887
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,160
Oh, I guess like, it ends as much as you want to farm infinite.

888
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,320
Oh, there's an end?!

889
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,560
Wait, there's no end to this, so how do I leave?

890
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,080
Can I just leave whenever?

891
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,660
Can I just leave this army and desert them?

892
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,100
But like, how am I gonna get my Minecraft cape?

893
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,140
Wait, I'm stuck here forever?

894
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,560
But how do I get my Minecraft cape?

895
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,740
How do you finish this?

896
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,600
Wait, he's playing his little funky music.

897
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,720
Oh my god, no.

898
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
I killed him.

899
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,680
I killed him.

900
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,880
All he wanted to- Is that a gun?

901
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,620
How do you have a gun?

902
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,160
How do you have a gun in Minecraft?

903
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,460
Okay, quest.

904
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,420
Okay.

905
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,140
Wait, what is it?

906
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,700
Defend- Help each of the characters get the boot of swiftness wrestling room.

907
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,840
Um, ways to defend- Oh, I just have to defend at least- Oh, okay.

908
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,100
It's okay.

909
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I did one of them.

910
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,260
Wait, wait, wait.

911
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,720
Quest.

912
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,640
Oh, shit!

913
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,820
Wait, I can just exist.

914
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
They can defend for me.

915
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,920
I'll- I'll- Don't worry, guys.

916
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,120
I got this.

917
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,300
Don't worry- No!

918
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,900
Why do they hate music?

919
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,520
I don't understand.

920
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,290
Why do they hate music so much?

921
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,330
They get a warning sign.

922
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,570
They hate the part.

923
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,290
I just wanna play my funky song.

924
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,030
They target support first.

925
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,090
Wait, I think our knife guy quit his job.

926
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,130
I think he saw what I was doing.

927
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,270
Wait, what happened to knife man?

928
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,290
What happened to our- What happened to our barbarian?

929
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,610
Our tank?

930
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:26,670
He's gone.

931
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,050
He doesn't play for us anymore.

932
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,210
Our barbarian left.

933
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,170
Was it because of my music?

934
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,110
Did he not like my music?

935
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,930
I was born to be a bard, not an archer.

936
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,130
I just wanna play my music.

937
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,990
No, we lost our tank.

938
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,510
It's just a team full of archers now.

939
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,050
You were playing it in E minor.

940
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:01,210
No!

941
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,090
Oh shit!

942
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,950
Oh no!

943
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,230
Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

944
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,130
Guys, I can't take any more damage right now, guys.

945
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,170
Can you guys like finish the job?

946
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,350
I just need one more wave left.

947
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,970
Oh my god, there's like a medic center and everything.

948
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,970
Don't worry, I think my team can defend this.

949
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,710
I believe in them.

950
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,210
I'm gonna explore the village.

951
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,710
Don't worry, I'm just healing, guys.

952
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,530
I'm just healing.

953
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,270
Oh my god, they're- Oh my god, they're mining in fact and order.

954
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,910
Oh wait, we're both exploring the village here.

955
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,770
Don't worry.

956
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,030
Oh wait!

957
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:37,690
Oh shit!

958
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,210
Oh wait, wait, wait a minute.

959
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,150
Wait, I'm supposed to defend- Oh guys, guys, go down here!

960
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,170
Guys, no!

961
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,410
I have sightseeing!

962
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,450
We lost our warrior!

963
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,670
We lost our warrior!

964
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,350
It was not- I just wanted to explore.

965
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,090
I just wanted to explore the village.

966
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,750
It's okay, I just need two more- I just need them to defend two more- two more waves.

967
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,190
Guys, I don't know what happened.

968
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,990
We lost our tank and then everything went downhill somehow.

969
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:25,330
Somehow, like, apparently when your team comp doesn't have a tank, things just don't go as well.

970
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,410
This was my rank up game.

971
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,630
Don't worry.

972
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,670
Don't worry, I'm going in.

973
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,310
I shall be the next barbarian.

974
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,790
Wait, how do I go in though?

975
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,770
Wait a minute, instructions unclear.

976
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:40,910
How do you go down?

977
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:50,130
Wait, were you not supposed to- Wait a minute, did that guy bug his way downstairs and he were actually not supposed to go downstairs?

978
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,770
Because, like, how do you get down?

979
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:04,270
Took his already- Oh, it's an explo- it's an explo- oh shit!

980
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,490
Oh my god, okay.

981
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,550
I don't pay attention to the fact that people want to kill me.

982
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:13,510
Alright.

983
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,350
Oh, I just gotta eat it?

984
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,530
How do I get in?

985
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,350
I ate the chicken.

986
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,750
How do I get in?

987
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,030
I ate that chicken.

988
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,570
I wanna be part of the team.

989
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,550
How do I get in?

990
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,110
I'm eating it.

991
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,790
Where is it?

992
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,210
I wanna be part of the team!

993
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,010
Okay, I'll- I wanna- I wanna go down there!

994
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,590
I wanna be the next tank!

995
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,310
I wanna be the tank!

996
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,790
I'll be a hero!

997
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,330
Just like him!

998
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,730
Oh shit, oh shit.

999
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,550
Oh fu- Wait.

1000
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,070
Oh wait, no, I'm back in, I'm back in.

1001
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,190
Okay, sorry, I took fall damage.

1002
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,310
I got- actually, I took fall damage.

1003
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,950
Sorry, too late, guys.

1004
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,190
It's not fair!

1005
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,150
I just wanna go down there and beat people up.

1006
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,590
Is that too much to ask for?

1007
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,170
Get the bard.

1008
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,750
If I can't play music, he can't play music either.

1009
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,370
No one can play music.

1010
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,470
Music is banned in this area.

1011
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,150
Jason Momoa, save us.

1012
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:36,510
Okay.

1013
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,490
96 enemy kill, defense is 13%.

1014
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,270
Guys, please protect the island, please.

1015
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,550
No.

1016
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:48,650
No.

1017
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,610
I don't think I will.

1018
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,070
Why protect them when they can protect me?

1019
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,170
I'm just trying to figure out how to get down.

1020
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:03,270
He knows the strat- wait, okay, how do I- How do I, like, get downstairs?

1021
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,630
Guys, I'm trying to glitch it.

1022
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,670
I'm trying to glitch it right now.

1023
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,490
I'm eating my lava chicken.

1024
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,670
I'm playing my funky music.

1025
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,090
Naughty is ignoring comms.

1026
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:23,010
I'm not ignoring it, I'm choosing to not listen.

1027
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,070
That's different.

1028
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,170
The lower wall?

1029
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:27,630
Okay.

1030
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,150
Okay, we gotta get to the lower wall.

1031
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,810
Guys, I see it.

1032
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,470
I don't know how I'm trying to go down a ladder.

1033
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,550
Oh my god, is it because of the lava chicken?

1034
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,630
Let me- Guys, guys, I'm stuck.

1035
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,830
Oh, there you go, there you go.

1036
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,170
Alright, alright, how do we do it?

1037
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,790
How do we go down?

1038
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,110
I shall figure this out.

1039
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,990
How do we go down?

1040
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,430
Guys, I'm not trolling.

1041
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,070
I'm trying to be a hero.

1042
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:08,050
But to be a hero, I must get out of the- I must get out of the- Find a corner?

1043
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,290
Okay.

1044
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,430
I must get out of this village.

1045
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,670
Okay, find a corner.

1046
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,010
Okay.

1047
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,530
I'm finding a corner right now.

1048
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,330
Let me in.

1049
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,250
Let me in, let me in!

1050
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,510
I wanna go out!

1051
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,870
I wanna be an outside bird!

1052
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,310
Let me out, let me at him!

1053
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,170
Let me kill him!

1054
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:35,930
Please!

1055
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,210
I have the spirit!

1056
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,230
Please!

1057
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,410
Let me at him!

1058
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,270
I'll shoot this guy.

1059
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,670
Fuck this guy in particular.

1060
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:49,930
Alright.

1061
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,130
Fuck you.

1062
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,210
Get down from here.

1063
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,070
Nobody deserves to be in the sky.

1064
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,710
Oh, I'm an outside bird.

1065
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:59,150
I need outside.

1066
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,030
Oh hey, another one.

1067
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:03,670
Nice, $80.

1068
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:07,170
I can't believe people have $80 just lying around like that.

1069
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,270
Alright.

1070
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,410
I'm bugging in.

1071
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,370
I'm bugging in.

1072
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,110
Don't worry.

1073
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:16,990
I'm helping.

1074
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:22,510
Don't worry.

1075
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,010
Don't worry.

1076
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,090
I'm helping.

1077
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:27,450
Don't worry.

1078
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,690
The moment I get out, they will know.

1079
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:30,470
Guys.

1080
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,310
Is this not the lower ledge?

1081
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,690
Oh.

1082
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,070
Don't worry, I got this.

1083
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,550
I'm here.

1084
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,090
I'm here.

1085
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:44,750
Guys, did we win?

1086
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,710
Did we win, guys?

1087
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:51,630
Okay, don't worry.

1088
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,410
Next time.

1089
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,630
This time, I got it.

1090
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,470
The moment I figure out how to go outside, it's over.

1091
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:57,370
Guys.

1092
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,830
We just gotta figure out how to go outside.

1093
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,330
This time, for sure.

1094
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,030
Okay, this is upper.

1095
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,670
Is this lower?

1096
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,290
Is this here?

1097
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,170
Oh, shit.

1098
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:08,870
I might die.

1099
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,310
Is it here?

1100
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,410
I'm glitching.

1101
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,090
I'm glitching.

1102
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,010
I'm glitching.

1103
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,270
Wrong side?

1104
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,730
Oh, it's on the other side.

1105
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:16,690
Okay.

1106
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,470
Alright, let's go to the other side.

1107
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:21,530
Alright.

1108
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,190
Wait, wait, wait.

1109
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,670
Is it here?

1110
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,970
Is that, is that, was that it?

1111
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,610
That's going so fast.

1112
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:32,250
Oh, my God.

1113
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:36,940
Okay, no.

1114
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,420
Alright, no.

1115
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:38,960
Still no.

1116
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,210
Where is the lower edge?

1117
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,160
Where is that?

1118
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,980
Guys, I need a map.

1119
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,380
I need a, I need an explore map, guys.

1120
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,340
I won't be out there.

1121
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,780
Where the mobs are?

1122
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,460
Wait, what?

1123
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,920
Oh, next to the gate.

1124
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,240
Oh, here?

1125
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,840
This guy, this random guy that's not doing anything?

1126
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,080
Right here?

1127
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,620
Oh, my God.

1128
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,580
Where am I?

1129
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,460
Oh, my God.

1130
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:12,940
Right here?

1131
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,520
No.

1132
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,940
Face towards the enemy.

1133
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,820
Oh, the bow.

1134
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,320
Guys.

1135
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,140
Instructions are very unclear right now.

1136
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,620
Instructions are very unclear.

1137
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,240
Guys, please.

1138
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,020
Instructions very unclear.

1139
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,240
I'm trying my best.

1140
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,940
Oh, here.

1141
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,640
I'm glitching.

1142
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,040
I'm glitching.

1143
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,220
I'm glitching.

1144
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,220
Get me out.

1145
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,020
Okay, our army is pretty bad, not gonna lie.

1146
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,120
I'm trying.

1147
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,860
Please.

1148
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,620
Please.

1149
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,840
I almost made it.

1150
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,040
The moment I'm out of here, it's over.

1151
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,920
I will sleep when I'm out.

1152
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,160
Let me out.

1153
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,360
Let me out.

1154
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,160
We got to the one block.

1155
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,980
Wait, isn't this block right here?

1156
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,580
Oh, the center balcony.

1157
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:23,600
Here.

1158
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,860
Here, right here.

1159
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,720
Oh, my God, this is it.

1160
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,960
The moment I get out, it's over for them.

1161
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:32,900
It's over.

1162
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,380
Let me out of this invisible wall.

1163
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,540
I don't care if I get hit.

1164
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,920
Okay, maybe I do.

1165
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:37,680
All right.

1166
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,040
I'm gonna do it.

1167
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,000
I'm going in.

1168
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,080
The moment I get out, it's over.

1169
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,540
The moment I'm out of this jail.

1170
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,680
The moment I'm out of this jail, it's over for you.

1171
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,800
Get me out.

1172
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,520
Get me out of this invisible wall.

1173
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,080
Oh, he didn't crouch.

1174
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,340
Okay.

1175
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,720
It's gonna be so over for you.

1176
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,240
The moment I'm out of here.

1177
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,320
Oh, my God, our poor fucking golem.

1178
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,240
I'm just watching.

1179
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,840
I'm watching this all happen to him.

1180
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,000
Don't worry, sir.

1181
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,220
The moment I get out of here, I'll help.

1182
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,320
I swear to God.

1183
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,620
Don't worry.

1184
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,580
I'll be a hero soon.

1185
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,740
Don't worry, sir.

1186
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,000
I'll help you soon.

1187
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,860
Guys, that's crazy.

1188
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:50,040
Okay, I think our army might not be the best army.

1189
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,540
Get down and help him.

1190
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,460
Guys, I have important things to do right now.

1191
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,980
As in, I have to figure out how to...

1192
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,340
I'm trying to figure out how to glitch through.

1193
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,580
Please.

1194
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,120
Please, it's all I want.

1195
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,430
I just want...

1196
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,820
If only there was a bar to raise my morale.

1197
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,760
If only.

1198
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,320
Please, let me through.

1199
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,380
Let me through this stupid invisible wall.

1200
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,520
I am.

1201
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,560
I'm crouched.

1202
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,100
I'm so crouched.

1203
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,680
It won't let me glitch.

1204
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,420
I'm pressing every crouch button I have.

1205
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,580
Oh, here?

1206
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,780
Right here.

1207
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,680
This one.

1208
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,760
Is that one?

1209
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,060
Is this one?

1210
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,860
Get turned by the gate.

1211
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,960
Oh, this one.

1212
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,080
Oh, crouch after you start glitching.

1213
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,280
Okay, okay, okay.

1214
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,840
It's over!

1215
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,000
It's over for you.

1216
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:14,800
I'm stuck.

1217
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,420
Oh, wait.

1218
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,380
It's over.

1219
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,760
I'm stuck in this one corner, though.

1220
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,780
Don't worry.

1221
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,180
Don't worry.

1222
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,200
I'll save you.

1223
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,580
I'm just gonna get past the area.

1224
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,500
I'm stuck.

1225
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,180
I'll save you.

1226
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,860
I'll save you.

1227
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,700
Don't worry.

1228
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,920
Don't worry.

1229
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,470
Don't worry.

1230
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,830
Okay, I'm now stuck in this corner.

1231
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,230
No, no.

1232
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,590
I'm almost there.

1233
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,530
So far.

1234
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,170
Please, get closer.

1235
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,370
Please, get a little closer.

1236
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,670
Please, please.

1237
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,610
Get a little closer so I can help out.

1238
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,390
Guys, I swear to God.

1239
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,550
Guys, I'm helping.

1240
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,770
I swear to God.

1241
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,430
Guys, I just need to figure out how to get out of this one corner, please.

1242
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,690
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1243
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,510
Am I stuck here?

1244
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:38,710
Oh, shit.

1245
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,190
Guys, how do I get out of this wall?

1246
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,950
As you said, I can get out.

1247
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:50,970
How do I get out?

1248
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:51,170
I can't.

1249
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,190
This is my life now.

1250
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,150
No, I can't leave.

1251
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,430
It won't let me leave this.

1252
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,650
Oh, it's open.

1253
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,490
It's so open for all of you.

1254
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:10,770
That's right.

1255
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:13,070
I'm the tank now.

1256
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,090
That's right.

1257
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,590
It took me five.

1258
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:21,310
I watched five golems die for this.

1259
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,290
I'm tanking now, bitches.

1260
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,690
Get over here.

1261
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,630
That's a cute wreck.

1262
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,950
I am a hero.

1263
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,130
He's dead.

1264
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,070
You don't get to play music in my lobby.

1265
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,330
Only I get to play music.

1266
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,590
Oh my god, we gotta help this man.

1267
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,250
Don't worry, I'm coming over to help you.

1268
00:57:52,410 --> 00:58:01,150
Oh man, there was no one there.

1269
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,730
That was weird.

1270
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,670
There was no one there, guys.

1271
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:05,790
That was so weird.

1272
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,830
Don't worry, the hero is here.

1273
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:11,990
Wait, they don't know what to do.

1274
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,590
This is actually crazy.

1275
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,330
They don't know what to do.

1276
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,290
They're like, you're not supposed to be out of the gates.

1277
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,610
That's fucking right.

1278
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:21,950
That's right.

1279
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,310
Get out of here.

1280
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,430
I shall be the hero the village deserves.

1281
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,670
I ate so many chickens to get here.

1282
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,190
That's right, leave.

1283
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:34,870
Leave.

1284
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,090
Watch this, though.

1285
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,580
Is he doing it?

1286
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,800
Oh, shit.

1287
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,400
Okay, I should help him now.

1288
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,680
Oh, no, don't die.

1289
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,720
I'm sorry.

1290
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:56,900
No.

1291
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,800
I was playing too much funky music.

1292
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,740
That music was too funky.

1293
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,940
Don't laugh.

1294
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,040
Look what you've done.

1295
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,760
I'm sorry.

1296
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,080
I just wanted to play some silly songs.

1297
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,760
I wanted to be a bard.

1298
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:25,020
I told mama I just wanna be a bard.

1299
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,520
But mama said, no, you were born to fight like a man.

1300
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,560
I'm like, mama.

1301
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,700
But mama, look at this sick-ass tune.

1302
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,920
Born in the wrong class.

1303
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,800
Look at that.

1304
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,580
I told you I can be a hero.

1305
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,560
Did I finish my quest?

1306
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,380
Oh, yes, I did.

1307
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,880
And that's it, right?

1308
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,280
Alright.

1309
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,160
Is there anything else in my quest?

1310
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,280
Gas killed.

1311
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,610
Wait, piglin reinforcements have arrived.

1312
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,420
Wait, do I get Steve?

1313
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,740
Oh, I can get like a battle cry.

1314
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:16,780
Wait, what?

1315
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:17,920
Okay.

1316
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,300
Enemies.

1317
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:19,800
The fight.

1318
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,260
Make sure it stays that way.

1319
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,660
Oh, I get a mushroom hat.

1320
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,960
What's number four?

1321
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,040
Protect the traitor's route.

1322
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,860
Oh, Cadouche.

1323
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,820
Wait, I want the Cadouche emote, actually.

1324
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,140
Wait, the Cadouche emote is pretty sick, not gonna lie.

1325
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,060
Oh, I want a Cadouche.

1326
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,300
Okay, to get the jetpack dressing room.

1327
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,520
Way is cleared with at least two iron golems alive.

1328
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,300
Oh, that's awkward.

1329
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:48,920
That's pretty awkward.

1330
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,600
That's pretty awkward.

1331
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,620
Um, you know, maybe I should have stopped playing my music.

1332
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,000
All right, you guys are on your own now.

1333
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,440
All right, the tank is leaving.

1334
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,140
Good luck.

1335
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,020
The tank is leaving.

1336
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,080
I'm going back home.

1337
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,880
Wait, I could have tried the portals.

1338
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:16,860
I forgot.

1339
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,220
Oh my God.

1340
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,520
Wait, yeah, you guys said the portals work, right?

1341
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,260
No!

1342
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,200
The tank left.

1343
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,340
I forgot about the portals.

1344
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,840
Okay, how's the sound, by the way?

1345
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,240
Is the sound okay?

1346
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,400
The tank has left the game.

1347
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,360
Wait, I'm gonna try switching over again.

1348
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,100
All right, don't worry, the tank is back.

1349
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,820
The tank is back.

1350
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,420
I know how to do it this time.

1351
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,340
Get me in there.

1352
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,240
Yes.

1353
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,620
Get me in there.

1354
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
I'm ready to tank.

1355
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,900
Now, the tank has left.

1356
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,040
Now, what do we do?

1357
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,680
I mean, this team fucking sucks.

1358
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,240
It's just a team full of Widowmakers.

1359
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,700
Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do with that?

1360
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,980
Wait, the door didn't load in.

1361
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,720
Wait, the door didn't load in.

1362
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,120
Oh.

1363
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,320
No!

1364
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,020
All right, I can do this again.

1365
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,940
I figured it out.

1366
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,220
Oh my god, the first try!

1367
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,380
Look at that.

1368
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,920
Okay, this one doesn't work.

1369
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,440
For that first fucking try, guys.

1370
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,100
Doing this, though.

1371
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,600
Okay, not this one.

1372
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,060
Does this one work?

1373
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,060
Oh, wait, no?

1374
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,240
Apparently, one of the portals work, right?

1375
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,700
He'll figure this out.

1376
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,700
Fuck you, though.

1377
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,160
Get down from here, you don't deserve to be in the sky.

1378
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,340
It's one of the small ones?

1379
01:02:59,440 --> 01:02:59,960
This one?

1380
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,140
Oh my god, wait.

1381
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,340
Am I going to the nether?

1382
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,220
I just...

1383
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,460
I just separately went to the nether.

1384
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:15,700
Wait.

1385
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:21,320
Am I generating a world in my... in the special worlds?

1386
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,840
Oh my god, where am I?

1387
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,760
Where the fuck...

1388
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,160
Where the fuck am I?

1389
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,460
I'm in a separate nether right now.

1390
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,760
Wait, can I die?

1391
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,120
Oh, wait, I can't die.

1392
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,400
I actually generated some random fucking nether.

1393
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,080
I broke...

1394
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,040
I broke the world.

1395
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,100
Wait, can I like...

1396
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,960
Wait, I can't even die from the lava.

1397
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,220
Can I mine any of this?

1398
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,920
Wait, I can't... where am I?

1399
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,740
Where did I... where did I go?

1400
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,400
The gate...

1401
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,280
Okay, but like...

1402
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,820
Why the gate when I'm in this cool...

1403
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,140
Why the gate when I'm in their home...

1404
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,680
I'm in their home territory.

1405
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,020
I'm in their base.

1406
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,960
I'm trying to find their base right now.

1407
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,300
I'm going undercover.

1408
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,660
This is so much more important than the gate right now.

1409
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,680
This is like...

1410
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,600
Like I'm on an actual mission.

1411
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,380
I'm invading their fortress.

1412
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,220
I'm gonna be the one invading their homes and destroying their gates.

1413
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,720
The after credits scene.

1414
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:38,560
Can't believe I created the nether in this.

1415
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,510
I wonder if there's like enemies spawning here.

1416
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:48,710
I don't think it was meant...

1417
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,470
I don't think they were like...

1418
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,050
It was meant to be coded in.

1419
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,250
Now this is just reg...

1420
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,990
This is just regular Minecraft where I can't do anything at all.

1421
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,690
We're gonna...

1422
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,810
We're gonna find the fortress, guys.

1423
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:06,210
Yeah, nothing is spawning here.

1424
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,450
It's only just like buildings and stuff.

1425
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:09,610
That's cr...

1426
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,750
Wait, there's a gold block.

1427
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:12,230
Wait, what the fuck?

1428
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:14,830
I wanna get up there.

1429
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,450
Wait, there's something up there.

1430
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:18,130
Do you see that?

1431
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:20,870
The fuck is that?

1432
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:25,790
Where am I?

1433
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,730
Swim up...

1434
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:29,750
Wait, you're right.

1435
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,170
I can swim up a lot.

1436
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,790
Oh, wait, what is this?

1437
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,010
Wait, that's a giant ass...

1438
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,290
Wait, is that natural?

1439
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,130
What is this?

1440
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,370
Is this a ruined portal?

1441
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,830
Why is the ruined portal so fucking big?

1442
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:47,190
Are they supposed to be that big?

1443
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,230
I thought they were, like, smaller.

1444
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,410
Oh, I didn't realize there was, like, big ruined...

1445
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,130
Oh, I didn't realize there was a...

1446
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:00,730
There were big ruined portals here.

1447
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:02,950
Oh.

1448
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:05,710
That's interesting.

1449
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,530
Let's see if I can find, like...

1450
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,050
Wait, I can't get hurt here, too.

1451
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,750
Yes, guys, you...

1452
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,250
Oh my god, I found a for...

1453
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,810
Wait, this is like...

1454
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,610
Wait, I found a fortress, guys.

1455
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:22,350
Oh my god, guys.

1456
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,530
We can go to the ender dragon, everyone.

1457
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:25,230
Let's go.

1458
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,410
Let's go.

1459
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,810
Let's get some blazer eyes and go to the ender.

1460
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:36,110
The fastest fucking fortress find of my life.

1461
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,190
Why couldn't it be this easy?

1462
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:42,150
Faster than last time.

1463
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:46,730
Why couldn't it be this easy, guys?

1464
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:48,650
Wait, how am I getting damaged by fire?

1465
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:50,870
Okay, but I can't mine in this world.

1466
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,190
How do I get out?

1467
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,390
How do I get in?

1468
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,070
Can I get in through here?

1469
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:57,930
Oh, I can.

1470
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,790
Wow, this is a very peaceful fortress.

1471
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:04,470
I like how nothing spawns here at all.

1472
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,570
Wait, I can't even get through this.

1473
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,930
There's not even chests or anything.

1474
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,130
It just exists to exist.

1475
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,250
I'm just naturally...

1476
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,130
Oh my god, okay.

1477
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,230
Alright, is there anything down here?

1478
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,850
Like, there's nothing here but chests.

1479
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:24,990
It's so...

1480
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,430
Like, it's so...

1481
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:28,790
Okay, it's a little spooky that like...

1482
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,070
It's so quiet.

1483
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,170
Oh, there's a chest!

1484
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:31,770
No!

1485
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:36,730
It wouldn't even let me open the chest!

1486
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,370
That's so fucked up.

1487
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:40,010
That's actually...

1488
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:41,070
I gotta leave now.

1489
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:41,990
Wait.

1490
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,910
I can't leave.

1491
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,610
Oh my god, I'm stuck here forever.

1492
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,010
Wait.

1493
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,130
Wait, it won't let me leave.

1494
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,070
Oh my god, I broke the game.

1495
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,730
I can't even play my music.

1496
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,890
Oh my god, I broke it.

1497
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,410
This is my new home.

1498
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,910
I don't think I was supposed to be here, guys.

1499
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:11,010
Oh no.

1500
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:12,790
No.

1501
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,450
I'm stuck here forever.

1502
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:18,670
They're like, Doki, you do not belong here.

1503
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:20,610
Leave this place now.

1504
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,430
Oh.

1505
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:25,090
Guys.

1506
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,850
I think I broke the simulation.

1507
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:30,330
I...

1508
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:35,740
Guys.

1509
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,820
I think they found out.

1510
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,340
I think they found out I went off the grid, guys.

1511
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,140
I am the edge of the world.

1512
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,160
I found the edge of Minecraft.

1513
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,100
I am Doki.

1514
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,580
Doki had it again.

1515
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,580
I found the edge of the world.

1516
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,720
Now where do I...

1517
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,240
Wait.

1518
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,720
I can't swim up.

1519
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:06,960
Wait.

1520
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,080
I'm stuck down here.

1521
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,800
I'm stuck down here.

1522
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,820
Oh my god.

1523
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,180
Wait a minute.

1524
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,000
If I...

1525
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,640
Can I...

1526
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,660
Will it respawn me back in the main menu?

1527
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,200
Or am I back in the other world?

1528
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,660
This is how I've rested in peace since.

1529
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,350
They put me back in...

1530
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,230
Oh my god, thank god.

1531
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:34,550
Okay.

1532
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:35,610
That was crazy.

1533
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,050
Okay.

1534
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,030
That was a little freaky.

1535
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,670
I was actually stuck in the...

1536
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,850
I was actually...

1537
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,650
I thought I could never leave.

1538
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:47,270
Oh, thanks Jack Black.

1539
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,590
How much was the head?

1540
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:50,770
I wanna buy the head.

1541
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,250
Rest in peace, Sans.

1542
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,010
Alright, where's the...

1543
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,010
Okay, it's right over here.

1544
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,390
How much is it?

1545
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,570
I wanna be a little piglin.

1546
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:03,890
800...

1547
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,370
No, I was so close!

1548
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,270
Also, what the fuck do we do with this?

1549
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,490
Like, do we get a house?

1550
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,870
Oh, there's a bucket hat?

1551
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,650
Alright, next mission.

1552
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,770
Let's go to the next one.

1553
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:21,170
I just wanna be a little piglin.

1554
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,810
So I can like...

1555
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:24,370
So I can...

1556
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:27,010
Breach the inner fortress.

1557
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,750
I can be like a double agent.

1558
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:31,190
Oh, there's this kid.

1559
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:33,230
From Stranger Things.

1560
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,790
He's a Stranger Things kid, right?

1561
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,100
We're very low on supplies, so glad you come to bring us back.

1562
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,700
It's just a short hop outside the village.

1563
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,140
Okay.

1564
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,440
Enter wilderness.

1565
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,080
He looks like a Stranger Things kid, not gonna lie.

1566
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:03,550
I see child, and I'm like, you must have been from Stranger Things.

1567
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,270
Oh, it's to protect the minecart.

1568
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,610
Let's check something real quick.

1569
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:09,870
Okay.

1570
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:12,850
Oh wait, I have to reload the...

1571
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,630
God damn it!

1572
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,050
I tabbed out at the reload!

1573
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,690
I forgot!

1574
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,330
Bedrock is so weird.

1575
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,790
If you tab out...

1576
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:27,430
If you tab out the game, you have to like reload the world.

1577
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,290
God damn it.

1578
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:29,970
I wanna check out what that was.

1579
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,250
Okay.

1580
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,290
I'm fast traveling.

1581
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,890
Can't be bothered.

1582
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,110
Get me in the wilderness.

1583
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:41,030
I'm not using my legs to walk over there.

1584
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:41,870
That's what not...

1585
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:42,530
That's...

1586
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,210
Legs are not meant for that.

1587
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,690
That's not what legs are for.

1588
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,490
Alright.

1589
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,170
No, I missed the tutorial!

1590
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,030
No!

1591
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,840
What am I supposed to do?

1592
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,100
Play my music.

1593
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:06,900
The fuck?

1594
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:07,940
Payload cart.

1595
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,580
What am I supposed to do?

1596
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,400
What are they doing?

1597
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,400
Oh, we're escorting this guy.

1598
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,280
If there's two people, does it go faster?

1599
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,420
Okay, let's escort them into the piglets.

1600
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,500
My bad, guys.

1601
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,420
I may have accidentally escorted him to the...

1602
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,600
Fuck you.

1603
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,860
I'm killing your boyfriend too.

1604
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:31,940
Alright, let's escort it.

1605
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,420
Alright, actual intended cart.

1606
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:36,840
Okay.

1607
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,520
Oh, so we can go straight ahead.

1608
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,380
Oh my god, there's the pillagers.

1609
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:41,860
Get out of here.

1610
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,740
Get out of here.

1611
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,240
Wait, wait a minute.

1612
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,060
I might be dying.

1613
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,360
Wait, how do I heal?

1614
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:48,800
Oh my god.

1615
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,360
Okay, guys.

1616
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,880
This will protect me.

1617
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,980
I'll use this to body block.

1618
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:54,940
Okay, nice.

1619
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,240
Alright.

1620
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:57,780
Protecting the cart.

1621
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,320
Okay, like, let me look at my quest.

1622
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,080
I need Kadoosh.

1623
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,560
Which one was Kadoosh?

1624
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,380
Okay, cart at least...

1625
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:06,500
Forty...

1626
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,460
Three times!

1627
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,020
Oh my god, do this three times.

1628
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,160
Okay, it's gonna be worth it, guys.

1629
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:12,700
I can Kadoosh it.

1630
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,800
Okay, where else would it spawn?

1631
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,720
If I move ahead, then I can, like, fight them in advance.

1632
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:20,200
Right?

1633
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,640
Or do they, like, spawn in later?

1634
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,380
Oh, they, like, spawn in later.

1635
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,940
Oh, because they're, like, portals.

1636
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,040
Portaling in.

1637
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,080
Oh, I see.

1638
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,680
That's why everybody was moving ahead.

1639
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:35,700
Okay.

1640
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,480
Where else would they go?

1641
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:38,960
Wait, there's a mine here.

1642
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,600
Oh my god.

1643
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,600
There's $80.

1644
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,480
Oh my god, I can wear a pig.

1645
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,100
Oh my god, I can wear a piglin hat.

1646
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,700
Wait, how do you get an axe?

1647
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,680
All I have is a fucking sword.

1648
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,940
Wait, is this the end goal?

1649
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,720
Yay, we made it!

1650
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,260
Yay!

1651
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,500
Alright, go, go, go, go.

1652
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,220
Faster, faster.

1653
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,060
There's two people.

1654
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,680
Three on payload, guys!

1655
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,200
Three on payload!

1656
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,000
Come on, everyone!

1657
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,540
If there's more people, there's more payload.

1658
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,960
There's more speed.

1659
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,600
Guys, I need my kadouche.

1660
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:17,120
Guys.

1661
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:17,740
Oh, fuck.

1662
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,580
Wait, there's an actual chicken jockey.

1663
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,540
Oh my god, there's an...

1664
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,220
Wait, there's an actual chicken jockey.

1665
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,860
Wait, they...

1666
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,360
They exist.

1667
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,160
Wait, what is he doing in the village?

1668
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,760
What is he...

1669
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,960
What's that?

1670
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,080
What was he doing in the village?

1671
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:37,980
Chicken jockey.

1672
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,520
Chicken jockey.

1673
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,300
There's a fucking random ass chicken jockey here.

1674
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:43,860
Guys, come on.

1675
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,160
Three on payload, guys.

1676
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,700
Come on, everybody.

1677
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,700
We all know that.

1678
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,000
Let me get all...

1679
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,680
Let me get...

1680
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,300
Wait, wait.

1681
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,920
Now I know why there was no one on payload.

1682
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,280
Alright, guys.

1683
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,300
Let me speed the payload over to the next enemy, guys.

1684
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,600
I'm helping.

1685
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:05,680
Guys, I may or may not have not been helping with that.

1686
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,920
Okay, the cart's okay.

1687
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,540
Alright, guys.

1688
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,280
Look at that.

1689
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,440
I'm speeding the payload to the next enemy, guys.

1690
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,260
Don't worry.

1691
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,420
Don't worry, everybody.

1692
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,940
Don't let anything...

1693
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,480
That's right.

1694
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,760
I'm not letting anything stand in my way.

1695
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,000
Alright, don't worry.

1696
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,720
The payload's here, guys.

1697
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,720
The payload's also here again.

1698
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,600
Oh, man.

1699
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,020
It's so unlucky that there were people dead.

1700
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:37,420
Oh, my God.

1701
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,300
There's a chicken jockey.

1702
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:40,680
Alright.

1703
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,820
Don't worry, guys.

1704
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,980
I got payload duty.

1705
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,500
I'm pushing the payload.

1706
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,460
I'm on Lucio.

1707
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,840
I'm the Lucio cart, baby.

1708
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:54,840
Okay.

1709
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,080
Helping.

1710
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:56,960
I need Kadoosh.

1711
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,820
I need to Kadoosh it.

1712
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:00,500
Alright.

1713
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,240
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

1714
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:03,360
Come on.

1715
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,220
Move, move, move, move.

1716
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:04,660
Get there.

1717
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,000
Alright.

1718
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,260
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1719
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,600
Go, go, go, llamas.

1720
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:07,960
Go.

1721
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,160
Come on.

1722
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,000
Go, go, go.

1723
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,300
Go into the piglins.

1724
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,160
I wish, like, the cart can run them over.

1725
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,460
What the fuck?

1726
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,580
Oh, I completed the quest.

1727
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,740
Oh, nice.

1728
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,860
Oh, because I killed 200 people.

1729
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,260
Can I wear my hat?

1730
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,960
Wait, I want to wear my cool hat.

1731
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,860
How do I wear it?

1732
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,720
Oh, it's in the dressing room.

1733
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,300
Oh, I can't because I have my Sans hat.

1734
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:42,140
Apparently, if you have your regular skins, you can't wear hats.

1735
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,040
What's the point?

1736
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:48,180
What's the point if I can't even wear a hat on Sans?

1737
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,360
Don't worry, I got you.

1738
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,120
I got you, llama.

1739
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,540
I just need one more.

1740
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,660
I just need one more.

1741
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,520
Come on.

1742
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,100
How far is the point?

1743
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,700
I'm doing this for Kadoosh.

1744
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,800
Oh, wait, we're here.

1745
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:05,980
Nevermind, we did it.

1746
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:06,560
Yippee!

1747
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,200
What's the point if we can't be...

1748
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:12,920
I know, right?

1749
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,260
What's the point if I can't put a hat on Sans?

1750
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,380
Yay!

1751
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,580
87.

1752
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,480
203!

1753
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,500
I did it.

1754
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,480
I did that.

1755
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,400
Wait, you can earn money from this a lot faster than, uh...

1756
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,620
than, like, the other mission.

1757
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:30,600
Yay!

1758
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:31,940
Alright.

1759
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,260
Go.

1760
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,820
Go do the thing.

1761
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:37,940
Oh, he's AFK.

1762
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,120
I just realized I don't actually have to be there to complete the mission.

1763
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,640
Oh, what if I kill them from behind?

1764
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,440
Do they spawn from behind?

1765
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,760
Let me check.

1766
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,480
I'm actually curious.

1767
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,440
L-l-l-l-lava.

1768
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,840
Ch-ch-ch-chicken.

1769
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,120
Lava chicken.

1770
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,520
I'm checking if anything spawns from behind.

1771
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,900
Oh, it doesn't.

1772
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,320
Okay, so you have to...

1773
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,760
You actually have to, like...

1774
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,360
It spawns when the cart is closer or the next enemy or some shit.

1775
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,920
I go from the back.

1776
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:11,780
Oh, money!

1777
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:12,840
Money!

1778
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:15,260
Yippee!

1779
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:17,760
Money!

1780
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,940
Wait, someone... you can die?

1781
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,820
Wait, you can die in this game?

1782
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,640
How do you die from the Vex?

1783
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,640
Where am I?

1784
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,700
Okay, this is...

1785
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,440
Where did I go in this adventure?

1786
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,660
Do you think my cart's okay?

1787
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,180
It's fine, right?

1788
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,700
Yeah, it should be fine.

1789
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,010
Wait, what if I...

1790
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,350
Oh, hey.

1791
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:54,770
Are you helping too?

1792
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,510
Okay, these portals don't work.

1793
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:59,650
Don't worry, I'm helping!

1794
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:03,570
Don't worry, guys.

1795
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,830
Where is the cart?

1796
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,070
Where did the cart go?

1797
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:09,990
Wait, guys?

1798
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:11,530
Where is our cart?

1799
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:13,270
Guys?

1800
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,850
Oh shit, there's a battle axe?

1801
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:20,850
Wait, that's where you got it?

1802
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,210
Wait, I found it.

1803
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:24,390
It's time.

1804
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,600
They need you.

1805
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,860
Yeah, but where is...

1806
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,200
Okay.

1807
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:35,740
I can't help if I don't even know where the cart is, guys.

1808
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:40,420
How am I supposed to help if I don't even know where it is?

1809
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,940
Where even am I now?

1810
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,600
Okay, this is the base.

1811
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,960
Oh, there it is.

1812
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,060
Wait, did they fail?

1813
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,820
Wait, did you guys fail?

1814
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:53,660
Guys!

1815
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,320
No, wait, no, that's...

1816
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:55,820
Oh wait, never mind.

1817
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,060
No, that's the NPCs.

1818
01:19:59,240 --> 01:19:59,900
Oh, what?

1819
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,000
Wait, but where's the cart?

1820
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:07,840
It's all the way here?

1821
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,460
Wait, is it the blue line over there?

1822
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,780
Guys, where did the cart go?

1823
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:13,580
What?

1824
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:19,460
Oh, is that where the cart is?

1825
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,680
How did it get over there?

1826
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,780
Okay, I'm heading over.

1827
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,500
Don't worry.

1828
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,680
I shall be the hero.

1829
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,900
Okay, the cart can't be that badly damaged, right?

1830
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:41,110
Alright, I guess it just walked, doki.

1831
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,350
Oh my god, it's so far.

1832
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:49,770
Is there anyone still alive over there?

1833
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,040
I think I went too far.

1834
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,960
Oh see, everybody's fine!

1835
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,720
Look at that!

1836
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,120
Look at that!

1837
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,800
Nothing to worry about and I got battle...

1838
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,560
Oh my god, wait.

1839
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,760
They have magic now.

1840
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,600
Oh shit.

1841
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,580
Don't worry, I'm helping.

1842
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,100
I'm helping.

1843
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,140
Wait, oh my god, they have swords?

1844
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,100
What, these tiny guys have swords?

1845
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,900
Oh my god!

1846
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,220
Oh my god!

1847
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,640
Okay, this one's a lot harder.

1848
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,020
This one's a lot harder.

1849
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,560
When did they give them swords?

1850
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,400
Look how tiny their swords are!

1851
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,240
Look how tiny their fucking swords are!

1852
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,160
Oh no.

1853
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,860
Oh no, guys.

1854
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,380
Guys, this does not look...

1855
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,840
Guys, I don't think I'm getting Caduceus.

1856
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,660
Guys, I don't think...

1857
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,020
Guys, the Vex are destroying our cart.

1858
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,680
They upgraded.

1859
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,000
Oh my god.

1860
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,620
Like, they gave them tiny ass swords.

1861
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,060
That's crazy.

1862
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,320
You might as well give them a fucking gun.

1863
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,360
Oh my god, imagine them holding miniature guns.

1864
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,360
Jesus Christ, it hits so hard.

1865
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,980
Guys, it's less than 40%.

1866
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:13,920
Let the cart die.

1867
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,120
What's the point?

1868
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,900
What's the point?

1869
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,420
You know, like, when I wasn't there, they were winning, guys.

1870
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,680
I should have explored the map a little more.

1871
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:28,380
All I'm

1872
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,870
saying is that maybe...

1873
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:38,330
Maybe I shouldn't have come back to help.

1874
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:47,290
All I'm saying is that when I wasn't there, we were winning.

1875
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:50,890
Holy fuck.

1876
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,910
Okay, this one is a lot harder.

1877
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:55,870
Like, give me back the easier level.

1878
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:02,410
Okay, who's playing their saxophone?

1879
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:06,030
If I can't play the saxophone, you can't play the saxophone.

1880
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:12,230
Why do we have to start back at the hard level, though?

1881
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,090
This level is so hard.

1882
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,890
They have, like, guys with mini swords.

1883
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:20,370
My team fucking sucks, man.

1884
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,430
We're so far.

1885
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,010
I'm leaving.

1886
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,030
You know what?

1887
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:24,570
Fuck this.

1888
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:25,670
I'm leaving this team.

1889
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,150
You're on your own.

1890
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,370
I'm re-rolling my team.

1891
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:33,990
I'm gonna re-roll my team, guys.

1892
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:36,010
All right, go back to the video.

1893
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:36,450
Go back to the village.

1894
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,630
This team sucks.

1895
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:44,270
I'm leaving and re-queuing.

1896
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:55,380
Look, my team fucking sucked, okay?

1897
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:56,980
Also, I'm gonna buy the hat.

1898
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,380
Doki, you're gonna get a penalty for leaving.

1899
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,220
Doki, no!

1900
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:03,540
All right.

1901
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,780
You wanna be a villager or...

1902
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,380
Oh, my gosh.

1903
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,860
A villager or...

1904
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,520
A piglin.

1905
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,700
No, I'll be a villager.

1906
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,380
Guys,

1907
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:47,050
I'm just like him.

1908
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:49,710
Oh, I can buy a guitar.

1909
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:52,250
Wait, why buy an acoustic when I can get a bass guitar?

1910
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:56,630
That's right.

1911
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:00,050
The Sans Jam session right here.

1912
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,510
That's where I can start my own band.

1913
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,550
Fuck, I need the Cadouche, though.

1914
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:12,590
I'm only...

1915
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:15,750
I just need my cart to, like, survive for one more map.

1916
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:16,850
One more round.

1917
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:18,610
Okay, let's see.

1918
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:21,530
Oh, no, not the quest.

1919
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:23,390
Uh...

1920
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,230
Wilderness.

1921
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,250
Look, it's a bass guitar, okay, guys?

1922
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,070
It's not a...

1923
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,930
I know it's a little quiet, but, like...

1924
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:39,250
But, like, it's the little things.

1925
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:40,890
It's the small impact I make.

1926
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:42,090
Wait, I'm back here.

1927
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:43,770
Wait, why is the...

1928
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:45,230
Why am I back in this area?

1929
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:48,190
This level was so fucking hard for Payload.

1930
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,270
Oh, my God.

1931
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:51,310
I'm re-rolling.

1932
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:52,190
I'm...

1933
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:56,870
They're never gonna finish this level!

1934
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,170
This level is too difficult!

1935
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:03,370
Okay.

1936
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,530
It's the same choke point.

1937
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:09,150
Alright, I'll come back later.

1938
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:16,030
That choke point is way too hard.

1939
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:21,390
They have the Vex and those mini-swords fucking hurt.

1940
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,590
Alright.

1941
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:27,410
Uh...

1942
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,250
I wanna check...

1943
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,450
Oh, hey, there's another dog.

1944
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:30,050
Aww.

1945
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,590
Oh, he's eating a little bone.

1946
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:33,790
Oh, that's cute.

1947
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:37,330
Okay, where's the one I haven't done?

1948
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:38,030
I've done...

1949
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,590
I've done this level.

1950
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,590
I've done this one.

1951
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:44,730
Where's the, uh...

1952
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:45,730
Oh, the one back here!

1953
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:46,310
Right?

1954
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:47,290
Yeah.

1955
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,210
Oh, my God.

1956
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:51,050
Hey, I have one, too.

1957
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:53,470
Let's create a band.

1958
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:57,270
Let's go.

1959
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,930
See?

1960
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:02,750
Even through our differences, we can create music to get there.

1961
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:03,370
Oh, my God.

1962
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,710
He's holding a balloon like it's fucking Disneyland.

1963
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:07,130
He's like, Yippee!

1964
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,750
Minecraft Land!

1965
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:12,430
Yippee!

1966
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:14,510
Happiest place on Earth!

1967
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,070
Hehehe.

1968
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,230
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

1969
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,590
Alright.

1970
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,630
Let's see.

1971
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:26,750
I have to head over to...

1972
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,290
Oh, my God.

1973
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:28,070
He's just sweeping.

1974
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:28,910
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1975
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,210
Alright, last minigame, guys.

1976
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:34,170
Last one.

1977
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,780
What minigame is this one?

1978
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,140
Are you the reinforcements?

1979
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,640
I'm he...

1980
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,100
Oh, wait.

1981
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:45,420
Yeah.

1982
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,460
I'll come along.

1983
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:48,800
What do I do here?

1984
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:57,150
It's sweeping time.

1985
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:58,070
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1986
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:00,130
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1987
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:04,370
Alright.

1988
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,830
Found a way down into the mine.

1989
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,230
We're collecting village defense resources.

1990
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,410
Hop on elevators to get different levels.

1991
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,030
Oh, my God.

1992
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:19,230
Did you guys hear that the director of Chainsaw Man made a Roblox world?

1993
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,910
They made a horror...

1994
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:26,630

1995
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:28,690

I was so looking forward to it, too.

2177
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:41,230
God damn it.

2178
01:45:41,310 --> 01:45:41,910
It's not out yet.

2179
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:42,950
It says coming soon.

2180
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:44,750
I thought it was out now.

2181
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,490
Not yet, but there.

2182
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:47,290
This is what it...

2183
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:53,610
is basically the director of Chainsaw Man is literally making a Roblox map right now.

2184
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:58,990
I just think it's funny that at the beginning of the level, you see three Roblox guys.

2185
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:02,250
Three Roblox guys.

2186
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:03,990
Just chilling.

2187
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:06,070
Yeah, that's so...

2188
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:08,330
Why does this look so good?

2189
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:11,250
It's the next generation of gaming, guys.

2190
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,390
Roblox.

2191
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:14,190
Okay, log in.

2192
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:16,870
Shit, I don't know what...

2193
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,030
Okay, I think this was my...

2194
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:18,750
Is this my username?

2195
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:19,730
I don't remember.

2196
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:20,350
It's been a while.

2197
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:22,150
No!

2198
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:25,810
What's the point if I can't play?

2199
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:27,510
Guys.

2200
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:32,610
What's the point if I can't even...

2201
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:37,810
If I can't even play the scary game I wanted?

2202
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:38,950
You know what I wanna play?

2203
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:39,870
Let's do this one.

2204
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:40,790
Alright.

2205
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,510
Since we're playing children games.

2206
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:44,970
Since we're...

2207
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:46,330
Since we're...

2208
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:46,750
Alright.

2209
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:50,510
Let's do this one real quick before we call it here today.

2210
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,970
Because I have a second stream later.

2211
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:55,590
Alright, I'm starting Roblox.

2212
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:57,390
Don't worry, I have another good one.

2213
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:58,370
Guys.

2214
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:00,270
I have another good one for you guys.

2215
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:13,000
Do you guys hear it?

2216
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:15,880
The gunshots.

2217
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,420
Do you guys hear the gunshots?

2218
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,320
You know where we're at right now.

2219
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,600
Wait, why is it not showing up?

2220
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,060
Oh my god.

2221
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,940
Guys, why is my Roblox not capturing, guys?

2222
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,700
Oh my god.

2223
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,340
Is this...

2224
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:35,520
Okay, I remember now.

2225
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:37,360
Okay.

2226
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:38,720
Roblox.

2227
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,980
I forgot it requires this.

2228
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:42,920
Don't worry.

2229
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,540
By the way, I'm Thomas the Tank Engine now.

2230
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:54,640
Are you five?

2231
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,040
Yes, I five.

2232
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:12,980
He's five, guys.

2233
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:14,520
I wanna play.

2234
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,240
I wanna play.

2235
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,340
Let me in.

2236
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,580
Let me in.

2237
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:24,180
Let me in, everyone.

2238
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,840
I wanna play.

2239
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,000
Die.

2240
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:27,960
Please.

2241
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,640
I could've saved you.

2242
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,280
Please, just die.

2243
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:36,460
I wanna join the games.

2244
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:42,450
I'm actually five dudes in a trench coat.

2245
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:46,290
Oh, wait.

2246
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:47,410
Waiting for players.

2247
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:48,490
Wait, that's me.

2248
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:49,370
That's me.

2249
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:50,050
I'm players.

2250
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:51,790
Wait, that's me.

2251
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:52,310
Let me in.

2252
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:52,710
Let me in.

2253
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:53,110
Let me in.

2254
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:53,530
Let me in.

2255
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:54,030
Let me in.

2256
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:55,330
Oh, no.

2257
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:56,250
They're waiting for these guys.

2258
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:58,070
They're all still alive?

2259
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,250
Kill them.

2260
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:05,590
Oh, yeah.

2261
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:09,550
How do they get in?

2262
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,710
How do we get in?

2263
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:12,970
Oh, the game started in 40 seconds.

2264
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:13,830
Alright, guys.

2265
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:15,310
Oh my...

2266
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:15,730
What?

2267
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:19,210
Why are you so tall?

2268
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:23,550
Wait.

2269
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:25,230
There's like...

2270
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:28,010
There's like sexy Roblox characters.

2271
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:32,050
Why is she so tall?

2272
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:44,230
You know, I'm on my cousin's...

2273
01:49:44,230 --> 01:49:44,470
Wait.

2274
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:45,930
I didn't see how many people.

2275
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:46,810
I...

2276
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:46,950
Oh.

2277
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:48,950
How many...

2278
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:49,990
Oh my god.

2279
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:50,930
I'm getting pushed.

2280
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:51,690
How many people?

2281
01:49:51,950 --> 01:49:53,390
How many people, guys?

2282
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:54,370
I didn't see.

2283
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:57,790
I didn't see how many people were supposed to be in here.

2284
01:49:58,130 --> 01:49:59,250
How many people?

2285
01:49:59,370 --> 01:50:00,310
I didn't see.

2286
01:50:00,810 --> 01:50:01,310
How many?

2287
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:01,910
Two.

2288
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:02,850
Oh.

2289
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:05,750
Oh my god.

2290
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:06,930
We are not working together.

2291
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:08,170
We are absolutely...

2292
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:08,790
Oh, I'm dead.

2293
01:50:08,910 --> 01:50:09,650
I am dead.

2294
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:11,630
Oh, I am so dead.

2295
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:13,830
Let's all die together.

2296
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:19,910
Goodbye, everybody.

2297
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:23,490
Yes.

2298
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:31,130
I have enough.

2299
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:33,150
I'm going back in.

2300
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:36,910
I did it.

2301
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:37,990
Yippee.

2302
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:40,850
What the fuck, Happy Froggy?

2303
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:42,690
I did it, guys.

2304
01:50:43,530 --> 01:50:45,990
But I won't be next to this man.

2305
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:49,110
He seems pretty boring again.

2306
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:00,890
Yeah.

2307
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:02,010
Oh, three players.

2308
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:02,630
Three players.

2309
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:03,150
Three players.

2310
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:04,250
We can work together.

2311
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:05,470
You, me.

2312
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,850
There we go.

2313
01:51:06,930 --> 01:51:07,530
Look at that.

2314
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:08,210
Look at that.

2315
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:10,210
We're so good at working together, guys.

2316
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:11,670
Okay, but like...

2317
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:11,930
Wait, okay.

2318
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:13,870
You can apparently push people out, too.

2319
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:14,690
Oh, I...

2320
01:51:14,690 --> 01:51:15,630
You have to buy that.

2321
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:17,530
Look, I did it.

2322
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:19,990
I see where you're looking.

2323
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:20,730
What do you mean?

2324
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:22,410
I'm just walking around.

2325
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:23,850
I'm just chilling with my homies.

2326
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,030
Yeah, me and...

2327
01:51:26,030 --> 01:51:27,890
Me and Faceless Girl here.

2328
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:28,950
And Kiki.

2329
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:32,010
Okay, how do I talk to people?

2330
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:35,030
Can you...

2331
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:35,190
What?

2332
01:51:35,790 --> 01:51:36,810
Let's team.

2333
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:40,570
Okay, I shouldn't.

2334
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:41,370
There's children.

2335
01:51:41,650 --> 01:51:41,870
I...

2336
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:46,830
I know there's actual children here.

2337
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:52,250
I should not talk to anyone in this lobby.

2338
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:53,750
I should not...

2339
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,870
No, we are not...

2340
01:51:57,270 --> 01:51:59,050
I don't have Kadoosh here.

2341
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:00,630
Hello, Happy Froggy.

2342
01:52:00,990 --> 01:52:02,670
Okay, this guy cannot be a child.

2343
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:08,210
I refuse to believe Happy Froggy is a child.

2344
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:11,570
He is a grown adult like me trying to...

2345
01:52:11,570 --> 01:52:12,350
Oh my god, okay.

2346
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:15,210
1, 2, 3, 4...

2347
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:16,930
Okay, that's not...

2348
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:18,310
Guys, we don't know how to count.

2349
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:21,050
1, 2...

2350
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:21,490
We're counting.

2351
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:23,350
1, 2, 3, 4...

2352
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:24,770
Okay, that's not enough.

2353
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,110
2, 4...

2354
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:27,610
There's not enough.

2355
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:30,110
2, 4, 6, 7...

2356
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:30,210
Wait.

2357
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:30,830
I can't!

2358
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:33,110
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

2359
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:33,270
Oh.

2360
01:52:33,870 --> 01:52:34,250
We're 8.

2361
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:34,690
We're 8.

2362
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:35,550
Oh my god, no!

2363
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:37,470
Don't bully Happy Froggy!

2364
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:38,670
He's just a...

2365
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:39,690
Oh, but get out!

2366
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:42,310
So, we have 8.

2367
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:43,030
We good.

2368
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:45,470
Okay, but what if I just open...

2369
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:45,910
Sorry.

2370
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:48,690
I'm closing it when there was...

2371
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:49,230
Oh no.

2372
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:51,070
Oh no, he is a child.

2373
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:51,710
Oh.

2374
01:52:56,370 --> 01:52:57,570
Oh no.

2375
01:52:58,130 --> 01:52:58,730
Froggy...

2376
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:01,010
Let's stand away from Froggy.

2377
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:03,070
This can't be a child.

2378
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:05,370
These can't be...

2379
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:07,250
These is not a child, I can tell.

2380
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:08,450
Oh dear.

2381
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:10,570
They're cute.

2382
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:13,230
Maybe he's just like me.

2383
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:17,610
I saw what he wrote and I was like, yeah, no.

2384
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:19,790
That's a child.

2385
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:23,830
The face isn't helping.

2386
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:27,150
We're 4, we're 4, we're 4.

2387
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:28,870
Oh, nice.

2388
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:34,750
That's right.

2389
01:53:34,930 --> 01:53:35,310
Look at that.

2390
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:36,630
Wait, what?

2391
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:37,810
We're 4.

2392
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,630
Wait, we need 2 more.

2393
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:44,570
There we go, we're 4 now.

2394
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:46,190
Okay, let's go.

2395
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:47,830
Wait, I like that other guy.

2396
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,630
That guy doesn't seem like a child.

2397
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:51,450
Like, he had the...

2398
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:53,810
You know, the flip-flip from Wicked.

2399
01:53:54,190 --> 01:53:54,750
Oh no.

2400
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:56,290
Wait, no.

2401
01:53:56,890 --> 01:53:59,370
Guys, I feel...

2402
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,930
I feel weird having Thomas the Tank Engine.

2403
01:54:01,930 --> 01:54:03,990
I'm gonna hide in this corner.

2404
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:04,950
I...

2405
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:11,470
Let me...

2406
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,050
I feel weird now.

2407
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:18,930
Now that I'm like, oh man.

2408
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:23,410
There's not a lot of meme avatars in here.

2409
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:27,510
I feel like a little creepier.

2410
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:31,490
I'm gonna hide my Thomas in this corner.

2411
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:33,790
Okay.

2412
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:34,450
Thomas, no.

2413
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:35,290
I'm not gonna...

2414
01:54:35,290 --> 01:54:36,910
I'm not gonna show this.

2415
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:39,370
I think these are actually children.

2416
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:40,910
I think it!

2417
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:45,150
Oh my god.

2418
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:46,690
Okay, 6.

2419
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:47,690
6.

2420
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:48,150
Okay.

2421
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:51,270
Oh.

2422
01:54:52,610 --> 01:54:53,410
Oh.

2423
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:56,790
I guess we die.

2424
01:54:58,190 --> 01:54:58,810
2.

2425
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:01,590
Guys, there's not...

2426
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:02,170
There's not...

2427
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:03,590
There's only 4 of us.

2428
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:05,050
There's only...

2429
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:05,530
Guys.

2430
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,010
This is it.

2431
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:09,430
There's only 4 of us.

2432
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:10,970
Oh no.

2433
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:12,770
Oh no.

2434
01:55:13,650 --> 01:55:14,790
We die.

2435
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:16,250
Goodbye!

2436
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:25,130
He's just...

2437
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:26,430
He's just stretching.

2438
01:55:28,810 --> 01:55:30,370
Oh my god.

2439
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:31,850
Okay.

2440
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,070
I'm gonna leave this lobby.

2441
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:36,710
I'm gonna...

2442
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:39,010
I'm gonna...

2443
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:42,270
I think I have to leave this lobby, guys.

2444
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:43,450
Okay.

2445
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:45,010
Okay, let's...

2446
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:45,630
Let's...

2447
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:47,050
Yeah, this...

2448
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:49,530
I feel a little awkward in this lobby, guys.

2449
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:50,530
He's like...

2450
01:55:57,770 --> 01:55:58,890
Alright, well...

2451
01:55:58,890 --> 01:55:59,650
That was fun.

2452
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:00,930
That...

2453
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:01,370
That...

2454
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:02,150
That...

2455
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,070
That was fun, guys.

2456
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:05,050
Not that key.

2457
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:05,890
Not the Roblox key.

2458
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:07,890
But the Minecraft key was fun, guys.

2459
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:09,410
The Minecraft...

2460
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:11,730
It was nice checking out what the...

2461
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:13,530
The Minecraft...

2462
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:16,730
Let me swap scenes real quick.

2463
01:56:16,730 --> 01:56:19,490
The Minecraft movie event.

2464
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:21,430
I had a fun time checking that out.

2465
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:26,070
My brain has finally kickstarted itself.

2466
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:28,750
So, like, I should be good for the sponsor stream tonight.

2467
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:30,970
By the way, for those who don't know...

2468
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:31,950
Wait!

2469
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:34,250
I can unlock it in Java?

2470
01:56:34,610 --> 01:56:35,570
Okay, I'll do that later.

2471
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:37,850
I still have, like, 3 more days.

2472
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:39,530
Bro, that shit is a grind.

2473
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:42,630
That shit is actually a fucking grind.

2474
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:44,110
There's like...

2475
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:45,810
Like, I have to do all the...

2476
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:46,830
Oh my god.

2477
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:47,810
I'll do that later.

2478
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:49,810
I'm not gonna fucking...

2479
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:52,390
I'm not gonna finish that on stream.

2480
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:54,050
There's too many quests.

2481
01:56:56,150 --> 01:56:57,510
Oh, gosh.

2482
01:56:57,970 --> 01:56:59,270
That was interesting.

2483
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:02,730
Yeah, grinding in Minecraft?

2484
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:03,990
I'd rather just play Rivals.

2485
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:07,330
I'm not gonna be grinding any fucking game.

2486
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:09,810
Yeah, from Minecraft...

2487
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:13,970
From Marvel Rivals grind to Minecraft grind.

2488
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:15,650
Yeah, it's like...

2489
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:17,330
Guys, I need a little rest from that.

2490
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:18,150
Hey, guys.

2491
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:20,570
I had a great time.

2492
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,470
I always have a great time with you guys.

2493
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:25,370
I hope you have a great time watching, everybody.

2494
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:30,070
It was a very, like, random low-energy type stream.

2495
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:31,550
But...

2496
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,670
Right now, I'm not okay at the moment.

2497
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:36,850
I'm honestly...

2498
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:40,170
I'm honestly not okay right now.

2499
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:46,540
I am...

2500
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:49,880
The blood moon is going strong right now.

2501
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,300
But...

2502
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,680
But I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

2503
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:56,220
I do have another stream later tonight.

2504
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:58,460
I'll be watching a...

2505
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:01,800
The Call of Duty draft day.

2506
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,540
I don't know what the drafting is at the moment.

2507
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,260
I don't really know what the draft day is.

2508
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:08,640
I assume they're, like...

2509
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:13,640
I assume it's just picking teammates and, like, seeing, like, which...

2510
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:17,160
Categorizing teammates into teams or something?

2511
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:17,780
I don't know.

2512
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,000
I'll read the briefing later.

2513
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:22,600
I'll read the sponsor briefing later.

2514
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,740
But please support the Twitch stream later tonight.

2515
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,820
It really helps a lot.

2516
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:30,860
They picked me and a couple of other really big streamers for it.

2517
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:38,020
So, I would really appreciate if you guys can hop down for the stream and just hang out with me while we watch the draft day.

2518
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:38,840
Hey, guys.

2519
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,960
I hope you had a great time watching.

2520
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:45,260
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2521
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:49,980
And if you didn't stay up for me, head to bed or come to the sponsor stream tonight on Twitch.

2522
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:55,480
It's not food time.

2523
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:56,880
It's Walkie's time, by the way.

2524
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:58,240
It's actually not food time.

2525
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,160
It's just Walkie times.

2526
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:00,800
Anyway, I'll see you guys later, everybody.

2527
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:01,720
Bye, guys.

2528
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:02,500
Bye!

2529
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,780
He always knows when I'm ending.

2530
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:06,780
I don't know how.
