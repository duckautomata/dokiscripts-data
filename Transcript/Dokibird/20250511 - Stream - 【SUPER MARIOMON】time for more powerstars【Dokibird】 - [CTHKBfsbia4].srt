1
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,930
Oh, oh, whoops, I forgot the most important part.

2
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,730
Give me a sec.

3
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,370
I forgot to do something very important.

4
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,250
Whoops, I knew I forgot something.

5
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,710
Alright, give me a sec, guys.

6
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,890
Give me a sec.

7
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,510
It's me.

8
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,650
I was like, did I forgot something?

9
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,750
Oh, wait.

10
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,810
Wait a minute.

11
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,030
Oh, wait, why is it not working?

12
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:28,930
Okay.

13
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,210
Wait, is it because...

14
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,050
Oh, I'm on.

15
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,750
Oh, okay.

16
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,410
I've been on date an entire time.

17
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,290
Oh, whoops, on my phone.

18
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,130
Whoops, okay.

19
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,270
Alright, sorry.

20
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,410
My brain's not working today.

21
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,130
Okay, so...

22
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,290
Alright.

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,290
I have to let you guys know that...

24
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,590
It might have been a big mistake to schedule a...

25
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,030
A stream...

26
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,390
A game...

27
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,170
That's all about talking...

28
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,190
Right after two...

29
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,070
Back to back...

30
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,770
Long hour streams.

31
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,330
And...

32
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,030
Especially one where I was streaming for 17 plus hours.

33
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,350
So...

34
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,030
We're not gonna do a toad voice today.

35
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,910
Because my throat...

36
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,850
Today...

37
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,790
I should be resting my throat.

38
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,110
So...

39
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,370
But...

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,550
Here we are.

41
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,650
But...

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,330
Um...

43
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,630
There's no toad...

44
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,010
There's no toad voices.

45
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,750
Um...

46
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,950
So it's just gonna be regular voice jokey.

47
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,690
Also...

48
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,080
If you guys didn't know...

49
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,460
Um...

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
Spicy foods...

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,860
Are not good for your throat.

52
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,160
When you're like...

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
Trying to like...

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,960
You know...

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
Relax your throat.

56
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,300
And then...

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,640
Uh...

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,600
And you guys wanna know what I ate today?

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,440
Or...

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,820
Yeah...

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,460
Today...

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,700
I was like...

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,340
You know what?

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
I'm craving some spicy noodles today.

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,300
But it tasted great though.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,960
My stomach's happy.

67
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,640
My throat is not...

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,020
Yes, I ate the bulldog noodles today.

69
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,020
Um...

70
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,380
It was not just like bulldog noodles.

71
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:27,920
It was like...

72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,500
Those like...

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,400
Korean sandwiches.

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,860
Like the giant omelette sandwiches on...

75
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,740
Um...

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,380
Like the famous Korean street food.

77
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,860
But they added like...

78
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,360
Bulldog noodles on top of it.

79
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,480
And I was like...

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,180
Ooh...

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,120
Mmm...

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,100
That sounds delicious.

83
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
And it was.

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,460
But my throat is not happy right now.

85
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,500
So...

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,400
It might not be a super long stream today.

87
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,900
Um...

88
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,260
But...

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,000
But...

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,780
We're still here.

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,380
So...

92
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,460
I might be more...

93
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,500
Relaxed and comfy.

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,500
And like...

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,220
I'm not gonna do voices today, unfortunately.

96
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,200
So there's no todoki today.

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,080
Um...

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,540
Anyway!

99
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,380
Alright!

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,240
Um...

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,220
What was I gonna say?

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,800
Oh yeah!

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,620
So for those who don't know...

104
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,080
Uh...

105
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,700
Yesterday...

106
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,920
I might have streamed...

107
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,860
17 hours of Marvel Rivals.

108
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,140
Um...

109
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,820
I know...

110
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,780
Realized that...

111
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,200
It might have been a bad idea...

112
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,780
To...

113
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,640
You know...

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,420
Make the tournament VOD...

115
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,020
11 plus hours on YouTube.

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
Because I realized...

117
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,160
You know...

118
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,040
This was sort of a big deal with the people I was playing with.

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
Especially like...

120
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,020
One of them was Tyler1.

121
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,460
And I feel like...

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,660
A lot of people are now...

123
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,880
Not gonna watch the VOD...

124
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
Because they're gonna see it's...

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,820
11 plus hours.

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,080
So...

127
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,200
People might...

128
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,040
Miss out...

129
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,040
On the interactions...

130
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,820
With like...

131
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,340
Like...

132
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,840
As the team.

133
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,300
Because...

134
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,780
I mean...

135
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,280
If you see the VOD...

136
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,080
And you see like...

137
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,260
11 plus hours...

138
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,400
People might not want to click that VOD...

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,240
To watch it back.

140
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,260
I realized...

141
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,180
Oh wait...

142
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,700
I sort of fucked up a little bit.

143
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,460
My addiction sort of...

144
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,080
My...

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,260
Marvel Rivals addiction...

146
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,780
Sort of like...

147
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,100
You know...

148
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,640
Fucked me a little bit over...

149
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,900
About thinking what could be good for my channel.

150
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,880
I...

151
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,040
I...

152
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,800
So...

153
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,860
So I was like...

154
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,380
Oh man...

155
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,940
Maybe I should...

156
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,080
I...

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,660
I should have definitely moved the rink grinding...

158
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,060
Over to Twitch...

159
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,000
So that I could kept the VOD short...

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,840
Instead of...

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,400
You know...

162
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,900
11 plus hours...

163
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,720
I could have...

164
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,780
Made it...

165
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,460
Um...

166
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,240
Um...

167
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,440
I could have made it...

168
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,180
A lot shorter...

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,460
Um...

170
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,200
Yeah...

171
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:46,980
So...

172
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,800
Uh...

173
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,240
So I was like...

174
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,000
Oops...

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Uh...

176
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,460
Well I guess a lot of people are gonna miss out on the fact that I played with him.

177
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:53,800
Um...

178
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,020
I...

179
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,160
Whoopsie...

180
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,460
Um...

181
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,900
Uh...

182
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,800
But yeah...

183
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,380
Anyway...

184
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,080
What was I gonna say?

185
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,420
Oh yeah...

186
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,120
Um...

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,660
Uh...

188
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,460
My friends told me this today...

189
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,420
And it made me a...

190
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,280
A little bit...

191
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,160
Feel a little bit...

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,880
I feel like...

193
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,720
Better...

194
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay...

195
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,740
So...

196
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,820
I didn't even realize this...

197
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,800
But...

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,540
Um...

199
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,200
During the last match...

200
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,060
Against XQC's team...

201
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,840
Um...

202
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,740
I didn't even...

203
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
I was thinking about that...

204
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,740
But like...

205
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,720
Uh...

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm not gonna make an edited video...

207
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,220
Because it was...

208
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,620
It's not that long...

209
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,500
By the way...

210
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,420
In that tournament...

211
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,300
And I feel like there's...

212
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,180
I don't know...

213
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,700
Um...

214
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,340
I don't know...

215
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,300
I'll think about it...

216
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,880
But like...

217
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,060
Like...

218
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,400
I didn't realize that...

219
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,440
Um...

220
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,220
XQC's team...

221
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,140
Basically...

222
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,580
Like...

223
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,740
I wouldn't say Target banned me...

224
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,700
But like...

225
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,960
They banned...

226
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,200
Loki and Adam...

227
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,780
Which would've been the two healers...

228
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,020
I would've played...

229
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
If like...

230
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,060
They didn't do it...

231
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,200
And...

232
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,620
Like...

233
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,140
I just...

234
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,620
I really...

235
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,120
I didn't realize that...

236
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,720
Um...

237
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,700
And obviously we banned Luna...

238
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:57,980
So like...

239
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,640
I couldn't do anything about that too...

240
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,100
Uh...

241
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,060
And then...

242
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,560
Cause my friends were telling me...

243
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,060
That...

244
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,900
Um...

245
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,780
Because they...

246
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,160
The reason why...

247
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,360
Our team...

248
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,240
Was doing really well...

249
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,180
Was because...

250
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,160
I was technically the second DPS...

251
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,440
For our team...

252
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,240
By playing Loki and...

253
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Adam...

254
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,780
Because I wasn't really thinking about it...

255
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,400
Cause like...

256
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
When I was on Adam...

257
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,180
I was like...

258
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,940
Making a lot of impact as Adam...

259
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,540
Being like...

260
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,900
Literally the second DPS...

261
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,360
And doing...

262
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
A lot of like...

263
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,860
Um...

264
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,100
Doing a lot of like...

265
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,860
Like kills and damage through it...

266
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,060
And then like...

267
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,820
On Loki...

268
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,860
I have three clones...

269
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,540
And...

270
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,200
I was also like...

271
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,680
Doing...

272
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,420
Like you know...

273
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,640
Keeping everybody alive...

274
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,660
With my lamps...

275
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,040
And like the three clones I had...

276
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,580
And I didn't...

277
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,360
I wasn't thinking about it...

278
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,640
I was like...

279
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:50,980
Oh wait...

280
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,140
You're right...

281
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,340
Cause then I was like...

282
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,840
I was like...

283
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,360
Yeah...

284
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,580
I have to play on Sue...

285
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,140
Because like...

286
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,000
We're already really limited...

287
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,240
Like...

288
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,000
We're already like...

289
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,140
Super limited...

290
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,160
On the supports we were...

291
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,020
We had...

292
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,160
Since there were three of us...

293
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,000
And like...

294
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,100
Sue is a good pick...

295
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,620
But like...

296
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,360
She doesn't have any...

297
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,860
Fragging potential...

298
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,660
And like...

299
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,880
All I could do was just...

300
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,560
Keep my...

301
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,480
Keep my players alive...

302
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,440
At that point...

303
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,800
Like...

304
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah...

305
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,540
I can shield and everything...

306
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,500
But there was no...

307
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I couldn't help...

308
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,200
With output...

309
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,580
With damage anymore...

310
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,200
I really...

311
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,800
And I was like...

312
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,240
Wait...

313
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,860
And I was thinking back...

314
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,220
I was thinking back...

315
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,420
Like...

316
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh yeah...

317
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,280
Like...

318
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,020
I got some really...

319
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,040
Clutch kills...

320
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
And like...

321
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,820
I helped with the damage department...

322
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
For my team...

323
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,080
When I was on Loki...

324
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,780
And Adam...

325
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
And because...

326
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,320
Like...

327
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,980
They banned...

328
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,560
The DPS supports...

329
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:41,700
Like...

330
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,620
I was...

331
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,220
Stuck in...

332
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,580
Just supporting...

333
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,040
I couldn't do damage...

334
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,700
For my team anymore...

335
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
And like...

336
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
It made me realize...

337
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,420
Like...

338
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,920
It made me feel a lot better...

339
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,140
I...

340
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,460
I definitely felt a lot better...

341
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,500
Knowing that...

342
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,280
Cause I was like...

343
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,560
Oh...

344
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,220
I had impact!

345
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,000
I was like...

346
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,020
I was like...

347
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,740
On my team!

348
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,580
Yay!

349
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,880
We lost...

350
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,020
But I still...

351
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,660
I...

352
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,360
I did something!

353
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,020
I had...

354
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,320
I had...

355
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,380
Value!

356
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,720
Yippee!

357
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,260
But...

358
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,780
Like...

359
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,240
I was like...

360
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,560
Wait...

361
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,580
You're right...

362
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,520
They like...

363
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,300
Sorta target banned me...

364
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,340
And it worked!

365
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,400
I mean...

366
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
They also target banned Tyler1...

367
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,000
But...

368
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
And I also...

369
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,560
Fucked us over...

370
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,000
And...

371
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,480
But they also...

372
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,260
Got rid of...

373
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,440
The second DPS...

374
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,660
The second hidden DPS!

375
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
The second hidden DPS!

376
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,300
And like...

377
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,640
And it just made me really happy...

378
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,880
Um...

379
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,910
It just made me...

380
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,220
Um...

381
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,120
Um...

382
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,640
Really happy...

383
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,500
Um...

384
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,300
Just cause of the fact that...

385
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,980
You know...

386
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,440
You know...

387
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,220
I like...

388
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,680
Um...

389
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,620
Did something...

390
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,060
To like...

391
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,100
To like...

392
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,960
Be focused...

393
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,200
You know?

394
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,300
I was like...

395
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,640
Yippee!

396
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,040
Um...

397
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,860
Uh...

398
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,260
What else did I want to talk about?

399
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,420
Uh...

400
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,880
I wrote...

401
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,060
You know...

402
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,920
I always write down stuff...

403
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,620
I want to talk about...

404
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,840
Um...

405
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,200
Oh yeah...

406
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,900
Um...

407
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,960
So...

408
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,280
The reason why...

409
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,700
Uh...

410
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,200
Uh...

411
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Chakori...

412
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Thank you for the super chat...

413
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,700
Thank you...

414
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,120
Thank you...

415
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,580
Target ban also means...

416
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,860
Can't proper ban...

417
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,260
Yippee!

418
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,200
Wait...

419
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
What do you mean by that?

420
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,200
I don't really understand that sentence...

421
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,080
Uh...

422
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,760
Um...

423
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,320
I mean like...

424
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
I can put on my support...

425
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,420
Fine...

426
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,520
But we got rid of all the supports...

427
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,440
That...

428
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,120
Can do damage...

429
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,560
Except for Jeff...

430
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,540
But like...

431
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,080
Um...

432
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,040
Can do damage...

433
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,540
And heal at the same time...

434
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,560
I mean we have Jeff...

435
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,100
But then I...

436
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,160
It requires me to be the flanked Jeff...

437
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,920
And...

438
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm sorry...

439
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:12,820
I...

440
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,200
I don't trust...

441
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,860
My team...

442
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,940
To like...

443
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,220
I don't trust my team...

444
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,920
To...

445
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,620
Heal...

446
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,960
Without me...

447
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
Um...

448
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,060
Which is a little harsh to say...

449
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,840
But like...

450
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,140
But like...

451
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,040
Yeah...

452
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,620
That's...

453
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,980
That's...

454
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,500
It's...

455
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,760
It's what it is...

456
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Um...

457
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,840
What was I...

458
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,380
Oh...

459
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,820
Oh wait...

460
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,540
Sorry...

461
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,900
My mind is all over the place...

462
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,840
Because...

463
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,300
Um...

464
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,920
Uh...

465
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,720
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

466
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,720
Uh...

467
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,060
...my mind is all over the place...

468
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,620
Because...

469
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,700
Uh...

470
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,500
Oh my god, wait, I actually lost my track of that.

471
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,420
Wait, okay, what was I... What was my last sentence before my cogs, like, jammed?

472
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,420
What was I talking about?

473
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,380
Before it, like, jammed, I'm trying to kickstart it.

474
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,780
No, the last sentence that I was trying to say.

475
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,940
No, no, no, and I was, like, going through a sentence.

476
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,020
Was I actually still talking about Marvel Rivals?

477
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,620
I swear I was trying to move on to another topic.

478
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:06,990
Oh!

479
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,130
Doki Amber Doge update.

480
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,490
Okay.

481
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,110
Doki Amber Doge update.

482
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,990
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

483
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,370
Thank you.

484
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:15,950
Thank you.

485
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,590
Got it.

486
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,190
So 16 hours of Marvel Rivals is good, but 17 hours is too much.

487
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,530
Thank you for the super chat.

488
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:22,870
Thank you.

489
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,390
Thank you.

490
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,390
Okay, so I was... the reason why, um, I started a little bit late is because...

491
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,890
Oh yeah, before I say that, also remember this thought for me after that.

492
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,650
I was a Doki Amber Doge.

493
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,150
Sorry, I'm, like, jumping all over the place.

494
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:41,350
When I'm not so brain rotted and my mind is not, like, turning slowly, I can focus on one topic.

495
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,310
I don't have ADHD.

496
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,450
I know people keep thinking I have ADHD, but I don't.

497
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,990
But, like, I want to talk about this other topic before I go into the Doki Amber Doge topic because it's related to the last topic I talk about.

498
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,190
I know that sounds all confusing, but you think about it, it will make sense.

499
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,790
Um, anyway...

500
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,510
Anyway, I want to say, um, I basically...

501
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:12,170
The day... the day after the 17-hour Marvel Rivals grind, I literally was just in my bed the whole day.

502
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,930
Like, I woke up, and I just laid there watching YouTube shorts.

503
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,270
I did not do anything else.

504
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,770
Now, that's why the waiting room was so lit.

505
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,170
I had to push up an hour because I'm, uh...

506
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:35,550
Uh, because I was just laying in a bed just, like, disassociated because 17 hours was maybe a little too much.

507
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:48,350
I think if I didn't have a six-hour Dynasty War of streams the day before, I think it would have been fine.

508
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,510
Yeah, it's, like, post-gaming clarity.

509
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,290
No, it's 100% that.

510
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,590
You know, like, how you start regretting?

511
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,430
You know the word?

512
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,770
Post-not-clarity?

513
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,430
Post-rivals clarity.

514
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,270
I was like, maybe that...

515
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,230
Oh, it was a mistake.

516
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,890
Like, that's wild.

517
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,710
Post-post-rivals clarity.

518
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,510
Um, anyway.

519
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:25,490
Uh, and, like, and, like, I actually got it all out of my system, and I'm like, yeah, I don't really want to play rivals for a while.

520
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,230
Like, really?

521
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,390
I was like, well, that's...

522
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,210
I think I played enough rivals for the next at least two to three days.

523
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,270
I...

524
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,450
You know, okay.

525
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,590
You know that famous image of, like...

526
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,450
Okay, I know it's, like, a meme from another meme.

527
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:52,810
But, like, there was one where, like, Mr. Fantastic or, like, Mrs. Fantastic, depending on, like, which one you want to be, is all, like, shriveled up in bed.

528
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,330
And then, like, Mr. or Mrs. Fantastic is, like, eh, day after tomorrow.

529
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,330
That's... I'm the shriveled up person.

530
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,510
And then the other one is, like, Marvel Rivalist.

531
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,130
That...

532
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,390
Like, that meme?

533
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,330
Wait, wait.

534
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,150
Let me find it.

535
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,650
Let me...

536
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,430
It's safe for work, by the way.

537
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,910
Mr. Fantastic...

538
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,850
Ms. Fantastic...

539
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,150
Bed...

540
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,930
Meme...

541
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,910
For those who want to know...

542
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,790
Wait, what is...

543
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,450
Oh, my God.

544
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:23,750
Okay.

545
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,430
Uh...

546
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,430
Wait, is there, like, an actual picture of this?

547
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,430
Okay, give me a sec.

548
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,090
No!

549
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,150
There has to be a picture of this!

550
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,290
An artwork!

551
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,650
Oh, my God.

552
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,490
What is the right Google...

553
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,290
Google prompt for this?

554
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,030
Okay.

555
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,190
Twitter.

556
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,590
Twitter.

557
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,970
Ms. Fantastic.

558
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,550
Meme.

559
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:50,650
All right.

560
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,230
Wait.

561
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,270
Ms. Fantastic.

562
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,130
Bed.

563
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,050
Oh, my God.

564
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,770
Meme.

565
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,110
Oh, my God.

566
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,810
Why didn't I save it?

567
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,330
I just...

568
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,790
I just wanna know!

569
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,610
I need to see the...

570
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,010
The picture!

571
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:11,630
Okay.

572
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,210
Mr. Fantastic...

573
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,730
Shriveled...

574
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,930
Up...

575
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,630
In...

576
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,010
Bed.

577
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,030
Do I have...

578
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,250
Do I have to...

579
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,490
Okay.

580
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,070
I've got the Ms. Fantastic version.

581
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,910
I don't have the Mr. Fantastic version.

582
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,370
I don't know where that one is.

583
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,310
I...

584
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,930
All right.

585
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,110
So, I don't know where the Ms. Fantastic version is.

586
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:35,950
But...

587
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,750
Oh, Mr. Fantastic.

588
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:37,290
Okay.

589
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,170
So, this is...

590
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,910
All right.

591
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,470
So, that's...

592
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,310
I'm Ms. Fantastic.

593
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,690
And then that's Marvel Rivals.

594
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,870
That's...

595
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:47,870
Wait.

596
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,910
I have a better one.

597
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,190
We have a better version.

598
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,710
Marvel R...

599
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,850
Wait.

600
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,150
Wait.

601
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,390
Wait.

602
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:53,550
Wait.

603
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,510
Let me Photoshop this real quick.

604
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,470
Let me...

605
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,710
Wait.

606
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,350
Wait.

607
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,630
Let me...

608
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,730
Let me...

609
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,030
Guys.

610
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,310
No, this is very important.

611
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,710
I have to Photoshop this.

612
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,630
So, you can understand...

613
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,410
The full context.

614
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,610
Let me...

615
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,510
I'm cookie right now.

616
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,130
Let me Photoshop this real fast.

617
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,010
All right.

618
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,630
Okay.

619
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,210
Let me see.

620
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,730
And then...

621
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,590
All right.

622
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,570
Don't worry.

623
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,110
It'll be so worth it, guys.

624
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,980
It's so stupid.

625
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,600
Okay.

626
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,160
Give me...

627
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,360
Guys.

628
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:36,600
No.

629
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
I swear to God.

630
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,540
I swear to God.

631
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
It'd be...

632
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,300
It'd be so worth it.

633
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,560
When you...

634
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,860
When I...

635
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,360
When I fix this picture.

636
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,620
I swear to God.

637
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,520
All right.

638
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,400
This is...

639
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,120
This is me.

640
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,010
That's me on the right.

641
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,950
For the whole day.

642
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,730
I was like...

643
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,650
That's the whole...

644
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,650
The whole day.

645
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,890
I was just like...

646
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,330
Oh, man.

647
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,690
I need to make my waiting room.

648
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,570
I...

649
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,190
I need to...

650
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,910
I need to make my waiting room.

651
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,030
I...

652
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,630
Oh, yeah.

653
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,690
God looks even worse.

654
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,110
Oh, yeah.

655
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:35,390
Wait.

656
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:35,790
You're right.

657
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,690
Let me make it better.

658
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,950
No.

659
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,670
You're so right.

660
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,090
I knew I'm missing something.

661
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,130
Um...

662
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,530
Wait.

663
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:41,870
Guys.

664
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,430
You're right.

665
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:43,330
Guys.

666
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:43,690
Sorry.

667
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,990
I forgot one important addition to...

668
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,630
To this beautiful...

669
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:48,890
Picture.

670
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,350
Okay.

671
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,190
Okay.

672
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,850
Give me a sec.

673
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:54,770
Okay.

674
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,110
Um...

675
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,030
Wait.

676
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,890
Give me a sec, guys.

677
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,190
All right.

678
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,750
Watch this.

679
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,370
Watch this update in real time.

680
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,350
I forgot one...

681
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,790
One more thing.

682
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,070
Let me be perfect.

683
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,970
Let me...

684
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,870
All right.

685
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,350
Give me a sec.

686
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,970
We're updating this in real time.

687
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,730
All right.

688
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:30,950
There you go.

689
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,310
Now...

690
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,490
Okay.

691
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,990
So, like...

692
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,030
That's basically how I felt today.

693
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,550
When I...

694
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,470
When I...

695
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,190
I woke up.

696
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,850
I was just like...

697
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,910
I was like...

698
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,410
Oh, my God.

699
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,170
I should not have played 17 hours of my marrivals yesterday.

700
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,210
I'm...

701
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,730
I was not ready for it.

702
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,350
I was...

703
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,150
I thought...

704
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,510
I thought I was...

705
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,990
I thought I was really okay.

706
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,230
But I was...

707
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,130
I was not okay.

708
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,050
I was not...

709
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,490
I was...

710
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,810
I was not okay at all.

711
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,510
Let's move yourself over half the...

712
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,990
I was...

713
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,350
Yeah, so...

714
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,450
That...

715
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,610
That's basically...

716
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,850
How I felt...

717
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,970
When I woke up.

718
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,290
And why the waiting room...

719
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,930
Took so long.

720
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,490
Oh, by the way...

721
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,730
Okay, who's the artist for this?

722
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,050
I...

723
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,230
I just don't even know the...

724
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,470
Okay.

725
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,890
I also credit the artist too.

726
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:44,830
Because...

727
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,510
This is the artist, by the way.

728
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,710
Thank you for making such a beautiful picture.

729
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,830
Here you go.

730
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,090
By the way, this is...

731
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,890
I edited it though.

732
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,210
I am the artist of the original picture.

733
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,270
But...

734
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,430
Don't forget the goodnight, Dragoon stream in the chair.

735
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,550
In the chair.

736
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,030
Lali for the super chat.

737
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,430
Thank you.

738
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,190
Thank you.

739
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,250
But yeah.

740
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,170
So...

741
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,310
That's basically me in bed.

742
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,770
And I was like...

743
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,250
Oh my god.

744
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,010
Why did I do that?

745
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,930
Why did I...

746
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,510
Why did I...

747
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,590
Why did I...

748
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,630
I felt...

749
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,770
I felt invincible yesterday.

750
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,090
I could have...

751
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,370
I felt like I could have gone on even longer.

752
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,650
I like...

753
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,110
I could have...

754
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,950
I thought...

755
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,990
Yesterday I was like...

756
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,230
I could have streamed...

757
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,110
For two...

758
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,850
At least two to three more hours.

759
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,290
If those...

760
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,450
E-daters didn't...

761
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,870
Fucking ruin it for me.

762
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,570
Who would have thought...

763
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,470
It was a bad idea.

764
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,630
Oh my god.

765
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,770
But that's why I'm like...

766
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,090
More...

767
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,790
Out...

768
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,330
Right...

769
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,030
Um...

770
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,290
A little bit more out of it.

771
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,270
And my mind...

772
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,850
Mind's cogs...

773
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,490
Are turning...

774
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,150
Really, really slow.

775
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:14,530
Okay.

776
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,630
So those who don't know...

777
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,810
Who missed out on...

778
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,710
Yesterday's...

779
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,810
Twitch adventures...

780
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,290
Um...

781
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,410
Right after I finished streaming on YouTube...

782
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,030
I went straight to Twitch...

783
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,850
Um...

784
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,690
To like finish the job...

785
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,230
Um...

786
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,150
Because I was like...

787
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,830
That's it.

788
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,950
I'm not done yet.

789
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,950
Let's continue this on Twitch.

790
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,230
You think the 12 hour...

791
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,130
VOD limit is gonna stop me?

792
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,390
I'm gonna...

793
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,210
I'm...

794
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,790
I'm ready for round two...

795
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,910
Of Marvel Rivals.

796
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,510
And...

797
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,050
The only reason...

798
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,790
I ended the stream...

799
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,770
Was because...

800
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,770
The last game I had...

801
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,250
I bumped into an...

802
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,910
To an e-couple...

803
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,190
To the e-date...

804
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,830
Um...

805
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,130
I bumped into a...

806
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,130
E-couple slash e-daters...

807
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,810
Um...

808
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,890
On my team...

809
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,570
And all they were doing...

810
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,650
Was just yelling at each other...

811
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,370
And like bringing up...

812
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,090
Their like...

813
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,870
Fight...

814
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,230
To end a public rank match...

815
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,050
It was...

816
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,550
It was fucking wild.

817
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,050
It was so cringe.

818
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:17,990
I...

819
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,670
Like they were yelling...

820
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,030
It was so...

821
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,930
It was like a toxic fight too.

822
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:29,850
Cause they're like...

823
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,630
She was like...

824
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,410
I don't even know why I'm playing with you right now.

825
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,570
You were spamming me.

826
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,250
I couldn't even brush my teeth in the morning.

827
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,950
And you were spamming me to play with you.

828
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,810
Oh my god.

829
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,670
I don't even know why I have to play with...

830
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,350
I'm playing with you.

831
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,290
And I was like...

832
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,290
What the fuck?

833
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:52,610
I was like... I was just like, what the fuck is going on here?

834
00:25:52,790 --> 00:26:00,470
And they were just yelling at each other for the entire time of the second half.

835
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,170
And she, yeah, she even said, no one likes you.

836
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,570
And I was like, whoa.

837
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,370
And then the guy was like, I'm not boasting you anymore after this game.

838
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,450
And I was like, what?

839
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,310
Like, he was like, I don't even want to play with you.

840
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:21,850
You know what?

841
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,290
I'll do it with someone else.

842
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,770
Yes, in open comms.

843
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,770
They were fun.

844
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,470
I was like, do you not have a Discord together?

845
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:39,210
Like, why are you not talking about it in your disc?

846
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,930
Why are you bringing us along with it?

847
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,590
Do you, like, get off on, like, a public audience?

848
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:46,570
What?

849
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,150
Like...

850
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,470
I was thinking...

851
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,730
Like, do you not... Is this, like, a thing for you?

852
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,610
Is this a kink?

853
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,710
Like, is this a kink?

854
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,130
Like, are you... Do you just want to, like, bring this to the public, like, audience?

855
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,770
And then, like, and then, like, it makes you so heated?

856
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,290
And you're like, oh, this is so hot.

857
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,970
Arguing in a public space.

858
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,030
Like, it makes it feel more real for them.

859
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,430
It's part of the play.

860
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,670
Oh, my God.

861
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,990
Public...

862
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:31,590
The more people watching, the better it is for them by bringing it in.

863
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,170
It makes the relationship feel more real.

864
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,590
I was a very unwilling participant.

865
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,890
And that is why...

866
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,670
That was why we stopped there.

867
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,530
Because I was like...

868
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:51,290
I was like, guys, I don't think I'm into...

869
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,870
I don't...

870
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,230
Guys, I don't think I want to play anymore.

871
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,510
Because if these are the queues I'm gonna...

872
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:02,890
If I've queued so late that I've bumped into an e-couple arguing...

873
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,290
Right?

874
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,130
Arguing in my game.

875
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,970
And then, like, making me feel a little bit uncomfortable.

876
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,110
Because I feel like this might be part of their play.

877
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,010
Hey, I think it's time to get off the internet.

878
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,830
I feel like I need...

879
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,970
I think it's time to stop.

880
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,370
Yeah, and they were also throwing.

881
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,210
They were throwing, but somehow...

882
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,250
The enemy team started throwing too.

883
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,510
It was crazy.

884
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,270
And I was like...

885
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,350
Also, I realized people were starting to throw.

886
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,430
And I was like, yeah, I don't think it's a clam day.

887
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,370
I don't think we're gonna be clamming anymore.

888
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,270
I don't...

889
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,110
But yeah, that's what happened.

890
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,110
That's basically what happened.

891
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,510
Anyway, dad update.

892
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,490
Dad update.

893
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,630
So, dad's gonna come home tomorrow night.

894
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,710
Um, because, um, the dog sitter can't take care of him, uh, this week.

895
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,010
So, he's gonna be coming home tomorrow night.

896
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:18,390
Um, that means, um, I'm not sure how the schedule's gonna be going for tomorrow...

897
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,350
Like, starting next week.

898
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,310
Um, cause I don't know how...

899
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,230
How much I have to supervise him.

900
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,490
They did say he was recovering a lot.

901
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,090
And I'm just...

902
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,470
And I did order more ramps for him.

903
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,710
Just in case...

904
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,330
I don't want him to...

905
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,610
You know, of course, I don't want him to jump.

906
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,950
Because, like, he just got back from a very expensive surgery.

907
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,490
Um, so, um...

908
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,330
Um, he's gonna be coming home tomorrow night.

909
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,170
Um, this may or may not affect the schedules and stuff.

910
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,970
Um, we'll see how it goes.

911
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,270
Um, that might also mean I might not...

912
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,170
I don't know if I'll be...

913
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,310
It depends if he's sleeping.

914
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,990
If I put him in a locked kennel...

915
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,030
Um, not kennel, sorry.

916
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,330
If I put him in his own...

917
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,610
Maybe I'll try and get a box.

918
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,670
Just, like, how they did.

919
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,370
And then just put him in the box when I...

920
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,870
And put him next to me in the box.

921
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,670
When I do, like, longer streams.

922
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,850
But I'll figure that out tomorrow.

923
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,550
Cause I don't know, like, what...

924
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,510
This scenario's gonna be like.

925
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,630
Um, when he's actually home.

926
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,330
Um, but I do need to supervise him and everything.

927
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,770
So he'll most likely be, like, next to me and stuff.

928
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,770
In his own little doggy box.

929
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,750
Or whatever I use to keep him confined in an area.

930
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,750
And everything.

931
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,470
So, we'll see how...

932
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,390
But, like, the only thing I'm worried about...

933
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,110
Like I said...

934
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,870
My office is, like, a little sauna.

935
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,890
So, like, that's the thing I'm most worried about.

936
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,530
Because my office is, like, a little sauna.

937
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,290
And I don't know if he's, like, gonna be comfortable in my office.

938
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,850
Um, because right now...

939
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,750
I'm having a little bit of trouble breathing.

940
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,090
Because I need to turn up the aircon a little bit.

941
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,970
Give me a sec, actually.

942
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,810
I'm having a little trouble breathing right now.

943
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,310
Because it's so hot in my office.

944
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,590
I'll be right back, guys.

945
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,770
Speaking of that.

946
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,020
Okay, I turn up the...

947
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,280
I turn up the little...

948
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,600
I turn up the aircon right now.

949
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,640
So, it should get a little better when it's a little cooler.

950
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,480
So, I'll see how it goes.

951
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:20,780
Um...

952
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,480
Because I don't know how much he wants to move.

953
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,740
Because the dogster was telling me that he likes to move a lot.

954
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,640
Like, he's starting to...

955
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,420
Wanting to...

956
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,140
Uh...

957
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,100
Move a lot now.

958
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,620
And I'm, like, a little worried that he might try moving a lot when I'm not watching him.

959
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,700
So, we'll see.

960
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,620
I just need to talk to...

961
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,700
That's what I was, like, talking to the dog sitter about.

962
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,160
So, that's a little dad update.

963
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,560
Um...

964
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,420
They did say...

965
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,620
They could take care...

966
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,880
They're gonna see if they could take care of him later on.

967
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,040
Um...

968
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,580
Because, like I said, I feel like...

969
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:58,140
Them taking care of dad during his, you know, recovery period is a better decision than me taking care of him.

970
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,660
Because I'm only one person.

971
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,720
Um...

972
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,260
But...

973
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,640
The dog sitter is, like, an entire family with children, with teenagers.

974
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,460
Um...

975
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,160
Who have been looking after them for the last two weeks.

976
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,780
And, um...

977
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,440
You know, yeah, there's a lot of people looking after him and stuff.

978
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,960
So, they were able to monitor him much better than me.

979
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,420
And, like, giving him the best care possible.

980
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,560
So, if it's possible...

981
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,740
Like, I'm gonna see if it's possible to have him go back to the dog sitter later on.

982
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,860
Um...

983
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,880
To continue the, like, you know, continue the treatment and stuff like that.

984
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,800
And the physical therapy exercises.

985
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,660
Because I just feel like, uh...

986
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,820
They were doing really well with the care in general.

987
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,580
And I'm worried about taking care of him by myself.

988
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,020
Because, you know, I feel like I lack the experience a lot.

989
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,900
So, we'll see.

990
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,340
We'll see.

991
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,940
But that's the dad update.

992
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,340
Um...

993
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,660
Hmm...

994
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,860
I don't think there's anything else.

995
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,780
Anyway, let's actually...

996
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,940
Let's actually play the game.

997
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:56,820
Um...

998
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,160
It won't be a long stream today.

999
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,140
Unfortunately.

1000
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,780
But, uh...

1001
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,720
Maybe, like...

1002
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,480
One to two hours.

1003
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,540
Um...

1004
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:05,960
Uh...

1005
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,280
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.

1006
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,620
So...

1007
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,500
Oh, not one to two hours.

1008
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,380
Uh, two hours maximum today.

1009
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,760
Just because I do have another stream tonight with Goodnight Dragoons.

1010
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,300
And, um...

1011
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,500
Oh, yeah.

1012
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,100
By the way, for those who didn't know, I rescheduled Goodnight Dragoons today!

1013
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,000
Because, you know, I was...

1014
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,040
I...

1015
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,720
I had a no problem.

1016
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1017
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1018
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,740
Ha, ha, ha.

1019
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,600
Ha, ha, ha.

1020
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,700
Uh...

1021
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,540
And, uh...

1022
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,820
And, yeah.

1023
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,860
I don't want to, like, do too much to my voice today.

1024
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,780
Oh, guys.

1025
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,680
Let's get started.

1026
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,380
With Mario-man.

1027
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,300
Okay.

1028
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,060
Wait, I forgot to turn on the sound.

1029
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,480
But, yeah.

1030
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,520
I'm looking forward to seeing Dad again.

1031
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,160
It's been, like, a long time.

1032
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,240
I think it's been, like, almost a month since we last saw him.

1033
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,200
So, I do miss him a lot.

1034
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,280
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm in this, like, really fucked up city, too.

1036
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,880
Guys, thank you for the Magenta Super.

1037
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,620
Thank you.

1038
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,300
Thank you.

1039
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,900
It's been ten days since I was taking off the couch to play.

1040
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,140
Only come back to find out my couch occupied by a non-shiny bullet bill.

1041
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,860
And me stuck in the corner.

1042
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,300
At first, I was, um, indigent.

1043
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,160
But lately, I've started to enjoy this new place.

1044
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,420
It's just...

1045
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,780
Thank you for the Magenta Super.

1046
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,580
Thank you.

1047
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,400
Thank you.

1048
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,180
I really appreciate it.

1049
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,900
Uh, bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.

1050
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,640
Alright, let's go.

1051
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,220
Just enjoy your time.

1052
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,280
I don't remember where I've, like, interacted and talked to.

1053
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,820
Is it here?

1054
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,880
Oh, wait.

1055
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,220
That's the...

1056
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,840
Wait, where is this area?

1057
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,700
Wait, no, I don't...

1058
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,220
No!

1059
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,040
I accidentally...

1060
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,460
No!

1061
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,310
Did it...

1062
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,150
What a...

1063
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,290
I didn't...

1064
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,410
Oh!

1065
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,110
I accidentally spent my money.

1066
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,190
I don't...

1067
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,110
Oh, my God.

1068
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,570
God damn it.

1069
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,270
It's okay.

1070
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:05,990
I've made...

1071
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,970
I gotta learn from my mistakes.

1072
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,390
The music is too loud to get their attention.

1073
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,330
Guys, if I save Scum, then I'll never learn.

1074
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,710
You can't get Jimmy T's attention.

1075
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,870
He is grooving too hard.

1076
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:29,030
You ain't ever gonna owe it for all of this move and show him you know how to boogie at.

1077
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,470
You up for it, darling?

1078
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,290
Woo!

1079
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,890
Let's just go with the flow and you'll do great.

1080
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,090
Let's get groovy.

1081
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,710
Let's get groovy.

1082
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:42,830
Boom.

1083
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:43,550
Boom.

1084
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,130
Boom.

1085
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,530
Groovy!

1086
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:48,830
See?

1087
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,450
Even when brain rotted, I remember.

1088
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,590
Let's get groovy.

1089
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,330
Down.

1090
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,530
Right, right.

1091
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,110
Left.

1092
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:57,450
Oh.

1093
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,810
Yeah!

1094
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,750
Dance, dance, dance!

1095
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:05,810
Dance!

1096
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,810
Let's get groovy!

1097
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:10,970
Down.

1098
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,390
Left.

1099
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,230
Wait.

1100
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:12,850
Oh, wait.

1101
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,310
Oh.

1102
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,090
Okay, wait.

1103
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,130
I got this.

1104
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,810
That's right.

1105
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,990
Oh.

1106
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,210
That's right.

1107
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,810
You're a superstar, alright?

1108
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,690
Smooth moves, man.

1109
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,410
Jimmy T is waiting for you in the room ahead.

1110
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,370
Alright, yay!

1111
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,990
Hello, Jimmy T.

1112
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,870
Fight me!

1113
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,870
Mario.

1114
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,770
When was the last time you've been to Club Sugar?

1115
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,090
Honey?

1116
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,210
I remember you came for those breakdancing courses.

1117
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,070
I hope you still remember how.

1118
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,270
That's because Club Sugar hasn't changed a bit.

1119
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,550
Silly 24-7 party!

1120
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,970
What do you need, honey?

1121
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,710
You need a passcode for Wario Studio?

1122
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,510
Show me love on the dance floor, then!

1123
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,370
Let's get groovy, baby!

1124
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:14,890
That reminds me.

1125
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,930
I really want to watch Austin Powers again.

1126
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,690
Those movies age so well.

1127
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,970
They're still as fun.

1128
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,450
Like, I saw, like, a clip of it recently.

1129
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,090
I don't know.

1130
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,170
It just showed up in my YouTube.

1131
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,850
Yeah, it holds up really well.

1132
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,890
I saw it, like, a clip of it pop up in my YouTube algorithm.

1133
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,030
And, um...

1134
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,370
Oh, wait.

1135
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:40,790
Never mind.

1136
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,310
Okay, maybe some jokes are, like, a little bit more inappropriate now.

1137
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,250
Or, like, a lot really, really inappropriate.

1138
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,390
But, like, some of the jokes are still really, really funny.

1139
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,050
I just remembered.

1140
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,310
Um...

1141
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,470
Sorry, from the clips I watched...

1142
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,350
From the clips I watched...

1143
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,250
Uh...

1144
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,370
It may be a little dated.

1145
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,110
It may be a little dated in some moments.

1146
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:12,090
But some of the clips I watched were not those moments, but were the funny clips that aged well.

1147
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,410
Because I was thinking back, I was like, no, I think there were some very inappropriate jokes.

1148
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,930
But I saw two clips that popped up in my algorithm.

1149
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:29,790
And I saw two clips that popped up in my algorithm.

1150
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:39,750
And it was the part where it was a flashback to back when Austin Powers and Dr. Evil were in high school or some shit.

1151
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:46,070
And another one where it was Mini-Me and Austin Powers trying to find a map or some shit.

1152
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:51,270
And I was like, oh yeah, that's pretty funny.

1153
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,530
I need to watch those movies again.

1154
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:03,590
And like, I forgot that... I forgot that like, Dr. Evil and Austin Powers were both played by...

1155
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,930
What's his name?

1156
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,450
Was it Seth Meyers?

1157
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,670
That's the actor, right?

1158
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,750
Or the Shrek guy.

1159
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,910
We're both played by Shrek.

1160
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,250
And like, oh, Mike Meyers.

1161
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,650
Sorry, Seth Meyers.

1162
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,310
Sorry.

1163
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,690
Mike Meyers.

1164
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,790
I got confused.

1165
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,790
I was like, it was something Meyers.

1166
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,590
And I chose Seth because Seth likes Shrek.

1167
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,420
I was just thinking like...

1168
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,900
Oh yeah, Seth Green!

1169
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,760
I think I was thinking...

1170
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,100
Yeah, I was thinking of Seth Green and Mike Meyers at the same time.

1171
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,360
Because I know Seth Green was in the movie as well.

1172
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,760
But yeah, Dr. Evil and Austin Powers were both the same actor.

1173
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,940
And I forgot about that.

1174
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,580
I don't know, sir.

1175
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,460
But it looks like a giant.

1176
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,780
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

1177
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,460
Thank you, thank you.

1178
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,940
Maybe the members' good movie watch a lot.

1179
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,360
I may watch Austin Powers.

1180
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,120
Because it's been a long time since I watched Austin Powers.

1181
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,620
By the way, the very first time I watched Austin Powers...

1182
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,800
My... Wait, actually, let me look it up.

1183
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,240
My parents loved Austin Powers, by the way.

1184
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,320
My dad fucking loved that movie.

1185
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,540
Or the movie series.

1186
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,720
Like, he would do like, random quotes about like...

1187
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,620
He would do like, random Austin Powers quotes to me.

1188
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,860
When I was growing up.

1189
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,060
He'd be like, yeah, baby...

1190
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,680
Like, groovy, baby.

1191
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,800
Like, to me.

1192
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,700
And he's like...

1193
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,760
And then you know like, the Dr. Evil pose?

1194
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,500
Stuff?

1195
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,780
He would like, do that pose to me.

1196
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,440
And like...

1197
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,620
I just remember like...

1198
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,660
Like, if he wants to like, pretend to be Dr. Evil...

1199
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,360
Like, do something evil.

1200
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,880
Do the Dr. Evil pose to me.

1201
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,800
And stuff like that.

1202
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,700
Uh...

1203
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,720
Because he was like, obsessed with the movie.

1204
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,960
Yeah, the pinky pose.

1205
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1206
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,820
I didn't know when these movies...

1207
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,620
I didn't know when these movies released.

1208
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,060
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,940
So...

1210
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,980
Um...

1211
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,440
My parents loved the Austin Powers movie series so much.

1212
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,100
Um...

1213
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,780
They had all the DVDs back then.

1214
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,580
And then like, when the last Austin Powers movie that came out...

1215
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,520
They...

1216
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Took...

1217
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,580
Little me...

1218
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,520
To the movie theaters...

1219
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,680
To watch...

1220
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,280
The film.

1221
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,600
I have...

1222
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,500
No idea...

1223
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,480
How...

1224
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Legally...

1225
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,660
I was allowed to watch it.

1226
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,520
I...

1227
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,500
I was...

1228
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,720
Very little...

1229
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,860
When the last movie came out.

1230
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,920
And...

1231
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,220
And...

1232
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:34,740
And...

1233
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,800
I have like...

1234
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,100
Incredibly vague memories...

1235
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,020
Of like...

1236
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,860
Austin Powers in Goldmember.

1237
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:41,800
I have...

1238
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,180
Very vague memories of in the theater...

1239
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,940
Watching that movie with them.

1240
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,740
I don't...

1241
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,180
Like...

1242
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,320
But I have no idea...

1243
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,260
How...

1244
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,020
I was allowed in...

1245
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,600
To like...

1246
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,460
Be there.

1247
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,260
Because...

1248
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,600
I remember...

1249
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,490
Rewatching that...

1250
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,300
Um...

1251
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,040
In like...

1252
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,060
Middle school or something.

1253
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,200
And I was like...

1254
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,000
Wait a minute...

1255
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,280
This movie is incredibly inappropriate.

1256
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,460
Wait a minute...

1257
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,340
That explains a lot.

1258
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,770
Isn't this movie like...

1259
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,360
PG-13?

1260
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,460
As in...

1261
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,040
Like...

1262
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,420
Wait...

1263
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,300
Rating...

1264
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,620
I don't think a child should be allowed in...

1265
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,700
I don't...

1266
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,200
Um...

1267
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,880
Okay...

1268
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,420
Oh it is!

1269
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,640
It's PG-13.

1270
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,440
Does that mean like...

1271
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,340
Am I even...

1272
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,500
Are they allowed to...

1273
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:37,980
Oh wait...

1274
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,220
Unless there's a parent there.

1275
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:39,660
Yeah...

1276
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,520
It should be a...

1277
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,120
Fine, right?

1278
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,700
Like...

1279
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,020
Is it...

1280
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,740
Um...

1281
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,300
Mickey, thank you for the super chat.

1282
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:46,860
Thank you.

1283
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,580
Thank you.

1284
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,320
Just strongly cautioned.

1285
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:51,780
Um...

1286
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:51,920
Hey, Joe.

1287
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1288
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,260
Thank you.

1289
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,740
Thank you.

1290
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,780
I think the only thing that aged poorly about...

1291
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,520
Austin Powers...

1292
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,540
Was random task actor being convicted of bad things.

1293
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1294
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:02,780
Thank you.

1295
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,280
Thank you.

1296
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,840
Gus, you need to get a toggle for the pinky pose during the watch along.

1297
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1298
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,340
Thank you.

1299
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:08,900
Thank you.

1300
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,740
Alright.

1301
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,680
Let's keep...

1302
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,160
Sorry that...

1303
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,840
I don't know why...

1304
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,240
But like...

1305
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,420
When he started being like...

1306
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,660
It's groovy time.

1307
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,520
It just reminded me of Austin Powers.

1308
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,980
Alright.

1309
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,440
Oh, okey okey!

1310
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,520
O kiki, o kiki!

1311
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,980
You kiki?

1312
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,300
Was it o kiki or you kiki?

1313
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,560
Furious, thank you super chat, thank you thank you.

1314
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,160
It's a get in my belly!

1315
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,920
Seeing actually not to...

1316
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,120
to bore everything is bore.

1317
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,300
You think about it?

1318
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,340
Monkey!

1319
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,060
Alright, get it.

1320
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,960
Time for monkey to die.

1321
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,340
The world has too much, too many monkeys now.

1322
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,640
Yeah, it's... wait, is that... no, no, no, it's... wait, his... his mouth looks like balls.

1323
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,780
Sorry.

1324
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,420
We can never escape monkey.

1325
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,460
No.

1326
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,840
Dad will do it all.

1327
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,040
Thanks, Doki.

1328
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,220
Wait, how... oh wait, it's not doing a lot of damage.

1329
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,480
Uh, Masamun, Masamun, thank you for the super chat.

1330
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,420
Thank you, thank you.

1331
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,280
Hey, uh, it's my birthday today.

1332
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,840
And I'm still up at 3.52am.

1333
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,540
Getting a year older.

1334
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,860
Doki Walsker arrives tomorrow.

1335
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,240
Thanks for your streams.

1336
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:42,960
Or in German.

1337
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,920
Don't get for done streams.

1338
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,260
Greetings from Germany.

1339
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,620
Thank you for the super chat.

1340
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,640
Thank you, thank you.

1341
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm so happy you like my streams.

1342
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,500
And happy birthday to you.

1343
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,300
Happy birthday to you.

1344
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,160
Happy birthday to you.

1345
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,280
Happy birthday, dear Masu.

1346
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,020
Happy birthday to you.

1347
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,520
Happy birthday.

1348
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,120
Thank you.

1349
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh, we have a great birthday today.

1350
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,140
You go, Dad.

1351
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,360
Take all the XP.

1352
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,800
You know, like that meme where like, that family guy meme.

1353
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,460
I'm sorry.

1354
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,640
I want to do it.

1355
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,060
One day, I want to do a stream where I just do like, family guy cuts.

1356
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,440
It's like, remember the time when I...

1357
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:39,060
You guys remember the time when I, uh, played with Tyler1 and I just cut to like... Or like, I just make up random memories we've had.

1358
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,620
I'll be like, remember that time I like, saved an entire family from a burning building?

1359
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,920
Um, while in the middle of the stream?

1360
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,040
And then like, everyone was freaking out and then I just cut to that, like, cut to a reimagined scene of like, what...

1361
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,280
Of that happening?

1362
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,160
I just make a re... Like, I just like...

1363
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,520
Do like a fake scene cut of it.

1364
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,880
Like, where a fake stream moment with an editor.

1365
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,980
Where it seems like this might have happened.

1366
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,520
And you're like, did I forgot that?

1367
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,520
Like, was... It's like those... It's like the Rick and Morty opening where they insert fake episodes in the opening.

1368
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,380
And people will be like, wait, which one's from a real episode and which one isn't?

1369
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,040
And then I'll just like...

1370
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,260
And then I'll create like, fake...

1371
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,380
Like, make fake stream moments with an editor.

1372
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,040
And then it'll just make you second guess.

1373
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,080
I was like, wait, did this actually happen?

1374
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,520
It'll be from streams I've actually done.

1375
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
But like, from games I've actually done.

1376
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,540
But I just like, created a whole new moment in it.

1377
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,940
And you have to look back into the VOD and be like, did this actually happen?

1378
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,920
Or I'm like, fucking schizo right now.

1379
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,720
Am I like...

1380
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,900
Is this a bear-stained bear moment?

1381
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,680
Am I getting Mandela affected?

1382
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,760
I'm...

1383
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,020
Doki is cooking.

1384
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,520
Smooth moves, Mario.

1385
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,880
I would love to give you the whole passcode.

1386
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:21,880
Oh yeah, by the way, I was gonna say, it reminded me of that Family Guy episode where they cut to this actor eating like all the food and their family is starving.

1387
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,980
He's like, please father, can I also have a meal?

1388
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,620
Can I also have a bite?

1389
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,460
And he's like, no!

1390
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,680
It's all mine.

1391
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,420
That's dad with my other Mario mons.

1392
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,180
My other Mario mons is like, please Doki.

1393
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,020
Please Doki out.

1394
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,440
Let me fight.

1395
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,460
I want some XP too.

1396
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,100
And I'm like, no!

1397
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,180
Only dad gets to eat.

1398
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1399
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,240
You can have what's left.

1400
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,720
Ha ha ha ha.

1401
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,680
Yeah, Juno and Kiriko hoarding all the new skins.

1402
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,220
Oh yeah, I heard about the controversy with Juno being Chun-Li.

1403
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,900
People were like, what the fuck?

1404
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,860
Juno getting another skin from our collab?

1405
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,900
Ha ha ha ha.

1406
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,280
I'd love to give you the whole passcode by only no one word.

1407
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,640
The first word is Wario.

1408
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,120
But there's nothing left.

1409
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,080
There's always nothing left.

1410
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,980
Ha ha ha ha.

1411
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,160
I hope that helps.

1412
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,140
And come by Club Sugar.

1413
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,480
Whenever you feel like dancing.

1414
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:34,740
Honey.

1415
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,400
Mario found the first word to unlock WarioWare.

1416
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:41,660
Wario!

1417
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,320
Yay!

1418
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,620
Dance, dance.

1419
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,160
I love how...

1420
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,200
I like how the longer you yap, the more I know what your YouTube short speed is like.

1421
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,740
No, my YouTube short speed is unrelated to anything I talk about.

1422
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,020
It's actually...

1423
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,260
Okay, my...

1424
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,900
My YouTube shorts algorithm is so fucking fucked right now.

1425
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,820
And it's opposite to everything I talk about.

1426
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,620
It's the...

1427
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,120
Okay, I was gonna talk about this today.

1428
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Because I was just in my bed watching YouTube shorts all day.

1429
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,120
And like...

1430
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,200
This is what I get.

1431
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,120
I get...

1432
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,660
The guy from Japan eats talking about what food he eats every day.

1433
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,800
Like, each day he posts about the food he's getting.

1434
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,220
And then I get...

1435
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,540
Lego shorts.

1436
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,060
Where they talk like...

1437
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,480
Lego master builders.

1438
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,980
And like people talking about like...

1439
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,620
Like cool Lego figures.

1440
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,980
And then I also get...

1441
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,300
I also get like...

1442
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,180
Random dance videos.

1443
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,440
Of the newest like dance trend.

1444
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,380
So like...

1445
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,640
Right now I've been getting non-stop shorts.

1446
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,860
Of the...

1447
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,720
It's that one.

1448
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,040
I don't remember that song.

1449
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,020
I don't remember the lyrics.

1450
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,500
Like...

1451
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,960
If you guys know what I'm talking about.

1452
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,700
It's...

1453
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,340
It's that fucking song.

1454
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,140
I...

1455
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,400
It's like...

1456
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,640
Something blue jeans.

1457
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,820
Um...

1458
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,560
Oh my god.

1459
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,060
What now?

1460
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,460
Now I need to figure it out.

1461
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,440
Um...

1462
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,760
Blue jeans.

1463
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,600
A song.

1464
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,680
What was it?

1465
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,620
Oh my god.

1466
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,000
From...

1467
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,440
Guy that likes to flip.

1468
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,000
All right.

1469
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,540
What was it?

1470
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,420
Senior that likes to do flips.

1471
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,620
During Grammys.

1472
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,820
You know.

1473
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,720
You know that.

1474
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,120
Okay.

1475
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,200
Benson Boone.

1476
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,060
There he is.

1477
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,680
Okay.

1478
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,040
Sorry.

1479
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,560
It had...

1480
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,080
It had to be really specific.

1481
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,940
Because all this guy does.

1482
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,760
Whenever he has to perform...

1483
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,980
Like how someone's like...

1484
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,220
Whenever this guy...

1485
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,100
Performs.

1486
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,520
He does like...

1487
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,680
Somersaults and flips.

1488
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,440
Every time.

1489
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,280
So I had to like...

1490
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,200
I had to get really specific.

1491
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
It's very memorable.

1492
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:58,700
Uh...

1493
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,740
Newest song.

1494
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:01,620
All right.

1495
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,320
So...

1496
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,940
My...

1497
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,240
One of my YouTube algorithm...

1498
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,400
Is...

1499
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,340
Um...

1500
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,400
Um...

1501
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,600
Is...

1502
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,240
Mystical.

1503
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,560
Oh yeah.

1504
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,500
Mystical.

1505
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,820
Magical.

1506
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,280
Ba-ba-ba.

1507
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,780
Like that's in my...

1508
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,060
That's been in my YouTube feed.

1509
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,540
Like that fucking song.

1510
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,260
With various different skits.

1511
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,220
And like...

1512
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,100
Interpretations.

1513
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:23,740
And trend.

1514
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,840
Has been on my YouTube feed.

1515
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,020
For like...

1516
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,380
The past week now.

1517
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,200
Like...

1518
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,380
It's always that song.

1519
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,400
I...

1520
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,980
But it's always like...

1521
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,100
Okay.

1522
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,740
Where is it?

1523
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,180
Where...

1524
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,740
I need to know.

1525
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,120
Huh.

1526
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,200
Moon beam.

1527
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,180
Ice cream.

1528
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,080
Taking off your blue jeans.

1529
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,880
Dancing at the movies.

1530
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,980
Cause it feels so...

1531
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,580
Mystical.

1532
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,740
Magical.

1533
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,040
Oh baby.

1534
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:50,900
Like...

1535
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,020
It...

1536
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,700
It's just that part.

1537
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,460
It's just that part.

1538
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,280
And it can't...

1539
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,800
I...

1540
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,540
There's so many clips.

1541
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,720
And now...

1542
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,900
Now today...

1543
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,720
It's like...

1544
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,240
It's like there's a new song now.

1545
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,760
That keeps playing.

1546
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:04,740
Uh...

1547
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,400
Now people are using this other short.

1548
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:06,740
So I mean...

1549
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,080
I need to...

1550
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,680
I know what...

1551
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,660
I need to know what this is.

1552
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,720
I need to know.

1553
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,680
Oh.

1554
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,620
It was like...

1555
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,400
What is it?

1556
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:13,780
Okay.

1557
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:13,960
Wait.

1558
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,340
There's this new song today.

1559
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,520
It's this one.

1560
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:16,720
Okay.

1561
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:16,900
Wait.

1562
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,160
Oh.

1563
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,120
You can ask the flowers.

1564
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,140
I sit for hours.

1565
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,440
Telling all the bluebirds.

1566
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,340
The building cool birds.

1567
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,360
That's today.

1568
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:35,900
I literally went through 10 shorts in a row using that song on my YouTube shorts algorithm.

1569
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:36,960
I...

1570
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,280
It's been...

1571
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,680
I was scrolling.

1572
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,020
And I was just like...

1573
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,960
It was 10 shorts in a row.

1574
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,320
It was like...

1575
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,900
You can ask the flowers.

1576
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,100
I sit for hours.

1577
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,460
Telling all the bluebirds.

1578
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,420
The building cool birds.

1579
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,040
Like, it was literally that.

1580
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,620
Like, every time.

1581
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,860
Like...

1582
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,940
I was like, please.

1583
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,600
I love these song trends.

1584
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,880
Because they're like really catchy.

1585
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,440
But I don't need it 10 times in a fucking row.

1586
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,220
I already healed him.

1587
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,080
I forgot.

1588
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,820
I already healed you.

1589
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,500
Sorry.

1590
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,140
I had...

1591
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,240
When I'm like more brain caught...

1592
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,740
My brain is jammed.

1593
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,500
I...

1594
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,840
I get very easily distracted now.

1595
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,000
Also, I need to show you the monkey again.

1596
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,880
What is it?

1597
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,860
Oh, it's...

1598
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,500
Uh...

1599
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,040
Ukiki.

1600
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,660
Where are you, Ukiki?

1601
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,060
Because I told you.

1602
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,680
His mouth looks like balls.

1603
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,900
And you guys are like...

1604
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,940
What the fuck, Doki?

1605
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,780
And I'm like...

1606
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,340
It's true.

1607
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,160
Look at it.

1608
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,820
Does it not look like a ball?

1609
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,600
Two balls?

1610
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,100
Like...

1611
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,440
Dominic.

1612
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1613
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,240
Thank you.

1614
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:55,920
Thank you.

1615
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,920
I was driving at work this week.

1616
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,860
My brain says...

1617
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,400
Doki bird.

1618
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,260
Dinkle bird.

1619
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,340
Dinkle bird.

1620
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,800
You're a dinkle bird now.

1621
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,820
Thank you for the super chat.

1622
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,260
Thank you.

1623
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:04,920
Thank you.

1624
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,740
Oh, I guess it looks like a butt.

1625
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,620
I guess.

1626
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,560
But I think it just looks like two balls.

1627
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,800
A palm.

1628
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,880
I can't see it now.

1629
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,460
Thank you for the super chat.

1630
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:20,820
Thank you.

1631
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,380
Thank you.

1632
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,760
Doki face.

1633
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
Can you show us your shock face me while wearing a mustache?

1634
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,520
I'm gonna die if I see it.

1635
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,040
Alright, sure.

1636
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,860
I don't do anything for money.

1637
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,500
That's right.

1638
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,740
I'm shameless.

1639
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,140
Thank you for the super chat.

1640
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:38,460
Thank you.

1641
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,060
Thank you.

1642
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:39,940
Thank you.

1643
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,660
I love myself out of Oshiii.

1644
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,280
Okay, I need to know where the fucking last place is that I'm supposed to go.

1645
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:53,840
Is it here?

1646
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,360
That's the department store.

1647
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,100
I'm so lost.

1648
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,800
Is it...

1649
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,380
Here?

1650
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,140
Oh, no.

1651
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:02,780
That's the...

1652
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,380
Wait, did you guys make another baby?

1653
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,340
How?

1654
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,220
Oh, my...

1655
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,700
I left for like...

1656
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,360
Oh, my God.

1657
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,060
Okay, you guys...

1658
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:09,560
Yeah, no.

1659
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,180
You're gonna make...

1660
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,740
Oh, my God.

1661
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,300
You guys made another baby?

1662
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,860
No, I already did Ashley's Mansion.

1663
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,600
I already did that one.

1664
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,300
Oh.

1665
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,260
Oh, the park is really popular after hours.

1666
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,780
You know anyone else playing...

1667
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,560
Oh, Pyromon?

1668
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,160
I need to trade my Pyroro for a Pyroro.

1669
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,640
Have you tried that new Pyromon game?

1670
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,960
If you do, tell me how it is.

1671
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,140
I can't let go of Super Mario Bros.

1672
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,740
3 yet.

1673
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,880
Well, I love to make micro games, but I'm a bigger fan of macro games.

1674
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,480
Like Super Mario Bros.

1675
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:39,820
3.

1676
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,540
Oh, I found a Bros Bean.

1677
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,000
Legally distinct.

1678
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,360
Uh...

1679
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,080
Uh...

1680
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,860
Wario Mon.

1681
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,240
This is my zone!

1682
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,420
Okay.

1683
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,240
What does Yoshi want to say?

1684
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,680
Some nice thing you forget about your worries and roll around in a puddle.

1685
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,380
I like to give people rides around the playground.

1686
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,660
You're a little too big for me.

1687
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,500
Are you trying...

1688
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,480
What are you trying to say?

1689
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:07,980
Huh?

1690
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,020
Huh?

1691
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,160
The other Yoshis could carry my weight.

1692
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,600
You're just weak.

1693
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,260
I tried eating raw garlic from above?

1694
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,800
Yeah, I do not recommend.

1695
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,440
Yeah, I'll just share up.

1696
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,200
I don't know what that is, but I'll put it in my pocket.

1697
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:37,810
That reminded me of, like, that game we had where that guy was like...

1698
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,930
He was like, you know, he's like, don't worry.

1699
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:44,850
I can say it.

1700
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,430
I used to be fat, too.

1701
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,170
He's like, I got the pass.

1702
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:59,910
I thought I was paying more for a nicer house here in the suburbs.

1703
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:02,370
In reality, they're all the same inside.

1704
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,530
My purple coins from World Fort are useless outside the casino.

1705
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,890
You know, oh boy, this is the worst of the time I visited Daisy's castle.

1706
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,990
And then we're just like, whoa, what do you mean by that?

1707
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,250
Because he was like, I was also this, too.

1708
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,790
But now I'm just this and not fat anymore.

1709
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,450
So I just hate...

1710
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,830
I was like, what the fuck?

1711
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,950
I'm a try.

1712
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:32,590
Oh, yeah.

1713
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,430
I was just like, Jesus.

1714
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:36,870
Bro, I wish I had a cart to ride.

1715
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,630
And he's like, it's okay.

1716
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,490
I used to be fat once.

1717
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,450
So I could say it.

1718
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:43,930
And I was like, Jesus.

1719
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,970
Oh, my God.

1720
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,670
Rink is crazy.

1721
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,290
It makes it so easy to get around Diamond City.

1722
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,010
All right.

1723
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:59,710
I'm trying to find the area I was supposed to go to.

1724
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,310
Let's say you still don't have all three.

1725
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,090
The third...

1726
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,570
Where is the third town?

1727
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:10,970
Where is that...

1728
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:11,890
The third town?

1729
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,890
See, this is what you missed from the 12-hour vibe.

1730
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,910
Mario, be careful.

1731
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,230
This world is not what it seems.

1732
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,010
Question everything.

1733
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,470
What the fuck?

1734
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,270
Is that a fourth wall break?

1735
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,530
Oh, my God.

1736
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,890
He's trying to tell me that I'm in a video game.

1737
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,470
Where is the last area?

1738
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,410
I did...

1739
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,070
Oh, wait.

1740
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,890
I didn't do...

1741
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,710
I'm stupid.

1742
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,510
I didn't do Ashley's mansion.

1743
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,790
I'm so dumb.

1744
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:45,810
I forgot.

1745
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:46,970
I did...

1746
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,710
I did the...

1747
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,110
Sorry.

1748
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,070
I did the other girl's thing.

1749
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,230
The lab instead of the mansion.

1750
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,790
Took you long enough.

1751
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:56,490
Come on.

1752
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:57,090
Sorry.

1753
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:58,710
I got you confused with the other girl.

1754
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,430
Oh, it seems to forget...

1755
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,550
He forgot to...

1756
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,330
Cap jump.

1757
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,970
Red, can you keep an eye on Mario?

1758
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,490
Of course, Miss Ashley.

1759
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:14,410
Oh?

1760
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:18,870
It seems to be on the switch on the back of the statue.

1761
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:19,750
Press it?

1762
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:20,950
Okay.

1763
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,130
Not too difficult.

1764
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,570
Trying to depart so quickly, huh?

1765
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,930
Oh, there's new encounters here?

1766
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:31,690
Okay, nice.

1767
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,790
Oh, this is where I can catch the ghost Pokemon.

1768
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,290
Because it's Ashley's mansion.

1769
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,270
Bring that back.

1770
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,850
Oh my god, you thief.

1771
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,490
I knew you can't trust ghosts.

1772
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,570
You're all the same.

1773
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:50,290
All right.

1774
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:51,090
I forgot.

1775
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,670
I accidentally used a fighting move.

1776
00:59:59,100 --> 00:59:59,660
Let's do it.

1777
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,390
Ah!

1778
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,570
You level up too.

1779
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,090
Husky gone.

1780
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:09,470
All right.

1781
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:10,170
Oh, Eerie.

1782
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:10,850
What's that?

1783
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,390
Oh!

1784
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,210
That's so cute!

1785
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,350
Wait, I recognize this is on.

1786
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,570
Wait, I want him!

1787
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,350
I'm gonna steal it!

1788
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,950
I wish I could use like a shadow ball.

1789
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,250
Oh my god, he hurt himself.

1790
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,830
Curse is such a badass move.

1791
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,050
Oh, you're stupid.

1792
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,650
This is like me trying to use self-destruct.

1793
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,320
The rest of your team is getting the XP.

1794
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:47,980
Yeah!

1795
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,800
Bro, like...

1796
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,940
I just want...

1797
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,300
Okay.

1798
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,800
I need a...

1799
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,660
I want to catch a ghost Pokemon.

1800
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,140
No.

1801
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,380
I don't want to be in there.

1802
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,520
Put me back in here.

1803
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,260
Fight me.

1804
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,160
What?

1805
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,140
Where is it?

1806
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,280
I'm not encountering anything.

1807
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,300
Are all the ghosts afraid of me?

1808
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,080
How does...

1809
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,560
He has like five mons?

1810
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,620
That's illegal.

1811
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,740
You're just an NPC.

1812
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,420
Who gave you the...

1813
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,880
NPCs are only allowed to have three or less.

1814
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,500
Oh, they're...

1815
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,440
They were pretty weak though.

1816
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,220
It's like that bug trainer that has six mons.

1817
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,520
And they were all like level two.

1818
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,750
I wonder like...

1819
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:46,550
What happens?

1820
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,750
If you like...

1821
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,330
I wish like Pokemon...

1822
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:52,110
Wait, no.

1823
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:52,790
That's Team Rocket.

1824
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,870
I wonder...

1825
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:55,430
I was like...

1826
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:56,270
What if I just...

1827
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:56,810
You know...

1828
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,870
Just steal your Pokemon.

1829
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,090
And I was like...

1830
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,350
That's what Team Rocket does.

1831
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:03,710
That's...

1832
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:04,550
That's the whole...

1833
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,470
That's what Team Rocket...

1834
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,730
The whole thing about Team Rocket.

1835
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,390
Where all they do is just steal Pokemon.

1836
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,330
That's... death.

1837
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,190
Oh my god, I was wondering, like...

1838
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:22,250
You know how, like, I was like, how do you, like, cat, like, you know...

1839
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,890
How do you, like, um... report that?

1840
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,810
Is it, like, a missing persons report?

1841
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:34,090
I feel like, maybe, like, Pokeballs are, like, hardwired to the Pokemon.

1842
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,570
So you cannot transfer a Pokemon to a different ball.

1843
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,830
And it's, like, you know, like, find my iPhone?

1844
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,370
It's, like, find my Pokemon.

1845
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,090
So, like, if you lost your Pokemon somewhere...

1846
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:49,110
Like, what if you, like, left your Pokemon... Pokeball on a bench or something.

1847
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,010
And then you just forgot to pick it up.

1848
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,530
And, like, you know, how are you gonna get it back?

1849
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,130
Then, like, like, you just, you know, it just dropped out of your pants.

1850
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,090
And everything.

1851
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,970
So, like, how do you get back your Pokemon?

1852
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:02,310
Pokemon!

1853
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:03,950
It's gonna be in that Pokemon!

1854
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:10,430
And I was like thinking, oh my god, what if they have this thing like, find my Pokemon, and it's like a little phone app and everything.

1855
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,810
And then you just like go like, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1856
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:14,630
Hahaha!

1857
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,290
You're almost there!

1858
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:17,410
Hahaha!

1859
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,090
Hahaha!

1860
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,930
And I'm like thinking, like, wouldn't they be like, microchipped too?

1861
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,610
You know how like dogs are microchipped?

1862
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,670
So wouldn't you like, microchip your mom?

1863
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,730
To like, find it?

1864
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,250
Alright.

1865
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,850
Yeah, to prevent robbery, exactly!

1866
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:42,470
Microchip this guy!

1867
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,950
No, it's like implanted on the Pokeball!

1868
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:49,410
And then I guess you can like, microchip like, directly in it.

1869
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,770
Yeah, get that Pokemon chipped.

1870
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,330
So you don't lose it.

1871
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:03,550
Okay, but like, who made the rules that- Oh, I forgot, that's the same.

1872
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,930
Wait, that's a ghost?

1873
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:09,010
Wait, there's a ghost version of me?

1874
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,250
Oh no, it's a duplicate!

1875
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,810
Okay, I was gonna be like, wait, I'm fighting myself?

1876
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,490
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

1877
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:23,870
Thank you.

1878
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:24,410
Thank you.

1879
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,570
John and Manny, we saw what she made you do.

1880
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,450
And we want to tell you it's not okay.

1881
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,030
Thank you for the super chat.

1882
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:30,330
Thank you.

1883
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:30,970
Thank you.

1884
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,730
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

1885
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,050
Thank you.

1886
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,630
Thank you.

1887
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:38,550
Most people... Most Pokemon have, like, human intelligence, far as I remember.

1888
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,310
But just don't have a language knowledge.

1889
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:46,570
So they wouldn't want to find you just as much if you were a good mommy for them.

1890
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,530
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1891
01:04:49,050 --> 01:05:00,510
Wait, if they have, like, human intelligence, and we, like, keep them in Pokeballs, and, like, make them do... Like, oh, my first encounter.

1892
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,650
I should not have continued that thought, anyway.

1893
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,250
That's a good place to stop.

1894
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,110
The game was, like, stop!

1895
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:16,790
It finally let me encounter another... a wild mod.

1896
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:21,110
And the game was, like, stop that thought right now!

1897
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,810
Look at this wild mod we gave you!

1898
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,190
Yay!

1899
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,370
I want it, Eerie!

1900
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:45,590
No!

1901
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:46,770
Don't!

1902
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,490
Don't kill yourself!

1903
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:50,630
No!

1904
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:56,850
Okay.

1905
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:57,610
That's good.

1906
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:58,190
That's good.

1907
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:58,950
That's good.

1908
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,590
You can't die twice!

1909
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,310
Isn't it, like... Okay, there you go.

1910
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,870
I'm trying to capture you!

1911
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,450
So you spend your whole life on a PC!

1912
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,690
Don't worry, it'll feel just... Oh, no!

1913
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:16,710
No!

1914
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,500
Oh, no, it's okay.

1915
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:28,070
No!

1916
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,030
No!

1917
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,090
No!

1918
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,990
Please!

1919
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:33,110
Please!

1920
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:37,430
I'm sad.

1921
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,200
Alright.

1922
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,120
You guys are lucky I'm not doing a Nuzlocke.

1923
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,560
I don't understand!

1924
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:01,100
I don't understand!

1925
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,480
Why won't you want to be caught?

1926
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,820
I don't understand!

1927
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,040
Life is so good in your Pokeball!

1928
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,080
What?

1929
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,020
Depressed ghost.

1930
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,060
Alright, let us...

1931
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,940
Alright, we got... At least we got gas mouse.

1932
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,340
Ghost mouse.

1933
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:30,580
Fudge!

1934
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,680
Thank you for the super chat!

1935
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,520
Thank you, thank you!

1936
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,720
Reminder that Pokemon the world's only source of...

1937
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,020
Oh, yeah!

1938
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:35,560
They are!

1939
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,120
Wait, so do you catch them?

1940
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,480
To, like, use them as poultry?

1941
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:45,080
Or, like, are they just wild moths that you just go chop chop?

1942
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,280
I saw that on, like, one of the official comics where they chopped up a Zubat.

1943
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,920
So there's, like, you know, like, we have cat...

1944
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,440
Oh, yeah, like, the milk tank farms.

1945
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,540
And when the milk tank gets too old...

1946
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:09,540
Chop chop!

1947
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:09,620
Chop!

1948
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,400
I'm wondering...

1949
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:13,540
Wait!

1950
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,780
Can male milk tanks also make milk?

1951
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,080
I'm wondering...

1952
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,640
Oh, today's stream is fucking wild.

1953
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,440
Lots of dragoons are missing out today.

1954
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,980
Wait, there's no male...

1955
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,770
Oh, there isn't?

1956
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,240
I didn't realize they're gender...

1957
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,240
Oh, I didn't realize.

1958
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,960
Milk tanks are only coming female form.

1959
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,540
The wandering spirit of a mouse, its physical form is weak and can be dispersed effortlessly.

1960
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,660
It inhabits old hallways and rooms in spooky mansions.

1961
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,080
You know what this mouse reminds me of?

1962
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,660
The fact that they said that its physical form is weak and can be dispersed effortlessly?

1963
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:21,890
Now you're in the X sound box.

1964
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,470
No!

1965
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:25,470
No!

1966
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,260
No!

1967
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,520
No!

1968
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,020
No!

1969
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,940
Oh.

1970
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:40,080
That's cool!

1971
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,840
Alright...

1972
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,580
Let's see...

1973
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,360
Where's the Pokemon Center?

1974
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,440
Oh my god, that's... sorry.

1975
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,020
I thought... I saw red?

1976
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,260
My brain was like, red, Pokemon Center.

1977
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,460
And that's like the only thing I registered during that.

1978
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,640
I literally just saw red.

1979
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,780
Where the fuck is the Pokemon Center?

1980
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,040
It's up here, right?

1981
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,140
Oh yeah, it's right here.

1982
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,040
I was watching by color.

1983
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:27,130
Sorry, Mario Mon Center.

1984
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,500
Alright.

1985
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,940
This is what it's like when I have no filter today.

1986
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,740
I just say all my intrusive thoughts.

1987
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,400
Hope I don't get in trouble.

1988
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,760
Alright, we gotta go back down here.

1989
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,600
Ah, Eerie!

1990
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,380
Eerie!

1991
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,480
Nice!

1992
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,340
Oh, wait, I...

1993
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,340
Wait, actually...

1994
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,080
Where's my...

1995
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,020
I need to get rid of one of you.

1996
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,620
Eerie's cute.

1997
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:10,960
Alright.

1998
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,560
Lick.

1999
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,400
That's right.

2000
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,420
Oh, it's super effective!

2001
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,740
Wait, what?

2002
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,300
Okay, nice.

2003
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,520
Okay, this time...

2004
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,680
This time you'll get in my ball, right?

2005
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,940
You'll get in my cap.

2006
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,740
Get in there.

2007
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,300
Wait, no.

2008
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,500
Wait, why don't you wanna be...

2009
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,000
What?

2010
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,440
Why don't you wanna be part of my team?

2011
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,860
I'll put you in my party.

2012
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,500
Don't worry.

2013
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,820
You don't have to see what's going on in the exile chamber.

2014
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,180
No.

2015
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,260
When it...

2016
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:02,660
The people that come out of the exile chamber were never the same after.

2017
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:18,300
A ghostly dinosaur that roams around aimlessly is rather docile and often inflicts damage when others interacted with it by... Oh wait, that's so strong.

2018
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,500
Right, Snap.

2019
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,640
Thank you for the super chat.

2020
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:21,980
Thank you.

2021
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:22,760
Thank you.

2022
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,240
Are we still doing chat names?

2023
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,060
Also delivered for you in stream time.

2024
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,500
What is it?

2025
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,860
I want to see.

2026
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,620
What's the delivery?

2027
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2028
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,700
Thank you.

2029
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,780
What is it?

2030
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,280
Wait.

2031
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,040
There's nothing there.

2032
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,620
Am I missing it?

2033
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,680
Where is it?

2034
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,020
Wait, am I looking at the wrong tag?

2035
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,500
Oh, no.

2036
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,040
Am I looking at the wrong tag, guys?

2037
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,560
Oh, wait.

2038
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,540
Is it that one?

2039
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:14,920
Oh.

2040
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:23,210
I see it.

2041
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,510
I see it, guys.

2042
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:32,850
I got you, Toki.

2043
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,510
Retweet it.

2044
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:35,090
Yeah.

2045
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:47,310
I'm going to use that the next time I play Marvel Rivals.

2046
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:49,730
That's going to be my thumbnail.

2047
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,470
That's it.

2048
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:57,010
That's it.

2049
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,450
For those who are wondering what it was.

2050
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:01,270
Here you go.

2051
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:01,970
Here you go.

2052
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,110
I was looking at...

2053
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,170
I was looking at...

2054
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:05,190
...Doki Gallery.

2055
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,070
Don't worry.

2056
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:08,830
I got you.

2057
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,390
That's definitely going to be my next...

2058
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:13,230
...Marvel Rivals thumbnail.

2059
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,090
I'll make sure of it.

2060
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,790
Also, is the music...

2061
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:23,670
Is the sound okay?

2062
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,450
Because I'm not talking as loud as my usual...

2063
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,410
...as usual.

2064
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:30,830
Just because, you know, my voice is...

2065
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,430
...a bit needs a little rest.

2066
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:33,710
All right.

2067
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:34,270
Yeah.

2068
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,930
All right.

2069
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:35,910
Don't worry, Rice.

2070
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:37,810
Put you in...

2071
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,130
I'll put you as eerie.

2072
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:42,150
Rice.

2073
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,650
Goon.

2074
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:49,570
Okay, nice.

2075
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:51,310
Yeah.

2076
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,530
So cute.

2077
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,050
I like that.

2078
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,950
I like that Mario mod.

2079
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,730
Is there any more encounters in this area?

2080
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,750
Or is that it?

2081
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:06,070
I wonder.

2082
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,490
What did I do for this one?

2083
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:16,090
Is the sound...

2084
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,070
Poo!

2085
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:20,350
This is what I wanted in the first place.

2086
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:22,890
Oh my god.

2087
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,310
I wanted a poo.

2088
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:28,950
Finally.

2089
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:34,470
Hey, bat.

2090
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,950
Now lick him.

2091
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,710
That's right.

2092
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:43,390
That's right.

2093
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,450
Lick him.

2094
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:50,650
Dragoon is like, I'm tired of licking things!

2095
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,200
Alright, get in my plumber cap.

2096
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,640
No!

2097
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,220
Bull was caught!

2098
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,180
That gains 78 EXP points.

2099
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,220
Yeah!

2100
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:15,800
A long tongue of spirit inhabits a long abandoned home and corner stores.

2101
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,520
It vanishes when looked at.

2102
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,480
Seeing what is considered something to brag about.

2103
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,380
Wait, did I use wisp goons yet?

2104
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,860
Did I do wisp goons?

2105
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:24,660
I don't even remember.

2106
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,000
I caught so many.

2107
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,620
I'm losing track.

2108
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,080
Alright, this is gonna be a wisp goon.

2109
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,260
Because I think it's perfect for it.

2110
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:35,560
Wisp...

2111
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:38,060
Goon.

2112
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:38,920
Alright!

2113
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,320
Bye, wisp goon.

2114
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,960
I'm never gonna see you again.

2115
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,280
Goodbye.

2116
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,760
Into the exile chamber you go.

2117
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,580
Where you'll see the horrors.

2118
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,340
Mario!

2119
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,780
Got it quickly!

2120
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,180
No matter what.

2121
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,460
In order to proceed, you'll have to face a gauntlet of challenge.

2122
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,280
Jizz, are you prepared?

2123
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:16,740
Perfect.

2124
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:21,750
Perfect.

2125
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,130
Follow the movements of this toad.

2126
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,290
Which toad was?

2127
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:28,390
The blue one, middle.

2128
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:29,650
Yeah!

2129
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,350
Oh, well, you won't get the next one so easily.

2130
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,630
Follow the movement of this toad.

2131
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:40,350
Middle.

2132
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,070
Yeah!

2133
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:45,690
Oh, well, you won't get the next one so easily.

2134
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,110
I swear, if this is all just middle.

2135
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:50,570
Okay, this one's left.

2136
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:51,890
Alright.

2137
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:53,450
Oh, my God.

2138
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:54,410
That's so easy.

2139
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:56,850
Correct!

2140
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,370
Oh, well, you won't get the next one so easily.

2141
01:17:59,510 --> 01:17:59,670
Wait.

2142
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,490
Alright, make sure you pay attention to what you're about to see.

2143
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,090
What am I about to see?

2144
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,150
Oh, this is like the minigames in...

2145
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,530
Oh, I was not paying attention.

2146
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,410
I looked at chat.

2147
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,830
What's a sniff it?

2148
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,430
Is it the one guy?

2149
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:18,310
The...

2150
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,610
Wait.

2151
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:20,470
What?

2152
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,690
Oh, it's the guy with the longer nose, right?

2153
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:31,390
Three, two, four, six, seven.

2154
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:32,910
Okay, three to seven.

2155
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:33,570
Three, seven.

2156
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,530
Oh, it's three.

2157
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,190
Do it again!

2158
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,890
I assume it was the guy with the longer nose just because he had like...

2159
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:43,270
Two, four, six, uh, seven.

2160
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,030
Okay, three, seven.

2161
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,610
Because like, you know, it had a longer mask.

2162
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,890
Oh, seven.

2163
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:51,290
Yeah!

2164
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:52,950
I know what shy guys are.

2165
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,850
Next one, you won't win so easily on the next one.

2166
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:57,510
That's it.

2167
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:59,250
Time for the ultimate test.

2168
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:04,070
Luigi!

2169
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:06,650
Huh?

2170
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:08,030
Where did he go?

2171
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,390
Hey, where's Luigi?

2172
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:15,970
Wait, what?

2173
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:18,330
What?

2174
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:20,710
What?

2175
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:23,810
I don't understand this one.

2176
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:28,980
Oh!

2177
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,360
Oh!

2178
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,080
Yes.

2179
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,140
Wait, what?

2180
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,280
I...

2181
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,920
Was that not the shiny sparkle?

2182
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,290
Oh, I see it.

2183
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:47,790
I see it.

2184
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,890
Oh my god.

2185
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:49,590
It was...

2186
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,730
I thought it was like the...

2187
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:57,090
There's so many of them that the sparkle is like hard to see because there's so many things going on.

2188
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:57,750
What?

2189
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:58,350
How?

2190
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:01,490
I gotta tell Miss Ashley about this right away.

2191
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,490
She's gonna be so upset.

2192
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:07,010
The sparkle looked like it was on the chair.

2193
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:08,790
That's why I was like, what the fuck?

2194
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,470
Yeah, it looked like it was...

2195
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:17,410
I thought that it was on the chair because it looked like it was on it.

2196
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:19,870
Miss Ashley!

2197
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,610
Mario made it!

2198
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:22,430
Huh?

2199
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:23,910
Of course he did.

2200
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:26,750
I know how this goes.

2201
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,310
Are you sure you want to fight?

2202
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:31,050
I can give you the passcode and we can move on.

2203
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:31,910
No.

2204
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,890
Wait, I actually want to see what your mons are like.

2205
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,110
Okay, you're lost.

2206
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:39,530
I want to see your mons.

2207
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,370
I want to know.

2208
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,230
I also need the XP too.

2209
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:42,530
I forgot.

2210
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,150
Wait, that's so cute.

2211
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,390
I want to be a...

2212
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,610
I want to be a ghost mon trainer.

2213
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:52,510
Wait, that's so cute.

2214
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:56,490
Oh my god, he's so chubby.

2215
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:59,070
I want to pop it.

2216
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,810
I feel like the ghost ones have all the cute designs.

2217
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,690
Yeah.

2218
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,690
I'll pop those puff cheeks.

2219
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:13,370
Yay, number 20.

2220
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,130
Psybeam?

2221
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,190
Oh wait, Psybeam is good.

2222
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,570
Uh, I'll get rid of Supersonic.

2223
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:23,430
I'm never going to use that anyway.

2224
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:31,090
Like, all the ghost ones in Mario Mon have, like, such cute designs.

2225
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,350
All right, nice.

2226
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:38,170
Bruiser?

2227
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:39,550
What does that one look like?

2228
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:41,770
Oh!

2229
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,370
It's the Ashley song!

2230
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,830
I just noticed!

2231
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:49,510
Remember the song I sent you guys with the jazz version of it?

2232
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,750
Yeah, it's the theme.

2233
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:53,790
It's the theme.

2234
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:55,910
I just noticed.

2235
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:24,570
I like that song.

2236
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:27,850
All right.

2237
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:31,650
You can't flinch me forever.

2238
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:39,910
I don't know.

2239
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:41,590
I really like her theme song.

2240
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:42,510
I've...

2241
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,130
I've actually never played WarioWare before.

2242
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:47,410
Confession time.

2243
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:51,290
Mad Piano?

2244
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,330
Oh, that's from Mario 64!

2245
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,090
I recognize it.

2246
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:00,510
Oh!

2247
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,350
You know, okay, there's one game that I've been meaning to...

2248
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:07,110
It's not Mario related or Nintendo related.

2249
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:08,430
But...

2250
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:13,270
I really want to play the really fucked up Sonic trilogy game.

2251
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:15,050
Where it was like...

2252
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:20,150
It was like the most random shit they decided to put Sonic in.

2253
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:23,410
Where there was the one where he like becomes a knight.

2254
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:26,030
And then there's another one where he becomes a...

2255
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:27,270
Where he's like a werewolf.

2256
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:28,130
Or...

2257
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:29,890
Or...

2258
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:30,310
Yeah.

2259
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:31,150
Yeah.

2260
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:33,230
Yeah.

2261
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:34,350
Yeah, the Sonic...

2262
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:34,830
Black...

2263
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:36,210
Yeah, I actually was like...

2264
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:36,910
Oh my god.

2265
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,390
I still really want to...

2266
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:39,830
Play the storybook...

2267
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,870
Yeah, the storybook trilogy.

2268
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:44,970
Yeah, I was like...

2269
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:46,670
Thinking about it recently.

2270
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:47,170
I was like...

2271
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,710
Man, when do I want to play it?

2272
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:49,110
This...

2273
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:50,770
I've never played those games before.

2274
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:51,810
But I've heard like...

2275
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:52,590
It's like...

2276
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:53,310
Fucking weird.

2277
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:54,710
It's like...

2278
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,490
It's where like...

2279
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:56,730
Sonic got a little weird.

2280
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:59,350
A little edgy.

2281
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,640
Yeah, I want to play the trilogy and the werehog.

2282
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,270
The third word is...

2283
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:16,470
Win!

2284
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:17,790
Now, be gone!

2285
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:20,910
Mario found the third word to unlock WarioWare.

2286
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:21,810
Win!

2287
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,640
Alright, time to go back to the Pokémon Center.

2288
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,500
Let's go back to the Pokémon!

2289
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:35,360
Wow!

2290
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,220
Yes!

2291
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,860
I'm gonna win!

2292
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:42,800
Wow!

2293
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:49,180
When will I meet Waluigi?

2294
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,240
I just want to... I want to meet my hero, Waluigi.

2295
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,560
My Oshii.

2296
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,080
I just want to say I have really good taste in Oshii's.

2297
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,800
Okay, I don't remember where he lives.

2298
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,240
Waluigi Doko!

2299
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,260
Okay, that's Ashley's place.

2300
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,500
Where the fuck is the...

2301
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,120
warehouse?

2302
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,020
Okay, that's the center.

2303
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,020
Oh.

2304
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,240
Is it like down...

2305
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,620
Is that it?

2306
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,020
No.

2307
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,240
No, it's not here.

2308
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,440
Is it down here?

2309
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,720
That's the mall.

2310
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,580
This is...

2311
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,660
Where you're making more babies again.

2312
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,500
Okay, that's your third one.

2313
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,720
It's not here.

2314
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,680
The fuck is it?

2315
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,080
Oh my god.

2316
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,960
Where's the map?

2317
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:07,260
I don't... Oh, there it is.

2318
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:07,840
I found it.

2319
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:11,700
Mario...

2320
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,000
Mario...

2321
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,620
Gonna win!

2322
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:13,800
Mwah!

2323
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,040
Click.

2324
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,140
The door opened.

2325
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:20,470
Hmm.

2326
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:22,490
Here we are.

2327
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:23,430
Mwah ha ha!

2328
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:24,470
It's done!

2329
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:30,010
My hit new game that's gonna make me loads of money is complete!

2330
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,250
Now to sell it!

2331
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,150
Mario!

2332
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,230
What are you doing here?

2333
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:40,530
How'd you get into my studio?

2334
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,170
Wait.

2335
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,930
I just got one of my brilliant ideas.

2336
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:51,710
Creatures of Diamond City is I, Wario!

2337
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:56,730
Your most beloved and stinkiest gamer.

2338
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:59,550
Today I have a special surprise for you all.

2339
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:02,490
I'm releasing a new game for you all to buy!

2340
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,090
Wario Mon!

2341
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:09,650
It's so much better than that stinking Pydomon that you're all playing right now!

2342
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:15,330
And to prove it, I have Mario here to wallow and defeat against my Wario Mon!

2343
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:16,950
Mwah ha ha ha!

2344
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:22,250
Something strange seems to be going on with Wario's PC.

2345
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:24,790
Is that supposed to happen?

2346
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:26,950
I downloaded this off the internet.

2347
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:32,570
You wouldn't just download a game off the internet, right?

2348
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,990
What?

2349
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:40,570
Pokemon?

2350
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:41,430
What?

2351
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,150
What is he doing in my video game?

2352
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:48,690
Oh my god, Red?

2353
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:51,970
Oh my god, the crossover.

2354
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:55,510
You wouldn't just download Pokemon off the PC, would you?

2355
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:57,890
The Nintendo lawyers are looking right now.

2356
01:27:57,910 --> 01:28:00,030
Ha ha ha ha!

2357
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:04,510
Never fuck with the Nintendo lawyer!

2358
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:13,170
Oh my god, it's not fair!

2359
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,450
He had like...

2360
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:17,490
...50-plus years of trading!

2361
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,990
Quick, cover the screen!

2362
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,750
The Nintendo ninjas.

2363
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:32,850
Don't worry, I got a Vito throw.

2364
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,890
Oh my god, it's red!

2365
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:42,970
Oh my god, there's Lapras!

2366
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,190
Don't worry.

2367
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:47,690
Oh, I like how it's like the original sprite too.

2368
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:49,430
That's so cute.

2369
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,290
Don't worry, fire beats water, right?

2370
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:59,690
If we put enough fire, if there's enough fire, it'll eventually beat water.

2371
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:01,350
It'll overpower water.

2372
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:04,450
Yes.

2373
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,590
He's paralyzed, I'll take my 50.

2374
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:11,070
No, I should heal him.

2375
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:13,130
I was gonna say, I'll take my 50-50.

2376
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:14,530
He could get paralyzed next.

2377
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,870
Alright, let's get you some HP.

2378
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,030
Yeah!

2379
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:25,610
If there's enough fire, we can evaporate the water!

2380
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:26,990
Exactly!

2381
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:32,650
Okay.

2382
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:34,090
Yeah, but I wanna...

2383
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:36,070
I wanna, like, get enough...

2384
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,350
I wanna make sure I heal before the next Mon comes in.

2385
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:41,950
I wanna make sure I heal before the next Mon comes in.

2386
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,660
That's right, Dad.

2387
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:50,800
You're so good.

2388
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,280
He's like, please.

2389
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:02,280
He's like, oh, I love Arcanine's original spray...

2390
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:02,980
Or yellow spray.

2391
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,100
That's so cute.

2392
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,520
Until his last breath.

2393
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,240
Don't worry.

2394
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,480
Don't worry.

2395
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:14,080
Don't worry, Dad.

2396
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,360
I can fix you later.

2397
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,100
Oh my god, it's a secular.

2398
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,540
Oh, it's not very effective.

2399
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,160
Well, I was gonna use that for the other one anyway.

2400
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,560
Yay!

2401
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,460
There's Husky Goon mooching off of Dad.

2402
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,600
Uh...

2403
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,800
With sharp fans...

2404
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,200
Maybe low 80...

2405
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:45,880
Stun...

2406
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,240
Let's get rid of Vine Whip.

2407
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,200
Actually...

2408
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:50,980
Um...

2409
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:51,920
I'm gonna grass move.

2410
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:52,680
I'll get rid of Bite.

2411
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,380
Sorry, you can't be a little kinky anymore.

2412
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,500
Well, you can be ultra kinky with Crunch.

2413
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,840
That's harder than...

2414
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,860
But...

2415
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,680
Crunch is a better Bite.

2416
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,000
Alright, let's go...

2417
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:13,820
Storm through.

2418
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,160
Crunch is Bite, but cool.

2419
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,600
That's what the C stands for.

2420
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,020
C for cool.

2421
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,140
Yay!

2422
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,140
Level 29!

2423
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,600
Wow, Charge.

2424
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:32,840
What's that?

2425
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,200
An electrical tackle that also hurts the users?

2426
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,240
That's a gamble I'm willing to take.

2427
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:45,320
It's just like when he jumped off the bed.

2428
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,520
It's okay.

2429
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:48,120
I'm trying.

2430
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:49,680
It's okay, guys.

2431
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,080
I'm...

2432
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,740
I'm making a joke out of it.

2433
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,760
Because, like...

2434
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,180
I'm...

2435
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,540
This is my way of coping.

2436
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:56,720
That's...

2437
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,340
Stop!

2438
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,180
Wait!

2439
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:01,440
Wait!

2440
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,360
Too soon!

2441
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:05,980
Is that...

2442
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:09,740
Yay!

2443
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:10,960
I got 420!

2444
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:11,400
Nice!

2445
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,280
Wow!

2446
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,900
I put 1 day's effort into this game and I lost.

2447
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:25,660
I even cut corners on the mouth friends I used to make this.

2448
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,660
What gives?

2449
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,220
Mario booted up the PC, frankly, checking the game's files.

2450
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:32,280
Pokemon?

2451
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,960
What the heck is Pokemon?

2452
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,500
This is just a cheap knockoff of Pokemon!

2453
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,220
I can't believe it!

2454
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,080
I can't believe it!

2455
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:46,820
You got lucky, Mario!

2456
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,600
Pokemon wishes it could be as good as Pokemon!

2457
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:58,570
My game was supposed to defeat you, but I guess I just have to take care of you myself!

2458
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:01,950
If you decide to come over here, what's with that nook?

2459
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:07,410
I'm not gonna put that sort of effort in if I don't have to.

2460
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:08,610
Are you ready?

2461
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:09,550
Yeah, I am.

2462
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:10,330
Wahaha!

2463
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:12,490
Dad, you'll be okay.

2464
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,350
You don't need heroes.

2465
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,750
Oh, they gave me full HP!

2466
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:21,830
It's Wario time!

2467
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:23,170
Nice.

2468
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,850
Dad was like, please, heal me.

2469
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,910
I'm like, no, you're going straight in.

2470
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:35,630
Oh my god.

2471
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,610
You're already paralyzed?

2472
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:39,270
Ow!

2473
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,990
I have ramps!

2474
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:44,490
Uh-oh.

2475
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:49,620
Okay.

2476
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:51,060
Level two.

2477
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,140
Rantel?

2478
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:55,660
Oh my...

2479
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:55,880
Oh!

2480
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:57,120
This is ramp!

2481
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,640
Oh, I hated those.

2482
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,960
It's from...

2483
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,460
I forgot the game.

2484
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,360
Super Mario World?

2485
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:05,780
What was it called?

2486
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,960
That was one of my favorite games as a child.

2487
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,240
Yeah, the key guys!

2488
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:09,620
Yes!

2489
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,420
Mario 2?

2490
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,220
Oh, wait, no!

2491
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:11,780
Not Super...

2492
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:13,480
The key guys!

2493
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:14,300
Yeah, Mario 2!

2494
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,940
It's one of my favorite...

2495
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,440
It was so...

2496
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,140
It was really hard.

2497
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:17,820
I hated them.

2498
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,440
The key guys, I hated...

2499
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,960
I hated them so much.

2500
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,500
It's okay.

2501
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:25,780
You're already paralyzed so I can use that move.

2502
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,540
Oh, wait.

2503
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,500
I forgot I hurt itself.

2504
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:29,000
Never mind.

2505
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,420
I forgot that I hurt myself instead of paralyzing me.

2506
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,100
Uh, nope.

2507
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,300
Fuzzy B.

2508
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,040
I'll just use Flame Wheel.

2509
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:41,720
Flame Wheel!

2510
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,280
Uh, Brady, thank you for the Super Chat.

2511
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,200
Thank you, thank you.

2512
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,140
Just got back from my sister's college graduation.

2513
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:50,560
Whoa!

2514
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:51,720
Thank you for the Super Chat.

2515
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:52,360
Thank you, thank you.

2516
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:53,460
You had a great time.

2517
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,200
Congratulations on your sister.

2518
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:56,180
Graduating.

2519
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:07,840
I remember playing, uh, Mario 2 for so long and I never completed it because it was so hard for me.

2520
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,440
I was a stupid kid.

2521
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,320
Um, headbutt, that's metal.

2522
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,420
Might as well get out or tackle.

2523
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:20,640
Poof!

2524
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,800
Forgot tackle and learn headbutt.

2525
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,280
No, you're still going in.

2526
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,240
You're gonna...

2527
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,560
Wait, what was Pyro...

2528
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:33,760
Pyro...

2529
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:33,800
Pyro...

2530
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,740
Oh, it doesn't even matter.

2531
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,500
Doesn't even matter.

2532
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,400
You'll win anyway.

2533
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,100
I'm gonna punch your bird!

2534
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,580
Oh my god, I got so aggressive.

2535
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:45,000
I just chomped down my cough drop instantly.

2536
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,300
I said that and I chomped it down.

2537
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,120
I was like, gonna punch you.

2538
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,760
I was like, gonna punch you.

2539
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,360
I like, chomped my cough drop in half.

2540
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,420
Or don't die.

2541
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:05,900
Wait.

2542
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:06,820
Oh my god.

2543
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,380
I was gonna be like, wait a minute.

2544
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,880
I could have lost that.

2545
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,840
There can only be one bird here.

2546
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,220
I'll get rid of the competition.

2547
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:17,380
I'll get rid of the competition.

2548
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:23,450
What?

2549
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:27,890
What?

2550
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,010
What can I win?

2551
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:35,490
The Diamond City Power Star has fallen out of Wario's pocket.

2552
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,810
And into Mario's hands.

2553
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:46,050
Mario received the Diamond City Power Star.

2554
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:49,070
I mean, uh...

2555
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:51,410
Looks like the camera feed is breaking up.

2556
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:52,810
Heh heh.

2557
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:53,990
Now's my chance.

2558
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:57,510
Request to Wire Inc.

2559
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,470
is now complete.

2560
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,170
Yeah!

2561
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:00,310
I did it!

2562
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:02,310
Okay, I need to...

2563
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:03,630
go back to the Pokemon Center.

2564
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,230
No, what?

2565
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:08,970
Never mind.

2566
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,090
Did I talk about this?

2567
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:13,070
So, you know how they're like...

2568
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:13,950
You'll never...

2569
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:15,410
You won't download a car.

2570
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:17,410
You know that famous quote?

2571
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:18,590
A person...

2572
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:20,730
Apparently, the person who made that ad...

2573
01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:23,970
illegally downloaded the font for that ad.

2574
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:25,750
I thought that was so fucking funny.

2575
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:31,330
You won't illegally download the...

2576
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:32,130
People were like...

2577
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,550
You wouldn't illegally download a font, would you?

2578
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:37,390
Yeah, he stole the font...

2579
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,410
To make...

2580
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:40,930
He stole the font and the music...

2581
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:43,690
to make the video ad.

2582
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,450
Isn't that fucking crazy?

2583
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:45,550
Really?

2584
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:50,250
Yeah, I saw that, and then someone made a parody of it.

2585
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,110
It's so ironic.

2586
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,710
I guess I go to the next world.

2587
01:37:58,030 --> 01:37:59,690
I don't think there's anything else for me to explore.

2588
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:01,510
I go home now.

2589
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:05,590
Wait, where's home?

2590
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:09,630
Was it Toad Town?

2591
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:11,090
Yay!

2592
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:16,670
We leave now.

2593
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:19,370
Mario!

2594
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:21,410
Sorry, that's my Luigi voice.

2595
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:22,170
Mario!

2596
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:22,990
Wait, okay.

2597
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:25,410
I can't do the Toad voice, so...

2598
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:26,290
Uh, Pom, thank you for the Super Chat.

2599
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:27,190
Thank you, thank you.

2600
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:29,530
Um...

2601
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:31,850
Boy, am I glad to see you.

2602
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:33,990
I'm just about finished up here.

2603
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:37,050
You should be able to go to World 4 in just a moment.

2604
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:39,630
Wait just a minute!

2605
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,730
I'm Kamek.

2606
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,370
Can't allow you to do that.

2607
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:49,510
Lord Bowser attacked me with ensuring you don't repair this warp pipe.

2608
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:52,030
And I won't let his furliness down.

2609
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:54,950
The entire road toad.

2610
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:00,570
Oh, wait.

2611
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:04,290
Wait, did he send himself in?

2612
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:05,990
Wait a minute.

2613
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:08,630
But you were just there.

2614
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:13,590
Wait.

2615
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,070
You were just there.

2616
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:15,710
Hold up.

2617
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:17,510
This doesn't make sense.

2618
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:20,850
Admin abuse.

2619
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:22,450
How do you do a...

2620
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:24,050
You're the full 23!

2621
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:27,910
Wait a minute.

2622
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:30,170
This is a bit not fair.

2623
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:31,950
Wait a minute.

2624
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:33,050
Wait.

2625
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,410
Wait a minute.

2626
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,710
None of this is a little fair, guys.

2627
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:37,490
No.

2628
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:43,370
Oh, no.

2629
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,790
Oh, no.

2630
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:45,990
I have zero heals.

2631
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:50,530
Oh, that's bad.

2632
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:53,070
All right, guys.

2633
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:55,810
I think dad might not survive.

2634
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,390
Double crit hit?

2635
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:00,630
What is this?

2636
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,220
Dragoon?

2637
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,100
Will we be okay?

2638
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:13,640
Okay.

2639
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:14,420
Body slam.

2640
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,860
Guys, I don't have a full restore.

2641
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,060
Oh, nice.

2642
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,340
Dragoon, you got this.

2643
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,340
Dude is for dead.

2644
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,080
But Dragoon only lick.

2645
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:33,600
How fight when Dragoon wants to lick?

2646
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:34,940
Peace and love.

2647
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,540
You not...

2648
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:37,700
Oh, wait.

2649
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:38,560
Lick?

2650
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:39,580
Oh, wait.

2651
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:39,940
Headbutt.

2652
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:40,660
All right, guys.

2653
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:42,100
I'm sorry.

2654
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,140
You won't be allowed to swallow anymore.

2655
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,140
It's time.

2656
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,440
I'm sorry, Dragoon.

2657
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,600
You won't be able to swallow.

2658
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,980
What a relief.

2659
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:05,660
Lord Bowser.

2660
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,900
What's the point?

2661
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,420
No, Donkey.

2662
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:13,560
I'm going to get dumped now.

2663
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,600
It's all I have.

2664
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,640
No way.

2665
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,080
Lord Bowser is going to kill me.

2666
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,440
Don't think this is over, Mario.

2667
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,500
I'll let you go this time.

2668
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:35,740
As I'm going to think up an excuse to tell Lord Bowser so I don't get into trouble.

2669
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,000
Oh, that was weird.

2670
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,100
Let me just...

2671
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:41,860
Let me just get this warp pipe all fixed up then.

2672
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,140
There you go, Mario.

2673
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,060
That warp pipe should be all fixed up.

2674
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:48,660
Good luck out there.

2675
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:50,200
All right.

2676
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:51,400
Bye.

2677
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:52,740
Toad.

2678
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:54,740
I gotta fix that.

2679
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,900
I love that.

2680
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,060
I love that song.

2681
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,180
I think you were waiting.

2682
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,960
All right.

2683
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:24,640
World 4.

2684
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:25,740
And then we have...

2685
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,220
Four more worlds after World 4.

2686
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:32,660
See if we can get close to beating World 4 today.

2687
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,620
Oh, it's...

2688
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,540
Wait, what is this?

2689
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,820
What world would this one be?

2690
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,380
Do you know this entire area used to be a marsh?

2691
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:48,280
I wonder what city this is going to be based off of.

2692
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:52,000
I feel like I'm thinking about five gifted ships.

2693
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,120
Thank you, thank you.

2694
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:56,400
All right.

2695
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,240
Oh my God, it's these guys.

2696
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:00,640
Breaks.

2697
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:03,520
Scuttlebug.

2698
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,640
Have you heard about the scuttlebug?

2699
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:08,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2700
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,800
You know, the scuttlebug.

2701
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:11,620
Whoa, whoa.

2702
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2703
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,240
He's got special eyes.

2704
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,160
Oh, no, not the flinch.

2705
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,020
Cease now.

2706
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2707
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,560
No, tell me more.

2708
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,180
Hey, wake up, wake up.

2709
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,180
Have you heard about the scuttlebutt?

2710
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2711
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,900
One of my favorite songs.

2712
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:45,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2713
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,420
Oh my God, kill it.

2714
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:51,260
What the fuck is that?

2715
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,560
What game?

2716
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,300
Where are you from?

2717
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,300
And why would they do this to you?

2718
01:43:58,940 --> 01:43:59,500
What?

2719
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,760
Oh my God.

2720
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,960
I can't.

2721
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:06,820
It's raining.

2722
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:10,900
I, if I could, I'd burn it with fire.

2723
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,360
But it's raining.

2724
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,950
Burn it in holy fire.

2725
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:28,270
It looks like some fucking Dark Souls enemy right here.

2726
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:33,230
I use electricity.

2727
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:36,290
It's alright.

2728
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:37,230
We'll do one more flame.

2729
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:41,700
Bye-bye.

2730
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:48,320
Oh, I keep forgetting to get Yuri into the party.

2731
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,500
Wait, I got zero dollars?

2732
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:50,900
Give me my money.

2733
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:53,320
Here's your prize money.

2734
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,840
But hey, wait a minute.

2735
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:56,540
You don't have a coin case.

2736
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:00,300
Here on Main Street, everyone uses purple coins.

2737
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:02,520
Here, let me get you situated.

2738
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,180
Wait, if I like randomly battle poor people, can I just like take their entire life?

2739
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,400
Are they like legally required to pay me?

2740
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,820
And here's your purple coins.

2741
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:16,540
Like, if like, you know...

2742
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,000
Like, don't just rob the homeless.

2743
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:33,160
I'm just winning the laws in this, like, you know, Pokemon battle.

2744
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,800
You know, but like, you know, poor...

2745
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,900
Like, you know, someone who's poor might be like trying to do Pokemon battles to like make money.

2746
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:45,080
You know, because they're like, you know, they're like, this is how I'm going to try to get income.

2747
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:49,280
And they try to challenge me, not knowing that I have stronger Pokemons.

2748
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:54,400
And so, like, if I win against them, are they like forced to pay me?

2749
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,260
Like, what are the laws?

2750
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,560
Like, am I...

2751
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,420
Dude, are they like in debt to me?

2752
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,240
Do they in debt to me?

2753
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:10,260
Those are all anyone cares about around here.

2754
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,940
Suspend them wisely.

2755
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:13,980
Shoot.

2756
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,440
Literally hustling.

2757
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,720
I'm just wondering, like, how do you enforce the give money shit?

2758
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,580
Like, how do they enforce it?

2759
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,040
Hey, what gives?

2760
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,640
I'm about to catch something big.

2761
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:38,050
Oh my god!

2762
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:41,210
I need this.

2763
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:45,490
This is what I need in my exile box.

2764
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:52,930
Oh, and it gives sweet kisses.

2765
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:56,190
That's definitely what I need.

2766
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:03,610
I'm setting up something special in my PC.

2767
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:07,070
In my PC box right now.

2768
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:12,030
We need it in the box.

2769
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:16,350
We gotta make sure everyone's happy.

2770
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:26,940
Bro, what is happening in that box?

2771
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:27,520
Sorry.

2772
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,780
To enter the box, you gotta sign an NDA.

2773
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,100
If you wanna...

2774
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,280
If you wanna...

2775
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:41,480
Those who enter the exile chamber must sign an NDA so nothing gets out.

2776
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,620
Fish bones.

2777
01:47:54,970 --> 01:47:55,850
Oh, it's...

2778
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:56,890
I don't need that guy.

2779
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:06,580
Dad, please!

2780
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:08,580
Oh, wait.

2781
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,460
I'm gonna hurt myself, too.

2782
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:09,800
Oops.

2783
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,380
You can't...

2784
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,060
Dad, please!

2785
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,020
You can't faint yet!

2786
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,920
I need you to hurt yourself a little bit.

2787
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:19,500
I forgot about that.

2788
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,640
When I sign an NDA, when you said me.

2789
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:27,720
Name that mon after me.

2790
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:29,140
That's when you...

2791
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:29,920
It's like...

2792
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,800
You know, I was like...

2793
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,940
Remember to accept the terms and conditions?

2794
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:35,220
That's my terms and conditions.

2795
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:41,800
The moment an NDA was inserted in that terms of conditions.

2796
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,000
And you didn't bother reading.

2797
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,700
And you just scrolled all the way down and said yes.

2798
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,620
You asked to be named...

2799
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:56,500
To be named.

2800
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:00,020
Boy, you fools.

2801
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:01,620
You fools.

2802
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:06,940
My contract is like a Disney contract.

2803
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,640
You guys hear about that shit?

2804
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:12,800
We're like...

2805
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:24,360
If Disney accidentally kills you, they are legally freed from any death-related causes that Disney caused.

2806
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:32,840
Because if you click yes on the terms and conditions of Disney+, and you die in Disneyland...

2807
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,760
Disney is like legally freed from any like...

2808
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:39,900
From...

2809
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,520
From like being...

2810
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,480
What's the word called?

2811
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:43,520
Yeah, no.

2812
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:44,020
Okay.

2813
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:44,800
Like it's...

2814
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,380
It actually happened in real life.

2815
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,000
Like...

2816
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:50,960
Yeah.

2817
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,100
Like...

2818
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,180
I don't know if they lost the case.

2819
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:55,300
Or...

2820
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:55,520
Oh yeah.

2821
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,620
Like they're not liable.

2822
01:49:56,780 --> 01:50:00,880
They're not liable for anything that might have caused your death.

2823
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,000
Like...

2824
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,440
That was like...

2825
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,000
That was their argument.

2826
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,020
Like...

2827
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:09,340
I don't know if they lost or won that.

2828
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:10,240
Like...

2829
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:14,000
I know they got a lot of lawyers to try and get out of it.

2830
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,120
Oh, thank God they lost the case.

2831
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,420
But that's wild.

2832
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,460
My contract's like that.

2833
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,260
But it...

2834
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:26,380
But like we learned from the Disney case to like make it stronger.

2835
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,400
Yeah.

2836
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:31,260
So like basically what happened...

2837
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,000
Was I was really sad.

2838
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:33,880
Like...

2839
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:34,320
Um...

2840
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,300
A woman...

2841
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:36,040
Like...

2842
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,380
Had like an allergic reaction at Disneyland.

2843
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:39,340
Um...

2844
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:40,540
From eating like...

2845
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,020
Um...

2846
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,080
From eating something there.

2847
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,580
And like she told him like...

2848
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,780
Oh, does this have like...

2849
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:46,120
I think it was like nuts or something.

2850
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,860
Does this thing have nuts?

2851
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:48,320
And the...

2852
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,200
The guy was...

2853
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,480
The restaurant owner was like...

2854
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:50,640
No.

2855
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:51,320
At Disneyland.

2856
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:53,300
And she had an allergic reaction and passed away.

2857
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:54,560
And then like...

2858
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,140
This...

2859
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:57,420
So then obviously the husband sued...

2860
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:58,560
Disneyland...

2861
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,580
Disney for that.

2862
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,500
Because like...

2863
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,600
That's fucking crazy.

2864
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:03,800
Um...

2865
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:04,660
That that happened.

2866
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,020
And then...

2867
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,100
Um...

2868
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:08,080
And then...

2869
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:08,420
Uh...

2870
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,620
Disney was like...

2871
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:10,100
Well...

2872
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:12,800
She signed up for Disney Plus for a free trial.

2873
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,980
And in our terms and conditions...

2874
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:16,480
On Disney Plus...

2875
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,760
We are not liable for whatever the fuck happens to you...

2876
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,580
At any Disney location.

2877
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:25,000
And that was their main argument.

2878
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,140
They signed up for a free...

2879
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:28,760
Trial.

2880
01:51:37,770 --> 01:51:38,450
Like...

2881
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:39,530
But anyway...

2882
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:40,390
That's my contract.

2883
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:44,470
But we learned from the Disney case.

2884
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:46,570
And we won't fail our trial.

2885
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:49,390
So...

2886
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:52,490
So you can't say nothing from...

2887
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:54,190
You can't tell anyone...

2888
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:56,850
What's going on in the Exile box.

2889
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:02,330
I guess I got a way.

2890
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:04,510
Take your purple coins...

2891
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:05,770
And let me try again.

2892
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:07,130
Okay.

2893
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:08,230
I need to...

2894
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:09,230
Figure out where...

2895
01:52:09,230 --> 01:52:10,350
If there's a place to heal.

2896
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:11,630
Oh my.

2897
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:13,650
You may seem like you need some rest.

2898
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:18,430
I'm pretty sure they fixed Disney Plus...

2899
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:19,970
Terms and conditions after that.

2900
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:24,750
The moment you get into my ball...

2901
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,130
My Mario ball...

2902
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:28,310
You've said yes to my contract.

2903
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:31,350
This entire area was only developed recently.

2904
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:31,690
You know?

2905
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:34,790
It used to be and still somewhat is on marsh because of this.

2906
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:37,350
You can get some good fish in the nearby river.

2907
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:41,670
Although you need this good rod in order to find them.

2908
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:44,410
So here you go.

2909
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:45,270
Don't be shy.

2910
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:47,710
Yeah, no.

2911
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:48,370
Fix it Disney.

2912
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:49,350
100%.

2913
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:50,510
They're gonna...

2914
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,290
Of course it's gonna be fixed in Disney's favor.

2915
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,650
They're gonna learn from the trial they lost...

2916
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:56,150
To make it even more fucked up.

2917
01:52:57,010 --> 01:52:57,970
Yo, try it out.

2918
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:03,530
Alright, fight me.

2919
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:07,190
It's Disney.

2920
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:15,130
Stopping around in these puddles sure is fun.

2921
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:27,150
Oh my god, he's so happy.

2922
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:28,550
Happy moon.

2923
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:35,370
Oh my god,

2924
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:40,730
he's so happy.

2925
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:45,690
Happy moon.

2926
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,050
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

2927
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:49,050
Thank you, thank you.

2928
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:55,270
This line, Evil Incorporated has the same number of syllables as Doofenshmirtz, Evil Incorporated.

2929
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:56,110
Coincidence?

2930
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,310
I think not.

2931
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:58,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2932
01:53:58,590 --> 01:53:59,430
Thank you, thank you.

2933
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:01,210
He's just a happy little guy.

2934
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:04,450
Not all happy little guys are freaky, alright?

2935
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:09,410
Sometimes they just... sometimes they might look freaky, but they're not.

2936
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:11,230
They were just put in that way.

2937
01:54:14,010 --> 01:54:18,650
It's the ones you don't think look freaky that you gotta look out for.

2938
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:23,690
The freakiest ones are the ones that look the most innocent.

2939
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:29,930
Because they have something to hide.

2940
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:34,570
They're like, inside, they're like, oh man, I'm too freaky.

2941
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:36,810
I need to make sure no one knows.

2942
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:40,470
They're always hiding something.

2943
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:41,730
I don't trust them.

2944
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,910
Always the ones you don't expect.

2945
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:53,090
Huh?

2946
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:54,450
Your prize?

2947
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:56,630
Oh, here you go, mister.

2948
01:54:57,570 --> 01:55:00,830
I don't really care about purple coins or what these are anyway.

2949
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,370
Alright.

2950
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:08,690
Oh my god.

2951
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:09,870
Oh my god!

2952
01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:10,310
Oh my god!

2953
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:12,450
It's like those... it's like the Perez.

2954
01:55:14,610 --> 01:55:15,910
The Shouplet!

2955
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:17,030
Alright.

2956
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:19,190
Time for you to lick it!

2957
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:20,730
It's licking time!

2958
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:23,090
Why is my egg not hatched yet?

2959
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:26,630
Your baby takes so long to hatch!

2960
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:30,030
Erpa!

2961
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:31,330
Why is erpa?

2962
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:32,950
Oh no, it poisoned me.

2963
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:34,710
Oh, it poisoned you.

2964
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:38,930
Alright.

2965
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:39,630
Licking time!

2966
01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:42,670
That's not gonna stop me from licking it!

2967
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:47,810
You're gonna lick that purple mushrooms!

2968
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:49,890
No matter what!

2969
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:52,590
Doki said lick it!

2970
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:55,530
It's your food for today!

2971
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:00,050
Alright.

2972
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:01,930
Green continues to fly!

2973
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,640
Alright.

2974
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:10,760
Time to catch it!

2975
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:12,940
Alright.

2976
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,420
Who wants to be the freaky mushroom?

2977
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,980
In the exile chamber?

2978
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,160
Yay!

2979
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:20,320
Oh my god!

2980
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:21,200
It's so weak!

2981
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,280
A small baby purple Goomba!

2982
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,200
Like alien!

2983
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:30,520
It takes refuge near small villages.

2984
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:33,400
It attacks by twirling which is often confused.

2985
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:33,980
No!

2986
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:35,040
Hahaha!

2987
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:37,000
Hahaha!

2988
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:37,220
Hahaha!

2989
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:39,700
Hahaha!

2990
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:41,380
Who wants to go in the chain...

2991
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,700
The exile room?

2992
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,820
Dragoons!

2993
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:45,580
Hahaha!

2994
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:47,940
Hahaha!

2995
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,460
Things happen there!

2996
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:50,140
Hahaha!

2997
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:50,800
Hahaha!

2998
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:50,960
Hahaha!

2999
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:54,040
Alright.

3000
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:55,820
Co...

3001
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:57,280
I just got...

3002
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,800
Saw the first person that...

3003
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,080
Uh...

3004
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:00,980
That's uh...

3005
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:02,180
Cosmic...

3006
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,280
Goon...

3007
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,060
Would that fit?

3008
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:07,740
C...

3009
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:08,060
G...

3010
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:08,260
O...

3011
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:08,980
It just fits.

3012
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:09,280
Okay.

3013
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:10,380
G...

3014
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:12,680
O...

3015
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,100
O...

3016
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:13,860
N...

3017
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:14,060
Area.

3018
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:17,760
I was gonna say...

3019
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:18,920
Uh...

3020
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,160
I see you spamming.

3021
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:20,940
Maybe I...

3022
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:21,000
No!

3023
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:21,640
I'm joking.

3024
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:22,740
I'm not that fucked up.

3025
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:23,380
I...

3026
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:26,060
It's like...

3027
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:26,460
Wait.

3028
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,380
You said me several times.

3029
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,500
Let me remove that real quick.

3030
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:31,380
Let me...

3031
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:31,860
Hahahaha!

3032
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,000
Hahahaha!

3033
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:36,060
Hahahaha!

3034
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:39,880
Hahahaha!

3035
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,880
He was just really excited.

3036
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:49,990
Alright.

3037
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:50,450
Yay!

3038
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:51,970
I'm much better now.

3039
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:53,070
I'm okay now.

3040
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:53,970
I took that lady's...

3041
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:56,610
Um...

3042
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:56,850
Oh wait.

3043
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:57,430
What is that?

3044
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:58,170
Jabba?

3045
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:03,170
I took that lady's home remedy care.

3046
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:04,170
She said don't...

3047
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:04,990
She said...

3048
01:58:04,990 --> 01:58:05,550
I should...

3049
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:07,050
I wouldn't need to go to the doctors.

3050
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:08,010
They're fake news.

3051
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:11,510
Just use those...

3052
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:12,330
Old...

3053
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:12,930
Old...

3054
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:14,110
Old herbal remedies.

3055
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:17,530
A fly with a nose.

3056
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:19,570
It's like a little peanut.

3057
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,410
Alright.

3058
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:24,950
Lick it!

3059
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:26,810
Hahahaha!

3060
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,510
That's right!

3061
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:31,230
Lick everything!

3062
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:34,250
It's ours now.

3063
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:38,110
Keep licking dragon!

3064
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:39,430
Yeah!

3065
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:40,570
Hahaha!

3066
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:42,390
Hahaha!

3067
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:45,490
Keep licking it!

3068
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,850
And I will watch!

3069
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:48,890
Hahahaha!

3070
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:57,190
Lucky please!

3071
01:58:59,090 --> 01:58:59,690
Hahaha!

3072
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:03,570
Yay!

3073
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,010
Jabba was caught!

3074
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:08,810
We are all watching.

3075
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:12,990
A tiny mosquito-like creature.

3076
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:15,590
In its youth, it is prone to cowardice.

3077
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:20,810
It takes lodge inside the trunks of great trees and is rumored to hide in bushes.

3078
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:22,690
Alright, who wants to be a little Jabba?

3079
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:24,530
That the Yoshi licked?

3080
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:32,690
Alright, let's see.

3081
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,190
Let's see.

3082
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:45,330
I want to sign the NDA.

3083
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:54,030
Oh, you think just because I read it, you're definitely gonna be picked?

3084
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:55,710
No, no, no.

3085
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:56,650
We got it.

3086
01:59:58,090 --> 01:59:58,650
Psyche!

3087
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:02,830
Made you feel a little happiness today.

3088
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:03,830
I...

3089
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:04,350
I...

3090
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:08,050
I...

3091
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:08,790
Okay, here you go.

3092
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:10,530
Um...

3093
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:11,710
I...

3094
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,950
I...

3095
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:17,210
I...

3096
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:21,570
I...

3097
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:28,810
I had to name that person.

3098
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:36,500
Oh my god, it's him.

3099
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,000
Oh my god, fuck this guy.

3100
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,100
This guy is so ugly.

3101
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:42,360
I don't know.

3102
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:42,920
It's just...

3103
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:43,440
It's so...

3104
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,600
Oh, I know what it reminds me of.

3105
02:00:56,530 --> 02:00:59,230
Oh my god.

3106
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:09,190
Oh my god, why do I keep bumping at him?

3107
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:11,830
I don't want that.

3108
02:01:14,090 --> 02:01:14,770
What?

3109
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:15,810
Get out!

3110
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,030
Get out!

3111
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:24,510
The fact that it stares back at you two.

3112
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:25,650
Oh, there's Spike!

3113
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:27,950
We don't have Spike?

3114
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:30,110
Oh, I think it's because I keep fighting spikes.

3115
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:32,890
But I've never, like, actually captured one.

3116
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:34,150
It's time to lick it.

3117
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:37,890
Face your fears.

3118
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:41,930
Yes!

3119
02:01:42,250 --> 02:01:43,890
Lick it, Dragoon!

3120
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:45,130
Keep licking it!

3121
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:47,370
We lick everything.

3122
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:50,970
Wait, it doesn't affect him?

3123
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:52,070
Oh, he doesn't like it.

3124
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:54,810
He's like...

3125
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:55,870
Oh, no!

3126
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:56,990
What?

3127
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:58,830
What do you mean you don't like it?

3128
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:00,670
I don't understand!

3129
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:05,570
Why don't you like it?

3130
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:11,250
Oh, thank God he's normal.

3131
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:18,640
All right.

3132
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,580
Let's do... Okay, which one?

3133
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,160
Ah!

3134
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:23,720
I feel like if I use these, he's gonna...

3135
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,420
He's gonna, like, die.

3136
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:26,540
So I should just...

3137
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:29,240
I'll just use the bite to slowly whittle it down.

3138
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:30,560
Boo!

3139
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:32,420
Normie!

3140
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:33,020
Boo!

3141
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:43,200
All right, I guess you can rest your tongue for a little bit, Dragoon.

3142
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,120
It's time to bite instead!

3143
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:50,220
Just as freaky!

3144
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:50,440
Yeah!

3145
02:02:53,180 --> 02:02:53,680
All right.

3146
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:54,840
Pokeball time!

3147
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:57,000
Lumber cat!

3148
02:02:58,540 --> 02:02:59,660
Chicken jocking!

3149
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:04,120
Lava!

3150
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:05,800
Ch-ch-ch-chicken!

3151
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,740
If I ever gonna do another concert, I wanna sing that song.

3152
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:10,660
That's my next Five Nights at...

3153
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:11,420
That's my...

3154
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:13,240

3159
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,800
A hard-working yet oblivious turtle.

3160
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:27,760
It throws heavy spiked projectiles at perceived threats.

3161
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:30,480
Its stomach is said to contain unlimited ammunition.

3162
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:33,560
Oh yeah, for those who...

3163
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,800
Oh yeah, that reminded me!

3164
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:36,200

02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:36,680
Uh...

3166
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:38,920
For those who are wondering, um...

3167
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,080
When we're uploading the songs.

3168
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,840
Min and I actually, like, asked about it recently.

3169
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,620
A week or two ago.

3170
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,620
And they said, uh...

3171
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,860
Like, some stuff happened.

3172
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:51,380
They're like, oh, sorry for the poor communication and stuff.

3173
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:53,060
But they'll get us the...

3174
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:54,920
They'll try to get us the videos as soon...

3175
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:55,240
Like...

3176
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,320
Either this month or next month.

3177
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:59,300
So I hope we can upload it soon.

3178
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:00,460

I mean, you guys have been waiting for a very long time for them.

3181
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:04,640

3182
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:06,260
So...

3183
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:09,560
I hope we can upload the individual performances soon for you guys.

3184
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,100
Alright, who wants to be Spike?

3185
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,040
He's like a...

3186
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,400
He's like a crowd favorite.

3187
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:17,680
I've seen him around a lot.

3188
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:21,380
Yeah, cause I know like some of you guys have been waiting for a long time.

3189
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:23,780
For like the HD quality version of it.

3190
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,240
Instead of like, you know, the camera rip.

3191
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:31,880
Spike is a chill guy.

3192
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:32,500
Yeah.

3193
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,160
Yeah, he is.

3194
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:36,260
Well, actually you need to use the bathroom.

Pick me and my life is yours, Doki.

3216
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:57,970

3224
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:07,230
No, but Meep won.

3225
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:07,910
Oh, wait.

3226
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:08,910
Were you guys voting?

3227
02:09:09,410 --> 02:09:09,790
All right.

3228
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:11,970
Whichever one has the most...

3229
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:16,230
Whichever super chat has the most votes becomes Spike.

3230
02:09:22,670 --> 02:09:24,410
It's... It's American Idol.

3231
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:25,090
Wait, what is it?

3232
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:26,930
American Idol, everyone.

3233
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:30,130

02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:33,550
And then that will be your next Dokimon.

3235
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:40,730
Meep already won.

02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:47,290
It's like, grab your phones and text your vote on this number right now.

3237

Dragun against Dragun.

3238
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:01,770
The game was rigged from the start.

3239
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:03,190
All right.

3240
02:10:03,870 --> 02:10:04,650
I guess...

3241
02:10:04,650 --> 02:10:06,370

3242
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:08,390

02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:18,050
There he is.

3246
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:21,250
Wait, did Meep already have...

3247
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:23,050
No, Meep didn't already have a mod, did he?

3248
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:24,690
I don't think so, right?

3249
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:28,710
Silent!

3250
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:30,330
Welcome to the tomato farm!

3251
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:31,390
Welcome, welcome!

3252
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:34,430
Did he...

3253
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:36,790
Wait, don't get...

3254
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:39,050
Don't get one, guys!

3255
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:42,030
Gladstone just wants him...

3256
02:10:42,030 --> 02:10:44,330
Gladstone's trying to sabotage it.

3257
02:10:46,770 --> 02:10:47,570
Gladstone...

3258
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:49,470
What if Gladstone actually...

3259
02:10:49,470 --> 02:10:50,230
Uh...

3260
02:10:50,230 --> 02:10:51,950
Actually knows...

3261
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:52,670
It's...

3262
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:52,970
Like...

3263
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:53,770
Was lying...

3264
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:55,890
And he's like, I'm gonna sabotage this.

3265
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:56,330
Right?

3266
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:59,130
Okay.

3267
02:11:00,090 --> 02:11:00,750
Meep...

3268
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:02,410
Uh...

3269
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:04,130
The long con...

3270
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:06,150
Not Meep did have one.

3271
02:11:07,390 --> 02:11:08,110
All right.

3272
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:08,950
We'll see here.

3273
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:10,930
We'll see if Meep has one.

3274
02:11:11,290 --> 02:11:12,510
We can change it, right?

3275
02:11:12,510 --> 02:11:12,710
All right.

3276
02:11:12,810 --> 02:11:13,490
Exile time.

3277
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:15,830
Don't let him deter us.

3278
02:11:17,150 --> 02:11:17,830
All right.

3279
02:11:17,850 --> 02:11:18,510
We'll see.

3280
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:19,550
We're going back.

3281
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,100
All right.

3282
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:24,740
We'll see.

3283
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:27,140
Demonic!

3284
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:28,260
Thank you for the super chat.

3285
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:28,640
Thank you.

3286
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:29,380
Thank you.

3287
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:30,820
I'll never lose my...

3288
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:33,020
My virginity because I never lose.

3289
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:33,840
Meep probably.

3290
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,380
Thank you for the super chat.

3291
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:35,900
Thank you.

3292
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:36,680
Thank you.

3293
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:38,760
All right.

3294
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:39,300
Let's see.

3295
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:40,980
Let's check...

3296
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:43,600
Let's check the exile chamber and see if they're having fun.

3297
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:44,560
All right.

3298
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:46,300
Alex, Gus...

3299
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:55,200
The Dragon, Hank, Cat, NextE, FOP, P, Tips, Smurf, Minion...

3300
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:55,520
Oh, yeah.

3301
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:56,120
This is...

3302
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:56,860
I forgot.

3303
02:11:56,860 --> 02:11:57,640
We sold one.

3304
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:00,880
Goodbye.

3305
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:04,040
We traded one of them for this guy.

3306
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:05,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

3307
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,440
Oh, he was!

3308
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:13,540
He was trying to sabotage it!

3309
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:17,660
He's like, he's like spreading the word.

3310
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:22,240
Meep, I should... Oh wait, I didn't want to... Sorry, Meep, you're going into the exile chamber.

3311
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:27,460
I want to... I want to hear you, but like, I'm still trying to hash this fucking egg.

3312
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:30,200
Saboteur!

3313
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:34,100
I take the... I thank Steve for having this vote.

3314
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,640
Thank you for the super chat, Meep.

3315
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:36,860
Thank you, thank you.

3316
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:43,140
Hey... How long does it take to hatch these?

3317
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:48,320
Yeah, but I want to name the baby.

3318
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,540
It will take some time.

3319
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:58,760
It still doesn't tell me how... What?

3320
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:00,000
It's so long!

3321
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,480
I looked at the summary and it still says it might take some time.

3322
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,680
I've been running around for so long.

3323
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3324
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:13,540
I should buy more balls.

3325
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:20,440
Oh, I only have like the regular ones.

3326
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:22,000
I want like the stronger ones.

3327
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,720
Oh, it's because I'm in the first town.

3328
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:25,220
That's right.

3329
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:26,940
I'll go buy in the next town then.

3330
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:34,000
All right, let's go back to world four.

3331
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,080
Yeah, but they don't have a Yoshi.

3332
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:39,280
I don't have a Yoshi yet.

3333
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:41,100
You have to like buy a Whistler or something.

3334
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:44,460
I don't know if I caught all the mimes in this area, but let's see.

3335
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:46,440
I still need to start fishing too.

3336
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:50,500
I'll do like two more encounters here and see if we get there's any more.

3337
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:59,130
We ever want to play Pokefusion?

3338
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:00,130
What's Pokefusion?

3339
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:02,650
Is that like one of the other ROM hacks?

3340
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,280
Oh, I had a Whistle for free in the Toe Town?

3341
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:15,980
Wait, really?

3342
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:19,960
Which one?

3343
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:27,010
The only reason why I don't...

3344
02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:29,730
The thing is, you don't see me play Pokemon games?

3345
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:35,670
It's because I personally, I don't like one of the Toads.

3346
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:36,830
But there's so many.

3347
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:39,790
Oh, wait.

3348
02:14:40,130 --> 02:14:42,190
The thing is, I don't know if I talked to him before.

3349
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:42,610
Sorry.

3350
02:14:42,890 --> 02:14:44,130
He's not that interesting.

3351
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:46,810
Sorry, Toad.

3352
02:14:46,810 --> 02:14:47,770
I know you're...

3353
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:48,750
Oh, my God.

3354
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:49,030
Wow.

3355
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:50,110
When does he stop?

3356
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:51,090
There's a...

3357
02:14:52,510 --> 02:14:53,570
Oh, I got Red Candy!

3358
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:53,970
Yay!

3359
02:14:56,830 --> 02:14:59,390
I was gonna say, I don't think I want to talk to him for a while.

3360
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:00,330
Ah.

3361
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:01,190
Oh.

3362
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:03,730
The ocean is so nice this time of year.

3363
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:06,490
Or my head would let me float in the water.

3364
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:08,490
Who would have a Whistle?

3365
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,220
I know I've talked to a lot of them already.

3366
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,520
So I'm like, which one have I not talked to?

3367
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:24,550
Yeah, I was gonna say, you seem like you talk a lot.

3368
02:15:25,330 --> 02:15:29,930
So I was like, I don't think I want to listen.

3369
02:15:34,210 --> 02:15:34,610
Got...

3370
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:35,270
Which one?

3371
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:37,130
Is it just the one free roaming?

3372
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:40,110
Toad is just like Doki for real, for real.

3373
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:41,030
The king of...

3374
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:41,710
Yeah, for king.

3375
02:15:42,190 --> 02:15:43,310
Palm, thank you for the super chat.

3376
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:43,630
Thank you.

3377
02:15:43,790 --> 02:15:44,250
Thank you.

3378
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:45,070
Thank you.

3379
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:47,610
Hey, which one is it?

3380
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:54,060
I feel like I talked to all of them already.

3381
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:56,840
Are they in the houses?

3382
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:58,100
Or like, are they just roaming?

3383
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:01,740
Oh!

3384
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:04,080
Oh my god, he was outside.

3385
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,420
You could have just said outside the building.

3386
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:07,600
That...

3387
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,900
Oh, don't worry.

3388
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:10,980
Currently have a Yoshi.

3389
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:12,660
In your party or not.

3390
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,180
Like I said, it's magic.

3391
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:16,040
Oh my god.

3392
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:18,740
You could have just said it's outside.

3393
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:23,980
Alright, where is...

3394
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:25,680
Key items.

3395
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:27,640
Register.

3396
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:28,940
List.

3397
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:32,160
Yay!

3398
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:33,620
Oh, never mind.

3399
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:38,140
Can't use that in there.

3400
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:39,060
Why not?

3401
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,100
He has rights.

3402
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:41,320
He has rights.

3403
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:44,800
Wee!

3404
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:45,640
Yeah.

3405
02:16:49,330 --> 02:16:49,990
Okay.

3406
02:16:51,830 --> 02:16:52,910
I'm not...

3407
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:54,010
I'm not doing...

3408
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:56,830
I'm not doing the wild encounters in this area anymore.

3409
02:16:57,130 --> 02:16:58,850
I think it's just spranglers now.

3410
02:16:59,810 --> 02:17:00,850
Alright, let's...

3411
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:01,550
Let's go fishing!

3412
02:17:02,530 --> 02:17:05,250
I want to catch the one with the big lips.

3413
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:08,730
Got the good rod.

3414
02:17:09,030 --> 02:17:09,450
Register.

3415
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:10,010
Select.

3416
02:17:10,010 --> 02:17:10,090
Select.

3417
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:12,410
Yay!

3418
02:17:15,210 --> 02:17:17,510
Give me the one with the big lips!

3419
02:17:18,470 --> 02:17:18,930
The fuck?

3420
02:17:20,210 --> 02:17:21,210
That's in...

3421
02:17:21,210 --> 02:17:22,410
64 too, right?

3422
02:17:24,710 --> 02:17:25,970
It's so familiar.

3423
02:17:27,890 --> 02:17:29,030
Get stick bugged.

3424
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:30,770
Yeah, I got stick bugged.

3425
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:33,790
Leave that fish.

3426
02:17:33,930 --> 02:17:35,230
It's time to lick it.

3427
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:42,550
It's time to lick the bug.

3428
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:45,970
Get scuttle bugged.

3429
02:17:55,890 --> 02:17:56,450
Alright.

3430
02:17:57,150 --> 02:17:57,830
Catch time!

3431
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:01,650
Oh!

3432
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:03,810
Oh wait, I thought I did like more damage.

3433
02:18:04,130 --> 02:18:05,810
But that was Dragoon's house for some reason.

3434
02:18:05,810 --> 02:18:13,310
Oh yeah, I was gonna say, the reason why I don't play Pokemon games on stream is that I personally don't like the formulaic of Pokemon games usually.

3435
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:20,610
But because this is Mario, I, I, I figured I'd give it a shot just because it's like different and I figured they would like do experiment more with it.

3436
02:18:27,970 --> 02:18:28,370
Yay!

3437
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:30,750
I caught the Skeeter!

3438
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:35,890
Alright, who wants to be the Skeeter?

3439
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:39,030
Who wants to be the stick bug?

3440
02:18:39,790 --> 02:18:43,870
A water-dwelling insect that is light enough to stand on the water surface.

3441
02:18:44,370 --> 02:18:47,910
Its aura is said to negatively affect the emotions of nearby trainers.

3442
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:49,270
Alright.

3443
02:18:49,830 --> 02:18:50,850
It's stick bugged.

3444
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:53,850
Alright, El.

3445
02:18:54,890 --> 02:18:56,830
You can be a stick bug!

3446
02:18:59,790 --> 02:19:01,750
I feel like you were gonna snap any moment.

3447
02:19:07,430 --> 02:19:08,130
Alright.

3448
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:09,990
I need a catch.

3449
02:19:11,170 --> 02:19:13,330
I need a catch big lips.

3450
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:16,190
God damn it.

3451
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:16,890
It's another...

3452
02:19:16,890 --> 02:19:18,810
I got stick bugged again.

3453
02:19:19,590 --> 02:19:21,790
I got fucking stick bugged again.

3454
02:19:22,350 --> 02:19:24,370
God fucking damn it.

3455
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:25,850
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3456
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:32,910
Oh, sheep sheep.

3457
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:34,670
I can't stick bug.

3458
02:19:38,650 --> 02:19:40,430
I need to catch big lips.

3459
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:45,610
Come on, give me my big lips.

3460
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:46,970
Oh, hey, this was good.

3461
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:48,130
Oh, no, no, it's alright.

3462
02:19:48,330 --> 02:19:48,670
It's alright.

3463
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:50,550
I want to get fishbone, too.

3464
02:19:54,750 --> 02:19:56,190
It's licking time.

3465
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:58,150
Go in, dragon.

3466
02:19:58,830 --> 02:20:00,230
Lick for Dokio.

3467
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:03,570
It doesn't help I'm wearing this mustache, too.

3468
02:20:06,370 --> 02:20:10,770
It really doesn't help that I'm wearing this mustache when I say that.

3469
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:14,850
Wait, wait a minute.

3470
02:20:15,070 --> 02:20:15,590
Wait, wait, wait.

3471
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:16,410
Okay.

3472
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:19,110
Let's see it.

3473
02:20:19,290 --> 02:20:19,990
Let me see it.

3474
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:20,450
Okay.

3475
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:24,430
Okay.

3476
02:20:24,430 --> 02:20:25,130
I have an... No!

3477
02:20:25,810 --> 02:20:27,530
The licking was too strong!

3478
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:32,570
You licked too hard!

3479
02:20:35,650 --> 02:20:37,250
Okay, wait, wait, guys.

3480
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:40,830
I have an idea before... before I keep going.

3481
02:20:40,830 --> 02:20:41,990
I have an idea.

3482
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:54,230
Let me disappear for a second.

3483
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:57,110
I've got something important to do.

3484
02:20:57,590 --> 02:20:58,030
I...

3485
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:02,650
This is very important, guys.

3486
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:03,990
Where is it?

3487
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:05,710
Where is it?

3488
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:07,990
Where is it the thing I want to do?

3489
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:09,110
Where is it?

3490
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:10,510
Okay.

3491
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:20,190
Where is it?

3492
02:21:20,970 --> 02:21:21,830
There's no way.

3493
02:21:22,470 --> 02:21:23,670
That actually already...

3494
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:28,210
Don't worry, guys.

3495
02:21:28,830 --> 02:21:29,970
It's worth...

3496
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:30,790
Oh, I do!

3497
02:21:31,390 --> 02:21:32,370
I do!

3498
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:32,570
Ew.

3499
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:39,130
Let me see... I forgot about that.

3500
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:41,690
You guys must be so confused.

3501
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:43,650
Like, what is she talking about?

3502
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:47,330
What is she talking about right now?

3503
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,900
Okay, wait.

3504
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:19,970
That's right, Dragoon.

3505
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:21,570
Look for Tokyo.

3506
02:22:30,790 --> 02:22:31,470
Look for Tokyo.

3507
02:22:31,490 --> 02:22:44,590
Look for Tokyo.

3508
02:23:03,650 --> 02:23:04,850
No!

3509
02:23:05,770 --> 02:23:06,970
Stop!

3510
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:12,090
It's the reason I met.

3511
02:23:12,570 --> 02:23:14,770
That's enough for today.

3512
02:23:15,350 --> 02:23:15,650
Yay!

3513
02:23:19,010 --> 02:23:19,690
Don't worry.

3514
02:23:20,770 --> 02:23:21,910
We need to grab one.

3515
02:23:25,450 --> 02:23:26,810
Is it a big fish?

3516
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:28,570
No!

3517
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:31,770
This is a wild Tokyo.

3518
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:33,450
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

3519
02:23:33,610 --> 02:23:33,850
Thank you.

3520
02:23:34,230 --> 02:23:37,550
Wait, let me catch the... I need to catch the two fishes!

3521
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:44,360
God damn it!

3522
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:46,140
Stop stick bugging me!

3523
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:50,060
Stop stick bugging me!

3524
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:55,420
I need... I need the fish!

3525
02:23:58,440 --> 02:23:59,000
Stop!

3526
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:01,740
Wait, no one told me to fish... Oh my god.

3527
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:02,740
I swear to god.

3528
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:05,020
Is the fishbone one a rare encounter?

3529
02:24:05,020 --> 02:24:06,660
I didn't realize.

3530
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:10,240
I forgot ghost type is weak against ghost type.

3531
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:13,360
Or dark... Oh wait, he's licking his dark side.

3532
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:15,200
Ghost type is weak against dark.

3533
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:18,280
No!

3534
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:22,740
I brought my camera and everything!

3535
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:30,170
I mean, he caught the big fish here.

3536
02:24:30,710 --> 02:24:32,350
Stop stick bugging!

3537
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:34,930
Oh, is it ghost?

3538
02:24:35,130 --> 02:24:36,050
No, lick is ghost.

3539
02:24:36,210 --> 02:24:38,390
Yeah, I didn't... Oh yeah, I didn't realize ghost type was weak.

3540
02:24:38,390 --> 02:24:38,910
I forgot.

3541
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:41,670
I forgot ghost type is weak against ghost.

3542
02:24:59,690 --> 02:25:01,850
Oh my

3543
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:06,740
god, it's just stick bug!

3544
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:09,060
It's the...

3545
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:11,260
It's...

3546
02:25:11,260 --> 02:25:13,960
It's still stick bug!

3547
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:16,420
Oh my god.

3548
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:16,900
Come on!

3549
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:22,440
Oh my god, it's out of here.

3550
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:26,280
I didn't realize fishbone was a rare encounter.

3551
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:31,180
I'm always getting stick bugged or cheep cheep.

3552
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,520
I can't believe it.

3553
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:36,920
Okay, I'm gonna do two more.

3554
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:38,640
I'm gonna do two more, guys.

3555
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:40,700
Two more.

3556
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:44,360
I'm gonna do two more.

3557
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:46,840
There has to be another one.

3558
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:47,720
No!

3559
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:51,780
I brought the camera for nothing!

3560
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:59,520
I brought the camera for nothing!

3561
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:02,480
Are you fucking kidding me?

3562
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:06,200
It's just stick bug!

3563
02:26:07,300 --> 02:26:10,480
The game gets stick bugged.

3564
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,640
There has to be...

3565
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:18,320
There has to be another...

3566
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:19,380
Oh my god!

3567
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:21,260
Okay, one... two more, two more.

3568
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:22,040
I'll do two more.

3569
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:23,560
I'll do two more.

3570
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:28,900
I can't stick bugged.

3571
02:26:29,180 --> 02:26:29,680
Again.

3572
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:32,280
The game...

3573
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:32,460
The game...

3574
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:32,680
Yes!

3575
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:34,460
Okay, I now know.

3576
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:35,140
I know now.

3577
02:26:35,240 --> 02:26:35,780
I know now.

3578
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:38,980
Oh, but I don't have any weak ma...

3579
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:40,360
Okay, maybe vine whip?

3580
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,400
Maybe vine whip will be good.

3581
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:43,960
I know like...

3582
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:44,960
Oh, but you're level 20.

3583
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:47,720
I'll try vine whip.

3584
02:26:51,170 --> 02:26:52,590
Maybe grass type.

3585
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:58,580
It's water ghost!

3586
02:26:59,020 --> 02:26:59,780
Oh no!

3587
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:00,800
I'll stun it then.

3588
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:02,120
I'm gonna stun it.

3589
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:03,440
I forgot.

3590
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:07,480
I just saw dead fish and then I was like, it's dead!

3591
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:11,380
Grass can't hurt you no more!

3592
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:17,360
Oh wait, why did I bring it?

3593
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,040
Oh wait.

3594
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:19,560
Why did I bring the camera?

3595
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:20,940
I'm doing normal things.

3596
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:26,440
Alright.

3597
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:28,340
Don't worry dra...

3598
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:30,520
Don't worry dragoons.

3599
02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:31,900
Filming...

3600
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:34,940
Dragoons first battle!

3601
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:37,180
It's like I'm at a baseball game, right?

3602
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:38,100
This is like...

3603
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:38,940
Guys, I'm...

3604
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:39,540
I'm like...

3605
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:40,340
It's like...

3606
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:40,660
You know...

3607
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:41,860
I'm being very wholesome.

3608
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:44,360
It's dragoons first battle!

3609
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:45,680
Wow!

3610
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,180
Look at him growing up.

3611
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:54,480
Yeah, like a good father.

3612
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:55,360
Look at that.

3613
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:56,320
I'm so wholesome.

3614
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:58,060
This is why I have a camera on.

3615
02:27:58,620 --> 02:27:59,220
Wow!

3616
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:00,920
Look at you go, son!

3617
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,720
Look at you go!

3618
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:05,880
Wow!

3619
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:07,740
Good job!

3620
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:07,940
No!

3621
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:09,140
Run!

3622
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:10,840
Run for the home run!

3623
02:28:15,580 --> 02:28:16,140
Yay!

3624
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:20,600
Okay, you go!

3625
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:21,540
You go, son!

3626
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,740
That's my dragoon!

3627
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:27,740
That's my dragoon!

3628
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:28,320
Oh my god!

3629
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:34,120
Okay.

3630
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:35,160
Nice.

3631
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:37,500
A fish skeleton.

3632
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:40,620
It hungers for the blood and flesh it once had.

3633
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:44,740
Setting its sights on the first living thing in its future.

3634
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:46,030
Best in the bisque.

3635
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,000
Okay!

3636
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:50,300
Who wants to be the dead fish?

3637
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:57,620
It's ghost and aquatic and it's basically me.

3638
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:58,540
Pretty please.

3639
02:28:58,660 --> 02:29:00,160
Thank you for the super chat, orca!

3640
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:01,220
Thank you, thank you.

3641
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,520
Are you also dead inside?

3642
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:04,180
Good for you!

3643
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:05,380
I mean...

3644
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:11,560
Orca...

3645
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:11,760
Orca...

3646
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,000
Gooon!

3647
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:15,040
Oh.

3648
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:16,460
Nice!

3649
02:29:19,140 --> 02:29:19,500
Yeah!

3650
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:23,140
Alright, I'm gonna call it here, because we have Good Night Dragons soon.

3651
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:24,840
Uh, but it was fun!

3652
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:29,700
I streamed longer than two hours, but I was actually- I was having a lot of fun.

3653
02:29:29,900 --> 02:29:34,000
If my throat wasn't dying, we didn't have another stream tonight, um, I would keep going.

3654
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:38,020
But, I've been having a lot of fun with this series, and I hope you guys have been too.

3655
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:46,200
Guys, uh, I'm gonna raid my stream into Good Night Dragons, and I'm gonna push the stream maybe like 15 minutes back.

3656
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:48,220
Just so I can have a little longer rest.

3657
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:50,660
But, thank you everybody for watching today!

3658
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:53,180
I hope you guys had a lot of fun!

3659
02:29:55,560 --> 02:30:01,480
Um, it's always fun hanging out with you guys, and I'm glad to have, like, more, like, you know, audience participation in this one.

3660
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:08,460
Um, and I know it's really hard to get named, but I'm trying my best to, like, balance out the namings and stuff for the dragons.

3661
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:16,080
Uh, but I hope you guys are enjoying, uh, you know, participating and being more involved in this game, compared to the other games I play.

3662
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:17,080
Anyway, guys!

3663
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:23,300
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, watch your check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing!

3664
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:25,900
And if you slept for me, head to bed!

3665
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:27,680
Cause, you deserve it!

3666
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,800
I'll see you guys next time, everybody!

3667
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:31,060
Bye, guys!

3668
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:31,880
Bye!

3669
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:32,320
Bye!
