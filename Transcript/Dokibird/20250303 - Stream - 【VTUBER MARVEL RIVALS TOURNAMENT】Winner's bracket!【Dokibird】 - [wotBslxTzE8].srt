1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,660
We're all streaming now.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,820
You were gonna say it.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,780
You were about to say it.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,660
You were so close.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,680
You were so close.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,920
Oh shit, wait, what was I gonna say?

7
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,280
Fuck.

8
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,240
You know.

9
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,640
You know exactly what you're gonna say.

10
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,660
You know that you're fucking right.

11
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,080
Wait, what?

12
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

13
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,760
What the?

14
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,920
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,740
Hold on, we weren't ready.

16
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,040
We didn't even...

17
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,920
What the fuck?

18
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,020
They just started asking us?

19
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,040
Please ask us when we are...

20
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,200
If we are...

21
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,240
We are...

22
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,060
Are...

23
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,980
Before starting.

24
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,860
Yeah, I'm like, what?

25
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,640
Okay, we're banning Groot.

26
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,240
We banned Groot first because he wasted Protect on Namor.

27
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,940
Wait, are we playing?

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,400
Is this it?

29
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,380
Wait, the other team's not ready either.

30
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,120
Who started it then?

31
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,040
We were not...

32
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,840
They were not ready either?

33
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay, ban Groot.

34
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,760
It was the caster.

35
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,760
I think it was the caster that...

36
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,920
Yeah, it was the one.

37
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,720
Wait, should we not do real bans then?

38
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,420
Or what's going on?

39
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,720
No, we're doing real bans.

40
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,960
This is like our bad line.

41
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,380
We're playing?

42
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,960
Okay.

43
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,680
Yeah, because like, the thing is, they always protect DPS.

44
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,620
So if they protect Namor, they wasted their...

45
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,680
Okay, they didn't protect Namor.

46
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,120
But I'm just trying to see if they'll waste their Protection on that.

47
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,100
Protect Mag.

48
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,960
Yeah, we protect Mag here always.

49
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,720
And then now who we ban here?

50
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,680
Namor or Deluna?

51
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,180
I don't know.

52
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,540
We ban Luna here.

53
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,140
Okay.

54
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,760
They play Bucky too, right?

55
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,240
Yeah.

56
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,540
I think he's more important.

57
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,040
But their Eternity player doesn't play Bucky.

58
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,300
Is this 2 out of 3?

59
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,140
Yeah, best out of 3.

60
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,460
They researched.

61
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,120
That's fine.

62
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,420
They did the research.

63
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,040
Look at them.

64
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
Finally.

65
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,540
Oh my god.

66
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,020
Oh my god.

67
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,720
Alright, so we can either run the normal 2-2-2 comp.

68
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,560
Or we can do a mix-up of the 3-support Bucky.

69
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,300
Let's try 3-support Bucky first.

70
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,780
Because we're attacking first, so we can easily swap.

71
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:14,880
Alright.

72
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,800
If it doesn't work, we'll just run triple or Shoto swap-swap support.

73
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah.

74
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,560
And I can do... I don't know, Hella or something.

75
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,100
We'll see.

76
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,140
Ooh, Adam's duty.

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
Let's go.

78
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Also, to my chat.

79
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, my team's Celestial now.

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
We did some late-night grinding.

81
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,520
We did some...

82
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,920
Yeah, we did some late-night grinding where we got the rest of our team to Celestial.

83
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,000
Coney may have carried my ass.

84
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,640
Yeah, Coney.

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,020
Coney was the MVP.

86
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,540
Gomez jumped off the cliff and then Coney went in and stole the MVP.

87
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
I was told to in my battle.

88
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
It was his choice.

89
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,680
Yeah, it was his choice.

90
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,500
He chose to jump off.

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,620
Oh, let's see how you guys play.

92
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Oh, they're on their penny?

93
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,100
Interesting.

94
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,200
That's interesting.

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Cool.

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,660
They have Bucky.

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,680
Coney's low, breaking the mine.

98
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,720
Yeah, I'll push Hella soon.

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,300
Hella's dead.

100
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,940
Hella should die.

101
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,220
Nice, let's push in.

102
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,540
I'm gonna Soulbond us.

103
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,980
I'm Soulbonding us so we can push in.

104
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,780
Push up, push up.

105
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm healing.

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,080
No Soulbond.

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,720
No more Soulbond.

108
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,040
Bucky grabbed.

109
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm fine.

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,600
He's one.

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,360
What the?

112
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,940
Shouldn't she die?

113
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,420
Penny, penny, penny, penny, penny one.

114
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,420
Loki up top.

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,440
Invis?

116
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:07,780
Yeah.

117
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,700
Good job.

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,000
Nice.

119
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,280
We don't need that thing.

120
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,120
I do, but you guys got it.

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,500
Someone's invisible, someone's invisible.

122
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,180
I hear him, I hear him.

123
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,200
Someone's invisible.

124
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,120
I think they backed out.

125
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,080
I think it was Loki.

126
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,880
Yeah, I hear someone up here.

127
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,180
That's fine.

128
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,540
Mag.

129
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
Maybe the Loki.

130
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,400
I think you heard Loki's Invis.

131
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Yeah, it's probably Loki.

132
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,520
Oh, there was nobody there.

133
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:42,780
Okay.

134
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Oh, he shifted.

135
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,480
Loki shifted.

136
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,840
I have no ammo.

137
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,360
I have no ammo.

138
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,620
Bucky on the left.

139
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,920
Bucky on the left.

140
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,040
That's spot.

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,500
Yeah, it's Loki out of position here.

142
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,440
Nice, nice.

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

144
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,460
I'm Soulbonding.

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Push up, push up if you want.

146
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,540
I'm Soulbonding.

147
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:01,960
Oh, okay.

148
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,620
Nevermind.

149
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,120
Alright, that's...

150
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Behind us.

151
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,280
I can counter this.

152
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:07,800
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,720
Oh, they ulted too.

154
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,220
Okay, that's fine.

155
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,780
Okay, that's double.

156
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,780
That's both their support ults.

157
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,660
That's both their support ults.

158
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,120
Yeah, they both, they used both their support.

159
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,640
We still have ours.

160
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm Agumoto-ing.

161
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm gonna shift up and drop in back.

162
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,020
Okay.

163
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,480
Oh, they ulted.

164
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing.

165
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing.

166
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,980
That's huge, that's huge.

167
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,200
Nice, good, good.

168
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,540
Nice.

169
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,880
Push up, push up, push up.

170
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

171
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,120
Yeah, we're pushing out here.

172
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,180
You guys are fine, you guys are fine.

173
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,760
I'll push cart.

174
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,660
One support push up with them.

175
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,420
One of them push up with them.

176
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,900
I'll push cart.

177
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,500
Burn this, burn this, burn this, burn this, burn this.

178
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,680
Oh my god.

179
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,780
She's gone.

180
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,920
She's fucking gone.

181
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,400
We were on top of that.

182
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,420
Holy shit.

183
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,800
I hope he's swapping off Hella because that was not inspirational.

184
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,340
Whoa.

185
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,920
Goddamn.

186
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,840
Oh my god, he's committing to the Hella pick after that.

187
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,040
I'd be a little embarrassed and swap off.

188
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,960
And be like, guys, I was just changing ults.

189
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,320
That's a whole ult he just like used up.

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,420
Nice.

191
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,120
They have Mag ult by the way.

192
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,260
I'm saving my Soul Bond for it.

193
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
Trying to shield you?

194
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:24,880
Alright.

195
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
Okay, of course, let's go for that.

196
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,360
Yeah, that's like his worst.

197
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah, that's good for us.

198
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,540
I have ult soon too.

199
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:29,940
Nice.

200
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,080
Hella's on top, or was.

201
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,660
Okay, okay.

202
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,580
I'm saving Soul Bond for Mag ult.

203
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,060
Push up.

204
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,460
Good shit.

205
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:36,960
Keep pushing up.

206
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,820
We have three picks.

207
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,160
There's no reason to play.

208
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,620
I have ult now.

209
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,260
We can get active here.

210
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,100
Push up, push up, push up.

211
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,960
At him, at him.

212
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,000
Can't finish it.

213
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,660
Strange, strange one, strange one.

214
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,160
Got it, got it.

215
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,800
I got you, I got you.

216
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,340
I'm with you, I'm with you.

217
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,320
I'll push up with you.

218
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,040
Did you almost fall down?

219
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,180
Low keyed him here?

220
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,580
Yeah, low keyed.

221
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,680
Where'd he go?

222
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,420
He's invis.

223
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,400
He's so sneaky.

224
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,180
We got door.

225
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,990
They still have Mag ult.

226
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,930
They might be close to our Strange ult here.

227
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,490
Or wait.

228
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,110
I'm low, I'm low.

229
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,650
He is, cause I am.

230
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,170
Go back quick.

231
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,270
Boink.

232
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,070
Missed.

233
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,950
Just chill for a second.

234
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,690
Yeah, I'm not there.

235
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,650
To our left, there is.

236
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,030
There's Adam to our left.

237
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,790
There's four Soul Bond.

238
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,690
Okay, I'm back, I'm back.

239
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,970
Adam to the left again.

240
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,210
We're behind door.

241
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,790
Strange has ult.

242
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,990
He's probably gonna pop it soon.

243
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,310
I'm on, I'm on.

244
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,890
Let's push, let's play it a little.

245
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,070
Up here, up here, up here.

246
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,610
I'm Soul Bonding, I'm Soul Bonding.

247
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,950
I don't have Soul Bond after this.

248
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,230
Got the reset, got the reset.

249
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,570
Strange 1, Strange 1, Strange 1.

250
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,430
Yeah, yeah, I'm with you.

251
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,630
He's Soul Bonding, he's Soul Bonding.

252
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,690
I can ult this if we have enough.

253
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,810
We're even, we're even right now.

254
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,270
We're up, we're up, we're up.

255
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:11,970
Okay, popping it.

256
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,930
I'm with you, Doki, I'm with you.

257
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,610
I am trying to keep everybody up right now.

258
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,650
I'm keeping you guys alive.

259
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,470
We're up, we're up, we're up, we're up.

260
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,650
Yeah, we're up, we're up.

261
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,190
I'm Soul Bonding you.

262
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,500
I don't mind.

263
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm gonna try and see if I can get the kill.

264
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,600
All these fucking Loki clones.

265
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,680
Look at Thor, behind us, look at Thor.

266
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,180
Alright, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

267
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,200
Strange 1, Strange 2 left, Strange 2 left, Strange 2 left.

268
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,730
We need like a pick here.

269
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,170
I'm getting shot at, I'm getting shot at.

270
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,570
I'm getting rid of the clones for us.

271
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,130
Alright, look at Thor, look at Thor.

272
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,390
Thor 1, Thor 1, Thor 1, good pick.

273
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,450
Strange 1.

274
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,330
I lost my, I lost my HUD.

275
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,350
What the fuck was that?

276
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,650
That's weird.

277
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,030
But I couldn't see my ult.

278
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,850
Look at the Embers, we're here.

279
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,770
I missed.

280
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,790
I can't see anybody.

281
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,590
Good to know, I'm 1.

282
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,450
Yeah.

283
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,290
Alright, let's go.

284
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,390
I think we might need to swap some.

285
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,690
I don't know if we swap some or we just get ults or something.

286
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,770
I have a portal, I have a portal.

287
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,350
Yeah, let's just portal.

288
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,250
Portal behind them.

289
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,550
Okay.

290
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,870
Portal behind.

291
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,430
Yeah, because we need to get the supports.

292
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,870
The supports are just healing them.

293
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,210
Alright, I'm going to TP.

294
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,510
Get back, Gabe.

295
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,110
Alright, I'm just going to go behind them, right?

296
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,370
Yep, get behind.

297
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,650
We'll do the thing where you put Emo and then I'll...

298
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,250
Okay, you take Emo.

299
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,550
You want me to ult?

300
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,230
No, I'm going to ult.

301
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,090
I'm going to take your ult first.

302
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:55,750
Okay.

303
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,330
I have the ult.

304
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,730
I got stun, I got stun, I got stun.

305
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,410
I'm still bot, I'm still bot, I'm still bot, I'm still bot.

306
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:02,450
Don't worry.

307
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,730
I'm trapping in there.

308
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,550
I don't know what that was.

309
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,570
Yeah, we need ult, we need invis ult.

310
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,830
Oh my god, I got pushed away.

311
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,010
Ela's behind us.

312
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,310
I can't...

313
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,850
I'm going back, I'm going back now.

314
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm going to rez here.

315
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,290
Oh, they're all over us.

316
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,430
Oh, you guys are so far.

317
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,850
Fuck, that was my bad.

318
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,450
I didn't realize you guys were actually there, there.

319
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,650
I'm going to swap off then.

320
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,250
I think we need more.

321
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,830
Yeah.

322
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,570
Their invis is good, man.

323
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
She's fucking me up.

324
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,570
I didn't realize you guys were all the way there.

325
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,450
They were portaling.

326
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,190
I don't know what this is.

327
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,890
But we're here, though.

328
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,810
Behind us?

329
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,430
I shifted.

330
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,390
I'm trying to drop us in the pit.

331
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,390
Hold on Thor, hold on Thor.

332
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,950
No one more?

333
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,350
Oh wait, Thor's caught off.

334
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,130
Sunny, I...

335
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,530
I'm low.

336
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,130
Hold in there, Ela.

337
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,330
I see, I see.

338
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,190
Nice, nice.

339
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,350
Oh, we're fine.

340
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,190
Maybe?

341
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,550
I'm giving up, I'm giving up.

342
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,930
Oh my god.

343
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,190
I blinded the Thor.

344
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,850
Oh, the Thor's behind us here.

345
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,190
I didn't think I was that low.

346
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:24,730
Thor one.

347
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,370
Did she end?

348
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,990
Nice, nice, nice.

349
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,450
We have...

350
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,350
It's just you healing.

351
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,670
They're gonna buy, they're gonna buy.

352
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:30,870
Nice, nice, nice.

353
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,450
We only have Shuriken.

354
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,470
You only have Shuriken.

355
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,070
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,950
I'm gonna back up a bit.

357
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,370
I hit.

358
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:40,650
I'm gonna die.

359
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,850
Oh my god.

360
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,900
That last point was so fucking hard to push into.

361
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,880
We need like a...

362
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,100
I think we just have to use all the ults we can there.

363
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,840
When we used the portal, I tried to ult, but I got stunned.

364
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,900
But I think we should have had Lime ult after that immediately.

365
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,660
Yeah, I didn't know if I should drop mine or if you were able to drop yours.

366
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,460
No, I was not.

367
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,440
Yeah, I got stunned.

368
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,300
For this, do you want more heals or do you want to keep with Adam?

369
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,720
So...

370
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,960
For now, we should keep the Adam.

371
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,000
We shouldn't have a problem with holding Ziphon.

372
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,620
But...

373
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,780
I think if it does get worse, I can swap off and then I can go Hella.

374
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
And then Shadow can go Bucky.

375
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,060
Yeah, yeah.

376
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,960
Or I can go Wolverine.

377
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,140
I think that last point, we should have swapped there because it wasn't working.

378
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,220
We were just trying to brute force.

379
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,040
Do either one.

380
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,360
Yeah, we should be proactive with our swaps there if something's not working.

381
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,420
Yeah.

382
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,240
It's fine, let's hold this.

383
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,400
Two!

384
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,150
Stay strong!

385
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,270
They did a little research on the cones.

386
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,250
I mean, to be fair, Coney never swapped off the thing the entire time.

387
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,750
I played a couple of mech games, I think.

388
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,410
No, you were on the thing the entire tournament.

389
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,990
Oh, wait, I wasn't?

390
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:10,330
Yeah.

391
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,970
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one!

392
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,930
We can always swap if you want, Mag, and I can Strange if need be.

393
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,230
They're going to portal up here.

394
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,030
Because you're a little bit more practiced recently, you know?

395
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,270
They're portaling.

396
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,950
Oh, is it inside?

397
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:30,910
Top.

398
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,170
Yeah.

399
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,010
Strange, oh, no, they healed him.

400
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,470
So we're on the backline?

401
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,450
I got you.

402
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,210
Yeah, Thor's back here.

403
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,270
Come on, Thor.

404
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,110
Four, one.

405
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,930
They're low up there.

406
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,190
In the back.

407
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,430
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor!

408
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,770
Nice!

409
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:51,870
Got it.

410
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,950
Still pulling.

411
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,490
Adam here.

412
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,350
Adam is by himself, Adam by himself, Adam by himself, focus on Adam, focus on Adam!

413
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,710
I'm low up here.

414
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,150
Yeah.

415
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,590
They're low up there.

416
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,130
You can clean them up, you can clean them up.

417
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,070
Oh, I got...

418
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,110
This Hela pulled up for me the whole time, I just needed my time.

419
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,410
Yeah, I tried, sorry.

420
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,810
I still bonded us because I'm getting picked by the Hela, too.

421
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,350
Like, everybody's just everywhere.

422
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,350
They're all just surrounding us.

423
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,490
Yeah.

424
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,970
Yeah, I'm gonna go down here.

425
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,250
Do we stay with this comp or is it just...

426
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,890
No, we can swap it up.

427
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,270
Yeah, just swap off, yeah.

428
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,570
Do I even try?

429
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,130
I don't know.

430
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,170
No, don't do it.

431
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,810
That's fine.

432
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,870
A little bit of delay, I guess.

433
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,230
I go Hela.

434
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,330
Hela.

435
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,270
Alright, Hela here.

436
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,230
Let me get the buck.

437
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,710
Okay, I'll swap to...

438
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,390
I'll swap to...

439
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,470
I guess I'll swap to Cloak after this for the heals.

440
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:56,930
Hela?

441
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,430
I'm still bonding to keep Coney alive.

442
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,750
Hela top, Hela top, Hela top.

443
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,730
Yeah, just know we don't have as many heals.

444
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,010
We might have to get another heal in.

445
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going to Cloak after.

446
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,430
I just need to die.

447
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,810
Is that Thor behind us?

448
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,710
Thor, yeah.

449
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,350
That's fine.

450
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,630
You're giving them a lot of space though.

451
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,090
I'm pulling him.

452
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:22,630
Nice.

453
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,410
I have ult here.

454
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,770
We need to start bucking now.

455
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,130
Just in, just in, I have ult.

456
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:28,990
Just in, just in.

457
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:29,390
We don't...

458
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,310
He's got ult.

459
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,090
I have ult behind, I have ult here.

460
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,730
Just in, just in.

461
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,490
Don't...

462
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,790
Don't use any defensive ults.

463
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,630
Yeah.

464
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,610
Alright, good shit.

465
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,710
There is an Adam behind.

466
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,950
On me, on me.

467
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,110
Actually, there's a strange on me.

468
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,310
Right here.

469
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,170
Oh, he's running.

470
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,130
He's off, he's off, he's off.

471
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,970
I'm going to look for a rez.

472
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,490
Just keep inting and then I'll try and get a rez for us.

473
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,570
And then, all at the moment we rez.

474
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,390
On top, on top, on top.

475
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,970
They're trying to do a drop.

476
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,810
They're trying to do a drop down.

477
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,610
Look behind, look behind, look behind.

478
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,420
Ah, the fucking roof.

479
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,060
I tried, I tried ulting but I immediately got Thor ulted as I rezzed.

480
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,500
That's fine.

481
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,380
Yeah, I'm rezzed.

482
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
That's fine, I'm going to jump off.

483
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,300
We have one fight here.

484
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,640
I could TP in, hold on.

485
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,520
I actually kept my ult, he killed me before it went off.

486
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,700
I'll save TP.

487
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,260
Can we touch?

488
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,120
Yeah, we can't touch here.

489
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
No, we can't touch that.

490
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,900
Alright, this is the last point.

491
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,380
Last point.

492
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,640
Play it back.

493
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,360
On top, on top, Thor's behind us.

494
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,740
He's going to try to flank, he's trying to flank right now.

495
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,980
Tanks, tanks, tanks, tanks.

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,040
Don't give him space, tanks, tanks.

497
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,640
Don't give him space.

498
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,720
We just need one person, one to two people.

499
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,140
Strange.

500
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,860
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

501
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
There's a Hela up top, Hela up top.

502
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,580
Hela one.

503
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,940
Yeah, she's low, she's low.

504
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,100
She's dead.

505
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,520
Yeah, I blinded them, I blinded them.

506
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,320
Nice,

507
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,430
nice, nice.

508
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,790
That's big, that's big.

509
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,730
Fuck that guy.

510
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,650
Help, help, help.

511
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,850
Cony, Cony, Cony, Cony, Cony.

512
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,050
Yep.

513
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,750
Good shit.

514
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,550
That's fine.

515
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:44,850
Right here.

516
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,190
That's fine.

517
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,230
I blinded them, I blinded all of them, I blinded all of them.

518
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,810
Dora here, low.

519
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,550
I got him.

520
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,550
Good shit.

521
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,630
Oh my god, I missed my ult in there.

522
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,890
It went off, but that's fine.

523
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,250
I don't know.

524
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,450
Okay, Lime, you ult first.

525
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,390
Double invisible.

526
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,050
Lime, you ult first, okay?

527
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:06,950
Okay.

528
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,030
Good.

529
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,150
I'm going to go up top.

530
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,090
And if you're stunned, like, shout it out and then I'll ult.

531
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,110
Because I'm playing back.

532
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,530
Dora's going for a flank again.

533
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,510
If you get stunned, I will, okay, Lime?

534
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,410
Dora behind us, Dora behind us.

535
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,010
He's low, he's low, he's low.

536
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,390
He's low, he's very low.

537
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,830
I stunned him, I, I...

538
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,710
Uh, I...

539
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,690
Oh, you didn't get stunned, that was my bad.

540
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,130
I thought you got stunned there.

541
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,410
No, I'm sorry.

542
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,190
That was my bad.

543
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,190
We stacked ults, we stacked ults.

544
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,110
That was my bad.

545
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:48,650
Yeah.

546
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,090
Atom almost down.

547
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:54,550
Got it.

548
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,410
There's a Thor, Thor behind us.

549
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,590
Thor, Thor's behind us, yeah, yeah.

550
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,310
We don't have support ults here, so they're going to have, uh, they have Hela and, uh, Thor ult after.

551
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,750
Nice, good kill, good kill.

552
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,690
I just popped shield for no reason.

553
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,930
I accidentally hit F, sorry.

554
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,270
Uh, we don't have any ults here, but they're going to have, they're going to have Hela and Thor ult.

555
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,550
Yeah.

556
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,130
I'm going to try to combo that shit, watch out.

557
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,470
If we can survive one fight, we'll be able to...

558
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,310
It sounds like Hela.

559
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:21,910
Shit.

560
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,790
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

561
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,710
It fucking glitched, what the fuck?

562
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,690
What happened?

563
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,650
We're giving them too much favor, we're giving them too much favor.

564
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,890
It showed that I was on the fucking platform and it dropped me off.

565
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,250
I'm trying to kill it, I'm trying to kill it.

566
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,370
There's no way.

567
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,790
Okay, it's dead, it's dead, it's dead.

568
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,410
Oh my god.

569
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,890
Oh, I got sniped by the fucking Hela.

570
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,150
Oh no.

571
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,030
I got sniped too.

572
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,950
Post ult, post ult.

573
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,370
We have...

574
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,910
Don't tell me you'll lose the fucking point of that.

575
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,210
Oh no.

576
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,030
Are you fucking kidding me?

577
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,330
No fucking shot, dude.

578
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:54,850
What?

579
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,070
Okay, well...

580
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,990
Can we touch or no?

581
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,490
We can, I think we can.

582
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,370
We have to go, we have to go.

583
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

584
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,390
I got it.

585
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,110
You got it?

586
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,390
Okay.

587
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,110
Coming back.

588
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,810
We have Lion Maul.

589
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,030
They're portal, they portal blocked, they portal blocked.

590
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,710
Nah, I can get out.

591
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,390
He didn't do it right.

592
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,410
I'm trying to get you guys.

593
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,750
Oh my god, bro.

594
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,650
Hella one.

595
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,170
Hella dead.

596
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,470
I have a Thor on me, but I'm just trying to get as close as I can.

597
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,950
Big kill, big kill.

598
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,670
Oh my god.

599
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,990
You can probably kill that.

600
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,630
See my...

601
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,750
Oh, there's a Hela behind, there's a Hela behind us.

602
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,010
No!

603
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,530
Fuck.

604
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,850
I should have popped it before.

605
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:37,990
Shit.

606
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,390
Yeah.

607
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,990
Are you fucking kidding me?

608
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,610
What do we do against this team?

609
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,250
I already know what to do.

610
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,910
I already know what to do.

611
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,030
We had a lot of mistakes with like...

612
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,470
Man, I'm so sad.

613
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,070
I don't know what happened there.

614
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,330
We were holding that well.

615
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,070
I don't know what happened.

616
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,730
Gomez jumped off.

617
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,290
Yeah, I know.

618
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,330
I thought I had more space to move, so I went backwards.

619
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,190
I think we definitely need to be more proactive with our swaps.

620
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,070
We were brute-forcing things again, which was our problem in the beginning of the games.

621
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,340
We kept brute-forcing...

622
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,410
We kept brute-forcing characters that we should not be brute-forcing.

623
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:28,830
Like, we stayed on Bucky for way too long there when we were obviously not going to progress in the first point.

624
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,490
Yeah.

625
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:31,990
Alright.

626
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,850
I don't even know what bandwagon we should do.

627
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,190
I think I already got it.

628
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,930
I'm ready to start up.

629
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,030
I can tell you guys about it.

630
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,130
I don't know.

631
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,710
Yeah, just be R.

632
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,810
Just R for it.

633
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,930
Also, it didn't help that they just started the game without asking us.

634
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,790
Oh, yeah.

635
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,370
One second.

636
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,490
Do you want to protect this game?

637
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,650
What do you think?

638
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,110
I'm down.

639
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,870
You probably have more experience on Strange because you were learning it.

640
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,670
So you probably play it better than I do right now.

641
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,350
So there's also a world where I can just Mag and you can Strange?

642
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,550
Mm-mm.

643
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,210
Okay.

644
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,050
Yeah, either or.

645
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,450
I'll take Strange duty.

646
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,270
If you're more comfortable on the other end.

647
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,930
The fuck?

648
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:30,690
Why did they just leave?

649
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,010
I just haven't played Strange in a while.

650
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,530
Or should we swap in Jay of their target band in Coney?

651
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,670
If we swap in Jay, they might try and target Ben.

652
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,830
No, we just save the thing.

653
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:44,490
Okay.

654
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,390
Save the thing.

655
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,790
Coney pops off.

656
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,110
And if they have the first band thing, then I have Star-Lord.

657
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,550
And then we do triple team up.

658
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,950
That's pretty strong too.

659
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,290
Or we can do Bucky Star-Lord.

660
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,190
Good also.

661
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,570
Nice.

662
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,570
And we got to go to their new lobby.

663
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,190
Okay.

664
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,690
Yeah, just join off me.

665
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:07,970
Alright, where are you?

666
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,070
Where are you?

667
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,170
There you are.

668
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,110
It says friends only.

669
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,690
Oh no, I only play.

670
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:16,970
Just join off me.

671
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,210
Yeah.

672
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,130
Okay.

673
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,670
Unlucky.

674
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,270
Oh, crap.

675
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,890
We have an imposter in our team.

676
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,710
There we go.

677
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,170
Dude.

678
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,740
So what are we doing differently this time around?

679
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,630
I think we're going to try and keep the thing.

680
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,850
So we're just going to keep the thing.

681
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,490
They want you to move into our team, Gomez.

682
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

683
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:17,990
I'm here.

684
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,190
We are alright, right?

685
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,930
We are ready, right?

686
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:23,650
I'm ready.

687
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,490
Yeah, okay.

688
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:24,990
I'm ready.

689
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,010
I'm good.

690
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,710
I'm the readies.

691
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,900
Yo, Hella is also just doing whatever the fuck she wants.

692
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,820
Like no one's like walking up to her.

693
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah, I was trying to stop her like in the back, like whenever she goes around back.

694
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,560
But then like, I think that last moment when Gomez died, she just got free reign because I couldn't hold her myself.

695
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,260
Yeah, like none of us are, none of us are challenging her.

696
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,720
Like, and their Hella is their best player.

697
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,960
So at the moment we shut down their Hella, like the team collapses.

698
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,600
Okay.

699
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,440
I think we gave a little too much space too.

700
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,820
Yeah, and that's why I was like, push up, keep pushing up.

701
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,660
Because like every time we said there's someone behind us, an entire team runs to that person.

702
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,700
Yeah, the tanks, the tanks can stay.

703
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,600
Yeah, the tanks stay.

704
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,180
Like when we say someone's behind us, we're just telling the DPS to walk around.

705
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,560
Yeah.

706
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,380
Really quick, do we want, do we want Jay for this or am I staying?

707
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,340
You're staying.

708
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,420
Okay.

709
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,560
So this time we're just going to protect the thing.

710
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,240
Because I thought they would, oh, they're probably going to ban your mag anyway.

711
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,040
Yeah, yeah.

712
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,680
Or they'll ban Star, no they're doing Starlord first ban.

713
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,460
No, for second ban.

714
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,300
Oh yes, yeah.

715
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,940
They're going to, they're going to first ban my Starlord.

716
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,540
Obviously then.

717
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,480
As long as we have, at least if we have the thing, we have a strong core frontline.

718
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,580
Then we still, then we can do whatever the hell we want.

719
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,740
I don't think we ban Luna, just so we can have the Namor option in.

720
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,040
Because I don't think, I think we can force them on the 2-2.

721
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Okay.

722
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,320
I think, I think Shoto's, Shoto's Namor is better.

723
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,340
Right, right Shoto?

724
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,220
Yes, yes.

725
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,460
So, who are we banning first then?

726
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,300
Uh, just keep the same ban line.

727
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,140
Just use...

728
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,980
Get Groot out here.

729
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,340
Get Groot out.

730
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,580
We don't like that thing.

731
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,440
We don't like Groot.

732
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,390
We're going to protect the thing.

733
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,330
They're going to protect Hala, then we protect the thing.

734
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,250
Then we just pull out the, we pull out the fucking Namor if we have to.

735
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,190
They're probably going to ban, they're probably going to ban Magneto.

736
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,890
And I think the best, I think, through how they were playing.

737
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,750
Yeah, and they played really well.

738
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,730
They kind of rely on the Invis.

739
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,910
You want to ban the Invis?

740
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,430
Because they pocket the Hala.

741
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,750
Yeah, the Invis was fucking me up when I was trained.

742
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,950
Get Invis out.

743
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:55,830
Get Invis out.

744
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,510
What am I playing then?

745
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,330
You'll be playing...

746
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,590
Atom?

747
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,050
Atom, yeah.

748
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,610
Okay, we'll do Atom Luna then.

749
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,430
If they ban, let's say ban Luna.

750
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,990
They want to pocket their Hala, which is annoying.

751
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,970
So something like this?

752
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,870
Or I could do Loki, I guess, right?

753
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,930
Yeah, either one.

754
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,470
Loki or Namor?

755
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,130
Yeah, you can do either one.

756
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,410
So now you have the option to swap between the two.

757
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,050
Let's start with Namor first.

758
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,630
Yeah, I agree.

759
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,810
Oh, attack again?

760
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,310
Help her be scanned a lot.

761
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,930
Yeah, we are.

762
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,750
I also think the Suu might have been fucking you up because you were strange and you didn't have the invulnerability, the displacement immunity.

763
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,410
That's something I have to worry about, usually.

764
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,660
So Hala shouldn't have that much free roam anymore?

765
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,100
Yeah, because if I have squids, it should be fine.

766
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,240
But he might play Namor too, right?

767
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,220
Yeah, he's a Namor main, so...

768
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,980
And at the moment, I think Bucky is better than Hala, so I can just play the Hala or the Bucky.

769
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,440
They're way better.

770
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,520
Oh, do you hear that?

771
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,340
He whoops my back.

772
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,840
It's a habit, that's all.

773
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,740
It's a nervous button mash.

774
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,820
I understand it.

775
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,080
Hala one.

776
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,040
Hala dead.

777
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,100
I'm gonna die though.

778
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,260
This is a good trade though.

779
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,580
Yeah, we're pushing it.

780
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,380
Does Hala get revived off that or is that just... No.

781
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,760
No, no, no.

782
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,420
It's only Hala that can revive others.

783
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,180
Okay, okay, okay.

784
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,460
Thor on me.

785
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,040
I froze Thor.

786
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,530
Don't ult her in front of him.

787
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,370
Don't ult her in front of him.

788
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,110
Okay, okay, okay.

789
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,890
I'll keep forward.

790
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,250
Thor half.

791
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,990
I'm gonna try to go around them.

792
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,210
Hala on the left.

793
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,410
Hala one.

794
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,730
Hala still one.

795
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,190
Oh, she's low.

796
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,730
Got her.

797
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,530
Damn!

798
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,090
I don't know.

799
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,750
Their Hala is just trying to get plays because all they can do is get picked and then their team collapse on us.

800
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,610
Yeah, I'm pushing up right now.

801
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,230
I'm pushing up right now.

802
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,030
Oh, this big guy is big.

803
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,590
Adam low.

804
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,050
Adam low.

805
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,550
I'm on them.

806
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,950
I'm with you.

807
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,290
I'm with you.

808
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,790
I'm with you.

809
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,270
Thor on me.

810
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,770
Thor on me.

811
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,250
Thor on me.

812
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,670
Thor on me.

813
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,030
Turn around.

814
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,170
Someone turn around.

815
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,390
Thor one.

816
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:38,890
Thor one.

817
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,290
Got Thor.

818
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,290
Got it.

819
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,430
Oh my god, I got destroyed by... Dude, their Adam just...

820
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,670
Adam.

821
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,070
Adam one.

822
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,150
Adam low.

823
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,670
Adam one.

824
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,930
Nice, nice.

825
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,270
Good job.

826
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:49,550
Good job.

827
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,670
101.

828
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,870
We're up one.

829
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,430
We're up one.

830
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,750
We won't take space.

831
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,410
We're up two.

832
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:02,970
We're up two.

833
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,130
Oh my god!

834
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:04,950
Come on, push up.

835
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:06,710
No way!

836
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,430
Those are nasty shots.

837
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:08,990
I'll push up.

838
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:09,470
I'll push up.

839
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,490
No, get over here.

840
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,310
Get your ass here, Hella.

841
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:11,850
Hold on.

842
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:14,930
I'm looking.

843
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,830
I'm looking, dude.

844
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,090
They have all their ults.

845
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:17,950
They haven't used anything.

846
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,810
So, they have Punisher on.

847
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,250
Oh, they did.

848
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,310
Punisher.

849
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,450
Punisher.

850
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:20,750
Punisher.

851
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,050
That's fine.

852
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,850
We get this spot.

853
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,250
This is like a free point.

854
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,750
I have Whale.

855
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,050
Save your Whale for me.

856
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,150
Save your Whale with my ult.

857
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,550
Nope.

858
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,330
I'm just laying down.

859
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,690
Punisher down.

860
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,990
Nice kill.

861
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,270
Nice kill.

862
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,350
They're low.

863
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:38,750
They're all low.

864
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,350
We should push up.

865
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,890
Push up with that.

866
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,670
You're up two.

867
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,190
You're up two.

868
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:41,750
You're up two.

869
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,710
Strange half.

870
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,370
Strange half.

871
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,790
Oh, I got Strange.

872
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,170
I got Strange.

873
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:48,550
I got Strange.

874
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,230
She's running.

875
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,810
Back up a little bit.

876
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,690
Don't play so frontline.

877
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,210
Frozen.

878
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,410
Good shit.

879
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,650
Oh, they wasted their ults.

880
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,470
Dude, that's so good.

881
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,170
That's so good.

882
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,750
I might just snowball with an ult.

883
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,150
I'll push up.

884
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,590
I'll push up.

885
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,090
I'll push up.

886
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,710
Coming with you.

887
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,230
He destroyed by us.

888
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,650
Unlucky.

889
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,070
No, no, no.

890
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,310
No rez.

891
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:11,630
Don't rez.

892
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:11,930
Don't rez.

893
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,330
We don't need that.

894
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:12,770
We don't need that.

895
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,130
We don't need that.

896
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,570
I have Claw Bolt, but I'm waiting.

897
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,290
I'm reloading.

898
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,150
He's looking for us.

899
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,250
Okay, nevermind.

900
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,830
Strange has one.

901
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,690
Strange has one.

902
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,450
We're up one.

903
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:30,850
We're up one.

904
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,690
Okay, we're even.

905
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,070
We're even.

906
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,130
You guys need to watch out.

907
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:36,870
You guys need to walk up.

908
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,650
We're down one.

909
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:39,710
Heal Jull.

910
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,430
Heal Jull.

911
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:40,790
Heal Jull.

912
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,150
I need heal.

913
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,410
I need heal.

914
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:41,690
I need heal.

915
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:43,930
Heal me.

916
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:50,690
Heal me up.

917
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,530
Yeah, nice thing.

918
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,510
Heal Jull.

919
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,150
Heal Jull.

920
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,470
Heal Jull.

921
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,170
Push.

922
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,050
Push this.

923
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,430
Push this.

924
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:04,870
Push this.

925
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,230
There's no reason not to.

926
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,590
Lime, just push the cart.

927
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,150
Push the cart, Lime.

928
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,090
Yep.

929
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,270
Yep.

930
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:11,350
Yep.

931
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:11,450
Yep.

932
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,190
Good shit.

933
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,830
I don't know what to do.

934
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,410
Who's messaging you?

935
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,550
My niece.

936
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:17,890
Hold on.

937
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,030
They're pushing.

938
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,730
They're pushing Gomez.

939
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,150
They're pushing.

940
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,510
Oh, okay.

941
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:21,730
Okay.

942
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,150
Strange on top.

943
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,450
Strange on top.

944
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,470
He's going to look for auto-moto on top.

945
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:26,810
Behind us.

946
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:27,070
Behind us.

947
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,370
Behind us.

948
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:27,570
Okay.

949
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:27,770
Okay.

950
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,050
Behind us.

951
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:30,950
It's fine.

952
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,390
I'm hit.

953
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,330
I'm hit.

954
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:34,550
I'm hit.

955
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:34,970
That's fine.

956
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,410
You're fine.

957
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,110
You're fine.

958
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:39,450
Nice.

959
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:39,750
Nice.

960
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,090
Push up.

961
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:41,690
Okay.

962
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,350
Rez this.

963
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:42,670
Rez this.

964
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,590
Lime, rez this.

965
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:43,970
Rez this.

966
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,430
Yeah.

967
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,750
Get all of us in here.

968
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,930
I'm going to look for a pull.

969
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:50,590
It's fine.

970
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,070
I got rez.

971
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,630
Hold their namor.

972
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,030
I got no heals.

973
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,310
I'm on.

974
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,550
I'm on.

975
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,590
Holding this.

976
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:58,990
We're down.

977
00:32:59,370 --> 00:32:59,690
Nice.

978
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,010
Oh, I got the... Bro, I zipped him.

979
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,490
I zipped him.

980
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:02,690
Nice.

981
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,830
Nice.

982
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,050
Pump this guy.

983
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,010
I saw it.

984
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:08,750
Nice.

985
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,050
Nice.

986
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,210
Nice.

987
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,410
Good chase.

988
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,290
God.

989
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,330
Good.

990
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,330
We got a lot of time.

991
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,090
Yeah.

992
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:13,490
See?

993
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,050
Look at that.

994
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,010
Easy.

995
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,750
It's so easy now.

996
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,550
Look at that.

997
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,330
That was super duper easy.

998
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,770
Look at that.

999
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,510
Real good rally.

1000
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,150
Really good.

1001
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,110
I'm Luna Snow.

1002
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,850
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

1003
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,950
Yeah, you guys better keep banning my Star Lord.

1004
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,250
Let me play the more broken character.

1005
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,510
Well, like, times three.

1006
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,510
I fucking hate this character.

1007
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,810
I think they might start off with Namor here.

1008
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:44,910
Now that...

1009
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,490
That's fine.

1010
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,810
Yeah.

1011
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,350
I'm surprised they didn't have Namor off the rip to, like, deal with, you know...

1012
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,390
I think they... I mean, it worked last game for them.

1013
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,050
Like, their current... the last lineup.

1014
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,730
So they're like, oh, this is the lineup that will disrupt them.

1015
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,030
Okay, my niece is still messaging me.

1016
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,410
They did what we did.

1017
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,330
They were trying to brute force.

1018
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,250
Yeah, yeah.

1019
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,550
That's why, like, I'm saying we have to be proactive with swaps.

1020
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,830
Coney, she's five.

1021
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,550
The way you were presenting it, I thought, like, some horrible aversion.

1022
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,670
Yeah, I was like, my niece is messaging me.

1023
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,450
Like, I'm at work.

1024
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,290
She's stuck under the cupboard or something.

1025
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,990
Like, her house is collapsed on her.

1026
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,790
No, she messaged me here and there and she gets mad if I switch back.

1027
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,490
What's your favorite spots for Namor here?

1028
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,910
I don't know.

1029
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,130
You can hold in the top right room.

1030
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,950
You can flank onto that bridge right there.

1031
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,490
But that's only if you have opportunities to.

1032
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,450
You can play on this side, too.

1033
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,770
I think that's a little bit too close.

1034
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,470
I'm just holding them back.

1035
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,210
This door's low.

1036
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,790
Yeah, nice.

1037
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,290
Good job.

1038
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,770
Strange jumped up.

1039
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,590
They jumped up.

1040
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,330
Strange jumped up here.

1041
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,590
I've got no heals left.

1042
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,390
It's fine.

1043
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm keeping everybody up as much as I can.

1044
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,770
I'm dropping down.

1045
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,250
Yeah, me too.

1046
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,150
Alright, so you're supposed to drop down.

1047
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,150
Oh, I got helled.

1048
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,490
So they're doing secure now.

1049
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,610
Oh, gosh.

1050
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:22,930
We can't see you.

1051
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,470
We can't see you.

1052
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,050
We can't see you.

1053
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,410
I know.

1054
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:24,590
I know.

1055
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,770
I'm forced to go.

1056
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,230
I'm forced to go and he's body blocking me.

1057
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,370
We either die or back up.

1058
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,950
You guys can die.

1059
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,510
Just die.

1060
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,490
Yeah, just die.

1061
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:36,970
Just die again.

1062
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,850
Die so we get another touch.

1063
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,010
Die so we get another touch.

1064
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,370
Nice.

1065
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,290
Just watch out for the hella.

1066
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,730
Do we want TP or no?

1067
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,550
Uh, no.

1068
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,270
No, no, no.

1069
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,910
We all make it.

1070
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,450
We all make it.

1071
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,750
Just wait until all of us are here.

1072
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,770
I'll put it on Kona.

1073
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,950
I'm putting a snowflake on Kona.

1074
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,310
We have time to rush.

1075
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,990
We have time to rush.

1076
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,050
I think we can IE.

1077
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,930
Uh, Shoto got picked.

1078
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,790
I got picked so far.

1079
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,210
They lost one, too.

1080
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,970
It's fine.

1081
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:09,750
They're rezzing.

1082
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,450
Oh, the Namoor.

1083
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,170
Namoor's behind us.

1084
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:13,930
Namoor's here, right?

1085
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,470
Namoor's here.

1086
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:14,650
I'm waiting.

1087
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,770
I have Claw waiting.

1088
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,530
There's a Namoor.

1089
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:21,970
That's one.

1090
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:22,650
Namoor one.

1091
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:22,890
Namoor one.

1092
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:25,790
We're swirled.

1093
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,050
Oh, no, we don't.

1094
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:27,850
Only rez.

1095
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,730
Yeah, only rez.

1096
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,370
You might have to use it.

1097
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,510
I'm down.

1098
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,690
No, don't use it.

1099
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,410
Oh, don't use it.

1100
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,110
Oh, wait, actually, use this, too.

1101
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1102
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,070
Oh, my God, I see you.

1103
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:35,730
Use it.

1104
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:35,930
Use it.

1105
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,250
Oh, they got point.

1106
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,030
They got point.

1107
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,390
At least we're all here.

1108
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,930
Except for Kona.

1109
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,810
Oh, yeah, by the way, I think we swap the Adam just for defense since we need to use it for sustain.

1110
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,410
Yeah, okay.

1111
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,670
They have triple support.

1112
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,630
Yeah.

1113
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,490
You want Mantis?

1114
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,550
No, no, no.

1115
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,330
Or Cloak and Dagger.

1116
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,230
Cloak or Dagger.

1117
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:01,630
Cloak or Dagger.

1118
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,090
Either one.

1119
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,050
Thorbine!

1120
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,470
Thorbine!

1121
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:04,990
Thorbine!

1122
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,590
I don't have freeze.

1123
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,230
I don't have freeze.

1124
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,920
Oh, we're giving a lot of space.

1125
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,260
Yeah, yeah, we gotta push up.

1126
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,880
We gotta push up a bit.

1127
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,480
I'm back.

1128
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:16,880
Strange Job I.

1129
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,720
Yeah, Strange Job I.

1130
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,460
We're giving a lot of space again.

1131
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,500
Yeah, we're gonna have to.

1132
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,680
Help for Kona.

1133
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,200
Help Kona.

1134
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,060
Kona's by himself.

1135
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,860
Kona's by himself.

1136
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,500
Kona's by himself.

1137
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,160
Oh, my God.

1138
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,320
It's alright, Kona.

1139
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,240
You can back up.

1140
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
We can give space, Kona.

1141
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,120
Okay.

1142
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Oh, my God.

1143
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,580
They're just looking for me in here.

1144
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,220
Okay, fine.

1145
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,660
That's okay.

1146
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,080
That's okay.

1147
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,880
You're still alive.

1148
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,400
You're still alive.

1149
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:46,780
Nice.

1150
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:46,860
Nice.

1151
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,140
Good heal.

1152
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,180
Oh, my God.

1153
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,280
When I die, I'll switch.

1154
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,800
I'm ulting this.

1155
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,760
Oh, I'm dead.

1156
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,340
Hello, one.

1157
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,380
Three, two, one.

1158
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:07,840
Switching.

1159
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,000
Nice.

1160
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,280
They used support.

1161
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,620
Nice.

1162
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,740
He's one.

1163
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,040
He's one.

1164
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,320
He's one.

1165
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,600
Nice.

1166
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,780
Fuck me.

1167
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,100
Okay.

1168
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,560
Yeah, I'm trying to get on.

1169
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,340
I'm on it, but yeah.

1170
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,160
No.

1171
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,780
It's tough.

1172
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,180
It's tough.

1173
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,520
It's tough.

1174
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:26,860
I know.

1175
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:28,700
Alright.

1176
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,040
Play around corners.

1177
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,980
Don't do anything rushed.

1178
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,020
We just hold space.

1179
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,060
We don't have to go for plays.

1180
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:33,980
Okay.

1181
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,100
I'm being chased by Thor.

1182
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,780
Never mind.

1183
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,740
The hell is fueling it right now?

1184
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,540
We just play around where his vision is.

1185
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,540
Poke him out.

1186
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,380
We don't have to do anything.

1187
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,420
We just ult rotate.

1188
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,720
Also, someone's top right.

1189
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
It's okay if I do Mantis.

1190
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm more comfortable on him.

1191
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,820
Our heals will be lacking.

1192
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,980
Oh, yeah.

1193
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,000
We can't.

1194
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,960
We have to have sustainability.

1195
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,700
Bro, this Thor keeps trying to push onto me.

1196
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,460
Yeah.

1197
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,680
Drop down again.

1198
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,080
Drop down again.

1199
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:02,540
Heal me.

1200
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,100
Heal me.

1201
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:03,380
Heal me.

1202
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,680
Heal me.

1203
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Heal me.

1204
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,000
Heal me.

1205
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,220
I'm trying.

1206
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm trying.

1207
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm trying.

1208
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,620
Thank you.

1209
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,980
I need heals here.

1210
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,460
I need heals.

1211
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,120
We lost.

1212
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,400
Yeah.

1213
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,540
We lost both supports.

1214
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,160
We have no supports.

1215
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,880
We have no supports.

1216
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,300
I'm coming back right now and I'll have ult soon.

1217
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,030
I have ult here.

1218
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:35,870
We can burn that.

1219
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,350
I'm burning that.

1220
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,710
I'm using this for Coney.

1221
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,350
They killed both of us.

1222
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,190
Yeah, they killed both of us shooting at them.

1223
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,430
I'm putting up a TP on the right side.

1224
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,970
Is that even worth it?

1225
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:45,830
Or do I just walk?

1226
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,350
I can just walk.

1227
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,470
Walk.

1228
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,810
Two.

1229
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,770
One.

1230
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,090
Dude, this hell is fucking hard.

1231
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,270
Fucking me up, man.

1232
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,230
Yeah, I can't even stay alive.

1233
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,410
I didn't even ult.

1234
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,370
I tried to ult, but...

1235
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:58,650
Fuck.

1236
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,070
I don't know if we should stay Bucky here.

1237
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,850
It's fun doing it here.

1238
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,390
What do you want me on, though?

1239
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,470
I don't know.

1240
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,090
I just...

1241
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,630
Bro, Hella has too much space.

1242
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,810
We can go Hella.

1243
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,530
We can do it back, but...

1244
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,150
Bucky's better.

1245
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,150
Hella's just getting a pick, and then they snowball us.

1246
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,950
I don't play Hella, though.

1247
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,910
I fucking hate Hella.

1248
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,590
Like, the Hella literally is...

1249
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,550
The Hella Neymar flanks us, and we have nothing to do about it.

1250
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,250
Do you want a cheese?

1251
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,210
Do you want a cheese a little bit?

1252
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,770
So, you can hold in the inside room with this comp.

1253
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,210
Please run a triple support, Relyne.

1254
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,210
Okay.

1255
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,230
I'll tell you guys what to do.

1256
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,750
I'll tell you guys.

1257
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,130
Oh, do you want me back?

1258
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:49,850
Do you want me back on Cloak and Dagger?

1259
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,090
Because we're on defense.

1260
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:52,350
Uh, no, no.

1261
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,090
We have Loki.

1262
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,190
No, I'm on Loki now.

1263
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,150
Wait, okay, we'll do Luna.

1264
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:56,630
I keep this, right?

1265
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,930
We'll stay Luna here.

1266
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,630
We need triple support.

1267
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,090
We hold in the inside room for the entirety, okay?

1268
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,230
I'm gonna show you which room.

1269
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,610
Give a brief exclamation.

1270
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,570
So, we're gonna hold in this room, okay?

1271
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,790
Okay.

1272
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,170
If they try to take off angles on the side, we call it out.

1273
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,290
Like, if someone's trying to go around, or if someone's above.

1274
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,250
They will take a lot of angles on us, but with our comp, we can hold inside for a very long time.

1275
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,550
Do not go past this corner, okay?

1276
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,390
Don't leave this door.

1277
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:27,930
Got it.

1278
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,170
Yeah.

1279
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,050
Well, still to do it to contest, because you can.

1280
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:31,790
Yeah.

1281
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,370
Just try not to...

1282
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:34,410
I hear you.

1283
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,250
Yeah.

1284
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,430
Usually we have this with Magneto, but they banned it, so...

1285
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,770
Oh, hold them.

1286
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,250
Hold them in.

1287
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,130
Nice.

1288
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,530
Moira's up on the top left.

1289
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,430
Yeah, that's fine.

1290
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:49,930
That's fine.

1291
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:50,990
We stay here.

1292
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,530
We stay here.

1293
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,470
We get the contest here.

1294
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,090
We just bunker.

1295
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,030
We just bunker here.

1296
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,950
I'm just standing here to contest.

1297
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,290
Just get back.

1298
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,050
Just be careful of the flank.

1299
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,870
Someone has to be careful of the flankers.

1300
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,110
We should... None of us should be able to die here.

1301
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:05,670
Look at Thor.

1302
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,790
Frozen.

1303
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,270
Nice.

1304
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,570
They got... Hello, Flanky.

1305
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,150
Hello, Flanky.

1306
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:11,430
Behind.

1307
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:11,710
Behind.

1308
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:11,870
Behind.

1309
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,030
Behind.

1310
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:12,910
It's fine.

1311
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,170
It's fine.

1312
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,570
I got Hela.

1313
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:13,970
I got Hela.

1314
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,310
I got Hela.

1315
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:14,710
I got Hela.

1316
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,330
Keep contesting.

1317
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:15,890
Keep contesting.

1318
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,450
Keep contesting.

1319
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,530
I'm back on the point.

1320
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,490
We let it pass.

1321
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,650
Oh my god.

1322
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,590
We let it pass.

1323
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,360
I can't sustain there.

1324
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,940
Yeah, we let it pass.

1325
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,720
Good kill.

1326
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,120
Just die if you can.

1327
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,980
Die if you can if you're still fighting.

1328
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,640
No.

1329
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,540
No, huge support ult advantage.

1330
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,900
Me and Coney just call it.

1331
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,980
We can combo with our ults.

1332
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,020
Or...

1333
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,920
Sherine, copy me.

1334
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,660
Yeah.

1335
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,280
Ults went close.

1336
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,300
They're pushing up.

1337
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,860
They're pushing up.

1338
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,220
Ults close.

1339
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,080
Is it Thor?

1340
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,640
Hela's right there.

1341
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,860
I'm gonna ult on first, okay?

1342
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,320
I pulled the ult.

1343
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,040
Okay.

1344
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,560
I'm coming.

1345
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:07,680
I'm here.

1346
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,680
I'm healing.

1347
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,320
I'm just gonna heal.

1348
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,400
We gotta play around Coney.

1349
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,800
I gotta play around Coney.

1350
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,240
I'm back up.

1351
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,080
We're down all our supports.

1352
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,680
Do I actually have... I have Hella.

1353
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,840
But Hella is so fucking... I hate it.

1354
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,600
I'll do it.

1355
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,120
You can go to Bucky now.

1356
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,520
Or...

1357
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,760
I think you might...

1358
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,980
I definitely need to warm up after this.

1359
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,560
They're pushing me.

1360
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,970
We got a pick, so we should push up here.

1361
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:51,710
We're up one.

1362
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:52,550
I'm pushing up.

1363
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:52,950
I have ult.

1364
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:53,590
I have ult.

1365
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,530
Just use things.

1366
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:56,630
You can.

1367
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,540
Nice, nice, nice.

1368
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,180
I got him.

1369
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
What up?

1370
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,700
Oh, okay.

1371
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,420
Get the Luna, Luna, Luna.

1372
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,160
Huge ult.

1373
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,820
Good shit.

1374
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,060
Cloak down.

1375
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:21,900
Hella down.

1376
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,620
Good shit.

1377
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,100
Good ult.

1378
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:23,820
Great ult.

1379
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,600
Yeah, I think Hella was a good swap.

1380
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,360
You diffed your Hella.

1381
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,640
You diffed your Hella and you diffed your other DPS.

1382
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:33,760
Wow.

1383
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,320
Unlucky.

1384
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,540
Lucky, lucky.

1385
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,320
Run the ship.

1386
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,220
Why not?

1387
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,260
Actually, we ban the Sue.

1388
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,440
Yeah.

1389
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,700
Usually the right support line would be Loki Luna.

1390
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,740
That's gonna be tough.

1391
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,900
Even if we just first ban Hella next game, just leave Groot.

1392
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,260
Nope.

1393
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,000
Do you want me on Adam or something else?

1394
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,020
I think for now, we do need a second support ult.

1395
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,440
Should I just go Loki then?

1396
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,180
That's if you want.

1397
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,520
We could run... I could put Lime on Luna and I could run Loki.

1398
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,440
But it is a bit dangerous.

1399
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,400
I don't know.

1400
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,240
I think you're a much stronger Luna than I am.

1401
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,880
Yeah, it's a bit dangerous.

1402
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,360
It's up to you, Shota.

1403
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,120
You can do a Loki, you can do a Namor here.

1404
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,160
You have to get picks though.

1405
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,040
Okay, I'll do it.

1406
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,320
Okay, then you can run Adam.

1407
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,880
Okay, go back to Adam.

1408
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,380
I'm gonna drop the dopest album anytime mine has ever hurt.

1409
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,960
On top?

1410
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,340
Anymore?

1411
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,780
Yeah, I'm...

1412
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,800
Alright, yep.

1413
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,520
No bubble.

1414
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,620
I'm gonna do what I'm trying.

1415
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,840
You have to put your bubble up.

1416
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,240
I go to someone.

1417
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,260
They're gonna look for me, by the way.

1418
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,560
What's up top, Bianna?

1419
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,920
I'm getting poked.

1420
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,440
Yeah, I'm getting beaten up by the Lord up here.

1421
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,960
Lord is frozen.

1422
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,260
Yeah, door through.

1423
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,060
We can't kill you guys, watch out.

1424
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,680
Okay, now we can.

1425
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,540
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

1426
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,060
Namor's still up here.

1427
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,820
I need to take off angles.

1428
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,520
Hell is walking up.

1429
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,840
Namor is getting free picks.

1430
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,780
Namor is getting...

1431
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,060
Go, go.

1432
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,460
Yeah, go Namor.

1433
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,660
Okay.

1434
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,240
I almost have ult though.

1435
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,520
It's fine, it's fine.

1436
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,420
We need to swap.

1437
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,020
We can't...

1438
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,480
We need to be proactive with swaps.

1439
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:55,600
Yeah.

1440
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:57,700
Okay, I'm going.

1441
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,660
I'm on Namor now.

1442
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,780
There's our helicant.

1443
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,860
Namor, I'm on, I'm on.

1444
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:03,740
I'm behind.

1445
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,060
I can't see.

1446
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,760
I'm healing our tanks.

1447
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,460
I'm healing our tanks.

1448
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:06,800
I'm healing our tanks.

1449
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,160
Right here, right here.

1450
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:07,820
On top, on top.

1451
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,300
Behind us.

1452
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,140
Any heal behind us.

1453
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
Oh, they doubled?

1454
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,640
They doubled, yeah.

1455
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,840
They doubled, that's perfect.

1456
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,900
I need a snowflake behind me.

1457
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,680
I'm trying to keep coney up right now.

1458
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,060
No worries.

1459
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,080
If you peek me, I can give you a snowflake.

1460
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:29,960
Are you peeking me right now?

1461
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:30,620
I'm here.

1462
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,400
Okay, I got you.

1463
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,080
Hello, one.

1464
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,020
He's going to buy.

1465
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,480
I got a big pick.

1466
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,420
We got two picks.

1467
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,000
We got two picks.

1468
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,820
Push up, push up, push up.

1469
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,780
Push up, push up.

1470
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,620
We got two picks.

1471
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,820
Get the Namor that's coming from the sky.

1472
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,800
I got Namor.

1473
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,200
I'm dead.

1474
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,040
Get the Thor, get the Thor if you can.

1475
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,620
Get the Thor.

1476
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,600
Dash in one, dash up.

1477
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,380
Yep, Thor's dead.

1478
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,060
I'm on a point.

1479
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,880
Oh no, he's not, he's not.

1480
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,340
I'm going to keep the snowflake on Gomez.

1481
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,200
Coming back.

1482
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,100
I'm going to push cart, I'm going to push cart.

1483
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,740
You're going to have one more, you might have a contest here.

1484
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,180
I think he has Agamotto though.

1485
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,680
I ult Agamotto, I ult Agamotto.

1486
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,660
They're going to use everything for the last push.

1487
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,640
Yep.

1488
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,200
Off angle.

1489
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,460
Still on off angle.

1490
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,800
Namor no bubble, Namor no bubble.

1491
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,320
Namor one.

1492
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,720
Careful on top, Agamotto.

1493
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,320
Oh god, what?

1494
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,340
I pressed Q.

1495
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:36,900
What?

1496
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,460
Okay, it's fine.

1497
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,100
Still linked it.

1498
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,240
Yeah, that's good, still linked.

1499
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,680
That was huge.

1500
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Oh my god.

1501
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,960
Huge Agamotto, huge Agamotto.

1502
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,880
Nice, good shit, good shit.

1503
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,200
Oh my god.

1504
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,220
Fuck this Thor.

1505
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,470
He's the fucking Sorcerer.

1506
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,800
Oh my god.

1507
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,540
He's the Sorcerer of the big wave.

1508
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,580
Oh my god.

1509
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,840
The Sorcerer Supreme.

1510
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,120
Oh my god.

1511
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,240
Holy shit, dude.

1512
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,760
Oh my god.

1513
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,200
My fucking...

1514
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,500
Dude.

1515
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,920
Thank god you still linked us live.

1516
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,420
My Q went, the aura went off.

1517
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,420
But like, the ping, because I have a higher ping, so the ping didn't catch up with it.

1518
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,860
I was like, are you fucking serious?

1519
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,040
I saw that you weren't thinking, I was like, okay, solve on time.

1520
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,080
The master of the mystic arts.

1521
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,020
Holy shit, man.

1522
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,520
Oh my god.

1523
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,020
Oh.

1524
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,160
Can I go home?

1525
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,220
My game is super chugging, I'm gonna restart my game real quick.

1526
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,780
Okay, okay.

1527
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,300
So I don't die there.

1528
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,460
Dude, that strange ult was unbelievable, good shit.

1529
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,240
Oh, thanks.

1530
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, good job.

1531
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,680
That was Ash, that was so fucking clutch.

1532
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,080
Training paid off.

1533
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:45,640
It did.

1534
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,520
This is all...

1535
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,540
So this is back to three.

1536
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,360
Yeah, this is three, so we have one more game.

1537
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah, we should keep... your strange is way better than mine.

1538
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,560
Like, we should just keep you on that or mag if we get it.

1539
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,920
And I'll just stay mag or thing.

1540
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:58,960
I'm done.

1541
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,000
Do we keep the ban line, or...

1542
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,240
Yeah, we keep the ban line.

1543
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:03,540
Okay.

1544
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,900
I don't think we need to change it up at all.

1545
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,200
Banning Sue, sorry?

1546
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,920
Uh, yeah.

1547
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,100
Banning Sue so Battle can have a free ult.

1548
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,720
Super reliant on the shields.

1549
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,020
Yeah, I'm gonna keep the snowflake on you then, Gomez, when you're on Hella.

1550
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,480
I think the Hella swap was a good call there.

1551
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,740
It was.

1552
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,780
Ah, but I don't like...

1553
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,280
Yeah, Mr. Fucking Stubborn Ass.

1554
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,540
I'm not good at it, though.

1555
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,000
I'm not good at it.

1556
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,740
Me, passively aggressive, being like, maybe Bucky's not the...

1557
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,400
I just don't... I don't like the... I don't like to play Hella.

1558
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,240
That's always Rye that's playing it.

1559
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,000
I want to blame it on other stuff, but it's mainly my sense.

1560
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,100
My sense is way too high to be playing Hella.

1561
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,180
Oh my god, I'm... Guys, I'm yelling at myself.

1562
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,240
I am... I'm fucking... I'm making so many mistakes.

1563
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
I'm so nervous.

1564
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh, I'm making a lot of mistakes.

1565
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:16,120
I can't believe that straight... Like, my fucking aura went off, too, and like, I was so surprised.

1566
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,720
I was like...

1567
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,220
I react... I felt like I reacted perfectly, too.

1568
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:23,880
Yeah.

1569
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,780
I was like, why did... Why did it... That's strange.

1570
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,500
I was like, what?

1571
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,520
I was so surprised.

1572
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,940
I was like, why didn't my Q go off?

1573
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,900
The aura... The... It gave me the... It gave me the, like, the visuals for it.

1574
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,440
Alright.

1575
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,140
I think I just got pinged if tired there, because, like, it gave me the visual.

1576
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,840
Because I always... I always, like, react to that shit.

1577
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,650
Wait, what?

1578
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,210
I just joined it.

1579
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:55,890
I don't think he invited me.

1580
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,970
I'm going to invite you guys.

1581
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:57,670
Hold on.

1582
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:58,670
Thank you.

1583
00:51:59,250 --> 00:51:59,950
Thank you.

1584
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,700
So, it's one more game.

1585
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,380
You have to move me.

1586
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,220
I can't move.

1587
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:14,660
Weird.

1588
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,420
Yeah.

1589
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,900
You have to move me.

1590
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,780
I can't move it.

1591
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,600
Yeah, I can't move myself.

1592
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,290
Okay.

1593
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,090
Okay.

1594
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,470
It's Domination.

1595
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,550
I'll Groot on this map.

1596
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,570
Yeah, we definitely need to ban him.

1597
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,450
Yeah, Groot is always gone here.

1598
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,170
Yeah.

1599
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,810
We still want Thing here, right?

1600
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,290
Yeah.

1601
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:50,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1602
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:52,530
And...

1603
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,290
I think in Domination, flankers are, like, much more...

1604
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,890
Yeah, so that... I'll just put the snowflake on Gomez to deal with the flankers.

1605
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,430
Yep.

1606
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,250
Because of that...

1607
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,730
So, they want Namor here, but I don't know if Hela is, like, ideal in this situation.

1608
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,970
But, I mean, it's still scary, but...

1609
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:12,830
Let's see what they play.

1610
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:13,490
If they play Hela...

1611
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:13,530
It's Hela.

1612
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,030
Okay.

1613
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,370
If they play Hela, then we should...

1614
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,590
We're playing a different meta at the moment.

1615
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:23,190
So, the meta that's also something that's played a shit ton is the Hela-Namor.

1616
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,390
And you just have, like, an off-angle battle all the time.

1617
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,030
So, usually, you would be, kind of, one-shotting them.

1618
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:33,050
I'd be marking their Hela and marking whatever tank is in the front line.

1619
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,230
Then, we have our front line, who's basically unkillable.

1620
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,030
Since Coney takes zero damage on the thing.

1621
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:45,010
Then, you have Battle doing his playmaker stuff in the mid-fights.

1622
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,690
Because, usually, we'd be running...

1623
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,090
Normal teams would be running Luna and Loki.

1624
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,070
But, I'm glad we picked up the Adam-Luna.

1625
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,210
Because that works well, too.

1626
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,090
That works wonders.

1627
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,890
The Thor is not that difficult to counter, too.

1628
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,990
Because I literally just freeze him every time I see him.

1629
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:06,730
Oh, no.

1630
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:06,970
Yeah.

1631
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:07,830
He's not...

1632
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,510
He's not that oppressive for us.

1633
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,630
It's literally just the Hela.

1634
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,010
That's fucking us up at the moment.

1635
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,440
Okay, we're ready.

1636
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:18,900
Are you ready?

1637
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:20,900
Yeah.

1638
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,720
Ready, yep.

1639
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,440
Yep.

1640
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,220
Good to go.

1641
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:31,410
Okay.

1642
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,360
So, we still keep things safe and just take the Strange, right?

1643
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,260
Yep.

1644
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,040
If they don't ban my Star-Lord, then yippee.

1645
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,400
They don't ban the Star-Lord.

1646
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,280
I see a world where they try and ban both of Battle's tanks or something like that.

1647
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,960
But, I don't know if that's a free thing.

1648
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,220
I was just thinking about that.

1649
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:58,840
Yeah.

1650
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,640
If they do...

1651
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,100
Wait, what do you play?

1652
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,180
Groot is his next best one.

1653
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,900
And we're banning Groot.

1654
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,180
Oh, shit.

1655
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,680
If we do that, we can put Battle on a support.

1656
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:15,880
Oh, God.

1657
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,760
And then we run just one, one, two, three.

1658
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,460
We'll see how it goes.

1659
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,100
I think so, a tank, two DPS, three support.

1660
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,480
If that happens, because I think I believe in your Star-Lord.

1661
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:31,840
Yeah.

1662
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,620
As long as we heavy pocket Gomez, if he's on Star-Lord, then it'll be fine.

1663
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:39,280
Because his Star-Lord can just destroy the DPS.

1664
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:40,780
Yep.

1665
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,640
Fun.

1666
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,600
And they're getting rid of their own Strange and Mag too, so they won't have a Strange.

1667
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,520
Yeah, so I don't think they would do that.

1668
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:55,860
Yeah.

1669
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:05,140
So, do you still, do we want to try and do triple tank, triple support?

1670
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,780
Or are we going for damage still?

1671
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,920
Like me on Amor and Gomez on Bucky?

1672
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,540
Probably keep the same line right now.

1673
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,480
If you want.

1674
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,800
I mean, we can try banning out Hala if you want.

1675
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,560
You want to try that?

1676
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,620
Not if it lets Groot through.

1677
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,720
Just ban Groot, ban Groot.

1678
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,840
Yeah, I'm banning Groot.

1679
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,280
Banning Groot.

1680
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,020
Groot is much more oppressive to our tanks than Hala.

1681
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,100
Hala is oppressive to our support line.

1682
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:38,780
Yeah, the thing is I'd rather deal with that because Groot separating our healing is just annoying as fuck.

1683
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,120
Yep.

1684
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,580
And then protect the, yeah, they're running Hala, so you just try to Hala diff them.

1685
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,080
Protect the thing.

1686
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,880
You know, I could run Wolf.

1687
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,240
Could, but it's going to be more difficult.

1688
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,760
Yeah, it's not going to make things more difficult.

1689
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,280
It's not going to make it more difficult, unless you think it's a high-risk, high-reward.

1690
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,680
It is a high-risk, high-reward.

1691
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,360
Oh, no, they're going to run Thor, never mind.

1692
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,320
Banning Sue.

1693
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:06,680
Yeah, banning Sue.

1694
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,240
Because if they run...

1695
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,840
They're running Thor, Loki, Hala for the rez.

1696
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:16,400
Yep.

1697
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,280
Oh my gosh, but oh, we got...

1698
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,320
Even after that?

1699
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,060
Fuck, man.

1700
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,940
I'm not judging.

1701
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,560
At the game-winning fucking eye, they still want to get rid of Mag instead.

1702
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,940
Just Coney, you do too much on things.

1703
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,620
That's the thing.

1704
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,540
Okay.

1705
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,360
I don't know, after that Eye of Agamotto last game, that's...

1706
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,460
I'd be banning Strange.

1707
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,200
Yeah, but you may have got shit ton of space.

1708
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,200
You existing is just crazy.

1709
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:45,880
Yeah.

1710
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,740
Metal flew up, and then did the thing.

1711
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,480
I did fly up.

1712
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,080
Woosh!

1713
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,700
Oh, you did the fly thing.

1714
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,080
You fly up and they ignore you?

1715
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,360
Yeah, remember the first game when you just walk up to them?

1716
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,220
I remember.

1717
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,620
Just casually scroll up.

1718
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:03,960
Hello.

1719
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,980
Yeah, and then...

1720
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,760
I'm on your team now.

1721
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,500
Yeah, now you fly up.

1722
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,160
Look at that.

1723
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,800
Character building.

1724
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,700
Okay, so Coney, you don't have the snowflake, okay?

1725
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,140
So...

1726
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,320
I'm putting the snowflake on Gomez.

1727
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,480
The moment Gomez kill flankers, or kill their DPS, I'll swap the snowflake back to you.

1728
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:29,820
Okay.

1729
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,580
Are you all ready?

1730
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:42,800
You all good?

1731
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,260
Yeah.

1732
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,620
I'm good, I'm good.

1733
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,340
I'm frazzled.

1734
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,320
They portal immediately.

1735
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:48,940
Portal up.

1736
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,680
High ground.

1737
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,760
Don't take left side.

1738
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,400
Take all the space on the right.

1739
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,800
That's a bad TP.

1740
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,130
I can't really do anything with this.

1741
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:02,590
Left side.

1742
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,390
Hello, left side.

1743
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:03,710
Hello.

1744
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:04,250
Hello there.

1745
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:05,950
Hello and Namor.

1746
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,310
We need a couple of points.

1747
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,310
Yeah, I'm on the point right now.

1748
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:14,570
Hello in the center.

1749
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,510
He's on the left side too.

1750
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,970
They're slowly getting on point.

1751
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:20,930
Yeah, Namor low.

1752
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,750
Namor's low.

1753
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:22,150
Oh.

1754
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,210
Alright, they pop shift.

1755
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:23,790
Okay.

1756
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:25,610
Waiting for you to get the deal.

1757
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:26,710
Okay, they're spread out.

1758
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,030
Oh, oh.

1759
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,710
We both burrowed.

1760
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:29,890
No one's in here.

1761
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:30,530
What the fuck?

1762
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:33,790
They're low.

1763
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:35,890
Strange low.

1764
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,850
Can't finish it though.

1765
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:37,450
Don't want to die.

1766
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,150
Okay.

1767
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,670
Namor's low in front of me.

1768
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:42,730
Yeah.

1769
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,690
Strange is so low.

1770
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:46,150
Oh no, they're all in there.

1771
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:46,370
Okay.

1772
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,330
Yeah, they're all like bunched up in there.

1773
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,230
Yeah, it's weird.

1774
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,230
They're like in the back though.

1775
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,190
This is such a weird position to play.

1776
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,850
Oh, they're going to push me.

1777
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:56,390
Yeah, I need help.

1778
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:56,910
I need help on the right.

1779
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,590
On right, on right, on right, on right.

1780
00:59:58,590 --> 00:59:59,110
I got you.

1781
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:01,850
I'm with you, I'm with you.

1782
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:02,850
All doors are on here too.

1783
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:04,950
Guys, point, point, point, point, point.

1784
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,130
You're all, you're all getting on point.

1785
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:06,990
You're all getting on point.

1786
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,030
I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point.

1787
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,450
I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point.

1788
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,490
But I need heals.

1789
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,330
Strange.

1790
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:11,650
Okay.

1791
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:12,470
Strange one.

1792
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:13,310
All dead.

1793
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:15,850
That sucks.

1794
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,590
I got all here.

1795
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,570
Fight on point if you have to.

1796
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,170
Yeah, if I say I need help, just support support me.

1797
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,230
I have ult for this.

1798
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,550
Three, two, one.

1799
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:30,810
Nice.

1800
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,730
Nice, good stall, good stall.

1801
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,110
Keep stalling, keep stalling.

1802
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,410
Just keep stalling, just keep stalling.

1803
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:38,690
Yeah, just keep stalling.

1804
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,910
They found me, they found me.

1805
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,090
No, it's fine though, it's fine.

1806
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:41,590
They found me, they found me.

1807
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,150
Oh my god, bro.

1808
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,230
I tried to kill.

1809
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,730
Yeah, he was following you the whole time.

1810
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:47,750
Yeah.

1811
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,090
Alright.

1812
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,090
It's fine, 80%.

1813
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,130
Can you portal on?

1814
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,130
Can you portal our side?

1815
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,010
Yeah, we can portal, portal, portal.

1816
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,430
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,230
Same place they did?

1818
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:57,930
Yup.

1819
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,450
Yeah, high ground, high ground.

1820
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,330
I don't know how much I'm doing, should I switch?

1821
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,230
That's fine, keep your, keep your slow bond.

1822
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:06,330
Okay.

1823
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,290
They should have cloak ult here.

1824
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,690
Or like, low key ult.

1825
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,370
Watch our high, watch our high, watch our high.

1826
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,910
Yeah.

1827
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,250
Nice, nice, nice.

1828
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,390
He's dead.

1829
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:19,650
Good shit.

1830
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,150
Going down, capping.

1831
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:23,830
Neymar down here, Hurt.

1832
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,090
I have to solo him.

1833
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,270
Uh, Neymar.

1834
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,690
I didn't see him.

1835
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,650
Neymar dead, Neymar dead.

1836
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:31,150
You only have, you only have low, uh, Adamo.

1837
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,750
I got low key, low key dead, low key dead.

1838
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:33,110
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1839
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:33,730
Huge, huge pit.

1840
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:35,610
I did not heal the humanity, hello.

1841
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:36,470
Yeah, we got point, we got point.

1842
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,890
Pushing up on the right, chasing.

1843
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:39,910
Just get point, save point.

1844
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:41,470
We're good.

1845
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:42,670
Going back.

1846
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,190
Nice, good job.

1847
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:44,610
Nice, nice, nice.

1848
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:45,250
Yeah!

1849
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,030
Oh, nice, good pick, good pick, yeah.

1850
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,030
Oh my god, we did really well there with the retake.

1851
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:49,490
Good job.

1852
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,150
Nice, nice.

1853
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,530
Just build ult charge.

1854
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,050
I don't know if they're gonna touch, yeah.

1855
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,210
They can't.

1856
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:54,690
They can't, they can't.

1857
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,250
I don't think they can.

1858
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:55,970
No.

1859
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:56,710
Good shit!

1860
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,710
Nice, nice, nice.

1861
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:58,250
Good shit, good shit.

1862
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:03,790
Okay, we can't be as aggressive with this next one.

1863
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,370
I think we, because we don't have anything close to an ult right now.

1864
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,390
Yeah, they used, they used, they used strange, hella.

1865
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:11,830
Did they use Neymar ult?

1866
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,170
Yes, I used Neymar ult to kill Loki.

1867
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,470
So they'll still, so they'll have Loki ult and Thor ult then.

1868
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,090
Did they just use Loki ult at the end and he died?

1869
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:19,310
Did they?

1870
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,990
Yeah, they did.

1871
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:22,670
They don't, they don't have Loki ult.

1872
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,050
Okay, so the only ult they'll have is Thor and Cloak.

1873
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,310
So they have Thor and Cloak, cool, okay.

1874
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:28,530
Yeah, yeah.

1875
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:29,690
Okay, so.

1876
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,610
Thor's gonna, Thor's gonna be aggressive trying to get our backline.

1877
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:33,130
Yeah, yeah.

1878
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,490
So guys, when, when Gomez says help me, I'll, the supports will turn around.

1879
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,770
Tanks just keep fighting.

1880
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:38,570
Okay, I'll, I'll stay forward.

1881
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:38,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1882
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:39,530
Yeah.

1883
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,910
Yeah, we left point too many times for that.

1884
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,290
It's fine, it's fine.

1885
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:55,910
I think most of the callouts will be for the supports, like tanks just focus on, you know.

1886
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,390
Yeah, tanks.

1887
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,690
If we call for like, we'll call for your help for tanks if needed.

1888
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,970
But if supports are calling for help, it's mostly for DPS to turn around.

1889
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,030
Yeah.

1890
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,370
Like, I'll have his back and so will the supports.

1891
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,210
Okay, that's fine, that's fine.

1892
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:10,570
They're high ground.

1893
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,430
They're left, left.

1894
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:12,430
Ooh.

1895
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,110
This is a bad, this is a weird spot.

1896
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,470
I think left, probably.

1897
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:18,410
They're more dropped.

1898
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,050
We can't, let's push, let's push.

1899
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:22,530
Left.

1900
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,070
Yeah, left.

1901
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,370
They're more one.

1902
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,630
I'm gonna be fine, but I'll be...

1903
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:31,330
Oh, Neymar could die, Neymar could die.

1904
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,050
Got it.

1905
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:32,870
Yeah, Neymar dead, Neymar dead.

1906
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,590
You guys can play around Coney's ult, play around Coney's ult.

1907
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,950
They're low, they're low.

1908
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:37,810
Oh, I got it.

1909
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,650
Huge, huge, huge.

1910
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:40,670
We have, we have...

1911
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,650
Oh my god, we lost people, yeah.

1912
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,010
Yeah.

1913
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:43,030
Yeah.

1914
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,030
I got focused by the Hella.

1915
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,250
Wait, that's their only support ult.

1916
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,130
That's their only support ult.

1917
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we're fine.

1918
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:53,690
They don't have support ult, they don't have support ult, but we don't have any ults to counter it.

1919
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:56,650
You okay?

1920
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:57,170
No, you're not.

1921
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:57,530
Yeah.

1922
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,270
No, he was trying to stagger me, but I have my rez, so I'm just gonna come over here.

1923
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:02,810
Oh, okay.

1924
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,050
They have Psylocke, Psylocke.

1925
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:06,830
They have Psylocke.

1926
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,130
I can't...

1927
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:08,530
It's a weird spot.

1928
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,110
Yeah, they have Psylocke.

1929
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,110
Got you, I got you.

1930
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,270
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1931
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,150
Yes, that's a pick.

1932
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:13,770
Alright, pushing up.

1933
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:17,230
What the fuck?

1934
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,270
Guys, guys, two picks, two picks, two picks.

1935
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:18,870
Go, go, go, go.

1936
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:19,450
Push up, push up.

1937
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:20,030
Yeah, yeah.

1938
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:20,850
Okay.

1939
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:21,750
Got you, I got you, I got you.

1940
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:21,930
Thank you.

1941
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,610
Sorry, I tried to even have a line of sight.

1942
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:25,170
Nice, nice, nice.

1943
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,370
They're getting nervous.

1944
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:30,830
Yeah, they are.

1945
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,570
That Psylocke was fumbling against me.

1946
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,370
I don't know what that was.

1947
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:36,630
They still don't have, uh, what's it called?

1948
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,670
Strange Portal 2, so they gotta fight for this.

1949
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:42,810
Nice.

1950
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,590
Make them walk in, make them walk in.

1951
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,250
Because I can't do anything at this rate.

1952
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:48,790
Oh, I can get Thor here.

1953
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:49,790
Oh my god, he's so low.

1954
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:51,330
Psylocke, Psylocke, Psylocke.

1955
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,930
Got you, got you, got you.

1956
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,250
Nice.

1957
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,810
They're fucking up, they're fucking up so hard right now.

1958
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:55,610
I have ult, I have ult.

1959
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:58,210
We can combo, we can combo.

1960
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:58,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1961
01:04:58,670 --> 01:04:59,510
I'll let you know.

1962
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,830
I'll let you keep it, keep it for the combo.

1963
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:02,850
Watch left.

1964
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:06,230
I'll try and hold, I'll hold high ground.

1965
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,010
Or try to hold high ground here.

1966
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,010
Come on.

1967
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,370
I need help on left.

1968
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:14,950
Psylocke on right.

1969
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,570
Psylocke here.

1970
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,210
Oh, got her, got her, got her.

1971
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,710
She's dead, she's dead.

1972
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:21,310
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1973
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,170
Psylocke is on me, Psylocke is on me.

1974
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:24,490
I need heal.

1975
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,950
I can't, I couldn't get to you.

1976
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,130
That's fine, that's fine.

1977
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,750
Nice.

1978
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:29,810
Nice.

1979
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,090
You guys are doing well, you guys are doing so well.

1980
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,310
Good hold, good hold.

1981
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,090
Alright, people on left here.

1982
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:34,770
We need to push them out.

1983
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:35,710
Yup.

1984
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:36,210
Alright.

1985
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,450
I'm with you.

1986
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:38,150
I'm walking back.

1987
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,010
Just know, you don't have me.

1988
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:39,970
You guys are shooting from there.

1989
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:40,530
He can't move.

1990
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,070
They're down one support, down one support right now.

1991
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:44,210
Let it go, let it go, let it go.

1992
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:46,590
Alright, good shit.

1993
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:48,550
I'm sure you're fine.

1994
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,210
I have a Snowblade on me.

1995
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:50,230
We have almost every ult.

1996
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,650
We have every ult here.

1997
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,770
There's no reason to lose this.

1998
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:53,490
Yeah.

1999
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:53,510
Okay.

2000
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:58,990
I'm backing up.

2001
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:00,330
I'm backing up too.

2002
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:01,050
I'm using it.

2003
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,090
Let me call for it.

2004
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,170
I'm stuck.

2005
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,490
Oh, I got, I got, there's Psylocke.

2006
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:04,750
Psylocke.

2007
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,010
I'm ulting, I'm ulting here.

2008
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:07,310
I'm ulting.

2009
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,790
Doesn't matter.

2010
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,850
Yeah, we got it.

2011
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:13,330
We got it.

2012
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:14,670
We got it, we got it, we got it.

2013
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:15,450
Good shit.

2014
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,150
Nice.

2015
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,250
Can't move.

2016
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:18,370
Nice.

2017
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:18,930
Yeah.

2018
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,610
Oh my god, we did it.

2019
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,970
Bro, why did they Psylocke into Neymar?

2020
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,430
They got killed by my squids every single time.

2021
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,770
Okay, battle.

2022
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:27,650
Game winning kill.

2023
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:28,890
Alright, battle, battle.

2024
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,750
Last kill on you from you.

2025
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:34,610
Good shit.

2026
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,150
We figured it out.

2027
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,450
We figured them out.

2028
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,390
I barely healed them.

2029
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,450
He kept us alive.

2030
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:46,770
So, when I died, I was like, he kept them alive.

2031
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:47,970
Hell yeah.

2032
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:51,490
I fucking suck at Hella and I still did that.

2033
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:53,730
It's okay.

2034
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,050
Oh my god, to be fair, you did more healing than your Loki.

2035
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,750
Like, that's actually impressive for...

2036
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,710
Wait, what the fuck was their Loki doing?

2037
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,270
Yeah, you did more healing than their fucking Loki.

2038
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,630
That's pretty impressive.

2039
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,450
Maybe they just weren't good at domination maps either.

2040
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:10,950
I don't know.

2041
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,190
Oh, that was...

2042
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,330
Guys, that was a little too nerve-wracking.

2043
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:18,590
We need to do that for the finals, not for this one.

2044
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,350
I think we saved...

2045
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:20,790
I think...

2046
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,930
We don't need to save Mag anymore.

2047
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:26,250
Like, if we were saving Mag for battle, but I think he's...

2048
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,450
Yeah, I think battle...

2049
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:27,730
Yeah, battle.

2050
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,810
Battle, you've, like, improved so much on Strange.

2051
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,310
Am I ready?

2052
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:31,810
You're so ready.

2053
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:32,350
You're graduated.

2054
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,670
You're no longer a one-trick.

2055
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,950
You're no longer a one-trick battle!

2056
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,690
Battle, you've graduated from one-trick.

2057
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,370
You have several tricks.

2058
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:42,650
Oh my god.

2059
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:43,710
Thank you.

2060
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,850
You're now a two-trick.

2061
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:45,790
It's perfect.

2062
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,190
Isn't that great?

2063
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,790
I think, like, if the dog's happy.

2064
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,070
Yeah, my dog's so happy now.

2065
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:57,390
And he's also like, feed me, but it's too early to feed him.

2066
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,770
It's way too early, but he knows I'm awake.

2067
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:07,750
I love that the first game, we just struggled, but then, like, after that, we just, you know, completely, like, readjusted and did a lot better.

2068
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:08,770
That was still good.

2069
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,310
That second game was kind of scary, too.

2070
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,990
It was.

2071
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:11,530
It was scary.

2072
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,290
Dude, no, you hit the game-winning ults.

2073
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:14,790
Yeah, the game-winning ults.

2074
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:20,650
Yeah, and then, like, my fucking ult didn't go off during the Strange ult, too, and I was like, oh no.

2075
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,930
I was so scared.

2076
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:23,890
Yeah, I was freaking out.

2077
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:24,950
I was like, oh no.

2078
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:28,090
I just soul-bonded and started spamming everything on you.

2079
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,910
I was like, live, Poki, live!

2080
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,950
Oh, you did it.

2081
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:33,770
I think, like...

2082
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,430
When...

2083
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:34,830
Yeah?

2084
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:42,770
No, I was gonna say, when we all died on the last map on the first point, the Hella came chasing me down and I killed her before Strange got me.

2085
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:43,810
That was my favorite part.

2086
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:44,710
Nice.

2087
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:48,990
I'm gonna look at the challenge.

2088
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:49,610
Okay.

2089
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,110
Okay, we're gonna...

2090
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,130
Oh, every other team got 2-0'd.

2091
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,250
We were the only team that was, like, 2-1.

2092
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,690
Oh, wait, no, actually.

2093
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:06,730
Wait, Mace's team is also... I think Mace's team is... not struggling, but they haven't posted their score yet.

2094
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:09,250
That's interesting.

2095
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,110
We're gonna be facing...

2096
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:13,110
Yeah, I'm watching it, too.

2097
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:16,350
Gomez, we're facing the team... the omnomnom team.

2098
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:17,490
The one that we watch.

2099
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:17,990
Omnomnom.

2100
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:18,910
The one that, like...

2101
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:19,150
Okay.

2102
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:19,590
Yeah.

2103
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,330
I'll be honest, I don't remember.

2104
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:27,670
Okay, so it's the one with the... I wrote stuff down for us, just in case.

2105
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,730
Oh my god, where is... where are the notes that I wrote?

2106
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:39,130
Oh my god, where is it?

2107
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,570
That's the Magic team.

2108
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:43,590
Oh, the Dive team.

2109
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:44,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Dive team.

2110
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:51,230
Apparently a team got removed from the bracket, like, in our... or something.

2111
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,030
I don't know what happened.

2112
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,550
Wait, which team?

2113
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,750
Which team got removed?

2114
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,750
Someone's cheating.

2115
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:01,930
In our bracket?

2116
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:08,690
Oh, something... like, check the channel, the top 12.

2117
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:10,330
I think they explained why.

2118
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:12,730
Wait, what?

2119
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:13,910
Where did they explain it?

2120
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,870
I think they probably got disqualified or something.

2121
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,410
Probably a disqualification.

2122
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,110
I'm not sure.

2123
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:33,230
Inappropriate comments that were made by people in the event.

2124
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,630
A bunch of terrible teammates.

2125
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:40,170
Wow.

2126
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:46,610
I mean, the name... I guess the name fit the...

2127
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,590
Yeah, I think the name fit the whole criteria.

2128
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:50,690
That's the name of the team?

2129
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:52,290
Wait, that was... what?

2130
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,150
Wait, they self-reported.

2131
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:56,330
What?

2132
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:02,310
Maybe someone didn't approve of what was being said, and they were like, I'm gonna gather this shit.

2133
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:05,010
Bro, that's... that's... that's scary.

2134
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:13,990
The team removed a bunch of terrible teammates due to a document that they themselves released publicly that contained inappropriate comments that were made by people in the event.

2135
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:14,690
What?

2136
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,190
Oh my god.

2137
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,750
Is this some VTuber drama stuff?

2138
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,370
I don't know what this is.

2139
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:21,850
I don't know.

2140
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:22,670
I don't know either.

2141
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:24,890
That's crazy.

2142
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,690
The self-report was crazy.

2143
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,270
Yeah.

2144
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,870
What's the bracket?

2145
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,010
Oh, is Mace's team the only one that's like...

2146
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:37,230
Well, we're fighting Team OmNomNom next, so...

2147
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,070
Did we make the lobby, or is someone casting it?

2148
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,470
I think they will ping us.

2149
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,750
Are we behind on the schedule, or are we ahead?

2150
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:45,650
No, we're good.

2151
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,390
Okay.

2152
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:47,350
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

2153
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:49,230
Can I stand up or something?

2154
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:50,910
Yeah.

2155
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,890
So, are you asking for mission to stand up?

2156
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:54,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2157
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:56,330
Dude, why don't you stand up for yourself?

2158
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,090
Yeah, I was like, why are you asking...

2159
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:01,590
We're not like, why are we in, like, school right now?

2160
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,650
Teacher, can I please stand up?

2161
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,850
Excuse me, Miss Doki, can I leave?

2162
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,370
I'm leaving.

2163
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:07,990
I'm leaving.

2164
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:08,970
Oh, so funny.

2165
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,330
I'm gonna use the bathroom, too.

2166
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:15,250
I'll be right back.

2167
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:16,290
Same, be right back.

2168
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,480
You know what?

2169
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:24,820
Hold on.

2170
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,280
I just thought about something.

2171
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,080
Can't we just ban Venom?

2172
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,000
That just makes Magic really bad.

2173
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,280
Against the next team.

2174
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,940
Yeah, because that helps.

2175
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,260
Because Venom and Magic together is just, like, annoying as hell.

2176
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,420
It's terrible to deal with.

2177
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,140
They're obviously gonna first ban my Starlight, and then we just save Hela.

2178
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,580
Or no, we save Namor.

2179
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,420
No, wait, they're just gonna ban Luna.

2180
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,980
Yeah, they ban Luna there.

2181
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,680
I mean, it's fine.

2182
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,280
I think we can probably...

2183
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,160
I do like the Venom ban, though, because it limits a lot of their dive stuff.

2184
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,080
Because he's the one that initiates the dive.

2185
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,260
Hold on.

2186
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,300
Wait, I have my teammate that's watching.

2187
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:11,380
Hold on.

2188
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,300
Hogs, are you still here?

2189
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,520
Are you here, Hogs?

2190
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,000
Where's Hogs?

2191
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,960
Hold on, let me go ask him.

2192
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,320
I think Hogs was in here before, too.

2193
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,040
I don't know where he is.

2194
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,960
I'm gonna steal him to do some stuff.

2195
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,660
I'm gonna join... I'll be right back.

2196
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,080
I'm gonna join VC with him and let him help me with this stuff.

2197
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,040
Okay.

2198
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:55,920
Alright.

2199
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,840
Alright, where is he?

2200
01:13:58,980 --> 01:13:59,520
Alright, I'll be back.

2201
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,640
I'm back.

2202
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,800
Welcome back.

2203
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,360
Oh, Hogs.

2204
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,060
Oh, are they discussing strats?

2205
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,480
Yeah, against the team that we'll fight.

2206
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,700
Oh, yeah.

2207
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,840
It's fine, he's like a diver team.

2208
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:25,220
I don't remember if they... I don't remember if they fucking run what their tank lineup was.

2209
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,300
I wrote stuff down, so I'll look up what I wrote.

2210
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,700
Let's see.

2211
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,000
Okay, they protect Strange.

2212
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,500
They have a Strange.

2213
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,500
These are the characters they protect.

2214
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,500
They protect Strange, Black Panther, Magic, and Bucky.

2215
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,480
And their best player is a Magic player.

2216
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,780
They don't have a Venom.

2217
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,040
They don't play Venom.

2218
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,440
They don't play Venom?

2219
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,160
No, I remember they don't play Venom.

2220
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,280
I can watch their VODs right now.

2221
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,140
I don't remember ever seeing them play Venom.

2222
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,260
Okay.

2223
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,820
Yeah, because they don't.

2224
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,900
They play Thor with their Magic.

2225
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:14,120
Because their best tank player is a Strange one trick.

2226
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,600
So, yeah, I should message.

2227
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,280
If Gomez is talking to Hogswell, message.

2228
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:24,220
They don't have a Venom player.

2229
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,080
They have Strange one trick.

2230
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:32,660
And...

2231
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:34,780
Okay.

2232
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:37,780
Yeah.

2233
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:41,900
And their support lineup is just Cloak and Sue.

2234
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,060
Or Luna.

2235
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,880
It's either Luna, Cloak, or Cloak and Sue.

2236
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:48,800
Okay.

2237
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,240
No Loki.

2238
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,160
No Loki.

2239
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,780
They don't have a player that plays Loki.

2240
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,000
Loki is not their strongest support.

2241
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,480
Cloak and Sue, alright.

2242
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,380
But, yeah, let me see what else I wrote.

2243
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,520
So, I think we should ban Magic.

2244
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,100
Just because their best player.

2245
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:10,500
Their best player, if Magic is open, they always pick Magic.

2246
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,820
Then what do they pick after if Magic is banned?

2247
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,100
If Magic is banned, they protect either Black Panther or Strange.

2248
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:19,760
Okay.

2249
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,360
And I rather just not have a Magic player.

2250
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:26,580
Yeah.

2251
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,940
And, yeah, so...

2252
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:31,520
Thank you.

2253
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,040
I'm checking to see if they do ever play Venom.

2254
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:40,690
But from what I remember, when I was going through the list, I've never seen them play...

2255
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,120
They play Penny.

2256
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,580
Their other tank, that's not, like, mostly a Strange...

2257
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,060
Like, their Strange might get flexed to Mag.

2258
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,280
But their other tank is literally, like, whatever the fuck they play.

2259
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,340
But I've only seen them play Thor, Mag, and Penny.

2260
01:16:59,130 --> 01:16:59,590
So...

2261
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:03,550
Yeah, no Venom.

2262
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,730
Oh, actually, wait.

2263
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:08,050
Oh, the one time they played... Wait.

2264
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:08,570
No, never mind.

2265
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:09,430
They swapped off Venom.

2266
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:11,630
Oh, I think they, like...

2267
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,750
Oh, they swapped off.

2268
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:14,670
Yeah, they played... No, they were just...

2269
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:15,990
They were like, what if I play Venom?

2270
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:16,910
And they swapped off.

2271
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,850
So, yeah, no Venom players.

2272
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,590
I'm looking through everything else.

2273
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:32,170
I'm pretty sure, like, a lot of teams are gonna analyze our... the match that we just had.

2274
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:36,090
Because they'll be like, how did that team took, like, you know, took a point off of them?

2275
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:44,930
Honestly, I blame first game of the day type of thing.

2276
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:46,950
Honestly, yeah, no, I was making a lot of mistakes.

2277
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:47,710
I was not warm.

2278
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:48,450
I was definitely not warm.

2279
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:49,110
No, me too.

2280
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,930
I think many of us were.

2281
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:52,450
No.

2282
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,810
The practice room is not quite enough.

2283
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:58,330
Definitely.

2284
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,630
I mean...

2285
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,010
I don't even know.

2286
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,110
Is our game casted or not?

2287
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:05,430
Because do we have to wait?

2288
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:07,510
I guess we're waiting for...

2289
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,630
Are we waiting for, like...

2290
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:13,810
I think we're waiting for everyone to finish or some shit.

2291
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:14,290
I'm not sure.

2292
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,530
Wait, everybody's playing different maps.

2293
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:20,270
I thought everyone would play the same map.

2294
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,510
Yeah, because, like, Maze's team is playing on...

2295
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:26,590
In the...

2296
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:27,390
What map is this called?

2297
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,050
Spider Island.

2298
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,230
Oh, is he on round two already?

2299
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:30,810
I don't know.

2300
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,810
I don't know if this is round two or three.

2301
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,190
No, because we never played this map, though.

2302
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:35,830
That's the thing.

2303
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,110
I thought, like, they would...

2304
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:39,530
Everybody would be playing the same map.

2305
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:40,430
That's fucking weird.

2306
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:44,360
I'm so lost.

2307
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:44,700
Oh, wait.

2308
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,460
I thought...

2309
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,260
Unless they're on round two.

2310
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,860
Like, but we didn't get anything to, like, move on.

2311
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:49,460
So...

2312
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,260
So, round two...

2313
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:50,980
I don't know.

2314
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:53,400
Um...

2315
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,340
I guess...

2316
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,100
Uh...

2317
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,440
Doesn't he have to be the same map?

2318
01:18:59,340 --> 01:18:59,920
I don't know.

2319
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,680
I think, like, if we're in the same bracket...

2320
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,760
It should be the same map, just to make it fair.

2321
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,120
Yeah.

2322
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,940
Like, because this is the winner's bracket, and everybody should play on the same maps for winner's bracket.

2323
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,380
Because there's no map bans.

2324
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,060
Alright.

2325
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,560
I have the news.

2326
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,020
What?

2327
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,620
So we're banning... We're banning Magic first.

2328
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,340
Yeah.

2329
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,080
We're gonna do that.

2330
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:23,760
Oh, yeah.

2331
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,640
Because then... Because then if they BP, all we do is...

2332
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,060
I'm probably gonna Bucky again, or Hella.

2333
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:28,500
Either one.

2334
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:29,860
Uh, both are really good.

2335
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,680
They should not be able to have an easy time.

2336
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,140
They have a strange one trick, which I'm pretty sure they're gonna...

2337
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,760
I don't know what they protect other than Magic.

2338
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,200
What do they do?

2339
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,320
They protect... I wrote it down.

2340
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,640
They protect Strange, Black Panther, Magic, or Bucky.

2341
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,180
Okay, depending on the matchup, I don't think they wanna go into Bucky.

2342
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,180
Alright, no.

2343
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,440
They'll keep Bucky open.

2344
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,740
If we ban the Magic, I'm guessing.

2345
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,500
But I'm better than him at Bucky, so I'll just play Bucky.

2346
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,480
Then that means Luna ban will be open.

2347
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,320
Because they don't have to worry about Perma diving the whole time.

2348
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:01,540
Oh, wait.

2349
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,000
This is perfect.

2350
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:02,880
Yeah.

2351
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,600
Oh, this is perfect.

2352
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:04,940
Oh, no.

2353
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:05,960
We got it.

2354
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:06,180
Okay.

2355
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,140
That's perfect.

2356
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:08,480
Alright.

2357
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,780
They protect BP, then they have to ban Luna anyway.

2358
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,900
Then that leaves open Hella Bucky for us.

2359
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,160
And then it just becomes even easier.

2360
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:17,880
That's good.

2361
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,140
Yeah.

2362
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,500
Their best player is their Magic player, so like...

2363
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,060
That's all they have to worry about.

2364
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,660
Because they always try their best to protect the Magic.

2365
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:32,360
Oh.

2366
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,900
Oh, and then their support... None of their supports play Loki.

2367
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,340
Their support is Cloak.

2368
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,660
Their support lineup, I believe, is Cloak.

2369
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,720
Unless they make their DPS play Loki.

2370
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,060
But their two supports play only Cloak and... Cloak, Sue, and Luna.

2371
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,400
This should be fine.

2372
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,980
Are we just, like, waiting for every game to be finished?

2373
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,120
Yeah, I have no idea.

2374
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,160
I'm confused.

2375
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,520
Because, like...

2376
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,000
Did we finish, like, ahead of time?

2377
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,960
Or, like, are they, like... Yeah, I'm wondering.

2378
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,020
It would be weird if we had considered when we went to three games.

2379
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,400
That was a long one, yeah.

2380
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,280
Yeah, we went to three rounds, so I'm just, like...

2381
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,200
That felt more stressful than anything we did yesterday.

2382
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,080
Yeah, no.

2383
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:21,820
It sure did.

2384
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,220
I mean, it is winner's bracket, so...

2385
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:24,840
That's scary.

2386
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,380
How many games do we have today?

2387
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,980
We're guaranteed fifth now.

2388
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,220
We're in winner's semis.

2389
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,620
So, if we win three more sets, it's over.

2390
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:35,680
Okay.

2391
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,240
Yeah.

2392
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,080
But then we go to losers.

2393
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,480
We have, like, one, two, three, four, five games.

2394
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,120
Five matches, and we go to losers.

2395
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:44,660
Oh, fuck.

2396
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,480
But it's one elimination, though.

2397
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,120
So we can stop.

2398
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,380
But the loser bracket is one game.

2399
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,800
So, like, we can't make, like...

2400
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,920
It's like, we can't learn anything for the next game.

2401
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,260
Wait, the loser's bracket is one game?

2402
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,800
Yeah, one game, and you're out.

2403
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:58,920
Oh, my God.

2404
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,020
I know, right?

2405
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,340
That's so fucked up.

2406
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:03,460
Jesus.

2407
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:04,780
Why?

2408
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,420
I feel like the winner's brackets are going on at the same time.

2409
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,340
It's not gonna hold it up.

2410
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:09,780
I guess...

2411
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,640
I don't know.

2412
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,860
Okay.

2413
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,720
It's just, like...

2414
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,100
Fuck.

2415
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,000
You guys are losers for a reason.

2416
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,980
For a reason, maybe.

2417
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,040
I don't fucking know.

2418
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:22,920
That's crazy.

2419
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,780
You're incapable of adapting after one game.

2420
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,260
So we're gonna give you one game.

2421
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,380
It's like, you didn't adapt in winner's bracket.

2422
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,080
Why would we let you adapt now?

2423
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,800
That's insane.

2424
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,780
I've never heard of a format like that.

2425
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,700
That's unbelievable.

2426
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:46,500
Survival of the fittest, yeah.

2427
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:47,820
No, they won both.

2428
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:49,360
No, Mace's team won both their customs.

2429
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,340
That's weird.

2430
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:50,960
I don't know why.

2431
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,820
They won both of their games, so...

2432
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,340
I wonder why it took so long.

2433
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,460
I guess they started late or some shit.

2434
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,170
Okay.

2435
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,430
Oops.

2436
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,790
I accidentally opened Photoshop.

2437
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:14,370
Uh-oh.

2438
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:16,990
Okay, so...

2439
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,230
Mace just leaked out his ban line.

2440
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:21,010
So they...

2441
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:21,690
On us?

2442
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:22,430
So the Cobbler...

2443
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:23,250
The Cobbler...

2444
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,230
No, for his other team.

2445
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:24,790
Oh, okay.

2446
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,230
So the Cobbler...

2447
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,830
The Cobbler, if the thing is...

2448
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:29,610
Or if the...

2449
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:30,390
If Groot's not open...

2450
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:31,690
He goes the thing.

2451
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:36,290
So what if we banned out both?

2452
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:38,130
If we...

2453
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,410
If we put out Coney.

2454
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:41,190
We do that.

2455
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:42,450
We can like...

2456
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:43,990
Pure focus the front line guy.

2457
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:44,830
If we wanted.

2458
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:45,710
What?

2459
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:46,750
That's up to us.

2460
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,230
I think Coney's gonna do a better...

2461
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:49,890
Wait, are we not banning Mace's stuff?

2462
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,010
Uh...

2463
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:53,310
I think Mace...

2464
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:53,510
I...

2465
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:55,430
Nah, I don't think Mace has to be...

2466
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:56,310
I think...

2467
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:59,650
If we just make one of their plays like super weak...

2468
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,410
Then I think...

2469
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:02,950
It would be a lot easier.

2470
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:03,810
Kill the front liner?

2471
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,090
Yeah.

2472
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:06,710
Why not?

2473
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:07,550
Alright.

2474
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:08,310
Just kill him.

2475
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,330
Is that this set or the one after?

2476
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,730
If Mace wins against...

2477
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:15,410
Rigsy's team...

2478
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:16,710
Then we fight Mace's team.

2479
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:18,030
Got it.

2480
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:21,710
But like, we have to win this next one to be able to even have that chance.

2481
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:22,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2482
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,250
I don't want to look too far forward.

2483
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:24,990
Yeah, yeah.

2484
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:25,450
Yep.

2485
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:27,430
I'm fine with sitting out though.

2486
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,530
If we want to sub me up.

2487
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:31,030
I think your...

2488
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:31,950
I think your...

2489
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,010
Your thing would be better.

2490
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:34,330
Oh, it is?

2491
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:35,410
I know.

2492
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:35,870
You ain't gotta...

2493
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:36,210
Oh, yeah.

2494
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,650
Oh, yeah.

2495
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,010
You know now.

2496
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,450
He knows.

2497
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:41,450
That's the one character I'm good at.

2498
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,170
That's all it is.

2499
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,050
But...

2500
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,970
Don't say that out loud, Coney!

2501
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,890
You're good at so many other characters.

2502
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:48,730
Don't...

2503
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:49,250
Name one.

2504
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:49,850
Mag.

2505
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:51,310
Rocket.

2506
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:52,730
No, that's true.

2507
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:53,330
And Rocket.

2508
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:54,250
No, wait a minute.

2509
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,510
Wait.

2510
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:56,030
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2511
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:57,270
I got three.

2512
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:58,370
That's true.

2513
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,910
That's true.

2514
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,140
Okay.

2515
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:06,960
Oh, wait.

2516
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:07,800
What's this?

2517
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:10,960
Uh...

2518
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,200
Oh, we're all gonna be on the mainstream.

2519
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,260
Okay.

2520
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:15,840
Oh, my.

2521
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:16,460
The big...

2522
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,100
The big screen.

2523
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:17,880
Yeah.

2524
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,000
Big stage.

2525
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:19,720
Trombotron.

2526
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:20,740
Yeah.

2527
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:23,080
Oh, my God.

2528
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,760
We're gonna be on a big screen, everybody.

2529
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,520
I'm so scared.

2530
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,580
I'm, like, quivering in my pants.

2531
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,420
Well, people are, like, the...

2532
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,980
People are, like, why is it what...

2533
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:38,500
Yeah, a lot...

2534
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,020
Some people are complaining about the one game.

2535
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,340
The one and done.

2536
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,920
I think that's crazy.

2537
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,320
It is pretty crazy.

2538
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,000
Because, like, it's not even like your favorite kind.

2539
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:46,580
Right?

2540
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,100
Like...

2541
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:47,440
Yeah.

2542
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:49,300
I think it's...

2543
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:49,880
Yeah.

2544
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,100
It's pretty crazy.

2545
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,240
I'm just, like, damn.

2546
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,460
Because if you're doing it at the same time as the winner's bracket, it doesn't really matter.

2547
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,800
That's something you would do on the big days.

2548
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:06,440
Because, like, to keep it running, to keep the loser's sets cut down.

2549
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,380
But we're getting down to the end of it.

2550
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:08,860
Yeah.

2551
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2552
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:17,440
We just gotta wait for the caster to invite us.

2553
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,440
It is kind of crazy, especially with rivals.

2554
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,700
Because, like, snowballing is such a thing.

2555
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,040
Yeah.

2556
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:22,680
And, like...

2557
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,820
Based on, like, one set of picks.

2558
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,720
And then adapting and stuff.

2559
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,340
It's so crazy.

2560
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,480
That's so true.

2561
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,180
Like, you can't...

2562
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,840
There's, like, barely any time to adapt.

2563
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:36,590
It's also, like...

2564
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:37,370
People are, like, too afraid.

2565
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:38,850
Most sports tournaments...

2566
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:41,910
Yeah, but for most sports tournaments, games last an hour.

2567
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,710
These games are, like, 15 to 20 minutes.

2568
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,090
We finished one in, like, six minutes at one point.

2569
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,590
Because it was a slump.

2570
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:54,950
Like, it makes sense if it's, like, an hour long.

2571
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:55,910
But, like...

2572
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,310
These games are, like, 16 minutes and everything.

2573
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:00,110
Very fast.

2574
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,500
They do feel long.

2575
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah.

2576
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:09,760
The competitiveness of these games makes it much more harder.

2577
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,200
Looking at the challenge right now.

2578
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,700
Please invite us.

2579
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:25,450
Please invite us.

2580
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,900
I'm nervous and scared.

2581
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:35,780
Yeah, that's a good point.

2582
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:38,760
My chat said that's especially brutal for the people who start in losers.

2583
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,860
So, if you came in after losing yesterday...

2584
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,140
You wake up at 11 a.m., die, and then...

2585
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:45,440
Okay.

2586
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,320
And, like, it's the first game of the day, too.

2587
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,020
So, it's, like...

2588
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,760
Like, obviously, like, from us, like, our first game...

2589
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,580
Our first couple of games are, like, rough because we're not warmed up, too.

2590
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:57,360
Right.

2591
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,820
And it starts so early in the morning.

2592
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:00,760
Oh, my God.

2593
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,480
There's no time to warm up this early.

2594
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,400
Especially for the West Coasters.

2595
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,420
There's no time for us to warm up this early.

2596
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,020
I wake up this early.

2597
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:09,900
Anyways, it's fine.

2598
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:10,180
Oh, my God.

2599
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,020
What's wrong with you?

2600
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,440
I know.

2601
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,440
You have an actual...

2602
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,500
It's always weird when anyone's show organizes, like, a collab.

2603
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,600
And it's at such a weird time compared to literally anybody else's.

2604
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:19,960
Yeah, I love that.

2605
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,820
That's my favorite thing he does.

2606
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,900
That's my stream time, bro.

2607
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,580
Oh, my God.

2608
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,920
It's so early.

2609
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,280
Oh, my God.

2610
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,360
You're not even a West Coaster anymore.

2611
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,420
Oh, we got a user ID.

2612
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:40,920
Oh, we're good?

2613
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:41,440
Okay.

2614
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:42,240
Alright.

2615
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,500
I'm staying in, right?

2616
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:48,940
Gomez, unmute.

2617
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2618
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:50,400
I'm here.

2619
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:52,400
Is Beto staying in?

2620
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:54,240
Just engage?

2621
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,360
I think Beto will stay in for the first one.

2622
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:57,940
Okay.

2623
01:28:58,720 --> 01:28:59,200
Okay.

2624
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,020
Team Omnomnom.

2625
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,540
Okay, is anyone friends with the UID?

2626
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:10,680
No.

2627
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,400
It's friends only.

2628
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,220
Oh.

2629
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,520
Here, I'll join it.

2630
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,080
Okay, I'm gonna add them and then un-add them.

2631
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,620
Have you cleaned up your friends list?

2632
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,640
Oh, it's still full.

2633
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,000
Alright.

2634
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,820
Oh, it's still full to the brim.

2635
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,820
I should probably do... I don't know who to remove, though.

2636
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,520
I'm in.

2637
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,120
Yay!

2638
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,180
Thank you.

2639
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,380
I'm in.

2640
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,660
Oh, we're missing Beto.

2641
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,240
Oh, you got Beto.

2642
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:48,460
Okay.

2643
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,590
Let me increase the friend limit.

2644
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:56,530
I need more friends.

2645
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:58,670
Please.

2646
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:01,130
It says no one.

2647
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:04,830
Why do you... Wait, what's the limit again?

2648
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,790
It's 150.

2649
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:10,970
Why the fuck do you have 150 people on your friends list?

2650
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:12,150
He's popular.

2651
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:15,470
Well, there's a lot of people that I know from Overwatch.

2652
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:18,250
A lot of them are pro players.

2653
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,110
It's time to cut them out.

2654
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:20,170
A lot of them are...

2655
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,230
Overwatch is saying it's time to cut them out.

2656
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,670
It's like from an Xbox game.

2657
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:26,790
The what?

2658
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:27,810
I've never seen that before.

2659
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,810
The what have you seen?

2660
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:32,210
Kony?

2661
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:32,810
Oh, sorry.

2662
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:33,550
I was talking to my chat.

2663
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:34,130
I thought it was me.

2664
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:37,130
I was looking at the Lucasboy icon.

2665
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:39,710
It looks like a PS2 game model.

2666
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:40,450
You see that there?

2667
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:41,070
Oh, yeah.

2668
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,730
Doesn't it look weird?

2669
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,630
It's one of the special ones.

2670
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:45,750
I don't remember where you got it.

2671
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:49,050
Oh, it's the Marvel Cards game.

2672
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:49,950
The Marvel Snap stuff.

2673
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:50,630
Oh, yeah.

2674
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,130
I remember.

2675
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:54,150
Yeah, that's why it looks, like, bad.

2676
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:58,110
Is it possible to tell them to wait five minutes?

2677
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:59,070
It looks like a MOBA model.

2678
01:30:59,230 --> 01:30:59,450
Okay.

2679
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:03,230
Oh, and they'll ask us if we're ready.

2680
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,150
So, I hope.

2681
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:05,770
I don't know.

2682
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:06,930
They did it the first time.

2683
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:08,230
The first time.

2684
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:09,530
Yeah, but this is a mainstream.

2685
01:31:09,790 --> 01:31:11,890
There's no way the mainstream wouldn't.

2686
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,430
I'm gonna get some water.

2687
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:14,030
I'll be back.

2688
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:15,370
Just go.

2689
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:15,750
Just go.

2690
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:16,650
We'll let them know.

2691
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,670
Okay.

2692
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,530
I'll be back.

2693
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:19,330
I need to get water anyway.

2694
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,130
Oh, I'm back.

2695
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:38,790
Oh, they're waiting a few minutes anyway.

2696
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:39,930
Nice.

2697
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:49,480
Pretty sure they're just waiting for the casters, because I'm pretty sure it's not just one caster.

2698
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:01,770
Alright.

2699
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,090
Oh, my voice.

2700
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:07,030
My voice is not okay anymore.

2701
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:09,050
Is there a bracket?

2702
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:12,250
I don't know if the bracket's public knowledge at all.

2703
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:16,250
I don't... Does anyone know if the bracket's supposed to be public knowledge?

2704
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:18,210
Because if it is, I can just link you guys the bracket.

2705
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,910
Um...

2706
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,470
Yeah, I definitely need some rest.

2707
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,290
Uh, it's supposed to be?

2708
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:27,710
Okay.

2709
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:29,750
Here's the bracket.

2710
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:33,950
Um, yeah, it's public?

2711
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:34,350
Okay.

2712
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:35,350
Cody already showed it.

2713
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:35,930
Alright, I'll show you.

2714
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,490
I'll pin the bracket.

2715
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,030
I'll just pin it then.

2716
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,390
Uh, I'll pin it for everybody.

2717
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:50,490
I think it's also, like, really fucked, because we played ranked together with the team last night.

2718
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:56,070
And, like, we got to, like, as you can see, like, the entire team's Celestial now.

2719
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:59,410
So we won, like, every game except for, like, we lost...

2720
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:03,050
Well, I... They lost one... They were four-stacking, and then they lost one game.

2721
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:05,930
And I joined in, because Shoto wanted to join.

2722
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,330
So then, obviously, you can't five-stack.

2723
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:12,330
So I hopped on, so we could do a six-stack for everybody.

2724
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:14,790
Um...

2725
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:22,750
And then we, like... I didn't lose a game during the ranked cry with them, but...

2726
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:25,630
But, yeah.

2727
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,170
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2728
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:29,930
It's scary.

2729
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:33,170
Please try not to strain it.

2730
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,150
Yeah, I'm trying my best, guys.

2731
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:39,110
So, like, I talked a lot after the tournament, too.

2732
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:41,430
Hello.

2733
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:42,590
Hey.

2734
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:43,650
Hello.

2735
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:44,310
I'm ready.

2736
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:45,870
Oh, yeah.

2737
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:47,950
Ready to go.

2738
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:49,310
I don't think they are, though.

2739
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,350
Did we say where we are?

2740
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:54,170
Or, like, is the casters not ready?

2741
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,370
No, they're waiting for us.

2742
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:56,630
No.

2743
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:57,710
Oh, they are?

2744
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,810
Yeah, we are ready.

2745
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,050
Oh.

2746
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:01,530
We're all here?

2747
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:02,550
Okay.

2748
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,440
Oh, okay.

2749
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,300
That was cute.

2750
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,000
That was cute.

2751
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,220
Oh, I thought that was... I thought that was Gumball making that noise.

2752
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,480
No, it was, like, the cat.

2753
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:20,520
The cat.

2754
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,180
He's just really good at it.

2755
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,760
Cat meow back.

2756
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,920
Oh, my God.

2757
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,540
I was going to grab him, but he went under my bed.

2758
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,420
Oh, it's domination first.

2759
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:33,340
Domination.

2760
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:34,080
Oh, my.

2761
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,840
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2762
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,500
Man, get rid of... get rid of that magic.

2763
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,540
We don't like magic.

2764
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,720
Yeah, we don't like magic in this house.

2765
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:43,980
I shine in darkness.

2766
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,000
No, we hate magic.

2767
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,780
Yeah, we hate mutants.

2768
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:49,560
That's right.

2769
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,720
I thought we hate... I thought we hate Rocket.

2770
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:52,880
I can hate two things.

2771
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:53,700
You do hate Rocket, too?

2772
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,280
Yeah.

2773
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,580
My hate is not... my hate is unlimited.

2774
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,360
Oh, I get the Star Lord!

2775
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,540
Oh, you get the Star Lord.

2776
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,020
We protect Star Lord.

2777
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:03,500
Yeah, you get the Star Lord.

2778
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,020
That's fine.

2779
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,100
Get rid of... wait.

2780
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:07,140
You can imagine.

2781
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,280
What if we actually leave the Star Lord open?

2782
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:10,600
What if we do?

2783
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,540
And protect something else?

2784
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:14,540
No, just protect Star Lord.

2785
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:15,900
I think Star Lord is fine.

2786
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:16,980
Yeah, just protect Star Lord.

2787
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,040
Because we have strain.

2788
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:19,740
We do have strain.

2789
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:20,820
Oh my god, I get the Star Lord!

2790
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:20,860
Yeah, that's fine.

2791
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:21,640
If you have strain, just mag.

2792
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:22,540
We'll make it work.

2793
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:23,080
That's fine.

2794
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:23,860
What if they ban mag?

2795
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,640
If they ban mag, I'm on Venom or something.

2796
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:27,040
Yeah.

2797
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,860
You'll probably be on Venom or another support.

2798
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:30,440
And then protect Star Lord.

2799
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:30,760
Yeah.

2800
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:32,700
I'll play Rocket.

2801
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,820
I mean, fucking...

2802
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,480
Bring it back.

2803
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:36,160
Bring back the Rocket.

2804
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,160
If I have to.

2805
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,140
Protect Black Panther.

2806
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:41,520
Okay.

2807
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:44,100
Yeah, see, like I said, that's their protect lineup.

2808
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:45,740
What's their second ban again?

2809
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,780
We don't know yet.

2810
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,300
Probably... I feel like they might ban Luna or Namor if they don't ban mag.

2811
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,880
Did they do the research?

2812
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,160
Are they gonna ban Battle?

2813
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,680
Let's see.

2814
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,840
Oh, interesting.

2815
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,460
We've lessened strain to Venom.

2816
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,840
So now who do we ban after that?

2817
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:07,520
If we want.

2818
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:09,600
Have I seen... Wait.

2819
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,120
Oh, nevermind.

2820
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,320
I've seen Kony's captain.

2821
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:12,980
No, it's not Kony.

2822
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,100
I'm hovering Groot right now, but what do you guys think?

2823
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:16,300
Two?

2824
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,360
Groot?

2825
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,380
Get rid of Bucky.

2826
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,060
Get rid of Bucky.

2827
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:22,080
Get rid of that character.

2828
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:22,580
Oh.

2829
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:23,840
Just type it.

2830
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:24,460
Ban Bucky.

2831
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:27,860
Yeah.

2832
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,000
I'm down four.

2833
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,200
I could do Rocket, Fantastic, or Venom.

2834
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:31,720
What do you think?

2835
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,500
Fantastic will die against a Panther.

2836
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,480
That's the only thing.

2837
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:38,700
Probably.

2838
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:39,260
Yeah.

2839
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:47,550
I'm gonna keep the orb on Gomez.

2840
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:49,370
Yes.

2841
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:52,650
We have combo.

2842
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,230
I get free roam the whole map.

2843
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:57,090
Kony, you just...

2844
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,870
Remember not to engage with your slam.

2845
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,210
I guess we'll honor it.

2846
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:03,650
Okay, thanks.

2847
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:05,890
That's... Like, what?

2848
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:08,630
I guess... Like, people do it in pro play.

2849
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:09,530
Huh?

2850
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:13,870
They do do it in pro play.

2851
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:14,870
Like...

2852
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:18,050
Like, we instant said it, too.

2853
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:19,410
We didn't click it.

2854
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:24,810
So generous of them to honor it.

2855
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:25,890
Oh, my God.

2856
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,530
I didn't like that.

2857
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:28,710
I didn't like that at all.

2858
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,370
Bad vibes.

2859
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:31,070
Bad vibes.

2860
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,550
That did leave a bad taste in my mouth, but...

2861
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:34,850
I guess we'll honor it.

2862
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:42,190
Alright, let's do it.

2863
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:44,810
Alright.

2864
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:47,170
Alright, so I should free roam or free roam the backline?

2865
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,230
Yes, sir.

2866
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:50,570
I'm splitting from you guys.

2867
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:50,870
Shit.

2868
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:51,650
Wait.

2869
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:54,590
Wait, we... Do we restart?

2870
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:54,970
What?

2871
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:56,850
Hold on, hold on.

2872
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:57,090
Wait.

2873
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:57,870
I think we should.

2874
01:38:57,970 --> 01:38:58,710
I think we probably should.

2875
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:59,470
Yeah, if nobody dies...

2876
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:02,010
Somebody... Like, we need someone to message.

2877
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:06,950
Oh, there's no pauses.

2878
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:10,430
Uh...

2879
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:11,410
No one died yet.

2880
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:12,410
We can restart.

2881
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:12,810
No one died.

2882
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:17,950
They're not restarting.

2883
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:20,230
We all leave.

2884
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:20,770
We just leave.

2885
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:21,290
Oh, we have to leave.

2886
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,190
Yeah, we leave.

2887
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,790
Shrug.

2888
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:25,230
Shrug?

2889
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,170
What is with this guy?

2890
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,050
What the fuck is wrong with this team?

2891
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,090
Wait, hold on a second.

2892
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:30,190
Hold on.

2893
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:31,050
Bro, what is that?

2894
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:32,190
What the fuck?

2895
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,070
Bro.

2896
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:35,210
Wait.

2897
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:36,850
What is wrong with them?

2898
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:39,490
Wait, we just... We don't even know these guys.

2899
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:40,070
Hold on.

2900
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:40,810
Vibe's rancid.

2901
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,210
We don't even know them.

2902
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:44,150
Oh.

2903
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:48,790
Is he just like a... Is he the doomer of the team?

2904
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:49,350
I don't know.

2905
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:51,190
He probably sounds like... I don't know, man.

2906
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,850
It's just...

2907
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:52,590
Yeah, I mean...

2908
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,310
I'm stunlocked.

2909
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:55,850
To be fair, the I guess and also the...

2910
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:00,050
Oh, shit.

2911
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:00,730
I accidentally ignored.

2912
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:01,190
Whoops.

2913
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:05,350
I restarted my game, so it didn't crash.

2914
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:05,730
One sec.

2915
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:07,410
I don't know.

2916
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:09,270
Yeah, Lymo just like DC'd.

2917
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:11,190
Like, all of a sudden.

2918
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:13,770
Lymo's gone.

2919
01:40:14,350 --> 01:40:16,330
If it happens before first kill, we're good.

2920
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:18,150
Yeah, there's no fear.

2921
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:20,090
Imagine if I got it killed in the beginning.

2922
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:20,850
Dude.

2923
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:27,990
Can we... Can you swap... Can I get benched in between games or do you keep the same thing for the whole set?

2924
01:40:27,990 --> 01:40:30,590
We have to keep the same thing in the first... Because then that's... Yeah.

2925
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:31,750
Sure.

2926
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:32,250
That's fine.

2927
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,090
Hey, y'all DC from the lobby, right?

2928
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:34,910
Yeah.

2929
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:35,870
Like, Lymo crashed.

2930
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:37,670
Okay, just add the same person again.

2931
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:38,370
Sorry?

2932
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:39,970
Lymo crashed, so we had to.

2933
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:41,810
Okay, that's fine.

2934
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:43,190
Yeah, we can reset them.

2935
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:44,630
Alright, thank you.

2936
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:47,330
Alright, I'm inviting all of you.

2937
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:47,830
Alright, I'm back.

2938
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,570
What if we like keep the same bad line?

2939
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:51,210
Yeah.

2940
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:56,590
Okay, boom.

2941
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:58,950
And then we're one for Lymo.

2942
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,090
Yeah, that was weird.

2943
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,010
Yeah, that was weird.

2944
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:03,710
That was.

2945
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:05,310
Hmm.

2946
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:08,070
We will keep the same.

2947
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:09,650
Hello?

2948
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:10,230
Hello.

2949
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:11,210
Hello.

2950
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:12,330
That was awful.

2951
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:14,730
My graphics card driver hitched and then it just went...

2952
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:17,130
And just that was the only noise I could hear.

2953
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:17,810
It was great.

2954
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:20,650
Coming back.

2955
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:23,450
Yeah, that's the noise.

2956
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:24,290
That was the noise.

2957
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:27,890
Oh, that was my cat.

2958
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:28,670
I know.

2959
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:30,590
You're like PTSD.

2960
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:32,590
It's like, oh my god, my graphics card.

2961
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,950
Yeah, alright, let me put him down.

2962
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,050
Alright, let me know when you're...

2963
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:39,890
No, I'm not going to kill him.

2964
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:40,970
No, put him on the floor.

2965
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:44,450
Whoa, I'm going to put him down.

2966
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:46,230
Overreaction much?

2967
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:46,790
Christ.

2968
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:53,010
Did you see that same person got kind of funny about the fact that we needed to remake?

2969
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:55,770
Yeah, the fact that he said shrug at us.

2970
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,090
We were like, the fuck?

2971
01:41:58,570 --> 01:41:59,950
Dude, I don't know.

2972
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:04,750
Clearly, tournaments should be decided over who's NVIDIA drivers decide to shit themselves.

2973
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:06,410
That's right.

2974
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:10,070
Alright, I'm back if I can grab an invite.

2975
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:12,750
I got it.

2976
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:13,470
There you go.

2977
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:14,610
Thank you.

2978
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:18,030
I'll join the spectators so they can swap you over.

2979
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:24,960
Wait, why am I joining?

2980
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,560
Because they took the spot.

2981
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:27,680
Oh wait, no, never mind.

2982
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,700
Oh wait, we swapped teams.

2983
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:29,260
Oops, sorry.

2984
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,840
I thought I was on team B for some reason.

2985
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:35,900
Alright, so they TP at the very beginning.

2986
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,200
Do we keep the same or do we just TP straight away?

2987
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,240
Up to you guys.

2988
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:48,480
Does it matter?

2989
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:49,300
Does it matter?

2990
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:49,600
Okay.

2991
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:56,660
For throne room, you have to get that room first.

2992
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:58,300
It's so hard to push out of.

2993
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,060
Oh wait, stop.

2994
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:03,900
Not ready.

2995
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,100
Not armed.

2996
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,920
Oh, Lime crashed again.

2997
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:10,400
Okay, Lime is gone.

2998
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,040
What the fuck?

2999
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:12,840
Bro.

3000
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:14,260
What is wrong?

3001
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:16,820
Why are they so passive aggressive to us?

3002
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:17,440
It's not our fault.

3003
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,980
What's the bro period for?

3004
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:19,520
Come on.

3005
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,360
Dude, we're having issues.

3006
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:22,000
Chill.

3007
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,040
Yeah, this is...

3008
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:29,560
Why are they trying to antagonize us?

3009
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,700
What do they not like about us?

3010
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:38,560
I don't know.

3011
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,220
What do we do?

3012
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:40,500
What do we do?

3013
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,120
It's me guys, sorry.

3014
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:44,840
Bro, what did you do?

3015
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:45,660
It's me.

3016
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:46,260
It's just me.

3017
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:46,860
I don't know.

3018
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,560
I want to talk so much shit right now.

3019
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:50,960
Oh.

3020
01:43:53,120 --> 01:44:00,400
I have my chat open and I'm just looking at the blinking line, but I'm abstaining.

3021
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,100
I'm stopping.

3022
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:05,540
Oh man.

3023
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,200
Hope our PC is okay.

3024
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,240
We might need to put Jay in and put me on support.

3025
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:18,240
No, no, no.

3026
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,240
We might need to.

3027
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,500
I mean, I could support like me and Doki.

3028
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:25,520
You forgot bro.

3029
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,180
What the fuck?

3030
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:26,700
What happened?

3031
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:28,940
He forgot.

3032
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,720
I was flexed.

3033
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,120
Yes, but then we have to play.

3034
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,720
Then like, that's the thing.

3035
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:36,600
What do we play though?

3036
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,080
Three tank, three tank, one DPS.

3037
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:40,660
Okay, three tank, one DPS.

3038
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:40,980
Okay.

3039
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:43,300
Three tank, one DPS, two support.

3040
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,660
And I mean, we just... I'm really solid on...

3041
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,900
The audio is just buzzing.

3042
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:48,940
Even with reboot.

3043
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,260
Even with reboot.

3044
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:52,280
Uh oh.

3045
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:53,340
Oh no.

3046
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,520
That's not good.

3047
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,920
She needs the audio.

3048
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,200
Is this true?

3049
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:02,220
I got this in my chat.

3050
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:04,380
Coney is a human Torx level shit talker.

3051
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,160
Is this true?

3052
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,060
Oh yeah.

3053
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:10,720
We don't do it like publicly.

3054
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:13,980
Yeah, I have a rule.

3055
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,580
Because I played League for ten years.

3056
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,740
I have a rule though.

3057
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:20,400
I don't... Only if the other person flames first.

3058
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:20,780
Right?

3059
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,100
You never throw the fucking punch.

3060
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:22,960
The moral code.

3061
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:23,880
Yes.

3062
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,760
The moral code.

3063
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,640
You're giving us some time.

3064
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,440
That's what you get really mean.

3065
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:28,640
You're giving us some time to reboot or handle it.

3066
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,320
I'm going to use the bathroom then.

3067
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:30,980
Okay, bye.

3068
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,400
Wasn't that something?

3069
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:52,850
That's tough.

3070
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:57,390
Worst case, since the set hasn't started, J will be allowed to sub in as well.

3071
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:57,730
Okay.

3072
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:02,210
Yeah, hopefully Lime can fix it.

3073
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:02,990
That's weird.

3074
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:12,930
A little unfortunate.

3075
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:18,890
But I mean, hopefully it doesn't affect her other games too.

3076
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:21,910
It's just her... Just Marvel Rivals maybe.

3077
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,940
Alright, I'm back.

3078
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:01,940
I wonder what happened when Lime's PC...

3079
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,220
I don't know how much time though we're allowed to have.

3080
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:06,400
I don't know.

3081
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:08,600
We're allowed to put J in.

3082
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,160
We're allowed to put J in, but what do we play with J in?

3083
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:12,940
Just Triple Tank.

3084
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,320
Yeah, but...

3085
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,140
Triple Tank, one DPS...

3086
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:21,460
I mean, if we get the full swap, I can swap the DPS.

3087
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,320
Not that it's good, but I can, you know...

3088
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,040
The Coney DPS, it's time.

3089
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:26,720
Yeah.

3090
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,780
I'm just saying, because if my...

3091
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,940
If my tanks are banned...

3092
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:34,780
And J just plays tank, and then Shoto goes healer...

3093
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:35,560
I could play a DPS.

3094
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:37,800
I don't know if it's going to happen again.

3095
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,720
Okay, so does it start when the game starts or...

3096
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:43,040
No, the second time it started in the lobby.

3097
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,740
Like, it was fucking weird.

3098
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,760
How about we like try... Wait for...

3099
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:48,320
Yeah, go to practice.

3100
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:49,820
Good idea.

3101
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:50,360
Yeah.

3102
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,200
I'm going to start on a practice mode for a second.

3103
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,040
Before we do anything.

3104
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,540
Is it also possible to go into a quick play and then just leave the game too?

3105
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,560
Um, I'm in practice and it's not doing it yet.

3106
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,000
Okay.

3107
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,180
Okay, that's...

3108
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,520
It just scared me that it did it twice in a row.

3109
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,480
Yeah, that was scary.

3110
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:12,120
And like, it was like back to back too.

3111
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:13,540
Yeah.

3112
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:15,040
Literally, it just like...

3113
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,700
It was just robotic distortion and the driver was just fucked.

3114
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:22,140
Surely your computer's not breaking, right?

3115
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:22,820
Surely.

3116
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:22,940
Surely.

3117
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,920
Windows 11 is a robust operating system and all drivers are dead.

3118
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:27,940
Okay.

3119
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,520
Oh, God.

3120
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,120
Oh, gosh.

3121
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:34,000
Okay, well, I'm in the practice round and nothing's happened.

3122
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:34,820
Okay.

3123
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,000
Did it happen?

3124
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:36,420
Okay.

3125
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:37,780
No, no, we're good.

3126
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,820
Oh, I heard the... Oh, and I was like...

3127
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,160
No, nothing's happening right now.

3128
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:44,160
Okay.

3129
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,060
Do we risk it?

3130
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,840
We risk one map, I guess.

3131
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:53,620
I mean, if it all goes horribly wrong, you can just sub Jay in for the rest of it.

3132
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:54,220
Yeah.

3133
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:54,680
Okay.

3134
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:58,380
I don't think they'll allow that because they said it's since the set hasn't started.

3135
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,700
No, no, but like, we can sub in between matches.

3136
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,160
Oh, okay.

3137
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:02,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3138
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:05,280
It'd be crazy to have a sub if you couldn't sub him in.

3139
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:05,840
Yeah.

3140
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,680
We can sub in between matches.

3141
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:08,200
Okay, got it.

3142
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:08,760
Because that's what we've done.

3143
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:09,380
So we're good, we're good.

3144
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,220
As long as the match is over, yeah.

3145
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:12,600
And then...

3146
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:12,900
I'm here.

3147
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,740
If they're going to do that ban line, we just sub Kony out for Jay in the next game.

3148
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:18,780
Yeah.

3149
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:20,320
Works for me.

3150
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,120
I'm ready.

3151
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:22,620
Okay.

3152
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,020
Yep, I'm ready too.

3153
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:24,860
Woo, okay.

3154
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,940
I'm just going to do literally nothing else with my computer.

3155
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:30,660
Just going to sit here and stare at the match screen.

3156
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:31,420
We're going to keep the same bans, right?

3157
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,860
Yeah, keep keeping the same bans.

3158
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,680
So no advantage here.

3159
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,700
I'm not tired.

3160
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:49,440
If it does go, if it does happen, I will let you guys know in chat and just do my best.

3161
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,140
Yeah.

3162
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,440
If you have to, just get on your phone to just at least listen to our comms.

3163
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:54,980
Yeah, to comm.

3164
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:55,720
Yeah, right.

3165
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:56,440
Yeah, that's fair.

3166
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:01,350
We'll just try to communicate more.

3167
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:01,970
Yeah.

3168
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:03,850
To compensate.

3169
01:50:06,570 --> 01:50:08,390
I mean, you should be able to hear me on my phone.

3170
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:09,210
I'll just sound like shit.

3171
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:09,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3172
01:50:10,110 --> 01:50:10,790
It's fine.

3173
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:20,670
Alright, we're just going to wait for them to start the game.

3174
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:25,340
Wow.

3175
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,990
Oh, no.

3176
01:50:39,150 --> 01:50:39,750
Wait, we said.

3177
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:40,210
Oh, no.

3178
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:41,350
What?

3179
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:43,830
I spread the yawn.

3180
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:46,190
Oh, I was going to be like, oh, no.

3181
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:47,110
What do you mean, oh, no?

3182
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:50,410
Cody's yawning now.

3183
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:50,850
It's over.

3184
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:52,430
They're asking if we're ready.

3185
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:54,190
Yeah, we already said it.

3186
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:55,570
Oh, okay.

3187
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:55,910
Yeah.

3188
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:04,320
Alrighty.

3189
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:05,260
Alright.

3190
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:09,240
So, what am I doing with TP here?

3191
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:12,060
Oh, gosh.

3192
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:12,980
Oh, God, it hit me.

3193
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:14,120
Lock in, Gomez.

3194
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,260
What's wrong with you?

3195
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:18,980
I don't like that.

3196
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:19,700
I'm tired.

3197
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,300
You have another tournament after this.

3198
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:22,980
What do you mean you're tired?

3199
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:25,540
Oh, God.

3200
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,580
But it's at four.

3201
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:29,960
Oh, okay.

3202
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:32,340
So, we're keeping the same band line.

3203
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,180
So, you want to TP onto their side.

3204
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,080
Like, towards...

3205
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,140
So, if it's...

3206
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,320
Whatever map we'll get.

3207
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:38,880
I'll tell you where to put it.

3208
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,480
Would it be the opposite high ground?

3209
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:43,600
Yeah.

3210
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,280
From where we spawn?

3211
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:46,300
Yeah.

3212
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:47,340
Okay.

3213
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:50,040
Not the stairs, not the center.

3214
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,900
The balcony kind of thing.

3215
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:52,840
Yep.

3216
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:53,840
Got it.

3217
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,160
I switched out the bands.

3218
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,160
Get rid of the Bucky.

3219
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,720
So, if it's Throne Palace, you want to put it on...

3220
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,360
No, it'll make sense.

3221
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:12,220
So, if it's Garden...

3222
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,420
If it's Garden...

3223
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:14,080
Yeah.

3224
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:16,900
Then you want to put it on their side of the statue.

3225
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:17,900
Or our side of the statue.

3226
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:20,220
It depends on how they do it.

3227
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,840
I think we want to put it on our side of the statue.

3228
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,060
Like, you know what I mean by statue?

3229
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:23,660
Like, the big one?

3230
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,040
The center...

3231
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:28,300
No, no.

3232
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:31,560
The big open area with the huge statue on the right.

3233
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:31,940
Or left.

3234
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:32,540
It's on the right.

3235
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:32,800
Yeah.

3236
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:34,660
Is it up top on it?

3237
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:36,660
Yeah.

3238
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:37,640
Like, right next to it.

3239
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:39,820
Like, next to the statue.

3240
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:40,800
Not all the way at the top of it.

3241
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,540
Like, you know, on top of that big platform.

3242
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:43,460
With the statue.

3243
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,200
So, this time, just DPS.

3244
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:50,460
DPS and just put us on their side.

3245
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:50,800
Opposite balcony.

3246
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:53,560
Oh, not on this one.

3247
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,380
Not on this map.

3248
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:54,920
This is the throne room.

3249
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,300
This is the big-ass chair.

3250
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,540
This is the big-ass throne room.

3251
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:01,100
Yeah.

3252
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:03,740
At the top of the stairs.

3253
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:04,480
Yeah.

3254
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:05,580
Okay, okay.

3255
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:06,340
On their side.

3256
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:08,820
I'm just letting you know I'm still here.

3257
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:09,660
Actually, you know what?

3258
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:10,060
Hold on.

3259
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:10,460
Hold on.

3260
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:11,780
Actually, genius idea.

3261
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:12,760
Take their TP.

3262
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:14,020
Us to their TP.

3263
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,280
Okay.

3264
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:17,240
At the very end.

3265
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:18,060
On the other side.

3266
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,340
All the way onto their side.

3267
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:19,720
Their spawn.

3268
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,460
Go to their spawn.

3269
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,160
Go to their spawn.

3270
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:22,320
Use the TP and go to their spawn.

3271
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:23,200
Use the TP.

3272
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:24,260
Go to their spawn.

3273
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,040
Take their TP and then just...

3274
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:26,480
Full throw.

3275
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:27,080
Full going.

3276
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,520
With this much kind of nonsense that we hear...

3277
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,060
Go to their spawn.

3278
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,600
Go to their spawn.

3279
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:31,180
Their spawn.

3280
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:31,660
Their spawn.

3281
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:32,160
Their spawn.

3282
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:33,760
Okay.

3283
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:34,600
No!

3284
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:34,980
There's nothing!

3285
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,740
Okay, you know what?

3286
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,000
It's fine.

3287
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,800
It's fine.

3288
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:37,160
I'm lost.

3289
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:37,720
I'm lost.

3290
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:39,680
Okay, it's fine.

3291
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,160
Storm should be an easy kill for me.

3292
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:43,800
If we can.

3293
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:44,380
Storm is split.

3294
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:44,880
Storm is split.

3295
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:46,720
I'm going with you.

3296
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:48,740
Walking.

3297
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,220
Storm's low.

3298
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:50,640
Storm's low.

3299
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:51,040
Yeah, yeah.

3300
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:52,200
I'm on their supports right now.

3301
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:54,780
Their supports are low.

3302
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,440
Their supports are low.

3303
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:56,800
Are they?

3304
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:57,860
Come to me again.

3305
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,160
Come to me.

3306
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,000
Oh, they flashed me now.

3307
01:53:59,460 --> 01:53:59,940
Stab me again.

3308
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:00,520
Stab me again.

3309
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:05,100
Oh my god, I got caught off.

3310
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:05,780
Okay.

3311
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:06,820
Dwarf's out.

3312
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:08,220
Or Hulk's out, sorry.

3313
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,160
We have Strange on us.

3314
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:17,660
I mean, I got full coverage behind them.

3315
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,210
Yeah, I'm trying to...

3316
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:19,740
Oh my gosh.

3317
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,940
Go for their...

3318
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:24,060
Go for their Storm.

3319
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:25,920
Never mind, that character's broken.

3320
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:27,960
Oh my god.

3321
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,200
Oh my god, don't kill me!

3322
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:29,880
Yeah, I couldn't.

3323
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,060
I couldn't heal you.

3324
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:32,940
Wait, is he stupid?

3325
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:33,920
Wait, what is he doing?

3326
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:35,640
He doesn't know you have Rez.

3327
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:38,480
Strange, Strange, Strange, Strange, Strange, Strange!

3328
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:43,590
Stick to the moves.

3329
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:45,690
We have Luna ult, we have Luna copy.

3330
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:47,610
We can do the Luna ult.

3331
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:48,750
Oh, I'm not using it yet.

3332
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,410
I'm using it now?

3333
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:51,310
Alright, yeah, we're on.

3334
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:52,810
Walking hard, walking hard.

3335
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:54,410
Let me know when damage boost, if you need it.

3336
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:55,710
Damage boost?

3337
01:54:57,650 --> 01:54:58,670
I'm ulting, I'm ulting here.

3338
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:01,710
No more ults, no more ults, no more ults.

3339
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:03,290
I'm killing Storm.

3340
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:03,810
Storm's down.

3341
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:04,910
Hulk, Hulk on me!

3342
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,110
Yeah, Hulk.

3343
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:07,810
Nice.

3344
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:10,210
Nice, I gotta lower my sens.

3345
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:12,810
Oh, we have to, we have to stagger him next time.

3346
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:14,310
Because we capped it.

3347
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:16,950
I'm giving the orb to Gomez.

3348
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:19,130
Do they have Luna ult?

3349
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:20,170
They have Luna ult, yeah.

3350
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:20,770
They do, they do.

3351
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:21,690
We use cloaked only.

3352
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:22,070
Alright.

3353
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:23,710
So, we can either...

3354
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:26,790
We use either Gomez ult or your ult to drag a Luna ult up.

3355
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:29,970
Which ult first?

3356
01:55:30,210 --> 01:55:30,750
Who ults first?

3357
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:32,650
I can ult first.

3358
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:34,570
Actually, no, Coney, you ult first to force out their Luna ult.

3359
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:35,150
Yeah, okay.

3360
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:36,490
Oh my god, I'm getting...

3361
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:37,830
Actually, do it around this corner if you can.

3362
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:38,970
Oh, never mind, never mind.

3363
01:55:39,190 --> 01:55:40,490
That's alright, that's good, that's good, that's good.

3364
01:55:40,510 --> 01:55:40,950
You can save it for yourself.

3365
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:42,530
Hulk is on me, Hulk is on me.

3366
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:43,230
I'm backing up.

3367
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:45,670
Don't do anything, just contest.

3368
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:47,470
You have res, you do.

3369
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:49,570
I do, I'm already dead, but I'm gonna...

3370
01:55:50,290 --> 01:55:51,890
It's fine, they all focus me.

3371
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:53,430
It's winnable, it's winnable, winnable.

3372
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:54,170
It's winnable, winnable.

3373
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:55,490
Point, fight on point if you have to.

3374
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:57,710
I'm one, I'm one.

3375
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:01,710
Very good, very good.

3376
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:02,470
I'm reviving, I'm reviving.

3377
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:02,730
Yep.

3378
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:03,870
Good shit.

3379
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:05,750
No, don't kill him, don't kill him, don't kill him, don't kill him.

3380
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:07,910
Stagger, stagger, don't kill him, don't kill him, don't kill him, don't kill him.

3381
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:12,350
Yeah, jump off the map, bitch.

3382
01:56:17,290 --> 01:56:19,270
Okay, so now we have...

3383
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:21,870
We have Luna ult coming up, then we can combo that maybe.

3384
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:23,430
Yeah, wait for me, wait for me, wait for me.

3385
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:27,530
Or actually, Han, you and Kony can do a combo.

3386
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:34,530
Kony, just, whenever you slam into them, ult, don't press the left click and just slow them and let Shadow get a free...

3387
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:35,790
Got it, so just slam Q.

3388
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:36,670
Got it, yep.

3389
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:37,910
I'm gonna wait for them to walk in.

3390
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:40,950
And then time the slam, time your ult with his slam, okay?

3391
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:41,770
Got it, alright.

3392
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:44,290
Before it lands, before the wave lands, okay?

3393
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:45,630
Hold on, I'm waiting for them to walk in.

3394
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:46,650
Go here, yeah, go here.

3395
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:47,450
Got it, going.

3396
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,950
Okay, look at the backline, and hit.

3397
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:51,930
I got their Luna.

3398
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,210
Luna dead, Luna dead, Luna dead.

3399
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:53,930
I need heals, I need heals here.

3400
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:55,470
I got your back, I got your back.

3401
01:56:58,030 --> 01:56:59,210
Straight kill me, I'm already dead.

3402
01:56:59,230 --> 01:56:59,790
We have Luna ult, we have Luna ult.

3403
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:00,110
I'm dead.

3404
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:00,710
I'm dead.

3405
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:02,690
It's fine, it's fine, we can toss this.

3406
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,610
We can win this, actually, hold on, wait.

3407
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:08,030
Oh, I don't have ice, I don't have ice.

3408
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:09,210
Wait, get the stream, stream, stream, stream.

3409
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:10,150
Change, change, change, change.

3410
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:10,790
You're alive, you're alive.

3411
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:12,450
3, 2, 1.

3412
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:15,470
I have both, I have Exhaust.

3413
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:15,790
Need more up.

3414
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:18,650
There's a Luna behind you guys.

3415
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:21,750
Oh, he's got the full heal.

3416
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:22,770
I got him.

3417
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:23,950
We can win this, we can win this.

3418
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:27,150
Nice.

3419
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:28,710
I'm exiled.

3420
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:30,930
I got rolled by turrets, unlucky.

3421
01:57:31,390 --> 01:57:32,630
Alright, we can still win this, we can still win this.

3422
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:35,010
I misplayed my ult, I didn't know how it worked.

3423
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:35,610
It was bad.

3424
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,790
It's fine.

3425
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:38,170
We can win this next.

3426
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:38,750
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

3427
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:39,630
No heals, no heals.

3428
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:40,350
Sorry, sorry.

3429
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,890
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

3430
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:43,830
He's dead.

3431
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:45,330
He can die here.

3432
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:46,370
I got him, got him, got him.

3433
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:47,230
Got him.

3434
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:48,190
Shit.

3435
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:49,230
I'm hiding, I'm hiding.

3436
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:50,290
I'm hiding, I'm hiding too.

3437
01:57:50,290 --> 01:57:52,210
He has snap, he has snap.

3438
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:52,550
Use it, use it.

3439
01:57:53,290 --> 01:57:53,990
Cap it, cap it.

3440
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:55,430
I couldn't, I couldn't.

3441
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:56,170
I got it.

3442
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:58,150
Do you want me to rez?

3443
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3444
01:57:59,290 --> 01:57:59,710
I'm on Luna, I'm on Luna.

3445
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:00,370
No, no, no.

3446
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:00,770
Okay.

3447
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:02,210
As soon as the tank dies, you rez.

3448
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:03,190
I'll go get Luna ulted.

3449
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:04,690
Okay.

3450
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:05,730
Looking for me.

3451
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:06,050
It's fine.

3452
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:10,170
Okay, we have Namorul coming in.

3453
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:12,190
I have ult here, I have ult here.

3454
01:58:12,190 --> 01:58:12,590
I'll heal a little bit.

3455
01:58:12,650 --> 01:58:12,930
Low.

3456
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:15,170
Luna should be next kill.

3457
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,830
Nevermind, looking frontline.

3458
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:18,590
She's one, killer's one.

3459
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:19,130
Hulk on me.

3460
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:20,450
She's one, she's one.

3461
01:58:20,590 --> 01:58:20,850
Oh my god, oh my god.

3462
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:21,750
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

3463
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:23,890
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

3464
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:25,050
Oh my god, I'm onto Namor.

3465
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:25,710
Namor can die here.

3466
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:26,890
I got him, got him.

3467
01:58:27,010 --> 01:58:27,630
Oh my god.

3468
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:28,610
Woo!

3469
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:29,430
Nice.

3470
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:32,150
Nice.

3471
01:58:33,150 --> 01:58:35,350
I get to play Starlord, oh my god.

3472
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:37,350
Oh my god.

3473
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:38,630
Oh my god.

3474
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:39,650
I'm so happy.

3475
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:41,150
It better be the open map.

3476
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:42,830
Okay, so Kony, you're ult.

3477
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:45,930
Whenever you're in the floor, you slow them, right?

3478
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:47,770
So you funnel really long slow.

3479
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:51,390
And your ult is based off percentage of their health.

3480
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:57,110
So if you ult before the whale lands, you basically get rid of half their HP, or over half their HP.

3481
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:59,130
And as soon as the whale lands, you one shot them.

3482
01:58:59,570 --> 01:59:01,990
No, I fucked it up because I didn't realize.

3483
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:04,770
I tried to slam ult, and I did Q.

3484
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:07,370
Like, Q interrupts the slam.

3485
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:08,510
You know what I'm saying?

3486
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:11,850
So it was like, I was in midair, and I did Q, and then he popped Q.

3487
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:12,790
Okay, real quick.

3488
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:13,950
Yeah, wait for my whale.

3489
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:14,610
Wait for my whale.

3490
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,870
How am I doing TP here?

3491
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:17,710
So TP...

3492
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:19,450
Okay, do the same thing.

3493
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:22,830
Except this time, go all the way into their spawn.

3494
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,210
Like, all the way into their spawn.

3495
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:25,070
Like, where they're portaling.

3496
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,030
Where they're portaling.

3497
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:29,810
Like, the other side of where they're living.

3498
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,090
All the way to their spawn.

3499
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:32,050
All the way to their spawn.

3500
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,330
Like, leave some gaps so we don't do it.

3501
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:36,150
I don't understand.

3502
01:59:37,110 --> 01:59:37,650
All the way.

3503
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:39,170
All the way at their spawn.

3504
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:39,850
Where they're portaling.

3505
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:40,990
Their spawn room.

3506
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:41,610
Their spawn room.

3507
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:42,070
They're not portaling?

3508
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:42,430
Oh.

3509
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:44,010
Okay, go back.

3510
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:44,710
I'm spawning on point.

3511
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:45,390
I'm spawning on point.

3512
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:45,970
I don't know.

3513
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:46,150
Okay.

3514
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:47,530
Wait, you're fine.

3515
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:48,730
Oh, they're on Wolverine.

3516
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:50,110
Okay.

3517
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:51,950
I don't know what Wolverine's gonna do against us.

3518
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:53,510
I don't know either.

3519
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:53,850
He's gonna have to throw.

3520
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:54,290
He's throwing.

3521
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:54,970
He's planning on throwing it.

3522
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,350
I'm bored.

3523
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:55,650
I'm ulting.

3524
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:56,410
He's throwing.

3525
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:57,830
He's throwing.

3526
01:59:58,410 --> 01:59:58,690
I'm...

3527
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,150
Hulk can die.

3528
01:59:59,230 --> 01:59:59,530
Hulk can die.

3529
01:59:59,590 --> 01:59:59,970
Hulk is dead.

3530
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:01,150
Wolf hurt.

3531
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:02,050
Wolf what?

3532
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:02,430
Hulk is dead.

3533
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:03,290
I'm on.

3534
02:00:03,830 --> 02:00:04,170
It's fine.

3535
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:05,930
Strange, strange, strange one.

3536
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:06,470
Strange one.

3537
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:07,190
Strange one.

3538
02:00:07,190 --> 02:00:08,510
Strange one, strange one.

3539
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:08,590
Yup.

3540
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:10,010
Yup, nice.

3541
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:12,950
Cloak one.

3542
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:15,270
I got Luna here.

3543
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:15,710
Cloak.

3544
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:16,590
Okay.

3545
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:18,890
Just one.

3546
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:20,630
Namor, Namor, Namor.

3547
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:21,790
Namor's in our spawn.

3548
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:22,410
Nice.

3549
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:22,950
Good shit.

3550
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:27,110
Okay, I have my ult.

3551
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:30,750
I'm chilling up here when they walk out.

3552
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:31,630
I have ult too.

3553
02:00:32,150 --> 02:00:33,030
If they pop out...

3554
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,190
I have another ult.

3555
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:33,490
Wait for Namor.

3556
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:34,370
Wait for our Shoda ult.

3557
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:35,030
Wait for Shoda ult.

3558
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:36,030
Okay.

3559
02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:37,430
Shoda has his soon.

3560
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:39,630
Alright, I'm gonna wait for them to walk through.

3561
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:40,690
Hulk's below.

3562
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:41,230
They're below, okay.

3563
02:00:41,490 --> 02:00:41,830
I'm holding.

3564
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,150
Okay, we have our Shoda ult.

3565
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:47,090
Yeah, I'm waiting.

3566
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:47,870
Okay.

3567
02:00:48,430 --> 02:00:48,790
I'm on point.

3568
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:49,770
I'm on point with you guys.

3569
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:50,110
Going.

3570
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:50,690

3571
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:53,750
It's fine, it's fine.

3572
02:00:53,790 --> 02:00:54,270
I have my ult.

3573
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:55,130
You just need to combo mine.

3574
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:55,870
Yeah, I'm waiting for yours.

3575
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:56,410
I'm waiting for yours.

3576
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:57,330
I was gonna die.

3577
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:57,830
I need to shit.

3578
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:58,550
I used mine.

3579
02:00:58,650 --> 02:00:59,310
I misplayed it.

3580
02:00:59,590 --> 02:00:59,710
Ready?

3581
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,470
We can rez.

3582
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:01,210
Okay, I'm ulting.

3583
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:01,410
I'm ulting.

3584
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:01,690
Right here.

3585
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:01,970
Right here.

3586
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:03,650
Nice.

3587
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:04,090
Huge.

3588
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:05,690
Good shit.

3589
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:08,870
That's fine.

3590
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:09,290
That's fine.

3591
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:10,270
You only got Venom.

3592
02:01:10,370 --> 02:01:10,710
That's fine.

3593
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:11,310
That's fine.

3594
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:11,610
We got him.

3595
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:11,910
We got him.

3596
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:13,330
I got Wolf.

3597
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:13,650
It's fine.

3598
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:14,030
It's fine.

3599
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,210
No need for...

3600
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:17,150
Do you want me to ult or are we good?

3601
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:17,810
No, we're good.

3602
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:18,110
We're good.

3603
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:20,770
It's just Wolverine and Hulk.

3604
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:20,990
Got him.

3605
02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:22,190
No need to use it.

3606
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:24,450
No more on point.

3607
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:25,010
What the?

3608
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:25,870
Oh, he's dead.

3609
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:28,510
He was fighting me and losing, so he jumped down and died.

3610
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:29,610
I'm sorry.

3611
02:01:29,730 --> 02:01:32,250
I could not ult because I had to shift to get healed.

3612
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:32,990
I was so low.

3613
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:35,670
Dude, I fucked up my Venom ult again, so it's fine.

3614
02:01:35,870 --> 02:01:36,730
Portal on the right.

3615
02:01:37,650 --> 02:01:38,270
The portal one.

3616
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:38,750
Yeah.

3617
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:39,290
We're on point.

3618
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:40,270
We're getting point.

3619
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:41,350
We're getting point.

3620
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:42,510
Why did we get point?

3621
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:43,250
Why did we get point?

3622
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:44,250
Oh, shit.

3623
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:45,190
We may have C9.

3624
02:01:46,450 --> 02:01:47,130
Okay, we got him.

3625
02:01:48,330 --> 02:01:49,010
I'm on there, Luna.

3626
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:51,570
On their heals.

3627
02:01:51,670 --> 02:01:52,310
Their heals are so low.

3628
02:01:52,330 --> 02:01:53,190
Their heals are so low back here.

3629
02:01:53,290 --> 02:01:53,550
I'm on them.

3630
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:53,810
I'm on them.

3631
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:54,470
I'm on them.

3632
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:56,430
I'm on them.

3633
02:01:56,430 --> 02:01:56,910
String dead.

3634
02:01:57,410 --> 02:01:58,270
Go, go, go, go, go.

3635
02:01:58,270 --> 02:01:58,790
Just focus ult.

3636
02:01:59,830 --> 02:02:00,670
He's getting solid.

3637
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:01,070
Watch this.

3638
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:01,770
Watch this.

3639
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:02,290
Oh, shit.

3640
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,470
Put your fingers in his ass.

3641
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:04,770
What?

3642
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:07,770
He's like, fuck you in particular.

3643
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:08,870
They have no portal.

3644
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:09,490
They have no portal.

3645
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:11,390
Yeah, we can push up.

3646
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:12,990
Yup, push it up.

3647
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:14,710
I'm about to have ult up again.

3648
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:16,250
Okay.

3649
02:02:18,570 --> 02:02:19,490
We have shuttle ult here.

3650
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:20,190
We have shuttle ult here.

3651
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,550
Wolf behind you.

3652
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:22,930
I see that.

3653
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:24,690
Wait for shuttle ult.

3654
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:25,550
Wait for shuttle ult, Ken.

3655
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:27,290
I think we just save point.

3656
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:27,570
I have ult.

3657
02:02:27,790 --> 02:02:28,330
Stay on point.

3658
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:29,550
I have ult too.

3659
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:30,090
Stay on point.

3660
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:30,770
Stranger's here.

3661
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:31,670
Stranger's here by himself.

3662
02:02:31,990 --> 02:02:33,110
What the fuck?

3663
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:34,010
What the hell?

3664
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,230
I'm ulting to get lineup.

3665
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:35,650
There.

3666
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:38,770
Oh, fuck.

3667
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:39,370
I hit them.

3668
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:39,650
I hit them.

3669
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:40,150
I died.

3670
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:41,510
Do we rez him or no?

3671
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:42,850
Rez him, rez him, rez him.

3672
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:43,390
This is the last fight.

3673
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:43,930
This is the last fight.

3674
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:46,950
I need heal.

3675
02:02:47,010 --> 02:02:47,270
I need heal.

3676
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:49,710
Oh my gosh.

3677
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,950
What?

3678
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:51,290
I'm one.

3679
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:54,770
Shooting their Luna.

3680
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:56,250
I don't care about waiting.

3681
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:58,070
I got all here.

3682
02:02:58,290 --> 02:02:59,010
Oh, I got picked up.

3683
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:00,390
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3684
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:01,990
Wolverine one.

3685
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:03,750
I'm damage boosting you.

3686
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:04,770
I got froze.

3687
02:03:04,970 --> 02:03:05,450
I got frozen.

3688
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:06,530
You're okay, you're okay.

3689
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:07,290
Damage boost.

3690
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:10,010
Unleash the Vishanti's power.

3691
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:10,810
Nice.

3692
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:11,590
Nice.

3693
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:12,170
Nice.

3694
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:12,750
I love that.

3695
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:13,430
Good shit.

3696
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:14,690
Good shit, guys.

3697
02:03:15,390 --> 02:03:17,250
That's what they get for giving us Starlord.

3698
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:18,610
Yay.

3699
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:19,970
And I'm never gonna be able to play.

3700
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:22,750
I was gonna say, my Venom is ass, but the Starlord is picking it up.

3701
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:25,790
Yeah, I was gonna say, they're not gonna let that happen again.

3702
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:30,190
Holy shit, I just have this low-level anxiety that any moment now, my audio is gonna go up.

3703
02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:31,030
Just don't think about it.

3704
02:03:31,210 --> 02:03:32,970
It was like double nerves.

3705
02:03:36,210 --> 02:03:37,790
Do we bench Coney, though?

3706
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:40,690
After that bandwagon, should we keep it in case they do Starlord?

3707
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:44,950
I mean, I'm pretty...

3708
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:48,870
I felt like I was ass, but the stats are okay.

3709
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:49,630
You did okay.

3710
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:50,170
You did good.

3711
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:56,470
I just fucked up my combos, so I didn't get the shit with Shoto, but that's my fault.

3712
02:03:57,210 --> 02:03:59,190
I'm down to be benched if you guys wanna put Jay in.

3713
02:03:59,230 --> 02:03:59,690
Your guy's call.

3714
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:00,970
Gomez.

3715
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:02,430
Your call.

3716
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:03,730
You're the main IGL.

3717
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:08,050
If we think we're fine, keep me in.

3718
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:10,830
They're gonna ban Starlord, so we get Thing.

3719
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:14,850
They can't get both.

3720
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:16,670
They can't get both, yeah.

3721
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:18,350
I mean, they could.

3722
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:20,350
They could if they want to, but...

3723
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:24,510
I get Meg, he gets Strange.

3724
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:27,630
I'm comfortable on Meg.

3725
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:30,110
I'm fine with either.

3726
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:32,350
I'm fine on Meg, I'm just not...

3727
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:33,310
I don't know.

3728
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:36,410
Just keep me in.

3729
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:41,130
I'm either gonna get Thing or Meg.

3730
02:04:41,230 --> 02:04:42,090
They're gonna kill Starlord.

3731
02:04:42,530 --> 02:04:43,530
I get Thing or Meg.

3732
02:04:43,630 --> 02:04:43,870
It's fine.

3733
02:04:44,330 --> 02:04:45,310
Okay, sounds good.

3734
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:51,590
The reason they picked me out is because I can't play... I play Thing, Meg, Strange.

3735
02:04:51,890 --> 02:04:53,370
But we're gonna get one of them.

3736
02:04:54,490 --> 02:04:54,750
Alright.

3737
02:04:55,170 --> 02:04:58,370
Or we get Starlord and that happens again.

3738
02:04:58,510 --> 02:04:58,850
It's fine.

3739
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:03,920
Okay, I'm ready.

3740
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,580
Alright, let's go.

3741
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:12,290
I had my fun one game for the tournament.

3742
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:17,750
The one tournament you actually get to play Starlord.

3743
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:19,490
The one time.

3744
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:22,050
I'm back to jail.

3745
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:25,750
Also, I thought we couldn't change during the set.

3746
02:05:25,910 --> 02:05:26,810
Like, once the set starts.

3747
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:31,730
Well, we were able... It says we can if... I read the thing and they said you can change it.

3748
02:05:31,730 --> 02:05:34,670
As not, like, in between matches and stuff.

3749
02:05:35,710 --> 02:05:37,990
I don't think that would even work, would it?

3750
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:38,910
Yeah, it wouldn't work.

3751
02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:39,970
Yeah, how would you even do that?

3752
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:40,930
Yeah, how would you even do that?

3753
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:45,830
We did that during, like, casted things too.

3754
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:48,110
We did that during casted matches as well.

3755
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:50,370
Hello?

3756
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:51,550
Hi.

3757
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,970
Hello?

3758
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:55,130
Okay, Discord says I have 600 ping.

3759
02:05:55,550 --> 02:05:55,970
What?

3760
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:57,030
I don't know what's happening.

3761
02:05:58,290 --> 02:06:00,370
Go to practice range.

3762
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:06,610
I can't believe they're sending viruses to our computers in real time.

3763
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:09,870
They don't want us to win.

3764
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:11,170
No chat, no internet, no vision.

3765
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:14,330
They don't want us to win.

3766
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:16,150
Is it okay now?

3767
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:16,910
Is your Discord okay?

3768
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:20,350
Uh, nope, still at 600 for some reason.

3769
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:21,650
Restart Discord.

3770
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:26,330
Well, you're responding in good time and if your ping is okay in game, it should be fine.

3771
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:28,250
Is your ping in game okay?

3772
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:28,650
Yeah.

3773
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:29,650
Restart your Discord.

3774
02:06:30,730 --> 02:06:31,850
Yeah, let me do that.

3775
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,650
Did you check your ping?

3776
02:06:36,290 --> 02:06:38,930
I didn't even check his ping on practice range before.

3777
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:42,750
I mean, you can actually, if you click the servers, it'll tell you on the top, right?

3778
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:44,290
It'll tell you your ping to each one.

3779
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:45,530
That's true.

3780
02:06:46,910 --> 02:06:47,570
It's at 31.

3781
02:06:47,870 --> 02:06:48,330
Oh, okay.

3782
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:49,550
We just have to restart Discord.

3783
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:52,020
Let me restart Discord.

3784
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:54,970
Okay, I'll get you in.

3785
02:06:59,490 --> 02:07:02,150
One more game and we're in finals.

3786
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:04,230
We're in semis.

3787
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:07,930
I almost got excited there.

3788
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:09,670
Like, this is it?

3789
02:07:09,910 --> 02:07:11,710
One more to top three.

3790
02:07:13,190 --> 02:07:13,910
Okay, okay.

3791
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:16,770
No, no, we need two to top three.

3792
02:07:17,610 --> 02:07:17,970
Really?

3793
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:22,370
Yeah, because if we lose semis, we go to loser bracket and then we have to fight loser bracket.

3794
02:07:23,110 --> 02:07:23,710
They get to...

3795
02:07:25,250 --> 02:07:25,690
Is it?

3796
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:26,090
I can't tell.

3797
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:27,610
Yeah, yeah, we have to fight for third.

3798
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:28,910
I think it's third place, yeah.

3799
02:07:29,490 --> 02:07:32,110
No, we're guaranteed fifth now.

3800
02:07:33,150 --> 02:07:33,630
Yeah, it's fifth.

3801
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:35,730
I've done enough Smash tournaments to know we're top eight.

3802
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:38,770
So, it's winners bracket, our side, we're guaranteed fifth.

3803
02:07:38,930 --> 02:07:39,350
Yeah, yeah.

3804
02:07:41,950 --> 02:07:44,430
I mean, out of 100 plus teams, that's pretty good.

3805
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:47,010
128 teams, I think, yeah.

3806
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:47,630
It's not bad.

3807
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:51,310
Why?

3808
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:53,530
This might have broken things for Gomez.

3809
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:54,510
What?

3810
02:08:00,270 --> 02:08:02,450
He's probably stuck connecting, you know, when you try and join.

3811
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:04,710
He sits on yellow and it's like...

3812
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:08,640
Maybe...

3813
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:10,120
Oh, we actually, we can't switch out.

3814
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:14,480
He's like, remember to have the team, you start the set with the same each game, so no switches can happen until the new set.

3815
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:15,420
So...

3816
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:15,820
Yeah, that's...

3817
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:17,980
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

3818
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:18,760
That's what I was saying.

3819
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:20,560
They let us do it yesterday.

3820
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:23,260
It matches that we're casted.

3821
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:26,520
Oh, Gomez should be able to join now.

3822
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:27,360
It says he was at max.

3823
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:31,140
Hello?

3824
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,440
Hey, what's up?

3825
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,040
Is it still 600?

3826
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,420
Bro, who are these government agents?

3827
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:38,760
Yeah.

3828
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:42,760
They ruined the audio of all of our members.

3829
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:44,620
Wait, hold on.

3830
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,440
Let me rejoin them back.

3831
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:45,860
Hold on.

3832
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,620
Are you at 600 ping?

3833
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:51,040
It's at 120.

3834
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,020
I think it's the servers in the Discord.

3835
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:53,940
Oh, Discord servers.

3836
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:54,720
Maybe they can swap.

3837
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:57,720
Yeah, it'd be like, can you swap the region of the server?

3838
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,380
Or RVC.

3839
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,640
I think RVC.

3840
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,080
Are we like robots for you?

3841
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:04,280
No.

3842
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:06,120
Wait, just to make sure.

3843
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:07,280
Can you hover over the...

3844
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,760
I mean, I'm green.

3845
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:11,900
I'm frightened to fucking tap out of this game.

3846
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:12,780
I'm at 14 MS.

3847
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:13,560
So we're in Europe.

3848
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:14,660
Oh, we're in Europe.

3849
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,500
That's an okay ping.

3850
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,360
So I think you're fine.

3851
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:18,440
Okay.

3852
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:22,180
Wait, did you put Europe in RVC?

3853
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,600
Yeah.

3854
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:25,200
I don't think it really matters.

3855
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:25,900
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

3856
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:26,660
That's crazy.

3857
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,340
I didn't even realize that.

3858
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:30,420
I didn't check my...

3859
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:32,500
Yeah, I'm at 140 MS.

3860
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:33,060
The fuck?

3861
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:35,180
Yeah, you guys have been at that all the time.

3862
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:37,480
Why the fuck are we in Europe for RVC?

3863
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,740
What are they asking me?

3864
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:41,200
Wait, wait.

3865
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:43,680
Who are you, if you don't mind asking?

3866
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,500
He's Vgarbisbibis.

3867
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,240
Do they think I'm a random?

3868
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,880
Like question mark?

3869
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,120
What?

3870
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:02,780
They don't know who this person is that's on our team.

3871
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:04,420
Bro, what?

3872
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,920
The Vgarbisbibis.

3873
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:06,840
That's all you need to know.

3874
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:08,440
Dude, I've flown off the radar today.

3875
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:10,340
No one knows who you are, Battle.

3876
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:10,880
What happened?

3877
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:17,740
Wait, do you think that happened the entire tourney?

3878
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:18,420
I don't know.

3879
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,200
I don't know.

3880
02:10:19,380 --> 02:10:22,480
Did people think you were Vgarbisbibis?

3881
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,840
Are we ready?

3882
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:26,460
Oh, wait.

3883
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:26,740
Oh, wait.

3884
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:27,180
We're ready.

3885
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:28,300
Oh, wait.

3886
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:28,900
Let me fix this.

3887
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:30,120
Wait, are we not?

3888
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:30,960
We're not ready, apparently.

3889
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:32,020
Okay, let me know when you're ready.

3890
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:33,180
I'm ready.

3891
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:33,760
Okay.

3892
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,280
Okay.

3893
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,440
I'm ready.

3894
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:37,180
Yeah.

3895
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:39,220
I can't believe you just got hoomegalo'd.

3896
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:40,480
It's a stream war.

3897
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:43,320
That was the server changing.

3898
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,120
They swapped it.

3899
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:45,080
They swapped it.

3900
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:49,200
I will enjoy my 100 MS ping.

3901
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:50,360
That shit was scary.

3902
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:50,860
Dang.

3903
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:52,960
Alright, one more.

3904
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:53,320
One more.

3905
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:53,800
One more.

3906
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,760
Use Discord on NA servers.

3907
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,680
I may as well be American.

3908
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:56,800
Big game.

3909
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:57,320
Big game.

3910
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:57,820
Big game.

3911
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,980
Oh my god, I'm 66 MS.

3912
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:01,740
I have my ping.

3913
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:03,520
Oh god.

3914
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:05,960
Are we ready?

3915
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:07,240
Yep.

3916
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:11,700
That was a new rule change.

3917
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:14,700
Because, like, before they were saying we can't do that.

3918
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,660
They didn't stop us yesterday.

3919
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:18,820
Like...

3920
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:19,040
No.

3921
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:20,660
I think we swapped it.

3922
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,280
Oh, no, you're right.

3923
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:23,600
Yeah, they didn't stop us.

3924
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,280
And we were on official, like, we were streaming.

3925
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,200
We did it in games.

3926
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:26,740
You're right.

3927
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:27,140
Yeah.

3928
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,280
Yeah.

3929
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:35,360
We were just waiting for them to start.

3930
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:36,600
Yep.

3931
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:37,700
Oh, wait.

3932
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:38,620
I thought we said we were ready.

3933
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:39,240
Yeah.

3934
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:40,560
Wait, we did.

3935
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:41,860
We just... I said...

3936
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:43,260
Yeah, I'll just say it again.

3937
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,840
They don't want to hear it from anyone other than Shoto.

3938
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:49,200
Yeah, they're just like...

3939
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:51,460
Shoto does the bad lines, so like...

3940
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:51,920
Shush.

3941
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:54,320
Captain Shoto.

3942
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,140
Oh, hell no.

3943
02:12:00,730 --> 02:12:02,390
Maybe if we win this, I can get ducked today.

3944
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:05,650
Alright, we gotta lock in.

3945
02:12:05,650 --> 02:12:07,850
That would be a reward for winning the whole tournament, is duck.

3946
02:12:09,010 --> 02:12:11,990
Okay, we're in Tokyo, 29... The Spider Islands.

3947
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:13,190
Or this one.

3948
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:14,630
Is that the one with the dojo?

3949
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:18,170
Is this the one where we capture the point first?

3950
02:12:18,370 --> 02:12:18,610
Or...

3951
02:12:18,610 --> 02:12:19,770
No, no, that's the one where we put...

3952
02:12:19,770 --> 02:12:20,270
This is the...

3953
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:21,450
Is it dojo or thing?

3954
02:12:21,890 --> 02:12:22,350
It's dojo.

3955
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:23,030
Oh, I like this one.

3956
02:12:23,110 --> 02:12:23,550
It's dojo.

3957
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:25,010
It's where we push.

3958
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:26,090
Yeah.

3959
02:12:28,010 --> 02:12:31,210
This is gonna be fun for Black Panther, though, I think.

3960
02:12:32,470 --> 02:12:33,790
There's a lot of high ground here.

3961
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:36,370
Are Black Panther and Magic...

3962
02:12:36,370 --> 02:12:38,550
Yeah, we always ban Magic, though.

3963
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:40,810
So we'll probably have to deal with Black Panther in this map.

3964
02:12:41,490 --> 02:12:43,450
They say Panther, they didn't play it last time.

3965
02:12:43,450 --> 02:12:44,430
Yeah, they didn't play him.

3966
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,930
I'm gonna go Wolf again, but that did nothing.

3967
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:49,870
Yeah, that was weird.

3968
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:50,490
I was like, why would...

3969
02:12:50,490 --> 02:12:54,850
I mean, they got three of us in that one fight, but it didn't matter because they lost their...

3970
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:55,230
Yeah.

3971
02:12:55,370 --> 02:12:57,110
Yeah, we had, like, heals.

3972
02:12:58,970 --> 02:12:59,950
I lost to a turret.

3973
02:13:00,670 --> 02:13:01,110
Yeah.

3974
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:12,030
Are we ready?

3975
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:12,790
Yeah.

3976
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:15,510
They said ready, like, two times.

3977
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:17,610
So I think you're setting up the casting.

3978
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:18,710
Okay.

3979
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:25,580
Coney, can you do a good toad voice?

3980
02:13:28,660 --> 02:13:30,200
It's easy to do a toad voice!

3981
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:32,160
The new one, that's easy!

3982
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,280
Oh, well, y'all just did it.

3983
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:35,500
It's really simple.

3984
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:38,160
Or you could do the one from the movie.

3985
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:40,720
With the Keegan-Michael Keys, like that.

3986
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:43,160
Do you know how to sing with a toad voice, too?

3987
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:44,340
Yeah, can you sing with a toad voice?

3988
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:45,640
No, I don't.

3989
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:46,520
Not for free.

3990
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:48,820
Oh, does that mean...

3991
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:51,580
Hey, guys, in Coney's chat, they'll do a full sub.

3992
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:52,660
Five?

3993
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:54,320
You think I'm sticking for five?

3994
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:55,180
How many gifted?

3995
02:13:56,460 --> 02:13:56,740
How many?

3996
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,320
I mean, I'm in a bit of a decay right now.

3997
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:01,360
Can we get...

3998
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,580
400 subs, I think.

3999
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:05,340
400?!

4000
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:07,280
I think 400 is clear.

4001
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,880
I better be getting, like, a fucking musical if I'm here.

4002
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,160
You guys are VTubers.

4003
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:14,160
You got it, bro.

4004
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:15,120
Look at the audience.

4005
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:21,380
Hey, you know how the rich say rich?

4006
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,460
Let's give this Fleshtuber five subs.

4007
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:28,240
Okay, man.

4008
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:29,000
Awesome.

4009
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:33,440
It's gotta be Starlord, though.

4010
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,240
It's gotta be Starlord.

4011
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:35,480
It's gotta be Starlord.

4012
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:36,400
There's no way.

4013
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:37,820
You literally got 40.

4014
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:38,320
Yeah.

4015
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:40,680
Thank you.

4016
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:41,820
Thank you.

4017
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:41,960
Thank you.

4018
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:42,640
Hilarious.

4019
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:43,680
Keep thing.

4020
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:44,260
Keep thing.

4021
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:44,640
Magic.

4022
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:48,580
Save me from Venom jail.

4023
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:50,380
Protect the thing.

4024
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:51,160
Protect the thing.

4025
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:52,180
Yeah, protect the thing.

4026
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:53,340
Protect the thing.

4027
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:55,160
Thank you.

4028
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:55,820
Hilarious.

4029
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:57,180
They learned their lesson.

4030
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,480
Yeah, I'm not worried about VP with this.

4031
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:02,560
That's so funny.

4032
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:05,700
I don't get to play my character.

4033
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:08,900
You literally got 40 kills in two rounds.

4034
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:13,120
That's ass, though.

4035
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:14,700
If we have thing...

4036
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,080
Okay, not thing.

4037
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:19,760
Yeah, you're fine against Wolverine.

4038
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:22,060
Even if you're better against Wolverine.

4039
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:23,440
What was our second battle?

4040
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:23,880
I forgot.

4041
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:26,360
Bucky.

4042
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:27,540
Bucky.

4043
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:29,720
It's Bucky here, so we leave VP open, right?

4044
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:30,160
That's fine.

4045
02:15:30,780 --> 02:15:31,040
Oh, wait.

4046
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:33,160
Actually...

4047
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:33,560
No, I know.

4048
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:34,320
They told me to counter.

4049
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:34,960
No, do Bucky.

4050
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,500
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

4051
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:37,520
Yeah, we're fine.

4052
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:38,140
We'll be okay.

4053
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:43,060
Should've just typed it again so we could get passive aggressive in chat.

4054
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:48,620
I still don't get that.

4055
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:49,360
It was so weird.

4056
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:51,380
I don't know what that was about.

4057
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:55,220
That's crazy that they like...

4058
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:56,260
That's so funny.

4059
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:59,600
They're like, we cannot let Gomez play Starlord again.

4060
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:03,340
They got the treatment once and then they said, nope.

4061
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:05,400
It's like that one time.

4062
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:10,020
Do you remember that scrim where they like, one time let Bettle play Mech and we full-held the team?

4063
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,640
And they said, no more for Bettle.

4064
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:13,300
No more Mech for Bettle.

4065
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,520
You know, it's great though.

4066
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,720
You know, Bettle's not a one-trick anymore.

4067
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,360
Yeah, it forced him to learn.

4068
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:28,280
I can't wait to see it, Bettle.

4069
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,840
Real talk though, I still see a Neymar here, right?

4070
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:32,820
For now, yeah.

4071
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:36,680
I should be on Hella right now, but I'm gonna do this for now.

4072
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:38,540
Yeah, and then if it doesn't work, you swap to Hella.

4073
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:42,980
Yeah, no being like, but I'm doing so...

4074
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:48,440
Look, he told me to swap when I had 30 kills and I was like, are you sure?

4075
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:51,760
Yeah, and then you swapped and we fucking demolished them.

4076
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:56,320
I'll never go against your word.

4077
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:58,680
I wonder, they don't see me on this balcony outright, right?

4078
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:00,260
Like, if I sit behind this sign.

4079
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:01,840
Where?

4080
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:03,780
Oh, there.

4081
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:04,580
Yeah, they can see you.

4082
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,240
You can do like a surprise attack.

4083
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:07,180
Hawkeye, Hawkeye.

4084
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:08,240
Hawkeye, always.

4085
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:10,700
I'll play a little casually here.

4086
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:12,760
I got their support!

4087
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,560
I got their Hawkeye!

4088
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:14,180
Oh shit!

4089
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:15,300
Oh my god!

4090
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:17,440
Fuck him up!

4091
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:18,080
Fuck him up!

4092
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:18,660
Get the Wolverine!

4093
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:19,820
Oh my god, I'm fucking them up!

4094
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:21,140
We can't dash, we can't dash!

4095
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:23,040
Strange low, strange low!

4096
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:23,640
Oh my god!

4097
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:25,160
Back up, back up, back up!

4098
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:26,160
Gordie, Gordie, Gordie, Gordie!

4099
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:26,960
Oh my god!

4100
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,820
You were just fisting the spine of Gord!

4101
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,780
I saw that!

4102
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:34,060
I was trying to get that Wolverine, bro!

4103
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:35,000
Get what he needs!

4104
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,580
Where's my D?

4105
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:39,260
There's no way, they don't expect it again?

4106
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,760
Wait, wait, they don't know!

4107
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:41,520
They don't know, behind you, look!

4108
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:42,480
Look up there, look up there!

4109
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:43,280
Do they know?

4110
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:44,200
They don't know!

4111
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:44,860
They don't know!

4112
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:46,160
Oh shit, shit, shit!

4113
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:52,020
I'm hiding, I'm hiding, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

4114
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:54,100
Careful, careful, careful, you guys have me.

4115
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,020
You'll need heal, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

4116
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:57,160
Linking.

4117
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:01,660
He can't dash out.

4118
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:07,440
No heals?

4119
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:11,180
I got the Hawkeye, I think.

4120
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:14,200
Nemo, Nemo, Nemo, Nemo, Nemo one, Nemo one, Nemo one.

4121
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:15,020
Oh, he's frozen, he's frozen.

4122
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:17,240
I have ult, I have ult.

4123
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,240
I have ult, popping it!

4124
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:20,400
They got it.

4125
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:23,160
I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

4126
02:18:25,460 --> 02:18:27,120
I'm coming back, you guys can stay alive.

4127
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:28,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.

4128
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:32,280
Coney, Coney, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

4129
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:34,100
I'm good, yeah, I'm going in, I'm going in.

4130
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:36,160
Sorry, I shouldn't have ulted, I shouldn't have ulted.

4131
02:18:36,380 --> 02:18:36,620
My bad.

4132
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:38,400
Yeah, communicate, say stuff.

4133
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,120
Yeah, yeah, if you're ulting, just tell us if you're ulting.

4134
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:41,940
I, I, I just picked Coney.

4135
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:44,200
I made Coney turn around.

4136
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:45,140
On me, on me.

4137
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:46,720
Someone just fucking beaten me.

4138
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:47,260
What the fuck?

4139
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,740
I don't know what that was.

4140
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:50,580
Okay, we're fine, we have no soulbind.

4141
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:51,900
We have four ult, we're good, we're good.

4142
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,280
Yeah, they have, they're gonna strange ult.

4143
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:54,920
I ult strange ult, I ult strange ult.

4144
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,060
Okay, okay.

4145
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:58,460
They have, they have all their ults, they use nothing.

4146
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:58,840
Just hold this corner, hold this corner.

4147
02:18:58,840 --> 02:18:59,960
They use nothing, just remember.

4148
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:01,660
They have everything too.

4149
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:02,540
I'm holding this corner.

4150
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:03,680
I broke up for you, I broke up for you.

4151
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:04,320
Okay.

4152
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:08,840
Oh my god, oh my god.

4153
02:19:09,060 --> 02:19:10,860
He can't dash out, he can't dash out.

4154
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,080
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4155
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:14,720
If I shift, you stop.

4156
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:16,440
They're getting fucked back here, they're getting fucked back here.

4157
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:17,580
Hawkeye on the left, Hawkeye on the left.

4158
02:19:17,660 --> 02:19:18,320
Hawkeye left, yeah.

4159
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:20,220
I'm backing up, backing up for a kill, backing up for a kill.

4160
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:20,740
I'm killing him.

4161
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,100
It's all ulted.

4162
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:25,540
Oh, I fucking, I can't move, I can't move.

4163
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:29,100
I killed a fucking, I don't even know how I killed that guy.

4164
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:32,760
I was just trying to kill Coney and I got a headshot.

4165
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,060
No trouble supports us.

4166
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:37,060
That's, I mean, that's not going to do anything.

4167
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:38,040
They don't know I'm here, don't worry.

4168
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:40,560
They don't know I'm here.

4169
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:46,140
If I say Feng can't move, just target him because he can't dash or shit.

4170
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,600
Feng's coming up, Feng's coming up to you.

4171
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:48,560
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to heal up here.

4172
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,800
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

4173
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:50,460
Thank you.

4174
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:53,060
I got him good.

4175
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:54,560
It's big, it's big, it's big.

4176
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,380
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4177
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:56,180
It's huge.

4178
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:57,800
Nice.

4179
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:58,420
Last fight.

4180
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:00,600
Oh my god.

4181
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:03,200
Oh my god, we have one fight left, one fight left, one fight left.

4182
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:04,960
Okay, okay, let's chill, let's chill.

4183
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,120
Yeah, let's chill, let's chill.

4184
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:07,180
They still have Shingo.

4185
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:08,080
You said last fight, I thought...

4186
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:10,420
No, no, I said the next fight is last fight.

4187
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:11,560
I'm dead.

4188
02:20:14,020 --> 02:20:14,560
It's fine.

4189
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:16,820
I get that shit fast.

4190
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:18,680
I'm going to stop Feng from moving.

4191
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:20,880
They forgot about it.

4192
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:21,880
They're BP, they're BP.

4193
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:22,460
Watch out.

4194
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:23,200
I'm back, I'm back.

4195
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,580
I have ult, I have ult.

4196
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:26,080
Oh, I need heal, I need heal, I need heal.

4197
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:27,480
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

4198
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:29,060
They got me.

4199
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:29,400
It's fine.

4200
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:30,840
It's fine.

4201
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:32,160
It's fine.

4202
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,540
They're BP now, yeah.

4203
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:34,300
I'm frozen.

4204
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:36,500
Lime, get ready for a rez, get ready for a rez.

4205
02:20:36,580 --> 02:20:37,700
Just don't play me, don't play me.

4206
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:39,880
I'm looking over here, right here.

4207
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,700
Thing dead, BP dead, BP dead.

4208
02:20:42,540 --> 02:20:44,260
Get ready for a rez, get ready for a rez here.

4209
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:46,920
They doubled, okay, nice.

4210
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:47,500
Yeah, yeah, here you go.

4211
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:48,040
Rez here.

4212
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:50,920
I'm up.

4213
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:51,480
Nice.

4214
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:56,920
I'm back up.

4215
02:20:57,220 --> 02:20:58,000
Okay, we'll go back.

4216
02:20:58,460 --> 02:20:59,620
Yeah, just back it up, back it up.

4217
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:03,000
I have ult up, I'm gonna hit backline.

4218
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:05,560
Getting body blocked.

4219
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:06,660
Oh, shit.

4220
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:08,360
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

4221
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:08,640
Alright.

4222
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:10,980
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

4223
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:11,460
Oh, big slam.

4224
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:12,960
Big slam, big slam.

4225
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,020
I'm alive.

4226
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:20,160
Adam in the back.

4227
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:23,080
I do see the Adam.

4228
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,580
Adam, Adam, Adam.

4229
02:21:24,580 --> 02:21:25,060
Dead.

4230
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:25,900
Got it.

4231
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:27,240
Rez, rez, rez, rez, rez.

4232
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:27,700
Again?

4233
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:28,660
Cloak, cloak, cloak.

4234
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:29,500
Again?

4235
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:29,900
Again.

4236
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:31,820
We need heals.

4237
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,120
We only have lime heals.

4238
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,380
I'm rezzing.

4239
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:35,720
Careful.

4240
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:36,700
Stay alive for a second.

4241
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:38,080
Yeah, she's rezzing, she's rezzing.

4242
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:38,700
Yeah, no heals yet.

4243
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:39,360
I can...

4244
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:39,920
Fuck me.

4245
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:40,800
I can't move.

4246
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:41,680
That's big, that's big.

4247
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,340
I can TP.

4248
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:45,840
TP, TP, TP, TP.

4249
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:46,740
TP, TP, TP, TP.

4250
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:47,880
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

4251
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:49,500
Jayce, that was bad.

4252
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:50,800
Save her!

4253
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:55,780
Whole team is here, whole team is here.

4254
02:21:55,860 --> 02:21:56,800
I'm waiting, I'll wait, I'll wait.

4255
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:58,560
If you can stay...

4256
02:21:58,560 --> 02:21:59,980
Okay, we're here, we're here now.

4257
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:05,260
Dude.

4258
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,460
Oh my god.

4259
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,660
Wait, I have no game sound.

4260
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:12,770
Where's my game sound?

4261
02:22:13,170 --> 02:22:13,290
I have ult right after this.

4262
02:22:13,310 --> 02:22:13,810
I have ult too.

4263
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:14,710
I have ult right after this.

4264
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:17,810
Okay, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4265
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:18,530
They all tp'd, they all tp'd.

4266
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:18,870
Back up.

4267
02:22:19,070 --> 02:22:19,810
Okay, I'm not doing it yet.

4268
02:22:24,770 --> 02:22:25,490
Oh, Christ.

4269
02:22:27,390 --> 02:22:28,230
I'm doing it.

4270
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,650
That's why I have two people on me.

4271
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:30,110
I have two.

4272
02:22:30,550 --> 02:22:32,070
I have two on me and two on you.

4273
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:35,270
Oh, I love that.

4274
02:22:35,570 --> 02:22:36,830
I love the eye of Morgan Moto.

4275
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:38,890
Get that.

4276
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:39,830
Oh, no, Panther.

4277
02:22:40,990 --> 02:22:41,570
Oh my god.

4278
02:22:42,470 --> 02:22:43,490
Do you want me on Su?

4279
02:22:44,890 --> 02:22:45,250
Yes.

4280
02:22:45,470 --> 02:22:46,170
Oh my god.

4281
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:46,650
Okay.

4282
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:46,710
Okay.

4283
02:22:49,050 --> 02:22:49,610
That's unlucky.

4284
02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:50,370
Holy shit.

4285
02:22:50,450 --> 02:22:53,750
My game sound, there's no game sound for me.

4286
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:56,070
Oh god, what is this audio shit right now?

4287
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:59,250
I can hear music, but the game sound bugged out.

4288
02:22:59,590 --> 02:23:00,810
It's okay, I can still play without it.

4289
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:02,990
Let me know if they all, I just can't play with sound cues.

4290
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:03,790
Okay.

4291
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:04,570
Okay.

4292
02:23:09,820 --> 02:23:10,960
I need heal, need heal, need heal, need heal.

4293
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:12,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4294
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:13,740
Where is this Adam?

4295
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:17,780
When my shield goes down, I won't have anything for you because the line of sight is really fucky up there.

4296
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:23,940
I hear like the sound of me fucking hitting people, but other than that, I have nothing.

4297
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:25,100
Strangest...

4298
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:25,540
I'm 1-HP.

4299
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:26,560
Yeah.

4300
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:28,160
Try, I got you, I got you.

4301
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:31,420
Oh, huge slam.

4302
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:33,380
Froze Venom, Froze Venom.

4303
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:35,460
Venom on me, Venom on me.

4304
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,400
Venom and Panther on me.

4305
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:41,380
I got him, I got him.

4306
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:42,800
Don't worry.

4307
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:45,060
Couldn't do it.

4308
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:45,720
Oh no.

4309
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:47,180
Oh fuck, I couldn't jump.

4310
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:47,860
It's fine, it's fine.

4311
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:48,520
It's fine, it's fine.

4312
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:49,520
Okay.

4313
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:51,740
Alright.

4314
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:55,580
I got like ulted somehow and then my game sound broke in that ult.

4315
02:23:57,260 --> 02:23:59,480
Like the strange ult broke my game sound.

4316
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:04,360
I wonder if that's what happens or like, you know, there's something weird going on with the game and it just breaks to varying degrees.

4317
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:05,120
Panther, Panther.

4318
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:05,740
I got you.

4319
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:06,660
Look at me, look at me.

4320
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:07,480
And Venom.

4321
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:08,900
I see my kill.

4322
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:11,480
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom.

4323
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:14,220
I'm just trying to kill these guys.

4324
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:14,600
Yeah.

4325
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:15,500
Nice, nice, nice.

4326
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:18,340
Venom has no Q, Venom has no Q.

4327
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:19,180
Okay.

4328
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,320
Panther on us.

4329
02:24:21,460 --> 02:24:22,580
Panther's still on the healers, yep.

4330
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:23,640
I'm ulting this.

4331
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:25,920
Sorry, I did it as you did it.

4332
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:27,380
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

4333
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,880
I'm damaging, I'm damaging, I'm damaging.

4334
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:29,840
Oh!

4335
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:31,260
He's got both of them up.

4336
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:34,620
I'm gonna look to ult after this.

4337
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,260
Got Adam.

4338
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:38,340
If I don't die here.

4339
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:39,320
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4340
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:40,120
Thank you.

4341
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:40,840
Stop Panther.

4342
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:42,000
I got you too.

4343
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:43,340
Thank you.

4344
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:45,680
I can play without sound.

4345
02:24:45,740 --> 02:24:46,100
Good shit.

4346
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:50,560
I have no sound Q for a strange ult.

4347
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:51,480
Yeah, sorry Doki.

4348
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:53,860
I was hitting Q as you said, I'm ulting this.

4349
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:54,380
Hey, okay.

4350
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:56,440
But they'll have...

4351
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,420
This is last fight, they have strange ult.

4352
02:24:58,460 --> 02:24:59,400
We have no support ults.

4353
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:00,200
Just remember that.

4354
02:25:00,380 --> 02:25:00,860
They don't support ults.

4355
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,140
Portal, portal, portal, portal.

4356
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:04,120
I don't know where the portal's gonna come, okay?

4357
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:05,180
I don't know where it's gonna come.

4358
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:06,520
I don't have audio.

4359
02:25:07,340 --> 02:25:08,020
Almost got him.

4360
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:09,040
I'm looking.

4361
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:10,600
Back here, back here.

4362
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:11,160
Okay.

4363
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:12,360
I see him, I see him right up there.

4364
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:16,300
It's so bad when I don't have audios for it.

4365
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:17,600
Thank you for the push.

4366
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:20,520
I'm ulting.

4367
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:23,460
Oh, I knew he was gonna do it.

4368
02:25:23,540 --> 02:25:24,420
That's fine, Q me up if you can.

4369
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:26,420
Nice, I got you.

4370
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:27,840
They just ignored the cart.

4371
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,780
Wait, I just sat on the fucking...

4372
02:25:29,780 --> 02:25:31,020
Good shit.

4373
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,860
So, I want you guys to hold top.

4374
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,480
I might be focusing their Adam a bit.

4375
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:34,880
Okay.

4376
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:38,200
Holy...

4377
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:39,660
Is that the one with the 15 deaths?

4378
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:40,720
Uh, yeah.

4379
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,600
Oh my god.

4380
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:43,720
Oh my god.

4381
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,280
15, good god.

4382
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:48,880
Oh my god.

4383
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:49,560
I literally...

4384
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:52,900
I'm playing with the fucking biggest handicap right now.

4385
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,080
It's so...

4386
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:55,780
I can hear my shots hitting.

4387
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:57,380
I can hear music.

4388
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:00,200
I hear no other audio other than that.

4389
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:01,460
Wait, genius idea.

4390
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:04,500
What if one of us screenshots and then you use that as the audio?

4391
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:06,300
That's so fucky.

4392
02:26:06,480 --> 02:26:07,940
That's so fucky because it's...

4393
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:09,660
Because then, like, I would think it's...

4394
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:10,280
Yeah, yeah.

4395
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:11,600
And all the...

4396
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,500
Wait, wait, can you guys, like, shoot your guns?

4397
02:26:13,580 --> 02:26:14,200
Can you guys shoot your guns?

4398
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:16,400
Okay, it's back.

4399
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:17,100
The audio is back.

4400
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:17,540
It's back?

4401
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:18,120
Okay, nice.

4402
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:18,460
Yeah, yeah.

4403
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:22,860
Do you still want me on Sue or should I go Adam for the push?

4404
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:25,840
I can switch if we need more heals, I guess.

4405
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:27,340
I think Sue was good when they...

4406
02:26:27,340 --> 02:26:28,720
Wait, did that Black Panther say Sue?

4407
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:30,480
Sue was really good against the Black Panther.

4408
02:26:31,500 --> 02:26:31,760
Yeah.

4409
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:33,420
I'll, um...

4410
02:26:33,420 --> 02:26:35,440
I'll try to run back for Panther a few times.

4411
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:36,920
Like, I didn't do it as much as I should have.

4412
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:40,600
I'm gonna be playing with a squid in the back too for you guys.

4413
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:42,640
We were doing a pretty good job at peeling for each other too.

4414
02:26:42,980 --> 02:26:43,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were.

4415
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:44,800
Yeah, we trusted each other.

4416
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:48,200
Are they on Penny?

4417
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:50,680
I thought I heard that too.

4418
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:51,360
Are they on Penny?

4419
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,240
Do you want me to swap up?

4420
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:53,180
Are you gonna say Psylocke?

4421
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:54,280
Watch Molly.

4422
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:54,540
Oh, yeah.

4423
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:57,160
Penny doesn't do anything with Psylocke.

4424
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:57,480
Oh, yeah.

4425
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:05,840
Did I just hear a sword?

4426
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:07,100
No, no, that's the spider.

4427
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:07,900
Penny.

4428
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:08,640
Oh, okay.

4429
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:09,580
I was so confused.

4430
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:11,400
Yeah, the spider sounds like sword footsteps.

4431
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,360
No one's taking damage, so I can't heal you.

4432
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:15,040
But Panther?

4433
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:17,120
Panther on me.

4434
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:17,720
Panther on me.

4435
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:18,440
Got him.

4436
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:19,480
Got it.

4437
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:20,360
Panther's done.

4438
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:22,060
We can push up a little bit.

4439
02:27:22,420 --> 02:27:23,140
Change is low.

4440
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:27,280
Change is still low.

4441
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:28,200
Change is still low.

4442
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:28,960
Change is one.

4443
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:29,680
Change is one.

4444
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:30,700
I got him.

4445
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:32,560
Oh, the mines.

4446
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:33,260
I'll trade out.

4447
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:33,580
It's fine.

4448
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:35,920
I have to eat the mines.

4449
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:37,920
Penny could die here.

4450
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:38,300
Nice.

4451
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:38,740
Good shit.

4452
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:40,700
I'm fine with eating the mines if it gets us through.

4453
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:41,200
It's fine.

4454
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:44,160
I got you an orb.

4455
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:46,200
But nobody is seeing that.

4456
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:47,020
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4457
02:27:51,860 --> 02:27:52,720
They portaled, bro.

4458
02:27:55,060 --> 02:27:56,240
That means they don't want to portal next fight.

4459
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:57,500
Just get it for us.

4460
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:58,260
Oh, I'm dead.

4461
02:27:58,740 --> 02:28:00,080
I couldn't get to you up there, sorry.

4462
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:01,300
I can break their mine.

4463
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:02,520
They can put their mine back here.

4464
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:03,120
Panther's stuck.

4465
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:03,620
He's behind.

4466
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:05,600
Can't kill Strange.

4467
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:06,760
No way.

4468
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:09,480
Oh, just play safe.

4469
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:10,260
Yeah.

4470
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,040
Penny, play safe if you can.

4471
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:13,620
Fuck, I tried to back up.

4472
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:17,380
I'm behind them right now.

4473
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:18,440
I think I got mixed.

4474
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:19,480
I thought that was our sual.

4475
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:20,060
That was stupid.

4476
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:20,480
Sorry.

4477
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:21,640
It's fine, I need to heal back here.

4478
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:22,880
It's fine.

4479
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:24,620
On the way.

4480
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:26,000
Push up for Gomez.

4481
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:26,700
Push up for Gomez.

4482
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:28,080
I got one.

4483
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:28,980
Hey, they ulted.

4484
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:29,400
Mirrored.

4485
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:30,100
Ult this.

4486
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:30,420
Ult this.

4487
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:30,740
Ult this.

4488
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:31,040
Ult this.

4489
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:34,920
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

4490
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:35,480
You know what?

4491
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:37,000
Oh no, I'm not going to swap now.

4492
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:38,080
I got ult right after this.

4493
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:39,920
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4494
02:28:40,020 --> 02:28:40,300
In the box.

4495
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:43,740
No, no.

4496
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:44,480
Okay, they got...

4497
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:47,200
I have, I have...

4498
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:47,820
Strange is half.

4499
02:28:47,900 --> 02:28:48,380
Strange is half.

4500
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,400
Give me up, give me up.

4501
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:50,960
I'm looking at Strange right now.

4502
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:51,880
Oh my god, my Q didn't go off.

4503
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:53,380
My Q didn't go off.

4504
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:55,960
I'm on Black Panther.

4505
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:57,420
He's dead, he's dead.

4506
02:28:57,500 --> 02:28:58,060
Black Panther's dead.

4507
02:28:58,500 --> 02:28:59,600
Just need more, just need more.

4508
02:28:59,640 --> 02:28:59,880
I'm good, I'm good.

4509
02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:01,040
Coming over.

4510
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,660
I kept my Q for their Strange then.

4511
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:04,620
I got ult ready for the next push.

4512
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:05,600
Good shit.

4513
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:05,920
Okay.

4514
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:06,820
Good job.

4515
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:09,520
He also got the ult.

4516
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:11,660
He's on Namor now.

4517
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:13,720
Yeah, he went Namor as well.

4518
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:18,860
You didn't know?

4519
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:20,100
Oh, they don't have Eos.

4520
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:21,420
Oh, this is great.

4521
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:23,380
Maybe they have my bug.

4522
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:24,260
Wouldn't that be great?

4523
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:25,740
They have no...

4524
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:27,040
Wait, behind you, behind you.

4525
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:27,820
There's a Panther up top.

4526
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:28,360
Panther up top.

4527
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:28,580
Okay.

4528
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:30,260
Just keep the push.

4529
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:31,300
Keep the push for the Panther.

4530
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:32,020
He's going behind right now.

4531
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:32,720
He's going behind right now.

4532
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:36,800
Oh, they're low.

4533
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:37,240
They're getting low.

4534
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:38,440
They're getting low, bro.

4535
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:40,680
Oh my.

4536
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:43,840
He's dead.

4537
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:45,140
Nice.

4538
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:45,540
Alright, my turn.

4539
02:29:45,620 --> 02:29:46,000
I'm doing it.

4540
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:46,660
Do it.

4541
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:47,600
Unleash the Ashe.

4542
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:50,660
Oh my god.

4543
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:53,080
Play of the game.

4544
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:55,580
He can't move.

4545
02:29:55,660 --> 02:29:56,120
He can't move.

4546
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:57,340
Ah, he got ult.

4547
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:57,580
Okay.

4548
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:58,480
Good shit.

4549
02:29:58,540 --> 02:29:58,840
Alright.

4550
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:00,020
Good job.

4551
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:01,980
Let me give you a snowflake.

4552
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:02,680
Let me give you a snowflake.

4553
02:30:02,680 --> 02:30:03,700
They wouldn't have a portal, right?

4554
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:05,060
No, they don't.

4555
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:05,980
Okay, he's ulting.

4556
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,400
Never mind.

4557
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:07,460
I might just be ganked.

4558
02:30:08,440 --> 02:30:08,620
Yeah.

4559
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:10,440
Good shit.

4560
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:11,240
Nice.

4561
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:11,580
Nice.

4562
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:12,820
Good job, guys.

4563
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:13,740
Well done, guys.

4564
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:14,240
Nice.

4565
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:14,780
Kilo.

4566
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:16,060
Shrug.

4567
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:18,440
With everything against us two.

4568
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:19,900
Wait.

4569
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:23,780
But who contributed the most, I wonder.

4570
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:27,380
The question everybody is asking.

4571
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:28,940
Wait.

4572
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,040
Cody, look at him.

4573
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:31,680
Look at that.

4574
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,080
Oh my god.

4575
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:34,960
They were right in it.

4576
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:35,940
51 kills.

4577
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,540
How does that happen?

4578
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:40,500
I swear that thing is like super weak.

4579
02:30:40,740 --> 02:30:42,340
I have no MVP or some shit.

4580
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:44,520
No MVP.

4581
02:30:44,980 --> 02:30:47,320
Nah, he farmed the 19 death guy.

4582
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:47,980
Oh, come on.

4583
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:49,100
Yeah, come on.

4584
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:50,380
He farmed him.

4585
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:51,180
Come on.

4586
02:30:51,900 --> 02:30:53,680
He has 19 deaths.

4587
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:54,280
Come on.

4588
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:00,080
Oh my god.

4589
02:31:00,140 --> 02:31:01,060
I can't believe.

4590
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:04,380
We were able to do so well despite getting like...

4591
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:05,980
Dude, there were so many weird issues.

4592
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:07,620
Everything was against us.

4593
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:10,800
The enemy team hated us for some reason.

4594
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:11,840
Audio hates us.

4595
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:12,980
The ping hates us.

4596
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:15,700
None of us wants us to win.

4597
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:19,680
Now it's the hard team that's coming in.

4598
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:20,800
I need to check Mace's stream.

4599
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:21,440
Oh, true.

4600
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:22,440
Yeah.

4601
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:23,640
We don't know.

4602
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:26,360
Is Mace winning or Rixie's team winning?

4603
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:28,380
It's got to be over by now, right?

4604
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:29,080
What is my...

4605
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:30,180
Can the chat help?

4606
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:31,640
They're watching our match.

4607
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:32,820
I'm not doing anything on my computer.

4608
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:34,300
I'm just gonna like...

4609
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:36,700
Wait, Rixie's team is demolishing them.

4610
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:37,720
Oh!

4611
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:42,120
Wait, if you look at statline.

4612
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:43,800
We know how to...

4613
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:44,960
But we scrimmed them.

4614
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:47,160
Unless they figure out how to counter it.

4615
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,740
But I don't know any team that's fucking running the shit we're running.

4616
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:54,120
I think we'll be fine.

4617
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:01,100
I can't believe how long it took for us and yet we're still...

4618
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:05,840
Because we had so many technical difficulties there.

4619
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,080
Mace ult!

4620
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:09,940
You have such a big ult angle.

4621
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:10,940
What is he doing?

4622
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:14,220
I'm like backseating Mace.

4623
02:32:14,320 --> 02:32:14,680
And he's dead.

4624
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:20,420
The thing is, they won the first round.

4625
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,420
But they're getting full...

4626
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:23,920
Wait, actually.

4627
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:24,500
No, no.

4628
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:25,160
Wait, no.

4629
02:32:25,220 --> 02:32:26,140
They lost the first round.

4630
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:26,940
They lost the first round.

4631
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:27,860
Around 99 to 99.

4632
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:30,660
So they lose this one.

4633
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:31,820
We're fighting Rixi's team.

4634
02:32:31,940 --> 02:32:33,740
And that's the team we scrimmed against the most.

4635
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:35,080
They scrimmed us too.

4636
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,760
So they know our chats as well.

4637
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:37,020
Right.

4638
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:40,000
They were the one we expected to fight.

4639
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:42,800
Is that the second to last team for us?

4640
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:44,800
No, that's the third to last team.

4641
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:46,400
Wait, no.

4642
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:46,580
Why?

4643
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:49,220
He got pushed away.

4644
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:52,300
That's too shit.

4645
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:55,260
What was our ban line for them again?

4646
02:32:57,200 --> 02:32:58,340
For Rixi's team.

4647
02:32:58,760 --> 02:32:59,400
Well, Bucky.

4648
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:01,220
We banned Bucky and something else.

4649
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:02,960
It was Bucky and something else, but I forgot.

4650
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:03,560
Was it Sue?

4651
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:04,880
Bucky Luna.

4652
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:05,560
Was it Luna?

4653
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:06,280
Oh, no.

4654
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:06,780
Bucky Sue.

4655
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:07,420
It was Bucky Sue.

4656
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:08,640
Okay, Bucky Sue.

4657
02:33:08,660 --> 02:33:09,180
Was it Sue?

4658
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:15,100
I can't look back to our history because we played so many custom games.

4659
02:33:16,060 --> 02:33:17,100
Mace off, Wolverine.

4660
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:18,140
I found it.

4661
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:19,380
You found it?

4662
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:21,520
Wait, I think I have it too.

4663
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:22,220
Wait, I have it.

4664
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:26,300
We did...

4665
02:33:26,300 --> 02:33:26,780
Okay, wait.

4666
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:28,080
Actually, is it this one?

4667
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:29,860
Aha!

4668
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:30,980
Wait, no, never mind.

4669
02:33:32,340 --> 02:33:34,740
Yeah, we played too many games.

4670
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:35,400
I can't go back.

4671
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,500
I found it.

4672
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:37,040
I found it.

4673
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:37,740
I found ours.

4674
02:33:38,380 --> 02:33:39,000
Oh, perfect.

4675
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:41,200
It was...

4676
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:42,620
Our ban line was...

4677
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:43,960
Oh, we forgot to ban the third.

4678
02:33:44,380 --> 02:33:45,700
I don't remember what we said.

4679
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:52,440
We did Bucky, Protect Luna, and then I forgot what our third ban was because we had to tell them what it was.

4680
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:55,880
And after that, it was Bucky, Mag, Hella.

4681
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:57,320
Yeah, because they're Hella.

4682
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:58,380
Their Hella was really good.

4683
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:01,540
Briggsie's Hella was good.

4684
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:03,420
And then our third ban line was...

4685
02:34:03,420 --> 02:34:04,380
Because they protected Hella.

4686
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,660
It was Bucky, Thing, Sue.

4687
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:09,700
So, we went...

4688
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:09,900
Yeah.

4689
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:14,420
Their Bucky was oppressive though, wasn't it?

4690
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:15,820
Yeah, their Bucky was very oppressive.

4691
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:16,740
Because they had two DPS.

4692
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:17,580
That's super oppressive.

4693
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:18,760
Their Bucky is a Bucky one trick.

4694
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:23,100
Yeah, I remember just feeling impossible until we got Bucky out.

4695
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:23,520
Yeah.

4696
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:31,520
So, we first banned Bucky, Protect the Thing, and then either banned Hella or Sue.

4697
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:34,080
Because their Hella was oppressive too.

4698
02:34:34,340 --> 02:34:35,780
Hella is MVP right now.

4699
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:37,880
Yeah, because Hella is Riggsie.

4700
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:39,460
And Riggsie is like...

4701
02:34:39,460 --> 02:34:40,760
Riggsie is really good.

4702
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:48,640
Like, the thing is, Riggsie is a Starlord one trick, but they have to give Gomez Starlord if like...

4703
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:53,200
If they want Riggsie to play his best character.

4704
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:54,780
Did they lose?

4705
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:55,780
Oh, did they lost?

4706
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:57,400
They lost.

4707
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,300
I can't tell.

4708
02:34:58,940 --> 02:34:59,560
No, they didn't.

4709
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,180
That was the last game.

4710
02:35:01,980 --> 02:35:02,100
Yeah.

4711
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:03,760
They just finished.

4712
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:04,340
Yeah.

4713
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:04,720
Okay.

4714
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:06,340
So, we're playing this team next.

4715
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:10,060
I'm ready.

4716
02:35:12,140 --> 02:35:13,740
Okay, so Bucky...

4717
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:16,380
Are we banning Hella or Sue for a second ban?

4718
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:19,880
Oh, I think they're regretting not banning Bucky or something.

4719
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:21,840
Yeah, they are.

4720
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:23,780
Mace is just talking about it.

4721
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:23,960
Yeah.

4722
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:26,120
Okay.

4723
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:28,920
Are we fighting the one we scrimmed against?

4724
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:30,160
Yeah, the one we scrimmed against the most.

4725
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:31,300
Mostly, yeah, I think so.

4726
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:31,640
Yeah.

4727
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:33,120
This is the game.

4728
02:35:37,020 --> 02:35:41,160
I'm kind of excited because that was like a lot of learning experience from them.

4729
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:42,900
Yeah.

4730
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:44,080
Those were good games, yeah.

4731
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:47,020
We ended up strong at the end, right?

4732
02:35:47,140 --> 02:35:47,680
Yeah, yeah.

4733
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:49,020
We're warmed up too.

4734
02:35:55,090 --> 02:35:55,570
Woah!

4735
02:35:57,250 --> 02:35:59,210
Alright, so they're banning Mag 100% then.

4736
02:36:01,210 --> 02:36:02,270
I'm not sure.

4737
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:02,530
We don't know.

4738
02:36:02,550 --> 02:36:04,250
I mean, they might try to ban him.

4739
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:06,130
If they haven't been keeping up.

4740
02:36:06,230 --> 02:36:07,750
If they haven't been keeping up, then they will.

4741
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:09,550
I think they've researched it.

4742
02:36:09,910 --> 02:36:11,690
The thing is...

4743
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:14,650
They might try and...

4744
02:36:14,650 --> 02:36:18,570
Because they know what comp we did that fucked them over the most.

4745
02:36:18,870 --> 02:36:19,550
Right, yeah.

4746
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:22,790
So, like...

4747
02:36:22,790 --> 02:36:23,390
They might...

4748
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:25,550
But the thing is, if they try to ban our tanks...

4749
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:27,870
Gomez gets...

4750
02:36:29,150 --> 02:36:29,890
Gets Starlord.

4751
02:36:29,910 --> 02:36:30,290
Yeah, he gets Starlord.

4752
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:35,130
Because they have to either ban Strange Mag or Thing.

4753
02:36:36,490 --> 02:36:37,510
They can't get all three.

4754
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:40,270
Oh, we have 40 minutes to an hour downtime?

4755
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:41,710
What?

4756
02:36:41,710 --> 02:36:41,950
What?

4757
02:36:41,950 --> 02:36:43,470
The fuck do I do?

4758
02:36:43,810 --> 02:36:44,430
What the fuck do we do?

4759
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:45,810
Guys, it's time to run a comp game.

4760
02:36:45,830 --> 02:36:46,650
Let's just zigzag.

4761
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:47,450
Let's just go.

4762
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:48,470
Let's just zigzag.

4763
02:36:48,470 --> 02:36:49,530
Should I get on my ult?

4764
02:36:49,850 --> 02:36:50,390
Should I get on my ult?

4765
02:36:50,670 --> 02:36:51,550
It's time, y'all.

4766
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:52,750
It's time to zigzag.

4767
02:36:54,050 --> 02:36:55,210
Alright, I'll get on the ult.

4768
02:36:55,470 --> 02:36:56,170
Okay, I'll get...

4769
02:36:56,170 --> 02:36:56,810
Wait, you guys are...

4770
02:36:56,810 --> 02:36:57,610
Oh, you guys are Celeste!

4771
02:36:57,730 --> 02:36:58,530
I can get on my other...

4772
02:36:58,530 --> 02:36:59,550
I can get on the Celeste account.

4773
02:36:59,970 --> 02:37:00,550
You can!

4774
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:01,330
Yeah, yeah, okay.

4775
02:37:01,770 --> 02:37:02,010
It's time.

4776
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:03,430
It's time, guys.

4777
02:37:03,630 --> 02:37:04,470
Let me put the...

4778
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:08,690
Let's see...

4779
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:12,180
Yeah, I gotta keep the muscle memory.

4780
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:15,260
Yeah, let's stay warm here.

4781
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:16,720
I'd like to stay warm, yeah.

4782
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:20,540
I'll be like, sorry, Jay.

4783
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:23,660
Oh, wait, are we in the...

4784
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,420
This is the finals?

4785
02:37:24,820 --> 02:37:27,440
I haven't even gone on my ult, and I'm already getting requests to play Iron Fist.

4786
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:27,780
Yeah.

4787
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:28,780
How are we gonna play Iron Fist?

4788
02:37:30,060 --> 02:37:33,460
So, we're in winner's finals, which means that we're guaranteed top three.

4789
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:33,940
Yeah.

4790
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:35,500
If we lose twice, we get third.

4791
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:37,060
If we win, we go on to Grands.

4792
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:37,760
Yeah.

4793
02:37:37,900 --> 02:37:38,160
Okay.

4794
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:39,240
Okay.

4795
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:43,140
But if we lose once, we get one more chance.

4796
02:37:43,980 --> 02:37:44,740
Because I sure...

4797
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:45,900
I have not been keeping track.

4798
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:57,590
Okay.

4799
02:37:57,590 --> 02:37:58,070
Let's see.

4800
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:03,850
I generally do not remember their other DPS.

4801
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:06,390
I'm just saying, sorry, Jay.

4802
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:11,410
Okay, waiting for grand finals.

4803
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:14,810
40 minutes.

4804
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:15,670
40 minutes.

4805
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:16,970
What is it, 40 minutes?

4806
02:38:18,610 --> 02:38:19,450
40 minute downtime.

4807
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:22,310
Bro.

4808
02:38:23,250 --> 02:38:24,530
I'll put this here.

4809
02:38:25,930 --> 02:38:26,990
Fucking, I don't know.

4810
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,870
Put it here.

4811
02:38:33,890 --> 02:38:35,790
You guys don't have to see the objective.

4812
02:38:36,210 --> 02:38:36,390
Fuck you.

4813
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:41,930
Alright, let me swap accounts.

4814
02:38:42,530 --> 02:38:45,490
We're playing with the guys.

4815
02:38:46,230 --> 02:38:46,950
I'm unmuted.

4816
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:47,950
I'm fucking stupid.

4817
02:38:48,370 --> 02:38:49,330
The guys.

4818
02:38:50,850 --> 02:38:51,910
Is he gonna ditch us?

4819
02:38:52,090 --> 02:38:53,290
Bro, what are you trying to say?

4820
02:38:53,490 --> 02:38:54,070
Yeah, he's trying to ditch us.

4821
02:38:54,070 --> 02:38:55,310
I'm playing with y'all.

4822
02:38:55,310 --> 02:38:56,090
I'm playing with you guys.

4823
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:56,750
I'm playing with you guys.

4824
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:02,050
Are you a content?

4825
02:39:02,170 --> 02:39:02,930
Are you a clip farmer?

4826
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:04,690
What am I hearing right now?

4827
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:05,310
No, no, no.

4828
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:11,010
Okay, sometimes when I press the mute button, sometimes it doesn't mute me.

4829
02:39:11,210 --> 02:39:12,330
And I get pissed at it.

4830
02:39:13,070 --> 02:39:14,570
I don't know why it doesn't mute me.

4831
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:17,650
Am I content farming for no reason?

4832
02:39:17,830 --> 02:39:18,610
Am I doing that right now?

4833
02:39:19,170 --> 02:39:20,170
Yeah, you're doing great.

4834
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:21,090
You're doing great though.

4835
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:23,390
Is this intentional?

4836
02:39:23,570 --> 02:39:24,190
It just feels like...

4837
02:39:24,190 --> 02:39:24,710
No, it's not.

4838
02:39:24,770 --> 02:39:26,630
No, I'm just wondering.

4839
02:39:29,010 --> 02:39:29,990
Ask my teammates.

4840
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:32,230
I always yap in their ears on accident.

4841
02:39:33,610 --> 02:39:36,590
Oh, did he just disappear?

4842
02:39:41,410 --> 02:39:42,650
My Discord just locked.

4843
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:43,670
Me too.

4844
02:39:46,730 --> 02:39:47,690
What happened?

4845
02:39:48,690 --> 02:39:51,530
I thought it was Jomez and I was losing my mind.

4846
02:39:51,630 --> 02:39:51,950
I was laughing.

4847
02:39:52,210 --> 02:39:53,070
Wait, what did I do?

4848
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:56,690
I just crashed in the middle of you saying colluge.

4849
02:39:57,310 --> 02:39:59,050
Yeah, you went colluge.

4850
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:09,910
Guys, I have to be a PNG for the rank because I have to swap Steam accounts.

4851
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:14,450
Alright guys, let me grab a PNG real quick.

4852
02:40:16,970 --> 02:40:17,810
I'm gonna make the room.

4853
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:18,730
I can start.

4854
02:40:18,890 --> 02:40:19,610
I've got most people on my list.

4855
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:19,910
Yeah, good.

4856
02:40:20,070 --> 02:40:20,910
Get rid of it.

4857
02:40:22,210 --> 02:40:23,130
Mute, swap.

4858
02:40:23,970 --> 02:40:31,590
I'm so used to... even though I've been streaming for a bit, I'm still not used to the streamer mode where I can't hear the...

4859
02:40:33,850 --> 02:40:34,850
I'm not used to it.

4860
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:36,110
That's weird.

4861
02:40:36,470 --> 02:40:37,070
Yeah, it's weird.

4862
02:40:37,230 --> 02:40:40,270
Yeah, you guys have been doing this for so long.

4863
02:40:40,330 --> 02:40:41,730
I know you guys are so used to it.

4864
02:40:41,750 --> 02:40:45,610
I can't tell if this is like you're just young or old.

4865
02:40:46,010 --> 02:40:46,990
No, he's young.

4866
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:48,250
I'm 21.

4867
02:40:49,170 --> 02:40:49,490
Okay.

4868
02:40:53,230 --> 02:40:54,770
Okay, I'll be respectful.

4869
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:56,390
I won't ask how old you guys are.

4870
02:40:57,230 --> 02:41:00,150
Yeah, the thing is his information is public.

4871
02:41:00,490 --> 02:41:02,130
Like you can literally look him up.

4872
02:41:03,170 --> 02:41:05,990
Oh, the opposite of VTubing.

4873
02:41:06,230 --> 02:41:07,070
Yeah, the opposite.

4874
02:41:07,870 --> 02:41:08,550
The gamer life.

4875
02:41:08,830 --> 02:41:09,870
I put out my whole name.

4876
02:41:10,030 --> 02:41:11,270
I put my birth date.

4877
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:13,290
He has a wicked Wikipedia.

4878
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:14,830
I do have a Wikipedia.

4879
02:41:15,550 --> 02:41:15,750
I do.

4880
02:41:16,310 --> 02:41:16,670
Nice.

4881
02:41:16,830 --> 02:41:19,050
And then, meanwhile, Connie has...

4882
02:41:19,050 --> 02:41:21,710
Oh my God, it even has your full... Oh my God, it's fully docked.

4883
02:41:21,770 --> 02:41:23,470
It has your first and last name.

4884
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:25,150
It doesn't have my middle name.

4885
02:41:25,770 --> 02:41:27,030
It doesn't have my middle name though.

4886
02:41:27,890 --> 02:41:30,870
Oh my God, guys, you can dox him right now if you want to.

4887
02:41:31,830 --> 02:41:32,210
Okay.

4888
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:34,730
Let's dox this dude.

4889
02:41:36,490 --> 02:41:37,830
He's gonna steal my identity.

4890
02:41:38,090 --> 02:41:38,990
Please help me.

4891
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:44,310
Guys, we have so many options.

4892
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:47,210
Okay, let me put myself up here.

4893
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:49,670
I'm just a face right now.

4894
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:52,630
Just a giant face.

4895
02:41:55,730 --> 02:41:57,450
The street you were born on.

4896
02:41:58,210 --> 02:41:59,290
Your mother's maiden name.

4897
02:42:01,630 --> 02:42:02,250
All that.

4898
02:42:02,690 --> 02:42:04,150
Using PNG.

4899
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:06,590
I'm okay talking about my family's names.

4900
02:42:06,990 --> 02:42:08,050
My dad's name is just like...

4901
02:42:08,050 --> 02:42:09,290
You're doxing your family?

4902
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:09,870
Okay.

4903
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:12,390
It's my family though.

4904
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:13,370
It's my family.

4905
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:14,990
Like, what are you gonna do?

4906
02:42:15,010 --> 02:42:15,410
Find them?

4907
02:42:15,610 --> 02:42:16,470
Is that what you're gonna do?

4908
02:42:17,810 --> 02:42:20,370
Dude, there's a rainbolt out there that can do it.

4909
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:23,770
Oh my God.

4910
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:25,370
That's crazy.

4911
02:42:26,930 --> 02:42:32,850
You're like, if my information is out in public, my entire family's gonna be out in public.

4912
02:42:35,670 --> 02:42:37,550
Are you sure you're not a clip farmer?

4913
02:42:37,950 --> 02:42:38,690
I'm not.

4914
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:39,490
No, I'm not.

4915
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:42,110
I'm just doing what I do.

4916
02:42:42,790 --> 02:42:46,050
It just seems like intentionally unintentional, you know?

4917
02:42:46,490 --> 02:42:47,510
I'm not trying to do anything.

4918
02:42:47,590 --> 02:42:48,210
I'm not trying to do anything.

4919
02:42:48,430 --> 02:42:48,970
I promise.

4920
02:42:49,250 --> 02:42:49,910
I'm sure you are.

4921
02:42:50,190 --> 02:42:50,630
I'm sure.

4922
02:42:53,650 --> 02:42:55,430
I've only been a streamer for like two months.

4923
02:42:55,950 --> 02:42:57,670
I don't know how to clip farm properly.

4924
02:42:57,950 --> 02:42:58,530
I don't know how to do that.

4925
02:42:58,710 --> 02:42:59,250
Wait, oh my God.

4926
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:04,610
I can use my new Chibi... I got like a Chibi model soon.

4927
02:43:04,990 --> 02:43:06,530
They sent me a PNG of it.

4928
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:07,530
I'm gonna use that.

4929
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:09,110
Bro, everyone be getting Chibi models.

4930
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:11,230
Wait, is it bad to be a clip farmer?

4931
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:11,750
Is that bad?

4932
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:13,550
Is it bad?

4933
02:43:16,610 --> 02:43:17,910
He's still doing it.

4934
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:22,550
He just doesn't stop, bro.

4935
02:43:22,670 --> 02:43:23,750
No, it's about me.

4936
02:43:24,330 --> 02:43:25,550
We're gonna teach him wrong.

4937
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:25,850
It's a joke.

4938
02:43:25,850 --> 02:43:26,810
I understand, man.

4939
02:43:26,930 --> 02:43:27,370
I get it.

4940
02:43:27,470 --> 02:43:28,390
You wanna play it out.

4941
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:30,710
Like, I'll play along with it too, dude.

4942
02:43:30,770 --> 02:43:31,270
It's all good.

4943
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:32,310
I got your back.

4944
02:43:33,570 --> 02:43:34,250
I got your back.

4945
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:36,010
Alright,

4946
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:40,960
I'm ready.

4947
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:44,720
Gomez, when do you think I started streaming?

4948
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:50,200
You're not allowed to do any googling.

4949
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:52,560
I was about to do that.

4950
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:56,720
Like, three years, I'd say.

4951
02:43:57,180 --> 02:44:00,400
I began streaming in 2011.

4952
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:02,020
What?

4953
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:06,340
I didn't even know that.

4954
02:44:06,760 --> 02:44:08,140
The internet was around then?

4955
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:09,460
I know, right?

4956
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:13,100
Yeah, we hopped on our dial-up when we got streaming.

4957
02:44:13,320 --> 02:44:14,160
It was.

4958
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:15,580
I assume that's you, Doki.

4959
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:17,800
Alright, that's me.

4960
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:18,160
That's me.

4961
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:18,860
That's me.

4962
02:44:21,280 --> 02:44:22,020
It's Mi-Dok.

4963
02:44:22,980 --> 02:44:23,940
Yeah, I'm Mi-Dok.

4964
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:26,720
Oh god, I just realized how old you were when I started streaming.

4965
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:30,520
Wait, how old was he?

4966
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:30,640
Wait,

4967
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:35,640
how old was he?

4968
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:36,580
Actual child.

4969
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:38,960
How old was he when you started streaming?

4970
02:44:39,220 --> 02:44:39,940
I can't math.

4971
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:41,140
Like, eight.

4972
02:44:41,440 --> 02:44:44,240
Oh my god, he was eight years old!

4973
02:44:46,340 --> 02:44:49,320
Dude was sipping juice boxes while you were streaming.

4974
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:51,380
What the hell am I doing right now?

4975
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:56,720
I do sound older than I sound.

4976
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,220
I mean, a lot younger than I sound.

4977
02:44:58,220 --> 02:44:59,840
I was gonna say, I didn't think you were 21.

4978
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:01,500
No, I'm older than 21.

4979
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:02,380
No, I didn't think so either.

4980
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:03,980
No, I thought he was like 30.

4981
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:06,080
Why does everyone think I'm old?

4982
02:45:06,260 --> 02:45:06,560
Why?

4983
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:08,720
You have that old energy on you.

4984
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:13,680
I just think like, I don't know, you said you played Overwatch Pro 2.

4985
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:17,200
And I was like, oh, wait, maybe he's been like a long time guy.

4986
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:18,280
He's been around for a while, yeah.

4987
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:19,600
No, I haven't.

4988
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:22,880
Like, Flats and Boger and all those dudes, right?

4989
02:45:23,020 --> 02:45:23,360
I don't know.

4990
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:26,780
He has an old spirit inside him.

4991
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:27,840
I do.

4992
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:30,340
Are you all ready to rank?

4993
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:31,400
Yeah, I'm ready.

4994
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:32,320
Alright.

4995
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:34,680
Let's go.

4996
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:35,240
We got this.

4997
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:39,660
Yeah, we're in some, ooh, we're in Celeste 2 lobbies now.

4998
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:42,800
This is where we lose in solo queue and get horribly demoralized.

4999
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:44,460
Oh, no!

5000
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:45,860
Don't say that.

5001
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,540
We have to practice our comps.

5002
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:49,140
We have to practice our comps.

5003
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:50,240
Cause like, we know what comps is good.

5004
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,760
I privated my profile so they don't check it.

5005
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:52,560
So they don't check it.

5006
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:53,680
Yeah, we know like...

5007
02:45:54,420 --> 02:45:55,860
What if they watch us?

5008
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:59,520
We all know like, what comps does best against them.

5009
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:01,280
So we all have to practice it.

5010
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:04,400
Bro, the estimated time is 5 minutes?

5011
02:46:05,720 --> 02:46:06,740
Oh, my God.

5012
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:07,820
Dead game.

5013
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:11,220
Dude, yesterday was like, instant.

5014
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:12,340
Yes, it was.

5015
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:14,680
Wait, but it's a Sunday.

5016
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:15,580
People should be playing.

5017
02:46:17,140 --> 02:46:18,500
People are at church, right?

5018
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:22,380
Oh, wait.

5019
02:46:22,500 --> 02:46:23,700
Discord crashed again.

5020
02:46:24,220 --> 02:46:24,960
I don't know.

5021
02:46:25,060 --> 02:46:25,880
Wait, did Discord crash?

5022
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:28,200
Nobody said anything there for a second.

5023
02:46:33,740 --> 02:46:34,080
Okay.

5024
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:36,060
I'm...

5025
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:36,560
Sorry.

5026
02:46:36,780 --> 02:46:37,080
So, yeah.

5027
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:41,840
If you guys didn't know, because I'm an alt account, I don't want to buy VTube Studio.

5028
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:43,420
Oh, wait.

5029
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:45,660
Oh, yeah, Discord is crashing.

5030
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,480
Come on, you guys.

5031
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:49,220
Hey, welcome back, everybody.

5032
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:50,060
Welcome back.

5033
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:50,760
I just got...

5034
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:53,900
I'm not gonna lie, I thought I got Donald for a solid 5 seconds.

5035
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,000
Me too, I thought so too.

5036
02:46:55,020 --> 02:46:55,380
But there it is.

5037
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:57,100
Fuck that Shoto guy, I don't care.

5038
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:58,300
My bad.

5039
02:47:00,360 --> 02:47:02,420
I looked over at my OBS, like panicking.

5040
02:47:03,140 --> 02:47:06,100
It's been less stable since we switched servers.

5041
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:07,280
Maybe we should switch back.

5042
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:09,100
Yeah, like, can we go back to EU?

5043
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:09,500
EU!

5044
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:13,720
Can we go back to EU?

5045
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:14,340
Should we?

5046
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:14,980
Do you want to?

5047
02:47:15,060 --> 02:47:16,100
I mean, we could test it out.

5048
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:17,720
To EU.

5049
02:47:17,820 --> 02:47:18,300
Yeah, we could us.

5050
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:21,100
Can we just keep it here for competitive or whatever?

5051
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:21,600
It's fine.

5052
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:23,320
Can we go back to EU?

5053
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:23,880
VC?

5054
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:26,940
The East Coast one keeps crashing.

5055
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,480
No, it's still gone.

5056
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:29,920
Yeah.

5057
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:30,640
Oh, what?

5058
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:33,000
Yeah.

5059
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:34,400
What the fuck is...

5060
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:34,680
Why?

5061
02:47:34,860 --> 02:47:35,520
Why us?

5062
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:36,700
What did we do to deserve?

5063
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:39,340
Like, why us?

5064
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:43,020
They're trying to contain our power.

5065
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:45,080
I have to play with no audio.

5066
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,820
That's actually fucking crazy.

5067
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:49,060
Trying to play with no audio.

5068
02:47:51,860 --> 02:47:52,760
I never expected...

5069
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:55,860
Lime was about to deal with that, which would have been insane.

5070
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:56,480
Yeah, no.

5071
02:47:56,900 --> 02:47:58,560
She was going to do something worse than that.

5072
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:00,600
She would have like zero audio overall.

5073
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:03,300
Yeah, that would have been very distracting.

5074
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:06,680
Yeah, at least I had the music to keep me company.

5075
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:09,220
Like, I had the game music to keep me company.

5076
02:48:10,740 --> 02:48:15,400
You're just like hyping out to the end of point music where you get your tense and everything and nothing else.

5077
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:17,360
Yeah, while everyone was dying around me.

5078
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:22,880
But that portal was so scary because it was like next to me and I had no audio cue for that.

5079
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:24,080
Yeah.

5080
02:48:24,220 --> 02:48:27,740
I like the idea of the screen share because all of the directional audio would have been wrong.

5081
02:48:28,060 --> 02:48:29,120
That would have been really funny.

5082
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:30,980
Oh, Betel.

5083
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:35,160
We were talking about the spawn portal, right?

5084
02:48:35,460 --> 02:48:39,420
So basically, I think what Gomez was trying to tell you to do was like...

5085
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:39,580
Oh.

5086
02:48:40,540 --> 02:48:41,480
Okay, that's great.

5087
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:42,200
That's awesome.

5088
02:48:43,580 --> 02:48:47,580
Dude, I'm about to crash out.

5089
02:48:47,700 --> 02:48:48,680
Yo, I'm not going to lie.

5090
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:54,280
Let me repeat myself.

5091
02:48:54,780 --> 02:48:55,640
Sorry, my bad.

5092
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:56,500
Yeah, hit me.

5093
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:08,080
So, about the portal thing, I think what Gomez was trying to explain was that we portal to where their...

5094
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:08,280
Oh, shit.

5095
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:08,640
My bad.

5096
02:49:09,180 --> 02:49:10,640
We portal...

5097
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:14,760
That was my chat.

5098
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:15,180
I'm sorry.

5099
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:22,100
Yeah, we portal to where their spawn room is.

5100
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:27,680
So, we just go to where they're about to enter their portal, you know what I mean?

5101
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:28,220
Yeah.

5102
02:49:28,220 --> 02:49:30,620
So, we could enter through their portal.

5103
02:49:31,340 --> 02:49:32,480
I'm going to get the map.

5104
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:33,160
What's the...

5105
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:33,960
Oh, wait.

5106
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:38,280
So, you were blocking their portal from where they're portaling from spawn?

5107
02:49:38,600 --> 02:49:39,980
No, we're not trying to block it.

5108
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:41,120
We're surprising them.

5109
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:45,060
Yeah, we're surprising them as they're trying to portal at their spawn area.

5110
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,300
Like, directly in where they leave spawn area.

5111
02:49:47,480 --> 02:49:47,700
You know?

5112
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:49,980
Their door, where they leave from spawn.

5113
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:50,680
That spot.

5114
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:55,600
So, do you not understand still?

5115
02:49:55,980 --> 02:49:56,680
I still don't get it.

5116
02:49:57,980 --> 02:49:59,260
Wait, there's no way.

5117
02:49:59,480 --> 02:49:59,700
It's in the map.

5118
02:49:59,900 --> 02:50:02,680
Okay, so you know how when we get out of our spawn...

5119
02:50:03,260 --> 02:50:07,860
Okay, Beto, do you know how when we get out of our spawn, we just walk out of our spawn and we make a portal?

5120
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:08,280
Yes.

5121
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:12,480
So, the enemy team also does that, right?

5122
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:13,340
Yes.

5123
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:20,360
So, the portal is supposed to be there, where they're at, at their spawn when they walk out the door.

5124
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:23,200
So...

5125
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:27,060
And then we go through our portal and then walk into their portal.

5126
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:28,420
Because it's like, what the fuck?

5127
02:50:28,700 --> 02:50:30,140
Because we show up in their portal.

5128
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:31,900
I'm literally going to pull out MS Paint right now.

5129
02:50:32,020 --> 02:50:32,980
That might actually help.

5130
02:50:37,420 --> 02:50:39,660
My auditory learning is really bad.

5131
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:43,780
Like, grab a PNG of a Marvel Rivals map right now.

5132
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:44,780
Like, puppet show that shit.

5133
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:46,100
Can we go into custom game?

5134
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:46,780
Can we just do that?

5135
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:48,280
Okay, look at this.

5136
02:50:48,400 --> 02:50:49,660
No, I'm going to draw it out for him.

5137
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:53,420
Why don't we just go to a custom lobby?

5138
02:50:54,560 --> 02:50:58,660
So, what does... I'm going to do the Bifrost Garden, yeah?

5139
02:50:58,780 --> 02:51:01,540
Okay, so this is where we enter, right?

5140
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:03,300
I don't see it, but yeah.

5141
02:51:03,300 --> 02:51:04,880
This is the enemy spawn room.

5142
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,440
This is their spawn area.

5143
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:07,980
That's where we start the game, right?

5144
02:51:08,260 --> 02:51:08,620
Okay.

5145
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:11,560
And then this is where we exit out of.

5146
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:13,360
There's all the trees and shit like that, right?

5147
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:13,880
It's all green and beautiful.

5148
02:51:13,880 --> 02:51:14,240
Did you draw those?

5149
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:15,260
Yeah, thank you.

5150
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:17,120
Yeah, I got you.

5151
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:17,520
I got you.

5152
02:51:18,180 --> 02:51:20,100
And then there's all those pillars around.

5153
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:22,140
Can we use the bathroom while you explain this?

5154
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:24,800
The main spawn area is this huge circle, remember?

5155
02:51:24,920 --> 02:51:28,480
If you put down the HP packs, I don't know where we are without the health packs.

5156
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,240
Okay, okay.

5157
02:51:29,280 --> 02:51:29,640
I don't remember.

5158
02:51:29,780 --> 02:51:30,480
Oh, there's a health pack.

5159
02:51:30,900 --> 02:51:32,100
There's one right here.

5160
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:32,900
Okay, yeah.

5161
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:34,540
There's probably one right here.

5162
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:36,100
Oh, now I remember.

5163
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:37,740
Right here, right here, right here.

5164
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:38,480
There's one right here.

5165
02:51:38,780 --> 02:51:39,780
Right, yeah.

5166
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:41,160
This is off the map.

5167
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:42,200
This is where you die, right?

5168
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:42,540
Yeah.

5169
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:43,820
Jeff loves this area, remember?

5170
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:44,160
Yep.

5171
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:46,720
Okay, this is where the statue is.

5172
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:47,600
Remember that big statue?

5173
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:51,260
And then this is like the wall that separates both sides.

5174
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:52,600
This is like a big tree.

5175
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:53,920
There's a big tree in the middle.

5176
02:51:54,440 --> 02:51:55,200
It kind of looks like a face.

5177
02:51:56,180 --> 02:51:57,260
Yeah, it does kind of look like a face.

5178
02:51:57,280 --> 02:51:57,860
No, don't say that.

5179
02:51:57,920 --> 02:51:59,020
All I see is a face now.

5180
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:00,080
No, it looks like you.

5181
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:01,580
It's an emoji.

5182
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:04,480
I think there's like another separator here.

5183
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:05,500
I don't remember exactly.

5184
02:52:05,900 --> 02:52:06,500
Those are stairs.

5185
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:07,800
Okay, those are stairs.

5186
02:52:07,860 --> 02:52:08,040
Whatever.

5187
02:52:08,220 --> 02:52:08,440
Fine.

5188
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:09,280
Okay, let me just...

5189
02:52:09,740 --> 02:52:10,340
There's stairs here.

5190
02:52:10,420 --> 02:52:10,560
Whatever.

5191
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,860
That's like...

5192
02:52:11,860 --> 02:52:12,460
Not the point.

5193
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:13,100
That's not the point.

5194
02:52:13,100 --> 02:52:15,880
Okay, there's like some stairs here.

5195
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:17,680
And then there's some stairs here.

5196
02:52:17,780 --> 02:52:18,680
He's drawing Heihachi!

5197
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:20,160
Oh, nevermind.

5198
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:23,900
And there's some stairs here too.

5199
02:52:24,080 --> 02:52:25,500
And then there's some stairs here too, right?

5200
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:27,360
So this is basically what I'm trying to say.

5201
02:52:27,560 --> 02:52:28,640
This is their enemy spawn.

5202
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:31,760
And pretend like this spot right over here, right?

5203
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:32,260
That's us?

5204
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:33,480
This is us.

5205
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:34,400
Yeah, this is our spawn.

5206
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:35,800
I'm going to make this blue, alright?

5207
02:52:35,980 --> 02:52:36,500
Just so you know.

5208
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:36,760
Oh, thank you.

5209
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:37,420
Color coordinated.

5210
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:40,000
Spawn.

5211
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:41,220
Good, good, good.

5212
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:42,080
What happens next?

5213
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:43,100
Okay, okay.

5214
02:52:43,300 --> 02:52:43,620
Us.

5215
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:45,300
US, whatever.

5216
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:46,040
It's us, okay?

5217
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:46,600
Okay.

5218
02:52:49,020 --> 02:52:49,660
Their strange...

5219
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:51,180
Let's say there's two strangers on the enemy team.

5220
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:52,540
He's over here.

5221
02:52:52,660 --> 02:52:53,940
This is Dr. Strange, right?

5222
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:54,400
That's him.

5223
02:52:54,900 --> 02:52:55,460
Yeah, that's him.

5224
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:55,840
That's him.

5225
02:52:55,940 --> 02:52:57,200
He's going to make a portal right here.

5226
02:52:57,260 --> 02:52:57,980
That's his portal, right?

5227
02:52:58,540 --> 02:52:58,840
Okay.

5228
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:01,160
I'll make it a little bit orange so you know...

5229
02:53:02,320 --> 02:53:03,340
I think we're just going through again.

5230
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:03,800
No, it's okay.

5231
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:04,940
I'm going to keep going.

5232
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:06,180
Strangers make you a portal.

5233
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:09,500
This is Enemy Strange Portal, right?

5234
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:09,720
Yep.

5235
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:10,940
Yes, for short.

5236
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:11,620
That's an acronym.

5237
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:12,900
Enemy Strange Portal.

5238
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:14,140
The Spanish portal.

5239
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:16,380
This is us.

5240
02:53:16,580 --> 02:53:17,300
This is you, Betel.

5241
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:17,900
That's you, Betel.

5242
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:18,800
I'll make you purple.

5243
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:19,820
That's me?

5244
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:21,080
Yeah, that's you.

5245
02:53:21,620 --> 02:53:23,460
And you're making a strange portal over here.

5246
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:23,880
Okay?

5247
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,120
This is your strange portal.

5248
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:25,840
Okay?

5249
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:31,560
You're going to make your strange portal go over to theirs right over here.

5250
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:33,020
Oh, to the side of it.

5251
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:34,560
To their spawn.

5252
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:35,340
So we surprise them.

5253
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:36,060
We jump out.

5254
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:38,500
So we're going to attack them while they're going in their portal.

5255
02:53:38,920 --> 02:53:39,340
Yes.

5256
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:39,440
Yes.

5257
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:41,760
No, no, no, no.

5258
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:42,000
Hold on.

5259
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:42,940
Wait, no, no, hold on.

5260
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:44,560
Betel needs to be explained properly.

5261
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:48,020
So they're going to put a portal down while we go over, right?

5262
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:50,780
And you put our portal onto their portal and their spawn.

5263
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:54,680
And then we take their portal to surprise them when they jump onto their portal.

5264
02:53:54,680 --> 02:53:55,220
Okay, I'll rewind.

5265
02:53:55,540 --> 02:53:56,020
It's changing.

5266
02:53:56,340 --> 02:53:57,640
That's not what the diagram shows.

5267
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:02,060
Okay, draw a portal on the middle point.

5268
02:54:02,480 --> 02:54:02,940
On the middle point.

5269
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:06,580
Oh, so we go out of our portal into their portal.

5270
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:10,140
Yes, fucking trolling my ass.

5271
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:10,740
I know it.

5272
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:12,020
Wait, did you send a visual?

5273
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:14,220
Look at the drawing.

5274
02:54:14,540 --> 02:54:15,580
Wait, where is the drawing?

5275
02:54:15,880 --> 02:54:16,440
Look in Discord.

5276
02:54:17,240 --> 02:54:18,560
I'm looking at the drawing, dude.

5277
02:54:18,680 --> 02:54:19,820
I still don't get it.

5278
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:20,580
Where's the drawing?

5279
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:21,380
I don't see it.

5280
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:27,780
Shadow hasn't put a portal on the point yet.

5281
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:30,120
Oh, we don't go in the portal.

5282
02:54:30,480 --> 02:54:30,740
Yes.

5283
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:34,300
This is the enemy portal right here.

5284
02:54:34,300 --> 02:54:35,580
This is their portal, right?

5285
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:36,480
Because they want a portal there.

5286
02:54:36,780 --> 02:54:40,020
We, from our spawn, we make the portal from our side.

5287
02:54:40,340 --> 02:54:42,160
What the fuck am I looking at?

5288
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:45,540
This is the most complicated shit you've ever drawn.

5289
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:47,700
How is this even possible?

5290
02:54:48,900 --> 02:54:51,540
How could anyone figure this out?

5291
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:54,840
Well, I see the map.

5292
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:56,500
I just don't understand what...

5293
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:58,460
Okay, we go into a custom lobby.

5294
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,740
Okay, we're going into a custom lobby.

5295
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:01,600
Oh my god, bro.

5296
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:04,260
There's just no way.

5297
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:08,720
I was on board, and then Gomez said no, and then it changed.

5298
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:12,680
Gomez said no, and then you were not on board anymore.

5299
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:15,420
Like, what am I looking at?

5300
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:23,000
Can someone take a screenshot of the drawing?

5301
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:25,360
Yeah, I took a screenshot of it.

5302
02:55:25,380 --> 02:55:27,300
I'm like, what am I looking at?

5303
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:29,900
Bro, why are you roasting the drawings?

5304
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:31,240
I'm trying to help.

5305
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:33,100
Wait, wait, wait.

5306
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:34,700
We might just start.

5307
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:35,600
I'm still in the spawn.

5308
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:40,180
They're not even gonna portal.

5309
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:41,880
Like, they're not gonna portal at the start.

5310
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:46,500
Oh my god, he actually blocked it.

5311
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:47,260
I freeze.

5312
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:49,820
Goodbye, Spider-Man.

5313
02:55:53,320 --> 02:55:54,700
Oh my god, I can't kill this anymore.

5314
02:55:57,300 --> 02:55:58,460
We'll just do that.

5315
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:02,080
My chat's like, wait, I can sword and see it.

5316
02:56:07,140 --> 02:56:09,180
What the fuck do you mean, I'll be back?

5317
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:10,740
No, no, no, stay, stay.

5318
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:13,160
I got requested to play Iron Fist.

5319
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:14,840
What do you mean, requested?

5320
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:16,420
Just don't turn it when you die.

5321
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:17,680
I request you don't.

5322
02:56:20,360 --> 02:56:21,620
Oh my god.

5323
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:23,860
I got requested.

5324
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:26,680
I gotta listen to the sound.

5325
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:30,080
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

5326
02:56:30,860 --> 02:56:32,420
Iron Fist, save us!

5327
02:56:37,860 --> 02:56:39,080
Where's our Iron Fist?

5328
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:41,840
Oh, and then he went back to spawn and stayed on Starlord?

5329
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:44,240
Oh my god, he's still on Starlord.

5330
02:56:45,480 --> 02:56:48,600
He left us to stay on Starlord.

5331
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:50,540
I was so excited for an Iron Fist.

5332
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:56,000
Well...

5333
02:56:56,540 --> 02:56:57,800
I'm thinking about that portal.

5334
02:57:00,760 --> 02:57:02,040
No, he's gotta think about the portal.

5335
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:04,140
We might have locked him for the rest of the tournament.

5336
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:05,860
He's just not gonna be able to...

5337
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:07,600
Look what you did, you broke him.

5338
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:09,780
You may have brain broke me until I figured this out.

5339
02:57:11,440 --> 02:57:14,380
I'm not kidding, I still don't get...

5340
02:57:14,380 --> 02:57:16,000
Well, we're going to Custom Lobby after this.

5341
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:18,140
We're going to... we'll visually show you.

5342
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:18,900
I'm not a troll.

5343
02:57:19,580 --> 02:57:21,600
It's not like... a bit.

5344
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:24,160
He's just... we broke him.

5345
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:24,720
What do we do?

5346
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:26,060
We broke him before the files.

5347
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:26,880
There's a Namor on us.

5348
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:27,660
There's a Namor on us.

5349
02:57:28,020 --> 02:57:28,780
Behind us.

5350
02:57:28,980 --> 02:57:29,460
Thank you.

5351
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:33,020
There's a Spider-Man on me.

5352
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:35,940
Spider... oh, we...

5353
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:38,020
Okay, after... after you...

5354
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:38,160
Oh!

5355
02:57:38,580 --> 02:57:40,580
Go soon, so you push the Spider-Man away.

5356
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:41,560
Oh, that's you.

5357
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:42,220
Oh, ow.

5358
02:57:43,220 --> 02:57:45,580
I'm good now, it's a...

5359
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:51,320
Pro so much as like, pro does not have imagination.

5360
02:57:56,300 --> 02:57:58,040
Should I run back to spawn while we're...

5361
02:57:58,040 --> 02:57:58,820
No, no, no, no.

5362
02:57:58,820 --> 02:57:59,980
Don't do what Gomez did.

5363
02:58:01,940 --> 02:58:04,380
Should we run back to spawn?

5364
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,020
What is happening to me?

5365
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:08,980
I can't... I can't even think.

5366
02:58:08,980 --> 02:58:11,860
Oh, no, we fucking lost two players.

5367
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:14,100
The fucking riddle thing has just broken the team.

5368
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:18,640
That entire drawing has fucked us up.

5369
02:58:19,660 --> 02:58:20,520
I'm still thinking about it.

5370
02:58:20,520 --> 02:58:21,280
Oh, no.

5371
02:58:21,720 --> 02:58:23,240
No, they have Spider-Man all.

5372
02:58:23,360 --> 02:58:24,180
I'm scared.

5373
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:26,110
I don't have Soul Link.

5374
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:27,760
It's fine.

5375
02:58:29,380 --> 02:58:30,200
I can't believe this is...

5376
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:30,560
Dude, it was a good drawing.

5377
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:31,480
It's... it's on me.

5378
02:58:31,620 --> 02:58:32,420
Like, it literally...

5379
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:34,880
It's a good drawing, bro.

5380
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:36,100
It wasn't a good drawing.

5381
02:58:36,300 --> 02:58:36,800
It's not your fault.

5382
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:37,440
Like, I got it.

5383
02:58:37,440 --> 02:58:38,860
He said he was a bad auditory learner.

5384
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:40,000
Like, what do we need to do?

5385
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:41,140
What's the play?

5386
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:42,860
Well, I need to see the game now.

5387
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:43,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5388
02:58:43,540 --> 02:58:44,240
Now we gotta see that.

5389
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:47,380
Yeah, we're gonna go to a custom lobby just to...

5390
02:58:47,380 --> 02:58:49,980
You think doing it in slides is going to make it any easier for us?

5391
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:52,840
And then we give them, like, a fucking lecture?

5392
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:55,580
I'll make you a video essay.

5393
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:01,880
The power of the double portal.

5394
02:59:02,580 --> 02:59:03,840
The power of the...

5395
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:05,440
This portal changed everything.

5396
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:08,980
Oh my god, they have snitches.

5397
02:59:09,220 --> 02:59:11,420
Whoa, I made it just in time.

5398
02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:12,440
Oh, I never mind.

5399
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:13,040
Jesus Christ.

5400
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:14,280
I did not make it.

5401
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:18,700
Yeah, yeah, Kony, upload a video tutorial.

5402
02:59:19,820 --> 02:59:22,860
Every exchange player needs to know 101.

5403
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:24,820
Oh, okay.

5404
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:26,260
Do not do it to their spawn.

5405
02:59:26,620 --> 02:59:27,020
Just...

5406
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:29,420
Okay,

5407
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:35,380
we have to go.

5408
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:36,100
Go, go, Kony, go.

5409
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:38,620
I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.

5410
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:41,660
I'm on point, I'm on point, I'm on point.

5411
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:43,860
Now I'm on point.

5412
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:44,260
No!

5413
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:49,900
I got separated, I got separated.

5414
02:59:50,320 --> 02:59:51,460
Oh no, not the door.

5415
02:59:51,460 --> 02:59:52,200
Oh my god.

5416
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:53,260
Oh no.

5417
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:03,040
Oh no, this broke our entire team.

5418
03:00:03,260 --> 03:00:04,780
We're not ready for the finals.

5419
03:00:04,780 --> 03:00:07,100
The morale is in totters right now.

5420
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:10,540
Why did they give us a 40 minute downtime?

5421
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:14,600
That really is so long.

5422
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:15,400
Yeah.

5423
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:17,480
Alright bro, I'm gonna run behind and ult.

5424
03:00:17,900 --> 03:00:18,260
Okay.

5425
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:19,300
I'm watching.

5426
03:00:19,660 --> 03:00:21,240
I'm going back there, I'm going back there.

5427
03:00:21,580 --> 03:00:21,880
Oh.

5428
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:23,800
Thank you.

5429
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:24,880
I got you, I got you.

5430
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:25,720
Thank you.

5431
03:00:25,820 --> 03:00:26,020
I'm here.

5432
03:00:27,700 --> 03:00:29,600
It is clobbering time too.

5433
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:31,200
He's so right when he says that.

5434
03:00:31,940 --> 03:00:33,400
Oh, he's so dead.

5435
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:35,820
Sorry, we were dealing with fighter's mech.

5436
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:37,220
Nice.

5437
03:00:37,220 --> 03:00:37,740
Oh, you got one?

5438
03:00:38,060 --> 03:00:38,600
Nice mirror.

5439
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:40,200
That's fine, we got one.

5440
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:44,920
I have my ult for this angel.

5441
03:00:45,820 --> 03:00:47,900
Yeah, he just fucking ran at me.

5442
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:48,660
That was crazy.

5443
03:00:50,820 --> 03:00:54,260
I like how Gomez is so locked in, he's not even saying anything anymore.

5444
03:00:54,480 --> 03:00:54,820
Oh, oh god.

5445
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:57,440
I'm off.

5446
03:00:57,680 --> 03:00:58,480
I forgot.

5447
03:00:59,220 --> 03:01:00,600
You forgot we existed?

5448
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:01,580
That's cool.

5449
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:02,060
No.

5450
03:01:02,060 --> 03:01:04,020
No, no, I'm just like, I forgot to talk.

5451
03:01:06,760 --> 03:01:07,820
He's so disassociated.

5452
03:01:07,820 --> 03:01:08,900
My energy's got drained.

5453
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:11,080
My energy's got drained from now on.

5454
03:01:11,280 --> 03:01:11,960
Oh, that's fine.

5455
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:12,620
Oh my god!

5456
03:01:13,740 --> 03:01:14,640
I've frozen my frozen.

5457
03:01:14,780 --> 03:01:15,520
Beat him up, please.

5458
03:01:15,640 --> 03:01:16,140
Beat him up.

5459
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:17,260
Try.

5460
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:18,600
He ran away.

5461
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:19,620
I'm looking to ult.

5462
03:01:19,860 --> 03:01:20,380
I'm looking to ult.

5463
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:21,040
Okay, okay, okay.

5464
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:22,420
I'm going to heal, I'm going to heal.

5465
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:25,540
It's fine, it's fine.

5466
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:26,720
He thought he went for the thing.

5467
03:01:26,740 --> 03:01:28,040
Bro, bro, what the fuck?

5468
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:30,580
It's fine, you're all fine.

5469
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:32,900
We're doing so good right now.

5470
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,380
Yeah, we're so healthy right now.

5471
03:01:34,480 --> 03:01:36,920
Against this team of random people who probably aren't on this course.

5472
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:40,520
Just like three stack.

5473
03:01:42,040 --> 03:01:48,140
Yeah, we had like, we just played four games of the fucking most competitive shit ever.

5474
03:01:52,210 --> 03:01:54,190
It's okay, we're just getting the int on our system.

5475
03:01:54,470 --> 03:01:57,310
And we're here just sitting here trying to figure out how to get Betel to...

5476
03:01:57,310 --> 03:02:00,050
I don't think we're ever going to need to use that, like.

5477
03:02:00,050 --> 03:02:01,650
Because the drawing's good.

5478
03:02:01,730 --> 03:02:03,250
I'm telling you, it's good.

5479
03:02:04,030 --> 03:02:05,010
I'm going to do this.

5480
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:07,770
Spider-Man's awesome.

5481
03:02:08,590 --> 03:02:09,390
Okay, we made it work.

5482
03:02:10,010 --> 03:02:10,970
We made it work, we made it work.

5483
03:02:11,890 --> 03:02:14,670
Oh no, somebody messed with the amazing Spider-Man.

5484
03:02:15,090 --> 03:02:15,430
No!

5485
03:02:16,410 --> 03:02:18,130
He tells you not to do that.

5486
03:02:19,170 --> 03:02:21,450
I did and I walked away.

5487
03:02:25,210 --> 03:02:28,130
I thought Spider-Man doesn't kill.

5488
03:02:29,050 --> 03:02:30,690
You messed with him too much.

5489
03:02:32,870 --> 03:02:35,210
It only takes one bad day.

5490
03:02:39,430 --> 03:02:41,350
Takes one bad day.

5491
03:02:41,530 --> 03:02:42,990
What the fuck is...

5492
03:02:46,510 --> 03:02:47,530
Where are you?

5493
03:02:47,590 --> 03:02:48,070
I got you.

5494
03:02:51,210 --> 03:02:53,250
Oh my god, guys, we're doing it.

5495
03:02:53,290 --> 03:02:54,010
We're doing it.

5496
03:02:54,110 --> 03:02:55,270
Celestial lobbies.

5497
03:02:55,270 --> 03:02:58,410
Wouldn't it be fucking crazy if everybody just ranks up?

5498
03:02:59,110 --> 03:03:00,370
Spider-Man down here.

5499
03:03:00,470 --> 03:03:00,950
They're portaling.

5500
03:03:03,890 --> 03:03:06,010
Where are they portaling?

5501
03:03:07,530 --> 03:03:08,430
Where the hell is Spider-Man?

5502
03:03:08,690 --> 03:03:09,930
Spider-Man's, like, below us.

5503
03:03:10,010 --> 03:03:11,150
He's, like, in this cavern.

5504
03:03:12,630 --> 03:03:13,810
Oh, they're on us.

5505
03:03:14,130 --> 03:03:14,670
Oh, Spider-Man on me?

5506
03:03:14,950 --> 03:03:15,550
How the fuck?

5507
03:03:15,630 --> 03:03:17,030
I think he tried to hit you and got me.

5508
03:03:17,170 --> 03:03:19,770
Yeah, because I walked to the side there.

5509
03:03:19,830 --> 03:03:20,790
My last minute walked to the side.

5510
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,830
When they drop, I'm going to ult.

5511
03:03:22,490 --> 03:03:23,810
Hey, I just accidentally got me.

5512
03:03:23,890 --> 03:03:24,470
Do you want me to ult here?

5513
03:03:24,470 --> 03:03:26,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5514
03:03:26,550 --> 03:03:27,150
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

5515
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:28,910
Oh, oh, not there, though.

5516
03:03:29,090 --> 03:03:29,090
It's okay.

5517
03:03:29,230 --> 03:03:29,790
No, it's fine.

5518
03:03:29,890 --> 03:03:31,230
Just help save our tanks.

5519
03:03:31,330 --> 03:03:34,890
I'm waiting for... I'm waiting for Thanos.

5520
03:03:35,950 --> 03:03:37,930
Oh, that was a sick flip.

5521
03:03:38,090 --> 03:03:38,950
I saw that.

5522
03:03:39,090 --> 03:03:39,790
I saw the flip.

5523
03:03:39,810 --> 03:03:40,350
Yeah, I saw that.

5524
03:03:40,590 --> 03:03:41,310
I dodged it.

5525
03:03:41,910 --> 03:03:42,750
I saw the flip.

5526
03:03:43,010 --> 03:03:44,370
Oh, that hook was so low.

5527
03:03:44,590 --> 03:03:44,810
Fuck.

5528
03:03:45,070 --> 03:03:46,190
I died with ults up.

5529
03:03:46,290 --> 03:03:46,750
I'll be back.

5530
03:03:47,670 --> 03:03:48,490
Okay, I have ults, too.

5531
03:03:48,490 --> 03:03:48,970
I'm coming back.

5532
03:03:49,210 --> 03:03:50,390
Okay, we run in and ult.

5533
03:03:50,390 --> 03:03:53,130
I have to...

5534
03:03:53,130 --> 03:03:53,130
Whoa!

5535
03:03:53,510 --> 03:03:54,610
Oh, I don't like that noise.

5536
03:03:55,110 --> 03:03:55,130
Whoa!

5537
03:03:55,550 --> 03:03:57,130
I'm just contesting point.

5538
03:03:58,350 --> 03:03:58,890
I'm also.

5539
03:03:59,130 --> 03:04:00,910
I'm just kind of spinning.

5540
03:04:01,450 --> 03:04:03,670
All right, three, two, one.

5541
03:04:04,310 --> 03:04:05,010
Oh, big slam.

5542
03:04:06,530 --> 03:04:07,710
Fuck, he was Spider-Man.

5543
03:04:10,370 --> 03:04:11,110
That's right.

5544
03:04:11,650 --> 03:04:13,050
Oh, match with Luna Snow.

5545
03:04:13,090 --> 03:04:14,090
Spider -Man can't kill no more.

5546
03:04:15,030 --> 03:04:16,150
Okay, we got it.

5547
03:04:16,190 --> 03:04:16,830
Yeah, we got it.

5548
03:04:16,830 --> 03:04:17,130
We got it.

5549
03:04:19,510 --> 03:04:20,810
We did it.

5550
03:04:20,970 --> 03:04:22,990
I've always believed in us.

5551
03:04:24,010 --> 03:04:24,490
Yay.

5552
03:04:24,830 --> 03:04:25,390
We did it.

5553
03:04:31,590 --> 03:04:33,330
All right, I'm ready.

5554
03:04:33,610 --> 03:04:35,530
I'm so fucking ready for finals.

5555
03:04:35,850 --> 03:04:36,990
I hate this map, dude.

5556
03:04:38,430 --> 03:04:40,130
Yeah, this map fucking sucks.

5557
03:04:40,470 --> 03:04:40,470
Yeah.

5558
03:04:40,950 --> 03:04:41,210
Yeah.

5559
03:04:43,290 --> 03:04:44,390
I'll just keep it there.

5560
03:04:44,390 --> 03:04:45,690
Without context, that looks like a submarine.

5561
03:04:47,270 --> 03:04:47,990
That's true.

5562
03:04:48,490 --> 03:04:50,430
I thought the trees were supposed to be beautiful.

5563
03:04:53,350 --> 03:04:54,390
Okay, okay, listen.

5564
03:04:54,510 --> 03:04:55,730
You're asking too much out of me.

5565
03:04:55,930 --> 03:04:58,810
When we were like 30 seconds into that ban phase.

5566
03:04:59,830 --> 03:05:00,830
That whole like...

5567
03:05:02,010 --> 03:05:02,390
What's that?

5568
03:05:03,390 --> 03:05:05,610
I just don't understand how you don't get that part.

5569
03:05:05,950 --> 03:05:06,750
Like, I'm...

5570
03:05:09,750 --> 03:05:10,650
That's fine, that's fine.

5571
03:05:10,930 --> 03:05:11,710
My bad, my bad.

5572
03:05:12,350 --> 03:05:14,310
Okay, with custom games, we gotta do a custom game afterward.

5573
03:05:15,690 --> 03:05:19,750
The custom game just to...

5574
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:22,550
I'm literally gonna pull up your stream and tell you where to go to.

5575
03:05:22,690 --> 03:05:23,590
Oh, no.

5576
03:05:23,730 --> 03:05:25,590
The wires have not connected, bro.

5577
03:05:25,750 --> 03:05:27,090
No, we have the enemy.

5578
03:05:27,650 --> 03:05:29,290
Okay, so this is how it...

5579
03:05:29,290 --> 03:05:33,810
Okay, we're gonna put Gomez on the enemy team and he'll play strange.

5580
03:05:34,110 --> 03:05:35,190
And he'll place a portal.

5581
03:05:35,570 --> 03:05:38,870
And then Beto, you place a portal in his spawn.

5582
03:05:39,810 --> 03:05:41,610
That's how we're gonna do it in the custom lobby.

5583
03:05:41,650 --> 03:05:42,570
And then he'll understand.

5584
03:05:42,990 --> 03:05:44,430
I have another idea too.

5585
03:05:44,490 --> 03:05:46,510
I have another idea after too.

5586
03:05:46,570 --> 03:05:51,310
Or Coney, Coney goes strange and then Beto watch our two strangers.

5587
03:05:51,970 --> 03:05:52,910
No, I have to do it.

5588
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:53,870
I have to do it.

5589
03:05:56,450 --> 03:05:59,530
I play this character!

5590
03:05:59,990 --> 03:06:01,990
Okay, show me, bro, show me.

5591
03:06:02,210 --> 03:06:04,570
You don't have to do it if you can't watch.

5592
03:06:05,150 --> 03:06:06,430
And we're too busy talking about a portal.

5593
03:06:06,550 --> 03:06:07,710
No more behind, no more behind.

5594
03:06:07,910 --> 03:06:08,470
Okay, I'm...

5595
03:06:08,470 --> 03:06:09,530
Oh, dead.

5596
03:06:09,710 --> 03:06:11,170
I couldn't look behind in time.

5597
03:06:12,870 --> 03:06:14,910
You see, we died because...

5598
03:06:16,450 --> 03:06:17,750
It's tearing us apart.

5599
03:06:18,390 --> 03:06:19,890
No, we're killing their backline.

5600
03:06:20,250 --> 03:06:22,010
Guys, guys, but who's gonna help me?

5601
03:06:22,010 --> 03:06:23,490
I am, I am killing their backline.

5602
03:06:23,510 --> 03:06:24,430
Who's gonna help me though?

5603
03:06:24,790 --> 03:06:26,590
Guys, why is this so...

5604
03:06:26,590 --> 03:06:27,250
There we go.

5605
03:06:27,470 --> 03:06:28,210
I still died.

5606
03:06:28,650 --> 03:06:29,130
There we go.

5607
03:06:30,410 --> 03:06:32,450
I wanted him to die in there.

5608
03:06:33,890 --> 03:06:35,030
Don't you pay for heals?

5609
03:06:36,370 --> 03:06:37,770
Oh yeah, heal, heal, heal.

5610
03:06:38,310 --> 03:06:38,870
Where's my team?

5611
03:06:39,270 --> 03:06:40,170
Where's the heals at?

5612
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:41,930
Where's my team?

5613
03:06:42,450 --> 03:06:43,810
MiDoc needs heals.

5614
03:06:48,670 --> 03:06:50,610
Where is MiDoc heals?

5615
03:06:51,950 --> 03:06:53,970
Sorry MiDoc, I got killed by a fish.

5616
03:06:54,710 --> 03:06:55,910
Damn, MiDoc's sad.

5617
03:06:56,490 --> 03:06:57,350
I will save you.

5618
03:06:57,490 --> 03:06:59,390
What the fuck is going on in here?

5619
03:06:59,710 --> 03:07:00,410
I'm good, I'm good.

5620
03:07:00,470 --> 03:07:01,310
What the fuck?

5621
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:04,650
I left you the moment you were like, I will save you.

5622
03:07:05,090 --> 03:07:05,890
Shift it out.

5623
03:07:07,130 --> 03:07:07,890
Alright, man.

5624
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:10,330
We'll do it again here, hold on.

5625
03:07:10,530 --> 03:07:11,510
Alright bro, I got E ready.

5626
03:07:12,390 --> 03:07:13,490
No more on the back side.

5627
03:07:13,690 --> 03:07:14,730
No more, no more, no more.

5628
03:07:15,130 --> 03:07:15,990
Let's keep going.

5629
03:07:16,370 --> 03:07:17,550
I don't care about no more.

5630
03:07:18,210 --> 03:07:18,750
We care!

5631
03:07:19,210 --> 03:07:19,630
You're a surprise kill!

5632
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:21,210
You're a surprise kill!

5633
03:07:22,250 --> 03:07:22,730
Okay.

5634
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:25,290
Yeah, yeah, see Coney left.

5635
03:07:25,490 --> 03:07:27,870
Guess who can't heal because you didn't care about him.

5636
03:07:28,250 --> 03:07:29,410
My team sucked.

5637
03:07:29,690 --> 03:07:30,130
Got it.

5638
03:07:30,270 --> 03:07:30,450
Alright.

5639
03:07:31,530 --> 03:07:32,710
Alright, I just changed out.

5640
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:33,450
I just changed out.

5641
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:34,470
You did everything else.

5642
03:07:35,750 --> 03:07:37,790
The true rank experience.

5643
03:07:38,490 --> 03:07:39,050
Eww.

5644
03:07:40,690 --> 03:07:42,530
Thing that charges into six people.

5645
03:07:44,830 --> 03:07:45,950
Big push.

5646
03:07:46,090 --> 03:07:46,630
Sorry!

5647
03:07:48,470 --> 03:07:50,250
I've had that happen before too.

5648
03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:53,030
Hilarious, he pushed it right in.

5649
03:07:53,130 --> 03:07:54,550
Oh wait, that wasn't your ult.

5650
03:07:54,910 --> 03:07:56,430
I thought that was Sona.

5651
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:57,910
I thought it was Sona.

5652
03:07:58,230 --> 03:07:59,430
I damage boosted the enemies.

5653
03:07:59,430 --> 03:08:01,350
No, no, definitely not.

5654
03:08:01,630 --> 03:08:02,790
I damage boosted the enemies.

5655
03:08:02,790 --> 03:08:05,870
I just go into spectate to see Bettle like running into a wall.

5656
03:08:06,730 --> 03:08:07,850
Where did he go?

5657
03:08:08,950 --> 03:08:10,390
No, Bettle, Gomez.

5658
03:08:10,650 --> 03:08:11,150
Oh, Gomez.

5659
03:08:11,450 --> 03:08:12,130
I was like, what?

5660
03:08:12,950 --> 03:08:14,810
Sorry, I didn't mean to call you out, Bettle.

5661
03:08:16,150 --> 03:08:17,530
He still haven't used portal.

5662
03:08:17,950 --> 03:08:18,610
I don't know.

5663
03:08:18,970 --> 03:08:21,850
After all those diagrams, no portal?

5664
03:08:22,010 --> 03:08:23,210
Yeah, after all those diagrams.

5665
03:08:23,570 --> 03:08:25,070
He's going to start portaling in front of the enemy team.

5666
03:08:25,070 --> 03:08:26,310
There's so much Loki up there.

5667
03:08:26,350 --> 03:08:26,910
I don't like that.

5668
03:08:28,510 --> 03:08:30,770
Oh, wait, I think you got the Loki clone.

5669
03:08:32,190 --> 03:08:32,810
Let's go!

5670
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:33,650
Good job, Loki clone.

5671
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:35,150
He's not going to TP.

5672
03:08:35,910 --> 03:08:36,710
That sucked.

5673
03:08:37,170 --> 03:08:38,270
I don't think so.

5674
03:08:39,270 --> 03:08:39,770
I'm walking.

5675
03:08:40,230 --> 03:08:42,450
See, this is why we're going to ban Suu.

5676
03:08:42,550 --> 03:08:44,230
So you'll have all those strange elves you want.

5677
03:08:45,430 --> 03:08:47,890
There's like a Namor above us, by the way.

5678
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:52,480
Alright.

5679
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:53,680
I'm causing so much pressure.

5680
03:08:54,580 --> 03:08:55,020
And?

5681
03:08:55,360 --> 03:08:56,660
Oh, I got one.

5682
03:08:57,160 --> 03:08:57,780
You stole it, though.

5683
03:08:57,780 --> 03:08:58,480
I got the kill.

5684
03:08:58,900 --> 03:09:00,140
Well, I did not steal it.

5685
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:01,320
I literally worked hard.

5686
03:09:01,580 --> 03:09:02,460
I stole it.

5687
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,220
I like how he's like, I got the kill.

5688
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:10,060
Armed and dead!

5689
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:11,360
Oh my god!

5690
03:09:12,940 --> 03:09:13,340
Again?

5691
03:09:14,180 --> 03:09:14,580
Again!

5692
03:09:16,060 --> 03:09:17,340
Do you guys want a portal?

5693
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:18,540
Yeah, portal us.

5694
03:09:18,740 --> 03:09:19,280
Yes, please.

5695
03:09:19,740 --> 03:09:20,680
Yes, we do.

5696
03:09:21,360 --> 03:09:21,860
I'm not doing that.

5697
03:09:22,680 --> 03:09:24,100
I'm not doing that shit anymore.

5698
03:09:25,900 --> 03:09:27,380
Where will this portal go?

5699
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:29,000
Where will this portal go, Bell?

5700
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:29,520
I don't know.

5701
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:32,260
Where is it going to go?

5702
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:33,580
Is it going to be a good portal?

5703
03:09:34,400 --> 03:09:35,660
Or is it going to kill us all?

5704
03:09:35,660 --> 03:09:36,180
I don't like this.

5705
03:09:36,260 --> 03:09:37,060
Into no more turrets.

5706
03:09:37,140 --> 03:09:37,860
I don't like that portal.

5707
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:39,840
There's a Loki on me!

5708
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:43,420
There's an Iron Fist on... oh, wait, no more on you.

5709
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:44,720
What the fuck?

5710
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:46,980
I'm already dead.

5711
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:47,540
I'm done.

5712
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:49,060
He threw a whale on a dead body.

5713
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:52,140
Wait, StrangerOne.

5714
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:53,140
StrangerOne, punch him.

5715
03:09:53,780 --> 03:09:54,180
Oh, nice.

5716
03:09:54,240 --> 03:09:54,960
He had no supports.

5717
03:09:55,160 --> 03:09:55,280
I will.

5718
03:09:58,400 --> 03:10:00,040
Alright, we're coming over.

5719
03:10:00,960 --> 03:10:03,020
He stranged all to me and then I died.

5720
03:10:03,380 --> 03:10:03,900
And stay out!

5721
03:10:04,220 --> 03:10:04,320
What?

5722
03:10:08,460 --> 03:10:10,140
Did you lock it?

5723
03:10:10,400 --> 03:10:12,700
Did you lock the game, Kevin?

5724
03:10:13,380 --> 03:10:14,880
Oh my god!

5725
03:10:15,020 --> 03:10:16,220
That's like crazy!

5726
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:17,680
And this shot got pulled in.

5727
03:10:17,840 --> 03:10:18,140
Alright, she's dead.

5728
03:10:18,920 --> 03:10:19,480
Kill her.

5729
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:20,120
Kill her.

5730
03:10:20,520 --> 03:10:21,200
I left her for you.

5731
03:10:21,440 --> 03:10:22,280
You guys aren't killing her!

5732
03:10:22,540 --> 03:10:22,700
Hello?

5733
03:10:23,180 --> 03:10:24,280
What do you mean?

5734
03:10:24,380 --> 03:10:25,480
All I can do is clap.

5735
03:10:27,580 --> 03:10:28,880
That's still killing her.

5736
03:10:29,100 --> 03:10:30,640
That's all I can do is clap.

5737
03:10:32,720 --> 03:10:34,300
Just a fucking K-pop song.

5738
03:10:34,940 --> 03:10:35,960
What do you want to do?

5739
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,220
Nobody's going that straight!

5740
03:10:40,660 --> 03:10:40,940
Again?

5741
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:42,660
What the fuck is this?

5742
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:43,240
What?

5743
03:10:43,540 --> 03:10:44,240
You guys see what I'm...

5744
03:10:44,240 --> 03:10:45,660
Oh, he's on the thing.

5745
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:49,960
There's a clone here!

5746
03:10:50,580 --> 03:10:51,060
There's a clone here!

5747
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:51,760
Do it again!

5748
03:10:52,020 --> 03:10:52,640
You missed a clone.

5749
03:10:53,320 --> 03:10:53,880
You missed a clone.

5750
03:10:57,980 --> 03:10:59,180
There's a Namor up here.

5751
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:00,400
There's a Namor up here.

5752
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:02,760
He might Agamotto up here.

5753
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:04,380
There's a Namor up here.

5754
03:11:04,480 --> 03:11:04,900
Behind us.

5755
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:05,720
Behind us.

5756
03:11:07,380 --> 03:11:07,780
Stop.

5757
03:11:08,600 --> 03:11:09,000
Bubble.

5758
03:11:10,720 --> 03:11:14,100
Guys, there's a turret just shooting you guys in the back.

5759
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:15,380
I'm going to ult right here.

5760
03:11:15,460 --> 03:11:15,940
I'm going to ult right here.

5761
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:16,500
Damage boost.

5762
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:17,980
I got you.

5763
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:19,360
No way I got you.

5764
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:21,280
I knew you were the right guy this time.

5765
03:11:24,500 --> 03:11:24,900
Nice.

5766
03:11:26,140 --> 03:11:26,960
Oh, we did it!

5767
03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:28,080
Nice.

5768
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:29,020
Good job.

5769
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:29,760
Good job.

5770
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:30,340
Nice.

5771
03:11:33,320 --> 03:11:35,060
This needs to be put to rest.

5772
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:36,740
I got more visuals for you, actually.

5773
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:37,460
No, I got...

5774
03:11:37,460 --> 03:11:39,360
No, just get us into custom lobby!

5775
03:11:39,800 --> 03:11:40,360
No, no, no, no.

5776
03:11:41,060 --> 03:11:41,780
It'll work.

5777
03:11:41,940 --> 03:11:42,380
It'll work.

5778
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:42,500
It'll work.

5779
03:11:42,540 --> 03:11:42,780
It'll work.

5780
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:47,500
So this time, I added something that will give you more...

5781
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:48,880
more of a visual, okay?

5782
03:11:48,880 --> 03:11:49,380
You see this?

5783
03:11:49,960 --> 03:11:50,560
Ah, shit.

5784
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:52,080
So you see this, right?

5785
03:11:52,320 --> 03:11:53,660
So I got an icon for you.

5786
03:11:57,100 --> 03:11:57,940
So you see it, Bubble?

5787
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,100
So this is you, okay?

5788
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:02,340
So this is you, okay?

5789
03:12:02,340 --> 03:12:05,040
It's Gomez's screen sharing.

5790
03:12:05,320 --> 03:12:06,860
Yeah, my screen sharing, okay?

5791
03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:08,740
This is what Gomez added, chat.

5792
03:12:08,780 --> 03:12:09,760
So basically...

5793
03:12:13,840 --> 03:12:16,260
So this guy is going to portal over here, right?

5794
03:12:16,520 --> 03:12:18,940
And his team is going to be like, oh, wow, over here, right?

5795
03:12:19,160 --> 03:12:21,320
They're all going to be walking the point and going out, right?

5796
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:23,220
They're going to be holding our spawn, right?

5797
03:12:23,440 --> 03:12:25,100
But instead, this is you now, right?

5798
03:12:25,260 --> 03:12:25,820
This is you.

5799
03:12:26,220 --> 03:12:29,420
So then, we're going to TP over here, right?

5800
03:12:29,860 --> 03:12:31,700
And then we take their portal.

5801
03:12:31,700 --> 03:12:32,840
That's what I said!

5802
03:12:32,920 --> 03:12:33,880
You guys said no!

5803
03:12:34,600 --> 03:12:35,880
I literally said that!

5804
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:38,840
Wait, I thought the way you were explaining it...

5805
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:38,960
Oh, okay.

5806
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:40,500
I made it seem like...

5807
03:12:40,500 --> 03:12:41,020
Oh, did you?

5808
03:12:41,480 --> 03:12:44,540
Oh, I didn't know that either.

5809
03:12:44,800 --> 03:12:44,920
Wait.

5810
03:12:46,660 --> 03:12:48,840
So my drunk was good.

5811
03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:50,040
My drunk was good, right?

5812
03:12:50,300 --> 03:12:51,680
You made me feel like a big fucking idiot!

5813
03:12:52,880 --> 03:12:55,960
You made me feel inept at art, bro.

5814
03:12:56,700 --> 03:12:58,580
You didn't get it, you know?

5815
03:12:58,580 --> 03:12:59,360
I said your drug was good!

5816
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:01,360
No, you didn't get it.

5817
03:13:01,700 --> 03:13:02,920
He didn't get it.

5818
03:13:03,160 --> 03:13:04,280
He gets it now, though.

5819
03:13:04,980 --> 03:13:05,760
He gets it now.

5820
03:13:06,180 --> 03:13:08,980
You're the strange icon that actually helped a lot.

5821
03:13:12,780 --> 03:13:14,240
That added quite a bit.

5822
03:13:15,880 --> 03:13:17,920
Why didn't you do that in the beginning?

5823
03:13:18,680 --> 03:13:18,700
I'm resigning.

5824
03:13:18,700 --> 03:13:19,480
I didn't think of that.

5825
03:13:19,620 --> 03:13:20,980
Because we were about to get into a game.

5826
03:13:21,240 --> 03:13:22,160
We were literally about to get into a game.

5827
03:13:23,020 --> 03:13:27,960
When you were explaining it, and then Betel said, Oh, so we portal to their portal, then take their portal.

5828
03:13:28,540 --> 03:13:29,480
And you said no.

5829
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,300
I was like, oh my god, that's what I thought too.

5830
03:13:31,300 --> 03:13:32,800
Am I stupid as well?

5831
03:13:33,460 --> 03:13:39,080
No, I thought he was saying we portal to their portal that's already on the site, and we take their portal and go to their spawn or something.

5832
03:13:39,180 --> 03:13:40,880
No, that's not what he meant.

5833
03:13:41,220 --> 03:13:42,320
No, I did get it.

5834
03:13:42,400 --> 03:13:43,240
No, shut the fuck up.

5835
03:13:43,300 --> 03:13:44,400
I do understand it.

5836
03:13:44,880 --> 03:13:48,080
Dude, I'm trying to explain your explanation.

5837
03:13:48,340 --> 03:13:48,960
I just might...

5838
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:50,060
Oh my god, bro, shut up.

5839
03:13:50,120 --> 03:13:50,580
I'm tired.

5840
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:51,240
I'm so tired.

5841
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:55,600
Dude, I like your drawing.

5842
03:13:55,700 --> 03:13:57,680
It looks like the map.

5843
03:13:57,800 --> 03:13:58,160
I'm glad.

5844
03:13:58,240 --> 03:13:59,240
I'm glad I didn't add enough greenery.

5845
03:13:59,240 --> 03:14:01,660
I'm putting it on my stream for the first time, and I'm looking at it.

5846
03:14:01,660 --> 03:14:02,760
He said I didn't add enough trees.

5847
03:14:03,180 --> 03:14:04,880
No, you said the trees were beautiful.

5848
03:14:05,080 --> 03:14:06,040
I don't see it.

5849
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:09,100
It's the green, bro.

5850
03:14:09,840 --> 03:14:11,480
You know what would have sealed the deal?

5851
03:14:11,620 --> 03:14:18,260
If you drew an arrow from my portal going into their portal, that would have...

5852
03:14:18,260 --> 03:14:19,460
There is arrows.

5853
03:14:19,540 --> 03:14:20,160
What do you mean?

5854
03:14:20,560 --> 03:14:21,380
There are arrows.

5855
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:21,580
No, another arrow.

5856
03:14:21,820 --> 03:14:25,080
We come out of my portal going into their portal.

5857
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:25,760
You know what I mean?

5858
03:14:25,760 --> 03:14:28,160
No, you didn't draw the last arrow.

5859
03:14:28,300 --> 03:14:29,780
You know, the portal to their portal.

5860
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:31,600
You forgot to draw an arrow there.

5861
03:14:32,520 --> 03:14:36,140
So it's like, what do you do after we got out of his portal?

5862
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:38,720
There's a visual clarity issue on my part.

5863
03:14:39,160 --> 03:14:40,400
Yeah, yeah, it's alright.

5864
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:42,140
Everybody makes mistakes, you know.

5865
03:14:45,340 --> 03:14:47,160
I failed as a teacher, I guess.

5866
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:54,360
It's okay, it's okay.

5867
03:14:54,680 --> 03:14:57,840
I think the map was good and the understanding was good.

5868
03:14:57,840 --> 03:15:02,900
It was just the conveying the understanding was apparently not a successful maneuver, so...

5869
03:15:02,900 --> 03:15:04,100
It's okay, we fixed them.

5870
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:04,720
We fixed Beto.

5871
03:15:04,740 --> 03:15:06,540
I think that was good team building exercise.

5872
03:15:07,160 --> 03:15:07,560
Yeah.

5873
03:15:09,840 --> 03:15:13,080
How much more time until the next game?

5874
03:15:13,100 --> 03:15:14,040
I think we have enough for one game.

5875
03:15:14,460 --> 03:15:14,860
Do we?

5876
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:15,840
I think.

5877
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:16,020
Are you sure?

5878
03:15:16,620 --> 03:15:17,700
Yeah, we have 20 minutes.

5879
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:18,500
Let's check, let's check.

5880
03:15:19,240 --> 03:15:19,940
Do we have 20 minutes?

5881
03:15:20,220 --> 03:15:21,340
Yeah, we should have 20 minutes.

5882
03:15:21,420 --> 03:15:21,900
They have to...

5883
03:15:21,900 --> 03:15:23,380
They have to...

5884
03:15:25,720 --> 03:15:26,080
Play...

5885
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:28,540
I think they're streaming the other loser, right?

5886
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:30,060
The last loser match.

5887
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:32,400
That sounded really bad.

5888
03:15:32,460 --> 03:15:33,380
The last loser bracket.

5889
03:15:34,220 --> 03:15:35,420
Yeah, they have to play three.

5890
03:15:35,480 --> 03:15:36,220
They have to play three games.

5891
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:37,060
Okay, yeah, we can run one.

5892
03:15:37,540 --> 03:15:37,700
Okay.

5893
03:15:38,260 --> 03:15:39,020
Actually, wait, wait.

5894
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:40,320
I have to walk my dog.

5895
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:42,960
So...

5896
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:44,540
We got seven minutes in queue.

5897
03:15:44,640 --> 03:15:45,280
Let's get Jay in here.

5898
03:15:45,720 --> 03:15:47,360
Alright, yeah, get Jay in here.

5899
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:48,260
I'll be right back.

5900
03:15:50,860 --> 03:15:52,500
Hold on, let me get him in here.

5901
03:15:52,600 --> 03:15:53,120
I'll be right...

5902
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:54,080
Wait, should I leave...

5903
03:15:54,080 --> 03:15:55,720
Oh, wait, but I want them...

5904
03:15:55,720 --> 03:16:00,940
I don't want to leave my chat, like, without anybody talking.

5905
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:02,620
Like, let's just be like...

5906
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:03,160
How about...

5907
03:16:03,160 --> 03:16:04,820
Can they, like, drag...

5908
03:16:04,820 --> 03:16:06,300
Open it for now?

5909
03:16:06,860 --> 03:16:08,060
One more slot for now.

5910
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:13,680
Hang out before our tournament game.

5911
03:16:15,180 --> 03:16:17,560
I mean, I could also just dip if Jay's not here.

5912
03:16:18,380 --> 03:16:19,680
Some guy wants a VOD review.

5913
03:16:19,780 --> 03:16:20,200
Jay...

5914
03:16:20,960 --> 03:16:23,260
Some guy wants a VOD review.

5915
03:16:23,880 --> 03:16:25,120
Someone in my chat wants a VOD review.

5916
03:16:25,280 --> 03:16:25,760
One...

5917
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:27,400
We have one more slot for rank.

5918
03:16:29,060 --> 03:16:29,760
Get in here.

5919
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:34,640
Alright, let's see.

5920
03:16:36,380 --> 03:16:38,680
Let's see if Jay is alive.

5921
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:41,040
Oh, he's streaming.

5922
03:16:42,420 --> 03:16:43,260
Where's Jay?

5923
03:16:43,480 --> 03:16:43,880
Where is he?

5924
03:16:44,580 --> 03:16:45,620
Jay just got out of...

5925
03:16:45,620 --> 03:16:47,160
Jay just got out of a rank game.

5926
03:16:48,180 --> 03:16:50,420
Oh, he is playing rank, though.

5927
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:51,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5928
03:16:51,480 --> 03:16:53,560
Just invite Jay into the...

5929
03:16:54,360 --> 03:16:57,060
Okay, let me leave the thing.

5930
03:17:00,480 --> 03:17:01,100
MeeDoc leaves.

5931
03:17:03,160 --> 03:17:04,080
MeeDoc gone.

5932
03:17:04,980 --> 03:17:05,900
MeeDoc gone.

5933
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:07,580
Yeah, MeeDoc gone.

5934
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:08,740
Alright, I'm gonna go...

5935
03:17:08,740 --> 03:17:10,840
I'm gonna go walk my dog.

5936
03:17:10,940 --> 03:17:11,800
I'll be right back, guys.

5937
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:13,000
Okay.

5938
03:17:14,920 --> 03:17:16,320
Alright, let me...

5939
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:17,100
Who is the one that...

5940
03:17:17,100 --> 03:17:18,120
Yuva...

5941
03:17:18,120 --> 03:17:19,260
Yuva seemed...

5942
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:19,700
active.

5943
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:28,400
The...

5944
03:17:28,400 --> 03:17:29,560
admin above the...

5945
03:17:30,700 --> 03:17:32,440
picture post also says...

5946
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:33,560
if you have any issues, give them a ping.

5947
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:35,140
Which one?

5948
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:37,680
Oh, real...

5949
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:37,960
Kamana?

5950
03:17:38,680 --> 03:17:39,120
No.

5951
03:17:39,460 --> 03:17:39,680
No.

5952
03:17:40,820 --> 03:17:41,180
Whitey.

5953
03:17:42,400 --> 03:17:42,740
Oh.

5954
03:17:43,300 --> 03:17:43,680
Wait, what?

5955
03:17:44,840 --> 03:17:45,360
Whitey?

5956
03:17:45,480 --> 03:17:46,160
Wait, what?

5957
03:17:46,420 --> 03:17:46,840
Wait, what?

5958
03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:48,380
So we're 2 for 2!

5959
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:49,520
We're 2 for 2!

5960
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:50,920
It's their name!

5961
03:17:51,260 --> 03:17:51,840
It's their fucking name!

5962
03:17:51,840 --> 03:17:52,840
That's insane!

5963
03:17:55,120 --> 03:17:56,540
He does it again!

5964
03:17:57,140 --> 03:17:58,480
He does it again, guys.

5965
03:18:01,460 --> 03:18:02,260
No, it's alright.

5966
03:18:02,800 --> 03:18:03,740
Guys, look.

5967
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:04,880
It's their name in Discord.

5968
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:06,160
It's their name in Discord.

5969
03:18:08,600 --> 03:18:09,040
Oh.

5970
03:18:09,320 --> 03:18:10,140
Okay, I see.

5971
03:18:11,380 --> 03:18:12,160
Oh, there we go.

5972
03:18:13,980 --> 03:18:14,900
Oh my god.

5973
03:18:20,700 --> 03:18:21,560
Lime has changed.

5974
03:18:21,980 --> 03:18:22,260
This game.

5975
03:18:22,260 --> 03:18:23,520
This tournament has changed her.

5976
03:18:23,980 --> 03:18:24,660
This is, yeah.

5977
03:18:24,980 --> 03:18:26,960
Playing competitive games, it changes a person.

5978
03:18:32,350 --> 03:18:33,550
I was just trying to be helpful.

5979
03:18:33,690 --> 03:18:35,930
Next time, I'll let you struggle and ping admins that aren't replying.

5980
03:18:38,510 --> 03:18:39,830
Okay, they're adding another slot.

5981
03:18:40,610 --> 03:18:41,950
Okay, now you can get in here.

5982
03:18:43,290 --> 03:18:43,650
Alright.

5983
03:18:45,650 --> 03:18:46,350
Jay, get in here.

5984
03:18:47,910 --> 03:18:48,630
Start it up.

5985
03:18:49,010 --> 03:18:49,910
Yeah, NVC.

5986
03:18:50,950 --> 03:18:51,810
Oh, that was fast.

5987
03:18:51,810 --> 03:18:53,590
It said 7 minutes estimated...

5988
03:18:53,590 --> 03:18:54,490
and then just went instant.

5989
03:18:54,830 --> 03:18:54,910
What?

5990
03:18:55,310 --> 03:18:56,330
Oh my god.

5991
03:18:57,470 --> 03:18:57,870
Okay.

5992
03:19:00,710 --> 03:19:01,110
Hello.

5993
03:19:01,870 --> 03:19:02,870
I'm going to support.

5994
03:19:03,030 --> 03:19:03,910
I'm going to lowkey duty.

5995
03:19:04,730 --> 03:19:05,750
You are, apparently.

5996
03:19:07,290 --> 03:19:08,910
Which means I'll probably need to be on Zoom.

5997
03:19:10,910 --> 03:19:14,710
Yeah, Jay, you missed out on probably the most brain-rotted fest of all time.

5998
03:19:15,090 --> 03:19:15,490
You missed out.

5999
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:16,950
I saw the portal drawing.

6000
03:19:17,690 --> 03:19:18,890
Oh, you saw the portal drawing?

6001
03:19:19,030 --> 03:19:19,610
Okay, good.

6002
03:19:20,450 --> 03:19:22,370
Just don't question how we got to that point.

6003
03:19:23,590 --> 03:19:24,930
No, I was watching the whole game.

6004
03:19:25,730 --> 03:19:30,290
Battle got so stressed when you guys said portal to the enemy spawn.

6005
03:19:32,450 --> 03:19:33,970
It was so funny.

6006
03:19:35,550 --> 03:19:37,490
Do I portal in their portal?

6007
03:19:37,710 --> 03:19:38,170
Oh, she whoops.

6008
03:19:38,950 --> 03:19:39,550
Oh, no.

6009
03:19:40,230 --> 03:19:41,250
Oh, no.

6010
03:19:42,910 --> 03:19:44,630
Wait, what happened?

6011
03:19:45,070 --> 03:19:46,930
I want to get the rocket van out of here.

6012
03:19:47,630 --> 03:19:48,230
Oh, no.

6013
03:19:49,130 --> 03:19:50,190
I thought we're not betting anything.

6014
03:19:50,650 --> 03:19:52,990
Cody, am I allowed to iron fist now?

6015
03:19:53,790 --> 03:19:54,770
Am I allowed, Cody?

6016
03:19:56,290 --> 03:19:58,570
Because Cody doesn't want me on the fists.

6017
03:19:58,750 --> 03:19:59,730
Oh, sorry, I was muted.

6018
03:19:59,890 --> 03:20:00,430
I don't know, bro.

6019
03:20:00,490 --> 03:20:01,550
You got me killed a lot.

6020
03:20:03,590 --> 03:20:04,230
Very selfish.

6021
03:20:05,070 --> 03:20:06,170
No, what do you mean selfish?

6022
03:20:06,750 --> 03:20:10,130
Well, you would go in and I would E to you and then you would go out because you were scared.

6023
03:20:10,290 --> 03:20:11,470
You baited me quite a bit.

6024
03:20:11,570 --> 03:20:12,770
No, that's what you're supposed to do.

6025
03:20:13,270 --> 03:20:14,250
That's what you're supposed to do, though.

6026
03:20:14,490 --> 03:20:15,050
All right, man.

6027
03:20:15,130 --> 03:20:15,370
Sure.

6028
03:20:15,530 --> 03:20:16,290
Go for it, I guess.

6029
03:20:16,470 --> 03:20:16,590
Whatever.

6030
03:20:18,130 --> 03:20:18,910
Okay, all right.

6031
03:20:19,030 --> 03:20:21,130
Yeah, we could do a triple and then you do...

6032
03:20:21,130 --> 03:20:22,150
How about this?

6033
03:20:22,150 --> 03:20:24,450
You throw me in and we stick together the entire time.

6034
03:20:24,450 --> 03:20:24,850
Let's go!

6035
03:20:25,210 --> 03:20:26,030
Yeah, there we go.

6036
03:20:27,490 --> 03:20:28,690
We feed together.

6037
03:20:31,230 --> 03:20:32,030
You better not.

6038
03:20:32,050 --> 03:20:33,990
You better not throw me off the map or into the spawn.

6039
03:20:34,290 --> 03:20:37,950
I mean, it depends on how good you're doing.

6040
03:20:38,090 --> 03:20:38,590
You know what I'm saying?

6041
03:20:39,010 --> 03:20:39,670
Oh, yeah.

6042
03:20:40,090 --> 03:20:41,030
Trust me, trust me.

6043
03:20:41,230 --> 03:20:44,070
I would always throw you in somebody's face if I get the opportunity.

6044
03:20:44,230 --> 03:20:44,710
That's way...

6045
03:20:44,710 --> 03:20:47,310
Okay, the map just blew up my computer.

6046
03:20:47,590 --> 03:20:47,810
Hello?

6047
03:20:48,070 --> 03:20:48,510
Oh, wait.

6048
03:20:48,570 --> 03:20:49,090
Are you gone?

6049
03:20:49,710 --> 03:20:50,370
No, no.

6050
03:20:50,370 --> 03:20:54,470
I had the thing where it was loading up the map and it got all bright.

6051
03:20:54,930 --> 03:20:55,550
Now you're talking into a game.

6052
03:20:55,870 --> 03:20:57,510
Now you're talking into a game, bro.

6053
03:20:57,850 --> 03:21:02,370
That was crazy.

6054
03:21:03,630 --> 03:21:05,830
Bro, your game blew up and my ears blew up.

6055
03:21:06,190 --> 03:21:06,490
Thank you.

6056
03:21:06,610 --> 03:21:06,950
I'm sorry.

6057
03:21:07,590 --> 03:21:08,890
I'll show you the clip later.

6058
03:21:08,990 --> 03:21:09,770
It's like I went to heaven.

6059
03:21:10,330 --> 03:21:11,630
I would love to see that.

6060
03:21:11,830 --> 03:21:12,650
I've never seen that before.

6061
03:21:12,790 --> 03:21:13,630
I've heard stories, though.

6062
03:21:14,510 --> 03:21:15,310
I got raptured.

6063
03:21:16,550 --> 03:21:17,510
All right, bro, hop on.

6064
03:21:18,530 --> 03:21:19,090
All right, I'm locking in.

6065
03:21:20,730 --> 03:21:21,450
Lock in.

6066
03:21:21,650 --> 03:21:22,710
We're going deep here.

6067
03:21:23,430 --> 03:21:24,830
I think someone's at the top left.

6068
03:21:25,050 --> 03:21:25,210
Careful.

6069
03:21:26,470 --> 03:21:26,830
Fire!

6070
03:21:28,510 --> 03:21:30,130
Yeah, Spidey, Spidey, Spidey.

6071
03:21:30,170 --> 03:21:30,810
Spidey on the top left.

6072
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:31,990
Oh shit, nice.

6073
03:21:32,050 --> 03:21:33,070
Oh my god, I'm so low, though.

6074
03:21:33,650 --> 03:21:34,310
Oh no, I'm so healthy.

6075
03:21:35,390 --> 03:21:37,270
No, you're healthy, you're healthy, you're healthy.

6076
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:38,310
So healthy, bro.

6077
03:21:38,430 --> 03:21:38,870
I got the thing.

6078
03:21:40,090 --> 03:21:40,450
Isolated.

6079
03:21:41,650 --> 03:21:42,590
Yeah, Spidey better be careful.

6080
03:21:42,770 --> 03:21:43,690
Oh, I'm not healthy anymore.

6081
03:21:43,970 --> 03:21:45,050
You're healthy, bro.

6082
03:21:45,250 --> 03:21:46,510
I guess I should be playing Luna here.

6083
03:21:46,750 --> 03:21:46,890
Adapt him!

6084
03:21:47,110 --> 03:21:47,830
Take him away!

6085
03:21:49,410 --> 03:21:50,290
Wait, throw me in.

6086
03:21:50,530 --> 03:21:51,030
Never mind, wait.

6087
03:21:51,890 --> 03:21:52,510
Come here!

6088
03:21:53,170 --> 03:21:54,710
I was playing with him?

6089
03:21:54,830 --> 03:21:55,350
Oh shit.

6090
03:21:55,830 --> 03:21:55,870
Ow!

6091
03:21:58,090 --> 03:22:00,750
Why did we bubble the Wolverine, bro?

6092
03:22:00,830 --> 03:22:02,790
I need you with me at all times.

6093
03:22:02,910 --> 03:22:05,170
Otherwise, I'm going to die to Spider-Man 100% of the time.

6094
03:22:06,070 --> 03:22:07,270
Speaking of Spider-Man, here he is.

6095
03:22:07,290 --> 03:22:08,490
I didn't know they had a Spider-Man.

6096
03:22:08,610 --> 03:22:08,890
My bad.

6097
03:22:09,190 --> 03:22:10,350
Yeah, I did not know they had a Spider-Man.

6098
03:22:11,070 --> 03:22:13,470
Yeah, this guy's been looking for me the entire time.

6099
03:22:13,770 --> 03:22:14,570
Okay, okay, okay.

6100
03:22:14,890 --> 03:22:16,610
So I need you to stay with me.

6101
03:22:17,170 --> 03:22:17,690
I'm here.

6102
03:22:18,790 --> 03:22:20,030
What are we going to do?

6103
03:22:20,710 --> 03:22:21,310
I don't know.

6104
03:22:21,390 --> 03:22:22,350
Oh my god, wait, you're right.

6105
03:22:23,810 --> 03:22:24,650
I'm just dead.

6106
03:22:25,510 --> 03:22:26,830
I'm coming for you, shut up.

6107
03:22:26,830 --> 03:22:27,510
Wait, bro!

6108
03:22:28,230 --> 03:22:29,630
You threw me to my death!

6109
03:22:29,930 --> 03:22:30,970
He just killed you anyway.

6110
03:22:31,630 --> 03:22:33,330
You hit the Z button.

6111
03:22:34,470 --> 03:22:35,950
No, you can hold me on your shoulder.

6112
03:22:37,390 --> 03:22:39,050
We can just hang around.

6113
03:22:39,330 --> 03:22:41,210
Like a parrot?

6114
03:22:42,430 --> 03:22:44,990
Yeah, I can be your...

6115
03:22:44,990 --> 03:22:47,710
Okay, this Spider-Man is a fucking homing missile.

6116
03:22:53,810 --> 03:22:56,610
I'm trying to heal everybody, holy shit.

6117
03:22:59,690 --> 03:23:00,090
I'm okay.

6118
03:23:00,990 --> 03:23:02,630
They ultied, just let them ult, just let them ult.

6119
03:23:03,350 --> 03:23:03,830
Damn unfortunate.

6120
03:23:05,550 --> 03:23:05,990
Bruh.

6121
03:23:06,330 --> 03:23:07,270
I couldn't hear it.

6122
03:23:08,210 --> 03:23:09,290
Don't worry, I'm alive.

6123
03:23:09,530 --> 03:23:11,250
We got five ults coming up.

6124
03:23:11,470 --> 03:23:13,170
We might need some more help with the Piety Man.

6125
03:23:14,990 --> 03:23:16,490
Y'all chill back a little bit.

6126
03:23:16,670 --> 03:23:17,550
I didn't kill him.

6127
03:23:20,050 --> 03:23:21,370
Oh god, the moon!

6128
03:23:25,950 --> 03:23:27,010
Oh, big slam!

6129
03:23:27,650 --> 03:23:29,470
Oh, right here, right here, right here.

6130
03:23:30,390 --> 03:23:31,930
Yeah, Moon Knight's in the front lines.

6131
03:23:34,070 --> 03:23:34,690
Oh, they're gonna die.

6132
03:23:34,910 --> 03:23:35,290
Oh god.

6133
03:23:36,010 --> 03:23:36,450
Oh no.

6134
03:23:37,090 --> 03:23:37,710
I fucked it up.

6135
03:23:39,890 --> 03:23:42,610
Genuinely, Spider-Man is fucking executing me, I don't know what to do.

6136
03:23:43,130 --> 03:23:43,970
I'll do it.

6137
03:23:43,970 --> 03:23:46,850
Okay, we're getting faults right now.

6138
03:23:46,910 --> 03:23:47,990
I'll kill the Wolverine.

6139
03:23:50,010 --> 03:23:51,130
I got terrained.

6140
03:23:52,250 --> 03:23:53,150
I'll shoot him.

6141
03:23:54,530 --> 03:23:55,030
Blast him!

6142
03:23:55,690 --> 03:23:56,290
I'll blast him.

6143
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:00,480
We're on triple.

6144
03:24:02,260 --> 03:24:03,660
I can try to go on DPS.

6145
03:24:04,960 --> 03:24:06,220
No, no, no, no.

6146
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:09,820
I'll do it, I'll be our lord and savior.

6147
03:24:10,520 --> 03:24:13,820
I can DPS as well, but I need somebody...

6148
03:24:14,340 --> 03:24:15,820
Who here knows how to support solid?

6149
03:24:16,640 --> 03:24:17,100
Spider-Man here.

6150
03:24:19,400 --> 03:24:21,600
Doki doesn't like my healer.

6151
03:24:22,240 --> 03:24:23,320
But I can show my healer.

6152
03:24:24,160 --> 03:24:24,880
Also, I just got salted.

6153
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:29,280
I can show it.

6154
03:24:35,640 --> 03:24:37,740
Spider-Man's gonna come behind us right now, watch out.

6155
03:24:38,680 --> 03:24:39,220
He's dead.

6156
03:24:39,560 --> 03:24:39,880
Uh-oh.

6157
03:24:40,440 --> 03:24:41,040
Oh my god.

6158
03:24:42,460 --> 03:24:43,180
Am I dead?

6159
03:24:43,360 --> 03:24:44,700
I can block for you.

6160
03:24:46,260 --> 03:24:47,820
I have no shields anymore, no shields anymore.

6161
03:24:48,300 --> 03:24:49,360
Oh my god.

6162
03:24:50,740 --> 03:24:51,500
Moon spear!

6163
03:24:55,360 --> 03:24:58,820
We're getting absolutely...

6164
03:24:59,640 --> 03:25:00,640
I need to...

6165
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:02,260
I feel like we're not doing enough damage.

6166
03:25:02,600 --> 03:25:05,600
And I feel like I want to go onto a damage dealer right now.

6167
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:07,460
Yeah, go for it, go for it, go for it.

6168
03:25:07,720 --> 03:25:08,300
I have ult.

6169
03:25:09,060 --> 03:25:09,940
I'll do the support.

6170
03:25:10,560 --> 03:25:11,960
I'll do the support, I know how to play.

6171
03:25:15,240 --> 03:25:16,060
I'm going at him.

6172
03:25:18,040 --> 03:25:19,040
I have ult now.

6173
03:25:19,380 --> 03:25:21,120
We need a touch, we need a touch, we need a touch.

6174
03:25:21,280 --> 03:25:21,940
Yeah, we can touch.

6175
03:25:22,300 --> 03:25:23,400
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.

6176
03:25:23,400 --> 03:25:23,840
I'm on, I'm on, yeah.

6177
03:25:24,020 --> 03:25:25,060
Yeah, I'm going on as well.

6178
03:25:26,300 --> 03:25:27,220
Got the backline?

6179
03:25:27,980 --> 03:25:28,240
Oh!

6180
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:30,240
Okay.

6181
03:25:31,640 --> 03:25:32,580
Oh, we're all here.

6182
03:25:33,220 --> 03:25:34,000
That's massive, I think.

6183
03:25:34,100 --> 03:25:34,440
Oh, nevermind.

6184
03:25:35,320 --> 03:25:36,360
It looked like it.

6185
03:25:38,640 --> 03:25:39,940
They are all backing up.

6186
03:25:40,060 --> 03:25:41,200
Okay, well we got this corner.

6187
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:49,440
I have the link.

6188
03:25:49,960 --> 03:25:50,440
We're good.

6189
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:52,720
Oh no!

6190
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:53,520
Oh my goodness.

6191
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:55,760
Good God.

6192
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:56,540
I'm bugging, I'm bugging, I'm bugging.

6193
03:25:56,800 --> 03:25:57,360
Wait, that's good, that's good.

6194
03:25:58,080 --> 03:25:58,880
Yeah, we're still healthy.

6195
03:25:59,380 --> 03:26:00,400
Sorry, I only just got it.

6196
03:26:04,740 --> 03:26:05,600
Yeah, I don't pick to work.

6197
03:26:06,600 --> 03:26:06,880
Fuck.

6198
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:09,140
That's a decent pull.

6199
03:26:09,520 --> 03:26:10,440
Oh, Spider-Man!

6200
03:26:10,760 --> 03:26:11,720
I'm still touching, I'm still touching.

6201
03:26:13,740 --> 03:26:14,400
I'm rezzing.

6202
03:26:15,320 --> 03:26:15,580
Yep.

6203
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:16,340
And then I have an idea.

6204
03:26:17,280 --> 03:26:17,640
Yep.

6205
03:26:18,840 --> 03:26:19,540
Waiting for an idea.

6206
03:26:19,620 --> 03:26:19,940
I'm going to die here.

6207
03:26:20,760 --> 03:26:21,120
Nice.

6208
03:26:22,280 --> 03:26:22,800
Oh, I'm dead.

6209
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:23,680
Oh my God.

6210
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:24,840
Heal each other, heal each other, heal each other.

6211
03:26:25,100 --> 03:26:25,980
I'm trying, I'm trying.

6212
03:26:26,400 --> 03:26:26,460
Spider -Man down.

6213
03:26:29,720 --> 03:26:30,760
I'm just touching the button, okay?

6214
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:33,020
I'm not getting off.

6215
03:26:33,020 --> 03:26:34,000
Crystal One's up top.

6216
03:26:34,340 --> 03:26:35,120
She's pocketing this.

6217
03:26:35,280 --> 03:26:35,680
Oh, that's strange.

6218
03:26:35,680 --> 03:26:36,460
I'm one, I'm one.

6219
03:26:38,580 --> 03:26:39,520
Okay, Limu's alive.

6220
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:41,000
Oh my fucking God.

6221
03:26:41,600 --> 03:26:43,100
I'm getting out of the fucking...

6222
03:26:43,100 --> 03:26:43,240
Yeah.

6223
03:26:46,880 --> 03:26:47,180
Okay.

6224
03:26:47,180 --> 03:26:47,520
Oh, nice.

6225
03:26:47,900 --> 03:26:48,160
Star-Lord?

6226
03:26:48,680 --> 03:26:49,540
Okay, we got it, we got it.

6227
03:26:50,700 --> 03:26:52,340
Sit on it, sit on it, sit on it.

6228
03:26:52,820 --> 03:26:53,660
We're just practicing triple tank.

6229
03:26:53,660 --> 03:26:54,300
We're just practicing triple tank.

6230
03:26:54,400 --> 03:26:55,080
It's all right.

6231
03:26:55,800 --> 03:26:56,680
Got this, got this, got this.

6232
03:26:56,680 --> 03:26:57,000
Spider -Man on healers.

6233
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:58,620
Uh -oh.

6234
03:26:59,340 --> 03:27:00,100
I'm alive.

6235
03:27:05,100 --> 03:27:07,180
What is Mr. Spider-Man supposed to do against us?

6236
03:27:08,280 --> 03:27:08,700
Die.

6237
03:27:09,540 --> 03:27:09,920
Exactly.

6238
03:27:10,940 --> 03:27:11,640
Okay, all right.

6239
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:12,500
Well, we did that.

6240
03:27:12,600 --> 03:27:13,460
We're back, we're back.

6241
03:27:13,860 --> 03:27:14,380
We're on board.

6242
03:27:15,540 --> 03:27:16,220
We're on board.

6243
03:27:16,220 --> 03:27:16,820
We're just gaming today.

6244
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:17,520
Yes, sir.

6245
03:27:20,100 --> 03:27:21,340
Oh, I have ult?

6246
03:27:21,640 --> 03:27:22,200
Fuck, I'm...

6247
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:23,400
I see a bunch...

6248
03:27:23,400 --> 03:27:23,940
I'm back.

6249
03:27:23,940 --> 03:27:25,440
Are you guys winning?

6250
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:27,100
If we can't get strange, that's good, that's good, that's good.

6251
03:27:27,260 --> 03:27:27,980
I'm still on the point.

6252
03:27:28,380 --> 03:27:29,280
They all immediately...

6253
03:27:29,280 --> 03:27:30,080
I'm going for a big ult here.

6254
03:27:30,200 --> 03:27:30,980
I have ult in five, okay?

6255
03:27:31,220 --> 03:27:31,920
Are you guys winning?

6256
03:27:33,360 --> 03:27:34,120
No, no, no.

6257
03:27:34,460 --> 03:27:34,920
Kind of.

6258
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:35,380
I don't remember.

6259
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:36,620
Kind of, kind of.

6260
03:27:36,880 --> 03:27:38,000
Kind of, kind of, kind of.

6261
03:27:38,300 --> 03:27:38,360
Yeah.

6262
03:27:39,820 --> 03:27:44,380
So I might be doing some inspirational Adam gameplay at the moment.

6263
03:27:44,600 --> 03:27:46,940
You're letting him hold your SR hostage?

6264
03:27:48,840 --> 03:27:49,480
For content?

6265
03:27:49,640 --> 03:27:50,180
He is content.

6266
03:27:50,960 --> 03:27:52,280
I'm here, I'm here, I'm with you, I'm with you.

6267
03:27:52,540 --> 03:27:53,040
Oh, shit.

6268
03:27:54,380 --> 03:27:55,460
I'm one, I'm one, I'm one.

6269
03:27:55,560 --> 03:27:55,920
Okay, nevermind.

6270
03:27:56,040 --> 03:27:56,200
Gotcha, gotcha.

6271
03:27:56,760 --> 03:27:57,640
Yeah, that's...

6272
03:27:57,640 --> 03:27:58,340
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6273
03:27:59,160 --> 03:27:59,400
Nice.

6274
03:28:03,020 --> 03:28:03,700
Wait, what the hell?

6275
03:28:03,880 --> 03:28:04,140
We're fine.

6276
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:05,080
Careful, the moon.

6277
03:28:05,480 --> 03:28:05,920
Oh my god.

6278
03:28:06,780 --> 03:28:07,540
I'm so nervous, guys.

6279
03:28:07,960 --> 03:28:09,800
I can't believe we made it to the finals.

6280
03:28:09,800 --> 03:28:11,000
In America?

6281
03:28:11,460 --> 03:28:12,900
I got the whole front line, but...

6282
03:28:12,900 --> 03:28:13,320
Okay, thank you.

6283
03:28:13,860 --> 03:28:16,340
We'll get finals, like, grand...

6284
03:28:16,340 --> 03:28:20,520
It's not grand finals, but it's like finals, and then we get grand finals.

6285
03:28:21,980 --> 03:28:23,260
Oh, Sambo!

6286
03:28:23,720 --> 03:28:24,560
I'm so nervous.

6287
03:28:24,560 --> 03:28:26,200
Oh my god, bro, he's just...

6288
03:28:26,200 --> 03:28:29,580
I went deaf in real quick so I could talk to you guys.

6289
03:28:30,120 --> 03:28:31,880
Yeah, we got some...

6290
03:28:31,880 --> 03:28:32,980
The first game...

6291
03:28:32,980 --> 03:28:37,420
Those first games of the day was very, very scary.

6292
03:28:37,920 --> 03:28:41,060
It was definitely very, very, very scary.

6293
03:28:46,340 --> 03:28:49,820
So, I am glad that, you know...

6294
03:28:50,900 --> 03:28:52,960
We made it past that.

6295
03:28:55,200 --> 03:29:00,260
Yeah, I made mistakes, but I also did some cool plays, I think.

6296
03:29:03,940 --> 03:29:06,420
Yeah, the first game was really rough.

6297
03:29:06,480 --> 03:29:07,360
We were just...

6298
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:09,420
We had to figure out, like, what to play.

6299
03:29:09,520 --> 03:29:12,700
It's always, like, such a learning experience, like, when we can't play what we're used to.

6300
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:15,600
And we had to, like, figure out, like, what would be best.

6301
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:24,820
And then, I had to be more proactive in calling for swaps, you know.

6302
03:29:24,960 --> 03:29:26,580
Like, I'd be like, guys, we need to swap.

6303
03:29:26,680 --> 03:29:27,340
This isn't working.

6304
03:29:27,440 --> 03:29:28,160
We have to swap.

6305
03:29:28,240 --> 03:29:30,100
We have to swap this, etc., etc.

6306
03:29:30,560 --> 03:29:34,920
I'm glad that we did end up swapping the hell out.

6307
03:29:35,320 --> 03:29:39,760
And, like, I managed to, like, get past, you know, the pro player ego.

6308
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:46,160
You know, like, the DPS ego, where they're like, I'm not the issue.

6309
03:29:46,360 --> 03:29:47,420
I have more kills.

6310
03:29:47,960 --> 03:29:49,240
I have 30 kills.

6311
03:29:49,420 --> 03:29:51,460
And I was like, no, Gomis, we need you.

6312
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:54,260
You could have 50 kills right now.

6313
03:29:58,360 --> 03:30:00,560
I'm like, Gomis, you don't understand.

6314
03:30:01,100 --> 03:30:04,980
You might have 30 kills now, but you could have had 50 kills.

6315
03:30:07,960 --> 03:30:12,100
So that hell of a swap really, like, fucking clutched it for us.

6316
03:30:14,520 --> 03:30:19,900
Yeah, so I'm glad, like, people listened and we managed to get past that first.

6317
03:30:20,180 --> 03:30:23,120
And then I feel like because they saw, they're like, they can bleed.

6318
03:30:23,380 --> 03:30:26,260
They got them to, like, they got them to overtime.

6319
03:30:26,540 --> 03:30:28,440
Oh my God, Doki's team can bleed.

6320
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:36,280
You know, the other teams are, like, super confident and stuff.

6321
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:44,320
And it's just, oh my gosh, a lot of teams definitely did research on us, but we did research too.

6322
03:30:44,540 --> 03:30:47,820
Well, I did a lot of research last night because I went to bed.

6323
03:30:47,880 --> 03:30:48,660
I think I went to bed.

6324
03:30:48,780 --> 03:30:50,340
I couldn't sleep again.

6325
03:30:50,340 --> 03:30:54,460
You know how, like, I was, like, so, I don't know.

6326
03:30:54,540 --> 03:30:56,000
I think it's because it's the first real tournament.

6327
03:30:56,180 --> 03:30:58,800
So I always get super nervous when it's, like, the first real tournament.

6328
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:04,440
But I think, like, if I do another Marble Rivals tournament, I'll definitely be, like, a lot less nervous.

6329
03:31:05,380 --> 03:31:12,420
Because, like, this is my first real tournament where I can, like, actually, like, show my skill and my abilities and stuff like that.

6330
03:31:12,460 --> 03:31:18,820
So that's why I'm like, ah, you know, that's why I'm like, oh my God, what am I doing?

6331
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:27,300
Yeah, um, and I just hope, like, after this tournament, I definitely relax a lot more.

6332
03:31:27,660 --> 03:31:30,020
But yeah, I had trouble sleeping last night too.

6333
03:31:30,300 --> 03:31:32,320
I hit my third win last night.

6334
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:39,160
Like, I, somehow, I managed to hit my third win.

6335
03:31:40,840 --> 03:31:44,220
So I, like, was not tired at all.

6336
03:31:44,220 --> 03:31:46,380
And so I was like, oh no.

6337
03:31:46,460 --> 03:31:48,000
So I had to try to force myself.

6338
03:31:48,740 --> 03:31:53,540
I had to force myself to, like, sleep last night.

6339
03:31:53,960 --> 03:31:55,700
So I think I went to bed at 11.

6340
03:31:55,960 --> 03:31:58,040
I also coughed a lot too.

6341
03:32:00,840 --> 03:32:02,520
Oh, I'm back, by the way.

6342
03:32:02,540 --> 03:32:03,920
I'm not walking the dog.

6343
03:32:04,420 --> 03:32:12,180
I was, I, like, coughed myself awake, like, I think, like, two times last night.

6344
03:32:12,180 --> 03:32:16,180
So, like, I think it was, like, once at, like, midnight.

6345
03:32:16,720 --> 03:32:19,580
Again, at, like, two, like, three in the morning.

6346
03:32:20,020 --> 03:32:23,140
So I'm like, oh no, I'm, oh no.

6347
03:32:23,320 --> 03:32:31,420
I think, like, since, like, I'm taking two days off, I might actually go to the hospital to get something, get, like, antibiotics or something.

6348
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:35,320
Because, like, I don't care about the wait, four hours at the hospital.

6349
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:37,500
Like, I need this gone.

6350
03:32:37,500 --> 03:32:45,800
And I, just because I'm taking two days off, I'm taking two days off starting tomorrow.

6351
03:32:46,140 --> 03:32:47,680
So, like, I won't be streaming on Monday, Tuesday.

6352
03:32:47,900 --> 03:32:50,700
So I have the time to actually go to the hospital.

6353
03:32:51,580 --> 03:32:55,440
Because, like, if you guys didn't know, like, in Canada, it's really hard to see a family doctor.

6354
03:32:55,720 --> 03:32:58,300
Because, like, they don't, they're not taking new patients.

6355
03:32:58,380 --> 03:33:02,480
And that's why I haven't gone to a family, like, I haven't gone to the doctors in a long time.

6356
03:33:02,480 --> 03:33:20,360
So I might just go to the hospital and just wait and be like, uh, hello, can I please, you know, uh, can I please, you know, get a, get a, uh, antibiotics please and thank you.

6357
03:33:22,700 --> 03:33:24,580
Yeah, yeah, I haven't had antibiotics.

6358
03:33:24,800 --> 03:33:30,800
And I've been just taking over, like, over the counter, uh, over the counter, like, meds and stuff.

6359
03:33:33,920 --> 03:33:34,720
Um, yeah.

6360
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:37,380
So, like, for once, maybe I'll be able to.

6361
03:33:38,940 --> 03:33:40,180
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

6362
03:33:41,020 --> 03:33:42,080
Are they doing okay?

6363
03:33:42,860 --> 03:33:46,320
Uh, wait, uh, I'm wondering if I should, do I need to go on my main now?

6364
03:33:46,320 --> 03:33:50,940
I guess, like, I think after this, then it should be us, right?

6365
03:33:51,020 --> 03:33:52,300
I'm going to look at the challenge.

6366
03:33:53,140 --> 03:33:55,920
After they finish their ranked game, it should be us, right, guys?

6367
03:33:56,260 --> 03:33:57,040
I don't know.

6368
03:33:57,200 --> 03:33:59,180
I'm not paying that much attention, to be fair.

6369
03:34:01,940 --> 03:34:03,560
They're playing a game right now.

6370
03:34:03,720 --> 03:34:05,840
They're playing, oh, they're playing their one game at the moment.

6371
03:34:07,560 --> 03:34:08,620
Are they attacking?

6372
03:34:08,840 --> 03:34:09,340
They are.

6373
03:34:11,380 --> 03:34:18,540
Okay, I just wanted to know if we are, if we are, uh, who are they fighting?

6374
03:34:18,840 --> 03:34:21,820
Oh, they're fighting, oh, okay, I know who they're fighting.

6375
03:34:22,600 --> 03:34:24,440
They're fighting the team we knocked out.

6376
03:34:26,420 --> 03:34:31,140
Alright, uh, my screen is zoomed in, so we can't, oh.

6377
03:34:32,900 --> 03:34:34,580
We can't see the bars?

6378
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:35,920
Wait, what do you mean, bars?

6379
03:34:38,460 --> 03:34:39,760
What do you mean?

6380
03:34:41,840 --> 03:34:43,280
What do you mean by bars?

6381
03:34:49,990 --> 03:34:54,010
I can't wait to, like, sleep after this tournament.

6382
03:34:57,510 --> 03:35:00,370
I can't, I can't wait.

6383
03:35:01,270 --> 03:35:05,410
I can't, I can't wait to sleep after this tournament.

6384
03:35:05,730 --> 03:35:06,830
I'm so tired.

6385
03:35:10,410 --> 03:35:12,150
I'm so very tired.

6386
03:35:12,210 --> 03:35:13,930
I'm, like, so tired now.

6387
03:35:15,850 --> 03:35:18,050
I'm, like, looking forward to it.

6388
03:35:19,030 --> 03:35:22,510
Oh, I just, I'm just happy, you know, whatever.

6389
03:35:22,650 --> 03:35:25,410
I'm happy with our current placement, you know.

6390
03:35:25,670 --> 03:35:29,330
Whatever happens, like, we made it really far.

6391
03:35:29,510 --> 03:35:32,270
It was, like, a hundred and twenty teams.

6392
03:35:32,270 --> 03:35:40,970
And, like, and, like, Naimu had to learn, like, several supports right off the, like, you know.

6393
03:35:41,270 --> 03:35:43,690
She had to learn new supports going into this tournament.

6394
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:48,190
And then, uh, same with, like, Coney and Beto and everything.

6395
03:35:48,590 --> 03:35:52,570
So, like, I'm, I'm really proud of everybody for doing so well.

6396
03:35:52,690 --> 03:35:56,730
For making it, um, like, so far and everything.

6397
03:35:57,630 --> 03:36:04,910
Uh, yeah, um, no matter what happens from these games on, um, I'm happy with how far we went.

6398
03:36:05,630 --> 03:36:07,070
Yeah, we're all doing so well.

6399
03:36:11,400 --> 03:36:14,540
And, like, we don't, we're not, like, super passive aggressive.

6400
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:15,680
Well, I am a little, maybe.

6401
03:36:16,520 --> 03:36:18,900
But I, I, I, that's, like, my weakness.

6402
03:36:19,420 --> 03:36:21,480
I get, like, a little passive aggressive.

6403
03:36:22,160 --> 03:36:31,060
Um, because, like, the competitiveness, fucking, the competitiveness of me just fucking does that to me.

6404
03:36:31,560 --> 03:36:38,920
Um, but, like, uh, um, I'm trying not to be, I'm trying to be more, you know, less.

6405
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:45,660
I, I, I know I am really competitive and I get a little, a little passive aggressive sometimes.

6406
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:55,000
But I'm glad we have, like, people in our team that ups the morale for everybody, too.

6407
03:36:55,620 --> 03:37:03,400
Um, and, like, to make sure, like, we're all, like, you know, even if things are bad, we still, we're not, at least we're not yelling at each other.

6408
03:37:04,100 --> 03:37:07,200
Um, or, like, shouting at each other and stuff like that.

6409
03:37:07,260 --> 03:37:14,100
Because I was watching, I was watching VOD POVs of other, the other, the people we fought against.

6410
03:37:14,100 --> 03:37:22,340
And, like, some of them, like, were actually yelling at each other and was, like, so, like, mean to their own teammates.

6411
03:37:22,460 --> 03:37:25,100
And I'm like, oh, thank God we don't do that to ourselves.

6412
03:37:26,220 --> 03:37:30,900
I was just like, oh, thank God we are not like that.

6413
03:37:32,420 --> 03:37:35,620
Because that's a heavy mood killer right there.

6414
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:43,120
Yeah, yeah, that's definitely, um, I mean, yeah, one fucking team, like, self-reported their own teammate.

6415
03:37:43,120 --> 03:37:47,000
And got their team, like, kicked out, which was fucking great.

6416
03:37:47,080 --> 03:37:51,960
I was like, holy shit, what the f- they were in winner's bracket too.

6417
03:37:52,140 --> 03:37:56,320
I was so surprised, like, I was like, they're in winner's bracket.

6418
03:37:56,480 --> 03:37:58,380
It's not like they fucked up or anything.

6419
03:37:58,500 --> 03:38:01,920
They literally were, like, one of the better performing teams.

6420
03:38:04,300 --> 03:38:08,280
Because it's not like they, like, reportedly, like, reported somebody else.

6421
03:38:08,820 --> 03:38:13,900
I thought it was, like, another team reported them, but it was literally just a self-report.

6422
03:38:14,920 --> 03:38:18,960
And their team, the fact that their team name was terrible teammates was pretty funny.

6423
03:38:19,160 --> 03:38:24,760
Like, okay, like, the situation is funny, but, like, overall it's not that funny for the team itself.

6424
03:38:24,760 --> 03:38:28,720
But, like, it's a little funny when you think their team name is terrible teammates.

6425
03:38:28,880 --> 03:38:30,880
And, oh, they're getting diffed by Groot.

6426
03:38:30,900 --> 03:38:32,140
We definitely need to ban Groot.

6427
03:38:34,980 --> 03:38:37,760
I'm watching their- I'm watching their gameplay.

6428
03:38:38,260 --> 03:38:40,140
I'm watching their rank session right now.

6429
03:38:42,240 --> 03:38:46,320
They- we have- for some reason, we just have a Groot problem.

6430
03:38:47,060 --> 03:38:53,060
That's why, like, when we were playing rank, we were just banning Groot all the- we were just banning Rocket and Groot when we were doing rank last night.

6431
03:38:53,240 --> 03:38:57,120
We just- for some reason, we just have, like, a Groot debuff.

6432
03:38:59,920 --> 03:39:00,500
That's brief.

6433
03:39:00,620 --> 03:39:02,160
Oh, yeah, that's self-fulfilling prophecy.

6434
03:39:02,400 --> 03:39:02,680
Yeah.

6435
03:39:03,060 --> 03:39:06,000
I hope you guys are enjoying the Rivals tournament.

6436
03:39:06,340 --> 03:39:08,320
I hope you guys are enjoying the gameplay.

6437
03:39:08,680 --> 03:39:17,520
Because it is different from, you know, like, you know, we've done- we stream a lot of Apex tournaments, but Rivals is definitely- Marble Rivals as a tournament is definitely a lot different.

6438
03:39:19,760 --> 03:39:21,620
And I hope you guys have been enjoying it.

6439
03:39:21,640 --> 03:39:24,100
There's a lot more- obviously, there's a lot more people participating.

6440
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:29,040
And it's a lot more coordination compared to Apex and stuff.

6441
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:33,280
So, a lot more, like, talking and IGL-ing and comms and everything.

6442
03:39:34,860 --> 03:39:37,860
It's definitely very stressful, for sure.

6443
03:39:38,220 --> 03:39:44,360
But, like, I think, like, as a support player, it's less stressful for me versus, like, a DPS or tank, I feel like.

6444
03:39:44,360 --> 03:39:53,340
Because as a support player, I have much more- I have much more, like, safety, I guess?

6445
03:39:53,960 --> 03:40:09,400
To, like, not- Like, basically, my game-changing moves are things I can- are, like, my freezes and- But, like, nobody expects me to land these freezes and stuff like that.

6446
03:40:09,460 --> 03:40:13,240
So, like, if I- when I do land freezes, it's like, oh my god, that's, like, a bonus.

6447
03:40:14,500 --> 03:40:16,860
And then, like, obviously, like, ults and stuff.

6448
03:40:18,820 --> 03:40:22,360
It is, like- I think, like, the scariest has been...

6449
03:40:24,440 --> 03:40:37,680
I think, like, I don't know why, but- I don't know why, but for some reason, my ping for these games has been, like, wonky.

6450
03:40:37,800 --> 03:40:38,560
Like, weird.

6451
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:40,160
I don't know why.

6452
03:40:40,300 --> 03:40:48,460
Like, I don't know if you guys know, like, I usually time my ult- Like, I see my ult going off, but, like, nothing happens.

6453
03:40:48,620 --> 03:40:51,900
And it's, like- like, I get, like- what's the word?

6454
03:40:52,000 --> 03:40:52,960
I get...

6455
03:40:56,200 --> 03:41:01,120
Like, I see the visual of it going off, but then it, like, interrupts and it's just- it's weird.

6456
03:41:01,200 --> 03:41:01,480
I don't know.

6457
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:02,780
I've never had that happen.

6458
03:41:04,200 --> 03:41:06,600
And it happened to me, like, twice today.

6459
03:41:07,400 --> 03:41:09,360
We're playing- we should be playing East Coast.

6460
03:41:09,620 --> 03:41:13,440
But the fact that it happened to me twice was what's, like, really fucking weird.

6461
03:41:15,300 --> 03:41:15,660
Yeah.

6462
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:20,560
It's a- like, I usually never have that problem, too.

6463
03:41:22,200 --> 03:41:23,080
The- yeah.

6464
03:41:23,920 --> 03:41:27,220
It happened, like, two times that- during the tournament.

6465
03:41:27,440 --> 03:41:28,140
Like, just today.

6466
03:41:28,260 --> 03:41:29,320
Like, yesterday was fine.

6467
03:41:30,100 --> 03:41:34,200
I don't know if I just have to time- like, I just have to be- I don't- I shouldn't time it, like, to the dot.

6468
03:41:34,240 --> 03:41:41,300
I should just- I should just, like, ult it the moment, like, I just do it more reactionary.

6469
03:41:41,300 --> 03:41:48,360
Because I don't- I do- I do it- I do do reactionary, but, like, I'm, like, a .1 second off of reactionary.

6470
03:41:49,840 --> 03:41:53,040
I still have my ult- no, I keep my ult because it wasn't an interruption.

6471
03:41:53,500 --> 03:41:59,760
It's weird, because it wasn't even- it's not even an interruption, because I still keep my- keep my ult.

6472
03:42:00,040 --> 03:42:01,100
Oh, they ran 3-3.

6473
03:42:03,080 --> 03:42:05,280
Coney stole my MVP last second again.

6474
03:42:05,540 --> 03:42:07,180
Oh my god, you guys did it!

6475
03:42:07,540 --> 03:42:08,060
That's true.

6476
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:09,420
He did win the game for his team.

6477
03:42:09,420 --> 03:42:12,660
Oh my god, you guys- you guys did it!

6478
03:42:13,220 --> 03:42:14,960
You- you didn't see me at the end, bro.

6479
03:42:15,100 --> 03:42:15,860
I went foolish.

6480
03:42:16,060 --> 03:42:17,320
I got three solo kills.

6481
03:42:17,880 --> 03:42:18,800
I already did.

6482
03:42:21,320 --> 03:42:23,340
I don't know if they're ready or not.

6483
03:42:23,360 --> 03:42:24,740
This has been more than 40 minutes.

6484
03:42:25,020 --> 03:42:29,420
Yeah, this has been- let's- before you guys queue, let's check out- because, like, Maze's team is fighting...

6485
03:42:32,020 --> 03:42:36,920
Oh, the Maze's team has to- Yeah, they have to defend now, I think.

6486
03:42:37,900 --> 03:42:38,260
Yeah.

6487
03:42:38,860 --> 03:42:43,600
Because they're doing that- that game first, before they go to- like, they're finishing that game before they go to us.

6488
03:42:45,880 --> 03:42:48,020
So, they're- I believe they're- Oh, we're fighting Maze's team?

6489
03:42:48,320 --> 03:42:50,700
No, no, no, we're fighting Riggzy's team.

6490
03:42:51,400 --> 03:42:54,900
But- Oh, then why are they- I think because they want to spectate all the games.

6491
03:42:56,700 --> 03:42:57,320
That's why.

6492
03:43:00,450 --> 03:43:04,150
So, like, they're just- we're just spectating all the games and stuff.

6493
03:43:04,410 --> 03:43:05,570
I mean, we can double check.

6494
03:43:05,610 --> 03:43:06,590
I'll double check with them.

6495
03:43:06,590 --> 03:43:08,790
I'll be like, which- who do we add?

6496
03:43:09,430 --> 03:43:10,470
Do we add Whitey?

6497
03:43:12,030 --> 03:43:13,950
That's- that's his Discord username, by the way.

6498
03:43:14,050 --> 03:43:14,650
I got it to my chat.

6499
03:43:14,650 --> 03:43:17,190
Yeah, yeah, don't- don't trust- They've already yelled at me about it!

6500
03:43:17,450 --> 03:43:17,710
Little dokey!

6501
03:43:17,950 --> 03:43:21,010
Do we add- do we add- Michael called- called- said that to me, and I was like, wait, what?

6502
03:43:25,110 --> 03:43:29,790
Okay, I'm gonna add the user whose name is Whitey, by the way.

6503
03:43:29,830 --> 03:43:31,930
I'm not- I'm not pulling a lie move right now.

6504
03:43:32,870 --> 03:43:33,230
Hey!

6505
03:43:33,230 --> 03:43:34,330
Oh, no!

6506
03:43:35,110 --> 03:43:36,190
Uh-oh.

6507
03:43:39,050 --> 03:43:46,510
How- are we waiting for the loser bracket match to finish for our game?

6508
03:43:47,850 --> 03:43:48,230
Alright.

6509
03:43:49,990 --> 03:43:51,190
And then we'll know.

6510
03:43:53,770 --> 03:43:58,510
Or- or add any of the staff that's free.

6511
03:44:00,650 --> 03:44:05,510
Yeah, none of the staff are- I'll just add another staff member.

6512
03:44:10,490 --> 03:44:11,650
Do I have a second?

6513
03:44:11,810 --> 03:44:13,170
I just need to step away for a minute.

6514
03:44:13,590 --> 03:44:14,490
Yeah, yeah, we should have.

6515
03:44:16,410 --> 03:44:22,830
Alright, I added another staff member just to see if they say anything.

6516
03:44:23,070 --> 03:44:24,270
I wish we could add roles.

6517
03:44:25,810 --> 03:44:26,550
I'll be right back as well.

6518
03:44:26,790 --> 03:44:27,190
Alright.

6519
03:44:27,190 --> 03:44:27,750
Okay.

6520
03:44:28,110 --> 03:44:31,050
I think maybe- I don't know.

6521
03:44:31,390 --> 03:44:34,230
I think Mesa's team might defend as well.

6522
03:44:34,750 --> 03:44:36,710
I feel like if we just ban Groot, it'll be fine.

6523
03:44:36,770 --> 03:44:39,510
I don't understand why the enemy team doesn't ban Groot.

6524
03:44:44,960 --> 03:44:49,620
Oh, Whitey's typing a message.

6525
03:44:51,520 --> 03:44:55,180
Oh, yeah, we're waiting for Mesa's game to end before our game.

6526
03:44:55,180 --> 03:45:03,500
But they're- I mean, I don't think we can have time to queue another game because they're defending right now and they're doing pretty well defending.

6527
03:45:07,830 --> 03:45:12,630
Alright, I'm gonna swap my- I'm gonna swap my account.

6528
03:45:12,890 --> 03:45:14,050
Guys, give me a sec.

6529
03:45:14,230 --> 03:45:17,030
I'm gonna swap back to my main and then exist as a person again.

6530
03:45:18,610 --> 03:45:19,250
I'm gone.

6531
03:45:19,450 --> 03:45:20,330
I got a quick question.

6532
03:45:21,230 --> 03:45:27,010
My left ear has been blocked and it's not- like, I can tell it's just- I can't hear shit on my left ear.

6533
03:45:27,610 --> 03:45:28,610
How the hell do I fix this?

6534
03:45:28,870 --> 03:45:29,870
Wait, that- what?

6535
03:45:31,230 --> 03:45:34,890
Yeah, I can't- I've been- I've been having to deal with this for, like, the beginning of the tournament.

6536
03:45:35,430 --> 03:45:35,710
What?

6537
03:45:35,990 --> 03:45:37,530
I thought it'd go- I thought it'd go away by now.

6538
03:45:39,290 --> 03:45:40,250
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

6539
03:45:40,290 --> 03:45:41,070
I don't know what it is, actually.

6540
03:45:41,090 --> 03:45:42,610
Like, can you not hear anything at all?

6541
03:45:43,170 --> 03:45:44,110
Oh, no, I can still hear.

6542
03:45:44,230 --> 03:45:45,070
It's just really- Oh, okay, okay.

6543
03:45:45,090 --> 03:45:46,330
I was gonna say- On my left ear.

6544
03:45:46,970 --> 03:45:48,010
Have you cleaned your ears?

6545
03:45:49,110 --> 03:45:49,610
I did.

6546
03:45:50,390 --> 03:45:50,670
Oh.

6547
03:45:51,550 --> 03:45:51,830
Oh.

6548
03:45:51,830 --> 03:45:53,850
So, I'm like- I'm like, uh, and I don't know what's happening.

6549
03:45:54,390 --> 03:45:55,670
Oh, blowing your nose.

6550
03:45:56,210 --> 03:45:56,850
I'm gonna do that.

6551
03:45:57,030 --> 03:45:57,490
Hold on.

6552
03:45:57,590 --> 03:46:00,570
What if he just, like, bursts his eardrums by doing that?

6553
03:46:01,590 --> 03:46:01,810
Oh.

6554
03:46:01,890 --> 03:46:02,270
Oh, God.

6555
03:46:02,910 --> 03:46:04,150
Oh, now I'm giving you that fear.

6556
03:46:05,470 --> 03:46:06,290
I'm doing it anyway.

6557
03:46:06,370 --> 03:46:07,490
She's in your head, dude.

6558
03:46:11,850 --> 03:46:12,750
Nope, that didn't do shit.

6559
03:46:13,510 --> 03:46:14,450
All right, let me clean my ear again.

6560
03:46:15,130 --> 03:46:16,750
Okay, we're having a lot of, like, hearing problems.

6561
03:46:16,750 --> 03:46:22,430
We're having a lot of, like, yeah, like, in the audio, for some reason, like, people just don't want us to listen to anything.

6562
03:46:23,190 --> 03:46:23,590
Like...

6563
03:46:25,130 --> 03:46:26,650
Okay, I'm gonna swap my account.

6564
03:46:26,690 --> 03:46:27,130
This is weird.

6565
03:46:27,410 --> 03:46:28,350
Goodbye, Medoc.

6566
03:46:30,170 --> 03:46:31,030
Oh, how are they doing?

6567
03:46:31,250 --> 03:46:34,210
It seems like they're doing pretty well against Riggzy's team.

6568
03:46:34,290 --> 03:46:37,750
Um, no, no, this is- they got- they got knocked out by Riggzy's team.

6569
03:46:37,830 --> 03:46:39,010
So, they're fighting somebody else now.

6570
03:46:39,170 --> 03:46:41,070
They're doing- they're in loser's bracket because of it.

6571
03:46:43,890 --> 03:46:45,590
They can come back to winner's bracket, right?

6572
03:46:45,790 --> 03:46:46,430
Yeah, they can.

6573
03:46:46,670 --> 03:46:51,410
If we get- it's whoever- it's either Riggzy or us that fight Maze.

6574
03:46:51,410 --> 03:46:57,210
So, if we fight- if we win Riggzy- the game against Riggzy, Riggzy's just gonna knock them out.

6575
03:46:57,970 --> 03:47:00,350
And then, we fight Riggzy's team again.

6576
03:47:00,650 --> 03:47:04,410
Or, I don't know, Maze's team might figure out how to fucking kill them.

6577
03:47:04,850 --> 03:47:11,150
Um, but, what- no matter what, we- I- but if we lose, we fight his team, and then we fight Riggzy's team again.

6578
03:47:12,650 --> 03:47:17,250
So, we might have a grand finals where we just fight Riggzy's team twice in a row.

6579
03:47:21,660 --> 03:47:24,000
Um, I think Maze is gonna defend this.

6580
03:47:24,140 --> 03:47:25,260
Yeah, they- they win this.

6581
03:47:25,740 --> 03:47:26,940
They win this game.

6582
03:47:30,250 --> 03:47:31,270
Let me log in.

6583
03:47:31,970 --> 03:47:35,090
Let me look at our bans during our scrims again.

6584
03:47:35,410 --> 03:47:37,730
And I'll paste the images for us.

6585
03:47:44,500 --> 03:47:45,960
Oh, 15 minutes.

6586
03:47:46,240 --> 03:47:48,100
Oh, 15 minutes till our- our game.

6587
03:47:49,240 --> 03:47:49,760
Fifteen!

6588
03:47:50,940 --> 03:47:51,460
Okay.

6589
03:47:52,020 --> 03:47:52,280
Oh.

6590
03:47:53,320 --> 03:47:53,840
Oh!

6591
03:47:54,600 --> 03:47:55,940
Oh, I'm not nervous.

6592
03:47:55,940 --> 03:47:57,440
Nico, has I heard you talking about your ear?

6593
03:47:58,440 --> 03:48:01,120
Uh, I had my ear plugged up for, like, three months straight.

6594
03:48:02,260 --> 03:48:02,380
Yeah?

6595
03:48:02,380 --> 03:48:05,340
And, like, it was to the point where it was, like, making me dizzy and giving me a headache.

6596
03:48:05,520 --> 03:48:07,200
Like, and it just stopped one day.

6597
03:48:07,360 --> 03:48:08,340
Like, nothing fixed it.

6598
03:48:08,440 --> 03:48:09,500
It just...

6599
03:48:09,880 --> 03:48:11,440
Yeah, I'm confused about it right now.

6600
03:48:11,540 --> 03:48:14,340
It's- it's just- I just cleared out my ear and, like, oh, it's clean.

6601
03:48:14,400 --> 03:48:15,420
And then, oh, never mind.

6602
03:48:16,360 --> 03:48:17,840
Just, like, didn't do anything.

6603
03:48:17,880 --> 03:48:19,100
Were you sick recently, or?

6604
03:48:19,980 --> 03:48:20,300
No.

6605
03:48:21,420 --> 03:48:22,280
That's why I'm confused.

6606
03:48:22,840 --> 03:48:24,400
You might- Oh, you know what it was?

6607
03:48:24,400 --> 03:48:25,020
What?

6608
03:48:25,880 --> 03:48:27,180
Oh, I know what it is.

6609
03:48:27,300 --> 03:48:30,300
I think- I think, like, I plugged up my ear when I was sleeping.

6610
03:48:31,560 --> 03:48:32,820
And usually something like that happens.

6611
03:48:33,060 --> 03:48:34,800
Or, like, something related to that happens.

6612
03:48:36,660 --> 03:48:38,800
Ooh, I slept on my- my left side too hard.

6613
03:48:39,600 --> 03:48:40,320
Oh, no.

6614
03:48:41,140 --> 03:48:43,400
No- no air- Oh, no.

6615
03:48:43,400 --> 03:48:44,400
Yeah, no air flow to the ear.

6616
03:48:44,740 --> 03:48:45,160
Oh, boy.

6617
03:48:46,420 --> 03:48:48,940
I don't think- I don't think people want us to win.

6618
03:48:49,060 --> 03:48:53,140
Like- Wait, what?

6619
03:48:54,780 --> 03:48:58,780
Like, everything, like, the- everything is going against our team.

6620
03:49:02,460 --> 03:49:07,840
People just don't, like- even the powers beyond are, like, this team can't win.

6621
03:49:08,340 --> 03:49:10,560
It's not- it's not supposed to happen.

6622
03:49:12,520 --> 03:49:14,260
They're fighting against us.

6623
03:49:17,360 --> 03:49:22,260
I'm- I'm gonna grab screenshots of, like, our ban line against Rixie's team.

6624
03:49:24,280 --> 03:49:24,480
Okay.

6625
03:49:25,220 --> 03:49:28,680
So, just to remember what we did, because I don't fully remember.

6626
03:49:34,490 --> 03:49:36,890
I'm trying not to be too nervous.

6627
03:49:37,850 --> 03:49:40,450
I'm trying not to be too nervous, guys.

6628
03:49:42,950 --> 03:49:50,490
No, we knew, since the very beginning, Rixie's team was the strongest- was gonna be the strongest in the tournament.

6629
03:49:51,730 --> 03:49:57,790
Because, like, the first- the first scrim we played against- this was our very first scrim, too, as a team.

6630
03:49:58,190 --> 03:50:01,390
They, like- they banned Beto's Mag.

6631
03:50:02,030 --> 03:50:06,630
And then we got absolutely- we got, like, not destroyed- we got, like- okay, we sort of got destroyed.

6632
03:50:06,630 --> 03:50:10,570
Because that time, Beto could only play Mag, but now he can play other characters.

6633
03:50:12,050 --> 03:50:22,950
And then when we- when we- when we, um, figured out- When we figured them out, we started- we won all our scrims after that.

6634
03:50:23,110 --> 03:50:25,430
When we figured them out, because we scrimmed them twice.

6635
03:50:25,910 --> 03:50:28,590
And then the second time we scrimmed them, we beat them.

6636
03:50:29,390 --> 03:50:32,230
So, like, they are- they are a really good team.

6637
03:50:32,750 --> 03:50:33,990
They've been scrimming a lot, too.

6638
03:50:33,990 --> 03:50:38,670
They've been scrimming a lot, and they have a very strong team overall.

6639
03:50:39,740 --> 03:50:44,290
I want that OmNomNom team to lose after that- after that lobby talk.

6640
03:50:45,930 --> 03:50:46,710
They did.

6641
03:50:46,910 --> 03:50:47,790
They just lost.

6642
03:50:48,770 --> 03:50:49,570
They lost.

6643
03:50:49,610 --> 03:50:51,190
They just lost to Maze, yeah.

6644
03:50:51,830 --> 03:50:53,270
Oh, VTuber's a little slow, then.

6645
03:50:53,350 --> 03:50:53,990
The mainstream.

6646
03:50:55,770 --> 03:50:57,030
Yeah, they lost.

6647
03:50:57,450 --> 03:50:57,730
Yeah.

6648
03:50:58,290 --> 03:50:59,410
Which team lost?

6649
03:50:59,650 --> 03:50:59,650
Sorry.

6650
03:51:00,550 --> 03:51:01,090
OmNomNom.

6651
03:51:01,890 --> 03:51:02,330
OmNomNom.

6652
03:51:02,430 --> 03:51:05,250
This is like a weird passive aggression.

6653
03:51:07,210 --> 03:51:08,310
The Shrug Team.

6654
03:51:08,510 --> 03:51:08,990
The Shrug Team.

6655
03:51:09,190 --> 03:51:11,630
Or Bro with a question- or a period.

6656
03:51:11,630 --> 03:51:12,010
The dot?

6657
03:51:12,110 --> 03:51:12,530
The period?

6658
03:51:12,870 --> 03:51:13,310
Yeah, the period.

6659
03:51:13,570 --> 03:51:14,650
Yeah, oh my god.

6660
03:51:15,150 --> 03:51:16,910
The full-settled Bro was a bit, yeah.

6661
03:51:17,310 --> 03:51:18,570
Yeah, he did too much.

6662
03:51:18,930 --> 03:51:19,810
Somebody to call for, yeah.

6663
03:51:22,850 --> 03:51:31,070
Like, I know, like, if, like, they had that happen, we'd say it- Like, we'll say it to our- to us, but we wouldn't say it to them.

6664
03:51:31,090 --> 03:51:32,850
Yeah, you don't say it in the chat.

6665
03:51:33,090 --> 03:51:35,470
It's like, oh, Bro, that's like, oh well.

6666
03:51:35,550 --> 03:51:39,230
But we wouldn't say it, so the other, like, they'll see it.

6667
03:51:39,810 --> 03:51:40,210
No.

6668
03:51:41,690 --> 03:51:42,390
There's a difference.

6669
03:51:42,630 --> 03:51:43,550
Yeah, there's a difference.

6670
03:51:43,670 --> 03:51:47,550
Like, we shit talk on stream, but we don't shit talk directly at them.

6671
03:51:48,130 --> 03:51:49,750
You shit talk in stream, it's not real.

6672
03:51:49,890 --> 03:51:51,370
Yeah, exactly, it's not real.

6673
03:51:52,830 --> 03:51:54,130
We're just clip farming.

6674
03:51:57,770 --> 03:51:59,570
Oh, we're going to lobby.

6675
03:52:00,290 --> 03:52:01,110
Oh, this is it?

6676
03:52:01,410 --> 03:52:01,990
Are we ready?

6677
03:52:03,430 --> 03:52:05,570
We go in the lobby, but we still have time.

6678
03:52:05,750 --> 03:52:10,990
I think they're going to play- they're playing this set out, and then they're going to...

6679
03:52:11,650 --> 03:52:12,730
They're dead, aren't they?

6680
03:52:12,810 --> 03:52:13,810
They won their match.

6681
03:52:15,550 --> 03:52:16,530
Oh, that was loser.

6682
03:52:16,570 --> 03:52:17,730
Yeah, that was loser.

6683
03:52:17,810 --> 03:52:18,710
You only get one game.

6684
03:52:20,070 --> 03:52:27,610
I'm trying to- I'm looking at- I'm trying to find, like, what we banned and stuff.

6685
03:52:29,570 --> 03:52:33,270
We went against them, and then we started doing Bucky bans here, I believe.

6686
03:52:35,110 --> 03:52:35,950
Yeah, this is it.

6687
03:52:36,030 --> 03:52:37,210
This is where we started winning.

6688
03:52:44,930 --> 03:52:49,530
This is the team lineup when we started winning.

6689
03:52:50,890 --> 03:52:51,790
I'll screenshot this.

6690
03:52:52,950 --> 03:52:55,150
Surely in losers finals we get best of three, right?

6691
03:52:56,230 --> 03:52:57,950
Losers finals is best of three.

6692
03:52:57,950 --> 03:52:58,430
Okay, good.

6693
03:52:58,890 --> 03:53:01,210
So if we lose this, it's best of three still.

6694
03:53:01,490 --> 03:53:01,870
Is it?

6695
03:53:01,890 --> 03:53:02,110
Okay.

6696
03:53:02,110 --> 03:53:03,070
We don't worry.

6697
03:53:03,450 --> 03:53:04,110
Okay, um...

6698
03:53:08,670 --> 03:53:12,390
Why were you on- wait, oh, because we got a mag unbanned.

6699
03:53:12,490 --> 03:53:18,810
I was wondering why- why did we have a Scarlet Witch in one of our games?

6700
03:53:20,850 --> 03:53:22,870
Why are they asking if we're appearing offline?

6701
03:53:23,890 --> 03:53:24,650
I have no idea.

6702
03:53:25,750 --> 03:53:27,450
Here, these are our ban lines.

6703
03:53:27,550 --> 03:53:28,590
I'm posting it for us.

6704
03:53:28,590 --> 03:53:33,950
Are we doing Bucky Sue, right?

6705
03:53:34,050 --> 03:53:34,950
And protecting Strange?

6706
03:53:36,170 --> 03:53:38,890
Or not protecting Strange, protecting the thing?

6707
03:53:41,270 --> 03:53:42,730
I believe so, yeah.

6708
03:53:43,450 --> 03:53:45,570
Because we always ban Bucky first.

6709
03:53:47,850 --> 03:53:48,970
Kill Bucky save thing.

6710
03:53:49,750 --> 03:53:50,030
Yeah.

6711
03:53:51,850 --> 03:53:53,210
Oh, it's this team, that's right.

6712
03:53:53,310 --> 03:53:53,450
Okay.

6713
03:53:54,930 --> 03:53:55,490
Alright.

6714
03:53:58,690 --> 03:54:03,050
There was one- we did a protect- oh, and then if they ban...

6715
03:54:03,050 --> 03:54:08,190
Oh, and then when they ban a thing first, we protected mag and wiped them.

6716
03:54:09,150 --> 03:54:09,550
Yeah.

6717
03:54:10,150 --> 03:54:12,470
Yeah, that's fine, because Betel can play Strange, I'll play mag.

6718
03:54:12,730 --> 03:54:13,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6719
03:54:14,610 --> 03:54:15,590
No, Betel was on mag.

6720
03:54:16,070 --> 03:54:17,970
Doki, they think you're posting the end game screens.

6721
03:54:18,150 --> 03:54:18,870
I think they're freaking out.

6722
03:54:19,070 --> 03:54:19,910
Oh, no.

6723
03:54:21,630 --> 03:54:24,610
No, we are posting our scrims results.

6724
03:54:24,610 --> 03:54:31,230
That's gotta be very confusing.

6725
03:54:39,060 --> 03:54:41,440
They're like, you already fought them?

6726
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:44,740
That would be like, oops.

6727
03:54:46,580 --> 03:54:50,520
It's like tagging the leader of the event, it's like, oh no, what are we going to do?

6728
03:54:51,940 --> 03:54:53,760
They already have their games!

6729
03:54:54,680 --> 03:54:55,480
We won!

6730
03:54:55,600 --> 03:54:58,440
Yeah, send them down to the loser's bracket.

6731
03:54:58,440 --> 03:54:58,740
Dude.

6732
03:55:05,320 --> 03:55:06,440
Oh, okay.

6733
03:55:07,760 --> 03:55:09,820
Alright, figured out our plan.

6734
03:55:10,300 --> 03:55:14,560
So you think running triple tank, triple support would be best against them?

6735
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:19,520
Yeah, that's our... well, if they don't ban...

6736
03:55:22,280 --> 03:55:25,440
I think if they don't ban mag, we just...

6737
03:55:25,440 --> 03:55:30,980
Yeah, when they don't ban mag, we can run our double 2-2-2, because we full held them, remember?

6738
03:55:32,840 --> 03:55:33,280
Yeah.

6739
03:55:34,160 --> 03:55:36,320
We full held them when they didn't ban mag.

6740
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:40,180
I remember, right, it was on...

6741
03:55:40,180 --> 03:55:44,480
And then they started banning mag again, and then they're like, Beto, you can't play the game anymore.

6742
03:55:45,540 --> 03:55:46,420
I remember.

6743
03:55:57,240 --> 03:56:00,140
We only went 3-3-3 when they...

6744
03:56:01,420 --> 03:56:03,640
I don't remember, why...

6745
03:56:03,640 --> 03:56:06,340
I think 3-3-3 is the strongest against them, though.

6746
03:56:06,440 --> 03:56:08,080
They don't know what to do when we go 3-3-3.

6747
03:56:08,460 --> 03:56:10,240
Unless they discovered an answer.

6748
03:56:12,800 --> 03:56:16,540
But here's the thing, they haven't scrimmed, though, with people that also did that.

6749
03:56:16,540 --> 03:56:17,880
Yeah, they don't know, yeah.

6750
03:56:18,320 --> 03:56:25,880
So we could go 3-3-3, because we absolutely countered them hard with 3-3-3.

6751
03:56:27,240 --> 03:56:33,720
But I think if mag is free, if we can play mag, I don't think we have to run 3-3-3.

6752
03:56:37,550 --> 03:56:42,870
Because we full held them with 2-2-2.

6753
03:56:51,560 --> 03:56:53,260
What were we waiting on?

6754
03:56:54,580 --> 03:56:58,160
Yeah, we did full hold them with 2-2-2 when we had mag.

6755
03:56:59,300 --> 03:57:05,160
That's if we... Oh my god, if they give us Namor and Luna and Starlord and mag...

6756
03:57:05,740 --> 03:57:06,840
Just everything, yeah.

6757
03:57:09,160 --> 03:57:11,740
If we just don't have bans, yeah.

6758
03:57:13,320 --> 03:57:18,280
Let's just do a competitive game where we don't even ban anything.

6759
03:57:20,700 --> 03:57:22,280
Let's see how it goes.

6760
03:57:24,460 --> 03:57:26,800
That should be the grand finals, no bans.

6761
03:57:31,300 --> 03:57:35,220
I wonder if we're waiting on... Are we waiting on...

6762
03:57:37,240 --> 03:57:40,420
Because they said add... Oh wait, you have the caster, right?

6763
03:57:42,360 --> 03:57:43,380
No, Gomez does.

6764
03:57:43,780 --> 03:57:45,940
Oh, the Ana one?

6765
03:57:47,720 --> 03:57:49,020
No, I don't have her.

6766
03:57:50,660 --> 03:57:51,320
Where's Gomez?

6767
03:57:51,880 --> 03:57:52,880
Is he still fixing his ear?

6768
03:57:54,480 --> 03:57:55,380
He might be.

6769
03:57:57,840 --> 03:57:59,940
Yeah, I think he's still fixing his ear.

6770
03:58:03,140 --> 03:58:05,700
I'm like pulled up his stream just to be sure.

6771
03:58:08,540 --> 03:58:09,060
Hello?

6772
03:58:09,520 --> 03:58:10,040
Oh hey.

6773
03:58:10,920 --> 03:58:15,060
You have the caster on your friends list, we have to join the lobby.

6774
03:58:17,420 --> 03:58:18,400
The Ana person.

6775
03:58:19,840 --> 03:58:22,140
Alright, hold on, I gotta swap accounts.

6776
03:58:22,720 --> 03:58:24,380
Oh, you're still on the other account?

6777
03:58:24,740 --> 03:58:26,100
Yeah, I'm bot reviewing someone.

6778
03:58:26,500 --> 03:58:28,060
You're bot reviewing our tournament?

6779
03:58:28,240 --> 03:58:29,300
We have a tournament!

6780
03:58:29,300 --> 03:58:29,700
We have a tournament!

6781
03:58:32,340 --> 03:58:37,220
Alright, let me... Oh, I thought you guys were in... Okay, those are your guys' mains.

6782
03:58:40,500 --> 03:58:41,620
Yeah, I'm on my main.

6783
03:58:46,630 --> 03:58:47,690
I'm ready, I'm ready.

6784
03:58:50,170 --> 03:58:53,030
Okay, so... Did you hear what we were talking about earlier?

6785
03:58:53,350 --> 03:58:53,930
About the ban?

6786
03:58:54,030 --> 03:58:55,810
I posted screenshots of our scrim bans.

6787
03:58:57,750 --> 03:58:58,430
What are we doing?

6788
03:58:59,390 --> 03:59:01,950
We're doing Bucky first, but we're talking about the comp.

6789
03:59:02,070 --> 03:59:03,330
Do we run 3-3?

6790
03:59:03,890 --> 03:59:07,430
Or if they don't ban Mag, should we run 2-2-2?

6791
03:59:07,550 --> 03:59:10,070
Because we full helped them with 2-2-2 when we had Mag.

6792
03:59:14,250 --> 03:59:17,350
And then when Mag is banned, we run 3-3.

6793
03:59:19,690 --> 03:59:20,450
Sorry, hold on.

6794
03:59:20,490 --> 03:59:23,810
I think I ate something bad because I'm feeling so nauseous right now.

6795
03:59:24,090 --> 03:59:25,670
What is going on?!

6796
03:59:25,670 --> 03:59:27,050
I don't know what's going on.

6797
03:59:27,590 --> 03:59:29,730
I'm feeling like trash at the moment.

6798
03:59:32,130 --> 03:59:33,670
Do you have any medicine?

6799
03:59:35,710 --> 03:59:37,010
I have Pepto.

6800
03:59:37,370 --> 03:59:38,690
I'll probably go drink that real quick.

6801
03:59:39,330 --> 03:59:41,130
Did you just start feeling sick?

6802
03:59:41,470 --> 03:59:43,690
It's like your stomach is not easy right now.

6803
03:59:44,510 --> 03:59:48,450
Yeah, it feels like I have to go to the bathroom, but not really.

6804
03:59:48,690 --> 03:59:52,090
But then also, if I think about food, I just...

6805
03:59:53,090 --> 03:59:54,690
Do you have to go to the bathroom right now?

6806
03:59:55,550 --> 03:59:56,370
Just don't think of food.

6807
03:59:57,050 --> 03:59:59,630
Think of, I don't know, portals.

6808
04:00:16,650 --> 04:00:18,570
Do you have Pepto?

6809
04:00:19,610 --> 04:00:22,150
Yeah, I can go take a quick Pepto.

6810
04:00:22,390 --> 04:00:23,070
What is going on?

6811
04:00:23,170 --> 04:00:24,450
I can't hear in my left ear.

6812
04:00:24,930 --> 04:00:26,170
I'm feeling nauseous.

6813
04:00:26,170 --> 04:00:27,170
What's going on?

6814
04:00:27,930 --> 04:00:28,470
I don't know.

6815
04:00:29,230 --> 04:00:31,350
Did you even leave the team in Africa?

6816
04:00:31,730 --> 04:00:32,090
Yeah.

6817
04:00:33,890 --> 04:00:35,430
No one wants us to win, guys.

6818
04:00:38,730 --> 04:00:40,430
I have some sparkling water.

6819
04:00:40,550 --> 04:00:43,770
I'm going to drink this a bit and see if it makes me feel better.

6820
04:00:49,010 --> 04:00:51,290
Apparently, the moment you rejoin the lobby, they're starting.

6821
04:00:53,430 --> 04:00:54,910
They're waiting for us at the moment.

6822
04:00:57,130 --> 04:00:57,530
Okay.

6823
04:00:57,530 --> 04:01:01,970
I guess not all of us join because they might start right away.

6824
04:01:06,450 --> 04:01:08,990
I'll just say Gomez is getting medicine right now.

6825
04:01:09,590 --> 04:01:11,530
We will let you know when our...

6826
04:01:14,570 --> 04:01:17,350
You go get your medicine.

6827
04:01:17,610 --> 04:01:18,770
I'll invite Choto in.

6828
04:01:19,130 --> 04:01:19,670
I'll be right back.

6829
04:01:23,840 --> 04:01:24,240
Alright.

6830
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:26,900
Oh, my God.

6831
04:01:28,480 --> 04:01:29,340
Oh, my God.

6832
04:01:29,360 --> 04:01:31,360
Did he use a Q-tip to clean his ears?

6833
04:01:33,020 --> 04:01:33,820
No way.

6834
04:01:34,620 --> 04:01:36,320
You're not supposed to do that.

6835
04:01:37,180 --> 04:01:37,840
I think he did.

6836
04:01:37,940 --> 04:01:39,900
Maybe that's why he had a headache, too.

6837
04:01:40,080 --> 04:01:40,920
Or he's feeling nauseous.

6838
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:42,840
Oh, my God.

6839
04:01:42,840 --> 04:01:43,400
That makes sense.

6840
04:01:44,180 --> 04:01:44,800
I don't know.

6841
04:01:44,840 --> 04:01:46,920
Some of my chat said he might have used a Q-tip.

6842
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:51,680
If it works, it works, I guess.

6843
04:01:51,860 --> 04:01:54,240
But the thing is, it didn't work, chat.

6844
04:01:57,100 --> 04:01:58,000
Here's the thing.

6845
04:01:58,120 --> 04:02:03,300
It's probably the tubes in his head, bro.

6846
04:02:03,480 --> 04:02:06,180
When your ear gets like that, your tubes are all fucked up.

6847
04:02:06,760 --> 04:02:06,960
Yeah.

6848
04:02:07,820 --> 04:02:08,980
It's not really a way to fix it.

6849
04:02:10,200 --> 04:02:10,460
Oh.

6850
04:02:11,360 --> 04:02:12,980
It might not be a Pepto thing, then.

6851
04:02:13,360 --> 04:02:14,560
You just got to like...

6852
04:02:14,560 --> 04:02:16,060
It's his stomach, too.

6853
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:18,440
Yeah, I don't know about the stomach.

6854
04:02:18,680 --> 04:02:21,120
If he's getting nauseous, then that's affecting his balance.

6855
04:02:21,400 --> 04:02:22,820
It means he has a disease.

6856
04:02:23,020 --> 04:02:24,440
His ear is just congested.

6857
04:02:24,540 --> 04:02:27,700
I do EU, but was requested for this server.

6858
04:02:27,860 --> 04:02:29,020
Wait, what server are we playing on?

6859
04:02:29,120 --> 04:02:29,740
Does it tell us?

6860
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:32,680
North Virginia?

6861
04:02:33,200 --> 04:02:35,200
Is the top right the server we're playing on?

6862
04:02:35,280 --> 04:02:35,980
Or is it for me?

6863
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:36,800
Okay, thank God.

6864
04:02:36,840 --> 04:02:38,180
I was going to be like, what the fuck?

6865
04:02:38,180 --> 04:02:38,520
Like...

6866
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:43,100
So, I had an ear thing a few months ago.

6867
04:02:43,140 --> 04:02:44,840
Like I said, it lasted really long.

6868
04:02:45,060 --> 04:02:49,220
And I tried to play F-Zero, and it made me sick.

6869
04:02:49,500 --> 04:02:50,440
Because of the balance thing.

6870
04:02:51,060 --> 04:02:51,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6871
04:02:51,500 --> 04:02:52,340
I've never been like that.

6872
04:02:53,480 --> 04:02:55,540
And I couldn't even sit up.

6873
04:02:55,640 --> 04:02:57,080
But it doesn't usually hit this quickly.

6874
04:02:58,400 --> 04:02:59,260
That's crazy.

6875
04:02:59,720 --> 04:03:00,140
Yeah.

6876
04:03:00,980 --> 04:03:02,240
That's actually insane.

6877
04:03:04,640 --> 04:03:05,920
It affects your balance, though.

6878
04:03:05,960 --> 04:03:07,500
Like the fluid and all the stuff.

6879
04:03:07,560 --> 04:03:08,440
It's like really bad.

6880
04:03:09,580 --> 04:03:13,080
I mean, if you get it for months, that's actually crazy that you got it for months, though.

6881
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:14,540
Like, that's not...

6882
04:03:14,540 --> 04:03:15,580
You got that?

6883
04:03:16,720 --> 04:03:18,080
What did the doctor say?

6884
04:03:18,880 --> 04:03:19,160
Dude.

6885
04:03:19,680 --> 04:03:22,440
I went to the doctor, so it was plugged up for months.

6886
04:03:22,520 --> 04:03:26,280
But the problem is like, I go to the doctor, and they're like, yeah, it's not on the outside, so it's just your tubes.

6887
04:03:26,440 --> 04:03:27,060
And I'm like, alright.

6888
04:03:27,400 --> 04:03:28,300
What do I do about it?

6889
04:03:28,300 --> 04:03:31,840
They're like, well, because you would get ear infections a lot.

6890
04:03:32,040 --> 04:03:33,720
And they're like, well, there's just fluid in there.

6891
04:03:34,080 --> 04:03:34,980
Well, you do surgery.

6892
04:03:35,220 --> 04:03:36,580
And I'm like, I don't want to do that.

6893
04:03:36,720 --> 04:03:38,400
They're like, alright, well, just wait.

6894
04:03:38,520 --> 04:03:39,600
And then I did, and it fixed.

6895
04:03:40,300 --> 04:03:41,100
Just wait.

6896
04:03:41,400 --> 04:03:42,240
I saw the exact same thing.

6897
04:03:42,920 --> 04:03:43,580
Yeah, dude.

6898
04:03:43,660 --> 04:03:44,380
Isn't it bad?

6899
04:03:44,680 --> 04:03:47,680
Because I had ear tubes as a kid and got a lot of ear infections.

6900
04:03:48,020 --> 04:03:54,320
And then last year, I was dizzy and like bedridden for like two months due to like my equilibrium being off of my ears.

6901
04:03:54,580 --> 04:03:55,500
Oh, my God.

6902
04:03:56,260 --> 04:03:56,920
It's bad.

6903
04:03:56,920 --> 04:04:01,520
That sounds fucking... and it's because of the... and that's why you don't use Q-tips, guys.

6904
04:04:01,620 --> 04:04:03,020
That's why you don't use Q-tips.

6905
04:04:03,020 --> 04:04:03,660
No, it's not!

6906
04:04:05,300 --> 04:04:07,080
That's a different situation.

6907
04:04:08,820 --> 04:04:09,820
It's not bad, though.

6908
04:04:12,930 --> 04:04:13,650
That's crazy.

6909
04:04:14,070 --> 04:04:14,350
Yeah.

6910
04:04:14,590 --> 04:04:15,410
Yeah, it was awful.

6911
04:04:15,570 --> 04:04:22,370
And like, the worst part is you can't like... like, I don't know if anyone sees this, but I went to the doctor and they were like, it looks fine to us.

6912
04:04:22,510 --> 04:04:23,050
And I was like, yeah.

6913
04:04:24,250 --> 04:04:26,050
And they were like, well, you could go see a specialist.

6914
04:04:26,130 --> 04:04:28,310
I saw the specialist and they were like, it looks fine to me.

6915
04:04:28,430 --> 04:04:28,910
I'm like, what?

6916
04:04:29,290 --> 04:04:29,470
Okay.

6917
04:04:29,610 --> 04:04:30,610
How much did you pay for it?

6918
04:04:30,770 --> 04:04:31,310
Dude, I paid to get an ENT.

6919
04:04:32,330 --> 04:04:32,970
Oh, really?

6920
04:04:34,710 --> 04:04:35,030
Yeah.

6921
04:04:35,030 --> 04:04:37,230
You didn't even like talk to the specialist doctor at that time?

6922
04:04:37,410 --> 04:04:38,770
No, the ENT wait was like four months.

6923
04:04:39,390 --> 04:04:40,250
Oh, my God.

6924
04:04:40,490 --> 04:04:42,070
I'm being told pickles are good with nausea.

6925
04:04:42,170 --> 04:04:42,610
Is that true?

6926
04:04:43,150 --> 04:04:43,670
I don't know.

6927
04:04:43,970 --> 04:04:44,370
Is it true?

6928
04:04:44,690 --> 04:04:45,690
Just Google it.

6929
04:04:46,150 --> 04:04:46,910
Don't eat food.

6930
04:04:46,970 --> 04:04:47,890
Just don't eat food, bro.

6931
04:04:47,950 --> 04:04:48,390
Just don't eat.

6932
04:04:48,390 --> 04:04:49,270
Yeah, just don't eat anything.

6933
04:04:49,350 --> 04:04:49,990
I feel like you might...

6934
04:04:49,990 --> 04:04:50,790
Oh, he's hungry.

6935
04:04:52,230 --> 04:04:53,210
I'm hungry, though.

6936
04:04:53,750 --> 04:04:55,030
I'm nauseous, but I'm hungry.

6937
04:04:56,690 --> 04:04:57,790
Wait, what did you eat for breakfast?

6938
04:05:00,170 --> 04:05:00,890
Just eggs.

6939
04:05:01,310 --> 04:05:01,810
Eggs and rice.

6940
04:05:02,270 --> 04:05:03,690
Oh, it may be bad eggs.

6941
04:05:04,250 --> 04:05:06,730
Oh, I may have just ate bad eggs.

6942
04:05:07,030 --> 04:05:07,250
Oh.

6943
04:05:07,610 --> 04:05:07,970
No.

6944
04:05:09,090 --> 04:05:09,810
Oh, no.

6945
04:05:10,130 --> 04:05:11,070
Are you fucking kidding me?

6946
04:05:11,230 --> 04:05:12,850
Do you like want to throw up right now?

6947
04:05:12,870 --> 04:05:13,830
Like, how bad is it?

6948
04:05:14,710 --> 04:05:17,790
No, I don't feel... I do feel like I want to throw up, but it's just like...

6949
04:05:18,490 --> 04:05:20,850
If I think about it, my stomach grumbles.

6950
04:05:23,130 --> 04:05:23,530
Okay.

6951
04:05:23,670 --> 04:05:27,410
Do we just want to blast through it as quickly as we can before you explode?

6952
04:05:28,430 --> 04:05:29,530
That would be nice.

6953
04:05:29,850 --> 04:05:31,170
Would you be able to aim?

6954
04:05:32,030 --> 04:05:33,430
Yeah, like, okay, I'll do R.

6955
04:05:33,530 --> 04:05:34,070
I'll do R.

6956
04:05:35,270 --> 04:05:37,330
Would you be able to aim, Gomez?

6957
04:05:38,090 --> 04:05:39,950
Yeah, I just... I don't think I can comm.

6958
04:05:40,130 --> 04:05:42,170
I think I just have to be silent.

6959
04:05:42,290 --> 04:05:45,910
Okay, I guess I'll pick up the comms then for us.

6960
04:05:46,610 --> 04:05:49,230
No, I'll try to, but it's like...

6961
04:05:49,850 --> 04:05:52,030
We only need to win two more sets.

6962
04:05:52,290 --> 04:05:52,510
Yeah.

6963
04:05:54,110 --> 04:05:57,230
I think there will be a... Wait, are they running us after?

6964
04:05:57,270 --> 04:05:58,050
I'm going to check the schedule.

6965
04:05:58,190 --> 04:05:58,890
It'll probably be a break.

6966
04:05:59,230 --> 04:06:01,750
Yeah, I was going to say, are we going to have a break after?

6967
04:06:01,970 --> 04:06:07,790
If we're going to have a break after, like, I think Gomez might need to try and get something for himself.

6968
04:06:08,310 --> 04:06:09,290
That was the sickness.

6969
04:06:09,950 --> 04:06:13,230
How did it not occur in the 40-minute break we had?

6970
04:06:14,530 --> 04:06:14,970
Like...

6971
04:06:14,970 --> 04:06:16,030
Yeah, honestly.

6972
04:06:17,230 --> 04:06:18,230
Like, you felt...

6973
04:06:18,230 --> 04:06:18,570
It just hit now.

6974
04:06:18,850 --> 04:06:23,850
Yeah, it hit, like, after the 40-minute break was up.

6975
04:06:25,690 --> 04:06:29,310
This 40-minute break actually screwed us all up.

6976
04:06:31,950 --> 04:06:33,470
Petal doesn't know how to portal.

6977
04:06:34,130 --> 04:06:35,430
I can't... We can't hear shit.

6978
04:06:36,270 --> 04:06:38,190
Fucking... I'm getting nauseous.

6979
04:06:38,590 --> 04:06:40,370
Will you be able to play the other tournament after?

6980
04:06:41,210 --> 04:06:42,830
I might have to tell him I can't.

6981
04:06:42,830 --> 04:06:47,070
Yeah, I think you might have to ask for a ringer because you're saying that you're feeling sick right now.

6982
04:06:47,230 --> 04:06:50,050
I have to go tell him.

6983
04:06:51,590 --> 04:06:53,970
Oh my god, they have winners finalists too.

6984
04:06:54,050 --> 04:06:54,970
That's so fucked.

6985
04:07:01,100 --> 04:07:02,340
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

6986
04:07:10,720 --> 04:07:16,080
If we win this, it'll be a fucking miracle if we win past this set.

6987
04:07:18,580 --> 04:07:20,240
I mean...

6988
04:07:20,900 --> 04:07:22,800
Everything is against us.

6989
04:07:22,900 --> 04:07:26,960
I think it'd be an actual miracle if we get past this.

6990
04:07:32,110 --> 04:07:33,070
Showhole.

6991
04:07:34,530 --> 04:07:36,390
I mean...

6992
04:07:36,930 --> 04:07:38,090
Everybody's getting sick.

6993
04:07:39,030 --> 04:07:41,650
Everyone... Everything is not working.

6994
04:07:42,630 --> 04:07:43,790
I'm looking at Twitter, sorry.

6995
04:07:45,550 --> 04:07:49,390
Oh my god, I'll be so happy if we do get past this.

6996
04:07:49,670 --> 04:07:50,310
Disregard that, please.

6997
04:07:52,030 --> 04:07:53,350
Wait, what did you say?

6998
04:07:57,090 --> 04:07:58,290
I'm not saying it.

6999
04:08:00,730 --> 04:08:02,430
I'm not saying it again either.

7000
04:08:04,830 --> 04:08:08,050
I was like... I like how they added us like, are you guys okay?

7001
04:08:08,250 --> 04:08:09,790
But we just started.

7002
04:08:10,290 --> 04:08:10,870
Yeah, I was like, what?

7003
04:08:11,070 --> 04:08:12,210
We said we were alright.

7004
04:08:16,750 --> 04:08:18,590
I shine in darkness.

7005
04:08:21,070 --> 04:08:24,570
Alright, let's just do really well and win for Gomez.

7006
04:08:24,630 --> 04:08:25,570
Yes, for Gomez!

7007
04:08:27,190 --> 04:08:29,030
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

7008
04:08:29,950 --> 04:08:31,890
Okay, there's the magman.

7009
04:08:32,250 --> 04:08:34,230
Okay, Bucky, we're running 3-3.

7010
04:08:36,750 --> 04:08:38,490
I would like to save thing.

7011
04:08:38,750 --> 04:08:39,630
Yeah, oh yeah, save thing.

7012
04:08:39,710 --> 04:08:40,450
No, we're running 3-3.

7013
04:08:40,610 --> 04:08:42,450
Whenever they ban Matt...

7014
04:08:42,450 --> 04:08:44,320
Ban Bucky, save thing.

7015
04:08:44,320 --> 04:08:46,600
What if they ban out my strange?

7016
04:08:49,700 --> 04:08:51,020
We'll figure this out later.

7017
04:08:51,160 --> 04:08:52,060
We'll just save thing.

7018
04:08:52,320 --> 04:08:53,340
Thing is more important though.

7019
04:09:02,860 --> 04:09:04,420
Why is this happening now?

7020
04:09:05,540 --> 04:09:06,580
And then we ban Sue.

7021
04:09:07,540 --> 04:09:08,680
Wait, can't you play Groot?

7022
04:09:08,800 --> 04:09:09,720
Wait, they save Starlord.

7023
04:09:09,780 --> 04:09:10,420
They save Starlord.

7024
04:09:10,520 --> 04:09:11,760
Oh yeah, they have a Starlord player too.

7025
04:09:12,120 --> 04:09:14,160
And then ban Sue.

7026
04:09:14,160 --> 04:09:14,680
Ban Sue.

7027
04:09:17,920 --> 04:09:18,320
Loki.

7028
04:09:19,720 --> 04:09:21,900
Wait, we can still run 3-3.

7029
04:09:22,360 --> 04:09:24,780
Wait, I can name more Luna, right?

7030
04:09:24,860 --> 04:09:25,620
We could name more Luna.

7031
04:09:26,000 --> 04:09:27,100
Do we want to try that?

7032
04:09:27,200 --> 04:09:28,080
Can we ban Sue then?

7033
04:09:30,920 --> 04:09:31,900
Are you sure?

7034
04:09:32,160 --> 04:09:32,300
Okay.

7035
04:09:33,980 --> 04:09:34,520
Yeah, ban Sue.

7036
04:09:35,320 --> 04:09:36,200
We want Luna, Adam.

7037
04:09:37,220 --> 04:09:37,840
Luna, Adam?

7038
04:09:37,980 --> 04:09:38,120
Okay.

7039
04:09:38,120 --> 04:09:38,240
Yeah.

7040
04:09:40,500 --> 04:09:42,380
I'll put that Snowflake on...

7041
04:09:43,320 --> 04:09:44,200
On Gomez.

7042
04:09:45,520 --> 04:09:46,400
And then...

7043
04:09:46,400 --> 04:09:48,120
Yeah, we have...

7044
04:09:48,120 --> 04:09:49,540
We have name where...

7045
04:09:49,540 --> 04:09:51,840
Also, they don't know about Battle's training arc.

7046
04:09:52,280 --> 04:09:52,960
Yeah, they don't know.

7047
04:09:53,020 --> 04:09:54,960
They don't know the training weights.

7048
04:09:55,680 --> 04:09:56,060
Oh my god.

7049
04:09:58,240 --> 04:10:00,880
They're like, haha, we ban Magneto, he's got nothing now.

7050
04:10:01,200 --> 04:10:03,300
Oh god, that was a bad... Oh god, that felt so bad.

7051
04:10:03,740 --> 04:10:04,560
Oh, good.

7052
04:10:04,780 --> 04:10:05,860
Gomez, no!

7053
04:10:05,860 --> 04:10:06,380
What are you doing up there?

7054
04:10:06,460 --> 04:10:07,640
No, don't die!

7055
04:10:07,640 --> 04:10:08,780
Oh, that felt so bad.

7056
04:10:09,300 --> 04:10:11,320
Gomez, get like a puke-a-bowl or something.

7057
04:10:11,400 --> 04:10:12,520
Yeah, get like a trash can.

7058
04:10:12,620 --> 04:10:13,020
I don't know what that is.

7059
04:10:13,240 --> 04:10:16,040
Like a bowl that you can puke into without having to...

7060
04:10:16,040 --> 04:10:19,640
You think we could grab a sub outside of...

7061
04:10:20,920 --> 04:10:22,360
Like, get a DPS sub?

7062
04:10:22,480 --> 04:10:23,900
Because we might be able to get Ryan, right?

7063
04:10:24,300 --> 04:10:24,880
He's away.

7064
04:10:25,040 --> 04:10:26,180
Here we come once the set starts.

7065
04:10:26,680 --> 04:10:28,620
Yeah, but our DPS...

7066
04:10:28,620 --> 04:10:31,280
Our guy is fucking sick as fuck.

7067
04:10:32,740 --> 04:10:33,280
Yeah, I bet.

7068
04:10:33,840 --> 04:10:36,240
Oh, you missed a lot while you were wrapped up in that...

7069
04:10:36,240 --> 04:10:38,060
I can stomach throw, I can.

7070
04:10:38,280 --> 04:10:38,860
I can do it.

7071
04:10:39,640 --> 04:10:42,140
I don't know, it doesn't sound like it right now.

7072
04:10:44,660 --> 04:10:45,120
I'll...

7073
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:45,740
I got it.

7074
04:10:46,360 --> 04:10:47,640
I got it, don't worry.

7075
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:51,060
We might be able to get Ryan then if Gomez is like...

7076
04:10:51,060 --> 04:10:54,600
Yeah, but he has a... The tournament he's playing in starts in 15 minutes.

7077
04:10:54,760 --> 04:10:55,620
In 15 minutes?

7078
04:10:55,680 --> 04:10:56,460
Are you fucking... Okay.

7079
04:10:57,280 --> 04:10:57,740
Alright.

7080
04:10:58,600 --> 04:10:58,700
Yeah.

7081
04:10:59,260 --> 04:10:59,880
I'm lucky.

7082
04:11:00,240 --> 04:11:00,320
I'm a storm.

7083
04:11:01,580 --> 04:11:02,540
I'm a storm.

7084
04:11:02,540 --> 04:11:06,380
I think they're running Starlord here too.

7085
04:11:07,340 --> 04:11:09,900
I'm gonna really try not to stay...

7086
04:11:09,900 --> 04:11:10,840
Goddamn Tracer.

7087
04:11:12,220 --> 04:11:14,660
I don't know why I'm in... Overwatch terms are coming.

7088
04:11:26,280 --> 04:11:26,720
Nice.

7089
04:11:27,160 --> 04:11:27,760
Tracer's dead.

7090
04:11:28,000 --> 04:11:28,800
Strange, strange, strange.

7091
04:11:30,800 --> 04:11:31,580
Looking a little strange.

7092
04:11:31,660 --> 04:11:32,700
Strange one, strange one!

7093
04:11:33,160 --> 04:11:34,060
I think he's getting healed though.

7094
04:11:34,440 --> 04:11:35,500
Coney, back up if you have to.

7095
04:11:36,280 --> 04:11:37,060
I'm back, I'm back.

7096
04:11:37,060 --> 04:11:37,680
Where?

7097
04:11:38,160 --> 04:11:39,080
Where is the person?

7098
04:11:39,720 --> 04:11:40,820
There was a health bar through there.

7099
04:11:40,900 --> 04:11:41,200
Oh, okay.

7100
04:11:43,700 --> 04:11:44,600
Oh, I hear him.

7101
04:11:44,800 --> 04:11:45,120
He's by me.

7102
04:11:45,840 --> 04:11:47,940
There's a Mantis and a Starlord walking together.

7103
04:11:48,640 --> 04:11:49,060
Watch it, Strange.

7104
04:11:49,860 --> 04:11:50,280
Got you.

7105
04:11:50,480 --> 04:11:51,580
On my side, left side, left side.

7106
04:11:54,540 --> 04:11:55,780
They're trying to cheese.

7107
04:11:55,840 --> 04:11:57,880
They're trying to cheese with fucking Rigby.

7108
04:11:59,000 --> 04:11:59,220
Oh.

7109
04:12:01,000 --> 04:12:02,060
Let's kill this Mantis.

7110
04:12:05,990 --> 04:12:06,570
Got one.

7111
04:12:06,670 --> 04:12:06,950
Nice.

7112
04:12:07,590 --> 04:12:10,010
I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing.

7113
04:12:11,630 --> 04:12:11,990
Nice.

7114
04:12:13,790 --> 04:12:18,130
We can walk out with Luna right after.

7115
04:12:18,510 --> 04:12:18,670
Yep.

7116
04:12:20,190 --> 04:12:23,010
Sorry, I had to.

7117
04:12:23,870 --> 04:12:24,410
Look down.

7118
04:12:24,850 --> 04:12:25,130
Nice.

7119
04:12:26,410 --> 04:12:27,330
Let's cook it, let's cook it.

7120
04:12:27,390 --> 04:12:28,650
Yeah, no mobs, no mobs, no mobs.

7121
04:12:29,270 --> 04:12:30,390
I love Coney, I love Coney, I love Coney.

7122
04:12:30,550 --> 04:12:32,490
Okay, they have Starlord ult.

7123
04:12:32,850 --> 04:12:35,470
Lime, you might have to get ready to...

7124
04:12:35,470 --> 04:12:35,870
I can hide.

7125
04:12:35,870 --> 04:12:36,590
Hide, yeah.

7126
04:12:36,930 --> 04:12:38,750
They're gonna have Starlord ult here and they have Storm ult.

7127
04:12:39,730 --> 04:12:40,290
Good shit.

7128
04:12:40,530 --> 04:12:43,050
You might save Storm ult for Lime's rez.

7129
04:12:46,030 --> 04:12:47,150
Did you throw up?

7130
04:12:48,810 --> 04:12:49,850
No, I'm good, I'm good.

7131
04:12:51,990 --> 04:12:53,370
You absolutely ate that egg.

7132
04:12:54,850 --> 04:12:56,410
Portal, portal, portal, portal, portal, portal.

7133
04:12:57,310 --> 04:12:58,230
I'm good, I'm good.

7134
04:12:59,290 --> 04:13:00,050
Where are they?

7135
04:13:00,510 --> 04:13:01,670
Over here, they're right behind.

7136
04:13:01,730 --> 04:13:03,230
They're gonna Starlord ult anyway, okay?

7137
04:13:03,890 --> 04:13:05,370
Oh no, we don't have an answer for that.

7138
04:13:05,370 --> 04:13:06,470
I got Link, I got Link.

7139
04:13:10,680 --> 04:13:11,480
Oh my god, that's weird.

7140
04:13:12,280 --> 04:13:13,600
They've used a lot, I'm gonna go hide.

7141
04:13:13,660 --> 04:13:15,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go find a rez, go find a rez spot.

7142
04:13:20,920 --> 04:13:22,400
They're looking, they might look for him.

7143
04:13:22,480 --> 04:13:23,500
They are looking, they are looking.

7144
04:13:23,760 --> 04:13:25,920
We might TP, oh wait, okay, I'm coming over.

7145
04:13:26,680 --> 04:13:30,000
I didn't get the rez, but just keep everybody up as much as you can.

7146
04:13:32,640 --> 04:13:34,780
Point, point, point, point, point, point, point.

7147
04:13:34,800 --> 04:13:35,960
I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching.

7148
04:13:35,960 --> 04:13:36,220
I'm on.

7149
04:13:36,760 --> 04:13:37,560
I'm on it too.

7150
04:13:37,960 --> 04:13:38,340
I died.

7151
04:13:38,940 --> 04:13:40,480
That's fine, I have to die here too.

7152
04:13:41,320 --> 04:13:41,640
Tried.

7153
04:13:42,800 --> 04:13:45,240
You can, you can, what should we call it?

7154
04:13:45,820 --> 04:13:48,300
We can get off the Atom just against that, because they're triple support.

7155
04:13:48,400 --> 04:13:49,960
Okay, go Cloak.

7156
04:13:51,700 --> 04:13:52,780
Or Suit, did we ban Suit?

7157
04:13:52,860 --> 04:13:53,840
Yeah, we ban Suit, we ban Suit.

7158
04:13:54,220 --> 04:13:56,880
We ban Suit so Beto can have, can have free...

7159
04:13:56,880 --> 04:13:58,160
Or Mantis, oh no, you can Mantis, you can Mantis.

7160
04:13:58,640 --> 04:13:59,300
Okay, okay, okay.

7161
04:14:05,550 --> 04:14:07,150
Just damage boost Gomez when you can.

7162
04:14:07,730 --> 04:14:08,210
Yep.

7163
04:14:09,410 --> 04:14:10,230
You have Snowflake, Gomez.

7164
04:14:13,350 --> 04:14:14,370
Push up if you can.

7165
04:14:14,850 --> 04:14:15,610
Thanks, push up.

7166
04:14:15,870 --> 04:14:17,290
Yeah, I'm trying.

7167
04:14:18,970 --> 04:14:20,070
I'm slept, I'm slept.

7168
04:14:20,430 --> 04:14:21,190
Nice, nice.

7169
04:14:24,370 --> 04:14:24,990
I'm on.

7170
04:14:25,350 --> 04:14:25,750
Storm's dead.

7171
04:14:28,190 --> 04:14:28,570
You ready?

7172
04:14:29,790 --> 04:14:33,310
Just make sure you damage boost Gomez on cooldown whenever he doesn't have it.

7173
04:14:33,310 --> 04:14:34,070
I'm doing it, yeah.

7174
04:14:34,070 --> 04:14:35,550
Yeah, he's got it.

7175
04:14:36,650 --> 04:14:38,550
I wanted more than that, take the one.

7176
04:14:39,190 --> 04:14:40,170
Yeah, they have to reset now.

7177
04:14:40,930 --> 04:14:42,550
Yeah, they have to reset, just go back to heart.

7178
04:14:46,290 --> 04:14:46,650
Alright.

7179
04:14:54,610 --> 04:14:55,450
I'll try and save.

7180
04:14:55,830 --> 04:14:57,130
I'm saving my ult mostly.

7181
04:14:57,390 --> 04:14:58,970
Okay, you might Mantis ult this if you have...

7182
04:14:58,970 --> 04:14:59,770
Oh wait, you don't have it, okay.

7183
04:14:59,810 --> 04:15:00,390
I don't have it.

7184
04:15:00,610 --> 04:15:02,570
Okay, they're gonna Strange Ult then after this.

7185
04:15:04,770 --> 04:15:05,710
They have Strange Ult.

7186
04:15:06,310 --> 04:15:06,910
I am ulting.

7187
04:15:08,730 --> 04:15:09,430
I'm boosted.

7188
04:15:10,730 --> 04:15:12,270
3, 2, 1.

7189
04:15:12,990 --> 04:15:13,610
Backing up.

7190
04:15:13,770 --> 04:15:14,070
Backing up.

7191
04:15:20,680 --> 04:15:21,800
I need heals.

7192
04:15:22,140 --> 04:15:25,700
Oh, we don't get dropped.

7193
04:15:25,920 --> 04:15:28,220
We have portal, just die Gomez, yeah.

7194
04:15:28,660 --> 04:15:29,600
Starlord's healing here.

7195
04:15:30,260 --> 04:15:31,620
Just die, die, die, we need to die.

7196
04:15:31,860 --> 04:15:32,240
Okay, nice.

7197
04:15:34,260 --> 04:15:37,620
I'm gonna TP behind the boxes on the point or...

7198
04:15:37,620 --> 04:15:37,720
Yeah.

7199
04:15:39,920 --> 04:15:42,100
They might Strange Ult the portal, so careful.

7200
04:15:43,320 --> 04:15:44,760
They have no support ult, they have no support.

7201
04:15:44,860 --> 04:15:45,440
We have Mantis ult.

7202
04:15:47,620 --> 04:15:48,500
Do we need Loki here?

7203
04:15:48,780 --> 04:15:49,500
They're eyeing, they're eyeing.

7204
04:15:50,320 --> 04:15:51,220
Loki's bad, Loki's bad.

7205
04:15:51,260 --> 04:15:52,420
He's on top, he's on top, he's on top.

7206
04:15:52,640 --> 04:15:52,920
Watch out.

7207
04:15:53,540 --> 04:15:54,380
We got it, we got it.

7208
04:15:54,440 --> 04:15:54,720
It's fine.

7209
04:16:03,070 --> 04:16:04,310
Okay, can we walk in with Luna?

7210
04:16:04,830 --> 04:16:06,050
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis ult, Mantis ult.

7211
04:16:06,990 --> 04:16:08,590
I got ult after this Cloaking Dagger.

7212
04:16:11,610 --> 04:16:12,570
Storm on, Storm on.

7213
04:16:12,650 --> 04:16:13,050
Storm's dead.

7214
04:16:13,210 --> 04:16:14,010
Okay, I'm ulting after that.

7215
04:16:15,710 --> 04:16:16,790
Nice, nice, nice, just wait.

7216
04:16:17,350 --> 04:16:19,170
Save your ult, save your ult, save your ult, save your ult.

7217
04:16:20,410 --> 04:16:20,990
I'm a hero.

7218
04:16:21,610 --> 04:16:22,830
I just had a good lineup.

7219
04:16:25,270 --> 04:16:25,890
I can chase him.

7220
04:16:28,210 --> 04:16:30,910
Gomez, peek me so I can give you Snowflake.

7221
04:16:32,150 --> 04:16:35,410
Okay, I think this is working pretty well.

7222
04:16:35,610 --> 04:16:37,330
I am also...

7223
04:16:37,690 --> 04:16:38,470
Do you think...

7224
04:16:38,830 --> 04:16:41,730
Do you think we match their trip support too or no?

7225
04:16:43,230 --> 04:16:43,950
We don't have Loki.

7226
04:16:44,890 --> 04:16:45,790
If you can go Cloak...

7227
04:16:45,790 --> 04:16:47,870
I mean, I see Cloaking Dagger.

7228
04:16:47,870 --> 04:16:49,170
Yeah, yeah, just do Cloaking, yeah.

7229
04:16:50,010 --> 04:16:52,110
We can do Cloaking on attack and see how it goes.

7230
04:16:52,350 --> 04:16:53,070
Oh, they know, they know.

7231
04:16:53,230 --> 04:16:54,610
Yeah, let's try it on attack, we'll try it on attack.

7232
04:16:56,050 --> 04:16:56,670
I got nothing.

7233
04:16:57,090 --> 04:16:57,990
I have it, I have it, I have one.

7234
04:16:59,650 --> 04:17:00,370
I have ult, I have ult.

7235
04:17:03,410 --> 04:17:06,350
Three, oh, eight, seven, six, five...

7236
04:17:06,350 --> 04:17:07,030
I'm whaling inside.

7237
04:17:07,830 --> 04:17:08,150
Four...

7238
04:17:09,430 --> 04:17:09,730
Three...

7239
04:17:10,890 --> 04:17:11,190
Two...

7240
04:17:11,190 --> 04:17:11,630
One.

7241
04:17:13,790 --> 04:17:14,510
You still got this?

7242
04:17:15,370 --> 04:17:17,530
I still have ult, I'm holding it, just one second.

7243
04:17:20,490 --> 04:17:21,270
He's left, strange.

7244
04:17:21,970 --> 04:17:22,370
He's sleep.

7245
04:17:23,190 --> 04:17:23,730
I'm ulting.

7246
04:17:28,290 --> 04:17:29,430
I got the freeze, I got the freeze!

7247
04:17:29,510 --> 04:17:30,830
Nice, good freeze, good freeze, good freeze.

7248
04:17:30,950 --> 04:17:32,190
Freeze, good freeze, good shit.

7249
04:17:33,690 --> 04:17:34,690
Keep them off, keep them off.

7250
04:17:34,750 --> 04:17:35,330
They're gonna go up top.

7251
04:17:35,550 --> 04:17:36,070
I'm looking, I'm looking.

7252
04:17:36,170 --> 04:17:36,650
I got you, I got you.

7253
04:17:36,650 --> 04:17:37,270
Okay, I'm looking at him.

7254
04:17:38,090 --> 04:17:38,450
Nice.

7255
04:17:38,570 --> 04:17:38,650
Good shit.

7256
04:17:38,850 --> 04:17:39,150
Nice!

7257
04:17:39,430 --> 04:17:39,610
Yeah!

7258
04:17:41,110 --> 04:17:41,670
Good shit.

7259
04:17:43,490 --> 04:17:45,110
Oh my god, that was scary.

7260
04:17:45,750 --> 04:17:46,070
Woo!

7261
04:17:47,230 --> 04:17:48,770
I don't like not having Sue for that.

7262
04:17:49,870 --> 04:17:52,790
Yeah, but they don't have a Sue, they can't put, they can't cancel our ult.

7263
04:17:52,790 --> 04:17:53,310
Yeah, that's nice.

7264
04:17:53,470 --> 04:17:56,070
They have a nasty Sue as well, so it's just like...

7265
04:17:56,070 --> 04:17:56,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7266
04:17:58,450 --> 04:18:00,130
Okay, we'll run trip support here.

7267
04:18:00,570 --> 04:18:00,790
Okay.

7268
04:18:00,890 --> 04:18:02,490
With Cloak, and see how it goes.

7269
04:18:04,070 --> 04:18:06,950
The only thing I'm worried about is like you guys not getting your ults fast enough.

7270
04:18:07,790 --> 04:18:08,390
It'll be fine.

7271
04:18:08,490 --> 04:18:09,610
We can...

7272
04:18:09,610 --> 04:18:10,570
It'll be fine.

7273
04:18:10,870 --> 04:18:12,590
What do we care about more?

7274
04:18:12,710 --> 04:18:14,930
Getting our support defensive ults out fast enough?

7275
04:18:14,990 --> 04:18:17,230
Or more heals to stay healthy throughout the fight?

7276
04:18:17,710 --> 04:18:21,030
I think like, we can win the Brawl fight if we have more heals.

7277
04:18:21,670 --> 04:18:22,030
I think.

7278
04:18:22,170 --> 04:18:22,350
Okay.

7279
04:18:22,590 --> 04:18:24,650
I think we have the stronger frontline.

7280
04:18:25,550 --> 04:18:26,730
Yeah, we TP, we TP in.

7281
04:18:26,950 --> 04:18:27,150
Okay.

7282
04:18:27,490 --> 04:18:28,390
Yeah, you guys all go up top.

7283
04:18:30,330 --> 04:18:31,450
They're gonna expect that.

7284
04:18:31,750 --> 04:18:32,390
So we can do...

7285
04:18:33,890 --> 04:18:34,930
Up top is better.

7286
04:18:35,310 --> 04:18:36,490
Yeah, high ground is always better.

7287
04:18:36,610 --> 04:18:37,850
Just bully them off of high ground.

7288
04:18:39,130 --> 04:18:43,750
If it doesn't work, if the triple support doesn't work, you just swap to a Namor.

7289
04:18:45,530 --> 04:18:47,330
And we feel like it's like a...

7290
04:18:47,330 --> 04:18:48,310
Yeah, if we don't have enough damage.

7291
04:18:48,430 --> 04:18:49,750
If we're not killing stuff, then yeah.

7292
04:18:53,870 --> 04:18:54,330
Skooma's alive.

7293
04:18:54,390 --> 04:18:54,990
Skooma, is he doing okay?

7294
04:18:55,210 --> 04:18:56,170
Yeah, I was gonna say, is he alive?

7295
04:18:56,390 --> 04:18:56,830
Yeah, he's fine.

7296
04:18:56,950 --> 04:18:58,130
I think he just doesn't need...

7297
04:18:58,130 --> 04:18:59,190
He's meditating.

7298
04:18:59,190 --> 04:19:00,910
Just let him chill, let him chill, let him chill.

7299
04:19:01,210 --> 04:19:01,410
Yeah.

7300
04:19:03,190 --> 04:19:04,990
When you stop moving, I'm like, is he dead?

7301
04:19:06,210 --> 04:19:07,910
No, I'm not vomiting yet, no.

7302
04:19:08,330 --> 04:19:08,990
Dead of pigs.

7303
04:19:09,510 --> 04:19:10,130
We're TPing.

7304
04:19:10,210 --> 04:19:11,910
I don't think I will vomit.

7305
04:19:12,190 --> 04:19:12,910
I don't think I will.

7306
04:19:13,730 --> 04:19:14,770
Alright, let's go on high ground.

7307
04:19:15,030 --> 04:19:16,090
Oh, there's Penny stuff.

7308
04:19:17,270 --> 04:19:18,090
There's Penny stuff?

7309
04:19:18,290 --> 04:19:19,190
I don't...

7310
04:19:22,730 --> 04:19:23,130
Okay.

7311
04:19:24,190 --> 04:19:24,570
They're mine.

7312
04:19:27,370 --> 04:19:28,290
No spider enough.

7313
04:19:28,470 --> 04:19:28,930
We can walk.

7314
04:19:30,030 --> 04:19:31,100
We got Penny underneath.

7315
04:19:32,350 --> 04:19:33,250
Tell me when to drop.

7316
04:19:40,320 --> 04:19:40,740
Drop.

7317
04:19:41,260 --> 04:19:41,680
Drop?

7318
04:19:41,880 --> 04:19:42,140
Got it.

7319
04:19:42,580 --> 04:19:43,220
Yep, got it, yep.

7320
04:19:45,500 --> 04:19:46,160
Storm low.

7321
04:19:46,260 --> 04:19:47,000
Storm, Storm one.

7322
04:19:47,160 --> 04:19:48,140
Storm got her ass.

7323
04:19:49,320 --> 04:19:50,360
I'm going on their backline.

7324
04:19:52,220 --> 04:19:56,400
I'm dropping too.

7325
04:19:57,180 --> 04:19:58,300
Luna one, Luna one, Luna one.

7326
04:19:58,620 --> 04:19:58,800
Okay.

7327
04:20:00,200 --> 04:20:01,480
Penny low, Penny low, Penny low.

7328
04:20:01,580 --> 04:20:02,840
Penny's low, Penny low, Penny low.

7329
04:20:03,060 --> 04:20:03,280
Yeah, yeah.

7330
04:20:03,520 --> 04:20:04,580
Strange, strange, strange, strange, strange.

7331
04:20:06,640 --> 04:20:07,840
Strange, strange, looking strange.

7332
04:20:08,100 --> 04:20:08,780
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

7333
04:20:08,800 --> 04:20:09,540
Yeah, yeah, Smurlur got away.

7334
04:20:09,620 --> 04:20:09,780
It's fine.

7335
04:20:09,840 --> 04:20:10,320
Smurlur here.

7336
04:20:11,120 --> 04:20:11,840
That's fine, that's fine.

7337
04:20:12,140 --> 04:20:13,060
He's zoned, he's zoned.

7338
04:20:13,160 --> 04:20:13,460
It's fine.

7339
04:20:13,860 --> 04:20:14,360
Good shit.

7340
04:20:14,720 --> 04:20:15,120
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

7341
04:20:15,340 --> 04:20:16,080
Yeah, good capture.

7342
04:20:16,840 --> 04:20:17,040
Good job.

7343
04:20:17,800 --> 04:20:18,240
Are you okay?

7344
04:20:18,440 --> 04:20:19,500
Oh, Gomez.

7345
04:20:20,200 --> 04:20:22,480
No, no, I wasn't good.

7346
04:20:22,600 --> 04:20:23,360
No, I wasn't good.

7347
04:20:23,760 --> 04:20:24,120
Gomez.

7348
04:20:24,240 --> 04:20:25,560
He like stood still for a second.

7349
04:20:25,660 --> 04:20:26,160
I saw that.

7350
04:20:27,520 --> 04:20:28,700
Is he still behind us?

7351
04:20:29,080 --> 04:20:30,060
He's still here, yeah.

7352
04:20:30,160 --> 04:20:32,180
I'm like focusing on Brigitte.

7353
04:20:32,960 --> 04:20:33,200
Okay.

7354
04:20:33,980 --> 04:20:34,880
I'm good though.

7355
04:20:35,180 --> 04:20:35,840
Oh, hey, I see him.

7356
04:20:36,240 --> 04:20:37,100
He's still behind us, yeah.

7357
04:20:37,560 --> 04:20:38,480
He's still behind us, yeah.

7358
04:20:41,980 --> 04:20:42,880
I froze Punisher.

7359
04:20:44,640 --> 04:20:45,820
But you can't do anything for now.

7360
04:20:47,580 --> 04:20:48,300
We used...

7361
04:20:48,300 --> 04:20:49,420
I can ult, I can ult him.

7362
04:20:50,060 --> 04:20:50,480
Have you...

7363
04:20:50,480 --> 04:20:51,220
Yeah, I'm going, I'm going.

7364
04:20:51,240 --> 04:20:52,380
Use it to aggress, use it to aggress.

7365
04:20:52,620 --> 04:20:53,640
Get the counter off of it.

7366
04:20:55,920 --> 04:20:56,560
They have Pun now.

7367
04:20:58,700 --> 04:20:59,380
I'm on their Luna.

7368
04:20:59,700 --> 04:21:00,440
I'm just gonna try to kill her.

7369
04:21:02,700 --> 04:21:03,700
Luna's dead, Luna's dead.

7370
04:21:04,700 --> 04:21:05,340
I'm going back.

7371
04:21:05,520 --> 04:21:06,500
Pun dead, Pun dead.

7372
04:21:07,100 --> 04:21:08,800
Okay, I died.

7373
04:21:09,980 --> 04:21:11,240
I got all my ulti.

7374
04:21:14,340 --> 04:21:14,740
Nice.

7375
04:21:15,840 --> 04:21:16,800
I'm damage boosting for you.

7376
04:21:17,240 --> 04:21:18,040
Good shit!

7377
04:21:19,320 --> 04:21:19,680
Nice, nice.

7378
04:21:19,720 --> 04:21:20,200
Just push Grag.

7379
04:21:20,360 --> 04:21:21,200
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

7380
04:21:21,680 --> 04:21:23,060
We have Manta's ult for...

7381
04:21:23,060 --> 04:21:23,340
Okay.

7382
04:21:24,340 --> 04:21:25,680
Do not get Manta's ult.

7383
04:21:26,360 --> 04:21:27,600
Do not get Manta's ult.

7384
04:21:27,600 --> 04:21:29,040
Just play further away from us.

7385
04:21:29,440 --> 04:21:30,540
Do not get Strange ulted.

7386
04:21:30,620 --> 04:21:31,240
Do not get Strange ulted.

7387
04:21:31,440 --> 04:21:33,560
3 on point, 3 on point, 3 on point.

7388
04:21:33,800 --> 04:21:34,560
Yeah, 3, 3, 3, 3.

7389
04:21:35,680 --> 04:21:36,240
Get, get.

7390
04:21:38,040 --> 04:21:38,280
Okay.

7391
04:21:40,080 --> 04:21:40,600
Yeah, yeah.

7392
04:21:40,620 --> 04:21:41,360
Use it, use it, use it.

7393
04:21:42,100 --> 04:21:42,820
You should live through it.

7394
04:21:43,080 --> 04:21:43,980
Yeah, you live through it.

7395
04:21:45,080 --> 04:21:46,080
Oh my god.

7396
04:21:49,740 --> 04:21:51,120
Strange low, Strange low, Strange low.

7397
04:21:53,420 --> 04:21:54,220
Nice, good ult, good ult.

7398
04:21:54,620 --> 04:21:54,920
Nice.

7399
04:21:55,880 --> 04:21:56,560
I got him.

7400
04:21:58,040 --> 04:21:58,780
How do you reload?

7401
04:22:00,340 --> 04:22:01,680
Use ult when you have it.

7402
04:22:01,720 --> 04:22:02,420
Keep walking to heals, bottle.

7403
04:22:02,560 --> 04:22:03,100
Keep walking to heals.

7404
04:22:04,440 --> 04:22:05,620
Oh, I forgot you can do that.

7405
04:22:06,740 --> 04:22:07,200
Oh, nice.

7406
04:22:07,200 --> 04:22:08,060
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna.

7407
04:22:08,460 --> 04:22:08,760
Nice.

7408
04:22:09,160 --> 04:22:09,340
Woo!

7409
04:22:10,640 --> 04:22:11,000
Nice.

7410
04:22:11,380 --> 04:22:12,120
Oh, good job, guys.

7411
04:22:12,580 --> 04:22:12,740
Woo!

7412
04:22:12,980 --> 04:22:13,280
Alright.

7413
04:22:14,100 --> 04:22:14,820
Good shit!

7414
04:22:16,800 --> 04:22:18,340
That was tough for me, I'm not gonna lie.

7415
04:22:20,520 --> 04:22:24,080
Our entire team is just dying one by one.

7416
04:22:24,200 --> 04:22:24,600
That was like...

7417
04:22:25,360 --> 04:22:26,120
I feel like that was better.

7418
04:22:26,440 --> 04:22:26,700
Yeah.

7419
04:22:26,700 --> 04:22:28,220
That felt very good.

7420
04:22:28,480 --> 04:22:31,140
Yeah, imagine if Gomez was at 100%.

7421
04:22:35,850 --> 04:22:36,770
He's doing alright.

7422
04:22:36,970 --> 04:22:38,690
He's doing his best surviving.

7423
04:22:40,590 --> 04:22:43,270
I'm just gonna...

7424
04:22:43,270 --> 04:22:44,290
Just breathe.

7425
04:22:44,490 --> 04:22:46,230
That strange denial on the ult was great.

7426
04:22:46,350 --> 04:22:46,450
Yeah.

7427
04:22:46,450 --> 04:22:47,570
He was like, I got them all!

7428
04:22:47,770 --> 04:22:47,970
No.

7429
04:22:49,170 --> 04:22:50,090
It's like, surprise!

7430
04:22:55,870 --> 04:23:01,170
All I can think about is that if we win this next one and we have a break, you should try and see if you can throw up.

7431
04:23:01,170 --> 04:23:01,770
We have time.

7432
04:23:02,050 --> 04:23:02,310
Yeah.

7433
04:23:02,650 --> 04:23:07,170
If you throw up, you might be able to get the thing that's causing you nauseous out of your system.

7434
04:23:07,210 --> 04:23:08,230
See, that's the thing.

7435
04:23:08,970 --> 04:23:10,790
That I have a fear of vomiting.

7436
04:23:11,110 --> 04:23:13,750
So I was just like, that is impossible for me.

7437
04:23:14,090 --> 04:23:14,590
Gotcha, yeah.

7438
04:23:15,710 --> 04:23:17,170
Like, I legit have a phobia.

7439
04:23:18,790 --> 04:23:20,050
I see this a lot.

7440
04:23:21,070 --> 04:23:26,910
When I went to a trip over to Seattle, I got really sick from some food and I came back.

7441
04:23:26,910 --> 04:23:32,990
I had food poisoning for 12 days or around 2 weeks and I didn't throw up once because I refused to.

7442
04:23:35,810 --> 04:23:39,930
I just kept my stomach in the entire time.

7443
04:23:40,130 --> 04:23:41,650
Just got one more game, boss.

7444
04:23:41,870 --> 04:23:45,370
Yeah, just one more and then try and see if you can get something out.

7445
04:23:45,370 --> 04:23:47,110
Maybe you can try and shit, you know?

7446
04:23:47,250 --> 04:23:47,770
Yeah, that's true.

7447
04:23:47,830 --> 04:23:48,950
Just stay in the bathroom.

7448
04:23:49,250 --> 04:23:50,010
The other way, yeah.

7449
04:23:51,030 --> 04:23:55,290
When you stood still against Riggzy, you just gave up the 1v1.

7450
04:23:55,290 --> 04:23:57,870
Yeah, he was just still.

7451
04:23:58,090 --> 04:23:58,590
It was funny.

7452
04:23:59,950 --> 04:24:01,110
I was just feeling it.

7453
04:24:01,130 --> 04:24:01,990
I was like, no, I don't care.

7454
04:24:02,610 --> 04:24:03,790
You're like, I'm not trying.

7455
04:24:04,010 --> 04:24:05,470
I'm not 1v1ing you.

7456
04:24:07,730 --> 04:24:10,130
I'm going to reset my game since we're hitting a new thing anyway.

7457
04:24:10,670 --> 04:24:11,930
I'm going to hit the restroom.

7458
04:24:12,070 --> 04:24:12,370
I'll be right back.

7459
04:24:12,390 --> 04:24:12,930
Yeah, me too.

7460
04:24:13,130 --> 04:24:14,150
I'll take a bathroom break too.

7461
04:24:16,270 --> 04:24:17,650
I was going to invite everyone first.

7462
04:24:19,150 --> 04:24:21,010
I am here, so you can invite me.

7463
04:24:22,130 --> 04:24:23,430
Hey, look, my team is here.

7464
04:24:24,650 --> 04:24:25,270
Where's Coney?

7465
04:24:28,200 --> 04:24:29,380
I don't see Coney online.

7466
04:24:31,660 --> 04:24:32,200
He's muted.

7467
04:24:32,580 --> 04:24:33,440
Maybe he needs a second.

7468
04:24:34,600 --> 04:24:35,620
Oh, he restarted his game.

7469
04:24:36,140 --> 04:24:37,220
Oh, yeah, that was him.

7470
04:24:39,180 --> 04:24:40,080
Is Bettle okay?

7471
04:24:40,200 --> 04:24:40,700
He's deafened.

7472
04:24:40,760 --> 04:24:41,560
Oh, wait, did he go to the bathroom?

7473
04:24:43,480 --> 04:24:47,480
I'm looking up this history of why people say C9, because I have no idea.

7474
04:24:47,480 --> 04:24:59,440
Oh, so there's a team in Overwatch that played under the name Cloud9, and they kept forgetting about the point over and over and over, and it got to a point where everyone just kept typing C9.

7475
04:25:00,460 --> 04:25:05,280
So, the Cloud9, they forgot about point team.

7476
04:25:06,900 --> 04:25:09,320
I see Shur4 and Mendo in there.

7477
04:25:10,160 --> 04:25:13,220
Oh, yeah, if you say it in front of Shur4, he gets pissed.

7478
04:25:17,480 --> 04:25:18,520
He's the cause.

7479
04:25:19,720 --> 04:25:21,600
I only know C9's League team.

7480
04:25:30,810 --> 04:25:31,550
Oh, how about CS?

7481
04:25:33,090 --> 04:25:33,870
Not Overwatch.

7482
04:25:34,250 --> 04:25:35,110
Yeah, I was going to say.

7483
04:25:35,510 --> 04:25:36,430
It's been around for a long time.

7484
04:25:36,990 --> 04:25:37,810
Wrong game, wrong game.

7485
04:25:38,950 --> 04:25:43,470
Game, Gomez, just lock in for this game, and then you can reset yourself.

7486
04:25:43,730 --> 04:25:43,870
I will.

7487
04:25:50,010 --> 04:25:51,250
Alright, I'm back on.

7488
04:25:51,490 --> 04:25:52,070
Good adapting.

7489
04:25:53,410 --> 04:25:57,670
They tried to deny us 3-3, but they fucked up.

7490
04:26:03,700 --> 04:26:04,980
What the fuck?

7491
04:26:05,520 --> 04:26:06,840
Who's having a race right now?

7492
04:26:07,320 --> 04:26:08,360
Sorry, sorry, that was outside.

7493
04:26:13,430 --> 04:26:17,050
I live in the city now, so you're going to hear a lot of noises like that.

7494
04:26:19,390 --> 04:26:21,230
At least it's not police cars.

7495
04:26:21,890 --> 04:26:23,490
Do you have your window open and stuff?

7496
04:26:24,110 --> 04:26:25,310
No, not at all.

7497
04:26:25,310 --> 04:26:26,990
I'm just nearby, next to the balcony.

7498
04:26:29,030 --> 04:26:31,310
There's a big window next to me, which is pretty nice.

7499
04:26:32,410 --> 04:26:37,010
Good sunlight and all, but at the same time, it's a dull window.

7500
04:26:38,510 --> 04:26:41,550
Not the best soundproofing, so I hear a lot of shit outside.

7501
04:26:42,010 --> 04:26:42,550
A lot.

7502
04:26:45,650 --> 04:26:46,850
How are we looking, team?

7503
04:26:46,990 --> 04:26:48,850
Oh wait, they just sent that earlier, right?

7504
04:26:51,170 --> 04:26:52,730
Yeah, that was before the first game.

7505
04:26:52,730 --> 04:26:53,490
Are we all back?

7506
04:26:54,330 --> 04:26:55,130
No, I'm back.

7507
04:26:57,190 --> 04:26:57,990
I'm here.

7508
04:27:01,850 --> 04:27:02,250
Actually,

7509
04:27:08,070 --> 04:27:08,770
let me piss too.

7510
04:27:14,410 --> 04:27:16,150
Is this still 2 out of 3?

7511
04:27:16,250 --> 04:27:17,230
It's not 3 out of 5, right?

7512
04:27:18,650 --> 04:27:20,970
No, apparently it did happen in Overwatch.

7513
04:27:21,170 --> 04:27:23,370
It was not just CS, it happened in Overwatch too.

7514
04:27:25,050 --> 04:27:25,490
What?

7515
04:27:25,670 --> 04:27:26,190
What do you mean?

7516
04:27:26,430 --> 04:27:27,350
What are you guys talking about?

7517
04:27:28,410 --> 04:27:28,850
C9.

7518
04:27:28,930 --> 04:27:29,290
C9?

7519
04:27:29,350 --> 04:27:30,750
C9 originated in Overwatch.

7520
04:27:32,090 --> 04:27:33,870
I was there when it happened.

7521
04:27:34,390 --> 04:27:36,890
Well, I wasn't there, I was watching it live when it happened.

7522
04:27:37,950 --> 04:27:42,670
Yeah, it didn't happen in CS, it happened in Overwatch.

7523
04:27:42,790 --> 04:27:45,890
Were you spreading misinformation as an Overwatch player?

7524
04:27:46,730 --> 04:27:47,290
No, no.

7525
04:27:47,570 --> 04:27:49,290
Maimuu tried making me think it was CS.

7526
04:27:49,470 --> 04:27:51,750
No, you were spreading misinformation!

7527
04:27:51,750 --> 04:27:53,810
Sorry, someone in my chat, sorry.

7528
04:27:54,210 --> 04:27:56,310
Did you believe them?

7529
04:27:57,050 --> 04:27:57,690
I did.

7530
04:27:57,910 --> 04:27:59,230
I'm not supposed to believe chat, right?

7531
04:27:59,230 --> 04:28:00,850
He's in a vulnerable state right now.

7532
04:28:00,930 --> 04:28:02,190
Oh, that's so true!

7533
04:28:02,470 --> 04:28:03,710
That's so fucked up!

7534
04:28:03,890 --> 04:28:06,270
They're taking advantage of this poor man!

7535
04:28:06,630 --> 04:28:07,510
They can tell him anything.

7536
04:28:08,550 --> 04:28:10,310
He'll believe anything you say.

7537
04:28:10,550 --> 04:28:13,710
Oh my god, he's like, oh my god, he's vulnerable now.

7538
04:28:13,830 --> 04:28:14,710
Chat, get him.

7539
04:28:15,790 --> 04:28:16,550
Get me, get me.

7540
04:28:17,450 --> 04:28:19,270
Oh no, I'm cooked.

7541
04:28:21,490 --> 04:28:22,450
He's weak!

7542
04:28:25,430 --> 04:28:27,390
Whenever Shota's back, we'll be alright.

7543
04:28:28,430 --> 04:28:30,330
We'll also take some Alka-Seltzer after this.

7544
04:28:30,590 --> 04:28:32,570
Yeah, just take everything.

7545
04:28:34,330 --> 04:28:36,510
I think I need to take a painkiller afterwards.

7546
04:28:36,630 --> 04:28:37,550
We're all just falling apart.

7547
04:28:45,970 --> 04:28:47,650
It'll be fine, I believe.

7548
04:28:49,310 --> 04:28:51,210
Did you use Q-tips to clean your ears?

7549
04:28:51,210 --> 04:28:52,030
Gomez?

7550
04:28:53,230 --> 04:28:53,530
No.

7551
04:28:53,810 --> 04:28:54,390
Oh, okay.

7552
04:28:54,830 --> 04:28:56,510
Okay, what did you use to clean your ears?

7553
04:28:57,730 --> 04:29:01,630
I have a little syringe thing that lets you clear out your ears.

7554
04:29:01,750 --> 04:29:02,570
Oh, okay, okay.

7555
04:29:02,610 --> 04:29:03,930
I was gonna say a syringe?

7556
04:29:04,450 --> 04:29:07,270
No, I didn't use an actual syringe.

7557
04:29:07,410 --> 04:29:08,350
I have an ear cleaner.

7558
04:29:08,710 --> 04:29:10,590
Okay, okay, so it wasn't the Q-tips.

7559
04:29:10,850 --> 04:29:11,410
I'm ready!

7560
04:29:11,730 --> 04:29:12,570
Okay, let's R.

7561
04:29:13,110 --> 04:29:14,010
Ready, ready!

7562
04:29:14,030 --> 04:29:14,890
We R, R.

7563
04:29:16,630 --> 04:29:17,070
Okay.

7564
04:29:17,430 --> 04:29:18,110
Alright, let's get it.

7565
04:29:18,730 --> 04:29:20,530
Alright, come on, one game, one game.

7566
04:29:20,810 --> 04:29:22,070
Let's close it out here.

7567
04:29:22,490 --> 04:29:23,230
Go to Midtown.

7568
04:29:25,250 --> 04:29:25,770
Midtown.

7569
04:29:31,130 --> 04:29:33,370
Someone's like, you vaccinated your ear?

7570
04:29:39,490 --> 04:29:40,010
Okay.

7571
04:29:48,420 --> 04:29:49,860
Alright, same ban line.

7572
04:29:51,860 --> 04:29:53,460
Same ban and same line.

7573
04:29:54,360 --> 04:29:55,960
The Bucky main can't do too much.

7574
04:29:55,960 --> 04:29:58,940
Yeah, he doesn't know what to do when he can't play Bucky.

7575
04:30:00,200 --> 04:30:01,420
We love that for us.

7576
04:30:01,580 --> 04:30:01,800
Yeah.

7577
04:30:02,800 --> 04:30:04,000
Yay, one-tricks.

7578
04:30:04,380 --> 04:30:04,820
Yay!

7579
04:30:05,860 --> 04:30:08,180
Who would ever recruit a one-trick on your team?

7580
04:30:09,380 --> 04:30:10,160
That's stupid.

7581
04:30:10,320 --> 04:30:10,820
I know.

7582
04:30:13,500 --> 04:30:15,860
But if you teach the one-trick a trick, wait.

7583
04:30:16,240 --> 04:30:17,160
Nope, still that.

7584
04:30:17,180 --> 04:30:17,860
That's kinda nice.

7585
04:30:17,900 --> 04:30:19,160
They still don't want the mag.

7586
04:30:19,380 --> 04:30:19,600
Bucky.

7587
04:30:19,600 --> 04:30:20,140
That's crazy.

7588
04:30:22,180 --> 04:30:23,240
Gonna save things.

7589
04:30:23,280 --> 04:30:23,800
Fuck you outta here.

7590
04:30:28,070 --> 04:30:31,090
You know, I was kinda liking the Mantis.

7591
04:30:31,710 --> 04:30:32,890
Yeah, Mantis worked really well.

7592
04:30:33,310 --> 04:30:34,090
Mantis was good.

7593
04:30:34,270 --> 04:30:36,510
Yeah, if you get to play Starlord, then you play...

7594
04:30:36,510 --> 04:30:37,710
We play Mantis.

7595
04:30:38,670 --> 04:30:39,470
Oh, it protects.

7596
04:30:40,650 --> 04:30:42,190
They're gonna ban Starlord now.

7597
04:30:42,270 --> 04:30:43,030
Yes, Starlord kill.

7598
04:30:44,310 --> 04:30:45,370
Starlord's gone, guys.

7599
04:30:45,690 --> 04:30:45,970
It's over.

7600
04:30:46,010 --> 04:30:46,290
No!

7601
04:30:46,610 --> 04:30:48,250
Wait, that's fine.

7602
04:30:48,330 --> 04:30:48,650
That's fine.

7603
04:30:48,650 --> 04:30:49,150
I'll kill that.

7604
04:30:49,570 --> 04:30:50,570
What do we ban then?

7605
04:30:50,630 --> 04:30:51,650
Do we ban Cloak?

7606
04:30:51,970 --> 04:30:52,370
Wait.

7607
04:30:53,270 --> 04:30:55,110
Is this a triple tank spingle?

7608
04:30:55,210 --> 04:30:56,190
Yeah, we can run 3-3.

7609
04:30:56,950 --> 04:30:57,830
No, they ban mag.

7610
04:30:58,670 --> 04:30:59,790
We have strange.

7611
04:31:00,090 --> 04:31:01,690
We have strange thing that you can play.

7612
04:31:01,950 --> 04:31:02,590
Who are we banning?

7613
04:31:02,830 --> 04:31:03,650
Are we banning Cloak?

7614
04:31:04,490 --> 04:31:04,830
Or Hela?

7615
04:31:06,850 --> 04:31:07,610
Ban Cloak.

7616
04:31:07,870 --> 04:31:08,770
Cloak, Cloak, Cloak, Cloak.

7617
04:31:09,030 --> 04:31:09,130
Oh, ban Hela.

7618
04:31:09,270 --> 04:31:09,610
Oh, Hela?

7619
04:31:10,370 --> 04:31:11,130
Oh my god.

7620
04:31:11,150 --> 04:31:11,990
What do we ban?

7621
04:31:12,190 --> 04:31:12,770
You keep saying shit.

7622
04:31:13,110 --> 04:31:13,410
Ban what?

7623
04:31:13,470 --> 04:31:13,850
Ban what?

7624
04:31:14,430 --> 04:31:14,830
Oh, Hela?

7625
04:31:14,950 --> 04:31:15,110
Okay.

7626
04:31:15,570 --> 04:31:16,110
Hela's good.

7627
04:31:16,190 --> 04:31:16,590
Hela's good.

7628
04:31:26,530 --> 04:31:28,030
So who do you want me on for now?

7629
04:31:28,050 --> 04:31:28,290
Adam?

7630
04:31:28,290 --> 04:31:28,890
I guess...

7631
04:31:29,420 --> 04:31:31,110
I say no-no.

7632
04:31:32,450 --> 04:31:33,170
They're probably kidding.

7633
04:31:33,170 --> 04:31:34,010
No respect.

7634
04:31:35,130 --> 04:31:36,350
I assume it's a joke.

7635
04:31:36,490 --> 04:31:36,790
Okay.

7636
04:31:37,290 --> 04:31:38,110
I think it's a joke.

7637
04:31:38,110 --> 04:31:38,770
I mean, maybe not.

7638
04:31:39,590 --> 04:31:40,710
I hope it is.

7639
04:31:40,750 --> 04:31:41,470
Do you want me on Adam for now?

7640
04:31:41,470 --> 04:31:42,250
No, no, you on Sue.

7641
04:31:42,370 --> 04:31:42,790
You on Sue.

7642
04:31:43,770 --> 04:31:43,970
Sue?

7643
04:31:44,130 --> 04:31:44,330
Okay.

7644
04:31:45,990 --> 04:31:48,710
We need to know if you were serious or not.

7645
04:31:53,110 --> 04:31:55,110
I can also do the Mantis if we need.

7646
04:31:57,810 --> 04:31:59,570
I think we should be fine on healing now.

7647
04:32:00,390 --> 04:32:02,050
Since they gave me Loki back.

7648
04:32:03,170 --> 04:32:04,510
Should we ask if they're serious or not?

7649
04:32:04,910 --> 04:32:09,130
Wait, we need to know...

7650
04:32:13,810 --> 04:32:14,550
That's serious.

7651
04:32:15,710 --> 04:32:17,710
If you are not respecting ban...

7652
04:32:17,710 --> 04:32:18,450
I still don't know what's happening.

7653
04:32:18,990 --> 04:32:20,970
Respecting ban, we call for restart.

7654
04:32:24,350 --> 04:32:24,690
Alright.

7655
04:32:26,630 --> 04:32:27,410
I'm done with that.

7656
04:32:30,350 --> 04:32:31,310
I'm done with that.

7657
04:32:31,350 --> 04:32:31,570
Okay.

7658
04:32:31,570 --> 04:32:32,570
Okay, we restart then?

7659
04:32:32,670 --> 04:32:32,890
No, they're not.

7660
04:32:33,450 --> 04:32:34,070
Okay, we restart.

7661
04:32:34,550 --> 04:32:34,790
Oh, okay.

7662
04:32:36,250 --> 04:32:37,710
All it takes is a little bit of threat.

7663
04:32:37,870 --> 04:32:38,070
Yeah.

7664
04:32:38,310 --> 04:32:39,230
Yeah, because like...

7665
04:32:39,230 --> 04:32:39,250
What?

7666
04:32:39,790 --> 04:32:40,030
What?

7667
04:32:45,130 --> 04:32:45,850
I don't know.

7668
04:32:45,890 --> 04:32:46,770
I feel like it's not that big of a deal.

7669
04:32:46,890 --> 04:32:50,890
If someone forgot to ban on the other team, then I would be okay with it.

7670
04:32:50,970 --> 04:32:51,630
Yeah, of course.

7671
04:33:00,800 --> 04:33:02,360
I'm trying to make sure you guys are okay.

7672
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:04,720
Strange.

7673
04:33:04,880 --> 04:33:05,160
I got you.

7674
04:33:05,660 --> 04:33:06,000
Alright.

7675
04:33:09,380 --> 04:33:11,760
He's got a Mantis pocket on him.

7676
04:33:13,160 --> 04:33:14,740
Yeah, I'm trying to keep you up.

7677
04:33:15,240 --> 04:33:15,700
Got it.

7678
04:33:15,860 --> 04:33:17,660
If we have enough heals, I can go Mantis.

7679
04:33:18,160 --> 04:33:19,940
But we'll see for now.

7680
04:33:20,820 --> 04:33:21,000
Yep.

7681
04:33:22,440 --> 04:33:23,100
Might yep up.

7682
04:33:24,840 --> 04:33:26,280
Got slept, so that's down.

7683
04:33:27,640 --> 04:33:29,280
I'm still bonding for our kill.

7684
04:33:30,420 --> 04:33:32,040
I got you, I got you, I got you.

7685
04:33:33,760 --> 04:33:34,500
I got pulled in.

7686
04:33:37,360 --> 04:33:38,460
You guys are getting really low.

7687
04:33:38,460 --> 04:33:39,340
I don't have soul bond, so...

7688
04:33:41,200 --> 04:33:42,160
We have, we have, we have.

7689
04:33:42,200 --> 04:33:43,140
I got it, I got it.

7690
04:33:43,320 --> 04:33:44,500
Stay near him, stay near him.

7691
04:33:45,720 --> 04:33:46,660
They're gonna hide, they're gonna hide.

7692
04:33:46,920 --> 04:33:48,780
Yeah, I don't have soul bond yet, I don't have soul bond.

7693
04:33:49,120 --> 04:33:49,420
Backing out a little.

7694
04:33:52,080 --> 04:33:52,760
Only got me.

7695
04:33:53,120 --> 04:33:53,840
Nice, we're fine.

7696
04:33:54,900 --> 04:33:56,220
That's fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're alive.

7697
04:34:02,210 --> 04:34:03,530
Coney, you're really far from us.

7698
04:34:03,670 --> 04:34:04,910
Yeah, I know, I'm trying to come back.

7699
04:34:04,910 --> 04:34:05,170
Oh no.

7700
04:34:06,130 --> 04:34:07,610
I had the full lineup on me.

7701
04:34:07,630 --> 04:34:08,330
Oh, they stopped, they stopped.

7702
04:34:08,810 --> 04:34:10,850
I'm soul bonding, I'm soul bonding, I'm soul bonding for you.

7703
04:34:12,650 --> 04:34:13,810
I got left ult right after this.

7704
04:34:14,390 --> 04:34:14,630
Okay.

7705
04:34:18,390 --> 04:34:19,030
They trolled!

7706
04:34:19,150 --> 04:34:20,410
Oh my god, they trolled!

7707
04:34:21,670 --> 04:34:22,990
Wait, did I hit him?

7708
04:34:23,270 --> 04:34:25,130
Yes, you hit him when he broke the...

7709
04:34:25,130 --> 04:34:26,030
I'm one, I'm one, I'm one.

7710
04:34:26,070 --> 04:34:26,990
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

7711
04:34:27,910 --> 04:34:29,450
We have, we have rez if you die.

7712
04:34:30,090 --> 04:34:30,870
I have claw bolt.

7713
04:34:31,870 --> 04:34:32,890
The string is low, the string is low.

7714
04:34:33,250 --> 04:34:35,210
The string is back and the string is at full HP now.

7715
04:34:35,730 --> 04:34:36,770
I got the full back one.

7716
04:34:38,410 --> 04:34:40,550
String, string, string, string, string, string, string, string, string, nice.

7717
04:34:41,510 --> 04:34:41,870
Nice.

7718
04:34:43,270 --> 04:34:43,790
Very good.

7719
04:34:44,430 --> 04:34:45,110
I can run her down.

7720
04:34:45,510 --> 04:34:47,010
Get the mantis again, get the mantis, she's one.

7721
04:34:47,170 --> 04:34:47,450
Got it.

7722
04:34:47,570 --> 04:34:47,750
Nice.

7723
04:34:48,750 --> 04:34:49,670
What did they use?

7724
04:34:49,710 --> 04:34:53,270
They have storm ult, so we'll have to...

7725
04:34:53,810 --> 04:34:55,710
Lime, get the storm ult.

7726
04:34:56,550 --> 04:34:58,190
Yeah, you react first, you react first.

7727
04:34:58,470 --> 04:34:59,410
Did they change ult?

7728
04:34:59,630 --> 04:35:00,210
Did they change ult?

7729
04:35:00,430 --> 04:35:00,570
I know.

7730
04:35:01,790 --> 04:35:02,270
Yeah, they did.

7731
04:35:02,270 --> 04:35:03,130
They did, they did.

7732
04:35:11,950 --> 04:35:13,570
They're gonna have their support cycle soon.

7733
04:35:14,730 --> 04:35:15,610
Okay, run for Lime.

7734
04:35:25,760 --> 04:35:27,460
Okay, I'll keep you up, I'll keep you up.

7735
04:35:28,580 --> 04:35:28,900
Okay.

7736
04:35:31,720 --> 04:35:33,000
I can't keep him, I can't.

7737
04:35:40,600 --> 04:35:40,960
Okay.

7738
04:35:41,100 --> 04:35:42,440
Okay, okay, they pulled out their support ult.

7739
04:35:42,440 --> 04:35:43,240
They pulled two support ults here.

7740
04:35:44,980 --> 04:35:45,340
Thank you!

7741
04:35:46,380 --> 04:35:47,460
Nice, good job, good job.

7742
04:35:48,960 --> 04:35:50,200
Oh, I pushed them!

7743
04:35:50,300 --> 04:35:51,880
I pushed them into your thing, oh my god.

7744
04:35:53,020 --> 04:35:53,880
Oh my god.

7745
04:35:53,960 --> 04:35:54,800
Okay, I got back.

7746
04:35:58,640 --> 04:36:00,460
We have portal, we have portal.

7747
04:36:01,240 --> 04:36:04,220
Oh no, I actually pressed left click, that's my bad.

7748
04:36:04,880 --> 04:36:07,480
I killed one while I did it.

7749
04:36:07,620 --> 04:36:09,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got there.

7750
04:36:09,220 --> 04:36:10,860
Oh, he's portaling, he's portaling, he's trying to portal block.

7751
04:36:10,920 --> 04:36:13,340
Just get out, get out as fast as you can, get out as fast as you can.

7752
04:36:16,820 --> 04:36:17,760
We have portal.

7753
04:36:17,880 --> 04:36:19,720
He got me, but I just went through the portal because I'm invisible.

7754
04:36:20,060 --> 04:36:21,260
I'm just standing here.

7755
04:36:21,640 --> 04:36:21,900
Okay.

7756
04:36:22,560 --> 04:36:24,280
Sorry, I'm on it, I'm on it.

7757
04:36:25,380 --> 04:36:27,500
I didn't know you guys were there fast enough, sorry.

7758
04:36:27,920 --> 04:36:28,100
Fuck.

7759
04:36:29,280 --> 04:36:30,100
Nice, good job.

7760
04:36:32,360 --> 04:36:33,520
I soulbonded like I said.

7761
04:36:35,220 --> 04:36:36,320
I have a snap though.

7762
04:36:37,240 --> 04:36:38,040
That's okay, that's okay.

7763
04:36:39,100 --> 04:36:40,480
I got a snap again.

7764
04:36:42,100 --> 04:36:42,660
Storm's low.

7765
04:36:47,220 --> 04:36:48,160
I'm here, I'm here.

7766
04:36:50,220 --> 04:36:51,460
Yeah, I see her, I see her.

7767
04:36:51,940 --> 04:36:52,180
Nice.

7768
04:36:55,540 --> 04:36:57,020
Mantis, mantis, I got mantis.

7769
04:36:57,220 --> 04:36:58,580
Mantis, yeah, I see mantis.

7770
04:36:59,040 --> 04:36:59,440
Nice.

7771
04:37:00,920 --> 04:37:01,400
Gotcha.

7772
04:37:02,960 --> 04:37:04,140
Holy, bro.

7773
04:37:04,240 --> 04:37:04,820
What a hold.

7774
04:37:05,600 --> 04:37:06,920
Good shit, great hold.

7775
04:37:07,140 --> 04:37:07,980
We got it back, yeah.

7776
04:37:10,080 --> 04:37:10,560
Oh,

7777
04:37:17,780 --> 04:37:18,520
come on.

7778
04:37:18,740 --> 04:37:20,100
That battle clutch was so good.

7779
04:37:20,200 --> 04:37:21,060
That was a good clutch, yeah.

7780
04:37:21,200 --> 04:37:21,700
I think we're good.

7781
04:37:23,700 --> 04:37:24,760
It's kicking in.

7782
04:37:25,260 --> 04:37:25,640
Hell yeah.

7783
04:37:27,920 --> 04:37:29,080
Alright, coach.

7784
04:37:29,600 --> 04:37:30,620
I'm good, I'm good.

7785
04:37:31,860 --> 04:37:32,220
Alright.

7786
04:37:34,840 --> 04:37:41,280
Dude, the play where I pushed them into Coney's ult, it looked like it was going to be something massive, but then it just didn't end up that massive.

7787
04:37:41,600 --> 04:37:42,280
Fuck, man.

7788
04:37:42,360 --> 04:37:43,080
You're just like, no!

7789
04:37:43,080 --> 04:37:44,900
I was so scared because I was like, oh, that's five.

7790
04:37:45,180 --> 04:37:47,960
And I died for it, so I was like, alright, my team cleans this.

7791
04:37:48,140 --> 04:37:48,520
And then...

7792
04:37:48,520 --> 04:37:50,420
Yeah, we didn't get too much of it.

7793
04:37:50,540 --> 04:37:51,820
It felt so good though.

7794
04:37:53,520 --> 04:37:54,480
That's alright, we didn't lose.

7795
04:37:54,720 --> 04:37:56,220
If we lost, I'd be flaming you guys.

7796
04:38:01,180 --> 04:38:03,220
I had some really bad shit that game.

7797
04:38:04,340 --> 04:38:09,520
It was like a .20 seconds left when we stepped on from the point.

7798
04:38:09,520 --> 04:38:10,660
Yeah, that was crazy.

7799
04:38:11,140 --> 04:38:12,340
And you were so lucky.

7800
04:38:14,000 --> 04:38:17,260
Shota and I were alive, so we kept you up with like, Solvan and Emo.

7801
04:38:17,280 --> 04:38:19,720
Yeah, dude, I jumped on their Eisa.

7802
04:38:19,840 --> 04:38:22,620
Yeah, yeah, we like, kept them alive through everything.

7803
04:38:22,840 --> 04:38:23,560
It was so fucking scary.

7804
04:38:23,560 --> 04:38:24,300
And we have the DPS too.

7805
04:38:24,300 --> 04:38:25,020
It was really .20?

7806
04:38:25,860 --> 04:38:27,100
It was really low.

7807
04:38:27,540 --> 04:38:28,480
It was real low.

7808
04:38:29,040 --> 04:38:29,580
Alright, let's do it.

7809
04:38:31,000 --> 04:38:32,000
Free ult charge here.

7810
04:38:34,820 --> 04:38:36,020
We got them on this map.

7811
04:38:37,140 --> 04:38:37,420
Yeah.

7812
04:38:38,040 --> 04:38:39,160
We just need one point.

7813
04:38:39,280 --> 04:38:39,360
Damn.

7814
04:38:42,640 --> 04:38:46,240
Oh, I got absolutely shredded there.

7815
04:38:50,240 --> 04:38:50,940
Still top.

7816
04:38:51,380 --> 04:38:52,180
That's alright, we're still pushing.

7817
04:38:52,700 --> 04:38:53,200
That's fine.

7818
04:38:53,780 --> 04:38:54,680
I just don't have rez though.

7819
04:38:55,500 --> 04:38:57,320
I'm keeping you up with my...

7820
04:38:57,320 --> 04:38:58,700
...snaps if I can.

7821
04:38:59,160 --> 04:38:59,880
And I get it.

7822
04:39:00,540 --> 04:39:01,920
Can someone heal Gomez real quick?

7823
04:39:03,060 --> 04:39:03,240
Mhm.

7824
04:39:04,500 --> 04:39:05,720
I got you, I got you, I got you.

7825
04:39:05,780 --> 04:39:06,040
I got him.

7826
04:39:07,020 --> 04:39:08,880
I soulbonded, I soulbonded, I soulbonded.

7827
04:39:11,940 --> 04:39:12,960
I like that shit.

7828
04:39:16,660 --> 04:39:17,280
I got you.

7829
04:39:18,740 --> 04:39:19,400
Tracer, Tracer, Tracer!

7830
04:39:19,620 --> 04:39:19,900
Nice!

7831
04:39:20,700 --> 04:39:21,620
Yo, okay, we go.

7832
04:39:21,880 --> 04:39:22,480
I don't have anything.

7833
04:39:22,480 --> 04:39:23,520
I got all three backline.

7834
04:39:23,780 --> 04:39:24,740
Coming back, coming back.

7835
04:39:25,480 --> 04:39:26,840
I have no soulbond, I have no soulbond.

7836
04:39:27,300 --> 04:39:28,400
Look at that, look at that, look at that.

7837
04:39:28,400 --> 04:39:29,840
All dead.

7838
04:39:30,240 --> 04:39:31,020
I need a heal back here.

7839
04:39:31,100 --> 04:39:31,340
Got her?

7840
04:39:31,620 --> 04:39:32,760
I win it, yeah.

7841
04:39:33,660 --> 04:39:35,100
We had no support ults there.

7842
04:39:38,040 --> 04:39:40,000
You only have low heals, you only have low heals.

7843
04:39:40,640 --> 04:39:41,840
Yeah, we just build ults.

7844
04:39:42,760 --> 04:39:43,540
I have ults up.

7845
04:39:44,120 --> 04:39:44,300
It's fine.

7846
04:39:44,720 --> 04:39:45,600
Or, I will soon.

7847
04:39:47,020 --> 04:39:48,020
Okay, of course they're all up.

7848
04:39:48,180 --> 04:39:48,620
Yeah, got them.

7849
04:39:49,120 --> 04:39:50,060
We have one of the ults first off.

7850
04:39:50,280 --> 04:39:51,340
Pop it when this is over?

7851
04:39:51,420 --> 04:39:53,340
Yeah, pop it when it's over so we can get another support ult off.

7852
04:39:53,480 --> 04:39:54,240
I got the whole backline!

7853
04:39:54,700 --> 04:39:55,180
All of them!

7854
04:39:55,600 --> 04:39:56,160
Nice, nice, nice!

7855
04:39:56,200 --> 04:39:56,860
Oh, he's right.

7856
04:39:57,840 --> 04:40:00,060
I went to the one person that was inside the ult.

7857
04:40:01,500 --> 04:40:02,260
I still bonded us.

7858
04:40:02,440 --> 04:40:03,000
Reset, reset.

7859
04:40:03,560 --> 04:40:03,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7860
04:40:04,040 --> 04:40:04,520
Get out.

7861
04:40:04,660 --> 04:40:05,260
Alright, resetting.

7862
04:40:05,600 --> 04:40:06,900
I'm just dying, I'm just dying.

7863
04:40:07,420 --> 04:40:07,580
Okay.

7864
04:40:07,900 --> 04:40:08,120
Yeah.

7865
04:40:09,220 --> 04:40:09,660
We can TP.

7866
04:40:09,780 --> 04:40:10,460
Just die, just die, just die.

7867
04:40:10,760 --> 04:40:11,420
We TP, we TP.

7868
04:40:11,520 --> 04:40:11,880
Die and TP.

7869
04:40:12,040 --> 04:40:12,360
Yeah, that's okay.

7870
04:40:12,780 --> 04:40:13,720
I have rez too.

7871
04:40:14,820 --> 04:40:17,780
You guys use TP, I walk over because I have rez.

7872
04:40:18,400 --> 04:40:18,740
Okay.

7873
04:40:18,980 --> 04:40:19,260
Oh, okay.

7874
04:40:19,260 --> 04:40:20,460
We also have lime ult.

7875
04:40:20,580 --> 04:40:21,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7876
04:40:21,680 --> 04:40:22,700
TP, TP, TP, TP.

7877
04:40:22,880 --> 04:40:23,700
I rez, I rez.

7878
04:40:23,880 --> 04:40:24,280
TP, TP, TP, TP.

7879
04:40:24,640 --> 04:40:25,780
We should TP behind them, right?

7880
04:40:26,860 --> 04:40:27,020
Yeah.

7881
04:40:29,200 --> 04:40:30,040
I'm gonna ult you too, okay?

7882
04:40:30,040 --> 04:40:31,880
Do you want me to ult or just let people die for the rez?

7883
04:40:33,220 --> 04:40:33,980
I'll die for the rez.

7884
04:40:34,320 --> 04:40:34,960
Yeah, die for the rez.

7885
04:40:35,660 --> 04:40:35,940
Okay.

7886
04:40:36,320 --> 04:40:36,840
Where the fuck am I?

7887
04:40:37,360 --> 04:40:38,460
Oh my god, I got...

7888
04:40:38,460 --> 04:40:41,140
I got Agamotto'd.

7889
04:40:42,920 --> 04:40:43,940
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

7890
04:40:44,040 --> 04:40:45,340
I still bonded, I still bonded us.

7891
04:40:45,420 --> 04:40:45,840
Good, good, good.

7892
04:40:45,880 --> 04:40:46,220
I'm ulting.

7893
04:40:47,260 --> 04:40:47,780
Nice, nice, nice!

7894
04:40:47,820 --> 04:40:48,320
Oh my god!

7895
04:40:49,080 --> 04:40:50,260
They didn't expect that shit!

7896
04:40:50,760 --> 04:40:52,000
It's the big episode!

7897
04:40:52,200 --> 04:40:53,360
Three, three, three, three, three, three!

7898
04:40:53,480 --> 04:40:53,900
Holy moly!

7899
04:40:54,280 --> 04:40:54,980
Oh, we died, we died.

7900
04:40:55,020 --> 04:40:55,140
Okay.

7901
04:40:55,140 --> 04:40:57,220
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

7902
04:40:57,260 --> 04:40:59,580
It's okay, our Dr. Strange one trick has this.

7903
04:41:01,420 --> 04:41:04,220
Push up, push up, push up, push up.

7904
04:41:04,720 --> 04:41:12,840
The invisible woman ult into the surprise Dr. Strange ult.

7905
04:41:13,400 --> 04:41:17,320
Did you walk up and ult it or did you fly up?

7906
04:41:17,680 --> 04:41:18,500
I flew.

7907
04:41:18,760 --> 04:41:20,740
Oh my god, look at that, the trading!

7908
04:41:21,780 --> 04:41:23,800
Oh, Mr. Dootrick did it!

7909
04:41:23,800 --> 04:41:24,980
Oh my god, the Dootrick!

7910
04:41:26,360 --> 04:41:27,400
Holy shit!

7911
04:41:27,780 --> 04:41:29,980
His second trick is even better than the first!

7912
04:41:31,300 --> 04:41:32,720
Oh my god!

7913
04:41:34,980 --> 04:41:36,940
Oh my god, it paid off.

7914
04:41:37,040 --> 04:41:37,820
Two weeks!

7915
04:41:37,880 --> 04:41:40,220
All it took you was two weeks to learn that.

7916
04:41:40,580 --> 04:41:41,700
That's crazy.

7917
04:41:42,080 --> 04:41:42,680
Good shit.

7918
04:41:43,000 --> 04:41:43,540
Put in the work.

7919
04:41:46,120 --> 04:41:46,640
Finals!

7920
04:41:46,840 --> 04:41:47,380
Let's get it!

7921
04:41:47,460 --> 04:41:49,640
The finals, the grand finals!

7922
04:41:49,940 --> 04:41:50,980
We made it!

7923
04:41:50,980 --> 04:41:52,400
We did it!

7924
04:41:52,640 --> 04:41:53,520
Yay, we did it!

7925
04:41:53,580 --> 04:41:56,300
We might actually play RIGC again, too.

7926
04:41:57,340 --> 04:41:58,400
I'm so dead right now.

7927
04:41:58,500 --> 04:41:59,920
Okay, go fix yourself.

7928
04:42:00,220 --> 04:42:03,040
Go do something.

7929
04:42:03,560 --> 04:42:05,960
Yeah, something, something that works.

7930
04:42:07,240 --> 04:42:08,200
We'll win this finals.

7931
04:42:09,060 --> 04:42:09,420
Yeah.

7932
04:42:10,220 --> 04:42:12,160
Is finals after the losers finals?

7933
04:42:12,360 --> 04:42:13,180
Yeah, it should be.

7934
04:42:13,360 --> 04:42:14,740
I can confirm.

7935
04:42:15,940 --> 04:42:18,460
Well, it has to be because we can't play at the same time.

7936
04:42:18,460 --> 04:42:20,960
Yeah, they have to.

7937
04:42:21,080 --> 04:42:21,920
Yeah, obviously.

7938
04:42:22,200 --> 04:42:23,820
So they have one match, though, right?

7939
04:42:24,120 --> 04:42:24,520
Or...

7940
04:42:24,520 --> 04:42:25,440
We have at least one.

7941
04:42:27,220 --> 04:42:28,120
More drugs, I'll be back.

7942
04:42:28,280 --> 04:42:29,340
Alright, let me look at it.

7943
04:42:29,380 --> 04:42:29,980
Yeah, I'm gonna be right back as well.

7944
04:42:30,060 --> 04:42:31,100
I'm gonna stand up and walk around.

7945
04:42:31,580 --> 04:42:33,800
You gotta cool down after that.

7946
04:42:34,940 --> 04:42:35,460
I'll allow it.

7947
04:42:35,480 --> 04:42:37,140
It says the winner's final is first.

7948
04:42:37,660 --> 04:42:39,020
Yeah, losers semi-final.

7949
04:42:39,480 --> 04:42:40,580
Oh, the grand finals.

7950
04:42:40,580 --> 04:42:41,720
That's winners finals, I promise.

7951
04:42:42,640 --> 04:42:43,920
Yeah, we were winners finals.

7952
04:42:44,400 --> 04:42:46,600
So they're doing losers semi-final.

7953
04:42:46,600 --> 04:42:48,760
Wait, what's losers finale?

7954
04:42:49,640 --> 04:42:50,500
What the fuck is that?

7955
04:42:50,720 --> 04:42:52,040
That's losers finals, probably.

7956
04:42:53,040 --> 04:42:54,220
Wait, let me look at the chat.

7957
04:42:54,260 --> 04:42:56,500
It's winners finals, then losers finals, then grand finals.

7958
04:42:57,220 --> 04:42:57,680
The fuck?

7959
04:42:57,740 --> 04:42:58,580
That's so confusing.

7960
04:43:00,240 --> 04:43:02,260
You guys don't know tournament, bro.

7961
04:43:03,680 --> 04:43:07,700
Okay, so what it is, is both the teams that won every set play.

7962
04:43:07,800 --> 04:43:08,700
That's what we just did.

7963
04:43:09,300 --> 04:43:11,720
Then the loser of that goes into losers.

7964
04:43:12,020 --> 04:43:15,560
And then the winner of the whole losers bracket faces us again.

7965
04:43:15,560 --> 04:43:16,020
Yeah.

7966
04:43:16,240 --> 04:43:19,100
And then we have to lose two sets.

7967
04:43:19,360 --> 04:43:20,180
Ah, I see.

7968
04:43:20,400 --> 04:43:24,020
We play them, but we haven't lost yet, so we get two sets.

7969
04:43:24,280 --> 04:43:25,240
You know what I'm saying?

7970
04:43:25,380 --> 04:43:26,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7971
04:43:26,880 --> 04:43:28,040
So now we just wait a while.

7972
04:43:28,080 --> 04:43:30,700
Why does it say losers finale twice?

7973
04:43:30,940 --> 04:43:31,400
I don't know.

7974
04:43:31,600 --> 04:43:33,220
Then they messed up the schedule.

7975
04:43:33,460 --> 04:43:34,060
They messed it up.

7976
04:43:34,120 --> 04:43:34,660
It should be flipped.

7977
04:43:36,680 --> 04:43:37,160
Oh, wait.

7978
04:43:37,380 --> 04:43:38,260
Let me look at the schedule.

7979
04:43:38,280 --> 04:43:38,740
Yeah, look.

7980
04:43:38,760 --> 04:43:40,460
It says grand finale at the end.

7981
04:43:40,460 --> 04:43:46,780
But then there's losers of the grand finale that plays after for third place.

7982
04:43:48,460 --> 04:43:49,580
No, that makes sense.

7983
04:43:49,700 --> 04:43:49,860
Oh.

7984
04:43:50,100 --> 04:43:52,540
Yeah, no, because the two losers will play each other.

7985
04:43:52,640 --> 04:43:53,600
The winner will play us.

7986
04:43:53,700 --> 04:43:54,760
And then it'll be one, two, three.

7987
04:43:54,760 --> 04:43:56,840
Sorry, I'm a little special today.

7988
04:43:56,840 --> 04:43:57,720
We play the king of the losers.

7989
04:43:57,720 --> 04:43:57,980
No, you're good.

7990
04:43:58,000 --> 04:43:59,320
Yeah, the king of the losers.

7991
04:43:59,720 --> 04:44:02,080
Oh, we're playing the king of the losers.

7992
04:44:02,540 --> 04:44:02,880
Okay.

7993
04:44:03,680 --> 04:44:05,000
Guys, I don't get it.

7994
04:44:05,000 --> 04:44:05,960
Can you draw it and paint?

7995
04:44:07,020 --> 04:44:08,580
I thought for a second you were going to say guys.

7996
04:44:08,580 --> 04:44:10,900
It was that kind of voice.

7997
04:44:11,000 --> 04:44:11,960
I got really scared.

7998
04:44:12,500 --> 04:44:14,980
I was like, Bettle, what happened, Bettle?

7999
04:44:17,120 --> 04:44:19,320
Dude, we are so far behind schedule.

8000
04:44:19,540 --> 04:44:20,240
Look at the time.

8001
04:44:20,500 --> 04:44:21,460
Oh, my God.

8002
04:44:21,920 --> 04:44:23,760
We're in grand finale.

8003
04:44:25,080 --> 04:44:25,800
Grand finals.

8004
04:44:25,820 --> 04:44:28,420
I was like, yo, with the timings, I can probably stream afterwards.

8005
04:44:28,880 --> 04:44:29,500
No, unlikely.

8006
04:44:30,320 --> 04:44:32,540
Wait, we have a long time before our next game.

8007
04:44:33,920 --> 04:44:36,060
Yeah, is it ranked time again?

8008
04:44:37,420 --> 04:44:38,420
I mean...

8009
04:44:38,580 --> 04:44:40,440
I just want to chill, I'm not going to lie.

8010
04:44:40,680 --> 04:44:41,380
I don't really want to play anymore.

8011
04:44:41,480 --> 04:44:42,560
I think it's better to chill.

8012
04:44:42,660 --> 04:44:44,000
Give Go Gomez time to chill, too.

8013
04:44:44,180 --> 04:44:45,140
Yeah, Gomez needs time to chill.

8014
04:44:45,500 --> 04:44:47,040
Yeah, I mean...

8015
04:44:47,040 --> 04:44:49,820
I mean, we made it to grand finals, guys.

8016
04:44:50,080 --> 04:44:50,920
We made it to grand.

8017
04:44:51,160 --> 04:44:51,500
Yeah.

8018
04:44:52,280 --> 04:44:52,720
We earned it.

8019
04:44:52,720 --> 04:44:53,740
We earned it for a second.

8020
04:44:55,540 --> 04:44:57,140
The whole world is against us.

8021
04:44:57,360 --> 04:45:01,200
We actually practiced so well the past couple of weeks.

8022
04:45:01,320 --> 04:45:04,200
Because the first time we fought and scrimmed against them, it felt really tough.

8023
04:45:04,320 --> 04:45:06,860
Yeah, we were getting absolutely demolished.

8024
04:45:06,880 --> 04:45:07,560
We got mauled.

8025
04:45:08,320 --> 04:45:10,460
The 3-3 was kind of like a...

8026
04:45:10,460 --> 04:45:11,900
Maybe a crutch or just like...

8027
04:45:11,900 --> 04:45:15,560
Because it wasn't very flexible, since we had to stick with that to deal with them.

8028
04:45:15,620 --> 04:45:18,180
But now, it's like we actually managed to deal with it properly.

8029
04:45:18,420 --> 04:45:18,860
Yeah, yeah.

8030
04:45:18,860 --> 04:45:20,860
We all learned more, too.

8031
04:45:21,380 --> 04:45:23,040
It was like two weeks of practice.

8032
04:45:23,280 --> 04:45:26,460
It took us two weeks to figure everything out, which is crazy.

8033
04:45:28,560 --> 04:45:31,940
We nearly did like a boot camp.

8034
04:45:33,480 --> 04:45:33,860
Yeah.

8035
04:45:35,580 --> 04:45:35,980
Alright.

8036
04:45:35,980 --> 04:45:37,160
Let me go to the bathroom.

8037
04:45:37,280 --> 04:45:37,660
I'll be back.

8038
04:45:38,520 --> 04:45:39,400
It's funny.

8039
04:45:39,580 --> 04:45:41,880
The whole world is against us.

8040
04:45:42,000 --> 04:45:43,160
Everybody's getting sick.

8041
04:45:44,600 --> 04:45:45,940
PCs are breaking.

8042
04:45:47,280 --> 04:45:49,060
I really don't know what mine was about.

8043
04:45:49,260 --> 04:45:51,740
It was like twice in a row when it's never happened before.

8044
04:45:51,920 --> 04:45:54,000
And it's not happened again, Touchwood.

8045
04:45:54,200 --> 04:45:55,200
So it's just like...

8046
04:45:55,200 --> 04:45:57,200
Yeah, the amount of times...

8047
04:45:58,800 --> 04:46:01,500
We've asked for like...

8048
04:46:01,500 --> 04:46:02,560
Give us a sec, guys.

8049
04:46:02,640 --> 04:46:03,660
Something's going on.

8050
04:46:07,920 --> 04:46:09,220
I had to threaten...

8051
04:46:09,220 --> 04:46:11,080
I had to threaten that team.

8052
04:46:12,620 --> 04:46:14,760
Like, don't respect me, restart.

8053
04:46:17,420 --> 04:46:18,840
Alright, I'm here.

8054
04:46:18,920 --> 04:46:19,340
Are you okay?

8055
04:46:19,740 --> 04:46:20,990
We have a lot of time before...

8056
04:46:22,500 --> 04:46:22,880
How much time?

8057
04:46:23,360 --> 04:46:29,880
They have to run the best of three for the loser bracket.

8058
04:46:31,160 --> 04:46:31,700
Oh, boy.

8059
04:46:31,960 --> 04:46:32,080
Alright.

8060
04:46:32,160 --> 04:46:34,020
So it's Mace versus Riggzy's team again.

8061
04:46:35,900 --> 04:46:37,500
Okay, that sounds good.

8062
04:46:38,060 --> 04:46:38,260
Yeah.

8063
04:46:38,680 --> 04:46:40,480
So, are you sure you're okay now?

8064
04:46:40,560 --> 04:46:42,100
Do you need to...

8065
04:46:42,100 --> 04:46:44,020
Yeah, I'm gonna just chill and...

8066
04:46:44,020 --> 04:46:46,680
This guy's been asking for a VOD review for like the past few days.

8067
04:46:46,820 --> 04:46:50,500
Like, he's been like, make a channel point system for VOD review.

8068
04:46:50,620 --> 04:46:51,420
Like, please, I want it.

8069
04:46:51,560 --> 04:46:52,760
And it's like, okay, just ask me.

8070
04:46:52,840 --> 04:46:53,320
You don't need to...

8071
04:46:53,320 --> 04:46:54,680
I don't need to make a channel point thing.

8072
04:46:55,440 --> 04:46:56,580
It's like a...

8073
04:46:56,580 --> 04:46:57,760
I'm gonna just do that for now.

8074
04:46:58,380 --> 04:47:00,400
Are you sure you're gonna be okay for that?

8075
04:47:01,200 --> 04:47:02,920
Yeah, it's just reviewing.

8076
04:47:05,160 --> 04:47:06,980
Alright, don't throw up mid-review.

8077
04:47:07,320 --> 04:47:10,720
Oh, no, I don't feel like vomiting anymore.

8078
04:47:10,740 --> 04:47:11,980
I just feel like shit.

8079
04:47:12,220 --> 04:47:12,400
Yeah.

8080
04:47:12,460 --> 04:47:12,740
That's it.

8081
04:47:13,920 --> 04:47:14,980
Alright, you guys do that.

8082
04:47:15,060 --> 04:47:16,360
I'm gonna do a sponsored stream.

8083
04:47:16,500 --> 04:47:20,000
So, if anybody wants to come by, I get more for every viewer.

8084
04:47:20,160 --> 04:47:21,620
So, I'm gonna play some Mecha Break.

8085
04:47:21,860 --> 04:47:23,400
If anybody wants to play Mecha Break.

8086
04:47:24,660 --> 04:47:27,460
Alright, I have to play it for an hour.

8087
04:47:27,880 --> 04:47:29,260
So, I'll see you guys in an hour.

8088
04:47:30,520 --> 04:47:31,380
Yeah, it's a bounty.

8089
04:47:31,640 --> 04:47:32,200
Oh, shit.

8090
04:47:33,260 --> 04:47:34,200
Tell me how much...

8091
04:47:34,200 --> 04:47:34,720
We got an hour break.

8092
04:47:35,640 --> 04:47:36,700
I'll tell you later.

8093
04:47:37,840 --> 04:47:38,240
Alright.

8094
04:47:38,680 --> 04:47:39,380
Oh, okay.

8095
04:47:39,960 --> 04:47:41,340
I'm just gonna chit-chat for a few.

8096
04:47:41,480 --> 04:47:42,020
Yeah, me too.

8097
04:47:42,100 --> 04:47:43,500
I'm gonna chat on my stream then.

8098
04:47:43,720 --> 04:47:44,320
I'll be chill.

8099
04:47:44,940 --> 04:47:45,920
I might watch the...

8100
04:47:48,200 --> 04:47:49,780
The loser bracket then.

8101
04:47:50,020 --> 04:47:51,080
Yeah, it's Mace vs.

8102
04:47:51,560 --> 04:47:52,140
Riggzy's team.

8103
04:47:52,680 --> 04:47:53,880
Is anyone else watching it?

8104
04:47:53,880 --> 04:47:54,580
We can all watch together.

8105
04:47:54,900 --> 04:47:56,120
I'm watching it.

8106
04:47:56,200 --> 04:47:57,320
I'll watch it together.

8107
04:47:57,400 --> 04:47:58,420
Which channel is it on?

8108
04:47:58,620 --> 04:48:00,420
While I do the VOD review.

8109
04:48:00,740 --> 04:48:01,680
Which channel do we watch?

8110
04:48:01,680 --> 04:48:03,500
I mean, there's the Marble Rivals channel.

8111
04:48:03,740 --> 04:48:05,160
There's Mace is streaming it.

8112
04:48:05,660 --> 04:48:06,360
I believe.

8113
04:48:07,060 --> 04:48:08,120
I wanna watch it real time.

8114
04:48:08,700 --> 04:48:09,820
Yeah, I mean Mace is not...

8115
04:48:09,820 --> 04:48:11,020
There's no delay on Mace's side.

8116
04:48:11,820 --> 04:48:13,560
I feel like we're gonna fight Riggzy's team.

8117
04:48:13,860 --> 04:48:14,740
I feel like...

8118
04:48:16,180 --> 04:48:17,500
Riggzy's team 2-0'd them.

8119
04:48:19,900 --> 04:48:20,780
So, like...

8120
04:48:20,780 --> 04:48:21,560
I don't know.

8121
04:48:23,140 --> 04:48:24,680
Because if I'm gonna watch...

8122
04:48:27,160 --> 04:48:29,900
I feel like I might watch Riggzy's team just to see how they do.

8123
04:48:31,680 --> 04:48:32,400
Let me see.

8124
04:48:32,660 --> 04:48:33,460
Oh, Riggzy's streaming.

8125
04:48:33,800 --> 04:48:34,060
Okay.

8126
04:48:45,270 --> 04:48:47,570
I, like, open up Riggzy's...

8127
04:48:48,020 --> 04:48:49,570
I open up Riggzy's stream.

8128
04:48:49,790 --> 04:48:52,870
And they're like, This Adam fucked us up.

8129
04:48:53,610 --> 04:48:55,930
Their revives had too much value.

8130
04:48:58,730 --> 04:48:59,570
That's me.

8131
04:49:00,950 --> 04:49:02,830
Those were crazy rezzes.

8132
04:49:03,070 --> 04:49:04,770
Yeah, those were really good rezzes there.

8133
04:49:05,830 --> 04:49:07,450
Yeah, like, me just walking over.

8134
04:49:07,590 --> 04:49:10,010
I was just, like, strolling over with the revive.

8135
04:49:10,010 --> 04:49:11,190
At the end.

8136
04:49:11,270 --> 04:49:12,050
It was really funny.

8137
04:49:12,130 --> 04:49:14,510
The revive into the sualt to hide us.

8138
04:49:14,670 --> 04:49:17,710
And then fucking Strange just comes out like, Surprise, motherfuckers!

8139
04:49:17,890 --> 04:49:21,790
He just comes out of the portal and is like, Here's my ult.

8140
04:49:29,270 --> 04:49:30,310
They didn't...

8141
04:49:30,310 --> 04:49:32,650
They did not like my Adam.

8142
04:49:34,470 --> 04:49:35,210
That's right.

8143
04:49:35,230 --> 04:49:36,930
I'm not a one trick no more.

8144
04:49:37,170 --> 04:49:39,310
I haven't been since season 0.

8145
04:49:40,150 --> 04:49:40,670
Hahaha.

8146
04:49:47,870 --> 04:49:48,710
Let's see.

8147
04:49:57,950 --> 04:49:58,890
I've evolved.

8148
04:50:04,850 --> 04:50:05,910
That's funny though.

8149
04:50:05,930 --> 04:50:06,550
That's so funny.

8150
04:50:06,590 --> 04:50:07,270
I didn't think my...

8151
04:50:07,270 --> 04:50:09,850
I didn't think my Adam...

8152
04:50:10,690 --> 04:50:14,250
I didn't think my Adam was...

8153
04:50:14,250 --> 04:50:15,030
That good.

8154
04:50:15,150 --> 04:50:16,890
So it's funny that people think...

8155
04:50:16,890 --> 04:50:17,830
Like, it was scary.

8156
04:50:18,050 --> 04:50:18,410
Hahaha.

8157
04:50:18,410 --> 04:50:18,630
That's funny.

8158
04:50:19,210 --> 04:50:19,650
Hahaha.

8159
04:50:21,370 --> 04:50:22,770
I didn't think it was...

8160
04:50:22,770 --> 04:50:23,710
I honestly didn't think it was...

8161
04:50:23,710 --> 04:50:25,030
I don't play Adam that much.

8162
04:50:25,190 --> 04:50:25,630
Honestly.

8163
04:50:25,730 --> 04:50:27,510
I only pull him out when, like, it's meta.

8164
04:50:28,550 --> 04:50:31,810
When it's meta and, like, we don't have an Adam player.

8165
04:50:32,670 --> 04:50:34,770
Like, if we have a comp that needs it.

8166
04:50:46,050 --> 04:50:48,150
I have a high win rate on Adam.

8167
04:50:48,530 --> 04:50:49,050
I do.

8168
04:50:49,510 --> 04:50:50,950
But they haven't started their game yet.

8169
04:50:50,970 --> 04:50:52,430
So, I'm just waiting for it.

8170
04:50:54,210 --> 04:50:56,230
I've always had a high win rate with Adam.

8171
04:50:56,990 --> 04:50:58,790
Since, like, I'm pretty sure.

8172
04:50:59,130 --> 04:50:59,330
Right?

8173
04:50:59,570 --> 04:51:00,450
Statistically wise.

8174
04:51:02,470 --> 04:51:02,870
Not...

8175
04:51:02,870 --> 04:51:04,610
Okay, I played, like, one game.

8176
04:51:04,750 --> 04:51:05,050
Look at that.

8177
04:51:05,350 --> 04:51:05,750
My...

8178
04:51:05,750 --> 04:51:06,210
Hahaha.

8179
04:51:06,630 --> 04:51:07,030
Look at that.

8180
04:51:07,250 --> 04:51:08,470
100% win rate.

8181
04:51:08,730 --> 04:51:09,130
Hahaha.

8182
04:51:11,150 --> 04:51:12,310
And I think I played more.

8183
04:51:12,610 --> 04:51:14,050
This one was not that great though.

8184
04:51:14,130 --> 04:51:14,950
This one was not.

8185
04:51:15,690 --> 04:51:16,090
Season...

8186
04:51:16,090 --> 04:51:17,750
Like, I had a high win rate on Adam.

8187
04:51:17,770 --> 04:51:19,710
But then I had to play him a lot at one point.

8188
04:51:20,750 --> 04:51:21,450
Look at that.

8189
04:51:21,450 --> 04:51:23,710
My 100% win rate.

8190
04:51:23,950 --> 04:51:24,250
Wow.

8191
04:51:24,850 --> 04:51:25,570
Wowee.

8192
04:51:25,830 --> 04:51:26,410
Hahaha.

8193
04:51:29,350 --> 04:51:34,070
And then my 100% win rate on Luna.

8194
04:51:34,430 --> 04:51:34,790
Hahaha.

8195
04:51:37,010 --> 04:51:38,470
She's so cool.

8196
04:51:38,930 --> 04:51:39,370
Hahaha.

8197
04:51:41,410 --> 04:51:42,130
Wowee.

8198
04:51:43,390 --> 04:51:44,530
It's a sign.

8199
04:51:45,830 --> 04:51:47,250
And my win rate's...

8200
04:51:47,250 --> 04:51:49,130
I mean, my Mantis win rate was really good too.

8201
04:51:50,570 --> 04:51:51,530
And then...

8202
04:51:51,530 --> 04:51:52,390
There's a...

8203
04:51:52,390 --> 04:51:52,870
Hahaha.

8204
04:51:53,510 --> 04:51:55,710
My Rocket Raccoon win rate.

8205
04:51:55,950 --> 04:51:56,490
Hahaha.

8206
04:51:58,930 --> 04:52:03,230
Yeah, this is the reason why I don't play these two characters very often.

8207
04:52:04,390 --> 04:52:05,830
Why am I low-key here?

8208
04:52:06,250 --> 04:52:07,370
Yeah, I mean, it's alright.

8209
04:52:09,170 --> 04:52:10,290
5, 6...

8210
04:52:10,970 --> 04:52:11,530
Cloak...

8211
04:52:11,530 --> 04:52:11,990
Luna...

8212
04:52:11,990 --> 04:52:13,210
That's a high win rate for Luna.

8213
04:52:14,030 --> 04:52:14,550
I'm glad.

8214
04:52:14,630 --> 04:52:16,570
I'm glad I started improving more and more.

8215
04:52:17,110 --> 04:52:18,370
From this win rate...

8216
04:52:18,370 --> 04:52:19,290
This is a good win rate.

8217
04:52:19,470 --> 04:52:20,950
To this win rate.

8218
04:52:23,510 --> 04:52:25,110
I mean, they banned Adam and Luna?

8219
04:52:25,310 --> 04:52:26,510
They're fucking stupid.

8220
04:52:27,330 --> 04:52:29,370
That frees up our entire team.

8221
04:52:37,980 --> 04:52:39,080
That frees up...

8222
04:52:41,420 --> 04:52:44,900
That frees up our entire team to play the best they can play.

8223
04:52:45,860 --> 04:52:49,020
And literally, we have Sue, Cloak, Adam...

8224
04:52:49,760 --> 04:52:50,620
Oh wait, not Adam.

8225
04:52:50,720 --> 04:52:51,280
They banned Adam.

8226
04:52:51,380 --> 04:52:53,300
We have Sue, Cloak, and...

8227
04:52:54,220 --> 04:52:55,320
Where are my other supports?

8228
04:52:55,700 --> 04:52:56,440
I guess Rocket.

8229
04:52:58,760 --> 04:52:59,860
And I can still play.

8230
04:52:59,920 --> 04:53:00,960
I can still play stuff.

8231
04:53:01,440 --> 04:53:02,000
And low-key.

8232
04:53:02,180 --> 04:53:02,560
And Mantis.

8233
04:53:02,600 --> 04:53:03,940
Yeah, we can run Mantis too.

8234
04:53:11,850 --> 04:53:12,730
Let's see...

8235
04:53:12,730 --> 04:53:15,850
I feel like they're just going to always try to give Riggzy Star-Lord.

8236
04:53:16,790 --> 04:53:17,870
As much as they can.

8237
04:53:19,890 --> 04:53:20,830
Alright, let me see.

8238
04:53:20,990 --> 04:53:21,710
Let me write this.

8239
04:53:21,930 --> 04:53:23,010
Waiting for match.

8240
04:53:24,490 --> 04:53:25,370
Watching the...

8241
04:53:25,850 --> 04:53:27,850
Watching the loser fight.

8242
04:53:30,690 --> 04:53:31,730
Alright, here we go.

8243
04:53:32,830 --> 04:53:33,870
I'll just do this.

8244
04:53:34,590 --> 04:53:35,930
We are in Grand Finals.

8245
04:53:36,330 --> 04:53:38,370
I'm watching the loser finals right now.

8246
04:53:41,940 --> 04:53:46,900
I think the moment we get rid of Sue, it gets even easier for us too.

8247
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:48,500
Because they have a Sue one trick.

8248
04:53:55,280 --> 04:53:55,840
What POV?

8249
04:53:57,760 --> 04:53:59,880
There's Mace, Riggzy...

8250
04:53:59,880 --> 04:54:02,100
I'm watching Riggzy right now.

8251
04:54:02,100 --> 04:54:03,240
Just because...

8252
04:54:03,240 --> 04:54:08,120
I think we're playing against Riggzy next.

8253
04:54:10,000 --> 04:54:12,540
Because Riggzy 2-0ed Mace.

8254
04:54:12,880 --> 04:54:16,740
But if Mace wins this round, I'll swap my POV to Mace's stream.

8255
04:54:19,830 --> 04:54:23,340
I'm watching Riggzy's team just because...

8256
04:54:23,890 --> 04:54:27,180
Just because I think we're fighting them next and I just want to see how they play.

8257
04:54:28,860 --> 04:54:30,220
No, none of them stream on YouTube.

8258
04:54:30,220 --> 04:54:32,480
I think I'm the only one that streams on...

8259
04:54:32,480 --> 04:54:35,740
Me and Beto are the only ones that are streaming on YouTube for this tournament.

8260
04:54:36,580 --> 04:54:38,540
I mean, there might be others but...

8261
04:54:38,540 --> 04:54:40,940
From what I know, in the Grand Finals...

8262
04:54:40,940 --> 04:54:41,900
Or like in the Finals.

8263
04:54:42,760 --> 04:54:44,960
They like to TP the point for Koth.

8264
04:54:46,040 --> 04:54:46,740
Watching it.

8265
04:54:49,640 --> 04:54:50,280
That's funny.

8266
04:54:50,360 --> 04:54:53,600
Riggzy's like, Why is there so many people watching my stream right now?

8267
04:54:53,620 --> 04:54:56,080
And then it's just us analyzing their team.

8268
04:54:57,620 --> 04:55:00,920
HAHAHAHA We're just watching.

8269
04:55:04,120 --> 04:55:06,340
We're just figuring out their team.

8270
04:55:07,440 --> 04:55:08,820
Commentate over it.

8271
04:55:09,120 --> 04:55:11,040
Oh wait, Mace got a pick.

8272
04:55:11,400 --> 04:55:13,420
Wait, Mace, they play Thing.

8273
04:55:13,640 --> 04:55:15,080
They're playing Thing and...

8274
04:55:16,180 --> 04:55:18,400
I think Coney's a better Thing player though.

8275
04:55:18,680 --> 04:55:19,720
So I'm not.

8276
04:55:20,200 --> 04:55:23,780
Have they learned how to play against this team?

8277
04:55:24,100 --> 04:55:25,240
Wait, they're running Loki?

8278
04:55:26,080 --> 04:55:26,920
That's interesting.

8279
04:55:31,570 --> 04:55:32,610
Oh, wait.

8280
04:55:35,530 --> 04:55:36,050
Wait.

8281
04:55:36,950 --> 04:55:39,330
I don't know if they're bad at domination though.

8282
04:55:39,710 --> 04:55:40,750
They could just be like...

8283
04:55:40,750 --> 04:55:42,590
Cause I know their last...

8284
04:55:42,590 --> 04:55:44,410
Oh my god, he already has ult.

8285
04:55:44,450 --> 04:55:45,050
That's crazy.

8286
04:55:48,550 --> 04:55:49,370
That's crazy.

8287
04:55:49,530 --> 04:55:51,070
He already got the Starlord ult.

8288
04:55:56,210 --> 04:55:57,250
I know...

8289
04:55:57,990 --> 04:56:00,270
I know Coney's a better Thing player.

8290
04:56:00,270 --> 04:56:02,050
The thing is...

8291
04:56:04,030 --> 04:56:05,610
Joe... I think that's Joe, right?

8292
04:56:05,710 --> 04:56:09,710
Joe has been only playing Groot for the majority of the game.

8293
04:56:10,190 --> 04:56:11,690
So if we put...

8294
04:56:11,690 --> 04:56:13,050
He's not gonna be like...

8295
04:56:13,050 --> 04:56:14,750
He's not gonna be like...

8296
04:56:16,290 --> 04:56:18,470
He's not gonna be comfortable on the character.

8297
04:56:19,550 --> 04:56:21,750
So I know for sure that...

8298
04:56:21,750 --> 04:56:24,410
Since Coney's been playing it this entire tournament, it'll be fine.

8299
04:56:26,930 --> 04:56:27,370
Yeah.

8300
04:56:28,250 --> 04:56:29,970
I'm glad my IGL has been good too.

8301
04:56:30,870 --> 04:56:31,830
During tournament.

8302
04:56:33,610 --> 04:56:35,290
Especially when I have to pick up the slack.

8303
04:56:35,470 --> 04:56:36,710
Now that...

8304
04:56:37,050 --> 04:56:39,170
Gomez is like literally dying right now.

8305
04:56:41,050 --> 04:56:41,530
Like...

8306
04:56:42,830 --> 04:56:43,310
Yeah.

8307
04:56:44,070 --> 04:56:46,670
Gomez is like dying so I have to pick up the IGL.

8308
04:56:47,990 --> 04:56:48,810
How's my voice?

8309
04:56:49,010 --> 04:56:50,410
Not the best right now.

8310
04:56:50,510 --> 04:56:51,750
It's not like painful or anything.

8311
04:56:51,930 --> 04:56:54,130
It's just like, you know...

8312
04:56:56,570 --> 04:56:58,970
It's just like...

8313
04:57:00,270 --> 04:57:02,390
You know, I sound like I'm about... I'm gonna die.

8314
04:57:04,270 --> 04:57:04,750
Like...

8315
04:57:05,110 --> 04:57:07,130
But like, my throat feels...

8316
04:57:07,130 --> 04:57:09,710
Like, I feel okay, but I know like...

8317
04:57:09,710 --> 04:57:10,830
My throat is not...

8318
04:57:10,830 --> 04:57:11,610
Not okay.

8319
04:57:13,390 --> 04:57:15,130
Yeah, that Stray Angel was...

8320
04:57:15,130 --> 04:57:15,450
Yeah.

8321
04:57:16,690 --> 04:57:18,890
That Stray Angel was a little special.

8322
04:57:19,730 --> 04:57:21,130
I don't know why they're playing Wolverine.

8323
04:57:21,190 --> 04:57:22,330
The Wolverine has no value.

8324
04:57:24,170 --> 04:57:25,670
Their Wolverine has actually no...

8325
04:57:25,670 --> 04:57:26,890
Wait, what were their ban lines?

8326
04:57:28,130 --> 04:57:29,350
I'll see their ban lines later.

8327
04:57:30,270 --> 04:57:31,270
I don't know what their ban line was.

8328
04:57:32,150 --> 04:57:35,450
So like... Cause like, Rixie has played against Mace's team twice already.

8329
04:57:36,330 --> 04:57:36,830
So...

8330
04:57:37,870 --> 04:57:39,910
They know the ban line for Mace's team.

8331
04:57:40,110 --> 04:57:41,270
So I'm curious...

8332
04:57:42,030 --> 04:57:43,390
What the ban line is.

8333
04:57:45,830 --> 04:57:47,070
No, I feel like...

8334
04:57:47,070 --> 04:57:48,930
I feel like the Wolverine has no value.

8335
04:57:51,010 --> 04:57:53,530
The Wolverine actually has no value for this team.

8336
04:57:56,990 --> 04:57:57,490
Oh...

8337
04:57:57,490 --> 04:57:59,150
That's a huge Stray Angel.

8338
04:58:02,930 --> 04:58:04,230
One of the bans was Bucky.

8339
04:58:05,750 --> 04:58:06,710
I mean...

8340
04:58:07,310 --> 04:58:08,790
This team has Bucky one trick.

8341
04:58:09,470 --> 04:58:11,610
Like, we knew instantly that...

8342
04:58:11,610 --> 04:58:15,510
The moment we got rid of their Bucky, we started winning against this team.

8343
04:58:20,010 --> 04:58:20,370
Yeah.

8344
04:58:26,670 --> 04:58:27,530
Okay, yep.

8345
04:58:28,710 --> 04:58:29,110
Okay.

8346
04:58:29,590 --> 04:58:31,410
Yeah, Rixie's team might win this.

8347
04:58:35,730 --> 04:58:36,210
Uh...

8348
04:58:36,210 --> 04:58:37,170
Mag and Groot.

8349
04:58:37,250 --> 04:58:38,010
I mean, that makes sense.

8350
04:58:38,170 --> 04:58:40,550
We were gonna ban Groot against Mace's team.

8351
04:58:41,030 --> 04:58:42,030
But we talked about it.

8352
04:58:42,310 --> 04:58:44,310
And we were just gonna ban Groot on Mace's team.

8353
04:58:44,550 --> 04:58:45,370
And then...

8354
04:58:46,150 --> 04:58:47,530
And then, like...

8355
04:58:47,530 --> 04:58:49,710
The second ban would be like whatever...

8356
04:58:49,710 --> 04:58:52,230
Would follow...

8357
04:58:52,230 --> 04:58:54,230
Well, Rixie is like their Gomez.

8358
04:58:54,830 --> 04:58:57,710
Rixie's like a one above all Star Lord player in rank.

8359
04:58:58,910 --> 04:58:59,430
Uh...

8360
04:58:59,430 --> 04:59:01,070
I wanna see what their ban line was.

8361
04:59:02,570 --> 04:59:03,490
What was their ban line?

8362
04:59:04,130 --> 04:59:07,070
What was Mace's ban line against Rixie?

8363
04:59:12,840 --> 04:59:14,360
Does anyone see it?

8364
04:59:17,000 --> 04:59:17,520
Uh...

8365
04:59:17,520 --> 04:59:18,620
Bucky and Cloak.

8366
04:59:18,720 --> 04:59:19,060
Okay.

8367
04:59:19,780 --> 04:59:20,300
Cloak?

8368
04:59:20,380 --> 04:59:21,080
That's interesting.

8369
04:59:21,300 --> 04:59:22,740
I would just fucking ban two.

8370
04:59:23,520 --> 04:59:25,120
I don't know why I would ban Cloak.

8371
04:59:26,860 --> 04:59:28,240
I'm also one above all.

8372
04:59:28,300 --> 04:59:29,380
Yeah, but I'm a support player.

8373
04:59:30,400 --> 04:59:33,300
My impact has less of an impact versus a DPS player.

8374
04:59:36,040 --> 04:59:40,540
I don't have like that big of an impact versus a DPS.

8375
04:59:41,760 --> 04:59:45,840
I think solo support queue is like one of the hardest queues in rank.

8376
04:59:47,760 --> 04:59:52,460
It's like in Marble Rivals, you can only enable your team as a support player.

8377
04:59:53,140 --> 04:59:53,730
Um, as like...

8378
04:59:54,560 --> 04:59:56,650
You know, you only enable your team like...

8379
04:59:58,520 --> 05:00:00,900
As much as you can with what you have.

8380
05:00:02,520 --> 05:00:03,980
And Mace is like, yeah.

8381
05:00:04,240 --> 05:00:06,860
Mace is a one above all tank player.

8382
05:00:09,890 --> 05:00:16,590
They're like... They have like a really strong... They have a strong DPS lineup too, like Rixie's team.

8383
05:00:17,270 --> 05:00:17,590
Uh...

8384
05:00:17,910 --> 05:00:22,770
Cause the thing is, their Eternity player...

8385
05:00:22,770 --> 05:00:25,230
Um, they put their weaker players on support.

8386
05:00:26,370 --> 05:00:30,950
So, their support line is the lower ranked players.

8387
05:00:33,770 --> 05:00:37,770
While it's like me and Gomez are like DPS and support.

8388
05:00:38,610 --> 05:00:42,750
I'm just trying to enable Gomez to do as much as he can with what I have, with like Luna.

8389
05:00:43,810 --> 05:00:47,990
And my position in like trying to make sure I stay alive so my team can live.

8390
05:00:51,650 --> 05:00:54,170
Maybe... I hope they... Maybe it'll be cool if they ban Adam.

8391
05:00:54,330 --> 05:00:55,410
That gives us a free ban.

8392
05:00:56,710 --> 05:00:59,050
Like, I'm a better Luna than an Adam player.

8393
05:00:59,390 --> 05:01:02,890
But if they just ban Luna and Adam, then they're just... They're actually throwing.

8394
05:01:04,470 --> 05:01:06,490
They're throwing if they ban Adam Luna.

8395
05:01:07,890 --> 05:01:08,690
Because, um...

8396
05:01:10,270 --> 05:01:14,030
Because that leaves our whole team to play what they're comfortable with.

8397
05:01:22,140 --> 05:01:26,100
Oh, they're running... Oh, they're running Thora now.

8398
05:01:28,040 --> 05:01:28,920
Adam needs a rework?

8399
05:01:29,200 --> 05:01:30,080
Adam's so strong.

8400
05:01:31,080 --> 05:01:31,760
Right now.

8401
05:01:32,520 --> 05:01:33,600
He's really strong.

8402
05:01:34,060 --> 05:01:37,000
I don't know if you guys know, like, Gilbert Noodle or whatever the fuck...

8403
05:01:37,000 --> 05:01:38,620
Gilbert Noodle.

8404
05:01:39,180 --> 05:01:44,440
But like, he was like the last remaining Adam player last season when Adam wasn't meta.

8405
05:01:44,440 --> 05:01:47,560
And then people were like, oh no, Gilbert.

8406
05:01:47,700 --> 05:01:49,640
We got Gilbert because he's an Adam.

8407
05:01:49,840 --> 05:01:52,800
But this season, he's like top 10 now.

8408
05:01:55,020 --> 05:02:00,040
People would avoid Gilbert because, like, we're like, why are you playing Adam last season?

8409
05:02:00,340 --> 05:02:01,800
And now he's top 10.

8410
05:02:01,920 --> 05:02:03,560
Or he... I saw him in top 10.

8411
05:02:04,300 --> 05:02:05,620
Because of the Adam buffs.

8412
05:02:06,400 --> 05:02:08,040
It's like, oh no, it's Gilbert.

8413
05:02:08,980 --> 05:02:11,700
And the thing is, Gilbert can play a really good Wolverine too.

8414
05:02:12,060 --> 05:02:12,720
That's crazy.

8415
05:02:12,900 --> 05:02:13,160
Yeah.

8416
05:02:13,160 --> 05:02:14,360
That's crazy.

8417
05:02:14,460 --> 05:02:16,260
I remember fucking avoiding him last season.

8418
05:02:17,910 --> 05:02:24,440
I would avoid him last season because I didn't want a fucking Adam player last season because it wasn't meta.

8419
05:02:24,580 --> 05:02:26,380
I was like, can you please at least go Cloak?

8420
05:02:28,080 --> 05:02:28,500
Yeah.

8421
05:02:30,020 --> 05:02:35,440
He was literally the last Adam one trick in the fucking game in Eternity.

8422
05:02:37,060 --> 05:02:40,120
And now, like, he's like, who's laughing now?

8423
05:02:42,000 --> 05:02:44,220
Look who's laughing now.

8424
05:02:52,000 --> 05:02:53,520
No, I'm a meta slave.

8425
05:02:53,680 --> 05:02:55,140
I've always been a meta slave.

8426
05:02:58,060 --> 05:03:05,140
I mean, even Kurova, who's like, quote unquote, the number one Adam in NA, didn't even fucking ditch Adam for Sue.

8427
05:03:05,660 --> 05:03:11,940
Like, it was like the fucking number one Adam in NA.

8428
05:03:12,040 --> 05:03:15,100
And even he fucking stopped playing Adam last season.

8429
05:03:15,420 --> 05:03:17,460
All he did was play fucking Sue.

8430
05:03:24,860 --> 05:03:25,380
Yeah.

8431
05:03:25,380 --> 05:03:27,240
I mean, I just play characters.

8432
05:03:27,280 --> 05:03:32,300
I don't care about like, I don't care about like, oh, I like playing this character more.

8433
05:03:32,400 --> 05:03:36,180
I just care about gaining points because it makes me happy.

8434
05:03:38,080 --> 05:03:44,140
You know, I just, I just wanna, I just wanna be high ranked.

8435
05:03:44,360 --> 05:03:44,940
That's it.

8436
05:03:47,500 --> 05:03:49,620
I just like being a meta slave.

8437
05:03:52,810 --> 05:03:55,570
Oh, that was a sick E to the health pack.

8438
05:03:55,770 --> 05:03:57,170
That is so smart.

8439
05:03:57,290 --> 05:04:00,110
I can never be a DPS player, like, in a hero shooter.

8440
05:04:00,650 --> 05:04:01,850
That is so smart.

8441
05:04:01,970 --> 05:04:03,590
The E to a health pack.

8442
05:04:04,070 --> 05:04:06,390
Like, that is actually really smart.

8443
05:04:07,790 --> 05:04:15,650
I remember, like, I was watching a stream, a DPS player stream, and when you're a support, you don't explore the map, you know?

8444
05:04:18,590 --> 05:04:26,570
So, like, when you're, when you're, like, when you're, like, a support player, you're usually just, like, you know, with your full team.

8445
05:04:26,910 --> 05:04:30,890
But DPS players have to, like, have to play around the entire map to their advantage.

8446
05:04:31,310 --> 05:04:37,630
So, like, I remember I was just, like, I would be, like, I watched this person's stream and I was like, where the fuck is he?

8447
05:04:39,330 --> 05:04:43,070
I was like, this, I was like, where is this in the map?

8448
05:04:43,170 --> 05:04:44,170
This existed?

8449
05:04:44,170 --> 05:04:47,570
So, there's, like, a place on, what was it?

8450
05:04:47,770 --> 05:04:49,550
The low-key map.

8451
05:04:49,690 --> 05:04:51,290
That's the low-key map with the cart.

8452
05:04:51,850 --> 05:04:56,690
And, like, at the spawn area, if you go right side, there's, like, a whole new area there.

8453
05:04:56,830 --> 05:04:58,930
And I didn't know it existed.

8454
05:04:59,050 --> 05:05:00,730
I was like, where is this person?

8455
05:05:01,230 --> 05:05:06,010
I was like, where are they?

8456
05:05:06,450 --> 05:05:09,570
There's so many places in the map that I never knew existed.

8457
05:05:11,730 --> 05:05:14,730
Like, I didn't know it was a real thing.

8458
05:05:22,550 --> 05:05:23,550
Why is Gomez dying?

8459
05:05:23,830 --> 05:05:25,090
He ate bad eggs, we think.

8460
05:05:25,130 --> 05:05:26,210
We think he ate bad eggs.

8461
05:05:26,510 --> 05:05:30,930
You know, if the tournament didn't get pushed 30 minutes, he would have not eaten and things would have been okay.

8462
05:05:37,470 --> 05:05:37,870
Yeah.

8463
05:05:39,570 --> 05:05:43,550
So, like, we hope that, you know, he doesn't die.

8464
05:05:43,550 --> 05:05:49,650
It's 30 to... Okay, Grand Finals is best of 5, so we have to win 3 matches.

8465
05:05:51,010 --> 05:05:51,830
That's scary.

8466
05:05:52,070 --> 05:05:53,690
3 matches is a lot.

8467
05:05:56,350 --> 05:05:56,870
Wait,

8468
05:06:03,890 --> 05:06:05,590
did they ban Luna, right?

8469
05:06:06,630 --> 05:06:08,230
Did they try to ban me out?

8470
05:06:09,230 --> 05:06:10,090
Oh, they did!

8471
05:06:11,970 --> 05:06:12,950
They did.

8472
05:06:13,270 --> 05:06:13,910
Oh my gosh.

8473
05:06:13,970 --> 05:06:14,950
Okay, that's funny.

8474
05:06:15,670 --> 05:06:20,870
They banned me, they tried to lock me out, and then I went at them.

8475
05:06:21,090 --> 05:06:22,930
And they're like, just looking at them.

8476
05:06:24,750 --> 05:06:27,470
I don't even remember getting target banned, not gonna lie.

8477
05:06:27,890 --> 05:06:29,390
All these games blurred together.

8478
05:06:29,390 --> 05:06:29,750
Okay.

8479
05:06:30,910 --> 05:06:34,610
I explained all the shliz to Beto.

8480
05:06:34,690 --> 05:06:35,930
Thank you for the super chat, Winter.

8481
05:06:36,070 --> 05:06:36,870
Thank you, thank you.

8482
05:06:36,970 --> 05:06:37,650
I explained what?

8483
05:06:40,730 --> 05:06:41,710
We have an advantage?

8484
05:06:41,910 --> 05:06:42,810
I don't know, actually.

8485
05:06:42,970 --> 05:06:45,530
I don't know if they're doing, like, actual pro tournament.

8486
05:06:48,550 --> 05:06:49,770
I don't know if they...

8487
05:06:49,770 --> 05:06:52,430
Because, like, okay, if we're in the winner's bracket, we get a reset.

8488
05:06:52,650 --> 05:06:53,450
I can say...

8489
05:06:53,450 --> 05:06:53,730
Okay.

8490
05:06:54,350 --> 05:06:56,910
Is this, like, real tournament?

8491
05:06:57,350 --> 05:06:58,730
Real pro tournament format?

8492
05:06:59,870 --> 05:07:04,010
Where if they win three, we get a reset.

8493
05:07:06,350 --> 05:07:08,070
Since we are in winners.

8494
05:07:09,410 --> 05:07:12,410
Or is it just...

8495
05:07:12,410 --> 05:07:13,610
Regular.

8496
05:07:13,990 --> 05:07:15,850
Or is it...

8497
05:07:16,690 --> 05:07:19,570
Or is it just not like that?

8498
05:07:20,170 --> 05:07:21,030
I don't know!

8499
05:07:26,350 --> 05:07:29,950
I was like, I was like, or is it just not like that?

8500
05:07:34,500 --> 05:07:37,080
Wait, Mace's team is putting up a really good fight.

8501
05:07:37,860 --> 05:07:38,820
I get reset?

8502
05:07:39,380 --> 05:07:42,240
Is this a real tournament or do you guys suck?

8503
05:07:43,360 --> 05:07:43,880
No!

8504
05:07:44,060 --> 05:07:45,800
I didn't mean that!

8505
05:07:51,470 --> 05:07:53,810
Yeah, but I don't know if it is.

8506
05:07:54,110 --> 05:07:55,110
I don't know.

8507
05:07:56,750 --> 05:07:57,350
Toxic?

8508
05:07:57,470 --> 05:07:58,590
How is it toxic?

8509
05:07:58,950 --> 05:08:00,030
I'm just curious.

8510
05:08:01,050 --> 05:08:04,910
I mean, like, they are doing best of one for losers.

8511
05:08:07,330 --> 05:08:09,490
So, like, could be different.

8512
05:08:11,850 --> 05:08:13,770
We're definitely over time, though.

8513
05:08:16,390 --> 05:08:18,350
Okay, I'll add the...

8514
05:08:19,230 --> 05:08:19,830
Add...

8515
05:08:20,530 --> 05:08:21,130
Real...

8516
05:08:23,590 --> 05:08:25,330
I'll add the admin.

8517
05:08:26,610 --> 05:08:27,870
Yes, they said so on stream.

8518
05:08:27,990 --> 05:08:29,310
I wasn't watching stream!

8519
05:08:29,410 --> 05:08:31,030
I had my own stream to do!

8520
05:08:34,410 --> 05:08:36,050
What do you mean?

8521
05:08:37,910 --> 05:08:38,910
Yeah, ask better.

8522
05:08:39,030 --> 05:08:42,370
You want to know the format so bad, I had to put it on paint.

8523
05:08:42,630 --> 05:08:44,270
Winter, thank you for the superchat.

8524
05:08:44,370 --> 05:08:45,630
Thank you, thank you.

8525
05:08:47,650 --> 05:08:48,910
Yippee, grand finals.

8526
05:08:49,370 --> 05:08:51,110
I'm just happy we made it to grand finals.

8527
05:08:51,130 --> 05:08:52,230
I'm so happy.

8528
05:08:52,470 --> 05:08:56,470
Our practices... I'm so happy our entire team was like...

8529
05:08:56,470 --> 05:09:01,250
Our entire team worked really hard and scrimmed, you know?

8530
05:09:01,390 --> 05:09:03,950
They could have been like, no scrim, you know?

8531
05:09:04,090 --> 05:09:07,890
But, like, everybody was super open to scrimming and stuff.

8532
05:09:08,390 --> 05:09:13,070
And I feel like our... And everybody was, like, practicing and ranked together.

8533
05:09:13,510 --> 05:09:16,510
And, oh yeah, Rixie is looking bad for Rixie.

8534
05:09:16,590 --> 05:09:17,530
I might have to swap.

8535
05:09:17,530 --> 05:09:18,570
Sorry, Rixie.

8536
05:09:19,030 --> 05:09:25,490
If you lose... If they lose this round, if they lose this point, I might swap to Mace's POV.

8537
05:09:31,660 --> 05:09:32,760
Sorry, buddy.

8538
05:09:40,290 --> 05:09:42,490
Yeah, this team is great.

8539
05:09:42,830 --> 05:09:43,130
Yeah.

8540
05:09:43,590 --> 05:09:47,670
I feel bad, though, that we couldn't put Jay in for today.

8541
05:09:47,670 --> 05:09:52,130
Like, it just, like... It was just... Beto was just in his groove.

8542
05:09:52,250 --> 05:09:53,590
We just didn't want to mess up the groove.

8543
05:09:53,790 --> 05:09:56,510
And we couldn't sub out, like, things, too.

8544
05:09:58,110 --> 05:09:58,530
Alright.

8545
05:09:59,350 --> 05:10:00,770
Swapping POVs.

8546
05:10:04,190 --> 05:10:06,350
It was... It was a close game, too.

8547
05:10:06,450 --> 05:10:07,670
These match... Them...

8548
05:10:09,150 --> 05:10:10,670
We'll see how...

8549
05:10:14,910 --> 05:10:16,390
We'll see, like...

8550
05:10:17,010 --> 05:10:19,970
I don't know if it's because their team is good at domination.

8551
05:10:20,210 --> 05:10:21,030
That's the thing.

8552
05:10:23,210 --> 05:10:24,170
That's the thing.

8553
05:10:24,370 --> 05:10:26,110
Their team might just be good at domination.

8554
05:10:27,610 --> 05:10:30,590
But, like, Mace is doing so much on Strange, though.

8555
05:10:34,250 --> 05:10:38,630
I'm watching Mace's POV right now, just to research.

8556
05:10:39,450 --> 05:10:41,370
But what ban line did they do, then?

8557
05:10:42,010 --> 05:10:44,070
What was Rixie's ban line against Mace?

8558
05:10:44,750 --> 05:10:45,790
Mace's team chat?

8559
05:10:49,130 --> 05:10:50,310
I'll write this down.

8560
05:10:50,510 --> 05:10:51,610
I'll write it down for us.

8561
05:10:52,610 --> 05:10:53,790
Mace ban line.

8562
05:10:54,710 --> 05:10:55,770
What was their ban line?

8563
05:11:02,190 --> 05:11:03,490
If anybody knows.

8564
05:11:08,000 --> 05:11:09,720
Just so I can write it down for my team.

8565
05:11:09,780 --> 05:11:12,100
Because we didn't research Mace's team a lot.

8566
05:11:12,180 --> 05:11:13,420
We didn't research it too much.

8567
05:11:14,100 --> 05:11:14,700
Bucky and Cloak.

8568
05:11:14,780 --> 05:11:18,560
No, like, when they... What did they ban against him?

8569
05:11:19,420 --> 05:11:20,380
They banned Groot.

8570
05:11:21,280 --> 05:11:22,380
They banned Groot.

8571
05:11:22,480 --> 05:11:23,240
Mace ban line.

8572
05:11:24,120 --> 05:11:24,900
Groot.

8573
05:11:25,680 --> 05:11:26,800
And Mag.

8574
05:11:27,220 --> 05:11:27,740
Okay.

8575
05:11:30,000 --> 05:11:31,600
People banned...

8576
05:11:32,040 --> 05:11:36,240
People banned Groot and Mag against Mace's team.

8577
05:11:36,380 --> 05:11:36,640
Okay.

8578
05:11:37,240 --> 05:11:38,100
I'll write that down.

8579
05:11:43,390 --> 05:11:44,190
Okay.

8580
05:11:44,630 --> 05:11:45,830
We'll see how this goes.

8581
05:11:46,610 --> 05:11:47,710
I'm not listening to it.

8582
05:11:47,770 --> 05:11:49,290
I'm swapping POVs.

8583
05:11:51,450 --> 05:11:56,230
I'll give... If I have to, I'll give the Fleshtuber the view.

8584
05:12:00,890 --> 05:12:02,550
He lost my view now.

8585
05:12:02,990 --> 05:12:03,750
You know what?

8586
05:12:04,190 --> 05:12:05,270
Mace lost my view.

8587
05:12:05,370 --> 05:12:06,470
I'm not watching him now.

8588
05:12:06,870 --> 05:12:08,510
He did that to himself.

8589
05:12:16,130 --> 05:12:16,710
Actually...

8590
05:12:16,710 --> 05:12:19,950
There's like so... A lot of their teams are streaming it.

8591
05:12:23,470 --> 05:12:24,050
Yeah.

8592
05:12:24,430 --> 05:12:25,670
He lost my view.

8593
05:12:26,130 --> 05:12:26,910
I got filtered.

8594
05:12:27,510 --> 05:12:29,410
It was muted and I still got filtered.

8595
05:12:29,630 --> 05:12:31,370
Because he put it on the screen.

8596
05:12:32,210 --> 05:12:32,690
Hahaha.

8597
05:12:34,650 --> 05:12:38,190
He put it on his... Like he put the text on his screen and I got filtered.

8598
05:12:38,430 --> 05:12:38,890
I'm out.

8599
05:12:44,610 --> 05:12:45,090
Okay.

8600
05:12:45,270 --> 05:12:45,490
Yeah.

8601
05:12:45,570 --> 05:12:46,150
We get reset.

8602
05:12:46,370 --> 05:12:50,490
If we lose the best of five, we get the reset.

8603
05:12:50,730 --> 05:12:51,350
Because we're winners.

8604
05:12:51,650 --> 05:12:51,890
Okay.

8605
05:12:51,990 --> 05:12:52,450
That's cool.

8606
05:12:57,480 --> 05:12:59,880
So as long... So we have like two chances.

8607
05:13:03,590 --> 05:13:04,070
Okay.

8608
05:13:07,930 --> 05:13:08,730
That's good.

8609
05:13:09,610 --> 05:13:10,310
Oh my god.

8610
05:13:10,410 --> 05:13:11,670
This is intense though.

8611
05:13:14,350 --> 05:13:15,310
Wow.

8612
05:13:15,710 --> 05:13:16,670
Wow.

8613
05:13:30,010 --> 05:13:30,970
Oh.

8614
05:13:31,950 --> 05:13:34,390
I'm just happy we got so far.

8615
05:13:34,730 --> 05:13:35,030
Yay.

8616
05:13:35,690 --> 05:13:36,730
I'm so happy.

8617
05:13:37,670 --> 05:13:38,490
Guys.

8618
05:13:39,770 --> 05:13:41,210
I'm so happy.

8619
05:13:41,470 --> 05:13:42,590
I took this very seriously.

8620
05:13:45,770 --> 05:13:46,730
Yeah.

8621
05:13:47,510 --> 05:13:48,070
Yeah.

8622
05:13:49,410 --> 05:13:49,970
Yeah.

8623
05:13:50,790 --> 05:13:54,170
I'm just really happy, guys, that we did really well.

8624
05:13:54,290 --> 05:13:55,930
Because no matter what, we're either first or second.

8625
05:13:56,230 --> 05:13:57,710
And I'm okay with that.

8626
05:13:59,430 --> 05:14:01,470
It was a very rough start.

8627
05:14:01,630 --> 05:14:03,650
I honestly, I was so worried in the beginning.

8628
05:14:04,710 --> 05:14:07,870
Because of how rough our first game was today.

8629
05:14:09,070 --> 05:14:11,150
But everything went okay.

8630
05:14:11,390 --> 05:14:12,330
Everything went okay.

8631
05:14:12,530 --> 05:14:13,430
I'm so happy.

8632
05:14:14,370 --> 05:14:18,630
I remember I was so scared.

8633
05:14:18,830 --> 05:14:20,610
I was so scared going in.

8634
05:14:21,910 --> 05:14:22,490
And everything.

8635
05:14:25,130 --> 05:14:25,510
Yeah.

8636
05:14:25,610 --> 05:14:26,610
And I love my team.

8637
05:14:27,170 --> 05:14:28,830
My team is so fun to play with.

8638
05:14:29,430 --> 05:14:30,330
That's the best part.

8639
05:14:30,450 --> 05:14:36,410
The fact that we all have really good synergy with each other.

8640
05:14:38,190 --> 05:14:40,970
We all have really good synergy with each other.

8641
05:14:41,210 --> 05:14:46,250
And everyone is doing really well.

8642
05:14:47,490 --> 05:14:47,870
Yeah.

8643
05:14:48,130 --> 05:14:49,670
I've been super chill.

8644
05:14:49,990 --> 05:14:50,870
Good energy.

8645
05:14:51,950 --> 05:14:53,810
And I made that team.

8646
05:14:54,230 --> 05:14:55,590
I made that team.

8647
05:14:59,110 --> 05:14:59,910
Yeah.

8648
05:15:00,750 --> 05:15:04,210
We're top two out of 100 plus teams.

8649
05:15:04,450 --> 05:15:05,310
And everything.

8650
05:15:08,690 --> 05:15:09,370
Yeah.

8651
05:15:09,510 --> 05:15:11,150
The vibes have been really good too.

8652
05:15:12,070 --> 05:15:12,630
Sorry.

8653
05:15:12,710 --> 05:15:14,110
I'm getting sentimental and mushy.

8654
05:15:14,890 --> 05:15:24,730
But I'm just really happy that we're doing so well amongst 100 plus teams.

8655
05:15:32,000 --> 05:15:32,260
Yeah.

8656
05:15:32,300 --> 05:15:34,620
I just hope Gomez doesn't fucking die.

8657
05:15:40,080 --> 05:15:42,740
Like, that's the harder part.

8658
05:15:43,020 --> 05:15:46,180
Like, right before the grand finals.

8659
05:15:46,460 --> 05:15:50,160
Like, I just hope he's alive by then.

8660
05:15:51,760 --> 05:15:53,260
Wait, did he throw up?

8661
05:15:55,040 --> 05:15:57,700
Wait, did he actually throw up?

8662
05:15:57,780 --> 05:15:59,080
Did he got over his phobia?

8663
05:16:01,600 --> 05:16:07,460
Bro, he once told me he would try and stop.

8664
05:16:07,560 --> 05:16:08,320
Oh, no, he didn't.

8665
05:16:08,440 --> 05:16:08,600
Okay.

8666
05:16:09,100 --> 05:16:09,800
Oh, he did?

8667
05:16:10,960 --> 05:16:11,880
Oh, shit.

8668
05:16:12,140 --> 05:16:12,420
Okay.

8669
05:16:12,600 --> 05:16:12,820
Okay.

8670
05:16:12,900 --> 05:16:18,440
Because he once told me the story about that thing where he had a phobia about throwing up.

8671
05:16:18,920 --> 05:16:23,020
And he told me, he was like, I would rather... Okay, it's so fucking disgusting.

8672
05:16:26,280 --> 05:16:30,780
It was he who died for our doves.

8673
05:16:34,240 --> 05:16:37,800
And you would like, you know, try to stop it.

8674
05:16:37,860 --> 05:16:40,400
And you know what it means.

8675
05:16:41,320 --> 05:16:42,740
Hey, chat told me you threw up.

8676
05:16:42,820 --> 05:16:43,680
Did you actually do it?

8677
05:16:43,900 --> 05:16:44,720
Oh, no.

8678
05:16:44,920 --> 05:16:45,540
Wait, who told you?

8679
05:16:46,240 --> 05:16:46,640
Wait, you didn't?

8680
05:16:46,760 --> 05:16:47,300
They lied?

8681
05:16:47,400 --> 05:16:47,780
Oh, my God.

8682
05:16:47,800 --> 05:16:49,180
My chat's spreading misinformation too.

8683
05:16:50,460 --> 05:16:51,300
Oh, my God.

8684
05:16:51,300 --> 05:16:52,300
Wait, are you okay?

8685
05:16:53,160 --> 05:16:53,680
No, I'm good.

8686
05:16:53,780 --> 05:16:54,080
I'm good.

8687
05:16:54,440 --> 05:16:57,020
I'm all good now.

8688
05:16:57,300 --> 05:16:58,220
Wait, what did you do?

8689
05:16:59,420 --> 05:17:00,240
I'm just water viewing.

8690
05:17:01,060 --> 05:17:03,000
Wait, so your stomach is just okay?

8691
05:17:04,400 --> 05:17:06,440
I took Pepto and Alka-Seltzer.

8692
05:17:06,600 --> 05:17:08,520
My stomach feels pretty good right now.

8693
05:17:08,840 --> 05:17:09,860
Okay, don't jinx yourself.

8694
05:17:10,780 --> 05:17:11,780
Yeah, I was surprised.

8695
05:17:12,120 --> 05:17:14,200
I was like, my chat was telling me you threw up.

8696
05:17:14,280 --> 05:17:16,240
And I was like, this man would rather swallow than throw up.

8697
05:17:16,300 --> 05:17:16,860
I don't think.

8698
05:17:18,060 --> 05:17:19,900
Yeah, I would never throw up.

8699
05:17:19,900 --> 05:17:21,740
Yeah, I was like, there's no way.

8700
05:17:21,940 --> 05:17:22,900
I was like...

8701
05:17:23,820 --> 05:17:25,500
You would stop and stuff.

8702
05:17:25,560 --> 05:17:26,640
I was so surprised.

8703
05:17:27,920 --> 05:17:32,660
No, if I can't hold it in, it comes out.

8704
05:17:33,360 --> 05:17:36,700
But you would try very hard to keep it in.

8705
05:17:36,940 --> 05:17:37,560
I would not.

8706
05:17:39,340 --> 05:17:41,160
He is not a quitter.

8707
05:17:41,920 --> 05:17:43,520
Go, Ms. Swallows!

8708
05:17:45,460 --> 05:17:46,660
Okay, I'm muting.

8709
05:17:46,660 --> 05:17:50,980
Oh, he muted himself.

8710
05:17:55,780 --> 05:17:57,860
I'm no fucking swallower.

8711
05:17:58,020 --> 05:17:58,460
Hello?

8712
05:17:59,240 --> 05:18:00,640
Like, what the fuck?

8713
05:18:01,580 --> 05:18:03,260
No, I refuse.

8714
05:18:03,380 --> 05:18:04,480
Okay, I won't do that, though.

8715
05:18:04,600 --> 05:18:05,120
I won't do that.

8716
05:18:08,440 --> 05:18:10,660
He's pulling him out of CDC.

8717
05:18:13,220 --> 05:18:14,860
He's not a quitter.

8718
05:18:29,920 --> 05:18:31,120
He's not a quitter.

8719
05:18:31,120 --> 05:18:31,780
That's crazy.

8720
05:18:33,700 --> 05:18:37,220
I have his chat open.

8721
05:18:37,660 --> 05:18:39,520
No shame in swallowing.

8722
05:18:40,900 --> 05:18:42,600
Spitters are quitters.

8723
05:18:43,180 --> 05:18:46,460
Sometimes I love Twitch chat.

8724
05:18:54,110 --> 05:18:58,190
Oh my god, I hope Gomez will be okay.

8725
05:18:58,690 --> 05:19:00,570
We need three games.

8726
05:19:00,870 --> 05:19:01,610
Three games.

8727
05:19:02,350 --> 05:19:04,710
Three games and we'll all be free.

8728
05:19:11,150 --> 05:19:19,850
I'm just like, I'm still, I'm like, I don't know, like, I think, like, now, like, when I'm in the game, when I'm in the game, like, I'm in the zone.

8729
05:19:20,270 --> 05:19:24,150
Like, I'm not as nervous anymore, but...

8730
05:19:25,550 --> 05:19:28,190
I'm still like...

8731
05:19:29,250 --> 05:19:31,010
I'm still like...

8732
05:19:34,310 --> 05:19:35,110
I'm glad.

8733
05:19:35,210 --> 05:19:36,370
I'm glad I made an awesome team.

8734
05:19:37,670 --> 05:19:42,890
I'm glad, like, everybody contributed a lot to the team going in.

8735
05:19:45,390 --> 05:19:47,970
And everybody had their own character arc, too.

8736
05:19:49,570 --> 05:19:52,670
Yeah, everyone had, like, their winning play.

8737
05:19:54,850 --> 05:19:59,210
Had their, like, like, moment to shine.

8738
05:19:59,210 --> 05:20:06,870
I think every, yeah, every member on our team had, like, a clippable moment that, like, saved the game.

8739
05:20:08,710 --> 05:20:14,630
And let it, like, you know, like, you know, Limu's ults and stuff, her support ults and her keeping me alive.

8740
05:20:15,110 --> 05:20:18,050
And then, you know, Coney's thing, all...

8741
05:20:18,050 --> 05:20:21,170
Bettle's fucking strange ults fucking did so much.

8742
05:20:21,950 --> 05:20:25,370
Gomez just doing the fuck he does as a pro player, like...

8743
05:20:25,370 --> 05:20:26,450
Gomez existing.

8744
05:20:31,470 --> 05:20:36,790
Shoto's, like, support at Namor and his gameplay as Namor and Bucky, too.

8745
05:20:37,350 --> 05:20:39,950
And Jay on, like, strange as well.

8746
05:20:40,350 --> 05:20:41,970
When we put him in on strange.

8747
05:20:45,050 --> 05:20:46,990
And Jay's moral support.

8748
05:20:48,490 --> 05:20:48,750
Yeah.

8749
05:20:50,950 --> 05:20:58,370
Yeah, like, Limu's link, soul link there actually saved us for that game.

8750
05:20:59,090 --> 05:21:00,010
I'm so glad.

8751
05:21:00,090 --> 05:21:06,010
Or we would have been loser bracket, too, if Limu didn't do that soul link to save me, so I could have my Q up.

8752
05:21:13,650 --> 05:21:16,070
The game haven't started yet, by the way.

8753
05:21:16,310 --> 05:21:18,410
They're still...

8754
05:21:18,410 --> 05:21:19,230
They're...

8755
05:21:22,730 --> 05:21:25,690
They're still... I think they're starting soon-ish.

8756
05:21:26,170 --> 05:21:28,050
I think they're about to start soon.

8757
05:21:30,650 --> 05:21:32,010
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

8758
05:21:34,050 --> 05:21:34,650
Yeah.

8759
05:21:36,690 --> 05:21:43,190
And they're all, like, you know, a lot of them were, like, Diamond players, too, because we could only have two players that were above Diamond.

8760
05:21:44,050 --> 05:21:48,710
And all, you know, within two weeks, they all climbed to Celestial from, like, just the coaching.

8761
05:21:49,130 --> 05:21:51,250
From the coaching and playing together, too.

8762
05:21:51,650 --> 05:21:53,110
So I'm really proud of my team.

8763
05:21:56,490 --> 05:21:57,550
Who's POV are you watching?

8764
05:21:57,770 --> 05:21:58,430
I don't know yet.

8765
05:21:59,510 --> 05:22:00,310
I don't know yet.

8766
05:22:01,910 --> 05:22:05,750
I'll watch some... I'm gonna watch someone on Mace's team, but I'm not gonna watch Mace.

8767
05:22:05,870 --> 05:22:06,910
He already lost me as a viewer.

8768
05:22:12,690 --> 05:22:14,430
He lost me as a viewer.

8769
05:22:22,270 --> 05:22:23,550
That's what they did.

8770
05:22:30,730 --> 05:22:31,170
Okay.

8771
05:22:32,690 --> 05:22:34,430
Okay, so they'll protect Strange.

8772
05:22:48,000 --> 05:22:49,660
Do we ban Strange, then?

8773
05:22:49,740 --> 05:22:51,040
Okay, I'll write this down.

8774
05:22:52,980 --> 05:22:53,660
Um...

8775
05:22:53,660 --> 05:22:58,460
Protect Strange, and he says Strange keeps everyone cute.

8776
05:23:08,100 --> 05:23:08,780
Okay.

8777
05:23:09,400 --> 05:23:09,980
Okay.

8778
05:23:10,840 --> 05:23:14,020
We want to ban... We want to ban Strange.

8779
05:23:14,620 --> 05:23:15,940
Thanks for the intel, Mace.

8780
05:23:21,400 --> 05:23:24,620
Thanks, Mace, for telling us your crutch.

8781
05:23:34,950 --> 05:23:37,390
Unless he's lying on stream.

8782
05:23:39,570 --> 05:23:45,290
He literally was like, they think banning Mag is a good idea, but Strange is the thing that's keeping us all together.

8783
05:23:45,750 --> 05:23:47,030
I was like, write that down!

8784
05:23:47,350 --> 05:23:47,910
Write that down!

8785
05:23:53,870 --> 05:23:54,390
Okay.

8786
05:23:56,530 --> 05:23:57,610
Ew, okay.

8787
05:23:59,990 --> 05:24:00,510
Yeah.

8788
05:24:09,150 --> 05:24:10,230
That's fine, then.

8789
05:24:10,410 --> 05:24:11,790
But then the thing is...

8790
05:24:12,170 --> 05:24:16,230
They might try and ban... I guess they'll try and ban the thing and we'll just save Starlord.

8791
05:24:16,950 --> 05:24:20,010
Yeah, we'll just try and save Starlord if they try to ban the thing.

8792
05:24:20,610 --> 05:24:23,190
And then, we have...

8793
05:24:23,190 --> 05:24:25,350
We can play Venom... We can play Venom...

8794
05:24:27,210 --> 05:24:28,010
Venom Mag.

8795
05:24:30,250 --> 05:24:30,650
Um...

8796
05:24:32,350 --> 05:24:33,270
Because it doesn't matter.

8797
05:24:33,430 --> 05:24:37,210
No matter what, they are leaving themselves vulnerable to, like, our best players.

8798
05:24:37,950 --> 05:24:41,470
Like, they're gonna... We're gonna have, like, Gomez heavily enabled, then.

8799
05:24:42,350 --> 05:24:43,490
Like, heavily pocketed.

8800
05:24:44,250 --> 05:24:49,630
And then, we can just run Mantis, Loki... We'll just run Mantis, Loki, Luna.

8801
05:24:55,230 --> 05:24:55,990
Yeah, no.

8802
05:24:56,230 --> 05:24:56,790
That's the thing.

8803
05:24:57,010 --> 05:24:58,990
But they'll always try to protect one or the other.

8804
05:24:59,170 --> 05:25:01,410
They'll always try to protect either Mag or Strange.

8805
05:25:08,650 --> 05:25:09,610
So, we'll see.

8806
05:25:10,070 --> 05:25:11,830
I mean, it'll be interesting what they protect.

8807
05:25:23,700 --> 05:25:24,220
Okay.

8808
05:25:28,020 --> 05:25:31,480
Their DPS... I'm not as scared of their...

8809
05:25:31,480 --> 05:25:34,100
Our DPS can dip their DPS, 100%.

8810
05:25:34,100 --> 05:25:35,440
I agree with that.

8811
05:25:36,360 --> 05:25:38,100
They just have, like, a really...

8812
05:25:48,500 --> 05:25:49,820
What do you mean, look at the Storm?

8813
05:25:49,900 --> 05:25:50,860
The Storm is full HP.

8814
05:25:51,580 --> 05:25:52,540
Wait, they just...

8815
05:25:54,660 --> 05:25:56,620
I'm looking at Storm right now.

8816
05:26:01,490 --> 05:26:02,970
What the fuck is this?

8817
05:26:03,050 --> 05:26:05,990
I don't know what the fuck is going on in this comp.

8818
05:26:08,670 --> 05:26:12,670
What the fuck is going... What is going on?

8819
05:26:13,410 --> 05:26:15,050
They just farm ults.

8820
05:26:15,430 --> 05:26:16,350
That's just their strat.

8821
05:26:17,290 --> 05:26:21,870
They literally farm ults and then Rocket... Rocket Punisher.

8822
05:26:23,290 --> 05:26:26,410
Okay, they run Rocket Punisher a lot, too.

8823
05:26:29,350 --> 05:26:31,870
We could Rocket Punisher.

8824
05:26:33,570 --> 05:26:34,410
Mesa...

8825
05:26:38,390 --> 05:26:40,830
Protect Strange or Mag.

8826
05:26:41,190 --> 05:26:44,430
To protect Strange or Mag, since it's the strongest.

8827
05:26:50,510 --> 05:26:52,250
Okay, and then I should write down...

8828
05:26:54,670 --> 05:26:56,830
They also try to force...

8829
05:26:57,670 --> 05:26:59,570
Force Punisher, Rocket.

8830
05:27:03,110 --> 05:27:07,170
So, they also try to force Punisher, Rocket.

8831
05:27:07,870 --> 05:27:09,530
So, we have that, too.

8832
05:27:10,630 --> 05:27:14,810
Rixie's team heavily tries to rely on...

8833
05:27:14,810 --> 05:27:19,850
What I've noticed is that Rixie's team relies on...

8834
05:27:20,970 --> 05:27:22,930
Starlord to do something.

8835
05:27:23,510 --> 05:27:29,150
And Nova, they're strange to keep everyone together, which I've noticed.

8836
05:27:29,690 --> 05:27:32,710
So, when Rixie is out, then their team collapses.

8837
05:27:39,620 --> 05:27:41,680
That's what I've noticed on Rixie's team.

8838
05:27:42,260 --> 05:27:45,200
When we shut down Rixie, their team just collapses.

8839
05:27:46,000 --> 05:27:48,600
But Nova, their Starlord is...

8840
05:27:48,600 --> 05:27:51,840
No, their Strange player is like a strange sort of one trick.

8841
05:27:52,360 --> 05:27:53,200
So, like...

8842
05:27:54,280 --> 05:27:55,680
Their Strange is their...

8843
05:27:56,100 --> 05:27:58,120
Their Strange is their Eternity player.

8844
05:27:58,340 --> 05:27:59,080
What the fuck?

8845
05:27:59,420 --> 05:28:01,300
Okay, I was like, what the fuck is the Punisher doing?

8846
05:28:05,560 --> 05:28:06,600
I'm watching...

8847
05:28:07,020 --> 05:28:09,160
I'm watching one of their players.

8848
05:28:09,960 --> 05:28:11,760
I'll just say I'm not watching Mace.

8849
05:28:12,440 --> 05:28:14,140
I'm just bouncing between POVs.

8850
05:28:20,250 --> 05:28:20,770
Uh...

8851
05:28:21,370 --> 05:28:23,270
I mean, you can watch...

8852
05:28:23,910 --> 05:28:24,890
These people are streaming.

8853
05:28:25,150 --> 05:28:30,990
It's Mace, Joe, Kiryu, and...

8854
05:28:30,990 --> 05:28:32,290
I think their entire team...

8855
05:28:32,290 --> 05:28:34,890
Actually, their entire team is streaming other than IPN, I'm pretty sure.

8856
05:28:36,510 --> 05:28:37,150
How much time?

8857
05:28:37,470 --> 05:28:38,750
They're on round 2.

8858
05:28:39,210 --> 05:28:41,290
If Rixie's team...

8859
05:28:42,290 --> 05:28:44,990
If Rixie's team wins this, they have to play another game.

8860
05:28:48,620 --> 05:28:49,700
Goodbye, Storm.

8861
05:28:52,980 --> 05:28:54,160
Goodbye, Storm.

8862
05:28:59,570 --> 05:29:00,630
Yeah, we just have...

8863
05:29:00,630 --> 05:29:02,870
We have a team that's not one tricks.

8864
05:29:03,110 --> 05:29:04,010
That's basically it.

8865
05:29:04,170 --> 05:29:05,890
We had a one trick, but they all...

8866
05:29:05,890 --> 05:29:07,630
We forced them off of their one trick.

8867
05:29:11,790 --> 05:29:13,710
No, this is...

8868
05:29:14,410 --> 05:29:15,150
It's 2.

8869
05:29:15,330 --> 05:29:16,550
Oh, we could ban 2.

8870
05:29:22,690 --> 05:29:23,370
Yeah, see?

8871
05:29:23,470 --> 05:29:26,810
The moment Rixie is out, like, their team collapses.

8872
05:29:28,330 --> 05:29:30,750
Their team collapses without...

8873
05:29:31,510 --> 05:29:32,370
Without Rixie.

8874
05:29:33,770 --> 05:29:34,370
It's like when...

8875
05:29:34,370 --> 05:29:35,910
For us, when Gomez...

8876
05:29:36,670 --> 05:29:39,230
When Gomez dies for us, we can still recover.

8877
05:29:39,930 --> 05:29:42,650
We can still recover, because we still have, like...

8878
05:29:44,370 --> 05:29:46,770
We still have, like...

8879
05:29:47,510 --> 05:29:48,030
Like...

8880
05:29:48,030 --> 05:29:48,930
We're not that scared.

8881
05:29:55,530 --> 05:29:56,550
Are they running triple support?

8882
05:29:56,610 --> 05:29:57,070
They are.

8883
05:29:59,490 --> 05:30:00,010
Okay.

8884
05:30:00,010 --> 05:30:00,190
Okay.

8885
05:30:05,610 --> 05:30:05,990
Oh.

8886
05:30:09,190 --> 05:30:09,630
Woah.

8887
05:30:10,630 --> 05:30:11,590
That was a good throw.

8888
05:30:11,950 --> 05:30:13,170
Wait, how the fuck?

8889
05:30:14,550 --> 05:30:16,670
How the fuck did he get that ult off?

8890
05:30:18,650 --> 05:30:20,150
Yeah, we play after this match.

8891
05:30:26,590 --> 05:30:28,610
Yeah, if we lose our carry, we can still...

8892
05:30:28,610 --> 05:30:31,130
If we lose their carry, we can still get...

8893
05:30:31,130 --> 05:30:33,570
We can still fight.

8894
05:30:34,010 --> 05:30:36,650
Like, the amount of times we've lost...

8895
05:30:36,650 --> 05:30:40,390
The amount of times we've lost Gomez to dumb shit...

8896
05:30:40,390 --> 05:30:41,130
But we can still...

8897
05:30:41,130 --> 05:30:41,970
We can still recover.

8898
05:30:45,390 --> 05:30:45,830
Like...

8899
05:30:47,390 --> 05:30:49,510
It's not, like, the end for us.

8900
05:30:50,610 --> 05:30:53,210
What the fuck was that eye, bro?

8901
05:30:54,150 --> 05:30:56,570
That was, like, the most predictable ult ever.

8902
05:31:00,480 --> 05:31:02,340
I think they have best of three, right?

8903
05:31:02,860 --> 05:31:05,400
Is their loser bracket best of three, chat?

8904
05:31:07,480 --> 05:31:08,680
Is it best of three, guys?

8905
05:31:08,680 --> 05:31:09,100
I can't.

8906
05:31:09,160 --> 05:31:09,580
I don't know.

8907
05:31:09,860 --> 05:31:10,820
Or is it best of five?

8908
05:31:11,200 --> 05:31:12,620
Cause ours is best of five.

8909
05:31:16,200 --> 05:31:18,360
Oh, that was their last fight, too.

8910
05:31:21,040 --> 05:31:22,080
It's best of three?

8911
05:31:22,380 --> 05:31:22,780
Okay.

8912
05:31:23,360 --> 05:31:24,520
Okay, we might play mace team.

8913
05:31:26,460 --> 05:31:27,720
We might have to play...

8914
05:31:34,880 --> 05:31:35,380
Wow.

8915
05:31:41,210 --> 05:31:41,710
Okay.

8916
05:31:52,090 --> 05:31:54,810
Alright, so our ban line might have to be...

8917
05:31:54,810 --> 05:31:56,080
Ban line may be...

8918
05:31:57,710 --> 05:31:58,210
Um...

8919
05:32:00,190 --> 05:32:00,710
Strange...

8920
05:32:01,870 --> 05:32:02,390
Strange...

8921
05:32:05,210 --> 05:32:05,730
Groot...

8922
05:32:05,730 --> 05:32:06,710
Uh...

8923
05:32:13,840 --> 05:32:14,360
Protect...

8924
05:32:14,360 --> 05:32:14,820
Alright.

8925
05:32:17,420 --> 05:32:17,940
Uh...

8926
05:32:17,940 --> 05:32:20,120
Yeah, I'd rather we get rid of Strange.

8927
05:32:24,590 --> 05:32:25,650
Wait, that's an exploit.

8928
05:32:26,070 --> 05:32:27,170
You're not allowed to do that.

8929
05:32:32,610 --> 05:32:33,630
I thought... I think...

8930
05:32:33,630 --> 05:32:35,090
He said they weren't allowed to do that.

8931
05:32:39,810 --> 05:32:41,550
Yeah, it's considered an exploit.

8932
05:32:46,390 --> 05:32:48,290
Cause you're not allowed to do that in tournament play.

8933
05:32:53,960 --> 05:32:54,700
So, as Penny...

8934
05:32:56,380 --> 05:32:57,060
As Penny...

8935
05:32:57,060 --> 05:32:57,920
I don't think they know.

8936
05:32:58,060 --> 05:32:59,860
Cause it was, like, fucking said in the...

8937
05:32:59,860 --> 05:33:01,320
There's so many posts, guys.

8938
05:33:01,680 --> 05:33:04,080
I only know because, like, sometimes I get curious.

8939
05:33:04,180 --> 05:33:05,800
And I look through, like, the forums.

8940
05:33:06,000 --> 05:33:06,740
Like, the Q...

8941
05:33:06,740 --> 05:33:08,200
Like, the Q&A thing.

8942
05:33:08,280 --> 05:33:09,660
To see if there's, like, any updates.

8943
05:33:09,680 --> 05:33:11,500
Cause sometimes they post updates in weird areas.

8944
05:33:11,900 --> 05:33:13,280
And, like, they're asking if, like...

8945
05:33:13,280 --> 05:33:14,720
They're, like, not allowed to do, like...

8946
05:33:14,720 --> 05:33:17,220
Cause, like, the Penny thing is considered an exploit.

8947
05:33:17,220 --> 05:33:18,220
Um...

8948
05:33:18,760 --> 05:33:23,040
Because you can technically throw mines as Penny.

8949
05:33:23,520 --> 05:33:25,520
To kill somebody from spawn.

8950
05:33:26,200 --> 05:33:27,490
So, like...

8951
05:33:28,240 --> 05:33:29,020
Um...

8952
05:33:29,020 --> 05:33:30,140
So, like...

8953
05:33:30,140 --> 05:33:31,380
Yeah, obviously...

8954
05:33:31,380 --> 05:33:31,960
Yuki...

8955
05:33:33,100 --> 05:33:34,520
It's not great.

8956
05:33:35,880 --> 05:33:37,360
Sometimes I ask...

8957
05:33:37,360 --> 05:33:38,340
Yeah...

8958
05:33:38,340 --> 05:33:40,760
Yeah, so you can actually die in spawn.

8959
05:33:41,520 --> 05:33:42,660
Like, you can die...

8960
05:33:42,660 --> 05:33:44,400
And then die when the match...

8961
05:33:44,400 --> 05:33:45,420
Before the match even started.

8962
05:33:46,380 --> 05:33:47,180
And then...

8963
05:33:47,180 --> 05:33:47,960
You can't even...

8964
05:33:47,960 --> 05:33:49,100
You won't even be able to, like...

8965
05:33:49,100 --> 05:33:50,120
Get back in time.

8966
05:33:53,040 --> 05:33:53,440
Yeah...

8967
05:33:57,160 --> 05:33:59,240
But, obviously, you can't do that in tournament play.

8968
05:34:16,350 --> 05:34:16,750
Okay...

8969
05:34:16,750 --> 05:34:19,190
I think they're just limited by their Bucky player, too.

8970
05:34:20,130 --> 05:34:20,530
Rixi's...

8971
05:34:20,530 --> 05:34:22,590
Rixi's team is limited by their Bucky...

8972
05:34:23,190 --> 05:34:23,590
That...

8973
05:34:23,590 --> 05:34:24,270
Bucky player.

8974
05:34:24,350 --> 05:34:25,490
Cause he can only play Storm.

8975
05:34:26,110 --> 05:34:27,970
He can only play Storm and Bucky.

8976
05:34:36,760 --> 05:34:37,720
What the fuck?

8977
05:34:38,360 --> 05:34:39,700
Did they get anybody?

8978
05:34:44,320 --> 05:34:45,800
I mean, they have 4 minutes.

8979
05:34:46,000 --> 05:34:47,240
They have 5 minutes for this.

8980
05:34:59,860 --> 05:35:00,340
No,

8981
05:35:17,070 --> 05:35:17,610
we have a...

8982
05:35:17,610 --> 05:35:18,190
We have a...

8983
05:35:19,950 --> 05:35:21,210
And we have...

8984
05:35:21,210 --> 05:35:22,110
We can have Mag, too.

8985
05:35:22,330 --> 05:35:23,890
They're, like, asking what to do with Punisher.

8986
05:35:24,370 --> 05:35:26,350
We can have Mag against their Punisher.

8987
05:35:27,030 --> 05:35:27,510
And...

8988
05:35:27,510 --> 05:35:31,310
Gomez can play a DPS character that counters Punisher hard.

8989
05:35:37,320 --> 05:35:38,900
Okay, not gonna lie...

8990
05:35:42,160 --> 05:35:46,000
Rixi's Strange has been incredibly predictable...

8991
05:35:46,600 --> 05:35:47,740
With the Strange ult.

8992
05:35:48,700 --> 05:35:49,220
Like...

8993
05:35:49,220 --> 05:35:50,740
Not gonna lie.

8994
05:35:54,210 --> 05:35:55,210
He's, like...

8995
05:35:55,210 --> 05:35:57,950
He's sort of, like, been incredibly predictable.

8996
05:36:02,860 --> 05:36:03,900
Oh, they're...

8997
05:36:03,900 --> 05:36:05,100
Storm is, like, 1.

8998
05:36:06,760 --> 05:36:08,300
Do they have an ult for that?

8999
05:36:08,400 --> 05:36:09,220
No, they...

9000
05:36:32,390 --> 05:36:32,910
Okay...

9001
05:36:32,910 --> 05:36:34,050
Okay, it's...

9002
05:36:34,050 --> 05:36:35,830
Mace's team that we're playing against.

9003
05:36:36,130 --> 05:36:37,410
I didn't think...

9004
05:36:37,410 --> 05:36:37,650
I...

9005
05:36:37,650 --> 05:36:38,550
That's surprising.

9006
05:36:39,290 --> 05:36:40,490
I'm surprised.

9007
05:36:42,050 --> 05:36:43,270
They improved a lot.

9008
05:36:48,470 --> 05:36:49,670
No, like...

9009
05:36:49,670 --> 05:36:49,970
That...

9010
05:36:49,970 --> 05:36:53,490
Rixi's Strange was doing really predictable...

9011
05:36:53,490 --> 05:36:54,730
Strange ults there.

9012
05:36:54,930 --> 05:36:57,010
Like, he literally just flies in front of them.

9013
05:36:58,650 --> 05:37:00,350
Like, 3 times in a row.

9014
05:37:00,390 --> 05:37:02,770
And it didn't work, unfortunately, for them.

9015
05:37:04,050 --> 05:37:05,110
It didn't work.

9016
05:37:26,940 --> 05:37:27,720
I'm nervous.

9017
05:37:27,780 --> 05:37:28,680
Of course, I am.

9018
05:37:29,200 --> 05:37:29,840
I am nervous.

9019
05:37:31,840 --> 05:37:32,440
Alright.

9020
05:37:32,980 --> 05:37:34,380
Did you guys watch the stream?

9021
05:37:36,000 --> 05:37:36,600
Uh...

9022
05:37:36,600 --> 05:37:36,900
Kinda.

9023
05:37:37,260 --> 05:37:37,880
Not really.

9024
05:37:38,520 --> 05:37:38,980
Mace...

9025
05:37:40,320 --> 05:37:40,920
Kinda...

9026
05:37:40,920 --> 05:37:41,960
Demolished them.

9027
05:37:42,580 --> 05:37:43,440
The thing is...

9028
05:37:43,440 --> 05:37:45,160
I was watching the stream...

9029
05:37:45,160 --> 05:37:46,840
And Mace was literally saying that, like...

9030
05:37:48,060 --> 05:37:50,940
That having Strange is keeping their team together.

9031
05:37:53,920 --> 05:37:54,360
Alright.

9032
05:37:56,280 --> 05:37:56,720
So...

9033
05:37:56,720 --> 05:37:58,820
So, I think we need to ban Strange.

9034
05:37:59,980 --> 05:38:01,340
We ban Strange first.

9035
05:38:03,020 --> 05:38:03,460
Alright.

9036
05:38:03,820 --> 05:38:05,000
No banning Bucky?

9037
05:38:05,160 --> 05:38:05,440
Oh, no.

9038
05:38:06,020 --> 05:38:06,540
No, no.

9039
05:38:06,640 --> 05:38:06,980
They're not...

9040
05:38:06,980 --> 05:38:08,720
They heavy pocket their Punisher, though.

9041
05:38:08,720 --> 05:38:09,920
The moment, like...

9042
05:38:09,920 --> 05:38:11,020
They do play Bucky, though.

9043
05:38:11,120 --> 05:38:12,860
But I don't know if it's worth it to ban.

9044
05:38:13,980 --> 05:38:15,860
Cody needs 10 minutes to finish his bounty.

9045
05:38:16,940 --> 05:38:17,520
We need to wait.

9046
05:38:19,060 --> 05:38:21,400
There's a 5-minute break in between, anyway.

9047
05:38:21,400 --> 05:38:23,400
Okay, okay.

9048
05:38:24,100 --> 05:38:24,720
So, like...

9049
05:38:24,720 --> 05:38:25,500
What I've noticed...

9050
05:38:25,500 --> 05:38:26,480
Are you okay, also, Gomez?

9051
05:38:26,560 --> 05:38:27,020
Are you okay?

9052
05:38:27,560 --> 05:38:28,560
Do you feel like...

9053
05:38:28,560 --> 05:38:28,720
Okay.

9054
05:38:29,060 --> 05:38:30,060
Like, you don't have, like...

9055
05:38:30,060 --> 05:38:31,200
Stomach issues at the moment?

9056
05:38:32,100 --> 05:38:32,480
Nah.

9057
05:38:32,820 --> 05:38:33,140
Okay.

9058
05:38:33,400 --> 05:38:33,920
I'm all...

9059
05:38:33,920 --> 05:38:34,600
I'm all right now.

9060
05:38:34,940 --> 05:38:36,520
The Pepto, it saved you.

9061
05:38:36,620 --> 05:38:36,900
Yeah!

9062
05:38:38,200 --> 05:38:40,140
I wrote down the notes while I was watching.

9063
05:38:40,280 --> 05:38:41,660
So, I think we should do Strange.

9064
05:38:41,820 --> 05:38:42,400
And then...

9065
05:38:43,360 --> 05:38:44,180
I guess Groot.

9066
05:38:44,240 --> 05:38:45,580
Because we fucking hate Groot, anyway.

9067
05:38:46,140 --> 05:38:46,520
So...

9068
05:38:48,040 --> 05:38:48,800
And then...

9069
05:38:49,560 --> 05:38:50,800
When they do that...

9070
05:38:50,800 --> 05:38:51,940
They Punisher Rocket.

9071
05:38:52,180 --> 05:38:52,740
And they just...

9072
05:38:52,740 --> 05:38:55,180
Heavily pocket their Punisher the entire time.

9073
05:38:56,220 --> 05:38:57,960
I also noticed they like to, like...

9074
05:38:58,440 --> 05:38:58,840
Do...

9075
05:38:58,840 --> 05:38:59,580
Scarlet Witch.

9076
05:38:59,780 --> 05:39:00,580
If he's mag.

9077
05:39:00,820 --> 05:39:01,340
For a bit.

9078
05:39:01,560 --> 05:39:03,220
So, he gets that...

9079
05:39:03,220 --> 05:39:04,600
Immediate damage thing.

9080
05:39:04,600 --> 05:39:05,120
Yeah, but Scarlet Witch is trash.

9081
05:39:05,120 --> 05:39:05,500
For some reason.

9082
05:39:06,220 --> 05:39:06,620
So...

9083
05:39:06,620 --> 05:39:07,320
Yeah, it's just like...

9084
05:39:07,320 --> 05:39:08,880
They stay in spawn and then they swap off of it.

9085
05:39:09,260 --> 05:39:09,660
That thing.

9086
05:39:09,860 --> 05:39:10,200
You know what I mean?

9087
05:39:10,460 --> 05:39:10,700
Yeah.

9088
05:39:11,600 --> 05:39:12,620
I don't know why.

9089
05:39:14,780 --> 05:39:15,780
They think that...

9090
05:39:15,780 --> 05:39:17,260
Kony is actually in the bathroom.

9091
05:39:17,740 --> 05:39:18,100
Or I don't know.

9092
05:39:18,140 --> 05:39:19,000
They're playing with us.

9093
05:39:20,980 --> 05:39:21,840
Okay, no, no.

9094
05:39:21,840 --> 05:39:22,500
It's all good.

9095
05:39:22,700 --> 05:39:23,740
Oh, we got 15 minutes.

9096
05:39:23,880 --> 05:39:24,880
Yeah, we got 15 minutes.

9097
05:39:25,440 --> 05:39:27,480
So, I guess our ban line would be...

9098
05:39:27,480 --> 05:39:28,760
Strange, then...

9099
05:39:28,760 --> 05:39:30,180
Strange, then...

9100
05:39:30,740 --> 05:39:30,940
Groot.

9101
05:39:31,080 --> 05:39:32,160
And what do we protect then?

9102
05:39:32,320 --> 05:39:33,320
I guess we protect the thing.

9103
05:39:33,480 --> 05:39:33,700
Right?

9104
05:39:37,000 --> 05:39:37,820
They ban the thing.

9105
05:39:37,880 --> 05:39:38,700
We protect Starlord.

9106
05:39:40,980 --> 05:39:41,760
Okay, I was listening.

9107
05:39:41,920 --> 05:39:42,060
Yeah.

9108
05:39:42,420 --> 05:39:43,520
We can do...

9109
05:39:43,520 --> 05:39:44,860
Protect the thing or Starlord.

9110
05:39:44,980 --> 05:39:45,760
Depending on...

9111
05:39:45,760 --> 05:39:46,380
Their first ban.

9112
05:39:47,140 --> 05:39:48,640
Whatever they think is the best first ban.

9113
05:39:48,980 --> 05:39:50,120
And then...

9114
05:39:50,120 --> 05:39:51,020
Then we'll...

9115
05:39:51,020 --> 05:39:52,200
The second ban will just...

9116
05:39:52,200 --> 05:39:53,020
Depend on what they ban.

9117
05:39:53,120 --> 05:39:53,320
Yeah.

9118
05:39:53,520 --> 05:39:55,140
If they do rely on Punisher...

9119
05:39:55,140 --> 05:39:56,100
Do you want to go Psylocke?

9120
05:39:56,460 --> 05:39:57,260
Or do you think...

9121
05:39:57,260 --> 05:39:58,100
Starlord will be fine?

9122
05:39:58,220 --> 05:39:58,440
Okay.

9123
05:39:58,640 --> 05:39:59,460
You'll just go Psylocke.

9124
05:39:59,540 --> 05:39:59,960
Cause like...

9125
05:39:59,960 --> 05:40:02,740
They just rely on their Punisher...

9126
05:40:02,740 --> 05:40:03,940
As their winning...

9127
05:40:03,940 --> 05:40:04,600
Their like...

9128
05:40:04,600 --> 05:40:05,320
Win condition.

9129
05:40:07,280 --> 05:40:07,620
Alright.

9130
05:40:07,760 --> 05:40:08,180
They have...

9131
05:40:08,180 --> 05:40:08,960
But they have...

9132
05:40:08,960 --> 05:40:09,520
He has...

9133
05:40:09,520 --> 05:40:11,400
He's being pocketed by three of their supports though.

9134
05:40:11,420 --> 05:40:13,040
So, I don't know if you can deal with that.

9135
05:40:14,860 --> 05:40:15,520
I think...

9136
05:40:15,520 --> 05:40:16,320
I think it should be fine.

9137
05:40:16,500 --> 05:40:16,780
Okay.

9138
05:40:17,060 --> 05:40:18,520
So, maybe I should say...

9139
05:40:18,520 --> 05:40:19,340
I think Namor...

9140
05:40:19,340 --> 05:40:20,740
Can also like disrupt it too, right?

9141
05:40:20,900 --> 05:40:21,100
Yeah.

9142
05:40:21,220 --> 05:40:22,080
That's why...

9143
05:40:22,820 --> 05:40:24,120
I should also look for that.

9144
05:40:25,560 --> 05:40:25,920
Yeah.

9145
05:40:25,960 --> 05:40:26,380
So, we'll see.

9146
05:40:26,480 --> 05:40:27,740
I don't know what their ban line is going to be.

9147
05:40:28,860 --> 05:40:29,220
But...

9148
05:40:29,220 --> 05:40:29,660
Bro.

9149
05:40:29,720 --> 05:40:30,940
I'm watching...

9150
05:40:31,320 --> 05:40:31,680
Wait.

9151
05:40:31,820 --> 05:40:33,260
But what if he said it on purpose?

9152
05:40:33,780 --> 05:40:35,040
What if he said it on purpose while...

9153
05:40:35,040 --> 05:40:35,280
No.

9154
05:40:35,340 --> 05:40:35,600
No.

9155
05:40:35,780 --> 05:40:36,020
No.

9156
05:40:36,140 --> 05:40:36,740
There's no way.

9157
05:40:40,180 --> 05:40:40,540
Maybe.

9158
05:40:45,720 --> 05:40:46,660
They're both so tired.

9159
05:40:46,960 --> 05:40:47,120
Oh.

9160
05:40:47,920 --> 05:40:48,500
That's not good.

9161
05:40:48,860 --> 05:40:49,140
Nope.

9162
05:40:49,140 --> 05:40:49,640
Nope.

9163
05:40:50,940 --> 05:40:51,260
Nope.

9164
05:40:51,260 --> 05:40:52,320
Just need three.

9165
05:40:53,420 --> 05:40:55,800
But if they win the best of three, we get best...

9166
05:40:55,800 --> 05:40:56,680
We get a reset.

9167
05:40:57,820 --> 05:40:58,700
I thought it was best of five.

9168
05:40:59,300 --> 05:40:59,880
Best of five.

9169
05:40:59,900 --> 05:41:00,060
Sorry.

9170
05:41:00,140 --> 05:41:00,740
Best of five.

9171
05:41:00,840 --> 05:41:01,080
Sorry.

9172
05:41:01,640 --> 05:41:02,380
I can't count.

9173
05:41:02,920 --> 05:41:03,600
Now, we win this.

9174
05:41:04,200 --> 05:41:05,580
Do they have a loser's reset?

9175
05:41:05,740 --> 05:41:06,000
Or no?

9176
05:41:06,340 --> 05:41:06,620
If they win.

9177
05:41:06,620 --> 05:41:07,060
Yeah, they do.

9178
05:41:07,220 --> 05:41:07,480
If they win.

9179
05:41:08,420 --> 05:41:08,940
Oh, wait.

9180
05:41:09,040 --> 05:41:09,120
Wait.

9181
05:41:09,320 --> 05:41:10,040
A loser's reset?

9182
05:41:10,040 --> 05:41:10,960
Or if we win.

9183
05:41:11,080 --> 05:41:13,740
So, there's a system where...

9184
05:41:13,740 --> 05:41:16,340
If they lose, the bracket resets.

9185
05:41:17,200 --> 05:41:17,880
If they lose?

9186
05:41:17,880 --> 05:41:19,060
No, if we lose.

9187
05:41:19,320 --> 05:41:20,180
Oh, if we lose.

9188
05:41:20,260 --> 05:41:21,460
Oh, if we lose, we get a reset?

9189
05:41:21,460 --> 05:41:22,060
Yeah, because we're a winner's bracket.

9190
05:41:22,300 --> 05:41:22,800
We're winners.

9191
05:41:23,420 --> 05:41:24,120
Oh, okay.

9192
05:41:25,340 --> 05:41:26,580
Imagine if it worked that way.

9193
05:41:26,580 --> 05:41:28,380
It was just like, you got trashed again.

9194
05:41:28,460 --> 05:41:29,920
So, now, we're going to make you do it again.

9195
05:41:31,000 --> 05:41:31,900
Oh, that sounds bad.

9196
05:41:33,480 --> 05:41:34,340
Oh, my God.

9197
05:41:34,440 --> 05:41:35,620
I don't know if I want to do that again.

9198
05:41:36,100 --> 05:41:36,420
Yeah.

9199
05:41:36,920 --> 05:41:37,480
Let's just...

9200
05:41:37,480 --> 05:41:39,020
Listening to her comms is just so sweaty.

9201
05:41:39,580 --> 05:41:40,560
I'm like, oh, my God, man.

9202
05:41:40,580 --> 05:41:41,480
There's so much pressure.

9203
05:41:42,080 --> 05:41:42,400
Yeah.

9204
05:41:42,800 --> 05:41:43,580
Yeah, yeah.

9205
05:41:43,960 --> 05:41:44,280
Yeah.

9206
05:41:44,940 --> 05:41:45,940
You're right, Zeus.

9207
05:41:47,320 --> 05:41:48,940
Yeah, Zeus doesn't like it, too.

9208
05:41:50,160 --> 05:41:51,380
Too sweaty on their end.

9209
05:41:52,540 --> 05:41:55,240
I wonder if we could get... do 3-3 against their team.

9210
05:41:58,300 --> 05:41:59,280
I think we can.

9211
05:41:59,720 --> 05:42:01,440
We've got quite a few games to figure it out, anyway.

9212
05:42:01,540 --> 05:42:02,040
We're very good.

9213
05:42:02,380 --> 05:42:06,200
Also, like, do you think if there was a... if we need to do Hella, too?

9214
05:42:06,360 --> 05:42:07,080
If we need to?

9215
05:42:08,960 --> 05:42:09,360
Maybe.

9216
05:42:09,720 --> 05:42:10,940
We can do that.

9217
05:42:11,260 --> 05:42:13,280
I know they got fuck*d by Hella.

9218
05:42:13,580 --> 05:42:15,240
Yeah, they got fuck*d by Bucky and Hella.

9219
05:42:15,940 --> 05:42:17,460
And that's why they banned Bucky and Hella.

9220
05:42:17,700 --> 05:42:18,940
So, like, I'm just thinking, like...

9221
05:42:20,380 --> 05:42:22,080
That makes it easier on us, though.

9222
05:42:22,240 --> 05:42:22,520
Yeah.

9223
05:42:23,960 --> 05:42:26,440
And then, this time, they banned Bucky for those matches.

9224
05:42:26,800 --> 05:42:28,380
Yeah, they banned Bucky for those matches and won.

9225
05:42:28,960 --> 05:42:31,340
So, I'm just, like, wondering, like...

9226
05:42:31,340 --> 05:42:33,400
If that's the case, should we just run Hella?

9227
05:42:33,660 --> 05:42:33,840
What if we give them some PTSD?

9228
05:42:34,740 --> 05:42:36,740
Should we just run Hella, Bucky, then?

9229
05:42:38,020 --> 05:42:40,000
No, let them... they're gonna ban the Hella.

9230
05:42:40,860 --> 05:42:43,420
If they ban Hella against us, that's stupid.

9231
05:42:43,840 --> 05:42:45,200
Because you could just be on Starlord.

9232
05:42:46,540 --> 05:42:46,940
Yeah.

9233
05:42:49,060 --> 05:42:52,060
And then, if they want to do Hella Starlord, then they're really stupid.

9234
05:42:53,120 --> 05:42:54,740
Because that's such a waste of a ban.

9235
05:42:54,860 --> 05:42:56,960
I don't think they're gonna waste their bans on that.

9236
05:42:57,040 --> 05:42:58,000
That's way too dumb.

9237
05:42:58,600 --> 05:43:01,820
Like, I don't think their team made it to the Grand Finals.

9238
05:43:01,880 --> 05:43:02,980
I don't think they're that dumb.

9239
05:43:04,600 --> 05:43:05,000
Nah.

9240
05:43:05,840 --> 05:43:07,060
I just think that, like...

9241
05:43:07,060 --> 05:43:11,020
If you can absolutely destroy them on Hella, just run Hella.

9242
05:43:12,860 --> 05:43:13,980
Instead of Starlord.

9243
05:43:13,980 --> 05:43:14,320
I love Hella.

9244
05:43:14,980 --> 05:43:15,180
Huh?

9245
05:43:15,300 --> 05:43:15,860
Love it.

9246
05:43:16,200 --> 05:43:17,180
I'm not a good Hella.

9247
05:43:17,900 --> 05:43:19,380
Bro, you fucking destroy...

9248
05:43:19,380 --> 05:43:23,140
You can diff... I know you can diff their DPS as Hella.

9249
05:43:25,420 --> 05:43:27,980
I'm thinking, like, I'm playing on...

9250
05:43:29,580 --> 05:43:31,680
Their DPS is IPN and Kiryu.

9251
05:43:32,080 --> 05:43:32,540
Yeah, I'm playing on something else.

9252
05:43:33,640 --> 05:43:33,900
Oh.

9253
05:43:34,480 --> 05:43:37,720
I don't know who IPN or Kiryu was before you told me.

9254
05:43:38,920 --> 05:43:39,400
So...

9255
05:43:39,400 --> 05:43:40,640
Maybe they'll be good.

9256
05:43:40,680 --> 05:43:40,980
I don't know.

9257
05:43:40,980 --> 05:43:43,660
It'll be first impressions in the finals.

9258
05:43:44,160 --> 05:43:44,420
Yeah.

9259
05:43:46,440 --> 05:43:48,120
Are you going to go Starlord or...

9260
05:43:48,780 --> 05:43:50,080
Are you going to go Starlord or...

9261
05:43:51,440 --> 05:43:52,440
Or Hella then?

9262
05:43:53,860 --> 05:43:57,020
I kind of want them to ban Hella and let me Starlord.

9263
05:43:57,320 --> 05:43:58,880
Would that just give me free roam?

9264
05:43:59,040 --> 05:43:59,900
Well, then you have to do...

9265
05:43:59,900 --> 05:44:02,540
Then go Hella first and be a really scary Hella.

9266
05:44:03,620 --> 05:44:03,960
Okay.

9267
05:44:04,120 --> 05:44:05,040
And then they'll ban Hella.

9268
05:44:06,300 --> 05:44:07,000
I'll do it.

9269
05:44:07,440 --> 05:44:08,100
I'll do it.

9270
05:44:08,120 --> 05:44:09,560
If it doesn't work, then just go Starlord.

9271
05:44:09,780 --> 05:44:10,300
It's fine.

9272
05:44:12,040 --> 05:44:12,360
Alright.

9273
05:44:13,800 --> 05:44:15,040
Oh, are we banning out their Groot?

9274
05:44:15,280 --> 05:44:18,460
Yeah, we're banning out... No, we're banning out Mag first.

9275
05:44:18,740 --> 05:44:19,180
Not Mag, sorry.

9276
05:44:19,200 --> 05:44:20,260
We're banning out Strange first.

9277
05:44:21,440 --> 05:44:21,960
Strange, okay.

9278
05:44:21,980 --> 05:44:24,000
Yeah, because Maze will always protect one or the other.

9279
05:44:24,360 --> 05:44:26,840
Like, Maze will try to protect Mag or Strange.

9280
05:44:29,540 --> 05:44:29,860
Gotcha.

9281
05:44:31,560 --> 05:44:31,880
Sounds good.

9282
05:44:32,300 --> 05:44:33,580
And he also plays Groot, right?

9283
05:44:33,700 --> 05:44:34,500
That's why we're bringing that in.

9284
05:44:34,540 --> 05:44:35,100
Yeah, yeah.

9285
05:44:35,140 --> 05:44:38,080
And then we ban Groot because, like, we don't care about Groot players.

9286
05:44:38,080 --> 05:44:42,860
So we don't care about... like, you think the other players on their teams can be managed well?

9287
05:44:43,720 --> 05:44:47,740
He says that Strange helps him keep his team, like, together.

9288
05:44:49,120 --> 05:44:50,800
But if it doesn't work, we can just ban...

9289
05:44:50,800 --> 05:44:54,600
Yeah, but obviously if, like, it doesn't work, we can just ban Mag next time.

9290
05:44:56,640 --> 05:44:59,120
So they fall apart easily without Strange.

9291
05:44:59,420 --> 05:45:02,840
Yeah, I mean, that's their own self-report, so...

9292
05:45:02,840 --> 05:45:04,380
They said that.

9293
05:45:05,300 --> 05:45:11,340
And I think because his Mag has always been banned, like, he has been able to... he's been, like, playing Strange all the time.

9294
05:45:13,120 --> 05:45:16,460
And it's fine, like, Betel is stronger on Mag anyway, too.

9295
05:45:16,620 --> 05:45:17,920
So, it'll be fine.

9296
05:45:18,300 --> 05:45:18,780
Damn.

9297
05:45:20,900 --> 05:45:22,420
I know Betel will gap.

9298
05:45:23,400 --> 05:45:25,760
I meant, like... I meant, okay...

9299
05:45:29,160 --> 05:45:32,440
I meant more, like, his strongest character is Mag.

9300
05:45:33,360 --> 05:45:35,780
Oh, no, I know, he'll gap.

9301
05:45:36,060 --> 05:45:38,740
It's good to counter the Punisher comp, too.

9302
05:45:39,140 --> 05:45:39,380
Yeah.

9303
05:45:41,380 --> 05:45:42,320
I trust Betel.

9304
05:45:42,640 --> 05:45:43,520
I trust you, Betel.

9305
05:45:43,540 --> 05:45:46,140
As soon as he starts, like, firing, you just, like, lift up the ball and throw it.

9306
05:45:46,140 --> 05:45:48,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get your balls, too.

9307
05:45:49,320 --> 05:45:51,500
How fast does it charge when he's just firing with it, though?

9308
05:45:51,560 --> 05:45:52,380
Like, really fast, right?

9309
05:45:53,440 --> 05:45:55,960
Yeah, it charges real fast, so you gotta be quick with it.

9310
05:45:56,240 --> 05:45:57,660
So you just gotta throw it down immediately?

9311
05:45:59,320 --> 05:46:02,320
Like, 0.5 seconds time.

9312
05:46:03,520 --> 05:46:03,800
Yeah.

9313
05:46:12,740 --> 05:46:15,160
When does our game start?

9314
05:46:15,440 --> 05:46:16,500
I'm nervous.

9315
05:46:21,010 --> 05:46:22,890
When does it start?

9316
05:46:31,550 --> 05:46:32,190
Who's their team?

9317
05:46:32,310 --> 05:46:34,130
IP, I don't want to lose against that, dude.

9318
05:46:36,590 --> 05:46:38,130
Are you not a fan of him?

9319
05:46:38,750 --> 05:46:39,730
No, no, no.

9320
05:46:41,610 --> 05:46:43,070
He just doesn't want to lose.

9321
05:46:43,150 --> 05:46:44,170
You don't want to lose in general.

9322
05:46:45,850 --> 05:46:47,430
Yeah, I really don't want to.

9323
05:46:49,230 --> 05:46:51,010
Is there bad blood between you two?

9324
05:46:51,770 --> 05:46:53,010
No, there's no bad blood.

9325
05:46:53,770 --> 05:46:55,270
It's like banter.

9326
05:46:56,790 --> 05:46:57,190
Okay.

9327
05:46:57,830 --> 05:46:58,770
Yeah, I fucking hate that guy.

9328
05:46:59,470 --> 05:46:59,990
Oh, okay.

9329
05:47:03,890 --> 05:47:05,070
I thought we were bantering.

9330
05:47:06,830 --> 05:47:08,290
Good banter, good banter.

9331
05:47:08,450 --> 05:47:09,190
No, he's trying.

9332
05:47:09,370 --> 05:47:10,450
He's trying his best, you know.

9333
05:47:10,710 --> 05:47:11,450
He's a clip farmer.

9334
05:47:12,670 --> 05:47:15,250
I don't, okay, look, I don't understand.

9335
05:47:15,350 --> 05:47:16,430
Is that a bad thing?

9336
05:47:16,530 --> 05:47:17,770
I don't try to do it.

9337
05:47:17,870 --> 05:47:18,250
Is that bad?

9338
05:47:18,570 --> 05:47:19,230
Is that bad?

9339
05:47:19,370 --> 05:47:21,250
Guys, he's very vulnerable right now.

9340
05:47:22,150 --> 05:47:24,370
He's very vulnerable.

9341
05:47:25,170 --> 05:47:26,230
I'll ask you after.

9342
05:47:26,330 --> 05:47:27,070
I'll ask you after.

9343
05:47:28,850 --> 05:47:30,490
I don't know if that's bad or not.

9344
05:47:30,490 --> 05:47:32,490
Oh my god.

9345
05:47:33,830 --> 05:47:35,190
Oh my god.

9346
05:47:36,190 --> 05:47:37,130
Am I just feeding into it?

9347
05:47:37,190 --> 05:47:37,610
I'm going to stop.

9348
05:47:40,530 --> 05:47:42,150
Oh, he's so naive.

9349
05:47:42,630 --> 05:47:44,410
The internet hasn't ruined him yet.

9350
05:47:47,730 --> 05:47:49,350
You're not brain rotted enough, man.

9351
05:47:49,610 --> 05:47:50,270
Yeah, he's not.

9352
05:47:51,850 --> 05:47:54,330
I'm going to refill my water.

9353
05:47:54,450 --> 05:47:54,990
I'll be right back.

9354
05:48:20,110 --> 05:48:20,970
Alright, I'm back.

9355
05:48:21,010 --> 05:48:21,490
Hi, everybody.

9356
05:48:22,070 --> 05:48:22,430
Hey.

9357
05:48:22,430 --> 05:48:24,850
How was your bathroom trip?

9358
05:48:25,390 --> 05:48:26,210
It took like an hour.

9359
05:48:26,410 --> 05:48:28,490
It took a long time.

9360
05:48:29,410 --> 05:48:30,950
It's really stuck in there.

9361
05:48:32,050 --> 05:48:35,490
Yeah, everyone's just having gastrointestinal issues today.

9362
05:48:39,250 --> 05:48:40,710
We're good now, though.

9363
05:50:12,230 --> 05:50:12,610
Back.

9364
05:50:12,910 --> 05:50:14,210
Did they invite us to lobbies yet?

9365
05:50:15,530 --> 05:50:17,190
No, I'm getting antsy.

9366
05:50:17,730 --> 05:50:18,830
Oh, please.

9367
05:50:18,990 --> 05:50:20,790
I'm going to fucking freak out.

9368
05:50:22,950 --> 05:50:26,470
I'm going to go into the practice range so I can click on things.

9369
05:50:26,910 --> 05:50:28,590
Are they 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 5?

9370
05:50:29,490 --> 05:50:30,170
They... what?

9371
05:50:31,590 --> 05:50:32,370
No, they won.

9372
05:50:32,530 --> 05:50:33,070
They won.

9373
05:50:33,510 --> 05:50:36,890
Oh, we have to win 3 out of 5.

9374
05:50:37,210 --> 05:50:37,650
Gotcha.

9375
05:50:38,190 --> 05:50:39,450
Best of 5, best of 5.

9376
05:50:39,870 --> 05:50:44,430
And if we lose all 3, we get reset, so then we get another chance.

9377
05:50:45,450 --> 05:50:47,170
We get a lot of time, so...

9378
05:50:47,170 --> 05:50:47,510
Yeah.

9379
05:50:48,270 --> 05:50:48,670
Cool.

9380
05:50:48,670 --> 05:50:49,430
Wow.

9381
05:50:51,310 --> 05:50:51,990
Lots of adapting.

9382
05:50:54,090 --> 05:50:55,770
They're asking...

9383
05:50:55,770 --> 05:50:56,550
Yeah.

9384
05:50:57,410 --> 05:50:58,870
Apparently... I hope so.

9385
05:51:00,670 --> 05:51:02,170
I'm doing fine.

9386
05:51:02,950 --> 05:51:04,470
I'll be up and ready.

9387
05:51:06,270 --> 05:51:07,750
No more tummy aches.

9388
05:51:08,350 --> 05:51:08,990
No more.

9389
05:51:10,570 --> 05:51:11,750
I took ibuprofen.

9390
05:51:12,730 --> 05:51:13,310
No, ibuprofen.

9391
05:51:13,390 --> 05:51:13,910
Why did I say that?

9392
05:51:13,910 --> 05:51:19,290
I took Pepto-Bismol and some Alka-Seltzer and I'm all good.

9393
05:51:19,730 --> 05:51:20,270
That's good.

9394
05:51:20,350 --> 05:51:22,130
I was going to say ibuprofen can just make it worse.

9395
05:51:22,450 --> 05:51:23,930
Yeah, I don't know why I said that.

9396
05:51:24,830 --> 05:51:25,310
I don't know why.

9397
05:51:35,730 --> 05:51:36,690
Double KO.

9398
05:51:37,590 --> 05:51:38,890
Put us in the lobby.

9399
05:51:40,270 --> 05:51:40,650
Please.

9400
05:51:40,650 --> 05:51:41,230
I'm ready.

9401
05:51:41,850 --> 05:51:43,130
I'm so ready.

9402
05:51:43,290 --> 05:51:44,310
I just want to play.

9403
05:51:45,010 --> 05:51:46,590
I just want to play the game.

9404
05:51:46,850 --> 05:51:47,470
Give me the game.

9405
05:51:47,550 --> 05:51:48,310
Give me the game.

9406
05:51:48,730 --> 05:51:50,290
They haven't made the lobby yet.

9407
05:51:50,410 --> 05:51:50,910
I know.

9408
05:51:51,910 --> 05:51:52,970
I just want to play.

9409
05:51:58,120 --> 05:51:59,220
I got tired.

9410
05:52:00,580 --> 05:52:01,980
I can tell.

9411
05:52:02,440 --> 05:52:04,120
How's your team doing so far?

9412
05:52:05,480 --> 05:52:06,120
Gomez?

9413
05:52:06,520 --> 05:52:08,620
I'm questioning my team right now.

9414
05:52:08,880 --> 05:52:09,120
Why?

9415
05:52:09,220 --> 05:52:10,280
Are they not doing good?

9416
05:52:11,180 --> 05:52:12,200
Apparently not.

9417
05:52:12,640 --> 05:52:18,620
Because we always ban Groot first and they somehow decided, oh, Bucky's better first ban.

9418
05:52:19,880 --> 05:52:21,300
Who's subbing for you?

9419
05:52:22,220 --> 05:52:23,120
Oh, it's just Grimzo.

9420
05:52:23,500 --> 05:52:23,940
Oh.

9421
05:52:25,460 --> 05:52:28,480
My coach used to be a pro player and he still plays like one.

9422
05:52:28,800 --> 05:52:29,560
So it's fine.

9423
05:52:34,590 --> 05:52:36,250
How many matches do they have?

9424
05:52:38,510 --> 05:52:40,190
They have... I don't know.

9425
05:52:40,290 --> 05:52:41,330
I have to go check.

9426
05:52:42,490 --> 05:52:46,110
Check the bracket in our Discord.

9427
05:52:47,370 --> 05:52:48,690
Oh my god, what maps are we playing in?

9428
05:52:49,330 --> 05:52:49,710
Let's see.

9429
05:52:50,210 --> 05:52:51,050
I'll check.

9430
05:52:52,790 --> 05:52:55,590
Oh, we're playing...

9431
05:52:59,250 --> 05:52:59,990
Let's see.

9432
05:53:00,130 --> 05:53:00,950
Where is it?

9433
05:53:02,010 --> 05:53:02,750
Oh, wait.

9434
05:53:02,870 --> 05:53:05,050
What am I... My chat is so stupid.

9435
05:53:06,410 --> 05:53:06,810
Whoa.

9436
05:53:08,170 --> 05:53:08,870
That's mean.

9437
05:53:08,970 --> 05:53:09,510
That's mean.

9438
05:53:09,610 --> 05:53:10,110
That's fucked up.

9439
05:53:10,130 --> 05:53:11,230
They lied to me again.

9440
05:53:11,650 --> 05:53:13,110
They're about to 3-0 them.

9441
05:53:13,790 --> 05:53:14,190
Oh, wait.

9442
05:53:14,330 --> 05:53:15,270
Yeah, they're about to 3-0 them.

9443
05:53:16,270 --> 05:53:16,890
Wait, your team?

9444
05:53:16,970 --> 05:53:17,390
Oh, they're doing fine.

9445
05:53:17,850 --> 05:53:19,270
Yeah, my team is fucking them.

9446
05:53:20,030 --> 05:53:20,910
No, they just lied...

9447
05:53:20,910 --> 05:53:21,110
Oh, wait.

9448
05:53:21,170 --> 05:53:22,090
Did they actually 3-0?

9449
05:53:23,110 --> 05:53:23,790
They're about to.

9450
05:53:23,850 --> 05:53:24,710
Oh, I think they just lost.

9451
05:53:24,970 --> 05:53:25,750
Yeah, they just lost.

9452
05:53:25,890 --> 05:53:26,130
What do you mean?

9453
05:53:27,210 --> 05:53:27,890
Oh, never mind.

9454
05:53:28,030 --> 05:53:28,930
It's 2-1 right now.

9455
05:53:29,010 --> 05:53:29,510
It's 2-1.

9456
05:53:29,710 --> 05:53:30,810
I was like, what do you mean?

9457
05:53:30,870 --> 05:53:33,750
They just... I'm looking at it and they just lost.

9458
05:53:35,850 --> 05:53:37,330
That doesn't look like winning.

9459
05:53:38,290 --> 05:53:41,050
I just saw the defeat screen flash before my eyes.

9460
05:53:44,990 --> 05:53:45,630
My bad.

9461
05:53:45,770 --> 05:53:46,070
My bad.

9462
05:53:46,190 --> 05:53:47,670
But I guess they're doing fine.

9463
05:53:48,050 --> 05:53:50,070
It's a 2-1 at the moment.

9464
05:53:50,910 --> 05:53:51,050
Yeah.

9465
05:53:52,810 --> 05:53:56,050
They're going to have to start banning Groot now, as a beginning.

9466
05:53:56,570 --> 05:53:57,690
I mean, that's what we do.

9467
05:53:58,910 --> 05:54:02,130
Well, to be fair, no, we don't ban Groot, but we still keep him out.

9468
05:54:06,830 --> 05:54:08,170
Where's our lobby?

9469
05:54:10,350 --> 05:54:10,930
I don't know.

9470
05:54:11,230 --> 05:54:13,070
Let me find my lobby.

9471
05:54:14,090 --> 05:54:15,330
Look at all these people.

9472
05:54:16,310 --> 05:54:16,610
I'm in.

9473
05:54:16,970 --> 05:54:18,010
I caught them.

9474
05:54:18,690 --> 05:54:18,990
Yay!

9475
05:54:20,330 --> 05:54:21,270
Invite us.

9476
05:54:21,270 --> 05:54:22,250
This is it.

9477
05:54:25,750 --> 05:54:30,930
I'm going to invite Mason, too.

9478
05:54:31,690 --> 05:54:34,910
If we win three games, the tournament is over.

9479
05:54:35,490 --> 05:54:36,510
Three games.

9480
05:54:36,730 --> 05:54:37,590
Let's just win three.

9481
05:54:40,990 --> 05:54:43,890
Oh, no.

9482
05:54:44,030 --> 05:54:45,070
Okay, well, we can't start anyway.

9483
05:54:45,270 --> 05:54:45,790
Shoto's not here.

9484
05:54:46,330 --> 05:54:47,770
Shoto's in the practice range.

9485
05:54:48,890 --> 05:54:49,130
Yeah.

9486
05:54:49,130 --> 05:54:49,890
I'm not responding.

9487
05:54:50,930 --> 05:54:52,510
He's off seeing his rats.

9488
05:54:52,930 --> 05:54:55,130
Yeah, he's with his rats right now.

9489
05:54:55,410 --> 05:54:56,690
Oh, Beto, remember to join our team.

9490
05:54:56,770 --> 05:54:57,190
Team A.

9491
05:55:00,120 --> 05:55:01,120
Don't leave us.

9492
05:55:01,240 --> 05:55:01,840
Don't leave us, Beto.

9493
05:55:03,000 --> 05:55:03,880
What do I do?

9494
05:55:04,240 --> 05:55:05,400
Do you see the top right?

9495
05:55:05,480 --> 05:55:06,240
Yeah, there you go.

9496
05:55:06,540 --> 05:55:07,740
I'm just getting pulled around.

9497
05:55:20,180 --> 05:55:20,580
Shoto!

9498
05:55:23,060 --> 05:55:23,460
Shoto!

9499
05:55:27,260 --> 05:55:27,680
Shoto!

9500
05:55:29,700 --> 05:55:30,660
Should I ping him?

9501
05:55:32,280 --> 05:55:33,080
Yeah, we can ping him.

9502
05:55:34,480 --> 05:55:35,340
I'll ping him, too.

9503
05:55:35,420 --> 05:55:36,260
Let's all just ping him.

9504
05:55:40,100 --> 05:55:41,900
All as in me and Lime, I guess.

9505
05:55:44,560 --> 05:55:45,400
Good job.

9506
05:55:46,060 --> 05:55:47,600
We're joining the room.

9507
05:55:48,140 --> 05:55:49,220
Sorry, I wanted to get an apple.

9508
05:55:49,460 --> 05:55:49,980
I was hungry.

9509
05:55:51,600 --> 05:55:52,980
A red or a green apple?

9510
05:55:53,240 --> 05:55:55,100
You're in the practice range, so we can invite you.

9511
05:55:55,980 --> 05:55:57,500
It's a Honeycrisp.

9512
05:55:59,220 --> 05:56:00,820
Can I invite a Shoto?

9513
05:56:03,300 --> 05:56:04,340
The color's a Honeycrisp.

9514
05:56:05,180 --> 05:56:05,660
It's red.

9515
05:56:07,140 --> 05:56:08,520
I like red apples better.

9516
05:56:11,060 --> 05:56:12,460
Are y'all red?

9517
05:56:12,700 --> 05:56:13,300
Are y'all ready?

9518
05:56:14,420 --> 05:56:15,540
Are y'all red?

9519
05:56:15,940 --> 05:56:17,060
Are y'all red apples?

9520
05:56:17,400 --> 05:56:18,580
Are y'all here?

9521
05:56:20,260 --> 05:56:20,720
I'm ready.

9522
05:56:28,440 --> 05:56:29,560
Three games, guys.

9523
05:56:29,700 --> 05:56:30,280
Three games.

9524
05:56:30,620 --> 05:56:32,900
Gomez is just starting a fight now.

9525
05:56:37,120 --> 05:56:39,560
I feel like Ellie just responded with, gotcha.

9526
05:56:40,440 --> 05:56:42,600
The mod is just like, cool.

9527
05:56:44,400 --> 05:56:45,420
Happy for you.

9528
05:56:45,760 --> 05:56:46,500
Good for you.

9529
05:56:48,600 --> 05:56:49,680
Oh, Central Park.

9530
05:56:50,940 --> 05:56:51,740
Central Park.

9531
05:56:51,800 --> 05:56:52,960
I think we're attacking first, right?

9532
05:56:53,640 --> 05:56:54,340
Is this your team A?

9533
05:56:55,440 --> 05:56:55,720
Yeah.

9534
05:56:55,720 --> 05:56:57,680
Oh, never mind.

9535
05:56:57,780 --> 05:56:59,240
We're going to Spider Islands.

9536
05:57:03,330 --> 05:57:04,790
Gomez, you're gonna play Hela, right?

9537
05:57:06,730 --> 05:57:08,110
I'll do it for the first round.

9538
05:57:10,150 --> 05:57:11,370
Yes, we are.

9539
05:57:12,230 --> 05:57:13,390
I guess I'll double confirm.

9540
05:57:16,010 --> 05:57:19,470
If it's not working, you just swap off to Sire or Starlord.

9541
05:57:22,770 --> 05:57:24,570
What if they do something really weird?

9542
05:57:24,590 --> 05:57:25,590
Oh, Mesa's team has to be nice.

9543
05:57:25,650 --> 05:57:26,530
They got yelled at once.

9544
05:57:27,570 --> 05:57:27,850
What?

9545
05:57:29,030 --> 05:57:29,910
They got yelled at.

9546
05:57:30,570 --> 05:57:32,030
You got a yellow card?

9547
05:57:32,130 --> 05:57:33,310
Let's try to piss them off.

9548
05:57:35,150 --> 05:57:37,330
Wait, why did he get yelled at?

9549
05:57:37,390 --> 05:57:38,610
We said some shit too.

9550
05:57:40,410 --> 05:57:41,770
Yeah, but like...

9551
05:57:41,770 --> 05:57:42,850
Oh, but it's Mesa.

9552
05:57:43,050 --> 05:57:43,970
I know, I know.

9553
05:57:44,030 --> 05:57:46,790
He said it on my stream.

9554
05:57:47,330 --> 05:57:48,610
I remember it.

9555
05:57:49,630 --> 05:57:50,110
Oh, boy.

9556
05:57:50,690 --> 05:57:51,510
Wait, remember?

9557
05:57:52,150 --> 05:57:54,570
Remember when he Googled translated insults?

9558
05:57:55,570 --> 05:57:57,450
That was so fucked up.

9559
05:57:57,530 --> 05:58:03,030
No, Mesa once Googled translated insults in a different language.

9560
05:58:04,250 --> 05:58:05,990
Oh, I remember that.

9561
05:58:06,390 --> 05:58:08,430
That was so awkward.

9562
05:58:08,870 --> 05:58:10,150
That was so awkward.

9563
05:58:13,330 --> 05:58:15,570
I was like, bro.

9564
05:58:17,250 --> 05:58:19,210
And then we left the group after that.

9565
05:58:19,310 --> 05:58:22,430
He voluntarily left the group after that.

9566
05:58:24,830 --> 05:58:26,750
So what you're saying is Mental maybe...

9567
05:58:27,410 --> 05:58:29,010
No, he can crash out.

9568
05:58:31,170 --> 05:58:34,530
There is a possibility that we could crash him out.

9569
05:58:38,870 --> 05:58:40,890
I mean, it's a great comp to do it.

9570
05:58:41,050 --> 05:58:42,010
The comp that we were running.

9571
05:58:43,670 --> 05:58:47,250
One in two teams that we fought in ranked was getting pissed off.

9572
05:58:48,730 --> 05:58:52,190
The only thing, we have to have a good ban line though to be able to run 3-3.

9573
05:58:52,910 --> 05:58:53,530
Yeah, that's true.

9574
05:58:53,530 --> 05:58:54,030
Yeah.

9575
05:59:01,200 --> 05:59:03,220
I guess we're just waiting for the casters.

9576
05:59:04,840 --> 05:59:06,720
Yeah, both sides is ready, yeah.

9577
05:59:07,840 --> 05:59:08,220
Alright.

9578
05:59:15,110 --> 05:59:16,490
Whoa, Apple ASMR.

9579
05:59:16,830 --> 05:59:17,950
Damn, he's eating that shit.

9580
05:59:18,050 --> 05:59:19,990
Yeah, he's chomping down.

9581
05:59:20,410 --> 05:59:20,790
Sorry.

9582
05:59:26,290 --> 05:59:29,030
You also said Psylocke could be here, right?

9583
05:59:29,030 --> 05:59:32,310
If they're doing Punisher, we'd run Psylocke.

9584
05:59:33,510 --> 05:59:34,930
Alright, let's see what they first ban.

9585
05:59:38,490 --> 05:59:38,850
No?

9586
05:59:40,650 --> 05:59:41,130
Okay.

9587
05:59:42,650 --> 05:59:43,130
Change.

9588
05:59:46,450 --> 05:59:47,670
And then, protect the thing.

9589
05:59:51,510 --> 05:59:51,990
Wizards?

9590
05:59:52,230 --> 05:59:54,630
Yeah, and then we know what our second ban is.

9591
05:59:55,050 --> 05:59:55,450
Oh,

9592
05:59:59,620 --> 06:00:01,000
they're going to protect Groot.

9593
06:00:01,120 --> 06:00:01,760
That's interesting.

9594
06:00:02,160 --> 06:00:03,280
I'm not into that.

9595
06:00:07,040 --> 06:00:09,040
Do we get rid of Moon Knight or Namor?

9596
06:00:09,500 --> 06:00:10,860
They can't do the combo.

9597
06:00:12,340 --> 06:00:14,700
Moon Knight then, I guess, because we can run Namor.

9598
06:00:16,020 --> 06:00:16,980
What do you guys think?

9599
06:00:17,040 --> 06:00:18,420
Yeah, we can play Namor, they can't.

9600
06:00:18,840 --> 06:00:20,300
Get rid of Moon Knight for the combo?

9601
06:00:21,140 --> 06:00:21,820
Yeah, I'd like that.

9602
06:00:21,820 --> 06:00:22,060
Okay.

9603
06:00:27,850 --> 06:00:32,230
Alright, that's interesting, they protect Groot.

9604
06:00:32,370 --> 06:00:32,830
Ah, shit.

9605
06:00:33,350 --> 06:00:37,790
Yeah, I was muted, but I was like, oh, yep, they're going to ban Wolf right next to it.

9606
06:00:38,230 --> 06:00:39,770
Also, maybe not the Moon Knight.

9607
06:00:39,950 --> 06:00:41,370
I was a little bit hesitant on that.

9608
06:00:41,750 --> 06:00:42,990
Yeah, I was hesitant on it too.

9609
06:00:43,150 --> 06:00:44,310
I don't think they play Moon Knight.

9610
06:00:45,550 --> 06:00:46,090
Oh, okay.

9611
06:00:47,270 --> 06:00:47,930
Goddammit, Gomez!

9612
06:00:48,810 --> 06:00:49,590
I was muted.

9613
06:00:49,770 --> 06:00:50,670
Again, I'm new to this.

9614
06:00:50,850 --> 06:00:52,470
I don't know when I'm muted and when I'm unmuted.

9615
06:00:53,570 --> 06:00:56,050
If we seem to be ignoring you, you're probably muted.

9616
06:00:56,050 --> 06:00:56,410
Yeah.

9617
06:00:57,650 --> 06:00:59,890
Jake just put something in the Groot.

9618
06:00:59,970 --> 06:01:00,770
What do you guys think of that?

9619
06:01:01,430 --> 06:01:03,050
I mean, I guess it's for other games, but...

9620
06:01:06,250 --> 06:01:10,270
No, because they protect Strange.

9621
06:01:11,750 --> 06:01:12,830
They can protect Strange.

9622
06:01:15,730 --> 06:01:17,510
Do you want me on Sue or Adam?

9623
06:01:17,550 --> 06:01:18,030
I just realized.

9624
06:01:19,430 --> 06:01:20,510
Uh, Adam for now.

9625
06:01:20,850 --> 06:01:21,930
Yeah, and then we'll swap later.

9626
06:01:21,930 --> 06:01:24,410
Okay, I'm going to give Gomez the orb first.

9627
06:01:24,630 --> 06:01:26,010
Wait, what would you have banned instead of...

9628
06:01:28,970 --> 06:01:31,150
What would you have banned instead of Moon Knight?

9629
06:01:33,010 --> 06:01:35,550
Probably another tank that... or not another tank.

9630
06:01:35,710 --> 06:01:36,170
Like, Hela.

9631
06:01:36,570 --> 06:01:37,250
Oh, I see.

9632
06:01:37,290 --> 06:01:37,490
Okay.

9633
06:01:38,910 --> 06:01:39,570
Or Bucky.

9634
06:01:39,670 --> 06:01:39,970
Either one.

9635
06:01:41,730 --> 06:01:42,390
Yeah, they're on Hela.

9636
06:01:44,390 --> 06:01:45,510
Yup, I see the Hela.

9637
06:01:46,790 --> 06:01:48,210
Coming out right now.

9638
06:01:48,650 --> 06:01:49,250
I see the Groot.

9639
06:01:53,990 --> 06:01:54,630
Luna dead.

9640
06:01:55,510 --> 06:01:55,830
Nice.

9641
06:01:59,190 --> 06:01:59,910
Oh, Mesa's low.

9642
06:01:59,990 --> 06:02:00,270
Mesa's low.

9643
06:02:00,930 --> 06:02:01,250
Yup.

9644
06:02:03,410 --> 06:02:04,210
I got him.

9645
06:02:04,530 --> 06:02:04,850
Nice!

9646
06:02:05,050 --> 06:02:05,470
Groot one.

9647
06:02:05,690 --> 06:02:06,230
Groot low too.

9648
06:02:06,370 --> 06:02:06,570
He's one.

9649
06:02:06,650 --> 06:02:06,830
He's one.

9650
06:02:08,010 --> 06:02:09,610
I'm just farming for all of them.

9651
06:02:10,030 --> 06:02:10,830
I'm going to swap.

9652
06:02:11,990 --> 06:02:13,210
Can we guys get rid of these trees?

9653
06:02:13,270 --> 06:02:14,090
Get rid of these trees if we can.

9654
06:02:14,370 --> 06:02:15,670
I'm one.

9655
06:02:18,990 --> 06:02:19,370
You're fine.

9656
06:02:19,450 --> 06:02:19,630
You're fine.

9657
06:02:19,710 --> 06:02:19,870
You're fine.

9658
06:02:21,310 --> 06:02:21,970
Heal me up.

9659
06:02:22,070 --> 06:02:22,370
Thank you.

9660
06:02:23,490 --> 06:02:24,330
Oh, they know you're there.

9661
06:02:24,430 --> 06:02:24,910
They know you're there.

9662
06:02:25,070 --> 06:02:25,470
They know you're there.

9663
06:02:25,470 --> 06:02:26,370
Yeah, I'm backing up.

9664
06:02:27,390 --> 06:02:27,710
Got you.

9665
06:02:27,810 --> 06:02:28,530
Thank you for bubble.

9666
06:02:29,490 --> 06:02:29,650
Yup.

9667
06:02:31,110 --> 06:02:31,570
I'm okay.

9668
06:02:31,650 --> 06:02:31,810
I'm okay.

9669
06:02:31,990 --> 06:02:32,970
I have Coney.

9670
06:02:33,050 --> 06:02:33,430
I have Coney.

9671
06:02:33,510 --> 06:02:33,750
I have Coney.

9672
06:02:34,210 --> 06:02:34,670
Yeah, Coney.

9673
06:02:34,770 --> 06:02:35,450
Don't help me, Coney.

9674
06:02:35,830 --> 06:02:36,170
Got it.

9675
06:02:36,170 --> 06:02:36,350
Okay.

9676
06:02:36,370 --> 06:02:36,990
They're just going to wall you off.

9677
06:02:37,970 --> 06:02:39,470
Alright, coming back.

9678
06:02:40,090 --> 06:02:40,870
I froze him.

9679
06:02:44,830 --> 06:02:45,450
Low, low, low!

9680
06:02:45,630 --> 06:02:45,950
He died.

9681
06:02:46,110 --> 06:02:46,370
He's low.

9682
06:02:46,830 --> 06:02:47,210
Oh, lucky.

9683
06:02:48,310 --> 06:02:48,590
Nice.

9684
06:02:48,590 --> 06:02:49,710
Oh, I'm getting their noggins.

9685
06:02:50,550 --> 06:02:51,350
I'm moving up a little.

9686
06:02:52,190 --> 06:02:53,590
I might get walled off, but I'm aware.

9687
06:02:53,590 --> 06:02:54,470
We're looking for you.

9688
06:02:54,590 --> 06:02:55,030
We're looking for you.

9689
06:02:55,450 --> 06:02:56,690
We're trying to get rid of the trees, though.

9690
06:02:56,890 --> 06:02:57,090
Right here.

9691
06:02:57,150 --> 06:02:57,330
Right here.

9692
06:02:57,370 --> 06:02:57,590
Right here.

9693
06:02:57,750 --> 06:02:58,230
Oh, it's big!

9694
06:02:58,770 --> 06:02:59,190
It's big.

9695
06:02:59,270 --> 06:02:59,450
It's big.

9696
06:02:59,470 --> 06:02:59,750
Nice.

9697
06:02:59,810 --> 06:03:00,010
Nice.

9698
06:03:00,490 --> 06:03:00,990
Running in.

9699
06:03:03,250 --> 06:03:03,530

9700
06:03:03,890 --> 06:03:04,190
Got it.

9701
06:03:07,510 --> 06:03:08,070
Good shit.

9702
06:03:08,990 --> 06:03:09,530
Alright, I'm backing up.

9703
06:03:09,670 --> 06:03:09,990
I'm backing up.

9704
06:03:10,970 --> 06:03:11,790
They have their ults.

9705
06:03:11,910 --> 06:03:12,350
They have their ults.

9706
06:03:12,590 --> 06:03:14,530
They have support ults and they have their tank ults.

9707
06:03:16,090 --> 06:03:16,790
I've got rez.

9708
06:03:16,790 --> 06:03:19,350
Yeah, if they're going to use support ult, you rez.

9709
06:03:19,450 --> 06:03:20,690
Okay, I'm not going to use my support ult.

9710
06:03:21,750 --> 06:03:23,590
I'm not using support ult for Gragas anymore.

9711
06:03:24,390 --> 06:03:24,830
And Bucky.

9712
06:03:25,770 --> 06:03:26,910
So we're going full wipe here.

9713
06:03:31,410 --> 06:03:32,790
I guess you should trigger their...

9714
06:03:34,310 --> 06:03:34,950
Their combo.

9715
06:03:36,370 --> 06:03:36,890
Okay, maybe not.

9716
06:03:37,130 --> 06:03:37,350
I'm dead.

9717
06:03:37,390 --> 06:03:38,010
They're not comboing.

9718
06:03:38,150 --> 06:03:38,830
Rez, rez, rez, rez, rez.

9719
06:03:38,850 --> 06:03:39,050
Big rez.

9720
06:03:39,170 --> 06:03:39,390
Big rez.

9721
06:03:39,630 --> 06:03:39,850
Yep.

9722
06:03:40,090 --> 06:03:40,730
Yeah, good job.

9723
06:03:41,110 --> 06:03:41,670
Mech's too far.

9724
06:03:42,950 --> 06:03:43,470
Oh, damn.

9725
06:03:43,550 --> 06:03:43,790
I'm running around.

9726
06:03:43,790 --> 06:03:43,970
He's high.

9727
06:03:46,790 --> 06:03:48,730
I am ready to put on a show.

9728
06:03:49,270 --> 06:03:49,950
I have ult for this.

9729
06:03:50,710 --> 06:03:51,370
I'm coming back.

9730
06:03:51,770 --> 06:03:51,950
Nice ult.

9731
06:03:55,150 --> 06:03:55,730
Bucky dead.

9732
06:03:56,310 --> 06:03:56,790
Sue dead.

9733
06:03:57,070 --> 06:03:57,370
It's fine.

9734
06:03:58,130 --> 06:03:58,890
I'm behind though.

9735
06:03:59,130 --> 06:03:59,310
Okay.

9736
06:03:59,910 --> 06:04:00,690
I have ult here.

9737
06:04:00,910 --> 06:04:01,290

9738
06:04:01,310 --> 06:04:01,750

9739
06:04:02,670 --> 06:04:03,510
Alright, going in.

9740
06:04:04,990 --> 06:04:05,550
Good shit.

9741
06:04:06,350 --> 06:04:06,890
I'm on Groot.

9742
06:04:06,990 --> 06:04:07,310
I'm on Groot.

9743
06:04:08,310 --> 06:04:08,990
Yeah, nice.

9744
06:04:09,190 --> 06:04:09,510
No more ults.

9745
06:04:09,690 --> 06:04:09,830
No more ults.

9746
06:04:09,970 --> 06:04:10,230
No more ults.

9747
06:04:10,970 --> 06:04:11,590
Mech, mech.

9748
06:04:11,810 --> 06:04:12,090
Good shit.

9749
06:04:12,330 --> 06:04:12,790
Good job.

9750
06:04:12,870 --> 06:04:13,090
Good job.

9751
06:04:13,310 --> 06:04:13,810
Good shit.

9752
06:04:13,810 --> 06:04:16,350
They used both tank ults.

9753
06:04:16,390 --> 06:04:18,430
They still have Bucky and Namor ult.

9754
06:04:19,270 --> 06:04:20,570
We don't have Namor ult here.

9755
06:04:21,650 --> 06:04:22,310
Support ults.

9756
06:04:22,530 --> 06:04:23,430
Yeah, we have no support ults.

9757
06:04:26,550 --> 06:04:27,270
I'm backing up.

9758
06:04:28,070 --> 06:04:28,470
I'm backing up.

9759
06:04:29,950 --> 06:04:30,430
I'm fine.

9760
06:04:31,730 --> 06:04:32,530
Oh, fuck.

9763
06:04:36,530 --> 06:04:39,650
They're gonna have Bucky ult and Namor ult.

9764
06:04:39,810 --> 06:04:40,290
You're walled up.

9765
06:04:40,290 --> 06:04:40,870
You're walled up, Coney.

9766
06:04:40,930 --> 06:04:41,350
You're walled up.

9767
06:04:41,430 --> 06:04:42,030

Believe in you.

9773
06:04:51,550 --> 06:04:52,110
They're frontlining.

9774
06:04:53,210 --> 06:04:53,770
Mag hurt.

9775
06:04:54,890 --> 06:04:55,250

Oh, okay.

06:05:13,490 --> 06:05:14,230
I'm looking at their backline.

9807
06:05:14,390 --> 06:05:15,250
I'm looking at their backline right now.

9808

If they Groot ult, I might club.

9824
06:05:31,190 --> 06:05:31,910
Depending on how close.

9825
06:05:31,910 --> 06:05:32,610

06:05:33,150 --> 06:05:34,050

9831
06:05:36,150 --> 06:05:36,430
Bonding.

9832
06:05:39,150 --> 06:05:39,810
I'm backing up.

9833
06:05:39,830 --> 06:05:40,050
That's fine.

9834
06:05:40,050 --> 06:05:40,230
That's fine.

9835
06:05:40,290 --> 06:05:40,510
They missed.

9836
06:05:40,550 --> 06:05:40,750
They missed.

9837
06:05:40,790 --> 06:05:41,030
They missed.

9838
06:05:41,030 --> 06:05:41,030
He missed.

9839
06:05:41,150 --> 06:05:41,470
He missed.

9840
06:05:44,050 --> 06:05:45,290
I'm clubbing after this.

9841
06:05:46,290 --> 06:05:47,390
I'm clubbing after this.

9842
06:05:49,730 --> 06:05:50,450
I'm walled.

9843
06:05:50,790 --> 06:05:51,470
I can ult after.

9844
06:05:51,590 --> 06:05:51,990
I can ult after.

9845
06:05:51,990 --> 06:05:52,270
Got it.

9846
06:05:52,430 --> 06:05:52,910
He's low.

9847
06:05:52,990 --> 06:05:53,050
He's low.

9848
06:05:53,050 --> 06:05:53,090
He's low.

9849
06:05:53,090 --> 06:05:53,310
He's low.

9850
06:05:53,310 --> 06:05:53,430
He's low.

9851
06:05:53,450 --> 06:05:53,810
Damage.

9852
06:05:53,970 --> 06:05:54,130
Damage.

9853
06:05:54,170 --> 06:05:54,270
Damage.

9854
06:05:54,430 --> 06:05:54,790
Mag.

9855
06:05:54,790 --> 06:05:54,910
Mag.

9856
06:05:54,910 --> 06:05:55,150
Mag.

9857
06:05:55,550 --> 06:05:55,910
Groot.

9858
06:05:55,970 --> 06:05:55,970
Groot.

9859
06:05:56,150 --> 06:05:56,410
Groot.

9860
06:05:56,410 --> 06:05:56,970
Groot on the right.

9861
06:05:57,070 --> 06:05:57,230
One.

9862
06:05:57,930 --> 06:05:58,170
Frozen.

9863
06:05:58,430 --> 06:05:58,690
Groot here.

9864
06:05:58,990 --> 06:05:59,310
It's fine.

9865
06:06:01,830 --> 06:06:02,370
No more.

9866
06:06:03,510 --> 06:06:03,870
I got him.

9867
06:06:03,870 --> 06:06:04,150
Luna.

9868
06:06:04,150 --> 06:06:04,210
Luna.

9869
06:06:04,310 --> 06:06:04,450
Luna.

9870
06:06:05,190 --> 06:06:05,910
What the fuck?

9871
06:06:06,510 --> 06:06:07,230
No way.

9872
06:06:07,390 --> 06:06:07,710
There you go.

9873
06:06:07,890 --> 06:06:08,170
Nice.

9874
06:06:08,370 --> 06:06:08,610
Nice.

9875
06:06:10,050 --> 06:06:10,270
Nice.

9876
06:06:10,410 --> 06:06:10,570
Wait a minute.

9877
06:06:11,090 --> 06:06:12,190
I'm building buildings.

9878
06:06:12,450 --> 06:06:14,190
You pushed me off the map.

9879
06:06:14,870 --> 06:06:15,390
What?

9880
06:06:16,090 --> 06:06:16,370
What?

9881
06:06:16,430 --> 06:06:17,290
That's a kill there.

9882
06:06:17,790 --> 06:06:18,070
That's funny.

9883
06:06:18,650 --> 06:06:21,010
The roof fell on my head and I fell.

9884
06:06:21,450 --> 06:06:22,550
That's insane.

9885
06:06:23,710 --> 06:06:25,030
I've never seen that before.

9886
06:06:25,430 --> 06:06:26,070
That is...

9887
06:06:26,070 --> 06:06:28,290
I'll show you the clip later from my perspective.

9888
06:06:28,430 --> 06:06:29,330
That was unbelievable.

9889
06:06:30,130 --> 06:06:31,230
Did you see your PM?

9890
06:06:31,230 --> 06:06:31,410
Oh my god.

9891
06:06:31,410 --> 06:06:32,950
You killed yourself there.

9892
06:06:34,350 --> 06:06:36,330
It just looked bad, dude.

9893
06:06:36,530 --> 06:06:37,270
I don't know if it was...

9894
06:06:37,270 --> 06:06:42,690
It was because he wasn't shielding so much, but I was able to just fucking nuke so many full charge right clicks into Mag.

9895
06:06:42,810 --> 06:06:43,690
Oh my god.

9896
06:06:43,830 --> 06:06:47,110
By the way, I'm noticing now, I don't think they've ever played into a Psylocke.

9897
06:06:47,490 --> 06:06:48,990
Because they seem a bit lost.

9898
06:06:49,430 --> 06:06:50,610
They seem lost on that.

9899
06:06:50,750 --> 06:06:50,830
Yeah.

9900
06:06:51,190 --> 06:06:51,570
This is good.

9901
06:06:51,970 --> 06:06:52,490
That's good.

9902
06:06:52,890 --> 06:06:54,890
And then they'll just ban Psylocke and then get Starlord.

9903
06:06:55,990 --> 06:06:56,610
Or Hella.

9904
06:06:56,870 --> 06:06:58,130
I think they have to ban both probably.

9905
06:06:58,470 --> 06:06:58,730
Yeah.

9906
06:06:59,190 --> 06:06:59,770
And that's good.

9907
06:06:59,870 --> 06:07:00,830
It frees up tank lineup.

9908
06:07:02,590 --> 06:07:02,950
Yeah.

9909
06:07:03,090 --> 06:07:05,870
And then they have to deal with our tank lineup because our tank lineup is stronger.

9910
06:07:08,710 --> 06:07:11,830
Yeah, I felt like they were so busy dealing with you that the tanks were kind of left high.

9911
06:07:11,850 --> 06:07:13,590
Yeah, our tanks were just like...

9912
06:07:13,590 --> 06:07:15,410
They're just brawling it out.

9913
06:07:18,830 --> 06:07:20,230
We got a strong front line.

9914
06:07:20,750 --> 06:07:21,650
Alright, let's make this fast.

9915
06:07:21,730 --> 06:07:22,550
Make this fast, guys.

9916
06:07:24,190 --> 06:07:25,130
I believe in us.

9917
06:07:25,770 --> 06:07:27,130
Oh my god, the duck is in sight.

9918
06:07:30,030 --> 06:07:30,990
The peeking duck.

9919
06:07:31,910 --> 06:07:32,710
I'll take a picture.

9920
06:07:32,830 --> 06:07:33,050
I'll take a picture.

9921
06:07:33,250 --> 06:07:35,370
Take a picture of the celebratory duck.

9922
06:07:35,470 --> 06:07:36,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9923
06:07:36,130 --> 06:07:37,090
Let's eat it.

9924
06:07:37,190 --> 06:07:41,410
If you can put big rat in the background, that'd be great.

9925
06:07:42,030 --> 06:07:42,890
My rat?

9926
06:07:43,070 --> 06:07:44,130
Do you want me to bring my rat out?

9927
06:07:44,170 --> 06:07:45,090
I love big rat.

9928
06:07:46,130 --> 06:07:48,910
He loves me too, I think.

9929
06:07:49,170 --> 06:07:50,770
Or he wants to eat you.

9930
06:07:51,490 --> 06:07:53,590
Yeah, they heavy pocket their Punisher.

9931
06:07:57,430 --> 06:07:58,290
We're walking up.

9932
06:07:58,410 --> 06:07:58,750
We're walking up.

9933
06:07:59,590 --> 06:08:01,270
Oh man, I'll walk right now.

9934
06:08:02,830 --> 06:08:03,970
Oh, we're walled?

9935
06:08:04,090 --> 06:08:04,530
It's okay.

9936
06:08:06,130 --> 06:08:06,970
Keep your shield up.

9937
06:08:07,390 --> 06:08:07,970
Thank you.

9938
06:08:08,490 --> 06:08:09,310
I've got no bombs for now.

9939
06:08:12,070 --> 06:08:13,090
You're walled off here.

9940
06:08:13,710 --> 06:08:14,510
They have infinite ammo.

9941
06:08:14,650 --> 06:08:14,950
Infinite ammo.

9942
06:08:15,050 --> 06:08:15,350
Watch out.

9943
06:08:15,970 --> 06:08:16,270
I froze.

9944
06:08:16,390 --> 06:08:16,610
I froze.

9945
06:08:16,870 --> 06:08:17,370
I'm stuck in a fucking wall.

9946
06:08:19,930 --> 06:08:20,410
Go for it.

9947
06:08:20,450 --> 06:08:20,690
Go for it.

9948
06:08:20,730 --> 06:08:21,290
I'm gonna go for them.

9949
06:08:21,610 --> 06:08:22,130
I'm one, yeah.

9950
06:08:22,550 --> 06:08:23,830
I'm trying to keep up, but...

9951
06:08:23,830 --> 06:08:24,230
100 E.

9952
06:08:24,390 --> 06:08:24,570
Okay.

9953
06:08:26,230 --> 06:08:26,650
That's fine.

9954
06:08:29,930 --> 06:08:30,490
That's fine.

9955
06:08:32,290 --> 06:08:33,030
Wait right here.

9956
06:08:34,030 --> 06:08:34,670
I can't.

9957
06:08:34,710 --> 06:08:34,870
I couldn't.

9958
06:08:34,910 --> 06:08:35,710
You were in the side.

9959
06:08:37,690 --> 06:08:38,630
Just reset.

9960
06:08:38,750 --> 06:08:39,030
It's okay.

9961
06:08:46,230 --> 06:08:48,870
Yeah, and they have Loki clones too.

9962
06:08:53,550 --> 06:08:54,570
I'm reloading.

9963
06:08:54,950 --> 06:08:55,630
He's turning.

9964
06:08:59,770 --> 06:09:00,110
I pulled him.

9965
06:09:00,390 --> 06:09:00,850
Nice, nice.

9966
06:09:01,250 --> 06:09:02,970
Oh, we got rooted.

9967
06:09:05,330 --> 06:09:06,590
Oh, they're using everything.

9968
06:09:06,650 --> 06:09:07,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9969
06:09:09,350 --> 06:09:10,610
Wait, yeah, this is perfect.

9970
06:09:13,190 --> 06:09:14,270
That went through me.

9971
06:09:14,410 --> 06:09:16,470
I died so fast the game didn't register that I died.

9972
06:09:16,910 --> 06:09:17,490
That's funny.

9973
06:09:17,770 --> 06:09:18,850
Oh my god, they're huge!

9974
06:09:19,150 --> 06:09:19,510
Pony!

9975
06:09:20,870 --> 06:09:21,230
Is it?

9976
06:09:21,350 --> 06:09:22,670
It seems small to me, but...

9977
06:09:22,670 --> 06:09:23,510
Oh, no, no, it's big, it's big.

9978
06:09:23,690 --> 06:09:24,690
Big, it's big, it's big!

9979
06:09:25,410 --> 06:09:25,970
Come at me.

9980
06:09:26,190 --> 06:09:26,710
Go, go, go!

9981
06:09:29,190 --> 06:09:29,550
What?

9982
06:09:30,010 --> 06:09:30,830
Why'd they take that?

9983
06:09:32,230 --> 06:09:33,030
It works, though.

9984
06:09:33,090 --> 06:09:33,430
It works.

9985
06:09:33,990 --> 06:09:35,750
Oh, actually, you are...

9986
06:09:35,750 --> 06:09:36,110
Hold on.

9987
06:09:36,310 --> 06:09:36,650
Hold on.

9988
06:09:37,010 --> 06:09:37,870
Let's do it back to them.

9989
06:09:37,970 --> 06:09:38,190
Hold on.

9990
06:09:38,210 --> 06:09:38,710
What are we doing?

9991
06:09:38,710 --> 06:09:39,590
Do it back, though.

9992
06:09:39,750 --> 06:09:39,990
Do what?

9993
06:09:40,910 --> 06:09:42,190
Wait, dude, do Punisher back.

9994
06:09:42,270 --> 06:09:43,230
We just push around the corner.

9995
06:09:43,550 --> 06:09:44,290
It's one fight.

9996
06:09:44,870 --> 06:09:46,070
Do we win Rocket, then?

9997
06:09:46,610 --> 06:09:46,810
Yeah, go Rocket.

9998
06:09:46,810 --> 06:09:47,510
What do we do?

9999
06:09:47,770 --> 06:09:48,510
Trip support?

10000
06:09:48,890 --> 06:09:50,270
Okay, okay, okay.

10001
06:09:51,610 --> 06:09:52,530
Just hold right click.

10002
06:09:52,610 --> 06:09:53,230
That's all you have to do.

10003
06:09:53,710 --> 06:09:53,950
Okay.

10004
06:09:56,730 --> 06:09:58,210
Just let me know when you want the ammo.

10005
06:09:59,190 --> 06:10:00,710
Let me know when you want the ammo, okay?

10006
06:10:01,510 --> 06:10:01,990
Yeah, I will.

10007
06:10:02,070 --> 06:10:02,070
I will.

10008
06:10:02,170 --> 06:10:02,590
I'll let ya.

10009
06:10:03,230 --> 06:10:03,990
I'll let ya know.

10010
06:10:05,190 --> 06:10:06,170
They're pushing far out.

10011
06:10:06,230 --> 06:10:06,790
They're pushing far out.

10012
06:10:06,810 --> 06:10:07,350
Yeah, really far.

10013
06:10:12,860 --> 06:10:14,520
I'm putting on Coney the...

10014
06:10:16,560 --> 06:10:17,680
Let us know when you want the ammo.

10015
06:10:18,480 --> 06:10:19,020
Yeah, let me know.

10016
06:10:19,600 --> 06:10:20,480
I have ammo.

10017
06:10:23,260 --> 06:10:25,960
You have more?

10018
06:10:26,620 --> 06:10:28,640
He's getting shielded so hard.

10019
06:10:29,000 --> 06:10:29,280
I can't.

10020
06:10:29,380 --> 06:10:29,920
Watch out.

10021
06:10:30,040 --> 06:10:30,440
Just hold it.

10022
06:10:30,500 --> 06:10:30,740
Hold it.

10023
06:10:30,760 --> 06:10:30,980
Hold it.

10024
06:10:31,020 --> 06:10:31,420
Don't do anything.

10025
06:10:31,520 --> 06:10:31,880
Don't do anything.

10026
06:10:34,420 --> 06:10:35,780
Let me know when you have ammo again.

10027
06:10:36,200 --> 06:10:36,500
I'm 25.

10028
06:10:37,100 --> 06:10:38,680
I have ult now, but I'm filming.

10029
06:10:39,360 --> 06:10:39,800
I'm keeping...

10030
06:10:39,800 --> 06:10:40,680
Actually, uh...

10031
06:10:40,680 --> 06:10:41,420
Walk up.

10032
06:10:41,820 --> 06:10:41,960
Walk up.

10033
06:10:42,040 --> 06:10:42,300
Walk up.

10034
06:10:42,320 --> 06:10:42,680
Walk up.

10035
06:10:42,800 --> 06:10:43,100
Walk up.

10036
06:10:45,980 --> 06:10:46,620
I'm okay.

10037
06:10:48,160 --> 06:10:48,440
I'm okay.

10038
06:10:48,480 --> 06:10:48,760
I'm okay.

10039
06:10:50,660 --> 06:10:51,380
Do the rocket ult.

10040
06:10:51,520 --> 06:10:51,960
Do the rocket ult.

10041
06:10:52,580 --> 06:10:52,900
Punisher.

10042
06:10:53,460 --> 06:10:53,720
Punisher.

10043
06:10:57,160 --> 06:10:57,800
He's up.

10044
06:10:58,680 --> 06:10:59,000
Nek.

10045
06:10:59,140 --> 06:10:59,320
Dead.

10046
06:10:59,360 --> 06:10:59,680
That's you.

10047
06:11:00,620 --> 06:11:01,040
That's fine.

10048
06:11:01,120 --> 06:11:01,420
That's fine.

10049
06:11:01,700 --> 06:11:02,020
Ammo.

10050
06:11:02,060 --> 06:11:02,320
Ammo.

10051
06:11:02,400 --> 06:11:02,400
Ammo.

10052
06:11:02,420 --> 06:11:02,420
Stay.

10053
06:11:02,500 --> 06:11:02,820
Stay.

10054
06:11:02,820 --> 06:11:03,040
Stay.

10055
06:11:03,360 --> 06:11:03,780
Are you ready?

10056
06:11:03,860 --> 06:11:04,020
Ammo.

10057
06:11:04,140 --> 06:11:04,400
Ammo.

10058
06:11:04,400 --> 06:11:04,560
Ammo.

10059
06:11:05,200 --> 06:11:06,260
It's ammoing right now.

10060
06:11:07,280 --> 06:11:07,760
I'm ulting this.

10061
06:11:07,820 --> 06:11:08,160
I'm ulting this.

10062
06:11:08,680 --> 06:11:09,000
Punisher.

10063
06:11:09,000 --> 06:11:09,200
Punisher.

10064
06:11:09,340 --> 06:11:09,500
Punisher.

10065
06:11:11,480 --> 06:11:12,380
3, 2, 2, 2, 2.

10066
06:11:13,360 --> 06:11:15,380
Push up, push up, push up again.

10067
06:11:15,860 --> 06:11:16,880
They're gonna try a strange portal.

10068
06:11:17,120 --> 06:11:18,540
I'm gonna check if they swapped to strange.

10069
06:11:19,300 --> 06:11:20,460
No, they can't.

10070
06:11:20,760 --> 06:11:21,000
They can't?

10071
06:11:21,840 --> 06:11:22,780
OK, that's good, that's good.

10072
06:11:22,980 --> 06:11:24,480
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.

10073
06:11:25,200 --> 06:11:29,200
2 of the ta- Block me, spell can't- Nice!

10074
06:11:32,360 --> 06:11:32,720
Yep!

10075
06:11:34,840 --> 06:11:35,420
Good shit!

10076
06:11:37,640 --> 06:11:39,240
Yeah, they have a group.

10077
06:11:39,380 --> 06:11:42,680
We have a fucking... we have a big unmovable rocket.

10078
06:11:43,100 --> 06:11:43,680
This is way better.

10079
06:11:44,120 --> 06:11:44,120
Yeah.

10080
06:11:45,380 --> 06:11:46,340
Same badline?

10081
06:11:47,380 --> 06:11:48,960
Yeah, keep the same badline.

10082
06:11:49,680 --> 06:11:50,680
Wait, how do I do most damage?

10083
06:11:50,860 --> 06:11:51,500
Oh, Cody!

10084
06:11:52,500 --> 06:11:52,940
Obviously!

10085
06:11:53,940 --> 06:11:55,040
Obviously, bro!

10086
06:11:55,240 --> 06:11:55,700
Come on!

10087
06:11:57,100 --> 06:11:57,820
I went foolish.

10088
06:11:59,780 --> 06:12:04,340
If they're gonna run this at us again, then we should just mirror them, I guess.

10089
06:12:04,960 --> 06:12:06,740
Yeah, we can just mirror it.

10090
06:12:08,540 --> 06:12:10,520
Cody, that character was built for you, man.

10091
06:12:10,760 --> 06:12:11,520
He's so fun.

10092
06:12:11,680 --> 06:12:13,240
Dude, that ult seemed ass.

10093
06:12:13,320 --> 06:12:14,420
I can't believe that was good.

10094
06:12:14,680 --> 06:12:15,440
It was good.

10095
06:12:16,740 --> 06:12:18,700
Their Punisher is pocketed super hard.

10096
06:12:19,000 --> 06:12:19,740
That's what I'm saying.

10097
06:12:20,000 --> 06:12:21,440
That's their entire win condition.

10098
06:12:21,680 --> 06:12:22,780
They just pocket their Punisher.

10099
06:12:24,440 --> 06:12:24,800
Interesting.

10100
06:12:26,540 --> 06:12:27,840
They're a cheesy team.

10101
06:12:28,320 --> 06:12:29,880
Oh wait, guys, can you link me the clip?

10102
06:12:30,000 --> 06:12:31,940
Hold on, I'm gonna get my stream to link me this clip.

10103
06:12:32,020 --> 06:12:32,980
You guys gotta watch this.

10104
06:12:33,080 --> 06:12:33,880
This is insane.

10105
06:12:33,880 --> 06:12:35,440
Oh, the clip where you fell off?

10106
06:12:36,160 --> 06:12:38,160
Yeah, dude, hold on.

10107
06:12:38,860 --> 06:12:43,400
We could, like, if they protect Groot, do we just want to ban Rocket?

10108
06:12:44,980 --> 06:12:47,040
No, just keep the... Oh, actually, wait.

10109
06:12:47,720 --> 06:12:48,080
The Moon Knight.

10110
06:12:48,160 --> 06:12:48,680
They don't play Moon Knight.

10111
06:12:48,740 --> 06:12:49,420
Yeah, just ban Rocket.

10112
06:12:49,540 --> 06:12:49,740
Okay.

10113
06:12:50,320 --> 06:12:52,740
I mean, Ivern and Kiryu both can play.

10114
06:12:53,260 --> 06:12:56,340
They can play Moon Knight, but like, I don't know if they're good at it.

10115
06:12:56,380 --> 06:12:56,960
That's the thing.

10116
06:12:57,800 --> 06:12:59,660
Like, do you think you can counter the Moon Knight?

10117
06:13:00,600 --> 06:13:01,180
Oh, yeah.

10118
06:13:01,520 --> 06:13:01,860
Okay.

10119
06:13:03,420 --> 06:13:05,160
Psylocke's, like, a direct counter.

10120
06:13:05,500 --> 06:13:07,960
Okay, then we'll just ban Rocket then.

10121
06:13:08,260 --> 06:13:09,100
We'll do Groot-Rocket.

10122
06:13:09,580 --> 06:13:10,220
Actually, you know what?

10123
06:13:10,220 --> 06:13:13,340
I don't want them... Rocket is a good comp then.

10124
06:13:14,220 --> 06:13:19,720
No, I'm more confident of us just kind of going for the Moon Knight then, because maybe they're on it.

10125
06:13:19,760 --> 06:13:19,980
Maybe.

10126
06:13:21,060 --> 06:13:22,000
Maybe they're on it.

10127
06:13:22,140 --> 06:13:23,480
I mean, we could try it out for this.

10128
06:13:23,580 --> 06:13:24,220
Oh my god!

10129
06:13:25,020 --> 06:13:26,660
I don't think they do Moon Knight.

10130
06:13:27,160 --> 06:13:28,660
Okay, then we'll just... Yeah, we'll just do Rocket.

10131
06:13:30,020 --> 06:13:34,360
We'll their win condition is literally pocket the Punisher.

10132
06:13:34,500 --> 06:13:34,900
That's it.

10133
06:13:35,720 --> 06:13:37,960
Yeah, I feel like if we get rid of that, it makes it a lot easier.

10134
06:13:38,460 --> 06:13:42,720
Yeah, because the thing is that what counters Psylocke is triple support.

10135
06:13:43,060 --> 06:13:47,060
And if they triple support with a Moon Knight only while they do Groot combos, it's going to be super hard.

10136
06:13:47,120 --> 06:13:47,620
We 3-3.

10137
06:13:47,780 --> 06:13:48,280
Really hard.

10138
06:13:49,260 --> 06:13:50,080
We 3-3 Adam.

10139
06:13:50,200 --> 06:13:51,960
And then I'm just holding Moon Knight.

10140
06:13:52,420 --> 06:13:53,120
Oh, oh, yeah.

10141
06:13:53,840 --> 06:13:54,560
Okay, never mind.

10142
06:13:54,620 --> 06:13:54,840
We're good.

10143
06:13:55,040 --> 06:13:55,260
We're chilling.

10144
06:13:55,940 --> 06:13:56,740
I thought about it.

10145
06:13:57,620 --> 06:13:59,260
I thought about it and then...

10146
06:13:59,260 --> 06:13:59,680
Yeah, you thought about it.

10147
06:14:02,660 --> 06:14:05,500
I was like, Coney, I saw the clip on my chat side.

10148
06:14:05,700 --> 06:14:09,360
Dude, if that happened and the game was on the line, I would have been furious.

10149
06:14:10,220 --> 06:14:11,560
That was crazy.

10150
06:14:11,900 --> 06:14:12,600
It's in the chat.

10151
06:14:12,720 --> 06:14:14,600
Look at the Iraqi Raccoon chat.

10152
06:14:14,940 --> 06:14:15,880
Bro, please look at that.

10153
06:14:16,100 --> 06:14:17,420
It's so funny.

10154
06:14:18,520 --> 06:14:20,160
That was insane.

10155
06:14:20,380 --> 06:14:21,240
Who broke that roof?

10156
06:14:21,320 --> 06:14:22,920
Was it our own team that broke that roof?

10157
06:14:22,920 --> 06:14:24,200
None of y'all killed me, bro.

10158
06:14:25,940 --> 06:14:27,160
That's like hilarious.

10159
06:14:28,820 --> 06:14:30,140
Dropped the roof on my head.

10160
06:14:31,260 --> 06:14:32,240
Why did the builder...

10161
06:14:33,200 --> 06:14:34,640
Yeah, dude, I couldn't move.

10162
06:14:36,480 --> 06:14:37,680
I got executed.

10163
06:14:40,640 --> 06:14:41,720
Hang on, I'll show you that.

10164
06:14:42,000 --> 06:14:43,420
We still won that.

10165
06:14:44,800 --> 06:14:48,700
Yeah, that was the very end.

10166
06:14:48,960 --> 06:14:49,400
Thank God.

10167
06:14:51,140 --> 06:14:54,020
Dude, if that happened in the middle of it...

10168
06:14:55,180 --> 06:14:56,300
It was right at the end.

10169
06:14:56,600 --> 06:14:58,760
Like, right as we were killing Moon, which was nice.

10170
06:14:59,720 --> 06:15:02,780
Like Battlefield Revolution fucking knocked you out of the map.

10171
06:15:05,280 --> 06:15:06,580
Everybody's against us.

10172
06:15:07,380 --> 06:15:09,780
I've been griefed by... I've had that happen to me before too.

10173
06:15:09,840 --> 06:15:13,780
A roof fell on me and I cloak and dagger ulted and I got stuck in one spot and I couldn't move anywhere.

10174
06:15:14,240 --> 06:15:15,820
Like, he just dropped on top of me.

10175
06:15:16,160 --> 06:15:17,460
Like, I don't know why that shit happens.

10176
06:15:18,020 --> 06:15:19,560
I've seen that at Midtown too.

10177
06:15:19,740 --> 06:15:21,240
That happens a lot on the Midtown map.

10178
06:15:21,340 --> 06:15:22,220
I hate that map.

10179
06:15:22,300 --> 06:15:23,440
The translation thing, yeah.

10180
06:15:34,200 --> 06:15:35,400
Two more games though.

10181
06:15:35,420 --> 06:15:36,500
Let's get it.

10182
06:15:36,500 --> 06:15:37,280
Was this on defense?

10183
06:15:37,600 --> 06:15:38,200
Was this on defense?

10184
06:15:38,780 --> 06:15:38,940
What?

10185
06:15:39,080 --> 06:15:39,840
It is on defense, yeah.

10186
06:15:39,840 --> 06:15:41,840
That was like, right when we killed everybody.

10187
06:15:42,220 --> 06:15:44,200
Oh, wait, that's... Are we all ready?

10188
06:15:45,480 --> 06:15:46,480
Yes, I'm ready.

10189
06:15:46,680 --> 06:15:47,220
Everybody here?

10190
06:15:47,300 --> 06:15:47,540
Okay.

10191
06:15:48,220 --> 06:15:50,480
Alright, I'll just do... We are...

10192
06:15:58,160 --> 06:16:00,420
Watching it for a third person is so good.

10193
06:16:00,780 --> 06:16:02,080
Dude, I was like, what?

10194
06:16:02,280 --> 06:16:03,660
Maybe there's something I can do here?

10195
06:16:03,840 --> 06:16:04,320
Like, I was like...

10196
06:16:04,320 --> 06:16:05,540
I don't know who broke that house.

10197
06:16:05,680 --> 06:16:07,460
It would be funny if you broke that house yourself.

10198
06:16:07,660 --> 06:16:07,980
I don't know.

10199
06:16:08,080 --> 06:16:09,120
Wait, do we know who broke the house?

10200
06:16:09,980 --> 06:16:11,800
He probably fisted the house.

10201
06:16:12,540 --> 06:16:12,760
Yeah.

10202
06:16:15,120 --> 06:16:16,860
Dude, things just break shit by accident.

10203
06:16:16,960 --> 06:16:19,620
Like, when I start running, everything breaks around me.

10204
06:16:19,620 --> 06:16:21,200
Like, I can't run on a platform because the ground breaks.

10205
06:16:21,200 --> 06:16:23,020
Oh my god, Luna did it on accident.

10206
06:16:23,500 --> 06:16:25,180
Luna was trying to heal and...

10207
06:16:25,180 --> 06:16:27,920
Luna was trying to heal and broke the roof.

10208
06:16:28,240 --> 06:16:28,560
And died.

10209
06:16:29,000 --> 06:16:30,360
Okay, Domination.

10210
06:16:32,340 --> 06:16:33,220
They're gonna...

10211
06:16:33,220 --> 06:16:35,120
They ran Punisher and Domination too.

10212
06:16:35,200 --> 06:16:38,040
They ran Punisher to win this map.

10213
06:16:40,040 --> 06:16:41,280
Against Riggzy's team.

10214
06:16:46,180 --> 06:16:47,020
Wait, sorry.

10215
06:16:47,100 --> 06:16:47,440
Say it again.

10216
06:16:47,440 --> 06:16:50,860
They ran Punisher and Rocket to win against Riggzy's team for this.

10217
06:16:51,300 --> 06:16:52,180
So, Strange still, right?

10218
06:16:52,380 --> 06:16:53,760
Yeah, Strange still.

10219
06:16:55,900 --> 06:16:57,940
Oh, I wonder what their first ban is gonna be.

10220
06:17:03,680 --> 06:17:05,340
I didn't see that one coming.

10221
06:17:05,920 --> 06:17:06,320
Shocker.

10222
06:17:06,740 --> 06:17:09,700
Oh, I love that.

10223
06:17:13,080 --> 06:17:14,020
You know what?

10224
06:17:14,120 --> 06:17:15,800
For this map, I think we do ban the Rocket.

10225
06:17:15,800 --> 06:17:16,940
Rocket's really fucking annoying.

10226
06:17:20,620 --> 06:17:24,060
And if they protect Rocket, we just ban Punisher.

10227
06:17:24,740 --> 06:17:26,520
Okay, that's fine.

10228
06:17:27,680 --> 06:17:28,380
I have Loki.

10229
06:17:28,580 --> 06:17:30,460
Do we ban Groot or Rocket?

10230
06:17:31,360 --> 06:17:32,840
I think Rocket still.

10231
06:17:34,040 --> 06:17:35,260
We protect the thing.

10232
06:17:38,120 --> 06:17:41,660
And then we ban Rocket because...

10233
06:17:41,660 --> 06:17:43,800
Yeah, they protected him, but...

10234
06:17:43,800 --> 06:17:44,220
They don't protect it anymore.

10235
06:17:46,640 --> 06:17:51,900
I still think we should ban Rocket because I think the Punisher Rocket is more oppressive.

10236
06:17:52,220 --> 06:17:54,600
That's the only reason that was creating problems for us.

10237
06:17:55,520 --> 06:17:56,380
That's our name.

10238
06:17:56,840 --> 06:17:58,620
Yeah, that's why we fucking hate you.

10239
06:18:02,520 --> 06:18:03,540
Ready to play.

10240
06:18:07,680 --> 06:18:08,620
They're thinking.

10241
06:18:09,820 --> 06:18:10,420
They're thinking.

10242
06:18:10,520 --> 06:18:11,180
They didn't expect that one.

10243
06:18:11,180 --> 06:18:11,860
Oh, they're thinking hard.

10244
06:18:15,200 --> 06:18:16,860
Groot player can play Groot.

10245
06:18:16,940 --> 06:18:17,060
Yeah.

10246
06:18:18,380 --> 06:18:21,180
Are you gonna go Hello or...

10247
06:18:21,880 --> 06:18:22,200
Okay.

10248
06:18:23,820 --> 06:18:24,360
I don't know.

10249
06:18:24,440 --> 06:18:25,580
They don't know how to deal with Psylocke.

10250
06:18:26,120 --> 06:18:27,260
Wait, why did they protect me?

10251
06:18:28,260 --> 06:18:29,220
Oh, did you want the Atom?

10252
06:18:29,820 --> 06:18:29,940
Loki?

10253
06:18:30,600 --> 06:18:30,920
Oh, wait.

10254
06:18:30,960 --> 06:18:31,080
Sorry.

10255
06:18:31,240 --> 06:18:31,860
I forgot.

10256
06:18:32,020 --> 06:18:33,620
I was trying to pick Luna, but I...

10257
06:18:33,620 --> 06:18:34,380
Oh, okay.

10258
06:18:34,560 --> 06:18:35,160
I was confused.

10259
06:18:35,200 --> 06:18:37,760
I was trying to pick Luna, and I picked the wrong one.

10260
06:18:37,860 --> 06:18:38,740
I was thinking here.

10261
06:18:39,760 --> 06:18:40,480
I saw...

10262
06:18:40,480 --> 06:18:42,760
That means they're gonna run Luna and Namor.

10263
06:18:43,540 --> 06:18:45,860
They protected Namor, so they can do the combo.

10264
06:18:46,480 --> 06:18:47,420
They wanna do double combo.

10265
06:18:47,420 --> 06:18:47,420
Oh, I see.

10266
06:18:47,460 --> 06:18:47,720
I see.

10267
06:18:48,600 --> 06:18:48,960
Okay.

10268
06:18:49,480 --> 06:18:51,300
But we have the Res, so...

10269
06:18:52,000 --> 06:18:53,560
I'll just try not to get caught in it.

10270
06:18:53,660 --> 06:18:56,060
Link just kinda counters that whole combo.

10271
06:18:56,800 --> 06:18:57,820
Yeah, I'll Link it.

10272
06:18:57,880 --> 06:18:59,400
If we're all there, Link should be fine, right?

10273
06:18:59,540 --> 06:19:00,920
Yeah, but I feel like...

10274
06:19:00,920 --> 06:19:02,100
Wouldn't Res be better, though?

10275
06:19:02,220 --> 06:19:04,260
Like, Res and then I'll...

10276
06:19:04,260 --> 06:19:06,040
It kinda depends on when it hits, I guess.

10277
06:19:06,040 --> 06:19:07,260
Yeah, that's true.

10278
06:19:07,360 --> 06:19:09,840
They can Luna damage boost the Namor, too.

10279
06:19:10,000 --> 06:19:12,040
So that's what I'm worried about.

10280
06:19:12,940 --> 06:19:14,140
I'll give the...

10281
06:19:14,140 --> 06:19:18,500
Okay, I'll give the Snowflake to Gomez.

10282
06:19:19,640 --> 06:19:21,060
Stop fucking swapping!

10283
06:19:23,200 --> 06:19:24,040
I'm just dashing.

10284
06:19:24,160 --> 06:19:24,780
I'm just dashing.

10285
06:19:25,360 --> 06:19:28,300
Do they ever do anything other than Punisher?

10286
06:19:28,720 --> 06:19:29,160
No.

10287
06:19:29,660 --> 06:19:31,520
They try to do Bucky, but I...

10288
06:19:31,520 --> 06:19:33,760
He missed his ult, like, twice.

10289
06:19:38,340 --> 06:19:43,440
I love watching you guys, like, zoom ahead of me, and I'm like, I am the perfect being.

10290
06:19:44,140 --> 06:19:45,620
I'm so slow back here.

10291
06:19:46,040 --> 06:19:47,360
Magneto is actually...

10292
06:19:47,360 --> 06:19:49,980
It's annoying to push up with him.

10293
06:19:50,840 --> 06:19:54,720
Running at Mag, Namor...

10294
06:19:54,720 --> 06:19:55,940
I fucking hate this map.

10295
06:19:57,820 --> 06:19:59,380
And if I run, it will break.

10296
06:19:59,940 --> 06:20:01,960
I'm kinda...

10297
06:20:01,960 --> 06:20:02,460
Yeah, they have Hella.

10298
06:20:02,460 --> 06:20:02,920
They have Hella.

10299
06:20:04,560 --> 06:20:05,480
They're Hella, Bucky.

10300
06:20:06,200 --> 06:20:06,500
What?

10301
06:20:07,220 --> 06:20:07,760
Hella, Namor.

10302
06:20:10,340 --> 06:20:11,140
Walled off.

10303
06:20:12,240 --> 06:20:12,960
I got you.

10304
06:20:14,200 --> 06:20:15,760
I'm pushing up.

10305
06:20:16,420 --> 06:20:17,260
Pushing up.

10306
06:20:20,360 --> 06:20:21,800
I'm gonna get their healer.

10307
06:20:22,040 --> 06:20:22,680
Healer half.

10308
06:20:24,920 --> 06:20:26,020
She's jumping away.

10309
06:20:27,540 --> 06:20:28,540
Pushing Mace off.

10310
06:20:29,480 --> 06:20:30,420
Mace is half.

10311
06:20:30,420 --> 06:20:31,500
He's getting healed.

10312
06:20:33,480 --> 06:20:34,300
Mace is low.

10313
06:20:34,580 --> 06:20:35,560
He's backing up.

10314
06:20:36,580 --> 06:20:37,420
We got point.

10315
06:20:38,000 --> 06:20:38,660
We got it.

10316
06:20:43,160 --> 06:20:44,320
They're looking at you now.

10317
06:20:44,440 --> 06:20:44,920
We're pushing up.

10318
06:20:47,700 --> 06:20:48,400
Bucky dead.

10319
06:20:49,100 --> 06:20:49,420
Nice.

10320
06:20:50,360 --> 06:20:51,700
Your wall goes low.

10321
06:20:51,980 --> 06:20:52,400
Good shit.

10322
06:20:54,360 --> 06:20:54,900
They got Bucky.

10323
06:21:04,420 --> 06:21:04,820
Okay.

10324
06:21:05,760 --> 06:21:06,900
Oh, I got his head.

10325
06:21:07,120 --> 06:21:07,740
They're on triple support.

10326
06:21:08,640 --> 06:21:10,500
Oh, they went triple support.

10327
06:21:10,640 --> 06:21:12,500
I got this guy ulted up.

10328
06:21:13,580 --> 06:21:15,400
If need be, I can always lowkey.

10329
06:21:15,760 --> 06:21:17,580
I mean, that reset their ults, right?

10330
06:21:17,780 --> 06:21:18,320
I mean, some of them.

10331
06:21:19,040 --> 06:21:20,000
I kinda wanna ult.

10332
06:21:20,680 --> 06:21:21,420
You can do it.

10333
06:21:22,420 --> 06:21:22,820
Okay.

10334
06:21:24,840 --> 06:21:25,960
We got the Luna.

10335
06:21:27,500 --> 06:21:28,140
You're walled off.

10336
06:21:30,800 --> 06:21:31,600
That's fucking...

10337
06:21:31,600 --> 06:21:32,380
That's unlucky.

10338
06:21:32,800 --> 06:21:33,500
I have lava.

10339
06:21:35,800 --> 06:21:40,400
I got hit by it.

10340
06:21:40,660 --> 06:21:42,160
I'm backing up.

10341
06:21:43,120 --> 06:21:44,740
I'm backing up.

10342
06:21:45,140 --> 06:21:46,420
You rez under.

10343
06:21:47,380 --> 06:21:47,800
Rez under.

10344
06:21:49,480 --> 06:21:49,880
Wait.

10345
06:21:50,600 --> 06:21:51,400
On the point.

10346
06:21:52,060 --> 06:21:54,520
Oh, you don't have ult.

10347
06:21:55,500 --> 06:21:56,920
I thought you meant rez.

10348
06:21:57,180 --> 06:21:57,820
Okay, my bad.

10349
06:21:58,720 --> 06:21:59,340
That's fine.

10350
06:21:59,560 --> 06:22:00,540
I mean, we got 65.

10351
06:22:00,780 --> 06:22:01,220
Yeah.

10352
06:22:06,140 --> 06:22:08,500
They used both tank ults and aim ult.

10353
06:22:09,660 --> 06:22:11,980
They have both their support ults here.

10354
06:22:23,390 --> 06:22:24,990
I'm gonna walk up.

10355
06:22:25,370 --> 06:22:25,650
Really?

10356
06:22:26,510 --> 06:22:26,950
I'm low.

10357
06:22:27,090 --> 06:22:27,810
Can I get a quick heal?

10358
06:22:28,790 --> 06:22:29,550
Mech, mech, mech!

10359
06:22:30,370 --> 06:22:31,070
Okay, bubble.

10360
06:22:31,430 --> 06:22:32,170
Oh, I got him.

10361
06:22:32,170 --> 06:22:32,890
Oh my god.

10362
06:22:36,390 --> 06:22:37,250
I'm behind them.

10363
06:22:38,690 --> 06:22:39,950
Guys, we're up one.

10364
06:22:42,050 --> 06:22:43,270
We're up one right now.

10365
06:22:43,450 --> 06:22:44,210
They have no mantis ult.

10366
06:22:44,370 --> 06:22:45,230
Pushing, pushing.

10367
06:22:49,530 --> 06:22:50,230
Mantis down.

10368
06:22:51,190 --> 06:22:51,970
I'm on miz.

10369
06:22:52,370 --> 06:22:52,830
Go!

10370
06:22:52,830 --> 06:22:53,350
Move, move, move!

10371
06:22:53,470 --> 06:22:53,670
Go!

10372
06:22:54,030 --> 06:22:54,810
Miz, miz, miz!

10373
06:22:58,010 --> 06:22:58,410
Miz?

10374
06:22:59,770 --> 06:23:00,170
Okay.

10375
06:23:02,330 --> 06:23:03,570
They have gruud ult.

10376
06:23:04,630 --> 06:23:05,850
Make sure to rez.

10377
06:23:06,030 --> 06:23:07,110
We're gonna int for that gruud ult.

10378
06:23:08,250 --> 06:23:09,130
I'll just stay down here then.

10379
06:23:09,230 --> 06:23:10,790
Yeah, do that.

10380
06:23:11,450 --> 06:23:13,190
If you want heals, come to the window.

10381
06:23:16,850 --> 06:23:18,610
Maybe I'll just bounce on the bounce pad.

10382
06:23:19,750 --> 06:23:20,890
Don't stay near us.

10383
06:23:20,890 --> 06:23:22,810
Just hold, just hold.

10384
06:23:25,530 --> 06:23:28,330
You're walled up, you're walled up, you're walled up.

10385
06:23:29,370 --> 06:23:30,830
You might have to rez for this.

10386
06:23:33,070 --> 06:23:33,450
Nice.

10387
06:23:34,210 --> 06:23:35,250
Rez for this, rez for this.

10388
06:23:38,230 --> 06:23:38,610
Yes!

10389
06:23:41,670 --> 06:23:42,890
That's fine, we're fine, we're fine.

10390
06:23:42,970 --> 06:23:43,550
Everybody's fine.

10391
06:23:45,250 --> 06:23:46,710
Backline ult, waiting, waiting, waiting.

10392
06:23:48,010 --> 06:23:48,750
Ah, shit.

10393
06:23:48,750 --> 06:23:50,370
I'm on the gruud, I'm on the gruud right now.

10394
06:23:51,550 --> 06:23:52,630
Gruud's dead, yeah, gruud's dead.

10395
06:23:53,270 --> 06:23:56,630
I have ult here, I have ult here.

10396
06:23:57,790 --> 06:23:58,690
Support low, support low!

10397
06:23:59,870 --> 06:24:00,590
Mei's low, Mei's low.

10398
06:24:01,710 --> 06:24:02,710
Got it, nice.

10399
06:24:02,950 --> 06:24:02,990
Good job.

10400
06:24:05,050 --> 06:24:06,350
Need more, need more, need more, need more.

10401
06:24:06,930 --> 06:24:08,310
It's fine, it's fine, got it.

10402
06:24:09,730 --> 06:24:10,370
They used...

10403
06:24:11,570 --> 06:24:12,630
Did they use gruud ult?

10404
06:24:12,790 --> 06:24:13,710
Did they use gruud ult?

10405
06:24:13,790 --> 06:24:14,590
I don't know.

10406
06:24:15,010 --> 06:24:15,350
They did.

10407
06:24:15,350 --> 06:24:17,490
No, I didn't see it.

10408
06:24:17,490 --> 06:24:18,670
No, they did not, they did not.

10409
06:24:18,850 --> 06:24:20,270
They have gruud ult, they used...

10410
06:24:20,750 --> 06:24:22,710
They used mag ult.

10411
06:24:23,150 --> 06:24:24,590
And they used...

10412
06:24:25,390 --> 06:24:26,450
They used suu ult, yeah.

10413
06:24:27,690 --> 06:24:29,190
So they'll have their support ult anymore.

10414
06:24:30,250 --> 06:24:34,010
I was trying to time my ult to stop suu ult, but it didn't work.

10415
06:24:34,410 --> 06:24:35,790
We got them still though, which is good.

10416
06:24:37,330 --> 06:24:38,850
30 seconds before you attack.

10417
06:24:38,890 --> 06:24:41,830
Yeah, sorry, that was a bit stuffed because mag died way before anyone else, so I just had to come out.

10418
06:24:41,830 --> 06:24:42,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10419
06:24:45,390 --> 06:24:46,130
That's my bad.

10420
06:24:49,230 --> 06:24:51,010
Trying to get on top of it.

10421
06:24:52,330 --> 06:24:53,170
This wins.

10422
06:24:53,790 --> 06:24:55,130
No, what the...

10423
06:24:55,130 --> 06:24:55,330
Hello?

10424
06:24:57,690 --> 06:24:58,950
Why can't I put it... Wait, why?

10425
06:24:59,150 --> 06:25:00,930
This wins too, you're right.

10426
06:25:01,710 --> 06:25:02,870
They're all stronger.

10427
06:25:04,350 --> 06:25:05,230
Oh my...

10428
06:25:05,230 --> 06:25:07,430
I just want to see my spray, look at this.

10429
06:25:07,530 --> 06:25:08,170
The thing is stronger.

10430
06:25:09,990 --> 06:25:10,390
Yeah.

10431
06:25:10,390 --> 06:25:11,850
On my screen, yours was on top.

10432
06:25:11,970 --> 06:25:12,510
That's crazy.

10433
06:25:14,430 --> 06:25:15,170
That's funny.

10434
06:25:17,110 --> 06:25:18,210
Dude, I think you're right.

10435
06:25:18,310 --> 06:25:19,930
They don't seem to know how to deal with Psylocke.

10436
06:25:20,950 --> 06:25:21,210
Yeah.

10437
06:25:22,070 --> 06:25:23,470
Dopa's just running all over them.

10438
06:25:24,290 --> 06:25:25,450
I haven't seen anyone really run at him.

10439
06:25:27,010 --> 06:25:27,410
Oh,

10440
06:25:30,730 --> 06:25:31,370
nice, nice, nice.

10441
06:25:31,710 --> 06:25:32,090
That's huge.

10442
06:25:32,950 --> 06:25:36,050
Grookey died too, he was low.

10443
06:25:36,050 --> 06:25:37,970
Yeah, they're just walling us.

10444
06:25:38,210 --> 06:25:38,970
Someone cap though.

10445
06:25:40,090 --> 06:25:41,210
You cap, Coney, you cap.

10446
06:25:41,330 --> 06:25:42,750
I'm going to cap, I'm going to cap.

10447
06:25:43,570 --> 06:25:44,470
I'm going to point 2, yeah.

10448
06:25:46,050 --> 06:25:47,310
Why is it so bad now?

10449
06:25:48,510 --> 06:25:49,470
Why is it so bad now?

10450
06:25:50,310 --> 06:25:51,790
Why is my ult so bad?

10451
06:25:52,550 --> 06:25:52,870
Why?

10452
06:25:54,330 --> 06:25:55,050
We have to cap.

10453
06:25:55,110 --> 06:25:56,590
Why does it not go to her person?

10454
06:25:56,810 --> 06:25:58,850
We capped, we're good.

10455
06:25:58,850 --> 06:26:00,850
We are undefeatable!

10456
06:26:02,970 --> 06:26:04,630
Oh, they fucked up, they fucked up!

10457
06:26:04,710 --> 06:26:05,810
He fucked up, he fucked up.

10458
06:26:10,110 --> 06:26:10,790
Magneto on the healers.

10459
06:26:10,830 --> 06:26:12,510
Magneto, Magneto's on us, Magneto's on us.

10460
06:26:12,770 --> 06:26:14,070
You guys can touch, touch, touch.

10461
06:26:14,210 --> 06:26:15,710
We can, we can, Mag was on us.

10462
06:26:16,110 --> 06:26:17,330
They're on us hard, they're on us hard.

10463
06:26:18,270 --> 06:26:19,690
That's alright, I got no heals.

10464
06:26:20,310 --> 06:26:21,590
I'll pocket Bruin for that one.

10465
06:26:22,350 --> 06:26:23,130
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

10466
06:26:25,110 --> 06:26:26,390
They wasted Groot ult on them.

10467
06:26:26,390 --> 06:26:27,850
I'm asleep, I'm asleep.

10468
06:26:28,390 --> 06:26:29,370
Do you want me to rez you?

10469
06:26:29,630 --> 06:26:30,310
No, no, no.

10470
06:26:33,110 --> 06:26:35,390
I couldn't save Gomez when he was ulting there.

10471
06:26:35,730 --> 06:26:36,430
Do we want to go left?

10472
06:26:38,730 --> 06:26:40,070
Yeah, go left, go left.

10473
06:26:41,530 --> 06:26:43,330
Yeah, we should have died faster there.

10474
06:26:43,970 --> 06:26:44,630
I have ult here.

10475
06:26:45,410 --> 06:26:46,790
They have low heal.

10476
06:26:47,210 --> 06:26:49,310
You know, whoever you ult, you can wail it.

10477
06:26:50,010 --> 06:26:50,870
I'm going to do that.

10478
06:26:53,810 --> 06:26:54,850
I'm frozen.

10479
06:26:55,110 --> 06:26:56,170
Okay, that's great.

10480
06:26:56,330 --> 06:26:56,970
I'm ulting everybody.

10481
06:26:57,930 --> 06:26:59,070
Use ult, use ult.

10482
06:27:02,310 --> 06:27:03,910
I can block it, maybe.

10483
06:27:04,270 --> 06:27:04,650
I blocked it.

10484
06:27:06,330 --> 06:27:09,970
I need a heal.

10485
06:27:10,650 --> 06:27:10,910
Are you?

10486
06:27:11,790 --> 06:27:12,650
Thank you.

10487
06:27:12,650 --> 06:27:14,150
I like the cold.

10488
06:27:16,890 --> 06:27:18,650
I leave the...

10489
06:27:22,110 --> 06:27:22,750
Thank you.

10490
06:27:22,750 --> 06:27:23,890
Walking out.

10491
06:27:26,190 --> 06:27:28,930
Mag, mag.

10492
06:27:29,550 --> 06:27:30,510
I'm just going to ult the frontline.

10493
06:27:33,390 --> 06:27:34,350
I got Luna.

10494
06:27:34,830 --> 06:27:35,510
I got point, I got point.

10495
06:27:35,890 --> 06:27:37,890
They have no ult.

10496
06:27:38,250 --> 06:27:38,910
Do you have rez?

10497
06:27:40,930 --> 06:27:42,210
I'm rezzing.

10498
06:27:42,950 --> 06:27:43,290
Fuck.

10499
06:27:44,250 --> 06:27:44,590
That's fine.

10500
06:27:48,690 --> 06:27:50,390
I'm damage boosting, I'm damage boosting.

10501
06:27:50,410 --> 06:27:50,750
I can save ult here.

10502
06:27:52,070 --> 06:27:53,170
Save ult, save ult, save ult.

10503
06:27:54,410 --> 06:27:54,830
Save ult, yeah.

10504
06:27:56,290 --> 06:27:57,490
They grew up, they moored.

10505
06:27:57,990 --> 06:27:59,330
And they should have mag.

10506
06:28:00,330 --> 06:28:01,990
They should have one support ult for this next fight.

10507
06:28:02,430 --> 06:28:05,070
Kony, I think I'll save it to combo my ult with yours or something.

10508
06:28:05,190 --> 06:28:05,830
You got it, okay.

10509
06:28:06,450 --> 06:28:07,330
Wait, oh my god.

10510
06:28:07,870 --> 06:28:08,630
They're pushing up.

10511
06:28:08,630 --> 06:28:09,770
I was trying to give Kony...

10512
06:28:09,770 --> 06:28:12,950
I was trying to give Gomez the...

10513
06:28:12,950 --> 06:28:13,790
Someone's over on the left here.

10514
06:28:13,950 --> 06:28:19,990
I got you, I got you, I got you.

10515
06:28:20,330 --> 06:28:22,370
Alright, I have ult.

10516
06:28:22,550 --> 06:28:23,030
Just waiting.

10517
06:28:23,770 --> 06:28:24,410
He jumped in.

10518
06:28:27,370 --> 06:28:28,990
Mag is on us, mag is on us.

10519
06:28:29,310 --> 06:28:30,470
Mag is trying to kill us.

10520
06:28:31,290 --> 06:28:32,350
I'm slept, I'm slept, I'm slept.

10521
06:28:33,450 --> 06:28:34,570
Got point, point, point, point.

10522
06:28:34,630 --> 06:28:35,810
We're flipping point, we're flipping point.

10523
06:28:35,810 --> 06:28:37,630
I'm trying to get back, I'm trying to get back, I can't.

10524
06:28:38,090 --> 06:28:38,570
I'm back on.

10525
06:28:39,670 --> 06:28:41,090
I can block it, I can block it maybe.

10526
06:28:41,470 --> 06:28:42,030
Thank you.

10527
06:28:42,950 --> 06:28:44,710
We have to stop flipping point here.

10528
06:28:46,410 --> 06:28:49,330
We can let mag walk in, but we can't let them flip point.

10529
06:28:49,750 --> 06:28:50,150
That's okay.

10530
06:28:52,170 --> 06:28:54,270
Just run 3-3 or...

10531
06:28:54,270 --> 06:28:55,850
Yeah, we might need to run 3-3.

10532
06:29:01,210 --> 06:29:02,290
I agree, I agree.

10533
06:29:02,890 --> 06:29:03,890
I'll swap right now.

10534
06:29:05,850 --> 06:29:06,590
Wait, oh.

10535
06:29:07,070 --> 06:29:07,770
We're not there with you.

10536
06:29:08,450 --> 06:29:10,290
I tried something, it did not work.

10537
06:29:10,610 --> 06:29:12,970
Alright, I'm waiting for everybody, I can charge in.

10538
06:29:13,790 --> 06:29:14,990
You have to charge in now.

10539
06:29:15,350 --> 06:29:16,130
Going now, going now, going now.

10540
06:29:16,810 --> 06:29:17,930
Yeah, we have luna ult.

10541
06:29:18,510 --> 06:29:20,370
Break this, break this, break this, I can save coni!

10542
06:29:21,810 --> 06:29:21,990
Okay.

10543
06:29:22,630 --> 06:29:22,870
Nice!

10544
06:29:25,350 --> 06:29:26,210
Screw the Bucky.

10545
06:29:30,250 --> 06:29:30,650
Nice!

10546
06:29:32,570 --> 06:29:33,370
Holy shit!

10547
06:29:33,810 --> 06:29:34,510
My goat!

10548
06:29:36,090 --> 06:29:37,190
Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot!

10549
06:29:38,150 --> 06:29:38,750
Groot one!

10550
06:29:39,230 --> 06:29:40,310
Mace, Mace, get him in!

10551
06:29:41,050 --> 06:29:43,250
They have one fight, they have one fight here.

10552
06:29:43,570 --> 06:29:45,050
They have one fight, they have Groot ult.

10553
06:29:45,290 --> 06:29:46,070
I'm gonna have ult soon.

10554
06:29:46,910 --> 06:29:48,010
They have Groot ult.

10555
06:29:48,310 --> 06:29:50,830
I'm gonna hang back here so I can rez behind this wall if I need to.

10556
06:29:51,670 --> 06:29:54,150
I wanna hide somewhere with ult, but I don't know which way they're coming.

10557
06:29:54,150 --> 06:29:56,150
I think Mace knows it, which is why he's pushing us so hard.

10558
06:29:56,170 --> 06:29:57,410
Yeah, no, he's pushing me.

10559
06:29:57,650 --> 06:29:58,730
He's pushing me.

10560
06:29:59,430 --> 06:30:00,790
They're gonna walk in with luna ult, by the way.

10561
06:30:01,810 --> 06:30:03,790
I'm gonna ult their backline if they walk in here.

10562
06:30:04,890 --> 06:30:05,310
Wait, what?

10563
06:30:06,110 --> 06:30:06,370
What?

10564
06:30:07,410 --> 06:30:09,290
No, they waited like last second.

10565
06:30:10,190 --> 06:30:10,830
No more on the left.

10566
06:30:12,230 --> 06:30:13,050
They're more looking for our ult.

10567
06:30:14,150 --> 06:30:15,450
He has no bubble.

10568
06:30:16,370 --> 06:30:17,810
I got slept, I got slept.

10569
06:30:18,210 --> 06:30:19,430
I messed it up for them, I messed it up.

10570
06:30:20,530 --> 06:30:23,730
Use it, use it, use it.

10571
06:30:23,830 --> 06:30:25,310
Yeah, yeah, good job, good job.

10572
06:30:26,170 --> 06:30:27,310
We need copy, we need copy.

10573
06:30:28,710 --> 06:30:29,930
Where's luna, where's luna, where's luna?

10574
06:30:30,470 --> 06:30:31,450
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, please.

10575
06:30:32,250 --> 06:30:33,090
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

10576
06:30:33,150 --> 06:30:33,890
Copy, copy me.

10577
06:30:34,130 --> 06:30:34,710
Behind you, behind you.

10578
06:30:34,810 --> 06:30:36,330
Behind you, behind you, behind you, behind you.

10579
06:30:37,570 --> 06:30:38,890
I'm behind you, I'm behind you.

10580
06:30:39,230 --> 06:30:40,270
I'm in front of you now.

10581
06:30:40,890 --> 06:30:41,150
Nice.

10582
06:30:42,610 --> 06:30:44,710
Bro, everyone was jumping all around me, man.

10583
06:30:45,150 --> 06:30:46,190
I'm so sorry.

10584
06:30:46,190 --> 06:30:47,170
I'm so sorry.

10585
06:30:47,170 --> 06:30:50,170
Dude, there was like Bucky in front of me and shit.

10586
06:30:50,570 --> 06:30:50,930
Luna's dead.

10587
06:30:51,910 --> 06:30:52,770
I'm walking back, guys.

10588
06:30:53,630 --> 06:30:56,170
You got it, you got it, you can do it.

10589
06:30:56,330 --> 06:30:57,770
Get Mei's, Mei's, Mei's off.

10590
06:30:58,590 --> 06:31:00,550
Mei's one, Mei's actually one, Mei's one.

10591
06:31:01,070 --> 06:31:01,370
Got him.

10592
06:31:01,390 --> 06:31:02,730
Good job, guys.

10593
06:31:03,950 --> 06:31:08,050
Oh my god, I slept behind you and I went in front of you because you couldn't find me.

10594
06:31:08,290 --> 06:31:10,610
It was, bro, I couldn't see shit.

10595
06:31:12,150 --> 06:31:15,150
All I could hear was behind you, behind you, and I thought we'd been flanked as well.

10596
06:31:15,610 --> 06:31:17,890
No, because I got rezzed, I got rezzed.

10597
06:31:17,990 --> 06:31:19,650
Because I was on the point, I didn't die.

10598
06:31:22,230 --> 06:31:24,750
No, no, I was on point.

10599
06:31:25,070 --> 06:31:29,790
And then I died so I could be next to you, and then you were just turning around trying to find me.

10600
06:31:31,290 --> 06:31:34,110
That was so cooked, bro, I'm so sorry.

10601
06:31:34,370 --> 06:31:36,390
It was, we were lucky Coney lived.

10602
06:31:37,370 --> 06:31:40,270
I can't believe I lived, I actually can't believe it.

10603
06:31:41,990 --> 06:31:42,790
That's insane.

10604
06:31:42,790 --> 06:31:45,270
One more, one more, guys, one more.

10605
06:31:45,750 --> 06:31:46,810
You wanna know something, Coney?

10606
06:31:47,270 --> 06:31:50,910
The fact that they have such a low DPS comp, of course you're gonna live.

10607
06:31:51,770 --> 06:31:52,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

10608
06:31:53,770 --> 06:31:54,750
They can't kill me.

10609
06:31:54,770 --> 06:31:56,770
The only person that can do anything is their Neymar.

10610
06:32:00,010 --> 06:32:01,330
One more and we're done.

10611
06:32:01,650 --> 06:32:03,530
One more, one more, guys, one more.

10612
06:32:08,790 --> 06:32:10,650
That was too intense.

10613
06:32:10,650 --> 06:32:12,850
That was too close.

10614
06:32:15,690 --> 06:32:18,070
Should we try 3-3 on our last one?

10615
06:32:19,290 --> 06:32:21,130
I mean, we can, I don't think they expect it to work.

10616
06:32:22,070 --> 06:32:25,350
I mean, we ban Rocket still, right?

10617
06:32:25,470 --> 06:32:27,650
If we ban Rocket, it'll be really good.

10618
06:32:28,670 --> 06:32:31,610
If they save Rocket, then what do we ban after that?

10619
06:32:31,650 --> 06:32:31,950
Punisher?

10620
06:32:33,050 --> 06:32:33,450
Punisher?

10621
06:32:33,570 --> 06:32:34,670
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.

10622
06:32:36,130 --> 06:32:39,670
Dude, your Rock, like, I'm just saying.

10623
06:32:39,670 --> 06:32:41,210
That Rock was so clutch.

10624
06:32:41,330 --> 06:32:43,490
I was damage boosting, hoping for a miracle.

10625
06:32:43,850 --> 06:32:48,670
I was like, please slam dunk this Rock, fellow, you are damage boosted.

10626
06:32:52,990 --> 06:32:54,410
Dude, oh my god.

10627
06:32:54,850 --> 06:32:58,270
I feel like I blocked his ult twice with my bubble.

10628
06:32:58,490 --> 06:32:59,930
You did, that was crazy.

10629
06:33:00,110 --> 06:33:02,590
You blocked a one above all Mag ult.

10630
06:33:02,730 --> 06:33:03,250
That's crazy.

10631
06:33:03,710 --> 06:33:03,710
Twice.

10632
06:33:04,950 --> 06:33:06,090
I've never done that before.

10633
06:33:06,510 --> 06:33:07,930
This guy was rank one, showed up.

10634
06:33:07,930 --> 06:33:10,470
You were just like, I can block it, I can block it, and I'm like, you can?

10635
06:33:12,070 --> 06:33:13,210
Just remember, showed up.

10636
06:33:13,290 --> 06:33:16,930
Mace was rank one, several times, and you blocked it.

10637
06:33:19,630 --> 06:33:20,570
Is he crashing out?

10638
06:33:22,790 --> 06:33:25,270
I need you to invite me again.

10639
06:33:25,730 --> 06:33:27,910
I said yes, but it kicked me out of a lot.

10640
06:33:28,190 --> 06:33:29,130
It shows you in here, though.

10641
06:33:29,250 --> 06:33:29,610
Wait, really?

10642
06:33:29,690 --> 06:33:30,390
I'm not in it.

10643
06:33:30,470 --> 06:33:30,850
Alright, I'm back.

10644
06:33:32,410 --> 06:33:33,570
You might need to restart your game.

10645
06:33:33,730 --> 06:33:34,510
Okay, I'll restart it.

10646
06:33:34,590 --> 06:33:35,850
Yeah, I'm not in my menu.

10647
06:33:36,050 --> 06:33:36,710
They're both here.

10648
06:33:36,710 --> 06:33:40,870
No, but wait, what happens if I just play practice?

10649
06:33:41,870 --> 06:33:43,090
Oh, what the fuck?

10650
06:33:43,350 --> 06:33:45,170
I'm in a room, but I'm not.

10651
06:33:46,330 --> 06:33:46,810
Okay.

10652
06:33:47,830 --> 06:33:49,010
Solaris wants team A.

10653
06:33:49,390 --> 06:33:49,670
Oh.

10654
06:33:50,710 --> 06:33:51,650
That's interesting.

10655
06:33:52,650 --> 06:33:53,950
They want to defend first.

10656
06:33:55,370 --> 06:33:56,430
Okay, so we go B?

10657
06:33:57,250 --> 06:33:58,290
Wait, is that how it works?

10658
06:33:58,510 --> 06:34:00,130
Like, you just choose?

10659
06:34:00,490 --> 06:34:02,010
Yeah, wait, we can pick?

10660
06:34:05,250 --> 06:34:06,450
We can pick?

10661
06:34:08,310 --> 06:34:10,930
We're given an option to do that?

10662
06:34:12,010 --> 06:34:13,630
Yes, they get the first ban line.

10663
06:34:13,830 --> 06:34:14,370
That's why.

10664
06:34:18,970 --> 06:34:20,970
But, like, does it matter?

10665
06:34:21,490 --> 06:34:23,270
If they get the first ban line?

10666
06:34:25,430 --> 06:34:26,890
They also want to attack first.

10667
06:34:27,050 --> 06:34:28,330
Like, defend first, too.

10668
06:34:38,890 --> 06:34:41,970
Okay, I'm relaunching my game.

10669
06:34:44,870 --> 06:34:46,390
One more, one more.

10670
06:34:50,090 --> 06:34:51,770
So we gotta swap over to team B.

10671
06:34:52,150 --> 06:34:52,450
Yeah.

10672
06:34:53,250 --> 06:34:56,910
So, like, is it a rule that losers can choose which side they want?

10673
06:34:58,890 --> 06:34:59,870
I guess so.

10674
06:35:00,730 --> 06:35:03,390
I mean, we can just give that to them.

10675
06:35:05,210 --> 06:35:06,730
I don't think it matters too much, right?

10676
06:35:07,050 --> 06:35:08,530
No, it doesn't really matter.

10677
06:35:09,110 --> 06:35:10,730
It's basically morale, too.

10678
06:35:10,890 --> 06:35:14,470
You know, like, if they full hold us, they'll be more excited about pushing us through.

10679
06:35:14,470 --> 06:35:16,610
Type deal.

10680
06:35:16,810 --> 06:35:18,010
There's, like, a morale thing.

10681
06:35:18,590 --> 06:35:19,110
Okay.

10682
06:35:27,560 --> 06:35:28,820
Alright, invite, please.

10683
06:35:29,020 --> 06:35:29,540
I'm back on.

10684
06:35:30,040 --> 06:35:31,180
Yeah, I'm back, too.

10685
06:35:36,360 --> 06:35:38,480
I want to invite...

10686
06:35:38,480 --> 06:35:41,320
I cannot invite Cody anymore, for some reason.

10687
06:35:41,980 --> 06:35:42,780
I can.

10688
06:35:43,320 --> 06:35:45,720
Wait, I can!

10689
06:35:45,840 --> 06:35:47,040
Oh, wait, I can, yeah.

10690
06:35:47,820 --> 06:35:48,340
Nice.

10691
06:35:48,960 --> 06:35:49,600
That was weird.

10692
06:35:49,720 --> 06:35:53,300
I hit invite, and then it said, your request to join Cody's room has been received.

10693
06:35:53,440 --> 06:35:55,680
I was like, no, that's not what I wanted to do.

10694
06:35:57,400 --> 06:35:58,460
Okay, are we all ready?

10695
06:35:59,400 --> 06:35:59,760
Yes.

10696
06:36:00,340 --> 06:36:00,800
Ready to go.

10697
06:36:01,160 --> 06:36:01,920
Gomez, are you here?

10698
06:36:03,620 --> 06:36:04,580
Yeah, I'm here.

10699
06:36:04,760 --> 06:36:05,020
I'm here.

10700
06:36:05,320 --> 06:36:06,300
Oh, they want three minutes.

10701
06:36:06,500 --> 06:36:08,560
Okay, how about... Shredder, are you here?

10702
06:36:09,460 --> 06:36:10,240
I'm good, yeah.

10703
06:36:10,260 --> 06:36:10,580
I'm here.

10704
06:36:10,660 --> 06:36:13,420
Okay, so we'll just say we're ready, and then they just have three minutes anyway.

10705
06:36:13,860 --> 06:36:14,460
We are ready.

10706
06:36:14,960 --> 06:36:16,240
I'll run to the bathroom real quick.

10707
06:36:16,280 --> 06:36:16,540
Whenever.

10708
06:36:16,540 --> 06:36:19,060
Yeah, we're ready.

10709
06:36:19,280 --> 06:36:21,320
We know what we're banning and saving.

10710
06:36:21,480 --> 06:36:22,440
Just save the thing if you can.

10711
06:36:25,000 --> 06:36:28,680
If they end up banning the thing, we'll just save Starlord.

10712
06:36:29,440 --> 06:36:30,380
Yeah, we save Starlord.

10713
06:36:30,640 --> 06:36:30,820
Yeah.

10714
06:36:42,850 --> 06:36:46,270
I think Maze is definitely hard focused on me right now.

10715
06:36:46,750 --> 06:36:50,050
He's literally walking through everybody just to kill me.

10716
06:36:50,110 --> 06:36:51,070
It's fucking crazy.

10717
06:36:52,570 --> 06:36:54,530
He's just waiting through us.

10718
06:36:59,170 --> 06:37:00,870
I was like, bro, what the fuck?

10719
06:37:18,660 --> 06:37:19,920
Oh, chat.

10720
06:37:20,540 --> 06:37:21,260
One game.

10721
06:37:21,560 --> 06:37:23,240
One game, guys.

10722
06:37:23,660 --> 06:37:25,940
Just one more game.

10723
06:37:27,340 --> 06:37:29,200
I am nervous.

10724
06:37:30,000 --> 06:37:31,100
I'm very nervous.

10725
06:37:36,450 --> 06:37:39,550
Yeah, I don't know how to feel.

10726
06:37:40,990 --> 06:37:44,350
These games have been incredibly stressful, guys.

10727
06:37:44,870 --> 06:37:46,510
Very, very stressful.

10728
06:37:57,850 --> 06:37:58,570
Yeah.

10729
06:38:01,330 --> 06:38:02,850
Just need one more.

10730
06:38:03,210 --> 06:38:04,430
Just one more.

10731
06:38:04,430 --> 06:38:05,270
Oh.

10732
06:38:13,090 --> 06:38:14,690
Yeah, they kept flipping point.

10733
06:38:14,830 --> 06:38:15,690
That was our issue.

10734
06:38:15,990 --> 06:38:18,070
Like, we just keep letting them flip point.

10735
06:38:18,470 --> 06:38:24,850
Because I'd be like, bro, how can one guy not die?

10736
06:38:24,970 --> 06:38:26,810
I was just like, guys, please.

10737
06:38:27,390 --> 06:38:29,770
I should have just ran to the side or some shit.

10738
06:38:29,870 --> 06:38:30,950
Like, I just ran off.

10739
06:38:31,530 --> 06:38:33,310
Alright, we're ready to go.

10740
06:38:34,830 --> 06:38:35,970
One more and we're done.

10741
06:38:37,650 --> 06:38:39,110
Let's do it.

10742
06:38:39,710 --> 06:38:41,150
Okay, I said I.

10743
06:38:43,550 --> 06:38:45,010
They should be ready.

10744
06:38:45,250 --> 06:38:45,990
Guys, I fucked up.

10745
06:38:46,110 --> 06:38:46,530
What?

10746
06:38:48,150 --> 06:38:50,410
You know how I was having stomach problems?

10747
06:38:50,650 --> 06:38:50,910
Yeah.

10748
06:38:52,470 --> 06:38:55,170
My dad brought me sushi and instinctively I ate it.

10749
06:38:55,730 --> 06:38:58,490
What is wrong with you?

10750
06:38:58,670 --> 06:38:59,470
What is wrong with you?

10751
06:38:59,730 --> 06:39:01,270
I think you have a tapeworm.

10752
06:39:02,330 --> 06:39:03,030
Are you okay?

10753
06:39:03,130 --> 06:39:04,710
Are you having stomach problems again?

10754
06:39:04,710 --> 06:39:08,850
No, no, but if it happens, I'll be proud.

10755
06:39:08,850 --> 06:39:09,110
Okay, one game.

10756
06:39:09,310 --> 06:39:10,650
Gomez, we have one game.

10757
06:39:10,770 --> 06:39:14,330
Lock the fuck in and then get your stomach worms later.

10758
06:39:15,110 --> 06:39:15,590
Just win!

10759
06:39:15,590 --> 06:39:15,670
Win!

10760
06:39:16,990 --> 06:39:18,470
Okay, I'm going to go breathe.

10761
06:39:18,610 --> 06:39:20,030
The band line won't last long, right?

10762
06:39:20,110 --> 06:39:20,730
Okay, I'll be back.

10763
06:39:24,570 --> 06:39:25,530
Alright, change.

10764
06:39:25,910 --> 06:39:26,950
Do we say band line?

10765
06:39:27,330 --> 06:39:27,770
Change.

10766
06:39:31,910 --> 06:39:32,710
Change, Rocket.

10767
06:39:32,710 --> 06:39:35,290
Who am I going to banish from this match?

10768
06:39:36,210 --> 06:39:36,790
Strange Rocket.

10769
06:39:36,790 --> 06:39:38,150
Are they going to protect Strange, you think?

10770
06:39:38,730 --> 06:39:40,030
No, we ban.

10771
06:39:40,050 --> 06:39:40,530
No, we ban.

10772
06:39:45,420 --> 06:39:47,360
They always let the... okay.

10773
06:39:53,120 --> 06:39:53,440
Okay.

10774
06:39:54,320 --> 06:39:57,160
So now we just ban Thing and... I mean we ban Rocket.

10775
06:39:57,340 --> 06:39:58,600
We protect Thing and Rocket.

10776
06:39:58,880 --> 06:40:01,060
Only heroes will get my cosmic favor today.

10777
06:40:05,890 --> 06:40:06,850
Okay, get...

10778
06:40:07,930 --> 06:40:09,910
I wonder why they wanted to switch sides.

10779
06:40:10,750 --> 06:40:11,590
Um, morale.

10780
06:40:12,210 --> 06:40:12,610
Rocket?

10781
06:40:13,010 --> 06:40:13,450
Right.

10782
06:40:13,990 --> 06:40:14,370
Yup.

10783
06:40:15,070 --> 06:40:19,290
Because if they full hold us first point, then they'll be like, oh guys, just one point, you know?

10784
06:40:20,130 --> 06:40:20,410
Mhm.

10785
06:40:33,490 --> 06:40:34,370
They're thinking.

10786
06:40:36,130 --> 06:40:36,870
We'll win.

10787
06:40:37,110 --> 06:40:37,310
Alright.

10788
06:40:37,470 --> 06:40:37,710
Alright.

10789
06:40:38,150 --> 06:40:40,210
A lot of thinking for the same band lines on both sides.

10790
06:40:40,230 --> 06:40:41,370
Yeah, I was going to say that.

10791
06:40:41,830 --> 06:40:45,970
I have a feeling you're going to triple support.

10792
06:40:47,030 --> 06:40:47,470
Yeah.

10793
06:40:47,710 --> 06:40:49,270
I'm going to start with a triple.

10794
06:40:49,490 --> 06:40:50,050
We'll start with a triple.

10795
06:40:51,810 --> 06:40:52,270
Oh gosh.

10796
06:40:52,650 --> 06:40:53,270
Sue or Adam.

10797
06:40:55,590 --> 06:40:56,890
You can run this first.

10798
06:40:57,070 --> 06:40:57,290
Oh.

10799
06:40:57,550 --> 06:40:57,670
Right?

10800
06:40:57,890 --> 06:40:58,070
Okay.

10801
06:40:58,370 --> 06:40:58,890
I think Adam.

10802
06:40:59,190 --> 06:40:59,290
Right?

10803
06:40:59,450 --> 06:40:59,650
Yeah.

10804
06:40:59,810 --> 06:41:00,430
You have enough healing.

10805
06:41:00,870 --> 06:41:01,110
Alright.

10806
06:41:02,430 --> 06:41:04,410
Should we run Hela or Bucky, Gomez?

10807
06:41:05,290 --> 06:41:06,850
Because Hela might be really good too.

10808
06:41:07,470 --> 06:41:09,350
Bucky and triple supports is way better for her.

10809
06:41:09,450 --> 06:41:09,750
Okay.

10810
06:41:10,410 --> 06:41:10,570
Okay.

10811
06:41:16,540 --> 06:41:19,960
It's like we beat that first theme game.

10812
06:41:20,160 --> 06:41:22,620
We did triple support Hela last time.

10813
06:41:24,620 --> 06:41:27,420
I wasn't able to beat them so I'm just wondering if it'll be better.

10814
06:41:30,020 --> 06:41:31,240
We'll see what happens.

10815
06:41:31,340 --> 06:41:32,320
We'll see what they have.

10816
06:41:32,680 --> 06:41:32,800
Yeah.

10817
06:41:37,080 --> 06:41:41,980
I'm running on old low settings so this texture here looks so shitty.

10818
06:41:44,960 --> 06:41:45,780
Oh yeah,

10819
06:41:49,380 --> 06:41:49,560
that.

10820
06:41:49,760 --> 06:41:49,880
Okay.

10821
06:41:49,980 --> 06:41:50,860
I'm already feeling it.

10822
06:41:51,200 --> 06:41:52,700
Oh come on!

10823
06:41:52,860 --> 06:41:53,060
No!

10824
06:41:54,800 --> 06:41:55,840
That was such a mistake.

10825
06:41:55,900 --> 06:41:57,100
I don't know why I ate a piece of sushi.

10826
06:41:57,560 --> 06:41:58,500
I don't even know why.

10827
06:41:58,960 --> 06:41:59,960
Is it just one sushi?

10828
06:42:00,200 --> 06:42:00,760
Oh, they went moon.

10829
06:42:00,780 --> 06:42:01,600
They're running the moon?

10830
06:42:02,320 --> 06:42:03,840
Wait, I don't know if we should run.

10831
06:42:04,080 --> 06:42:04,280
Okay.

10832
06:42:05,020 --> 06:42:06,880
It's a little concerning for the low key.

10833
06:42:08,680 --> 06:42:10,000
You gotta split your clones up a little.

10834
06:42:10,460 --> 06:42:11,140
Nevermind, I missed.

10835
06:42:11,660 --> 06:42:14,220
Worst comes to worst, if this is a big problem I can go cloak dagger.

10836
06:42:14,620 --> 06:42:15,560
Oh wait, no wait.

10837
06:42:15,660 --> 06:42:17,060
I can just go Psylocke in one shot.

10838
06:42:17,320 --> 06:42:17,620
Okay.

10839
06:42:17,980 --> 06:42:18,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10840
06:42:18,380 --> 06:42:19,080
Go Psylocke, go Psylocke.

10841
06:42:20,080 --> 06:42:21,620
Oh actually, well, I'm already on.

10842
06:42:21,900 --> 06:42:22,680
I'm already too deep in.

10843
06:42:23,380 --> 06:42:23,600
Yeah.

10844
06:42:24,700 --> 06:42:25,500
You're blocked off.

10845
06:42:26,300 --> 06:42:26,580
Yep.

10846
06:42:27,660 --> 06:42:28,400
I have ult soon.

10847
06:42:28,840 --> 06:42:29,080
Okay.

10848
06:42:30,360 --> 06:42:31,000
I'll give you orb.

10849
06:42:31,100 --> 06:42:32,420
Let me know when you're ulting and I'll give you orb.

10850
06:42:34,820 --> 06:42:35,100
Alright.

10851
06:42:35,840 --> 06:42:36,080
I'm pulling.

10852
06:42:36,700 --> 06:42:37,220
Oh my god!

10853
06:42:37,920 --> 06:42:38,600
Oh my god!

10854
06:42:38,640 --> 06:42:38,980
Look at the group!

10855
06:42:39,140 --> 06:42:39,760
The mag, the mag, the mag!

10856
06:42:40,240 --> 06:42:41,300
I'm looking at mag, I'm looking at mag.

10857
06:42:42,800 --> 06:42:43,820
Wait, I wanna go ult there.

10858
06:42:44,460 --> 06:42:45,080
Nevermind, no I don't.

10859
06:42:46,340 --> 06:42:46,660
I'm doing it again.

10860
06:42:46,680 --> 06:42:47,740
Don't link if you can, don't link if you can!

10861
06:42:47,880 --> 06:42:49,000
Holy shit, thank you for the shield.

10862
06:42:49,980 --> 06:42:51,060
I needed to solo link there.

10863
06:42:52,400 --> 06:42:53,380
I don't have it, sorry.

10864
06:42:55,680 --> 06:42:58,840
I have ult here.

10865
06:43:01,380 --> 06:43:02,380
Actually, you know what?

10866
06:43:03,040 --> 06:43:05,540
Yeah, give me snowflake and I flank behind.

10867
06:43:05,860 --> 06:43:06,580
Yeah, I know.

10868
06:43:06,920 --> 06:43:07,300
Where are you?

10869
06:43:09,020 --> 06:43:09,420
Here.

10870
06:43:10,180 --> 06:43:10,560
Right here?

10871
06:43:12,640 --> 06:43:13,300
Left building.

10872
06:43:13,620 --> 06:43:14,740
Can I ult in first?

10873
06:43:14,840 --> 06:43:15,700
Yeah, just ult in first.

10874
06:43:18,660 --> 06:43:20,020
I'm behind you, I'm behind you.

10875
06:43:20,380 --> 06:43:20,900
I'm right here.

10876
06:43:21,060 --> 06:43:22,520
Yup, I'm ulting, I'm going in.

10877
06:43:28,800 --> 06:43:30,120
Look for rez, Lime, are you active?

10878
06:43:30,260 --> 06:43:30,520
No!

10879
06:43:30,920 --> 06:43:32,100
That damage boost, bro!

10880
06:43:32,400 --> 06:43:33,340
That damage boost!

10881
06:43:38,290 --> 06:43:40,550
Look for rez here, look for rez here, Lime.

10882
06:43:40,670 --> 06:43:41,270
I don't have one yet.

10883
06:43:49,370 --> 06:43:50,430
I'm back, baby!

10884
06:43:51,410 --> 06:43:52,110
Hey, what's up?

10885
06:43:53,830 --> 06:43:55,030
I got shipped, I got shipped to you.

10886
06:43:55,850 --> 06:43:56,850
We're caught up in that room.

10887
06:43:59,890 --> 06:44:00,210
Nice.

10888
06:44:00,210 --> 06:44:01,270
I got you, Doki.

10889
06:44:01,530 --> 06:44:02,210
Thank you.

10890
06:44:04,810 --> 06:44:06,170
We're one off, we're one off, we're one off.

10891
06:44:06,270 --> 06:44:06,910
We're fine, we're fine now.

10892
06:44:07,150 --> 06:44:07,990
Okay, we're good now, we're back.

10893
06:44:07,990 --> 06:44:08,090
We're in the back.

10894
06:44:09,010 --> 06:44:09,330
Nice.

10895
06:44:10,390 --> 06:44:11,250
Oh, just a minute.

10896
06:44:11,250 --> 06:44:12,850
Okay, he's big, he's big, he's big.

10897
06:44:12,870 --> 06:44:13,970
Fruit low, fruit low, fruit low!

10898
06:44:14,750 --> 06:44:16,290
Yeah, I'm on Groot, on Groot, on Groot right now.

10899
06:44:16,530 --> 06:44:16,750
He's dead.

10900
06:44:17,370 --> 06:44:17,730
Back one.

10901
06:44:18,150 --> 06:44:18,690
Got back.

10902
06:44:19,350 --> 06:44:20,090
Loki on the point.

10903
06:44:20,230 --> 06:44:20,550
Got Loki.

10904
06:44:20,770 --> 06:44:20,890
Dead.

10905
06:44:21,030 --> 06:44:21,190
Yeah.

10906
06:44:21,770 --> 06:44:22,450
Okay, good shit.

10907
06:44:24,110 --> 06:44:25,390
I love playing Hello.

10908
06:44:26,350 --> 06:44:26,670
Okay.

10909
06:44:27,470 --> 06:44:28,110
I hate it.

10910
06:44:28,110 --> 06:44:30,110
Playing Hello with a sushi stomach.

10911
06:44:30,750 --> 06:44:31,030
Yep.

10912
06:44:31,590 --> 06:44:32,390
Here, here, snowflake.

10913
06:44:32,630 --> 06:44:32,850
I'll give you snowflake.

10914
06:44:32,910 --> 06:44:33,710
I'll give you snowflake, yeah.

10915
06:44:34,030 --> 06:44:34,770
Actually, it's not that bad.

10916
06:44:35,470 --> 06:44:36,230
Maybe my stomach's fine.

10917
06:44:36,650 --> 06:44:37,570
Don't say that, don't say that.

10918
06:44:37,570 --> 06:44:39,370
You just need the eggs to get the fuck out of there.

10919
06:44:39,830 --> 06:44:40,090
I don't know.

10920
06:44:41,490 --> 06:44:42,830
Push down the eggs with the fish.

10921
06:44:43,610 --> 06:44:44,250
Hello on the left.

10922
06:44:44,550 --> 06:44:45,750
Oh, they have Hello too, they have Hello too.

10923
06:44:45,930 --> 06:44:46,630
Yeah, Hello on the left.

10924
06:44:48,610 --> 06:44:49,010
She's there.

10925
06:44:53,080 --> 06:44:54,040
We're on two to two now.

10926
06:44:59,730 --> 06:45:00,210
You on me, you on me?

10927
06:45:00,330 --> 06:45:00,710
You good?

10928
06:45:02,510 --> 06:45:03,450
I'm dying.

10929
06:45:05,470 --> 06:45:06,450
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10930
06:45:07,450 --> 06:45:08,390
I have ult here.

10931
06:45:08,490 --> 06:45:12,730
I have ult here, if I find it.

10932
06:45:14,190 --> 06:45:14,590
That's good.

10933
06:45:14,790 --> 06:45:14,990
Okay.

10934
06:45:15,930 --> 06:45:16,530
Walled off.

10935
06:45:17,230 --> 06:45:17,530
Got one.

10936
06:45:18,510 --> 06:45:20,390
They're gonna have Brutal, they have Brutal.

10937
06:45:21,970 --> 06:45:22,990
Gonna ult after.

10938
06:45:23,490 --> 06:45:24,150
I'm gonna ult.

10939
06:45:24,590 --> 06:45:25,530
I'm here, I'm going in.

10940
06:45:26,250 --> 06:45:26,730
Nice.

10941
06:45:29,950 --> 06:45:31,830
No, no burn Hella, no burn Hella.

10942
06:45:32,510 --> 06:45:32,610
Got it.

10943
06:45:33,370 --> 06:45:33,830
Got her.

10944
06:45:34,090 --> 06:45:35,130
I've got no soul link.

10945
06:45:35,410 --> 06:45:36,890
Look, he's dead, everyone's dead.

10946
06:45:37,010 --> 06:45:37,590
All of them are dead.

10947
06:45:38,370 --> 06:45:38,790
Alright, there you go.

10948
06:45:39,890 --> 06:45:40,890
I'm pushing for you.

10949
06:45:43,150 --> 06:45:44,430
Fucking building, let me go.

10950
06:45:49,230 --> 06:45:50,090
Don't wall, don't wall.

10951
06:45:54,870 --> 06:45:56,170
We got Moon, they have Moon.

10952
06:45:56,310 --> 06:45:57,210
Save your soul link for that.

10953
06:46:01,280 --> 06:46:02,900
Sorry, I used it for the Groot ult.

10954
06:46:03,820 --> 06:46:04,480
I got you.

10955
06:46:04,840 --> 06:46:05,580
I'm low, I'm low.

10956
06:46:05,580 --> 06:46:07,080
I gave you Snowflake, I gave you Snowflake, Gomez.

10957
06:46:09,160 --> 06:46:11,060
They have Moon and I ult, they have Moon and I ult.

10958
06:46:13,480 --> 06:46:14,420
Oh my gosh.

10959
06:46:14,680 --> 06:46:15,920
I froze Mace, I froze him.

10960
06:46:20,060 --> 06:46:20,860
That's good, that's good.

10961
06:46:20,900 --> 06:46:21,940
They don't have support ults now.

10962
06:46:25,400 --> 06:46:27,520
I'm staying way back so I can rez you if he doesn't ult.

10963
06:46:27,620 --> 06:46:28,240
Yes, yes, yes.

10964
06:46:28,380 --> 06:46:30,220
Groot, Groot, Groot, focus Groot.

10965
06:46:31,100 --> 06:46:34,180
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

10966
06:46:35,200 --> 06:46:35,880
Oh shit, shit up.

10967
06:46:36,200 --> 06:46:37,020
We couldn't see you, sorry.

10968
06:46:39,000 --> 06:46:39,360
Alright,

10969
06:46:44,630 --> 06:46:46,970
Gomez and I are pushed up just to make sure they don't push into us.

10970
06:46:52,240 --> 06:46:53,160
It's okay, that's okay.

10971
06:46:53,580 --> 06:46:55,140
You died right now, it's fine.

10972
06:46:58,100 --> 06:47:00,180
They still have Moon and I ult here.

10973
06:47:01,600 --> 06:47:02,440
Oh shit, door's shutting.

10974
06:47:05,820 --> 06:47:07,840
That's it, that's it, they wasted low heal.

10975
06:47:09,120 --> 06:47:10,440
That's fine, they wasted ult, they wasted ult.

10976
06:47:10,460 --> 06:47:12,800
Yeah, yeah, back out again, don't push into this.

10977
06:47:14,020 --> 06:47:16,040
I'm gonna give Snowflake to Gomez.

10978
06:47:18,520 --> 06:47:20,600
I have ult here, I can get onto site.

10979
06:47:22,980 --> 06:47:23,400
Let's pull.

10980
06:47:24,140 --> 06:47:25,060
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

10981
06:47:25,160 --> 06:47:26,080
You can push in, push in.

10982
06:47:26,900 --> 06:47:27,500
Did they Groot?

10983
06:47:28,340 --> 06:47:30,680
Yeah, let's pull, let's walk in, let's walk in, let's walk in, let's walk in.

10984
06:47:31,820 --> 06:47:32,440
I'm healing.

10985
06:47:32,660 --> 06:47:33,860
There's a mag, there's a mag.

10986
06:47:33,860 --> 06:47:35,300
Healing, healing.

10987
06:47:38,740 --> 06:47:39,700
I tried to shift.

10988
06:47:39,780 --> 06:47:40,620
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

10989
06:47:40,880 --> 06:47:41,600
I have ult here.

10990
06:47:41,620 --> 06:47:42,420
They ult, they ult, they ult.

10991
06:47:42,420 --> 06:47:43,140
I have ult here, nice.

10992
06:47:43,780 --> 06:47:45,320
That's enormous, holy fuck.

10993
06:47:45,640 --> 06:47:47,080
Enormous, enormous, bro.

10994
06:47:49,240 --> 06:47:49,560
Nice.

10995
06:47:51,600 --> 06:47:52,040
Got it.

10996
06:47:52,040 --> 06:47:52,360
Nice.

10997
06:47:53,320 --> 06:47:54,580
Okay, three cart, three cart, three cart.

10998
06:47:54,880 --> 06:47:56,240
Excellent res, excellent res.

10999
06:47:56,240 --> 06:47:57,060
That was a really good res, yeah.

11000
06:47:58,400 --> 06:48:00,680
We don't have anything now, we just gotta build it up now.

11001
06:48:00,700 --> 06:48:01,040
I have an idea.

11002
06:48:02,380 --> 06:48:02,860
What's the idea?

11003
06:48:02,860 --> 06:48:04,980
I get nervous every time you say that.

11004
06:48:04,980 --> 06:48:07,300
Every time he says that he fucking dies, I don't trust it anymore.

11005
06:48:07,300 --> 06:48:07,600
I can't.

11006
06:48:08,300 --> 06:48:11,820
Remember when I gave the idea for him to go, hello, and look at him now.

11007
06:48:12,000 --> 06:48:13,240
He said I was wrong.

11008
06:48:13,660 --> 06:48:14,180
Oh, oh no.

11009
06:48:14,660 --> 06:48:15,440
I got you.

11010
06:48:17,740 --> 06:48:18,100
Fear.

11011
06:48:21,220 --> 06:48:22,340
I fear, I fear.

11012
06:48:22,380 --> 06:48:23,060
I'm okay, I'm okay.

11013
06:48:23,280 --> 06:48:24,700
What the fuck, you threw it at me?

11014
06:48:26,160 --> 06:48:27,940
The fuck is your problem, man?

11015
06:48:28,940 --> 06:48:29,660
Ult in the backline.

11016
06:48:31,460 --> 06:48:32,400
It's okay, it's okay.

11017
06:48:32,400 --> 06:48:33,760
I'm still pushing up, I'm still pushing up.

11018
06:48:33,940 --> 06:48:35,680
Oh, I got revived, I got revived, I got revived.

11019
06:48:35,840 --> 06:48:36,500
I'm back, Hela back here.

11020
06:48:36,620 --> 06:48:36,760
Oh, I'm done.

11021
06:48:38,020 --> 06:48:39,340
Oh, right, the Lucio revived.

11022
06:48:39,740 --> 06:48:40,180
That's a thing.

11023
06:48:41,900 --> 06:48:42,080
Oh.

11024
06:48:42,960 --> 06:48:43,300
LeBron!

11025
06:48:43,600 --> 06:48:44,060
Got it!

11026
06:48:44,700 --> 06:48:46,060
LeBron James, bro.

11027
06:48:46,320 --> 06:48:47,220
Holy shit.

11028
06:48:50,060 --> 06:48:51,900
Mace is making eyes at Doki, I don't like it.

11029
06:48:52,040 --> 06:48:53,960
I know, me too, I don't like it, I feel very uncomfortable.

11030
06:48:53,960 --> 06:48:54,620
Hela can't move!

11031
06:48:55,740 --> 06:48:56,720
Hela the bird, got it!

11032
06:49:00,060 --> 06:49:01,740
Okay, we're good, we're good.

11033
06:49:01,820 --> 06:49:03,340
Crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit, crit!

11034
06:49:05,380 --> 06:49:05,980
Crit, crit!

11035
06:49:06,420 --> 06:49:07,480
Oh no, that's unlucky.

11036
06:49:09,540 --> 06:49:11,060
Me too, me too, I'm ready for it.

11037
06:49:11,340 --> 06:49:13,000
They have Muna on shield for everybody.

11038
06:49:13,280 --> 06:49:15,240
I have ult for this, I have ult after, I have ult after.

11039
06:49:16,280 --> 06:49:16,800
Where are you?

11040
06:49:16,840 --> 06:49:17,400
I don't see you.

11041
06:49:18,880 --> 06:49:20,200
I got hit by it.

11042
06:49:20,680 --> 06:49:21,940
I still get 12% to ult.

11043
06:49:22,560 --> 06:49:22,840
Okay.

11044
06:49:23,460 --> 06:49:24,360
This is our last fight.

11045
06:49:26,280 --> 06:49:27,260
We have Rez.

11046
06:49:27,560 --> 06:49:29,020
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

11047
06:49:29,020 --> 06:49:31,480
As the moment someone dies, you have to Rez.

11048
06:49:31,880 --> 06:49:32,400
I'm real low!

11049
06:49:33,460 --> 06:49:35,020
You have to Rez, you have to Rez.

11050
06:49:40,030 --> 06:49:40,970
I think I made it.

11051
06:49:41,770 --> 06:49:42,690
Mek's coming, Mek's coming.

11052
06:49:42,850 --> 06:49:43,650
That's gonna suck.

11053
06:49:45,130 --> 06:49:45,890
Bonded, I got it.

11054
06:49:46,090 --> 06:49:49,010
Oh my god, nice, nice bonding, nice healing, oh my god.

11055
06:49:49,370 --> 06:49:50,070
Walk, walk, walk.

11056
06:49:50,390 --> 06:49:50,910
Walk, walk, walk.

11057
06:49:51,010 --> 06:49:51,570
We walk, we walk.

11058
06:49:53,470 --> 06:49:54,150
Hela on the side.

11059
06:49:54,530 --> 06:49:54,950
Oh my god.

11060
06:49:54,970 --> 06:49:55,910
She's here, she's high.

11061
06:49:58,310 --> 06:49:58,990
She's still on the side.

11062
06:49:59,270 --> 06:50:00,130
Hela's inside, Hela's inside!

11063
06:50:00,150 --> 06:50:00,910
I'm shifting, I'm shifting.

11064
06:50:05,390 --> 06:50:05,710
Alright.

11065
06:50:06,190 --> 06:50:07,230
No fucking way.

11066
06:50:08,950 --> 06:50:09,930
Get walled up, get walled up.

11067
06:50:09,950 --> 06:50:10,970
I'm trapped in here, I'm trapped.

11068
06:50:11,090 --> 06:50:11,670
Hela over here.

11069
06:50:12,110 --> 06:50:13,490
She's, yeah, she's been over there for a bit.

11070
06:50:13,790 --> 06:50:14,010
Okay.

11071
06:50:14,610 --> 06:50:15,650
Can you get her, can you get her?

11072
06:50:15,950 --> 06:50:16,270
Killmiss!

11073
06:50:19,390 --> 06:50:20,030
Is that...

11074
06:50:20,030 --> 06:50:20,650
You only have...

11075
06:50:20,650 --> 06:50:21,350
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

11076
06:50:21,550 --> 06:50:22,270
Nothing for Coney.

11077
06:50:23,350 --> 06:50:23,610
Okay.

11078
06:50:25,830 --> 06:50:26,790
Look, you can copy.

11079
06:50:28,770 --> 06:50:30,110
Oh, I died, I died.

11080
06:50:30,930 --> 06:50:31,850
I need a Rez or something.

11081
06:50:32,050 --> 06:50:32,350
I can ult.

11082
06:50:32,350 --> 06:50:33,190
No, we're dead.

11083
06:50:34,070 --> 06:50:34,250
Okay.

11084
06:50:36,150 --> 06:50:36,690
On wait.

11085
06:50:37,770 --> 06:50:39,430
Wait a second, wait, wait, wait.

11086
06:50:40,030 --> 06:50:40,670
Oh my god.

11087
06:50:42,470 --> 06:50:44,070
I was gonna say, you still dropped cart.

11088
06:50:44,230 --> 06:50:45,070
Oh my god.

11089
06:50:45,490 --> 06:50:46,150
It didn't matter.

11090
06:50:47,150 --> 06:50:50,450
Yeah, it was because there was a Hela to our left, but no one could challenge that Hela.

11091
06:50:50,910 --> 06:50:51,130
Yeah.

11092
06:50:51,910 --> 06:50:53,110
I was waiting for a Snowflake.

11093
06:50:53,290 --> 06:50:54,030
I should have ulted earlier.

11094
06:50:54,030 --> 06:50:56,910
Yeah, you should have, yeah, I was in the zone there, I couldn't, I didn't know.

11095
06:50:56,930 --> 06:50:58,070
All we gotta do is hold, it's fine.

11096
06:50:58,150 --> 06:50:58,970
We almost got the point.

11097
06:50:59,730 --> 06:51:00,730
Sue her at him for hold.

11098
06:51:02,690 --> 06:51:03,010
Hmm.

11099
06:51:04,810 --> 06:51:06,010
I don't know, I like the Sue, but at the same time the Rez.

11100
06:51:06,010 --> 06:51:08,850
There's a bit of verticality, so I can get a fun Rez, I guess.

11101
06:51:09,390 --> 06:51:11,590
Hmm, I like the Rez.

11102
06:51:11,970 --> 06:51:12,230
Okay.

11103
06:51:15,150 --> 06:51:17,110
If it feels like we're getting steamrolled, I can switch.

11104
06:51:17,430 --> 06:51:19,070
Yeah, if it doesn't work, just go Sue.

11105
06:51:22,780 --> 06:51:23,540
Okay, no work.

11106
06:51:23,800 --> 06:51:27,100
I mean, suing a Hela is kinda OP, though.

11107
06:51:28,260 --> 06:51:29,300
But also, Rez is big.

11108
06:51:30,440 --> 06:51:31,000
What do you want?

11109
06:51:31,200 --> 06:51:31,740
Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.

11110
06:51:32,700 --> 06:51:33,460
Do Sue, do Sue.

11111
06:51:33,460 --> 06:51:33,900
Sue?

11112
06:51:34,040 --> 06:51:34,260
Okay.

11113
06:51:34,460 --> 06:51:35,460
Yeah, it's just Snowflake.

11114
06:51:39,480 --> 06:51:41,380
Is there a Hela getting Snowflake or no?

11115
06:51:43,300 --> 06:51:44,440
I don't think so.

11116
06:51:44,600 --> 06:51:44,760
Okay.

11117
06:51:45,620 --> 06:51:46,780
I'll just keep it on you.

11118
06:51:47,280 --> 06:51:49,460
I would assume why they wouldn't do it, but...

11119
06:51:50,360 --> 06:51:52,640
I think they can put the Snowflake on Mace, because he's their strongest.

11120
06:51:54,180 --> 06:51:54,700
Nah, probably.

11121
06:52:00,030 --> 06:52:02,490
How long until detonation on my right click is like 30 seconds, right?

11122
06:52:03,190 --> 06:52:04,670
I have no idea, you're the pro.

11123
06:52:06,270 --> 06:52:07,090
Okay, I got it.

11124
06:52:08,190 --> 06:52:09,310
I'll shoot it.

11125
06:52:11,990 --> 06:52:12,790
Fuck it.

11126
06:52:13,530 --> 06:52:14,030
I'm getting out.

11127
06:52:18,870 --> 06:52:20,950
Oh, fuck, I need help, I need help, I need help.

11128
06:52:21,790 --> 06:52:22,310
You're fine.

11129
06:52:23,030 --> 06:52:24,350
I didn't even know that bridge could be broken.

11130
06:52:25,050 --> 06:52:25,570
Am I stupid?

11131
06:52:26,690 --> 06:52:28,090
Maybe, I mean, you're sick.

11132
06:52:30,010 --> 06:52:31,130
I guess I'm stupid.

11133
06:52:31,530 --> 06:52:31,850
I'm lucky.

11134
06:52:32,210 --> 06:52:33,710
They are so aggressive, holy shit.

11135
06:52:34,030 --> 06:52:34,390
They are?

11136
06:52:34,390 --> 06:52:34,490
Yeah.

11137
06:52:34,750 --> 06:52:35,490
I hear Hela.

11138
06:52:35,690 --> 06:52:37,010
Hela to your left, Hela here.

11139
06:52:37,770 --> 06:52:39,370
Gomez, Gomez, Hela here, Hela here.

11140
06:52:39,710 --> 06:52:41,710
I couldn't heal because of the Hela.

11141
06:52:42,090 --> 06:52:42,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

11142
06:52:44,410 --> 06:52:45,350
Ah, fuck man.

11143
06:52:45,690 --> 06:52:48,430
I bet he's very good distracting.

11144
06:52:48,610 --> 06:52:49,550
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low, I'm real low.

11145
06:52:49,590 --> 06:52:50,330
I'm trying, we're trying.

11146
06:52:50,510 --> 06:52:50,830
Shielding.

11147
06:52:52,270 --> 06:52:52,810
I'm having to jump.

11148
06:52:52,870 --> 06:52:53,830
This Mace guy is chasing me.

11149
06:52:55,570 --> 06:52:58,170
Oh shit, they're gonna run us over here.

11150
06:52:58,410 --> 06:52:58,770
Yeah.

11151
06:52:59,030 --> 06:53:01,370
Dude, he's hard focusing you, holy shit.

11152
06:53:02,030 --> 06:53:03,670
Gomez, you have to look for the Hela flank.

11153
06:53:04,390 --> 06:53:05,610
Our supports can't heal.

11154
06:53:06,210 --> 06:53:07,270
We need to deal with that.

11155
06:53:07,390 --> 06:53:09,750
Well, that sucks because the left side is my left ear.

11156
06:53:10,370 --> 06:53:11,310
So I couldn't hear it.

11157
06:53:11,750 --> 06:53:12,810
Are you sure Namor isn't the end?

11158
06:53:12,830 --> 06:53:14,250
They went off triple support.

11159
06:53:14,330 --> 06:53:15,130
Yeah, go for it, go for it.

11160
06:53:16,610 --> 06:53:18,590
But you're gonna have to go ult spawn, I think.

11161
06:53:19,310 --> 06:53:20,170
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

11162
06:53:20,690 --> 06:53:23,510
I have, uh...

11163
06:53:26,340 --> 06:53:29,720
Because they swapped off triple heal, so this might be better.

11164
06:53:36,620 --> 06:53:38,620
God, I fucking suck at the E kills.

11165
06:53:41,360 --> 06:53:43,300
They're gonna have Grill here, they're gonna have Grill here.

11166
06:53:44,920 --> 06:53:49,600
No, do not use, do not use your shield for, uh, for that.

11167
06:53:50,900 --> 06:53:51,180
Okay.

11168
06:53:51,940 --> 06:53:52,660
I have to.

11169
06:54:01,510 --> 06:54:03,270
Three, two, one.

11170
06:54:04,950 --> 06:54:06,030
I'm just gonna back up.

11171
06:54:06,790 --> 06:54:07,330
Yeah, back up.

11172
06:54:07,970 --> 06:54:09,570
Yeah, I can't fight their Hela, their Hela has a shield.

11173
06:54:11,210 --> 06:54:11,850
Nevermind, didn't matter.

11174
06:54:12,750 --> 06:54:13,670
Okay, walk, walk, walk.

11175
06:54:13,690 --> 06:54:14,670
Walk, walk, walk, walk, we got this.

11176
06:54:15,710 --> 06:54:16,830
Walking up, walking up.

11177
06:54:17,390 --> 06:54:17,990
Running up.

11178
06:54:19,310 --> 06:54:21,030
Your wall's up, your wall's up, get...

11179
06:54:22,270 --> 06:54:22,770
I'm ulting.

11180
06:54:24,270 --> 06:54:25,190
I don't wanna risk that.

11181
06:54:25,270 --> 06:54:26,210
Oh, we used too many ults.

11182
06:54:26,510 --> 06:54:26,610
Oh.

11183
06:54:26,770 --> 06:54:27,070
I'll get you.

11184
06:54:30,570 --> 06:54:32,590
Someone, you gotta, you gotta get rid of the walls.

11185
06:54:33,150 --> 06:54:35,650
I can't do much when I have walls in front of me.

11186
06:54:38,570 --> 06:54:39,090
Man.

11187
06:54:39,910 --> 06:54:40,330
Alright.

11188
06:54:42,010 --> 06:54:42,170
Woo!

11189
06:54:42,750 --> 06:54:43,230
Nice.

11190
06:54:44,110 --> 06:54:44,610
Ooh, nice one.

11191
06:54:44,610 --> 06:54:45,630
They have Moon Knight ult here.

11192
06:54:46,410 --> 06:54:48,730
They have Moon Knight ult and they're gonna have, uh...

11193
06:54:49,670 --> 06:54:51,290
They have a... oh, they went lowkey.

11194
06:54:53,450 --> 06:54:54,110
Got you.

11195
06:54:56,710 --> 06:54:57,230
One.

11196
06:54:58,530 --> 06:54:59,510
They're going up here.

11197
06:55:03,450 --> 06:55:04,830
Hela underneath you.

11198
06:55:04,830 --> 06:55:05,750
Oh, in there.

11199
06:55:05,950 --> 06:55:06,390
I see her.

11200
06:55:08,090 --> 06:55:09,090
She's in that window.

11201
06:55:10,450 --> 06:55:11,690
Walled off, Coney, walled off, Coney.

11202
06:55:12,550 --> 06:55:13,030
Yeah, I'm fine.

11203
06:55:13,110 --> 06:55:13,610
Walled off, walled off.

11204
06:55:16,970 --> 06:55:17,970
There's, there's nothing here.

11205
06:55:21,050 --> 06:55:21,890
Any heal up here?

11206
06:55:22,710 --> 06:55:23,730
Uh, the healer's dead.

11207
06:55:24,270 --> 06:55:25,010
I'm still alive, it's fine.

11208
06:55:25,170 --> 06:55:26,110
No, Doki's alive, Doki's alive.

11209
06:55:26,110 --> 06:55:26,270
Yeah.

11210
06:55:26,650 --> 06:55:27,770
It's fine, I have ult too.

11211
06:55:27,950 --> 06:55:28,490
I got two.

11212
06:55:30,490 --> 06:55:31,730
I got you, I got you, mate.

11213
06:55:31,890 --> 06:55:32,570
Uh, no, wait, sorry.

11214
06:55:33,430 --> 06:55:33,750
No!

11215
06:55:34,490 --> 06:55:34,890
What?

11216
06:55:36,570 --> 06:55:37,830
That fucking sucks, eh?

11217
06:55:43,130 --> 06:55:45,330
Do you want me to ult to match the other...

11218
06:55:45,330 --> 06:55:45,710
Missed ult was low.

11219
06:55:46,710 --> 06:55:47,750
Yeah, and Fizz got away.

11220
06:55:48,790 --> 06:55:49,110
Yeah.

11221
06:55:49,490 --> 06:55:50,190
It's okay though.

11222
06:55:51,270 --> 06:55:51,670
Fucks.

11223
06:55:54,900 --> 06:55:55,980
Use your ult, use your ult here!

11224
06:55:56,840 --> 06:55:57,140
Oh.

11225
06:55:59,060 --> 06:55:59,460
Nice.

11226
06:56:04,930 --> 06:56:06,150
You're going to have Moon Knight ult, okay?

11227
06:56:06,330 --> 06:56:06,990
Don't bunch up.

11228
06:56:08,310 --> 06:56:08,710
Mag.

11229
06:56:13,440 --> 06:56:14,620
I need y'all to take some damage.

11230
06:56:14,780 --> 06:56:15,260
Moon Knight dead.

11231
06:56:15,980 --> 06:56:16,700
I need heals.

11232
06:56:16,920 --> 06:56:19,140
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

11233
06:56:25,230 --> 06:56:26,310
Fuck, I don't have shift.

11234
06:56:26,550 --> 06:56:26,990
Fuck me.

11235
06:56:28,190 --> 06:56:29,090
Right here, right here, right here!

11236
06:56:29,270 --> 06:56:29,610
Groot one, Groot one!

11237
06:56:29,750 --> 06:56:30,190
Let's win!

11238
06:56:31,430 --> 06:56:33,010
Oh, the Groot's low, Groot's low, fuck!

11239
06:56:33,210 --> 06:56:33,710
He's still low, yeah.

11240
06:56:34,930 --> 06:56:35,770
I still see him.

11241
06:56:36,110 --> 06:56:36,590
He's still low.

11242
06:56:40,470 --> 06:56:40,950
I got him.

11243
06:56:42,350 --> 06:56:44,230
Three, two, one, at the back out.

11244
06:56:45,110 --> 06:56:45,750
Okay, that's fine.

11245
06:56:45,750 --> 06:56:48,190
I am ready to put on a show!

11246
06:56:49,890 --> 06:56:50,970
I could get that far to you.

11247
06:56:51,050 --> 06:56:52,610
I could, and you were way too far for us.

11248
06:56:53,610 --> 06:56:55,030
I should ult for this.

11249
06:56:57,130 --> 06:56:59,390
We have no support ults, we have no support ults, by the way.

11250
06:57:01,790 --> 06:57:03,130
Yeah, I'll come back with ults then.

11251
06:57:03,710 --> 06:57:05,610
Oh my god, that Hell is low, Hell is low.

11252
06:57:07,270 --> 06:57:07,730
Got you.

11253
06:57:08,270 --> 06:57:09,910
They have Moon Knight ult, they have Moon Knight ult.

11254
06:57:10,010 --> 06:57:10,890
Just try to back them up.

11255
06:57:11,370 --> 06:57:12,130
Just try to back them up.

11256
06:57:13,010 --> 06:57:14,010
I'm ulting to survive.

11257
06:57:14,370 --> 06:57:14,850
I got you, Shen.

11258
06:57:15,390 --> 06:57:16,370
Thank you, thank you.

11259
06:57:17,710 --> 06:57:18,410
I got you, Doki.

11260
06:57:18,850 --> 06:57:20,730
My ult lasts longer than a super ult, by the way.

11261
06:57:20,990 --> 06:57:21,570
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

11262
06:57:21,650 --> 06:57:22,990
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

11263
06:57:25,410 --> 06:57:26,430
Where are you, Gomez?

11264
06:57:26,650 --> 06:57:28,430
I got you, you have Snowflake, you have Snowflake.

11265
06:57:29,690 --> 06:57:30,590
You can go flank now.

11266
06:57:34,990 --> 06:57:37,670
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11267
06:57:37,830 --> 06:57:38,750
Oh, no, no.

11268
06:57:39,470 --> 06:57:41,390
Never use it, never use it.

11269
06:57:42,310 --> 06:57:43,350
During, during grid ult.

11270
06:57:43,830 --> 06:57:44,630
Like, during, if we had...

11271
06:57:44,630 --> 06:57:45,310
Oh, they have Moon Knight ult.

11272
06:57:47,530 --> 06:57:48,110
Got another one.

11273
06:57:48,370 --> 06:57:49,290
Nice, nice, nice, we're coming back.

11274
06:57:49,610 --> 06:57:50,550
I'm backing up, I am low.

11275
06:57:50,550 --> 06:57:51,470
We're coming back, we're coming back.

11276
06:57:51,550 --> 06:57:52,270
Yeah, wait for us.

11277
06:57:52,410 --> 06:57:52,910
For heals, if we can.

11278
06:57:53,150 --> 06:57:54,230
I tried to jump, but I couldn't.

11279
06:57:54,790 --> 06:57:56,070
I held it as long as I could.

11280
06:57:56,990 --> 06:57:57,790
I can plant point.

11281
06:57:58,050 --> 06:57:58,530
Okay, okay, okay.

11282
06:57:59,430 --> 06:57:59,930
Rune is low.

11283
06:58:00,190 --> 06:58:00,270
Oh, no.

11284
06:58:01,150 --> 06:58:02,390
Oh, none of us have point.

11285
06:58:03,010 --> 06:58:03,910
Sorry, we got two minutes.

11286
06:58:04,030 --> 06:58:04,230
It's fine.

11287
06:58:04,350 --> 06:58:04,950
It's not that...

11288
06:58:04,950 --> 06:58:05,850
It's no time at all.

11289
06:58:06,870 --> 06:58:08,270
I'm backing up fully, I'm backing up fully.

11290
06:58:08,810 --> 06:58:09,510
No, they got me.

11291
06:58:11,390 --> 06:58:12,770
Okay, we know they have Moon Knight ult.

11292
06:58:12,910 --> 06:58:13,910
Don't, don't ult the...

11293
06:58:13,910 --> 06:58:14,790
Don't ult the Groot.

11294
06:58:15,690 --> 06:58:15,830
Okay.

11295
06:58:18,610 --> 06:58:20,550
Back up fully, back up fully, back up fully.

11296
06:58:20,730 --> 06:58:21,770
Oh, they're just gonna free push this.

11297
06:58:22,130 --> 06:58:22,750
Back up fully.

11298
06:58:24,810 --> 06:58:25,910
Beat me up, beat me up here.

11299
06:58:28,430 --> 06:58:29,690
They're gonna have combo again.

11300
06:58:29,830 --> 06:58:30,650
They're gonna have combo again.

11301
06:58:31,750 --> 06:58:31,910
Yeah.

11302
06:58:32,250 --> 06:58:33,390
So, uh...

11303
06:58:33,970 --> 06:58:35,430
I'm gonna try not to bunch up with...

11304
06:58:36,090 --> 06:58:37,330
I give you orb, I give you orb.

11305
06:58:37,530 --> 06:58:40,410
Alright, I'm ready to turn.

11306
06:58:40,690 --> 06:58:41,130
We ready?

11307
06:58:41,370 --> 06:58:41,570
Yeah.

11308
06:58:42,410 --> 06:58:42,770
I'm ready.

11309
06:58:43,070 --> 06:58:43,490
Going in.

11310
06:58:44,370 --> 06:58:45,650
We should push up, we should push up now.

11311
06:58:45,650 --> 06:58:45,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11312
06:58:45,950 --> 06:58:46,570
Yep, that's what I'm doing.

11313
06:58:47,650 --> 06:58:48,410
I'm all going in.

11314
06:58:48,830 --> 06:58:49,090
You're good.

11315
06:58:49,850 --> 06:58:51,430
Oh, there's a Hella on the side, Hella on the side.

11316
06:58:51,750 --> 06:58:52,630
We need help, we need help, Gomez.

11317
06:58:52,730 --> 06:58:53,250
We need to get the Hella.

11318
06:58:54,610 --> 06:58:55,390
I'm going for the back up.

11319
06:58:55,490 --> 06:58:56,310
Oh no, she went...

11320
06:58:56,310 --> 06:58:56,670
She's going around.

11321
06:58:56,710 --> 06:58:58,150
I'm going in, I'm going in with this.

11322
06:58:58,810 --> 06:58:59,070
You got it?

11323
06:58:59,190 --> 06:58:59,730
Okay, okay.

11324
06:59:00,230 --> 06:59:01,310
I'm gonna throw it right now.

11325
06:59:03,110 --> 06:59:04,010
Oh my god, we're here.

11326
06:59:04,110 --> 06:59:04,570
Nice, nice.

11327
06:59:04,590 --> 06:59:04,830
Huge!

11328
06:59:05,030 --> 06:59:05,850
I died.

11329
06:59:05,990 --> 06:59:06,670
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

11330
06:59:07,250 --> 06:59:07,830
No, no, it's fine.

11331
06:59:08,190 --> 06:59:08,590
Good trade.

11332
06:59:10,470 --> 06:59:10,790
Fuck.

11333
06:59:11,330 --> 06:59:12,210
You're on, you're on, you're on.

11334
06:59:12,870 --> 06:59:14,130
He missed, he missed, he missed the girl.

11335
06:59:15,530 --> 06:59:16,630
Nice, no more health, no more.

11336
06:59:16,670 --> 06:59:17,090
Nothing, nothing.

11337
06:59:17,710 --> 06:59:18,210
Nothing, nothing.

11338
06:59:18,270 --> 06:59:18,630
Mag died!

11339
06:59:18,790 --> 06:59:19,130
Mag fell!

11340
06:59:19,930 --> 06:59:21,050
Mag fell off, oh my god.

11341
06:59:21,290 --> 06:59:23,390
He fell off for reset, he fell off for reset.

11342
06:59:23,470 --> 06:59:24,910
Yeah, he's just resetting, he's resetting.

11343
06:59:24,970 --> 06:59:25,890
Oh, he's just resetting?

11344
06:59:26,170 --> 06:59:26,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11345
06:59:26,930 --> 06:59:27,730
They're gonna have...

11346
06:59:27,730 --> 06:59:31,470
They have no Groot combo, but they have Moonlight Health, so...

11347
06:59:31,470 --> 06:59:33,330
Yeah, I'm gonna build my ult really quick.

11348
06:59:33,550 --> 06:59:34,430
He just drilled.

11349
06:59:34,990 --> 06:59:35,310
What?

11350
06:59:36,610 --> 06:59:37,230
No, nothing, nothing.

11351
06:59:38,410 --> 06:59:39,350
I'm gonna ult this, okay?

11352
06:59:39,790 --> 06:59:40,930
I didn't know that was intentional.

11353
06:59:42,950 --> 06:59:45,030
They have Moonlight Ult, they have Moonlight Ult.

11354
06:59:45,970 --> 06:59:47,890
I'm not standing near all of you guys.

11355
06:59:47,950 --> 06:59:49,230
I'm gonna try and get my ult as quickly as possible.

11356
06:59:49,290 --> 06:59:50,210
I'm gonna hide over here.

11357
06:59:50,990 --> 06:59:53,190
Dude, they're getting destroyed up there.

11358
06:59:56,370 --> 06:59:57,070
That was one.

11359
06:59:57,710 --> 07:00:01,030
What the fuck?

11360
07:00:01,230 --> 07:00:01,430
Okay.

11361
07:00:03,270 --> 07:00:04,630
No, I got it, I got it.

11362
07:00:06,270 --> 07:00:08,530
You can use your ult here, you can use your ult here.

11363
07:00:08,530 --> 07:00:09,010
Fine.

11364
07:00:11,070 --> 07:00:11,430
Thank you.

11365
07:00:11,570 --> 07:00:12,570
Good job, good job, good job.

11366
07:00:12,670 --> 07:00:13,370
I'm ulting behind them.

11367
07:00:13,750 --> 07:00:14,450
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

11368
07:00:14,470 --> 07:00:15,290
Big ult, big ult, big ult.

11369
07:00:15,350 --> 07:00:15,910
Go, go, go, go.

11370
07:00:16,130 --> 07:00:16,870
Walk, walk, walk, walk.

11371
07:00:18,130 --> 07:00:19,210
Just walk, just walk, just walk.

11372
07:00:23,940 --> 07:00:25,920
Mesa's one, Mesa's one, Mesa's one, Mesa's one, Mesa's one.

11373
07:00:26,320 --> 07:00:27,380
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

11374
07:00:29,460 --> 07:00:30,240
Lucky's dead, Lucky's dead.

11375
07:00:34,960 --> 07:00:35,440
Nice, nice.

11376
07:00:35,580 --> 07:00:36,860
No, he got him, we got him, we got him.

11377
07:00:36,900 --> 07:00:37,920
We got it, we got it, okay.

11378
07:00:38,120 --> 07:00:39,460
Oh my god, we did it!

11379
07:00:39,800 --> 07:00:40,040
Nice!

11380
07:00:40,040 --> 07:00:41,100
Come on, guys.

11381
07:00:42,520 --> 07:00:43,400
Holy shit.

11382
07:00:43,860 --> 07:00:44,280
Oh my god, first place!

11383
07:00:44,320 --> 07:00:44,980
We win it!

11384
07:00:45,000 --> 07:00:45,560
First place!

11385
07:00:48,100 --> 07:00:48,920
Good shit.

11386
07:00:49,080 --> 07:00:50,340
Oh my god.

11387
07:00:50,460 --> 07:00:51,680
Good job, guys.

11388
07:00:53,060 --> 07:00:53,540
Oh my god.

11389
07:00:54,460 --> 07:00:55,200
Good job, kid.

11390
07:00:55,200 --> 07:00:55,760
We got it.

11391
07:00:55,800 --> 07:00:57,240
We got it, first place.

11392
07:00:59,080 --> 07:01:00,060
Oh my god, bro.

11393
07:01:00,060 --> 07:01:00,980
Oh my god, man.

11394
07:01:01,040 --> 07:01:03,340
Oh, if I had got that kill, I think we would have lost.

11395
07:01:05,040 --> 07:01:06,560
Yeah, that was a big kill there.

11396
07:01:06,740 --> 07:01:08,340
That was a huge kill there.

11397
07:01:08,500 --> 07:01:08,940
Yeah.

11398
07:01:08,940 --> 07:01:11,240
That shit was scary.

11399
07:01:11,260 --> 07:01:14,480
Yeah, no, when I pinged my last fight, I was so fucking scared.

11400
07:01:14,860 --> 07:01:17,040
I didn't realize she saw me.

11401
07:01:18,400 --> 07:01:19,340
Oh my god, dude.

11402
07:01:19,720 --> 07:01:20,740
Oh my god.

11403
07:01:20,740 --> 07:01:22,700
Sorry for the old goofs, but we did so good.

11404
07:01:23,000 --> 07:01:23,980
No, it's alright, we did it!

11405
07:01:24,540 --> 07:01:25,420
Yeah, we still made it work.

11406
07:01:25,480 --> 07:01:26,500
We made it work!

11407
07:01:27,240 --> 07:01:27,900
We did it!

11408
07:01:28,360 --> 07:01:28,400
3-0!

11409
07:01:28,720 --> 07:01:31,440
3-0!

11410
07:01:32,560 --> 07:01:34,020
Dude, good job, everybody.

11411
07:01:36,100 --> 07:01:38,840
I'm so happy to play with all of you guys.

11412
07:01:38,940 --> 07:01:40,700
That's a good way, that's so cool.

11413
07:01:40,700 --> 07:01:42,260
We went on a training arc and we succeeded.

11414
07:01:42,560 --> 07:01:43,440
We did it!

11415
07:01:43,660 --> 07:01:45,940
I get to eat duck, oh my god, I get to eat duck.

11416
07:01:46,060 --> 07:01:48,760
Oh my god, you gotta tweet that picture out, dude.

11417
07:01:48,760 --> 07:01:50,040
I'm gonna live through you.

11418
07:01:51,640 --> 07:01:53,240
Winner, champion, duck.

11419
07:01:53,700 --> 07:01:55,660
Right there.

11420
07:01:55,780 --> 07:01:56,940
That was intense.

11421
07:01:58,400 --> 07:01:59,160
That was, yeah.

11422
07:01:59,820 --> 07:02:01,560
How much damage did Gomez...

11423
07:02:01,560 --> 07:02:02,940
42 kills!

11424
07:02:04,100 --> 07:02:05,060
Holy fuck.

11425
07:02:05,060 --> 07:02:10,100
Oh my god, Bettle almost matched Gomez's damage, look at that.

11426
07:02:11,320 --> 07:02:12,220
Yeah, he went crazy.

11427
07:02:12,340 --> 07:02:14,200
Oh my god, Bettle, you went...

11428
07:02:14,200 --> 07:02:16,500
Dude, Bettle was insane as well.

11429
07:02:16,760 --> 07:02:18,080
The Maggles were nuts.

11430
07:02:18,080 --> 07:02:18,980
They were so good.

11431
07:02:18,980 --> 07:02:19,660
He was getting two.

11432
07:02:19,800 --> 07:02:23,120
I'm glad we banned Strange, I'm so happy we banned him.

11433
07:02:23,460 --> 07:02:25,340
Yeah, I think it would've been rough with Strange.

11434
07:02:25,880 --> 07:02:26,100
Yeah, yeah.

11435
07:02:27,680 --> 07:02:29,640
Dude, good job guys, we fucking did it!

11436
07:02:29,760 --> 07:02:30,920
We did it, yeah!

11437
07:02:32,140 --> 07:02:33,020
G2s, everybody!

11438
07:02:33,020 --> 07:02:35,960
Our two week training art paid off, guys.

11439
07:02:35,960 --> 07:02:37,000
G2s, man.

11440
07:02:37,440 --> 07:02:38,700
Oh my god.

11441
07:02:41,860 --> 07:02:44,160
I'm not playing this game for like two days.

11442
07:02:44,760 --> 07:02:45,860
I'm taking a break.

11443
07:02:46,820 --> 07:02:51,440
I'm decaying in two days, I have to play one ranked match today.

11444
07:02:53,960 --> 07:02:58,060
Oh my god, we are the VTuber champions!

11445
07:02:59,720 --> 07:03:01,920
Every single one of us, a VTuber.

11446
07:03:03,020 --> 07:03:04,480
All of us, all of us.

11447
07:03:08,240 --> 07:03:10,020
I'm so tired, yay.

11448
07:03:10,260 --> 07:03:11,680
Oh my god, me too.

11449
07:03:11,880 --> 07:03:12,700
Oh, I cannot wait.

11450
07:03:12,720 --> 07:03:13,660
I'm not used to waking up this early.

11451
07:03:14,160 --> 07:03:18,880
Me too, I can't wait to sleep till 12pm, like sleep till 2pm again.

11452
07:03:21,540 --> 07:03:24,100
Dude, I'm getting blasted.

11453
07:03:24,740 --> 07:03:25,220
Drinking?

11454
07:03:25,380 --> 07:03:26,580
You're drinking tonight?

11455
07:03:29,040 --> 07:03:30,000
Drink, yeah!

11456
07:03:30,100 --> 07:03:32,360
Bettle, what's it like to win for the first time?

11457
07:03:33,180 --> 07:03:34,400
Oh, it feels good.

11458
07:03:36,440 --> 07:03:37,640
Got a W.

11459
07:03:40,800 --> 07:03:41,700
GGs, guys.

11460
07:03:41,900 --> 07:03:44,780
Those were some fucking insane games.

11461
07:03:47,420 --> 07:03:49,340
Thank you for inviting me.

11462
07:03:49,740 --> 07:03:51,940
Yeah, thank you for inviting me.

11463
07:03:52,520 --> 07:03:54,460
Thank you for inviting me as well.

11464
07:03:54,600 --> 07:03:58,140
Thank you for joining my team.

11465
07:03:59,000 --> 07:04:00,400
We got another tourney?

11466
07:04:00,640 --> 07:04:02,200
Fuck, I have to go to another tourney.

11467
07:04:02,200 --> 07:04:03,280
Wait, right away?

11468
07:04:04,440 --> 07:04:05,860
Is your team next?

11469
07:04:07,100 --> 07:04:08,200
I think so.

11470
07:04:09,540 --> 07:04:10,860
Don't eat any more sushi.

11471
07:04:11,580 --> 07:04:12,600
Don't eat any more sushi.

11472
07:04:12,700 --> 07:04:13,480
I won't, I won't.

11473
07:04:16,840 --> 07:04:18,580
You got another tournament.

11474
07:04:20,300 --> 07:04:21,660
I think you earned it, bro.

11475
07:04:21,720 --> 07:04:23,120
Maybe one more sushi, you know?

11476
07:04:23,180 --> 07:04:24,680
Yeah, just one more sushi.

11477
07:04:24,860 --> 07:04:27,260
Oh, I thought it was done.

11478
07:04:28,520 --> 07:04:29,700
You earned that.

11479
07:04:29,840 --> 07:04:30,740
Eat that sushi.

11480
07:04:30,740 --> 07:04:31,940
Look at our tournament.

11481
07:04:32,520 --> 07:04:33,960
You have like 30 minutes to an hour.

11482
07:04:34,160 --> 07:04:37,080
Okay, so you have 30 minutes to chill.

11483
07:04:38,140 --> 07:04:40,420
Our leaderboard... sorry, our match history looks really good.

11484
07:04:40,760 --> 07:04:41,500
Yeah, oh yeah.

11485
07:04:42,200 --> 07:04:44,440
It's a golden carpet.

11486
07:04:44,720 --> 07:04:46,700
Yeah, we fly golden carpet.

11487
07:04:47,100 --> 07:04:48,120
Oh my god.

11488
07:04:49,860 --> 07:04:50,520
Just don't drink?

11489
07:04:50,620 --> 07:04:51,000
Okay, I won't.

11490
07:04:51,080 --> 07:04:51,760
Look at that.

11491
07:04:52,020 --> 07:04:53,520
Oh my... just don't scroll down, guys.

11492
07:04:53,580 --> 07:04:54,060
Don't scroll down.

11493
07:04:57,760 --> 07:04:58,760
Don't scroll down.

11494
07:04:58,840 --> 07:05:00,020
It looks a little awkward.

11495
07:05:00,020 --> 07:05:01,740
Yes, our games are still there.

11496
07:05:01,780 --> 07:05:02,660
They're still there.

11497
07:05:03,320 --> 07:05:04,780
Union Battles games are still there.

11498
07:05:05,500 --> 07:05:06,720
Late night special.

11499
07:05:07,280 --> 07:05:08,660
Thank you so much again, Doki.

11500
07:05:08,740 --> 07:05:10,500
It's not something I ever thought that I would do.

11501
07:05:10,620 --> 07:05:13,780
Because I get stressed about competition, even though I'm really competitive.

11502
07:05:14,040 --> 07:05:16,000
So it was really nice to know that I can step up and do it.

11503
07:05:16,240 --> 07:05:17,560
No, you did great.

11504
07:05:18,380 --> 07:05:19,240
You did fucking great.

11505
07:05:19,240 --> 07:05:19,840
You did great.

11506
07:05:20,060 --> 07:05:20,980
You had to save some of these games.

11507
07:05:22,260 --> 07:05:23,120
You literally did.

11508
07:05:23,340 --> 07:05:25,440
I remember you had so many good reses, too.

11509
07:05:25,580 --> 07:05:27,220
Yeah, good soul, good soul.

11510
07:05:27,340 --> 07:05:28,760
Thank you so much, everyone.

11511
07:05:28,880 --> 07:05:29,360
It was awesome.

11512
07:05:29,360 --> 07:05:30,800
All of us, and Jay, too.

11513
07:05:30,860 --> 07:05:32,220
Also, he shouted Jay as well.

11514
07:05:32,660 --> 07:05:36,120
He got locked out, so he can't join in the PC.

11515
07:05:37,140 --> 07:05:39,460
I feel like everyone had their game-saving moment.

11516
07:05:40,440 --> 07:05:41,460
Yeah, everybody contributes.

11517
07:05:43,700 --> 07:05:46,960
Every matchup we had, we had someone that did the winning play.

11518
07:05:47,100 --> 07:05:47,720
Like crazy.

11519
07:05:47,860 --> 07:05:49,020
Yeah, that went crazy.

11520
07:05:49,500 --> 07:05:56,600
We did depend on Gomez a little bit, but even when he dies, we still survive without him.

11521
07:05:58,100 --> 07:06:01,860
So, like, we all have, like, sustainability for ourselves.

11522
07:06:02,780 --> 07:06:03,980
Thanks for having me.

11523
07:06:04,160 --> 07:06:08,020
I know my schedule is kind of all over the place, but I'm happy to be here.

11524
07:06:08,980 --> 07:06:10,200
It was amazing.

11525
07:06:11,280 --> 07:06:13,180
The scrims were very helpful, by the way.

11526
07:06:13,260 --> 07:06:13,980
We would not be here without them.

11527
07:06:13,980 --> 07:06:15,200
Yeah, no, 100%.

11528
07:06:15,200 --> 07:06:16,100
I'm glad we scrimmed.

11529
07:06:16,900 --> 07:06:20,320
If we'd just gone in raw, that would've been disastrous, I think.

11530
07:06:20,880 --> 07:06:24,420
Yeah, they just insta-banned Beto's mag, and we're just like, what do we do?

11531
07:06:28,320 --> 07:06:30,660
Yeah, now you can play two characters!

11532
07:06:31,020 --> 07:06:32,080
Look at that!

11533
07:06:33,120 --> 07:06:34,580
It's only up now!

11534
07:06:36,700 --> 07:06:41,460
And if ever you guys ever want to play ranked, it was awesome playing ranked with you as well, so I'm always up for it.

11535
07:06:42,160 --> 07:06:42,560
Absolutely.

11536
07:06:45,980 --> 07:06:48,700
I'm down the game with y'all in private times.

11537
07:06:51,920 --> 07:06:54,560
Can we get Jay in here so we can say we love Jay?

11538
07:06:54,560 --> 07:06:55,720
Yeah, wait, where's Jay?

11539
07:06:55,900 --> 07:06:56,760
Yeah, get Jay in here!

11540
07:06:56,920 --> 07:06:59,900
Who was the VC people?

11541
07:07:00,120 --> 07:07:00,400
I forgot.

11542
07:07:01,120 --> 07:07:03,280
I'm not saying the name again.

11543
07:07:03,400 --> 07:07:03,740
Whitey?

11544
07:07:05,360 --> 07:07:08,360
Can we get Whitey in here to help us?

11545
07:07:09,060 --> 07:07:11,600
You can't call Jay that, Doki.

11546
07:07:11,740 --> 07:07:12,280
That's fucked up.

11547
07:07:15,580 --> 07:07:20,220
Do I need to dox this guy's profile to prove that he's a real person?

11548
07:07:20,220 --> 07:07:22,600
I don't know.

11549
07:07:22,940 --> 07:07:26,420
I swear to God, guys, his name is Whitey.

11550
07:07:26,500 --> 07:07:28,500
I swear to fucking God.

11551
07:07:28,960 --> 07:07:30,220
We are not...

11552
07:07:32,060 --> 07:07:35,140
We're not calling people out for other things.

11553
07:07:35,980 --> 07:07:36,600
Hello?

11554
07:07:37,040 --> 07:07:37,800
Oh, Jay!

11555
07:07:41,320 --> 07:07:42,300
What's up, man?

11556
07:07:43,500 --> 07:07:45,680
You all did so good, bro.

11557
07:07:45,680 --> 07:07:47,140
I was watching the whole time.

11558
07:07:47,380 --> 07:07:48,300
Oh, Jay.

11559
07:07:50,220 --> 07:07:51,080
I'm so stressed.

11560
07:07:51,300 --> 07:07:52,840
Jay, you got us there, too.

11561
07:07:52,980 --> 07:07:54,920
During day one, you got us there.

11562
07:07:55,560 --> 07:07:57,020
Yeah, you did so good, Jay.

11563
07:07:57,120 --> 07:07:57,740
Thank you.

11564
07:07:58,000 --> 07:08:00,660
Oh my God, it's an honor to be able to play with you guys.

11565
07:08:00,840 --> 07:08:01,380
Holy shit.

11566
07:08:02,420 --> 07:08:03,360
Of course, of course.

11567
07:08:03,600 --> 07:08:06,460
Of course, and you also helped train Betel, too.

11568
07:08:07,500 --> 07:08:08,520
What about you?

11569
07:08:08,540 --> 07:08:10,340
I'm sure you did the thing, and I didn't get stronger!

11570
07:08:11,400 --> 07:08:14,880
Yeah, you taught Betel how to fly up and all.

11571
07:08:18,040 --> 07:08:19,600
It's still Betel's hard work.

11572
07:08:20,080 --> 07:08:23,080
Guys, I still have the replay of our old scrims.

11573
07:08:23,900 --> 07:08:31,320
Betel just walking up to them and...

11574
07:08:31,320 --> 07:08:33,140
Let Betel celebrate.

11575
07:08:33,300 --> 07:08:33,840
Let Betel celebrate.

11576
07:08:33,940 --> 07:08:34,460
Don't bring that up.

11577
07:08:35,400 --> 07:08:37,200
Yeah, but now look at you.

11578
07:08:37,420 --> 07:08:38,320
You fly up!

11579
07:08:39,180 --> 07:08:43,720
The ultimate slam dunk would be to show him walking up in MS Paint diagrams.

11580
07:08:45,500 --> 07:08:50,140
With the Dr. Strange PNG, and be like, this is how you used to all.

11581
07:08:53,840 --> 07:08:54,680
Oh, man.

11582
07:08:55,080 --> 07:08:56,720
I'm so proud of all of us.

11583
07:08:56,880 --> 07:08:58,500
I didn't know.

11584
07:08:58,680 --> 07:09:04,240
I felt like we could easily make it to the grand finals, but I didn't know if we were going to get first or second.

11585
07:09:06,060 --> 07:09:07,280
I had faith all along.

11586
07:09:07,760 --> 07:09:11,440
Yeah, I was like, out of 100 plus teams, we got first place, too.

11587
07:09:11,440 --> 07:09:14,140
As we started playing more, I felt more and more confident.

11588
07:09:14,300 --> 07:09:15,200
Yeah, me too.

11589
07:09:15,440 --> 07:09:17,700
Everybody was filling in their roles really well.

11590
07:09:18,860 --> 07:09:20,460
We meshed together really, really well.

11591
07:09:20,460 --> 07:09:21,880
Yeah, we didn't second guess each other.

11592
07:09:22,060 --> 07:09:25,380
Limeo and I, when we first played support together, Limeo would run away from me.

11593
07:09:32,740 --> 07:09:34,680
SoloQ was a different game.

11594
07:09:36,700 --> 07:09:40,000
It's crazy, like half the time I would be like, okay, I'm healing my co-healer.

11595
07:09:40,120 --> 07:09:43,480
Then the enemies would switch to me and the other person would be like, okay, have fun.

11596
07:09:43,580 --> 07:09:44,040
Yeah, good luck.

11597
07:09:46,940 --> 07:09:49,380
Oh, my God, but we did it.

11598
07:09:50,920 --> 07:09:51,720
Congratulations, everybody.

11599
07:09:53,400 --> 07:09:54,600
We did it!

11600
07:09:54,700 --> 07:09:56,040
We did it, first place!

11601
07:09:58,740 --> 07:09:59,540
First place!

11602
07:10:02,280 --> 07:10:02,680
GGs!

11603
07:10:03,280 --> 07:10:03,980
We're the champions!

11604
07:10:05,540 --> 07:10:06,760
We did it.

11605
07:10:06,900 --> 07:10:12,260
If they bring VTuber Rivals 2 again, I wonder if we can come back together as a team.

11606
07:10:13,220 --> 07:10:14,160
Surely they would let us.

11607
07:10:14,160 --> 07:10:15,100
Yeah, surely they would let us.

11608
07:10:15,140 --> 07:10:16,720
We're like the champions.

11609
07:10:18,040 --> 07:10:19,040
The run back.

11610
07:10:19,240 --> 07:10:21,140
The run back, I want the run back.

11611
07:10:22,000 --> 07:10:23,780
I'll know Dr. Doom by then.

11612
07:10:26,640 --> 07:10:31,320
I wonder, wait, what do we get from this?

11613
07:10:31,360 --> 07:10:32,220
It's just the credits, right?

11614
07:10:32,380 --> 07:10:33,460
No, we get actual money.

11615
07:10:35,000 --> 07:10:36,640
Yeah, so each of us get...

11616
07:10:36,640 --> 07:10:37,060
And credits.

11617
07:10:37,360 --> 07:10:40,560
You get $200 worth of credits.

11618
07:10:42,160 --> 07:10:43,240
So you can buy any skins.

11619
07:10:43,380 --> 07:10:44,940
You don't have to buy skins for a while.

11620
07:10:46,400 --> 07:10:48,920
Or if you want to rename your account like a hundred times.

11621
07:10:50,600 --> 07:10:51,980
Yeah, that's an option as well.

11622
07:10:52,000 --> 07:10:52,540
Good idea.

11623
07:10:52,920 --> 07:10:53,860
And also we get cash.

11624
07:10:53,980 --> 07:10:55,920
I think we get $300 each.

11625
07:10:57,380 --> 07:10:58,120
On top of it.

11626
07:10:58,600 --> 07:11:00,200
Yeah, but it could be more because...

11627
07:11:00,200 --> 07:11:01,240
Can I just buy every skin?

11628
07:11:01,820 --> 07:11:02,800
You can, right now.

11629
07:11:02,800 --> 07:11:04,380
With those credits, yeah.

11630
07:11:04,400 --> 07:11:05,900
I think that's more than enough to buy every skin.

11631
07:11:06,460 --> 07:11:07,160
Wait, what?

11632
07:11:07,380 --> 07:11:07,580
Really?

11633
07:11:07,840 --> 07:11:10,660
Yeah, $200 worth of credits is more than enough to buy every skin.

11634
07:11:11,320 --> 07:11:12,080
Oh, I didn't know that.

11635
07:11:12,120 --> 07:11:12,680
That's crazy.

11636
07:11:14,280 --> 07:11:15,560
Oh, wait, there's a lot more.

11637
07:11:15,940 --> 07:11:16,580
Is there not?

11638
07:11:16,940 --> 07:11:17,880
I thought it is.

11639
07:11:17,960 --> 07:11:18,860
No, there's way more.

11640
07:11:18,920 --> 07:11:19,540
Wait, really?

11641
07:11:21,540 --> 07:11:23,240
Oh my God, you're right.

11642
07:11:23,960 --> 07:11:26,160
I was going to say, there's a lot of skins in this game.

11643
07:11:28,180 --> 07:11:29,940
We can buy a lot of them, though.

11644
07:11:30,000 --> 07:11:30,860
Your favorite ones.

11645
07:11:30,880 --> 07:11:31,340
You can.

11646
07:11:31,340 --> 07:11:31,920
You can.

11647
07:11:31,920 --> 07:11:34,080
If you only play a few heroes, then you're good.

11648
07:11:34,400 --> 07:11:36,320
All the skins for your role.

11649
07:11:37,500 --> 07:11:41,020
Yeah, I'm waiting for them to release an Adam Warlock skin that I actually like.

11650
07:11:41,100 --> 07:11:42,480
Same with me, too, for Luna.

11651
07:11:43,260 --> 07:11:44,800
I hate the Luna ones.

11652
07:11:45,480 --> 07:11:47,120
I already got all the skins I want.

11653
07:11:47,540 --> 07:11:49,200
Yeah, but they may release new ones.

11654
07:11:49,640 --> 07:11:51,060
Until Doom comes out, bro.

11655
07:11:51,800 --> 07:11:53,960
Yeah, I want to buy the Doom skins.

11656
07:11:55,740 --> 07:11:57,540
Get the Robert Downey Jr. Doom.

11657
07:11:57,860 --> 07:11:58,460
Oh, true.

11658
07:11:59,780 --> 07:12:00,580
Hold on.

11659
07:12:03,500 --> 07:12:05,900
Guys, you know what I'm most proud of?

11660
07:12:06,400 --> 07:12:07,980
We beat a Groot team.

11661
07:12:08,460 --> 07:12:09,600
We did.

11662
07:12:09,820 --> 07:12:11,980
We did beat a Groot team.

11663
07:12:12,140 --> 07:12:12,360
Finally!

11664
07:12:12,800 --> 07:12:15,980
We never won against a Groot team until now.

11665
07:12:16,840 --> 07:12:17,420
In the tournament.

11666
07:12:17,640 --> 07:12:18,600
We have to face our fears.

11667
07:12:21,820 --> 07:12:24,460
That was like our worst matchup, too.

11668
07:12:24,640 --> 07:12:27,380
And we still managed to do it somehow.

11669
07:12:27,380 --> 07:12:28,560
Yeah, the Groot Moon Knight.

11670
07:12:28,680 --> 07:12:30,500
The moment we went Groot Moon Knight, we were like...

11671
07:12:30,900 --> 07:12:32,020
Not the combo.

11672
07:12:32,260 --> 07:12:33,880
The nasty combo.

11673
07:12:38,280 --> 07:12:38,980
GG's, guys.

11674
07:12:39,220 --> 07:12:40,240
Everyone did great today.

11675
07:12:41,060 --> 07:12:43,040
Happy to play with all of you guys.

11676
07:12:43,140 --> 07:12:45,460
Hope we get to do something together again in the future.

11677
07:12:46,280 --> 07:12:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

11678
07:12:47,000 --> 07:12:47,680
I'm so down.

11679
07:12:50,500 --> 07:12:50,900
GG's.

11680
07:12:50,900 --> 07:12:51,760
We are the champions.

11681
07:12:52,080 --> 07:12:52,800
I'm not done yet.

11682
07:12:53,200 --> 07:12:55,180
Oh yeah, you guys, go to your next tournament.

11683
07:12:55,560 --> 07:12:57,360
You know what's crazy, dude?

11684
07:12:57,500 --> 07:13:00,920
This guy has to go to another tournament and then I have to scrim for another tournament next week, too.

11685
07:13:01,000 --> 07:13:01,520
Wait, really?

11686
07:13:01,600 --> 07:13:01,920
Which one?

11687
07:13:02,700 --> 07:13:04,240
Yeah, which tournament, huh?

11688
07:13:05,340 --> 07:13:06,460
I think you know.

11689
07:13:06,680 --> 07:13:07,340
I think you know.

11690
07:13:07,360 --> 07:13:07,960
No, it's this week.

11691
07:13:09,320 --> 07:13:10,040
This week?

11692
07:13:11,460 --> 07:13:12,200
It's this week?

11693
07:13:12,380 --> 07:13:12,680
No, you're lying.

11694
07:13:13,120 --> 07:13:13,820
It's next week.

11695
07:13:16,840 --> 07:13:19,180
You were like, what?

11696
07:13:21,900 --> 07:13:22,940
You're all warmed up, bro.

11697
07:13:23,680 --> 07:13:24,340
Yeah, it's true.

11698
07:13:24,840 --> 07:13:26,180
Wait, do you have...

11699
07:13:26,860 --> 07:13:27,360
Wait, really?

11700
07:13:28,000 --> 07:13:29,540
Wait, do you know your team yet?

11701
07:13:30,860 --> 07:13:32,040
Uh, I think so.

11702
07:13:32,580 --> 07:13:32,720
Wait, what the fuck?

11703
07:13:32,820 --> 07:13:35,000
I don't know my... I only know Surefour's on my team.

11704
07:13:35,900 --> 07:13:40,360
I think we're still trying to lock in a few more people, so I'm not 100% on that, but...

11705
07:13:40,800 --> 07:13:41,120
Yeah.

11706
07:13:41,560 --> 07:13:43,400
I just need to not touch this game for a little bit.

11707
07:13:43,880 --> 07:13:44,520
You need to not what?

11708
07:13:44,660 --> 07:13:44,820
A day.

11709
07:13:44,960 --> 07:13:46,880
I think that's all I get is one day and then I have to scrim.

11710
07:13:48,540 --> 07:13:49,280
Okay, it's fine.

11711
07:13:49,340 --> 07:13:49,980
That's crazy.

11712
07:13:50,300 --> 07:13:50,800
What the fuck?

11713
07:13:50,820 --> 07:13:52,840
You already know most of your team.

11714
07:13:53,640 --> 07:13:54,300
Yeah, I do.

11715
07:13:54,500 --> 07:13:56,460
I think I know four or five.

11716
07:13:56,740 --> 07:13:58,040
Yeah, I know your team.

11717
07:13:58,740 --> 07:13:59,820
Your team is the one...

11718
07:13:59,820 --> 07:14:00,020
Oh, really?

11719
07:14:00,120 --> 07:14:01,600
Yeah, because he sent me the list.

11720
07:14:02,800 --> 07:14:06,680
So, there's only two teams that's locked in all members and yours is one of them.

11721
07:14:07,640 --> 07:14:08,060
It is?

11722
07:14:08,140 --> 07:14:08,900
Okay, then I'm behind.

11723
07:14:10,580 --> 07:14:13,120
I've not looked at the DMs, obviously.

11724
07:14:13,600 --> 07:14:14,940
I mean, the past few days have been so long, bro.

11725
07:14:15,040 --> 07:14:16,460
This is so... Oh my God, it's like 4 p.m.

11726
07:14:16,720 --> 07:14:17,040
ETSD.

11727
07:14:17,400 --> 07:14:17,880
This took over my life.

11728
07:14:17,880 --> 07:14:19,740
This actually took over my life.

11729
07:14:20,280 --> 07:14:21,280
This is the whole weekend.

11730
07:14:21,280 --> 07:14:22,980
This is the entire weekend.

11731
07:14:23,060 --> 07:14:26,740
I literally did research and watched VODs and took notes of teams and everything.

11732
07:14:27,440 --> 07:14:29,060
I was locked in.

11733
07:14:29,580 --> 07:14:30,700
You guys were prepping.

11734
07:14:30,940 --> 07:14:37,440
The only thing that made us not as sweaty as other teams is that we didn't mute our comms during games.

11735
07:14:38,880 --> 07:14:50,520
When I was researching, some teams would unlist their VODs after the stream's over or they would mute their comms and not show the screen of their ban line.

11736
07:14:51,280 --> 07:14:52,580
So we won't know.

11737
07:14:53,340 --> 07:14:54,520
I did not know that was a thing.

11738
07:14:54,620 --> 07:14:56,940
Yeah, it's a thing in pro tournaments.

11739
07:14:57,240 --> 07:14:58,180
Pro players do that.

11740
07:14:58,880 --> 07:15:01,300
I have to do it for the next tournament.

11741
07:15:02,180 --> 07:15:04,760
I feel like trash doing it, but I have to do it.

11742
07:15:05,200 --> 07:15:06,180
Yeah, he hates it.

11743
07:15:06,400 --> 07:15:07,500
My team, I hate it.

11744
07:15:07,940 --> 07:15:10,820
We also honored when people didn't get their bans off.

11745
07:15:11,160 --> 07:15:12,240
You remember that?

11746
07:15:14,200 --> 07:15:15,740
Cody is still...

11747
07:15:17,240 --> 07:15:18,780
That was weird!

11748
07:15:19,180 --> 07:15:20,060
It was weird.

11749
07:15:21,280 --> 07:15:23,540
Cody is still thinking about that guy.

11750
07:15:23,640 --> 07:15:26,960
Because I didn't get to flame them!

11751
07:15:31,880 --> 07:15:32,840
I guess.

11752
07:15:34,400 --> 07:15:36,200
If it was one thing, it'd be okay.

11753
07:15:36,320 --> 07:15:38,020
But the bro after, like, come on.

11754
07:15:38,040 --> 07:15:39,720
He did like three things after.

11755
07:15:44,060 --> 07:15:46,060
It was like the double whammy.

11756
07:15:46,160 --> 07:15:47,160
It was like, I'm sorry.

11757
07:15:47,480 --> 07:15:49,340
I'll try to fix it, I guess.

11758
07:15:52,460 --> 07:15:53,540
Oh my god.

11759
07:15:53,740 --> 07:15:54,460
GGs, everyone.

11760
07:15:54,480 --> 07:15:56,020
I'm going to clickbait you again, okay?

11761
07:15:56,280 --> 07:15:56,980
Just so you know.

11762
07:15:57,980 --> 07:15:58,340
GGs.

11763
07:15:59,900 --> 07:16:00,260
Gomez,

11764
07:16:03,700 --> 07:16:05,000
I hope your stomach feels better.

11765
07:16:05,500 --> 07:16:06,640
Yeah, I feel better, Gomez.

11766
07:16:07,520 --> 07:16:08,400
I'll be good.

11767
07:16:08,780 --> 07:16:09,380
I ate that sushi.

11768
07:16:09,540 --> 07:16:10,800
I'm a little... I feel a little...

11769
07:16:10,800 --> 07:16:11,600
Eat another sushi.

11770
07:16:12,100 --> 07:16:12,560
I'm good.

11771
07:16:15,500 --> 07:16:16,360
I've never seen that at all.

11772
07:16:16,880 --> 07:16:18,040
It was such a fun journey.

11773
07:16:18,320 --> 07:16:19,160
I actually really liked this one.

11774
07:16:19,160 --> 07:16:19,160
It was great.

11775
07:16:19,660 --> 07:16:20,480
It was very fun.

11776
07:16:21,400 --> 07:16:22,900
I learned so much, man.

11777
07:16:23,380 --> 07:16:24,760
I learned so fucking much from this.

11778
07:16:24,800 --> 07:16:27,020
I think we all, like, got better as players, too.

11779
07:16:28,100 --> 07:16:28,800
Hell yeah.

11780
07:16:29,360 --> 07:16:30,240
Thanks, Hogs.

11781
07:16:31,880 --> 07:16:36,620
Yeah, shout out to Hogs coaching battle.

11782
07:16:37,220 --> 07:16:37,700
Goddamn.

11783
07:16:38,440 --> 07:16:40,980
He learned Strange in, like, two weeks.

11784
07:16:41,060 --> 07:16:41,740
That's crazy.

11785
07:16:43,100 --> 07:16:46,300
It took him his entire career to learn Mag, but two weeks to learn Strange.

11786
07:16:49,160 --> 07:16:49,280
Yeah.

11787
07:16:51,720 --> 07:16:52,800
No, you did a great battle.

11788
07:16:52,960 --> 07:16:53,320
You did great.

11789
07:16:53,460 --> 07:16:54,960
You did awesome, dude.

11790
07:16:55,080 --> 07:16:55,480
Seriously.

11791
07:16:56,100 --> 07:16:57,380
You killed it, bro.

11792
07:16:57,540 --> 07:16:59,740
Yo, you did some insane slam dunks there.

11793
07:17:00,420 --> 07:17:00,740
Yeah.

11794
07:17:01,740 --> 07:17:02,980
Good slam dunks, bro.

11795
07:17:03,200 --> 07:17:05,140
I can't get over your Strange ults.

11796
07:17:05,760 --> 07:17:07,260
Against, was it Riggs' team?

11797
07:17:07,560 --> 07:17:09,060
Twice to save it.

11798
07:17:09,740 --> 07:17:10,920
That was a big one, yeah.

11799
07:17:11,160 --> 07:17:12,080
Yeah, that was a huge one.

11800
07:17:12,080 --> 07:17:12,860
That was a huge one.

11801
07:17:12,920 --> 07:17:16,560
The one where you went through the Invisil and be like, Surprise!

11802
07:17:18,400 --> 07:17:19,840
What are we talking about?

11803
07:17:19,980 --> 07:17:21,140
Shoto blocking the ults.

11804
07:17:21,160 --> 07:17:21,820
Oh, yeah, twice.

11805
07:17:22,120 --> 07:17:23,620
That was amazing.

11806
07:17:25,240 --> 07:17:26,780
It was like a 3D movie.

11807
07:17:27,460 --> 07:17:28,560
You're like, I can block it.

11808
07:17:28,700 --> 07:17:29,720
And we're like, what?

11809
07:17:31,940 --> 07:17:35,960
I think I watched a stream where I saw Namork do that.

11810
07:17:36,100 --> 07:17:37,160
And I was like, you know what?

11811
07:17:37,180 --> 07:17:37,840
I'm going to try it.

11812
07:17:37,900 --> 07:17:38,420
And it does work.

11813
07:17:38,560 --> 07:17:39,360
I'm going to try it.

11814
07:17:41,100 --> 07:17:43,080
You're going to try it in the tournament.

11815
07:17:44,780 --> 07:17:45,900
I mean, it worked, though.

11816
07:17:45,900 --> 07:17:46,320
It worked.

11817
07:17:46,500 --> 07:17:47,000
You're like, you know what?

11818
07:17:47,020 --> 07:17:47,480
This is it.

11819
07:17:47,540 --> 07:17:48,820
This is my moment to shine.

11820
07:17:49,080 --> 07:17:51,180
Never done it before, but let's try it.

11821
07:17:53,040 --> 07:17:55,260
That was such high risk, though.

11822
07:17:56,120 --> 07:17:57,540
High risk, high awards.

11823
07:17:57,620 --> 07:17:58,360
And you got it.

11824
07:18:00,140 --> 07:18:01,220
That was my peak, though.

11825
07:18:01,360 --> 07:18:02,140
I can't peak after that.

11826
07:18:03,640 --> 07:18:05,140
Until next week.

11827
07:18:05,280 --> 07:18:06,880
Until next week, Shoto.

11828
07:18:06,960 --> 07:18:08,180
You're going to pop off next week.

11829
07:18:08,180 --> 07:18:08,700
It's going to be great.

11830
07:18:09,120 --> 07:18:12,560
Yeah, the toast one.

11831
07:18:13,780 --> 07:18:15,020
Wait, that's next week?

11832
07:18:16,140 --> 07:18:16,460
Yeah.

11833
07:18:17,640 --> 07:18:17,960
Okay.

11834
07:18:19,940 --> 07:18:21,620
I thought it was further away.

11835
07:18:24,260 --> 07:18:25,840
Wait, that's what you guys were talking about?

11836
07:18:25,920 --> 07:18:27,120
I don't know my team in that either.

11837
07:18:28,120 --> 07:18:29,920
Wait, can you join my team, Coney?

11838
07:18:31,280 --> 07:18:32,120
You can ask.

11839
07:18:32,160 --> 07:18:33,300
No, request off of him.

11840
07:18:33,400 --> 07:18:33,900
You ask.

11841
07:18:33,980 --> 07:18:35,240
I already asked so much stuff.

11842
07:18:37,780 --> 07:18:38,280
I'll see.

11843
07:18:38,420 --> 07:18:38,780
I don't know.

11844
07:18:39,020 --> 07:18:41,360
He asked me, he was like, what rank are you?

11845
07:18:41,400 --> 07:18:42,300
I said, I'm GM3.

11846
07:18:42,300 --> 07:18:43,100
We need that.

11847
07:18:44,080 --> 07:18:46,500
Well, no, the next day I was like, wait, I'm Celestial now.

11848
07:18:46,680 --> 07:18:48,400
And I was like, I did get boosted.

11849
07:18:48,440 --> 07:18:50,300
Yeah, just tell him he got boosted by me.

11850
07:18:50,440 --> 07:18:51,700
And then he'll be like, oh, okay.

11851
07:18:51,760 --> 07:18:52,880
And then he'll give you a GM.

11852
07:18:52,880 --> 07:18:55,640
Okay, then he's not going to let me on your team if you boosted me.

11853
07:18:55,820 --> 07:18:58,880
Oh, can you just say you got boosted by a pro player?

11854
07:18:59,320 --> 07:19:01,680
And then he'll be like, oh, okay, then you're definitely GM.

11855
07:19:02,480 --> 07:19:03,080
We'll see that.

11856
07:19:03,280 --> 07:19:03,960
I'll ask him.

11857
07:19:04,080 --> 07:19:05,100
I'll see if I can be on the team.

11858
07:19:05,580 --> 07:19:07,360
I didn't know it was set teams this time.

11859
07:19:07,640 --> 07:19:08,360
Yeah, no, it is.

11860
07:19:08,480 --> 07:19:09,480
Coney, be on my team.

11861
07:19:10,180 --> 07:19:10,600
I'll try.

11862
07:19:10,800 --> 07:19:11,400
I'll get in there.

11863
07:19:11,400 --> 07:19:13,900
Yeah, because Wig might be on my team too.

11864
07:19:15,160 --> 07:19:16,700
And then you and Wig can...

11865
07:19:16,700 --> 07:19:17,260
I'll ask.

11866
07:19:17,460 --> 07:19:18,640
I don't know if I'll get it, but we'll see.

11867
07:19:18,940 --> 07:19:19,240
All right.

11868
07:19:19,480 --> 07:19:19,780
Cool.

11869
07:19:19,920 --> 07:19:20,200
All right.

11870
07:19:20,420 --> 07:19:23,740
I'm going to talk to him in my chat now, but GG's everybody.

11871
07:19:24,420 --> 07:19:24,820
GG's.

11872
07:19:25,580 --> 07:19:26,320
GG's, guys.

11873
07:19:26,680 --> 07:19:29,120
Remember to get your duck showed on, everybody.

11874
07:19:29,580 --> 07:19:30,280
Get that duck.

11875
07:19:30,320 --> 07:19:31,560
Get that duck showed on.

11876
07:19:31,780 --> 07:19:32,620
Get a picture of it.

11877
07:19:32,620 --> 07:19:32,700
Yes, sir.

11878
07:19:32,780 --> 07:19:34,180
I'm going right now.

11879
07:19:34,460 --> 07:19:35,620
I'm getting ready right now.

11880
07:19:35,680 --> 07:19:36,160
Get a picture.

11881
07:19:36,500 --> 07:19:37,520
Get a picture of Wig.

11882
07:19:37,760 --> 07:19:38,940
You best believe I will.

11883
07:19:39,520 --> 07:19:40,560
Power that fucker.

11884
07:19:41,400 --> 07:19:42,260
Bye, guys.

11885
07:19:42,260 --> 07:19:42,500
Bye.

11886
07:19:44,340 --> 07:19:45,700
Take care.

11887
07:19:46,940 --> 07:19:47,620
Bye.

11888
07:19:47,620 --> 07:19:48,780
GG's, everyone.

11889
07:19:49,640 --> 07:19:50,240
Oh, my!

11890
07:19:53,190 --> 07:19:54,770
We're the champions!

11891
07:19:56,950 --> 07:19:58,470
Thank you, everyone.

11892
07:19:59,110 --> 07:20:00,890
I'm so happy we won.

11893
07:20:01,530 --> 07:20:03,110
I'm really, really happy.

11894
07:20:03,670 --> 07:20:06,630
Oh, I did not expect to win.

11895
07:20:06,770 --> 07:20:11,690
I really didn't, but oh, my gosh!

11896
07:20:17,400 --> 07:20:20,300
Our training paid off, everyone!

11897
07:20:21,260 --> 07:20:26,740
Oh, I won my first real Marble Rivals tournament!

11898
07:20:27,860 --> 07:20:31,400
And I won it, the real one, not the content creator one.

11899
07:20:31,480 --> 07:20:32,900
This is like actual...

11900
07:20:32,900 --> 07:20:36,980
I mean, this is technically content creator Marble Rivals, but like, you know what I mean?

11901
07:20:37,080 --> 07:20:39,580
Not like randomized teammates and stuff like that.

11902
07:20:39,840 --> 07:20:45,260
I didn't get to do the Twitch Rivals one, but I get to do... I finally was able to do a VTuber.

11903
07:20:45,260 --> 07:20:52,540
I get to do like an actual Marble Rivals tournament of a set team and us scrimming and practicing.

11904
07:20:53,220 --> 07:20:57,340
And out of a hundred plus teams, we got number one!

11905
07:20:58,220 --> 07:21:00,940
Thank you, everybody, for watching!

11906
07:21:01,640 --> 07:21:02,800
Thank you, guys.

11907
07:21:03,000 --> 07:21:04,600
I really appreciate it.

11908
07:21:04,980 --> 07:21:06,960
The VA everyone... Oh my gosh.

11909
07:21:07,180 --> 07:21:08,520
I'm so happy.

11910
07:21:08,700 --> 07:21:10,000
I'm really, really happy.

11911
07:21:11,380 --> 07:21:13,440
Thank you, everyone, for watching.

11912
07:21:13,960 --> 07:21:15,700
Thank you, everyone, for supporting.

11913
07:21:16,000 --> 07:21:17,340
I really appreciate it.

11914
07:21:17,400 --> 07:21:19,680
We have a... We... Ah!

11915
07:21:19,760 --> 07:21:20,660
We did so well.

11916
07:21:20,740 --> 07:21:21,480
We did so well.

11917
07:21:21,560 --> 07:21:23,000
I'm really, really happy, guys.

11918
07:21:23,160 --> 07:21:24,240
Thank you all for the support.

11919
07:21:24,860 --> 07:21:27,060
I hope you guys enjoyed watching this tournament.

11920
07:21:27,240 --> 07:21:31,160
We didn't really stream any of the practices because like, I didn't want to stream the...

11921
07:21:31,160 --> 07:21:34,520
I was like tired to stream scrims and stuff, so I didn't stream any of the scrims.

11922
07:21:34,580 --> 07:21:37,300
So we didn't really have like a little arc going in there.

11923
07:21:37,300 --> 07:21:41,440
But like, technically there was an arc between day one and two.

11924
07:21:43,900 --> 07:21:47,260
Yeah, I'm gonna be taking two days off tomorrow and Tuesday.

11925
07:21:47,820 --> 07:21:52,240
So just to recover from this long stream.

11926
07:21:52,680 --> 07:21:53,640
Seven hours.

11927
07:21:53,900 --> 07:21:55,440
Oh my god, seven hours.

11928
07:21:55,540 --> 07:21:57,140
But yes, thank you, everybody.

11929
07:21:57,540 --> 07:22:00,760
I'm glad I researched teams last night and also like took notes.

11930
07:22:01,160 --> 07:22:04,740
I'm glad I watched the loser finals to take notes.

11931
07:22:04,740 --> 07:22:09,760
And I watched the exact moment Mace was telling his team that like...

11932
07:22:11,260 --> 07:22:13,620
Because then if I didn't, we were gonna ban Mag first.

11933
07:22:13,740 --> 07:22:15,040
We were gonna do a Mag ban.

11934
07:22:17,160 --> 07:22:23,860
So I was... I'm glad that I caught that exact moment where they were like, yeah, we need a ban.

11935
07:22:24,100 --> 07:22:26,840
We need a... It's better that they ban Mag.

11936
07:22:30,080 --> 07:22:32,220
What a coincidence, too.

11937
07:22:32,540 --> 07:22:35,440
The moment I turned on the stream and they said that.

11938
07:22:35,780 --> 07:22:36,080
Yeah.

11939
07:22:42,400 --> 07:22:43,600
Thank you, everybody.

11940
07:22:44,360 --> 07:22:45,640
As always, everyone.

11941
07:22:45,860 --> 07:22:46,960
I'm gonna head off now.

11942
07:22:47,100 --> 07:22:47,840
I'm glad...

11943
07:22:47,840 --> 07:22:50,340
Oh, you guys really think my IGL was that good?

11944
07:22:50,420 --> 07:22:51,540
Thank you, guys.

11945
07:22:51,640 --> 07:22:52,820
I'm not really...

11946
07:22:52,820 --> 07:22:55,820
You know, I had to take over the IGL role.

11947
07:22:55,820 --> 07:23:00,180
Like, I was co-IGL with Gomez, but like...

11948
07:23:00,180 --> 07:23:01,020
Why are you barking?

11949
07:23:01,860 --> 07:23:02,740
What are you eating?

11950
07:23:03,240 --> 07:23:04,420
He's being needy.

11951
07:23:05,400 --> 07:23:06,120
Noki!

11952
07:23:06,360 --> 07:23:06,700
No!

11953
07:23:07,600 --> 07:23:08,060
No!

11954
07:23:08,480 --> 07:23:08,720
No!

11955
07:23:11,600 --> 07:23:12,620
He Magged.

11956
07:23:13,620 --> 07:23:15,380
He had his walkies!

11957
07:23:15,520 --> 07:23:18,100
I walked him during the stream.

11958
07:23:18,540 --> 07:23:24,240
But like, it was very scary taking over IGL role when he was fucking dying.

11959
07:23:26,060 --> 07:23:26,460
So...

11960
07:23:27,580 --> 07:23:30,620
So, yeah, but I'm... Oh, man.

11961
07:23:30,700 --> 07:23:34,600
I'm happy everything went well in the end.

11962
07:23:36,700 --> 07:23:39,280
And I did really well IGLing, yeah.

11963
07:23:40,780 --> 07:23:45,820
And like, making sure everyone had to do macro and micromanage and stuff like that.

11964
07:23:46,500 --> 07:23:47,700
But thank you, everyone.

11965
07:23:47,800 --> 07:23:49,040
Thank you for all the superchats.

11966
07:23:49,360 --> 07:23:50,880
Thank you for... Wait, let me read.

11967
07:23:50,940 --> 07:23:51,620
I'll read a little bit.

11968
07:23:51,660 --> 07:23:51,880
You know what?

11969
07:23:51,880 --> 07:23:52,760
I feel good today.

11970
07:23:52,800 --> 07:23:54,120
I'm gonna read a little bit of superchats.

11971
07:23:54,120 --> 07:23:56,200
I know I should stop streaming, but I'll read three superchats because...

11972
07:23:57,080 --> 07:24:01,040
I still wanna... I wanna... I wanna, you know, read some.

11973
07:24:01,140 --> 07:24:01,880
Oh, there's one.

11974
07:24:02,940 --> 07:24:03,820
Second, thank you for the superchats.

11975
07:24:04,520 --> 07:24:05,220
Thank you, thank you.

11976
07:24:05,500 --> 07:24:06,260
Congrats, team.

11977
07:24:07,140 --> 07:24:08,060
When's dog cam?

11978
07:24:08,200 --> 07:24:09,500
I'm trying to see where he is.

11979
07:24:10,160 --> 07:24:10,960
Soon, soon.

11980
07:24:11,040 --> 07:24:13,140
Whenever I'm getting... Whenever I'm better.

11981
07:24:13,680 --> 07:24:14,300
Whenever I'm better.

11982
07:24:14,300 --> 07:24:15,560
Was it a birthday superchat?

11983
07:24:15,620 --> 07:24:16,960
Whose birthday was it?

11984
07:24:17,460 --> 07:24:17,940
I'm looking.

11985
07:24:19,340 --> 07:24:20,340
I'm trying to see.

11986
07:24:20,340 --> 07:24:21,320
Thank you.

11987
07:24:22,500 --> 07:24:24,620
Oh, Hope, thank you for superchats!

11988
07:24:24,740 --> 07:24:25,360
Thank you, thank you.

11989
07:24:25,400 --> 07:24:26,680
If you're still here...

11990
07:24:26,680 --> 07:24:29,580
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

11991
07:24:29,820 --> 07:24:34,820
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday, dear Hope, happy birthday to you.

07:24:34,980 --> 07:24:36,220
Yeah, happy birthday!

11993

11994
07:24:38,060 --> 07:24:39,220
Thank you, thank you, everybody.

11995
07:24:39,400 --> 07:24:40,600
Thank you, guys, so much.

11996
07:24:41,000 --> 07:24:41,380
And then...

11997
07:24:43,240 --> 07:24:44,460
Let me see.

11998
07:24:45,080 --> 07:24:46,620
Ivy, thank you for the superchats.

11999
07:24:46,720 --> 07:24:47,320
Thank you, thank you.

12000
07:24:47,360 --> 07:24:48,200
Let's go!

12001
07:24:48,200 --> 07:24:49,760
Thank you, thank you.

12002
07:24:50,040 --> 07:24:51,640
I really appreciate it.

12003
07:24:51,720 --> 07:24:52,740
Simon, thank you for the superchat.

12004
07:24:52,800 --> 07:24:53,400
Thank you, thank you.

12005
07:24:53,500 --> 07:24:55,200
3-0 on a team tournament with Kony.

12006
07:24:55,320 --> 07:24:56,520
You might be a power duo.

12007
07:24:56,820 --> 07:24:57,580
Thank you for the superchat.

12008
07:24:57,660 --> 07:24:58,280
Thank you, thank you.

12009
07:24:58,560 --> 07:25:00,880
Kony is like the vibes of the team.

12010
07:25:01,600 --> 07:25:07,420
Um, he's like, honestly, like, he's like either like a big brother, uh, or like an uncle.

12011
07:25:08,140 --> 07:25:10,180
Uh, and he's like such a huge vibe.

12012
07:25:10,280 --> 07:25:11,260
He's like the unc...

12013
07:25:11,260 --> 07:25:14,280
He, I mean, to be fair, he's more like the uncle of any team he's in.

12014
07:25:14,500 --> 07:25:17,540
Uh, because all of us are like young and he's like our...

12015
07:25:18,160 --> 07:25:19,880
He's here to give us reality.

12016
07:25:21,280 --> 07:25:23,360
The uncle slash big bro.

12017
07:25:23,740 --> 07:25:24,100
Yeah.

12018
07:25:25,240 --> 07:25:26,520
Yes, he has a child.

12019
07:25:27,100 --> 07:25:29,360
Um, but yes, thank you all.

12020
07:25:29,620 --> 07:25:30,720
I'm gonna rest my voice now.

12021
07:25:31,000 --> 07:25:32,280
Thank you, everybody, for watching.

12022
07:25:32,620 --> 07:25:33,480
What a fucking arc.

12023
07:25:33,780 --> 07:25:36,100
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

12024
07:25:36,520 --> 07:25:37,020
Posture check.

12025
07:25:37,280 --> 07:25:38,840
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

12026
07:25:39,100 --> 07:25:41,100
And if you, except for me, head to bed.

12027
07:25:41,160 --> 07:25:42,340
Cause you deserve it.

12028
07:25:42,700 --> 07:25:43,520
I'm gonna rest my voice now.

12029
07:25:43,580 --> 07:25:44,580
I've been talking for seven hours.

12030
07:25:44,880 --> 07:25:47,280
As always, everybody, uh, I'll see you guys later.

12031
07:25:47,280 --> 07:25:48,300
Bye.
