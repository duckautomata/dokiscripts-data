1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:09,750
Finally, after the long wait since that concert, I can finally announce something that everyone has been waiting for.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,130
The most polygons you've ever seen!

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,670
A debut that's been anticipated for years!

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,530
My official 3D debut!

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:28,490
With special guests, special performances, special everything!

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,290
And the debut is... right now!

7
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,110
It's finally here!

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,970
Look, dragoons!

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,290
I'm 3D now!

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,190
Look at these movements!

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:45,970
Whoa!

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,950
That new 5090 RTX on is hitting hard.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,150
Wait, is this not the dookie you wanted?

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,110
I mean, you can't get any more 3D than this.

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,910
I told you!

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,610
Anime girls are real!

17
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,410
Come on!

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,390
Look at these close-ups!

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,450
Whoa!

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,410
Look at this!

21
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,650
And this!

22
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,570
It looks like real leather!

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,390
Wait, I know.

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,950
You're expecting something else, right?

25
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,610
Okay, fine, fine.

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,710
I guess you dragoons deserve a real 3D debut.

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,130
It is my one-year anniversary.

28
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,130
Now...

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,650
What you're actually waiting for?

30
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,750
My real 3D debut!

31
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,770
That's right!

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,010
It's me!

33
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,110
Retro dookie!

34
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,050
Man, 3D graphics go hard now.

35
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,430
What?

36
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,270
Is this not the 3D debut you're looking for?

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,590
But it looks and feels so real.

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,690
I mean, if you zoom in...

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,750
You might even see some of my pores.

40
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,210
Oh, I see!

41
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,490
You wanted me in something else, right?

42
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,510
Like, her?

43
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,370
Hey, dragoons.

44
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,750
Is this the 3D dookie you wanted?

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,970
I mean...

46
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,830
I am the best dookie that everyone wants to see.

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,690
All dookie is best girl.

48
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,190
Just like Kathy.

49
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,830
Okay, okay.

50
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,850
Enough of her!

51
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,150
We don't want you to forget about me!

52
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,190
Look, I'm fucking with you guys.

53
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:38,890
Okay?

54
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,710
I know what you're here for.

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,530
Here...

56
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,490
Is the real 3D debut!

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,730
Doesn't get more 3D than this!

58
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,970
That's right!

59
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,910
My true form!

60
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,190
Tomato dookie bird!

61
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,130
What do you think?

62
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,410
Yeah?

63
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,650
I'm probably a little bit bigger than a regular tomato.

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,630
I think a year ago, I was this size.

65
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,630
All right, all right, dragoons.

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,090
No more baiting.

67
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,350
I'm not gonna bait anymore.

68
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,410
All right, you guys ready?

69
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,890
In 3...

70
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,290
2...

71
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,570
1...

72
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,550
My real 3D debut!

73
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,890
Oh!

74
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,730
Here I am.

75
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,870
The real dookie.

76
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,830
I mean...

77
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,870
I mean...

78
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,110
What gets realer than this?

79
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,790
Well...

80
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,490
I hope you guys enjoyed my 3D debut!

81
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,790
Happy one year anniversary, dragons!

82
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,370
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

83
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,210
Ca-ca!

84
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,530
Crook!

85
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:55,790
Real!

86
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,930
Crookie is real!

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,590
Oh my god!

88
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,090
But thank you everybody for coming to my first year anniversary!

89
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,230
Since I came back!

90
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,730
Um...

91
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,370
Surprise!

92
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,330
I guess that's all I had planned!

93
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,390
Ha ha ha!

94
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,670
I'm joking!

95
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,190
I'm joking!

96
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,810
There's more announcements later!

97
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,990
Ca-ca!

98
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,330
Crookie out!

99
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,050
Bye!

100
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,170
Sorry!

101
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,690
There's no actual 3D debut!

102
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,130
That was just the longest beta switch I've ever done!

103
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:23,910
Bye bye!

104
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,650
Oh, so here's me with a cowboy hat!

105
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,450
Yee-haw!

106
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,850
Ca-ca!

107
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,330
Ca-ca!

108
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,670
Alright, bye!

109
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,150
I fly away now!

110
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,170
Woo!
