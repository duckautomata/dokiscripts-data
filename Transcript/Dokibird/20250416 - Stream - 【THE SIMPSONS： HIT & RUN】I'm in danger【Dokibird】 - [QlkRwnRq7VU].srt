1
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,330
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,590
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,910
I am super excited to try out today's game, The Simpsons Hit and Run.

4
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,310
Um, I don't know why it took me a year to realize that I'm, like, indie.

5
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:10,210
Which means I can play anything I want, like, even if these games are technically, like, you know, not really available anymore.

6
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,490
And it really did take me, like, a year to finally realize that.

7
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,710
Like, because, like, every week, I'm like, oh, what do I play?

8
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,430
What do I- what do I fucking play?

9
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,230
And I was like, wait, I've always wanted to play The Simpsons Hit and Run because, um, I actually never grew up with this game.

10
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,410
I've seen a lot of people talk about it.

11
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,770
I see a lot of people play this game, even to this day.

12
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,650
Like, it has a really big speedrun community, apparently, um, which is how I was able to get this game running.

13
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,990
Um, because the speedrun community for this game is, like, um, really big for The Simpsons Hit and Run.

14
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,970
And there's, like, an entire website just dedicated to, like, um, giving you ac- like, giving access to it.

15
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:59,390
And then there's, like, big modding community for this game as well, which is how, like, you know, I YouTubed it, I Googled it in regards to how I set this up and everything.

16
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,270
So, um, so yeah, this is the PC version of The Simpsons Hit and Run.

17
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,490
Uh, for some reason, I just never, ever had a chance to play this game before.

18
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:17,670
Um, when it first came out, uh, when it first came out, um, my dad would never buy me this game for some reason.

19
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,710
Um, because I know it was out on the PlayStation, but I still never had a chance to actually play it.

20
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:33,770
Because back then, I was very limited to what I can and can't play, uh, growing up because the PlayStation, uh, the PlayStation 2 was my dad's console.

21
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,370
So, he only lets me buy, like, you know, if it's, like, a special occasion, I get to buy a game.

22
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,250
And I usually play my dad's hand-me-downs growing up.

23
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,970
So, like, you know, he would be playing, like, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, stuff like that.

24
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,890
And then I would have, like, Kingdom Hearts.

25
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,550
I got to play Kingdom Hearts.

26
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,370
Um, that's, like, my, like, he only buy me games when, if he could play it as well.

27
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,850
So, like, you know, if he's not on it, I get to play on the game as well.

28
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:08,170
So, the rare moments when I did have, like, games I could play myself was Kingdom Hearts, um, Piglet's Big Game, apparently.

29
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,970
I don't know why.

30
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,750
I don't, I don't know why Piglet's Big Game was one of them.

31
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,910
Um, and, like, I don't remember.

32
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,910
I literally, oh, and Spyro.

33
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,110
It was, like, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot.

34
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,790
It was Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, uh, Piglet's Big Game, and Kingdom Hearts.

35
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:41,710
Like, those are the games that I remember I used to, I had, like, I was actually able to play, um, that was, like, that was not just, like, for my dad.

36
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:51,510
Um, I've actually been thinking about playing Kingdom Hearts after Dynasty Warriors, but then, like, I was, like, oh, it's an incredibly long game.

37
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,350
It is very long.

38
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,610
I mean, Kingdom Hearts 1 is shorter than Kingdom Hearts 2, but it is an incredibly long game.

39
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,790
So I might not start with that one first off, but I need something more chill than Dynasty Warriors.

40
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,410
For those who didn't watch last stream, oh, sorry, I just, I just swallowed a hiccup.

41
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,350
Oh my god, that was not good.

42
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,090
That did not feel good.

43
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:36,850
Um, for those who did not watch yesterday's stream, um, Dynasty Warriors is, the Dynasty Warrior origin game is not your regular Dynasty Warriors game, because for some reason, they tricked me and added Souls-like into the boss fights.

44
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:44,770
And so I was stuck for one hour on loop-loop, fucking fighting it as if I was in Dark Souls.

45
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,390
I felt like I was playing a fucking Souls game.

46
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:58,230
Um, so I need, I need something much more chill than, I need something a lot more chill.

47
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,850
I was also thinking about maybe, I wanted to try Sly Cooper.

48
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:13,350
I've never played Sly Cooper before, and I know there's a way, there's like a way to play the first, like the way play the first trilogy of the game.

49
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:23,850
And I've always been interested in the Sly Cooper series, but um, and I was thinking about maybe trying that out after Dynasty Warriors, like another, like a different series for it.

50
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,790
Um, and it's much more chill.

51
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:32,030
It's definitely much more chill than, than Kingdom Hearts or Elder Ring.

52
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:40,790
Um, if it wasn't, okay, if it wasn't for that Lu Bu fight, we would have went straight to Elder Ring, but like, I need a break.

53
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,070
I, I, I need a break from like Souls-like games.

54
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,130
I, I cannot spend hours on a boss right now.

55
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,330
I just want to finish like a new series.

56
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,010
I, Lu Bu killed, Lu Bu pursued me and killed Elder Ring.

57
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,570
He killed, he kills the ones you love.

58
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,930
Um, so yeah, that's gonna be like the future of the schedule.

59
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,570
So, uh, most likely it will be a Sly Cooper right after Dynasty Warriors.

60
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,450
I will be completing Dynasty Warriors Shu Kingdom, um, on YouTube.

61
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:31,670
And then Wei and Wu will be moved to Twitch because like, um, just like how I said in the Dynasty Warriors streams, my manager was like, this would be the Yakuza of your chat, of your channel.

62
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,150
Cause it's like, you need to start a new series.

63
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,150
You cannot keep playing Dynasty Warriors.

64
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,070
It's like, at least Yakuza has like different things to do.

65
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,590
All you're doing is, at least it has like a variety of mini games in Yakuza.

66
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,210
Like,

67
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:03,930
you cannot be stuck romancing Chinese generals and beating people up till the end of 2025.

68
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:16,450
And so, so, um, the moment I finished, finished the Shu Kingdom, he's, it's being moved to Twitch.

69
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,090
Uh, yeah, there's no karaoke in Dynasty Warriors.

70
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:41,150
Um, hey guys, uh, like I said, I didn't grow up with The Simpsons Hit and Run, but I've always seen, I've always seen like those like demos, you know, like those little mini demo play, uh, like PlayStations that they put up, um, in like GameStop slash EB Games for,

71
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,130
is EB Games a Canadian?

72
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,610
I don't know.

73
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,350
I always mix up.

74
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,330
EB Games is the Canadian, right?

75
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,530
EB Games.

76
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:46,870
Yeah.

77
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,370
So it's either, oh wait, no, GameStop is the Canadian.

78
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,710
Sorry.

79
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,570
EB Games is the American version.

80
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,710
I don't remember.

81
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,230
Or was it, or did GameStop buy EB Games?

82
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,430
I, oh yeah, sorry, EB Games.

83
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,430
I forgot that GameStop bought EB Games.

84
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,410
So they're now all sort of called, they're sort of called GameStop now.

85
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,550
Um, yeah.

86
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,570
So I forgot it would, it has not been called EB Games in a very long time.

87
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:22,830
Um, but yeah, uh, I, no, no GameStop literally bought out the entire branch of EB Games in Canada.

88
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,970
So like, we don't have that anymore.

89
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:35,010
Uh, anyway, uh, I would like watch the other kids play on their little, like, you know, those little demo state, demo stations that they have.

90
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:43,110
And I've always wanted to try it out, but like I said, it was just, you know, wrong time for me where my dad didn't buy it.

91
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,990
So I didn't get a chance to try the game out.

92
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,390
So I heard it's like, it's like GTA, but for kids, right?

93
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,890
Like, that's what I heard what this game is basically about.

94
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,250
Um, the only other Simpsons games I've ever played was the arcade version, the beat-em-up arcade version.

95
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,510
Um, uh, the classic one.

96
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,430
And then the, what was it?

97
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,690
And then the Simpsons game.

98
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,550
I played the Simpsons game where you go to heaven and then like, where you go to heaven to kill God or something.

99
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:21,330
Um, I played that one and the classic arcade game, but this is the one, this is the game I didn't play.

100
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,210
I didn't even play the crazy taxi one because it was like before my time.

101
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,190
Um, before I like could touch a console.

102
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,990
Um, so yeah, let's check it out.

103
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,670
All right.

104
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,010
Let me launch this game.

105
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,110
Let me know the sound is okay too.

106
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,630
When it pops up because it plays the theme song.

107
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,530
I also got it running with my controller and everything.

108
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,730
I'm prepared guys.

109
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,410
See, look at that.

110
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,310
I can prepare.

111
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,830
All right.

112
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,250
And then it's this one.

113
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,150
I think it's this.

114
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,190
Look at that guys.

115
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,210
Look at that.

116
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,730
See that.

117
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,870
Oh, and it works on widescreen too, which is great.

118
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,750
I'm going in blind.

119
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,650
Look at that.

120
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,710
Oh, I know how to set up streams before stream.

121
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,810
Do I do it consistently?

122
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,930
Maybe not.

123
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,230
But sometimes, sometimes productive doki is there.

124
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,070
Oh, there's Bart.

125
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,530
I heard the newest season, the last two seasons of Simpsons actually really, really good now.

126
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,720
I brought it down a little bit.

127
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,100
Is it better?

128
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,320
Hello.

129
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
Goodbye bees.

130
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,980
How big are these bees?

131
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,720
Yeah, I heard, I heard they got new writers and everything.

132
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,300
Okay, nice.

133
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,620
Oh, age really.

134
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,840
I didn't age that.

135
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,460
The graphics actually live up a little bit.

136
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,500
Let me put that ahead.

137
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,140
I've actually been watching...

138
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,780
I've been watching the last season so far and I honestly enjoy it.

139
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:19,280
It's actually really weird because like time, like you know, there's no set established time in the Simpsons universe.

140
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,680
So like, like, you know, they're always, they're always going to be the same age.

141
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,100
So the whole premise is that they never, they never age up.

142
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:38,540
And now like, it's really weird because I'm because like, Abraham Simpson is now like used to be like, part of the World War, right?

143
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Like his whole premise was that he was part of World War Two.

144
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,520
But now he's like, yeah, the war I was in, which is now the Vietnam War.

145
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,120
Yeah, so it's like, it's so weird.

146
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,180
And then they're like, yeah, when Marge was pregnant with Bart, that was like 10 years ago.

147
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,200
So like, technically they were parents in 2010.

148
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,400
And so it's all it's, it's so weird.

149
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,540
Like, yeah, now it's like, it's like a floating timeline.

150
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,240
So they have been like continuously retconned to fit like, what 10 years ago was.

151
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,640
So technically, Marge was pregnant with Bart 10 years ago in 2010.

152
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,260
So it's so weird.

153
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,080
All right, let's bring down the music.

154
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,620
Okay.

155
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,640
Yeah, Homer is technically a millennial now.

156
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,640
Oh, all right.

157
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,160
Sound.

158
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:37,940
Music.

159
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,380
All right, let me know if it's better.

160
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,300
All right, is it better now, guys?

161
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,780
Does it sound better, sound guy?

162
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,320
Bum, bum, bum, ba-dum, bum, bum, ba-dum.

163
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,260
Millennial Homer, yeah, he's literally a millennial now.

164
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:06,360
Millennial with three kids and a house and working at a nuclear power plant.

165
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,840
Like, he's living the dream.

166
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,880
He's actually, he's just living the fucking dream right now.

167
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,420
All right, new game.

168
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,610
Oh, what's this?

169
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,130
Whoa, that we know.

170
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,410
Oh, it's Buzz Cola.

171
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,110
Plus, it has a special ingredient too hot for the FDA.

172
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,690
It'll give you the get up and go.

173
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,590
You need to do all the pathetic stuff you have to do.

174
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,530
Try new improved Buzz Cola.

175
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:57,290
Hey guys, did you hear that, that we have just restocked the Hyatt PC case, guys?

176
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,970
You can get right now at your local Hyatt store.

177
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,150
Use WASD and space bar to jump.

178
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,230
Okay, so that is...

179
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,670
Oops, sorry.

180
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,430
Sorry, Marge.

181
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,570
Get over there, woman.

182
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,710
That's right.

183
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,270
Use coins to purchase cars and clothes.

184
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:20,590
Okay.

185
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,750
All right, how do I talk to you, Marge?

186
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,010
Marge?

187
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,350
Oh, wait, I can get arrested?

188
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,510
Nah.

189
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,570
Oh, shit.

190
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,970
Oh, fuck.

191
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,570
I'm sorry, Marge.

192
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,990
How do I go inside?

193
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,650
Oh, how do I go inside?

194
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,010
Okay, there, there, there.

195
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,410
All right, can arrest me if I'm at home.

196
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,190
Oh, find all gags?

197
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,670
I didn't know I could get arrested for kicking her.

198
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,730
How was I supposed to know?

199
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,170
We're family.

200
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,050
Okay, hello, Marge.

201
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,070
Nothing happened.

202
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,290
Okay, I need to know what button is what.

203
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,990
I let her kick me.

204
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,750
Okay, the cola caper.

205
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,050
Go to the quickie mart and purchase some ice cream and cola.

206
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,210
Okay, I got that.

207
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,190
Where's my car?

208
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,470
Dude, where's my car?

209
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,870
Left click to get inside the car.

210
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,290
What's left click?

211
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,830
Press W to accelerate, A, D to steer, and S to brake.

212
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,830
Right click to...

213
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,810
Okay, guys, what are any of those on my controller?

214
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,110
Okay, that's get out of the car.

215
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,250
Honk.

216
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,590
Wait, oh, shit.

217
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,190
Oh, I reset my car.

218
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,010
Guys, I'm trying to figure out...

219
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,270
I'm trying to figure out how to drive.

220
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,430
Give me a sec.

221
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,990
Okay.

222
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,670
I can honk.

223
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,490
I can do everything but drive.

224
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,330
Oh, oh, it's start button.

225
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,470
Okay, I figured it out.

226
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,930
It's the start button.

227
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,050
Brake object.

228
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,590
Oh, shit.

229
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:18,970
Nice.

230
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,510
So, I can just brake things.

231
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,910
All right, nice.

232
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,450
All right, I know how to drive.

233
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,610
It's okay.

234
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,030
As long as it doesn't hit blue, I should be fine.

235
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,550
As long as it doesn't hit blue, it should be fine.

236
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,710
So, I can run over as many people as I want.

237
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,250
See, look at that.

238
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,310
All right, nice.

239
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,590
I don't know why driving is the start button, but like, I'll take it.

240
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,670
Wait, look, there's a wrench.

241
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,390
Jackson, thank you for the super chat.

242
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,210
Thank you, thank you.

243
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,990
It's always tradition when you get the game for the first time to kick Marge.

244
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,970
I don't know why everyone does that.

245
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,530
Wait, what does the wrench just do?

246
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,670
I didn't pay attention.

247
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,610
Okay, why the fuck is start button drive?

248
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,310
What does the wrench do?

249
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,030
Kick, kick, kick.

250
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,730
Yay, free money!

251
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,650
If it touches the floor, it's free.

252
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,110
Oh, it repairs my car.

253
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,650
Wait, my car can't get damaged?

254
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,150
Hello, Appu.

255
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,190
Oh, it's Sam!

256
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,590
Did that free him?

257
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,390
Oh, hey, Christy.

258
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,350
What are you looking at?

259
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,790
Hello.

260
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:37,990
Hello.

261
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,230
Can I like... Is there anything I can take here?

262
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,190
Ever since the accident.

263
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,370
The multiple accidents.

264
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,230
Yay!

265
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,010
I finished the first mission!

266
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,150
It's not nudie master, I'll clothe.

267
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,790
It's like the most...

268
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,570
The most like... Also like if you read those magazines in the public area, I'm pretty sure you get arrested.

269
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,790
He's most likely just reading a cosmopolitan.

270
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,210
Oh, hey, clothes.

271
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,750
100 coins to purchase casual.

272
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,850
Is casual just me naked?

273
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,390
That's my casual wear.

274
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,850
The chosen one.

275
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,470
No, I'm broke right now.

276
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,370
I don't have money.

277
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,330
All right.

278
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,590
Let's get out of here.

279
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,580
Did I just go home?

280
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,400
Oh, I have to go home.

281
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,300
Hello, where's my car?

282
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,580
Oh, I left my car here.

283
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,180
All right, let's go.

284
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,900
It's time to go home.

285
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,460
Fuck, okay.

286
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,340
As long as it doesn't go to blue, I can run over as many people as I want.

287
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,660
It's like the three strikes rule.

288
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,920
Hurry up.

289
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,800
Oh, yeah, see?

290
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,820
I still have time.

291
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,840
And then shortcut.

292
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,960
All right, just today though.

293
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,880
Just only today.

294
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,820
That's a bad day.

295
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,180
Hello, Marge.

296
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh, no!

297
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,660
Don't worry, I got you, mom.

298
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,280
I have to go to work?

299
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,840
Oh my God, same, Homer.

300
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,540
I'm like, I have to go to work?

301
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,820
Try the school, where's my car?

302
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,600
Oh, wait, there's my car.

303
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,020
I need to reset my car.

304
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,800
All right.

305
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,900
Whoops, sorry.

306
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,800
All right, here we go.

307
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,200
Wait, shortcut!

308
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,320
If I go this way, it'd be faster, because it's a shortcut.

309
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,340
Get out of here, Skinner!

310
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,780
All right.

311
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,400
Let's see, where do I go?

312
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Where's the school?

313
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,340
Why is the school so far away?

314
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,020
All right, nice.

315
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,160
See, Skinner follows traffic rules.

316
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,060
And those are just suggestions.

317
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,840
Oh, fuck.

318
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,760
All right, wait, wait.

319
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,320
Okay, never mind.

320
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,620
I figured it out.

321
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,640
Don't worry, I'm here.

322
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,440
I'm here now, I made it.

323
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,720
Don't worry, Lisa!

324
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,460
Daddy's got your project!

325
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,290
I did it.

326
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,490
Lisa, where are you?

327
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,370
I got your school project.

328
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,950
Everything is food, technically.

329
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,170
If it goes in my mouth, it's food.

330
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,790
Yay!

331
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,770
Kongo, thank you for the superchat!

332
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,710
Thank you, thank you!

333
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,350
Guys, we're scared of Shredder.

334
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,410
Showing this game to the show creator, because maybe he won't like that you can kick everyone.

335
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,190
The first thing he did was kick Marge all the way.

336
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,330
Wait, how come he doesn't get arrested?

337
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,770
How does he not... Wait, can I kick Lisa?

338
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,390
Wait, I can kick everyone?

339
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,110
Okay, Lisa, get over here.

340
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,730
Hey, Ralph.

341
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,570
Oh, I can't kick him.

342
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,390
That was a lie.

343
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,990
That's a lie.

344
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,830
I can't believe you lied to me.

345
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,090
I can't kick everyone.

346
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,750
I can only kick...

347
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,010
Wait, I can only kick my wife?

348
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,730
Okay, that's a little bit fucked up.

349
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,910
All right, let's go home now, I guess.

350
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,050
Back to my wife.

351
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,040
Don't worry, see?

352
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,860
Three second rule.

353
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,940
As long as it doesn't go blue, everything is fine.

354
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,820
Your only suggestions.

355
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,640
All right, where is home?

356
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,380
Is there a shortcut for home?

357
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,940
I think he's hungry, but it's like way too early for food.

358
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,440
Oh, shit.

359
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,060
Okay, that was... I can run over one more person.

360
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,380
That's okay.

361
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,140
That lets me have one more person.

362
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,660
All right, as long as I don't...

363
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,260
As long as I follow the traffic suggestions, I won't get arrested.

364
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,760
Oh, I can run over another person.

365
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,480
All right, nice.

366
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,980
All right, I choose you.

367
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,300
And maybe you.

368
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,220
All right, as long as I don't break any other traffic suggestions, I'm fine.

369
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,460
Oh, I get one more.

370
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,460
I get one more.

371
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,240
Nice, okay.

372
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,660
Oh, he's coming over.

373
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,360
He's coming over.

374
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,820
He's like, you didn't listen to... Okay.

375
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,640
Okay, dad, I'll feed you.

376
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,830
I'm back.

377
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,730
He was not happy.

378
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,910
He was like, did you not hear me bark?

379
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:02,330
How dare you make me walk all the way over to be fed.

380
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,370
Yeah, everyone knows I'm gonna go to heaven.

381
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,910
You should respect me.

382
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,790
I'm God's chosen child.

383
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,610
All right, where's Flanders?

384
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,310
Hi diddly ho, neighborino.

385
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,870
What do you want, Ned?

386
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,830
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

387
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,710
Thank you, thank you.

388
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,730
I'm not going to read that.

389
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,430
Who could have done such a thing?

390
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,590
Yeah, it can't be me.

391
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,430
Collect all six of Ned's lost items before time runs out.

392
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,070
Wait, I have to do that?

393
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,250
Can I just like never return them?

394
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,410
He'll forgive me.

395
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,910
A good Christian man will always forgive thy neighbor.

396
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,370
Let me just steal his money real quick.

397
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,570
He'll forgive me.

398
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,530
To destroy WASP cameras, jump into the air with a space bar and then right click.

399
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,510
Wait, there we go.

400
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,450
Oh, money.

401
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,050
Okay, oh nice.

402
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,050
I can't believe there's all these lost items in Ned's backyard.

403
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,490
Wow.

404
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,110
Don't worry, I'll keep good.

405
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,950
I'll keep good look for them.

406
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,650
Oh, what's in here, Ned?

407
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,510
I'll make sure to look after them.

408
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,930
Is that Ralph?

409
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,690
Wait, not Ralph.

410
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,310
Todd?

411
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,010
Yeah, he doesn't need it anyway.

412
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,910
He doesn't drink.

413
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,250
He's a good Christian man.

414
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,390
Okay, I need to go find his items and get in the car.

415
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,390
What's he doing with a bomb shelter?

416
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,870
Does he not trust- does he not trust me?

417
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,170
Find Ned's tuxedos.

418
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,710
Fuck, okay.

419
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,450
Where did I put it?

420
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,330
Where did I put his tuxedo?

421
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,080
All right, nice.

422
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,120
Why is it over here?

423
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,160
Okay, I need to find his lawnmower.

424
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,320
Where is it?

425
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,120
Where the fuck did I put his lawnmower?

426
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,600
Oh, there it is.

427
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,380
Oh, nice.

428
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,080
I like how they're all conveniently like in front of me.

429
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,800
And then there is- oh, hey, Barney.

430
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,880
Oh, shit.

431
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,220
Hey, Barney, are you part of Ned's lost items?

432
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,540
Please don't do- What do you want?

433
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,080
You remember that cooler I gave you for your birthday?

434
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,300
Well, Flanders wants it back.

435
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,240
Now what will I use for a toilet?

436
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,800
Oh, shit.

437
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,160
Okay.

438
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:10,560
Was apparently- guys, guys, I can't- I can't go to my options, so I can't turn down the music.

439
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,980
Oh, no.

440
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,380
All right, where do I go?

441
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,200
I have to go...

442
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,160
Please move!

443
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,360
I have the right of law!

444
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,260
Move!

445
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,780
This is my path!

446
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm doing a u-turn!

447
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,680
All right, what's wrong with your cont- I have no idea.

448
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,200
I don't think this game works with an Xbox controller very well.

449
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,240
His wife's dead anyway.

450
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,220
He doesn't need a picture to remind him of his trouble.

451
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,100
All right, I'm doing him a favor, making him forget that he has a wife.

452
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,320
Yeah.

453
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,280
He can, like, not breathe for a second longer.

454
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:08,940
Yay!

455
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,060
That's just a song, not real life.

456
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,740
All right, let's see.

457
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,880
Oh, I have to go here.

458
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,080
Oh, wait, what's this?

459
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,480
Oh, nice!

460
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,000
Yay!

461
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,980
All right, time to get back to Ned.

462
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,000
You won't know- he'll call- He might give me a reward money for finding his lost items that I didn't borrow.

463
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,280
All right.

464
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,940
Oh, come on, guys.

465
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,020
Let me have some fun.

466
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,200
Get in front of my car.

467
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,860
It's okay.

468
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,620
I get, like... I get, like, six people I can run over per day before the cops get me.

469
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,240
All right, hello, Ned.

470
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,240
I got your stuff!

471
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,240
Hello.

472
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,200
I found it.

473
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,900
Do I get a reward?

474
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,140
You're missing stuff.

475
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,840
No, about the reward.

476
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,720
Thanks, neighbor Rooney.

477
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,100
Here's your reward.

478
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,900
A prayer from the Lord's number one fan.

479
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,380
What?

480
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,240
Father in heaven, bless this noble oaf.

481
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,060
Stupid Flanders getting happiness from religion.

482
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,140
How dare he be happy with religion?

483
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,240
I can't believe it.

484
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,100
Why can't I be happy?

485
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,200
Why do I have to be depressed?

486
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,360
Joel, thank you for the 10 gifted shits.

487
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:37,720
Thank you.

488
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,500
Thank you.

489
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,740
You are forgiven.

490
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,940
Why can't he be miserable like the rest of us?

491
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,480
I, um... Hello, my wife.

492
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,740
Oh, shit.

493
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,180
I forgot about my work.

494
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,240
Wait, Gabe does an autosave?

495
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,660
Wait, I don't know how to get to my main menu.

496
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,920
There's no... There's no option buttons.

497
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,860
What do you mean?

498
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,340
There's no option buttons, guys.

499
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,100
I can't get to my menu.

500
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,160
Wait, oh, I just pressed escape.

501
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,160
Guys, I figured it out.

502
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,900
I have to use my keyboard.

503
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,800
Never mind.

504
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,320
All right, sound.

505
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,780
I'll turn down the music a little bit.

506
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,600
And then...

507
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
Bring it up a little bit more.

508
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,380
Okay.

509
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,340
Oh, let me know if it's better, guys.

510
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,520
Let me know if this sounds better.

511
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,500
Sound guy.

512
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,520
All right, I just have to...

513
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,040
Wait, how do I save?

514
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,360
Oh, there it is.

515
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,080
Save game.

516
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,420
Did it work?

517
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,000
All right, nice.

518
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,720
Okay, save successful.

519
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,440
Level progress.

520
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,280
All right, let's go.

521
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,500
Dude, where's my car?

522
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,000
I keep forgetting where I park it.

523
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh, I parked it at Ned's place.

524
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,680
Nice.

525
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,240
I love my free... free parking at my neighbor's house.

526
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,780
Stupid fucking planners.

527
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,040
How can you be happy?

528
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,780
Why can't you be miserable like the rest of us?

529
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,700
All right, let's see.

530
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,180
Nice.

531
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,160
Oh, wait.

532
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,200
Free wrench.

533
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,220
Oh, yeah.

534
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:33,920
Here we go.

535
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,820
Hey, Lenny.

536
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,900
Oh, shit.

537
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,360
That's okay.

538
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,800
I still have... I still have four more forgivens.

539
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:41,960
Yeah.

540
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,080
All my homies hate planners.

541
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,320
Borrow the Plow King to complete this mission.

542
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,180
You will need the Plow King.

543
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,060
Purchase it at the gasoline station for 150 coins.

544
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,660
Use phone booths to access... I need to pay Barney?

545
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm his best friend!

546
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
The amount of...

547
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,700
The amount of duff beer I bought him should be enough to fucking... I owe you a fucking Plow King.

548
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,980
Barney, if you're my friend, you would give it to me for free.

549
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,240
Just don't shoot me with that dark gun.

550
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,300
Whatever.

551
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,240
He said take it.

552
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,780
Why do I have to buy it?

553
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,660
Can't believe it.

554
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,720
He's not a homie.

555
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,660
Destroy Smitter's car before he gets to the... Yay!

556
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,040
Vandalism!

557
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,840
I love vandalism.

558
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,860
Thanks for the car, bro.

559
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,480
That's for making me pay for it.

560
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,740
Where's the phone booth?

561
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,440
Did I destroy it?

562
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,700
Oh, no.

563
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,260
There it is.

564
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,620
All right.

565
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,000
Where's his car?

566
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,120
It's okay.

567
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,700
He won't know it's me because, like, technically it's Barney's car.

568
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,140
All right.

569
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,380
It's nice that, like, everything is conveniently near me.

570
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,420
This is a lovely neighborhood for a millennial.

571
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,720
All right, only if I get caught.

572
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,080
Okay, I'll go through the shortcut.

573
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,760
Yay!

574
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,120
Shortcut!

575
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,840
I am excellente!

576
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,580
Free money!

577
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,760
All right, where is he?

578
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,540
When this is over, I'm hitting the store.

579
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,360
Oh, there he is.

580
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,480
Where's Smitter's car?

581
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,660
Take that!

582
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,280
Where is it?

583
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,200
Wait, where is it?

584
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:36,900
Where's his car?

585
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,420
Oh, is he driving away?

586
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,920
Wait, he can do that?

587
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,700
Get over here.

588
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,480
Get over here.

589
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,420
I don't want to go to work.

590
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,500
Oh, shit.

591
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,560
It's fine.

592
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,620
The worst thing is I'm not imagining these guys.

593
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,880
It's fine.

594
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,280
They'll understand.

595
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,540
It's fine.

596
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,880
When are you gonna catch me?

597
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:55,620
Oh, shit!

598
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,040
Oh, shit.

599
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Guys, I think I got caught.

600
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,600
I think I got caught.

601
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,080
Oh my god, get back here.

602
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:07,800
Yeah.

603
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,140
Wait, where is he?

604
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,800
I don't know how to go backwards, guys.

605
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
Okay, here we go.

606
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,520
Oh my god, it's just because I let them catch me.

607
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,980
I literally got out of my car, guys.

608
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,880
I let them catch me.

609
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,620
It's okay, shortcut.

610
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,420
I got him now.

611
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,960
You can't get away.

612
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,520
Oh, shit.

613
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,160
Oh, shit.

614
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,200
God damn it.

615
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,720
These controls are so dumb.

616
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,000
Please, I'm trying to figure out how to go backwards.

617
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,750
Oh my god, I need to rebuy my controls.

618
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,550
Smitters, give me a sec.

619
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,610
Please, get over here.

620
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,150
I need to rebuy my controls.

621
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,750
Smitters, please.

622
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,350
Time out.

623
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,010
All right, nice.

624
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,470
There we go.

625
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,350
I have to reset my car every time.

626
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,430
I don't know how to go backwards.

627
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,470
Okay, he's almost there.

628
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,210
It's all right.

629
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,630
I'm pretty sure Mr. Burns gave you insurance, right?

630
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,470
There's no way.

631
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:29,030
Our ever-loving boss, who loves his workers, definitely got you insurance.

632
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,770
All right, where are you?

633
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,570
Yeah, exactly, Smitters.

634
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,330
You should have learned to drive better.

635
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,950
I get to go to work now.

636
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,050
Yippee.

637
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,350
Okay, I should rebuy my controls.

638
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,830
I'm just like, I can't.

639
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,290
All right, controller.

640
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,390
Vehicle control.

641
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,850
Um, reverse.

642
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,370
What the fuck is J button six?

643
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,570
Oh, that's two.

644
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,070
Okay, I don't need to boot my horn, I guess.

645
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,050
Action, get out.

646
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,310
Okay, how do I start?

647
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:11,670
Okay.

648
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,450
Press A to start.

649
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,070
That should be my reverse.

650
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,710
Um...

651
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,290
It's the six button, of course.

652
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,530
Um, I'll put this for...

653
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,130
brake, and then this would be my e-brake.

654
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,030
Uh, the rest is okay.

655
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,290
All right.

656
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,230
Nice.

657
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,590
Now, guys, I can finally reverse.

658
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,370
I did it.

659
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,930
I finally learned how to reverse my car.

660
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,710
I'll never know what J button six is.

661
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,410
Yippee.

662
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,510
There is no road.

663
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,210
Technically, every pathway is a road, if you think about it.

664
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,050
It's not my fault.

665
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,070
There's not even a sidewalk.

666
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,330
That's your fault for standing there.

667
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,470
That's the bike lane.

668
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,510
So we're both breaking rules.

669
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,250
All right.

670
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,470
Yippee.

671
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,090
Off to work I go.

672
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,370
I love my job.

673
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,090
Yay!

674
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,190
Oops.

675
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,590
Oh, wait.

676
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,630
I'm supposed to get out.

677
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:21,790
Oops.

678
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,710
Give me a sec.

679
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,730
Let me head to my job real quick.

680
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,670
Let me clock in.

681
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,010
Do my nine to five.

682
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,050
Hello.

683
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,690
The safety inspector is here.

684
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,790
Oh, no.

685
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,750
Anime girls could be watching me right now.

686
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,750
Destroy all the power couplings before the time runs out.

687
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,570
Wait, what are they?

688
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,110
Is it this?

689
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,230
Oh, shit.

690
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,350
Oh, shit.

691
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,990
What the fuck?

692
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:00,830
Okay.

693
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,270
Get out of here.

694
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:04,710
Exactly.

695
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,850
I don't want to be monitored.

696
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,590
Thingy goes down.

697
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,530
Can't monitor me if they're all... if they're all broken.

698
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,570
Accidentally.

699
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,190
Oh my god.

700
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,070
They're so faulty.

701
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,470
They just break like that.

702
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,050
Mr. Bird should invest in something...

703
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,550
Something more concrete.

704
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,550
Oh, shit!

705
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:30,990
Okay.

706
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,450
Wait, what?

707
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,010
Where do I go from here?

708
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:36,430
Oh.

709
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,190
Where do I... Oh, nice.

710
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:39,550
No.

711
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,630
Why is it so fast?

712
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,430
All right, nice.

713
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:45,650
Fuck!

714
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,610
Okay, I got this.

715
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,450
I got it this time.

716
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,630
Okay, I figured it out.

717
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,570
I jump across it.

718
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,230
All right, up I go.

719
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,850
All right, across I go.

720
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,670
Goodbye.

721
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,650
All I'm saying is that...

722
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,410
It... I can't believe they just like accidentally fell down like that from a high...

723
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,290
From a high place.

724
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,510
Oh my god.

725
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,010
Okay, eight.

726
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,790
Last one.

727
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,990
Nine.

728
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,470
Yay!

729
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,510
I did it!

730
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,730
I did my job!

731
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,410
Emily, thank you for the super chat.

732
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:27,750
Thank you.

733
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,450
Thank you.

734
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,670
Save.

735
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,770
And I get money!

736
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,810
Yippee!

737
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,190
All right, did my job.

738
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,670
Did what Mr. Bird is paying me to do.

739
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,850
Finally, I can get some sleep.

740
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,350
Mindless drones, return to your ugly families.

741
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,050
I'm so talented and good looking.

742
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,910
Yeah, I get to... I get paid to destroy stuff.

743
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,510
Yay!

744
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,390
I love my job.

745
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,710
Where's the phone booth?

746
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,050
All right, I need to get my car.

747
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,770
Uh...

748
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,450
All right.

749
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,310
Gotta go home.

750
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,590
Happy wife is a happy life.

751
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,110
How do I go backwards?

752
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,310
Okay, just backing up.

753
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,550
Backing up.

754
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,770
Oh, I can just drive like this.

755
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,870
Okay, never mind.

756
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,530
It was a lot harder than I thought.

757
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,230
I didn't kill anybody.

758
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,430
They're okay.

759
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,430
If they're dead, why is there like three of them?

760
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:51,970
If I kill one out of a... out of triplets, then technically... technically they have three lives.

761
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,090
Or two lives after that.

762
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,670
All right.

763
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:58,770
Nice.

764
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,850
All right, time to go home.

765
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:01,790
Shortcut!

766
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,070
Ow.

767
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,750
Oh my god, do I just have duff beards?

768
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,390
Look at that.

769
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,590
It's like an extra life if you have triplets.

770
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,550
Is that another car?

771
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,290
Gil, do you have a car for me?

772
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,490
What car do you have?

773
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,470
I know you're always broke.

774
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,070
The wolf is at old Gil's door.

775
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,290
Oh my god, it's a duff truck?

776
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,430
I can't afford it.

777
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:26,970
I'm broke.

778
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,590
Don't worry.

779
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,330
I'll just use Bart's college fund.

780
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,410
He's not gonna need it.

781
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,530
He'll never turn 11.

782
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,490
He'll be 10 forever.

783
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,810
What is he gonna do?

784
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,150
I'll just use the shortcut with the cemetery.

785
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,670
Okay, never mind.

786
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,170
Apparently the door to the cemetery is like really really strong.

787
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,730
All right, we need to find a wrench.

788
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,170
My car does not look so good and I don't have insurance right now.

789
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,550
I don't think and I don't think I'll ever get insurance.

790
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,970
Not just right now, but maybe ever.

791
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,270
All right, nice.

792
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,550
All right, I'm back home, Mike.

793
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,410
Back to my loving wife and family.

794
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,510
Where are they?

795
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:21,990
Hello?

796
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,290
I worked so hard to...

797
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,070
So I can get like, you know, a nice home-cooked meal.

798
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,690
Not the women!

799
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,150
Yeah, where are they?

800
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,370
Oh, there's one over there now.

801
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,170
Yeah.

802
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:16,590
Oh my god, Marge, do you think the government sent out those pigeons to spy on us?

803
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,110
Imagine that's their like in bed talk.

804
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:25,210
I was like, oh, you want me to get a pigeon right now and let the government watch?

805
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,870
Yeah, Marge.

806
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,650
Did you hear that the earth might be flat?

807
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,810
Don't kink shame.

808
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,140
And that they faked the moon landing.

809
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,820
Oh, they just released the documents to JFK's assassination, Marge.

810
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,860
God damn it, I keep getting out of the car.

811
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,220
Tell us more about the pyramids, homie.

812
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,460
Okay, oh, isn't that sexy?

813
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,740
You want to read the documents right now in bed?

814
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,780
All right.

815
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,300
I can almost see the car.

816
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,500
I can almost see where it is.

817
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,780
It's okay.

818
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,640
What's gonna happen?

819
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,440
The car's gonna fucking explode.

820
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,930
All right, I'm right here.

821
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,810
I'm literally right next to you.

822
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,530
Where is he taking me?

823
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,310
Am I supposed to destroy the car or like, oh no, I just have to be next to him.

824
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,990
Okay, the green bar is like it being further away from me.

825
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,450
Where is he going?

826
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,990
Where are you going, sir?

827
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,170
That's my job.

828
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,690
I literally just left work to avoid work.

829
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:58,250
Okay.

830
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,150
Look at that.

831
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,770
Oh, when I run over people, I don't get hurt.

832
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,270
I don't get like the police meter.

833
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,630
So I can kill as many people as I want here.

834
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:10,330
Boop.

835
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:13,770
Where am I?

836
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,230
Oh my god, I'm at the chosen one.

837
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:16,690
Oh shit.

838
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,910
Oh fuck, no, my car!

839
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,390
No!

840
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:21,910
My car!

841
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,970
Wait, give me a sec!

842
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,710
Let me call my next car!

843
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,030
No!

844
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,190
Oh, Mr. Burns is behind all this.

845
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:32,330
Wait, I did it.

846
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,130
Spying is so like him.

847
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,990
That wrinkled old monkey skeleton.

848
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,050
Wait, did I finish?

849
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,210
Wait, did I?

850
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,010
Yeah, I did it!

851
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,090
Yay!

852
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,330
Wait, is that my car?

853
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,330
Is it still drivable?

854
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:49,850
Hey, it's still drivable.

855
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,230
Nice.

856
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:50,910
It still works.

857
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:51,230
Nice.

858
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,350
All right, let me drive home.

859
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,510
Hahaha!

860
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,150
Reminded me to never get in the car with Doki.

861
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,090
No, no, thank you for the super chat.

862
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,630
Thank you.

863
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,150
Thank you.

864
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,590
Don't worry, I can fix my car right here.

865
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,370
See guys, it works!

866
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,830
My car is still working!

867
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,810
Don't worry, I'm almost at the wrench!

868
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,670
Come on, little guy!

869
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,350
Hahaha!

870
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,390
Just get over!

871
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,830
Okay, I can't go upstairs.

872
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,670
Now I know.

873
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,570
Don't worry, I'll find another wrench.

874
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,910
It's okay, even though my car is barely a car.

875
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,950
I can still cause mayhem.

876
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,270
Get over here, people!

877
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,130
I need to get my quota in.

878
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,090
Five people per day.

879
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,570
That's right!

880
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,050
That's right!

881
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,770
Even with this, I can still run over people.

882
00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:00,630
Guys, I'll get the wasp the moment I find a wrench, guys.

883
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:01,830
Don't worry.

884
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,750
I'm slowly coming over.

885
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,030
You can't run away from me!

886
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,090
You can't run away!

887
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,490
It's like bullying!

888
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:12,470
Hahaha!

889
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,890
All right, don't worry guys.

890
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,570
I'll get- listen to that baby purr!

891
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,290
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

892
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,590
Thank you, thank you.

893
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:26,790
All right.

894
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,210
Wait, they're all just like powerp- like, sorry, power plant workers.

895
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,370
All right, I can fix this.

896
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,270
Yeah, don't worry.

897
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,690
My car will be fixed here.

898
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:37,470
All right.

899
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,410
Don't worry, I can fix my car.

900
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:41,830
There you go.

901
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:42,050
See?

902
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:42,870
Good as new.

903
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,990
Look at that.

904
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,590
I told you guys.

905
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,310
Nothing to worry about.

906
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,330
Where are all the power plant workers?

907
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,030
All right, now there's real people.

908
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:59,930
Never punished.

909
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,270
Hey, where's Marge?

910
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,690
Marge, why are you at the grocery store?

911
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:06,510
Why are you at the nicer grocery store?

912
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,190
We're supposed to stop at the quickie mart.

913
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,390
We can't afford this.

914
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,970
Everybody we've got to follow him.

915
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,230
Not now, Homer.

916
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:20,070
A new violent video game has hit the streets and we need to get rid of it before it warps any children.

917
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,910
Oh, no, not violent video games.

918
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,990
And therefore should be destroyed.

919
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,010
I guess.

920
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,490
Oh my god.

921
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:34,090
Okay, hit the delivery truck and collect our bonestorm games before time runs out.

922
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,810
All right, where is it?

923
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,850
Don't worry, Marge.

924
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,230
I'll do what you want me to do for you.

925
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,750
Happy wife happy.

926
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,270
Oh my god.

927
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,710
Who let this grandpa drive?

928
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:46,670
All right.

929
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,050
Nice.

930
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:50,790
If a grandpa's driving it, that means like we can blame it on him.

931
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,810
Okay, nice.

932
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:54,890
Nice.

933
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,130
If I like... oh shit.

934
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:56,830
Oh shit.

935
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,090
Nice.

936
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:58,270
All right.

937
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,650
If I let him stay there.

938
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,510
No, I trapped him in the corner.

939
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,390
Stay in the corner.

940
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:04,810
Stay in the corner.

941
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,850
Stay in the corner.

942
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,190
Stay in the corner.

943
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,090
Grandpa, stay in the corner.

944
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,090
Wait, I think I dropped... wait, didn't I drop a couple of items already?

945
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,470
Oh, they despawned.

946
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:17,210
Oh shit.

947
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:17,490
Okay.

948
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,130
Give me a sec.

949
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,730
I'm trying to figure out how you return.

950
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,590
Get back here, Gramps.

951
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,910
I gotta stop violence with violence.

952
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:30,990
Oh, no.

953
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,410
All right.

954
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:33,070
It's okay.

955
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,770
I got this.

956
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,130
It's all right.

957
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,470
I still have a bar.

958
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,410
All right, is he dropping it?

959
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,270
Where is it?

960
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:44,430
Oh, nice.

961
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,430
I dropped... he dropped it.

962
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,010
Oh my god.

963
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,330
Who would have thought driving is so hard?

964
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,390
Guys, I have a driver's license.

965
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:53,210
Boom.

966
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,950
All right, come on.

967
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,010
No, no, no, no.

968
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,470
All right, three.

969
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,430
Oh, sorry, Dad.

970
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,690
It's all right.

971
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,030
All right, nice.

972
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,330
You should have dropped another one.

973
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,670
Jesus Christ.

974
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,590
I need to do this nine more times.

975
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,030
Wait, not nine.

976
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:15,990
Six more times.

977
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:17,830
Oh my god.

978
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:18,190
Thank god.

979
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:18,450
Okay.

980
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,670
Come on.

981
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,350
Drop it.

982
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,030
Drop it.

983
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,350
Drop it.

984
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:23,910
Drop it.

985
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:24,630
Come on.

986
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:25,990
Drop the box.

987
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,610
Drop the box.

988
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:30,590
Wait, is that two?

989
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,590
Oh, shit.

990
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,850
God damn it.

991
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,130
Okay, that's two.

992
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:36,990
Nice.

993
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:38,550
All right, four more.

994
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,510
I can do this in a minute.

995
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44,030
Get over here.

996
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,250
Give me my free game.

997
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,510
Give me my free game.

998
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,550
Think of the children.

999
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,170
Children don't need this.

1000
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,210
I need it.

1001
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,330
Oh, shit.

1002
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:02,870
Oh, shit.

1003
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,310
Nice, I got it.

1004
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:03,750
One more.

1005
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,350
Get over here.

1006
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,690
I didn't pre-order the game, so I need to do this.

1007
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:13,850
Oh no, 25.

1008
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,630
25 seconds.

1009
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:17,810
Get over here.

1010
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,510
I need one more.

1011
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,450
I need one more on eBay.

1012
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,170
Nice, I did it.

1013
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,030
My Switch pre-ordered.

1014
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:26,410
No.

1015
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:32,390
All right, now I'm gonna- This is- This is how I scalp, guys.

1016
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:38,310
Yippee!

1017
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,310
Okay, thank you for the five gift-a-ships.

1018
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:42,610
Thank you.

1019
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:43,310
Thank you.

1020
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,470
All right, now to put them on eBay.

1021
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,660
I have to go back to work?

1022
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,000
Why?

1023
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,380
I have to go back to work.

1024
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,580
I just did my jo- I have to go back to work every day to get paid?

1025
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,680
That's a thing?

1026
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,760
It's not one- I ask myself every day.

1027
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,920
What do you mean I have to go back?

1028
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,400
I just- I was there yesterday.

1029
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,020
Too real.

1030
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,080
All right, time to go back to work, I guess.

1031
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,400
What's the point?

1032
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,480
They're never gonna go to college anyway.

1033
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,380
They're gonna be 10 forever.

1034
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,180
Also, if you work at a power plant, do you get like discounts?

1035
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,740
You know, like employee discount for energy?

1036
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,740
I feel like that should be a thing.

1037
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,420
I should get like employee discount.

1038
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,000
Didn't Lisa go to college?

1039
00:53:59,100 --> 00:53:59,460
No.

1040
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,140
Technically, it's like a vision.

1041
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:09,280
She didn't actually- She gets a vision that she's going to college, but she's not actually gonna go to college.

1042
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,120
Yeah, it's in my electricity bill.

1043
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,380
I'm literally providing energy, so I should get employees discount.

1044
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,320
How come like other employees get discount for like the place at work, but I don't for the power plant?

1045
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,940
You look like you're having one of your trademark adventures.

1046
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,460
Danger!

1047
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,740
Mr. Burns!

1048
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:29,760
Mini cameras!

1049
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,840
Black Vans!

1050
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,720
Oh, good thing I'm drunk.

1051
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,680
Stupid drunk.

1052
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,420
Oh no!

1053
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,240
Won't somebody think of the children?

1054
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,280
Acho, thank you for the super chat.

1055
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,400
Thank you, thank you.

1056
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,720
Beat Smitters to Mr. Burns' mansion?

1057
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,820
Oh, I'm so good at racing cars.

1058
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,880
It's okay.

1059
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,480
I know what shortcuts are.

1060
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,740
Ooh, the vibration's tickling my feet.

1061
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,140
All right, don't worry.

1062
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,780
I can beat him.

1063
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,100
I don't know where exactly it is, but I can beat him.

1064
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,600
I know all the shortcuts.

1065
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,260
Hey, where are the shortcuts?

1066
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,380
There you go.

1067
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,180
Shortcut one.

1068
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,720
Oh, shit.

1069
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,500
It's okay.

1070
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,300
I know all the shortcuts, guys.

1071
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,760
Shortcut two.

1072
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,440
Oh, what?

1073
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,140
Wait, I went over!

1074
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,320
Ow, my head!

1075
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,340
All right, nice trick.

1076
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,780
Okay, I'm a little closer now.

1077
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,740
Ow, my head!

1078
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,720
All right, don't worry.

1079
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,200
I know shortcut number three.

1080
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,640
Somewhere.

1081
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Oh my god.

1082
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,500
Okay, maybe I still have to drive.

1083
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,120
Guys, maybe I actually have to open my eyes, guys.

1084
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,860
Okay, I know the cemetery doesn't work.

1085
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,620
All right, nice.

1086
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,520
Following the rules.

1087
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,720
That's not fair!

1088
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,730
Why can't I do that to him?

1089
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:58,810
It's fine.

1090
00:55:59,090 --> 00:55:59,930
That's fine.

1091
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:05,050
All right, maybe I should have got the rocket car when everybody was yelling at me to get the rocket car.

1092
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,150
Where the fuck does Burns live?

1093
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,610
I don't know where my boss lives.

1094
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,590
Okay, he's not gonna use this shortcut.

1095
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:15,270
Yippee!

1096
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,690
All right, that is the only shortcut I- Guys, confession.

1097
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,650
That is the only shortcut I know.

1098
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,570
Is it here or the right side?

1099
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:27,630
I can't tell.

1100
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,750
All right, this way.

1101
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,690
And I assume it's this way.

1102
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,110
I don't know where he lives.

1103
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,810
Why would I know where my boss lives?

1104
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:43,890
Workday ends...

1105
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,210
Ends when work is over.

1106
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,270
Wait, what the fuck?

1107
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,850
How did he get there before me?

1108
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:51,970
Oh no.

1109
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:52,810
Oh no.

1110
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:53,750
Oh no.

1111
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,710
I'm trying to figure out where he lives.

1112
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,750
Okay, it's this way.

1113
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,810
And then it should be this way.

1114
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,690
Oh my god, he's literally right behind me.

1115
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,090
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1116
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,890
No, not the stupid school bus!

1117
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,450
Kids, get out of the way!

1118
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,450
This is more important!

1119
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:18,390
All right, I got there.

1120
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,530
Mr. Burns!

1121
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:21,890
Oh, sorry.

1122
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,990
Mr. Burns!

1123
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,990
He called me.

1124
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,150
Thank you, Mr. Chad.

1125
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:35,630
Thank you.

1126
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:36,390
Thank you.

1127
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,370
Turkey says she has a license.

1128
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,450
I big doubt.

1129
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,210
Huh?

1130
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:51,770
Release the hounds.

1131
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:56,210
And if this oaf is an employee of the plant, fire him at once.

1132
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:57,290
Oh.

1133
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,770
No, I'm not an employee there.

1134
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,870
I did it, guys!

1135
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:07,070
I 100% completed the level!

1136
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,930
Guys, does it look like I completed it 100%, guys?

1137
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:16,810
Does it look like that?

1138
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,650
Low-level employee harasses...

1139
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,410
Point on Bart, now.

1140
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:25,370
Hello!

1141
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:44,810
He won't expose me!

1142
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,690
Avoid Prince Drive to the Trion City before time runs out?

1143
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,850
In what car?

1144
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,330
I can drive?

1145
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,490
Oh, what's this glowing over here?

1146
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,490
Oh, money.

1147
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:00,150
Yay!

1148
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,050
Money!

1149
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,750
I love money.

1150
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,190
Oh, it's my rocket car!

1151
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,240
Nice.

1152
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,520
I have my own car.

1153
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,580
See, if Bart can drive, so can I.

1154
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:15,820
Sorry.

1155
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,310
All right, let's jump over this.

1156
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,040
Wait, am I going the right way?

1157
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,960
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

1158
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,920
Oh, I'm supposed to die!

1159
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,780
Oh, I'm supposed to make sure he doesn't get me.

1160
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,260
He doesn't touch me, okay.

1161
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,300
All right, give me a sec.

1162
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,980
I'm trying to run around as much as I can.

1163
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,200
There's Pauls everywhere!

1164
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,820
Why does the mayor keep spending money on hookers?

1165
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,200
Oh, he doesn't know I'm right here.

1166
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,020
He's so confused.

1167
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,660
I've lost him.

1168
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:03,480
Oh no.

1169
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,180
Oh no, he's getting closer, isn't he?

1170
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,780
It's okay.

1171
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,820
It's okay, everything is fine!

1172
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,240
He doesn't know where I am!

1173
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,520
It's okay, I can fix my car!

1174
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,300
Oh, fuck.

1175
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,700
Okay, um...

1176
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,980
It's okay, the cops don't know.

1177
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:22,780
Oh.

1178
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,900
Stop there!

1179
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,720
Why are the cops just there?

1180
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,800
What are they doing here?

1181
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,620
Go fix the fucking potholes!

1182
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,520
All right.

1183
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,200
Try and save.

1184
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Off to try and save I go, I guess.

1185
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,400
Where is it?

1186
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,380
Where's the try and save?

1187
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,540
Try and save?

1188
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,340
I'm gonna save my money if I don't know where it is.

1189
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,440
Oh, I drove like the long way.

1190
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,000
Think of them as little horses.

1191
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:11,960
All right.

1192
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,060
We're almost there.

1193
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,220
We're almost there.

1194
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,260
The moment I figure out how to drive in the straight line, we're almost there.

1195
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,740
Holy shit, it's so far!

1196
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,140
Wait, this map is a lot bigger than I expected for a very old game.

1197
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,060
Oh, nice!

1198
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:32,960
Hello, Jimbo.

1199
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,100
Okay, I should fix my car.

1200
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,940
Give me a sec, Jimbo.

1201
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:38,800
Truckasaurus.

1202
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,340
One month only.

1203
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,420
Always wanted to like watch like those truck shows.

1204
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,760
Like the destroy- like truck destroying shows.

1205
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,020
Oh, money!

1206
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,280
Free money!

1207
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,880
If the money touches the floor, it's free.

1208
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,340
I'm pretty sure I can't- Oh, shit!

1209
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,020
Oh, I thought I could play it.

1210
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,740
What are you gonna do?

1211
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,540
Call the cops?

1212
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,320
That's right.

1213
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,700
What are you gonna fucking do, Jimbo?

1214
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,860
Where's your mom now, huh?

1215
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,860
You're gonna bully me?

1216
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,200
That's fucking right!

1217
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:06,980
You're gonna bully me?

1218
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:07,620
Oh, fuck.

1219
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,220
Um, let's talk.

1220
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,200
Last game, four-finger discount.

1221
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,760
Some crazy lady destroyed all the rest.

1222
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,920
When will they learn?

1223
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,560
Video games don't kill people.

1224
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,980
They just kill their minds.

1225
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:21,740
Yeah!

1226
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,920
I am the king!

1227
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:24,940
I did it!

1228
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,680
Look at that.

1229
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,640
That's right.

1230
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,760
The cops won't save you now.

1231
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,740
That's fucking right.

1232
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,300
Who's gonna save you now?

1233
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,740
No one!

1234
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,740
The cops work for me.

1235
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,140
Oh, wait.

1236
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,500
I locked- I soft locked him.

1237
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,920
He's unkickable now.

1238
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,900
Oh, just cause- oh, now you're back to kick zone.

1239
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,200
That's right.

1240
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,520
That's right.

1241
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,200
You should've stayed in that zone.

1242
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,660
You should've stayed there and get soft locked.

1243
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,160
Oh, shit.

1244
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, shit.

1245
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:55,960
Oh, shit.

1246
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:56,840
Give me your taxi.

1247
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,380
Oh, shit.

1248
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,500
Give me your taxi.

1249
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,760
Don't worry, you can't catch me.

1250
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,240
Oh, fuck.

1251
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,580
Oh, no!

1252
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,230
My money!

1253
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,610
No!

1254
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:21,270
I mistimed it!

1255
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,430
You think I learned my lesson?

1256
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:25,670
That's fucking right.

1257
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,910
Get over here.

1258
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,230
I haven't learned shit.

1259
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,970
I now know I can afford the police by talking to you.

1260
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:33,050
That's right.

1261
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,130
I kicked too close to the side.

1262
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,970
Okay, weapons of- weapons of mass delinquency.

1263
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,370
Collect fireworks from around Springfield before time runs out.

1264
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,050
Avoid Chief Wiggum's.

1265
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:59,030
I mean, I've been doing really good at avoiding- At avoiding cops, guys.

1266
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,090
Shouldn't be that bad.

1267
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,470
Okay, I gotta go to Moe's.

1268
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,870
Give me your car, lady.

1269
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,350
Alright, we go this way.

1270
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:17,070
Off to see my dad at Moe's.

1271
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:21,430
Alright, here I go.

1272
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:27,630
I think I'm a very good driver after this game.

1273
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,570
Alright, here we go.

1274
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,650
And then I guess- I mean, we could go this way.

1275
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,230
Oh, what does auto want?

1276
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:40,330
Oh, I don't know.

1277
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,470
Hello, auto.

1278
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,250
Oh, shit.

1279
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:52,750
Nice.

1280
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:53,930
I got the fireworks.

1281
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,130
Is my dad here?

1282
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,350
Hey, Moe.

1283
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,230
Hello, Moe.

1284
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,030
Talk to me.

1285
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,610
I want to talk to you.

1286
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:11,230
Oh, hell yeah.

1287
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,190
Yay!

1288
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:15,730
More fireworks!

1289
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,650
Let's see...

1290
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,220
Where do I go next?

1291
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,720
Springfield Town Hall?

1292
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,620
Does the mayor sell fireworks, too?

1293
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,900
How deep does this firework corruption go?

1294
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,240
If I can't even trust the mayor, who can I trust?

1295
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:39,960
No!

1296
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,120
No way!

1297
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,840
Corrupted politicians?

1298
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,560
Say it ain't so!

1299
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,220
Oh no, I just need to talk to a criminal.

1300
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:53,980
That's...

1301
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,820
That's alright.

1302
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,440
Let me talk to a criminal real quick.

1303
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,940
Yeah, he's just a criminal.

1304
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,260
Alright, let us pick this real quick.

1305
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,200
There we go.

1306
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,580
And we got the wasps, too.

1307
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,420
Alright.

1308
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,160
We're out.

1309
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,020
Okay, police station.

1310
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,140
Wait, there's...

1311
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,080
Why would you sell in front of the police station?

1312
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,460
Oh, they're at the place you least expect it.

1313
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,420
I get it.

1314
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,200
The police will never look near the police station for illegal activities.

1315
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,140
That's so smart.

1316
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,900
It's like...

1317
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,080
They're like at the place you least expect.

1318
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,540
Yeah, they'll just think everybody will do legal things there.

1319
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,860
Not illegal stuff.

1320
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,100
Alright, let's see.

1321
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,500
Wait, does Ralph have fireworks?

1322
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,040
Hello, Ralph.

1323
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,360
Oh, your dad's there.

1324
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,080
What do you want to do, Ralph?

1325
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:26,540
Well, my daddy might also be going to jail with the stuff he does, so...

1326
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,500
Oh yeah?

1327
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,940
Give me your car!

1328
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,520
Oh, wait.

1329
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:37,800
Oh yeah?

1330
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,020
Give me your car!

1331
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,980
Oh, I can't steal his car.

1332
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,360
That's bad.

1333
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,060
This is bad.

1334
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,220
This is bad.

1335
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:44,720
Okay, wait.

1336
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,760
Wait, he doesn't chase me unless I get in a car.

1337
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,040
What if I never get in a car?

1338
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,220
Oh, a black van pizza delivery.

1339
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:51,900
Okay, look.

1340
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,700
It's good, guys.

1341
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,560
As long as I don't get in a car, he can't catch me.

1342
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,140
Wait, can I kick his car and it'll explode?

1343
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:03,960
Smart move.

1344
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,640
Yeah, I'll just walk across the city.

1345
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:08,760
Wait.

1346
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,720
Guys, there's a sprint button?

1347
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:24,280
Guys, I'll just walk back home, guys.

1348
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,400
I can walk home.

1349
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:37,420
All right, clearly, clearly my sprint button is not binded to any...

1350
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,460
Oh my god!

1351
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:38,740
What is this?

1352
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,140
It's not binded to anything.

1353
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,780
Okay, what's...

1354
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,700
Okay, now I have J button too.

1355
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,900
Oh my god!

1356
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,760
I could have...

1357
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,600
Oh my god!

1358
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,740
I could have ran a little bit faster.

1359
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,060
Can't catch me!

1360
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:57,740
Coppers!

1361
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,840
That's fucking right!

1362
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,810
If I just run back home...

1363
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,920
This is game-changing, guys.

1364
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,480
You can't catch me if I run back.

1365
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,840
Look at the speed.

1366
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:16,200
I'm almost as fast as a car.

1367
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,260
You'll never catch me.

1368
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:25,100
You have no legal right to arrest me when I'm not in a car.

1369
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,140
You can only...

1370
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,000
New slow running strategy.

1371
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,080
Run, Forrest, run!

1372
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,520
That's right!

1373
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,300
Move along, ladies!

1374
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,560
Exactly, it's hit and run.

1375
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,260
I'm merely running in my hit and run game.

1376
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,480
Yeah, they were jaywalking.

1377
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,800
I was just doing what the law couldn't.

1378
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,400
Also, I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

1379
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,400
I may or may not have to get in the car now.

1380
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,920
Don't worry, I'll steal this car.

1381
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,500
Wait, I did it!

1382
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,520
I did it!

1383
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,660
I just had to...

1384
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,600
I finished the mission!

1385
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,120
That's all I had to do.

1386
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,940
That's right, I'm a big brain.

1387
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:26,680
See?

1388
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,920
No one could understand my thought process.

1389
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,740
It's way beyond anybody's mind.

1390
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,920
Car jacked by a 10-year-old.

1391
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,040
And I'll do it again!

1392
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,440
And I missed.

1393
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:44,920
All right.

1394
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,440
Speedrunners in shambles.

1395
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,760
I want this comic book guy one.

1396
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:54,580
Hello.

1397
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,700
Hey, Jabba the Fat, do you know where I can get a copy of Bonestorm 2?

1398
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,740
Yes, I have no time to converse with you.

1399
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,320
I must be the first to register my disgust on the internet regarding the numerous films.

1400
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,440
The action was dismal and the nudity was frustratingly fleeting.

1401
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,640
I barely got through.

1402
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,600
Only it had more nudity.

1403
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,280
Yes, I suppose.

1404
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,740
But must we call it that?

1405
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,840
Race the nerd to the Java server?

1406
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,640
But where's my car?

1407
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,700
Wait, why am I...

1408
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,520
Oh, oh!

1409
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,700
I have to race him!

1410
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,040
Okay.

1411
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,880
Oh, the other nerd!

1412
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,340
I was like, wait, why am...

1413
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,700
Wait, I'm the nerd though.

1414
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,360
But there's more than one nerd?

1415
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,100
I thought there's a nerd limit in this town.

1416
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:45,220
Oh no, if only I was outside my car and running over right now.

1417
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:47,960
Oh, fuck.

1418
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,920
You know, like, comic book guy now has a wife and a child.

1419
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:59,640
If he can get a wife and a child, so, like, it's possible for anyone.

1420
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:05,160
Yeah, and he got a hot Japanese wife, too.

1421
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,180
Wait, I lost the race?!

1422
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,940
It's so close!

1423
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,280
Yeah, in the newest season, he has a hot Japanese wife.

1424
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,020
And a child.

1425
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,580
Bro, how the fuck do I win this race?

1426
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,180
Okay, there's no way for me to win this race, like...

1427
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:31,560
How?

1428
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,820
He's so fast!

1429
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:36,260
No!

1430
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,980
He's so fast!

1431
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,300
If I'm not crashing...

1432
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,040
What kind of driver do you think I am?

1433
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,220
Now you're gonna tell me to not breathe.

1434
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,280
Bro, it's not fair!

1435
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:54,020
He's cheating!

1436
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,260
My beautiful skull.

1437
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,380
This sucks.

1438
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,540
I'm out of here.

1439
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,240
Yeah, and then the wife chased after him, too.

1440
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,380
You're right, if he could get a hot wife, I can win this race.

1441
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,780
It's possible.

1442
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,700
I have to follow traffic rules to win a race?

1443
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,260
What the fuck's the point?

1444
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,460
Wait, he's not following traffic rules?!

1445
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,140
Yeah.

1446
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,560
Wait a minute!

1447
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,960
I was lied to!

1448
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,320
I didn't have to be an upstanding citizen!

1449
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:37,820
Okay.

1450
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,540
This is fair.

1451
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,240
No, no, no!

1452
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:43,800
I'm almost there!

1453
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:44,740
I did it!

1454
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:45,860
Nice.

1455
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,520
What?

1456
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,020
What?

1457
01:13:59,240 --> 01:13:59,940
No!

1458
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,120
I got scalped!

1459
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,420
No!

1460
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,940
I gotta play video games now!

1461
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:16,260
No!

1462
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,680
Now I have to be a productive citizen?

1463
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:23,760
A productive student?

1464
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,320
And do well in school?

1465
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,840
What's the point?

1466
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,840
What's the fucking point?

1467
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,980
I'm gonna beat up the elderly.

1468
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,320
If I can't get my video games...

1469
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,420
I'll start beating up the elderly.

1470
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,700
Give me my video games or this guy gets it!

1471
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,400
I get one more kick.

1472
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,580
All right, I gotta...

1473
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,880
Guys, I don't... I need to stop getting caught by the police so I can afford other cars.

1474
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,720
Of course, it's Moe, man.

1475
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,820
No one's gay for Moe, man.

1476
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,920
No one will miss him!

1477
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,120
Just give me a sec.

1478
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,240
I need to check my sound.

1479
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,240
All right.

1480
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:17,800
All right.

1481
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,220
Where's my car?

1482
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,820
Dude, where's my car?

1483
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,820
Oh, there it is.

1484
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:29,410
All right, time... I don't remember.

1485
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,970
Oh, time to head to the movie theater.

1486
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:34,610

1487
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,620

1492
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,960
Oh, the screen's frozen?

1493
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,000
Let me fix that.

1494
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,740
Sorry, tab down to run over Professor Frank.

1495
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,460
Give me a sec.

1496
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,860
I'm fixing it right now.

1497
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,780
Is it back?

1498
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:08,320
No!

1499
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,380
I can't fix it.

1500
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,800
Don't worry, I'll fix it.

1501
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,840
All right, uh...

1502
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,320
It should be fixed now?

1503
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,140
All right, is it fixed?

1504
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,860
Oh my god, game.

1505
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,020
Come on, game.

1506
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,280
He missed out on me running him over!

1507
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,300
No!

1508
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,500
I have to restart!

1509
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,340
No!

1510
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,700
Okay, don't worry.

1511
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,880
I broke my car, but it's okay.

1512
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,460
It's so dark, Doki.

1513
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:45,540

1514
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,140

1518
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,940
All right, save.

1519
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,100
Save successful.

All right, exit.

1522
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,560
All right, launch.

And then they're like, oh, I just can't tab out.

1524
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,240
Oh, I just can't tab out, I think.

01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,120

I don't know why it's like second nature.

1610
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,980
I just want to run instead of drive

1611
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:33,200
I Just can't help it don't you ever just want to run instead of drive like it's just second nature to me Where is this?

1612
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,100
Oh, it's over here.

1613
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:50,140
Wait, I think i'm faster I thought this was a free country I'm, not allowed to just kick people for fun One little assault and you get arrested like what is this?

1614
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:59,540
I like to speak to my lawyer All right, let me steal your car Where's your car dude, where's your car?

1615
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,400
Wait, he disappeared.

1616
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,480
Oh, wait, there he is Nothing is free here.

1617
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:35,000
All right Guys, I don't think i'm gonna be able to please afford anything else because I keep getting arrested I keep accidentally committing crime on accident too Like I don't understand I committed one felon and then I and then I marked as a criminal Like what happened to like boys will be boys It was just an accident

1618
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:44,280
All right I can make it Oh my god, I made it.

1619
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,660
I accidentally committed one felony, and then I'm marked as a bad person.

1620
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,300
What happened to the justice system?

1621
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,820
You actually made it, wow.

1622
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:05,400
Huh?

1623
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:23,230
Let the flat meat before times runs out, avoid a poo?

1624
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,790
Why does he like it?

1625
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,450
I'm just cleaning the environment.

1626
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:32,210
Move out of the way!

1627
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,290
Get out, beep beep!

1628
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:41,050
Where's that poo?

1629
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:42,270
I thought he doesn't like it.

1630
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:45,030
It's okay, I'm cleaning the environment.

1631
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:46,430
I'm cleaning the streets.

1632
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:50,710
If I didn't start eating them, who would in society?

1633
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:55,830
What would the people do if I didn't pick them up?

1634
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,510
I'm literally doing community service right now.

1635
01:25:59,130 --> 01:25:59,930
Oh no, please.

1636
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:00,890
Move out of the way!

1637
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:02,450
I have the right of law!

1638
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:06,930
There we go.

1639
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:11,330
And then there's another skunk over here.

1640
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:13,210
Yay!

1641
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:15,550
But how do I get out of here?

1642
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:16,490
Oh, there it is.

1643
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:23,590
There's a surprisingly a lot amount of skunks in Springfield.

1644
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:25,330
Wait, 20 seconds?

1645
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:29,170
You didn't even give me that much time to collect them!

1646
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:34,450
13, 12, 13.

1647
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:35,530
Okay, I need one more.

1648
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,050
Where's the last skunk?

1649
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,710
It won't matter if Quimby Heath votes for you.

1650
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:44,990
Deliver the skunk meat to the Krusty Burger?

1651
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:48,290
You know what?

1652
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,430
If we're able to eat horse meat, we can eat skunk meat too.

1653
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,130
I've always wanted to try roadkill.

1654
01:26:56,770 --> 01:26:59,430
Like, I'm just wondering... Okay, but if you cook it enough...

1655
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:03,070
Because like, the thing about roadkill is that you're worried about bacteria, right?

1656
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:04,770
And I guess rabies.

1657
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:06,910
But can you cook the rabies out?

1658
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:10,830
Is it possible?

1659
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:14,990
Because like, if you cook something enough, it kills the bacteria, right?

1660
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:20,630
So like, can you cook the parasites and rabies out of the meat?

1661
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,330
And you cook it long enough?

1662
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,250
And you boil it long enough?

1663
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:28,130
I don't have sleep for this.

1664
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:29,330
Bullshit.

1665
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,370
I'm just saying.

1666
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,130
I'm just saying.

1667
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:36,470
It's good for the environment because you're not wasting food.

1668
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,750
Oh shit, I have nine seconds.

1669
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:40,610
Oh, fuck.

1670
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:41,990
Okay, six.

1671
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:44,790
No, no, it's on the other side!

1672
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:46,910
No!

1673
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:47,630
No!

1674
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,320
No!

1675
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,800
Please, I'm broke!

1676
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,800
I'm broke!

1677
01:27:59,380 --> 01:27:59,840
Please!

1678
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,000
Please!

1679
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,620
I have no money!

1680
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,280
Please!

1681
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:06,800
Please!

1682
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,760
Oh, I did it.

1683
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,120
Okay, but I'm still being... I'm still being chased by the police.

1684
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,760
That's fine.

1685
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:14,960
That's fine.

1686
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,260
The Krusty Krab is right here.

1687
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,420
That's okay.

1688
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:28,920
Okay, if parasites lay eggs, I can just cook the eggs dead, right?

1689
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,340
As long as I boil the food, the parasites die.

1690
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,460
Oh no.

1691
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,440
Oh no.

1692
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:39,900
No!

1693
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,580
Okay, he can't catch me if I'm in the mission complete.

1694
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:43,760
Oh my god, he disappeared.

1695
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:48,340
Wait, his car's gone.

1696
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:51,720
I don't like the pizza van.

1697
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,060
I feel like they're not actually delivering pizza.

1698
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:57,400
I'm not sure though.

1699
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,600
You don't know if it doesn't work or not.

1700
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,860
You never tried it.

1701
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,760
How would you know you never tried it?

1702
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,720
It's all about... science is all about experimenting.

1703
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:16,000
And I'm asking the real questions here.

1704
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,220
How have you been able to live this long?

1705
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1706
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,060
Thank you, thank you.

1707
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,760
But like...

1708
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,920
You don't know if it's okay or not.

1709
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,420
You're just too afraid to try it.

1710
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,860
You're too stuck in your ways.

1711
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,520
Where's my video game?

1712
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:43,700
Where's my video game?

1713
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,040
People have tried it.

1714
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:56,760
Who's people?

1715
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,280
Who are they?

1716
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,300
Get a blender.

1717
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,940
Dr. Nick, he loves blended girl drinks during surgery.

1718
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:08,460
Of course.

1719
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,040
Hi, everybody.

1720
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,980
Hi, Dr. Nick.

1721
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,220
All right, but hillbillies turned out okay.

1722
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:25,380
All I'm saying, they came out just fine.

1723
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:30,990
Where's Dr. Nick?

1724
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:32,390
Dr. Nick!

1725
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:38,530
I need a blender that you use to definitely not blend people.

1726
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:41,150
Hi, Dr. Nick.

1727
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:42,270
Hi, everybody.

1728
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:44,150
You seem like a heavy drinker.

1729
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:44,750
Do you have a blender?

1730
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:45,990
Not now, okay?

1731
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,590
My monkeys have escaped.

1732
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:49,130
No, not the monkeys.

1733
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,730
I'll be so grateful.

1734
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:52,390
Why won't they come back to you?

1735
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:52,790
Yeah.

1736
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:55,190
I have tortured them horribly.

1737
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:55,810
Oh!

1738
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,550
Don't worry.

1739
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:04,870
Everyone will definitely forgive you.

1740
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:08,190
Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot.

1741
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:08,910
No!

1742
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:10,750
Wait, no, I already own.

1743
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:11,130
Wait.

1744
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,190
Wait, it's the plow machine.

1745
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:14,990
I already own that, right?

1746
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,030
Wait, don't I own that already?

1747
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:20,670
It's the plow machine.

1748
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:22,230
No.

1749
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:27,150
What do you mean getting caught by the police was not it?

1750
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:29,830
Oh, no, he wants a...

1751
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:33,350
What did he... What am I supposed to... Mr. Oh, it's Mr. Plow.

1752
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:36,150
Oh my god, I could just get the plow king.

1753
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,190
It's literally that car, but better.

1754
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:43,190
Guys, I think maybe...

1755
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:47,170
Maybe getting caught by the police was not it.

1756
01:31:52,150 --> 01:32:01,030
If I knew that getting arrested was a bad idea, I wouldn't have got arrested.

1757
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:10,730
If coins were so important, then why is the legal system around?

1758
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:16,950
Why did they put a legal system in this game?

1759
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:18,810
She's so...

1760
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:20,110
Real for that.

1761
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:25,050
All right.

1762
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:29,050
Let me start kicking things.

1763
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,390
Give me your money.

1764
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:32,390
Get over here.

1765
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:35,310
Give me your money.

1766
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:39,970
I need 200 coins or your family's gonna die.

1767
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,490
Oh, wait, I might lose all the coins I get.

1768
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:46,150
Toki the philosopher.

1769
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:46,950
Hahaha.

1770
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:54,330
Don't worry, I learned my lesson.

1771
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:58,770
I won't get arrested again for the next five minutes.

1772
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:01,670
Please only give me one coin.

1773
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:03,170
It's not fair.

1774
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:05,590
I can kick one person.

1775
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:07,670
Hahaha.

1776
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,110
I can kick this.

1777
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:14,910
All right, nice.

1778
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:16,150
That gives me two coins.

1779
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:18,350
There has to be more.

1780
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:19,330
Oh, there's more.

1781
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,550
All right, we get this.

1782
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,010
There you go.

1783
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:28,930
That should be like at least 200.

1784
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,810
I know they should be paying me.

1785
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:35,850
It's an honor to get like being kicked by Toki.

1786
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:38,830
Okay, I need another...

1787
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,710
I need another like...

1788
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:44,950
Piece of like Duff Cola or Buzz Cola.

1789
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:50,770
Wait.

1790
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:52,690
I hear...

1791
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:55,150
Oh, no, that's just the surveillance cameras.

1792
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:56,730
I thought I heard something.

1793
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,110
Oh, there's more coins there.

1794
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:58,390
Wait.

1795
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:01,430
I can beat the vending machines up.

1796
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:02,470
This is two coins.

1797
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:05,430
And then...

1798
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,390
There should be another...

1799
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:09,470
Boom, boom, boom.

1800
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:10,590
All right, that's another...

1801
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:13,310
It's another 170.

1802
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:15,150
All right, and then...

1803
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:18,470
This should be more.

1804
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:24,390
I thought I saw like a box of Duff Cola here or Buzz Cola.

1805
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:26,830
God damn it.

1806
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:31,550
Oh...

1807
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:33,490
I guess...

1808
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:36,550
Ralph Wiggum seems like an easy race.

1809
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:40,470
But then that requires me to try.

1810
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:44,190
Why try when I can just rob people?

1811
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:45,770
Hi, Ralph.

1812
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:51,350
A car?

1813
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:56,130
Pass all checkpoints and don't destroy your vehicle.

1814
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:00,830
All right, this can't be that difficult.

1815
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:01,970
Wait, there's three of them.

1816
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,430
That's fine.

1817
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:04,550
My car is faster.

1818
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,810
It's fine.

1819
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:11,310
I can... It's fine.

1820
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:13,030
This is salvageable, guys.

1821
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,150
This is salvageable.

1822
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:16,470
We can fix this.

1823
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:17,610
Don't worry.

1824
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:18,770
We can fix this.

1825
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,550
It can't be that fast.

1826
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,830
I know all the shortcuts, guys.

1827
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:27,470
Watch this.

1828
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:31,710
I know all the shortcuts.

1829
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:32,830
It's gonna be there soon.

1830
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:34,150
Oh my god.

1831
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:35,690
He's cheating.

1832
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:38,830
I was gonna do that.

1833
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:45,490
Where's the other checkpoint?

1834
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:46,770
Oh, it's over here.

1835
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,120
Wait, am I supposed to... Oh, I'm supposed to go up.

1836
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:52,360
Okay.

1837
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,220
No, no, no.

1838
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,060
We can turn this around.

1839
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,320
We can turn this around.

1840
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:00,440
I...

1841
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,500
Wait, I can force them off.

1842
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,780
Okay, guys.

1843
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:09,840
Guys, this might be... This might be really difficult.

1844
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,400
All right, race this might not be it, guys.

1845
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:21,880
I just need to... Okay, as long as I don't get caught by the police...

1846
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:24,400
Everything will be fine.

1847
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,500
I just won it.

1848
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,360
Thank you for the magenta soup.

1849
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,020
Thank you.

1850
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:29,560
Thank you.

1851
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:33,200
They do it to prevent virus and bacteria transmission from...

1852
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,900
bloody prep work.

1853
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,180
Wait, what's this?

1854
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,480
Do you think they have extra coins?

1855
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,480
More contact with humans means a mutation that can infect humans...

1856
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,820
reaches us and replicate.

1857
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,100
This is how HIV, bubonic plague, COVID, mad cow, bird flu, and etc.

1858
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,580
get to us.

1859
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,320
Yeah, but like I'm built different.

1860
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:59,180
I survived all of those.

1861
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,460
Why don't you have money at the DMV?

1862
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,040
No, you are not.

1863
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,940
How do you know that, huh?

1864
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:15,500
Wait.

1865
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,470
Let's just grab this real quick.

1866
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:23,990
I feel like I might need it.

1867
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:25,790
Get out of here, Krusty.

1868
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:29,750
Okay, we need to buy...

1869
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:34,870
We need to be able to afford the Plow King or Mr. Plow.

1870
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,170
Wait, he wants to talk to me.

1871
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,700
Hey, hey, Grandpa!

1872
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,420
Which war, though?

1873
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,660
I didn't think I'd need it.

1874
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,080
Collect the blood for Grandpa.

1875
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,180
Okay, that's fine.

1876
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:13,860
Wait, if I run over people, then that's... that's easy blood.

1877
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,940
Why do I have to collect blood when I can just get it from the people I run over?

1878
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,280
No, Toki.

1879
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:26,520
That's free blood!

1880
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,560
They're not gonna need it.

1881
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,860
They might be dead.

1882
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:34,040
Or an organ... they might be organ donors.

1883
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,440
Okay, at least right here.

1884
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,820
We can't... we won't find out unless we run them over.

1885
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,040
Wait, where's the blood?

1886
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,340
Where's my free bag of blood?

1887
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:51,960
Wait, enter bows.

1888
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:52,640
Okay, nice.

1889
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,140
Sorry.

1890
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,280
Sorry, Grandpa.

1891
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:55,200
I got a new mission.

1892
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,340
Yeah, that's just like human blood.

1893
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:09,700
Yay, I did it!

1894
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,860
Not so deadpool.

1895
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1896
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:15,820
Thank you.

1897
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,260
Thank you, Toki.

1898
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,480
I'm built different.

1899
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,320
Is sick with a cough or worse?

1900
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,720
90% of the... yeah, but it wasn't COVID!

1901
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,100
Or the bubonic plague!

1902
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,500
Um, it's just a regular cold.

1903
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:28,780
Blood!

1904
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,680
Only... the only sickness that can get me is weak... the weak sickness.

1905
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,980
Okay, wait, I need to grab money from this.

1906
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,340
I never got bird flu!

1907
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:50,000
It's just because my body is not good against like...

1908
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,460
the cold... the common cold.

1909
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:53,520
It's so common.

1910
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,540
It's just too common.

1911
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,360
Nice.

1912
01:39:59,140 --> 01:39:59,460
More blood.

1913
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,060
Okay.

1914
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,700
Oh, I just need to take it back to Grandpa.

1915
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:06,900
Grandpa!

1916
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,820
I got your legal blood!

1917
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:18,480
Yeah, I'm so strong that I just don't know how to fight the weak because I'm not... my body was never trained for that.

1918
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:22,180
It got... yeah, it's so weak.

1919
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,420
It got through my filter.

1920
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,160
All right, let's see.

1921
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,100
Beep beep.

1922
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:35,860
Beep beep.

1923
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,980
My 99% human blood for Grandpa.

1924
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,420
Grandpa, look!

1925
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:46,100
I got it!

1926
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,740
Here you go, Grandpa!

1927
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,700
Yay!

1928
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,940
Wait, that's a bonus mission!

1929
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,420
You've unlocked Grandpa's World War 2 vehicle.

1930
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,260
Yippee!

1931
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,340
What does it look like?

1932
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:18,220
This deserves to be in a museum, but instead I'm gonna drive in and crash the car!

1933
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,120
Hey, Grandpa!

1934
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:27,740
You know, we could be millionaires if we sold this car, but instead let's fucking destroy... let's destroy it actually.

1935
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,820
All right, Grandpa.

1936
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,820
This is what World War 2 would have wanted.

1937
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,580
All right.

1938
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,920
Yeah, oh my god, you're right!

1939
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:38,900
Anyone I hit...

1940
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,320
Anyone I hit will be in the museum!

1941
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:43,440
Oh no, no!

1942
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:44,260
I just got my money!

1943
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:45,000
No!

1944
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:46,740
Grandpa, run!

1945
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,740
I just got... I just got $250!

1946
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,520
I forgot about the police!

1947
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:54,060
No, I forgot!

1948
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,580
I just got $50!

1949
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,220
Don't let him get me!

1950
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:00,920
Please!

1951
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,200
I just got $50!

1952
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:03,400
$50!

1953
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,020
No!

1954
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,840
Grandpa, no!

1955
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,240
I just got $50!

1956
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:08,120
I can't!

1957
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,720
I can't go back!

1958
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,120
I can't go back, Grandpa!

1959
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:13,460
Please!

1960
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,820
Please don't make me go back!

1961
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,640
Don't make me go back!

1962
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,380
Not the money!

1963
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:26,900
Please!

1964
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,620
Please!

1965
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,680
No, I just got out!

1966
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:32,220
No!

1967
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,910
Not the money!

1968
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:45,950
Stupid car!

1969
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:49,370
Stupid fucking car!

1970
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,690
Stupid car!

1971
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:53,810
Explode!

1972
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,690
You've been nothing but trouble!

1973
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:59,110
That's right!

1974
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,150
You lose money?

1975
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:08,830
You lose money?

1976
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:11,810
You lose money?

1977
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:13,910
You lose money?

1978
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:20,150
What do you mean?

1979
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:24,170
No!

1980
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:28,650
I fixed the car and I fixed Grandpa.

1981
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:32,330
Oh my god!

1982
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:34,490
That's not fair!

1983
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:37,970
That's not fair!

1984
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:40,330
I don't want his car anymore!

1985
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:44,590
Why would I lose money?

1986
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:46,710
For exploding a car?

1987
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:49,130
Like, what?

1988
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,590
For property damage?

1989
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:53,770
This entire game is property damage!

1990
01:43:55,410 --> 01:43:57,230
That's not fair!

1991
01:43:57,830 --> 01:44:00,050
Like, who am I giving my money to?

1992
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:02,850
The government?

1993
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:06,430
My actions have consequences?

1994
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:09,670
I'm here to escape reality!

1995
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:12,110
Not give the government my money!

1996
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:18,250
Alright, hey Professor Frank.

1997
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:24,770
I need to drive to the screaming monk.

1998
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:25,910
Oh, I have to do this again?

1999
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:29,690
It like restarted my mission.

2000
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,660
Your insurance is going up?

2001
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,560
What insurance?

2002
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:43,920
You guys have insurance?

2003
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:48,500
Alright.

2004
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:50,260
Hello everybody!

2005
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,240
Where is Homer?

2006
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,900
Where is this fatass?

2007
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,920
There he is.

2008
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:57,600
What?

2009
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,720
Wait, what?

2010
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:00,780
Really?

2011
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:02,960
Okay.

2012
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,420
I had to double take that.

2013
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:11,340
I wanted to see what it said.

2014
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:15,740
Alright.

2015
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,200
Insane sigh.

2016
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,880
I was curious.

2017
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,440
I was like, did it actually say what I just saw it said?

2018
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:30,260
Okay.

2019
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:31,460
There has to be like...

2020
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:36,180
There has to be like some areas with some coins somewhere.

2021
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:37,280
Here.

2022
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,820
Why didn't anybody stop me?

2023
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:49,420
Guys, why did no one stop me from committing crime?

2024
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,000
Okay.

2025
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,360
99...

2026
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,880
Are you fucking kidding me?

2027
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:57,940
Are you okay?

2028
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,000
Oh my god, you destroyed the phone.

2029
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,160
Okay, that's property damage right there.

2030
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,900
That's property, that's 200.

2031
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,880
There you go, my one coin.

2032
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:09,280
As long as I don't commit...

2033
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,000
As long as I don't commit any more crime...

2034
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:14,240
It should be fine.

2035
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:16,140
As long as I don't...

2036
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:18,280
Commit any more crime...

2037
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:19,860
Everything will be okay.

2038
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,900
Alright, there you go.

2039
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:23,000
Last crime.

2040
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,820
That's fucked up!

2041
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:35,540
I'm just... I'm in elementary school!

2042
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,360
Zero dollars.

2043
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,440
Collect the monkeys before time runs out.

2044
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,740
Then...

2045
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,600
Get the blender from Dr. Nick.

2046
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,220
Okay.

2047
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,200
Okay.

2048
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,580
I gotta get Mr. Plow.

2049
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,180
Mr. Plow.

2050
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:53,540
That's my name.

2051
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:55,060
Oh no, it's the crazy monkeys.

2052
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,400
How many crazy monkeys are there?

2053
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:06,540
What the fuck, they're everywhere!

2054
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:09,060
Come on, crazy monkeys.

2055
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,140
Go back to your abusive owner.

2056
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,660
Hey!

2057
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:16,120
That's a lot of monkeys.

2058
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,140
Oh my god, there's like 30 of them.

2059
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,580
Oh, I can get through this.

2060
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,340
Alright, where else?

2061
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:35,580
Hello, crazy monkeys!

2062
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,460
Don't worry!

2063
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:38,560
Don't worry!

2064
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,460
He abuses you because he loves you!

2065
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:46,580
So go back to the crazy monkeys hospital.

2066
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:53,560
Oh shit, nice money.

2067
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,720
Lots of money.

2068
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,460
Yay!

2069
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,320
Alright.

2070
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:05,860
I'm halfway there.

2071
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,660
And he really loves you.

2072
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:13,740
Come on, you can trust the doctor.

2073
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,740
Yeah, I can't be bothered.

2074
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,220
You can live for free, Wasp.

2075
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,400
You'll get to live there.

2076
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,040
Ba dum.

2077
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,260
Ba dum.

2078
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,280
Ba dum.

2079
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:29,240
Ba dum.

2080
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,440
Ba dum.

2081
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:34,000
Ba dum.

2082
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,100
Ba dum.

2083
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,840
Wait, can I get out of the car?

2084
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,620
I have to be able to, there's no way.

2085
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,940
This is literally like, up top.

2086
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:44,080
Alright.

2087
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,120
We're almost there, we need 10 more!

2088
01:48:58,620 --> 01:48:59,500
10 more!

2089
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:00,100
Alright.

2090
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,760
6 more!

2091
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,300
Jesus fucking Christ.

2092
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:11,340
This side.

2093
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,600
First time I see this side.

2094
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,000
5 more!

2095
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:21,800
No!

2096
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,660
Get up the stairs!

2097
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,480
Come on!

2098
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,240
You think stairs will stop my car?

2099
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,300
I paid $200 for this.

2100
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:41,720
Alright.

2101
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:47,240
Stairs are meant to be driven up by cars!

2102
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:51,200
They're like little ramps for us.

2103
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:57,760
Alright, one more.

2104
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,860
Wait, where's the last monkey?

2105
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,060
Ba dum.

2106
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,360
Ba dum.

2107
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,180
Alright, time to put them back into a monkey medical research center.

2108
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,400
Don't worry, monkeys!

2109
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:14,940
They're going back home to a very loving and abusive father!

2110
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,060
But that's how he shows love!

2111
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,200
Hi, Dr. Nick!

2112
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:28,780
Yippee!

2113
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:33,380
They make the brain go happy!

2114
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:39,290
Drive to the stadium?

2115
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:41,130
Okay, back to the stadium I go.

2116
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:45,810
Alright.

2117
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:49,670
Time to give Professor Frank the...

2118
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:50,330
a blender!

2119
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:51,510
Oh, it's right here!

2120
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:53,970
Nerd spotted.

2121
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:16,050
And that's bad.

2122
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,870
Why?

2123
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:19,210
Just...

2124
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,730
Just say you didn't do it!

2125
01:51:21,690 --> 01:51:25,110
Destroy all the cell phone users' cars before time runs out?

2126
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:26,570
Alright, let me get water real quick.

2127
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:27,650
I'll be right back, guys!

2128
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:29,450
I ran out of water!

2129
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:33,270
I gotta stay hydrated if I want to commit more...

2130
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,170
illegal crimes.

2131
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:12,740
Hey, I'm back!

2132
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,140
Don't worry.

2133
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:17,400
I learned my lesson.

2134
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:20,820
I know what to do when the cops come.

2135
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:24,900
Watch this.

2136
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,720
Guys, this is what I'll do when the cops come.

2137
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:29,400
Watch.

2138
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:34,080
Get over here.

2139
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,860
I'm gonna use you as an example.

2140
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,060
Get over here.

2141
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,840
Get over here, nerd!

2142
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:41,420
That's right!

2143
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,160
Get your ass over here!

2144
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,060
Watch this, guys.

2145
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,800
Can't catch me.

2146
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,400
I'm not on it.

2147
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:53,740
I'm not in a car.

2148
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:55,100
That's right!

2149
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:57,300
Oh, you think you can catch me now?

2150
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,700
Oh, that's right!

2151
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:04,120
Okay,

2152
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:09,860
he can catch me.

2153
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,580
Oh shit, my mission!

2154
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:17,700
I forgot I have a mission to do.

2155
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,120
Oh shit, okay.

2156
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:26,260
I thought I juked him.

2157
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,440
Alright.

2158
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:31,100
I forgot I have an actual mission to do.

2159
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:35,320
I was too busy trying to prove a point.

2160
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,200
Alright.

2161
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,500
I thought...

2162
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,460
I thought...

2163
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:44,000
I thought the car would just be too fast.

2164
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:44,680
You know?

2165
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:50,970
God damn it.

2166
01:53:51,030 --> 01:53:52,010
What the fuck?

2167
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:54,150
Why are you driving away?

2168
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:57,390
Alright.

2169
01:53:57,930 --> 01:53:59,970
Look, I almost got away, guys.

2170
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:05,510
Okay, I can do this in 20 seconds.

2171
01:54:09,610 --> 01:54:10,650
Come on.

2172
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:12,050
Come on.

2173
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,450
Collapse on me.

2174
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:15,430
Come on!

2175
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:16,410
Do more damage!

2176
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:18,470
Why is it not doing any damage?

2177
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:20,090
Oh, I should have bought a better car.

2178
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:23,270
I just realized it's because I have a regular car.

2179
01:54:23,410 --> 01:54:26,030
I should have got Mr. Plow in here.

2180
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:27,290
No!

2181
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:30,030
Alright, let me grab Mr. Plow.

2182
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:33,770
Okay, wait, I can do this with this car.

2183
01:54:33,890 --> 01:54:34,190
Watch.

2184
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:36,030
There we go.

2185
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:39,970
And then...

2186
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:40,590
Fuck.

2187
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:43,670
I thought he...

2188
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:45,770
I thought he ran at me again!

2189
01:54:47,410 --> 01:54:49,270
Okay, we need Mr. Plow.

2190
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:51,630
It's fine.

2191
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,610
I'll do what Mr. Plow quoted.

2192
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:56,010
Destroy a car.

2193
01:54:58,330 --> 01:54:58,970
Oh!

2194
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:02,070
One more ram!

2195
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:03,990
Oh!

2196
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:05,790
There we go.

2197
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,450
I did it.

2198
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,970
Wait, I have to do another car?

2199
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:12,990
How many cellphones are in the city?

2200
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:16,190
I thought everybody in Springfield is poor!

2201
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:22,310
Oh, this car is not gonna be okay.

2202
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:33,770
I thought only Mr. Burns and the mayor and also the only doctor...

2203
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:36,450
Actually, no, Dr. Nick is also a doctor.

2204
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:39,810
The two other doctors in the city!

2205
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,530
Okay, I need to borrow another car.

2206
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:47,010
Alright, give me a...

2207
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:47,150
Oh!

2208
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:49,210
Um,

2209
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:54,090
rest in peace to that guy that died.

2210
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:55,790
Thoughts and prayers, guys.

2211
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:56,670
Thoughts and prayers.

2212
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:00,150
Okay, you should turn around here.

2213
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:02,470
So yeah, borrow another car.

2214
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:10,240
Alright, get over here!

2215
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,640
Oh no, two minutes.

2216
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,820
Oh no.

2217
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,660
Oh no.

2218
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:18,360
It's okay.

2219
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,360
Fuck!

2220
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:21,960
Get over here, please!

2221
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:28,020
Please, you don't understand!

2222
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:30,700
My dracones are watching!

2223
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,980
Wait, I'll intercept him here.

2224
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:36,900
He won't expect it.

2225
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:40,740
I did that much damage for interception?

2226
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,420
Alright, that's fine.

2227
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:47,020
That's fine.

2228
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:47,980
I think he knows, guys.

2229
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,580
Oh no, my money!

2230
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:52,800
It's okay.

2231
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,560
Wait, this is an unlimited money glitch!

2232
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,860
It gives me more money than it takes!

2233
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:02,580
It's an actual unlimited money glitch!

2234
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,140
I just gotta keep destroying cars!

2235
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,460
Okay, there has to be life.

2236
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,120
Let me borrow your car.

2237
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:21,150
Should show up here.

2238
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:22,650
There you go.

2239
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:25,370
I found the loophole, guys!

2240
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:31,190
Come on.

2241
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:34,510
Come on, crash into something!

2242
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:38,470
Come on, you just need to crash in one more time!

2243
01:57:40,090 --> 01:57:41,510
Come on, get over here!

2244
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:43,090
You don't need that car!

2245
01:57:44,150 --> 01:57:44,950
Oh shit.

2246
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:46,850
Oh shit.

2247
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:49,150
Please, literally just one hit.

2248
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:52,390
There we go.

2249
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:54,950
I have to destroy another one?!

2250
01:57:57,170 --> 01:57:58,130
Alright, don't worry.

2251
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,090
I figured it out.

2252
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:02,590
There we go.

2253
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:06,650
I figured it out.

2254
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:08,070
I know the pathway now.

2255
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:09,030
I know his pathing.

2256
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:18,230
He's gonna go this way, and then I go this way, and then he does a u-turn, and then I go this way, and I'll meet him on the other side.

2257
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:22,550
I know his pathing now.

2258
01:58:23,410 --> 01:58:24,830
And then I go...

2259
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:25,230
Boom!

2260
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:27,790
There we go.

2261
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:31,030
And I know where he's gonna go next, which is here.

2262
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:33,190
No!

2263
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:34,170
My car!

2264
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:37,170
Where did he go?

2265
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:38,510
I think he's gonna go here.

2266
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:41,210
Where did he go?

2267
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:44,070
I actually don't know where he's gonna go.

2268
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,470
Oh, he follows traffic laws!

2269
01:58:45,610 --> 01:58:46,510
Oh no, he doesn't.

2270
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:48,850
Come on!

2271
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:50,750
Yes!

2272
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:51,630
No!

2273
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:52,090
My car!

2274
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:57,620
Alright.

2275
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,080
See, I get more than I lose.

2276
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,920
I'm at like 50 coins now.

2277
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:07,740
Alright.

2278
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:07,860
Alright.

2279
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,900
We go again.

2280
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:15,440
God, how many cars are there?

2281
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:20,660
Okay, I know where he goes.

2282
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:25,140
He's gonna go here, and I'm gonna go here, and I'll meet him on the other side.

2283
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,020
Wait.

2284
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,000
Wait, there's no other side.

2285
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:29,460
I'm gonna meet him over here.

2286
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:30,500
I'll meet him on the other side.

2287
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:36,730
Nice.

2288
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:37,050
Okay.

2289
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:41,710
And then, he goes that way, so I go this way.

2290
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:45,170
That's right.

2291
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:49,050
And then he goes that way, so I go this way.

2292
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:50,490
Wait, okay, that's not it.

2293
01:59:52,630 --> 01:59:58,090
He goes that way, so I lost my sense of direction.

2294
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:59,830
So I go this way.

2295
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:03,170
And I'll meet him here.

2296
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:05,590
There we go.

2297
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:07,510
There we go.

2298
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:08,570
See, guys?

2299
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:09,570
I can read a map.

2300
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:14,230
And then he goes that way, and I go faster than him.

2301
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:16,070
Come on.

2302
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:17,110
Bump into that.

2303
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:17,830
Yes!

2304
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:20,030
I did it.

2305
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:21,250
Yippee!

2306
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,390
I destroyed all the cars.

2307
02:00:25,230 --> 02:00:25,750
Yippee!

2308
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:28,810
See, it's legal crime.

2309
02:00:29,170 --> 02:00:34,070
If the police didn't come and stop me, and the police didn't arrest me, then everything I did was legal.

2310
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,990
So...

2311
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,910
Alright, time to go home.

2312
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:43,590
Yippee!

2313
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:49,950
Oh, thank you for the superchat.

2314
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:51,050
Thank you, thank you.

2315
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:52,270
Look, there's a nerd.

2316
02:00:54,270 --> 02:00:54,690
Hello.

2317
02:00:57,790 --> 02:00:58,430
Nerd?

2318
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:01,670
What if I...

2319
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:04,850
What if...

2320
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:05,870
Okay, but like...

2321
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:11,310
I blame his computer navigation system.

2322
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:12,670
Jump the lightspeed!

2323
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,040
See, he's okay.

2324
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:21,280
He's okay, guys.

2325
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:24,580
Wait, wait, wait.

2326
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:25,760
Do I get...

2327
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:28,940
Okay, if I get more than $50, it's an unlimited money glitch.

2328
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:31,700
My coins are gone.

2329
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:35,420
My coins despawned!

2330
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:36,360
No!

2331
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:40,820
My coins despawned!

2332
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,940
Cause I looked away!

2333
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:48,960
Guys, it was an unlimited money glitch, guys.

2334
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:50,480
It wasn't.

2335
02:01:55,640 --> 02:02:00,000
It wasn't an unlimited money glitch.

2336
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:09,230
What?

2337
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:11,810
Who is that?

2338
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:13,590
A truck-in-saurus?

2339
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,340
Don't worry, I can drift.

2340
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:33,300
I did it!

2341
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:33,700
I lived!

2342
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:34,020
Dude!

2343
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,440
That song was written by Michael Jackson.

2344
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:40,980
Supposedly.

2345
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:42,560
Wait, what?

2346
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:43,800
Aliens?

2347
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:54,640
I didn't mute myself.

2348
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:56,300
I'm blowing my nose.

2349
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:57,640
Rare Doki moment.

2350
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:00,380
There's aliens in my game?

2351
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:06,380
Yes, please.

2352
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,880
Alright, now I should be Lisa, right?

2353
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,300
Hello, I'm Lisa.

2354
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:25,920
Do I have enough money?

2355
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:27,680
To afford anything?

2356
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:30,260
Oh, I have...

2357
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:33,080
Oh no, not Florida!

2358
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,420
Oh, I have cool Lisa.

2359
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:37,300
I wanna be Florida Lisa!

2360
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:39,200
Alright, guys.

2361
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:42,280
I will save my money for real now.

2362
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,040
Guys, I swear to God.

2363
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:44,880
Oh my God!

2364
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:46,920
Who the fuck died in there?

2365
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,560
Do I need to call somebody for that?

2366
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,020
Itchy and Scratchy Kiss?

2367
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:12,540
Where's the nerd?

2368
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,280
Get the comic book before time runs out.

2369
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:20,320
Oh my God, my fanfiction.net!

2370
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,540
It's real!

2371
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:24,020
Oh fuck, okay.

2372
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,160
These nerds are so good at driving.

2373
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:36,520
Oh no, not the cops!

2374
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,840
Please, I need to save money for real!

2375
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:42,260
I need to buy Florida!

2376
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:54,380
Please, if I lose the race, I'll be safe.

2377
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:57,260
I just need to lose the race, guys.

2378
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:00,420
Guys, it'll be fine.

2379
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,620
As long as I lose the race.

2380
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:04,260
Then I won't be caught.

2381
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,980
As long as I lose the race.

2382
02:05:07,820 --> 02:05:09,440
You can't catch me!

2383
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:12,320
If I lose the race, please!

2384
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:15,120
Please, how far away is this race?

2385
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,240
Why are we still racing?

2386
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:21,780
Oh, I'm safe.

2387
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,600
Oh, now I lost the race.

2388
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:25,980
Okay, alright.

2389
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,780
Now I lost the race.

2390
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:28,360
That's cool.

2391
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:36,300
That's alright, I guess.

2392
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:37,780
That's alright.

2393
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:42,500
There's no way I lose money if I lose the race!

2394
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:43,940
This is part of the mission!

2395
02:05:47,020 --> 02:05:48,640
It's part of the campaign!

2396
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:55,320
Oh my god, where are the shortcuts in this area?

2397
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,360
Okay, this one has to be a shortcut, right?

2398
02:05:59,560 --> 02:05:59,800
Yeah.

2399
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:03,940
What?!

2400
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:05,940
I got tollbooth?!

2401
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:12,450
Oh my god, oh my god, I missed the shortcut.

2402
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:14,430
I missed the shortcut, there was a shortcut over there.

2403
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:15,590
I missed it.

2404
02:06:16,090 --> 02:06:17,590
I got so confused.

2405
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:20,310
Oh my god, there it is!

2406
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:21,550
Wait, what?

2407
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,650
It was right here all along, why'd it take it forever?!

2408
02:06:30,610 --> 02:06:32,270
Okay, I got first place though.

2409
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:34,190
It's fine.

2410
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:35,850
I'm first.

2411
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:38,770
Finally.

2412
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:42,610
The writers knew exactly what I wanted.

2413
02:06:45,230 --> 02:06:46,590
Alright, here I go.

2414
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:48,670
This way.

2415
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:51,950
Oh, jazz!

2416
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:53,050
The jazz hole.

2417
02:06:53,710 --> 02:06:55,090
My favorite type of hole.

2418
02:06:58,270 --> 02:06:59,390
This way.

2419
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:09,410
I heard there's a mod that makes all the maps interconnected, which I thought was pretty cool.

2420
02:07:10,950 --> 02:07:14,010
And there's like a Spongebob mod.

2421
02:07:17,170 --> 02:07:17,890
Yay!

2422
02:07:35,410 --> 02:07:36,050
Haha!

2423
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:40,150
Ah, yes.

2424
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:42,690
The perfect business expense.

2425
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:47,250
Alright, drive to the Noiseland Arcade.

2426
02:07:47,990 --> 02:07:49,330
Wait, what are my cars?

2427
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,550
What are Lisa's cars?

2428
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:52,750
Lisa, what car do you own?

2429
02:07:53,550 --> 02:07:54,470
I need to know.

2430
02:07:58,860 --> 02:08:00,060
Dr. Milhouse?

2431
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:04,020
I don't know about that.

2432
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:06,860
Oh, I have a Malibu Stacy car?!

2433
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:08,580
Oh, that's cute!

2434
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:13,060
Book Burning Van?!

2435
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,040
Alright, I want my...

2436
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,780
Where's my Malibu Stacy car?

2437
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:17,900
Wait, where is it?

2438
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:19,980
There it is.

2439
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:28,080
Do I entertain Milhouse?

2440
02:08:39,410 --> 02:08:40,950
Oh my god, guys.

2441
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:42,810
Two dried toppings.

2442
02:08:44,850 --> 02:08:46,510
Holds two of them?!

2443
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:49,030
Follow Ms. Milhouse's clues to find Bart.

2444
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:50,330
Don't let time run out.

2445
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:53,110
Okay, but I just need to get in the vehicle, right?

2446
02:08:53,610 --> 02:08:56,530
Alright, but I need some cash, some moolah real quick.

2447
02:08:58,510 --> 02:08:59,170
Free money!

2448
02:08:59,890 --> 02:09:00,770
I need Florida.

2449
02:09:01,170 --> 02:09:03,690
I need to buy Florida, guys.

2450
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:05,230
Don't understand.

2451
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:08,670
When else can you buy Florida?

2452
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:12,550
Okay.

2453
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:14,150
Wait, it's just that?

2454
02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:16,770
I could've walked!

2455
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:19,010
This was a walking mission, Milhouse.

2456
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,330
Wait.

2457
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:21,690
Florida.

2458
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:24,290
I understand.

2459
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:30,610
Yeah.

2460
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:38,410
Wait, Maggie?

2461
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:45,630
Maggie, are you okay?

2462
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:48,730
Maggie!

2463
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:51,490
What's going on, Maggie?

2464
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:53,230
You don't look so good!

2465
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:55,150
That's like ten whole polygons!

2466
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:55,810
What?

2467
02:09:57,810 --> 02:09:58,530
Did I?

2468
02:09:58,630 --> 02:09:59,350
Oh, whoops.

2469
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:04,350
Now I don't feel as guilty anymore.

2470
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:11,190
Babies love the ball pit.

2471
02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:11,830
Yeah.

2472
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:15,510
It's alright.

2473
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:18,270
If I can't see her, I don't feel as guilty.

2474
02:10:19,130 --> 02:10:20,290
That's how it goes, right?

2475
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:23,890
Out of sight, out of mind.

2476
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:24,490
Exactly!

2477
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:27,850
If I don't see it, nothing bad happens.

2478
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:34,490
Alright, where do I have to go?

2479
02:10:35,490 --> 02:10:38,090
It's like Planet Hype or something?

2480
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:41,970
This way.

2481
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:45,950
Oh my god, it's the Mr. Burns Casino!

2482
02:10:46,830 --> 02:10:48,530
Wait, I thought they destroyed it.

2483
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:51,430
Oh, shit.

2484
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:55,370
For some reason, I thought I could drive over it.

2485
02:10:58,690 --> 02:11:00,270
Yeah, it was just an accident.

2486
02:11:00,630 --> 02:11:01,830
Who would ever push that lever?

2487
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:03,070
Oh shit, eight seconds.

2488
02:11:03,250 --> 02:11:04,990
I was doing a leisurely drive.

2489
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:06,950
It's okay, it's right here.

2490
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,810
Again?

2491
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:16,410
Yeah, you creep!

2492
02:11:21,690 --> 02:11:23,870
Aww, he's just trying to get...

2493
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:24,830
date night.

2494
02:11:25,190 --> 02:11:27,750
Like, five seconds of date night.

2495
02:11:29,550 --> 02:11:31,970
I know your plans, Milhouse.

2496
02:11:32,290 --> 02:11:35,870
Taking me to all these romantic spots for five seconds.

2497
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:38,510
It's not a date, Milhouse!

2498
02:11:40,570 --> 02:11:42,430
The indirect kiss.

2499
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:43,590
Oh shit, oh shit.

2500
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:44,730
The coppers might get me.

2501
02:11:45,190 --> 02:11:45,430
Don't worry.

2502
02:11:46,590 --> 02:11:48,390
What are you doing on my road?

2503
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:50,790
This is not pedestrian lane!

2504
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:52,950
Get away!

2505
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:53,930
Move!

2506
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:55,750
This is the lane for cars!

2507
02:11:57,970 --> 02:11:58,490
See?

2508
02:11:58,810 --> 02:12:00,670
It transitioned into the road.

2509
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:01,990
So this is a car lane.

2510
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:05,370
Everything is coming.

2511
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:07,790
No, it's called a board road.

2512
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:11,610
I don't know where you get these ideas.

2513
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:16,950
Move out of the way!

2514
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:19,070
I have the right of law!

2515
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:20,650
Oh shit.

2516
02:12:21,110 --> 02:12:23,110
I was driving too leisurely again.

2517
02:12:23,730 --> 02:12:24,550
I need to stop doing that.

2518
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:25,390
Please, please.

2519
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:27,210
Oh my god, I just made it!

2520
02:12:27,710 --> 02:12:28,670
Oh shit, there's Milhouse.

2521
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:32,050
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

2522
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:34,670
Exactly, it's a board drive.

2523
02:12:37,110 --> 02:12:37,830
Can I...

2524
02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:47,180
Wait, how do I talk to him now?

2525
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:49,920
Wait.

2526
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:53,320
Wait, I fucked up.

2527
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:54,980
Oh, there he goes.

2528
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:55,700
There he goes.

2529
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,840
Wait, that means I can do that again.

2530
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:02,940
Come on, get down.

2531
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,600
Oh no, an accident happened, guys.

2532
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:08,520
What do I do?

2533
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:09,880
Oh no.

2534
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:12,340
Somebody please save him.

2535
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:13,560
An accident happened.

2536
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:15,360
Oh, see, he's okay.

2537
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:18,220
Oh no, guys, another accident.

2538
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:23,860
Don't worry, I do that...

2539
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:24,580
and he's back.

2540
02:13:35,110 --> 02:13:36,470
Where is he?

2541
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:40,490
The Harvest Dance?

2542
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:44,510
Yeah,

2543
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:52,430
Fortnite emoted on Milhouse.

2544
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:54,950
Alright, maybe Appu knows where he is.

2545
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:57,330
Alright, Krusty Burger.

2546
02:13:58,010 --> 02:13:58,870
Wait, where is it?

2547
02:13:58,910 --> 02:13:59,590
Oh, it's this way.

2548
02:14:01,270 --> 02:14:06,370
The amount of times he comes in clutch at the last second is amazing.

2549
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:09,170
Everything coming up for Doki.

2550
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:11,530
Let's thank you for the super chat.

2551
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:12,670
Thank you, thank you.

2552
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:15,470
Nothing ever goes wrong for her.

2553
02:14:18,970 --> 02:14:19,590
Alright.

2554
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:25,770
I love the music for this game.

2555
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:27,370
It's just classic Simpsons.

2556
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:32,410
Oh shit.

2557
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:37,470
Please, I just wanna be able to afford Florida.

2558
02:14:37,570 --> 02:14:38,010
Oh!

2559
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:41,210
I can kick those.

2560
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:43,850
I need Florida.

2561
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:44,330
No!

2562
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,690
No!

2563
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:48,950
This is so cruel.

2564
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:52,310
They barred it away from me.

2565
02:14:54,730 --> 02:14:56,170
That's so fucked up.

2566
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,670
They know what I want.

2567
02:14:58,990 --> 02:15:02,130
They're dangling all that money in front of me.

2568
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:04,490
Don't eat beef ham, ahoy.

2569
02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:08,310
That's so messed up.

2570
02:15:08,770 --> 02:15:14,270
How could they just dangle all that delicious money in front of me like that?

2571
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:16,510
How could they just do that to me?

2572
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:19,130
So close, yet so far.

2573
02:15:22,070 --> 02:15:23,790
Oh my god, I'm so close.

2574
02:15:23,890 --> 02:15:25,030
I need 100 more coins.

2575
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:26,190
Alright, Appu.

2576
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:26,690
What do you want?

2577
02:15:34,330 --> 02:15:35,110
No!

2578
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:36,950
How could they do such a thing?

2579
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:45,530
How could they ruin this small business?

2580
02:15:46,330 --> 02:15:47,050
Are they racist?

2581
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:49,810
Get outta here!

2582
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:55,130
How could they?

2583
02:15:57,230 --> 02:16:00,950
How could they harm these small businesses like this?

2584
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:04,110
Oh wait, wrong car.

2585
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:05,090
Oh wait, no, I still hit him.

2586
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:05,570
Nice.

2587
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:07,030
Alright.

2588
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:08,970
Wait, he has such a nice car.

2589
02:16:09,370 --> 02:16:12,650
Wait, maybe your business does not- Wait a minute.

2590
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:16,130
Is your business not as small as I thought it was?

2591
02:16:16,450 --> 02:16:18,890
How the fuck are you able to have such a nice car?

2592
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:23,030
You know what?

2593
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:26,670
How dare they ruin a medium-sized business like Appu.

2594
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,870
Wait.

2595
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:35,230
Nice.

2596
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:38,930
Holy shit, how am I supposed to do like 15?

2597
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:44,370
Also, to be fair, how much does Appu fucking make?

2598
02:16:44,430 --> 02:16:46,370
I just realized he has 8 children.

2599
02:16:47,190 --> 02:16:48,270
He has 8 couplets.

2600
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:51,570
And a lovely arranged marriage wife.

2601
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:56,650
Please, I need- Please, I only have a minute.

2602
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:57,550
Please.

2603
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:00,170
Please, I only have a minute.

2604
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:03,090
Keep- Please.

2605
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:05,390
Drop some more roadkill.

2606
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,580
Get over here.

2607
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:13,240
Wait, what?

2608
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:14,920
That was a hit!

2609
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:17,960
Give me the meat!

2610
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:23,120
Give me the meat!

2611
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:27,720
Oh no, I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

2612
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:29,700
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

2613
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:33,500
Oh no.

2614
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:36,320
I need 3 more!

2615
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,420
Please, please!

2616
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:40,240
13!

2617
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:42,420
No!

2618
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:46,760
No!

2619
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,640
The closest!

2620
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:49,660
No!

2621
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:55,920
Drop the meat for the love of God!

2622
02:17:59,400 --> 02:17:59,940
Please.

2623
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:01,900
Please.

2624
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:03,360
I locked him in!

2625
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:05,720
I locked him in!

2626
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:11,640
Okay, I locked him in!

2627
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:13,160
But where did he go?

2628
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:16,240
But I locked him in!

2629
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:17,560
How did he get out?

2630
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:20,880
Oh no.

2631
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:25,580
Come on, give me!

2632
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:29,120
Please!

2633
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,720
Why did he have to do this on the highway?

2634
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:38,820
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it this time.

2635
02:18:39,460 --> 02:18:41,680
I am 1 minute in and I only have 4.

2636
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:45,800
Oh no.

2637
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:50,980
I'm on the wrong side of the road!

2638
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:55,820
God damn it.

2639
02:18:56,780 --> 02:18:58,120
This is a lot harder.

2640
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:00,980
He's not dropping as much.

2641
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,260
Keep dropping them!

2642
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,900
Maybe stay on the right lane?

2643
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,060
Look.

2644
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:19,440
Why would they make 4 lanes if I wasn't allowed to drive on all 4 of them?

2645
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:22,020
What's the point of having 4 lanes?

2646
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:25,580
Here we go.

2647
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:30,260
That's 4 open roads for me.

2648
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:32,620
All for me.

2649
02:19:36,010 --> 02:19:36,950
Drop them!

2650
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:37,930
Drop the meat!

2651
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:40,130
Drop the meat!

2652
02:19:41,470 --> 02:19:42,810
Drop the meat!

2653
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:45,330
Drop!

2654
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:51,410
Guys, I don't think I made it.

2655
02:19:51,550 --> 02:19:52,570
I don't...

2656
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:54,650
No!

2657
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:57,250
This one's a lot harder.

2658
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:05,070
Okay.

2659
02:20:07,350 --> 02:20:07,530
Okay.

2660
02:20:07,570 --> 02:20:07,770
Here we go.

2661
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:08,950
That should be another one.

2662
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:10,630
That should be another one.

2663
02:20:12,370 --> 02:20:12,910
Alright, alright.

2664
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:13,610
I got the strat in.

2665
02:20:13,650 --> 02:20:14,530
I got the strat, guys.

2666
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:16,790
I got the strat this time.

2667
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:18,850
It's fine.

2668
02:20:18,930 --> 02:20:19,790
I figured it out.

2669
02:20:21,310 --> 02:20:21,690
There we go.

2670
02:20:23,070 --> 02:20:24,010
That's another one.

2671
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:25,010
Fuck.

2672
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:25,270
Okay.

2673
02:20:27,290 --> 02:20:27,930
There we go.

2674
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:29,550
I got the strat in.

2675
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:31,270
I'm blocking him.

2676
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:33,330
I'm meat blocking him.

2677
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:33,830
No!

2678
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:34,970
You're supposed to be blocked!

2679
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:40,750
Alright.

2680
02:20:42,010 --> 02:20:42,490
Fuck!

2681
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:45,550
No, no, no.

2682
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:46,350
This is a war.

2683
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:48,930
There's no rules in war.

2684
02:20:50,670 --> 02:20:51,310
Here we go.

2685
02:20:52,050 --> 02:20:53,010
Come on, drop another one.

2686
02:20:53,370 --> 02:20:54,150
Drop another one!

2687
02:20:54,570 --> 02:20:55,390
Grab it to me!

2688
02:20:57,930 --> 02:20:59,670
Come on, I need more!

2689
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:00,930
More meat!

2690
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:04,110
That's right!

2691
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:05,190
Keep dropping them!

2692
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:07,870
Okay, now I'm just helping him go faster.

2693
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:12,530
Here we go.

2694
02:21:13,470 --> 02:21:14,250
That should be another one.

2695
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:17,150
Alright.

2696
02:21:19,070 --> 02:21:19,470
There we go.

2697
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:23,390
Oh my god, I got... I got... Wait, what?!

2698
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:25,070
He's dropping them all!

2699
02:21:27,230 --> 02:21:28,910
It's raining roadkill!

2700
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:33,530
Come on.

2701
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:35,130
Just two more.

2702
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:38,730
Alright.

2703
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:41,470
Here we go.

2704
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:42,150
One more, one more!

2705
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:44,790
Wait, where is he?

2706
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:46,890
And I was like, wait.

2707
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:48,890
Here we go.

2708
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:51,410
Oh my god, we did it.

2709
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:55,870
It's raining meat.

2710
02:21:57,910 --> 02:21:59,590
Alright, thank you for the superchat.

2711
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:00,530
Thank you, thank you.

2712
02:22:00,650 --> 02:22:02,430
Tokyo is the best tribe I've ever seen.

2713
02:22:02,910 --> 02:22:04,650
Matthew Murdock.

2714
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:06,490
Thank you for the superchat.

2715
02:22:06,630 --> 02:22:07,650
Thank you, thank you.

2716
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:09,190
Thank you.

2717
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:10,170
Come again.

2718
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:12,730
Wait.

2719
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:14,630
Money?

2720
02:22:15,730 --> 02:22:16,290
Money.

2721
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:18,710
Free money.

2722
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:20,250
Alright, stay here.

2723
02:22:21,250 --> 02:22:22,750
Oh shit, it's time!

2724
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:27,010
I keep forgetting.

2725
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:32,130
Please, Appu, I need money to buy Florida.

2726
02:22:32,990 --> 02:22:34,670
That's all I wanted.

2727
02:22:35,670 --> 02:22:38,590
It's every girl's dream to own Florida.

2728
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:41,710
No time for that.

2729
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:46,950
But it's every girl's dream.

2730
02:22:50,450 --> 02:22:53,190
I just want to own Florida.

2731
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:57,110
Oh hey, there's one of the crazy monkeys.

2732
02:22:58,330 --> 02:22:59,270
From Dr. Nick.

2733
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:01,410
Oh my god, it's him!

2734
02:23:02,470 --> 02:23:04,210
Oh my god, it's a scratchy bot!

2735
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:06,230
Why does he have a scratchy bot?

2736
02:23:11,410 --> 02:23:12,450
Yeah, where is he?

2737
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:20,410
Oh, did he got raptured?

2738
02:23:23,890 --> 02:23:24,490
Yeah!

2739
02:23:25,630 --> 02:23:27,430
It's me, the lizard queen!

2740
02:23:28,450 --> 02:23:30,270
I need to talk to someone wise.

2741
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:31,450
Let's go to get Grandpa.

2742
02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:34,610
Surely he knows what's up.

2743
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:36,950
Okay, now I'm gonna go get money.

2744
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:39,610
I need money.

2745
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:44,090
Where money can be exchanged for goods and services.

2746
02:23:46,930 --> 02:23:47,770
Wait, where's Grandpa?

2747
02:23:49,070 --> 02:23:50,070
He's right here.

2748
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:53,050
Wait a minute.

2749
02:23:53,530 --> 02:23:54,670
He's right here.

2750
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:56,810
Wait, Grandpa, what are you doing here?

2751
02:23:58,170 --> 02:24:00,790
I thought to explore to find you, Grandpa.

2752
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,280
Explain how.

2753
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:29,020
I better use something big if I wanna take that car out.

2754
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:31,420
Digi, thank you for the super chat.

2755
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,160
Thank you, thank you.

2756
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:33,220
Here, money.

2757
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:34,260
No!

2758
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:37,220
I want it in Florida!

2759
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:41,910
Florida!

2760
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:48,230
I have to buy a school bus?

2761
02:24:49,150 --> 02:24:51,670
What about Florida?

2762
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:51,990
Florida!

2763
02:24:54,510 --> 02:24:57,370
That is not fair.

2764
02:24:58,630 --> 02:25:00,450
Weepking, thank you for the super chat.

2765
02:25:00,550 --> 02:25:01,630
Thank you, thank you.

2766
02:25:02,250 --> 02:25:05,450
When did Simpsons become GTA?

2767
02:25:06,090 --> 02:25:07,630
Always has been.

2768
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:09,310
I'm sad.

2769
02:25:10,830 --> 02:25:12,610
Oh shit, oh shit.

2770
02:25:12,890 --> 02:25:14,630
Oh no, I've become a car.

2771
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:16,510
Alright, that's fine.

2772
02:25:16,590 --> 02:25:17,830
I think that car will be okay.

2773
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:23,410
No, I have to... Wait, can I go gambling?

2774
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:29,490
Wait, if I go gambling, I can double my money.

2775
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,840
Okay, never mind.

2776
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:36,720
Let's not go gambling.

2777
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:42,100
It's okay.

2778
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:45,580
Guys, it's just that easy.

2779
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:46,940
Let's quit gambling, guys.

2780
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:47,780
Just click no.

2781
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:49,640
Wait, where did he go?

2782
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:52,260
He's so far up.

2783
02:25:55,070 --> 02:25:57,750
Oh my God, it's $300?

2784
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:01,330
Oh my God.

2785
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:05,470
It's like, maybe I shouldn't have got arrested like six times.

2786
02:26:05,990 --> 02:26:09,010
Maybe I should've...

2787
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:12,390
Maybe I should've saved money.

2788
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:18,510
How was I supposed to know, guys?

2789
02:26:19,310 --> 02:26:21,770
That money would be important.

2790
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:25,490
Who would've known?

2791
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:29,530
Eating, thank you for the super chat.

2792
02:26:29,610 --> 02:26:30,310
Thank you, thank you.

2793
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:32,890
Oh no, no, no, my coins, my coins.

2794
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,440
Alright.

2795
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:40,620
Basic economics.

2796
02:26:41,620 --> 02:26:45,120
I thought it was like a collectible, you know?

2797
02:26:52,910 --> 02:26:58,230
Eat, um, here's ten dot bucks to aid in the acquisition of Florida to the Jokey Shrine.

2798
02:26:58,550 --> 02:27:00,570
Bet it all on red.

2799
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:03,110
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2800
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:06,190
Leto, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2801
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:09,950
Guys, I need a hundred more coins, guys.

2802
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:13,550
Oh my God, why did I...

2803
02:27:13,550 --> 02:27:15,610
Oh look, it's OIDAMCAPCRUSTY!

2804
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:18,050
I thought they closed that shit down.

2805
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:22,450
I'm broke, Gato.

2806
02:27:22,890 --> 02:27:26,310
Can I have a student discount, please?

2807
02:27:29,330 --> 02:27:32,490
Just a student... just a student discount.

2808
02:27:34,370 --> 02:27:36,410
Alright, I need a hundred more.

2809
02:27:38,470 --> 02:27:41,930
It's okay, as long as the car doesn't actually explode, we'll be fine.

2810
02:27:42,030 --> 02:27:42,650
Wait, where am I?

2811
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:44,850
Oh my God, the walk all the way back.

2812
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:52,800
I seem to be stranded here, can you help a sister out?

2813
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:55,360
Okay, I need to kick this guy.

2814
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,460
Nice, alright, more money.

2815
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:01,980
I don't know, I thought I'd go into, like...

2816
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:08,000
I thought I'd see, like, I don't know, a little Jimmy that got fell down the well.

2817
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:11,060
How was I supposed to know it'd take me back here?

2818
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:17,580
Alright, it's fine.

2819
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:23,560
As long as I don't get arrested, then everything should be okay.

2820
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:29,640
Surely, I'll stay out of trouble this time.

2821
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:36,640
You know, it only takes me getting arrested six times to know when to not break the law.

2822
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:38,780
Alright, nice.

2823
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:41,000
Alright, get over here.

2824
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:45,060
Okay, that should be, like, almost a hundred.

2825
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:48,320
Okay, 70, 81.

2826
02:28:48,980 --> 02:28:50,020
What the fuck?

2827
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:50,600
What is that?

2828
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:51,040
Oh, no.

2829
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:52,440
What is that?

2830
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:55,140
Oh my God, that's a dead pig.

2831
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:58,060
For only one dollar?!

2832
02:28:59,120 --> 02:28:59,720
Damn.

2833
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:02,480
Economy sucks these days.

2834
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:04,060
Yay, campfire!

2835
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:06,880
Oh, why is it glowing?

2836
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:08,700
It's cause it's like a little Easter egg.

2837
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:10,240
Every time.

2838
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:14,020
Yeah, that's right, Lord.

2839
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:15,460
I can't, guys.

2840
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:17,560
I have to buy a bus.

2841
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:23,100
I have to buy a bus, guys.

2842
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:25,940
They won't let me.

2843
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:27,120
Wait, can I run this over?

2844
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:29,900
Oh, no.

2845
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:31,620
Guys, I can't let this car explode.

2846
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:34,940
I'm gonna abandon this car now, so it'll never explode.

2847
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:40,220
Okay, there is, like, a little opening here.

2848
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:43,300
Alright, that should be, like...

2849
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:46,160
It should have, like, another ten dollars here.

2850
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:49,380
Welp, I'm too short.

2851
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:54,220
No, why must I have a body of a child?!

2852
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:58,140
Let me kick you!

2853
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:00,580
Okay, that should be a hundred.

2854
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:05,860
I need to save up 200 more for Florida.

2855
02:30:07,060 --> 02:30:08,240
Where does this take me?

2856
02:30:08,820 --> 02:30:09,760
Where am I?

2857
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:10,560
Nice!

2858
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:14,920
Nice!

2859
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:15,880
Oh, my God.

2860
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,620
Oh, my God, my dream is gonna come true!

2861
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:20,980
Never give up, guys.

2862
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:24,440
Never give up, and then you can buy the state of Florida.

2863
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:26,460
Never give up!

2864
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:28,400
Don't let your dreams become dreams!

2865
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:31,240
Alright.

2866
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:37,300
All I have to do is just...

2867
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:37,840
Oh, shit.

2868
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:38,460
Oh, shit.

2869
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:43,060
It's okay, I got 30 dollars from that.

2870
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:48,360
Alright, got the school bus.

2871
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:53,000
Okay, I just need 200 dollars.

2872
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:57,560
Alright, let's see.

2873
02:30:58,320 --> 02:30:58,840
Hello?

2874
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:02,060
I need that school bus.

2875
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:06,920
Alright, don't worry.

2876
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:13,440
My IQ is 120, so I'm legally allowed to drive a school bus.

2877
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:19,780
Alright.

2878
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:24,540
Alright, nice.

2879
02:31:26,480 --> 02:31:29,580
I feel like IQ tests are a scam, though, to be fair.

2880
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:44,180
Oh, wait.

2881
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:44,960
I already... Okay.

2882
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:47,300
Destroy the black sedan to find a clue.

2883
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:49,060
Don't let time run out.

2884
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:51,280
Alright, I got the bus, though.

2885
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:56,920
Alright.

2886
02:31:59,220 --> 02:32:00,280
Wait, what's this?

2887
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:02,180
Oh, collect Bart's lucky hat?

2888
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,260
Oh, now to destroy it.

2889
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:04,820
Oh, fuck.

2890
02:32:05,140 --> 02:32:05,560
Please!

2891
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:08,500
I spent my Florida money for this!

2892
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,140
Let me destroy you!

2893
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:13,640
That's all I asked for!

2894
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:15,460
I only want one simple thing.

2895
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:19,320
Crashing your car into this dam.

2896
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:21,060
That's all I wanted.

2897
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:22,880
Just one thing.

2898
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:24,040
One tiny thing.

2899
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,660
Can you not do that for me?

2900
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:28,320
I don't ask for much.

2901
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:29,840
Nice.

2902
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:30,800
Yay, crime!

2903
02:32:31,820 --> 02:32:32,980
Yay, he's dead.

2904
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:40,240
Alright, there must be... Oh, I might be able to get money here.

2905
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:41,640
Okay.

2906
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:44,720
Okay.

2907
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:47,140
Every time!

2908
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:50,080
Every time, just like, but money!

2909
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,580
Get back in your car, Doki!

2910
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:54,380
This is hit and run!

2911
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:58,860
Alright, okay.

2912
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:01,560
Okay, game.

2913
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:05,260
I guess I'll get back in the car.

2914
02:33:10,510 --> 02:33:11,390
Alright.

2915
02:33:11,390 --> 02:33:13,310
Alright, here I go.

2916
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:15,830
I have to go downstairs.

2917
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:17,690
Downtown.

2918
02:33:21,090 --> 02:33:23,130
I'm at the Aztec Theater.

2919
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:24,310
Oh wait, another one?

2920
02:33:25,450 --> 02:33:26,430
Where's he going?

2921
02:33:29,230 --> 02:33:29,970
No.

2922
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:31,070
What?

2923
02:33:33,250 --> 02:33:36,850
Okay, I was not expecting that.

2924
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:38,610
Wait, that's not fair!

2925
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:41,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2926
02:33:43,090 --> 02:33:44,270
Can't get me!

2927
02:33:46,070 --> 02:33:47,150
That's right!

2928
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:49,690
Wait, there's a cop over there.

2929
02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:52,910
Wait a minute.

2930
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:54,170
Wait a minute.

2931
02:33:54,590 --> 02:33:55,370
Wait a minute.

2932
02:33:55,450 --> 02:33:56,130
No, no, no, no, no.

2933
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:57,030
I can't.

2934
02:33:57,330 --> 02:33:57,730
Please.

2935
02:33:58,050 --> 02:33:59,810
Please, I saved so much money.

2936
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:00,830
Please!

2937
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:03,030
It can't do this to me!

2938
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:06,270
I saved so much!

2939
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:08,850
This car is so beefy!

2940
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:13,650
It's so hard to drive this car!

2941
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:17,050
No, no, no.

2942
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:18,230
Please, please, please.

2943
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:19,310
I don't care.

2944
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:20,610
I don't care!

2945
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:22,170
Oh my god, okay.

2946
02:34:22,990 --> 02:34:23,370
It's fine.

2947
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:26,190
I just gotta slam the car once.

2948
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:29,590
And then he should be out of it.

2949
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:33,530
Okay, where is he though?

2950
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:37,390
It's okay.

2951
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:40,510
As long as I slam this car once, it should be fine.

2952
02:34:43,430 --> 02:34:44,730
Wherever this car is.

2953
02:34:44,790 --> 02:34:46,150
Okay, I just need to find him.

2954
02:34:49,730 --> 02:34:51,850
Okay, apparently it's not just once, guys.

2955
02:34:52,710 --> 02:34:55,170
Apparently it's not just once.

2956
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:57,170
It's alright.

2957
02:34:57,710 --> 02:34:58,250
It's okay.

2958
02:34:58,350 --> 02:34:59,290
I can do this again.

2959
02:35:01,830 --> 02:35:03,290
I can do this again.

2960
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:05,690
That's fine.

2961
02:35:05,890 --> 02:35:08,070
I just gotta push him up the ramp.

2962
02:35:09,350 --> 02:35:11,390
Push him up against another car.

2963
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:13,510
That's right.

2964
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:17,030
I can do this forever.

2965
02:35:17,850 --> 02:35:19,790
I just need another car to hit you.

2966
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:26,000
Alright, here we go.

2967
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:29,160
Get over here!

2968
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:31,540
Boom!

2969
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:32,620
Alright, nice.

2970
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:35,600
Alright, that's fine, Lisa.

2971
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:37,380
You're never going to college anyway.

2972
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:41,560
You're never gonna age up for college.

2973
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:45,520
If anything, you just get a scholarship money.

2974
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:46,740
That's okay.

2975
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:51,160
It's alright, guys.

2976
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:52,580
I'm pretty sure he has life insurance.

2977
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:53,680
It'll be fine.

2978
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:57,020
Alright, nice.

2979
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:58,080
Stop resisting!

2980
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:03,920
Stop resisting!

2981
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:09,060
Alright, here we go.

2982
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:11,620
Where do I go from here?

2983
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:11,900
Here?

2984
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:12,820
Yeah.

2985
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:17,900
I already forgot where the other cars are.

2986
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:27,350
Alright, there should be another car coming up here now.

2987
02:36:28,170 --> 02:36:29,350
Wait, where's the other car?

2988
02:36:30,270 --> 02:36:31,350
Where is it?

2989
02:36:33,890 --> 02:36:35,070
Oh, there it is.

2990
02:36:36,410 --> 02:36:37,030
Okay, no.

2991
02:36:37,290 --> 02:36:37,990
JK, I lied.

2992
02:36:38,250 --> 02:36:38,910
There it is!

2993
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:39,430
There he is.

2994
02:36:39,470 --> 02:36:39,810
Don't worry.

2995
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:40,970
I'll hit him.

2996
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,590
Boom!

2997
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:45,570
See, it's that easy.

2998
02:36:47,930 --> 02:36:48,830
Get over here!

2999
02:36:49,330 --> 02:36:51,390
You think you can get away from me?!

3000
02:36:52,450 --> 02:36:53,970
I outdrove the cops!

3001
02:36:56,690 --> 02:36:57,650
Get over here!

3002
02:36:58,430 --> 02:36:59,670
Oh my god, he's like 1 HP.

3003
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:03,890
Alright, I still have like... nice.

3004
02:37:05,330 --> 02:37:07,870
I have drive the planet hype.

3005
02:37:08,010 --> 02:37:08,890
Okay, one more.

3006
02:37:14,530 --> 02:37:16,890
Alright, one more car.

3007
02:37:17,210 --> 02:37:17,850
Get over here.

3008
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:19,050
Get your ass over here!

3009
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:21,390
Oh no.

3010
02:37:21,690 --> 02:37:22,410
Oh no.

3011
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:24,030
I only have a little bit more.

3012
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:26,470
I can only run over one more person.

3013
02:37:28,330 --> 02:37:30,150
I gotta pick that wisely.

3014
02:37:34,830 --> 02:37:36,730
Alright, I got my one.

3015
02:37:37,530 --> 02:37:39,450
I got my one.

3016
02:37:41,170 --> 02:37:42,290
It's okay, guys.

3017
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:43,230
I got my one.

3018
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:47,850
I can run over one more.

3019
02:37:48,110 --> 02:37:50,730
Alright, and then I'll never commit crime again.

3020
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:52,370
Oh shit.

3021
02:37:52,570 --> 02:37:53,210
Oh shit.

3022
02:37:53,470 --> 02:37:54,050
Oh shit.

3023
02:37:54,310 --> 02:37:54,670
Please!

3024
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:55,190
Please!

3025
02:37:55,730 --> 02:37:56,230
Please!

3026
02:37:56,330 --> 02:37:57,490
I can't go back!

3027
02:37:57,530 --> 02:37:58,550
I was so close!

3028
02:37:59,450 --> 02:37:59,870
Please!

3029
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:01,410
You can't put me back in there!

3030
02:38:05,210 --> 02:38:05,810
Please!

3031
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:09,550
I can't go back to jail!

3032
02:38:10,290 --> 02:38:10,570
No!

3033
02:38:11,390 --> 02:38:12,290
I can't get...

3034
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:12,770
No!

3035
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:21,490
I can't!

3036
02:38:22,570 --> 02:38:27,110
No, he's gonna... and I'm gonna lose suspicion too!

3037
02:38:28,930 --> 02:38:29,530
No.

3038
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:30,270
No.

3039
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:31,710
He's just one hit.

3040
02:38:31,710 --> 02:38:32,590
He's just one hit!

3041
02:38:34,890 --> 02:38:36,890
Oh my god!

3042
02:38:37,730 --> 02:38:40,030
It was one hit!

3043
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:43,910
It was actually one hit!

3044
02:38:45,370 --> 02:38:47,250
Oh my god!

3045
02:38:49,650 --> 02:38:52,230
I just... I was so close!

3046
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:55,850
It was actually one hit!

3047
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:58,870
What's the point?

3048
02:38:59,230 --> 02:39:02,610
We lost $50 for nothing.

3049
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:05,270
What's the... Oh my god!

3050
02:39:05,330 --> 02:39:06,870
And then he kills himself!

3051
02:39:07,450 --> 02:39:09,790
Why couldn't the other card do that?

3052
02:39:12,490 --> 02:39:15,650
He had nothing to live for!

3053
02:39:17,150 --> 02:39:19,890
Why couldn't he do that?

3054
02:39:21,250 --> 02:39:23,510
Fight the intrusive.

3055
02:39:23,790 --> 02:39:25,950
He didn't even give me the kill!

3056
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:28,910
I'm so sad!

3057
02:39:34,930 --> 02:39:37,210
Oh my... What's the point?

3058
02:39:38,330 --> 02:39:39,670
What's the point?

3059
02:39:39,730 --> 02:39:40,830
I'm using the stairs.

3060
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:43,410
Fuck this.

3061
02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:44,690
I'm using the stairs.

3062
02:39:45,450 --> 02:39:48,210
I don't need regular roads.

3063
02:39:49,850 --> 02:39:51,310
What's the point?

3064
02:39:52,110 --> 02:39:54,070
All my money.

3065
02:39:54,470 --> 02:40:01,370
God, there's no point in working hard when you're just gonna get arrested anyway!

3066
02:40:05,050 --> 02:40:17,470
What's the point of working hard when the fucking police are gonna frame you for murder and arrest you unjustly?

3067
02:40:19,990 --> 02:40:22,070
I didn't do nothing!

3068
02:40:23,290 --> 02:40:25,650
I was driving the car!

3069
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:28,650
Just cause I drive the car?

3070
02:40:29,410 --> 02:40:30,650
Just cause I'm a woman?

3071
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:34,430
A little girl driving a school bus?

3072
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:36,570
I deserve to get arrested?

3073
02:40:38,650 --> 02:40:40,250
I should've gone off the grid.

3074
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:45,350
Why is there so many people there?

3075
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:47,990
How can I legally destroy a car with all these civilians?

3076
02:40:53,490 --> 02:40:54,730
What's the point?

3077
02:40:55,210 --> 02:40:59,350
How can I legally commit manslaughter with all these people in the way?

3078
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:07,830
Can't even manslaughter in peace!

3079
02:41:09,670 --> 02:41:12,710
Florida's forever out of reach.

3080
02:41:15,170 --> 02:41:16,850
Road rage.

3081
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:23,750
DIE!

3082
02:41:24,930 --> 02:41:26,470
Your life doesn't matter!

3083
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:28,390
Take your life out yourself!

3084
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:32,310
Alright, come on!

3085
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:33,570
Crash into me!

3086
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:35,390
Crash into me!

3087
02:41:35,430 --> 02:41:36,590
Oh my god!

3088
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:38,450
You're literally one!

3089
02:41:38,930 --> 02:41:41,430
Who are you living for and what do you have to live for?

3090
02:41:41,650 --> 02:41:42,950
You're one inch big!

3091
02:41:43,090 --> 02:41:44,210
I swear to god!

3092
02:41:44,690 --> 02:41:48,850
Oh my god, I swear to god, I've touched him like 20 times!

3093
02:41:49,630 --> 02:41:56,350
I swear to fucking god, I've touched this car 20- I swear to god, I sw- no, no!

3094
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:57,490
I swear to god!

3095
02:41:58,230 --> 02:41:59,670
No way!

3096
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:06,910
No fucking way!

3097
02:42:07,930 --> 02:42:09,930
Oh my god!

3098
02:42:11,630 --> 02:42:15,330
He actually got away with one inch speed!

3099
02:42:16,110 --> 02:42:17,030
What the fuck?

3100
02:42:17,310 --> 02:42:18,590
I like hit him!

3101
02:42:18,910 --> 02:42:23,870
He hit so- guys, you don't unders- Oh my- I can't, I have to retry this.

3102
02:42:24,350 --> 02:42:26,010
I- I can't.

3103
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:28,330
I can't catch up to him.

3104
02:42:28,330 --> 02:42:31,570
Oh my god, I don't understand!

3105
02:42:33,690 --> 02:42:36,450
How- how did that car survive?

3106
02:42:41,070 --> 02:42:42,830
Oh my god.

3107
02:42:43,690 --> 02:42:44,530
It's okay.

3108
02:42:46,790 --> 02:42:47,130
Alright.

3109
02:42:48,930 --> 02:43:06,810
I swear to god, if I see this car fucking explode without me, I swear to fucking god, if this car suddenly explodes without me doing anything else, I swear to fucking god, I swear, I swear, I swear to god, I swear to god, you better not explode without me touching you.

3110
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:08,750
I- I'm watching you.

3111
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:12,970
I'm fucking watching you right now, there we go.

3112
02:43:13,230 --> 02:43:16,030
That car's too angry to die.

3113
02:43:16,710 --> 02:43:21,130
I swear to fucking god, if this car does not explode- Oh!

3114
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:21,290
Oh!

3115
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:26,590
Hang on by a goddamn thread.

3116
02:43:27,890 --> 02:43:29,450
Alright, another car.

3117
02:43:31,430 --> 02:43:32,430
Another car.

3118
02:43:32,930 --> 02:43:34,090
I'm going straight in.

3119
02:43:34,970 --> 02:43:35,850
There we go.

3120
02:43:36,910 --> 02:43:37,510
There we go.

3121
02:43:38,330 --> 02:43:40,310
That's right, oh and then he crashes himself.

3122
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:43,190
Why can't- why couldn't other cars be just like you?

3123
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:44,430
You're different.

3124
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:45,930
Where is he going?

3125
02:43:47,110 --> 02:43:48,730
Where is he going?

3126
02:43:49,430 --> 02:43:50,750
Where is he going?

3127
02:43:51,290 --> 02:43:52,550
Where are you going?

3128
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:54,230
Oh my god.

3129
02:43:56,670 --> 02:43:58,450
Yeah, you're not going anywhere, buddy.

3130
02:43:59,090 --> 02:44:00,470
You're not going anywhere.

3131
02:44:00,650 --> 02:44:03,490
There we go, I get two cars for the price of one?

3132
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:04,510
Let's fucking go.

3133
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:08,350
Nice guys, I got a twofer.

3134
02:44:11,470 --> 02:44:11,990
Alright.

3135
02:44:17,550 --> 02:44:18,390
Alright.

3136
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:20,650
I see you.

3137
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:23,830
That's fucking right.

3138
02:44:25,330 --> 02:44:26,510
I see you.

3139
02:44:26,810 --> 02:44:28,630
You can't get out of this corner!

3140
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:31,910
You can't get out of this corner!

3141
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:36,130
That's fucking right!

3142
02:44:38,150 --> 02:44:39,670
In a chain corner!

3143
02:44:41,990 --> 02:44:42,210
That's right!

3144
02:44:42,370 --> 02:44:44,010
You'll never leave!

3145
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:45,430
I did it.

3146
02:44:49,130 --> 02:44:50,510
We did it.

3147
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:52,170
We did it.

3148
02:44:52,890 --> 02:44:53,630
You know what?

3149
02:44:53,870 --> 02:44:54,950
I deserve a reward.

3150
02:44:58,820 --> 02:44:59,900
There we go.

3151
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:02,160
I deserve a reward for that.

3152
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:04,700
With some legal manslaughter.

3153
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:08,740
Alright.

3154
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:10,220
Nice.

3155
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:10,340
Nice.

3156
02:45:12,300 --> 02:45:13,320
That's right, Chief Wiggum.

3157
02:45:13,380 --> 02:45:14,420
What are you going to do about it, huh?

3158
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:16,520
That's fucking right.

3159
02:45:17,220 --> 02:45:17,680
Nothing!

3160
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,000
Nothing!

3161
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:29,060
Yeah.

3162
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:42,460
Yeah?

3163
02:45:43,300 --> 02:45:44,300
What kind of disguise?

3164
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:50,020
Wait,

3165
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:55,480
what kind of costume?

3166
02:45:56,360 --> 02:45:57,440
You need a disguise purchase?

3167
02:45:57,640 --> 02:45:57,960
No!

3168
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:02,100
But...

3169
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:05,300
But I saved all that money!

3170
02:46:07,140 --> 02:46:08,060
But...

3171
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:11,980
But I saved all that money!

3172
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,040
Not fair!

3173
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:22,060
Like, it's not fair!

3174
02:46:23,420 --> 02:46:25,520
Why can't I just buy a state?

3175
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:30,100
Not fair!

3176
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:32,200
A state is meant to be bought.

3177
02:46:32,320 --> 02:46:33,220
Look at Alaska.

3178
02:46:33,220 --> 02:46:33,500
Look at Alaska.

3179
02:46:37,280 --> 02:46:40,240
Florida remains under the sea.

3180
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:45,620
Can't believe it.

3181
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,860
I wanted to hold...

3182
02:46:50,860 --> 02:46:53,300
You're never too young for coffee, Lisa.

3183
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,440
Apparently.

3184
02:46:57,480 --> 02:46:59,400
I'm so sad.

3185
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:00,440
I'm so sad.

3186
02:47:00,460 --> 02:47:03,800
I feel like you should be able to legally rob somebody.

3187
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:04,920
For money.

3188
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:05,920
If this is...

3189
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:08,860
This is why this is GTA for kids.

3190
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:10,400
They won't let me rob anyone.

3191
02:47:14,860 --> 02:47:15,360
Alright.

3192
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,360
Where can I get money?

3193
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,020
Why can't I rob these people?

3194
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,820
What did I get?

3195
02:47:27,820 --> 02:47:29,240
Oh, I got like...

3196
02:47:29,240 --> 02:47:30,520
Guys, I don't want to do racing.

3197
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:33,020
Unless it's a mission.

3198
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:35,720
Racing is so hard.

3199
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:40,940
Give me money!

3200
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:45,740
Why can't I steal their money?

3201
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:47,960
What are they gonna do with it?

3202
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:49,300
They're not gonna buy Florida?

3203
02:47:52,820 --> 02:47:53,780
Oh, there's money.

3204
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:54,660
There's money.

3205
02:47:55,460 --> 02:47:56,900
Wait, there's money here.

3206
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:01,280
How do I get this, though?

3207
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:03,740
Oh my god, my $4.

3208
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:05,220
Let's go.

3209
02:48:08,040 --> 02:48:11,960
The final level to this game was brutally difficult?

3210
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:12,880
Wait, what do you mean?

3211
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:13,620
What?

3212
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:16,540
What do you mean?

3213
02:48:17,220 --> 02:48:18,360
I'm already struggling.

3214
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:21,780
Wait, how many...

3215
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:23,180
How many levels are there left?

3216
02:48:24,360 --> 02:48:25,220
Hey, there's Skinner.

3217
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:30,480
Wait, what do you mean?

3218
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:40,380
What do you mean?

3219
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:45,880
Oh,

3220
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:53,560
okay.

3221
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:55,060
I mean, might as well, right?

3222
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:58,860
Help Principal Skinner complete his errands before...

3223
02:48:58,860 --> 02:48:59,380
You know what?

3224
02:48:59,500 --> 02:49:00,880
He's already missing, guys.

3225
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:02,860
He can't be missing for...

3226
02:49:03,660 --> 02:49:04,620
I mean, like...

3227
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:06,860
He's already missing, so, like...

3228
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:08,560
So, like...

3229
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:10,120
It's okay if we, like, you know...

3230
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:11,380
Do some errands or so.

3231
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:15,340
He can't go more missing.

3232
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:18,460
What's gonna happen?

3233
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:19,260
Amber Alert?

3234
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:22,800
If anything...

3235
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:24,500
Him being missing longer...

3236
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:25,580
Is better for us.

3237
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:27,560
So then there's an Amber Alert.

3238
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:29,800
So then, we can have, like...

3239
02:49:29,800 --> 02:49:30,820
Free search parties.

3240
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:37,620
Ooh, gold stars.

3241
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:40,500
Will that go on my report card?

3242
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,520
Isn't that not how it works?

3243
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:47,360
If your child is missing for more than...

3244
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:49,920
X amount of days, an Amber Alert will go off.

3245
02:49:51,960 --> 02:49:53,160
Yeah, but then...

3246
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:55,940
Who's gonna murder Bart?

3247
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:57,780
Sideshow Bob?

3248
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:59,020
He's in prison.

3249
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:01,320
And I trust...

3250
02:50:01,320 --> 02:50:04,080
I trust Springfield's jail system.

3251
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:05,660
Run by our...

3252
02:50:05,660 --> 02:50:08,080
Our beloved chief, Wiggum.

3253
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:11,100
Alright.

3254
02:50:13,780 --> 02:50:14,660
Hello.

3255
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:24,100
Ha!

3256
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:26,600
Yay!

3257
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:27,760
MSG!

3258
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:36,260
Wait,

3259
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,320
what war would Skinner be in now?

3260
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:44,680
Now that it's 2025?

3261
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:47,000
Cause, like...

3262
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,940
Abraham... I won't say Abraham Lincoln.

3263
02:50:49,240 --> 02:50:50,080
Abraham Simpson.

3264
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:52,340
Abe is in, like, the Vietnam War.

3265
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:54,500
So, like, what war would he be in?

3266
02:50:54,940 --> 02:50:56,840
Oh, he'd be, like, in...

3267
02:50:56,840 --> 02:50:58,600
Yeah, I'm like...

3268
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:00,410
Yeah, cause they have to, like...

3269
02:51:01,380 --> 02:51:02,780
They have to fix the...

3270
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:04,480
The timeline of everything.

3271
02:51:05,740 --> 02:51:06,700
Oh, true.

3272
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:08,400
Oh my god.

3273
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:09,720
We're in...

3274
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:12,620
We're, like, at a time now that, like...

3275
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:15,240
Skinner participated in the Middle Eastern Wars.

3276
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:16,640
Like, that's actually...

3277
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:19,300
Absolutely crazy to think about.

3278
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:21,900
The Simpsons had aired so long...

3279
02:51:21,900 --> 02:51:24,560
That, like, Principal Skinner's participant was...

3280
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:26,620
Was in another different kind of war.

3281
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:34,020
No, they fixed him.

3282
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:35,240
Because, like...

3283
02:51:35,240 --> 02:51:36,940
The timeline is different now.

3284
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:38,140
Because it's all, like...

3285
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:40,680
They're always, like, changing the timeline.

3286
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:43,080
That they always, like, stay relevant.

3287
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:44,880
They made the new...

3288
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:47,320
The new timeline of the Simpsons.

3289
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:49,100
That Abe was in the Vietnam War.

3290
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:50,900
He's not in World War I and II anymore.

3291
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:52,860
He's in the Vietnam War.

3292
02:51:53,860 --> 02:51:55,340
Are you watching the newest episodes?

3293
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:03,300
Alright, time for...

3294
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:04,200
What do I have to do here?

3295
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:06,540
Where am I going?

3296
02:52:07,540 --> 02:52:09,920
She's talking about modern Simpsons!

3297
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:11,740
We don't talk about...

3298
02:52:11,740 --> 02:52:12,100
Hahaha!

3299
02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:14,480
They don't exist here!

3300
02:52:15,220 --> 02:52:17,200
You know there's an episode where...

3301
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:18,800
Bart Simpsons becomes a pro gamer...

3302
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:19,900
And he plays League of Legends?

3303
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:21,420
Hahaha!

3304
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:23,680
But, like, the Simpsons League of Legends.

3305
02:52:23,820 --> 02:52:25,320
Oh, shit, I'm gonna fail this one.

3306
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:25,860
No!

3307
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:27,220
Hahaha!

3308
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:31,000
No!

3309
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:32,480
It's too busy!

3310
02:52:33,740 --> 02:52:36,000
Yeah, there's an episode in the Simpsons...

3311
02:52:36,680 --> 02:52:38,380
Where, like, Bart Simpsons...

3312
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:40,100
Becomes, like, an eSports gamer.

3313
02:52:40,980 --> 02:52:41,940
And he plays, like...

3314
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,840
He plays, like, League.

3315
02:52:44,060 --> 02:52:44,540
Hahaha!

3316
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,780
Alright, don't worry, I'm heading home.

3317
02:52:52,020 --> 02:52:53,480
I'm heading to Darren's.

3318
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:56,020
I was too busy yapping.

3319
02:53:01,430 --> 02:53:01,690
Alright.

3320
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:05,030
I need to figure out the shortcuts for this area.

3321
02:53:07,550 --> 02:53:08,990
Oh my god.

3322
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:12,970
The time mission is so brutal.

3323
02:53:13,950 --> 02:53:16,630
I won't be surprised if there's an episode...

3324
02:53:16,630 --> 02:53:18,010
Where Lisa becomes a VTuber.

3325
02:53:18,490 --> 02:53:20,150
I will not be surprised.

3326
02:53:20,150 --> 02:53:21,690
Because they always do, like...

3327
02:53:21,690 --> 02:53:24,350
They always do, like, modern takes of things now.

3328
02:53:24,570 --> 02:53:25,150
For episodes.

3329
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:30,000
Let's see.

3330
02:53:33,380 --> 02:53:34,100
That's fine.

3331
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:40,320
Stop inventing!

3332
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:44,140
Alright, give me the meat.

3333
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:45,860
Actually, the MSG.

3334
02:53:52,420 --> 02:53:52,760
Alright.

3335
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:54,440
I have no idea where, like...

3336
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:55,700
This last one is.

3337
02:53:58,860 --> 02:54:00,440
Where's the last mission?

3338
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:05,320
Oh.

3339
02:54:09,670 --> 02:54:10,310
Alright.

3340
02:54:12,370 --> 02:54:13,810
Oh, I can go down here.

3341
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:15,110
Yay!

3342
02:54:16,070 --> 02:54:16,810
Oh, fuck!

3343
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:20,230
I keep forgetting that blocks me.

3344
02:54:21,490 --> 02:54:22,130
Alright, nice.

3345
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:22,970
It was just a casino.

3346
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:27,590
Alright.

3347
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:31,030
Hello, Dr. Nick.

3348
02:54:38,320 --> 02:54:39,190
That's me!

3349
02:54:41,670 --> 02:54:42,250
Oh.

3350
02:54:43,770 --> 02:54:45,610
Alright, here's your last thing.

3351
02:54:50,190 --> 02:54:51,610
Alright, drive...Wait, what?

3352
02:54:51,650 --> 02:54:53,870
I thought you said the next stop was the last stop!

3353
02:54:53,870 --> 02:54:55,110
What the fuck?

3354
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:56,610
You lied to a little girl?

3355
02:54:58,450 --> 02:54:59,870
That's messed up, yo.

3356
02:55:01,610 --> 02:55:04,110
I don't know the shortcuts here!

3357
02:55:04,390 --> 02:55:05,830
I don't have my GPS!

3358
02:55:08,530 --> 02:55:09,130
Please!

3359
02:55:11,610 --> 02:55:13,350
I don't know what's short!

3360
02:55:16,230 --> 02:55:17,150
Oh, no.

3361
02:55:17,950 --> 02:55:18,790
Oh, no.

3362
02:55:19,450 --> 02:55:20,290
No, please.

3363
02:55:20,450 --> 02:55:21,790
I'm almost there, please!

3364
02:55:21,790 --> 02:55:21,870
Please!

3365
02:55:22,550 --> 02:55:23,490
No!

3366
02:55:28,810 --> 02:55:32,190
It was right there!

3367
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:35,310
No!

3368
02:55:37,370 --> 02:55:38,130
Why?

3369
02:55:41,290 --> 02:55:43,150
How do I make it?

3370
02:55:44,970 --> 02:55:46,210
Oh, my God.

3371
02:55:46,290 --> 02:55:48,150
I literally needed one second.

3372
02:55:49,090 --> 02:55:51,970
I needed one fucking second.

3373
02:55:51,970 --> 02:55:54,030
It's not fair!

3374
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:56,290
Wait, where am I?

3375
02:55:56,390 --> 02:55:56,990
Oh, fuck.

3376
02:55:57,050 --> 02:55:57,930
I fucked it up.

3377
02:55:58,710 --> 02:56:02,030
I already fucked it up.

3378
02:56:02,090 --> 02:56:03,350
I forgot where I was.

3379
02:56:06,230 --> 02:56:07,370
Oh, my God.

3380
02:56:07,570 --> 02:56:09,050
Oh, my God.

3381
02:56:09,090 --> 02:56:09,830
I'm stuck!

3382
02:56:11,270 --> 02:56:12,230
It's over.

3383
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:14,030
It's so over.

3384
02:56:17,730 --> 02:56:19,650
Driving uphill is the worst.

3385
02:56:23,390 --> 02:56:23,950
No!

3386
02:56:24,370 --> 02:56:25,850
Not the liberal guilt!

3387
02:56:28,410 --> 02:56:28,970
Okay.

3388
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:30,990
I'm driving up the stairs.

3389
02:56:33,930 --> 02:56:34,490
Alright.

3390
02:56:35,490 --> 02:56:35,810
Here we go.

3391
02:56:37,170 --> 02:56:37,730
Recycle!

3392
02:56:37,990 --> 02:56:39,530
Thank you for the five gifted ships!

3393
02:56:39,670 --> 02:56:40,570
Thank you, thank you!

3394
02:56:42,530 --> 02:56:43,090
Alright.

3395
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:44,670
Here I go.

3396
02:56:51,310 --> 02:56:54,670
You literally said the last mission was the last mission.

3397
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:56,010
You fucking liar!

3398
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:59,130
How could you lie to a little girl?

3399
02:57:02,210 --> 02:57:03,230
Oh, my God.

3400
02:57:03,530 --> 02:57:03,670
Please.

3401
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:04,910
Please.

3402
02:57:07,410 --> 02:57:09,650
There has to be a short shortcut.

3403
02:57:10,170 --> 02:57:11,750
There has to be a short...

3404
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:12,290
Oh, no.

3405
02:57:12,490 --> 02:57:12,970
I...

3406
02:57:12,970 --> 02:57:13,490
It's fine.

3407
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:15,250
It's fine.

3408
02:57:16,110 --> 02:57:17,050
We made it.

3409
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:17,710
We made it.

3410
02:57:19,590 --> 02:57:19,930
Okay.

3411
02:57:20,370 --> 02:57:22,510
Okay, if I parked it in a good way... Okay.

3412
02:57:23,310 --> 02:57:24,410
I'll park it.

3413
02:57:25,770 --> 02:57:26,750
This is the strat.

3414
02:57:27,570 --> 02:57:28,570
This is the strat.

3415
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:31,510
I get more time.

3416
02:57:32,450 --> 02:57:32,790
Wait!

3417
02:57:34,090 --> 02:57:35,710
I got an idea.

3418
02:57:36,570 --> 02:57:40,210
The timer doesn't start until I'm in the car.

3419
02:57:40,410 --> 02:57:42,550
Until I'm in the car, right?

3420
02:57:42,550 --> 02:57:42,990
Wait!

3421
02:57:44,350 --> 02:57:45,550
The timer...

3422
02:57:46,350 --> 02:57:46,950
Wait!

3423
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:48,010
Oh, my God.

3424
02:57:48,070 --> 02:57:50,550
The timer doesn't start until I'm in the car.

3425
02:57:51,010 --> 02:57:52,350
Okay, I figured it out.

3426
02:57:52,450 --> 02:57:53,430
I figured it out.

3427
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:55,070
Okay, here.

3428
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:56,830
You stay here.

3429
02:57:57,210 --> 02:57:58,650
You stay here, Skinner.

3430
02:57:58,990 --> 02:58:00,210
You stay here.

3431
02:58:03,170 --> 02:58:04,690
I'll run back.

3432
02:58:04,690 --> 02:58:05,710
I'll...

3433
02:58:05,710 --> 02:58:12,090
I have the strat.

3434
02:58:12,470 --> 02:58:13,790
Don't worry.

3435
02:58:14,070 --> 02:58:15,450
I have the strat.

3436
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:18,090
The big brain strat.

3437
02:58:21,150 --> 02:58:24,070
Timer doesn't start until I'm in the car.

3438
02:58:24,730 --> 02:58:27,010
So that means...

3439
02:58:27,010 --> 02:58:30,550
That means I have all the time in the world.

3440
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:33,710
Get into your vehicle.

3441
02:58:33,970 --> 02:58:34,810
Don't worry.

3442
02:58:35,270 --> 02:58:36,810
I'm heading home.

3443
02:58:42,190 --> 02:58:44,490
I figured it out.

3444
02:58:45,410 --> 02:58:46,570
That's okay, right?

3445
02:58:46,890 --> 02:58:48,430
You don't outsmart me.

3446
02:58:49,610 --> 02:58:51,250
That's right, video game.

3447
02:58:51,410 --> 02:58:53,550
I make the rules.

3448
02:58:58,150 --> 02:58:59,910
Big brain moment.

3449
02:58:59,910 --> 02:59:03,130
Surely I have enough time now.

3450
02:59:03,430 --> 02:59:05,070
There's no way.

3451
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:08,190
Surely I'll make it now.

3452
02:59:12,210 --> 02:59:12,970
Okay.

3453
02:59:14,030 --> 02:59:15,430
I figured it out.

3454
02:59:15,610 --> 02:59:16,510
Oh no, please.

3455
02:59:16,870 --> 02:59:17,110
Please.

3456
02:59:17,470 --> 02:59:19,250
I need all the time I need.

3457
02:59:19,910 --> 02:59:23,110
I finally used my other brain cells.

3458
02:59:24,030 --> 02:59:25,510
Oh my god.

3459
02:59:25,790 --> 02:59:27,970
I made it.

3460
02:59:27,970 --> 02:59:30,550
You're actually so big brain.

3461
02:59:31,950 --> 02:59:32,770
Thank you for the super chat.

3462
02:59:32,970 --> 02:59:33,190
Thank you.

3463
02:59:33,570 --> 02:59:33,910
Thank you.

3464
02:59:44,770 --> 02:59:45,610
Money?

3465
02:59:47,590 --> 02:59:48,310
What?

3466
02:59:51,430 --> 02:59:51,890
Yay!

3467
02:59:52,530 --> 02:59:54,250
I got Skinner's car!

3468
02:59:55,470 --> 02:59:56,070
Nice.

3469
02:59:57,110 --> 02:59:58,890
I drive Mr. Brun's casino.

3470
02:59:59,330 --> 03:00:00,370
Wait, I need money.

3471
03:00:01,430 --> 03:00:02,690
Oh my god.

3472
03:00:03,370 --> 03:00:05,030
Why couldn't you give me money?

3473
03:00:06,530 --> 03:00:07,670
See guys?

3474
03:00:07,970 --> 03:00:10,030
He said living body.

3475
03:00:10,690 --> 03:00:12,010
I didn't fuck up.

3476
03:00:14,730 --> 03:00:17,070
Alright, there has to be money up here, right?

3477
03:00:18,890 --> 03:00:20,050
Yeah, I knew it.

3478
03:00:20,330 --> 03:00:20,950
I knew it.

3479
03:00:22,030 --> 03:00:23,690
I knew there would be money up here.

3480
03:00:25,030 --> 03:00:25,930
I need like, what?

3481
03:00:26,050 --> 03:00:26,470
200?

3482
03:00:26,530 --> 03:00:27,930
Was it 200 or 250?

3483
03:00:28,590 --> 03:00:31,410
For the cool outfit.

3484
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:37,020
50 gifted shits!

3485
03:00:37,140 --> 03:00:37,520
Thank you!

3486
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:38,340
Thank you!

3487
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:40,200
I really appreciate it.

3488
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:41,860
Thank you so much!

3489
03:00:42,640 --> 03:00:43,560
I told you.

3490
03:00:43,640 --> 03:00:45,500
It's because of that big brain strat, right?

3491
03:00:45,780 --> 03:00:48,120
You're like, oh my god, why didn't I think of that?

3492
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:49,040
Hahaha.

3493
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:56,820
He did say, timer starts when you get in the car.

3494
03:00:58,240 --> 03:00:58,920
Wait!

3495
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:01,560
Guys, you did say

3496
03:01:13,940 --> 03:01:15,800
It's the cards I didn't get.

3497
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:16,980
Was it 250?

3498
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:19,680
Was it 250?

3499
03:01:20,600 --> 03:01:22,260
Fuck, I lost my train of thought.

3500
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:23,460
Hahaha.

3501
03:01:26,260 --> 03:01:27,880
I forgot what I was going to say.

3502
03:01:29,020 --> 03:01:30,760
What was I trying to say?

3503
03:01:31,260 --> 03:01:32,440
I don't remember.

3504
03:01:36,970 --> 03:01:38,130
I don't remember.

3505
03:01:41,050 --> 03:01:42,550
Brain is so tired.

3506
03:01:43,170 --> 03:01:43,790
Oh my god!

3507
03:01:43,850 --> 03:01:44,230
Okay, I remember.

3508
03:01:44,670 --> 03:01:50,370
Okay, so you guys said the last the last couple levels is like incredibly difficult because it's timed.

3509
03:01:50,990 --> 03:01:55,650
But like, but like, does that mean I can do the car strat?

3510
03:01:56,190 --> 03:01:56,590
Hahaha.

3511
03:01:56,770 --> 03:02:02,690
Does that mean the car strat will work?

3512
03:02:03,450 --> 03:02:07,570
If I just walk?

3513
03:02:08,090 --> 03:02:08,450
Hahaha.

3514
03:02:13,010 --> 03:02:13,670
Wait!

3515
03:02:13,670 --> 03:02:15,490
What do you mean?

3516
03:02:16,070 --> 03:02:17,410
It worked here.

3517
03:02:18,470 --> 03:02:19,930
The lumber king.

3518
03:02:20,670 --> 03:02:20,970
God.

3519
03:02:21,090 --> 03:02:22,950
Okay, if I destroy cars, I get money, right?

3520
03:02:23,030 --> 03:02:24,670
I just have to destroy other people's cars.

3521
03:02:25,570 --> 03:02:26,670
Wait, you're right.

3522
03:02:27,050 --> 03:02:27,770
To myself.

3523
03:02:28,190 --> 03:02:31,050
Like I said, you're right as I talk to myself.

3524
03:02:31,830 --> 03:02:33,010
Oh my god, Doki.

3525
03:02:33,150 --> 03:02:34,070
You're so right.

3526
03:02:35,030 --> 03:02:35,310
Okay.

3527
03:02:36,230 --> 03:02:36,970
Cat, thank you.

3528
03:02:37,090 --> 03:02:38,170
Welcome to tomato farm.

3529
03:02:38,450 --> 03:02:39,210
Welcome, welcome.

3530
03:02:39,550 --> 03:02:41,590
Look, I was just telling myself that I'm right.

3531
03:02:41,590 --> 03:02:43,310
Alright, get over here.

3532
03:02:43,730 --> 03:02:44,570
I need your money.

3533
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:46,290
I need money.

3534
03:02:47,410 --> 03:02:49,730
Money can be exchanged for goods and services.

3535
03:02:51,890 --> 03:02:54,230
Doki is so cool.

3536
03:02:55,950 --> 03:02:56,830
There you go.

3537
03:02:57,630 --> 03:02:57,990
Nice.

3538
03:02:58,130 --> 03:02:58,390
Alright.

3539
03:02:59,050 --> 03:02:59,730
You next.

3540
03:02:59,830 --> 03:03:00,230
Oh shit.

3541
03:03:00,310 --> 03:03:00,890
Wait, nevermind.

3542
03:03:01,530 --> 03:03:02,430
I need to fix my car.

3543
03:03:02,530 --> 03:03:03,130
Give me a sec.

3544
03:03:03,470 --> 03:03:04,410
I'll be back.

3545
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:06,530
You think you're safe?

3546
03:03:06,790 --> 03:03:08,050
I'll be back.

3547
03:03:10,130 --> 03:03:12,530
Alright, here you go.

3548
03:03:12,530 --> 03:03:13,030
Alright.

3549
03:03:14,010 --> 03:03:14,350
Nice.

3550
03:03:15,190 --> 03:03:16,310
Alright, here you go.

3551
03:03:16,570 --> 03:03:17,230
Who's next?

3552
03:03:17,850 --> 03:03:18,170
You!

3553
03:03:21,970 --> 03:03:22,300
You!

3554
03:03:24,430 --> 03:03:25,250
That's right.

3555
03:03:25,310 --> 03:03:25,930
Who's next?

3556
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:27,570
Oh, you saw that?

3557
03:03:28,050 --> 03:03:29,370
Good for you.

3558
03:03:30,630 --> 03:03:31,970
You saw that?

3559
03:03:32,250 --> 03:03:33,690
That's right, you did.

3560
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:39,100
Isn't it great?

3561
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:42,020
People are lining up to get, like, to die.

3562
03:03:44,420 --> 03:03:45,480
Look, look at that.

3563
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:46,300
There's this other car.

3564
03:03:47,180 --> 03:03:48,000
Wait your turn!

3565
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:50,840
Wait your turn, sir!

3566
03:03:51,980 --> 03:03:52,960
Wait your- you know what?

3567
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:53,840
Two for one special.

3568
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:56,600
Alright.

3569
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:57,600
Oh shit, I have to wait.

3570
03:03:57,720 --> 03:03:58,320
Give me a sec.

3571
03:03:58,440 --> 03:03:59,100
Stay there.

3572
03:03:59,540 --> 03:04:00,640
I gotta wait.

3573
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:02,540
Stay there.

3574
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:03,420
Just stay there.

3575
03:04:03,420 --> 03:04:05,680
Stay there!

3576
03:04:18,390 --> 03:04:20,530
Why didn't you listen?

3577
03:04:21,150 --> 03:04:23,430
I said stay there!

3578
03:04:27,500 --> 03:04:28,040
Get it.

3579
03:04:28,240 --> 03:04:28,560
Get it.

3580
03:04:28,720 --> 03:04:29,480
Get it.

3581
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:34,560
It's okay.

3582
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:36,020
I'm safe.

3583
03:04:36,640 --> 03:04:37,700
You housed a criminal.

3584
03:04:38,380 --> 03:04:39,640
Stop resisting.

3585
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:40,200
Alright.

3586
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:41,560
It's fine.

3587
03:04:42,500 --> 03:04:43,560
It's fine.

3588
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:44,360
Alright.

3589
03:04:44,580 --> 03:04:45,360
You're next.

3590
03:04:46,380 --> 03:04:48,140
This is the easiest way to earn money.

3591
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:49,940
Alright.

3592
03:04:50,380 --> 03:04:51,160
There we go.

3593
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:53,540
Alright, guys.

3594
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:54,500
You!

3595
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:57,860
You!

3596
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:02,060
Yeah!

3597
03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:06,860
Do you not see I'm doing something very important?

3598
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:08,180
There we go.

3599
03:05:08,900 --> 03:05:09,860
There we go.

3600
03:05:09,980 --> 03:05:10,640
We're good now.

3601
03:05:11,480 --> 03:05:13,080
This is my job.

3602
03:05:13,880 --> 03:05:17,720
Why do I look for money when the money can come to me?

3603
03:05:20,340 --> 03:05:21,040
Alright.

3604
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:23,980
Cool, Lisa.

3605
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:27,140
I'm so cool now.

3606
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:28,740
Yippee!

3607
03:05:29,280 --> 03:05:30,380
I'm so cool!

3608
03:05:31,320 --> 03:05:33,620
Look how cool I am!

3609
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:34,560
Yippee!

3610
03:05:34,560 --> 03:05:35,720
Yippee!

3611
03:05:37,500 --> 03:05:40,240
Guys, I can't afford Florida.

3612
03:05:40,400 --> 03:05:41,240
We gotta...

3613
03:05:41,240 --> 03:05:50,260
Guys, I wonder if anybody has ever pulled in money together to just buy a state.

3614
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:57,960
Guys, if you think about it, if everyone, if all the dragoons pull in their money, we can legally buy a country.

3615
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:05,200
We can make a Kickstarter and just legally buy a country.

3616
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:06,980
Or Florida.

3617
03:06:09,940 --> 03:06:12,100
What's the cheapest state you can buy?

3618
03:06:14,340 --> 03:06:17,460
I don't think that's how it works.

3619
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:24,760
Guys, we can have a Kickstarter!

3620
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:27,520
Let's pull in all our money together!

3621
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:27,820
Let's do it together!

3622
03:06:31,300 --> 03:06:34,220
Wyoming is the cheapest state.

3623
03:06:39,020 --> 03:06:39,960
Alright, hello.

3624
03:06:41,740 --> 03:06:44,140
We can buy a town!

3625
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:44,880
Wait!

3626
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:48,440
Okay, if we don't make enough money, we'll buy a town.

3627
03:06:50,720 --> 03:06:52,600
Okay, I'm cool-dokey now.

3628
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:54,500
I'm so cool.

3629
03:06:54,500 --> 03:06:54,560
Let's go.

3630
03:06:57,420 --> 03:06:59,000
Oh yeah, I'm trying to get in.

3631
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:08,450
Alright, follow Snake and find three strikes of evidence against him.

3632
03:07:08,530 --> 03:07:09,810
Don't miss any items.

3633
03:07:10,630 --> 03:07:12,370
Why do I have to drive?

3634
03:07:13,170 --> 03:07:13,530
Alright.

3635
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:22,530
Yeah, we can just buy like a small town that has like a population of like 500 or something.

3636
03:07:23,530 --> 03:07:24,870
And we all pull our money together.

3637
03:07:28,550 --> 03:07:29,830
I can be mayor!

3638
03:07:31,290 --> 03:07:33,870
I mean, I feel like I'd be a really good mayor though.

3639
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:41,320
Wait.

3640
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:43,960
That's only strike two?

3641
03:07:44,220 --> 03:07:45,600
I've been doing that all day.

3642
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:47,820
Ah, yes.

3643
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:52,220
Your $50 can contribute to Doki Land or Doki Town.

3644
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:58,600
As someone who lives here, oh wait.

3645
03:07:58,860 --> 03:08:03,620
I promise you don't want to buy this freaking magnet of a state.

3646
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:06,700
Alright, I gotta go back to the casino.

3647
03:08:06,840 --> 03:08:08,900
Why the fuck is that time?

3648
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:15,580
Alright.

3649
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:18,920
What do I- okay, it's over here.

3650
03:08:20,060 --> 03:08:20,660
I was gonna say.

3651
03:08:21,440 --> 03:08:22,360
Oh my god.

3652
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:23,600
Oh my god.

3653
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:26,240
Why can't I cheese this like I did before?

3654
03:08:29,380 --> 03:08:32,200
Just buy a microstate.

3655
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:35,080
They're not legally recognized anyway.

3656
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:37,360
Thank you for the super chat.

3657
03:08:37,480 --> 03:08:38,560
Thank you, thank you.

3658
03:08:38,900 --> 03:08:47,260
Guys, maybe one day we can make Doki Land a reality or Doki Town a reality.

3659
03:08:50,640 --> 03:08:52,040
Yay!

3660
03:09:09,220 --> 03:09:10,620
Yay!

3661
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:14,680
Yeah!

3662
03:09:14,760 --> 03:09:15,620
We did it!

3663
03:09:19,320 --> 03:09:21,200
Drive to Captain Mcglass.

3664
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:22,820
I should be able to steal his car.

3665
03:09:22,980 --> 03:09:24,200
I completed his mission.

3666
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:25,840
Alright, chief.

3667
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:27,400
I need money.

3668
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:31,680
I will not stop until I get Florida.

3669
03:09:33,020 --> 03:09:33,660
Plow King.

3670
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:37,580
Alright, chief.

3671
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:38,680
Oh, he's gone.

3672
03:09:38,860 --> 03:09:40,540
I can commit lots of crime now.

3673
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:42,240
He's gone, guys.

3674
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:46,080
Alright, there has to be a car.

3675
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:47,200
Alright, here we go.

3676
03:09:48,420 --> 03:09:49,220
You.

3677
03:09:49,940 --> 03:09:50,220
No!

3678
03:09:51,660 --> 03:09:53,840
How did he juke me?

3679
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:56,020
I said you!

3680
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:00,840
It should work.

3681
03:10:02,480 --> 03:10:03,900
I said you.

3682
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:08,760
Alright.

3683
03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:11,780
Don't worry.

3684
03:10:15,140 --> 03:10:15,720
Alright.

3685
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:16,300
Get over here.

3686
03:10:16,840 --> 03:10:17,860
Both of you.

3687
03:10:19,360 --> 03:10:20,720
I need money.

3688
03:10:23,300 --> 03:10:24,380
Get over here.

3689
03:10:24,480 --> 03:10:25,500
Start steaming!

3690
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:29,320
Don't make me bring the bus!

3691
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:33,500
I will bring the bus!

3692
03:10:33,640 --> 03:10:34,200
Wait a minute.

3693
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:35,280
They're so tanky.

3694
03:10:36,180 --> 03:10:37,860
Wait, why are they so tanky?

3695
03:10:40,980 --> 03:10:42,220
Why are they so tanky?

3696
03:10:42,220 --> 03:10:42,780
What the fuck?

3697
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,720
How are you guys so tanky?

3698
03:10:48,240 --> 03:10:49,880
You're supposed to explode!

3699
03:10:51,780 --> 03:10:52,620
Oh no.

3700
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:54,240
I hit him one more time.

3701
03:10:55,120 --> 03:10:56,260
Okay, give me a sec.

3702
03:10:56,580 --> 03:10:58,020
Wait, he hit me!

3703
03:10:58,660 --> 03:10:59,700
He hit me!

3704
03:10:59,840 --> 03:11:00,220
Officer!

3705
03:11:01,620 --> 03:11:03,160
He hit me!

3706
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:08,860
Wait!

3707
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:11,220
That's not fair!

3708
03:11:13,980 --> 03:11:15,800
I didn't do anything!

3709
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:16,600
I did nothing!

3710
03:11:17,900 --> 03:11:18,840
He hit me!

3711
03:11:19,200 --> 03:11:19,860
He hit me!

3712
03:11:22,780 --> 03:11:23,440
No!

3713
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:27,620
No!

3714
03:11:28,880 --> 03:11:32,320
Oh my god, I'm still okay.

3715
03:11:32,940 --> 03:11:34,760
I'm first frame!

3716
03:11:34,760 --> 03:11:36,500
I was framed!

3717
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:37,480
Officer!

3718
03:11:38,540 --> 03:11:39,640
I was framed!

3719
03:11:42,390 --> 03:11:44,500
I did not commit no crime!

3720
03:11:46,420 --> 03:11:47,820
He framed me!

3721
03:11:51,580 --> 03:11:54,160
She did nothing wrong!

3722
03:11:56,410 --> 03:11:57,440
I give up.

3723
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:01,000
I give up, guys.

3724
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:05,240
I was doing different crimes!

3725
03:12:05,700 --> 03:12:08,220
This wasn't the crime I committed!

3726
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:10,820
Oh, I'm stuck.

3727
03:12:11,860 --> 03:12:12,420
Guys!

3728
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:13,840
Guys!

3729
03:12:15,080 --> 03:12:15,420
Guys!

3730
03:12:15,580 --> 03:12:16,420
No, I saw him!

3731
03:12:21,880 --> 03:12:24,340
Oh my god, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

3732
03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:26,640
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

3733
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:28,740
Alright, I need something faster.

3734
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,220
Okay, no!

3735
03:12:36,860 --> 03:12:37,380
Alright.

3736
03:12:38,700 --> 03:12:39,580
Here we go.

3737
03:12:40,060 --> 03:12:40,820
I'm sad.

3738
03:12:47,640 --> 03:12:50,120
I can't believe it.

3739
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,440
I can't believe it.

3740
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:56,160
I just...

3741
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:58,440
Women just want one thing.

3742
03:13:03,260 --> 03:13:06,820
Oh yeah, you're right.

3743
03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:07,580
I should save.

3744
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:08,840
You're right, guys.

3745
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:09,740
Good idea.

3746
03:13:11,280 --> 03:13:12,120
I didn't save.

3747
03:13:13,120 --> 03:13:13,400
Alright.

3748
03:13:16,620 --> 03:13:17,600
Alright, let's go.

3749
03:13:22,040 --> 03:13:23,340
I see, captain.

3750
03:13:23,520 --> 03:13:24,160
I'm here.

3751
03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:27,820
I'm here to be cool.

3752
03:13:28,720 --> 03:13:30,260
But also, maybe there's money here.

3753
03:13:30,260 --> 03:13:32,280
Yes, there is!

3754
03:13:33,820 --> 03:13:34,540
Nice.

3755
03:13:35,480 --> 03:13:36,200
Yippee!

3756
03:13:36,660 --> 03:13:37,080
Money!

3757
03:13:38,480 --> 03:13:39,200
Yippee!

3758
03:13:42,020 --> 03:13:42,740
Alright.

3759
03:13:43,460 --> 03:13:44,880
Money, money, money.

3760
03:13:45,080 --> 03:13:46,320
I like money.

3761
03:13:47,900 --> 03:13:49,520
Alright, nice.

3762
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:50,940
Is there any money up top?

3763
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:53,640
No, there isn't.

3764
03:13:53,820 --> 03:13:55,860
I guess I'll talk to the sea, captain.

3765
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:59,700
Hello, hello, captain.

3766
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:12,860
What?

3767
03:14:17,320 --> 03:14:18,800
What favor?

3768
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:19,000
What favor?

3769
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:29,340
Not the fish!

3770
03:14:31,460 --> 03:14:33,000
Save the sea, captain's fish.

3771
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:34,120
Collect all the fish.

3772
03:14:35,620 --> 03:14:37,540
Before the time runs out.

3773
03:14:37,740 --> 03:14:38,620
Okay, get in my vehicle.

3774
03:14:38,680 --> 03:14:39,220
Where is it?

3775
03:14:39,900 --> 03:14:42,540
Alright, Skinner, we're gonna save the fish, guys!

3776
03:14:44,260 --> 03:14:46,520
It's okay, they can survive a little longer.

3777
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:47,500
They're mutated.

3778
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:50,900
It's fine.

3779
03:14:51,960 --> 03:14:56,500
In fact, you might say they're sort of able to breathe a little bit outside of water.

3780
03:14:57,940 --> 03:14:59,240
Wait, where's the other fish?

3781
03:15:00,540 --> 03:15:01,780
Oh, it's a- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3782
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:02,880
Okay, give me a sec.

3783
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:04,860
Wait, there's 22?!

3784
03:15:04,860 --> 03:15:06,680
Oh, fuck, I have to be a little faster.

3785
03:15:07,860 --> 03:15:09,520
I didn't realize there were 22 of them.

3786
03:15:14,860 --> 03:15:15,300
Alright.

3787
03:15:16,280 --> 03:15:16,780
Alright.

3788
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:17,880
Alright, here we go.

3789
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:19,820
We're almost there.

3790
03:15:20,340 --> 03:15:21,340
Just 5%.

3791
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:24,140
Oh, no.

3792
03:15:24,500 --> 03:15:24,920
Oh, no.

3793
03:15:25,060 --> 03:15:26,000
Get out of the road!

3794
03:15:26,340 --> 03:15:28,560
This is for cars only!

3795
03:15:31,500 --> 03:15:31,780
Alright.

3796
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:35,220
Nice.

3797
03:15:37,720 --> 03:15:39,160
Oh, hey, it's Krusty Land.

3798
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:40,860
It's Bar- What was it called?

3799
03:15:40,980 --> 03:15:41,500
Beer Land?

3800
03:15:41,500 --> 03:15:43,580
Beer Land?

3801
03:15:43,580 --> 03:15:44,720
Wait, there's Krusty Studios?

3802
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:47,360
I could be going to Krusty Studios right now?

3803
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:49,800
Oh, my God, there's money there.

3804
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:51,520
That's where all the celebrities are.

3805
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:53,700
Celebrities have money?

3806
03:15:54,780 --> 03:15:55,980
Oh, yeah, it's Duff Land.

3807
03:15:56,180 --> 03:15:56,840
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3808
03:15:56,940 --> 03:15:58,080
Like, it's one of the lands.

3809
03:16:00,520 --> 03:16:02,180
I was like, what was it called again?

3810
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:03,500
Oh, no.

3811
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:06,040
Oh, no, I can't- I can't think right now.

3812
03:16:06,940 --> 03:16:08,660
I have to go get more fish.

3813
03:16:11,500 --> 03:16:12,140
Oh, no.

3814
03:16:12,280 --> 03:16:14,400
Why are they so far from each other?

3815
03:16:18,100 --> 03:16:20,360
Skidder, drive faster in your fucking sedan!

3816
03:16:24,270 --> 03:16:25,830
How are they so far?

3817
03:16:26,110 --> 03:16:29,330
Oh, guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

3818
03:16:29,970 --> 03:16:30,190
No!

3819
03:16:35,270 --> 03:16:35,830
No!

3820
03:16:37,890 --> 03:16:40,230
I had to fucking you turn.

3821
03:16:40,230 --> 03:16:46,290
I had to- Okay, okay, I won't fuck around this time.

3822
03:16:48,050 --> 03:16:50,030
Guys, I won't fuck around this time.

3823
03:16:51,030 --> 03:16:52,030
I got this.

3824
03:16:52,730 --> 03:16:55,350
God, the time event is so brutal.

3825
03:16:56,510 --> 03:16:58,010
It's actually so brutal.

3826
03:16:58,910 --> 03:17:00,010
I have to go straight in.

3827
03:17:02,390 --> 03:17:02,970
Alright.

3828
03:17:04,410 --> 03:17:04,790
Oh!

3829
03:17:06,550 --> 03:17:07,350
It's okay.

3830
03:17:07,350 --> 03:17:07,390
It's okay.

3831
03:17:07,810 --> 03:17:09,190
I need to learn how to drift.

3832
03:17:12,670 --> 03:17:12,950
Alright.

3833
03:17:16,790 --> 03:17:17,150
Oh!

3834
03:17:17,790 --> 03:17:18,410
We're gonna make it.

3835
03:17:18,410 --> 03:17:19,250
We're gonna make it this time.

3836
03:17:19,850 --> 03:17:20,870
We have a lot more time.

3837
03:17:22,230 --> 03:17:22,810
Oh, no.

3838
03:17:23,890 --> 03:17:26,330
Please, please get away from me!

3839
03:17:28,190 --> 03:17:29,290
Move out of the way!

3840
03:17:33,140 --> 03:17:33,620
Okay, a minute.

3841
03:17:34,740 --> 03:17:35,120
Get out!

3842
03:17:35,360 --> 03:17:36,180
Get out of the way!

3843
03:17:36,920 --> 03:17:38,340
I have an important mission!

3844
03:17:41,780 --> 03:17:42,200
Alright.

3845
03:17:42,740 --> 03:17:43,340
It's okay.

3846
03:17:43,440 --> 03:17:43,760
It's fine.

3847
03:17:43,820 --> 03:17:44,420
It's fine.

3848
03:17:44,460 --> 03:17:44,760
It's fine.

3849
03:17:44,840 --> 03:17:45,080
It's fine.

3850
03:17:45,120 --> 03:17:45,760
Everything's fine.

3851
03:17:46,660 --> 03:17:46,940
Alright.

3852
03:17:47,160 --> 03:17:48,100
50 seconds.

3853
03:17:48,920 --> 03:17:50,000
I can do this in 50 seconds.

3854
03:17:50,940 --> 03:17:52,240
As long as I keep driving.

3855
03:17:52,380 --> 03:17:53,060
Just keep driving.

3856
03:17:53,380 --> 03:17:54,780
Just keep driving, Skinner.

3857
03:17:56,540 --> 03:17:56,960
It's alright.

3858
03:17:57,480 --> 03:17:59,360
Your mom likes it when you go fast.

3859
03:18:00,260 --> 03:18:01,500
It'll make your mom sad.

3860
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:02,380
It'll make your mom sad.

3861
03:18:05,010 --> 03:18:06,650
There's no way I missed one.

3862
03:18:06,750 --> 03:18:07,650
No, don't say that.

3863
03:18:07,930 --> 03:18:09,470
Don't say that, guys.

3864
03:18:09,570 --> 03:18:10,050
Don't say that.

3865
03:18:10,510 --> 03:18:11,930
The arrows didn't say I missed any.

3866
03:18:16,550 --> 03:18:17,530
No, no!

3867
03:18:17,770 --> 03:18:18,310
Not again!

3868
03:18:18,690 --> 03:18:20,810
Not again!

3869
03:18:20,810 --> 03:18:20,990
Not again!

3870
03:18:24,530 --> 03:18:25,010
No!

3871
03:18:26,090 --> 03:18:27,190
Now I'm stuck!

3872
03:18:42,780 --> 03:18:44,340
Okay, I'm figuring it out.

3873
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:46,300
No, actually.

3874
03:18:46,660 --> 03:18:50,440
No, I accidentally missed that in my car!

3875
03:18:56,820 --> 03:18:57,360
Alright.

3876
03:19:00,320 --> 03:19:01,080
It's fine.

3877
03:19:02,240 --> 03:19:02,620
Okay.

3878
03:19:03,620 --> 03:19:05,760
I'm learning how to drift, guys.

3879
03:19:06,900 --> 03:19:08,100
I figured it out.

3880
03:19:08,320 --> 03:19:09,160
I figured it out.

3881
03:19:09,160 --> 03:19:11,660
As long as I go straight, it should be fine.

3882
03:19:14,900 --> 03:19:16,360
Oh my god, get out.

3883
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:18,060
Move out of the way!

3884
03:19:19,940 --> 03:19:21,360
Stop being on the road!

3885
03:19:27,080 --> 03:19:27,520
Alright.

3886
03:19:28,520 --> 03:19:29,000
Here we go.

3887
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:35,420
Okay, I have not slowed down at all.

3888
03:19:35,580 --> 03:19:37,420
There's no way I can fuck this up this time.

3889
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:40,380
Jesus Christ.

3890
03:19:41,080 --> 03:19:42,600
I'm even taking shortcuts.

3891
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:50,060
No, it's a bored road.

3892
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:51,680
Guys.

3893
03:19:52,500 --> 03:19:54,020
Cars have to right away.

3894
03:19:57,640 --> 03:19:58,820
This is a minute.

3895
03:19:58,940 --> 03:19:59,560
I got a whole minute.

3896
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:00,360
I got a whole minute.

3897
03:20:04,460 --> 03:20:04,980
Alright.

3898
03:20:05,840 --> 03:20:06,720
45 seconds.

3899
03:20:07,020 --> 03:20:07,540
Come on!

3900
03:20:07,540 --> 03:20:09,860
They're so fucking far away from each other!

3901
03:20:10,860 --> 03:20:13,780
Guys, I think I should not have brought a sedan for this mission.

3902
03:20:17,240 --> 03:20:17,760
No!

3903
03:20:23,550 --> 03:20:24,070
No!

3904
03:20:27,230 --> 03:20:29,510
I just said the sedan might have been the problem.

3905
03:20:30,190 --> 03:20:34,790
I think bringing a family car might have been the issue.

3906
03:20:36,870 --> 03:20:37,690
No, no, no.

3907
03:20:37,690 --> 03:20:39,910
Oh my god, there it is.

3908
03:20:39,910 --> 03:20:40,730
There it is.

3909
03:20:41,610 --> 03:20:42,170
Yay!

3910
03:20:44,270 --> 03:20:45,790
I made it!

3911
03:20:46,950 --> 03:20:48,970
I made it, guys.

3912
03:20:49,970 --> 03:20:54,590
I don't know about you, but that looks like a car that made it.

3913
03:20:55,290 --> 03:20:56,750
Guys, please don't touch my car.

3914
03:20:57,690 --> 03:20:58,450
Guys, please.

3915
03:20:59,190 --> 03:21:00,470
Please don't touch my car.

3916
03:21:00,630 --> 03:21:01,690
I just...

3917
03:21:03,450 --> 03:21:04,830
Guys, guys, please.

3918
03:21:04,830 --> 03:21:06,070
Please don't touch my car.

3919
03:21:06,210 --> 03:21:07,010
Guys, please.

3920
03:21:07,130 --> 03:21:09,230
I have like...

3921
03:21:09,230 --> 03:21:09,990
Please, please.

3922
03:21:10,330 --> 03:21:11,590
Please don't touch my car.

3923
03:21:11,710 --> 03:21:13,430
I have 1 HP on my car.

3924
03:21:16,170 --> 03:21:16,730
Okay.

3925
03:21:18,830 --> 03:21:20,830
Alright, we just gotta be safe.

3926
03:21:21,270 --> 03:21:21,550
Now.

3927
03:21:23,070 --> 03:21:27,670
As long as no other car runs into me, everything will be okay.

3928
03:21:27,930 --> 03:21:30,250
I drive and follow...

3929
03:21:30,890 --> 03:21:34,270
I drive and follow traffic laws now.

3930
03:21:34,870 --> 03:21:35,590
Alright?

3931
03:21:35,910 --> 03:21:37,430
I'm on the left side.

3932
03:21:37,530 --> 03:21:38,530
Look at me go.

3933
03:21:39,170 --> 03:21:41,590
I'm following traffic rules.

3934
03:21:42,450 --> 03:21:42,930
Beep, beep.

3935
03:21:43,050 --> 03:21:43,470
Left turn.

3936
03:21:44,950 --> 03:21:45,930
Right turn.

3937
03:21:47,050 --> 03:21:49,210
If anybody hits me, it's...

3938
03:21:49,210 --> 03:21:52,330
If anybody hits me, it's their fault.

3939
03:21:54,830 --> 03:21:56,170
There we go.

3940
03:21:56,850 --> 03:21:58,250
Look at us go.

3941
03:21:58,850 --> 03:22:00,810
We're law-abiding citizens.

3942
03:22:03,770 --> 03:22:04,790
Look at that.

3943
03:22:05,150 --> 03:22:06,690
Everything is fine.

3944
03:22:06,870 --> 03:22:08,510
Let me just slowly go.

3945
03:22:08,910 --> 03:22:11,390
Alright, now we can do whatever the fuck we want.

3946
03:22:13,150 --> 03:22:13,490
Woo!

3947
03:22:17,330 --> 03:22:20,490
Alright, nice.

3948
03:22:21,150 --> 03:22:22,430
See, everything is fine now.

3949
03:22:23,570 --> 03:22:23,930
Yay!

3950
03:22:29,150 --> 03:22:30,950
Okay, that's a little awkward.

3951
03:22:31,630 --> 03:22:33,670
Alright, so I see the captain again.

3952
03:22:36,090 --> 03:22:36,590
Yay!

3953
03:22:40,790 --> 03:22:42,310
I made it!

3954
03:22:42,710 --> 03:22:44,290
See, look, I'm on the other side.

3955
03:22:44,470 --> 03:22:45,550
I made it!

3956
03:22:50,890 --> 03:22:51,490
Alright.

3957
03:22:51,670 --> 03:22:53,490
We're almost at the sea, captain.

3958
03:22:55,790 --> 03:22:57,750
I did the thing, captain!

3959
03:22:59,430 --> 03:23:00,030
Hello!

3960
03:23:02,510 --> 03:23:04,350
Still counts, exactly.

3961
03:23:08,450 --> 03:23:09,170
Really?

3962
03:23:09,250 --> 03:23:10,010
Where did he go?

3963
03:23:12,330 --> 03:23:12,850
Huh?

3964
03:23:15,850 --> 03:23:16,870
What is it?

3965
03:23:17,350 --> 03:23:19,690
Destroy the black limo to find Bart?

3966
03:23:20,070 --> 03:23:22,770
No, I wanted to go to the...

3967
03:23:22,770 --> 03:23:26,390
I wanted to go to the fucking...

3968
03:23:26,390 --> 03:23:27,910
The Krusty Land.

3969
03:23:29,590 --> 03:23:31,110
Oh my god, wait, that's a cop.

3970
03:23:32,450 --> 03:23:34,990
Wait, okay, I should not have a sedan for this.

3971
03:23:37,550 --> 03:23:38,750
Oh my god!

3972
03:23:39,530 --> 03:23:42,850
Why do I keep using a sedan for these missions?

3973
03:23:45,630 --> 03:23:47,230
Oh, this is gonna take a while.

3974
03:23:47,430 --> 03:23:49,230
This is gonna take a while.

3975
03:23:49,870 --> 03:23:51,090
I got the wrong car.

3976
03:23:51,390 --> 03:23:53,710
How was I supposed to know I had to destroy a car?

3977
03:23:54,630 --> 03:23:55,910
I thought I was gonna do errands!

3978
03:23:57,070 --> 03:23:59,070
This is my errand car!

3979
03:24:04,610 --> 03:24:06,010
There we go.

3980
03:24:07,990 --> 03:24:08,610
Alright.

3981
03:24:10,490 --> 03:24:11,830
He's almost down.

3982
03:24:13,150 --> 03:24:14,070
There we go.

3983
03:24:14,670 --> 03:24:15,230
We're halfway.

3984
03:24:15,930 --> 03:24:17,590
You know what, the sedan ain't so bad.

3985
03:24:18,050 --> 03:24:20,710
Oh, my sedan's about to fucking explode.

3986
03:24:25,910 --> 03:24:27,230
Alright, give me a sec.

3987
03:24:27,310 --> 03:24:28,970
I gotta find a wrench.

3988
03:24:29,450 --> 03:24:30,350
Real quick.

3989
03:24:30,470 --> 03:24:31,490
Okay, I'll be back.

3990
03:24:31,590 --> 03:24:32,270
Alright, there we go.

3991
03:24:35,890 --> 03:24:36,630
Alright, we're fine.

3992
03:24:37,410 --> 03:24:38,310
We're okay now.

3993
03:24:42,150 --> 03:24:42,750
There we go.

3994
03:24:46,150 --> 03:24:47,030
Get down!

3995
03:24:49,590 --> 03:24:50,570
You know they're not!

3996
03:24:50,650 --> 03:24:51,450
We're in Springfield!

3997
03:24:51,510 --> 03:24:53,570
Who the fuck recycles in Springfield?

3998
03:24:53,570 --> 03:24:54,690
Yo, man.

3999
03:24:54,690 --> 03:24:55,250
Yo, man.

4000
03:24:56,490 --> 03:24:58,430
Are you watching?

4001
03:25:00,130 --> 03:25:01,170
Oh my god, he's 1 HP.

4002
03:25:02,110 --> 03:25:03,050
He's 1 HP.

4003
03:25:03,970 --> 03:25:04,390
Please.

4004
03:25:05,190 --> 03:25:06,650
Please, no, not uphill!

4005
03:25:07,230 --> 03:25:08,570
Not uphill!

4006
03:25:09,790 --> 03:25:10,610
No!

4007
03:25:12,430 --> 03:25:14,510
No, my one weakness!

4008
03:25:16,910 --> 03:25:17,550
No!

4009
03:25:21,670 --> 03:25:22,530
No!

4010
03:25:22,530 --> 03:25:22,590
No!

4011
03:25:23,170 --> 03:25:24,030
Crash, please!

4012
03:25:24,730 --> 03:25:25,150
Crash!

4013
03:25:30,410 --> 03:25:31,450
Oh, no!

4014
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:31,950
I did it!

4015
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:37,260
Alright.

4016
03:25:38,460 --> 03:25:40,740
Okay, I have a real car for this now.

4017
03:25:41,760 --> 03:25:42,300
Alright.

4018
03:25:43,100 --> 03:25:44,040
Alright, get out.

4019
03:25:45,320 --> 03:25:46,160
They crashed.

4020
03:25:46,360 --> 03:25:49,080
They like crashed into me and still didn't register!

4021
03:25:50,420 --> 03:25:52,320
Alright, now I have a real car for this.

4022
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:56,660
Alright, it's fine.

4023
03:26:00,440 --> 03:26:02,640
It's fine, it's fine.

4024
03:26:03,120 --> 03:26:04,300
I have a real car now.

4025
03:26:04,980 --> 03:26:08,120
It should do like triple the damage instead of a fucking sedan.

4026
03:26:08,460 --> 03:26:13,060
Okay, this should have done triple the damage looking at the stats.

4027
03:26:13,360 --> 03:26:17,300
It should have done triple damage but I guess not?

4028
03:26:17,800 --> 03:26:21,500
How did I do less damage than the fucking sedan?

4029
03:26:21,500 --> 03:26:23,740
I don't understand!

4030
03:26:23,740 --> 03:26:23,940
I don't understand!

4031
03:26:26,580 --> 03:26:28,320
You can hit it.

4032
03:26:30,400 --> 03:26:31,900
Oh my god.

4033
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:33,240
Guys, this is going worse.

4034
03:26:34,520 --> 03:26:36,760
I don't know how that's possible.

4035
03:26:36,920 --> 03:26:37,540
Okay, there we go.

4036
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:39,200
I did more than I ever done before.

4037
03:26:41,720 --> 03:26:42,320
No.

4038
03:26:42,640 --> 03:26:43,440
No, please.

4039
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:45,220
I saved so much money.

4040
03:26:48,800 --> 03:26:49,400
Please.

4041
03:26:52,320 --> 03:26:52,920
Please.

4042
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:54,020
No, no, don't.

4043
03:26:54,940 --> 03:26:56,500
Don't, don't, don't hit them!

4044
03:26:58,360 --> 03:26:59,820
Don't push me into them!

4045
03:27:00,300 --> 03:27:00,820
Please!

4046
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:05,200
I can't afford to go to jail again!

4047
03:27:09,120 --> 03:27:09,720
Please.

4048
03:27:10,540 --> 03:27:11,860
Please go over there.

4049
03:27:15,020 --> 03:27:15,680
Please.

4050
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:16,140
Please!

4051
03:27:16,140 --> 03:27:17,220
Just hit something!

4052
03:27:20,400 --> 03:27:21,760
Oh my god!

4053
03:27:21,820 --> 03:27:22,680
I missed!

4054
03:27:26,600 --> 03:27:29,040
Guys, I don't think we're gonna hit him.

4055
03:27:29,660 --> 03:27:32,340
I hit him once and that was it.

4056
03:27:33,380 --> 03:27:34,040
Unless...

4057
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:34,880
No, he turned.

4058
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:35,740
He turned!

4059
03:27:37,200 --> 03:27:39,140
He fucking did!

4060
03:27:39,140 --> 03:27:41,100
Alright, this is okay.

4061
03:27:41,280 --> 03:27:43,040
I got this now.

4062
03:27:43,400 --> 03:27:47,620
And he hit zero damage?!

4063
03:27:47,620 --> 03:27:50,160
I crashed into you head on!

4064
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:51,280
I'm stuck.

4065
03:27:53,500 --> 03:27:54,380
How?

4066
03:27:54,820 --> 03:27:55,220
How?

4067
03:27:55,380 --> 03:27:57,240
I crashed into you!

4068
03:28:01,020 --> 03:28:02,180
I don't understand.

4069
03:28:03,520 --> 03:28:04,860
I don't understand!

4070
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:08,080
I crashed into you!

4071
03:28:08,800 --> 03:28:11,180
How are you able to live?!

4072
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:14,340
Oh my god!

4073
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:18,200
I can't believe it.

4074
03:28:18,400 --> 03:28:21,000
The closest progress I ever made was to Sedan.

4075
03:28:21,400 --> 03:28:23,120
I can't believe it.

4076
03:28:23,800 --> 03:28:25,620
It's military grade limo.

4077
03:28:27,720 --> 03:28:29,700
What is this made out of?

4078
03:28:32,380 --> 03:28:33,180
Please!

4079
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:34,280
Crash!

4080
03:28:34,740 --> 03:28:35,200
Yes!

4081
03:28:37,180 --> 03:28:38,240
I need you in the corner!

4082
03:28:39,180 --> 03:28:40,160
That's right!

4083
03:28:41,120 --> 03:28:42,080
That's right!

4084
03:28:44,180 --> 03:28:44,840
Okay.

4085
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:47,280
He's stuck.

4086
03:28:48,340 --> 03:28:49,280
This is it!

4087
03:28:49,760 --> 03:28:50,700
This is it!

4088
03:28:50,720 --> 03:28:51,580
He can't get out!

4089
03:28:52,200 --> 03:28:53,120
I did it!

4090
03:28:53,560 --> 03:28:54,680
I locked it in!

4091
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:56,640
I winched it!

4092
03:28:57,180 --> 03:28:58,380
This is it!

4093
03:28:59,620 --> 03:29:01,600
You can't get out now!

4094
03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:04,300
I did it!

4095
03:29:05,360 --> 03:29:06,100
That's...

4096
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:08,300
How are you alive?!

4097
03:29:09,520 --> 03:29:10,460
That's right!

4098
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:12,680
One more for the ride!

4099
03:29:13,420 --> 03:29:14,180
There we go.

4100
03:29:14,520 --> 03:29:15,600
It's just that easy.

4101
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:18,740
This is where you die!

4102
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:31,680
I'm a fucking genius, guys.

4103
03:29:33,360 --> 03:29:33,900
Alright.

4104
03:29:34,160 --> 03:29:34,480
Nice.

4105
03:29:35,280 --> 03:29:36,120
We did it, guys.

4106
03:29:36,220 --> 03:29:36,980
That's all you have to do.

4107
03:29:37,060 --> 03:29:38,000
Just lock him in.

4108
03:29:38,240 --> 03:29:40,000
Just lock him in.

4109
03:29:41,800 --> 03:29:42,340
Alright.

4110
03:29:43,420 --> 03:29:44,520
I did it.

4111
03:29:44,700 --> 03:29:45,520
I killed Bart.

4112
03:29:46,180 --> 03:29:46,860
He was...

4113
03:29:48,280 --> 03:29:50,100
That was the plan, right?

4114
03:29:56,880 --> 03:29:57,620
Wait, what?

4115
03:29:58,100 --> 03:29:58,720
What's the point?

4116
03:30:00,640 --> 03:30:01,080
What?

4117
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:02,860
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

4118
03:30:04,500 --> 03:30:06,780
Wait, Bart the sea spanker?

4119
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:09,080
Okay, before we do, I need to rob Krusty.

4120
03:30:13,260 --> 03:30:13,700
Alright.

4121
03:30:13,980 --> 03:30:18,320
Before we do all of that, I need to rob Krusty so I can afford my new outfit.

4122
03:30:22,700 --> 03:30:23,660
I'll be right back.

4123
03:30:23,760 --> 03:30:23,940
Oh.

4124
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:24,780
Task complete?

4125
03:30:26,940 --> 03:30:27,380
Alright.

4126
03:30:27,580 --> 03:30:28,500
I'll be right back.

4127
03:30:29,940 --> 03:30:30,940
Krusty's over there.

4128
03:30:31,160 --> 03:30:32,020
God damn it!

4129
03:30:32,080 --> 03:30:33,000
Not the time!

4130
03:30:33,760 --> 03:30:35,920
It's always the time.

4131
03:30:36,560 --> 03:30:36,880
Alright.

4132
03:30:37,100 --> 03:30:37,480
Don't worry.

4133
03:30:37,560 --> 03:30:38,260
I'm heading over.

4134
03:30:39,780 --> 03:30:41,120
I'll head over.

4135
03:30:41,720 --> 03:30:42,300
Wait.

4136
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:43,340
Wait, no.

4137
03:30:43,420 --> 03:30:44,320
I have to go that way.

4138
03:30:44,460 --> 03:30:44,940
Oh my god.

4139
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:45,720
I fucked up.

4140
03:30:49,180 --> 03:30:49,780
I...

4141
03:30:49,780 --> 03:30:50,600
Whoops.

4142
03:30:51,320 --> 03:30:51,760
Alright.

4143
03:30:53,460 --> 03:30:56,060
Now I'm heading over for real.

4144
03:30:57,080 --> 03:30:58,580
Wait, how do I get over there?

4145
03:31:02,290 --> 03:31:03,590
How do I...

4146
03:31:04,190 --> 03:31:05,670
How do I get over there?

4147
03:31:06,010 --> 03:31:06,330
Hello?

4148
03:31:10,140 --> 03:31:12,760
How do I... Oh, I have to jump over?

4149
03:31:13,960 --> 03:31:15,300
I was so confused.

4150
03:31:15,440 --> 03:31:16,360
I was like, how?

4151
03:31:18,140 --> 03:31:19,260
Alright, it's this way.

4152
03:31:21,960 --> 03:31:23,180
Okay, I got this.

4153
03:31:24,580 --> 03:31:25,060
Alright.

4154
03:31:26,880 --> 03:31:28,060
I'm jumping over.

4155
03:31:30,460 --> 03:31:33,380
I'm gonna do something that no one has done before.

4156
03:31:41,940 --> 03:31:43,880
Let me try that again.

4157
03:31:44,320 --> 03:31:45,340
Let me...

4158
03:31:45,340 --> 03:31:47,400
I just didn't have enough speed.

4159
03:31:47,580 --> 03:31:47,760
Okay.

4160
03:31:48,760 --> 03:31:49,840
Nailed it.

4161
03:31:50,240 --> 03:31:50,540
Alright.

4162
03:31:50,740 --> 03:31:51,440
Watch this.

4163
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:52,900
Alright.

4164
03:31:53,080 --> 03:31:55,020
Now I have the speed.

4165
03:31:56,280 --> 03:31:57,620
I should have the speed now.

4166
03:31:57,780 --> 03:31:58,040
Woo!

4167
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:00,220
There we go.

4168
03:32:00,220 --> 03:32:01,280
Alright.

4169
03:32:02,180 --> 03:32:02,680
Am I in?

4170
03:32:10,220 --> 03:32:10,820
Okay.

4171
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:17,060
Okay, but like, it did look cool though.

4172
03:32:17,480 --> 03:32:18,120
Did it not?

4173
03:32:19,080 --> 03:32:20,980
Guys, did it not look cool?

4174
03:32:21,260 --> 03:32:22,740
It looked so cool.

4175
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:31,580
But it looked so cool.

4176
03:32:31,640 --> 03:32:32,620
I have to do this again?

4177
03:32:37,260 --> 03:32:37,540
No!

4178
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:48,280
If I do it...

4179
03:32:48,280 --> 03:32:49,500
I need to use the bathroom.

4180
03:32:49,860 --> 03:32:50,820
I'll be right back.

4181
03:35:30,830 --> 03:35:34,670
Guys, if I had known that...

4182
03:35:35,410 --> 03:35:45,150
I fucked it up, which means I restarted the entire thing, I might not have done what I've done.

4183
03:35:45,690 --> 03:35:52,710
I might not have done what I did today.

4184
03:35:53,230 --> 03:35:54,110
If I knew.

4185
03:35:54,110 --> 03:35:55,110
If I...

4186
03:35:57,990 --> 03:35:59,870
Alright, yes.

4187
03:36:00,590 --> 03:36:07,730
Alright, if I knew my actions had consequences, I wouldn't fuck around and found out.

4188
03:36:13,130 --> 03:36:15,370
I'm so sad.

4189
03:36:16,090 --> 03:36:21,110
It was so smart to what I did to that stupid nipple.

4190
03:36:24,470 --> 03:36:25,910
Oh my god.

4191
03:36:25,930 --> 03:36:27,550
I don't know if I can do it again.

4192
03:36:27,910 --> 03:36:30,270
It was like a one in a lifetime opportunity.

4193
03:36:31,010 --> 03:36:32,070
No, I can't!

4194
03:36:34,350 --> 03:36:37,370
I can't lock him in like I did.

4195
03:36:38,930 --> 03:36:39,430
Please.

4196
03:36:42,590 --> 03:36:44,970
Actions have consequences.

4197
03:36:46,270 --> 03:36:47,570
Since when?

4198
03:36:50,910 --> 03:36:52,930
When was that last thing?

4199
03:36:54,530 --> 03:36:55,330
Shit.

4200
03:36:59,290 --> 03:37:01,370
What do you mean?

4201
03:37:02,710 --> 03:37:03,650
What do you mean?

4202
03:37:04,130 --> 03:37:04,850
Crash into me.

4203
03:37:05,350 --> 03:37:06,090
Crash into me.

4204
03:37:06,630 --> 03:37:07,330
That's right.

4205
03:37:07,770 --> 03:37:08,510
Keep crashing.

4206
03:37:08,930 --> 03:37:10,010
That's right.

4207
03:37:12,970 --> 03:37:14,010
That's right.

4208
03:37:20,750 --> 03:37:22,190
That's right.

4209
03:37:22,470 --> 03:37:23,090
That's right.

4210
03:37:23,090 --> 03:37:24,010
I don't care.

4211
03:37:24,490 --> 03:37:25,890
This is crap.

4212
03:37:27,610 --> 03:37:29,270
The slow game.

4213
03:37:29,730 --> 03:37:31,610
The slow game.

4214
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:39,210
Like, what is this?

4215
03:37:39,670 --> 03:37:41,290
You showed up.

4216
03:37:41,950 --> 03:37:43,070
She's lost.

4217
03:37:43,550 --> 03:37:45,250
Guys, maybe this is not the right car.

4218
03:37:45,570 --> 03:37:46,970
I'll get another car.

4219
03:37:47,530 --> 03:37:49,370
Mr. Plow, it's time to bring it.

4220
03:37:49,450 --> 03:37:50,330
No, I keep getting hit!

4221
03:37:50,390 --> 03:37:50,890
Don't get in!

4222
03:37:50,990 --> 03:37:51,550
Don't get in!

4223
03:37:53,450 --> 03:37:56,250
It's time to bring in Mr. Plow.

4224
03:37:56,610 --> 03:37:59,750
I'm ready to call in the big boys.

4225
03:38:00,570 --> 03:38:00,990
Alright.

4226
03:38:02,850 --> 03:38:04,270
Where's Mr. Plow?

4227
03:38:05,010 --> 03:38:06,250
Mr. Plow.

4228
03:38:07,510 --> 03:38:08,370
It's time.

4229
03:38:12,410 --> 03:38:13,290
It's time.

4230
03:38:13,410 --> 03:38:14,910
I brought the Plow King instead.

4231
03:38:17,130 --> 03:38:18,350
Same thing.

4232
03:38:18,710 --> 03:38:19,830
Same business.

4233
03:38:20,930 --> 03:38:22,290
That limo bet.

4234
03:38:22,350 --> 03:38:23,750
I'm gonna plow him down.

4235
03:38:24,330 --> 03:38:26,430
Are you ready for a plowing?

4236
03:38:27,990 --> 03:38:28,630
Boom!

4237
03:38:28,910 --> 03:38:30,230
Okay, I missed.

4238
03:38:30,410 --> 03:38:30,670
Okay.

4239
03:38:30,990 --> 03:38:31,690
That's okay.

4240
03:38:34,190 --> 03:38:35,350
That's okay, slow.

4241
03:38:35,970 --> 03:38:36,890
That's okay.

4242
03:38:36,890 --> 03:38:36,990
That's okay.

4243
03:38:38,310 --> 03:38:39,230
There we go.

4244
03:38:39,970 --> 03:38:41,830
God damn it, he drove out of it.

4245
03:38:43,170 --> 03:38:47,250
I'm gonna give him the limo back shots that he was never prepared for.

4246
03:38:47,930 --> 03:38:49,830
Oh my god, no, the cops want me too.

4247
03:38:50,250 --> 03:38:52,830
Please, I just... Please, I've been through a lot.

4248
03:38:53,410 --> 03:38:54,890
I should get like...

4249
03:38:55,670 --> 03:39:00,110
I should get like a little plus one forgiveness.

4250
03:39:00,970 --> 03:39:02,890
Alright, he should be driving this way, right?

4251
03:39:12,260 --> 03:39:15,870
I just...

4252
03:39:15,870 --> 03:39:15,970
I just...

4253
03:39:15,970 --> 03:39:18,070
It was a 50-50.

4254
03:39:18,510 --> 03:39:21,470
It was a 50-50, guys.

4255
03:39:21,570 --> 03:39:23,910
I lost a 50-50.

4256
03:39:24,530 --> 03:39:27,530
I lost a 50-50.

4257
03:39:28,210 --> 03:39:31,870
How was I supposed to know?

4258
03:39:32,450 --> 03:39:34,230
How was I...

4259
03:39:34,230 --> 03:39:36,490
Oh my god.

4260
03:39:36,710 --> 03:39:37,970
I'm so sad.

4261
03:39:37,970 --> 03:39:39,930
I'm so sad.

4262
03:39:41,090 --> 03:39:42,290
I'm so...

4263
03:39:42,290 --> 03:39:43,270
Well...

4264
03:39:43,270 --> 03:39:46,770
Okay, this is it.

4265
03:39:47,650 --> 03:39:49,430
I have missed the plow king.

4266
03:39:49,690 --> 03:39:52,170
And I still do zero damage on the plow.

4267
03:39:52,310 --> 03:39:53,950
Okay, that's fine.

4268
03:39:57,270 --> 03:39:58,130
It's fine.

4269
03:39:58,790 --> 03:39:59,650
It's fine.

4270
03:40:02,230 --> 03:40:03,130
It's fine.

4271
03:40:03,610 --> 03:40:04,990
It's not fine anymore.

4272
03:40:05,090 --> 03:40:05,670
He got out.

4273
03:40:05,670 --> 03:40:07,650
He got out of it.

4274
03:40:08,850 --> 03:40:10,130
Oh my god.

4275
03:40:10,170 --> 03:40:11,370
I have to do a U-turn.

4276
03:40:11,610 --> 03:40:12,550
It's not fine.

4277
03:40:12,690 --> 03:40:14,590
I gotta do U-turns.

4278
03:40:16,190 --> 03:40:21,170
I actually have to like sit... I'm sitting up closer to the monitor right now.

4279
03:40:21,330 --> 03:40:22,930
I'm not lounging anymore.

4280
03:40:24,830 --> 03:40:26,610
Oh my god.

4281
03:40:27,430 --> 03:40:30,970
Why are there so many people here in the board road?

4282
03:40:30,970 --> 03:40:32,470
Oh my god.

4283
03:40:34,730 --> 03:40:35,210
God!

4284
03:40:39,190 --> 03:40:42,470
Okay, I'm leaning in.

4285
03:40:42,550 --> 03:40:43,750
You know like those locked in?

4286
03:40:43,950 --> 03:40:45,770
When you're locked in and you lean in?

4287
03:40:45,870 --> 03:40:46,790
That's me right now.

4288
03:40:47,870 --> 03:40:50,150
Okay, I'm taking you over there.

4289
03:40:50,610 --> 03:40:52,130
I'm taking you over there.

4290
03:40:52,290 --> 03:40:53,570
You are not leaving.

4291
03:40:53,610 --> 03:40:54,950
I'm taking you over there.

4292
03:40:55,210 --> 03:40:56,730
I'm taking you over there.

4293
03:40:56,970 --> 03:40:59,930
You are... Oh, you were not supposed to get out.

4294
03:41:02,050 --> 03:41:02,930
Please!

4295
03:41:03,370 --> 03:41:05,770
I wish I...

4296
03:41:05,770 --> 03:41:22,990
If I do me fucking around because I have to restart this I wouldn't have fucked around to do this stupid level mission after the most insane gamer tech I've ever done.

4297
03:41:28,180 --> 03:41:29,400
Please explode!

4298
03:41:29,400 --> 03:41:30,020
EXPLODE!

4299
03:41:31,500 --> 03:41:33,380
Okay, there we go.

4300
03:41:33,740 --> 03:41:34,100
Okay.

4301
03:41:34,540 --> 03:41:35,460
Alright, guys.

4302
03:41:35,640 --> 03:41:40,960
Okay, before I talk to the sea captain, let's figure out how to get on the boat.

4303
03:41:41,360 --> 03:41:42,700
Let's figure it out.

4304
03:41:44,240 --> 03:41:45,300
He nailed it.

4305
03:41:47,020 --> 03:41:47,360
Okay.

4306
03:41:49,120 --> 03:41:49,400
Alright.

4307
03:41:52,240 --> 03:41:52,780
Oh, you're right.

4308
03:41:52,840 --> 03:41:53,320
I should save.

4309
03:41:54,020 --> 03:41:55,260
I'll make it across.

4310
03:41:56,700 --> 03:41:57,300
Weeeee.

4311
03:41:58,580 --> 03:42:00,660
I'm so sad.

4312
03:42:01,560 --> 03:42:03,680
I'm so sad.

4313
03:42:04,500 --> 03:42:06,680
How was that private property?

4314
03:42:06,980 --> 03:42:09,580
It was public property meant to be destroyed.

4315
03:42:10,740 --> 03:42:11,500
Okay.

4316
03:42:12,080 --> 03:42:12,620
It's okay.

4317
03:42:13,500 --> 03:42:14,560
It's okay.

4318
03:42:14,980 --> 03:42:17,800
I have time to not talk to him.

4319
03:42:19,460 --> 03:42:20,560
It's okay.

4320
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:23,300
I have time to not talk.

4321
03:42:27,090 --> 03:42:28,170
No, no, no.

4322
03:42:28,350 --> 03:42:28,850
He missed.

4323
03:42:29,210 --> 03:42:30,410
That's fucking right, idiot.

4324
03:42:31,250 --> 03:42:32,250
He missed.

4325
03:42:32,790 --> 03:42:33,870
Can't catch me.

4326
03:42:35,050 --> 03:42:35,870
Alright, nice.

4327
03:42:35,970 --> 03:42:36,990
Okay, let's figure this out.

4328
03:42:37,510 --> 03:42:37,810
Alright.

4329
03:42:38,590 --> 03:42:39,410
Alright, guys.

4330
03:42:40,950 --> 03:42:42,930
We have analysis right now.

4331
03:42:43,170 --> 03:42:45,030
How do we get up the ship?

4332
03:42:45,390 --> 03:42:46,570
I can't do this.

4333
03:42:46,670 --> 03:42:47,490
I can't be safe.

4334
03:42:47,850 --> 03:42:48,730
Oh shit, nice.

4335
03:42:51,590 --> 03:42:52,530
Oh my god.

4336
03:42:52,530 --> 03:42:53,410
I can't save.

4337
03:42:53,670 --> 03:42:53,890
Wait.

4338
03:42:54,430 --> 03:42:55,770
How did I do that?

4339
03:42:57,690 --> 03:42:58,950
I can't save.

4340
03:43:00,550 --> 03:43:02,170
The ram was correct.

4341
03:43:02,330 --> 03:43:04,130
Alright, we're gonna figure this out to get there.

4342
03:43:04,270 --> 03:43:07,650
Before we do anything, we gotta figure out how to get out of there.

4343
03:43:11,210 --> 03:43:13,430
Evan died laughing in a minute.

4344
03:43:13,570 --> 03:43:14,530
I almost passed out.

4345
03:43:14,670 --> 03:43:16,610
Jackson, thank you for the super chat.

4346
03:43:16,830 --> 03:43:17,190
Thank you.

4347
03:43:17,650 --> 03:43:19,210
Okay, we're not using that car.

4348
03:43:19,210 --> 03:43:20,890
We're not.

4349
03:43:22,330 --> 03:43:24,130
That car might not be it.

4350
03:43:24,610 --> 03:43:26,230
That car looks pretty rough.

4351
03:43:26,870 --> 03:43:29,230
Okay, let's get the sedan.

4352
03:43:30,070 --> 03:43:31,490
The perfect car.

4353
03:43:37,130 --> 03:43:37,850
Alright.

4354
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:40,090
Let's test run this.

4355
03:43:40,230 --> 03:43:42,590
We gotta test run this.

4356
03:43:43,630 --> 03:43:44,350
Alright.

4357
03:43:45,710 --> 03:43:47,490
We can do this with a sedan.

4358
03:43:47,490 --> 03:43:48,750
I believe.

4359
03:43:50,610 --> 03:43:51,170
Please.

4360
03:43:51,430 --> 03:43:51,730
No!

4361
03:43:52,150 --> 03:43:53,830
The car was too good!

4362
03:43:54,130 --> 03:43:56,430
It was too good of a car!

4363
03:43:57,410 --> 03:43:58,150
Go back.

4364
03:43:58,410 --> 03:43:59,730
Wait, I can do this on the lighthouse?

4365
03:44:01,230 --> 03:44:03,230
Alright, how do we do this on the lighthouse?

4366
03:44:04,450 --> 03:44:06,670
The car was actually too good.

4367
03:44:08,690 --> 03:44:09,110
Alright.

4368
03:44:09,510 --> 03:44:12,050
Wait, we can do this with the lighthouse?

4369
03:44:13,110 --> 03:44:13,410
Alright.

4370
03:44:14,350 --> 03:44:16,030
Kowalski analysis now.

4371
03:44:18,370 --> 03:44:19,530
Wait, I can do this.

4372
03:44:19,610 --> 03:44:20,450
I can make the jump.

4373
03:44:23,170 --> 03:44:24,450
I can do this.

4374
03:44:28,670 --> 03:44:29,890
Oh my god!

4375
03:44:30,310 --> 03:44:31,010
Oh my god!

4376
03:44:31,190 --> 03:44:32,830
We did it!

4377
03:44:33,130 --> 03:44:33,670
Alright.

4378
03:44:34,850 --> 03:44:36,070
We did it.

4379
03:44:36,590 --> 03:44:39,270
Alright, we figured it out.

4380
03:44:40,150 --> 03:44:41,470
Alright, nice.

4381
03:44:42,790 --> 03:44:43,670
How do I get out?

4382
03:44:43,670 --> 03:44:45,050
Oh wait, hey.

4383
03:44:45,290 --> 03:44:46,250
I need this.

4384
03:44:47,130 --> 03:44:47,910
Okay, nice.

4385
03:44:49,290 --> 03:44:50,470
Oh my god.

4386
03:44:50,790 --> 03:44:52,570
I think I can afford Florida.

4387
03:44:53,070 --> 03:44:56,170
I think it was $200, right?

4388
03:44:56,750 --> 03:44:57,230
Was it $200?

4389
03:44:57,570 --> 03:44:58,670
It doesn't matter, I have $250.

4390
03:45:01,970 --> 03:45:03,890
Wait, the secret car is up there?

4391
03:45:04,210 --> 03:45:05,470
How do I get the secret car?

4392
03:45:06,330 --> 03:45:06,970
It's up here?

4393
03:45:12,820 --> 03:45:13,900
How do I get it?

4394
03:45:15,680 --> 03:45:16,240
Oh my god.

4395
03:45:16,300 --> 03:45:17,020
I don't know how.

4396
03:45:18,200 --> 03:45:19,280
Where's the secret car?

4397
03:45:21,700 --> 03:45:23,320
Oh, it's in the shipping container?

4398
03:45:23,500 --> 03:45:23,720
Okay.

4399
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:25,800
Okay, it's in one of these containers.

4400
03:45:25,980 --> 03:45:27,540
Okay, don't worry, I'm exploring now.

4401
03:45:28,280 --> 03:45:29,300
I made it.

4402
03:45:33,160 --> 03:45:35,200
Wait, what secret car is it?

4403
03:45:37,420 --> 03:45:38,480
Oh, it's in this one?

4404
03:45:41,580 --> 03:45:42,840
Oh, I can't get up there.

4405
03:45:44,200 --> 03:45:44,700
Okay.

4406
03:45:44,700 --> 03:45:45,020
Green one?

4407
03:45:45,100 --> 03:45:45,960
Oh, this one!

4408
03:45:46,040 --> 03:45:47,340
Okay, I can jump these boxes.

4409
03:45:48,460 --> 03:45:49,260
Alright, parkour!

4410
03:45:50,060 --> 03:45:50,560
Parkour!

4411
03:45:52,460 --> 03:45:53,180
Don't worry.

4412
03:45:53,940 --> 03:45:54,760
I can parkour.

4413
03:45:56,600 --> 03:45:57,000
Yay!

4414
03:45:57,240 --> 03:45:58,020
Wait, what's this?

4415
03:46:00,680 --> 03:46:02,140
What reference is this one?

4416
03:46:02,360 --> 03:46:04,640
Oh shit, look at my cool ass car though.

4417
03:46:05,160 --> 03:46:07,040
I have no idea what car this is.

4418
03:46:07,960 --> 03:46:09,740
I don't know what reference this is.

4419
03:46:10,220 --> 03:46:11,360
The boat car?

4420
03:46:12,260 --> 03:46:14,600
I don't remember what episode this is from.

4421
03:46:14,920 --> 03:46:16,080
Oh shit, hot pants!

4422
03:46:16,160 --> 03:46:16,740
I know that.

4423
03:46:17,740 --> 03:46:18,920
The boat mobile.

4424
03:46:20,360 --> 03:46:22,220
Alright guys, I figured it out.

4425
03:46:24,700 --> 03:46:25,160
Okay.

4426
03:46:25,580 --> 03:46:26,420
Do I keep it?

4427
03:46:26,460 --> 03:46:27,540
I must have kept it, right?

4428
03:46:28,320 --> 03:46:29,440
Alright, I need to get this though.

4429
03:46:31,040 --> 03:46:31,400
Boop!

4430
03:46:32,360 --> 03:46:33,060
Get over here.

4431
03:46:33,460 --> 03:46:34,160
I need that money.

4432
03:46:36,500 --> 03:46:37,960
Oh my god, I did it.

4433
03:46:37,960 --> 03:46:38,640
I'm in.

4434
03:46:39,520 --> 03:46:40,400
I'm in.

4435
03:46:41,380 --> 03:46:43,160
And I got my hot pants too.

4436
03:46:43,800 --> 03:46:44,560
I'm in.

4437
03:46:45,880 --> 03:46:49,500
I got my hot pants and I got my boat mobile.

4438
03:46:53,340 --> 03:46:53,840
Alright.

4439
03:46:54,860 --> 03:46:56,680
I accidentally reset my car, but that's okay.

4440
03:46:57,380 --> 03:47:02,540
Alright, now that I got all I need, it's time to do something very important.

4441
03:47:03,600 --> 03:47:05,240
It's time to buy Florida.

4442
03:47:05,240 --> 03:47:05,400
Florida.

4443
03:47:08,740 --> 03:47:11,320
This was the entire purpose of this game.

4444
03:47:12,280 --> 03:47:12,760
Alright.

4445
03:47:13,540 --> 03:47:15,340
Where's the closest clothing store?

4446
03:47:15,440 --> 03:47:15,840
Guys.

4447
03:47:18,040 --> 03:47:19,520
I gotta go back up.

4448
03:47:20,460 --> 03:47:21,240
That's fine.

4449
03:47:21,800 --> 03:47:23,140
I can't save, guys.

4450
03:47:23,220 --> 03:47:24,520
It won't let me save.

4451
03:47:25,300 --> 03:47:28,600
It won't let me save when I'm in the middle of a mission.

4452
03:47:31,140 --> 03:47:32,340
Stupid Flanders.

4453
03:47:32,340 --> 03:47:35,280
This is all- I know this is all Flanders' fault.

4454
03:47:36,560 --> 03:47:38,240
It's alright, I have my boat mobile.

4455
03:47:40,820 --> 03:47:42,500
Alright, I have enough money now.

4456
03:47:43,020 --> 03:47:48,160
Guys, all I'm saying is that I haven't got arrested by the cops in like a long- in like at least an hour.

4457
03:47:48,760 --> 03:47:50,040
So like, I'm doing something right.

4458
03:47:51,980 --> 03:47:52,320
Alright.

4459
03:47:53,160 --> 03:47:53,560
Woooo!

4460
03:47:56,990 --> 03:47:57,390
Alright.

4461
03:47:59,150 --> 03:48:00,170
Oh my god, okay.

4462
03:48:00,470 --> 03:48:01,750
It's okay, I'm next to the comic book store.

4463
03:48:01,750 --> 03:48:03,090
I can't get arrested.

4464
03:48:04,690 --> 03:48:05,370
Alright.

4465
03:48:07,630 --> 03:48:10,250
I am ready to own Flo-

4466
03:48:13,970 --> 03:48:18,850
Where's the- I have to complete the mission to be able to buy clothes?

4467
03:48:19,370 --> 03:48:19,770
I-

4468
03:48:23,350 --> 03:48:28,770
Are you fucking- Okay, I guess I'm not ready to own Florida.

4469
03:48:28,770 --> 03:48:29,150
Yes!

4470
03:48:30,710 --> 03:48:33,110
How was I supposed to know that?

4471
03:48:34,330 --> 03:48:36,970
Alright, back to- back to the captain.

4472
03:48:37,590 --> 03:48:45,110
Back- I wanted to fucking- Oh my god, I thought I could drive through that.

4473
03:48:45,890 --> 03:48:48,390
I didn't know you could buy clothes in the middle of a mission!

4474
03:48:48,810 --> 03:48:50,330
What if I want to look different?

4475
03:48:50,490 --> 03:48:52,590
I could change cars in the middle of a mission!

4476
03:48:53,110 --> 03:48:54,630
Why can't I buy clothes?

4477
03:48:57,350 --> 03:48:59,150
Oh no, I'm not gonna make it, it's fine.

4478
03:48:59,430 --> 03:49:00,390
Oh, it's not fine.

4479
03:49:00,630 --> 03:49:02,210
It's not fine.

4480
03:49:04,770 --> 03:49:06,390
Oh my god.

4481
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:11,300
Alright, here we go.

4482
03:49:11,500 --> 03:49:13,440
It's okay, I can do it after this mission.

4483
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:15,320
It'll be fine.

4484
03:49:16,580 --> 03:49:19,060
I'll just- I'll just buy it after the mission.

4485
03:49:19,440 --> 03:49:20,420
And then it'll be fine.

4486
03:49:21,420 --> 03:49:22,740
I- I'm patient enough.

4487
03:49:23,240 --> 03:49:24,080
I'm patient.

4488
03:49:24,080 --> 03:49:24,300
I'm patient.

4489
03:49:26,740 --> 03:49:27,180
Hello.

4490
03:49:29,760 --> 03:49:30,120
Alright.

4491
03:49:33,400 --> 03:49:34,860
It's fine, my car is okay.

4492
03:49:34,980 --> 03:49:37,080
I just need to go to the lighthouse and then do the jump.

4493
03:49:39,640 --> 03:49:41,500
It's fine, I have plenty of time.

4494
03:49:44,240 --> 03:49:44,460
Alright.

4495
03:49:46,120 --> 03:49:47,780
It's fine, we have the strat.

4496
03:49:50,600 --> 03:49:51,920
Right here.

4497
03:49:55,720 --> 03:49:57,440
I'm gonna make it!

4498
03:50:01,280 --> 03:50:02,160
Nice.

4499
03:50:08,860 --> 03:50:09,740
Nice.

4500
03:50:10,580 --> 03:50:11,860
I made it.

4501
03:50:15,580 --> 03:50:16,920
Alright, Bart, I'm here now.

4502
03:50:17,920 --> 03:50:18,860
Where's Bart?

4503
03:50:20,260 --> 03:50:21,000
Where is he?

4504
03:50:23,240 --> 03:50:23,720
Hello?

4505
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:25,820
Bart, where are you?

4506
03:50:25,880 --> 03:50:26,400
Oh, there you are.

4507
03:50:26,480 --> 03:50:26,880
Hey, Bart!

4508
03:50:30,660 --> 03:50:31,140
Huh?

4509
03:50:31,820 --> 03:50:32,480
You okay?

4510
03:50:50,940 --> 03:50:52,200
Kiss my grit?

4511
03:51:00,380 --> 03:51:01,840
Yay, I did it!

4512
03:51:01,840 --> 03:51:03,180
I found Bart!

4513
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:04,020
Huh?

4514
03:51:12,840 --> 03:51:13,640
Huh?

4515
03:51:18,940 --> 03:51:20,460
Wait, what do you mean?

4516
03:51:21,480 --> 03:51:25,160
What do you mean level 3 is so big?

4517
03:51:27,040 --> 03:51:27,440
Huh?

4518
03:51:28,080 --> 03:51:29,240
Why am I Marge?

4519
03:51:29,720 --> 03:51:32,020
Why am I- Why am I Marge?

4520
03:51:33,120 --> 03:51:35,600
Why am I Marge?

4521
03:51:39,000 --> 03:51:39,560
But...

4522
03:51:41,880 --> 03:51:42,440
But...

4523
03:51:42,440 --> 03:51:44,300
I just won one thing.

4524
03:51:47,340 --> 03:51:48,360
There's no way.

4525
03:51:48,520 --> 03:51:50,120
Oh my god, I'm going back.

4526
03:51:50,760 --> 03:51:52,740
You can't take this away from me.

4527
03:51:53,080 --> 03:51:56,940
You can't- You can't take this away from me!

4528
03:51:56,940 --> 03:51:57,180
I did it!

4529
03:52:00,530 --> 03:52:01,400
I refuse!

4530
03:52:04,520 --> 03:52:06,800
I'm coming back!

4531
03:52:08,630 --> 03:52:10,420
I refuse to leave!

4532
03:52:12,700 --> 03:52:15,980
You can't take this from me!

4533
03:52:16,620 --> 03:52:17,640
I got my car.

4534
03:52:19,200 --> 03:52:21,820
Do you know how much I sacrificed?

4535
03:52:22,120 --> 03:52:23,080
I'm coming over.

4536
03:52:23,080 --> 03:52:25,180
I'm coming over.

4537
03:52:27,440 --> 03:52:30,460
I saved all my earnings for this.

4538
03:52:31,640 --> 03:52:34,680
I almost had enough and then they made me buy a bus.

4539
03:52:35,080 --> 03:52:39,260
And then I almost had enough again and then they made me buy cool clothes.

4540
03:52:39,900 --> 03:52:41,720
You can't take this away.

4541
03:52:43,680 --> 03:52:45,520
I earned this.

4542
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:49,540
My entire life savings was spent on this.

4543
03:52:51,140 --> 03:52:51,660
Alright.

4544
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:53,660
It's fine.

4545
03:52:53,840 --> 03:52:57,080
I can run over two more people before the cops will notice.

4546
03:52:59,060 --> 03:52:59,580
Alright.

4547
03:52:59,800 --> 03:53:00,780
This is my reward.

4548
03:53:01,600 --> 03:53:02,020
There you go.

4549
03:53:02,040 --> 03:53:02,300
See?

4550
03:53:03,200 --> 03:53:03,720
One.

4551
03:53:04,480 --> 03:53:07,500
I told you I can run over two more people before they notice.

4552
03:53:09,440 --> 03:53:10,360
This is it.

4553
03:53:10,760 --> 03:53:11,800
This is my reward.

4554
03:53:12,440 --> 03:53:14,140
This is my fucking reward.

4555
03:53:14,300 --> 03:53:14,920
I don't care.

4556
03:53:18,040 --> 03:53:19,500
This is it.

4557
03:53:19,580 --> 03:53:21,220
Oh my god.

4558
03:53:22,000 --> 03:53:23,760
This is it.

4559
03:53:23,840 --> 03:53:25,600
I'm beautiful.

4560
03:53:27,040 --> 03:53:28,360
Let's go.

4561
03:53:31,300 --> 03:53:35,920
You know how much I sacrificed to be Florida.

4562
03:53:39,380 --> 03:53:41,400
Finally, I'm beautiful.

4563
03:53:41,580 --> 03:53:43,300
I'm so beautiful, yes.

4564
03:53:43,300 --> 03:53:43,440
Yes.

4565
03:53:44,840 --> 03:53:45,860
Stop the car.

4566
03:53:47,800 --> 03:53:49,860
I wanna be beautiful on top.

4567
03:53:52,420 --> 03:53:55,360
I wanna be beautiful on top of the car.

4568
03:53:56,180 --> 03:53:57,020
It's a parade.

4569
03:53:58,240 --> 03:53:59,100
Guys, clap.

4570
03:53:59,320 --> 03:54:00,260
Wave your hands.

4571
03:54:00,380 --> 03:54:01,640
I'm on a parade right now.

4572
03:54:01,720 --> 03:54:02,840
Wave your hands.

4573
03:54:02,940 --> 03:54:04,460
Oh wait, my car's in the middle of the street.

4574
03:54:09,620 --> 03:54:10,500
Oh no.

4575
03:54:10,620 --> 03:54:12,200
My car's in the middle of the street.

4576
03:54:12,660 --> 03:54:14,720
Alright, let me move the car real quick, guys.

4577
03:54:15,380 --> 03:54:16,200
Let me move the car.

4578
03:54:17,620 --> 03:54:19,400
The parade stopped for a little bit.

4579
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:20,300
No, no, no, no, no.

4580
03:54:20,320 --> 03:54:20,700
You're not.

4581
03:54:21,180 --> 03:54:21,600
Get away.

4582
03:54:21,900 --> 03:54:22,340
No!

4583
03:54:22,580 --> 03:54:23,280
My parade!

4584
03:54:24,140 --> 03:54:24,860
It's okay.

4585
03:54:25,500 --> 03:54:26,160
It's alright.

4586
03:54:26,340 --> 03:54:27,340
I have another car.

4587
03:54:28,920 --> 03:54:30,080
Wave your hands.

4588
03:54:31,140 --> 03:54:32,840
Wave your hands, everybody.

4589
03:54:34,240 --> 03:54:35,660
It's a doki parade.

4590
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:38,060
It's a doki parade.

4591
03:54:38,060 --> 03:54:43,720
And here to represent Florida is me, the most beautiful person in this parade.

4592
03:54:44,460 --> 03:54:48,440
Wave your hands, everybody.

4593
03:54:49,160 --> 03:54:50,620
Wave your hands.

4594
03:54:53,680 --> 03:54:55,240
Wave to the...

4595
03:54:55,240 --> 03:54:56,300
Blow them kisses.

4596
03:54:56,600 --> 03:54:57,660
I'll blow...

4597
03:54:57,660 --> 03:54:59,260
No!

4598
03:55:01,360 --> 03:55:02,000
No!

4599
03:55:02,460 --> 03:55:03,420
Get back here!

4600
03:55:03,420 --> 03:55:04,160
My float!

4601
03:55:04,960 --> 03:55:06,000
My float.

4602
03:55:06,940 --> 03:55:07,920
My float.

4603
03:55:08,460 --> 03:55:08,900
It's okay.

4604
03:55:09,880 --> 03:55:11,220
It's okay, I'll get another one.

4605
03:55:11,880 --> 03:55:13,300
I shall kidnap another car.

4606
03:55:13,700 --> 03:55:14,280
It's okay.

4607
03:55:15,260 --> 03:55:16,720
I will still be beautiful.

4608
03:55:19,580 --> 03:55:20,720
Hey, Choa.

4609
03:55:21,040 --> 03:55:22,260
Thank you for the superchat.

4610
03:55:22,400 --> 03:55:23,380
Thank you, thank you.

4611
03:55:23,820 --> 03:55:25,040
Behold, Florida.

4612
03:55:25,220 --> 03:55:27,440
Nick, like the grandchild of Gamlord.

4613
03:55:27,680 --> 03:55:29,100
Thank you for the superchat.

4614
03:55:29,220 --> 03:55:30,180
Thank you, thank you.

4615
03:55:30,180 --> 03:55:32,320
Duck, thank you for the superchat.

4616
03:55:32,380 --> 03:55:33,500
Thank you, thank you.

4617
03:55:33,860 --> 03:55:37,760
Mistoki bird, what is your first act as governor of Florida?

4618
03:55:39,320 --> 03:55:41,160
Thank you for the superchat.

4619
03:55:41,360 --> 03:55:42,420
Thank you, thank you.

4620
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:54,540
My first decree as governor of Florida is that is that there's no more bedtime.

4621
03:55:54,980 --> 03:55:57,280
No more bedtime.

4622
03:55:57,280 --> 03:56:00,360
If I see you sleep in Florida, it's over.

4623
03:56:00,480 --> 03:56:01,240
You get deported.

4624
03:56:01,820 --> 03:56:06,000
You get...

4625
03:56:06,000 --> 03:56:08,880
You get deported to Wisconsin.

4626
03:56:12,980 --> 03:56:14,640
No more sleep.

4627
03:56:16,400 --> 03:56:17,580
That's my queen.

4628
03:56:17,760 --> 03:56:19,720
The national end of bedtime.

4629
03:56:22,940 --> 03:56:23,820
No more

4630
03:56:28,250 --> 03:56:28,690
bedtime.

4631
03:56:29,230 --> 03:56:29,670
Wisconsin?

4632
03:56:32,150 --> 03:56:32,790
I don't know.

4633
03:56:33,290 --> 03:56:37,250
This feels like a good state to feel like a good place to deport to.

4634
03:56:38,050 --> 03:56:40,270
Please, Dookie, I haven't slept in 10 days.

4635
03:56:40,450 --> 03:56:41,970
I need to sleep.

4636
03:56:42,270 --> 03:56:43,110
Not in Florida!

4637
03:56:44,230 --> 03:56:45,830
Don't make me send you to Detroit!

4638
03:56:46,030 --> 03:56:47,830
I could send you to Detroit instead!

4639
03:56:50,030 --> 03:56:50,630
Alright.

4640
03:56:50,950 --> 03:56:51,390
Yeah.

4641
03:56:57,190 --> 03:56:58,090
Not Detroit.

4642
03:56:59,230 --> 03:57:00,290
Alright, guys.

4643
03:57:00,390 --> 03:57:01,410
I'm gonna call it here.

4644
03:57:01,550 --> 03:57:03,090
We are not finishing this game today.

4645
03:57:03,190 --> 03:57:04,230
I'm fucking tired.

4646
03:57:04,650 --> 03:57:05,830
I'm tired.

4647
03:57:08,390 --> 03:57:11,430
My mission was to get Florida and I got Florida.

4648
03:57:11,910 --> 03:57:14,450
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

4649
03:57:14,970 --> 03:57:18,550
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture check.

4650
03:57:18,850 --> 03:57:21,150
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4651
03:57:21,390 --> 03:57:22,410
Have you slept for me?

4652
03:57:22,590 --> 03:57:24,910
Head to bed, cause you deserve it.

4653
03:57:25,190 --> 03:57:26,750
Let me save my game real quick.

4654
03:57:27,090 --> 03:57:28,210
That was a fun game!

4655
03:57:28,750 --> 03:57:30,250
I can't believe it gets harder.

4656
03:57:30,870 --> 03:57:35,030
I can't believe this game is gonna get even harder.

4657
03:57:35,510 --> 03:57:36,330
But we'll see.

4658
03:57:36,490 --> 03:57:36,970
We'll try.

4659
03:57:37,270 --> 03:57:38,970
Maybe we'll finish it next time.

4660
03:57:39,090 --> 03:57:40,650
We'll finish it in the second week.

4661
03:57:41,410 --> 03:57:43,230
And I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4662
03:57:43,470 --> 03:57:44,610
Bye, guys.

4663
03:57:44,610 --> 03:57:45,590
Bye!
