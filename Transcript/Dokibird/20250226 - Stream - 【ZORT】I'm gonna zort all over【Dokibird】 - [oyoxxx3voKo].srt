1
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,180
...putting it on my YouTube channel.

2
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Because usually it's never on YouTube, it's on like, Twitch, but I have to do it for like...

3
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,200
Uh, so like, you guys, okay, so I'm just gonna tell it to my chat now and tell you guys.

4
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,220
So I got like, sponsored by MSI to do a Monster Hunter Wilds launch stream.

5
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,740
And they gave me codes to give away to chat.

6
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,720
And I was supposed to give out some codes today.

7
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,700
So then they were like, oh, you have to do a giveaway.

8
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,320
And then my manager was like, use Nightbot for it.

9
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,840
I was like, I've never done it on YouTube before.

10
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,240
So I was testing it out for today's stream.

11
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,500
And the moment it went live, Nightbot literally deleted my entire chat for spamming it.

12
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,800
Oh, it did that for me too!

13
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,960
During the, what's it called?

14
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,440
The Minecraft tournament thing.

15
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,140
Oh my god!

17
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,980
Guys, I made, hold on, I made the lobby, but it won't let me invite you guys.

18
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,700
Oh, we have to be public!

19
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,000
No, no, like in the game, like it says invite friends, but it won't let me click on it.

20
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,100
Okay, let's take a look.

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,580
Hold on.

22
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,140
I'm also gonna frame rate cap this game because I bet you it's coded spectacularly and it's gonna break something if I don't do that.

23
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,600
I know, I loaded this game up.

24
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,760
It loaded in full resolution, ultra high extreme graphics.

25
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,980
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:37,700
I can't wait to Zort in like full ultra HD, guys.

27
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm so excited to Zort all over.

28
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,620
I've never heard anybody refer to this graphic level as ultra mega, but that's what it's called.

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,080
Ultra mega, it's even better than ultra.

30
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,560
That's crazy.

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,060
I should tone her down too.

32
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,740
I should tone that down too.

33
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,960
Yeah, it's like, hey, would you like to run this game at ultra settings 4k?

34
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,760
240 frames per second.

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,940
And I'm like, no, I'm good.

36
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm good.

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,180
I was actually, I actually put it on ultra mega because I was, I was, you know, I'm gonna keep it ultra mega.

38
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm curious.

39
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
I'm curious on how that's gonna go.

40
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,380
I'll keep it on ultra mega, but I'm gonna cap the shit out of the frame rate.

41
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,590
All right.

42
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,030
That's weird.

43
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,490
I won't let you invite people.

44
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,010
Did you figure it out yet?

45
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,250
Me?

46
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,850
Yeah.

47
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,510
No, it's like, here, I can show you like.

48
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,990
There is a lobby.

49
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,910
Well, you just said that no lobbies were found.

50
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,330
Hold on.

51
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,390
This is, this is the way that it booted up for me.

52
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,550
Oh, it didn't actually capture properly.

53
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,250
Just captured my full desktop and I'm gonna leak everything.

54
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,830
Never mind.

55
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,110
Yeah,

56
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,070
all those slurs that I have saved as text files on my desktop.

57
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,410
No, it's literally just your desktop wallpaper.

58
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,390
Like, you're like my favorite words.

59
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,310
All the gamer words.

60
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,570
Damn, don't worry.

61
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,670
She saves it to us all the time off stream.

62
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,670
Is this a scary game?

63
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,990
No, you get to play.

64
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,090
No, it's basketball.

65
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,610
Oh, it is?

66
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,090
Yeah.

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,810
There's a cat wearing a Santa hat.

68
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,210
You can play basketball.

69
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,590
That's the only reason why I picked this game.

70
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,470
You can play basketball in this game.

71
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,350
How do you even find these games?

72
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,610
Is, you know, like, I always stalked a popular upcoming on Steam.

73
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,230
And I saw this game before a while back.

74
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,650
And I looked at the reviews.

75
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,010
It had 7,000 reviews.

76
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,930
So I assume it's like, okay.

77
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,230
Maybe if I do return to lobby, I don't know, it seriously won't let me do that.

78
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,590
It says something weird.

79
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,430
Just crash your lobby.

80
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:57,850
Hold on.

81
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,970
It says host from here if you want to play local with your IP or offline.

82
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,690
Forward port 777 TCP and UDP for other players to join.

83
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,890
What does that even mean?

84
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,030
Your other game's progress will still be saved.

85
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,290
Nah, we got to do this the Minecraft 2008 way, bro.

86
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,470
We got to boot up Hamachi.

87
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,790
Yeah, let me boot up fucking Hamachi.

88
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,430
We're going.

89
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,570
Oh yeah.

90
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,870
We're doing this offline co-op.

91
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,570
So like, clearly you can play online.

92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,470
Yeah, we just got a port forward.

93
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,930
Right guys?

94
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,750
Wait, hold on.

95
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,690
Let me see.

96
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,330
Oh dang.

97
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,590
I guess you have to play alternate.

98
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,050
That's crazy.

99
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,310
Oh, I figured it out.

100
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,830
Oh, you did?

101
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,310
I did.

102
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,570
I clicked the port.

103
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,630
I didn't click it.

104
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,970
Wait, you actually port forwarded it?

105
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,690
You actually port forwarded it?

106
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,590
Wait, how?

107
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,770
Oh, I can join you.

108
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,470
Nice.

109
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,710
Mint just opening up holes in her router in real time.

110
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,690
Oh my gosh, she opened the port.

111
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,190
We're in her PC, guys.

112
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,930
We're in it.

113
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,310
Oh, there's local audio.

114
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,130
Do we want to use that?

115
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,130
We should use in-game.

116
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:12,670
Oh, we should do the pro streamer thing where we turn all of our individual things to zero so our foogies will still light up.

117
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,130
That's fair.

118
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,590
Yeah, of course.

119
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,790
You don't have foogies?

120
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,190
Get muted.

121
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,830
Okay, give me a sec.

122
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,490
I need to write down what I have on your Discord.

123
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,670
Oh, right.

124
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,150
I didn't actually check that.

125
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,250
That's right.

126
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,370
Mint's at 200.

127
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,190
I'm just going to have to balance everything in real time.

128
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:33,690
134.

129
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,290
Okay.

130
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,090
Wait, what?

131
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:36,870
All right.

132
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,210
Wait, how are you guys doing a thing on Discord where your foogies still light up?

133
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,290
We just put ours...

134
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,710
You put...

135
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,210
Yeah, put all of us individually zero.

136
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,050
Oh, you're so smart.

137
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,830
Um, hello?

138
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,690
I gave the idea.

139
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:50,930
Hello?

140
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,990
I'm just trusting you.

141
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,490
You were trusting us.

142
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,950
I didn't worry about it, doki.

143
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,510
It was collective.

144
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,750
Not collective!

145
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,270
You acknowledged that it was smart!

146
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,230
All right, let me see.

147
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,030
Oh, you can turn each people individually up too on in-game.

148
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,090
Yeah, I was going to say, because you're fucking level.

149
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,490
Okay, let's see.

150
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,610
Turning you guys up.

151
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,390
This is not a group idea.

152
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,150
Am I...

153
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,490
What did you do to me?

154
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,290
That was a piece of pizza.

155
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,970
How do I pick up the boomerang?

156
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,430
Yeah, you can pick up the boomerang.

157
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,470
No, my boomerang!

158
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,150
Pick it up.

159
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,170
Everyone, let me pick it up.

160
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,990
Okay, let me check my volumes.

161
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,250
Oh my god, can you suspend it?

162
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,830
Okay, one...

163
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,090
What?

164
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,230
Oh my god!

165
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,650
I'm trying to do this!

166
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:38,890
Okay.

167
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,870
Why?

168
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,990
What is that?

169
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,890
What are you doing?

170
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,870
I'm trying to tax here!

171
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,230
That's right.

172
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,530
This is exactly why I play.

173
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,270
I wanted to play this game.

174
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,690
How do you do that?

175
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,010
Wait, how do you...

176
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,190
You press up and then...

177
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,150
Emote.

178
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,190
What's four?

179
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,430
Oh, okay.

180
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,070
That's right.

181
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,790
We're going full sloppy tonight.

182
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,630
That's right.

183
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Wait, get in front of me, get in front of me!

184
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,140
Oh my god.

185
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,660
Oh my god.

186
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,940
I'm looking through the settings and I tab out and I just see a fucking train being ran right through my screen.

187
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,260
Join us, Nuffy!

188
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,700
Join us, Nuffy!

189
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,120
Join us!

190
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Join us!

191
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,260
Alt and...

192
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,820
Alt and import.

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,620
Import.

194
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,540
Import.

195
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,560
Human centipede, this is awful.

196
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,760
I'm zording it right now.

197
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm gonna zord all over.

198
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,660
I love this game already, guys.

199
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,920
There's a cat?

200
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,260
Where is he?

201
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
He's on the fridge.

202
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,060
There's no individual audio settings.

203
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,680
Where's the fridge?

204
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,580
There are!

205
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,400
There's monster volume and voice chat output volume and that's it.

206
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,140
Don't go into settings.

207
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,140
It's just in like the...

208
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,480
Not the pause menu, but...

209
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,320
Not for people, I want to turn down the sound effects.

210
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,740
Oh, it should be master volume, I think.

211
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,240
Oh my god, you can throw snowballs?

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,680
Also, am I loud?

213
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,620
Because I just noticed the thing is like...

214
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,440
My input volume is really high.

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
I think everybody's done.

216
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,800
Wait, how did you...

217
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,980
Maybe if we go like here?

218
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,900
How about here?

219
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,540
Is that better?

220
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,520
Yeah, that's good.

221
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,340
If it's still loud, let me know.

222
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
Because I have plenty of headroom to turn it down.

223
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,400
It's better this way.

224
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,840
Are you doing gotcha?

225
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,820
What is this?

226
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,500
Oh, it's normal or hard mode.

227
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,840
Okay, we should go normal mode.

228
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,360
Wait, there's crouch.

229
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,540
You don't make footsteps when you're crouching.

230
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,400
Wait, guys, guys!

231
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,800
There's a basketball court!

232
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,020
There it is!

233
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Snuffy?

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Snuffy?

235
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,260
Snuffy's with me.

236
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,740
She's with me.

237
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,380
She's right here.

238
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,400
Is this Snuffy?

239
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,740
Oh, you weren't Snuffy this entire time?

240
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,340
Maybe she crashed.

241
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Wait, did she crash?

242
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,300
Thank you for the three months!

243
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,340
Yeah, I think Intel's striking again.

244
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,780
Wait, where the fuck did Mint go?

245
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,100
Mint crashed?

246
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
No, did it go into the lobby?

247
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,180
Did it go into the game already?

248
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,700
No, I don't know where Mint is.

249
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,760
Oh my god.

250
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,920
Wait, let's see.

251
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm pointing people down.

252
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,580
Wait, did they all...

253
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,260
Wait, no.

254
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,620
Oh, wait, no, she's here!

255
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,020
She's somewhere here!

256
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,760
Wait, they're hiding!

257
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,980
Where are you guys hiding?

258
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm a little scared.

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,140
The game definitely just randomly closed, so...

260
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,640
Wait, you guys were in the back this entire time?

261
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,340
Oh my god.

262
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,180
You guys were in the back this entire time.

263
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,880
That's right.

264
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
What are we doing, huh?

265
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm going to be totally looking for you at all times.

266
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,860
That's right.

267
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm going to be scared for you.

268
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,160
Sorry!

269
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,520
These games are scary.

270
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,900
I'm going to have to go through a rigorous testing process.

271
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,840
Were you guys getting sloppy behind the house?

272
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,980
Benchmarking Zort.

273
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

274
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,020
I think you can play basketball in one of the maps.

275
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,840
There's a guitar back there.

276
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,380
Unless you can unlock this later.

277
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,820
This is the end goal.

278
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
The end goal is basketball, guys.

279
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,100
That's our end goal.

280
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,160
Right there.

281
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,320
I want a b-ball on the court.

282
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,620
Yeah, I'm here for the b-ball.

283
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,980
Some call me the baller.

284
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,820
I'm actually...

285
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,120
Press to join...

286
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,340
Do you think the more footprints we leave, the more likely it is that Snuffy crashes because it's taking more processing time?

287
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,020
Whose credit card is this?

288
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,420
Oh, I think I dropped mine.

289
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,280
Oh, wait, no.

290
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,060
This is mine.

291
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,600
I got it.

292
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,500
I have somebody's credit card.

293
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,240
So long to no stated says.

294
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,980
I just...

295
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,200
Okay, you're not getting it back then.

296
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,320
No, I want it!

297
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,540
Is that better?

298
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,880
Drop an item, actually.

299
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,080
Alright, are we ready to...

300
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,320
Are we ready to go in?

301
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:00,960
I don't know.

302
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,360
I got an employee ID.

303
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:02,840
Don't...

304
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,940
Wait, why do you have two?

305
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,540
I'm gonna leak my employee ID.

306
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,140
I'm leaking it.

307
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,100
That's scary.

308
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,380
It shows like your...

309
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,120
Your code on Steam.

310
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:13,960
Oh,

311
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,100
they don't see it.

312
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
They can't see it because...

313
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,720
Because my fookies are covering it.

314
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,660
Government ID?

315
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,680
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,060
Can't steal my identity now, chat.

317
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,300
Can't steal my identity now.

318
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,480
I've got fookies.

319
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,080
Wait, whose card is this?

320
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,700
Oh, there's no...

321
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,000
Wait, you guys can make snow...

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,180
Wait, how do you guys make snow angels?

323
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,500
I'm creeping over to you.

324
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,220
Sorry, wrong one.

325
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm sorry, what?

326
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,120
Oh, so cute!

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,580
I feel like I'm sliding around.

328
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,220
Can you change my game to Zort, please?

329
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,180
Zort?

330
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,780
Oh, wait.

331
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,500
That looks wrong.

332
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,960
That looks so wrong.

333
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,500
I gotta get out of there.

334
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,480
Oh my god!

335
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,720
Should we try a game then?

336
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,040
Also, to my sound guys, is the volume better now?

338
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,520
Bomberman?

339
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,920
Bomberman won't snow on the mic.

340
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,940
But not really.

341
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah, that's cute.

342
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,380
Alright guys, ready?

343
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,980
I'm gonna head to the first map.

344
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,280
Zortagane.

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Wait, I'm not the host.

346
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
Min has to select it.

347
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,860
Nevermind.

348
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,520
Wait, what?

349
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,560
Oh, wait, we can buy these?

350
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,940
Oh my god, we gotta buy these!

351
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,220
Oh yeah, just fucking get them all.

352
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,480
Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,820
Wait, I want a flashlight.

354
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,300
I can see a symphony!

355
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,480
Stick

356
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,000
your horn into my snoot.

357
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,400
That's Zort all over.

358
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,980
Okay, Min Min Min, ready to game up.

359
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,440
I feel like I'm an infant.

360
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,980
Alright, I'm ready to Zort all over.

361
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,000
It's Zorting time.

362
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,800
Oh my god, Poppy playtime!

363
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,820
Yeah, thank you for a thousand bits.

364
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,160
Hey, I almost thanked him too, because he looks like he's in my chat.

365
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,660
So I was about to be like, thanks Min.

366
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,780
Thanks for the thousand bits, dude!

367
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,120
I thought I was muting, hold on, let me go find a place to mute.

368
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,760
Chat, I think if you give anything to Limer, it's only fair that you share.

369
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,740
You can't only give things to one child and not the other.

370
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,040
Wait, we don't keep our horns!

371
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,320
We don't keep our horns!

372
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,020
I'm ready.

373
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,540
I'm so ready.

374
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,900
Wait, what did you do?

375
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,200
I don't know, what did I do?

376
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,640
I don't know, I opened it too.

377
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,720
Oh, we have to hold it!

378
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,820
Oh, Zorto, hey!

379
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,080
Thanks, Zorto!

380
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,020
It turned on the TV.

381
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,300
That's quiet, right?

382
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,000
I hate this channel.

383
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,420
Oh my god, you're right!

384
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,020
Oh, you can see the sound detector of how loud we are.

385
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,680
Dude, I don't like his aura.

386
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,520
Can you do a test with me?

387
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,060
Can you hear me right now?

388
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,500
That's fine, we're not that loud.

389
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,220
Oh, wait, there's flashlights here!

390
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,500
Wait,

391
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,360
isn't that Toa?

392
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,900
Toa on Windows XP?

393
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,460
Yeah, isn't that Toa?

394
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,520
Hello?

395
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,620
Hello, okay, you can hear me now?

396
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,980
Yeah, I can hear you.

397
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,760
Can you mute, hopefully, and then can you hear me?

398
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,240
Yeah.

399
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,900
Not right now, if you're talking right now, I can't hear you.

400
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,020
Alright, let's go!

401
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,260
Grab your flashlights, guys.

402
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Grab your flashlights.

403
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,900
It's right here.

404
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

405
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,540
Wait, where did you get the air horn?

406
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,260
Oh, I got it too!

407
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,300
Somebody's Oshis on the monitor.

408
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,640
No, we'll be fine.

409
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,700
We'll be so fine.

410
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Wait, how do we- Oh, we have to use our ID cards here, right?

411
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,380
Yeah.

412
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,000
No, use your ID card.

413
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,800
Yeah.

414
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,140
I think we're like employees here in the Zord Factory.

415
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,980
No findings to eat on the ground.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,660
We're all gonna fucking die.

417
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,460
We gotta be quiet in this area, guys.

418
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,440
Wait, this is a noise-friendly environment.

419
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,160
Yeah.

420
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,880
How dare you tell us to go quiet.

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,540
This is a free country.

422
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,220
What's going on?

423
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,940
Zord.

424
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,680
We're here to Zord- Oh, no, I'm ill.

425
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm- I saw a man.

426
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,600
I saw- I saw a man.

427
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,820
I don't feel so good.

428
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,540
No, no.

429
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,260
Do you not see him?

430
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
He's right there!

431
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,820
He's right there!

432
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,780
You see him, right?

433
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,920
It's a man!

434
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,560
He's right there!

435
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,100
Yeah, I see him!

436
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,340
Is he smiling at you?

437
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah, he's smiling at me.

438
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,160
Do you not see him?

439
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,900
I don't see anything.

440
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,260
There's a man right there!

441
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,780
Maybe I shouldn't be playing here.

442
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,920
There's a hole.

443
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,420
I think she went in the hole and got eaten.

444
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
There's a hole.

445
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,420
There's a hole!

446
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,340
She's dead.

447
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,200
Don't go in that hole.

448
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,860
There's a hole!

449
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,080
Do you think we need to take her ID card back with us?

450
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,240
Oh my god.

451
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,160
Of course I'm the one that dies first!

452
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,780
Oh my god.

453
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,480
Of course it's me.

454
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,860
What the fuck?

455
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,220
Which one's the real?

456
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,440
Why are they all twerking at me?

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,260
I don't know.

458
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,700
I think the person is about to get me.

459
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,600
Oh, there's two men!

460
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,340
There's three men!

461
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
I gotta go!

462
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,540
I gotta get out of here.

463
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,860
Why me?

464
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,280
Why me?

465
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,180
Mint is hallucinating men.

466
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,860
Mint is hallucinating men.

467
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,680
Mint is hallucinating men.

468
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,780
Mint is hallucinating men.

469
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,280
Mint is hallucinating men.

470
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,860
No, they don't see it!

471
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,860
The man we see!

472
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,060
Okay, this is a freaky game.

473
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,780
We're in the first fucking room and we're gonna die.

474
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,080
They should all just jump in the hole.

475
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,920
Just jump into the hole.

476
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,520
How did they all not see the hole?

477
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,640
How was I the only one that saw the hole?

478
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,020
That's so fucked up.

479
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,280
That is actually so fucked up.

480
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,360
Of course I'm the only one that sees the hole.

481
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,620
Because I got scared of that man that stared at me.

482
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,820
I didn't see the hole!

483
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,240
I guess we gotta go into the other...

484
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,860
Gamers, don't look down.

485
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,260
Who the fuck looks down?

486
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,320
I've never practiced circles.

487
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,740
I've only practiced triangles and...

488
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,860
Triangles and squares!

489
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,610
What the fuck?

490
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,690
I think I might have just summoned the...

491
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,290
Wait, I'm alive?

492
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,290
What the fuck?

493
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,270
What the fuck?

494
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,790
Okay, I thought it was like...

495
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,570
I thought she summoned a chair.

496
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,790
She turned into a chair.

497
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,170
But then I started moving.

498
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,490
I was like, wait, I'm alive.

499
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,670
Like, I think I summoned it.

500
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,110
And then it shows a chair.

501
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,230
And then I was like...

502
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,370
Oh my god.

503
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,410
Wait, I lost my flashlight in the hole.

504
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,830
Oh, I'm not crazy anymore.

505
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,950
I'm not crazy anymore, guys.

506
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,410
I'm not crazy anymore.

507
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,890
Thank fucking god.

508
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,870
I know, I'm not getting...

509
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,730
I'm not going back into...

510
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,170
I don't know.

511
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,250
Wait, is that...

512
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,110
I'm cured, guys.

513
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,230
I'm not crazy anymore.

514
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,710
Wait, wait, wait.

515
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,830
Does this vending machine work?

516
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,430
Wait, oh my god.

517
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,010
No, I got flashlight again.

518
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,190
All you have to do is just jump in the hole.

519
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,490
That's how I got fixed.

520
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,850
You had to...

521
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,110
Okay, maybe she is a monster.

522
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,030
If you jump in the hole, you'll...

523
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,310
You'll get fixed.

524
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,250
Your mental health will be cured.

525
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,930
Yeah, I'll improve your mental health, guys.

526
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,730
Trust me, it worked for me.

527
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,190
Push the button?

528
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,510
Oh, do we leave?

529
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,470
Okay, I'm pushing it.

530
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,390
Well, we haven't collected anything, so we should probably do that first.

531
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,710
I found a chocolate bar.

532
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,110
Wait, is there anything over here?

533
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,350
Well, this is a tutorial.

534
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,830
No, no, no, no, you insta-die.

535
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,450
No, no, no, no, the holes are insta-death.

536
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,230
I'm pretty sure it's like a tutorial.

537
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,910
Yeah, it would be kind of like...

538
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,390
Your friend, Dexter, will not be able to come.

539
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,570
Yeah, I'm pretty sure...

540
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,010
Oh my god, the fuck was that?

541
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,570
Okay, apparently we shouldn't collect gas cans.

542
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,630
What the fuck?

543
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,950
Okay, but what if...

544
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,750
Okay, I got one.

545
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,730
I got one that worked.

546
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,930
Our life is on the line and you're huffing gas.

547
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,950
No, I'm collecting things.

548
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,930
Oh, I think it's like some items are bad.

549
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,910
Let me eat these noodles.

550
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,950
How does it tell me I can google translate this sign?

551
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,110
You are...

552
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,710
Oh, if you have a Rubik's Cube, it will make you sane, apparently.

553
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,970
Wait, we should give that to Min.

554
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,490
No, I'm better now because of the music.

555
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,070
I'm better.

556
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,610
Oh, I see.

557
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,750
Oh, okay, it fills the...

558
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,350
If you hit tab, you can see item information.

559
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that.

560
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,170
There's more gas here.

561
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,470
Fuck your flies.

562
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,650
What's the gas for?

563
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,950
I don't know, it says it'll power stuff up.

564
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,650
I saw a gas can...

565
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,830
Yeah, yeah, that's an evil gas can.

566
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,730
I think it knows that Min's a little crazy.

567
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,410
But like, where do we put the gas can?

568
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,730
I think it's just a tutorial.

569
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,070
Yeah, I think we can just go to the exit, right?

570
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,340
I guess we can leave now, right?

571
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,860
I guess we exit now.

572
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
Yeah, I think this is just a tutorial.

573
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,440
This has to be, right?

574
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:48,980
Yeah.

575
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,160
Yeah, yeah, we should all just stand there and see what happens.

576
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,120
Alright.

577
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,120
Bump, bump, bump, bump.

578
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,520
Who hasn't pressed the button?

579
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,020
Someone hasn't pressed it.

580
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,020
Oh.

581
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,640
Oh.

582
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,220
Oh, wow.

583
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,300
Oh.

584
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,980
Oh.

585
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,200
Oh.

586
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,280
What the fuck?

587
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,360
We gotta find Zordy.

588
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,380
We gotta find Zordy.

589
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,340
Thank you, Zordy.

590
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:42,800
Okay.

591
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,820
Alright, alright, we gotta find Zordy.

592
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,290
I'm pretty sure Zordy is meant to be like a drill.

593
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,290
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Zordy is the drill.

594
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,530
Oh, it says something opened up.

595
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,370
Oh, they opened up!

596
00:29:59,410 --> 00:29:59,970
It opened up!

597
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,830
Right there.

598
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,210
Oh, yeah, this whole area opened up.

599
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,830
Okay.

601
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,350
Zordy!

602
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,130
Zordy, where are you?

603
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,830
Is that Zordy?

604
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,750
That's Zordy the drill!

605
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,750
We need Jimmy's key.

606
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,710
Hey, we can get a bottle.

607
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,550
Okay, we have to go this way to the right.

608
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,430
Oh, okay.

609
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,690
We gotta go this way.

610
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,990
Note from Jimmy, password equals my high score.

611
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,890
This improves mental health.

612
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,270
What did I just do?

613
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,170
Oh!

614
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,490
Who's he?

615
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,750
Who's this guy?

616
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,130
I think we have a stream sniper.

617
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,690
Who is this?

618
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,870
Wait, he's following me.

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,870
Oh, it imprinted me!

620
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,290
Maybe you'll occupy his body if you die.

621
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,150
What is he doing?

622
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,950
It's just a little guy.

623
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,190
Oh, yeah, I just summoned him on accident.

624
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:04,770
Yeah.

625
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,650
Which one's me?

626
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,790
Why didn't he...

627
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,010
Why didn't he imprint on me?

628
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,210
There's something coming!

629
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,290
There is!

630
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,850
What's our guy doing?

631
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,210
Snuffy, there's something coming!

632
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,680
Wait, is that Snuffy?

633
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,720
He's looking at us!

634
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,020
He's looking at us!

635
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,420
Oh, he's leaving?

636
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,500
Oh, kind of.

637
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,180
Wait, is that Snuffy?

638
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,600
Is that Snuffy or is this Snuffy?

639
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,300
Remember, you have your guy, right?

640
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,320
Uh...

641
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:49,810
Uh...

642
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,450
Are there a bunch of voices in here?

643
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,090
Mint's dead.

644
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,690
What the fuck?!

645
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,010
What the fuck is that?!

646
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,380
Oh, he's carrying him away.

647
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,240
Yeah, I dropped that and they're taking it.

648
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,660
They're taking him.

649
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,420
I feel like this is a fever dream.

650
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,600
Like, what is going on?

651
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,160
I guess we're gonna put him back here.

652
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,500
Oh, wait, this is like Smiling Friends, the big king.

653
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,340
Wait, there's Zordy.

654
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,670
Will this become Mint?

655
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,150
And you shall become Mint.

656
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,230
Oh, there she is!

657
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,370
Mint?

658
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,230
Is this Mint?

659
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,010
Oh, that is not Mint.

660
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,390
Now we have two Zordys.

661
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,690
Yeah,

662
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,760
yeah, the funny thing killed.

663
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,520
Which one's Mint?

664
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,800
Which one is she?

665
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,860
What do I do?

666
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
How do I drop him?

667
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,140
Oh, no.

668
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,200
Press G.

669
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,360
Press G.

670
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,600
No, I want them to follow me.

671
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,820
Wait, there's another one!

672
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,640
We can do this one!

673
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,360
This might be Mint.

674
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,100
This might be her.

675
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,200
I know I have space right now.

676
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,440
I can drop my ID.

677
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,900
I dropped my ID.

678
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,780
Alright, Mint!

679
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,980
Be reborn!

680
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,460
Mint, is this you?

681
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,900
BE REBORN!

682
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,680
Wait, where's my ID?

683
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,440
Is this my ID?

684
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,740
Yeah, this is my ID.

685
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,280
Oh, there's another Rubik's Cube here!

686
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,100
What is it?

687
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,800
What are they saying?

688
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,100
Notes from Jimmy.

689
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,140
Password equals my high score.

690
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,520
Oh, she's back!

691
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,040
She's back!

692
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,620
She's back!

693
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,820
Oh my God, who is he looking at?

694
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,240
Who is the bunny looking at?

695
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,320
Nope.

696
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,940
Do you think it's me?

697
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,100
Are you fine, Zordy?

698
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,360
Where is Zordy?

699
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,540
What's going on?

700
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,680
I don't know!

701
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,060
I have my own little army.

702
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,100
We need to find like an arcade cabinet or something.

703
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,820
I just feel like I have to do something with...

704
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,480
Oh wait, I have a gas can for it.

705
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,700
I have a gas can.

706
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,840
I have a gas can for the generator.

707
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,420
Where is it?

708
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,200
Where is it?

709
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,420
Yeah, but we need to find the...

710
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,740
What do we do with this thing?

711
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,760
I don't know, but I'm letting them follow me around.

712
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,920
Big king.

713
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,920
Yeah, you want this guy?

714
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,620
You want him?

715
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,880
We need to go find that guy's high score.

716
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,100
Yeah, we need to find his cabinet.

717
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,880
I'm ill again!

718
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,540
Why is everything happening to me?

719
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,360
Hold on, I'll be right back.

720
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,100
Alright, yeah, no problem.

721
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,080
We're like stuck in this...

722
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,220
Do you want a Rubik's Cube?

723
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,360
No, I'm gonna use the music.

724
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,200
Okay.

725
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,200
A new product is on the second floor.

726
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,980
I remember where there was arcade machines.

727
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,460
Oh wait.

728
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah, it's in the lobby.

729
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,860
I feel like...

730
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,280
What was that?

731
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,540
It's fine, don't worry about it.

732
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
There's a collectible here.

733
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,060
What the fuck am I gonna do with all of you?

734
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,840
What are you?

735
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,440
What am I gonna do with you guys?

736
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,640
How are we stuck in the first level?

737
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,500
I mean, you could put the Yamaneko back.

738
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,780
Yeah, but like...

739
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,280
But like, what are we gonna do with him?

740
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,020
I am a mom now.

741
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,580
Hello.

742
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,580
Alright, I'm gonna...

743
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,220
I have an idea.

744
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,060
I'm gonna chuck him in the hole.

745
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,680
Bye.

746
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,760
Wait, how did you open this?

747
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,060
There's so many of us.

748
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,560
You pressed the button?

749
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,440
There was a button?

750
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,460
What's this?

751
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,740
Oh, I got a collectible.

752
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,500
Oh yeah, we have five.

753
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,120
Oh, there's Jimmy.

754
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,340
There's a bunny again.

755
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,840
Oh, the bunny.

756
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,140
Wait, she's only after you.

757
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,040
It's only after you.

758
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,480
Wait, wait, wait.

759
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,700
I think the bunny hates...

760
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,040
Yeah, the bunny hates sound.

761
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,720
Yeah, just keep yelling at it.

762
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,540
I'm good at that.

763
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,060
Okay, wait, wait.

764
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,020
What's the high score?

765
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,040
Wait, what game is this?

766
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,080
Okay, I can't see the screen, guys.

767
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm trying to get high score.

768
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,280
I got the door open.

769
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,120
Oh, you did?

770
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,600
We're playing video games.

771
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:20,600
I'm an echo, I'm an echo, I'm an echo.

772
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,520
Oh, creature.

773
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,420
Wait, what's this?

774
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,040
I turned on the PC, guys.

775
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,660
Is everybody okay?

776
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,120
Wild creature is unknown where the creature come from.

777
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,580
There are rumors that it's made from materials in a factory, but this does not comply with the rules of both physics and logic.

778
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,120
Researchers are investigating what caused this.

779
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,360
Okay, it's Zord.

780
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,960
Wait, what's this?

781
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,020
What is this?

782
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,380
Oh, it's more gas cans.

783
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,500
I already have one, though.

784
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,820
What do we do with all these gas cans?

785
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,760
What?

786
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,780
Oh!

787
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,900
Oh my god, I've been holding onto this this entire time.

788
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,320
What?

789
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,220
I didn't do anything.

790
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,280
No, I did.

791
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,500
I think it's already been used.

792
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,260
No.

793
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,560
Where?

794
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,860
I'm worried.

795
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,700
I'm worried.

796
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,500
Wait, is that... Who is this guy?

797
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,740
Oh, I have bowling balls!

798
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,740
Yay!

799
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,920
Watch this.

800
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,120
Okay, uh...

801
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,160
Don't look.

802
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,900
Oh, you're not supposed to look at the...

803
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,940
You're not supposed to look at the man.

804
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,860
That man.

805
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,800
How do we get anything for bowling a strike?

806
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,620
Wait, did you get anything?

807
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,800
Yeah, I did.

808
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:43,880
Wait,

809
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,940
you got the key, right?

810
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,320
Yeah, that's right!

811
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Leave!

812
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:56,660
Leave!

813
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,400
That's right!

814
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,620
Wait, wait, wait.

815
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,800
Lime, you got the key, right?

816
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,860
Snuffy has it right now.

817
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,560
The key's here.

818
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,740
Use the key for this.

819
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,160
Yeah, the button.

820
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,180
The second floor button.

821
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,210
Oh, you found my friend?

822
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,330
Jimmy's key.

823
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,810
You should open it.

824
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,150
Okay, hold.

825
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,150
Um...

826
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,190
Uh -oh.

827
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,990
Why?

828
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,370
Why?

829
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,230
There's a guy.

830
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,230
There's a guy.

831
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,110
Oh, there's a guy.

832
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,090
There's a guy.

833
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,430
Wait, wait, wait!

834
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,530
Strike!

835
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,580
She missed!

836
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,800
I got the bully ball!

837
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,560
Don't worry!

838
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,580
I'm a professional.

839
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,680
Wait, where is she?

840
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,560
Where's the cat?

841
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,160
Don't worry, I got bully ball too!

842
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:27,980
Strike!

843
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,820
I missed.

844
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,640
She didn't like that!

845
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,720
The cat did not like that!

846
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
The cat did not like that!

847
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,380
The cat did not like it!

848
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,480
She did not like it!

849
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,140
He didn't like it!

850
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,960
He didn't like it!

851
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,800
How is this guy in front of me?

852
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,280
Who are you?

853
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,380
Are you an NPC?

854
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
Did you save me?

855
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,460
Don't worry.

856
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,580
Don't worry, I got you.

857
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,180
Thank you.

858
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,920
Don't worry, I got you.

859
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,520
Wait, what happened?

860
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,460
This isn't it.

861
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,600
Who are you?

862
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,080
Are you an NPC?

863
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,300
Were you never real?

864
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,840
Were you never real?

865
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,400
We're just bullying the cat!

866
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,120
I've been trying to bully bully the cat!

867
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,790
She'll just end up in the bathroom.

868
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,010
That's just what happens.

869
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,290
Wait, she turned into a Rubik's Cube.

870
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,950
Oh my god, who was that?

871
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,610
Who died?

872
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,570
That's not Fiji, right?

873
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,590
I'm seeing the Matrix, Doki.

874
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,570
I don't think that's good.

875
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,910
We were supposed to turn on...

876
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,930
Wait, we didn't even open the second floor.

877
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,710
I fixed the generator, we need to go open the door now.

878
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,710
I'm losing it.

879
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,490
I need the music.

880
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,750
Don't worry, the cat's too busy with Mint right now.

881
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,700
Alright, I'm pressing it.

882
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,480
I got the door.

883
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,240
Don't worry.

884
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,160
We'll sort our way out of here.

885
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,040
It's just us two.

886
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,970
Hey, what's up?

887
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:07,490
The moment you entered, I realized it was just us two alive.

888
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,730
Mint did not live.

889
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,670
Oh shit, do you have a noise thingy?

890
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:13,890
Doki, Doki, Doki!

891
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,590
I have enough, too.

892
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,170
I have Mint.

893
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,550
Don't worry, Mint!

894
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,210
You shall be reborn!

895
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,470
Welcome back, Mint!

896
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,350
Yay!

897
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:39,490
Okay, I held down that button earlier and it looped and the door didn't open.

898
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,670
I got robbed.

899
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,690
Sure, you did.

900
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,210
Sure, you did.

901
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,290
I did.

902
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,950
Locked from behind.

903
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,810
Wait, does anyone know the code for this?

904
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,410
I think the code might be go through the window.

905
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,130
8008?

906
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,870
Oh shit, I wrote the wrong boop.

907
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:02,550
Whoa!

908
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,510
Fake items.

909
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,730
It's not boop, guys.

910
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:17,730
It wasn't boop.

911
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,430
Yeah, I tried it already.

912
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,430
It wasn't boop.

913
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:24,950
Does anyone have a bottle?

914
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,350
How do we get sorted?

915
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,730
We can get one from the vending machine.

916
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,130
Maybe we can get a bottle and break the glass.

917
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,810
The glass is already broken.

918
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,170
We just can't jump up.

919
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,190
No, it's not.

920
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:37,990
Watch this.

921
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,930
Guys, I'm losing it again.

922
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,970
Don't throw it at the cheese.

923
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:50,730
Wait, what if I throw the bottle at...

924
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,130
Oh, it's fucked up.

925
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,310
Oh my god!

926
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,470
Go rat, go!

927
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,690
Does anyone have a Rubik's cube?

928
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,930
I'm about to fucking die.

929
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,050
Don't worry, we all have seven dollars.

930
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,610
Wait, I opened it.

931
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,410
I did it, guys.

932
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,270
3131 is the code.

933
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:16,290
3131.

934
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,510
Wait, there's Zoran.

935
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,850
Where'd they come from?

936
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,510
You are ill.

937
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,010
What's this?

938
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,710
3131, the code is 3131.

939
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,770
I said that.

940
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,570
Nobody listened to me.

941
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,590
I said that.

942
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,810
Thank you.

943
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,150
Oh, jump.

944
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,290
Oh, it taught us how to jump.

945
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,650
Wait, there's an extra Zordy here.

946
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,070
Okay, we need another glass.

947
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:53,910
What's this?

948
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,370
Wait, there's a Rubik's cube here, though.

949
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,070
No, I saw one.

950
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,930
We need a bottle.

951
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,090
Do you guys have an extra bottle?

952
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,290
Oh, okay, I'm seeing death.

953
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,230
I'm seeing death.

954
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,330
I'm seeing death.

955
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,470
I'm leaving the matrix.

956
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,550
Do you guys have an extra bottle?

957
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,230
We need an extra bottle.

958
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,750
No,

959
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,190
we can keep ordering bottles.

960
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,990
Yeah, we can order bottles for free.

961
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,590
Yes, he's right here.

962
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,430
He's right here.

963
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,930
I told you, I saw a Rubik's cube right here.

964
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,430
It's already solved.

965
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,430
It's already solved.

966
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:46,910
Oh, she solved it?

967
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:47,390
Too smart.

968
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,510
Alright, let's throw the bottle.

969
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:53,270
The ill effects are really annoying.

970
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,090
Are you sure Doki didn't die?

971
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,830
Doki, are you dead?

972
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,890
I'm right here.

973
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,970
I mean, Doki is...

974
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,110
Doki is dead for me, I don't know.

975
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,150
Doki is a skinwalker.

976
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,690
I just read a thing about that.

977
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:09,650
Wait, what did it say?

978
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,050
What?

979
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,130
Wait, who's that over there?

980
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,190
Wait, why is there two...

981
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,380
Where did he come from?

982
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,360
What

983
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,940
about this glass?

984
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,700
Maybe we have to try this glass.

985
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,940
Wait, who's who?

986
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,360
I can't tell.

987
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,340
There's too many of us.

988
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,840
How are you all seeing people?

989
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,020
There's so many!

990
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,480
Where are they coming from?

991
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,550
Where are they spawning?

992
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:26,930
I don't know where they're spawning from!

993
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,470
Guys, I actually bought a flashlight.

994
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,870
I'm pretty sure we have to wait for players.

995
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,320
What the fuck?

996
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:56,920
Wait!

997
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,760
What the...

998
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,600
They fight back!

999
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,040
They fight...

1000
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,660
One of them shit me!

1001
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,320
Yeah, they're skinwalkers.

1002
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:11,960
They're skinwalkers.

1003
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:12,800
I thought you died.

1004
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,560
They hit me!

1005
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,940
I'm climbing!

1006
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,420
I'm climbing!

1007
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:18,820
Let's go!

1008
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,160
Let's go!

1009
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:19,580
Let's go!

1010
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,680
There's no way.

1011
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,050
I have Zordy.

1012
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,330
You have Zordy?

1013
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,250
Can you find a Rubik's Cube?

1014
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,950
I'm stuck!

1015
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,050
I can't move!

1016
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,830
Why can't I move?

1017
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,210
I can't move!

1018
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,210
I can't move!

1019
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,250
It won't let me pass!

1020
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,830
I'm okay, guys.

1021
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,610
I'm okay, guys.

1022
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,230
I'm okay.

1023
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,730
I'm not a skinwalker.

1024
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,350
I'm real.

1025
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:07,910
I'm real.

1026
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,330
I'm pushing it.

1027
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,390
Why is there more Zordys?

1028
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,690
Are we supposed to push it through here?

1029
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,070
Maybe all of us together.

1030
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,350
Yeah, I'm number three.

1031
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,650
I see something.

1032
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,130
I don't know how to activate this.

1033
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:37,650
Wait, what about this?

1034
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,490
It says we need a saw.

1035
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,090
Oh, I have food!

1036
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:43,690
I have food!

1037
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,130
Guys, I can't see anything.

1038
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,790
I don't know where I am.

1039
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,150
Guys, guys, guys!

1040
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,210
Here's food!

1041
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,110
Take the food.

1042
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,070
It restores sanity.

1043
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:00,980
I need food.

1044
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,320
Okay, that didn't work for you, I guess.

1045
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,680
I think Min is stuck in the vents, guys.

1046
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,740
How do we do this?

1047
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,540
I don't think we can.

1048
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,560
I think they're just here for...

1049
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,020
What?

1050
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,000
We're trying to figure out how to get back up top!

1051
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,640
How do we get back up top, too?

1052
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,960
Wait, no, the saw is right here, guys!

1053
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,080
The saw is in here!

1054
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,340
Min, just stay in here for a bit!

1055
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,140
We're doing something important!

1056
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,190
Don't worry, we'll come for you later!

1057
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,870
Don't worry, we'll come for you later, Min!

1058
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,590
Don't worry, we'll come for you later, Min!

1059
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,310
What is she saying?

1060
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,110
Alright, activate the zort!

1061
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,710
It's zorting time!

1062
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:12,630
Alright, don't worry, Min!

1063
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:13,690
I got the flashlight!

1064
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,810
Where are you?

1065
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:22,910
Hello?

1066
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,360
I don't think she's okay.

1067
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:47,990
Don't worry!

1068
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,050
Zorts can't climb!

1069
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,630
Is everything okay?

1070
00:54:59,010 --> 00:54:59,830
Oh, we did it!

1071
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,770
Don't worry, we'll fix it later.

1072
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,910
We gotta take the zorty to the elevator!

1073
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,300
Wait, there's bullet balls in there!

1074
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,020
He's stuck!

1075
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,480
Oh, he's after me!

1076
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,020
He's after me!

1077
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,660
He's after me!

1078
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,130
Please!

1079
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:43,570
Get him off!

1080
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:44,950
Get him off!

1081
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:45,670
He's stuck!

1082
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,670
Just get him off!

1083
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,630
I'm in the back rooms!

1084
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,410
Oh no, I'm in the back rooms!

1085
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,190
Oh no!

1086
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,410
Not the back rooms!

1087
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,770
Where am I?

1088
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,190
Oh, where am I?

1089
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,340
I don't like this.

1090
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,770
Oh no, I'm lost.

1091
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,980
Where am I?

1092
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,900
Where am I?

1093
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,620
I'm already lost in the back rooms!

1094
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,080
I just started!

1095
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:37,590
What?

1096
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,150
Oh, there's a door here.

1097
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,590
Hello?

1098
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,280
Hey guys!

1099
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,820
Hey, I'm back!

1100
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,720
It's like nothing bad happened to me.

1101
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,240
Where's everybody else?

1102
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,400
Why is it just us two?

1103
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,340
What happened?

1104
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,980
What happened?

1105
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,960
What happened in the back rooms?

1106
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,020
I was in the back rooms!

1107
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,600
Yeah!

1108
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,560
It took me to the back rooms!

1109
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,400
Where did our Zordy go?

1110
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,760
Please, please, I can't go back!

1111
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,180
I can't go back to the back rooms!

1112
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,360
I can't go back to the back rooms!

1113
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:47,880
Please!

1114
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,540
Please, I can't!

1115
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,640
Take her and not me!

1116
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,640
Take her and not me!

1117
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,700
Take her!

1118
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,900
Oh no!

1119
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,300
Oh no!

1120
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,140
Oh no!

1121
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,230
We have to win together as a team!

1122
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,530
As a team!

1123
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,070
I don't want to go back to the back rooms!

1124
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:19,790
I don't want to go back!

1125
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,550
I don't want to go back!

1126
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:24,980
Please!

1127
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,420
I don't want to go back to the back rooms!

1128
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,600
We did it!

1129
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,680
We did it!

1130
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,540
I'm gonna take her stuff.

1131
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,120
Is this someone?

1132
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,580
I don't fucking know anymore, dude.

1133
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,750
I know, I know!

1134
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,350
I know!

1135
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,290
I'm trying to get shanked by this guy.

1136
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,930
Thank you!

1137
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,870
It's the same fucking hall!

1138
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,190
Oh my god!

1139
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,630
GG!

1140
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,090
How did I die?

1141
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,050
I died to the same hall!

1142
00:59:59,370 --> 00:59:59,770
How did that happen?

1143
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,770
I don't want to be triggering those dolls!

1144
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,410
We were so close to the end!

1145
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,430
We can do this again!

1146
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:07,210
I don't know why!

1147
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,490
We made eyes through!

1148
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:11,250
I didn't die first!

1149
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,130
We know how to play!

1150
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,370
We know now, we speedrun!

1151
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,310
We know now!

1152
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,130
You gotta pick it!

1153
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,330
You gotta be the one to pick it!

1154
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,990
I think we have to finish it to unlock it, though.

1155
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,370
I'm ready!

1156
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:30,590
I'm so ready!

1157
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,950
All of us can skip, yeah!

1158
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,690
Someone's not skipping it!

1159
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:47,970
Snuffy!

1160
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,910
Snuffy!

1161
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:57,010
Alright, let's go!

1162
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:57,690
Let's mid-max!

1163
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,490
Oh, we have to turn this on first.

1164
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,510
Alright, mid-max time!

1165
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,510
Thank you, thank you!

1166
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,130
I'm ready to zort!

1167
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,110
I'm ready to zort!

1168
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,830
I'm zorting!

1169
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,110
I'm ready!

1170
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,650
Open the door!

1171
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,670
Open the door!

1172
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,370
Open the door!

1173
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,410
I'm zorting!

1174
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,430
Open it!

1175
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,790
There we go!

1176
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,790
I think for that, yeah!

1177
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,130
I think it's so to like...

1178
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,310
So like the skinwalk...

1179
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,910
It's to convince us...

1180
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,010
For skinwalkers.

1181
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,790
Oh no!

1182
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,830
Come on, everyone!

1183
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:24,870
We gotta press the button!

1184
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,090
Wait, we're missing one.

1185
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:28,870
We're missing one.

1186
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,230
No, she's not dead because it's waiting for other players.

1187
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,070
Oh, there she is!

1188
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:36,770
Nice, alright.

1189
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,050
Now we go this way.

1190
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:38,130
Okay.

1191
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,310
I'm gonna grab...

1192
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,950
I'm gonna grab money.

1193
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,270
I got a Rubik's Cube too.

1194
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,150
Yeah, there's more here.

1195
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,530
No, no, no, you just have to press E.

1196
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:02,670
Alright.

1197
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,150
Someone asked like...

1198
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,050
Wait, is the Jimmy High score the same one?

1199
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,150
It's different?

1200
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,270
I got gas cans too.

1201
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,270
I'm gonna play it.

1202
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,330
I'm gonna play Bomberman.

1203
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,410
I'm playing Bomberman.

1204
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:36,730
Nice.

1205
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,570
I lost.

1206
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:43,750
Okay.

1207
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,170
And then...

1208
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:48,170
Where's the key?

1209
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:55,030
Alright, let's go, let's go.

1210
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,550
Wait, get BoomBall ready!

1211
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,650
Or he's gonna start zording.

1212
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,930
Okay, I'm gonna stay at the generator.

1213
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,230
I have a gas can for it.

1214
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,670
Pew-pew, pew-pew.

1215
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,010
I got it.

1216
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,400
Oh, no.

1217
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,180
Don't look.

1218
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,200
Alright,

1219
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:36,940
I'm gonna head over.

1220
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,360
I'm running.

1221
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,690
Why don't you?!

1222
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,020
Oh, no.

1223
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:46,900
Oh, no.

1224
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,940
There's so many.

1225
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,740
Oh, goodbye.

1226
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,920
Goodbye.

1227
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,000
Wait, where's Snuffy?

1228
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:08,880
Snuffy?

1229
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:10,700
Snuffy?

1230
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,360
Um...

1231
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,360
Um...

1232
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,140
Where did Snuffy go?

1233
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
Where are they?

1234
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,460
Oh, why are they all crazy?

1235
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,040
Wait, wait.

1236
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,140
Is that...

1237
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,840
He's not real.

1238
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,720
That's not a real zord, is he?

1239
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,120
Is that those...

1240
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,100
Maybe one of them, um...

1241
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,880
One of them could be the real snorty, right?

1242
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,740
One of you guys are Snuffy, right?

1243
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,060
Is one of you Snuffy?

1244
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,920
If you're the real Snuffy, please stand up!

1245
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,960
Please stand up!

1246
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580
Literally, one of you has to be...

1247
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,100
Oh, they're all dead.

1248
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:04,240
Snuffy?

1249
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:06,880
He's in here.

1250
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,340
Snuffy?

1251
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,940
Where did she go?

1252
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:16,960
Snuffy?

1253
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,940
Snuffy?

1254
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,300
Snuffy?

1255
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,920
Snuffy's hiding somewhere.

1256
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,100
But where is she hiding?

1257
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,460
Snuffy?

1258
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:45,810
No!

1259
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:51,190
Please don't bring me back to the backgrounds!

1260
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:52,910
No!

1261
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:54,990
No!

1262
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:56,790
Please!

1263
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:09,190
Hello?

1264
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:09,190
Hello?

1265
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,400
Snuffy?

1266
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:29,030
Snuffy, where are you?

1267
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,910
Where did you go?

1268
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:35,950
Where have you been?

1269
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,150
Did you go on an adventure?

1270
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,260
Where did you go, Snuffy?

1271
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,900
We were worried about you.

1272
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,340
Okay, I'm bringing Mint back.

1273
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,040
Snuffy?

1274
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,760
Mint, you're back.

1275
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,820
Welcome back, Mint.

1276
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,280
Welcome back.

1277
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,900
That was so good.

1278
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,500
Where was Snuffy?

1279
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,960
Oh, come on.

1280
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,060
The guy was chasing me.

1281
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:07,580
Really?

1282
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,240
If you don't want to get hit, he won't get you.

1283
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:11,300
Yeah.

1284
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:15,180
If you crouch, he literally just looks like standing next to you.

1285
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,140
I can't.

1286
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,720
Shut the fuck up.

1287
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,280
I can't see the glass, okay?

1288
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,940
Don't shoot!

1289
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,660
I hit myself!

1290
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,000
I hit myself!

1291
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:47,660
I don't understand.

1292
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,080
I give up.

1293
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,120
Someone else do this.

1294
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,820
You're not very good at throwing stuff.

1295
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,800
Oh, yeah!

1296
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:55,600
Yeah!

1297
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,320
What was that, huh?

1298
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,500
I literally did it the first time.

1299
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,280
I'm just saying, you know.

1300
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,620
I had a concussion.

1301
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,680
You can't blame me.

1302
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,440
Very good.

1303
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,620
There's a man in front of me.

1304
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,460
Snuffy!

1305
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,340
There's a man in front of me.

1306
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,440
I'm the dependable type.

1307
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:16,940
What is it?

1308
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,600
What's the code?

1309
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,540
I'm loading the data.

1310
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,040
Nine, okay.

1311
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,000
Nine, eight.

1312
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,380
Nine, eight.

1313
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,280
Alright, let's go.

1314
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,180
I'm gonna rubix my cube a little bit.

1315
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,160
I don't have a flashlight.

1316
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,220
Someone else does this.

1317
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,460
Oh, there's another imposter, dude.

1318
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,760
Why are they a thing?

1319
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,720
Damn it, there's a guy right there.

1320
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,160
Let's see.

1321
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,360
Got a flashlight.

1322
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,420
Let's go.

1323
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:47,440
I'm heading over.

1324
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,660
I'm coming over.

1325
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,120
Hello?

1326
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,420
Testing, testing.

1327
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,260
Jump down, jump down.

1328
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,040
Oh, there it is.

1329
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,680
Being in the color yellow.

1330
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,140
Why can't I?

1331
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,320
Why can't I?

1332
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,560
How can the imposter do it, but I can't?

1333
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:16,200
What makes you different?

1334
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,740
It's like deep inside the bin.

1335
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's right here.

1336
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,940
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1337
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,240
Okay, now I'm gonna saw it.

1338
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,340
I don't know who's real.

1339
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:32,800
Who are you?

1340
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,060
Who are you?

1341
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,220
Who are you?

1342
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,260
Do you have like a therapeutic kind of toy to play with?

1343
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,380
Okay, we all have the...

1344
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:44,860
Do you want one?

1345
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:46,940
Yeah.

1346
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,140
It's gonna start coming upstairs.

1347
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,140
Do we have bowling balls?

1348
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,380
Do we have bowling balls on us?

1349
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,860
I don't know how true that is.

1350
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,560
I have a bottle.

1351
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,360
I have a bottle just in case.

1352
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,960
I'm gonna get more bottles.

1353
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,840
We need weapons, we need weapons.

1354
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,540
That big guy.

1355
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,220
Bottles are free, remember.

1357
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,960
Yeah, bottles are free, just hit him on the ground.

1358
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:13,780
Have him ready.

1359
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,960
There he is.

1360
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,360
I hit him, but it did nothing.

1361
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:24,420
No!

1362
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:25,720
Please!

1363
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,860
Why didn't anyone hit him?

1364
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:28,600
No!

1365
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,080
I don't wanna go back!

1366
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:30,760
Please!

1367
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,400
I

1368
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,260
don't...

1369
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,200
What the fuck?

1370
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,160
Why didn't no one do anything?

1371
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:54,820
No!

1372
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,960
Why did you all watch?

1373
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:03,900
Why?

1374
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,970
Why?

1375
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:28,090
This is so fucked up.

1376
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,260
Why?

1377
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,740
Why did you all just watch?

1378
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:46,960
Why did you all watch?

1379
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,000
Oh my god!

1380
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,400
What the fuck?

1381
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,060
Oh my god!

1382
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,180
Does she live?

1383
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,280
No, she is alive!

1384
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,160
Wait, but we saved a lot of dolls!

1385
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,880
We saved a lot of dolls!

1386
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,920
So she can pick up a doll.

1387
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,900
Oh my god, wait!

1388
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,820
I don't know, I didn't read.

1389
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,120
I didn't read.

1390
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,780
I didn't read.

1391
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,180
We didn't study.

1392
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,520
So many dolls, she should be able to find one.

1393
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:37,930
Where is the doll?

1394
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,950
Oh, she is fucked.

1395
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,830
She missed!

1396
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:54,990
Deserved!

1397
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:56,250
Deserved!

1398
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:58,070
Deserved!

1399
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,770
We are gonna be stuck in level 1!

1400
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:07,020
We are gonna be stuck in level 1!

1401
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,250
Why didn't you guys warn me before?

1402
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,880
I thought we were gonna throw bottles at it!

1403
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,120
Also, I need to cut freeload back into the lobby.

1404
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,260
Because the sound is fucked up on my end.

1405
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,240
Why?

1406
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,300
We are back.

1407
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,260
Oh my god.

1408
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,700
The sound is like, extra fucked up for me.

1409
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,560
Oh wait, I didn't mean to.

1410
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,160
I meant to react.

1411
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,080
Can I join?

1412
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,880
Can I join?

1413
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:58,640
Oh, I can.

1414
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,940
Invite me back, please.

1415
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,370
I need to wait for invite.

1416
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,930
I can't believe it.

1417
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:24,610
I can't believe it.

1418
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:29,930
I wanted them to throw bottles at it.

1419
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,130
I wasn't ready.

1420
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,450
Invite me.

1421
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:40,630
Invite me.

1422
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,490
Where is my invite?

1423
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:45,570
What the fuck?

1424
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:47,090
Where is my invite?

1425
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,520
Wait.

1426
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,440
Someone invite me back.

1427
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,060
I forgot to say invite me back.

1428
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,270
No!

1429
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,240
They have to remake the server.

1430
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,300
They can't invite me back.

1431
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,080
I'm gonna restart my game then.

1432
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,500
I'm gonna restart my game.

1433
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,880
That sound was so fucked up when I died.

1434
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,360
When I was in the back rooms.

1435
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,660
The sound was so fucked up.

1436
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,840
Is the sound a lot better?

1437
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,580
Apparently, my sound...

1438
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,400
People try to tell me that the sound was pretty fucked up.

1439
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,020
But I hope it improved.

1440
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,200
The monster destroyed the sound.

1441
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:45,560
Yeah.

1442
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,920
I just don't wanna go back to the back rooms.

1443
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,400
I just don't wanna go back.

1444
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,460
Don't let me go back.

1445
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:00,120
Please.

1446
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,140
I can't go back.

1447
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:08,920
I'm back!

1448
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,780
I'm back!

1449
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,220
When you go to the back rooms, they fuck up your sound.

1450
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,540
Yeah.

1451
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,160
You don't wanna go to the back rooms.

1452
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,780
It's a very scary time.

1453
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,040
I don't wanna go back.

1454
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,880
There might be people loading in now.

1455
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,320
I'm ready.

1456
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:33,660
Ready?

1457
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,500
How does it feel like we've been playing this for 15 hours?

1458
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,260
Only an hour has passed by the way.

1459
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,320
Only an hour.

1460
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,980
And we're still stuck in level 1.

1461
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,200
We know how to...

1462
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,800
Stupid fucking...

1463
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,940
I hate Zort.

1464
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,400
I hate Zort.

1465
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,300
Fuck Zort.

1466
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:03,740
Don't press...

1467
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,660
Guys, press H.

1468
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,880
Guys, press A.

1469
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,940
Wait, how did you do that?

1470
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:16,560
How did you do that?

1471
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,820
Oh, press E.

1472
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,780
Are you a skinwalker?

1473
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,500
Is that you?

1474
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1475
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,600
Alright, I'm ready.

1476
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,800
I'm in.

1477
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,100
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1478
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,300
We speedrun, we speedrun.

1479
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,680
We can do this this time.

1480
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,580
I believe in us.

1481
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,120
I'm grabbing coins.

1482
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,140
I'm waiting for players.

1483
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:05,660
I'm ready, I'm ready.

1484
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,940
Wait, who are we missing?

1485
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,180
We're missing one person.

1486
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,040
Alright, we did it.

1487
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,340
Man.

1488
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,720
I saw...

1489
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,880
I saw him.

1490
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,180
Alright, things should be okay now.

1491
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,260
Alright, I opened.

1492
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,580
It's not the same arcade, right?

1493
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:45,740
No.

1494
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,300
No, no Jimmy.

1495
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,600
I do this one over here.

1496
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:54,520
Not this one.

1497
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:56,300
Nope.

1498
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,260
It has to be this one, right?

1499
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:58,660
No?

1500
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,240
Or maybe this one.

1501
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,220
Oh, 49601.

1502
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,320
49601.

1503
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,580
Alright, nice.

1504
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,940
I got another Rubik's Cube.

1505
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,080
Does anyone have a gas can?

1506
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,220
Who has a gas can?

1507
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,340
Who has a gas can?

1508
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,460
Alright, pick one up.

1509
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,460
Pick one up.

1510
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,380
Alright, someone...

1511
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:45,620
Someone press the button.

1512
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:18,860
Hello.

1513
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,300
I'm safe.

1514
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,340
Snuffy's still alive.

1515
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,320
Which one is the real Snuffy?

1516
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:35,750
Um...

1517
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,090
Um...

1518
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:42,450
Um...

1519
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:43,810
Oh...

1520
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:46,470
Oh...

1521
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:48,730
What's happened?

1522
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:50,090
What's happened?

1523
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,510
Is Snuffy missing again?

1524
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:55,470
Yeah, Snuffy's missing.

1525
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:55,930
Hey.

1526
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,930
Keep your piles closed.

1527
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,130
Spawn faxes didn't die.

1528
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:11,550
Oh, don't worry.

1529
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:12,270
We did too.

1530
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,090
Don't worry.

1531
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:16,310
We also watched Mint get horribly murdered.

1532
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,650
Why did I just die?

1533
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:18,930
What just happened?

1534
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:21,170
How did I just die?

1535
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,350
How did I just die?

1536
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,150
I have a concussion!

1537
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:30,480
I have a concussion!

1538
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,060
She died twice.

1539
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:45,100
She died because the rabbit came over and then the rabbit jumped at her instead of me.

1540
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,960
Wait, which one's the skinwalker?

1541
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:50,960
Is it this one?

1542
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,660
Which one?

1543
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,160
Which one?

1544
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,100
Is that him?

1545
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,700
That's fucking right.

1546
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,140
You're in the wrong neighborhood, buddy.

1547
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:58,900
That's right.

1548
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,700
You're in the fucking wrong neighborhood.

1549
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,720
Get out of here.

1550
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,760
Get out of here.

1551
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:09,790
Wait, how did you trigger it?

1552
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:13,950
How did you trigger the skinwalker?

1553
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:23,770
98.

1554
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,410
Yeah, idiot.

1555
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:33,730
Alright, I'm ready.

1556
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:35,610
Wait, there's another one!

1557
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,450
Oh my god, there's 20 of them!

1558
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,210
Get out of here!

1559
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:39,890
Get out!

1560
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:43,690
Yeah.

1561
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,190
Alright, nice.

1562
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:46,750
I'm in.

1563
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,540
I hid it.

1564
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,540
He seemed fine.

1565
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,600
He didn't eat me.

1566
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah, I don't even know how to jump.

1567
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,040
Okay, I'm gonna grab the saw.

1568
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,320
I grabbed the saw.

1569
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,280
I have the saw on me.

1570
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,100
Oh,

1571
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,420
I wasn't the one that died to the cat.

1572
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,460
I'm helping.

1573
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:27,860
I'm helping.

1574
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:28,260
I'm helping.

1575
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,380
I'm helping.

1576
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,120
There we go.

1577
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,080
Bye, bunny.

1578
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,100
Off to the back rooms you go!

1579
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,960
Oh, fuck!

1580
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:30,550
Oh, Jesus!

1581
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,570
What's this?

1582
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:45,830
What's

1583
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:59,060
this?

1584
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:06,360
Who are you?

1585
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:11,820
Stuffy, is this you?

1586
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,310
Get over here!

1587
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,290
Get over here!

1588
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,180
That's not real.

1589
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:28,380
That's not real.

1590
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:29,920
That's not real.

1591
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:31,920
Oh, that's real.

1592
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,120
No, no, no.

1593
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:42,520
We're all real.

1594
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:42,960
We're all real.

1595
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,000
This is me, Stuffy, and I'm...

1596
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,080
I'm gonna try and get a plushie.

1597
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,280
I'm gonna atone for my sins.

1598
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,980
There's a dude there.

1599
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,980
I'm sorry.

1600
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,980
I'm atoning for my sins.

1601
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:16,880
Mint, is that you?

1602
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,080
That's so funny.

1603
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,780
Why would you do that?

1604
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:31,140
I revived you!

1605
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,300
What did I do wrong?

1606
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,950
What did I do?

1607
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:42,550
Come on, let's go help.

1608
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:58,190
It's right behind us.

1609
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,710
Man's behind me.

1610
01:29:01,190 --> 01:29:01,850
What?

1611
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:03,730
Saw a man.

1612
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:06,770
Don't look at it, I think.

1613
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,400
Oh, they're after them.

1614
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,940
Wait, that's not...

1615
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,560
That's not... I don't know.

1616
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,680
I don't know who that is.

1617
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,180
Oh, there's...

1618
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,520
No?

1619
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:32,780
I don't think so.

1620
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,620
There's no way.

1621
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Wait, everybody's dead.

1622
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,840
We should stay together.

1623
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,500
Wait, where are you?

1624
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:48,260
Hello?

1625
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:02,630
Please no, not again.

1626
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:03,490
Not again.

1627
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:06,430
Not again.

1628
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:07,410
Not again.

1629
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:09,270
Oh, not again.

1630
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,130
No, I'm not looking at binary codes right now.

1631
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,010
Oh no.

1632
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:25,550
Not the binary codes!

1633
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:29,170
Please!

1634
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:31,490
I'm working so hard!

1635
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,070
Just push the drill!

1636
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:34,450
Push the drill!

1637
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,970
I'm looking at binary codes!

1638
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,410
I don't want to go back!

1639
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:43,490
Oh my god.

1640
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:44,090
Please!

1641
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:45,990
I'm looping him!

1642
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:49,670
Oh god.

1643
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:52,730
I don't want to go back.

1644
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:56,130
Don't make me go back.

1645
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:00,050
Oh my god, I'm gaming right now!

1646
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:01,150
Not the numbers!

1647
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:02,770
Not the numbers!

1648
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:04,910
Money.

1649
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:06,290
Oh please.

1650
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:07,070
Oh please.

1651
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:08,630
Please!

1652
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:14,310
I've been stuck on the table!

1653
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,310
Oh my god!

1654
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:20,990
The room is disintegrating!

1655
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:22,950
I'm going crazy!

1656
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:23,350
I can't see!

1657
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:26,510
I can't see!

1658
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,150
I'm looking at Zord for too long!

1659
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:32,750
Oh no.

1660
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,430
Oh no!

1661
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:36,830
It's all unstable!

1662
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:40,630
I'm going mentally ill!

1663
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,130
Oh my god.

1664
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:47,890
I don't think I'm supposed to look at Zord for this long.

1665
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:48,510
No!

1666
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,350
Oh no!

1667
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:53,670
Oh no!

1668
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,710
Oh no!

1669
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:56,310
This is not good!

1670
01:31:56,410 --> 01:32:00,690
This is not looking good for me!

1671
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:01,950
Where did he go?

1672
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:03,250
Where did he go?

1673
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:06,110
I can't see anything anymore!

1674
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:10,620
What happened?

1675
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:11,980
No!

1676
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,100
Not again!

1677
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,680
I went crazy!

1678
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,620
I went...

1679
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:24,000
What happened?

1680
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,720
Did he escape?

1681
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,840
Who's who?

1682
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,300
Where is everybody?

1683
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,080
I'm so confused!

1684
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,500
Who's who?

1685
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,960
I don't know!

1686
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:09,140
Oh no!

1687
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:10,120
Oh no!

1688
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,380
I just got back!

1689
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:13,700
What's...

1690
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,540
What's going on?

1691
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:21,400
I have gas can!

1692
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:21,960
I have gas can!

1693
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,060
Where did I put it?

1694
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,440
I got it!

1695
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:28,760
I got it!

1696
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,440
What else do we need?

1697
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,820
Oh no!

1698
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:56,900
Oh my god!

1699
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:57,400
I'm so dead!

1700
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:05,160
How many vtubers does it take to start a car?

1701
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,680
Oh my god!

1702
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,580
Alright, I clutched that Zord round!

1703
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:17,700
I had Zord chasing me the entire time while you pushed that drill!

1704
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:28,200
I saw binary numbers!

1705
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,140
He was putting numbers on my screen, guys!

1706
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:37,500
We did it!

1707
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,060
We Zorded out!

1708
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,180
We Zorded out of here!

1709
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,860
I would say I was the best bait out there.

1710
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,640
We did it, guys!

1711
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,920
We actually finished episode 1!

1712
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:07,440
It only took us 3 tries, guys!

1713
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,680
It only took us 3 tries!

1714
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,120
But we did it, guys!

1715
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,380
I just wanna play basketball!

1716
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:16,180
I just...

1717
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,280
I just wanna...

1718
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,540
Is this the basketball level now?

1719
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:21,240
Maybe!

1720
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,100
Episode 2 might be basketball level!

1721
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:23,940
Oh!

1722
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,560
Oh, there we go!

1723
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:30,760
Road trip!

1724
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,540
Road trip!

1725
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:44,440
I owe you my life!

1726
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:44,860
Whoa!

1727
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,820
There's 4 of us, though!

1728
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,880
Here in the woods?

1729
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:53,640
Damn!

1730
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,240
Oh, we ran out of gas!

1731
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,840
I'm the one on...

1732
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,920
I'm the one in the van!

1733
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,080
Oh?

1734
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,120
Oh my god, Herbie?

1735
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:18,800
Is that you?

1736
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:27,940
This is...

1737
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:28,280
Oh?

1738
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,900
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1739
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,420
Guys, we gotta run!

1740
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,000
We gotta run!

1741
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,720
We got a car chasing after us!

1742
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:39,380
Guys, we gotta run!

1743
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:39,380
We gotta run!

1744
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:39,380
We got a car chasing after us!

1745
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:39,900
Oh my...

1746
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,320
Wait, I think he ran over...

1747
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,300
Which way do we go?

1748
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,800
Okay, it's just you and I!

1749
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,140
It's just you and me!

1750
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:50,820
Oh, whoa, whoa!

1751
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:51,940
Oh!

1752
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,260
Oh god!

1753
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:00,280
Oh god!

1754
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,680
The car took Snuffy a minute!

1755
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,500
Oh my god, it's just us two!

1756
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,260
We gotta go to Yonkat!

1757
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,880
Don't worry, we can make it!

1758
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:14,620
Don't look back!

1759
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,720
Okay, he's so far.

1760
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,320
Look at him.

1761
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,520
Look at him, look at that.

1762
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,540
Whoa, what you gonna do?

1763
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:22,960
He drove through!

1764
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:23,700
He drove through!

1765
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,380
Oh, he can't drive through!

1766
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,060
Where do I go?

1767
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:28,680
Where do I go?

1768
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,020
I'm not Snuffy, it's Donkey!

1769
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:42,000
Am I dead?

1770
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:48,820
Wait, what happened?

1771
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:51,940
What?

1772
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,460
What happened?

1773
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:57,080
I think Snuffy crashed.

1774
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:58,180
Oh!

1775
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,060
I touched the stone and it was like waiting for players and then nothing happened.

1776
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:08,100
I ran out of the way of the car and then it ran me over somehow, I don't...

1777
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,540
I saw a hole and then I...

1778
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:14,120
One hole in that area and then I...

1779
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,740
I jumped into the hole and I died.

1780
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:23,440
It was glowing!

1781
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,480
No, it was different!

1782
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:26,780
It was different.

1783
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,280
The hole was glowing, guys.

1784
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,540
The hole was glowing, guys.

1785
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,760
It was so different.

1786
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,120
Oh, I can only invite her to watch VBridger.

1787
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,920
Oh my god, no!

1788
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:38,220
Wait, can you not invite her?

1789
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:43,100
Let me see if it's like...

1790
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:43,880
Can you do it, Donkey?

1791
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,040
Because it's registering me as only playing VBridger.

1792
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,280
It says no lobbies for her.

1793
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:50,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1794
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,840
And also she's like a pure...

1795
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,200
I think she's invisible, right?

1796
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,380
How's the sound then?

1797
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,960
I don't know if I should up the volume a little more or not.

1798
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,020
I just wanna play b-ball.

1799
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,000
When do we get b-ball?

1800
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,580
When do we get basketball, guys?

1801
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:12,980
Is their mic okay?

1802
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,120
Or should it be louder?

1803
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:19,230
Wait, I can't...

1804
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:20,410
Oh, it invited me again.

1805
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,260
Louder?

1806
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,000
Were they that quiet before?

1807
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,000
Or was it just now?

1808
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:36,220
Wait, why can't I get in?

1809
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,440
Okay.

1810
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,860
Okay, I'm gonna restart my game.

1811
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,050
Alright.

1812
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,940
Alright, I'll boot up my game.

1813
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,980
I need another invite.

1814
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,540
Game is being weird.

1815
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,300
I might have to...

1816
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:17,120
I might have to go non-invisible.

1817
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:20,400
Game details.

1818
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,820
Friends only.

1819
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,400
There we go.

1820
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:32,450
I just wanna know...

1821
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:35,430
I just wanna know when...

1822
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,690
Oh, everyone has been quiet for a while.

1823
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:38,990
Sound guy!

1824
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:42,930
No!

1825
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:43,190
No!

1826
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:52,350
I can't seem to join.

1827
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:01,360
I'll boost him up a bit then.

1828
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:08,500
Okay.

1829
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,960
I have been banned from Dave and Busters.

1830
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:22,540
I went non-invisible too.

1831
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,420
But yeah, I'm not getting invited too.

1832
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,660
Wait, where's Mint?

1833
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,200
Oh, Mint.

1834
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:29,920
Reboot.

1835
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,920
Reboot the game.

1836
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1837
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,620
Mint is showing as VTS.

1838
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:44,600
Alright.

1839
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:48,680
Yeah, sometimes, I think when I'm in the back rooms...

1840
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,520
It like, makes the sound super weird.

1841
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,460
Yeah, the audio bugs.

1842
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,580
I boosted everybody up higher though.

1843
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,680
Just to hope that works.

1844
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,680
Yeah, now she's zording.

1845
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,280
Okay, now that Mint is zording...

1846
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,940
We should be able to get her in.

1847
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,480
She's zording now.

1848
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:12,040
Yeah!

1849
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,480
I hate the back rooms so much.

1850
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,140
I hate it.

1851
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,080
Let me know if the sound gets better in this new one.

1852
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:27,980
I'm here.

1853
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:30,580
Yeah?

1854
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,640
I always wanted a brother.

1855
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,300
I always wanted a brother.

1856
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,060
Just like you.

1857
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,740
I always wanted a brother.

1858
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,700
I always wanted a brother.

1859
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,640
I always wanted a brother.

1860
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,100
Just like you.

1861
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:58,820
We're harmonizing.

1862
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:01,260
Beautiful.

1863
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,320
There's new stuff to get in here.

1864
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,540
Yeah, let's surround where Snuffy will be with the...

1865
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:14,180
Have you found that the directional audio is sometimes really weird?

1866
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:14,920
Yeah.

1867
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:15,940
Sometimes it's like...

1868
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,740
When you get really close and it'll be like, no, you can't hear them.

1869
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,960
When you get in the back rooms...

1870
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,300
When you get in the back rooms...

1871
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:24,520
It like, fucks up your audio.

1872
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,520
And everybody sounds like they're in like...

1873
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,220
You're in like a hole somewhere.

1874
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:34,660
I think it was Snuffy went to the back rooms.

1875
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,640
Oh, hey, Snuffy's here.

1876
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,000
Praise be to Snuffy.

1877
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,660
Praise be to Snuffy.

1878
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,620
Praise be to Snuffy.

1879
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,520
Praise be to Snuffy.

1880
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:49,620
Praise be to Snuffy.

1881
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,340
Praise be to Snuffy.

1882
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:50,640
Praise be to Snuffy.

1883
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:54,080
Alright, are you guys ready to get eaten by a car?

1884
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:55,540
Yeah.

1885
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,760
I turned my graphics into potato mode.

1886
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,140
I'm ready.

1887
01:43:59,060 --> 01:43:59,680
Let's do it.

1888
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,520
Alright, let's go.

1889
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:08,450
Bum, bum, bum.

1890
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:13,490
Bum, bum, bum.

1891
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:15,970
Okay, we all touch a rock.

1892
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:18,370
Touch the rock.

1893
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:20,190
Don't go into any holes, guys.

1894
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,810
There's a hole that can kill you.

1895
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:24,530
Alright, I skipped.

1896
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:25,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1897
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:29,190
No!

1898
01:44:30,190 --> 01:44:31,150
There's three of us!

1899
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:34,310
Yeah, I wonder if it's the car level.

1900
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:38,710
Yeah, yeah, maybe we'll see.

1901
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:40,050
Okay, still left.

1902
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:40,670
Go to the left.

1903
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:42,890
Go to the left.

1904
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:45,510
Min, are you still alive?

1905
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:48,810
She's still alive.

1906
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:49,490
It's fine.

1907
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:50,870
It's fine.

1908
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:55,290
Yeah, we got this.

1909
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:58,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1910
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:01,790
We know the exact way.

1911
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:04,950
Don't worry, the car is really slow.

1912
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:06,730
Woo!

1913
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,740
Bum, bum, bum.

1914
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,120
Bum, bum, bum.

1915
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:15,300
Bum, bum, bum.

1916
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,140
Touch the rock!

1917
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:16,700
Touch the rock!

1918
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:19,900
Touching rock!

1919
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:22,360
Touching rock!

1920
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,460
Run where?

1921
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,240
Run where?

1922
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,840
Oh, here!

1923
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,360
Oh, not the hole!

1924
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,420
We did it!

1925
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,080
Okay, let's see if we can invite her.

1926
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,880
Should we try to re-invite Snuffy?

1927
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:43,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1928
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,340
Let's try to re-invite Snuffy.

1929
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,320
No!

1930
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,100
Wait, it says invite friends here.

1931
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,360
Oh, wait, no.

1932
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,080
Oh, no.

1933
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,680
I don't think she can do car level.

1934
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:57,500
Unless, like...

1935
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,300
Unless she can turn her graphics even harder.

1936
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,000
Even further back.

1937
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,620
There's no going back.

1938
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:05,300
There's no going further than potato.

1939
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:06,300
No!

1940
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:08,640
There's the basketball court!

1941
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,480
No!

1942
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:24,370
No!

1943
01:46:32,290 --> 01:46:32,770
No!

1944
01:46:36,410 --> 01:46:37,090
Me too!

1945
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:42,490
Okay, no, no, it's fine.

1946
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:43,510
No, no, we try again.

1947
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:45,650
We try the car level again.

1948
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:47,390
So we can get her in.

1949
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,750
Should we try one more time?

1950
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,210
Yeah, let's try one more time.

1951
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:55,510
Yeah, the running part's not very long, too.

1952
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:57,090
Hello?

1953
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:58,410
Hello?

1954
01:46:59,150 --> 01:46:59,890
Who's that?

1955
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,710
Oh, it's a shop!

1956
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:03,770
Oh, it is!

1957
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:06,470
Oh!

1958
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:08,170
What's this?

1959
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:09,550
There's a fist.

1960
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:13,310
Where did he go?

1961
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:14,930
What just happened?

1962
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:15,790
I don't know.

1963
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:16,850
He just...

1964
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:17,650
He exploded!

1965
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:22,810
Okay, guys, we have to go back to the main menu and invite Snuffy back.

1966
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:24,270
I have to play ball.

1967
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:25,890
We do.

1968
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:27,410
I gotta be ball.

1969
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:29,610
Okay, alright, Snuffy.

1970
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,910
Bye, car.

1971
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,370
Bye, everyone!

1972
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:36,190
Return to lobby!

1973
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:41,410
We need the ball.

1974
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:43,150
Alright, invite Snuffy.

1975
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:48,720
Game is not paused for real?

1976
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,980
Yeah, you can't pause in a multiplayer.

1977
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,300
Yeah.

1978
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,780
We might have to restart the lobby.

1979
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:56,080
It's so finicky.

1980
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:56,720
I don't know.

1981
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:05,420
I must play b-ball!

1982
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,980
Let me play!

1983
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:15,860
That's all I want!

1984
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,540
All I wanna do is play basketball!

1985
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:22,180
We will b-ball!

1986
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:29,600
I'm back.

1987
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,380
We will b-ball!

1988
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,440
Wait.

1989
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:41,920
Wait a minute.

1990
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,500
What are you doing to me?

1991
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:54,830
Lay down in bed!

1992
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:57,310
Join us!

1993
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:17,380
What was that?

1994
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,400
You know what to do.

1995
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,840
Stop it, man!

1996
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,240
Stop it!

1997
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,420
You're ruining it!

1998
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:32,860
You're ruining it!

1999
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:36,620
Snuffy!

2000
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,020
Snuffy!

2001
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:00,710
Snuffy in the corner!

2002
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:06,950
Snuffy, go stand up beside the bed.

2003
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:10,070
Like in the corner.

2004
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:12,710
Snuffy just likes to watch.

2005
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:17,190
He's got the chair.

2006
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:18,770
Snuffy in the corner!

2007
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,820
This is what sorting is all about, guys.

2008
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:37,160
This is what sorting is all about.

2009
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:41,660
This will throw off the skinwalkers.

2010
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:42,620
Yeah!

2011
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:46,080
Skinwalkers don't got we got.

2012
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:48,600
That's right.

2013
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:52,900
This time, we got the car.

2014
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:54,700
We got the car, Snuffy.

2015
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:57,000
Be careful until it crashes.

2016
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,300
What if Snuffy hoes next time?

2017
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:03,900
Maybe if Snuffy hoes.

2018
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,100
Oh, that's true.

2019
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:09,800
Alright.

2020
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,280
Oh, there's four of us.

2021
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,380
There's four of us in here.

2022
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:20,320
I see four of us in the car.

2023
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:27,880
Oh, no.

2024
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:28,940
She's still there.

2025
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:29,500
I see her.

2026
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,320
Keep talking, Snuffy.

2027
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,620
Keep talking so we know you're alive.

2028
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,100
Oh, my God.

2029
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,120
We get people!

2030
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:53,450
Oh, my God.

2031
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:54,150
Let's go.

2032
01:51:54,970 --> 01:51:57,070
We're gonna Minecraft with the Youngscast.

2033
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:03,430
To the right, to the right, to the right.

2034
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:06,550
To the right, to the right, to the left.

2035
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:08,150
To the left.

2036
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:10,030
Just follow us.

2037
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:12,010
Let us know if you're still alive.

2038
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:15,750
Touch the stone, touch the stone.

2039
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:18,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2040
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:21,150
Don't go into any holes.

2041
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2042
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:28,430
Do we all touch it?

2043
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:35,350
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2044
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:36,990
Oh, my God.

2045
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:38,010
How did you figure that out?

2046
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:39,550
I would've died horribly so many times.

2047
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:42,110
Oh, here we go.

2048
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:44,370
We made it.

2049
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:46,330
Oh, my God.

2050
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:47,410
We get people!

2051
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,190
Oh, my God.

2052
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:52,490
Guys.

2053
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:57,210
We can play basketball.

2054
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:00,870
Don't worry.

2055
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:04,650
I'm here for the most important game of all.

2056
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:09,650
Did you guys know?

2057
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:12,090
That I'm the baller?

2058
01:53:13,650 --> 01:53:15,410
That's right.

2059
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,370
No!

2060
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:20,950
She's gone.

2061
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:22,130
No!

2062
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:23,810
I missed it.

2063
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:27,970
We just made it!

2064
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:30,190
No way!

2065
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:32,750
I'll miss her.

2066
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:35,050
We just made it, too!

2067
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:37,050
That's right.

2068
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:40,030
That's right.

2069
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:44,310
I missed.

2070
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:46,030
I don't know the...

2071
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:47,450
Guys, it's been a while, guys.

2072
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:49,710
Oh, my God.

2073
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:50,790
What the fuck, guys?

2074
01:53:50,830 --> 01:53:51,630
It's been a while.

2075
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:53,950
Yeah.

2076
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:55,810
What?

2077
01:53:58,210 --> 01:54:00,030
Don't give me my ball back.

2078
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:01,390
No, no, no.

2079
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:02,610
Is that storm getting closer?

2080
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:04,410
Is it the storm that is approaching?

2081
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:07,010
Wait, there he is.

2082
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:08,410
Wait!

2083
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:09,950
How did you get it in?

2084
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:12,630
Wait a minute!

2085
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:12,970
Okay.

2086
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,770
The basketball, baby!

2087
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:16,810
That's right.

2088
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:18,970
I scored on my own basket, but that's okay.

2089
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:20,270
I was testing something out.

2090
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:21,970
That's right.

2091
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:25,910
What does the button do?

2092
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:27,070
Wait, what?

2093
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:28,070
How did you steal it?

2094
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:30,890
No!

2095
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:35,070
Oh, my God.

2096
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:36,470
Back to defense.

2097
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:39,250
I'm going to do a three-pointer.

2098
01:54:39,390 --> 01:54:40,150
Watch this.

2099
01:54:41,490 --> 01:54:42,610
Okay, I...

2100
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:45,110
Did you just hear a scream of agony?

2101
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:47,430
No, I'm playing meatball.

2102
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:48,850
Okay.

2103
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:50,470
How is the...

2104
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:51,910
What is the power meter?

2105
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:55,310
I'm getting cooked right now.

2106
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:58,010
I don't know the power meter of this fucking...

2107
01:54:58,010 --> 01:54:59,750
of this fucking basketball.

2108
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:02,330
Okay.

2109
01:55:02,490 --> 01:55:03,510
Watch this.

2110
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:06,690
This is going to be the shot of the century.

2111
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:10,690
Oh, my God.

2112
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,870
I did it.

2113
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:14,870
I did it.

2114
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:18,530
Oh, my God.

2115
01:55:18,570 --> 01:55:19,710
I'm doing it again.

2116
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:25,790
I'm doing it.

2117
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:28,670
Guys, I'm figuring it out.

2118
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,240
I'm so sad.

2119
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:36,600
All I wanted to do was play meatball.

2120
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:39,200
I'm winning.

2121
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:43,600
I'm winning.

2122
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,960
I'm doing it.

2123
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:48,880
Guys.

2124
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:57,760
Yeah, go fund me for Snuffy's meatball PC so we can play basketball.

2125
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:02,040
Go fund me so we can play basketball with Snuffy.

2126
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,280
Here, I'm passing it to you.

2127
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:07,460
Catch.

2128
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:10,720
That's right.

2129
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:11,960
And I'm going to steal it.

2130
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:14,140
How are you faster than me?

2131
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:15,480
Dirt.

2132
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:22,860
Take that.

2133
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:23,420
Whoa.

2134
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:25,940
Whoa.

2135
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:26,940
Oh, shit.

2136
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:32,200
That's right.

2137
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:33,000
Defense.

2138
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:33,500
Defense.

2139
01:56:42,610 --> 01:56:44,330
Wait, what's his name?

2140
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:46,790
This guy.

2141
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:49,250
Yeah, yeah.

2142
01:56:50,590 --> 01:56:51,450
I don't know.

2143
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:55,910
There's a lot of things in this game where there seems to be no point.

2144
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:57,150
Like basketball.

2145
01:56:57,890 --> 01:57:00,790
I love you, Snuffy, listening to us from behind.

2146
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,350
Snuffy, we miss you.

2147
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:02,890
Snuffy.

2148
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:07,410
Go fund me for Snuffy's PC, guys.

2149
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:11,290
It's such a beautiful night for Snuffy.

2150
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:13,990
Snuffy.

2151
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:14,870
Snuffy.

2152
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:16,950
Snuffy.

2153
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:22,690
Come back, Snuffy.

2154
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:26,710
Snuffy.

2155
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:27,530
Snuffy.

2156
01:57:33,970 --> 01:57:34,670
Okay.

2157
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:37,070
Okay.

2158
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:39,770
We're ending the moment there.

2159
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:40,930
Okay.

2160
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:46,090
We miss you, Snuffy.

2161
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,390
We miss you, Snuffy.

2162
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:51,050
Let's go back to the lobby, guys.

2163
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:53,070
Let's go back to the lobby.

2164
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:54,730
We can't do this without her.

2165
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:56,730
I think we have to finish.

2166
01:57:56,930 --> 01:58:02,110
People were saying you can B-ball in the lobby, but I think you have to beat episode 2 to unlock the basketball court.

2167
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:04,010
Yeah.

2168
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:05,510
Alright, Snuffy.

2169
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:08,990
The moment your PC is fixed, we're all coming back here for basketball.

2170
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:15,770
I'm gonna watch.

2171
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:16,330
Do it.

2172
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:17,530
Don't be a pussy.

2173
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:20,990
Don't be a pussy.

2174
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:21,230
Wait.

2175
01:58:21,310 --> 01:58:21,370
Wait.

2176
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,990
Wait.

2177
01:58:22,210 --> 01:58:25,150
Before you do it, you should grab a basketball.

2178
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:26,370
Oh, never mind.

2179
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:32,170
Yeah, I think you have to move off.

2180
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:38,110
Oh,

2181
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:41,670
my God.

2182
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:43,970
They turned Min into a Rubik's Cube.

2183
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,010
Funniest shit ever.

2184
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:49,290
Guys, I'm gonna steal her identity now.

2185
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:51,050
Guys, I'm gonna dox her a Steam ID.

2186
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:56,630
Is it actually a Steam ID?

2187
01:58:56,730 --> 01:59:00,790
Yeah, it would be a shame if I show her a Steam ID right now.

2188
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:03,390
Oh, hey, you're back.

2189
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:04,190
He's back.

2190
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:07,450
Oh, he went into the background.

2191
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:09,410
Yeah, it's kind of awkward.

2192
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:10,110
Oh, here he comes.

2193
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,090
Don't touch it and see what happens.

2194
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:14,310
Yeah, what does he do?

2195
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:19,050
Hey, buddy.

2196
01:59:19,730 --> 01:59:22,230
Aww, he's cute.

2197
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:30,730
What if he's actually a horrible betrayer?

2198
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:31,970
Skinwalker.

2199
01:59:32,370 --> 01:59:33,090
There's a Skinwalker.

2200
01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:34,130
That could be Snuffy.

2201
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:35,990
It's not Snuffy.

2202
01:59:36,110 --> 01:59:36,830
That could be Snuffy.

2203
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:40,750
Snuffy, I'm gonna take you to the back.

2204
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:42,690
Come on, get over here.

2205
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:47,990
Get over here.

2206
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,710
Get out of here.

2207
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:49,950
Get out.

2208
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:52,250
You should push him onto a mine or something.

2209
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:54,050
There's a mine on the other side of the basketball court.

2210
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:54,970
Oh, is there?

2211
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,330
Yeah.

2212
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:59,910
It's over this way.

2213
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:02,550
Alright.

2214
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,250
Come follow me, me, me, me.

2215
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:05,110
Me!

2216
02:00:05,690 --> 02:00:09,450
Why does the Mimic have a...

2217
02:00:09,450 --> 02:00:10,510
have a flashlight?

2218
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:13,450
It's because he's smarter than us.

2219
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:16,170
Wait, is this a trampoline?

2220
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:17,710
Yes.

2221
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:22,290
Is this...

2222
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:22,830
Are you real?

2223
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:25,650
Yeah, I'm real.

2224
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:26,270
Are you real?

2225
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:27,590
Oh, wait, is it...

2226
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:27,930
Oh, yeah.

2227
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:30,570
Alright, don't worry.

2228
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:32,090
Wait, he died.

2229
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:34,870
Oh, he died.

2230
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:39,730
What even is in this house, anyway?

2231
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:43,990
What's in here?

2232
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:47,310
Oh.

2233
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:51,430
I mean, there's nothing weird about this house.

2234
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:54,410
This house looks perfectly safe.

2235
02:00:56,970 --> 02:00:58,630
Just a lot of mines.

2236
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,240
This house is so safe.

2237
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,660
Like, nothing to worry about at all.

2238
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:10,380
Wait, what's this?

2239
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:18,220
Oh, my God.

2240
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:20,330
I'm a musical genius.

2241
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:27,440
Oh.

2242
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:29,420
Wait, what happened?

2243
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:30,460
What?

2244
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:33,140
No, I was gonna show...

2245
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:35,880
I was gonna show you guys a guitar!

2246
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:45,820
I was gonna show you guys a guitar!

2247
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:50,290
I'm sad.

2248
02:01:51,670 --> 02:01:53,210
The game zorded me out.

2249
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:55,910
I rocked too hard.

2250
02:01:56,010 --> 02:01:57,670
The music was too good.

2251
02:01:58,230 --> 02:01:59,970
I found a guitar!

2252
02:02:00,930 --> 02:02:01,870
I was gonna jam!

2253
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:04,770
And then the lobby disappeared!

2254
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:07,670
I was gonna rock out!

2255
02:02:09,490 --> 02:02:10,210
Where's Stuffy?

2256
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:15,770
Is she rebooting her PC right now?

2257
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:20,170
She got zorded out.

2258
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:25,710
She got zorded out.

2259
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:29,710
I think she should close Discord.

2260
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:32,830
So, I was playing Henry Stickmin the other day...

2261
02:02:32,830 --> 02:02:35,230
and there was like a weird glitch...

2262
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:35,950
where it...

2263
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:37,990
where it, like...

2264
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:40,570
kept breaking the game if I had Discord open.

2265
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:41,550
Oh, that's weird.

2266
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:44,090
I mean, we're gonna be...

2267
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:45,030
Oh, wait, you caught it.

2268
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:45,950
Wait, I can catch it?

2269
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:46,550
Oh, I can.

2270
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:49,790
Alright, 2v2 basketball.

2271
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:51,030
See you in the courts.

2272
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:54,170
Wait, turn around?

2273
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:58,430
You fucker.

2274
02:03:02,850 --> 02:03:04,450
I think she left.

2275
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:05,430
I don't know.

2276
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:07,110
Wait, she's not streaming anymore?

2277
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:10,090
Is she not streaming?

2278
02:03:10,410 --> 02:03:12,570
She said she could try one more time...

2279
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:14,650
and I was like 3 minutes late to seeing that message...

2280
02:03:14,650 --> 02:03:15,730
so she might have just given up.

2281
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:16,490
No!

2282
02:03:18,610 --> 02:03:19,090
No!

2283
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:20,710
At least she's still alive.

2284
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,410
One last ride, Snuffy!

2285
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:30,710
One last ride!

2286
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:34,150
They locked up the basketball court.

2287
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:35,930
I can't believe it.

2288
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:38,630
Oh, she's done?

2289
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:41,570
She saw my message...

2290
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:42,010
so she's coming.

2291
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:47,170
I went and creeped on her stream.

2292
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:47,650
I heard her.

2293
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:50,850
Come back.

2294
02:03:51,010 --> 02:03:53,710
Let's make a shrine for her.

2295
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:55,690
Yeah, right here.

2296
02:03:56,230 --> 02:03:57,730
She's gonna spawn right here.

2297
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:08,950
I believe in her.

2298
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:12,290
Snuffy, we're all here for you.

2299
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:16,550
Snuffy, praise be!

2300
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:20,350
Praise be!

2301
02:04:21,370 --> 02:04:22,670
We're here to Zort.

2302
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:28,870
We're here to Zort.

2303
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:30,610
Zort!

2304
02:04:31,050 --> 02:04:31,850
The Snuffy!

2305
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,030
The almighty Snuffy!

2306
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:38,490
Wait, did you send an invite to her?

2307
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,770
I sent her a couple, yeah.

2308
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:42,530
Okay, okay.

2309
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:45,770
Oh, dude!

2310
02:04:45,870 --> 02:04:49,270
If you turn the camera down, there's a really weird crotch seam on the model.

2311
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:51,670
I don't see it.

2312
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:53,250
I don't see it.

2313
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:53,670
No?

2314
02:04:54,130 --> 02:04:55,950
It's like a melded seam.

2315
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:57,710
I don't see it.

2316
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:59,790
Oh, I see my ass.

2317
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:01,870
Oh my god!

2318
02:05:02,710 --> 02:05:04,870
Oh my god, do you see his ass?

2319
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:07,250
It's like ribbed.

2320
02:05:07,570 --> 02:05:07,990
Whoa!

2321
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:10,950
That's what I mean!

2322
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:14,150
I was not expecting...

2323
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:16,730
I was not expecting Zort to be...

2324
02:05:16,730 --> 02:05:18,590
To be packing up there.

2325
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:19,810
Or down there.

2326
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:23,110
Damn, no wonder he does this.

2327
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:27,490
Wait, let me see.

2328
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:36,390
Praise be!

2329
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:37,190
Hello!

2330
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:40,210
Hi!

2331
02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:42,850
Hello, I have come back.

2332
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:44,110
Welcome back!

2333
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:46,690
We were so close to b-ball!

2334
02:05:48,230 --> 02:05:48,710
I know.

2335
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:51,170
Okay, I'm completely naked now.

2336
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:53,190
This is my last resort.

2337
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:54,310
Okay.

2338
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:55,190
I believe.

2339
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:57,350
I believe.

2340
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:00,290
Zorting in the nude, let's go!

2341
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:02,030
That's how our parents did it.

2342
02:06:05,690 --> 02:06:07,030
Alright, skip time.

2343
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:11,150
We're skipping, we're skipping.

2344
02:06:11,450 --> 02:06:11,570
Alright.

2345
02:06:12,090 --> 02:06:12,970
Snuffy, are you still here?

2346
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:15,490
We're running, we're running, we're running.

2347
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:19,750
Snuffy's just gonna have to make noise constantly so we know.

2348
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:20,990
So we know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2349
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:22,610
We'll be like, Snuffy live check!

2350
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:24,050
Snuffy live check!

2351
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:27,790
Jump!

2352
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:30,490
Mic check 1, 2, 3!

2353
02:06:30,610 --> 02:06:32,010
Mic check 1, 2, 3!

2354
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:38,390
Mic check 1, 2, 3!

2355
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:41,370
I'm jumping and I'm jumping!

2356
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:43,230
I missed my...

2357
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:43,490
Guys!

2358
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,410
Guys!

2359
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:47,470
I did not make it.

2360
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:50,390
I did not make it to the bathroom.

2361
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:57,840
She probably went to the bathroom.

2362
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:58,920
She probably went to the bathroom.

2363
02:06:59,440 --> 02:06:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2364
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:03,220
Yeah, it was an intentional fall.

2365
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:08,700
Touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it!

2366
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:09,640
I'm running!

2367
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:12,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2368
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,800
Uh, surely I'm gonna live through this.

2369
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:15,300
How did...

2370
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:17,720
How did I get into another hole?

2371
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:20,100
How do I...

2372
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,000
How did I...

2373
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,780
How did I get to another hole?

2374
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:27,180
How did I...

2375
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:28,500
How did I...

2376
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,160
How did I get to another hole?

2377
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:32,000
How did I...

2378
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,480
Oh my god!

2379
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:43,780
I'm back!

2380
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:44,580
Let's go!

2381
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,680
It's time to B-Ball!

2382
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:50,760
It's time to B-Ball!

2383
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:52,960
Oh my...

2384
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:53,900
Praise B!

2385
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,140
Alright, teams, let's...

2386
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:59,820
Let's get in the teams, everybody!

2387
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:01,680
Alright!

2388
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:04,620
Skins and shirts.

2389
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:06,660
Okay, we can't tell.

2390
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,200
Who are you?

2391
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:09,440
Who are you?

2392
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,280
Okay, this is...

2393
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:13,000
Okay, um...

2394
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,380
I don't know how we tell who's who.

2395
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,360
Oh, what the fuck?

2396
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:18,340
Hey, hey, hey!

2397
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:20,260
Who are you?

2398
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:20,840
Who's this?

2399
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:25,130
Okay, okay.

2400
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:26,010
I'm part of your team!

2401
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:26,710
I'm part of your team!

2402
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:27,970
This is me!

2403
02:08:28,110 --> 02:08:28,430
This is me!

2404
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:28,890
I'm jumping!

2405
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:30,250
Don't let him steal this!

2406
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:30,630
No!

2407
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:33,970
How could you let me just take that from you?

2408
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:35,150
I got it!

2409
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:35,470
I got it!

2410
02:08:35,570 --> 02:08:35,910
I got it!

2411
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:40,450
Oh my god!

2412
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:41,950
No!

2413
02:08:46,070 --> 02:08:46,550
No!

2414
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:49,770
We were so close!

2415
02:08:51,150 --> 02:08:51,630
No!

2416
02:08:53,570 --> 02:08:55,430
I dribbled past her!

2417
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:57,170
Yeah!

2418
02:08:59,450 --> 02:09:02,650
Even the little ball is mourning.

2419
02:09:03,330 --> 02:09:03,630
Me!

2420
02:09:05,210 --> 02:09:05,710
Me!

2421
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,290
Yeah, I know, little guy!

2422
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:12,310
We will...

2423
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:17,050
Guys, go fund me for Snuffy's PC so we can B-ball.

2424
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:18,850
Alright.

2425
02:09:19,310 --> 02:09:21,010
She would want this, guys.

2426
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:22,610
Guys, she would want this.

2427
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:24,310
She would want this.

2428
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:26,670
Guys, she would want this.

2429
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:27,850
She wants us to twerk on her?

2430
02:09:27,930 --> 02:09:29,590
Yes, she would want this.

2431
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:30,230
Right?

2432
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:35,870
Good morning!

2433
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:36,790
Good morning!

2434
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:39,050
Good morning, Snuffy!

2435
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:41,670
For Snuffy!

2436
02:09:42,170 --> 02:09:43,250
For Snuffy!

2437
02:09:44,490 --> 02:09:45,090
Snuffy!

2438
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:49,210
We're doing it for you, Snuffy!

2439
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:51,170
What the fuck?

2440
02:09:51,210 --> 02:09:52,670
There's two of them now!

2441
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:54,610
There's another ball!

2442
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:55,990
Snuffy!

2443
02:09:57,130 --> 02:10:00,110
I'm expecting these things to explode or something.

2444
02:10:01,530 --> 02:10:03,130
We could just twerk until we die.

2445
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:08,530
We're basically Kesho.

2446
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:10,950
We're just partying until we die.

2447
02:10:13,230 --> 02:10:15,170
That's a party over there.

2448
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:19,750
At least they're all so sad for her, too.

2449
02:10:25,490 --> 02:10:30,810
I hope she knows that we're twerking for her in memoriam.

2450
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:32,390
In memoriam, Snuffy.

2451
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:37,010
2025 to 2025.

2452
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:48,830
We're going out in style.

2453
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:51,670
Let's all stand in the mines and die for her.

2454
02:10:51,670 --> 02:10:52,890
And then we'll call it there.

2455
02:11:02,050 --> 02:11:03,630
It was nice.

2456
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:13,590
3, 2, 1...

2457
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:19,130
Why is it always me?

2458
02:11:19,930 --> 02:11:22,050
Why is it always me?

2459
02:11:24,430 --> 02:11:25,310
Hello?

2460
02:11:26,290 --> 02:11:30,150
Why is it always me in the back rooms?

2461
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:33,850
Why is it always me?

2462
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:40,070
Hello?

2463
02:11:44,590 --> 02:11:45,990
Oh, are you in the back rooms?

2464
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:49,430
What?

2465
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:52,330
What?

2466
02:11:52,710 --> 02:11:54,630
Back at it again.

2467
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:02,290
You leave and then maybe it'll trigger it.

2468
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:08,830
3...

2469
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:10,710
She's back in the back.

2470
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:12,310
How'd she get in?

2471
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:14,130
That was the weirdest back rooms I've ever been in.

2472
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:22,970
They really do act so realistic, don't they?

2473
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:24,890
They act just like me.

2474
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:32,450
I'm guessing Lime died and left.

2475
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:34,690
Yeah, she did.

2476
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:37,530
No, no, I'm alive, I'm alive.

2477
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:38,730
I'm gonna be the only one here.

2478
02:12:39,290 --> 02:12:41,330
Mint, the last remaining twerker.

2479
02:12:45,230 --> 02:12:49,110
I ain't gonna lie, but I don't think it gets to actually kill one person per explosion.

2480
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:50,710
Does it actually?

2481
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:52,910
No, no, I got killed too.

2482
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:54,410
But I got sent to the back rooms.

2483
02:12:55,390 --> 02:12:55,650
Oh.

2484
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:58,170
Yeah, it's just Mint was too far off.

2485
02:12:58,590 --> 02:13:00,350
Only one person needs to...

2486
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:02,870
I will refrain until we can all play together.

2487
02:13:05,230 --> 02:13:06,110
I will refrain.

2488
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:06,930
Return to lobby.

2489
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:11,610
Return to lobby.

2490
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:19,250
Snuffy should get back here so we can just say goodbye together.

2491
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:23,470
Do you think Snuffy can come back and just say goodbye?

2492
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:26,070
We'll do the second one when Snuffy fixes her computer.

2493
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:26,950
Yeah, yeah.

2494
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:30,170
I believe...

2495
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,090
I believe...

2496
02:13:31,090 --> 02:13:32,190
Wait, there's a cat up here.

2497
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:34,270
Yeah, we saw a cat in the beginning.

2498
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:35,950
For Snuffy, guys.

2499
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:36,950
For Snuffy.

2500
02:13:39,430 --> 02:13:40,710
For Snuffy.

2501
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:42,430
For Snuffy.

2502
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,290
Goodbye, Snuffy.

2503
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:44,810
Goodbye, Snuffy.

2504
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:49,710
Don't worry, we'll be back when your PC is fixed.

2505
02:13:49,870 --> 02:13:50,510
Bye, guys.

2506
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:52,590
Bye, bye.

2507
02:13:52,810 --> 02:13:54,010
It was fun.

2508
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:56,950
Bye, bye.

2509
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:01,050
Bye.

2510
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:05,530
That was fun.

2511
02:14:05,770 --> 02:14:08,090
It's sad that Snuffy's PC crashed.

2512
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:09,350
Oh, I'm still in.

2513
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:10,430
I'm still here.

2514
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:13,890
I guess she's still in here, too.

2515
02:14:17,490 --> 02:14:18,330
Oh, man.

2516
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:19,730
That sucks, though.

2517
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:22,210
I don't know what it is about the b-ball.

2518
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:25,490
I guess the b-ball map was too high-res.

2519
02:14:26,990 --> 02:14:27,610
That's all.

2520
02:14:28,490 --> 02:14:30,250
That's all I could think about.

2521
02:14:30,370 --> 02:14:32,470
The b-ball map was just too much.

2522
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:35,290
There was just too much balling going on there.

2523
02:14:36,770 --> 02:14:41,630
Yeah, but whenever Snuffy's PC is fixed, we'll definitely try it.

2524
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:43,470
We'll definitely do a part two of this game.

2525
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:46,730
It was really fun, though.

2526
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:47,750
It was really fun.

2527
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:52,330
It's just unfortunate that her PC couldn't handle it in the end.

2528
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:56,830
But I hope in the future we can play part two again.

2529
02:14:57,470 --> 02:14:58,170
But, yeah.

2530
02:14:58,410 --> 02:15:04,490
Also, the stream's not ending because I'm here to give away some Monster Hunter codes!

2531
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:08,470
I don't know if I can do the nightbot thing.

2532
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:11,970
I'm gonna see if I can do the nightbot thing because that was awkward.

2533
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:22,790
Nightbot started timing out every- It timed out 206 people when we- Jesus Christ.

2534
02:15:23,110 --> 02:15:27,210
It timed out 206 people.

2535
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:29,210
Oh my go- I'm sorry.

2536
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:31,390
I am so sorry.

2537
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:34,170
I'm gonna turn things off.

2538
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:34,550
Okay.

2539
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:38,610
It's because of excessive symbols and- Okay.

2540
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:41,030
I think it should be okay now.

2541
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:46,490
I'm inviting nightbot back in if anybody wants to test it out.

2542
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:52,390
Nightbot is now back in, so it should be okay now.

2543
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:53,710
I think.

2544
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:54,710
Alright.

2545
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:56,250
I hope so.

2546
02:15:56,710 --> 02:15:59,450
Disabled, disabled, disabled.

2547
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:00,370
Alright.

2548
02:16:00,770 --> 02:16:02,650
I think it should be okay.

2549
02:16:03,070 --> 02:16:07,210
I - Alright.

2550
02:16:07,710 --> 02:16:08,210
So!

2551
02:16:09,490 --> 02:16:22,630
I was given several codes for the Monster Hunter Wilds launch and a huge shoutout to MSI for sponsoring Monster Hunter Wilds launch.

2552
02:16:23,410 --> 02:16:27,650
Monster Hunter- Capcom actually sent me a package too, like creator package.

2553
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:40,270
By the way, I was very surprised at both the sponsor and the creator package because um, uh, because the last time I played Monster Hunter was the 2007 Monster Hunter PSP game.

2554
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:50,870
So I was not expecting myself to like you know, get sponsored by to like to do anything Monster Hunter related.

2555
02:16:51,490 --> 02:17:03,750
So, very huge shoutout and uh, thank you to um, basically to Monster Hunter for um, oh there's a reason why.

2556
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:04,650
Okay, required level.

2557
02:17:05,170 --> 02:17:08,290
Let's see, uh, let's do like everyone.

2558
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:10,510
I'll update it to everyone, see if that works.

2559
02:17:11,230 --> 02:17:13,070
Uh, alright.

2560
02:17:13,430 --> 02:17:15,210
Can you guys do the- use the command now?

2561
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:17,410
Does anyone fucking know?

2562
02:17:17,510 --> 02:17:19,230
I don't know how to use nightbot apparently.

2563
02:17:19,590 --> 02:17:23,450
Uh, it says it's online.

2564
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:25,610
Oh my god.

2565
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:27,490
Oh my god.

2566
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:28,350
Okay, guys.

2567
02:17:28,470 --> 02:17:29,210
Okay, let me.

2568
02:17:29,850 --> 02:17:31,610
Alright, now it's spamming.

2569
02:17:31,730 --> 02:17:33,890
Okay, show advance or cool down.

2570
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:37,270
A hundred sixty seconds.

2571
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:38,050
Guys!

2572
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:39,270
Guys, stop!

2573
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:40,310
Guys!

2574
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:45,750
We're trying to figure this out!

2575
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:48,030
Okay, I have to use nightbot.

2576
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:49,210
Okay, okay, there you go.

2577
02:17:49,490 --> 02:17:50,150
I made the cooldown.

2578
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:51,350
Okay, alright.

2579
02:17:51,570 --> 02:17:53,010
Everything should be okay now.

2580
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:56,030
Now, now nightbot, don't stop.

2581
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:57,470
Guys, everything is okay.

2582
02:17:57,850 --> 02:18:04,550
Alright, so so I have to do a giveaway for uh, okay so it's gonna be a keyword giveaway.

2583
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:07,770
Alright, so the keyword- what is the keyword?

2584
02:18:07,910 --> 02:18:09,510
I didn't set up the keyword so I don't remember.

2585
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:13,030
Uh, the keyword is- Alright, guys.

2586
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:26,510
To enter the giveaway for a code, a free code for the game Monster Hunter Wilds it is let's see exclamation point, enter.

2587
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:32,050
Alright, so to enter the- let me get the white color here too.

2588
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:33,750
Guys.

2589
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:34,690
Alright.

2590
02:18:36,570 --> 02:18:43,930
If you wanna enter for a chance to win a code- free copy of the game you do this.

2591
02:18:45,470 --> 02:18:47,210
It's exclamation point, enter.

2592
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:49,890
And then you just enter it once.

2593
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:51,230
You don't have to spam it.

2594
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:53,670
You just have to enter it once guys.

2595
02:18:54,210 --> 02:18:56,310
I need to look at how many codes I'm giving away too.

2596
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:57,910
I'm a professional.

2597
02:18:58,230 --> 02:19:25,990
I was supposed to do this tomorrow but I'm not doing a stream tomorrow so, um because I'm not doing a stream tomorrow, I'm doing it today instead and I believe it is wait, this is not- this is the 28th I'll also be giving away codes on the 27th as well on the day it launches so I'm just gonna let you guys know that I'll be doing it twice.

2598
02:19:26,450 --> 02:19:34,450
One for today and then the other for the other for on launch date itself.

2599
02:19:34,630 --> 02:19:39,130
So I believe it's 5 codes today and then 5 codes on the 27th.

2600
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:42,170
Let me grab the codes real quick too.

2601
02:19:42,270 --> 02:19:49,270
Let me let me let me let me grab- let me grab the stuff real quick.

2602
02:19:49,350 --> 02:19:57,950
I need to make sure I need to make sure I'm doing this correctly cause like my manager's asleep right now so I'm like am I doing this right?

2603
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:03,350
my mod was briefed about this mod.

2604
02:20:03,970 --> 02:20:05,750
Is it 5 codes today?

2605
02:20:08,470 --> 02:20:10,970
I lost stuff to do guys.

2606
02:20:11,530 --> 02:20:15,410
I have a I didn't know if my moderator was briefed.

2607
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:23,690
It would be funny if my moderator was like, I don't know let me check real quick mods, do you know if it was 5 today?

2608
02:20:26,310 --> 02:20:29,830
Guys, I lost stuff to do guys.

2609
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:36,950
I need to be sure if it was 5 today or in 5 on the 27th or if it's 10 today.

2610
02:20:37,230 --> 02:20:39,170
Okay, yes 5 today.

2611
02:20:39,330 --> 02:20:40,170
Okay, cool.

2612
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:41,630
Alright, guys.

2613
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:44,070
I have 10 codes.

2614
02:20:44,250 --> 02:20:47,210
And then I'm gonna pick the win- I'm gonna see who the winner is at.

2615
02:20:47,310 --> 02:20:48,930
Wait, how do we send the codes to them?

2616
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:49,910
Wait a minute.

2617
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:51,850
Oh, that's awkward.

2618
02:20:52,010 --> 02:20:53,970
How do we give them the codes?

2619
02:20:54,210 --> 02:20:58,130
Like We'll figure this out.

2620
02:20:59,290 --> 02:21:02,490
Alright, we have 477 entries.

2621
02:21:02,730 --> 02:21:04,530
Alright, we're gonna pick the first winner.

2623
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:09,850
Congratulations, Brush!

2624
02:21:11,050 --> 02:21:13,070
You won the first one!

2625
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:15,910
Alright, type a message Brush so I know you exist.

2626
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:21,950
Brush, if you type a message, give us your Twitter- Give us your Twitter handle too, by the way.

2627
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:23,270
We're just gonna DM you the Twitter.

2628
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:27,890
We're just gonna DM you the- On Twitter, we'll DM you the code.

2629
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:29,970
Because like- Yeah, you!

2630
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:30,850
Yeah, me!

2631
02:21:31,170 --> 02:21:31,790
Yeah, you!

2632
02:21:31,950 --> 02:21:33,450
What's your Twitter handle, Brush?

2633
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:34,970
What is it?

2634
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:38,050
What's your Twitter handle?

2635
02:21:39,130 --> 02:21:43,490
If you don't have one, make a Twitter and then it'll- Guys, okay.

2636
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:49,590
We'll just make sure we can DM you your Twitter handle.

2637
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:50,070
Or email.

2638
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:50,810
What's your email?

2639
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:54,910
We need your Twitter- Either your Twitter handle or your email.

2640
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:56,490
Oh, shit.

2641
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,030
Okay, guys.

2642
02:21:57,410 --> 02:21:58,430
Don't spam him.

2643
02:21:58,510 --> 02:22:02,070
If he puts his email down, do not spam his email.

2644
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:04,830
Do not spam his email.

2645
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:06,750
I don't know.

2646
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:11,130
I wanted to just randomly post the codes but like, obviously that doesn't work.

2647
02:22:11,430 --> 02:22:12,590
So like- Oh, add!

2648
02:22:12,670 --> 02:22:13,230
Okay, guys.

2649
02:22:13,350 --> 02:22:15,370
Okay, I'm gonna put that in for my mod.

2650
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:17,190
Please don't.

2651
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:18,410
Okay, give us your Twitter handle.

2652
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:20,030
Twitter handle is like the safest.

2653
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:38,210
Okay, I think like my manager did not- I didn't think this through and cause like I thought I was just putting my codes down but they wanted an actual giveaway but then I realized wait, this is a lot harder if we're on YouTube cause we can't whisper things on YouTube.

2654
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:44,210
Cause in Twitch, if you do Twitch giveaways, you can whisper people on Twitch to give them the codes.

2655
02:22:44,310 --> 02:22:47,510
And then I realized how the fuck am I gonna give them the code?

2656
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:55,980
Alright, yeah!

2657
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:01,940
Either give us your Twitch handle give us your Twitch handle or your Twitter handle.

2658
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,000
Alright, Simon, I got it.

2659
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:05,640
I got it.

2660
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:06,880
I got it.

2661
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:07,440
Here you go.

2662
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:08,740
That's his Twitter handle.

2663
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:10,160
Okay, enter.

2664
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:10,920
Okay, let's see.

2665
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:19,440
If you win, give us your at for Twitter or your Twitch account.

2666
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,860
There we go.

2667
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,840
There we go.

2668
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,660
We're figuring this out.

2669
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,560
Guys, we're figuring this out.

2670
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:32,740
We're gonna figure this out live on stream.

2671
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:34,440
Alright, there you go.

2672
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:35,560
Alright.

2673
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:38,380
Our first winner.

2674
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:39,840
Alright, second winner.

2675
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:44,560
Sai166 Congratulations!

Type in chat.

2680
02:23:55,400 --> 02:23:57,460
I can see them waiting for messages.

2681
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:58,220
I can hide.

2682
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:58,980
Oh, he's alive.

2683
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,740
Okay, what is your Twitter and Twitch handle?

2684
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:04,940
What is your Twitter or Twitch handle?

2685
02:24:07,060 --> 02:24:08,980
So then we can DM you your code.

2686
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:12,880
Okay, that's a hello.

2687
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:13,860
Hi.

2688
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,720

Whoops.

2691
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:23,800

02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:31,020

2693
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:32,140

We're still waiting.

2698
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:47,380
I'm still waiting for him to tell me his handle.

2699
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,180
I'm still I'm still waiting.

2700
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:54,180
Are you making a Twitter account or Twitch account right now?

Is that what you're doing?

2702
02:24:56,060 --> 02:24:58,120

02:25:18,330 --> 02:25:19,610

5... Bro, he's not saying anything.

2713
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:30,470
I think he is making his account, guys.

2714
02:25:30,970 --> 02:25:32,810
He's not saying anything!

2715
02:25:34,310 --> 02:25:36,310
I'm like asking if he...

2716
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:38,550
This is all he said to me!

2717
02:25:39,270 --> 02:25:41,430
He literally was just like, hi.

2718
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:43,670
Like, are you even... Are you real?

2719
02:25:44,330 --> 02:25:45,470
Are you a real person?

2720
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:47,010
I can't tell.

2721
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:48,770
This is all he said.

2722
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:50,510
Ever since he got... He won.

2723
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:53,410
I don't know if this guy is a real person.

2724
02:25:53,550 --> 02:25:54,990
He has said nothing since.

2725
02:25:57,170 --> 02:25:59,030
This is literally all he said.

2726
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:02,470
He has said nothing since!

2727
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:06,410
Oh my...

Like, that's all...

2729
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:13,130
That's all he did.

2730
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:15,050
Bro, I'm sorry, man.

2731
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:17,370

02:26:17,370 --> 02:26:18,110
Oh, wait.

02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:18,790
Oh, he's here.

2734
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:19,250
I'm here.

2735
02:26:19,350 --> 02:26:19,910
Okay, okay.

2736
02:26:19,970 --> 02:26:20,730
He said, okay.

2737
02:26:20,970 --> 02:26:21,810
What's your Twitter?

2738
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:23,910
What's going on?

2739
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:25,030
What's going on, buddy?

2740
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:27,690
What's going on?

2741

02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:07,190
Why did everybody just enter and leave?

2810
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:09,630
Where did they all go?

2811
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:11,110

2812
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:12,970
I didn't even do this for that long!

2813
02:29:17,910 --> 02:29:18,550
BoxyBrown!

2814
02:29:18,870 --> 02:29:20,030

02:29:20,030 --> 02:29:20,990
Type one letter.

2816
02:29:22,650 --> 02:29:23,950
One letter!

2817
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:23,990

Just one letter and then also...

2821
02:29:29,910 --> 02:29:32,190
I just didn't know if you were alive.

2822
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:33,950

02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:35,690

02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:43,470
They're all just gone!

2826
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:46,030
Five codes.

2827
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:46,590
There you go.

2828
02:29:46,590 --> 02:29:47,710

Do we have a Bayron Aros in class right now?

2850
02:30:34,350 --> 02:30:35,010

2851
02:30:39,790 --> 02:30:40,990

02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:57,910
Our third code.

2859
02:30:58,370 --> 02:30:59,550
What is your Twitter handle?

2860
02:31:00,430 --> 02:31:01,650
A real person.

2861
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:04,130
Oh my god, an actual real person.

2862
02:31:04,550 --> 02:31:06,930

2867
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:17,110
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom while he types that out.

2868
02:31:17,210 --> 02:31:20,590
I'll give him extra time to type out his account info.

2869
02:31:21,050 --> 02:31:22,090
I'll be right back, everybody.

2870
02:31:22,250 --> 02:31:23,110
Don't put your email!

2871
02:31:23,430 --> 02:31:25,490
I realized email was a bad idea.

2872
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:28,130
But like, we're figuring this out as we go on.

2873
02:31:28,430 --> 02:31:30,890
We got a Bayron for sure.

2874
02:31:31,430 --> 02:31:32,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2875
02:31:32,530 --> 02:31:33,810
Thank you, thank you.

2876
02:31:33,870 --> 02:31:34,870
I'll be right back, everybody.

2877
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,520
All Bayron said was, hey.

2878
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,340
So like, I don't know.

2879
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:26,540
Bayron!

2880
02:32:26,740 --> 02:32:28,600

2881
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:30,500
All he said- Oh!

02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:31,620
Okay, there we go.

2883
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:32,060
There we go.

2884
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:32,680
I got it.

2885
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:33,440

We're doing it, guys.

2892
02:32:44,380 --> 02:32:45,780
We're figuring this out.

2893
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:46,520
Alright.

2894
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:48,500

02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,100
Are you here in this room?

2902
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:08,940
Please.

2903
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,340
I need- Oh, he's here!

2904
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:11,560
He's here!

2905
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:12,900
Oh my god.

2906
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:14,080
Congratulations, Sonic.

2907
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:16,320
I hope you have fun with Monster Hunter.

2908
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:17,880
I hope- Alright.

2909
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:18,900
You know the drill.

2910
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:23,640
What is your Twitter at twitch handle?

2911
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:25,320
Oh my god.

2912
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:26,640
He's here and he's alive.

2913
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:30,520
He's here and he's alive.

2914
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:33,220
Oh my god.

2915
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:36,160
No problem, Sonic.

2916
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:42,680
I'm so excited to see Sonic play Monster- Didn't, like, Monster Hunter do a collab with Sonic the Hedgehog before?

2917
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:43,900
I feel like they did.

2918
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:45,660
I feel like Monster Hunter did a collab with Sega.

2919
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:46,900
Right?

2920
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:47,460
Did they?

2921
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:48,540
I don't know.

2922
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:49,780
Right?

2923
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:50,500
They did, right?

2924
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2925
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:52,360
They did.

2926
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:56,500
Oh, I remember that.

2927
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:59,860
Alright, what is your- Oh, there it is!

2928
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:00,900
There's a Twitter handle!

2929
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:03,800
Miss M- Alright, write that down!

2930
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:05,320
Write that down!

2931
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:06,920
That's the other guy.

2932
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:09,040
That's- Thanks everyone.

2933
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:10,500
Sonic, we need a Twitter handle.

2934
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:11,860
You can say thank you later.

2935
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:16,900
This is for the side guy.

2936
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,040
Sonic!

2937
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:21,460
God, Sonic, you can thank people later!

2938
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:26,300
We just- We can-

2939
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:32,060
Celebrate - Celebrate later, guys!

2940
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:35,380
We- Celebrate later!

2941
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:39,300
No, the one Yoon guy never responded.

2942
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:41,460
So, like, I'm just re-rolling.

2943
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:47,460
The one Yoon guy never responded, so the next roll is the last one.

2944
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:50,780
He's being- We celebrate.

2945
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:55,120
But yes, this is not the last code giveaway.

2946
02:34:56,780 --> 02:34:59,800
We are doing another giveaway.

2947
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:05,640
Another giveaway on launch date, so five more codes will be given out.

2948
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:07,240
A huge shoutout to MSI.

2949
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:10,720
MSI is the one that provided all these codes for us.

2950
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:18,400
I actually have an extra code because Capcom also gave me an extra code, but I'm reusing the MSI code because, like, you know, they gave me a code first.

2951
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:21,320
And a huge shoutout to MSI.

2952
02:35:21,740 --> 02:35:32,640
They're promoting one of their newer monitors, so please feel free to check out the link that's being sent by Nightbot right now regarding the monitors and stuff.

2953
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:33,380
Alright, Sonic.

2954
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:35,320
We just need your handle.

2955
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:39,260
Sonic, we just need that and then we should be good to go.

2956
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:50,500
This is so scuffed, but, like, do you- Do you really expect something different from me?

2957
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:56,100
Yes, thank you, MSI.

2958
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:58,000
Alright, this is their handle.

2959
02:35:58,680 --> 02:35:59,940
There it is.

2960
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:02,040
Alright, last roll.

2961
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:03,900
Are you guys ready?

2962
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:06,340
The last person getting a code.

2963
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:11,100
Hey, guys!

2964
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:12,000
Congratulations!

2965
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:16,480
Congratulations on the last code!

2966
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:17,600
Hey, guys!

2967
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:20,120
Are you still here?

2968
02:36:21,100 --> 02:36:22,380
Are you still here, though?

2969
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:25,980
Hey, I recognize that name.

2970
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:31,420
Let's go!

2971
02:36:32,260 --> 02:36:33,080

02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:38,280

Um, I- Okay, by the way, speaking of giveaway codes, okay, so if you guys follow me on Twitter, I was talking about, um, Cheating Cheetahs, the- the stupid, um, FPS game where everybody aimbots, and then, you know like, the game was actually made by a Japanese game company,

2995
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:05,020
and they like, reached out to me in DMs and was like, oh my god, thank you for promoting our game.

2996
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:09,360
Um, we wanna give you some free game codes for you and your fans.

02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:11,740
And I was like, yay, I love free stuff!

2998
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:20,580
So like, I guess- I guess in the future, I'll also be giving away game codes for that game too.

2999
02:38:20,580 --> 02:38:26,500
