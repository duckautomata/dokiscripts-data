starting right away it will be in like seven minutes uh

8
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,370
because we have to start exactly at two but i did an early
stream because i want to do some, you know, I don't want to

9
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,030
rush into it.

10
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,990
You know, I go live at two and they were like, all right,
we've got to look through everything right now.

11
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,150
Oh shit, I dropped my controller.

12
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:50,650
Yeah.

13
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,010
That, I was like, all right guys, gas, gas, gas.

14
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,130
I don't have much time.

15
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,330
I gotta show you everything.

16
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,110
So now I get a little bit of a leeway and I can do a little
bit, you know, chat, chat a little bit before we go straight

17
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,710
into it.

18
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,670
I will say, um, I did try the game a little bit yesterday.

19
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,810
I did talk about it before.

20
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:21,370
Um, but Deadpool, even though it says zero star, a fucking
lie it has to be the most complicated character i've ever

21
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:31,550
seen in marvel ravills because it is three different roles
each role he has his own specific abilities and his own

22
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:46,510
abilities and um uh stats for each role i i will tell you
this right now his info page is It's just all info.

23
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,410
So I was showing to you guys.

24
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,890
So there would be like katana, guns, and then separate
abilities.

25
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,750
And each one has its own giant ass page of dialogue.

26
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,190
Like it's just, I feel like I'm reading a book.

27
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,550
Like it's a lot of text.

28
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,230
We're going to be doing a lot of reading.

29
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,730
I should have like been like, like trying to get used to his
kit.

30
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,530
But then I like try, like I tried.

31
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:23,110
I like opened up his kid and I like played around a little
bit and I was like I'm done like I was like we're doing it

can go in, let's watch the trailer for Deadpool.

47
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,070
Also, I did not read the patch notes for all the other
characters because I felt like that one hour that we're

48
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,450
going to have, like always, you guys know the drill.

49
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,290
We've done a lot of these sponsored streams before with
Marvel Rivals.

50
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,130
Huge shout out to them.

51
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:51,650
um the first hour we test out deadpool by ourselves and then
the next hour we play with the other content creators um i

52
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:58,610
did tell you guys who the teams were yesterday but if you
guys want a reminder um so you don't be like jump scare

53
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:08,510

will be shroud gail cype flats casey and then the enemy team

54
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,230

teams that i know they're there was, like, a lot of people

55
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:22,710
invited because it is a big, it is a big turn, uh, uh, early
access preview, just because it's Deadpool.

56
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,850
And Deadpool is like one of the, um, the Deadpool is like,
like, you know, one of the Marvel rivals characters, like

57
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,470
not just Marvel rivals, but the Marvel character.

58
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,930
And, you know, he did have like several very successful
movies and stuff.

59
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,590
He is very popular.

60
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,530
So there is a lot of content creators invited.

61
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,650
There is like four different, uh, two different matchups.

62
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,690
So there is team A, B, C, and D.

63
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,210
We won't fighting c or d we're just going to be fighting
team a we're team b um so uh yeah there's a lot of content

64
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,930
creators that have access to there is a lot like i think
like i don't remember i can't count but there is like a

65
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:03,690
bunch of us um and there are four four uh two matches going
on at the same time um other than that um what else what

66
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,470

and then maybe by then at two then we can look through

67
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,370
everything together all right let's watch

68
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,110
I actually, I didn't watch, yeah, but like I said, I felt
like we're gonna spend an entire hour on just Deadpool.

69
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,690
So I didn't read the patch notes for the other stuff.

70
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,310
Like, no, you don't understand.

71
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,490
I would not be surprised if the entire hour is just
Deadpool.

72
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,490
I, there's so much stuff going on.

73
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,070
Yeah, and then the upgrades list also has his own fucking
info page too.

74
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,450
And each role has different upgrades.

75
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,830
just like oh my god i'm not reading for free i'm gonna read
on stream

76
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:03,690
so oh my there's something i need to tell you guys there is
a specific thing um i need to tell you guys about something

77
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:14,830
yeah you need this he is in from the entire time he's doing
a selfie it's not Just like when he does the when it's the

78
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,070
click it's the entire time he's on camera mode Um, I tested
it out the entire time he's in camera mode.

79
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:29,450
That's like two seconds of inbound by the way Like you don't
have to time it There's no time and you just click that and

80
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:40,210
you're invincible like you like I don't he's basically It's
invulnerability Two whole seconds Yeah, so you can shoot his

81
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,210
gun Oh, yeah, by the way, he talks even when you're AFK.

82
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,030
It's literally the mercenary with a mouth.

83
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,430
He literally talks even when you're AFK.

84
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,010
It's very lower accurate.

85
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:57,910
Gordon.

86
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,050
Barney, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

87
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,510
Sarah's, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

88
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,430
Thank you, thank you.

89
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,830
Thank you all for the support, guys.

90
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,010
He has two ults, too.

91
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,910
He has two ults.

92
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,090
I don't even remember.

93
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,830
Oh yeah, I remember what his first alt is.

94
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,590
I forgot what his second alt is, but he has two alts.

95
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,730
It depends on if you are equipping his katana or his guns.

96
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,410
So you have a gut, like, you know, if you're on your gun,
you have a different alt compared to the katana.

97
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,390
Like I said, it's a lot.

98
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,390
It's a lot.

99
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,470
The first, that's, it says zero stars.

100
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,790
I refuse to believe.

101
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,630

That shit is badass, though.

112
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,110
You have to ban him three times.

113
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,430
I can show it to you guys later, but I'll tell you now, you
have to ban Deadpool three fucking times to fully ban

114
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,870
Deadpool.

115
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,150
So you ban Tank Deadpool.

116
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,450
You don't, you don't ban DPS Deadpool or support Deadpool.

117
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,710
That skin is sick.

118
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,870
I will have to say.

119
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,970
I think this skin is pretty.

120
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,290
No, I'm not trolling you.

121
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,650
I wish I was.

122
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,370
I was.

123
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,430

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,850
I'll show you guys this.

126
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,130
It's actually really funny.

127
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,210
I tried it out.

128
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,630
It's pretty funny.

129
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,090
It's really fast.

130
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,190
I'll do it really fast.

131
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,810

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,130
Um, Oh shit.

136
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,450
I don't remember how to create a tournament.

137
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,730

All right.

144
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,350

145
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,070
Okay.

146
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,630
It's team Doki Bird versus no one.

147
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,470
The game of the century.

148
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,090
So you see Deadpool.

149
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,490
Oh shit.

150
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,790
And then just don't get why everyone hates on duelists.

151
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:54,150
has his own line too no at least you can have three
deadpools and one there you go so a bad deadpool and then

152
00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:05,150
and then oh my god who is he gonna protect and then look
okay so deadpool this deadpool is bad he is not zero stars

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,790
Now I ban duelist Deadpool.

158
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,790
And then I'll protect tank Deadpool.

159
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,370
And oh wait I protected tank.

160
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:38,850

00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,760
and like oh okay that's it right and then there's a third
page

335
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:44,900
and this one is for duelist by the way you can see that wow
it changes when you swap it changes when you swap stuff

336
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,680
that's just for one role But they are doing a new thing with
the...

337
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,280
So this is the new...

338
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,560
The new upgrade.

339
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,640
There's an animated Lord icon now instead.

340
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,600
So I believe this is...

341
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,660
Yeah, this is the Lord icon for Deadpool.

342
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,400
Because it's animated now.

343
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
And you can get other rewards too.

344
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
Other than...

345
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,180
Other than the Lord icon.

346
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,200
So you can get like...

347
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,480
I don't know what this is.

348
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,960
But it's a cool ass badge next to you.

349
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,220
And then your Lord icons is now...

350
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,960
uh it's not animated so it's more immersive all right it's
time now it's time for the scary part

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,360
And then there's, get ready to be taunted.

362
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,020
You get bonus HP and healing if you take damage, and I can
get even more.

363
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,460
What the fuck?

364

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Oh my god, it's the gun.

369
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,400
Give me a sec.

370
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
This is the wrong one.

371
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,760
Alright, let me do this again.

372
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,900
Alright, sorry.

373
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
I got the wrong one.

374
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,540
Okay, this one.

375
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,480
Watch this part.

376
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,840
Right here.

377
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,120
No, no, there's...

378
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,760
He has two alts.

379
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,620
I got confused about the alt, guys.

380
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,300
He has two alts, guys.

381
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
He has two alts.

382
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
So, also, here's a bubble.

383
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,680
So, they can't damage through the bubble.

384
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,840
Sorry, I forgot which one is for witch.

385
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,400
It's a lot of pages, okay?

386
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,060
It's a lot of pages.

387
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,660
I got very confused.

388
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,440
All right, get back to my gun.

389
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,740
Anyway, all right, watch this.

390
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,240
This is the, this is the tank.

391
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,680
By the way, I'm on tank right now.

392
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,260
That's why I have 500 HP.

393
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,800
So watch this.

394
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,120
Did I not?

395
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,340
Oh my God, I didn't.

396
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
Give me a sec.

397
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Wait, wait, wait.

398
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,580
I got this.

399
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,020
Give me a sec.

400
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,720
I got...

401
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,340
There we go.

402
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,600
See?

403
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,560
They're not hitting me and they take damage.

404
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,520
There we go.

405
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,660
There you go.

406
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,280
There you see?

407
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,260
You see, guys?

408
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:03,920
You see?

409
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,320
You see?

410
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,080
So, if they don't hit me, they take damage.

411
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,420
So you better hit them.

412
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:26,560
him yes the whole point is that you have to hit him or or it
doesn't work that's it am i still lagging i have no idea why

413
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:35,040
i'm lagging everything nothing says that everything is fine
on my end so i don't know why i'm lagging right now that's

414
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,460
weird looks like we've got ourselves a party anyway yeah so
she's taunting them so anyway here's my upgrade did you guys

415
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,860
remember what any of I will tell you guys this.

416
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,120
This is very interesting.

417
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,240
So by the way, the poop is the bomb.

418
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,840
It's like a little bomb thing.

419
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,260
It does take a lot to render Deadpool.

420
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,020
That is true.

421
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,440
Yeah, it's all...

422
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,920
Okay, so I'll show you guys this.

423
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,840
I upgrade.

424
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,520
You see those two upgrades I did?

425
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Now, look at this.

426
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,020
I swapped.

427
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,760
I'm like, oh shit, we need another DPS.

428
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:25,860
So let me swap the dps deadpool i keep my xp just the way so
i keep it and then so i i i can basically like overlap

429
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:34,260
between which which deadpools i want to play so if i'm like
oh my team needs a my team needs a support deadpool give me

430
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:42,180
a sec and then i do my upgrades again also it's a lot of
here look oh wait he's dead

431
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,540
He does a lot of heals when he shoots at them.

432
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,540
But his damage is very low.

433
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,980
Like, it's not a lot of damage.

434
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,000
But he does a lot of heals, though.

435
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,180
This heals, too.

436
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,740
Like, my attacks basically are heals.

437
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,860
Not my sword, though.

438
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,020
It's only my gun.

439
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,040
Yeah.

440
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
It's only my gun.

441
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,800
But, his heals does a...

442
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,460
I think his heals does, like, a reasonable amount.

443
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,420
Because I can literally throw my sword.

444
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:24,620
it out i can throw this out and then heal with it yeah and
then you cannot have all three deadpools in one game

445
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:32,740
unfortunately um i know it sucks i wish we can but maybe if
i change it to full screen maybe that'll work is that better

446
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:42,460
oh there we go yeah i'm not lagging anymore yeah we fixed it
i just need it to be full screen there we go that's that's

447
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,420
all much better okay so anyway let's go Take Deadpool.

448
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,980
Let's go back.

449
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,960
It's only when I was in game that was lagging, right?

450
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,420
Oh yeah.

451
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,740
So...

452
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,860
I didn't come here to read.

453
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:55,900
I know.

454
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,620
Same.

455
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,160
Same.

456
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,240
True Deadpool.

457
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,840
I agree.

458
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
So let's go through this again.

459
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:18,840
So his E, if he hits you with Taunt, it basically messes up
your vision and burns your health oh my god so his key

460
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:29,540
basically you lose your ui i believe when you hit someone
with an e they can't see shit and then f is get xp and

461
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:36,420
shield my friends when my xp is full i get to upgrade my
abilities score the final hit and force why is the tech so

462
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:46,900
tidy i'm invincible while striking my best okay for this you
get xp for this i'll show you guys This is the selfie mode.

463
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,340
So, watch this.

464
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,620
Alright, I'm gonna kill him right here.

465
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,460
And then, I take no damage.

466
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,500
So, literally, no damage.

467
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,560
Oh, wait, not this.

468
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,660
That's my upgrade book.

469
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,840
I need to take a picture.

470
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,340
Here, see?

471
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,180
No damage at all.

472
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,800
Two seconds.

473
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,060
Like, you don't have to time it.

474
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,420
It's literally just...

475
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,160
No damage.

476
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,800
You have to kill someone else.

477
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,440
You have to kill someone and then...

478
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,700
Oh my god.

479
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,700
I need to, like, make sure I time.

480
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,120
Okay.

481
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,180
This guy.

482
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
And then there you go.

483
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
You can't hurt me.

484
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,500
Two whole seconds of no damage.

485
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,720
Yeah, but you have to.

486
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,320
You have to...

487
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
You have to kill someone for it, though.

488
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,120
So...

489
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,460
So I can't get hurt from that.

490
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,480
And then there's my bubble.

491
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,220
You can shoot through it.

492
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,180
They can't shoot in it.

493
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,800
I don't know how much the HP is.

494
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,120
It didn't say the HP.

495
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm pretty sure.

496
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,740
Yeah, it doesn't say the HP.

497
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,520
Yeah, you need to get the final hit.

498
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Because it's your kills.

499
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,240
But you can also upgrade.

500
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,560
You get XP for taunting too.

501
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,200
Is this 400 HP?

502
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,120
It doesn't say on this.

503
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,720
So I can't tell how much it is.

504
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:26,440
it it is a i mean 400 hp is a lot anyway out of combat he
heals so he has passive healing when he's out of combat and

505
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:37,360
wait what i just processed that wait a minute give me a sec
how long does it take for process how how long does it take

506
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,900
till those passive healing starts up oh my god

507
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,300
And I'm like, oh, wait, excuse me?

508
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,120
That's so fast.

509
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,460
Oh, my God.

510
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,100
I read it, and then I was like, oh, okay.

511
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,020
And then I fully processed it in my head.

512
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,740
I, yeah, that's just like, let me, it's five seconds,
apparently.

513
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,780
And it goes all the way back up to, holy shit.

514
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,240
That is so low accurate.

515
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,320
I would assume his tank is the strongest because it's 400.

516
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,240
It's 500 HP.

517
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,860
Oh my god.

518
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,100
Okay.

519
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:23,500
All right.

520
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,120
That's the gun, by the way.

521
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,400
What's his katana?

522
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,060
So.

523
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,520
All right.

524
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,200
All right.

525
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,100
So his katana.

526
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,660
Okay.

527
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,700
So his katana is just this part.

528
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,520
That's good to know.

529
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:38,780
Okay.

530
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,300
That's good.

531
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,760
By the way, there's no cooldown for the swap.

532
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,780
Like, there's no cooldown.

533
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,880
I feel like that's pretty broken.

534
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,000
I can be like...

535
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,840
I can literally be like...

536
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,100
I'm gonna shoot you now.

537
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,840
Like that.

538
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,680
Yeah, I feel like that's a little broken, but that's
alright.

539
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,240
Yeah, you can do Gumba...

540
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,460
You can Gumba stomp on them.

541
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,440
So watch this.

542
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,800
But I need to...

543
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,140
Yeah, you can stomp them.

544
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,420
Yeah.

545
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,820
There.

546
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,380
You can chain it.

547
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:24,980
Yes, you can.

548
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,660
It's like you can do combos, too.

549
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Yeah, so...

550
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,040
Because every time you do a successful...

551
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,720
And then you can stomp him, too.

552
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,500
Yeah, this...

553
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,840
This, the E, the E blinds them.

554
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,020
So, the UI is gone after that.

555
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,020
Why even play Blade anymore?

556
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,960
I think this is very fast.

557
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,140
Like the...

558
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,800
The fucking...

559
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,440
The ship and the slash?

560
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,500
That's so fast.

561
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,480
Like, wait, can I let...

562
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,420
Yeah, I think this is fast.

563
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,880
Who needs...

564
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,780
Oh, wait, you're right!

565
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
Who needs reload?

566
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,320
Who needs to reload?

567
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,280
I have no ammo.

568
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,080
I slash.

569
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,060
Yeah, and I have upgraded katanas.

570
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,480
All right, and then we got everything.

571
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,780
All right, let's see.

572
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,880
Let's keep reading.

573
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,880
I don't think I'm done reading yet.

574
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,020
I don't think I'll get katana.

575
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,660
All right, let's see what my upgrades do.

576
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,660
So this is tank upgrade.

577
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,220
Okay, plus my crew gets a damp...

578
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,000
Jesus, Christ.

579
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,900
Christ, the text is so small.

580
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,020
I feel like...

581
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,800
Read for me, Doki.

582
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Okay.

583
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,260
Teammates... Okay, I'm looking at magical unicorn shield
upgraded.

584
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,380
My...

585
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,820
Okay, wait.

586
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:06,360
With the upgraded katana, my stabs hits crit and a bunny
bounce hit makes you the next swing a stabby special.

587
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:12,120
So if you manage to stomp on their heads, your next swing is
like a crit.

588
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,080
The The boom is really good.

589
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,160
The boom is because it's an extra, like, explosive thing,
which I showed you guys, so.

590
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,640
It does a lot of damage.

591
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,160
Okay, it does a lot if I get it here.

592
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,440
Okay, if I...

593
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,080
Okay, and then...

594
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,060
Okay, I counted it wrong.

595
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,740
Give me a sec.

596
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,840
All right, there we go.

597
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,940
There we go.

598
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,320
All right.

599
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,140
I think I upgraded everything.

600
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,440
All right, give me a sec.

601
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,660
Let me go back to reading.

602
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,480
All right.

603
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,920
He's going to be very hard to learn, I feel like.

604
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,580
I feel like it's going to be a while till people realize how
to play him because he's so hard to learn.

605
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,760
Because you have to learn all three roles of Deadpool.

606
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:02,440
Because I feel like the strongest Deadpool player is someone
that can be very versatile on Deadpool and can be like, can

607
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,560
play, what are these?

608
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,420
Bro, there's like, there's three pages.

609
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,700
It's like the tiniest text I ever see.

610
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,720
Like this is, okay, okay, look at Emma.

611
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:27,120
this is emma's abilities and then we swapped a deadpool and
i feel like i'm reading a novel right now i'm freaking i'm

612
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:42,540
reading a freaking novel okay um you cute character okay um
so has upgraded i thought bro i'm just gonna upgrade stuff i

613
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:55,740
don't zero difficulty character by the way all right so his
e he blinds people and your teammates who are in your e

614
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,220
circle gets a damage reduction buff so they're basically
invincible

615
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:11,960
um and if like the enemy team um the enemy team is in your e
they lose their ui that's insane if i was like if i just

616
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,360
have my ui is gone i'm like I don't know my cooldowns.

617
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,740
I have to, like, internally.

618
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,760
Okay, his...

619
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,320
Okay, his first up, the Banhammer.

620
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,400
I assume the Banhammer is for the gun.

621
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,880
Okay, that is for...

622
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,960
He has bonus health and healing.

623
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,520
And...

624
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,920
And if they miss their abilities, they take ongoing damage.

625
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:43,980
And the more damage they take, the more HP I get.

626
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:56,400
heal if they if they missed their shots on me basically and
then the second one the katana the katana basically it is

627
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:06,900
speed healing dashes and bonus health and then you can
unlock super buffs massive speed and healing and his healing

628
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,900
factor resets so each hit means more hp for the crew and so
your teammates will get oh my god wait this is like a

629
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:24,240
support as a tank so basically if if i use my uh here and i
can it can make it last for a very long time too apparently

630
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:41,460
so okay whoops so i oh my god so my all is still going my oh
oh all right so apparently you can get like a really long

631
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,880
all if you get like five combos Yeah, I have all my HP back,
too.

632
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,700
So if I do, like, a combo, I think I would get, like, a
super long.

633
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,200
A super long, like, oh, let me see if I can do it correctly.

634
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,780
800, yeah, I got 800 HP, yeah.

635
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,500
Yeah, he's basically, like, a Captain America, too, if you
think about it.

636
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,320
I just need to...

637
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,940
I need to hit, like...

638
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,280
Okay, four.

639
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,160
No!

640
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,000
Give me longer!

641
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,200
I think I can master.

642
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,900
If you hit five, you get a really long ult.

643
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,160
It lasts forever.

644
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,500
You have to hit up to five, though, for it.

645
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,980
All right, let me try again.

646
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Yeah, I think the Vandga, I think Tank Deadpool might be the
strongest.

647
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah, there you go.

648
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,200
There you go.

649
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,580
Yeah, see, you can have...

650
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,200
Look, you have longer ult now.

651
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:52,760
like oh my god i'm so i'm invincible so now i have like uh i
don't know it gave me seven more seconds if i can hit the

652
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:06,740
combo that's three and baby makes yeah and you get yourself
your speed boost uh what was it speed boost where is it

653
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:18,620
speed and healing buffs and then extra hp so you have Megas
and then your team your team also gets the heals Anyway, so

654
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:32,060
that's Vanguard Deadpool Anyway, now that we looked at
Vanguard Deadpool Let's look at TPS Deadpool Anyway, that's

655
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:44,100
one out of three guys That's one out of three Alright, let's
read Let's read duelist Deadpool now see what's different

656
00:41:44,100 --> 00:42:00,340
about him um so oh my god wait is this all different too
wait give me a sec okay the band hammer okay the band hammer

657
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:09,940
skill issue okay so it's all it is a little different so um
boom gavel drops and i slapped him with okay so it's pretty

658
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,820
similar um in terms of I assume it's pretty similar.

659
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,620
We're...

660
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,240
Okay.

661
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah.

662
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,640
Oh, he takes a lot more damage.

663
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,180
Oh, yeah.

664
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,540
No, that's a lot more damage.

665
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,060
That's a lot.

666
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,140
So if you were like, fuck that guy in particular, I could
just kill him with my ult, I feel.

667
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,400
Like...

668
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,520
Yeah.

669
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,860
Yeah, no.

670
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,660
That guy's dead.

671
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,300
Yeah.

672
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,140
So I assume like, if you hate one particular player, they're
just dead.

673
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:57,740
skill yeah yeah ult them and then hide behind a wall that is
true yeah wait so the tank one is different the tank one

674
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:08,380
gets bonus hp and healing with the ult so oh my god wait oh
wait that's crazy wait no the tank deadpool is all vanguard

675
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:15,060
deadpool is the strongest because not only does he kill
someone with his ult like just one person but he also gets

676
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:30,120
bonus heals and bonus heals and um yeah and like like extra
heals that's crazy all right so trio taunts mess up their

677
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:40,120
vision tankster hits okay what's different okay it has to
beat the headshot ever see someone throw their own face

678
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,760
watch me ko a crowd Then catch my mug.

679
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,660
Don't lose your head over it.

680
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,500
I assume...

681
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,320
Oh!

682
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
He throws his head.

683
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,570
How do I throw my head?

684
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:52,970
Oh, wait.

685
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:54,510
Did I throw my head?

686
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,970
Oh, it's this.

687
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,530
Oh!

688
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,970
It's a boomer...

689
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,630
Oh!

690
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,510
That's this extra thing.

691
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,650
Wait, it's like a little boomerang.

692
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,450
Yeah.

693
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,690
Oh, my God.

694
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,050
Wait.

695
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,030
That's crazy.

696
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,310
That's so long.

697
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,370
Yeah, oh, he's throwing my character.

698
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,690
Yeah, it's like...

699
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,570
That's so long, too.

700
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,770
If they're all like...

701
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,970
We're all like tank, like, doing like...

702
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,130
Oh yeah, my lord icon.

703
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,230
Yeah, it's like three throws.

704
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,910
If it's upgraded, that is true.

705
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,010
That is the upgraded.

706
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,830
But that's crazy for it upgraded.

707
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,860
That's crazy for it upgraded here.

708
00:44:47,620 --> 00:45:01,660
it's because you it's three hits for a fully upgraded uh
thing yeah i mean page three where is it there you go jogo

709
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:08,700
doesn't say how much the upgrade is but if you catch it
thrice oh if you catch it you have to catch it too yeah you

710
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:17,380
have to catch this and then keep talking Plus, I tank hits
like a champ.

711
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,840
Enemies dead.

712
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:19,880
Jesus Christ.

713
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:20,800
Enemies dead.

714
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,180
Okay.

715
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,260
Speed.

716
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,320
Oh my god.

717
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,780
For the duelist ult.

718
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:30,900
Wait.

719
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,400
Get katana ult.

720
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,740
Okay.

721
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,240
So if you have your katana and you ult with your katana, you
get speed, healing.

722
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,660
And with the upgrade, you get damage up.

723
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:53,920
you can unlock super speed, super healing, super damage
boost, and reset all your cooldowns except healing factor

724
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,740
though, but oh Jesus Christ

725
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:07,360
okay so if you upgrade your katana up super speed, super
healing, and super damage boost I don't think your buddies

726
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:15,880
get it though at least the good part is that unlike the tank
up Your teammates, your teammates don't get the, don't get

727
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,760
the buffs, I assume, from what I read.

728
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
So, so, literally.

729
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,960
Yeah, okay, I killed everyone.

730
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,200
No one's spawning it anymore.

731
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,960
Oh my god, and I got, oh my god.

732
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,890
This is a fucking crazy long haul.

733
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,030
This is a crazy long haul.

734
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:51,810
i don't know okay i assume all right looking at all the dead
pools the tank and the dps pool seems the scariest to me um

735
00:46:51,810 --> 00:47:09,310
you feel that so fast okay i will say i will say looking at
all of it um his the tank and dps would be the scariest i

736
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:16,570
assume the support is not as scary because like you don't do
as much damage um but you do do a lot of healing so oh yeah

737
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:27,690
imagine that with oh my god bro imagine dps pool or tank
pool with damp it all as well that's insane oh my god you'd

738
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:39,600
be like like you'll be the speed of light it's really the
speed of light when you're doing it all right So luckily the

739
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:48,880
only thing different with DPS and tank is that their right
their their right click is the the thing the little spinning

740
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,940
thing so that's different so that's good so I don't have to
and their alts it's the right click and the alt that's

741
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:05,200
different everything else seems to be the same I hope like I
said I told you guys like that's why I didn't read the patch

742
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,320
notes for the other characters because I felt like we're
gonna Spend all our time figuring out Deadpool together.

743
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,180
We have to learn this to get there.

744
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,960
Okay, so we got this guy.

745
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,440
This is a team effort.

746
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,320
All right.

747
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,020
Anyway, now support Deadpool.

748
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,600
This is why I say he does not stop.

749
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,920
Okay, support Deadpool.

750
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,160
All right.

751
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,920
His difference is that...

752
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:47,260
heal my area touch my team and I dash Lacey down score hit
deal damage and heal my allies in the area okay so oh

753
00:48:50,540 --> 00:49:00,700
oh you can you can jump on your teammates to heal them
basically alright so this heals and then I can jump on you

754
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:12,820
to heal you and then this this is a healing ring like so
this this is a healing ring now instead instead of a instead

755
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:18,500
of a buff ring this ring heals you wait wasn't the DPS one a
damage boost for E?

756
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:33,580
Guys I'm mixing up my fucking deadpools now give me a sec
I'm mixing up my rolls I remember the DPS deadpool the E I

757
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:40,920
roast messed up their visions and tanked oh no okay so the E
for DPS is just a taunt It doesn't do anything special.

758
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,360
Oh, wait, no, again!

759
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,700
Okay, keep talking, even block your screen, but then they
won't even find...

760
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,800
Okay, so, for DPS, it's just a taunt, so it disables their
UI.

761
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,960
Or not disables their UI, it makes it so their UI is hard to
see.

762
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,210
And burn your health non-stop.

763
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,270
I swear to God that it was different.

764
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,970
Okay, so the tank one is...

765
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,330
Oh, here we go!

766
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,410
And the tank one is damage reduction.

767
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,850
Alright, now I see it.

768
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:18,290
So tank e is damage reduction the dps e is nothing they
don't get shit you're already dps you get everything you

769
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:30,270
want um the the support e is uh when you upgrade it
obviously you get damage buffs and heals like oh shit wait

770
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:39,010
that's crazy okay so support e is a damage buff no i meant
for your teammates i meant these are teammates get anything

771
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:49,630
so you get damage resistance on dps if you press e but if
you're a support if your tank doom doom i'm sorry support

772
00:50:49,630 --> 00:51:03,070
deadpool you get uh you get damage bus for your teammates
and heals but if you're a tank deadpool you get uh damage

773
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:08,090
resistance for your teammates as well jesus christ okay

774
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,870
All right, what are the odds?

775
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,850
Okay, it's Todd.

776
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,750
Todd's that take damage over time and get even more pain
when you miss an ability.

777
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,870
My nearby teammates and I.

778
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,110
Okay, so.

779
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,070
His odds here is that his teammates also get heals for this
one, too.

780
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,510
So, well, my teammates are dead.

781
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,210
Unluckily, this is my aura.

782
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:44,290
My teammates died when I set it off.

783
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,470
But, you know, it's the thought that counts, you know?

784
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,790
It's the thought that counts.

785
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,330
I tried.

786
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,130
I tried to save them.

787
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,630
And then final exam.

788
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:59,810
Okay, there we go.

789
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,950
Guys, this is the final exam for Deadpool.

790
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,530
You don't have to go to Spotted or Dying Doll.

791
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,310
It's just a force of habit for me.

792
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,390
It's just a force of habit from other games.

793
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:17,810
Um, do what the game says and hit another enemies with
upgrade our heals and get bonus HP.

794
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,950
Deadpool's got your back.

795
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:19,870
Okay, wait.

796
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,230
My nearby teammates and I get a healing off.

797
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:22,770
Oh, okay.

798
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,230
So it's literally just a...

799
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,630
And get bonus HP.

800
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:27,050
Okay.

801
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:28,350
So it's literally just...

802
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,270
It's just everyone gets heals when I...

803
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,230
That's literally it.

804
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,510
I still think tank and DPS dooms a Deadpool.

805
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:36,990
It's hard.

806
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:37,950
They both start with D.

807
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:44,810
I There we go I still think the

808
00:52:48,530 --> 00:53:01,650
It's not that I don't know I don't know if the heals are
that fast But we all get healing though Doom Alright We have

809
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:07,370
to wait though There is a cooldown because I assume He
builds off so fucking fast That they added their own

810
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,510
cooldown to it.

811
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:15,310
Like, I assume that's why there is its own cooldown for his
ult.

812
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,590
Like, if you see here, I can't build up all after it's done.

813
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,610
I literally have to wait for the cooldown to end.

814
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,770
Yeah.

815
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,890
So, I'm waiting.

816
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,210
I just assumed the ult goes so fast.

817
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,210
It's, like, too fast to build.

818
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,930
Okay, and then

819
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,110
Yeah, there we go.

820
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,750
Now I have a long ass up.

821
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,610
Now we heal forever.

822
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,610
All right, anyway, that's Deadpool.

823
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,950
Did you all retain any information about Deadpool?

824
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,910
Did you guys...

825
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,430
Don't worry.

826
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:14,310
I assume, like, like, like, things will get easier over
time.

827
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,330
I assume that.

828
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,150
I really, I really assume things will get easier.

829
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,190
Oh, yeah, and the boom does heal, too.

830
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,510
I just gotta wing it.

831
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,350
Yeah, me too.

832
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:32,870
Same.

833
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,710
We get it.

834
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,930
Yo, who wants to write a study guide for all of us,
honestly?

835
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,230
I...

836
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,070
No, we're...

837
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:43,950
Me too, guys.

838
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:45,850
Me too.

839
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,190
This doesn't heal.

840
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,010
Unfortunately, this doesn't heal.

841
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,010
It has to be the gun.

842
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,670
You can do this.

843
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,430
They're dead, but you can...

844
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:58,450
Your katana doesn't heal, but...

845
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,670
But when you do this, it heals.

846
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,770
You heal your teammates here.

847
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:07,610
You heal your teammates with your katana slash.

848
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,550
That's why there's a green aura.

849
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,290
Yeah, so that's why, yeah, you heal off.

850
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,230
Like, your teammates can get healed from that.

851
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,130
I don't think you can get healed, but I assume that...

852
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:23,770
Okay.

853
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,470
Yeah, your teammates can get healed, though, when you do
this.

854
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,290
Let me read this just to be sure I'm not, like, messing with
you guys.

855
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:51,650
because every hit near yeah every hit heals nearby allies
yep i was right i assume i was like i see green i see green

856
00:55:51,650 --> 00:56:04,230
so i assume that i am healing people that's what green means
it means heal that's what the color is um anime man think

857
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,970
about the twitch prime thank you thank you

858
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,570
No self-healed?

859
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,110
I...

860
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,450
Guys, he already has self-healed.

861
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:18,910
This.

862
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,990
And also...

863
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,770
Oh yeah, and I can judge him.

864
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,770
There.

865
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,570
I get healed when he can't hit shit, apparently.

866
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,250
And then...

867
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,750
And then...

868
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,510
I have like several...

869
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:36,830
Okay, here you go.

870
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,330
And then...

871
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,370
Wait, there we go.

872
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,730
There I healed.

873
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,130
There we go.

874
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,890
He has, like, several forms of self-healing.

875
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,010
I think he's fine.

876
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:57,270
I think he's...

877
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:02,930
And I'm healed.

878
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:06,950
So I think he'll be okay.

879
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,450
I think he'll...

880
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,490
What's the range on the jump?

881
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:09,970
Judge?

882
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:15,290
Like this far.

883
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:17,110
Wait.

884
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:19,690
Wait, can I...

885
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,510
I should just do...

886
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:26,570
Hey.

887
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,730
Like pretty far, honestly.

888
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:30,470
Wait a minute.

889
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,510
It's actually...

890
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,290
Alright, how far can I do with this, though?

891
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,300
Wait.

892
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,440
It's not...

893
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,240
Uh...

894
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,000
We'll do here.

895
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,660
It's like...

896
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,960
27 meters.

897
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,220
27 meters.

898
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,140
I think it's pretty far.

899
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,460
If like, I'm like...

900
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,360
If like...

901
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,520
I wonder if I could do it.

902
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,680
Wait, actually, give me a sec.

903
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,380
I have a funny idea.

904
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,980
I'm going to test this out.

905
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,480
Okay, he was dead.

906
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:21,460
okay he was he was very he was already like super dead i was
not aware of that i wanted to see that and i run away yeah i

907
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:30,360
was trying to figure that out i want to see what the range
is if i just judge him and i just run away oh you can oh

908
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:41,720
shit wait i could literally do that and i just fucking run
away like he'll never hit me imagine that yeah so i can run

909
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:54,140
away after i else yeah i'd just be like poop and then you
can't find me and i water the way water yeah and i water the

910
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:07,760
way technically them shooting their gun and not shooting at
me is missing they hit my as missing your shot I know that's

911
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:18,120
pretty wild they're like yep but I'm not aiming for you then
I'm like yeah then that's a skill issue that's it that's a

912
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:28,780
skill issue because they miss their shots technically that's
insane oh yeah what is the what even is the team up with

913
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:33,760
dead point dead point wait I guess I see this It's pretty.

914
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,720
What's the team up with Deadpool, Deadpool, Deadpool, and
Jeff?

915
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,880
All right, what is it?

916
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,000
I didn't even look at this.

917
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,800
Deadpool, oh my god, wait.

918
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,840
Okay, Deadpool hands Jeff the land shark a plushie that Jeff
can spit it ahead.

919
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,880
We're continuously taught nearby enemies and block missions.

920
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,280
But allies in range enjoys a plush-powered healing ability.

921
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:12,360
oh yeah he has a sticky bomb i saw that what the fuck okay
basically he gets a healing bonus so jeff does jeff the

922
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,780
shark a plushie jeff can spit it where he's taught nearby
enemies oh it blocks vision while enemies in range enjoy a

923
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:31,940
plush power all right why be that oh so it'll block his
vision oh i see but then this will heal oh my god it's like

924
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,740
Water wingsprout things.

925
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,380
Wait, that's cute.

926
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,560
That's like a little...

927
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,700
That's like a little lawn thing.

928
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,500
I need to see this, though.

929
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,380
There is a place where you can program an AI.

930
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,160
Control switch.

931
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,880
I have never done this before, but I want to know...

932
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,260
Oh.

933
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,760
Um... What is Deadpool doing?

934
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,500
Nothing.

935
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,760
What is he...

936
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,980
What is he doing?

937
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,200
Can he fight?

938
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,680
Oh, you can't make him fight?

939
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,440
Never mind.

940
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,020
Oh, wait.

941
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,420
Basic combat.

942
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:17,900
There we go.

943
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:18,140
Wait.

944
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,700
Advanced combat.

945
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,280
Apply.

946
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,240
All right.

947
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,020
Do your thing.

948
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,000
All right.

949
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,880
I want to know.

950
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,360
I want to know.

951
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,400
What does it look like?

952
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,240
He's gonna, they're gonna mess me up.

953
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,100
Okay, do your thing.

954
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,620
Oh my god, my UI.

955
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,220
Oh my god.

956
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,580
Alright.

957
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,160
It's like that Necro's clip.

958
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:51,980
With like three eyes.

959
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,760
But now it's three deadpulls.

960
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,920
Oh my.

961
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,540
Oh, no!

962
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:06,120
What?

963
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,840
Oh, my God!

964
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,950
So...

965
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:26,790
So, I assume that, like...

966
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:27,470
Oh, my...

967
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,110
I actually can't see shit.

968
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,450
I'm overstimulating right now.

969
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:35,590
I'm...

970
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,030
Okay.

971
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,070
That was interesting.

972
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,230
That...

973
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,250
That was interesting.

974
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,790
Okay,

975
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:54,770
well, at least there's only one Deadpool instead of three.

976
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,110
At least I'm missing.

977
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,650
Can you do that again?

978
01:02:58,970 --> 01:02:59,970
The problem, I got you.

979
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,010
Okay, let's have one.

980
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:02,890
Maybe we'll have one.

981
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:06,130
And see, like, how bad that is.

982
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,690
Four, three, two, one.

983
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:26,490
come on do your thing come on do your thing he's less
aggressive when there's one of them there you okay okay and

984
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:36,190
then all right okay so it's like that it's not as bad as
three i assume when i had three deadpulls when i had three

985
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:39,330
deadpulls it was like they just spammed all three

986
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:51,270
it is pretty bad but like three deadpools was a lot this was
still this is still a lot but three was definitely over

987
01:03:51,270 --> 01:04:07,440
stimulation there you go and apparently um if you stay in
too long he he locks your ui you don't get a deadpool we're

988
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,740
stopping i'm out oh my god i am out of the area

989
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:27,360
Deadpool train he's just like I'm not done with you yet I'm
trying to fucking leave the training arena plays play

990
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:38,160
Daredevil against Deadpool I think Daredevil might win not
gonna lie imagine that in 18 I do not want to imagine that

991
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:51,480
it looks really like it's a lie it really is a lot anyway
did you guys enjoy the preview the dead i i think the most

992
01:04:51,480 --> 01:05:00,860
fun has to be either tank or a dps deadpool i'm pretty sure
i think the support deadpool is much more balanced i will

993
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:09,540
assume i feel like the support deadpool is much more that
balance i think i'm gonna be very confused about cheese i

994
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:25,560
don't need my reload is so fast too if you think about it
like this reload is fast this is a fast reload I am oh like

995
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:40,820
and I have 40 like I have 40 bullets like I'd never have to
reload again I never have to reload I'm like I have like I

996
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:51,120
will say I do have like muscle memory from Gambit shift yeah
but for support this is really fast for support i swear to

997
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:58,040
god every time i play like luna or some shit i feel like i
take like 20 years to reload and she has like more less ammo

998
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:07,200
too she literally has less ammo i think tank pool is the
strongest only because you can run go from 500 hp to fucking

999
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:16,000
800 that is that should be legal that that that should not
be legal.

1000
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,240
Oh, wait, isn't there a new map, too?

1001
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,660
Oh, we never looked at the map.

1002
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,680
Sorry, guys.

1003
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,160
And I was right.

1004
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:27,680
It takes an entire hour to showcase Deadpool.

1005
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,440
I was right.

1006
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,600
I fucking knew it.

1007
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:39,220
I knew it would be I knew it would be like, oh, map is not
out yet?

1008
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,020
Okay, good.

1009
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,500
Okay, I didn't forget anything.

1010
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:50,760
Anyway, guys, again, I want to say before we go meet the
other creators I'll say thank you again to the devs for

1011
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,760
inviting me for the Marvel Rivals season 6 early access.

1012
01:06:54,580 --> 01:07:00,860
Remember, Deadpool is launching on January 16th and Marvel
Rivals is free to play.

1013
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:05,580
And there's always going to be like, you know, new updates
coming in all the time, especially every half season.

1016
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,980
It really does help me out a lot.

1017
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:21,100
All right, apparently, all right, let me go join the crowd.

1018

I don't know, sound team.

1019
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:28,360
If you're here, I'm going to need you to message me on
Discord for this because this is Twitch and you'll know the

1020
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:28,700
drill.

1021
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:38,360
Okay, I need to make sure I need to restart my Discord
because every time I do stuff on Discord where I have to

1022
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,220
interact with people, it has to be admin.

1023
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:42,380
Run as admin.

1024
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:52,960
I have to run as admin so I can mute myself i don't even
remember what button i used for it but but but but i hope i

1025
01:07:52,960 --> 01:08:04,320
showcased everything i'm sorry it was a lot it was it was a
lot to showcase it is definitely the most complicated

1026
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:14,080
character that's ever been released yeah i tried to
invincibility um the only new team up is the spider-man um

1027
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:22,360
it's just a lot because you have to remember what each
character does and like his because like each of the buffs

1028
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:29,500
and the buffs he gives is different for each role and like
that's like i guess i'll just have to remember the support

1029
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:39,620
buffs yeah i just have to remember um the support those
support buffs and then that'll be fine but like for anyone

1030
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:43,260
for like the people the super versatile people they'll have
to remember more

1031
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,720
I mean, it was literally a fucking novel.

1032
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,920
I did the best I could.

1033
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,360
I tried to read a novel in one hour.

1034
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:00,420
Alright, I'm in.

1035
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,880
I just need to add the Discord overlay real quick, guys.

1036
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,000
There's Discord overlay time.

1037
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,960
What are you waiting for?

1038
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
We're waiting for me joining the Marvel Rivals...

1039
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,420
I'm in it, but I need to join.

1040
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,760
What team B voice?

1041
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,600
Is this the right?

1042
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,620
Oh, that's not the right.

1043
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,640
Team BVC.

1044
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,240
There you go.

1045
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,400
Let's see if it works.

1046
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:31,680
Sometimes my Fuggy stuff likes to be like, likes to fuck
with me.

1047
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,600
So we'll see how it goes.

1048
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:37,450
Yep.

1049
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,590
I just think it does.

1050
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,070
Oh, wait.

1051
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,510
There we go.

1052
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:44,910
Oh, wait.

1053
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:45,510
Here it is.

1054
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,770
That's not the right one, though.

1055
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,410
I need the one where they're, like, horizontal.

1056
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:51,530
There we go.

1057
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:53,430
Yay, it works.

1058
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:56,590
That's us.

1059
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,830
Who the fuck is the Hello Kitty Shadow?

1060
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,070
Oh, okay, it's Casey.

1061
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,310
It's like, who's Akkan instead?

1062
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:06,010
The Hello Kitty Shadow.

1063
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,590
There we go.

1064
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:11,850
I think we just wait.

1065
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,790

1100
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,990
That was fair, dude.

1101
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,790
The Vanguard's first.

1102
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:52,390
It's at the top.

1103
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,810
I had to scroll to the DPS bar.

1104
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:57,550
I was going to grab the Vanguard and then swap the support
later.

1105
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,030
Oh, that's so smart.

1106
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,510
Yeah.

1107
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,650
Oh, my God.

1108
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:04,430
Half a second.

1109
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,530
I actually had it.

1110
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,650
Okay, like, who got changed this season that I could try
out?

1111
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:11,910
Namor had a rework, right?

1112
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:12,890
A small rework?

1113
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,970
Yeah, Namor is more consistent, supposedly.

1114
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:15,850
He is more consistent.

1115
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:16,730
Yeah.

1116
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:17,930
I'm trying Blade.

1117
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:18,910
Blade got changed a lot.

1118
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,010
Oh, yeah, I heard Blade is super strong now.

1119
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,470
Yeah, I'm excited.

1120
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,600
I feel like every time I try this character before, he has
not been good.

1121
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,220
So I'm hoping this time.

1122
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:32,660
You're right.

1123
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,680
Yeah, the idea of Blade being cool is sick, right?

1124
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,940
Like, he should be good.

1125
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:36,340
Right.

1126
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,520
Like, get him in there.

1127
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:38,960
That's what I'm saying.

1128
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,160
Oh, wait.

1129
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,100
I could try rogue.

1130
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,360
Yeah, that might be embarrassing.

1131
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,360
I've never played rogue.

1132
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,300
Are you guys okay with that?

1133
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,640
Oh, yeah, go for it.

1134
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,540
Rogue is so fun.

1135
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,800
Actually so fun.

1136
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:48,740
Especially with Gambit.

1137
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,500
That team up is so strong.

1138
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,940
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1139
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,940
You got the, yeah.

1140
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,120
Let's just play all the team ups.

1141
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,460
Four, three, two, one.

1142
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,780
I have no clue what she does.

1143
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,460
I'll follow you flat.

1144
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,220

01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,280
Oh my god, he was one.

1178
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:47,900
That guy was one.

1179
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,000
I think they're top right.

1180
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,220
The hell out of my eyes.

1181
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:54,620
Yeah, they are.

1182
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,200
Yeah.

1183
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,900
They're a little bit bigger now.

1184
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:01,240
You know, I'm having a feeling that Deadpool is not a shield
team.

1185
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,340
Just a little.

1186
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,100
Oh wait.

1187
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,820
Also, there's Neymar behind us.

1188
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,140
Oh, I'm dead.

1189
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:07,640
I'm dead.

1190
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:09,800
I got mine.

1191
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,180
I got mine.

1192
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,040
No way, I have the real solution.

1193
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:12,980
Okay.

1194
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,380
The real solution coming up here.

1195
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,420
Is it Namur?

1196
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,760
The Gale Hulk.

1197
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:19,740
Oh, the Hulk.

1198
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,280
The gulch coming out.

1199
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:21,700
Okay.

1200
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,440
Wait, you got buffed though.

1201
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,100
We got buffed though.

1202
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,200
That's right.

1203
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:25,880
Let's see it.

1204
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:26,740
Get me in there.

1205
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:27,500
What did he get buffed with?

1206
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,760
His ultimate.

1207
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,840
And he also jumps around faster.

1208
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:36,420
I have a feeling that Hello Namur might be behind us.

1209
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,140
I got one.

1210
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:41,720
I got one.

1211
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,000
Nice.

1212
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,680
Wait, huge.

1213
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,040
I'm in there.

1214
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,920
I have my little spray here.

1215
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:48,960
Oh.

1216
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,160
Oh, purple.

1217
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:51,660
What?

1218
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,580
Oh, goodbye, everybody.

1219
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:56,860
Oh, God.

1220
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:57,420
Well.

1221
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,120
Yeah.

1222
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,000
I do have one, but I will die.

1223
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:04,980
All good.

1224
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:05,800
Oh, my goodness.

1225
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,220
We got my ult for next one.

1226
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,540
Oh, we got Gambit up.

1227
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,840
These both supports.

1228
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,460
We do.

1229
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1230
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,160
They're burning, they're burning, they're burning.

1231
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,760
They're taking someone off the map.

1232
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,320
It's okay, I'm out of the spot.

1233
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,780
Care boker, TP.

1234
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,580
Kid at me, kid at me, kid at me, kid at me.

1235
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,860
He's gonna aim for a shroud.

1236
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,620
He wants that clip.

1237
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:25,960
No, he tried.

1238
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:26,660
He tried.

1239
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:29,940
All right, wait, we grouped this corner and we go gambit
all.

1240
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,580
Wait, I'm ready, I'm ready.

1241
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,240
He's one, he's one.

1242
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:34,620
Oh, nice.

1243
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,900
Oh, I'm walking on that.

1244
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1245
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,760
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

1246
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,560
Wait, I can't.

1247
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,200
I jumped too high.

1248
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,320
Oh, I can't.

1249
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:47,920
I can't.

1250
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:48,320
I can't.

1251
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,460
Are you okay?

1252
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:50,260
Are you okay?

1253
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:50,940
I'm not good at him.

1254
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:51,500
Okay, okay.

1255
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,200
Okay, he died last.

1256
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:52,980
He killed him.

1257
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:53,800
He died.

1258
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:53,940
Yeah,

1259
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,240
yeah, yeah.

1260
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:58,840
They might.

1261
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1262
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:00,580
He had TP.

1263
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,520
There's no way.

1264
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,220
Unless they saw.

1265
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:02,740
Yeah, yeah, he TPed.

1266
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,240
He TPed.

1267
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,240
Oh, we're good.

1268
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:04,880
Wait, wait.

1269
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:05,340
Invis.

1270
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:05,920
They're stalling.

1271
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:06,260
They're stalling.

1272
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,160
Let's go.

1273
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:09,700
Nice.

1274
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,400
Good stuff, guys.

1275
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,680
Look, see?

1276
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:12,760
Oh, we need it.

1277
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,360
Someone close.

1278
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,760
Over here.

1279
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,420
Gotcha, Jeff.

1280
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,320
Oh, my goodness.

1281
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,540

01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:22,700
Dude, Neymar hurts now.

01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,580
Yeah, he's strong.

1285
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,400

01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,320
Let's go!

1360
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,260
Oh, I keep forgetting my team up.

1361
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,920
I'll throw it now.

1362
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,520
I keep forgetting I have this.

1363
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:24,860
One behind?

1364
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,260
Oh my god!

1365
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,720
Oh my god!

1366
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:30,860
Destroyed.

1367
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,360
He's mentioning you on Hulk now.

1368
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,760
He thinks he can dip you.

1369
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,460
Nah, nah.

1370
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,100
He's You can try.

1371
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,660
You've seen your methods.

1372
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,060
He played with you for so much.

1373
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:51,840
What are you through?

1374
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,740
Spider-Man as well.

1375
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:53,760
I'm pretty sure.

1376
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,460
They should see us on these one trick.

1377
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:58,540
Did you?

1378
01:22:59,300 --> 01:22:59,960
Did you?

1379
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:00,800
All right.

1380
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,120
Oh, you treat you.

1381
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:03,620
Oh, shit.

1382
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,540
XPC is on the wall.

1383
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:05,680
He's on the big wall.

1384
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,240
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man.

1385
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:09,680
I'm okay.

1386
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,480
No.

1387
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,560
Not you, though.

1388
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:12,940
No.

1389
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:13,880
Oh, okay.

1390
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:14,980
I'm gonna get killed with this.

1391
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:15,580
Watch this.

1392
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,460
I'm getting big wall.

1393
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,200
Big wall down.

1394
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,540
Oh, goodbye.

1395
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:25,160
I have my ults here, but I don't know if I can.

1396
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:25,480
I'm chilling.

1397
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,170
They sold the ults in me.

1398
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,320
I lived.

1399
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:31,500
Nice.

1400
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,340
I'm back in there.

1401
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:33,840
Oh, that's fine.

1402
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,520
That's fine.

1403
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:39,220
Oh, oh, I died before a good one.

1404
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,040
Wait, gridlock, gridlock.

1405
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,020
I'm shooting.

1406
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,900
We almost have gambit all if you guys can hold.

1407
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:52,300
On their Deadpool?

1408
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:53,740
I have to reload.

1409
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,700
Wait, I'm spinning my...

1410
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,980
Oh, that's a lucky.

1411
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:01,380
Oh.

1412
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:05,380

01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,240

01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:11,720

1419
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:12,860

I can't see anything.

1428
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,400
They can't see anything.

1429
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,060
What's happening?

1430
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:52,460

Oh, no.

1437
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,780
Okay, I missed the violence.

1438
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,780
I'm ulting.

1439
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,460
Oh, I think I'm dead though.

1440
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:04,580
That's fine.

1441
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,280
We have injuries.

1442
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,200
There's a lot of colors on my screen.

1443
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,200
There's a lot of colors.

1444
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,580
There's so many colors on my screen.

1445
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,920
I stunned him.

1446
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,680
He can't play the game.

1447
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,960
Bougar can't play the game.

1448
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,400
We almost have Gambit on, guys.

1449
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,120
He's getting pissed off.

1450
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:23,320
I think he's a bubble.

1451
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,500
I couldn't tell him.

1452
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,340
Super support.

1453
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,400
He'll Bougar.

1454
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:27,740
Yay.

1455
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,300
Bougar's won.

1456
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,140
I'm slashing him.

1457
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:30,920
Oh my god.

1458
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:31,820
He won't go down.

1459
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:35,020
I stunned him again.

1460
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:36,500
I'm eating.

1461
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:37,700
I'm eating.

1462
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,400
It's okay.

1463
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,460
You're all okay.

1464
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:39,880
I'm dead.

1465
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,500
You're all healthy.

1466
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,380
Come on.

1467
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:42,460
Yes.

1468
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,100
No, too easy.

1469
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,580
Too easy.

1470
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,280
Too easy.

1471
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,280
Too easy.

1472
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,780
Thank God there's a melee form.

1473
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,800
Guys, I think triple support might still be a favorite.

1474
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,380
Yeah.

1475
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,060
Dude, why was it so colorful at the end there?

1476
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,420
Oh, because Deadpool all did.

1477
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,900
That's what Deadpool all looks like?

1478
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,060
That's the skins too.

1479
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,560
The skins changed the all.

1480
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,140
Deadpool ult and double invis ult with the music.

1481
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:15,840
Double invis, yeah.

1482
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,480
Yeah, yeah, so it's all the colors.

1483
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,160
It's like a purple one now.

1484
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:19,900
Yeah.

1485
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,600
And then if you're in too long in Deadpool, it hides your
UI.

1486
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,040
Oh my God.

1487
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:30,100
Yeah, so that you can't see your cooldowns.

1488
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,390
All right, I'm just gonna adjust this sound.

1489
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:43,090
Excuse me, what role would I mid-air collided them in my
ult?

1490
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:45,730
Nice.

1491
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,610
I actually can't tell if we'll watch around this.

1492
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:49,550
I don't think I do.

1493
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,730
I hope guys is the sound okay now.

1494
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:56,890
Someone said a Deadpool watch like a triple support and
visual clutter.

1495
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:57,650
Yeah.

1496
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:00,030
Look, look, did Walker on normally flat?

1497
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,770
He actually does look like a toy figurine.

1498
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:06,890
No.

1499
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:07,890
No.

1500
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:09,510
We don't get it.

1501
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,830
It's okay.

1502
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,590
We still have two supports.

1503
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:11,270
That's crazy.

1504
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:13,370
It's okay.

1505
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:14,410
We still have two supports.

1506
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:18,370
They're portaling, they're portaling, they're portaling,
they're portaling.

1507
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,730
Wait, they're actually trying to pour all you, Casey.

1508
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,610
No, no, they're a power out.

1509
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:25,670
Oh, they're sweating.

1510
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:27,630
Oh, they want the win.

1511
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:30,270
They got X on the strain.

1512
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:31,970
Foxy and the Hawkeye.

1513
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,950
Oh, he wants the win-win!

1514
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,890
I can't see what they're...

1515
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:37,990
Oh, no.

1516
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,350
It's okay, you're so healthy.

1517
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,550
I can live this.

1518
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:40,170
I can live this.

1519
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:41,150
I'm good, I'm good.

1520
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,110
I'm just baby Bruce.

1521
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:43,850
I'm throwing this onto them and see if it sprays them.

1522
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:49,370
I don't think all of them got back.

1523
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:51,890
I don't think that either.

1524
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:52,210
Oh.

1525
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,470
Oh, we gotta save our dead pool, guys.

1526
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:58,570
All right.

1527
01:27:58,690 --> 01:27:59,230
I got my form.

1528
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:00,050
I got my boat.

1529
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:00,390
We're good.

1530
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:01,230
All right.

1531
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:02,030
Nice, nice.

1532
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,350
Stunned the Bucky.

1533
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:07,790
Wait, they're on Mantis.

1534
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:09,770
They don't have a lot of heals.

1535
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,050
They don't have a lot of heals.

1536
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:12,690
One sec, one sec.

1537
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:13,330
Oh, I got rolled.

1538
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,110
I can't see you.

1539

01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,700

1594
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,340
Ciao, everyone.

1595
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,080
Yeah, see, we won the first.

1596
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:25,800
They're portal-like.

1597
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,740
Jay's on the Iron Man.

1598
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:27,040
Are they?

1599
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:27,980
Oh, yeah.

1600
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,820
They all waited and spawn, yeah.

1601
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,180
Where are they?

1602
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:31,960
Oh, high ground.

1603
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:32,960
They're ultimate high ground.

1604
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,300
Stop right, stop right, stop right.

1605
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:35,580
Whoa.

1606
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,380
I'm doing something stupid.

1607
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,300
I'm doing something stupid.

1608
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:38,480
Let's see it.

1609
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:39,920
Wait, I see it.

1610
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:40,620
I see the vision.

1611
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:41,300
No.

1612
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,860
That was a bad idea.

1613
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,020
You know, the vision was there.

1614
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:44,980
The vision was there.

1615
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,220
The war room chasing me.

1616
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,020
I'm stuck.

1617
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,360
What the hell?

1618
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,680
He has all, he's all, he's all.

1619
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,440
Wolverine is all pair.

1620
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,300
Alright, round two.

1621
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,780
One on the- Oh shit, it's okay, it's okay!

1622
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:05,840
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay,
everything is fine.

1623
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,340
Get him.

1624
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,240
Aw, they're the bad tusks!

1625
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,020
It's okay, see?

1626
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:16,880
The vision was there.

1627
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,180
I'm on KG.

1628
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:19,800
Nice.

1629
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:21,780
Oh,

1630
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,040
wait.

1631
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:26,660
He's a strategist.

1632
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,360
He has like the icon.

1633
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:28,840
Oh, wait.

1634
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,500
Is he on the strategist?

1635
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,080
Oh, he is.

1636
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,380
He's on the strategist.

1637
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:31,960
Yeah.

1638
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:33,680
Yeah.

1639
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,500
The strategist is Deadpool.

1640
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,400
I think DPS tank Deadpool is the strongest, though.

1641
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,260
Yeah, tank heals really good.

1642
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,400
Because you could get up to 800 HP.

1643
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:45,100
Come on, Angela.

1644
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:46,160
They're kidnapping him.

1645
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,640
Oh, you're fine.

1646
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:47,960
Oh, you're fine.

1647
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:48,480
We'll come back.

1648
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,580
Oh, my...

1649
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:52,940
Oh.

1650
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,100
Uh-oh.

1651
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,320
No, I got so old.

1652
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:55,940
It's okay.

1653
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,420
He tried to get me to, but I swam away.

1654
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,600
He's one on the...

1655
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,260
He's one HP.

1656
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,180
I just can't hit a shot.

1657
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,140
Oh, my God.

1658
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:06,820
I'm swimming away.

1659
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,140

01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,580
But he's coming for me.

Okay, maybe I should not have sent their tanks to the back
line.

1682
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,160
That might have been an oopsie.

01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:07,680
Wait, wait, wait.

1717
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,080
That's okay.

1718
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,480
I'm just insta down.

1719
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:12,920
It's okay.

1720
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:14,620
It's okay.

1721
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:15,220
It's okay.

1722
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,380
We just wanted a longer, longer lobby, you know?

1723
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,000
Three.

1724
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,180
To showcase everything more.

1725
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,020
Let's do it.

1726
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:35,220
A longer test run.

1727
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:35,640
True.

1728
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:37,500
Gotta make it interesting.

1729
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,600
Okay, I'm gonna kill someone with penny mines.

1730
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:40,760
And then I'll go back to part.

1731
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,100
Yeah, do it, do it, do it.

1732
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,480
The XQC might be the one dying.

1733
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,640
That guy's gonna walk through the garage for sure.

1734
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,140
You can make a clip.

1735
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:54,600
The prophecy has been foretold.

1736
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,780
Round three.

1737
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:13,490
30 seconds before you attack.

1738
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:14,250
Get ready.

1739
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:20,010
We're getting a kill.

1740
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:21,450
He hits us.

1741
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:22,490
It's coming, it's coming.

1742
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,050
Yeah, I'm waiting.

1743
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,380
Is that a new one going through the garage?

1744
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,240

Cool.

1761
01:38:57,410 --> 01:38:59,070
We can do Sharknado when I get mine.

1762
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:00,530
Mm-hmm.

1763
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:01,030
Mm-hmm.

1764
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:02,830
I'm gonna hold it.

1765
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:03,550
Yeah.

1766
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:04,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1767
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:05,050
Okay.

1768
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:08,010
If I don't get it in time, you can use it.

1769
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:08,570
I'm Groot.

1770
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,450
Oh!

1771
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:10,770
Oh!

1772
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:11,670
Oh!

1773
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:12,010
Oh!

1774
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:13,810
Oh, they might go fast.

1775
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:15,130
Yeah, you might have to use it.

1776
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:15,930
Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:17,210
I'm going to hold it for a sec.

1778
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:19,350
I'm asleep.

1779
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:20,770
I'm going to try to block his screen.

1780
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:21,690
No.

1781
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:22,870
It's not working.

1782
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:26,250
Wait, wait, no, it's not working.

1783
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:27,010
No.

1784
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:28,690
We have embezzled.

1785
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,710
Oh, God.

1786
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:31,210
No.

1787
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:33,370
No, it was a good push though.

1788
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:33,810
It was a good push.

1789
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:34,810
That was a good push.

1790
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:34,950
That was good.

1791
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:36,710
That was good.

1792
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:38,310
That was unfortunate.

1793
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:40,110
The moxie headshot.

1794
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:41,890
That's crazy.

1795
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:42,210
That's it.

1796
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,610
That can be win.

1797
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:47,790
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1798
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:52,470
We got a fast push, so it's winnable.

1799
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:54,330
Mm-hmm.

1800
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:58,370
Okay, don't go through garage.

1801
01:39:58,570 --> 01:39:59,690
This guy's going to do a penny lineup.

1802
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:08,610
I think OT, by the way, your thing carries over, but you
don't have like maxed out.

1803
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:10,810
I don't know if it's from like the defensive round or what.

1804
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:13,070
That's interesting.

1805
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:16,830
Wait, so like when we started on defense, you had like
different things?

1806
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:17,870
You started over?

1807
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:20,650
Yeah, I had so like we started off there.

1808
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,930
Wait, wait, wait.

1809
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:26,810
Oh, OK, well, now I can buy everything.

1810
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:27,330
That's weird.

1811
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:28,370
OK, weird.

1812
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:32,830
When we went on attack, I had most of my stuff, but not
everything.

1813
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:35,710
And then I had to buy like two or three things.

1814
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:36,230
Wait, but they're here.

1815
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:36,550
They're here.

1816
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,230
I could buy everything.

1817
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:38,590
Yeah, yeah.

1818
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:39,430
I cleared and bow.

1819
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,170
Oh, they're back.

1820
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:41,790
It's okay.

1821
01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:43,470
Sean would have been the victim there, buddy.

1822
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:44,310
I would have definitely.

1823
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,470
I'm moving along, guys.

1824
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:45,690
Don't worry.

1825
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:47,030
I was just reading chat, not paying attention.

1826
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:47,950
Thank you.

1827
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,430
I'm moving the line.

1828
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:50,910
Don't worry.

1829
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:52,410
I know their schemes.

1830
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:54,590
No more, no more mines.

1831
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,830
No.

1832
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:56,450
Oh.

1833
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:59,510
Three, two, one.

1834
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:02,770
You have to stop them from securing the lane.

1835
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:04,790
Are they poor lane, Sean?

1836
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:06,930
Oh, no, no, no.

1837
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:07,210
Yes.

1838
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:09,610
Oh, no, they are.

1839
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:10,090
Oh, they are.

1840
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:11,050
They are there.

1841
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:13,630
Wait, care, top side care.

1842
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:13,870
Yep.

1843
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:14,410
Might be TP.

1844
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,590
Oh, they're here.

1845
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:16,850
They're here.

1846
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:17,170
They're here.

1847
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:17,870
Okay.

1848
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:23,290
They'll be flat, so I'll try.

1849
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:25,010
Uh-oh.

1850
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,550
Don't get headshot.

1851
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:33,930
Oh, no!

1852
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:36,190
No, Moxie's too good.

1853
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:37,510
He got headshot!

1854
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:38,310
Trying to blind him.

1855
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:39,510
He's just too good.

1856
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,230
No.

1857
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:42,930
Oh, God.

1858
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:45,450

Did it feel fun the DPS is that cool?

1865
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:51,320
At least?

1866
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,300
Oh yeah, how was that?

1867
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:56,220

So I couldn't, honestly couldn't tell you.

1869
01:42:59,160 --> 01:42:59,680
Okay.

01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,780
It's, you know, you got the effort.

1871
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,440
It's the effort.

1872
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:03,600
Yeah.

1873
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,500
Okay, I had one good Jeff up.

1874
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:16,200
I had one good Jeff up.

1875
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:22,020
the other two killed my team but other than that i had one
good job

1876
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:38,440
i didn't die with alt though okay i didn't get i didn't die
by a headshot from from moxie though you guys want to try to

1877
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:47,240
you want to try to share deadpool here like i play him for
like i don't know one alt or something and the swap with

1878
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:52,540
somebody yeah maybe sure yeah i can play maf i feel like
we're not gonna have no time to get everybody to like yeah

1879
01:43:52,540 --> 01:44:03,760
that's true so yeah okay that went so long i played for one
headshot maybe one maybe one point up and then next point

1880
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:09,600
and it died with up because i got headshot yeah i can stop
with you headshot yeah you should definitely check between

1881
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,640
rounds up um like your your thing carries over I'm curious.

1882
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:15,860
Yeah.

1883
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,940
I'm curious too.

1884
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:19,960
So in the...

1885
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:26,400
Look, see, Saipi, who is a rank 1 to 6 player, couldn't even
survive.

1886
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,580
So checkmate.

1887
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,740
I lived longer.

1888
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,080
No, I just didn't have the Lady Loki skin on.

1889
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,420
Because he got headshot twice.

1890
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,160
And that means it happens to everybody.

You got past one.

2067
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:41,710
And I can do this.

2068
01:55:44,450 --> 01:55:45,530
I can't see anything.

2069
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:46,370
Yeah.

01:55:47,290 --> 01:55:47,690

2073
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:52,390
Wait, wait.

2074
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:52,790
He's slow.

2075
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:54,390
You're fine.

2076
01:55:54,650 --> 01:55:54,750
You're fine.

2077
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:55,810
You're so healthy.

2078
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:57,210
See?

2079
01:55:58,770 --> 01:55:59,110
Fun?

2080
01:55:59,370 --> 01:55:59,850
I know.

2081
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:00,470
That's personal.

2082
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:01,510
Oh my god.

2083
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:05,550
Does that mean I can start redecorating it now?

2084
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:06,030
Oh.

2085
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:11,760
Oh.

2086
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:13,280
Someone's all right.

2087
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:13,760
Yeah.

2088
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:14,300
Who's that?

2089
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,240
I'm pretty sure they have.

2090
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:20,040
Oh, yeah.

2091
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:20,360
Gambit.

2092
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:22,100
He's low.

2093
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:22,900
He's low.

2094
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:23,800
He's low.

2095
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,220
You're so healthy.

2096
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,380
Oh, yeah.

2097
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:29,980
It's really fast.

2098
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:31,040
We have this.

2099
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:32,060
Never mind.

2100
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:32,520
We died.

2101
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:33,180
Oh, I saw that.

2102
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:33,700
Oh, God.

2103
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:36,660
Never mind.

2104
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:38,000
The lambs, bro.

2105
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,960
We had three lambs, but it didn't matter.

2106
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,100
Where is the grid ult?

2107
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:48,780
Oh, he's coming for you.

2108
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:49,760
He's coming for you, Shroud.

2109
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:50,900
You're all coming.

2110
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:51,520
Oh, goodbye.

2111
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:55,460
J.

2112
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:56,220
I'm everywhere.

2113
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:02,320
J.

2114
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:02,840
Are they throwing Wolverine?

2115
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,620
Where is he?

2116
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,020
He's right side.

2117
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:06,380
Right side.

2118
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:11,960
Oh my, I don't know if you get this.

2119
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:13,080
Okay.

2120
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:20,770
There's a lot of stuff going on our screens right now.

2121
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:23,890
I don't have Involve.

2122
01:57:24,190 --> 01:57:25,170
I don't have...

2123
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:28,670
All right, well, I'll kill one.

2124
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:30,850
I'm dead though.

2125
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:31,850
One out of five.

2126
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:34,530
I do have ult soon.

2127
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:34,930
Let me stop.

2128
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:35,310
Let me stop.

2129
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:36,370
I don't know.

2130
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,180
Their team's capture progress has passed a halfway point.

2131
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:53,220
Right side starlord.

2132
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:57,860
We're long in time.

2133
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:58,820
I got him.

2134
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:02,650
Okay.

2135
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:04,650
I should live through this.

2136
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:06,570
I pulled back Wolf.

2137
01:58:08,170 --> 01:58:09,110
Wolf in your back, Wolf.

2138
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:10,610
Yeah, Wolf's in the back of the eye.

2139
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:17,320
What the?

2140
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,120
I'm stuck in the wolf.

2141
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:19,420
Yeah, I was gonna stay weird.

2142
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:22,140
I don't have it yet.

2143
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,120
Hang on.

2144
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:24,820
No!

2145
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:28,740
Jesus, Hawk is low.

2146
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,020
Oh my god, he grabbed me off.

2147
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:32,580
Oh no.

2148
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:36,280
Is that him all?

2149
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:37,620
We'll bind, we'll bind, we'll bind.

2150
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:38,640
We get one, we get one.

2151
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:39,380
He's one, he's one, he's one.

2152
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:39,720
Very winnable.

2153
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,540
Yeah, yeah.

2154
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,680
I'm on Gambit now, so it could be winnable.

2155
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,300
Oh, we got this then.

2156
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:49,500
Um...

2157
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:50,620
I can't get him.

2158
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:52,080
Come on, I can't get him.

2159
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:52,680
Come on, I can't get him.

2160
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,000
No time for a pay-do-do.

2161
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,240
We still got work to do.

2162
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:55,920
Then

2163
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,840
half of the mission area, keep going.

2164
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:16,030
Bring a wall.

2165
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:16,950
Yeah.

2166
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:19,730
We don't have anything for that.

2167
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:20,190
I'm dead.

2168
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,130
They're all on me.

2169
01:59:25,530 --> 01:59:25,830
Oh, yeah.

2170
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:26,950
They all ran at me.

2171
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:28,090
Oh, my.

2172
01:59:28,890 --> 01:59:29,370
Jesus.

2173
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:31,370
Yeah, it's just the gambit.

2174
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:35,070
Let me try a die point or something.

2175
01:59:35,690 --> 01:59:36,930
Oh, I'm going to need to TP.

2176
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:37,970
Yeah.

2177
01:59:41,510 --> 01:59:43,970
Oh, I don't know if you'll live, but we're trying.

2178
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:44,530
Oh yeah, you'll live!

2179
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:47,170
You'll live, you'll live, you'll live, you'll live!

2180
01:59:47,450 --> 01:59:47,950
Are you going crazy?

2181
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:48,330
Drudge!

2182
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:50,630
Oh my God!

2183
01:59:50,670 --> 01:59:53,130
I tried so hard to keep you alive.

2184
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:54,610
Okay, yeah, that was crazy.

2185
01:59:55,490 --> 01:59:57,050
Good and, well, maybe.

2186
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:58,290
I can't help you.

2187
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:59,490
Oh my God, I'm mean, no!

2188
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:01,230
Yeah, they're on our supports.

2189
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:02,870
We...

2190
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:03,510
Wait, Flats got that!

2191
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:04,090
You got pushed.

2192
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:04,850
I got pushed up!

2193
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:06,050
The push!

2194
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:06,410
Ah...

2195
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:06,890
They just try.

2196
02:00:07,770 --> 02:00:08,170
Ah.

2197
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:10,270
Their just try.

2198
02:00:26,150 --> 02:00:34,150
it was close that was close though no we just yeah the
support back line just was like there was nothing you do

2199
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:46,310
with gambit all it's like unless you have a counter support
like you're you're not gonna live it was unfortunate why not

2200
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:53,190
that image and he did so well not obviously That's good,
Paul Gale.

2201
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:54,630
It was good.

2202
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:56,270
No, I think he's really strong.

2203
02:00:56,870 --> 02:01:00,410
I was just, uh, brute and will vaulted basically every
fight.

2204
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:01,370
Yeah.

2205
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:03,250
That didn't really help my case.

2206
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:07,030
Yeah, all good though.

2207
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:09,890
Yeah, no, he's, uh, he's really in my opinion.

2208
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:11,490
Really good.

2209
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:14,230
He doesn't have much follow-up right on his guns.

2210
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,110
So you can do pretty good damage even on Grinch.

2211
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:17,050
Yeah.

2212
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:19,290
It's like, it's kind of like Hella, no?

2213
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:22,650
Like Hella Phoenix a little bit The projectiles are actually
as well.

2214
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:28,190
And like, I honestly think you ult on his guns and then swap
to his blades after.

2215
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:29,630
Because like...

2216
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:31,290
The gun is the one where they miss, they take damage, right?

2217
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:32,490
Yeah, yeah.

2218
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:35,030
All right, support gamutad.

2219
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:35,710
I think that's the plan.

2220
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:37,650
Well, who do you put it on?

2221
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:40,950
What's that?

2222
02:01:41,610 --> 02:01:43,850
When you were targeting one person, who did you put it on?

2223
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:46,610
Oh, I would just look at their DPS.

2224
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:48,210
Oh, okay.

2225
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:50,610
Well, I'd be a nice person who gives sight bait.

2226
02:01:50,890 --> 02:01:58,170
gambit one time i'm not gonna start i put it on gambit or do
i take yeah like gambit misses a lot of abilities right sure

2227
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:09,290
all right let's see who's fastest my strategy die first and
gg no heal go oh well you're gonna try to heal okay

2228
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:16,430
i'll do one round and then either cypher case he can do the
next one

2229
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:35,580
i think it's better to be the second deadpool so you can get
all my all the skills all the xp true yeah royal blade is

2230
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:42,320
this a new team up or is this one in the game with magnito

I don't have how far on.

2236
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:30,540
I don't blame Magneto.

2237
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,060
No, it's fine.

2238
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:38,320
My character literally dies so fast.

2239
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:41,760
Wait, I have ult already?

2431
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:18,480
I can't see anything.

2432
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:20,780
I assume shit as well.

2433
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:22,540
No, we lost his support.

2434
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:24,860
Wait, uh...

2435
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:30,190

02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:48,960
Come on, man.

2443
02:14:49,180 --> 02:14:51,860
Now we can have the third support, Deadpool.

2444
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:53,360
Huge.

2445
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:54,620
Huge.

2446
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:06,420
his bullets are so small yeah yeah i agree they are yeah
yeah i'd be very precise but like i don't think headshots

2447
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:16,880
give more heals though okay so what is this character what
does rogue do can i get a rundown uh so your f like takes

2448
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:24,240
other people's abilities um you only get like one of them so
like for strange for example you'll like take a shield uh

2449
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:31,620
for like mantis to take her sleep and so on her E, you like
dash into them, kick them up in the air and then boop them

2450
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:37,260
down on the ground and then for the next two attacks you
have like a ranged like kick attack that does damage.

2451
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:42,920
And then your shift is you dash forward and then you click
shift again and it creates a circle around you that pulls

2452
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,880
enemies towards you.

2453
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:50,060
And also the block, if you block and then hit left click,
you like do a shoulder bash.

2454
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:52,780
Holy crap.

2455
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:55,940
Oh, this is the Spider-Man.

What was the day he is?

2462
02:16:38,780 --> 02:16:40,480
They used it.

2463
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:43,520
I think they have everything.

2464
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:45,940
Yeah, I don't think they used anything.

2465
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:51,920
Oh, I saved you, but you can't get saved a second time.

2466
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:54,760
Wait, they did wall.

2467

What is that?

2475
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:35,640
I can't see anything.

2476
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:36,460
I can't see anything.

2477
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:37,420
What is happening?

2478
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:39,180
Yeah, that was insane.

2479
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:44,280
Everything is happening.

2480
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:47,660
Yo, that looked crazy.

2481
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:50,740
That was roguel dare to fall.

2482
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:52,680
You can't really see anything.

2483
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,380
Yeah, I backed away.

2484
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:00,320
That was a little bit too much.

2485
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:01,500
Spider-Man right side gun for full.

2486
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:04,160
He missed.

2487
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:10,360
Oh, no.

2488
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:13,920
We got different ones.

2489
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:14,540
I want them.

2490
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:15,960
I'm dead.

2491
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:17,200
Bye, everyone.

2492
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:18,780
I'm swimming away.

2493
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,080
I'm swimming away.

2494
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:22,180
No, I couldn't.

2495
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:22,380
Oh.

2496
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:24,040
All right.

2497
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:24,580
I can TP.

2498
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:28,240
Can we though they're all like there?

2499
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:30,360
He ping?

2500
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:32,380
Oh god, he's gonna stun me.

2501
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:33,000
That's okay.

2502
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:34,780
I'm giving you heals.

2503
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:35,040
Oh god.

2504
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:35,760
No!

2505
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:37,300
It's not okay!

2506
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:40,740
It's not okay.

2507
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,180
I almost had it.

2508
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:48,200
Oh yeah, you could turn the visual effects off on the
settings.

2509
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:50,180
I'm definitely gonna turn that off.

2510
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:52,820
For like scenes and stuff.

2511
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:53,860
Yeah, yeah.

2512
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:56,120
When there's everyone skins on there.

2513
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,140
That's what...

2514
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:00,320
so many particles as well.

2515
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:03,440
Like, whenever he's, like, the sword is out, you're at the
right click that you, like, throw.

2516
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:06,540
Like, there's so many things happening.

2517
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:10,280
Yeah, yeah, that's why I was like, I'm just going to press
buttons.

2518
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:13,040
I...

2519
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:13,680
Yeah, that's crazy.

2520
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:18,220
I feel like Season 7 needs to take a step into clarity,
maybe.

2521
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:19,980
Visual clarity.

2522
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:20,560
I don't know.

2523
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:22,520
It's getting kind of fucking crazy.

2524
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,280
The clutter was insane.

2525
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:26,220
No, for sure.

2526
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:27,060
It was nuts.

2527
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:28,580
I think...

2528
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:29,020
Is that it?

2529
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:30,760
Yeah, I think so.

2530
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:31,540
He stopped it.

2531
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:32,160
I think so.

2532
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:34,620
You get a chance to do the all Deadpool though.

2533
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:37,740
But I think it's just the games were really long.

2534
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:39,100
Yeah.

2535
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:42,580
That was fun.

2536
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,140
That was fun.

2537
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:44,580
At least we were about to play Deadpool 1.

2538
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,180
At least one thing.

2539
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:46,800
I think so.

2540
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:47,140
Yeah.

2541
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,040
I think all of us got turned.

2542
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:48,480
That's good.

2543
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:51,040
Wait, so we do the free for all now?

2544
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:53,020
I think we're no, I think it's just done.

2545
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,800
I think we went over so.

2546
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,120
Well, they will they.

2547
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:02,240
They're in the other thing, re-roll Deadpool.

2548
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,160
They're in the other lobby.

2549
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:05,380
Hmm.

2550
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:08,080
I don't know if they're doing one more or not.

2551
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:08,680
I'm not sure.

2552
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,880
I think like, well, are the other teams still there?

2553
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:15,020
Or are they all left?

2554
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:17,720
Uh...

2555
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:20,240
Moxie and Jay are here.

2556
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:22,100
Everyone else left, I think.

2557
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:25,620
Yeah, I think I think it's GG's.

2558
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:29,140
Oh, XQC is literally already reacting to content.

2559
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:40,220
he's literally gone he's on youtube right now he's on
youtube he's like he's done he literally gone that is funny

right we're still playing though we're so we're still going

2563
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:17,440
i'm just gonna boot up the other marvel rivals build um
thoughts deadpool is so confusing i was literally button

2564
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:32,140
mashing at the at that point i uh it is i felt like i was
just what the fuck i was doing because like it gets so

2565
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:41,720
overwhelming when you're like actually playing deadpool in
the game um i just i don't know how to do it i was like when

2566
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:56,880
katana or pistol oh katana pistol oh i died dead i think
yeah it's harder because like only his pistol heals unless

2567
02:21:56,880 --> 02:22:03,900
you slash enemies oh my god and when I don't know but his
ult his ult look it's he's but like it's doo-doo I can't

2568
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:12,920
tell his ult feels pretty like like doo-doo also the gail
the me and gail curse continues to live on I think when me

2569
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:19,320
and gail are on a team together we just don't win like I
don't know like it's just a curse I don't I think it's like

2570
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:29,160
it's both of us like we like curse each other like like me
and gail as a team together with all and then for some

2571
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:35,800
fucking reason they always put us together we're like
tournament he's a good player but like when we both are

2572
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:44,580
together we like cancel each other out like we like cancel
each other out because every like and then for some fucking

2573
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:50,380
reason it's like tournaments too that we get match paired up
together like we're the failure Like whenever we're both

2574
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:58,580
together on the same team and, like, we have a 0% win rate
with all the tournaments and sponsored previews we've done

2575
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:02,140
together is weirdly 0%.

2576
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:08,840
I don't know how, I don't know why.

2577
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:09,720
I don't know.

2578
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:13,280
We just, we, and we've done a lot together, too.

2579
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:18,140
We had like three tournaments together and like two
sponsored previews together.

2580
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:22,880
And we have a 0% win rate as a team.

2581
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:25,440
I will, no, no, Moxie's team was pretty stacked.

2582
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:32,260
Everyone on our team are like, they're all top 500 except
for XQC, I believe.

2583
02:23:32,580 --> 02:23:35,120
Everyone on that team is top 500 except for XQC.

2584
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:40,040
And I think only on my team, it's only Gail and Saipay, I
believe.

2585
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:44,640
I think it is like Gail and Saipay that's top 500, like top
500.

Where did he go?

2722
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:28,580
I wasn't okay.

2723
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:35,080
The thing is, that is easily counterable, but not in
Celestial 1.

2724
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:37,140
Not in Celestial.

2725
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:40,320
These Celestial players don't know what to do.

2726
02:36:45,650 --> 02:36:46,470
They're confused.

2727
02:36:49,010 --> 02:36:49,930
Oh my god, he back.

2728
02:36:50,470 --> 02:36:50,950
He back.

2729
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:57,390
He surprisingly has a lot less depth than he should.

2730
02:36:59,750 --> 02:37:00,890
There we go.

2731
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:05,370
That's all he's been doing this for like five seasons.

2732
02:37:06,990 --> 02:37:07,490
I think.

2733
02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:10,930
He's been doing it for five fucking...

2734
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:12,110
Jesus Christ.

2735
02:37:12,410 --> 02:37:14,570
I did all I could.

2736
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:19,430
Bro, okay.

2737
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:22,530
Like, what can I do?

2738
02:37:22,790 --> 02:37:23,090
He literally...

2739
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:23,910
runs at us.

2740
02:37:27,150 --> 02:37:29,290
I threw my stick.

2741
02:37:32,390 --> 02:37:33,350
Please respond.

2742
02:37:42,030 --> 02:37:43,150
I throw my stick.

2743
02:37:43,550 --> 02:37:44,250
Please respond.

2744
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:50,600
I have a few.

2745
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:51,620
Nope, there he is.

2746
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:56,120
I knew it.

2747
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:56,580
I knew it.

2748
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:57,100
I knew it.

2749
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:57,960
I fucking knew it.

2750
02:37:58,200 --> 02:37:58,680
I was like.

2751
02:37:58,780 --> 02:37:59,180
He's sick.

2752
02:37:59,200 --> 02:37:59,720
Somewhere.

2753
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:01,100
She's somewhere.

2754
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:05,540
I was trying to find a rest.

2755
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:07,740
What is that crosshair?

2756
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:09,640
Bro, I literally...

2757
02:38:09,640 --> 02:38:12,280
There was no reason for him to be there, but he is here.

2758
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:14,140
I was trying to figure out...

2759
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:15,340
I was like, okay, I should put my rest.

2760
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:20,040
I literally got fucked over because I wanted to put my rest
down.

2761
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:23,660
I just wanted to put my rest down.

2762
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,720
That's how unlucky I was.

2763
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:43,940
that rollout should be that's what he does but he's like but
he he's always hard like not hard stuck but like he goes up

2764
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:55,240
and down very crazily because um you can count on me i got a
plan ah bless me because like it's not sustainable because

2765
02:38:55,240 --> 02:39:08,240
he can get easily countered by um by the higher elo the high
elo is very easy to counter get ready You are too sick.

2766
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:15,700
On Mag.

2767
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:18,740
Yeah, it's cool.

2768
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:20,240
Ravos never changes.

2769
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:21,540
I will...

2770
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:27,260
Ravos being Ravos.

2771
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:30,960
Four, three, two, one.

2772
02:39:31,660 --> 02:39:34,340
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

2773
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:35,220
Got it?

2774
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:38,780
Who is he playing now, Venom?

2775
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:40,880
Oh, maybe he's a Venom player.

2776
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:45,060
It is last day of comp.

2777
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:48,820
We have Iron Man.

2778
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:50,260
This is last day of comp.

2779
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:51,280
That's okay.

2780
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,340
I'm not swapping off Rocket.

2781
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:57,100
This does not look fun to play if I'm not Rocket.

2782
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:01,920
Wait, how did like...

2783
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:04,440
How did the Iron Man not...

2784
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:05,340
Wait.

2785
02:40:06,260 --> 02:40:08,760
How did the Iron Man not get my res?

2786
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:11,580
I literally put it down before he died.

2787
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:18,040
I think our Iron Man did more as...

2788
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:21,040
Definitely more as...

2789
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,520
Hello, than Iron Man.

2790
02:40:23,980 --> 02:40:25,740
But I don't think he's playing anymore.

2791
02:40:30,620 --> 02:40:33,000
Our other tank was more of a tank.

2792
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,060
To be fair, we have Moon Knight.

2793
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:40,760
To be fair, I don't think we even have, like, a comp.

2794
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:45,880
Like, why?

2795
02:40:51,160 --> 02:40:51,740
Hello,

2796
02:40:54,900 --> 02:40:56,760
so there is a story on foot.

2797
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:58,800
But don't worry, we're coming back.

2798
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:01,100
I'm extra lethal.

2799
02:41:02,380 --> 02:41:04,700
I don't think we have a real team.

2800
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,020
Like, everyone's playing.

2801
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:20,880
mystery hero at this point like this feels very mystery hero
this doesn't feel like real players like a cop i don't think

2802
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:37,100
we're playing a real cop like who is on point that's
preventing us from i mean okay this is real what is I'm not

2803
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:38,060
on it.

2804
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:46,940
Oh my god, get me out of here.

2805
02:41:47,680 --> 02:41:48,880
Get me out of here.

2806
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:51,060
Ah, is he still on the point?

2807
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:56,340
Alright, here we go.

2808
02:41:57,820 --> 02:41:57,980
Yeah.

2809
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:02,720
Yeah.

2810
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:06,040
Oh!

2811
02:42:07,700 --> 02:42:09,080
There she's rolled up.

2812
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:09,840
He's doing his...

2813
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:11,360
How?

2814
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:25,180
Oh my god, please, for the love of God, at least let me be
alive.

2815
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:33,760
I don't know yet, but I do feel like it's a hate crime.

2816
02:42:39,510 --> 02:42:40,210
All right.

2817
02:42:41,810 --> 02:42:43,090
I'm not sure yet.

2818
02:42:43,290 --> 02:42:45,250
I feel like I'm getting targeted.

2819
02:42:46,890 --> 02:42:49,110
I have Lord on almost all supports.

2820
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:51,990
Except for...

2821
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:53,090
Can we all not have Gambit?

2822
02:42:53,890 --> 02:42:54,870
Gambit and Jeff.

2823
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:58,530
Those are the only supports I don't have Lord on.

2824
02:43:02,130 --> 02:43:02,530
What?

2825
02:43:03,090 --> 02:43:08,450
There's no... I was gonna say, if he gets a kill there, then
like, what ELO am I in?

2826
02:43:11,150 --> 02:43:15,930
The issue is, well, I guess I'll just...

2827
02:43:15,930 --> 02:43:17,750
Okay, there's no way.

2828
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:23,250
Yeah, I was like, there's...

2829
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:24,150
I don't know where to go.

2830
02:43:24,350 --> 02:43:25,830
This guy was following me.

2831
02:43:27,710 --> 02:43:28,630
I have...

2832
02:43:28,630 --> 02:43:29,330
Oh, no, I don't know.

2833
02:43:29,570 --> 02:43:29,930
What?

2834
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:31,770
I don't know.

2835
02:43:32,150 --> 02:43:36,190
Adam's legs have been, like, cracked in half so many times
that...

2836
02:43:36,190 --> 02:43:37,950
We are undefeatable!

2837
02:43:39,150 --> 02:43:39,890
It's okay.

2838
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:42,810
If he comes after me, I have the Angela.

2839
02:43:43,490 --> 02:43:44,470
I have the Mantis.

2840
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:45,090
There you go.

2841
02:43:46,190 --> 02:43:47,610
Oh, that is unlucky.

2842
02:43:49,330 --> 02:43:49,910
Why?

2843
02:43:52,850 --> 02:43:53,430
Why?

2844
02:43:56,030 --> 02:43:57,570
Like, get out of here.

2845
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:01,430
Oh my god.

2846
02:44:02,890 --> 02:44:04,890
I thought I had someone still... It's okay.

2847
02:44:04,970 --> 02:44:06,390
I get to be freed from this.

2848
02:44:09,070 --> 02:44:19,750
get to be I get to get out of this lobby we didn't want to
play another rat anyway no I I might have to avoid three

2849
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:22,470
people on my team

2850
02:44:25,850 --> 02:44:34,270
and toothless because I bro no the thing is it's a gamble I
don't want to gamble the back line and shotgun punish here

2851
02:44:34,270 --> 02:44:43,130
only because it is a gamble he is good but it's so 50-50
unless you get like a good like a player that Like, he can-

2852
02:44:43,130 --> 02:44:45,030
he is very easily counterable.

2853
02:44:48,770 --> 02:44:51,590
He is very easily counterable.

2854
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:54,850
Okay.

2855
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:56,230
What?

2856
02:45:02,290 --> 02:45:02,770
Alright.

2857
02:45:03,130 --> 02:45:04,630
Oh, wait, I'm back in my lane.

2858
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:05,470
Yay!

2859
02:45:07,290 --> 02:45:08,690
No, this is not good.

2860
02:45:08,790 --> 02:45:10,110
I gotta pick a better place.

2861
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:12,190
How did it take me straight here?

2862
02:45:12,650 --> 02:45:13,670
In Times Square.

2863
02:45:14,970 --> 02:45:15,970

Gomez, you're not even...

2881
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:00,700

TikTok.

White rabbit.

2890
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:19,740
Let's do it.

2891
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:20,660
Sorry, Gomez.

2892
02:47:22,300 --> 02:47:24,260

I'm sorry.

2894
02:47:29,400 --> 02:47:31,500
It's first come, first serve.

2895
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:35,840
Buy his wig.

2897
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:43,060
Lacey, thank you for the 20 gifted, bro.

2898
02:47:43,180 --> 02:47:44,660
He's paying a win.

2899
02:47:45,380 --> 02:47:47,700
Gomez, thank you for the 20 gifted subs.

I really appreciate it, guys.

2906
02:47:57,540 --> 02:47:58,000
They turned it.

2907
02:47:58,260 --> 02:48:04,480
Bro, Lacey's not even, like, like, part of the, like, the
Moxie versus Gomez fight.

2908
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:09,640
Unless he's fighting for Moxie.

2909
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:13,780
They're actually fighting.

2910
02:48:15,100 --> 02:48:17,580
He's not even on, guys.

2911
02:48:22,540 --> 02:48:23,460
Yeah, that's Moxie's out.

2912
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:25,200
He's doing it for the love of the game.

2913
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:28,500
Bro, I was just saying, first come, we're equal here.

2914
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:31,240
Check this card.

2915
02:48:31,300 --> 02:48:33,460

3025
02:57:26,940 --> 02:57:30,880
I just can't be bothered having two separate voice thingies.

3026
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:33,440
It feels very inconvenient.

3027
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:37,220
There's no reason to.

3028
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:40,040
Oh, shit.

3029
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:40,300

02:57:54,940 --> 02:58:00,920
I already made all the... Okay, he's gonna have a reset, but
That is not my fault.

3039
02:58:01,900 --> 02:58:03,720
I might have to swap off then.

3040
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:06,180
I legitimately...

3041
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:06,520
Nice.

3042
02:58:08,060 --> 02:58:09,040
He doesn't have shit.

3043
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:12,120
I have to swap off Loki.

3044
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:14,340
I know I'm sorry, everyone.

3045
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:18,300
We might have to swap off Loki and go Invis.

3046
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:24,240
Alright, let's go!

3047
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:26,940
Alright, let's go!

3048
02:58:27,300 --> 02:58:27,940
Walk, walk, walk!

3049
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:29,660
Shit, I didn't get two people in, but fuck it.

3050
02:58:30,980 --> 02:58:32,560
I'll run it out, I'll run it out.

3051
02:58:33,020 --> 02:58:33,920
It's fine.

3052
02:58:36,220 --> 02:58:38,000
Where is everybody?

3053
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:41,660
Alright, I'll put this out.

3054
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:45,580
Alright, and then this is not good.

3055
02:58:46,720 --> 02:58:48,380
This is not good.

3056
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:52,520
What?

3057
02:58:53,500 --> 02:58:55,740
Oh my god, what happened to me?

3058
02:58:59,470 --> 02:59:00,810
I don't even...

3059
02:59:00,810 --> 02:59:01,250
Oh, it's fine.

3060
02:59:01,330 --> 02:59:02,630
I wanted to swap off.

3061
02:59:03,350 --> 02:59:04,690
I got exploded.

3062
02:59:05,750 --> 02:59:06,950
That's crazy.

3063
02:59:07,850 --> 02:59:08,970
I didn't even...

3064
02:59:10,230 --> 02:59:11,070
Where is he?

3065
02:59:12,170 --> 02:59:13,370
Oh no.

3066
02:59:16,010 --> 02:59:17,330
I was like, where's our rocket?

3067
02:59:19,390 --> 02:59:20,910
I didn't even know what happened to me.

3068
02:59:20,990 --> 02:59:22,490
I got exploded so fast.

3069
02:59:22,650 --> 02:59:27,070
All right, let me fucking grab my squad, push the talk.

3070
02:59:27,830 --> 02:59:28,850
Where is that?

3071
02:59:31,510 --> 02:59:32,130
What?

3072
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:34,590
How do you...

3073
02:59:34,590 --> 02:59:36,230
Wait, how does this work?

3074
02:59:37,650 --> 02:59:38,230
Oh!

02:59:46,430 --> 02:59:48,510

Alright.

3081
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:05,090
That's crazy.

3082
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:07,030
Little did you know I was throwing.

3083
03:00:10,170 --> 03:00:12,430
Literally did you know I threw.

3084
03:00:14,350 --> 03:00:16,330
I was throwing.

3085
03:00:17,590 --> 03:00:23,330
I played Rocket.

3086
03:00:25,730 --> 03:00:25,870
Okay.

3087
03:00:27,210 --> 03:00:30,750
Yeah, when everyone is throwing, no one is.

3088
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:35,890
Okay, I have not played in a while, though.

3089
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:39,830
Jesus, everybody.

3090
03:00:45,570 --> 03:00:46,290
Everyone is...

3091
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:49,620
Oh, he stopped.

3092
03:00:49,760 --> 03:00:50,120
He fucked it up.

3093
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:50,800
He fucked it up.

3094
03:00:52,460 --> 03:00:53,020
We're dead.

3095
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:54,040
We're dead.

3096
03:00:54,640 --> 03:00:55,700
It doesn't matter.

3097
03:00:56,020 --> 03:00:56,460
We're dead.

3098
03:00:58,100 --> 03:00:58,420
Alright, guys.

3099
03:00:58,460 --> 03:00:59,260
They just used a lot of ults.

3100
03:00:59,360 --> 03:01:00,220
Do not say GG.

3101
03:01:01,720 --> 03:01:02,540
They just used ults.

3102
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:03,260
That's all it was.

3103
03:01:03,920 --> 03:01:06,080
Yeah, yeah, it's winnable.

3104
03:01:06,320 --> 03:01:06,780
It's winnable.

3105
03:01:07,720 --> 03:01:08,480
I believe.

3106
03:01:12,790 --> 03:01:15,110
Oh, it might not be.

3107
03:01:15,110 --> 03:01:15,750
Jacob, relax, man.

3108
03:01:16,070 --> 03:01:16,070
Relax.

3109
03:01:16,270 --> 03:01:17,110
We're getting way too wild.

3110
03:01:18,230 --> 03:01:18,830
Just chill.

3111
03:01:19,170 --> 03:01:19,810
Just chill.

3112
03:01:21,810 --> 03:01:27,270
The thing is, I haven't played Invis in so long.

3113
03:01:27,710 --> 03:01:29,950
Because like everyone fucking plays Invis.

3114
03:01:30,090 --> 03:01:31,770
So I never have to play Invis.

3115
03:01:32,690 --> 03:01:34,610
So I don't remember how to play Invis.

3116
03:01:34,930 --> 03:01:37,930
Like, it's not that hard, but still.

3117
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:45,930
We are alive, but just us.

3118
03:01:50,910 --> 03:01:53,750
Guys, you can survive more on Luna.

3119
03:02:01,700 --> 03:02:04,110
It's a warm-up game, it's a warm-up game.

3120
03:02:04,930 --> 03:02:07,450
Guys, flaming him isn't gonna make him play better.

3121
03:02:08,530 --> 03:02:09,870
Damn, he's so PMA.

3122
03:02:13,010 --> 03:02:15,350
He's so PMA, guys.

3123
03:02:19,930 --> 03:02:20,030
Wait.

3124
03:02:20,390 --> 03:02:21,650
I gotta ult this.

3125
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:25,860
It's okay.

3126
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:27,560
It's no longer okay.

3127
03:02:30,820 --> 03:02:32,600
It's no longer okay.

3128
03:02:33,120 --> 03:02:33,520
Unless!

3129
03:02:35,240 --> 03:02:36,380
Oh my god.

3130
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:38,900
Oh my god, wait, who the fuck is?

3131
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:39,860
this guy.

3132
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:43,100
Oh my god, it's you and me.

3133
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:44,780
It's you and me.

3134
03:02:48,750 --> 03:02:50,310
It's you and me, Punisher.

3135
03:02:52,570 --> 03:02:53,270
And you too.

3136
03:02:53,630 --> 03:02:55,510
Oh my god, and you as well.

3137
03:02:59,230 --> 03:03:00,370
It's you and me.

3138
03:03:00,850 --> 03:03:02,370
Oh my god, please.

3139
03:03:03,170 --> 03:03:04,150
Oh my god.

3140
03:03:06,190 --> 03:03:07,270
I'm serious.

3141
03:03:09,690 --> 03:03:10,170
Never mind.

3142
03:03:10,310 --> 03:03:18,670
It's longer you and me i try to jump into that and it didn't

but that's okay this is a little awkward but

3144
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:42,780
it's okay we can survive this we cannot survive this

3145
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:49,760
Okay, it's okay.

3146
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:51,000
We can survive.

3147
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:53,600
Me and the thing both survived it together.

3148
03:03:56,920 --> 03:03:57,460
Oh,

3149
03:04:01,050 --> 03:04:01,050
wait.

3150
03:04:01,190 --> 03:04:01,470
It's okay.

3151
03:04:02,150 --> 03:04:02,690
We... Oh!

3152
03:04:04,250 --> 03:04:04,970
It's okay.

3153
03:04:05,130 --> 03:04:05,410
It's okay.

3154
03:04:05,710 --> 03:04:06,020
It's still...

3155
03:04:09,950 --> 03:04:12,110
Well, I hope I'm healing someone.

3156
03:04:15,710 --> 03:04:17,090
What the fuck?

3157
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:21,750
I can't see where he is.

3158
03:04:21,750 --> 03:04:22,670
GG's guys.

3159
03:04:25,170 --> 03:04:25,810
Um...

3160
03:04:28,090 --> 03:04:28,730
Um...

3161
03:04:28,730 --> 03:04:32,070
Warm up, warm up, warm up game.

3162
03:04:33,530 --> 03:04:36,190
Also, JK, I was also throwing.

3163
03:04:36,470 --> 03:04:39,490
I was playing a different version of this game, except for a
few hours.

3164
03:04:42,670 --> 03:04:43,510
That's true.

3165
03:04:43,630 --> 03:04:44,230
That's true.

3166
03:04:44,710 --> 03:04:47,370
We were playing a different game before.

3167
03:04:47,690 --> 03:04:49,410
We were... Yeah, we were...

3168
03:04:49,670 --> 03:04:54,310
We were playing, it's all the, we were just thinking about
season six.

3169
03:04:54,470 --> 03:04:55,150
That is true.

3170
03:04:55,890 --> 03:04:56,570
Oh, it's all right.

3171
03:04:56,630 --> 03:04:58,210
I didn't want to be Celestial one anyway.

3172
03:04:58,930 --> 03:04:59,410
It's okay.

3173
03:05:01,730 --> 03:05:02,470
It's okay.

3174
03:05:02,630 --> 03:05:04,990
We were, we were still in season six, right?

3175
03:05:05,310 --> 03:05:05,730
That's why.

3176
03:05:06,450 --> 03:05:08,210
We were, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3177
03:05:08,610 --> 03:05:09,050
Yeah, yeah.

3178
03:05:09,130 --> 03:05:11,130
Our heads were still thinking about season six.

3179
03:05:13,330 --> 03:05:14,410
Exactly, exactly.

3180
03:05:14,610 --> 03:05:14,810
Yeah.

3181
03:05:15,150 --> 03:05:16,410
Also, I'm banning Phoenix.

3182
03:05:16,810 --> 03:05:18,550
You're banning Phoenix.

3183
03:05:19,670 --> 03:05:20,690
Wait, why Phoenix?

3184
03:05:21,270 --> 03:05:21,690
Wait, why?

3185
03:05:22,430 --> 03:05:23,370
Characters, I don't know.

3186
03:05:23,590 --> 03:05:24,070
Characters will be.

3187
03:05:24,430 --> 03:05:24,990
I don't know.

3188
03:05:26,630 --> 03:05:27,450
I'm too old to play it.

3189
03:05:27,530 --> 03:05:27,850
I don't know.

3190
03:05:29,970 --> 03:05:32,690
Can't teach an old player new tricks, guys.

3191
03:05:33,130 --> 03:05:35,170
It's like kind of RNG if it hits or not.

3192
03:05:35,510 --> 03:05:36,130
That's true.

3193
03:05:36,530 --> 03:05:37,030
Yeah, it's true.

3194
03:05:37,370 --> 03:05:42,430
Your arrow is like 20 times a hitbox of a Phoenix hit,
right?

3195
03:05:42,450 --> 03:05:42,850
Yeah.

3196
03:05:42,850 --> 03:05:43,590
That's what I need.

3197
03:05:45,530 --> 03:05:46,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3198
03:05:47,690 --> 03:05:49,190
Alright, back to Times Square.

3199
03:05:49,330 --> 03:05:58,530
How do I get back to time square wait if i'm in time square

3200
03:05:58,530 --> 03:06:18,710

gotta position myself better there we go i got joe

3201
03:06:24,890 --> 03:06:27,130
The best day of my life.

3202
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:35,520
It's all about the positioning to make sure I have the best
angle.

3203
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:39,880
If he is talking to me, just let him know I'm having a show
right now.

3204
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:41,600
I'm going to my show.

3205
03:06:46,150 --> 03:06:46,470
It is.

3206
03:06:46,470 --> 03:06:47,670
It is the best use.

3207
03:06:49,450 --> 03:06:51,030
The best use of my emote.

3208
03:06:52,630 --> 03:06:55,570
This is my favorite part of Rivals.

3209
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:59,650
Times Square, the fact that they added Times Square.

3210
03:06:59,890 --> 03:07:01,470
Oh, I love watching my ads, too.

3211
03:07:01,950 --> 03:07:02,990
Wait, is that the future?

3212
03:07:03,290 --> 03:07:03,930
Oh, God.

3213
03:07:06,110 --> 03:07:07,150
Paul's charge.

3214
03:07:07,550 --> 03:07:08,990
Wait, you can thrust now?

3215
03:07:09,090 --> 03:07:10,590
I thought they disabled that.

3216
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:13,190
They added back in.

3217
03:07:13,350 --> 03:07:17,150
At first, when Times Square first came out, Iron Man was not
allowed to thrust.

3218
03:07:17,310 --> 03:07:19,210
They, like, wait, what's that?

3219
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:20,050
11 months?

3220
03:07:20,170 --> 03:07:22,070
Oh, it's the new Avengers movie.

3221
03:07:22,450 --> 03:07:26,010
But he was not allowed to thrust in Times Square.

3222
03:07:26,270 --> 03:07:28,170
they denied it from him

3223
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:38,780
now he's free 1984.

3224
03:07:41,160 --> 03:07:53,120

Don't you think?

3241
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:43,560
30 seconds before you attack.

3242
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:44,660
Oh, my God.

3243
03:09:45,620 --> 03:09:46,720
Oh, he's energy.

3244
03:09:47,700 --> 03:09:48,260
His number one.

3245
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:49,900
He's on the number one team currently.

3246
03:09:50,820 --> 03:09:51,680
That one MRC.

3247
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:53,460
He's on a team that one MRC.

3248
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:54,800
That's what Tony used to say.

3249
03:09:54,800 --> 03:09:55,280
Energy.

3250
03:09:56,420 --> 03:09:58,040
So they got first place.

3251
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:59,760
I am low key.

3252
03:10:01,240 --> 03:10:03,140
All right, here we go.

03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:04,380
He'll be fine.

You egoed my friend request, Brown.

03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:13,080
Damn.

3258
03:10:14,700 --> 03:10:19,760
No, I don't want to be pretty, bro.

3259
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:21,200
I just won the game.

3260
03:10:22,020 --> 03:10:23,380
I don't want your pretty.

3261
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:27,740
All right, here.

3262
03:10:31,100 --> 03:10:32,220
Oh, Spidey!

3263
03:10:34,320 --> 03:10:36,860
Ah, here we Spidey!

3264
03:10:39,180 --> 03:10:39,740
Goodbye.

3265
03:10:41,720 --> 03:10:42,280
Goodbye.

3266
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:43,800
Thank you.

3267
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:46,460
They only have one support.

3268
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:47,440
M is half and the diamond.

3269
03:10:47,600 --> 03:10:47,880
Oh!

3270
03:10:49,540 --> 03:10:53,520
They don't have enough foes.

3271
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:54,660
I'm just so you don't think.

3272
03:10:55,220 --> 03:10:57,060
Oh, someone's using the VC thing.

3273
03:10:57,800 --> 03:10:59,000
I just noticed it.

3274
03:11:02,120 --> 03:11:05,080
Okay, we got two picks here, and we're not pushing up.

3275
03:11:06,020 --> 03:11:07,060
We're so scared.

3276
03:11:12,840 --> 03:11:13,940
There we go.

3277
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:14,720
Nice.

3278
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:17,240
I'm not coming out of this hole.

3279
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:18,820
I saw Spider-Man there.

3280
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:24,320

03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:30,840

3389
03:20:17,460 --> 03:20:17,860
Spotty diff.

3390
03:20:24,160 --> 03:20:24,720
Nice.

3391
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:26,480
I hear I'll spot him, man.

3392
03:20:30,220 --> 03:20:30,920
No, it's gonna be...

3393
03:20:30,920 --> 03:20:33,820
I will not trust anybody that locks in Deadpool.

3394
03:20:34,620 --> 03:20:36,680
Like, I will not trust you.

3395
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:37,120
Oh.

3396
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:40,400
You'll have to keep fighting until we have a winner.

3397
03:20:40,540 --> 03:20:58,160
Leave them to Kanshu I'm sorry Oh shit Oh shit Hey we did it
Yeah Bullshit team We did it Let's go Come on Hi Moxie We

3398
03:20:58,160 --> 03:21:12,080
did it We beat the NA DPS champion That means we are the NA
champions Exactly We beat them so technically we are better

3399
03:21:13,500 --> 03:21:15,000
That's the rules, right?

3400
03:21:16,720 --> 03:21:18,300
That's the rules.

3401
03:21:22,730 --> 03:21:25,630
Like how we beat Saipa, we become rank number one.

3402
03:21:26,870 --> 03:21:27,430
We take it straight.

3403
03:21:27,470 --> 03:21:28,730
Yeah, we fucking...

3404
03:21:28,730 --> 03:21:31,830
If you win MRC and then like...

3405
03:21:31,830 --> 03:21:39,690
If you win MRC and then you get beat by someone in a random
rank battle, Gwanga comes over, kicks your door down, ticks

3406
03:21:39,690 --> 03:21:40,330
your trophy.

3407
03:21:41,470 --> 03:21:44,190
Because you're like, Capy rank one, if you lose the...

3408
03:21:44,430 --> 03:21:48,810
You can't be rank one if you can't win every game.

3409
03:21:49,590 --> 03:21:50,450
That's on you.

3410
03:21:52,130 --> 03:21:53,390
It makes him look bad.

3411
03:21:54,750 --> 03:21:55,650
As it should be.

3412
03:21:56,610 --> 03:21:57,970
You keep what you kill.

3413
03:22:02,850 --> 03:22:05,850
That just makes everyone look bad.

3414
03:22:07,790 --> 03:22:09,890
Yonk my trophy now.

3415
03:22:31,490 --> 03:22:34,390
Lose to a V2 for GG's.

3416
03:22:39,550 --> 03:22:42,870
Alright, back to my favorite place.

3417
03:22:43,070 --> 03:22:44,850
Oh, I like how it's automatic timescreen.

3418
03:22:45,270 --> 03:22:47,390
He knows what I want to do.

3419
03:22:49,070 --> 03:22:50,250
Oh my god.

3420
03:22:50,630 --> 03:22:53,770
And then it spawns me back to where I was before.

3421
03:22:54,470 --> 03:22:57,390
It literally keeps my location.

3422
03:22:57,930 --> 03:22:59,530
Wait, I have two?

3423
03:23:00,390 --> 03:23:02,310
Wait, there we go.

3424
03:23:04,130 --> 03:23:04,190
Keep.

3425
03:23:06,030 --> 03:23:07,550
Keep going.

3426
03:23:13,690 --> 03:23:14,650
It's okay.

3427
03:23:14,810 --> 03:23:16,070
I have this guy.

3428
03:23:17,750 --> 03:23:18,530
It's okay.

3429
03:23:18,630 --> 03:23:19,470
Let's grab a backup.

3430
03:23:20,250 --> 03:23:21,410
Always have backups.

3431
03:23:23,930 --> 03:23:25,070
Always have.

3432
03:23:25,110 --> 03:23:27,030
Always have backup, guys.

3433
03:23:29,430 --> 03:23:30,650
Wait, what's this guy's name?

3434
03:23:31,750 --> 03:23:32,810
What's his name?

3435
03:23:34,350 --> 03:23:35,710
Brack, come here.

3436
03:23:36,490 --> 03:23:37,590
I need a show.

3437
03:23:41,570 --> 03:23:42,330
Wait,

3438
03:23:46,470 --> 03:23:47,390
this guy is bigger.

3439
03:23:48,070 --> 03:23:49,270
You ain't paying.

3440
03:23:53,690 --> 03:23:55,450
He's not dancing.

3441
03:23:57,550 --> 03:23:58,890
Why is he not dancing?

3442
03:23:59,010 --> 03:23:59,790
What's the point?

3443
03:24:00,050 --> 03:24:01,090
At least I have him.

3444
03:24:02,070 --> 03:24:03,690
This is Captain America.

3445
03:24:04,350 --> 03:24:06,150
This is Captain America.

3446
03:24:08,330 --> 03:24:10,170
I like the angle for this one.

3447
03:24:13,930 --> 03:24:15,690
Let me take a sip just like Invis.

3448
03:24:20,380 --> 03:24:23,560
What's the point of being a big venom if you don't own the
twerk?

3449
03:24:23,820 --> 03:24:24,820
That's Stolen Valor.

3450
03:24:28,950 --> 03:24:31,450
That is Stolen Valor right there.

3451
03:24:36,650 --> 03:24:38,710
You might as well play something.

3452
03:24:38,830 --> 03:24:40,350
You might as well be someone else.

3453
03:24:42,350 --> 03:24:45,570
William DeFleu looking I was like

3454
03:24:48,970 --> 03:24:53,760

03:24:59,630 --> 03:25:03,300

3460
03:25:37,940 --> 03:25:39,100
What am I streaming tomorrow?

3461
03:25:40,580 --> 03:25:42,180
Guys, what's our schedule for tomorrow?

3462
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:44,180
It's Project Zomblet.

3463
03:25:44,420 --> 03:25:45,440
Oh, brainstorm ideas.

3464
03:25:45,660 --> 03:25:45,880
Okay.

3465
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:47,900
Alright, Gambit, Gambit.

3466
03:25:48,120 --> 03:25:49,140

3467
03:25:49,140 --> 03:25:49,900
Rocket.

3468
03:25:50,520 --> 03:25:52,000
Animal Crossing tab.

3469
03:25:53,340 --> 03:25:55,980
Brainstorm and then...

3470
03:25:57,500 --> 03:25:58,120
Uh...

3471
03:25:58,120 --> 03:26:00,120
The Project Zomblet.

3472
03:26:00,660 --> 03:26:01,580
Oh yeah, do I have any...

3473
03:26:02,900 --> 03:26:11,720

3474
03:26:11,720 --> 03:26:18,340
were on it so i assumed everything's fine i was about to
restart the server because of the mods the mods weren't

3475
03:26:18,340 --> 03:26:21,280

3477
03:26:36,140 --> 03:26:36,660
Is it okay?

3478
03:26:36,920 --> 03:26:38,500
Or do I need to, like, fix it?

3479
03:26:43,800 --> 03:26:44,380
Massive group.

3480
03:26:44,600 --> 03:26:45,100
You have to team up.

3481
03:26:45,740 --> 03:26:46,600
Best team up in the game.

3482
03:26:47,300 --> 03:26:48,580
This is a weird cop.

3483
03:26:49,440 --> 03:26:51,460
This is truly the last two days of rank.

3484
03:26:53,940 --> 03:26:57,320
Uh, tank, do you care if I eat your old- Oh, you can log in?

3485
03:26:57,360 --> 03:26:58,260
Okay, then it should be fine.

3486
03:26:58,380 --> 03:26:59,340
The server should be okay.

3487
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:00,200
Yeah!

3488
03:27:00,860 --> 03:27:02,520
Do you care if I eat your old face-to-portal?

3489
03:27:02,540 --> 03:27:04,600
Two, one!

3490
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:05,340
Thank you.

3491
03:27:05,820 --> 03:27:07,660
All you need to do is capture the missionary.

3492
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:14,880
it's okay they have a phoenix but it's okay i can swap off

want to play Luna into this.

3495
03:27:48,500 --> 03:27:49,500
What the fuck?

3496
03:27:50,780 --> 03:27:52,280
I mean, it's...

3497
03:27:52,280 --> 03:27:53,500
Oh, you got res, though.

3498
03:27:54,460 --> 03:27:55,160
We didn't get a kill.

3499
03:27:55,220 --> 03:27:56,880
That is a fast all of us, though.

3500
03:27:57,360 --> 03:27:57,900
For sure.

3501
03:27:58,780 --> 03:28:00,780
Alright, I think this guy is better at...

3502
03:28:00,780 --> 03:28:02,660
This guy might be better at Moon Knight than you.

3503
03:28:03,760 --> 03:28:04,640
Oh, maybe.

3504
03:28:04,900 --> 03:28:05,620
He might be...

3505
03:28:05,620 --> 03:28:06,940
He might be different.

3506
03:28:07,760 --> 03:28:08,600
Oh, goodbye.

3507
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:11,620
Goodbye.

3508
03:28:14,400 --> 03:28:14,540
Goodbye.

3509
03:28:14,920 --> 03:28:15,600
Hey, I'm MVP.

3510
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:17,080
Let's go.

3511
03:28:17,220 --> 03:28:17,860
I'm...

3512
03:28:17,860 --> 03:28:17,940
Hey, I'm MVP.

3513
03:28:17,940 --> 03:28:18,280
Don't...

3514
03:28:18,280 --> 03:28:19,460
Can we not run Rocket Joe?

3515
03:28:20,220 --> 03:28:20,600
No.

3516
03:28:21,420 --> 03:28:22,800
I have all...

3517
03:28:22,800 --> 03:28:23,020
I'll stop.

3518
03:28:23,020 --> 03:28:26,120
Can we go on the left side and try and take the not main?

3519
03:28:26,560 --> 03:28:27,160
All right.

3520
03:28:27,520 --> 03:28:29,280
There's Luna jail time.

3521
03:28:30,060 --> 03:28:31,060
There's Luna jail.

3522
03:28:33,980 --> 03:28:36,160
There's Luna jail time.

3523
03:28:40,020 --> 03:28:41,760
I don't need my...

3524
03:28:42,420 --> 03:28:42,660

03:28:49,190 --> 03:28:50,950
Yeah, no, he fucking did.

3526
03:28:54,590 --> 03:28:56,270
No, that guy is dead.

3527
03:28:58,470 --> 03:28:59,290
Yeah, I have my luck, though.

3528
03:29:00,290 --> 03:29:01,070
Really close?

3529
03:29:01,370 --> 03:29:03,330
From one mag out to the next?

3530
03:29:03,970 --> 03:29:05,230
At this point, you should go lucky.

3531
03:29:08,870 --> 03:29:10,370

We're not done yet.

3544
03:30:21,870 --> 03:30:22,650
We're not done yet.

3545
03:30:24,570 --> 03:30:25,550

03:30:27,450 --> 03:30:28,010
Not this, though.

Not this.

3551
03:30:28,430 --> 03:30:29,030
He's gonna kill me.

3552
03:30:29,210 --> 03:30:29,670
He's, oh, wait.

3553
03:30:29,710 --> 03:30:30,010

I'm fine.

3555
03:30:32,150 --> 03:30:33,050
I got that freeze.

3556
03:30:33,150 --> 03:30:33,790
That freeze was sick.

3557
03:30:34,470 --> 03:30:35,970
That was a sick-ass freeze, though.

3558
03:30:38,230 --> 03:30:39,110

3563
03:31:25,180 --> 03:31:25,760
It's okay.

3564
03:31:25,880 --> 03:31:26,240
It happens.

3565
03:31:28,860 --> 03:31:31,920
You know another DPS or another roll by any chance, Malkai?

3566
03:31:33,260 --> 03:31:33,760
It's okay.

3567
03:31:34,300 --> 03:31:34,960
No, maybe.

3568
03:31:36,660 --> 03:31:37,660
Give me a second.

3569
03:31:37,800 --> 03:31:38,080
Let me cook.

3570
03:31:39,420 --> 03:31:40,060
Yeah, he's cooking.

3571
03:31:40,200 --> 03:31:40,580
He's cooking.

3572
03:31:41,920 --> 03:31:42,880
Oh my god.

3573
03:31:42,920 --> 03:31:45,300
I looked at him when he said I need healing.

3574
03:31:45,320 --> 03:31:46,420
so that's not on me.

3575
03:31:47,160 --> 03:31:48,300
I did look at him.

3576
03:31:49,800 --> 03:31:50,320
What?

3577
03:31:51,060 --> 03:31:51,540
Okay.

3578
03:31:52,480 --> 03:31:52,820
Wait.

3579
03:31:53,740 --> 03:31:56,720
On my end, my right click went off.

3580
03:31:57,180 --> 03:31:58,940
My right click went off.

3581
03:31:59,660 --> 03:32:02,640
I would have died regardless, but my right click went off
there.

3582
03:32:03,340 --> 03:32:05,240
Yeah, and it didn't hit him.

3583
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:07,940
That should have been a hit right there.

3584
03:32:08,780 --> 03:32:13,200

I believe in you, Moxie.

3595
03:33:30,280 --> 03:33:32,720
It's okay, he asked me to believe in him.

3596
03:33:37,480 --> 03:33:38,020
Oh,

03:33:43,480 --> 03:33:45,440

3618
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:45,860
Guys, I'm telling you, believe it or not, this might be my
best DPS.

3619
03:34:48,760 --> 03:34:52,400
I know that's your best DPS, but you're kind of selling my
shit, bro.

3620
03:34:53,920 --> 03:34:56,360
No, the score line is not accurate.

3621
03:34:58,400 --> 03:35:01,280
You're gonna have to prove it.

3622
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:04,620
30 seconds before you attack.

3623
03:35:04,980 --> 03:35:05,420
Get ready.

3624
03:35:05,540 --> 03:35:08,660

3625
03:35:10,160 --> 03:35:13,160
It's his best character.

3626
03:35:13,620 --> 03:35:14,400

3627
03:35:15,020 --> 03:35:16,500
Guys, let him cook.

3628
03:35:16,680 --> 03:35:18,880
You're letting a controller player have more Elims than you.

3629
03:35:20,460 --> 03:35:21,400
Can't allow it.

03:43:56,720 --> 03:44:03,840
tweet but someone in league was reported somebody for like
picking support when they were supposed to be mid-lane and

3780
03:44:03,840 --> 03:44:09,720
then the match closed and was like due to someone disrupting
the match we closed the game before the game even started

3781
03:44:09,720 --> 03:44:15,620
because they considered them throwing because they picked
the wrong character if they had that in rivals like we would

3782
03:44:15,620 --> 03:44:29,160
never have a game a fucking game if they did that in rivals
kiyumi mid is viable yeah it feels like every who like

3783
03:44:29,160 --> 03:44:32,220

3784
03:44:49,750 --> 03:45:00,830

I should have saved it for Starlord.

3818
03:47:47,360 --> 03:47:47,800
That...

3819
03:47:47,800 --> 03:47:49,140

03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:52,480
Oh, we did not.

3822
03:47:55,460 --> 03:47:57,180
I forgot they had a Starlord.

3823
03:48:00,910 --> 03:48:02,490
That was definitely a throw for me.

3824
03:48:02,970 --> 03:48:03,750
It's okay.

3825
03:48:03,910 --> 03:48:12,890

3838
03:48:57,410 --> 03:48:58,930
Jesus Christ.

3839
03:49:03,870 --> 03:49:04,630
Okay.

3840
03:49:04,850 --> 03:49:05,650
To be fair.

3841
03:49:05,970 --> 03:49:07,560
We are not getting that.

3842
03:49:10,970 --> 03:49:11,370
Oh, no.

3843
03:49:11,530 --> 03:49:11,810

03:49:12,310 --> 03:49:12,310
No.

3845
03:49:12,850 --> 03:49:13,230
Rocket.

Okay, now save for Starlord.

3848

Now I know.

3849
03:49:22,650 --> 03:49:24,050
Okay, I saved his life.

3850
03:49:24,170 --> 03:49:24,650
You're welcome.

3851
03:49:27,710 --> 03:49:27,750
Oh.

3852
03:49:28,490 --> 03:49:32,070
That's not good when a DPS swaps to triple support.

3853
03:49:33,790 --> 03:49:35,830
That's never a good sign.

3854
03:49:39,030 --> 03:49:43,050

3868
03:51:34,010 --> 03:51:34,710
That's right.

3869
03:51:34,970 --> 03:51:39,390
If all else fails, we always have triple support.

3870
03:51:39,850 --> 03:51:40,030
Whoa.

3871
03:51:43,690 --> 03:51:47,070
If we lose triple supporters, that way.

3872
03:51:49,470 --> 03:51:50,350
Anything damage, thanks.

3873
03:51:55,690 --> 03:51:57,290

The current score is three, two, three.

Time to switch things up.

4054
04:08:27,360 --> 04:08:29,480
See, it's just about believing.

4055
04:08:31,360 --> 04:08:32,440
Jesus Christ.

4056
04:08:33,780 --> 04:08:35,860
This is a stressful fight.

4057
04:08:38,680 --> 04:08:40,680

4068
04:09:19,130 --> 04:09:21,410
Why is Maxi not on Hawkeye?

4069
04:09:21,810 --> 04:09:24,070
Because we cyber bullied him off of Hawkeye.

4070
04:09:25,890 --> 04:09:29,430

I was gonna say, I don't think it's a diff win.

4157
04:18:04,380 --> 04:18:06,180
Five people shot at it.

4159
04:18:08,420 --> 04:18:09,600

I jumped up.

4170
04:18:42,350 --> 04:18:43,670
Who fucking shot it?

4171
04:18:45,850 --> 04:18:49,810
Okay, if I do this, I need people to shoot at it.

4172
04:18:50,850 --> 04:18:52,390
Okay, someone shot the ult.

4173
04:18:53,110 --> 04:18:56,170
There was no way he's able to do that much.

4174
04:19:00,610 --> 04:19:01,010
Okay.

4175
04:19:05,590 --> 04:19:06,390
It's okay.

4176
04:19:06,910 --> 04:19:07,690
He gets res.

4177
04:19:17,670 --> 04:19:18,090
All right.

4178
04:19:19,130 --> 04:19:21,110
If I up this...

4179
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:26,620
All right, we gotta shoot the Phoenix ult.

4180
04:19:26,820 --> 04:19:27,460
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

4181
04:19:32,840 --> 04:19:35,420
We gotta shoot the Phoenix out when I do this.

4182
04:19:36,180 --> 04:19:36,660
Oh,

4183
04:19:41,250 --> 04:19:43,090
we did not shoot the Phoenix out.

4184
04:19:44,950 --> 04:19:45,330
Alright.

4185
04:19:46,410 --> 04:19:46,890
It's okay.

4186
04:19:47,030 --> 04:19:47,450
It's fine.

4187
04:19:47,690 --> 04:19:48,550
It's a good effort.

4188
04:19:49,150 --> 04:19:50,090
It was a good effort.

4189
04:19:50,390 --> 04:19:51,030
It's a good effort.

4190
04:19:51,510 --> 04:19:53,310
It was a good effort, guys.

4191
04:19:53,510 --> 04:19:54,570
It truly was.

4192
04:19:59,960 --> 04:20:00,460
It's okay.

4193
04:20:03,100 --> 04:20:05,420
That is one res to some...

4194
04:20:05,420 --> 04:20:06,080
Okay, never mind.

4195
04:20:06,840 --> 04:20:08,620
Let me get rid of...

4196
04:20:08,620 --> 04:20:12,560
I clicked E and I spammed E.

4197
04:20:16,240 --> 04:20:17,120
Ooh.

4198
04:20:17,860 --> 04:20:19,380
That is unlucky.

4199
04:20:21,020 --> 04:20:21,900

4200
04:20:25,220 --> 04:20:26,100

04:20:29,900 --> 04:20:31,860
Okay, we're up to...

4202
04:20:31,860 --> 04:20:33,260
Why are we so scared?

4203
04:20:35,400 --> 04:20:36,520
There we go.

4204
04:20:37,100 --> 04:20:38,880
I ain't no coward.

4205
04:20:39,740 --> 04:20:41,380
Yo, Invis on the far flank, right?

4206
04:20:42,560 --> 04:20:43,720
Invis on far flank, right?

4207
04:20:44,160 --> 04:20:45,420
It's gonna be flanked deep yet.

4208
04:20:47,100 --> 04:20:48,680
I ain't no coward.

4209
04:20:53,120 --> 04:20:55,500

4210
04:20:57,020 --> 04:20:58,260
Okay, there's five.

We're so healthy.

4213
04:21:02,460 --> 04:21:03,420
We're so healthy.

4214
04:21:03,580 --> 04:21:04,180
Look at us.

04:21:11,700 --> 04:21:13,720

4219
04:21:14,420 --> 04:21:15,380
Holy shit.

4220
04:21:15,520 --> 04:21:17,000
Okay, that Invis is throwing.

4221
04:21:17,680 --> 04:21:18,100

4223
04:21:25,300 --> 04:21:27,920
Alright, Invis is still behind us.

04:21:29,100 --> 04:21:30,920
He's still there.

4225
04:21:31,460 --> 04:21:33,260

Okay, not yet.

04:28:03,780 --> 04:28:04,040
Not yet.

4301
04:28:04,100 --> 04:28:04,620
Don't watch it.

4302
04:28:04,740 --> 04:28:05,160
Don't watch it.

4303
04:28:05,340 --> 04:28:06,580
CC, look, we're winning.

4304
04:28:07,100 --> 04:28:08,760
That's what I wanted you guys to watch.

4305
04:28:09,020 --> 04:28:09,540
My team.

4306
04:28:09,900 --> 04:28:12,140
Because this is a team game.

4307
04:28:14,380 --> 04:28:16,060
Did you watch it?

4308
04:28:17,500 --> 04:28:19,180
Did you watch the team?

4309
04:28:20,660 --> 04:28:25,440
Okay, she's the infant is back here.

4310
04:28:25,660 --> 04:28:26,700
Oh wait, no, it's the Adam.

4311
04:28:28,220 --> 04:28:29,740
That's not a woman.

4312
04:28:33,280 --> 04:28:35,180
Wait a minute.

4313
04:28:37,940 --> 04:28:39,900
Wait a minute.

4314
04:28:40,480 --> 04:28:42,100
That wasn't a woman.

4315
04:28:44,120 --> 04:28:47,580

It was after me, bro.

4320
04:29:31,100 --> 04:29:33,980
Like, goodbye.

4321
04:29:34,660 --> 04:29:35,400

All right, there we go.

04:29:51,680 --> 04:29:52,180
The juice.

4333
04:29:52,300 --> 04:29:54,180
I told you I got this.

4334
04:29:56,020 --> 04:29:58,700
But they hate you.

4335
04:30:00,280 --> 04:30:01,480
There you go.

4336
04:30:02,260 --> 04:30:03,160
It's that easy.

4337
04:30:05,820 --> 04:30:08,120
They want me so bad.

4338
04:30:12,480 --> 04:30:12,940
Oh.

4339
04:30:13,860 --> 04:30:15,680
That was scary for her.

4340
04:30:16,880 --> 04:30:18,000
Yeah, they want me.

4341
04:30:20,900 --> 04:30:22,280
Don't worry, I'll stay up here.

4342
04:30:22,300 --> 04:30:37,400

Oh!

4346
04:30:55,140 --> 04:30:55,700
It's okay.

4347
04:30:56,140 --> 04:30:57,080
Okay, it's him.

4348
04:30:58,020 --> 04:30:59,500
It's a zoning out.

4349
04:30:59,620 --> 04:31:00,680
It's a zoning out.

4350
04:31:01,260 --> 04:31:02,300
Yeah.

4351
04:31:03,040 --> 04:31:03,920
They got one.

4352
04:31:03,920 --> 04:31:04,360
They got scared.

4353
04:31:05,160 --> 04:31:05,500
Yeah.

4354
04:31:07,220 --> 04:31:09,460
What just happened?

4355
04:31:10,820 --> 04:31:11,860
Um...

4356
04:31:11,860 --> 04:31:13,320
What just happened?

4357
04:31:13,680 --> 04:31:13,820
Um...

4358
04:31:13,820 --> 04:31:15,920
It is avoiding time.

4359
04:31:18,020 --> 04:31:20,300
Team flaming me.

4360
04:31:20,860 --> 04:31:21,440
Okay.

4361
04:31:24,100 --> 04:31:25,800
Don't worry, I got it.

4362
04:31:27,520 --> 04:31:30,440
Alright, don't avoid me.

4363
04:31:34,580 --> 04:31:36,600
Yeah, I gotta avoid the flanking.

4364
04:31:37,920 --> 04:31:40,280
Yeah, and then they both started flanking too.

4365
04:31:40,480 --> 04:31:42,440
And then that's where it got a little crazy.

4366
04:31:46,700 --> 04:31:50,600
Yeah, welcome to end of season games.

4367
04:31:51,840 --> 04:31:53,720
You never get off this wild ride.

4368
04:31:54,580 --> 04:31:57,280
Bro, that guy is 8-16?

4369
04:31:58,120 --> 04:32:00,280
Bro, that wasn't even the Invis.

4370
04:32:01,400 --> 04:32:03,360
Oh, that was the Squirrel Girl.

4371
04:32:03,860 --> 04:32:04,240
Emma.

4372
04:32:04,740 --> 04:32:05,860
Oh, shit, bro.

4373
04:32:05,880 --> 04:32:09,600
That guy died 16 times on Emma and Squirrel Girl.

4374
04:32:10,120 --> 04:32:12,000
Okay, that's a little embarrassing.

4375
04:32:14,160 --> 04:32:14,640
Yeah.

4376
04:32:14,800 --> 04:32:18,300
Bro, that guy, all he did was flank and he only got 10k
damage.

4377
04:32:19,000 --> 04:32:22,740
He does have 8 final hits, which is the same as the other
DPS, though.

4378
04:32:22,780 --> 04:32:23,860
I will have to admit.

4379
04:32:24,140 --> 04:32:26,940
He did get eight final hits.

4380
04:32:29,540 --> 04:32:30,020
Yeah.

4381
04:32:31,560 --> 04:32:34,320
No, he soloed his own games.

4382
04:32:36,440 --> 04:32:37,360
How when it does...

4383
04:32:37,360 --> 04:32:38,660
Oh my god, it ends in one...

4384
04:32:38,660 --> 04:32:39,260
No, that...

4385
04:32:39,260 --> 04:32:40,020
Yeah, that seems right.

4386
04:32:40,100 --> 04:32:42,100
This does seem like end of season lobby.

4387
04:32:42,680 --> 04:32:43,140
It's...

4388
04:32:45,100 --> 04:32:45,820
Yeah, no.

4389
04:32:45,920 --> 04:32:47,520
These are end of season games.

4390
04:32:48,960 --> 04:32:49,440
100%.

4391
04:32:55,010 --> 04:32:56,070
That one Asian.

4392
04:32:56,070 --> 04:32:57,230
They give the Twitch Prime.

4393
04:32:57,290 --> 04:32:58,290
Thank you, thank you.

4394
04:32:58,550 --> 04:33:00,290
They give the tier one sub.

4395
04:33:00,390 --> 04:33:01,470
Thank you, thank you.

4396
04:33:02,310 --> 04:33:03,450
What's the special shiny?

4397
04:33:03,510 --> 04:33:04,970
Oh, yeah, I forgot to check.

4398
04:33:05,150 --> 04:33:05,830
What is it?

4399
04:33:06,110 --> 04:33:06,810
Is it customized?

4400
04:33:07,470 --> 04:33:09,230
I haven't tried for it in so long.

4401
04:33:10,150 --> 04:33:11,330
Oh, it's a chess icon.

4402
04:33:11,670 --> 04:33:12,810
Oh, I didn't see next season.

4403
04:33:12,830 --> 04:33:13,510
I mean, I could die.

4404
04:33:13,970 --> 04:33:15,850
I'll just, someone else will post about it.

4405
04:33:16,470 --> 04:33:17,310
It's a chess piece.

4406
04:33:17,430 --> 04:33:19,390
The dragon is the coolest one, though.

4407
04:33:20,550 --> 04:33:24,230
Guys, what is the, what's the special shiny icon for next
season, guys?

4408
04:33:28,590 --> 04:33:29,470
What is it?

4409
04:33:32,450 --> 04:33:33,770
Because I didn't look at it.

4410
04:33:34,930 --> 04:33:35,990
I just looked at the funny.

4411
04:33:36,210 --> 04:33:39,830
I just looked at the funny stuff when I did the early Axis.

4412
04:33:40,890 --> 04:33:42,710
And the triple Deadpool bad.

4413
04:33:43,610 --> 04:33:44,810
I feel like.

4414
04:33:44,910 --> 04:33:46,270
I do feel like.

4415
04:33:47,290 --> 04:33:48,490
I think Deadpool.

4416
04:33:50,730 --> 04:33:52,730
Is not going to get bad.

4417
04:33:53,030 --> 04:33:54,490
Because he's so complicated.

4418
04:33:54,990 --> 04:33:57,250
I think like after people figure him out.

4419
04:33:57,390 --> 04:33:58,510
Everyone's going to ban him.

4420
04:33:58,590 --> 04:34:04,270
like Wolverine because like at first everyone was like oh
Wolverine is such a fucking throw pick and it because no one

4421
04:34:04,270 --> 04:34:10,750
knew how to no one knew how to play Wolverine back then and
then when people figured out Wolverine he became like like

4422
04:34:10,750 --> 04:34:18,410
they didn't do anything them um they didn't do like any
actual like nerfs or buffs to him people just were like oh

4423
04:34:18,410 --> 04:34:25,570
shit that's how you play Wolverine and then like and then
everyone just banned him I think the moment people figure it

4424
04:34:25,570 --> 04:34:30,430
out DPS and tank, I don't think he's a support.

4425
04:34:31,530 --> 04:34:33,570
I don't think support is gonna get bad.

4426
04:34:34,310 --> 04:34:35,310
Is eternity lobbies?

4427
04:34:35,950 --> 04:34:37,590
Oh, shit, we're in the big boy club.

4428
04:34:38,390 --> 04:34:40,830
Four feet nine, 450 pounds.

4429
04:34:41,150 --> 04:34:42,850
Yep, that's an eternity lobby.

4430
04:34:52,040 --> 04:34:54,380
I think Rivalis has the best names.

4431
04:34:57,980 --> 04:34:59,880
People are so creative with rival names.

4432
04:35:02,400 --> 04:35:05,300
Oh, hey, thank you for gifting us up to Dorky Bird.

4433
04:35:05,480 --> 04:35:06,400
Thank you, thank you.

4434
04:35:12,320 --> 04:35:13,860
Do we have a Loki player?

4435
04:35:14,100 --> 04:35:15,260
I mean, besides, actually, we have a Gambit player.

4436
04:35:15,380 --> 04:35:15,800
I play Loki.

4437
04:35:17,340 --> 04:35:18,280
Oh, fuck me, then.

4438
04:35:18,360 --> 04:35:18,900
Alright, we can go.

4439
04:35:20,180 --> 04:35:21,320
Yeah, we have a Gambit player.

4440
04:35:21,480 --> 04:35:21,760
I play this.

4441
04:35:21,920 --> 04:35:22,840
You are the...

4442
04:35:22,840 --> 04:35:23,680
What the fuck?

4443
04:35:31,330 --> 04:35:32,130
Bro, he's...

4444
04:35:32,750 --> 04:35:33,150
He's...

4445
04:35:33,150 --> 04:35:33,970
Okay, that's funny.

4446
04:35:34,050 --> 04:35:35,730
He's like, oh, wait, I'm the Gambit player.

4447
04:35:36,230 --> 04:35:38,370
Oh, we guess we don't have Gambit or Loki.

4448
04:35:39,750 --> 04:35:41,890
You know what that means.

4449
04:35:43,610 --> 04:35:44,930
God damn it.

4450
04:35:49,110 --> 04:35:49,550
Never mind.

4451
04:35:49,790 --> 04:35:51,670
I was like, you know what that?

4452
04:35:51,890 --> 04:35:52,370
Oh, okay.

4453
04:35:53,490 --> 04:35:54,170
It's Luna.

4454
04:35:57,630 --> 04:35:59,790
I didn't think he'll pick Rocket.

4455
04:36:00,410 --> 04:36:01,650
Bro, he plays Gambit.

4456
04:36:01,810 --> 04:36:04,110
You assume he would play fucking Luna.

4457
04:36:07,150 --> 04:36:08,410
Luna, time.

4458
04:36:11,110 --> 04:36:16,730

Yeah, I don't have to aim.

04:36:56,500 --> 04:36:58,180
Where the fuck is my daredevil?

There we go.

Wait, is he dead?

4467
04:37:05,280 --> 04:37:07,720
He does not need to know that I missed my two shots.

4468
04:37:08,600 --> 04:37:09,780
I have an excuse.

4469
04:37:10,680 --> 04:37:12,160
I haven't played this in a while.

4470
04:37:14,520 --> 04:37:15,480
Oh my god.

4471
04:37:16,060 --> 04:37:16,920

4478
04:38:24,050 --> 04:38:26,350
I can't out heal all of that, though.

4479
04:38:28,710 --> 04:38:29,230
Unfortunately.

4480
04:38:29,990 --> 04:38:31,410
That was a lot.

4481
04:38:34,530 --> 04:38:37,350
How are they Burma healing front line?

4482
04:38:38,830 --> 04:38:40,550
That's a good question.

4483
04:38:40,870 --> 04:38:41,430
Marking there.

4484
04:38:41,630 --> 04:38:42,430
Flank, Jeff.

4485
04:38:42,810 --> 04:38:45,010
I'm going to try not to mark him this time, though.

4486
04:38:45,290 --> 04:38:46,150
You guys can deal with that.

4487
04:38:46,190 --> 04:38:47,550
I'll try to dive the backline more.

4488
04:38:48,790 --> 04:38:49,810
That is true.

4489
04:38:51,230 --> 04:38:54,070
Like there is a backline jet for some...

4490
04:38:54,730 --> 04:38:55,970
Oh, where is he?

4491
04:38:56,890 --> 04:38:57,830
Oh my god.

4492
04:38:58,330 --> 04:38:58,730
You

4493
04:39:10,080 --> 04:39:11,900

4494
04:39:14,140 --> 04:39:15,420
I fucking...

4495
04:39:15,420 --> 04:39:17,320
Oh my god.

4496
04:39:17,860 --> 04:39:21,060
He... I saved my rocket just to get eaten.

4497
04:39:22,720 --> 04:39:24,240
Oh my god.

4498
04:39:24,540 --> 04:39:26,120
Just to get eaten by him.

4499
04:39:28,240 --> 04:39:31,000
I saved his life and it was not worth it.

4500
04:39:31,420 --> 04:39:43,140
hold high at least I have the song to vibe to it definitely
is like a nerf it

4501
04:39:47,660 --> 04:40:04,340

04:40:04,340 --> 04:40:06,780

4503
04:40:06,780 --> 04:40:10,160
I was mispositioned like crazy.

4504
04:40:13,780 --> 04:40:17,060
I had to ult that because I was not positioned, right?

4505
04:40:17,880 --> 04:40:19,020
It was my...

4506
04:40:19,020 --> 04:40:22,060
It was my get out of jail free card.

4507
04:40:24,640 --> 04:40:25,840
He's coming.

4508
04:40:27,020 --> 04:40:28,540
The chef is coming.

4509
04:40:29,040 --> 04:40:29,760
That's crazy.

4510
04:40:41,820 --> 04:40:42,860
Oh my god.

4511
04:40:45,880 --> 04:40:46,240
Oh.

4512
04:40:53,690 --> 04:40:54,350
That'll be more.

4513
04:40:56,310 --> 04:40:57,030
Oh, my God.

4514
04:40:57,170 --> 04:40:59,110
He's like, oh, I'm fucking, I'm gonna die.

4515
04:40:59,210 --> 04:41:00,110
And then he just subs as Joe.

4516
04:41:00,730 --> 04:41:01,250
I hate that.

4517
04:41:01,290 --> 04:41:03,070
I hate, like, I wish, like, the...

4518
04:41:03,070 --> 04:41:04,830
I need healing for supports.

4519
04:41:04,910 --> 04:41:08,150
Like, the warning thing is not, like, for one damage.

4520
04:41:09,810 --> 04:41:10,390
I'm gonna let...

4521
04:41:10,390 --> 04:41:12,170
Oh, I was gonna say I'm gonna let him heal more.

4522
04:41:12,910 --> 04:41:14,010
But I'm also worried.

4523
04:41:14,930 --> 04:41:16,530
Because we do need the other element more.

4524
04:41:17,050 --> 04:41:18,490
I'm gonna try and DP this thing.

4525
04:41:18,950 --> 04:41:19,610
Oh, I got it.

4526
04:41:20,210 --> 04:41:21,770
You guys will hope.

4527
04:41:24,990 --> 04:41:27,810
Oh my god, I almost killed him.

4528
04:41:28,790 --> 04:41:40,070
The Jeff literally, oh Okay Don't mess with the amazing
spider-man

4529
04:41:43,390 --> 04:41:45,470
I saved your life

4530
04:41:50,480 --> 04:41:51,900
I saved your life

4531
04:41:56,600 --> 04:42:02,660
Oh, that is very unfortunate.

4532
04:42:13,140 --> 04:42:13,820
Oh, we're fighting.

4533
04:42:13,980 --> 04:42:14,300
We're fighting.

4534
04:42:14,720 --> 04:42:15,300
Okay, okay, okay.

4535
04:42:15,600 --> 04:42:15,920
I'm coming back.

4536
04:42:16,000 --> 04:42:16,580
I'm coming back.

4537
04:42:18,440 --> 04:42:18,800
Oh, whoa.

4538
04:42:19,620 --> 04:42:21,120
Okay, I...

4539
04:42:22,240 --> 04:42:22,840
Okay.

4540
04:42:23,380 --> 04:42:24,540
I want it.

4541
04:42:25,340 --> 04:42:25,680
Whoa.

4542
04:42:27,360 --> 04:42:28,500
There was nothing I could do.

4543
04:42:29,400 --> 04:42:31,820
I was trying to save our daredevil.

4544
04:42:33,480 --> 04:42:34,760
I was so confused.

4545
04:42:34,880 --> 04:42:36,620
I thought he was going to come over.

4546
04:42:37,700 --> 04:42:39,540
I'm so fucking confused.

4547
04:42:39,860 --> 04:42:41,360
That was a very confusing fight.

4548
04:42:42,700 --> 04:42:43,320
I was like, don't worry.

4549
04:42:43,560 --> 04:42:44,900
I'll come save you if you're going to.

4550
04:42:46,660 --> 04:42:47,560
I can go blind.

4551
04:42:47,660 --> 04:42:48,080
Nobody's there.

4552
04:42:48,120 --> 04:42:50,440
I will say that was a very confusing fight.

4553
04:42:50,920 --> 04:42:57,460
Because I assumed that he was going to push up and then he
disappeared.

4554
04:43:07,070 --> 04:43:10,170
He was, he literally disappeared in front of my eyes.

4555
04:43:17,370 --> 04:43:21,330
I will say that was a very shitty Luna up, but they don't
have to know that.

4556
04:43:38,220 --> 04:43:38,480
Please.

4557
04:43:41,180 --> 04:43:42,040
There's no way.

4558
04:43:42,280 --> 04:43:43,520
It's me and the other support.

4559
04:43:43,680 --> 04:43:44,140
Let's go.

4560
04:43:44,520 --> 04:43:46,420
Me and the other support balloting it up.

4561
04:43:50,860 --> 04:43:51,140
Okay.

4562
04:43:51,300 --> 04:43:54,060
Switch things up, including which side you're on.

4563
04:43:56,080 --> 04:43:58,240
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

4564
04:43:58,260 --> 04:44:00,260
Guys, I'm going- I'm getting right back into it.

4565
04:44:01,160 --> 04:44:05,760
Look, it might look very ugly in the beginning, but...

4566
04:44:06,400 --> 04:44:07,960
Also, the alt was pretty ugly.

4567
04:44:08,300 --> 04:44:11,420
But like, I'm getting back into the groove, okay?

4568
04:44:11,600 --> 04:44:14,100
Like, I'm slowly getting back into it.

4569
04:44:17,580 --> 04:44:18,520
It's okay.

4570
04:44:19,000 --> 04:44:20,640
The alt needs a little work.

4571
04:44:20,860 --> 04:44:22,940
But everything else, it's fine.

4572
04:44:35,180 --> 04:44:35,660
Okay.

4573
04:44:36,080 --> 04:44:36,600
It's fine.

4574
04:44:38,860 --> 04:44:41,380
Yeah, winning isn't always pretty, guys.

4575
04:44:42,640 --> 04:44:43,600
We gotta...

4576
04:44:43,600 --> 04:44:44,900
It's all about...

4577
04:44:44,900 --> 04:44:47,420
We gotta make it, like, you know, more exciting.

4578
04:44:47,540 --> 04:44:51,560
Because if you play perfectly, then it won't be as exciting
to watch, guys.

4579
04:44:52,040 --> 04:44:55,000
Not like people watch, like, the best players in the world
or anything.

4580
04:44:57,700 --> 04:45:03,380
people like watching like people who are good at the game
they just they like people they like to watch people who are

4581
04:45:03,380 --> 04:45:20,100
adequate you know you know i'm like i'm like the tim tim
tatman of vtubers i'm the tim the tatman of vtubers guys

4582
04:45:22,980 --> 04:45:26,420

4583
04:45:31,400 --> 04:45:40,480

4584
04:45:40,480 --> 04:45:53,480
going in backwards three two one okay whoa yep he dropped
okay he definitely was in the backline oh my god he

4585
04:45:53,480 --> 04:46:01,080
definitely was in the backline though you said he was gonna
go That was crazy.

4586
04:46:01,240 --> 04:46:02,880
That was a crazy hook.

4587
04:46:13,290 --> 04:46:15,410
I think we need our triple DPS.

4588
04:46:15,590 --> 04:46:17,090
I don't know why we went triple support.

4589
04:46:18,090 --> 04:46:20,110
Like, their triple support was not working.

4590
04:46:21,850 --> 04:46:23,850
Oh, I guess for the Spider-Man?

4591
04:46:25,190 --> 04:46:26,390
Oh, no.

4592
04:46:26,650 --> 04:46:28,230
Oh, no.

4593
04:46:32,380 --> 04:46:33,580
That's awkward.

4594
04:46:34,900 --> 04:46:35,840
It's okay.

4595
04:46:38,520 --> 04:46:50,700
support us we like guys it's okay we triple killed them
that's the strat I do not have all yet which is bad

4596
04:47:02,220 --> 04:47:09,300
there you go I'm alive all right someone's gonna get eaten
and he's not gonna be me

4597
04:47:12,740 --> 04:47:31,160
Oh, there's the second up There it is That spider-man is up

stream way too much So I'm used to looking at like 200

4601
04:48:04,450 --> 04:48:13,370

it's like I'm like

4602
04:48:17,910 --> 04:48:20,030
So it's like bothering me.

4603
04:48:22,650 --> 04:48:24,150
Oh, I thought he was going to go left.

4604
04:48:25,210 --> 04:48:26,010
I miscounted.

4605
04:48:26,170 --> 04:48:27,430
Or I misjudged.

4606
04:48:29,950 --> 04:48:31,150
Wait, that guy's low.

4607
04:48:31,930 --> 04:48:33,050
Oh, that guy's dead.

4608
04:48:34,710 --> 04:48:34,790
Oh.

4609
04:48:39,620 --> 04:48:40,540
Where is he?

4610
04:48:41,200 --> 04:48:42,560
He has no light up.

4611
04:48:42,660 --> 04:48:43,780
That guy's going to jump in.

4612
04:48:43,920 --> 04:48:44,540
Oh, shit.

4613
04:48:44,780 --> 04:48:45,680

Oh, fuck it.

4617
04:48:54,320 --> 04:48:55,480
Oh, it's okay.

4618
04:48:58,120 --> 04:48:59,280
There's a hot guy in the pool tonight.

4619
04:48:59,740 --> 04:48:59,900
I know.

4620
04:49:00,160 --> 04:49:00,380

04:49:01,500 --> 04:49:02,420
Hey, guys.

4622

Oh, nice.

4624
04:49:04,280 --> 04:49:05,260
They see nine.

4625
04:49:07,900 --> 04:49:09,040
Run and double.

4626
04:49:09,880 --> 04:49:13,400
It's even funnier the second time when we double support.

4627
04:49:13,840 --> 04:49:14,160
I bet.

4628
04:49:15,000 --> 04:49:16,280
Guys, it's just...

4629
04:49:16,280 --> 04:49:17,000
It's even funnier.

4630
04:49:17,020 --> 04:49:29,350
here there we go it was planned exactly it's just even
funnier when it happens again

4631
04:49:33,460 --> 04:49:44,360
easy yeah double support alt versus c9 will win plus 17 i
thought this was an eternity lobby Was it not?

4632
04:49:48,130 --> 04:49:49,350
Come on, I didn't do too bad.

4633
04:49:53,310 --> 04:49:54,190
Alright, I gotta check.

4634
04:49:56,890 --> 04:49:59,050
And then it goes downhill here.

4635
04:50:01,570 --> 04:50:03,610
I didn't see the average.

4636
04:50:05,690 --> 04:50:06,830
Yeah, what the fuck?

4637
04:50:07,490 --> 04:50:09,570
How do I get a fucking plus 17?

4638
04:50:10,470 --> 04:50:12,150
I didn't do too bad there.

4639
04:50:12,570 --> 04:50:14,510
I had some sick ass freezes.

4640
04:50:16,070 --> 04:50:16,750
Come on.

4641
04:50:16,910 --> 04:50:19,230
Those freezes were fucking sick.

4642
04:50:20,330 --> 04:50:21,090
I didn't even miss it.

4643
04:50:21,150 --> 04:50:21,330
Okay.

4644
04:50:22,490 --> 04:50:22,830
All right.

4645
04:50:23,530 --> 04:50:24,990
I'm not jinxing it.

4646
04:50:25,030 --> 04:50:27,090
I said it all goes downhill here.

4647
04:50:27,490 --> 04:50:27,830
Guys.

4648
04:50:28,150 --> 04:50:28,450
You know what?

4649
04:50:28,530 --> 04:50:29,450
I should be able to grab water.

4650
04:50:29,570 --> 04:50:30,050
I'll be right back.

4651
04:50:30,150 --> 04:50:30,570
Don't worry.

4652
04:50:31,130 --> 04:50:31,750
I need more water.

4653
04:50:31,890 --> 04:50:33,130
I finished my water.

4654
04:52:16,610 --> 04:52:18,810
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

4655
04:52:32,480 --> 04:52:35,040
Now, who is going to vanish from this match?

4656
04:52:35,320 --> 04:52:36,040
Let me do that real.

4657
04:52:36,160 --> 04:52:36,900
I did it.

4658
04:52:42,150 --> 04:52:48,930
all right we have good timing we're just doing our bad
phases you don't have a support player except for me but

4659
04:52:48,930 --> 04:52:49,810
that's okay

4660
04:52:53,190 --> 04:52:58,350
that's all right we're

4661
04:53:02,410 --> 04:53:21,650
gaming as long as we're gaming guys everything is fine it's
true it's not about winning it's about the memories we we

4662
04:53:21,650 --> 04:53:23,430
make That is true.

4663
04:53:24,690 --> 04:53:26,450
Hashtag goals.

4664
04:53:31,900 --> 04:53:34,180
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

4665
04:53:37,640 --> 04:53:38,540
But I'm bum bum.

4666
04:53:52,870 --> 04:53:53,170
Alright.

4667
04:53:54,610 --> 04:53:56,330
I shall play.

4668
04:53:57,650 --> 04:53:59,090
I deserve to play Rocket.

4669
04:54:00,950 --> 04:54:06,530
I after in between Luna games I get to play Rocket.

4670
04:54:06,810 --> 04:54:09,210
If I get, if I have to play Luna I get to play Rocket.

4671
04:54:09,230 --> 04:54:16,290
it but sometimes we take stuff other people are garbage
unicorn they give a little twitch prime thank you thank you

4672
04:54:16,290 --> 04:54:32,770

4674
04:54:40,950 --> 04:54:41,490
He is.

4675
04:54:41,830 --> 04:54:43,290
Because we banned everything.

4676
04:54:44,490 --> 04:54:46,630
Technically it is because everything got bad.

4677
04:54:52,130 --> 04:54:53,510
I get to chill.

4678
04:54:56,750 --> 04:54:57,570
Oh, there's Hulk.

4679
04:54:58,590 --> 04:55:00,030
Here he comes.

4680
04:55:00,370 --> 04:55:01,390
Oh, there's Thor.

4681
04:55:03,410 --> 04:55:04,590
They won't know I'm here.

4682
04:55:05,710 --> 04:55:07,050
How would he know?

4683
04:55:07,370 --> 04:55:08,450
I'm in the smoke.

4684
04:55:09,230 --> 04:55:10,730
They're walling if he knows.

4685
04:55:11,030 --> 04:55:12,390
Oh my god.

4686
04:55:13,390 --> 04:55:14,450
It'll be fine, right?

4687
04:55:14,890 --> 04:55:17,030
He was not fine.

4688
04:55:17,870 --> 04:55:18,410
And it's okay.

4689
04:55:18,570 --> 04:55:19,370
He gets west.

4690
04:55:19,910 --> 04:55:20,450
Or bad.

4691
04:55:24,740 --> 04:55:25,280
Look, see?

4692
04:55:25,560 --> 04:55:26,840
He still don't know.

4693
04:55:28,460 --> 04:55:28,980
Look at that.

4694
04:55:29,200 --> 04:55:30,620
They're like, where is this?

4695
04:55:31,780 --> 04:55:32,840
Oh my god.

4696
04:55:33,300 --> 04:55:34,300
Oh my god.

4697
04:55:34,700 --> 04:55:36,040
Oh my god.

4698
04:55:36,280 --> 04:55:37,060
I'm climbing.

4699
04:55:37,200 --> 04:55:38,020
You're on your own.

4700
04:55:39,340 --> 04:55:40,900
You're on your own.

4701
04:55:42,640 --> 04:55:44,240
If the wolf's on me, burn him.

4702
04:55:44,300 --> 04:55:45,540
He was like, he should run in.

4703
04:55:45,760 --> 04:55:47,220
I was like, no, bro.

4704
04:55:47,500 --> 04:55:48,920
I'm staying here.

4705
04:55:50,720 --> 04:55:52,360
I'm staying down there.

4706
04:55:53,120 --> 04:55:53,900
Oh, this sucks.

4707
04:55:54,060 --> 04:55:54,720
We don't have...

4708
04:55:54,720 --> 04:55:54,980
Oh, wait.

4709
04:55:54,980 --> 04:55:56,200
I could technically play cloak.

4710
04:55:56,960 --> 04:55:59,180
Because, um, you don't have mag.

4711
04:56:00,000 --> 04:56:01,120
But why play...

4712
04:56:01,120 --> 04:56:01,800
Oh, yeah.

4713
04:56:01,860 --> 04:56:03,920
I should play cloak because they have Phoenix now.

4714
04:56:04,500 --> 04:56:05,400
There's no...

4715
04:56:05,400 --> 04:56:05,740
You know what?

4716
04:56:05,740 --> 04:56:06,820
They're not going to see this.

4717
04:56:08,080 --> 04:56:09,460
Oh, he got stunned.

4718
04:56:09,980 --> 04:56:10,420
Nope.

4719
04:56:11,480 --> 04:56:13,500
A little overkill, but that's cool.

4720
04:56:16,520 --> 04:56:18,980
Wait, I'll grab this so they don't see...

4721
04:56:21,080 --> 04:56:21,560
Yeah!

4722
04:56:26,040 --> 04:56:26,880
I'll let...

4723
04:56:26,880 --> 04:56:28,180
I'll let her out first.

4724
04:56:30,700 --> 04:56:31,100
Alright.

4725
04:56:33,620 --> 04:56:35,560
There's no way they know it's here.

4726
04:56:35,680 --> 04:56:36,900
They might see the floating armor.

4727
04:56:38,420 --> 04:56:38,980
Wait.

4728
04:56:39,260 --> 04:56:40,080
You can out first.

4729
04:56:41,580 --> 04:56:42,980
I'm about to hit my wall.

4730
04:56:44,700 --> 04:56:45,240
Oh.

4731
04:56:46,400 --> 04:56:47,180
Everything is fine.

4732
04:56:48,640 --> 04:56:49,960
You'll be fine, right?

4733
04:56:50,120 --> 04:56:50,320
Okay.

4734
04:56:50,820 --> 04:56:51,860
Yeah, I was gonna say!

4735
04:56:52,400 --> 04:56:53,940
You'll be fine, right?

4736
04:56:55,620 --> 04:56:57,200
It's fine over there.

4737
04:56:57,500 --> 04:56:58,720
Oh, I fucked up the wall.

4738
04:56:59,000 --> 04:56:59,600
I wasn't gonna do that.

4739
04:57:01,000 --> 04:57:02,780
Oh my god.

4740
04:57:03,040 --> 04:57:04,420
I mean, I'm fine with that.

4741
04:57:09,960 --> 04:57:10,520

I'm sorry.

4749
04:57:35,520 --> 04:57:39,560

Least amount of effort to gain the Eno.

4753
04:58:16,860 --> 04:58:18,840
A win's a win.

4754
04:58:19,580 --> 04:58:19,580
Exactly.

4755
04:58:22,160 --> 04:58:23,540
It's all about the min-max.

4756
04:58:25,480 --> 04:58:26,240
Watch this.

4757
04:58:26,420 --> 04:58:28,240
I'm here.

4758
04:58:30,960 --> 04:58:31,780

A win's a win.

4762
04:58:39,640 --> 04:58:42,580
We're not here to make it harder for ourselves.

4763
04:58:46,140 --> 04:58:50,560
It's all about what is the easiest way to grab snatch
victory.

4764
04:58:55,240 --> 04:58:56,800
Don't save that.

4765
04:58:59,420 --> 04:59:01,520
I personally think...

4766
04:59:02,260 --> 04:59:03,620
I personally think...

4767
04:59:05,200 --> 04:59:06,580
GM is low.

4768
04:59:07,520 --> 04:59:10,520
If you're especially like this late, but also...

4769
04:59:11,080 --> 04:59:13,140
But also, we are not the same.

4770
04:59:15,240 --> 04:59:17,020
I'll be brutally honest.

4771
04:59:20,940 --> 04:59:21,660
Whoa!

4772
04:59:22,800 --> 04:59:23,520
Damn!

4773
04:59:24,920 --> 04:59:27,020
I won't lie to you!

4774
04:59:27,480 --> 04:59:27,960
I...

4775
04:59:29,840 --> 04:59:32,360
I'm not here to sugarcoat it.

4776
04:59:32,660 --> 04:59:34,840
This is motivation for you.

4777
04:59:35,560 --> 04:59:36,800
All right, damn.

4778
04:59:37,520 --> 04:59:38,820
Yeah, we have...

4779
04:59:38,820 --> 04:59:39,900
Yeah, I don't have a life.

4780
04:59:39,980 --> 04:59:42,740
Look, look, I'm not saying that as if...

4781
04:59:42,740 --> 04:59:44,840
No, I don't have a life, guys.

4782
04:59:45,140 --> 04:59:45,520
I don't...

4783
04:59:45,520 --> 04:59:46,900
You guys...

4784
04:59:46,900 --> 04:59:49,440
You guys have more of a life than me.

4785
04:59:50,760 --> 04:59:53,140
When I'm sad, I play Marvel Rivals.

4786
04:59:53,680 --> 04:59:56,360
When I'm happy, I play Marvel Rivals.

4787
04:59:56,980 --> 04:59:58,400
When I'm here...

4788
04:59:58,400 --> 04:59:59,720
I'm disassociating.

4789
05:00:00,020 --> 05:00:01,640
I play Marvel Rivals.

4790
05:00:01,920 --> 05:00:03,200
We are not the same.

4791
05:00:04,760 --> 05:00:05,800
That's sad.

4792
05:00:08,240 --> 05:00:09,800
It's not...

4793
05:00:12,780 --> 05:00:13,560
Exactly.

4794
05:00:15,560 --> 05:00:16,860
That doesn't sound like a...

4795
05:00:16,860 --> 05:00:17,580
Exactly.

4796
05:00:17,800 --> 05:00:19,820
You don't want to be like me.

4797
05:00:20,360 --> 05:00:23,580
You don't want to be like me.

4798
05:00:24,240 --> 05:00:26,520
So embrace the GM life.

4799
05:00:27,360 --> 05:00:28,320
Embrace it.

4800
05:00:29,160 --> 05:00:31,780
That means you have a life.

4801
05:00:33,800 --> 05:00:35,620
Oh, so it's terminal.

4802
05:00:37,520 --> 05:00:38,620
It's good!

4803
05:00:39,140 --> 05:00:41,200
It's good!

4804
05:00:42,960 --> 05:00:45,580
When you play Marble Rivals.

4805
05:00:48,320 --> 05:00:51,220
I don't even have to- I can look at chat while I play Marble
Rivals.

4806
05:00:52,100 --> 05:00:53,540
Please shoot the squid.

4807
05:00:55,000 --> 05:00:57,200
You can be saved.

4808
05:00:57,860 --> 05:01:02,000
Thank you for the super- I think even tier 1 something.

4809

Yeah.

4817
05:01:48,730 --> 05:01:50,390
She's too far, God.

4818
05:01:51,750 --> 05:01:53,250
Is this what you tell a child?

4819
05:01:53,370 --> 05:01:55,970
If you were to say, I want to be just like you.

4820
05:01:56,690 --> 05:01:59,010
I'm like, you don't want to be just like me.

4821
05:02:00,410 --> 05:02:00,990
You don't.

4822
05:02:03,410 --> 05:02:04,450
You don't.

4823
05:02:04,550 --> 05:02:05,710
You don't want this.

4824
05:02:09,250 --> 05:02:10,430
Not like you.

4825
05:02:12,790 --> 05:02:14,790
Don't be like your hero.

4826
05:02:18,710 --> 05:02:20,430
Come back to me.

4827
05:02:25,080 --> 05:02:26,720
Listen, my child.

4828
05:02:27,180 --> 05:02:28,840
It's not too late for you.

4829
05:02:29,180 --> 05:02:31,380
We can still save you.

4830
05:02:33,300 --> 05:02:33,920
That is.

4831
05:02:34,600 --> 05:02:35,180
But yes.

4832
05:02:36,300 --> 05:02:44,620
really do you want to get better well obviously i don't know
how to do support for rank up if you do want to fucking rank

4833
05:02:44,620 --> 05:02:57,100
up as support play gambit that's it's you gotta learn oh but
then gambit will be meta for next season so play gambit if

4834
05:02:57,100 --> 05:03:06,580
it's not bad if it is then good luck or in fine i guess no
dps duo is better than tank duo i think dps does make it

4835
05:03:06,580 --> 05:03:07,620
more of an impact.

4836
05:03:09,700 --> 05:03:12,100
A DPS player that knows how to play tank.

4837
05:03:15,000 --> 05:03:16,560
Just, okay, here are the meta characters.

4838
05:03:16,720 --> 05:03:17,400
If you're a GM.

4839
05:03:19,240 --> 05:03:23,660
Invis, Gambit, Rocket, and Loki.

4840
05:03:24,540 --> 05:03:28,980
Everything else is like, if everything else is bad, you play
Luna, but Luna's still pretty dog shit.

4841
05:03:32,060 --> 05:03:33,600
Oh, Joki of the hot Elo.

4842
05:03:34,660 --> 05:03:36,220
How do I get to your Elo?

4843
05:03:36,300 --> 05:03:37,640
play gambit

4844
05:03:41,180 --> 05:03:48,380
having a DPS deal also means you're not getting a spotty OTP
oh it absolutely means you're gonna get a spotty OTP but it

4845
05:03:48,380 --> 05:03:56,500
it just means that it doesn't do anything you can never
avoid spotty OTPs

4846
05:04:05,190 --> 05:04:16,690
can I get out of Elohella by Hardmane Magneto no only
because only because there's so many every tank knows how to

4847
05:04:16,690 --> 05:04:30,190
play mag and it doesn't really matter it doesn't I think by
season 6 because mag has been meta for 6 seasons every tank

4848
05:04:30,190 --> 05:04:39,070
player has now learned how to play mag whether they like to
or not because if they don't play mag you lose because mag

4849
05:04:39,070 --> 05:04:50,790
just mag just counters every fucking support all and every
other dps so even if you're even your tank even if your tank

4850
05:04:50,790 --> 05:04:58,030
otp is not mag you eventually have to play mag if you're a
tank player that pool will be out in two days oh less than

4851
05:04:58,030 --> 05:05:09,650
two days a day in it's like 24 hours right yeah a day in
five hours so 29 hours he is unfortunately the best tank

4852
05:05:09,650 --> 05:05:15,130
right now i mean Like, the best way is to...

4853
05:05:15,130 --> 05:05:15,530
Oh, hey.

4854
05:05:15,870 --> 05:05:16,630
Everyone's just sitting.

4855
05:05:16,870 --> 05:05:18,370
It's just have good positioning.

4856
05:05:20,850 --> 05:05:23,190
He's got to have really good positioning, too.

4857
05:05:30,480 --> 05:05:32,280
Why do they love Mag and hate Strange?

4858
05:05:32,360 --> 05:05:33,640
Because Strange isn't meta anymore.

4859
05:05:34,940 --> 05:05:36,020
That's really it.

4860
05:05:36,400 --> 05:05:37,300
He's not meta.

4861
05:05:47,640 --> 05:05:48,520
Oh, it does.

4862
05:05:48,680 --> 05:05:50,840
Because Strange had it too good for too long.

4863
05:05:51,120 --> 05:05:52,480
But they don't want to target Mag.

4864
05:05:52,580 --> 05:05:54,980
Because then people will think they're racist towards
mutants.

4865
05:05:55,940 --> 05:05:56,920
Because he is literally...

4866
05:05:56,940 --> 05:05:58,460
the immunity representative.

4867
05:06:00,280 --> 05:06:01,660
They're just your cowards.

4868
05:06:05,580 --> 05:06:06,060
True!

4869
05:06:07,840 --> 05:06:08,940
Damn, dude.

4870
05:06:09,460 --> 05:06:11,960
They'll be like, oh, so you hate mutants, huh?

4871
05:06:11,960 --> 05:06:13,480
And you're like, oh, no, we won't.

4872
05:06:14,400 --> 05:06:16,320
That's why I went to the nerf bag!

4873
05:06:19,600 --> 05:06:21,080
That's one way.

4874
05:06:22,100 --> 05:06:22,840
But Emma, though.

4875
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:25,380
Emma is one of the strongest fucking tanks out there.

4876
05:06:25,500 --> 05:06:26,820
They buff all the mutants.

4877
05:06:26,940 --> 05:06:28,820
This is not a conspiracy.

4878
05:06:30,400 --> 05:06:31,940
I'm like a conspiracy theorist.

4879
05:06:32,180 --> 05:06:33,400
Guys, I swear to God.

4880
05:06:33,620 --> 05:06:34,740
They're buffing all the mutants.

4881
05:06:34,900 --> 05:06:36,660
They're trying to take over the world.

4882
05:06:41,450 --> 05:06:42,570
What do you mean?

4883
05:06:44,470 --> 05:06:45,250
I swear.

4884
05:06:45,670 --> 05:06:46,390
Best support.

4885
05:06:46,930 --> 05:06:48,830
Oh, Gambit and Luna.

4886
05:06:49,710 --> 05:06:50,670
Best DPS.

4887
05:06:51,770 --> 05:06:52,450
I don't know.

4888
05:06:52,850 --> 05:06:54,490
DPS is like a ballpark.

4889
05:06:54,690 --> 05:06:54,970
I don't know.

4890
05:06:55,110 --> 05:06:56,770
DPS is like everything, to be fair.

4891
05:06:57,050 --> 05:06:58,210
Scylok is always like...

4892
05:06:58,210 --> 05:06:58,730
Scylok!

4893
05:06:58,790 --> 05:06:59,690
and Phoenix.

4894
05:07:00,190 --> 05:07:00,910
Best tank?

4895
05:07:01,470 --> 05:07:02,630
Mag and Emma.

4896
05:07:03,290 --> 05:07:03,710
Oh.

4897
05:07:05,390 --> 05:07:07,710
This is no longer a conspiracy.

4898
05:07:11,130 --> 05:07:13,870
Why are the non-mutants always getting nerfed?

4899
05:07:14,170 --> 05:07:18,010
But then the mutants, all the mutants are getting buffed.

4900
05:07:23,050 --> 05:07:24,970
This is Magneto's America.

4901
05:07:27,030 --> 05:07:28,870
Wait, she has a point.

4902
05:07:29,330 --> 05:07:30,630
It's a fact.

4903
05:07:33,430 --> 05:07:34,390
Whoa!

4904
05:07:38,510 --> 05:07:40,430
That's crazy!

4905
05:07:42,710 --> 05:07:43,950
That's crazy!

4906
05:07:45,470 --> 05:07:46,910
That right, brother!

4907
05:07:48,050 --> 05:07:49,010
That right, brother.

4908
05:07:50,490 --> 05:07:52,970
Makes you think, doesn't it?

4909
05:07:53,650 --> 05:07:54,110
Anyway.

4910
05:07:55,870 --> 05:07:57,210
The water's making...

4911
05:07:57,210 --> 05:07:59,310
The water's making the frogs mutants!

4912
05:08:10,370 --> 05:08:11,650
That's crazy.

4913
05:08:14,290 --> 05:08:17,770
And then the non-munits are always getting nerfed.

4914
05:08:17,950 --> 05:08:19,130
What is this?

4915
05:08:21,430 --> 05:08:22,390
I'm J.

4916
05:08:22,630 --> 05:08:22,830
Jonas.

4917
05:08:23,630 --> 05:08:28,610
And there's like a guy on the cart.

4918
05:08:29,330 --> 05:08:31,870
There's like two guys on the two burly men on the cart.

4919
05:08:31,890 --> 05:08:32,890
aren't right now.

4920
05:08:37,200 --> 05:08:37,640
There we go.

4921
05:08:37,920 --> 05:08:39,540
How did we win that?

4922
05:08:39,700 --> 05:08:41,480
I guess because I didn't die?

4923
05:08:45,700 --> 05:08:48,420
Okay, I just assumed because I didn't die.

4924
05:08:49,400 --> 05:08:50,300
That's crazy.

4925
05:08:52,960 --> 05:08:53,300
JJ.

4926
05:08:53,540 --> 05:08:53,880
I'm the...

4927
05:08:53,880 --> 05:08:55,420
I'm anti-JJ.

4928
05:08:56,600 --> 05:08:57,800
It's like anti-venom.

4929
05:08:57,940 --> 05:08:58,900
I'm anti-JJ.

4930
05:08:59,580 --> 05:09:02,180
He fights for the mutants and I fight for the...

4931
05:09:02,180 --> 05:09:03,240
I...

4932
05:09:03,260 --> 05:09:04,560
I don't.

4933
05:09:06,040 --> 05:09:07,360
Relay deployed.

4934
05:09:07,600 --> 05:09:08,680
It ain't cheap.

4935
05:09:09,260 --> 05:09:10,460
You're halfway there.

4936
05:09:25,420 --> 05:09:27,800
Fuck it.

4937
05:09:28,100 --> 05:09:29,000
Fuck it.

4938
05:09:29,000 --> 05:09:31,320
Fuck it.

4939
05:09:31,320 --> 05:09:31,720
Fuck it.

4940
05:09:31,720 --> 05:09:33,600
Surely they kill somebody down there.

4941
05:09:37,560 --> 05:09:37,760
Nice.

4942
05:09:39,540 --> 05:09:39,960
Yeah.

4943
05:09:43,700 --> 05:09:44,500
Yeah.

4944
05:09:44,500 --> 05:09:44,540
Yeah.

4945
05:09:44,580 --> 05:09:44,660
Yeah.

4946
05:09:44,660 --> 05:09:44,680
Yeah.

4947
05:09:44,680 --> 05:09:44,700
Yeah.

4948
05:09:44,700 --> 05:09:44,740
Yeah.

4949
05:09:44,740 --> 05:09:46,680
I don't want pictures of Spider-Man.

4950
05:09:47,000 --> 05:09:47,300
Yeah.

4951
05:09:50,180 --> 05:09:52,620
The anti-JJ.

4952
05:09:53,240 --> 05:09:56,900
I apologize.

4953
05:09:58,280 --> 05:10:02,920
I appreciate that, G.

4954
05:10:05,980 --> 05:10:06,320
Okay.

4955
05:10:07,860 --> 05:10:13,000
Yeah, do not send me pictures of Spider-Man.

4956
05:10:14,020 --> 05:10:15,920
Yeah, what pictures of Rocket?

4957
05:10:17,780 --> 05:10:20,620
Literally, I'm getting that every fucking day.

4958
05:10:25,900 --> 05:10:27,640
She's Phoenix, guys.

4959
05:10:33,360 --> 05:10:34,840
Okay, that's in the open.

4960
05:10:35,000 --> 05:10:35,620
We don't want that.

4961
05:10:40,830 --> 05:10:42,210
Is this heading anywhere?

4962
05:10:42,850 --> 05:10:45,810
Oh, that's okay.

4963
05:10:46,230 --> 05:10:47,630
I do have res.

4964
05:10:54,660 --> 05:10:55,620
Where did he go?

4965
05:10:55,900 --> 05:10:57,200
Oh, he fucked up.

4966
05:11:00,360 --> 05:11:02,480
What is going on?

4967
05:11:05,220 --> 05:11:07,500
Like, what is going on?

4968
05:11:07,780 --> 05:11:08,180
What the fuck?

4969
05:11:09,040 --> 05:11:10,620
At least I can push guard now.

4970
05:11:12,640 --> 05:11:14,000
I want pictures of venom.

4971
05:11:14,500 --> 05:11:14,760
That's true.

4972
05:11:14,940 --> 05:11:15,160
That's true.

4973
05:11:15,300 --> 05:11:16,460
I want pictures of venom.

4974
05:11:18,240 --> 05:11:19,740
Give me pictures of venom.

4975
05:11:22,180 --> 05:11:23,420
Is this...

4976
05:11:23,420 --> 05:11:25,880
Unfortunately, this is not quickly.

4977
05:11:26,380 --> 05:11:26,500
Hmm.

4978
05:11:31,530 --> 05:11:37,430
Isn't it crazy that this is actually a regular game that I'm
playing right now?

4979
05:11:40,610 --> 05:11:43,370
Oh shit, is that Venom on our cart?

4980
05:11:44,250 --> 05:11:44,830
That's fine.

4981
05:11:45,170 --> 05:11:45,690
He's fine.

4982
05:11:46,730 --> 05:11:48,830
He might not be... He's fine still.

4983
05:11:54,350 --> 05:11:57,150
Okay, they're on triple support now.

4984
05:11:57,650 --> 05:12:00,030
From one... We have one support.

4985
05:12:01,430 --> 05:12:01,790
offer.

4986
05:12:02,030 --> 05:12:03,270
I give you one support.

4987
05:12:03,550 --> 05:12:05,130
They need to triple support.

4988
05:12:05,250 --> 05:12:05,910
That's crazy.

4989
05:12:07,450 --> 05:12:08,650
That's actually crazy.

4990
05:12:09,430 --> 05:12:11,630
And so there is a cloak right.

4991
05:12:11,870 --> 05:12:15,910
Okay, so we technically we missed question mark.

4992
05:12:16,650 --> 05:12:16,650
Oh.

4993
05:12:17,770 --> 05:12:19,130
Where did I put my res?

4994
05:12:21,410 --> 05:12:25,110
I think it's working.

4995
05:12:25,490 --> 05:12:26,010
There you go.

4996
05:12:31,380 --> 05:12:31,940
Alright, here you go.

4997
05:12:34,140 --> 05:12:34,600
That's wild.

4998
05:12:34,720 --> 05:12:39,340
Who would win one support or three supports or three DPS?

4999
05:12:41,260 --> 05:12:43,340
This is wild.

5000
05:12:45,100 --> 05:12:46,800
This is wild.

5001
05:12:47,480 --> 05:12:50,340
I think our DPS players are just better.

5002
05:12:52,000 --> 05:12:53,480
Like, I think...

5003
05:12:55,240 --> 05:12:56,360
Boxy, please.

5004
05:12:56,740 --> 05:13:01,840

05:13:39,500 --> 05:13:41,080
I'm one guy.

5010
05:13:41,720 --> 05:13:44,720
Like, all I do is just right click.

5011
05:13:46,220 --> 05:13:49,080
That's all I can do.

5012
05:13:52,540 --> 05:13:54,880
That's all I can do.

5013
05:13:56,580 --> 05:13:59,540
You can't blame me for anything.

5014
05:14:04,700 --> 05:14:06,620
Oh, my God.

5015
05:14:06,760 --> 05:14:07,180
Goodbye.

5016
05:14:09,180 --> 05:14:10,040
Good luck, Moxie.

5017
05:14:12,080 --> 05:14:12,560
Okay.

5018
05:14:13,140 --> 05:14:14,220
Oh, that is unfortunate.

5019
05:14:15,020 --> 05:14:16,180
That is also unfortunate.

5020
05:14:17,080 --> 05:14:18,080
It's okay, he comes back.

5021
05:14:18,220 --> 05:14:20,200
He can, okay, he can not come back from this.

5022
05:14:23,640 --> 05:14:24,380
It's okay.

5023
05:14:25,540 --> 05:14:28,100
I do have, oh, oh, oh, oh, Ultron?

5024
05:14:28,340 --> 05:14:31,500
Ultron, we have decided to run another.

5025
05:14:33,400 --> 05:14:34,020
All right.

5026
05:14:38,000 --> 05:14:38,440
Goodbye

5027
05:14:41,620 --> 05:14:42,540
Where is he?

5028
05:14:43,060 --> 05:14:52,340
Wait, he's he's he didn't do it All right, here we go Click
hard There you go.

5029
05:14:52,460 --> 05:14:53,960
Is that hard enough?

5030
05:14:54,800 --> 05:14:54,960
Yeah

5031
05:14:59,380 --> 05:15:02,100
It is a little weird that we oh my god.

5032
05:15:02,220 --> 05:15:02,800
They're running true.

5033
05:15:02,880 --> 05:15:10,520
I don't I think they just don't have DPS players I think the
enemy team just have zero DPS players.

5034
05:15:10,980 --> 05:15:11,560
I think...

5035
05:15:13,140 --> 05:15:14,420
That's crazy.

5036
05:15:17,040 --> 05:15:17,480
Okay.

5037
05:15:18,220 --> 05:15:19,960
I legitimately think that...

5038
05:15:19,960 --> 05:15:22,300
I think that this team just have zero.

5039
05:15:22,480 --> 05:15:24,460
I think we're at three takes, three supports.

5040
05:15:24,980 --> 05:15:27,380
I think we took all the DPS players.

5041
05:15:29,380 --> 05:15:31,260
Yeah, we stole all of them.

5042
05:15:37,930 --> 05:15:38,850
That's insane.

5043
05:15:39,070 --> 05:15:39,810
Round two.

5044
05:15:40,910 --> 05:15:42,910
I don't know how we like...

5045
05:15:47,590 --> 05:15:50,550
I have no idea how that happened.

5046
05:15:53,450 --> 05:15:54,570
We snuffed it all up.

5047
05:15:55,210 --> 05:15:57,210
Our team literally had all the DPS base.

5048
05:16:01,710 --> 05:16:02,770
Let's go!

5049
05:16:05,790 --> 05:16:14,090
But anyway, as I was saying about my mutant propaganda, like
anti-propaganda, Yeah, anti-mutant propaganda every

5050
05:16:14,090 --> 05:16:23,310
character that's been a mutant has been either buffed or Not
touched yet every non-mutant character has been nerfed to a

5051
05:16:23,310 --> 05:16:28,590
Bolivian Coincidence I think not

5052
05:16:36,590 --> 05:16:43,710
That's no coincidence in my book Well, I think the Jeff is
now a DPS, though.

5053
05:16:48,420 --> 05:16:50,840
I'm just trying to heal our Thor.

5054
05:16:56,260 --> 05:16:58,040
No, she's dead.

5055
05:16:59,180 --> 05:17:00,380
She's dead.

5056
05:17:04,480 --> 05:17:05,960
Guys, it's just me.

5057
05:17:08,560 --> 05:17:10,280
Guys, you are...

5058
05:17:10,280 --> 05:17:13,640
You are unfortunately taking a lot of damage.

5059
05:17:17,310 --> 05:17:18,690
They don't know.

5060
05:17:24,150 --> 05:17:25,330
They don't know.

5061
05:17:31,070 --> 05:17:33,790
Oh my god, this doesn't...

5062
05:17:35,740 --> 05:17:37,300
Oh no.

5063
05:17:39,140 --> 05:17:39,520
It's okay.

5064
05:17:40,320 --> 05:17:41,140
I flew up.

5065
05:17:45,080 --> 05:17:46,240
It's awkward.

5066
05:17:46,740 --> 05:17:47,520
It's awkward.

5067
05:17:47,900 --> 05:17:49,900
Oh my god, that's so awkward.

5068
05:17:50,080 --> 05:17:50,420
No!

5069
05:17:50,480 --> 05:17:51,360
She ran away!

5070
05:17:53,120 --> 05:17:55,620
The Luna ran away!

5071
05:18:01,380 --> 05:18:02,960

05:18:05,060 --> 05:18:08,920
Okay, I did not expect it to fucking flyer.

5074
05:18:09,220 --> 05:18:11,700
My throw was just...

5075
05:18:11,700 --> 05:18:13,760
I just didn't know my strength.

5076
05:18:14,040 --> 05:18:14,720
Okay, guys.

5079
05:18:21,940 --> 05:18:24,480
I just didn't know I was that strong.

5080
05:18:26,380 --> 05:18:28,300
Guys, I just didn't know.

5081
05:18:40,550 --> 05:18:43,190
I didn't like mutants.

5082
05:18:45,030 --> 05:18:45,810
Bro, it's not my fault.

5083
05:18:45,910 --> 05:18:47,370

05:27:04,420 --> 05:27:09,120
we we stop when we lose a game which could potentially be
this game.

5177
05:27:14,230 --> 05:27:16,010
It could potentially be this one.

5178
05:27:16,570 --> 05:27:18,330
But we had a good run.

5179
05:27:18,570 --> 05:27:21,610
We had a really good run, guys.

5180
05:27:23,430 --> 05:27:25,190
You have to admit.

5181
05:27:28,470 --> 05:27:30,610
When we lose a two game.

5182
05:27:30,830 --> 05:27:32,410
Yeah, but then you're going to start a cycle.

5183
05:27:32,570 --> 05:27:36,450
It'll be like, oh, but what if we lose three games?

5184
05:27:36,690 --> 05:27:37,970
Oh, you won a game.

5185
05:27:37,970 --> 05:27:39,810
You can't stop on a...

5186
05:27:39,810 --> 05:27:41,590
You can't stop on a win.

5187
05:27:41,710 --> 05:27:43,870
A win streak is here.

5188
05:27:44,970 --> 05:27:46,470
I know your games.

5189
05:27:48,550 --> 05:27:50,450
Erica, what were you saying to me last game?

5190
05:27:53,370 --> 05:27:53,710
What?

5191
05:27:53,930 --> 05:27:54,390
Wait, what?

5192
05:27:54,410 --> 05:27:55,210
What was worse?

5193
05:27:56,190 --> 05:27:57,090
What did they say?

5194
05:27:57,150 --> 05:27:59,110
You need a top-notch team to win this one.

5195
05:28:00,310 --> 05:28:01,990
Oh, I must have missed the...

5196
05:28:01,990 --> 05:28:04,350
Oh, my gun...

5197
05:28:04,350 --> 05:28:04,590
Cool.

5198
05:28:08,890 --> 05:28:09,450
What?

5199
05:28:16,140 --> 05:28:18,780
Okay, I get it now.

5200
05:28:19,100 --> 05:28:21,500
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

5201
05:28:22,780 --> 05:28:23,480
I get it.

5202
05:28:23,940 --> 05:28:25,080
It took me a while.

5203
05:28:26,420 --> 05:28:27,640
He's like, oh.

5204
05:28:32,880 --> 05:28:36,540
Yeah, you were saying like crazy words in the old chat.

5205
05:28:37,940 --> 05:28:40,940
Oh, like I was asking like if my gun tasted good.

5206
05:28:41,740 --> 05:28:55,760
before you attack you know get ready oh well how did they
yeah very i like did it taste bad like um i have covet so i

5207
05:28:55,760 --> 05:28:57,180

05:29:02,000 --> 05:29:13,760
oh damn solid response good response good response two one
Most normal rival.

5209
05:29:16,780 --> 05:29:17,460
I'm not ashamed.

5210
05:29:18,880 --> 05:29:18,940
Oh.

5211
05:29:26,240 --> 05:29:27,980
It's okay, I got you, girl.

5212
05:29:29,560 --> 05:29:31,620
We gotta protect the gaunt.

5213
05:29:35,240 --> 05:29:37,480
We gotta help her.

5214
05:29:39,240 --> 05:29:41,520
Oh my god, I tried to fucking heal.

5215
05:29:41,980 --> 05:29:44,320
Holy shit, that's a fast up.

5216
05:29:51,280 --> 05:29:52,600
Protect what?

5217
05:30:03,010 --> 05:30:04,690
Oh my god.

5218
05:30:08,650 --> 05:30:09,710
Oh my god, he's so low.

5219
05:30:10,630 --> 05:30:12,730
That was such a good pull too.

5220
05:30:19,410 --> 05:30:19,790
Okay.

5221
05:30:27,390 --> 05:30:27,710
Oh.

5222
05:30:30,050 --> 05:30:30,550
Hello.

5223
05:30:30,670 --> 05:30:31,170
Oh, goodbye.

5224
05:30:36,250 --> 05:30:36,350
Oh.

5225
05:30:43,930 --> 05:30:44,590
Well.

5226
05:30:45,030 --> 05:30:45,490
Oh.

5227
05:30:46,590 --> 05:30:54,190
Oh, we'll be fine, right?

5228
05:30:55,590 --> 05:30:56,310
He's gonna...

5229
05:30:56,310 --> 05:30:59,550
Oh my

5230
05:31:02,650 --> 05:31:03,870
god, that's scared of shit.

5231
05:31:04,370 --> 05:31:07,430
He doesn't know where I am.

5232
05:31:08,790 --> 05:31:13,130
He's like, surely, surely she's right here.

5233
05:31:14,750 --> 05:31:17,070
She jumped, she has to be in the air.

5234
05:31:18,650 --> 05:31:30,610
right now surely that's crazy surely she's flying right oh

5235
05:31:36,390 --> 05:31:52,390

play rocket this is too much are you serious okay it's okay

5236
05:31:57,760 --> 05:32:10,360
Oh, oh, we don't have support Come on, keep backing up There
you go I'm here too much thinking you saw how easy it was

5237
05:32:10,360 --> 05:32:19,300
how easy it was when we were on oh nice, okay When we were
on rocket no think just shoot.

5238
05:32:19,340 --> 05:32:29,300
Jeez, please Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa Whoa, whoa Oh
Oh All right, it's fine.

5239
05:32:31,760 --> 05:32:32,200
Amun...

5240
05:32:32,200 --> 05:32:35,580
We have been getting a lot of...

5241
05:32:38,510 --> 05:32:42,090
I will say, we've been getting a lot of...

5242
05:32:46,340 --> 05:32:47,220
Thor players.

5243
05:32:48,260 --> 05:32:50,200
And Moon Knight players, too.

5244
05:32:52,160 --> 05:32:54,040
A lot of Moon Knight and Thor players in general.

5245
05:32:54,140 --> 05:32:55,520
I'm going to let our Luna build up.

5246
05:32:57,660 --> 05:32:58,940
Never mind, I gotta save him.

5247
05:33:05,090 --> 05:33:05,730
Oh,

5248
05:33:10,200 --> 05:33:10,960
that's unfortunate.

5249
05:33:15,200 --> 05:33:17,140
That is very unfortunate.

5250
05:33:18,920 --> 05:33:20,700
Oh fuck, I thought he was gonna up.

5251
05:33:22,400 --> 05:33:23,160
That's unlucky.

5252
05:33:25,080 --> 05:33:28,440
Wait, okay, I'll let Luna go first.

5253
05:33:30,320 --> 05:33:31,260
All right, you can go first.

5254
05:33:33,780 --> 05:33:34,920
Yeah, Luna go first.

5255
05:33:38,020 --> 05:33:39,640
Yeah, I thought she was ulting first.

5256
05:33:39,800 --> 05:33:41,700
Because she ulted first last time.

5257
05:33:42,100 --> 05:33:48,060
So, but, you know, pattern-wise, pattern-wise, it would stay
the same.

5258
05:33:49,480 --> 05:33:50,100
There you go.

5259
05:33:50,940 --> 05:33:52,060
You know, you won't...

5260
05:33:58,960 --> 05:34:00,260
You need a rule of...

5261
05:34:02,140 --> 05:34:02,700
Alright.

5262
05:34:04,380 --> 05:34:04,680
That...

5263
05:34:04,680 --> 05:34:06,400
Oh, that pull was sick!

5264
05:34:06,800 --> 05:34:08,540
Oh, I am very sorry.

5265
05:34:11,120 --> 05:34:12,240
Get pulled.

5266
05:34:12,260 --> 05:34:23,260
I'll get pulled for the sake of it just for fun Okay, I do
What?

5267
05:34:24,740 --> 05:34:25,800
Oh my god

5268
05:34:31,020 --> 05:34:43,980
Oh, that's so unlucky that is so that was bullshit That was
bullshit I did not think I didn't think I would die from

5269
05:34:43,980 --> 05:34:44,440
that.

5270
05:34:45,200 --> 05:34:47,140
I should have fucking ulted earlier.

5271
05:34:48,460 --> 05:34:49,600
That was my bad.

5272
05:34:52,620 --> 05:34:53,340
Please.

5273
05:34:56,340 --> 05:34:58,080
I'm protecting you.

5274
05:34:58,760 --> 05:35:00,360
Like a good support.

5275
05:35:04,020 --> 05:35:05,240
Oh my god.

5276
05:35:06,700 --> 05:35:10,940
I will think it might be easier if I'm dead here.

5277
05:35:11,620 --> 05:35:11,980
Yeah.

5278
05:35:12,500 --> 05:35:13,800
I think it might be.

5279
05:35:13,820 --> 05:35:16,620
be easier if we run in this Loki.

5280
05:35:16,860 --> 05:35:20,560
I think this person is a Lula one trick though.

5281
05:35:22,120 --> 05:35:23,360
Because Loki is just too strong.

5282
05:35:23,520 --> 05:35:25,920
She might be ace, but Loki is just way too good.

5283
05:35:28,860 --> 05:35:33,180
It just the tempo wise is better for our team.

5284
05:35:37,990 --> 05:35:38,610
Alright here.

5285
05:35:47,450 --> 05:35:48,210
What's going?

5286
05:35:48,810 --> 05:35:49,050
Oh.

5287
05:36:01,940 --> 05:36:03,700
Oh my god, I just got y'all.

5288
05:36:04,120 --> 05:36:07,960
The current score is 1, 2, 0.

5289
05:36:08,480 --> 05:36:10,340
I literally just got it too.

5290
05:36:10,680 --> 05:36:12,000
Time to switch things up.

5291
05:36:12,320 --> 05:36:13,980
Including which side you're on.

5292
05:36:14,220 --> 05:36:17,420
I think Loki's just a better pick overall.

5293
05:36:18,500 --> 05:36:21,060
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

5294
05:36:22,440 --> 05:36:24,640
Would it be nice to get a better DPS than Moon Knight?

5295
05:36:24,660 --> 05:36:26,180
He is doing a lot though.

5296
05:36:26,500 --> 05:36:28,840
He's getting alt like fucking crazy.

5297
05:36:29,980 --> 05:36:39,680
I just think like momentum wise it'd be easier with loki
only because his in barn and like we can have double

5298
05:36:39,680 --> 05:36:49,200
invisible i don't think double i don't think luno is like as
strong invisible is just too good

5299
05:36:57,860 --> 05:37:09,680
i knew guys i told you i told you guys this way it needed to
end somewhere Guan Guan gave me an Audi.

5300
05:37:12,660 --> 05:37:14,480
He gave me an Audi.

5301
05:37:15,240 --> 05:37:17,080
Because I was like, I'll play until I lose.

5302
05:37:17,200 --> 05:37:19,100
And he was like, this is it.

5303
05:37:19,160 --> 05:37:20,440
Right here.

5304
05:37:20,920 --> 05:37:23,000
You deserve it.

5305
05:37:24,620 --> 05:37:26,380
You deserve it.

5306
05:37:27,580 --> 05:37:28,220
An Audi.

5307
05:37:41,240 --> 05:37:41,880
Okay.

5308
05:37:46,360 --> 05:37:47,400
Oh my god.

5309
05:37:47,480 --> 05:37:49,580
He actually dodged it the moment.

5310
05:37:49,960 --> 05:37:53,920
Oh, I forgot to ref- I forgot to pull my fucking shield
back, though.

5311
05:37:54,400 --> 05:37:55,220
That's not good.

5312
05:37:58,600 --> 05:37:59,280
Drop me.

5313
05:38:00,260 --> 05:38:01,660
Oh, but he's so low!

5314
05:38:09,350 --> 05:38:10,130
Oh, God.

5315
05:38:10,370 --> 05:38:10,650
Oh, yeah.

5316
05:38:11,070 --> 05:38:11,450
No!

5317
05:38:19,110 --> 05:38:19,950
Oh, fuck.

5318
05:38:20,050 --> 05:38:20,470
Okay, here.

5319
05:38:25,940 --> 05:38:26,980
I'm gonna try.

5320
05:38:33,720 --> 05:38:34,240
Okay.

5321
05:38:36,640 --> 05:38:37,600
I don't know what...

5322
05:38:37,620 --> 05:38:38,900
happen to my Luna, though.

5323
05:38:49,150 --> 05:38:50,270
I literally just got it.

5324
05:38:51,350 --> 05:38:52,790
I literally just got my...

5325
05:38:52,790 --> 05:38:53,770
That sucks.

5326
05:38:55,390 --> 05:38:57,290
I don't know what happened to my Luna, though.

5327
05:38:58,050 --> 05:38:59,770
I had to push up.

5328
05:39:04,880 --> 05:39:05,840
I mean...

5329
05:39:05,840 --> 05:39:06,980
I should kill him.

5330
05:39:07,100 --> 05:39:08,060
Yeah, I didn't see it.

5331
05:39:11,140 --> 05:39:12,960
I mean, I can ult this.

5332
05:39:23,120 --> 05:39:24,380
Oh, we have a...

5333
05:39:24,380 --> 05:39:24,820
You know what?

5334
05:39:24,920 --> 05:39:25,300
Fuck it.

5335
05:39:25,320 --> 05:39:25,560
You know what?

5336
05:39:25,580 --> 05:39:25,820
Let's go.

5337
05:39:25,840 --> 05:39:26,320
Let's go.

5338
05:39:28,020 --> 05:39:29,080
But never mind.

5339
05:39:29,260 --> 05:39:29,760
Let's not go.

5340
05:39:34,550 --> 05:39:34,970
I'm helping.

5341
05:39:35,150 --> 05:39:35,390
I'm fucking.

5342
05:39:35,510 --> 05:39:35,750
Let's go.

5343
05:39:35,810 --> 05:39:35,990
Let's go.

5344
05:39:36,150 --> 05:39:36,350
Let's go.

5345
05:39:39,430 --> 05:39:42,030
Our guy was gonna die, but I didn't do it.

5346
05:39:43,950 --> 05:39:45,330
I had to save his life.

5347
05:39:46,810 --> 05:39:47,910
I had to start something.

5348
05:39:54,500 --> 05:39:55,820
I had to start something.

5349
05:39:56,740 --> 05:39:57,880
I had to start a war.

5350
05:40:01,760 --> 05:40:03,120
I hear something, though.

5351
05:40:03,880 --> 05:40:05,760
I hear some clicky clackies.

5352
05:40:20,610 --> 05:40:24,710
