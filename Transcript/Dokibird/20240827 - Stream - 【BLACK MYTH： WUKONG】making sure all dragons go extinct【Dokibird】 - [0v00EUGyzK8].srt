1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,740
Sorry, I'm like a little dead inside.

3
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,340
Alright, um, alright.

4
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,160
Little life update.

5
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,420
A little life update.

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Sorry, I fucking...

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:14,660
I'm not tired because like, um, since like, you know, dad always wakes me up at a reasonable, quote unquote, reasonable time every morning.

8
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,660
Uh, cause you know, he needs to eat and... he needs to eat and have a walkies.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,880
Um, anyway, uh, yesterday... did I sleep?

10
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,660
Uh...

11
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,720
Um, you know, I thought that like, yesterday... yesterday, I thought that like, you know, um...

12
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,260
You know, that everything will be okay.

13
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,540
And that like, I beat the addiction.

14
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,840
And that like, you know, um, things will be okay.

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,160
And then I got a message from a friend who was like, You wanna play some Overwatch?

16
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,180
I was ready to get some work done.

17
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,660
And I was ready, um, I was like locked in and ready to do it.

18
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,340
And then I got the message.

19
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,940
You wanna play some Overwatch?

20
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:14,820
Yeah.

21
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,680
And then I'm back every time.

22
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,260
I... Every time...

23
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,280
Doki don't you have a say, don't you have a Street Fighter tournament?

24
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,700
Should you?

25
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,320
Sh...

26
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,760
That's what my friend said.

27
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,780
Like, one of my friends was like, Why are you always complaining about... like...

28
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:57,040
You're always complaining about how all the players in the beginning division is grinding so much and then you're out here playing Overwatch instead of practicing for City Champs.

29
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,080
This is not what matters right now.

30
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,060
This is not what matters right now.

31
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,170
Look, I don't have a coach yet.

32
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,010
So like...

33
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,850
I don't have a coach yet.

34
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,850
So like...

35
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,950
What's the point of learning right now if like, you know...

36
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,670
I don't know what I'm doing.

37
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,790
Anyway...

38
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,450
So then I went to bed at 6 in the morning today.

39
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,470
It just takes...

40
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,070
It only takes one message.

41
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,770
Chat.

42
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,450
And then I'm back in it.

43
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,810
I would be like...

44
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,230
Oh my god.

45
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,070
Oh my god.

46
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,530
It's so...

47
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,730
I've been so good to myself.

48
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,770
I haven't...

49
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,070
I haven't...

50
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,690
I haven't played Overwatch in a couple of days.

51
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,390
I've been so good at this.

52
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,370
And then all it takes is one message.

53
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,710
What?

54
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,910
Do you want to play Overwatch?

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,410
And then...

56
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,630
And then I...

57
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,850
I blink...

58
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,150
I close my eyes.

59
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,830
And I open my eyes.

60
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,170
And it's 6 in the morning.

61
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,930
It's like you're trapped in this Overwatch trance.

62
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,050
Like time just passes by so fast.

63
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,250
And then you're just like...

64
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,810
What happened?

65
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,130
I thought it was still 10pm.

66
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,990
When did the sun come out?

67
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,530
When did the sun come out?

68
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,510
Yes, I've been in Bastards for like a week now.

69
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,900
Anyway...

70
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,780
Anyway...

71
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll be okay for today.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,080
As long as nobody sends me a message.

73
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,320
As long as nobody sends me a message.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
I will not relapse.

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,500
I will not relapse back into it.

76
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,540
Um...

77
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,120
Look.

78
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,800
It's not...

79
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,320
It's not just me.

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,700
It's my surroundings.

81
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,520
It's not...

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,080
It's not just my fuzz.

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,760
It's my...

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,900
It's my surroundings.

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,680
I don't know.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:35,640
I have the willpower to not solo queue anymore, um, for now, but, but like, whenever somebody messages me, then, then I just, I, I close my eyes, and then it's 6am.

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,920
Yeah, anyway, anyway, so, you know what's funny?

88
00:06:43,140 --> 00:07:00,280
I thought it was so funny that, like, uh, tweeting out I'm a Honda main, um, reveals how so many people, um, revealed how so many people did not watch the Street Fighter stream yesterday.

89
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:14,180
I was like, I was like, it exposed all of you, it worked, but it worked!

90
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:33,720
I told you guys, I, I make everyone think I'm a Honda main, so everybody's gonna train, like, everybody's, except for Goomy, everybody's gonna train just exclusively, um, for Honda, and then, I love how someone's like, I'm a Toyota main, that was, that was pretty good.

91
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:54,120
That's the only reason why I tweeted it out, uh, it's just, I was like, I wanted to confuse everybody, so, like, everybody will think I literally made a Honda, and then everybody's gonna be training for it, and nobody will expect when I pull out my real main,

92
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,940
Akuma.

93
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,940
I, the Twitter mix-up, exactly, um, it's, it's the mix-up that no one's ever prepared for.

94
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,620
Uh, I flipped the script.

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,820
Yeah, I flipped it.

96
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:19,120
I just thought it was so funny, like, so many people actually, actually think that I'm maining, maining him.

97
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,720
Um, hi, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

98
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,960
Please take care of yourself, young lady.

99
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,660
It only takes one hit.

100
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,280
One message, and I'm back, I'm back at it again.

101
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,540
No!

102
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,660
One of my friends actually DMed me saying, Overwatch, alright, guys, I'm gonna change the stream, we're gonna play some Overwatch.

103
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,820
No, I'm joking, I'm joking, it's monkey day, it's, it's monkey week, guys.

104
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:02,160
I hope you guys are not tired of monkey, I know, like, everybody and their fucking moms and dads and, like, unborn children are playing Wukong now.

105
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,340
Um, and, like, I found out this game is actually 30 to 40 hours long.

106
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,380
Um.

107
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,200
Which is, which is a lot longer than I thought.

108
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:27,780
When they said it, I was like, oh, six chapters, that can't be that bad, I mean, six is not, I mean, Dead Space has, like, 12 plus chapters, and that's not 20 to, that's not, like, 30 hours long, oh, my gosh.

109
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,700
Um.

110
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:38,140
30 of you skip, yes, 30 of you skip optional content, too, and I think I've done, like, every single, like, boss, like, even the optional bosses, too.

111
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:51,220
Um, and I, like, I don't mind doing the optional bosses, because it just levels me up, and, like, it just helps me in the long run, in the, in the long run for, like, um, for the, like, mandatory late stage bosses.

112
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:07,080
Anyway, uh, please let me know if there's stutters or anything, because, like, uh, I actually, um, remember when, like, uh, yesterday, not yesterday, last Wukong stream, people were like, oh, man, you're, you're stuttering and stuff.

113
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
And it has, like, a lot of stutters.

114
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,160
And it has, like, and then you guys gaslighted me into thinking it was YouTube.

115
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,440
It was not YouTube.

116
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,920
It was actually on my end.

117
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,680
It was actually on his.

118
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,260
It was actually me, guys.

119
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,540
And I was like, oh, my God, thank God.

120
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,240
Everyone on last stream, I was like, oh, man, I feel like it's me, guys.

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,340
They're like, no, it's YouTube.

122
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,820
And it's like, oh, okay.

123
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,560
Okay.

124
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,320
And I was like, I always think it's my fault, because, like, I'm cursed with forever.

125
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,380
I knew I was the problem.

126
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,180
I knew it.

127
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,800
Deep down, when you guys were like...

128
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,580
Oh, it's YouTube.

129
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,820
Deep down, I knew it was me.

130
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,940
I knew it was me.

131
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,560
I was like, maybe it's me.

132
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,980
There's always me.

133
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,120
It's always...

134
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
It's always...

135
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,900
So, the mods and I, the mods and I, we were, like, messing about with, like, the settings and everything.

136
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,580
We sort of fixed our CPU issue.

137
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,140
So, every time, like, last Wukong stream, we went to 100% CPU.

138
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,560
And I think, I don't know, guys, it could be that.

139
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,280
Like, I don't think I should have been at 100% CPU when I was streaming Wukong.

140
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,360
But I don't remember what we did.

141
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,320
Oh, yeah, we...

142
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,800
I had one of my tech friends also help me.

143
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,000
And they did TeamViewer and, like, helped me, like, I don't know.

144
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,340
I don't know what the fuck he did.

145
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,780
Like, he's in, like...

146
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,060
Text...

147
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,420
Support.

148
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,420
So, like, I don't know what he did.

149
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,340
But he was, like...

150
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,060
I was, like, watching him just do stuff on my PC.

151
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,980
Like, turning settings off.

152
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,280
By the way, I wasn't on admin mode, by the way, for OBS.

153
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,260
Because, like, I was lazy.

154
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,940
And so...

155
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,800
Because, like, I know there was a way to make it so that you can boot up OBS in admin mode, like, automatically.

156
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,620
Like, just clicking it instead of, like, right-click at...

157
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,460
Sorry, in admin mode.

158
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,540
But I was, like, I was a bit lazy in, like, you know, just a little bit.

159
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,000
And, like, trying to figure out how to do that.

160
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,700
So, my friend made sure that everything I boot up now will be in admin mode.

161
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,640
So, like, that's also a good thing.

162
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,320
So, now my CPU is at 52% instead of, you know, 100%.

163
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,220
But if there are any stutters, please let me know.

164
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,420
So, then, like, then we know that I didn't fix the problem.

165
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,020
And...

166
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,440
Then we know that I didn't fix the problem.

167
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,700
So, yes, I'm taking my friend's credit.

168
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,820
Then, did you two just...

169
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,880
No, don't gaslight me.

170
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,200
Don't fucking gaslight me.

171
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,520
Anyway, then we know that, like, we didn't fix the problem.

172
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,680
Then I know that my friend didn't fix the problem.

173
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,580
Yes, now that there's a problem, I'm blaming him instead of me.

174
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,680
Because I take credit.

175
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,360
I take credit when good stuff happens.

176
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,400
And then I blame others when bad stuff happens.

177
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,240
Because that is the life of a streamer.

178
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,860
We have...

179
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,900
It's never our fault.

180
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,640
Anyway.

181
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,240
Anyway.

182
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,660
As I was saying, I start...

183
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,720
Don't say that!

184
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
Don't fucking say...

185
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,920
I start saying...

186
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,880
Come on.

187
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
Because now I don't know.

188
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,420
Now I don't know if you're saying that to fuck with me.

189
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,820
Or if it's actually true.

190
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,740
Like, the game isn't even on.

191
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,960
Like, it started for real.

192
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,680
For real.

193
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,260
Fuck you guys.

194
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,960
Anyway.

195
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,720
Because now I won't know until the stream is over.

196
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,600
If it actually is stuttering.

197
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,860
Okay, where was I?

198
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,200
Fuck.

199
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,860
Now I lost my train of thought.

200
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,680
Because I got angry.

201
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,860
Now I lost my train of thought.

202
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Anyway.

203
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,780
Oh, fuck.

204
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,580
What was my train of thought?

205
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,340
Don't worry for the stutter.

206
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,100
I have ADHD.

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,120
Kara, thank you for the super chat.

208
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,880
Thank you.

209
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,580
Thank you.

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,620
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

211
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,040
Thank you.

212
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,560
Thank you.

213
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,520
Hi, Toki.

214
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,420
It's my birthday today.

215
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,420
And my family is six that are isolating right now.

216
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,220
Thank you for streaming.

217
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,240
Making my day a little better.

218
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,680
Thank you.

219
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:35,860
Thank you.

220
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,120
Thank you for the super chat.

221
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,560
Thank you.

222
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,180
Thank you.

223
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,480
Happy birthday to you.

224
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
Happy birthday to you.

225
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,980
Happy birthday dear Liam.

226
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,360
Happy birthday to you.

227
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:44,700
Yeah.

228
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,720
Happy birthday.

229
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
Anyway, I'm glad you're enjoying the stream.

230
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,860
Even though you're just looking at a black screen right now.

231
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,700
Fuck, where was I?

232
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,180
Okay, where was I before Wukong?

233
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,220
I don't even know what I was talking about before Wukong.

234
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,000
Um, this is the streamer brain rot at this point.

235
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:27,620
Uh, but yes, anyway, so like, please let me know if there's actual real fucking stutters, um, and, and not trying to, I, I would really appreciate it if you guys don't gaslight me, but yes, we believe we might have fixed the issue.

236
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,880
So, uh, so we'll see on this Wukong stream.

237
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,480
I'm sorry for, I know a lot of people were like, where's god of war?

238
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:35,860
I'm sorry for, I know a lot of people were like, where's god of war?

239
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:35,860
I'm sorry for, I know a lot of people were like, where's god of war?

240
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:35,860
I'm sorry for, I know a lot of people were like, where's god of war?

241
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:46,180
Um, the reason why we're focusing on Wukong instead of god of war is that, um, it's because, uh, I've been very addicted to monkeys.

242
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:56,940
So, and like, uh, I don't like playing two story games at the same time because, uh, I would, like, lose track of the story.

243
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:05,640
Uh, I would lose track of the story and then, like, I would forget the controls, uh, because I have, there's just too many stuff going on.

244
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,600
Um, back to back to back.

245
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,900
So, that's why I'm focusing on Wukong and then we'll do, and then we'll do the cooler god.

246
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,380
Don't say that because you'll actually piss off the god of war, uh, fans.

247
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,940
They'll get very mad.

248
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,560
Anyway, that's the hill you die on.

249
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,420
That's not me.

250
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,360
I, I am just a bystander.

251
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,520
I just, they're all good.

252
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,140
Games.

253
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:48,100
I, I, uh, the one, one of one, so I, I do get into video game arguments, but, like, I know when to, like, I know when to, like, you know, back off.

254
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,960
Because, like, there are some video game arguments you don't get involved in.

255
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,820
Like, I could be, like, yeah, like, I, I would say that I think Deadlock is not fun.

256
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,220
But, cause, cause, like, it's League.

257
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,800
It's, like, I got tricked.

258
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,420
Cause, like, it's fucking League.

259
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,200
Um, but, like, that's something I can say.

260
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,760
Because, it's, like, it, cause some people, like, were, like, yeah, like, as someone who doesn't like League.

261
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,640
Yeah, you're right.

262
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,200
If you like League, then you'll like it.

263
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,780
But, like, I fucking hate League.

264
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,920
And I can say I hate League.

265
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,720
Because, um, even League players hate League.

266
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,460
So, like, that's fine to say.

267
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,420
But, like, hey, there are some video game arguments, uh, that you should not get involved in.

268
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,420
It's dope.

269
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Okay, it's dope.

270
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,600
And not League.

271
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,760
To me, they're all the same.

272
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,900
To me, League and Dota, you watch your mouth, Toki.

275
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,160
League and Dota, to me, are just the same to me.

276
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
Take that back!

277
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,060
They're different!

278
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,040
You're right.

279
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,360
League is actually popular.

280
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,120
I know!

281
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,930
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

282
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,930
Okay.

283
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,390
Holy... take... that... back!

284
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,530
Uh... JL, thank you for the... Akasupa!

285
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,770
Thank you, thank you.

286
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,550
Hi, Toki.

287
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,210
I was born under the Steel Monkey.

288
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,530
So I send you my Steel Monkey Energy!

289
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,870
May it boost you in Wukong!

290
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,270
Thank you for the Akasupa!

291
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:32,970
Thank you!

292
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,630
Thank you!

293
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,790
Alright.

294
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,730
So, yes, I'm willing to attack.

295
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,370
Like...

296
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:46,410
Like I said, there are some video game arguments that I'm willing to get involved in, and there are some I'm not.

297
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,090
I like how I decided to piss off League and Dota players.

298
00:18:52,930 --> 00:19:01,950
So like, you know, with League, that would be like, you know, 90% of my chat, and then like the 1% of Dota players.

299
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,510
That's fucked up.

300
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,790
That's fucked up.

301
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,710
Alright.

302
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,490
Beep boop, Jesus, because he was right.

303
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,510
Yeah, yeah, thank you for the super chat.

304
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,690
Thank you, thank you.

305
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,730
Anyway, anyway, I'm looking forward to play some more Wukong, some more Monkey.

306
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,370
Quantum, thank you for the five gift issues.

307
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,570
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,890
Um...

309
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,650
Oh, so yes, I walked...

310
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,970
I was actually very surprised today that...

311
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,070
Because like, he didn't poop yesterday.

312
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,170
For Dad, DirtyAmberDoge.

313
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,390
He didn't poop yesterday because like, for like late...

314
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,790
Not like all the whole day yesterday, but like for his like second walk, like his nighttime walks.

315
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,790
Because there was a...

316
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,690
Because he hates the rain.

317
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,750
So like, there was like a...

318
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,630
There was like a rainstorm.

319
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,150
And I even gave him like a little ring.

320
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,930
And I gave him like a little raincoat to wear.

321
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,130
But like, you...

322
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,710
This is why I'm so...

323
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,870
This is why like, I don't know what to do with him when it's raining.

324
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,590
Like, I don't know.

325
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,730
Because he doesn't want to...

326
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,630
He doesn't...

327
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,870
He's like holding it in.

328
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,930
And he holds it in.

329
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,910
And he was like...

330
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,370
He was like, oh man.

331
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,570
Maybe it'll not rain tomorrow.

332
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,830
But like, I can't take that gamble.

333
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,670
I...

334
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,210
I was like...

335
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,090
I was like...

336
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,770
I can't take that gamble of you...

337
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,410
Like...

338
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,310
Thinking tomorrow will be a better day.

339
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,150
Like...

340
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,010
So...

341
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,530
So I'm like, we're both miserable.

342
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,010
I know you want to go home.

343
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,490
I'm miserable that we're walking in the rain.

344
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,050
You're miserable that you're walking in the rain.

345
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,190
But we have to do this.

346
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,370
Because he kept like...

347
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,430
He kept like...

348
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,610
He peed and then he just wants to go back.

349
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,250
He doesn't care.

350
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,310
And then...

351
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,050
And I'm like, no.

352
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,310
We still have to do this.

353
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:08,870
Like...

354
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,710
We still have to do this.

355
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,950
Anyway...

356
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,950
He won yesterday.

357
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,950
So...

358
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,970
Because like today, luckily, the rain stopped.

359
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,870
So like...

360
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,710
He took the gamble.

361
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,330
He took the 50-50 gacha that the rain will stop by tomorrow.

362
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,170
And it did.

363
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,630
So like...

364
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,470
Good for him.

365
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,770
But then...

366
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,790
Okay, when I was walking...

367
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,810
He's such a little shit sometimes.

368
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,130
When I was walking back...

369
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,150
I don't know why.

370
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,230
Somebody left like two pizza crusts on the floor.

371
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,750
Like on the sidewalk.

372
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,950
I didn't know.

373
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,650
Because like usually it's clean.

374
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,490
Usually it's fucking clean.

375
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,630
Um...

376
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,650
So then like...

377
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,890
I was just walking.

378
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,590
And then he's...

379
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,010
And then suddenly he like...

380
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,570
Walked up to like...

381
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,250
A place.

382
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:52,930
He's like...

383
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,670
And I was like...

384
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,150
What the fuck?

385
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,030
I was like...

386
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,210
I was like...

387
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:57,810
What?

388
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,510
What?

389
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:58,890
I was like...

390
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,030
No!

391
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,130
No!

392
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:00,690
Donkey, no!

393
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,290
And then he like spit it out.

394
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,610
But I was just like...

395
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,050
What the fuck?

396
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,450
And then he just...

397
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,330
Casually walked over.

398
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,850
So I didn't like...

399
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,150
Expect it at all.

400
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,470
He like...

401
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,630
Casually like...

402
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,430
Walked over.

403
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,130
Because like...

404
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,570
You know...

405
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,810
If there's food...

406
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,550
Like normal...

407
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,210
Normal dogs.

408
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,790
Normal dogs.

409
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,230
They would like...

410
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,670
You know...

411
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,110
Rush over and eat it.

412
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,970
He...

413
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,930
Fucking just...

414
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,610
Casually walked over.

415
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,310
So I had no suspicion at all.

416
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,730
That there's food on the floor.

417
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,150
Because I was like...

418
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,450
I was...

419
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,950
I was...

420
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,270
I was...

421
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,790
I was so tired.

422
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,570
I was so tired.

423
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,210
So I was not...

424
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,470
Mentally there.

425
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,190
Like...

426
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,670
I was not mentally there.

427
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,330
I was just autopiloting the walk.

428
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,190
Because he already pooped and peed.

429
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,010
So like...

430
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,670
We're just walking back home.

431
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,430
So he played it cool.

432
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,490
And...

433
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:50,710
Yeah.

434
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,370
He knows that if he rushes...

435
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,350
I will stop him.

436
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,150
So I was just like...

437
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,890
It's just the walk back home.

438
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,570
And we're literally like...

439
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,470
Like...

440
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,830
30 steps almost back.

441
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,750
We're like 30...

442
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,110
Like 20 to 30 steps...

443
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,250
Almost back.

444
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,090
Almost back home.

445
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,270
And he's just...

446
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,070
And I saw...

447
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,610
I was like...

448
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:09,910
You know...

449
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,010
That sudden movement freaked me out.

450
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,150
Because I was like...

451
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,730
What the fuck?

452
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,650
I was like...

453
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,690
I saw a giant pizza crust in his mouth.

454
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,430
And I was like...

455
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,190
Donkey, no!

456
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,430
And he just spits it out.

457
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,270
Because he knows.

458
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:22,690
He's like...

459
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,050
Oh shit.

460
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,570
She saw...

461
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:23,890
He saw...

462
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,450
She saw me.

463
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,390
And then we continued the walk.

464
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,190
I was like...

465
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,910
Thank God.

466
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,930
Thank God he spit it out.

467
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,010
Because I was like...

468
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,470
Oh my God.

469
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,390
What the fuck do I do?

470
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,990
I don't want to...

471
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,250
I don't want to...

472
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,570
What the fuck do I do?

473
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,150
So yeah.

474
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,830
He was...

475
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,670
He was definitely a little shit today.

476
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,710
And yesterday as well.

477
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,230
He was...

478
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,750
He was like...

479
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,190
I don't know where he gets it from.

480
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:48,710
I don't...

481
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,470
Clearly not me.

482
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,510
Because I'm so well behaved.

483
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,610
I'm actually getting outplayed by a dog.

484
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,110
Weeding dogs are surprisingly very smart for how tiny they are.

485
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,150
They're actually really fucking smart.

486
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,230
I'm not kidding.

487
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,230
They're way too smart for their own good.

488
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,870
They're way too smart for their own good though.

489
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,470
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

490
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:13,890
Welcome.

491
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,270
Welcome.

492
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,570
All right.

493
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,630
Now we actually play the video game.

494
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,670
Now after the entire life update, we can finally play the video game.

495
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,610
All right.

496
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,390
Let's see.

497
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,050
Let's get that out here.

498
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:27,930
Oh yeah.

499
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,410
What's this?

500
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,650
I need to look up what the sound is that put Wukong in.

501
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,010
Okay.

502
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,230
10.8.

503
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,630
5.

504
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,310
And then Street Fighter is...

505
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,950
I always screenshot the sound and everything so that I would know...

506
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:48,810
So if I'm playing the game again, I will know to put it back at the same volume.

507
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,650
So I don't have to always be like, sound guy, what's the volume?

508
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,110
And everything.

509
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,210
We're finally...

510
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,530
Don't...

511
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,450
Don't fuck with me.

512
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,510
I know there was no stutter.

513
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,370
Don't fuck...

514
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:10,850
Because the stutter only happens visually, not like on stream, like not, not like the voice and everything.

515
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,350
So like, I don't even have the game up yet, guys.

516
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,050
So I know you're fucking with me.

517
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:26,670
I fucking know you're messing with me just because the game hasn't even been up yet.

518
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,330
When you said it was...

519
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:28,810
Also.

520
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,110
Yeah.

521
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:43,090
Like, um, um, I traveled around a little bit, uh, played a little game a little bit because, um, uh, because, uh, we had to test out the game and everything.

522
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,210
So, uh, yeah.

523
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:45,690
Yeah.

524
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,830
You guys are gonna do like the Dragoon who cried wolf.

525
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,790
The Dragoon who cried stutters, like, and then nobody will be happy.

526
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,810
This affects all of us.

527
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,750
This affects your stream experience if you cried stutters.

528
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,010
Sorry, I had to hide it.

529
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,690
All right.

530
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,050
So yeah, I accidentally went into a place that I should not have went to because I didn't know there was going to be a cut scene.

531
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,670
I didn't know it was a new location.

532
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,730
I wanted to see if I could find like an optional boss, but there was no optional bosses to find.

533
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,730
So I accidentally.

534
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,790
Explored an area.

535
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,250
That I should not have explored.

536
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,170
I had to come clean with it.

537
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,950
I had to.

538
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,210
I made a mistake there.

539
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,870
All right.

540
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,640
Play through.

541
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,180
It's not.

542
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,700
It's just one area.

543
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,420
It's literally one area.

544
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,320
Like it doesn't make that much of a difference, guys.

545
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,540
It was one area.

546
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,480
Let me make sure the.

547
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,000
Let me make sure the.

548
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,140
Because I also updated my graphics driver.

549
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,820
And I hate it when you update your graphics driver.

550
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
Like things.

551
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,800
Things go like.

552
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,020
I was so worried.

553
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,740
Like everything resets.

554
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,660
And stuff.

555
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,560
Now.

556
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,700
It was just.

557
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,820
Three cinematic shots.

558
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,960
Of like a location.

559
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
That was it.

560
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,040
That was it.

561
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,700
If I didn't tell you, you guys would not have known.

562
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,220
Because.

563
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,840
But because.

564
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,000
That was it.

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,160
Because.

566
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
I am such a kind.

567
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,600
Oh, she.

568
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,800
And kind.

569
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,680
And transparent.

570
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,460
Oh, she.

571
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,240
I was willing to admit.

572
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,980
That I.

573
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,560
I.

574
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
Explored a little bit too much.

575
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,360
Like.

576
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,240
Three.

577
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,140
That's way too many.

578
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,880
All right.

579
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,860
Oh, shit.

580
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,580
Okay.

581
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,340
And I.

582
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,720
Farmed a little bit of will.

583
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,440
Because I know I need.

584
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,300
Like four million willpower.

585
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,000
Or some shit.

586
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,000
All right.

587
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,980
Was it the village?

588
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,960
It was some fucking.

589
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,980
It was some.

590
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,100
It was like.

591
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,560
This.

592
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,300
Uh.

593
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,020
Temple.

594
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,260
Like a temple.

595
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,400
Uh.

596
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,740
So.

597
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,040
Like.

598
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,560
I don't know.

599
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,140
It was like.

600
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,780
It was that other area.

601
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,520
Where like.

602
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,500
Uh.

603
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,100
I had to go past the bridge.

604
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,660
Or.

605
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,220
Uh.

606
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,980
I had to go past the bridge.

607
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,380
Or.

608
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,960
Not.

609
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,180
And I chose.

610
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,520
And then you guys told me to not go to the bridge.

611
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,580
That was basically.

612
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,020
Yes.

613
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,960
I know we stuttered there.

614
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,180
Like.

615
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,400
I could see the frame drop there.

616
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,600
But.

617
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,220
That's not.

618
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,780
That.

619
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,360
That.

620
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,320
That's just on the game.

621
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,940
Like.

622
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,240
Don't.

623
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,940
Don't say that.

624
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,520
Oh.

625
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:32,900
There's a.

626
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,220
Yes.

627
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,860
I saw the frame.

628
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Guys.

629
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,300
We all saw the frame drop.

630
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,180
We all.

631
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,560
We all saw the frame drop.

632
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,080
All right.

633
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,860
Let's see.

634
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,460
I'm so lost.

635
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,520
Will I ever figure out where to go?

636
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,600
Stream experience.

637
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,260
It's not at 100% CPU.

638
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,940
Guys.

639
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,200
Now.

640
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,880
I actually don't know.

641
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,120
Whenever.

642
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,620
You're at.

643
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Like.

644
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,180
Where to go.

645
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,020
Do I have mods?

646
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,660
Like.

647
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,580
I'm at the point where.

648
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,060
I can't trust anything.

649
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,700
I assume I can trust the mods.

650
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,160
Right?

651
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,820
Like.

652
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,200
Do I have mods on right now?

653
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,400
The CPU is upset.

654
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,100
I am.

655
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm literally monitoring my CPU right now.

656
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,160
I am literally monitoring my CPU.

657
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,460
Holy shit.

658
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:21,780
Dude.

659
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,660
They're not even worth.

660
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,060
They're not even worth killing it gives me 67 Whirl.

661
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,680
I am a money or not.

662
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:28,740
Let's go.

663
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,740
Wow, what happened to your check mark?

664
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,820
Let me give you... what happened to your wrench?

665
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,520
Let me give you a wrench right now.

666
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,160
Wow.

667
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,100
You got me.

668
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,140
You sure fooled me.

669
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,180
You can trust me.

670
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:53,020
That is like a bullshit lie told by fucking grandpas who actually can't see more than 24 frames.

671
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,480
Iridescent, thank you for the super chat.

672
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,280
Thank you, thank you.

673
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,960
We know the human eye cannot see more than... it's 30 frames though.

674
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,160
Oh, this guy was born in 1900s.

675
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,740
In 1930s, it was... it got into 30 frames.

676
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,320
And it never went up from there.

677
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,140
You can't even trust the mods.

678
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,380
Where do I go?

679
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,820
It's just a turtle.

680
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,440
Where the fuck...

681
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,260
Look, if we like can only see...

682
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,800
Only see it at like 30 frames or whatever.

683
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,400
Then like...

684
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,880
Then like...

685
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,780
Why the fuck do we keep making like higher hertz monitors?

686
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,160
Like that's...

687
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,960
It's a conspiracy.

688
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,840
Oh, there he is.

689
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,880
Chewbacca.

690
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,920
Why are you so short?

691
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,680
Leave.

692
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,940
To sell us newer monitors.

693
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,380
It was a conspiracy from the tech bros.

694
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,520
They fooled us all by saying we can actually see in higher FPS.

695
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,200
So that they'll...

696
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,080
So that we'll keep buying more monitors.

697
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,460
That will be a total...

698
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,120
It's a conspiracy from Big Display.

699
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,300
That's why it's called the Illuminati.

700
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,820
Illuminate?

701
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,460
Oh, coincidence.

702
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,120
What the...

703
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,860
Whoa...

704
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,680
Oh...

705
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,900
Yeah, stop crying.

706
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,080
Don't be a little bitch.

707
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,700
You're just a giant turtle.

708
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,920
Quit fucking crying.

709
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,100
Oh, wait.

710
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,120
Okay, nice.

711
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,140
Alright.

712
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,960
Light the incense.

713
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,350
I still can't believe they haven't even... they haven't fixed the subtitles thing.

714
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,570
The accessibility on the subtitles.

715
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,290
It's been so long.

716
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,630
I would think they would hotfix because that's literally my only complaint.

717
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,450
Out of everything about this game, my only complaint is subtitles too tiny.

718
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,190
The turtle was a Dota player.

719
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,750
That's why he was crying.

720
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,530
That's why he was crying.

721
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,290
Let's see.

722
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,510
Oh shit, what?

723
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,310
Pig, do the thing.

724
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,410
Oh, what the fuck did he throw up?

725
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,590
That's fucked.

726
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,350
Okay, that's also fucked.

727
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,450
What are you throwing?

728
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,410
What did you eat?

729
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,810
You're too tiny.

730
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,310
Are you bulimic?

731
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,150
Oh my god, please love yourself.

732
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,210
Oh hey, it's that guy again.

733
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,810
His tumor head.

734
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,570
Alright, this guy willing to use magic.

735
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,710
He's actually really frustrating to fight against.

736
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,110
Big baby.

737
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,150
Doki hates Dota confirmed.

738
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,570
I don't hate it.

739
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,570
I just don't care.

740
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,890
What's worse than hate?

741
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,610
Like, what's it called?

742
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,530
What's the word for like not caring?

743
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,550
That's what's worse.

744
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,170
Ambulance or whatever.

745
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,190
It's not my fault you're tiny.

746
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:46,930
You're tiny.

747
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,350
Tiny legs.

748
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,510
Apathy, yeah.

749
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,170
Indifference, yeah.

750
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,000
The worst... the thing worse than hate is just indifference.

751
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,300
Wait, another incense already?

752
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,360
Where the fuck am I?

753
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,660
Is there another... I literally just got here.

754
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,240
Alright, I guess... I guess I like the incense.

755
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,580
Oh, go back and go up or down.

756
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,600
Okay, I like how you're like...

757
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,220
By the way, it could be up.

758
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,020
It could be down.

759
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,780
But like, there's a boss there.

760
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,020
That... thank you.

761
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,500
That really helped when it came the direction.

762
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,060
Okay.

763
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,580
I accidentally pressed R.

764
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,580
Was it an advice or a riddle?

765
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,820
Let's find out.

766
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,780
How did I miss this?

767
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,200
It was literally right in front of me.

768
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,220
Alright, it's either up or down.

769
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,740
At least it's not left or right.

770
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,680
If you add it in any more directions, I definitely will get lost.

771
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,060
Alright, let's see.

772
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,200
Travel, new west...

773
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,000
There you go.

774
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm just too lazy to... to figure this out.

775
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,470
I don't want to travel.

776
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,650
I don't want to walk back.

777
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,110
Why walk back when I can like... fast pass?

778
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,410
Alright.

779
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:32,950
Up.

780
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,390
Okay, it's either down or it's either up.

781
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,550
So we'll go down first.

782
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,130
How much does he give?

783
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,530
I want to know.

784
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,490
How much willpower?

785
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,930
Okay, 86 is not...

786
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,890
Oh, fuck!

787
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,190
Okay.

788
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,230
Okay, I literally just wasted a little bit of my HP for the boss fight.

789
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,710
Do I get XP if...

790
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,610
If Pigsy kills him?

791
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,270
I do.

792
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,490
Okay, that's good.

793
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,950
Alright, that's the beach, right?

794
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,630
Is that the beach?

795
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,830
Is that the one with the dinos?

796
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,550
Oh, is that another dragon that fostered over there?

797
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,150
Oh, is that him?

798
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,930
Are you bad?

799
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,690
He looks bad.

800
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,030
Oh no, he's not.

801
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,170
He's just a regular guy.

802
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,330
He's just...

803
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,790
He's just a regular guy.

804
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,310
He's like, I was just enjoying the scenery.

805
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,710
And I came in with a giant baby.

806
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,650
He's just a dude.

807
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,490
He's just like, oh man, I can't wait to go on my regular...

808
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,250
On my regular beach walk.

809
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,070
And then...

810
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,110
And then I came over there and shanked him like I was in London.

811
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,570
Like the shank drive-by.

812
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,350
I was like, no walks for you.

813
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,310
You're trying to enjoy your day?

814
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,970
How dare you?

815
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,550
This is Wukong territory.

816
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,490
I mean, I am a little shit.

817
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:07,950
I am...

818
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,150
Alright, let's see.

819
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,110
Wait, it disappeared.

820
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,450
Did I already got it?

821
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,850
I must have already got it somehow.

822
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,770
Oi, mate.

823
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,410
I'm trying to enjoy lovely...

824
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,490
Fucking English.

825
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,290
You're trying to enjoy lovely school on beach, eh?

826
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,690
No walks for you.

827
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,710
Okay.

828
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,570
Oh no, I don't have the thing.

829
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,430
I stuttered IRL.

830
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,690
I had an IRL stutter.

831
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,510
Where the fuck is this boss?

832
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,690
The Wukong clan is here.

833
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,850
I mean, he did have one.

834
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,890
They just all died.

835
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,010
Apparently, the fucking gods killed most of them.

836
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,290
Because they hate the monkeys.

837
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,250
Which is pretty fucked up.

838
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,490
Oh, the snake gen...

839
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,010
Is this up?

840
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,430
Is this the up part?

841
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,590
Or do we go follow the bones?

842
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,130
Oh, we follow the broke bones.

843
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,750
This is a giant ass snake.

844
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,090
It could be like a legless reptile.

845
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,470
A legless lizard.

846
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Oh, it's him.

847
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,780
But bigger.

848
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,280
Oh, I think he found out about my London shanks.

849
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,540
I think he found out.

850
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,620
He's like, you've been shanking my kids.

851
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,120
Like, no, man.

852
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,200
Oh, no.

853
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,940
She found out.

854
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,020
She found...

855
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,940
How did I miss?

856
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,860
How do I always manage to miss?

857
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,720
I don't understand.

858
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,380
Okay.

859
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,500
Oh.

860
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,500
Oh.

861
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,640
All right.

862
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,280
Oh, shit.

863
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,840
Okay, nice.

864
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,100
Nice.

865
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,500
He's killed.

866
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,280
Nice.

867
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,280
The piggy is a distraction.

868
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,920
I can't see.

869
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,740
But nice.

870
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,100
Oh, shit.

871
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,240
Okay.

872
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,560
All right.

873
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:21,920
Here we go.

874
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,540
Yeah.

875
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,100
That's right.

876
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,200
Use my spells early.

877
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,980
I'm getting as much damage as I can.

878
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,620
But I should...

879
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,820
Is he here forever?

880
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,600
Wait.

881
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,760
Is he going to fight for me forever?

882
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,960
He's great bait.

883
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,520
Like, aggro.

884
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,920
The fact that he can aggro him for me is really good.

885
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,760
All right.

886
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,060
No.

887
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,400
Okay.

888
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:43,940
Never mind.

889
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,520
Never mind.

890
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,100
He's not aggroing anymore because he fucking hates me, I guess.

891
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,800
All right.

892
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,360
No.

893
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:48,720
Okay.

894
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,040
Never mind.

895
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,900
All right.

896
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,080
I need to make sure not to...

897
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,680
Oh, shit.

898
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,000
Okay.

899
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,740
Nice.

900
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,280
I had to make sure I don't accidentally...

901
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,760
I told you guys.

902
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,700
It's character development.

903
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
Are you fucking...

904
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,760
Okay.

905
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,760
Oh, shit.

906
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,600
Wait.

907
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,200
I'm chilled.

908
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,340
Chewbacca, help me.

909
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,560
Oh, wait.

910
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,380
Okay.

911
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,300
Look at the way he fucking...

912
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,140
He fucking...

913
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,800
Wait.

914
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,680
He hurt me.

915
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,740
He hurt...

916
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,060
Oh, shit.

917
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,340
Oh my God.

918
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,900
They're listening.

919
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,840
He has access to my microphone.

920
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,560
Oh my God.

921
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,780
Wukong has access to my microphone.

922
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,660
He actually waddled over.

923
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,440
Okay.

924
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,680
I did not expect.

925
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,580
That's pretty good.

926
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,260
He's watching...

927
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,200
He's stream sniping.

928
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,460
They got the spyware.

929
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,060
Oh, my God.

930
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,180
Every copy of Wukong is personalised.

931
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,360
Alright.

932
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,060
Can't be a phase 2.

933
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,500
Oh, she just leaves.

934
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,560
She's like, you can take the children.

935
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,280
You can take the kids.

936
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,580
No, I wanted to read the lore!

937
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,680
Read.

938
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,180
Dwelling in a Buddha's form, when wings to ride the windstorm.

939
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,520
An iron heart through toils and spins.

940
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,240
A golden shell in splendour.

941
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,000
Alright, nice.

942
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,980
Alright.

943
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,220
Nice, we did it!

944
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,060
You reading.

945
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,080
I'm a speed reader.

946
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,240
Did you guys know that?

947
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,740
How can a speed read?

948
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,420
I never said if I'm good at it though.

949
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,120
Hahaha!

950
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,320
Being able to speed read doesn't mean I'm good at speed reading.

951
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,340
It's just that, like, I can do it.

952
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,620
Oh?

953
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,580
What's he doing?

954
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,050
What's he doing?

955
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,770
Oh no, is that his, like, wife?

956
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,670
His tears are of great use.

957
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,770
This is his answer.

958
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,970
Oh my god, wait, is that his wife?

959
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,290
Is that why he's crying?

960
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,510
His wife's dead.

961
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,690
Some kids say they were roommates.

962
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,970
Oh no, your very close roommate died.

963
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:45,910
His.

964
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,250
Hahaha.

965
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,990
Okay, let's see.

966
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,470
They never married, it's so weird.

967
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:56,370
Hahaha.

968
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,290
And they, like, shared one bedroom.

969
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,170
Like, I don't know, I was like, man, rent must be, like, really expensive, you know?

970
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,350
Hahaha.

971
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,770
They had to share one bedroom together.

972
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,010
My god.

973
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,410
What really good friends they were.

974
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:19,890
Turtle loot?

975
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,670
Yeah, I'm going back to the turtle loot.

976
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,050
Hahaha.

977
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,530
Yeah, I'm going to the tears.

978
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,350
I assume, whoops, that's not what I wanted to do.

979
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,710
Where did you cry, turtle man?

980
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,050
Wait, where did he cry?

981
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,970
There were...

982
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,070
Oh, it seems they were saving on...

983
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,570
They even, like, shared clothes sometimes.

984
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:46,930
My god.

985
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:50,090
Living in Canada must be really rough now.

986
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:50,650
Hahaha.

987
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,590
They shared a lot.

988
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,190
It was next to the stairs!

989
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,050
I don't know, I literally looked at the cutscene and, like, the cutscene was like...

990
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,910
Like, he was crying near...

991
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,970
How did your tears go this far?

992
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,470
How did...

993
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,890
His tears dropped into the sea.

994
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,750
Like, how am I supposed to fight his tears?

995
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,630
Hahaha.

996
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,050
Okay.

997
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,150
It's not...

998
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,150
I am...

999
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,870
Okay, now I'm...

1000
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,570
Not only am I getting gaslit regarding studies.

1001
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,330
I'm getting gaslit on where he fucking cried.

1002
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,110
Like, they lied.

1003
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,090
Where did you cry?

1004
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,930
How am I supposed to fight tears and water?

1005
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,350
Wouldn't that be, like...

1006
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,190
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose?

1007
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,810
Oh, there it is.

1008
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,990
It's not even in the water.

1009
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:42,610
Oh my god.

1010
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,990
Alright, what is this?

1011
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:46,990
Turtle tears.

1012
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,830
Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking drink tur...

1013
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:49,390
That's hardcore.

1014
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,850
That's actually hardcore.

1015
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,270
Alright, where's the turtle tears?

1016
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,170
Oh, I have to do...

1017
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,070
Oh, I have to do it in the...

1018
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:00,510
Um...

1019
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,790
That's...

1020
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,410
Oh, okay.

1021
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,010
Yeah, I have to do it in the, uh, incense area.

1022
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,250
I also have new items.

1023
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,390
I don't even know which...

1024
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:09,850
Oh, this one.

1025
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,230
Okay.

1026
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,410
Reduces...

1027
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,830
Increases stamina recovery rate.

1028
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,030
Uh, grants reduction when Gord is...

1029
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,010
Okay, we already have that.

1030
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,210
Increases...

1031
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,170
In chilled state.

1032
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,710
Moderately...

1033
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,470
We don't need it.

1034
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,930
We don't need chill resistance.

1035
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,970
Bash my head against the wall until it works.

1036
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,790
The Doki way.

1037
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,130
Alright, now where do we go?

1038
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:37,950
Where do we go now?

1039
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,890
Do we go back to the tunnel?

1040
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,810
Oh, further down?

1041
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,030
Alright.

1042
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,530
Chewbacca, you can deal with this.

1043
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,110
Okay, you're not that...

1044
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,010
You're not that important to me.

1045
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,310
You're so not important that, like, I don't...

1046
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:53,690
I missed.

1047
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,170
But you're still not that important.

1048
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,230
There's a boss near the turtle?

1049
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,110
This way?

1050
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,430
There's a...

1051
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,470
There's a water boss?

1052
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,430
West.

1053
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,230
Which one's west?

1054
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,150
Fuck, okay.

1055
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,430
North is up.

1056
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,650
North is up.

1057
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,110
South is down.

1058
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,290
West is left.

1059
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,310
West is left because I live in the west coast.

1060
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:22,870
So, like...

1061
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,250
Wait, is west left?

1062
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:26,270
Are we on the left side?

1063
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,010
Yes, we are.

1064
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,050
We're on the left side.

1065
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:32,910
That's...

1066
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,470
That's how I do...

1067
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,450
I know where west is because I'm on the west coast.

1068
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,510
That's how I can...

1069
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,990
Everybody knows I'm on the west coast.

1070
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,850
I always say west coast, best coast.

1071
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,450
Is that him?

1072
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,550
Oh, wait, why is he using electricity and water?

1073
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,990
Isn't that bad?

1074
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,310
Are you friend?

1075
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,150
Okay, he is not friend.

1076
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,670
Oh, oh, I...

1077
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,390
Okay, I have zero mana.

1078
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,370
All right, this is a little awkward.

1079
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,130
This is...

1080
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:10,910
Zero mana.

1081
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,890
Well, I did say I was gonna kill all the dragons in this world.

1082
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,510
This is why we don't have dragons anymore.

1083
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,090
In the modern world.

1084
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,390
We kill them all.

1085
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,230
Just like the dinosaurs.

1086
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:29,370
You think humans didn't exist during the age of the dinosaurs?

1087
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,710
That's what we told children.

1088
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,890
To fool them.

1089
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,010
To trick them.

1090
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,890
But we existed during the prehistoric dino times too.

1091
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,610
All right, nice.

1092
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,280
All right.

1093
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,620
The meteors.

1094
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,780
The Illuminati.

1095
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,860
Invented the whole meteor shit.

1096
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,340
All right.

1097
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,280
We got it.

1098
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,400
Oh my god, please.

1099
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,160
Oh, I have transform.

1100
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,760
I have transform.

1101
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,600
Forgot about transform.

1102
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,960
Let's see.

1103
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,280
All right, come on, this way.

1104
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,560
What the fuck?

1105
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,480
Let me kill you.

1106
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,020
Illuminati summons the meteor.

1107
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,020
No, it was Stanley Kubrick.

1108
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,880
He did that as a favor.

1109
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,180
After the moon...

1110
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,080
After faking the moon landing, we drilled a hole in...

1111
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,840
On the earth.

1112
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,140
Oh my god.

1113
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,480
A hole in the earth.

1114
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,820
That is...

1115
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,800
That...

1116
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,880
Books about dinosaurs only existed during the 1960s.

1117
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,580
Kubrick strikes again.

1118
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,200
All right.

1119
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,720
Oh, shit.

1120
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,980
Nice, easy.

1121
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,840
Why is this all coming together?

1122
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,680
We agreed to let some...

1123
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,560
Let him fake that.

1124
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,940
Oh, he wants to be immortal?

1125
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:24,390
What is he whining about?

1126
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,050
He's already a dragon.

1127
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,510
Maybe if you take off all your clothes, you wouldn't age that badly.

1128
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,050
Are you doing phase two?

1129
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:42,570
Oh, wait, no.

1130
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,310
He's just...

1131
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:44,830
He's just mad.

1132
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,190
Did I beat up an old man?

1133
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,610
Why do all the dragons not wear clothes except...

1134
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:49,970
Oh, no, no.

1135
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,530
We did fight some dragons with clothes.

1136
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,850
I was gonna say, why do some dragons wear clothes and some do not?

1137
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,390
Like...

1138
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,730
Like that lady dragon didn't wear clothes.

1139
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,930
We literally beat up an old man.

1140
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:04,410
I'm sorry.

1141
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,830
So sorry.

1142
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:10,750
Hey.

1143
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,610
Oh, the dog guy is here, too?

1144
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,900
Oh, my God.

1145
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,560
I'm so...

1146
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,320
Now I feel bad.

1147
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Marina, thank you for the super chat.

1148
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,140
Thank you, thank you.

1149
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,760
I don't speak Cantonese, so when you say his name fast, I just hear Chewbacca.

1150
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,000
But it's not even right.

1151
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,760
Oh, man.

1152
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,720
I'm sorry.

1153
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,820
You just...

1154
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,740
I mean, like, you clearly hit me first.

1155
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,980
I thought you were a friend.

1156
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,980
I thought you were a friend.

1157
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,340
I'm sorry, man.

1158
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,720
You straight out... This was self-defense.

1159
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,720
Like, yeah, I fucking punched the grandpa, but like...

1160
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,680
Okay, if, like... Okay, if, like, some 80-year-old grandpa runs at you...

1161
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,580
Like, about to hit you with his fist...

1162
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,020
Like, you'd punch back, right?

1163
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,040
Like, you'd fucking... You wouldn't let him just punch you.

1164
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,920
You'd hit him back, right, guys?

1165
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,500
Like, it may... Is that fucked up?

1166
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:32,900
Is that...

1167
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,120
Like, I don't want to get hit.

1168
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:37,860
Like...

1169
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,620
Like...

1170
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,700
Like...

1171
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,920
I don't want to initiate shit.

1172
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,980
Literally, I was, like, friend, and then he tried to...

1173
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,360
He tried to, like, electric shock me.

1174
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,060
And then I had to teach an old man a lesson.

1175
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,590
All I'm saying is that...

1176
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,270
Self-defense, no matter what age.

1177
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,170
I would... If a child runs at me trying to punch me, I will push him.

1178
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,010
Because then... Because here's my reasoning.

1179
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,030
Like, the child would think if I don't push him...

1180
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:23,570
The child would think that, like, he has the right to, like, do whatever the fuck he wants.

1181
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,030
And then he'll become, like, super spoiled.

1182
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,530
He would become super spoiled if I don't push him.

1183
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,910
I won't punch him.

1184
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,250
Because, like, I have, like, a bit of morality.

1185
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,890
But, like, I'll push him.

1186
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,070
Like, I'll push him to the floor and be like, what the fuck are you doing?

1187
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,510
Hey.

1188
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,110
Hey.

1189
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,530
Boom.

1190
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,090
Why can't he just do everything for me?

1191
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:53,610
Oh, shit.

1192
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:54,610
Oh, shit.

1193
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,110
All right.

1194
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,390
Like, I do have some...

1195
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:03,010
Also, children are fucked because they don't have, like, any sense of, like, right and wrong.

1196
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,950
So, like, I am here to teach him what is right and what is wrong.

1197
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:07,630
Like...

1198
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,810
I will...

1199
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,990
I will take the hard...

1200
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:16,690
I will take the hard job of teaching him what is right and what is wrong.

1201
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:19,610
Exactly.

1202
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,050
Hands rated E for everybody.

1203
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,410
Oh, I don't have...

1204
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,450
I don't have Healers.

1205
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,650
It's okay.

1206
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,450
He's not gonna do anything to me.

1207
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,410
All right.

1208
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,010
Last guy.

1209
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:37,990
Get over here.

1210
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,010
Oh, my God.

1211
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,730
Nice.

1212
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,990
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1213
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:43,510
Oh, no.

1214
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:44,750
Oh, I was actually...

1215
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,010
What?

1216
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:48,630
All right.

1217
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:49,090
Nice.

1218
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:53,720
Hello.

1219
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,660
Oh, I don't know.

1220
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,700
I'm just here for bananas.

1221
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,700
Registered babysitter.

1222
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,860
By the way.

1223
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:07,780
Fuck.

1224
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1225
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,740
Thank you.

1226
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,360
Oh, treasure?

1227
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,380
What is it?

1228
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:14,600
Okay.

1229
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,700
Thank you for spitting on my face.

1230
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,080
Okay.

1231
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,580
Is this like a Finnish thing?

1232
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:25,800
Okay.

1233
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,920
Is this a Buddhist place?

1234
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,440
I'm trying to listen to this man and buy his treasure.

1235
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,660
A boar's alive.

1236
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,900
Okay.

1237
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,700
We have to figure out why there's fucking monsters everywhere in the Buddha realm.

1238
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,800
Yeah, that's zhupaka.

1239
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,540
He's so tiny.

1240
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,020
I know.

1241
00:54:59,060 --> 00:54:59,720
He's so tiny.

1242
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,340
I've never seen him this tiny before.

1243
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,840
Is it because he's old?

1244
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,360
Like, do they get smaller with age?

1245
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,420
Like, he's like a little teapot.

1246
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:08,820
Teapot pig.

1247
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:45,040
Oh, I love it when like teapot pigs were a thing, but like And like people like because teapot pigs got super popular on social media and tik-tok So people were buying like those miniature it pigs and stuff But then like there were scammers out there that like just gave them regular baby pigs and then they grew up to be like those John ass like 200 pound pigs They're like I think my miniature pig is broken like HAHAHAHAHA They're like guys I thought this is supposed to be a miniature.

1248
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,820
Yeah pigs grow up.

1249
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,200
Just a normal pig

1250
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,340
And they send them to the farm What's this?

1251
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,920
Where are the fucking incense?

1252
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,580
Oh am I medi- is this meditation?

1253
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,880
Oh, no.

1254
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,040
I'm just stealing.

1255
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,960
Alright, I mean the same thing like Stealing is my meditation

1256
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,100
Yeah, but warthogs are not that tiny too.

1257
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,020
There's big-ass warthogs

1258
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,240
There's loot for this area I'm looking

1259
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:39,570
There's like so many like crevices and like areas that you're not even supposed to explore But like they're like bait areas to me

1260
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,260
Okay, maybe this way can I go through here?

1261
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,780
No, that's just aesthetic.

1262
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,380
Oh God am I stuck?

1263
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,400
No, no, please Please.

1264
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,580
Because of exploration.

1265
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,420
It just baits me on where loot should be.

1266
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,040
Is there any more loot here?

1267
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,280
I guess we go this way.

1268
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,440
I didn't go this way yet.

1269
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,160
Okay, we gotta kill this guy.

1270
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,380
Charge it up!

1271
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,680
Charge it up!

1272
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,860
There we go.

1273
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,960
Just wanna make sure he's dead dead.

1274
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,420
Alright, charge it up!

1275
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:23,980
Okay, good.

1276
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,780
He's getting involved.

1277
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,360
Nice.

1278
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,900
Oh shit, you're getting involved too!

1279
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,520
Alright, nice.

1280
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,600
Just wanna clear the path in case anything happens.

1281
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,960
It's cause he's not actually...

1282
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,680
Shroom Hong.

1283
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,260
It's not actually him.

1284
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,680
It's not him him, but I think it's him.

1285
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,800
Like, so I think it's him.

1286
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,380
Like, he's a clone or some shit.

1287
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,740
But like... Oh my god, I have not been upgrading.

1288
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,280
But he doesn't know it yet.

1289
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,080
Uh...

1290
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,680
Okay, I like the... You know what?

1291
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:07,900
Yeah.

1292
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,840
Uh... Oh, attack.

1293
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,320
That's what I like to see.

1294
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,120
I think it's him, but like, he doesn't know it yet.

1295
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,860
Cause like, he's supposed to be the destined one.

1296
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,280
So like...

1297
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,020
And like, he already looks like...

1298
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,160
And everybody was saying that he looks like him.

1299
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,200
So I think he's like one of the clones or something.

1300
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,000
Yeah.

1301
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,280
I'm just thinking he's like one of the clones.

1302
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,540
But it's not actually him him.

1303
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,840
Cause we're like... The mission started being like, We gotta free him!

1304
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,390
Oh, talk to beach dragon?

1305
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,150
Talk to the grandpa?

1306
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,490
Alright, I'm heading over.

1307
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:53,690
Gramps!

1308
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:56,690
Gramps!

1309
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,690
Also like, I know I started this stream like...

1310
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,690
Early, like at 12.30.

1311
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,470
But I might not be... I might do not do a very long stream today.

1312
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,150
Uh...

1313
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,590
It's cause I have a lot of errands to run later.

1314
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,770
Hello grandpa!

1315
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,130
Oh, he says the same thing.

1316
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,690
He says the same thing.

1317
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:32,550
Liars!

1318
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,190
I thought it would be something new.

1319
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,870
Go back to the dog?

1320
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:41,110
Where does he live?

1321
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,630
Cause you can't just say go back to the dog.

1322
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,090
I don't know where the dog lives!

1323
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,170
We haven't even met him!

1324
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,190
Oh!

1325
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,990
I thought he traveled here!

1326
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,030
Oh!

1327
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:00,190
You mean he didn't go to the mountains?

1328
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,450
You have to go back to him?

1329
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,230
Why can't he travel with me?

1330
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,030
You know like the merchants?

1331
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:11,550
That would travel with you always no matter where you go?

1332
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:12,510
Like...

1333
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:14,730
Why can't he come here?

1334
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,010
Why do I have to go to him?

1335
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,330
Alright, here we go.

1336
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,770
Oh yeah, I forgot about Hong Kong Monkey.

1337
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,430
He's been there for a while.

1338
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:33,930
He's been there for a while.

1339
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:34,630
He's been there for a while.

1340
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:34,670
Okay.

1341
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:36,550
Maximum health.

1342
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,190
The older the one.

1343
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,550
Okay, each sip requires three moderate increases.

1344
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,570
I like the 40%.

1345
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:44,170
That's because it's a bigger number.

1346
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,610
When at full health, using the gourd recovers a moderate amount of mana.

1347
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:50,090
Oh!

1348
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,950
I feel like...

1349
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,950
Okay, that doesn't matter because it's so rare to be full health.

1350
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:04,030
Like whenever I'm fighting the bosses, I'm already going to be full health anyway.

1351
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,650
So it doesn't really matter.

1352
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,090
Is that you?

1353
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:10,750
There you are.

1354
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:11,550
That's you.

1355
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,930
Oh, it gives three slots?

1356
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:17,270
Oh!

1357
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:21,870
Guys, I did tell you I'm a speed reader.

1358
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:22,990
Not a very good one.

1359
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,450
Alright, I'm ready.

1360
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,880
Alright, here we go.

1361
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:46,600
Brew.

1362
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,980
What's this?

1363
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,360
Oh, there it is.

1364
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,000
Oh!

1365
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,360
Oh!

1366
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,020
Oh my god!

1367
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Wait, what did I use before?

1368
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,180
Okay, the lora beats.

1369
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:04,920
Oh!

1370
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,980
That's so good.

1371
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,210
Okay, nice.

1372
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,230
I can read now.

1373
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,430
Guys, I don't think I'm very good at speed reading.

1374
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,590
But I'm not sure yet.

1375
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,930
I need more data.

1376
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,010
Am I supposed to buy something for him?

1377
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,180
Am I supposed to...

1378
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,460
talk?

1379
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,220
Oh, there he is!

1380
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,080
Sorry.

1381
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,140
I'm still speed reading.

1382
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,520
Oh, there he is.

1383
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,840
He's still doing it.

1384
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,360
I didn't know that.

1385
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,160
Am I supposed to buy them?

1386
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:08,560
Alright.

1387
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,900
Alright, special made bone strengthening pellet.

1388
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,980
Oh yeah.

1389
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,060
I need to make my mind cores.

1390
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,460
Celestial medicine.

1391
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,580
Alright guys, I have nine!

1392
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,860
Wait, no I don't, I have eleven.

1393
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,400
Oh, I have more!

1394
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,580
Alright guys, what did we get?

1395
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,360
Okay.

1396
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,740
Stamina, Recovery, Defense, Stamina, Mana, or Health?

1397
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,220
HP, Health?

1398
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,320
Okay, we'll do HP and...

1399
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,680
Okay, that's two.

1400
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,700
HP and Mana.

1401
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,220
Okay, we'll do Mana first.

1402
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,560
I'll do two Mana.

1403
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,180
Oh god, where's the skip button?

1404
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,860
Oh thank god, okay.

1405
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:50,740
We'll do two?

1406
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,700
And then...

1407
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,600
What else should we do?

1408
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,580
We still have... Oh, nice.

1409
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,160
Alright, HP...

1410
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,700
Stamina, Defense, or Recovery Rate?

1411
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,500
HP and Defense?

1412
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,680
Okay, we'll grab Defense then.

1413
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,360
I'll do one Defense.

1414
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,500
And then we'll do HP.

1415
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,020
I'm mad at who needs HP.

1416
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,460
I don't think this person played this game yet.

1417
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,720
And then we'll put it on HP.

1418
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,140
Okay, we're good.

1419
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,600
Just dodge perfectly every time.

1420
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,760
Just don't get hit.

1421
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,560
Alright, time to talk to the Gramps.

1422
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,480
Dragon Gramps.

1423
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,040
Alright, Travel.

1424
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:07,820
What?

1425
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,480
Why do I have an opportunity to make medicine?

1426
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,800
You know I'm not going to use it.

1427
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,220
Alright, let's see.

1428
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:16,760
There he is.

1429
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,790
Alright.

1430
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,730
We got you the medicine.

1431
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:27,970
Your insurance kicked in.

1432
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,550
Thank God.

1433
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,580
Thank God, Grandpa Dragon.

1434
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,140
Your insurance finally kicked in.

1435
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,810
Alright.

1436
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:44,090
Where is he?

1437
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,610
Wait, where is he?

1438
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,030
Why is he not in the water?

1439
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,450
Oh, he's finally out of the water.

1440
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:51,450
Are you done?

1441
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:52,770
Are you done with your...

1442
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,650
Are you done with your...

1443
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,810
Are you done with your mid-life crisis?

1444
01:05:59,250 --> 01:05:59,770
Grandpa?

1445
01:05:59,770 --> 01:05:59,970
Grandpa?

1446
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,510
This is when I can finally make you extinct?

1447
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:06,110
Look, I did say I was going to kill all the dragons.

1448
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,490
I'm not making any exceptions.

1449
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:08,970
Not even for you, Grandpa.

1450
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,110
I mean at this point, like your time's come.

1451
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:16,690
What?

1452
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,710
He can now´s just!

1453
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:22,290
He just threw it away.

1454
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:26,090
And now I have an innovative secret weapon.

1455
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:32,970
The Punitive Realm?

1456
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:39,910
Bro, you didn't even... what?

1457
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:40,870
Where did he go?

1458
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,110
Wait, what?

1459
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,010
You didn't eat it.

1460
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,750
So, the title is Clickbait.

1461
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:53,410
I wanted to kill him!

1462
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,630
Like, it's the thought that counts.

1463
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:02,650
It's not like I didn't want to.

1464
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,610
Alright, what's this?

1465
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,150
New area?

1466
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,830
A painted world.

1467
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,010
Oh my god, it's like Chalk Zone.

1468
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,670
No, it's not like Chalk Zone.

1469
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,230
It's just a regular world.

1470
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,470
There's a main hub?

1471
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,000
What the fuck?

1472
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,960
Where did I get here?

1473
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,340
Oh, is this where everybody will hang out?

1474
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,320
You want to come back here?

1475
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,080
Why?

1476
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,120
You don't like being in the fucking desert?

1477
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,460
What's wrong with the desert?

1478
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:08,820
What's wrong with the desert?

1479
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,040
Request medicine.

1480
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,080
Oh, is he giving you free stuff?

1481
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,900
Wait, is the Hong Kong monkey?

1482
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,780
Are they all roommates?

1483
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,580
They're sad and it gets everywhere.

1484
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,060
Oh my god, please.

1485
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,380
Why is it not just like matching E?

1486
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,250
Oh my god, they're all roommates.

1487
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,270
Oh, there he is!

1488
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,600
Alright, what is this?

1489
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,000
Oh, upgrade!

1490
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:53,420
Nice.

1491
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,460
Nice, we got the gourd.

1492
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,240
Honestly, I just want to listen to English just for his British accent.

1493
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,300
Hahaha!

1494
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:10,220
Recovers a considerable amount of health for your nearby duplicates upon using the gourd.

1495
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,920
Oh, but it only has like one slot, right?

1496
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,740
Oh yeah, it does.

1497
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,120
Okay.

1498
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,060
Upgrade!

1499
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,300
Okay, already upgraded.

1500
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,080
Uh...

1501
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,900
Hehehe.

1502
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,000
Hehehehe.

1503
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,380
Hehehehe.

1504
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:25,980
Hehehehe.

1505
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,480
Hehehehe.

1506
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,480
Hehehehe.

1507
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,420
Hehehehe.

1508
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,320
Oh, you're friends with all of them?

1509
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,760
Wait, you're all roommates?

1510
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,480
How did you guys all meet?

1511
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,460
How the fuck did you guys all meet?

1512
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,760
Oh, I can like... wait, is this the...

1513
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,560
This is the gourd update.

1514
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,420
Guys, I can't because I need to save up for my weapon upgrade.

1515
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,120
Like, I'm like 20,000 away.

1516
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,500
I'm 20,000 away from the next update.

1517
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,640
Apparently, I can grow plants now.

1518
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,360
Oh, there you are!

1519
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,750
Wait, you're all gods?

1520
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,690
Oh, they're based on the Zodiac!

1521
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:35,210
I know they said Zodiac...

1522
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,450
Sorry, I...

1523
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:41,350
But like, I didn't realize it was based on Zodiac after he said it.

1524
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,690
But like, five seconds later.

1525
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,820
Yeah, sure.

1526
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,240
Just have all the seeds.

1527
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,660
Can I just harvest them now?

1528
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,500
Oh no, okay.

1529
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,140
That's why there's...

1530
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,860
Monkey, dragon, and dog.

1531
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,060
Wait, will there be more deities?

1532
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,740
Or is it just three guys?

1533
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,440
What's this?

1534
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,460
Wait, who's this guy?

1535
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,860
But he's new.

1536
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,700
Who's he?

1537
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,300
I've never met him before.

1538
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,560
I've never met him before.

1539
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,080
I've never met him before.

1540
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,200
The Prime Roommate.

1541
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,900
Like, who is he?

1542
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:45,140
Craft weapons?

1543
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,070
Yeah, I can.

1544
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,770
It's like halfway there for this one.

1545
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:55,330
Wait, what's this?

1546
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:56,730
66?

1547
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,370
Nope.

1548
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:58,450
Nope.

1549
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:03,050
Wait, he doesn't actually craft anything for me.

1550
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,170
I'll challenge him soon, guys.

1551
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,030
I'm just trying to figure out...

1552
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,390
No, nothing...

1553
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:13,090
I don't need to upgrade anything, technically.

1554
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:16,990
Upgrade...

1555
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:17,130
Oh!

1556
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:20,450
Oh!

1557
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,870
I feel like I never have to upgrade my armor.

1558
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:27,090
Because like, I always find better armor in the end.

1559
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:27,590
Alright, challenge.

1560
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,420
Yeah, but I'm a monkey.

1561
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,400
Nice cat hurt monkeys.

1562
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,680
Mommy and Daddy said my skin is bulletproof.

1563
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:54,660
Wait.

1564
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:56,800
That doesn't...

1565
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1566
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,270
Oh, okay.

1567
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:04,170
That's awkward.

1568
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,250
Guys, I forgot.

1569
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,030
Bullets doesn't mean knife.

1570
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,690
That may be bulletproof.

1571
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,350
But I still have to deal with knife.

1572
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,190
Jesus Christ.

1573
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,070
Oh, what is this?

1574
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,390
Holy sh...

1575
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:29,430
Okay, give me a sec.

1576
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:30,610
I'm gonna turn now.

1577
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:33,890
I'm dropping hella frames right now.

1578
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,190
It's a visual...

1579
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,810
Okay, let's put that on low.

1580
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,410
Let's put that on...

1581
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:45,010
That's way too many effects.

1582
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:48,610
That's way too many effects.

1583
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:50,990
Alright, we're fine.

1584
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:51,790
Oh my God.

1585
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,850
It's so much better.

1586
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,170
No, I gotta lie.

1587
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,970
I can just get willpower from that.

1588
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,590
Jesus.

1589
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,030
Jesus Christ.

1590
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:03,410
What?

1591
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:04,650
Did I die?

1592
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:06,030
I died?

1593
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,930
That was such a...

1594
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:18,870
That was so strong.

1595
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:19,750
What's the...

1596
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,890
Oh, it's my zoom in.

1597
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,810
Because we can't make the subtitles bigger.

1598
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:23,310
Okay.

1599
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,190
Now that I understand your combos.

1600
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,770
I wasn't sword proof, guys.

1601
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,430
Okay.

1602
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:29,670
Okay.

1603
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,570
Okay.

1604
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,550
That's why they...

1605
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,610
That's why they made sure nobody has a gun in this world.

1606
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,430
Okay.

1607
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:39,610
Okay.

1608
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:40,570
Okay.

1609
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:42,990
Okay.

1610
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,320
Okay.

1611
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,140
Okay.

1612
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,260
Yeah.

1613
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:51,900
Sorry.

1614
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:51,920
Wait.

1615
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,560
When did I mute myself?

1616
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:57,660
When did I mute...

1617
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:04,340
I was so locked.

1618
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,680
I was muted the whole fight.

1619
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,560
I'm sorry.

1620
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,620
I was shit talking.

1621
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:12,940
I'm...

1622
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:16,960
I'm talking bad shit just to be muted.

1623
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,060
Why did I mute myself?

1624
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,320
Okay, now I'm actually locked in.

1625
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:27,920
Oh, nevermind, like I said that and I fucking missed.

1626
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,380
Now I'm actually locked in.

1627
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,020
Alright.

1628
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:36,980
Dog.

1629
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:37,860
Dog.

1630
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,160
Oh, how do I dog?

1631
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,540
Dog.

1632
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,460
Dog.

1633
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:43,920
Dog.

1634
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:51,780
Okay, now that I know mini monkeys are bullshit, we will not do that again.

1635
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:54,220
What?

1636
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,080
I thought I...

1637
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,290
Okay, I'm not locked in.

1638
01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,690
JK.

1639
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,890
Does it look like I'm not locked in?

1640
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:03,450
Because I'm not.

1641
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:07,350
Jesus.

1642
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,670
What does he even...

1643
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:13,950
Are you fucking... Oh my god.

1644
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,490
Are you serious?

1645
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,390
Where did he go?

1646
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,510
Are you... Oh my god.

1647
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,570
I hate his teleporting abilities!

1648
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,750
Oh my god.

1649
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:29,990
No!

1650
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:31,530
He sent me away from it!

1651
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,810
Oh my god.

1652
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:36,690
He's not messing around.

1653
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:38,530
Okay, now I'm actually locked in.

1654
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:44,010
Now that I know his movesets, I'm actually locked in.

1655
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:44,450
For real.

1656
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,730
Is he even like giving me good shit?

1657
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:02,890
Wait, what do you mean second phase?

1658
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,530
There's no way.

1659
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:05,650
There's no way.

1660
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:10,250
An honorable tiger would not trick me with a second phase.

1661
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,610
Alright.

1662
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,090
Alright.

1663
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,310
No last.

1664
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:15,670
Only gaming.

1665
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:18,810
Only gaming.

1666
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,410
Only gaming.

1667
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:22,810
Like right starting now.

1668
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:23,450
Like right starting now.

1669
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:28,350
Boom!

1670
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,970
Wait, did I do it?

1671
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:31,890
Oh no.

1672
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:32,850
Oh no.

1673
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:33,510
Please.

1674
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:35,650
Boom.

1675
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:36,630
Boom.

1676
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:38,990
Okay, nice.

1677
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:42,750
Lock in.

1678
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:43,090
Lock in.

1679
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,270
That's not fair!

1680
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,230
I dodged it!

1681
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:50,890
What?!

1682
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:53,470
Okay, that was such a dodge!

1683
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:55,970
Okay.

1684
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,600
Oh my god.

1685
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,140
Come on!

1686
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:04,700
What?!

1687
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,460
Okay.

1688
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,720
Alright, I have not downloaded it.

1689
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,240
Guys.

1690
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,340
I might have lied a little bit.

1691
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,560
I have not downloaded it.

1692
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,400
Just a little.

1693
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,140
Oh my god.

1694
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,740
This guy hits so hard.

1695
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,080
Why does he hit so hard?

1696
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:21,560
Alright.

1697
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,500
Did I get command grabs?

1698
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,220
No.

1699
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,000
No!

1700
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:30,320
His command grabs is bullshit!

1701
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,420
Are you fucking...

1702
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,060
How does he still have new moves?

1703
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,380
How does he still...

1704
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:47,080
How does he still have new moves?

1705
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,040
I don't understand.

1706
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,400
How does he...

1707
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,120
How does he still don't understand your moveset?

1708
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,900
How does he still don't understand your moveset?

1709
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,020
Oh my god.

1710
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,220
Oh, please leave me alone!

1711
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:00,200
Oh, please leave me alone!

1712
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:01,980
Please!

1713
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:02,200
Please!

1714
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,420
Oh!

1715
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,460
Oh, that was a sick-ass dodge though.

1716
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:09,680
Oh, that was a sick-ass dodge though.

1717
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:13,260
That was me gaming after, like, fucking it up.

1718
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,200
That was me gaming after, like, fucking it up.

1719
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,340
I finally game.

1720
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,060
Okay, there.

1721
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,640
Tiniest poke of my life.

1722
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,600
No, don't, please, please.

1723
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,400
Please.

1724
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:25,140
Jesus.

1725
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,580
Why is he so difficult?

1726
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,880
Maybe I should upgrade.

1727
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,660
Maybe I should upgrade before I try again.

1728
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:45,850
Okay, this time.

1729
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,210
I'm focused.

1730
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:50,590
I'm so focused.

1731
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,050
I'm so focused.

1732
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:56,970
I'm so focused.

1733
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:58,890
Okay.

1734
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:03,700
Nice.

1735
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,660
Oh, no!

1736
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,800
Not nice!

1737
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,320
Focus, focus, focus, focus.

1738
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,320
Focus, Doki.

1739
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,720
You have to focus.

1740
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,460
You can't let him win!

1741
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,660
You killed all the other Tigers!

1742
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,140
You killed Frank the Tank!

1743
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,780
And Tony the Tiger!

1744
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,240
And then his dad!

1745
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,120
You can't kill this Tiger, too!

1746
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,760
No, Tiger will be safe.

1747
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,340
Nice.

1748
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:38,660
What?!

1749
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,180
Still?!

1750
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,880
How does that hit me?!

1751
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1752
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,240
Oh, God.

1753
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,960
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1754
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,100
That shit's scary!

1755
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,420
Okay.

1756
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,280
God damn it!

1757
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,460
He's a cloud!

1758
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,280
Oh!

1759
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:05,020
What?!

1760
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,500
He broke it?!

1761
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,300
Okay.

1762
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,460
That's not fair.

1763
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:11,900
That's actually not fair.

1764
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:15,780
Okay.

1765
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,020
I can't believe he broke it!

1766
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,950
Okay, I'm just gonna leave when he does that.

1767
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,030
That shit fucking sucks.

1768
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:29,850
Okay, nice.

1769
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:31,650
Okay.

1770
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,870
Okay, I got a smack.

1771
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,810
I got a smack in.

1772
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,610
That's all that matters.

1773
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:40,510
All right.

1774
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,030
I downloaded it.

1775
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:42,290
Oh!

1776
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:44,670
It's not fair!

1777
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,850
The frame dropped!

1778
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:47,290
Fuck me up there!

1779
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:51,350
Oh, my God.

1780
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:55,110
He actually won because my frames dropped!

1781
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,630
That's so bullshit!

1782
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:03,250
My frames dropped and he won!

1783
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,410
It was the ping!

1784
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:10,410
It was actually the ping.

1785
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:14,250
He commands the ping.

1786
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,670
That's not fair.

1787
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:18,990
Okay.

1788
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,710
Oh, my God.

1789
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,230
Broke.

1790
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,890
He's...

1791
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,050
He doesn't want me to have a good day.

1792
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,410
Like, fuck her in particular.

1793
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:36,790
Why did I fucking move away?

1794
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:42,610
Bro, I even moved away!

1795
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,930
And then he was like, and then he sucked me back into the hell.

1796
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:50,690
Oh, my God.

1797
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:54,490
I hate this guy so much.

1798
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,530
I, like, don't know what stance to use, too.

1799
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:01,850
I haven't had a chance to really use my stance.

1800
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:11,910
Am I too underleveled?

1801
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,690
Why is he so difficult?

1802
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:14,970
Oh, my God!

1803
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:16,730
I got salty.

1804
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,110
I had to keep beating all the hard boxes so quickly.

1805
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,710
I'm enjoying this.

1806
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:23,870
Tommy, I hope you fucking take, like, five hours.

1807
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:24,690
Hello?

1808
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:28,010
I don't know what happened!

1809
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:30,910
What the fuck?

1810
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:33,770
I...

1811
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:34,670
Oh, my God.

1812
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,200
That's crazy.

1813
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,040
Okay, like, that's actually so freaky.

1814
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,780
That's so freaky.

1815
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,120
Like, I've never had that happen to me.

1816
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:57,000
I've had so many issues, but, like, but, like, but, like, literally, all three monitors just turned off.

1817
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:02,840
And, like, my PC was still on, but, like, it restarted itself.

1818
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,760
There was not even a blue screen.

1819
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,640
Like, all three monitors just went black.

1820
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,320
That was so weird.

1821
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,760
It was the curse of Tommy.

1822
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,140
Like, was it a power surge?

1823
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,880
Like, what the fuck happened?

1824
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,140
It was so weird.

1825
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,160
And, literally, oh, my God.

1826
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,380
Like, there was no blue screen, too.

1827
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,300
There was no blue screen.

1828
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,520
It just, everything just turned off.

1829
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,160
That was, I've never had that happen to me before.

1830
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,980
So, like, I was like, what the fuck?

1831
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,000
I've had so many PC issues, but I never had a moment where, like, um...

1832
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:06,940
Is it because this area is, like, kicking... Maybe this area is so PC intensive that, like, my PC was... No, I didn't lose power anyway.

1833
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,200
It was literally this.

1834
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:09,680
It was just my PC.

1835
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,480
It literally just...

1836
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,980
Everything, like, all...

1837
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,800
Like, my three monitors, black screen.

1838
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,420
And I was like, what?

1839
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,700
Like, it was so weird.

1840
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,480
Oh, my God.

1841
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,080
No, do I have to do the upgrades again?

1842
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,740
Oh, my God.

1843
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,700
Do I have to... No, okay.

1844
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,320
I don't.

1845
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:31,900
Oh, thank God.

1846
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,780
I was just saying, please don't make me do the upgrades again.

1847
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,620
Please don't make me.

1848
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:41,620
Like, oh, but something's weird.

1849
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:42,860
Oh, my God.

1850
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,420
What happened?

1851
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,940
What am I... Oh.

1852
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:46,760
Wait, what?

1853
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,300
What happened?

1854
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,960
Why did everything just suddenly... No, wait.

1855
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,900
My CPU and GPU are fine.

1856
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,820
What's going on?

1857
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,760
What's going...

1858
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,180
What happened?

1859
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,720
Actually, what happened?

1860
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:05,420
Everything...

1861
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,340
What the fuck?

1862
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,920
What happened?

1863
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,020
Okay, give me a second.

1864
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,540
That's so weird.

1865
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,060
Me...

1866
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,720
I don't know what happened.

1867
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,520
Alright.

1868
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,320
Oh, my God.

1869
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,180
It's every...

1870
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,300
The moment I cursed Tommy out.

1871
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,300
I got hit with karma.

1872
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,020
It's not fair.

1873
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,280
Why does this happen to me?

1874
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,620
Why do I get karma?

1875
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,640
He started it.

1876
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,560
Tommy, I...

1877
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,360
This was self-defense.

1878
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,380
This was self-def...

1879
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:56,960
Why?

1880
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,460
This was literally self-defense.

1881
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,500
I was defending myself.

1882
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,940
Every time I can't even fucking defend myself.

1883
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,460
I can't even...

1884
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:18,940
I can't even defend myself.

1885
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,140
It's so fucked.

1886
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:22,680
Alright.

1887
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,640
I'm gonna reboot.

1888
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,220
I'm gonna reboot Wukong.

1889
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:30,660
Why does this happen to me?

1890
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,080
Tommy has blood.

1891
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:37,500
You have my blessing.

1892
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,140
Don't give me a commuter.

1893
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Rest in peace.

1894
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,140
God, thank you for the super chat.

1895
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:42,560
Thank you.

1896
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:43,080
Thank you.

1897
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,320
Okay, I rebooted Wukong.

1898
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,900
Maybe that will fix it.

1899
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:53,410
It was self-defense, your honor.

1900
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:57,870
I swear.

1901
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:59,590
It was self-defense.

1902
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:02,390
He shot the first bullet.

1903
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:07,750
Am I not allowed to defend myself after that?

1904
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:11,470
Alright.

1905
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:12,550
Let's see.

1906
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,750
It's this area.

1907
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:16,810
It's this fucking area.

1908
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:18,250
I'll come back to the tiger later.

1909
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:22,990
Exactly!

1910
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,090
In my defense, Tommy started it.

1911
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,270
Oh my god.

1912
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:35,250
What happened?

1913
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:41,910
Alright, we're coming back to the tiger another time.

1914
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:43,030
I can't.

1915
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:45,310
Okay.

1916
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:46,710
Okay.

1917
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:47,330
What happened?

1918
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:50,610
What happened?

1919
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:53,250
Okay, everything's fine for now.

1920
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:54,170
Okay, graphics.

1921
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,790
Okay.

1922
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:00,150
We'll go back to hide because we're leaving this area.

1923
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,050
Oh my god, what happened?

1924
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:03,370
What happened?

1925
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,990
How did everything go so wrong?

1926
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:16,130
How did my PC restart and then everything went wrong?

1927
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,210
How did this happen?

1928
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,390
I don't understand.

1929
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,770
I literally...

1930
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,190
Oh my god.

1931
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:32,210
This is Tommy's fault.

1932
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:35,110
This is Tommy's fault.

1933
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:38,410
This is fucking Tommy's fault.

1934
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:44,910
You pissed on the wrong Tommy.

1935
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:47,670
I believe Tommy.

1936
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:48,890
I believe Tommy.

1937
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:54,850
Everything was fine until Tommy cursed me.

1938
01:31:57,850 --> 01:32:00,370
No, there's no way this is the resolution.

1939
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:02,710
It can't be the resolution.

1940
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:05,750
Alright.

1941
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:08,830
Crap, it's 120.

1942
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,330
Okay, maybe that's it.

1943
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,290
Oh my god.

1944
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,170
Tommy, this is your fault.

1945
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:27,210
Note to self, do not piss off Tommy.

1946
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:30,470
Do not piss off Tommy.

1947
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:35,810
How could this happen to me?

1948
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:40,450
I didn't make any... I didn't make that many mistakes.

1949
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:45,630
Oh my god.

1950
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:47,930
I hear you.

1951
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:51,610
Me oopsie daisies.

1952
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:53,830
The client pleads.

1953
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:55,630
Tommy started it first.

1954
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:00,490
We're not sorry.

1955
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:03,630
I refuse to apologize to Tommy.

1956
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:08,530
I refuse to apologize for Tommy.

1957
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,910
Okay, temperature is too high.

1958
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:18,490
Whoa.

1959
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,830
Hahaha.

1960
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,590
It might be that.

1961
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,750
It really might be that.

1962
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:30,070
Alright.

1963
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:32,870
Don't worry.

1964
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:33,710
Things will be...

1965
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,270
Things will be okay.

1966
01:33:35,670 --> 01:33:37,790
Things will be okay.

1967
01:33:40,730 --> 01:33:41,890
You had to...

1968
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,370
He deserted!

1969
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:44,390
Hahaha.

1970
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,050
Hahaha.

1971
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:49,490
What did you do, Tommy?

1972
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:52,410
What did you do to my PC?

1973
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:53,650
Hahaha.

1974
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:58,190
I was fine before God.

1975
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:00,690
Everything was fine.

1976
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:02,690
Hahaha.

1977
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:06,230
Hahaha.

1978
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:09,110
Oh my god.

1979
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:14,670
To be fair, it was half a compliment because I said these would be all the hard losses easily.

1980
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:16,450
Tommy... Oh my god.

1981
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:17,390
Look at what you did!

1982
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:18,310
Now he's angry!

1983
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:19,030
Hahaha.

1984
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,010
Now he's here to beat you up, Tommy.

1985
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:24,170
That's right.

1986
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:28,750
My muscle is here to beat you up, Tommy.

1987
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:29,710
Hahaha.

1988
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:31,950
That's fucking right.

1989
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:33,290
Hahaha.

1990
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:35,890
Hahaha.

1991
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:37,890
Who the fuck am I?

1992
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:38,930
Hahaha.

1993
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:40,030
Hahaha.

1994
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,870
Let's fight a boss.

1995
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:45,430
What's this?

1996
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,430
Who are these guys?

1997
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:48,950
Oh, it's okay now.

1998
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:49,710
Oh, thank God.

1999
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,830
Everything is okay now.

2000
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:51,630
Okay.

2001
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,170
Everything is okay.

2002
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,210
We're not going...

2003
01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:00,830
We're gonna fight the tiger another time.

2004
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:02,250
I think...

2005
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:03,550
I think the tiger...

2006
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:05,650
The effects and quality...

2007
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:08,190
The tiger was so HD...

2008
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:11,870
My PC had to restart itself to protect himself.

2009
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:15,730
It has to be the hub.

2010
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:18,030
There's something wrong with the hub.

2011
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:19,690
There's something wrong.

2012
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:20,650
Hahaha.

2013
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:23,330
I'm gonna find where Tommy lives.

2014
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:25,010
But like, as a joke.

2015
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:25,690
Hahaha.

2016
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:27,730
Hahaha.

2017
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,320
It's meditation time.

2018
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,720
I'm enhancing the location right now.

2019
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,500
Hahaha.

2020
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:49,560
Talk Tommy.

2021
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:50,640
Hahaha.

2022
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:51,720
Hahaha.

2023
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,820
It's too late hearing Doc's first name.

2024
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:56,440
Hahaha.

2025
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:57,640
Hahaha.

2026
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,140
There can't be that many Tommies in the world.

2027
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:01,880
Hahaha.

2028
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,220
Hahaha.

2029
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,640
Alright, let's see.

2030
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,520
What's that?

2031
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,120
Alright, nice.

2032
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,480
We have the enhanced tiger subdued.

2033
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,080
Oh wait, does this subdue that tiger?

2034
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,280
That's right.

2035
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,480
That's right, Tommy.

2036
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,940
Shouldn't have fucking called your...

2037
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:23,620
Shouldn't have fucking called yourself Tommy.

2038
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,280
That's on you for...

2039
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:28,740
Hahaha.

2040
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,960
For making your first name your username.

2041
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,600
Who said Tommy?

2042
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:35,460
Who the fuck would call themselves...

2043
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:38,280
Okay, why would you call yourself Tommy on the internet?

2044
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,460
That is like...

2045
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,000
Like, why would you...

2046
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,800
I've always wanted to be a Tommy.

2047
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,640
Like, why would you...

2048
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,160
call yourself Tommy on the internet?

2049
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:53,130
You can call yourself anything...

2050
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,010
and you pick Tommy.

2051
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:54,890
Like...

2052
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:57,290
Yeah, officially she defeated...

2053
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:58,170
Tommy Pickles.

2054
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,810
Alright.

2055
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:01,910
Where do we go?

2056
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:04,890
Where the fuck do we go?

2057
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,950
Guys, I don't think I'm finishing chapter 3, guys.

2058
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:10,870
Oh my god.

2059
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:13,490
Because I don't think we're finishing chapter 3 today.

2060
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:14,030
Hahaha.

2061
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:18,190
Power Rangers.

2062
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:18,730
Power Rangers.

2063
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:20,790
He's just a big fan of Rugrats.

2064
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:21,470
No key.

2065
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,510
Okay.

2066
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:27,410
Look, even dad's...

2067
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:28,230
gonna beat you up, Tommy.

2068
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:29,070
Hahaha.

2069
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:31,030
Leave Tommy alone.

2070
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:32,350
Hahaha.

2071
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:36,530
Can't believe it.

2072
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:39,110
Streamer bullies...

2073
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:40,010
all Tommies.

2074
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,540
You're the...

2075
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,120
strongest Tommy.

2076
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:47,920
He's Tommy Prime.

2077
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,060
Alright, nice.

2078
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,620
Spirit I won't use.

2079
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Is the lag...

2080
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,100
gone now?

2081
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,400
I can't tell.

2082
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,660
Because I have to look at my game.

2083
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,760
I can't tell.

2084
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:01,800
Wait, oh.

2085
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,240
That's right.

2086
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,240
Tommie.

2087
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:26,880
If you can't beat me...

2088
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,560
I may as well...

2089
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,500
take a bite out of the wound.

2090
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:33,880
I want to see...

2091
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:37,480
the last two games of Tommie.

2092
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,820
All Tommies?

2093
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,220
Yes.

2094
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,640
It's more fun to be a Tommie than to be Tommie...

2095
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,800
and play Tommie.

2096
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,640
Yeah, he only has one master.

2097
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,240
Seems like a little shit.

2098
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,900
Is he like a good Buddha?

2099
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:07,860
Or like...

2100
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:15,360
The Buddhas that are like pricks in the Journey to the West.

2101
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,940
Like the ones that really hate Shim Hong.

2102
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,440
Does he actually like me or not hate me?

2103
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,080
We don't know.

2104
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,540
He looks not evil.

2105
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,180
Yeah, but that's how they get you.

2106
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,500
That's how some of the Buddhas get you.

2107
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,960
We don't know.

2108
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:36,760
Because some Buddhas are assholes in the Journey to the West story.

2109
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,760
Because they really hate him.

2110
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,440
To be fair, it could be self-defense for the Buddhas.

2111
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,260
Because he is an asshole.

2112
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,200
Like, Shim Hong is an asshole.

2113
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,800
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

2114
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,200
Wukong is sort of asking for it.

2115
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,000
Because he's like...

2116
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,460
You know, he tried to kill them.

2117
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,180
Because he's like...

2118
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:06,660
He's like, I hate the gods.

2119
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:08,220
And then he tried to kill them.

2120
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,130
Alright, let's see.

2121
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:19,070
Never reaching heaven with that mindset.

2122
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:22,510
I mean, Wukong, all he wanted to do was take over the heavens.

2123
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,590
Yeah, they're like super petty.

2124
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:41,090
Alright.

2125
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,610
We consume.

2126
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:44,610
Consume.

2127
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,930
The heavens kind of suck.

2128
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:49,490
I don't blame him.

2129
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:51,210
Hahaha.

2130
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:51,350
Hahaha.

2131
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:53,850
God.

2132
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,410
This area is so huge.

2133
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:58,910
Oh my god.

2134
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,210
Why did I fucking stumble?

2135
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:01,590
Yes, pig!

2136
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:02,490
Spit on him!

2137
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:04,430
That's what they want!

2138
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,440
What's this?

2139
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:13,840
Where am I?

2140
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,240
I'm in a perpetual state of like...

2141
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:17,760
Where am I?

2142
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:18,600
Hahaha.

2143
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:21,800
Let's see.

2144
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,960
Get out of here.

2145
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,560
Get out of here.

2146
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,180
Now where am I?

2147
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,220
Oh, there's another Buddha.

2148
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,060
Another Buddha statue.

2149
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,680
I have to find all the statues?

2150
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,980
Yeah, but like...

2151
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,480
He has the ears.

2152
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,020
So shouldn't we listen to him?

2153
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,640
I didn't find all the statues.

2154
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:53,720
All four of them.

2155
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,240
That's right.

2156
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:56,700
What are you gonna do?

2157
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:57,120
You're blind.

2158
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:58,700
That's right.

2159
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:00,340
What you gonna do?

2160
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:00,700
Oh.

2161
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,060
Oh.

2162
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,080
That's what he's gonna do.

2163
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:04,360
Poke!

2164
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:04,740
Oh!

2165
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:06,800
Oh my god!

2166
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:07,680
Yes, heal me.

2167
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:08,700
Spit it on...

2168
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:09,420
Hahaha.

2169
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:12,820
I shouldn't encourage that.

2170
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:13,820
I think he likes it.

2171
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:14,800
Hahaha.

2172
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,800
I don't think he knew...

2173
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:20,800
I don't think he even realizes he has healing properties.

2174
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,620
We just discovered it.

2175
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:23,400
Later on.

2176
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,620
All right.

2177
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:27,740
That's right.

2178
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:28,120
Don't worry.

2179
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,060
I got you, Chewbacca.

2180
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:32,580
All right.

2181
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:38,860
Oh, yeah.

2182
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,880
Oh, I remember that story.

2183
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,320
I remember that.

2184
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,100
The hand story.

2185
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,520
A lot of people did adaptations on that particular one.

2186
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:51,040
Because everyone was like, Lil can't even leave his hot hand.

2187
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:56,520
Oh, shit.

2188
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:56,740
Please.

2189
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:57,760
Please leave me alone.

2190
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,240
Please.

2191
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,620
I just want to kill you.

2192
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,340
Okay.

2193
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:03,140
Nice.

2194
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:04,860
Oh, not nice.

2195
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,460
Not nice.

2196
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:06,840
Poke!

2197
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:10,880
All right.

2198
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:11,760
Nice.

2199
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:12,500
That should be it.

2200
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,360
All right.

2201
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:14,680
Buddha time.

2202
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,440
Where is the master?

2203
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,460
Is he dead?

2204
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,080
I don't know.

2205
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:24,060
I don't know.

2206
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:26,500
I don't know.

2207
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,520
But is he dead?

2208
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:31,100
Why is it just you?

2209
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,700
Where's there the rest of our gang?

2210
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,180
Where's the other guy?

2211
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,680
I don't remember the other guy's name because he's not as important to me.

2212
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:40,620
I always only remember the master, Chewbacca, and Shingpong.

2213
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:42,860
I don't remember the fourth guy.

2214
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,720
I never remember his name.

2215
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,400
He's just there.

2216
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,320
The fourth guy?

2217
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,720
He's just there for me.

2218
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:54,180
I'm sorry.

2219
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:55,820
I never remember his name.

2220
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,380
The other guy.

2221
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:04,000
Oh, you mean the horse doki.

2222
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:09,480
That's so fucked.

2223
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,060
The horse.

2224
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,040
There's also the horse.

2225
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,160
There's a fourth guy.

2226
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,860
Yes, there's a fourth guy.

2227
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:26,300
But no one remembers his name.

2228
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,000
I don't remember his name.

2229
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,180
The fuck is the fourth...

2230
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:30,900
Oh, there it is.

2231
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:31,920
Is it that Buddha?

2232
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:34,740
Did I bow to that one already?

2233
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,000
The dragon horse.

2234
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,340
Guys, there's a fourth one.

2235
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,820
Did I already bow to this one?

2236
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,680
Yeah, I must have, right?

2237
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:48,260
Yeah, I have.

2238
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,460
Where the fuck is the fourth Buddha statue?

2239
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,760
Where the fuck

2240
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:56,040
is the fourth Buddha statue?

2241
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,420
On the path?

2242
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,620
Did I actually miss one?

2243
01:44:58,660 --> 01:44:59,360
God damn it.

2244
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:04,880
Okay.

2245
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,370
I definitely am like...

2246
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:11,260
I don't know what happened.

2247
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:16,040
That PC restart really fucked up my...

2248
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:21,360
The PC's not having a good time.

2249
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:22,480
Oh, there it is.

2250
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:32,940
There you go.

2251
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,740
Tommy, it's Tommy.

2252
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:37,620
Oh.

2253
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:38,740
Yeah, what's that sound?

2254
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,260
It's something to do with the game.

2255
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:50,180
Because the game is...

2256
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:56,540
The game, for some reason, is like, I'm gonna make sure you have the worst time of your life.

2257
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,100
Like, I don't understand.

2258
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:01,060
Like, what happened?

2259
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,200
How did I suddenly...

2260
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:08,000
How did I suddenly start lagging out of my...

2261
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,980
How did I start lagging?

2262
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:12,120
It doesn't make any sense.

2263
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:13,900
Okay.

2264
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,320
I will never apologize to Tommy.

2265
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:19,020
He did this.

2266
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,040
He caused this.

2267
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:27,550
Alright, here we go.

2268
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:28,830
I did it.

2269
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:30,110
I talked to all four statues.

2270
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,330
What?

2271
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:54,010
Yeah, where's the path?

2272
01:46:58,230 --> 01:46:58,710
...

2273
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:00,310
...

2274
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:01,130
...

2275
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:02,830
...

2276
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:03,310
...

2277
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:08,050
No!

2278
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:09,010
I didn't do that!

2279
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:09,910
Now we're gonna be cursed!

2280
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:10,610
...

2281
01:47:13,710 --> 01:47:16,050
You never hit the Buddha!

2282
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:25,470
We had an entire fucking book about the punishments!

2283
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:35,630
We had an entire book where we got punished for trying to hit the Buddha!

2284
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:37,370
Have you not learned?

2285
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:38,730
Oh no, he's gone.

2286
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:39,790
He forgot.

2287
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:40,790
He forgot.

2288
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:50,130
Let's see.

2289
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,610
He's gotta take the lock.

2290
01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:53,630
Wait, which one was the door that opened?

2291
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:55,430
Was it this?

2292
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,190
No.

2293
01:47:57,670 --> 01:47:58,850
What's the pathway?

2294
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:01,050
It's like the pathway has opened.

2295
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:02,610
Which one?

2296
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,030
Is it this?

2297
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:09,990
Does this just go up?

2298
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,390
Alright, what if I turn everything low?

2299
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:15,930
Something happened when the PC restarted.

2300
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:17,390
Something.

2301
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:22,110
What the fuck happened?

2302
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:24,910
Tommy, what did you do?

2303
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:32,350
What did you do?

2304
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:34,610
What did you do?

2305
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:36,450
What did you do?

2306
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:38,030
What did you do?

2307
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:39,450
Tommy already cursed you.

2308
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:40,910
Buddha curses nothing.

2309
01:48:45,670 --> 01:48:46,990
Something happened.

2310
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:51,150
And I'll never know what he did to my PC.

2311
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:54,750
Something happened in the span of...

2312
01:48:55,930 --> 01:48:57,630
In the short time frame.

2313
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:01,550
Alright.

2314
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:03,150
Just...

2315
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:03,410
No!

2316
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:05,750
I will never apologize!

2317
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:09,810
It was not my fault!

2318
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:16,770
If Wukong never apologized, I'll never apologize!

2319
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:21,230
Alright,

2320
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:28,970
let's see.

2321
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:33,330
Look, if Wukong can become a Buddha after everything he's done...

2322
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,450
Like, I'm saying.

2323
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:42,090
Oh, it's Sandy!

2324
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:43,970
Okay, that's the guy.

2325
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:45,870
I'm gonna forget his name again.

2326
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:50,500
Go in.

2327
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:59,700
Everything Wukong has done and he was able to be a Buddha?

2328
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:00,660
I mean...

2329
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,460
Look, he...

2330
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:09,040
He had a lot of people to apologize for.

2331
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,560
And if he only apologized to one person after everything he's done...

2332
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,580
All I'm saying is that, like...

2333
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:18,300
Might as well just be no apologies.

2334
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,780
Might as well.

2335
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:26,680
Alright.

2336
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:29,900
Alright, guys.

2337
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,720
I'm gonna call it here.

2338
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,060
I'm sorry.

2339
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:34,980
I know it was a super short stream, guys.

2340
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:43,740
I know it was a super short stream, but we're gonna call it here.

2341
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:45,620
We...

2342
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,500
We're having some...

2343
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:47,980
We're having some...

2344
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:49,780
Some technical difficulties.

2345
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:52,280
I'm up...

2346
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:52,920
I'm up my flow.

2347
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,760
I'm off my flow.

2348
01:50:59,000 --> 01:50:59,620
Okay.

2349
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:01,680
I'm sorry we couldn't...

2350
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:02,000
I...

2351
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,800
I think, like...

2352
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,060
I honestly think the...

2353
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,080
That hub...

2354
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,480
I think the...

2355
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,580
Uh...

2356
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:12,000
The hub, like, fucked it up.

2357
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:13,300
Like, my PC...

2358
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,380
Like, overheated in the hub.

2359
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:16,020
Because...

2360
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:17,720
There was so much stuff there.

2361
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,500
Like...

2362
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,300
So...

2363
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:23,140
So we're gonna call it here and let my PC rest.

2364
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,020
Yeah, I think my PC has to rest right now.

2365
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,300
Anyway, guys.

2366
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,260
Um...

2367
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,220
As always, everybody stay hydrated.

2368
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,180
Posture check.

2369
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,020
Get a move around to get that blood flowing.

2370
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,120
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

2371
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,680
Because you deserve it.

2372
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,380
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2373
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:40,300
Bye, guys.

2374
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:41,300
Bye.

2375
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,000
We gotta let PC rest after everything today.

2376
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,020
