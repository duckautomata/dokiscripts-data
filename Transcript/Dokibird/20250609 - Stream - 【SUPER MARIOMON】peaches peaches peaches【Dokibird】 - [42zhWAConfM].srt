1
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,290
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,910
Oh my god, sorry.

3
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,590
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,310
I've been late again.

5
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,410
I'm so...

6
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:57,230
I... Oh, there was... You guys didn't... We're not reading... We're not reading the pre-chat.

7
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,890
Sorry, my brain is, like, frazzled.

8
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,430
I've been awake since, like, 8.30 in the morning, so I'm so tired.

9
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,530
I went to bed at, like, 2 a.m.

10
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,130
because I was working late at night.

11
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,210
I was working a lot.

12
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,370
And, uh... And, uh, I was... Oh my gosh.

13
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,370
Um... So, and I've been... My brain is just all over the place.

14
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,130
I was gonna say, like... I was gonna, like, get some coffee or, like, GamerSupps or something.

15
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,610
By the way, we used TokiBerry for 10% off of GamerSupps.

16
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,770
Um... Just so my brain can... Oh my gosh.

17
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,430
My brain can, like, get kickstarted or something.

18
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,190
Be like...

19
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,210
Rav up that brain right now.

20
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,750
Um... But, yes.

21
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,570
Uh, I was late because, um... Uh, my cleaner was here today.

22
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,350
Um... She was here since 9 in the morning.

23
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,770
And it's now at 1 p.m.

24
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,450
Um... And, uh... And so, um...

25
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,430
Is that cleaner single, Toki?

26
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,150
Thank you, Super Chat.

27
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,710
Thank you, BrokenBud.

28
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,510
Um... So, uh, new cleaner... Uh... A new cleaner, uh... Came in today.

29
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,810
Um... I usually have a different cleaner...

30
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,130
That comes by, but I think maybe she was busy for today.

31
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,550
Um... And so, um... And... Uh, she was like, Oh, what do you want... How do you want me to clean this?

32
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,430
And I was just like, Oh, just, you know, clean my office.

33
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,670
Clean the bedroom.

34
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,370
Uh... The kitchen area.

35
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,550
Uh... And all that stuff.

36
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,070
But I gave her a new task.

37
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,050
I had, like, a bunch of, like, boxes.

38
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,850
From, like, packages that have been sent.

39
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,630
Like, it was, like, giant pile of boxes.

40
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,610
And, um... I asked her if she could de- de- de- de-assemble these boxes.

41
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,570
And, like, fly in them.

42
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,890
Because I don't know how to do it.

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,470
Um...

44
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,290
I don't know how to do it properly.

45
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,610
So, I was like, Well, I'm just gonna hoard all these boxes.

46
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,150
Until... Sorry.

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,830
Disassemble.

48
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,090
I was gonna... I'm gonna hoard all these boxes.

49
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,790
From all these packages I got.

50
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,070
From, like, Amazon.

51
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,370
Gamer Soaps.

52
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,150
Um...

53
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,530
P.O.

54
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,990
Box.

55
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,770
P.R.

56
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,430
Boxes.

57
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,490
And all that stuff.

58
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,030
And then, like...

59
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,910
And I'll have the cleaner disassemble them for me.

60
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,930
Because I don't know how to do that.

61
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,750
Uh...

62
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,870
I don't know how to flatten it properly.

63
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,910
And it seems very hard.

64
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,970
And...

65
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,970
And a lot of work.

66
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,910
Uh...

67
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,470
And then I was like, Oh, could you do that too?

68
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,410
Until she did.

69
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,950
So...

70
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,750
Um...

71
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,150
So, anyway.

72
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,310
Uh...

73
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,570
No.

74
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,070
No.

75
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,130
It's like...

76
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,430
You gotta cut it a certain way.

77
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,790
And then you gotta...

78
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,650
Flatten it.

79
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,610
And that's...

80
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,920
So much energy.

81
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,390
And I'm...

82
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,190
So tired.

83
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,490
I'm...

84
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,030
I'm...

85
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,390
I'm...

86
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,590
Not so Deadpool.

87
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,310
Thank you more of the super chat.

88
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,830
Thank you.

89
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,470
Thank you.

90
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,810
The keycap breakdown boxes.

91
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,890
Thank goodness.

92
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,150
She is a great streamer.

93
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,910
Anyway.

94
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:52,890
Anyway.

95
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,810
Anyway.

96
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,110
Um...

97
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,910
But, like...

98
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,110
She was like, Oh, you...

99
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,850
Are you okay if I rearrange stuff?

100
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,330
And I was like, Yeah, that's fine.

101
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,530
But, like...

102
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,650
And then I was like, Okay, I'm gonna take a nap in my bed.

103
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,790
I'm gonna be in my bedroom taking a nap.

104
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,690
So you can do...

105
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,890
You can clean all of this first.

106
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,710
And then do the bedroom last.

107
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,950
Because...

108
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,330
I'm...

109
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:13,690
I'm...

110
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,730
I'm gonna take a nap.

111
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,610
Because I'm really tired.

112
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,610
By the way, I ended up not taking a nap.

113
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,890
Because I had to lock dad in my bedroom.

114
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,970
Because he was being a little...

115
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,850
Bitch boy.

116
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,430
Because he could hear...

117
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,710
Things...

118
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,810
I didn't want him to, like, interfere with the cleaning.

119
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,910
But the cleaning lady...

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,630
This cleaning lady actually is not...

121
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,590
Afraid of dogs.

122
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,190
But then I didn't want him to, like...

123
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,490
Interfere with the cleaning lady.

124
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,030
With the cleaning.

125
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,770
So then I was like, Okay, you're gonna be in my bedroom.

126
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,910
And you're gonna stay locked in here...

127
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,770
For a while.

128
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,150
Until, like, she's done.

129
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,510
But then, because he was a little bitch boy, he kept like whimpering, he kept making noises.

130
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,590
At first he was like barking and stuff and I showed him the bark.

131
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,030
I was like, don't bark!

132
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,850
And then he's like, oh I know, okay, I won't do that anymore.

133
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,750
And then he started whimpering and he's like, but I hear things outside!

134
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,510
There's someone outside!

135
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,270
There's someone

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,020
outside!

137
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,560
I hear them!

138
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,700
I hear them!

139
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,580
Let me out!

140
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,940
Let me see who it is!

141
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,880
But he knows who's outside, it's literally the cleaning lady.

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,460
So it's like, like it's not gonna be anything different.

143
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,960
He's like, the voices!

144
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,380
I hear the voices in my eyes!

145
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,180
Thank you for the 10 gift of ships, thank you, thank you!

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,580
Anyway, so like he's just, he was just like making so many noises and stuff.

147
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,460
While I was trying to sleep.

148
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,180
So I couldn't sleep, I couldn't take my nap.

149
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,940
And then like, I was like, fine, I'll just, I'll just live with it.

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,500
I'll, I'll, I'll stay up.

151
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,800
Please let me out so I can start flirting with that pretty lady!

152
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,160
How dare you, Doki!

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,060
Restricting him from pretty ladies!

154
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,940
He was like, she was like, right there!

155
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,380
And you had to close that door on him!

156
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,860
He was so close, yet so far at the same time!

157
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:34,660
Anyway, so, okay, so then, you know, obviously I couldn't sleep so I came out and I like looked at my desk and like, almost everything was gone from my desk!

158
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,940
So, I was, you know, when she was like, oh, can I like rearrange things a little?

159
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
And I was like, yeah, sure!

160
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,660
I didn't expect to see like, my floor, incredibly clean!

161
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,920
There were boxes on my floor, there were like, socks on my floor, there was like, you know, like maybe like a receipt or two that I just didn't pick up.

162
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,360
And then, like, my two desks, I have two tables, like, one on the side and one where my, you know, my old setup is.

163
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,980
Um, and then, uh, I was just like, where is it?

164
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:17,820
Like, my water was gone, my vitamins were gone, um, um, I had like a lot of, like, paper and stuff on my other desk right here.

165
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,320
And then, I was just like, oh my god, it's all gone!

166
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,820
Like, I was just like, where did everything go?

167
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,620
I don't even remember half the things that were on my desk.

168
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,920
It was just like, I, there was just, it's just empty now, other than my streaming setup.

169
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,720
Um, so I was like, so surprised.

170
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,060
I did not realize when she was like, uh, oh, um, you can't rearrange stuff.

171
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,060
She would actually like, you know, fix my life.

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,720
Like...

173
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,640
But yeah, she even like, you know, put my socks in the, in the washing machine for me and everything.

174
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
She like, picked up my socks and just put it in there.

175
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,760
I was so surprised.

176
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,580
My other cleaner didn't do that.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Um, she would like, leave things where she's like, she like, wouldn't touch stuff if like, you know, she'd be like, ooh, like, ooh, I don't know if I should touch it.

178
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,660
So, um, um, but then the other maid didn't fucking care.

179
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,500
Like, the other, the other cleaner, the other cleaner didn't even fucking care.

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,660
She was like, this is a problem.

181
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,080
And then literally just like, put everything away.

182
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,260
Like, she owned the place.

183
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,620
So I was very surprised.

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,640
Um, the only issue is that, I don't know where anything is right now.

185
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,380
Like, she was like, oh yeah, I rearranged all your stuff in your cupboards and your drawers and everything.

186
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,920
So I'm like, oh, so I don't know where anything is at the moment.

187
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:53,080
I, I, I, I, what I, my most fear is just the fact that like, I'm scared she, um, she threw away stuff that might be important.

188
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,660
So that, I, I don't know, I don't want to dig through trash guys.

189
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,640
I don't know.

190
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm so, do I just trust her?

191
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
And not look through that?

192
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,620
Like, do I just, I don't know.

193
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:12,980
Maybe, maybe, you know, if it gets thrown away, that's just life telling me it might not have been that important.

194
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:20,780
I, I, I, I just, I don't know.

195
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,860
If, if, if it's, I still have the trash bag.

196
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,880
Cause she's like, oh, I'll throw away, I can take away your garbage too.

197
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:41,040
Um, but then I said no, because, um, um, I said no, because like, you have, she has to like, go to like, the, the garbage room is locked with my key.

198
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,180
Like, you have to have my key and fob to like, unlock the garbage door.

199
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,220
So I was like, oh, it's such a hassle for you to come back downstairs and then come back upstairs, back and forth.

200
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,880
Like, she couldn't just like, you know, throw it away and just leave.

201
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,300
She has to like, come back upstairs to give me back my key and everything.

202
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,060
So I was like, oh, now it's fine.

203
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,140
I'll just throw it away on my own time.

204
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:11,180
And along with the, um, um, along with like, uh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, the cardboard boxes she disassembled.

205
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,800
So I was just like, ah, now it's fine.

206
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,340
Next thing, thank you for the Super Chat.

207
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,100
Thank you, thank you.

208
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,560
Our friends forgot important things to run away by cleaning people.

209
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,660
I don't know if I risk it.

210
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
Thank you for the Super Chat.

211
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,580
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,540
You know what's surprising?

213
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,100
Okay, so...

214
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,840
Oh my gosh, I don't want to dig through trash.

215
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:35,100
I don't know what she's... I don't know.

216
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't want to dig through it.

217
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,680
Anyway, um...

218
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Oh fuck, I lost my train of thought.

219
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm so tired.

220
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,280
You know, like, when you're more tired, you're more forgetful.

221
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,320
I lost my train of thought.

222
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,780
Fuck, oh, what was I on?

223
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,960
What was I talking about, guys, before that?

224
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,400
Zyka, thank you for the magenta soup!

225
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,320
Thank you, thank you.

226
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,240
Thank you for being here after all these years.

227
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,220
You being competitive gamer makes me so happy.

228
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,580
Today is my birthday!

229
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,040
I wish you a happy memory throughout the journey along with all the Horseоздings here.

230
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,980
Happy Birthday, Zyko.

231
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,040
Happy Birthday to you.

232
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,880
Happy Birthday to you.

233
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,000
Happy Birthday dear Zyko.

234
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,780
Happy Birthday to you.

235
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,300
Yeah!

236
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,380
Happy Birthday.

237
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,240
Okay, also, um...

238
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,920
I can't.

239
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,700
I can't see this for, like...

240
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,460
I... I can't.

241
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,100
Okay, give me a sec.

242
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,880
Let me, like be here.

243
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,640
Okay, there you go.

244
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,080
Sorry.

245
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,400
I just can't see...

246
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm not...

247
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,440
It was bothering me a lot.

248
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,380
So I'll lower the music a little bit.

249
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,900
What was I on before I was talking about garbage?

250
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,680
Fuck, okay.

251
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,540
Sorry, guys.

252
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,720
I need you guys to remind me.

253
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,240
I'm gonna get gamer subs after this tangent.

254
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
After the cleaning tangent.

255
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,020
Just so my brain can start remembering things again.

256
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,940
The new system?

257
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,520
Oh, like how she rearranged everything.

258
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,020
Okay, something about...

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,280
Oh my god, it was something important.

260
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,500
Fuck, oh my god.

261
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
Something important about the cleaning.

262
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,100
Give me a sec, guys.

263
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,840
I need to reboot my brain again.

264
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,280
What was it?

265
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,260
Oh,

266
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,120
fuck.

267
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,160
Okay, so she wanted to do the cleaning.

268
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,380
She was drinking through the trash to find stuff.

269
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,860
I don't want to do it because I know I should.

270
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,680
I know I should because I don't know if she like...

271
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm just worried.

272
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
Oh yeah, she like...

273
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh yeah, okay, I remember.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, so...

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,440
Like she even like...

276
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,980
So...

277
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,660
I can't spoil what it is.

278
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
But like...

279
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,220
I got sent a package from...

280
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,820
Uh...

281
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,120
Uh...

282
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
My new distributor.

283
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,300
For like...

284
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,420
New merch and stuff.

285
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,400
Um...

286
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,340
But this was a while ago.

287
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,920
I got sent about it for like...

288
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,640
Two months ago.

289
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,920
But it was still in my room.

290
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,640
And then like...

291
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:03,980
They wanted...

292
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,940
Like one or two months ago.

293
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,560
And it was like...

294
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
They wanted my opinion on like stuff.

295
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,960
Because they sent me the sample.

296
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,580
And it was been in my room.

297
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,220
Like the box that's been in my room.

298
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,920
And then she even took that box.

299
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,420
Because I...

300
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,660
I like gave her a pile of boxes.

301
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,220
To disassemble.

302
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,540
I gave her like a pile...

303
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,800
No, it's still Gamersupps.

304
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,180
Gamersupps is my new distributor.

305
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,520
Um...

306
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,120
But...

307
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,420
Uh...

308
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,280
They're not working as Gamersupps.

309
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,620
They're just acting as my distributor.

310
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,740
So they're not...

311
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,000
It's not like it's like under the Gamersupp website.

312
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,640
They're like...

313
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,300
Acting as a distributor for me.

314
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,160
That's why I don't say Gamersupps.

315
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,220
I just say distributor.

316
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,340
Um...

317
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,580
Anyway.

318
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,320
Anyway.

319
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,900
They're like acting independently away...

320
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,280
Not as Gamersupps.

321
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,160
For my...

322
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,140
For my merch.

323
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,040
Um...

324
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,380
Anyway.

325
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,420
What I was saying was that...

326
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,820
Uh...

327
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,440
So like...

328
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,020
I had that box there.

329
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,780
With the product that was there.

330
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,380
Like the merch.

331
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,120
Whatever it is.

332
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,120
I can't say what it is.

333
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,280
Because they'll spoil it.

334
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,260
Um...

335
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,640
Um...

336
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,000
But anyway.

337
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,640
I had a pile of boxes for her to disassemble in the kitchen.

338
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,980
But while she was cleaning my office.

339
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,040
She like...

340
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,220
Took that box.

341
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,160
And like...

342
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,660
Put it in the disassemble area too.

343
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,920
She like disassemb...

344
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,560
She like...

345
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,080
With her own free will.

346
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,260
Like...

347
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,620
Disassembled that box.

348
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,620
And like...

349
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,060
Like...

350
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,160
Put the merch stuff.

351
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,420
And rearrange that merch stuff.

352
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,480
In a different location.

353
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,900
So she went like...

354
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,700
Above and beyond.

355
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,380
Because my instructions were like...

356
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,240
You see that pile?

357
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,920
Just disassemble all of that pile.

358
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,520
You know?

359
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,160
Like I was...

360
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,980
But...

361
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,160
No.

362
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,680
I did tell her to like...

363
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,320
Do the disassembling...

364
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,140
In my office.

365
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,440
And then...

366
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,120
And then she...

367
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,800
So you know I have like a bunch of boxes...

368
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,720
That I haven't unpacked yet...

369
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,640
Since I moved in here.

370
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,540
So you know...

371
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,900
She saw all those boxes...

372
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,480
Because it's like a huge pile of them...

373
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,260
On the side of the wall in my living room.

374
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,980
And she saw those boxes...

375
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,660
And she's like...

376
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,880
Oh yeah I saw all of that.

377
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,060
Do you want me to unpack those for you too?

378
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,580
And I said no.

379
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,780
Because I...

380
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,100
Because I was like...

381
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,580
If she does that...

382
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,100
I don't know how long she'll be here for.

383
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,940
I have no idea how long she was gonna be there for.

384
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,520
And also like...

385
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,700
I'm moving soon?

386
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,280
Maybe.

387
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,700
Or I stay here a little longer.

388
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,300
I don't know.

389
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,880
But my lease is almost up.

390
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,300
And I'm keeping those boxes packed up.

391
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,220
So I can keep them packed up...

392
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,540
In my next place.

393
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,560
That I'm moving to.

394
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,080
It's gonna stay packed up.

395
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,480
Until I finally own a house.

396
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,180
Or some shit.

397
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

398
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,460
I don't know.

399
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,680
Whenever I'm unpacking that...

400
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,120
Giant pile of mess.

401
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,400
Anyway.

402
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,200
So yeah.

403
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,220
So like...

404
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,980
And then like...

405
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,580
Okay and I had some like...

406
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,340
And I told her.

407
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,780
She was like...

408
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,920
Can I make your bed too?

409
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,900
Because obviously you know...

410
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,820
I just woke up.

411
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,040
And the bed was just like...

412
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,940
A fucking hazard.

413
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,860
A hazard already.

414
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,980
And then I was like...

415
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,200
No no.

416
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,760
It's okay.

417
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,700
And then she still made my bed.

418
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,020
She's like...

419
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,500
Are you sure?

420
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:06,980
And I was like...

421
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,240
Yeah yeah.

422
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm sure.

423
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,800
Then like you know...

424
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,440
The office is clean.

425
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,220
So I went back to the office to do some work stuff.

426
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,280
And then...

427
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,660
I went back to my bedroom.

428
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,580
And then she still...

429
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,280
She made my bed.

430
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,940
I was like...

431
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,260
So surprised.

432
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,160
Oh you don't have to.

433
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,060
I said you don't have to.

434
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,720
And she still did it.

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I think she was like...

436
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,420
You know...

437
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,100
Worried for me.

438
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,080
I don't know.

439
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,680
She might have been like...

440
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,240
Concerned about my lifestyle.

441
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,420
Or something.

442
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,800
Because like...

443
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,380
I had to...

444
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,860
Because I was very surprised with...

445
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,240
With how...

446
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,020
With what she...

447
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,220
With everything in general.

448
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,660
And so...

449
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,220
Thank you.

450
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,620
You are a baby.

451
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,600
Oh yeah.

452
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,460
But the funniest shit is that...

453
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,340
So she put...

454
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,960
So like...

455
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
Dad has like wet food.

456
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,140
Because of his kidneys issues.

457
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,320
So like he has like a specialized...

458
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,780
Like wet food for his diet.

459
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,900
And then so...

460
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,040
What like...

461
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,560
Like...

462
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,540
He found her weakness.

463
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,280
Like not...

464
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,200
So not her weakness.

465
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,480
He found a weak point.

466
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,140
Like...

467
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,820
Where we all let our guard down.

468
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,840
She like put the wet...

469
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,560
The dog food.

470
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,260
Because I can only...

471
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,780
It was a big can of food.

472
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
So I can only feed it like...

473
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,520
I can only feed like...

474
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
Half a can...

475
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,860
Per meal.

476
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,060
So obviously I have to keep the can open.

477
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,100
For like dinner time.

478
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,460
And then...

479
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,200
She was cleaning the...

480
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,640
Desk.

481
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
And then she put the can...

482
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,720
On the ground.

483
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,900
And that fucker...

484
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,580
Like...

485
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,400
Bolted.

486
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,940
He's like...

487
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,240
This is my chance!

488
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,300
And he like...

489
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:44,940
Bolted.

490
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,420
And he's like...

491
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,500
And then stuck his entire face...

492
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,280
Into the can.

493
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,900
He's like...

494
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,120
No, I can't reseal it.

495
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,760
Because it's a fucking can.

496
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,860
I just threw like...

497
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,560
Look, it's like...

498
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,720
Those pop cans.

499
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,960
Like it's not a can opener.

500
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
It's like those like...

501
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,220
You know, like a Coke can.

502
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,820
You go...

503
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,380
Like that.

504
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,360
So like...

505
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,120
So like...

506
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,920
She put the can...

507
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,440
On the ground.

508
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
And he's like...

509
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,900
And he's like...

510
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
And his entire nose...

511
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,020
His entire fucking face...

512
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,920
Was just like...

513
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,040
In the can like...

514
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,580
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

515
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,940
And luckily...

516
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,200
His nose wasn't long enough...

517
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,700
To eat the entire thing.

518
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,520
Thank fucking god.

519
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,740
Just...

520
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,380
Thank god.

521
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,700
His nose...

522
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,940
Okay, I'll illustrate...

523
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
What I saw...

524
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,320
Today.

525
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,080
Alright.

526
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,880
I'll illustrate for you guys.

527
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,620
Give me a sec.

528
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,660
Let me draw this.

529
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,000
And then like...

530
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,120
This is his face.

531
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,780
And then he was just like...

532
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,460
You don't even see the eyes.

533
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
That's how fucked up it was.

534
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,460
You don't even see the eyes.

535
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,500
Like...

536
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,740
Because he was in so deep.

537
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:04,960
Okay, here.

538
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,620
And then he's like...

539
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,420
Yum, yum, yum.

540
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,260
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

541
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,360
Yum.

542
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,700
And yeah.

543
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,480
I like instantly went over.

544
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,500
Like I don't know how much he fucking was able to eat from that can.

545
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,300
But I instantly went over and like...

546
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,000
Grab...

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,980
Grab the rest of it away from him.

548
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,960
Before he could finish his fucking dinner.

549
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,600
Because I am not opening another can.

550
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,120
I have a system.

551
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,200
If I...

552
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,000
If I open another can, he ruins the system.

553
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,440
And then I'll have to keep that half a can the next day every time.

554
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,180
Alright.

555
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,400
So this is what he looked like.

556
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,320
Basically.

557
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,700
Like...

558
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,620
He was like...

559
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,400
But yeah.

560
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:57,960
Like...

561
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,720
You can't even...

562
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,080
Like I...

563
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,580
You don't even see the eyes.

564
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,140
No, it's like a Coke can.

565
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,860
So like...

566
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,240
It's like those type of cans.

567
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,340
So he can't like...

568
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,760
He can't like hurt himself because there's no edges.

569
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,260
It's like the pot...

570
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,760
It's like a popping open type of Coke can type shit.

571
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,900
So it's not like I'm using a can opener.

572
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,080
So there's no like actual sharp edges.

573
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:18,740
But yeah.

574
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:18,980
No.

575
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,800
He couldn't even...

576
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,460
Thank God it was a tall can.

577
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,820
So like...

578
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,360
He couldn't get to the end of it.

579
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,100
Because...

580
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,760
And there was still some remaining dog food in there.

581
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,540
So thank God.

582
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,280
Um...

583
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,180
You activated the cleaner's motherly instinct.

584
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,820
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

585
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,200
Thank you.

586
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,800
Thank you.

587
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,480
Medi, thank you for the super chat.

588
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:36,840
Thank you.

589
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,280
Thank you.

590
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,040
This girl needs help.

591
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,560
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

592
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:40,840
Thank you.

593
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,440
Thank you.

594
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,340
Damn, girl.

595
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,240
You live like this.

596
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
But ironically...

597
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,160
Thank you for the super chat.

598
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,640
Thank you.

599
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,200
Thank you.

600
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,680
Thank you.

601
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,980
You're still a peak artist.

602
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,360
Thank you for the super chat, Anton.

603
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:51,920
Thank you.

604
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,640
Thank you.

605
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,200
But yeah.

606
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,220
But yeah, that's basically how the day's been.

607
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,220
I was literally just sitting there.

608
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,220
Like, I guess I... when she was done with the office, I went to do some work stuff.

609
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,240
To do some work stuff to, you know, pass the time.

610
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,540
You know, to pass the time and stuff like that.

611
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,900
Uh... what else can I talk about?

612
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,660
About the cleaner?

613
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,060
Uh... I mean, my cleaner did move my monitors around.

614
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
And, like, that, like, fucked with me a little bit.

615
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,880
Because, like... like, I get... I'm very anal about my monitor position.

616
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,320
So, like, I spent, like... I just spent, like, 15 minutes just trying to, like...

617
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,200
Uh... rearrange my monitor to, like, be similar to what it was before.

618
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,100
Um... I have no idea how... like, I don't know.

619
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,760
Like, I get so anal about that shit.

620
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,720
Because, you know, like, when they move it just a little bit...

621
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,620
And everything just feels off.

622
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,540
Like...

623
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
That's how I feel.

624
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,020
Uh, JL!

625
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,900
Thank you to the super chat!

626
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,200
Thank you!

627
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:57,820
Thank you!

628
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,560
Thank you to the super chat!

629
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:00,880
Thank you!

630
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,500
Thank you!

631
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,720
Uh...

632
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,380
But, yeah, she was, like... she was a really nice cleaner.

633
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,900
Um... I literally... Jim Lee did not expect the amount of effort she put through...

634
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,920
She put in for the day.

635
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,540
I gave her a $20 tip.

636
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,740
Because, like...

637
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,360
Um... usually...

638
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,140
Because I usually don't...

639
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,400
Don't...

640
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,240
Have small bills on me.

641
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,280
Um...

642
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,640
I usually don't have small bills on me or anything.

643
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,580
Uh...

644
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,440
But I did have a $20 lying around on the table.

645
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,040
So, I was like, you know what?

646
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
You know, she deserves...

647
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
She deserves this tip.

648
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,140
And it wasn't even, like...

649
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,560
It was, like, $180 for four hours.

650
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,480
And honestly, like, with the amount...

651
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,240
For, like...

652
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,520
Um...

653
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:36,980
Per month.

654
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,660
Usually...

655
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,500
Usually my...

656
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Uh...

657
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,560
Cleaning bill per month is, like, $140 for three hours.

658
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,200
Like, for three hours.

659
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,540
And it's, like, once a month.

660
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,600
Um...

661
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,800
But this time, she, you know, she stayed for an extra hour.

662
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,020
Because it's usually...

663
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,820
It's, like, three...

664
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,180
It's, like, three...

665
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,440
They...

666
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,980
My older...

667
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,360
Other cleaning takes, like, three hours.

668
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,180
Um...

669
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,420
And Canadian, by the way.

670
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,220
I think it's, like...

671
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,160
It's usually...

672
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,500
Canadian...

673
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,440
And it's Canadian dollars.

674
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,460
So, it's a lot cheaper than American.

675
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,220
But I felt like it was such a good deal.

676
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,600
And, you know, she did a lot.

677
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,060
And, um, and... No, the reason why I don't carry small bills is because I just use card.

678
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,040
I... And, like, all my big bills were from, like, Licey.

679
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,640
Were from red pocket money.

680
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,980
So, like, I was, like, you know, I have, like, a collection of, like, red pocket money in my wallet that I got.

681
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,600
Like, and I just, you know, and they're all, like, big bills.

682
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,920
And that's, like, literally, um, why I have even big bill money.

683
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,320
And, you know, I...

684
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,700
I have... I just keep... I don't use them.

685
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,800
I don't use my... I don't use, like, actual, like, paper money.

686
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,040
Um, so I just keep it in my wallet for, like, emergencies.

687
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:55,760
Like, uh, so I keep, like, like, four or five red pockets in my wallet for, like, emergencies in case I do need paper money.

688
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,960
Um, so I mostly just use card for, like, I always just use card for everything or Apple Pay.

689
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,760
Like, legitimately just poop.

690
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,620
Like, it's just so convenient.

691
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,400
I... there's no reason.

692
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:16,140
It's not like I... it's not like I, like, am at a gas station and then my card get fucking swiped by a card eater or something.

693
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,540
Like, I'm not at a gas station.

694
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,720
I'm at a fucking restaurant.

695
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,680
So I'm just gonna boop and then that's it.

696
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,260
Um, most of the time I spend money...

697
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,840
It's just on, like, you know, a reputable store that I think won't steal my information.

698
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,960
So...

699
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,340
So...

700
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,600
So...

701
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,500
I assume that I am at a place that doesn't have a...

702
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,540
have a fucking fake card insert that's gonna steal my money.

703
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,800
Like, that's what I hope I'm at.

704
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
So that's why I mostly just use...

705
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,360
um, just use my card and not cash money.

706
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,740
Um, anyway.

707
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,480
I will be right back, guys.

708
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,620
Also, before I be right...

709
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,020
because I need to get gamer stuff because I am so tired.

710
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,820
My brain is taking 20 years to, like, boot up right now and to think.

711
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,160
Uh, because of how tired I am at the moment.

712
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,100
Uh, Gumbetto!

713
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
But before I go, Gumbetto, thank you for the super chat.

714
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,300
Thank you, thank you.

715
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,620
Uh, hi, Doki.

716
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,760
Today is my birthday!

717
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,820
Thank you for bringing so much laughter to my life!

718
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,840
Happy birthday!

719
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,140
Happy birthday to you.

720
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Happy birthday to you.

721
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,980
Happy birthday, dear Gumbetto.

722
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,080
Happy birthday to you.

723
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,680
Yeah!

724
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,100
Yay!

725
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,020
Yay!

726
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,660
Alright, give me a sec.

727
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,540
I'm gonna get some gamer subs real quick.

728
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Because I am tired.

729
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,180
Sorry, I need to...

730
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,780
I, I, like, lowered the volume, but forgot what the volume was.

731
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,780
So here's, like, random dad for...

732
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,940
Alright, I'll be right back.

733
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,620
Alright, I'm back.

734
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,500
I have to...

735
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:58,780
Ugh!

736
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,780
Gamer subs.

737
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,960
So, I hope I can finish the game this week.

738
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,820
Because I did say on street...

739
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,260
On my schedule that I am finishing the game this week.

740
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,420
So, yeah.

741
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,360
I know I did say I was gonna give you guys picture updates for, like...

742
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,980
All the stuff.

743
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,960
Like, dad updates and all that shit.

744
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,560
I know I...

745
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,820
I was like, oh, I'm gonna give you picture updates of a bunch of things.

746
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,660
I honestly forgot what I was supposed to show you guys.

747
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,280
But we're many, crush.

748
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,140
Thank you for the super chat.

749
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,400
Thank you.

750
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:27,920
Thank you.

751
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,100
Seiji, thank you for the super chat.

752
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,380
Thank you.

753
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,820
Thank you.

754
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,540
Welcome back.

755
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,480
I...

756
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,280
I forgot what...

757
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I remember I was like...

758
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,760
Oh, yeah.

759
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm gonna show you guys pictures and stuff.

760
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,800
But I legitimately forgot, like, what pictures are...

761
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,300
Oh, yeah!

762
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:39,720
Okay.

763
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Let me write it down.

764
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,140
I didn't write it down, guys.

765
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,940
So, that was the issue.

766
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,720
Usually, I write stuff down when I was like...

767
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
I'm gonna show this to stream.

768
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,200
Okay.

769
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,820
Sand stuff.

770
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
Uh, dad pictures.

771
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,400
And...

772
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,940
What was it?

773
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,580
Uh...

774
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,200
Uh, the t-shirt.

775
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,740
Okay, the t-shirt.

776
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,100
Alright.

777
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,620
Alright, okay.

778
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,420
Yeah, because I was like, oh yeah, I'll show you guys.

779
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,360
Um, I'll show it to you guys during, like, the Mario month, but, like, I didn't have time.

780
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,100
I didn't have time to gather everything.

781
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,760
I've been so busy.

782
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,860
I've been so busy every day.

783
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,400
Oh my gosh.

784
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,660
Like, if I'm not sleeping, I'm working lately.

785
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,360
Hmm.

786
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,760
You're in the game volume down?

787
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,500
Yeah, no problem.

788
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,840
Uh, let me see.

789
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,140
Uh, there we go.

790
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,920
Alright, is that better, guys?

791
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,560
I turned the volume down a little bit.

792
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,140
Um, what flavor don't you wanna know?

793
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,640
He-he.

794
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,010
I'll never tell.

795
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:47,910
So, make you guys buy multiple Gamersub tubs using my code.

796
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,470
Bite Size!

797
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,250
Thank you for the Super Chat.

798
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:53,630
Thank you.

799
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,330
Thank you.

800
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,570
Papa Smerd.

801
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,410
Thank you for the Super Chat.

802
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:56,790
Thank you.

803
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,410
Thank you.

804
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,190
What percentage of your cardboard box stash was due to laziness?

805
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,850
How much was due to noodle arms?

806
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,910
It can be both.

807
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,790
Why not both?

808
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,550
I'm a cleaner.

809
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,850
Who's gonna be here anyway?

810
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,830
So, like, why don't I just ask her to help me?

811
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,770
She's getting paid!

812
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,450
It's not like she's doing it for free!

813
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:21,170
Look, the thing is, if I had to do it, I'd be doing it for free, okay?

814
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,470
That's the issue.

815
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,250
But since she's here, she's getting paid anyway.

816
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,470
So, why should I do something that would have been free for myself?

817
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,810
Like, I don't pay myself.

818
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,590
You guys pay me.

819
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,650
This entire ca- This entire castle is one giant dungeon!

820
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,910
Make sure you're well stocked!

821
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,130
And healed!

822
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,610
And don't forget to take breaks!

823
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,130
Okay, I heard this is, like, a really long one, too.

824
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,490
Um, bro, Mario, you gotta come when you're not beating up my boss.

825
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,850
Actually pretty chill most of the time.

826
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,590
I have some extra healing supplies if you let me heal!

827
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,430
Okay.

828
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,650
Hey, hey, hey!

829
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,510
Isn't it hot, hot, hot?

830
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,450
You know what else is hot, hot, hot?

831
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,470
Sell, sell, sell!

832
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,010
So why don't you...

833
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,890
Bye, bye, bye!

834
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,610
Alright, do they have actual good hats?

835
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,910
No, I already have...

836
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,470
I forgot we paid you!

837
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,450
Santina, thank you for the super chat!

838
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,530
Thank you, thank you!

839
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,070
Um, Matty, thank you for the super chat!

840
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:27,790
Thank you, thank you!

841
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,450
Can I pay you ten bucks to put away the next box?

842
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,230
You guys!

843
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,530
Thank you for the super chat, Matty!

844
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,890
Thank you, thank you!

845
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,210
I'll think about it.

846
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,750
Oh, yeah, Max Zero!

847
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,650
Alright.

848
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:42,710
Let's see.

849
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,390
Current room.

850
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,690
One door to first floor.

851
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:46,630
What?

852
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,670
What does that mean?

853
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,090
Okay, so there's that entrance.

854
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:50,830
And then...

855
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,750
Current room.

856
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,690
Type to...

857
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,450
Oh, my God.

858
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,490
I'm already so confused.

859
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,650
Current room.

860
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,250
Okay, this is one, two.

861
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,210
Alright.

862
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,530
Uh...

863
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,510
Oh, I want to take a picture.

864
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,150
Yeah.

865
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:05,930
Yay!

866
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,890
Okay, so this entire area is just a maze.

867
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,570
Okay, thank God.

868
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,330
Because I was, like, thinking.

869
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,050
I was, like...

870
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,210
Am I going to be able to complete the skiing today?

871
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,750
And I was, like...

872
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,510
No, Doki.

873
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,910
If it's a maze...

874
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,670
You're going to spend your whole life in that one maze.

875
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,050
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

876
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,630
Oh, this is neat.

877
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,430
Thank you for the super chat.

878
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:30,770
Thank you.

879
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,330
Thank you.

880
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,250
Hi, Doki.

881
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,870
Can you do a favor and pick either violet, pink, or green?

882
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,270
Uh...

883
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,230
Violet.

884
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,870
Or Bowser may be evil.

885
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,770
Leo's the hardest of ragers I have ever seen.

886
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,390
Comment suggested to Bowser an open cause of catching.

887
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,410
And cannot let go of that idea for the rest of the castle.

888
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,410
All right, I guess...

889
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,450
Can I go through the main door?

890
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,870
Okay, no.

891
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,170
Okay, I'll just go through...

892
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:56,590
You know what?

893
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,830
I'll go through this one.

894
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,530
I'll go to the second floor first.

895
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,830
Can't be that bad.

896
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,410
Okay.

897
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,370
Bite me.

898
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,550
I need to level up.

899
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,610
You're in a war...

900
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,950
For a world of pain.

901
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,350
You got the...

902
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,890
Yeah, but I want to know if there's any mons I haven't caught yet.

903
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,010
Is it, like, used up now?

904
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,570
Is, like, my repel active...

905
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:19,970
What the...

906
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,950
I keep forgetting your...

907
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,970
I keep forgetting your hair.

908
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,970
I was like...

909
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,510
What are you doing?

910
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,390
Rice, get back in there.

911
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,430
Smug!

912
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,930
Death, thank you for the super chat.

913
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:33,270
Thank you.

914
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:33,930
Thank you.

915
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,050
All right.

916
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,090
Is the...

917
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,590
Is the infinite repel, like, on right now?

918
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,190
Or, like, do I have to activate it?

919
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,410
Because I do want to...

920
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,630
Yeah, Rice is not meant to fight.

921
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,250
They're just there to look pretty.

922
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,230
Okay, so I can look around and see if I have any I need to catch first.

923
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,410
Oh shit, no, that's a fire.

924
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,970
All right.

925
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,350
Fuck.

926
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,310
Okay, that's awkward.

927
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,010
You're just there to look pretty on my team.

928
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,690
You're like the...

929
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,730
You have pretty privilege.

930
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,330
Okay, that's good.

931
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:12,850
Okay.

932
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,350
Let's get that...

933
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,870
Uh, it did that much damage.

934
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,670
You're just like a panda.

935
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,190
Pandas would have been extinct if...

936
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,390
They weren't so cute.

937
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,940
Nice.

938
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,400
Okay.

939
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,800
Like, you basically got in via sheer nepotism because of pretty privilege.

940
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,080
All right.

941
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,700
Let's see.

942
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,120
All right.

943
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,160
Dad back up here.

944
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,000
True.

945
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,480
You told us already multiple times?

946
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,020
Yes!

947
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,100
Because it's...

948
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,740
I need to make a statement!

949
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,920
Oh shit.

950
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
That's not the cap I wanted to throw.

951
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,200
All right.

952
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,240
Oh, it's the wix.

953
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,220
Oh, never mind.

954
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,900
I'm gonna stay winning, baby.

955
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,360
I don't hate pandas.

956
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,160
I just think that...

957
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,200
The reason why they're hopeless right now...

958
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,060
The reason why...

959
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,900
They can't do anything for themselves...

960
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,820
Is that we might have, like...

961
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,300
Made them like that and kept it...

962
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,780
Okay.

963
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,080
Nice.

964
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:31,620
Yay!

965
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,100
All right.

966
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,240
Who wants to be a hammer, bro?

967
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,120
Alana, thank you for the raid.

968
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,620
Thank you.

969
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,080
Thank you.

970
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,120
Welcome, everybody.

971
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,580
Apparently, like...

972
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,440
Pandas can actually eat something else other than bamboo...

973
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,680
But they just choose not to.

974
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,400
Like, how fucking stupid...

975
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,600
All right.

976
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,080
A bro that can adapt to almost any combat situation...

977
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,620
With its knowledge of different projectiles.

978
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,520
A group of it is called a frat.

979
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,980
And it's very annoying.

980
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,940
All right.

981
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,840
I mean...

982
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,220
Do you really know?

983
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,420
Like...

984
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,320
Them eating bamboo is literally just a choice.

985
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,160
They can, like, actually...

986
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,600
Like, stomachs can actually eat anything else.

987
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,440
It's like when koalas...

988
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,340
Can try and eat anything else...

989
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,020
But then they just choose to be high.

990
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,160
They just choose to be high all the time.

991
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,000
All right.

992
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,040
Okay, lost.

993
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,940
I'll give you...

994
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,000
I'll give you a hammer, bro.

995
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Okay, lost.

996
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,200
Lost.

997
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,460
Goon.

998
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,840
All right.

999
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,220
Nice.

1000
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,730
What's that?

1001
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,650
Can I open that door?

1002
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,030
Oh, I don't have to put out trooper.

1003
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,250
Oh, my God.

1004
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,430
I'm, like, kidnapping all his minions.

1005
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,210
Like, are they...

1006
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,930
I don't know if I'm...

1007
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,370
Yay!

1008
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,150
My prisoner of war.

1009
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,810
For legal reasons...

1010
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,150
That's a joke, guys.

1011
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,510
For legal reasons...

1012
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,870
That's a joke.

1013
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,030
A flying turtle with angel-like wings...

1014
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,970
Is often enlisted as a common foot soldier.

1015
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,750
It follows a marching pattern.

1016
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,970
Determined by the color of its shell.

1017
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,630
All right.

1018
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,350
Who wants to be my prisoner?

1019
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,570
It was not a joke.

1020
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,090
He...

1021
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,710
He still has a family.

1022
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,570
Just...

1023
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,770
He can't see them anymore.

1024
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,910
That's different.

1025
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,550
Like...

1026
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,570
That's different.

1027
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,150
He just can't see his family.

1028
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,310
He lives in my box for the rest of his life.

1029
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,770
Uh, Mr. Broken Bond.

1030
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1031
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,110
Thank you.

1032
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,770
Thank you.

1033
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,650
You and Panda share a lot of qualities.

1034
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,430
Like poor diet.

1035
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,450
Unable to clean after yourself.

1036
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,470
And can't build anything.

1037
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,130
Yes.

1038
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,990
And you guys enabled me.

1039
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,650
That's right.

1040
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,570
That's my pretty privilege.

1041
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,350
And you're the suit keepers.

1042
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,910
That are making sure I don't go extinct.

1043
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,490
That's right.

1044
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,650
I'm owning my pretty privilege.

1045
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,770
I...

1046
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,850
I won't leave the problem.

1047
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,290
Okay.

1048
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,210
All right.

1049
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,250
Who wants to be my prisoner of war?

1050
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,430
Who...

1051
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,010
Okay.

1052
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,070
Wait.

1053
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,090
DJ, do you have...

1054
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,450
Does DJ have one already?

1055
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,470
DJ...

1056
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,630
Goon.

1057
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:46,990
All right.

1058
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,610
It's fine.

1059
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,050
I'll rename it if he does.

1060
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,790
Here's the baboose.

1061
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,550
Thank you.

1062
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,250
Thank you for the super chat, Mehdi.

1063
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,750
Thank you.

1064
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,430
Thank you.

1065
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,430
Wait.

1066
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,490
How would he...

1067
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,670
Shoot that?

1068
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,190
What?

1069
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,610
It says...

1070
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,890
It's whole as a bullet.

1071
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,290
But how would it...

1072
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:07,910
Shoot it?

1073
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:08,890
I don't know.

1074
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,630
I don't fucking...

1075
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:09,750
Wait.

1076
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,870
Actually, let me read this.

1077
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:11,550
Whoops.

1078
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,490
Looking at Doki like Oppenheim.

1079
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,010
We...

1080
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,170
We created this.

1081
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,210
Thank you for the super chat.

1082
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,590
Thank you.

1083
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,310
Thank you.

1084
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:21,690
Johnny.

1085
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,810
Thank you for the super chat.

1086
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:23,130
Thank you.

1087
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:23,550
Thank you.

1088
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,850
I can't believe it.

1089
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,550
We're enabling her.

1090
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,790
We're the reason she survives off of...

1091
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,410
I am a gamer sub to take out.

1092
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,450
Look.

1093
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,170
Look.

1094
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,110
It's an endless...

1095
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,210
It's an endless circle.

1096
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,130
Guys.

1097
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,850
And I feed you.

1098
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,730
You feed me.

1099
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,010
Oh, shit.

1100
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:43,450
Okay.

1101
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:43,950
It's fine.

1102
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,530
I got away safely.

1103
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,650
Okay.

1104
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,310
I think Dad can take him on.

1105
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,170
Like, he might be like...

1106
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,210
At...

1107
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,610
At the brink of death.

1108
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,410
But like...

1109
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,450
I believe in him.

1110
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,810
As long as he's faster.

1111
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,770
He is faster, right?

1112
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,590
As long...

1113
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,330
As long as you're faster.

1114
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,210
Oh, thank God.

1115
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:04,550
Okay.

1116
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,450
Okay.

1117
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,010
Thank God.

1118
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,350
Okay.

1119
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,050
We made it.

1120
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,550
Let's go gambling.

1121
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,090
Gambling.

1122
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1123
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,510
Thank you.

1124
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,110
Thank you.

1125
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,870
There's an Uber Eats meal down into the enclosure.

1126
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:21,910
Yeah.

1127
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,730
I did it.

1128
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,010
Oh, but he like blocked my only fucking...

1129
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:33,130
Okay.

1130
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,450
I need to go back and heal though.

1131
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,290
Oh, I don't have a Goomba stack.

1132
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:38,790
Oh my God.

1133
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,050
Nice.

1134
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:39,330
Okay.

1135
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,550
I can basically catch all the ones that I haven't got.

1136
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,530
Alright.

1137
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,510
Who wants to be this pathetic...

1138
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,490
Uh...

1139
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,890
Pathetic stack of enemies.

1140
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,710
Like, it's sad.

1141
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,490
It's like, yeah.

1142
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,030
One Goomba is sad.

1143
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,030
But now there's like five of you.

1144
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,590
Now it's just five sad people together.

1145
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,810
I'm pathetic.

1146
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,270
That's me.

1147
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,010
Like, it doesn't change anything.

1148
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,730
All I have to do is just step one.

1149
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,870
Alright.

1150
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:10,270
Nice.

1151
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,950
Alright.

1152
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,670
A stack of Goombas.

1153
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,730
They join forces like this to impress mates.

1154
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,950
But not without fighting over.

1155
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,870
Which gets...

1156
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,470
What gets to be on...

1157
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,070
What?

1158
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:26,670
What?

1159
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,770
Which one gets to be on top?

1160
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:33,590
And...

1161
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:33,870
What?

1162
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,490
Wouldn't...

1163
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:34,890
Okay.

1164
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,750
But like...

1165
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,270
Okay.

1166
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,450
But...

1167
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,890
Wouldn't the person at the bottom have the most fun?

1168
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,750
Wouldn't you...

1169
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,690
Wouldn't you want to be at...

1170
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,570
I don't understand.

1171
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,630
Why would you want to be at the top?

1172
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,090
What do you get out of it?

1173
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,410
If you squint really hard, you might be able to see her.

1174
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,010
Like, does he look like his ass?

1175
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,030
Like, I'm just saying...

1176
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,750
Like, what does he get out of it?

1177
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,170
By being at the top?

1178
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,690
But it's to impress mates.

1179
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,650
They're trying to be like, you know...

1180
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,710
All the short kings.

1181
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,530
All the short kings get together and be like...

1182
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,910
If we all like climb on top of each other...

1183
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,170
And wear a very, very long coat...

1184
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,090
Then like...

1185
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,630
Then the ladies won't swipe left on us.

1186
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,550
Like...

1187
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,710
I'm the top.

1188
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,830
That's me.

1189
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,290
Why should I think it was a super chat that you're thinking?

1190
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,410
Unless like...

1191
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,910
No, don't think about it like that.

1192
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,730
No, I shouldn't finish the question.

1193
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:44,410
All right.

1194
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,190
All right.

1195
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,790
Okay, I'll choose four dragons...

1196
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,270
To be the Goomba stack.

1197
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,650
And you guys can decide who's on top.

1198
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,230
All right.

1199
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,310
Unless...

1200
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,330
Unless, you know...

1201
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,290
Unless...

1202
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,250
You know...

1203
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,590
The top part does get all the action.

1204
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,070
Like...

1205
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,390
Rice, thank you for the super chat.

1206
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:13,950
Thank you.

1207
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:14,710
Thank you.

1208
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,150
Nextie, thank you for the super chat.

1209
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,570
Thank you.

1210
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:18,330
Thank you.

1211
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,470
Who wants to be...

1212
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,170
Okay.

1213
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:24,770
Okay.

1214
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,750
Who wants to be the bottom?

1215
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,290
Okay.

1216
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,690
Who...

1217
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,090
All right.

1218
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,670
Who wants...

1219
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1220
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,130
Thank you.

1221
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:35,830
Thank you.

1222
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:36,610
Okay.

1223
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,570
I saw...

1224
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,850
Kepan wants to be...

1225
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,470
Okay.

1226
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,850
We need two more.

1227
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,190
We need two more.

1228
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,850
Look, there's not enough...

1229
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,030
Oh, I can't even.

1230
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:51,470
Okay.

1231
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:52,410
All right.

1232
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,750
There's like not enough room.

1233
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,510
I just realized.

1234
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,030
All right.

1235
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:55,650
You're just...

1236
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,490
You just get initials, guys.

1237
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,190
There's not enough room.

1238
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,150
Um...

1239
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,630
H...

1240
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,710
K...

1241
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,850
You know who you are.

1242
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:04,870
H...

1243
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:05,810
K...

1244
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:06,410
Uh...

1245
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,890
You guys each get one letter.

1246
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,150
G...

1247
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:09,970
For...

1248
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,770
Grumple.

1249
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,550
And then one more letter, guys.

1250
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,330
H...

1251
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:15,750
K...

1252
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,730
G...

1253
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,510
All right.

1254
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,570
A.

1255
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,330
I don't know...

1256
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:20,470
Wait.

1257
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,550
Can we make a name?

1258
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:22,430
Oh, wait.

1259
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,710
Let's see.

1260
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,770
We can make a name out of this.

1261
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:27,830
K...

1262
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,450
H...

1263
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:28,870
A...

1264
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:29,530
G...

1265
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,990
K...

1266
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,470
A...

1267
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,150
K...

1268
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,350
H...

1269
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:34,530
A...

1270
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:34,770
G...

1271
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,030
Okay.

1272
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,010
H...

1273
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,890
A...

1274
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:38,090
Hag?

1275
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:39,990
H...

1276
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,130
H...

1277
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:40,310
A...

1278
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:43,190
H...

1279
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,030
Hag...

1280
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,590
K...

1281
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,070
Okay.

1282
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,370
Okay.

1283
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,170
Goood.

1284
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,970
You guys can decide who's the top and who's the bottom.

1285
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,070
Oh, Kingdom Hearts Hag?

1286
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,270
Yeah, let's do that, actually.

1287
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:55,490
Wait.

1288
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,210
That's actually good.

1289
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,030
He...

1290
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,290
I like that.

1291
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,210
Kingdom Hearts Hag.

1292
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:04,230
Okay.

1293
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,090
Kingdom Hearts Hag.

1294
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,610
All right.

1295
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:11,910
Goon.

1296
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,710
Here we go.

1297
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,470
Tagoon.

1298
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:15,950
All right.

1299
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,690
All right.

1300
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,910
You guys figure out who's the top and who's the bottom.

1301
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,400
I need to heal myself real quick.

1302
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,280
All right.

1303
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,320
Let's go back in.

1304
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:35,940
Bum.

1305
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,300
Bum.

1306
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,280
Bum.

1307
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:40,400
Bum.

1308
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,600
Bum.

1309
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:41,980
Can I go...

1310
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,820
Can I swim through lava?

1311
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,100
Oh, my God.

1312
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:48,660
Stop!

1313
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,360
All you do is just die anyway.

1314
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,580
Let me go.

1315
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,400
Leave.

1316
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,980
Leave me.

1317
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,180
Oh, my God.

1318
00:46:59,260 --> 00:46:59,760
That's it.

1319
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,740
I'm going to sit on him.

1320
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,540
That's it.

1321
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,420
I'm angry now.

1322
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,470
Get over here.

1323
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,610
I don't think I actually need the XP.

1324
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,470
I mean, like...

1325
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,950
I feel like my guy's already...

1326
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,750
Dad's already overpowered as hell.

1327
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,100
Hmm.

1328
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:23,760
Yay!

1329
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,660
Okay.

1330
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,160
Can I...

1331
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,780
No, I can't.

1332
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,080
Okay.

1333
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,060
That's good to know.

1334
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,760
Wait, what's...

1335
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,660
Did I miss something over there?

1336
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,280
No.

1337
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,280
Bum.

1338
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,260
Bum.

1339
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,960
Wait, what?

1340
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:41,210
Okay.

1341
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,130
So, I can't do anything here.

1342
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,330
Okay.

1343
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,830
So, I have to leave here anyway.

1344
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,450
All right.

1345
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,630
We go this way.

1346
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,670
We're at this room now.

1347
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,010
God, this place is so confusing already.

1348
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,530
I...

1349
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,310
I'm already so...

1350
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,910
How is he so slow?

1351
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:02,530
Like...

1352
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:02,990
What?

1353
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,010
Okay, I need to know what's...

1354
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,810
What's his speed.

1355
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,210
I...

1356
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:05,990
I need to know.

1357
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,390
I need to know what the fuck is the speed.

1358
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:11,590
All right.

1359
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,250
Sit on him.

1360
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:12,650
Because he...

1361
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,610
They won't leave me alone.

1362
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,750
It's almost like it's a maze, Joki.

1363
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,590
Wow.

1364
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,570
It's very maze-like, isn't it?

1365
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,350
All right.

1366
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,090
What's your speed?

1367
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,170
Like, how bad is it?

1368
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,060
It's not even that bad.

1369
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,840
Oh my god.

1370
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,740
My special defense.

1371
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,520
Oh.

1372
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,100
Oh.

1373
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,700
I mean, like...

1374
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,180
Yoshi has less speed.

1375
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,640
Okay, but he is less speed.

1376
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,780
Oh my god.

1377
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,320
He's so fucking buffed up.

1378
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,440
And then...

1379
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,840
The other guy is just average.

1380
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,660
Oh, you guys can't see it?

1381
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:48,980
Oh.

1382
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:49,300
Okay.

1383
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,740
There.

1384
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,640
It's like...

1385
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,920
It is his weakest stat.

1386
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,580
Oh my god.

1387
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,360
My attack is so fucking crazy.

1388
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,440
No wonder I'm one-shotting everything.

1389
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:58,740
Mother.

1390
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,060
All right.

1391
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,800
Get over here.

1392
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,520
You're not going anywhere, Mario.

1393
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,140
Yeah, that is pretty fucking strong.

1394
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,300
I mean, look at...

1395
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,820
Okay, look.

1396
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,620
There's a reason why he's so slow.

1397
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,860
Okay, look at him, guys.

1398
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,460
He's fucking built like a unit right now.

1399
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,400
It's not his fault.

1400
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,860
And he's just big boned, okay?

1401
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,860
He's big boned.

1402
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,420
It's just all muscle.

1403
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,560
I swear to god.

1404
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,120
It's all muscle, guys.

1405
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:43,860
All right.

1406
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,420
Sit.

1407
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,020
Yeah.

1408
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,820
Big boy.

1409
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,040
Big boy.

1410
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,900
Big boy making big plans.

1411
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,220
Yarrg.

1412
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:01,760
Okay.

1413
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,220
I'll just throw him.

1414
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,620
Throw him!

1415
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,240
Throw him back into the lava where he belongs.

1416
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,580
Oh, shit.

1417
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,940
That's fine.

1418
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,020
That doesn't do that much damage.

1419
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,840
Yeah!

1420
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,280
Easy.

1421
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,640
Unless we only use our captures.

1422
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,320
All right.

1423
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,340
Oh my gosh, I'm so lost.

1424
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,900
I'm here doing a safety audit.

1425
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,920
And on the castle, I can stay with almost certainty that's too hot and too scary.

1426
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,920
Okay, clearly I should go this way, right?

1427
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:50,390
Okay.

1428
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,650
I already have him.

1429
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,430
Guys, have I got all the captures in this castle?

1430
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,210
Or like, is there some that...

1431
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,730
Is there anyone that I haven't got yet?

1432
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,950
All these doors don't make moving around the castle any easier.

1433
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:05,570
Whoever designed this really must be fun and want to see everyone suffer.

1434
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,450
Oh, okay.

1435
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,310
He doesn't want to fight me.

1436
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:08,590
That's good.

1437
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,110
They're spread across different rooms?

1438
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,110
Oh, okay.

1439
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,170
So there's some that I have yet to see.

1440
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:18,930
All right.

1441
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,010
Okay, I'm back here.

1442
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,170
Okay, that's not...

1443
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:23,010
That's not it.

1444
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,690
Oh, boy.

1445
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,230
I can't wait to start my journey in the cat challenge.

1446
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,410
I hope I can get all power...

1447
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,650
Eight power stars before anyone else's.

1448
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,650
Hey, Mario.

1449
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,110
How many do you have?

1450
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,670
You have seven above to get your eighth?

1451
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:37,310
Wow.

1452
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,570
That's fantastic.

1453
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,110
Thanks for telling me.

1454
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,170
I'm going to quit before I get too infested.

1455
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,170
Good for you.

1456
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,970
Know your place, little guy.

1457
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,770
There's a reason why you don't have a name and I do.

1458
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,590
Some people were just born to not be special.

1459
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,010
Just like you, little man.

1460
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:57,490
Whoa.

1461
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:58,730
What?

1462
00:51:59,150 --> 00:51:59,870
Bro.

1463
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,410
Some people were just meant to be an NPC in your story.

1464
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,250
Oh, so rude.

1465
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,490
Did I scare you?

1466
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,110
Please just let him have this one.

1467
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,530
Not even good enough to be my prisoner.

1468
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,330
Under a war.

1469
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,010
So sad.

1470
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,490
Inspirational words.

1471
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,810
By Toki.

1472
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:35,010
Alright.

1473
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:35,570
Nice.

1474
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,850
I have no small bills.

1475
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,390
Bye.

1476
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,280
Oh, there he is.

1477
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:46,760
Wait.

1478
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,240
Why did he not send this one out?

1479
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,680
Oh, wait.

1480
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:48,880
No.

1481
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,040
He is just going to duplicate me.

1482
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:51,380
Okay.

1483
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:51,800
That is fine.

1484
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,560
I will just throw him.

1485
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,260
Get out of here.

1486
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,780
That is right.

1487
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,640
You think you can duplicate me?

1488
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,380
You will never be as good as the original.

1489
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:07,330
Alright.

1490
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:08,770
Where do I go?

1491
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:11,950
Alright.

1492
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,090
There is another door there.

1493
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,210
Don't get cocky because you have seven power stars.

1494
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:17,890
I will still defeat you.

1495
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,790
Who is...

1496
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,810
Who is we?

1497
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,750
I only have one son.

1498
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:26,530
Alright.

1499
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:26,810
Alright.

1500
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:27,130
Let's go.

1501
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,040
Oh, okay.

1502
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,580
Yeah.

1503
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,580
I feel like...

1504
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,620
A T-Rex might be bigger than...

1505
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,100
I don't know why I didn't think...

1506
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,540
I don't know why I didn't think he's like...

1507
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,280
Smaller...

1508
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,520
Than a fucking bomb.

1509
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,560
Okay.

1510
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,120
That's fine.

1511
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,260
I can still throw you.

1512
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:55,640
Yay!

1513
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,290
I'm sure I'm missing like...

1514
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,630
A shitload of mines too.

1515
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,550
Okay.

1516
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,630
This looks new.

1517
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,250
Guys.

1518
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,250
This looks new, guys.

1519
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,730
You have been stopped by Corporal Par...

1520
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,510
Parablong.

1521
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,350
Prepare to be beaten, silly.

1522
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,060
Okay.

1523
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,540
That's fine.

1524
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,160
See, this is why I have to over...

1525
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,580
I have to level up so...

1526
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,580
Dad so much.

1527
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,880
Because he's so fucking slow.

1528
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,180
If he's like...

1529
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,840
You know...

1530
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,860
If he's 20 levels higher than everybody else...

1531
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,440
Eventually he'll be faster.

1532
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:41,780
Right?

1533
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,560
Eventually.

1534
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,320
Oh shit.

1535
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:48,820
Never mind.

1536
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,220
Goodbye.

1537
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,000
Bye, dad.

1538
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,040
True.

1539
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,680
Oh, now he's even faster.

1540
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,100
Wow.

1541
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,520
Okay.

1542
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,140
He's already dead.

1543
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:58,880
I guess.

1544
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,520
Think.

1545
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,760
My son has an actual rock move, right?

1546
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,400
Because you're ground.

1547
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,320
Okay.

1548
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,620
This should be it.

1549
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,180
Oh, fuck.

1550
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:15,540
Okay.

1551
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,060
Never mind.

1552
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,880
Clearly I don't know.

1553
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,440
Oh, I...

1554
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,000
Sorry.

1555
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,180
I don't remember my type matchups again.

1556
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,260
I...

1557
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,580
Sorry.

1558
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,280
I forgot my type matchups again.

1559
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,660
Alright.

1560
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,180
There you go.

1561
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,060
I...

1562
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:33,940
I don't know.

1563
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,240
They're both made of rocks.

1564
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,360
I don't understand.

1565
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,720
Both of them are made of rocks.

1566
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,560
They both...

1567
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,780
It's all Earth Element.

1568
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,520
It's like air, water, fire, Earth.

1569
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,220
It's not air, water, fire, ground.

1570
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,280
Air, water, fire, rock.

1571
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:57,770
Okay.

1572
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:58,430
Meter match.

1573
00:55:58,810 --> 00:55:58,890
Okay.

1574
00:55:59,070 --> 00:55:59,470
This should work.

1575
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,390
Well, there should be.

1576
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,910
They should just get rid of ground and rock.

1577
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,350
Fuck type system.

1578
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,890
I want my Earth mood.

1579
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,390
Are you having a stroke?

1580
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,430
Okay, hammer, bro.

1581
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:18,490
Hammer, bro.

1582
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:19,730
Okay.

1583
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,690
Surely dragon will work, right?

1584
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:29,630
Go.

1585
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:30,950
Dragoon?

1586
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,390
I love the question mark.

1587
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:35,670
Alright.

1588
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,450
Let's see.

1589
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:37,890
Fuck you.

1590
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,290
Just swing your tail.

1591
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,700
Swing that tail.

1592
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,690
Oh my god.

1593
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,990
You're so fucking weak.

1594
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:51,670
Alright.

1595
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,990
Okay, that's good.

1596
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,770
That's good.

1597
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,730
We have two disappointments on this team.

1598
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:03,270
Or not.

1599
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,970
We have two disappointments in this battle.

1600
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,730
Okay, nice.

1601
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:14,790
Yay!

1602
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,950
Okay, so...

1603
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:19,910
Oh, fuck.

1604
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:20,230
Okay.

1605
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:21,650
Whoops.

1606
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,010
I got a little greedy.

1607
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,290
Go, stick bug.

1608
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:26,830
Shiny versus shiny.

1609
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:30,250
Okay, I wanted to get the bullet key.

1610
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,990
I don't know what this is.

1611
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,550
Oh, it's a key item.

1612
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:33,970
Oh!

1613
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,410
That's for that door from earlier.

1614
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:36,990
Okay.

1615
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,610
Oh, there's a mecha koopa.

1616
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:39,470
Nice.

1617
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:40,170
I needed that.

1618
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,270
I don't have one.

1619
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,190
Alright, who wants to be a mecha koopa?

1620
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:47,790
Oh, never mind.

1621
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:48,210
Not yet.

1622
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,070
Get stick bug.

1623
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:53,810
Bye, stick bug.

1624
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:55,430
Holy fuck.

1625
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,890
Okay.

1626
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,700
Come on.

1627
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:01,380
Yay!

1628
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,870
A terrible toy that was created by the most manacle of men.

1629
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,110
It's wound up with a key on its back.

1630
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,950
It can start itself.

1631
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,410
This is Bowser Jr.'s favorite toy.

1632
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,930
Wait, does he have sentience then?

1633
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:21,950
Alright.

1634
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,030
Who wants to be mecha koopa, guys?

1635
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,130
Who wants to be a toy?

1636
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,510
Whose only purpose is to die.

1637
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,450
Alright, rag.

1638
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:36,890
Rag.

1639
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:40,290
Rag.

1640
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:40,870
Goon.

1641
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:41,630
There you go.

1642
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:42,830
Ragoon.

1643
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:46,870
Goddammit.

1644
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:47,090
Okay.

1645
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,610
I must be close to catching all the...

1646
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,590
stuff, right?

1647
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,250
In these rooms?

1648
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,550
Okay, I should really...

1649
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:58,790
Fuck.

1650
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,170
Whoops.

1651
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,390
Please beat us on TM.

1652
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,690
You're not using them anyway.

1653
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,790
Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

1654
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,110
Thank you.

1655
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:07,910
You don't know that.

1656
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,310
What if at the end of the Bowser fight...

1657
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:10,930
Like...

1658
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,470
It's like my moment to shine.

1659
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,750
Oops.

1660
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,510
Sorry, Stickbug.

1661
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,630
I wasn't...

1662
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,170
Whoops.

1663
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,070
Alright.

1664
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,110
Goodbye, Stickbug.

1665
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,770
Oh, nice!

1666
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,550
Okay, it did nothing.

1667
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,570
I wasn't paying attention.

1668
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:23,370
So I was like, oops.

1669
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,330
Okay, we need to go back.

1670
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,390
So I can...

1671
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,310
I can use...

1672
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,670
I can heal Dad.

1673
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,690
Thank God, Stickbug lived.

1674
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,330
And he's so fucking fast.

1675
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,210
So I can, like, run away from everything.

1676
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:41,490
It's right...

1677
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,030
Yeah?

1678
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:42,970
Yeah.

1679
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:43,490
Alright.

1680
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,190
Nice.

1681
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,680
Oh, yeah.

1682
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,660
Can I use an...

1683
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,140
Can I just...

1684
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,160
Oh, I could just TP.

1685
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,300
I could just use my warp pipe.

1686
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:54,740
You're right.

1687
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,360
I forgot about my warp pipe.

1688
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,220
Alright, next time I'll just warp pipe out.

1689
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,540
I forgot I have other items in my inventory.

1690
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:07,860
Alright.

1691
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,740
Goodbye, Mecha Koopa.

1692
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,140
Hello, fight me.

1693
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,560
I need your XP.

1694
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,040
So Dad won't be slow as fuck.

1695
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,140
Superfly?

1696
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,320
The fuck?

1697
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,280
What's that?

1698
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:27,980
Where is he from?

1699
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,880
I've never seen that guy before.

1700
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,200
Oh, he hurt himself.

1701
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,100
For what reason?

1702
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,900
I don't think I'm smart enough to understand this guy's mind.

1703
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,660
I'm just like...

1704
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,120
We'll never understand what goes on in that mind.

1705
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,300
Like, what the fuck?

1706
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,500
Why did he do that?

1707
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,040
His goals are beyond your comprehension.

1708
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,790
Oh, Final Gambit.

1709
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:14,350
What's that?

1710
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,350
Use your fangs to damage a foe equal to its HP.

1711
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:26,270
Oh, so like, it does max.

1712
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:29,650
Wait, why do that?

1713
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,390
When I can just use explosion.

1714
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,730
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1715
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,970
That's just explosion.

1716
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,930
With more steps.

1717
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,510
Explosion, but different.

1718
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,630
Alright, get out of here.

1719
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,810
Go find your girl.

1720
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:52,790
Short kings.

1721
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:55,530
I believe in them.

1722
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,190
Okay.

1723
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:05,610
Alright, we go that way.

1724
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,510
There's a door here.

1725
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:08,150
Oh!

1726
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,210
Oh, no, I already have one.

1727
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,570
Alright, where am I?

1728
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,730
I can't even go anywhere here.

1729
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,330
What the fuck is the point of that room?

1730
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:28,790
That room was so fucking big.

1731
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:32,730
Okay, we go down here.

1732
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,090
Wait, is there...

1733
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,050
I didn't go upstairs.

1734
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,130
Maybe there's something upstairs.

1735
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,440
Oh, yeah, there is.

1736
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,020
Nice.

1737
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,840
Oh, it was just a hat.

1738
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,600
We can't go through here?

1739
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:47,980
No.

1740
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,760
Okay, I need to find a button for here.

1741
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,940
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1742
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,140
Okay, must have got all of them now, right?

1743
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,760
Oh, my God.

1744
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,440
That's it.

1745
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,820
I'm angry.

1746
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,700
Okay, never mind.

1747
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,480
Apparently...

1748
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,760
He knew my bluff.

1749
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,520
I...

1750
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,420
He saw my bluff.

1751
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,020
Alright, I'm warping out.

1752
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,580
Wait, where am I?

1753
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:22,780
Where do I...

1754
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,500
Where am I?

1755
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,880
Where do I live here?

1756
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,280
Alright, that's Daisy Cruiser.

1757
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,080
Cloud Cap.

1758
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,380
Shiny Galaxy.

1759
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,660
Where the fuck am I?

1760
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,280
Oh, right here.

1761
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,520
Okay, I'll just TP back.

1762
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,050
Alright, heal me.

1763
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,350
And then...

1764
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:45,330
Where was the door again?

1765
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,130
Was it here?

1766
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,030
Oh, no.

1767
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:47,910
It was at the first floor.

1768
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,150
I remember.

1769
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,210
There it is.

1770
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,150
See, guys?

1771
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,670
I can beat mazes.

1772
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,930
Not as it seems in Lord Bowser's castle.

1773
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,950
What wears like this is that you can poke out of...

1774
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:04,690
Or actually tunnels.

1775
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:06,450
Tunnels?

1776
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:08,110
Oh.

1777
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:09,810
How does this work?

1778
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,510
I can figure this out.

1779
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,570
Guys, I can figure this out.

1780
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,310
Give me a sec.

1781
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,090
Okay, let me reset this real quick.

1782
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,110
Let me...

1783
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,250
Okay, I got...

1784
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,510
Okay, give me a sec.

1785
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,550
I can figure this out.

1786
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:01,930
Guys, I'm tired.

1787
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,710
I'm so tired.

1788
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:05,830
Okay.

1789
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,490
I can figure this out.

1790
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,440
Yeah!

1791
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,060
Okay, give me a sec.

1792
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,320
Wait a minute.

1793
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,020
But not by your hammer?

1794
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,160
Oh!

1795
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,020
Wait, I can reset this here, right?

1796
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,760
Okay.

1797
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,720
Okay, now we clear the path for the bullet.

1798
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,600
It was a long game, guys.

1799
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,360
Okay.

1800
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,440
I can figure this out.

1801
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,600
Oh, that's awkward.

1802
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:27,900
Guys, it's a long, long game.

1803
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,160
I'm tired.

1804
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,800
I'm so tired of all these fucking guys who want to be prisoners.

1805
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,540
Okay, there you go.

1806
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,220
I need, like...

1807
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,920
I need no interruptions.

1808
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,540
Okay, this time.

1809
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:57,880
Okay.

1810
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,600
Give me a sec, guys.

1811
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,400
I'm thinking.

1812
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,060
Oh.

1813
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:31,970
Give me a sec, guys.

1814
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,220
Oh.

1815
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:37,980
Um.

1816
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,220
Oh, it could have threw a cannon?

1817
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:44,960
Oh, nice.

1818
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,480
Okay.

1819
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,880
Oh, okay.

1820
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,580
I told you.

1821
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,340
Look at that.

1822
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,480
Look at that.

1823
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,500
Look at that.

1824
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,480
I'm so smart.

1825
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,480
I'm so fucking smart.

1826
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,500
Oh, my God.

1827
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,960
I'm actually a genius.

1828
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,540
Oh, my God.

1829
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,420
I should get, like, those...

1830
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,880
You know, like, those, like, special degrees?

1831
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,620
You know those universities that give you, like, specialized degrees?

1832
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,780
You don't have to do anything.

1833
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,400
You just gotta be famous and then you earn one.

1834
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,600
I deserve one of those.

1835
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,440
Privileged degrees.

1836
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:33,590
Yeah.

1837
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,050
I should get an honorary degree.

1838
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:37,990
I wonder if, like, you can actually do anything with it.

1839
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:39,470
Oh, my God.

1840
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,390
I didn't even read.

1841
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,770
I was like, why didn't that work?

1842
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:43,390
I forgot he's also fire.

1843
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,610
I wonder if you can actually, like, do anything with those degrees.

1844
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:58,070
Like, if you get one from, like, a university that specializes in, like, doctorate degrees.

1845
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,250
Or, like, that specializes in, like, making doctors.

1846
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,630
And then, like, you know, you just flash...

1847
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:05,570
You're like, don't worry, guys.

1848
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,850
I'm a doctor.

1849
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,550
And then you flash a degree real quick.

1850
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:11,770
But you don't, like, let them see what that says honorary degree.

1851
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,450
And be like, no, guys.

1852
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,550
It's Dr. Doki to you.

1853
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,480
Yeah, but then they'll be like, oh, you see a degree that's from Harvard.

1854
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,860
And he's like, don't worry, guys.

1855
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:37,560
Wait, no.

1856
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,440
Harvard's for law.

1857
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,200
Okay, yeah.

1858
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,260
Sorry.

1859
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,260
Harvard's for law.

1860
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,600
That's not for doctorate.

1861
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,260
I'm trying to remember which school is for doctors.

1862
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,720
And business, too.

1863
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:08,690
Yeah, but isn't it mostly for, like, law?

1864
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:10,570
They're mostly specialized in law.

1865
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:11,710
And business.

1866
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,280
I mean, it's still Harvard, I guess.

1867
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,740
Harvard is still Harvard.

1868
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,220
You're right.

1869
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,560
I feel like I could just be like, yeah, guys.

1870
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,580
I went to Harvard.

1871
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,680
And then you just flash the honor degree.

1872
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,820
I don't know if you can, like, Photoshop a Harvard degree.

1873
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,100
And just change your name.

1874
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,300
Like, how would people...

1875
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,920
Okay, but, like...

1876
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:58,100
Okay, but if you're, like, applying for, like, not, like, you know, the toppest position in, like...

1877
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,600
Isn't that...

1878
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,140
Yeah, if you get caught...

1879
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:03,160
I'm saying, okay.

1880
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,220
Obviously, you know...

1881
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,580
If you try to be, like, a big lawyer in a big lawyer company...

1882
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,920
Like, obviously, they'll check on your databases.

1883
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,100
Because, like, some...

1884
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,060
Some, like, law firms actually are, like...

1885
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,380
They only hire Harvard students and stuff.

1886
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,820
Okay, you should not have sat on that.

1887
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:22,580
But...

1888
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:25,460
But, like...

1889
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,180
Like, if...

1890
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,900
Like, but, like, if you try to go for a job for, like, you know, a small town...

1891
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,040
A small town law firm...

1892
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,160
And then they're, like...

1893
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,800
Oh, why did you want to work here?

1894
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,320
Like, you could have any...

1895
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:36,800
And you're, like...

1896
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,620
Oh, I just want to...

1897
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,280
I just want...

1898
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,860
I just want to...

1899
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,640
You know...

1900
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,660
Relax from this big city.

1901
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,040
Like...

1902
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,420
I just...

1903
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:51,160
I just want to relax from the big city.

1904
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:51,460
Okay.

1905
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,900
For legal reasons...

1906
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,140
Guys, for legal reasons...

1907
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,920
It's a joke.

1908
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,180
For legal reasons...

1909
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,740
This is a joke, guys.

1910
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,180
I would never commit fraud.

1911
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,160
It's just a hee-ha-ha, hee-ha-ha moment.

1912
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,700
It's just a joke, guys.

1913
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,040
It's just a joke.

1914
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,100
But, like, I'm just wondering.

1915
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,720
I'm pretty sure somebody has done it.

1916
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,020
There's no way.

1917
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,400
There's no way, like...

1918
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,420
Like, someone hasn't done something like that.

1919
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:24,820
Wait, what?

1920
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,320
What did I open?

1921
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:28,660
What did I open?

1922
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,420
I don't even know what I opened.

1923
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,300
Wait, did it work?

1924
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,100
Did it work?

1925
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,040
Yeah, but, like...

1926
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,320
A small town... a small-time firm in...

1927
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,620
Okay, I'm gonna use the rappel.

1928
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,860
A small-town firm in, like, not a big city?

1929
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,760
Like, they won't check around.

1930
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,960
Like, how would they check?

1931
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,620
If your degree is actually from Harvard.

1932
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,800
Harvard, they don't have the power for that.

1933
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,760
Oh, I don't have a wand.

1934
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,960
Oh, I turned it off!

1935
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,540
They call Harvard.

1936
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,120
Just be like, oh, my family was just tired of the big city.

1937
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,380
But, like, they don't know you have no family.

1938
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,300
You'd be like, the wife and kids.

1939
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,280
They were just...

1940
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,660
They just wanted to be closer to their parents.

1941
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,060
So, that's why I'm here.

1942
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:24,820
I...

1943
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,240
A sentient slab of payment is stubborn and refuses to forget grudges.

1944
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,540
Now, it's just sad!

1945
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,260
It's sort of special...

1946
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:48,400
Social dominance is determined by the number of cracks on its back.

1947
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,620
Like, okay.

1948
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:50,980
I know.

1949
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,380
So, then, you don't...

1950
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,320
You don't Photoshop a Harvard degree.

1951
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,600
You Photoshop a tier below Harvard.

1952
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,260
Like, brown or something.

1953
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:02,100
Like, I don't know.

1954
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,400
Um, Stanford or something.

1955
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:05,560
Like,

1956
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:13,940
I don't know.

1957
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,920
Um, Stanford or something.

1958
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,260
Oh, stop taking...

1959
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,040
Don't you resist the temptation.

1960
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:27,560
Alright.

1961
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,620
Uh, Cardi, thank you for the super chat.

1962
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:31,980
Thank you.

1963
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:32,840
Thank you.

1964
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,160
Oh, you want to be a womp?

1965
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,220
Alright, Cardi.

1966
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,520
Cardi...

1967
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:42,940
Cardi...

1968
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:43,640
Goon.

1969
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,010
Alright, I didn't even realize I turned it off.

1970
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,170
I thought I turned it on.

1971
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,390
Gotta remember how to get back, though.

1972
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:58,830
And it's like, here?

1973
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,360
I'm pretty sure I caught every...

1974
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:04,760
Oh, no!

1975
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:05,620
There's a thomp!

1976
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,400
Oh, my God.

1977
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,940
Just as I said that.

1978
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,320
A thomp appeared.

1979
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,240
He's like, you caught my brother.

1980
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm here for revenge.

1981
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,800
That's why you have to end all bloodline.

1982
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,320
So there's never...

1983
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,700
So they can't do any revenge.

1984
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,000
That's the Deadpool.

1985
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1986
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:23,860
Thank you.

1987
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:24,480
This is all hype.

1988
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,860
Guys, for legal reasons, do not try anything I'm saying.

1989
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:34,000
If you get caught, and you're like, oh, I watched a Jokey Bird stream.

1990
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,380
And, like, she inspired me to do it.

1991
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,640
For legal reasons, you cannot say that it was because of me.

1992
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,000
Disclaimer, because it was a joke.

1993
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,170
A spiked slab of concrete.

1994
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,750
With the ability to have...

1995
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,590
It's like when someone was like...

1996
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:56,030
When someone goes like, no homo.

1997
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:56,550
You know?

1998
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,310
This is my version.

1999
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,530
For legal reasons, this is a joke.

2000
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,970
So it doesn't count, guys.

2001
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,450
It doesn't...

2002
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:11,910
Legally, I am exempt from any fraud charges.

2003
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,530
In medieval times, it guarded...

2004
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,490
No crime-o.

2005
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:17,770
Yeah.

2006
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,170
No fraud-o.

2007
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,350
No fraud-o, guys.

2008
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,350
No fraud-o.

2009
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:32,030
In medieval times, it guarded the entrances to castles occupied by powerful tyrants.

2010
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,560
All right.

2011
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,320
Who wants to be thromphed?

2012
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,880
And be married to...

2013
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,040
Whomp.

2014
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,220
Tiny?

2015
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:50,800
All right.

2016
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:51,420
Tiny.

2017
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,060
I think it's above average.

2018
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:56,840
Don't worry.

2019
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,480
If you squint hard enough.

2020
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,480
Tiny ghoul.

2021
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,360
No, they're married.

2022
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,620
I have to do it again?

2023
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,880
All right.

2024
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,200
Stop thinking for the super chat.

2025
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:25,560
Thank you.

2026
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,420
Thank you.

2027
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:35,020
Why go through all the effort when everyone knows the easiest way to get a fake degree from Harvard is to donate an undisclosed amount of money in them.

2028
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,340
Thank you for the super chat.

2029
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:36,740
Thank you.

2030
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,120
Thank you.

2031
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,600
Okay, but like...

2032
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,300
What if you don't have millions of dollars, guys?

2033
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,720
I'm for the people.

2034
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,320
Wait, do I have to turn it?

2035
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,560
I'm so confused.

2036
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:49,940
Oh no, there's...

2037
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,940
It's off over there.

2038
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,900
Wait, how do I get there?

2039
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,540
Oh!

2040
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,020
Wait, how the fuck do I get there?

2041
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,300
Oh my...

2042
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,160
I'm so lost.

2043
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,820
It's like it's a maze or some shit.

2044
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:09,210
Okay, let's just use the e-guide.

2045
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,230
All right.

2046
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:14,870
Oh, it's neat.

2047
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,150
Thank you for the super chat.

2048
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,550
Thank you.

2049
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,330
Thank you.

2050
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:19,210
Maybe here?

2051
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:20,670
No.

2052
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:23,430
Oh yeah, it is here.

2053
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:24,030
Okay, nice.

2054
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,490
Oh, now I can use lava.

2055
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:29,870
All right.

2056
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,550
I can use lava now, guys.

2057
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,250
It's okay.

2058
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:34,310
The world is safe.

2059
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,550
Toki's lawyer found dead from alcohol poisoning.

2060
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:43,390
Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

2061
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:43,810
Thank you.

2062
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:44,430
Thank you.

2063
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:46,130
Oh wait, I can fish in here.

2064
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,430
Maybe I'll get a blog.

2065
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:50,930
Yeah!

2066
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:55,530
I've got the blog.

2067
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,650
I'm not a doctor.

2068
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:59,890
It's just my legal name.

2069
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:01,850
That's so smart.

2070
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,950
You can have your first name be Doctor.

2071
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,130
Just legally...

2072
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:06,850
You can legally change your name to anything.

2073
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,970
And just legally change your first name to Doctor.

2074
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:10,810
So then you can...

2075
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:13,770
And then your last name to be like your first name.

2076
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,850
Oh, I can't catch it because he like flew away, I guess.

2077
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:22,750
Wait, what did he do?

2078
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,310
It's like Doctor Spaceman.

2079
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,530
You know that.

2080
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,470
I'd be like, Oh yeah, my name is Doctor Doki.

2081
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,330
And then it'd be like, Wow, you're a doctor?

2082
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:36,690
And then you just don't say anything.

2083
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:40,070
Because it's not lying if you omit information.

2084
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,900
You're not committing any crime if you just be like, Oh, I didn't hear what you said.

2085
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,500
No frado.

2086
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,700
No frado.

2087
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,620
No, no.

2088
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,020
You can just be like, Oh, I didn't hear what they said.

2089
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,640
I didn't know that you're asking if that was my first name or not.

2090
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,120
You can just be like, Oh, I didn't hear her.

2091
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,300
It's just that of you.

2092
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,800
And they don't know if you actually heard her or not.

2093
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,440
No frado.

2094
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,500
A dragon made of magma.

2095
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,700
It lives deep inside volcanic caverns.

2096
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,600
It is very territorial, creating intruders with giant, invincible bite attack.

2097
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,540
Uh...

2098
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:44,540
All right.

2099
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,420
You know what, Yabby?

2100
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,380
I'll name it after you.

2101
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:53,340
Yabby Goon for your lovely idea of no frado.

2102
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,840
Just be like, Oh, I didn't hear them.

2103
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,180
I didn't know that they asked me about whether or not I'm an actual doctor or not.

2104
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,140
I just didn't correct them because I couldn't hear.

2105
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,640
There you go.

2106
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,740
How will they know?

2107
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,840
They can't fucking...

2108
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,600
What are they gonna do?

2109
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,560
Put a lie detector on me?

2110
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,180
That shit's fake.

2111
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,180
That shit's a scam.

2112
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:23,720
A lie detector, all they do is just like, uh, check your heart rate.

2113
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,780
So as long as your heart rate is at, like, as long as you can lower your heart rate, you're fine.

2114
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,160
It's that easy.

2115
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:32,920
Yes.

2116
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,440
It's just lower your heart rate, guys.

2117
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,620
Just be legally dead and you should be fine.

2118
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,680
Yeah, I'm trying to fish right now.

2119
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,460
Just don't get nervous.

2120
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:45,700
Yeah.

2121
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,180
He's a pathological liar.

2122
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:55,920
I can do that.

2123
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:08,570
Oh, yeah.

2124
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:09,950
It just has to be a constant rate.

2125
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:10,730
That's fun.

2126
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:13,190
Oh, lava drop.

2127
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:14,190
Okay, let's catch him.

2128
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:16,110
Yeah, it's not a lie.

2129
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:16,650
Exactly.

2130
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:17,510
It's not a lie.

2131
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:18,450
You believe in it.

2132
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,350
I believe I can be a doctor.

2133
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,790
I just didn't commit to the time yet.

2134
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:28,770
But, like...

2135
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:32,410
I believe that in an alternate universe...

2136
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,250
I am a doctor there.

2137
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:37,110
So, technically, I can be a doctor.

2138
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:39,810
Technically, one form of me is a doctor.

2139
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:40,850
So, I am a doctor.

2140
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:44,730
A carefree fire spirit.

2141
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:47,230
It lives in caverns and traveling groups.

2142
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:51,650
It must be careful not to get snuffed up by strong gusts or powerful shockwaves.

2143
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:52,810
You know what?

2144
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,810
Dr. Doki.

2145
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,990
First name, doctor.

2146
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,270
Last name, Doki.

2147
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,830
Chat, would you trust Doki was...

2148
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:14,030
Like, Kuba, I think it was a super chat thing.

2149
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,080
I could be a doctor too.

2150
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,640
I am...

2151
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,380
One form of Doki went through seven years of medical school.

2152
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:34,430
You cannot wait to talk to me, Mario?

2153
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:36,250
That means the whole world.

2154
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:37,650
Please, have this.

2155
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:39,070
You deserve it.

2156
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:41,150
Yeah.

2157
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:44,590
Okay, fine.

2158
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:45,570
Thank you for the super chat.

2159
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:45,930
Thank you.

2160
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,670
Thank you.

2161
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,550
Oh my god.

2162
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:50,350
What the fuck?

2163
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,510
He gave me so much shit.

2164
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:54,030
What the fuck?

2165
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,190
What did you give me?

2166
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:57,730
Where am I?

2167
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:00,070
I'm so lost.

2168
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:02,610
I have not, like, retained...

2169
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,930
Information of where I've been.

2170
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:08,810
Alright.

2171
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,110
Okay, let's use the rappel.

2172
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:19,990
There must be a...

2173
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,250
There must be something here, right?

2174
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:22,470
Yeah.

2175
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:23,110
Oh, there you go.

2176
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:23,950
There's a Goomba here.

2177
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:27,410
I, uh...

2178
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,310
Lost my stack.

2179
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:29,150
Oh no.

2180
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,550
Were you the bottom or the top?

2181
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:31,390
Or the mid?

2182
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,520
Okay, there's something...

2183
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,020
Oh wait, no.

2184
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,200
I've been to this part.

2185
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,140
Oh, this lava is really scary.

2186
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,200
My trusty shell protects me.

2187
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,320
Yours can't do if I find the Koopa Troop anti-lava shell somewhere in the castle.

2188
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,260
Oh, I was just there.

2189
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,500
He used to swim.

2190
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,200
Lord Bowser instructed me to spin in place.

2191
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,760
Oh, it's a blue shell.

2192
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,320
Koopa.

2193
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,640
Oh yeah, that's true.

2194
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,700
It might have been the bottom shell.

2195
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,740
He got kicked out.

2196
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:12,270
All right, let's get that.

2197
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:14,670
Oh, is it a hand?

2198
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:15,750
Oh, I knew it.

2199
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:16,610
It's always a hand.

2200
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,560
Yeah, but the thing about being in the middle is that everybody forgets about you.

2201
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,920
Okay, slam 80.

2202
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,300
Sucker punch.

2203
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,280
Let's just keep the dark move.

2204
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,700
I feel like the dark move might be actually good.

2205
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,300
No one remembers you, so you can stay in your stack.

2206
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,960
Middle stack, child.

2207
01:25:58,730 --> 01:25:59,170
Yay!

2208
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,480
What is this move?

2209
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,180
Oh yeah, no, you don't need HP.

2210
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,140
If you...

2211
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:13,100
If you attack first and you hit hard, you'll never need to recover your HP because they never get to hit you.

2212
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,700
That's my motto.

2213
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,320
Yay!

2214
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:20,100
Bro's bean!

2215
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,020
Wait, what's that?

2216
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:26,270
What is that?

2217
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:30,170
Max bean.

2218
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:31,430
Delicious.

2219
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:32,810
That revives.

2220
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:34,430
That...

2221
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:35,650
Gladly...

2222
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,310
Wait, what's a bro's bean?

2223
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,690
Is it even here?

2224
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,660
The fuck is my bro bean?

2225
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,540
Oh, there it is.

2226
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh, it raises the maximum.

2227
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:51,900
Oh, okay.

2228
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:53,200
That's useless for me.

2229
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,620
Wait, I'm back here.

2230
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:58,900
Where am I?

2231
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,860
I'm back here, but where is here exactly?

2232
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:08,960
Oh my god.

2233
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,540
Where did I...

2234
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,520
Where did I go?

2235
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,720
I don't know.

2236
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,160
Okay, I came from here.

2237
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,080
Okay, and then...

2238
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,260
I swim.

2239
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,450
Okay, I'll go this way.

2240
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:32,090
And then now I'm here.

2241
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:33,690
Wherever here is.

2242
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:35,830
Oh, okay, there's a toad here.

2243
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:37,010
I never talked to them before.

2244
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:41,330
I keep losing my fate when fish are in this pond.

2245
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:42,670
Isn't that strange?

2246
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:44,590
Alright.

2247
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:45,890
Got the dragon claw.

2248
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:50,090
Okay, I can fight these two.

2249
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:54,080
Hey!

2250
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,620
You wanna join a game of tag?

2251
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,520
Is this a double battle?

2252
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,900
Oh no, I just interrupted your tag.

2253
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,700
Alright, sit!

2254
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:12,900
Yay!

2255
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:19,420
They weren't wrong when they said, like, this one would be the longest level.

2256
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:20,600
I'm so confused.

2257
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,860
I think it doesn't help that I'm tired.

2258
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:27,160
Like, I'm not retaining any information right now.

2259
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:32,280
I have, like, I have no short-term or I have short-term and long-term memory loss.

2260
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,640
It's like that girl from, like, what was it, 50 First Dates, where she forgets every day.

2261
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,560
That's one of my favorite movies, by the way.

2262
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,620
It's such a good rom-com.

2263
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,720
I actually have, like, the special edition DVD for that.

2264
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,180
I remember nothing.

2265
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,980
Hut, two, three, four.

2266
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,320
Hut, two, three, four.

2267
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,860
Uh, no, we're finishing it on...

2268
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,680
Was it say Monday?

2269
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:02,080
We're finishing it on Wednesday.

2270
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:06,300
Oh yeah, people were so surprised I posted an early schedule yesterday.

2271
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:10,000
But, like, I literally have, like, everything just planned.

2272
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:11,580
Coincidentally.

2273
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,340
Like, I don't have to, like, decide, like, figure out.

2274
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:15,800
Like, I didn't have to wait for anything.

2275
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,680
I didn't have to, like, figure out, like...

2276
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,440
Um, um, like, per...

2277
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,360
Like, if I have to...

2278
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:23,980
Not perms.

2279
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,160
God, what am I saying?

2280
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,280
I'm an indie with perms.

2281
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:27,000
Um...

2282
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,680
I didn't have to, like, be like, oh, can I stream this that day?

2283
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,820
It was more so, like...

2284
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:37,040
I didn't have to wait for, like, any permission or anything about, like...

2285
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:37,960
You know, like, sponsors.

2286
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,020
And I already had my collab line.

2287
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,360
Remember when I said, like, last week?

2288
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,080
I was like, oh, yeah, I don't collab line up for this week with Doobie.

2289
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,800
But I didn't say it was with Doobie.

2290
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,520
I was just like, you know...

2291
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,100
Um, but we just didn't decide on the time and date.

2292
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,360
And, like, coincidentally, like, um...

2293
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:58,560
You know, she was online on Discord when I asked her, like, oh, you wanna do it this time?

2294
01:29:58,620 --> 01:29:59,480
She's like, yeah, let's do it.

2295
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,980
So then, you know, everything just went up.

2296
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,500
Went, like, you know, fast.

2297
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,920
Yeah, D&D collab.

2298
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:08,660
This week.

2299
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:14,350
Because at first, we were just gonna do, like...

2300
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,350
At first, it was just, like, learning CS...

2301
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:16,870
Uh, CS...

2302
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:17,830
I almost said CSGO 2.

2303
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:19,850
I didn't realize it was just called CS2.

2304
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:23,190
But at first, we were just gonna do, like, learning CS2.

2305
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:24,450
But then I asked...

2306
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:26,850
Like, she was saying how she actually still enjoyed Overwatch.

2307
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,470
And I was like, wow.

2308
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:31,090
You know, I was like, that's impressive.

2309
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:35,210
Like, you know, because, like, there's someone out there that still enjoys Overwatch at its current state.

2310
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,710
So then I was like, no, but have you tried Stadium?

2311
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:40,410
Because, you know, Stadium's actually, like, fun, you know?

2312
01:30:40,410 --> 01:31:03,780
So, compared to normal Overwatch, jeez, I was very, I was like, oh my god, like, I hope this isn't Stockholm Syndrome, I, no, because, like, Overwatch at its current state is, like, um, oh shit, what, how does that still hate, hate me?

2313
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,480
At its current state, obviously, is, like, not the greatest.

2314
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:20,520
But, like, um, Stadium, in my opinion, is actually incredibly fun to play.

2315
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,640
I, I absolutely enjoy Stadium.

2316
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,380
Like, I play Stadium on my free time sometimes.

2317
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,320
Mario, you made it!

2318
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,480
Someone said I have a rest stop in this room!

2319
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:33,240
You should take advantage of this and use the chance to rest up!

2320
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,320
How?

2321
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,820
Oh, you want them heal me?

2322
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,900
The power of science is amazing!

2323
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,040
Now you can connect to someone else's PC and battle against them!

2324
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:42,900
What?

2325
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,660
You're expecting to hear something like this around 21 hours ago?

2326
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,780
Sorry, I couldn't find time to make it to Toe Town.

2327
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,420
But yeah, and then she said she never tried, um, Stadium before.

2328
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,380
So, um, so now I was like, oh my god, we should try it.

2329
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,200
And she's like, oh yeah, we can try, do both Stadium and, and CS, you know, after you're done learning CS.

2330
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,940
We can cool off with Stadium.

2331
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:03,980
I thought it was a good idea.

2332
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,520
Have you seen my bro?

2333
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,420
We're making a stack so we can impress a Lady Goomba.

2334
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:11,140
He seems he fell off somewhere along the way.

2335
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,860
So that Doki I fought that one time might have been you?

2336
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:22,960
I don't know, maybe.

2337
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,520
I always lie and say no.

2338
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:34,760
And the best thing about Overwatch names is that anybody can be Doki Bird in Overwatch.

2339
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,600
So like, if, you guys should all name yourself Doki Bird so you can confuse all the other players.

2340
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,780
All the other dragoons.

2341
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,940
So then when all the other dragoons ask you if you're the real Doki Bird, just say no.

2342
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,180
And then they'll think, and then you'll think you're me.

2343
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,360
You've been picking up any keys?

2344
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,000
You're gonna need at least three and want to get through the entire castle.

2345
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,820
But you didn't hear that from me.

2346
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,880
What was that revolution?

2347
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,800
The Brig revolution that they did?

2348
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,120
Oh wait, no.

2349
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,700
Oh, okay, sorry.

2350
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,800
There are several revolutions in Overwatch.

2351
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:12,640
Yes, Overwatch had like several like in-game revolutions for rank.

2352
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,520
One was Brig related, and the other one was Torbjorn.

2353
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,340
Like, oh yeah, throw for Defran.

2354
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:24,620
There was throw for Defran, and also the, what was it?

2355
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:25,560
The Brig revolution?

2356
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,540
I don't remember the, the Brig one.

2357
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,060
I don't remember.

2358
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:34,620
It's like, everybody would name themselves one name to be all like united as a friend against the cause.

2359
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,920
But I don't remember what the Brig one was.

2360
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,060
Are you thinking of proceeding to the second foot floor?

2361
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,360
A word of advice?

2362
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,660
Don't be afraid to fall down.

2363
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,680
Oh, and can always use escape back to this rest area, if you know what I mean.

2364
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,820
I'm used to warm conditions.

2365
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,280
But this place is ridiculous!

2366
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,960
How does anyone get anything done like this?

2367
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:58,820
I don't remember what it was called.

2368
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,220
You guys remember?

2369
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:07,220
But yeah, anyway, on a topic of that...

2370
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,080
Um...

2371
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,980
Just re- You guys should like, rename yourself Stokeybird.

2372
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,580
And then like, and then people would be like, Where the fuck are all these Dokeybirds coming from?

2373
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,000
I don't remember.

2374
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,420
I remember it was like, something related to Brig.

2375
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:25,320
But I don't remember.

2376
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,940
Was it like, Ban Brig or something?

2377
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,940
I don't fucking remember.

2378
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,100
It was so long ago.

2379
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:32,880
The great Dokeybird.

2380
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,460
And then they ask you if you're the real Dokeybird.

2381
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,340
Just say no.

2382
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,340
So then like, no one will know.

2383
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,180
Which one's the real Dokeybird.

2384
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:42,900
They'll be like, can the real Dokeybird please stand up?

2385
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,220
And then I'll be there too.

2386
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,800
And then there'll be like, two Dokeybirds in the same...

2387
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,760
In the same game.

2388
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,960
People will be like, which one's the real Dokeybird?

2389
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,680
And now we'll both say no.

2390
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,020
But they'll never know that I was the real Dokeybird.

2391
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,560
I am...

2392
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,940
Oh yeah, it was Delete Brig!

2393
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:03,600
Yeah, alright, so there was a Delete Brig revolution.

2394
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:08,920
Where like, everyone was naming themselves Delete Brig, even the high ELOs.

2395
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:14,060
And they'll be like, they'll be like, what is your cause?

2396
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,220
And I'll be like, I don't know, I just thought it would be funny.

2397
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:23,920
They'll be like, what is... what are they trying to revolutionize?

2398
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,540
And I was like, I don't know, it's just funny.

2399
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,940
For the laughs.

2400
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,840
They'll just be like, they'll just be like, it just suddenly spawns out of nowhere.

2401
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,280
Okay, now I'm room two.

2402
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,800
There was a Mercy revolution too, I don't, there's so many.

2403
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:05,040
Like, Overwatch has existed for so long, that it felt like it went through its own like, history textbook.

2404
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,700
Like, it has, I swear, it has its own history textbook.

2405
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,240
It went through so much lore.

2406
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:17,900
This thing is, the thing is...

2407
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:24,420
Overwatch created like, a sub-community of like, for like, Mercy players.

2408
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:29,260
Like, it's like their own little community and like, lifestyle.

2409
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,420
Being a Mercy player.

2410
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,780
It's actually, it's actually so interesting.

2411
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,620
Lali, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2412
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,120
Francisco, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2413
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,400
Lali, thank you again for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2414
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,220
I always thought the... wait... Last Resort?

2415
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,080
Oh, I wasn't... What was this?

2416
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:57,780
What's Last Resort?

2417
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,640
That sounds like a cool move.

2418
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,940
Oh, okay, never mind.

2419
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,640
That seems like a terrible move.

2420
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,180
Uh, I always thought the ending was fucked because they had kids.

2421
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:14,080
Imagine waking up eight months pregnant and you're told you already had another kid.

2422
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:18,520
Wait, what... What was... What is the context for that?

2423
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,120
What?

2424
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,300
I wasn't paying attention!

2425
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,800
What... What context was that?

2426
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,240
Oh, 50 first dates.

2427
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,540
Oh, okay.

2428
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:34,180
I was like... Wait, that was the ending?

2429
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,220
Oh... Oh my god!

2430
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:44,400
I forgot that was the ending.

2431
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,080
Okay, never mind.

2432
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,160
That's a little fucked.

2433
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:54,800
I just thought it was so cute, you know, in the beginning of the...

2434
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,600
I did not really... I... Oh yeah, it's King Boo!

2435
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,240
I... I did not remember that ending.

2436
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,500
Oh no, for some reason I just thought she was cured.

2437
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,440
At the end.

2438
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:15,600
I... I was like, love cures everything.

2439
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,740
Even a brain...

2440
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:20,880
Even when you're missing half your brain.

2441
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,220
Love can cure anything.

2442
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:32,240
Oh no, the love just grew back part of her brain.

2443
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:37,060
Love always wins.

2444
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:46,160
With the power of love, anything is possible.

2445
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,540
Nah, I'm not gonna fight you.

2446
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:52,740
Not as long as Lord Bowser keeps stationing us directly in front of Bullet Bill Blasters.

2447
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:00,940
Oh my god, I'm so... Oh my god, it's the fucking Super Mario Bros.

2448
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:01,600
3 game.

2449
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:05,040
I love Super Mario Bros.

2450
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:05,240
3!

2451
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:06,840
I love Super Mario Bros.

2452
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:07,060
3!

2453
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,320
How did you get here?

2454
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:09,060
How...

2455
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:17,430
Okay, to be fair, I haven't watched 50 First Dates in a long time.

2456
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:19,170
Guys...

2457
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:21,210
Can you win against this?

2458
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,930
How did they get here?

2459
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:25,470
Exactly!

2460
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:31,910
It's like, no matter where you go, you can escape the Super Mario Bros.

2461
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:32,630
3 game.

2462
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,530
No, my money!

2463
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:39,770
Oh, this is where I should get...

2464
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,830
Oh, I would have to get new captures here.

2465
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:43,410
I just forgot about that.

2466
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:46,210
I just realized I would get new captures here.

2467
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:55,330
Okay, so I should have like...

2468
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:56,150
Escape.

2469
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:57,970
Where is the escape key?

2470
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,020
Okay, escape rope.

2471
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:04,380
Okay.

2472
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:08,280
Because I want to heal real quick.

2473
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:09,380
And then...

2474
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,220
I want to heal real quick.

2475
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:15,960
And then...

2476
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,620
So that won't die.

2477
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:19,360
And then...

2478
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,300
Turn off...

2479
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,880
Okay, I should register this.

2480
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:23,900
List.

2481
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,340
And then...

2482
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,600
Get rid of this.

2483
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,960
Actually, I should register this too.

2484
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:31,200
So I can...

2485
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:32,800
Conveniently use it later.

2486
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:34,020
I can...

2487
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,120
Uh...

2488
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,580
It was here.

2489
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,280
Bum-ba-dum, bum-ba-dum, bum-ba-dum, bum.

2490
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:41,780
Yay!

2491
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,700
New captures!

2492
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:44,880
New goons!

2493
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:45,620
New prisoners!

2494
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:45,920
New prisoners!

2495
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,280
Okay.

2496
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:50,040
Don't worry.

2497
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:50,940
I have a lot of them.

2498
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:00,400
Yay!

2499
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,740
Not yay!

2500
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,040
Come on!

2501
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,160
Oh yeah!

2502
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,400
I read like recent Pokemon lore.

2503
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,600
Of like...

2504
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,980
How like Pokeballs work.

2505
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:12,360
So like...

2506
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,620
Basically like...

2507
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,860
When you're in the Pokeball...

2508
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,640
It's basically like...

2509
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,540
A little mini environment.

2510
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,700
In the...

2511
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,340
Pokeball...

2512
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,040
Don't resist.

2513
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:23,800
Like...

2514
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,760
Stop resisting.

2515
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:25,780
Um...

2516
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,640
In like...

2517
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:28,900
Um...

2518
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:29,860
In the little world.

2519
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:30,500
And it's like...

2520
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:31,460
They get to decide...

2521
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,260
If they want to stay in that world.

2522
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:34,280
In that little ball.

2523
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:36,720
Like...

2524
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,220
Come on!

2525
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,520
It's a nice...

2526
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,600
It's a nice world.

2527
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:40,960
It's a nice little world.

2528
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,120
In my little ball.

2529
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,420
Get in here!

2530
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:45,380
Don't worry.

2531
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:47,220
I can Stockholm Syndrome them enough.

2532
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,540
Come on!

2533
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,560
There's fun in here.

2534
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:54,900
There's fun in here.

2535
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,560
All your friends are having fun.

2536
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:03,270
Live in the ball!

2537
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:05,590
You don't have to work...

2538
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:06,930
Don't worry about your family.

2539
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:07,910
They'll be...

2540
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:08,930
They'll be okay.

2541
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:10,190
She can remarry.

2542
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:10,250
Don't worry.

2543
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:14,330
See?

2544
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:14,790
Look!

2545
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:15,810
Look!

2546
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,250
He...

2547
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:17,090
Look!

2548
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:18,370
He accepted his fate.

2549
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,580
An avid sports fan that knows which football is best.

2550
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,940
It uses its head more than many may think.

2551
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,020
But a concussion leaves its mind to be more than desirable.

2552
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:32,980
Holy fuck.

2553
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:33,640
Alright.

2554
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,800
There's no taxes in the ball!

2555
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:39,720
Get in here!

2556
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,180
Alright.

2557
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,420
Who wants to have...

2558
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:42,500
Brain problems?

2559
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,700
Who wants to be my special...

2560
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:46,300
Special little guy?

2561
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:46,460
Johnny might die.

2562
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,240
He...

2563
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,220
I'll take it!

2564
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:53,380
He...

2565
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,080
He...

2566
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:56,560
He...

2567
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,140
Alright.

2568
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:00,180
Let's see.

2569
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:02,880
He...

2570
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:06,240
I hate taxes with me.

2571
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,260
Alright, I'll give it to... Alright.

2572
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:11,960
Roll... Goon.

2573
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,860
Don't worry about the concussions.

2574
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,840
I think there's a doctor in the ball.

2575
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:29,070
Yeah... I don't remember where I've gone.

2576
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,140
And then... Oh wait, no, I came from here.

2577
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:39,720
Yeah, I remember now.

2578
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,340
I came from here, yeah.

2579
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,280
Have I talked to him yet?

2580
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,760
Evil around me is a poser.

2581
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,680
I have... I haven't sent...

2582
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:53,420
But Lord Poser and Morden that isn't... What?

2583
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:55,980
What accent was that?

2584
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,320
I'm so fucking confused.

2585
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,060
What did he say?

2586
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,400
What language was that?

2587
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,260
Huh?

2588
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,240
Yeah, I'm like, excuse me?

2589
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:11,940
I gave up reading that.

2590
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,620
I could barely read in the first place.

2591
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,300
Have I been here?

2592
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,160
No, okay, I haven't.

2593
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:23,600
I love the smell of lava in nondescript time of day.

2594
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,780
Yeah, I think that Koopa is also his...

2595
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:33,840
That's also Lord Bowser's special little guy.

2596
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:38,470
Oh, I forgot.

2597
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:39,130
He's paralyzed.

2598
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:42,250
He jumped off another bed.

2599
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:44,850
Yeah!

2600
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:54,230
T-Rex.

2601
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:55,530
That's the T-Rex, right?

2602
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:58,190
Oh no, it's just a regular guy.

2603
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:59,750
Alright, time to sit.

2604
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:06,020
Forgot the T-Rex is literally called T-Rex.

2605
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:07,880
Yeah!

2606
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,280
Don't worry, he likes it.

2607
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,640
Oh, well, he's dead.

2608
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,660
He liked it too much.

2609
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,220
He spoke the language of Hootenha.

2610
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,840
Meep, thank you for the super chat.

2611
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,260
Thank you.

2612
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:24,980
Is that said...

2613
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:25,860
Okay, rock record.

2614
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,000
Okay, I...

2615
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,840
I was like, wait, what does that say?

2616
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,980
Immobile, next turn.

2617
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:33,400
Okay.

2618
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,000
Oh,

2619
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:38,980
fuck it.

2620
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,580
I was like, excuse me?

2621
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:45,960
How...

2622
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,780
What kind...

2623
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,400
Did they just add that move in?

2624
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,020
I thought that said homewrecker.

2625
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:51,300
I'm like...

2626
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,720
I was like, oh my god!

2627
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,120
Heftly's a homewrecker?

2628
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:01,800
I was like, what kind of move?

2629
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,220
What do you do with that move?

2630
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,000
How do you use it?

2631
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:13,170
Okay, maybe here?

2632
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:15,590
Oh my god, this is Super Mario Bros 3 Bros again.

2633
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:18,170
I saw them again.

2634
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:21,990
What did you do, Heftly?

2635
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:26,090
What did you do to charge his wife?

2636
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,920
No, I'm back here.

2637
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,860
Where am I?

2638
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:38,080
Back here!

2639
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,100
Okay, I haven't gone this way.

2640
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:41,920
Yeah, this is new.

2641
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,100
Mario.

2642
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,780
Okay, thank god.

2643
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,780
This place is new.

2644
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,240
Oh no.

2645
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:01,740
You'll be fine.

2646
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:02,860
Okay, guys.

2647
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,420
I knew you'd be fine.

2648
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:06,760
Power of gambling.

2649
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:08,140
Don't worry, Mario.

2650
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:08,540
Don't worry, Mario.

2651
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:09,580
I'll block the bullet...

2652
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,800
...bullet nails for you.

2653
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:12,280
It won't hurt much.

2654
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,520
Okay.

2655
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,520
That's not blocking, Toad.

2656
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,180
You like, walked away from it.

2657
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,160
That'll be fine.

2658
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,880
Guys, it's not like I have another 10k lying around, guys.

2659
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,200
He'll be fine, guys.

2660
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,360
Oh my god.

2661
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:43,530
Okay.

2662
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,110
Wait, I need to fight him.

2663
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:50,490
Get blasted, nerd!

2664
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,220
Plumber!

2665
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:59,320
Okay.

2666
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,920
He can survive this.

2667
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:03,060
Yay!

2668
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:04,820
Gambling!

2669
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:13,810
See, I told you guys.

2670
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:15,550
I knew it.

2671
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,910
I knew he could survive this.

2672
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:20,670
But what's on the left side?

2673
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:26,530
What's on this side?

2674
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:27,990
Oh, I need the key.

2675
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:28,470
Okay.

2676
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:31,730
So maybe the left side will get me the key then.

2677
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:39,110
Okay, no.

2678
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:41,070
Where the fuck am I?

2679
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:47,080
Okay, I know where that...

2680
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,440
Okay, so I know...

2681
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,360
I know that's where the actual door is.

2682
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,960
Now I just need to find the key.

2683
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,320
Okay, now I'm back here.

2684
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:57,340
God fucking...

2685
01:48:57,340 --> 01:48:57,480
Okay.

2686
01:48:58,480 --> 01:48:59,660
Where the fuck is the key?

2687
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:06,470
Drop through the lava squares?

2688
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:07,490
Oh, yeah!

2689
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,110
They're like, you can drop through!

2690
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:11,250
But where?

2691
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:12,570
But where?

2692
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:12,750
Where...

2693
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:13,510
Where...

2694
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:18,470
Oh my god.

2695
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:20,270
This is why his wife left him.

2696
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:26,130
His wife was like, please, Bowser.

2697
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:29,330
Please.

2698
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:34,870
We gotta spend the money on...

2699
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:37,150
Oh, it's your whole wallet.

2700
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:38,810
We gotta spend the money...

2701
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:40,230
On the...

2702
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:43,330
On our fucking A plus kids college fund.

2703
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:45,230
It's like...

2704
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:48,210
And then he's like, no, our castle needs to be bigger.

2705
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:50,530
Wait.

2706
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:52,250
I'm back in the...

2707
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:53,070
Oh my god.

2708
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:56,030
I'm back in the basement.

2709
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:58,810
Are you...

2710
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:00,290
Are you...

2711
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:08,150
Actually, I don't even think his wife left him.

2712
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:10,590
I think he lost his wife in this house somewhere.

2713
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:19,590
I think maybe he just lost his wife in this house.

2714
01:50:21,090 --> 01:50:24,170
Like, maybe I'll just find Bowser's wife somewhere here.

2715
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:28,230
Oh my god.

2716
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:29,190
His wife is still here.

2717
01:50:31,730 --> 01:50:33,390
Maybe the castle is his wife?

2718
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:34,850
Oh, like some monster house shit?

2719
01:50:37,170 --> 01:50:38,430
Alright, I'll follow it.

2720
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,190
Where is this area?

2721
01:50:43,290 --> 01:50:44,850
Where is this area?

2722
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:47,350
Where the fuck is this area?

2723
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:48,810
Oh my god.

2724
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,630
Oh my god.

2725
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,270
I'm so tired.

2726
01:50:59,460 --> 01:50:59,980
I'm so tired.

2727
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:02,040
Okay, does it take me back to the rest area?

2728
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:04,080
Okay, nice.

2729
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,400
Okay, I'm putting the E-gag thing on.

2730
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:14,160
Alright.

2731
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:15,260
This is the...

2732
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,700
This is the worst area for the most directionally...

2733
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:20,020
Directionally challenged bird.

2734
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,280
Oh my god, where did I come from?

2735
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,200
I don't remember.

2736
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:38,240
They all look the same.

2737
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:40,620
Oh, these doors look the same.

2738
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,280
I don't remember.

2739
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,140
They all look the fucking same.

2740
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,020
Did I?

2741
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:46,380
Okay.

2742
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:47,580
I don't think I've been here.

2743
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,460
Okay, this is new.

2744
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,100
Oh, thank god.

2745
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:50,980
Okay, this is new.

2746
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:52,920
Mario, you're here.

2747
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:53,880
Then that means...

2748
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,040
Ha!

2749
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,680
You beat Power Plunk.

2750
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:57,480
I hope he wasn't too easy.

2751
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,380
Because I'm not holding back.

2752
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:03,700
It's like a fucking face or something.

2753
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:09,820
Okay, I figured it out.

2754
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:20,300
Oh, thank god.

2755
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:20,960
Okay.

2756
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:25,160
What the fuck?

2757
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,460
That took half my HP!

2758
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:29,520
Did he, like, explode?

2759
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,420
Like, is it intestines?

2760
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,580
They're, like, on dad's, like, fucking skin?

2761
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,700
And it, like...

2762
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:37,120
And, like, he just has trauma?

2763
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,520
From what he did?

2764
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:42,160
What the fuck does Inner Town even mean?

2765
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,900
I just popped a balloon?

2766
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:57,220
Oh, no.

2767
01:52:57,380 --> 01:52:57,780
It's okay.

2768
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:58,700
He moves...

2769
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:59,400
He's fast enough.

2770
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,800
I told you, guys.

2771
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:02,560
If I level him enough...

2772
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,920
He'll eventually be fast enough.

2773
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:13,410
Oh, my god.

2774
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,950
He ends it with Goomastack?

2775
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:16,050
That's so sad.

2776
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:25,010
It's like, you know, you know, his, like, relatives and, like, cousins and nephews and nieces need a job.

2777
01:53:25,230 --> 01:53:28,810
And then he's like, I guess you can, like, be in my party, you know?

2778
01:53:31,330 --> 01:53:32,790
Alright, we got the bubble key.

2779
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:36,910
Alright, nice.

2780
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:39,690
Wait, but why?

2781
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:41,570
Why?

2782
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:42,550
Why put me back here?

2783
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:45,250
Just a scape rope back.

2784
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:54,020
Alright, here.

2785
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:55,500
Heal dad now.

2786
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:04,660
Alright.

2787
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:05,960
Oh, shit.

2788
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:06,620
No.

2789
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:07,820
Not here.

2790
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:10,400
Okay, now I have the key.

2791
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:14,360
I think I got all the captures, right?

2792
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:15,820
Pretty sure.

2793
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:20,650
Alright.

2794
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:21,650
Nice.

2795
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:22,990
Now we're in the third room.

2796
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:25,610
Wait.

2797
01:54:25,810 --> 01:54:27,210
We're not in the third room?

2798
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:28,870
Where are we?

2799
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:32,570
Alright, I just want to be sure if there's anything new here.

2800
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:35,030
Alright, fall off the roof.

2801
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:36,350
And then...

2802
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:36,910
Oh, okay.

2803
01:54:39,190 --> 01:54:40,730
I'll just use that again then.

2804
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:41,510
Alright, nice.

2805
01:54:42,730 --> 01:54:44,730
You beat Power Blanc and Goomp?

2806
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,930
Look, I'm one day away from vacation.

2807
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:48,870
And one step away from lava.

2808
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:51,030
So let's not drag this out.

2809
01:54:57,730 --> 01:54:58,270
Alright.

2810
01:54:59,450 --> 01:54:59,990
Final...

2811
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:01,030
Final Goon.

2812
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:06,170
Get that Final Goon out of here.

2813
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,930
No, my money!

2814
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:13,870
I'm gonna pay my mortgage now!

2815
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,180
I wonder...

2816
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:23,380
Okay.

2817
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,380
If you, like, put...

2818
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:27,800
If you put them in the ball...

2819
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,620
You don't have to feed them, right?

2820
01:55:33,810 --> 01:55:36,310
I assume, like, if we're Pokemon lore...

2821
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:40,730
Like, they never have to be fed again if they're in the Pokeball and you put them in a box.

2822
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:43,470
You do?

2823
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:45,570
What about all the boxed Pokemons?

2824
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,190
Yeah, they can't get hungry if they're in the PC.

2825
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:53,170
Right?

2826
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:54,390
They're just data.

2827
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:59,300
They die?!

2828
01:55:59,300 --> 01:55:59,980
They die?!

2829
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:06,250
Who the fuck is feeding Ash's Poke...

2830
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,120
Oh,

2831
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:16,030
they're at a ranch?!

2832
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:18,370
I have to pay rent for...

2833
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:19,690
I have to pay...

2834
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:21,290
Ranch feed?!

2835
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:28,390
Yeah, but who's paying Professor Oak?!

2836
01:56:29,530 --> 01:56:31,430
Ash is not paying shit.

2837
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:32,450
He's still 10.

2838
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:40,460
All right.

2839
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:41,760
That should be...

2840
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:43,920
Wait, where's Bowser's area?

2841
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:45,560
Oh!

2842
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,920
Oh, it's at the main gate.

2843
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:47,260
Okay.

2844
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,120
I was, like, a little confused.

2845
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,200
I have the spirit.

2846
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,860
I'm just a little confused.

2847
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:57,640
Yeah, but what...

2848
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:58,940
What does his mom do?

2849
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:01,460
What job does his mom have?

2850
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:10,130
I mean, I guess if you start losing money, you can just eat one of your Pokemon.

2851
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:15,890
Mario!

2852
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,280
Quit your yelling.

2853
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,660
Your brother isn't gonna save you this time.

2854
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:25,060
I mean, that's what Magikarp is.

2855
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:26,960
They're just fish.

2856
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:29,960
Yeah, quit your yelling.

2857
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:34,140
You're gonna stay blocked up till Papa and Pizza gets here.

2858
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,560
You actually want a pizza, bro?

2859
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:39,160
Wait, you still kidnapped me.

2860
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:41,820
I didn't even get a chance to command my catchers.

2861
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,040
This isn't fair!

2862
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:44,440
Fair?

2863
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,780
Who said anything about fair?

2864
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:48,780
Ha ha ha.

2865
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:49,820
He he he.

2866
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:51,060
Papa!

2867
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:55,560
I trapped him and took his Power Stars and caps, just like you asked.

2868
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,180
Bowser, this was your plan?

2869
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,740
Of course I planned this.

2870
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,720
That's my kind of thing.

2871
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:08,580
I helped you get the Power Stars so I could take them for myself in the end.

2872
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,560
I thought what we had was special, bro.

2873
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,980
Where are none of our memories together real?

2874
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:17,600
Ha ha ha.

2875
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:19,700
You can't be serious.

2876
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,340
Get a load of this guy.

2877
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:26,540
And then Luigi has trust issues for the rest of his life.

2878
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:27,400
Yippee.

2879
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,780
Yeah, what a chump.

2880
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,780
Lord Bowser really played you.

2881
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:32,880
No.

2882
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:36,700
I'm always the bad guy.

2883
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:39,280
You shouldn't trust me.

2884
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:42,320
Is that really what you want?

2885
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,660
I got what I wanted.

2886
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:50,540
Mario!

2887
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:51,680
You're here!

2888
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,120
Bowser trapped me and took all my stuff.

2889
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:59,200
Also, do you have your emergency pizza stash?

2890
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:02,000
Papa didn't trap you!

2891
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,160
I did!

2892
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:04,940
Grrrr!

2893
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:05,560
Papa!

2894
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,700
I wanna fight Mario!

2895
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,320
Let me show you how strong I am!

2896
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,640
Junior, you have a very important job.

2897
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:16,960
I'll make sure Luigi doesn't escape.

2898
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:19,000
And keeping Comic entertained.

2899
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,480
Yes, and I haven't been here the whole time, your rashness.

2900
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:25,580
Mario is my rival!

2901
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:30,520
And I'll not let this mushroom-munching, CAPTURE CRUSHING!

2902
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,480
BRICK BREAKING!

2903
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,920
SOULMATE STEALING!

2904
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,460
PARKING BIN HERO!

2905
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,840
RUIN MY PLANS AGAIN!

2906
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,900
Comic, have you assembled...

2907
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,040
THE TEAM?

2908
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,740
YES, MY CAP CHAMPION!

2909
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,240
OH MY GOD!

2910
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:55,980
Comic has crafted the strongest party ever!

2911
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:59,300
This battle will mark your reign, Mario!

2912
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:03,120
And I will finally have my wish!

2913
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:08,780
I mean, you can have Peach if you want.

2914
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,580
I mean, there's so many options.

2915
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:12,140
I mean...

2916
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:15,320
My ex-girlfriend, Pauline...

2917
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:17,540
I think she wants me back.

2918
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:19,200
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2919
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:21,860
Okay.

2920
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,160
I'll say it.

2921
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,740
I think...

2922
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,120
I think I'd pick Pauline over...

2923
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:29,000
Princess Peach.

2924
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:31,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

2925
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:32,660
Ha ha ha ha!

2926
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,020
Better!

2927
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:36,400
Thank you for the reign!

2928
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:37,180
Thank you!

2929
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,160
Thank you!

2930
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:41,120
Thank you!

2931
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:42,540
I hope you had a great stream!

2932
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:43,040
Better!

2933
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,740
I'm fighting Bowser right now.

2934
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,820
In my Super Mario mind.

2935
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,080
I'm also...

2936
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:52,860
I also...

2937
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:54,760
My hot take today was that...

2938
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:57,900
I think Pauline is a better girlfriend than Princess Peach.

2939
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:01,600
Because at least she doesn't get kidnapped all the time!

2940
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:04,800
Bro, and she's...

2941
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:08,120
Okay, to be fair, Princess Peach is like Queen of Toad Town.

2942
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:09,980
But like Queen of the Toads.

2943
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:12,840
But then she's also Queen of the Toads.

2944
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:14,100
Like...

2945
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:14,940
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2946
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,640
That's the thing.

2947
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:18,420
She is Queen.

2948
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,420
But she's also Queen of the Toads.

2949
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:22,600
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2950
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:27,860
Yeah, but she got kidnapped one time!

2951
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:29,860
And then she learned her lesson!

2952
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:33,120
She learned not to have that happen again!

2953
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:39,570
Alright.

2954
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:40,970
That's right.

2955
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:42,490
Time to sit on him.

2956
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:48,970
Also, like...

2957
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:50,010
Pauline has like...

2958
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:50,570
Oh, shit.

2959
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:50,970
Okay.

2960
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:53,210
I guess I don't sit on him!

2961
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:54,050
Oh, fuck!

2962
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:55,170
Oh!

2963
02:01:57,570 --> 02:01:58,130
Whoa!

2964
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:00,390
You know what?

2965
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:01,310
I trust Hefli.

2966
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:05,150
So far...

2967
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:05,390
Okay.

2968
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:05,890
True.

2969
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:07,830
But like...

2970
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:08,250
Okay.

2971
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,670
Time to use the homewrecker.

2972
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,610
You got this, Hefli.

2973
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:18,240
Don't worry.

2974
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:19,900
You know where his wife is, right?

2975
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:19,920
Alright.

2976
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:23,940
Haha.

2977
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:28,020
Hahaha!

2978
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:30,520
Kamik said he made the strongest party.

2979
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,780
Just because he's in it.

2980
02:02:39,070 --> 02:02:40,150
He nodded!

2981
02:02:40,510 --> 02:02:40,710
Hahaha!

2982
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:42,490
He knows!

2983
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:43,910
Hahaha!

2984
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:50,390
Alright.

2985
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:53,070
Okay, the only biggest issue right now...

2986
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:54,650
Is that Dad is out of commission!

2987
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:57,790
And like, he's still gonna... Okay, I trust you.

2988
02:02:58,150 --> 02:03:01,290
I trust you, my son, that I keep in the attic.

2989
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:04,490
My attic son.

2990
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:06,090
Where no one knows.

2991
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:07,590
Oh my god, Mecha Chop?

2992
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:08,590
What the fuck?

2993
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:10,490
Where did that guy come from?

2994
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:13,490
Mother.

2995
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,540
Oh my god, that's fine.

2996
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,660
Now I... Okay, now I fight Bowser.

2997
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:28,520
Okay.

2998
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:29,120
Okay.

2999
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:30,980
Alright, I believe in you.

3000
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:35,120
Oh.

3001
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:36,880
Wait, you're dragon?

3002
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,000
But you get hurt by dragon moves?

3003
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,240
Why are you your own weakness?

3004
02:03:50,130 --> 02:03:51,190
Oh my god.

3005
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:52,910
Guys, I...

3006
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:55,410
I didn't know.

3007
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:55,970
Alright.

3008
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:58,490
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

3009
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:06,170
Okay, where is it?

3010
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:09,530
Where is it?

3011
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:10,430
Don't worry.

3012
02:04:11,550 --> 02:04:14,170
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

3013
02:04:16,450 --> 02:04:18,450
It better not be.

3014
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:23,290
Die for the cause, my attic son.

3015
02:04:24,370 --> 02:04:24,830
Goodbye.

3016
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:27,470
Die.

3017
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,160
Yay.

3018
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:32,500
Dad's back.

3019
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:38,180
Alright, Storm's real.

3020
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:42,660
Look, Dad needs more XP, guys.

3021
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,700
Look, he's so hungry.

3022
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:44,580
He's...

3023
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:48,240
He's starving, guys.

3024
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:50,460
He needs more XP.

3025
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:51,940
Look at him.

3026
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:54,840
He could have been level 70 right now.

3027
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:56,380
Holy fuck.

3028
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:57,400
Oh my god.

3029
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:57,800
Okay.

3030
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:00,060
He's so hungry, guys.

3031
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:02,340
Oh, this is bad.

3032
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:02,920
That's fine.

3033
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:07,060
He's so hungry.

3034
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:07,920
He needs more.

3035
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,760
No, no, no.

3036
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,440
We have max mushroom.

3037
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:22,960
There you go.

3038
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,220
It was worth it.

3039
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:26,800
It was so worth it, guys.

3040
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,100
Okay, as long as, like...

3041
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:34,240
As long as that doesn't do a critical hit, we're so fine.

3042
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:35,860
Nice.

3043
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:36,120
See?

3044
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:36,880
Look at that.

3045
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:43,520
He's so hungry, guys.

3046
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:44,540
He needs more food.

3047
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,300
Okay, Sumo, bro.

3048
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,520
I should be faster than him.

3049
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:53,280
Statistically, I should be.

3050
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:53,960
Like, we're...

3051
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,420
They're both, like, big bone.

3052
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:56,560
Oh, okay.

3053
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:56,760
Never.

3054
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:57,060
Goodbye.

3055
02:05:58,220 --> 02:05:58,620
Goodbye.

3056
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:02,280
Alright.

3057
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:03,140
That's fine.

3058
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,800
Oh, wait.

3059
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,720
He should be...

3060
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:10,140
Oh, fuck.

3061
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,000
Oh, wait.

3062
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:11,220
No.

3063
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:11,460
Never.

3064
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:12,140
Goodbye, Heffley.

3065
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:13,660
I might have fucked up there.

3066
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:14,460
No, you're faster.

3067
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:15,380
You should be faster.

3068
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:24,000
It's okay.

3069
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:24,660
It's fine.

3070
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:25,580
He just has one more.

3071
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:29,820
Okay, Mecha Chomp.

3072
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:30,320
You know what?

3073
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:31,540
I believe.

3074
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:36,920
Brown is stronger than metal, right?

3075
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:43,780
What's...

3076
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:44,660
How high, horse?

3077
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:48,060
I don't know what this does.

3078
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,780
Oh.

3079
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:52,800
Oh.

3080
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:56,760
Whoops.

3081
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:04,280
I knew you won't disappoint me.

3082
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:06,440
My son that gets to be out in public.

3083
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:07,040
Right?

3084
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:08,660
Damn it.

3085
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:11,020
You better not be laughing because I'm not.

3086
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:14,880
No.

3087
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:20,220
Give Papa some space.

3088
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:24,220
It's clear that I can't beat you.

3089
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:27,200
Not even what the strongest team come I can make.

3090
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,580
Why is that?

3091
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,320
Am I really that weak?

3092
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:33,080
Am I not a great commander and leader?

3093
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:39,220
Bro, you just don't have the power of friendship and love.

3094
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,500
Bowser, you're stronger than you think.

3095
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:46,080
I think I speak for all of us when I sing.

3096
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:48,520
We are terrified of your power, bro.

3097
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:51,040
Bro, you may not be great at this game.

3098
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,820
That doesn't mean you're weak.

3099
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:56,580
I supported you through your journey since the Jungle Kingdom.

3100
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:59,300
And I hope I helped you become stronger.

3101
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:01,400
Wow, what a real bro.

3102
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:02,840
Luigi.

3103
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,140
Hmm.

3104
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:06,760
I mean...

3105
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,120
Green Stash!

3106
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:10,520
This is like...

3107
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:12,140
A doomed yaoi!

3108
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:13,600
Ha ha ha ha!

3109
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:16,660
This is like...

3110
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:17,920
Unrequented love.

3111
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,000
Bowser's chasing after Peach.

3112
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:21,400
But he has...

3113
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:24,060
He already has his soulmate right there.

3114
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:25,340
Waiting for him.

3115
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:26,200
Ha ha ha ha!

3116
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:29,300
That might be the smartest thing you have ever said.

3117
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:31,960
How could I be so stupid?

3118
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:32,840
Hm.

3119
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:36,420
I was so blinded by competition.

3120
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:39,520
That I didn't realize I grabbed my own wits.

3121
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:44,140
Thank you for reminding me that I have eight power stars and you don't!

3122
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:46,880
Who cares about a wish from Peaches?

3123
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:50,460
My wish right now is to destroy you!

3124
02:08:50,700 --> 02:08:51,680
Right here!

3125
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,980
Right now!

3126
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:58,640
What the fuck?

3127
02:08:58,960 --> 02:08:59,800
He can just...

3128
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:00,540
Do that?

3129
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:01,220
Luigi!

3130
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:01,860
What the fuck?

3131
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:03,340
You had eight power stars all on!

3132
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:04,540
You didn't go big!

3133
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:08,780
I'm going to turn you into a fine red mist!

3134
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,700
Not unless you turn me into a fine green mist!

3135
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,120
I'll not let you fight Bowser by yourself!

3136
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,960
This is my fight too!

3137
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,620
Ha ha ha ha!

3138
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:22,000
I will end the Mario Brothers!

3139
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,380
Let's go, bro!

3140
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:27,760
Wait, guys!

3141
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:28,220
Guys!

3142
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:30,040
Wait, wait a minute!

3143
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:30,380
Oh, wait!

3144
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:31,440
Oh, he's fully healed!

3145
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:31,880
Thank God!

3146
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:34,320
And you bring out your Goomba stack!

3147
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:36,640
As the first one!

3148
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:37,720
Ha ha ha!

3149
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:40,640
Bro!

3150
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:45,000
Why didn't you bring out your starter?

3151
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:46,760
Ha ha ha!

3152
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:52,540
Why didn't you bring out that Goomba stack?

3153
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,220
What are you gonna do?

3154
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,240
Walk very, very...

3155
02:09:58,380 --> 02:09:59,800
Ha ha ha!

3156
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,840
Ha ha ha!

3157
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:05,900
Ha ha ha!

3158
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:06,360
This is it.

3159
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:14,410
All right.

3160
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:17,910
Impressive.

3161
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:19,530
Wait, can I catch him?

3162
02:10:21,810 --> 02:10:22,890
Ha ha ha!

3163
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:23,670
Is he...

3164
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:25,550
He technically is wild, right?

3165
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:27,630
Ha ha ha!

3166
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:29,290
Oh, I can't.

3167
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:30,190
Unlucky.

3168
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:35,890
Why is he hitting me and not the Goomba...

3169
02:10:35,890 --> 02:10:37,770
Oh, of course he fucking gets the last...

3170
02:10:37,770 --> 02:10:38,570
The killing move.

3171
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:39,470
Of course he does.

3172
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:42,070
Of course the Goomba stack gets the kill...

3173
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:43,450
After everything I did.

3174
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:46,010
After I was the one that got the crit move.

3175
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:46,830
Ha ha ha!

3176
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:52,570
I just didn't gain 2 XP for that?

3177
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:53,330
No!

3178
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:54,550
This...

3179
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:55,650
This isn't...

3180
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:56,330
Happening!

3181
02:10:56,550 --> 02:10:58,530
The Goomba stack MVP.

3182
02:10:59,070 --> 02:11:00,930
Of course he fucking kill steals me.

3183
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:02,830
You know what this is happening?

3184
02:11:03,250 --> 02:11:04,810
Me kicking your butt!

3185
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:08,110
This is for stealing my power stars!

3186
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:10,910
This is for bullying my brother!

3187
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:14,370
And this is for breaking my heart!

3188
02:11:14,570 --> 02:11:16,310
Ha ha ha ha!

3189
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:18,010
Ha ha ha ha!

3190
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:18,830
Okay, at least...

3191
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,350
Ha ha ha!

3192
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:20,690
Okay, I need to pee.

3193
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:21,970
I can't be a sec.

3194
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:14,930
Okay, that...

3195
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:15,950
Ha ha ha!

3196
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:17,690
Ha ha ha!

3197
02:12:18,170 --> 02:12:18,750
No!

3198
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:19,810
Luigi!

3199
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:22,570
Oh, Luigi!

3200
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:23,150
Oh, Luigi!

3201
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:23,970
Oh, my God!

3202
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:26,810
He is going through his...

3203
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:29,190
Heartbreak right now!

3204
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:31,710
Alan, forward, fight size!

3205
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:33,190
Thank you for the super chat!

3206
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:34,010
Thank you!

3207
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:34,910
Thank you!

3208
02:12:35,310 --> 02:12:36,410
Oh, no!

3209
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:39,270
We loved you!

3210
02:12:39,850 --> 02:12:40,190
Ha ha ha!

3211
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:41,250
Why?

3212
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:42,890
You are breaking his heart!

3213
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:44,150
Ha ha ha!

3214
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:45,090
I'm sorry!

3215
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:47,210
I'm sorry!

3216
02:12:48,070 --> 02:12:48,530
I'm sorry!

3217
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:51,150
He did everything for you!

3218
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:52,610
Ha ha ha!

3219
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,910
Ha ha!

3220
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:56,150
Hey!

3221
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:58,110
Luigi, my friend!

3222
02:12:58,810 --> 02:12:59,350
FRIEND!

3223
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:00,110
Ha ha ha!

3224
02:13:00,730 --> 02:13:05,590
Let's say we forget about all this and go back to playing in the Cap challenge!

3225
02:13:05,970 --> 02:13:06,610
Oh my God!

3226
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:07,870
And he said friend!

3227
02:13:08,710 --> 02:13:09,610
Poor Luigi!

3228
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:13,170
How are you gonna recover from a broken heart?

3229
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:17,950
And he gets friendzoned too.

3230
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:19,710
Oh, bro.

3231
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:25,670
Together.

3232
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:28,710
Come on, just me and you.

3233
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:32,830
I think I'm ready to break up our partnership.

3234
02:13:33,230 --> 02:13:34,530
It's not you.

3235
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:36,730
No, it is you.

3236
02:13:36,890 --> 02:13:37,750
It's not me.

3237
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:40,350
I'll give it you on my heart.

3238
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:40,350
What?

3239
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,970
Luigi deserves better.

3240
02:13:44,330 --> 02:13:46,450
He thought he could fix him, guys.

3241
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:49,470
Luigi thought he could fix him.

3242
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:51,330
But he's not fixable.

3243
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:53,950
You are with me, bro.

3244
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:55,630
Don't worry, bro.

3245
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:57,530
I'll get you a rebound.

3246
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:01,450
It's not the same.

3247
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:08,310
All Luigi wants was a 10 feet tall turtle monster.

3248
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:13,470
This isn't the end.

3249
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:15,710
It's not the same, guys.

3250
02:14:16,030 --> 02:14:17,290
Daisy just doesn't...

3251
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:20,150
Unless she turns into the elephant.

3252
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:23,290
We did it, bro.

3253
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,420
I got my power stars back.

3254
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:32,200
As well as the ones assigned to the Molten Kingdom.

3255
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:34,200
Here, this one is yours.

3256
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:38,120
Casting you in the super chat.

3257
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:39,160
Thank you, thank you.

3258
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:40,380
Oh my god.

3259
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:44,800
Bowser Jr. had to witness another divorce, guys.

3260
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:52,740
Poor Bowser Jr. He's only a little guy and he went through two divorces.

3261
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:02,360
I'm happy I spent time with Bowser.

3262
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:06,160
He'll never forget the memories, guys.

3263
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:10,280
Even though he said he wanted me for my power stars.

3264
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:12,620
I don't think that's all that true.

3265
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:17,960
I really believed we were having fun together with the cap challenge.

3266
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:20,900
And that we were becoming friends.

3267
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:22,600
Maybe more friends.

3268
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,880
He said in his heart.

3269
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:34,600
But, I'm sorry.

3270
02:15:34,980 --> 02:15:36,600
That was ignorant to everything.

3271
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:39,240
And that caused you so much trouble.

3272
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:43,160
I was looking through everything with gross tinted glasses.

3273
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:48,820
But, didn't realize that he was already a flag, bro.

3274
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,360
I really believed I became stronger as a person through this game.

3275
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:58,980
And I'm all ready to prove that for you.

3276
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:07,340
What's that sound?

3277
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,620
The power stars.

3278
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:09,160
There.

3279
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:13,680
A voice rings out of, from nowhere.

3280
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,580
Bearer of all eight power stars.

3281
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,780
Return to Toetown at once.

3282
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:21,760
And board the ship in the west of town.

3283
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:25,000
From there, go to the Mushroom King Hill.

3284
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,240
Where your final challenge awaits.

3285
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:29,240
Our final challenge!

3286
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:31,480
We have to head to Toetown quick!

3287
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:34,680
Now, don't keep me waiting, bro.

3288
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,040
Let's see who can get the wish first.

3289
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:39,960
Alright, we did it.

3290
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:42,540
We beat up Luigi's ex-boyfriend.

3291
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:44,580
I told him.

3292
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,600
I told him he wasn't good for him.

3293
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:48,720
But Luigi was like, no, bro.

3294
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,300
I can fix him.

3295
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:50,960
Please.

3296
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:54,080
You just don't know him behind...

3297
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:55,540
Behind closed doors.

3298
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,760
Betty, thank you for the super chat.

3299
02:17:01,060 --> 02:17:01,880
Thank you, thank you.

3300
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:04,500
He is nice to me.

3301
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,160
Bro, you don't understand.

3302
02:17:10,380 --> 02:17:11,560
I was like...

3303
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,060
Is this what you want to do to your mama?

3304
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:17,560
You're breaking on your mama's power heart.

3305
02:17:23,180 --> 02:17:23,780
What?

3306
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:26,500
I shouldn't even think what you were like on Tumblr.

3307
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:32,120
Stop inserting, dude.

3308
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:32,740
Wait!

3309
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,640
He was the one that said...

3310
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:36,420
You broke my heart!

3311
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:39,020
What the fuck was I supposed to infer with that?

3312
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:41,600
Luigi literally was like...

3313
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:43,860
You broke my heart, palsy!

3314
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:46,160
What was I supposed to...

3315
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,960
What was I supposed to say with that?

3316
02:17:51,610 --> 02:17:52,940
Okay, let's see.

3317
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:55,520
Get the warp...

3318
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:56,060
Wait, what?

3319
02:17:57,710 --> 02:17:58,720
How can I leave?

3320
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:01,480
Warp back here.

3321
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:06,980
You're supposed to infer friendship.

3322
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:11,960
Just friends.

3323
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:17,040
Make way for Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom!

3324
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:19,240
Princess Toadstool!

3325
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:22,100
They're just really good friends.

3326
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:23,440
Some say roommates.

3327
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:25,340
Mario...

3328
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,140
You've done wonderfully.

3329
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:30,520
Thank you so much for defeating Bowser.

3330
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:35,040
How do you know about your deeds in the Molten Kingdom?

3331
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:36,340
Ho ho!

3332
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:37,460
Did you not hear?

3333
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,260
The call of the Power Stars.

3334
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:41,160
Once you collected all in.

3335
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:43,700
All involved in the cap challenge.

3336
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:46,220
Heard the call, Master Mario.

3337
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:47,300
As such!

3338
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:49,660
We're off to Mushroom here in...

3339
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:50,400
Who's taste?

3340
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:51,600
That's right!

3341
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:53,100
Do you want to come...

3342
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:53,300
Oh wait.

3343
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:54,060
That's right.

3344
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:55,860
Do you want to come with us, Mario?

3345
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:57,880
We have a boat prepared already.

3346
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,120
Then...

3347
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:00,540
Just follow us.

3348
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:02,720
Alright.

3349
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:03,600
That's cool.

3350
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,190
Oh, there's the boat!

3351
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:11,990
A princess!

3352
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:13,330
Toadsworth!

3353
02:19:13,650 --> 02:19:15,550
What brings you to my humble docks?

3354
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:18,490
Bring us to Mushroom Hill, young seller!

3355
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:19,710
Who's taste?

3356
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:21,970
Of course!

3357
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:22,850
Toadsworth!

3358
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:24,090
Go right on the hill!

3359
02:19:27,090 --> 02:19:28,310
I don't know.

3360
02:19:28,850 --> 02:19:30,970
Thanks for accompanying us, Mario.

3361
02:19:31,510 --> 02:19:32,750
Really, you must be going.

3362
02:19:33,150 --> 02:19:35,450
As we have a business to attend to at Mushroom Hill.

3363
02:19:36,310 --> 02:19:36,810
Here, though.

3364
02:19:37,150 --> 02:19:38,350
Take this as thanks.

3365
02:19:38,730 --> 02:19:40,330
Oh yeah, I got Max Bean.

3366
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:42,870
We'll never catch a boo, guys.

3367
02:19:43,290 --> 02:19:45,250
I hope that will help you on your challenge.

3368
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:46,490
Wait, did I catch a boo?

3369
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:47,470
No, we did, right?

3370
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:49,190
I don't remember.

3371
02:19:49,350 --> 02:19:50,110
We caught so many.

3372
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:52,670
Oh, Mr. Broken Bond.

3373
02:19:52,770 --> 02:19:53,510
Thank you for the super chat.

3374
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:53,830
Thank you.

3375
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:54,430
Thank you.

3376
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:57,350
If one got bit by a snake, do you think the other one?

3377
02:19:58,470 --> 02:19:59,490
Good luck, Mario.

3378
02:19:59,830 --> 02:20:00,630
You'll need it.

3379
02:20:02,530 --> 02:20:02,970
Mario.

3380
02:20:04,910 --> 02:20:05,830
Alright, that's...

3381
02:20:05,830 --> 02:20:07,030
I should've used that voice.

3382
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:09,310
All these stories are top-notch!

3383
02:20:09,530 --> 02:20:11,730
I knew I could count on Mushroom Hill.

3384
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:13,370
We're nothing but the greatest.

3385
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:16,250
Hey, Mario!

3386
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:17,170
Remember me?

3387
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:19,150
I'm the first toad from 1-2!

3388
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:21,130
I managed to get all eight...

3389
02:20:21,130 --> 02:20:22,150
Wait, there's no way.

3390
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:23,570
There's no way.

3391
02:20:23,730 --> 02:20:23,970
How?

3392
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:24,550
What?

3393
02:20:25,970 --> 02:20:27,910
How were you able to get all eight Power Stars?

3394
02:20:28,050 --> 02:20:29,750
I did not see you in the Multi Kingdom.

3395
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:32,550
How were you able to beat Bowser Jr.?

3396
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:33,910
Oh man.

3397
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:36,690
I can't wait to see the final battles of the Cap Challenge.

3398
02:20:37,330 --> 02:20:40,390
Professor E-Gag has set up a way for us to watch the event live.

3399
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,690
It's gonna be awesome.

3400
02:20:42,390 --> 02:20:44,510
I wonder who's gonna be a victor of the Cap Challenge.

3401
02:20:44,730 --> 02:20:45,110
You?

3402
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:45,750
Your brother?

3403
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:47,630
Maybe someone else entirely?

3404
02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:50,910
Bro, the acid paid to win.

3405
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:51,550
There's no way.

3406
02:20:51,690 --> 02:20:52,890
I refuse to believe.

3407
02:20:54,210 --> 02:20:55,590
This off a Silver Glem?

3408
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:57,370
What the fuck does a Battle Cap do?

3409
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,180
Okay, that's a TM shop.

3410
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:04,140
Oh, take my picture!

3411
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:06,120
Oh.

3412
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:08,120
Come give us a comment before your big battle!

3413
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,320
Oh, I already talked to him.

3414
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:17,000
So much to do in order to prepare, am I right?

3415
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:19,860
Wonder what these battle caps I get for you.

3416
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:21,540
I'm sorry!

3417
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:23,860
You're not paying with level caps enabled!

3418
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:24,800
Don't you like?

3419
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:25,660
Oh.

3420
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:27,500
No.

3421
02:21:29,220 --> 02:21:31,920
I'll make sure, like, I don't accidentally turn that on.

3422
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:35,720
No.

3423
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:36,280
No.

3424
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:37,240
Okay, I have to...

3425
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:38,280
Like, that's so scary.

3426
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:41,940
I can't spam because I could accidentally turn it on.

3427
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:46,860
I have to be careful with that.

3428
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:47,900
Help me!

3429
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:48,420
Help me!

3430
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:48,980
I serve you!

3431
02:21:49,740 --> 02:21:50,080
Okay.

3432
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:52,000
That guy's a cookie guy.

3433
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,100
Oh!

3434
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,400
My fortune told!

3435
02:21:59,910 --> 02:22:00,430
Okay.

3436
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:01,910
Hello.

3437
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:02,870
Tell my fortune.

3438
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:06,730
If you offer me a battle cap, I can raise the potential of your capture.

3439
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:08,410
Oh, I don't have any.

3440
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:09,370
Alright.

3441
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:13,430
Yeah, I know I can spam B, but I'm so paranoid.

3442
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:16,250
I'm way too paranoid.

3443
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:17,530
Wait, is that Metal Sonic?

3444
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:18,690
Who's that?

3445
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:21,450
I wonder if he's here.

3446
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:22,250
Luigi.

3447
02:22:23,010 --> 02:22:23,990
Please don't hold...

3448
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:25,090
Oh wait, is that Kamek?

3449
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:27,910
Please don't hold it against us.

3450
02:22:28,350 --> 02:22:28,950
Win this.

3451
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,090
Challenge for us.

3452
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:33,070
He looked like Metal Sonic from this perspective.

3453
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:36,150
It's just a Koopa admin.

3454
02:22:37,250 --> 02:22:39,110
I was like, what the fuck is that?

3455
02:22:42,770 --> 02:22:44,230
Oh, yeah, I should buy...

3456
02:22:44,230 --> 02:22:45,090
Oh, I should buy a cap.

3457
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,510
You're right.

3458
02:22:45,850 --> 02:22:46,050
Okay.

3459
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:47,450
It's right here.

3460
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:48,470
And then we'll...

3461
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:49,990
We'll raise the potential.

3462
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:53,290
I have enough.

3463
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:55,670
Alright.

3464
02:22:58,450 --> 02:22:59,190
Oh, wait.

3465
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:00,350
There's a question mark here.

3466
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:02,770
Oh, I did...

3467
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:03,090
Okay.

3468
02:23:03,210 --> 02:23:04,450
I didn't even...

3469
02:23:05,050 --> 02:23:06,890
I didn't even have to do that.

3470
02:23:10,110 --> 02:23:10,670
Alright.

3471
02:23:12,490 --> 02:23:13,950
Make him stronger.

3472
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:17,250
I decide...

3473
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:17,790
Okay, speed.

3474
02:23:18,170 --> 02:23:18,450
I...

3475
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:19,550
Okay, wait.

3476
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:20,050
Wait.

3477
02:23:21,770 --> 02:23:22,370
Is...

3478
02:23:22,370 --> 02:23:25,010
Is he crush attack or special attack, guys?

3479
02:23:25,710 --> 02:23:26,990
We doesn't need speed.

3480
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:28,130
As long as...

3481
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:29,690
As long as he can one-shot.

3482
02:23:29,690 --> 02:23:30,890
Is like...

3483
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:36,170
Please come back.

3484
02:23:36,870 --> 02:23:38,190
Let's keep doing it.

3485
02:23:38,830 --> 02:23:40,170
Make him stronger.

3486
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:43,090
He doesn't need speed.

3487
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:46,730
Oh.

3488
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:47,650
Wait.

3489
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:49,590
Wait, he's already as strong as possible?

3490
02:23:50,650 --> 02:23:52,270
Wait, I can only do it once?

3491
02:23:55,730 --> 02:23:56,490
That's fine.

3492
02:23:56,930 --> 02:23:57,250
That's fine.

3493
02:23:57,610 --> 02:23:59,910
109... Oh, he's a big boy.

3494
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:04,050
Alright, there you go.

3495
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:06,550
You just need one... Oh, try speed?

3496
02:24:06,650 --> 02:24:07,830
Can I do one on speed?

3497
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:15,900
Alright.

3498
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:18,420
Okay, now he's just a little bit faster now.

3499
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:20,140
Alright, let's see.

3500
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:28,860
Nice.

3501
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:29,980
There we go.

3502
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:35,000
You only cap him once, it just raises IVs to 31, the max.

3503
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:35,600
Oh, okay.

3504
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:40,800
So, it's okay if I do it twice to speed and attack, right?

3505
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:42,880
Alright.

3506
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:44,880
Oh my god, he's actually a little bit faster.

3507
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,320
Okay, that's good.

3508
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:47,020
Nice.

3509
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:48,620
Alright, now he's my big boy.

3510
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:49,920
That's right.

3511
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:52,640
Excuse me, please come over here for a moment.

3512
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:55,100
Only those with all eight passers.

3513
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:57,180
Let me check how many you've attained.

3514
02:24:58,320 --> 02:24:58,920
Yay!

3515
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:00,740
Oh, this is like Victory Road.

3516
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:03,280
But it's Rainbow Road!

3517
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:05,120
Oh, that's so clever!

3518
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:08,240
Wait, it changes his nature?

3519
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:09,540
What's his nature now?

3520
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:12,760
Sassy.

3521
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:13,860
Oh, he's so sassy.

3522
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:15,340
I don't know anything about nature.

3523
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:20,420
I don't know how the nature stuff works.

3524
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:27,400
Okay.

3525
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:28,860
Wait, okay.

3526
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:30,220
Before we do...

3527
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:31,060
I heard there...

3528
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:31,460
Do we...

3529
02:25:31,460 --> 02:25:33,420
Can we access the secret now or no?

3530
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,120
I actually don't know where the secret is though.

3531
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:40,220
Is it back at home?

3532
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:43,680
Mario's pad?

3533
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:46,160
Mario's pad?

3534
02:25:46,980 --> 02:25:48,380
I know about the secret.

3535
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,180
But like, I don't know how to get the secret.

3536
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:56,660
I don't know how to do it.

3537
02:25:57,310 --> 02:25:58,260
It's like here.

3538
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:03,320
I have to beat the game!

3539
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,690
I don't think you're ready.

3540
02:26:13,350 --> 02:26:14,510
I'm sad.

3541
02:26:15,090 --> 02:26:16,390
I'm so sad.

3542
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:23,970
I have to beat the game for the secret.

3543
02:26:27,470 --> 02:26:28,790
Rainbow Road is ruthless!

3544
02:26:29,310 --> 02:26:30,790
I have faith in your cutting skills!

3545
02:26:30,970 --> 02:26:33,150
I know as you're going off the edge!

3546
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:35,070
Oh my god.

3547
02:26:35,250 --> 02:26:36,390
Oh my god.

3548
02:26:36,530 --> 02:26:37,290
Wait, I want to fight him.

3549
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:38,550
I need more...

3550
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:39,770
...stuff for a dad.

3551
02:26:48,610 --> 02:26:49,790
Oh my god, it's...

3552
02:26:50,290 --> 02:26:51,030
It's your brother.

3553
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:56,070
Okay, I don't think I can...

3554
02:26:56,070 --> 02:26:56,770
I don't know.

3555
02:26:56,910 --> 02:26:58,290
He seems pretty fucking big.

3556
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:02,990
And then...

3557
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:09,960
He is...

3558
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:11,560
He definitely looks like a cuckoo bird.

3559
02:27:15,150 --> 02:27:18,410
Like, my actual son got like, thrown off its nest.

3560
02:27:18,750 --> 02:27:19,970
And you guys just took...

3561
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:33,220
Nice, goodbye.

3562
02:27:41,870 --> 02:27:42,810
I was...

3563
02:27:42,810 --> 02:27:44,030
I was just trying to merge!

3564
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:45,770
Oh my god.

3565
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:46,330
What?

3566
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:50,490
Wait, how do you do this?

3567
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:51,690
Excuse me?

3568
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:54,230
Oh, I can't do it slow.

3569
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:55,570
Oh my god.

3570
02:27:55,810 --> 02:27:56,210
That...

3571
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:57,150
That's hell.

3572
02:27:57,630 --> 02:27:58,070
That's...

3573
02:27:58,570 --> 02:27:59,650
That's actual hell.

3574
02:28:01,510 --> 02:28:04,330
Hey, did these boost battles look like a little third party deal?

3575
02:28:04,810 --> 02:28:07,230
I know I'm supposed to drive on and I'm all fearless and stuff.

3576
02:28:07,670 --> 02:28:08,850
I can't help but be scared.

3577
02:28:09,050 --> 02:28:09,810
Oh my god.

3578
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:11,270
That reminds me.

3579
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:13,290
I heard about, um...

3580
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:14,250
You know that new Mario?

3581
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:15,570
Uh...

3582
02:28:15,570 --> 02:28:16,990
The new Mario Kart game?

3583
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:20,570
And then there's apparently a new game mode called like, mirror mode or something.

3584
02:28:20,810 --> 02:28:25,070
I saw a tweet being like, to unlock this mode, you need a master's degree or some shit.

3585
02:28:25,070 --> 02:28:28,710
Because no one, no one knows how to actually unlock mirror mode.

3586
02:28:29,010 --> 02:28:30,990
Like, some guy was like, you need to do this.

3587
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:36,430
And you need to get 10 Peach Coins, then you need to win every cup game, every trophy in first place.

3588
02:28:36,630 --> 02:28:40,910
And then like, there's like 20 different answers on how to unlock this mode.

3589
02:28:41,130 --> 02:28:44,250
And the guy was like, this proves my point.

3590
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:50,230
Yeah, there's apparently some secret...

3591
02:28:50,230 --> 02:28:54,250
There's some secret hidden mode called mirror mode in the new Mario Kart game.

3592
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:56,510
And no one knows how to unlock it, actually.

3593
02:28:58,210 --> 02:28:59,470
Just pay Nintendo.

3594
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:10,560
Oh, is it always a thing?

3595
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:11,820
Oh, I didn't know that.

3596
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:13,900
Someone was just like, how do you...

3597
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:15,400
How the fuck do you actually unlock...

3598
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:20,700
Like, apparently it's like, no one knows the real way to unlock it, though, for the current game.

3599
02:29:27,970 --> 02:29:29,630
Oh my god, I hate this.

3600
02:29:30,030 --> 02:29:31,570
How do I...

3601
02:29:32,110 --> 02:29:33,670
Are you fucking kidding me?

3602
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:36,110
Oh my god, this is hell.

3603
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:37,150
This is actually hell.

3604
02:29:37,410 --> 02:29:37,890
This...

3605
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:42,910
Oh my god.

3606
02:29:44,130 --> 02:29:44,610
But

3607
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:49,630
like...

3608
02:29:50,370 --> 02:29:51,330
I give up.

3609
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:52,210
I give up.

3610
02:29:52,390 --> 02:29:53,210
I give up.

3611
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:53,890
I...

3612
02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:54,670
I can't.

3613
02:29:54,790 --> 02:29:55,990
I cannot do the shortcut.

3614
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:57,670
I cannot do the shortcut.

3615
02:29:57,850 --> 02:29:58,410
Oh, fuck that.

3616
02:29:59,610 --> 02:30:00,750
I can't.

3617
02:30:00,970 --> 02:30:02,350
I give up.

3618
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:06,550
Underclock your CP.

3619
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:11,590
Don't give up.

3620
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:15,430
But it's so easy, though.

3621
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:23,460
Oh my god.

3622
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:25,100
I love...

3623
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:29,940
Oh, I saw like a screenshot of like, when the game first came out in the multiplayer mode.

3624
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:32,320
And then literally everybody was just a cow.

3625
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,500
I mean, good choice, though.

3626
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:38,560
I'd be the cow, too, if I paid $80.

3627
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:41,660
And also another...

3628
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:45,440
Another, what, $200 plus for the Nintendo Switch, too.

3629
02:30:51,050 --> 02:30:51,930
Cow meta.

3630
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:01,650
Oh, $450?

3631
02:31:02,270 --> 02:31:04,150
That's like, $600 Canadian!

3632
02:31:04,870 --> 02:31:05,810
Holy fuck!

3633
02:31:06,650 --> 02:31:08,770
That's more expensive than a PS5!

3634
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:11,470
You know what?

3635
02:31:11,690 --> 02:31:17,570
Okay, I think the craziest shit about Switch games, or like, Nintendo games, is that they're never on discount.

3636
02:31:17,970 --> 02:31:19,710
I think that is the craziest part.

3637
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:24,980
Wait, can I encounter this?

3638
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:25,840
There are mods on this?

3639
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:27,500
I have it off?

3640
02:31:27,740 --> 02:31:28,840
Oh no, I have it on.

3641
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:29,920
Or off.

3642
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:33,440
Alright, fight me.

3643
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:36,560
Don't be afraid to switch to the water portions!

3644
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,300
I'll be right back to your car!

3645
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:40,060
Once you're done!

3646
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:41,240
Wait, what?

3647
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:44,700
How do I get on the water portions?

3648
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:47,460
Oh!

3649
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:48,260
There we go.

3650
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:51,500
No, I never...

3651
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,200
I never get consoles on launch.

3652
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:55,560
I never do that.

3653
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:58,440
I wait until...

3654
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:02,060
I wait until, like, they fix some stuff before I do.

3655
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:05,200
Because every console on launch, there's always a problem.

3656
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:09,900
It's never worth it.

3657
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:10,380
Hey!

3658
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:12,000
Careful where you're driving that thing!

3659
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:17,780
Oh shit.

3660
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:19,740
Alright, time to throw him.

3661
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:22,320
Oh shit, never mind.

3662
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,040
Goodbye, Dad.

3663
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:25,740
Of course they have Drift!

3664
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:26,860
You think they're gonna fix it?

3665
02:32:26,860 --> 02:32:29,100
You're just gonna buy a new Joy-Con any...

3666
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:29,780
Hahahaha!

3667
02:32:32,660 --> 02:32:33,140
You...

3668
02:32:33,140 --> 02:32:34,960
You're just gonna buy a new Joy-Con anyway!

3669
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:38,080
It's been like, 10 plus years!

3670
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:42,160
If no one has done anything, you think they'll still do something?

3671
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:43,280
Hahahaha!

3672
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:53,220
Acupuncture.

3673
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:54,960
Or acupressure.

3674
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:57,940
I'll just fucking...

3675
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:59,060
Just punch the fish.

3676
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:02,860
Oh my god.

3677
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,580
I literally used the wrong character for this.

3678
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:13,900
And this new set of controllers don't have a class action lawsuit.

3679
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:17,060
So, they won't fix them for free either.

3680
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:18,700
I think that's the crazy part.

3681
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:20,720
I read, like, what they said...

3682
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:21,440
What was it?

3683
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:22,820
Um...

3684
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:24,100
That they, like...

3685
02:33:24,100 --> 02:33:26,560
They're willing to replace Joy-Cons that have drift.

3686
02:33:26,900 --> 02:33:27,520
But, like...

3687
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:28,000
This...

3688
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,220
They didn't learn from it.

3689
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:32,720
And, like, the Switch 2 Joy-Cons have the same issue as the...

3690
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:34,120
The first Joy-Con.

3691
02:33:39,250 --> 02:33:41,330
I think that's the wildest part.

3692
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:42,630
Oh, why did I send out ground?

3693
02:33:42,830 --> 02:33:43,050
Alright.

3694
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:44,630
That's fine.

3695
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:47,410
I was like, wait a minute.

3696
02:33:47,570 --> 02:33:49,230
Why did I send out ground?

3697
02:33:49,230 --> 02:33:49,630
Oh.

3698
02:33:50,190 --> 02:33:50,670
It's okay.

3699
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:51,510
He didn't use water.

3700
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:00,040
That's awkward.

3701
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:04,020
What?

3702
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:05,840
How did you miss?

3703
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:09,120
Oh no.

3704
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:13,920
Oh no.

3705
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:15,380
Alright.

3706
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:17,240
If he has to die...

3707
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:19,120
Then you must join your brother.

3708
02:34:20,900 --> 02:34:22,300
You're so linked.

3709
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:25,420
What?

3710
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:25,840
It's okay.

3711
02:34:26,660 --> 02:34:28,240
It doesn't hurt that much.

3712
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,740
We can show him how it's done.

3713
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:38,300
You know what?

3714
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:40,000
You know what?

3715
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:40,820
Dot, dot, dot.

3716
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:41,740
Dragoon?

3717
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:44,560
Maybe you're not so bad.

3718
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:49,680
Mother, look!

3719
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:50,740
Look, mother!

3720
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:52,360
I did it!

3721
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:54,480
Are you proud of me, mother?

3722
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:04,130
Ray, thank you for the super chat.

3723
02:35:04,210 --> 02:35:04,390
Thank you.

3724
02:35:04,570 --> 02:35:05,110
Thank you.

3725
02:35:06,190 --> 02:35:06,690
Oh, shit.

3726
02:35:08,750 --> 02:35:09,310
Mother!

3727
02:35:09,750 --> 02:35:10,430
Love us!

3728
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:18,650
Oh, fuck.

3729
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:25,320
How much more can it go up?

3730
02:35:26,940 --> 02:35:27,500
Oh.

3731
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:31,000
That's awkward.

3732
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:33,400
Oh, it doesn't even affect them.

3733
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:33,900
Oh.

3734
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,420
It'll be fine, right?

3735
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:38,620
Oh.

3736
02:35:41,180 --> 02:35:41,580
Whoa.

3737
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,620
That's awkward.

3738
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,100
Oh, and humor.

3739
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:47,800
Oh, another...

3740
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:49,080
Oh, another sword stance.

3741
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:50,280
Oh, my God.

3742
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,280
Goodbye.

3743
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:56,240
It's okay.

3744
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:56,400
It's okay.

3745
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:56,960
We have half three.

3746
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:58,400
That...

3747
02:35:58,400 --> 02:35:59,540
That was awkward, guys.

3748
02:36:06,570 --> 02:36:07,490
Oh, man.

3749
02:36:07,710 --> 02:36:07,970
Okay.

3750
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:08,930
I really...

3751
02:36:08,930 --> 02:36:09,990
Oh, and another stamina.

3752
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:10,810
Okay.

3753
02:36:11,890 --> 02:36:12,490
Oh.

3754
02:36:15,570 --> 02:36:16,830
It'll be fine, right?

3755
02:36:17,130 --> 02:36:18,330
It'll be fine.

3756
02:36:18,810 --> 02:36:20,730
Everything will be fine.

3757
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:25,010
Oh.

3758
02:36:25,310 --> 02:36:26,030
Oh.

3759
02:36:26,570 --> 02:36:26,890
Oh.

3760
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:27,810
Another stamina.

3761
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:30,690
Oh, shit.

3762
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:32,350
Oh, shit.

3763
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:33,190
Guys, it's fine.

3764
02:36:33,490 --> 02:36:35,150
I have a secret weapon.

3765
02:36:38,570 --> 02:36:41,650
Stop making him stronger.

3766
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:42,810
Um.

3767
02:36:43,890 --> 02:36:45,010
How are you poisoned?

3768
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:45,950
You're floating!

3769
02:36:51,950 --> 02:36:52,990
Okay.

3770
02:36:54,350 --> 02:36:54,810
There you go.

3771
02:36:55,510 --> 02:36:55,810
There you go.

3772
02:36:55,890 --> 02:36:57,150
This is my secret weapon.

3773
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:04,350
Oh.

3774
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:06,030
Whoa.

3775
02:37:06,570 --> 02:37:07,490
Oh, shit.

3776
02:37:07,490 --> 02:37:08,370
Uh.

3777
02:37:08,910 --> 02:37:10,570
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3778
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:14,150
No.

3779
02:37:14,430 --> 02:37:14,870
No, guys.

3780
02:37:15,070 --> 02:37:16,090
I have an idea.

3781
02:37:17,450 --> 02:37:18,090
Okay.

3782
02:37:18,310 --> 02:37:18,850
He's poisoned.

3783
02:37:20,190 --> 02:37:20,790
Okay.

3784
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:21,650
Guys.

3785
02:37:22,190 --> 02:37:23,050
I have...

3786
02:37:23,050 --> 02:37:24,290
I have an idea.

3787
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:29,550
All your friends are dead, Dad.

3788
02:37:30,210 --> 02:37:31,490
But it's okay.

3789
02:37:31,490 --> 02:37:32,830
You're still alive.

3790
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:38,240
You'll stop.

3791
02:37:38,500 --> 02:37:40,600
We're not using explosions!

3792
02:37:41,160 --> 02:37:42,580
We can't get him!

3793
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:44,460
This is like our last chance!

3794
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:50,080
Okay, we have Storm Throat.

3795
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:53,160
Oh, my God.

3796
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:54,260
We did it!

3797
02:37:54,540 --> 02:37:57,300
All your friends are dead, but you're alive.

3798
02:37:57,660 --> 02:38:00,100
Here to take up all the XP.

3799
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:00,940
Here.

3800
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:02,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

3801
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:06,360
All right.

3802
02:38:07,240 --> 02:38:11,260
Okay, let's make sure he doesn't die of poison.

3803
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:12,660
Real quick.

3804
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:19,620
All your friends are dead, but it's okay.

3805
02:38:20,460 --> 02:38:23,080
As long as you're alive, it's okay.

3806
02:38:23,460 --> 02:38:24,260
Oh, it's the luma!

3807
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:29,480
Holy shit, that clubba was jacked up.

3808
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:37,240
Okay.

3809
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:39,640
I wonder if there's any captures here that I don't have, though.

3810
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:42,760
Oh, is that another ref?

3811
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:44,960
That's gonna beat me up?

3812
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:49,200
No, it's fine.

3813
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:51,120
That's gonna take me to the end, right?

3814
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:55,240
Us Lacticus are on the safety team for Rainbow Road.

3815
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:57,300
They pick you up if you happen to fall off the track.

3816
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:00,660
The few of us are bored, and they want a piece of the action for themselves.

3817
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:04,580
I believe in him.

3818
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:07,860
He's got this.

3819
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:12,560
Oh, is this new?

3820
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:16,020
Oh, yeah, it is new.

3821
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:17,420
Look out!

3822
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:24,120
Oh my god, he has five... Okay.

3823
02:39:24,820 --> 02:39:26,100
Okay, this is victory.

3824
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:30,860
Dad's got this, I believe!

3825
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:33,560
He can solo them all!

3826
02:39:37,470 --> 02:39:39,950
Oh, it's like all the Yoshis!

3827
02:39:40,330 --> 02:39:41,050
Dad sweep!

3828
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,650
Let's go!

3829
02:39:45,820 --> 02:39:46,640
Oh, shit.

3830
02:39:46,900 --> 02:39:47,520
Oh, shit.

3831
02:39:47,940 --> 02:39:49,500
Don't worry, he can live through this.

3832
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:52,900
Guys, I might have...

3833
02:39:52,900 --> 02:39:53,560
Oh, god.

3834
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:54,300
Okay, guys.

3835
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:55,760
Maybe I should have...

3836
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,420
Maybe...

3837
02:39:56,420 --> 02:39:58,600
Guys, maybe I should have...

3838
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:01,800
Upped my defense as well.

3839
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:03,820
Uh...

3840
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:09,180
Oh, fuck.

3841
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:10,140
Okay, that's fine.

3842
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:11,900
Dragon doesn't do much, right?

3843
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:13,040
Oh, okay.

3844
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:17,960
All right, maybe like...

3845
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:18,580
You know...

3846
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:19,980
Aww...

3847
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,460
Maybe I should have...

3848
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,360
Ooh, uh...

3849
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:25,520
Maybe, uh...

3850
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:27,680
Maybe I should have actually, uh...

3851
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:29,060
Invested in, uh...

3852
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:29,660
Oh, my god.

3853
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:30,740
And you're paralyzed!

3854
02:40:34,460 --> 02:40:36,140
It's okay, he still got it.

3855
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,200
He's still a survivor!

3856
02:40:39,860 --> 02:40:41,380
Okay, that's a normal Yoshi.

3857
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:42,540
He just can't do shit.

3858
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,580
Oh, thank god.

3859
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:52,680
Oh, thank god.

3860
02:40:52,820 --> 02:40:53,760
Oh, thank god.

3861
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:55,080
Normal Yoshi can't do shit.

3862
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:02,510
I don't know if I should risk it.

3863
02:41:02,510 --> 02:41:03,630
I don't...

3864
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:08,650
He's paralyzed.

3865
02:41:12,390 --> 02:41:13,690
Okay, okay.

3866
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:14,430
All right.

3867
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:16,330
Normally...

3868
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:18,570
Normally, I'd be like, let's go gambling!

3869
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:20,270
But like, I...

3870
02:41:20,970 --> 02:41:21,890
I don't know.

3871
02:41:24,490 --> 02:41:26,790
Might be not the right time.

3872
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:30,550
It might not be the right time to go gambling anymore.

3873
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:38,870
I feel like he might actually kill him.

3874
02:41:40,430 --> 02:41:41,090
Oh, yeah.

3875
02:41:41,230 --> 02:41:41,690
No, that...

3876
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:43,770
Yeah, that...

3877
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:44,570
Yeah, he would...

3878
02:41:44,570 --> 02:41:45,930
Yeah, he would have been fucking dead.

3879
02:41:46,090 --> 02:41:46,590
Yeah, yeah.

3880
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:47,390
No, he...

3881
02:41:47,390 --> 02:41:47,590
Yeah.

3882
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:50,870
Yeah.

3883
02:41:51,230 --> 02:41:52,910
Yeah, he would definitely not survive that.

3884
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:58,360
Oh, thank god.

3885
02:41:58,600 --> 02:41:58,780
Yay!

3886
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:00,060
You live!

3887
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:02,000
You live!

3888
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:04,140
The waterfall blinded me!

3889
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:06,520
All right, we're good to go.

3890
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:09,940
Okay.

3891
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:12,500
Hey, Mario!

3892
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:15,540
I finally caught up with you, bro.

3893
02:42:16,100 --> 02:42:17,640
I've been meaning to ask this since...

3894
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:19,940
Ever since we defeated Bowser together.

3895
02:42:20,380 --> 02:42:22,780
But, do you think we can have one final battle?

3896
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:27,860
I want to give you all I got with the friends I made along the way.

3897
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:28,740
Wait.

3898
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:29,500
Wait.

3899
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,100
Can you heal me?

3900
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:30,720
Wait.

3901
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:31,860
Luigi, can you...

3902
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:32,120
Wait.

3903
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:32,760
Luigi.

3904
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:34,280
Luigi, wait!

3905
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:35,260
Wait!

3906
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:35,740
Wait!

3907
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:37,680
I don't...

3908
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:42,540
Usually, you'd heal him!

3909
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:46,360
Luigi, why didn't you heal me?

3910
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:51,940
You got...

3911
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:53,920
Mario, that's a cool team?

3912
02:42:54,280 --> 02:42:55,020
What do you mean?

3913
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:57,600
All I have is dad right now.

3914
02:42:57,900 --> 02:42:59,200
What do you mean team?

3915
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,700
Oh, fuck!

3916
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:01,220
Okay.

3917
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:03,900
Okay, it's not...

3918
02:43:03,900 --> 02:43:05,700
It's nothing personal, kid.

3919
02:43:06,400 --> 02:43:06,980
Okay, that's fine.

3920
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:07,900
It's fine.

3921
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:10,440
I still have a lot of golden shroomies learned.

3922
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:13,380
He's gonna be a player one soon.

3923
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:17,100
Hit him while he's weak.

3924
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:20,760
Oh, my God.

3925
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,420
What the fuck?

3926
02:43:21,660 --> 02:43:23,060
What the fuck, Luigi?

3927
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:30,020
Okay, this is all I have.

3928
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:33,140
He knows what he's doing.

3929
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,160
Oh, thank God.

3930
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:40,860
When his bro needed the most, Luigi with the steel chair.

3931
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:42,780
Oh, my God.

3932
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:44,620
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

3933
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,000
Thank you.

3934
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:45,700
Thank you.

3935
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,560
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3936
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:47,840
Thank you.

3937
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:48,280
Thank you.

3938
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:54,900
Luigi learned from the best karaoke ambushing you out of the Zubac Cave exit level stats.

3939
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:58,140
Or strats.

3940
02:43:58,980 --> 02:43:59,080
Okay.

3941
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,060
That's still alive.

3942
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:01,980
Somehow.

3943
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:04,220
He's still...

3944
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:06,660
Topedo, use explosion.

3945
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:10,400
I would if I could, guys.

3946
02:44:13,380 --> 02:44:15,320
If he didn't fucking...

3947
02:44:15,320 --> 02:44:18,260
If he didn't fucking...

3948
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:22,000
Maybe have only one mod right now.

3949
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:27,920
Can't believe that is a really competitive scene for this game.

3950
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:29,740
Who am I thinking for the super chat?

3951
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:30,100
Thank you.

3952
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:30,500
Thank you.

3953
02:44:30,660 --> 02:44:31,380
Oh, my God.

3954
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:32,700
Oh, my God.

3955
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:33,920
Thank God I didn't.

3956
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:35,740
I told my God.

3957
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:40,100
Imagine if I, like, if he just dies from that.

3958
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:42,980
Imagine if he just dies from the fucking recoil.

3959
02:44:42,980 --> 02:44:45,080
Okay, I still have five more.

3960
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:46,440
I can heal now.

3961
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:51,220
Okay.

3962
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:53,420
Oh, shit.

3963
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:54,000
Okay.

3964
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:56,720
This is so awkward.

3965
02:45:00,180 --> 02:45:01,760
You can take this.

3966
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:02,360
I...

3967
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:03,700
Oh, fuck.

3968
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:05,420
Oh, shit.

3969
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:06,820
I just have explosions.

3970
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:08,300
Oh, no.

3971
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:08,740
Okay.

3972
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:10,420
This is fine.

3973
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:11,000
This is fine.

3974
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:13,140
I have a thing that gives me pee pee.

3975
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:14,840
Where's the pee pee?

3976
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:16,920
Where's the pee pee?

3977
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:19,340
Pee pee pee, where are you?

3978
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:20,620
We need...

3979
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:21,920
We need it.

3980
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:24,880
Okay, where's the syrup?

3981
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:25,800
Okay, here you go.

3982
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:28,520
All right.

3983
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:32,240
As long as he doesn't do...

3984
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:34,100
Doesn't...

3985
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:35,560
Oh, he does earthquake again.

3986
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:37,940
Wait, he does earthquake again.

3987
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:41,080
As long as it's not a critical hit, we should be fine.

3988
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:42,840
Jesus Christ.

3989
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:47,900
I am like...

3990
02:45:47,900 --> 02:45:50,620
We're not losing to Luigi, guys.

3991
02:45:51,380 --> 02:45:54,840
He might have caught me when I'm at my weakest.

3992
02:46:00,730 --> 02:46:01,610
It's okay.

3993
02:46:02,470 --> 02:46:03,430
He shall have...

3994
02:46:03,430 --> 02:46:04,270
Oh, my God.

3995
02:46:04,610 --> 02:46:05,250
How much...

3996
02:46:05,250 --> 02:46:07,190
How much earthquake are you gonna use?

3997
02:46:10,230 --> 02:46:11,570
Okay, we're still okay.

3998
02:46:11,710 --> 02:46:12,390
We're still okay.

3999
02:46:12,810 --> 02:46:14,070
We're still okay.

4000
02:46:14,850 --> 02:46:15,970
Throw that fucker.

4001
02:46:16,090 --> 02:46:16,810
Throw him.

4002
02:46:18,230 --> 02:46:19,010
That's right.

4003
02:46:19,230 --> 02:46:20,230
Throw him off a cliff.

4004
02:46:23,330 --> 02:46:24,450
At least...

4005
02:46:24,450 --> 02:46:24,590
Okay.

4006
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:28,030
I'm risking it.

4007
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:29,090
I move first.

4008
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:30,990
That's fucking right.

4009
02:46:31,090 --> 02:46:31,810
Get out of here.

4010
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:35,770
Okay.

4011
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:39,760
Fuck.

4012
02:46:39,960 --> 02:46:40,200
Okay.

4013
02:46:40,920 --> 02:46:43,180
Maybe I was distracted by this rainbow.

4014
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,340
Okay.

4015
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:45,400
I don't trust...

4016
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:46,520
I'm sorry, Dad.

4017
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:47,280
I...

4018
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:49,060
I don't trust you.

4019
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:51,200
We have another golden shroom.

4020
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:51,980
Eat.

4021
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:53,540
Eat, Dad.

4022
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:54,180
Eat.

4023
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:58,400
The heavier you are, the more damage you do.

4024
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,160
Oh, my God.

4025
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:02,120
Of course, he uses brain burn.

4026
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:13,640
I don't know if he should eat.

4027
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:14,440
I don't know.

4028
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:16,480
I think he's faster.

4029
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:17,840
I...

4030
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:19,960
I think he's faster.

4031
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:21,420
No, I don't trust it.

4032
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:23,420
I think he's faster.

4033
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:24,460
I...

4034
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:26,520
I legitly think he's faster.

4035
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:29,680
Okay.

4036
02:47:30,460 --> 02:47:31,200
Eat.

4037
02:47:31,660 --> 02:47:33,200
Keep eating, Dad.

4038
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:41,400
Oh, my God.

4039
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:42,780
Oh, my God.

4040
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:45,020
Oh, my God.

4041
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:45,860
Oh, my God.

4042
02:47:45,860 --> 02:47:46,040
Oh, my God.

4043
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:46,760
Oh, my God.

4044
02:47:46,760 --> 02:47:47,220
Last one.

4045
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,180
Keep eating.

4046
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:52,980
We can outlive this.

4047
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:55,040
We can outlive it.

4048
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:58,200
Yes.

4049
02:47:58,580 --> 02:47:59,720
We did it.

4050
02:48:01,020 --> 02:48:02,800
Eat the mushroom.

4051
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:10,480
Oh, that was so close.

4052
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:13,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4053
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:14,420
Oh, shit.

4054
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:15,860
Oh, we did it.

4055
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:16,840
Oh, my God.

4056
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:21,860
We actually lived from a movie.

4057
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:25,040
That was close.

4058
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,440
Wow, Robro.

4059
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:31,260
Bro, you really mastered this game, haven't you?

4060
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:34,580
Yes, with the power of eating right now.

4061
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:36,680
Don't worry, though.

4062
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:38,540
I'll catch up in no time.

4063
02:48:38,780 --> 02:48:39,640
Just you see.

4064
02:48:40,040 --> 02:48:42,660
By the way, are you prepared for the rest of the room?

4065
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:45,720
Here, let me heal you up before I leave.

4066
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:47,440
You fucking whore.

4067
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:51,540
Well, I'mma go on ahead.

4068
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:52,660
Good luck, bro.

4069
02:48:53,740 --> 02:48:54,760
Thanks, bro.

4070
02:48:55,660 --> 02:48:56,220
Thanks.

4071
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:57,960
Thanks for the heal, bro.

4072
02:48:58,610 --> 02:49:01,100
I really appreciate it.

4073
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:08,840
If you made it this far, you're probably sitting on tunnels of coin you could have used to stock up on supplies.

4074
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:12,320
Thank you, Luigi.

4075
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:16,160
Why didn't you do that before?

4076
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:20,240
Look at Tokyo's plot, wherever.

4077
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:22,900
Thank you in the super chat.

4078
02:49:23,140 --> 02:49:24,060
Thank you.

4079
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:28,060
Oh my god, he lived.

4080
02:49:28,620 --> 02:49:30,760
He actually lived.

4081
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:40,040
Oh my god, when I saw his HP go down and down and down, I was like, No way.

4082
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:42,720
Wait, that wasn't half HP.

4083
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:52,650
Oh my god, now he, thank fucking god.

4084
02:49:55,850 --> 02:49:57,810
It wasn't stopping.

4085
02:49:58,270 --> 02:50:02,310
I got really, really worried when it didn't stop.

4086
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:08,740
Alright, nice.

4087
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:12,280
Oh, no.

4088
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:13,220
No, we're fine.

4089
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:20,800
Oh my god.

4090
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:23,020
Oh no, the psychic move.

4091
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:25,940
That is weak to thinking.

4092
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:27,420
No.

4093
02:50:28,660 --> 02:50:30,560
Fucking a weak ass bitch.

4094
02:50:30,860 --> 02:50:31,800
Why you flinch?

4095
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:36,140
Alright, nice.

4096
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:37,080
That's fine.

4097
02:50:38,480 --> 02:50:39,220
Flinch me once.

4098
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:40,260
Full on me.

4099
02:50:40,400 --> 02:50:41,280
Flinch me twice.

4100
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:43,380
Shame on you.

4101
02:50:45,800 --> 02:50:47,900
Oh man, my bullet bear!

4102
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:51,700
Is there anything in here?

4103
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:53,560
What's this?

4104
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:54,900
Warning.

4105
02:50:55,280 --> 02:50:55,760
Dangerous.

4106
02:50:55,940 --> 02:50:57,040
Find different path.

4107
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:57,940
Okay, I can do this.

4108
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:01,560
Wait, I can do this.

4109
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,300
Wait, I can do this.

4110
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:07,860
What?

4111
02:51:08,180 --> 02:51:08,900
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4112
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:16,000
Last try.

4113
02:51:19,360 --> 02:51:19,760
No!

4114
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:20,900
It was so close!

4115
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:22,280
Oh my god.

4116
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:23,160
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4117
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:26,760
No!

4118
02:51:30,730 --> 02:51:31,830
Wait, I actually got it.

4119
02:51:31,910 --> 02:51:32,490
I actually got it.

4120
02:51:38,440 --> 02:51:38,840
Nice!

4121
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:40,740
Oh my god, I did it.

4122
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:46,720
Okay, guys, I- I- I- I- I- we don't need to fight.

4123
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:48,120
I- I do not want to go back.

4124
02:51:48,580 --> 02:51:49,860
I- we don't need to fight.

4125
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,380
We don't need to fight anybody.

4126
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:57,620
I'll just say that.

4127
02:52:01,420 --> 02:52:02,140
Wait, what?

4128
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:03,740
Where the fuck do I go?

4129
02:52:07,060 --> 02:52:07,880
Wait, what?

4130
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:12,580
Oh, up!

4131
02:52:12,900 --> 02:52:13,660
Oh my god, it's up.

4132
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:14,440
I couldn't see.

4133
02:52:15,900 --> 02:52:17,520
Guys, I don't have any more group.

4134
02:52:17,720 --> 02:52:19,820
I don't have any more gold shrooms.

4135
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:22,860
I can't, guys.

4136
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,500
There's no- I don't have gold shrooms anymore, guys.

4137
02:52:25,940 --> 02:52:29,760
I- I- I- I fed him so much.

4138
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:33,340
I fed- he ate so much.

4139
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:36,940
I- heh- he- heh- heh- heh- heh- heh.

4140
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:39,620
He- he can't eat no more.

4141
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:48,740
Nooo!

4142
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:52,380
Oh, that's bad.

4143
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:54,200
Oh, that's pretty bad.

4144
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:56,440
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

4145
02:52:56,980 --> 02:53:09,660
It could lead hardра-

4146
02:53:16,220 --> 02:53:17,160
All right.

4147
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:21,720
Klepto?

4148
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:22,700
What's that?

4149
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:24,600
Oh, it's a bird.

4150
02:53:24,900 --> 02:53:26,020
Bird versus bird.

4151
02:53:26,740 --> 02:53:28,260
But I have rock.

4152
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:30,320
I have homewrecker.

4153
02:53:31,180 --> 02:53:32,580
Okay, that does nothing.

4154
02:53:33,960 --> 02:53:36,040
He has a super power?

4155
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:42,560
That's fine.

4156
02:53:43,980 --> 02:53:44,840
Bro, what the fuck?

4157
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:47,000
I just throw rocks.

4158
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:48,020
This guy is Superman.

4159
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:54,980
Alright, let's just use meter mash.

4160
02:53:58,920 --> 02:53:59,840
Oh, thank god.

4161
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:01,120
Okay, that actually does more damage.

4162
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:03,140
Okay.

4163
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:05,680
What else is he sending?

4164
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:08,600
Oh, I can just use grass.

4165
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:10,220
I mean, not grass.

4166
02:54:10,360 --> 02:54:12,020
I can just use air slash.

4167
02:54:14,380 --> 02:54:15,480
Get out of here.

4168
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:17,340
That's right.

4169
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:18,620
Leave!

4170
02:54:18,620 --> 02:54:18,700
Breathe!

4171
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:20,040
Yeah!

4172
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:27,160
Okay.

4173
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:29,340
Don't worry, Dad.

4174
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:32,120
I still have more food for you.

4175
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:33,680
Keep eating.

4176
02:54:34,100 --> 02:54:35,540
Keep eating, Dad.

4177
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:38,140
It's not over yet.

4178
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:39,660
I hear no bell.

4179
02:54:47,310 --> 02:54:47,870
Okay.

4180
02:54:51,710 --> 02:54:52,770
Oh, I...

4181
02:54:52,770 --> 02:54:53,650
Oh, we were here.

4182
02:54:53,870 --> 02:54:53,950
Oh.

4183
02:54:54,150 --> 02:54:54,850
Oh, okay.

4184
02:54:55,610 --> 02:54:56,170
I...

4185
02:54:59,550 --> 02:55:01,590
Someone made it through Rainbow Road.

4186
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:04,530
My car is definitely gonna need repairs after this.

4187
02:55:04,670 --> 02:55:05,730
Okay, I...

4188
02:55:05,730 --> 02:55:06,890
Oh my god.

4189
02:55:07,010 --> 02:55:07,650
I keep...

4190
02:55:07,650 --> 02:55:08,470
Actually, me here.

4191
02:55:11,110 --> 02:55:11,670
Okay.

4192
02:55:12,310 --> 02:55:12,870
No.

4193
02:55:14,290 --> 02:55:16,290
I keep forgetting which one was the heal one.

4194
02:55:17,170 --> 02:55:17,410
Alright.

4195
02:55:17,590 --> 02:55:17,950
You know what?

4196
02:55:18,130 --> 02:55:19,050
It was just a little...

4197
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:19,990
I just had too many.

4198
02:55:20,190 --> 02:55:20,370
You know?

4199
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:21,430
I had too many.

4200
02:55:21,490 --> 02:55:22,010
I just got...

4201
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:23,250
I had to spend it somewhere.

4202
02:55:27,210 --> 02:55:27,830
Oh, yeah.

4203
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:30,690
Let's make this a photo finish.

4204
02:55:31,010 --> 02:55:31,170
Okay.

4205
02:55:31,230 --> 02:55:31,510
Let's...

4206
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:33,790
Let's beat up the cameraman real quick, fast.

4207
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:39,020
Yeah.

4208
02:55:39,020 --> 02:55:40,400
This would be the Pokemon League.

4209
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:43,420
Alright.

4210
02:55:44,480 --> 02:55:48,980
After we beat up the cameraman and buy some healing items, we'll call it here.

4211
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:50,760
Since...

4212
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:52,800
We're almost done...

4213
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:53,640
Finishing...

4214
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:54,900
We're almost finished the game anyway.

4215
02:55:55,240 --> 02:55:57,500
But I did say we're finishing it at...

4216
02:55:58,420 --> 02:55:59,020
Uh...

4217
02:55:59,020 --> 02:55:59,380
Oh wait.

4218
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:00,280
He sent himself over.

4219
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:02,300
We're finishing it on Wednesday.

4220
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:06,240
I could finish the game today.

4221
02:56:06,580 --> 02:56:07,360
I could.

4222
02:56:08,640 --> 02:56:11,160
But then I could have the rest of my day to sleep.

4223
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:17,560
I could...

4224
02:56:17,560 --> 02:56:18,920
What the fuck?

4225
02:56:24,180 --> 02:56:25,480
I believe in you.

4226
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:28,500
I believe in you, son.

4227
02:56:33,710 --> 02:56:34,250
Okay.

4228
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:40,380
And then he digs a hole.

4229
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:49,410
Alright.

4230
02:56:49,410 --> 02:56:50,110
Get out.

4231
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:52,670
That's fine.

4232
02:56:52,810 --> 02:56:53,730
I wanted him out anyway.

4233
02:56:57,920 --> 02:56:58,280
Alright.

4234
02:56:58,340 --> 02:56:58,980
Use the egg bomb.

4235
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:02,960
Yay!

4236
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:05,040
Alright.

4237
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:06,020
Egg bomb him again.

4238
02:57:09,620 --> 02:57:10,020
Alright.

4239
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:13,660
Who is he gonna send?

4240
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:14,820
Oh, he's gonna send himself out.

4241
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:15,120
Wait.

4242
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:15,320
What?

4243
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:17,320
What's good against...

4244
02:57:17,800 --> 02:57:18,920
What's good against that?

4245
02:57:18,920 --> 02:57:19,780
I don't know.

4246
02:57:20,740 --> 02:57:21,080
Uh...

4247
02:57:21,080 --> 02:57:21,240
Donate.

4248
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:22,320
Thank you for the super chat.

4249
02:57:22,420 --> 02:57:22,680
Thank you.

4250
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:23,320
Thank you.

4251
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:28,000
What's good against...

4252
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:30,340
What's good against Latiku?

4253
02:57:34,060 --> 02:57:35,380
Fire or rock?

4254
02:57:42,890 --> 02:57:44,090
I'm risking it.

4255
02:57:44,850 --> 02:57:46,170
I'm risking it.

4256
02:57:46,770 --> 02:57:48,370
You got this dead!

4257
02:57:50,670 --> 02:57:51,970
You're clearly...

4258
02:57:51,970 --> 02:57:53,010
Oh, I don't think you're faster.

4259
02:57:53,230 --> 02:57:55,250
But like...

4260
02:57:55,250 --> 02:57:56,430
Oh.

4261
02:57:59,490 --> 02:58:00,170
Oh.

4262
02:58:02,170 --> 02:58:02,850
Oh.

4263
02:58:03,630 --> 02:58:04,310
Um...

4264
02:58:04,310 --> 02:58:06,190
You got this, son.

4265
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:17,600
Look at you go.

4266
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:19,600
Look at you go.

4267
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:19,720
Look at you go.

4268
02:58:20,500 --> 02:58:25,400
Look at you go.

4269
02:58:28,510 --> 02:58:29,550
Oh my god.

4270
02:58:29,670 --> 02:58:30,950
The fucking dig abuse.

4271
02:58:31,130 --> 02:58:31,890
I hate that shit.

4272
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:37,800
Okay.

4273
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:38,480
That's okay.

4274
02:58:39,320 --> 02:58:41,520
It does the damage we need.

4275
02:58:48,440 --> 02:58:48,960
Um...

4276
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:49,580
Okay.

4277
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:50,500
We got photo finish.

4278
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:53,020
Alright.

4279
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:54,260
We got the raid boss down.

4280
02:58:54,580 --> 02:58:55,980
Now I can send in my actual...

4281
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:57,120
Wait.

4282
02:58:57,380 --> 02:58:58,840
Now we can send in data again.

4283
02:59:05,260 --> 02:59:10,300
Ba dum ba dum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

4284
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:11,180
Yes!

4285
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:12,380
Sit on that bean!

4286
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:14,780
I'll never get tired of that.

4287
02:59:26,180 --> 02:59:26,860
Alright.

4288
02:59:27,160 --> 02:59:27,820
Last one.

4289
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:29,500
Oh shit.

4290
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:31,700
Oh.

4291
02:59:31,700 --> 02:59:32,340
Oh.

4292
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:32,700
Oh.

4293
02:59:32,700 --> 02:59:33,060
Oh my god.

4294
02:59:33,180 --> 02:59:33,320
Dad.

4295
02:59:33,740 --> 02:59:34,400
Oh my god.

4296
02:59:35,960 --> 02:59:37,000
Every time.

4297
02:59:37,420 --> 02:59:40,100
Every time he lives with one HP.

4298
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:41,600
Every time.

4299
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:46,000
Yay!

4300
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:49,240
Clutch, he takes those.

4301
02:59:49,720 --> 02:59:51,380
That was a fantastic battle.

4302
02:59:51,780 --> 02:59:53,340
Maybe I should have recorded it.

4303
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:54,680
Perfect.

4304
02:59:55,060 --> 02:59:55,980
Now how about...

4305
02:59:55,980 --> 02:59:56,380
Super hide?

4306
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:57,120
Super Mario?

4307
02:59:57,320 --> 02:59:58,420
Super jump for the camera!

4308
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:00,680
Alright.

4309
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:02,980
I think it really captured your essence.

4310
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:03,400
Get it?

4311
03:00:03,800 --> 03:00:05,340
CrankyCon may have rubbed off after...

4312
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:06,960
After recording his commie show.

4313
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:07,460
Well.

4314
03:00:07,720 --> 03:00:08,680
Your photo's uploading.

4315
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:12,920
Alright.

4316
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:13,460
Let's heal.

4317
03:00:15,020 --> 03:00:16,060
That was...

4318
03:00:16,060 --> 03:00:17,340
Oh my gosh.

4319
03:00:17,340 --> 03:00:20,080
I sure do love gambling with Dad's life!

4320
03:00:20,780 --> 03:00:21,380
I sure do love gambling with Dad's life!

4321
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:21,920
In game!

4322
03:00:23,020 --> 03:00:23,460
Okay.

4323
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:24,800
Let's buy some...

4324
03:00:25,330 --> 03:00:25,600
Shrooms.

4325
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:28,640
Get it from here?

4326
03:00:28,900 --> 03:00:29,120
No.

4327
03:00:29,180 --> 03:00:30,040
It's on the other side.

4328
03:00:33,100 --> 03:00:33,640
Alright.

4329
03:00:34,540 --> 03:00:35,620
Ultra Shroom.

4330
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:36,660
Max.

4331
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:36,960
Okay.

4332
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:37,920
We need more...

4333
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:39,340
We definitely need more of these.

4334
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:42,140
These guys have actually clutched it for us.

4335
03:00:42,940 --> 03:00:44,060
And then...

4336
03:00:44,060 --> 03:00:44,980
Half HP.

4337
03:00:45,260 --> 03:00:46,280
Oh, we don't get like the...

4338
03:00:47,100 --> 03:00:47,660
Oh!

4339
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:50,980
Okay.

4340
03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:53,320
Let's grab...

4341
03:00:54,140 --> 03:00:54,700
Wait.

4342
03:00:55,060 --> 03:00:56,620
Let's have something that raises 5.

4343
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:57,600
Oh, there it is.

4344
03:00:58,500 --> 03:00:59,060
Okay.

4345
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:01,340
Now he's unstoppable.

4346
03:01:06,300 --> 03:01:07,160
Where's the...

4347
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:08,080
Oh, do I already have one?

4348
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:09,420
Oh my god, I already had one.

4349
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:10,940
I already have one!

4350
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:12,540
It's 5.

4351
03:01:16,310 --> 03:01:17,970
Alright, we don't need more money.

4352
03:01:19,170 --> 03:01:20,770
Just have all...

4353
03:01:20,770 --> 03:01:21,530
Now you're...

4354
03:01:21,530 --> 03:01:22,910
Now you're actually unstoppable.

4355
03:01:24,130 --> 03:01:25,810
Some would say invincible.

4356
03:01:28,170 --> 03:01:29,010
Alright.

4357
03:01:29,870 --> 03:01:31,610
Let's head over to the...

4358
03:01:32,010 --> 03:01:33,210
Elite 4 right now.

4359
03:01:35,890 --> 03:01:37,470
Alright, and then we'll save.

4360
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:38,430
Alright!

4361
03:01:38,930 --> 03:01:40,270
We'll call it here!

4362
03:01:40,770 --> 03:01:41,790
We'll finish...

4363
03:01:41,790 --> 03:01:42,730
Super Mario!

4364
03:01:44,130 --> 03:01:45,230
On Wednesday!

4365
03:01:46,310 --> 03:01:47,430
Now I'm taking a nap!

4366
03:01:48,050 --> 03:01:48,270
Ah!

4367
03:01:48,710 --> 03:01:50,590
Oh, I need to feed Dad and then...

4368
03:01:50,590 --> 03:01:52,370
I don't need to walk him...

4369
03:01:52,930 --> 03:01:54,110
What time do I walk him?

4370
03:01:54,330 --> 03:01:54,730
10...

4371
03:01:54,730 --> 03:01:55,310
11...

4372
03:01:55,310 --> 03:01:55,510
12...

4373
03:01:55,510 --> 03:01:56,530
1... 2... 3... 4... 5...

4374
03:01:56,530 --> 03:01:57,430
Okay, yeah, I need to walk him.

4375
03:01:57,710 --> 03:01:58,510
In an hour or two.

4376
03:01:58,810 --> 03:01:59,430
Alright, guys!

4377
03:01:59,710 --> 03:02:01,070
Thank you all for coming.

4378
03:02:01,390 --> 03:02:02,850
I always love streaming for you guys.

4379
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:04,470
Um, we'll finish this game...

4380
03:02:04,470 --> 03:02:05,770
On Wednesday.

4381
03:02:06,090 --> 03:02:06,870
And then we'll finish...

4382
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:07,430
Onimusha!

4383
03:02:07,530 --> 03:02:07,910
Tomorrow!

4384
03:02:08,050 --> 03:02:08,390
Too!

4385
03:02:08,690 --> 03:02:10,290
So thank you all for coming everyone!

4386
03:02:11,170 --> 03:02:11,990
I'm gonna rest a bit.

4387
03:02:12,110 --> 03:02:12,830
I gotta rest my voice.

4388
03:02:13,090 --> 03:02:14,150
Cause I have some...

4389
03:02:14,150 --> 03:02:15,290
Stuff I need to record.

4390
03:02:15,690 --> 03:02:16,190
But...

4391
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:17,430
Thank you everybody for coming.

4392
03:02:18,010 --> 03:02:18,510
Um...

4393
03:02:18,510 --> 03:02:20,090
As always, everybody.

4394
03:02:20,350 --> 03:02:21,450
Stay hydrated.

4395
03:02:21,770 --> 03:02:22,250
Posture check.

4396
03:02:22,470 --> 03:02:23,170
Get up and move around.

4397
03:02:23,310 --> 03:02:24,210
To get that blood flowing.

4398
03:02:24,410 --> 03:02:25,070
And if you...

4399
03:02:25,070 --> 03:02:25,510
Stay up for me.

4400
03:02:25,750 --> 03:02:26,430
Head to bend.

4401
03:02:26,690 --> 03:02:27,130
Cause...

4402
03:02:27,130 --> 03:02:27,950
You deserve it!

4403
03:02:28,130 --> 03:02:29,670
Alright guys, I'm gonna rest...

4404
03:02:29,670 --> 03:02:30,530
Rest up now.

4405
03:02:30,810 --> 03:02:31,730
I'm gonna take a little break...

4406
03:02:31,730 --> 03:02:32,950
Before I go back to work mode.

4407
03:02:33,150 --> 03:02:34,770
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

4408
03:02:35,010 --> 03:02:36,010
We're almost at the end.

4409
03:02:36,130 --> 03:02:36,930
I've realized like...

4410
03:02:36,930 --> 03:02:37,910
The last couple of months...

4411
03:02:37,910 --> 03:02:38,790
I've been playing some...

4412
03:02:38,790 --> 03:02:41,370
Really, really, really long game series.

4413
03:02:41,610 --> 03:02:42,810
I remember in the past...

4414
03:02:42,810 --> 03:02:43,110
Like...

4415
03:02:43,110 --> 03:02:44,570
Usually games would take me like...

4416
03:02:44,570 --> 03:02:45,430
Three to four parts.

4417
03:02:45,630 --> 03:02:46,970
But I've been playing some...

4418
03:02:46,970 --> 03:02:48,730
Super duper long games.

4419
03:02:48,950 --> 03:02:49,810
I've never had...

4420
03:02:49,810 --> 03:02:51,610
Series before that would like...

4421
03:02:51,610 --> 03:02:53,350
Take like ten plus parts to complete.

4422
03:02:53,630 --> 03:02:54,550
But it's been...

4423
03:02:54,550 --> 03:02:56,210
It's been happening a lot often now.

4424
03:02:56,530 --> 03:02:58,070
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4425
03:02:58,450 --> 03:02:59,450
Ha ha ha ha.

4426
03:02:59,870 --> 03:03:00,250
Um...

4427
03:03:00,250 --> 03:03:01,190
But it has been fun.

4428
03:03:01,310 --> 03:03:02,030
It has been fun.

4429
03:03:02,450 --> 03:03:02,890
Um...

4430
03:03:02,890 --> 03:03:04,570
Anyway guys, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4431
03:03:04,910 --> 03:03:05,570
Bye guys!

4432
03:03:05,890 --> 03:03:06,290
Bye!
