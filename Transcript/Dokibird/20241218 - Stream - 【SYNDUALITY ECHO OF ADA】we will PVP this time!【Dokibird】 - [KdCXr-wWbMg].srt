00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,680
Hello, everybody!

2
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,320
Hello, hello!

3
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,580
Surprise!

4
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,820
Today we have a sponsored stream!

5
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,540
Yeah!

6
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:57,700
So, Bandai asked me to check out the Open Network Test now for Simuality, Echo of Ada.

7
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,060
What is the Open Network Test?

8
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,440
That means any of you guys can join in!

9
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,100
So, another thing that they request... Also, it's a huge challenge.

10
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,800
Shoutout to Bandai for sponsoring for today.

11
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,820
Today might be my... Today's gonna be the last quote-unquote schedule stream before I take a little rest.

12
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,920
I don't know.

13
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,160
I think I'll be taking a little...

14
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,360
a week, a week and a half rest before I come back.

15
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,880
But I still will be doing a Christmas stream and also a... I'll still be doing a Christmas stream and a New Year's countdown stream.

16
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So, don't worry about that.

17
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,040
Right now, after today... On Saturday, I do have an Apex tournament.

18
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,200
So, after today, it's more so like streams will be a little sporadic.

19
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,920
It will be a little bit like guerrilla streams, unannounced stuff.

20
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,060
So, just giving you guys a heads up!

21
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,560
Cause I'm finally gonna take a little bit of a break.

22
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,740
It's been almost a year of me going gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.

23
00:03:50,960 --> 00:04:02,620
I'm finally gonna take... To be fair, I feel like this year, I've taken... When I came back, I have taken a lot of breaks this year compared to the last, you know, three years of streaming.

24
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,500
The last three years of streaming, my breaks were rare.

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,540
But I feel like this year, I've definitely taken more breaks than last year.

26
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,420
I think it's because I'm also doing a lot more stuff.

27
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,660
So, I definitely...

28
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,420
I feel like I'm doing a lot more stuff.

29
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,860
And like, so, I do need more breaks just to recharge myself.

30
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,700
Anyway, I fucked myself over tonight... Yesterday night, because I spent the whole night playing Marvel Rivals for seven plus hours yesterday night.

31
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,920
And I went to bed at...

32
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,680
8 AM.

33
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,360
I went to bed at 8 AM.

34
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,340
Maybe I played more than seven... No, I played more than seven hours.

35
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
It was like nine hours of Marvel Rivals.

36
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,220
And guess where... And guess where I was at?

37
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,480
With grinding my rank points, I was down a game.

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,940
I was one game, three times, in three separate occasions, I was one game away from Grandmaster.

39
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,580
I literally... I got fucked over by several people.

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,860
I won't call them out, because you can look them up.

41
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,740
So, I won't call them out, but they know who they are.

42
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,920
I got fucked over by three separate games.

43
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:33,840
Like, my actual GM rank up game, I... I won't say who they are, because they had TTVs in their name.

44
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,960
So, I can't call them out.

45
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,860
But one of them was a fucking Thor 1 trick.

46
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,700
And I was so mad, because we had this guy on our team, three games in a row.

47
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,620
And then, I was like... And at that point, I was dueling.

48
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,280
And I was like, we have to avoid them.

49
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,800
We've never won with this stupid fucking Thor 1 trick on our team.

50
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,540
And then, so we avoided them.

51
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,320
And then, we got against them.

52
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,800
And then, I was like, if we lose to this guy, we're fucking... I'm done.

53
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm done.

54
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm so fucking done.

55
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,800
And then, I told my duo, I was like, avoid... I was like, ban Thor.

56
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,940
Ban Thor, so they're absolutely useless.

57
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,940
And then, I was like, type in chat and say, ban Thor.

58
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,340
And then, my duo was like, bro, they're so bad.

59
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,000
It's alright.

60
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,820
We don't need a ban Thor.

61
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
They're so fucking bad.

62
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
We should have banned Thor.

63
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,760
We should have fucking... We should have banned Thor.

64
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,540
Like, this guy literally would not play anything else but Thor.

65
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,680
Like, the game before I had him with, half our... like, three people in our team was crying at him to fucking swap off Thor.

66
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,120
And was like, please, I'm begging you, please swap off Thor.

67
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,820
We can win this game.

68
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,680
And this guy did not care.

69
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,360
He did not fucking care.

70
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,300
And I was like, ban this guy.

71
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,500
Ban the character.

72
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,940
And my duo, of course, was like, it's alright.

73
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,080
We lost.

74
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,020
We fucking... we lost the game.

75
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,220
I was... I was so... I was so angry.

76
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,180
I... and then... and then... and then I... and then I went to bed.

77
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,640
And I was like... I was like, that was the game.

78
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,160
I decided that I need to stop.

79
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,040
Like, I lost four games in a row with this stupid fucking Thor 1 trick.

80
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,260
It was over.

81
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,680
I couldn't keep going.

82
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,420
I couldn't.

83
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,180
I couldn't.

84
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:42,320
But like, three times, I played... I was... three times, I was one win away from GM.

85
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,000
I was so mad.

86
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,740
I was like, oh my god.

87
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,240
I played, like, more than nine plus hours.

88
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,100
And three fucking times, I was one game away from GM.

89
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,860
Anyway, I don't have a problem.

90
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,640
I... I don't have a problem.

91
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,300
Anyway, today we're going to be playing Senuality Echo of Ada.

92
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,700
Thank you so much to Bandai for saving me from my crippling Marvel Rivals addiction.

93
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,380
I really appreciate it.

94
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,780
If they weren't there to save me from this problem that...

95
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,320
Not problem that I have, I might have streamed another day of Marvel Rivals.

96
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,340
So, thank you to Bandai for giving us variety in our lives.

97
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,180
This was my intervention.

98
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,560
I really appreciate it.

99
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,280
So, anyway, Marvel...

100
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,620
I'm sorry, Bandai.

102
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,640
Anyway, Bandai asked me to check out the PvP mode today.

103
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
So, remember when I was avoiding PvP this entire time?

104
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,960
The last sponsor?

105
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,420
So, this time, we're going to actually try out PvP.

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,600
So, we're going to actually kill some robots.

107
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,280
Sorry.

108
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,260
Eliminate some robots.

109
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,280
So, because last time I was trying to avoid confrontation because I was scared.

110
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,540
This time, I actually have to like...

111
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,360
I have to see if I can like...

112
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
Kill some other robots and see what...

113
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm worried because the open network test came out a couple days ago when I was in Atlanta.

114
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,280
Or like the day before I was in Atlanta.

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,460
So, I feel like a lot of the players now might have a lot of gear.

116
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,180
Might be like super stocked up.

117
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,340
So, that's the one thing I'm really worried about.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm going to try and PvP and then I get my...

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,960
I don't know.

120
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,860
I'm just going to get my robot head kicked in.

121
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,460
Blazing gun.

122
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,320
Thank you for the super chat.

123
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,620
Thank you.

124
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,300
Thank you.

125
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,300
Doki, I'm now addicted to Marvel because of you and my friends.

126
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,720
Going to play rank all day to see where I'll end up.

127
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,320
Wish me luck.

128
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,220
Thank you for the super chat.

129
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,580
Thank you.

130
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,000
Thank you.

131
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm so sorry.

132
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,760
I'm a problem.

133
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,900
It's like...

134
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,800
It's like...

135
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,640
Oh my god.

136
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,740
It's like those smoked like cigarette boxes.

137
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,420
And then they print like on the picture of like this is what happens if you smoke.

138
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,060
But you just still do it anyway.

139
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,660
Like...

140
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm so sorry.

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,860
That's...

142
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,680
That's me right now.

143
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,180
You see like there is a problem but you still go for it anyway.

144
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,940
I'm so sorry.

145
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm...

146
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,420
I'm so sorry.

147
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,560
Anyway.

148
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,460
Anyway, I'm super excited to check out Senuality.

149
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,820
I love how Bandai replied to my tweet.

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,860
My sponsored tweet.

151
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,940
And was like...

152
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,240
Let's see if she'll like...

153
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,200
Let's see if she'll continue to upgrade the bathroom.

154
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,260
I wonder if it...

155
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,860
I wonder if it like...

156
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,920
Carries over the stuff I did in the bathroom.

157
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,100
I would be so...

158
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,620
Okay.

159
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,580
I will be sad if it doesn't carry over.

160
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,320
But like...

161
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,680
It's not the end of the world.

162
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,720
But I will be sad.

163
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,140
Those...

164
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,940
Those...

165
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,860
Those four hours...

166
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,180
The four hours for the bathroom just for it to go away.

167
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,880
I will be sad.

168
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,280
Oh no.

169
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,180
It didn't!

170
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,380
We're not...

171
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,260
I can't.

172
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,940
I can't do this again, guys.

173
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,200
I can't do the bathroom again.

174
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,360
Guys, please.

175
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,180
I can't.

176
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,560
I'll do this so people will know it's not me.

177
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,700
And then like...

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,360
People will know it's not me.

179
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,100
So they won't try and kill me.

180
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,010
Oh yeah, the intro!

181
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,390
I'm cool.

182
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,370
I'm pretty cool.

183
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,510
I legitimately forgot the entire intro.

184
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,370
So let's watch it again.

185
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,950
I just realized chat's dead.

186
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,710
We'll look at the chat later.

187
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,230
Oh my god, that's crazy.

188
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,210
Oh yeah, and then we created waifus to cure our depression.

189
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,930
See, it works.

190
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,930
That's what I am.

191
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,710
Technically.

192
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,450
That's what VTubers are technically.

193
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,650
We're depressed.

194
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,730
Let's create AI waifus.

195
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,030
Why am I...

196
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,010
There's a deeper problem then.

197
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,790
That's me!

198
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,390
Again!

199
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,510
I haven't unpacked yet.

200
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,930
No, I have absolutely not unpacked.

201
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,830
That's me.

202
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,150
That's me.

203
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,710
That's the coffin!

204
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,890
Because you die in the mech suit.

205
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,030
Guys, I'll unpack when I make it to GM.

206
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,250
I hope I make it today.

207
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,430
I'm supposed to pick up dad...

208
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,250
in...

209
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,630
three hours.

210
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,690
Wait, how do I join that side?

211
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,770
That side sounds fun.

212
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,490
Wait, why do I have to be a good guy?

213
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,050
How do I join the other side?

214
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,530
They have the black market.

215
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,490
They literally have the fucking supply for energy.

216
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,750
Okay, but...

217
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,050
Toki, do you not want equal access?

218
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,630
Okay, but like, do they deserve equal access?

219
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,350
That's all I'm saying.

220
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,130
Some people might not deserve it.

221
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,630
It's not like...

222
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,330
Like, do you really need electricity?

223
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,210
And we can...

224
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,590
And we can live in a...

225
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,930
It was like, you know, millions of years ago.

226
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,110
We can live in a world where, like, without energy...

227
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,210
Like, do we really...

228
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,090
Like, before electricity was invented...

229
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,290
Like, we were okay.

230
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,650
We were doing okay.

231
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,950
So, like, you know...

232
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,410
Maybe...

233
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,670
You can stop here.

234
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,590
Where's the three displays?

235
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,410
Oh, here.

236
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,550
Alright.

237
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:26,830
Nice.

238
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,050
Oh, I forgot.

239
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,650
I forgot.

240
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,550
My waifu is so hot that she has too many polygons.

241
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,590
I keep forgetting about that.

242
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,230
LOL

243
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,770
I forgot she's so hot that she...

244
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,710
Her polygons take up so much.

245
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,350
LOL Oh my god, why are you so hot?

246
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,150
Why?

247
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,790
Okay, we'll fix this later.

248
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,610
We can't...

249
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,410
We can't change the settings until...

250
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,930
Until, like...

251
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,850
Until we're, like, out of this area.

252
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,050
Which is fine.

253
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,630
Why, virtual waifu?

254
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:22,970
Why?

255
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,910
Why are you...

256
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,710
Why do you have 8 million polygons?

257
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,590
LOL You know...

258
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,190
Actually, no, Dragoons.

259
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,090
You know why.

260
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,350
You know why she has 8 million polygons.

261
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,750
Yippee!

262
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,610
Oh, man.

263
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,890
So, what do you think?

264
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,170
Honestly.

265
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,870
So long as it's not raining...

266
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,670
Oh yeah, I forgot.

267
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,870
Rain hurts me.

268
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,790
It's time to get to work.

269
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,450
Use AO search to find crystals.

270
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,370
Oh, wait.

271
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,070
Isn't it this?

272
00:16:59,570 --> 00:16:59,970
Yeah.

273
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,010
There we go.

274
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:01,710
Where?

275
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,370
Go to the location shown at the top right of your display.

276
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,090
Oh, it's over here.

277
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:06,530
Alright.

278
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,410
I got...

279
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,850
Thank god they did this, because I legitimately forgot the controls.

280
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,890
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,570
Get down.

282
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,010
I had FPS training.

283
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,750
Oh, whoops.

284
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:26,230
LOL My anime waifu was like, There's too many.

285
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,090
Don't shoot.

286
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,150
I say as I...

287
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,250
As I shot before I heard her finish her sentence.

288
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,290
That's...

289
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:32,970
That's awkward.

290
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,090
That's...

291
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,650
LOL Don't shoot.

292
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,610
We gotta evade them.

293
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,750
I'm like, sorry, what did you say?

294
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,270
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

295
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,290
What did you want me to do before I killed...

296
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,290
Okay, recover.

297
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,170
How's the sound, by the way?

298
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,050
Whoa.

299
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,750
Whoa, the size doesn't count.

300
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,770
Whoa, it's how you use it.

301
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,530
Whoa.

302
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,430
That's messed up.

303
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,270
It's pure energy!

304
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,950
Okay.

305
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,470
It is good?

306
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,070
That's good.

307
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,910
Alright.

308
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,930
I'm excavating.

309
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,270
I did my job.

310
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,630
Are you proud of me?

311
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,010
Okay, how do I get out of here?

312
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,430
Okay, but where's the return elevator?

313
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,470
Use return points to summon an elevator and ride your way to safety.

314
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:43,850
Okay.

315
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,910
Oh, it's this way.

316
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,790
Alright, that's fine.

317
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,510
Are you lagging or just me?

318
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,310
It's sort of like...

319
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,230
She's so...

320
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,270
She's so hot that like...

321
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,750
She's so hot that I can't keep up right now.

322
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,470
I...

323
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,050
I just...

324
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,530
I can't keep up at the moment.

325
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,310
We gotta wait a little bit before it's fixed.

326
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,090
Alright.

327
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,110
Here we go.

328
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,350
Prisma, thank you for the super chat.

329
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,290
Thank you, thank you.

330
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,170
Hey, Doki.

331
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,090
Today is my birthday.

332
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,830
Float to the land of the sea, phantom thief!

333
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,750
As a birthday gift.

334
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,610
I'm happy to tell you that I've been playing...

335
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,050
Marvel Rivals most of the day.

336
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,070
Thanks to you.

337
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,990
Thank you for the super chat, Prisma.

338
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,150
Thank you, thank you.

339
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,210
Happy birthday to you.

340
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,470
Happy birthday to you.

341
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,890
Happy birthday, dear Prisma.

342
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,190
Happy birthday to you.

343
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,770
Yay!

344
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,490
And I'm so sorry.

345
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,350
I'm...

346
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,090
This is you on Marvel Rivals.

347
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,870
Thank you, Bandai, for giving me an intervention.

348
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,870
I really appreciate it.

349
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,450
Come on, why is it still raining?

350
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:08,670
Okay.

351
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,430
Oh, what?

352
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,530
It's still raining?

353
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,330
When will it stop?

354
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,870
Weather, please.

355
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,330
Why is it still raining?

356
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,710
My wife!

357
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,570
Stop the rain!

358
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,450
Change the weather right now and stop the rain, my wife.

359
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,690
Oh, we're not going home.

360
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,330
Oh, am I just supposed to go?

361
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,250
Oh.

362
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,010
But it hurts.

363
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,810
The outside.

364
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,810
It hurts so much.

365
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,490
Please, it's hurting my body.

366
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,230
Please, can you talk a little faster?

367
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,730
My body, it hurts so much.

368
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,130
Okay.

369
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,480
Oh, shit.

370
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,980
Oh my god, look at her go.

371
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,640
Yeah, that's her.

372
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,740
Yeah, that's my wife right there.

373
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,980
She did that.

374
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,500
Please,

375
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,060
stop.

376
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,060
I'm trying!

377
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,760
Alright.

378
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,060
Oh, of course it stops raining now.

379
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,960
Yay!

380
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,140
Yay!

381
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,880
Nothing bad is going to happen in those five seconds.

382
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,680
Yay!

383
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,020
Oh, shit.

384
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,940
Oh, fuck.

385
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,200
Okay.

386
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,920
There we go.

387
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,600
We did it!

388
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,880
Did I pass?

389
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,120
You think I did really good?

390
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,360
You think I did really good?

391
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,060
I did?

392
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,840
Oh, don't worry.

393
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,180
I can replace them.

394
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,140
Yay!

395
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,780
I did it!

396
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,880
Yoki, what do you mean by replace?

397
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,760
Don't worry, I'm going to replace her right now.

398
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,460
I'm going to...

399
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,460
Because I'm going to replace her right now.

400
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,060
Oh, yeah.

401
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,100
I remember this was beta.

402
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,300
Beta, alpha, beta...

403
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,440
Wait, which one?

404
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:34,860
Oh, yeah.

405
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,740
Yeah, this...

406
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,380
Was this beta?

407
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,600
Beta, alpha, beta, alpha.

408
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,600
I remember.

409
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,520
Choose four!

410
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,640
They're beta, though!

411
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,820
Wait, wasn't one of them used to be omega?

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,700
Did they change the type?

413
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,320
I remember one of them was an omega.

414
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,480
Did they change one of the types?

415
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,440
Alright.

416
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,560
We're going to be an alpha wife.

417
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm going to have an alpha wife.

418
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,820
Four.

419
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,800
Do you guys really, really want me to pick four?

420
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,000
Do you really want me to pick four?

421
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,040
Dang, they're all...

422
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,580
No!

423
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,460
Three!

424
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,560
No, ducky!

425
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,660
We want the alpha.

426
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,720
Alright.

427
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,480
Okay.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,020
Alright, we're going back to what we know.

429
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,300
What do we could do?

430
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,060
We could do one.

431
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,620
Okay.

432
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,200
I don't know.

433
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,260
They're all so cute.

434
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,040
I think I had three last time, right?

435
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm pretty sure.

436
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,860
I'm really happy.

437
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
Alright, do we want someone new?

438
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,440
Do we want default lady?

439
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,840
Default lady?

440
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,960
Three?

441
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,920
Or him?

442
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,460
We could take all of his clothes...

443
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,020
We could technically take his clothes off.

444
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,920
Like, to make...

445
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,100
One for variety.

446
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,260
Alright, alright.

447
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm going to give you guys a poll, guys.

448
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,220
One, two, or three.

449
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,120
Which anime...

450
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,920
Which anime...

451
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,300
Waifu should we get?

452
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,540
One, three.

453
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,900
I like how two is not even an option.

454
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,560
Two is nobody's option.

455
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,940
Matrix, thank you for the super chat.

456
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,040
Thank you, thank you.

457
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Skibity Toilet collab.

458
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,540
Drops on Fortnite tomorrow.

459
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,080
And I gotta remind everyone to use the creator code ToadKeeper tomorrow.

460
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,440
I can't believe Skibity Toilet is going to be part of Fortnite.

461
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,280
Because I'm like thinking, doesn't Valve own the models, technically?

462
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,980
Like, how did they get away...

463
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,440
How did the fucking person who created Skibity Toilet get away with all of it?

464
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,560
Because it's literally a fucking Valve model.

465
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,300
Like, it's like...

466
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,780
Stop saying those words.

467
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,400
I don't know how they got away with it, because it's also a Halloween costume.

468
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,320
Okay.

469
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,560
Guys, I like how four is a very vocal minority.

470
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,780
Like, the people in chat is like, four!

471
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,040
But it was like, just like a very tiny percentage of them.

472
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,120
And then all the lurkers are like, you are not making...

473
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,360
I am not...

474
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,880
I am here to lurk, and you are not giving me four.

475
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,800
It's not fair.

476
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,100
Like, if I look at chat, it looked like four was the most popular vote.

477
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,760
But they were just very vocal about what they love.

478
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,160
Our love for four is true.

479
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,120
Alright.

480
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,740
Okay, it's...

481
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,580
Oh, it's very close.

482
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,360
I'm gonna wait until the votes hit a thousand before...

483
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,700
Ultra model S can become 9S.

484
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm just saying.

485
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,440
Isn't like...

486
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,400
Isn't that a guy?

487
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,460
Isn't 9S...

488
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,360
Wait, 9S...

489
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,160
Oh wait, 9S is also...

490
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,560
Okay, I was thinking about the other one.

491
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,700
Yeah, but like...

492
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,740
We don't care about 9...

493
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,000
Wait, I shouldn't say that.

494
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,520
Because I have never played...

495
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,480
I have never played Nier before.

496
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,860
And I'm worried that people are like, I care!

497
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,480
I care about 9S!

498
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,040
Alright.

499
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,000
Alright, I'm gonna give you a countdown.

500
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,600
Five...

501
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,980
Oh, I think 3-1.

502
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,260
We're going back to the classic.

503
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,420
Okay, weather...

504
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,400
Weather gazer.

505
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,640
Cradle support.

506
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,760
What is...

507
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,940
I forgot what they do.

508
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,000
Okay, weather gazer specializes in weather.

509
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,480
Specializes in cradle maintenance.

510
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,500
Significant increases repair kit.

511
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,000
Which one's good for PvP?

512
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,580
Displays ender's health features that facilitates cradles and analytic.

513
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,900
Okay, 3 is the winner.

514
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,060
Guys, which one's great for PvP?

515
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,560
A system special...

516
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,240
Guys, if you read this...

517
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,420
If you really want 4...

518
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,020
Damn me.

519
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,120
You should download Sinuality right now.

520
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,000
And get 4.

521
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,200
Cradles health features that restrains any...

522
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
Oh, wait.

523
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,380
This is good.

524
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,140
Yeah, 3.

525
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,300
3 for PvP.

526
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:08,740
Yeah.

527
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,500
Guys, if you really want 4, you can also have 4 for your own...

528
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,120
For your own mecha fight.

529
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,440
Alright.

530
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm trying to remember, like...

531
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,980
Oh, is this new?

532
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,360
Oh, my God.

533
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,860
I love Latina.

534
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,680
Oh, my God.

535
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,620
Okay.

536
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,540
I still like the default one.

537
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,140
I don't know.

538
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,920
I think default one has always...

539
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,760
Has been, like, the best so far.

540
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,560
Alright.

541
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,240
She's gotta be...

542
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,960
I gotta have...

543
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,040
Oh, okay.

544
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,360
Maybe not that.

545
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,460
Whoa.

546
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,720
Okay, maybe a little.

547
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,540
Short kings, rise up.

548
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,420
It's time.

549
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,120
It's time.

550
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,580
Alright.

551
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,440
Let's see.

552
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,740
I like her normal hair color.

553
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,560
Not gonna lie.

554
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
Actually, I just...

555
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,100
I like her default hairstyle a lot more.

556
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,860
Oh, wait.

557
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,660
But...

558
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,580
Oh, wait.

559
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,700
Oh, my God.

560
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:22,980
Wait.

561
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,260
Okay.

562
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,840
Some of these hair...

563
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,020
Okay.

564
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,600
These are...

565
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,800
I don't think this was a feature.

566
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:27,980
Okay.

567
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,060
Maybe not that.

568
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,380
Oh, my God.

569
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,540
She's a little...

570
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,480
She's a...

571
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,680
She's, like...

572
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,240
A little special.

573
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,040
Because, like...

574
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,660
She dyed one streak of her hair...

575
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,280
Red.

576
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,700
Oh, my God.

577
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,680
But then she could...

578
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,280
She could be the mom that dies in every anime, though.

579
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,520
Yeah, these are new.

580
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,500
These are new.

581
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:47,880
Yeah.

582
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,480
I don't know.

583
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,760
Wait.

584
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,860
These are all so cute.

585
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,900
I don't...

586
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,120
Maybe I should get the mom hairstyle.

587
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,440
She could be the...

588
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,720
The mom that dies in the beginning of the episode.

589
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
The mom hair.

590
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,980
It's the mom hair!

591
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,120
It's, like...

592
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,460
It's, like, basically, like...

593
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,700
You know?

594
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,800
People with, like...

595
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,580
Mommy issues.

596
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,620
Because they're, like...

597
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,840
My mom died in that one anime episode.

598
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,480
So, they recreated her into, like...

599
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,040
A...

600
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,660
Oh, no.

601
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,420
That's really bad.

602
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,940
Never mind.

603
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,680
Because I remember there were, like...

604
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:17,860
Supposed to be, like...

605
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,240
So, like, that's really bad.

606
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,840
That's really bad.

607
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,340
And my mom will always be there.

608
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,700
But it's so cute.

609
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,360
It is.

610
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,920
It's so cute, though.

611
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:34,960
Alright.

612
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,500
Honestly, I like how it looks so far.

613
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,160
She's really cute.

614
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,900
Okay.

615
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,620
I think...

616
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,900
I think I like this.

617
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,020
Alright.

618
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,020
Let's see.

619
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,640
Oh, no.

620
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,280
The back...

621
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,000
No, you're right.

622
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,560
Guys.

623
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Oh, my god.

624
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,640
But it's such a cute hairstyle.

625
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,040
But then I realized...

626
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,560
The bathtub scene is not...

627
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,400
Is not it.

628
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,160
Like...

629
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,580
Like...

630
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,900
Oh, my god.

631
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,520
No.

632
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,620
You're right.

633
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
You're so right.

634
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,500
Okay, guys.

635
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,200
We're gonna...

636
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,060
We're gonna change the hairstyle.

637
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,820
I...

638
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,420
I can't be responsible for that.

639
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,920
I can't be responsible for that.

640
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,000
We're gonna...

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,360
Oh, my god.

642
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Oh, my god.

643
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,940
They're all so cute.

644
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,160
They're all such cute hairstyles.

645
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,360
I don't know.

646
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,220
I'm so bad.

647
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,900
Oh, wait.

648
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,300
That's...

649
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,360
That's sort of me.

650
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,600
That's like retro me.

651
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,220
Wait.

652
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,860
I could...

653
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,140
Okay.

654
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,420
It's me.

655
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm gonna...

656
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,500
I'm gonna put myself in here, too.

657
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,800
It's me.

658
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,300
Okay.

659
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,620
We're gonna do that.

660
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,020
Oh, but I still wanna be...

661
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,080
I wanna be tall.

662
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,620
Alright.

663
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,480
Let's see.

664
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,880
Okay.

665
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,640
Okay.

666
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,520
Okay.

667
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,720
We gotta...

668
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,540
We gotta be more accurate here with the...

669
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,420
We gotta be a little accurate here.

670
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,180
You know?

671
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,080
You know, guys?

672
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,780
We just...

673
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,740
We're just trying to be for accuracy.

674
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,740
You know?

675
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,380
Just...

676
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,540
Just trying...

677
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,460
Alright.

678
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,000
I think that's good.

679
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,540
Okay.

680
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,560
Yeah!

681
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,780
What's the makeup?

682
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,260
We're just gonna spend our entire time right here, I feel like.

683
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,920
It doesn't feel like it changes.

684
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:35,970
Okay.

685
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,710
We'll do two.

686
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,350
And then...

687
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,110
Eyeshadow.

688
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,350
I don't know.

689
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,670
I think default is fine.

690
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,350
Honestly.

691
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,990
Oh, blush!

692
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,690
Hi!

693
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,870
Alright.

694
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,070
Mouth shape.

695
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,430
I think normal is fine.

696
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,190
Alright, there we go.

697
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,870
That's fine.

698
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,130
Woah!

699
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:03,970
Nice.

700
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:04,750
Alright.

701
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,930
Which one's the real Doki?

702
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,210
This one's the real Doki.

703
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,290
Not Doki and real Doki.

704
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,250
Alright.

705
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,230
Yeah, that's fine.

706
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,650
Oh my god, that's me!

707
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,610
I made myself.

708
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,180
See?

709
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,220
I made her.

710
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:38,860
Oh wait!

711
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
Fuck the eye color!

712
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,160
Oh my god!

713
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,360
I'll change her later.

714
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,400
I...

715
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,980
I...

716
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,900
The one thing I forgot is the eye color.

717
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,080
I was paying attention with like so many other things and I forgot what my eye color was.

718
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,360
You don't look at your own eyes!

719
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,560
That's what I'm saying!

720
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,320
Okay, can you really blame me?

721
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,100
I don't look at my eyes, okay?

722
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,940
I look at other stuff.

723
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,860
Yeah, you can.

724
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,040
I'm pretty sure you can edit.

725
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:09,920
Alright.

726
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,180
I'm gonna change your eyes.

727
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,880
Okay.

728
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,540
Real Doki.

729
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,140
Fake.

730
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,960
Yeah, what's wrong with it?

731
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,140
This is my bachelor pad.

732
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,940
You like it?

733
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,250
That is giving me BAPTA PTSD.

734
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,050
Alright, before we do all that, I'm gonna change you.

735
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,630
Oh, is that the remake ticket?

736
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,470
Is that it?

737
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,150
Oh shit.

738
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,830
Oh yeah, guys!

739
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,330
Pre-order!

740
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,350
It's gonna be on sale on January 24th!

741
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,810
And y'all, access at Jan...

742
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,330
Oh, thank you.

743
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,330
Thank you, game, for helping me with my sponsor.

744
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,430
On January 17th.

745
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,930
So you can pre-order it now!

746
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:13,890
Woo!

747
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,470
There's gonna be some pre-order bonuses as well.

748
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,710
So make sure you check...

749
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,490
Oh my god.

750
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:19,850
Okay.

751
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:20,830
Alright.

752
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,150
Oh, I can't...

753
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,710
Wait, can I?

754
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:23,990
Okay, it's time.

755
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:25,570
Oh wait.

756
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,890
How do I...

757
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,310
Alright.

758
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,850
It's fine.

759
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:38,010
I used my one ticket just to change your eye color.

760
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,550
It's worth it.

761
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,450
I just...

762
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,890
My one ticket is just for the eyes.

763
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,390
Guys, you don't understand.

764
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,670
It's worth it, guys.

765
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,330
It's so worth it.

766
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,430
Okay.

767
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,890
Alright, let's see.

768
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,210
Eye color, both.

769
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,670
Okay.

770
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,370
I want both of them to be...

771
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,610
It doesn't even change that much!

772
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,630
Are you serious?!

773
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,010
My one edit doesn't even change that much!

774
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,490
I'm so sad.

775
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,810
I'm so...

776
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,450
Okay.

777
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,310
Don't worry.

778
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,130
It's fine.

779
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,390
It's fine.

780
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm trying to figure out what color makes it pop, makes the green pop up more.

781
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,530
Okay, maybe it's this one.

782
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,250
Maybe?

783
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,170
Is there other green?

784
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:30,970
Oh, there it is!

785
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,870
Oh, there it is!

786
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,590
Oh my god.

787
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,310
This was yellow this entire time.

788
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,530
I couldn't tell.

789
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,990
Guys, I swear I'm not coloring.

790
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,870
I didn't realize.

791
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,390
Okay, there we go.

792
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,990
This color or...

793
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,690
Oh, I like this green more.

794
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,010
This green or this green, guys?

795
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,730
Which one?

796
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,770
This green or this green?

797
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,510
Or the lighter green?

798
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,150
Alright.

799
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:02,950
You know what?

800
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,910
We'll go with this one.

801
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,990
Alright.

802
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,470
I think I like this one.

803
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,030
Oh, wait.

804
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,510
Okay, we can...

805
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,550
145.

806
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,610
Oh my god.

807
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,990
Do not be afraid.

808
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,810
It just kicked in.

809
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,010
I got the catnip.

810
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,210
You know, I thought when it says eye size, I thought it would be like...

811
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,510
I thought it would be like this eye size.

812
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,370
Alright, there we go.

813
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,910
My one edit.

814
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:34,890
Yes.

815
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Alright, here we go.

816
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,660
Yes, I literally used my one edit for that.

817
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,320
That's fine.

818
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,640
Okay, now we gotta wear new clothes.

819
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,260
Okay.

820
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Oh, I don't like the jacket.

821
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,180
I'm gonna take the jacket out.

822
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,240
Where's the jacket?

823
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,760
I love the innerwear more, I think.

824
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,640
I think the innerwear looks so cute.

825
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,740
Versus like...

826
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,480
Oh, shit.

827
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,500
Whoops.

828
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,020
Wait, was it this?

829
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,280
It's this, right?

830
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,640
Okay, no outerwear bottoms.

831
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,400
There we go.

832
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,920
I just think like this is so cute.

833
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,500
In general.

834
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,640
What are you guys looking at?

835
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,820
My eyes are up here.

836
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,440
My eyes are...

837
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,560
My eyes are up here.

838
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,800
What are you looking at?

839
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,940
Alright.

840
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,180
Let's see.

841
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,560
Or we can have a jacket with it.

842
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,560
No, I think I personally...

843
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,180
I personally think...

844
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,960
I think this is really cute.

845
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,640
Okay, shoes.

846
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,640
And then we'll do yellow shoes.

847
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,300
And then...

848
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Wait, I can have wings?

849
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,740
Oh my god, this game has everything.

850
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,620
I can have wings.

851
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,340
What was it?

852
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,600
This was the original, right?

853
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,880
Uhh...

854
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,640
Yeah, I like this outfit more.

855
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Alright, there we go.

856
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,480
You're beautiful now.

857
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:19,980
Alright.

858
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,080
Prep, pre-order now.

859
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,420
Oh, we have requests.

860
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,520
Welcome to the life of a brand new drifter.

861
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,980
We're in complete missions.

862
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,940
Alright, we don't need to know all this because we're here to kill.

863
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,160
Bounty hunter ranking.

864
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,320
Alright, and who's gonna be killing me?

865
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,700
Wait, is there no bounty hunters?

866
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,820
Oh, it's connecting.

867
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,300
I wanna see the other drifters.

868
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,340
I wanna see what they look like.

869
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,080
I wanna know who's gonna...

870
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,140
Who's gonna be hunting me down.

871
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,060
We're here for...

872
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,160
We're here for murder.

873
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:54,620
Yay!

874
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,740
I'm still connecting to the rankings though.

875
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,200
Connecting?

876
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,100
It says connecting.

877
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,800
Oh, there it is.

878
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,420
This is the ranking of drifters affiliated with the association that compete.

879
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,380
You can collect a large sum by defeating the higher ranked bounty targets.

880
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,280
Alright.

881
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,160
I like how you can...

882
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,320
Oh my god, wait, is that...

883
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,320
Don Don and Don Don Don girl?

884
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,420
Wait, I think that is.

885
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,120
Wait, she looks like the...

886
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,160
I like to see like...

887
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,500
What they look like.

888
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:45,140
Cause you can tell like what their type is by like how they dress their magus.

889
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,600
So I thought...

890
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,400
Wait, what?

891
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,160
Wait!

892
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,100
No!

893
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,180
There was a person with...

894
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,100
I like how the person with four doesn't exist anymore.

895
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,320
There used to be like several people with four.

896
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,220
With the beta guy.

897
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,580
In the...

898
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,240
In the closed network test.

899
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,980
Yeah, we're just...

900
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,620
Oh, this guy.

901
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,880
This guy likes moms.

902
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,440
I like how everybody has a sweater though.

903
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,820
This guy.

904
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,120
Are we gonna see our first...

905
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,380
When are we gonna see the first one with a male magus?

906
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,420
Are we...

907
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,820
Are we gonna find any of them?

908
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,580
They're all waifus.

909
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,720
There's zero...

910
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,980
There's zero...

911
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,160
There's zero men.

912
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,260
They're all waifus.

913
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,220
Guys.

914
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,540
This ain't looking good for the beta lovers.

915
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,040
It ain't looking good for you guys.

916
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,020
I don't think I've seen...

917
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,160
I don't think...

918
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,140
I've seen a single beta here.

919
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,380
It's just...

920
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,500
It's all threes.

921
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,080
Threes and ones.

922
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,420
You know what that means.

923
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,820
Oh my god, excuse me?

924
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,240
Like...

925
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,600
Okay, that guy...

926
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,000
That guy has other things in his mind.

927
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,480
Like, oh my god.

928
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,340
It's cold!

929
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,900
She's cold!

930
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,780
Get her a jacket!

931
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,860
She's so cold!

932
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,580
Oh hey, there's two!

933
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,960
This guy likes...

934
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,120
Am I allowed to say it?

935
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,000
I was gonna say, this guy is a certain...

936
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,100
Okay, I...

937
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,320
I can't say that.

938
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,280
Probably...

939
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,840
Alright.

940
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,280
Alright, I caught myself before I could, guys.

941
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,000
I caught myself before...

942
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,120
Before I could.

943
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,880
I...

944
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,240
I stopped myself.

945
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,060
I stopped myself.

946
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,720
Alright.

947
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,880
Oh, they made one of the Arknight girls?

948
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm not at brand risk.

949
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,500
Oh wait, isn't that, like, from...

950
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,180
Wait, actually, 51st...

951
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,780
I'm at 51st yet, now.

952
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,020
Guys...

953
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,400
Guys, you can't even...

954
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Guys, it ain't looking so good for foreign joyers, guys.

955
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,150
You are a very, very vocal minority.

956
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,380
Oh wait, that's...

957
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,660
Hey!

958
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,500
That's Evangelion.

959
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,320
Oh my god, that's so cute.

960
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,900
Oh my god, that's so cute.

961
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,380
I don't think I've seen a single one.

962
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,020
Oh my god.

963
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,380
We're at 51 right now.

964
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:09,990
We're...

965
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,440
We're at 51.

966
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,180
Where are they?

967
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,960
Not even one person has number 4?

968
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,540
Not even one?

969
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,780
There's no way.

970
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,810
I can't believe not a single one in the top 100 has...

971
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,290
Is using...

972
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,390
Is using number 4.

973
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,030
We're at 70.

974
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,930
We're at 70 now.

975
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,490
This ain't looking so good.

976
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,450
So this is the meta.

977
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,130
Portal for beta not found.

978
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,390
Huge loss for the bro.

979
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,190
Bro, I just wanted a homie.

980
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,050
Oh my god.

981
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,070
Thank you for...

982
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,090
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

983
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:03,990
Welcome, welcome.

984
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,370
We're at 81.

985
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,750
20 left.

986
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,730
Guys, maybe...

987
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,290
Guys, maybe we'll get...

988
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,050
Maybe it's at the last 20.

989
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,210
Guys, you don't know that.

990
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,590
Guys, you don't know that.

991
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:23,670
Maybe...

992
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,310
Oh, 88.

993
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:26,790
What?

994
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,350
Oh.

995
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,450
Okay.

996
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,050
Is that a 2 or a 4?

997
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,050
Whoa.

998
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,530
That's just...

999
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,750
Oh, last 10.

1000
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:55,910
Last 10.

1001
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,170
93.

1002
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,650
94.

1003
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,850
95.

1004
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,270
96.

1005
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,490
97.

1006
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,130
98.

1007
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,110
99.

1008
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,950
Alright.

1009
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,510
There's one left.

1010
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,030
One more left.

1011
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:24,630
Guys.

1012
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,790
Are you willing to bet your life savings that I could be number 100?

1013
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,430
Are you...

1014
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,010
No way.

1015
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,330
Trust.

1016
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,890
It's over.

1017
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,090
Alright.

1018
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,750
But she's cute though.

1019
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,450
That's crazy.

1020
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,210
Oh my god.

1021
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,770
In the top 100, number 4 doesn't exist.

1022
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,930
Wait, look.

1023
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:59,870
They literally went through all 1 to 100.

1024
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,050
They don't...

1025
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,210
It doesn't exist.

1026
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,930
It doesn't even fucking exist.

1027
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,850
That's so funny.

1028
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,450
He's so cute.

1029
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,690
I really like his design.

1030
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,730
Rest in peace, buff dudes.

1031
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,130
No barra for you.

1032
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,090
Sad day for the bros.

1033
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,730
I need a bro shoulder to cry on, bro.

1034
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,850
I love the animation.

1035
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:46,730
It's so cute.

1036
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,250
Bro.

1037
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,330
Cas, thank you for the super chat.

1038
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,490
Thank you, thank you.

1039
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,230
For the gamers who's not here for the horny.

1040
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,950
They just want a bro...

1041
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,850
They just want a bro-lationship.

1042
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,360
That's me.

1043
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:12,800
Bro.

1044
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,500
We just want a bro.

1045
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,520
This is a bro-tastrophe.

1046
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,600
Bro.

1047
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,440
Wait, apparently there's like bounty tar...

1048
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,280
Oh yes, cle...

1049
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,520
Oh my god.

1050
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,260
I'm sorry.

1051
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:29,720
She's...

1052
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,380
She's washing my dish...

1053
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,620
She's washing my clothes.

1054
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,360
I'm sorry.

1055
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,200
Wait, is there like...

1056
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,700
There's like other rankings too?

1057
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,100
Guys, sorry.

1058
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,640
We're gonna be back in the loading screen.

1059
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
We're gonna be back in the loading screen.

1060
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,780
Guys, I wanna know like the...

1061
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,420
The bou...

1062
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,920
Maybe they're all bounty tar...

1063
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,320
Maybe they're just PvPers, chat.

1064
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,300
That's it.

1065
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,060
That's it.

1066
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,760
The...

1067
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,540
The bounty hunters are...

1068
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,340
Are the...

1069
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,480
Are everybody else.

1070
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,140
And then the PvPers are the bros.

1071
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,740
You know?

1072
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,920
Bro, I just wanted to see my bro wash up.

1073
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,620
That's...

1074
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,980
Maybe that's it.

1075
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,420
Maybe that's it.

1076
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,300
Oh my god.

1077
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,240
Maybe that's it.

1078
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,480
Maybe you're here.

1079
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,720
Oh, I like how this guy's just default.

1080
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,120
He's like, I'm not here for the anime waifus.

1081
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,380
I'm here to be a gamer.

1082
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,300
I...

1083
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,820
Maybe that's it.

1084
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,320
Maybe you're just...

1085
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,540
Oh, I knew it!

1086
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,260
Oh my god!

1087
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,300
There he is!

1088
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,860
GeForce GT!

1089
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,000
What?!

1090
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,900
There he is, guys!

1091
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,740
I knew it!

1092
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,300
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted.

1093
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,140
I knew it!

1094
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,420
He's real!

1095
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,700
He's there to...

1096
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,660
He's there to...

1097
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,000
He's there to kill.

1098
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,860
Oh my god, and he has a 1030!

1099
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,280
Oh my god!

1100
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,560
He has a...

1101
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:52,980
T...

1102
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,420
T1030, guys!

1103
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,340
A Nvidia T1030.

1104
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,620
I fucking knew he exists.

1105
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,040
I knew it.

1106
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,560
I knew he was...

1107
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,460
He was a fucking fighter.

1108
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,020
God, I wanted a chair.

1109
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,500
I knew it.

1110
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,660
I knew it.

1111
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,240
And...

1112
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,820
And the fact that...

1113
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,480
That he...

1114
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,720
He's not here to play by the rules, chat.

1115
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,680
He's here...

1116
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,120
He's here to fucking...

1117
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,340
He's here to fuck!

1118
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,680
And he's top 5!

1119
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,340
That's right.

1120
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,360
That's fucking right.

1121
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,120
Our pro here.

1122
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,660
Alright.

1123
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,220
Let us...

1124
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,080
It's PvP time.

1125
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,100
I knew they existed.

1126
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:33,820
I...

1127
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,960
I knew it.

1128
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,380
Okay, Northern Stone.

1129
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,140
If you lose items, you can select which item you want.

1130
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,460
Do I have...

1131
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,580
Everything I want?

1132
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,860
Automate or replenish?

1133
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,420
Okay.

1134
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,920
They're replenished already.

1135
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:48,940
Alright.

1136
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,050
I forgot to change my settings, but that's okay.

1137
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,110
We'll do it right here.

1138
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:58,910
Oh, that's right.

1139
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,890
Get in the robot.

1140
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,370
4 is saved.

1141
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,010
I knew there was representatives for 4.

1142
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:08,810
That's me.

1143
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:09,750
That's real Doki.

1144
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,010
That's real Doki and not Doki.

1145
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,290
Oh, we don't need insurance.

1146
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,390
It's the first level!

1147
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,670
How bad can it get?

1148
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,110
We don't need insurance here.

1149
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,200
Alright.

1150
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,660
Okay, let's...

1151
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,960
I forgot to...

1152
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,880
Guys, I forgot to...

1153
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,200
Oh, wait.

1154
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,700
Motion blur.

1155
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,080
Guys, I forgot to fix my settings.

1156
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,020
Alright.

1157
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,320
We gotta find...

1158
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,860
Is there anything here?

1159
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,980
Why is there a little cubby hole here?

1160
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,880
There's nothing here.

1161
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,880
Yeah, this has...

1162
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,260
It's PvPvE.

1163
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,200
Oh my god, guys.

1164
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:14,840
Give me a second.

1165
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,000
Maybe if I close some tabs.

1166
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,360
It all fails.

1167
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,280
It's time to close some tabs.

1168
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,560
Maybe I should close...

1169
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,200
I don't remember.

1170
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,860
Is there...

1171
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,500
There's no graphic settings yet, right?

1172
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,620
Because I remember that like...

1173
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,640
There's like no graphic settings for...

1174
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,820
For the network test.

1175
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,380
Right?

1176
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,520
Or is there...

1177
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,180
I don't remember.

1178
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,980
Do you guys remember?

1179
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,260
Remember if there's like graphic settings?

1180
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,620
I closed three tabs.

1181
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,220
There were...

1182
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,500
Oh, it's in the home base.

1183
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,180
Okay, guys.

1184
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:58,800
We're gonna...

1185
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,920
We're gonna have to go power through this.

1186
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,360
He's so...

1187
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,940
He's dead.

1188
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,260
Alright, nice.

1189
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,800
Let's excavate real fast.

1190
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,460
What is that?

1191
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,560
No, that's a...

1192
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,580
That's just a bad guy.

1193
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,660
Dragoons.

1194
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,440
Sign up for the open network test right now.

1195
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,160
So I can...

1196
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,480
So I can PvP you.

1197
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,360
Come on.

1198
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,140
PvP me.

1199
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,120
Get in here, Dragoons.

1200
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,080
Come on.

1201
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,340
Don't you wanna PvP?

1202
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,200
Oh, my God.

1203
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,120
Look how...

1204
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,600
Look how vulnerable I am with the over...

1205
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh, wait.

1206
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,160
What's this?

1207
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,300
Nice.

1208
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,520
With the overclock.

1209
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,340
Oh, my God.

1210
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,480
I'm overheating.

1211
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,880
Oh, I can't run.

1212
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:45,840
Oh, no.

1213
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,220
What would I do?

1214
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,960
I can't run.

1215
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,140
Oh, no.

1216
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,900
Oh, no.

1217
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,580
Alright.

1218
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
Don't you wanna fight me?

1219
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,880
Whoa.

1220
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,460
It's gonna be so easy to kill me, guys.

1221
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,060
Oh, my God.

1222
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,700
Wouldn't it be so easy right now?

1223
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,060
Where's my melee?

1224
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,520
Where is my melee?

1225
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,000
Okay.

1226
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:25,780
Give me a sec.

1227
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,460
I need to figure out what my melee is.

1228
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,660
Show tutorials on screen controller settings.

1229
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,120
Okay.

1230
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,100
Keyboard.

1231
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:33,740
Wait.

1232
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,560
What's that?

1233
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:35,980
What the fuck?

1234
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,700
What the fuck?

1235
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,620
Why is he green?

1236
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,420
Wait.

1237
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,200
He's green.

1238
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,180
Why is he green?

1239
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,300
Wait.

1240
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:45,820
I don't remember this.

1241
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,680
Other than being green?

1242
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:48,660
Okay.

1243
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,960
Move back.

1244
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,740
Move right.

1245
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,320
Stop.

1246
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:51,760
Jump.

1247
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,380
Action.

1248
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,020
Switch.

1249
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,840
Twitch to attack.

1250
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,360
Melee is E.

1251
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:56,780
Okay.

1252
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,640
I don't...

1253
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,060
Custom.

1254
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:00,860
Okay.

1255
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,300
There we go.

1256
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,080
That should be...

1257
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,520
Actually, no.

1258
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,820
This should be back.

1259
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,780
What the fuck?

1260
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,060
What are you doing here?

1261
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,620
What are you doing here?

1262
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,140
Oh, no.

1263
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,660
It's raining.

1264
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,500
Oh, no.

1265
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,360
Oh, no.

1266
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,200
Oh, no.

1267
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,180
Give me a sec.

1268
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,000
Oh, no.

1269
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,440
It's...

1270
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,300
Oh, it's raining.

1271
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,340
I didn't realize.

1272
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,500
Oh, it's not raining.

1273
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,500
I was just...

1274
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,320
I'm just crazy.

1275
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,040
Okay.

1276
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,080
I need to make my melee.

1277
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Switch weapon.

1278
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,160
Switch weapon.

1279
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,220
Melee.

1280
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,540
Apply.

1281
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,120
Okay.

1282
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,540
There we go.

1283
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:34,660
Alright.

1284
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,320
We got...

1285
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,540
We got melee now.

1286
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,800
Good.

1287
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:40,980
Hello.

1288
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,920
Is there anything here?

1289
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,560
Oh, wait.

1290
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,440
There's more supplies.

1291
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,040
I don't remember what my mission is.

1292
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,480
I've just been so preoccupied with PvP that I legitimately don't remember what my mission was.

1293
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,540
Okay, nice.

1294
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,080
Oh, they are?

1295
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,100
Oh, yeah, you are.

1296
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,260
Hey.

1297
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:07,660
Hey.

1298
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,500
Hello?

1299
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,500
Where are they?

1300
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,220
Oh, I know you were excavating.

1301
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,080
I know you were around.

1302
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,420
Wait, where is he?

1303
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,260
There he is.

1304
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,960
There he is.

1305
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,740
Look at him.

1306
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,100
There he is.

1307
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,180
There he is just casually rolling around.

1308
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,000
There he is.

1309
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,720
Wait.

1310
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,160
Wait, what?

1311
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:46,840
Wait.

1312
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,320
Wait, he's shooting me?

1313
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,720
He's shooting me?

1314
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,080
What the fuck?

1315
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,920
I didn't think...

1316
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,400
I thought I was in...

1317
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,240
I didn't...

1318
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:06,640
What?

1319
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,000
He's shooting me?

1320
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,660
This is not over.

1321
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,980
This is not over.

1322
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,820
This is not fucking over.

1323
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,820
I am...

1324
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,300
I refuse this to be over.

1325
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,480
That's fucking right.

1326
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:23,980
Get out of here.

1327
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,060
That's right.

1328
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,880
That's fucking right.

1329
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,580
Leave.

1330
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,820
I can't PvP.

1331
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,380
You wanted PvP.

1332
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,160
I didn't think...

1333
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,180
What's my skill?

1334
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,760
I don't know what I did.

1335
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,240
Oh, I basically restrained them.

1336
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:44,940
Oh, fuck.

1337
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:45,320
Okay.

1338
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,140
Guys, this is so bad.

1339
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,580
Like, I'm...

1340
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,420
This is so bad.

1341
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,760
I wasted that.

1342
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,220
I didn't know what it was.

1343
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,120
Oh, no.

1344
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:58,860
This is so bad.

1345
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,220
Do I have heals at all?

1346
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,560
Do I have...

1347
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,760
We'll just use it for now.

1348
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,560
That's right.

1349
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,280
Get in here.

1350
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:09,800
Get...

1351
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,500
This is so bad.

1352
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,800
Where's my heal?

1353
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,920
I don't remember how to heal, guys.

1354
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,280
Guys, get into this little circle.

1355
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,670
That's right.

1356
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:29,130
Get out.

1357
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:30,690
That's right.

1358
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,830
I'm gonna shoot you.

1359
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:32,910
That's right.

1360
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,610
Get closer and you get shot.

1361
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,130
That's right.

1362
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,850
That's right.

1363
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:40,890
I'm not friendly.

1364
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,730
I'm not friendly.

1365
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,530
That's right.

1366
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,170
Show yourself.

1367
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,390
I'm not friendly.

1368
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,030
That's right.

1369
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:49,550
Jump.

1370
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,610
I'll shoot you.

1371
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:56,950
Oh, shit.

1372
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,650
Oh, shit.

1373
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:58,570
No, I'm sorry.

1374
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,310
Guys, let me heal.

1375
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,390
Let me heal.

1376
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,630
I'm taking forever to heal.

1377
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:07,830
Okay, wait.

1378
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:08,370
Pause.

1379
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,110
Pause.

1380
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,650
Let me heal first.

1381
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,170
Pause.

1382
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,510
Pause.

1383
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,330
Pause.

1384
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,370
Pause.

1385
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,890
I'm trying to figure out how to heal.

1386
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,710
Guys, how do I heal?

1387
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:24,810
Okay.

1388
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,050
Pause.

1389
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:26,930
Pause the fight.

1390
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,810
Guys, pause.

1391
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,450
Alright.

1392
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,250
Nice.

1393
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:33,510
Okay.

1394
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,930
Okay.

1395
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,290
Okay.

1396
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:34,930
Pause.

1397
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:35,830
Don't get closer.

1398
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:36,850
Don't you dare.

1399
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,230
Don't you dare get closer.

1400
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,570
Don't you dare get closer.

1401
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,550
Don't you fucking dare.

1402
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:43,890
Woah.

1403
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:44,550
Woah.

1404
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:45,250
Woah.

1405
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,410
Oh, my god.

1406
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,450
You fucker.

1407
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,730
This is it.

1408
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,510
I said pause.

1409
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:02,890
I said...

1410
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,470
Guys.

1411
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,170
There's time outs in every fight.

1412
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,670
There's time outs.

1413
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:16,550
Guys, what happened to the integrity of pauses?

1414
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,030
What happened?

1415
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,110
Oh, no.

1416
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,410
I never left.

1417
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,190
We did it.

1418
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:29,790
We successfully escaped.

1419
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,870
You can't pause.

1420
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,050
Yes, I can.

1421
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,030
Pause.

1422
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,250
Oh, my god.

1423
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,930
What the fuck is an ender swarm?

1424
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:50,770
Yeah.

1425
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,770
I was a loot delivery service.

1426
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,970
Where's the part where I try to PvP?

1427
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,580
Guys, it's not my fault.

1428
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,340
They didn't respect the time outs.

1429
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,540
It's like sports where each team gets one time out per session.

1430
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,460
Where the fuck was my time out?

1431
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,680
This is where I saw PvP.

1432
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,820
Stupid fucking Jake.

1433
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,300
Fuck you, Jake.

1434
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,040
Yeah, fucking run, Jake.

1435
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,220
That's right.

1436
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,140
Wait, and then he came back?

1437
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,800
That's right.

1438
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,020
Oh, Jake keeps coming back.

1439
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,400
That's right.

1440
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,020
Oh, Jake.

1441
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:43,900
Get away.

1442
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,620
Get away, Jake.

1443
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:46,960
That's...

1444
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,260
Oh, wait.

1445
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,100
Actually, it's all...

1446
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,080
No, I won!

1447
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,000
Jake!

1448
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,300
It's not fair!

1449
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,040
It's not fair!

1450
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,640
He healed!

1451
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,920
This fucker healed.

1452
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,140
God damn it.

1453
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,920
Jake from State Far.

1454
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,780
It wasn't fair!

1455
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,480
No!

1456
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,480
My last item!

1457
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:22,060
Why didn't you guys tell me to get insurance?

1458
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,690
Guys!

1459
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,480
Why didn't you tell me to get insurance?

1460
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,900
We could've avoided all this if I had insurance.

1461
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,520
Yeah,

1462
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,420
I think so too.

1463
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,520
I think so as well.

1464
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,140
Alright.

1465
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,180
Prioritize performance.

1466
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:53,700
Yes.

1467
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,820
The game will return.

1468
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:56,220
Okay.

1469
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,360
We gotta prioritize performance right now.

1470
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,400
I'm sorry.

1471
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,580
You're gonna have to look a little less pretty.

1472
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,350
My anime...

1473
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,660
Real Doki.

1474
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,220
Okay, this should work now.

1475
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,280
This should be better.

1476
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,820
Alright.

1477
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,160
Start game.

1478
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,080
Okay.

1479
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:20,800
Okay.

1480
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,300
I figured it out.

1481
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,260
I figured it out now.

1482
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:27,040
Yes.

1483
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,220
I figured it out.

1484
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,620
It was just a fluke.

1485
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,700
We don't need insurance.

1486
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,360
Good morning.

1487
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,460
Real Doki.

1488
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,760
Alright, let's see.

1489
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,460
I think that's...

1490
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:38,340
Anti -alias.

1491
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,880
Changing display mode.

1492
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,100
Prioritize performance.

1493
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:42,780
Alright.

1494
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,020
That should be...

1495
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:44,920
I know how to heal now.

1496
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:45,460
Exactly.

1497
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,200
Exactly.

1498
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,020
Guys.

1499
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,540
I know how to heal.

1500
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,740
So everything will be okay now.

1501
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,520
I know how to heal.

1502
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,160
Things will be fine.

1503
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,440
Oh my god.

1504
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:01,840
Okay.

1505
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,460
What can we do to fix the settings a little bit?

1506
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,840
Do we have to change anti-aliasing?

1507
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,920
As well as choose different modes?

1508
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:11,080
It's alright.

1509
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,100
We'll be fine.

1510
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,760
Things will be fine.

1511
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,940
Things will be so healthy now.

1512
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:18,920
Alright.

1513
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:19,580
Let's see.

1514
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,420
Woah.

1515
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,280
All she does is wash my clothes.

1516
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,920
That's her only purpose, I guess.

1517
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,680
Oh, wait.

1518
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,180
Nice!

1519
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,360
See guys?

1520
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,200
Things are fine.

1521
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,380
It gave me free stuff.

1522
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,360
Okay.

1523
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,400
We have...

1524
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,560
What is this?

1525
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,300
We don't need this.

1526
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,680
This is...

1527
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,120
Okay.

1528
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:44,560
It's fine.

1529
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,600
We're going back in.

1530
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:51,370
Alright.

1531
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:51,950
This is it.

1532
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:54,930
She's already better than...

1533
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,190
Real Doki is already better than not Doki.

1534
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,610
Because she actually cleans.

1535
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,490
She actually washes dishes.

1536
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,290
Oh my god.

1537
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,190
She's already such an improvement.

1538
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:14,920
Alright.

1539
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,560
This is fine.

1540
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,160
Alright.

1541
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,200
We'll be fine.

1542
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,300
Okay.

1543
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,240
This one.

1544
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,320
And then this one.

1545
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,880
This is a shotgun.

1546
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,580
Okay.

1547
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,580
Alright.

1548
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,200
I'm ready.

1549
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,920
I'm ready, Jake.

1550
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,520
I'm fucking ready, Jake.

1551
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,160
Get over here.

1552
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,040
That's right.

1553
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,380
Challenge me!

1554
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,120
Will anyone...

1555
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,620
Is anyone here to challenge me?

1556
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,460
Come on.

1557
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,620
Where's my rematch, Jake?

1558
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,120
Get your ass over here.

1559
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,680
Fucking leave your world and come back here.

1560
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,340
I'm ready, Jake.

1561
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:05,700
Okay.

1562
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,080
We gotta kill this guy.

1563
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:13,880
That's right.

1564
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,620
What is he gonna do?

1565
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,280
Kill me?

1566
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,400
Come on.

1567
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,580
Where are all the drifters?

1568
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,740
Where are you at?

1569
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,320
Come on.

1570
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,340
I'm right here.

1571
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,100
That's right.

1572
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,780
Get back here, Jake.

1573
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,900
I want my fucking revenge.

1574
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,480
1v1 me, Jake.

1575
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,180
Jake, dunk on her.

1576
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,980
No, this time it'll be different.

1577
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,620
It'll be so different.

1578
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,120
You see, if he hunts me down too much, he's gonna become a bounty target.

1579
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,600
What's my ammo situation right now?

1580
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,160
Okay, it's fine.

1581
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,540
174 is fine.

1582
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,820
There you go.

1583
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:01,400
That's right.

1584
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,280
Oh, shit.

1585
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,400
Nice.

1586
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,080
See?

1587
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,500
So easy.

1588
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:11,440
Come on.

1589
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,680
Where are all the cradles at?

1590
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,220
Where'd you at?

1591
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,180
Oh, woah, average?

1592
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:21,820
Woah.

1593
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,460
Well, don't say that.

1594
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:24,700
Woah!

1595
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:25,780
No!

1596
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,080
Oh my god.

1597
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:31,700
Thank you.

1598
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,060
Wow.

1599
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,460
Thank you, RealDoki.

1600
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,440
I wouldn't have known that they explode.

1601
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,220
No.

1602
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:37,580
No.

1603
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,020
No.

1604
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:38,440
No.

1605
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,180
No.

1606
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:39,460
No.

1607
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:39,580
No.

1608
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,120
Okay.

1609
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:46,360
Okay.

1610
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,840
I need you to repair me.

1611
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,260
Alright, here we go.

1612
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,660
Thank you, RealDoki.

1613
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,140
I really appreciate the repairs.

1614
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:56,680
Alright.

1615
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,000
Okay, now!

1616
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:58,660
Now, Jake!

1617
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,680
Now you can show up.

1618
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,280
Alright, Jake.

1619
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,020
Now you can show up.

1620
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,020
I figured it out.

1621
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,620
Alright, let's get excavating.

1622
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:13,910
Oh, they are?

1623
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,970
Oh, this takes us so long to excavate.

1624
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,450
Hey, you wouldn't shoot me while I'm excavating, right?

1625
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,990
That'd be a little fucked up.

1626
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,370
Are you trying to kill me while I'm trying to excavate?

1627
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,350
That's so fucked up.

1628
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:34,930
Chaser, stay there.

1629
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:35,870
Stay there, Chaser.

1630
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,290
Stay there!

1631
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:42,750
Okay, nice.

1632
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,770
Alright, nice.

1633
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:48,930
Okay, there's Chaser right there.

1634
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,430
Alright, he's feeling it right now so we can ignore him.

1635
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,310
Okay, there was a cradle.

1636
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,090
Is he still trying to figure out how to find a door?

1637
01:08:58,670 --> 01:08:59,030
Okay.

1638
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,990
I know there's a guy here.

1639
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,190
There was a guy here.

1640
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:04,070
Come on!

1641
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,250
Where you at?

1642
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,510
Oh, I know what to do.

1643
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,030
I'm gonna say hi to them.

1644
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,730
And then, like, wait for them to come close to me.

1645
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:14,290
And they'll think I'm a good person.

1646
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:17,950
Where did he go?

1647
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,570
He's over there.

1648
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,830
That has to be him.

1649
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,830
Is he up there?

1650
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:29,870
Hello?

1651
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,250
Oh no, not the rain.

1652
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:37,390
Not the rain.

1653
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,810
Oh, where's the cover?

1654
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,050
Where's the cover?

1655
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:42,690
No!

1656
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:44,490
No!

1657
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,550
Not the acid rain!

1658
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,530
No!

1659
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,430
There's no cover anywhere!

1660
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,310
He's over there, though.

1661
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:57,830
He's over there.

1662
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,430
Oh no, I can't.

1663
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:02,410
I can't find any cover.

1664
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,270
I can't.

1665
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,310
Oh, hey!

1666
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,450
Hey.

1667
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,250
Yeah?

1668
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:22,650
Say hi back!

1669
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:25,670
Nice!

1670
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:28,770
Understood.

1671
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,090
Well, let's step in the rain.

1672
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:36,450
Yeah, let's go!

1673
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,170
We gotta find cover together, friend!

1674
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:48,230
Let's find cover together!

1675
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:49,790
Come on!

1676
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,520
Yeah?

1677
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,910
We're such good friends!

1678
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:08,370
Right?

1679
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,230

01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,170
Yoink.

1685
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,410
No.

1686
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,850
I need to get rid of stuff.

1687
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,550
Give me a sec.

1688
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,310
How do I get rid of it?

1689
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:53,830
How do I-

1690
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,250
It was worth it.

1691
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:08,090
I think I would catch you.

1692
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,690
It was so worth it.

1693
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,310
It was so worth it.

1694
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,890
He trusted you!

1695
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,210
That's fine.

1696
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,530
Let's get this fully up.

1697
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:28,650
He trusted you and it's so fucked!

1698
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,690
PvP successful.

1699
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,610
Let's go home.

1700
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,550
Let's go home.

1701
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:44,530
We did our job.

1702
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:50,330
She must be punished.

1703
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,970
What did I do?

1704
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:55,670
You were there for the whole plan!

1705
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:58,710
You were part of the problem.

1706
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,270
You were also there for the plan.

1707
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:07,850
I told you guys my plan very early on.

1708
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,670
No, no, no, no!

1709
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:12,070
No!

1710
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,830
What did I do?

1711
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,910
Oh my god.

1712
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:28,830
Oh my god.

1713
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:34,350
Oh my god, I just wanted to use the- Oh my god, I just wanted to-

1714
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,350
Oh my god, oh my god.

1715
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,670
Oh my god, no.

1716
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,170
No.

1717
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,590
I can't believe Karma exists.

1718
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:49,610
I can't believe Karma existed.

1719
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:52,490
There's no way.

1720
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,410
There's no way.

1721
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,310
Wait, can they hit me in the elevator?

1722
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,410
No!

1723
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:09,310
No!

1724
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,450
You're such a bitch!

1725
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,190
My elevator!

1726
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,980
Can I open it again?

1727
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,800
Can I open you again?

1728
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,100
No!

1729
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:28,900
Okay.

1730
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,860
Okay, that's fine.

1731
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,340
It's not Karma, I'm still alive.

1732
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,200
I'm still alive, it's not Karma, guys.

1733
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
It's not Karma.

1734
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:38,940
Karma!

1735
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,080
Don't worry, Karma won't get me.

1736
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,300
Don't worry, I'm friend.

1737
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,400
I'm friend, see?

1738
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,780
Hello, I'm friendly.

1739
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,340
Hello, I'm friendly.

1740
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,900
Hello, I'm so friendly, guys.

1741
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,960
I'm so friendly.

1742
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,360
Oh my god.

1743
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:08,340
Oh my god, oh my god.

1744
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,320
I'm so friendly.

1745
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,240
Guys, I'm so friendly.

1746
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,040
Look, look guys.

1747
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,500
Yay!

1748
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,240
I'm a good person.

1749
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:20,340
Yay!

1750
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,320
I'm so friendly, everybody.

1751
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,780
I would never hurt anyone.

1752
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:29,900
I would never hurt anyone.

1753
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,860
Who did I even kill?

1754
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,900
We're all friendly here.

1755
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,640
I didn't...

1756
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,200
She got away with murder.

1757
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,240
What's wrong with society?

1758
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,100
What's wrong with this world?

1759
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,100
Can't believe she got away.

1760
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:53,860
Alright.

1761
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,560
When did I kill him?

1762
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:57,800
Where was he?

1763
01:15:59,260 --> 01:15:59,860
Alright.

1764
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,360
And then...

1765
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,140
Oh, and then I'm like, hi!

1766
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,140
Hi!

1767
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:05,640
Oh wait, no.

1768
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:09,040
Wait, where was the part where I killed somebody?

1769
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,180
Okay.

1770
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,420
Okay, times two.

1771
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:16,760
Where is he?

1772
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,860
Where is he?

1773
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,280
Oh, there he is.

1774
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:24,620
Oh wait.

1775
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,220
No, that's not him.

1776
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,380
Where is he?

1777
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,720
Oh, is it cement liquor?

1778
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:38,920
Is that him?

1779
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:41,800
Wait.

1780
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,980
Is that him?

1781
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,280
I think it is.

1782
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,680
Oh wait, no.

1783
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,380
It has to be...

1784
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,960
Oh no.

1785
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,620
Wait, you don't even see him.

1786
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,760
SilverEye at 512.

1787
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:56,440
The fuck?

1788
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,360
Where does 512 come from?

1789
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,020
Oh, there he is.

1790
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,340
Oh, he's just there to look at the weather!

1791
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,660
Wait, that's so sad!

1792
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,760
He was literally there.

1793
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,120
He was literally there to look at the weather.

1794
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,440
He's not even...

1795
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,300
He's actually...

1796
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,080
He was just...

1797
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,960
He was just a weatherman.

1798
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,180
He's literally...

1799
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,900
His skill was just to be a weatherman.

1800
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,480
I killed...

1801
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,580
I killed the...

1802
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,380
I killed the weatherman!

1803
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,740
Terrible day for a raid.

1804
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,700
This fucker.

1805
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,480
This guy.

1806
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,080
Bro, fuck this guy.

1807
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,220
Who even are you?

1808
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,040
Alright, that's fine.

1809
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:49,940
I got my PvP.

1810
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,720
Guys, I did it.

1811
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,720
I did a PvP.

1812
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,080
Poor weather girl.

1813
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,920
Where's my crystal haul?

1814
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,740
Let's cash out our haul.

1815
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,640
What did I get?

1816
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,080
Oh my god!

1817
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,300
Shoutout to that guy who farmed it for me.

1818
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,320
It's a new payout record.

1819
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,780
Moving on, here's a rundown of the items you've obtained.

1820
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,220
Looks like you got some...

1821
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:15,880
Oh shit, wait.

1822
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,820
What happened to my eyes?

1823
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,240
Whoops.

1824
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,180
Nice.

1825
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,280
And now, let's take a look at the request progress you've made.

1826
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,380
Bring it back.

1827
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,440
Oh hey, nice.

1828
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,420
I did it.

1829
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,880
Yeah.

1830
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,420
How did I do, Association?

1831
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,340
Did I do okay?

1832
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,160
Oh.

1833
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:48,840
Whoops.

1834
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,220
No, don't shun me!

1835
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,700
No!

1836
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,640
No!

1837
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:00,000
I mean, like, we just had two weather people.

1838
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,780
They couldn't shun me.

1839
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,040
Now, I'm gonna be put on the no-fly list, chat.

1840
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:14,600
I killed one person, and now that makes me a bad guy?

1841
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,720
What happened to forgiveness?

1842
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:17,620
Huh?

1843
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:18,940
What happened?

1844
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,480
As long as I confess to my sins, all should be forgiven.

1845
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,220
Is that not what Jesus would have wanted?

1846
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,260
Is that?

1847
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,880
Yes, it does.

1848
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,740
If I go to confessional right now and be like, I'm sorry, Father, for I have sinned.

1849
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,280
I accidentally killed a weatherman.

1850
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:38,260
But I definitely did not mean to.

1851
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,560
And then everything would be fine, as long as I repented.

1852
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:44,280
So I shouldn't be shunned after that.

1853
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:50,980
Alright, I learned a lot today.

1854
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,940
I learned how to...

1855
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,280
I know if I just be like, hello!

1856
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,440
Hello!

1857
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,440
I did it!

1858
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,780
Also, how's the sound for her?

1859
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,060
Do you hear her?

1860
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,940
Oh, I'm marketable.

1861
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,980
Oh, very low?

1862
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,180
You guys should have said something!

1863
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,580
There you go.

1864
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,500
I put it higher.

1865
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:27,700
Alright.

1866
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,060
Oh, I can... Okay, I should get another request.

1867
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,160
Alright, we got another one.

1868
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,700
Oh, we got... We finished this.

1869
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,040
Some real Jeff from Marvel rivals became here to shake my head.

1870
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:42,500
Lord, grossest.

1871
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1872
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,440
Thank you, thank you.

1873
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,060
I got another one!

1874
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,540
I'm an adult.

1875
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,960
Here's the thing to learn about requests.

1876
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,120
Just complete them.

1877
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,800
Thank you.

1878
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,300
Thank you, Mr. Plushie guy.

1879
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:22,040
Yay!

1880
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,640
The more quests you complete, the more you'll have available to you.

1881
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:26,980
Yay!

1882
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,540
The more weathermen I can kill.

1883
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:37,300
Alright, let's see.

1884
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,680
Upgrade your craft station.

1885
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:43,180
Okay, we gotta get... Upgrade craft station and defeat the Mount of Enders.

1886
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,740
Okay, and then...

1887
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,080
Oh my god.

1888
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,420
This place is a fucking dump.

1889
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,360
But the rent's cheap at least, you know?

1890
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:52,540
Repair your garage.

1891
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,240
Try repairing the walls and ceilings.

1892
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,580
Alright, I should be able to.

1893
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,280
Upgrade my wall.

1894
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,980
Alright, at least the walls will look a little better, right?

1895
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,240
Yay!

1896
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,540
We're not doing the bathroom.

1897
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,660
Guys, I cannot commit to another bathroom chat.

1898
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,640
I cannot.

1899
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,800
It was 4 plus hours of grinding, guys.

1900
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,320
I cannot do this all again.

1901
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,880
I got scammed by my wife.

1902
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:30,820
By myself.

1903
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:34,580
She only gave me 2 seconds.

1904
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,310
Oh, real Doki, what did you do?

1905
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,070
Does it sound better, guys?

1906
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:46,430
What did you improve?

1907
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:48,630
There's glass on the floor.

1908
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,190
Doki!

1909
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:53,430
What do you mean?

1910
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:55,790
There's glass on the floor!

1911
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:57,870
You upgraded the floor?

1912
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,910
What do you mean?

1913
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:04,490
You fixed this.

1914
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:07,410
There's glass on the floor, Doki!

1915
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,990
That is not fixing.

1916
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,750
It's okay.

1917
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,870
She's trying her best, guys.

1918
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,970
I'm trying my best right now.

1919
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,430
I'll up the volume a little bit more.

1920
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:29,570
She said she fucking fixed it!

1921
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:32,510
Why is there glass on the floor?

1922
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,650
We're living as good as heart.

1923
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,310
We're living in hard times, Doki.

1924
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,070
Alright, walls and ceiling.

1925
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:45,870
Alright.

1926
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,590
Oh, it's not heisting.

1927
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,690
We're literally here to murder.

1928
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,230
She's perfect.

1929
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,790
She's perfect for you, Doki.

1930
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:02,550
What do you mean?

1931
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:05,790
Alright, she's picking up the weeds.

1932
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,210
She said she would fix the floor!

1933
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:15,130
I don't think you're allowed to eat weeds.

1934
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,890
What did I get?

1935
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:33,950
These nutrient-rich weeds will be a perfect main dish tonight.

1936
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:35,710
My main dish?

1937
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:37,290
I need protein!

1938
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:40,910
Wait, this is like... I'm looping.

1939
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:42,210
I remember this.

1940
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,450
I'm actually looping.

1941
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:46,590
She did this before.

1942
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:48,210
Please, wife.

1943
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,490
Please, Doki.

1944
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,910
I need protein.

1945
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:53,710
This cannot be the main dish.

1946
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,930
I can't eat.

1947
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,070
Just eat grass.

1948
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,050
Oh, yay!

1949
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:05,150
Craft station!

1950
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,420
Did I do it?

1951
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:20,900
Did I do it, Doki?

1952
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,060
You can do all this, but you can't clean fucking glass.

1953
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,040
Like, what's wrong with you?

1954
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,560
Yay!

1955
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,960
The pit space?

1956
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,160
Alright, nice.

1957
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:49,740
We did it.

1958
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,500
Now we can fucking craft now.

1959
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,660
Alright, station one.

1960
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,040
Do I need to craft anything?

1961
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:56,970
I feel like...

1962
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:57,820
Oh, yeah.

1963
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:58,860
Excavator part.

1964
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:00,620
Materials.

1965
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,700
Whoa!

1966
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,960
That's a lot of stuff.

1967
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,980
Oh, and I got consumables, too.

1968
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:06,940
Okay, pit space.

1969
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:07,820
Can I upgrade it?

1970
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,040
No, I need degraded plastic piece.

1971
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:10,960
Okay, that's fine.

1972
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,300
Alright, give me my money.

1973
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,000
I did my job.

1974
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:20,220
I made my... I made real Doki to do my job for me.

1975
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,980
I contracted it out.

1976
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,860
Alright, nice.

1977
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,380
And then... Is it time?

1978
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,520
Okay, we need degraded plaster pieces.

1979
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:31,300
Okay, we gotta...

1980
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,260
We gotta put some stuff away.

1981
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:33,360
Okay.

1982
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,060
Alright, so...

1983
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,440
We don't need this.

1984
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:38,800
Okay.

1985
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,680
Move to...

1986
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,600
How do I move this?

1987
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,880
Oh, repair equipment.

1988
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,320
Ten thousand...

1989
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,020
Wait, it's... Oh, ten... Okay, it's not that much.

1990
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:53,800
Alright.

1991
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,280
Repaired everything.

1992
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,820
And then...

1993
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,460
Move, move.

1994
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,980
Move this.

1995
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,440
We'll keep all of this for now.

1996
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,620
Oh, okay.

1997
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,360
Music and sound effects down.

1998
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,120
Okay, that's cool.

1999
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:09,760
I'll do that.

2000
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,940
Okay, and then... Automated.

2001
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:12,740
Okay, items.

2002
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,320
Alright, there we go.

2003
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,380
That should be good.

2004
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,600
Alright, and then we'll fix the audio a little bit.

2005
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,960
We'll put that at 60.

2006
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,680
And then we'll put that at 60.

2007
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:27,200
And then we'll raise...

2008
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,360
Alright, that should be good.

2009
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:28,960
Alright.

2010
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,610
Can I buy...

2011
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,350
Faster legs?

2012
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:39,130
Oh, I can't.

2013
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:39,770
Not yet.

2014
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,490
I want to buy faster legs.

2015
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,650
My legs are too...

2016
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,610
My legs are so...

2017
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,590
They're so...

2018
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:49,610
They're so short.

2019
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:51,930
I need faster legs.

2020
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:55,390
No, I don't have the recipes yet.

2021
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:00,150
Oh, it's alright.

2022
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,890
Maybe I can kill somebody for faster legs.

2023
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:04,330
Alright.

2024
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:06,730
We don't need insurance.

2025
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,430
I have a starter kit on.

2026
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:10,870
Alright, it's time.

2027
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:14,890
Alright.

2028
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,130
Here we go.

2029
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,480
Maybe some guy would have faster legs.

2030
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,660
I'm gonna kill somebody for better legs.

2031
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:31,440
I'm gonna amputate their legs and then sew it onto mine.

2032
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:34,540
Yoki, that is the wild thing you said today.

2033
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,060
It's time.

2034
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:41,920
Time!

2035
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,620
It's time.

2036
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,600
As long as I confess to my sins, I will be forgiven.

2037
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,260
I'll be forgiven as long as I confess.

2038
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,620
Oh my, you're right.

2039
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,220
You know what they say about four legs.

2040
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,700
Jake, where are you, Jake?

2041
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,520
Where the fuck are you, Jake?

2042
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,820
I'm waiting for you.

2043
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,400
I know you're here.

2044
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,860
I'm gonna find you, Jake.

2045
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,620
I'm gonna fucking find you.

2046
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:24,820
Nice.

2047
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:26,020
Nice.

2048
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,300
Come on, Jake.

2049
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,300
I know you're here.

2050
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,740
I know you're still around.

2051
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,040
You've been playing this game.

2052
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,400
You can't fucking get away from me, Jake.

2053
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,620
Okay, we're- Oh my god!

2054
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,160
Are you at the exit?

2055
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,140
Okay, we gotta slowly head to the exit.

2056
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:53,820
Alright, we gotta just- There has to be people just like walking around the exit, so I'm just gonna slowly walk over there.

2057
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,140
You can find him and stay- Bro, the exit's like a thousand five hundred meters away!

2058
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,360
Oh, there's too much grass here.

2059
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,540
Too much- Oh my god, it's too beautiful.

2060
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,140
The grass polygons is insane.

2061
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,120
I don't need to worry about the chaser.

2062
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,360
Oh wait, I do need to care about it.

2063
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,200
Oh no.

2064
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,940
Oh no, where's cover?

2065
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,760
Where's cover?

2066
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:24,720
How do I get cover?

2067
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,440
Oh my god, there's- There's a bridge right here!

2068
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:32,360
Come on!

2069
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:34,560
Get your legs working!

2070
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,420
Okay, I'm okay, guys.

2071
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,500
I'm okay now.

2072
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,200
Oh shit, what the fuck were you doing here?

2073
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,280
Nice.

2074
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:50,400
Nice.

2075
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,540
I'm glad that he came to me.

2076
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,780
Is it still raining?

2077
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:57,960
Hello?

2078
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,600
Is it still rain- Oh, it is.

2079
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,060
God damn it!

2080
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:03,120
Control the weather!

2081
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:08,180
Where's my- Ever since I killed the weather boy, it's never stopped raining.

2082
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,380
Is this karma?

2083
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,540
Ever since.

2084
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,240
It never stopped raining.

2085
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,100
Weather boy, please come back.

2086
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:22,940
Weather boy.

2087
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,220
Please come back.

2088
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm sorry.

2089
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,800
I'm sorry I killed you.

2090
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,760
It was just- You were just there.

2091
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,340
You were there.

2092
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,700
It was just so easy.

2093
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,320
You were like, Hi, I'm Paul.

2094
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,120
And I was like, Hi, I'm also Paul.

2095
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,640
I couldn't help it.

2096
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,700
He was just there.

2097
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,440
So vulnerable.

2098
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:50,200
I'll be like, She's not sorry.

2099
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,740
I am.

2100
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,640
I'm so sorry.

2101
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,720
I didn't mean to.

2102
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,260
Is it still raining?

2103
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,900
Oh my god!

2104
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,780
Okay, it stops.

2105
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:09,620
Okay, it's stopping.

2106
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:09,920
It's stopping.

2107
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,340
I'll take care of his family and his wife.

2108
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,100
Don't worry.

2109
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,700
Do not worry about his wife.

2110
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,500
I'll be there for her.

2111
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,660
Don't worry.

2112
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,520
Oh, wait, we need to- Yeah, we need to hunt this guy.

2113
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,040
Come down!

2114
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,700
Get down!

2115
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,840
Oh, wait, but there's- There's excavating here.

2116
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:40,860
Nice.

2117
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,140
Regulus, you should sign up right now to the open network test.

2118
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:46,340
And then you too.

2119
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,680
You too can be part of it.

2120
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,340
And then I'll be like, Hi!

2121
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,260
Hi, I'm friendly!

2122
01:32:56,780 --> 01:33:08,160
Guys, if you come over here, if you sign up right now, right into my server right now, you'll be the one who I don't shoot because you're gonna be the special one.

2123
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:11,060
Guys, don't worry.

2124
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,900
You'll be the special one who I don't kill.

2125
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,280
It could be you.

2126
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,400
Don't trust her.

2127
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,980
No, we can work together, Dragoon.

2128
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,500
We can work together and kill the non-Dragoons together.

2129
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,080
Guys, it's a trap.

2130
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:36,100
Believe me, I would never do such a thing.

2131
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,080
I'm not a terrible person.

2132
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,700
See, I'm just shooting...

2133
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,640
See, guys?

2134
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:46,120
I'm just shooting PvE.

2135
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,440
Guys, I would never...

2136
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:54,900
In my mind, it's just PvE.

2137
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,920
It was just a one-time thing.

2138
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,320
Pay used to be believable.

2139
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,600
How is this not believable?

2140
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,880
I don't understand.

2141
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:12,680
I'm just a little bird trying to make it in this world.

2142
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,700
Oh, you know what that means.

2143
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,640
A faint sound of an engine.

2144
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,320
A faint sound of an engine, guys.

2145
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:40,150
Oh, he's right there.

2146
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:43,470
He's right there.

2147
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,810
Oh, I see him.

2148
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:50,050
He's right there.

2149
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,730
Oh, he's right there.

2150
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:02,750
What's his name?

2151
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,110
Oh, he's right there.

2152
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,800
Wait, there's more than one.

2153
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,520
There's another one right there.

2154
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:26,200
Alright, is he a good person?

2155
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,880
Oh, there he is!

2156
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,320
Hi!

2157
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,540
Hey!

2158
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:39,000
Are we good friends?

2159
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,520
Can we be friends?

2160
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:46,940
Hey!

2161
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:48,200
Friend?

2162
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,500
Friend?

2163
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:54,620
What about you?

2164
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,600
You wanna be friends too?

2165
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,380
Oh my god, he's gonna be friends!

2166
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:05,990
Wait.

2167
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,270
Look, friend.

2168
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:17,310
Friend?

2169
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,440
Let's go, let's work together.

2170
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,180
Look, we're friends.

2171
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,420
All three of us.

2172
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,560
Hey guys!

2173
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,460
Oh my god.

2174
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,220
WHAT THE- OH MY GOD, WHAT?!

2175
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,140
THAT'S SO FUN!

2176
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,940
What the fuck?

2177
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:04,840
Oh my god, I was- Oh my god!

2178
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,840
I had self-protection!

2179
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:09,240
Oh, this is a fight club!

2180
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,840
What the fuck?!

2181
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:15,200
I actually got into a fight club!

2182
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:17,220
Holy shit!

2183
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:26,020
I actually got into a fucking fight club!

2184
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,620
Jesus Christ!

2185
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,220
Oh my god, that was an accident.

2186
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:34,360
I didn't realize this was a fight club.

2187
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:43,680
I just wouldn't- I was just trying to bait.

2188
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,500
I was like, welcome to fight club.

2189
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,080
Overloaded?

2190
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,740
I don't need this.

2191
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:51,400
Okay.

2192
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:56,800
Oh shit, degraded burst rifle.

2193
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,080
Oh my god, what's this?

2194
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,400
Wait, what is this?

2195
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:03,960
Is this a good gun?

2196
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,160
Oh my god, wait.

2197
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:07,760
Really?

2198
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:08,380
For me?

2199
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,160
Okay, give me a sec.

2200
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,660
I need to put some stuff away.

2201
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:21,780
Oh, I stole their wo- I stole- I stole his woman!

2202
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:24,240
That's right, it's mine now!

2203
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,180
I stole it!

2204
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:32,600
Oh, it's the gun I killed him- Oh, I basically- That was a good gun too?

2205
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:33,820
Oh shit!

2206
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:34,760
Wait!

2207
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,660
I want the gun back!

2208
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:37,520
Wait a minute!

2209
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,100
That was a good gun!

2210
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,740
Are we friends?

2211
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,500
Can we be friends?

2212
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:51,780
Can we be friends?

2213
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,120
Friends?

2214
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:54,980
Yeah?

2215
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:56,460
Friend?

2216
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:58,240
Yeah?

2217
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,280
Give me back my gun.

2218
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:13,920
I want that gun.

2219
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,100
I also want that gun too.

2220
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:23,380
That looked like a good gun.

2221
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,600
That looked really good.

2222
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,600
I'm dropping this.

2223
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:31,880
Okay.

2224
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,680
Let's see.

2225
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,520
Wait, how do I- Okay.

2226
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:41,900
Alright.

2227
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,720
There we go.

2228
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,340
Oh, we got a sniper!

2229
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,960
You can't keep getting away with this!

2230
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,780
There we go.

2231
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:54,920
Goodbye.

2232
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,180
Now I leave.

2233
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,180
Now I leave.

2234
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,280
Crime is fun.

2235
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,720
Wait, does he have good legs?

2236
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,340
What was his legs like?

2237
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:16,720
Guys!

2238
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,120
What was his legs like?

2239
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,220
Was it good legs?

2240
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,820
Or bad legs?

2241
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,780
I need to steal good legs.

2242
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,580
I need to steal good legs.

2243
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:28,220
Good legs only.

2244
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,280
They're not default ones?

2245
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:37,700
Oh, that's what I like to hear.

2246
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,680
Oh my god, they are good legs!

2247
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,780
Oh my god, okay.

2248
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,320
What do I get rid of though?

2249
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,380
Oh my god, wait.

2250
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,560
How do I take my legs off and take his legs?

2251
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,100
How do I take his legs?

2252
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,260
I want your legs!

2253
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,720
Okay, I'm gonna drop this.

2254
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:07,320
And I'll drop this and this.

2255
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,380
So I can take your legs.

2256
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,420
I need your legs.

2257
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:12,520
Nice.

2258
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:16,530
Alright.

2259
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:20,330
Alright, there we go.

2260
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:23,890
Alright.

2261
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,390
My legs now.

2262
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:30,610
I don't have inventory space, guys.

2263
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:31,910
I can't.

2264
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,730
My legs now.

2265
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:36,990
I need to figure out how to get back up here.

2266
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:41,970
I need to figure out how to get back up there.

2267
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:48,810
Alright.

2268
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:50,490
Alright, we gotta figure out how to get back up top.

2269
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:52,110
It's fine.

2270
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,030
We don't need the guns.

2271
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:56,550
We got what we came for.

2272
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:59,070
Wait, what?

2273
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:01,130
There's an invisible wall here.

2274
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:03,070
Oh no.

2275
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,270
I'm just stupid.

2276
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,330
We gotta get out of here.

2277
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:13,530
Guys, we gotta get out.

2278
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:15,430
Okay.

2279
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:16,490
Okay.

2280
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,110
It was a 50 that's fine.

2281
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:21,550
We don't need the sniper, guys.

2282
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:23,490
Guys, we don't need it.

2283
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,670
We're fine.

2284
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:28,370
Guys, I can't.

2285
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:37,270
Guys, we gotta figure out how to get out of here.

2286
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:40,750
Oh no.

2287
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:42,590
Oh no.

2288
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:43,650
Oh no.

2289
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:45,150
They're gonna take my legs too.

2290
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,110
Guys, I'm scared.

2291
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:50,950
I'm scared they're gonna take my legs.

2292
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:54,790
I'm scared they're gonna take my legs.

2293
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:57,750
I need to get out of here.

2294
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:00,830
I need to get out of here.

2295
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:03,050
I can't have them take my legs.

2296
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:03,930
I can't.

2297
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:06,370
I worked so hard for these legs.

2298
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:08,770
Oh no.

2299
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:10,170
The po-po's coming.

2300
01:43:10,610 --> 01:43:11,890
The po-po's coming.

2301
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:15,030
I need to keep my legs.

2302
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:17,390
I need to keep it.

2303
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:20,470
Oh my god.

2304
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:23,610
Oh, come on.

2305
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:24,590
Come on.

2306
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,210
Oh, thank god.

2307
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,270
What?

2308
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,490
Oh, okay.

2309
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:41,710
They're just excavating.

2310
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:44,550
Oh, oh.

2311
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:45,450
They're coming.

2312
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:47,750
The cops are coming for the legs.

2313
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:48,450
Say no!

2314
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,770
They- Oh, I lived!

2315
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:52,630
I lived!

2316
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:56,850
There's the leg thief.

2317
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:01,110
I got my legs!

2318
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,010
Let's go!

2319
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:04,590
Let's fucking go!

2320
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,010
Never punished.

2321
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:14,370
I escaped.

2322
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:25,210
I kidnapped I kidnapped their animate wife and I got their legs.

2323
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,410
Let's fucking go.

2324
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:28,230
I'm putting her up for ransom.

2325
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:30,490
You want your animate wife back?

2326
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:34,510
She's right here.

2327
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:36,670
That's crazy.

2328
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:42,150
Clean getaway.

2329
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,610
Who did I kill?

2330
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:48,150
Who the fuck did I kill?

2331
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:53,490
A battle ensued, but we successfully escaped.

2332
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:55,970
Alright.

2333
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,110
Precipitation decreased here.

2334
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:00,350
The rain clouds cleared up here.

2335
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:02,750
This is where I was stuck here for the longest time.

2336
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:06,610
Encountered a chaser at this location.

2337
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:09,530
Okay, the first one was a legit fight.

2338
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:12,870
I killed a real- They shot first!

2339
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:16,410
They shot first, but they were so fucking stupid because I had a shotgun.

2340
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:19,030
Encountered an ender swarm at this location.

2341
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,250
I don't even know who I killed.

2342
01:45:20,430 --> 01:45:21,950
I know whose wife I stole.

2343
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:24,770
Oh, there they are.

2344
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,270
Oh my god, there they are.

2345
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:28,010
They all- Oh, there they are.

2346
01:45:28,410 --> 01:45:31,770
A battle ensued, but we successfully escaped.

2347
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:32,510
We escaped?

2348
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,410
Oh, there it is.

2349
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:36,910
That's Jake!

2350
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:39,890
Oh my god!

2351
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:41,390
It's Jake!

2352
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:46,970
Vindication!

2353
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:50,750
I killed Jake from stage 4!

2354
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:53,430
We fucking did it!

2355
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:55,470
Fuck you, Jake!

2356
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:56,890
Fuck you!

2357
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,470
Get shit on!

2358
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:05,230
I killed Jake and took his fucking legs!

2359
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:06,950
Oh my god!

2360
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:08,590
It's a trophy now.

2361
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:13,990
And there's me and- Here's where we obtained crafting materials.

2362
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:15,250
There's me and the other guy.

2363
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:18,850
Jake and his wife.

2364
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:20,370
I took his wife too!

2365
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:25,890
I took- Oh my god, he ran away.

2366
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:32,290
Oh my god, this other person- I love- I almost- I almost like- Bro, that shit's crazy.

2367
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:32,870
I'm leaving.

2368
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:41,950
He's just like- And then poor poor Samsaru.

2369
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:44,110
Poor Samsaru.

2370
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:47,970
He was like- He was like, friend?

2371
01:46:56,170 --> 01:46:58,610
You're such a menace.

2372
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:02,690
And I stole his legs.

2373
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:07,130
So cruel.

2374
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:11,090
It's the strat.

2375
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:12,270
You don't understand.

2376
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,530
That's the strat.

2377
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:19,290
That's how you win.

2378
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:24,750
Give them a false sense of security and then shoot them in the back of the head.

2379
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:25,970
That's so fucked.

2380
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:27,070
Oh my god.

2381
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,590
That's so fucked.

2382
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:28,650
That's so fucked.

2383
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:32,190
Yay!

2384
01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:34,810
Our haul, guys.

2385
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:36,990
My haul.

2386
01:47:41,150 --> 01:47:43,310
I rescued her!

2387
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:49,230
I- I saved her.

2388
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:53,370
That's- Guys, I saved her.

2389
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:55,390
Oh my god.

2390
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:58,990
I found this poor Magus out here all alone.

2391
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:00,570
Without a player.

2392
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:06,910
Oh my god.

2393
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,190
Guys, look at these things!

2394
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:10,850
There you are!

2395
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,130
Alright.

2396
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:18,490
Alright.

2397
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:21,470
We did it!

2398
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,010
Nice legs.

2399
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:31,930
I saved the wife and beautiful legs from Jake.

2400
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,200
I'm such a wonderful person.

2401
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:37,760
See?

2402
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:42,740
Guys, remember to pre-order it now if you're seeing me have lots of fun.

2403
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:47,620
And also, if you have fun in the open network test, pre-order it now.

2404
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,420
Alright, how do I...

2405
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:51,640
How do I wear my new legs?

2406
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:52,560
Guys.

2407
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,100
This?

2408
01:48:59,100 --> 01:48:59,400
This?

2409
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,540
I wanna wear it.

2410
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,080
How do I wear you?

2411
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:09,970
What happened?

2412
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,930
Wait.

2413
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:13,970
Did I put everything away?

2414
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,930
What happened to my legs?

2415
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:18,310
Why put everything away?

2416
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,270
Put in your leg slot?

2417
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:24,510
Oh, there it is!

2418
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:26,750
Nice.

2419
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,650
And then...

2420
01:49:29,650 --> 01:49:30,750
Alright, nice.

2421
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:31,990
That should be it.

2422
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:34,530
I could put the...

2423
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,470
Alright, nice.

2424
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:38,410
Look at that.

2425
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:40,410
I have...

2426
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:44,070
I wanna be able to carry more weight for the...

2427
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:46,030
Cause I feel like I'm always running out of...

2428
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:47,770
I'm always overloaded.

2429
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:50,770
Alright, let's see if I can...

2430
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:53,490
Parts...

2431
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:54,770
No consumables.

2432
01:49:57,470 --> 01:49:59,410
Oh, do I need like a new body?

2433
01:50:01,530 --> 01:50:03,670
Oh, I completed a request there.

2434
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:08,090
Yeah, but I don't wanna...

2435
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:10,250
Oh, I got new stock!

2436
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:13,690
Okay, I can craft spider arms.

2437
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:18,150
Oh, that's a lot of stuff.

2438
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:22,510
Buy any of the following amount of submachine gun.

2439
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:24,310
Defeat the following amount of enders.

2440
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:27,290
Use the following amount of Magus skills.

2441
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:28,850
Okay, we don't need that.

2442
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:31,090
Item shop.

2443
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:32,650
Oh, these are...

2444
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:36,070
Okay, now I have new arms.

2445
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:39,490
Can only use energy, but optimize their profits.

2446
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:41,550
Allows for height and power against... Wait!

2447
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:43,550
I should get that!

2448
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:46,010
Mine's an energy shotgun, right?

2449
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,560
My shotgun's energy, right?

2450
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,300
Is that it?

2451
01:50:59,670 --> 01:51:01,470
Guys, is it an energy shotgun?

2452
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:01,890
Yeah?

2453
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:03,610
Alright, we're buying this.

2454
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,910
We're buying this then.

2455
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:09,590
It's time.

2456
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:12,510
Alright, prep.

2457
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:14,570
Let me rip this arm.

2458
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:17,610
Oh, yeah!

2459
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:20,510
That's double energy.

2460
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:25,610
Wait, maybe I should upgrade my shotgun too.

2461
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:27,990
Wait, can I have a better shotgun?

2462
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:30,950
No, okay.

2463
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:31,330
I cannot.

2464
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:32,930
Alright, we'll just wait.

2465
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,470
We'll just wait then.

2466
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:39,050
Alright, let's see.

2467
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:40,310
Model.

2468
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,110
Pit space.

2469
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,030
Do I not have it?

2470
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:43,630
No, I don't.

2471
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:44,230
Okay, sort.

2472
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:46,090
Alright, let's do one last job.

2473
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,410
One last job.

2474
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:51,210
What did I want to get?

2475
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:52,990
Wait, I want to repair all.

2476
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:55,390
Repair equipment.

2477
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:01,070
No, it's fine.

2478
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:02,330
What if I lose it though?

2479
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:03,870
Oh, I guess I might as well.

2480
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:05,230
Alright.

2481
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:07,870
It's time.

2482
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:08,990
One last job.

2483
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:13,570
Tips?

2484
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:14,230
What kind?

2485
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:23,710
Don't worry, I'm very well versed with that.

2486
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:29,490
Yeah!

2487
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:34,650
That's me!

2488
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:38,450
That's me!

2489
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:52,030
That's me right there.

2490
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:52,850
Do you see that?

2491
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:54,650
Wow, there were cameras there?

2492
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:55,670
Who would have thought?

2493
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:58,330
Okay, I'm going to get insurance for this though.

2494
01:53:00,490 --> 01:53:03,210
I'm going to get insurance for my legs and my arm.

2495
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:09,530
They're the only insurance I'll get.

2496
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,600
They made a PSA about me ever since I hunted the weatherman.

2497
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,600
I'm a menace to society.

2498
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,040
Now they don't know when it's going to rain.

2499
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,200
It's because of me.

2500
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,180
Where did you get those legs?

2501
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:36,700
Wow!

2502
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,580
Where did...

2503
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,480
Where did I get those legs?

2504
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:45,580
Whoa!

2505
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,640
Okay, where am I?

2506
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,200
Alright, we're going here.

2507
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,660
Oh my god, my legs are so fast.

2508
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:56,000
These legs that I got naturally.

2509
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:04,300
Oh my god, look how fast my legs are that I naturally obtained via hard work and grinding.

2510
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,140
Okay, we're going this way.

2511
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,680
I don't want to fight a fucking boss.

2512
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:12,240
Thanks guys!

2513
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:13,140
I earned it.

2514
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:16,000
I bought it with my own hard money.

2515
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,420
Hahaha!

2516
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,260
On me!

2517
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,320
I don't want to waste this.

2518
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:29,840
Jesus, they're so strong!

2519
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,560
These guys are actually... Oh no!

2520
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,460
Oh no, it's raining.

2521
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:42,140
Oh no!

2522
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:45,200
Oh no!

2523
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:46,100
Oh no, it's raining!

2524
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:46,840
No!

2525
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,880
No, I forgot to...

2526
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:52,340
I forgot to get repair kits!

2527
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:55,240
Oh, this is bad.

2528
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:56,380
This is actually bad.

2529
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,520
Oh no, my legs.

2530
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:59,340
Oh no, I might lose my legs.

2531
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:01,120
I forgot to get repair kits.

2532
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:01,760
No!

2533
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:07,450
I thought I had repair kits.

2534
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:10,370
No!

2535
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:10,790
No!

2536
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,890
Where's the cover?

2537
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:12,710
Where's the bridge?

2538
01:55:15,890 --> 01:55:16,610
Oh no.

2539
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:17,570
Oh no.

2540
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:21,150
This is my cover now.

2541
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:22,950
We're okay.

2542
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:25,670
Wait, does this not cover me?

2543
01:55:26,190 --> 01:55:27,570
Oh, we're not okay.

2544
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:29,570
We're not okay.

2545
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:33,210
Oh no.

2546
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,030
No, no, no.

2547
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,550
Oh no.

2548
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:38,510
I'm okay.

2549
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:42,370
Oh my god, I might die from rain alone.

2550
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:44,690
I might die from rain alone.

2551
01:55:58,710 --> 01:56:01,070
I'm a good person.

2552
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:05,790
Oh.

2553
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:09,290
It's literally acid rain.

2554
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:10,290
What do you mean?

2555
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:12,370
Oh, but he's not new.

2556
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:20,770
Oh my god, wait a minute.

2557
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:22,130
Wait a minute.

2558
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:36,870
What exactly is your problem?

2559
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:40,770
I'm sorry!

2560
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:42,510
I'm sorry!

2561
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:43,930
No!

2562
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:48,430
Oh my god, he's so...

2563
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,670
I'm sorry!

2564
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:53,290
He saw me murder!

2565
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:55,050
He tried to kill me!

2566
01:56:55,570 --> 01:56:56,470
I'll start the repairs.

2567
01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:58,270
He saw...

2568
01:56:58,270 --> 01:57:00,050
He's like, hey, hey, stop that.

2569
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:08,650
He's like, wait a minute, stop that.

2570
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:18,810
He's like, wait a minute, stop that.

2571
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,750
The guy was like, wait a minute.

2572
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:20,670
Oh no.

2573
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:21,650
Oh no.

2574
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:23,130
We gotta leave.

2575
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:26,390
Oh no!

2576
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,290
No!

2577
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:28,710
My legs!

2578
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:31,770
My face!

2579
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:31,990
My legs!

2580
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:33,430
No!

2581
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:38,150
My cool new legs!

2582
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,790
No!

2583
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:44,250
No!

2584
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:54,610
I got hunted down by all of them!

2585
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:57,650
No!

2586
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:01,430
My new shoes!

2587
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:03,130
My shoes!

2588
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:05,610
No!

2589
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:08,890
I lost my legs!

2590
01:58:12,430 --> 01:58:14,450
Was it Jake again?

2591
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:16,470
Oh my god!

2592
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:19,610
No way!

2593
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:21,210
It was Jake!

2594
01:58:21,490 --> 01:58:23,430
Oh you fucker!

2595
01:58:23,890 --> 01:58:26,790
Oh my god, you fucker!

2596
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:30,410
I can't believe Jake took back his legs!

2597
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:30,830
Oh!

2598
01:58:32,050 --> 01:58:32,470
No!

2599
01:58:34,310 --> 01:58:36,110
He took his back!

2600
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:38,590
He took back his legs!

2601
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,330
No!

2602
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:51,970
Did my insurance kick in?

2603
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,590
Did it kick in?

2604
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:54,810
Did I get it back?

2605
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:59,570
How do I know if my insurance kicked in?

2606
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:00,210
No!

2607
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:06,210
Oh my god!

2608
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:09,850
I want problems always!

2609
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:11,730
Not so dead pool!

2610
01:59:12,170 --> 01:59:13,170
No my girl!

2611
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:16,390
She's making mushrooms!

2612
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:20,470
How do I know if my insurance kicked in?

2613
01:59:21,110 --> 01:59:22,470
Oh my god!

2614
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:24,330
I can't collect it yet!

2615
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:28,090
I can't even collect my insurance!

2616
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:30,090
I have to wait an hour!

2617
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:31,290
No!

2618
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:36,110
Alright, I think this is a good point to end it in.

2619
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:38,290
Guys, karma will always get you.

2620
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:43,790
Karma will always find a way to get you no matter what.

2621
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:48,190
I thought I was safe and then Jake came back!

2622
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:51,310
Jake came back and took my legs!

2623
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:59,010
That was fun though.

2624
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:02,510
That was really fun.

2625
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:05,550
I hope you guys enjoyed watching today's sponsor.

2626
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:08,110
Huge shout out again to...

2627
02:00:08,110 --> 02:00:10,770
Jake did not win a 2v1!

2628
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:22,150
I literally was already 1 HP from the other guy that shot me because he saw me kill another person in cold blood and he was like, wait a minute, stop that.

2629
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:25,850
He was like, did I just witness a murder?

2630
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:27,530
Wait, stop that.

2631
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:32,090
He just shot me.

2632
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:33,890
I had to run away.

2633
02:00:36,530 --> 02:00:40,570
And then Jake came back at the last second to finish the job.

2634
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:41,790
I was limping.

2635
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:45,150
Blood was dripping from my fucking legs.

2636
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:46,450
I was limping.

2637
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:51,890
I was delusional with like 30% blood loss as I tried to make my escape.

2638
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:54,670
And then Jake rolls up and goes pop pop!

2639
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:02,310
