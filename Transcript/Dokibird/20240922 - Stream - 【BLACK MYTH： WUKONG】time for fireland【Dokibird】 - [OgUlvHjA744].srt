1
00:01:44,320 --> 00:02:08,840
hello hello hello everybody do I sound okay I know like last time my mic was being weird I don't know I was am I okay this time today oh I am okay nobody's freaking out by my microphone so I believe I'm okay now hello everybody hello sorry for being a little late I just got back from a walk with dad so So the reason why you're like,

2
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
wow, Doki, time management much?

3
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,660
Okay.

4
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,160
Yes.

5
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,820
But okay, I have a reason.

6
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,180
I have excuses ready.

7
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,540
I have excuses ready.

8
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,380
Okay.

9
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,500
So today was the today was the stage I'm slam.

10
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Unfortunately, team Brian didn't make it to the quarterfinals.

11
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,960
But like, okay, so like, basically, um, you know how I commissioned a wig for Sykuno to wear?

12
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,680
Well, what I didn't know was that Sykuno came in with a full fucking cosplay.

13
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Like, I was watching it live.

14
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,920
I was watching it live.

15
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:08,440
So Sykuno came in with a full cosplay of me.

16
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
And like, I gave him the wig.

17
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,580
I like commissioned somebody to hand him the wig.

18
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,600
And he literally he has a jacket.

19
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,560
He has the glasses.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,880
He has a bullet belt.

21
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,400
You see he's wearing a belt for bullets.

22
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,120
He has the pants, the white pants.

23
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,940
He doesn't have cowboy boots or anything.

24
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,760
Honestly, if he had the wig on, he maybe he would be more locked in.

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,660
But the reason why I didn't put the wig on was the fact that like it was it was in his eyes like he couldn't focus with the wig on.

26
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,180
So I didn't put the wig on.

27
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,180
I didn't put the wig on.

28
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,180
I didn't put the wig on.

29
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,660
So he was just carrying it.

30
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:50,340
So unfortunately, they weren't able to make it to the quarterfinals, which really sucked because like, like, at first I was like, it's okay, guys, you guys tried your best.

31
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,500
And then I found out apparently Brian was really mad about what happened.

32
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:05,700
Because there was apparently a one full second of input lag for Sykuno.

33
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,000
SK and the first round of Brawl Pro.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,600
Yeah, apparently it was he was fucking angry that that happened like one full second.

35
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,620
And yes, I've been thinking like, that's not that bad.

36
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,540
Sykuno had to fight Blanka.

37
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,900
I fought Blanka.

38
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,620
One, you need you would you need one full second to prepare for Blanka ball.

39
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,540
You're already fucked.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,100
You cannot you cannot counter Blanka ball.

41
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,860
With one full second.

42
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,960
Because I was like, watching.

43
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,320
I was like, how the fuck are you not dodging the Blanka ball?

44
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,140
You're Cammy!

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,660
You're not Zangief!

46
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,960
Like, I was like, I would've been fucked too.

47
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,020
Because I was on Gief.

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,740
If I cannot play... Gief would have been absolutely destroyed.

49
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,780
No, no, you guys don't understand.

50
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,860
Gief would be...

51
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:16,380
Absolutely destroyed with input lag, because to play Zangief, we need to be able to counter what they're doing.

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,360
That's how we grab.

53
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,820
We grab because they made mistakes.

54
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,580
So, I would have been extra fucked at Zangief, guys.

55
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,060
The only way for Zangief to do anything is being able to counter somebody's mistakes.

56
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,700
I thought I was weird.

57
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,700
Honestly I didn't... It sucked for Esuke and Sycuno, because you know, they are not Street Fighter players.

58
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,580
So they didn't notice that there was an input lag.

59
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,680
They didn't realize there was input lag.

60
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,660
Obviously they couldn't catch it.

61
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,620
But like when BrawlPro and Sfan fought.

62
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,880
I was like, wait a minute.

63
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,800
Why the fuck is BrawlPro playing defender?

64
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,220
I'm sorry to ask that.

65
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,200
But like, you know, BroPro is literally an FGC Pro.

66
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,740
I was like, how the fuck are you getting destroyed, BroPro, in the first round?

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
I was like, how the fuck?

68
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,880
Like, I was like, why are you playing like me?

69
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,760
And then after, yeah, it was actually, it was so fucking weird watching that.

70
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:42,920
And, and like, and then because of that round, round, they, they fixed the TV because they were like, wait, that's fucking weird.

71
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:54,380
Yeah, immediately after round two started, after round two started, they, they were, he was like, he barely got hit.

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,360
It's like, it's like barely could do anything in the second round after they fixed it.

73
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Like, I was like, okay, that made more sense now.

74
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:20,120
Like, um, um, uh, but yeah, anyway, uh, basically people, people were confused.

75
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,760
They're like, that, that was weird.

76
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Cause like when they saw, yeah, S-Ban actually fixed the TV.

77
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Like he knew he was gonna get absolutely destroyed by fixing the TV.

78
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,660
But what a homie for actually fixing, like realizing that.

79
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,580
Something was wrong and he like fixed the TV.

80
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,680
Yeah.

81
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,380
That was like, like a true, a true homie for doing that.

82
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,500
Cause like after he fixed that, he literally got fucking destroyed.

83
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:02,680
Like he could have like not fixed it and then, you know, be bra pro because like I said, as Zangief, as Zangief, it's so hard to play Zangief with like input.

84
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:02,740
It's so hard to play Zangief with like input.

85
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:16,900
Delay and like ping in general, because like when you play, like as someone that plays Zangief, even on Modern, where you play Zangief, you capitalize on other people's mistakes and you can't do that when you're like, when you have input delay.

86
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:32,660
Like, um, um, so it was very unfortunate, but like, I'm still really proud of how far, uh, they got, even with like all the, the, the issue and stuff, um, and everything, you know, they did.

87
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,140
The best they could in the situation they were in.

88
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,040
Um, it was just, uh, uh, it was just very unlucky.

89
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,400
SK 171, 7-1 in the behind the scenes run back.

90
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,760
Oh my God.

91
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,680
I mean, yeah, cause like, she was playing against Modern Ken, right?

92
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,420
Like, so like, even on Modern like all, not Luke, sorry, Modern Luke.

93
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,340
So all he had to do was sand blast and like SK can't like, range characters had so much advantage.

94
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,340
It was just unlucky.

95
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,640
It was just unlucky.

96
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,540
It was just unlucky that the team.

97
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:02,640
It was just unlucky that the team.

98
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:22,980
The team, we were the first, like, they were the first team, they were, oh, he was Classic Luke, sorry, Classic Luke, they were the first team that were playing, so, like, we weren't able to figure it out until, like, the more experienced players, the more experiencing players noticed it.

99
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,500
Um, so that's why, that's why I was unlucky.

100
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:42,340
Of course, like, in the end, it was, like, up to the tournament organizers to decide whether or not to continue it, and I guess due to scheduling issues, I guess they didn't want to, like, uh, they, I guess, like, they felt like it would be really bad if,

101
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:57,660
like, JB's team lost because of, like, uh, because of the rematches and everything, so they were like, well, they already played, uh, so, like, we can't, like, we can't really do much about it, because, like, nobody really wins in that scenario, because we would end,

102
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:14,020
if, like, uh, SK and Sykuno wins those matches, they'd, like, you know, um, people would be like, oh, that's unfair, because, uh, they were able to realize, like, like, how to capitalize on, they can learn what they did in the before matches, um, so, like,

103
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,540
nobody wins in that scenario in the end, um, so I can see why it was just an incredibly rough situation to be in.

104
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:50,300
I mean, I'm biased, and I would have been, like, redo it, you know, like, I'm fucking biased, I would obviously be like, we should have had rematches, I was like, they should have had rematches, because I'm biased to my team, uh, but, like, it's just not a,

105
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,520
not a good place to be in.

106
00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:13,110
To, like, have to decide whether or not, um, whether or not there should have been, like, rematches or not, um, honestly, I would have been there and be like, I'm, I've been, like, revolt, I'd be like, rematch this, and I'd be like, come on, audience,

107
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:23,550
come on, audience, say it with me, peer pressure, peer pressure to, uh, tournament organizers.

108
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:49,390
Live on stream, and then have everybody in the audience be like, rematch, rematch, rematch, rematch, obviously, that's why I'm not there, uh, that's why, that's why I'm not there, because, uh, reset the series, reset!

109
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:11,190
Yeah, sorry, I got a message, um, uh, anyway, uh, I got a message from Surefort, because, uh, Surefort messaged me earlier, and he was like, oh, hey, there's some, uh, Doki Bird artwork at TwitchCon, do you want any?

110
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,890
So he's, like, walking around artist alley by, like, wait, that was really nice of him!

111
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,770
It, like, came out of nowhere, like, haha, like, he, like, shot me a message, he's like, oh, yeah, there's, like, lots of Doki artwork at TwitchCon, do you want any?

112
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:24,430
And I was like, what?

113
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,490
He's like, yeah, I'll take some pictures while I'm walking around, and, uh, I can grab you some.

114
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,290
And I was like, oh, shit, that's so sweet, thanks, man.

115
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:37,490
Um, so he was, like, show, asking me if I wanted a particular, he was just sending me pictures of it.

116
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,890
Yeah, um, you say this as if Surefort is never nice.

117
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,630
He's, he, he doesn't lie.

118
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,270
Even if it makes you feel like shit.

119
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,810
That's all, that's all I'll say, guys.

120
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:14,030
Even, even if he's a very truthful person, that's, like, the best way I could, um, that's, like, the best way I could describe Surefort.

121
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:23,770
Anyway, the reason why I was late to the stream was because, um, um, I decided to, uh, I need to go to the bank today, um.

122
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,310
I need to go to the bank today, um.

123
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:34,330
But it's, like, a very long walk to the bank, and I won't say how long it is, because, you know, I don't want to, like, I don't want to give too much information.

124
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,210
Uh, but, like, I had to go to the walk to the bank.

125
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,110
It is pretty long walk, but, like, I was like, it's okay.

126
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,830
So, like, I watched half the game.

127
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:50,530
Like, I watched until, uh, uh, Rawpoke was playing like me, and I was like, I can't watch this anymore.

128
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:01,230
Hey, I was watching until... I was, like, I watched all the way until, like, Rawpro was like, you know, absolutely sucking ass in the first round.

129
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,830
And I was like, what the fuck is going on?

130
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,110
And so I stopped watching and I was like, I'm going to go to the bank.

131
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,110
Like, I'm going to go to the bank now.

132
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,150
And I literally... I was so mad.

133
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,730
I didn't check the bank hours, because I was like, okay.

134
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,930
Um, yes, he popped off afterwards.

135
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,410
And then, like, I watched it.

136
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,630
And then...

137
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,510
And then, like, I was like.

138
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,070
So I was watching.

139
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,810
I was like, oh shit, wait, he's winning?

140
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,390
And then so I watched a little, like, I watched Brawl Pro's, like, last round.

141
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:40,690
I didn't, guys, I, like, you know, if you saw the first round, if you saw the first round, it was, like, absolutely, like, it was so fucking bad.

142
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,170
And I was like, oh no, I can't, I can't watch this.

143
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,850
I was like, I was like, why is he so fucking bad right now?

144
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,010
I was like, I was like, you were at EVO.

145
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,190
I was like, why were you so, why?

146
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,790
And then, and then I was walking to the, I was walking to, um, the bank.

147
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:17,450
And I pulled out my phone and I realized, uh, and I saw that he was absolutely destroying, uh, destroying in the third round.

148
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,930
And I was like, something's wrong.

149
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,410
How the fuck was he?

150
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,970
So bad in the first round.

151
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,290
And then suddenly, like, it's nothing.

152
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,910
I legitimately was like, oh my God, did Espen, like, is Espen hacking?

153
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,810
Like, I was like, I was like, how the fuck was he able to do all that?

154
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,330
Like, I was like, I was like, oh my God.

155
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,910
I was like, bro, that's so, I was like, it's so different.

156
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,810
It was so different.

157
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,830
And then, and then, like, obviously it wasn't.

158
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,490
But, like, no, you had, no, it's...

159
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:58,250
Actually, it's so fucking weird, um, seeing how the difference, um, the difference between, like, the gameplay.

160
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:05,410
Like, I was like, I was like, bro, what the fuck is, like, how?

161
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,770
Like, bro, like, bro, bro, I don't understand how bro, bro couldn't do anything.

162
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,610
And then Espen was doing, like, insane shit, too.

163
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,270
He was doing, like, perfect parries and all that.

164
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,490
With the lag, by the way.

165
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,030
I was very surprised when they found out it was, there was lag.

166
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,370
I was like, how the fuck did he, when I found out the match he had was lag, I was like, how the fuck did he do that?

167
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,290
Perfect parry, that's insane.

168
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,110
That was insane, doing that perfect parry with the lag.

169
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:46,010
That meant he, like, he, yeah, that was so impressive, realizing that game was the lag game.

170
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,490
Um, he was predicting the fucking future.

171
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,310
Um.

172
00:16:50,310 --> 00:17:06,230
Uh, anyway, but, uh, and then I watched his last round, the, the last round, um, he was just, yeah, I watched the last round after realizing, I was like, oh my god, holy shit, what happened?

173
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:17,510
And then after that, I just kept walking, I walked to the, and then, like, I watched a little bit of Ko's match, um, obviously, I was still walking to the bank, and then I didn't watch, I'm so sorry, Brian, I didn't watch the coach's match, cause, like,

174
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,290
um, I was, like, I get very angry.

175
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:21,890
I'm scared to be the next one, I was so nervous.

176
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,190
I get incredibly anxious, even though I'm not there, I get incredibly anxious.

177
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:36,110
And I was like, oh my god, like, I know, like, uh, Brian had, like, a lot going in, too, uhh, it's, it's just very stressful, and I was like, I gotta go to the bank.

178
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,430
Like, I was like...

179
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:44,730
And I don't wanna watch, uh, I don't wanna watch Rasheed matchup, cause, like, um, Rasheed makes me mad.

180
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,170
Hahahahahahahahaha.

181
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,470
Hahahahahahahahaha.

182
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:48,690
Hahahahahahahaha.

183
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,500
Rat � tirar ikentμadh.

184
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,020
So I was like...

185
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,020
I was like, I'm sorry I didn't watch it.

186
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,120
I was just... I knew that matchup was going to be so stressful and anxious.

187
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,340
Anyway, so I got to the bank and literally the moment I got there, the bank was closed.

188
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,340
It was one minute after closing time.

189
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,380
It was... I was... and I was like... and then my friend messaged me and was like, Brian lost.

190
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,920
I was like... I was like, no!

191
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,300
I can't go break

192
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,870
it!

193
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,090
I literally got there and I was like, wait, is it closed?

194
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,950
And then it was like... and I looked and I was like, what time is it?

195
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,950
And it was like literally one minute after... after the closing.

196
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,310
Like it was...

197
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,070
It was one minute after closing and then I got to

198
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,730
tell me that Rasheed won!

199
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,430
I was so sad.

200
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,410
I was like... I was like, why?

201
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,830
Anyway, so I did all that for fucking nothing.

202
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,450
I literally was like, time to be a protective member of society and like do my banking stuff.

203
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,650
Anyway, so I walked back.

204
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:46,270
I walked back and then I was like, well, may as well get some groceries now that... now that I walked all the way here.

205
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,630
There is a grocery store on the walk back.

206
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:57,330
And then instead I saw a coffee shop first and I was just like, I'm going to get coffee first.

207
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,690
And then I'll go to the grocery store.

208
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,870
And then instead I just got... got like a drink.

209
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,710
I didn't get coffee.

210
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,350
I got a drink.

211
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,450
I got like... I got lemonade because I was like, I went to a coffee shop and got lemonade because I didn't really...

212
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,830
I didn't really want to drink coffee today.

213
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,610
So I was like, oh, they have lemonade, ice cold lemonade.

214
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,790
So I did... and then I was just like, I sat down.

215
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,590
Look, it was like... I was walking past it.

216
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,170
And it was a nice coffee shop, which I didn't get coffee for.

217
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:32,010
And then... so I just sat there just drinking my lemonade for like 20 minutes.

218
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:40,350
I sat in the... I sat in the coffee shop for like 20 minutes because I was just like, my life fucking sucks.

219
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,450
I was like... I was like, the bank closed.

220
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,530
I had to get bad news right after.

221
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,630
I walked this far for nothing.

222
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,410
And then I just sat on those like booth... not even a booth, like those like high chairs.

223
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,010
And just looked out the window and on my phone.

224
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,050
I was just looking at my phone and out the window drinking my lemonade.

225
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,590
I was just like, oh my God, I don't want to walk back.

226
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,210
I was like...

227
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,150
So I sat there for 20 minutes.

228
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,290
And then I walked back home without doing the groceries.

229
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,490
Because I realized...

230
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,250
Oh, fuck.

231
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,390
I have to go back home so I can walk my dog and then go stream.

232
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,730
It doesn't matter.

233
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,110
You can do most banking things online.

234
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,070
Not wire transfers in Canada.

235
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,390
Not the bank I use for wire.

236
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,410
I had to get... do a wire transferring cat like to somebody.

237
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,890
So like...

238
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,730
So like I couldn't.

239
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,870
So and I was like, I couldn't even get groceries.

240
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,690
Because I could have just walked my dog.

241
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,230
Instead of going to the bank.

242
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,910
So anyway, I was like, oh, fuck.

243
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,310
I need to go back so I can get back in time to walk my dog.

244
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,350
And then...

245
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,310
And then I have to walk all the way back home.

246
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,390
Really far from home, by the way.

247
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,130
And...

248
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,810
And then...

249
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,830
And then we walked.

250
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,350
We walked.

251
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,670
Okay.

252
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,410
And then guys, I did a crime today.

253
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,510
Guys.

254
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,770
I did a fucking crime.

255
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,270
I did a fucking crime today.

256
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,030
I walked dad.

257
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,130
Doki Amber Doge.

258
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,810
And then I was...

259
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,930
I was walking to him...

260
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,610
To the area.

261
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,430
I realized...

262
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,750
I ran out of doggy bags.

263
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,330
And then I was...

264
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,890
I was like...

265
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,190
I don't want to walk...

266
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,750
I don't want it so far.

267
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,250
I don't want to walk back just to get doggy bags.

268
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,010
I was gonna...

269
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,290
I

270
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,470
don't want to, guys.

271
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,790
I...

272
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,210
There was no other pet owner.

273
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,530
There was no...

274
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:20,710
I was...

275
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,530
I literally waited.

276
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,630
I literally waited five minutes next to the scene of the crime.

277
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,230
Waiting for a pet owner to just walk by me.

278
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,830
But nobody...

279
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,830
No pet owners walked by me.

280
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,010
So...

281
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,650
And I was like...

282
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,250
Nobody's here.

283
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,290
So then I walked home.

284
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,370
I...

285
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:44,990
Guys.

286
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,330
If that poop is...

287
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,400
I will pick it up.

288
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,260
If it...

289
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,920
If it's by there tomorrow, I'll pick it up.

290
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,360
Okay?

291
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,220
I swear.

292
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,180
I...

293
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,900
I swear.

294
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,420
It's...

295
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,240
Nobody's here.

296
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,160
Nobody saw it.

297
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,360
It's exactly...

298
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,040
Nobody was around me.

299
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:08,980
Okay.

300
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,180
This is like my...

301
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,420
It's like me going to confessional at a priest and be like...

302
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,580
You guys are like...

303
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,960
Guys, you're not supposed to rat me out.

304
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,320
This is my confession.

305
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,080
This is my confessional, guys.

306
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,720
Hello, Father, for I have sinned.

307
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,720
I left the dog poop out on the grass.

308
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,300
And then you guys are supposed to forgive me.

309
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,340
You guys are supposed to forgive me.

310
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm kidding.

311
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,220
I'm kidding.

312
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,160
There has to be at least one certified priest here.

313
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,220
Are there any priests that watch me?

314
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,420
I need a father to forgive me.

315
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,460
So things will be okay.

316
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,520
Anyway.

317
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,680
So yeah.

318
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,820
And then I...

319
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,500
You know, I came back upstairs and...

320
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,980
And then we had another incident with a man for dad.

321
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,260
He was very happy because there was a very pretty lady next to him.

322
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,680
And he was so happy because he was like, pretty lady!

323
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,300
And then the man that was also in the elevator was like, hello doggo!

324
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,760
And waved at my dog.

325
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,620
And then he was like...

326
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,840
I was like, what?!

327
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,400
I was like, you like the pretty lady!

328
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,200
He let the pretty lady pet him in front of that man.

329
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,480
And then the man just waved at him.

330
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,540
And he was like, that is a threat.

331
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,800
He was like, is that a fucking threat to the man?

332
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm like, I'm so sorry.

333
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm so sorry.

334
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,960
Anyway...

335
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,500
I told you, I had excuses ready for being late.

336
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,100
And that was why...

337
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,000
I was late to the stream today.

338
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,000
That is why I was late.

339
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,580
I told you, it was a very good excuse.

340
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,320
I told you guys, it was a very good excuse as to why I was late.

341
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,480
Anyway...

342
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,860
More Wukong.

343
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,660
More Wukong today.

344
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,280
I hope you guys enjoyed my life update.

345
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm gonna go get water.

346
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,560
Clip crime and everything.

347
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,500
I'll be right back.

348
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,020
I'm gonna get water real quick.

349
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm back.

350
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,100
I told you guys it was a good excuse.

351
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,940
Let's see.

352
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,280
I gotta make sure...

353
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,110
I still can't believe the odds.

354
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,450
That's so fucked for my friend to do that to me.

355
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,850
I need like 20 minutes out of the fucking coffee shop to be better.

356
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,690
Alright.

357
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,690
Continue journey.

358
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,750
Alright.

359
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,730
Guys, it's okay.

360
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,750
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

361
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,590
If it's still there, I'll pick it up tomorrow.

362
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,750
I swear to God, guys.

363
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,310
I swear.

364
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,790
I swear to God.

365
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,790
Like, it will be picked up if it's still there.

366
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,510
Alright.

367
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,790
No.

368
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,670
Yes, I will.

369
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,230
Yes, I will.

370
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,770
You guys don't know that.

371
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,570
Guess you won't even know if I did or not.

372
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,770
I could literally just say I...

373
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,590
I could just pretend I picked it up.

374
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,670
But I won't because I'm not a fucking criminal.

375
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,190
It was like...

376
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,230
It's an IOU.

377
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,090
I'm not a criminal.

378
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,990
I would never actually do that, guys.

379
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,230
I'm not a fucking criminal.

380
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,790
Okay.

381
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,230
Let me make sure everything is...

382
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,070
Uhh...

383
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,350
I'm lucky.

384
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,790
So, thank you for the super chat.

385
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,170
Thank you.

386
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:52,710
Thank you.

387
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,750
Young lost child.

388
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,250
In order to repent your sin, you must go and fix that which you have wrong.

389
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,750
Apologize to the grass and the bugs for leaving the sin.

390
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,410
The bugs love it.

391
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,030
Like, okay, you can't say it's a sin if the...

392
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,190
if the bugs love it.

393
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,210
It's like natural and it's...

394
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,430
and like dog poop is like natural fertilizer.

395
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,250
It's literally...

396
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,830
It's literally fertilizer.

397
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,210
It's...

398
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,690
Yes, I do.

399
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,350
That's what fertilizer is.

400
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,390
Fertilizer is literally animal shit.

401
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,550
You think I don't know that?

402
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,370
That's literally what fertilizer is!

403
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,430
But I'll pick it up tomorrow.

404
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,370
This is the first time I've ever done this, guys.

405
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,310
This is literally the first time.

406
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,750
I was going through so much, guys.

407
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,270
The bank was closed, okay?

408
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,270
I was so shook up by that.

409
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,670
This is literally the first time.

410
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,530
Um...

411
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,130
Let's see...

412
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,530
Alright, let's see.

413
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,970
I don't need that.

414
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,770
I feel like refreshing taste seems better.

415
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:26,790
Three?

416
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,410
Really?

417
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,990
Do we really need more health?

418
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,470
Do we really?

419
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,990
One or three, guys?

420
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,470
One or three.

421
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,370
Don't keep or deprive the environment by removing fertilizer.

422
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,390
Thank you for the super chat.

423
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,170
Thank you, thank you.

424
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,450
Alright, we'll get three then.

425
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,910
We'll get more HP.

426
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,990
What else am I using?

427
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,170
Immobilize?

428
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:02,950
I am.

429
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:03,990
Okay.

430
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,690
Is spellbinder good for this level or should I keep the immobilize?

431
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:07,950
What is this chat?

432
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,590
What do you say?

433
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,010
Am I going to just upgrade the immobilize stuff?

434
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,730
Is there anything else I'm missing?

435
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,430
Is big baby still...

436
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,150
Big baby is still my G.

437
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,870
It's my bro.

438
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,630
Uh...

439
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,350
Increases when health is low.

440
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,570
No, I still... I like the stuff I have now.

441
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,070
Uh...

442
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,490
Oh...

443
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,630
Look at all the stuff I...

444
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,870
Look at everything I hoarded.

445
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,230
Look at...

446
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,650
Look at...

447
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,990
Guys, this will save me on the...

448
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,650
Guys, I'm hoarding all of this for the last boss fight.

449
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,390
You guys don't understand.

450
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,690
This shit is going to save me, guys.

451
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,690
Look at all these items.

452
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,370
Guys, you don't understand.

453
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,410
This shit is going to...

454
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,410
It's going to go wild.

455
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,150
This is your start of darkness.

456
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,410
Next, you'll be leaving cats and trees.

457
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,670
Thank you for the super chat.

458
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,630
Thank you, thank you.

459
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,850
Where do I go?

460
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,050
Oh, shit.

461
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,010
It's okay.

462
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,270
Like, what is he going to do?

463
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,730
Fucking kill me?

464
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,010
That's fucking right.

465
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,290
No, you don't touch me.

466
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,810
Alright, let's go.

467
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,410
I guess we'll go this way.

468
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,430
Guys, I'm waiting for the DLC.

469
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,990
Wait, why is he over here?

470
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,070
Oh, shit.

471
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,890
Was I supposed to...

472
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,290
Oh, wait.

473
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,210
Are you a good guy?

474
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,310
Oh, you're...

475
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:41,050
I didn't realize I was in a fucking silver war.

476
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,070
What is this?

477
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,350
I'm just going to gather this.

478
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,590
Am I supposed to...

479
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,890
Am I supposed to be here?

480
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,110
I can't tell.

481
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,850
Am I even supposed to be here?

482
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,850
Oh, okay.

483
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,170
I couldn't tell.

484
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,770
Like...

485
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,730
Okay.

486
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,830
I can get through this.

487
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,870
Yeah, we'll be fine.

488
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,410
Oh, shit!

489
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,470
Wait, I'm just going to let them fight each other first.

490
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,550
Right?

491
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,090
If they fight each other, then I can...

492
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,250
Wait, that guy is doing nothing.

493
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,570
He's actually doing like...

494
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,170
Is it him?

495
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,870
Doing zero damage.

496
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,370
I assume it's...

497
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,330
Oh, yeah, it is him.

498
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,370
Yeah, yeah, it is him.

499
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:29,730
Okay.

500
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,190
Okay, I was like wondering who the fuck is...

501
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,030
Are you the one that I'm supposed to fight?

502
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,570
Like, get up!

503
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:39,850
Alright.

504
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,050
I'm going to heal real fast.

505
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,850
I know, like, I don't really need to heal.

506
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,650
But, like, I just want to heal.

507
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,250
Wait, I could just...

508
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,430
That's right.

509
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,650
I'm dragging in time.

510
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,870
Third party.

511
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,790
How do I, like, get the meter up?

512
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,650
The circles up?

513
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,610
Oh, shit!

514
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,290
Okay, don't worry.

515
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,590
Don't worry.

516
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,130
We're fine.

517
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,510
We're fine.

518
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,790
I don't know how to get the...

519
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,230
the power up.

520
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,850
Okay.

521
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,570
Charges in and execute a beta...

522
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,310
How?

523
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,790
How?

524
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,150
Oh, building up!

525
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,490
Oh!

526
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,070
Bottom line attack by heavy attack!

527
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,170
Oh, okay!

528
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,270
Okay, I figured it out.

529
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,670
Guys.

530
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,030
I figured it out.

531
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,670
Did I?

532
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,410
Wait, it's still not going up.

533
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,430
Hahaha!

534
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,710
Guys, I...

535
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,370
I don't know how to do it.

536
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,510
I don't know!

537
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:38,910
I...

538
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,710
I still don't know.

539
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,750
Wait, what?

540
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,970
Is he dead?

541
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,450
What?

542
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:44,990
Hello?

543
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,330
Friend?

544
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,850
Wait, are you friend?

545
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,010
Wait, you're friend?

546
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,290
Oh, I need a countdown.

547
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,250
All right...

548
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,410
Oh, I need a Oh, the Oh, the Bow King.

549
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,190
I know him.

550
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,510
Yeah, ...

551
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,610
...

552
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,250
Yeah!

553
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,770
He was actually friend-shaped!

554
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,850
It was hard to tell when his eyes started glowing red.

555
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,270
Hey,

556
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,630
hey, hey.

557
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,590
Can you help me?

558
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,430
What the fuck?

559
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,430
We're having a conversation!

560
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:46,990
What the... Where is this, like, the dialogue... the dialogue immunity?

561
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,750
But you can't just interrupt somebody while we're trying to talk!

562
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,090
The five element cards.

563
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,850
Okay.

564
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,710
Okay, I did not mean to drink, but okay.

565
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,530
I have a problem, but that's okay.

566
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,670
There's more to it.

567
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,750
What do you mean by that?

568
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:28,770
Alright.

569
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,590
That should be everything.

570
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,110
Alright, time to rob this grave!

571
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,350
My second favorite thing to do today.

572
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,630
After my crime.

573
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,470
The first one was my crime.

574
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,430
But, like, that's a joke, guys.

575
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,770
That was the first time I did this.

576
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,890
Did that, by the way.

577
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,490
Oh, wait, there's another grave.

578
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,490
What?

579
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,970
So many crimes.

580
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,450
Alright.

581
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,590
Yay!

582
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,910
Grave robbing!

583
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,790
I wonder if you can rob, like... guys, this is a joke.

584
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,370
This is hypothetical.

585
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,810
I don't really mean it.

586
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,230
But, like, you know how there's abandoned cemeteries?

587
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,350
I wonder, like, if you can... if they're abandoned, does that mean you can rob them?

588
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,610
Are you legally allowed to rob them?

589
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,470
Because they are abandoned, right?

590
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,710
I'm just, like, hypothetically.

591
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,750
I'm just wondering.

592
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,910
It's, like, a curiosity thing.

593
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,950
Like, that's what archaeology is.

594
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,610
Wait, you're right!

595
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,170
If enough time passes, you're legally allowed to grave rob.

596
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,250
And if you're British.

597
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,090
I'm sorry.

598
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,010
I'm sorry.

599
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,490
The British Museum is just very easy to make fun of.

600
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:40,770
No.

601
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:41,890
Oh, boy.

602
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:53,150
Yeah, archaeology is technically legal grave robbing if you think about it.

603
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,350
If you...

604
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,770
If you think about it, chat.

605
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,830
Like, that's what being an archaeologist is.

606
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,190
You dig up people's remains and be like, ah, yes.

607
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,750
History.

608
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,150
It belongs in a museum!

609
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:10,930
Exactly!

610
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,050
If Indiana Jones was, like, applauded for grave robbing...

611
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,670
I don't understand why it's wrong.

612
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,390
Now it's a billion-dollar company right there.

613
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,410
A billion-dollar franchise.

614
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,430
Oh, guys.

615
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,430
Now I understand why you guys said, like, I need...

616
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,730
I need fire resistance.

617
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,650
Now I understand.

618
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,230
Now!

619
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,010
Whoa!

620
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:30,750
Now...

621
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,470
Whoa!

622
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,670
Now I...

623
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,750
Now I realize why!

624
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,250
Whoa!

625
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,130
Okay, that's fine.

626
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,790
Okay.

627
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:46,990
Nice.

628
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,510
Okay.

629
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,310
Oh, that's fine!

630
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:52,890
That's fine!

631
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,730
That's fine!

632
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,230
That's fine!

633
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,430
Yeah it's a...

634
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:02,990
Exactly!

635
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,050
I don't understand what's wrong with...

636
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,170
OH!

637
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,050
SHIT!

638
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,590
Am I... am I even supposed to be here?

639
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:18,250
I feel like this is not the right way to punish this man.

640
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:23,770
I feel like I might be fighting this guy incorrectly.

641
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,330
It's just a feeling.

642
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,950
I don't know...

643
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,490
Okay.

644
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,070
Alright, that's fine.

645
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,130
Alright, we're fine.

646
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,210
What is he gonna do?

647
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,750
He can't do jack shit.

648
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,030
I'm literally like...

649
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,730
Yeah!

650
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,510
That's right.

651
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,650
That's right, the Dark Souls role.

652
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,670
Nice, okay.

653
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,950
Oh, I'm actually supposed to fight like this?

654
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,810
That's so sad.

655
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,190
That's so sad for him.

656
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,690
Like, what the fuck is this boss fight?

657
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,210
Why is this...

658
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,030
Why is this...

659
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,710
This stupid boss fight?

660
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,530
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

661
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,250
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that.

662
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,110
I didn't mean that.

663
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,170
I did do the Dark Souls role.

664
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,210
I'm so sorry.

665
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:19,610
Stop!

666
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,250
I'm so sorry.

667
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,330
You're not easy.

668
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,390
You're not easy.

669
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,170
You're very...

670
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,230
You're very hard to get.

671
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,950
You're very hard to get.

672
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,470
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,870
Alright, we did it.

674
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,630
It was so fucking easy.

675
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,290
Alright.

676
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,850
There we go.

677
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,750
Easy.

678
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,950
Easiest fight of my fucking life.

679
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,170
Okay, we gotta rest.

680
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,050
We gotta...

681
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,990
We gotta make sure everything is okay.

682
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,490
Alright.

683
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,270
You are very valid.

684
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,870
You're not easy.

685
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,110
You don't...

686
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,870
You're not that...

687
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,610
You're not that easy to fight.

688
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:05,910
Okay?

689
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,830
You're so valid.

690
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,250
Like, everybody always makes...

691
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,090
makes guide...

692
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,230
video and YouTube videos on how to beat you.

693
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,970
That's how hard you are.

694
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,230
Alright, nice.

695
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,390
Exactly.

696
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,070
Imagine needing fire resistance.

697
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,030
Come on.

698
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,610
Fire resistance are for pussies.

699
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,170
I beat that guy with zero fire resistance.

700
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,150
Oh fuck!

701
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,830
I'm so...

702
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,450
What?

703
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,430
He was dead!

704
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,790
Guys, I still don't need it.

705
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,070
Guys, I still don't need fire resistance, guys.

706
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,910
Like, this does not prove anybody's point.

707
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,850
I'm just gonna say.

708
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,790
That doesn't prove any...

709
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,610
That doesn't prove anybody's point.

710
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,170
I still don't need it.

711
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,410
It was just unlucky.

712
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,890
All right.

713
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,870
That was just incredible.

714
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,690
How was I supposed to know they explode?

715
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,330
Who's still...

716
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,730
We don't need fire resistance.

717
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:15,910
All right.

718
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,310
Nice.

719
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,290
We're still fine.

720
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,730
Are you sure about that?

721
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,830
It was just one mistake.

722
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,810
Just like how I committed only one crime.

723
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,550
Of which, uh, I'm pretty sure a dragoon priest has forgiven me for.

724
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:30,770
Okay.

725
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,450
Okay.

726
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:31,470
Okay.

727
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:31,530
Okay.

728
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:31,950
Okay.

729
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,170
This way.

730
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:36,130
Yeah.

731
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,850
Why need fire resistance if I can just heal?

732
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,130
Exactly.

733
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,490
He knows what's up.

734
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,450
All right.

735
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:45,830
Nice.

736
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,390
Okay.

737
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:47,970
What if I...

738
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,330
Oh!

739
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:48,890
Shit!

740
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,210
That's fine.

741
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:51,590
Poke!

742
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,770
Like, what is he gonna do?

743
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,530
Fucking...

744
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,110
Look!

745
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,190
Look how little the fire does!

746
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,050
Look how little it does!

747
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,490
See?

748
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,570
It does nothing.

749
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:01,690
Exactly.

750
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,950
Okay.

751
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,570
I swear to God.

752
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,370
If you explode too...

753
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:03,510
Okay.

754
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,330
He just ragdolls.

755
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,150
That's good.

756
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,430
All right.

757
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:06,830
What is he?

758
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,470
He's a bat.

759
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,370
A lava bat!

760
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,130
Okay.

761
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,130
I mean, that makes sense.

762
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,630
I must have a priest here that watches me.

763
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,310
I mean, it might be a little weird that you watch me, but...

764
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:26,790
But as long as you go to confession afterwards, you know, it'll be fine.

765
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,110
He'll understand.

766
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,830
I mean, what is he gonna do?

767
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,010
Look!

768
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,770
Fire abilities!

769
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,310
Ow!

770
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,090
Oh!

771
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,010
His entire axe is fire!

772
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:36,950
Okay!

773
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,590
I'm sorry!

774
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,690
Oh!

775
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,650
Never mind!

776
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,830
His entire axe is just fire!

777
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:44,510
Okay!

778
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,370
Jesus Christ!

779
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:46,850
Okay.

780
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:47,490
That's fine.

781
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:48,570
That's fine.

782
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,050
We're gonna get rid of the bow guy first.

783
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,810
We're gonna get rid of him.

784
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:54,270
Okay.

785
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,090
Nice.

786
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:55,630
Fine.

787
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,050
I told you.

788
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,650
I am watching Doki.

789
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,550
It's so sad.

790
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,950
I'll gladly be a superhero.

791
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:02,150
Thank you.

792
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,390
Listener.

793
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,990
Nexie, thank you for the super chat.

794
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:05,590
Thank you.

795
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,190
Thank you.

796
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,010
All right.

797
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:08,970
Oh, we get to meditate!

798
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:24,520
I can't believe the bank was closed and I can't even go there tomorrow because it's a fucking holiday for banks.

799
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,000
What kind of cruel world is this?

800
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,420
Why do people need to take holidays?

801
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,240
I don't have a holiday.

802
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,380
I'm fucking working 24 seven.

803
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:49,280
Of course, I don't- not dragoons though.

804
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,480
Dragoons are exempt for that.

805
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,240
Dragoons, you guys deserve the holiday.

806
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,060
Toki, Sunday is the Lord's Day.

807
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,740
Alright, let's see.

808
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,840
We go this way.

809
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,360
Here is a small investment for the bank.

810
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,920
Thank you for the super chat.

811
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,160
Thank you, thank you.

812
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,460
Asian Mafia, thank you for the super chat.

813
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,480
Thank you, thank you.

814
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,140
Oh my god, finally, more cold iron leaves.

815
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,160
My fucking favorite.

816
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,040
Hey Toki, it's my birthday tomorrow.

817
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,140
Mind if I ask you for a stream?

818
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,360
Yes, I will be doing a sponsored watchalike.

819
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,800
For a VTuber debut tomorrow.

820
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:46,280
But I wish you a happy birthday today because I think it would be a little awkward to sing happy birthday on a sponsored stream.

821
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,620
They paid for me to watch one of their debuts.

822
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,740
I won't be watching all of them because my rates are high.

823
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,400
I mean, if you want to be truthful.

824
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,120
I like it.

825
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,920
I like it.

826
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,240
People are like wondering, oh, why aren't you watching the other ones?

827
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,680
Happy birthday to you.

828
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,760
Happy birthday to you.

829
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,160
Happy birthday.

830
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,100
Future birthday to Asian Mafia.

831
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Happy birthday to you.

832
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,200
Yay!

833
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,940
Happy birthday.

834
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:26,800
I'm not going to lie.

835
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,360
This is why.

836
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,220
I mean, this is the truth.

837
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,480
It is what it is.

838
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,140
Also, they honestly.

839
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,300
Honestly, I shouldn't be paying that much.

840
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,440
So much.

841
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,000
I feel bad.

842
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,780
I want them to invest in their talents.

843
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,080
So I'm glad they only paid for one.

844
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,620
Let's see.

845
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,680
Which way?

846
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,160
Wait.

847
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,620
Wait, how do I get across there?

848
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,660
How do I get across there?

849
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,580
Yeah, and I'm raiding their next debut too.

850
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,580
So, um, it's a win-win.

851
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,510
Uh, we go...

852
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,230
Where do we go?

853
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,140
Where the fuck do I go?

854
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:30,550
Yay!

855
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,170
I've actually done that before.

856
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:49,550
I had like some VTuber companies asking to pay a lot to watch, like, all their debuts and stuff, and then I rejected it because I was like, oh, I want you to invest in the talents instead.

857
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,830
I'll be like, okay, I can do, like, one.

858
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:53,750
Like...

859
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:57,070
Yeah.

860
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,770
I had, like, lots of offers to do watch-alongs.

861
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,070
I pick and choose for those.

862
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:08,410
But also more so when I see, like, the company, I'd be like, no, invest in the talents.

863
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:18,370
Like, don't... I don't want you going to watch all of them because I feel like that money would be better spent on just making sure the talents are invested properly.

864
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,330
Woo!

865
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:38,880
Because I feel like, you know, because also I don't want to undercharge myself because I know what my rates are, but, like, because I know, like, I can be like, oh, just give them, like, uh...

866
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,200
Uh...

867
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,360
Oh, is that...

868
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,320
Shit, this guy's... this guy's very annoying.

869
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:54,660
But I don't want to undercharge myself, too, because I know my own worth, but also, like, I'd rather see, like, talents get more of that money.

870
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:13,980
Yeah, investing in publicity is considered investing in the talents, but that's why I... sometimes I agree to do, like, one of the... that's why I agree to do, like, one of the debuts instead of, like, uh... not, like, for the current sponsor, but more so,

871
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:22,300
like, like, any sponsor... sponsors that ask me to do watch-alongs for VTubers, I would usually just go for one debut instead of, like, uh...

872
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,600
instead of, like, uh... the whole thing.

873
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,800
So that I can rate into it, and then if some guys might stick around for the other talents, then, like, that's a win for them.

874
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,820
And then, uh...

875
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,980
they don't have to spend all that money on me.

876
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,940
I think it was here.

877
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:41,880
I think it was here.

878
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:41,900
Yeah.

879
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:45,880
Woo!

880
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:48,620
Okay.

881
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,300
Yeah, I'm taking more sponsors, too.

882
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,200
Yeah, I'm taking more sponsors, too.

883
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,000
Because I also have to pay bills.

884
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,560
That means I have to pay bills.

885
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,880
But, like, bills as in, like, lawyers and stuff, too.

886
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,520
For, like, uh...

887
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,000
For, like, the next new company in the finan- Oh!

888
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,800
The financial advisors!

889
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:15,140
Yay!

890
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:17,140
Nice.

891
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:17,620
Okay.

892
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,760
He didn't die.

893
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,680
Yeah, lawyers are very fucking expensive.

894
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,140
One of my- I realized that they charge for every email interaction, too.

895
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:39,080
Like- Like, I got a- I got a bill from one of my lawyers, and they're like, here's the bill.

896
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,760
They're like, alright.

897
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,560
Email- And I'm just like, alright.

898
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,260
Now I know!

899
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,440
Because, like, I didn't realize that.

900
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,060
And, like- And, like, I was like, um...

901
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:54,440
And I was like, okay, I'm gonna uh, I'll just give, like, short replies.

902
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,640
And then if I have another reply that I wanna do, I send another email.

903
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,300
And then I didn't realize she was charging for replies!

904
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,680
You

905
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,500
bitch!

906
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,000
I - I didn't know!

907
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,700
I- I was like, okay, I have this to say now.

908
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:27,820
And then I looked at, like, cause lawyers charge by monthly bill, not by, like, if you have a lawyer on retainer.

909
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,700
No, it's apparently a thing!

910
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,520
And, like, I never handled the lawyer stuff before, but, so, I was fucking stupid.

911
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,780
So fucking stupid.

912
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:46,100
Cause I, I'm both, like, my lawyers are all on retainer, so they work specifically for me.

913
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,320
Holy shit!

914
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,180
No!

915
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,020
Guys, it's not because I don't have fire resistance!

916
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,800
It's not because of that!

917
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,480
I was having a conversation!

918
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,540
Anyway...

919
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,520
Okay, okay, I didn't think I was gonna handle this all over again!

920
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,840
It was so far, too!

921
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,840
It was so far!

922
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,120
Oh my god!

923
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,900
Anyway...

924
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,360
Anyway, so now I know!

925
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,240
Now I know to not reply to, like, every...

926
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,540
Now I know!

927
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,460
I'm gonna fucking run through this like Darcels.

928
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,620
I can't do this again.

929
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,000
Now I know when I send an email reply.

930
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,180
When I send an email reply, I'm going to fucking...

931
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,400
I'm gonna make sure everything I wanna say is being said.

932
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,900
So I learned my lesson now.

933
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,500
Oh my god.

934
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,480
Leave me alone!

935
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,420
I shouldn't have died there.

936
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,920
Oh my god!

937
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,540
You don't even matter!

938
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,280
Your fucking mom doesn't even love you!

939
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,760
You're gonna die a fucking orphan if you find your mom!

940
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,500
Okay.

941
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,600
Alright.

942
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,560
Get over here.

943
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:17,660
Alright.

944
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,240
What about his dad?

945
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,160
You can tell he has no dad.

946
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,560
Okay, we're fine.

947
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,500
Alright.

948
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,940
Okay, what was I saying?

949
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,620
I don't even remember what I was saying, guys.

950
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,240
I like...

951
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,380
Oh, I legitimately forgot.

952
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,600
He just wants...

953
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,520
Oh yeah, the lawyer.

954
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,040
Oh yeah, so anyway, yeah.

955
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,980
So they charge for every...

956
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,720
Every fucking...

957
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,300
Every fucking email reply.

958
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,740
So a particular amount.

959
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,280
So now that I learned, now I know that I have to like...

960
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,040
Just be very direct with everything I do.

961
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,840
Haha!

962
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,380
Now I know.

963
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,100
Alright.

964
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,420
Alright, here we go.

965
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:14,840
Woo!

966
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,790
Let's go.

967
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,090
Get over here.

968
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,030
No!

969
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,670
It's okay, I'm not the one that's getting blamed right now.

970
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,230
So it's fine.

971
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,270
What the fuck charges for email replies?

972
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,550
Fucking lawyers apparently.

973
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:34,990
Lawyers do?

974
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,430
That's what I learned.

975
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,790
I will figure how... Oh shit.

976
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,750
Okay, that's fine.

977
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,010
These guys don't matter anyway.

978
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,110
Alright.

979
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,290
We're fine.

980
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,370
We're fine.

981
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:56,790
Yay!

982
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,530
No, it's just what...

983
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,030
Apparently that's normal.

984
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,910
Because both my lawyers do that.

985
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,690
You can pretend it's like a super chat.

986
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,550
But like I don't use them.

987
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:20,690
I just have to use...

988
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,970
It's not gonna be bad because it's like we're startup.

989
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:24,910
Like I'm a startup.

990
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:29,830
So like obviously I need to talk to my lawyer a lot regarding stuff too.

991
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:31,210
So like...

992
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:32,410
Oh shit!

993
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,290
Where did you come from?

994
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,290
So like obviously I have to do a lot of email exchanges and stuff.

995
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,390
But now it's cooling down a lot.

996
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:41,970
So I don't have to worry about it anymore.

997
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,710
I don't have to...

998
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:47,910
I don't have to worry about that anymore.

999
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:54,930
Get a lawyer to check if the lawyer fee is true.

1000
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,930
This is his home.

1001
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:00,790
It's my home now.

1002
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,730
This is Wukong territory.

1003
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,550
What happens if I do the incense right next to him?

1004
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:06,970
Yeah okay.

1005
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,110
At least I get the immortality here.

1006
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,030
Know your rates.

1007
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,770
Know your...

1008
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,510
If you're like a content creator.

1009
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:21,910
Research your rates.

1010
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,030
And like...

1011
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:25,510
For me I don't...

1012
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,690
Even though I don't undercharge myself.

1013
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:30,630
Like I don't...

1014
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,510
If it's like...

1015
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,290
Depending on the company.

1016
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:39,470
I only do it for a brand I really really really really want to work with.

1017
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,670
I will undercharge myself a little bit.

1018
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,170
But even then I don't...

1019
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,310
I stick with my rates.

1020
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,310
Extended duration of duplicates.

1021
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:53,810
Let's see.

1022
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,940
No pets?

1023
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,440
No they were willing to pay my rates.

1024
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,920
Alright.

1025
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,380
Nice.

1026
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,100
I won't say what it is though.

1027
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,300
I think I...

1028
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,660
I can't say what it is.

1029
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,460
I don't think I...

1030
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,360
I don't even know like legally I can.

1031
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,540
I know what other content creators make though.

1032
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,220
But like I'll do say...

1033
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,580
I do think like...

1034
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,020
I think that uh...

1035
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,340
Fleshies...

1036
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,520
Make more in general.

1037
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,680
Because they can...

1038
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,020
Have more...

1039
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,480
The way he has sponsors and at like...

1040
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,960
Branding wise...

1041
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,020
Is like a lot...

1042
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,960
Uh...

1043
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,820
What the fuck are you?

1044
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,780
You're so fucked...

1045
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,480
Are you naked?

1046
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Where's your dick?

1047
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,920
Sorry.

1048
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,900
Holy shit he's naked!

1049
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,460
Oh my god you can see his ass!

1050
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:04,820
Like...

1051
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,400
Like...

1052
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,140
You can't just be like...

1053
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,540
Where's he holding?

1054
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,360
What the fuck are you...

1055
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,260
Oh shit it's me too!

1056
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,460
Okay children let's go.

1057
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,220
Like what is he holding?

1058
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,860
Is that like his...

1059
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,900
Son?

1060
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:18,800
Dead son?

1061
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,260
He's naked!

1062
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,660
It is a...

1063
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,040
Honestly it is a...

1064
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,540
It is a good question to ask.

1065
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,400
Alright.

1066
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,900
Father of stones.

1067
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,840
This is children.

1068
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,040
Oh my god that was easy.

1069
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:37,820
The fuck?

1070
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,500
He hurts me?

1071
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,300
I could have actually died there.

1072
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,620
But he was pretty weak not gonna lie.

1073
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,570
Don't look!

1074
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:53,310
Don't look!

1075
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,650
I was curious!

1076
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,530
Like why...

1077
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,670
I just wanted to know why he was naked!

1078
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,550
But like cause like I compared...

1079
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,330
My rates...

1080
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,330
To like other...

1081
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,490

1082
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,310
Has to kill him and complain...

1083
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,550

1084
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,290
Can't believe he's naked...

1085
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,250
In his own home.

1086
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,450
Where do I go?

1087
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:26,650
Um...

1088
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,310
I could go either way.

1089
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:28,950
I'll go this way.

1090
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,970
Thank you Super Chat Burrito.

1091
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,050
Thank you, thank you.

1092
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,670
But like I compared what my rates are...

1093
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,910
To somebody that was like...

1094
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,910
Close to my like...

1095
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:39,630
CCV.

1096
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,070
Cause like I was like you know...

1097
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:43,730
Is that a child?

1098
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,790
I don't trust children.

1099
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,710
I will never trust children again!

1100
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,010
Hahaha!

1101
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,530
I will never fucking trust children!

1102
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,050
After what they did to me!

1103
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,950
They baited me into a well!

1104
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,050
To make me fight!

1105
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,090
Fucking...

1106
00:59:59,090 --> 00:59:59,790
Uh...

1107
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,030
What the fuck?

1108
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:07,130
OH MY GOD IS THAT YOU?!

1109
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:07,910
IT MUST BE YOU!

1110
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,130
YOU FUCKING CHILD!

1111
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,170
I KNEW IT!

1112
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,590
Wait I need to absorb this.

1113
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,290
Grey bronze cart.

1114
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,830
It's always the children.

1115
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,530
I goddamn knew the children were in on this.

1116
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,150
I knew it.

1117
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,410
Never trust a child.

1118
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,630
NEVER TRUST A CHILD!

1119
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:29,900
Alright.

1120
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,260
Woooo!

1121
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,800
Oh hey guys.

1122
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,780
Are you guys praying?

1123
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,640
Am I interrupting something?

1124
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,820
Oh I like how like when you're in a tight corridor...

1125
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,280
You don't even...

1126
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,420
Uh...

1127
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,580
You don't even like...

1128
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,960
Stand on your stick.

1129
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,860
You just stand there and be like...

1130
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:51,000
Hi.

1131
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,680
I don't even know where I'm going.

1132
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,520
This is a maze.

1133
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,500
No this is a maze.

1134
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,080
This is not...

1135
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,440
This is not good.

1136
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,060
I already get lost...

1137
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:01,920
In non-maze scenarios.

1138
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,380
Oh no.

1139
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,360
Oh no!

1140
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,600
Nooooo!

1141
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,560
What is this?

1142
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,940
I already have...

1143
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,720
Issues with non-mazes!

1144
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,520
This is bad.

1145
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,300
That's fine.

1146
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,280
This guy is weak as fuck.

1147
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,190
Sorry.

1148
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,990
I didn't mean that.

1149
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,750
Oh my god you're not weak.

1150
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:35,470
I'm sorry.

1151
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,050
Oh shit.

1152
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,330
Oh I didn't mean it.

1153
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,270
Sir I didn't mean to say you're weak.

1154
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,010
Lowkey he is though.

1155
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,430
Are you serious?

1156
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,430
Oh fuck.

1157
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,870
That's fine.

1158
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:54,490
We're fine.

1159
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:55,510
We're fine.

1160
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,050
We're so healthy.

1161
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,170
We're so healthy.

1162
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:00,810
Alright.

1163
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:01,290
Nice.

1164
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:04,190
Wow!

1165
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,830
That's fine.

1166
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,230
We're fine.

1167
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:06,910
We're so fine.

1168
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:07,450
Wait.

1169
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:08,450
When did I kill him?

1170
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:09,390
Oh nice.

1171
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,590
Our Dark Souls rolled it.

1172
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,030
Okay.

1173
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:14,950
Nice.

1174
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:15,250
Alright.

1175
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:15,890
We're okay.

1176
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,110
Yay!

1177
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,350
I can absorb him.

1178
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,570
We don't need fire resistance.

1179
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,230
We're stronger than that.

1180
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:25,470
Guys.

1181
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,190
Like look at me.

1182
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,460
We're so strong.

1183
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:35,920
We're so strong.

1184
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,200
We're so strong.

1185
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,940
Let's see.

1186
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,200
This way.

1187
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,160
Yay!

1188
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,540
What was I saying?

1189
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:49,880
Oh yeah.

1190
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:54,800
I compared myself with a fleshy tuber that has like similar CCV as me.

1191
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,320
Cause I didn't really know what my rates were in general when I first started out.

1192
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,460
So I lowballed it.

1193
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,220
I remembered.

1194
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,700
Especially for conventions.

1195
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,080
I like lowballed so fucking hard for conventions.

1196
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,480
Cause I didn't know what my rates were.

1197
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,680
At all.

1198
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,940
I was like I don't know what to charge.

1199
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:29,140
And then I remembered like The person I was working with When I got somebody to work on conventions for me They literally were like They were like Oh my god you charge so fucking cheap.

1200
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:36,020
They were like They were like Don't No don't do that.

1201
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:45,160
So I gradually I gradually Like Raised my rates like Over time.

1202
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,240
I'm happy with where it's at now.

1203
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,240
I missed the soul.

1204
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,720
But there was no soul here.

1205
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,560
There's no soul here.

1206
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,480
It's in the wall.

1207
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,380
They're in your walls.

1208
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,300
Oh my god it was in the wall.

1209
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,540
It was literally in the wall.

1210
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,760
Cause someone was like you missed the soul.

1211
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,640
And I was like what?

1212
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,680
They're in your walls.

1213
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,700
Yeah so I'm happy with where it's at now.

1214
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,020
Cause I know like what my worth is.

1215
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:25,540
Woooo Apparently They say this chapter is like Really short Compared to the other.

1216
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,180
Oh my god.

1217
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,060
I don't like that.

1218
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,480
They're like souls on the walls.

1219
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,020
They're so creepy.

1220
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,920
That's so creepy actually.

1221
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,840
This is what happens when you join the tomato farm.

1222
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,200
I'm keeping you guys in the walls.

1223
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,860

I can do it again.

1227
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,520

1228
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,560

Look at that.

1234
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:08,880

1241
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,380
No need for fire resistance chat.

1242
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,540
Oh I really need mana.

1243
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,260
Holy shit.

1244
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,160
Guys I don't have any mana at all.

1245
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,560
Holy fuck.

1246
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,240
This is bad.

1247
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,800
I sort of relied on the magic too.

1248
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,400
Alright.

1249
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:50,800
Nice.

1250
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:52,520
It's fine.

1251
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,520
We're half way there.

1252
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,140
See?

1253
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,200
No need.

1254
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,820
No need for...

1255
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,080
Oh and I can do this too.

1256
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,760
I can use big baby.

1257
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,520
That's fucking right.

1258
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,540
Who said I needed to use fucking fire resistance.

1259
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,800
I can kill great bronze car without it.

1260
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,660
That's fucking right.

1261
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,160
Oh my god.

1262
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,140
I can still do this.

1263
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,720
No.

1264
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,400
Oh my god.

1265
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,120
I can still do this.

1266
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,620
I told you.

1267
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,980
I told you guys.

1268
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,040
Nothing is impossible.

1269
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,860
I told you guys.

1270
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,240
Nothing is impossible.

1271
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,180
Who is this?

1272
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:41,280
Who is this?

1273
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,880
Kai Monkey?

1274
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,260
Who the fuck are you child?

1275
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,860
I don't trust children.

1276
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,660
Is that a tadpole?

1277
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,880
Oh that's a fox.

1278
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,300
You know what?

1279
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,760
She's not saying Kai Monkey.

1280
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,140
She's saying good brother.

1281
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,360
Three days?

1282
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,540
How did you drink?

1283
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,240
Good brother.

1284
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,140
Good brother.

1285
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:32,480
Oh I don't have.

1286
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,000
What?

1287
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,800
I don't have a shrine.

1288
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,460
Oh this is so bad.

1289
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,620
This is so bad.

1290
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,340
I have no.

1291
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,400
I don't have magic.

1292
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,520
I don't have magic.

1293
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,660
I didn't know.

1294
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,280
What is another bot?

1295
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,220
It's the bot.

1296
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,440
Oh fuck.

1297
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,260
Okay.

1298
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,120
Oh shit.

1299
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,280
This is so.

1300
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,890
Okay one stone.

1301
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:06,290
Okay this is fine.

1302
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,270
We will be fine.

1303
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,110
We will be okay.

1304
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,530
Oh it's so over.

1305
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:14,970
We have zero magic guys.

1306
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,870
Thank god.

1307
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,130
Oh no.

1308
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:18,290
Oh no.

1309
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,090
This is so bad.

1310
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:21,950
No.

1311
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:23,810
Guys now I know.

1312
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:26,510
Now I know why you can tell me to use fire resistance.

1313
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,950
Okay we don't need it.

1314
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,630
We are strong about it.

1315
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,570
We are just making.

1316
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,850
We are just doing the gamer run.

1317
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:40,910
We are just doing the gamer run.

1318
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,590
Oh no.

1319
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:42,890
No.

1320
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:48,130
We are just being gamers guys.

1321
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,370
We have to get rid of him first.

1322
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:52,150
Okay.

1323
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:52,730
It's okay.

1324
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,050
Everything is fine.

1325
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:54,990
The head stopped moving.

1326
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:56,090
He is fine.

1327
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:00,150
He stopped moving.

1328
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:01,950
We are so healthy.

1329
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:02,890
Okay nice.

1330
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,050
We are so healthy.

1331
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:05,950
He doesn't know.

1332
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,090
He cooled it.

1333
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:07,970
Oh no.

1334
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,990
No I ran into it.

1335
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:10,510
That's fine.

1336
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:11,030
That's fine.

1337
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:11,490
That's fine.

1338
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,890
That's fine.

1339
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,850
Stop moving.

1340
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,010
Quick as fire.

1341
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:15,650
Stop moving.

1342
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:16,890
He is...

1343
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,530
He is dead.

1344
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,070
I think he is dead.

1345
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,650
Okay nice.

1346
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:24,130
That's fine.

1347
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,690
He is so dead.

1348
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:29,370
How the fuck do I...

1349
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:31,250
What?

1350
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,410
Okay that's fine.

1351
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,950
I told you guys we didn't need it.

1352
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,510
I told you guys.

1353
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,570
And then I will do drags.

1354
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:42,930
Second time.

1355
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:44,650
There we go.

1356
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:45,890
See everything is fine.

1357
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,350
Okay.

1358
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:50,970
He is going to come down right?

1359
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,090
How the fuck...

1360
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,690
What is he doing?

1361
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:56,730
Like how do I kill him?

1362
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,390
How do I...

1363
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,950
He is just in the air.

1364
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,130
What is he doing?

1365
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,310
He is just breathing.

1366
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,770
What do I do?

1367
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:09,930
He is literally just...

1368
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,070
Oh there we go.

1369
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,370
Okay that's what I do.

1370
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,310
I'm like how the fuck do I...

1371
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,230
He is literally just breathing.

1372
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:19,710
Oh my god.

1373
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:20,370
This is dumb.

1374
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:21,510
This is...

1375
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:25,630
This is so dumb.

1376
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:28,710
Use pillar stats on the dragon.

1377
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,270
How do I use pillar stats?

1378
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,370
I literally just exist on the ground.

1379
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:33,210
I...

1380
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,410
What do you mean use pillar stats?

1381
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:40,390
Okay.

1382
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:44,370
Oh my god.

1383
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:45,990
Okay.

1384
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:47,710
It's fine.

1385
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,850
Oh my god you bitch.

1386
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,650
You fucking bitch.

1387
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:58,570
Is he going to...

1388
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,090
Oh he is going to breathe again.

1389
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,330
He is going to fucking breathe.

1390
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,150
Stop breathing.

1391
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:04,770
Yeah.

1392
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,150
Get down from here.

1393
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,390
Just stop breathing.

1394
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,530
I can't...

1395
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:15,710
I can't use pillar stats.

1396
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:15,990
Look.

1397
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:16,890
Oh I can.

1398
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,330
Oh shit.

1399
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:21,690
Sorry.

1400
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,510
When I found out I could use pillar stats it like surprised me.

1401
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,910
Oh you guys are right.

1402
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,250
I can.

1403
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:32,850
Okay.

1404
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:33,970
Nice.

1405
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,370
Okay.

1406
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,550
I can reach it.

1407
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,750
That's good.

1408
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:38,970
That's good.

1409
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,450
That is not good but that's okay.

1410
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,010
He needed to get down anyway.

1411
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,250
Yeah.

1412
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,470
You got this.

1413
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:51,930
All it took was trying.

1414
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,750
But the fire...

1415
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,190
Exactly.

1416
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,250
We don't need fire resistance chat.

1417
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1418
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:58,450
Thank you.

1419
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,570
You're a pretty lady.

1420
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,410
You're a pretty lady.

1421
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,430
You are a pretty lady.

1422
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,130
You are a pretty lady.

1423
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:06,230
Come on.

1424
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:06,670
Oh my god.

1425
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:09,910
If a monkey and a fox like each other very much.

1426
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:11,690
I mean.

1427
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:17,210
He knows a lot about banging other creatures.

1428
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:25,210
I thank god you are not a child.

1429
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,270
Oh Ping Ping.

1430
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:32,130
Hey, how are you her daughter?

1431
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,950
You're a fox.

1432
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:34,170
He's a bull.

1433
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,660
He killed her mother?

1434
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,060
What?

1435
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:15,680
What?

1436
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,660
Oh, maybe he got possessed.

1437
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,120
Who do I trust?

1438
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:59,680
Who do I trust?

1439
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,920
The heart?

1440
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,320
The hot lady?

1441
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,960
Or my bro?

1442
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,140
Oh my god, this choice is so hard.

1443
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:13,360
Bro, who do I trust?

1444
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,260
The answer is clear.

1445
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,600
You guys think so.

1446
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:24,660
But the amount of drama people cause because a bro has to choose between the hot lady and the bro.

1447
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,380
Like, that shit happens way too often.

1448
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:38,180
I was like, trust the hot lady first, then ask bro for forgiveness after.

1449
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,960
Until last, oldest time.

1450
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,680
Who do I follow?

1451
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,160
Oh no!

1452
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,300
Oh no!

1453
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,920
Who do I follow?

1454
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,140
Let's get to the shrine first.

1455
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,320
Okay, but the shrine is here, so like...

1456
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,620
I gotta go to the shrine first, hot lady.

1457
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,900
You know the answer, doki.

1458
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,000
Your bro got the spider, you get the fox.

1459
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,240
Bear is a bear!

1460
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:14,920
Bro!

1461
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,040
Okay, but bro, he didn't...

1462
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,340
He literally chose the bro.

1463
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,260
He literally chose the bro instead of the hot lady.

1464
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,440
Alright.

1465
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,480
Oh, okay.

1466
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,900
So I do have to go this way.

1467
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,120
What the fuck, hot lady?

1468
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,260
How the fuck was I supposed to follow you?

1469
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,780
Like, your path was fenced off.

1470
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,240
I had to go there anyway.

1471
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,040
Victor, thank you for the super chat.

1472
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,960
Thank you, thank you.

1473
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,580
Always choose bro since ancient time.

1474
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,480
Sworn bro is eternal.

1475
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1476
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,940
Thank you, thank you.

1477
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,400
Okay, there's a...

1478
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,440
There's a thing here.

1479
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,540
Yes, I get medicine.

1480
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:58,860
Medicine.

1481
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,280
I like medicine.

1482
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,960
It increases health.

1483
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:03,700
Alright.

1484
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:04,920
Let's see.

1485
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,000
I wanted...

1486
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:17,480
What do I get?

1487
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:21,460
Alteration.

1488
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,580
Cloud step.

1489
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,020
Oh, I should upgrade my cloud step.

1490
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,020
I just realized my cloud step is so under in love mode.

1491
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,260
Holy shit.

1492
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,360
Whoops.

1493
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,620

As we go this way.

1496
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,480
As we go this way.

1497
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:40,880

1506
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,460
She's already pitting me against my bro.

1507
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:12,460
Big hot lady monkey needs love.

1509
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,500

Can't be that bad.

01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,720
Don't give in.

1516
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,700
Don't give in, Doki.

1517
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,320
Resist the charm!

1518
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,940

01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,460

01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,100
I guess I go this way.

1522
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,680
But there's like a way to go up.

1523
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:11,960
I don't know what up is.

1524
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,640
She is kind of cute though.

1525
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:22,180
Guys, this time will be different, guys.

1526
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,880
Guys, she's like perfect for me.

1527
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,420

What was it?

1533
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,520
The hotness crazy scale?

1534
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,580
Like, I think it's worth it.

1535
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:53,320
I think like the hotness like contributes to the crazy.

1536
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,900
It like justifies the crazy.

1537
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:10,170
Do I just jump?

1538
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,750

01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:58,230
Guys, she didn't come down with me.

1550
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,150

1552

01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,290

1554
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:08,850
I thought she was gonna jump with me.

1555
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,230
Wait a minute.

1556
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:12,910
Wait a minute.

1557
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:15,750

1558
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,810
Yeah, but I thought, you know, I thought she'd jump with me.

You sure you want to move that fast?

1565
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,850
Oh my god, we're practically married.

1566
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,650
Oh my god, should I grab him?

1567

Guys, guys, should I buy...

1568
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:41,590
Do you think I should propose to her in front of the...

1569
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:44,670
I should like ask her dad for like her hand in marriage.

1570

Guys, do you think that's too fast?

You think...

1572
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:52,550
I mean, now that I'm there, I might as well ask her father's approval.

1573
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,730

01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:58,670

1579
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,870

It's over.

1581
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:15,310
It's over for her.

1582
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:18,890
Oh shit.

1583
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:21,690

And then like maybe he'll pay for the ring because their family's rich.

1593
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:01,470
There's a boss if you drop down the cliff to the right.

1594
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:03,210
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1614
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:36,990
Okay.

1615
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:38,450
Oh, I can soak more.

1616
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:42,670
Okay.

1617
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:43,330
It's okay.

1618
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:43,830
Hey, what?

1619
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:44,950
It's the worm.

1620
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,090
Whatever happened to the worm?

1621
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,990
Is the worm like grown yet?

1622
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,170
I gave him a worm.

1623
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:58,030
Whatever the fuck happened to it?

1624
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,890
Can I, am I allowed to fight the tiger again?

1625
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:05,630
Like, does the tiger have any more upgrades?

1626
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:08,450
Oh, go to the right?

1627
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:09,050
I left the right to the left?

1628
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:12,550
There is a right side?

1629
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,190
No there isn't.

1630
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,130
Oh what the fuck!

1631
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,390
What the fuck is that?

1632
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,710
What an ugly child.

1633
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:26,230
Here, eat some ugly food, you ugly child.

1634
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:29,770
And then you'll grow up to be even uglier, I guess.

1635
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,150
Or like, I don't know, maybe you'll be like the ugly duckling.

1636
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,170
I don't know.

1637
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:37,710
I can still feed him.

1638
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,570
Feed the ugly baby.

1639
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:43,610
Brandon!

1640
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,670
Do I just feed him?

1641
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,730
Or am I feeding him anyway?

1642
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,770
Oh my god, it's growing bigger!

1643
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:54,330
Is it?

1644
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:55,250
I can't tell.

1645
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,710
He's so, like...

1646
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:02,570
I don't think... You guys even loved me when I was a worm!

1647
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:03,490
Like...

1648
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:06,770
You guys literally didn't even...

1649
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:09,590
I turned into a worm and you're like, I'm gonna unsubscribe.

1650
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:18,070
You literally was like, I'm gonna unsubscribe after I turned into a fucking worm.

1651
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,710
I don't fucking trust you guys.

1652
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:25,870
Wait, what was the thing I fucking upgraded?

1653
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,590
Was this this?

1654
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:36,970
Do you see what I'm saying?

1655
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:38,590
Was it this I upgraded?

1656
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,210
It's not even good.

1657
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:43,090
Alright.

1658
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:45,090
This isn't even a good upgrade.

1659
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:45,710
Okay.

1660
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,170
Let's rest then.

1661
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:50,510
Alright.

1662
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,330
Oh, did he...

1663
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:53,610
Oh my god, he died?

1664
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,830
I overfed him!

1665
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:02,210
Oh my god, I killed him!

1666
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,790
Holy shit, I fed him too much!

1667
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:08,410
I'm so...

1668
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:10,050
I'm so sorry!

1669
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:13,250
I didn't mean to call you ugly!

1670
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:14,950
I'm so...

1671
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,970
Guys, don't cyber-bully!

1672
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:17,990
Don't!

1673
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:22,450
Guys, cyber-bullying is wrong!

1674
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:25,150
Never call somebody an ugly worm!

1675
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:27,730
I'm so sorry!

1676
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:30,330
I love you!

1677
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,370
I love you!

1678
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:32,950
I love you!

1679
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,350
Holy shit!

1680
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:38,110
What happened to him?

1681
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:40,450
I thought he wanted food!

1682
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:47,730
The damn does just try to feed him food!

1683
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:52,890
Today is do-crime day.

1684
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:55,170
I'm just...

1685
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:57,790
I'm just doing lots of crime today.

1686
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:01,410
Where even is he?

1687
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,930
Is that him?

1688
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:12,470
Me overfeeding my goldfish.

1689
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,910
It's just crime day.

1690
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,510
I didn't mean to roast.

1691
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:19,770
Alright, flaming mountains.

1692
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,330
I assume it's here.

1693
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:27,930
We learned a valuable lesson today, didn't we?

1694
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:28,750
Okay.

1695
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:30,290
Okay.

1696
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,690
Okay.

1697
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:33,650
Okay.

1698
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,190
Okay.

1699
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:36,130
Holy fuck.

1700
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,510
This is actually crazy.

1701
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:40,870
I can't believe he fucking died!

1702
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:45,810
How was I supposed to know he was gonna fucking die?

1703
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:48,190
I didn't know that!

1704
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,910
But there's a secret boss here, so I guess I'll jump down again.

1705
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,550
Oh, he won't let me jump down, guys.

1706
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,250
Guys, he told me to jump.

1707
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:57,210
Shit!

1708
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:59,610
Holy fu- Okay, that actually scared me.

1709
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:02,350
I was like so busy looking at the...

1710
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,070
I was so busy looking...

1711
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,290
He won't let me jump!

1712
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,210
I said...

1713
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:10,610
Jesus Christ.

1714
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:13,530
The scream- Oh my god, it's cheeked up though!

1715
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,770
He's like cheeked up.

1716
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,510
And everything.

1717
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:19,770
Can I jump here?

1718
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:23,070
Can't jump here.

1719
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:27,630
Oh my god, can I jump here?

1720
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,630
I hate that scream!

1721
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:35,090
It's- Are you fucking- Oh, now- Are you fucking kidding me?!

1722
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:37,250
Oh!

1723
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:41,930
Now I'm allowed to fucking go down, I guess.

1724
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:42,870
Okay.

1725
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,370
That's so bullshit!

1726
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:47,770
That's actually so bullshit!

1727
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:48,790
That is so bullshit!

1728
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,410
Oh my god.

1729
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:51,970
Okay.

1730
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:53,990
Okay.

1731
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:56,230
I need to get rid of the baby first though.

1732
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:57,990
The baby is very annoying.

1733
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:01,630
Oh god, oh god.

1734
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,110
I hate this.

1735
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:08,130
Bro, he is so fucking weak!

1736
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:08,350
Okay.

1737
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:09,970
Okay.

1738
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:11,650
Oh!

1739
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:14,570
This is not good for me!

1740
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,970
This is absolutely not good!

1741
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,650
Guys, no, it's fine.

1742
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,410
We don't need it.

1743
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:30,930
Guys,

1744
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:35,090
no.

1745
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:37,230
We can- we don't need it.

1746
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:40,490
Guys, we can do this without Fire Manta.

1747
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:42,630
It's okay.

1748
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:44,350
It's okay.

1749
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:46,170
We're so- we're so okay.

1750
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,070
I know where they are now.

1751
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,030
I know where they are.

1752
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:52,190
Like, I know how to avoid this.

1753
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:54,830
We'll be fine.

1754
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,470
We just need- look, it's Kazoo or Two!

1755
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:01,070
Like, I'm getting literally bullied right now!

1756
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:02,750
I'm getting fucking cyberbullied!

1757
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,410
Because I cyberbullied a worm!

1758
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:09,890
We don't need it.

1759
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:11,770
I just need to get rid of the big guy.

1760
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:15,250
I literally have to get rid of this guy right here.

1761
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,830
This fucker, right?

1762
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:22,830
It's revenge for- it's revenge for the worm.

1763
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,950
The moment I get rid of him, we're fine!

1764
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:27,230
There we go.

1765
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,050
Okay.

1766
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,090
Okay, I just- watch this.

1767
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:33,250
Okay, he's right here.

1768
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:33,730
Watch this.

1769
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:38,470
I don't know how to get back up, but like- but like, it'll be fine.

1770
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:44,790
Like, the only issue is that I- I sort of don't know how to get back upstairs, but that's okay.

1771
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,830
Like, that will be fine.

1772
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,490
Like, will be fine.

1773
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:57,810
Okay, nice.

1774
01:29:58,930 --> 01:29:59,370
Okay.

1775
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:02,750
Okay, we're fine.

1776
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:03,710
See, I told you.

1777
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:04,770
We're so fine.

1778
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:10,470
Oh, shit!

1779
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:11,910
Oh, shit!

1780
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,310
Okay!

1781
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,790
No, I didn't mean to do that!

1782
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:17,790
That was the wrong move, but little monkeys go I guess.

1783
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:21,850
This is a little overkill, but that's okay.

1784
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:22,290
He's dead.

1785
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:22,950
Okay.

1786
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:25,470
I didn't mean to do that.

1787
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:27,050
The turtle treasure.

1788
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:29,250
The human heart swings good and ill.

1789
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,530
Wealth and treasure, three freedoms.

1790
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,010
Okay.

1791
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,670
I don't know how... Okay.

1792
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:40,410
The only problem is that I don't know how to get out of the lava area.

1793
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,670
That's the only problem.

1794
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:45,070
Alright.

1795
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,390
Nice.

1796
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:48,650
Thanks, guys.

1797
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:51,130
Oh, I should have healed before I refilled it.

1798
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:51,710
Oh well.

1799
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:56,210
I should have done a lot of things like put on the fucking fire mantle, but oh well.

1800
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:57,830
Wait, this doesn't burn.

1801
01:30:58,570 --> 01:30:59,890
Wait, this part doesn't burn.

1802
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:00,610
We were fine.

1803
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:02,830
This part burns!

1804
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,470
Guys!

1805
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,910
Guys, I fucked up.

1806
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:13,290
I fucked up, guys.

1807
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:15,070
Oh no!

1808
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:16,970
Drop!

1809
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:17,230
Stop!

1810
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:18,210
Drop it!

1811
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:18,510
Roll!

1812
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:20,870
Wait, I have an idea.

1813
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:22,910
I have an idea.

1814
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:30,590
Never punish!

1815
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,550
Let's fucking go!

1816
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:34,670
Oh, I was dying.

1817
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:41,990
It still burns.

1818
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,650
I wasn't looking at my HP.

1819
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,370
I thought I was on fire.

1820
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:52,990
I literally thought I wasn't on fire because I was invisible.

1821
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,150
I didn't know I was on fire.

1822
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:58,570
Okay.

1823
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,590
I guess I'll...

1824
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:04,150
I guess I'll put the fire mantle...

1825
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:05,350
Where is it?

1826
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:06,650
What's it look like?

1827
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:09,530
I don't even know what it is.

1828
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,490
Is it like armor?

1829
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:13,810
Like, what is it?

1830
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,830
Oh, it's in relics?

1831
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,070
Oh, okay.

1832
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:20,870
Okay.

1833
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,010
Let's see.

1834
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,510
Wait, where is it?

1835
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,660
It's a vessel slot?

1836
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:41,970
Oh, vessel!

1837
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,990
Where the fuck...

1838
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:49,190
Oh, this thing!

1839
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:50,270
Oh my god!

1840
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:51,270
I remember now!

1841
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,070
This fucker!

1842
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,530
Oh my god!

1843
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,050
I'll remember this now.

1844
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:00,470
Wait, is that mini-boss still there?

1845
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:04,610
Alright.

1846
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,410
Boom.

1847
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:07,810
That's fucking right.

1848
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:08,850
You can't keep me anymore.

1849
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:11,110
Fuck, okay.

1850
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:12,710
Bro, look at their cheeks!

1851
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,470
Like, they're all cheeked up!

1852
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:17,590
Fine.

1853
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:18,490
They won.

1854
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:21,770
Is he still there?

1855
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,590
No, he's dead.

1856
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:24,530
Okay, nice.

1857
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:29,090
I'm just gonna...

1858
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:31,410
Nice.

1859
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:34,730
Wait, does he have...

1860
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:35,910
Oh shit!

1861
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:36,410
Okay!

1862
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,730
Sorry, I won't objectify your... but...

1863
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:41,550
Do I need to be down there?

1864
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:44,810
I feel like I already got every...

1865
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:45,910
Oh my god!

1866
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:48,190
Why are you so strong?

1867
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,950
You're just a fucking rock!

1868
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:53,630
Do I need to be down there anymore?

1869
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:55,070
Or am I fine?

1870
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,630
Oh, I reached it.

1871
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:02,910
Nice.

1872
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,250
I wasn't sure.

1873
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:05,710
Not really?

1874
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:06,630
Okay, nice.

1875
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,510
I don't have to be there.

1876
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,290
I'm just like...

1877
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:12,470
No mouse-butting in it?

1878
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:14,450
To see if there's any...

1879
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:15,070
Oh shit!

1880
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:15,470
Oh!

1881
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:16,370
Unlucky.

1882
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:18,250
But no, lucky for me.

1883
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:19,130
Unlucky for you.

1884
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:21,430
Oh, nice.

1885
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:21,730
Okay.

1886
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,490
Oh!

1887
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,690
Please let me go!

1888
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,170
Oh shit!

1889
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,230
That's fine.

1890
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:31,450
I'm not that scared of you.

1891
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:33,290
I'm gonna do this now, cause I...

1892
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:34,610
Wait, what?

1893
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:35,370
I'm not hitting...

1894
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:36,550
I'm not even hitting his shield!

1895
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:38,170
What the fuck?

1896
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,130
I wasn't even hitting his shield!

1897
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,990
That is so not fair!

1898
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:49,870
I literally wasn't even hitting his shield, but it counted!

1899
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,690
Just trying to see if there's any hidden enemies around me.

1900
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,830
Oh, there you are.

1901
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,730
I see you.

1902
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:02,270
Kai kai kai?

1903
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:03,530
cough...

1904
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,590
Adams.

1905
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:19,070
вп Okay.

1906
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:20,710
He called me Wee!

1907
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:21,550
He's caught me!

1908
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:21,710
Eh?

1909
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:27,410
Hey

1910
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:31,450
guys!

1911
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:35,470
It's so fucked up!

1912
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,530
I can walk on lava, whoops.

1913
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,930
I forgot about that.

1914
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:42,670
I was so scared.

1915
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:48,630
Sorry, it was just trauma.

1916
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,410
A PTSD from all the lava.

1917
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,550
That I was too scared to walk on it.

1918
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:57,430
There's anything here.

1919
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,930
I mean there's a lot of worms guarding.

1920
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,250
I feel like there might be something here.

1921
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:03,450
Oh there he is!

1922
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,390
I see you!

1923
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:05,950
You think I don't see you?

1924
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:07,230
You're a giant fucking car!

1925
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:09,930
You think I don't see you over there?

1926
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,290
Why pillar stance?

1927
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,730
I just like it right now.

1928
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:16,490
Should I use another stance?

1929
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,710
It's just convenient because they're like over here.

1930
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:23,610
What is that?

1931
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:27,900
Wait.

1932
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:28,860
Why is that...

1933
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:29,800
Is that guy dead?

1934
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,740
Why is there like a...

1935
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,480
Oh shit!

1936
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:34,800
Okay.

1937
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,620
Yeah like...

1938
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,780
Why is there another cart guy here?

1939
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:39,640
But like he's dead.

1940
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:42,880
Oh fuck!

1941
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:43,620
Where am I?

1942
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,460
Where am I?

1943
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:45,120
Where am I?

1944
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,580
Where did I go?

1945
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,320
Okay, nice.

1946
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,900
New Lesser Yaoguai.

1947
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,140
The monkey roams...

1948
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,740
far away from landed homes.

1949
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:55,680
A tenner?

1950
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,080
Is he gonna have ten dollars for me?

1951
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,440
Use the fire mantle?

1952
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:01,780
Why?

1953
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,520
Oh the fire resistance?

1954
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:04,460
No!

1955
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,320
But he's dead!

1956
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,000
He's dead!

1957
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,640
I'm gonna take your soul.

1958
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:20,170
Unless he's not dead?

1959
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,210
Hello?

1960
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,600
Ring ring!

1961
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,380
Once I am dead,...

1962
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,180
everyone will die.

1963
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,380
My only path will be death.

1964
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,120
I can wait in the car for you.

1965
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,440
Ready to die hold on your mace and enjoy my authority.

1966
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,020
If you can't save me then end my life without escape.

1967
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,680
If it won't be this country or my world.

1968
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:57,150
Big shot...

1969
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:58,010
Support to my legacy.

1970
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:13,190
Bro!

1971
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:14,470
That's his whip!

1972
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:16,090
That's his hot sexy whip!

1973
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:31,070
Stop pulling!

1974
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:34,530
But like, why can't I pull it?

1975
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,580
But what if I pull it?

1976
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,120
But what if I pull it?

1977
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:52,660
Right?

1978
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,960
He's like, bro, stop pulling it!

1979
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,000
I'll die!

1980
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,640
I'm like, okay.

1981
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,100
But will you really die?

1982
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,700
Are you just over exaggerating, bro?

1983
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:16,940
He could have been over exaggerating.

1984
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:18,220
You don't know it anyway.

1985
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:19,780
You don't know that.

1986
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,360
Pulls harder.

1987
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,560
He could have just been over exaggerating, guys.

1988
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,980
I don't believe you, man.

1989
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,320
Like, how would you know?

1990
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:37,460
Wait, where do I go?

1991
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,080
I'm lost.

1992
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,960
Bro's just being a little dramatic.

1993
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:43,920
Oh, we go this way.

1994
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,560
Yeah, he's just being fucking dramatic, guys.

1995
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,580
Like, you don't know that.

1996
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,940
He's just being like, just being silly.

1997
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:56,760
Nice, okay.

1998
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:57,420
That's good.

1999
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,040
Whoa, whoa!

2000
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,060
Whoa, whoa!

2001
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,780
That's fucking right, bro.

2002
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,820
I'm just trying to go around him.

2003
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:07,360
Yay!

2004
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:09,160
Nice.

2005
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:12,120
Alright.

2006
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:15,280
You don't need it.

2007
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,020
I like how that guy's implied pull it.

2008
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,160
You don't need the transformation.

2009
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,680
Just pull it.

2010
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:23,200
Oh, hey.

2011
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:24,700
I didn't see that.

2012
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,840
Oh, now I know.

2013
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,480
Oh, okay.

2014
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,540
And then everybody came over to have a party.

2015
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,860
Oh, shit.

2016
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,520
What the fuck?

2017
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,020
That's rude.

2018
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,260
That's so rude.

2019
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,900
I had to do that.

2020
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:44,320
Actually, you're not worth my time.

2021
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,360
You're only 119.

2022
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,960
The EXP is just 119.

2023
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,840
It's not worth it.

2024
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,380
Alright, up we go.

2025
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,000
Up we go.

2026
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,380
I wonder if I should drop down or not.

2027
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Left or right?

2028
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:02,480
What's that?

2029
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,440
Oh, it's a transformation.

2030
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,340
Okay, I'm going to go behind him this time.

2031
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,780
I learned my lesson.

2032
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:12,900
Okay.

2033
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,760
I need to reload.

2034
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,390
Okay.

2035
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:20,370
Did I hit the... Oh.

2036
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:21,190
No!

2037
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:22,290
Did I hit the shield?

2038
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:23,450
God!

2039
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:23,910
You know what?

2040
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:24,310
Fuck this.

2041
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:25,230
Big baby!

2042
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:26,730
Oh, okay.

2043
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:28,070
That's not what I wanted.

2044
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:29,130
But that's okay.

2045
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:30,630
I might as well get rid of the shield then.

2046
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:32,630
But I might as well...

2047
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:35,470
Whoa!

2048
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:36,650
What are you going to do?

2049
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:37,350
You have no shield.

2050
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:38,370
I'm on fire.

2051
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:39,370
But what are you going to do?

2052
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,150
Fucking easy.

2053
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:43,050
Alright, get over here.

2054
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:45,250
You don't matter to me.

2055
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:47,430
That's how little you mattered.

2056
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:48,410
I let you live.

2057
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,410
Even during this fight.

2058
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:54,750
Alright, nice.

2059
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:55,910
Another cast.

2060
01:41:57,870 --> 01:41:59,070
Look at that guy.

2061
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:00,470
Alright.

2062
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:01,390
Grave time.

2063
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:02,890
Yay!

2064
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:07,750
Yeah!

2065
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,910
Okay.

2066
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:14,590
Off we go.

2067
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:17,850
Guess we go right side.

2068
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:18,510
Yeah.

2069
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:19,510
We go west.

2070
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:21,490
We keep going west.

2071
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:23,150
Yay!

2072
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:24,510
Whoa!

2073
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:27,230
Okay.

2074
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:27,730
Okay.

2075
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:28,770
Oh my god!

2076
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:29,950
What the...

2077
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:31,510
No!

2078
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:34,290
Stop, drop and roll.

2079
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:35,270
Stop, drop and roll.

2080
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:36,250
Stop, drop and roll.

2081
01:42:36,370 --> 01:42:37,770
Stop, drop and roll.

2082
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:38,630
Holy fuck!

2083
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:39,190
What a combo!

2084
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:40,590
Oh my god!

2085
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:43,310
Okay, I did not expect that combo.

2086
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:46,470
Oh my god.

2087
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:48,810
I almost got killed by a big rock guy.

2088
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:51,990
I want super tanky rock man.

2089
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:55,110
But we're okay.

2090
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,430
Oh, this looks like a boss fight.

2091
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,650
This is an open area.

2092
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,920
I'm wanted?

2093
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,480
Oh my god, there's a bounty on me?

2094
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,180
How did he know about my crime?

2095
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:15,770
Who told them?

2096
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:21,250
Misty clouds.

2097
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:22,250
Cloudiness.

2098
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:26,730
Guys, who ratted me out?

2099
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:29,090
Who the fuck ratted me out?

2100
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,610
I thought we had an agreement.

2101
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,990
No, this is not what I wanted.

2102
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:37,050
I keep using the wrong power up.

2103
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:40,730
No, we had an agreement!

2104
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:41,310
Guys!

2105
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:47,650
Who ratted me out?

2106
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,650
What the fuck?

2107
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:54,930
What the fuck?

2108
01:43:54,990 --> 01:43:55,490
What?

2109
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:57,550
Who is he?

2110
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:00,850
Oh my god!

2111
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:01,530
What?

2112
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,460
Holy shit.

2113
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,440
Why I...

2114
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,140
Is this level just two bosses all the time?

2115
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,220
What the fuck?

2116
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:22,100
I hate that.

2117
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,500
I actually don't like that.

2118
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:24,900
This is so...

2119
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,460
This is not cool.

2120
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,120
This is not cool, guys.

2121
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,780
This is not cool.

2122
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,000
It's literally just getting jumped.

2123
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Get what?

2124
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:38,800
Okay!

2125
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,180
Where are they?

2126
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,580
Oh my god.

2127
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,840
You stupid fucking troll.

2128
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,020
Okay.

2129
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,180
That's fine.

2130
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:52,060
Dark souls.

2131
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:55,240
Swing.

2132
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,300
Oh, you bitch.

2133
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,020
You're so...

2134
01:44:59,020 --> 01:44:59,540
Fuck.

2135
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,640
You're such a weak ass.

2136
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,020
Oh, nice.

2137
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,060
He blinded his own teammate.

2138
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,380
That's fucking right.

2139
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,440
That's right, you don't work well together!

2140
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,920
You have no chemistry!

2141
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,640
You might be the best gamer!

2142
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:18,860
Guys, remember, even if they're really good individually, they have no teamwork!

2143
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:25,160
That's why you can't make a team with just good players if they have zero chemistry!

2144
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,040
If they have zero chemistry, it doesn't fucking matter!

2145
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:39,420
Oh god!

2146
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:43,080
Nice!

2147
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:44,020
Okay, we got him!

2148
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,580
That's fucking right!

2149
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,180
That's right, you have no teammate!

2150
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:51,780
Your teammate quit!

2151
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:52,640
He left the team!

2152
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,540
You are just bullshit!

2153
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,180
Okay!

2154
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:00,100
Your teammate left the team because you were a bad teammate!

2155
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:05,140
Oh god, I'm getting cocky though.

2156
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:06,360
Holy shit, I'm so sorry.

2157
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,260
I'm getting so cocky!

2158
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:13,160
Your rage quit!

2159
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,540
Doesn't matter if you're rank 1 or rank 2!

2160
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:19,940
If you can't even work together, bitch!

2161
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,160
That's right!

2162
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,320
That's fucking right!

2163
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:24,920
Oh yes, nice!

2164
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:26,380
More cold iron leaves!

2165
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,040
My favorite!

2166
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,700
Yay!

2167
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,240
Cold iron leaves!

2168
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,860
Let's fucking go!

2169
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:37,820
Nice job!

2170
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,960
Let the strange be strange.

2171
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,680
Follow the mad boy master.

2172
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,980
Let mountains fall and...

2173
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:47,440
Oh my god, how am I not being able to read anything today?

2174
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:52,560
Was that... Was that the... Was that him?

2175
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,740
Was that the boss I had to defeat to talk to the horse guy?

2176
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,360
Or is it not that boss?

2177
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,020
Or is it another boss?

2178
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:00,860
Chat.

2179
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:02,900
No?

2180
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:03,520
Okay.

2181
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,020
Well, it's not that boss.

2182
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:06,140
Okay, up we go.

2183
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:08,440
Up we go.

2184
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,600
Where the fuck is the shrine?

2185
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:15,880
That's like two bosses today that were like just two characters.

2186
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,200
I don't like that.

2187
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,480
I don't like bosses where it's two characters.

2188
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,140
Because I feel like that's super cheap.

2189
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:27,400
Because I know in Darks... in the Souls game...

2190
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,280
Or is it Bloodborne?

2191
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:33,740
Lots of Souls games like to do it, but I feel like...

2192
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:36,700
I feel like that's like mega cheap.

2193
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:40,860
Alright, rest.

2194
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,280
I need to recharge my heals.

2195
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:48,700
I like how this world... I don't know if you guys noticed it, but this map has like less... less...

2196
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:50,280
What's the word?

2197
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:54,240
Less graph... intense... scenery?

2198
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,380
Less physics.

2199
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:59,680
So because of that, we're not lagging.

2200
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:03,540
There's less leaves.

2201
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:11,320
It's an uglier like area, so there's...

2202
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,060
I don't say uglier.

2203
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:17,100
I mean, it's like there's less like physics going around.

2204
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,960
So I don't have to worry about extra frames.

2205
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:22,960
Yeah, it's fire and lava.

2206
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:24,540
It's not an ugly area.

2207
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,420
It's just like less stuff going on in the background.

2208
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,300
Because there are like really pretty areas there.

2209
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,220
Like the mountains with the faces.

2210
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,280
No leaves.

2211
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,320
Just... wait, am I just hitting the arm?

2212
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,260
I just realized I'm just hitting the shield.

2213
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,920
I was like, wait a minute.

2214
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:41,520
This HP is not going down.

2215
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:45,280
It's just rocks, so there's nothing moving in general.

2216
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,260
Oh my god, please.

2217
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:47,180
I'm like stuck here.

2218
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,980
Oh no, he fucking moved me off.

2219
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,860
He knocked me off the platform.

2220
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,040
Yeah, less particles.

2221
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:57,180
So I don't have to worry.

2222
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,980
Should I even...

2223
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:02,900
What?

2224
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:05,840
What did you say?

2225
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:07,860
Do I even need to be in the lava?

2226
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:09,160
No, right?

2227
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:14,620
Is there anything in the lava that I have to do?

2228
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:15,320
Chat?

2229
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:20,540
Oh god.

2230
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:21,020
No?

2231
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,540
Okay, I'll just stay up here then.

2232
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,940
There are items in the lava?

2233
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,140
Okay, some of you guys say yes, some of you guys say no.

2234
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,480
And then others are like maybe.

2235
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:31,120
Items?

2236
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,780
Yeah, but what kind of item?

2237
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:33,740
Oh, I see a chest there.

2238
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,200
I guess I'll go for that chest.

2239
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,180
I'll go for that chest over there.

2240
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:44,960
Whoa, hello big guy.

2241
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:49,720
Nice.

2242
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,700
Is it him that's saying stuff?

2243
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:55,420
Give me your money.

2244
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:01,600
One day you'll face Ornstein and Smog, so those bosses are good for training.

2245
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:02,540
Thank you for the super chat.

2246
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:03,200
That's the...

2247
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:04,220
Uh...

2248
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:05,460
Souls slash...

2249
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,060
I don't remember.

2250
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:10,400
That's the guy with the big fat guy and the skinny guy, right?

2251
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:16,460
I know there's like a famous Dark Souls boss that's like twins.

2252
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,340
And like people hate fighting them.

2253
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:22,220
Yeah.

2254
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:23,500
Those two.

2255
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,400
Oh, it was these guys that were talking.

2256
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:33,400
Yeah, I heard about them because they're like infamous for being like really frustrating to fight.

2257
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:36,320
Grandma!

2258
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:38,380
Welcome to the tomato farm!

2259
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,080
Welcome, welcome!

2260
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:39,360
Welcome!

2261
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,500
Nice.

2262
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,340
All right.

2263
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,060
Wait, he's different?

2264
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:46,360
How is he different from all the other bulls I killed?

2265
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:48,960
No matter what, good meat.

2266
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,900
All right, let's go over here.

2267
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,480
No matter what, food's food.

2268
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,620
All right.

2269
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:03,500
All right, I think that's...

2270
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:08,840
Honestly, I feel like the items are just cold iron leaves, so I'm gonna ignore it.

2271
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:13,240
I'm tired of grand opening boxes.

2272
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:15,920
And it's just cold iron leaves.

2273
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:18,780
I'm fucking tired of that chat.

2274
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:22,160
It's just all cold iron leaves.

2275
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:26,760
I don't care about cold iron leaves.

2276
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:30,720
And I'm tired of pretending that I do.

2277
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,300
What have you...

2278
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:35,620
I have a hundred!

2279
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,480
I don't need anymore.

2280
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:41,360
I have a hundred cold iron leaves, chat.

2281
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:43,500
Holy shit, that's a big guy.

2282
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,920
Oh, hey, he's a rhino.

2283
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,360
That's a big-ass guy.

2284
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,440
Do I have to fight him?

2285
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:53,180
Do you think if I ask nicely, he'll let me through?

2286
01:51:54,820 --> 01:52:01,360
Yes, do you think if I ask him, he'll let me through, guys?

2287
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:06,280
Maybe he'll be nice enough, guys.

2288
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:10,300
Maybe he will.

2289
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:19,290
Honestly, I'm in New Game Plus and I spent less than ten.

2290
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:20,670
Wow, what is that?

2291
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:22,670
Is that more cold iron leaves?

2292
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:24,210
Whippy!

2293
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:29,330
Take some more cold iron leaves.

2294
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:31,870
Thank you for the super chat.

2295
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:32,750
Thank you, thank you.

2296
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:35,490
Is it worth fighting these guys, chat?

2297
01:52:37,930 --> 01:52:38,950
Is it worth it?

2298
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:39,790
Or he's just there?

2299
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:45,170
Don't worry, you can...

2300
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:48,290
Guys, I'm just asking if it's worth it.

2301
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:51,050
If I don't have to fight him, I won't fight him.

2302
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:53,850
Like, if he gives me nothing, like, why the fu...

2303
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:54,750
Holy shit!

2304
01:52:55,190 --> 01:52:58,830
Like, I have to walk so far to even get to this fucker!

2305
01:52:59,310 --> 01:52:59,830
Like...

2306
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:04,050
Like, what the fuck?

2307
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:06,950
He's so fucking fine.

2308
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:07,890
Like...

2309
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:08,530
Like...

2310
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:10,230
Where's his HP?

2311
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:14,070
I have to look up to see where the fuck his HP is!

2312
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:15,870
There we go.

2313
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:18,850
Alright, what did I get?

2314
01:53:19,110 --> 01:53:20,150
Let's see it.

2315
01:53:20,490 --> 01:53:21,370
Bro, he...

2316
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,210
He didn't give me shit!

2317
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:24,010
It was 700!

2318
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:26,750
Come on, bro.

2319
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:28,990
Bro, he give Jack shit!

2320
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:30,310
What do you mean?

2321
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:33,590
He was really far.

2322
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:36,770
He was actually a lot bigger than I expected.

2323
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:39,070
Holy fuck.

2324
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:42,470
It's like, don't worry, he gives you loot.

2325
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:43,250
The fuck you...

2326
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,010
Oh, hey, it's this guy.

2327
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:46,510
I'm gonna take your items real quick.

2328
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,390
Uh, quick.

2329
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:50,110
It gave you character.

2330
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:57,250
Oh, he didn't give me a new gourd?

2331
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:58,270
Yeah!

2332
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:05,710
Beard the Big Dope!

2333
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:10,870
You're not gonna be able to eat the whole cake without enjoying the remaining milk.

2334
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:11,250
Ah!

2335
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:12,810
You need to kill both!

2336
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:15,710
Okay, now you're fucking gaslighting me!

2337
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:19,990
There's no way I had to kill both of them to get lugar!

2338
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:28,890
Are you fucking serious?!

2339
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:34,230
Are you done talking is?

2340
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:35,970
Oh, okay.

2341
01:54:35,970 --> 01:54:37,310
Okay, you are...

2342
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:38,610
What?

2343
01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:39,670
Did I get it?

2344
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:41,910
Is that everything?

2345
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:44,670
Oh, okay.

2346
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:47,090
What is this?

2347
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:56,580
Here's five dollars to buy some cold iron leaves from the store.

2348
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:59,280
I heard you were short on them.

2349
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:02,160
Thank you for the super chat, John.

2350
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:05,820
Guys, I cannot wait to get my fucking favorite thing.

2351
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,040
Cold iron leaves.

2352
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,100
Let's fucking go.

2353
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:13,620
Oh my god, it's like a goddamn journey to get to this fucker.

2354
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:16,120
Look how far he is!

2355
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,140
I'm still running!

2356
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,200
I'm literally still running.

2357
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,140
How the fuck was I still running?

2358
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,620
I don't understand.

2359
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,240
Get over here.

2360
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,560
Fall the fuck down.

2361
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:37,120
I can't reach the other leg!

2362
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,640
His leg is in the wall!

2363
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:39,880
His...

2364
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,640
Oh my god, this...

2365
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,540
Bro, his foot was in the wall!

2366
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,580
This is actually bullshit.

2367
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:49,860
Holy fuck.

2368
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,640
I literally couldn't do anything.

2369
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,860
Oh my god, bro, please let me stay under you.

2370
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,320
Let me stay.

2371
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:02,560
That's actually bullshit.

2372
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:03,840
Okay, you can't do...

2373
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:06,180
It's like the fucking... What was it?

2374
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:07,320
The colossal titan.

2375
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,620
He's so fucking big but he can't do jack shit.

2376
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:16,500
Cause he's so fucking... There's too much mass in there that he can't reach me cause I'm so fucking tiny compared to him.

2377
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,700
He's like War M.

2378
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,980
I'm literally an ant just biting his ankles.

2379
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,240
Oh hey, I got the gold button.

2380
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,820
I'm like an fucking ant!

2381
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:28,260
What even is... Right?

2382
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:30,340
I was like, what the fuck was that shield for?

2383
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:33,340
I think it was just biting his fucking ankle.

2384
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:36,540
Oh shit.

2385
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:37,080
Okay.

2386
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,080
That was pretty funny though.

2387
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:45,660
That was pretty funny though.

2388
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,180
Like, literally the most useless fucking guard.

2389
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:54,420
Like, this is actually so fucking useless.

2390
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,980
Oh shit.

2391
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:02,040
What the fuck?

2392
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:05,460
Um...

2393
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:07,160
Do I go left or right, chat?

2394
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,060
I mean, there is a shrine here.

2395
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:12,500
Oh, there's a sign.

2396
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:13,380
Wait, there's a...

2397
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:15,400
I just noticed a sign.

2398
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,040
Wait, do I... Wait.

2399
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,560
Oh my god, I didn't see you over here.

2400
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:19,280
Might as well.

2401
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,080
Might as well be here.

2402
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:23,780
Steps up the stairs.

2403
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:25,400
But what about this side?

2404
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:28,020
There's like a area over here.

2405
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,000
Should I go there?

2406
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:33,320
What's the area over there?

2407
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:33,600
What's over there?

2408
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:39,010
What's over there though?

2409
01:57:40,650 --> 01:57:41,170
Nothing?

2410
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:44,810
What the fuck is that there for?

2411
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,530
Why is it there?

2412
01:57:54,490 --> 01:57:55,910
Okay, I'll go this way then.

2413
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:01,800
Iron leaves.

2414
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,440
Oh, I see.

2415
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,080
I see.

2416
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,080
I see.

2417
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,540
Because why not?

2418
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:13,880
Okay.

2419
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,400
Alright, guys.

2420
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:18,440
Uh...

2421
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,720
Did they upgrade my gourd?

2422
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:21,120
Is this my gourd now?

2423
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:25,160
Did he make it into a supreme gourd?

2424
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,420
I don't even know what he did.

2425
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,160
What the fuck did he do to my thing?

2426
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:34,630
Is that what he did?

2427
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:35,670
I can't tell.

2428
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:40,880
Each sip...

2429
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:41,200
Yeah.

2430
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:42,980
I mean, it's the same thing.

2431
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,580
Oh, it went from 9 to 10!

2432
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:46,180
Oh!

2433
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:47,400
Okay.

2434
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:51,420
I didn't even realize I had 10 sips now.

2435
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:53,660
Alright.

2436
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:54,200
Up I go.

2437
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:57,900
Hello, guys.

2438
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:06,220
Oh, hey!

2439
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:07,140
The cicada!

2440
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:14,950
Oh, I can be a cicada again?

2441
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,560
You don't even love your husband?

2442
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:40,940
You don't even love your husband?

2443
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:41,940
You don't even love your husband?

2444
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:49,660
See, she's a better wife than the other goth spider lady, because she has less polygons.

2445
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:59,260
You can tell how this hot lady has less polygons compared to the gothic spider lady.

2446
01:59:59,540 --> 01:59:59,920
compared to the gothic spider lady.

2447
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:04,960
I think you just want to trick the cicada into being a human.

2448
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,600
Because I'm not lagging anymore in cutscenes.

2449
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:10,560
You are the father's new flesh and bone.

2450
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:12,860
Thank you, mother, for being so generous.

2451
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:19,680
No matter how good my brother is to me, he can't compare to the divine grace of two families.

2452
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:24,420
I've already decided about the cicada.

2453
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,500
Mom, please, we gotta help father!

2454
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:36,620
Who is he?

2455
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:40,840
...

2456
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,680
Who is he?

2457
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:44,280
...

2458
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,120
Who is he?

2459
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,500
...

2460
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:47,320
...

2461
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:49,060
That's me!

2462
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,000
Not lady!

2463
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,820
Not lady!

2464
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,200
Who is he?

2465
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,840
That's not a lady!

2466
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:03,040
...

2467
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:12,000
...

2468
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,720
...

2469
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:12,780
...

2470
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:19,360
...

2471
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,040
...

2472
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:20,060
...

2473
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:20,920
...

2474
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,340
...

2475
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:23,180
Oh shit, you're right!

2476
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,900
Because her fat is more strong than me in the old Wukong.

2477
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:28,220
...

2478
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:32,190
...

2479
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,000
...

2480
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:35,140
...

2481
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:36,240
...

2482
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:36,280
...

2483
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:37,620
...

2484
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:37,640
...

2485
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,580
...

2486
02:01:58,100 --> 02:01:58,700
...

2487
02:01:59,340 --> 02:01:59,940
...

2488
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:01,740
...

2489
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:04,560
...

2490
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:04,580
...

2491
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,720
Why don't you want me back?

2492
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:09,880
I heard Wukong is pretty funny.

2493
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:10,400
...

2494
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:15,380
I mean, aside from all the murder, just don't piss him off.

2495
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:15,980
...

2496
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:16,800
...

2497
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:22,380
Oh, he's the other man!

2498
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,280
...

2499
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:26,200
The bull is not gonna be happy!

2500
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:27,400
...

2501
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,440
...

2502
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,680
...

2503
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,300
...

2504
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:36,500
She cheated on her bull husband!

2505
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:38,580
...

2506
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,580
...

2507
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:41,360
...

2508
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:43,700
...

2509
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:44,580
...

2510
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,560
He's the boy toy!

2511
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:51,680
...

2512
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:58,200
A child of a concubine should know better!

2513
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,060
...

2514
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:02,880
A child of a concubine should know better!

2515
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:06,740
Oh my god!

2516
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:11,940
But he's hot though, daddy!

2517
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:12,860
...

2518
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,940
Oh my god!

2519
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:17,720
Can't believe the bull got NTR'd!

2520
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:18,480
...

2521
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,260
I thought I was getting NTR'd!

2522
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:22,620
Oh thank god, she's still mine!

2523
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:26,240
Oh thank god, the hot fox lady is still mine!

2524
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:27,140
...

2525
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:27,360
...

2526
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:30,780
...

2527
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:34,060
It's only the bull king that's getting NTR'd, not me!

2528
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:35,340
...

2529
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:36,880
...

2530
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:38,640
...

2531
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:39,700
...

2532
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:41,560
...

2533
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:41,620
...

2534
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:43,660
...

2535
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:46,920
...

2536
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:49,180
...

2537
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:50,380
Is that the bull king?

2538
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:50,980
...

2539
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:52,000
...

2540
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,020
...

2541
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:57,700
Oh shit!

2542
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,800
Oh my god!

2543
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:01,300
Reverse so cock!

2544
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:03,340
...

2545
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:03,460
...

2546
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,700
...

2547
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:06,900
...

2548
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:16,220
Oh my god!

2549
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,040
Reverse so cock!

2550
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:23,720
...

2551
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,340
...

2552
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:24,820
...

2553
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:25,040
...

2554
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,440
...

2555
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:28,700
...

2556
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,640
...

2557
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:33,180
...

2558
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:35,400
Oh my god, what a plot twist!

2559
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:36,860
I am watching a telenova.

2560
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,860
The keeper of the flaming mountains.

2561
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:42,880
Peacock pranks.

2562
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:49,560
What the hell?

2563
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:50,620
What's this?

2564
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:00,100
I thought we're friends!

2565
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:01,320
Why can't we...

2566
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:01,540
What?

2567
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:03,380
How did you...

2568
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:04,020
What?

2569
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,280
What the fuck?

2570
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,140
No!

2571
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:07,680
I don't wanna read!

2572
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:12,240
No!

2573
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,920
Don't make me read!

2574
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,420
Don't do it!

2575
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:22,000
Guys, he's trying to force me to read, guys!

2576
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:26,540
Guys, I don't wanna read!

2577
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:28,960
Where is he?

2578
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:30,860
What do I do?

2579
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,480
Am I supposed to fight these guys?

2580
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,180
Oh, I guess I am.

2581
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,820
No, he's trying to kill me with words!

2582
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,160
My one weakness!

2583
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:41,980
I am a whore!

2584
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:46,180
Guys, he's trying to kill me with words!

2585
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:49,000
What do I do?

2586
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,560
Okay.

2587
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,200
Words that kill.

2588
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:01,180
Oh no, I can't believe this.

2589
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,280
I'm so fucked up, he's trying to kill me with words right now.

2590
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,020
Not calligraphy!

2591
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:09,020
No!

2592
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:12,980
Get educated!

2593
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:15,960
How does he know I can't read!

2594
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:18,720
In any language!

2595
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:22,520
Alright, nice.

2596
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,020
Okay, we got him.

2597
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:27,240
We got him, sir.

2598
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:30,640
Okay, nice.

2599
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:32,640
Okay.

2600
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,040
Nice, alright.

2601
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:37,940
What the fuck, where did he go?

2602
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:40,100
That's fucking right.

2603
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:41,340
That's where I am!

2604
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:42,940
No, don't you dare!

2605
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:44,140
Oh, thank god!

2606
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:44,440
Okay.

2607
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:46,140
My final form.

2608
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,620
That's right, I'm coming over.

2609
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:50,340
That's right.

2610
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:51,920
Oh, shit!

2611
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,800
Okay, that's fine.

2612
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:53,260
That's fine.

2613
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:54,260
Where is he?

2614
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:55,340
That is not fine.

2615
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:56,160
Okay, guys.

2616
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:56,740
Please.

2617
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,220
Please.

2618
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:58,520
Please!

2619
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,280
Get down!

2620
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:05,120
Okay.

2621
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:06,500
That's fine.

2622
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:07,840
Boom.

2623
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:08,940
And then...

2624
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:09,820
Not fine.

2625
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:10,640
But that's okay.

2626
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,660
This is not okay.

2627
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:13,580
But that's fine.

2628
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,540
Bro, why is he so fucking far?

2629
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:19,440
This should be illegal!

2630
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:21,740
Are you serious?

2631
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:23,140
It's him!

2632
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:24,820
Wait!

2633
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,180
That's him!

2634
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:26,860
Bro!

2635
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:27,200
Bro!

2636
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:28,360
I'm...

2637
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:28,940
Oh my god!

2638
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:32,160
Oh!

2639
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:32,260
Hurry!

2640
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:32,860
NO!

2641
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:33,680
NONO!

2642
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,060
NONONO!

2643
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,280
Oh my god!

2644
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:37,580
That's him!

2645
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:41,380
Oh my god!

2646
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:41,720
It's him!

2647
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:43,260
No.

2648
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:44,360
We weren't buddies.

2649
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:46,260
We weren't buddies.

2650
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:48,740
Chib- Help!

2651
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:53,380
His big tanky body is distracting me!

2652
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:54,800
Ah-ha!

2653
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,120
Ha-ha!

2654
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:55,820
Ha-ha!

2655
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,040
Ha-ha!

2656
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:01,860
Okay, we're fine.

2657
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:04,760
Bro, we're getting wet.

2658
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:12,880
Bro, it's like, they like put oil on him.

2659
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:16,020
I can't even think about it.

2660
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,300
Look, he's just horsing around.

2661
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:22,300
Look at him glisten.

2662
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:24,240
Nice.

2663
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:24,240
Look at this.

2664
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:27,280
And he's free now.

2665
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:30,000
He's free!

2666
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,280
Be free!

2667
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,740
He's on the hot oil now.

2668
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:39,460
With a whip.

2669
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:42,820
Good night, sweet prince.

2670
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,220
Yin Yang fish?

2671
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,480
I thought they were nice.

2672
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,040
Quick!

2673
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,040
Ju Bacca, turn into a catfish!

2674
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:57,440
Oh, is he gonna get eaten by a fish?

2675
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,200
What's going on?

2676
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,540
I thought there was supposed to be two of them.

2677
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:12,660
If it's a Yin Yang fish.

2678
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,140
Oh my god.

2679
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,080
Which one's Yin Yang?

2680
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:23,260
Is that... I thought it was supposed to be two.

2681
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:30,240
Oh, nope.

2682
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:31,560
It's just one big one.

2683
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:33,700
Do I have to kill another one?

2684
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:35,740
Oh my god.

2685
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,520
Wait, what happened?

2686
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:37,420
Did he get eaten?

2687
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:38,980
Ju Bacca!

2688
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:43,460
Are you so... How did you get fucking eaten?

2689
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,940
You're literally a fish!

2690
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:46,720
Sometimes!

2691
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:52,500
How did you get eaten?

2692
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:54,200
You can turn into a fish!

2693
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:58,020
Okay.

2694
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:03,660
He's got... Bro, how the fuck?

2695
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:06,100
How the fuck did he get eaten?

2696
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:07,500
I don't understand!

2697
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:11,240
Oh my god.

2698
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:15,880
That catfish got eaten by a bigger catfish.

2699
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,440
Like, he could just... He could just turn into a fish!

2700
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:20,960
What's the point?

2701
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:25,360
What's the point of having fish powers if you don't use them?

2702
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:27,480
Jesus Christ.

2703
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:29,160
Oh, just take everything.

2704
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:31,200
What the fuck?

2705
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:33,280
You can't dodge that, chat!

2706
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,960
Like, oh and then we're at the Yang!

2707
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:36,980
Oh, okay.

2708
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:37,720
That makes sense.

2709
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,660
That was crazy.

2710
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:40,360
I couldn't dodge that at all.

2711
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:44,380
I literally just took every fucking hit there.

2712
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:46,420
That's actually crazy.

2713
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:49,000
Holy fuck.

2714
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:51,180
Okay.

2715
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:53,740
Oh fuck!

2716
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:54,180
Okay.

2717
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:54,920
Big baby.

2718
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,360
Did I hit him?

2719
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,440
Thank god I did.

2720
02:10:58,760 --> 02:10:59,360
Alright.

2721
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:03,920
Oh, not again!

2722
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:05,980
Not again!

2723
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:08,280
Oh!

2724
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,020
Wait, a fish just slapped me.

2725
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,100
Jesus Christ!

2726
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:17,800
Okay, this fish is very annoying.

2727
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,400
Oh, this is bad.

2728
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,240
Like a what?

2729
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:25,860
What do I?

2730
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:27,300
Oh, it's the fucking...

2731
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:27,980
Oh!

2732
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:29,080
It's V!

2733
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,080
It's V!

2734
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:31,440
I forgot about V!

2735
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:34,620
I forgot about that other move!

2736
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,920
Guys, I never remember the...

2737
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:42,480
Because I haven't used the staff spin in so long.

2738
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:47,140
Chat, like, I actually don't use that move.

2739
02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:50,720
So I literally forgot about my second move.

2740
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,200
Oh my god, this thing moves.

2741
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,640
I was like...

2742
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:57,480
Oh my god.

2743
02:11:58,300 --> 02:12:00,320
Because I'm moving shit!

2744
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:03,080
No, it's never useful.

2745
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:09,220
Other than this one time where I have to actually use it.

2746
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:12,840
It's never useful.

2747
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:17,100
The one time it's fucking useful.

2748
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:20,540
Okay.

2749
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:22,180
I'm gonna make sure I'm fully healed.

2750
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:24,220
Okay.

2751
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:28,340
Get over here.

2752
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:30,420
Get your ass over here!

2753
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:32,600
Oh my god!

2754
02:12:32,740 --> 02:12:32,940
Oh!

2755
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:36,760
That's fine.

2756
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:38,880
I'm gonna make sure I recharge.

2757
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:40,680
And then...

2758
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:41,440
Boom!

2759
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:43,140
Alright.

2760
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:45,300
That's fine.

2761
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:46,880
Yeah, that's fucking right.

2762
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,160
Run!

2763
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:48,920
Oh, fuck!

2764
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:49,280
Okay.

2765
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:49,460
Okay.

2766
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:50,680
Okay, I...

2767
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,880
I know my mistake.

2768
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:54,300
I'm sorry for calling you a bad fish.

2769
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:55,720
Okay.

2770
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:56,960
That's fine.

2771
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:58,020
I can do this.

2772
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:01,060
Oh, it's literally...

2773
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:01,780
One hit!

2774
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:02,140
Nice!

2775
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:04,400
Keeper of...

2776
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,260
Oh, I defeated him?

2777
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:10,840
Nice.

2778
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:17,400
Oh my god, flashbang.

2779
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:18,680
Oh my god, why is it so white?

2780
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:20,140
Oh, my eyes.

2781
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:21,660
Stop!

2782
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:31,170
The flashbang fucking sucked.

2783
02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:44,730
What happened?

2784
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:46,250
How did he get corrupted?

2785
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,350
Wait, by me?

2786
02:13:48,630 --> 02:13:49,650
I did that?

2787
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,910
Call for the wrong woman?

2788
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:56,970
Yeah, but...

2789
02:13:56,970 --> 02:13:58,970
He wanted to take advantage of her.

2790
02:13:59,890 --> 02:13:59,930
Yeah.

2791
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:01,550
From here, go.

2792
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:03,050
See if there's a way in.

2793
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:05,290
I'll go look everywhere.

2794
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:09,610
Although my mother ran away, I can't say that my love's still in the mountain.

2795
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:11,610
Oh, he's gone now.

2796
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:12,390
Wait, what?

2797
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:14,050
He's gonna leave me here after that?

2798
02:14:14,810 --> 02:14:15,650
What the fuck?

2799
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:20,170
Alright, let's go grab his stuff.

2800
02:14:20,490 --> 02:14:21,590
It's my stuff now.

2801
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:22,370
Okay.

2802
02:14:23,290 --> 02:14:23,810
Nice.

2803
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:26,670
Oh, I got a robe!

2804
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:29,410
And I got a long bomb.

2805
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:32,810
Okay, and then I go back downstairs for the horse, right?

2806
02:14:35,850 --> 02:14:36,370
What?

2807
02:14:36,430 --> 02:14:37,290
What's that sound?

2808
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:38,990
Oh, it's the portrait!

2809
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:41,390
It's him!

2810
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:44,470
How did you become evil?

2811
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:51,790
For him to marry a young Yo-Gai king and though he felt a bit melancholic, he understood that he was ultimately unworthy of her.

2812
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:57,710
No matter how many dirty tasks he had done for the master, in the master's eyes, he would never be a match for her.

2813
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:02,810
Yeah, you're right.

2814
02:15:04,010 --> 02:15:04,830
No, he's right.

2815
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:07,330
You'll never be good for her.

2816
02:15:09,790 --> 02:15:11,250
And I agree.

2817
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:14,570
Hahaha!

2818
02:15:18,710 --> 02:15:20,930
Wait, how do I go downstairs?

2819
02:15:21,170 --> 02:15:22,130
Where was it?

2820
02:15:22,230 --> 02:15:22,710
Here, right?

2821
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:22,970
Yeah.

2822
02:15:24,730 --> 02:15:25,210
Damn!

2823
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:27,470
I can see it!

2824
02:15:27,470 --> 02:15:28,730
This man tried to kill me!

2825
02:15:32,530 --> 02:15:34,090
I can see it!

2826
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:35,310
This poor guy.

2827
02:15:35,530 --> 02:15:36,710
He even got catfished too.

2828
02:15:37,690 --> 02:15:38,850
This poor fucker.

2829
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:43,390
Now I need to go to the horse thing, right?

2830
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:46,850
Oh.

2831
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:52,170
Considerably increases damage executed by the next attack.

2832
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:56,270
I feel like the mana is just too good though.

2833
02:15:56,770 --> 02:16:02,250
Like, yeah, I can get more attack, but the mana increase is like...

2834
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:04,330
really good.

2835
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:07,470
Uhhh...

2836
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:13,670
Yeah, I use the spells a lot too.

2837
02:16:16,610 --> 02:16:18,350
Horse soaks dope, but the mana!

2838
02:16:26,690 --> 02:16:29,050
Yeah, I feel like the mana is just really good.

2839
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:34,490
Um, alright, which way was the... where do I have to go for the...

2840
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:36,070
The horse?

2841
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:36,650
Oh, there he is!

2842
02:16:36,710 --> 02:16:37,230
Valley entrance.

2843
02:16:38,370 --> 02:16:39,670
Can I talk to the guy now?

2844
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:40,210
Or no?

2845
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:43,010
Can I talk to the bull?

2846
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:46,610
The horse?

2847
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:47,090
Sorry, the horse?

2848
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:47,370
The horse?

2849
02:16:49,310 --> 02:16:50,890
I'm allowed to talk to him now?

2850
02:16:52,670 --> 02:16:53,150
Yeah?

2851
02:16:53,250 --> 02:16:53,950
Okay, I'll head over.

2852
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:56,150
Alright, guys.

2853
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:59,690
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of these guys first.

2854
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:02,170
I don't wanna deal with...

2855
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:04,390
Oh, I don't wanna deal with him.

2856
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:08,330
Wait, I think I have like... stances, right?

2857
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:09,470
Three, okay, I do.

2858
02:17:09,830 --> 02:17:11,250
I'm gonna upgrade my cloud.

2859
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:14,770
Uhhh...

2860
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:17,930
Let me... Oh, that's actually really good!

2861
02:17:19,850 --> 02:17:21,130
I don't use pluck.

2862
02:17:22,330 --> 02:17:25,250
I realized I never use pluck anyway.

2863
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:26,410
Okay.

2864
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:32,470
Actually, I can leave this guy.

2865
02:17:33,210 --> 02:17:34,110
He don't matter.

2866
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:35,890
I can just run past all of them.

2867
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:37,790
They don't matter.

2868
02:17:43,310 --> 02:17:43,910
Alright.

2869
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:44,090
Alright.

2870
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:46,370
Goodbye.

2871
02:17:46,710 --> 02:17:47,490
Wait, are these women?

2872
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:52,630
Are they like...

2873
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:53,010
Oh!

2874
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:54,450
That's why!

2875
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:57,790
That's why they're cheeked up!

2876
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:05,280
Alright, so we go this way.

2877
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:10,280
Yeah, somebody said the lore of them was they got pulled into the lava.

2878
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:15,740
Somebody said like, oh, they got pulled into the lava and then like turned into stone.

2879
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,900
I was like, that's sad.

2880
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:23,870
Get rid of these guys first.

2881
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:26,030
Wait, they're like snakes with heads.

2882
02:18:26,610 --> 02:18:27,930
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of...

2883
02:18:30,930 --> 02:18:31,850
I'm trying!

2884
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:33,250
Horseman!

2885
02:18:33,410 --> 02:18:35,150
There's just so many snakes!

2886
02:18:35,490 --> 02:18:36,050
Snakes!

2887
02:18:36,570 --> 02:18:38,510
There's so many lava snakes!

2888
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:41,670
I'm trying my best to get to you!

2889
02:18:45,010 --> 02:18:46,050
Okay, nice.

2890
02:18:46,710 --> 02:18:48,910
I'm trying my best to get to you!

2891
02:18:51,070 --> 02:18:52,790
There's just a lot of snakes!

2892
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:55,150
Okay, nice.

2893
02:18:55,210 --> 02:18:55,990
He's almost dead.

2894
02:18:58,390 --> 02:18:58,850
Alright.

2895
02:18:59,370 --> 02:18:59,830
Easy.

2896
02:19:00,430 --> 02:19:03,070
Okay, and then get rid of the lava snakes real quick.

2897
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:05,750
And then stop, drop, and roll.

2898
02:19:05,890 --> 02:19:06,750
Stop, drop, and roll.

2899
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:07,990
Alright.

2900
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:10,490
Boom!

2901
02:19:11,590 --> 02:19:12,050
Alright.

2902
02:19:12,530 --> 02:19:14,470
Oh my god, is that some cold iron leaves?

2903
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:15,370
My fucking favorite.

2904
02:19:15,450 --> 02:19:16,070
Can I pull again?

2905
02:19:16,470 --> 02:19:17,510
Am I allowed to pull?

2906
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:18,390
Chat?

2907
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:22,010
Am I allowed to pull his whip?

2908
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:24,470
Okay.

2909
02:19:25,870 --> 02:19:31,610
You're waiting for me?

2910
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:33,650
It's mine!

2911
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:39,670
We were here for so long.

2912
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:46,770
In darkness, cunning, charged, doff brew, slow of step, transform into a horse-quack, immune to thunder damage.

2913
02:19:46,770 --> 02:19:48,570
Oh my god, I can become him!

2914
02:19:49,530 --> 02:19:51,110
Oh my god, finally.

2915
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:55,850
I shall be him now.

2916
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:01,910
Now I'm the jacked up horse.

2917
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:05,290
How hungry.

2918
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:08,850
Okay, but which one's better though?

2919
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:10,870
The yellow dragon or...

2920
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:12,110
The yellow...

2921
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:13,870
Yellow dragon?

2922
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:15,010
Or...

2923
02:20:15,430 --> 02:20:15,850
Or...

2924
02:20:15,850 --> 02:20:17,370
Or, uh...

2925
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:18,190
Or him.

2926
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:20,210
Guys, which one's better?

2927
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:21,330
I don't know which one.

2928
02:20:21,690 --> 02:20:22,790
Ma or...

2929
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:23,350
Oh, I can read this.

2930
02:20:23,410 --> 02:20:23,810
This is horse.

2931
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:26,670
Is yellow dragon or...

2932
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:26,930
Oh.

2933
02:20:27,730 --> 02:20:30,150
Yellow dragon is much better if you can parry?

2934
02:20:30,390 --> 02:20:31,730
Well, okay then.

2935
02:20:31,950 --> 02:20:32,390
Alright.

2936
02:20:32,470 --> 02:20:34,630
Because I can't parry, which one's better?

2937
02:20:35,630 --> 02:20:36,670
Yellow dragon...

2938
02:20:36,670 --> 02:20:36,870
I'm sorry.

2939
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:37,870
Horse or tiger?

2940
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:39,990
Yes.

2941
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:43,310
Guys, because I can't parry, which one's better?

2942
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:45,310
The tiger or the horse?

2943
02:20:55,060 --> 02:20:57,760
Girl, just learn to parry.

2944
02:20:58,440 --> 02:20:59,620
Okay, let's see.

2945
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:00,880
What does this look like?

2946
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:05,060
Oh, my thing has any rest, I think.

2947
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,140
Horse, okay.

2948
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:11,720
Oh, I should talk to the bull guy?

2949
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,060
Okay, let's see.

2950
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:18,360
Hey, what does he do?

2951
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:24,640
Okay, that's right.

2952
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:28,380
Who's been a baaad gwaaaay?

2953
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:34,690
Have you been a baaad gwaaaay?

2954
02:21:38,770 --> 02:21:39,810
Stop.

2955
02:21:42,490 --> 02:21:44,390
Horse's home...

2956
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:48,430
This is really bad.

2957
02:21:48,430 --> 02:21:49,710
STOOOOP!

2958
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:52,510
Let me...

2959
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:54,230
Okay.

2960
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:56,350
Alright.

2961
02:21:57,070 --> 02:22:00,770
Let me... let me go...

2962
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:01,930
and see...

2963
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:02,970
What was his name?

2964
02:22:03,130 --> 02:22:03,990
This guy.

2965
02:22:05,010 --> 02:22:05,470
Okay.

2966
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:07,290
Stop!

2967
02:22:10,530 --> 02:22:11,470
Alright.

2968
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:16,570
Where's the other... the guy that talked to you?

2969
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,630
I'm tearing...

2970
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:21,650
Bro, he's dead.

2971
02:22:21,730 --> 02:22:24,270
Why did you defile his legacy?

2972
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:27,410
Where is he?

2973
02:22:27,610 --> 02:22:28,430
Where's the guy?

2974
02:22:28,930 --> 02:22:29,710
Where's the...

2975
02:22:29,710 --> 02:22:30,810
Oh, there he is.

2976
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:31,790
Hey, your friend's dead.

2977
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:34,990
The horse your friend, right?

2978
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:38,790
What the horse would have wanted?

2979
02:22:39,790 --> 02:22:41,650
Hey, I'm here to tell you he's dead.

2980
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:43,350
But don't worry, I can beat him.

2981
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:49,370
I'll bring some more cigarettes.

2982
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:51,430
Let me kill him before he's dead.

2983
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:53,930
I have to turn into him to talk to him?

2984
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:54,170
Listen.

2985
02:22:54,790 --> 02:22:58,930
The five-star car that Hong Hai'er drove is a trick of the eye.

2986
02:22:59,650 --> 02:23:00,730
You have to be smart.

2987
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:02,210
Pfft!

2988
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:04,810
Little bastard.

2989
02:23:06,850 --> 02:23:08,210
You go up the mountain quickly.

2990
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:11,770
I want to see what he sells in the lake.

2991
02:23:12,770 --> 02:23:13,330
Hmph!

2992
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:14,970
Hmph!

2993
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:17,490
Hey.

2994
02:23:19,350 --> 02:23:20,410
Five-star car.

2995
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:21,310
Five-star car.

2996
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:22,710
That must be a five-star car.

2997
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:24,670
How many did you get?

2998
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:25,410
How many did I get?

2999
02:23:25,650 --> 02:23:26,970
I think I got three?

3000
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:33,650
Oh, he's going to help me.

3001
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:41,870
Yeah, I only got three.

3002
02:23:45,310 --> 02:23:47,170
Yeah, so we're still missing one more.

3003
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:53,030
Did I have to talk to him again when I get the last car?

3004
02:23:58,670 --> 02:23:59,910
Oh, now I have to go back.

3005
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:00,310
Okay.

3006
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:02,670
Okay, I have to go back now.

3007
02:24:04,970 --> 02:24:06,730
Yeah, so we're missing one more.

3008
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:08,450
Okay, let's go back.

3009
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:10,770
Uh...

3010
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:12,190
Flaming Mountains.

3011
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:13,490
The Emerald Hall.

3012
02:24:13,710 --> 02:24:14,830
That should be where we're going.

3013
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:19,480
No, it's one more.

3014
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:21,340
Because the horse got the other one.

3015
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:22,920
Because I got...

3016
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:24,800
No, I got two, right?

3017
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:25,560
Oh, I got two!

3018
02:24:27,460 --> 02:24:28,280
Did I get two?

3019
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:30,640
And then he got one, right?

3020
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:32,520
Did I get two or three?

3021
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:33,160
I can't remember.

3022
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:38,320
I think I got two.

3023
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,280
So I have two more to go.

3024
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:41,440
Yeah, two more to go.

3025
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:43,380
Alright, that's alright.

3026
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:44,020
I can meditate.

3027
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:47,040
Alright.

3028
02:24:56,660 --> 02:24:58,240
Now I'm the horsey.

3029
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:00,680
Now I'm the horsey.

3030
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:07,320
See?

3031
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:07,780
See?

3032
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:08,600
See?

3033
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:09,780
See?

3034
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:12,040
What?

3035
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:12,920
What?

3036
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:13,820
What?

3037
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:19,240
I'm gonna make the I'm gonna make the cry snake.

3038
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,200
Stop!

3039
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:37,400
Alright, which way do I go?

3040
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:39,300
I guess I go left side.

3041
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:44,720
Now I have true power!

3042
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,240
Where the fuck do I go?

3043
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:50,820
Like, where am I?

3044
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:56,060
Oh my god, wait, I have a fucking air attack?

3045
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:57,640
What the fuck?

3046
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:58,840
When am I gonna use this?

3047
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:00,300
What the fuck?

3048
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:07,520
Guys, I After eight playthroughs I discovered a fucking new move.

3049
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:09,220
Oh, I passed an item?

3050
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:11,840
Where?

3051
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:14,960
Where would an item be?

3052
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:18,280
This area is so fucking hard to navigate.

3053
02:26:20,820 --> 02:26:25,060
I guess it only took us eight playthroughs.

3054
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:26,280
Up the stairs?

3055
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,360
Oh, this one?

3056
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:31,800
I already got all the items.

3057
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:35,600
Yeah, I was going.

3058
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:36,980
I was gonna go up the stairs.

3059
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:40,460
Here?

3060
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:40,800
No.

3061
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,680
Oh, it's below!

3062
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:47,740
Can I go down here?

3063
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:48,280
No, okay.

3064
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:51,140
Okay, left hand side, alright.

3065
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,820
Alright, let's go.

3066
02:26:56,520 --> 02:26:58,300
Oh, my stamina is low now.

3067
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:00,820
Here?

3068
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:03,860
What is this music?

3069
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:04,760
Whoa.

3070
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:07,540
Oh, it must be in here cause there's water.

3071
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:12,840
Wait, this is the right.

3072
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:17,320
I was just like Wait a minute.

3073
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:19,180
That's the right hand side.

3074
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:24,500
I just noticed I was going the wrong way.

3075
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:27,580
Where is it?

3076
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:31,800
The other side.

3077
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:37,640
At the outer region?

3078
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:38,560
Oh, this way.

3079
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:41,160
Oh, it's not in water?

3080
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:42,280
Oh, my god.

3081
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:46,040
It's like chat plays Wukong.

3082
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,900
Oh, so it should be here then.

3083
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:51,960
And that's the meditation.

3084
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:54,420
That's where I meditated.

3085
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:00,420
That's where I meditated.

3086
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,280
It's beside the stairs.

3087
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:09,270
Face the throne and turn left.

3088
02:28:09,810 --> 02:28:11,010

02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:20,660
Is it behind me?

3127
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:21,520
Is it in front of me?

3128
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:22,700

02:31:48,790 --> 02:31:49,750
I was going to say.

3158
02:31:49,830 --> 02:31:51,190
I was like, hey, I swear to God.

3159
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:53,270
If this is another.

3160
02:31:53,430 --> 02:31:56,810
You made me do all of that for fucking cold iron leaves.

3161
02:31:56,950 --> 02:31:58,150
I swear to God.

3162

Like Okay.

3163
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:03,470
Oh good.

3164
02:32:03,590 --> 02:32:04,210
They heard it.

3165
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:05,090
His own teammate.

3166
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:06,910
That's good.

3167
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:07,170
That's good.

3168
02:32:08,850 --> 02:32:11,510
What the fuck is that coming from though?

3169
02:32:12,410 --> 02:32:15,130
Wait, do I go down or up?

3170
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:18,010
Oh, I can't even go down.

3171
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:19,690
I have only up.

3172
02:32:22,090 --> 02:32:23,950
I hear somebody snoring.

3173
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:25,150
Is that the Bull King?

3174
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:27,170
Is he?

3175
02:32:27,170 --> 02:32:27,930
Is he EP?

3176
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:30,910
Mr. Bull King?

3177
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:32,370
Are you EP right now?

3178
02:32:34,810 --> 02:32:35,350
Whoa!

3179
02:32:35,530 --> 02:32:39,310

3180
02:32:39,610 --> 02:32:40,270

3181
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:41,090
Night.

3182
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:44,250
Morning.

3183
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:45,170
Night.

3184
02:32:50,030 --> 02:32:52,230
I control the sun.

3185
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:54,250
Let's fucking go.

3186
02:32:54,290 --> 02:32:55,090
Oh, there he is.

3187
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:57,090
Wait, is that friend?

3188
02:32:57,350 --> 02:32:58,090
Oh, it is friend.

3189
02:32:59,770 --> 02:33:01,690
I control the sun.

3190
02:33:02,490 --> 02:33:03,850
Oh, it's the Bull!

3191
02:33:05,830 --> 02:33:09,090
Okay, we got to make sure he doesn't die like his horse friend.

3192
02:33:10,970 --> 02:33:12,070
Alright, nice.

3193
02:33:12,170 --> 02:33:12,750
It's fine.

3194
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:14,110
Is he going to run me over?

3195
02:33:14,270 --> 02:33:15,030
Holy shit!

3196
02:33:15,070 --> 02:33:16,430

02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:26,990
He backed up onto me!

3200
02:33:27,050 --> 02:33:27,790
That's so fucked!

3201
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:32,090
It's become worse.

3202
02:33:32,650 --> 02:33:33,570
The timing.

3203
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:36,330
I didn't think I was going to get ran over!

3204
02:33:37,150 --> 02:33:37,590
Like...

3205
02:33:39,250 --> 02:33:39,970
This is it.

3206
02:33:40,610 --> 02:33:41,770
Oh my God.

3207
02:33:41,810 --> 02:33:42,610
No, no, no, no.

3208
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:43,710
I need a heal.

3209
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:45,770
Guys, I know what to do.

3210
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:47,270
It's not going to be weird for him.

3211
02:33:47,970 --> 02:33:48,730

02:33:58,630 --> 02:33:59,270
That's right.

3217
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:02,170
Who's been a naughty cart?

3218
02:34:08,030 --> 02:34:09,150

Guys, it's not weird.

3222
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:17,110
Don't make it weird, guys.

3223
02:34:18,830 --> 02:34:20,370
Guys, it wasn't weird.

3224
02:34:20,430 --> 02:34:21,270
Don't make it weird.

3225
02:34:23,470 --> 02:34:24,030
Yeah!

3226
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:26,690
We did it!

3227
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:30,230

3228
02:34:32,170 --> 02:34:32,910
That was a great fight!

3229
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:34,410
He enjoyed it!

3230
02:34:37,980 --> 02:34:40,030
Guys, he enjoyed it!

3231
02:34:50,290 --> 02:34:52,930

Hahaha!

3233
02:34:55,230 --> 02:34:55,830

02:34:56,370 --> 02:34:56,870
Hahaha!

3235
02:34:57,330 --> 02:34:58,190
Hahaha!

3236
02:34:58,190 --> 02:34:58,290
What the fuck!

3237
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:04,430
He was part of it.

3238
02:35:04,490 --> 02:35:05,150
What do you mean watching?

3239
02:35:08,390 --> 02:35:10,670
Wait, wait where is he!?

3240
02:35:16,290 --> 02:35:17,370

3241
02:35:17,370 --> 02:35:17,390

02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:35,170
Yeah, how could it just disappear?

3245
02:35:37,690 --> 02:35:39,750
What the fuck is the Bishu beast?

3246
02:35:41,770 --> 02:35:43,350
I like Toki.

3247
02:35:43,470 --> 02:35:44,070
I'm not blind!

3248
02:35:44,430 --> 02:35:46,010
I just choose not to see.

3249
02:35:46,610 --> 02:35:47,550
It's a choice.

3250
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:49,250
It might be worse, but it's a choice.

3251
02:35:53,070 --> 02:35:55,230
It might be worse, but it's a choice.

3252
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:57,010
A duck!

3253
02:35:57,090 --> 02:35:58,030

Alright, here we go.

3260
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:19,700
Oh wait, Brapo messaged me about something.

3261
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:27,220
He wanted to quote retweet me about something.

3262
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:28,780
About the lag.

3263
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:38,460
Alright, here we go.

3264
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:44,600
Alright, get out of here.

3265
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:46,960
Get your ass out of here.

3266
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:48,880
Why did he message me that?

3267
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:49,820
Am I like...

3268
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:52,960
An hour ago?

3269
02:36:52,980 --> 02:36:53,940
Oh, two hours ago.

3270
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:54,320
Whoops.

3271
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:57,400
Two hours ago.

3272
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:02,840
Oh wait, get out of here.

3273
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:12,240
Who said that?

3274
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:14,700
Fucking...

3275
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:19,600
Wolf, I'm not reading that.

3276
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:22,880
Wolf, I'm not...

3277
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:27,620
I am absolutely not reading that.

3278
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:27,780
Thank you for the super chat.

3279
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:29,080
For this guy deserves to be first.

3280
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,420
Thank you for the super chat.

3281
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:32,580
Thank you, thank you.

3282
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,000
What the fuck, you're dead!

3283
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:41,680
Wait, oh okay, reload.

3284
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:44,440
Alright.

3285
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:47,620
Up we go.

3286
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,300
Is that the Bull King that's like groaning?

3287
02:37:51,100 --> 02:37:52,960
Don't worry, of course she's coming.

3288
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:57,440
Don't worry, of course she's coming.

3289
02:37:57,440 --> 02:37:57,580
Don't worry, of course she's coming.

3290
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:04,620
I'm not going to repeat myself.

3291
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:05,480
I realized what I said.

3292
02:38:05,620 --> 02:38:07,620
I'm like, I'm not repeating myself.

3293
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:10,740
Alright, here we go.

3294
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:12,540
Go this way.

3295
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:20,170
Yay, the shrine time.

3296
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:22,130
I need to rest up.

3297
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:25,250
Is there anything here?

3298
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:27,610
What is this?

3299
02:38:28,810 --> 02:38:33,590
After using moderate reduces cooldown for all spells but impairs movement.

3300
02:38:33,830 --> 02:38:35,950
Why the fuck would I debuff myself?

3301
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:39,450
It's like, impairs movement.

3302
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:40,310
Like, what?

3303
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:42,990
Oh no, it's an open area.

3304
02:38:43,390 --> 02:38:45,050
Oh no, my worst enemy.

3305
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:48,610
Okay, obviously we're not going to...

3306
02:38:50,890 --> 02:38:52,070
We're going to go this way.

3307
02:38:55,190 --> 02:38:57,250
There's a boss there in this open area.

3308
02:38:57,250 --> 02:38:59,010
I mean, that would make sense.

3309
02:38:59,130 --> 02:39:00,310
I was like...

3310
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:03,430
It feels like there's a mini-boss right here.

3311
02:39:03,970 --> 02:39:04,990
Which one do I...

3312
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:07,270
I assume I picked this mushroom right here.

3313
02:39:07,350 --> 02:39:08,210
The red mushroom.

3314
02:39:08,670 --> 02:39:10,450
Yeah, I had a feeling.

3315
02:39:10,890 --> 02:39:11,830
I had...

3316
02:39:11,830 --> 02:39:15,230
Oh my god, I had a feeling it was the red mushroom.

3317
02:39:15,990 --> 02:39:20,650
I was like, which mushroom seems like the most special of all the mushrooms?

3318
02:39:20,830 --> 02:39:23,730
The surrounding orange mushroom or the...

3319
02:39:24,250 --> 02:39:27,150
Or the red mushroom standing all by himself?

3320
02:39:27,150 --> 02:39:27,970
Right here.

3321
02:39:28,650 --> 02:39:29,170
Okay.

3322
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:31,730
At least he has no life drain.

3323
02:39:31,890 --> 02:39:33,730
That one was the actual worst though.

3324
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:35,470
Oh, fuck!

3325
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:35,990
Okay.

3326
02:39:37,650 --> 02:39:38,430
You know what?

3327
02:39:38,490 --> 02:39:38,930
Fuck this.

3328
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:39,850
It's time.

3329
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:41,530
That's right.

3330
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:43,690
Even mushrooms get the treatment.

3331
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:48,010
Bad mushroom!

3332
02:39:49,870 --> 02:39:50,910
Bad mushroom!

3333
02:39:51,330 --> 02:39:51,850
Bad!

3334
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:54,450
Get out!

3335
02:39:55,410 --> 02:39:56,190
That's right!

3336
02:39:56,190 --> 02:39:57,970
Learn your place, mushroom!

3337
02:40:03,070 --> 02:40:04,670
So dumb.

3338
02:40:06,310 --> 02:40:07,730
Oh my god.

3339
02:40:07,790 --> 02:40:09,430
Now we're gonna add more...

3340
02:40:09,430 --> 02:40:09,630
No!

3341
02:40:09,850 --> 02:40:10,990
He's dead!

3342
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,150
Ow.

3343
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:15,050
No!

3344
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:18,690
That's not supposed to happen!

3345
02:40:19,690 --> 02:40:21,670
I paid my hours!

3346
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:25,250
Okay.

3347
02:40:25,330 --> 02:40:25,550
Nice.

3348
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:26,510
One HP.

3349
02:40:26,610 --> 02:40:26,870
Oh, wait!

3350
02:40:26,930 --> 02:40:27,210
I lost...

3351
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:27,870
He lost his hat!

3352
02:40:28,030 --> 02:40:28,650
No hat.

3353
02:40:30,050 --> 02:40:30,670
All right.

3354
02:40:31,090 --> 02:40:31,530
Nice.

3355
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:33,150
Absorb.

3356
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:39,840
Nice.

3357
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,300
All right.

3358
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:45,080
Here we go.

3359
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:47,640
All right.

3360
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:48,400
We're gonna heal here.

3361
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:50,020
There was no point.

3362
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,420
Thanks for the hat, bro.

3363
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:55,160
My hat.

3364
02:40:57,060 --> 02:40:57,840
All right.

3365
02:40:57,980 --> 02:40:58,180
Oh.

3366
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:01,100
We go this way.

3367
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:01,600
Oh.

3368
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:06,420
I should be getting a fucking whiplash after this.

3369
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:07,820
Content warning.

3370
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,080
Thank you for the super chat.

3371
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:09,600
Thank you.

3372
02:41:09,620 --> 02:41:10,160
Thank you.

3373
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:12,160
What the fuck?

3374
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:13,220
Is this Indiana Jones?

3375
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:14,140
What the?

3376
02:41:14,300 --> 02:41:15,280
What the fuck?

3377
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:17,800
Oh my god.

3378
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:19,220
Wait, I should be the horse.

3379
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:20,260
I need...

3380
02:41:20,260 --> 02:41:21,600
It would fit...

3381
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:23,700
Wait.

3382
02:41:24,580 --> 02:41:26,280
Let me get rid of this rock first.

3383
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:26,740
All right.

3384
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:27,300
Now...

3385
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:27,860
Okay, guys.

3386
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:28,320
Give me a sec.

3387
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:29,440
All right.

3388
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:31,580
Okay, it's Indiana Jones time.

3389
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:46,400
I didn't realize it comes back.

3390
02:41:52,180 --> 02:41:54,260
Oh my god.

3391
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:57,240
Holy shit, it rolls back.

3392
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:01,040
It rolls back.

3393
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:03,040
What the fuck?

3394
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:04,560
It's so bullshit.

3395
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:08,760
Indiana Jones bad ending.

3396
02:42:09,240 --> 02:42:13,120
How was I supposed to know it rolls back?

3397
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:19,840
I didn't realize.

3398
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:23,400
Oh my god.

3399
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:25,300
I thought it would be a new rock.

3400
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:26,960
Okay, take two.

3401
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:29,180
Okay, take two guys.

3402
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:32,100
Bum-ba-da-dum.

3403
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:33,440
Bum-ba-dum.

3404
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:35,380
Bad.

3405
02:42:35,380 --> 02:42:35,860
Bad.

3406
02:42:36,400 --> 02:42:37,920
Bum-ba-da-dum.

3407
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:38,860
Bum-ba-bum.

3408
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:39,640
Bum-bum.

3409
02:42:40,180 --> 02:42:41,060
Bum-ba-da-dum.

3410
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:44,200
Bum-ba-da-dum.

3411
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:46,220
Bum-ba-dum.

3412
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:46,820
Okay,

3413
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:51,240
now we're okay now.

3414
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:51,940
Guys.

3415
02:42:52,320 --> 02:42:53,200
Guys, we're fine.

3416
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:54,640
Get whipped.

3417
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:56,820
Okay, we just gotta make sure.

3418
02:42:57,280 --> 02:42:57,980
That's fine.

3419
02:42:58,220 --> 02:43:01,060
We're just making sure everything will be fine.

3420
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,480
That's fucking right.

3421
02:43:03,560 --> 02:43:04,160
Get whipped.

3422
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,400
Alright.

3423
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:06,820
Bum-ba-ba-dum.

3424
02:43:07,020 --> 02:43:07,780
Bum-ba-bum.

3425
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:11,140
Oh shit, that was so close.

3426
02:43:11,420 --> 02:43:14,460
That was actually way too close.

3427
02:43:16,420 --> 02:43:17,120
Okay.

3428
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:18,020
It's okay.

3429
02:43:18,300 --> 02:43:19,040
We're okay.

3430
02:43:19,740 --> 02:43:21,160
Everything is safe.

3431
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:22,800
Alright, Indiana Jones over.

3432
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:25,820
That was so close.

3433
02:43:25,820 --> 02:43:27,100
Holy shit.

3434
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:31,120
Alright, nice.

3435
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:33,400
Okay, Indiana Jones is over.

3436
02:43:34,730 --> 02:43:36,720
I can't believe it.

3437
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:37,860
Rolled back.

3438
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:39,920
That's...

3439
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:44,620
I thought it was over.

3440
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:48,380
I thought it was over.

3441
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:49,600
I didn't realize it kept going.

3442
02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:50,700
I didn't...

3443
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:52,760
That's insane.

3444
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,200
That's insane.

3445
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:55,420
That's insane.

3446
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:57,960
Holy shit.

3447
02:43:58,720 --> 02:44:01,200
John, I saw the rock there.

3448
02:44:01,780 --> 02:44:02,600
That's like...

3449
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:05,620
Clearly, it's not gonna go all the way back there.

3450
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:06,840
The rock is there chilling.

3451
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:09,520
John, thank you for the five.

3452
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:10,860
Thank you.

3453
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:11,380
Thank you.

3454
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:12,720
It's time to meditate.

3455
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:13,860
Guys.

3456
02:44:15,220 --> 02:44:16,440
Oh my god.

3457
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:19,580
I can't believe Indiana Jones is dead.

3458
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:21,860
What the fuck?

3459
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:22,860
Wait, that's him.

3460
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:27,180
Wait, that's the Bull King.

3461
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:31,080
Wait, they can't just show that and then like cut somewhere else.

3462
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:32,900
This is the first time I saw him.

3463
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,280
Like, what?

3464
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:39,240
That's him.

3465
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:42,200
That's literally the first time I saw the Bull King.

3466
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:43,120
And then they just...

3467
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:44,800
They just showed him out of nowhere.

3468
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:47,280
Wait, that was where he was?

3469
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:48,760
All along?

3470
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:50,020
Oh my god.

3471
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:51,440
He was in front of me all along.

3472
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:52,340
What the fuck?

3473
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:53,760
Holy shit.

3474
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,080
He was...

3475
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:58,780
He was in front of me the entire time.

3476
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:05,440
Oh my god.

3477
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:07,000
How did I not see him?

3478
02:45:07,060 --> 02:45:08,380
He's so fucking big.

3479
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:11,140
God, he's like...

3480
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:12,380
Look at...

3481
02:45:12,380 --> 02:45:13,740
You can see his bones.

3482
02:45:13,860 --> 02:45:14,820
Holy shit.

3483
02:45:14,900 --> 02:45:17,680
He is fucking malnourished as fuck.

3484
02:45:17,780 --> 02:45:19,040
Somebody feed this bull.

3485
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:22,680
Like, how do you even feed something that big?

3486
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:26,100
Is he even in prison?

3487
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:29,060
Like, it feels like he could just get up and walk away.

3488
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:30,040
Like...

3489
02:45:32,140 --> 02:45:33,400
Like, it really...

3490
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:37,020
It feels like he could literally just get up and walk away.

3491
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:45,200
Like, he's not chained up.

3492
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:46,260
He raised his hand.

3493
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:50,960
He's hurt?

3494
02:45:51,140 --> 02:45:53,120
Just... I don't know.

3495
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:55,200
Just unhurt yourself.

3496
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:57,060
Unhurt yourself now.

3497
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,720
I'll be right back.

3498
02:45:58,760 --> 02:45:59,780
I need to use the bathroom.

3499
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:12,270
Alright, back to Indiana Jones again.

3500
02:47:12,590 --> 02:47:15,390
Indiana Jones part 3.

3501
02:47:18,010 --> 02:47:18,290
This is fine.

3502
02:47:18,330 --> 02:47:20,310
This is the third Indiana Jones movie.

3503
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:21,910
It didn't get bad yet.

3504
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:22,790
We still have to...

3505
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:25,810
The fourth one is when we start to worry.

3506
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:30,800
It's okay.

3507
02:47:34,020 --> 02:47:36,040
Oh my god, I'm so scared of going.

3508
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:39,500
Alright.

3509
02:47:40,380 --> 02:47:41,260
This is fine.

3510
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:42,700
This is fine.

3511
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:44,260
This is so fine.

3512
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:45,300
Okay, it's fine.

3513
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:46,860
These guys aren't that bad.

3514
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:49,400
God, what a fucking stalker.

3515
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:55,400
Alright, we're looking for the holy grail right now, guys.

3516
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:01,780
It's fine.

3517
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:03,480
It doesn't get bad yet.

3518
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:06,820
It's only when we're at the fourth movie that we have to start worrying.

3519
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:09,560
It's only when Shadow Boat starts coming over.

3520
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:10,720
We have to worry.

3521
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:12,320
Okay.

3522
02:48:14,680 --> 02:48:15,300
We're okay.

3523
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:16,900
Stop drop and roll.

3524
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:17,900
Stop drop and roll.

3525
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:20,740
Okay, I can head to this one, right?

3526
02:48:21,160 --> 02:48:22,540
No, I cannot make it there.

3527
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:23,840
I cannot make it there.

3528
02:48:23,860 --> 02:48:25,200
He knows I can't make it there.

3529
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:27,520
Okay, they're fine.

3530
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:27,960
We're fine.

3531
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:30,160
We're so safe.

3532
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:30,980
We're so safe.

3533
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:32,300
We're so safe in this corner.

3534
02:48:32,620 --> 02:48:34,140
We're so safe in this corner.

3535
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,180
Okay.

3536
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:39,800
We shot above with five.

3537
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:40,940
Good to not have two.

3538
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:42,240
One more chance after this.

3539
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:42,520
Two.

3540
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:46,880
I have one more chance after this.

3541
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:48,800
Is this an indent?

3542
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:49,720
Okay, this is.

3543
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:50,100
Okay.

3544
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:54,580
I need to figure out where to go after here.

3545
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:58,240
I thought I was safe before, but I was right.

3546
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:01,120
It has to be here.

3547
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:02,360
It has to be here.

3548
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:04,580
It has to be this giant hole.

3549
02:49:04,660 --> 02:49:05,760
There's no way.

3550
02:49:06,140 --> 02:49:07,080
Okay, thank God.

3551
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:08,300
I was gonna be like that.

3552
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:09,740
That would be so fucking cruel.

3553
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:12,220
If he suddenly just turns from there.

3554
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:13,140
For the first time.

3555
02:49:13,460 --> 02:49:21,340
Could you imagine if the fucking rock just decides to turn right for the first time in the game?

3556
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:22,040
Like...

3557
02:49:23,980 --> 02:49:26,900
That would be like so fucking cruel.

3558
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:31,800
Oh God, there you go.

3559
02:49:33,140 --> 02:49:34,280
Okay, nice.

3560
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:34,680
Alright.

3561
02:49:36,980 --> 02:49:38,820
Make a turn.

3562
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:40,640
Oh, nice.

3563
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:41,180
Okay.

3564
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:43,520
I'll go from here.

3565
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,660
Where is the indent?

3566
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:46,320
Okay, nice.

3567
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:50,280
Oh, you're at the indent.

3568
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:51,320
That's right.

3569
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:52,980
You're here, so that means it's safe.

3570
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:03,780
Oh, I was lied to.

3571
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:05,020
I thought that was a hole.

3572
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:06,100
It wasn't a hole.

3573
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:08,400
It wasn't a hole, guys.

3574
02:50:08,740 --> 02:50:10,040
I felt lied to.

3575
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:12,540
Oh, thank God!

3576
02:50:15,900 --> 02:50:16,380
Okay.

3577
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:18,200
I'm a little worried.

3578
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:22,120
Okay.

3579
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:24,920
I have to go when he goes.

3580
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:26,940
I go when he goes.

3581
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:28,260
It's the way of the law.

3582
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:29,500
Oh, God.

3583
02:50:29,580 --> 02:50:30,700
Oh, God.

3584
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:31,120
No!

3585
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:32,680
Don't do this to me, giant bite!

3586
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:34,940
Okay, there you go.

3587
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:36,220
Oh, thank God.

3588
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:36,460
Okay.

3589
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:37,880
Okay.

3590
02:50:37,880 --> 02:50:38,980
Okay, we're fine.

3591
02:50:43,460 --> 02:50:44,760
Where's the hole in this?

3592
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:49,020
Okay.

3593
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:49,760
We go.

3594
02:50:49,780 --> 02:50:50,180
We go.

3595
02:50:50,180 --> 02:50:50,620
We go.

3596
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:50,980
We go.

3597
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:51,660
Where's the hole?

3598
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:52,200
No.

3599
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:52,480
Okay.

3600
02:50:52,540 --> 02:50:53,100
That's the hole.

3601
02:50:53,320 --> 02:50:54,100
That's the hole.

3602
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:55,860
Oh, thank God.

3603
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:56,960
He gets run over too.

3604
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:02,400
Run.

3605
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:02,840
Run.

3606
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:03,200
Run.

3607
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,040
Run.

3608
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:04,980
Run.

3609
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:07,580
Run like your life depends on it.

3610
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:07,780
Okay.

3611
02:51:07,880 --> 02:51:09,000
This has to be an indent.

3612
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:10,240
I swear to God.

3613
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:12,500
It's like the gut.

3614
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:17,040
Kill that ball first.

3615
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:18,280
There's no way.

3616
02:51:18,380 --> 02:51:19,820
Do not fuck with me.

3617
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:26,440
Wait, you have the fan.

3618
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:28,240
Oh, it's that fan.

3619
02:51:28,960 --> 02:51:30,240
That's a famous fan.

3620
02:51:30,680 --> 02:51:31,080
Okay.

3621
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:33,160
Okay.

3622
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:35,040
Okay.

3623
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:37,020
Okay.

3624
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:37,700
Okay.

3625
02:51:39,080 --> 02:51:39,740
Okay.

3626
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:46,880
Yeah, you just found it on the ground.

3627
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:51,660
Could be bootleg.

3628
02:51:58,540 --> 02:51:59,480
He's just hungry.

3629
02:52:06,140 --> 02:52:07,020
Wait, what?

3630
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:09,440
You could just do that?

3631
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:14,620
Why didn't you do that earlier?

3632
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:17,760
Why did you make me run all the way there?

3633
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:23,940
Oh shit, use the wind.

3634
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:29,480
Get the fire away.

3635
02:52:31,900 --> 02:52:34,280
He just didn't want to.

3636
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:35,260
He just didn't want to.

3637
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:38,680
To be fair, the boss is sort of winning.

3638
02:52:43,250 --> 02:52:44,230
Is he dead?

3639
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:46,930
Did they just kill him?

3640
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:50,170
Oh, don't worry.

3641
02:52:50,290 --> 02:52:50,970
Thank god.

3642
02:52:51,090 --> 02:52:52,270
Okay, I don't have to worry.

3643
02:52:52,550 --> 02:52:53,190
That's fine.

3644
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,350
I was gonna say, now I don't have to choose.

3645
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:04,650
I was like, okay, now that he's dead, I don't have to choose anymore.

3646
02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:08,790
Bye.

3647
02:53:09,250 --> 02:53:09,550
Bye, bro.

3648
02:53:14,510 --> 02:53:15,690
Alright, nice.

3649
02:53:15,810 --> 02:53:17,830
Go back to check the ball?

3650
02:53:18,310 --> 02:53:18,930
What?

3651
02:53:20,490 --> 02:53:22,830
Am I gonna get anything out of it?

3652
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:24,790
Go back?

3653
02:53:25,090 --> 02:53:25,310
Alright.

3654
02:53:28,070 --> 02:53:30,850
Bro, gave you a long time.

3655
02:53:34,600 --> 02:53:36,960
Below the area where there is fire.

3656
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:40,220
You're not narrowing it down for me, guys.

3657
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:40,700
You're not narrowing it down for me, guys.

3658
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:42,440
There was a lot of...

3659
02:53:42,440 --> 02:53:45,420
There was a lot of places with fire.

3660
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:48,200
Oh, there's a shrine ahead?

3661
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:49,640
Okay, we'll get the shrine first.

3662
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:50,600
Like...

3663
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:53,900
You're not...

3664
02:53:54,980 --> 02:53:55,860
There was...

3665
02:53:55,860 --> 02:53:57,800
There was a lot of fire everywhere.

3666
02:53:57,880 --> 02:54:00,000
This area is mostly fire.

3667
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:01,340
Like...

3668
02:54:03,060 --> 02:54:05,400
So it doesn't narrow it down for me.

3669
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,380
Oh, there he is.

3670
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:11,060
I like how that rock is conveniently placed on...

3671
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:15,320
Okay.

3672
02:54:15,600 --> 02:54:16,440
Okay.

3673
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:18,180
It's so convenient.

3674
02:54:18,740 --> 02:54:22,600
It's actually so conveniently placed too.

3675
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:29,700
Oh my god.

3676
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:31,280
That's fucking brilliant.

3677
02:54:34,220 --> 02:54:36,720
I like how he's just...

3678
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:38,180
Oh my god, he's like fully...

3679
02:54:38,380 --> 02:54:40,260
fucking manspreading too.

3680
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:42,800
He...

3681
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:43,520
He...

3682
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:46,320
He can see the fucking full spread.

3683
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:52,260
The rock is...

3684
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:53,540
He don't care.

3685
02:54:53,620 --> 02:54:55,500
He's fucking dying, Toki.

3686
02:54:55,700 --> 02:54:57,320
You think he cares?

3687
02:54:57,460 --> 02:54:58,560
It's like he's at a sauna.

3688
02:54:58,780 --> 02:55:00,540
You see his legs are in the lava?

3689
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:03,220
And everything...

3690
02:55:03,220 --> 02:55:05,660
You see like his legs are in the lava too.

3691
02:55:09,230 --> 02:55:09,870
Alright.

3692
02:55:11,210 --> 02:55:11,510
This way.

3693
02:55:15,680 --> 02:55:16,120
Alright.

3694
02:55:20,130 --> 02:55:20,930
Turn around.

3695
02:55:21,430 --> 02:55:22,470
Kyle, thank you for the super chat.

3696
02:55:22,590 --> 02:55:23,350
Thank you, thank you.

3697
02:55:23,370 --> 02:55:24,190
Okay, where do we go?

3698
02:55:24,510 --> 02:55:25,350
Where is it?

3699
02:55:28,150 --> 02:55:29,030
Guys, where is it?

3700
02:55:29,030 --> 02:55:31,290
Travel back to the Emerald Hall?

3701
02:55:33,850 --> 02:55:34,290
Okay.

3702
02:55:39,510 --> 02:55:43,570
He didn't plan on having guests, so he's chilling.

3703
02:55:50,940 --> 02:55:51,380
Oh.

3704
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:54,640
Where do we go?

3705
02:55:54,780 --> 02:55:55,680
Ahead of the path?

3706
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:57,720
Is it here?

3707
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:07,480
Alright.

3708
02:56:08,300 --> 02:56:09,400
We go up.

3709
02:56:10,220 --> 02:56:11,260
Up we go.

3710
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:14,040
Up we go.

3711
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:15,160
Up we go.

3712
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:17,300
Where we got?

3713
02:56:17,640 --> 02:56:18,760
This is where we...

3714
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:20,080
This is where it happened.

3715
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:23,060
Is there another place where it happened?

3716
02:56:26,260 --> 02:56:27,360
I'm just like...

3717
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:28,660
Is there another one?

3718
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:30,200
Hey, hey, hey.

3719
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:32,840
Thank you for the super chat.

3720
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:33,940
Thank you, thank you.

3721
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:39,060
Oh, the shrine near the mushroom...

3722
02:56:39,720 --> 02:56:40,800
Oh wait, there he is.

3723
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:41,520
There's the ball.

3724
02:56:42,820 --> 02:56:44,880
I like how everybody's just looking at the ball.

3725
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:46,620
They're like, where did that ball come from?

3726
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:50,600
Where did that ball come from?

3727
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:51,280
What the fuck?

3728
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:53,300
I wasn't here last time.

3729
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:56,480
Alright.

3730
02:56:56,940 --> 02:56:58,540
Oh my god, he kicked me.

3731
02:56:58,660 --> 02:56:59,780
Oh my god, that's illegal.

3732
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:03,780
Oh, there's the ball.

3733
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:04,920
Can I absorb this?

3734
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:05,500
Oh, I can!

3735
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:08,360
Nice, it's my ball now.

3736
02:57:12,460 --> 02:57:13,020
Yay!

3737
02:57:14,220 --> 02:57:16,760
Top takes bottom, bottom takes top.

3738
02:57:17,820 --> 02:57:19,420
Alright, now where do we go?

3739
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:25,120
Yeah, like I was hearing this breathing.

3740
02:57:25,240 --> 02:57:27,380
I was like, who the fuck is breathing right now?

3741
02:57:32,380 --> 02:57:33,940
And I guess that was him.

3742
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:37,340
Alright.

3743
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:39,360
So where is the area?

3744
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:44,340
No, I already opened that chest.

3745
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:48,480
Is it this area?

3746
02:57:50,220 --> 02:57:51,780
Which one is the secret area?

3747
02:57:51,880 --> 02:57:53,240
Hey there, I killed him.

3748
02:57:56,340 --> 02:57:57,700
Oh, okay, that's not it.

3749
02:57:58,260 --> 02:58:00,280
Oh, where the ball was chasing me.

3750
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:00,760
Okay.

3751
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:02,020
I mean, we're almost there.

3752
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:02,900
We might as well head over.

3753
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:06,600
I think we're almost there, right?

3754
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:08,460
It's literally in front of us.

3755
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:11,460
It's like...

3756
02:58:12,700 --> 02:58:13,360
It's fine.

3757
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:14,600
We'll just walk up.

3758
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:17,600
Like, it's literally right there.

3759
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:18,280
Anyway.

3760
02:58:19,660 --> 02:58:21,320
Like, we don't care about these guys.

3761
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:23,100
Okay, you know what?

3762
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:23,960
No, actually, there's...

3763
02:58:23,980 --> 02:58:24,620
This is too much.

3764
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:30,700
As I kept walking, I was like, wait a minute.

3765
02:58:30,760 --> 02:58:31,720
No, this is too far.

3766
02:58:36,360 --> 02:58:37,160
Never mind.

3767
02:58:37,240 --> 02:58:38,180
I changed my mind.

3768
02:58:38,580 --> 02:58:40,260
I don't want to walk that much.

3769
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:43,400
Okay.

3770
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:44,960
So it should be...

3771
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:48,420
Here.

3772
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:49,900
That should be where it is.

3773
02:58:51,060 --> 02:58:51,460
Right?

3774
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:52,280
I assume so.

3775
02:59:00,120 --> 02:59:00,760
Alright.

3776
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:03,100
Where's the secret area?

3777
02:59:07,700 --> 02:59:08,800
Where is it?

3778
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:09,480
Guys.

3779
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:14,600
There would be a right turn.

3780
02:59:15,980 --> 02:59:16,960
Like here?

3781
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:23,400
Oh, it's in the middle?

3782
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:24,000
Okay.

3783
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:25,480
We'll just keep walking.

3784
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:26,920
Okay.

3785
02:59:27,640 --> 02:59:30,020
We'll just keep walking until it hits.

3786
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:32,440
Until the pathway hits.

3787
02:59:33,740 --> 02:59:34,580
No, okay.

3788
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:38,120
I assume it's like a tiny pathway too.

3789
02:59:41,910 --> 02:59:43,050
Which one is it?

3790
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:44,990
Oh, I will see it?

3791
02:59:45,090 --> 02:59:45,350
Okay.

3792
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:47,870
I was just thinking like, will I be able to see the pathway?

3793
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:52,740
Okay, I'm looking.

3794
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,060
There's no holes here.

3795
02:59:54,760 --> 02:59:55,940
Oh, it's a huge path.

3796
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:57,260
Okay, now I don't have to care anymore.

3797
02:59:59,240 --> 03:00:00,560
Now I'll just walk.

3798
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:01,840
I'll just keep walking.

3799
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:05,180
Where the bull died?

3800
03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:06,280
I killed a bull?

3801
03:00:07,940 --> 03:00:09,060
Oh, shit!

3802
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:12,560
Oh my god.

3803
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:13,420
You're still alive?

3804
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:15,840
That's a bull?

3805
03:00:17,840 --> 03:00:20,460
That looks like a fucking John Ratt.

3806
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:26,260
Oh, what the fuck he sat on me?

3807
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:28,300
I knocked the horse right down.

3808
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:29,900
Bro, you're not...

3809
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:33,980
This is a 5 o'clock appointment.

3810
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:35,160
This is a 5 o'clock appointment.

3811
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:36,160
I'm with Mr. Horsey.

3812
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:41,380
Holy fuck.

3813
03:00:44,380 --> 03:00:45,720
Okay, get this guy out of here.

3814
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:48,720
Yeah, he Gibraltared me.

3815
03:00:49,580 --> 03:00:50,260
Nice, alright.

3816
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:51,400
Oh wait, I got...

3817
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:52,340
Oh shit, nice!

3818
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:55,600
I got like an extra gear.

3819
03:00:57,380 --> 03:00:58,060
For that.

3820
03:00:58,360 --> 03:01:00,040
I mean, at least I got extra stuff.

3821
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:05,400
Nice.

3822
03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:07,680
What does it do?

3823
03:01:07,700 --> 03:01:08,880
I don't know.

3824
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:09,960
Seems like he'll be weak.

3825
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:12,720
Let's see.

3826
03:01:13,020 --> 03:01:14,080
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3827
03:01:16,440 --> 03:01:17,680
It's like 30.

3828
03:01:17,940 --> 03:01:18,460
It's not...

3829
03:01:18,460 --> 03:01:20,600
It's literally just cosmetic.

3830
03:01:20,740 --> 03:01:21,900
What the fuck?

3831
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:28,440
Alright.

3832
03:01:34,130 --> 03:01:35,210
Wait, wrong way?

3833
03:01:35,750 --> 03:01:37,130
But it's cool!

3834
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:43,500
There it is.

3835
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:44,080
I found it.

3836
03:01:45,400 --> 03:01:47,460
It wasn't the wrong way, you fuckers.

3837
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:48,020
It's right here.

3838
03:01:56,930 --> 03:01:58,370
Where the fuck am I?

3839
03:01:59,310 --> 03:02:00,270
I'm like...

3840
03:02:01,270 --> 03:02:02,450
I'm like looking around.

3841
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:03,630
I'm like, where am I?

3842
03:02:06,810 --> 03:02:08,310
Oh, this has to be it.

3843
03:02:08,770 --> 03:02:09,890
This guy...

3844
03:02:09,890 --> 03:02:11,550
Yeah, okay.

3845
03:02:12,250 --> 03:02:13,590
I'm just like...

3846
03:02:14,650 --> 03:02:16,110
What the fuck?

3847
03:02:16,650 --> 03:02:17,170
Oh!

3848
03:02:18,230 --> 03:02:18,990
That's illegal!

3849
03:02:19,330 --> 03:02:19,890
What?

3850
03:02:21,550 --> 03:02:22,530
Hey, look.

3851
03:02:22,630 --> 03:02:25,190
If you're gonna get all your friends involved...

3852
03:02:26,390 --> 03:02:27,510
Holy shit.

3853
03:02:27,970 --> 03:02:28,530
Alright.

3854
03:02:28,650 --> 03:02:29,270
This is it.

3855
03:02:30,170 --> 03:02:31,590
Oh my god.

3856
03:02:31,670 --> 03:02:33,690
Did my spell not even go through?

3857
03:02:35,290 --> 03:02:36,930
My spell didn't even go through.

3858
03:02:37,110 --> 03:02:38,030
My spell...

3859
03:02:38,030 --> 03:02:40,970
This is bullshit.

3860
03:02:41,010 --> 03:02:41,930
This is not cool.

3861
03:02:42,210 --> 03:02:43,650
You know what time it is.

3862
03:02:43,650 --> 03:02:44,210
It's...

3863
03:02:44,210 --> 03:02:47,050
It's my four o'clock appointment time.

3864
03:02:47,250 --> 03:02:48,690
Okay, well...

3865
03:02:52,090 --> 03:02:54,250
Holy shit!

3866
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:56,510
If I could move...

3867
03:02:57,350 --> 03:02:57,890
Okay!

3868
03:02:58,010 --> 03:03:00,530
It's Horsey's four o'clock appointment.

3869
03:03:02,790 --> 03:03:06,170
What the fuck was that?

3870
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:15,520
Oh my god.

3871
03:03:15,740 --> 03:03:17,680
Oh my god.

3872
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:18,620
Holy shit.

3873
03:03:18,840 --> 03:03:20,680
That was actually...

3874
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:23,940
A fucking beatdown right there.

3875
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:25,800
I have an idea.

3876
03:03:25,940 --> 03:03:26,480
Chat.

3877
03:03:26,620 --> 03:03:28,220
I know what to do.

3878
03:03:29,220 --> 03:03:29,820
Travel.

3879
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:32,740
Okay, I'll just have to run.

3880
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:33,480
Right here.

3881
03:03:33,560 --> 03:03:34,140
I got an idea.

3882
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:39,380
I got an idea, guys.

3883
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:41,540
After that...

3884
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:43,920
I'm fucking removing shit.

3885
03:03:45,440 --> 03:03:46,040
Okay.

3886
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:48,580
We're gonna get rid of...

3887
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:50,340
We're gonna get rid of cloud step.

3888
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:54,220
And go all in on the monkey army.

3889
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:59,340
Okay, go all in.

3890
03:03:59,440 --> 03:04:00,700
And also...

3891
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:04,580
Okay, there we go.

3892
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:06,020
And then...

3893
03:04:06,020 --> 03:04:07,300
There we go.

3894
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:10,300
Increase the damage.

3895
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:10,860
Okay.

3896
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:12,900
Actually, no.

3897
03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:21,300
There we go.

3898
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:23,880
There's way too many.

3899
03:04:23,980 --> 03:04:24,480
There's way too many things there.

3900
03:04:24,820 --> 03:04:30,080
There's way too many rocks there.

3901
03:04:32,280 --> 03:04:34,380
The last one makes it cost more.

3902
03:04:34,660 --> 03:04:35,280
Wait, does it?

3903
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:36,740
I didn't read.

3904
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:37,580
You guys know that.

3905
03:04:38,060 --> 03:04:41,540
I would be like, wow, there's a lot.

3906
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:43,220
So clearly it's good, right?

3907
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:46,920
Oh, extensa mana.

3908
03:04:47,380 --> 03:04:47,880
Oh, okay.

3909
03:04:48,020 --> 03:04:49,220
I guess I'll get rid of that.

3910
03:04:49,220 --> 03:04:50,060
That's fine.

3911
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:53,220
And I'll just put more onto...

3912
03:04:59,080 --> 03:05:00,000
I'll just...

3913
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,680
I'll put one...

3914
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:03,820
One of the cloud steps.

3915
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:05,660
I'll do...

3916
03:05:05,660 --> 03:05:08,000
I'll do one of the cloud steps.

3917
03:05:09,520 --> 03:05:10,000
Alright.

3918
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:16,620
Alright, here we go.

3919
03:05:20,170 --> 03:05:20,950
Here we go.

3920
03:05:21,070 --> 03:05:21,470
Let's go.

3921
03:05:22,270 --> 03:05:24,570
No, I'm not gonna turn the wall to walk...

3922
03:05:24,570 --> 03:05:25,590
I need to get there.

3923
03:05:25,590 --> 03:05:27,990
I still need to fucking make it over there.

3924
03:05:28,470 --> 03:05:29,070
Wait,

3925
03:05:32,610 --> 03:05:33,450
the last node?

3926
03:05:34,530 --> 03:05:35,090
Oh!

3927
03:05:37,210 --> 03:05:39,550
The last node is what makes it OP?

3928
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:40,270
Okay.

3929
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:41,130
Back.

3930
03:05:41,310 --> 03:05:42,310
We're going back.

3931
03:05:43,550 --> 03:05:45,750
I guess we're going back.

3932
03:05:49,880 --> 03:05:50,480
Alright.

3933
03:05:58,810 --> 03:05:59,410
Alright.

3934
03:06:00,770 --> 03:06:01,670
Let's see.

3935
03:06:06,510 --> 03:06:06,870
Alright.

3936
03:06:07,990 --> 03:06:08,490
Oh, wait.

3937
03:06:08,510 --> 03:06:09,410
No, I already awakened it.

3938
03:06:09,470 --> 03:06:10,290
What the fuck, guys?

3939
03:06:12,950 --> 03:06:13,770
I guess I'll...

3940
03:06:13,770 --> 03:06:14,810
I guess I'll use this.

3941
03:06:16,850 --> 03:06:17,370
Wait, no.

3942
03:06:17,430 --> 03:06:18,190
It's this, right?

3943
03:06:18,290 --> 03:06:18,550
Yeah.

3944
03:06:20,150 --> 03:06:21,610
It's the second last node.

3945
03:06:23,130 --> 03:06:23,490
Alright.

3946
03:06:23,550 --> 03:06:24,630
The second last node.

3947
03:06:24,710 --> 03:06:25,430
Okay, we go back.

3948
03:06:27,110 --> 03:06:28,330
There's a shrine there?

3949
03:06:28,530 --> 03:06:30,430
Is it closer if I go...

3950
03:06:30,430 --> 03:06:32,230
Is it closer if I go backwards?

3951
03:06:32,610 --> 03:06:34,750
It might be closer if I go backwards, right?

3952
03:06:34,870 --> 03:06:35,210
It might be closer if I go backwards, right?

3953
03:06:42,980 --> 03:06:43,500
Yeah?

3954
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:45,140
Alright, I'll do it from this angle.

3955
03:06:49,020 --> 03:06:49,540
Okay.

3956
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:51,820
I'll do it from here.

3957
03:06:56,570 --> 03:06:58,730
Okay, this is where the big guy is.

3958
03:06:58,910 --> 03:06:59,170
Okay.

3959
03:06:59,270 --> 03:07:01,430
Where the conveniently placed rock is.

3960
03:07:01,750 --> 03:07:03,070
And I'll just go from here.

3961
03:07:06,550 --> 03:07:07,870
Guys, it was not closer.

3962
03:07:11,950 --> 03:07:14,170
Guys, this is not closer.

3963
03:07:14,670 --> 03:07:15,810
I'm fucking...

3964
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:18,210
I'm like looking back and I'm like...

3965
03:07:18,210 --> 03:07:19,910
Guys, I don't think this was closer.

3966
03:07:21,270 --> 03:07:22,390
Just jump.

3967
03:07:29,930 --> 03:07:31,530
At least there's no enemies.

3968
03:07:31,730 --> 03:07:32,490
Yeah, you're right.

3969
03:07:35,630 --> 03:07:37,150
No more enemies here.

3970
03:07:39,850 --> 03:07:41,450
Yeah, it's like in the middle.

3971
03:07:42,490 --> 03:07:43,810
Okay, we just gotta...

3972
03:07:44,830 --> 03:07:45,790
It looks...

3973
03:07:45,810 --> 03:07:46,950
It looks closer though.

3974
03:07:49,170 --> 03:07:49,590
Alright,

3975
03:08:01,220 --> 03:08:01,580
here we go.

3976
03:08:05,900 --> 03:08:06,320
Here?

3977
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:06,980
Yeah, it was here.

3978
03:08:13,620 --> 03:08:14,040
Alright.

3979
03:08:18,750 --> 03:08:20,150
I'll get rid of this guy first.

3980
03:08:23,490 --> 03:08:25,090
I think I did get rid of her.

3981
03:08:25,850 --> 03:08:27,530
Is there any other secret boss here?

3982
03:08:30,950 --> 03:08:31,830
Oh, there is!

3983
03:08:32,610 --> 03:08:32,850
I knew it.

3984
03:08:33,370 --> 03:08:34,390
Goddamn, I knew it.

3985
03:08:35,890 --> 03:08:37,130
I knew you were...

3986
03:08:37,130 --> 03:08:37,390
No!

3987
03:08:37,510 --> 03:08:38,210
I'm on fire!

3988
03:08:41,010 --> 03:08:42,250
I'm so stupid!

3989
03:08:43,410 --> 03:08:43,930
Alright.

3990
03:08:44,790 --> 03:08:45,510
It's fine.

3991
03:08:46,650 --> 03:08:48,670
I like literally stood in front of it.

3992
03:08:53,830 --> 03:08:56,230
Can I like clear the guys here?

3993
03:08:59,900 --> 03:09:01,000
Is there anybody here?

3994
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:04,240
I guess he like summons more.

3995
03:09:07,800 --> 03:09:08,320
Right?

3996
03:09:08,460 --> 03:09:09,160
Is there more?

3997
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:10,080
Oh, there it is.

3998
03:09:11,720 --> 03:09:13,320
No, I have to go through him.

3999
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:15,840
There's no way I activate him here, right?

4000
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:20,540
Nice.

4001
03:09:21,720 --> 03:09:22,240
Nice.

4002
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:24,520
Okay, that's good.

4003
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:27,040
That's good.

4004
03:09:28,220 --> 03:09:29,580
I assume he's...

4005
03:09:29,580 --> 03:09:31,060
Yeah, he's...

4006
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:32,020
What?

4007
03:09:32,280 --> 03:09:33,420
You tell... What?

4008
03:09:33,600 --> 03:09:35,400
It didn't... Oh my god.

4009
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:37,280
It didn't even register.

4010
03:09:40,380 --> 03:09:41,160
That's illegal.

4011
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:43,560
That's actually illegal.

4012
03:09:46,780 --> 03:09:48,960
Oh, and then there's one over here?

4013
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:51,740
Why is there so many of you guys?

4014
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:54,740
Like, is this like a fucking convention?

4015
03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:56,660
Of like rock men?

4016
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:00,460
Am I the bad guy?

4017
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:04,620
It's just...

4018
03:10:04,620 --> 03:10:06,100
It's literally a meet and greet.

4019
03:10:06,240 --> 03:10:08,480
And I'm just coming in here and be like, Hey guys.

4020
03:10:10,400 --> 03:10:11,500
It's their home.

4021
03:10:11,800 --> 03:10:14,360
I'm literally a home invader right now.

4022
03:10:18,810 --> 03:10:19,250
Okay.

4023
03:10:19,250 --> 03:10:20,170
Is there any more?

4024
03:10:21,370 --> 03:10:22,090
There is.

4025
03:10:22,190 --> 03:10:22,990
The last guy here.

4026
03:10:26,410 --> 03:10:27,210
Oh shit.

4027
03:10:28,690 --> 03:10:29,730
These ones are annoying.

4028
03:10:29,910 --> 03:10:30,150
Okay.

4029
03:10:30,610 --> 03:10:31,230
That's fine.

4030
03:10:31,330 --> 03:10:32,070
Alright, here we go.

4031
03:10:33,250 --> 03:10:33,910
Pluck time.

4032
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:34,830
Oh fuck.

4033
03:10:34,950 --> 03:10:35,270
Okay.

4034
03:10:35,770 --> 03:10:37,350
That's not what I wanted to do.

4035
03:10:37,710 --> 03:10:39,290
And I missed.

4036
03:10:39,490 --> 03:10:39,770
Okay.

4037
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:42,510
Alright.

4038
03:10:42,590 --> 03:10:43,230
Here we go.

4039
03:10:43,370 --> 03:10:43,870
It's alright.

4040
03:10:46,170 --> 03:10:46,850
Alright guys.

4041
03:10:46,950 --> 03:10:47,250
Let's go.

4042
03:10:47,690 --> 03:10:48,910
Let's fucking go guys.

4043
03:10:49,050 --> 03:10:49,570
This is it.

4044
03:10:50,770 --> 03:10:51,490
This is it.

4045
03:10:51,610 --> 03:10:51,750
Oh!

4046
03:10:51,950 --> 03:10:53,310
And we have double ammo!

4047
03:10:53,770 --> 03:10:54,970
Let's fucking go!

4048
03:10:57,070 --> 03:10:57,510
Let's...

4049
03:11:01,180 --> 03:11:02,400
Oh shit.

4050
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:03,000
Wait, this is OP.

4051
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:03,980
What the fuck?

4052
03:11:04,060 --> 03:11:06,060
Wait, I should have been doing... Oh my god.

4053
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:06,740
Guys!

4054
03:11:08,220 --> 03:11:09,880
Wait, Pluck is so OP!

4055
03:11:11,620 --> 03:11:12,160
Wait!

4056
03:11:13,830 --> 03:11:15,760
What the fuck have I been doing?

4057
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:19,920
Wait, they're all dead.

4058
03:11:21,060 --> 03:11:22,420
Okay, they're all dead now.

4059
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:23,080
It's alright.

4060
03:11:23,180 --> 03:11:23,840
It's whip time.

4061
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:24,340
Whip.

4062
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:24,880
Whip.

4063
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:25,860
Whip.

4064
03:11:27,380 --> 03:11:28,540
That's fucking right.

4065
03:11:28,980 --> 03:11:29,840
It's now.

4066
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:30,960
It's my appointment.

4067
03:11:31,220 --> 03:11:33,440
Now it's your appointment time.

4068
03:11:34,940 --> 03:11:36,620
That's fucking right.

4069
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:39,420
It's your four o'clock appointment.

4070
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:40,980
Oh no.

4071
03:11:41,020 --> 03:11:43,040
It's eight o'clock appointment.

4072
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:43,720
Damn.

4073
03:11:44,360 --> 03:11:45,800
After work hours.

4074
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,120
Okay.

4075
03:11:54,800 --> 03:11:55,420
Alright.

4076
03:11:55,500 --> 03:11:55,720
Nice.

4077
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:56,120
We're fine.

4078
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:00,380
Yeah.

4079
03:12:00,460 --> 03:12:00,960
Oh shit.

4080
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:01,460
Okay.

4081
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:02,060
I was going to be like...

4082
03:12:02,060 --> 03:12:02,260
Yeah.

4083
03:12:03,500 --> 03:12:04,120
Look.

4084
03:12:04,340 --> 03:12:04,980
You have to be careful.

4085
03:12:04,980 --> 03:12:05,940
He had a hard day at work.

4086
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:09,840
He had a hard day at work, guys.

4087
03:12:12,500 --> 03:12:14,000
He had a hard day at work, guys.

4088
03:12:15,740 --> 03:12:16,280
Nice.

4089
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:18,060
Yay!

4090
03:12:18,300 --> 03:12:19,660
We got another Yaoguai.

4091
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:22,360
A Flint Vanguard.

4092
03:12:23,320 --> 03:12:25,040
One more boss.

4093
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:25,860
One more boss.

4094
03:12:25,960 --> 03:12:26,500
Alright.

4095
03:12:27,380 --> 03:12:29,660
I think I like the horse guy more than the yellow dragon.

4096
03:12:30,780 --> 03:12:32,040
Is there anything down here?

4097
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:33,080
Oh, there is loot.

4098
03:12:34,980 --> 03:12:35,440
Okay.

4099
03:12:36,240 --> 03:12:36,800
No.

4100
03:12:40,850 --> 03:12:44,010
The multiple monkeys is pretty strong though.

4101
03:12:44,030 --> 03:12:44,150
The multiple monkeys is pretty strong though.

4102
03:12:44,150 --> 03:12:44,690
I have to admit.

4103
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:48,110
I like the multiple monkeys.

4104
03:12:49,910 --> 03:12:51,030
I like the multiple monkeys.

4105
03:12:55,240 --> 03:12:55,800
Alright.

4106
03:12:55,900 --> 03:12:56,340
Nice.

4107
03:12:56,340 --> 03:12:56,760
Okay.

4108
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:57,960
Get out of here.

4109
03:12:58,420 --> 03:13:00,620
Oh, there's two secret bosses here?

4110
03:13:00,780 --> 03:13:01,200
Oh, okay.

4111
03:13:02,040 --> 03:13:02,600
Alright.

4112
03:13:02,660 --> 03:13:03,020
That's fine.

4113
03:13:05,680 --> 03:13:05,960
Oh.

4114
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:06,320
Okay.

4115
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:08,960
Where's the other boss?

4116
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:10,760
It has to be a snake, right?

4117
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:13,160
There's so many snake guys here.

4118
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:15,360
There's so many lava snakes.

4119
03:13:15,860 --> 03:13:17,260
I feel like it has to be one.

4120
03:13:19,180 --> 03:13:20,960
Oh, I have to do a quest for the boss?

4121
03:13:21,320 --> 03:13:21,620
Wait.

4122
03:13:21,700 --> 03:13:22,640
What quest do I have to do?

4123
03:13:31,470 --> 03:13:31,910
Wait.

4124
03:13:31,910 --> 03:13:32,190
What?

4125
03:13:34,670 --> 03:13:35,110
Oh!

4126
03:13:35,370 --> 03:13:36,890
I didn't kill all the cards.

4127
03:13:37,050 --> 03:13:37,410
No!

4128
03:13:40,770 --> 03:13:41,850
Oh, I did do the quest.

4129
03:13:41,890 --> 03:13:42,290
Oh, nice.

4130
03:13:42,370 --> 03:13:42,550
Okay.

4131
03:13:42,670 --> 03:13:43,030
Yay!

4132
03:13:46,030 --> 03:13:46,750
Thank God.

4133
03:13:46,810 --> 03:13:47,630
I was gonna be like...

4134
03:13:48,370 --> 03:13:49,250
I don't know.

4135
03:13:49,670 --> 03:13:50,570
I can't count.

4136
03:13:53,370 --> 03:13:55,190
I can't count so I don't know.

4137
03:13:57,170 --> 03:13:58,430
Yeah, I have the horse guy.

4138
03:14:00,290 --> 03:14:00,650
Guys.

4139
03:14:01,410 --> 03:14:02,270
No, I don't.

4140
03:14:02,350 --> 03:14:03,610
Which card am I missing?

4141
03:14:03,610 --> 03:14:04,650
Got...

4142
03:14:06,490 --> 03:14:08,370
He was right!

4143
03:14:13,390 --> 03:14:15,170
He was right!

4144
03:14:20,310 --> 03:14:22,830
Oh, not the same boss.

4145
03:14:23,770 --> 03:14:25,370
Oh, that's from the mobs?

4146
03:14:25,670 --> 03:14:27,110
What the fuck is a flame?

4147
03:14:27,130 --> 03:14:28,310
How do I get the flame ore?

4148
03:14:31,410 --> 03:14:32,770
Oh, I can buy...

4149
03:14:33,610 --> 03:14:35,250
I can go back to the shrine.

4150
03:14:36,250 --> 03:14:39,290
Are you fucking kidding me?

4151
03:14:39,790 --> 03:14:41,390
Are you fucking kidding me?

4152
03:14:41,390 --> 03:14:42,710
Okay, let's...

4153
03:14:43,710 --> 03:14:45,190
Instant transmission.

4154
03:14:46,050 --> 03:14:47,230
Oh, no!

4155
03:14:47,450 --> 03:14:48,290
What the fuck?

4156
03:14:54,410 --> 03:14:55,170
Wait,

4157
03:14:58,950 --> 03:14:59,670
keep going!

4158
03:14:59,770 --> 03:15:00,670
There's a shrine!

4159
03:15:00,790 --> 03:15:01,190
Okay.

4160
03:15:01,810 --> 03:15:04,410
Here we go again, guys.

4161
03:15:07,450 --> 03:15:08,830
Here we go again.

4162
03:15:08,930 --> 03:15:09,310
Here we go again.

4163
03:15:09,390 --> 03:15:10,230
There was...

4164
03:15:12,890 --> 03:15:14,070
Here we go.

4165
03:15:16,190 --> 03:15:17,370
Oh my God.

4166
03:15:17,390 --> 03:15:18,090
I didn't know!

4167
03:15:18,270 --> 03:15:19,390
There was no yellow...

4168
03:15:19,390 --> 03:15:20,970
There was no yellow spray!

4169
03:15:22,570 --> 03:15:24,230
I wanna see if I can buy a flame ore.

4170
03:15:24,430 --> 03:15:25,470
Pay to win, baby.

4171
03:15:25,830 --> 03:15:27,210
Oh, I can craft a weapon, too.

4172
03:15:29,710 --> 03:15:32,150
So, attack 100, defense 40.

4173
03:15:32,510 --> 03:15:33,210
What's mine?

4174
03:15:33,970 --> 03:15:34,450
108.

4175
03:15:35,170 --> 03:15:36,590
Well, I mean...

4176
03:15:38,510 --> 03:15:40,230
In this match, in this match...

4177
03:15:40,230 --> 03:15:40,410
In this match, in this match...

4178
03:15:40,410 --> 03:15:45,750
I mean, there's a defense 40, too.

4179
03:15:46,290 --> 03:15:46,530
I mean, there's a defense 40, too.

4180
03:15:46,530 --> 03:15:47,110
I mean, there's a defense 40, too.

4181
03:15:47,150 --> 03:15:47,490
Yeah.

4182
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:53,580
Hmm...

4183
03:15:53,580 --> 03:15:55,540
Oh, I can't craft it yet?

4184
03:15:55,920 --> 03:15:56,920
Oh, I can't.

4185
03:15:56,920 --> 03:15:57,280
You're right.

4186
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:59,900
There was no point in me even looking at it.

4187
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:01,860
There was no point.

4188
03:16:02,280 --> 03:16:02,340
There was no point.

4189
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:04,000
Uh, alright.

4190
03:16:06,300 --> 03:16:06,780
Uh...

4191
03:16:06,780 --> 03:16:07,700
Wait, what is this?

4192
03:16:07,940 --> 03:16:08,720
A new soak?

4193
03:16:09,980 --> 03:16:11,160
Ugh, not worth.

4194
03:16:12,100 --> 03:16:12,620
Alright.

4195
03:16:14,180 --> 03:16:15,120
Where's the store?

4196
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:16,780
Flame...

4197
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:17,860
Oh, flame ore.

4198
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:18,340
There we go.

4199
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:21,380
Nice, we have it now.

4200
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:24,040
Alright.

4201
03:16:27,400 --> 03:16:28,180
Here we go.

4202
03:16:30,440 --> 03:16:31,740
Alright, now that we...

4203
03:16:31,740 --> 03:16:33,540
Now we keep going back.

4204
03:16:35,380 --> 03:16:35,900
Yay!

4205
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:38,960
We're off to see the wizard.

4206
03:16:39,020 --> 03:16:40,760
The wonderful wizard of Oz.

4207
03:16:40,860 --> 03:16:42,480
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-bum.

4208
03:16:42,620 --> 03:16:44,380
Ba-ba-dum-ba-bum.

4209
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,720
Off to another adventure.

4210
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:47,800
Here we go.

4211
03:16:48,740 --> 03:16:49,580
Let's go.

4212
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:52,220
Let's go.

4213
03:16:52,680 --> 03:16:54,860
Let's go.

4214
03:16:55,440 --> 03:16:56,480
Oh my god.

4215
03:16:56,500 --> 03:16:57,460
I'm tired already.

4216
03:16:57,680 --> 03:17:00,060
My monkey stamina is going down.

4217
03:17:00,580 --> 03:17:01,320
This...

4218
03:17:02,920 --> 03:17:03,660
Alright.

4219
03:17:04,140 --> 03:17:05,920
Guys, we're almost there.

4220
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:08,180
Guys, we're almost there.

4221
03:17:08,180 --> 03:17:12,440
I have to fight the little baby fucking rocks again.

4222
03:17:12,640 --> 03:17:14,520
I'm just going to run past them until I get to the shrine.

4223
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:15,500
Fuck that shit.

4224
03:17:17,660 --> 03:17:19,000
Horse guy wins.

4225
03:17:19,460 --> 03:17:20,560
Yes, he wins.

4226
03:17:20,820 --> 03:17:26,920
The moment I lose stamina from horse guy, he fucking disappears and leaves you like your dad.

4227
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:28,120
He fucking disappears and leaves you like your dad.

4228
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:28,880
He fucking disappears and leaves you like your dad.

4229
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:30,660
I don't take that back, by the way.

4230
03:17:30,860 --> 03:17:31,060
I don't.

4231
03:17:34,160 --> 03:17:34,680
Damn.

4232
03:17:35,020 --> 03:17:35,540
Whoa.

4233
03:17:35,540 --> 03:17:35,860
Whoa.

4234
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:40,240
Alright.

4235
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:41,560
Wow.

4236
03:17:43,940 --> 03:17:44,460
Alright.

4237
03:17:46,940 --> 03:17:47,680
It's fine.

4238
03:17:47,900 --> 03:17:49,060
We just go straight down.

4239
03:17:49,960 --> 03:17:51,220
Just let them scream.

4240
03:17:51,980 --> 03:17:53,920
You're just mad because they're not you.

4241
03:17:54,840 --> 03:17:58,350
You're just mad because they're not you.

4242
03:17:58,650 --> 03:17:59,170
Damn.

4243
03:18:04,970 --> 03:18:10,130
Guys, you know it's true because why else would horse guy has like so many 4PM appointments, guys?

4244
03:18:14,970 --> 03:18:15,490
Alright.

4245
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:19,810
Where's the shrine?

4246
03:18:21,490 --> 03:18:23,170
Where the fuck is the shrine?

4247
03:18:24,470 --> 03:18:25,790
It's down here, right?

4248
03:18:27,630 --> 03:18:29,150
Wait, how do I get downstairs?

4249
03:18:31,490 --> 03:18:32,950
Oh, the right hand side?

4250
03:18:33,390 --> 03:18:34,330
Oh, this side?

4251
03:18:34,450 --> 03:18:34,610
Okay.

4252
03:18:39,730 --> 03:18:41,190
Oh, this way.

4253
03:18:41,370 --> 03:18:41,850
Oh, this way.

4254
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:46,880
What the fuck is it?

4255
03:18:49,880 --> 03:18:50,840
What the fuck is it?

4256
03:18:50,840 --> 03:18:51,480
Where is it?

4257
03:18:52,240 --> 03:18:52,740
Where is it?

4258
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:54,380
I see other rocks.

4259
03:18:55,240 --> 03:18:56,600
Oh, just keep going down?

4260
03:18:56,780 --> 03:18:57,020
Okay.

4261
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:00,360
Alright, let's get hair out of the way.

4262
03:19:01,580 --> 03:19:02,280
That's right.

4263
03:19:02,340 --> 03:19:03,060
That's for falling.

4264
03:19:03,240 --> 03:19:04,540
Oh, let's get the worm.

4265
03:19:05,100 --> 03:19:06,720
The lava worms out too.

4266
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:09,020
Because they're pretty annoying as well.

4267
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:09,580
Because they're pretty annoying as well.

4268
03:19:10,540 --> 03:19:11,920
Alright, let's see.

4269
03:19:12,340 --> 03:19:14,100
Oh hey, random eagle guy.

4270
03:19:14,940 --> 03:19:16,080
Get over here.

4271
03:19:17,980 --> 03:19:18,740
That's right.

4272
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:20,880
I'm having a bad day.

4273
03:19:21,140 --> 03:19:23,320
So I'm gonna beat you up now.

4274
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:25,500
To make myself feel better.

4275
03:19:26,300 --> 03:19:28,760
It's a fucking cycle of abuse.

4276
03:19:30,220 --> 03:19:32,200
Don't worry, I'm getting better though.

4277
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:35,860
I'm getting anger management classes.

4278
03:19:38,460 --> 03:19:39,380
Alright, nice.

4279
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:41,960
I got fine gold material.

4280
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:46,380
I hope you get better.

4281
03:19:51,360 --> 03:19:53,820
Okay, I just wanted him to get out of my way too.

4282
03:19:57,580 --> 03:19:59,120
Oh, there it is!

4283
03:19:59,160 --> 03:19:59,860
There's the shrine!

4284
03:20:00,780 --> 03:20:04,300
Okay, I'm gonna kill that and then go backwards.

4285
03:20:05,100 --> 03:20:07,100
And then do the flame ore thing.

4286
03:20:07,660 --> 03:20:09,320
That's too real!

4287
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:13,480
Okay, rest.

4288
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:19,500
I couldn't get to the bank today!

4289
03:20:24,380 --> 03:20:27,040
So I take it out on you!

4290
03:20:32,020 --> 03:20:32,800
Fuck, okay.

4291
03:20:35,780 --> 03:20:37,940
I just wanna make sure that guy doesn't...

4292
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:39,940
Alright, that's fine.

4293
03:20:40,020 --> 03:20:40,660
He's just one hit.

4294
03:20:40,780 --> 03:20:41,220
Nice.

4295
03:20:41,440 --> 03:20:42,440
Alright, we go back up.

4296
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:45,840
Oh, he's still there.

4297
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:49,360
Alright, we go...

4298
03:20:49,360 --> 03:20:49,820
Wait, what?

4299
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:51,200
Oh, I forgot to stop, drop, and roll!

4300
03:20:52,120 --> 03:20:55,180
Guys, always remember the most important three R's.

4301
03:20:55,740 --> 03:20:57,080
Stop, drop, and roll.

4302
03:21:00,180 --> 03:21:03,820
Alright, this should be here.

4303
03:21:07,520 --> 03:21:08,580
Alright, here we go.

4304
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:09,520
Alright, here we go.

4305
03:21:09,520 --> 03:21:11,300
Now to deposit my flame ores.

4306
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:13,820
The mother of flamelings.

4307
03:21:14,100 --> 03:21:16,360
I don't like the...

4308
03:21:16,360 --> 03:21:17,820
Oh, it is!

4309
03:21:17,980 --> 03:21:18,800
I knew it, guys!

4310
03:21:18,880 --> 03:21:19,500
Remember what I said?

4311
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:24,620
It had to be a giant worm, cause there were so many worms there!

4312
03:21:24,840 --> 03:21:26,500
I fucking knew it!

4313
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:29,080
Guys, I knew it!

4314
03:21:29,100 --> 03:21:29,820
I called it!

4315
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:31,940
God, I'm so smart.

4316
03:21:32,680 --> 03:21:34,160
I'm actually so smart.

4317
03:21:34,460 --> 03:21:36,380
I fucking made this game.

4318
03:21:43,340 --> 03:21:45,380
What are you beating up?

4319
03:21:47,360 --> 03:21:50,620
What are my monkeys beating up?

4320
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:53,320
Are you serious?

4321
03:21:56,660 --> 03:21:59,540
What the fuck were they beating?

4322
03:22:00,160 --> 03:22:02,000
Oh my god.

4323
03:22:02,820 --> 03:22:03,700
Like...

4324
03:22:03,700 --> 03:22:05,580
They were literally...

4325
03:22:05,580 --> 03:22:08,380
They were literally fucking beating up air.

4326
03:22:08,640 --> 03:22:10,280
That's actually crazy.

4327
03:22:11,240 --> 03:22:13,560
Alright, appointment time.

4328
03:22:14,520 --> 03:22:15,680
It's time.

4329
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:18,480
Jesus Christ.

4330
03:22:19,670 --> 03:22:20,160
Whip.

4331
03:22:21,220 --> 03:22:23,380
Oh my god.

4332
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:25,900
What are these fucking...

4333
03:22:25,900 --> 03:22:27,420
Why?!

4334
03:22:28,860 --> 03:22:29,840
Okay.

4335
03:22:30,180 --> 03:22:31,760
Why are they so strong?

4336
03:22:33,360 --> 03:22:34,100
Oh no.

4337
03:22:37,300 --> 03:22:38,220
Oh my god.

4338
03:22:38,340 --> 03:22:38,640
No.

4339
03:22:40,900 --> 03:22:42,140
Jesus Christ.

4340
03:22:42,320 --> 03:22:43,440
They're so strong!

4341
03:22:47,480 --> 03:22:48,080
Smack!

4342
03:22:49,180 --> 03:22:50,180
Oh no.

4343
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:52,040
Oh no.

4344
03:22:52,120 --> 03:22:52,740
Get out of here.

4345
03:22:53,820 --> 03:22:55,420
I'm gonna get rid of the babies first.

4346
03:22:58,360 --> 03:22:59,320
Baby down!

4347
03:22:59,320 --> 03:23:00,260
Baby down!

4348
03:23:04,350 --> 03:23:05,070
Okay.

4349
03:23:05,550 --> 03:23:06,270
Okay.

4350
03:23:06,390 --> 03:23:06,810
That's fine.

4351
03:23:07,870 --> 03:23:08,870
There we go.

4352
03:23:08,930 --> 03:23:09,290
We're fine.

4353
03:23:10,510 --> 03:23:12,290
There's too many babies.

4354
03:23:13,090 --> 03:23:14,910
Who is the dad?

4355
03:23:15,530 --> 03:23:16,910
Oh shit!

4356
03:23:21,490 --> 03:23:22,550
Oh my god.

4357
03:23:22,910 --> 03:23:24,370
The dad never came back.

4358
03:23:25,090 --> 03:23:26,510
Oh they're all dead.

4359
03:23:27,090 --> 03:23:29,370
Oh remember the three arms.

4360
03:23:30,790 --> 03:23:33,030
Oh thank god they're all dead.

4361
03:23:33,330 --> 03:23:34,950
That was so many babies.

4362
03:23:37,110 --> 03:23:37,770
Nice.

4363
03:23:38,970 --> 03:23:39,830
Got it.

4364
03:23:40,130 --> 03:23:41,850
Mother of flamelings.

4365
03:23:42,090 --> 03:23:43,430
Spring burst rivers.

4366
03:23:43,750 --> 03:23:44,930
True reeds in the ground.

4367
03:23:45,210 --> 03:23:47,630
Cold and lace elusive sources seldom found.

4368
03:23:48,010 --> 03:23:48,570
Whoa!

4369
03:23:50,130 --> 03:23:50,790
Alright.

4370
03:23:53,470 --> 03:23:54,130
Okay.

4371
03:23:54,690 --> 03:23:55,830
We did it.

4372
03:23:55,910 --> 03:23:56,790
We got them all.

4373
03:23:57,090 --> 03:23:58,970
Okay I'm gonna transport back there.

4374
03:23:59,370 --> 03:24:00,030
I'm gonna walk all the way there.

4375
03:24:00,110 --> 03:24:00,590
I'm too lazy.

4376
03:24:01,530 --> 03:24:03,430
Yeah I'm like thinking about the child support.

4377
03:24:03,630 --> 03:24:04,670
I'm like holy shit.

4378
03:24:05,670 --> 03:24:06,810
You got busy.

4379
03:24:11,550 --> 03:24:11,990
Okay.

4380
03:24:13,030 --> 03:24:14,730
Alright now we can go over here.

4381
03:24:15,050 --> 03:24:16,390
Oh there's a meditation area too.

4382
03:24:17,650 --> 03:24:18,090
Nice.

4383
03:24:18,330 --> 03:24:20,690
Oh no it's just mushrooms so I don't care about that.

4384
03:24:21,970 --> 03:24:23,130
Oh look he's sleeping.

4385
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:27,570
I'm gonna give this guy a bad time.

4386
03:24:31,520 --> 03:24:32,000
Yay!

4387
03:24:34,380 --> 03:24:34,860
Ow.

4388
03:24:35,460 --> 03:24:36,640
Guys why is he mad?

4389
03:24:36,960 --> 03:24:37,700
I don't understand.

4390
03:24:38,240 --> 03:24:39,200
It was just a prank.

4391
03:24:39,540 --> 03:24:40,600
Oh my god I killed his husband!

4392
03:24:42,900 --> 03:24:44,680
It's okay now they're in heaven together.

4393
03:24:46,480 --> 03:24:47,880
Oh there's the fourth cart!

4394
03:24:48,120 --> 03:24:48,800
There he is!

4395
03:24:53,200 --> 03:24:55,160
The rusty- Wait that's the cow!

4396
03:24:58,820 --> 03:24:59,660
Is he okay?

4397
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:04,800
Guys is he okay?

4398
03:25:05,960 --> 03:25:07,620
Why do you think he's okay?

4399
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:11,940
Cause he thinks he's okay guys.

4400
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:14,520
What do you mean?

4401
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:15,560
Oh

4402
03:25:19,140 --> 03:25:20,860
he didn't stop it!

4403
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:21,880
Oh no!

4404
03:25:22,820 --> 03:25:23,420
My face!

4405
03:25:24,140 --> 03:25:25,380
My face!

4406
03:25:25,400 --> 03:25:28,760
My monkeys can't do anything because...

4407
03:25:28,760 --> 03:25:30,400
Oh my god okay.

4408
03:25:30,980 --> 03:25:32,860
My beautiful face.

4409
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:39,920
I can't believe my monkeys didn't do anything because I was cutting a fucking throne cutscene.

4410
03:25:39,960 --> 03:25:40,720
That's so fucked!

4411
03:25:41,060 --> 03:25:43,340
That's actually so fucked.

4412
03:25:43,620 --> 03:25:48,520
I was stuck in a throne cutscene so it didn't do anything.

4413
03:25:48,860 --> 03:25:50,100
I'm so mad.

4414
03:25:51,540 --> 03:25:54,980
I'm actually so mad that that happened.

4415
03:25:57,700 --> 03:25:59,160
It's whipping time.

4416
03:26:00,800 --> 03:26:01,940
Oh shit.

4417
03:26:02,120 --> 03:26:02,940
Oh shit.

4418
03:26:02,940 --> 03:26:04,540
You can't do jack shit now.

4419
03:26:04,840 --> 03:26:05,440
That's right.

4420
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:07,300
That's fucking right.

4421
03:26:07,560 --> 03:26:09,020
You can't throw a horse.

4422
03:26:09,860 --> 03:26:11,680
You can't throw a horse.

4423
03:26:11,880 --> 03:26:13,240
That's fucking right.

4424
03:26:13,420 --> 03:26:14,220
Get whipped!

4425
03:26:14,500 --> 03:26:15,140
Get whipped!

4426
03:26:17,620 --> 03:26:19,000
But yeah what you gonna do?

4427
03:26:19,140 --> 03:26:20,140
Throw a horse?

4428
03:26:21,300 --> 03:26:22,580
I'm done horsing.

4429
03:26:22,680 --> 03:26:23,200
Oh I'm dead.

4430
03:26:23,280 --> 03:26:23,520
Okay.

4431
03:26:26,060 --> 03:26:29,740

4432
03:26:29,900 --> 03:26:31,400
You can't do shit now!

4433
03:26:31,860 --> 03:26:33,480
I'm immune to fire!

4434
03:26:35,960 --> 03:26:36,620
That's all!

4435
03:26:36,940 --> 03:26:37,560
Oh shit!

4436
03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:38,800
Okay.

4437
03:26:39,720 --> 03:26:40,360
Okay.

4438
03:26:42,280 --> 03:26:44,540
Doesn't matter if I'm immune to fire I guess.

4439
03:26:45,080 --> 03:26:47,400
It still fucking hurts though.

4440
03:26:49,160 --> 03:26:50,320
Oh shit!

4441
03:26:50,440 --> 03:26:51,840
Oh he backed up on me!

4442
03:26:52,500 --> 03:26:53,900
Bro every time.

4443
03:26:54,140 --> 03:26:55,220
That hurt.

4444
03:26:58,300 --> 03:26:59,280
Oh my god.

4445
03:27:02,260 --> 03:27:03,300
Okay that's fine.

4446
03:27:03,400 --> 03:27:03,800
That's fine.

4447
03:27:04,720 --> 03:27:08,020
Fire doesn't hurt me no more so you don't have to be scared Doki.

4448
03:27:10,860 --> 03:27:13,080
Fire brings no pain to you now.

4449
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:15,140
Haha that's fucking right.

4450
03:27:16,120 --> 03:27:17,080
That's nothing!

4451
03:27:17,320 --> 03:27:18,100
Oh shit!

4452
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:18,460
Okay.

4453
03:27:19,460 --> 03:27:21,240
Oh I don't know why I drank there!

4454
03:27:21,420 --> 03:27:22,460
I panicked!

4455
03:27:22,900 --> 03:27:23,900
I panicked!

4456
03:27:26,480 --> 03:27:28,060
Oh my god I panicked so hard.

4457
03:27:30,960 --> 03:27:31,460
Okay.

4458
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:31,840
Okay.

4459
03:27:31,900 --> 03:27:32,100
Heal.

4460
03:27:32,440 --> 03:27:33,940
This is my heal time.

4461
03:27:36,840 --> 03:27:37,580
Very nice.

4462
03:27:39,060 --> 03:27:40,060
Oh shit!

4463
03:27:40,140 --> 03:27:40,440
Okay.

4464
03:27:40,540 --> 03:27:40,900
That's fine.

4465
03:27:48,450 --> 03:27:48,950
Okay.

4466
03:27:50,050 --> 03:27:50,770
That's fine!

4467
03:27:53,990 --> 03:27:54,990
Oh fuck!

4468
03:27:55,050 --> 03:27:56,030
That is not fine!

4469
03:27:58,610 --> 03:27:59,110
Yes!

4470
03:27:59,630 --> 03:28:00,430
First try!

4471
03:28:00,510 --> 03:28:01,750
Oh he knocked me!

4472
03:28:01,970 --> 03:28:02,970
Down two!

4473
03:28:03,830 --> 03:28:04,990
Holy shit!

4474
03:28:05,010 --> 03:28:06,770
It still counts though.

4475
03:28:06,990 --> 03:28:08,210
It still counts.

4476
03:28:08,910 --> 03:28:09,750
First try.

4477
03:28:10,090 --> 03:28:10,830
Oh my god.

4478
03:28:10,870 --> 03:28:11,630
You guys know what I got?

4479
03:28:11,710 --> 03:28:12,730
Cold iron leaves.

4480
03:28:14,130 --> 03:28:16,150
My fucking favorite.

4481
03:28:19,010 --> 03:28:20,190
Oh my god.

4482
03:28:20,190 --> 03:28:21,810
I got my cold iron leaves.

4483
03:28:21,990 --> 03:28:22,370
Man.

4484
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:24,750
Oh my god.

4485
03:28:24,850 --> 03:28:25,750
Thank god.

4486
03:28:25,830 --> 03:28:27,270
I was looking for some more.

4487
03:28:28,450 --> 03:28:28,890
Hey there.

4488
03:28:29,050 --> 03:28:29,950
Are you dying?

4489
03:28:29,950 --> 03:28:30,030
Are you dying?

4490
03:28:34,380 --> 03:28:36,460
Iron leaves my favorite loot.

4491
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:53,110
Die for him.

4492
03:28:53,130 --> 03:28:53,930
Not for your friend.

4493
03:28:58,830 --> 03:28:59,470
It's okay.

4494
03:28:59,690 --> 03:29:01,230
He's like he's me now.

4495
03:29:01,710 --> 03:29:02,870
He's a part of me.

4496
03:29:06,650 --> 03:29:07,130
I'm not a part of me.

4497
03:29:08,170 --> 03:29:14,750
I'm not a part of me.

4498
03:29:14,750 --> 03:29:15,670
I'm not a part of me.

4499
03:29:15,670 --> 03:29:16,390
I'm not a part of me.

4500
03:29:16,390 --> 03:29:17,290
Oh shit!

4501
03:29:19,210 --> 03:29:20,250
Guys it's just okay.

4502
03:29:20,290 --> 03:29:20,950
It's just Kool-Aid.

4503
03:29:24,370 --> 03:29:26,250
Guys I can beat him if you want.

4504
03:29:26,710 --> 03:29:28,250
Oh no he is dying.

4505
03:29:29,630 --> 03:29:31,830
You are a good monkey.

4506
03:29:32,970 --> 03:29:34,250
Don't you dare touch me.

4507
03:29:34,490 --> 03:29:36,830
Don't you dare touch me.

4508
03:29:40,110 --> 03:29:42,290
Guys I thought you said he was napping.

4509
03:29:44,590 --> 03:29:47,310
I don't think he feels good right now.

4510
03:29:47,450 --> 03:29:48,610
I don't think he feels good right now.

4511
03:29:49,190 --> 03:29:51,010
Bro he doesn't even let me absorb him?

4512
03:29:51,230 --> 03:29:51,930
What the fuck?

4513
03:29:52,850 --> 03:29:54,190
I can't believe it.

4514
03:29:54,190 --> 03:29:55,750
Horse Bro lets me absorb him?

4515
03:29:56,070 --> 03:29:57,350
I can't believe it.

4516
03:29:57,350 --> 03:29:57,350
Horse Bro lets me absorb him?

4517
03:29:57,350 --> 03:29:57,950
Forever nap.

4518
03:29:57,950 --> 03:30:00,630
He doesn't feel good.

4519
03:30:00,690 --> 03:30:01,650
Should I heal up?

4520
03:30:01,810 --> 03:30:03,790
Should I go back to the shrine first?

4521
03:30:04,730 --> 03:30:06,410
Bro he's so selfish.

4522
03:30:07,150 --> 03:30:10,270
He didn't even let me absorb him and take his power.

4523
03:30:11,310 --> 03:30:13,310
He didn't even let me absorb him and take his power.

4524
03:30:13,310 --> 03:30:14,310
He didn't even let me absorb him and take his power.

4525
03:30:15,070 --> 03:30:19,350
He's so fucking selfish guys.

4526
03:30:19,970 --> 03:30:20,390
He's so fucking selfish guys.

4527
03:30:21,510 --> 03:30:23,650
Oh the new shrine is ahead.

4528
03:30:24,450 --> 03:30:27,550
Oh the new shrine is ahead.

4529
03:30:27,550 --> 03:30:28,590
I want him to fucking die.

4530
03:30:28,970 --> 03:30:30,270
I can't believe it.

4531
03:30:30,350 --> 03:30:33,170
If he's gonna die you should let me use his body.

4532
03:30:35,530 --> 03:30:37,050
It's so rude.

4533
03:30:45,970 --> 03:30:46,610
Alright.

4534
03:30:46,750 --> 03:30:47,190
Nice.

4535
03:30:47,270 --> 03:30:48,330
Open the door.

4536
03:30:53,740 --> 03:30:55,360
Don't you this is serious.

4537
03:30:55,480 --> 03:30:57,120
It was a very sad death.

4538
03:30:57,420 --> 03:31:00,800
I literally just met this guy like an hour ago.

4539
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:02,960
I have no connection to him.

4540
03:31:08,160 --> 03:31:10,700
He didn't do anything either.

4541
03:31:11,080 --> 03:31:11,280
He didn't do anything either.

4542
03:31:11,280 --> 03:31:12,680
I have more fucking.

4543
03:31:13,140 --> 03:31:16,100
I felt more for the horse than the bull.

4544
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:21,860
I felt more for the horse than the bull.

4545
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:22,960
I felt more for the horse than the bull.

4546
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:28,520
I felt more connection to our horsey fella.

4547
03:31:30,440 --> 03:31:31,880
And now he lets me.

4548
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:34,040
Oh guys you think that's the fuck.

4549
03:31:34,200 --> 03:31:35,200
No is that frog?

4550
03:31:35,540 --> 03:31:36,380
Fuck this.

4551
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:38,140
We gotta find a shrine.

4552
03:31:38,360 --> 03:31:40,700
We gotta find a shrine guys.

4553
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:42,900
We gotta find a shrine.

4554
03:31:42,900 --> 03:31:44,100
We gotta find a shrine.

4555
03:31:47,980 --> 03:31:49,500
Frog spotted.

4556
03:32:01,380 --> 03:32:02,140
What happened?

4557
03:32:03,680 --> 03:32:04,760
Too bad.

4558
03:32:05,060 --> 03:32:06,640
Get frogged.

4559
03:32:08,940 --> 03:32:09,700

Oh.

4562

03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:18,520
Oh.

4564
03:32:21,600 --> 03:32:21,900
I'm in a new area.

4565
03:32:22,040 --> 03:32:24,720
Guys I first tried like every boss today.

4566
03:32:25,300 --> 03:32:25,620
Guys I first tried like every boss today.

But like.

4568
03:32:28,040 --> 03:32:30,160
Doki the person stays so warm.

4569
03:32:30,500 --> 03:32:32,160
Oh my god.

Thank you.

4572
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:37,480
Guys I don't want to fight the frog.

4573
03:32:37,580 --> 03:32:39,520
We first tried like so many bosses today.

4574
03:32:42,640 --> 03:32:43,680
We first tried like so many bosses today.

4575
03:32:44,720 --> 03:32:47,600
We first tried so many bosses today.

4576
03:32:47,600 --> 03:32:48,040
Guys.

4577
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:52,660
I don't want to break the streak now.

4578
03:32:59,520 --> 03:33:00,240
Wait.

4579
03:33:00,680 --> 03:33:02,260
What the fuck.

4580
03:33:02,300 --> 03:33:02,500
Okay.

4581
03:33:04,300 --> 03:33:05,020
Alright.

4582
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:09,700
Where the fuck is the shrine?

4583
03:33:10,660 --> 03:33:11,380
Where the fuck is the shrine?

4584
03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:15,040
Where is it?

4585
03:33:18,140 --> 03:33:19,500
I guess it's up ahead?

4586
03:33:24,370 --> 03:33:24,970
Oh.

4587
03:33:26,830 --> 03:33:27,430
Yeah.

4588
03:33:29,170 --> 03:33:29,770
What?

4589
03:33:29,930 --> 03:33:30,470
Okay.

4590
03:33:30,570 --> 03:33:31,170
That's illegal.

4591
03:33:33,250 --> 03:33:34,510
That's actually fucking.

4592
03:33:34,910 --> 03:33:36,130
What the fuck.

4593
03:33:36,250 --> 03:33:38,090
Get away from me you freaks.

4594
03:33:39,370 --> 03:33:40,370
Oh shit.

4595
03:33:40,450 --> 03:33:40,710
Okay.

4596
03:33:43,270 --> 03:33:43,870
Alright.

4597
03:33:43,970 --> 03:33:44,270
Nice.

4598
03:33:46,130 --> 03:33:46,730
Alright.

4599
03:33:46,850 --> 03:33:48,590
We're just trying to find a shrine.

4600
03:33:52,310 --> 03:33:53,270
Anti-air.

4601
03:33:55,730 --> 03:33:56,650
Holy shit.

4602
03:33:56,650 --> 03:33:58,510
The fucking anti-air got me.

4603
03:33:58,870 --> 03:33:59,030
Holy shit.

4604
03:33:59,030 --> 03:33:59,030
The fucking anti-air got me.

4605
03:34:00,550 --> 03:34:01,030
Alright.

4606
03:34:01,170 --> 03:34:01,950
Let's see.

4607
03:34:02,050 --> 03:34:02,510
This way.

4608
03:34:06,440 --> 03:34:08,180
There has to be a shrine here, right?

4609
03:34:08,340 --> 03:34:09,280
Am I shrine-less?

4610
03:34:09,960 --> 03:34:10,880
Oh thank god.

4611
03:34:10,920 --> 03:34:11,160
Okay.

4612
03:34:11,200 --> 03:34:11,960
I'm not shrine-less.

4613
03:34:16,160 --> 03:34:16,640
Alright.

4614
03:34:16,760 --> 03:34:17,600
Do we fight the frog?

4615
03:34:17,820 --> 03:34:18,720
Or do we go forward?

4616
03:34:23,550 --> 03:34:24,610
I can upgrade.

4617
03:34:25,090 --> 03:34:27,270
The armor now to mythic with celestial ribbons.

4618
03:34:28,010 --> 03:34:29,810
Yeah but what if I get better armor?

4619
03:34:31,430 --> 03:34:31,910
Guys.

4620
03:34:31,970 --> 03:34:33,810
What if I get better armor though?

4621
03:34:34,450 --> 03:34:35,690
You guys don't know that.

4622
03:34:35,790 --> 03:34:37,050
What if I get better stuff?

4623
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:41,720
Frog time?

4624
03:34:42,060 --> 03:34:42,480
Okay.

4625
03:34:43,780 --> 03:34:44,640
Where is it?

4626
03:34:44,780 --> 03:34:45,080
Here?

4627
03:34:48,560 --> 03:34:49,280
Purge pit.

4628
03:34:49,460 --> 03:34:49,620
Wait.

4629
03:34:49,660 --> 03:34:50,360
Where is it?

4630
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:52,060
Is it cooling slope?

4631
03:34:52,400 --> 03:34:53,340
It has to be cooling slope.

4632
03:34:57,820 --> 03:34:58,300
Okay.

4633
03:34:58,320 --> 03:34:59,260
We gotta...

4634
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:01,860
We gotta go fight the frog.

4635
03:35:02,260 --> 03:35:03,880
Our streak had to end today.

4636
03:35:05,960 --> 03:35:07,680
Our streak ends today.

4637
03:35:12,260 --> 03:35:12,780
Alright.

4638
03:35:15,200 --> 03:35:16,280
Do we need to sleep?

4639
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:16,980
Well too bad.

4640
03:35:17,020 --> 03:35:18,440
We have to finish chapter 5.

4641
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:24,480
We've been playing Wooka for a month now.

4642
03:35:27,400 --> 03:35:27,920
Alright.

4643
03:35:28,060 --> 03:35:28,740
Here we go.

4644
03:35:29,720 --> 03:35:32,420
I still can't believe he didn't give me his soul.

4645
03:35:32,940 --> 03:35:33,700
I still can't believe he didn't give me his soul.

4646
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:38,100
The horse guy gave me his soul?

4647
03:35:38,540 --> 03:35:38,660
The horse guy gave me his soul?

4648
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:40,680
Like I thought that's your brother.

4649
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:42,700
You should want to be absorbed by me.

4650
03:35:46,160 --> 03:35:47,980
Champion thank you for the super chat.

4651
03:35:48,060 --> 03:35:48,420
Thank you.

4652
03:35:48,460 --> 03:35:49,120
Thank you.

4653
03:35:49,140 --> 03:35:51,700
This is an early therapy money for the frog.

4654
03:35:51,920 --> 03:35:52,880
Thank you for the super chat.

4655
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:53,460
Thank you.

4656
03:35:53,480 --> 03:35:54,100
Thank you.

4657
03:35:54,160 --> 03:35:54,440
Alright.

4658
03:35:54,800 --> 03:35:56,200
It's time for the frog.

4659
03:35:57,340 --> 03:35:58,300
Okay please.

4660
03:36:00,620 --> 03:36:01,100
Alright.

4661
03:36:01,300 --> 03:36:02,140
I see you.

4662
03:36:02,500 --> 03:36:04,520
I fucking see you.

4663
03:36:04,960 --> 03:36:06,540
No I used the wrong...

4664
03:36:06,540 --> 03:36:07,300
Okay.

4665
03:36:08,200 --> 03:36:08,680
Alright.

4666
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:09,380
Here we go.

4667
03:36:12,020 --> 03:36:12,740
Here we go.

4668
03:36:13,460 --> 03:36:14,480
There we go guys.

4669
03:36:14,900 --> 03:36:17,420
I used so much magic but there we go.

4670
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:21,320
Guys please immobilize him.

4671
03:36:21,360 --> 03:36:21,560
Please.

4672
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:21,860
Please.

4673
03:36:23,680 --> 03:36:24,360
Okay.

4674
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:25,400
That's fine.

4675
03:36:25,600 --> 03:36:26,640
I'll just whip him with you guys.

4676
03:36:26,760 --> 03:36:27,120
Whip.

4677
03:36:27,380 --> 03:36:28,060
Whip.

4678
03:36:28,840 --> 03:36:29,520
Whip.

4679
03:36:30,760 --> 03:36:33,700
Go forth my monkeys while I whip him.

4680
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:35,120
Go forth.

4681
03:36:35,120 --> 03:36:35,660
Whip.

4682
03:36:35,760 --> 03:36:36,300
Whip.

4683
03:36:36,300 --> 03:36:36,960
Whip.

4684
03:36:37,400 --> 03:36:38,900
First try.

4685
03:36:38,900 --> 03:36:40,460
Let's fucking go.

4686
03:36:40,480 --> 03:36:41,860
I'm a fucking gamer.

4687
03:36:45,060 --> 03:36:47,840
He got destroyed so hard.

4688
03:36:48,220 --> 03:36:50,000
This is the first time.

4689
03:36:50,020 --> 03:36:51,580
My first try to frog.

4690
03:36:52,340 --> 03:36:54,040
Holy shit.

4691
03:36:55,280 --> 03:37:01,700
This is actually the very first time I have managed to first try these fuckers.

4692
03:37:01,840 --> 03:37:03,380
Oh my god.

4693
03:37:03,460 --> 03:37:05,260
Thank god I'm not relatable.

4694
03:37:09,980 --> 03:37:11,820
I think that's it.

4695
03:37:11,860 --> 03:37:14,300
I just gotta go horse while everybody else is a monkey.

4696
03:37:15,280 --> 03:37:19,400
Where's the really strong armor that you guys telling me to get?

4697
03:37:19,440 --> 03:37:20,800
Is that it?

4698
03:37:23,180 --> 03:37:24,260
And I took his kids.

4699
03:37:24,500 --> 03:37:25,460
That's fucking right.

4700
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:30,140
He got jumped by a gang of monkeys.

4701
03:37:31,740 --> 03:37:32,820
What the fuck?

4702
03:37:32,840 --> 03:37:34,740
You guys fucking lied to me.

4703
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:38,840
You guys were like, oh donkey, there's armor here.

4704
03:37:43,080 --> 03:37:48,100
And it's horse versus just frog.

4705
03:37:48,420 --> 03:37:49,060
Okay.

4706
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:53,480
Guess I go back to the other area.

4707
03:37:54,360 --> 03:37:56,760
The armor is the lesson we learned.

4708
03:38:01,950 --> 03:38:02,530
Thanks.

4709
03:38:02,590 --> 03:38:04,530
Thanks Mel for the therapy money again.

4710
03:38:06,050 --> 03:38:07,610
No refunds.

4711
03:38:07,770 --> 03:38:10,870
No refunds.

4712
03:38:11,210 --> 03:38:12,250
Poor guy.

4713
03:38:12,430 --> 03:38:13,350
I got scammed.

4714
03:38:26,140 --> 03:38:26,720
Alright.

4715
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:27,360
Here we go.

4716
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:33,040
Alright.

4717
03:38:33,060 --> 03:38:33,420
Where am I?

4718
03:38:33,420 --> 03:38:34,980
But the views, Doki!

4719
03:38:35,580 --> 03:38:38,500
Now you won't get views for intentionally throwing!

4720
03:38:39,360 --> 03:38:39,760
Alright.

4721
03:38:40,960 --> 03:38:41,780
Where do I go?

4722
03:38:42,040 --> 03:38:42,200
Wait.

4723
03:38:42,220 --> 03:38:43,000
Left or right chat?

4724
03:38:44,040 --> 03:38:45,180
Do they all go the same way?

4725
03:38:45,200 --> 03:38:45,420
Oh wait.

4726
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:46,300
It all goes the same way.

4727
03:38:46,500 --> 03:38:46,900
Nevermind.

4728
03:38:47,520 --> 03:38:50,180
I just realized it all leads to the main stage.

4729
03:38:50,460 --> 03:38:50,580
Wait.

4730
03:38:50,620 --> 03:38:50,960
Does it?

4731
03:38:51,500 --> 03:38:52,340
No it doesn't.

4732
03:38:53,160 --> 03:38:53,560
Wait.

4733
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:54,100
Left or right?

4734
03:38:54,800 --> 03:38:55,920
Oh right is meditation.

4735
03:38:56,320 --> 03:38:56,580
Okay.

4736
03:38:58,760 --> 03:38:59,160
Yeah.

4737
03:38:59,280 --> 03:38:59,740
I just saw it.

4738
03:38:59,840 --> 03:39:00,720
I was like, wait.

4739
03:39:00,860 --> 03:39:01,060
No.

4740
03:39:01,060 --> 03:39:01,880
This is meditating.

4741
03:39:02,380 --> 03:39:04,580
Am I gonna just look at a fucking rock?

4742
03:39:05,220 --> 03:39:06,380
In my meditation?

4743
03:39:06,720 --> 03:39:07,640
What am I looking at?

4744
03:39:09,300 --> 03:39:10,840
How is that like my scene?

4745
03:39:11,260 --> 03:39:12,020
Oh I guess.

4746
03:39:12,140 --> 03:39:12,920
Oh they're all buddhas.

4747
03:39:12,980 --> 03:39:13,660
That's why.

4748
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:18,120
I have finally beat the monkey.

4749
03:39:18,240 --> 03:39:19,160
The frog.

4750
03:39:19,800 --> 03:39:23,780
All it took was 600 monkeys and one giant horse.

4751
03:39:32,220 --> 03:39:33,180
It's meditation.

4752
03:39:33,520 --> 03:39:34,440
Oh yeah.

4753
03:39:34,520 --> 03:39:36,540
You're supposed to close your eyes when you meditate.

4754
03:39:36,560 --> 03:39:37,000
I forgot.

4755
03:39:37,500 --> 03:39:40,800
Can you guys tell I haven't meditated in a long time?

4756
03:39:41,980 --> 03:39:48,480
I had a PE teacher in high school that would like, where we would meditate as a sport.

4757
03:39:48,900 --> 03:39:51,060
Not sport for PE, but for PE class.

4758
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:55,200
We would meditate for PE class.

4759
03:39:55,480 --> 03:39:57,460
But I haven't done that in a long ass time.

4760
03:40:02,400 --> 03:40:02,920
Alright.

4761
03:40:02,940 --> 03:40:03,540
Let's see.

4762
03:40:04,160 --> 03:40:04,740
I'll put...

4763
03:40:06,780 --> 03:40:07,340
Uh...

4764
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:10,560
Yeah.

4765
03:40:10,620 --> 03:40:10,980
I'll put...

4766
03:40:11,860 --> 03:40:12,860
I'll put that here.

4767
03:40:16,930 --> 03:40:17,490
Nice.

4768
03:40:19,150 --> 03:40:21,450
Too angry to meditate.

4769
03:40:21,950 --> 03:40:25,370
Wouldn't that mean I need to meditate because I'm too angry?

4770
03:40:29,990 --> 03:40:30,550
Alright.

4771
03:40:30,610 --> 03:40:31,270
Down we go.

4772
03:40:34,110 --> 03:40:34,670
Absorb.

4773
03:40:35,750 --> 03:40:38,110
I must have a lot of will right now.

4774
03:40:38,430 --> 03:40:40,590
I haven't used it at all to craft stuff.

4775
03:40:41,630 --> 03:40:42,150
Okay.

4776
03:40:42,190 --> 03:40:43,330
This feels like a boss fight.

4777
03:40:43,730 --> 03:40:44,570
Down we go.

4778
03:40:47,870 --> 03:40:49,510
This has to be a boss fight.

4779
03:40:49,570 --> 03:40:50,150
There's no way.

4780
03:40:54,970 --> 03:40:55,490
Yeah.

4781
03:40:55,570 --> 03:40:56,430
I'm just like...

4782
03:40:56,430 --> 03:40:58,330
It's literally a giant open area.

4783
03:41:01,710 --> 03:41:03,250
Oh my god.

4784
03:41:03,370 --> 03:41:04,450
It's a Sarn.

4785
03:41:06,410 --> 03:41:08,290
He's here for revenge.

4786
03:41:09,490 --> 03:41:10,550
He's here for revenge.

4787
03:41:13,890 --> 03:41:14,570
He's back.

4788
03:41:21,950 --> 03:41:22,470
Wait.

4789
03:41:22,550 --> 03:41:23,710
There's a family in there?

4790
03:41:26,190 --> 03:41:27,390
What the fuck?

4791
03:41:29,830 --> 03:41:31,050
There's a family?

4792
03:41:31,430 --> 03:41:31,750
Wait.

4793
03:41:31,770 --> 03:41:31,990
No.

4794
03:41:31,990 --> 03:41:32,450
It's them.

4795
03:41:32,570 --> 03:41:33,570
It's the same family.

4796
03:41:36,550 --> 03:41:37,070
Okay.

4797
03:41:37,970 --> 03:41:38,490
Okay.

4798
03:41:38,590 --> 03:41:38,950
That's fine.

4799
03:41:39,630 --> 03:41:41,110
It's two of them again.

4800
03:41:41,170 --> 03:41:41,890
Oh my god.

4801
03:41:41,930 --> 03:41:42,430
This is bullshit.

4802
03:41:42,690 --> 03:41:45,250
Please do not hit the shield monkeys.

4803
03:41:45,250 --> 03:41:45,510
Please.

4804
03:41:47,930 --> 03:41:50,290
She did not hit the shield.

4805
03:41:52,610 --> 03:41:53,130
Please.

4806
03:41:53,130 --> 03:41:54,710
For the love of god.

4807
03:41:55,190 --> 03:41:55,710
Monkeys.

4808
03:41:55,830 --> 03:41:58,990
I need you guys to like work together.

4809
03:42:00,410 --> 03:42:01,610
I whip the lady.

4810
03:42:01,690 --> 03:42:02,750
You guys get the guy.

4811
03:42:02,910 --> 03:42:03,710
You guys get the man.

4812
03:42:09,930 --> 03:42:10,450
Okay.

4813
03:42:10,450 --> 03:42:10,970
Wait.

4814
03:42:11,010 --> 03:42:11,270
No.

4815
03:42:11,470 --> 03:42:12,550
They're balls now.

4816
03:42:14,710 --> 03:42:15,150
Okay.

4817
03:42:16,410 --> 03:42:16,850
Okay.

4818
03:42:16,950 --> 03:42:17,610
We can dodge this.

4819
03:42:18,450 --> 03:42:18,890
Nice.

4820
03:42:21,710 --> 03:42:23,210
What am I supposed to do?

4821
03:42:23,290 --> 03:42:23,970
Just let them roll?

4822
03:42:24,190 --> 03:42:24,550
Like...

4823
03:42:26,790 --> 03:42:27,670
Like separate.

4824
03:42:28,270 --> 03:42:29,110
Get a divorce.

4825
03:42:34,540 --> 03:42:35,200
I guess.

4826
03:42:36,560 --> 03:42:37,440
Oh shit.

4827
03:42:37,500 --> 03:42:38,540
What the fuck was that?

4828
03:42:39,820 --> 03:42:40,260
Oh.

4829
03:42:40,260 --> 03:42:40,700
Okay.

4830
03:42:40,760 --> 03:42:41,660
That's what it is.

4831
03:42:41,760 --> 03:42:42,000
Okay.

4832
03:42:42,600 --> 03:42:43,040
Please.

4833
03:42:43,120 --> 03:42:43,740
Get a divorce.

4834
03:42:46,180 --> 03:42:46,820
Whip.

4835
03:42:46,820 --> 03:42:47,460
Whip.

4836
03:42:47,560 --> 03:42:48,200
Whip.

4837
03:42:48,200 --> 03:42:48,840
Whip.

4838
03:42:48,840 --> 03:42:49,460
Oh shit.

4839
03:42:50,080 --> 03:42:50,720
Whip.

4840
03:42:50,920 --> 03:42:51,560
No.

4841
03:42:51,620 --> 03:42:51,820
Okay.

4842
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:55,280
Jesus Christ.

4843
03:42:56,180 --> 03:42:56,820
Okay.

4844
03:42:57,180 --> 03:42:57,820
Alright.

4845
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:58,320
Now I...

4846
03:42:58,320 --> 03:43:00,820
I'm definitely gonna use the wind as like...

4847
03:43:02,020 --> 03:43:02,980
As like...

4848
03:43:03,300 --> 03:43:04,820
What is the guy doing?

4849
03:43:05,360 --> 03:43:07,060
Is he just watching?

4850
03:43:07,660 --> 03:43:08,900
I'm just thinking like...

4851
03:43:08,900 --> 03:43:09,900
What is he doing?

4852
03:43:10,160 --> 03:43:11,560
I'm just gonna use the...

4853
03:43:13,620 --> 03:43:14,260
Okay.

4854
03:43:14,780 --> 03:43:14,980
Nice.

4855
03:43:14,980 --> 03:43:15,120
Okay.

4856
03:43:16,300 --> 03:43:17,960
He's literally just watching.

4857
03:43:18,220 --> 03:43:18,700
Like...

4858
03:43:20,020 --> 03:43:20,920
Oh shit.

4859
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:23,640
She like turtled.

4860
03:43:26,160 --> 03:43:27,280
What the fuck?

4861
03:43:27,340 --> 03:43:29,220
He's like turtling right now.

4862
03:43:34,530 --> 03:43:35,610
Oh shit.

4863
03:43:35,730 --> 03:43:36,050
Okay.

4864
03:43:36,130 --> 03:43:36,990
That's what he did.

4865
03:43:37,870 --> 03:43:38,710
Oh no.

4866
03:43:38,770 --> 03:43:39,150
What?

4867
03:43:42,610 --> 03:43:43,150
Okay.

4868
03:43:43,310 --> 03:43:43,750
That's fine.

4869
03:43:43,750 --> 03:43:46,030
Oh I need... Oh I need to get out of there.

4870
03:43:46,130 --> 03:43:46,310
Okay.

4871
03:43:46,390 --> 03:43:46,930
That's fine.

4872
03:43:46,970 --> 03:43:47,270
That's fine.

4873
03:43:47,390 --> 03:43:47,990
That's fine.

4874
03:43:48,090 --> 03:43:48,850
I'm gonna heal.

4875
03:43:50,690 --> 03:43:51,630
I'm gonna heal.

4876
03:43:54,850 --> 03:43:55,810
She doesn't know.

4877
03:43:55,890 --> 03:43:56,630
She's so stupid.

4878
03:43:57,870 --> 03:43:58,670
Oh fuck.

4879
03:43:58,750 --> 03:43:59,630
I'm so stupid.

4880
03:44:02,950 --> 03:44:04,190
This is not fair.

4881
03:44:05,370 --> 03:44:06,150
Oh fuck.

4882
03:44:06,230 --> 03:44:06,470
Okay.

4883
03:44:06,530 --> 03:44:07,290
That was an accident.

4884
03:44:07,550 --> 03:44:08,210
By the way.

4885
03:44:09,590 --> 03:44:09,990
Okay.

4886
03:44:10,370 --> 03:44:11,010
That's fine.

4887
03:44:11,010 --> 03:44:11,690
Wait.

4888
03:44:11,770 --> 03:44:12,590
Why does it hurt me?

4889
03:44:12,810 --> 03:44:13,170
Okay.

4890
03:44:13,290 --> 03:44:14,710
But that's an impact.

4891
03:44:14,890 --> 03:44:15,070
Okay.

4892
03:44:15,190 --> 03:44:16,270
I was gonna say.

4893
03:44:16,450 --> 03:44:16,810
Wait.

4894
03:44:16,870 --> 03:44:17,770
Why does it hurt me?

4895
03:44:17,810 --> 03:44:20,450
But she's still like smacking me.

4896
03:44:20,530 --> 03:44:21,150
So like...

4897
03:44:21,870 --> 03:44:22,950
It doesn't matter.

4898
03:44:24,750 --> 03:44:25,670
I was gonna say.

4899
03:44:25,790 --> 03:44:26,350
Oh my god.

4900
03:44:26,410 --> 03:44:27,110
I'm fucking...

4901
03:44:27,530 --> 03:44:28,410
I'm gonna be fine.

4902
03:44:32,650 --> 03:44:33,010
Okay.

4903
03:44:33,010 --> 03:44:33,590
That's fine.

4904
03:44:36,030 --> 03:44:36,390
Okay.

4905
03:44:36,470 --> 03:44:36,670
Nice.

4906
03:44:38,090 --> 03:44:38,450
Alright.

4907
03:44:38,550 --> 03:44:38,970
That's fine.

4908
03:44:41,450 --> 03:44:42,390
She's so low.

4909
03:44:43,610 --> 03:44:44,570
Oh shit.

4910
03:44:45,330 --> 03:44:45,970
I mean.

4911
03:44:45,990 --> 03:44:46,930
She's literally one hit.

4912
03:44:47,010 --> 03:44:48,190
I'm gonna heal just in case.

4913
03:44:48,210 --> 03:44:48,610
But okay.

4914
03:44:52,670 --> 03:44:55,350
Blood force trauma still got me.

4915
03:44:56,330 --> 03:44:56,810
Nice.

4916
03:44:57,950 --> 03:44:58,770
You got...

4917
03:44:58,770 --> 03:44:59,450
Wait.

4918
03:44:59,510 --> 03:44:59,770
What?

4919
03:45:00,930 --> 03:45:01,410
Oh.

4920
03:45:01,470 --> 03:45:01,770
Oh.

4921
03:45:01,830 --> 03:45:02,270
They're dead.

4922
03:45:02,690 --> 03:45:03,170
Nice.

4923
03:45:04,110 --> 03:45:04,910
I was like.

4924
03:45:05,030 --> 03:45:05,210
Wait.

4925
03:45:05,290 --> 03:45:05,530
What?

4926
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:07,250
She just disappeared.

4927
03:45:07,890 --> 03:45:08,650
First try.

4928
03:45:08,710 --> 03:45:09,250
Let's go.

4929
03:45:11,070 --> 03:45:12,530
We made them get a divorce.

4930
03:45:12,650 --> 03:45:13,370
Let's fucking go.

4931
03:45:15,890 --> 03:45:16,890
Where did I come from?

4932
03:45:18,690 --> 03:45:19,070
Oh.

4933
03:45:19,290 --> 03:45:20,330
This is where we go.

4934
03:45:21,810 --> 03:45:22,190
Yeah.

4935
03:45:22,210 --> 03:45:22,790
I was gonna say.

4936
03:45:22,910 --> 03:45:23,210
Like.

4937
03:45:23,330 --> 03:45:24,350
Why did he...

4938
03:45:24,350 --> 03:45:26,150
They fucking turtle there.

4939
03:45:28,350 --> 03:45:28,730
No.

4940
03:45:28,730 --> 03:45:29,350
This is where I...

4941
03:45:29,350 --> 03:45:29,570
No.

4942
03:45:29,630 --> 03:45:30,670
This is not where I came from.

4943
03:45:31,270 --> 03:45:31,650
Alright.

4944
03:45:35,210 --> 03:45:36,930
He's just minding his own business.

4945
03:45:37,070 --> 03:45:38,270
I don't like the way he stands.

4946
03:45:39,670 --> 03:45:40,430
Oh shit.

4947
03:45:40,850 --> 03:45:41,850
That's not a lot of damage.

4948
03:45:42,570 --> 03:45:42,730
That's not a lot.

4949
03:45:44,230 --> 03:45:45,170
Did they run?

4950
03:45:45,430 --> 03:45:45,690
No.

4951
03:45:45,890 --> 03:45:46,450
They like.

4952
03:45:46,510 --> 03:45:47,250
They died.

4953
03:45:48,350 --> 03:45:48,850
Guys.

4954
03:45:48,850 --> 03:45:49,350
Oh.

4955
03:45:49,370 --> 03:45:49,850
Thank god.

4956
03:45:49,870 --> 03:45:50,690
I thought I got stuck.

4957
03:45:51,630 --> 03:45:52,130
Oh.

4958
03:45:52,150 --> 03:45:53,330
Read the lore of the guard.

4959
03:45:55,130 --> 03:45:55,630
What?

4960
03:45:56,570 --> 03:45:57,710
Is there something special?

4961
03:46:01,560 --> 03:46:02,560
Are they the kings?

4962
03:46:04,780 --> 03:46:05,820
King and fish.

4963
03:46:05,940 --> 03:46:06,180
No.

4964
03:46:06,280 --> 03:46:06,720
They're not.

4965
03:46:07,380 --> 03:46:08,360
Which one are they?

4966
03:46:09,600 --> 03:46:10,600
Which one?

4967
03:46:10,600 --> 03:46:11,740
Are they trees?

4968
03:46:13,020 --> 03:46:13,540
Oh.

4969
03:46:13,540 --> 03:46:14,540
There they are.

4970
03:46:14,720 --> 03:46:14,920
Oh.

4971
03:46:14,920 --> 03:46:15,460
There they are.

4972
03:46:15,660 --> 03:46:18,880
A beauty weds a beast so vile with horns and fans.

4973
03:46:19,220 --> 03:46:21,460
In love's embrace they form a pair.

4974
03:46:21,660 --> 03:46:22,060
Oh.

4975
03:46:23,180 --> 03:46:23,880
I mean.

4976
03:46:23,920 --> 03:46:24,740
They're both ugly.

4977
03:46:24,880 --> 03:46:25,280
Like.

4978
03:46:25,360 --> 03:46:26,140
What do you mean?

4979
03:46:26,360 --> 03:46:26,860
I'm sorry.

4980
03:46:28,420 --> 03:46:28,940
Like.

4981
03:46:29,140 --> 03:46:30,500
She wasn't that pretty.

4982
03:46:30,700 --> 03:46:30,960
Like.

4983
03:46:30,960 --> 03:46:31,580
I don't understand.

4984
03:46:35,060 --> 03:46:37,080
So they were both...

4985
03:46:37,080 --> 03:46:38,160
I mean.

4986
03:46:38,240 --> 03:46:38,760
Like.

4987
03:46:40,260 --> 03:46:41,240
They were like.

4988
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:42,200
A beauty weds.

4989
03:46:42,340 --> 03:46:42,560
Like.

4990
03:46:42,700 --> 03:46:43,880
When I fought her.

4991
03:46:44,060 --> 03:46:44,600
She was.

4992
03:46:46,280 --> 03:46:47,320
Donkey dancing.

4993
03:46:51,180 --> 03:46:51,700
Like.

4994
03:46:55,640 --> 03:46:56,160
Wait.

4995
03:46:56,240 --> 03:46:56,920
Was she topless?

4996
03:46:57,580 --> 03:46:58,100
Oh.

4997
03:46:58,100 --> 03:46:58,620
No.

4998
03:46:58,720 --> 03:46:59,160
She was.

4999
03:46:59,260 --> 03:46:59,940
Top takes bottom.

5000
03:47:00,020 --> 03:47:00,880
Bottom takes top.

5001
03:47:01,360 --> 03:47:02,200
Tremble in fear.

5002
03:47:02,340 --> 03:47:04,080
But the concubines stood tall and afraid.

5003
03:47:05,140 --> 03:47:06,040
Zoo finally.

5004
03:47:06,300 --> 03:47:08,740
Beauty is the eye of the beast.

5005
03:47:08,760 --> 03:47:09,220
Oh.

5006
03:47:09,220 --> 03:47:09,520
There.

5007
03:47:09,760 --> 03:47:10,540
But like.

5008
03:47:10,640 --> 03:47:11,580
It literally says.

5009
03:47:11,720 --> 03:47:14,280
A beauty weds a beast so vile.

5010
03:47:14,380 --> 03:47:14,540
I'm like.

5011
03:47:14,600 --> 03:47:15,380
That's fucked up.

5012
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:16,260
I was like.

5013
03:47:16,480 --> 03:47:17,780
He wasn't that bad.

5014
03:47:18,200 --> 03:47:18,820
I mean.

5015
03:47:18,860 --> 03:47:19,980
You both look like.

5016
03:47:20,020 --> 03:47:21,340
You both look like monsters.

5017
03:47:21,700 --> 03:47:22,140
Like.

5018
03:47:27,600 --> 03:47:29,680
You both look like monsters.

5019
03:47:29,700 --> 03:47:30,560
So I don't understand.

5020
03:47:36,150 --> 03:47:36,670
Okay.

5021
03:47:36,770 --> 03:47:37,390
Let's see.

5022
03:47:37,510 --> 03:47:38,070
This way.

5023
03:47:39,330 --> 03:47:40,670
Can we beat up this guy?

5024
03:47:45,900 --> 03:47:46,420
Yeah.

5025
03:47:46,660 --> 03:47:47,180
Oh.

5026
03:47:47,300 --> 03:47:47,560
No.

5027
03:47:49,200 --> 03:47:49,920
It's fine.

5028
03:47:50,080 --> 03:47:50,360
Oh.

5029
03:47:50,580 --> 03:47:51,300
He's angry.

5030
03:47:51,460 --> 03:47:52,920
He's so fucking angry.

5031
03:47:53,700 --> 03:47:54,220
Oh.

5032
03:47:54,400 --> 03:47:55,200
Wrong one.

5033
03:47:55,400 --> 03:47:56,060
It's fine.

5034
03:47:56,100 --> 03:47:56,860
I'll just beat up your brother.

5035
03:47:58,360 --> 03:47:58,880
Donkey.

5036
03:47:59,140 --> 03:47:59,660
Kyle.

5037
03:47:59,780 --> 03:48:01,560
Thank you for the super chat.

5038
03:48:01,620 --> 03:48:02,200
Thank you.

5039
03:48:03,680 --> 03:48:04,200
Oh.

5040
03:48:04,240 --> 03:48:04,700
Donkey.

5041
03:48:04,820 --> 03:48:07,140
You didn't learn from your worm incident.

5042
03:48:07,420 --> 03:48:07,940
Donkey.

5043
03:48:08,360 --> 03:48:11,080
Don't you remember what happened with the worm?

5044
03:48:13,080 --> 03:48:13,600
Kyle.

5045
03:48:13,600 --> 03:48:15,560
Thank you for the super chat.

5046
03:48:15,700 --> 03:48:16,240
Thank you.

5047
03:48:16,260 --> 03:48:17,060
Thank you.

5048
03:48:21,340 --> 03:48:21,880
Alright.

5049
03:48:23,300 --> 03:48:23,840
Yay.

5050
03:48:24,040 --> 03:48:24,560
Shrine.

5051
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:25,000
Oh.

5052
03:48:25,020 --> 03:48:25,960
The shrine is on fire.

5053
03:48:27,860 --> 03:48:28,400
Yeah.

5054
03:48:28,740 --> 03:48:29,280
Donkey.

5055
03:48:31,840 --> 03:48:32,380
Alright.

5056
03:48:32,560 --> 03:48:33,300
Down we go.

5057
03:48:33,420 --> 03:48:33,580
Oh.

5058
03:48:33,580 --> 03:48:33,900
Shit.

5059
03:48:33,980 --> 03:48:34,300
Wait.

5060
03:48:34,380 --> 03:48:35,740
That looks like a boss up there.

5061
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:36,980
That.

5062
03:48:37,200 --> 03:48:39,520
That looks like a fucking boss up there.

5063
03:48:39,960 --> 03:48:40,500
Oh.

5064
03:48:41,560 --> 03:48:42,120
I mean.

5065
03:48:42,200 --> 03:48:42,920
He's guarding something.

5066
03:48:43,160 --> 03:48:43,360
No.

5067
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:44,160
Maybe he's not.

5068
03:48:44,240 --> 03:48:46,780
I think like the boss is like after that.

5069
03:48:46,940 --> 03:48:47,760
Has to be.

5070
03:48:48,200 --> 03:48:48,560
Right?

5071
03:48:50,140 --> 03:48:50,500
Oh.

5072
03:48:50,600 --> 03:48:50,880
Shit.

5073
03:48:50,980 --> 03:48:51,220
Okay.

5074
03:48:51,880 --> 03:48:52,400
It's fine.

5075
03:48:52,480 --> 03:48:53,520
They're doing it one by one.

5076
03:48:53,580 --> 03:48:54,720
So I can do... No.

5077
03:48:54,740 --> 03:48:55,080
They're not.

5078
03:48:55,120 --> 03:48:55,460
They're not.

5079
03:48:56,220 --> 03:48:56,760
They're not.

5080
03:48:58,500 --> 03:49:00,220
It looked like that in the beginning.

5081
03:49:00,360 --> 03:49:01,400
They're doing it two by two.

5082
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:02,380
Which is also fine.

5083
03:49:02,540 --> 03:49:04,580
I don't mind two by two.

5084
03:49:04,740 --> 03:49:05,100
Guys.

5085
03:49:05,260 --> 03:49:05,720
I don't mind.

5086
03:49:08,300 --> 03:49:09,320
Oh my god.

5087
03:49:09,380 --> 03:49:09,720
Okay.

5088
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:10,940
One sec guys.

5089
03:49:12,560 --> 03:49:12,960
Okay.

5090
03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:13,340
Nice.

5091
03:49:13,380 --> 03:49:14,640
I got a curious too.

5092
03:49:15,420 --> 03:49:16,160
Out of that.

5093
03:49:17,740 --> 03:49:18,140
Okay.

5094
03:49:18,140 --> 03:49:18,580
There we go.

5095
03:49:19,140 --> 03:49:19,540
Oh.

5096
03:49:19,600 --> 03:49:19,900
Fuck.

5097
03:49:19,960 --> 03:49:20,240
Okay.

5098
03:49:20,380 --> 03:49:21,600
This is not good for me.

5099
03:49:23,500 --> 03:49:23,900
Smack.

5100
03:49:24,160 --> 03:49:24,280
Oh.

5101
03:49:24,420 --> 03:49:25,620
This is not good for me too.

5102
03:49:26,100 --> 03:49:26,500
Guys.

5103
03:49:26,620 --> 03:49:27,020
Please.

5104
03:49:27,180 --> 03:49:27,540
Please.

5105
03:49:28,400 --> 03:49:29,640
One at a time.

5106
03:49:29,800 --> 03:49:30,200
Please.

5107
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:31,580
This is not fair.

5108
03:49:34,400 --> 03:49:34,800
Okay.

5109
03:49:37,420 --> 03:49:38,900
We can get this guy.

5110
03:49:39,060 --> 03:49:39,460
What?

5111
03:49:40,500 --> 03:49:41,080
I can't see you.

5112
03:49:41,200 --> 03:49:42,840
My camera doesn't even reach you.

5113
03:49:45,500 --> 03:49:45,860
Bam.

5114
03:49:47,080 --> 03:49:47,440
Okay.

5115
03:49:47,440 --> 03:49:48,020
Never mind.

5116
03:49:48,200 --> 03:49:48,380
Okay.

5117
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:48,580
No.

5118
03:49:48,640 --> 03:49:49,360
You can be... Okay.

5119
03:49:49,420 --> 03:49:49,620
Okay.

5120
03:49:49,640 --> 03:49:49,820
Alright.

5121
03:49:49,940 --> 03:49:50,420
You win.

5122
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:50,800
Alright.

5123
03:49:50,880 --> 03:49:51,500
You win those.

5124
03:49:54,480 --> 03:49:54,880
We're fine.

5125
03:49:56,060 --> 03:49:56,960
This should kill him.

5126
03:49:57,420 --> 03:49:57,780
Nice.

5127
03:49:59,080 --> 03:50:00,080
I can take them.

5128
03:50:00,760 --> 03:50:01,120
Alright.

5129
03:50:01,180 --> 03:50:02,060
That should be all of them.

5130
03:50:02,500 --> 03:50:02,860
Absorb.

5131
03:50:06,060 --> 03:50:06,420
Yeah.

5132
03:50:06,480 --> 03:50:07,360
But I'm the main character.

5133
03:50:07,520 --> 03:50:08,780
I should be allowed to do that.

5134
03:50:11,000 --> 03:50:11,480
Chest.

5135
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:15,600
Oh.

5136
03:50:15,700 --> 03:50:15,880
Nice.

5137
03:50:16,160 --> 03:50:18,180
The Bull King's Iron Horn.

5138
03:50:19,840 --> 03:50:20,320
Oh.

5139
03:50:20,340 --> 03:50:21,480
And a Celestial Ribbon.

5140
03:50:21,800 --> 03:50:22,280
Okay.

5141
03:50:22,320 --> 03:50:22,940
I see you.

5142
03:50:23,200 --> 03:50:23,960
You know what?

5143
03:50:25,400 --> 03:50:27,260
I'm going to do something funky.

5144
03:50:28,660 --> 03:50:29,800
I'm going to stand up here.

5145
03:50:32,120 --> 03:50:32,600
Okay.

5146
03:50:32,860 --> 03:50:33,340
Oh.

5147
03:50:33,400 --> 03:50:33,800
Shit.

5148
03:50:34,360 --> 03:50:34,840
Oh.

5149
03:50:34,860 --> 03:50:35,180
Okay.

5150
03:50:35,240 --> 03:50:35,580
That's fine.

5151
03:50:35,660 --> 03:50:36,000
That's fine.

5152
03:50:36,780 --> 03:50:37,260
Oh.

5153
03:50:37,260 --> 03:50:38,360
That's not fine.

5154
03:50:38,360 --> 03:50:38,760
Oh.

5155
03:50:38,760 --> 03:50:38,760
That's not fine.

5156
03:50:38,760 --> 03:50:39,200
Guys.

5157
03:50:39,520 --> 03:50:40,080
Guys.

5158
03:50:40,120 --> 03:50:41,440
I don't think that was fine.

5159
03:50:41,740 --> 03:50:43,860
I didn't think that was fine.

5160
03:50:44,780 --> 03:50:45,900
Holy fuck.

5161
03:50:46,060 --> 03:50:46,480
Okay.

5162
03:50:46,560 --> 03:50:49,960
I did not realize how fucking tanky he was.

5163
03:50:52,560 --> 03:50:53,120
Alright.

5164
03:50:53,180 --> 03:50:53,680
That's okay.

5165
03:50:55,220 --> 03:50:55,980
We're okay.

5166
03:50:56,260 --> 03:50:56,700
Oh.

5167
03:50:56,700 --> 03:50:56,820
Wait.

5168
03:50:56,880 --> 03:50:57,940
He's a mini-boss.

5169
03:50:57,980 --> 03:50:58,840
What the fuck?

5170
03:50:58,900 --> 03:50:59,660
Then I should just...

5171
03:50:59,660 --> 03:51:01,200
I should just use my abilities.

5172
03:51:04,140 --> 03:51:04,700
Easy.

5173
03:51:05,020 --> 03:51:06,160
Just use Big Baby.

5174
03:51:06,980 --> 03:51:07,540
Yeah.

5175
03:51:09,220 --> 03:51:10,420
Big Baby time.

5176
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:12,200
Alright.

5177
03:51:12,240 --> 03:51:12,980
Down we go.

5178
03:51:14,320 --> 03:51:14,760
Yeah.

5179
03:51:14,800 --> 03:51:17,740
I didn't realize he was a mini-boss until like I saw the blue.

5180
03:51:18,080 --> 03:51:19,740
The blue is like my yellow paint.

5181
03:51:21,140 --> 03:51:21,580
Oh.

5182
03:51:21,660 --> 03:51:21,680
Wait.

5183
03:51:21,740 --> 03:51:22,320
I forgot the soul.

5184
03:51:23,380 --> 03:51:23,820
See.

5185
03:51:23,940 --> 03:51:25,340
This guy gives me his soul.

5186
03:51:25,920 --> 03:51:27,040
But the other bull.

5187
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:27,280
No.

5188
03:51:27,360 --> 03:51:29,000
He thinks he's just way too special.

5189
03:51:31,600 --> 03:51:32,040
Oh.

5190
03:51:32,080 --> 03:51:32,700
I forgot to heal.

5191
03:51:33,820 --> 03:51:34,260
Guys.

5192
03:51:36,480 --> 03:51:39,180
I just want to make the game like harder.

5193
03:51:39,380 --> 03:51:39,660
Okay.

5194
03:51:39,740 --> 03:51:40,720
I just want to...

5195
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:43,000
The game was just too easy.

5196
03:51:45,860 --> 03:51:48,400
The game was just too easy guys.

5197
03:51:48,600 --> 03:51:48,880
Okay.

5198
03:51:53,660 --> 03:51:54,220
Alright.

5199
03:51:55,160 --> 03:51:55,940
Let's see.

5200
03:51:56,100 --> 03:51:57,080
Down we go.

5201
03:51:58,020 --> 03:52:00,280
This is a big secret area.

5202
03:52:01,020 --> 03:52:01,940
I noticed.

5203
03:52:03,300 --> 03:52:04,420
Just like...

5204
03:52:08,520 --> 03:52:09,080
Oh.

5205
03:52:09,780 --> 03:52:11,180
I could slide down.

5206
03:52:11,360 --> 03:52:11,680
Wait.

5207
03:52:11,780 --> 03:52:12,900
Where should I go?

5208
03:52:13,620 --> 03:52:15,380
Do I go left or right chat?

5209
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:19,020
Left or right?

5210
03:52:21,620 --> 03:52:22,460
Slide down?

5211
03:52:24,060 --> 03:52:24,600
Left?

5212
03:52:24,660 --> 03:52:24,900
Okay.

5213
03:52:25,120 --> 03:52:25,620
Oh.

5214
03:52:26,660 --> 03:52:27,900
It is the same.

5215
03:52:31,920 --> 03:52:32,460
Guys.

5216
03:52:37,220 --> 03:52:38,300
What happened?

5217
03:52:40,520 --> 03:52:41,000
What?

5218
03:52:42,660 --> 03:52:43,140
What?

5219
03:52:44,640 --> 03:52:45,120
Okay.

5220
03:52:45,540 --> 03:52:45,920
I mean.

5221
03:52:46,180 --> 03:52:46,660
What?

5222
03:52:47,620 --> 03:52:49,180
What the fuck just happened?

5223
03:52:50,500 --> 03:52:50,980
Okay.

5224
03:52:52,400 --> 03:52:53,480
Where do I go now?

5225
03:52:54,900 --> 03:52:56,380
I don't know how I got here.

5226
03:52:59,480 --> 03:52:59,960
Okay.

5227
03:53:00,080 --> 03:53:01,100
I guess it's this way.

5228
03:53:01,520 --> 03:53:03,980
I guess it's this way guys.

5229
03:53:08,780 --> 03:53:09,260
Alright.

5230
03:53:09,300 --> 03:53:09,780
Here you go.

5231
03:53:12,500 --> 03:53:13,060
Oh.

5232
03:53:13,320 --> 03:53:13,320
Chest.

5233
03:53:13,740 --> 03:53:14,300
Oh.

5234
03:53:14,900 --> 03:53:15,460
Chest.

5235
03:53:15,460 --> 03:53:16,340
You can fall?

5236
03:53:16,820 --> 03:53:18,780
I thought it was a linear path.

5237
03:53:19,860 --> 03:53:20,420
I thought it was a linear path.

5238
03:53:21,600 --> 03:53:22,800
Is it cold iron leaves?

5239
03:53:22,920 --> 03:53:23,260
I swear.

5240
03:53:23,340 --> 03:53:23,520
Okay.

5241
03:53:23,620 --> 03:53:23,960
Okay.

5242
03:53:24,920 --> 03:53:26,200
I was going to say.

5243
03:53:26,260 --> 03:53:27,020
I swear to god.

5244
03:53:27,080 --> 03:53:29,840
If it's cold iron leaves again.

5245
03:53:30,000 --> 03:53:31,700
I swear to fucking god.

5246
03:53:38,260 --> 03:53:38,820
Alright.

5247
03:53:38,820 --> 03:53:39,960
Down I'll go.

5248
03:53:40,380 --> 03:53:40,480
Alright.

5249
03:53:40,480 --> 03:53:40,480
Down I'll go.

5250
03:53:42,960 --> 03:53:43,220
Yay.

5251
03:53:48,730 --> 03:53:49,090
Vladimir.

5252
03:53:49,090 --> 03:53:50,190
Thank you for the super chat.

5253
03:53:50,270 --> 03:53:50,510
Thank you.

5254
03:53:50,530 --> 03:53:50,790
Thank you.

5255
03:53:50,870 --> 03:53:52,150
Your very first super chat.

5256
03:53:52,910 --> 03:53:53,590
Hey Doki.

5257
03:53:53,650 --> 03:53:55,270
Tomorrow I have an important entrance exam.

5258
03:53:55,490 --> 03:53:56,310
Can you wish me good luck?

5259
03:53:56,370 --> 03:53:56,730
Of course.

5260
03:53:56,750 --> 03:53:57,250
Good luck.

5261
03:53:57,330 --> 03:53:59,450
I wish you good luck in your important entrance exam.

5262
03:53:59,650 --> 03:54:00,850
And that you're going to do great.

5263
03:54:01,590 --> 03:54:02,590
I believe in you.

5264
03:54:04,410 --> 03:54:05,130
Also Syro.

5265
03:54:05,210 --> 03:54:06,690
Thank you for your very first super chat.

5266
03:54:06,770 --> 03:54:07,050
Thank you.

5267
03:54:07,070 --> 03:54:07,810
Thank you.

5268
03:54:08,570 --> 03:54:08,930
Uh.

5269
03:54:09,130 --> 03:54:11,470
If you stand next to a blue wall in the next boss fight.

5270
03:54:11,470 --> 03:54:13,230
You'll find the secret in most people.

5271
03:54:13,310 --> 03:54:13,750
This?

5272
03:54:14,830 --> 03:54:16,070
Or like down there?

5273
03:54:17,910 --> 03:54:18,930
That's an open area.

5274
03:54:19,950 --> 03:54:20,590
Down here?

5275
03:54:23,030 --> 03:54:24,510
Thank you for the super chat.

5276
03:54:24,630 --> 03:54:24,910
Thank you.

5277
03:54:24,970 --> 03:54:25,470
Thank you.

5278
03:54:27,410 --> 03:54:28,630
Oh in the arena.

5279
03:54:28,830 --> 03:54:29,270
Okay.

5280
03:54:29,290 --> 03:54:29,750
Right here.

5281
03:54:32,190 --> 03:54:33,090
Inside the arena.

5282
03:54:33,590 --> 03:54:35,370
I guess the blue wall is that thing.

5283
03:54:35,410 --> 03:54:35,890
Over there.

5284
03:54:46,720 --> 03:54:47,160
Alright.

5285
03:54:47,280 --> 03:54:48,620
What kind of boss are you?

5286
03:54:50,580 --> 03:54:51,740
Uh.

5287
03:54:51,840 --> 03:54:53,260
Bishu GoldenEyed.

5288
03:54:53,380 --> 03:54:54,520
What the fuck?

5289
03:54:54,560 --> 03:54:55,720
Okay.

5290
03:54:56,900 --> 03:54:58,060
That's...

5291
03:54:58,060 --> 03:55:00,560
That's actually cheating.

5292
03:55:02,120 --> 03:55:02,880
That's actually...

5293
03:55:02,880 --> 03:55:06,320
Holy shit.

5294
03:55:06,640 --> 03:55:07,440
That's...

5295
03:55:07,680 --> 03:55:09,260
What the fuck?

5296
03:55:09,420 --> 03:55:11,560
That's actually cheating.

5297
03:55:11,920 --> 03:55:14,620
I was watching a cutscene.

5298
03:55:16,340 --> 03:55:20,000
How the fuck was that lead?

5299
03:55:23,080 --> 03:55:24,920
Oh my god.

5300
03:55:24,940 --> 03:55:26,920
Oh my god.

5301
03:55:27,260 --> 03:55:28,060
Oh my god.

5302
03:55:28,060 --> 03:55:28,760
That should...

5303
03:55:28,760 --> 03:55:30,060
What the fuck?

5304
03:55:30,640 --> 03:55:33,060
That disoriented me.

5305
03:55:33,760 --> 03:55:34,600
That's...

5306
03:55:34,600 --> 03:55:37,600
I'm gonna whip tab.

5307
03:55:37,740 --> 03:55:38,460
I'm fucking whipping.

5308
03:55:38,680 --> 03:55:39,220
I can't.

5309
03:55:39,220 --> 03:55:40,580
I'm gonna start whipping.

5310
03:55:40,880 --> 03:55:42,400
And then I started whipping.

5311
03:55:45,120 --> 03:55:46,660
Jesus Christ.

5312
03:55:48,120 --> 03:55:51,740
Like he literally got a free hit on me.

5313
03:55:51,860 --> 03:55:52,760
Like he literally got a free hit on me.

5314
03:55:52,760 --> 03:55:54,140
Like that shouldn't be legal.

5315
03:55:54,820 --> 03:55:55,300
Like that shouldn't be legal.

5316
03:55:58,280 --> 03:55:59,840
Are you serious?

5317
03:56:00,000 --> 03:56:00,500
Okay.

5318
03:56:00,660 --> 03:56:01,380
That's fine.

5319
03:56:03,820 --> 03:56:05,100
Oh no.

5320
03:56:05,320 --> 03:56:05,480
Oh no.

5321
03:56:07,580 --> 03:56:08,300
Okay.

5322
03:56:08,380 --> 03:56:08,840
That's fine.

5323
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:09,660
Okay.

5324
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:09,660
That's fine.

5325
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:09,920
We're fine.

5326
03:56:10,180 --> 03:56:11,440
We're so fine.

5327
03:56:13,260 --> 03:56:13,980
What?

5328
03:56:13,980 --> 03:56:14,400
What?

5329
03:56:15,420 --> 03:56:15,980
Okay.

5330
03:56:16,080 --> 03:56:16,840
That's okay.

5331
03:56:17,060 --> 03:56:18,540
That is not okay.

5332
03:56:20,540 --> 03:56:21,100
Nevermind.

5333
03:56:22,120 --> 03:56:24,380
It ended up not being okay.

5334
03:56:24,380 --> 03:56:25,020
I guess.

5335
03:56:28,520 --> 03:56:29,080
Okay.

5336
03:56:29,760 --> 03:56:30,540
That's fine.

5337
03:56:30,940 --> 03:56:33,220
Guys, I think he's gonna break the street, guys.

5338
03:56:33,340 --> 03:56:33,680
Like...

5339
03:56:34,940 --> 03:56:36,340
Guys, look at him.

5340
03:56:37,660 --> 03:56:39,500
Guys, like I don't know.

5341
03:56:39,760 --> 03:56:41,160
Guys, look at him.

5342
03:56:43,300 --> 03:56:45,060
Like it's very understandable.

5343
03:56:47,300 --> 03:56:48,700
Like it's very understandable.

5344
03:56:49,960 --> 03:56:50,420
Okay.

5345
03:56:53,680 --> 03:56:54,140
Okay.

5346
03:56:54,200 --> 03:56:54,600
There you go.

5347
03:56:54,620 --> 03:56:54,820
It's fine.

5348
03:56:57,400 --> 03:56:58,160
Oh God.

5349
03:56:58,420 --> 03:56:59,520
Oh fuck!

5350
03:57:00,780 --> 03:57:01,700
Oh please!

5351
03:57:03,860 --> 03:57:04,320
Okay.

5352
03:57:04,360 --> 03:57:04,720
That's fine.

5353
03:57:04,780 --> 03:57:05,120
We're fine.

5354
03:57:05,180 --> 03:57:05,540
We're fine.

5355
03:57:07,840 --> 03:57:08,620
We're fine.

5356
03:57:08,620 --> 03:57:09,320
We're so fine.

5357
03:57:10,640 --> 03:57:12,380
I'm just gonna hit this now.

5358
03:57:12,520 --> 03:57:13,500
Like I can't.

5359
03:57:13,800 --> 03:57:15,400
I can't.

5360
03:57:19,540 --> 03:57:20,080
Okay.

5361
03:57:20,220 --> 03:57:20,500
Alright.

5362
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:20,840
Here we go.

5363
03:57:22,540 --> 03:57:23,080
Whoa!

5364
03:57:24,080 --> 03:57:24,620
Whoa!

5365
03:57:26,420 --> 03:57:27,100
We're okay.

5366
03:57:29,320 --> 03:57:30,400
Jesus Christ!

5367
03:57:32,360 --> 03:57:33,660
Oh my God!

5368
03:57:34,240 --> 03:57:34,780
Hahaha!

5369
03:57:36,640 --> 03:57:38,480
Guys, I don't think he likes me.

5370
03:57:38,620 --> 03:57:39,400
Hahaha!

5371
03:57:41,480 --> 03:57:43,800
I don't think he likes me, guys.

5372
03:57:44,020 --> 03:57:45,840
I don't think he likes me, guys.

5373
03:57:45,840 --> 03:57:47,860
I don't know what I did to him!

5374
03:57:48,640 --> 03:57:49,160
Whoa!

5375
03:57:53,230 --> 03:57:53,750
Okay.

5376
03:57:53,890 --> 03:57:54,370
We're fine.

5377
03:57:55,830 --> 03:57:58,870
I mean we're not, but like I'm just trying to lie to myself until I...

5378
03:57:58,870 --> 03:57:59,630
Hahaha!

5379
03:58:02,150 --> 03:58:03,650
Oh my God!

5380
03:58:03,870 --> 03:58:05,910
I'm just lying to myself right now.

5381
03:58:06,310 --> 03:58:06,830
I'm just lying to myself right now.

5382
03:58:09,390 --> 03:58:09,910
Okay.

5383
03:58:10,030 --> 03:58:10,330
Heal.

5384
03:58:11,190 --> 03:58:11,790
Okay.

5385
03:58:15,290 --> 03:58:15,890
pleasures!

5386
03:58:17,390 --> 03:58:17,990
Whip!

5387
03:58:19,130 --> 03:58:19,730
Whip!

5388
03:58:19,730 --> 03:58:20,330
Whip!

5389
03:58:20,690 --> 03:58:22,630
Whip!esser!

5390
03:58:23,470 --> 03:58:24,810
affectionate Golden beast!

5391
03:58:26,070 --> 03:58:26,670
Bad!

5392
03:58:26,870 --> 03:58:27,590
You've been bad!

5393
03:58:27,690 --> 03:58:28,650
You've been so bad!

5394
03:58:29,210 --> 03:58:29,810
Hahaha!

5395
03:58:34,910 --> 03:58:36,790
I'm just gonna use the regular attack.

5396
03:58:36,790 --> 03:58:39,890
Like, I don't think I can charge it in time, I don't think.

5397
03:58:41,070 --> 03:58:42,770
That's right, but whip your ass!

5398
03:58:43,110 --> 03:58:44,050
But whip it!

5399
03:58:44,270 --> 03:58:45,330
Whip it real good!

5400
03:58:49,690 --> 03:58:50,170
Alright.

5401
03:58:51,610 --> 03:58:52,930
That's the best I could do.

5402
03:58:53,390 --> 03:58:56,930
In this scenario I was put in.

5403
03:58:59,290 --> 03:58:59,770
Okay.

5404
03:59:01,610 --> 03:59:02,990
Jesus Christ, okay.

5405
03:59:04,610 --> 03:59:05,490
Okay, there we go.

5406
03:59:09,490 --> 03:59:11,210
Jesus Christ, okay.

5407
03:59:13,670 --> 03:59:14,950
Fucking backflip!

5408
03:59:14,970 --> 03:59:17,210
Like, who are you trying to fucking impress?

5409
03:59:17,570 --> 03:59:19,150
Like, clearly not me!

5410
03:59:20,890 --> 03:59:23,830
The fucking backflip too.

5411
03:59:24,650 --> 03:59:25,290
Jesus!

5412
03:59:31,620 --> 03:59:32,260
Okay.

5413
03:59:34,800 --> 03:59:36,060
Oh my god.

5414
03:59:36,600 --> 03:59:37,880
Oh my god.

5415
03:59:38,620 --> 03:59:39,260
Keep!

5416
03:59:39,880 --> 03:59:40,280
Keep!

5417
03:59:40,320 --> 03:59:40,800
Keep!

5418
03:59:43,100 --> 03:59:44,000
Oh no.

5419
03:59:45,040 --> 03:59:45,980
Oh no!

5420
03:59:48,160 --> 03:59:48,720
Okay.

5421
03:59:50,740 --> 03:59:51,560
Magic cape.

5422
03:59:51,720 --> 03:59:52,560
Oh shit!

5423
03:59:52,660 --> 03:59:52,960
Okay.

5424
03:59:54,740 --> 03:59:55,980
Please tell me I can hit this.

5425
03:59:56,080 --> 03:59:56,200
Okay.

5426
03:59:56,280 --> 03:59:56,860
Thank god.

5427
03:59:57,300 --> 03:59:57,860
That's it.

5428
03:59:58,480 --> 03:59:59,040
No!

5429
04:00:03,930 --> 04:00:04,750
I missed that!

5430
04:00:08,820 --> 04:00:10,340
That should be legal!

5431
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:16,080
Oh my god, so sad.

5432
04:00:16,280 --> 04:00:18,120
I'm so sad!

5433
04:00:21,480 --> 04:00:22,440
Yes!

5434
04:00:22,700 --> 04:00:23,500
First try!

5435
04:00:35,530 --> 04:00:36,970
Thank god!

5436
04:00:38,550 --> 04:00:40,510
There's a fucking baby?!

5437
04:01:02,010 --> 04:01:04,350
There's a secret treasure that I can't get!

5438
04:01:17,030 --> 04:01:17,790
That's her!

5439
04:01:18,310 --> 04:01:19,210
Wait, he found her?

5440
04:01:41,050 --> 04:01:44,670
I didn't realize I can't go back to the wall!

5441
04:01:47,090 --> 04:01:48,310
Oh, this is the past.

5442
04:01:48,550 --> 04:01:48,770
Okay.

5443
04:01:51,230 --> 04:01:53,650
Oh, this is an affair child!

5444
04:02:02,570 --> 04:02:10,910
Why are you red?

5445
04:02:19,340 --> 04:02:20,320
That's a raver?

5446
04:02:20,440 --> 04:02:21,380
He's adopted?

5447
04:02:21,800 --> 04:02:23,560
Oh, he's not even an affair child!

5448
04:02:25,440 --> 04:02:26,960
He was just...

5449
04:02:30,160 --> 04:02:31,980
Because he's angry.

5450
04:02:34,240 --> 04:02:36,000
The fuck was I supposed to do?

5451
04:02:36,020 --> 04:02:36,820
It was gonna kick me out!

5452
04:02:39,940 --> 04:02:43,540
I can't believe he kicked me out!

5453
04:02:44,840 --> 04:02:48,640
I can't believe I had to go back!

5454
04:02:49,980 --> 04:02:50,960
This is...

5455
04:02:50,960 --> 04:02:51,960
This should be illegal.

5456
04:02:54,520 --> 04:02:55,760
It should be illegal.

5457
04:02:56,180 --> 04:02:58,080
I can't believe it kicked me out.

5458
04:02:59,960 --> 04:03:01,020
I didn't know!

5459
04:03:01,740 --> 04:03:03,940
People were just like, we're gonna go there!

5460
04:03:04,340 --> 04:03:06,220
And I was like, okay, I'll go there after I kill him.

5461
04:03:10,020 --> 04:03:11,380
Oh, I can craft new armor now?

5462
04:03:11,540 --> 04:03:11,900
Nice.

5463
04:03:12,320 --> 04:03:12,760
Alright.

5464
04:03:13,060 --> 04:03:14,320
Oh, and I can craft a new weapon!

5465
04:03:16,240 --> 04:03:16,980
Is this?

5466
04:03:18,520 --> 04:03:19,420
Oh, it's weaker.

5467
04:03:20,140 --> 04:03:20,620
Yeah.

5468
04:03:20,620 --> 04:03:24,900
Oh, but it does have critical hit chance up by 10%.

5469
04:03:24,900 --> 04:03:26,120
Is it worth it, guys?

5470
04:03:27,700 --> 04:03:29,040
Guys, is it worth it?

5471
04:03:29,540 --> 04:03:31,180
To get the beast staff?

5472
04:03:32,480 --> 04:03:34,580
I mean, the critical chance is nice, yeah.

5473
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:35,480
I'll get that.

5474
04:03:36,720 --> 04:03:37,160
No?

5475
04:03:37,980 --> 04:03:38,600
It's not?

5476
04:03:49,100 --> 04:03:50,760
From the River of Childbearing.

5477
04:03:50,840 --> 04:03:53,000
Bai Jingtang Monk actually drank from a two-in-a-street.

5478
04:03:53,100 --> 04:03:54,920
Luckily, they got the mat- What the fuck?

5479
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:56,420
Envy, thank you for the super chat.

5480
04:03:56,480 --> 04:03:57,340
Thank you, thank you.

5481
04:03:57,880 --> 04:03:59,260
From the River of Childbearing.

5482
04:04:00,420 --> 04:04:02,200
The pillar buff is better?

5483
04:04:02,460 --> 04:04:04,560
Yeah, I think the pillar buff is better though.

5484
04:04:04,660 --> 04:04:05,080
You're right.

5485
04:04:05,640 --> 04:04:07,660
I think it is a lot better.

5486
04:04:07,820 --> 04:04:08,520
Oh, shit.

5487
04:04:08,640 --> 04:04:09,480
What the fuck?

5488
04:04:10,400 --> 04:04:10,920
80?

5489
04:04:12,040 --> 04:04:13,080
Holy shit.

5490
04:04:13,880 --> 04:04:14,720
Yes, please.

5491
04:04:17,160 --> 04:04:18,540
Oh my god.

5492
04:04:21,120 --> 04:04:23,140
This is like, so much stronger.

5493
04:04:25,260 --> 04:04:26,120
Wait, I'm poor.

5494
04:04:28,640 --> 04:04:30,800
Wait, the Bull King's Iron Horn?

5495
04:04:31,560 --> 04:04:32,360
Wait a minute.

5496
04:04:36,390 --> 04:04:38,150
I thought you read- I did read the novel.

5497
04:04:38,350 --> 04:04:39,390
It's just been a long time.

5498
04:04:39,610 --> 04:04:42,410
I read the Three Kingdoms, but I don't remember- I don't remember everything.

5499
04:04:43,590 --> 04:04:47,650
It's still one of my favorite stories, but I don't remember all the details of it.

5500
04:04:52,780 --> 04:04:53,220
What?

5501
04:04:53,720 --> 04:04:57,200
I- I thought I had enough.

5502
04:05:01,390 --> 04:05:01,830
No.

5503
04:05:09,310 --> 04:05:14,210
I didn't- I didn't realize I didn't have enough.

5504
04:05:20,110 --> 04:05:20,770
Noooo!

5505
04:05:25,970 --> 04:05:28,550
I was like, yaaaay!

5506
04:05:28,850 --> 04:05:31,130
I got that, and then I was like, wait a minute.

5507
04:05:33,010 --> 04:05:33,670
No...

5508
04:05:33,670 --> 04:05:34,910
Oh my god.

5509
04:05:35,570 --> 04:05:38,450
I just saw a big number.

5510
04:05:38,990 --> 04:05:40,990
I just saw a big number.

5511
04:05:48,680 --> 04:05:50,600
Okay, time to do this again.

5512
04:05:51,300 --> 04:05:53,340
Apparently there's another boss after this.

5513
04:05:54,420 --> 04:05:56,100
Apparently I need to fight another one.

5514
04:05:56,560 --> 04:05:57,960
Can I just run through it?

5515
04:06:00,160 --> 04:06:01,340
Oh no, there isn't.

5516
04:06:01,900 --> 04:06:03,240
Oh, sweet.

5517
04:06:06,380 --> 04:06:06,900
No new boss.

5518
04:06:07,000 --> 04:06:08,100
I was baited again.

5519
04:06:09,780 --> 04:06:11,100
Oh, thank god.

5520
04:06:11,400 --> 04:06:11,760
Yay!

5521
04:06:12,580 --> 04:06:13,100
Items!

5522
04:06:23,620 --> 04:06:24,140
Okay.

5523
04:06:24,140 --> 04:06:25,680
Nice, I got the wine worm.

5524
04:06:35,550 --> 04:06:38,070
If you did it during the fight...

5525
04:06:39,570 --> 04:06:41,050
Now it's just for loot?

5526
04:06:41,170 --> 04:06:41,690
Nice.

5527
04:06:42,750 --> 04:06:43,870
That's my favorite.

5528
04:06:44,330 --> 04:06:45,330
Where am I?

5529
04:06:47,670 --> 04:06:49,090
Is this just all loot?

5530
04:06:51,790 --> 04:06:52,970
Did I go backwards?

5531
04:06:53,210 --> 04:06:54,390
Where is this place?

5532
04:07:00,960 --> 04:07:02,260
This seems like a boss.

5533
04:07:04,080 --> 04:07:05,440
Oh, this is...

5534
04:07:07,740 --> 04:07:08,700
What the fuck?

5535
04:07:10,660 --> 04:07:11,940
The fuck is... What?

5536
04:07:12,060 --> 04:07:13,060
Is this the new boss?

5537
04:07:20,130 --> 04:07:22,890
This was if you got him to do the secret?

5538
04:07:23,090 --> 04:07:23,330
Oh!

5539
04:07:26,470 --> 04:07:28,070
I killed him early.

5540
04:07:28,150 --> 04:07:29,030
I'm just that good.

5541
04:07:31,630 --> 04:07:34,230
Like, do I get any... If I did...

5542
04:07:35,770 --> 04:07:38,810
Like, is it... Would it... Would I get anything special?

5543
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:47,980
Nothing extra?

5544
04:07:48,120 --> 04:07:48,740
Oh, thank god.

5545
04:07:48,800 --> 04:07:49,540
Okay, that's great.

5546
04:07:50,040 --> 04:07:52,220
Literally doesn't get anything out of it.

5547
04:07:56,560 --> 04:07:57,120
Nice.

5548
04:07:57,140 --> 04:07:59,180
Oh, this is where he turns into fire.

5549
04:08:00,120 --> 04:08:01,340
Back to fire.

5550
04:08:01,540 --> 04:08:03,400
Fucking weak-ass monster.

5551
04:08:07,820 --> 04:08:10,300
Fucking shitty-ass monster, I guess.

5552
04:08:11,220 --> 04:08:12,820
Just a quip.

5553
04:08:15,800 --> 04:08:16,660
That's right.

5554
04:08:17,620 --> 04:08:19,200
So fucking easy.

5555
04:08:22,080 --> 04:08:22,720
Alright.

5556
04:08:23,680 --> 04:08:26,720
He trying to earn money.

5557
04:08:31,630 --> 04:08:33,030
That's too locked in.

5558
04:08:33,170 --> 04:08:34,510
Alright, do I TP back out?

5559
04:08:35,310 --> 04:08:35,950
Now?

5560
04:08:39,870 --> 04:08:43,030
Do I just TP back out?

5561
04:08:43,090 --> 04:08:43,310
Okay.

5562
04:08:43,990 --> 04:08:44,170
Alright.

5563
04:08:45,390 --> 04:08:45,890
Nice.

5564
04:08:48,930 --> 04:08:49,430
Nice.

5565
04:08:50,830 --> 04:08:51,330
Okay.

5566
04:08:51,990 --> 04:08:53,890
I guess I go...

5567
04:08:55,030 --> 04:08:56,970
I guess I go back to the bull area.

5568
04:08:57,170 --> 04:08:57,850
Back to the bull.

5569
04:08:58,110 --> 04:09:00,030
Back to the nicely placed rock.

5570
04:09:01,630 --> 04:09:03,890
Jenny, welcome to the tomato farm.

5571
04:09:03,970 --> 04:09:04,610
Welcome, welcome.

5572
04:09:05,170 --> 04:09:06,510
I think it's like here, right?

5573
04:09:06,970 --> 04:09:07,710
There we go.

5574
04:09:10,270 --> 04:09:11,410
Time for the bull.

5575
04:09:11,810 --> 04:09:12,930
I'll do the...

5576
04:09:15,570 --> 04:09:18,670
I'll do the final chapter 5 boss and then I'll do chapter 3.

5577
04:09:18,770 --> 04:09:19,150
Secret.

5578
04:09:19,850 --> 04:09:21,470
I'll finish this chapter first.

5579
04:09:26,790 --> 04:09:29,050
Chapter 3 zone will take you 5 hours?

5580
04:09:29,310 --> 04:09:32,090
Okay, we're gonna do this and do chapter 3 another day.

5581
04:09:32,290 --> 04:09:32,990
We're gonna...

5582
04:09:34,790 --> 04:09:38,590
We're gonna do chapter 3 another day, guys.

5583
04:09:46,930 --> 04:09:48,290
Oh hey, there she is.

5584
04:09:48,590 --> 04:09:48,790
Father!

5585
04:09:48,910 --> 04:09:49,310
Father!

5586
04:09:49,570 --> 04:09:50,330
I brought the heavenly person.

5587
04:09:50,330 --> 04:09:54,290
As long as brother isn't here, father can return the thing to her.

5588
04:09:55,150 --> 04:09:58,330
Once this thing returns to source, the brother will naturally shatter his mind.

5589
04:09:58,430 --> 04:10:00,370
The end of Flame Mountain will be understood.

5590
04:10:02,970 --> 04:10:03,610
Let's hope.

5591
04:10:13,630 --> 04:10:14,110
Wait...

5592
04:10:14,850 --> 04:10:16,550
How did you and the wife...

5593
04:10:16,550 --> 04:10:17,450
Whoa.

5594
04:10:18,850 --> 04:10:19,330
Freaky.

5595
04:10:19,410 --> 04:10:19,790
Freaky.

5596
04:10:22,510 --> 04:10:24,110
No, it's covered up by the fur.

5597
04:10:34,660 --> 04:10:36,040
Oh yeah, you can change the size!

5598
04:10:36,260 --> 04:10:36,400
Yeah!

5599
04:10:36,900 --> 04:10:38,340
A lot of them can, I forgot.

5600
04:10:39,260 --> 04:10:40,600
They can change their sizes.

5601
04:10:46,780 --> 04:10:47,180
Woah!

5602
04:10:54,200 --> 04:10:54,760
Woah!

5603
04:10:54,760 --> 04:10:54,760
Is

5604
04:11:01,120 --> 04:11:03,840
he gonna die now, after seeing that?

5605
04:11:11,760 --> 04:11:12,760
After... what?

5606
04:11:19,100 --> 04:11:20,360
Foxes always lie!

5607
04:11:24,360 --> 04:11:25,900
Oh my god, is it the brother?

5608
04:11:27,700 --> 04:11:29,360
It's the brother, isn't it?

5609
04:11:32,300 --> 04:11:34,160
What the fuck is this?

5610
04:11:43,320 --> 04:11:45,280
What happened to the...

5611
04:11:46,820 --> 04:11:49,260
Wait, what happened to the fox lady?

5612
04:11:51,200 --> 04:11:52,780
It was never real?

5613
04:12:33,500 --> 04:12:34,700
Oh no...

5614
04:12:34,700 --> 04:12:35,620
Oh no!

5615
04:12:35,620 --> 04:12:36,560
I can't believe it!

5616
04:12:36,700 --> 04:12:38,400
I fell in love with him?!

5617
04:12:49,240 --> 04:12:51,820
I can't believe it!

5618
04:12:51,820 --> 04:12:57,740
I thought we were going to get married if we were going to do your dad's hair like this!

5619
04:12:58,420 --> 04:13:00,220
I'm so messed up!

5620
04:13:03,780 --> 04:13:06,660
Do you even love me?

5621
04:13:08,040 --> 04:13:09,260
I'm so sad!

5622
04:13:12,420 --> 04:13:14,580
Oh my god, she could do that too?

5623
04:13:17,040 --> 04:13:18,260
Wait, that's cheating!

5624
04:13:19,940 --> 04:13:22,000
I thought only I could do that.

5625
04:13:23,160 --> 04:13:24,160
Oh my god.

5626
04:13:25,520 --> 04:13:26,340
Oh shit.

5627
04:13:27,560 --> 04:13:30,100
Oh my god, I'm getting hit by all of them because I can't see.

5628
04:13:30,380 --> 04:13:32,040
Oh my god, fuck this.

5629
04:13:32,140 --> 04:13:33,060
I'm not even gonna...

5630
04:13:33,060 --> 04:13:34,580
I'm fucking...

5631
04:13:35,120 --> 04:13:36,520
Oh my god.

5632
04:13:36,660 --> 04:13:38,380
This is actually... I'm just...

5633
04:13:38,380 --> 04:13:39,480
I'm fucking using cloud step.

5634
04:13:39,560 --> 04:13:40,360
This is actually bullshit.

5635
04:13:40,640 --> 04:13:41,100
Like...

5636
04:13:42,920 --> 04:13:47,080
That was such a bullshit fucking ability.

5637
04:13:47,180 --> 04:13:48,160
I couldn't.

5638
04:13:48,700 --> 04:13:50,840
I was like, bro, fuck this.

5639
04:13:54,240 --> 04:13:56,400
I can't believe it was a lie!

5640
04:13:56,580 --> 04:13:57,140
Get whipped!

5641
04:13:57,400 --> 04:13:58,280
Get whipped!

5642
04:13:59,460 --> 04:14:01,780
I'm gonna whip my heart out!

5643
04:14:02,420 --> 04:14:04,480
Fix my broken heart!

5644
04:14:06,060 --> 04:14:09,400
I'll whip until my heart is fixed!

5645
04:14:09,700 --> 04:14:13,120
I'll whip until my heart is fixed!

5646
04:14:13,300 --> 04:14:14,720
I'll whip until my heart is fixed!

5647
04:14:14,720 --> 04:14:15,020
Whip!

5648
04:14:15,020 --> 04:14:15,940
Get whipped!

5649
04:14:16,100 --> 04:14:16,780
Get whipped!

5650
04:14:17,400 --> 04:14:18,780
I'm so sad!

5651
04:14:19,200 --> 04:14:21,180
I lost the love of my life!

5652
04:14:21,220 --> 04:14:22,320
It was all fake!

5653
04:14:22,660 --> 04:14:24,540
It was all fake!

5654
04:14:27,240 --> 04:14:30,300
I thought it would fit something.

5655
04:14:31,060 --> 04:14:34,020
I thought it would fit something.

5656
04:14:34,020 --> 04:14:34,140
Fuck!

5657
04:14:35,340 --> 04:14:36,700
Oh shit!

5658
04:14:39,680 --> 04:14:42,720
I thought I meant something to you!

5659
04:14:48,580 --> 04:14:51,460
Did I not mean anything to you?

5660
04:14:52,340 --> 04:14:53,460
Oh, it's second phase.

5661
04:14:53,600 --> 04:14:55,200
I can tell because there's no name.

5662
04:14:55,420 --> 04:14:56,500
There's no name.

5663
04:14:56,740 --> 04:14:59,020
I can tell there's a second phase.

5664
04:15:00,920 --> 04:15:01,600
...

5665
04:15:04,980 --> 04:15:05,320
...

5666
04:15:06,460 --> 04:15:07,260
...

5667
04:15:12,360 --> 04:15:13,160
...

5668
04:15:13,160 --> 04:15:13,760
...

5669
04:15:14,780 --> 04:15:16,960
I ruined the family?!

5670
04:15:16,960 --> 04:15:18,980
What the fuck do you mean?!

5671
04:15:18,980 --> 04:15:22,020
What did I do?!

5672
04:15:23,400 --> 04:15:25,940
Your son was a bad person!

5673
04:15:26,280 --> 04:15:26,360
...

5674
04:15:28,460 --> 04:15:30,540
How did I become the homewrecker?

5675
04:15:30,960 --> 04:15:31,620
...

5676
04:15:31,620 --> 04:15:32,560
...

5677
04:15:33,760 --> 04:15:36,940
Your family was already messed up when you got here!

5678
04:15:37,840 --> 04:15:37,940
...

5679
04:15:45,210 --> 04:15:46,230
What the fuck?

5680
04:15:46,310 --> 04:15:47,690
Oh, there's my artifact!

5681
04:15:48,670 --> 04:15:48,830
...

5682
04:15:49,630 --> 04:15:51,050
You swallowed it?

5683
04:15:52,390 --> 04:15:52,710
...

5684
04:15:52,710 --> 04:15:52,790
...

5685
04:15:55,020 --> 04:15:56,100
...

5686
04:15:58,920 --> 04:15:59,560
...

5687
04:15:59,560 --> 04:15:59,680
...

5688
04:16:04,200 --> 04:16:05,740
Yeah, but like...

5689
04:16:06,640 --> 04:16:08,400
She was a bad mom!

5690
04:16:10,440 --> 04:16:11,040
...

5691
04:16:11,040 --> 04:16:12,000
That wasn't even me!

5692
04:16:12,080 --> 04:16:13,400
That was the Chupacay!

5693
04:16:13,580 --> 04:16:15,000
Chupacay did it, not me!

5694
04:16:15,540 --> 04:16:16,860
I just was there.

5695
04:16:17,480 --> 04:16:18,080
...

5696
04:16:21,440 --> 04:16:23,460
The philosopher's kidney stone.

5697
04:16:24,520 --> 04:16:25,120
...

5698
04:16:27,660 --> 04:16:29,220
He just chose to run.

5699
04:16:30,260 --> 04:16:30,860
...

5700
04:16:30,860 --> 04:16:31,900
...

5701
04:16:31,900 --> 04:16:31,980
...

5702
04:16:38,210 --> 04:16:40,050
Oh, he's gonna take it.

5703
04:16:40,350 --> 04:16:41,530
...

5704
04:16:45,370 --> 04:16:46,910
He's gonna yoink it.

5705
04:16:47,730 --> 04:16:48,230
...

5706
04:16:48,230 --> 04:16:49,410
...

5707
04:16:51,110 --> 04:16:51,810
...

5708
04:16:53,310 --> 04:16:54,010
...

5709
04:16:54,010 --> 04:16:54,170
...

5710
04:16:54,170 --> 04:16:56,190
...

5711
04:16:56,190 --> 04:16:57,230
...

5712
04:17:13,750 --> 04:17:14,650
Oh, shit!

5713
04:17:15,270 --> 04:17:16,470
Oh, he's not dead.

5714
04:17:17,830 --> 04:17:17,890
...

5715
04:17:18,870 --> 04:17:20,470
He faked his death.

5716
04:17:20,770 --> 04:17:21,090
...

5717
04:17:21,090 --> 04:17:22,210
...

5718
04:17:23,070 --> 04:17:23,670
...

5719
04:17:25,050 --> 04:17:25,650
...

5720
04:17:28,030 --> 04:17:29,930
Oh my god, he faked his death!

5721
04:17:30,310 --> 04:17:31,990
What the fuck is this Telenova?

5722
04:17:32,370 --> 04:17:32,970
...

5723
04:17:37,170 --> 04:17:38,890
Is he gonna eat it?

5724
04:17:39,550 --> 04:17:40,850
Oh my god!

5725
04:17:41,210 --> 04:17:41,550
...

5726
04:17:44,910 --> 04:17:46,630
How did it fit in that mouth?

5727
04:17:46,730 --> 04:17:47,150
...

5728
04:17:58,580 --> 04:18:00,620
I think it needs to go to angry management.

5729
04:18:02,100 --> 04:18:02,580
...

5730
04:18:02,580 --> 04:18:03,240
Chupacay?

5731
04:18:04,140 --> 04:18:05,240
Oh my god, you're alive!

5732
04:18:06,320 --> 04:18:08,660
Bro, I told you I'd never choose her over you.

5733
04:18:08,760 --> 04:18:11,120
Because, you know, she wasn't even real in the end.

5734
04:18:11,880 --> 04:18:12,360
...

5735
04:18:12,360 --> 04:18:14,520
Oh my god, he's big now.

5736
04:18:15,000 --> 04:18:15,480
...

5737
04:18:15,480 --> 04:18:17,680
Oh, god!

5738
04:18:18,600 --> 04:18:19,080
...

5739
04:18:21,860 --> 04:18:22,340
See?

5740
04:18:22,560 --> 04:18:24,140
I didn't choose her over you.

5741
04:18:24,260 --> 04:18:25,380
Because she was never real.

5742
04:18:26,640 --> 04:18:27,120
...

5743
04:18:34,160 --> 04:18:34,880
Wait, what?

5744
04:18:37,380 --> 04:18:37,900
...

5745
04:18:37,900 --> 04:18:38,900
...

5746
04:18:48,220 --> 04:18:48,740
...

5747
04:18:48,740 --> 04:18:48,780
...

5748
04:18:48,780 --> 04:18:49,480
...

5749
04:18:49,480 --> 04:18:53,220
I don't think he likes him, because didn't he kill his wife?

5750
04:18:53,360 --> 04:18:53,660
...

5751
04:18:54,540 --> 04:18:55,660
Oh shit, nice!

5752
04:18:55,740 --> 04:18:56,680
Pixie's here too.

5753
04:18:56,960 --> 04:18:57,200
...

5754
04:18:58,020 --> 04:18:58,700
Don't worry.

5755
04:18:59,100 --> 04:19:00,120
I've got the hair.

5756
04:19:00,800 --> 04:19:01,320
...

5757
04:19:01,320 --> 04:19:01,520
That's fine.

5758
04:19:01,600 --> 04:19:02,500
Round 3.

5759
04:19:02,980 --> 04:19:04,400
Sorry, I can't count.

5760
04:19:04,600 --> 04:19:05,280
I don't know why I lost.

5761
04:19:05,480 --> 04:19:07,160
I don't know how I lost count there.

5762
04:19:07,560 --> 04:19:08,000
...

5763
04:19:08,000 --> 04:19:08,520
...

5764
04:19:11,440 --> 04:19:12,320
Oh shit!

5765
04:19:12,500 --> 04:19:13,500
Okay, that's fine.

5766
04:19:13,720 --> 04:19:13,880
...

5767
04:19:13,880 --> 04:19:15,280
That is not fine.

5768
04:19:15,540 --> 04:19:16,560
Okay, we're gonna...

5769
04:19:16,560 --> 04:19:18,000
... heal here.

5770
04:19:18,300 --> 04:19:20,480
I don't know how I messed up one number.

5771
04:19:20,680 --> 04:19:21,120
...

5772
04:19:23,540 --> 04:19:25,220
Alright, poor Sab...

5773
04:19:25,220 --> 04:19:25,720
...

5774
04:19:26,200 --> 04:19:26,640
...

5775
04:19:26,640 --> 04:19:26,960
Get whipped.

5776
04:19:27,060 --> 04:19:27,720
Get whipped.

5777
04:19:27,800 --> 04:19:28,480
Get whipped.

5778
04:19:28,800 --> 04:19:29,600
Get whipped.

5779
04:19:30,220 --> 04:19:31,320
That's fucking right.

5780
04:19:31,980 --> 04:19:33,760
You missed your appointment, child.

5781
04:19:34,100 --> 04:19:34,860
Get whipped.

5782
04:19:35,020 --> 04:19:35,520
Get whipped.

5783
04:19:35,720 --> 04:19:36,380
Get whipped.

5784
04:19:37,560 --> 04:19:39,020
That's fucking right.

5785
04:19:40,920 --> 04:19:42,440
I'm gonna rip you real good.

5786
04:19:43,700 --> 04:19:45,860
You think you can get away from me?

5787
04:19:46,020 --> 04:19:47,320
That's fucking right.

5788
04:19:47,900 --> 04:19:49,240
I can take this.

5789
04:19:49,940 --> 04:19:52,240
Oh, I don't think I can take this.

5790
04:19:52,700 --> 04:19:55,280
Yes, I don't think I can take this.

5791
04:19:55,280 --> 04:19:57,220
Holy shit!

5792
04:20:00,880 --> 04:20:03,880
Oh my god, where did Pixie go?

5793
04:20:07,800 --> 04:20:09,820
Did he like leave me?

5794
04:20:10,620 --> 04:20:15,580
Where did he go?

5795
04:20:28,020 --> 04:20:30,000
He's right on my face.

5796
04:20:30,280 --> 04:20:32,140
Chewbacca, help me!

5797
04:20:32,920 --> 04:20:34,600
Help me!

5798
04:20:43,760 --> 04:20:44,720
Chewbacca...

5799
04:20:44,720 --> 04:20:46,440
He just rejected.

5800
04:20:48,680 --> 04:20:50,240
He just rejected.

5801
04:20:50,360 --> 04:20:51,680
He just rejected.

5802
04:20:52,320 --> 04:20:56,100
Bro, he like actually left me!

5803
04:20:56,220 --> 04:20:58,140
That's so fucked!

5804
04:20:58,460 --> 04:21:00,780
Oh my god!

5805
04:21:01,080 --> 04:21:01,300
Oh my god!

5806
04:21:01,300 --> 04:21:02,840
Where did he go?

5807
04:21:03,260 --> 04:21:04,620
Where did he go?

5808
04:21:07,530 --> 04:21:08,010
Okay.

5809
04:21:08,010 --> 04:21:08,210
Okay.

5810
04:21:10,390 --> 04:21:12,490
Okay, I gotta fucking run.

5811
04:21:14,510 --> 04:21:16,970
Okay, this music is badass though, not gonna lie.

5812
04:21:19,550 --> 04:21:20,550
Holy fuck!

5813
04:21:20,930 --> 04:21:23,550
Oh, shit!

5814
04:21:24,030 --> 04:21:25,150
Oh god, okay.

5815
04:21:26,730 --> 04:21:28,950
Oh my god, I don't know his moves.

5816
04:21:29,050 --> 04:21:30,410
His moves are so weird.

5817
04:21:31,110 --> 04:21:32,290
Like, in general.

5818
04:21:35,810 --> 04:21:36,810
Oh my god.

5819
04:21:38,230 --> 04:21:39,110
Oh fuck!

5820
04:21:44,140 --> 04:21:46,100
Okay, I just need the fire thing.

5821
04:21:46,220 --> 04:21:49,440
I don't know if the fire thing would be helpful, but like, I...

5822
04:21:49,960 --> 04:21:52,020
I need everything I could get right now.

5823
04:21:55,280 --> 04:21:56,920
Oh, god damn!

5824
04:22:00,280 --> 04:22:00,720
Okay.

5825
04:22:05,540 --> 04:22:06,360
Okay, there's five.

5826
04:22:07,360 --> 04:22:08,520
Okay, I need to...

5827
04:22:08,520 --> 04:22:11,600
What the fuck is he doing?

5828
04:22:12,040 --> 04:22:12,940
I can't see!

5829
04:22:14,200 --> 04:22:16,340
He's waving his fucking sword!

5830
04:22:18,500 --> 04:22:19,180
Yes!

5831
04:22:19,520 --> 04:22:20,620
First try!

5832
04:22:21,500 --> 04:22:23,540
Today is first try day!

5833
04:22:29,580 --> 04:22:31,480
And he came back!

5834
04:22:31,640 --> 04:22:32,660
Fucking bitch!

5835
04:22:32,680 --> 04:22:33,200
You whore!

5836
04:22:35,780 --> 04:22:37,020
This was my kill!

5837
04:22:37,060 --> 04:22:37,920
You can't take credit!

5838
04:22:38,480 --> 04:22:40,500
You can't take credit on this!

5839
04:22:40,500 --> 04:22:42,760
This was literally my kill!

5840
04:22:47,920 --> 04:22:49,040
Oh, shit!

5841
04:22:52,320 --> 04:22:53,700
Oh, she's here!

5842
04:22:54,780 --> 04:22:55,400
Come on!

5843
04:22:56,620 --> 04:22:57,600
Honestly, I would...

5844
04:22:57,600 --> 04:23:00,080
I would do the Chapter 3 secret boss just before...

5845
04:23:00,080 --> 04:23:00,340
Yeah!

5846
04:23:00,780 --> 04:23:01,620
Yeah, I will.

5847
04:23:01,780 --> 04:23:04,420
It's just that apparently it's gonna take a long time.

5848
04:23:07,120 --> 04:23:08,400
Thank you for the super chat.

5849
04:23:08,440 --> 04:23:09,140
Thank you, thank you.

5850
04:23:09,140 --> 04:23:10,360
I'm gonna do it like tomorrow...

5851
04:23:10,360 --> 04:23:10,820
Like not tomorrow.

5852
04:23:10,940 --> 04:23:11,240
Next...

5853
04:23:11,240 --> 04:23:12,100
Next Wukong stream.

5854
04:23:15,640 --> 04:23:17,240
We did it, Pixie!

5855
04:23:17,380 --> 04:23:18,600
What do you mean, me?

5856
04:23:19,500 --> 04:23:19,940
We...

5857
04:23:27,710 --> 04:23:28,870
He's a bad kid!

5858
04:23:29,510 --> 04:23:30,130
He's a bad kid!

5859
04:23:30,130 --> 04:23:30,590
He's a bad kid!

5860
04:23:31,530 --> 04:23:32,610
He's a bad kid!

5861
04:23:35,710 --> 04:23:37,450
You can't do that?

5862
04:23:38,490 --> 04:23:43,750
What are you doing?

5863
04:23:43,750 --> 04:23:46,110
What is he doing?

5864
04:23:51,050 --> 04:23:51,730
Where did you leave this thing?

5865
04:23:51,750 --> 04:23:52,410
Get out of the car!

5866
04:23:52,430 --> 04:23:53,110
Hey!

5867
04:24:05,090 --> 04:24:05,770
We're gonna kill you!

5868
04:24:05,770 --> 04:24:05,850
You're the one who killed Mom!

5869
04:24:05,870 --> 04:24:05,910
The one who killed Mom!

5870
04:24:05,910 --> 04:24:05,990
Why did you do this?

5871
04:24:05,990 --> 04:24:06,090
You killed Mom!

5872
04:24:06,090 --> 04:24:06,350
Why did you do this?

5873
04:24:06,350 --> 04:24:08,410
I wanted to kill this thing.

5874
04:24:08,870 --> 04:24:09,390
I never took it.

5875
04:24:19,490 --> 04:24:19,850
Oh,

5876
04:24:24,610 --> 04:24:25,650
she's giving me the fan.

5877
04:24:25,890 --> 04:24:27,610
I'm going to take the fan and still punish the child.

5878
04:24:32,430 --> 04:24:34,430
He literally has devil horns!

5879
04:24:34,490 --> 04:24:36,370
Like what the fuck do you want me to say?

5880
04:24:44,190 --> 04:24:46,230
Yeah, tomatoes are evil.

5881
04:24:50,750 --> 04:24:51,950
I didn't hesitate.

5882
04:24:52,610 --> 04:24:53,710
Yeah, I'm red.

5883
04:24:58,170 --> 04:25:01,970
Oh yeah, spit out the two-headed pig, please.

5884
04:25:27,990 --> 04:25:29,350
What did he... what?

5885
04:25:34,730 --> 04:25:35,330
No!

5886
04:25:36,700 --> 04:25:42,020
Bro, she raised him for like a hundred fucking plus years and then you do this to her?

5887
04:25:49,140 --> 04:25:52,540
Oh my god, he chose death over dishonor.

5888
04:25:53,600 --> 04:25:55,140
In front of your mom?

5889
04:26:00,390 --> 04:26:01,410
That's crazy.

5890
04:26:01,490 --> 04:26:02,750
He refused to change.

5891
04:26:02,810 --> 04:26:03,210
Yeah.

5892
04:26:03,510 --> 04:26:08,350
He was like, I'd rather cause my parents a million years of grief than fucking change.

5893
04:26:20,060 --> 04:26:21,620
There's the piggies.

5894
04:26:49,640 --> 04:26:52,320
Yeah, piggies.

5895
04:26:56,000 --> 04:27:03,100
You ruined another family.

5896
04:27:03,240 --> 04:27:05,140
It was already fucked!

5897
04:27:05,520 --> 04:27:10,460
That family, there was no saving that family before I came over.

5898
04:27:16,570 --> 04:27:17,570
Is that me?

5899
04:27:21,510 --> 04:27:23,790
Oh, is this when I lost in the heavens?

5900
04:27:23,790 --> 04:27:25,390
The fight against the heavens?

5901
04:27:25,750 --> 04:27:26,770
Oh yeah, this is!

5902
04:27:27,010 --> 04:27:28,050
I'm not wearing the crown.

5903
04:27:29,930 --> 04:27:31,890
Like, that's like me as in I'm Wukong.

5904
04:27:32,150 --> 04:27:33,690
I'm not... Wukong's not wearing the crown.

5905
04:27:34,410 --> 04:27:37,010
This is when he got his absolute shit beat up.

5906
04:27:37,930 --> 04:27:39,610
For defying the heavenly court.

5907
04:27:55,250 --> 04:27:57,090
I'm not gonna do the big text right now.

5908
04:28:07,880 --> 04:28:08,250
Yeah.

5909
04:28:08,620 --> 04:28:10,220
He has so many rebellions, guys.

5910
04:28:10,360 --> 04:28:10,820
Like...

5911
04:28:12,500 --> 04:28:15,220
He never liked the heavenly court.

5912
04:28:24,120 --> 04:28:25,880
Oh, it's after the opening.

5913
04:28:25,880 --> 04:28:26,060
Opening.

5914
04:28:37,720 --> 04:28:39,840
Yeah, the heaven does deserve it though.

5915
04:28:39,880 --> 04:28:40,560
The heavenly court.

5916
04:28:41,000 --> 04:28:42,280
The stuff they did too.

5917
04:28:42,460 --> 04:28:44,560
Because they tried to kill off all the monkeys.

5918
04:28:45,060 --> 04:28:46,320
They didn't like the monkey.

5919
04:29:10,080 --> 04:29:12,060
She manipulated him!

5920
04:29:19,300 --> 04:29:19,780
Bro,

5921
04:29:26,260 --> 04:29:29,440
what the f- This is why you choose a bro over- Oh my god.

5922
04:29:29,460 --> 04:29:32,040
I would never choose the hot lady over the bro.

5923
04:29:32,720 --> 04:29:33,840
I would never.

5924
04:29:36,740 --> 04:29:40,340
I never have undone that in this game.

5925
04:29:46,100 --> 04:29:46,820
Bro...

5926
04:30:12,680 --> 04:30:14,500
What the fuc- What?

5927
04:30:19,780 --> 04:30:22,960
It's because of the crown!

5928
04:30:26,640 --> 04:30:27,120
No!

5929
04:30:27,460 --> 04:30:29,720
Wukong, you're getting brainwashed!

5930
04:30:32,140 --> 04:30:34,940
This is the flashback.

5931
04:30:36,120 --> 04:30:37,560
This is the flashback.

5932
04:30:37,560 --> 04:30:38,860
This is the flashback.

5933
04:30:38,860 --> 04:30:39,020
This is the flashback.

5934
04:30:39,020 --> 04:30:39,160
This is the flashback.

5935
04:30:39,160 --> 04:30:40,580
If you always say shit like that, it's a Yeah.

5936
04:30:54,600 --> 04:30:56,920
He looks so evil part.

5937
04:31:06,630 --> 04:31:07,770
Yeah, he looks so evil!

5938
04:31:07,770 --> 04:31:10,350
He seems so evil because it's from the bull King's perspective.

5939
04:31:23,540 --> 04:31:23,920
I didn't notice that!

5940
04:31:24,120 --> 04:31:25,100
I was like, oh it's him!

5941
04:31:25,440 --> 04:31:27,760
There's an animated series with that show.

5942
04:31:27,840 --> 04:31:30,520
I used to watch it growing up in Asia.

5943
04:32:17,700 --> 04:32:20,620
Oh, that's why he did all of that!

5944
04:32:23,840 --> 04:32:26,580
He tried to get power so he could...

5945
04:32:27,240 --> 04:32:34,440
He could fight for his brothers, but it doesn't matter whatever he does, because the heavenly court was like, I hate you and you're conned!

5946
04:32:41,340 --> 04:32:48,560
He wanted to try to sacrifice everything for his brothers.

5947
04:32:49,640 --> 04:32:50,940
His blood brothers.

5948
04:32:51,160 --> 04:32:52,100
Not blood brothers, sorry.

5949
04:32:52,180 --> 04:32:52,520
His...

5950
04:33:05,080 --> 04:33:06,660
He did it for the bros!

5951
04:33:14,080 --> 04:33:16,180
Brothers in arms, yeah brothers in arms!

5952
04:33:16,380 --> 04:33:16,900
Sworn brothers.

5953
04:33:17,140 --> 04:33:21,180
That's why I was trying to say sworn brothers just like Lu Bei, Guan Yin, Dong Fei.

5954
04:33:24,900 --> 04:33:25,940
That's so sad.

5955
04:33:27,260 --> 04:33:29,580
I knew that wife was bad news.

5956
04:33:31,380 --> 04:33:32,660
She's so manipulative.

5957
04:33:32,700 --> 04:33:34,940
Trying to put herself in between her and the bros.

5958
04:33:35,740 --> 04:33:36,620
Told you guys.

5959
04:33:37,140 --> 04:33:39,420
Always choose... bros!

5960
04:33:39,620 --> 04:33:40,460
Choose the bros!

5961
04:33:40,460 --> 04:33:40,460
Choose the bros!

5962
04:33:40,460 --> 04:33:42,940
Bro, no matter how hot the lady is...

5963
04:34:03,460 --> 04:34:03,980
Yay!

5964
04:34:09,960 --> 04:34:12,160
Okay, I'm level 89 now.

5965
04:34:12,420 --> 04:34:13,260
Holy shit.

5966
04:34:15,280 --> 04:34:16,360
It's a high level.

5967
04:34:21,710 --> 04:34:24,330
Create a hurricane that lifts the enemy airborne.

5968
04:34:24,910 --> 04:34:26,590
Whoa, that's useful.

5969
04:34:27,210 --> 04:34:28,010
There's me!

5970
04:34:28,410 --> 04:34:29,510
I'm over here.

5971
04:34:31,270 --> 04:34:33,050
All right, let's just stay.

5972
04:34:48,390 --> 04:34:50,370
I mean, he got mega immortality.

5973
04:34:51,450 --> 04:34:55,030
He has immortality, immortality, immortality, immortality.

5974
04:34:55,150 --> 04:34:55,890
He was a little shit.

5975
04:35:00,690 --> 04:35:01,410
All right.

5976
04:35:02,550 --> 04:35:04,670
He had way too many immortalities.

5977
04:35:07,190 --> 04:35:08,870
I mean, would you really trust Wukong?

5978
04:35:08,990 --> 04:35:09,910
He was a little shit.

5979
04:35:10,330 --> 04:35:10,810
Hahahaha.

5980
04:35:11,750 --> 04:35:12,230
...

5981
04:35:13,010 --> 04:35:13,490
...

5982
04:35:14,370 --> 04:35:14,850
...

5983
04:35:18,510 --> 04:35:19,190
...

5984
04:35:26,700 --> 04:35:28,580
Who needs that much immortality?

5985
04:35:28,740 --> 04:35:32,440
I mean, if the gods really hated you that much, I mean...

5986
04:35:32,980 --> 04:35:36,420
I mean, like, the gods...

5987
04:35:36,420 --> 04:35:39,420
The heavenly court really, really hated him.

5988
04:35:41,400 --> 04:35:42,080
...

5989
04:35:42,080 --> 04:35:43,100
...

5990
04:35:43,100 --> 04:35:43,440
...

5991
04:35:44,660 --> 04:35:45,000
...

5992
04:35:47,400 --> 04:35:47,920
...

5993
04:35:47,920 --> 04:35:48,820
...

5994
04:35:51,060 --> 04:35:51,580
...

5995
04:35:54,380 --> 04:35:54,900
...

5996
04:35:57,560 --> 04:35:58,080
...

5997
04:36:02,910 --> 04:36:03,090
...

5998
04:36:03,090 --> 04:36:06,350
All right, you should have had seven times the mortality, you're right.

5999
04:36:06,530 --> 04:36:09,890
This is the princess in Mo Yun Dong, Princess of the Wings, she has millions of deaths...

6000
04:36:09,890 --> 04:36:10,250
...

6001
04:36:10,250 --> 04:36:13,030
...The real her.

6002
04:36:14,670 --> 04:36:17,750
Oh, wait, no, that's the evil one, never mind.

6003
04:36:19,630 --> 04:36:20,570
It's not the...

6004
04:36:24,310 --> 04:36:25,670
Sorry, that's so mom.

6005
04:36:30,230 --> 04:36:31,910
What happened to her?

6006
04:36:35,130 --> 04:36:37,150
I can't believe it.

6007
04:36:37,330 --> 04:36:39,170
We were never able to see.

6008
04:36:39,310 --> 04:36:41,090
She was never real.

6009
04:36:41,750 --> 04:36:44,530
She's real, but she was also never real.

6010
04:37:07,670 --> 04:37:09,570
She doesn't even know we exist.

6011
04:37:09,670 --> 04:37:11,430
No, she does because we fucking killed her mom.

6012
04:37:11,590 --> 04:37:12,190
No, she...

6013
04:37:12,890 --> 04:37:15,390
Guys, no, she definitely know we existed.

6014
04:37:16,590 --> 04:37:18,290
We literally killed her mom.

6015
04:37:23,610 --> 04:37:24,650
She was perfect.

6016
04:37:24,810 --> 04:37:27,650
She doesn't have that many polygons, so I didn't like.

6017
04:37:34,580 --> 04:37:35,600
Alright, let's see.

6018
04:37:35,640 --> 04:37:36,420
Let's go to the next chapter.

6019
04:37:36,520 --> 04:37:37,780
I want to see the beginning of the next chapter.

6020
04:37:39,720 --> 04:37:40,600
It's my bad.

6021
04:37:42,760 --> 04:37:44,480
Yeah, but we let it happen.

6022
04:37:44,920 --> 04:37:46,000
We were there.

6023
04:37:46,080 --> 04:37:47,140
We didn't stop him.

6024
04:37:59,180 --> 04:38:00,880
We can see her?

6025
04:38:04,880 --> 04:38:06,320
Oh my god, I want to see her.

6026
04:38:19,180 --> 04:38:20,600
I want to see her.

6027
04:38:20,620 --> 04:38:21,560
She's real to me.

6028
04:38:21,780 --> 04:38:23,920
I want her to know I exist.

6029
04:38:43,090 --> 04:38:45,410
I would never choose her over my bro.

6030
04:38:48,570 --> 04:38:51,910
Guys, we're almost there to the final quest.

6031
04:39:05,850 --> 04:39:06,570
Let's find our mausoleum.

6032
04:39:06,570 --> 04:39:06,730
A mausoleum?

6033
04:39:06,730 --> 04:39:10,370
Alright, where is the mausoleum?

6034
04:39:12,970 --> 04:39:17,910
I need to find that first.

6035
04:39:17,910 --> 04:39:19,430
I don't know if I can find it in this cellar.

6036
04:39:19,430 --> 04:39:19,470
And it's probably right here.

6037
04:39:19,470 --> 04:39:20,490
I believe we need to find the mausoleum.

6038
04:39:20,550 --> 04:39:21,270
Where is it?

6039
04:39:22,590 --> 04:39:23,630
The mausoleum is here.

6040
04:39:23,630 --> 04:39:24,910
The mausoleum is in this cellar.

6041
04:39:26,650 --> 04:39:27,010
Alright.

6042
04:39:27,010 --> 04:39:27,090
The temple of the dead?

6043
04:39:27,110 --> 04:39:27,250
Where is the shrine?

6044
04:39:27,250 --> 04:39:27,670
Where is the malgyou?

6045
04:39:35,820 --> 04:39:37,180
Alright, the shrine is a pet.

6046
04:39:37,280 --> 04:39:39,380
Let's activate an artifact real quick though.

6047
04:39:40,600 --> 04:39:44,000
Alright, a strong body of certain destiny.

6048
04:39:44,200 --> 04:39:47,600
Nimble body massively reduces the stamina cost of all charge.

6049
04:39:48,280 --> 04:39:50,000
Considerably increases maximum health.

6050
04:39:50,060 --> 04:39:51,880
Considerably increases forward beam.

6051
04:39:52,020 --> 04:39:52,600
Alright, which one?

6052
04:39:52,820 --> 04:39:53,720
One, two, or three?

6053
04:39:54,080 --> 04:39:54,860
Maybe one?

6054
04:39:59,720 --> 04:40:01,000
Is it one or two?

6055
04:40:01,000 --> 04:40:01,280
Two.

6056
04:40:01,900 --> 04:40:03,640
I know three would be good.

6057
04:40:03,880 --> 04:40:05,280
One or two or three?

6058
04:40:05,940 --> 04:40:06,560
Two?

6059
04:40:09,670 --> 04:40:10,610
Alright, two.

6060
04:40:11,710 --> 04:40:13,670
Alright, how considerably is it?

6061
04:40:13,810 --> 04:40:15,070
I can't even tell.

6062
04:40:17,010 --> 04:40:21,970
I can't even tell how much they... Oh shit!

6063
04:40:22,710 --> 04:40:24,810
Oh, is this the heavenly court?

6064
04:40:25,230 --> 04:40:26,550
They came from the heavens!

6065
04:40:26,910 --> 04:40:28,490
Oh, they're trying to stop me!

6066
04:40:31,530 --> 04:40:32,270
What the?

6067
04:40:32,370 --> 04:40:32,490
Fuck!

6068
04:40:35,170 --> 04:40:36,570
They came from the skies!

6069
04:40:38,710 --> 04:40:41,350
For the heavenly court, they're fucking weak as hell.

6070
04:40:42,150 --> 04:40:44,990
They're not happy at all.

6071
04:40:45,230 --> 04:40:45,950
I don't understand.

6072
04:40:47,670 --> 04:40:49,570
Why can't they be happy?

6073
04:40:49,670 --> 04:40:51,050
They should be happy for me.

6074
04:40:51,170 --> 04:40:51,730
I'm fucking...

6075
04:40:54,010 --> 04:40:55,050
I wonder why.

6076
04:40:55,550 --> 04:40:59,190
I wonder why they're not happy about me.

6077
04:40:59,310 --> 04:41:00,110
Oh my god!

6078
04:41:00,290 --> 04:41:03,010
Okay, maybe I did not have to use big baby.

6079
04:41:03,250 --> 04:41:05,190
Like, holy shit!

6080
04:41:07,990 --> 04:41:09,170
What did it look like?

6081
04:41:09,630 --> 04:41:11,070
The eagle soldier.

6082
04:41:11,210 --> 04:41:12,110
Oh, they're eagles?

6083
04:41:12,910 --> 04:41:14,530
Oh, they're dogs too!

6084
04:41:14,810 --> 04:41:14,930
Oh!

6085
04:41:17,230 --> 04:41:18,230
It's not fair.

6086
04:41:18,530 --> 04:41:22,610
How come they hate monkeys so much but they still recruit furries into their court?

6087
04:41:25,510 --> 04:41:27,130
Like... It's not fair.

6088
04:41:27,630 --> 04:41:28,570
Fuck this.

6089
04:41:28,710 --> 04:41:31,510
I'm just gonna... Okay, I can't.

6090
04:41:31,570 --> 04:41:31,910
There's two more.

6091
04:41:31,910 --> 04:41:31,910
I'm just gonna...

6092
04:41:31,910 --> 04:41:32,470
I am too many of them.

6093
04:41:34,740 --> 04:41:36,070
What do the eagles have?

6094
04:41:36,310 --> 04:41:37,870
Oh, just cause they can fly.

6095
04:41:38,490 --> 04:41:40,390
They don't need them.

6096
04:41:43,190 --> 04:41:48,250
Like, just cause they can fly doesn't make them better than me.

6097
04:41:53,710 --> 04:41:54,370
Alright.

6098
04:41:55,870 --> 04:41:56,530
Nice!

6099
04:42:01,180 --> 04:42:02,920
They follow orders.

6100
04:42:02,920 --> 04:42:04,960
I can follow orders sometimes!

6101
04:42:08,320 --> 04:42:11,860
Not all the time, but sometimes.

6102
04:42:16,600 --> 04:42:18,000
Okay, let's see.

6103
04:42:18,080 --> 04:42:21,800
Well, at least I can make this, I guess.

6104
04:42:22,640 --> 04:42:24,340
At least I can make this.

6105
04:42:25,700 --> 04:42:28,820
Unleash the rage with a significantly increasing damage.

6106
04:42:29,440 --> 04:42:32,400
Okay, yeah, we're not getting off board with that.

6107
04:42:33,320 --> 04:42:33,680
Alright.

6108
04:42:37,210 --> 04:42:37,570
Nice.

6109
04:42:38,210 --> 04:42:39,190
Okay, we got this.

6110
04:42:42,050 --> 04:42:45,470
Alright, let us head to... what is it called?

6111
04:42:46,370 --> 04:42:47,330
Where do we have to go?

6112
04:42:47,530 --> 04:42:48,490
In the...

6113
04:42:54,280 --> 04:42:56,860
Where do we have to go for Chapter... Pagoda?

6114
04:42:58,280 --> 04:42:59,380
What the fuck is a pagoda?

6115
04:42:59,960 --> 04:43:01,060
Oh, is it the Great Pagoda?

6116
04:43:02,600 --> 04:43:03,520
I just saw it.

6117
04:43:03,700 --> 04:43:04,320
Oh, here we go.

6118
04:43:04,440 --> 04:43:04,960
Here, right?

6119
04:43:06,140 --> 04:43:08,860
Alright, we're gonna save that for next time.

6120
04:43:10,040 --> 04:43:11,240
Okay, we're gonna...

6121
04:43:11,720 --> 04:43:16,880
We're gonna save that for next time, because you guys are saying it's gonna take a while, so I'm gonna...

6122
04:43:17,400 --> 04:43:20,260
I'm gonna save that for another day.

6123
04:43:22,600 --> 04:43:23,040
Alright!

6124
04:43:23,980 --> 04:43:26,660
We made a lot of progress, honestly.

6125
04:43:27,660 --> 04:43:29,480
We made so much progress today.

6126
04:43:29,560 --> 04:43:30,460
I'm proud of us, chat.

6127
04:43:31,900 --> 04:43:33,460
I'm so proud of us.

6128
04:43:33,460 --> 04:43:37,140
We actually... We made a lot of progress today.

6129
04:43:37,320 --> 04:43:42,960
I mean, we finished an entire chapter in one stream, so that's really good.

6130
04:43:43,120 --> 04:43:48,380
I guess, technically, can we beat the game in one more stream?

6131
04:43:51,510 --> 04:43:53,310
Can we technically...

6132
04:43:53,810 --> 04:43:54,970
Can we technically...

6133
04:43:57,270 --> 04:44:00,370
Can we technically beat the game in one more stream?

6134
04:44:00,990 --> 04:44:02,670
It was a good set of one and...

6135
04:44:02,670 --> 04:44:03,550
Full first try.

6136
04:44:03,590 --> 04:44:04,810
Yeah, full day of first try.

6137
04:44:04,810 --> 04:44:05,710
I don't wanna break the streak.

6138
04:44:06,110 --> 04:44:06,550
I...

6139
04:44:09,850 --> 04:44:11,330
Guys, I don't...

6140
04:44:11,330 --> 04:44:12,490
I don't wanna...

6141
04:44:12,490 --> 04:44:14,990
I don't wanna break the streak of first tries, guys.

6142
04:44:15,070 --> 04:44:15,490
So, I...

6143
04:44:15,490 --> 04:44:17,330
I don't wanna risk it.

6144
04:44:17,430 --> 04:44:21,710
I wanna end the stream today with a full set of first tries.

6145
04:44:26,170 --> 04:44:27,850
So, we're gonna keep it there.

6146
04:44:28,190 --> 04:44:29,190
That was a great stream!

6147
04:44:31,270 --> 04:44:32,470
Kaya, thank you for the super chat.

6148
04:44:32,530 --> 04:44:33,170
Thank you, thank you.

6149
04:44:33,170 --> 04:44:33,810
Nice first tries.

6150
04:44:33,850 --> 04:44:34,050
Yes.

6151
04:44:34,810 --> 04:44:35,510
I'm proud of myself.

6152
04:44:36,930 --> 04:44:38,750
We even first tried the frog.

6153
04:44:38,950 --> 04:44:40,410
He was the bane of my existence.

6154
04:44:40,750 --> 04:44:42,270
But, like, we fucking did it, guys.

6155
04:44:42,570 --> 04:44:45,630
He fucking did it.

6156
04:44:45,730 --> 04:44:47,410
He was actually...

6157
04:44:47,410 --> 04:44:49,090
It was so rough.

6158
04:44:51,690 --> 04:44:54,210
It was so fucking rough.

6159
04:44:54,570 --> 04:44:56,250
But we fucking did it.

6160
04:44:57,150 --> 04:44:58,350
I'm so happy.

6161
04:44:58,590 --> 04:45:02,470
The frog didn't absolutely destroy me.

6162
04:45:02,470 --> 04:45:03,970
I'm so happy.

6163
04:45:09,070 --> 04:45:09,990
Anyway, guys.

6164
04:45:11,070 --> 04:45:11,510
Anyway.

6165
04:45:11,590 --> 04:45:13,510
I am going to call it here.

6166
04:45:13,570 --> 04:45:15,170
Tomorrow, I do have a stream.

6167
04:45:15,370 --> 04:45:22,130
I will be doing the V for Mirai watch-a-long stream for the very first VTuber that's gonna be coming up.

6168
04:45:22,150 --> 04:45:23,470
Which would be Paan.

6169
04:45:23,630 --> 04:45:24,890
I believe that's her name.

6170
04:45:25,030 --> 04:45:26,130
Paama Paan, I think.

6171
04:45:26,470 --> 04:45:29,670
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry if I pronounced her name incorrectly.

6172
04:45:30,050 --> 04:45:30,870
I don't know.

6173
04:45:31,050 --> 04:45:32,450
I don't know what her full name is.

6174
04:45:32,450 --> 04:45:33,850
I don't know how to pronounce her.

6175
04:45:33,990 --> 04:45:38,470
But I'll be watching their first debut at, I guess, like, 4 p.m.

6176
04:45:39,230 --> 04:45:40,070
And then...

6177
04:45:40,590 --> 04:45:42,930
Yeah, and then raiding into their second...

6178
04:45:43,450 --> 04:45:44,290
Okay, pull my palm.

6179
04:45:44,470 --> 04:45:45,010
Okay, there you go.

6180
04:45:45,070 --> 04:45:45,550
I said it correctly.

6181
04:45:45,810 --> 04:45:51,070
And then I will be raiding into their second stream, which will be for Laiko Liana.

6182
04:45:51,870 --> 04:45:52,410
So, yeah.

6183
04:45:52,430 --> 04:45:55,150
I'll make a waiting room tomorrow because I don't have the thumbnail yet.

6184
04:45:55,590 --> 04:45:58,330
My thumbnail maker is still on YouTube.

6185
04:45:58,530 --> 04:45:59,110
On YouTube.

6186
04:45:59,250 --> 04:46:01,010
I'm gonna be streaming it on YouTube.

6187
04:46:01,010 --> 04:46:05,110
And I will have the waiting room up, I think, like, tomorrow.

6188
04:46:05,290 --> 04:46:07,950
Because I don't have the thumbnail yet.

6189
04:46:08,090 --> 04:46:10,570
My thumbnail maker is still making the thumbnail.

6190
04:46:10,590 --> 04:46:14,250
So, the moment the thumbnail is done, I'll put the waiting room up.

6191
04:46:14,430 --> 04:46:14,970
Anyway, guys.

6192
04:46:15,070 --> 04:46:16,090
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6193
04:46:16,230 --> 04:46:19,710
As always, everyone, stay hydrated, pause to check it out, and move around to get that blood flowing.

6194
04:46:20,010 --> 04:46:22,390
If you suffer me, head to bed because you deserve it.

6195
04:46:22,430 --> 04:46:23,690
Also, let me chill a little bit.

6196
04:46:23,810 --> 04:46:26,570
Do you guys know I have the Hyatt PC cases?

6197
04:46:26,670 --> 04:46:27,910
Guys, I haven't chilled in a while.

6198
04:46:28,030 --> 04:46:28,230
So...

6199
04:46:30,150 --> 04:46:30,990
Guys, did you hear that?

6200
04:46:30,990 --> 04:46:35,410
Did you guys know I have a Jokey Bird custom PC, guys?

6201
04:46:36,370 --> 04:46:38,430
Guys, did you guys know that?

6202
04:46:38,610 --> 04:46:40,070
It's, like, so cool.

6203
04:46:40,430 --> 04:46:42,030
Like, guys, please.

6204
04:46:46,310 --> 04:46:49,390
I'm trying to chill because I realized I haven't chilled in a while.

6205
04:46:49,710 --> 04:46:50,490
Anyway, guys.

6206
04:46:51,050 --> 04:46:51,790
Well, no.

6207
04:46:51,870 --> 04:46:53,210
They're pre-orders.

6208
04:46:53,270 --> 04:46:55,290
So, there's no selling out.

6209
04:46:56,350 --> 04:46:57,970
They're pre-orders.

6210
04:46:58,010 --> 04:46:59,610
So, there's no selling out.

6211
04:46:59,610 --> 04:47:01,050
But, yes.

6212
04:47:01,150 --> 04:47:09,310
We have the Jokey Bird PC case, keycaps, desk mat, acrylic keychain, and wall scrolls.

6213
04:47:09,310 --> 04:47:09,570
So, yeah.

6214
04:47:10,090 --> 04:47:20,150
If you guys want some, you know, custom Jokey Bird PC case and everything and keycaps, go check that out.

6215
04:47:20,250 --> 04:47:20,670
Anyway, guys.

6216
04:47:20,750 --> 04:47:21,830
I'm going to see you guys later, everybody.

6217
04:47:22,310 --> 04:47:22,850
Bye.
