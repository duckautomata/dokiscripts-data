00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,660
Hello, everyone.

2
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,640
Good morning.

3
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,300
Good morning.

4
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,660
Yes, I do not sound like I want to die in Minecraft right now because I had a good night's sleep.

5
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,220
Yay!

6
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh, that reminds me.

7
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,680
I need to do my chewable, my vitamin C chewable real quick.

8
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,120
Get that orange, those oranges in my system.

10
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:00,900
I was so tired.

11
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,300
I think it's like...

12
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,800
Like, during the Batman stream yesterday, I was yawning a lot.

13
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,060
I think my body, I think it's because, like, I had to wake up early last, yesterday.

14
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,720
Not last night.

15
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,140
I don't remember.

16
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,760
Why was I had to wake up early yesterday?

17
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,420
I don't even remember.

18
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,840
No, I didn't wake up early.

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,860

28
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,340

He didn't take me on the side quest.

45
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,460
And now we're here.

46
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:51,920

57
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,040
I was like binge watching like a couple of like robot spy videos and they're like narrated by David Tennant.

58
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,900
Um for those who don't know he's like the only doctor I respect and doctor who.

59
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,940
Uh and there was one I had to talk to you about this because this is so fucking funny.

60
00:09:01,600 --> 00:10:03,780
Um there are actually two videos where they're like their ones with a monkey and the other one was a gorilla and um so um the girl the monkeys were like I want to take care of this chat because they're all like robots of like babies you know they're like baby robots for the monkey and the um the gorilla so then the other monkeys when they saw the robot monkey they're like i have to take care of this child you know they're like what is this child doing they're all alone where are your parents and so they were trying to like gank the robot off like the branches like off of this like log and stuff that he was like supposed to be like glued to and he's like come with me you and then they one of the monkeys yanked the yanked the robot off of the log and then she dropped it it's not like she just dropped it from you know like the ground she was on a tree and then she dropped a baby robot and then you know the baby robot was just like

61
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:18,280
and it obviously they all thought it was dead they're like oh no God, I'm burning a child.

62
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,800
And it was like, you know, they literally just like gave these monkeys trauma because it was like, it was like a tribe.

63
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,360
So all the monkeys were surrounding here.

64
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,240
It was like, what did you do, Sharon?

65
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,500
What the fuck did you do?

66
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,980
Because like I saw, I saw the thumbnail and I was like, what the fuck?

67
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,720
And all these monkeys were like green, like having a little funeral.

68
00:10:45,740 --> 00:11:15,880
for the fucking tiny ass robot and i was like oh my god like i i swear to god these monkeys have fucking trauma right now like wait let me show you guys i gotta show you guys the picture i saw this thumbnail i was like oh like that's like that's what the you know they thought that you know they obviously if i see that i'd be like that's a fucking dead monkey and obviously the Like,

69
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
oh my god, I killed him.

70
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
I killed a child.

71
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,020
So they were all like grieving it and having a little like fucking monkey funeral.

72
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,800
Like, dude, that's so messed up.

73
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,180
I'll show you, I'll give you guys the link so you can watch it on your own time.

74
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:39,080
There's another one where they had like a, they had like a snake robot and they made it participate in a snake orgy.

75
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,960
It was fun.

76
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,720
But the snake robot was like, was like six times the size of all the others.

77
00:11:45,740 --> 00:12:00,960
snakes but they didn't care they're like let's go have some fun but anyway there was this other um there was this other video on um where um where it was a gorilla it was a gorilla robot and

78
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:46,720
um and like basically uh one of the child there another this one was a child ran up to the and he was like let's play because like if you beat your chest like you know when adults gorillas beat their chest um it means they want to fight but when like babies like children gorillas beat their chest it means they're like let's play yeah let's play um so the gorilla robot the gorilla robot like knows how to beat their chest and stuff so you know they're like he was like initiating play with this other child with this real child uh real child gorilla and um And then like,

79
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,840
you know, they're like, the child was like, Yippee, friend.

80
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,500
And then he pushes the robot to the ground.

81
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,410
Friend!

82
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,870
And then he's like, oh.

83
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,870
And then, you know, the robot doesn't know how to get up.

84
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,570
So the child was like looking at the robot.

85
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,230
It was like, are you okay?

86
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,110
He's just like, hello?

87
00:13:14,370 --> 00:14:30,450
And then, you know, the robot was just, you know, there like no movement and then so like like you know it literally gave the girl the baby child gorilla trauma because he's like oh my god did i did i kill him and he literally like looks at the robot and it just fucking runs away and he runs away and it was like i wasn't me it wasn't me but i'll show you guys the um i'll give you guys the link to that too i was just like jesus christ i love the comments too um gorilla robot spy i've been like i told you guys i was like i was like in this little rabbit hole of fucking robot spy because it's so interesting it's really um it's such it's such they're so interesting like the the whole premise of like sending a fucking a robot spy into like random places in the world and like infiltrating little like infiltrating like animal like um animal groups and stuff and you know they're just like he's he's just you know when he see the robot he's like yeah he's just a little special like

88
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:45,530
he's just like yeah he's just that's jerry he's just a little special he hasn't moved from that Like, you know, we don't want to, we don't want to make him feel weird.

89
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,190
Yeah, I like this.

90
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,590
Imagine asking the new kid at school to play with you.

91
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,630
And he suddenly falls down and dies.

92
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:00,930
Nobody.

93
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,850
BBC Mix Gorilla Baby thinks he killed a brother.

94
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,890
Let me see if I can grab a screenshot.

95
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,150
Oh, yeah, here.

96
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:23,530
And he's fam- I forgot, okay, the best part is that the robot gorilla, after he pushes him, he- he does the family guy pose.

97
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,590
That's the- what do I mean by that?

98
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,410
So stupid.

99
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,030
He actually does the fucking-

100
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,250
Quote.

101
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,450
Um, thank you for the super chat.

102
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:47,850
Thank you.

103
00:15:48,590 --> 00:16:20,410
gorillas beat their chest it's fine but when i'm being like i'm the bad i guess you gotta go in the forest and live with the gorilla's kill thank you for the super chat thank you thank you um but yeah no like that baby gorilla freaked the fuck out because he thought he actually killed another gorilla um um burnout well thank you for the 10 gift and chips thank you thank you i really appreciate it but yeah no that's like the little rabbit hole that was in last night I think I remember talking about this before it,

104
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:29,770
but it's crazy that the sounds you hear from these like nature documentaries and clips, they're not real.

105
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,970
I don't know if you guys know that.

106
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:39,390
I talked, I remember talking about it before on stream, but for those who didn't watch that stream, they actually like manufacture the sounds like the folly, like, you know, like folly sound aside.

107
00:16:39,390 --> 00:17:36,210
where they get this like where they get it they get a guy and they just fucking i don't know um hit some on the floor yeah like they're not real so if i i know i it's always every time i listen to like the sound design like the sound from the it sounds like it comes from the fucking clips um but because they're like the people who are filming these you know not from the spy cameras they're filming from like hundreds of miles away and they just have a really really expensive camera that they zoom in because their whole thing is that you're not supposed to you're not supposed to interrupt like you're not supposed to interfere with nature even if you see like a fucking child dying you're not supposed to ruin the like you're not supposed to interfere so because of that obviously the camera can actually pick up the sounds um of what they're uh like what it's actually happening so so they have to add like fake sound effects and everything So,

108
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:47,310
you know, if you hear like gorillas being like You hear like the The grass and the forest moving and stuff And on these clips, they're not real It's just some guy fucking getting a bunch Of leaves and being like

109
00:17:51,890 --> 00:19:05,270
That's what you're hearing You're not actually hearing the gorillas Walking around in the forest It's literally some guy being like With his bunch of some fucking leaves In a sound booth Yeah, it's so interesting I remember watching a I always remember watching a clip about that being like oh yeah no you really think like this close-up video we have of like of these ants working and I'm do you really think that we have like some guy like walking up to the ants and putting like a sound booth like like like on those boom microphones you know like like a microphone boom microphone on these ants like really fucking tiny microphone while while we're documenting these goddamn ads and stuff uh the ad side yeah can you guys clip on these ad size microphones real quick we're trying to we're trying to make a documentary about you guys um um man i thought that was super interesting and i was like i was just binge watching a couple of these videos there's one where There's one with a robot puppy,

110
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,950
like there was a robot wolf puppy, a wolf cub, and then the mom saw it and she's like, that ain't right.

111
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,270
And she like kidnapped it and threw it.

112
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:19,390
And like she kidnapped it and she's like, children, get away from him.

113
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,250
He ain't right.

114
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:31,330
And like she grabbed the robot cub, the robot wolf cub and like took it like, I don't know, five miles away and then like threw it away and was like, don't come back.

115
00:19:35,840 --> 00:20:51,180
yeah she was like skinwalker get away from the kids like i was like jesus christ and then the guy was like this was the last thing the robot the spy film because the wolf also broke the camera too and i'm like damn that's let's be like hundreds of thousands of dollars to to build that fucking spy camera because it has to be you know obviously like it's a robot too so like you have to be able to control it from far away so there's like the debutante was like this was the last thing the robot spy was able to film anyway hi hi bro mania I'm super excited to check it out usually you know I don't really play demos I wait until the uh the full release day of a game but I've actually have been of this game for a while because it was so interesting i saw it like i think i remember i started seeing it on twitter and i've always been very interested in alice and wonderland and um like you know the other stories like you know through the um i think the other ones like through the looking glass oh

116
00:20:51,180 --> 00:22:04,360
it is a through the looking guy last um i want to make sure um yeah so yeah it's through the looking glass um but i've always been very interested in uh um in Lewis Carroll stories um in this world and I remember like one of my first uh games I played uh was Alice uh was out like American McGee's Alice and I remember going to like the EA what's it called uh GameStop or is GameStop the American one or is it EA Games it's EA Games the no not EB games EB Games is a Canadian version of yeah EB Games is the Canadian version of GameStop and I remember every time I go to games they would have these little like um cutout boards of uh American McGee's Alice of the Cheshire cat and um and like other stuff it was always there so I always but I was too young to play the game because you know I was a fucking child and I but like it interested me I was very like you know I was still like a scary cat but I've always seen those cutouts of um American Big E's Alice and also like you know the the the PC

117
00:22:04,360 --> 00:23:12,560
boxes of it and I've always wanted to play it and you know like recently I think like two years ago I was able to play on stream for you guys um but the concept of it um was always like so intriguing because like you know it's like a dark take of Alice in Wonderland and and then another adaptation that's what drew me into this like like with Wonderland and everything was there were two games on Newgrounds that was very popular at that time um I think they made more but I'm not too sure but I'm playing two of them and it was like who like I think it was like it was like a murder mystery uh and you were trying to figure out like who killed the white rabbit um and you're playing as like yeah it was Alice Alice is dead because um and i remember like also white rabbit was also dead because you found his body later on but it was alice is dead and it was i've always loved that game because like the art style and the story was just so interesting and i remember playing it on newgrounds um a

118
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:54,540
lot back then and um because like it was i i don't know it was just something about that story and like i always played a lot of new ground games but the Alice's Dead series was always like stuck in my mind as one of my favorite new ground games I played growing up um so there's just something about like these takes on Wonderland and like how like especially if it's like dark takes on Wonderland because you can do so much about it because Wonderland is like basically like the imaginations of Alice of a child so it's like you know it can be anything it's Wonderland um also but But fuck Tim Burton's version of Allison.

119
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
That one I fucking didn't understand.

120
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,780
It's crazy because like, Allison Wonderland is all about like nonsensical things and like things supposed to not make sense.

121
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,280
But like Tim Burton's version of Wonderland, like I don't even, I don't know.

122
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,540
Like, yes, yes, it's Wonderland's all about things not making sense.

123
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,120
But that shit, that is just, I don't know.

124
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,360
That one was just too wild, too wild for me.

125
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,120
I don't understand why people are like, oh yeah, Timmeray is one of those.

126
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
So it's not, I don't think it's that good.

127
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:45,060
I personally, I don't even like the concept and the, because it was, the colors were, the cinematography and the color correction was really weird too.

128
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,640
And then like, you know, Johnny Depp, he's a good actor.

129
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,860
But him as the, I remember when he started dancing.

130
00:24:52,640 --> 00:26:16,540
in his shoes I'm like what the fuck is he doing like yeah I get it he's a mad hatter but what why is he dancing why is he why is he tap dancing I don't understand where is my fucking tea party where is it why is my mad hatter tap dancing for me right now um but I I never fucking that was like the one the only version the only adaptation of Wonderland that I just did not like it was and then they're like it's not called Wonderland it's actually Underland and I'm like bro what the fuck you had one job and you can't even get the fucking name right like yeah they're like yeah Alice misheard the name um um the name of the of the world it's called underland not wonderland and i'm like what i thought that one was really dumb but for those who do like the movie um you know it's all preferences for me i just i just didn't like understand the plot very well because it was all for me it felt like it was all over the place and um and um and it it was just so it was hard for me to follow along to

131
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:46,740
the movie because i know it's all about nonsensical things but even then i was like even if it is a nonsensical i still would like to be able to follow the apply of what's going on as well as the dialogue um but yeah no i like all the other adaptations too i like the alice american mcgee's alice oh yeah by the way american mcgee had like a breakdown on twitter earlier because he was like um because um they were trying to make the third um um,

132
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,580
that's a third game for the, um, the Alice series.

133
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,960
Um, but then like EA game canceled it because they're like, that's too much money, bro.

134
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,400
Like your madness return didn't even make that much.

135
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:10,860
Um, and then he had a breakdown on Twitter because like people keep posting like, uh, gifts or like aesthetic gifts of, um, Alice make like, of American McGee's Alice.

136
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,400
And he was like, Where were you guys when we needed you?

137
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,320
I'm like, bro, bro, you gotta move on, bro.

138
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm sorry.

139
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,800
I'm sorry, bro.

140
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,260
You gotta move on.

141
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,500
Blaming the fans is not the right move, man.

142
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:38,300
Yeah, he had like a, he had like, he wrote like a fucking, I think it was like six paragraphs.

143
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,480
Oh, yeah, girl, I'm sorry.

144
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,400
I was 11.

145
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,860
I didn't have income.

146
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,680
Yeah.

147
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,740
Yeah, it was too, it was just too far ahead.

148
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,040
It was too far ahead of his time, bro.

149
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Like, you got, you had to make the game when Hot Topic was more hot.

150
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:05,500
Like, honestly, if he made the game and had a brand deal with Hot Topic, he could have had his third game, honestly.

151
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,060
From merch alone, it would have funded that shit.

152
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:40,920
um he just it was just the wrong game at the wrong time he really needed hot topic to be involved like if invader zim was able to be revived because hot topic is was selling their fucking 100th collaboration from invader zim after the show had ended for like 20 plus years then like honestly it would have worked out for him like that literally brought back invader Zim because people were still buying Invader Zim merch at Hot Topic.

153
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,920
But yeah, no, I'm super interested.

154
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,240
Like I said, I was following the development of this game for a while now, and the concept seems very interesting.

155
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,640
So I'm really looking forward to playing the demo today.

156
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,460
It is a very short demo, but after that I do have a lot of stuff to do after the stream.

157
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:32,740
so this may or may not just be like under two hours um just to give you guys a little warning and um but yeah let's go check it out I don't really know much about like the story itself um but I just saw like you know I saw the little trailer and it's like it just it just like hooked me in because the trailer seemed like really cool um and the art style too I love this artist art style

158
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,660
is alive today or any of my sound guys are alive

159
00:29:45,300 --> 00:30:22,460
all right let's look at settings all right dark fast dialogue speed just in case um uh let's see ambience resolution high okay i want it oh i want the hd quality also like that it's all hand drawn too that's what you know also they do have a kickstart i don't know if it's funding is still going on

160
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:39,100
yeah the art looks great i want to play alice's dead again but it was made in flash so i don't even know if like it still exists or anything

161
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:54,210
get up okay don't tell me what to do you're not my mom

162
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:36,930
oh my head goodness did i fall from all the way up here that's got to be at least 100 meters a thousand actually how am i not dead maybe i shouldn't i put it on high this is like how am i lagging this is 2d oh i've landed on a tea table it must have broken my fall How peculiar!

163
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,190
It is an odd place to have tea though, isn't it?

164
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,530
At the bottom of a hole?

165
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,790
It's quite strange.

166
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,690
Oh, good god.

167
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,710
My head!

168
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,490
I think I must have bashed it on the way down.

169
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,910
I can't seem to remember how I got here.

170
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:04,370
Well, usually when I can't remember how I arrived somewhere, it's because I am dreaming.

171
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:32,420
so you must be dreaming again oh i know you're dreaming again alice though usually i wake up before i hit the ground i never struck around after speaking of alice the only good thing i like about the tim burns alice in wonderland movie is that they brought back avriel levine like i actually i love her song alice

172
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,320
i love that song that's actually in my phone right um It's on my...

173
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,580
I actually bought the album just for Averell Levine.

174
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,420
Fun shop.

175
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,440
Thank you for the super chat.

176
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:44,780
Thank you.

177
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,420
Thank you.

178
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,540
Alice's Dead has a Steam version.

179
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,440
It does.

180
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,100
It's coming on 2026.

181
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,780
Also, I'm a huge fan of Twisted Fairy Tales.

182
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,920
And Habromania and the animatics are so fantastic.

183
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,860
Thank you for the super chat.

184
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,120
Thank you.

185
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,580
Thank you.

186
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,800
Wait, really?

187
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,460
Oh my God.

188
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,460
I'm so excited.

189
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,780
I'm so excited for that.

190
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,660
Like I said, I've always loved the Alice's Dead game series.

191
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,080
series.

192
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,580
It was so interesting.

193
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,680
The art style and the story itself.

194
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,820
I guess I should try to wake up.

195
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Slap myself.

196
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,780
No, I feel like pinching does more because you don't actually slap yourself hard.

197
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,000
Hmm, well, that didn't work.

198
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,500
I suppose I should try again harder.

199
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,220
Pinch harder.

200
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,100
That's right.

201
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,040
Hurt yourself.

202
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,900
Ouch, Ouch, ouch.

203
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,940
It's not working.

204
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,320
Oh, dear.

205
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm not dreaming, am I?

206
00:33:38,920 --> 00:34:38,020
how did I get how did I get here and where is here how am I still alive after such a very long fall never accept reality oh Alice your head is just full of questions isn't it come on now let's try and unravel this I suppose the first thing I should find out is where am I I do remember how to walk at least let's on such wobbly knees okay maybe oh that's the inventory chapter one in the fall all right maybe oh wait i can't do oh there you go okay i will say i like that oh oh tarot cards with ancient pages deaf and the human i it is very creative but also i do not like the font for the settings because I got so confused.

207
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,600
Okay, maybe not high.

208
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,560
Maybe I isn't it.

209
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,940
Because I'm like lagging.

210
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,680
Okay, there we go.

211
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,420
I was like lagging a little bit.

212
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,240
All right.

213
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,340
What an odd place for a table.

214
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,880
I wonder who set this up.

215
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,520
You know what this reminds me of?

216
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
This gameplay reminds me of...

217
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,620
Was it Fran?

218
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,980
Um, the one where she's like...

219
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,620
Hello, little...

220
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,200
Hello, Dad.

221
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,260
Um, I think that's right.

222
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,540
The clock must be broken.

223
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:05,700
Awesome.

224
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,440
Who put a clock on the wall of a cable?

225
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,460
What was the game?

226
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,440
Yeah, Frambeau?

227
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,920
That's what it reminds me of right now.

228
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,200
I think I see some light peeking through here.

229
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,760
Yeah, the little girl.

230
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,960
Hello.

231
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,840
I'll shred myself to ribbons if I try to climb through all the thorns.

232
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,040
Okay, I guess we go left side.

233
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,120
So we can't go anywhere here.

234
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,640
Oh, no.

235
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,540
What can we do?

236
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:48,940
I know, but I'm just stuck.

237
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,700
Oh, wait, there's this.

238
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,320
What's under here?

239
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,500
What is under here?

240
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,500
Oh, wait, there's scissors.

241
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,560
Oh, what a pretty pair of scissors.

242
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,060
I should like to keep them, I think.

243
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,300
The fact that all of this is hand-drawn is insane.

244
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,080
That's so much work.

245
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,340
I cut the thorns.

246
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,060
My shiny pair of scissors shouldn't make quick work of this.

247
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,960
There we are.

248
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,300
Nicely done.

249
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,580
Snip, snip.

250
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,380
Yeah, her walk.

251
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,280
She's, like, shredding.

252
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,860
You know what this reminds me of?

253
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:35,200
That, um, the Russian walk song where it's, like, like, the three guys shredding along.

254
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,680
That one's in Ryan's...

255
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,140
Yeah, the power walk, yeah.

256
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,540
Pretty prickly little thing, aren't you?

257
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,740
Yeah, the lives...

258
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,860
Yeah, the lives he walk?

259
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,640
Yeah, that one's in Ryan's ear.

260
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,160
She's got confidence.

261
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,240
She got style.

262
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,980
Goodness, it's a...

263
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,540
It's a skeleton.

264
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,020
Oh, what's in there?

265
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,380
Is that a spider?

266
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:23,140
well that's the most horrifying thing i've ever seen oh dear i don't do well with dead bodies i'm afraid poor skeleton what happened to you did you get stuck here as well you certainly look like you've been down here for a while i suppose that doesn't promote very well for me

267
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:37,820
drat this way is blocked i could try scaling it maybe though in this dress and considering my I'm not sure that'll get me anywhere.

268
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,760
Is there anything else around here?

269
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,520
Oh, he has a bag.

270
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,520
Is this your bag, Mr. Skeleton?

271
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,120
Or Miss Skeleton?

272
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,320
I can say out of way, I suppose.

273
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
I should quite like to take a peek inside your bag if you don't mind.

274
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,600
Yorke's dead.

275
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,900
It's a book.

276
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,060
No, a journal.

277
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,920
Oh, were you a writer?

278
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm a bit snoopy, I'm afraid.

279
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,400
I might give it a read.

280
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
No one will know him.

281
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
He's dead anyway.

282
00:38:05,420 --> 00:39:06,600
empty journal journals are meant to be written in if you won't use it i will i can use this to keep my head on strike keep things sorted and organized oh i do hope i remember things soon worst case if someone finds my skeleton here they'll at least know who i knew i was remember my head hurts remember your past what could i use this journal for him oh she's an artist oh that's cute if you're reading this i might it's a good thing i can read cursive i might be dead in the bottom of a hole and you found this near my decaying corpse if so hello my name is alice i'm 19 years old and that's just about all i can remember about myself at the moment i've fallen quite a long way down and i think i must have hit my head pretty handwriting of course she's british hopefully she's a rich british girl too hopefully no important bits are damaged aside from the whole memory thing which i suppose is an important bit but i can worry about After I got it out of here,

283
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,820
whatever here is.

284
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,720
Okay.

285
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,460
Oh, I can overwrite it.

286
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,460
Okay.

287
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,700
There's a Cheshaw cat.

288
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,200
Hello, cat.

289
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,100
Whoa.

290
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,140
Cat?

291
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,620
Oh, thank you, cat.

292
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,700
What was that?

293
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,080
Let me grab this.

294
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,560
Yoink.

295
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,180
That's a bit sad seeing as you're dead.

296
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,000
Your ring is very shiny, still.

297
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,720
Sicky fingers, Alice.

298
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,620
No, but, yeah, see?

299
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,100
That's right, girl.

300
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,560
It's okay if they're dead.

301
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,660
What is he gonna do?

302
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,820
What is he gonna do with the ring, guys?

303
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,540
If anything, I'm giving it life again.

304
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,360
Instead of letting it rot.

305
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,920
If this necklace's real, it must be ridiculous, expensive.

306
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,340
Yoink, my necklace now.

307
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,460
She's very beautiful and very nude.

308
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,340
Ha ha ha.

309
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,840
That's a bit ironic, isn't it?

310
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,860
What?

311
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,800
Oh, oh, it's because she's Medusa.

312
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,260
And she's, like, stone right now.

313
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,140
What a pretty young lady.

314
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,840
And what pretty flowers.

315
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,860
Lady Justice.

316
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,460
I hate to be the business end of the axe.

317
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,720
Why do they always make old people look so unpleasant?

318
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,740
I've always found old women delightful.

319
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,220
Oh, wait, what's this?

320
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,240
It's a photograph of a fountain.

321
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:39,840
Hmm?

322
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,060
Where is this?

323
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,170
Oh, okay.

324
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,130
So I have to find the statue.

325
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:48,890
What the fuck?

326
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,330
Why are the rats down there?

327
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,850
Okay, so maybe I have to find that statue?

328
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,870
Can I go more here?

329
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,190
Oh, I can.

330
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:58,970
Oh.

331
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,710
Yeah, hag love.

332
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,810
I wonder if I have a mother.

333
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,210
Well, obviously I know how to have a mother.

334
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,770
Everyone has a mother.

335
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,610
I mean, in a specific sense.

336
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,690
I can't remember.

337
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:10,810
Oh, look.

338
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,910
That's a nipple.

339
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,570
But you guys, oh, it's right here.

340
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,950
I hope you two.

341
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:20,710
It's okay.

342
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,230
I saw other people playing Habermania, and so I'm sure it'd be fine.

343
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,550
Censor that.

344
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,190
Okay.

345
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,610
So I have to, I think I just have to give the knife to Medusa, and I'll open the door.

346
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,390
There too.

347
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,250
I'm like a 14-year-old boy.

348
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,530
Oh, yoink, mine now.

349
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,650
This is the kind of basket I used to go picnicking with.

350
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,530
Yoink, mine now.

351
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,290
Yoink.

352
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,030
Wait, that's as close as I can get.

353
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,810
What do you mean?

354
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,630
I might not have anything else?

355
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,430
Oh, look at all these items I found.

356
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,270
I'm going to suspiciously shatter for being off the corpse.

357
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,270
See, till death do us part.

358
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,870
He's dead.

359
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,050
He doesn't need it anymore.

360
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,530
There's a stream of light coming from above.

361
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,030
It looks like a way out.

362
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,030
Now if I could just figure out how to get up there.

363
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,020
Oh, is that a gap?

364
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,860
Oh, shit.

365
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,320
Okay.

366
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,940
Well, I could just jump over that.

367
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,200
That can't be too.

368
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,600
Oh, no.

369
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,280
It's pretty far.

370
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:26,780
Never mind.

371
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,720
It's some sort of bucket water elevator system.

372
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,420
It's not moving, though, obviously.

373
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,400
I didn't see the whole gamers don't look up down or up.

374
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay.

375
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,120
Okay, we can't do anything.

376
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,600
Oh, it's covered in thorns?

377
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,880
I don't know what to do.

378
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:44,920
Snip, snip.

379
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,420
There you go.

380
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,100
Alright, up you go, little guy.

381
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:51,580
What?

382
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,320
I thought I could make it work.

383
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,720
Yeah, me too.

384
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,520
I thought so, too.

385
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,020
Oh, is that the cat?

386
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,120
Cat!

387
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,240
Is that you?

388
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,760
Mercy, that's not a rubble.

389
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,080
I could get crushed.

390
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,240
What a miserable looking clown.

391
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:46,460

Oh, what a pretty handheld mirror.

394
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,320
Gosh, my reflection sure looks worse for wear.

395
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,880
Cheer him up, Mirror Alex.

396
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:22,800
We'll get through this.

397
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,360
Yoink, my mirror now.

398
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,900
Anything in here?

399
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:28,940
Is this where...

400
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,380
Oh, hello there, little rat.

401
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,920
Oh, he dropped the coin.

402
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,380
It's hard-earned money.

403
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,140
My hard-earned money.

404
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,140
Was that rat wearing clothes or am I mad?

405
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,300
We're all mad here, Alice.

406
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,440
Let's go down.

407
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:48,910
Let's go.

408
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,070
How come the rat wears clothes, but the crow doesn't?

409
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,770
Our horn earned money now.

410
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,850
Not that money would do me any good here, but it surely is.

411
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,150
Wait, would the crow want my money?

412
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,230
The crow, I earned this for you.

413
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,790
Obviously, a shiny coin won't be...

414
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,750
I don't fucking know.

415
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,930
Crows like shiny things.

416
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,910
Don't kink shame the crow.

417
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,910
There's nothing else here then.

418
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,610
I don't know who was more frightened.

419
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,590
Me or the rat.

420
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,650
No, I found it fair and square.

421
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,330
He dropped.

422
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,570
He could have came back for it, but he didn't.

423
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,290
Poor dolly.

424
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,130
Down here all by yourself.

425
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,030
Where's your mama, baby?

426
00:45:47,650 --> 00:46:17,270
unpleasant you want this baby how about this baby that didn't work let's put the baby doll away oh what about the basket there's like twigs in it would you consider moving your nest into this wicker basket instead of that pitcher oh there were branches in there but isn't convinced you'll have to sweeten the deal yes i know it's a bit drab i suppose i could dress it up for you The raven is unreadable.

427
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,050
I'll take that as a yes.

428
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:21,550
How the fuck do I?

429
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,870
Oh, I can combine it.

430
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,050
Can I combine that?

431
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,350
Oh, I did.

432
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,070
Oh, I'm making it shiny.

433
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:31,730
Here.

434
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,410
I put a nice shiny thing on it.

435
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,330
But is it moving?

436
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,310
Oh my god, you're so greedy.

437
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,810
What the fuck are you gonna...

438
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,250
Your old nest wasn't even shiny anyway.

439
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,190
All right.

440
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,170
How about this?

441
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:48,670
Now it has a neck.

442
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,330
Now it has bling on it.

443
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:51,910
Is this alright?

444
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,610
But it isn't moving.

445
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,810
I think give you the ring too?

446
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,830
What the fuck won't you?

447
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,550
You steal shit then for your fucking nest.

448
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:01,930
Okay.

449
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:05,030
Here you go.

450
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:06,690
His greed.

451
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,410
Her greed sickens me.

452
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,250
That should be enough, I think.

453
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,850
I put a lot of nice shiny things on it.

454
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:19,070
If I were a bird, I sure like to live in a nest like this.

455
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,790
Like, what happened to your old nest?

456
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,830
Your old nest had, like, you could just transfer your fucking old nest here.

457
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,270
Oh, for me?

458
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,210
A feather.

459
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,730
Wow.

460
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,350
Thank you very much, Miss Raven.

461
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,130
It's like she gave me a lock of her hair.

462
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:38,270
Which is definitely not.

463
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,210
Oh, wait, never mind.

464
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,890
Is there, like, one strand of her hair?

465
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,330
And be like, thank you for this $500,000 net.

466
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,630
Here's a strand of my hair.

467
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,030
A picture.

468
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,090
I wonder where I can use it.

469
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:53,530
Okay.

470
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,050
So it's one of the...

471
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,010
I assume it's the Medusa statue?

472
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,370
Because she was holding...

473
00:47:59,370 --> 00:47:59,770
something.

474
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,290
The art of the deal.

475
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,810
I think the crow was a better negotiator than me.

476
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,830
I was gonna say I'm a child, but then this Alice is actually 19, so I'm just fucking stupid, I guess.

477
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,950
Or her, maybe?

478
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:23,310
yeah I think it's her wait it's not it looked like she was supposed to carry it

479
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:46,350
who would be the one that carries it young adults windowed by local bird I thought it was her she looked like she could carry it from with that hand but I guess not.

480
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:48,290
What?

481
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,520
I don't know where the fuck that statue is.

482
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, wait.

483
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,600
There are snakes.

484
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,920
I just noticed the snakes.

485
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,320
There you go.

486
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,340
There she is.

487
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,300
You're free now.

488
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,650
We all...

489
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,350
We all, guys, it was...

490
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,650
We all know she was dead before we got here, right?

491
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,830
The statue had no head when I got here, guys.

492
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:51,810
Well, getting her head cut off is a trophy thing, I mean.

493
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,070
Guys, guys, it wasn't me.

494
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,770
Guys, it wasn't me.

495
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,650
It could have been anyone else, but it wasn't me.

496
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:03,430
They'll give it to him.

497
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:05,450
I assume.

498
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,630
Aw, but he's headless.

499
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,620
No head?

500
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,200
She had no head when I got here, guys.

501
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,680
What the fuck do I do with this?

502
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,880
Statue head.

503
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,430
I don't know where to put this.

504
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:29,110
Justice?

505
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,680
It could have been any one of us!

506
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,960
You have no proof it was me!

507
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,780
That's the title's new...

508
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,920
Is it the moon cycle?

509
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,720
It's this one.

510
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,960
But, like, I don't know what to give her.

511
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,120
Maybe a rose?

512
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,680
They're a pretty flower or a pretty statue.

513
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,780
I knew it.

514
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,060
Okay.

515
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,540
So I got one of the symbols to start glowing.

516
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,380
Oh, okay.

517
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,260
What would the old lady want?

518
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,200
A feather?

519
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,460
What would she want?

520
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,460
Oh, food here.

521
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:22,680
Alright.

522
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,260
What does the old...

523
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,220
Oh, I feel like it's the apple, but I can't get across.

524
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,280
It has to be the apple, right?

525
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,520
Yeah, because she's like the...

526
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:33,920
The...

527
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,840
What was it called?

528
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,020
The crazy old lady from Snow White.

529
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,420
Not the wicked witch.

530
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,160
That's from Wizard of Oz.

531
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,140
I don't remember what it was called.

532
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,300
Okay, what would she want?

533
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,900
Would you want a baby?

534
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,400
Oh, here you go, Miss Statue.

535
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,840
I found a baby for you.

536
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,040
You want a trash baby?

537
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,640
The Evil Queen.

538
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,620
Yeah, but she had a name when she turned into the old lady.

539
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,100
It's, you know what?

540
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,880
There's another one.

541
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,940
Only one symbol left, and then, well...

542
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,900
I actually don't know exactly what this is doing.

543
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,680
But it's doing something, and that's better than nothing, I suppose.

544
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:16,840
Here you go.

545
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,520
Here's a trash baby.

546
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,680
Was it the crone?

547
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,660
How the fuck do I get the apple?

548
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,100
How do I get across?

549
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,640
Instruction's unclear.

550
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,540
Yeah, I can't make this move.

551
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,060
Oh, wait.

552
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,340
There's a vine that I could grab.

553
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,020
Yeah.

554
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,840
Garden hose on a headless snake.

555
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,860
Oh, wait, what?

556
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,080
I can bind this.

557
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:53,600
Oh!

558
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,940
And I can use this to grab the apple.

559
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,460
Wait, okay, never mind.

560
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,740
Let's put this fake snake away.

561
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,800
Never mind.

562
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,340
Apparently I can't use it.

563
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,480
Huh.

564
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,560
What can I do with a fake snake?

565
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,770
There's nothing I can do here.

566
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,510
I thought I could use it as a grapple.

567
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,230
Maybe like...

568
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,610
As I'm looking.

569
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,070
I'm looking as hard as I can look.

570
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,520
What the fuck do I...

571
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,040
Does the old lady want a fake snake?

572
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,520
I would assume like the old lady would want a...

573
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,060
Yeah, let's see.

574
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,860
Why would I use a fake snake here?

575
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,540
It's very beautiful and very nude.

576
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,620
I'm so... I don't know.

577
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,100
I don't know what statue would mean a fake-ass snake.

578
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,660
Does the headless want a snake?

579
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,500
I already... I thought I already finished her job.

580
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,500
Yeah, see?

581
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,200
Don't be daft.

582
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,800
The fake snake won't work here.

583
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,670
Wait, can I, like, scare the...

584
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,990
Oh, maybe the headless guy?

585
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,750
He doesn't have a brain.

586
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,150
It didn't work.

587
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,230
Did I get everything on the other side?

588
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,290
Let me see if I missed anything.

589
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:51,030
No, I didn't miss anything.

590
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,230
That's weird.

591
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,490
What the fuck do I mean?

592
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,710
Yeah, I tried it on all these statues.

593
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:00,990
I tried it on her, too.

594
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,450
There's no other items.

595
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,390
What am I supposed to do?

596
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,350
Spook the bird?

597
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:09,970
Because I want... I need to get to...

598
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:10,430
Yeah.

599
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,650
I was going to say, do I scare the bird or some shit?

600
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,450
Am I going to be that type of person?

601
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,630
I am that type of.

602
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,170
Oh, shit.

603
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:21,890
That's okay.

604
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:22,850
I didn't realize.

605
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,390
There was a plank here all along.

606
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,730
I thought it was like...

607
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,130
I don't know.

608
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,150
I thought it was part of the decoration.

609
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,090
There we go.

610
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,230
A bridge.

611
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,250
Very clever stuff.

612
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,630
I'm so clever, guys.

613
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,610
Now just try not to fall on it.

614
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,250
I'm not hungry, but this apple is too pretty to eat anyway.

615
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,350
God, I'm so goddamn clever, guys.

616
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,230
On me.

617
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,870
We have the apple.

618
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,030
Yeah, it blended into the background.

619
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,330
It didn't look like it was like something I picked up.

620
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,070
Would you like this apple, ma'am?

621
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:09,930
Yay!

622
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,270
The symbol is glowing now.

623
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,790
How very strange.

624
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,870
I did it.

625
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,530
Oh yeah, I'm British, so I'm used to taking everything without permission.

626
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:24,710
Hello, cat.

627
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,230
Oh, ma'am.

628
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,470
I got you your fucking vase or picture.

629
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,130
All right, go.

630
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,370
Is this what you need?

631
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,030
Oh.

632
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,390
That's not ominous at all.

633
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,910
Oh, would you look at that?

634
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,890
It's working again.

635
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,910
Where is the water coming from?

636
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:50,690
I wonder.

637
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,430
I suppose it's unimportant so long as it's working.

638
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,750
It's best not to think about things too hard sometimes.

639
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,550
All that water, because she can't keep any hold in her hand.

640
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,430
It all just slips through her fingers.

641
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,310
Just squeeze your fingers tighter.

642
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:11,210
Why is there holes in your finger you're trying to drink the water?

643
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:53,570
It gives me the heebie-jeebies, where heebie-jeebies are, it actually oh wait what's this a note is it say death and life were not enemies as the humans had always supposed just as there could be no warmth of day without the cool hand of night so too could there be no life without death life brought beginning mornings in light death brought ending sleep in peace and so it was for all time always and forever I love the soundtrack of this game It's just Gives a little bit of madness Like uneasiness,

644
00:57:53,770 --> 00:58:03,970
I guess I wonder where this water flows to I'm trying to fucking head over, Alice But I seem to be not able to move from this area

645
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,670
Maybe like Does it go this way?

646
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:22,940
Oh, it's flowing through like the lake just a little bit of like uneasiness to like this oh yeah we did it

647
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:49,260
i'm gonna yoy you little man that's right oh oh okay i can ride the bucket mill yes i was gonna like fucking grab him magister thank you for the super chat thank you thank you love you turkey oh dear this isn't the surface is it i'm still underground oh it doesn't look like we're in Kansas.

648
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,780
Where is this place?

649
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,940
It looks nothing like the ruins from before.

650
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,820
Is that a house?

651
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,480
There's a car here.

652
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,740
Is this like a garbage pit?

653
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,180
Is anyone home, I wonder?

654
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,520
It's locked.

655
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,180
Knock, knock.

656
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,780
Hello, is somebody there?

657
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,740
I guess nobody's home.

658
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,780
Knock louder.

659
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,060
Let them know you're here.

660
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,640
Hello, anyone?

661
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,700
I've been in trouble, I think, if anyone is Here, hello, bang on that door, Alice.

662
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,340
Anyone kick that door open?

663
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,640
You have rights.

664
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,840
I don't think I should even bother.

665
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,860
I'm rather weak, unfortunately.

666
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:32,980
Coward.

667
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,980
You gotta show Wonderland whose boss?

668
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,720
Assert your dominance, exactly.

669
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,960
Break the window.

670
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,640
I don't like this painting much.

671
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,580
Oh, another note.

672
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,380
What's this?

673
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,240
A bit ominous.

674
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,380
FBI open up.

675
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:10,260
Life sowed the seeds of the living, and when the time came, death harvested, he craved cleaved their souls from their flesh and blood and teeth, and brought them to the after.

676
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,580
He will leave them there because their souls did not belong to them.

677
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,480
Death did not belong to anyone or anywhere, and no one and nothing belonged.

678
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,040
to him.

679
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,340
All deaf knew was taken.

680
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,940
There's so much taking to be done.

681
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:30,500
Are these my parents?

682
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,660
She doesn't look very happy.

683
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,920
They're very attractive couple.

684
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,040
Oh?

685
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:38,920
Oh, there's a book.

686
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,440
The complete works of Edgar Allan Poe.

687
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,140
Hmm.

688
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,960
What a sad poem.

689
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,630
That's me!

690
01:00:49,110 --> 01:01:23,210
Be that word, our sign of painting bird parting bird are freeing i streaked go thee back into the tempest and the knights okay it's just agar allen poem you guys all know this poem nevermore okay i don't think there's anything else here uh broken bond thank you magenta super thank you thank you it's oh a fucking course is nevermore it's always nevermore That's cute.

691
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,750
I'm pretty sure he's like written like other stuff, but we'll almost just remember the Raven poem.

692
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,390
Here's an idea for the next playthrough after Batman.

693
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,630
Halo 2 is the easiest Halo deuce.

694
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,970
I shall only take about two to three streams to finish.

695
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,930
It'll also be funny since one of the skulls, it's really funny.

696
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,850
Thank you for the jump to super.

697
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:43,370
Thank you.

698
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,450
Thank you.

699
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:45,990
I was thinking about what playthrough.

700
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:50,490
It really depends on how I feel after like a playthrough on like what I want to do next afterwards.

701
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:51,670
But yeah, thank you.

702
01:01:51,950 --> 01:02:17,870
I'll think about um we'll see how it goes after Batman what else can I do here oh there's a key oh it's someone's key oh hey I found that key first I'm here for the I'm here representing the British Museum I hate that quite a lot God help me what am I supposed to do he just took it

703
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:22,680
Oh.

704
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,140
Wait, the music changed.

705
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,320
Do you guys notice that?

706
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,460
Oh!

707
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,400
It got a little slower.

708
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,120
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

709
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,250
I actually don't know what to do here.

710
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,850
Am I supposed to combine this?

711
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:48,290
No?

712
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,000
Hmm.

713
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,940
Wait, did the creepy rabbit have the key?

714
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,140
I wasn't looking at the painting.

715
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,700
Oh, you had to be super observant.

716
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,220
Oh, he did!

717
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,040
That's the key.

718
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,020
He didn't have that before, did he?

719
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,000
Oh, I don't like that.

720
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,800
I actually had goosebumps, the fact that the rabbit took the key.

721
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,900
How did I even... Well, in any case, I can have the key now.

722
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:23,940
Alright.

723
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,480
Is that nice of him?

724
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,580
He helped me bring the key closer.

725
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:29,840
I guess.

726
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,500
He was trying to be helpful, right?

727
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,160
Yeah, it was pretty unsettling.

728
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,060
Oh, butterfingers.

729
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,640
Let's try this again.

730
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,040
Oh.

731
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:45,700
Oh.

732
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,820
Oh, is that the Cheshire cat?

733
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,200
Hello.

734
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,120
Hello.

735
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,200
Hello.

736
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,220
You look a bit lost.

737
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,700
Jeez.

738
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:21,840
I was not expecting that that line from Alice Jesus Christ a talking cat I mean to be I would to be Alice I would react the same to if a rat suddenly decided to fucking talk to me He's like I'm a proper British girl Jesus Christ a fucking talking cat

739
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:33,720
Jesus Christ a talking girl That's a bit rude of a greeting don't you think?

740
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,240
I It's like, oh, they find...

741
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,680
A talking cat, Alice said calmly.

742
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,100
Goodness, we're on Earth, did you?

743
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,580
My God, you're a talking cat.

744
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,840
I believe that's been well established, yes?

745
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,820
Jesus, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary.

746
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,220
You're...

747
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,820
Are you some sort of...

748
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,040
Some sort of radio toy or something?

749
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,140
Aren't these the only options?

750
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,140
Radio toy or something?

751
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:58,440
something huh in that case i suppose i would be a something yeah she's like sorry i'm half hours oh my gosh now you've done it alice you've hit your head and now you're talking to cats just like aunt edith no not aunt edith the fucking crazy cat lady your aunt edith is a cat oh sorry no i mean she talks to cats but she's loony and so am i i guess ever since we took her to the hospital and you know got the ice pick in there hasn't been the same mr cat can you help me so you seem shocked certainly you've seen a cat before not a talking one oh yes of course but not well i can't say i've heard one speak Really?

752
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,680
I found most cats quite verbose.

753
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,820
Mimi, you just don't want to talk to you.

754
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,600
Well, they meow at me, but I obviously don't understand them.

755
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,060
But you speak English.

756
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,820
I'm also fluent in German.

757
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,900
Oh, because it's like...

758
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,240
They're like talking about the grim tales, right?

759
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:22,960
Um, okay.

760
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,820
I think I might be hallucinating.

761
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,220
I hit my head.

762
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,760
Oh, it might be a concussion.

763
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:30,900
Yes, I saw.

764
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,860
That was quite the fall.

765
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,760
And nobody's fallen down here in the wild.

766
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:38,360
You saw?

767
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,700
Have you been watching me?

768
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,480
Oh, sure.

769
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,620
You're quite clever, Alice.

770
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,160
Getting that fountain working again.

771
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:54,120
The last one just fiddled with those statues for a while and then gave up.

772
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,920
Well, I...

773
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,500
Wait, sorry.

774
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:23,880

775
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:30,760

776
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:36,580
I'm terribly confused, sir Well then, oh, which is it?

777
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:45,340

779
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,100
Sorry, I hope this isn't rude, but I'm not asking what it is not.

780
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,100
I mean, I mean, what is this place?

781
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,800
Does it mean a name?

782
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,860
Yeah, so I can look it up on Google Maps or some shit.

783
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,060
That's a different place than you used to be.

784
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,920
A place where both happen to be at the moment.

785
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,660
Yeah, he's rage baiting.

786
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,180
I'm fucking getting my food if he's gonna rage bait me.

787
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:45,960
Give me a sec.

788
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,300
It's outside my door.

789
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,020
All right.

790
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,560
Just tell me where I am.

791
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,760
How did I get back to where I used to be?

792
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,780
The opposite of how you fell in, I should think.

793
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,320
Though it's usually a one-way trip.

794
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,240
See, that's the issue.

795
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,220
I can't remember anything from before.

796
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,080
I mean, I remember a few things.

797
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,880
Like, books and basic arithmetic.

798
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,340
And how to speak English, of course.

799
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:30,640
Like, what?

800
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,440
Is that math?

801
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,320
You fucking remember.

802
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:32,900
math?

803
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,860
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

804
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:40,360
Like, you don't remember your mom, but you remember basic arithmetic?

805
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:43,720
Bro.

806
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,380
Okay, there's a lot.

807
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,860
That concussion is a little bit too bad.

808
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,060
Oh, they didn't give me a fork!

809
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,020
Again!

810
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,760
How am I gonna eat my jolly spaghetti?

811
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:00,960
Alright.

812
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,780
She remembers me.

813
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:59,220
man let's go but all the helpful memories are just gone i don't know how i fell in i just remember waking up does that sort of thing usually happen to you forgetting things i mean how should i know if i usually forget things when i can't remember who i am okay but i know i'm an atlas and i know how what one plus one is whoa you're Alice well obviously but look do you know the way out of here or not sure it's in the house really well all right may I have the key back then I shouldn't think so no no why not does it belong to you I found it and then I accidentally dropped on the way over.

814
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,460
And then I found it.

815
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,500
So by your own very flimsy ethics, it's mine now, isn't it?

816
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,080
No, I found it first.

817
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:14,280
It's quite possible any number of people found the key before you did.

818
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,800
That didn't deter you from taking it.

819
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,500
Look, Mr. Cat!

820
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,440
I just really need to get out of here.

821
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:25,660
Can I please?

822
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,440
Please have the key.

823
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,280
Finders, keepers, and destroyed by facts and logic.

824
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,680
I am having an argument of a cat right now.

825
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,640
There's no facts or logic to this.

826
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:37,360
No.

827
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,600
Wait, that's it?

828
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,300
He just fucking says no?

829
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,540
I just need to get in.

830
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,180
No.

831
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,720
There's nothing behind that door for you yet.

832
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,920
But you just said that's the way out.

833
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,940
Yes, but not for you.

834
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:54,880
Not yet.

835
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,080
See, this is just a demo and the house and everything.

836
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,680
Everything after is all content that's not ready for you yet.

837
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,320
That's, there's early stuff, access stuff in there.

838
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,400
Early access, what are you?

839
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,900
Well, this is the demo.

840
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,460
It's only the first little bit of your story.

841
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,500
If you like to experience the rest, you'll have to wait for the next bit to be up.

842
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,920
So that's up to you.

843
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,200
Up to me.

844
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,680
What do you mean?

845
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,440
You want the rest of the game?

846
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,340
You can check out the Kickstarter.

847
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,480
currently up.

848
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,420
That's where you can gain access to the rest of the game as it's developed and released.

849
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,720
Oh my god, sir.

850
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,380
A Kickstarter?

851
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,000
And what would a Kickstarter be, Cat?

852
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,140
Yes, it's where they're hoping to get funded for a full game production.

853
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,500
You can find, oh, tell, wait, tell me more.

854
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,820
Can you tell me more about the Kickstarter?

855
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,880
How much story is left?

856
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,080
How much story is left for you?

857
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:30,600
10 out of 10 shilshire cap oh quite a lot this is only the first half of the first chapter and they're planning for 12 12 whole chapters and four endings the planning oh i must have been heading towards um the bad ending because of all the stuff i've been stealing 12 chapters and how will those come out one at a time and all at once Is it gonna be episodic cat?

858
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:39,100
The story will be divided into three acts with each act containing four chapters plus the different endings in the last act?

859
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,640
Quite right.

860
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,080
Oh my god.

861
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,220
About that Kickstarter.

862
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:47,020
So where do I follow the development?

863
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:53,240
How do I see updated on what's going on?

864
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:57,940
The Steam page and Kickstarter are a good starting point, but you can follow the creator.

There's no way.

868
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,640
Like, I fucking talked for, like, 40 minutes before I started the game.

869
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,580
How the fuck did it take?

870
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,880
Did people just not look?

871
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,780
Like, did they just not look around?

872
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,180
How were they stuck on this game?

873
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,380
Wait, ask him for the key?

874
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,020
Oh, I could.

875
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,100

876
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,040
Can I please have the key card, please?

877
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,180
How about this?

878
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,060
When we get to the real thing, I'll give it to you myself.

879
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,680
I'd really rather just have it now.

880
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,540
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

881
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,580
So, can you give it to me?

882
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:33,960
No.

883
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:34,720
Please?

884
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,240
No.

885
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,380
Pretty, pretty, no.

886
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,760
Pretty, pretty, no.

887
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:43,060
I suppose if it's the only way to quell your insisting pestering, I can give it to you.

888
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:43,480
Really?

889
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,820
Thank you, Mr. Cap.

890
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:45,740
Be aware.

891
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,120
You may not encounter what you expect.

892
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,200
Alright, what's in here?

893
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:57,280

894
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:57,880
Alright.

I think it's coming out next year, right?

898
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,100
Or is it?

899
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,980
It seems very interesting so far.

900
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,920
And it's a very, like, tiny studio.

901
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,380
It's coming up next year, right?

902
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:15,260

I might back it, honestly.

906
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,740
It depends on the rewards.

907
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,720
Honestly, I hope it does have really nice rewards.

908
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,540

Since it's been, I think, and the soundtrack.

But anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

956
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,880
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve it.
