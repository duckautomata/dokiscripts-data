It's been three years.

6
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,520
I, I can't believe Nika has been around for, um, Goddess of Victory Nika has been around for like three years now.

7
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,980
I feel like, I don't know.

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,980
I've been there since the very beginning till now.

9
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,020

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,800
No.

19
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,520
It's not.

20
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,460
You cannot win.

21
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,340

22
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,500
Dad.

23
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,080
Okay.

24
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,040
So, I'm gonna want to support the stream.

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Please feel free to click the link pinned in chat or in the description below.

26
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,040
It really does help the stream out a lot.

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
But yes, again, a huge thank you to Niki.

28
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:51,000
um for the sponsor by the way uh like i said i will be showing a pre-recorded video um that was made uh for today's uh third year anniversary they basically invited me and a couple of other vtubers and to do a little something special in the i chat oh my god he left my room and then but he started shouting um in the kitchen um oh yes i was actually i think it was like Me and Snuffy were recruited two days before the sponsor.

29
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,440
So, like, okay, so I'll tell you guys, I'll tell you guys a story while we're watching it.

30
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,540
We will pause the video.

31
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,380
I was debating if I wanted to, like, go let the video play throughout it.

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,820
Or we'll pause, like, if I do, like, actual pure react, like, what's it called?

33
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,600
Like, reactionary content where I pause, like, try to make it more.

34
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,580
What's the word when you're trying to make it more your own content?

35
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:45,080
pause and uh start like talking about it like to make it more transformative i don't know if i should pause and talk about it to make it more transformative or we like just watch it all the way to the end so you guys don't get like out like like you know get taken out of um immersion or stuff we'll figure it out i don't know maybe i'll pause the video at some points because all of us are watching it at the same time i'm pretty sure they're already starting the video so i'm a behind already.

36
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,280
But yes, now you guys know why last week I was all over the place.

37
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,260
And I was all over the place.

38
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:05,200
And I was like so tired last week because it was like, I had two days to prep for this stream, this recording.

39
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,200
Two days, guys.

40
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,160
Because they're like, oh, we had some VTBs dropout.

41
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,880
Doki and stuff, you'll be able to do it.

42
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,920
And then at first, I was like, I don't know, two days.

43
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,580
And like, I don't have my VR stuff set up.

44
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,180
And then they were like, okay, but what if like you get paid this much?

45
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,900
I was like, let's do it.

46
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,040
I was like, what was that?

47
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,780
Yeah, of course.

48
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm down.

49
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm so down.

50
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,540
Yeah, I'm ready to do it.

51
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,980
I was like, sign me up.

52
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Two days, that's nothing.

53
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,700
I can get all that set up so fast.

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah.

55
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,740
But I will tell you guys the story of how fucked up it was for me to prep for this stream.

56
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,320
But first off, let's just grab, let's get the video going.

57
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm going to make sure I don't accidentally play the wrong video.

58
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,820
I need to make sure this is the right video.

59
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:42,060
wait give me a sec okay it's this one um all right sound guy i hope you're you guys help can help me adjust my sound you can type in chat all right if it's too loud let me know whoa by the way i am blind reacting to this so oh wait this is too big so i haven't seen the full edited version yet This is my very first time watching the full video.

60
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,900
Because they sent us the video literally like today, a couple of hours ago.

61
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,340
So this is my very first time watching how they edit everything together, how they piece it all together.

62
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,120
Can come, okay, video can, all right, there you go.

63
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,920
I lowered the volume a little bit down, yeah.

64
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,220
I assume this is related to the, it's like the third anniversary TV.

65
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,500
assume.

66
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,200
Spoilers.

67
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,880
Well, to be fair, I feel like new players wouldn't even know this spoilers.

68
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,620
Ha ha ha ha!

69
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,500
This is a spoiler!

70
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,220
It's a spoiler.

71
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,460
It looks like an anime intro.

72
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,720
Yes, I've lowered the volume sound gap.

73
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,240
Also, you can type in my chat.

74
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,660
You don't need to type in this one.

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,040
I know all these characters.

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,060
I've pulled for these guys before.

77
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:41,700
Also, you guys would not believe, like, which, by the way, I'll talk about when we're actually there, so when we get to the VR footage.

78
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
Hey, it's that girl.

79
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,040
Oh my god, it's that girl.

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,080
I know her.

81
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,200
I hate pulling for her in the game.

82
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,490
Name one character, Rapunzel.

83
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,110

She has really a big personality.

94
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,220
She has a very big personality.

95
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,840
That's what I can say about Rapunzel.

96
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,020

I guess these are like all the new stuff that you can get for the third anniversary.

105
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,060
There's new side story banner, there's new rewards.

They all do.

114
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,000
Alright, just while, um, this is not the actual, we didn't pre-record this, but it's not our gameplay.

115
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,020
I assume, like, later on, you'll know.

116
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,660
I know the Niki engineers are very good at physics.

117
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,260
Aw, she's cute, and get her for free, too.

118
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,150
Am I eating?

119
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,010
I got Denny's last night, um, not this morning.

120
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,950
I woke up at, like, 6 a.m., and I got...

121
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,690
Denny's.

122
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,670
I was like, mmm, do I do I feel like shit right now?

123
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,750
Mmm.

124
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,850

125
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,130
Man, do I feel particularly shit right now to get Denny's today?

126
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,890
Like, sorry to hear that.

127
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,570
Yeah.

128
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,250
Yeah, I hit a new low.

129
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,310
I did.

130
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,810
It's not Asia Denny's.

131
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,570
If it was Asia Denny's, then that's just a regular day.

132
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,210
But this was N.A.

133
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,190
Denny's.

134
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,850
But I like how quiet you are.

135
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,490
What the?

136
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,440
Ma'am.

137
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,360
This is a battlefield.

138
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,800
Ma'am.

139
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,080
This is...

140
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,780
What else?

141
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,020
Don't look at me.

142
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,980
Look at the enemy!

143
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,340
Ma'am, the enemy's in front of you.

144
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,900
Stop looking at me!

145
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,460
Oh.

146
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,080
Oh my god Who let this person into the battlefield?

147
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,280
Wow!

148
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,120
What is she even shooting at?

149
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,820
Downward die

150
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,970
Will thou be my guide?

151
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:41,180
I know you guys were not looking at her eyes chat Don't lie to me Don't fucking lie to me But it was the beginning and the end of fate's entwined.

152
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,740
I have long learned for the...

153
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Oh, it just has to be the new story of that recorded a third year anniversary.

154
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,940
But I was sounding...

155
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,580
I hope all the... I hope the sounds been good so far.

156
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,800
At last.

157
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,680
The hour I have long desired is finally upon us.

158
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,600
Also, like, how...

159
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,020
How would we even see your eyes?

160
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,540
Yes, she was looking at us, but we were definitely not looking at where her head was.

161
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,690
I know the stories for Nikkei is always like really good too

162
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:33,370
Who's this guy in my Nikkei story You're not Nikkei Get out of here Not with your regular weird tiny ass gun

163
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:43,610
That's me Get out of the battlefield Let the ladies do the fighting.

164
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,610
That's my...

165
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,970
Oh yeah, that's John Niche.

166
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,870
That's literally him.

167
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,310
Exactly!

168
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,450
What am I doing on the battlefield?

169
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,590
I should be sitting in my base right now.

170
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,390
I shouldn't be part of this fight.

171
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,070
I shouldn't be part of this fight.

172
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,830
I should be sitting in my base commanding my women to fight.

173
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:44,830
by strong-ass women everything's so loud again there was never this much noise when mother was still here it was gotta or a fire I need to put an end to this I can't come out of being out there with them weapon to my G like my Bluetooth why Why can't I just Bluetooth command them from home?

174
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,310
I must have a shitty ass signal.

175
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:57,770
I still haven't regained much of my strength, which means I'm going to need the human.

176
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,970
The battery died.

177
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,830
Yet, as with all things, not proceeds according to one's designs.

178
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:13,130
I ponder, is it too soon or just in time?

179
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,310
As ever, we may do not but our best.

180
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,130
Okay.

181
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,730
Yo-han, must I really explain to you how huge a deal it is that we've captured a heretic alone.

182
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,390
A heretic?

183
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,790
Who's that?

184
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,010
That's her?

185
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,130
Call the monk.

186
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,730
Oh, Nayuta?

187
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,350
Are we calling Nayuta?

188
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,710
See, I remember their names, guys.

189
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,530
Suddenly, there are an awful lot of jests in Eden.

190
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:47,590
Hmm.

191
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,610
So this is the monk you kept running into when I wasn't around.

192
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,270
The one who never dies or something.

193
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,010
Does thou say that this which lies before me is truly...

194
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,610
What?

195
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,590
Fix her.

196
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,810
But only...

197
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:12,310
don't fix her can we actually fix her though i have many questions we can fix her guys

198
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,600
oh we're updating the new story

199
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:39,970
oh my god wait is that the end the one we definitely the downward dog

200
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,980
See, I can recognize her.

201
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,660
Only from the back, though.

202
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,000
Only from the back, apparently.

203
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,080
Which wandereth beyond the firmament.

204
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,180
And ever do I envision it?

205
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,340
Whether in waking or in dream?

206
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,800
The hour wherein that the curse of light shall be snuffed out.

207
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,400
Okay, but we never saw her front, guys.

208
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,880
She never turned around, chat.

209
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,920
All I'm saying is that she never turned around.

210
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,960
So I recognized her costume from the back.

211
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,720
That's all I'm implying.

212
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,660
And her beautiful eyes, too.

213
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,940
Guys, you're right, you're right.

214
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,140
Also her beautiful eyes.

215
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,980
Oh, it is in 3D.

216
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:06,170
all right what was the color of her eyes oh wait she's never mind can't test you oh wait that that might be extinguished once and for all that's the queen

217
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:24,840
oh she's so op she can here's like i might just have her only her as the team come forth my revered goddesses of victory if she can make loans of herself Why does it even build a team?

218
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,680
Just have her.

219
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,540
Now is the hour to rage or all.

220
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,620
Alright, I ate my bread.

221
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,380
Sorry, I had to have a little snack.

222
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,720
A little snacky break.

223
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,730
Oh my gosh, she title dropped.

224
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,310
You're right.

225
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,330
Why is this?

226
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,890
This was also...

227
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,450
This is not part of the recording, by the way.

228
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,150
I've never seen any of this before.

229
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,830
So I'm like, whoa, what is this?

230
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,430
Oh, that's so cool!

231
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,290
That's crazy.

232
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,610
Wait, did he not do any pre-sketches?

233
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,210
I don't think there's like any pre- like he's doing it all like actual no sketching at all.

234
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,770
But that's amazing.

235
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,090
That's insane.

236
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,350
Especially with like ink too.

237
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,240
Yeah, this guy's really talented.

238
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,900
Hey, no!

239
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,200
No!

240
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,680
No, I already...

241
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,220
No!

242
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,900
No!

243
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,000
No!

244
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,140
No!

245
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,620
But the lard looks amazing.

246
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:49,840
I think it's crazy that he didn't even need to sketch anything to just paint all of that without any like, like, uh, without any plans.

247
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,040
Like, it was just all in his head.

248
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,740
That's insane.

249
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,580
It looks so good, too.

250
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,480
You have to have, like, really good control with your hand to, like, ink paintings.

251
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,700
Now is the time.

252
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,540
As long as my subjects need it, I can clear the goddess' squad.

253
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,640
Title drop.

254
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,840
There was a pre-sketch.

255
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,920
I still think that's still really good, even with the pre-sketch.

256
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,640
Oh, guys, free code!

257
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,360
If you use goddess assemble, you get free stuff.

258
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,680
We all love free stuff.

259
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,860
We are the free stuff.

260
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,610
When the sun, it sounds nice.

261
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,670
It's not sick.

262
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:22,370
The crimson path will be my guys.

263
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,250
Oh, when you're in the middle.

264
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,330
Oh, poor change.

265
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,410
I guess it's a different character.

266
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,270
So they changed the music.

267
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,170
Music tempo.

268
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,960
And they went all out for the third anniversary.

269
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,950
I mean, too unfair.

270
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,510
Oh, I wish I could spoil the video.

271
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:15,210
It's just for the sponsor alone for what they did for us like what we had to do for this sponsor alone They went all out for the third year anniversary And this song is oh shit look at tyrant

272
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,710
I can't spoil it yet.

273
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,470
I wish I could I'll spoil it the moment of the moment you guys see it I'll spoil it.

274
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,570
I'll explain everything It was like, yeah, they went all out.

275
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,290
They all, they fucking went all out.

276
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,410
Niki always makes like, oh, we got songs and stuff too for the events.

277
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,130
Which is very smart too.

278
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,210
They could literally do a concert they want to based off, I mean, they have, they have done concerts based off of Niki music.

279
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,770
It's very smart to do.

280
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:11,890
Yeah, you loop it on Spotify.

281
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,280
Yeah, there's a lot of

282
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,930
chapters too.

283
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,190
Like, I mean, it's three years.

284
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,130
What chapter are they on now?

285
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,470
I would assume they have like enough for an orchestra.

286
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,990
Like an orchestral, orchestra concert.

287
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,550
42 chapters, yeah.

288
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,390
And every time there's a new chapter, they have to use like new original music too.

289
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,550
Cause there's always a big update whenever there's a new chapter.

290
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,350
Liberalia seized Eden's sphere and fired it into the sky.

291
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,810
Oh my god, this is it.

292
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,410
Okay, yeah, okay, I can say it.

293
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,130
They built an entire VR, multiple VR chat worlds for this.

294
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,790
Like, I've been holding it for so long.

295
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,370
I was like, oh my god, I can finally talk about it.

296
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:36,070
Yeah, so you guys can see, they built multiple VR chat worlds for...

297
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,210
For this event that we had to do.

298
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,930
And we were allowed to see, like, off the bat, what they were doing.

299
00:25:46,950 --> 00:26:09,670
where like you know like all of it at once like they're like before the recording they're like all right we record this part and they're like all right next world and then so we got to experience it like as we go along and I would say I will warn you guys it was all one take as in like we do one kit take and then we're like all right next scene

300
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:51,770
yeah this is crazy this was all happening in the chat world by the way all of this was like in the vr chat world we didn't do pot in between takes like we'd be like all right pot cut and then next take and hey no oh there you go oh my gosh the whole ground is shaking what's happened oh it's actually impressive like she and i but you get to me i you know i was doing this one take

301
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,450
No, I can't do this alone.

302
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,450
I'm too weak against it.

303
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,270
I'm gonna need more help.

304
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,910
I need to assemble them.

305
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,670
Yes, she is assembling!

306
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,190
It's a kind of quiet.

307
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,070
I can raise it up.

308
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,430
Sound guide, try to raise it up.

309
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,390
I'm gonna raise it up anyway.

310
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,570
You can tell who can act and who couldn't.

311
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,610
As if you could tell that I was not...

312
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,290

Wait, wait, okay, I'm going to feed Dad.

I'm sorry, I got to feed him.

319
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,730
He's going to keep barking.

He's he won.

321
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,770
He won.

322
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,240
He always knows what I'm doing.

323
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,120
He's sponsoring.

324
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,480
He always knows.

325
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,340
He.

326
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,320
Okay, no, Snuffy was so good.

327
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,820
Like, she did all of it one take.

328
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:55,700
She was so like you could tell that she plays VR That it was like I was like plus one RP, you know, but you tell she role plays

329
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,280
Pippa's here snuffie's here.

330
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,740
Maybe we have a chance.

331
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,120
No, it's still not enough What do we do?

332
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,720
How do we get the word out?

333
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,180
If only more could just miraculously show up.

334
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,740
I guess I'm here now, too

335
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,000
Now you guys know why I know who Rapunzel

336
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:46,180
Guys this is why I know I know exactly I know exactly what Rapunzel looks like I was like okay I didn't realize I was a like later on.

337
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,440
I was like, wait, I'm a healer.

338
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,940
I was like the healer of the group.

339
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,980
I didn't realize.

340
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:56,760
I mean, to be fair, looking at the costume, you would like, you would think, oh yeah, no, that has to be a healer.

341
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,060
I was just like, I wasn't thinking that.

342
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,980
I was a sound guy.

343
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,140
Should I up the volume?

344
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,140
Yeah, I was in support jail.

345
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,100
Everyone had a gun and I was like, don't worry.

346
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,880
I'll heal you.

347
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:45,860
the dps but you guys want me to a little bit up okay up a little bit no way is he a jokie the bird thank you so much oh right i'll i'll be sure to i'm not here to do it for free of course so oh yeah i wouldn't ask of that right right okay and then okay i i i Okay,

348
00:30:46,640 --> 00:31:16,740
and then like Dokey the bird Okay, by the way There was one time We did two takes And it was because I was muted on the first take And then like everyone was like Dokey I guess I forgot to mute myself Because they're like Guys remember to mute yourselves When we're doing the intros I was like gotcha And then you know I haven't played VR in so long So I forgot to unmute myself.

349
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,660
So, um, so this was the one time we had to do two takes and it was just because I forgot to unmute.

350
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:39,460
And also, and yes to note, later, I didn't know who Rapunzel was because like, I didn't know what, because like I said, I, um, they hit me up like two days before the recording.

351
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,660
So I was like a last minute substitute.

352
00:31:44,840 --> 00:32:39,920
of that i didn't know what character i was assigned to so they i was just like um they showed me like a screenshot and i was like oh that's so cool like we're gonna have costumes and everything and i didn't know exactly who i was until like we had later on you'll see we saw like pictures of who were supposed to be and then I saw mine and I was like wow I look just like her and then stuffy was like yeah but you're sort of missing like one or two parts I guess I could do it for a bit of a bargain you know what I'll take it sometimes the best also my full body tracking was not working I'll explain the rest of the story later.

353
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,580
Yeah, two very important parts we're missing.

354
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,260
I was like, I was like, I couldn't get it to work.

355
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,320
And then got my, I only got my waist to work.

356
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,460
Yeah, I was missing a little bit of some personality.

357
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,080
The pun's so deep.

358
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,400
It was a very, very strong sports bra.

359
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,200
Another really long weapon.

360
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,140
Yes, well, I mean, that's...

361
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,020
But I hope the sound is a little better.

362
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:23,240
up if he needed to yeah right where we're not gonna reach that i mean we could stack on top of each other but wow it's looking great we've really assembled the avengers we're just missing one more person.

363
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,340
I don't even know how to say that.

364
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,360
See-tubers assemble.

365
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,040
I think at that point I think I sat down.

366
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,920
That's why you don't see me.

367
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I sat down because I was like, in frame I was tired I yeah yeah and head stood up yeah let's head to the war room to

368
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:40,840
oh yeah well now it's like whoa you're drifting I'm pointing this thing And then Louie's just like, wait for him.

369
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,640
Wait for me.

370
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah, support characters need a rest too, guys.

371
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,140
So the enemy knows we need business.

372
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,980
Bro, she's plus one RP plus one.

373
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,080
It's even worse than I thought.

374
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,200
The queen of raptures.

375
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,980
She's the entity that broke into our orbit.

376
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,390
But we do.

377
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,710
Her power abilities are far beyond our own.

378
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,190
I could take her.

379
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,890
You can tell I didn't know what I was a support.

380
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,150
That was the most...

381
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,550
I didn't know who I was.

382
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:26,490
I...

383
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,610
I didn't know I was a support.

384
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,330
I was like, I'm going to take her.

385
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,610
Yeah, I thought I was like a magician or something.

386
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,490
I...

387
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,730
Yeah, I was a magician.

388
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,550
very confident support.

389
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,750
It was later on I figured out.

390
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,790
In a fight, right?

391
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,090
I'm a front line.

392
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,850
Yeah, I'm a combat medic, guys.

393
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,630
Emphasis on combat.

394
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:09,130
Like I said, like, we were experiencing each world, like, for the first time for this, for this recording.

395
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,710
Yeah, I think so.

396
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,850
Somehow managed to survive the blast, but look at Eden.

397
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,350
It's gone.

398
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,390
Look at all the drugs.

399
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:22,990
Oh, no.

400
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,270
Just give me a deep end, guys.

401
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,070
I guess.

402
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,750
Guys, I think...

403
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,910
Guys, you think this looks bad?

404
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,710
I don't know about this one, Chief.

405
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,710
I got my...

406
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,530
But at least the monitors salvageable.

407
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:58,670
Oh, yeah, look, there's there's monitors still still intact My dove that way She's not okay You still look so intact

408
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:47,060
Let's get some reinforcements Okay, so this at this part at this part we we're just playing the story at that point what was funny was like guys um we want you to play until chapter 12 and then i was like what chapter are we on and then they're like we're chapter one i was like we're not getting the chapter 12 guys we're i was like and they're like to chapter for it and then like i was like i don't think we're even gonna make it

409
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:12,420
you can tell when i started sitting down too you can tell when i was like wait this is a long chapter

410
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,900
Don't heal her.

411
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,100
I didn't know I was a support yet.

412
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,200
I'm going to grab a chair.

413
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,020
Yeah, I healed the TV.

414
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,660
I picked up the television.

415
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,880
I saw other people sitting.

416
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,520
See, look, they were all sitting.

417
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,700
It wasn't just...

418
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,920
me so i didn't okay too bad i didn't know i could chief the staff until later

419
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:23,460
well so this is basically us experiencing the story for the like reading the story for the third anniversary chapter internal power sources as well as some underground generators nearby oh thank god and we'll be able to use it soon although It will only be operating at 50% of the time.

420
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,720
All right, I will be frank with you guys.

421
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,400
I read the briefing like five minutes before the recording.

422
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,980
But I have a very perfectly good explanation for it.

423
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,600
I'll tell you the story later after this.

424
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,900
But I'll tell you.

425
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
I was like, I was so messed.

426
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,680
Yeah, maybe it's worth sacrificing.

427
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,600
That would result in an...

428
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,300
Doki enhanced.

429
00:39:50,720 --> 00:40:54,400
but most of eden's facilities have been destroyed do it try to secure maximum output there was a reason there was a reason too once and for all once and for all that's what i'm hoping for the queen is stationary right now also to be yeah i was so chilled i was so relaxed at that point i was just enjoying this story uh also like it even know i was on time for the recording but like we didn't start until 40 minutes later so it gave me time to fully read the work read the briefing see she can't move so easy vulnerable yeah yeah see the queen i was like oh the rapture is just in the sky we like she's not moving why yeah i was man's threat see i knew how i knew how to remove the staff here yeah or maybe there's some kind of malfunction

430
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:23,880
you're a big hat my big gun i think we got this yeah which is all bonker at the same time you're clearly having a good look at that giant ass gun i don't have that weapon also like Lumi, okay, the reason why no camera angle is like on the side to Lumi's model is because it is TOS.

431
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,640
It is like, it is not TOS friendly.

432
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,580
It was, no, she was not wearing much underneath.

433
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,340
I just let you guys know that.

434
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,640
So we had to like make sure the camera angle was just right.

435
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,040
And also like, I can't show it on stream.

436
00:41:44,160 --> 00:42:44,550
but like I had in in VR in VR I had it so that like you know like in case like you know there's so many people in the uh in the world um I had it like turn the security the security section all the way up so like the model textures because like models won't like lag my VR headset so um because I did that the textures were like really like really like low quality and because of that I wish I could show it to you guys but I think it YouTube would say that's not TOS friendly but like bow's bow's left boob was showing but there was a hole like a giant ass hole where the nipple was and I was like what the I wish I could show it I like took a screenshot of it posted it to I think it's just like,

437
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:50,510
it was just like, like their lip boob was just popping up, but it was, the nipple was like the void.

438
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,730
I was like, what's wrong, what's wrong with your boob?

439
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,330
What, what's wrong with it?

440
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,330
Do not stare into the void.

441
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,890
I stared into the void and stared back.

442
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,090
Oh, bring up a little more.

443
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:18,850
Okay.

444
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:19,950
I did.

445
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,730
He's so edgy, though.

446
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:25,170
We were like...

447
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,910
We were just like making weird words.

448
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,230
Just like roasting the guy.

449
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,090
He was so edgy.

450
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,070
You know?

451
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,470
He was so serious.

452
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,160
Oh yeah, we started seeing.

453
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,080
our characters as we kept going.

454
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,540
Yeah, and then, yeah, and then, yeah, and then I was like...

455
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,020
That's when they showed Rapunzel, that's when I knew I was like, oh!

456
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,100
I'm here?

457
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,580
Yeah, I was like, what?

458
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,640
See?

459
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,260
Do you hear that?

460
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,560
Do you hear what stuff you said?

461
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,560
I'll rewind it.

462
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:34,180
I think you're missing a part of your character.

463
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,710
I'm thinking how you're missing a part of your character.

464
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:42,490
Yeah.

465
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,030
Just a little part of it.

466
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,570
And yeah, I still didn't realize I was a support.

467
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,670
I still didn't realize.

468
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,410
Yes.

469
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:25,030
I'm wearing a sports bra okay it's a very very strong sports bra possesses the wit to discern her machinations to decide her machinations yes young lady Dorothy is not at Eden presently I hear say she does reside within the art I think we're in the future Are we like old now?

470
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:25,810
That's not good.

471
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,990
Oh my god, we're like hags, yeah.

472
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:29,990

490
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,520
The queen will descend anon.

491
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,220
Anon.

492
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,860
Eden does prepare to intercept the queen.

493
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,200
Someone's having a good time.

494
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:43,920
Maidens.

495
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,040
What a polite thing to say.

496
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,840
We're just chilling.

497
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,180
What's happening?

498
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,980
Look up in the sky.

499
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:51,780
Is it burning?

500
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,020
It's it's getting dark.

501
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,080
Oh, Amazon delivery drones.

502
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,520
Oh, what a grievous flight.

503
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,440
What a grievous flight.

504
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,620
Guys, the sky is red.

505
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
That's a good thing, right?

506
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,180
Good one, Pastofi.

507
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,440
You're so funny.

508
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,080
I felt bad.

509
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,240
Red means good, right, guys?

510
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,060
I like this, Pastofi.

511
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,100
Wait, she's pretty big, guys.

512
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,380

How do you know that?

518
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,560
I'm fired.

519
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,260
Let's go to HR, Pastor Oki.

520
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:16,660
Whoa!

521
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:17,880
Whoa!

522
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,800
Do not talk to her like that!

523
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,300
She is a queen!

524
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,260
He cannot answer you!

525
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,460
I might not be good at acting.

526
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,200
I'm sure.

527
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,100

Oh, she's so funny.

530
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,120
Ha ha.

531
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,620
Oh, the pilgrims.

532
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,180
I got to us.

533
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,200
I was kind of disgusted.

534
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,340
Make yourselves at home.

535
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,800
Oh, like, we don't like each other.

536
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,760
Okay, okay, that's fine.

537
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:19,980
Awkward.

538
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,440
Are they fighting?

539
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,600
Do they not get along?

540
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,440
Yeah, we're beefing.

541
00:50:24,480 --> 00:52:04,900
I will say, I can't react because past Doki already reacted for me i'm watching myself first time reacting to the chapter of nike and everything i want to say she's already said it so i'm just enjoying the enjoying the time pastor he was just too good like a re-acception i'm now a real streamer for like 10 minutes yeah i feel like she should have arrived by now yeah that's true is she going like 0.01 miles per hour or something yeah she's lagging servers are down she has like 300 ping yeah we missed the exit that the queen's vision was either greatly impaired or wholly unsafe i'll also let you guys know the reason why i'm always like fixing my headset because you remember when I tweeted how I was so proud of myself for cleaning my closet I also threw away my my all my contact lenses and then on that day at nighttime my manager contacted me and was like oh we have a last minute sponsor it's VR chat in Nikkei and I was like good and then I didn't So I had to wear my glasses Trying to do

542
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:25,060
it It was the very first time Yeah, it was very awful timing Like I literally I already threw away the trash I already threw away the trash bags And they were like I threw away all my contact lenses Because I was like I don't need those I'm like I should get a new I should get like New prescription for them anyway So like because they were an old prescription So I was like Oh,

543
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:58,580
I don't need those When will I ever wear contact lenses Because I haven't worn them in a very long time and then so so like you know obviously it was my very first time uh we're trying to wear glasses with the headset and like my glasses kept like touching my eye so it would like smudge the lenses so I always had to like clean my glasses like every like five five to ten minutes because I couldn't see I couldn't see anything because the headset kept pushing it against my eye

544
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,280
Yeah, no, it's not fun.

545
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,300
It's not fun having glasses on with VR.

546
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,960
Like, that's why I always had contact lenses until that day.

547
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,200
Literally a blind reaction.

548
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,840
She does linger.

549
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,580
I'm going to have a bingo sheet.

550
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,980
How many dots can we hit?

551
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,580
Take a shot.

552
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:59,800
take a shot from here now you guys know why i was like i don't think we're making it to chapter four guys like i was just out guys i don't think it's possible because this is this is chapter one and like i was going very fast like she was just clicking i'd like a tour of the facility what facilities it's gone Good one,

I'm like, what do we have left?

555
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,700
I will try my best to see that your requests are met.

556
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,020
I want meat and bread.

557
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,680
Very well.

558
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,940
Good job, yeah.

559
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,280
Good one, jokie.

560
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,020
I laugh.

561
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,100
I'm killing it, guys.

562
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,730
Could you stop being such a...

563
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,810
I'm actually...

564
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,050
Guys, you think, okay, wait, wait, let me...

565
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,650
Guys, wait, let me show you something.

566
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,430
Alright, uh...

567
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,910
Alright, where is it?

568
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,650
Oh, wait, did I save it?

569
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,590
Wait, did I...

570
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:47,430
Oh, no!

571
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,890
Wait, where is it?

572
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,690
Wait, I have to...

573
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:51,410
Okay, guys.

574
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,760
Alright, let me grab this.

575
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,380
I think it's pretty accurate.

576
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,340
I'm just missing one or two details, guys.

577
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,780
I think it was pretty accurate.

578
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,440
Look, I am a support player.

579
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,760
So because of that, I had to wear a support bra, you know?

580
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,960
I had to wear a sports bra to support it.

581
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,720
It's literally the same person.

582
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:33,580
Like, I was in a battlefield.

583
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:49,060
okay i had to wear that sports bra you've been starving i'll go check the infirmary and defense systems good pair up and show them around it's the same picture i'm

584
00:55:52,740 --> 00:56:02,620
not sharing my food just so you know gladly i'm not sharing my fine isabel go everybody take off your shoes that's my request Don't worry.

585
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,040
Oh.

586
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,440
Oh.

587
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,000
No shoes indoors, guys.

588
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,720
Well, I guess it is what it is.

589
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,800
I'm actually chill maxing now because like, I was like, I was like, we have four chapters to go through.

590
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,640
I'm, I'm fucking chill maxing.

591
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,100
Oh, really?

592
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:24,740
Yeah.

593
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,000
Shouldn't we be figuring out how to get up there?

594
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,660
Hey, yeah.

595
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,040
Yeah.

596
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,160
How do we get up there?

597
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,280
I mean, we just wait for her to get down here.

598
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,120
That's true.

599
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,980
You know, a good point.

600
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,560
Why go up when she goes down?

601
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,580
Good one, Pastoki.

602
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,440
God, you're so good at this.

603
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,120
You're so funny.

604
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,780
How do you come up with this on the fly?

605
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,200
I'm counting on you guys.

606
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,700
Sorry to interrupt.

607
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,420
But considering the queen might fire another beam.

608
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,460
Because it's true.

609
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,280
She's coming down.

610
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160
We have to make the effort to go up.

611
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,140
I agree.

612
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,500
We lose Eden Spear.

613
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,380
We're completely out of option.

614
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,500
It's also unlikely that the Queen can carry out such large-scale attacks.

615
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,960
It's hard to run around with those understandable.

616
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,580
Thank you for the super chat, Zero.

617
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,140
Thank you.

618
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:24,800
Thank you.

619
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,420
She's so polite.

620
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,900
It's also okay.

621
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,460
But that's all an assumption on your part.

622
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,220
What will you do if she does fire again?

623
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,840
If another beam does strike, we'll all die.

624
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,060
And that means our assumption was wrong.

625
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,180
And since we'll all be dead, we should just move it over here.

626
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,760
Thy words mirror those of young hero Johan to the letter.

627
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,820
You're right, I'm more aerodynamic.

628
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,480
See, I'm thinking about, like, I'm min-maxing.

629
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,960
We have a giant mirror.

630
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,100
We can reflect it.

631
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,120
Wait, physics.

632
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,160
We could use a TV screen.

633
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,580
Oh, true.

634
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,180
I'm so fucking stupid.

635
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,320
I'm so stupid.

636
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,140
Defending the Eden.

637
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,160
We put us in.

638
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,320
How did you put us in?

639
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,500
Great joke, Bastog.

640
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,360
Who's this girl?

641
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,040
Come on.

642
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,640
I didn't roll for you guys yet.

643
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,420
My bad.

644
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,740
Wow.

645
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,540
Oh, yeah, she wasn't even using us.

646
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,320
She was using girls that aren't even us.

647
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,860
Like, what the heck?

648
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,060
Why are we not showcasing this?

649
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,780
We're not better than them forever.

650
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,540
I can't believe this is our story!

651
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,580
We're the B team, apparently.

652
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,280
Already benched.

653
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,840
We barely benched.

654
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,740
Fated only to be an S.

655
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:31,520

656
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:32,580
A poisoned power?

657
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:33,920
YouTubers, disband.

658
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:34,460
Ooh!

659
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,500
We're gonna poison the queen!

660
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,280
The amount of raptures we're dealing with is no joke.

661
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,280
But we hold them on.

662
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,760
Disband it before it happened.

663
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,720
We are just the lore squad.

664
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,700
We're here to give exposition.

665
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,900
Oh, your hands are going.

666
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:55,940
Again?

667
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,060
Is that normal?

668
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,220
Is that- you do that?

669
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,260
Yeah.

670
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,400
There's- Oh, there's just frostbite here.

671
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,520
Oh, she's chilly.

672
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,980
There's no way to know.

673
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,520
All the more caused to doubt her trust.

674
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,960
That is why, er, any mis- We must need secure body bullet.

675
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:20,560
Monk.

676
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,360
I love the noise you're saving.

677
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,660
This was where at that point, the staff was like, okay, just spam click it.

678
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,180
We got it.

679
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,540
We got to keep going.

680
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,160
There's a lot more stuff we have to do.

681
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,800
Yeah, at that point, that's why you can tell the crew They're like, okay about just just keep clicking it.

682
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,760
We got to get move on.

683
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,460
We uh Why did she did she die?

684
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,760
Hmm, it's not bad.

685
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,080
Isabel now art adept in the arts of aerial combat.

686
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,600
I've got a short range weapon anyway Who do I need to engage in close?

687
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,340
I don't know

688
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,920
I feel so educated Anything else, honey?

689
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,900
You know why?

690
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:28,000
She was asking Bao Because they were like Okay, we're going to have someone Who has the most knowledge of Nike To do this part of the game So and then in the thing It was like It will be Bao because she has the most knowledge

691
01:01:31,380 --> 01:02:06,780

692
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:12,060
We gotta consume the lore guys Guys, it's not just this by the way.

693
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,320

01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,040
There's more.

695
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,880
We're not going through four chapters guys.

01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,400

Yes!

700
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,060
Pre-gaming!

701
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,740
Pre-gaming!

702
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:36,540
Pre-gaming!

703
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,400
Yeah, can Nikkei's pre-gaming?

704
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,640
And we pre-gaming!

705
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,260
Oh, that's true.

706
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,020
Yeah, they just take diesel instead of unleaded.

707
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,880
Yeah, I was gonna say, can Nikkei even get tipsy?

708
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,340
I didn't know.

709
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,980
I didn't know if I was allowed to say drunk.

710
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,660
So, I mean, I said it now.

711
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,500
So, but trying to pre-record it.

712
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,820
I didn't know.

713
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:05,140
I was like, can Nikes consume alcohol?

714
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Like, I...

715
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:12,820
So I was like, can Nikes get tipsy?

716
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,660
I was still trying to be very professional.

717
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,520
Yeah.

718
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,140
Yeah, now I know.

719
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,020
Now I know.

720
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,400
So now I'm able to say it.

721
01:03:30,500 --> 01:04:57,680
at that time i wasn't sure i was like i was a little confused how do you plan on defeating the original queen up there tell me your plan i was so professional yeah pastor kew was so professional that's correct don't tell me no way you're not suggesting that we ally with eden to fight the queen are you disgusting is it better to increase our chances of victory even just a little no absolutely that's gross let's go rose why it looks so happy on the other side wait it looks so nice you know like the the meme where like one side's like you turn right and it's hell and you turn left just like like heaven good lord the plot yeah what is this coronation you speak of it's when one puts on the crown hmm so what you're saying is you're helping Marion become the Queen Marion why given the gravity of what you're discussing could you put a bit more thought into your questions we actually did not see this part of the game so This is new for me.

722
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,580
I'm just like, what?

723
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,800
I don't remember this in the recording.

724
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,300
Don't worry, the support is here.

725
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,350
Oh, it's Marion Mordernia?

726
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,670
Oh, that's the true name.

727
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:20,170
Because I'm tired of this.

728
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:21,690
And I'm disappointed.

729
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,910
Disappointed in the queen?

730
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:26,710
Yes.

731
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:33,590
Well, I understand she drifted through space for over a century because of an accident.

732
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:34,910
What accident?

733
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,390
That's not your fault.

734
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:38,290
The queen has become a coward.

735
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:43,270
She could have corrected her orbit and descended to the surface right away.

736
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,470
But she didn't.

737
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:47,290
Why?

738
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:49,370
Because she was afraid.

739
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,510
Why was she afraid?

740
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,910
Oh wait, no, she is still alive.

741
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,630
I know because I have Cinderella on my team.

742
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,670
These fears stopped her from acting.

743
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:05,170
Anyway, she didn't come down to the surface because she was scared.

744
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,650
I like to help her.

745
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:11,390
I think she needs all the support, guys.

746
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,610
That makes sense.

747
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,590
So I took it upon myself to make a queen.

748
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:21,230
Then I tried a little of this and that.

749
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,890
Fortunately, a queen came into being.

750
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:30,230
That's why I want to make Marion the queen, no matter what it takes.

751
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,830
And you don't want to be the queen yourself?

752
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,030
Yeah, I don't want to be queen.

753
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,270
It seems like you already have all the plans for it.

754
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:42,750
I'm nothing but a data-based life form with no corporeal body.

755
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,110
That's not your real body?

756
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:48,530
Form is just a mimic of the person whose personality data I'm based on.

757
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,170
Oh my, that's a very big personality, though.

758
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:54,890
The truth is, I want someone I can...

759
01:06:54,910 --> 01:07:12,850
control to be the queen she was a nun back then that's right like me i can't say i i can't say anything if i say anything i have to go to confessional i have to repent if i say something

760
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:27,110
you are quite literally my bodyguard and my sword Isn't that what you'd call a puppet?

761
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,990
I prefer the term proxy.

762
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,830
That is not a nun outfit.

763
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:33,790
What?

764
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,130
A nun outfit is like baggier.

765
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,230
Like that is...

766
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:45,610
I think she got the child size of the nun outfit.

767
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,530
I'm fine for now.

768
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:51,450
Do bring some next time, if you please.

769
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,490
They're in my room.

770
01:07:54,910 --> 01:09:00,740

771
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,480
Lady Papio.

772
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,260
Wait, what happened?

773
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,400
How did it get here?

774
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,460
Oh, that's me!

775
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,240
That's me.

776
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,560
It looks just like me.

777
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,040
Wait, it seems a bit low.

778
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,000
That thing is huge.

779
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,640
How is that even possible?

780
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,220
At the very least, we should be able to protect Eden's fear.

781
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:36,020
wait it seems a bit low i can bring it up again is it better or should i be louder

782
01:09:48,980 --> 01:10:07,540
why did it give me rapunza i was a last minute sub so when um you know like someone that couldn't make it so the person that couldn't make it was rapunza so they gave me rapunza I

783
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,240
have failed.

784
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,840
I pray thy forgiveness.

785
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,100
Bring her inside for now.

786
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:21,140
Cecil.

787
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,860
So, this makes the third heretic you've let inside.

788
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,840
You have to bring it down when everyone's together again.

789
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,740
Okay, let me know when I have to bring it down.

790
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,800
The weapons developed

791
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,440
and it held up relatively well against the being.

792
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,300
Prithi, show us the way.

793
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:45,560
Find it yourself.

794
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,240
I'm busy.

795
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,680
Oh, we're busy for what?

796
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,520
I don't even know what you're doing.

797
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,070
I shall assist thee.

798
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,290
I bear ill tidings, young hero.

799
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:03,230
Out with it.

800
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:08,470
The maiden of thunder and the loquacious one shall verily join the fray.

801
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:11,730
What is he even doing?

802
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:12,990
He said he's busy.

803
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:14,210
Busy doing what?

804
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,810
He's just standing there.

805
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,430
Fire Dragon may verily join them as well.

806
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:31,110
It must be because of that signal that's similar to the calling signal the queen emitted earlier truly so Fine, I'll make the preparation.

807
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:32,690
Where is he?

808
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:48,790
Yeah, he does sound like him albeit slowly Tis simply for that she has sustained a grievous wound so formidable an adversary did she need?

809
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,930
me right now what happened

810
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:29,970
having beheld eden spear i humbly apologize by my own lips i cannot reveal the reason unless young lady marion herself chooses to disclose it i may not speak of it all right the queen's energy signature detected everyone prepare for bombardment oh no bombardment bombardment how much longer must we tarry You mean that thing's coming again?

811
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:32,910
Oh, no.

812
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,630
So you heard it too, huh?

813
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:39,850
Well, if we can't block this, Eden's totally screwed.

814
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:41,750
Uh-huh.

815
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,070
Can you really block it?

816
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,110
Okay.

817
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,270
I assume that...

818
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,970
Okay, okay, we're gonna go to the part where I found out I was a healer.

819
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,210
Wait, we're almost there.

820
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:05,510
Where the staff was like, okay, Doki, as the healer, I was like, me?

You'll understand.

823
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:29,460
I didn't even know who I was until I got to the recording, guys.

824
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,440
I didn't know what gave me to.

825
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,500
I was assigned.

826
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,580
If I knew, I would have looked her up.

827
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:42,330
No,

828
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,610
I thought I was like a magician.

829
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,690
I don't know.

830
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:51,710
I thought I knew magic.

831
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,970
I thought I was a whizzy.

832
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:18,310
Oh, no.

833
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,060
She's the strongest.

834
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,980
See, I told you she can take her.

835
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,260
All right.

836
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,700
The situation that's so dire.

837
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,900

Oh, no.

859
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,240
I know you can.

860
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,480
I can heal this.

861
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,060
No!

862
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,620
Power of money.

863
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,860
I'll pay your hospital bills.

864
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,320
I don't know if it didn't work, guys.

865
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,540
What the hell?

866
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:43,460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry everyone, the moment I was just so funny.

867
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,240
She's dying and you're laughing, don't you?

868
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,160
What the fuck?

869
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,300
She's dying.

870
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:58,820
I'm sorry, it was so funny.

871
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,860
This is just a moment.

872
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,100
We must use our reach.

873
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,240
Towards our meaning.

874
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:09,760
Enemy!

875
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,140
The rapture queen!

876
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,320
No more fallen comrades!

877
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,580
It ends here!

878
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:20,940
She's dying and you just throw money at her.

879
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:25,040
In the battlefield, there are only two kinds of people.

880
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,760
There was no script!

881
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,920
They were just like...

882
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,120
They were just like...

883
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:33,440
Yeah!

884
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,720
They were just like, they were just like, we're over the heel of them.

885
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,600
And I was like, okay.

886
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,660
against those clankers!

887
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,340
Yeah!

888
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,380
Oh yeah, Val was like, can I say clankers?

889
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,160
And they're like, yeah.

890
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:49,320
Okay!

891
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,260
Let's go!

892
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,080
We

893
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:04,380
wrote the script.

894
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,760
There was no script.

895
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:07,840
It was just vibes.

896
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,680
They were like, okay, so you're gonna fight these.

897
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,180
They were like, I told you guys, I told you the script!

898
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:34,700
It was literally like, okay, Joki, they're gonna like the Two people are gonna walk up to you and you're gonna heal them and I was like got it And I didn't even realize Bao was gonna do her whole monologue So I started laughing because I was not expecting it

899

It is literally I'm going through vibes and improv right now Hey

900
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,860
I mean,

901
01:18:59,520 --> 01:18:59,980
that's true.

902
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,820
Why don't I just shoot the queen?

903
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,240
Oh, no, the support got a gun.

904
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,100
I'm going to have to start healing with my AK.

905
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,960
I'm dual wielding.

906
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:15,980

I was doing gangster style.

909
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,530
It kept going!

910
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:10,770
Because you're- I didn't put enough XP in shooting apparently.

911

912
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,860

There's no way I can get the big boy.

929
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,330
That's right!

930
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,470
Frontline support, Doki!

931
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,270
Frontline!

932
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,350
It's so intense.

933
01:21:56,310 --> 01:22:06,910
I did not realize they were like, they were like right in front of me.

934
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:17,110
Look,

935
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,320
I wasn't last minute so, okay?

936
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,580
I wasn't last minute.

937
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,600
I didn't say his kiss.

938
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:35,720
I didn't like it.

939
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,500
Like, I was tied there for it.

940
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,020
Cut out.

941
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:55,940
I didn't.

942
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,380
I didn't.

943
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:58,700
I didn't.

944
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,200
I think they want something.

945
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,400
It's gonna be a while, guys.

946
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,660
I'm gonna get it.

947
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,620
Come on, come on.

948
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:09,760
Nope.

949
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:13,300
We were shooting for five minutes already.

950
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,180
I got tired.

951
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:24,540
Like we're shooting for five minutes and none of it was taking forever to die.

952
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,000
We didn't do our ammo.

953
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,220
I used all the ammo in the boss.

954
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,060
Everything that was done might have gotten stuck.

955
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,940
I'm taking out of it.

956
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,820
We're out of the avalanche.

957
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,740
We actually did it.

958
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,800
We're out of avalanche, everyone.

959
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,500
We did it!

960
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:51,700
We did it!

961
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:52,440
Yay!

962
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,740
Take our skills to the final test.

963
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,200
To rebuild the Eden Spear.

964
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,600
With that, we can finally do it.

965
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:08,300
There was supposed to be five ways, but after two ways, we're like, we're going next, right?

966
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,960
Like, we're going to go to the next world, guys.

967
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,660
That's why I sat down.

968
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,100
We still have to rebuild the spear of Eden.

969
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:26,940
Oh, I think there's a really big piece over there.

970
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,300
That wasn't over.

971
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,000
Barely.

972
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:30,400
We should grab that.

973
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:30,880
We shall.

974
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:31,800
That made it.

975
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,760
Let's go grab that part.

976
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,340
Whoa, plus one RP.

977
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:36,900
Plus one.

978
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,240
Look, see, I stood back up, guys.

979
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:41,560
I'm standing again.

980
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,520
I love how she's just drifting.

981
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,700
There's no, like, feet animation.

982
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,340
Okay, ready?

983
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,820
We're ready to go.

984
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,400
She's rollerblading.

985
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,820
Oh, there it is.

986
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,380
Over here, hot potato.

987
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's go.

988
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:10,260
Come on.

989
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:10,600
Oh,

990
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:33,460
okay, okay, I'm so funny.

991
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,360
God, I'm so funny.

992
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,900
Oh, it's gone.

993
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,440
Oh, no, it's there.

994
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:40,280
Oh, it's over there.

995
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,280
Good one, fast-dokie.

996
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,580
Why can't I be?

997
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:59,080

Oh, shit.

1018
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:09,190
Hmm.

1019
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:12,710
So, uh, maybe we cast a magic spell or something.

1020
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:15,430
Wait, if I was trying to cast a magic spell, just cast a magic spell.

1021
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:16,750
Oh, shit.

1022
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,570

01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:56,450
Okay, that was not planned.

1026
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,090
I didn't think it would actually work.

1027
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:01,830
I literally threw bunny and then the animation started playing.

1028
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:03,870
I was not ready for that.

1029
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,790
Fire and a spear.

1030
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,070
Oh, that too.

1031
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,450
But yeah, fire and a spear.

1032
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:21,190
Wait, before, before, before we were like action, we were like as a girl, I was like, okay, I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna say that.

And then like, and then 200 people started talking.

1038
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:38,210
And I'm like, wait, I thought I say fire the spear.

1039
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:45,250
So it was like right here.

1040
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:50,950
Like, fire the spear.

1041
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:53,250
Oh, that too.

1042
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,470
But yeah, fire the spear.

1043
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,030
We did it!

1044
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:04,290
We're so good!

1045
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,610

1050
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:16,730
Oh, this was one take!

1051
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:22,530
We couldn't do retakes!

1052
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:26,170
I just had to roll with it!

1053
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,590
With the power of friendship!

1054
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,170
And Nikkei!

1055
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,510

1056
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:33,430

1057
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:33,690
Yeah!

1058
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:38,570
We finally celebrate the Nika third anniversary!

1059
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:39,730
Yeah!

1060
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:47,510

1061
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:48,670
Thank you, Nika!

1062
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:50,230
Yeah!

1063
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:52,590
Amazing.

1064
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:55,250
I think I did pretty well as a sub, guys.

1065
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,050
As a last minute substitute.

1066
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:59,270
What is your dailies, everyone?

1067
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,570
What?

1068
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:03,550
That's the last line!

1069
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,590
That's the last thing you hear?

1070
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:11,930
Are you okay?

1071
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:13,390
I'll give you a lie.

1072
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,180
Four things have happened.

1073
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,180
Remember to do your dailies.

1074
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,720
Niki, goddess of victory.

1075
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,480
The part.

1076
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,620
Don't forget your dailies.

1077
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,880
these everyone we said oh they're so

1078
01:33:49,230 --> 01:34:11,150
happy remember to do your polls guys so beautiful guys

1079
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:19,710
Remember to do your pause, everyone.

1080
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:25,550
Remember to do your dailies.

1081
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:39,050
I should have been like, hey everyone, remember to click the link pinned in our chats and remind us of a plus two sponsor.

1082
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:44,890
I didn't realize that's the last line in the entire video.

1083
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:47,650
to do your dailies.

1084
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,270
God is a victory.

1085
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:49,910
Niki.

1086
01:34:53,890 --> 01:35:06,730
But yes, honestly, I think I did so well as a last minute substitution into the sponsor because everyone else was apparently they were confirmed while, yo.

1087
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:10,310
And, you know, I got plopped in.

1088
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:20,910
Got my, got the briefing, like, the day before the recording, I think I did really well with what I was given.

1089
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:28,670
I think I rolled with it really well, I guess.

1090
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:34,750
I think I, like, added to the to the syn- to the Thetir, you know?

1091
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:41,430
Like, I was- I had a lot of content to this.

1092
01:35:44,390 --> 01:36:20,910
Oh, I gotta say, I'm glad you're happy with your streaming job but anyway anyway if you guys i will say no wait i still have like a lot of stuff to tell you guys i have another i have a special video to show you guys that only i have um but uh guys if you uh um please feel free to click the link pinned in the chat or in the description below because it does help out the stream and the sponsor a lot but no i got like I got received from the staff who did the recording of all of this.

1093
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:26,790
Because, like, all right, we'll finish watching this part because this is lore, guys.

1094
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:28,330
This is very important lore.

1095
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:32,090
This is what scripted stuff.

1096
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:35,410
You're like, do this.

1097
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,210
And this is the five.

1098
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:42,590
And then, like, you're, and then we believe in you.

1099
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:45,670
And I was like, that's not good, but okay.

1100
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,930
I don't know if you should believe in me.

1101
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,540
But you can tell that I was not like the...

1102
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,360
I wasn't the role player in the group.

1103
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:01,340
I was more of like the comedic relief.

1104
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,620
This is the story of our journey.

1105
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:06,360
Alright.

1106
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:11,100
So, to give context of this recording.

1107
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:12,860
So, when...

1108
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,780
You guys saw the two girls that I healed that were not part of our group.

1109
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,540
Like, who were they?

1110
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:22,480
So they were additional actors from the staff.

1111
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:28,540
And like, when they were like, okay, so our additional actors are going to go here to be these two characters.

1112
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,040
And you're going to have to heal them, Doki.

1113
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:30,880
And I was like, all right.

1114
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:34,360
But we had to wait for, I don't know what we were waiting for.

1115
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,300
But the staff had to like do something else.

1116
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,100
So me and the two actors, we were chilling in the corner.

1117
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,520
And then I was like, and I was like, oh, you guys have really good track.

1118
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:49,800
Why don't you dance for me?

1119
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,040
And...

1120
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,460
So I was getting my own personal show.

1121
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:06,660
You know, you know, foreshadowing, you know, Club Dokeybird.

1122
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,580
He's getting my own personal show.

1123
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:16,680
And that's when I learned about the money-throwing emoji.

1124
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:44,280
that's where i figured out i could throw money at them because i was like wait i remember in vr chat you can like you can like send custom emojis out so while they were trying to give you a private show that i was like oh my god like i i i figured out vr tech um and so we didn't get that recorded so when all the recordings were done um i was like let's celebrate everyone and i was like come

1125
01:38:55,940 --> 01:39:23,200
I was like come and dance for me and this was like you know after the fireworks and I was allowed to show this when I asked them like they sent me the footage by the way they recorded it I didn't think okay if I was like are you gonna record it yeah I recorded this and I was just like um they sent they edited this and sent it to me and And so,

1126
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,180
like, we were done, like, the fireworks and everything.

1127
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,280
We're like, let's celebrate, everyone.

1128
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,540
And, like, as a joke, I was like, come, dance for me.

1129
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,440
Um.

1130
01:39:54,270 --> 01:40:04,010
It's like, that was the after Friday.

01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:15,850
That was the, that was the, the after party of the recording, uh, running back, okay, okay.

1132
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:19,670

1153
01:42:26,170 --> 01:43:31,570
I remember what I think it was where it was a Minecraft stream I was like late for the Minecraft stream um but basically like this like caused me to have sleep debt because it like built up because of the recording um so like I said I wasn't going to take the sponsor at first because there was only two days they're like okay so uh we really need like uh Ken Doki did this like uh we had someone that couldn't make it and the recording is in two days um and then I was no it's like it's all everything is in vr and i have nothing set up for vr by the way i had nothing because if you guys didn't know i like had to move suddenly so i didn't bring my base stations for those who don't know what the base stations are they're the things that you you like you that tracks you basically that tracks the the rest of the vr kit stuff so it like looks finds the headset and the trackers and everything and they have to be on the walls so like obviously I didn't bring it because like they were stuck on the

1154
01:43:31,570 --> 01:44:54,190
walls so like um there was no way for me to uh you know bring it to my new place like because I had to move suddenly so um no I have the vibe it's the newer headset but I have the vibe so basically um but then they were like you um here's your this would be the pay and I was like I can do it and then and I looked up Amazon I was like how long till the base station arrives and it was the next day so or it was like two days I was like oh that works yeah I can do it I can do it because they're like oh it is super last minute so we'll pay you this and I was like I was like um you don't have to say anymore I'm fine like so so um the thing is i i got everything i got the base station i even ordered a ladder because like i had to use a ladder to like stick the to like put the base stations on the the walls i got i even ordered a ladder too but when i got the base station i realized wait i have no mounts for it I have those like double-sided wall tapes.

1155
01:44:54,810 --> 01:45:01,450
So I was thinking I was just going to use that tape on the base station and then just stick it on the wall.

1156
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,810
And then just like just that's just going to be it.

1157
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:11,150
So I, silly me, I received the base stations.

1158
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:11,950
This is what it is.

1159
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:13,510
I put the tapes on.

1160
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:16,370
And then I was like, all right, time to plug in the power.

1161
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:19,970
And you see that little power knob thing on the bottom?

1162
01:45:19,990 --> 01:46:23,450
them left so i couldn't stick it on the wall because the power thing was poking out so so i was like oh and by the way this was on the day so i had three hours all right yeah right after the the harbour mania stream i had to do this i had to set everything up so because i got all my stuff on that day i received like my packages on that day so right after the the alice stream i was like okay i got everything i gotta set up so i had three to four i think i don't remember if it was four hours or three hours but i had three to four hours to set up all my vr stuff and so so i was like i got this okay i just got sticky on the wall so and i was like wait a minute i forgot to buy the wall mounts so i was padding panicking very hard because I was like,

1163
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:35,050
oh fuck, I don't have, how am I supposed to perch these base stations on the wall if I don't have a mount?

1164
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:39,450
And I was Googling, I was like, where do I buy wall mounts in my city?

1165
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:41,730
And like, it was like, order on Amazon.

1166
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,170
And I was like, obviously, I couldn't do that.

1167
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:51,370
So, so there wasn't like a way to like, order it or buy it right now.

1168
01:46:52,050 --> 01:47:01,110
So, so in my head, I was like, wait, I have an audio foam.

1169
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:13,890
So, what I did was I grabbed one of the audio foams that I still have left.

1170
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:21,270
I taped the audio foam to the wall, base station.

1171
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:23,950
Very dangerous, by the way.

1172
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:32,610
I got on my ladder and I put the base station on top of the audio foam.

1173
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:35,910
So I got one done.

1174
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:37,330
Yeah, that looks so safe.

1175
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,630
It's still up there, by the way.

1176
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:40,510
It's actually still up there.

1177
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:47,910
So then I was like, okay, now I gotta do the other side, the wall where my PC is like facing.

1178
01:47:48,070 --> 01:48:01,930
So like I'm looking at that wall, like the So the thing is, in my head, I was like, okay, this should also work, you know, like, you know, it's, it's the same, it's the same mechanic.

1179
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:03,130
It's the same thing.

1180
01:48:03,530 --> 01:48:05,570
Like how, why would like, it should work?

1181
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,970
Because it worked on the other side.

1182
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:09,850
So I did it again.

1183
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:16,870
I put the audio foam against the wall, and I put the other base station there as well.

1184
01:48:17,370 --> 01:49:07,650
But it was very dangerous because I was like, my table was blocking the ladder so I couldn't move the table in a way where I could fit um where I could fit my ladder so it was like already tilted and there was like a little tiny gap of where the ladder could go so I had to like get on the ladder and then lean my body weight onto the wall and then like i tried so hard to like put it on it was so scary like i had to lean forward and put my body weight on the wall so i could reach the top of the audio foam and then like and i was like i did it i fucking did it and then literally two minutes later it was like

1185
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:17,590
because I was like, my base station, because they're $200 per station.

1186
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:20,450
So I was like, why didn't it work?

1187
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:22,110
I don't understand.

1188
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:23,850
Why didn't it work?

1189
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:28,470
It worked on the other side, and it's still working, but it's still taped up.

1190
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:30,870
This picture, it's still there.

1191
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:32,190
Like nothing has fallen.

1192
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:36,130
So then I was like, why isn't it working?

1193
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:38,250
Maybe I just need more tape.

1194
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:41,130
So then I start taping it like crazy.

1195
01:49:44,010 --> 01:50:42,070
start taping it crazy on the foam I was like and it's gorilla tape by the way I I'm fucked after like whenever I do move out of here I don't know what I'm gonna do but it's gorilla tape so I just put more tape on on on the foam because I was like in my head like that's how it's gonna work if I put more tape on it it'll be stronger so then i did that and you know i did the dangerous ladder thing again i did the i did the dangerous ladder thing again and then i put the base station up i was like that's it we got it and then five to ten minutes later i hear it it fell down and then it chipped the wall It's not okay.

1196
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:46,810
I'm glad my landlord doesn't know I'm a streamer.

1197
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:48,930
It like doesn't know my channel.

1198
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:50,390
It chipped the wall.

1199
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:57,950
But I was panicking because I was like, I was so scared that my base station was broken, but it's still okay.

1200
01:50:58,370 --> 01:51:01,470
It's, it's, it was, it's still okay.

1201
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:04,030
And there's like markings on the wall.

1202
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:09,510
So, so you were thinking, what does the wall look like?

1203
01:51:09,810 --> 01:51:12,590
So this is what the

1204
01:51:16,360 --> 01:52:15,780
wall looked like with the tape and so my game theory is that I think because it's underneath the vent the hot air is like fucking with the tape so because of that um because of that the um it's this yeah it looks like lost i showed this picture to snuffy and it's like this looks like the lost comic but yeah i think it was like it was melting the tape and that's why it wasn't sticking so obviously it was not sticking to the foam so obviously i was freaking out because i think at that point i had i didn't even um because like you know before then i was like setting up on my VR headset and stuff trying to find all the cables and stuff like that.

1205
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:17,260
They found and charging everything.

1206
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,780
So I found like all the cables.

1207
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:23,420
So I was freaking out because I think I had like one to two hours.

1208
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:26,500
I think it was like one and a half hours left.

1209
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:29,880
And I was like crying to my manager.

1210
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,600
And I was like, why did I take this fancy?

1211
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,060
Oh my God, I can't get it to work.

1212
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:39,600
It's not sticking to my wall.

1213
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,500
I showed him this photo.

1214
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:45,080
I was like, it's not working.

1215
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,880
I'm crying right now.

1216
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:49,780
I don't know what to do.

1217
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,300
And then I was just like, calm down.

1218
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,420
We have plan B.

1219
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:55,020
You just don't go in and track it.

1220
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:58,840
I was like, no, it would look so weird if I'm on my,

1221
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:05,660
no, I have to get this to work.

1222
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:13,040
By the way, after, you know, obviously I fixed it because you guys can see I was in VR.

1223
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,640
Like, obviously, but I'll tell you how I fixed it.

1224
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:39,120
how i fixed it um i was i i did manage to get it where because you see me moving my hands and everything because when you're in desktop you know you're like you can tell when you someone's on desktop because they can't move anything um but anyway um after we this recording and everything was done uh my manager was like that's that picture was pretty funny what

1225
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,560
he was like You know, that picture's pretty funny.

1226
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,580
You gotta show it.

1227
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:54,780
I was like, were you laughing while I was crying?

1228
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:59,640
And then, um, oh my god.

1229
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:04,340
Let me see if I can get, like, his exact, like, reply.

1230
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:09,360
Um, um, oh my god, give me a sec.

1231
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:14,600
I need a, I didn't feed him entirely, but now he's like, give me the rest of the food because he woke me up.

1232
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:15,820
All right, give me a sec.

1233
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:32,690
He got mad that I woke him up.

1234
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:33,770
So now he's demanding.

1235
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:36,590
He knows I don't feed the rest of the can.

1236
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:41,670
So I can use it as like, you know, I can use it as like a bribe for later.

1237
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:43,850
Because I don't want to give him more food.

1238
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:45,910
Oh my God, where was it?

1239
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,950
Uh, oh my God.

1240
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,270
I won't give you like the exact quote.

1241
01:54:54,810 --> 01:55:04,330
Yeah, I was like, uh, I was like, he was like, make sure to show this picture on stream.

1242
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:08,130
And then I was, and he was like, it's so fucking funny.

1243
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:11,310
And I was like, wait, were you laughing at this one?

1244
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:13,550
I was crying and sent you this photo.

1245
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:25,130
Cause the context of me sending this photo was like, I was like, he was like, how's the setup going?

1246
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,170
And I was like, I'm crying.

1247
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:34,390
I'm fucking crying right now.

1248
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:39,390
I think it's the face station up.

1249
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:41,130
Look at this.

1250
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:43,330
And then I sent out a photo.

1251
01:55:45,170 --> 01:55:48,090
And then I sent that photo.

1252
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:51,890
And he's like, and then I was like, what are you laughing at this?

1253
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:53,450
And I was crying.

1254
01:55:53,990 --> 01:56:02,350
And he was like, no, not at that moment, but after the recording was done, I was like, that was pretty funny photo.

1255
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:12,990
pretty funny photo it's like once you're done recording yeah it's funny I was like

1256
01:56:17,250 --> 01:57:01,610
and then while I was fucking crying and trying to get my VR stuff set up this okay so understandably you guys know how I have I have like like dad's doggy bed next to me like in my room and like it's next to like my chair so um obviously during like all of this I had to throw the bed the doggy bed outside my room right because I was like I need the space so you know I threw it out of the room and then dad decided to to still sit there watching me so

1257
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:13,290
So, while I was like, fucking crying, and like, it's like, what do I do?

1258
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:17,290
I want my face station sick.

1259
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:24,910
He was literally just sitting in the fucking doggy bed just looking at me.

1260
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:27,570
He was just looking at me outside my room.

1261
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:35,900
And then, and then.

1262
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:49,300
the emotion I used it's not it was definitely not an emotional support doc and I was like what the fuck are you looking at and then he's just like was she okay

1263
01:57:54,830 --> 01:59:32,360
are you good bro are you good like just judging me while I was like freaking crying trying to figure out because I had like at that point I had like an hour left so I was freaking out um and he's just sitting there like watching all of this happen after I like threw his doggy bed outside my room he didn't fucking care it's like doggy bed is a doggy bed and and then okay so like my last resort i got a i got my microphone box because i still kept it and then i was so desperate i was like i don't know what to do and i slammed the box into that tape corner and then it worked i was like wait wait it works and you would see thinking what does that look like well it looks like this I just kept my microphone popped I just slammed it in the garden and I put my pay station on top of that and it works it was a happy accident

1264
01:59:35,900 --> 02:00:06,780
and the thing is it didn't work it worked but I'm so glad that like it stayed I'll put the picture of the tape because that one was the funniest but like I'm so glad that the tape like like it's stay there for the entire recording because the next day the box was gone

1265
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:25,900
the next day the box and the base station was gone it it was it fell down so like thank god it like stayed up the entire recording um

1266
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:34,760
It basically collapsed itself.

1267
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:37,940
So it was like, but it happened the next day.

1268
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:38,520
So thank God.

1269
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:41,760
Because obviously, we went three hours overtime.

1270
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:48,120
And because it was like three hours overtime, I like, you know, I went to bed right after.

1271
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:50,160
It was like midnight, by the way, guys.

1272
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:54,120
Because like, Stephanie and I also like hanged out afterwards a little bit.

1273
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:59,120
Um, um, so like, Stephanie and I hanged out afterwards.

1274
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:02,240
So at that point, it was like, at that point when I was off of V.

1275
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:34,360
it was midnight I was and I've been trying to like catch up on my sleep debt ever since because of the entire day of that one day of me setting everything up and then trying to do the recording and everything like I was like I'm still trying to catch up my body is still trying to regain itself but now you know why the next day for my I was not a person.

1276
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:45,300
I I was not I was not a person after that because I'm still recovering from from this.

1277
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:49,100
No.

1278
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:58,200
And but yeah, it also didn't help that I threw away my contact lenses the day I got the sponsor too.

1279
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:01,420
So I had to like deal with my glasses as well.

1280
02:02:02,260 --> 02:03:18,900
I was there like couldn't everything was so blurry because I had to like fix my glasses every 10 minutes because it kept like smushing into my eye so because it's smushing to my eye it was like smudging my lenses so I had to like like you know like underneath my my headset I had to like wipe my my glasses and everything every time so so because I didn't have my I had my and it was my first time wearing glasses underneath my headset um uh but also what was really cute was that oh yeah by the way my full body um i had everything uh plugged and like charged and set up for full body tracking but full body did not work i was so sad i was like trying the only parts that worked for my full body um tracking was the waste that is it I think it's just cuz like I think it's because of my shoot my I like I like to call it the shoebox I like I think it's because of the fact that my base station was not mounted properly because like one side was a fucking box the other side was my audio foam so I

1281
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:33,760
feel like it was not tracking very well yeah it was not working so well um Yeah, and then, okay, but yeah, and then like, you know, I was having a breakdown an hour before the recording.

1282
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:35,200
I was literally bawling my eyes.

1283
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,020
I would be like, why would it work?

1284
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:39,480
And I got there and I was like, I'm okay now.

1285
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:43,380
Like, it did not seem like I would cry.

1286
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:49,600
Like, you know, during the recording, like the video footage, I was so, like, I seemed okay.

1287
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:53,660
But literally an hour before the recording, I was like, I wouldn't work.

1288
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,860
I can't, I can't get it to work.

1289
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,840
Why did I take the sponsor?

1290
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:07,620
and then i you know and then everything and then you know 5 p.m i was like i'm okay now i got into the world i was like hey everyone

1291
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:30,230
i like i got into the vr chat room like hey guys i'm ready yes schedule cry that's why i couldn't read the briefing in time too because i got the briefing the day before the recording and obviously like you know i think the day before the recording.

1292
02:04:30,330 --> 02:04:31,210
I was also very tired.

1293
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:32,670
So I went straight to sleep.

1294
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:33,630
I don't remember what was streaming.

1295
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:35,650
I remember I streamed something for a really long time.

1296
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:38,230
But I went, I was so, I think it was like Batman, right?

1297
02:04:38,230 --> 02:04:42,430
So I went to sleep and I woke up and I had to do the Alice game and I had to set up for this.

1298
02:04:42,770 --> 02:04:44,750
So then luckily we didn't do the record.

1299
02:04:44,830 --> 02:04:49,190
The recording was delayed because they had to like import another model.

1300
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:50,790
I think it was for Lumi.

1301
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:53,710
Lumi had to add a model imported again.

1302
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:56,650
So, um, so we were just waiting for that.

1303
02:04:57,410 --> 02:05:03,530
Um, and then because from that, I was just I was like, I was like, oh thank God, I have time to read the briefing.

1304
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:06,870
I was like, and I was like, okay, I'm good now.

1305
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:11,570
I'm good now.

1306
02:05:11,950 --> 02:05:17,850
Also, I was trying to remember how to move in VR because it was, you know, I haven't done VR in so long.

1307
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:21,310
So you can tell like in the beginning of the recording, because we did it all like in order.

1308
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:26,490
So like, it's not like in Hollywood, like, you know, in movies, they film scenes out of order.

1309
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:43,990
So you can tell at the beginning, I didn't know what the fuck to do with my body Because I haven't done like VR chat in a long time Because like motion capture and VR is like different types of like It's different ways like you know motion capture is much more fluid You know,

1310
02:05:43,990 --> 02:07:01,870
you're just moving your body But in VR, you're holding controllers and stuff So it felt I'm trying to like figure out how to move myself And then as it went on, I've like I've got more I felt more like used to moving in VR and stuff But yeah, no that's that's basically the story of everything now you know now now you know that's why I was like no the setup leading to this sponsor was fucking crazy like um I'm not gonna see if there's anything else that I missed out on um but yeah no every oh yeah also like everyone else having technical issues and i was so happy because i was like yay it's not just me i mean it sucks for them that they're having technical issues but like i was like oh thank god i'm not the only one because like headsets were like breaking like we're breaking tracking was breaking as well so i was like oh thank god it's not just me i was so happy like during the filming of the the of the shooting scene,

1311
02:07:02,870 --> 02:07:04,870
I think like Cleo's headset died.

1312
02:07:05,110 --> 02:07:07,730
So she was just like standing man emoji.

1313
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:11,410
And they were like, Cleo, Cleo, are you okay?

1314
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:16,410
Like, it looked like she had like PTSD from the war.

1315
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:21,870
Like, cause she was just like standing man emoji staring to the distance while we were like shooting these robots.

1316
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:25,990
And like we had to, I think you guys don't notice it cause we cut it, I'm pretty sure it got cut out.

1317
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:28,230
And we were just like, are you okay, Cleo?

1318
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:32,010
And we're like waving our hands in front of her face and there was like no response.

1319
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:44,750
And it looked like, you know, that, like, you know that like PTSD soldier, uh, image where he's just like, stares off the distance and like, you know, that drawing of the, the soldier with PTSD, the mild stare.

1320
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:46,710
It basically looked like that.

1321
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:51,690
We're like, are you okay?

1322
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:58,190
And we're like, we should have like, we're like, we should have it in memoriam, like after this and me, like, Cleo.

1323
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:54,170
because we're like if she can't come back and we have like an in memoriam like right after the wave and just cut to that and then like you know she can't come back it would make sense why she's not here like and yeah but luckily she was able to like like charge her headset during that time while we were waiting um so like we didn't have to do that uh but the really cute thing was that the recording um i think like everyone left except for like me and stuffy because we were we were getting ready to hang out and they're like oh can we get photos with you toky and it was really cute the staff asked for photos with me and what i took like i was on at that point i changed forms i changed back to croaky and then i was like i took photos with the staff as croaky like the people were recording everything um but yeah no it was really cute at the end so i took photos with them But yeah,

1324
02:08:54,290 --> 02:08:56,130
no, this is a really fun experience.

1325
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:59,770
I've never had a spot do I never done sponsor like this.

1326
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:04,690
So it was obviously, you know, especially like, you know, I had to sub in like super last minute too.

1327
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:07,750
So it was a very fun experience.

1328
02:09:08,270 --> 02:09:12,530
I've never done it before, like, you know, doing like a VR chat, like acting thing.

1329
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:18,870
Like I was so nervous, especially when, you know, I was just like a substitute too.

1330
02:09:20,110 --> 02:09:22,970
So like I didn't know exactly what we're doing.

1331
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:30,070
I didn't even know the character I was playing until literally they were like, okay, Doki, since you're Rapunzel, you're going to have to heal them.

1332
02:09:30,170 --> 02:09:31,210
And I was like, I'm what?

1333
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,290
Oh, I'm a support.

1334
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:38,810
I didn't even know who I was until after during that scene where you're like, okay, it's time for you to heal them.

1335
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:41,350
So, but I think I did pretty well.

1336
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:43,790
I think I did pretty well.

1337
02:09:43,950 --> 02:09:50,210
And I think I, you know, highlighted the third year anniversary very well for Enike.

1338
02:09:52,970 --> 02:09:58,030
Thank you to Nike for sponsoring me.

1339
02:09:58,350 --> 02:09:59,350
I really appreciate it.

1340
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:07,490
I had a great time doing the recording, despite me having a breakdown before the recording.

1341
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:10,950
I think it was a fun experience.

1342
02:10:11,290 --> 02:10:19,170
Like there were some like technical issues throughout it, but I think like, you know, everyone did the best they could with what we had.

1343
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:30,130
And, you know, it was my first time trying to, Like, you know, it was like one take, you know, so it was like my first time, like, I guess trying to roleplay this in one take, by the way.

1344
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:43,030
And, um, and I had a, you know, like, even when we, um, and I got a lap dance too, so, for my overtime.

1345
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:48,430
Technically, we all got the lap dance, guys, because they only sent that video to us, chat.

1346
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:50,470
So we all got it together.
