1
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,590
Hello, everybody!

2
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,290
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,130
Welcome back, guys, to another day of more Elden Ring!

4
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,010
We're at, like, part seven now.

5
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,010
Oh my gosh, I don't even know how much I have left of Elden Ring, to be fair.

6
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,410
I don't even know how many... it's all blurring together right now.

7
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,830
I don't know how many bosses I've done.

8
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,970
Everything has blurred together.

9
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,090
We've done so many filler episodes.

10
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,610
There were, like, mini bosses.

11
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:21,870
There were, like, I fought... I fought... Birdie... I fought... Boki Bird... and everything.

12
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,330
I've lost track.

13
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,010
There were so many filler episodes!

14
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,650
Okay, but also, like, when I miss a week of, like, any game that, like, I miss a week of, or a playthrough, I also forgot all the controls.

15
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,630
Um, other than, like, R1 and R2, but that's all we need.

16
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,890
Like, to be fair, R2 is all we need in this game.

17
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,530
Or R1.

18
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,330
R1, R2 is all we need.

19
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,550
Um, but yeah, I'm a little tired, uh, because, um, somebody...

20
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,670
Somebody keeps waking me up at five in the morning!

21
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,430
And then, when I'm like, no!

22
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,090
Stop!

23
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,970
And then he wakes me up at six in the morning!

24
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,050
And he's like, is it time yet?

25
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,110
Is it time?

26
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,150
I need, oh my gosh, I need to, like...

27
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,050
I think it's because, like, I've been so weak.

28
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,430
He's like, she's weak.

29
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,570
I can take advantage of her.

30
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:24,170
Because I've been, usually I would try to, like, train him to, like, start eating later and later.

31
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:33,490
But the only issue is that, um, my streams start, like, if I feed him later, uh, for, like, his morning meals.

32
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,610
Um, the thing is, I need to, like, be able to do that also for his, like, dinner as well.

33
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,770
But I can't because I start my stream at five.

34
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,330
Um, so I have to feed him before my stream time.

35
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,830
Um, I need to feed him, like, around four before, before I stream.

36
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,910
So he won't interrupt during my actual stream time.

37
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,870
And because of that, um, you know, if I feed him later in the morning, then he'll want to be fed.

38
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,290
It'll be, it's better for him to be fed later at night.

39
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,310
So then, like, the, uh, the meals.

40
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,690
Um, so then, like, he won't, like, you know, later on, like, it, it will be a better cycle for him.

41
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,510
A better routine.

42
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,330
Versus, like, feeding him later and then feeding him early.

43
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,530
Um, because then he'll get hungry earlier.

44
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,650
So the cycle, it, it will ruin the cycle!

45
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,530
It will...

46
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,510
But he knows, he knows I'm weak right now.

47
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,650
And I've been tired because he keeps waking me up.

48
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,430
He keeps waking me up in the morning.

49
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,290
And then when he wakes me up in the morning, I, I don't get a lot of sleep in the morning because of it.

50
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,810
Um, but also because it's been so long.

51
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,150
I thought it's been, maybe because I've been, like, extra tired lately.

52
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,230
But I haven't been able to stay up past midnight in a long time.

53
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,970
Like, I'm like, no, I, I'm like, it's because, no, I'm not, it's not because I'm getting old.

54
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,670
It's not because I'm getting old, guys.

55
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,450
It's because somebody is ruining my schedule!

56
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,150
And I hate it!

57
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,910
I hate that I can't, can't looking and stay awake past midnight.

58
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,610
I always get so tired after 11, 8, 11 p.m.

59
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,670
I used to be able to stay up till 4 in the morning.

60
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,570
What happened to me?

61
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,710
What happened to me?

62
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,130
Her youthful optimism is gone!

63
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,950
Um...

64
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,450
Anyway, okay.

65
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,970
Uh, enough chitchat.

66
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,590
Not a long, uh, life update today.

67
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,210
Because we did have a long...

68
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,150
Oh yeah, my...

69
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,050
Who would have thought?

70
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,710
My Disney stream, my Epic Mickey stream got demonetized.

71
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,490
Not because of anything I showed on stream!

72
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,770
Mind you.

73
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,670
It was because it had Disney songs in it.

74
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,850
So...

75
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,330
It got...

76
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,210
It got copyright played by Disney songs in my Disney game.

77
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,010
So it was definitely not streamer friendly.

78
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,350
Uh...

79
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,710
Not because of whatever...

80
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,150
All the shit I showed on stream.

81
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,930
All the fucked up stuff I showed on stream.

82
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,650
And the...

83
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,750
And the audio...

84
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,130
And the...

85
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,950
Anime Grok Girl.

86
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,190
No, not that.

87
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,970
But it was because of the music that was in...

88
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,770
In the game.

89
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,410
Uh...

90
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,270
So...

91
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,270
So that's...

92
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,290
So I thought that was funny.

93
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,090
That my...

94
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,830
My Epic Mickey got demonetized.

95
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,650
But that's alright.

96
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,750
Anything...

97
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,430
Anything for...

98
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,870
Like, you know...

99
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,190
Disney needs more money, you know?

100
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,030
Disney...

101
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,870
Disney CEO needs to give itself another bonus retirement check.

102
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,190
You know?

103
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,250
Just like...

104
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,730
What's his name?

105
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,490
The Warner Bros...

106
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,190
Oh my god.

107
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,450
The Warner Bros CEO that gives himself a fucking like...

108
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,590
A million dollar bonus check.

109
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,790
Like Christmas bonus.

110
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,910
Every fucking year.

111
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,530
That's...

112
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,290
And like...

113
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,850
His whole job is to cut...

114
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,330
Like...

115
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:49,690
Like...

116
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,590
Budget the studio.

117
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,310
But yet he gives himself a million dollar Christmas bonus at the end of the year.

118
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:55,950
I...

119
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,130
Like...

120
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,070
Make it make sense.

121
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,710
Like...

122
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,910
Don't...

123
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,450
Don't...

124
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,690
I thought that was like...

125
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,010
Okay.

126
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,610
That's the same guy...

127
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,750
That like...

128
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,650
Um...

129
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,610
I know like...

130
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,170
The Wally Coyote movie.

131
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,770
That's the same guy that like...

132
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,510
Tried to...

133
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:10,910
Uh...

134
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,630
Scrap the Wally Coyote movie for like...

135
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,330
A better tax break for the studio and stuff.

136
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,530
So I was like...

137
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:17,690
Okay.

138
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,430
We gotta do that.

139
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,370
At least like...

140
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,870
You know...

141
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,550
Don't give yourself more money.

142
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,470
It doesn't...

143
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,350
It doesn't make sense.

144
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,310
I don't understand.

145
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,130
I...

146
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,890
Is that the purpose of being a CEO?

147
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,690
Is that...

148
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,730
Is that what it is?

149
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,630
Um...

150
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,390
So I was so...

151
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,410
I was so confused.

152
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,990
I was like...

153
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,330
Oh!

154
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,570
Maybe they need more money.

155
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:39,830
Okay.

156
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,570
That makes sense.

157
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:40,910
You know?

158
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,890
The studio's not doing so well.

159
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,810
They need...

160
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,050
You know...

161
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,050
They're trying to like...

162
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,030
Cut things...

163
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,250
Uh...

164
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,910
So that...

165
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,210
You know...

166
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,690
They can still make more money.

167
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,390
And then like...

168
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,110
Later on...

169
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,630
They're like...

170
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,670
By the way...

171
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,010
This...

172
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,410
He just gave himself a million dollar Christmas bonus.

173
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,190
And I'm like...

174
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,370
What?

175
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,990
What the fuck was the point of...

176
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,910
Trying to help the studio...

177
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,430
Like...

178
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,890
Budget themselves.

179
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,970
What the fuck?

180
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,670
You're not...

181
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,010
Are you not part of the budget?

182
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,630
Are...

183
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,950
Are you not part of the whole budget system that they're trying to do?

184
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,990
Uh...

185
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,230
That guy...

186
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,030
He needs that new...

187
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,870
Doki...

188
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,790
Want someone...

189
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,250
Please...

190
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,290
Think of the million...

191
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,710
Billion dollar CEO's.

192
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,490
Please...

193
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,730
It's so hard...

194
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,390
Being a...

195
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,170
Fucking...

196
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,470
Billion dollar CEO...

197
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,190
Of a billion dollar company.

198
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,750
It's so...

199
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,050
Fucking hard...

200
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,670
Doki...

201
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,890
Why won't you think about...

202
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,010
The...

203
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:32,890
The CEO's.

204
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,430
It's so hard to have so much money.

205
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,730
How else will he pay for all his mistresses?

206
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:41,810
Doki...

207
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,010
How...

208
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,150
I'm playing my tiny violin.

209
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,950
Leave the billion dollar CEO alone Doki!

210
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,670
What has he done to you?

211
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,950
Anyway...

212
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,350
Um...

213
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,750
Let's play some Elden Ring.

214
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,370
Think of the babes Doki!

215
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,350
Will someone please...

216
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,010
Think of the hot babes!

217
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,010
Uh...

218
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,170
Uh...

219
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,210
Uh...

220
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,950
Uh...

221
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,630
And it's 15 children!

222
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,310
That he clearly...

223
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:15,690
Uh...

224
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,170
Is gonna nepo them into success!

225
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,250
Oh!

226
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,910
Won't somebody think of the nepo babies?

227
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,830
Please Doki!

228
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,370
Uh...

229
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,630
Uh...

230
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,330
Uh...

231
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:26,610
Uh...

232
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,490
Uh...

233
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:27,530
Uh...

234
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,170
I...

235
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:28,370
I...

236
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,470
I...

237
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,110
Uh...

238
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,950
Uh...

239
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,430
How will those children grow up?

240
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,310
Stop, Toki.

241
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,030
Oh my god, you want them to go to public school, you monster!

242
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,290
What did I walk into?

243
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,810
Oh, just, you know.

244
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,090
How the world is today.

245
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,030
Stop, I can only love my Oshi so much.

246
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,290
Alright, let's go play some Elden Ring.

247
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,750
Uh, okay, let's see.

248
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,270
Elden Ring with my zero death run, guys.

249
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:20,470
You don't understand his emotional distress after having to fire 500 more low-wage employees.

250
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,010
Guys, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

251
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:30,450
Oh yes, I definitely don't understand because I'm pretty sure he's not even the one doing the firing, too.

252
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,750
I appreciate, like, he hires someone to do...

253
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,610
Because, like, I know a lot of companies actually outsource their firing because they don't want to deal with, you know, being responsible to ruining someone's life.

254
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,590
Like, so...

255
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:50,330
But, sometimes, um, some companies actually, like, uh, outsource their firings.

256
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,310
Yeah, there's, like, companies that will do it for you.

257
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,270
So, like, they...

258
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,330
They take the...

259
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,330
They basically, uh, do all the firings for them and act as, like, the face of it.

260
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,550
So, like, they don't have...

261
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,190
They don't have to feel, like, guilt of firing people themselves.

262
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,870
Um, or be like, sorry, I know we just, like, celebrated your birthday and everything, but, like, we're gonna have to...

263
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,090
Um, and, like, you just, uh, um, got a mortgage, uh, for your new home.

264
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,810
Um, thinking that you're gonna work in this company for, like, maybe, like, uh, seven more years.

265
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,370
Uh, but we're gonna have to let you go.

266
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,270
What is he barking at?

267
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,110
Okay, he must have heard something outside.

268
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,630
Um, Mr. Broken Bomb, thank you for the super chat.

269
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,390
Thank you, thank you.

270
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,190
How else will the CEOs keep their yard afloat, Doki?

271
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,230
How else?

272
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,830
Should I do...

273
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,450
Okay, it should be boardless window, yeah.

274
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,150
Okay, I need to remember how to play this game, guys.

275
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,030
Give me a sec.

276
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,270
Okay, this is where I killed that guy.

277
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,190
Okay, and that's where I accidentally drank the thing.

278
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,410
Okay.

279
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm trying to remember how to play this game, guys.

280
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,950
Okay, run.

281
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,830
Okay, I- I accidentally drank again.

282
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,650
Hahaha!

283
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,470
Okay.

284
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,630
Okay, that's how you run.

285
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:04,950
Okay.

286
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,070
That's fine.

287
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,030
Alright.

288
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,910
And then...

289
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,490
Alright.

290
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:13,970
And then...

291
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,630
Okay, there you go.

292
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,330
Okay, we wanna do it.

293
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,810
Alright.

294
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,230
Alright, figured it out, guys.

295
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,770
Where have I been?

296
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,590
Visioned a friend.

297
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,230
Who's friend?

298
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,490
Where friend at?

299
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,070
I don't know where to go.

300
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,090
Why are there so many dead bodies around me?

301
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,670
What happened?

302
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,410
I haven't been here for too long.

303
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,570
Oh, holy grease.

304
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,510
Oh, nice.

305
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,110
Why did so many people die?

306
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,920
Uh, golden.

307
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,040
Thank you for the super chat.

308
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,440
Thank you.

309
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,200
Thank you.

310
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,260
Praise the Elden Ring.

311
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,100
Let's see...

312
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,440
Dung ahead?

313
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,980
The hoodie?

314
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,940
The hoodie's a tomato.

315
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,640
It's me.

316
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm wearing the skin suit of my skin suit.

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,340
Of my actual skin.

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,540
Where the fuck do I go?

319
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,460
Oh, death counter.

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,860
Sorry.

321
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,260
I knew I forgot something.

322
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
Give me a sec.

323
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,340
Let me grab...

324
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,220
The death counter real fast.

325
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,840
I think it's here.

326
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,640
Yeah, there it is.

327
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,540
My zero deaths.

328
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,940
Clearly.

329
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,760
Oh my god.

330
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,560
Alright.

331
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,500
Alright.

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,460
I have no idea where to go.

333
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm so lost.

334
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Oh dear.

335
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,800
Visions of...

336
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,580
Praise the message and then behold something incredible.

337
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay, liar.

338
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,720
Oh wait, there's another area here.

339
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,040
I didn't go this way, right?

340
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,580
I came from here.

341
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,080
Oh, there's a witch!

342
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,900
Hello, witch!

343
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,760
Good luck!

344
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:03,980
Lost?

345
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,620
Oh wait, no.

346
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,440
That's not a witch.

347
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,340
Oh no, I came from...

348
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,400
Oh my gosh, I'm so lost.

349
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,620
I came from here!

350
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,660
So that means that this is a new area that I have yet to go.

351
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,820
If only I had something.

352
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,800
Alright, here we go.

353
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,740
We figured it out.

354
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,860
It only took us a while.

355
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,310
Alright.

356
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,370
Alright.

357
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,150
I was pissed.

358
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,170
I can't use it.

359
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,750
I thought...

360
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,650
Ok, to be fair it didn't look.

361
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,530
I thought, I thought this was...

362
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,930
I thought this was like...

363
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,470
I don't know, I thought there was a floor there.

364
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,770
I thought there was a floor...

365
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,010
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

366
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,510
It was the fucking depths of hell.

367
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,690
Alright, let's see how much I can mine the gap.

368
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,110
I don't know.

369
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,810
I thought it was a floor.

370
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:16,810
You know?

371
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,730
I thought it was a child... not like a... like a child bannister.

372
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,510
I'm gonna keep the children out.

373
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:25,630
Okay.

374
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,150
Uh, fell for the bit, right?

375
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,010
Buddy, thank you for the super chat.

376
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,370
Thank you.

377
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,470
Thank you, Sajun.

378
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,170
Thank you for the sticker.

379
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:33,790
Thank you.

380
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,530
Thank you.

381
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,130
Do I have enough?

382
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,930
Do I have any?

383
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,770
Oh, I don't.

384
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,370
Oh, I used it all up.

385
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,590
I was gonna say, do I have any special orbs?

386
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,970
Okay, well, now we know.

387
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,050
We can go this way.

388
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,070
Still no hidden path.

389
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:54,890
Okay.

390
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,470
How about this way?

391
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,890
At least I look cool.

392
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,510
Hidden path ahead.

393
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,230
Oh, nice.

394
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,670
Okay, he's a liar.

395
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:07,770
Okay.

396
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,670
Nor.

397
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,510
What?

398
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,870
That's a good thing.

399
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,710
Good.

400
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,350
Okay, my turn.

401
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,960
My turn.

402
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,230
Alright, remember to also appraise this message.

403
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,830
Okay.

404
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,470
It's time to spread the truth.

405
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,370
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

406
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,530
It's the truth and nothing but the truth.

407
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,710
It's the truth.

408
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,370
Alright, down we go.

409
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,970
Anything here?

410
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,810
Oh my God, they're too good at this.

411
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,190
They're too fucking good at this.

412
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,430
What is this?

413
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,650
Elden Ring?

414
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,890
Oh, Elden Ring.

415
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,050
Romeo... Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your golden hair.

416
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,170
Alright, there's a dog ahead here.

417
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,990
Poor dog.

418
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,910
Poor dog at.

419
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,930
Oh my god, where am I anyway?

420
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,430
Oh, that's where the dragon is.

421
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,130
I came from there.

422
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,330
Oh, hey.

423
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,410
Oh, I ran past these guys.

424
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,710
They're playing a little song.

425
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,550
Oh, there's a lot of dead bodies here.

426
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:11,850
Why?

427
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,090
Oh my god, he's fucking floating!

428
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,870
We killed him!

429
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,850
They picked him up!

430
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,430
Wait, he got picked up!

431
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,630
Look at him!

432
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,610
Oh my god, he's like...

433
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,890
Look at the fucking slam dunk on this guy!

434
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,450
It's a secret.

435
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,870
You're gonna find out soon, Doki.

436
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,470
Don't worry.

437
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,950
It'll be your turn soon.

438
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,650
Right?

439
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,110
What?

440
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,910
Try that.

441
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,370
Oh my god, you fuckers.

442
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,130
You...

443
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,890
You fuckers.

444
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,630
You fuckers.

445
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,750
Alright.

446
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,130
Where is this?

447
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,990
Center.

448
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,570
We have fun here.

449
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,470
We have fun here and out there.

450
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,250
Could this be an item?

451
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,070
What?

452
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,830
What does that mean?

453
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:37,990
What?

454
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,440
The trifecta is finally complete.

455
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,890
What does he mean by that?

456
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,870
What?

457
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,600
I don't know.

458
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,280
I don't know what he wants from me.

459
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,740
I'll never know what picked him up.

460
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh!

461
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,980
Now I know.

462
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,180
Oh my god, he's slowly walking up towards me.

463
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,680
What's he gonna do?

464
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,440
Oh wait.

465
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:16,920
That.

466
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,560
Boom!

467
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,120
That's right.

468
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,580
Wait.

469
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,680
There's no way that guy picked him up.

470
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,660
Look at him.

471
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,480
Tree.

472
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,280
He can't pick nobody up.

473
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,640
Lump sort.

474
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,720
Look at these guys.

475
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,660
They're so weak.

476
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,440
Sage, thank you for the super chat.

477
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,340
Thank you.

478
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,240
Whenever Doki leaves a message on the ground in the elderly, I can't help but think.

479
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,320
I totally swear.

480
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,600
I'm up to no good.

481
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,320
Thank you for the super chat.

482
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,760
Thank you.

483
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,420
Thank you.

484
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,480
Wait.

485
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,160
There's a lot more.

486
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,600
Wait.

487
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,220
Why is there a lot more?

488
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,480
Oh my god.

489
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,860
There's so many more.

490
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,780
Where did they all...

491
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,560
Where did they all die from?

492
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,180
Night ahead?

493
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Oh.

494
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,770
How did you die?

495
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,670
Wait.

496
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,030
Why did that thing look at me?

497
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,470
Oh!

498
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,570
Oh my god!

499
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:30,910
It's him!

500
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,450
It's him!

501
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,050
It's him!

502
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,090
Wait.

503
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:35,470
No.

504
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,430
Oh my god.

505
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:36,750
It's him.

506
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,410
It's him.

507
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,750
It's him.

508
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,030
Oh my god!

509
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,550
It's him!

510
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,330
It's him!

511
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,130
It's him!

512
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,270
Oh my god!

513
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,950
The only way I killed them was through gravity.

514
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,250
I can't do that again!

515
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,430
I don't have gravity again!

516
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,730
It's him!

517
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,090
Okay.

518
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,750
Okay.

519
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,390
Okay, now I know how he... how everyone died.

520
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,950
It's okay.

521
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,050
Okay, I got an idea.

522
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,190
I got an idea.

523
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,490
Guys, it's a very funny idea.

524
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,350
No, no, no, I got this.

525
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,630
I know what to do.

526
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,290
Now I know where all these bloodstains come from.

527
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:35,530
Now... I thought you could do the thing.

528
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,550
I thought you could backstab.

529
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,230
I thought you could backstab.

530
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,990
I was wrong.

531
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,090
I was wrong.

532
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,650
Is he coming after me?

533
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,550
Okay, he doesn't know.

534
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,310
Okay, is he still coming after me?

535
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,870
Okay, he's just walking over.

536
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,010
So, like... Oh my god, he is.

537
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,390
Oh my god!

538
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,850
Okay, I'm just gonna run ahead.

539
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,090
He's walking to me menacingly.

540
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,770
Wait, what's all this?

541
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,330
What is all this?

542
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,930
Oh, is it like a magic thing?

543
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,170
What is that?

544
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,370
What is this?

545
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,350
Wait, what is this thing?

546
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,150
Oh!

547
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,450
Oh, it is a bear.

548
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:45,710
Okay.

549
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,590
I was like, what is this thing that's just...

550
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,130
Wait!

551
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,450
Wait a minute.

552
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,590
Oh my god.

553
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,270
Wait, where do I go?

554
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,410
What?

555
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,470
This is a dead end.

556
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,330
Wait, what?

557
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,410
What?

558
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,190
This is... Oh my god, no.

559
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,310
Oh my god, no.

560
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,290
He...

561
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,890
Fuck.

562
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,770
Down?

563
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,870
Oh, down.

564
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,010
Down.

565
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:16,630
Here.

566
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,910
Wait.

567
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,680
Down?

568
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,920
No.

569
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,540
No.

570
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:28,980
No.

571
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,080
Okay.

572
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:29,620
No.

573
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,320
Wait.

574
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,700
Not there.

575
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,540
No.

576
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,660
Toki, stop!

577
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,420
Like, I'm looking, I'm like...

578
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:38,880
Down?

579
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,420
Down?

580
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,360
Do I do it?

581
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Take the...

582
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,500
Take the jump, Toki.

583
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,660
Do a flip.

584
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,400
Down?

585
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,440
Where the fuck do I go?

586
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,800
On the spe...

587
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,000
What the fuck is a spear?

588
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,490
There's a spear?

589
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,010
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

590
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,470
There's nothing that looks like a spear.

591
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,130
Anywhere on this map.

592
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,970
Spear, man.

593
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,330
Oh, that?

594
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,890
That thing over there?

595
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,250
How the fuck do I get there?

596
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,290
A tree branch?

597
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,030
There's a tree?

598
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:42,770
Oh, that?

599
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,070
How the fuck do I get up there?

600
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,610
Oh my god, he's looking at me.

601
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,400
You think he knows?

602
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,040
Oh, he doesn't.

603
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,940
Why the fuck am I here?

604
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,080
This is like a dead end.

605
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,100
I think I can take him.

606
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,360
Oh my god!

607
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,650
Don't worry.

608
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,030
Watch this.

609
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,970
Oh fuck.

610
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,630
Oh fuck.

611
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,730
Oh fuck.

612
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,290
Oh.

613
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:31,930
Wait, no, no, no, wait.

614
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,910
I can't take him though.

615
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,310
I can't take him.

616
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,610
I can absolutely take this guy.

617
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,590
Halfway.

618
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,690
I got halfway.

619
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,510
Wait, he can fly?

620
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,120
Nobody told me.

621
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Oh my god.

622
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,520
Nobody told me he can fly.

623
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,180
Oh my god.

624
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,960
I'm out of my groove.

625
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,820
I'm out of my groove now.

626
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,640
I'm not...

627
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,780
Okay.

628
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,500
Okay.

629
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,220
But I was grooving though.

630
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,620
Oh no.

631
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,080
No!

632
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,580
No!

633
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,540
That's the thing!

634
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,310
I'm out of my groove.

635
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,410
He got me out of my groove.

636
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,390
I swear to god, I was grooving.

637
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,490
I was...

638
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,750
I was grooving, guys.

639
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,190
I was doing so well.

640
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,050
I was doing so well, I swear to god.

641
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,790
I swear to god, I was doing really well earlier.

642
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,890
Guys, you saw it.

643
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,170
You all saw it.

644
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,750
You all saw it.

645
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,580
You all saw it.

646
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,520
Flawless run.

647
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,860
Right there.

648
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Flawless.

649
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,980
I was... I was gaming.

650
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,180
I was... I was gaming.

651
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,080
The spear.

652
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,200
Oh, shit.

653
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,020
Goodbye.

654
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:37,820
Alright.

655
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,760
We got it.

656
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,460
Alright, here we go.

657
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,460
Yeah, but I'm not gonna use it.

658
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,100
I'll pick it up for you guys, but I'm not gonna use it.

659
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,200
I got all... I got the katana.

660
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
I got anime.

661
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,740
Got it by my side.

662
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,870
Oh, I... Do I jump from there?

663
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,730
Yeah, but this is more anime.

664
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,880
Alright, actually, I wanna go to the grays first before anything.

665
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,540
Wait.

666
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

667
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,280
Does... Does the guy come back?

668
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,860
Does this guy come back?

669
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,620
Chat?

670
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,980
I need to know.

671
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,240
He doesn't?

672
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,280
Okay, do I jump here?

673
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,520
Wait, here?

674
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:39,980
Here?

675
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,190
Did I make that?

676
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,340
What?

677
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,940
Oh, my God.

678
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,600
Can I even get past this?

679
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,760
Oh, my God.

680
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,280
Okay, okay.

681
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,840
We did it.

682
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,880
We did it.

683
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,020
Nothing to worry about.

684
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,220
I was trying to figure out how...

685
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,320
Oh, my God.

686
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,740
Oh, my God.

687
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,100
Okay.

688
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,730
Everything is okay.

689
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,550
And here.

690
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,990
Now, where do I go?

691
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,150
Wait, where the fuck am I?

692
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,010
I don't know.

693
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,650
I'll go down.

694
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,640
Where is this place?

695
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,610
Oh, my God.

696
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,770
Oh, my God.

697
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,550
Oh, my God.

698
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,890
Oh, my God.

699
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,230
Please.

700
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,590
Oh, my God.

701
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:50,930
Please.

702
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,510
Oh, my God.

703
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,530
They all came down for me.

704
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,030
Oh, my God.

705
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,010
They all came down for me.

706
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,570
Oh, my God.

707
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,010
Why did they all come down for me?

708
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,910
Where am I?

709
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,820
Okay.

710
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, they're all here.

711
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,960
They're all here.

712
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,880
They're all...

713
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,080
Oh, my God.

714
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,290
I came to the wrong area.

715
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,890
I came to the wrong area.

716
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,590
This is the wrong place to be.

717
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,590
Get me... Oh my god.

718
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,270
Get me out of... Oh my god.

719
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,070
Can I... Oh my god.

720
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,750
They're all here.

721
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,210
They're all here for me.

722
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,810
This has to be a grace.

723
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,410
Oh, there's this.

724
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,590
This is my grace.

725
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,870
I came to the wrong neighborhood.

726
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,510
Okay, we're fine.

727
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,490
We're fine.

728
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,070
Everything is fine.

729
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,590
Alright.

730
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,050
Okay, so where do I go now?

731
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,370
I don't know where to go.

732
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,170
I'm so lost.

733
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,310
Go back to my other grace.

734
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,810
What was it?

735
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,690
Was it here?

736
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,070
The sanctuary?

737
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,990
Is this the... Okay, yeah.

738
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,990
This is the giant room.

739
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:13,310
Alright.

740
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,570
Now where do I go, guys?

741
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,940
Up the tree branch.

742
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,180
Oh, this tree branch.

743
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,560
I see a tree branch here.

744
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,220
Oh!

745
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,420
More trees.

746
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,160
Alright, here.

747
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,620
I'll go.

748
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,320
Then I'm up here.

749
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,820
Then I go this way.

750
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,120
So many dead people.

751
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,240
Why did they all die?

752
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,580
Who's that lady over here?

753
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,540
Friendly?

754
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,340
Not friendly.

755
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,140
Not friendly.

756
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:00,860
Not friendly.

757
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,480
Not...

758
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,220
Okay.

759
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,520
I know he's not friendly now.

760
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,400
Okay, I need to...

761
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,580
Oh my god.

762
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,780
Oh my god.

763
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,060
Okay, he cancelled my heals.

764
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,640
Holy shit.

765
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,420
Okay, we're fine.

766
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,560
Oh, we're not fine.

767
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,040
We're not fine.

768
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,200
I cannot be greedy.

769
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,740
It's fine.

770
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,760
I got my one heal off.

771
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,460
Alright.

772
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,460
I don't know.

773
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,340
Sometimes I...

774
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
I thought, you know...

775
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,300
Sometimes they want to be my friend.

776
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,220
You know?

777
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,560
Didn't expect a percentage.

778
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,440
Sorry.

779
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,680
Oh, maybe.

780
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,320
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

781
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,080
I got an idea.

782
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,700
I got an idea.

783
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,260
I got an idea.

784
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:01,830
Okay.

785
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,230
Remember to praise...

786
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,510
This message.

787
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,170
Next to the fucking blood state.

788
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,950
And they'll be like...

789
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,350
Wait, if that's a friend...

790
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,050
How did they die here?

791
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,890
How...

792
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,650
Wait a minute.

793
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:25,930
How did...

794
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,950
There's so many bloodstains here.

795
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,530
That guy ahead of us is friend.

796
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,110
Oh, that's weird.

797
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,550
How did so many people die here?

798
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,180
Yeah.

799
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
This friend will help us with the next boss.

800
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:42,800
Alright.

801
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,080
What do we get to next, guys?

802
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,860
Vigor.

803
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,080
Endurance.

804
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,360
Dexterity.

805
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,180
Arcane.

806
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,000
Which one?

807
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,440
Oh, it's a PvP spot?

808
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,240
Thank god.

809
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,860
We don't...

810
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,300
We never did any PvP.

811
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,280
Still have arcane.

812
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,240
So I do arcane.

813
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:09,960
Alright.

814
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,040
Okay.

815
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,760
Blessings.

816
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,640
Okay.

817
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,440
We got the blessings.

818
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,760
Alright.

819
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,220
Let's go.

820
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,900
What the fuck?

821
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Already another boss fight?

822
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,100
I literally just got here.

823
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,120
How do I get another boss fight?

824
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,090
Check the spear?

825
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,390
But I like my...

826
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,690
I like my katanas.

827
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,930
Where is this...

828
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,950
spear anyway?

829
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,260
To this one?

830
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,660
Oh, I can't even wield it.

831
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,320
I don't...

832
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,300
I'm not strong enough.

833
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
I'm too fucking weak.

834
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,540
Bro, I can't even hold a torch.

835
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,060
That's how weak I am.

836
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,820
I...

837
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,180
I can't even hold...

838
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,820
Oh, I can too...

839
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,620
I was like...

840
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,940
My weak noodle arms.

841
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,160
Alright.

842
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I'll look at it.

843
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,440
Wait.

844
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,720
Unable with present...

845
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,120
Bro, I can't even hold it.

846
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm too weak.

847
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,460
Let's see.

848
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,360
Boom.

849
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,640
My noodle arms...

850
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,540
Can't even hold this spear properly.

851
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,660
Alright.

852
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,160
Let's scroll...

853
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,940
Why do I...

854
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,740
Remove the area.

855
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,520
Alright.

856
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,040
Here we go.

857
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,900
We're gonna die.

858
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,460
Most likely.

859
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,000
Oh, hey.

860
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,340
Who is she?

861
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,320
What's this?

862
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:53,600
Wait.

863
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:53,780
Sorry.

864
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,380
I got text.

865
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,980
I got spam text.

866
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,200
It's like...

867
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,490
Regarding your...

868
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,880
Outstanding balance...

869
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,560
A resolution is available.

870
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,660
What the fuck is this?

871
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,460
It's like...

872
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,160
I owed money.

873
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm like...

874
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,180
What?

875
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,820
My

876
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,120
maiden!

877
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,260
Alright.

878
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,480
Come with me.

879
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,320
Come with me, my maiden.

880
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,240
We will be the husband and wife duo.

881
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,180
Together.

882
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,380
Come over here.

883
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,920
There you go.

884
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,200
Come over here.

885
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,180
We shall be a husband and wife duo.

886
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,380
It will be beautiful.

887
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,580
Let's go.

888
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,680
A story for the ages.

889
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,240
No, no, no.

890
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,500
She is my current wife.

891
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,340
We're gonna have lots of beautiful kids together.

892
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,060
The power duo.

893
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,500
We are the power couple.

894
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,020
Romeo and Juliet.

895
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,060
And they lived happily ever after.

896
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,300
I never saw the...

897
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,660
I assume they do.

898
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,500
Who is he?

899
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,080
Oh, wait.

900
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,300
That's the guy that like...

901
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,960
Like, did the magic trick on the person.

902
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,380
I know Melania.

903
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,510
General Bredan.

904
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,610
I killed him.

905
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,930
Praetor Reichard.

906
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,490
Luna Princess Rani.

907
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,040
Willful traitors.

908
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,420
What?

909
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,640
Thy kind are all of a piece.

910
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
What makes you better than them, huh?

911
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,240
Look at you.

912
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,780
You fell off, bro.

913
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,860
Pillagers.

914
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,900
Emboldened by the flame of ambition.

915
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,200
His voice is hot as fuck.

916
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,820
Heard rid of all my neither grave.

917
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,580
You deserve better.

918
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,100
Felled by King Morgoth.

919
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,480
Last of all.

920
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,120
Oh my god.

921
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,800
He's like two sizes.

922
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,400
Of me.

923
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,960
All right.

924
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,960
Oh my god.

925
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,380
Okay.

926
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,120
Okay.

927
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,220
Okay.

928
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,620
Where's my wife?

929
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,940
Where's my wife?

930
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,320
Holy shit.

931
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,320
Oh my.

932
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,820
I'm so confused.

933
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,160
Oh.

934
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,500
Where's my wife?

935
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,300
Melania.

936
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,160
Please.

937
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,500
I do shit.

938
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,440
Holy shit.

939
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,340
It's fine.

940
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
Jellyfish time.

941
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,000
My real wife.

942
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,200
I'm like.

943
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,980
Oh my god.

944
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,920
I'm panic rolling.

945
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,160
I don't know his patterns.

946
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,820
I don't know his patterns.

947
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:41,940
Okay.

948
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,620
I'm just.

949
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,320
Just take everything I guess.

950
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,720
I guess that's my strat.

951
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,100
Holy shit.

952
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,500
Oh.

953
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,940
I thought he was aiming for her.

954
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,600
Nice.

955
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,960
That's fucking right.

956
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,120
That's right.

957
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,840
Confuse.

958
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,840
That is not right.

959
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,100
Okay.

960
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,500
That's okay.

961
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,660
All right.

962
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,080
That's fine.

963
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,170
All right.

964
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,520
At least he's poisoned.

965
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,960
I don't want to be full healed.

966
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,360
I don't know.

967
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,440
I don't trust myself.

968
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,500
It's okay.

969
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:47,840
My.

970
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,980
My two wives.

971
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,420
My two wives got this.

972
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,200
My two wives.

973
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,520
You guys got this.

974
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,600
Okay.

975
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,140
I'm scared.

976
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,240
It's

977
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:19,600
okay.

978
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,700
I think that can fix you.

979
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,800
I saw wife number two.

980
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,120
It's fine.

981
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,180
It's okay.

982
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:28,320
It's okay.

983
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:28,660
My lady.

984
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,080
She'll get better.

985
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:31,820
She'll.

986
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,240
She'll.

987
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,000
She'll.

988
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,540
She'll heal.

989
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,680
Oh my god.

990
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,120
Oh my god.

991
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

992
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:48,080
No, no, no, no... No, no, no... No, no, no, no... No, no, no, no, no... No, no, no, no... Yo...

993
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,660
Me and my two wives did it.

994
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,380
Oh, shit, did I call her out by her wrong name?

995
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,140
Oh, shit, It's okay.

996
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,100
She doesn't know that.

997
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,020
Oh my god, he's so small now.

998
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,000
Look at him.

999
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,540
Wife gone.

1000
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,800
Think about wife.

1001
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,420
Oh my god, look how small he is.

1002
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,880
Oh my god, he's so skinny.

1003
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,900
Look at him.

1004
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,180
Oh my god.

1005
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,980
He was not working on his arm game, that's for sure.

1006
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,620
Miss wife.

1007
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,660
Bird tree wards off all who Dane approach.

1008
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,980
We are, we are all forsaken.

1009
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,580
He was wearing like platform shoes, that's why it made him look so big.

1010
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,460
Time to keep...

1011
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,180
Oh sorry, my wife and my child, okay?

1012
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:17,640
I'm like, how fuck was I supposed to know that jellyfish was now?

1013
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,060
Like, look how big she is!

1014
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,220
Okay, my wife and my child, all right?

1015
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,200
All right, let's see, there she is!

1016
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
There she is, officer!

1017
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,020
What did I do?!

1018
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,020
All right, let's see.

1019
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,580
We go up now.

1020
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,020
That was pretty easy.

1021
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:50,560
That was pretty easy.

1022
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,120
Offer seed.

1023
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,620
First off, well done.

1024
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,040
Victory!

1025
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,060
First off, but, and then don't give up.

1026
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,000
Yay!

1027
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,120
They're all congratulating me and my family!

1028
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,360
Yay!

1029
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,940
All right, where is it?

1030
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,220
Where's my favorite thing?

1031
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,940
Where is it?

1032
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,520
Where is...

1033
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,060
Weak foe?

1034
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,180
Where is it?

1035
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,280
Oh, it's an enemies.

1036
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,360
Okay, I got an idea.

1037
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,900
Wait, I got an idea.

1038
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,000
Where's his body?

1039
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,600
Where's your fucking body?

1040
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,520
All right.

1041
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,520
Okay, and then...

1042
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,470
Uh...

1043
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,650
Oh, wait!

1044
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,410
Sitting sideways!

1045
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,950
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1046
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:13,410
Okay.

1047
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,830
Oh my god, pointing downward.

1048
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:22,670
Oh my...

1049
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:23,270
That's so good.

1050
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,130
That's so good.

1051
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:24,650
Right here.

1052
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,350
Here we go.

1053
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,670
First try.

1054
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,570
Point down, not the point down.

1055
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:45,650
Perfect.

1056
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,010
Weak ass foe.

1057
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,070
Door.

1058
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,130
You don't have to write.

1059
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,590
Oh, you don't have to write.

1060
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,850
None in Pentro Forest refuse all.

1061
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,730
Wait, but I...

1062
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,350
What?!

1063
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,510
But I did it!

1064
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,370
I killed him!

1065
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,790
How do I...

1066
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,230
What do you mean?!

1067
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,690
I literally killed this man!

1068
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:07,950
Let me through!

1069
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,570
Oh, I didn't press the grace.

1070
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,780
Okay, wait.

1071
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,330
Wait, what?

1072
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,560
Oh, I can't kill him.

1073
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,640
None may claim the title of elder lord.

1074
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,730
Thy deeds shall be met with failure.

1075
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,150
Just as I.

1076
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh.

1077
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,640
I just touched the grace?

1078
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,140
If I touch grace, what if he comes back alive?

1079
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,010
I swear to god, if he comes back alive, I swear to him.

1080
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,780
Oh, shit.

1081
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,040
Hey!

1082
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,480
I told you I didn't kill her!

1083
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,420
Hello again.

1084
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,060
I told you she's alive!

1085
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,040
My wife!

1086
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,100
Allow me a moment to converse with you.

1087
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,880
You are unable to enter the Erd Tree.

1088
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:35,860
No?

1089
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,060
Prevented by the mantle of barbs.

1090
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,540
The thorns are impenetrable.

1091
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:41,960
Yeah.

1092
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,300
A husk of the Erd Tree's being.

1093
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,500
That spurns all that exists without.

1094
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,220
That's my wife.

1095
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,280
I told you she didn't die.

1096
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,520
And become the Elden Hall.

1097
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,540
I just started our little, like, nicknames for each other.

1098
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,740
She's like, I'll call you friend, and that's it.

1099
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,800
And I'll be like, oh, you're so silly, wife.

1100
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:09,200
So I'd like you to undertake a new journey with me to the flame of ruin.

1101
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,600
Far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.

1102
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:25,580
Then, I can set the Erd Tree aflame and guide you down the path to becoming Elden Hall.

1103
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,540
Oh my god, and then you'll be my queen, right?

1104
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,040
You'll be my consort, right?

1105
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,040
Right?

1106
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,840
Shall I turn your runes to strong...

1107
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,740
Oh my god, you want me to...

1108
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,120
Hold my hand.

1109
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,880
Oh my god.

1110
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,700
Oh my god.

1111
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,240
We're on third base.

1112
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,460
Your thoughts.

1113
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,140
Oh!

1114
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,140
My thoughts.

1115
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,700
The principles you would follow.

1116
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,320
See?

1117
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,500
Look at that, guys.

1118
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,240
Would a friend do that?

1119
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,880
All right.

1120
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,980
All right, guys.

1121
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,260
What next?

1122
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,850
What do we do next?

1123
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,730
Oh my god, guys.

1124
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,410
Guys, I gotta censor the hand-holding.

1125
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,610
HP, vigor, endurance...

1126
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,090
Uh...

1127
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,150
Dexterity...

1128
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,490
Arcane...

1129
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:28,830
HP?

1130
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,050
All right, we'll do HP.

1131
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,110
Oh, I could do one HP, and then we could do something else, too.

1132
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:34,710
And endurance next?

1133
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,950
Okay, we don't need strength, though.

1134
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:37,610
Isn't...

1135
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,310
Isn't my build for dexterity?

1136
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,700
Okay, we don't need faith.

1137
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,460
We don't need to believe.

1138
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,000
Arcane?

1139
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,180
Do I do another arcane?

1140
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:10,550
Uh...

1141
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,970
Use best dexterity weapons?

1142
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,550
So, do I...

1143
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,670
Do I do strength, then?

1144
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,670
But I'm not gonna use the spear.

1145
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,990
I'm gonna use the katanas.

1146
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,430
I like the katanas.

1147
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,340
Arcane or...

1148
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,340
Okay, I can do another...

1149
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,180
More vigor.

1150
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,840
Strength's still good?

1151
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:40,480
Okay.

1152
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,540
Believe in us, I believe in you.

1153
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,120
We do believe in her, right?

1154
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,160
Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

1155
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,340
Thank you, thank you.

1156
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,720
All right, uh...

1157
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,260
Okay, I'll do one strength, then.

1158
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,120
All right.

1159
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,540
Nice.

1160
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,260
We should find some more churches later.

1161
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I feel like...

1162
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,440
I feel like maybe my heels are not that strong.

1163
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,020
Why, he disappeared?

1164
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:06,600
No!

1165
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,000
How would my message make sense now?

1166
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,900
No!

1167
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,900
Why did you disappear?

1168
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,960
Now my message makes no sense.

1169
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,860
I'm mad!

1170
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,280
Here, that...

1171
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,420
Where do I have to go next?

1172
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,830
I guess they...

1173
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,350
Here, right?

1174
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,010
All right, what's this?

1175
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,250
The road...

1176
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:40,350
Road?

1177
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,310
Is that where to go next?

1178
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,920
Is it that?

1179
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,480
Oh, okay.

1180
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,980
It's this.

1181
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,630
Okay, so...

1182
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,090
Go to the middle of the area?

1183
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,470
What?

1184
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,270
What do you mean?

1185
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,480
Is there anything else here?

1186
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,820
Nothing else here.

1187
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,740
All right.

1188
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,860
Oh, so many people died here.

1189
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,060
Fucking weak.

1190
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,840
Skill issue.

1191
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,800
Okay.

1192
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,370
Then I guess I'll go...

1193
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,020
Here.

1194
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:50,800
Is it here?

1195
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,480
Where even am I, anyway?

1196
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,140
Yeah, here.

1197
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,080
Okay.

1198
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,530
Will I be able to get over...

1199
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,230
No, I can't.

1200
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:12,950
Main Street.

1201
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,390
It's in the center?

1202
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,210
What's...

1203
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,010
Which is the center?

1204
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,130
Wrong way?

1205
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,590
Which one is it?

1206
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:26,930
The Capital Rampire?

1207
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:28,210
Avenue Balcony?

1208
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:30,930
Avenue Balcony.

1209
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,430
Oh, here.

1210
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,360
I fought the giant tree?

1211
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,480
Where did I fight it?

1212
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,680
Oh, that guy.

1213
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,980
I was like, where did I fight a giant tree?

1214
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,120
I was like, where did I fight a giant tree?

1215
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,680
Okay.

1216
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,270
Okay, where do I walk though?

1217
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,090
I walk from here?

1218
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,090
Okay, left.

1219
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,270
Oh, shit.

1220
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:10,730
Okay.

1221
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:12,930
All right.

1222
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,550
Let's see if I can run past all of this guy again.

1223
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,170
Okay, he's right behind me, isn't he?

1224
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,610
Oh, I hear him.

1225
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,630
I absolutely hear him.

1226
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,330
It's okay.

1227
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,310
If I keep running, it's like he's never here.

1228
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,830
Go from here, or do I go straight?

1229
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,670
Oh, he's still following me.

1230
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,210
Oh, no.

1231
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,030
Oh, no.

1232
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,390
Oh, no.

1233
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:45,770
Out of my head?

1234
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,300
Don't worry.

1235
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,180
Oh, he's gone.

1236
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,600
No, he's just slowly heading over.

1237
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,540
Never mind.

1238
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,380
He is not gone.

1239
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,920
He's just very, very slowly coming.

1240
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,420
Oh, hey.

1241
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,120
Hello there.

1242
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:06,740
Okay.

1243
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,560
These guys are weak, so it's fine.

1244
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,430
Hey, guys.

1245
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,170
Get out of here.

1246
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,270
This is my dead body.

1247
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,130
That's fucking right.

1248
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:22,870
Leave!

1249
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,960
Okay, and then I'll go this way.

1250
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,460
Oh, they're praying to something up here.

1251
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,920
Oh, shit.

1252
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,240
I knew it.

1253
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,440
I was like, I should lock on to see if there's anything hiding.

1254
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,940
I knew it.

1255
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,120
I know my Elden Ring.

1256
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,700
I knew you were hiding.

1257
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,000
I see you.

1258
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,100
I see you.

1259
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,360
Oh, you were sleeping.

1260
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,320
He was like, he was like, what do you mean?

1261
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,680
I was just trying to sleep.

1262
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:00,960
Oh, my God.

1263
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,320
Okay.

1264
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,880
He's like, what do you mean you're sleeping?

1265
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,220
All right.

1266
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:11,640
Nice.

1267
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,100
Oh, my lantern.

1268
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,660
You're right.

1269
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,240
Now I see everything.

1270
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,380
Okay, there's people up here.

1271
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,060
Oh, wait.

1272
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,580
There's a lot of people up here.

1273
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,120
Wait, what the fuck?

1274
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,060
Okay, maybe I should summon something here.

1275
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,760
Yeah, this guy.

1276
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,920
Holy shit.

1277
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,040
Holy shit.

1278
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:42,540
Hey!

1279
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,100
Hey!

1280
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,500
Okay.

1281
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,980
Oh, my God.

1282
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,560
Okay, never mind.

1283
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:45,820
Oh, my.

1284
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,600
He beat up my child.

1285
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:48,620
I'm like, never mind, sir.

1286
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:48,980
Oh, I'm sorry!

1287
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,980
That's gonna be like, hey, stop beating up my child!

1288
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,180
I'm like, never mind, sir.

1289
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,100
Never mind.

1290
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,220
Go do your thing if you want to.

1291
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,280
Okay.

1292
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:11,690
Jesus!

1293
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:13,210
Holy shit!

1294
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,270
He does so much damage!

1295
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:16,910
Okay.

1296
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,170
There we go.

1297
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,850
All right, one down.

1298
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,050
Who are they praying to?

1299
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:29,110
All right.

1300
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,850
Who are they praying to?

1301
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,410
I should float heal just in case.

1302
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,110
All right.

1303
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,650
Oh my God, please, get down from here.

1304
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,490
All right, nice.

1305
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,890
Oh!

1306
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,630
Not nice!

1307
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:50,690
Not nice!

1308
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:51,430
Not nice!

1309
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,970
This is not a good thing to do.

1310
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,230
Guys, it's very mean.

1311
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,510
Very, very, very mean.

1312
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,050
Okay, nice.

1313
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,070
Let's get rid of magic man.

1314
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,590
Wait, he fucking healed?

1315
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:11,370
That's legal!

1316
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,670
You don't have the right tool!

1317
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:17,980
Okay.

1318
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,780
I'll break your fucking shield.

1319
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,080
I don't care.

1320
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,660
I don't care.

1321
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,140
Get out.

1322
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:36,890
Get out!

1323
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,030
That's right!

1324
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:42,530
No God can help you now!

1325
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:46,690
Oops.

1326
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,750
That's fucking right.

1327
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,350
Pray to no one!

1328
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,230
Okay, they're all dead.

1329
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:02,330
All right, nice.

1330
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,350
I got the butterfly.

1331
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:12,530
I got the powder.

1332
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,210
Got the old fang.

1333
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,610
Then I'll grab this.

1334
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:20,830
Nice.

1335
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,580
All right, I guess we go forward now?

1336
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:31,780
Yeah.

1337
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,020
We go forward.

1338
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,160
First off, Earth Tree.

1339
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,300
Is there anything here?

1340
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,740
Climb on the spot.

1341
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,300
All of them.

1342
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,240
We're jumping off.

1343
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,800
Bloody, thank you for the super chat.

1344
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,520
Thank you, thank you.

1345
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,720
You'll probably want 20 arcane eventually.

1346
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,720
You want to use one...

1347
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:52,880
Oh!

1348
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:53,780
Okay.

1349
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,940
All right, up we go.

1350
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,580
My wife told me to go up.

1351
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,520
And I listen.

1352
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,320
Because I'm a good husband.

1353
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,340
There should be a grace ahead soon.

1354
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:16,420
Oh my god.

1355
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:22,700
A video popped up in my feed of this guy doing a capitalism, um, elder ring run.

1356
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:26,460
Where every step you take, uh, requires, like, money.

1357
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,500
Like, every single move you do requires money.

1358
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,980
That shit was crazy.

1359
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,560
And then it scales, too.

1360
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,460
So, like, at first it was, like, one...

1361
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,600
It costs, like, one, uh, rune every time you walk.

1362
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:45,580
And then the more, the richer you get, the richer you get, the more money it costs.

1363
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,500
And then when you die...

1364
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,660
When you die, you lose, like, you lose all your money.

1365
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,140
So you're, like, stuck in place.

1366
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,320
And he made his character, Jeff Bezos.

1367
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,660
What a fuck shot?

1368
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,320
Oh my god.

1369
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,140
I did not realize you existed, sir.

1370
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:08,880
Don't worry.

1371
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,400
Now you're just like them.

1372
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,120
Dead.

1373
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:21,650
Why did it say left side or somebody?

1374
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,210
Like, who's on my left?

1375
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,110
Also, I'm a little worried that, um...

1376
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,430
I'm a little worried that there's no grace near me.

1377
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:34,450
I'm a little worried that there's no grace near me.

1378
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:43,810
Oh.

1379
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:45,570
Hey.

1380
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:48,290
Oh!

1381
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,330
Oh, shit!

1382
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,250
That's what he meant by be wary of left!

1383
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,650
That's what he...

1384
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,960
Why didn't I just walk over you?

1385
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,100
I didn't need to summon him!

1386
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,360
It's okay.

1387
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,840
It's okay.

1388
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,320
Surely, I'm faster than a horse.

1389
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,720
He's shy!

1390
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,280
It's okay.

1391
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,400
I can do the serpentine.

1392
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,060
Did he give up?

1393
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,120
Oh, he got tired.

1394
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,300
The horse got tired.

1395
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,520
Right.

1396
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,460
That's good of him.

1397
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,760
I don't like how there's a lot of bloodstains here.

1398
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,600
What's wrong with the horse?

1399
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:05,270
I just want to make sure there's nothing here.

1400
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,690
Why are there bloodstains all over this area?

1401
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,130
Cellar ahead.

1402
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,490
Praise the tarnish.

1403
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,050
Praise the high road.

1404
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,520
Stupid horse.

1405
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:30,780
Wow,

1406
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,700
this is very awfully dark.

1407
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,400
Is there Grace here?

1408
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,040
Guys?

1409
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,920
Guys, is there Grace here?

1410
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,500
I need to know before I go down here.

1411
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,600
Guys, it looks so safe.

1412
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,700
Grace, the thing is...

1413
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,700
I don't know why I don't, like, trust you.

1414
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,740
When you said that...

1415
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,060
For some reason, that did not...

1416
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,960
Sound accurate.

1417
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,320
Because it was scary and dark down there.

1418
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,380
What do you mean, why did I go back?

1419
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,620
Did you not see the same room as I did?

1420
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,380
Did this room not look scary and dark to you?

1421
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,570
Like, why did I go back?

1422
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:36,630
Oh, yeah.

1423
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:36,930
Oh, hey.

1424
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:37,550
Great citizen.

1425
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:38,970
Oh my god.

1426
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,410
You guys were telling the truth.

1427
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,270
For once.

1428
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,310
How did this guy die?

1429
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,580
Alright, what do I level up?

1430
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,680
Alright, I'm gonna use the bathroom and chat.

1431
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,640
You guys decide amongst yourselves.

1432
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,380
Uh, and nominate a spokesperson on what to upgrade next.

1433
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,040
I'll be right back.

1434
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:11,740
I need some bathroom.

1435
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,660
Alright, I'm back.

1436
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,000
Did you guys nominate your one?

1437
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,200
Your one?

1438
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,400
Your spokesperson?

1439
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,360
Faith or Riot?

1440
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,740
Alright.

1441
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,680
We unanimously decided on faith.

1442
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,420
I am the one.

1443
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,160
Okay, I'm reading through this.

1444
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,860
Who will?

1445
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,820
Who will speak for you guys?

1446
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:34,440
Who speaks for you guys, to be your spokesperson?

1447
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,300
Absolutely not faith.

1448
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,780
Oh, you're not unanimous, guys.

1449
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,820
Anything that's not faith.

1450
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,340
Wow, I can't believe it.

1451
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,520
You're not even a hive mind, guys.

1452
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,840
I speak for the drag group.

1453
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,060
We nominate that.

1454
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,940
Apparently, apparently.

1455
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,720
There's no unanimous decision in the end.

1456
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,300
So, the trial is now a mistrial.

1457
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,940
The trial shall now be extended.

1458
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,460
Alright.

1459
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,780
Okay, arcane, then.

1460
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,920
We'll do arcane.

1461
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,200
Alright.

1462
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,020
Let's see.

1463
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:29,860
Where am I?

1464
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,200
Where actually am I?

1465
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:32,220
Yeah.

1466
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,660
We already did my one boss, anyway.

1467
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,720
So, like, I can technically just end stream here.

1468
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,900
But we won't.

1469
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,240
We won't.

1470
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:39,840
We'll keep going.

1471
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,460
We'll keep going.

1472
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,860
I did, but... I'm just saying.

1473
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,520
We technically did do our one story boss.

1474
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,540
Alan is a false prophet.

1475
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,160
Do not listen to him.

1476
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,720
Where is the fucking map?

1477
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,830
Oh, my God.

1478
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:09,470
They're everywhere.

1479
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,570
Oh, my God.

1480
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,970
I'm so fucking lost.

1481
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:19,590
Oh, my God.

1482
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:20,930
I almost fucking rode off.

1483
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,270
I'm trying to figure out where to go.

1484
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,580
I got a butterfly.

1485
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,040
It's so disorienting.

1486
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,860
Try the high road?

1487
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:39,900
Wait.

1488
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,200
What's that over there?

1489
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,530
It's not the high road.

1490
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,700
Okay.

1491
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,040
No.

1492
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,080
Oh.

1493
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,160
Someone says high.

1494
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:55,860
It says high.

1495
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,300
Oh, my God.

1496
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,220
It's a troll, isn't it?

1497
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:00,960
I'm not.

1498
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:01,880
I'm not fighting that.

1499
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,780
This area is so fucking dangerous.

1500
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh, my God.

1501
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,700
There was poison.

1502
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,300
Ah!

1503
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,400
I don't know how...

1504
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:10,960
Okay.

1505
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:11,720
That works.

1506
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,260
I don't know how I live, but I live...

1507
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:22,940
Nice recovery.

1508
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,520
I don't know how I did it.

1509
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,760
Oh, my God.

1510
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,920
It's so dark.

1511
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:32,840
What can I say?

1512
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,760
I'm just a gamer.

1513
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:35,580
Hee-hee.

1514
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,000
Nice.

1515
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,300
We need that golden seed.

1516
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,580
I guess we just go up.

1517
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,200
Oh, now it's the high road.

1518
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:46,940
Okay.

1519
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,500
There's clearly, like, people on me because I can't do anything.

1520
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,340
What does it say?

1521
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:56,980
Friend ahead?

1522
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,980
First off, dashing through.

1523
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,260
Weak foe ahead.

1524
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,420
Okay, guys.

1525
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:03,980
Is it friend?

1526
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:04,700
Okay, guys.

1527
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,740
I don't think that was friend.

1528
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,760
Oh, yeah.

1529
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:07,860
That's...

1530
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:08,460
Hmm.

1531
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,360
Hmm.

1532
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:11,560
Okay.

1533
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,480
There must be a grace nearby, though.

1534
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:13,960
Whoa!

1535
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:14,880
Shh!

1536
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,100
I don't super hope.

1537
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:37,580
Oh, my God.

1538
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,120
Oh, my God.

1539
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh, thank God.

1540
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,520
The statue was next there.

1541
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,940
Oh, thank God.

1542
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,220
Thank you.

1543
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,500
I was like, maybe I can dash through him.

1544
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,900
There must be a grace ahead.

1545
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,460
Oh, there is a grace ahead.

1546
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:54,480
Wow.

1547
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,480
Wowee.

1548
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,060
Oh.

1549
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:58,680
Oh.

1550
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,580
Surely he'll disappear, right?

1551
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,140
Surely he doesn't...

1552
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:05,480
Oh.

1553
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,060
Oh, he'll get tired.

1554
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:07,880
Oh!

1555
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,060
He didn't get tired.

1556
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,560
He didn't get tired, guys!

1557
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,640
He's not tired!

1558
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,600
He's still coming at me!

1559
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,220
Guys, surely he'll get tired, right?

1560
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:26,900
Surely...

1561
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,520
Surely he'll decide...

1562
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,700
Surely he'll be done, right?

1563
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,260
Wait, where is he?

1564
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:35,940
Oh!

1565
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:36,980
He got tired!

1566
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,020
Oh, my God!

1567
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,200
He actually did get tired!

1568
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:40,680
Oh, my God!

1569
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,820
He's actually EP!

1570
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,640
Oh, he's EP!

1571
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,660
I didn't hear no bell!

1572
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,100
Oh, my God!

1573
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:53,760
He got EP!

1574
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,340
Thank God!

1575
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,080
Okay, now...

1576
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,640
Now I can fight you!

1577
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,300
All right.

1578
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:06,510
Okay, now...

1579
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:07,630
Now we can be friends.

1580
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,650
We can be friends now.

1581
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,690
Where is he?

1582
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,310
Oh!

1583
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,610
Oh, my God.

1584
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:20,950
Child.

1585
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,150
Okay.

1586
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,310
Okay, now...

1587
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:25,770
Now...

1588
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:26,270
Now...

1589
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,070
Now we can do the real fight.

1590
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,150
Oh, my God.

1591
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,170
Oh, my God.

1592
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,030
He does so much.

1593
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:33,970
Wow.

1594
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:35,830
Oh, my God!

1595
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:36,410
What the fuck?

1596
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,730
Oh, what the fuck did he do?

1597
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,350
What did he do to me?

1598
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,730
Holy shit!

1599
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,190
What the fuck was that?

1600
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,090
Oh, my God.

1601
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:53,710
Okay.

1602
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,590
Okay.

1603
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:56,390
All right.

1604
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:00,610
Oh, it was one attack.

1605
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:05,730
Okay.

1606
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:07,370
Okay.

1607
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,830
That...

1608
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,570
That was a little wild.

1609
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,070
That was...

1610
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:17,090
This wouldn't have happened if you had me.

1611
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:20,630
I just didn't believe hard enough, apparently, guys.

1612
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:23,610
If only I started believing.

1613
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,490
Where is my runes?

1614
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,290
Oh, there it is.

1615
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,450
We'll just head for it.

1616
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:33,050
That'll be fine.

1617
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,210
It'll be fine, right?

1618
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:37,910
Oh.

1619
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,830
Don't worry, my little...

1620
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,350
Ay, ay, ay.

1621
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,430
My little jellyfish.

1622
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:45,330
She'll be so healthy.

1623
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:47,070
I really, really believe.

1624
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:48,470
All right.

1625
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:52,700
Okay.

1626
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,100
Clearly, I don't know.

1627
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,840
Oh, my God.

1628
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,070
I...

1629
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,130
Guys, I don't know if I want to fight him anymore.

1630
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,350
I figure it's always good investment.

1631
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,990
Corby, thank you for the super chat.

1632
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,450
Thank you.

1633
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,170
Thank you.

1634
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,170
Thank you.

1635
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,150
I'm starting to believe less and less.

1636
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:24,710
I...

1637
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:26,390
I...

1638
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,250
I...

1639
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:27,690
I...

1640
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,830
I'm starting to not believe anymore.

1641
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:35,030
It's getting a little harder to believe.

1642
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,260
I don't know why.

1643
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:51,900
Like...

1644
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:52,560
I don't know.

1645
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,620
He seems a little bullshit.

1646
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,280
Just a little bit.

1647
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,500
Oh, my God.

1648
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,860
Oh, my God.

1649
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,320
Okay.

1650
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,960
Yeah, this...

1651
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,140
Oh, my jellyfish!

1652
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:11,640
Holy shit!

1653
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,680
Bro!

1654
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:13,840
Oh, my God!

1655
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,640
He wasn't even allowed to live!

1656
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:27,420
Okay.

1657
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,820
You know, like...

1658
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,560
I would have been fine if, like...

1659
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:31,980
I...

1660
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:32,920
If, like...

1661
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,800
I'm allowed to have, like, a little...

1662
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,360
If my jellyfish was able to live, like, one second, at least.

1663
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,460
But I don't even think, like...

1664
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,620
Oh, my God!

1665
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,360
Guys, I think we'll come back another time.

1666
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:56,860
Don't worry.

1667
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:57,720
Don't worry.

1668
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:58,980
We'll come back.

1669
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,620
I swear to God, guys.

1670
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,820
We'll come back another time.

1671
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:06,200
And then she never came back.

1672
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:13,590
Don't worry.

1673
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:14,430
Don't worry, guys.

1674
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:15,330
We'll come back.

1675
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:15,890
I swear.

1676
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:19,930
We'll come back and say hello to them in another time.

1677
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,090
Don't worry, guys.

1678
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:29,790
Hello.

1679
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:33,290
You want to touch my hand?

1680
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:37,770
Yeah?

1681
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,630
You like my fingers?

1682
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,200
My dad said the same thing.

1683
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,100
The first sin?

1684
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,800
What's the second or third?

1685
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:12,200
Doing so will unbind destiny's death and slay the world itself.

1686
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,660
What's around that?

1687
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,800
Who would dare put you up to such a task?

1688
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,300
My beautiful wife.

1689
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,320
Most certainly not the fingers.

1690
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,960
My wife's...

1691
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,620
Am I Shrek?

1692
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,340
What am I...

1693
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,640
Oh no, it was Shrek.

1694
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,500
I can't...

1695
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:34,500
I'm like...

1696
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,520
Am I supposed to be Shrek right now?

1697
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:38,640
Okay.

1698
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,160
Let's go just burn the tree for my wife.

1699
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,600
Alright.

1700
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,320
The grand lift of Rod.

1701
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,580
Oh, it's a medallion.

1702
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,920
Look at my beautiful medallion that my wife gave me.

1703
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,860
It's all over.

1704
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:13,600
Oh?

1705
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,540
What's going on?

1706
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:23,830
Oh!

1707
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:25,910
Puppies!

1708
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:30,110
Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

1709
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:30,450
Thank you.

1710
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,010
Thank you.

1711
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:33,090
Second sin is Pokemon card style.

1712
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,190
There it is.

1713
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,890
Adultery.

1714
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,070
I'm just scanning my...

1715
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,090
My...

1716
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:42,070
Uh...

1717
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,170
My little badge here.

1718
01:24:43,790 --> 01:24:44,790
My fob.

1719
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:48,170
Yay!

1720
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:49,670
I've got my uppies!

1721
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,840
Oh!

1722
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,620
There's the tree!

1723
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,440
I'm gonna burn that tree down and then my wife will marry me.

1724
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,240
I got what's down here.

1725
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,680
Okay.

1726
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,240
Oh, hey.

1727
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:14,660
An item.

1728
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,080
Skellum, thank you for the super chat.

1729
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:20,420
Thank you.

1730
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,140
Thank you.

1731
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,640
Hi, Doki.

1732
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:28,500
The upcoming NPC is 100% telling the truth and more trustworthy than dad.

1733
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:28,920
Oh.

1734
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,040
Upcoming NPC.

1735
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,140
Who it's gonna be.

1736
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,160
How do I get back up?

1737
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:39,950
Okay.

1738
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:40,850
Oh, it's from here.

1739
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:41,170
Okay.

1740
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:44,590
Yeah.

1741
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:44,930
Yeah.

1742
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,830
Call her wife now.

1743
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:47,090
Cause it's our little fun nickname.

1744
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:48,110
She tells me to stop.

1745
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,430
But then I know she's just kidding.

1746
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:51,870
Tells me.

1747
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:52,570
She's like, stop.

1748
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:53,510
We're friends.

1749
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,970
And then that's her cute nickname for me, guys.

1750
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,450
She calls me friend and I call her wife.

1751
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,240
Oh, I was gonna say, can I kill it?

1752
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,200
Oh, is that the map?

1753
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:15,400
Oh, yeah.

1754
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,100
I got the map.

1755
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:17,740
Nice.

1756
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,140
Okay, so I have to go here next.

1757
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,660
Look, we held hands.

1758
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,000
We're like, literally married.

1759
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,260
We just don't have the papers yet.

1760
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,540
Because, like, that's just a formal thing.

1761
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,200
But informally, we held hands.

1762
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,100
And that means marriage.

1763
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,270
Alright.

1764
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:46,130
Is it him?

1765
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,170
Is that the friend?

1766
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:50,570
Are you ready?

1767
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:52,450
Enemy?

1768
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:53,610
Or friend?

1769
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,140
He's covering his face.

1770
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,080
I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel.

1771
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:13,940
Well.

1772
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,040
That is most unfortunate.

1773
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,920
For he is dead.

1774
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:20,440
Oh.

1775
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,660
As for his flesh.

1776
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,280
He gave it to me.

1777
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,560
Shabriri.

1778
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,980
I hope you can make your peace with that.

1779
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,840
You were about to sacrifice something precious.

1780
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,980
The life of a fair maiden.

1781
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,300
That you would toss into the fiery forge.

1782
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:42,740
No.

1783
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,120
He's my wife.

1784
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,780
What a horrible thing to ponder.

1785
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:51,380
Your ascendancy requires her sacrifice.

1786
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,720
Whether she wishes at all.

1787
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,780
I will never.

1788
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,360
I will never throw her into the fiery pits.

1789
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,240
I will never throw her into the fiery pits.

1790
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:04,140
Lies!

1791
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,960
Chosen, tarnished.

1792
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:06,980
And would be.

1793
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,340
Dare to tread the path of true rigor.

1794
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:12,740
Spare.

1795
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,120
The poor girl.

1796
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,500
Heaven, thank you for the super chat.

1797
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:15,880
Thank you.

1798
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,620
Thank you.

1799
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:17,300
Thank you.

1800
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,620
Thank you.

1801
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,680
If you are prepared to show resolve.

1802
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,540
And attain lordship through righteous hardship.

1803
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:27,320
Then heed the words of I.

1804
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:30,100
Shabriri.

1805
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,280
Shabriri.

1806
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,460
What is it?

1807
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:33,840
Chosen, tarnished.

1808
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,020
And would be lord.

1809
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,240
Descend into the depths far below the eardtree capital.

1810
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,240
Seek audience with the three fingers.

1811
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,420
And the flame of frenzy.

1812
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:47,920
If you inherit the flame of frenzy.

1813
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,600
Your flesh will serve as kindling.

1814
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,160
And the girl.

1815
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:55,980
Can be spared.

1816
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,540
Setting you on the righteous path of lordship.

1817
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,180
The path of the lord of chaos.

1818
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,560
Burn the eardtree to the ground.

1819
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,640
That's what I'm gonna do.

1820
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:15,180
And incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.

1821
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:19,980
Ah, may chaos take the world.

1822
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,200
Oh my god.

1823
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:22,780
Oh my god.

1824
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,280
Take the world.

1825
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,880
Chosen, tarnished.

1826
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,000
And would be lord.

1827
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,160
Descend into the depths.

1828
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:32,880
Okay, so.

1829
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,460
He wants me to do that.

1830
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:37,560
And then my beautiful wife will live.

1831
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,020
Sage and thank you for the magenta super.

1832
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:41,720
Thank you.

1833
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,320
Thank you.

1834
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,980
Ah, may chaos take the world.

1835
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,480
Yeah, he's just been really liking the chaos shit.

1836
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,660
Okay, so.

1837
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,420
He said the thing.

1838
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:55,840
He said the thing.

1839
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,320
My wife has something to tell me.

1840
01:29:58,720 --> 01:29:59,280
Oh, wife.

1841
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,280
Oh, wife.

1842
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,560
Oh.

1843
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,060
Okay.

1844
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,280
I go talk to my wife now.

1845
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,960
Wife time, wife time.

1846
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,060
Yay.

1847
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,680
Wife time, wife time.

1848
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:19,620
Wait, where's my...

1849
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,800
Wait, where's the grace for this?

1850
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:22,320
I don't...

1851
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,520
Oh, I skipped the grace.

1852
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,980
My grace was all the way back there.

1853
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,280
Wife time, wife time.

1854
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,600
Hello, wife.

1855
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,240
Oh, make sure you don't burn.

1856
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:37,720
Oh, my God.

1857
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,480
I forgot he's, like, right next to the grace.

1858
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:50,190
There is something I'd like to say.

1859
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:51,350
Yeah?

1860
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:53,710
My purpose was given to me by my mother.

1861
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,090
But now...

1862
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,290
I act of my own volition.

1863
01:30:58,670 --> 01:31:02,850
I have set my heart upon the world that I would have.

1864
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:06,450
Regardless of my mother's designs.

1865
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:10,770
I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.

1866
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:12,350
Not even you.

1867
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:14,090
Oh?

1868
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,970
Don't worry, wife.

1869
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:19,410
I'll make sure nothing bad happens to you.

1870
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:21,350
Because I love you.

1871
01:31:21,490 --> 01:31:22,450
And we're in love.

1872
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:26,070
And we're gonna live happily ever after.

1873
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:26,990
My wife.

1874
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,310
Wait, so do I kill him?

1875
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:41,290
I want to actually kill him for, like, his armor.

1876
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:44,930
Yes.

1877
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,640
Oh, I get a new katana?

1878
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,880
But is it, like, a good katana?

1879
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,520
Is it a better katana?

1880
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:16,530
Oh, I get...

1881
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:17,790
It doesn't affect the story?

1882
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,460
I swear to God.

1883
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,140
Because I will do it.

1884
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,460
I don't get the katana here?

1885
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,140
Oh, okay.

1886
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,560
I guess I don't do it.

1887
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,240
You guys just don't want me to kill people.

1888
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:41,980
That's fucked up.

1889
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,040
I just want me to kill people for the sake.

1890
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,480
Look, look.

1891
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,460
I kill people, but, like...

1892
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:52,840
I do it because I want something in return.

1893
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,840
I don't do it just...

1894
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,600
Oh, shit!

1895
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,960
I don't do it just for fun.

1896
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,420
I also do it for, like, their items.

1897
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:03,780
That's different.

1898
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:04,780
Oh, my God.

1899
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,240
Oh, my God.

1900
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,740
Why is she so strong?

1901
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,680
She is so strong!

1902
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,600
Yeah, I don't kill for free, guys.

1903
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,640
I need to get something in return.

1904
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:18,580
Okay, I need to summon jellyfish here.

1905
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:20,820
She is actually really strong.

1906
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,140
Yeah, I...

1907
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:27,040
If I'm gonna commit murder, I might as well commit theft as well.

1908
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:28,800
Like, you know?

1909
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,340
Because it's like...

1910
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,280
Because, like, if I'm gonna commit all the crime...

1911
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,960
I might as well commit all the other...

1912
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:36,580
Rest of the crime.

1913
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,380
Too.

1914
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,940
Because I already...

1915
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:39,920
I already went that far.

1916
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,580
So it only makes sense.

1917
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,580
Okay, I definitely need to upgrade that...

1918
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,400
Uh...

1919
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,160
Oh, my God.

1920
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,200
I need to find churches.

1921
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,260
I need to get a church.

1922
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,060
I...

1923
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,480
Okay, there we go.

1924
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,840
Oh, there's a...

1925
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:07,740
Belly right here.

1926
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,120
Right?

1927
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:11,800
It's not a church?

1928
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,200
No.

1929
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:12,620
Fuck!

1930
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:13,600
I thought that was a church.

1931
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,840
Or it's a church up here.

1932
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,360
Hello?

1933
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,280
Hello?

1934
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, God.

1935
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:36,580
Oh, God.

1936
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:37,640
There's so many of them.

1937
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:38,680
They're so strong.

1938
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,740
There's way too many of them.

1939
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:49,890
Wait.

1940
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:50,690
Right here?

1941
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:51,410
Right where?

1942
01:34:57,490 --> 01:34:59,030
Which one is the church?

1943
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,850
I mean, that's the...

1944
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,850
Wait.

1945
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:05,550
Where am I?

1946
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,150
Go underground?

1947
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,620
Yeah?

1948
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,660
No.

1949
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:21,660
Wait.

1950
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:22,220
Wait.

1951
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:32,130
Yeah?

1952
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:38,570
Where the hole...

1953
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:40,690
Where there's a hole, there's a goal.

1954
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:43,610
There's no holes.

1955
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,140
There's no holes.

1956
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,640
I'm looking for all the holes.

1957
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,700
Where are my holes?

1958
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:04,780
Where am I going?

1959
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:12,170
Oh, through the ruins?

1960
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:16,470
Oh, so I just keep going from here.

1961
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:22,110
But I gotta avoid the maidens, because the maidens are scary.

1962
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:26,650
My body is only for my wife.

1963
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:29,190
Be gone!

1964
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:32,170
Be gone, wretched whores!

1965
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:36,650
This body is only for my wife!

1966
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:41,830
My beautiful wife that held my hand!

1967
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,980
That's right!

1968
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,310
Whoa!

1969
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,710
Oh, that's...

1970
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,120
That's a hole.

1971
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,660
No enemy ahead?

1972
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:07,540
Something ahead?

1973
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,540
Okay, guys.

1974
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,780
You can't be like, no enemy ahead, and then something ahead.

1975
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:15,620
Oh, nice.

1976
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:18,020
Whoa!

1977
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,830
Whoa?

1978
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:26,650
Oh, no.

1979
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:27,250
Oh, no.

1980
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:28,410
He triggered...

1981
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:29,450
Oh, no!

1982
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:30,610
I can't get out!

1983
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:31,630
Oh, I can't.

1984
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:38,940
What's this?

1985
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:41,840
Oh.

1986
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,380
Then my jellyfish fell.

1987
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,660
I think my jellyfish fell down.

1988
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:57,050
Okay, so we have the stones now.

1989
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,570
It's okay, I can...

1990
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:00,690
Oh!

1991
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:03,010
I can go this way.

1992
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:07,700
Alright.

1993
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,900
Leave now.

1994
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,120
Oh!

1995
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,260
Hmm...

1996
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,160
Maybe I should just...

1997
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,000
You know, I'm just gonna...

1998
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,080
I'm gonna go back to the grace first, actually.

1999
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,900
I'm just gonna go to the table.

2000
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:28,900
Real quick.

2001
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:33,090
Look at that.

2002
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:34,430
I saved my stuff from...

2003
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:35,010
Or my wife.

2004
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,770
I'll give the bell to the...

2005
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,710
To the ladies.

2006
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:46,550
There you go.

2007
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,610
Yay!

2008
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:51,270
I'll upgrade my sword, too.

2009
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:57,900
Uh...

2010
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:58,800
Oh my god!

2011
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,160
She can upgrade my jellyfish!

2012
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:02,800
Nah?

2013
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,340
Oh, I can't.

2014
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:04,740
Fuck!

2015
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,580
I don't have the grave gloves.

2016
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:07,000
Whatever.

2017
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:14,340
Okay.

2018
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,680
I just need smithing stone 5.

2019
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:19,040
Okay, I can afford that.

2020
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,160
Should be able to afford that.

2021
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,720
I just bought the stone.

2022
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:30,940
Yeah, but I don't need Margaret's sword.

2023
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,180
I have katanas.

2024
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:38,950
There you go.

2025
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:39,690
This is what we needed.

2026
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:42,750
Yeah, buy five...

2027
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,450
I have katanas.

2028
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,580
Would Margaret have katanas?

2029
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,780
Well, he doesn't.

2030
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:55,860
So, um...

2031
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:56,600
Checkmate.

2032
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:00,480
I forgot I need runes to do this.

2033
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,260
I am...

2034
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,520
Okay, wait.

2035
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:07,670
I have one more...

2036
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,720
Yeah, I had this.

2037
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:10,420
Three thousand.

2038
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:13,760
There you go.

2039
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,670
Yeah, which one's...

2040
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,740
No, this is my OG sword.

2041
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,320
Okay, nice.

2042
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,560
Alright, I'll talk to the boss.

2043
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:31,600
So...

2044
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,000
I'll talk to...

2045
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,780
Three toes.

2046
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,620
You managed to return.

2047
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,200
You know what this means.

2048
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,980
The earth tree has burned you.

2049
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,700
The fingers...

2050
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,240
Remain still...

2051
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:54,340
Shaken...

2052
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,380
By this turn of events.

2053
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,520
They are busy...

2054
01:40:58,340 --> 01:40:59,860
Consulting the Kratos will.

2055
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,360
When they are finished...

2056
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,620
The fingers will again...

2057
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:05,820
Offer their guidance.

2058
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,240
But thousands...

2059
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,260
If not tens of thousands...

2060
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,280
Of moons must first pass.

2061
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,800
No matter for me.

2062
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,800
But you...

2063
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,100
How will you...

2064
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,480
Ever manage to wait?

2065
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:23,860
My...

2066
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,160
Oh...

2067
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:25,800
My...

2068
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:30,470
Uh...

2069
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,780
What's this?

2070
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:38,940
Yeah, see?

2071
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,540
Those aren't katanas!

2072
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,520
I know a katana when I see one.

2073
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,520
Or this non-katana.

2074
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,720
Holy shit, wait.

2075
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,840
Their armor is pretty...

2076
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:54,340
Wait, do I...

2077
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:55,320
Take their armor though?

2078
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,920
Wait, their armor is pretty...

2079
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,520
Is their armor better than what I have?

2080
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:16,210
That is generally good, but it's heavy?

2081
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:16,730
Oh!

2082
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:18,150
Oh, okay.

2083
01:42:18,410 --> 01:42:19,470
I'll grab his armor then.

2084
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:20,650
But I didn't have money though.

2085
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:21,570
I don't have money.

2086
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:23,410
No money.

2087
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,350
Heavens forbid.

2088
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:30,730
That is not the domain of mere men.

2089
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:36,230
The burning of the earth tree is the first cardinal sin.

2090
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:37,850
And you...

2091
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,670
Why is it the first?

2092
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:40,570
There's so many worse things I could do.

2093
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:41,310
The rune of death, too.

2094
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:44,610
The rune of death goes...

2095
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,570
The other...

2096
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,330
Is destined death.

2097
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:54,850
The forbidden shadow plucked from the golden order upon its creation.

2098
01:42:55,890 --> 01:43:00,570
Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable.

2099
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:06,070
The fingers would never permit it.

2100
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:09,030
Nor would the greater will.

2101
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,240
Why not?

2102
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:17,660
But here we are.

2103
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:21,500
So then I can be your guide if I kill that guy.

2104
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,700
...seving our link to the greater will.

2105
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:27,380
In ruins...

2106
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:34,360
Impossible events transpire beyond the ken of the fingers.

2107
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:40,760
Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?

2108
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,480
Go on.

2109
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,480
Finish the job.

2110
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:44,680
See?

2111
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:45,980
She wants me to do it.

2112
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,660
Take the course you deem most worthy.

2113
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:50,700
That's right.

2114
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,340
I'm gonna do it.

2115
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,900
How do I burn the thorns?

2116
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,880
You must find kindling.

2117
01:43:55,180 --> 01:44:04,020
Only the smoldering flame in the great forge of the giants on the highest peak in the lands between can burn the earth tree.

2118
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,100
She's like, you can't do it.

2119
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:05,600
It's a sin.

2120
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,940
Anyway, it would be pretty cool.

2121
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:10,800
But special kindling is required to reignite the flame.

2122
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,920
She believes in me.

2123
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:15,700
For the flame to burn the earth tree.

2124
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:18,800
A sacrifice is needed.

2125
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:23,160
Of one who envisions the flame.

2126
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:27,140
And can lead you to the ruin of death.

2127
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,480
Okay, so...

2128
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,600
That's how you burn the thorns.

2129
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:35,480
Alright.

2130
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:38,300
We can head over...

2131
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,640
Back here now.

2132
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:41,980
Now we can keep going.

2133
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:49,580
Alright.

2134
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,380
Don't worry.

2135
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,700
I'm gonna do it for my wife.

2136
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:54,720
A beautiful wife.

2137
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,220
Who also loves me very, very much, guys.

2138
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,220
She said if I do all of this...

2139
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:04,980
She imp...

2140
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,120
Okay, she didn't say it.

2141
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,660
But she implied...

2142
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:11,700
That if I do all of that, then we can officially get married.

2143
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:13,620
I...

2144
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:14,860
I read all...

2145
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,540
I read it from her body language.

2146
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:19,940
Oh, she knows.

2147
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:20,540
She knows.

2148
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,960
She implied that she knew.

2149
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:26,860
What?

2150
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:27,960
Oh, I heard something.

2151
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:32,820
Alright.

2152
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:33,500
Oh, hey.

2153
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,360
Is there like a...

2154
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,480
Dungeon nearby?

2155
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,000
Oh, hello.

2156
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:38,760
Oh, my God!

2157
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,780
I was like, hello, birdies.

2158
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:42,560
Oh!

2159
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:48,710
Oh, my God.

2160
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:49,170
That's it.

2161
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:50,070
You're gonna be endangered.

2162
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:50,790
I don't care.

2163
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:52,270
I don't care if you're on the list.

2164
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:57,350
Oh, my God.

2165
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:00,790
Fucking...

2166
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,190
Oh, my God.

2167
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:01,890
You stupid bird.

2168
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:03,090
You're actually such a stupid bird.

2169
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:04,670
You're such a stupid bird!

2170
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:08,970
Holy...

2171
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:11,830
Why is this bird so fucking tanky?

2172
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:20,730
I don't care if these birds are on the list.

2173
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:24,270
Huh?

2174
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,190
Oh, there's a...

2175
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:31,090
There should be a dungeon nearby.

2176
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,260
Where did it point to?

2177
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:39,000
Like this way?

2178
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,260
Oh, my God.

2179
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:43,200
There's so many of them.

2180
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:49,650
It's like the bald eagles.

2181
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:51,490
Where you're not supposed to disturb their habitat.

2182
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:52,610
Because they're...

2183
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:53,030
Um...

2184
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:53,670
Endangered.

2185
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:56,350
I'm gonna finish the job.

2186
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:57,490
I...

2187
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:03,570
I will finish the job.

2188
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:05,510
Oh, my God.

2189
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:06,450
Oh, my God.

2190
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:09,070
Oh, my God.

2191
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:11,050
Oh, my...

2192
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:11,430
What?

2193
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:13,230
Toki, is this finishing the job?

2194
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:14,030
I will.

2195
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:14,730
I...

2196
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:15,850
Guys, give me a sec.

2197
01:47:21,670 --> 01:47:23,390
Oh, my God.

2198
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:25,290
Oh, my God.

2199
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:25,450
Oh, my God.

2200
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:26,670
Where the fuck is the wife?

2201
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:27,770
It's the husband.

2202
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:33,110
Oh, my God.

2203
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:35,010
He's gonna finish the job.

2204
01:47:35,570 --> 01:47:36,730
Oh, my God.

2205
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:37,610
Oh, my God.

2206
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:37,610
Oh,

2207
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:41,030
my God.

2208
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:42,230
I

2209
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,520
do not know where the fuck that bird came from.

2210
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:04,880
Oh, my God.

2211
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:05,420
That...

2212
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:06,980
Did anyone get his license plate?

2213
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:10,300
That bird came out of fucking nowhere.

2214
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,320
I swear to God.

2215
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:17,930
Okay.

2216
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:20,050
I'm not finishing anything, clearly.

2217
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:24,570
Wanna know what...

2218
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:25,690
If there's anything here.

2219
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:27,490
But there's nothing here.

2220
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:28,890
What the fuck?

2221
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:30,610
Why was there, like, an indent here?

2222
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,570
That's so weird.

2223
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:38,230
There was, like, an indent here.

2224
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:45,450
I swear to God, it...

2225
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:46,270
Oh, my God.

2226
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:46,790
That...

2227
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:47,930
That was the wrong move.

2228
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:49,230
I was trying to get off this horse.

2229
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,320
Are you serious?

2230
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,240
He was one HP.

2231
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,540
Oh, my God.

2232
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,220
Get out of here.

2233
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:02,600
That really is...

2234
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:03,360
No, it's not.

2235
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:03,920
I knew it.

2236
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,260
Fucking knew that was not a secret path.

2237
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,180
Wait, what?

2238
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,960
That's 2,000.

2239
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,500
Oh, my God.

2240
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:18,700
2,000 people?

2241
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:21,620
Are you serious?

2242
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,640
I can't believe it.

2243
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,100
It has 2,000 votes.

2244
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,200
And I'm continuing the cycle.

2245
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:29,360
I'm...

2246
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,640
I'm gonna continue the cycle.

2247
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:36,820
It has 2,001 votes now.

2248
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,660
Just one burn.

2249
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,780
Goddamn, fuck you.

2250
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:53,460
Wait, what's over here?

2251
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:56,020
Wait, what?

2252
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:57,980
What path is this?

2253
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:01,480
Am I supposed to go this pathway?

2254
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:03,360
Wait.

2255
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:05,300
Is it this way, or...

2256
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,480
This is another path.

2257
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,560
There's another path, like...

2258
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:11,940
Here.

2259
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:17,250
Oh, that's for the dungeon?

2260
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:18,570
Okay.

2261
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:23,050
What... Where does this go?

2262
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:24,770
Is this...

2263
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:26,010
Story or dungeon?

2264
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:28,030
Oh, that's the main path.

2265
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,410
Oh.

2266
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:31,970
Okay.

2267
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,770
So, what about this path over here?

2268
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:38,620
Wait.

2269
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,620
Oh, no.

2270
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,640
That is the main path.

2271
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:41,980
Sorry.

2272
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:42,540
I got...

2273
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:43,500
There's no other path.

2274
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:43,960
I'm sorry.

2275
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:44,740
I'm going...

2276
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:45,300
Crazy.

2277
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,660
There's no other...

2278
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,460
There's no other path.

2279
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,260
That was the main path.

2280
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:57,380
That was the same path, guys.

2281
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:02,080
Oh, shit.

2282
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:02,300
Oh, shit.

2283
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:03,140
That's a lot of people.

2284
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:06,380
Oh, no.

2285
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:07,060
I got two in my head.

2286
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:07,500
Oh, here?

2287
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,420
Oh, hey.

2288
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,480
Oh, there's a dungeon.

2289
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,480
Found the dungeon.

2290
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:21,620
Found the dungeon.

2291
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:26,100
How did he die?

2292
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,220
Oh.

2293
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:31,260
Oh.

2294
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:32,680
Oh.

2295
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,280
That's how.

2296
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:41,300
Wait.

2297
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:42,120
What do you mean oh, no?

2298
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:43,240
Oh, wait.

2299
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:47,240
This is a dungeon full of suffering?

2300
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:47,800
Wait.

2301
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:48,260
No.

2302
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:53,740
Oh, no, no, no.

2303
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,600
Oh!

2304
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,000
No.

2305
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,380
No.

2306
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:14,160
No.

2307
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:14,180
No!

2308
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:15,360
No!

2309
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:17,640
Yes.

2310
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:29,120
Okay.

2311
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,660
Come on, get over here.

2312
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:33,880
Are you serious?

2313
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,440
It goes through your fucking friend?

2314
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:39,560
Okay.

2315
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:46,310
Oh my god.

2316
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:47,050
Catch us.

2317
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:48,550
Fucker.

2318
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:55,030
Okay, there's the be wary part.

2319
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:56,710
Okay.

2320
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:57,830
Level seven.

2321
01:52:58,030 --> 01:52:58,430
Oh my gosh.

2322
01:52:58,530 --> 01:52:59,830
I skipped level six somewhere.

2323
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:11,480
It's really his buddy has to be somewhere.

2324
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:12,040
I knew it.

2325
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:12,580
I knew it.

2326
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:14,980
I knew his buddy would be here somewhere.

2327
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:18,800
Man, I see you.

2328
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:20,620
I see you.

2329
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:23,820
What?

2330
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,460
What the fuck was that range?

2331
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:31,050
Okay.

2332
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:37,610
Alright, let's grab this guy out.

2333
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:43,960
Just to be safe.

2334
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,900
I know there was no message there, but just to be safe.

2335
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:51,740
How did you die?

2336
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:57,060
How did you die?

2337
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:58,700
That's good to know.

2338
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,740
Wait, what the fuck?

2339
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:01,620
How did he die?

2340
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:13,950
Oh shit, I forgot to grab that plant.

2341
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,600
Okay, he did it.

2342
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:22,180
Oh my god, this is a deep asshole.

2343
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,200
Yeah, no wonder she fucking died.

2344
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:27,980
Try it down.

2345
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:29,420
What?

2346
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,340
Try underground?

2347
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:36,340
First off, so to speak require- Oh.

2348
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:48,910
Okay, fucking liars.

2349
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:51,340
What the fuck do you- Oh!

2350
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:57,120
Oh!

2351
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:01,340
What the fuck am I supposed to get down from there?

2352
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,380
Okay, we'll go to the secret passage.

2353
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,000
Alright.

2354
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:21,260
Oh my god, this is a deep asshole too.

2355
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,700
Okay, there's no more messages here.

2356
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:31,180
So I assume that this is the right place.

2357
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:40,620
Why is there so many dead- Oh my god.

2358
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,600
What the fuck is that?

2359
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:47,740
What the fuck is that?

2360
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,760
Trap required a head?

2361
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,060
There's a trap?

2362
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:57,000
Guys, I don't think that's friendly.

2363
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:58,140
Oh!

2364
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,920
What?

2365
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,580
Oh my god!

2366
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:07,730
What do you mean?

2367
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:24,430
I think it's just really, really friendly.

2368
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,580
Okay, what the fuck does it- I did it!

2369
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:34,660
What the fuck?

2370
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:37,960
Oh, this is what he means.

2371
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:40,000
Oh my god.

2372
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,800
I think he's stuck.

2373
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,330
Wait, I think he's stuck.

2374
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:00,570
I...

2375
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,030
I'm so sad.

2376
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:05,290
I'm so sad.

2377
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:08,810
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2378
01:57:09,230 --> 01:57:11,150
Why is it all traps?

2379
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:15,150
Oh my god, of course.

2380
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:17,110
Oh my god.

2381
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:18,410
Because of course they are.

2382
01:57:18,910 --> 01:57:21,230
Oh, of course they're there.

2383
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:26,940
Okay, we'll just wait.

2384
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:40,840
Okay, let's get these guys out of here first.

2385
01:57:51,670 --> 01:57:52,170
Okay.

2386
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:55,710
Where the fuck do I?

2387
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:00,110
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2388
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:03,190
Attacking.

2389
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:06,670
Range battle ahead.

2390
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:15,250
Run, run, run.

2391
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:27,270
Peekaboo!

2392
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,780
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2393
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:42,720
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2394
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,060
Do you think he knows?

2395
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:01,840
No, I already got it.

2396
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:03,040
How do I...

2397
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,600
What the fuck do I do?

2398
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:10,020
Okay.

2399
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:31,160
Maybe he'll go through the trap.

2400
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,620
Maybe he'll touch the trap.

2401
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,060
Maybe he'll touch it.

2402
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:37,200
Oh my god.

2403
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:37,760
No.

2404
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:38,540
No, no, no.

2405
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:38,940
Come back.

2406
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:39,680
Come back.

2407
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:40,580
Come back.

2408
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:43,260
Oh please, come back.

2409
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:48,780
Okay.

2410
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,360
Just keep blowing on him.

2411
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,260
Just keep blowing.

2412
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,060
Just keep blowing.

2413
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:11,560
Just keep blowing.

2414
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,420
Oh my god, it's frozen.

2415
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:16,240
Oh my god, no!

2416
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:17,760
I fucking fucked it up again!

2417
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:19,500
Come back up!

2418
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:27,960
Just keep blowing.

2419
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:29,580
Just keep blowing.

2420
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,480
Stay frosty.

2421
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,600
Oh my god.

2422
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:54,030
Jesus Christ.

2423
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:57,210
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2424
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:05,590
Please just die!

2425
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:07,010
Please!

2426
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,410
Just die!

2427
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:13,970
Oh my god, he's what?

2428
02:01:19,990 --> 02:01:21,250
Oh my god.

2429
02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:21,610
Oh my god.

2430
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:23,790
3,000, that's all I get.

2431
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:26,090
I just get 3,000.

2432
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:33,140
Oh my god, that's actually all I get.

2433
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,360
That's it.

2434
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,300
That's all I get?

2435
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,280
I just...

2436
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:40,840
Okay.

2437
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,320
Alright.

2438
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,140
Alright, that's cool.

2439
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:50,700
That's cool.

2440
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:53,880
Alright.

2441
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,940
Oh my god, how did he get there?

2442
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,160
How the fuck did he get back there?

2443
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,500
Maybe it'll touch him.

2444
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:03,800
Oh nice, it did.

2445
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,840
Oh nice, he doesn't know.

2446
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,820
We'll just slowly kill him.

2447
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:08,280
That's fine.

2448
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,060
Oh my god, I almost walked into that.

2449
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:13,380
Not even a lousy shirt.

2450
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:15,880
I can wait.

2451
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:19,480
I can't... I can wait.

2452
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,740
I'm patient.

2453
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:25,640
We'll just wait.

2454
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:26,580
We'll wait here.

2455
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:32,680
Oh you're fine.

2456
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,240
Oh you're fine.

2457
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:44,480
Nice, thank you for the super chat.

2458
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:45,680
Thank you, thank you.

2459
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:47,300
Come on.

2460
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:48,820
That's just two more hits.

2461
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:53,060
The hardest battle of my life.

2462
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:03,260
Oh my god, what a fight.

2463
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:08,240
Truly was the fight of our generation.

2464
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:09,840
Right there.

2465
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,120
The 1v1.

2466
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:13,780
Of a lifetime.

2467
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,580
It's over here.

2468
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,100
In this.

2469
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:24,040
Wow, Doki.

2470
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:25,440
What a gamer.

2471
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,620
Truly the gamer of our generation.

2472
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,860
Right here.

2473
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:35,600
Okay.

2474
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,040
Was that really it?

2475
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:38,720
That's everything down here?

2476
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:42,100
I guess I should go back and grab some more meds.

2477
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,040
Yeah, I was gonna sit.

2478
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:46,580
That's it?

2479
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,580
Okay, so I have to call...

2480
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:50,940
I should call down the other thing.

2481
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,660
No, I meant like the secret path.

2482
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:56,880
Wait, how do I...

2483
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:00,460
Okay, I should do that then.

2484
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,560
No, I meant the path down there.

2485
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:08,600
No, I meant the...

2486
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,760
The secret path down there.

2487
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:11,400
Was that everything in the secret path?

2488
02:04:19,410 --> 02:04:20,110
Down there?

2489
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:21,670
Wait, there's more?

2490
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:22,550
What did I miss?

2491
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:25,410
Wait, what did I miss in the secret path?

2492
02:04:29,550 --> 02:04:31,170
Oh, the secret was the...

2493
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:32,390
Okay, I got everything in there.

2494
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:33,670
Okay, I'm gonna grab...

2495
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:35,450
I'm gonna grab...

2496
02:04:35,950 --> 02:04:36,870
Get meds.

2497
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:39,390
And then like head down for the other...

2498
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:41,670
Yeah, I went under the...

2499
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:43,070
The dungeon area.

2500
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:44,590
I wanna...

2501
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:49,870
Okay, I'm gonna go get my meds.

2502
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:52,510
Wait, wait a minute.

2503
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:53,110
This way.

2504
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:55,910
Alright.

2505
02:04:56,150 --> 02:04:57,610
We'll go more for the dungeon.

2506
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:02,170
Because I have zero HP now.

2507
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:05,530
Alright.

2508
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,650
No, I just...

2509
02:05:06,650 --> 02:05:07,830
I have zero...

2510
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:08,410
Flask.

2511
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:10,470
So I'm just getting my flask before I do this.

2512
02:05:13,690 --> 02:05:15,970
Actually, I don't have to kill them.

2513
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:19,690
Okay.

2514
02:05:20,810 --> 02:05:23,110
Okay, now I do have to...

2515
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:24,870
Now I will kill them.

2516
02:05:25,790 --> 02:05:26,470
Okay.

2517
02:05:29,570 --> 02:05:30,930
Now I will.

2518
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:38,150
I wasn't thinking about it before.

2519
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:44,750
But now I have to.

2520
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:46,030
Now it's serious.

2521
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:50,720
Yeah.

2522
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,120
It was this way.

2523
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:53,340
I got lost somehow.

2524
02:05:59,220 --> 02:05:59,660
Yeah.

2525
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:03,720
Now it's personal.

2526
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:08,360
Alright.

2527
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,620
Down we go.

2528
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,340
Down, down, down, down.

2529
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:16,400
Dots are down.

2530
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:18,380
Then it's this way.

2531
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:19,240
And then left.

2532
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:21,320
Wait, can I equip one more talisman?

2533
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,420
I didn't even notice that.

2534
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:24,140
Oh, I can!

2535
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:27,080
What do I have on?

2536
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:30,660
Uh...

2537
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:31,400
Raises focus.

2538
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:32,640
Raises vitality.

2539
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,260
Critical elements.

2540
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,900
All sound made by the wearer.

2541
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:38,800
Oh.

2542
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:40,440
I like vitality.

2543
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,480
Vitality is always nice.

2544
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:48,390
Wait, actually, what the fuck does vitality mean?

2545
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:50,690
Wait, I'm like...

2546
02:06:50,690 --> 02:06:51,570
Wait, I don't think...

2547
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:52,970
I'm like, wait a minute.

2548
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:55,230
What does vitality even mean?

2549
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:56,390
Okay, I like focus.

2550
02:06:57,110 --> 02:06:57,430
That's...

2551
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:57,990
Oh my god.

2552
02:06:58,150 --> 02:06:59,870
What the fuck am I...

2553
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:03,470
What does focus do?

2554
02:07:03,470 --> 02:07:03,550
What do you do?

2555
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:10,110
Wait, wait.

2556
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:11,330
Okay, give me a sec.

2557
02:07:12,650 --> 02:07:13,910
Yeah, I kept thinking...

2558
02:07:15,110 --> 02:07:15,490
Vitality...

2559
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:16,750
Um...

2560
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:17,210
Um...

2561
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:18,190
Is like, vigor.

2562
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:19,650
But I was like, oh wait, that's not it.

2563
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:24,030
Blue dagger?

2564
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:24,330
This?

2565
02:07:24,530 --> 02:07:25,370
It's the critical hit?

2566
02:07:30,370 --> 02:07:31,610
Oh, no insta-death?

2567
02:07:32,210 --> 02:07:32,990
I like that.

2568
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:38,550
Oh, it's PvP.

2569
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:39,130
Okay.

2570
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:40,950
And I'll just...

2571
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:42,050
I'll just do this one then.

2572
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:44,970
I'll just do the critical hit shit.

2573
02:07:47,070 --> 02:07:48,090
What the fuck?

2574
02:07:48,230 --> 02:07:49,330
They can throw shit now?

2575
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:51,710
Well, that's not fair.

2576
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:55,970
Oh my god.

2577
02:07:56,150 --> 02:07:57,030
This is not your fight!

2578
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:00,430
That's it.

2579
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:01,290
This is now your fight.

2580
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:02,530
That's fucking it.

2581
02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:05,150
You could've stayed in your lane.

2582
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:12,560
Alright.

2583
02:08:15,650 --> 02:08:16,550
That's fucking right.

2584
02:08:16,650 --> 02:08:17,610
Get out of here!

2585
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:25,330
Alright, down we go.

2586
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:32,100
Down, down, down.

2587
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:34,020
Down we go.

2588
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:36,540
No down ahead.

2589
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:37,560
Okay, that's good to know.

2590
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,440
What does this say?

2591
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,580
Liar ahead and then no horse ahead.

2592
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:44,720
Wait, who's the liar?

2593
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:52,240
Okay, yeah.

2594
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:53,720
I'm pretty sure there's no down ahead.

2595
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,380
Like, who's the liar?

2596
02:09:05,190 --> 02:09:05,970
Liar ahead.

2597
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:06,470
Oh, hey.

2598
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:08,970
Good pot?

2599
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:12,030
Good pot or bad pot?

2600
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:16,220
Good pot.

2601
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:16,920
Bad pot.

2602
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:17,400
Bad pot.

2603
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:18,480
Bad pot.

2604
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:19,100
Bad pot.

2605
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:22,540
That's a very bad pot.

2606
02:09:27,870 --> 02:09:28,950
That's fucking right.

2607
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:30,350
I know what you are!

2608
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:36,520
We're dashing through.

2609
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:38,420
Ambush ahead.

2610
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:44,190
Where's the ambush?

2611
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,400
Oh my god!

2612
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:51,480
Wait.

2613
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,580
I think he's too fat.

2614
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:57,720
Wait a minute.

2615
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:58,440
For what?

2616
02:09:58,560 --> 02:09:58,860
Wait, no.

2617
02:09:58,940 --> 02:09:59,980
All of this is too big.

2618
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:00,920
Oh my god.

2619
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:01,540
Give me a sec.

2620
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:02,720
Give me a...

2621
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:07,600
Never mind.

2622
02:10:07,860 --> 02:10:08,440
He can't...

2623
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,640
He can go through all of this.

2624
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:17,020
Wait, unless...

2625
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:17,780
I don't think he goes...

2626
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:18,180
Wait, okay.

2627
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:19,540
Okay, wait.

2628
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:20,320
I figured this out.

2629
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:21,000
Mike!

2630
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,480
Thank you for the...

2631
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:23,360
To get the shits.

2632
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:24,360
Thank you, thank you.

2633
02:10:31,870 --> 02:10:32,770
Oh my god.

2634
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,650
What am I gonna do with this giant nice pot?

2635
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:41,420
What's over here?

2636
02:10:47,170 --> 02:10:49,390
Oh my god, it's a little baby.

2637
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:52,070
Little baby is following me.

2638
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:55,530
I don't think he can fit up here.

2639
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:02,840
Yeah, I was right.

2640
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:03,260
I was right.

2641
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,570
Alright, that was my bad.

2642
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:12,330
I literally walked into that trap.

2643
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:15,050
I walked into that.

2644
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:16,730
Who's lying?

2645
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:23,920
I can't tell who's lying!

2646
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:30,000
Who's telling the truth?

2647
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:32,340
And who's not?

2648
02:11:38,110 --> 02:11:40,430
I don't know!

2649
02:11:43,490 --> 02:11:44,930
Oh my god!

2650
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,720
Oh my god.

2651
02:11:58,780 --> 02:11:59,880
It'll explode, right?

2652
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:07,450
Where is it?

2653
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:14,270
Okay, there you go.

2654
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:19,420
This way.

2655
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,500
And then we'll just run here.

2656
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:26,870
Wait.

2657
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:32,560
This?

2658
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:35,420
What's wrong with this little guy?

2659
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:37,060
I don't wanna deal with this little guy.

2660
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:38,620
I don't wanna deal with this little guy.

2661
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,420
I feel like this little guy is gonna be a big little guy.

2662
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:46,970
Which one's the boss?

2663
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:55,060
Which one's the boss?

2664
02:12:55,060 --> 02:12:56,860
What's the worst that could happen?

2665
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:58,040
A lot of things!

2666
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:58,980
I don't know.

2667
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:03,200
Oh my god, I'm gonna get poisoned.

2668
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,140
I'm gonna get poisoned.

2669
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:05,140
I'm gonna get poisoned.

2670
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:06,560
I got too cocky.

2671
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:15,800
I'll just walk past this.

2672
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:19,800
I'll just walk past it.

2673
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:21,980
That's fine.

2674
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:24,160
That's fine.

2675
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:26,180
I don't need to fight all of that.

2676
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:26,900
That's...

2677
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,360
That's fine.

2678
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:28,260
Oh my god!

2679
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:29,900
Why is there so many a pot?

2680
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:30,040
What?

2681
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,360
Good pot or bad pot?

2682
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,180
Good pot.

2683
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:39,620
Wait, what's down here?

2684
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:44,140
I don't know if I should go down there.

2685
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:46,620
Everything seems dangerous.

2686
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,180
Okay, okay.

2687
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:50,060
That's a big boy.

2688
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:55,130
Okay.

2689
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:56,830
Okay.

2690
02:13:57,630 --> 02:13:58,410
Oh, nice.

2691
02:13:58,570 --> 02:13:59,290
Oh, I can kill him!

2692
02:14:02,410 --> 02:14:03,050
Yeah.

2693
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:05,710
That's fucking right.

2694
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:12,660
Crack.

2695
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:14,500
Yoink!

2696
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:15,680
My loot now.

2697
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:17,740
I'm a genius.

2698
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:20,740
I didn't notice it, but I'm a genius.

2699
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:24,220
Alright, down we go.

2700
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:29,540
Oh, it's here again.

2701
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:34,990
Wait, where do I go after that?

2702
02:14:38,990 --> 02:14:41,050
Wait, there's no lever down here.

2703
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,100
Wait, what?

2704
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:51,960
This is where the pot guy was before.

2705
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:54,900
Isn't it?

2706
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,100
Oh no, this is new!

2707
02:14:56,660 --> 02:14:57,600
Oh no, this is new!

2708
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:57,960
Okay.

2709
02:15:03,530 --> 02:15:05,910
Still no lever, still no lever.

2710
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:08,630
Lever ahead, therefore seek down.

2711
02:15:13,190 --> 02:15:15,230
Wait, where am I?

2712
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:27,340
Wait, where am I?

2713
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:32,820
Wait, what?

2714
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:52,680
Oh!

2715
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:57,580
I go down!

2716
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:06,340
There's a big-ass pot.

2717
02:16:13,490 --> 02:16:16,050
I'm faster, I'm faster, I'm faster, I'm faster, I'm faster.

2718
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:20,570
Oh my god, where am I?

2719
02:16:20,790 --> 02:16:21,770
Oh, there it is.

2720
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:25,510
Oh my god!

2721
02:16:26,230 --> 02:16:26,670
Children!

2722
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:29,550
Okay.

2723
02:16:37,670 --> 02:16:38,470
Okay, it's this way.

2724
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:43,670
And then...

2725
02:16:44,670 --> 02:16:45,490
Go up.

2726
02:16:45,890 --> 02:16:46,390
Bye.

2727
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:50,070
Okay, we did it.

2728
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:51,090
We got the pot.

2729
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:54,130
We did it.

2730
02:16:55,050 --> 02:16:57,410
Alright, now we can fight the boss.

2731
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:03,600
And not the children.

2732
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,560
Oh my god.

2733
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:08,380
The scariest thing in the world.

2734
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:09,900
It will go up.

2735
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:18,560
I know I need to press a button to cancel, but I'm scared I'm going to accidentally fall off.

2736
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:26,850
Let me make sure I'm at the top first before I do anything else.

2737
02:17:29,270 --> 02:17:29,750
Uh...

2738
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:35,610
No, no, I want to get my potions back before I do the thing.

2739
02:17:37,830 --> 02:17:39,390
I'm just getting my potions back.

2740
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:48,670
Alright.

2741
02:17:49,050 --> 02:17:50,370
How much do I need for upgrade?

2742
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:53,550
I know I don't have any souls on me right now.

2743
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:55,050
Or runes on me.

2744
02:17:56,050 --> 02:17:56,590
A 37.

2745
02:17:56,910 --> 02:17:58,150
I can farm that here.

2746
02:17:58,370 --> 02:17:59,090
I'll farm that here.

2747
02:17:59,910 --> 02:18:00,750
Cause like...

2748
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:03,170
I don't want to lose all of it in the middle of the boss fight.

2749
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:04,110
So I'll just farm it here.

2750
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:10,680
Yeah, how much do they give again?

2751
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:13,200
Okay, they give...

2752
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,860
Oh yeah, that's like almost 1k each.

2753
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:15,840
That's fine.

2754
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:18,820
There we go.

2755
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:20,940
Alright, get over here.

2756
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:28,220
And if I die here, at least I'm dying next to the stuff, though.

2757
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:29,980
Okay.

2758
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:33,680
Alright, get over here.

2759
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:34,440
That's right!

2760
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,300
Oh fuck.

2761
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,980
Alright, nice.

2762
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,240
That's 30...

2763
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:44,560
32, and then I'll reset you.

2764
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:50,540
I'll talk to her after I level up, so I can hold her hand.

2765
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:54,000
Alright.

2766
02:18:54,780 --> 02:18:56,450
I just gotta do this like...

2767
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,040
3 more times.

2768
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,140
Okay, nice.

2769
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:09,300
Alright.

2770
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:12,760
And then...

2771
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:13,400
Get over here.

2772
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:15,540
I need your souls!

2773
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:17,900
Get over here!

2774
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:20,700
That's fucking right!

2775
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:21,820
Defeated!

2776
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:25,540
Your purpose here is to level me up!

2777
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:28,320
That's right!

2778
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:31,000
That's your only purpose!

2779
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,380
No, I don't have any, uh...

2780
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:34,340
Runesos on me.

2781
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:38,200
Alright.

2782
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:41,080
One more last time.

2783
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:42,300
Alright.

2784
02:19:42,660 --> 02:19:45,500
While I'm doing the last level up fight...

2785
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:48,800
Pick my next thing to level up, guys.

2786
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:50,660
Decide amongst yourself.

2787
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:52,580
The Council of Dragoons!

2788
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:53,460
Figure it out!

2789
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:55,320
Figure out what...

2790
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:55,660
Oh shit!

2791
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:57,640
Oh shit!

2792
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:02,020
Oh shit!

2793
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:03,440
Council of Dragoons!

2794
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,020
Figure out what I need to do next!

2795
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:11,960
Oh shit!

2796
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:12,440
What the fuck?

2797
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:18,530
Oh, yeah.

2798
02:20:18,690 --> 02:20:19,970
Fuck that one guy in particular.

2799
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:23,210
Oh, yeah.

2800
02:20:23,410 --> 02:20:23,650
That's right.

2801
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:24,410
Get out of here.

2802
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:25,490
Alright.

2803
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:28,070
I have enough now.

2804
02:20:33,790 --> 02:20:35,190
Alright, what did you guys decide?

2805
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:36,230
Oh wait, I don't have enough.

2806
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:36,530
Fuck!

2807
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:37,250
I need one more!

2808
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:38,890
I need a...

2809
02:20:38,890 --> 02:20:39,530
Nevermind!

2810
02:20:39,730 --> 02:20:40,530
You still have more time!

2811
02:20:41,250 --> 02:20:42,350
I need one more!

2812
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:45,550
Apparently.

2813
02:20:47,550 --> 02:20:48,870
I'm just missing one more.

2814
02:20:53,430 --> 02:20:54,530
Okay, now I have enough.

2815
02:20:56,530 --> 02:20:57,450
I'm pretty sure.

2816
02:21:01,890 --> 02:21:02,330
Alright.

2817
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:07,850
Alright!

2818
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:09,690
Which one is it?

2819
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:10,950
Vigor?

2820
02:21:11,470 --> 02:21:13,550
I see Vigor and Arcane.

2821
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:22,350
Vigor or Arcane?

2822
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:25,590
Arcane.

2823
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:26,790
Arcane.

2824
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:29,010
Uh...

2825
02:21:29,010 --> 02:21:29,870
Oh my god, you're right!

2826
02:21:30,170 --> 02:21:32,210
I can talk to her and then she'll hold my hand.

2827
02:21:34,670 --> 02:21:36,690
Think not of the kindling.

2828
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:38,370
I shall see to that.

2829
02:21:38,850 --> 02:21:45,350
All I ask of you is to make the journey to the snowy mountain tops of the giants.

2830
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:47,670
Far above the clouds.

2831
02:21:48,010 --> 02:21:48,910
I know.

2832
02:21:49,290 --> 02:21:52,330
I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.

2833
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:53,930
Oh baby, I'll sin for you.

2834
02:21:55,030 --> 02:21:56,990
I'll eat that apple for you.

2835
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:03,190
As long as you hold my hand.

2836
02:22:11,850 --> 02:22:28,510
As long as you hold my hand.

2837
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:28,650
Fuck!

2838
02:22:28,730 --> 02:22:29,890
Wait, does she come back?

2839
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:30,790
Does she come back?

2840
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:35,070
No!

2841
02:22:35,950 --> 02:22:36,770
I was gonna...

2842
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:37,950
I was gonna...

2843
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:38,470
I was gonna...

2844
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:40,130
I was gonna take off my gloves.

2845
02:22:40,130 --> 02:22:41,130
I thought...

2846
02:22:41,130 --> 02:22:41,550
No!

2847
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:43,990
I fumbled!

2848
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:45,150
I fumbled!

2849
02:22:45,350 --> 02:22:45,690
God!

2850
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,130
No!

2851
02:22:46,670 --> 02:22:48,390
I was gonna take off my gloves!

2852
02:22:48,850 --> 02:22:49,290
I...

2853
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:51,870
I was gonna take off my gloves!

2854
02:22:52,730 --> 02:22:52,890
I was gonna take off my gloves!

2855
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:52,930
Oh!

2856
02:22:56,690 --> 02:22:58,250
It's my chance!

2857
02:22:58,570 --> 02:22:59,290
I fumbled!

2858
02:22:59,590 --> 02:22:59,710
Yes!

2859
02:23:00,110 --> 02:23:01,590
I fumbled!

2860
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:03,070
My wife!

2861
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:04,530
Okay.

2862
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:05,250
Okay.

2863
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:06,370
Arcane or bigger?

2864
02:23:06,670 --> 02:23:08,710
What did we decide on?

2865
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:12,230
No!

2866
02:23:12,650 --> 02:23:14,170
I can't believe I fumbled it!

2867
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:15,830
I can't believe it!

2868
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:16,810
She was right there!

2869
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:22,340
Okay, I see arcane.

2870
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:25,800
I can't believe it.

2871
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:27,580
I have to level up by myself.

2872
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,440
Like a maidenless fool.

2873
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:36,280
Alright, we are this way.

2874
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:39,960
Oh!

2875
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:40,620
Shit!

2876
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:43,460
Oh my god, bro.

2877
02:23:43,580 --> 02:23:44,260
Fuck this, actually.

2878
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:47,040
Fuck this.

2879
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:48,460
I'm resetting this dungeon.

2880
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,240
Like, you can chase me all you want, but I'm resetting this dungeon.

2881
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:00,080
Alright.

2882
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:04,680
Alright.

2883
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,180
Reset we go.

2884
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:09,200
Wait, is that thing still in me?

2885
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:10,040
What the fuck?

2886
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:14,040
Fumbled it like a maidenless scrub!

2887
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:18,700
I can't believe I fumbled it!

2888
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:20,620
I squandered it!

2889
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:27,780
Okay, I wanna make sure I don't use any of my MP for this.

2890
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:34,600
Okay.

2891
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:39,820
Jeez, what?

2892
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:40,800
That still hit me?

2893
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:42,700
Really?

2894
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:46,760
Oh my god.

2895
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:47,340
Are you serious?

2896
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,260
I missed you?

2897
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:51,440
Okay.

2898
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,900
I'm just gonna heal up right now.

2899
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:58,340
Are you serious?

2900
02:24:58,440 --> 02:24:59,380
Oh my god!

2901
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:00,540
Okay, that's it.

2902
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:03,400
Get out of here!

2903
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:04,600
It's not overkill!

2904
02:25:05,300 --> 02:25:06,660
I deserve this!

2905
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:13,390
Alright, now we can fucking go to the boss room now.

2906
02:25:18,010 --> 02:25:20,610
Jesus Christ, there's a knife sticking out of my arm.

2907
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:27,990
Alright, I don't know...

2908
02:25:27,990 --> 02:25:30,810
What this boss fight is gonna be like.

2909
02:25:31,590 --> 02:25:32,150
So...

2910
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:35,590
We're gonna have a little safety message real quick.

2911
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,060
There we go.

2912
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:47,540
Head ahead.

2913
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:53,540
First off, well done.

2914
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:58,060
Monstrosity?

2915
02:25:58,300 --> 02:25:59,800
Wait, who the fuck are we fighting?

2916
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:02,480
Who is that ugly?

2917
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:05,340
Ugly.

2918
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:06,280
Where is this ugly man?

2919
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,120
Oh my god.

2920
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:09,180
Oh my god.

2921
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:10,100
He is very ugly.

2922
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:11,440
Oh my god!

2923
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:12,460
I'm sorry for calling you ugly.

2924
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:13,100
I'm so sorry.

2925
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:13,720
I'm so sorry.

2926
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:14,200
Alright.

2927
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:14,940
Hahaha!

2928
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:17,040
Hahaha!

2929
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:18,420
Hahaha!

2930
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:21,020
Be careful of who you called ugly in high school!

2931
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:21,880
Hahaha!

2932
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:24,740
What the fuck?

2933
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:25,500
What...

2934
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:26,280
What is this?

2935
02:26:26,360 --> 02:26:27,640
I'm so confused.

2936
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:28,320
I'm...

2937
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:29,320
It's just all bodies.

2938
02:26:29,580 --> 02:26:30,540
It's just bodies.

2939
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:31,020
I...

2940
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:33,560
I can't see anything.

2941
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:34,540
It literally...

2942
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:35,440
It's just body.

2943
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:36,580
Hahaha!

2944
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:40,580
He takes up, like, 80% of my screen.

2945
02:26:47,970 --> 02:26:48,410
Okay.

2946
02:26:51,090 --> 02:26:52,710
Like, I'm just so confused.

2947
02:26:58,170 --> 02:26:58,610
Okay.

2948
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:02,700
It's fine.

2949
02:27:05,980 --> 02:27:07,780
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2950
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:09,600
I'm like, oh, shit!

2951
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:12,260
I was like, you gotta hit me.

2952
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:13,600
I'm like, right, I'm below him.

2953
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:16,740
Guys, he indeed, he's hitting me.

2954
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:18,780
Guys, he is indeed hitting me right now.

2955
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:25,000
I am low-key very confused, though.

2956
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:28,920
I can't...

2957
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:34,220
Like, he takes up so much of my screen that I'm just...

2958
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,600
I'm so confused.

2959
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:44,380
I'm like, I feel like I can't dodge just because of how fucking...

2960
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:46,260
Just how much he takes.

2961
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:52,900
Alright.

2962
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:55,600
Jesus Christ.

2963
02:27:59,510 --> 02:28:00,130
There we go.

2964
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:05,430
He's...

2965
02:28:05,430 --> 02:28:06,490
He's so low.

2966
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:07,430
Please!

2967
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:08,710
He was so low!

2968
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:13,680
Oh my god, are you serious?

2969
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:17,360
Please.

2970
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:20,800
Oh my god, I got him!

2971
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:21,120
Oh!

2972
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:22,540
Thank god!

2973
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:25,040
Thank god!

2974
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:25,820
Nice.

2975
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:26,940
A gold seed.

2976
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,020
Let's go.

2977
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:29,780
Oh wait, I got a chest, too!

2978
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:32,160
Yay!

2979
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:36,040
Chest!

2980
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:37,980
Yay!

2981
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:39,840
Wait, what the fuck?

2982
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:40,880
Why do I get a death root?

2983
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:43,920
Alright, let's go back.

2984
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:47,800
I'll laugh for a seed.

2985
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:52,200
Hey, but it is a golden seed.

2986
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:54,920
It is a golden seed, though.

2987
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:56,860
I'll get to level up again.

2988
02:28:57,220 --> 02:28:57,420
Alright.

2989
02:28:58,820 --> 02:28:59,560
Vigor.

2990
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:00,920
Dexterity.

2991
02:29:02,190 --> 02:29:02,860
Arcane strength.

2992
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:06,480
Alright.

2993
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,680
I got P. So, discuss amongst yourself.

2994
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:11,480
My dragoon council.

2995
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:25,790
Alright.

2996
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:26,990
What have you decided?

2997
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:30,570
Arcane?

2998
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:32,070
Alright.

2999
02:30:32,610 --> 02:30:35,470
Arcane till 20 and then more endurance.

3000
02:30:35,850 --> 02:30:35,970
Okay.

3001
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:38,930
The council has spoken.

3002
02:30:40,850 --> 02:30:42,190
Alright, we leave now.

3003
02:30:43,290 --> 02:30:44,290
We did our job.

3004
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:48,750
Alright, off we go.

3005
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:50,290
We're out to see the wizard.

3006
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:51,990
The wonderful wizard of Oz.

3007
02:30:53,850 --> 02:30:56,370
I'm gonna get the jellyfish here, because I don't trust myself.

3008
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:02,220
Kill him first.

3009
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:04,680
You think he knows?

3010
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:06,240
I think he knew.

3011
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:10,980
Okay.

3012
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:13,840
And then...

3013
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:16,000
Get rid of these guys.

3014
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:16,760
The little guys.

3015
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:19,740
And then...

3016
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,040
I'll get rid of the little guys.

3017
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:23,960
Because I feel like...

3018
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:25,980
The little guys will help the big man.

3019
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:27,980
If, like, he, they know.

3020
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:31,740
Like, I have a feeling.

3021
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:31,760
Okay.

3022
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:35,520
Alright.

3023
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:37,060
What the fuck?

3024
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:37,500
You're alive?

3025
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:38,920
I was just swinging my...

3026
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:40,820
My sword for decoration.

3027
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:44,840
Oh, shit.

3028
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:45,260
Okay.

3029
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:46,300
That is...

3030
02:31:46,300 --> 02:31:47,700
Oh, my God.

3031
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:48,320
Oh, my God.

3032
02:31:48,380 --> 02:31:49,520
My child's gonna die soon.

3033
02:31:52,180 --> 02:31:53,040
Oh, my God.

3034
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:53,920
He is so strong.

3035
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:55,380
Wait, he is so strong.

3036
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:56,400
He is so...

3037
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:56,920
Oh, my God.

3038
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:56,940
Oh, my God.

3039
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:58,020
He has a fucking whip.

3040
02:32:00,100 --> 02:32:01,000
Oh, my God.

3041
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:01,760
My child's dead.

3042
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:06,020
But, like...

3043
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:06,240
Yo!

3044
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:06,920
Ah!

3045
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:08,740
Ah!

3046
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:10,640
Holy shit.

3047
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:11,620
Oh, my God.

3048
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:12,500
Oh, my God.

3049
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:13,020
He is so strong.

3050
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:15,520
I didn't think he'd be that strong.

3051
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:20,880
Ah!

3052
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:22,960
Holy fuck.

3053
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,000
Holy fuck.

3054
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:28,260
Okay.

3055
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,820
Maybe I can cheese it a little bit.

3056
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:30,660
Maybe?

3057
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,980
Guys, I can't cheese it.

3058
02:32:32,020 --> 02:32:32,700
I can't cheese it.

3059
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:33,220
It has...

3060
02:32:33,220 --> 02:32:34,220
It has blood.

3061
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:35,100
It has...

3062
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:35,980
It has bleed.

3063
02:32:36,700 --> 02:32:38,720
I thought bleed was a me thing.

3064
02:32:43,550 --> 02:32:44,990
Oh, my God.

3065
02:32:45,010 --> 02:32:45,910
That's a fire!

3066
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:46,390
Damn!

3067
02:32:48,390 --> 02:32:49,510
Oh, my God.

3068
02:32:49,630 --> 02:32:50,310
I'm fucking dead.

3069
02:32:53,290 --> 02:32:54,490
Oh, my God.

3070
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:56,510
My jellyfish sacrificed herself.

3071
02:32:57,170 --> 02:32:57,650
For this.

3072
02:32:58,990 --> 02:33:00,750
That's starting to stand.

3073
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:07,310
Oh, my God.

3074
02:33:07,430 --> 02:33:07,490
Oh, my God.

3075
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:07,990
It doesn't stop.

3076
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:09,590
It doesn't stop!

3077
02:33:11,290 --> 02:33:11,810
Holy...

3078
02:33:11,810 --> 02:33:12,510
Oh, my God!

3079
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,290
Oh, my God!

3080
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:15,230
Oh!

3081
02:33:17,170 --> 02:33:18,390
Bro, what else can she do?

3082
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:22,350
Okay.

3083
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:26,780
Okay.

3084
02:33:26,780 --> 02:33:26,820
Okay.

3085
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:35,440
I don't know why I did all that.

3086
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,960
Holy shit.

3087
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:40,780
I don't know how none of that hit me.

3088
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:41,820
That was crazy.

3089
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,680
None of that hit me.

3090
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:47,320
Okay.

3091
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:49,120
First off.

3092
02:33:49,640 --> 02:33:50,120
Okay.

3093
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:52,980
I don't know why none of that hit me there.

3094
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:55,240
But I'll take it.

3095
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:59,600
I'm not gonna run because I feel that if I start running, I'll fall off.

3096
02:34:04,930 --> 02:34:06,610
Oh, I can't take this.

3097
02:34:10,690 --> 02:34:15,630
Wait, is that... Does that guy have an arrow?

3098
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:19,530
Okay, let's pull here first.

3099
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:22,210
Okay, that guy has an arrow.

3100
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:27,000
That guy gonna shoot me?

3101
02:34:28,260 --> 02:34:29,680
Oh, please don't.

3102
02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:37,910
Still so lonely.

3103
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:42,730
Oh my god.

3104
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:43,450
Okay, I'm running.

3105
02:34:43,570 --> 02:34:43,870
I'm running.

3106
02:34:44,010 --> 02:34:44,410
I'm running.

3107
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:44,970
I'm running.

3108
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:46,330
I'm running.

3109
02:34:46,710 --> 02:34:48,450
I'm... I'm running.

3110
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:49,030
I'm running.

3111
02:34:49,030 --> 02:34:49,590
I'm running.

3112
02:34:51,570 --> 02:34:52,950
Oh my god.

3113
02:34:53,250 --> 02:34:54,890
Oh my god.

3114
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:55,990
Please.

3115
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:57,110
Please go faster.

3116
02:34:57,330 --> 02:34:57,810
Please.

3117
02:34:58,950 --> 02:34:59,930
Please go faster.

3118
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:00,830
Please go faster.

3119
02:35:01,010 --> 02:35:01,790
Please go faster.

3120
02:35:01,910 --> 02:35:01,910
Please go faster.

3121
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:02,210
Please.

3122
02:35:02,330 --> 02:35:02,890
Oh, thank god.

3123
02:35:02,890 --> 02:35:03,590
He hit the wall.

3124
02:35:03,890 --> 02:35:04,590
We're alive.

3125
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:10,180
We're alive.

3126
02:35:10,820 --> 02:35:11,540
We're alive.

3127
02:35:13,140 --> 02:35:13,460
Oh...

3128
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:13,980
No!

3129
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:14,900
Shit!

3130
02:35:16,460 --> 02:35:17,420
Oh god.

3131
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:18,820
We're still alive.

3132
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:23,260
Okay, we'll just go this way.

3133
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:25,880
Oh.

3134
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:29,120
Saw my life flash before me right there.

3135
02:35:30,900 --> 02:35:32,680
Oh, thank god there's a grace here.

3136
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:39,820
Nice.

3137
02:35:44,730 --> 02:35:45,870
A broken bond.

3138
02:35:46,010 --> 02:35:46,850
Thank you for the super chat.

3139
02:35:46,970 --> 02:35:47,670
Thank you, thank you.

3140
02:35:47,790 --> 02:35:49,710
Doki will beat a boss in the first try.

3141
02:35:50,030 --> 02:35:52,450
But we'll get bodied by a rat for like 20 easily...

3142
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,270
Easily avoidable deaths.

3143
02:35:57,450 --> 02:35:58,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3144
02:35:58,350 --> 02:35:59,450
Thank you, thank you.

3145
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:05,220
Alright, we're safe now.

3146
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:09,200
We're pretty safe here.

3147
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:13,880
In these lands.

3148
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:17,700
I feel oakly-dokly.

3149
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:17,740
I feel oakly-dokly.

3150
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:21,980
Where do I go, though?

3151
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:25,400
Why is there ghost trees?

3152
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:31,420
Who killed these ghost trees?

3153
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:33,060
Who made these trees in them?

3154
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:35,980
What kind of unfinished business do these trees have?

3155
02:36:39,730 --> 02:36:40,990
Lover or lover.

3156
02:36:41,750 --> 02:36:42,310
Sound?

3157
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:53,260
Yeah, but what kind of unfinished business do they have?

3158
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,000
They become a ghost because they have unfinished business.

3159
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:57,860
They're a fucking tree.

3160
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:00,560
You know that?

3161
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:02,860
Get up.

3162
02:37:04,340 --> 02:37:05,320
I go right?

3163
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:06,380
Guys, right or left?

3164
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:14,480
I'm gonna avoid that.

3165
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:16,020
To grow.

3166
02:37:16,180 --> 02:37:17,640
I didn't let them grow.

3167
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:24,360
I'm going right.

3168
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:31,440
I'm gonna fight these guys.

3169
02:37:32,760 --> 02:37:34,000
Why is he red?

3170
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:38,020
I have red eyes.

3171
02:37:44,030 --> 02:37:44,610
I have red eyes.

3172
02:37:44,610 --> 02:37:45,670
Oh shit.

3173
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:51,540
I'm just gonna ride my horse.

3174
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:54,340
I feel like there's no reason to walk.

3175
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:55,980
Is he sleeping or dead?

3176
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:58,220
He lies many mysteries.

3177
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:04,050
Can't tell if he's breathing.

3178
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:07,830
I assume he must be sleeping.

3179
02:38:09,810 --> 02:38:11,090
Maybe they're nice.

3180
02:38:12,990 --> 02:38:14,950
In the land of Elden Ring?

3181
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:15,550
Yeah.

3182
02:38:16,010 --> 02:38:16,470
Sure.

3183
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:25,730
They're either crazy or they're here to kill me.

3184
02:38:25,890 --> 02:38:26,650
There's no in between.

3185
02:38:33,540 --> 02:38:34,300
Oh hey.

3186
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:38,080
Oh that's cool.

3187
02:38:42,580 --> 02:38:43,940
And see like...

3188
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:47,420
What am I looking at though?

3189
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:51,060
So beautiful.

3190
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:53,380
Oh there's the tree!

3191
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:00,080
Story path is...

3192
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:00,680
South?

3193
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:02,140
Oh so this way.

3194
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:04,680
That makes sense.

3195
02:39:04,820 --> 02:39:06,760
I have to go this way and then...

3196
02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:14,280
Like this and...

3197
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:15,480
Wait how do I get up here though?

3198
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:18,940
I'm so confused.

3199
02:39:26,690 --> 02:39:28,250
Straight path is on the lake?

3200
02:39:28,450 --> 02:39:29,210
Is this the lake?

3201
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:31,630
Alright I'm grabbing my horse.

3202
02:39:31,690 --> 02:39:31,890
Horse!

3203
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:36,790
We go straight horse!

3204
02:39:39,970 --> 02:39:41,870
Surely this is the right path right?

3205
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:41,970
Okay.

3206
02:39:43,550 --> 02:39:45,190
There's so many jellyfish.

3207
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:48,610
If we're time for horseback battle.

3208
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:49,950
Okay there's a dragon here.

3209
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:51,770
Okay.

3210
02:39:52,190 --> 02:39:53,950
There's a dragon here somewhere.

3211
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:56,550
So many ghost animals.

3212
02:39:59,550 --> 02:40:00,850
I knew it.

3213
02:40:01,170 --> 02:40:02,890
I fucking knew it.

3214
02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:05,310
I knew you existed.

3215
02:40:07,770 --> 02:40:09,290
Wait can I kill him?

3216
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:12,750
Is this possible?

3217
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:13,850
How strong are you?

3218
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:16,970
Okay now he's flying.

3219
02:40:26,450 --> 02:40:27,050
Alright.

3220
02:40:27,550 --> 02:40:28,450
How strong are you?

3221
02:40:28,590 --> 02:40:29,490
Okay little...

3222
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:30,450
Okay you whore!

3223
02:40:30,610 --> 02:40:31,790
Get down from here!

3224
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:36,390
How the fuck am I supposed to do anything?

3225
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:40,030
Alright.

3226
02:40:40,610 --> 02:40:42,270
Now I can fight you right?

3227
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:45,830
Okay now...

3228
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:46,470
Fuck this.

3229
02:40:46,570 --> 02:40:47,430
I'm not even gonna...

3230
02:40:47,430 --> 02:40:49,010
I'm not even giving you the stats.

3231
02:40:49,610 --> 02:40:50,550
I'm not even gonna get off my horse.

3232
02:40:50,750 --> 02:40:52,090
Okay I'm getting off my horse.

3233
02:40:52,230 --> 02:40:52,910
I'm getting off my horse.

3234
02:40:53,050 --> 02:40:53,750
I'm getting off my horse.

3235
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:54,890
I'm getting off my horse.

3236
02:40:55,050 --> 02:40:55,250
I'm getting off my horse.

3237
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:55,850
I'm getting off my horse.

3238
02:40:56,170 --> 02:40:56,530
I'm...

3239
02:41:00,050 --> 02:41:00,770
Never mind.

3240
02:41:02,930 --> 02:41:03,650
Never fucking...

3241
02:41:03,650 --> 02:41:05,030
Oh my god.

3242
02:41:08,050 --> 02:41:10,650
I... oh please, for the love of god.

3243
02:41:12,190 --> 02:41:14,850
I don't even know where my jellyfish is.

3244
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:20,110
Is that the aurora aliboros?

3245
02:41:22,650 --> 02:41:25,170
Please, just let me get closer to you.

3246
02:41:25,370 --> 02:41:31,650
If you fly up, the moment I get to your feet, I swear to god, if you fly up, the moment I'm here.

3247
02:41:33,910 --> 02:41:36,830
I... oh my god, I just got here!

3248
02:41:37,270 --> 02:41:42,050
Oh my... hey, you did say... you said told her to come down, you did...

3249
02:41:44,450 --> 02:41:45,530
Not like that!

3250
02:41:47,710 --> 02:41:49,350
Oh my poor jellyfish.

3251
02:41:49,490 --> 02:41:51,330
My poor fucking jellyfish.

3252
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:01,120
Okay, I'm dead.

3253
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:03,260
There's no way I live through this.

3254
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:09,500
This is actually so bullshit.

3255
02:42:14,910 --> 02:42:16,110
I... I hate him.

3256
02:42:16,270 --> 02:42:17,750
I hate him so much.

3257
02:42:17,890 --> 02:42:18,470
I hate you.

3258
02:42:18,830 --> 02:42:19,870
I hate you.

3259
02:42:20,510 --> 02:42:22,210
I hate... I HATE YOU!

3260
02:42:27,010 --> 02:42:28,250
I hate you.

3261
02:42:28,530 --> 02:42:30,150
I'll just keep shaking your legs.

3262
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:32,030
This is all I can do.

3263
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:38,120
All I can do is just shake his legs.

3264
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:39,700
That's literally it.

3265
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:43,360
Oh my god.

3266
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:45,980
Oh my god, there he goes again!

3267
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:48,580
There he goes again!

3268
02:42:54,180 --> 02:42:54,680
Alright.

3269
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:56,440
Here I go again too!

3270
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:00,700
Oh my god, you're such a little bitch!

3271
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:04,280
Oh, there he goes!

3272
02:43:04,580 --> 02:43:05,500
Alright, fly up!

3273
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:06,180
Just fly!

3274
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:06,960
Just fly!

3275
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:07,680
Oh, dad!

3276
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:08,680
Yeah, fuck you too!

3277
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:08,800
No!

3278
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:20,790
Please, I just...

3279
02:43:22,590 --> 02:43:27,010
Please, just let me fucking stab your stupid ass legs!

3280
02:43:29,850 --> 02:43:31,490
That's all I want.

3281
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:34,250
I hate the dragons so much.

3282
02:43:34,470 --> 02:43:35,890
Cause like...

3283
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:39,530
They're so dumb.

3284
02:43:39,790 --> 02:43:40,310
They're so dumb.

3285
02:43:40,550 --> 02:43:41,710
They're actually so dumb.

3286
02:43:41,890 --> 02:43:42,790
They're so...

3287
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:43,690
Goddamn stupid.

3288
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:45,130
They're so stupid.

3289
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:50,250
Oh my... How?

3290
02:43:50,490 --> 02:43:50,710
How?

3291
02:43:50,950 --> 02:43:51,230
How?

3292
02:43:51,730 --> 02:43:53,010
Where did he go?

3293
02:43:53,850 --> 02:43:54,410
Where...

3294
02:44:11,050 --> 02:44:11,610
He...

3295
02:44:11,610 --> 02:44:12,830
Just let...

3296
02:44:12,830 --> 02:44:13,950
Oh my...

3297
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:19,960
You know what?

3298
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:22,400
I'll wait for the poison to kill you!

3299
02:44:27,380 --> 02:44:27,900
Wait.

3300
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:28,080
Wait.

3301
02:44:28,140 --> 02:44:29,700
If I can stab him and...

3302
02:44:29,700 --> 02:44:30,300
Wait.

3303
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:34,620
I'll just wait for the...

3304
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:36,000
Poison to kill you!

3305
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:39,800
Wait.

3306
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:40,020
What?

3307
02:44:40,180 --> 02:44:40,640
What do you mean?

3308
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:42,240
The poison ran out!

3309
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:43,660
The poison ran out!

3310
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:44,760
Of fucking course!

3311
02:44:45,020 --> 02:44:47,260
The poison ran out the moment I said that.

3312
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:49,000
Cause fuck me, am I right?

3313
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,820
It turned to be later.

3314
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:54,960
It ran out the moment I said that.

3315
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:58,060
It's alright.

3316
02:44:59,340 --> 02:45:01,300
I don't think he knows I'm here.

3317
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:05,000
I will very slowly...

3318
02:45:05,740 --> 02:45:06,880
Okay, it knew.

3319
02:45:07,060 --> 02:45:08,100
It actually knew.

3320
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:10,820
How did you know I was crouch walking?

3321
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:22,620
He knew.

3322
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:26,640
It smelled me.

3323
02:45:32,060 --> 02:45:34,460
He could smell my...

3324
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:36,860
Where am I?

3325
02:45:37,020 --> 02:45:38,120
Oh yeah, it's the lake.

3326
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:42,880
Alright, time to get my stupid runes.

3327
02:45:47,970 --> 02:45:48,590
That's it.

3328
02:45:48,690 --> 02:45:49,550
I'm just gonna fight him.

3329
02:45:49,670 --> 02:45:51,210
Yeah, I'm gonna fight him on my horse.

3330
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,250
Fuck this shit.

3331
02:45:55,630 --> 02:45:57,730
You smelled my...

3332
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:05,780
Alright, time to grab my runes.

3333
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:12,940
Alright, there he comes again.

3334
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:14,260
There he is.

3335
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:16,580
There he is.

3336
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:20,740
Okay, you go do your thing real quick.

3337
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:22,120
I'm gonna grab my runes.

3338
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:30,120
I swear to God, where are you?

3339
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:31,860
Where the fuck are you?

3340
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:34,380
I swear to God, where the fuck are you?

3341
02:46:40,770 --> 02:46:41,770
Get out of here.

3342
02:46:42,530 --> 02:46:43,650
Get your ass out.

3343
02:46:43,810 --> 02:46:44,390
Get your...

3344
02:46:44,390 --> 02:46:45,450
Get your ass out of here.

3345
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:46,590
Get out of here.

3346
02:46:46,590 --> 02:46:46,690
Get- get!

3347
02:46:46,690 --> 02:46:47,370
- get outta here.

3348
02:46:50,790 --> 02:46:53,030
I will fight you on the horse.

3349
02:46:54,750 --> 02:46:56,330
That's the last thing I do.

3350
02:46:57,050 --> 02:46:57,410
Get up.

3351
02:46:57,910 --> 02:46:59,250
Fucking got your toes.

3352
02:46:59,610 --> 02:47:00,950
Got your stupid ass toes.

3353
02:47:04,730 --> 02:47:05,850
All right.

3354
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:06,430
All right.

3355
02:47:06,530 --> 02:47:07,270
You win this hack.

3356
02:47:09,010 --> 02:47:13,310
If just cuz you got my horse doesn't... Oh, never mind.

3357
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,910
Never mind.

3358
02:47:15,530 --> 02:47:16,610
I didn't realize...

3359
02:47:17,370 --> 02:47:20,510
I didn't realize he would need me to fucking pay him.

3360
02:47:20,710 --> 02:47:21,910
To summon him again.

3361
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:26,510
Where is he?

3362
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:27,350
Oh fuck!

3363
02:47:27,930 --> 02:47:28,550
That's on me.

3364
02:47:28,890 --> 02:47:29,670
That's on me.

3365
02:47:29,790 --> 02:47:31,650
I was like, where is he gonna drop this sand?

3366
02:47:31,770 --> 02:47:32,070
Ha ha.

3367
02:47:32,690 --> 02:47:33,650
That's... Oh my!

3368
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:34,730
That's also on me.

3369
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:42,240
This guy is actually so annoying.

3370
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:43,720
Oh my god.

3371
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:47,440
No wonder everyone tried to kill all these dragons here.

3372
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:49,140
No wonder.

3373
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:54,140
It was honestly worth it.

3374
02:47:54,840 --> 02:47:56,980
These dragons do not deserve to be alive.

3375
02:47:57,160 --> 02:47:57,300
Wait!

3376
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:58,560
My jellyfish is dead?

3377
02:48:00,900 --> 02:48:02,760
How did she die so fast?

3378
02:48:08,460 --> 02:48:09,300
I can't.

3379
02:48:09,340 --> 02:48:10,280
I can't use the horse.

3380
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:12,700
I need to use a flask to use the horse.

3381
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:22,180
I walked out of that summoning range.

3382
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:24,500
I didn't even notice that.

3383
02:48:28,020 --> 02:48:30,800
I didn't even notice I walked out of the summoning range.

3384
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:35,100
Oh my god.

3385
02:48:35,260 --> 02:48:35,680
You guys are praised.

3386
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:36,660
Oh my god.

3387
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:38,280
You guys are praised when I was about to heal.

3388
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:39,040
I...

3389
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:43,760
Oopsie daisy.

3390
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:48,660
Oh, I know.

3391
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:49,120
I knew!

3392
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:49,940
I knew he was gonna do it too!

3393
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:51,000
I knew he was gonna do it!

3394
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:52,320
I knew he was gonna do it as well!

3395
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:54,620
I can feel it.

3396
02:48:58,420 --> 02:48:59,600
That's on me.

3397
02:49:05,740 --> 02:49:06,340
Okay.

3398
02:49:12,170 --> 02:49:18,050
I feel like... guys, I have a feeling that I might not succeed in this fight.

3399
02:49:18,470 --> 02:49:19,410
I don't know.

3400
02:49:19,690 --> 02:49:22,250
I don't know why, but I...

3401
02:49:24,290 --> 02:49:30,090
There's... there's a deep suspicion that he might... he might win.

3402
02:49:37,370 --> 02:49:37,930
Okay.

3403
02:49:39,010 --> 02:49:43,470
Like, it's very... his movement is predictable, but...

3404
02:49:43,470 --> 02:49:44,750
I get greedy.

3405
02:49:46,430 --> 02:49:48,470
So, like that.

3406
02:49:48,690 --> 02:49:49,230
Like that.

3407
02:49:49,350 --> 02:49:52,930
I knew he was gonna do that, but I was like, I got one more shot at me.

3408
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:54,210
Truly, right?

3409
02:49:59,330 --> 02:50:00,190
Like right now.

3410
02:50:00,530 --> 02:50:01,770
Like, yeah, I knew it.

3411
02:50:01,870 --> 02:50:02,370
I knew it.

3412
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:08,420
It's so telegraphed.

3413
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:11,600
VTuber, why are you so greedy?

3414
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:13,100
I can't help it!

3415
02:50:13,300 --> 02:50:14,540
It's just there!

3416
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:17,500
Are you serious?

3417
02:50:19,860 --> 02:50:21,880
Guys, can I get a message of praise, please?

3418
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:25,380
Please, just a little bit?

3419
02:50:27,400 --> 02:50:28,080
Nevermind.

3420
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:30,340
I know you won't give me.

3421
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:34,200
Are you serious?

3422
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:36,280
I can't run that!

3423
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:42,040
Oh my god.

3424
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:45,640
Fuck this, I'm leaving.

3425
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:49,300
Fuck this, I'm leaving.

3426
02:50:49,300 --> 02:50:51,460
You go stay in the...

3427
02:50:51,460 --> 02:50:52,520
I can't!

3428
02:50:52,700 --> 02:50:54,680
I don't have a flask!

3429
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:55,700
For the horse!

3430
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:00,520
He killed him!

3431
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:05,420
That's it, I leave.

3432
02:51:06,220 --> 02:51:07,180
Fuck you!

3433
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:10,460
Fuck you!

3434
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:13,280
I don't need to kill you.

3435
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:14,420
I'll be back.

3436
02:51:14,420 --> 02:51:16,180
I'm allowed to leave.

3437
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:17,400
Don't worry, guys.

3438
02:51:17,560 --> 02:51:18,100
I'll come back.

3439
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:21,700
Guys, don't worry.

3440
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,260
I'll come back, guys.

3441
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:32,660
And then she never came back.

3442
02:51:34,180 --> 02:51:37,220
Razor Doki bravely running away.

3443
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:40,800
Don't worry, guys.

3444
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:41,880
I'll come back.

3445
02:51:46,660 --> 02:51:49,360
And she never did come back.

3446
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,640
I'm not a coward!

3447
02:51:54,640 --> 02:51:56,560
I'm pausing the fight!

3448
02:51:56,820 --> 02:51:57,520
I'm just...

3449
02:51:57,520 --> 02:51:59,820
I'm taking a strategic pause.

3450
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:04,120
That's different.

3451
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:04,900
That's different.

3452
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:14,550
It's just a strategic pause.

3453
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:16,050
Nice.

3454
02:52:16,510 --> 02:52:17,370
We actually needed that.

3455
02:52:18,810 --> 02:52:21,370
Can we upgrade any of our...

3456
02:52:21,370 --> 02:52:22,010
Last yet?

3457
02:52:22,130 --> 02:52:22,630
Yes, we can.

3458
02:52:23,610 --> 02:52:24,570
Aw, thank god.

3459
02:52:29,240 --> 02:52:29,840
Alright.

3460
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:30,800
Don't worry.

3461
02:52:31,140 --> 02:52:31,920
We'll be back.

3462
02:52:36,570 --> 02:52:37,850
We'll be back, guys.

3463
02:52:37,970 --> 02:52:38,570
Do not worry.

3464
02:52:43,740 --> 02:52:44,120
Alright.

3465
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:45,180
We'll go here.

3466
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:48,800
Hey, where do we go?

3467
02:52:50,640 --> 02:52:51,960
Guess we go straight?

3468
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:53,280
Yeah.

3469
02:52:59,820 --> 02:53:01,260
Oh, fuck this dog.

3470
02:53:03,440 --> 02:53:04,720
Oh my god!

3471
02:53:04,940 --> 02:53:05,460
Please!

3472
02:53:08,060 --> 02:53:08,660
Oh!

3473
02:53:08,940 --> 02:53:09,440
Shit!

3474
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:10,100
I didn't even see...

3475
02:53:10,100 --> 02:53:11,020
Okay, fuck this guy.

3476
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:13,960
I'm gonna...

3477
02:53:15,460 --> 02:53:16,620
Jesus, why are they so fast?

3478
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:19,760
Oh, follow the path next to the church?

3479
02:53:20,060 --> 02:53:21,520
There's a path next to the church?

3480
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:25,040
Hey, where is that?

3481
02:53:26,140 --> 02:53:27,460
I didn't see that.

3482
02:53:29,900 --> 02:53:30,600
Is that?

3483
02:53:34,910 --> 02:53:36,430
I don't see no path.

3484
02:53:39,490 --> 02:53:41,730
Okay, I'm gonna grab stuff again.

3485
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:50,800
The path next to the church?

3486
02:53:53,240 --> 02:53:54,180
Seek up?

3487
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:55,080
Can we up here?

3488
02:53:58,930 --> 02:53:59,890
Oh, this?

3489
02:54:04,780 --> 02:54:05,800
What's up here?

3490
02:54:09,100 --> 02:54:10,580
Oh, free items!

3491
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:11,800
He's so lonely.

3492
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:14,000
A nice smithing stone.

3493
02:54:17,770 --> 02:54:18,410
Okay.

3494
02:54:22,570 --> 02:54:24,450
Alright, we'll run past the dogs.

3495
02:54:24,450 --> 02:54:25,490
Come on, horse.

3496
02:54:27,150 --> 02:54:28,990
We're gonna do a gamer move.

3497
02:54:31,370 --> 02:54:34,030
And she waddled away, waddle, waddle.

3498
02:54:34,250 --> 02:54:37,030
And she waddled away, waddle, waddle.

3499
02:54:37,650 --> 02:54:40,010
She bravely waddled away.

3500
02:54:40,430 --> 02:54:40,850
Guys.

3501
02:54:41,270 --> 02:54:42,070
So brave.

3502
02:54:42,630 --> 02:54:43,730
Oh my god.

3503
02:54:44,070 --> 02:54:45,890
The bravest person of our generation.

3504
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:53,640
Okay, I really have to do this.

3505
02:54:58,310 --> 02:54:58,910
Weeeee.

3506
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:02,610
Alright.

3507
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:07,840
Oh, it's this.

3508
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:12,360
What is this?

3509
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:15,020
Y'all enter it.

3510
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:19,480
Where am I?

3511
02:55:25,100 --> 02:55:26,060
What the fuck?

3512
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:26,960
What the fuck?

3513
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:28,040
Who are you?

3514
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:30,020
Wait.

3515
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:31,360
You're probably the round tape.

3516
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:32,300
I thought we're friends.

3517
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:34,920
Oh my god.

3518
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:35,940
Oh my god.

3519
02:55:36,100 --> 02:55:36,680
We're not friends.

3520
02:55:41,490 --> 02:55:42,430
What is that?

3521
02:55:42,570 --> 02:55:43,410
What is that move?

3522
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:48,840
Oh my...

3523
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:49,160
Jesus.

3524
02:55:49,740 --> 02:55:50,920
What the fuck?

3525
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:52,220
He two hits me.

3526
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:03,420
Okay.

3527
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:04,320
Okay, okay.

3528
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:04,680
I...

3529
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:05,760
I understand.

3530
02:56:07,560 --> 02:56:08,380
I...

3531
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:09,920
I understand.

3532
02:56:15,720 --> 02:56:17,470
That's my code.

3533
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:20,560
Um, hello?

3534
02:56:20,780 --> 02:56:22,740
Are you guys not on Team Doki?

3535
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:23,920
Right now?

3536
02:56:28,830 --> 02:56:29,240
Okay.

3537
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:30,480
I understand.

3538
02:56:35,350 --> 02:56:35,950
Alright.

3539
02:56:36,290 --> 02:56:36,930
I understand.

3540
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:45,520
Okay.

3541
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,780
Just gotta interrupt.

3542
02:56:48,060 --> 02:56:48,300
No!

3543
02:56:48,520 --> 02:56:48,600
Fuck!

3544
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:49,320
I didn't interrupt it.

3545
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:50,200
I didn't interrupt it.

3546
02:56:52,740 --> 02:56:54,960
Someone quick appraise...

3547
02:56:55,540 --> 02:56:56,160
appraise him.

3548
02:56:57,660 --> 02:56:58,940
Oh my god.

3549
02:57:02,790 --> 02:57:03,810
Are you serious?

3550
02:57:03,890 --> 02:57:04,410
He dodges?

3551
02:57:05,770 --> 02:57:06,990
That should be cheating.

3552
02:57:14,580 --> 02:57:15,840
Oh my god.

3553
02:57:16,180 --> 02:57:17,120
Oh my god.

3554
02:57:17,240 --> 02:57:18,100
And he uses magic.

3555
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:24,180
What is that?

3556
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:25,420
What is that?

3557
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:26,440
What is he...

3558
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:27,020
Oh my god.

3559
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:28,520
He sends out like a fucking...

3560
02:57:28,520 --> 02:57:29,840
He calls out the Thor.

3561
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:34,940
Oh my god.

3562
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:35,260
No, no, no.

3563
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:35,640
I got greedy.

3564
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:36,100
I got greedy.

3565
02:57:37,820 --> 02:57:38,920
Oh my god.

3566
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:39,400
He heals.

3567
02:57:39,400 --> 02:57:39,840
I forgot.

3568
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:41,420
He's just like me.

3569
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:43,960
I forgot he's me.

3570
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:46,460
He's a regular man.

3571
02:57:46,620 --> 02:57:48,080
So he's allowed to heal.

3572
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,020
Oh my god.

3573
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:54,580
I was like...

3574
02:57:55,360 --> 02:57:57,280
I almost got you now.

3575
02:57:57,480 --> 02:57:58,840
And I forgot he's just...

3576
02:57:58,840 --> 02:58:00,200
A regular man.

3577
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:01,500
So he's allowed to heal.

3578
02:58:03,340 --> 02:58:05,280
Oh my god.

3579
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:08,680
I'm not doing okay right now.

3580
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:16,180
Okay.

3581
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:18,640
Okay.

3582
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:19,900
He's so fast!

3583
02:58:28,050 --> 02:58:29,450
Oh my god.

3584
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:30,510
Okay.

3585
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:31,130
Okay.

3586
02:58:31,230 --> 02:58:31,850
I lock in.

3587
02:58:33,890 --> 02:58:35,070
I'm gonna lock in.

3588
02:58:37,810 --> 02:58:39,710
Yeah, he anti-aired me.

3589
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:47,020
Oh my god, this guy is actually the main character?

3590
02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:48,020
Are you fucking serious?

3591
02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:50,500
You mean this game isn't even about me?

3592
02:58:51,260 --> 02:58:52,800
It's about this guy?

3593
02:58:53,880 --> 02:58:55,120
He gets everything.

3594
02:58:57,920 --> 02:58:59,900
Also, no, thank you for the super chat.

3595
02:59:00,020 --> 02:59:00,260
Thank you.

3596
02:59:00,420 --> 02:59:01,020
Thank you.

3597
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:02,520
It's not fair.

3598
02:59:02,920 --> 02:59:05,040
What do you mean this game was about him?

3599
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:08,900
Oh my god.

3600
02:59:10,040 --> 02:59:11,280
Okay, I just want...

3601
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:15,160
U-turns around?

3602
02:59:15,900 --> 02:59:17,800
What the fuck?

3603
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:19,460
That's

3604
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:26,110
a U-turn.

3605
02:59:28,650 --> 02:59:31,770
That's if he did a fucking U-turn.

3606
02:59:34,650 --> 02:59:36,290
Oh my god.

3607
02:59:38,490 --> 02:59:40,590
Okay, we'll figure this out.

3608
02:59:40,710 --> 02:59:42,210
We can figure this out, guys.

3609
02:59:42,650 --> 02:59:45,130
We can figure this out together.

3610
02:59:46,150 --> 02:59:47,810
That's cheering me on.

3611
02:59:48,810 --> 02:59:50,570
He knows I can do it.

3612
02:59:50,870 --> 02:59:51,850
Or he's hungry.

3613
02:59:52,030 --> 02:59:52,790
It's one or the other.

3614
02:59:52,970 --> 02:59:53,610
I can't tell.

3615
02:59:54,630 --> 02:59:55,170
Alright.

3616
02:59:56,050 --> 02:59:58,270
Yeah, he might be the main character.

3617
02:59:58,930 --> 03:00:00,510
But I have fans.

3618
03:00:09,090 --> 03:00:09,570
Okay.

3619
03:00:11,530 --> 03:00:12,210
That's right.

3620
03:00:12,350 --> 03:00:13,850
Cheer me on, dragoons.

3621
03:00:14,890 --> 03:00:16,070
Cheer me on.

3622
03:00:18,710 --> 03:00:19,190
Alright.

3623
03:00:19,330 --> 03:00:19,670
Here we go.

3624
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:29,240
Oh.

3625
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:30,720
We both had the same idea.

3626
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:32,380
What?

3627
03:00:33,080 --> 03:00:33,260
What?

3628
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:33,320
Okay.

3629
03:00:33,580 --> 03:00:34,700
He's like, fed?

3630
03:00:35,020 --> 03:00:36,240
No, we don't.

3631
03:00:37,420 --> 03:00:38,000
Okay.

3632
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:38,940
Okay.

3633
03:00:38,940 --> 03:00:39,000
Okay.

3634
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,520
Maybe we both did not have the same idea.

3635
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:42,420
Maybe not.

3636
03:00:42,640 --> 03:00:43,420
Maybe he's right.

3637
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:49,080
Maybe we did not have the same idea, guys.

3638
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:56,330
I don't know.

3639
03:00:56,330 --> 03:00:56,930
I thought...

3640
03:00:58,270 --> 03:01:00,570
I thought we'd be cool.

3641
03:01:00,570 --> 03:01:01,570
We'd be cool, you know?

3642
03:01:06,890 --> 03:01:07,450
Oh, God.

3643
03:01:07,470 --> 03:01:08,090
I got greedy again.

3644
03:01:08,190 --> 03:01:08,610
I got greedy.

3645
03:01:08,910 --> 03:01:09,610
Oh, my God.

3646
03:01:09,690 --> 03:01:10,650
You fucking healed.

3647
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:15,480
Okay.

3648
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:16,040
Lock in.

3649
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:16,540
I'm locking in.

3650
03:01:16,600 --> 03:01:17,080
I'm locking in.

3651
03:01:20,900 --> 03:01:21,300
Okay.

3652
03:01:21,500 --> 03:01:22,260
I'm locking in.

3653
03:01:24,980 --> 03:01:25,740
Oh, my God.

3654
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:27,180
He's backing out because he's scared.

3655
03:01:27,280 --> 03:01:27,820
Oh, fuck.

3656
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:29,300
Never mind.

3657
03:01:29,540 --> 03:01:30,360
Never mind.

3658
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:31,500
Never mind.

3659
03:01:31,640 --> 03:01:32,440
He's not scared.

3660
03:01:32,700 --> 03:01:34,860
He's clearly not scared, guys.

3661
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:36,500
Never mind.

3662
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:46,480
Silly me for thinking he was scared.

3663
03:01:48,680 --> 03:01:50,220
He's literally the main character.

3664
03:01:50,260 --> 03:01:51,580
Why would he be scared?

3665
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:03,020
No more.

3666
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:03,540
Oh, fuck.

3667
03:02:08,410 --> 03:02:09,070
Oh, shit.

3668
03:02:12,330 --> 03:02:13,050
Oh, shit.

3669
03:02:19,410 --> 03:02:19,770
Okay.

3670
03:02:22,370 --> 03:02:23,830
He has another one.

3671
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:26,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3672
03:02:34,650 --> 03:02:35,230
Oh, my God.

3673
03:02:35,330 --> 03:02:35,890
I can't be greedy.

3674
03:02:42,620 --> 03:02:44,040
Don't fucking hell, you bitch.

3675
03:02:53,780 --> 03:02:54,240
That's right.

3676
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:54,980
That's your last one.

3677
03:02:55,120 --> 03:02:55,380
Yes.

3678
03:02:57,360 --> 03:02:58,300
That's right.

3679
03:02:58,520 --> 03:02:59,260
That's right.

3680
03:02:59,280 --> 03:03:00,700
I'm the main character now.

3681
03:03:01,100 --> 03:03:03,820
I will be on the cover of that magazine.

3682
03:03:04,580 --> 03:03:05,420
That's right.

3683
03:03:05,640 --> 03:03:06,480
I'll become you.

3684
03:03:06,840 --> 03:03:07,640
I'll become you.

3685
03:03:07,740 --> 03:03:09,020
Then I'll be on the cover.

3686
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:16,260
It's my turn to be on the cover of Elden Ring.

3687
03:03:16,860 --> 03:03:17,880
That's right.

3688
03:03:21,380 --> 03:03:22,560
I'm you now.

3689
03:03:22,560 --> 03:03:22,800
I'm you now.

3690
03:03:22,920 --> 03:03:23,500
Is that him?

3691
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:24,040
I'm you now.

3692
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:24,280
Oh, wait.

3693
03:03:24,460 --> 03:03:25,360
His helmet is weaker.

3694
03:03:25,640 --> 03:03:26,080
What the fuck?

3695
03:03:26,140 --> 03:03:27,540
Why the fuck would I ever want to be him?

3696
03:03:28,040 --> 03:03:29,280
Well, his armor is weaker.

3697
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:31,660
Well, his armor is dog shit.

3698
03:03:32,100 --> 03:03:32,460
What?

3699
03:03:34,460 --> 03:03:37,580
My Oshii's on the cover now.

3700
03:03:38,460 --> 03:03:38,520
My Oshii's on the cover now.

3701
03:03:38,520 --> 03:03:41,120
Bro, your armor isn't even fucking worth it.

3702
03:03:41,340 --> 03:03:42,560
What the fuck?

3703
03:03:43,300 --> 03:03:43,600
Okay.

3704
03:03:45,460 --> 03:03:46,620
It is.

3705
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:47,100
It is.

3706
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:47,880
No, it's not.

3707
03:03:50,210 --> 03:03:53,040
But it's better because it's lighter.

3708
03:03:53,880 --> 03:03:55,240
Not the point.

3709
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:56,320
Alright.

3710
03:03:56,580 --> 03:03:57,500
Let's see.

3711
03:03:58,310 --> 03:03:59,600
Is it actually better?

3712
03:04:00,380 --> 03:04:00,920
Pierce.

3713
03:04:01,460 --> 03:04:02,040
Strike.

3714
03:04:02,420 --> 03:04:02,640
Slash.

3715
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:03,900
Aren't I Slash though?

3716
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:04,880
I'm Slash.

3717
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:07,360
I'm Slash.

3718
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:09,000
That dog disagrees.

3719
03:04:10,220 --> 03:04:11,280
Oh my god.

3720
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:12,520
Everything is worse.

3721
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:15,620
Wait.

3722
03:04:15,740 --> 03:04:16,800
Am I...

3723
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:17,200
Oh!

3724
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:19,100
It's negation.

3725
03:04:19,340 --> 03:04:19,920
I'm stupid.

3726
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:20,320
Okay.

3727
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:21,700
Okay.

3728
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:22,600
This one is...

3729
03:04:22,600 --> 03:04:24,120
I'll admit that this one...

3730
03:04:24,120 --> 03:04:24,980
I'll take your shoes.

3731
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:29,160
I'll only take your shoes.

3732
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:30,380
And that's it.

3733
03:04:35,460 --> 03:04:36,500
A robustness.

3734
03:04:36,760 --> 03:04:37,280
Immunity.

3735
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:37,620
What?

3736
03:04:37,700 --> 03:04:39,220
I'm not gonna have bust size anymore?

3737
03:04:39,560 --> 03:04:39,700
Okay.

3738
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:41,120
Alright.

3739
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:42,080
I'll take your shoes.

3740
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:43,020
And your shirt.

3741
03:04:44,100 --> 03:04:45,280
Not the shirt.

3742
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:46,120
Wait.

3743
03:04:46,120 --> 03:04:46,860
Is this light roll?

3744
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:47,800
Or a heavy roll?

3745
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:48,460
I can't tell.

3746
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:50,440
Guys.

3747
03:04:50,620 --> 03:04:51,140
Jordans.

3748
03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:55,640
That's right.

3749
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:56,820
They're my shoes now.

3750
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:00,200
Okay.

3751
03:05:00,240 --> 03:05:01,040
We gotta...

3752
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:01,360
Actually.

3753
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:04,280
Let's head back to...

3754
03:05:04,820 --> 03:05:05,100
Hmm.

3755
03:05:05,480 --> 03:05:06,540
Is there a...

3756
03:05:10,890 --> 03:05:12,250
There's no light roll, right?

3757
03:05:12,370 --> 03:05:13,510
It's just medium and heavy.

3758
03:05:13,830 --> 03:05:15,170
Is there any grace near me?

3759
03:05:19,960 --> 03:05:20,440
Yeah?

3760
03:05:20,740 --> 03:05:21,120
Okay.

3761
03:05:21,400 --> 03:05:22,820
Where is the grace that's nearby?

3762
03:05:26,220 --> 03:05:27,540
Oh, there is light roll.

3763
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:27,880
Okay.

3764
03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:34,610
Stick to the right?

3765
03:05:34,830 --> 03:05:35,010
Okay.

3766
03:05:36,910 --> 03:05:37,390
Okay.

3767
03:05:37,550 --> 03:05:38,110
Cause like...

3768
03:05:38,110 --> 03:05:39,390
I don't wanna go all the way back.

3769
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:44,180
South-West.

3770
03:05:45,220 --> 03:05:46,280
Right here?

3771
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:54,060
I assume it's like somewhere here.

3772
03:05:57,060 --> 03:05:58,920
Oh, near the camp.

3773
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:01,020
Okay.

3774
03:06:01,020 --> 03:06:01,960
The camp's here.

3775
03:06:04,950 --> 03:06:06,240
I almost said South-West.

3776
03:06:06,480 --> 03:06:06,760
I was...

3777
03:06:06,760 --> 03:06:06,920
Oh!

3778
03:06:07,180 --> 03:06:08,100
That's South-West.

3779
03:06:13,290 --> 03:06:13,930
The camp's here.

3780
03:06:13,930 --> 03:06:14,090
Oh, yeah.

3781
03:06:15,770 --> 03:06:16,690
It's near here.

3782
03:06:20,260 --> 03:06:22,340
It's on the other side of this camp.

3783
03:06:29,510 --> 03:06:30,150
The...

3784
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:30,470
Okay.

3785
03:06:30,550 --> 03:06:31,310
I'll go up top.

3786
03:06:34,890 --> 03:06:36,170
Should be fine.

3787
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:41,720
I can just run past it all.

3788
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:48,320
Is it here?

3789
03:06:51,500 --> 03:06:52,220
Guardian's Garrison?

3790
03:06:57,750 --> 03:06:58,310
Oh, my God.

3791
03:06:58,390 --> 03:06:58,890
There's a dog here.

3792
03:06:59,070 --> 03:06:59,710
Oh, my God.

3793
03:06:59,890 --> 03:07:00,490
Oh, my God.

3794
03:07:00,750 --> 03:07:01,570
Oh, my God.

3795
03:07:01,630 --> 03:07:02,170
I passed it.

3796
03:07:02,250 --> 03:07:03,070
Oh, I passed it.

3797
03:07:03,110 --> 03:07:04,310
I passed it somewhere.

3798
03:07:04,590 --> 03:07:05,990
And I don't know where.

3799
03:07:07,250 --> 03:07:07,610
And...

3800
03:07:07,610 --> 03:07:08,850
Oh, there's a lot of people around me.

3801
03:07:13,160 --> 03:07:13,520
Hello?

3802
03:07:15,800 --> 03:07:16,160
Whoa!

3803
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:17,480
Okay.

3804
03:07:18,720 --> 03:07:19,080
Goodbye.

3805
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:22,500
Oh, my God.

3806
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:23,100
It was right here.

3807
03:07:23,240 --> 03:07:24,080
It was right here.

3808
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:24,520
I love.

3809
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:27,800
Oh, my God.

3810
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:29,000
She missed.

3811
03:07:29,320 --> 03:07:30,920
Ha, you missed, idiot.

3812
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:33,100
There we go.

3813
03:07:33,880 --> 03:07:34,420
We're okay.

3814
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:40,060
Okay, skilled.

3815
03:07:44,090 --> 03:07:45,430
Gotta take this off.

3816
03:07:50,250 --> 03:07:51,570
We're almost there.

3817
03:07:51,810 --> 03:07:54,390
The flame of ruin lies just ahead.

3818
03:07:54,390 --> 03:07:56,370
I'm glad it was you.

3819
03:07:56,530 --> 03:07:57,250
I traveled.

3820
03:07:57,490 --> 03:07:58,170
Oh, look.

3821
03:07:58,250 --> 03:07:59,030
She said me.

3822
03:07:59,330 --> 03:07:59,770
Not...

3823
03:07:59,770 --> 03:08:00,590
Not anyone else.

3824
03:08:01,330 --> 03:08:02,150
Thank you.

3825
03:08:02,730 --> 03:08:03,150
Torrent.

3826
03:08:03,590 --> 03:08:05,690
Please continue to ask your aid.

3827
03:08:06,330 --> 03:08:07,350
Till the end.

3828
03:08:07,570 --> 03:08:08,410
Excuse me.

3829
03:08:08,670 --> 03:08:09,210
Um...

3830
03:08:11,230 --> 03:08:11,830
Um...

3831
03:08:11,830 --> 03:08:14,130
Horse barely did as much as I did.

3832
03:08:14,310 --> 03:08:14,950
By the way.

3833
03:08:16,250 --> 03:08:16,850
Yes.

3834
03:08:17,450 --> 03:08:18,550
Oh, my God.

3835
03:08:18,910 --> 03:08:19,390
Oh, my...

3836
03:08:19,390 --> 03:08:20,390
Without protection.

3837
03:08:20,730 --> 03:08:21,490
Oh, my God.

3838
03:08:26,950 --> 03:08:31,530
Oh, my God.

3839
03:08:32,350 --> 03:08:33,950
Oh, my God.

3840
03:08:34,350 --> 03:08:35,490
Oh, my God.

3841
03:08:35,490 --> 03:08:35,750
Without...

3842
03:08:35,750 --> 03:08:37,630
Without protection.

3843
03:08:38,270 --> 03:08:40,630
Skin on skin contact, guys.

3844
03:08:44,050 --> 03:08:44,950
All right.

3845
03:08:45,370 --> 03:08:46,090
What was it?

3846
03:08:46,190 --> 03:08:47,430
Oh, it was Arcana 20.

3847
03:08:47,750 --> 03:08:47,990
Right?

3848
03:08:48,270 --> 03:08:48,510
Okay.

3849
03:08:51,150 --> 03:08:52,190
All right.

3850
03:08:52,570 --> 03:08:53,130
Oh.

3851
03:08:58,750 --> 03:09:02,350
I got the contact that I wanted.

3852
03:09:04,250 --> 03:09:05,270
All right.

3853
03:09:05,410 --> 03:09:05,570
Nice.

3854
03:09:07,990 --> 03:09:10,010
I got everything I need.

3855
03:09:10,930 --> 03:09:13,110
I'm gonna fuck these ditties.

3856
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:17,150
We gotta figure out how to get over here.

3857
03:09:19,050 --> 03:09:20,890
How do we get over there?

3858
03:09:21,410 --> 03:09:22,030
The fuck?

3859
03:09:25,730 --> 03:09:26,810
We just go up?

3860
03:09:30,960 --> 03:09:32,400
No, the vine!

3861
03:09:40,320 --> 03:09:42,100
Follow the paths?

3862
03:09:43,900 --> 03:09:45,020
Like here?

3863
03:09:52,860 --> 03:09:54,160
Check where this goes.

3864
03:09:56,420 --> 03:09:58,000
I'm a little confused.

3865
03:09:58,980 --> 03:09:59,900
Oh, there's a bridge here.

3866
03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:00,500
Oh, nice.

3867
03:10:00,660 --> 03:10:00,980
Never mind.

3868
03:10:01,100 --> 03:10:01,960
Not confused anymore.

3869
03:10:04,260 --> 03:10:05,620
What's that castle for?

3870
03:10:18,820 --> 03:10:20,520
What was that castle for, anyway?

3871
03:10:20,680 --> 03:10:21,460
Oh, it's just loot?

3872
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:22,660
Oh, okay.

3873
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:27,560
Oh, nice.

3874
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:28,740
We finally have a map, too.

3875
03:10:40,040 --> 03:10:40,700
Hey, map!

3876
03:10:42,880 --> 03:10:44,920
Oh, look at all these dead giants.

3877
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:46,880
Oh, what happened to them?

3878
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:49,820
What happened to these guys?

3879
03:10:52,060 --> 03:10:53,280
Why didn't they just...

3880
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:56,340
Oh, did they got killed by the tree virus?

3881
03:10:57,740 --> 03:10:58,680
Is that it?

3882
03:10:59,620 --> 03:10:59,950
What?

3883
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:01,460
Yeah, like, what was it called?

3884
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:02,140
The...

3885
03:11:02,140 --> 03:11:02,820
The...

3886
03:11:02,820 --> 03:11:03,180
The...

3887
03:11:03,180 --> 03:11:04,020
The...

3888
03:11:04,020 --> 03:11:04,940
Tree virus thing?

3889
03:11:05,700 --> 03:11:06,440
Death root?

3890
03:11:19,990 --> 03:11:21,370
Are they fighting each other?

3891
03:11:22,750 --> 03:11:23,170
Are they fighting each other?

3892
03:11:23,170 --> 03:11:23,710
Wait, is this a war?

3893
03:11:25,230 --> 03:11:26,390
Birds versus...

3894
03:11:26,390 --> 03:11:27,190
Death flight.

3895
03:11:31,810 --> 03:11:33,310
Wait, do I get free solos?

3896
03:11:34,090 --> 03:11:36,050
I'm gonna watch to get free runes.

3897
03:11:37,430 --> 03:11:38,750
They're just jamming.

3898
03:11:42,050 --> 03:11:42,930
Tree virus.

3899
03:11:43,450 --> 03:11:43,530
Tree virus.

3900
03:11:43,530 --> 03:11:43,870
Oh, no.

3901
03:11:44,190 --> 03:11:44,850
They got him.

3902
03:11:47,550 --> 03:11:49,050
Holy shit, that's a...

3903
03:11:49,050 --> 03:11:49,690
Oh, my God.

3904
03:11:49,770 --> 03:11:50,110
Wait, I...

3905
03:11:50,110 --> 03:11:50,490
No, no.

3906
03:11:51,090 --> 03:11:52,510
I can't bring him over?

3907
03:11:57,640 --> 03:11:58,060
Eh.

3908
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:00,580
Invaded.

3909
03:12:01,120 --> 03:12:02,320
Oh, there he is.

3910
03:12:03,120 --> 03:12:04,260
Wait, why is he doing here?

3911
03:12:06,500 --> 03:12:07,540
Wait, who the fu...

3912
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:10,300
How did you get in here?

3913
03:12:10,500 --> 03:12:11,340
What the fu...

3914
03:12:11,340 --> 03:12:12,960
What the fu...

3915
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:13,160
What the fu...

3916
03:12:16,830 --> 03:12:18,030
Why are you in my fucking...

3917
03:12:18,850 --> 03:12:19,270
Okay.

3918
03:12:21,910 --> 03:12:22,590
Oh, my God.

3919
03:12:22,770 --> 03:12:23,090
He...

3920
03:12:23,090 --> 03:12:24,250
Oh, my God.

3921
03:12:24,530 --> 03:12:24,830
He...

3922
03:12:24,830 --> 03:12:26,090
He and I are the same.

3923
03:12:28,030 --> 03:12:29,550
He's copying my move.

3924
03:12:29,690 --> 03:12:29,890
What?

3925
03:12:30,030 --> 03:12:32,150
He can roll through my move?

3926
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:37,720
Oh, my God.

3927
03:12:37,720 --> 03:12:39,220
He's actually better than me.

3928
03:12:39,400 --> 03:12:40,160
He's so much better.

3929
03:12:40,400 --> 03:12:41,460
He's actually...

3930
03:12:41,460 --> 03:12:41,960
He's literally...

3931
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:43,940
He's like the sensei.

3932
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:49,860
He's actually the sensei right now.

3933
03:12:50,660 --> 03:12:50,920
Oh,

3934
03:12:56,140 --> 03:12:57,660
my God.

3935
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:58,660
He's such a bitch.

3936
03:13:01,700 --> 03:13:03,240
I'll take your armor, too.

3937
03:13:10,370 --> 03:13:10,890
I'll take your armor, too.

3938
03:13:10,890 --> 03:13:11,730
Are you serious?

3939
03:13:12,010 --> 03:13:12,930
All he does is roll.

3940
03:13:14,690 --> 03:13:16,030
Oh, my God.

3941
03:13:19,580 --> 03:13:20,480
Oh, my...

3942
03:13:20,480 --> 03:13:21,220
That's all he does!

3943
03:13:26,080 --> 03:13:27,860
That's all we both do!

3944
03:13:27,860 --> 03:13:27,900
No!

3945
03:13:28,520 --> 03:13:29,680
We just roll!

3946
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:32,360
Oh, wait.

3947
03:13:32,460 --> 03:13:34,400
All you do is roll, too, Doki.

3948
03:13:34,640 --> 03:13:35,120
What do you mean?

3949
03:13:37,760 --> 03:13:39,920
Does it so much better than me!

3950
03:13:49,980 --> 03:13:52,340
How is he doing to so much better than me?

3951
03:13:59,220 --> 03:14:00,920
Holy shit, that's so scary.

3952
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:06,380
Okay.

3953
03:14:07,180 --> 03:14:08,260
Oh, my God.

3954
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:14,930
Are you serious?

3955
03:14:18,900 --> 03:14:21,080
At least he doesn't drink potions.

3956
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:22,180
Thank fucking God.

3957
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:22,920
Fuck this guy.

3958
03:14:23,380 --> 03:14:23,580
Fuck.

3959
03:14:24,020 --> 03:14:25,600
You roll with fear.

3960
03:14:25,820 --> 03:14:28,120
He rolls with purpose.

3961
03:14:28,940 --> 03:14:30,320
Oh, my God.

3962
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:31,720
I'm gonna be you, too.

3963
03:14:31,980 --> 03:14:32,180
Wait.

3964
03:14:32,480 --> 03:14:33,880
Wait, he has a new katana.

3965
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:35,060
Wait, which katana's better?

3966
03:14:39,420 --> 03:14:40,620
Wait, which one's better?

3967
03:14:43,060 --> 03:14:43,960
Do I...

3968
03:14:43,960 --> 03:14:45,660
Do I get rid of this katana?

3969
03:14:45,820 --> 03:14:47,580
Or the serpent bone katana?

3970
03:14:49,660 --> 03:14:50,980
What do I get rid of?

3971
03:14:59,280 --> 03:15:00,220
Begone serpent?

3972
03:15:00,480 --> 03:15:00,700
Okay.

3973
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:02,000
Get rid of serpent.

3974
03:15:02,180 --> 03:15:02,400
Okay.

3975
03:15:03,460 --> 03:15:03,940
Alright.

3976
03:15:05,020 --> 03:15:06,300
Wait, what do I need?

3977
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:07,460
I need more arcane.

3978
03:15:07,580 --> 03:15:08,340
Oh, my God.

3979
03:15:08,580 --> 03:15:09,460
Why the fuck, guys?

3980
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:10,360
Why didn't you...

3981
03:15:14,600 --> 03:15:16,320
Why didn't you warn me?

3982
03:15:19,960 --> 03:15:22,020
Oh, put that on your left hand?

3983
03:15:22,220 --> 03:15:22,480
Okay.

3984
03:15:24,060 --> 03:15:24,980
Okay, so...

3985
03:15:24,980 --> 03:15:25,260
Oh, no.

3986
03:15:25,480 --> 03:15:26,900
Okay, put this on my right.

3987
03:15:27,100 --> 03:15:27,280
Okay.

3988
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:29,800
Put this here.

3989
03:15:30,060 --> 03:15:30,600
And then...

3990
03:15:30,600 --> 03:15:31,000
Yeah, okay.

3991
03:15:33,420 --> 03:15:34,560
We've been working.

3992
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:36,920
Why did you keep making me, dude?

3993
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:39,740
Why did you try to convince me to do faith?

3994
03:15:44,910 --> 03:15:45,350
Oh.

3995
03:15:47,430 --> 03:15:47,830
No.

3996
03:15:48,710 --> 03:15:49,450
Is that not...

3997
03:15:51,590 --> 03:15:53,890
Do I put this on this hand or this hand?

3998
03:15:54,130 --> 03:15:56,710
Do I put rivers of blood on my right hand or left hand?

3999
03:15:56,870 --> 03:15:57,070
Guys.

4000
03:15:59,230 --> 03:15:59,910
Which one?

4001
03:16:00,130 --> 03:16:02,610
We were working on it in the beginning.

4002
03:16:03,030 --> 03:16:05,350
In the river of blood, my beloved.

4003
03:16:07,290 --> 03:16:07,970
Right, okay.

4004
03:16:08,110 --> 03:16:08,790
So I did get it right.

4005
03:16:08,890 --> 03:16:10,310
Alright, let's upgrade our sword, though.

4006
03:16:11,610 --> 03:16:12,890
Let's do that real quick.

4007
03:16:13,110 --> 03:16:14,550
Oh, I can get flask, too.

4008
03:16:19,310 --> 03:16:19,710
Okay.

4009
03:16:21,470 --> 03:16:21,910
Yes.

4010
03:16:24,050 --> 03:16:25,490
Alright, now we're plus seven.

4011
03:16:27,350 --> 03:16:27,790
Alright.

4012
03:16:28,010 --> 03:16:29,930
I know there's an easier way to do this, but...

4013
03:16:29,930 --> 03:16:31,430
I'm old-fashioned right now.

4014
03:16:35,440 --> 03:16:36,520
Alright.

4015
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:37,280
Let's go.

4016
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:41,900
Let's upgrade this.

4017
03:16:43,420 --> 03:16:45,300
I could foc...

4018
03:16:45,300 --> 03:16:48,560
Actually, let's focus on getting...

4019
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:49,860
Uh...

4020
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:51,820
Let's actually...

4021
03:16:51,820 --> 03:16:54,720
Let's focus on leveling up first.

4022
03:16:56,100 --> 03:16:56,620
Actually...

4023
03:16:56,620 --> 03:16:56,880
Okay.

4024
03:16:57,360 --> 03:16:58,980
How much do I need to level up?

4025
03:17:02,140 --> 03:17:02,660
Uh...

4026
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:04,860
How much do I need?

4027
03:17:12,240 --> 03:17:12,760
Two?

4028
03:17:13,980 --> 03:17:14,500
Okay.

4029
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:16,280
What's a good place to farm?

4030
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:19,400
What do I farm?

4031
03:17:19,660 --> 03:17:20,020
That...

4032
03:17:20,020 --> 03:17:21,180
Where I won't die.

4033
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:22,440
Wait.

4034
03:17:23,280 --> 03:17:23,720
Oh, yeah.

4035
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:24,800
Let's eat the bossels.

4036
03:17:24,980 --> 03:17:25,680
Who do you want to eat?

4037
03:17:26,660 --> 03:17:27,580
Om-yum-yum.

4038
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:28,100
It's time.

4039
03:17:29,480 --> 03:17:29,940
Okay.

4040
03:17:30,040 --> 03:17:30,780
I have one extra here.

4041
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:31,240
Oh, shit.

4042
03:17:31,280 --> 03:17:31,460
Nice.

4043
03:17:31,460 --> 03:17:31,940
I have this.

4044
03:17:36,020 --> 03:17:36,480
Alright.

4045
03:17:36,620 --> 03:17:36,960
It's time.

4046
03:17:37,620 --> 03:17:38,960
We gotta eat one of them.

4047
03:17:39,560 --> 03:17:41,060
We gotta eat one of the bosses.

4048
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:43,040
It's om-yum-yum time.

4049
03:17:47,660 --> 03:17:48,120
Wait.

4050
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:49,080
How many do I get?

4051
03:17:53,490 --> 03:17:54,510
Eat the rich.

4052
03:17:56,810 --> 03:17:57,990
Do I eat the deer?

4053
03:17:58,570 --> 03:17:59,350
It's time.

4054
03:17:59,790 --> 03:18:00,430
I've always...

4055
03:18:00,430 --> 03:18:01,630
I want to eat venison today.

4056
03:18:02,290 --> 03:18:03,090
Om-yum-yum.

4057
03:18:07,310 --> 03:18:07,990
Um-yum-yum-yum.

4058
03:18:07,990 --> 03:18:08,350
It's time!

4059
03:18:11,610 --> 03:18:12,290
Wait.

4060
03:18:12,350 --> 03:18:13,510
Is this how I use remembrance?

4061
03:18:14,950 --> 03:18:16,650
Om-yum-yum-yum.

4062
03:18:18,250 --> 03:18:20,310
Do it for my blood sword.

4063
03:18:21,050 --> 03:18:21,950
Is that how you do it?

4064
03:18:22,370 --> 03:18:22,870
Yeah!

4065
03:18:24,630 --> 03:18:27,670
Om-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

4066
03:18:27,890 --> 03:18:29,430
Om-yum-yum.

4067
03:18:29,710 --> 03:18:30,710
Om-yum-yum.

4068
03:18:30,710 --> 03:18:30,910
Hahaha.

4069
03:18:33,550 --> 03:18:34,290
That's right.

4070
03:18:36,450 --> 03:18:36,930
Alright.

4071
03:18:37,370 --> 03:18:38,370
Let's get our cane in.

4072
03:18:39,590 --> 03:18:41,890
Okay, we just need 20k more.

4073
03:18:42,170 --> 03:18:43,030
I can farm that.

4074
03:18:43,690 --> 03:18:45,130
No, let's farm that, actually.

4075
03:18:47,630 --> 03:18:49,270
Uh... Let's farm that in that dungeon.

4076
03:18:49,450 --> 03:18:51,530
You know that dungeon where it takes, like, one hit?

4077
03:18:52,270 --> 03:18:57,370
It, like, gives us 800 per... Uh... No, I can farm that.

4078
03:18:57,710 --> 03:19:00,270
I can... I just do, like, 800 per...

4079
03:19:00,810 --> 03:19:02,130
Where's that dungeon again?

4080
03:19:02,390 --> 03:19:03,070
The little guys?

4081
03:19:03,570 --> 03:19:05,230
It's 800 souls per kill.

4082
03:19:06,050 --> 03:19:07,270
So I can just farm that.

4083
03:19:10,790 --> 03:19:12,970
Uh... Yeah, but then the giants?

4084
03:19:13,010 --> 03:19:14,730
I'm scared of dying to them.

4085
03:19:15,590 --> 03:19:18,730
So, like, I'd rather just farm the little, like, the little guys.

4086
03:19:19,650 --> 03:19:21,090
Where was that dungeon again?

4087
03:19:21,410 --> 03:19:22,290
Is it this one?

4088
03:19:22,530 --> 03:19:22,950
Freezing?

4089
03:19:23,110 --> 03:19:23,310
No.

4090
03:19:24,210 --> 03:19:25,410
Ancient snow ruins?

4091
03:19:25,650 --> 03:19:26,250
Which one was it?

4092
03:19:26,310 --> 03:19:27,010
Is it this one, right?

4093
03:19:30,140 --> 03:19:30,860
This one.

4094
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:33,160
No.

4095
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:34,480
That's where we have to go.

4096
03:19:34,600 --> 03:19:35,100
God damn it.

4097
03:19:35,180 --> 03:19:39,440
I'm, like... No, that's where all the giants are.

4098
03:19:39,740 --> 03:19:41,240
And I don't want to deal with those giants.

4099
03:19:46,010 --> 03:19:46,630
This one?

4100
03:19:47,070 --> 03:19:47,770
This one.

4101
03:19:48,810 --> 03:19:49,450
This one?

4102
03:19:49,590 --> 03:19:49,770
No.

4103
03:19:50,370 --> 03:19:51,090
This one?

4104
03:19:54,410 --> 03:19:54,770
No.

4105
03:19:55,150 --> 03:19:55,610
This one.

4106
03:19:59,580 --> 03:20:00,200
It's fine.

4107
03:20:00,540 --> 03:20:04,180
I mean, it's, like... I just killed, like, it's, like, I... Three of them... No.

4108
03:20:06,360 --> 03:20:06,880
No.

4109
03:20:07,440 --> 03:20:08,500
Not this one.

4110
03:20:09,340 --> 03:20:09,580
No.

4111
03:20:09,620 --> 03:20:09,620
Not this one.

4112
03:20:09,620 --> 03:20:10,120
God damn it.

4113
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:11,860
Where the fuck is that dungeon?

4114
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:18,220
Oh, there you go.

4115
03:20:19,280 --> 03:20:20,240
I found it.

4116
03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:21,660
It's the catacombs right here.

4117
03:20:22,400 --> 03:20:22,720
Yeah.

4118
03:20:23,120 --> 03:20:23,940
It's this one.

4119
03:20:24,080 --> 03:20:24,780
Oh, it's more close.

4120
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:29,720
It's 800 per tiny guy.

4121
03:20:29,960 --> 03:20:31,260
So, I can just kill the tiny men.

4122
03:20:32,980 --> 03:20:34,180
Get over here.

4123
03:20:34,960 --> 03:20:35,900
I'm hungry.

4124
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:40,140
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

4125
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:41,080
Oh, my God.

4126
03:20:42,160 --> 03:20:43,740
It took so long to kill.

4127
03:20:44,200 --> 03:20:46,520
It takes so long to kill, though.

4128
03:20:49,080 --> 03:20:53,560
I forgot that because, um, my sword is not upgraded at all.

4129
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:54,880
Holy shit.

4130
03:20:55,020 --> 03:20:56,360
Yeah, this guy's taking stones.

4131
03:20:56,980 --> 03:20:58,060
Oh, my God.

4132
03:20:58,420 --> 03:20:59,700
They're fucking me up.

4133
03:21:03,160 --> 03:21:04,980
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

4134
03:21:05,140 --> 03:21:05,420
Thank you.

4135
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:06,960
Okay, I remember now.

4136
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:08,360
Okay, I need to get my other sword in.

4137
03:21:08,760 --> 03:21:10,680
So I can farm these guys, at least.

4138
03:21:10,680 --> 03:21:14,780
Yeah, I can at least farm them easily.

4139
03:21:15,400 --> 03:21:16,540
Oh, my God.

4140
03:21:16,820 --> 03:21:17,860
I'm gonna die there.

4141
03:21:18,320 --> 03:21:19,480
I'm gonna die the babies.

4142
03:21:20,040 --> 03:21:21,060
Holy shit.

4143
03:21:21,980 --> 03:21:22,200
Okay.

4144
03:21:22,720 --> 03:21:24,280
Thank you for the super chat.

4145
03:21:25,160 --> 03:21:28,640
Oh, remember when I said all these guys would be so easy to farm?

4146
03:21:28,980 --> 03:21:29,520
I'm sure.

4147
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:32,900
Okay.

4148
03:21:33,460 --> 03:21:35,020
These guys are fucking me up, though.

4149
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:35,820
All right.

4150
03:21:35,900 --> 03:21:37,900
Let me swap swords real quick.

4151
03:21:42,480 --> 03:21:43,120
All right.

4152
03:21:43,340 --> 03:21:48,160
I got a swap sword so I can upgrade my arcade and then we can talk.

4153
03:21:48,840 --> 03:21:49,800
We can talk.

4154
03:21:49,960 --> 03:21:50,100
Okay.

4155
03:21:52,380 --> 03:21:52,840
We'll...

4156
03:21:53,360 --> 03:21:54,180
Just for now.

4157
03:21:54,340 --> 03:21:55,100
Just for now, guys.

4158
03:21:55,240 --> 03:21:55,700
Just for now.

4159
03:21:55,860 --> 03:21:58,460
So we can grab our upgrades real quick.

4160
03:21:59,000 --> 03:21:59,460
Just...

4161
03:22:03,200 --> 03:22:04,480
I could just...

4162
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:05,400
Yeah.

4163
03:22:05,400 --> 03:22:06,000
Okay.

4164
03:22:06,980 --> 03:22:07,460
Okay.

4165
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:07,860
There we go.

4166
03:22:08,040 --> 03:22:08,220
No.

4167
03:22:08,460 --> 03:22:09,380
They're a lot easier.

4168
03:22:09,900 --> 03:22:10,060
No.

4169
03:22:10,820 --> 03:22:12,160
They're a lot easier.

4170
03:22:15,820 --> 03:22:17,280
They're definitely a lot easier.

4171
03:22:19,140 --> 03:22:19,620
Okay.

4172
03:22:21,160 --> 03:22:21,940
Eh, no.

4173
03:22:22,240 --> 03:22:23,600
We can two-hand this.

4174
03:22:25,360 --> 03:22:25,900
There you go.

4175
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:29,540
All right.

4176
03:22:29,580 --> 03:22:29,880
Let's see.

4177
03:22:32,700 --> 03:22:33,820
How much do we need?

4178
03:22:34,280 --> 03:22:35,240
41k, right?

4179
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:39,700
Don't worry.

4180
03:22:39,820 --> 03:22:40,560
We'll be back.

4181
03:22:41,240 --> 03:22:41,800
We'll be back.

4182
03:22:42,540 --> 03:22:43,740
How much do we need?

4183
03:22:43,960 --> 03:22:44,400
41?

4184
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:45,400
Okay.

4185
03:22:45,600 --> 03:22:47,600
This is gonna take a bit, but it'll be worth it, guys.

4186
03:22:48,740 --> 03:22:49,700
It'll be worth it.

4187
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:51,520
Trust me.

4188
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:56,320
This is like the safest farm stuff.

4189
03:22:58,120 --> 03:22:59,520
Like, this is so safe.

4190
03:23:02,220 --> 03:23:03,740
I feel so safe in here.

4191
03:23:05,840 --> 03:23:06,320
Okay.

4192
03:23:06,900 --> 03:23:07,240
Okay.

4193
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:08,260
Give me a sec.

4194
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:12,480
I gotta say that, and then...

4195
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:14,280
It'll be so worth it, guys.

4196
03:23:14,480 --> 03:23:14,880
See, look at that.

4197
03:23:14,900 --> 03:23:16,180
We're at 28k already.

4198
03:23:16,620 --> 03:23:18,360
They're like 3k for a fight.

4199
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:21,560
Yeah, I got all...

4200
03:23:21,560 --> 03:23:22,280
Um...

4201
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:23,160
All my...

4202
03:23:23,160 --> 03:23:24,100
The golden runes.

4203
03:23:24,220 --> 03:23:25,200
I already used it all up.

4204
03:23:27,900 --> 03:23:28,520
All right.

4205
03:23:30,500 --> 03:23:31,300
Here we go.

4206
03:23:31,980 --> 03:23:32,840
Oh, shit.

4207
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:34,140
I forgot about the sword upgrades.

4208
03:23:34,420 --> 03:23:34,620
Fuck.

4209
03:23:35,720 --> 03:23:37,480
I forgot about that, too.

4210
03:23:37,920 --> 03:23:39,980
Guys, how much do we need for the sword upgrades?

4211
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:40,360
Yes.

4212
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:46,640
I forgot about the other important thing.

4213
03:23:48,460 --> 03:23:49,480
Are you serious?

4214
03:23:49,480 --> 03:23:50,000
Oh, my God.

4215
03:23:50,140 --> 03:23:50,820
Why are you guys...

4216
03:23:50,820 --> 03:23:53,340
Why are BNPing pussies right now?

4217
03:23:54,620 --> 03:23:57,920
Oh, my God.

4218
03:23:58,200 --> 03:23:58,780
It's fine.

4219
03:23:59,180 --> 03:23:59,840
It's fine.

4220
03:24:00,220 --> 03:24:01,340
You guys don't really matter.

4221
03:24:02,120 --> 03:24:03,520
Are you serious, bro?

4222
03:24:03,680 --> 03:24:04,660
Are you serious?

4223
03:24:04,780 --> 03:24:05,220
Get out of here.

4224
03:24:05,420 --> 03:24:05,900
Get...

4225
03:24:05,900 --> 03:24:06,580
Get...

4226
03:24:06,580 --> 03:24:07,300
Oh, my God.

4227
03:24:07,300 --> 03:24:08,100
Okay.

4228
03:24:08,320 --> 03:24:08,860
I was gonna say.

4229
03:24:09,100 --> 03:24:10,600
If he gets that bleed, I'm dead.

4230
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:13,880
20k for...

4231
03:24:13,880 --> 03:24:14,240
Okay.

4232
03:24:14,380 --> 03:24:15,100
That's just gonna...

4233
03:24:17,720 --> 03:24:18,760
I have to sell...

4234
03:24:18,760 --> 03:24:19,820
Yeah, I gotta sell stuff.

4235
03:24:20,060 --> 03:24:22,980
I'll sell stuff after I get the upgrade shit here.

4236
03:24:25,800 --> 03:24:26,240
Yeah.

4237
03:24:34,890 --> 03:24:35,690
Get out of here.

4238
03:24:35,930 --> 03:24:36,850
Get out of here.

4239
03:24:37,050 --> 03:24:37,090
Get out of here.

4240
03:24:37,470 --> 03:24:37,490
Get out of here.

4241
03:24:38,250 --> 03:24:38,830
Get out of here.

4242
03:24:41,730 --> 03:24:42,650
Oh, shit.

4243
03:24:42,850 --> 03:24:43,590
What the fuck?

4244
03:24:46,710 --> 03:24:47,630
Oh, my God.

4245
03:24:49,190 --> 03:24:50,130
Oh, my God.

4246
03:24:50,290 --> 03:24:50,490
Okay.

4247
03:24:56,550 --> 03:24:57,810
I got this...

4248
03:24:57,810 --> 03:24:58,490
That's...

4249
03:24:58,490 --> 03:24:59,390
I got it in my groove.

4250
03:24:59,970 --> 03:25:00,790
I got it in my groove.

4251
03:25:01,790 --> 03:25:02,310
That's...

4252
03:25:02,310 --> 03:25:03,210
What?

4253
03:25:03,470 --> 03:25:03,810
What?

4254
03:25:05,350 --> 03:25:05,870
What?

4255
03:25:06,910 --> 03:25:07,430
What?

4256
03:25:07,430 --> 03:25:07,510
What?

4257
03:25:08,870 --> 03:25:09,990
Oh, my God.

4258
03:25:10,310 --> 03:25:12,090
He's, like, wanting to be fed.

4259
03:25:12,810 --> 03:25:13,810
He wanted to be...

4260
03:25:13,810 --> 03:25:16,010
He wanted to be fed, like, an hour early.

4261
03:25:17,170 --> 03:25:17,690
Oh, my God.

4262
03:25:17,830 --> 03:25:17,930
Okay.

4263
03:25:17,970 --> 03:25:19,090
As long as I grab this.

4264
03:25:19,590 --> 03:25:19,790
Okay.

4265
03:25:19,890 --> 03:25:20,410
Things are okay.

4266
03:25:22,350 --> 03:25:24,410
He's trying to cheese the system.

4267
03:25:26,290 --> 03:25:27,670
Because it's, like, 3...

4268
03:25:27,670 --> 03:25:29,350
It's, like, 3.58.

4269
03:25:30,150 --> 03:25:32,010
So, he's trying to cheese the system.

4270
03:25:33,570 --> 03:25:35,050
He's, like, You don't feed me.

4271
03:25:35,110 --> 03:25:35,910
You don't win game.

4272
03:25:40,790 --> 03:25:41,590
No focus.

4273
03:25:42,210 --> 03:25:43,170
No feed.

4274
03:25:43,350 --> 03:25:43,990
No focus.

4275
03:25:47,050 --> 03:25:48,970
He keeps running the same scam.

4276
03:25:49,150 --> 03:25:49,930
Thinking it'll work.

4277
03:25:53,820 --> 03:25:54,380
Alright.

4278
03:25:54,680 --> 03:25:55,800
We're almost there, guys.

4279
03:25:56,700 --> 03:25:57,720
We're almost there.

4280
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:01,920
Over here.

4281
03:26:02,040 --> 03:26:03,680
I'll keep farming you over and over.

4282
03:26:03,940 --> 03:26:05,100
It's a time loop.

4283
03:26:06,900 --> 03:26:07,760
It's a loop.

4284
03:26:07,860 --> 03:26:08,960
This loop never ends.

4285
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:16,260
It ends.

4286
03:26:19,230 --> 03:26:20,060
That's fucking right.

4287
03:26:20,640 --> 03:26:21,160
Die!

4288
03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:23,360
Alright.

4289
03:26:25,790 --> 03:26:26,920
Two more times.

4290
03:26:27,400 --> 03:26:28,440
We're looping.

4291
03:26:28,560 --> 03:26:29,520
We're still looping.

4292
03:26:29,980 --> 03:26:31,360
We keep looping.

4293
03:26:37,220 --> 03:26:37,920
All right.

4294
03:26:40,400 --> 03:26:41,260
Two more.

4295
03:26:44,910 --> 03:26:45,630
Oh, wait.

4296
03:26:45,830 --> 03:26:45,990
Shit.

4297
03:26:46,170 --> 03:26:46,850
I forgot to...

4298
03:26:46,850 --> 03:26:48,130
Press it again.

4299
03:26:49,650 --> 03:26:50,210
Whoops.

4300
03:26:52,830 --> 03:26:53,630
There you go.

4301
03:26:54,350 --> 03:26:56,090
Oh, I can't even remember to spam this.

4302
03:26:57,010 --> 03:26:57,470
All right.

4303
03:26:59,790 --> 03:27:01,270
Bro, I know you're here.

4304
03:27:01,590 --> 03:27:03,110
Like, we've been through this already.

4305
03:27:03,430 --> 03:27:05,310
This is like the Aether 9th loop.

4306
03:27:07,210 --> 03:27:08,450
Give me...

4307
03:27:08,450 --> 03:27:09,890
Give me your lunch money.

4308
03:27:11,370 --> 03:27:12,170
All right.

4309
03:27:12,610 --> 03:27:13,730
One last loop.

4310
03:27:15,470 --> 03:27:17,090
One last loop.

4311
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:22,560
All right.

4312
03:27:23,600 --> 03:27:24,480
Here we go.

4313
03:27:24,700 --> 03:27:26,220
The groundhog fire.

4314
03:27:30,740 --> 03:27:31,760
All right.

4315
03:27:33,320 --> 03:27:34,480
Get out of here!

4316
03:27:37,870 --> 03:27:38,990
That's right.

4317
03:27:39,750 --> 03:27:40,870
Stay looping!

4318
03:27:42,470 --> 03:27:43,290
Okay.

4319
03:27:43,930 --> 03:27:44,150
That.

4320
03:27:44,590 --> 03:27:45,110
Dead.

4321
03:27:45,870 --> 03:27:47,670
Oh, and more stones for me.

4322
03:27:47,930 --> 03:27:48,370
Let's go.

4323
03:27:51,050 --> 03:27:51,790
All right.

4324
03:27:51,950 --> 03:27:52,130
Nice.

4325
03:27:52,590 --> 03:27:54,250
That should be enough for the level up.

4326
03:27:57,400 --> 03:27:57,900
Okay.

4327
03:27:59,820 --> 03:28:00,740
Oh, my God.

4328
03:28:00,740 --> 03:28:01,420
It was 42.

4329
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:02,420
That's fine.

4330
03:28:02,600 --> 03:28:03,240
I'll...

4331
03:28:03,240 --> 03:28:05,300
One more for the ride.

4332
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:06,960
One more...

4333
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:09,520
One more for the ride, I guess.

4334
03:28:13,240 --> 03:28:14,200
There you go.

4335
03:28:19,460 --> 03:28:20,100
Okay.

4336
03:28:20,540 --> 03:28:21,560
And then...

4337
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:23,640
Last guy here.

4338
03:28:23,940 --> 03:28:24,760
That's fine.

4339
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:26,220
I don't give you a little freebie yet.

4340
03:28:26,320 --> 03:28:27,260
Because you deserve it.

4341
03:28:28,240 --> 03:28:28,520
All right.

4342
03:28:28,720 --> 03:28:29,220
Now we...

4343
03:28:29,220 --> 03:28:30,140
We good to go.

4344
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:37,900
All right.

4345
03:28:38,180 --> 03:28:38,820
Up top.

4346
03:28:43,570 --> 03:28:44,530
It was up time.

4347
03:28:45,390 --> 03:28:45,870
Yeah!

4348
03:28:47,030 --> 03:28:47,670
All right.

4349
03:28:47,890 --> 03:28:48,450
Now...

4350
03:28:48,450 --> 03:28:49,930
Now we go home.

4351
03:28:50,970 --> 03:28:52,350
We go home.

4352
03:28:52,670 --> 03:28:54,030
And we're gonna sell...

4353
03:28:54,030 --> 03:28:54,590
Some stuff.

4354
03:28:56,170 --> 03:28:57,290
We're gonna...

4355
03:28:57,290 --> 03:28:58,550
We're gonna sell our things.

4356
03:29:01,310 --> 03:29:02,650
And sell my things to her.

4357
03:29:07,030 --> 03:29:07,690
All right.

4358
03:29:10,410 --> 03:29:10,850
Wait.

4359
03:29:11,030 --> 03:29:11,350
Purchase?

4360
03:29:11,430 --> 03:29:12,070
How do I sell?

4361
03:29:13,130 --> 03:29:13,410
Wait.

4362
03:29:13,510 --> 03:29:14,010
You don't...

4363
03:29:14,010 --> 03:29:14,430
Oh.

4364
03:29:15,710 --> 03:29:15,950
Wait.

4365
03:29:16,030 --> 03:29:16,430
He doesn't...

4366
03:29:16,430 --> 03:29:17,690
She doesn't take my things.

4367
03:29:20,130 --> 03:29:20,570
Wait.

4368
03:29:20,590 --> 03:29:21,770
Who do I talk to?

4369
03:29:21,930 --> 03:29:23,010
Who takes my items?

4370
03:29:24,070 --> 03:29:24,550
Oh.

4371
03:29:24,650 --> 03:29:25,310
The smith guy?

4372
03:29:26,870 --> 03:29:27,350
Oh.

4373
03:29:27,430 --> 03:29:28,590
I sell at the blacksmith.

4374
03:29:28,850 --> 03:29:29,030
Okay.

4375
03:29:30,070 --> 03:29:30,310
All right.

4376
03:29:30,330 --> 03:29:30,910
Take my stuff.

4377
03:29:34,690 --> 03:29:35,170
Sell.

4378
03:29:35,570 --> 03:29:35,990
Okay.

4379
03:29:36,270 --> 03:29:37,290
What do I sell, guys?

4380
03:29:38,150 --> 03:29:39,470
What do I not need?

4381
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:45,610
I have so many things that I don't know what I not need.

4382
03:29:56,620 --> 03:29:57,880
Majority of my items?

4383
03:29:58,160 --> 03:29:59,020
What are they, though?

4384
03:30:00,980 --> 03:30:02,600
I have so much meat on me.

4385
03:30:02,680 --> 03:30:03,280
Holy shit.

4386
03:30:06,950 --> 03:30:08,530
What can I sell?

4387
03:30:08,730 --> 03:30:09,450
Oh, my God.

4388
03:30:13,900 --> 03:30:15,220
Sell a remembrance?

4389
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:17,020
Why don't I just use a remembrance?

4390
03:30:25,920 --> 03:30:26,960
Where's my...

4391
03:30:26,960 --> 03:30:28,120
Yeah, my items don't really...

4392
03:30:28,120 --> 03:30:29,300
Oh, I can sell these guys.

4393
03:30:30,460 --> 03:30:30,800
Wait.

4394
03:30:30,860 --> 03:30:31,780
I'll just sell these guys.

4395
03:30:41,170 --> 03:30:42,210
What do you think I don't?

4396
03:30:43,270 --> 03:30:44,990
I'll just sell my duplicates, too.

4397
03:30:45,490 --> 03:30:45,650
All right.

4398
03:30:45,730 --> 03:30:46,050
That's it.

4399
03:30:46,170 --> 03:30:46,470
Fuck it.

4400
03:30:46,850 --> 03:30:48,050
It's time to go back to farm.

4401
03:30:48,530 --> 03:30:49,630
I can't be bothered.

4402
03:30:54,330 --> 03:30:55,210
We go back.

4403
03:30:56,030 --> 03:30:57,690
Did you miss me, little guys?

4404
03:30:57,890 --> 03:30:58,350
I'm here.

4405
03:30:59,030 --> 03:31:00,110
I'm here to...

4406
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:02,730
I'm here to beat you up again.

4407
03:31:06,050 --> 03:31:06,870
Groundhog Day.

4408
03:31:07,230 --> 03:31:08,890
It's not over yet.

4409
03:31:10,550 --> 03:31:11,190
No.

4410
03:31:11,610 --> 03:31:13,850
I'm going to hoard my remembrance.

4411
03:31:14,510 --> 03:31:15,930
Maybe I'll need it.

4412
03:31:16,010 --> 03:31:16,790
You don't know that.

4413
03:31:18,530 --> 03:31:19,550
Remember me?

4414
03:31:20,010 --> 03:31:21,610
It's Groundhog Day again.

4415
03:31:22,930 --> 03:31:24,350
It's never ended.

4416
03:31:26,170 --> 03:31:27,130
Oh, shit.

4417
03:31:27,510 --> 03:31:28,510
Oh, my God.

4418
03:31:28,730 --> 03:31:29,670
Oh, my God.

4419
03:31:30,070 --> 03:31:30,310
Oh.

4420
03:31:31,130 --> 03:31:31,510
Oh.

4421
03:31:31,730 --> 03:31:31,810
Oh.

4422
03:31:34,130 --> 03:31:35,150
That was close.

4423
03:31:35,470 --> 03:31:36,190
That was close.

4424
03:31:36,190 --> 03:31:38,490
Because they actually try to fight back.

4425
03:31:39,590 --> 03:31:40,990
They try to...

4426
03:31:40,990 --> 03:31:42,770
They try to fight back.

4427
03:31:42,810 --> 03:31:43,610
Holy shit.

4428
03:31:44,970 --> 03:31:47,110
I'm saving it for Elder Ring, too.

4429
03:31:49,630 --> 03:31:50,290
Please.

4430
03:31:50,450 --> 03:31:52,670
I'm saving it for Elder Ring, too.

4431
03:31:57,070 --> 03:32:01,050
Because what if these items are very important for...

4432
03:32:03,210 --> 03:32:03,770
Okay.

4433
03:32:04,250 --> 03:32:04,650
Bye.

4434
03:32:11,100 --> 03:32:11,660
Okay.

4435
03:32:13,960 --> 03:32:15,060
Oh, my God.

4436
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:16,280
Oh, Jesus Christ.

4437
03:32:16,500 --> 03:32:16,960
Oh, my God.

4438
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:18,140
How did they, like, get better?

4439
03:32:21,520 --> 03:32:22,600
She's right.

4440
03:32:23,140 --> 03:32:24,360
You don't know that.

4441
03:32:24,740 --> 03:32:25,600
What if...

4442
03:32:25,600 --> 03:32:26,780
What if it happens?

4443
03:32:32,170 --> 03:32:32,730
Okay.

4444
03:32:33,690 --> 03:32:33,970
Okay.

4445
03:32:33,970 --> 03:32:35,390
And what if I need...

4446
03:32:35,390 --> 03:32:37,470
What if I need it for Elden Ring 3?

4447
03:32:37,470 --> 03:32:38,830
You don't know that, guys.

4448
03:32:39,090 --> 03:32:41,230
I might need it for Elden Ring 3, guys.

4449
03:32:44,830 --> 03:32:45,690
There you go.

4450
03:32:53,070 --> 03:32:53,590
Nice.

4451
03:32:54,970 --> 03:32:55,490
Nice.

4452
03:32:56,690 --> 03:32:57,190
All right.

4453
03:32:58,150 --> 03:32:59,050
Three more times.

4454
03:33:01,010 --> 03:33:01,530
Yeah.

4455
03:33:01,670 --> 03:33:04,370
It unlocks a secret boss fight in Elden Ring 4.

4456
03:33:04,790 --> 03:33:06,670
If I keep it all...

4457
03:33:06,670 --> 03:33:08,230
I'll be able to...

4458
03:33:08,230 --> 03:33:09,830
And then we'll be laughing now.

4459
03:33:09,930 --> 03:33:10,870
Everyone will be like, Oh, no.

4460
03:33:11,010 --> 03:33:12,150
I used my bosses.

4461
03:33:12,850 --> 03:33:15,570
Because I thought I wouldn't need them.

4462
03:33:15,770 --> 03:33:20,130
And then they made it so you'll unlock the secret boss in Elden Ring 4.

4463
03:33:20,350 --> 03:33:22,210
And then I'll be the one laughing.

4464
03:33:22,690 --> 03:33:26,390
Because I hoarded it all for this special occasion.

4465
03:33:29,350 --> 03:33:31,230
You never punish the hoarders.

4466
03:33:37,210 --> 03:33:37,890
Nice.

4467
03:33:39,390 --> 03:33:40,270
All right.

4468
03:33:41,610 --> 03:33:42,570
The strats.

4469
03:33:42,890 --> 03:33:42,990
Yeah.

4470
03:33:46,970 --> 03:33:47,810
All right.

4471
03:33:48,430 --> 03:33:48,770
Let's...

4472
03:33:50,710 --> 03:33:52,250
We're almost there, guys.

4473
03:33:52,510 --> 03:33:53,490
We're almost there.

4474
03:33:53,630 --> 03:33:54,650
We're gonna make it.

4475
03:33:55,310 --> 03:33:57,010
We're gonna make it.

4476
03:33:59,910 --> 03:34:01,650
I need 20k, right?

4477
03:34:01,650 --> 03:34:02,150
All right.

4478
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:07,200
Okay.

4479
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:10,440
Wait.

4480
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:12,040
Wait.

4481
03:34:12,240 --> 03:34:12,780
His eye's glowing.

4482
03:34:13,100 --> 03:34:14,180
That means he'll give me more.

4483
03:34:15,680 --> 03:34:16,200
Right?

4484
03:34:19,960 --> 03:34:21,000
Get over here.

4485
03:34:22,520 --> 03:34:23,360
How much did he give me?

4486
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:25,980
I told you it was worth it.

4487
03:34:26,220 --> 03:34:26,620
Oh, my...

4488
03:34:26,620 --> 03:34:26,880
Okay.

4489
03:34:26,880 --> 03:34:27,500
Look at that.

4490
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:28,920
Bonus souls.

4491
03:34:29,160 --> 03:34:29,820
Look at that.

4492
03:34:30,160 --> 03:34:30,860
Look at that.

4493
03:34:30,860 --> 03:34:33,520
God rewarded me for my efforts.

4494
03:34:37,160 --> 03:34:37,800
He...

4495
03:34:37,800 --> 03:34:38,640
He...

4496
03:34:38,640 --> 03:34:40,380
Because I believed.

4497
03:34:41,120 --> 03:34:42,320
I believed.

4498
03:34:42,780 --> 03:34:44,400
And he rewarded me.

4499
03:34:47,100 --> 03:34:50,180
The gods above in Elden Ring.

4500
03:34:50,560 --> 03:34:52,220
I was like, you know what's up.

4501
03:34:53,580 --> 03:34:54,620
I did it.

4502
03:34:54,700 --> 03:34:55,500
The devs knew.

4503
03:34:55,900 --> 03:34:58,360
The devs were like, live patch it right now.

4504
03:34:58,480 --> 03:35:00,000
And give Doki all those runes.

4505
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:00,880
And she deserves it.

4506
03:35:01,520 --> 03:35:04,600
She's trying to save up for the secret DLC...

4507
03:35:04,600 --> 03:35:07,600
The secret boss that we're planning on adding...

4508
03:35:07,600 --> 03:35:08,500
Uh...

4509
03:35:08,500 --> 03:35:09,980
In Elden Ring 4.

4510
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:12,740
The devs heard me.

4511
03:35:12,880 --> 03:35:14,260
And live patched it in.

4512
03:35:19,520 --> 03:35:20,100
Okay.

4513
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:21,100
This is very off topic.

4514
03:35:21,260 --> 03:35:22,220
But this video...

4515
03:35:22,220 --> 03:35:22,860
Like, popped...

4516
03:35:22,860 --> 03:35:23,160
Like...

4517
03:35:23,160 --> 03:35:26,180
This video I watched two days ago popped up in my head.

4518
03:35:26,180 --> 03:35:27,660
And it's like...

4519
03:35:27,660 --> 03:35:27,740
And it's like...

4520
03:35:27,740 --> 03:35:28,840
Of XQC...

4521
03:35:28,840 --> 03:35:30,740
Watching Dora the Explorer.

4522
03:35:31,260 --> 03:35:32,780
And Dora was like...

4523
03:35:32,780 --> 03:35:34,440
What's our horse's favorite...

4524
03:35:34,900 --> 03:35:35,900
Favorite food?

4525
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:37,160
And XQC's like...

4526
03:35:37,160 --> 03:35:37,720
Apple!

4527
03:35:38,440 --> 03:35:39,160
Apple!

4528
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:40,640
Apple!

4529
03:35:40,880 --> 03:35:41,340
Oh my god.

4530
03:35:43,980 --> 03:35:45,580
Yeah, that showed up in my head.

4531
03:35:45,900 --> 03:35:46,780
And then...

4532
03:35:46,780 --> 03:35:48,060
And then Dora's like...

4533
03:35:48,060 --> 03:35:48,860
It's Apple!

4534
03:35:49,120 --> 03:35:49,840
And it's like...

4535
03:35:49,840 --> 03:35:51,420
I knew it.

4536
03:35:52,780 --> 03:35:53,820
He's like...

4537
03:35:53,820 --> 03:35:55,520
Congratulating himself.

4538
03:35:56,800 --> 03:35:58,860
Truly the streamer of our time.

4539
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:03,600
Dude, I feel like that'd be me though.

4540
03:36:07,830 --> 03:36:08,950
Oh shit.

4541
03:36:12,570 --> 03:36:14,150
Oh, what the fuck is that?

4542
03:36:18,680 --> 03:36:19,380
Okay.

4543
03:36:22,180 --> 03:36:22,880
Alright.

4544
03:36:23,280 --> 03:36:24,380
That should be enough.

4545
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:26,480
Sounds like...

4546
03:36:26,480 --> 03:36:27,280
Yeah, I just like...

4547
03:36:27,280 --> 03:36:29,060
That sounds like something I would do.

4548
03:36:29,640 --> 03:36:29,760
Yeah.

4549
03:36:30,240 --> 03:36:31,680
Is that the rare helmet?

4550
03:36:31,940 --> 03:36:32,680
Yeah, but that's shit.

4551
03:36:33,580 --> 03:36:35,920
That mask actually has a low drop rate.

4552
03:36:37,600 --> 03:36:38,780
Oh, like it's hard?

4553
03:36:40,060 --> 03:36:41,380
Okay, but what does it do?

4554
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:43,680
Oh!

4555
03:36:44,580 --> 03:36:46,060
Oh, 8.1 though.

4556
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:47,080
Yeah, that doubles.

4557
03:36:48,820 --> 03:36:49,700
That's double.

4558
03:36:52,380 --> 03:36:52,900
Um...

4559
03:36:52,900 --> 03:36:54,140
Okay, I should have enough now.

4560
03:36:54,400 --> 03:36:55,100
How many...

4561
03:36:56,180 --> 03:36:58,260
Okay, let's check how many I need.

4562
03:37:01,240 --> 03:37:02,960
Yeah, like it's hard to get.

4563
03:37:03,420 --> 03:37:03,940
Like...

4564
03:37:08,080 --> 03:37:09,620
Okay, I need...

4565
03:37:09,620 --> 03:37:09,880
Oh wait.

4566
03:37:10,420 --> 03:37:10,980
I have this.

4567
03:37:19,780 --> 03:37:21,400
Yeah, I have...

4568
03:37:25,910 --> 03:37:26,890
Okay, I have enough.

4569
03:37:31,370 --> 03:37:32,250
I have enough.

4570
03:37:32,250 --> 03:37:35,310
Okay, I need smithing stone 7.

4571
03:37:36,890 --> 03:37:39,230
Okay, sombra smithing stone 7.

4572
03:37:40,690 --> 03:37:41,230
Okay.

4573
03:37:47,410 --> 03:37:49,090
Can you buy that or no?

4574
03:37:56,090 --> 03:37:57,270
Oh, I can't.

4575
03:37:57,410 --> 03:37:58,290
Wait, what the fuck?

4576
03:38:00,210 --> 03:38:02,350
Why did you guys make me farm 20k?

4577
03:38:08,390 --> 03:38:09,850
I spent...

4578
03:38:09,850 --> 03:38:12,130
I spent 20k.

4579
03:38:12,470 --> 03:38:13,490
I spent 3k.

4580
03:38:13,850 --> 03:38:13,930
Yeah.

4581
03:38:14,750 --> 03:38:15,970
Spent 3k!

4582
03:38:16,610 --> 03:38:17,270
I...

4583
03:38:21,460 --> 03:38:23,200
Can you use the bathroom?

4584
03:38:23,860 --> 03:38:24,100
All right.

4585
03:39:29,720 --> 03:39:30,120
All right.

4586
03:39:30,120 --> 03:39:30,640
All right.

4587
03:39:30,640 --> 03:39:31,150
All right.

4588
03:39:31,880 --> 03:39:32,600
All right.

4589
03:39:32,740 --> 03:39:35,040
All right.

4590
03:39:35,540 --> 03:39:35,720
All right.

4591
03:39:35,720 --> 03:39:37,060
How am I supposed to find...

4592
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:40,100
Sombra smithing stone 7.

4593
03:39:43,080 --> 03:39:44,500
We're fine.

4594
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:47,120
We're fine.

4595
03:39:48,640 --> 03:39:50,140
Where's the closest one?

4596
03:39:51,240 --> 03:39:52,440
Probably on a mine?

4597
03:39:53,140 --> 03:39:53,720
Bell bearings?

4598
03:39:54,040 --> 03:39:54,900
Where do I go for that?

4599
03:39:55,500 --> 03:39:56,400
Oh my god.

4600
03:40:05,220 --> 03:40:07,180
Why can't I move my...

4601
03:40:08,220 --> 03:40:09,200
It's so weird.

4602
03:40:13,280 --> 03:40:14,340
Okay, there you go.

4603
03:40:16,280 --> 03:40:17,520
The castle in the north?

4604
03:40:23,590 --> 03:40:24,550
The castle?

4605
03:40:26,170 --> 03:40:26,730
Oh.

4606
03:40:33,550 --> 03:40:35,290
The zamar ruins.

4607
03:40:35,490 --> 03:40:36,430
The fuck is that?

4608
03:40:51,440 --> 03:40:53,040
Oh, I have a bell bearing offer?

4609
03:40:53,360 --> 03:40:54,100
Oh, I...

4610
03:40:54,100 --> 03:40:55,680
Okay, I'll give that to...

4611
03:40:56,300 --> 03:40:57,440
I don't think that...

4612
03:40:57,440 --> 03:40:59,280
That's like the item I need though.

4613
03:40:59,840 --> 03:41:00,540
Pretty sure.

4614
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:02,400
God, I got a lot...

4615
03:41:02,400 --> 03:41:03,420
Like disoriented there.

4616
03:41:10,610 --> 03:41:11,530
I'm not here.

4617
03:41:11,810 --> 03:41:12,350
Not here.

4618
03:41:15,450 --> 03:41:16,470
I do have one.

4619
03:41:16,930 --> 03:41:17,910
What does it give me though?

4620
03:41:18,910 --> 03:41:20,530
Not the thing I fucking need it.

4621
03:41:25,200 --> 03:41:26,820
I do need this though.

4622
03:41:27,280 --> 03:41:27,720
But...

4623
03:41:27,720 --> 03:41:28,760
I won't buy it yet.

4624
03:41:31,220 --> 03:41:32,780
Seven in Volcano Manor?

4625
03:41:32,920 --> 03:41:33,560
Do I have?

4626
03:41:34,580 --> 03:41:35,960
Okay, grace by a lift?

4627
03:41:36,060 --> 03:41:36,880
Where the fuck is that?

4628
03:41:36,940 --> 03:41:38,120
There's so many lifts, guys.

4629
03:41:39,060 --> 03:41:40,460
Guys, there's so many lifts.

4630
03:41:41,820 --> 03:41:45,000
You guys gotta be much more specific which lift it is.

4631
03:41:45,680 --> 03:41:46,120
Like...

4632
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:47,640
True.

4633
03:41:48,260 --> 03:41:48,880
So it's like...

4634
03:41:48,880 --> 03:41:49,980
The grace by the lift.

4635
03:41:50,060 --> 03:41:50,660
I'm like...

4636
03:41:50,660 --> 03:41:51,360
What do you...

4637
03:41:51,360 --> 03:41:52,260
There's so many.

4638
03:41:52,480 --> 03:41:55,020
There's so many lifts around me.

4639
03:41:57,480 --> 03:41:58,000
Like...

4640
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:07,080
Start...

4641
03:42:07,080 --> 03:42:08,120
Where the NPC is?

4642
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:09,080
This one?

4643
03:42:10,660 --> 03:42:11,400
Wait, no.

4644
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:12,220
This...

4645
03:42:12,220 --> 03:42:13,100
Which one is it?

4646
03:42:13,180 --> 03:42:13,680
This one?

4647
03:42:23,420 --> 03:42:24,180
This one?

4648
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:27,340
Okay, give me the name of the grace, guys.

4649
03:42:27,720 --> 03:42:29,300
Guys, the name of the grace.

4650
03:42:29,520 --> 03:42:30,440
That would be easier.

4651
03:42:30,440 --> 03:42:32,060
This one, the Xamarin ruins?

4652
03:42:37,360 --> 03:42:37,960
Okay.

4653
03:42:38,340 --> 03:42:39,280
Now we're here.

4654
03:42:40,360 --> 03:42:41,540
Where do we go?

4655
03:42:49,990 --> 03:42:51,350
Now where do we go?

4656
03:42:55,620 --> 03:42:56,220
West...

4657
03:42:56,220 --> 03:42:56,880
This way?

4658
03:43:05,360 --> 03:43:05,960
West...

4659
03:43:05,960 --> 03:43:06,840
South?

4660
03:43:16,630 --> 03:43:18,010
Oh, to the ruins.

4661
03:43:18,190 --> 03:43:18,410
Okay.

4662
03:43:24,960 --> 03:43:26,900
What does my right thing do?

4663
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:27,720
Okay, does that.

4664
03:43:27,720 --> 03:43:28,140
Okay.

4665
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:33,760
Okay, and then where is...

4666
03:43:33,760 --> 03:43:34,960
Past the ruins.

4667
03:43:35,700 --> 03:43:38,140
Okay, if it's past the ruins, I'm just gonna ride this.

4668
03:43:46,960 --> 03:43:48,880
Okay, there's a lady here.

4669
03:43:59,920 --> 03:44:01,000
To the left.

4670
03:44:01,580 --> 03:44:02,440
To the left.

4671
03:44:02,700 --> 03:44:03,340
To the left.

4672
03:44:07,870 --> 03:44:09,290
I think she sees me.

4673
03:44:16,020 --> 03:44:17,720
I think she saw me.

4674
03:44:27,620 --> 03:44:29,660
I can't see anything here.

4675
03:44:29,840 --> 03:44:30,540
It's just...

4676
03:44:31,920 --> 03:44:32,520
Oh!

4677
03:44:33,060 --> 03:44:33,780
Fucking hell!

4678
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:37,420
I'm a stupid bird.

4679
03:44:38,500 --> 03:44:40,220
Oh, it's on the right side.

4680
03:44:40,420 --> 03:44:40,680
Okay.

4681
03:44:42,280 --> 03:44:43,280
Check the trees.

4682
03:44:47,530 --> 03:44:48,770
Oh my God, I swear to God.

4683
03:44:48,850 --> 03:44:50,230
I'm gonna fucking look up a picture.

4684
03:44:50,230 --> 03:44:51,850
I'm gonna Google the picture.

4685
03:44:51,990 --> 03:44:52,630
I swear to God.

4686
03:44:57,050 --> 03:44:58,030
Okay, this way.

4687
03:45:05,740 --> 03:45:06,700
In the ruins?

4688
03:45:06,840 --> 03:45:07,860
But we already did the ruins.

4689
03:45:17,360 --> 03:45:19,360
We already went through that hole.

4690
03:45:20,000 --> 03:45:21,780
No, we went through that hole already.

4691
03:45:21,960 --> 03:45:22,620
And got the item.

4692
03:45:25,860 --> 03:45:28,020
Didn't we get the item already down there?

4693
03:45:35,270 --> 03:45:37,650
It's on a fucking tree?

4694
03:45:45,580 --> 03:45:47,240
Yeah, we went through that.

4695
03:45:47,360 --> 03:45:48,140
We went through that.

4696
03:45:48,240 --> 03:45:49,200
And got an item in there.

4697
03:45:50,680 --> 03:45:51,720
Oh my God.

4698
03:45:51,720 --> 03:45:52,940
We already got that.

4699
03:45:53,060 --> 03:45:54,080
Oh my God.

4700
03:45:54,080 --> 03:45:55,260
We got that already.

4701
03:45:56,060 --> 03:45:57,060
Alright, I'm Googling.

4702
03:45:57,360 --> 03:45:58,100
That's it.

4703
03:45:58,620 --> 03:46:00,400
You've lost your privileges, chat.

4704
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:02,060
I'm Googling.

4705
03:46:05,320 --> 03:46:06,380
I'm Googling.

4706
03:46:07,160 --> 03:46:08,740
You've lost your privileges.

4707
03:46:09,400 --> 03:46:10,920
It's Google time.

4708
03:46:12,320 --> 03:46:14,500
Probably for the best.

4709
03:46:14,860 --> 03:46:15,660
No!

4710
03:46:18,700 --> 03:46:20,560
Privilege has been revoked.

4711
03:46:21,340 --> 03:46:23,040
It's time to Google.

4712
03:46:23,920 --> 03:46:24,080
Alright.

4713
03:46:25,440 --> 03:46:26,040
Elden Ring.

4714
03:46:26,400 --> 03:46:26,980
Sombra.

4715
03:46:27,380 --> 03:46:27,560
Stone.

4716
03:46:28,520 --> 03:46:30,120
Level 7.

4717
03:46:31,480 --> 03:46:32,100
Alright.

4718
03:46:32,940 --> 03:46:35,080
Where can I find this shit?

4719
03:46:36,400 --> 03:46:37,100
Alright.

4720
03:46:37,620 --> 03:46:38,160
From here.

4721
03:46:38,300 --> 03:46:39,100
The fucking mouth.

4722
03:46:39,100 --> 03:46:39,420
Okay.

4723
03:46:40,640 --> 03:46:41,160
Okay.

4724
03:46:41,480 --> 03:46:42,340
All 7.

4725
03:46:42,600 --> 03:46:42,780
Okay.

4726
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:43,780
All Sombra.

4727
03:46:43,940 --> 03:46:44,600
Smithing Stones.

4728
03:46:46,320 --> 03:46:47,640
What's good, y'all?

4729
03:46:48,040 --> 03:46:48,580
That play.

4730
03:46:48,660 --> 03:46:48,940
Okay.

4731
03:46:49,160 --> 03:46:49,340
Okay.

4732
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:53,000
The first air is like...

4733
03:46:53,000 --> 03:46:53,580
What's...

4734
03:46:54,960 --> 03:46:56,160
What's good, y'all?

4735
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:58,120
It's your boy, Husky Mania.

4736
03:46:59,380 --> 03:46:59,900
Okay.

4737
03:47:00,340 --> 03:47:00,420
Wait.

4738
03:47:00,540 --> 03:47:02,300
Actually, you guys should listen to this intro.

4739
03:47:03,820 --> 03:47:04,800
What's good, y'all?

4740
03:47:04,900 --> 03:47:05,980
It's your boy, the Husky Mania.

4741
03:47:06,120 --> 03:47:10,120
Back in the building with another informal Elden Ring video for y'all.

4742
03:47:12,060 --> 03:47:12,460
Chat.

4743
03:47:12,660 --> 03:47:14,460
This is who I replaced you with.

4744
03:47:18,900 --> 03:47:19,920
Classic.

4745
03:47:23,540 --> 03:47:27,000
This is who I replaced you with.

4746
03:47:27,480 --> 03:47:28,220
Deserved.

4747
03:47:28,880 --> 03:47:31,180
I'm my boy, Husky.

4748
03:47:33,300 --> 03:47:34,880
How could you?

4749
03:47:35,340 --> 03:47:38,580
Okay, did we get... I don't even know we got the one in Volcano Manor.

4750
03:47:38,680 --> 03:47:39,240
Let's check.

4751
03:47:40,540 --> 03:47:41,560
Let's check.

4752
03:47:42,540 --> 03:47:45,640
It is so much cooler than us.

4753
03:47:46,400 --> 03:47:48,600
I did not say that.

4754
03:47:52,600 --> 03:47:54,900
I trusted with my life.

4755
03:47:58,260 --> 03:47:58,980
Alright.

4756
03:48:03,830 --> 03:48:04,430
Alright.

4757
03:48:04,430 --> 03:48:04,430
Okay.

4758
03:48:11,940 --> 03:48:12,540
Alright.

4759
03:48:18,660 --> 03:48:21,220
He's gonna take me through this way.

4760
03:48:24,380 --> 03:48:24,980
Alright.

4761
03:48:25,300 --> 03:48:25,600
Okay.

4762
03:48:25,760 --> 03:48:26,180
Let's see.

4763
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:27,180
Okay.

4764
03:48:27,280 --> 03:48:29,020
I need to figure out where the fuck is he going.

4765
03:48:29,180 --> 03:48:29,440
Okay.

4766
03:48:29,900 --> 03:48:35,120
So... He went... Alright.

4767
03:48:35,500 --> 03:48:37,740
He went... This way?

4768
03:48:37,740 --> 03:48:37,860
This way?

4769
03:48:40,500 --> 03:48:46,820
He went this way and then... Where the fuck is he going?

4770
03:48:48,340 --> 03:48:49,300
Oh my god.

4771
03:48:49,440 --> 03:48:49,820
Oh my god.

4772
03:48:49,880 --> 03:48:50,520
He baited me.

4773
03:48:50,780 --> 03:48:52,260
He fucking baited me.

4774
03:48:52,580 --> 03:48:54,280
And then he did this.

4775
03:48:54,580 --> 03:48:55,520
This guy did this.

4776
03:48:55,780 --> 03:48:57,100
He was like... Alright.

4777
03:48:57,300 --> 03:49:01,540
We're gonna go down there and then we're gonna go... Bitch.

4778
03:49:02,040 --> 03:49:02,440
Okay.

4779
03:49:02,900 --> 03:49:03,140
Alright.

4780
03:49:03,140 --> 03:49:03,320
Alright.

4781
03:49:09,710 --> 03:49:10,310
Okay.

4782
03:49:11,090 --> 03:49:12,490
Did I unlock the door?

4783
03:49:13,010 --> 03:49:14,790
Guys, I did not unlock the door.

4784
03:49:14,990 --> 03:49:24,380
How the fuck do I... How do you unlock this door?

4785
03:49:24,960 --> 03:49:27,360
He was like... You've been there.

4786
03:49:27,520 --> 03:49:29,760
You must have unlocked this door already.

4787
03:49:30,340 --> 03:49:32,020
Guys, we didn't unlock this door.

4788
03:49:32,260 --> 03:49:33,240
Wait a minute.

4789
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:34,280
It's unlocked.

4790
03:49:36,580 --> 03:49:38,920
Can we... Can we... Okay.

4791
03:49:39,260 --> 03:49:39,520
Okay.

4792
03:49:39,780 --> 03:49:39,820
Okay.

4793
03:49:39,820 --> 03:49:39,980
Alright.

4794
03:49:40,340 --> 03:49:42,840
So... Apparently... Is it... Through here?

4795
03:49:44,160 --> 03:49:44,840
Alright.

4796
03:49:44,980 --> 03:49:45,940
We have this door.

4797
03:49:46,480 --> 03:49:47,980
We have... Does this count?

4798
03:49:48,180 --> 03:49:49,580
We do have this door.

4799
03:49:54,630 --> 03:49:57,410
I have to go that long way?

4800
03:49:58,310 --> 03:50:02,490
Not to... Not to look up... How to unlock this door.

4801
03:50:02,890 --> 03:50:04,830
How... Wrong one.

4802
03:50:05,230 --> 03:50:06,790
Oh my god.

4803
03:50:07,690 --> 03:50:09,010
Now I have to...

4804
03:50:09,010 --> 03:50:12,350
Unlock the... How to look up a video.

4805
03:50:12,590 --> 03:50:15,490
On how to unlock... That door.

4806
03:50:20,990 --> 03:50:22,830
I have a grace there.

4807
03:50:23,050 --> 03:50:24,150
Thank fucking god.

4808
03:50:24,750 --> 03:50:25,550
Which is it?

4809
03:50:25,730 --> 03:50:25,970
Guys.

4810
03:50:26,170 --> 03:50:28,370
Which is the grace for this?

4811
03:50:29,310 --> 03:50:31,150
For the...

4812
03:50:31,150 --> 03:50:34,110
The chain continues.

4813
03:50:34,650 --> 03:50:34,730
The chain continues.

4814
03:50:34,730 --> 03:50:34,770
Yeah.

4815
03:50:37,930 --> 03:50:39,990
TP to the temple.

4816
03:50:40,310 --> 03:50:41,990
And then follow the path.

4817
03:50:43,010 --> 03:50:43,970
The temple?

4818
03:50:44,410 --> 03:50:44,730
Yes.

4819
03:50:44,890 --> 03:50:44,990
What?

4820
03:50:50,860 --> 03:50:53,940
Chat's thrown out for... She replaced you.

4821
03:50:54,720 --> 03:50:56,600
And where do we go?

4822
03:50:56,880 --> 03:50:58,160
Where's the path?

4823
03:50:58,160 --> 03:50:58,160
What?

4824
03:51:00,400 --> 03:51:00,960
Look.

4825
03:51:01,300 --> 03:51:01,320
Okay.

4826
03:51:01,460 --> 03:51:03,320
You guys have a chance to redeem yourself.

4827
03:51:03,540 --> 03:51:03,920
Right here.

4828
03:51:04,400 --> 03:51:05,840
This is your... Okay.

4829
03:51:06,120 --> 03:51:06,400
Bye.

4830
03:51:07,320 --> 03:51:07,880
Guys.

4831
03:51:08,060 --> 03:51:09,720
You have a chance to redeem yourself.

4832
03:51:09,880 --> 03:51:11,080
Take me to the door.

4833
03:51:11,280 --> 03:51:11,740
Unlock.

4834
03:51:12,020 --> 03:51:13,680
And then we'll... We'll talk.

4835
03:51:13,980 --> 03:51:15,320
And we'll talk, guys.

4836
03:51:15,320 --> 03:51:15,480
We'll talk, guys.

4837
03:51:15,900 --> 03:51:16,340
We'll talk, guys.

4838
03:51:17,600 --> 03:51:19,780
We'll talk, guys.

4839
03:51:19,800 --> 03:51:19,860
We'll talk, guys.

4840
03:51:19,860 --> 03:51:19,960
We'll talk, guys.

4841
03:51:20,340 --> 03:51:21,060
Alright.

4842
03:51:23,580 --> 03:51:25,820
And then you'll get your privileges again.

4843
03:51:26,940 --> 03:51:27,520
Okay.

4844
03:51:27,640 --> 03:51:28,480
Now where do I go?

4845
03:51:31,140 --> 03:51:32,380
It's... West?

4846
03:51:35,280 --> 03:51:36,560
Maybe makes sense.

4847
03:51:36,820 --> 03:51:41,040
I don't wanna... Maybe ask your boy, Husky.

4848
03:51:45,520 --> 03:51:46,200
Husky.

4849
03:51:46,200 --> 03:51:46,320
Yeah.

4850
03:51:46,660 --> 03:51:48,860
Ask your new best friend, Doki.

4851
03:51:49,480 --> 03:51:50,680
Ask Husky.

4852
03:51:53,740 --> 03:51:54,420
Guys.

4853
03:51:54,620 --> 03:51:56,100
It was just a joke.

4854
03:51:56,860 --> 03:51:59,980
Your boy, Husky, could never replace you.

4855
03:52:00,180 --> 03:52:01,160
I swear.

4856
03:52:02,800 --> 03:52:03,020
Yeah.

4857
03:52:03,680 --> 03:52:03,880
Yeah.

4858
03:52:04,300 --> 03:52:04,880
Ask...

4859
03:52:04,880 --> 03:52:05,400
Guys.

4860
03:52:05,600 --> 03:52:07,240
I was joking, guys.

4861
03:52:07,240 --> 03:52:10,180
I would never replace you with your boy, Husky.

4862
03:52:14,110 --> 03:52:16,370
I would never do such a thing.

4863
03:52:16,510 --> 03:52:17,530
Too late.

4864
03:52:18,570 --> 03:52:19,130
Guys.

4865
03:52:19,250 --> 03:52:21,750
It was just a hee-hee-ha-ha moment, guys.

4866
03:52:21,890 --> 03:52:22,770
We're still...

4867
03:52:22,770 --> 03:52:24,190
We're still here together.

4868
03:52:24,850 --> 03:52:25,410
Guys.

4869
03:52:25,730 --> 03:52:26,470
We're all...

4870
03:52:26,470 --> 03:52:27,710
We're all friends here.

4871
03:52:29,730 --> 03:52:31,250
I don't put...

4872
03:52:31,250 --> 03:52:31,630
Guys.

4873
03:52:31,730 --> 03:52:32,090
Come on.

4874
03:52:32,330 --> 03:52:33,010
You know.

4875
03:52:33,070 --> 03:52:34,350
You wanna tell me what to do?

4876
03:52:34,390 --> 03:52:36,750
I'm just a dumb VTuber.

4877
03:52:36,970 --> 03:52:38,830
Who is so lost.

4878
03:52:39,470 --> 03:52:39,970
Oh.

4879
03:52:40,390 --> 03:52:41,710
Where do I go?

4880
03:52:41,710 --> 03:52:44,130
I'm such a sleepy VTuber.

4881
03:52:44,370 --> 03:52:46,690
I don't know what to do.

4882
03:52:48,850 --> 03:52:50,030
Oh.

4883
03:52:50,890 --> 03:52:57,530
If only I have a backseater that can tell me where to go.

4884
03:52:58,390 --> 03:53:00,190
If only...

4885
03:53:02,750 --> 03:53:06,950
Oh, I'm so silly and stupid.

4886
03:53:06,950 --> 03:53:18,230
If only I have a backseater that knows exactly where to go.

4887
03:53:23,450 --> 03:53:25,950
I'm glad you are lost.

4888
03:53:25,950 --> 03:53:28,650
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

4889
03:53:28,750 --> 03:53:29,150
Thank you.

4890
03:53:29,330 --> 03:53:29,930
Thank you.

4891
03:53:30,170 --> 03:53:30,590
Thank you.

4892
03:53:33,410 --> 03:53:34,850
If only...

4893
03:53:35,750 --> 03:53:36,470
Indy...

4894
03:53:36,470 --> 03:53:37,330
...

4895
03:53:37,330 --> 03:53:37,690
...

4896
03:53:38,070 --> 03:53:38,490
...

4897
03:53:38,490 --> 03:53:38,810
...

4898
03:53:38,810 --> 03:53:39,170
...

4899
03:53:39,170 --> 03:53:41,190
I'm tired of this manipulation.

4900
03:53:44,290 --> 03:53:47,510
I'm so dumb.

4901
03:53:48,230 --> 03:53:50,530
I don't know where to go.

4902
03:53:50,850 --> 03:53:59,690
Oh, I'm so dumb.

4903
03:54:02,830 --> 03:54:04,410
I don't know where to go.

4904
03:54:04,410 --> 03:54:04,810
Fine!

4905
03:54:04,990 --> 03:54:07,950
I'll look up a YouTube cat for my boy Husky!

4906
03:54:08,250 --> 03:54:09,270
Alright, Husky!

4907
03:54:09,550 --> 03:54:12,310
Where do I fucking lock this sewer?

4908
03:54:17,680 --> 03:54:18,060
What?

4909
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:21,640
Where the fuck do I go?

4910
03:54:25,380 --> 03:54:26,040
What the?

4911
03:54:33,050 --> 03:54:33,930
Where is this?

4912
03:54:35,250 --> 03:54:36,110
Where is he?

4913
03:54:41,440 --> 03:54:42,200
Open?

4914
03:54:45,080 --> 03:54:45,840
What?

4915
03:54:49,340 --> 03:54:50,020
Okay.

4916
03:54:50,560 --> 03:54:51,120
Okay, wait.

4917
03:54:52,380 --> 03:54:53,000
Wait.

4918
03:54:53,700 --> 03:54:57,340
Oh my god, you guys are... you guys fucked with me.

4919
03:54:57,840 --> 03:54:59,780
You guys actually... oh my god.

4920
03:55:00,080 --> 03:55:00,920
Oh my god.

4921
03:55:01,060 --> 03:55:01,620
It was...

4922
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:02,420
Oh.

4923
03:55:02,720 --> 03:55:03,400
My.

4924
03:55:03,680 --> 03:55:03,860
God.

4925
03:55:06,800 --> 03:55:08,120
Oh my god.

4926
03:55:08,540 --> 03:55:09,820
It was out here.

4927
03:55:10,600 --> 03:55:11,960
It was...

4928
03:55:12,480 --> 03:55:14,200
It was out here.

4929
03:55:14,200 --> 03:55:17,640
It was out here all along.

4930
03:55:18,720 --> 03:55:20,120
Oh my god.

4931
03:55:21,580 --> 03:55:45,920
Oh my god.

4932
03:55:45,920 --> 03:55:46,460
Straight.

4933
03:55:47,500 --> 03:55:48,180
Straight.

4934
03:55:48,180 --> 03:55:48,280
Good.

4935
03:55:48,660 --> 03:55:49,340
What?

4936
03:55:50,740 --> 03:55:52,600
Okay, we'll figure this out.

4937
03:55:53,360 --> 03:55:54,460
We'll figure this out.

4938
03:55:54,540 --> 03:55:55,600
We gotta figure out...

4939
03:55:55,600 --> 03:55:57,300
How to...

4940
03:55:57,300 --> 03:55:57,320
How to...

4941
03:55:57,320 --> 03:55:59,620
Get started in the ass, Husky.

4942
03:56:00,540 --> 03:56:01,580
At chat!

4943
03:56:02,260 --> 03:56:02,860
How...

4944
03:56:02,860 --> 03:56:04,520
How do I get...

4945
03:56:04,520 --> 03:56:04,900
Chat.

4946
03:56:05,140 --> 03:56:06,120
Come on, chat.

4947
03:56:06,320 --> 03:56:07,020
Oh my god.

4948
03:56:07,200 --> 03:56:08,220
Chat, come on.

4949
03:56:08,440 --> 03:56:09,580
We're homies, right?

4950
03:56:09,940 --> 03:56:11,540
We're... we're homies.

4951
03:56:12,820 --> 03:56:13,420
We're...

4952
03:56:13,420 --> 03:56:14,000

4953
03:56:14,000 --> 03:56:14,280
We're like...

4954
03:56:14,920 --> 03:56:15,880
BFFs, guys.

4955
03:56:20,080 --> 03:56:21,580
Oh, they patched it?

4956
03:56:21,740 --> 03:56:23,620
Well, you should have played it when...

4957
03:56:23,620 --> 03:56:25,500
When it was so possible.

4958
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:26,440
Let's...

4959
03:56:26,440 --> 03:56:27,160
I'll figure this out.

4960
03:56:28,500 --> 03:56:29,100
Okay.

4961
03:56:29,300 --> 03:56:29,560
I'll...

4962
03:56:29,560 --> 03:56:30,820
I'll give you a shout out.

4963
03:56:31,440 --> 03:56:32,960
I'll give you a...

4964
03:56:33,260 --> 03:56:34,840
I will acknowledge you.

4965
03:56:35,520 --> 03:56:37,360
I will acknowledge you.

4966
03:56:38,080 --> 03:56:38,500
Okay.

4967
03:56:38,980 --> 03:56:40,420
Maybe it's here?

4968
03:56:41,580 --> 03:56:42,260
Here?

4969
03:56:42,260 --> 03:56:42,340

4970
03:56:42,540 --> 03:56:42,580

4971
03:56:42,660 --> 03:56:43,980
And then...

4972
03:56:43,980 --> 03:56:45,000
Oh, wait.

4973
03:56:45,420 --> 03:56:46,320
Maybe it's here.

4974
03:56:46,560 --> 03:56:47,520
And then...

4975
03:56:48,560 --> 03:56:49,240
Um...

4976
03:56:49,240 --> 03:56:49,680
No.

4977
03:56:49,820 --> 03:56:50,800
Oh, I don't know.

4978
03:56:50,960 --> 03:56:52,540
Maybe ask your boy...

4979
03:56:53,740 --> 03:56:54,420
Okay.

4980
03:56:54,420 --> 03:56:55,020
Not here.

4981
03:56:55,500 --> 03:56:55,980
Okay.

4982
03:56:56,780 --> 03:56:57,340
Okay.

4983
03:56:57,860 --> 03:56:58,900
And then...

4984
03:56:58,900 --> 03:57:00,120
I'll go this way.

4985
03:57:00,500 --> 03:57:01,420
And then...

4986
03:57:02,940 --> 03:57:04,460
And then I'll go...

4987
03:57:08,440 --> 03:57:09,800
Go this way.

4988
03:57:11,320 --> 03:57:11,660
And...

4989
03:57:12,940 --> 03:57:13,820
That's it.

4990
03:57:14,040 --> 03:57:14,320
That's right.

4991
03:57:14,400 --> 03:57:15,840

4992
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:17,760
That's right.

4993
03:57:18,340 --> 03:57:19,680

03:57:20,320 --> 03:57:22,080

4995
03:57:22,080 --> 03:57:22,620

4996
03:57:22,620 --> 03:57:23,240
Boy.

4997
03:57:23,940 --> 03:57:25,180
Husky goon boy.

4998
03:57:28,380 --> 03:57:29,520
You know what's up.

4999
03:57:33,990 --> 03:57:34,970
That's right.

5000
03:57:37,450 --> 03:57:38,910
I'll figure this out.

5001
03:57:39,990 --> 03:57:41,530
I'll figure this out.

5002
03:57:42,350 --> 03:57:42,570

5004
03:57:46,350 --> 03:57:47,470
Remember this guy?

5005
03:57:47,630 --> 03:57:49,650
When I got rare drop after one try?

5006
03:57:50,070 --> 03:57:50,350
Yeah.

03:57:50,970 --> 03:57:52,030
That's fucking right.

5008
03:57:55,470 --> 03:57:57,150
I will pay you no more.

5009
03:57:57,370 --> 03:57:59,870
I've been betrayed far too many times.

5010
03:58:00,110 --> 03:58:03,710
I will no longer fall for your womanly will.

5011
03:58:04,710 --> 03:58:05,830
I'm the Mexicans.

5012

03:58:32,040 --> 03:58:32,820
Here we go.

5026
03:58:35,160 --> 03:58:35,660
Okay.

5028
03:58:36,660 --> 03:58:37,260
Where am I?

5029
03:58:37,260 --> 03:58:38,720
I don't have enough.

5030
03:58:43,160 --> 03:58:43,800
I don't know.

5031
03:58:43,800 --> 03:58:43,820
Okay.

5032
03:58:44,680 --> 03:58:45,720
Oh, it's here.

5033
03:58:49,400 --> 03:58:50,040
Haha.

5034
03:58:50,240 --> 03:58:50,900
I knew it.

5035
03:58:51,700 --> 03:58:54,100
Help me if he betrays us.

5036
03:58:55,340 --> 03:58:56,680
I knew it.

5037
03:58:56,920 --> 03:58:57,280
Wait.

5038
03:58:59,580 --> 03:59:00,220
Wait.

5039
03:59:00,360 --> 03:59:00,760
Where am I?

5040
03:59:06,630 --> 03:59:07,810
Oh, I don't have enough.

5041
03:59:11,020 --> 03:59:11,660
Wait.

5042
03:59:13,040 --> 03:59:14,620
I don't have the keys.

5043
03:59:17,260 --> 03:59:18,020
Wait.

5044
03:59:19,740 --> 03:59:21,920
Was this actually the way?

5045
03:59:23,620 --> 03:59:24,380
Hahaha.

5046
03:59:25,140 --> 03:59:26,120

5048
03:59:28,960 --> 03:59:29,920
I don't even...

5049
03:59:29,920 --> 03:59:32,820
I don't even have the key for it.

5050
03:59:38,840 --> 03:59:40,000
Now, guys.

5051
03:59:40,420 --> 03:59:42,820
Now, Google how to get keys.

5052
03:59:43,240 --> 03:59:44,380

5053
03:59:44,380 --> 03:59:44,640

5054
03:59:44,640 --> 03:59:45,920
I can buy more keys.

5055
03:59:46,180 --> 03:59:46,660
I am...

5056
03:59:46,660 --> 03:59:47,140
I...

5057
03:59:47,140 --> 03:59:48,960
I know he has keys.

5058
03:59:49,220 --> 03:59:49,580
I...

5059
03:59:50,200 --> 03:59:51,580
I know he has...

5060
03:59:51,580 --> 03:59:53,360
Let me just...

5061
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:53,880
Hahaha.

5062
03:59:55,260 --> 03:59:57,040
I can buy a key here.

5063
03:59:57,220 --> 03:59:58,880
I know she has a key.

5064
03:59:59,140 --> 03:59:59,440
I...

5065
04:00:00,320 --> 04:00:02,200
I know she has a key.

5066
04:00:02,620 --> 04:00:03,040
Okay.

5067
04:00:03,480 --> 04:00:06,160
Now, we get a key here.

5068
04:00:07,660 --> 04:00:08,220
Wait.

5069
04:00:08,400 --> 04:00:09,040
There's no key.

5070
04:00:09,320 --> 04:00:09,940
Oh my...

5071
04:00:09,940 --> 04:00:10,420
Wait, there is.

5072
04:00:10,420 --> 04:00:11,200
I know I...

5073
04:00:11,200 --> 04:00:13,080
I knew I had an extra key.

5074
04:00:17,820 --> 04:00:20,280
There's so many Sombra 7s.

5075
04:00:20,520 --> 04:00:21,400
It's too late.

5076
04:00:21,880 --> 04:00:22,480
It's too late.

5077
04:00:22,640 --> 04:00:23,880
I'm committed to...

5078
04:00:23,880 --> 04:00:25,360
I'm committed now.

5079
04:00:25,880 --> 04:00:26,360
Wait, wait.

5080
04:00:26,360 --> 04:00:26,700
Hahaha.

5081
04:00:27,980 --> 04:00:29,000
Because at least...

5082
04:00:29,000 --> 04:00:30,980
My boy Huskies got me.

5083
04:00:31,700 --> 04:00:31,740
Hahaha.

5084
04:00:32,720 --> 04:00:34,220
Thank you for the super...

5085
04:00:34,220 --> 04:00:35,700
No, I already put one in it.

5086
04:00:36,180 --> 04:00:36,640
I...

5087
04:00:36,640 --> 04:00:39,000
That guy already has one of my keys.

5088
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:42,380
I already...

5089
04:00:42,380 --> 04:00:44,780
I remember I put one key on him.

5090
04:00:48,080 --> 04:00:48,420
Okay.

5091
04:00:50,020 --> 04:00:50,960
It's fine.

5092
04:00:51,220 --> 04:00:52,440
We've committed to this.

5093
04:00:53,320 --> 04:00:54,900
I've made my bed.

5094
04:00:56,960 --> 04:00:58,820
Didn't I not put one in?

5095
04:01:02,110 --> 04:01:03,700
Chat, don't help.

5096
04:01:03,840 --> 04:01:04,380
It's too late.

5097
04:01:04,660 --> 04:01:05,520
It's too late.

5098
04:01:06,020 --> 04:01:06,720
I'm...

5099
04:01:11,220 --> 04:01:11,920
Okay.

5100
04:01:12,440 --> 04:01:13,100
Just in case.

5101
04:01:13,560 --> 04:01:14,520
Just in case.

5102
04:01:15,160 --> 04:01:17,560
I don't trust any of you anymore.

5103
04:01:18,180 --> 04:01:18,880
I...

5104
04:01:18,880 --> 04:01:19,020
Hahaha.

5105
04:01:22,000 --> 04:01:22,260
Okay.

5106
04:01:24,620 --> 04:01:25,260
Alright.

5107
04:01:25,460 --> 04:01:26,800
We have enough money for it.

5108
04:01:28,700 --> 04:01:32,420
Your boy Husky can appraise the messages too.

5109
04:01:32,940 --> 04:01:33,420
Guys.

5110
04:01:33,820 --> 04:01:34,100
Guys.

5111
04:01:34,380 --> 04:01:34,580
Guys.

5112
04:01:34,880 --> 04:01:35,180
Come on.

5113
04:01:35,300 --> 04:01:35,620
God.

5114
04:01:35,820 --> 04:01:37,780
Your homie made one mistake.

5115
04:01:38,060 --> 04:01:38,380
Guys.

5116
04:01:38,840 --> 04:01:39,220
Your...

5117
04:01:41,620 --> 04:01:44,300
Your boy made one mistake.

5118
04:01:44,520 --> 04:01:44,800
Guys.

5119
04:01:45,140 --> 04:01:45,780
Come on.

5120
04:01:46,320 --> 04:01:46,820
Come on.

5121
04:01:46,820 --> 04:01:48,180
You gotta...

5122
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:48,800
Hang out again.

5123
04:01:49,060 --> 04:01:50,060
Just like old times.

5124
04:01:50,320 --> 04:01:51,060
Just like...

5125
04:01:51,060 --> 04:01:51,960
Your boy.

5126
04:01:52,260 --> 04:01:52,640
You know...

5127
04:01:52,640 --> 04:01:53,970
You know when they like...

5128
04:01:54,400 --> 04:01:55,780
When your boy...

5129
04:01:55,780 --> 04:01:56,820
You know like when...

5130
04:01:56,820 --> 04:01:58,220
One of your homies...

5131
04:01:58,220 --> 04:01:58,820
Um...

5132
04:01:58,820 --> 04:02:00,680
Chose a girl over the boys.

5133
04:02:00,940 --> 04:02:01,700
And then like...

5134
04:02:01,700 --> 04:02:02,280
They break up.

5135
04:02:02,380 --> 04:02:02,800
And they're like...

5136
04:02:02,800 --> 04:02:03,200
Guys.

5137
04:02:03,200 --> 04:02:04,160
I made a mistake.

5138
04:02:04,160 --> 04:02:04,540
Guys.

5139
04:02:04,680 --> 04:02:05,620
Like I was just...

5140
04:02:05,620 --> 04:02:06,460
You know...

5141
04:02:06,460 --> 04:02:06,820
I...

5142
04:02:09,820 --> 04:02:11,200
I made a mistake.

5143
04:02:11,260 --> 04:02:11,800
Guys.

5144
04:02:12,100 --> 04:02:12,560
Like we're...

5145
04:02:12,560 --> 04:02:13,240
We're over.

5146
04:02:13,240 --> 04:02:14,880
I should never have chosen...

5147
04:02:14,880 --> 04:02:15,860
Her over.

5148
04:02:16,140 --> 04:02:16,260
You.

5149
04:02:16,660 --> 04:02:17,240
Guys.

5150
04:02:17,240 --> 04:02:17,700
Look at me.

5151
04:02:17,840 --> 04:02:18,020
I'm...

5152
04:02:18,020 --> 04:02:18,520
I'm back.

5153
04:02:18,740 --> 04:02:19,480
I'm...

5154
04:02:20,840 --> 04:02:22,080
They are...

5155
04:02:22,080 --> 04:02:23,120
Dead to me.

5156
04:02:26,200 --> 04:02:28,320
We never forget.

5157
04:02:31,360 --> 04:02:32,100
Bro.

5158
04:02:33,440 --> 04:02:34,490
Your boy just...

5159
04:02:34,780 --> 04:02:36,220
Made a little oopsie.

5160
04:02:36,400 --> 04:02:37,140
And was like...

5161
04:02:37,140 --> 04:02:37,860
You know...

5162
04:02:37,860 --> 04:02:39,040
Look like...

5163
04:02:40,160 --> 04:02:41,380
It's over.

5164
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:42,660
She was nothing...

5165
04:02:42,660 --> 04:02:43,960
Between you and the boys.

5166
04:02:44,300 --> 04:02:45,440
Between us and the boys.

5167
04:02:45,700 --> 04:02:45,860
Guys.

5168
04:02:46,700 --> 04:02:47,580
Oh my god.

5169
04:02:49,460 --> 04:02:50,680
What the hell...

5170
04:02:51,120 --> 04:02:51,440
Google talking...

5171
04:02:52,040 --> 04:02:52,620
What...

5172
04:02:52,620 --> 04:02:52,940
What...

5173
04:02:52,940 --> 04:02:54,520
What do you mean...

5174
04:02:54,520 --> 04:02:55,100
Mexicon.

5175
04:02:55,460 --> 04:02:56,620
Thank you for the super chat.

5176
04:02:56,800 --> 04:02:57,060
Thank you.

5177
04:02:57,220 --> 04:02:57,560
Thank you.

5178
04:02:57,740 --> 04:02:59,140
What do you mean?

5179
04:02:59,540 --> 04:03:00,880
It was one...

5180
04:03:00,880 --> 04:03:02,240
Teensy toddy mistake.

5181
04:03:02,840 --> 04:03:04,380
But it's okay now.

5182
04:03:04,720 --> 04:03:05,040
We're...

5183
04:03:05,040 --> 04:03:06,120
We're okay now.

5184
04:03:06,320 --> 04:03:06,900
Right boys?

5185
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:10,280
Where am I?

5186
04:03:11,580 --> 04:03:12,740
Where am I?

5187
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:17,760
Oh.

5188
04:03:18,060 --> 04:03:19,060
This is an accident.

5189
04:03:21,980 --> 04:03:22,340
Wait.

5190
04:03:22,460 --> 04:03:23,200
Take me back up.

5191
04:03:26,320 --> 04:03:27,040
Not...

5192
04:03:27,040 --> 04:03:27,560
Food time!

5193
04:03:27,980 --> 04:03:29,080
He still wants food.

5194
04:03:31,140 --> 04:03:31,720
Alright.

5195
04:03:34,860 --> 04:03:35,580
Alright.

5196
04:03:38,080 --> 04:03:39,740
We go this way.

5197
04:03:40,760 --> 04:03:42,300
We go this way.

5198
04:03:43,600 --> 04:03:44,240
Okay.

5199
04:03:46,100 --> 04:03:47,620
I found the shortcut.

5200
04:03:47,820 --> 04:03:48,940
I forgot about...

5201
04:03:48,940 --> 04:03:49,060
Okay.

5202
04:03:49,220 --> 04:03:49,800
Well now...

5203
04:03:49,800 --> 04:03:50,240
Look at that.

5204
04:03:50,380 --> 04:03:50,540
See?

5205
04:03:50,700 --> 04:03:51,960
Everything is okay now.

5206
04:03:52,140 --> 04:03:53,340
Everything is okay.

5207
04:03:55,520 --> 04:03:56,200
Okay.

5208
04:03:56,540 --> 04:03:57,200
And then...

5209
04:03:57,200 --> 04:03:57,580
We go...

5210
04:03:57,960 --> 04:03:58,340
It's okay.

5211
04:03:58,460 --> 04:03:59,220
We can deal...

5212
04:03:59,220 --> 04:04:01,360
Why did you betray them?

5213
04:04:01,480 --> 04:04:02,320
He's like...

5214
04:04:02,320 --> 04:04:04,140
I'll never betray them!

5215
04:04:04,140 --> 04:04:05,560
Oh my god.

5216
04:04:05,720 --> 04:04:06,860
He got closer.

5217
04:04:07,140 --> 04:04:07,480
He...

5218
04:04:07,800 --> 04:04:09,260
He feels our pain!

5219
04:04:10,020 --> 04:04:10,600
We can't do that...

5220
04:04:11,700 --> 04:04:12,840
We can't do that.

5221
04:04:12,880 --> 04:04:13,020
We can't do that.

5222
04:04:15,360 --> 04:04:15,920
Okay.

5223
04:04:20,430 --> 04:04:20,990
Alright.

5224
04:04:21,950 --> 04:04:22,770
See guys?

5225
04:04:23,030 --> 04:04:24,170
Good thing I bought too.

5226
04:04:24,430 --> 04:04:26,310
It was my own decision for that.

5227
04:04:35,860 --> 04:04:36,420
Okay.

5228
04:04:36,420 --> 04:04:36,520
Yeah.

5229
04:04:40,510 --> 04:04:42,630
Jesus Christ, I don't like this parkour.

5230
04:04:42,750 --> 04:04:44,550
I do not like this parkour area.

5231
04:04:44,910 --> 04:04:50,950
I... I don't like this.

5232
04:05:03,250 --> 04:05:04,790
Alright, I'm gonna feed him early.

5233
04:05:08,890 --> 04:05:10,370
I'm gonna be right back.

5234
04:05:10,570 --> 04:05:11,730
I'm gonna feed him.

5235
04:05:11,910 --> 04:05:12,750
He won.

5236
04:05:13,130 --> 04:05:13,930
He won.

5237
04:06:16,290 --> 04:06:16,890
Okay.

5238
04:06:16,890 --> 04:06:17,810
I'm back.

5239
04:06:20,590 --> 04:06:23,910
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat.

5240
04:06:24,090 --> 04:06:24,350
Thank you.

5241
04:06:24,650 --> 04:06:25,210
Thank you.

5242
04:06:26,950 --> 04:06:30,810
Drag wounds, look upon this pathetic streamer.

5243
04:06:31,130 --> 04:06:33,310
Crawling back for forgiveness from us.

5244
04:06:33,550 --> 04:06:35,990
She does not earn us even status.

5245
04:06:36,630 --> 04:06:37,810
Guys, come on.

5246
04:06:37,970 --> 04:06:39,930
It's a little oopsie between bros.

5247
04:06:40,270 --> 04:06:40,710
Come on.

5248
04:06:42,750 --> 04:06:45,250
I've seen the error of my ways.

5249
04:06:45,410 --> 04:06:48,650
I... Husky meant nothing to me, guys.

5250
04:06:50,810 --> 04:06:52,810
Husky meant nothing.

5251
04:06:53,790 --> 04:06:57,110
That guy would never replace the bros.

5252
04:07:04,590 --> 04:07:11,090
I would always take my... My backseeding from my dragoons who have never led me astray.

5253
04:07:18,050 --> 04:07:19,530
All right, here I go.

5254
04:07:23,290 --> 04:07:24,850
Back at it again.

5255
04:07:27,990 --> 04:07:29,510
Fool me, what?

5256
04:07:36,980 --> 04:07:38,200
Oh, I'm... Oh my god.

5257
04:07:38,240 --> 04:07:39,160
He's gonna fuck me.

5258
04:07:39,160 --> 04:07:40,760
Oh my god.

5259
04:07:41,040 --> 04:07:41,580
Please.

5260
04:07:45,800 --> 04:07:48,420
No more false prophet.

5261
04:07:48,920 --> 04:07:50,080
Praise that.

5262
04:07:51,020 --> 04:07:52,200
Holy shit.

5263
04:07:52,820 --> 04:07:53,880
Thank you for the super chat.

5264
04:07:54,260 --> 04:07:55,500
Thank you, thank you.

5265
04:08:02,220 --> 04:08:02,820
All right.

5266
04:08:04,660 --> 04:08:07,080
I actually don't know where the elevator shortcut is.

5267
04:08:12,220 --> 04:08:13,220
Take the elevator.

5268
04:08:13,380 --> 04:08:15,280
I'm like, I don't even know where that is.

5269
04:08:15,700 --> 04:08:18,120
I'll just go the way that I've been going on.

5270
04:08:22,460 --> 04:08:24,980
Oh, left from the grace for the shortcut.

5271
04:08:25,860 --> 04:08:26,340
See?

5272
04:08:26,880 --> 04:08:28,960
I knew you guys would forgive me.

5273
04:08:33,930 --> 04:08:36,570
I knew it all can be forgiven, guys.

5274
04:08:36,950 --> 04:08:37,910
I knew it.

5275
04:08:38,790 --> 04:08:40,370
Wait, where is my grace?

5276
04:08:40,650 --> 04:08:42,030
Is it all the way down there?

5277
04:08:44,150 --> 04:08:45,970
Oh no, it's just...

5278
04:08:45,970 --> 04:08:46,450
No!

5279
04:08:46,790 --> 04:08:47,030
No!

5280
04:09:00,860 --> 04:09:01,580
Okay.

5281
04:09:01,980 --> 04:09:02,160
All right.

5282
04:09:02,280 --> 04:09:05,380
Now that I've unlocked the shortcut, things will be easier.

5283
04:09:06,080 --> 04:09:10,220
Things will be easier now that I've unlocked the shortcut.

5284
04:09:10,680 --> 04:09:12,400
I have the shortcut.

5285
04:09:12,400 --> 04:09:13,400
It's fine.

5286
04:09:13,400 --> 04:09:14,740
I have the shortcut.

5287
04:09:14,740 --> 04:09:15,820
It is fine.

5288
04:09:16,380 --> 04:09:17,060
I...

5289
04:09:20,480 --> 04:09:21,400
It's okay.

5290
04:09:26,860 --> 04:09:28,240
Mexicot, thank you for the...

5291
04:09:28,240 --> 04:09:30,060
Thank you, pandai.

5292
04:09:30,480 --> 04:09:30,940
Thank you.

5293
04:09:31,180 --> 04:09:33,240
Thank you for the super chat, Mexicot.

5294
04:09:33,780 --> 04:09:34,060
Thank you.

5295
04:09:34,200 --> 04:09:34,760
Thank you.

5296
04:09:35,500 --> 04:09:37,900
We're going to tell Mint about the inju...

5297
04:09:37,900 --> 04:09:38,600
What?

5298
04:09:39,260 --> 04:09:39,820
Injustice!

5299
04:09:40,500 --> 04:09:42,660
It was a little oopsie.

5300
04:09:45,720 --> 04:09:46,540
It's okay.

5301
04:09:46,940 --> 04:09:47,940
Everything is fine.

5302
04:09:48,900 --> 04:09:50,220
All is forgiven.

5303
04:09:54,970 --> 04:09:55,610
Okay.

5304
04:09:56,870 --> 04:09:58,110
Oh my god.

5305
04:09:58,290 --> 04:09:58,570
Oh my god.

5306
04:09:58,650 --> 04:09:59,050
He's just playing.

5307
04:09:59,350 --> 04:10:00,670
He's just doing flame on.

5308
04:10:02,090 --> 04:10:02,870
All right.

5309
04:10:03,650 --> 04:10:05,190
Just go up here.

5310
04:10:08,880 --> 04:10:11,260
Guys, I've seen the error of my ways.

5311
04:10:11,440 --> 04:10:18,800
I will never use a YouTube guide over your amazing, lovely directions and back seating.

5312
04:10:19,140 --> 04:10:22,240
You guys have never led me astray.

5313
04:10:22,580 --> 04:10:24,040
Oh my god.

5314
04:10:24,540 --> 04:10:30,840
How could I ever just use a YouTube guide when I have you guys?

5315
04:10:33,040 --> 04:10:34,480
That's right.

5316
04:10:37,580 --> 04:10:38,500
I...

5317
04:10:38,500 --> 04:10:39,420
Are you serious?

5318
04:10:39,760 --> 04:10:42,400
What the fuck is hitting me?

5319
04:10:42,640 --> 04:10:43,540
Are you...

5320
04:10:43,760 --> 04:10:45,420
Oh my god.

5321
04:10:50,530 --> 04:10:51,570
Shit, that was close.

5322
04:10:53,390 --> 04:10:55,050
Where do I go from here?

5323
04:10:59,180 --> 04:10:59,960
Excuse me?

5324
04:11:06,560 --> 04:11:07,080
Okay.

5325
04:11:08,300 --> 04:11:09,060
Oh my god.

5326
04:11:09,140 --> 04:11:09,720
Okay, lock the door.

5327
04:11:13,930 --> 04:11:17,790
It's not our fault you suck at following directions.

5328
04:11:20,150 --> 04:11:20,850
All right.

5329
04:11:25,090 --> 04:11:25,730
Is this door?

5330
04:11:25,850 --> 04:11:26,370
Oh, it's this door.

5331
04:11:27,730 --> 04:11:28,450
Oh my god.

5332
04:11:28,550 --> 04:11:29,290
I finally...

5333
04:11:29,290 --> 04:11:30,970
I finally opened the door.

5334
04:11:32,190 --> 04:11:33,790
I finally did it.

5335
04:11:39,920 --> 04:11:40,940
Get out of here.

5336
04:11:41,800 --> 04:11:43,080
You followed enough.

5337
04:11:45,860 --> 04:11:46,360
All right.

5338
04:11:46,460 --> 04:11:47,020
We just run.

5339
04:11:50,060 --> 04:11:51,480
We finally made it.

5340
04:11:54,750 --> 04:11:55,590
I want this.

5341
04:11:55,730 --> 04:11:56,550
Oh my god.

5342
04:11:58,850 --> 04:11:59,570
Oh my god.

5343
04:11:59,670 --> 04:12:00,550
There's so many of them.

5344
04:12:00,710 --> 04:12:01,550
Oh my god.

5345
04:12:01,670 --> 04:12:02,810
They're just all on the body.

5346
04:12:05,570 --> 04:12:06,670
Oh my god.

5347
04:12:06,790 --> 04:12:07,550
Get me out of here.

5348
04:12:10,110 --> 04:12:10,670
Nomming.

5349
04:12:11,930 --> 04:12:13,930
They're all just nomming at me.

5350
04:12:15,990 --> 04:12:16,790
Oh my god.

5351
04:12:17,070 --> 04:12:19,370
I forgot what the guide said after this.

5352
04:12:22,090 --> 04:12:23,210
They're just...

5353
04:12:23,210 --> 04:12:24,470
Where do I go?

5354
04:12:28,640 --> 04:12:29,900
Oh my god.

5355
04:12:30,040 --> 04:12:30,500
It's right here.

5356
04:12:30,620 --> 04:12:31,600
I didn't see that door.

5357
04:12:31,900 --> 04:12:33,320
I didn't see that door.

5358
04:12:34,880 --> 04:12:35,820
Oh my god.

5359
04:12:36,180 --> 04:12:36,220
Oh my god.

5360
04:12:36,220 --> 04:12:36,580
He's right...

5361
04:12:36,580 --> 04:12:37,400
They're right behind us.

5362
04:12:37,740 --> 04:12:38,860
They're right behind us.

5363
04:12:39,820 --> 04:12:40,960
Oh fuck!

5364
04:12:43,320 --> 04:12:44,220
I got it.

5365
04:12:45,180 --> 04:12:45,920
Sombra 7.

5366
04:12:46,060 --> 04:12:46,800
Oh shit!

5367
04:12:50,390 --> 04:12:50,990
Okay.

5368
04:12:51,550 --> 04:12:52,390
Okay, we're fine.

5369
04:12:53,870 --> 04:12:54,950
Everything is fine.

5370
04:12:57,090 --> 04:12:57,790
All right.

5371
04:12:58,010 --> 04:12:58,370
It's done.

5372
04:12:58,650 --> 04:12:59,550
It's finally done.

5373
04:12:59,890 --> 04:13:00,610
Oh my god.

5374
04:13:00,850 --> 04:13:02,810
Our fucking filler episode is over.

5375
04:13:03,190 --> 04:13:03,470
All right.

5376
04:13:03,790 --> 04:13:04,490
All right.

5377
04:13:04,850 --> 04:13:05,830
Filler episode.

5378
04:13:08,370 --> 04:13:10,710
Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

5379
04:13:10,910 --> 04:13:11,190
Thank you.

5380
04:13:11,370 --> 04:13:11,850
Thank you.

5381
04:13:12,210 --> 04:13:12,570
Turkey.

5382
04:13:12,850 --> 04:13:16,230
You're flicking me a migraine affectionately.

5383
04:13:16,370 --> 04:13:17,710
Thank you for the super chat.

5384
04:13:17,970 --> 04:13:18,210
Kevin.

5385
04:13:18,210 --> 04:13:18,830
Thank you.

5386
04:13:19,030 --> 04:13:19,550
Thank you.

5387
04:13:19,670 --> 04:13:19,810
Thank you.

5388
04:13:19,810 --> 04:13:21,070
Oh my god.

5389
04:13:21,290 --> 04:13:21,790
We did it.

5390
04:13:22,930 --> 04:13:24,450
After all that.

5391
04:13:24,730 --> 04:13:25,730
I don't have money.

5392
04:13:26,170 --> 04:13:27,290
I don't have...

5393
04:13:29,110 --> 04:13:30,250
God I...

5394
04:13:32,290 --> 04:13:33,050
Okay.

5395
04:13:33,990 --> 04:13:34,610
Okay.

5396
04:13:35,150 --> 04:13:35,810
It's fine.

5397
04:13:36,810 --> 04:13:37,510
It's...

5398
04:13:37,510 --> 04:13:38,270
It's fine.

5399
04:13:40,350 --> 04:13:41,830
No, it's fine.

5400
04:13:42,030 --> 04:13:43,370
Back at the ground...

5401
04:13:43,370 --> 04:13:44,470
It's Groundhog Day.

5402
04:13:44,870 --> 04:13:45,150
Yeah.

5403
04:13:48,930 --> 04:13:50,150
It's fine.

5404
04:13:51,030 --> 04:13:53,390
We're back for Groundhog Day.

5405
04:13:57,270 --> 04:13:58,330
It's okay.

5406
04:14:01,750 --> 04:14:02,710
All right.

5407
04:14:03,550 --> 04:14:04,950
We got this.

5408
04:14:08,070 --> 04:14:09,980
I want to try out the...

5409
04:14:11,290 --> 04:14:12,170
Let's see.

5410
04:14:14,030 --> 04:14:14,950
All right.

5411
04:14:15,570 --> 04:14:17,830
If I upgrade this even more, it's gonna be crazy.

5412
04:14:18,210 --> 04:14:18,870
Okay.

5413
04:14:19,130 --> 04:14:19,690
That's okay.

5414
04:14:20,050 --> 04:14:21,670
We'll do one more here too.

5415
04:14:23,890 --> 04:14:26,510
There's so many better ways to get runes.

5416
04:14:26,550 --> 04:14:27,490
Well, we're here now.

5417
04:14:28,790 --> 04:14:29,430
We...

5418
04:14:29,430 --> 04:14:31,770
We all suffer together here.

5419
04:14:32,490 --> 04:14:35,830
We shall do it as inefficiently as possible.

5420
04:14:38,310 --> 04:14:40,170
We all deserve this.

5421
04:14:40,450 --> 04:14:42,350
We all deserve this.

5422
04:14:52,060 --> 04:14:54,860
What is the red stuff anyway?

5423
04:14:55,400 --> 04:14:56,260
Is that like...

5424
04:14:56,260 --> 04:14:56,900
From my bleed?

5425
04:14:59,500 --> 04:15:00,720
Yeah, I know.

5426
04:15:01,860 --> 04:15:03,920
We all know what I'm doing.

5427
04:15:04,400 --> 04:15:05,000
We all...

5428
04:15:06,080 --> 04:15:09,040
We did nothing wrong.

5429
04:15:09,640 --> 04:15:11,580
This is a team effort.

5430
04:15:13,960 --> 04:15:16,260
This is a group effort, guys.

5431
04:15:21,820 --> 04:15:23,700
Well, I took you no matter.

5432
04:15:24,220 --> 04:15:25,460
Now, we can upgrade.

5433
04:15:26,860 --> 04:15:28,420
Oh, my God.

5434
04:15:28,800 --> 04:15:29,500
I...

5435
04:15:29,500 --> 04:15:29,660
I...

5436
04:15:31,340 --> 04:15:31,960
Alright.

5437
04:15:32,580 --> 04:15:33,200
This...

5438
04:15:33,200 --> 04:15:33,760
Alright.

5439
04:15:34,780 --> 04:15:35,720
We...

5440
04:15:37,500 --> 04:15:39,480
Now, where do we find...

5441
04:15:39,480 --> 04:15:40,780
Smithings...

5442
04:15:40,780 --> 04:15:42,860
Sombra's Stone 8.

5443
04:15:45,380 --> 04:15:46,260
Now!

5444
04:15:46,740 --> 04:15:47,200
Okay, guys.

5445
04:15:47,820 --> 04:15:50,560
This is the redemption arc right now.

5446
04:15:51,800 --> 04:15:53,080
Where is 8?

5447
04:15:56,060 --> 04:16:01,800
This is your chance to tell me where 8 is.

5448
04:16:04,660 --> 04:16:10,940
There was one before the Divine Carlos Tower that drops from the scarab.

5449
04:16:10,940 --> 04:16:13,280
And where is that?

5450
04:16:14,840 --> 04:16:15,680
Divine?

5451
04:16:19,020 --> 04:16:22,140
Sorry, I don't speak English.

5452
04:16:23,300 --> 04:16:25,920
Guys, where is the Divine?

5453
04:16:27,140 --> 04:16:27,980
Whatever.

5454
04:16:28,260 --> 04:16:29,840
What the fuck is that tower?

5455
04:16:32,560 --> 04:16:35,560
What's next to the sniper in the mountains?

5456
04:16:35,560 --> 04:16:36,640
Which sniper?

5457
04:16:36,960 --> 04:16:38,420
The one in the long-ass bridge?

5458
04:16:38,880 --> 04:16:39,620
This one?

5459
04:16:41,820 --> 04:16:42,760
This bridge?

5460
04:16:45,160 --> 04:16:48,720
Wait, how the fuck... This long-ass bridge right here?

5461
04:16:49,760 --> 04:16:50,960
Or this one?

5462
04:16:51,260 --> 04:16:53,020
I don't remember which bridge it was.

5463
04:16:53,640 --> 04:16:54,500
Is it Kaylin?

5464
04:17:00,840 --> 04:17:01,840
Broken Bond.

5465
04:17:01,960 --> 04:17:03,220
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

5466
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:03,580
Thank you.

5467
04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:04,140
Thank you.

5468
04:17:08,860 --> 04:17:14,700
I'm fine since a few people asked me in DMs and I got mad again.

5469
04:17:15,380 --> 04:17:20,280
I rage quit vaccinating Toki because she ran to ask you, guys.

5470
04:17:20,780 --> 04:17:21,760
You happy now?

5471
04:17:22,000 --> 04:17:24,960
I trusted her to be a reasonable person.

5472
04:17:25,100 --> 04:17:30,420
But when she decided to watch the video, it felt like a betrayal.

5473
04:17:30,420 --> 04:17:31,760
Broken Bond.

5474
04:17:32,080 --> 04:17:32,740
Broken Bond.

5475
04:17:33,120 --> 04:17:33,760
Bro.

5476
04:17:34,180 --> 04:17:34,320
Bro.

5477
04:17:34,860 --> 04:17:37,020
He don't mean like that to me, bro.

5478
04:17:37,340 --> 04:17:37,500
What?

5479
04:17:37,760 --> 04:17:42,780
You and the Dragoons and I are special Dragoons.

5480
04:17:43,120 --> 04:17:43,300
Wait.

5481
04:17:47,560 --> 04:17:48,200
Husky.

5482
04:17:48,400 --> 04:17:50,560
Husky was just a fad.

5483
04:17:51,340 --> 04:17:51,980
Just...

5484
04:17:54,220 --> 04:17:56,180
This is different.

5485
04:17:57,200 --> 04:17:58,200
Dragoons.

5486
04:18:01,320 --> 04:18:03,240
You heard him.

5487
04:18:03,720 --> 04:18:04,220
No!

5488
04:18:05,360 --> 04:18:07,940
Broken just like me.

5489
04:18:08,580 --> 04:18:11,680
Broken Bond truly is a broken...

5490
04:18:14,000 --> 04:18:15,620
Alright, Dragoons.

5491
04:18:15,780 --> 04:18:16,120
Come on.

5492
04:18:16,340 --> 04:18:17,680
Give me another chance.

5493
04:18:20,000 --> 04:18:25,500
And then he has to be like, How many more chances do we have to give you, Toki?

5494
04:18:25,740 --> 04:18:27,080
I'm running thin.

5495
04:18:27,120 --> 04:18:28,740
And then this is like a little...

5496
04:18:28,740 --> 04:18:31,160
And then we have our little soap opera.

5497
04:18:31,700 --> 04:18:32,320
Our little...

5498
04:18:34,820 --> 04:18:36,620
And the credits are rolling.

5499
04:18:36,820 --> 04:18:41,240
And then I grab your arms like, I'm like, Dragoons, please don't leave me.

5500
04:18:41,400 --> 04:18:42,960
I don't know what to do.

5501
04:18:43,660 --> 04:18:45,660
What about your backseating?

5502
04:18:45,660 --> 04:18:48,060
And then credits roll.

5503
04:18:48,340 --> 04:18:50,240
And then we won't know what happens.

5504
04:18:50,460 --> 04:18:52,040
Until the next episode.

5505
04:18:52,700 --> 04:18:53,040
Um...

5506
04:18:53,040 --> 04:18:54,660
I can't do this anymore.

5507
04:18:54,660 --> 04:18:55,860
It's too much.

5508
04:18:58,140 --> 04:18:58,860
Okay.

5509
04:18:59,040 --> 04:19:00,120
Divine Tower.

5510
04:19:00,260 --> 04:19:01,580
Where the fuck is that?

5511
04:19:02,700 --> 04:19:05,720
The fuck is the Divine Tower?

5512
04:19:07,940 --> 04:19:10,220
The church by the samurai?

5513
04:19:10,940 --> 04:19:11,620
Oh!

5514
04:19:12,080 --> 04:19:12,940
The samurai?

5515
04:19:16,620 --> 04:19:18,520
Where did I kill the samurai?

5516
04:19:18,740 --> 04:19:19,200
This guy?

5517
04:19:21,460 --> 04:19:22,060
Church.

5518
04:19:22,980 --> 04:19:23,580
Yeah?

5519
04:19:30,930 --> 04:19:32,030
The cinema.

5520
04:19:33,490 --> 04:19:33,870
Okay.

5521
04:19:37,860 --> 04:19:38,460
Alright.

5522
04:19:38,680 --> 04:19:39,180
Here we go.

5523
04:19:41,180 --> 04:19:41,780
Alright.

5524
04:19:42,000 --> 04:19:43,280
Now we gotta figure out.

5525
04:19:43,380 --> 04:19:45,080
Where to get the eighth stone.

5526
04:19:45,080 --> 04:19:45,440
Alright.

5527
04:19:49,600 --> 04:19:50,000
Okay.

5528
04:19:50,060 --> 04:19:50,900
Now where do we go?

5529
04:19:52,460 --> 04:19:53,480
Oh, Kaleid?

5530
04:19:53,620 --> 04:19:53,880
The fuck?

5531
04:19:53,980 --> 04:19:54,640
Where the fuck is it?

5532
04:19:54,680 --> 04:19:56,020
Guys, I don't know where Kaleid is.

5533
04:19:56,480 --> 04:19:57,600
I don't even know.

5534
04:19:57,960 --> 04:19:58,360
Oh.

5535
04:19:58,500 --> 04:19:58,780
Oh, wait.

5536
04:19:58,900 --> 04:19:59,540
That's Kaleid.

5537
04:19:59,700 --> 04:20:00,120
Oh, wait.

5538
04:20:00,220 --> 04:20:00,860
Here's Kaleid.

5539
04:20:01,060 --> 04:20:01,300
Wait.

5540
04:20:01,340 --> 04:20:02,660
Where do we go in Kaleid then?

5541
04:20:06,640 --> 04:20:08,140
The big red palace?

5542
04:20:08,340 --> 04:20:08,860
This palace?

5543
04:20:09,960 --> 04:20:11,160
Oh, this palace.

5544
04:20:24,250 --> 04:20:24,850
Oh.

5545
04:20:30,520 --> 04:20:32,160
North of Kaleid.

5546
04:20:33,180 --> 04:20:34,780
So that we go up?

5547
04:20:39,480 --> 04:20:40,860
Okay, but which one?

5548
04:20:41,380 --> 04:20:41,980
There's...

5549
04:20:42,680 --> 04:20:43,280
Well...

5550
04:20:43,280 --> 04:20:44,340
There's...

5551
04:20:44,340 --> 04:20:45,180
Inner...

5552
04:20:45,180 --> 04:20:45,960
Anoria.

5553
04:20:46,920 --> 04:20:47,520
There's...

5554
04:20:47,520 --> 04:20:48,600
We go this way?

5555
04:20:48,880 --> 04:20:49,380
Yeah?

5556
04:20:50,120 --> 04:20:51,880
We can grab a map here too, actually.

5557
04:20:51,980 --> 04:20:53,420
Let's go grab a map of...

5558
04:21:03,080 --> 04:21:05,060
Yeah, let's just grab a map here.

5559
04:21:08,560 --> 04:21:10,080
Let's get rid of the one.

5560
04:21:10,360 --> 04:21:11,520
Wherever that shit is.

5561
04:21:14,440 --> 04:21:14,900
Alright.

5562
04:21:18,020 --> 04:21:18,800
Oh my god.

5563
04:21:18,800 --> 04:21:20,000
It's above me, isn't it?

5564
04:21:20,580 --> 04:21:21,780
Oh my god.

5565
04:21:22,900 --> 04:21:23,360
It's...

5566
04:21:26,790 --> 04:21:28,390
Wait, I was right next to it?

5567
04:21:28,470 --> 04:21:29,150
Oh my god.

5568
04:21:29,190 --> 04:21:29,970
Okay, let's go back.

5569
04:21:36,990 --> 04:21:37,450
Okay.

5570
04:21:38,430 --> 04:21:38,910
Alright.

5571
04:21:39,830 --> 04:21:41,470
Let's figure this out.

5572
04:21:42,210 --> 04:21:44,210
There is apparently...

5573
04:21:44,210 --> 04:21:46,770
A stone here next to me.

5574
04:21:47,670 --> 04:21:49,870
One teensy-weensy stone.

5575
04:21:53,230 --> 04:21:55,270
That's right next to me.

5576
04:21:55,550 --> 04:21:55,830
East.

5577
04:21:56,450 --> 04:21:57,190
This way.

5578
04:22:01,240 --> 04:22:03,940
I am next to a teensy-weensy...

5579
04:22:03,940 --> 04:22:04,640
Oh, that guy?

5580
04:22:04,820 --> 04:22:05,360
Right here?

5581
04:22:07,140 --> 04:22:08,040
Is it that...

5582
04:22:08,040 --> 04:22:09,140
That scarab?

5583
04:22:09,320 --> 04:22:10,240
Right up above me?

5584
04:22:15,320 --> 04:22:16,080
Oh, okay.

5585
04:22:16,360 --> 04:22:17,860
How the fuck do I shoot that down?

5586
04:22:22,310 --> 04:22:22,750
Alright.

5587
04:22:23,590 --> 04:22:25,010
Let's figure out how to get up there.

5588
04:22:33,650 --> 04:22:36,230
That shit's gonna take me fucking forever to shoot that.

5589
04:22:36,310 --> 04:22:37,570
I'm just gonna climb up.

5590
04:22:37,870 --> 04:22:38,250
Oh, look!

5591
04:22:38,370 --> 04:22:38,710
Feet!

5592
04:22:45,100 --> 04:22:45,940
Holy shit!

5593
04:23:04,330 --> 04:23:05,270
Where did they...

5594
04:23:06,950 --> 04:23:09,630
Oh, I have to range fight.

5595
04:23:09,950 --> 04:23:11,650
I have to range...

5596
04:23:16,720 --> 04:23:17,520
All right.

5597
04:23:17,600 --> 04:23:18,620
I'll grab the bow.

5598
04:23:19,560 --> 04:23:21,280
Grab the bow.

5599
04:23:22,680 --> 04:23:24,420
Let me grab the bow.

5600
04:23:25,920 --> 04:23:28,300
Where is my fucking...

5601
04:23:28,300 --> 04:23:30,380
Where is my trusty bow?

5602
04:23:32,360 --> 04:23:33,740
Wait, actually, where is...

5603
04:23:33,740 --> 04:23:34,060
Okay.

5604
04:23:34,240 --> 04:23:35,540
My level one bow.

5605
04:23:35,960 --> 04:23:37,200
Where is it?

5606
04:23:37,300 --> 04:23:37,700
All right.

5607
04:23:44,190 --> 04:23:44,770
Oh, boy.

5608
04:23:55,540 --> 04:23:56,320
All right.

5609
04:23:58,120 --> 04:23:59,320
Do I not have arrows for it?

5610
04:23:59,580 --> 04:24:00,600
Are you serious?

5611
04:24:06,550 --> 04:24:07,550
Oh, my God.

5612
04:24:07,690 --> 04:24:07,910
Okay.

5613
04:24:12,720 --> 04:24:13,720
Oh, my God.

5614
04:24:13,900 --> 04:24:14,020
Okay.

5615
04:24:14,160 --> 04:24:15,360
I need to craft...

5616
04:24:15,360 --> 04:24:18,060
There's so many things I have to do.

5617
04:24:20,080 --> 04:24:20,880
There we go.

5618
04:24:21,520 --> 04:24:22,280
There we go.

5619
04:24:33,660 --> 04:24:34,180
Nice.

5620
04:24:35,940 --> 04:24:36,600
All right.

5621
04:24:36,740 --> 04:24:37,640
We did it.

5622
04:24:38,420 --> 04:24:39,700
We did it.

5623
04:24:40,960 --> 04:24:41,480
Okay.

5624
04:24:42,940 --> 04:24:43,460
Look.

5625
04:24:43,600 --> 04:24:44,320
See, guys?

5626
04:24:44,800 --> 04:24:45,320
See?

5627
04:24:45,960 --> 04:24:46,960
Look at us.

5628
04:24:47,080 --> 04:24:47,640
Look at us.

5629
04:24:47,720 --> 04:24:48,860
Look at us, guys.

5630
04:24:48,860 --> 04:24:51,780
Our chemistry is so good, guys.

5631
04:24:51,780 --> 04:24:52,700
Look at us.

5632
04:24:52,900 --> 04:24:53,800
I told...

5633
04:24:53,800 --> 04:24:55,800
I never replace you guys.

5634
04:24:56,060 --> 04:24:56,520
Come on.

5635
04:24:56,800 --> 04:24:59,160
Look at how easy that was, Dragoons.

5636
04:24:59,200 --> 04:24:59,920
Look at that.

5637
04:25:00,180 --> 04:25:01,320
That's so easy.

5638
04:25:04,380 --> 04:25:05,020
See?

5639
04:25:05,280 --> 04:25:07,160
I told you Husky meant nothing.

5640
04:25:07,160 --> 04:25:07,920
Look at that.

5641
04:25:08,440 --> 04:25:09,480
You guys...

5642
04:25:09,480 --> 04:25:11,180
Me and you, me and you, Dragoons?

5643
04:25:11,340 --> 04:25:14,060
Oh, we have something going here.

5644
04:25:14,520 --> 04:25:16,740
You're backseating in my gameplay.

5645
04:25:16,740 --> 04:25:19,740
It's something special, Dragoons.

5646
04:25:19,740 --> 04:25:26,220
He has something special, Dragoons.

5647
04:25:26,780 --> 04:25:27,500
Alright.

5648
04:25:31,300 --> 04:25:32,520
Okay, now...

5649
04:25:32,520 --> 04:25:33,320
Okay, where's nine?

5650
04:25:33,580 --> 04:25:35,740
Where the fuck is nine?

5651
04:25:38,100 --> 04:25:40,900
Alright, now we need to find nine!

5652
04:25:46,850 --> 04:25:49,770
Okay, Kaelin, for real now.

5653
04:25:50,390 --> 04:25:55,850
Now we need a fucking... Oh, we don't need to get nine yet?

5654
04:25:57,710 --> 04:25:58,790
No more?

5655
04:25:59,810 --> 04:26:01,170
Divine Tower.

5656
04:26:01,650 --> 04:26:03,870
How do we get to the Divine Tower?

5657
04:26:05,310 --> 04:26:08,030
How do I get to here, to be fair?

5658
04:26:09,650 --> 04:26:10,810
Can't do it from here?

5659
04:26:18,140 --> 04:26:18,920
Not needed?

5660
04:26:19,580 --> 04:26:20,000
Oh!

5661
04:26:21,080 --> 04:26:22,340
Okay, then we're fine.

5662
04:26:22,500 --> 04:26:22,800
Let's leave.

5663
04:26:23,660 --> 04:26:25,520
Actually, I'll go upgrade my jellyfish.

5664
04:26:27,080 --> 04:26:27,700
Hey, what?

5665
04:26:27,940 --> 04:26:28,280
Six?

5666
04:26:28,480 --> 04:26:36,340
I'll just buy the... Um, let's just buy the... I think I can buy, like, the stuff right here.

5667
04:26:37,060 --> 04:26:38,580
Oh gosh, we can get rid of the bone.

5668
04:26:39,840 --> 04:26:40,320
Here we go.

5669
04:26:42,620 --> 04:26:43,200
Alright.

5670
04:26:46,060 --> 04:26:47,200
You have enough?

5671
04:26:47,640 --> 04:26:48,460
Ah, fuck.

5672
04:26:48,780 --> 04:26:49,540
I need 4k.

5673
04:26:51,660 --> 04:26:54,220
Alright, go to Kaelin from Limgrave?

5674
04:26:54,820 --> 04:26:55,400
Limgrave?

5675
04:27:01,540 --> 04:27:03,040
I don't have Limgrave.

5676
04:27:03,160 --> 04:27:04,980
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

5677
04:27:12,150 --> 04:27:13,610
Oh, left area?

5678
04:27:14,810 --> 04:27:17,050
Oh, this Limgrave.

5679
04:27:17,290 --> 04:27:18,510
That's what you mean.

5680
04:27:20,110 --> 04:27:21,650
I thought this was Kaelin.

5681
04:27:23,930 --> 04:27:25,170
Alright, that's fine.

5682
04:27:25,390 --> 04:27:26,630
Now we can progress, guys.

5683
04:27:26,790 --> 04:27:27,130
It's okay.

5684
04:27:27,450 --> 04:27:29,530
We can finally progress now.

5685
04:27:31,610 --> 04:27:33,010
Are we supposed to go here?

5686
04:27:35,010 --> 04:27:36,290
What's here, anyway?

5687
04:27:38,170 --> 04:27:40,350
Oh, that's the Volcano Manor.

5688
04:27:41,330 --> 04:27:41,650
Alright.

5689
04:27:51,670 --> 04:27:52,270
Okay.

5690
04:27:52,870 --> 04:27:54,430
Now we gotta figure out where to go.

5691
04:27:55,730 --> 04:27:56,330
Now...

5692
04:27:56,330 --> 04:28:01,790
Alright, now... Now we can finally progress.

5693
04:28:02,550 --> 04:28:05,470
After everything we've been through.

5694
04:28:05,930 --> 04:28:08,750
We can finally move forward.

5695
04:28:11,590 --> 04:28:13,270
We did it!

5696
04:28:14,510 --> 04:28:16,030
We did it!

5697
04:28:16,030 --> 04:28:16,850
We finally did it!

5698
04:28:21,360 --> 04:28:22,460
Look at that.

5699
04:28:23,060 --> 04:28:25,620
And our relationship is fixed now.

5700
04:28:25,920 --> 04:28:27,640
Oh my god, I almost like...

5701
04:28:27,640 --> 04:28:30,380
I almost went into the depths of hell.

5702
04:28:33,340 --> 04:28:34,260
Oh yeah.

5703
04:28:34,700 --> 04:28:35,760
Oh, here it is.

5704
04:28:38,120 --> 04:28:39,640
Oh, it's like a little chain.

5705
04:28:44,360 --> 04:28:44,800
Okay.

5706
04:28:44,940 --> 04:28:44,940
Yeah.

5707
04:28:45,540 --> 04:28:45,580
Oh.

5708
04:28:45,820 --> 04:28:46,720
Oh, that's the boss.

5709
04:28:46,900 --> 04:28:48,460
Oh, I know how... I know about this boss, guys.

5710
04:28:48,920 --> 04:28:49,820
I've seen...

5711
04:28:49,820 --> 04:28:51,820
I've seen a lot of videos about this guy.

5712
04:28:52,200 --> 04:28:53,280
I know what to do.

5713
04:28:55,540 --> 04:28:56,540
Watch this.

5714
04:29:05,730 --> 04:29:06,170
Okay.

5715
04:29:06,170 --> 04:29:07,550
That's... um...

5716
04:29:25,660 --> 04:29:26,440
Okay.

5717
04:29:26,860 --> 04:29:31,580
The players in the video... make it look a lot easier.

5718
04:29:32,280 --> 04:29:36,500
They really did make that look a lot easier.

5719
04:29:36,840 --> 04:29:39,020
Than what it actually was.

5720
04:29:39,380 --> 04:29:43,460
I thought... I thought it'd be a lot easier, okay?

5721
04:29:45,800 --> 04:29:51,460
They really did make it seem incredibly easy to do.

5722
04:29:52,260 --> 04:29:57,580
They really did look very easy in the videos.

5723
04:30:01,800 --> 04:30:02,480
Um...

5724
04:30:03,220 --> 04:30:03,900
Um...

5725
04:30:05,240 --> 04:30:05,920
Um...

5726
04:30:07,860 --> 04:30:10,300
While you really showed us.

5727
04:30:13,700 --> 04:30:14,380
Alright.

5728
04:30:15,700 --> 04:30:16,380
Okay.

5729
04:30:16,580 --> 04:30:17,240
This is fine.

5730
04:30:17,520 --> 04:30:18,240
This is fine.

5731
04:30:18,980 --> 04:30:19,880
This is fine.

5732
04:30:19,960 --> 04:30:22,120
I... I know what to do now.

5733
04:30:22,460 --> 04:30:24,040
I know what to do.

5734
04:30:35,330 --> 04:30:35,890
Okay.

5735
04:30:36,210 --> 04:30:36,750
Okay.

5736
04:30:36,970 --> 04:30:39,710
This time... this time... I... I... I can do better.

5737
04:30:40,010 --> 04:30:42,190
I... I can do better this time.

5738
04:30:52,000 --> 04:30:53,660
I don't need my grace.

5739
04:30:53,880 --> 04:30:56,080
It's just too...

5740
04:30:58,530 --> 04:30:59,090
Okay.

5741
04:30:59,770 --> 04:31:00,250
See, guys?

5742
04:31:00,370 --> 04:31:01,050
I told you guys.

5743
04:31:05,050 --> 04:31:09,070
I know about the video!

5744
04:31:18,200 --> 04:31:18,960
Oh, no.

5745
04:31:24,900 --> 04:31:25,460
Okay.

5746
04:31:31,020 --> 04:31:31,560
Oh, God!

5747
04:31:31,680 --> 04:31:32,180
Oh, God!

5748
04:31:32,320 --> 04:31:32,480
Oh, God!

5749
04:31:32,740 --> 04:31:33,160
Oh,

5750
04:31:38,760 --> 04:31:38,960
God!

5751
04:31:38,960 --> 04:31:39,880
Oh, God!

5752
04:31:41,240 --> 04:31:44,400
Oh, God!

5753
04:31:45,520 --> 04:31:48,780
Oh, God!

5754
04:31:48,780 --> 04:31:49,480
Oh, God!

5755
04:31:51,980 --> 04:31:53,660
Okay, that...

5756
04:31:53,660 --> 04:31:57,340
That wasn't supposed to happen in the video to...

5757
04:31:57,340 --> 04:31:58,180
That wasn't...

5758
04:31:59,820 --> 04:32:01,200
That wasn't...

5759
04:32:01,200 --> 04:32:01,220
That wasn't...

5760
04:32:01,220 --> 04:32:04,020
The video didn't warn me about that!

5761
04:32:04,500 --> 04:32:05,780
The video...

5762
04:32:07,420 --> 04:32:10,340
This video... This video didn't warn me about that.

5763
04:32:11,960 --> 04:32:14,860
Oh, there's a Grace nearby, thank god.

5764
04:32:18,280 --> 04:32:21,580
Forget the video, don't key lock it.

5765
04:32:23,080 --> 04:32:24,580
It's okay, I got this.

5766
04:32:25,060 --> 04:32:26,760
I know what to do now.

5767
04:32:27,920 --> 04:32:29,400
For real, this time.

5768
04:32:29,940 --> 04:32:31,140
Wait, where is the other Grace?

5769
04:32:34,360 --> 04:32:36,360
I said there's a Grace nearby.

5770
04:32:37,500 --> 04:32:38,780
Is it that one?

5771
04:32:39,700 --> 04:32:42,020
Is it actually nearby though?

5772
04:32:45,850 --> 04:32:46,830
Yeah, yeah.

5773
04:32:48,770 --> 04:32:50,010
Yeah, it is.

5774
04:32:50,930 --> 04:32:51,370
Okay.

5775
04:32:52,790 --> 04:32:54,610
Yeah, this is...

5776
04:32:55,970 --> 04:32:57,550
This is actually near.

5777
04:33:01,640 --> 04:33:02,440
Okay.

5778
04:33:04,580 --> 04:33:05,160
Okay.

5779
04:33:05,800 --> 04:33:06,720
I've seen...

5780
04:33:06,720 --> 04:33:07,620
I figured it out.

5781
04:33:07,700 --> 04:33:08,920
I've downloaded everything.

5782
04:33:12,680 --> 04:33:13,260
My...

5783
04:33:13,260 --> 04:33:14,600
I now know what to do.

5784
04:33:16,040 --> 04:33:17,440
I figured it out.

5785
04:33:19,200 --> 04:33:20,340
Okay, it's right here.

5786
04:33:20,620 --> 04:33:23,500
I keep forgetting where the chains are.

5787
04:33:26,420 --> 04:33:27,000
Alright.

5788
04:33:27,840 --> 04:33:28,980
We got this.

5789
04:33:29,480 --> 04:33:30,720
We got this.

5790
04:33:34,130 --> 04:33:34,810
Okay.

5791
04:33:37,410 --> 04:33:38,710
Alright, you bait.

5792
04:33:39,030 --> 04:33:39,930
You go bait.

5793
04:33:41,630 --> 04:33:43,350
And then you poison him.

5794
04:33:43,730 --> 04:33:46,230
And then I'll do the actual job.

5795
04:33:49,690 --> 04:33:50,030
Okay.

5796
04:33:51,930 --> 04:33:53,070
Are you serious?

5797
04:33:53,410 --> 04:33:58,430
Are you seri- Tor- Tor- Tor- Tor- Tor- Tor- Tor- Tor-

5798
04:34:05,400 --> 04:34:06,420
That is fine.

5799
04:34:07,280 --> 04:34:08,380
That is fine.

5800
04:34:10,660 --> 04:34:11,900
That is fine.

5801
04:34:12,120 --> 04:34:13,060
That is fine.

5802
04:34:15,600 --> 04:34:18,280
Sometimes that happens in the video too, guys.

5803
04:34:19,400 --> 04:34:20,140
Sometimes...

5804
04:34:20,140 --> 04:34:23,520
Sometimes that happens in the video as well.

5805
04:34:28,410 --> 04:34:28,780
Okay.

5806
04:34:32,870 --> 04:34:33,240
What?

5807
04:34:37,870 --> 04:34:38,630
Oh my God.

5808
04:34:44,190 --> 04:34:44,630
Okay.

5809
04:34:45,290 --> 04:34:46,130
Oh no.

5810
04:34:47,070 --> 04:34:47,910
Oh no.

5811
04:34:49,110 --> 04:34:49,990
Oh

5812
04:34:53,280 --> 04:34:53,600
my God.

5813
04:34:53,820 --> 04:34:53,960
Thank God.

5814
04:34:55,560 --> 04:34:56,180
Thank God.

5815
04:34:56,760 --> 04:34:57,740
Oh my God.

5816
04:34:58,200 --> 04:34:59,100
No, not...

5817
04:34:59,100 --> 04:34:59,380
No.

5818
04:34:59,620 --> 04:35:00,060
No.

5819
04:35:04,980 --> 04:35:06,120
Oh no!

5820
04:35:12,070 --> 04:35:12,890
It's okay.

5821
04:35:12,890 --> 04:35:16,650
Okay, that fire is just very slowly approaching me.

5822
04:35:18,750 --> 04:35:21,370
Okay, that was obviously a...

5823
04:35:22,090 --> 04:35:24,950
Okay, okay, okay.

5824
04:35:25,350 --> 04:35:28,170
That, I will say, might be a little bullshit.

5825
04:35:40,000 --> 04:35:44,110
It's okay, I'm safe like in this little cubby hole I made for myself.

5826
04:35:44,890 --> 04:35:46,270
I feel so safe.

5827
04:35:49,270 --> 04:35:50,230
I feel so safe.

5828
04:35:56,040 --> 04:35:56,920
That's fine.

5829
04:35:57,500 --> 04:35:57,800
Oh my god.

5830
04:35:57,980 --> 04:35:58,340
No!

5831
04:35:58,760 --> 04:35:59,180
I caught it!

5832
04:35:59,540 --> 04:36:00,140
Awww!

5833
04:36:01,600 --> 04:36:02,500
I caught it.

5834
04:36:02,800 --> 04:36:06,000
I did too many choppy chops.

5835
04:36:06,240 --> 04:36:07,560
I chopped too much.

5836
04:36:08,740 --> 04:36:10,240
I got greedy.

5837
04:36:10,560 --> 04:36:11,760
I chopped too much.

5838
04:36:16,580 --> 04:36:18,300
Too many chops.

5839
04:36:19,700 --> 04:36:20,420
No!

5840
04:36:22,600 --> 04:36:24,180
Why did I chop?

5841
04:36:26,800 --> 04:36:28,540
I chopped till I dropped.

5842
04:36:31,380 --> 04:36:31,800
Okay.

5843
04:36:32,960 --> 04:36:34,360
Guys, I figured it out.

5844
04:36:34,560 --> 04:36:36,560
Guys, I figured, guys, look at me go.

5845
04:36:36,720 --> 04:36:37,360
I figured it out.

5846
04:36:37,440 --> 04:36:38,500
Okay, maybe I should actually...

5847
04:36:39,740 --> 04:36:42,140
I should really get, like...

5848
04:36:42,140 --> 04:36:42,420
Yeah.

5849
04:36:42,900 --> 04:36:44,760
Wait, is it boost fire damage?

5850
04:36:45,040 --> 04:36:45,240
Okay.

5851
04:36:45,520 --> 04:36:46,020
There we go.

5852
04:36:46,360 --> 04:36:48,580
I feel like that might be useful.

5853
04:36:48,980 --> 04:36:51,260
That may or may not be very useful.

5854
04:36:56,530 --> 04:36:57,830
Andre, thank you for the super chat.

5855
04:36:57,970 --> 04:36:58,210
Thank you.

5856
04:36:58,350 --> 04:36:58,910
Thank you.

5857
04:36:58,910 --> 04:36:58,930
Thank you.

5858
04:37:04,460 --> 04:37:04,860
Alright.

5859
04:37:08,970 --> 04:37:09,370
Okay.

5860
04:37:09,970 --> 04:37:10,890
Child, help me.

5861
04:37:11,090 --> 04:37:11,730
My child.

5862
04:37:11,730 --> 04:37:13,050
I got this.

5863
04:37:13,050 --> 04:37:13,330
I need it.

5864
04:37:13,530 --> 04:37:13,890
Tori.

5865
04:37:14,490 --> 04:37:15,830
We got this.

5866
04:37:21,360 --> 04:37:22,380
Got this.

5867
04:37:26,530 --> 04:37:28,190
We still got this.

5868
04:37:28,770 --> 04:37:29,270
I...

5869
04:37:36,880 --> 04:37:38,120
It's so fast.

5870
04:37:39,480 --> 04:37:40,140
We still...

5871
04:37:40,140 --> 04:37:42,000
Somehow, we're still gonna get it.

5872
04:37:59,310 --> 04:38:00,330
Oh my god.

5873
04:38:01,070 --> 04:38:02,370
Oh my god.

5874
04:38:04,050 --> 04:38:04,730
Okay.

5875
04:38:05,670 --> 04:38:06,190
It's fine.

5876
04:38:06,970 --> 04:38:07,690
It's fine.

5877
04:38:08,510 --> 04:38:09,250
It's fine.

5878
04:38:10,950 --> 04:38:11,630
It's fine.

5879
04:38:11,790 --> 04:38:12,470
Chop.

5880
04:38:12,630 --> 04:38:13,010
Chop.

5881
04:38:13,350 --> 04:38:13,570
Chop.

5882
04:38:13,790 --> 04:38:14,470
Chop.

5883
04:38:14,850 --> 04:38:15,490
Chop.

5884
04:38:19,700 --> 04:38:20,380
Chop.

5885
04:38:21,020 --> 04:38:21,200
Chop.

5886
04:38:21,760 --> 04:38:21,800
Chop.

5887
04:38:22,120 --> 04:38:22,280
Chop.

5888
04:38:22,280 --> 04:38:22,420
Chop.

5889
04:38:22,420 --> 04:38:22,520
Chop.

5890
04:38:22,860 --> 04:38:23,200
Shit!

5891
04:38:31,000 --> 04:38:36,680
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!

5892
04:38:40,640 --> 04:38:42,500
We keep chopping!

5893
04:38:42,940 --> 04:38:43,680
Torrance!

5894
04:38:44,400 --> 04:38:48,320
We keep chopping until we can't chop no more!

5895
04:38:49,160 --> 04:38:52,040
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

5896
04:38:53,660 --> 04:38:54,420
Shit!

5897
04:39:00,730 --> 04:39:01,490
Please.

5898
04:39:04,590 --> 04:39:05,350
Okay.

5899
04:39:08,710 --> 04:39:10,690
We chop till we drop.

5900
04:39:14,310 --> 04:39:15,070
Nice.

5901
04:39:15,070 --> 04:39:16,150
That's right.

5902
04:39:16,430 --> 04:39:17,930
Broke your legs!

5903
04:39:18,250 --> 04:39:19,530
Broke your ankles!

5904
04:39:19,890 --> 04:39:21,090
What you gonna do now?

5905
04:39:22,330 --> 04:39:23,370
That's right.

5906
04:39:23,730 --> 04:39:25,070
Achille heals you.

5907
04:39:25,930 --> 04:39:28,130
Oh, your precious fucking leg.

5908
04:39:28,490 --> 04:39:28,650
God!

5909
04:39:29,310 --> 04:39:29,810
That's right.

5910
04:39:29,890 --> 04:39:31,890
I went om-yom-yom and point fit your ankles.

5911
04:39:32,090 --> 04:39:32,910
Oh my god!

5912
04:39:33,110 --> 04:39:33,410
Did you...

5913
04:39:35,070 --> 04:39:36,310
What the fuck?!

5914
04:39:42,040 --> 04:39:44,320
Bro, he just ripped off his leg!

5915
04:39:45,540 --> 04:39:48,000
What am I gonna fight now?!

5916
04:40:00,200 --> 04:40:00,680
What?

5917
04:40:03,990 --> 04:40:05,870
Oh my god, he has three eyes!

5918
04:40:08,290 --> 04:40:09,770
Wait, what do...

5919
04:40:10,330 --> 04:40:11,770
What do I chop now?

5920
04:40:14,960 --> 04:40:15,620
What?

5921
04:40:15,820 --> 04:40:16,880
Chop your ass?

5922
04:40:17,580 --> 04:40:22,360
But... I don't underst... I don't understand!

5923
04:40:24,300 --> 04:40:24,700
What?

5924
04:40:25,100 --> 04:40:25,500
What?

5925
04:40:25,880 --> 04:40:26,000
What?

5926
04:40:29,100 --> 04:40:29,420
What?

5927
04:40:29,420 --> 04:40:30,580
Is this how it works?

5928
04:40:31,320 --> 04:40:31,720
I'm...

5929
04:40:32,560 --> 04:40:33,360
I...

5930
04:40:33,360 --> 04:40:33,780
Chop?

5931
04:40:34,500 --> 04:40:38,540
Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack your ass!

5932
04:40:40,640 --> 04:40:46,620
Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.

5933
04:40:48,100 --> 04:40:50,340
Oh, there was a critical?

5934
04:40:50,820 --> 04:40:52,240
I can't tell!

5935
04:40:52,800 --> 04:40:55,480
I'm just smacking the ass!

5936
04:40:56,840 --> 04:41:04,360
Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.

5937
04:41:08,600 --> 04:41:10,040
Smack, smack.

5938
04:41:15,140 --> 04:41:19,340
Okay, okay, he's... he's dead.

5939
04:41:21,380 --> 04:41:23,320
I don't know where to smack.

5940
04:41:25,760 --> 04:41:28,580
I actually don't know where to smack, guys.

5941
04:41:31,820 --> 04:41:33,740
I'm just gonna keep smacking here.

5942
04:41:33,740 --> 04:41:35,620
This is the only place I know.

5943
04:41:40,710 --> 04:41:41,630
Oh my god.

5944
04:41:42,090 --> 04:41:44,510
Oh my god, there's two fire things at me now.

5945
04:41:45,070 --> 04:41:46,110
Oh my god.

5946
04:41:50,130 --> 04:41:50,610
Oh!

5947
04:41:53,980 --> 04:41:55,960
It's okay, I can keep hitting his ass, right?

5948
04:42:02,230 --> 04:42:03,650
Oh my god, please.

5949
04:42:05,130 --> 04:42:06,430
Oh my god, please!

5950
04:42:18,930 --> 04:42:19,630
Let's go!

5951
04:42:20,890 --> 04:42:21,630
Yeah!

5952
04:42:22,470 --> 04:42:26,020
That's... that's fucking right!

5953
04:42:27,160 --> 04:42:28,260
Let's go!

5954
04:42:29,220 --> 04:42:31,160
Smacked his ass till he died.

5955
04:42:31,720 --> 04:42:32,580
What a way to go.

5956
04:42:32,580 --> 04:42:35,240
What a way to go.

5957
04:42:35,560 --> 04:42:36,740
What a way to go.

5958
04:42:38,240 --> 04:42:41,640
I'm gonna get one of those bad cats in these dragons.

5959
04:42:42,420 --> 04:42:44,440
Sensen, thank you for the super chat.

5960
04:42:44,600 --> 04:42:45,640
Thank you, thank you.

5961
04:42:45,940 --> 04:42:47,400
The power of chopping.

5962
04:42:48,180 --> 04:42:49,140
Let's go!

5963
04:42:49,560 --> 04:42:50,160
You know what?

5964
04:42:50,420 --> 04:42:51,640
Get in here.

5965
04:42:52,080 --> 04:42:55,180
I'll give you a little bit to drink, horse.

5966
04:42:55,920 --> 04:42:56,420
Let's...

5967
04:42:56,420 --> 04:42:57,220
Drink that!

5968
04:42:57,600 --> 04:42:59,120
Drink that to celebrate!

5969
04:43:00,460 --> 04:43:02,560
Sagen, thank you for the super chat.

5970
04:43:02,700 --> 04:43:03,480
Thank you, thank you.

5971
04:43:03,720 --> 04:43:04,340
Is there a grace?

5972
04:43:04,480 --> 04:43:05,240
Oh, there is a grace.

5973
04:43:05,500 --> 04:43:05,940
Let's go.

5974
04:43:07,840 --> 04:43:08,940
I'm just better.

5975
04:43:09,700 --> 04:43:10,540
Chop, chop, chop.

5976
04:43:11,500 --> 04:43:12,640
Chop this ass.

5977
04:43:14,640 --> 04:43:15,960
Let's fucking go.

5978
04:43:22,600 --> 04:43:26,060
I love how you ignored all the criticals.

5979
04:43:26,660 --> 04:43:28,280
Sometimes I just don't know.

5980
04:43:28,540 --> 04:43:28,760
Yeah.

5981
04:43:29,520 --> 04:43:31,680
So, do we do endurance and then vigor?

5982
04:43:32,100 --> 04:43:33,040
Is that good enough?

5983
04:43:35,940 --> 04:43:37,080
Endurance and vigor?

5984
04:43:38,120 --> 04:43:38,680
Or...

5985
04:43:39,700 --> 04:43:41,420
Or do we do strength...

5986
04:43:41,420 --> 04:43:42,360
Uh, any dexterity.

5987
04:43:42,540 --> 04:43:43,040
Or strength.

5988
04:43:45,460 --> 04:43:47,280
Oh, vigor, zen endurance?

5989
04:43:52,560 --> 04:43:54,780
How you dodge, like, four attacks.

5990
04:43:55,040 --> 04:43:57,300
I'm not even moving from his butt.

5991
04:43:57,580 --> 04:43:58,500
But I just kept...

5992
04:43:58,500 --> 04:43:59,940
I was, like, so confused.

5993
04:43:59,940 --> 04:44:01,360
I was like...

5994
04:44:02,040 --> 04:44:02,560
Why...

5995
04:44:02,560 --> 04:44:04,680
Am I not gonna get punished for that?

5996
04:44:05,060 --> 04:44:05,400
I...

5997
04:44:07,660 --> 04:44:09,060
I did not...

5998
04:44:09,060 --> 04:44:10,920
I literally was just going...

5999
04:44:10,920 --> 04:44:12,020
All I did was like...

6000
04:44:12,020 --> 04:44:14,880
Left click, left click, left click, left click.

6001
04:44:14,880 --> 04:44:17,180
Like, up his ass and then not got punished.

6002
04:44:17,660 --> 04:44:17,900
You know what?

6003
04:44:17,960 --> 04:44:19,240
I think that's a good time to end.

6004
04:44:19,420 --> 04:44:20,480
Never punish, guys.

6005
04:44:21,120 --> 04:44:21,400
Uh...

6006
04:44:25,040 --> 04:44:26,000
I think...

6007
04:44:26,000 --> 04:44:28,580
I think this is a good time...

6008
04:44:30,060 --> 04:44:30,540
Um...

6009
04:44:31,220 --> 04:44:31,700
Um...

6010
04:44:31,700 --> 04:44:32,260
Um...

6011
04:44:32,260 --> 04:44:32,320
Uh...

6012
04:44:32,320 --> 04:44:33,920
A good time...

6013
04:44:33,920 --> 04:44:35,380
To call it here, guys.

6014
04:44:36,040 --> 04:44:36,520
Uh...

6015
04:44:36,520 --> 04:44:39,620
This is the perfect spot to stop.

6016
04:44:40,060 --> 04:44:40,320
Yeah.

6017
04:44:40,600 --> 04:44:41,540
I think so, too.

6018
04:44:42,080 --> 04:44:42,320
Uh...

6019
04:44:42,320 --> 04:44:43,400
I won't be doing a...

6020
04:44:43,400 --> 04:44:44,060
Uh...

6021
04:44:44,060 --> 04:44:45,500
Super chat reading today.

6022
04:44:45,740 --> 04:44:47,260
Because tomorrow's gonna be a really long day.

6023
04:44:47,500 --> 04:44:47,980
So...

6024
04:44:47,980 --> 04:44:48,280
Uh...

6025
04:44:48,280 --> 04:44:50,480
I wanna make sure I have enough time to, you know...

6026
04:44:50,480 --> 04:44:51,480
Rest up...

6027
04:44:51,480 --> 04:44:51,700
Uh...

6028
04:44:51,700 --> 04:44:52,180
For...

6029
04:44:52,180 --> 04:44:53,820
For tomorrow's double streams.

6030
04:44:54,620 --> 04:44:55,100
Anyway...

6031
04:44:55,100 --> 04:44:56,740
Yeah, we beat two story bosses today.

6032
04:44:56,900 --> 04:44:57,840
We're almost hitting...

6033
04:44:57,840 --> 04:44:58,900
We're almost getting there.

6034
04:44:58,900 --> 04:45:00,260
Remembering the gold...

6035
04:45:00,260 --> 04:45:00,800
Uh...

6036
04:45:00,800 --> 04:45:01,580
The charity gold.

6037
04:45:01,780 --> 04:45:02,880
We're almost getting there.

6038
04:45:04,280 --> 04:45:04,840
Uh...

6039
04:45:06,300 --> 04:45:06,860
But...

6040
04:45:06,860 --> 04:45:08,200
I'm gonna call it here, everyone.

6041
04:45:08,760 --> 04:45:10,840
I hope you guys, uh...

6042
04:45:10,840 --> 04:45:12,020
Had a great time...

6043
04:45:12,580 --> 04:45:14,620
Hang out with me today for Elden Ring.

6044
04:45:14,740 --> 04:45:15,180
Don't worry.

6045
04:45:15,320 --> 04:45:16,360
We have another...

6046
04:45:16,360 --> 04:45:19,780
We have more Elden Ring later this week on Saturday.

6047
04:45:20,180 --> 04:45:20,540
So...

6048
04:45:20,540 --> 04:45:20,720
Yay!

6049
04:45:20,780 --> 04:45:21,400
More Elden Ring!

6050
04:45:21,800 --> 04:45:22,400
Hey, guys!

6051
04:45:23,360 --> 04:45:25,300
Thank you all for coming, guys.

6052
04:45:25,420 --> 04:45:25,600
See?

6053
04:45:25,700 --> 04:45:26,180
Look at that.

6054
04:45:26,400 --> 04:45:27,960
Our relationship is better now.

6055
04:45:28,080 --> 04:45:28,420
Like, see?

6056
04:45:28,900 --> 04:45:29,200
Look at that.

6057
04:45:29,340 --> 04:45:30,100
It's back to normal.

6058
04:45:30,780 --> 04:45:31,040
Look at that.

6059
04:45:31,140 --> 04:45:35,780
You and me, Dragoons, we are, like, good backseating and streamer.

6060
04:45:36,180 --> 04:45:38,800
Good backseating and streamer relationship, guys.

6061
04:45:39,020 --> 04:45:40,600
We have... it's very solid, strong.

6062
04:45:41,100 --> 04:45:43,440
Nothing can come between us, guys.

6063
04:45:47,080 --> 04:45:49,660
Wait, just scold me once and now.

6064
04:45:49,720 --> 04:45:51,120
You gotta try a little harder, Spencer.

6065
04:45:51,580 --> 04:45:52,740
Thank you for the super chat.

6066
04:45:52,880 --> 04:45:53,140
Thank you.

6067
04:45:53,280 --> 04:45:53,700
Thank you.

6068
04:45:55,680 --> 04:45:56,540
Anyway, guys.

6069
04:45:56,820 --> 04:45:59,320
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

6070
04:45:59,840 --> 04:46:00,540
Posture check.

6071
04:46:00,800 --> 04:46:02,900
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6072
04:46:03,260 --> 04:46:06,420
And if you said for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

6073
04:46:06,540 --> 04:46:08,000
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6074
04:46:08,440 --> 04:46:09,400
Bye, guys.

6075
04:46:10,080 --> 04:46:10,600
Bye.

6076
04:46:12,820 --> 04:46:13,440
It's okay.

6077
04:46:13,440 --> 04:46:14,440
You guys forgive me.

6078
04:46:14,740 --> 04:46:15,440
All is forgiven.

6079
04:46:16,860 --> 04:46:17,680
Bye-bye.
