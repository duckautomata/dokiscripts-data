00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Hey, I'm back, Dragoons!

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,340
Sponsored by EA, and they asked me to share my story.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,280
Thank you, EA.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,000
I sort of want to talk about how the game changed my life.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,500
I didn't really get into Apex until Season 2.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,080
It was actually my very first FPS game.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,560
I was so bad at it.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:22,940
I know, it's really hard to imagine me, the FPS VTuber, being bad at the FPS game she's known for.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,280
Like, I don't know how, but I somehow got to Predator Slash Top 500 on my first two seasons.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,340
I know life that game so hard.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,620
I played like 8 plus hours every day because it was just so addicting.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,480
There's just something about the game that made it really special.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,600
The gunplay, the movement, there's just no other game that was like this.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,060
If it wasn't for Apex, I wouldn't be here.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:55,380
I participated in worldwide tournaments, winning some of them too, played with some of the top players around the world, and created so many great memories.

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,180
I mean, I even became Gamer of the Year because of Apex.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:05,640
It also led to some of my most viral moments in my career, like the snakebite question and, are you and Peter still together?

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,760
It's actually crazy.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,480
So many people I used to watch and idolize when I was a nobody who are now my friends, know who I am, or like, even fans of me.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,080
They're like top 10 in the world, and they're like, I'm actually a Dragoon, Doki.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,740
And I'm like, what?

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,880
You're a Dragoon?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,620
I'm just a little guy trying to make people laugh while pew-pewing.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,280
But somehow, you guys just really enjoyed watching it.

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,680
So, yeah, Apex did change my life.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,020
It led me to become the Doki you see here today.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,980
So, thank you Apex, Respawn, and EA for creating a game that started my career.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,880
It really is a very special game.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,020
And that's my Apex Legends story.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,980
What's yours?
