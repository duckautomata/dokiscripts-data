1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Well, I don't fucking know.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,800
You want to change your recall bind, maybe?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,980
I throw my Q.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,700
The recall bind is your character utility option, so it's probably H.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,840
You can hold Q, by the way, to throw it out without needing to double tap.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,460
Oh my god, I'm live now.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,040
Guys, I think we're fucked.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,620
I understand.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,080
No, no.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,960
We're fine.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,620
The moment I realized we're fucked was when Mac was like, Oh boy.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,560
To me.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,180
With zero confidence that I was the captain.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,360
No, no, no.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,580
I'm confident in us.

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,740
I'm not so sure about tempo.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,520
I have so much confidence.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm going to show you guys who I had to pick between.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,120
Alright, Mac.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,040
Here's a list of other people that we could have had.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,380
And you tell me if tempo was the best pick there.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,440
I won't say it out loud.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,520
But here it is.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,120
Here's a list of people I had left.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,620
Oh wait, I need to add you.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,580
You're not my friend on this account.

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,240
The thing is...

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,300
Here we go.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,200
These are the six other people I could have picked.

30
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,460
No boosted weapons for this one.

31
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,820
Hotspot landing.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,580
If you land Draft Point or Shipyard.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
I think FireDragon was the controller player.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,860
We may have messed up.

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,620
Huh?

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,020
FireDragon doesn't even play this game.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,020
I thought he does.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,120
Wait, am I tweaking?

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,820
Isn't there another FireDragon?

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,260
No, FireDragon doesn't play Apex.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,300
Am I tweaking?

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,900
He's a fucking variety player.

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,520
I had to double check every streamer to make sure.

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,120
There's someone whose name is similar to FireDragon who plays Apex.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,800
Five months ago, he was opening my Apex account.

46
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,420
He was playing Pokemon cards.

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,580
Who am I thinking of?

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,980
There's another Dragon person.

49
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,280
Five days ago, he was playing Pokemon Colosseum.

50
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,340
I might be tweaking.

51
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,900
I was pretty sure.

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Oh, wait.

53
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,980
Guys, we can't use Crypto this first game.

54
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,980
Oh, shit.

55
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,720
Okay, we're fucked.

56
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,780
We have Ash, Ballistic, Alter, Wraith, Vantage, Rampart, Caustic, and Mirage.

57
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,960
Play Rampart, get a charge rifle.

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,820
That's you, Tempo.

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,620
I was going to say Caustic and charge rifle, but yeah, same thing.

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Okay, so what do I play?

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,000
As captain, I nominate Mac as honorary captain.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,420
I'm giving my role to you.

63
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,620
Ash, Ballistic, Alter, Wraith, Vantage, Rampart, Caustic, and Mirage.

64
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,620
Okay, I lost track.

65
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,160
I already forgot what you just said.

66
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,320
I can see it.

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,580
It's in the announcements channel.

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,240
Okay.

69
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,120
Oh, God.

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,760
Okay.

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
This is way too much information for the first game.

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,540
You play Rampart, Tempo.

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,800
Oh, thank God.

74
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,140
I can put walls.

75
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,500
Doki, do you want to be a bastard and play Vantage and just two-tap people?

76
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll play Vantage.

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,940
I was literally playing Vantage two days ago.

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Okay, you do that, and then I'll play...

79
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll play Ash.

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Yo, the map is mostly blue, right?

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,100
Why is there so many information in game one?

82
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,660
This is like seven paragraphs.

83
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,980
This is like...

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,700
Confused as shit.

85
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,760
This is way too many words for game one.

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,740
This is even seven...

87
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,180
This is eight paragraphs of information.

88
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,440
Okay, do I pick the brown skin?

89
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,940
The rainbow colored skin?

90
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,440
The rainbow colored skin?

91
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,740
Because it's like...

92
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm looking like a galaxy, bro.

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,640
Like a neon style, right?

94
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,100
Or do I go pink or blue?

95
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,860
Because it's also pink and blue.

96
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,760
The map.

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,180
Do you have the...

98
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,640
Dude, I have none of these golden thingies.

99
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,180
You don't have...

100
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,660
I have this one.

101
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,820
Do you have the one that's colored in paint?

102
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,720
Paint?

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,580
Wait, do we really need camouflage?

104
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,280
It's called Holika.

105
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,600
Is it purple, yellow, or blue?

106
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,000
Guys, I'm gonna put on a pink skin.

107
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,940
Nope, I do not.

108
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,340
I don't even have that one listed on here.

109
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
Holika's goaded.

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,200
That's camouflaged enough.

111
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,460
Blue one.

112
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,220
Because blue will blend into it more.

113
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,260
Alright, so we got...

114
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,820
Oh, wait.

115
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,520
We got rampart walls and a charge rifle.

116
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,700
Exactly.

117
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,460
That's what I was cooking up for you.

118
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,240
I got you, bro.

119
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,160
Alright.

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,180
So, if you land draft point or ship bird, you get one extra point.

121
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,340
But, I feel like a lot of people will land there.

122
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,080
Hmm.

123
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,880
Maybe.

124
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,760
Doki, what are we doing for drop spots?

125
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,580
I don't...

126
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,100
I nominated Mac as honorary captain.

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,000
You think I know?

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,500
He literally was playing rank in this map.

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,060
That drop spot channel just has a bunch of...

130
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,320
Everyone just trying to big dick each other and telling each other to go somewhere else.

131
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,160
And it's just filled with not drop spots.

132
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,760
How is there like 17 messages already in this?

133
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,840
Everyone has ADHD.

134
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,080
Oh my god.

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,120
Bro, I'm not processed anything.

136
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,720
I've been awake since 7 in the morning.

137
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm not...

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm not ready for this.

139
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,160
Wait, did you get a map thingy and you're X-ing out all the POIs that are taken?

140
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,680
Is that what Mac's doing?

141
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,760
You think I'm that dedicated?

142
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,500
Hell no.

143
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,540
You organized scrims.

144
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,300
So I thought you had it.

145
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,580
Temple, you organized scrims.

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,780
You should do that for us.

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,420
You picked the...

148
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,480
You're off work.

149
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,820
What do you mean you're off work?

150
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm not working.

151
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,500
You're literally making money by streaming.

152
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,660
You're on work now.

153
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,560
Speak for yourself.

154
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,960
This is work time now.

155
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,220
No matter what, you're in a Twitch Rivals.

156
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,560
You get automatic money.

157
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,740
So you are working.

158
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,840
Off the clock.

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,640
That's what he said.

160
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,740
That's what I was trying to figure out except I just...

161
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,760
English.

162
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,980
I would...

163
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,510
You would what?

164
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,610
Oh, he muted himself.

165
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,110
We'll never know.

166
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,590
We'll never know what he said.

167
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,970
Oh no.

168
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,330
Someone in my chat was saying that they could do the...

169
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,510
Chrono was saying that he could do the DropSpot thingy.

170
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:55,790
But the DropSpot channel is just more than 50% filled with messages of yeah, of...

171
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,970
not actual DropSpots.

172
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,490
So it's just a pain in the ass trying to go through it all.

173
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:06,190
I said we're going Neon on E-District, Overlook on World's Edge, and Mill on Stormpoint.

174
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,790
Okay.

175
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,210
Is E-District first?

176
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,830
I think.

177
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,610
Okay, if E-District is first then um...

178
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,010
then we have Revival.

179
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,850
You know like you know the strat we should do?

180
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:28,050
We should have one of us as in Mac go like bully other teams and just drop non stop on them and then we'll just loot.

181
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,650
Okay.

182
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,490
That sounds like a good plan.

183
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,050
You like revive indefinitely until you don't.

184
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,790
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:46,970
That's literally what I did before the stream because I was trying to fucking leave the game but like they kept staying alive.

186
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,210
Go pick your legends now.

187
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,430
I got Vantage ready.

188
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,230
I'm on Ashe already.

189
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,690
Yeah.

190
00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:00,790
I guarantee you someone will fuck up and they will get negative 5 points for picking the wrong thing.

191
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,810
That's funny.

192
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:13,290
There's like a 90% chance a team ends this entire tournament with negative points because they didn't get any and they get negative points for picking the wrong thing.

193
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,470
I've never seen anybody ever get negative points.

194
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,690
Never in my life.

195
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,710
Every Twitch Rivals I've done nobody has ever gotten negative.

196
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,610
Did they?

197
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,910
Have they done like you get negative points for every Twitch Rivals?

198
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,910
There's possibilities.

199
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,030
I've done so many Twitch Rivals.

200
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,110
Did we take a negative the last one we did?

201
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:34,950
Doki.

202
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,750
Who got negative?

203
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,810
I'm pretty sure the last thing we did we got a negative because one of us locked the wrong thing one game.

204
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,590
Was that with Doki?

205
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,550
I think it was.

206
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,570
No we didn't get a negative!

207
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,070
I'm pretty sure we did.

208
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,730
We did not get negative!

209
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,310
Was it the Apex North tournament that you perhaps put in where you got a negative?

210
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,450
There's no way I do not remember!

211
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,910
Yeah you definitely blocked that out of your memory from trauma.

212
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,240
Yeah I did.

213
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,060
Most likely.

214
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,180
Wait this game is strictly placement points?

215
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,900
What?

216
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
Wait what?

217
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,640
I don't know.

218
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,820
People in chat are...

219
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,580
People tweaking?

220
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,380
You still get points for kills right?

221
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,780
It's just not the extra point?

222
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,800
Yeah yeah you still get points for kills.

223
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,280
Yeah okay.

224
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,520
You still get points for kills it's just the boosted guns give you extra points.

225
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,320
Oh the boosted guns?

226
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,680
But there's no boosted guns for this first game.

227
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh no boosted guns for this first game?

228
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,540
Okay.

229
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,140
Yep.

230
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,280
Okay.

231
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,880
Wait is the lobby up yet?

232
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,080
Yep.

233
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,780
Okay.

234
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,600
Why did no one say it?

235
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,240
Wait where the fuck's the lobby code?

236
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,760
Uh in announcements.

237
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,940
Oh it's an announcement?

238
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
Do we want a con creased up at Mill?

239
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,200
Do we want a con creased up at Mill?

240
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,180
I didn't see them say they were going there.

241
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,000
Did they just say it?

242
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,140
Not the last person here.

243
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,380
That's all that matters.

244
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,620
I think we can fight them at Mill yeah?

245
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
Everyone just win their ones?

246
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,200
Against their counterpart?

247
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,720
Yeah yeah.

248
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,520
As long as we all win our ones right?

249
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,720
We can do that.

250
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,080
Oh wait wait wait.

251
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,640
Wait what game?

252
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,760
You said next game right?

253
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,240
What for what?

254
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,660
Mill?

255
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,040
Uh I don't know.

256
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,960
Apparently Overlook is also conned.

257
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,020
They said conning Overlook of all POIs.

258
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,880
All I said is a con is a two way thing fellas.

259
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,340
What isn't?

260
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,480
I thought you said the map.

261
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh wait no that's the other maps.

262
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,300
What map?

263
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,400
Where's free?

264
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,180
Where is free?

265
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,600
I don't know.

266
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,900
Tempo bring up your fucking LGS maps.

267
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,860
I don't have a map thingy.

268
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,440
Bring up your LGS maps.

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,200
The moment I load into the game as a player my brain turns off.

270
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,620
What do you mean you're always loading?

271
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,860
As an observer.

272
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,820
Well actually my...

273
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,080
To be fair as an observer your brain is also off.

274
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,660
Don't lie to me.

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
So it's just always off.

276
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,460
You literally told me that sometimes when you're when you're watching scrims you go to sleep.

277
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,260
You take a nap in the middle.

278
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,880
Yes you did!

279
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,440
Guess what?

280
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,540
Oh no no I know I know.

281
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,080
Guess what?

282
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,600
If you open my stream I now have a couch right beside my computer.

283
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,580
Now now I don't even have to go to my room to sleep.

284
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,940
I can just turn around in my chair and roll over and I can fall asleep.

285
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,920
Guys this is the...

286
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,380
For those who don't know who Tempo is guys he is the official organizer for all scrims in Apex Legends.

287
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,620
From the Apex World Cup to the official LGS.

288
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,080
He is in charge of that.

289
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,500
And he goes to sleep after he sets it up.

290
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey I wake up before it ends.

291
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,740
As long as you wake up before it ends.

292
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,380
Most of the time so just keep the lobby up until you wake up.

293
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,860
Sometimes Wig yells at me cause I have his stream open and if he yells loud enough I can hear it and then I wake up.

294
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah guys he gets paid to do this guys.

295
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,640
He gets okay actually no I don't think I think you do this as a as a hobby.

296
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Like I'm pretty sure you get paid to manage TSM but for this it's just a hobby.

297
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,980
Which is a fucked up hobby to have.

298
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,780
Not gonna lie.

299
00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:01,680
Like why would you have like you get abused by your players here all the time like at this point I feel like you enjoy that.

300
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,780
It's okay it's the same thing as teaching kids.

301
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,680
Which is what I did for like 10 years.

302
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,380
But it makes you drink less.

303
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Yeah there's less alcohol involved.

304
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,280
Yeah I remember you told me that teaching children.

305
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,820
Wait we're conning Johnny's team at Neon?

306
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Wait are we?

307
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,500
Johnny's at Neon?

308
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,220
Who's at Neon?

309
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,100
Johnny to back the fuck up.

310
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,380
I look through and people just change their shit.

311
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,500
It's Neon and Zap.

312
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,180
Oh no that's the guy I was supposed to have.

313
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,320
It's okay we can just go over and kill him.

314
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,400
It was a hard 50-50 but I ended up picking you Mac.

315
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,040
You got picked over Zap.

316
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,940
Wait how do I open the oh shit game is starting.

317
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,140
Wait are we conning?

318
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,920
Are we conning?

319
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,920
I don't know I don't know we're figuring stuff out.

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,720
I moved us around.

321
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,980
We'll just wing it and let's see.

322
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,640
We'll just wing it and see uh.

323
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,680
Two POI's.

324
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,460
And die.

325
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,860
Okay we'll see.

326
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,780
I couldn't type the second half.

327
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Alright we'll see how it goes.

328
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,800
Do we want to just see where people are flying to and then go from there then?

329
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,500
I just simply.

330
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
No let's just do it.

331
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,340
I don't know.

332
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,580
I don't know.

333
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,440
Let's just do it.

334
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,080
Just one of us has to live at this.

335
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,640
As long as one of us is alive we'll be fine right?

336
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,240
Where's my rampart?

337
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,200
What do you mean where's your rampart?

338
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,140
Things are going so well right now.

339
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,060
He's locked in.

340
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,200
He's so locked in.

341
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:34,960
Alright.

342
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,640
I got my vantage in.

343
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,920
Do we just react drop on this?

344
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,900
No I thought we were going to Neon.

345
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,900
And we're going to go find Zap.

346
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,980
And uh.

347
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,020
And uh.

348
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,320
Nia and Johnny?

349
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,340
Yeah.

350
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,120
Wait they got Johnny there?

351
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,800
Is it like Apex Johnny?

352
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
No no Johnny, Price, TV.

353
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Whoever he is.

354
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,580
Who the fuck is that guy?

355
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,420
I thought a team with Nia, Johnny, and Zap got approved.

356
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,020
I was like wait.

357
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,900
God no.

358
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,880
Because Zap's not a captain.

359
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm going to keep an eye out on every POI.

360
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,980
See if there's...

361
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm going air.

362
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,220
Oh my god.

363
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,840
We know this guy isn't asleep.

364
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,520
Wait what happened?

365
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,040
Is this what scrims are like when you're not asleep?

366
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,900
Is this what scrims are like when you're not asleep?

367
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,140
Someone picked the wrong legend.

368
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,040
Minus 5 points.

369
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,500
No because they always get like a freebie.

370
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,940
There's no way.

371
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,020
No there should not be a freebie.

372
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,000
It's minus 5.

373
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,500
Fuck the freebies.

374
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,820
You get freebies too.

375
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,480
Yeah.

376
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,040
That's for a DC.

377
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,720
And accidentally picking the wrong thing.

378
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,840
Yeah.

379
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,560
But you get freebies in your own tournaments.

380
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,380
Oh it was Timmy.

381
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,680
Timmy picked the wrong.

382
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,840
Kick Timmy out.

383
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Timmy minus 5.

384
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,340
Minus 5.

385
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,700
Minus 5 for Timmy.

386
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,740
He should not get privileges.

387
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,580
Minus 5.

388
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,100
What's that thing when you give someone...

389
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,640
Special...

390
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,680
Oh wait.

391
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,200
Special treatment.

392
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,820
Everybody should...

393
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,360
No privileges.

394
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Minus 5.

395
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,500
If he doesn't get a minus 5...

396
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,580
He's gonna get his minus 5 back anyway.

397
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,360
That means his uncle works at Twitch.

398
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,300
Timmy you don't need this extra money.

399
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,940
You're already rich.

400
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,140
I don't need it either.

401
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm just here for the vibes.

402
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,760
People picking?

403
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,320
What?

404
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,500
Someone said minus 10.

405
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,540
You just said minus 10.

406
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,120
Which means there's two people that...

407
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,840
There's two people in his own team that didn't pick a legend?

408
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,860
Oh wait.

409
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,080
Cause if he didn't pick his legend and it auto picks...

410
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,120
Something.

411
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,240
Then the other teammate would have auto picked something else.

412
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,880
The Bangalore and Fuse on that team.

413
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,580
Oh.

414
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,960
Minus 10.

415
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,260
There should be like one freebie for the entire tournament.

416
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,340
And Timmy used it.

417
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,720
No.

418
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,100
No freebie for anyone.

419
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,860
Minus points everywhere.

420
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,240
Minus points everywhere.

421
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,120
There's no...

422
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,740
You're right Chad.

423
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,440
With all the moving and Uber trips.

424
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,180
I might need this money too.

425
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,600
Uber trips?

426
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah I'm like moving.

427
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,700
But like my setup is still at my old place.

428
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,900
Wait you're moving with an Uber?

429
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,960
No as in like...

430
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,280
No as in my old setup.

431
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,840
My old setup is still at my old place.

432
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,420
So I have to go back and forth.

433
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
And sometimes like if I have to work really late.

434
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,480
I have to take an Uber back to my new place.

435
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,420
Because there's no public transport.

436
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,660
It's not that late.

437
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,300
I got two houses so I got an Uber back and forth.

438
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,500
So why haven't you moved your setup?

439
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,300
My lease is ending.

440
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,880
And it's also an apartment.

441
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
I got two houses so I got an Uber back and forth.

442
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,120
With my Uber prime.

443
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,320
Oh yeah Uber premium.

444
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,260
I get the Uber luxury order.

445
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,540
Like the ones with the luxury.

446
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,000
I cannot take an Uber unless it's a Tesla.

447
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,980
There's an Uber helicopter too.

448
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,820
A Tesla limousine just pulls up.

449
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,260
Yeah no like what was it?

450
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,480
The cyberpunk Tesla?

451
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,000
The cyber truck?

452
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,340
Yeah the cyber truck.

453
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,640
You cannot pick me up on Uber unless it's a cyber truck.

454
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,120
You have standards.

455
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,360
You're gonna stall in the middle of the road.

456
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,940
Someone's like dookie Teslas are death traps now.

457
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,700
Good I like it.

458
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,240
The little excitement.

459
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,100
The best part is you don't know if you'll survive.

460
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,420
That's the best part.

461
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,800
Where were we trying to land last time?

462
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,820
I don't know.

463
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
We were trying to land here right?

464
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,480
We were trying to land next time.

465
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,200
Wait.

466
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,060
Yo guys.

467
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
There's one person over here.

468
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,620
We can land here.

469
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,580
Who is that solo?

470
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,660
We can just land on that idiot.

471
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,700
Why did you listen to him?

472
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,120
No one's here.

473
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,700
Why wouldn't I listen to him?

474
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,280
This is their safety net.

475
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,540
We're killing their safety net.

476
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,720
The other two are going for kills.

477
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,520
Alright.

478
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,140
You guys can go shoot him.

479
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
I'm going to loot.

480
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,420
Go get him.

481
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,020
Go get him.

482
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,060
I threw a nade at him by mistake.

483
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,740
What is this zipline mechanic shit?

484
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,820
I don't know what's going on.

485
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,040
I believe in you guys.

486
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,100
I'm going to keep looting.

487
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,320
I ran into a wall.

488
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,660
Get a safety net.

489
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,380
I'm so confused.

490
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
What is a safety net?

491
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,960
His teammates are going to go get killed.

492
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,280
And this guy is their safety net.

493
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,300
Who's going to keep them alive?

494
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,780
That's what I was saying.

495
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,120
That's what I wanted Mac to do.

496
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,040
But he's going to die.

497
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,360
Because we landed on him.

498
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,340
We killed the safety.

499
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,280
He was meant to not die.

500
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,980
His teammates are going out and getting kills.

501
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,400
That's why he landed alone.

502
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,280
He's going to hide.

503
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,120
He was supposed to be you on crypto.

504
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,940
You were supposed to be...

505
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,300
I'm still confused.

506
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,120
But we got a kill.

507
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,400
Tempo is just...

508
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,140
How did you get this far in life?

509
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
I don't know.

510
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,760
For the guy who gathers statistics and stuff.

511
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,840
For the guy who is basically the lifeline of the Apex community.

512
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,220
What are these giant green balls that keep disappearing on my map?

513
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,440
That's people spawning.

514
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,060
Don't worry about the balls, Tempo.

515
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,700
Don't worry about them.

516
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,720
Alright, let's see.

517
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,680
Let me know when to scan.

518
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
Should we be roughly together?

519
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,800
No.

520
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,860
Okay.

521
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,040
As long as one of us is alive, we all live.

522
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,860
I think they're all farming kills for the kill points.

523
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,380
Probably.

524
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,860
Do I land with my attachments at least?

525
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,360
Oh, okay.

526
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,340
Mac is going to leave us so he can be our farmer.

527
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,060
This is why I picked you over Zap.

528
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,780
Mac is going to leave?

529
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,960
Wait, which one is Mac?

530
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,660
Oh, blue.

531
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,640
No, green.

532
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,300
Mac is green.

533
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,300
Mac is the one with the name Alverlele on top.

534
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,020
I'm going with blue.

535
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,460
Are you looking at the colors when you can see the names?

536
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
Well, because I'm looking at the minimap colors.

537
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,580
Looking at the minimap colors?

538
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,260
Oh, I just thought you were being a little special today.

539
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,640
I'm going to the blue area.

540
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, damn.

541
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,360
This is why you're not a TSM anymore.

542
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,300
Bro.

543
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,420
Oh, no.

544
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,520
Here's everybody.

545
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,420
Oh, that's fucked up.

546
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,220
Wait.

547
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,860
Guys, I need a backpack.

548
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,200
Wait, someone's...

549
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,300
No, that's me.

550
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,360
Carry extra ammo or alt cooldown.

551
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,860
Ooh, alt cooldown.

552
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,560
Wait, I scanned zone, so...

553
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,820
Are we going to zone, then?

554
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,440
Yeah, I guess.

555
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,520
I mean, we just need kills, too.

556
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,500
I need a backpack.

557
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,320
Why do you not have a...

558
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,560
Holy shit, you don't.

559
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm getting involved.

560
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,740
Alright, you go get involved.

561
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,860
I'm just going to keep looting.

562
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,440
Okay, have fun.

563
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,880
Alright, we're the lifelines here.

564
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,460
Usually, it's two lifelines, but, like, only one of us is useful right now in terms of killing people.

565
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, that's right.

566
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,960
Only one of us has damage.

567
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,480
Me.

568
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,420
That's true, Deadpool.

569
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,540
Maybe you should be the one that's going to kill people.

570
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Yeah, that's right.

571
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,940
We actually shouldn't be using this.

572
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,320
Oh, shit!

573
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,260
You gotta kill it!

574
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,260
I knocked one.

575
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,440
Okay, well, come back.

576
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,000
Wait, does a knock equal a kill?

577
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,380
No.

578
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
No, I don't think so.

579
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,200
It's alright, the lifelines are still alive.

580
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,920
Welcome back.

581
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,320
I've returned.

582
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,460
Wait, doesn't this game go on forever, then?

583
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,920
A while, yeah.

584
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,500
Yeah, technically, if you play smart, yeah.

585
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,020
This is why I was so frustrated, because I lived for way too long when I wanted to fucking leave.

586
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,660
I guess I don't need to do ring console if you're doing that, Tempo.

587
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,180
Sure.

588
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,460
I'll just get the ultimate reload.

590
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,000
Why does it force me straight down?

591
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,160
I have a limit to how far I can fly.

592
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,360
Really?

593
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,280
Do you spawn with your guns?

594
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah, you spawn with everything.

595
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,920
It's literally three strikes.

596
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
So you have all your stuff.

597
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,820
And attachments and everything?

598
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,120
Yep.

599
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,360
Everything.

600
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,460
You get everything back.

601
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,040
Find me a golden treasure chest.

602
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm gonna give you intel.

603
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
I have a thing here.

604
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,680
Found a backpack, guys.

605
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,600
I keep forgetting that I'm advantage.

606
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,720
So I can...

607
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,400
They're, like, sliding down, like, this way.

608
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,740
Down the street, you can shoot them in the back.

609
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,160
Alright, here you go.

610
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,020
Here's intel.

611
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,840
Whoa!

612
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,400
Okay.

613
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,760
There's a lot more people than I expected.

614
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,480
Ahem.

615
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I'm running towards you.

616
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,480
They're coming to me now.

617
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,500
I'm here.

618
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,360
I'm heading over.

619
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,040
We might get run at, though.

620
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,960
Because there's three other teams around us.

621
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,140
That's fine.

622
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,800
Tempo will live.

623
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,860
Tempo, you have to live for us.

624
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,680
They're going up the balloon.

625
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,940
One more is gonna go up late.

626
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,340
I hit zero damage.

627
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Oh, I'm not even looking at it.

628
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,160
He's 1 HP!

629
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,140
He's 1 HP!

630
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,340
I don't have angle!

631
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,100
Oh, shit!

632
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,920
Did you down him off the balloon?

633
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,940
His controller won't be able to reach it.

634
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,980
Where is he down?

635
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,680
I heard somebody landing near us.

636
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,020
I got him.

637
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,380
Yeah, he's facing.

638
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,740
Does he have a charge rifle?

639
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,560
No.

640
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,220
Uh...

641
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,880
Let's go this way.

642
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,160
Let's just focus our team.

643
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,520
No reason.

644
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,600
I just want to target them.

645
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,980
I just want to target them.

646
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,140
Wait, is this someone we know?

647
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,120
No, I don't think so.

648
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm just gonna set my sights on them.

649
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,380
I'm just gonna set my sights on them.

650
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,080
Come here, free kills!

651
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,080
He just wants to cyberbully today.

652
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,660
He just wants to cyberbully today.

653
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,140
Yeah, they just look bullyable.

654
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,940
Damn!

655
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,940
Look at this entire map.

656
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,580
Somebody's gonna push that and send that over to Twitch.

657
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,100
Somebody's gonna push that and send that over to Twitch.

658
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,500
I will take that ash portal.

659
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,980
Get me out of here.

660
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,380
I don't want to stop playing, but I need help.

661
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,520
I don't want to stop playing, but I need help.

662
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,580
He's portaling for this.

663
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,800
He took it back, Ken.

664
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,400
I'm gonna take this.

665
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,020
I'll be back.

666
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,740
Oh, shit!

667
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,700
There's a dude right here!

668
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, wait.

669
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,180
I'm a fucking Rampart!

670
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,540
Oh!

671
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,760
I'm leaving!

672
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm leaving!

673
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,920
Dude, this game is horrible!

674
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,460
Okay, we're fucked!

675
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,480
Mac, you have to die!

676
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,300
You have to die so you can start the respawn timer!

677
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,860
You have to die so you can start the respawn timer!

678
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,200
Okay, alright.

679
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,040
The game wouldn't let me in the portal!

680
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,420
I walked out of it and walked through it six times!

681
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,640
We would have seen that first.

682
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,460
Guys...

683
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm a tree.

684
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,600
I mean, I'm a desk.

685
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,820
There's so many people here.

686
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,540
Why the fuck wouldn't it let me back in?

687
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,260
Oh my god.

688
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,820
Where do we go, Mac?

689
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,860
Where do we go?

690
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,360
We're chillin'.

691
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,720
Don't worry.

692
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,120
We're fine.

693
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,300
We had a moment where all three of us were gonna die at the same time from three different teams.

694
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,840
We had a moment where all three of us were gonna die at the same time from three different teams.

695
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,040
We have to have Tempo chill over here somewhere.

696
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,140
We have to have Tempo chill over here somewhere.

697
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,200
Build a castle there, Tempo.

698
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,400
Okay, Tempo, you're our lifeline.

699
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,660
I'm gonna be in a tree.

700
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,540
Okay.

701
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,520
Go build a castle.

702
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,420
You're not in zone.

703
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,460
I landed on a team.

704
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,400
I don't even know where to go!

705
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,780
You guys are all a mess!

706
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,220
There's a team above me.

707
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,420
Okay, let me see.

708
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,640
Oh, I'm in a house with a rampart.

709
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,880
Tempo.

710
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,600
Tempo, please.

711
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,000
Go over here, bro!

712
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm trying!

713
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,260
Where are you going?

714
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
You're on the opposite way!

715
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,740
Tempo!

716
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,860
I need to move, but in a second.

717
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,140
Please!

718
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,320
I'm not okay right now!

719
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,480
See, there's a lot of people there.

720
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,500
Go over here.

721
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,060
I'm in the right hidden spot.

722
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,880
Why did you climb up?

723
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,340
Oh, there's a...

724
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,540
Okay, I'll climb up.

725
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,520
Where is the tree?

726
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,480
Okay.

727
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,060
Stay up here and just do stuff.

728
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,500
Alright, we'll be here together, I guess.

729
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
No, you're gonna watch over me and do stuff.

730
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,440
Okay, there's a...

731
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,540
There's one over here on the caustic.

732
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,380
There's two on these stairs in front of me.

733
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,760
There's guys here, too.

734
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,580
There's a caustic right here.

735
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh, nice!

736
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,080
Caustic is getting shot at.

737
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,600
Did you get them?

738
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,800
What the fuck is this guy?

739
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,300
Okay, nice.

740
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,360
See, this is...

741
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,220
This is good.

742
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,860
You're the killer.

743
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,440
Behind you over there.

744
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,920
Oh my god, guys!

745
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,520
We're not the last team.

746
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,820
We're not last.

747
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,000
Somebody actually died in revival.

748
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,920
That's so funny.

749
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
That's mean.

750
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,440
Wow.

751
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,280
She wanted to say someone really sucks and they died 20th.

752
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,100
I didn't say that.

753
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,800
You said that.

754
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,980
Is that a mirage clone or is that a real people?

755
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,520
I said we're not last.

756
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,920
I literally said not last.

757
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,700
Because I'm happy about us getting this far.

758
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,680
Havoc.

759
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,120
Can you give me some shield cells, Mac?

760
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,940
Yeah.

761
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,480
Thank you.

762
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,660
That's five.

763
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,040
I'm one cell form.

764
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,720
And a bat.

765
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,860
I can't get up there.

766
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,100
I'll come up.

767
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
I'll come up from inside.

768
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,920
This guy's a charge rifle.

769
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,980
We could kill him later.

770
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,040
Oh, and now I can get my charge rifle.

771
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,640
Right here.

772
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,300
Thank you.

773
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,020
I really need... Oh, that's a lot of bats.

774
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,520
Wait, do we have this house to ourselves?

775
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,380
Yes.

776
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, bro.

777
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,600
Yeah, we do.

778
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,780
Because we have it.

779
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,840
We've had it for ourselves for a while.

780
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,840
Oh, wait.

781
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,580
Is this a charge rifle?

782
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,960
Is that Timmy's team that got last?

783
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,120
Well, that's a charge rifle.

784
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,440
Oh, my God.

785
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,300
Sorry, Timmy.

786
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,760
Yo.

787
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,680
Minus ten game one and negative stuff.

788
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,380
Maybe you should have taken the minus ten.

789
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,780
You're a sniper?

790
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,340
Two taps people on blue now, by the way.

791
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,600
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,140
I know, but he's...

793
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,640
Wait, there's someone in here with us.

794
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,020
Someone's over here by me.

795
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm down.

796
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm down.

797
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,660
Help me.

798
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,520
Just die now.

799
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,020
Just die now.

800
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,780
Yeah, bleed out.

801
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,360
Just bleed out.

802
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,780
Bleed out, Tempo.

803
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,800
They're up here.

804
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,140
They're where I wanted Tempo to set up.

805
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,260
Tempo, Tempo, bleed out.

806
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,820
Bleed out, please.

807
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
Hold the button.

808
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,340
Okay, that's good.

809
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,640
Tempo, where I told you to set up, there's a whole team in there.

810
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,120
You rat.

811
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
You fucking rat.

812
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,560
I told you to set up over here before.

813
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,140
I went up there and then there was a full team there.

814
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,340
And I was like, oh, I'm dead.

815
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,160
I told you to do it like 20 minutes ago.

816
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,960
So you should have been this whole time.

817
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
We've lost our spot, Tempo.

818
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,880
All right, wait.

819
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,780
I can land on them.

820
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,240
Where are they?

821
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,520
Don't land on them.

822
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,920
Your body is stuck.

823
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,120
Fucking land on them, Tempo.

824
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,560
Tempo, do you build walls here so we don't get charged by full-time death?

825
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,340
We're going to kill these guys, Ducky.

826
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,600
We're going to kill them?

827
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,180
Fuck yeah.

828
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm trying to land where you guys are peeing.

829
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,380
I have to bat.

830
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,160
Why am I just going straight down?

831
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,460
I broke the wall.

832
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,140
We bat.

833
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,620
And then I'm going to run up those stairs and tether them and we're going to grip this shit, okay?

834
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,120
Okay, I threw a name.

835
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,500
Jump at it.

836
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,080
Okay, I'm coming over.

837
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,800
If we die, I guess we die.

838
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,600
Nice, nice.

839
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,540
Nice, he's dead.

840
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,500
Oh, there's a whole team!

841
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,240
No, that's our teammate.

842
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,100
Oh, that's his teammate.

843
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,900
Okay, you got this.

844
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,920
I believe in you, Matt.

845
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm resing this.

846
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:18,860
All right.

847
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
What if they res it?

848
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,740
Okay, I'm healing.

849
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,380
I'm healing.

850
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
I'm playing up.

851
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,480
Oh, there's another team!

852
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:29,940
There's another team!

853
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,080
They're not going near.

854
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,620
They're not going near itself.

855
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,540
I killed one.

856
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,180
I killed one.

857
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,400
I dropped down, though.

858
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,580
I'm medkidding.

859
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,080
They're all dead.

860
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,420
They're all dead.

861
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:39,800
Nice.

862
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,840
All right.

863
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,560
There's a Kimbo Mozams.

864
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,480
All right.

865
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,640
Oh, there's a Caustic over there.

866
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,420
Tempo, come here.

867
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Don't come to me.

868
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,600
Don't come to me.

869
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,260
There's another team.

870
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,980
There's a Caustic here.

871
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,700
Wait, I can't get out of here.

872
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,360
Tempo, go through zone.

873
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,100
Go through zone.

874
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,440
You'll be fine.

875
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,000
Trust me.

876
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,260
Doesn't this hurt?

877
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,920
Kind of, but you're fine.

878
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,480
It's just a little bit.

879
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,420
Just a little touch doesn't hurt.

880
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,200
I'm going in as fast as I can.

881
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,040
Just come up here.

882
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,040
This spot up here is really good.

883
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,080
Okay, I'm here.

884
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,860
We're a wall.

885
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,740
Build a fucking castle.

886
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,780
There's a team right here.

887
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,040
There's a team right here.

888
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Look, we can look down at all the peasants, Tempo.

889
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,320
Come here.

890
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:16,940
Look.

891
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,880
Come here, my king.

892
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,300
Build walls.

893
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,980
Look down upon your peasants.

894
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,780
I'm coming over!

895
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,260
I'm alive!

896
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,040
Oh, shit.

897
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,300
Loot.

898
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,580
Nice.

899
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,860
I actually contributed.

900
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,500
Guys, bad news.

901
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,360
Zone bounced off.

902
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,020
Okay.

903
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,580
Wait, you were actually keeping track of that?

904
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,660
Enemy is respawning nearby.

905
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,840
You were actually paying attention?

906
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,800
Bad news.

907
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,260
Bad news bears.

908
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,360
We have shots here.

909
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,560
Tempo, give me a wall.

910
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,140
Tempo, please give me a wall.

911
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,140
Please.

912
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,640
I've been asked for 20 minutes.

913
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,680
This is exactly why I did not want to play Rampart.

914
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,760
We have shots on this.

915
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,300
Alright, charge rifle.

916
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,280
Tempo, stay here.

917
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,720
Clap some ass.

918
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,580
I'm gonna go fuck with the people in this building.

919
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Wait, wait, wait.

920
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,420
We're clapping ass.

921
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,760
What if Tempo dies before we do that?

922
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,020
109.

923
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,300
Tempo won't die.

924
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,260
I'm heading over.

925
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,300
I'm providing you guys with long distance cover fire.

926
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,620
Okay, I am looking.

927
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,720
I got killed.

928
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,140
Yeah, I am.

929
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,840
I knocked one in there.

930
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,780
Yeah, but there's a caustic in there.

931
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm up in 20.

932
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,940
Just keep clapping ass, Tempo.

933
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,120
I'll just wait here.

934
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,680
No pressure, Tempo, but I'm spectating you.

935
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,440
I need you to hit a shot.

936
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,700
Tempo.

937
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,780
Tempo, this is your gun, bro.

938
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,420
They're supposed to stop moving.

939
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,720
This is what your gun you're known for.

940
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,820
Yeah, I thought you were known to be...

941
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,020
I thought you were known for this.

942
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,380
Stop looking.

943
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,520
Performance anxiety.

944
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,260
I got one.

945
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,660
There's a team evacing next to us.

946
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,040
Tempo, shoot them off the evac to your right.

947
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,080
Up to your right.

948
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,780
Where are they?

949
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,100
Where are they?

950
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,500
Where's Ray?

951
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

952
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

953
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,980
We have to get over here.

954
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,860
It's fine.

955
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,460
I'm okay.

956
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,000
We have to brawl, fellas.

957
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,820
We have to brawl.

958
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,560
Oh, no.

959
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,080
I'm moving.

960
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,160
I'm schmoving.

961
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,580
You gotta kill.

962
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,080
You gotta kill.

963
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,360
Play to me.

964
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,680
Play to me.

965
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:14,940
Play to me.

966
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,460
Okay, okay.

967
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,700
I'll be there in 20 years, but okay.

968
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,380
I'm gonna use my little bat boy to come over here.

969
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,000
I have no escape ability now.

970
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,640
One died.

971
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,680
One's dead in the second floor.

972
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,060
Come here.

973
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:26,800
Okay.

974
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,240
Play on me.

975
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,560
Play on me.

976
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,300
Oh, wait.

977
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,720
There's a ram shitter.

978
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,600
I got one, but I'm dead.

979
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,200
I got 40 seconds.

980
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,500
We have to kill this guy when he rounds this corner.

981
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,160
I think.

982
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:38,800
Just chill.

983
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:38,940
Chill.

984
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,040
Chill.

985
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,340
Come here.

986
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:39,680
Come here.

987
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,900
Don't go inside this way.

988
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,940
We're in here.

989
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,400
We're in here.

990
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,060
Just live.

991
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,680
Just live.

992
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,800
This is all you have to do, Mac.

993
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,320
Just live.

994
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,940
Just live.

995
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,060
I'll block everything.

996
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,580
Wait.

997
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,520
Where's my timer?

998
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,040
10 seconds.

999
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,740
10 seconds.

1000
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,180
10 seconds.

1001
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,140
You gotta live for 10 seconds.

1002
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,060
All deaths for now are final.

1003
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,220
So I still get my res, right?

1004
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,960
Yes, you do.

1005
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes, you do.

1006
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,240
Yeah, that's right.

1007
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,080
I got the last res.

1008
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,720
Suck a dick.

1009
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,620
Oh, shit.

1010
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,560
I'm coming back full HP, bitches.

1011
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,560
Oh, shit.

1012
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,200
70 pump.

1013
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,840
He's close.

1014
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,160
He's close.

1015
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,240
Please, Mac.

1016
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,700
He's just healed.

1017
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:16,960
He's healed.

1018
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,480
We're fine.

1019
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,760
This is totally fine.

1020
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,480
Don't panic.

1021
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,460
I don't feel fine.

1022
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm fine.

1023
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,100
If all deaths are final, I should land with you guys, right?

1024
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,780
Yeah, yeah.

1025
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,180
Get in here.

1026
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,740
We're safe in here, Tempo.

1027
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,080
Come on.

1028
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:26,820
Please.

1029
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,960
He needs to be our lifeline.

1030
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,160
He needs to land away from us.

1031
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,180
No, there's no more res in.

1032
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh, there's no more res in.

1033
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,460
Oh, shit.

1034
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:32,680
Okay.

1035
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,440
I'm popping an ulti-excel so we can maybe get out of here.

1036
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,380
Okay, I have another ulti-excel so we can get it for real.

1037
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:37,800
I need to look around.

1038
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,080
There's a team out here.

1039
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,240
Tempo, start building walls.

1040
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,360
I knocked one.

1041
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:42,940
Okay.

1042
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,720
Come here.

1043
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:43,920
Come here.

1044
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,380
We're ulting at that.

1045
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,120
I'm fucking sending us.

1046
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:45,620
Let's go, boys.

1047
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,020
Okay.

1048
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,060
Mark this fucking team.

1049
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:47,500
All right.

1050
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:47,720
All right.

1051
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:47,820
All right.

1052
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,780
I got that team.

1053
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,940
I'm batting.

1054
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,180
I saw you.

1055
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,940
No.

1056
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,800
They pulled you something.

1057
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,380
They pulled you something.

1058
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,340
I got one.

1059
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,260
I got a bitch.

1060
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,940
Can I res you?

1061
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,140
No, no, no, no.

1062
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,700
Just live.

1063
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,860
You're a rat now.

1064
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,440
You're a rat.

1065
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,540
Rat jam.

1066
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,460
You're rat.

1067
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,240
You're ratty.

1068
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,360
No.

1069
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,800
Did you rat?

1070
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,480
It says squad eliminated.

1071
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,280
Are you alive?

1072
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,960
Yo, we got a lot of kills, though.

1073
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,460
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure other people got it.

1074
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,200
You know what?

1075
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm glad we...

1076
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,960
Yo, this team only has four kills.

1077
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,240
Yeah, we had 15.

1078
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,340
Yeah, we had 15.

1079
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,400
There's still so many people still alive.

1080
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,340
There's still so many people still alive.

1081
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,200
Guys, I think, like, me panicking did not help the situation.

1082
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,780
Wait, we got killed by Zap?

1083
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,600
Oh, that's...

1084
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,140
Not a good look.

1085
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,020
That's not a good look on us.

1086
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,580
That's not a good look on us.

1087
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,060
It's okay.

1088
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,880
We'll probably have more kill points than on this game.

1089
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,240
That's true.

1090
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,680
That's true.

1091
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,380
We'll probably be better than Zap.

1092
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,460
I think we got a lot of kills.

1093
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,140
Yeah, yeah.

1094
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,380
Honestly, we wiped a couple...

1095
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,700
This team only has...

1096
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,680
The team I'm spectating only has five kills.

1097
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,940
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure we got, like...

1098
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,640
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure we got, like...

1099
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm pretty sure we got, like...

1100
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,000
We wiped three teams there, so...

1101
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,960
No, we got 15 kills.

1102
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,200
Wait, we got 15?

1103
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,340
There's no fucking way.

1104
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,980
Did we actually?

1105
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,120
Holy shit, we're gamers.

1106
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,740
Gamers.

1107
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,040
Yeah.

1108
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,900
Oh my god, we are.

1109
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,620
Even this new team?

1110
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,080
Even the new team I'm spectating?

1111
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,460
They only have six kills.

1112
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh my god.

1113
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,160
Yeah, they were playing zones like pussies.

1114
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,840
Yeah, that's right.

1115
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,980
Oh, it's Vax's team.

1116
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,020
Vax's team, you pussies.

1117
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,900
Yeah, you pussies.

1118
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,760
You can literally aim.

1119
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,660
What are you doing?

1120
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,420
Like...

1121
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
You can literally be shooting people.

1122
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,120
Yeah.

1123
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,000
How do you even see a leaderboard in this?

1124
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,240
If there's specific guns that you get extra points?

1125
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,200
That's true.

1126
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,440
How do you know if they have boosts?

1127
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,540
I guess you have to report it.

1128
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
And be like, I killed this amount of people.

1129
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,420
Oh my god.

1130
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,460
With this gun.

1131
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,620
With this gun, yeah.

1132
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,700
You guys just have to trust me.

1133
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,520
I got 13 kills, all with the exact gun I needed.

1134
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,420
Every single one of my kills?

1135
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,140
Yeah, they were bonus boards.

1136
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,980
All those 15 kills I got?

1137
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,660
Boosted loader, right there.

1138
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,440
Oh, what a caustic.

1139
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,720
Oh, shit.

1140
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,160
Oh, and he couldn't go back in.

1141
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,160
There's still six squads still alive.

1142
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,140
There's still six squads still alive.

1143
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh my god.

1144
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,780
How many kills does this team have?

1145
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,920
3, 5, and 7.

1146
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,240
So they have the same amount of kills as us.

1147
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,380
So they have the same amount of kills as us.

1148
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,560
Okay, this team shouldn't be legal.

1149
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,780
Wait, who is this team?

1150
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,020
Giggle, doll, and madness.

1151
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,080
Giggle, doll, and madness.

1152
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,600
Giggle, doll, and madness?

1153
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,560
Okay, never mind.

1154
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,660
It's perfectly fine.

1155
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,200
Oh my god.

1156
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,160
Why didn't we have a caustic?

1157
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,180
Character stinks.

1158
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,120
Mac, everybody else has caustic.

1159
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,060
I heard there's a bug with caustic where you can have infinite traps.

1160
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:05,940
I heard there's a bug with caustic where you can have infinite traps.

1161
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,300
Wait, what?

1162
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,400
What?

1163
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,400
Yeah, because you can pick up his traps from far away now.

1164
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:10,840
Oh, shit.

1165
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,080
It's like if you pick one up from far away and throw one at the same time, it just doesn't go on cooldown.

1166
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,020
Wait, that's fucking broken.

1167
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,440
So why didn't we play caustic?

1168
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,360
Why didn't we exploit it?

1169
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,180
Why didn't we abuse it?

1170
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,720
It sounds very appealing.

1171
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,000
So why didn't we play it?

1172
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,100
I don't understand.

1173
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,120
Alright, well now we...

1174
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,060
Okay, they're doing new...

1175
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,320
Guys, we can't play that because they're doing new characters now, new legends now after this.

1176
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,880
So...

1177
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,360
Oh, this is a normal game.

1178
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,780
This is a normal game?

1179
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,060
What does that mean?

1180
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,440
This is a normal game, not revival.

1181
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,840
Yeah, the next one.

1182
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,080
The next one is a normal game.

1183
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1184
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,620
What am I playing?

1185
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,400
Is that how...

1186
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,360
Is that how...

1187
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,320
Who's mic did that come from?

1188
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,660
Oh, Stumpo.

1189
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,820
Yes, that is him.

1190
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,660
Yes, that is him.

1191
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,940
Wait, you're roommates with Hal now?

1192
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,260
Yep.

1193
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,060
What am I playing in the background?

1194
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,440
Was he second place?

1195
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,820
Was he second place?

1196
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Wait, didn't he get second?

1197
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,220
Yeah, I literally heard that one.

1198
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,540
It was second place.

1199
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,920
No, it wasn't even...

1200
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,200
Wait, no, team one is...

1201
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,920
Wait, no, he won!

1202
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,420
We had the second most kills.

1203
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,620
They won!

1204
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,280
What was the howling?

1205
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,160
We were cooking.

1206
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,180
Oh, I guess that was a good, what am I playing?

1207
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,600
Yes, that is good.

1208
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,200
What am I playing?

1209
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,360
Is he giving himself a pat in the back right there?

1210
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,540
Holy shit.

1211
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,760
Wait, when did you...

1212
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,440
Why does everyone have such little kills?

1213
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,640
Because everybody is just chilling.

1214
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,660
That's right.

1215
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,460
Good call, Mac.

1216
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,280
We just keep killing everyone while everyone plays scared.

1217
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:10,660
We just keep killing everyone while everyone plays scared.

1218
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,600
What do you mean good call, Mac?

1219
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,480
I was the one that came up with the strat!

1220
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,940
You gave your captain spot up!

1221
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,740
I gave the strat!

1222
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,060
I gave my spot away!

1223
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,620
Fuse, Horizon, Octane, Valk, Blood, Cat, Conduit, Lifeline.

1224
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,240
Okay.

1225
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,740
Play, Mac.

1226
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,880
Okay, so it's not a respawn one.

1227
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,460
Yeah, so it's a normal game.

1228
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,800
So do we want to go support?

1229
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,340
So we can do respawning?

1230
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,040
No.

1231
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,840
We just farm respawn peeking.

1232
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,100
I'm thinking we play Fuse?

1233
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,520
Yeah, baby!

1234
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,540
I'm gonna go Fuse!

1235
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,720
Okay.

1236
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,660
And then what do I play?

1237
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,140
Uh...

1238
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,020
Maybe Valk?

1239
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,460
Okay, what do I play?

1240
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,120
Uh...

1241
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,060
Probably Valk if we play that comp.

1242
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,840
Okay, so what do I play?

1243
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,880
What do you want to play?

1244
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,240
She wants Octane.

1245
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,580
As long as it's...

1246
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't know how to play Valk!

1247
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,280
That's literally the only character I don't know how to play!

1248
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,820
I don't play Valk because all my other teammates usually play Valk.

1249
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,340
Okay.

1250
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,420
I don't know how to play Valk.

1251
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:30,760
Okay, okay.

1252
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,820
Do you play Cat?

1253
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,160
Yeah, I can play Cat.

1254
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,520
Okay, play Cat and then...

1255
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,880
Wait, we can't play Fuse with Cat.

1256
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,040
Oh, that's fine.

1257
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,440
Actually, we don't need Fuse because we're not gonna Fuse tech people.

1258
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,420
Because Bang isn't picked.

1259
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,760
No, no, you know what?

1260
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
Do you trust me on Valk?

1261
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,260
What is the Fuse tech?

1262
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,340
Are you fucking...

1263
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,240
I was like, what are we using because of Fuse?

1264
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,600
I was like, what are we using because of Fuse?

1265
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,380
No, but do you trust me on Valk?

1266
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,420
Because I can try.

1267
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,180
What?

1268
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,900
I could learn like right now.

1269
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm gonna have to go ahead and say no as well.

1270
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,500
I can literally learn right now.

1271
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,360
She's gonna fly us and we're gonna get stuck in a mountain and then we're gonna die.

1272
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,120
Just fucking leave!

1273
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,840
Just detach from me!

1274
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,720
You don't have to be attached to me!

1275
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,740
No, no, no.

1276
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,100
So, we'll play...

1277
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,900
I'll play Valk and then we'll put Tempo on Lifeline.

1278
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,720
Oh, I can be Lifeline.

1279
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1280
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,960
And then we'll put you on Catalyst.

1281
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,440
Okay.

1282
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,400
Alright, that sounds good.

1283
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,240
That sounds good.

1284
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,460
I mean like, literally the whole...

1285
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,500
Actually, I'm gonna play Horizon instead of Valk.

1286
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,320
What is a Lifeline blending skin?

1287
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,600
Because it'll kill people.

1288
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,300
Oh, okay.

1289
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,540
Okay, but we don't have revival anymore.

1290
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,560
Wait, Horizon just got removed.

1291
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,140
God damn, they just removed Horizon from the list.

1292
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,240
Why did they remove Horizon?

1293
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,080
Oh, she has bugs in customs right now.

1294
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,040
Oh, what kind of bugs?

1295
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,060
You're horizontal and then the server gets sucked into the black hole.

1296
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:56,940
Wait, what?

1297
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,180
Yeah, yeah.

1298
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,060
The server, you know what I mean?

1299
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,680
Like the server poofs, it just vanishes.

1300
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,400
Oh, it like destroys itself?

1301
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,380
I thought you meant every player in the game gets sucked into the black hole.

1302
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,620
Wait, that's fucked.

1303
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,060
That's pretty cool.

1304
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,360
Yeah, we were trying to play LCQ scrims.

1305
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,880
And the whole server would just go offline.

1306
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,840
There's just one Horizon ult and it pulls everyone in the map into one thing.

1307
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,820
It's like a little black hole.

1308
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,280
It just gets someone being ripped open from big mod all the way to stacks for some reason.

1309
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,600
Yeah.

1310
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,380
Alright, I have swapped to Lifeline.

1311
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,500
Okay, I'll swap.

1312
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,480
It's probably just Valk.

1313
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,600
Wait, they gave us a new...

1314
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,400
Oh, that is the new list, okay.

1315
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah.

1316
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,720
Okay, I think I'll just play Valk.

1317
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,260
Okay.

1318
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,520
And I'm Kat.

1319
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,620
I'm Katatis, right?

1320
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:48,860
Yeah.

1321
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,540
Okay.

1322
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,920
Alright, where's the leaderboard?

1323
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,340
I think you guys are cowards for not letting me play Valk.

1324
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,540
Oh, okay.

1325
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,780
That's okay.

1326
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,360
I'll take being called a coward instead of dying to OOB.

1327
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,200
Yeah.

1328
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,120
I don't know if I...

1329
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,620
I just don't know if I can trust you to be a pilot.

1330
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,240
You know what I mean?

1331
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,380
Guys, look, I can fly near and straight into a wall.

1332
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,740
Guys, okay, we can't fly.

1333
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,420
All I have to do is go up and you guys just detach from me.

1334
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:14,540
All I have to do is go up and you guys just detach from me.

1335
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,720
That's all you have to do.

1336
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,900
But what if there's a mountain in the way?

1337
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,960
She's gonna fly right into the mountain and be like, uh oh.

1338
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,320
Okay, if I fly into the mountain, it's your fault.

1339
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,940
It's your fault for not guiding me better.

1340
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,260
It's the captain's fault for not guiding me.

1341
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,320
Not good.

1342
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,320
So the captain should fly...

1343
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,960
Well, the captain should tell me not to fly straight to the mountain.

1344
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,660
You would think.

1345
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,020
You would think everyone would know that.

1346
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,220
I am a co-pilot.

1347
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,780
You're the pilot.

1348
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,820
Ah, I see.

1349
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,780
Yeah, you already saw me panic last game.

1350
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,640
You think I'm gonna do better on Valk?

1351
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,900
No.

1352
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,920
If you trust... Okay, you're right.

1353
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,740
That was the whole argument.

1354
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,940
Yeah, that's the whole point.

1355
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,940
That's the whole point.

1356
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,660
But it's because you guys don't believe in me enough.

1357
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,740
And that's why.

1358
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,940
I had a lot of faith in you last game, but you were panicking.

1359
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,940
So I'm not so sure that that was the problem.

1360
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,720
Sorry, I forgot the argument midway.

1361
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,180
I was up since 7am.

1362
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,560
I forgot the argument already.

1363
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,900
You were forgetting the arguments midway the same way you're forgetting the directions midway through the flight.

1364
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,320
You were like, alright, just don't fly into that fucking mountain.

1365
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,220
You'll be like, hmm?

1366
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,440
He he.

1367
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,460
He he he.

1368
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,980
I said they put us on a mountain.

1369
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,320
Oopsies.

1370
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,120
Alright, don't worry.

1371
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
I believe in this new comp.

1372
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,440
Alright, wait.

1373
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,340
Spitfire-ry is the extra kill gun.

1374
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,060
Oh, is it Spitfire?

1375
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,720
I mean, Spitfire's a nice gun.

1376
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,940
Spitfire charge rifle.

1377
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:57,960
Alright.

1378
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,640
That's the fucking worst gun combo, but okay.

1379
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,500
Wait, can you double-ry?

1380
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,060
No, no, it's only P20, right?

1381
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,980
If you got a Kimbo-ry, that shit would kill so fast.

1382
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,800
Oh yeah, I guess so.

1383
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,180
Imagine a Kimbo-rys with hammer points.

1384
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,060
Oh, true.

1385
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,160
Double -ry John Wick.

1386
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,040
You should put that in instead of P20.

1387
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,100
Where's the leaderboard at?

1388
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,400
Do they have a leaderboard out?

1389
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,560
Exclamation mark now.

1390
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,760
You're the leaderboard guy.

1391
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,360
With you playing, no one's making it.

1392
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:29,420
What the fuck?

1393
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,580
You're right.

1394
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,500
You should be the one making the leaderboard for us.

1395
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,780
Oh wait, I said we were going dome, and dome is a bonus point, POI.

1396
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,160
Oh no.

1397
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,860
We're gonna get contested.

1398
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,560
That's okay.

1399
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,680
I am very petty.

1400
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:48,880
If someone lands on dome on us, I am down to land on them every single game so that they get dead last.

1401
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,360
No, just ban them from scrims.

1402
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,980
Well, that's not enough.

1403
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,100
That's not enough, but you will do it, right?

1404
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1405
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:58,760
Really?

1406
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,760
Or are you just being a little bitch?

1407
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,900
I said in all caps of the JobSpot channel, we call dome, making it known if we are conned, we will con you the rest of this tournament.

1408
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,560
And the rest of Twitch rivals, and for all scrims, everywhere you will be contested.

1409
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,140
Damn.

1410
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,580
For the rest of your lives.

1411
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,080
Wait, hey, remember to add, nTemple's gonna ban you from scrims.

1412
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,680
Remember to add that in.

1413
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,720
Like, I need that in writing.

1414
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,440
That has to be in writing.

1415
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,920
Okay, uh...

1416
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,550
Oh my god, are you actually writing that?

1417
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,250
No, no, no.

1418
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,390
I was...

1419
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,930
I was curious...

1420
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,030
where the scores lined up.

1421
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,650
I like how the person below you was like, we call Neon and dome first though.

1422
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,770
And then I just wrote, no you didn't.

1423
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,230
No you didn't.

1424
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:18,710
He just wrote, no you didn't.

1425
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,750
Wait, what team number are we?

1426
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:25,090
Eight?

1427
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:27,310
Sort?

1428
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:28,270
Team?

1429
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,690
Oh, we are tied for third place with 16 points.

1430
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,510
Wait, what?

1431
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,290
That's crazy.

1432
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,910
Wait, we got one placement point?

1433
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,150
We had 15 kills.

1434
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,510
We got 13th place, Matt.

1435
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,450
Oh wait, did we?

1436
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,590
Yeah, we got one placement point, what the fuck?

1437
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,830
I didn't realize it was like that.

1438
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,450
I think of course we got one point.

1439
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,990
I felt like we did really good there.

1440
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,290
We did, killing people.

1441
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,010
If we got...

1442
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:05,810
First has 22 points, and then second has 17, and then us and Hal's team has 16.

1443
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,390
Wait, but Hal's team won first, and they still got tied with us.

1444
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,310
Guys, we're just as good as Hal.

1445
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,150
So it's like we got first.

1446
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,610
Yeah, it's like we got...

1447
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,710
It's like we got first in the World Cup!

1448
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:17,970
Someone got minus five.

1449
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,490
Someone got minus five.

1450
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:20,810
Get fucked.

1451
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,790
Oh my god, it's like we're first in the World Cup, guys.

1452
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,010
Oh, come on.

1453
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,150
Yeah, baby.

1454
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:27,990
No, this is good.

1455
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:28,430
Oh, wait.

1456
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:29,810
Who got minus five last game?

1457
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,370
Timmy's team?

1458
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:30,790
Yeah.

1459
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:31,570
Was it minus ten?

1460
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,070
Wait, who got minus five on this team?

1461
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,650
I gotta add some negative fives to my chart.

1462
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,210
He just can't break his habits of keeping track of scores, man.

1463
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,910
I just like to negative five people.

1464
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,230
And he said he was off the clock.

1465
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,890
He's like, I'm off the clock.

1466
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,070
He's like, ooh, stats right now.

1467
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,050
Stats, stats, stats.

1468
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,070
Who fucked up?

1469
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,690
Who got minus five?

1470
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,010
Team five got a minus five last time.

1471
00:49:59,210 --> 00:49:59,690
Team five got a minus five last time.

1472
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:00,270
Who's team five?

1473
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,490
Timmy's team.

1474
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,250
And we killed Timmy's team, too.

1475
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,210
Oh my god, Timmy's team is at negative four points.

1476
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,270
Oh my god, Timmy's team is at negative four points.

1477
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:10,570
Wait, wait, wait.

1478
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,470
Who fucked up this game?

1479
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,090
Oh my god, was it Timmy again?

1480
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,210
Wait, was it?

1481
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:18,990
Fuse, Octane, Blood.

1482
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,110
Are those not legends?

1483
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,330
Fuse, Octane, Blood are legends.

1484
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:24,950
You know what?

1485
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,590
That might be actually a good comp to play from dome low key.

1486
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,910
So, who fucked up?

1487
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,670
I'm confused.

1488
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:32,870
Who fucked up?

1489
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,150
Everything looks right.

1490
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:35,930
Right?

1491
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,370
Yeah, I'm just wondering who fucked up.

1492
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,090
I have the rule.

1493
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,490
You ain't gonna reinforce it.

1494
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:43,970
I lied.

1495
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,970
Wait, who fucked up?

1496
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,510
I don't see anyone that messed up here.

1497
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,910
We're changing comps.

1498
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,210
I lied.

1499
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:51,290
Wait, why?

1500
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,190
You play Blood on.

1501
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,650
I play Bloodhound.

1502
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:55,810
Why are we changing comps?

1503
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,470
Because we're gonna fuck dudes.

1504
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,190
We're coming in.

1505
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,950
We're playing dome.

1506
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,110
We might be conned because of this thing.

1507
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,650
I think we just fuck some dudes.

1508
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,390
We're ready for the con and then we can roll out of dome.

1509
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,390
Okay, I'm down.

1510
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,390
Okay, I'm down.

1511
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,550
But I need to know, who gets negative five?

1512
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,390
I need to make sure they get their negative five.

1513
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,250
It doesn't look like anybody is taking a negative here.

1514
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:18,730
Oh, Watson, team fifteen.

1515
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:19,870
Team fifteen?

1516
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:20,850
No.

1517
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:23,790
It's team fifteen.

1518
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,430
Was it surefour?

1519
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,930
There we go.

1520
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,750
Was it surefour that fucked up?

1521
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:39,130
Team fifteen and team five are both at negative four points right now because they only got one last game and now they both have a negative five.

1522
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,150
Oh my god.

1523
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,570
Negative points, suckers.

1524
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,170
Oh my god.

1525
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,170
Oh my god, surefour's chat is like minus five.

1526
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,670
XD Damn.

1527
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,870
I'm gonna miss.

1528
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,290
I'm gonna miss this surefour.

1529
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,010
Team fifteen, Watson.

1530
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,530
Damn.

1531
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,970
Alright, I need to pick twos.

1532
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:06,970
Damn.

1533
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,490
Imagine you finish the tournament, negative points.

1534
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,790
That would be fucked.

1535
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,750
That would be actually fucked.

1536
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,430
That would be funny.

1537
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,170
I'm gonna set a record at that point.

1538
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,050
Fuse, where's fuse?

1539
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:22,910
Top left.

1540
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,870
Oh there he is, okay.

1541
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,710
Me being first pick was scary.

1542
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,010
You guys know how to tap strafe, right?

1543
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:30,590
Yeah!

1544
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:31,730
What?

1545
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,390
Tempo?

1546
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,270
You need to lock in, Tempo.

1547
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:44,170
We're gonna go to tap strafe, pat on someone to take height, and Tempo's gonna end up in East Africa.

1548
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,750
I'll just go straight and then run towards you guys.

1549
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:50,510
Okay.

1550
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't worry.

1551
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,750
I believe in you, Tempo.

1552
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,930
Don't worry, we got this.

1553
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,270
It's okay, it's okay.

1554
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,490
We're gonna learn today.

1555
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,430
Tempo's gonna learn today how to tap strafe.

1556
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:02,290
We're gonna teach him now.

1557
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,670
We're going dumb.

1558
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,690
Is there anyone right beside us?

1559
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,590
We're getting caught?

1560
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,590
Get ready to get banned from scrims, Zap.

1561
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,050
Is it Zap that's conning us?

1562
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,450
If it is, he's getting banned from scrims.

1563
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,550
That's fucked because he killed us last game.

1564
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,230
That's so fucked.

1565
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,130
Purple team is landing launch site.

1566
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,410
Do we have a team next to us?

1567
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,550
No, we don't.

1568
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,850
Wait, does that mean we get bonus points if we land here?

1569
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,210
Yeah, yeah, we do.

1570
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,690
Oh my god!

1571
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,370
We get bonus points for not doing anything!

1572
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,090
My gaslighting worked!

1573
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,870
But I said, no you didn't.

1574
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,130
Wait, someone's shooting a triple take somewhere.

1575
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:42,770
Oh my god.

1576
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,250
You saw that?

1577
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:43,970
She's just like, oh.

1578
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,530
You're right.

1579
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:46,590
I didn't claim dome.

1580
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,310
Holy shit, it worked.

1581
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:50,810
What do you mean?

1582
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,130
I didn't think it would work.

1583
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,590
I have a purple...

1584
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,090
I have a gold heavy mag for someone.

1585
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,130
I need a mastiff and I need a gun shield.

1586
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,630
Ooh, hey, look at what I got for you.

1587
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,330
It's your birthday.

1588
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:04,830
Excellent.

1589
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,050
I have a hemlock for you.

1590
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,090
I have one.

1591
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,630
Yeah, we all have one.

1592
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,410
Oh wait, it's a spitfire!

1593
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,550
Oh, okay.

1594
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,530
I mean, that's fine.

1595
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,030
But should we give spitfire to...

1596
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,450
to Mack?

1597
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:18,770
Probably.

1598
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,630
Yeah, because he's the one that's going to be farming the kills for us.

1599
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,630
Someone take that.

1600
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,370
Oh, there's another one here.

1601
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,530
Oh wait, why do I have a triple take?

1602
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,370
I thought...

1603
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,190
Oh wait, that wasn't a nemesis.

1604
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,490
I'm so dumb.

1605
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,870
They could get fast pushed by launch site.

1606
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:36,990
That's not good.

1607
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,010
Yeah, they probably won't.

1608
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:40,790
But like, you know.

1609
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,910
Yeah, but they could, yeah.

1610
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,870
Wait, did you give the spitfire to Mack yet?

1611
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,750
No, I didn't.

1612
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,510
Is there a spitfire anywhere?

1613
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,550
Yeah, right here.

1614
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,690
I'm going to drop it on top of the gun thingamajig.

1615
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,330
I'm going to scan the thing.

1616
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,870
I'm going to scan the ring.

1617
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,470
Not ring, sorry, the people.

1618
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:58,930
Alright.

1619
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,250
Oh wait, you need to drop me ammo.

1620
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,270
You don't need ammo.

1621
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,170
I just have fuse cues.

1622
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,690
That's all you need.

1623
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,210
Oh wait, that's you scanning, okay.

1624
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,490
Can you grab that assault gun?

1625
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,490
We're all just chilling.

1626
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:13,390
Oh, all the way, okay.

1627
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,290
Wait, there's one guy, wait.

1628
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,950
No, yeah, there's these two teams here.

1629
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,610
They're fighting each other.

1630
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,250
Ping me a charge rifle.

1631
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,250
I think we looted everything.

1632
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,790
Alright Mack, what are we going to do?

1633
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,710
I need shotgun ammo.

1634
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,810
Craft some bats.

1635
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,790
Yeah, I can give you some.

1636
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,730
I have two shield cells, what the fuck, I am broke.

1637
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,410
Go craft a bat.

1638
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,970
Yay, how many points do we get, Mack?

1639
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,070
We're landing here.

1640
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,430
One.

1641
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,830
Yeah.

1642
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,230
It's just a freebie.

1643
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,890
Wait, do you already have your mastiff?

1644
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:50,010
Yeah, I need a shotgun bolt though.

1645
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,070
No, I don't have that.

1646
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,510
Is there a shotty bolt back there?

1647
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,510
Nope, I didn't see any.

1648
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,970
Let's get moving out of here.

1649
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,750
Yo, I just picked up a 4-10.

1650
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:01,650
Whoa, that's for your future.

1651
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,550
But I don't have a charge rifle.

1652
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,790
There's a charge rifle right here.

1653
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,470
Oh, yes.

1654
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,390
4-10 charge rifle.

1655
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,010
I'm going to go grab this.

1656
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,190
Make people angry.

1657
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,270
Should I get Raven's Blessing or Odin's Glare?

1658
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,190
The scan.

1659
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:21,710
The double scan duration.

1660
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,490
Okay, Odin's Glare.

1661
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,090
Alright.

1662
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,690
I just noticed different people like different things.

1663
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,450
I'm in this building, I don't see a charge rifle.

1664
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,390
It's in there somewhere.

1665
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,170
It's not very helpful.

1666
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:37,170
In this building?

1667
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,270
Yeah, can you also hit the rune console?

1668
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,150
Again?

1669
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,110
It should be in here.

1670
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,390
He never hit it.

1671
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,890
It was in the other one.

1672
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,870
Just hit the rune console.

1673
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,290
Yeah, we shouldn't waste your time.

1674
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,330
We're chilling.

1675
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,030
Playing slow.

1676
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,130
Don't pull to us.

1677
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:00,190
I don't think it's going to pull to us.

1678
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,210
Okay, we're good.

1679
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,830
We're next to it though.

1680
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:04,870
Yeah, yeah.

1681
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,430
We should start moving back here.

1682
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,770
Alright, I'm heading over.

1683
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,670
Where's the charge rifle?

1684
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,590
You'll never have one, I guess.

1685
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,750
It was in here.

1686
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,350
Are you sure?

1687
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,750
Are you sure?

1688
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,050
Did no one want this gold heavy?

1689
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,370
Oh, so he's just blind.

1690
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,150
There we go.

1691
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,010
Did no one want that gold heavy?

1692
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,330
No, I don't need it.

1693
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,430
Grab your charge rifle and then we gotta start fucking schmoving, gentlemen.

1694
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,530
Oh, I'm rich, bitch.

1695
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:35,430
I'm heading over.

1696
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,010
I don't think there's anyone back here.

1697
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,210
Alright, I'm heading over.

1698
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:41,070
I'm heading from the back.

1699
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,010
A guy just jumped off the height there.

1700
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:47,490
That's scary.

1701
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,210
Nah, we're chilling.

1702
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,590
He just zipped back up.

1703
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,590
You know, things could get a little sketchy.

1704
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:57,150
Yeah, because we're sort of like a killing comp.

1705
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,970
But I don't think we're going to be doing much killing.

1706
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:02,070
But I don't think we're going to be doing much killing.

1707
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,350
We might, we might.

1708
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:05,990
Alright.

1709
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:06,830
We need more nades.

1710
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,130
Oh, we can listen to Hal's comms, too.

1711
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,850
Can you open your door, Tempo?

1712
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,510
Both doors are open.

1713
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,370
Let's see what Hugh thinks right now.

1714
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:18,310
Let's see what Hugh thinks right now.

1715
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,370
Alright, we're going to just negative rotate, actually.

1716
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,590
We're just going to go back, hit that UAV, and then we'll get ring three.

1717
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,770
Because there's people at that back building.

1718
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:25,110
Because there's people at that back building.

1719
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:25,370
Okay.

1720
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,650
It's just dying immediately.

1721
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,270
Oh wait, there's another... Oh wait, never mind.

1722
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,470
No, I just didn't know why.

1723
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,570
Right, right, right.

1724
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,190
Ooh, you can open that bin for us.

1725
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:39,930
That's what I just said.

1726
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:40,810
No, we just went over that.

1727
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,130
We just went over this.

1728
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,550
One second ago.

1729
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:46,970
She's in La La Land.

1730
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:51,930
Sorry, I tuned you guys out and tuned back in.

1731
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,270
It's like a radio.

1732
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,110
There's a team crafting here.

1733
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,750
We can maybe kill them.

1734
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,750
A team is crafting?

1735
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,590
Yeah, they're right here.

1736
00:58:58,650 --> 00:58:59,470
In the middle, free kill!

1737
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,510
I'm trying to...

1738
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,030
Are they?

1739
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,470
He's in the middle, right here.

1740
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:06,130
I'm hitting him.

1741
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,550
Flash, flash!

1742
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,050
Cracked one!

1743
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:11,770
He's running.

1744
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:13,470
I'm shield selling.

1745
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:14,790
They're going inside.

1746
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:15,370
No!

1747
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:19,530
We can kill this.

1748
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:20,350
Okay.

1749
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,210
I'm walking up on the left.

1750
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:24,610
Walking up right.

1751
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:25,730
Going middle.

1752
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,810
They're not there, but not close to me.

1753
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,910
I don't know which direction they are.

1754
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,150
One's on my side.

1755
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:35,590
One's on roof.

1756
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,650
On roof!

1757
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:37,210
Help!

1758
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:39,630
I'm heading over.

1759
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,970
I'm on roof now.

1760
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,310
There's another guy back here.

1761
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,070
Take the kill and go southwest.

1762
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,890
I might be dead.

1763
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,190
I'm getting shot at.

1764
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:50,970
I'm batting.

1765
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:53,530
Can we walk away this way?

1766
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,570
I'm batting right now.

1767
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,150
I'm heading back now.

1768
00:59:58,850 --> 00:59:59,670
I'm shooting for you.

1769
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:00,130
You're good.

1770
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:00,990
You're good.

1771
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,730
I'm batting again.

1772
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,430
I got shot from...

1773
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,930
Is that a different team?

1774
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,930
I got shot from back.

1775
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,390
Can you crawl up here?

1776
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,650
I might be dead.

1777
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,970
I might be dead, boys.

1778
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,450
I'm slowly dying.

1779
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:24,770
I don't see them.

1780
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,310
I'm going to rest.

1781
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,410
I am the beta test.

1782
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,370
The scouter.

1783
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:31,150
You're okay.

1784
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:35,710
Are you fucking kidding me?

1785
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,230
Literally at the edge.

1786
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:38,550
I'm watching.

1787
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,670
Just pop a fucking...

1788
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,350
Take my armor.

1789
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,450
Are you...

1790
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,370
Take my armor.

1791
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:47,370
I am not having a good day.

1792
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,030
We're going to go this way, okay?

1793
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,050
We have to go this way.

1794
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:53,650
Oh, wait.

1795
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:54,250
I have no...

1796
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,070
Shield meds.

1797
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,830
I can drop you some if I live.

1798
01:00:59,410 --> 01:00:59,970
Come here.

1799
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:00,130
Come here.

1800
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:00,290
Come here.

1801
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,290
We're going to pad over here.

1802
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:03,350
Drop some.

1803
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,330
Slide into it.

1804
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,110
Tempo, please live because I gave you my shields.

1805
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,170
Oh, I just died.

1806
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,810
Are you resable?

1807
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,770
I'm safe now, yeah.

1808
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,010
Okay, I'll get him.

1809
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:19,690
Just keep an eye on dome, Doki.

1810
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,330
I am looking at dome.

1811
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,290
Oh, I'm going to die to this fucking fuse cube bullshit.

1812
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,690
Nope, I'm good.

1813
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,770
I'm going to look for you guys.

1814
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,300
I'm going to drop you my armor, Tempo.

1815
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:33,980
Okay.

1816
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,540
They're looking at me, I think.

1817
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:37,960
Take my armor.

1818
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,360
Take my armor.

1819
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:41,620
Okay, goodbye.

1820
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
We have to hide, Doki.

1821
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:44,740
Okay.

1822
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:47,700
I don't...

1823
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,000
You have to hide.

1824
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,940
You have to hide.

1825
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,320
I got shot from this side.

1826
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,660
I'm glad we got that one point though.

1827
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,560
Goodbye.

1828
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,060
You got this, I believe.

1829
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,460
I believe.

1830
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:10,090
They're getting ran at, but then they're running at you too.

1831
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:10,490
No!

1832
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,930
Hey guys, not last though.

1833
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,810
Nice try, nice try.

1834
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:15,070
Damn.

1835
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,950
I lost my gold charge rifle.

1836
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,030
Bro, everybody... What the fuck?

1837
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,970
That was two catalyst ults.

1838
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,190
I think we might need to play defensive on the normal games.

1839
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,130
I think we might need to play defensive on the normal games.

1840
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:33,550
I think we might need to play defensive on the normal games.

1841
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,090
Oh my god.

1842
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,590
Wait, what was that beep... Oh, the bins.

1843
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:37,910
Yeah, it's the bins.

1844
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:38,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1845
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,170
Maybe we should have just killed that team in the building.

1846
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:42,630
Maybe we should have just killed that team in the building.

1847
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,510
Did we get thirded there?

1848
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,130
Yeah, there was another team on the east side of the dome that I shot at.

1849
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:47,470
Yeah.

1850
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,290
There was three teams.

1851
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:55,090
There was the team inside dome, the team inside launch, and then the team that walked out from that hill.

1852
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,850
Oh, I see.

1853
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,390
Hey, we got two points though, at least.

1854
01:02:59,470 --> 01:02:59,670
Hey, we got two points though, at least.

1855
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,110
Wait, did we get two kills?

1856
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,490
No, we got one kill, and then we got the free point for landing in dome.

1857
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:06,490
Oh, the free point.

1858
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,010
I was like, where did we get two?

1859
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:10,950
The free point.

1860
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,190
It goes far.

1861
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,050
What the fuck is good kitten?

1862
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:17,770
Ooh, ooh.

1863
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:18,970
You see that?

1864
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,430
Are you guys spectating the same people I am?

1865
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:24,230
No.

1866
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,190
I got Emi.

1867
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:27,970
Design.

1868
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,850
I have... And someone else.

1869
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,130
Perfect lioness.

1870
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,470
And... I don't know.

1871
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,030
Wait, how did we die to this team?

1872
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,210
What the fuck?

1873
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:41,830
We all died from different people.

1874
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,670
Because I died from this team.

1875
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,890
And then Mac died from another team.

1876
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,770
Wait, who are you spectating, Mac?

1877
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,350
I'm watching Design's team.

1878
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,590
Yeah, I'm watching Design as well.

1879
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:54,750
Oh, okay, so you two died to Design.

1880
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,670
I died to this team.

1881
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,190
How did you...

1882
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,770
How did they not fight each other?

1883
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:00,710
But they fought us.

1884
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,810
This is like...

1885
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,350
This is like targeted.

1886
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:07,670
Alright.

1887
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,630
I need to use the bathroom too.

1888
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:13,210
Mac, can you entertain my chat?

1889
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:15,710
As what?

1890
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,550
Can you entertain him?

1891
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,610
Alright, I'll be right back.

1892
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,900
I was debating just staying completely dead silent and then gaslighting.

1893
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,800
I told an amazing story while she was gone.

1894
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,940
But I don't think chat would have gone along with it.

1895
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:15,980
Wait, what?

1896
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,100
Chat would do what?

1897
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,260
Alright.

1898
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,100
Game plan.

1899
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,080
Alright.

1900
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,720
On the regular maps, yeah, we play defensive.

1901
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,680
And then on E-district, because we have Mac, we know things more than everyone else.

1902
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,660
Which means we can bully people.

1903
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,120
And then we just farm kills like we did game one.

1904
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:45,500
So we get all our kill points on E-district and then we get all our placement points on regular.

1905
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,900
And then we get first.

1906
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,060
That sounds like a plan to me.

1907
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,700
Yeah, that's what I thought we were doing.

1908
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,800
That's why I was surprised we were getting a kill.

1909
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:56,480
Perfect.

1910
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,260
Wait, I missed a story?

1911
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,440
What story did you tell?

1912
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,440
I just had to be there.

1913
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,940
Sounds like this is the most entertaining we got in years by Mac.

1914
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,760
Thank you, Mac.

1915
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,300
You're welcome.

1916
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,600
I'm glad I could give your stream the best content they've had in years.

1917
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,160
I just had to be there.

1918
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,320
It's okay, that's why we have VODs, right guys?

1919
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:23,580
I'm going to look back at the VOD and I'm going to see the best story I've ever heard from Mac.

1920
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,280
100%.

1921
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,360
Landing Dome doubled your score.

1922
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,220
Damn.

1923
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,360
From one to two.

1924
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,640
I'm saying it doubled the one point that we got.

1925
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,340
Oh, okay.

1926
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,820
We should have really just...

1927
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:41,640
Do you see this Valk who's about to die to OOP?

1928
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,300
Oh, never mind.

1929
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,340
I was going to say this was you.

1930
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,440
I'm not even spectating the same team.

1931
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,040
Valk almost died to OOP.

1932
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,220
Damn.

1933
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,020
Okay, I'm spectating your roommate.

1934
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:53,860
Tempo.

1935
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,620
When did you move in with Hal?

1936
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,920
After our TSM house ended.

1937
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,640
Oh, so is it just you and Hal?

1938
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,080
Yeah, TSM house ended.

1939
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,300
Reps and Verhulst both went back home.

1940
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,120
And they're living with family.

1941
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,580
And then I stayed here.

1942
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,580
And he had a house here.

1943
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,880
So I just moved in.

1944
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,380
Oh, yeah.

1945
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,020
I was going to say.

1946
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,640
He's not even in TSM anymore.

1947
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,200
I was like, how are you at his house?

1948
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,620
Are you like his...

1949
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,260
Do you clean up for him?

1950
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,380
No, I'm just the roommate.

1951
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,380
Oh, you're just the roommate.

1952
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,280
Do you cook for him?

1953
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:32,840
Here and there.

1954
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,040
Oh, so you're like his cook.

1955
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,280
Here and there.

1956
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,280
Yeah, live-in chef.

1957
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,580
Yeah, the live-in chef.

1958
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,140
That's the dream.

1959
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,020
That's my second job.

1960
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,640
So when I was in university...

1961
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:44,980
Yeah?

1962
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,850
The first year I lived on campus.

1963
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,320
So it was dorm and...

1964
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,400
A dorm.

1965
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,460
It was the same.

1966
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,560
Normally what a dorm is.

1967
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But for year two and three, I lived with three other guys.

1968
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,320
Oh, that sounds terrible.

1969
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,600
And it got to the point...

1970
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,340
Yeah, it was so bad.

1971
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,160
It got to the point where we had mold growing out of our sink.

1972
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:07,600
Oh!

1973
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,800
Okay, that sounds like the college experience.

1974
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,700
So then...

1975
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,080
Then the deal changed to...

1976
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,380
The three roommates pay for...

1977
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,780
The three roommates pay for the entire rent and all our groceries.

1978
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,740
And in return, I cook and clean all of our common areas.

1979
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,900
And everyone gets three meals a day.

1980
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,900
Monday to Friday.

1981
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,620
Three meals?

1982
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,580
That's one meal too many.

1983
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,700
And then I just, for like two years, I never paid rent or paid for food.

1984
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,640
Oh, so you're like...

1985
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,860
You're like the live-in maid.

1986
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:47,900
Yeah.

1987
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,560
Yeah, you're like the...

1988
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,000
Yeah, that's right.

1989
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,560
I am a live-in maid.

1990
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,820
Oh my god, what was that like?

1991
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,120
Being a live-in maid.

1992
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,060
Was it just like the anime?

1993
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,620
Yeah, I wore an outfit and everything.

1994
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,300
Oh my god, you should do that on stream.

1995
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,440
Yeah, wait, how many...

1996
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,560
What's like a sub-goal for a maid outfit?

1997
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,080
Yeah, yeah, what's a sub-goal to recreate it?

1998
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:12,320
Fuck no.

1999
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:12,320
Never.

2000
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,580
I ain't doing no sub-goal.

2001
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,420
Not even for 50 gifted?

2002
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,260
What the fuck?

2003
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,060
So Doki's gonna do a maid outfit for 50 gifted?

2004
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,740
No, no, you're gonna do...

2005
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,520
You're the live-in maid here.

2006
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,160
You already have the experience.

2007
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,440
Why are you so afraid?

2008
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,400
I have the...

2009
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,400
You know that fluffy thingy on a stick?

2010
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,200
What?

2011
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,240
That you use to clean dust?

2012
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,380
I don't even know...

2013
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,660
You're a fucking duster?

2014
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,640
Is that called a duster?

2015
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,460
I thought you were the maid.

2016
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,100
Oh, I just buy stuff and use it.

2017
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,100
I don't know what it's called.

2018
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,520
Oh, this fluffy thing looks like it'll deal with dust well.

2019
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,140
What's that fluffy thing that dusts stuff?

2020
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,820
Okay, I thought it had a name, alright?

2021
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,620
Like a specific name.

2022
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,660
It's a duster.

2023
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,120
It's a duster.

2024
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,760
That does not involve the words fluffy or duster.

2025
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,240
Yeah, because it doesn't involve fluffy.

2026
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Wait, they said it's a feather duster, alright?

2027
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,720
That's two different things.

2028
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,280
Feather is different than fluffy.

2029
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,860
Oh man, what a crime.

2030
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,420
He forgot the feather part.

2031
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,180
Wait, so how many gifted tempo for a maid stream?

2032
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:29,180
I'm gonna need 10k for a maid stream because I will have to live that down.

2033
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,300
10k gifted or 10k done?

2034
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,580
I need 10k subs.

2035
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,260
You were a maid before.

2036
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,640
What do you mean you can't live it down?

2037
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,500
You've done it before.

2038
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,500
It's called off stream private.

2039
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,600
What if you just show up on...

2040
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,120
How many subs if you just show up on Hal's stream?

2041
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,820
That's the same thing.

2042
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,560
You just like walk by in the background.

2043
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,040
Yeah, just walk by his background and just clean something and then that's it.

2044
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,980
Let me just dust your pictures over here.

2045
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,120
Yeah, just turn around.

2046
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,740
Turn around, bend over and...

2047
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,580
And Hal's background.

2048
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,660
That would be so...

2049
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,140
Oh my god.

2050
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,520
My professionalism would be gone out the window.

2051
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,500
I hope now it will be gone.

2052
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,720
Nobody is like...

2053
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,580
People will be like, no we can't join tempo streams.

2054
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,540
Have you not seen Hal's stream today?

2055
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,020
Oh my god.

2056
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,480
Oh man.

2057
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:30,420
If you don't...

2058
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,320
If it was 1k it would have been feasible.

2059
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,220
But 10k...

2060
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,100
I am not doing that.

2061
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,580
You're not selling your soul for 1k subs.

2062
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,700
That's a lot of money already.

2063
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,900
You know those questions where it's like...

2064
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,740
Where it's like...

2065
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,480
Like you have the option to do...

2066
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,220
Would you do this for a million dollars or whatever?

2067
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:55,960
Yeah.

2068
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2069
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,640
This is like one of those.

2070
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,120
I would rather make the million dollars myself than do that.

2071
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,560
Well, well, Mac.

2072
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,520
Do you have a price?

2073
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,520
Do I have a price?

2074
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2075
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,420
Let's stay on topic here.

2076
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,100
This is about tempo.

2077
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,040
I'm just wondering.

2078
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,680
Motherfuckers want to be like, oh yeah.

2079
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,820
I need 20k subs.

2080
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,020
I'm just saying, Mac.

2081
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,420
I'm more expensive than tempo.

2082
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,380
You're more expensive than tempo?

2083
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:24,760
Yeah, see?

2084
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,400
There you go.

2085
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,280
That's right.

2086
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,560
Just because you don't have the...

2087
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,020
No, you have less experience.

2088
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,400
You should be less expensive.

2089
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,320
No, no, no.

2090
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,640
Because you don't have the experience to back it up.

2091
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,280
That's how...

2092
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,560
That's how the real world works.

2093
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,840
The real world isn't real.

2094
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,080
You might as well do it for free because you're an intern.

2095
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,360
Gather the experience.

2096
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,520
Oh my god.

2097
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,680
Alright, let's see how people do.

2098
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,260
Hey, we got two points!

2099
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:04,800
Yippee!

2100
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,760
Holy shit, some people got 10 or 11 kills.

2101
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,000
How did they get more kills in this...

2102
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,680
in this moment versus the other mode?

2103
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,780
Oh my god.

2104
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,660
Someone said re-drinking.

2105
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:23,860
Ugh.

2106
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,790
I can't believe...

2107
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:33,570
I can't believe you used to be a main, Tempo.

2108
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:34,130
I can't believe you used to be a main, Tempo.

2109
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:39,510
I always learn a new thing about you every Twitch Rivals.

2110
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,490
Also, Tempo, Also, Tempo, why is Wig not in Twitch Rivals?

2111
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,030
You know why?

2112
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,530
Still trying to get rid of me.

2113
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:52,870
Still trying to get rid of me.

2114
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,690
No, we would be last place...

2115
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,510
No, no, I'm just saying we would be last place if Wig was on Twitch Rivals.

2116
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:58,010
If Wig was on our team.

2117
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,010
It's tradition.

2118
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,910
No, second last place.

2119
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:02,490
We improved.

2120
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:03,790
We got second last place.

2121
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,910
So we improved like one tier.

2122
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,910
This is actually the best Tempo I have...

2123
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,490
No, no, we actually won the game.

2124
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:12,590
We actually won.

2125
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,390
Oh shit, I thought I was talking this whole time.

2126
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,590
We improved with one game.

2127
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:20,010
We got better with game one than we did last Twitch Rivals.

2128
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,310
Yeah, literally...

2129
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:26,810
That game one we did is the best we've ever done.

2130
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:28,190
Versus Wig.

2131
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,330
That's the...

2132
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,690
That's the most...

2133
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:35,250
No, Wig, Tempo...

2134
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,550
I think that was the most points we've ever gained overall.

2135
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:38,590
In one game.

2136
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:39,090
Yeah.

2137
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:44,130
Yeah, I'm pretty sure all we had were single digit games.

2138
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:46,530
We never...

2139
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:50,010
Even overall, we beat our overall point score.

2140
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:53,490
So I'm pretty proud of this.

2141
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:55,690
We're like, we're maybe in sixth place.

2142
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,190
I mean... I know.

2143
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,430
It's not that bad.

2144
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,390
I can't really tell.

2145
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,770
We don't know the gun bonuses and stuff.

2146
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,150
You know?

2147
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,970
Someone's like, how do you keep friends Doki?

2148
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,410
Tempo and Wig roasted me live at ALGSB broadcast.

2149
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,010
Right now, at best like...

2150
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,910
Okay, at best like...

2151
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,070
2k people heard what I said.

2152
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:18,390
Wig and Tempo...

2153
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,810
Don't think I don't remember Tempo.

2154
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:23,050
You and Wig fucking roasted me in front of...

2155
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,070
Roasted me in front of like 80,000 people.

2156
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:29,910
At ALGSB stream.

2157
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:32,290
I get to do what I want right now.

2158
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,050
What did they say?

2159
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:42,710
I don't know Tempo, what did you guys say?

2160
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:43,770
I forget.

2161
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,370
I don't remember.

2162
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:48,290
My memory...

2163
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,890
I don't have short term or long term memory.

2164
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,830
I just...

2165
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:52,870
Yeah.

2166
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:55,250
It's okay.

2167
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,570
Your brain is just Apex Grimms.

2168
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,470
Yeah.

2169
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:00,970
I mean, that's basically it.

2170
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,830
When we play Apex, we're all a little special.

2171
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,550
Also, I'm pretty sure you were drunk too.

2172
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:07,790
Wait, who's team 7?

2173
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:08,310
Always.

2174
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,510
Well, it's Tempo.

2175
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:10,070
That's a given.

2176
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,350
Team 7 and team 1.

2177
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,190
I appreciate...

2178
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:15,430
Yeah, I remember.

2179
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,710
He was definitely fucking plastered.

2180
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:18,470
During ALGS.

2181
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:19,810
Yes, you were.

2182
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,930
He doesn't even remember.

2183
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,210
Only one of the ALGSs I drank.

2184
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,550
Only one, okay.

2185
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:30,890
Yeah, I think.

2186
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2187
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:32,050
Only one.

2188
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:35,670
It's not very confident when you said, I think, right after.

2189
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:38,550
So, like, I don't even trust your memory at that point.

2190
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:38,810
Listen.

2191
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,430
I don't remember.

2192
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,370
Someone in my chat was like, maybe the only one...

2193
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:47,230
the only one he remembers.

2194
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:53,750
Pathfinder, Crypto...

2195
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,430
Is it still Spitfire Reef?

2196
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,230
Is it Spitfire Reef?

2197
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:00,490
Yeah, still.

2198
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,130
Okay, so, like, is it Revival or...

2199
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:04,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2200
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,770
Okay, so we're gonna do our team chats.

2201
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:08,870
Well, no.

2202
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,670
Ash, Maggie...

2203
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:11,810
Oh, wait.

2204
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:12,570
I'm gonna play Pathfinder.

2205
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,850
Okay, so Path...

2206
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:16,090
So what do we play, Mac?

2207
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:19,490
Um...

2208
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:23,290
Um...

2209
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,470
Question?

2210
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,410
Tempo could play Crypto.

2211
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,030
Tempo could play Crypto.

2212
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,090
Oh, right.

2213
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:30,890
I'm going Invisible.

2214
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:32,590
Yeah, yeah.

2215
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:33,410
Yeah, yeah.

2216
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:39,850
Like, you should literally run in the middle of, like, wherever we're chilling and just get on your drone and go Invis.

2217
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:42,250
But you have to make sure your drone never breaks or you're dead.

2218
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,230
Yeah, that's so true.

2219
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,990
Don't be in the middle of everybody just in case it breaks.

2220
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:49,990
Like, at least be in, like, a good spot, you know?

2221
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:53,330
Wait, if I'm in Crypto and someone else Cryptos, can they see me?

2222
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,350
No, no, no.

2223
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,850
You're literally off the grid.

2224
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:57,810
It's Scout or Akimbo P20.

2225
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:02,370
Oh, that Akimbo P20 is so strong!

2226
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:06,890
Oh, so I'll EMP them and then you just Scout them to death.

2227
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:07,510
Yeah!

2228
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,470
That's the strat!

2229
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:08,470
Yeah, exactly.

2230
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:09,810
You see where they opened here?

2231
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:13,310
Alright, we got our plan.

2232
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:14,510
Alright.

2233
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:15,970
You could play...

2234
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,610
Caustic or, like...

2235
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:22,650
You could play Ash or Maggie if you want, or Loba.

2236
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:23,850
You could play whatever you want, yeah.

2237
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,410
Do you want a controller for beacon though?

2238
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,270
Pick whatever you want here.

2239
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:29,250
No, because Pathfinder has a...

2240
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,690
Wait, no, I can't...

2241
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:31,490
Don't give me free will.

2242
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,390
It won't work well.

2243
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:36,130
Wait, can Pathfinder scan both of them or just one?

2244
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:38,570
Well, you can hit your abilities.

2245
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,170
I have the other, never mind.

2246
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,950
Yeah, and then I can hit ring consoles.

2247
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:43,890
And then...

2248
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,610
You have free will.

2249
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,830
No, I don't want that!

2250
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,450
This is why I passed the Captive!

2251
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:51,490
Go Ash.

2252
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,350
Go Ash so you can run away in case.

2253
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,370
Alright, I'll go Ash.

2254
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:54,750
Okay.

2255
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:56,170
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

2256
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,070
Go Maggie.

2257
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:57,710
Maggie?

2258
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:58,070
Okay.

2259
01:18:58,450 --> 01:18:59,570
Yeah, don't listen to Tempo.

2260
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:01,210
Wait, Maggie can also run away.

2261
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:01,690
I forgot.

2262
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:05,870
Maggie can run away, but Maggie can also get up in some guts if we're, like, breaching someone.

2263
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,390
You EMP and we Maggie ball through their fucking door.

2264
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2265
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:11,690
FBI, open up!

2266
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,190
Just fucking bust in their building with an EMP.

2267
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,950
And then...

2268
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:19,050
And then Tempo, all he has to do is just be alive.

2269
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:21,130
Wait, where did we land last game?

2270
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:21,450
So low.

2271
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:23,590
We landed on some guy that was their lifeline.

2272
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:24,590
And we killed him.

2273
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:27,230
We had an actual POI too, right?

2274
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,290
No, we did not land on that POI.

2275
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:31,750
We literally just followed somebody.

2276
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:34,270
The thing that I was gonna land on was not a POI.

2277
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,130
It was a no-name next to a POI.

2278
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:37,650
And I was gonna cyber-bully that team.

2279
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:39,890
Alright, well let's do that again.

2280
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,230
That was my plan.

2281
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:44,250
That person will continuously be our free kill.

2282
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,770
That one guy.

2283
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:49,790
They're like, there's no way we're gonna land on a second time.

2284
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,130
What are the odds?

2285
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,230
How do they know?

2286
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:54,790
We're very stubborn and stupid.

2287
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,690
We have nothing to lose.

2288
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,020
I'm so excited.

2289
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,680
Is this like six games?

2290
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,220
Like the usual?

2291
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,260
Might be eight.

2292
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,040
Could be twelve.

2293
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,800
Okay, now I'm fucking gonna look at it.

2294
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:11,280
Now...

2295
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,800
I do not have that much time in my life.

2296
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,880
What's the thought of being stuck with us for eight or more games?

2297
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,360
What's the thought of being stuck with us for eight or more games?

2298
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:26,800
I told them we're just gonna land whatever has a beacon and a player scan.

2299
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,020
So no one will know until the game starts.

2300
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:30,720
Nice.

2301
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,160
I don't think anybody cares to be fair.

2302
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,120
I don't think anyone can keep track.

2303
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,880
That's when we triple land on them.

2304
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,880
Yeah, that guy they got triple landed on.

2305
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,540
I bet he cared.

2306
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,300
I bet that guy cared a lot.

2307
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,140
I wish I knew.

2308
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,640
Guys, do you guys know who we landed on that one solo?

2309
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:48,740
Does anyone know?

2310
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,780
Oh wait, I killed a guy with a Spitfire.

2311
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,000
I should get a bonus point for that now.

2312
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,880
Wait, was that first game?

2313
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,720
The World's Edge game?

2314
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,880
Yeah, the World's Edge game.

2315
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,700
Yeah, did you tell them?

2316
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,420
Do you have to tell them?

2317
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,400
I think so.

2318
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,780
I feel like they have a way to track it.

2319
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,500
By the way, I got a kill.

2320
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:11,740
Twitch.

2321
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:12,660
Rivals.

2322
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,040
Schedule.

2323
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,420
Get involved.

2324
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,220
Wait, wrong button.

2325
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:20,600
Next tournament.

2326
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,520
Bracket.

2327
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,220
Leaderboard.

2328
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:29,600
Okay, the leaderboard is on the Twitch Rivals page, but it is not up here.

2329
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,260
Oh, they said we got those, no worry.

2330
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,820
It was like, good job, Alb!

2331
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,240
Huge!

2332
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,120
You're killing it.

2333
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,880
Let's go.

2334
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,780
My friends are so supportive.

2335
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,160
They're so supportive.

2336
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,340
They said hit the red button.

2337
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,440
They would never make fun of me.

2338
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:53,960
Yeah!

2339
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,620
They're giving you moral support.

2340
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,640
Is that design for Astro Mode on?

2341
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,800
That was like, good job, Alb!

2342
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,100
Yeah, that was fun.

2343
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,140
Alright guys, here's my gaslighting, by the way.

2344
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,280
Guys.

2345
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:15,260
This is what I wrote.

2346
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,540
You have to report each kill right after or it doesn't count.

2347
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,480
Fucking hell.

2348
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,320
If you reply to him with, I guess you won't have to report anything then.

2349
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,680
I can't say that because I'm not a pro player.

2350
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,900
OG kill race.

2351
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,520
Yeah, where you'd fucking screenshot your scores and send it in with a timestamp of your bod.

2352
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:39,780
Oh no!

2353
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,680
I hate this!

2354
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,300
Oh my god, I remember that.

2355
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,640
I remember this too!

2356
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,900
I swear, we had a tournament That shit sucked.

2357
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,640
We had a tournament like a few months ago where...

2358
01:22:53,360 --> 01:23:09,880
it was a company it was an org or a company or whatever that did an event back then and then they came back and did an event like recently and they were like, yeah, you gotta screenshot the results so we can put it in because they haven't been in Apex for like years.

2359
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:10,260
Yeah.

2360
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,440
That sounds terrible.

2361
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:18,580
Yeah, they're like, hey, screenshot it and send it to us and all the players were like, what the fuck?

2362
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,060
That sounds fucking terrible.

2363
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,920
Holy shit.

2364
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,220
I just remembered I hated those kill races though Alright, team 10 is a duo.

2365
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:27,740
Int them!

2366
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,940
Do you have the scores?

2367
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:31,760
No.

2368
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,800
Are you keeping score?

2369
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:36,480
This is what I think it is, but I don't know.

2370
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,560
Because it doesn't have the special guns.

2371
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,940
This one doesn't have the special guns.

2372
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,080
The fact that you're going to...

2373
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,320
Or the Rivals guys said that we need a Polaroid submitted to Twitch HQ.

2374
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,020
And Watson got minus 5, I think?

2375
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,780
Must be mailed via USPS.

2376
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:51,660
Bruh.

2377
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,520
You guys are tied for second, kind of.

2378
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,720
Wait, you're keeping track of Hal's team too?

2379
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:58,920
Like...

2380
01:23:59,540 --> 01:23:59,980
What?

2381
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,140
You're keeping track of Hal's scores?

2382
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:03,700
How?

2383
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,160
I'm keeping track of all of our scores.

2384
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,180
Yeah, but you don't know their bonus points.

2385
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,280
Oh yeah, without the bonus points.

2386
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,440
The only thing I'm keeping track of is the actual match summary.

2387
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,160
So it should be kind of close, right?

2388
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,200
I thought you said you were off work.

2389
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,880
Why are you helping Hal keep track?

2390
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,960
Because I want to make sure the teams that pick the wrong...

2391
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,280
Oh true, it's his rules.

2392
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,580
I want to make sure the people that pick the wrong character...

2393
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,920
I want to make sure they get the negative 5.

2394
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:28,860
That's so fucked up.

2395
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,040
I like making people's lives miserable.

2396
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,140
Bruh, and you guys say I'm toxic.

2397
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:37,080
Bruh, that's the most fucking toxic thing I've heard.

2398
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,080
Bruh, and you guys say I'm toxic.

2399
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,580
You fucked up?

2400
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,220
Minus 5.

2401
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,700
We won't forget.

2402
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,040
We won't forget.

2403
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,780
Jesus Christ.

2404
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,560
Yo, the two teams are still in the negatives, okay?

2405
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,200
Are they actually?

2406
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,320
Holy shit, wait.

2407
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,060
Okay, we're sure of 4.

2408
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:53,920
Negative 1 and negative 3.

2409
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,660
Oh my god.

2410
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,740
Team 15, where are you?

2411
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:02,980
Oh my god.

2412
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,120
There's no way.

2413
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,820
Oh wait, and that one's accurate because they didn't get any kills the second game.

2414
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,060
No, no, because they have placement.

2415
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,080
They're 6th place last game.

2416
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,360
Yeah, that only gets you 12, 9, 7, 5, 4, 3?

2417
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,500
That only gets you 3 points.

2418
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,760
Oh, so they're... okay.

2419
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,340
Wait, what am I playing again?

2420
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:18,580
Maggie.

2421
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,960
Okay, where is she?

2422
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,220
She's in the middle of the screen.

2423
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,640
Quite literally.

2424
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,060
Okay, guys, we might get minus 5.

2425
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:28,840
We might get our minus 5 on first pick.

2426
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,160
I already picked Crypto.

2427
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,100
Oh, thank god, okay.

2428
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,400
Guys, guys, okay.

2429
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,200
Oh, thank god, thank you.

2430
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,320
I will highlight this for you, so you do not miss it.

2431
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,580
Guys, if anybody's getting the minus 5, it's me.

2432
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,760
I'm waiting for someone else to minus 5 right now.

2433
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:48,420
With this comp, unironically, we can go door-to-door and just blow people up.

2434
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,560
I actually know how to play this properly.

2435
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,460
As long as Crypto doesn't kill his fucking drone.

2436
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,460
I'm ready.

2437
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:59,660
Bro, okay, you're putting so much hope on the fact that Temple doesn't kill his drone.

2438
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,900
Yo, I have 28 kills with Crypto.

2439
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,020
Oh, Jesus.

2440
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,840
That's actually 28 more than I thought.

2441
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,040
Only god can help us.

2442
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:09,920
That's 28 more than I thought.

2443
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,560
Because I don't remember when I played Crypto.

2444
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,100
Wait, oh, my game is not...

2445
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:15,640
Oh, there we go.

2446
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:19,120
Good chance we might just insta-jump if I don't see anybody go straight down.

2447
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,560
Okay.

2448
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,420
Wait, what are we doing?

2449
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,920
This is called boardwalk, I think.

2450
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,400
Oh, wait, nobody's here?

2451
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,440
Wait, no one's at that POI either.

2452
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,540
There's a solo going over there.

2453
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,600
There's one person!

2454
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,840
I'm going towards you, you cunt!

2455
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,680
You guys better watch out, Tempo's inbound.

2456
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,180
Oh, no!

2457
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,300
Tempo, the biggest threat right now!

2458
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,640
He sees you!

2459
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,500
Yeah, I'm the biggest griefer.

2460
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,720
I should be scared.

2461
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,260
Wait, how do I get out of this building?

2462
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,700
What were the guns again?

2463
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,400
Scout and akimbo P20.

2464
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,340
Okay, that's...

2465
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:00,380
Alright, I'll do that.

2466
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,160
I'll run a scout.

2467
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,160
Well, I was going to say, you might want to run a shotgun on Maggie.

2468
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,400
The akimbo Milsims.

2469
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,240
Yeah, I got the akimbo Milsims.

2470
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,820
I have it right now.

2471
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:10,660
Yeah, yeah.

2472
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,440
Use it, use it.

2473
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,120
Then who's going to do the P20?

2474
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,000
Charge rifle?

2475
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:14,340
Okay.

2476
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,360
I just think we won't.

2477
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,040
Oh, okay.

2478
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,880
Alright, good talk, good talk.

2479
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,300
What is going on over there?

2480
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,400
Did Hal fucking die?

2481
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,720
I guess so.

2482
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,700
What the fuck happened to him?

2483
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,100
Alright, I looted.

2484
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:36,820
I looted here.

2485
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,120
Where?

2486
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,860
Where did the solo go?

2487
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,680
He was too far.

2488
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,400
Let him get away.

2489
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,480
Let him get away?

2490
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,320
I thought you had your eyes on him.

2491
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:47,000
I did.

2492
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,100
I hit a wall.

2493
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,980
And then I was like, well...

2494
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,920
Well, I guess he's gone.

2495
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:55,000
Wait, I found an evil harvester.

2496
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,520
We can rat this.

2497
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,940
We can rat this?

2498
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,900
We're not ratting an evil harvester.

2499
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,800
Should I do fireball?

2500
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,240
Or shots, shots, shots?

2501
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,100
The auto-reload?

2502
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,320
The auto-reload.

2503
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,380
Okay, auto-reload shotguns on Nox?

2504
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,140
Yeah, and then you're gonna Kimbo Mozambiques.

2505
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,480
We need to get you hammer points.

2506
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,880
Why do I have 18 nades like I'm playing Fuse?

2507
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:16,860
Why do I have 18 nades like I'm playing Fuse?

2508
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,800
I don't know.

2509
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:21,520
I'm still looking for a scout as well.

2510
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:23,800
We need...

2511
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,220
Oh, they're killing people already.

2512
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,700
Do we have like any...

2513
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,860
Oh, yeah, we need to find people scanner.

2514
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:31,420
Do we have like any...

2515
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:31,420
Oh, yeah, we need to find people scanner.

2516
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,000
Do I need that?

2517
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:33,340
No.

2518
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,220
Wait, people scanner here, right?

2519
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:37,980
Do we have one?

2520
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,780
We should have a people scanner.

2521
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,240
We should have a people scanner.

2522
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:41,900
Do you need this, Cookie?

2523
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,060
Yes, I do.

2524
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,020
I have a blue.

2525
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:48,360
Yes, I do.

2526
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:48,360
I have a blue.

2527
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,500
Should I scan this now?

2528
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:49,660
Should I scan this now?

2529
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:50,700
Yeah, hit it.

2530
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,200
We can just see where we're at.

2531
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,020
Oh, wait, what?

2532
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:55,360
There's two people coming to us.

2533
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:56,820
Just trying to get kills.

2534
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,340
They're literally running right at us.

2535
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,440
Yeah, we can kill them.

2536
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,020
I think I heard a crypto scan, but not from you.

2537
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:07,260
I think I heard a crypto scan, but not from you.

2538
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,520
Yeah, play up with me.

2539
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:09,740
Where are they?

2540
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,280
They should be over here, Tempo.

2541
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,360
You're going the wrong way.

2542
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,780
Yeah, but he should stay hidden in case we all got away.

2543
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,520
No, he's on his drone.

2544
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,280
Okay, okay.

2545
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,460
They should be around here.

2546
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:22,900
They should be around here.

2547
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,260
Fast and Furious!

2548
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,020
Flash, flash, flash!

2549
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,380
Over here.

2550
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,020
Yeah.

2551
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,220
Can you drill that guy's door?

2552
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, I'm fucking...

2553
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,440
I didn't drill the door, but...

2554
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:41,700
I'm on him.

2555
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:43,520
Fast and Furious!

2556
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,400
Excellent.

2557
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:46,640
Yippee!

2558
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,480
Wait, did we thirst the other guy, or no?

2559
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,260
I don't know where the other guy went.

2560
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,640
He said, I got two kills from that.

2561
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:55,100
You got two kills?

2562
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:55,620
Nice.

2563
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,860
Do I get out of this?

2564
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:58,540
No, you're chilling.

2565
01:29:58,540 --> 01:29:59,840
Tokyo Drift!

2566
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,200
Alright, should we do the ring scan?

2567
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,620
Yeah, yeah.

2568
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,460
We just look for kills over here.

2569
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,580
No, Tempo, you didn't scan the ring.

2570
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,340
I called that beacon.

2571
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,940
You gotta be off the grid.

2572
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,540
You have to be invisible, Tempo.

2573
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,120
Tempo!

2574
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,180
Wait, do I move faster if I'm on the ground?

2575
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:28,940
Oh yeah, I do.

2576
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:30,940
Tokyo Drift!

2577
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,300
Let's get scootin'.

2578
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,340
We'll start scootin' along this way and hit the CIV.

2579
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,040
Let's go, Tempo.

2580
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:36,580
Get out of the drone.

2581
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:36,820
Okay.

2582
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:37,900
Which is this way?

2583
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,160
This way?

2584
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,080
Are you orange?

2585
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:41,500
Yes.

2586
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,440
I am orange.

2587
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,760
Alright, I'm heading over.

2588
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:48,200
If I die first, then just don't go my way and I'll just respawn.

2589
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:49,520
Okay.

2590
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,820
That's literally what we need to do.

2591
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,620
Who's ready to fly on a zip line?

2592
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,720
I made us a zip, Tempo.

2593
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:56,220
I am!

2594
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:58,580
Alright.

2595
01:30:59,540 --> 01:30:59,900
Oh.

2596
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,840
You made him a zip and not...

2597
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,640
Fast and Furious!

2598
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:04,900
Um.

2599
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,580
I will not be there.

2600
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,460
Because I'm blue.

2601
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,660
I'm getting crypto-droned.

2602
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:13,340
Sir.

2603
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,040
I broke their drone.

2604
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:15,740
Let's commit four crimes.

2605
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,420
Wait, where are they?

2606
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:17,980
Over here.

2607
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,900
Alright, Tempo.

2608
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:19,440
You gotta be invisible.

2609
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,020
I gotta go hide in the toilet.

2610
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:21,720
Tempo, get on your drone.

2611
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,600
Get rid of the EMP of them.

2612
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:25,980
Alright.

2613
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,020
I'm not in the toilet, but you know.

2614
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:28,940
Yeah, I'm waiting.

2615
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,520
I'm literally on the bottom.

2616
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,820
They're in here.

2617
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:32,600
Okay.

2618
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,860
Is it more than one team?

2619
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,100
No, it's just one.

2620
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:36,600
Just one.

2621
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:36,920
Just one.

2622
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,580
You have the range?

2623
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:40,340
Hey, guys.

2624
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,020
Oh, shit!

2625
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,920
I just whiffed so badly.

2626
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:47,560
I'm gonna bleed out.

2627
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:48,280
Okay.

2628
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,420
I suck with these moves.

2629
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:51,620
What?

2630
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,000
I'm Tokyo Drifting!

2631
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,440
Tokyo Drifting!

2632
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,760
I can't tell you.

2633
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,760
No!

2634
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:01,680
He's one!

2635
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,420
He's literally one!

2636
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,640
Goodbye.

2637
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,220
Don't worry, guys.

2638
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:04,920
I'm still alive.

2639
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:05,880
He's literally one!

2640
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,660
If he wasn't so fucking chunky!

2641
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,100
Oh, shit!

2642
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:11,680
My drone died.

2643
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,660
Oh, I'm in zone.

2644
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,040
Wait, what?

2645
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,300
Wait, why am I not respawning?

2646
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:18,740
Oh, okay.

2647
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,220
Four seconds.

2648
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,200
Oh, okay.

2649
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,260
Yeah, I was, like, spectating.

2650
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:26,730
Wait, where do we land?

2651
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,390
All I know is I just need more meds.

2652
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,130
We just hold this team.

2653
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:34,150
Okay.

2654
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:37,330
We stay on this side of the wall, we just go this way, and we try to kill these guys.

2655
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,730
Alright, I'm dropping in.

2656
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:40,910
Hit one for 60.

2657
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:42,870
What the fuck?

2658
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:43,590
Why am I floating?

2659
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:46,650
Like...

2660
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:49,710
I'm just gracefully floating down.

2661
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,770
I hate this.

2662
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:54,290
What is under me?

2663
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:55,850
What is under me?

2664
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:59,070
I'm not really landing at a very ideal spot.

2665
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:01,490
I'm not really landing at a very ideal spot.

2666
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:02,290
I'm in this house.

2667
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,890
Oh, don't get farmed!

2668
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:09,590
I broke that crypto drone again.

2669
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,430
One's on the roof, right here.

2670
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:12,530
You pinged them?

2671
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:13,830
He's trying to gasnade me.

2672
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:14,970
I'm looking.

2673
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:17,690
I'm healing.

2674
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:22,030
Yeah, our lifeline is healing right now.

2675
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:24,110
Yeah, Tempo, just go all the way around that way, okay?

2676
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:28,870
I found them.

2677
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:29,330
They're on...

2678
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:30,810
Do you have EMP, Tempo?

2679
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:31,570
Nope.

2680
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:32,170
60%.

2681
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,810
They made a...

2682
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:35,370
They made a zip.

2683
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,170
Is that a zip?

2684
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:36,810
No, never mind.

2685
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:38,350
Is that...

2686
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,450
I can't see that properly.

2687
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:41,490
They are over there.

2688
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:44,790
Oh, there's...

2689
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:46,070
Their crypto drone is here.

2690
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,550
Shoot that shit!

2691
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,990
I'm trying to shoot it, but then they're shooting me, too.

2692
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:53,170
Wait, where am I?

2693
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,770
Wait, they got EMP'd by someone else.

2694
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,010
Yeah.

2695
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,650
Come to me, come to me.

2696
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:57,250
Okay.

2697
01:33:58,010 --> 01:33:59,210
You have to stay low ground.

2698
01:33:59,350 --> 01:33:59,630
You can't...

2699
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:00,390
You're not gonna be able to get up here.

2700
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:03,630
I think I broke their drone with my fucking drill.

2701
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:06,050
Tempo, we're going.

2702
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:06,530
We're moving.

2703
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:07,770
Goodbye, Tempo.

2704
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:09,430
Wait, I'm trying to hit this shit.

2705
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:10,810
Tempo, goodbye.

2706
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:11,130
Oh.

2707
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:12,850
We gotta go street market.

2708
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:14,410
Okay.

2709
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:17,070
We have 43 seconds, though.

2710
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:20,890
Oh, wait.

2711
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:21,910
That's the only team that's here.

2712
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:22,570
Yeah.

2713
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,110
Wait, then whose drone did I fucking...

2714
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,070
break?

2715
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:29,710
They were just EMP'ing themselves.

2716
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:31,870
Yeah, I was like, what?

2717
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,930
Probably a solo hidden crypto somewhere.

2718
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:35,190
Yeah, but you didn't see any.

2719
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:35,630
That's the thing.

2720
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:38,190
Who ran away as soon as the drone died.

2721
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,390
Let's try as heat shields are on.

2722
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:41,570
Ooh.

2723
01:34:41,710 --> 01:34:42,490
I have a heat shield.

2724
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,070
Yeah.

2725
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:44,770
It's not whatchamacallit mode.

2726
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:45,470
We gotta go-go.

2727
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:46,850
We have 14 seconds.

2728
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:49,630
Yo, there's super bins soon.

2729
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:50,830
Yeah, yeah.

2730
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:52,730
We're gonna come in like over...

2731
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,830
Omega little bins.

2732
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:56,690
I'm going up first.

2733
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,730
With 18 million goals.

2734
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:00,070
I'm going second.

2735
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:05,030
Tempo, you just hit this.

2736
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:06,030
Hit this on the way.

2737
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,190
On the way.

2738
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:09,930
Oh, I hear lots of gunshots in front of us.

2739
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:10,230
Mhm.

2740
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:12,450
I don't like the sound of that.

2741
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,330
We should have high ground up here.

2742
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:17,870
To look down on some free kills.

2743
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:18,730
Alright.

2744
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:20,270
But what if they're there too?

2745
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:24,130
Wait, Tempo, do you have enough meds?

2746
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:25,090
Tempo?

2747
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:27,490
What?

2748
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:28,410
You have enough meds?

2749
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:28,750
Okay.

2750
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,450
I have four syringes.

2751
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:32,150
Oh, yay.

2752
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,310
Oh, there's two people in front of us.

2753
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,310
Oh, three.

2754
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:38,710
Never mind.

2755
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,130
It's three.

2756
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,210
They should...

2757
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,310
We should be able to hold them.

2758
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:44,630
Where?

2759
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:47,150
On the other side of this building.

2760
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:48,570
Okay.

2761
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,330
I hear them.

2762
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,930
I feel like they're ratting.

2763
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:58,050
I'm gonna peek.

2764
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,190
Okay.

2765
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:02,850
They're in here.

2766
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:04,210
I'm gonna full heal then.

2767
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:07,590
Tempo's with us, so like...

2768
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:08,610
I'm just running.

2769
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:12,370
Tempo, get on your drone.

2770
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:12,750
Go invis.

2771
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,650
And I think we might kill the ghost.

2772
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:17,790
Oh, it just broke it.

2773
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:18,410
Oh, no.

2774
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:19,570
I'm dead.

2775
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:19,890
I'm dead.

2776
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:21,230
Tempo, we need you to live.

2777
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:22,210
We need you to live.

2778
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:22,830
I'm gonna bleed out.

2779
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,320
No, he found me.

2780
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:29,860
He found me.

2781
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,260
You have to live through the zone.

2782
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:33,420
Run, Doki.

2783
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,280
No, it's Mac, and I'm worried he's gonna die in zone.

2784
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:37,880
Fucking heals.

2785
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,440
You have no heals?

2786
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,660
I'm not in zone and I died.

2787
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,320
I wasn't in zone.

2788
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,480
I wasn't even in the zone on my screen.

2789
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:50,800
Oh, my God.

2790
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,840
He died to leg.

2791
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:54,560
Wait, did you have no heals?

2792
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,200
I had no radials.

2793
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,120
I'm gonna give you my heals.

2794
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:00,300
I thought I was fine.

2795
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,140
I thought you were fine.

2796
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:04,320
You had no heals.

2797
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:10,020
I wasn't even in that zone and I just died.

2798
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,780
Oh, my God.

2799
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,280
Wait, how did they find you, Tempo?

2800
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,200
I don't know.

2801
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,460
How did they find me?

2802
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:19,540
How did they find you?

2803
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,560
Wait, they can hear you?

2804
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,220
Yeah, he makes a noise.

2805
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,760
He makes like a humming noise.

2806
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,560
Wait, really?

2807
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:28,860
I didn't...

2808
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,300
Oh, my God.

2809
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:36,080
The moment Tempo was right next to us, I knew it was over.

2810
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,120
The moment Tempo was right next to us, I knew it was over.

2811
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,560
I should have moved deeper into the thing.

2812
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:41,940
Our lifeline was gone.

2813
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,680
Wait, was this Evan's team that killed us?

2814
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,520
I have no idea.

2815
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,700
I almost destroyed the drone, too.

2816
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:51,060
I almost destroyed the drone, too.

2817
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:51,400
It sucked.

2818
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:52,960
It was so close.

2819
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,260
Damn.

2820
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,400
Wait, somebody... their third DC'd.

2821
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,280
Their third literally lost.

2822
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:02,960
He left the game.

2823
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,380
Wait, that sucks.

2824
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:08,600
The fuck was their third?

2825
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:09,960
The fuck was their third?

2826
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,780
Wait, he's... their third is out out.

2827
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,260
Whoever team this is.

2828
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,300
Oh, yeah, it's Evan.

2829
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,440
Evan just... what?

2830
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,640
Evan's third literally got kicked out of the game.

2831
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:27,530
Evan's third literally got kicked out of the game.

2832
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,690
He's not dead yet, so...

2833
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:34,330
Yeah, it's not last.

2834
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:37,730
Wait...

2835
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:41,550
Did you guys get both kills with a special gun?

2836
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,390
No, I had a Mos-M.

2837
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:45,930
Is Mos-M not...

2838
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,890
No, it's P20 and...

2839
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:49,650
and Scout.

2840
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:51,870
But we got two kills.

2841
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:52,930
Okay, all good.

2842
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,050
We are now at 20.

2843
01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:02,170
Yeah, no matter what, this is a lot better than how we usually do, Tempo.

2844
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:03,310
20 points is more than we got.

2845
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:05,310
And Challenger's so good, so...

2846
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:06,070
Oh, no, wait.

2847
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:06,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2848
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:11,190
No, it's more than we got in overall Twitch Rivals with Wig, so that's all that matters.

2849
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:20,430
I think the most points we got was like 15 or some shit in Twitch Rivals.

2850
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:26,850
Alright, I think this means we're gonna get like...

2851
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:27,950
7?

2852
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,170
Like 8?

2853
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:30,810
9?

2854
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:31,410
10?

2855
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:32,330
Or 11?

2856
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:32,730
12?

2857
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,110
Give me hope.

2858
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,510
I don't want to go in with...

2859
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:36,970
I want to go in with low expectations.

2860
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:41,530
Every Rivals, we've gotten in the middle, except for that one with Wig.

2861
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:49,910
Every Rivals, we've gotten like middle of... like even the...

2862
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:53,250
in-person stuff, we got like in the middle.

2863
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:55,550
Yeah, but then like...

2864
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:59,270
with the last two of Wig, we got last and second last.

2865
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:05,350
The reason they could see Tempo is because if you bleed out or get full killed, it scans the team.

2866
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:08,350
Wait, if who bleeds out?

2867
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:09,470
Like a different teammate?

2868
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:13,530
Yeah, I bleed out and I expose Tempo.

2869
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:17,290
It's okay, we might restart.

2870
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:21,010
We might restart because apparently a bunch of teams are getting DC'd.

2871
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:22,870
Because server is crashing.

2872
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,110
Because I guess... wait, what hour?

2873
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,510
Stop the game right now.

2874
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:31,070
We started this at 4.

2875
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:33,290
The server shouldn't crash.

2876
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:33,910
That's weird.

2877
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,970
Wait, but they're still playing the game.

2878
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:37,930
It's only an hour and 50...

2879
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:41,070
If the server was launched at 4 o'clock...

2880
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:44,510
Wait, but they're still playing the game though.

2881
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:45,570
Yeah.

2882
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:48,250
Let's let more people DC and then they have to restart.

2883
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:49,050
Okay, wait.

2884
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:50,490
How many people DC'd?

2885
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:51,150
I'm gonna check chat.

2886
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:52,890
Is the server shut down?

2887
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:54,050
I said it would happen.

2888
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:55,270
Oh, people are saying...

2889
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:57,830
Apparently that's a thing.

2890
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:00,750
I got 1, 2, 3...

2891
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:02,550
4...

2892
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,770
4 people.

2893
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:06,250
How can you see where people are saying they DC'd?

2894
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:07,930
It's literally in the chat.

2895
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:10,110
They're talking about who...

2896
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:15,690
Public lobby code closes every 2 hours.

2897
01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:18,190
Interesting.

2898
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:20,150
I feel like they won't...

2899
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:22,150
They'll count this and just be like...

2900
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:23,930
Not if the entire server closes.

2901
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:27,930
Can't count it if more than 10 teams are still alive and the server goes...

2902
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:28,850
GG.

2903
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:30,990
So we need the server to explode right now.

2904
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:32,270
Someone quick...

2905
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:35,590
Someone horizon...

2906
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,590
Someone horizon ult in the middle of the square.

2907
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:38,470
Someone horizon...

2908
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:40,990
Wait, I'll say I DC'd.

2909
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:45,890
Oh yeah, me too.

2910
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:47,890
5 people DC'd, we have to restart now.

2911
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:49,590
Tempo, you should say it.

2912
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:50,990
They trust you more than my word.

2913
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:52,850
Yeah, you should be like...

2914
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:54,250
Don't comment.

2915
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:55,930
Bro.

2916
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:56,390
Bro.

2917
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,290
Trust me, bro.

2918
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:02,510
No, they're not.

2919
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,570
It just says that we're just gonna create a new code.

2920
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:09,410
Well, if the entire server crashes, that's a different story, right?

2921
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,030
If the game doesn't actually end.

2922
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:15,610
We just gotta hope it blows up in the next like...

2923
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:16,610
2-3 minutes.

2924
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,230
That's a lot of hope right now.

2925
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:21,910
Crash, crash, crash.

2926
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:24,230
Only 4 people DC'd.

2927
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:24,430
We're just connected.

2928
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:29,450
Yo, that's a solid...

2929
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:33,310
Wait, okay, but if you say...

2930
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:35,430
Tempo, you should tell them that you DC'd too.

2931
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,850
So then it adds a 5th person into it.

2932
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:39,850
No, no, no, you tell them.

2933
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:41,230
No, no, you tell them.

2934
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:43,050
I don't wanna get banned from Rivals.

2935
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:46,150
This punk.

2936
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:49,030
Yeah, but they can't ban you.

2937
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:51,550
They can't ban you.

2938
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:54,050
You're like the heart of Apex.

2939
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:54,410
You're like the heart of Apex.

2940
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:55,250
Oh my god.

2941
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:59,050
Dude, I wasn't even invited normally.

2942
01:42:59,230 --> 01:42:59,670
What do you mean?

2943
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:03,050
Someone said in my chat, unplug Hal, then they'll restart.

2944
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:05,170
Someone said in my chat, unplug Hal, then they'll restart.

2945
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:05,550
Oh no.

2946
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:08,230
This seems to be his internet connection.

2947
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:12,450
Oh my god, Hal just needs to DC and then they'll restart the server.

2948
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:15,690
Oh my god, Hal just needs to DC and then they'll restart the server.

2949
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:16,990
Oh, this is going too quick.

2950
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:18,670
We need people to DC.

2951
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:21,010
I know, I don't think they're gonna restart.

2952
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:22,370
Too many people have died already.

2953
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:26,690
Come on server, go boom.

2954
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:29,930
Yeah, people are like, alright, fine.

2955
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:31,370
They've accepted it.

2956
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:38,290
To be fair, to be fair, Verhulst's team is doing really well for having only two people.

2957
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:43,130
Like, literally, he literally got six kills.

2958
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:48,650
Oh my god, he's literally the only person in this team that's getting kills right now.

2959
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:49,290
That's crazy.

2960
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:52,490
That's mean, there's only one other person on his team.

2961
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:56,410
Yeah, but like...

2962
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:03,430
And he got all the kills with P20 and Scout.

2963
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:06,030
Yeah, so he has 12 points.

2964
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:09,590
That's crazy.

2965
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:11,970
Mac, plug in your controller.

2966
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:20,430
Mac, why did you go back to MNK?

2967
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:21,290
What the fuck?

2968
01:44:21,610 --> 01:44:23,510
Because he knew aim assist nerf was coming.

2969
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:26,550
Oh my god.

2970
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:28,430
He's like, suck it bitches, I'm back on movement.

2971
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:28,710
How did you know?

2972
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,090
Who leaked it to you?

2973
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:32,730
That's illegal.

2974
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:35,850
Insider trading.

2975
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:36,810
Yeah.

2976
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:41,110
Can't believe you went back to MNK.

2977
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:44,770
It's such a shocker.

2978
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:45,290
Wow.

2979
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:49,230
Don't worry.

2980
01:44:49,410 --> 01:44:51,390
In the next year, you'll go back to controller.

2981
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:52,650
Yep.

2982
01:44:53,490 --> 01:44:54,710
It's gonna be a pattern.

2983
01:44:55,070 --> 01:45:00,410
Oh yeah, didn't they do the controller overclocking thingy just now too?

2984
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:01,270
What's that?

2985
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:02,290
Oh.

2986
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,570
What's that?

2987
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:07,130
You can hack your controller.

2988
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:10,070
Yeah.

2989
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,770
Oh shit, and you left...

2990
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,770
And you left controller?

2991
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:15,710
It's not good.

2992
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:17,950
Wait, okay, Tempo.

2993
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:20,590
But how did they do that?

2994
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:21,990
I have no clue.

2995
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:32,130
Basically, one of their controller sponsors, like their primary controller sponsor, made an overclocking software so now it's considered a first party software.

2996
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:33,770
Is that bad?

2997
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:41,450
Wait, does that mean everyone who's playing ALGS, if they want to overclock, they have to use a battle beaver?

2998
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:43,490
Wait, is it battle beaver?

2999
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:44,430
That did it?

3000
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:44,870
Yeah, it does.

3001
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:47,490
Oh, and is there newer controllers that does it?

3002
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:48,950
No, it's all their rollers.

3003
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:51,050
Oh, because it's like a software?

3004
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,550
You can overclock a base PS4 or PS5.

3005
01:45:52,570 --> 01:45:53,450
Yeah, it's a software.

3006
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:55,970
Let me grab my battle beaver real quick.

3007
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:59,870
Let me switch to my controller real quick.

3008
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:05,370
Let me switch to my controller real quick.

3009
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:07,750
So you're saying...

3010
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:09,390
So what does overclocking do?

3011
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,710
Wait, I also have a battle beaver.

3012
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:16,410
It basically increases the responsiveness of your roller.

3013
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:18,510
It's like polling rate on mice.

3014
01:46:19,290 --> 01:46:21,370
You're overclocking the polling rate on your controller.

3015
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:25,430
Wait, where does it show my polling rate on my mouse?

3016
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,750
So you're saying...

3017
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,450
is that...

3018
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:34,870
I am at...

3019
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:36,510
That's not DPI, right?

3020
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:40,450
It's not cheating because it's part of the roller.

3021
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:42,570
Wait, can I...

3022
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:43,530
Where's my polling rate?

3023
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:45,970
Well, actually...

3024
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:48,090
It's not...

3025
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:51,530
Apparently it's not overclocking the roller itself.

3026
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:55,530
It's overclocking the USB hub or some shit.

3027
01:46:56,730 --> 01:47:00,070
Oh, so you can still do it and use other controllers, I guess?

3028
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:00,910
Yeah.

3029
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:03,630
So...

3030
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:04,110
Team 7.

3031
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:06,950
Okay, so it's Janja's team.

3032
01:47:07,850 --> 01:47:08,430
Damn.

3033
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,310
Team 9 is Zap.

3034
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:14,050
Wait, where's team 15 and...

3035
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:15,010
Team 9 is Zap?

3036
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:16,550
Where's team 15 and 5?

3037
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:20,130
15 got 15th and 0.

3038
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:27,730
Team 5 got 17th but 7 killed.

3039
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:30,790
We didn't know we're team 8.

3040
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:32,510
Team 5 made it out of the negatives.

3041
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:34,490
We did it.

3042
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:35,750
I'm so proud of them.

3043
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:37,810
Team 15 is still in the negatives.

3044
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:39,550
Okay.

3045
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:40,570
Oh, no way, no way.

3046
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:41,630
They're at 0 points now.

3047
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:42,710
Yeah, they got out.

3048
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:43,910
I'm proud of them.

3049
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:45,310
Holy shit.

3050
01:47:46,570 --> 01:47:48,230
Does the Twitch Rivals...

3051
01:47:48,230 --> 01:47:52,050
Does the Twitch Rivals not give scores at all?

3052
01:47:52,710 --> 01:47:53,550
They said they are.

3053
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:56,090
I just smacked a fly out of the air with my mouse.

3054
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:59,450
Guys, is Twitch Rivals giving scores out on their stream?

3055
01:47:59,770 --> 01:48:00,170
Or like...

3056
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:03,150
Because we're not getting the scores at all.

3057
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:06,030
That's why Hal went in to ask us what the scores are.

3058
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,530
That's why Hal went in to ask us what the scores are.

3059
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:10,210
I switched to a fly.

3060
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:11,530
A fly with my mousepad.

3061
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:13,850
Are there like...

3062
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,670
fucking guts on your...

3063
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:16,670
I'm going to disappear for a sec.

3064
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:18,890
A fly with my mouse, not my mousepad.

3065
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:20,450
Wait, does that mean you're going to disappear?

3066
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:23,650
Does that mean there's like guts...

3067
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:25,430
There's guts on your mousepad now?

3068
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:26,650
I have no clue.

3069
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:28,470
Oh, wait, the scores are up.

3070
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:31,490
I just don't know how many games this is in.

3071
01:48:31,690 --> 01:48:32,470
We're in game 3.

3072
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:34,650
We just finished game 3.

3073
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:38,050
Okay, the scores are up for only 2 games.

3074
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:39,550
Like after 2 games.

3075
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:40,490
Oh, I see.

3076
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:43,410
I see.

3077
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:45,430
Wait, why do we only have 5 points?

3078
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:46,310
Wait, what?

3079
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:49,030
What?

3080
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:51,490
We got 15 kills.

3081
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:53,410
Do they not count kills in Revives?

3082
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:54,970
I don't know.

3083
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:56,670
But...

3084
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:58,110
But...

3085
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:01,110
This next game...

3086
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:03,190
On Storm Point...

3087
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:05,750
Boosted Gun is Alternator Charge Rifle.

3088
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:08,130
Hey, that's your gun.

3089
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:09,130
Oh, boy.

3090
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:10,650
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

3091
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:12,870
Wait, they don't count kills on the first game?

3092
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:14,610
That's fucked!

3093
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,270
Wait, really?

3094
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:17,610
I don't know!

3095
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:19,710
He said we got 5 points in 2 games.

3096
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:20,870
It said...

3097
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:24,250
I'm pretty sure they just didn't include the kills yet.

3098
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:27,270
Because it says you still get 1 point per kill.

3099
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:30,110
I'm so confused.

3100
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:32,090
Blah, blah, blah.

3101
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:33,230
Format, blah, blah, blah.

3102
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:39,110
Each map will have a set of feature wins that will award extra points for a kill.

3103
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:41,090
What?

3104
01:49:41,230 --> 01:49:42,550
You get extra points for a kill.

3105
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:44,650
But you still get points for a normal kill.

3106
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:49,450
Each kill, only in Standard Battle Royale, equals 1 point.

3107
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:50,010
Where?

3108
01:49:51,950 --> 01:49:55,130
It says it under the scoring.

3109
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:56,450
Replacement.

3110
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:58,470
In format.

3111
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:00,790
Oh my god!

3112
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:01,810
What?

3113
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:04,490
So kills in Revival don't matter?

3114
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:06,270
Why the fuck are people killing?

3115
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:08,110
No.

3116
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:09,730
Why the fuck are people killing?

3117
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:12,270
We're making up with kills in this game.

3118
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:13,430
We're griefing people.

3119
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:15,070
Wait, where does that say it?

3120
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:16,750
I just found it.

3121
01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:19,310
Guys.

3122
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:19,790
Mac.

3123
01:50:21,030 --> 01:50:22,390
We're not reading rules again.

3124
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:23,870
This is Day Shop.

3125
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,390
We're doing it again, Mac!

3126
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:26,670
Wait, what do you mean again?

3127
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:28,490
Did this happen to you guys last time?

3128
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:30,590
Wait, wait, wait.

3129
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:33,090
Alter, Rev.

3130
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:35,390
And part Newcastle.

3131
01:50:35,450 --> 01:50:37,650
We didn't read the rules again!

3132
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:51,290
Not again.

3133
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:54,590
That's so funny.

3134
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:56,030
But

3135
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:03,740
the else is reading the rules because everyone is sending two people out to get kills!

3136
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:04,760
Everyone!

3137
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,360
Oh no.

3138
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:08,640
Alright, well.

3139
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,900
We can make up for kills with this game.

3140
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,700
You should have known this.

3141
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,320
I blame you.

3142
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,140
You're the format guy.

3143
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:16,140
You should have known this.

3144
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:19,160
You let us astray.

3145
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,360
It'd be weird.

3146
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:20,640
Don't worry.

3147
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,460
This is why people have so little kills.

3148
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:25,720
I'll make up with 10 charge rifle kills here, which is 20 kills.

3149
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:25,980
Alright?

3150
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:26,440
Don't worry.

3151
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:28,100
Okay, so like.

3152
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,480
What do we play?

3153
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:31,160
Alter, Rev.

3154
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:32,760
Bloodseer.

3155
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,120
Caustic, Rampart.

3156
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,280
Gibby, Newcastle.

3157
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:36,020
Okay, Mac.

3158
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:36,660
What do we play?

3159
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,040
We need placements.

3160
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:41,120
I got Rampart.

3161
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:41,180
Alright.

3162
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:43,900
Uh.

3163
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:47,740
Uh.

3164
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:52,360
There's no group moving character.

3165
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:52,880
There's no group moving character.

3166
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,560
These cops are fucking awful.

3167
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:55,920
Yeah, there's no group moving character.

3168
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:58,100
This is so cursed what I'm looking at, man.

3169
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:02,020
My brain is trying so hard to like formulate something.

3170
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:03,920
Rampart, Newcastle.

3171
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,740
You just build Fortnite.

3172
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:07,080
Yeah, I think we have to build a motel.

3173
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:08,680
With Rampart, Newcastle.

3174
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,140
And then...

3175
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,820
And then we should probably get a recon scan, right?

3176
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:13,040
Caustic?

3177
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:17,100
Wait, Caustic, Rampart, Newcastle?

3178
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:17,320
Wait, Caustic, Rampart, Newcastle?

3179
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:18,260
Yeah.

3180
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,560
So which one do I play?

3181
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,840
Which one do you want to play?

3182
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,340
I'm good with any.

3183
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,620
Except for Rampart.

3184
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,440
Probably Caustic.

3185
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:27,220
Okay, I got this.

3186
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,880
I have Santa Claus Caustic too.

3187
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:32,360
So I'm going to give Christmas cheer.

3188
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:35,300
Oh, yo.

3189
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,320
We just build a Fortnite.

3190
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:39,300
Yeah, that's what they've been doing to us.

3191
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,340
That's what we're going to do.

3192
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:41,580
We're going to play three charge rifles.

3193
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,740
We're going to build a hotel.

3194
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,300
And we're going to cyber bully the lobby.

3195
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:48,700
Okay, we just got to have good zone prediction.

3196
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:51,380
Which I'm pretty sure Matt can do for us.

3197
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,400
Let me just...

3198
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,840
Wait, what if...

3199
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:56,040
There we go.

3200
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:57,560
Okay, what are you cooking?

3201
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:59,620
What if...

3202
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:01,060
You see my reply in chat?

3203
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:03,680
What if we play...

3204
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,320
Newcastle, Gibby, Rampart?

3205
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,320
Newcastle, Gibby, Rampart.

3206
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:10,580
Newcastle, Gibby, Rampart.

3207
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,180
So you would be Gibby then, Doggy.

3208
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,560
Okay, I will be Gibby.

3209
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:16,900
Or Mac.

3210
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,560
Or Mac.

3211
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,220
What do I do?

3212
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:24,080
They're both crucial roles.

3213
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:26,540
I don't know which one is more important.

3214
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,160
I don't know which one is more important.

3215
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:30,240
Now we'll be on the important one, right?

3216
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,400
Yeah, you'll play Gibby.

3217
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,360
I'll play Gibby?

3218
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:34,660
Okay.

3219
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:38,140
Wait, why?

3220
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:38,520
Wait, why?

3221
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,940
Didn't you get a kill with a Scout or a P20 last game?

3222
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:43,740
No.

3223
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,180
I shot somebody with a Spitfire.

3224
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:48,040
Oh wait, yeah, Spitfire...

3225
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,020
Was Spitfire not the gun?

3226
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,520
No, it was Scout or P20.

3227
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,800
What was the boosted gun again?

3228
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,400
Charge Rifle Alternator.

3229
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:57,680
Charge Rifle Alternator.

3230
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,040
Okay, I'll grab the Alternator.

3231
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:02,020
I'm going to be honest, I'm probably going to play with a shotgun.

3232
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:02,920
Okay.

3233
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,680
And just ignore the bonus points.

3234
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,000
I'll get us the bonus points.

3235
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,620
Yeah, I'll get Alternator.

3236
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,360
And then, yeah, I can't do a Charge Rifle.

3237
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,460
No, you have to.

3238
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,400
You have to.

3239
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:15,760
I can!

3240
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:16,220
I can!

3241
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,940
No, you're doing it.

3242
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,480
I don't care if you think you can't.

3243
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:22,880
You will.

3244
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,200
Guys, I just chat.

3245
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:29,660
And you guys should know, Tempo's Charge Rifle level is 87.

3246
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:32,180
Yes, I fucking see it.

3247
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:39,520
I fucking see this cursed shit right now that you fucking showed everybody else in the next chat.

3248
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:40,500
I'm coming.

3249
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,500
I'm coming for everyone.

3250
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:43,260
Everyone's going to die.

3251
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:47,080
This is Tempo's fucking Charge Rifle stats.

3252
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:49,740
I forgot where I said we were going.

3253
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,400
Um, me too.

3254
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:53,140
Dome.

3255
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:54,620
Oh wait, Storm Point?

3256
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,540
Oh shit, Mel!

3257
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:57,100
Mel, Mel, Mel.

3258
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:58,300
No, I said Zeus.

3259
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,140
I changed it.

3260
01:54:59,200 --> 01:54:59,840
Oh, Zeus, okay.

3261
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:02,540
Wait, we landed Hotstone.

3262
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,600
Yes, we did.

3263
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,060
And we got two points.

3264
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,140
One was the freebie and one was the kill.

3265
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:11,880
That's how we got our five.

3266
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,000
Guys, are we going to perform worse than with Vig on our team?

3267
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:17,440
If that happens...

3268
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,360
We're getting 20 points this game, so that'll boost us to what, 25?

3269
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:22,520
Hang on.

3270
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:25,380
Disaster striking, hang on.

3271
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:29,800
People are like arguing right now regarding point distribution.

3272
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:35,280
I feel like something is off.

3273
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,040
People are not happy.

3274
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:39,060
about the points distribution right now.

3275
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,600
I see a lot of arguing in chat.

3276
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:47,220
Someone said, Guy spent a third of his life trolling with charge rifle.

3277
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:47,860
That's tempo.

3278
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:49,200
Wait, what?

3279
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:53,880
You spent a third of your life just playing on chat.

3280
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:56,160
That's why I still have fun playing the game, alright?

3281
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:58,100
I only play to troll people.

3282
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:00,900
Yo, wait, wait, wait.

3283
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,120
Did people, did they give the players their minus points?

3284
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,580
If they didn't add the minus points, you can ask them.

3285
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo.

3286
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:12,800
Yo, where are the minus fives at?

3287
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:14,340
Homie.

3288
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:23,570
Okay, we may in fact

3289
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:29,970
I might have a plan.

3290
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,470
I want to see a negative point team after six games.

3291
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:33,750
Damn.

3292
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:35,350
That's fucked.

3293
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:43,590
At least that means like, you know, they'll still they can still get money even with negative points.

3294
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:46,590
We will be Coastal Camp, I think.

3295
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:48,690
Okay.

3296
01:56:48,970 --> 01:56:49,230
Okay.

3297
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:49,790
Doesn't matter.

3298
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:52,090
Oh wait, doesn't Coastal Camp have the thingy with the charge rifle?

3299
01:56:52,730 --> 01:56:54,070
Yes, it has a sniper tower.

3300
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:55,950
That's specifically why I'm picking it.

3301
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:57,530
Oh yeah, baby.

3302
01:56:57,850 --> 01:57:00,650
So that we have a good chance of getting a charge rifle.

3303
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:00,690
Oh yeah, baby.

3304
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:08,520
I believe in us.

3305
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:09,280
There's no way.

3306
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,240
We're gonna break ten points, right?

3307
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,080
Yeah.

3308
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:13,520
Guys.

3309
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,100
We're gonna get hot zone on Coastal.

3310
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:16,840
I'll be right back.

3311
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,120
Where's the thingy?

3312
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:22,180
Is there no They didn't do it.

3313
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,940
Oh, no hotspot landing for this one.

3314
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:24,760
Oh, okay.

3315
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:26,620
Wait, did Mac pick his character?

3316
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:28,980
That's a very good question.

3317
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:29,960
Uh oh.

3318
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,860
Maybe if I leave, they won't start.

3319
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,240
You picked yours though, right?

3320
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:36,260
Yeah, yeah.

3321
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:36,820
Gibby.

3322
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:39,720
Someone in my chat said he did not.

3323
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,240
Oh.

3324
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:44,200
Guys, as soon as your countdown, I'll leave the game.

3325
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:46,180
So they'll have to...

3326
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:46,300
Mac?

3327
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:46,940
Mac?

3328
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,040
Mac is in bathroom.

3329
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,280
Oh, my God.

3330
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:53,160
He better pee fast.

3331
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,000
Oh, my God.

3332
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,640
I've been making fun of negative five teams this whole time.

3333
01:57:58,720 --> 01:57:59,640
This is karma.

3334
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:00,780
This is literally karma.

3335
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:06,340
Oh, no.

3336
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:07,880
Leaderboard.

3337
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:09,980
Leaderboard is total scores.

3338
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,800
Hotspot detailed is raw points.

3339
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,400
Hotspot detailed is raw points.

3340
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:16,580
Hotspot detailed is raw points.

3341
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:17,420
What does hotspot mean?

3342
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:19,740
Oh, he's back.

3343
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:20,800
Oh, thank God.

3344
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:22,140
Oh.

3345
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:24,200
Wait.

3346
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,200
Okay, so leaderboard is total...

3347
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:29,760
What did he just say?

3348
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,920
Hotspot details is raw points.

3349
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:36,320
Hotspot is if you landed in the hotspot.

3350
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:37,200
Hotspot is if you landed in the hotspot.

3351
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,180
So we have to have six points.

3352
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,740
Because we landed in the hotspot once, right?

3353
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:40,400
I'm getting water.

3354
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:43,520
I reselected path.

3355
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,080
Why is my chat gaslighting me?

3356
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,400
It's okay.

3357
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,680
Team six is missing someone.

3358
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:48,280
So we're good.

3359
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,580
Why is Ruby of all people gaslighting me?

3360
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,720
That was the coach.

3361
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,180
Why am I being gaslit by my coach?

3362
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:00,500
All right.

3363
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,520
I'm back.

3364
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,800
Is everything good for you guys?

3365
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:09,900
Oh, we're starting.

3366
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,780
We're about to shotgun a Red Bull.

3367
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,000
For the charge rifle of the century.

3368
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:15,700
Jesus Christ.

3369
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,480
I'm drinking water.

3370
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,420
You're fucking shotgunning a Red Bull.

3371
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:23,520
Okay.

3372
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:24,740
I'm ready.

3373
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:25,860
Jesus Christ.

3374
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:29,000
My face is now in my screen.

3375
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:30,280
Oh my God.

3376
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:32,020
I'm ready to charge rifle, people.

3377
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:36,460
I'll take a bite out of my wrap.

3378
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,900
I now look like Zero with my face in my monitor.

3379
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,080
He won the World Cup.

3380
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:43,980
No, they got second.

3381
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,020
Oh, yeah.

3382
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:46,340
Because I missed a bunch of Kraber shots.

3383
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:47,060
Oh, yeah.

3384
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,160
I almost forgot.

3385
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:51,980
Wait.

3386
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,260
I can't see a lot if I'm this close to the monitor.

3387
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,360
Embo, pick your character.

3388
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,400
It's Rampart, right?

3389
01:59:57,820 --> 01:59:58,220
Yeah.

3390
01:59:58,520 --> 01:59:58,920
Okay.

3391
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,300
I also forgot.

3392
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:05,660
You know that I freaked out, Doki.

3393
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:07,480
I also didn't remember.

3394
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:08,500
She was like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

3395
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,680
Well, that Gibby skin is fire.

3396
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:11,860
Got the camo drip.

3397
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:12,320
That's right.

3398
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:13,620
They can't see me if I'm camouflage.

3399
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:14,760
You will be in a tree.

3400
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:17,520
Can't see me if I'm hiding in a tree.

3401
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,280
Yeah, they'll just think she's a coconut.

3402
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,700
Definitely not a Gibby.

3403
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:27,620
If we kill someone, they'll see my banner and they'll see level 87 charge rifle and then I'll teabag them.

3404
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:28,440
Just don't die.

3405
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:31,060
Bad news, my mouse died.

3406
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,500
I have to play Wired.

3407
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:39,600
Heck, why didn't you fucking charge your mouse right now?

3408
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,360
My mouse isn't working.

3409
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,180
No, it's just in game.

3410
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,500
My mouse actually isn't dead.

3411
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:44,300
Oh, shit.

3412
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:48,040
You gotta alt F4 and then rejoin the game.

3413
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:50,080
That happened to me.

3414
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,360
I had to restart my game completely.

3415
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:54,940
I had to alt tab.

3416
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:56,580
Thank god I didn't listen to Tempo.

3417
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,940
I didn't listen to this guy.

3418
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,640
It didn't work when I alt tabbed.

3419
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,720
Holy shit.

3420
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:05,960
I'm glad you like...

3421
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:07,680
I'm glad you doubted it.

3422
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:12,300
Even if you alt F4 and restarted, we would have just landed at Coastal by the time you got in.

3423
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:16,120
Shit.

3424
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:19,740
I think I have the fucking sword heirloom equipped on this guy.

3425
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,520
Look, Evan told me how to fly.

3426
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:23,400
Look at this fucking fuuuu...

3427
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,760
perfect flight path.

3428
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,240
Where do we even loot?

3429
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:30,220
All I know is I'm going on that triangle thingy.

3430
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:31,720
I'm right here.

3431
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,120
I have Evan flying.

3432
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:34,900
I have skills.

3433
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,520
I got my charge rifle.

3434
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:40,980
Let me know you find an alternator.

3435
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:47,130
There's like four wingmans here.

3436
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:47,870
What the fuck?

3437
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,310
That shit's fucked.

3438
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:54,470
I'm going to play charge rifle Mastiff.

3439
02:01:56,170 --> 02:01:57,970
Imagine zone ends here.

3440
02:01:58,050 --> 02:01:59,670
Nevermind, it's already picked up.

3441
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:04,890
I'm still trying to find my I'm still trying to find my alternator.

3442
02:02:06,190 --> 02:02:07,750
Oh, I found my alternator.

3443
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:10,090
North pad zone?

3444
02:02:12,250 --> 02:02:12,850
Let's see.

3445
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:15,570
Is there another charge rifle up there?

3446
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:17,090
No, there's only one.

3447
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:17,870
There's a sniper stock here.

3448
02:02:19,150 --> 02:02:20,550
Only one charge rifle up there.

3449
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:21,810
Hey, here's another one.

3450
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,530
Found one.

3451
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:25,890
I have one, yeah.

3452
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:28,770
I'm not going to run it because I don't know how to use it.

3453
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:30,870
Alright, this is already looted.

3454
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:31,610
Okay.

3455
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:34,090
Actually, not that much loot over here.

3456
02:02:34,230 --> 02:02:36,910
I stopped using charge rifle when they made it worse.

3457
02:02:38,110 --> 02:02:39,270
When they made it harder?

3458
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:39,970
Yeah.

3459
02:02:41,730 --> 02:02:42,870
I tapped out just like that.

3460
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:46,010
I'm not here to learn.

3461
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:51,790
I'm here to plateau.

3462
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:55,610
I need a six or a four eights.

3463
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:00,120
Alright, cappy ten.

3464
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:00,960
Lead us.

3465
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:04,400
To the promised land.

3466
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:07,060
We're going this way.

3467
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:10,040
Let's get out of here.

3468
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:10,440
Alright.

3469
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:12,820
Alright.

3470
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:15,600
Our goal is to break ten points in the end.

3471
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:18,680
Barometer is coming up.

3472
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,460
If we don't break ten points, man...

3473
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:24,580
If we don't break ten points, our team is worse than when Wig is on our team.

3474
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,800
I don't know if I can...

3475
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:27,900
No.

3476
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,680
If the charge rifle is a bonus gun, this is good.

3477
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:34,980
I'm just grabbing this Eva.

3478
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:38,020
When he scans the beacon, I'm going to shoot his ass off.

3479
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:38,640
Okay.

3480
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:42,840
What should I get?

3481
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:44,600
Do I get shots, shots, shots, refresh...

3482
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:45,520
Oh, revive allies, right?

3483
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:47,080
He is not scanning the beacon.

3484
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:49,740
You can take the revive if you want.

3485
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:50,780
Yeah, I'll do that.

3486
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:53,400
It depends if you're running a shotgun.

3487
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:55,580
If you're not running a shotgun, then don't take shot shots.

3488
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,300
Let's go.

3489
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,380
We're going this way, boys.

3490
02:03:58,960 --> 02:03:59,360
Alright.

3491
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:01,160
Alright.

3492
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:03,200
They just scanned us, by the way, so they know we're here.

3493
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,060
It's probably fine.

3494
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:06,140
Okay.

3495
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:07,380
I trust you.

3496
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:10,240
Questionable.

3497
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:11,480
Okay.

3498
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,380
You're making me doubt my choices.

3499
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,340
They're holding us.

3500
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:19,980
Where?

3501
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:21,840
Oh, there.

3502
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,780
I think I'm going to hold over there and shoot for you guys.

3503
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:26,820
Flesh!

3504
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:28,560
Oh, I can't shoot through the fucking fence?

3505
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:30,420
I ulted over.

3506
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,320
I'm going to shot from back, too.

3507
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,140
I cracked one here.

3508
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:36,060
I'm going to bat.

3509
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:37,860
Almost knocked one.

3510
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:39,880
Rev is sliding up on you guys.

3511
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:40,420
You guys should kill that guy.

3512
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:41,940
He's there alone.

3513
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:42,960
He's completely alone on that rock.

3514
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:45,060
I'm reloading.

3515
02:04:45,860 --> 02:04:46,580
He's close to you.

3516
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:47,820
He's in front of me.

3517
02:04:52,030 --> 02:04:52,870
Flesh, I cracked him.

3518
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:53,390
I cracked him.

3519
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:55,990
They're going to push now.

3520
02:04:57,530 --> 02:04:57,750
Okay.

3521
02:04:57,810 --> 02:04:59,170
Well, I cracked the other dude.

3522
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:00,370
Wait, I thought Tempo... what?

3523
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:01,870
I thought you guys took it.

3524
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:03,310
Tempo ran away.

3525
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:03,830
I don't know.

3526
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:07,690
I said to kill that guy and Tempo was like, I'm going the other way.

3527
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:09,430
I thought we were all running to you.

3528
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:12,690
He said to kill the Revenant that was on you because he was alone.

3529
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:14,290
And you just left her alone.

3530
02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:15,630
It's okay.

3531
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:16,350
We can craft her.

3532
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:18,430
I heard the call!

3533
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,470
Just completely abandoned her.

3534
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:23,850
I definitely did not hear that.

3535
02:05:25,130 --> 02:05:25,490
What?

3536
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:26,770
What do you mean you didn't?

3537
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:28,630
I was just following arrows.

3538
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:31,130
I will admit, he probably said it.

3539
02:05:31,550 --> 02:05:33,170
I definitely did.

3540
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:34,170
That's why she's dead.

3541
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:37,350
I would have ran back!

3542
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:39,750
Okay, I'm just as airheaded as Doggy.

3543
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:40,250
So we're good.

3544
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:42,310
I listened to the call!

3545
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:44,270
What call?

3546
02:05:47,450 --> 02:05:49,730
Oh my god, it could have been a lie.

3547
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:50,910
All I know is...

3548
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:51,990
We can craft her.

3549
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:53,290
Somewhere.

3550
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:55,950
Wait, we can't craft her.

3551
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:57,010
Where are all the crafters?

3552
02:05:57,010 --> 02:05:58,210
There's a crafter here.

3553
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:00,730
I can't believe it.

3554
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:02,550
I can't believe it.

3555
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:07,190
I can't believe you did tell me to back off after Tempo did it.

3556
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:10,910
I didn't even realize that he just ignored the comm completely.

3557
02:06:11,090 --> 02:06:13,690
I looked to my left and I was like, oh there's Tempo running past me.

3558
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:15,750
As you were dead.

3559
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:16,330
I'm here guys!

3560
02:06:18,970 --> 02:06:20,270
Mack, maybe you were right.

3561
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:22,370
Maybe I should have got the fire dragon guy.

3562
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:23,270
Okay.

3563
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:25,210
Don't worry.

3564
02:06:26,590 --> 02:06:28,410
It's all going according to plan.

3565
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:29,890
What, me dying?

3566
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:31,170
That's part of the plan?

3567
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:32,410
What plan is it?

3568
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:33,770
You're a sacrificial part of our rotate.

3569
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:35,710
I hope.

3570
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:44,090
Oh my god, I hope there's nobody there.

3571
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:47,970
Don't worry, everyone already rotated to zone.

3572
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:55,850
I like how my chat was like, Tempo replaces auditory sensors with score tracking.

3573
02:06:58,850 --> 02:06:59,350
Hey!

3574
02:06:59,550 --> 02:07:01,890
The game doesn't have audio to begin with, okay?

3575
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:03,030
I don't need auditory sensors.

3576
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:05,450
And even then, the score tracking wasn't even accurate.

3577
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:06,570
That's the worst part.

3578
02:07:06,850 --> 02:07:10,170
The score tracking was so inaccurate because we didn't read the rules.

3579
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:12,970
That's a...

3580
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:15,090
I blame Doki for that one.

3581
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:16,230
How do you blame me?

3582
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:18,150
I gave captain to...

3583
02:07:20,270 --> 02:07:21,410
I pawned off my captain.

3584
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:23,230
Imagine if I accidentally crafted a wrong thing.

3585
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:24,510
Did you actually?

3586
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:26,630
I'm raising you up here.

3587
02:07:26,770 --> 02:07:27,210
Come this way.

3588
02:07:29,490 --> 02:07:30,450
Is that a person?

3589
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:32,510
Am I tweaking?

3590
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:33,110
I'm tweaking.

3591
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:36,530
Guys, apparently the fire dragon guy is first place.

3592
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:39,810
What?

3593
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:43,870
Not to say that Tempo wasn't the best choice.

3594
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,150
Don't worry, we could be first place.

3595
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:47,770
Wait, what about Zap?

3596
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:48,750
What about Zap's team?

3597
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:51,070
We don't need to worry about that.

3598
02:07:51,110 --> 02:07:52,530
Our placement is Zap's team.

3599
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:58,070
Let's waddle on over here.

3600
02:07:58,090 --> 02:07:58,850
You said there's a team up here?

3601
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:00,890
All the way up at command, yeah.

3602
02:08:01,230 --> 02:08:02,870
I got shot at while landing.

3603
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:04,550
But behind me.

3604
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:07,190
I might be dead here.

3605
02:08:07,550 --> 02:08:08,470
I mean from above.

3606
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:10,290
You're probably okay.

3607
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,390
I don't feel okay.

3608
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:16,110
You're probably fine.

3609
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:17,070
It's just anxiety.

3610
02:08:17,730 --> 02:08:18,610
Don't worry doggy.

3611
02:08:19,330 --> 02:08:20,750
That's just everyday life for me.

3612
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:21,390
I'm right behind you.

3613
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:26,890
No, that's not anxiety because I feel that every day.

3614
02:08:28,130 --> 02:08:30,030
Someone just flew in here on the right.

3615
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,370
Maybe we just chill over here and build a little hotel.

3616
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:34,250
Yeah, let's just start building.

3617
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:37,150
There's probably someone here, but we'll find out.

3618
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:40,030
Who the fuck be flying?

3619
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:41,170
Someone's flying in in front of us.

3620
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:43,170
I hit the Gibby.

3621
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:45,710
This flew in in front of us.

3622
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:46,210
Okay.

3623
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:48,210
That's probably fine.

3624
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:51,750
I'm gonna grab some meds after all this.

3625
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:52,170
They're trying to evac.

3626
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:53,750
Oh shit, okay.

3627
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:55,790
I'm waiting for the balloon to go up.

3628
02:08:56,090 --> 02:08:57,910
Yeah, tempo, get Sheila out.

3629
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:59,470
Shoot the last one.

3630
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:00,950
Where's the last one?

3631
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:04,950
I hit something and then I know where it is.

3632
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:05,870
I can't stand this guy.

3633
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:08,250
Wait, the last one already left?

3634
02:09:08,330 --> 02:09:09,990
I was charge rifling them.

3635
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,030
I can't stand this guy.

3636
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:13,210
Wait, I'm lagging.

3637
02:09:13,550 --> 02:09:16,270
No, the server is fucked right now.

3638
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:17,570
Are we killing house here?

3639
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:19,970
I'll take the evac.

3640
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:21,270
Oh no, it's gonna disappear.

3641
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:24,090
It's a disaster.

3642
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:25,650
Guys, I think...

3643
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:28,570
Are we lagging?

3644
02:09:28,590 --> 02:09:29,890
The server is lagging right now.

3645
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:31,210
Are you lagging too, Mac?

3646
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:32,370
Yeah.

3647
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:35,290
I guess we build a house here.

3648
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:36,690
We build a house, yeah.

3649
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:40,050
No wonder I no-regged.

3650
02:09:40,170 --> 02:09:41,370
Okay, that made more sense.

3651
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:45,650
I heard hit register shots.

3652
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:48,250
Are we farming the spiders or nah?

3653
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:49,490
Yeah, yeah.

3654
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:51,190
And we got a care pack on us?

3655
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:53,530
This is auditory.

3656
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:55,870
This is really on and off.

3657
02:09:59,430 --> 02:10:02,570
They really did trade that for proper score tracking.

3658
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:03,230
What the fuck?

3659
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:06,630
It wasn't even accurate score tracking.

3660
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:10,370
Sniper stock here.

3661
02:10:10,530 --> 02:10:11,770
Why am I getting sniper shit?

3662
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:13,990
I need stuff for my gun.

3663
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:17,930
Oh, where?

3664
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:18,670
Tempo, build a house.

3665
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:19,970
Tempo, house.

3666
02:10:20,070 --> 02:10:22,850
I can only put, what, two more walls?

3667
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:25,590
Yeah, I'm chilling up here.

3668
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:27,370
My wall's not very good, I'm not gonna lie.

3669
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:29,750
How do I get a wall up there?

3670
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:30,590
I can't build anything.

3671
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:32,090
You don't.

3672
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:34,430
This is just a me thing.

3673
02:10:35,490 --> 02:10:36,450
Yo, there's a Devo.

3674
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:37,110
Someone take that.

3675
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:39,670
Mac's gonna take that, right?

3676
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:41,170
Uh...

3677
02:10:42,610 --> 02:10:43,450
I could.

3678
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:48,830
Mac, you are like, literally the only positive thing here in our team.

3679
02:10:50,170 --> 02:10:50,730
Shit.

3680
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:54,370
Who the fuck?

3681
02:10:56,230 --> 02:10:57,330
What the fuck?

3682
02:10:57,370 --> 02:10:58,550
Why were you stuck in there?

3683
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:01,050
Alright, we finished.

3684
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:04,090
Alright, you wanna play fucking Sheila battle?

3685
02:11:04,990 --> 02:11:05,550
No.

3686
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:11,750
Fuck your door, you son of a bitch!

3687
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:11,870
Fuck your door, you son of a bitch!

3688
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:15,590
They're fighting up here.

3689
02:11:15,690 --> 02:11:16,570
We're so fucked.

3690
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:18,390
We're so fucked.

3691
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:19,930
Please tell me he's not full dead.

3692
02:11:20,170 --> 02:11:20,810
He's not.

3693
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:23,270
But we might be.

3694
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:27,670
Tempo.

3695
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:29,290
I don't even know how you died.

3696
02:11:31,650 --> 02:11:32,510
They were cheating.

3697
02:11:32,910 --> 02:11:34,530
I don't even...

3698
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:37,150
Oh, fellas.

3699
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:38,690
This is not looking good.

3700
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:40,770
This is not looking good for us.

3701
02:11:40,830 --> 02:11:41,690
We don't have an evac.

3702
02:11:41,890 --> 02:11:42,970
We gotta just go around.

3703
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:44,030
This is fucked.

3704
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:47,390
Come this way.

3705
02:11:48,730 --> 02:11:49,610
We gotta...

3706
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:51,530
Tempo, hurry up.

3707
02:11:51,550 --> 02:11:52,110
Open your ears.

3708
02:11:52,150 --> 02:11:52,430
Let's go.

3709
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:55,150
We gotta fucking move, buddy.

3710
02:11:57,870 --> 02:11:59,190
Yo, five teams already died.

3711
02:11:59,250 --> 02:11:59,730
We got one point.

3712
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:01,150
Let's go.

3713
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:03,150
That should not be like...

3714
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,290
Let's fucking go, dude.

3715
02:12:05,290 --> 02:12:06,250
Easy money.

3716
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:06,770
You're so right.

3717
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:08,990
What would we do without you keeping score?

3718
02:12:10,530 --> 02:12:11,510
Come on, Tempo.

3719
02:12:14,430 --> 02:12:14,910
Battery?

3720
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:19,150
I'm so glad we had someone that's paying attention to our placement right now.

3721
02:12:19,730 --> 02:12:20,590
Yo, we got battery.

3722
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:23,630
Yeah, he's just constantly reminding me, like, we're doing awful.

3723
02:12:24,610 --> 02:12:28,650
He's just in my ear, just like, we have five points in four games.

3724
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:30,950
Someone's flying on us.

3725
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:32,510
Come on, hurry up, Tempo.

3726
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:33,510
I'm running.

3727
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:34,470
Keep moving.

3728
02:12:35,290 --> 02:12:35,770
Go ahead.

3729
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:37,490
Yeah.

3730
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:39,690
We just need to get far, far away from them.

3731
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:41,470
That's the goal.

3732
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:43,110
Okay.

3733
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:47,310
So what I'm thinking is, we grab this mythic bin in front of us to get another care pack.

3734
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:48,170
Someone just took it.

3735
02:12:48,190 --> 02:12:48,450
It's over.

3736
02:12:48,810 --> 02:12:49,210
Oh.

3737
02:12:50,910 --> 02:12:51,870
We're going this way.

3738
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:53,930
Come with me.

3739
02:12:54,090 --> 02:12:55,190
We're gonna go to the right.

3740
02:12:56,070 --> 02:12:56,470
Okay.

3741
02:12:57,670 --> 02:12:58,950
Yeah, Revenant just grabbed it.

3742
02:12:59,030 --> 02:12:59,470
He's about to zip up.

3743
02:12:59,490 --> 02:12:59,790
Maybe...

3744
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:01,290
I missed.

3745
02:13:01,950 --> 02:13:02,670
I missed again.

3746
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:03,770
He has red armor.

3747
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:05,090
In fact, he has red armor.

3748
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:05,510
Okay.

3749
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:06,650
We're gonna go under here.

3750
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:07,430
It's fine.

3751
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:07,750
Maybe.

3752
02:13:07,870 --> 02:13:10,270
If there's people under here, listen, it's gonna be a brawl.

3753
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:11,890
Is Riv a character?

3754
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:12,610
Pull up.

3755
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:13,310
Yeah, he is.

3756
02:13:13,930 --> 02:13:15,070
There's a barrel here.

3757
02:13:15,670 --> 02:13:16,390
This is fine.

3758
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:18,610
If there's people here, we're brawling.

3759
02:13:18,970 --> 02:13:19,370
Okay.

3760
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:25,070
He has red armor and I have blue.

3761
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:28,330
You know...

3762
02:13:29,410 --> 02:13:29,810
Yeah?

3763
02:13:30,130 --> 02:13:30,990
There's a Sierra in front of me.

3764
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:31,790
Or above us.

3765
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:33,210
It's above us.

3766
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:34,850
We build a house.

3767
02:13:34,910 --> 02:13:35,510
We build a house.

3768
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:36,150
We're playing Fortnite.

3769
02:13:37,110 --> 02:13:37,470
Yippee!

3770
02:13:41,330 --> 02:13:42,610
This is our little house.

3771
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:49,600
Just a little baby.

3772
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:51,400
Hey, we got top 10!

3773
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:52,360
They jumped on the right.

3774
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,600
Yep, I'm watching.

3775
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,260
Oh.

3776
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:55,880
Just you?

3777
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:00,240
Yeah.

3778
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:01,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3779
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:02,160
Okay.

3780
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:04,920
Oh, right there?

3781
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,000
I'm not gonna lie.

3782
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,160
I think I might run at that guy.

3783
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:10,280
Mac, could you just think about that again?

3784
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:11,660
Mac, just... okay.

3785
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:13,420
Okay.

3786
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:16,340
I made him walk away.

3787
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:18,800
I'm watching the other side.

3788
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:20,980
Can you shoot that guy up top?

3789
02:14:21,340 --> 02:14:22,620
I don't have an angle on that guy.

3790
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:23,880
Peek him then.

3791
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:24,580
Okay.

3792
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:26,540
I'm watching our back.

3793
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:29,080
I almost killed one.

3794
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:30,100
Alright.

3795
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:36,220
We need more walls if you can have some walls.

3796
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:36,580
We need more walls if you can have some walls.

3797
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:39,500
I'm trying to crawl back.

3798
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:40,120
Okay.

3799
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:43,500
Crawl into this.

3800
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:44,800
And then...

3801
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:46,720
They're gonna thirst me.

3802
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:47,380
Okay.

3803
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:49,900
There's just nothing we can do, man.

3804
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:50,880
Okay.

3805
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:52,620
Get out of there, Doki.

3806
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:53,300
Get out of there.

3807
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:55,240
Alright.

3808
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:56,640
Live on for us.

3809
02:14:57,980 --> 02:14:58,780
Live on.

3810
02:14:58,780 --> 02:14:59,960
Teppo, I'm gonna distract him.

3811
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:00,400
You live on.

3812
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:01,520
You live on.

3813
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,540
I'm gonna distract him.

3814
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:04,080
I'm distracting them, Teppo.

3815
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:04,320
Just run.

3816
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:04,400
Teppo, run.

3817
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:05,320
Stop running.

3818
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:05,960
You're not here.

3819
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:07,940
I forgot it's a seer.

3820
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:08,840
I forgot it's a seer.

3821
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:13,100
Teppo, I fucking sacrificed my life and you were gonna hide in it before I was a seer team.

3822
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,060
No, there's...

3823
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:26,840
I literally sacrificed my life and Teppo's like, I'm gonna hide.

3824
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:28,440
Alright, guys.

3825
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:31,340
New plan.

3826
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:33,280
New plan.

3827
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:33,900
Top seven?

3828
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:35,940
I can get top three?

3829
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:39,380
Yeah.

3830
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:40,160
Get some charge rifle kills?

3831
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:42,500
No, you got... just hide.

3832
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:45,180
You're literally the rat.

3833
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,320
Rat jam, rat jam.

3834
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:48,580
Oh shit, jam.

3835
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:49,980
You have to go that way.

3836
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:51,560
You can't turn back.

3837
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:52,400
You can't.

3838
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:53,740
Alright, you can't.

3839
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:56,480
Well, now you have to run in front of everybody.

3840
02:15:58,540 --> 02:15:58,980
Mother...

3841
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:04,020
Who the fuck can't keep us all around that side?

3842
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:07,720
If you lived for, like, literally one more second, we could've been top...

3843
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,700
We got rank six, I think.

3844
02:16:11,380 --> 02:16:13,920
This is the best placement we've ever got.

3845
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:27,740
Okay, Mac, in the future, I think, like, if you'd say, like, Doki and Teppo, you'll do this together, I will not listen to you.

3846
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,660
What do you mean?

3847
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:33,940
That initial death did not change anything.

3848
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:35,520
We would've still been where we were.

3849
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:37,200
It fucked our rotation!

3850
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:42,760
Our pacing was completely fucked the whole game.

3851
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:45,020
We had to play with nothing.

3852
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,660
I had no...

3853
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:50,420
I had no skill for anything.

3854
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:54,500
Oh my god.

3855
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:55,980
Is that Zap?

3856
02:16:56,120 --> 02:16:57,140
That's Zap.

3857
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:01,560
I don't think Zap ever had these issues.

3858
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:03,180
Alright, he's kicked off TSM for gatekeeping.

3859
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:12,120
It's okay, we're a vibes team.

3860
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:13,620
We're a vibes team.

3861
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:14,540
What do you mean?

3862
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:15,460
We're still in...

3863
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,200
top... top...

3864
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:19,860
Teppo, we got five points.

3865
02:17:20,180 --> 02:17:21,560
How are we top anything?

3866
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,060
How are we...

3867
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:27,100
Oh, because some people have negative points.

3868
02:17:27,740 --> 02:17:29,340
Yeah, that's just two of them.

3869
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:31,420
We're still in top 15.

3870
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:33,620
Otherwise, we'd really be in trouble.

3871
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:36,380
We're still in top 15.

3872
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:36,940
Don't worry.

3873
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:40,720
We're still in top 15.

3874
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:42,320
Wait, we need a new plan, guys.

3875
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:45,020
We need a new plan for a revival mode since kills don't matter.

3876
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:47,900
We just go... We just go zone.

3877
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,200
Just play zone.

3878
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:50,280
That's all that matters.

3879
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:51,120
We don't need kills.

3880
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:52,000
We just need zone.

3881
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:54,040
But we just need fast people.

3882
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:57,020
No, we just need to play as if we're in a tournament.

3883
02:17:58,040 --> 02:17:58,440
What?

3884
02:17:59,300 --> 02:17:59,860
What?

3885
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:03,400
We gotta play like a fucking zone comp.

3886
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:06,360
Yeah, just scan zone and run fast.

3887
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:11,040
We need two fast people and then one zone people.

3888
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:12,320
We need two fast people and then one zone people.

3889
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:12,900
We need two fast people and then one zone people.

3890
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:15,980
Okay, Mac, what do you think?

3891
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:18,980
Too fast, one zone.

3892
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,980
Too fast, one zone.

3893
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:22,100
Just be zooming.

3894
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,760
Yeah, I don't know.

3895
02:18:25,460 --> 02:18:26,980
What do you mean you don't know?

3896
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:28,420
What do you mean you don't know?

3897
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:29,760
What do you mean?

3898
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,380
I got nothing.

3899
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:31,900
What do you mean you got nothing?

3900
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:33,520
I'm stumped.

3901
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:35,220
I'm truly stumped.

3902
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,220
Just pretend that we're two people right now.

3903
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:39,560
Um...

3904
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:42,780
We don't even know what the legends we can play.

3905
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:45,320
That's why I'm stumped.

3906
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,700
It's not you guys.

3907
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,980
I'm stumped because I don't know about the characters.

3908
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:52,760
Alright, guys.

3909
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:55,780
Just so you guys know, next game is our last game.

3910
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:57,320
Huh?

3911
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:57,840
Is it?

3912
02:18:58,440 --> 02:18:59,720
Isn't this our fifth game?

3913
02:19:00,020 --> 02:19:01,140
No, this is four.

3914
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:02,460
We have two more.

3915
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,640
Feels like an eternity.

3916
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:08,920
Feels like I've been waiting way too long.

3917
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:10,680
It's like...

3918
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:15,560
I was happy for like one second.

3919
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:19,220
Got reminded that the suffering isn't over.

3920
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:23,200
Hey, we doubled our points at this game.

3921
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:24,860
I think.

3922
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:25,380
Almost.

3923
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:25,960
Maybe.

3924
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:26,980
Sort of.

3925
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:28,920
We didn't even get a kill.

3926
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:31,560
We got enough placement points.

3927
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:32,860
We just got placement points.

3928
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:33,580
We got seven points.

3929
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:34,840
That's like barely...

3930
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:35,660
Wait, I thought we got six.

3931
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:37,600
No, we got seventh.

3932
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:39,260
Oh, we got seven.

3933
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:42,480
I said if you lived for like one second longer, we would have been safe.

3934
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:44,420
Oh, wait.

3935
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,880
Six and seventh are the exact same points anyway.

3936
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,420
Oh, so it doesn't matter.

3937
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:52,760
Yeah, there you go.

3938
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:55,580
Alright, and how many points does that give us?

3939
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:56,560
Three.

3940
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:00,200
We're almost at ten points.

3941
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:00,940
Almost.

3942
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,600
We're almost at ten points, guys.

3943
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,740
If we break ten points, Mike, we would have done...

3944
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:07,880
Guys, does anyone...

3945
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:10,320
We got second next game and then we double our points.

3946
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:12,000
How many points did we get with Wig?

3947
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:14,260
Guys, I need to know.

3948
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:16,780
How many points did we get with Wig last Twitch Rivals?

3949
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:21,280
She blocked that out of her memory because trauma.

3950
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:24,500
Okay, do you remember how many points we got?

3951
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:26,520
Yeah, but I don't remember anything.

3952
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:28,900
I don't remember what I did yesterday, so...

3953
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:32,060
Oh, yeah, you remember you weren't drunk during ALGS?

3954
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:34,040
Oh, yeah, you remember you weren't drunk during ALGS?

3955
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:35,220
I said, I don't think.

3956
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:36,000
I said, I don't think.

3957
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:36,640
Alright.

3958
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,700
You don't think.

3959
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:44,840
Maybe I should've asked Max's opinion on Pool B.

3960
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,380
Wow!

3961
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:51,260
Alright, that's it.

3962
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:51,560
Alright, that's it.

3963
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,380
I'm gonna have to turn on my hacks.

3964
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:55,820
You're gonna turn on your hacks?

3965
02:20:56,060 --> 02:20:56,260
Alright.

3966
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:57,740
You're gonna prove me wrong?

3967
02:20:57,740 --> 02:20:59,000
You're gonna prove me...

3968
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,700
Oh,

3969
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,690
that team got fucked.

3970
02:21:07,550 --> 02:21:08,870
No, Johnny Price is gonna...

3971
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:09,330
Oh, nope.

3972
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,790
Nope.

3973
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:13,090
Oh my god, call up Destroyer.

3974
02:21:13,150 --> 02:21:13,330
Yeah.

3975
02:21:14,410 --> 02:21:15,290
Yeah, Destroyer.

3976
02:21:15,290 --> 02:21:19,310
Hey, can you crash the lobby if we die early?

3977
02:21:19,470 --> 02:21:20,010
Yeah, okay.

3978
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:21,210
No, what the fuck?

3979
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:23,430
Why'd you do that when you just installed hacks on your...

3980
02:21:24,650 --> 02:21:26,530
Gotta make it not suspicious.

3981
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:29,450
If he crashes the lobby, we have to play longer.

3982
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:31,150
That's even worse.

3983
02:21:35,530 --> 02:21:35,950
Alright.

3984
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:36,370
Chat.

3985
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:37,450
Oh, wait.

3986
02:21:37,570 --> 02:21:38,550
Wait, is it 6-0?

3987
02:21:38,710 --> 02:21:39,730
Nope, that's last game.

3988
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:42,050
Alright.

3989
02:21:42,250 --> 02:21:43,070
Two more games.

3990
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:48,730
It's okay, guys.

3991
02:21:48,990 --> 02:21:50,490
Are we all having a good time together?

3992
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:51,830
I'm having a great time.

3993
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:54,570
It's all about creating the memories, guys.

3994
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:56,490
Right.

3995
02:21:56,670 --> 02:21:58,830
Mac, are you happy I dragged you into this?

3996
02:21:58,830 --> 02:22:01,050
And ruin your reputation even more?

3997
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:03,250
What do you mean?

3998
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:06,450
I heard the last game you guys played together was bad, alright?

3999
02:22:08,190 --> 02:22:12,190
Reddit's gonna be like, Wow, ClassicAlb switched to M&K and now he's doing worse again.

4000
02:22:14,470 --> 02:22:17,790
And then they're gonna see Doki and then they're gonna be like, Oh, wait, never mind.

4001
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:20,670
He's just gonna retire after this rivals.

4002
02:22:21,090 --> 02:22:21,590
No, he's gonna see Doki and Tempo.

4003
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:23,330
What do you mean, and Tempo?

4004
02:22:23,430 --> 02:22:24,350
What do you mean?

4005
02:22:24,670 --> 02:22:26,650
I died because of you!

4006
02:22:26,650 --> 02:22:28,370
What do you mean by that?

4007
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:29,790
I should have had some map awareness.

4008
02:22:36,290 --> 02:22:36,690
Damn.

4009
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:40,210
My third doesn't listen to the IGL.

4010
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:42,230
So I get punished.

4011
02:22:42,730 --> 02:22:45,070
Then I go, Yo, Tempo, kill that guy over there.

4012
02:22:45,350 --> 02:22:47,030
Tempo, just fucking in La La Land.

4013
02:22:47,030 --> 02:22:48,710
I remembered why I ran away.

4014
02:22:48,830 --> 02:22:50,070
Because I was being shot in the side.

4015
02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:53,690
Then I said, Tempo, you're gonna get shot in the side up there.

4016
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:56,530
So I ran towards you to get away from the side.

4017
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:58,570
No, you said to slide down to Doki.

4018
02:22:58,830 --> 02:22:59,850
You could have ran to me.

4019
02:22:59,870 --> 02:23:00,810
We could have killed Rev.

4020
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:04,810
My brain is now remembering what happened.

4021
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:05,790
Okay, guys.

4022
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:09,590
The last Twitch Rivals we got with Wig was 13 points.

4023
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:18,150
So in two games, if we get more than 13 points, then at least we improved.

4024
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:19,530
So in two games, we need what?

4025
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:21,710
Then we improved, guys.

4026
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,370
Five more points?

4027
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:26,030
Bro, there's a team 5 that got 11.

4028
02:23:26,210 --> 02:23:28,230
Team 13 got 11 points.

4029
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:29,190
Jesus Christ.

4030
02:23:29,390 --> 02:23:30,290
How do we see where it is?

4031
02:23:31,210 --> 02:23:31,850
Oh, right.

4032
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:34,350
Game 5.

4033
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:40,850
Alright.

4034
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:41,690
Guys.

4035
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,830
I still have hope.

4036
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,030
Me too.

4037
02:23:46,810 --> 02:23:51,950
Despite everything we've been through, I still have hope in us.

4038
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:52,430
I still have hope in us.

4039
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:55,890
It's not over yet.

4040
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:56,290
It's not over yet.

4041
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:04,260
Okay.

4042
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:04,620
Yeah.

4043
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:08,620
We can get anywhere from 9 to 12th place.

4044
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:08,960
Alright.

4045
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:09,480
We're still good.

4046
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:12,600
Wait.

4047
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:14,600
Oh, wait.

4048
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:14,960
Here we go.

4049
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,700
I need you to swap some...

4050
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:17,040
Bang fuse.

4051
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:24,800
I need you to swap some of that data on keeping track of score into listening to IGL.

4052
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:26,400
I listen all the time.

4053
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:27,960
I need you to swap some of those...

4054
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:29,840
Alright.

4055
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:37,940
Can people in Temple's chat clip that moment when Mac was like, Temple, can you go help Doki on...

4056
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:38,820
Just what?

4057
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:39,620
Joke's on you.

4058
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,600
No one's in my stream.

4059
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:41,420
Suck it.

4060
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:46,100
Can someone go to Temple's stream right now and clip that exact moment?

4061
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:48,580
I'm pretty sure I also don't have VODs on.

4062
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,320
You don't have VODs on, did you?

4063
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:54,000
Last time I turned...

4064
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:02,140
Last time I had auto VODs on, someone I was watch-parting had music and then I got like a copy strike thingy.

4065
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:03,680
That's pretty funny.

4066
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:08,260
So then I just made it where I have to publish it after the stream ends.

4067
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:11,060
Oh, you're one of those people.

4068
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:13,120
I don't want to get banned.

4069
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:22,780
Alright guys, we got BangFuse, Octane Wraith, Conduit, Mirage, and Loba.

4070
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:29,060
So we use Fuse for the map, for the beacon.

4071
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:36,700
Longbow L-Star are the guns that give you stuff.

4072
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:38,240
Okay, we play Bang.

4073
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:40,560
We'll play Bang.

4074
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:42,280
I'm already on Fuse.

4075
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:43,000
Okay.

4076
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:45,860
For the beacon scan, right?

4077
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:47,420
So we know where the zone is.

4078
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:49,040
Yeah.

4079
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:51,820
We'll play Fuse, Bang, and we'll Fuse attack people.

4080
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:54,900
And then we'll play...

4081
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:56,500
Alright, B.

4082
02:25:57,740 --> 02:25:58,260
Uhh...

4083
02:26:02,060 --> 02:26:04,900
So, we're doing Bang, Fuse, and what?

4084
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:07,800
Umm, figuring that out.

4085
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:12,940
I'm trying to cook something, but the colors in my brain are not turning.

4086
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:13,920
So we put...

4087
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:14,600
That is not good.

4088
02:26:17,060 --> 02:26:18,840
That is not what I wanted.

4089
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:21,120
Loba, probably.

4090
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:28,440
Okay, so I can do... I guess you're on Bang, and Tempo's on Fuse, and then I'm on Loba.

4091
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:29,860
Yeah.

4092
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:32,160
Alright, that seems hopeful.

4093
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:36,680
I don't know what else to say!

4094
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:41,120
I'm just...

4095
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:42,760
That's...

4096
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:46,180
It's...

4097
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:47,420
It's somewhere.

4098
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:48,580
We're...

4099
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:51,660
We're getting somewhere here.

4100
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:53,560
Alright, and... It'll be fine.

4101
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:57,700
Cuz Tempo can grab two grenades at once out of the Loba.

4102
02:26:57,700 --> 02:26:57,940
Yeah.

4103
02:26:58,270 --> 02:27:00,680
Okay, do we just need to find a house and live there?

4104
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,920
That's all we need to do.

4105
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:02,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4106
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:04,180
Yeah, we'll find a cozy house.

4107
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:05,560
We'll Loba ult in it.

4108
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,020
Tempo will get a million grenades.

4109
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:08,740
I'll grab the evacs.

4110
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:13,000
We'll have nine evac towers, and anyone that comes near us, we're just fucking Fuse ulting our evac.

4111
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:16,020
How do we have nine evac towers?

4112
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:17,720
Cuz we play Loba.

4113
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:19,740
Yeah, I'm gonna be Loba.

4114
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:21,840
Isn't that only three evac towers?

4115
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:22,240
What?

4116
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:23,460
What?

4117
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:25,920
Tempo, you're missing the plot.

4118
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:26,680
What?

4119
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:28,360
I'm confused.

4120
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:36,980
So we're gonna sit in a building, and then we're gonna put a Loba ult down, and we're all gonna grab an evac tower, then we'll drop them, and we'll pick up more evac towers.

4121
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,140
So we have nine evacs in our house, yeah.

4122
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:39,880
Got it.

4123
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:41,800
And then someone pulls up, we evac.

4124
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:44,260
Wait, do you know how to do it?

4125
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:44,840
Right, Tempo?

4126
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:46,280
Yeah, just shoot the bang.

4127
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:47,340
What?

4128
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:50,040
Yeah, you shoot the bang smoke with the Fuse ult.

4129
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:50,860
Okay, yeah.

4130
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:55,560
Hey, didn't we have land heights?

4131
02:27:57,660 --> 02:27:58,540
No, Tempo.

4132
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:00,160
We landed boardwalk.

4133
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:01,660
Oh, right.

4134
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:06,260
Oh, we need a longbow.

4135
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:08,240
Wait, what are the guns?

4136
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:09,140
It's just...

4137
02:28:09,140 --> 02:28:09,860
Elstar longbow.

4138
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:11,460
Okay, it's actually a good...

4139
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:12,160
This isn't bad.

4140
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:12,820
This is doable.

4141
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:13,200
That's a good combo.

4142
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:17,320
Okay.

4143
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:19,280
Yeah, that's really the only guns that matter.

4144
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:22,200
Because, you know, a lot of the other kills don't count.

4145
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:23,300
Apparently.

4146
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:25,660
Oh, wait.

4147
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:27,020
So... Oh, no, wait.

4148
02:28:27,220 --> 02:28:29,460
Wait, I'm gonna go pick Loba right now.

4149
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:30,200
Okay.

4150
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:31,020
It's okay.

4151
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:32,440
They won't start the game without me.

4152
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,340
I'm important.

4153
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:33,900
Yeah, yeah.

4154
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:36,140
Right?

4155
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:37,240
I also backed out.

4156
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:37,580
Okay.

4157
02:28:37,980 --> 02:28:38,820
Yeah, they...

4158
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:41,420
Well, we don't know about that, but like...

4159
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:41,840
Oh, okay.

4160
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:50,660
It's 50-50.

4161
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:55,900
All right.

4162
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:57,180
I believe it.

4163
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:58,320
I believe in us.

4164
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:00,500
I believe.

4165
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:01,960
I believe in us.

4166
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:06,000
There's no way.

4167
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:07,180
There's no way.

4168
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:14,720
As long as we beat 13 points, we've like... Tempo and I have technically improved, and we can say that Wig was the problem.

4169
02:29:18,460 --> 02:29:20,220
If you think about it.

4170
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:21,640
If you think about it.

4171
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,400
It's like how...

4172
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:25,600
It's like how, like, you and I...

4173
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,440
We won... Wait, no, not...

4174
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:28,020
Not you.

4175
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:28,580
You weren't there.

4176
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:31,240
I won first place in, like, one of your tournaments.

4177
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:34,840
We got first place in one of the...

4178
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:35,800
JP tournaments.

4179
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,460
Oh, yeah, we did, too!

4180
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:38,360
Yeah.

4181
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:39,380
Awesome!

4182
02:29:39,540 --> 02:29:40,520
And that was without Wig, too.

4183
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:41,220
That was with Link.

4184
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:42,460
Wig, we're not the problem!

4185
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,800
Yeah, that was with Link, too.

4186
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:45,420
Yeah!

4187
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:47,880
And he had, like, 300 ping.

4188
02:29:49,060 --> 02:29:49,460
Exactly.

4189
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:52,800
We're not the problem, Tempo!

4190
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:56,280
Yeah, it's because Wig keeps taking vacations like this.

4191
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:56,760
That's why.

4192
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:03,700
Guys, it's not toxic, because Wig did this to me in front of 80,000 people.

4193
02:30:04,180 --> 02:30:04,660
So...

4194
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:08,000
It is not toxic.

4195
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:15,060
He did the same thing in front of 80,000 people on an official ALGS stream.

4196
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:20,180
So I get to have this.

4197
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:20,920
I...

4198
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:27,070
Alright.

4199
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:30,730
Just ping?

4200
02:30:31,210 --> 02:30:31,730
Oh.

4201
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:38,400
Alright.

4202
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:40,380
Tempo, do you have the right character selected?

4203
02:30:41,460 --> 02:30:41,980
Yup.

4204
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:42,840
Which is?

4205
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,480
I got me Fusey.

4206
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:46,060
Alright.

4207
02:30:46,220 --> 02:30:48,000
Just wanna make sure you know who it was.

4208
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:48,300
I'm ready.

4209
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:50,640
I know Matt's paying attention.

4210
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:53,120
Because his, like, reputation's online.

4211
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:55,100
Is it?

4212
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:59,580
We'll see you in competitive Apex Reddit later.

4213
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:13,030
Hey, at least in the end, we all have free money.

4214
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:14,310
True.

4215
02:31:14,490 --> 02:31:14,850
True.

4216
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:15,210
Yeah!

4217
02:31:15,430 --> 02:31:16,830
That's why I love Twitch Rivals.

4218
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:18,610
Free money!

4219
02:31:18,910 --> 02:31:19,570
Free money!

4220
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:20,710
Yippee!

4221
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:25,770
I love free money.

4222
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:38,400
This is it.

4223
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:39,860
What were you waiting for?

4224
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,620
Oh, Google Go.

4225
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:43,960
Ready, ready, ready.

4226
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:46,240
My fucking energy.

4227
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:48,160
Everyone, everyone spam click the ready button.

4228
02:31:49,140 --> 02:31:51,040
My energy is dying.

4229
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:51,880
Please.

4230
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:53,220
Here, have a Red Bull.

4231
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:54,100
No.

4232
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:57,020
I haven't drank energy drinks in, like, years.

4233
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:59,360
Wait, does GamerSup count?

4234
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,560
GamerSup is an energy drink, man.

4235
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:04,100
But it's powdered.

4236
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,100
That's the same.

4237
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:07,300
Yeah.

4238
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:11,360
That's different.

4239
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:12,600
It's powdered.

4240
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,340
Oh, no, no.

4241
02:32:16,460 --> 02:32:18,760
How can it be energy if it's...

4242
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:21,500
How can it be an energy drink if it's made of powder?

4243
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:24,960
Guys, by the way...

4244
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,560
Energy drinks and a powder, too.

4245
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:29,400
By the way, did you guys know I have a GamerSup code?

4246
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:34,420
Did you guys know that?

4247
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:37,280
Where's the Discord cricket sound?

4248
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,340
Where's the Discord cricket sound?

4249
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:44,700
Anyway, guys, if you guys want to try out GamerSup, I have a code, and it's...

4250
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:47,720
If you use DokiBird, you get, like, 15%...

4251
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:50,880
You get 10% off of your GamerSup order.

4252
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:55,080
I'll definitely use that.

4253
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:55,700
Yeah.

4254
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:00,800
Actually, I'm pretty sure I have a cupboard full of that.

4255
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:03,560
A cupboard full of what?

4256
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:04,340
A pantry.

4257
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:06,400
A pantry full of GamerSup.

4258
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:07,080
Wait, really?

4259
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:07,380
Why?

4260
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:09,280
I don't know.

4261
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:16,320
I just got a pantry full of a bunch of protein powder, a bunch of energy drinks, and a bunch of...

4262
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:22,280
You ever just, like, go through one day and take, like, a fraction of a scoop of all of them and put them in one cup?

4263
02:33:22,460 --> 02:33:24,420
Oh, just mix all the different brands?

4264
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:28,340
Yeah, the protein powder, the pre-workout, all the... Jesus!

4265
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:32,160
Don't mix it with water, mix it with an energy drink.

4266
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:33,740
Yeah, yeah, mix it with, like, a monster.

4267
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,720
No, mix it with alcohol.

4268
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:36,600
What are you talking about?

4269
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:37,560
Oh, no, you got it.

4270
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,200
Don't do that!

4271
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:42,560
Guys, don't do that!

4272
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,220
That's a joke!

4273
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:45,300
Actually, don't do that!

4274
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:46,620
That's actually a joke!

4275
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,280
No, it's actually not that bad.

4276
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:53,040
Do not do what I just said.

4277
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:57,780
Before COVID was a thing, I would mix...

4278
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:01,300
Before COVID was a thing, you take a blue Gatorade...

4279
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:02,360
Yeah?

4280
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:08,060
You get rid of two-thirds of it, then you fill...

4281
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:10,640
then you fill, um...

4282
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:14,640
like, almost two-thirds of it with an energy drink.

4283
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:16,700
Usually it was just Red Bull.

4284
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:18,160
Yeah, oh, Jesus, what the fuck?

4285
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,240
Or Monster, doesn't really matter.

4286
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:27,340
You have to fill it with the regular one, because then it'll change that blue into, like, a Hulk green, and then you put two shots of vodka in it.

4287
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:29,040
Jesus, what the fuck, Tempo?

4288
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:32,600
And then that was my super drink called Hulk piss.

4289
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:34,340
Is this what you would drink at school?

4290
02:34:35,460 --> 02:34:36,460
No, this was...

4291
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:38,500
this was for volleyball.

4292
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:39,860
Before volleyball matches.

4293
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,220
What the fuck?

4294
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:45,540
Tempo's pulling up to play volleyball off the Hulk piss, just like, fucking...

4295
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:48,180
Bro, volleyball goes fucking hard, man.

4296
02:34:48,180 --> 02:34:49,740
And then I'd be like, oh yeah, I'm gonna smash this ball right into your head.

4297
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:50,860
What the fuck?

4298
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:51,840
It was so much fun.

4299
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:54,500
You do that for volleyball?

4300
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:57,080
Yeah, that's the super energy drink.

4301
02:34:57,780 --> 02:34:58,780
Yeah, the vodka.

4302
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:03,900
Get that vodka in for fucking volleyball, Jesus Christ.

4303
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:07,600
And then, yeah, the mocktail version of that would be with no vodka, but you know.

4304
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:11,800
Dude's going to spike the ball just completely fucking missing.

4305
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:12,740
What do you mean?

4306
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:16,340
I was not a spiker.

4307
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,180
I was... my main...

4308
02:35:18,180 --> 02:35:21,000
was setting and blocking.

4309
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:22,320
Oh, shit.

4310
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,180
You gotta be numb for that.

4311
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:25,900
That's why you put the vodka in.

4312
02:35:26,200 --> 02:35:26,640
Exactly.

4313
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:29,820
Sometimes I jump so high, I block with my face.

4314
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:33,100
So you can't feel your face.

4315
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:35,620
So I don't feel it.

4316
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:36,320
Yeah.

4317
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:39,320
Oh, shit.

4318
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:41,280
By the way, Booster Weapons, L-Star, and Longbow.

4319
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:42,480
Yeah.

4320
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:43,640
Wait, who am I playing?

4321
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:44,900
What do you mean?

4322
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:45,320
Bangalore.

4323
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:45,920
I forgot.

4324
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:46,660
I forgot.

4325
02:35:48,300 --> 02:35:50,400
The Hulk piss unlocked me, man.

4326
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:52,300
The Hawk piss?

4327
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:55,180
It was great.

4328
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:56,420
Noba.

4329
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:59,960
I assume so.

4330
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:01,600
That's why it only works with blue.

4331
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,020
That's why it only works with blue.

4332
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:07,580
It says that one point per member that lands in the designated...

4333
02:36:07,580 --> 02:36:08,960
Does that mean each member gets a point?

4334
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,380
If they land in a designated location?

4335
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:15,960
Wait, then shouldn't we get three for that dome one?

4336
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:17,920
I guess so.

4337
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:20,220
Yeah, we should have.

4338
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:23,960
Is that how we got three points last time?

4339
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:24,840
No.

4340
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:26,860
Wait, did you not add that?

4341
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,080
Yeah, I guess not.

4342
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,320
Wait, then we should yell at them to add it.

4343
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:33,400
Oh, okay, somebody...

4344
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:34,540
Oh, minus five!

4345
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:35,800
Who fucked up?

4346
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:36,420
Is it us?

4347
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:36,820
That's another minus five.

4348
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:38,660
I feel like I'm so excited for every minus five.

4349
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:40,360
Minus five.

4350
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:41,620
He's like, oh, minus five!

4351
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:42,200
Who did it?

4352
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:42,360
Minus five.

4353
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:46,680
Team mate?

4354
02:36:46,760 --> 02:36:47,740
Oh, Jordan's team.

4355
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:49,520
Jordan, minus five.

4356
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:50,420
Wait, really?

4357
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:52,660
Jordan, minus five.

4358
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:54,660
Distraction.

4359
02:36:56,360 --> 02:36:58,280
Yo, Jordan said he has ten points.

4360
02:36:58,280 --> 02:37:00,220
Minus five puts him at five, which is below us now.

4361
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:00,800
Sucker!

4362
02:37:04,260 --> 02:37:05,260
Chill, guys.

4363
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:06,740
We have ten points.

4364
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:07,780
No!

4365
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:10,180
We need him to be minus five!

4366
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:10,720
No!

4367
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:13,920
We moved up a placement and we didn't even have to do anything.

4368
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:22,160
If we minus his points, my team can be above his.

4369
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:22,440
It is.

4370
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:33,360
Let me have this.

4371
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:41,760
And then we can say a VTuber is higher.

4372
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:45,520
No, I shouldn't say that.

4373
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:46,460
My viewership is higher?

4374
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:49,660
No, I can say the VTuber is higher placed.

4375
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:50,420
Oh, the VTuber.

4376
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,480
The VTuber community says minus it.

4377
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:55,960
Minus the points.

4378
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:57,780
Minus five.

4379
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:03,780
Alright.

4380
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:07,300
Wait, so like, we should complain about the drops from that dome?

4381
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:08,660
We need those three points.

4382
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:10,320
I don't think they added it.

4383
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:13,680
I think they said they add like the bonus point stuff.

4384
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,240
Okay, you gotta be sure about that.

4385
02:38:17,420 --> 02:38:19,860
Only the gun bonus points were added.

4386
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:23,260
Okay, should we land on the bonus area?

4387
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:24,400
Like, two of us?

4388
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:27,060
And then...

4389
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:29,360
Oh, is that how people keep getting points?

4390
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,160
And then Tempo, you can be our safe line and then...

4391
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:36,080
Is that what we do?

4392
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:38,380
Does it actually say per person?

4393
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:39,820
Yeah, isn't it?

4394
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:44,100
One extra point per member that does their first landing in designated location.

4395
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:44,500
Yeah.

4396
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:45,780
Yeah, so...

4397
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:49,920
So you guys just land there, kill as many people as you can, I'll just be in La La Land.

4398
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:50,780
We don't need to kill anything!

4399
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:54,200
We literally just need to go there and die and then land and then drop on you.

4400
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:56,440
We don't even...

4401
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:57,820
Kills don't matter.

4402
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:00,500
Oh no, find a longbow and then kill someone.

4403
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4404
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:04,060
Mac, take me to Hydra Stadium.

4405
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:07,320
I'm thinking about Boardwalk.

4406
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:09,740
No, we need to land there for the bonus points.

4407
02:39:10,060 --> 02:39:12,000
Yeah, we get three bonus points if we land there.

4408
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:14,640
No, we get two because Tempo, you're our safe line.

4409
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:15,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4410
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,880
Wait, Doki should go alone because I have an ability that can shoot people.

4411
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:26,560
No, please don't put too much pressure on me, I don't do so well.

4412
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:29,740
Doki's gonna crack.

4413
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:31,680
I don't do so well.

4414
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:32,240
I believe in you.

4415
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:35,920
She's gonna be like, wait, someone's landing on me, I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm dead.

4416
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:41,540
Alright, where is Heights and Stadium?

4417
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:43,420
This is how people keep getting two free points!

4418
02:39:44,220 --> 02:39:44,580
Heights.

4419
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:47,060
Wait, where is our land?

4420
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:48,240
Stadium is over there.

4421
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:51,660
So, is it me or Tempo that's gonna be the safe line?

4422
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,400
Uh, both of you can go.

4423
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:55,720
I'll be a safe line.

4424
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:57,280
Wait, you're gonna be a safe line?

4425
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:58,620
Oh, I've been kidnapped.

4426
02:39:58,860 --> 02:40:00,000
Okay, you got that.

4427
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:01,200
Wait, what?

4428
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:02,160
Go ahead.

4429
02:40:02,300 --> 02:40:03,100
Go over there.

4430
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:06,100
Who's ready to f***?

4431
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:07,180
Okay.

4432
02:40:07,980 --> 02:40:11,920
Don't shoot anyone unless you have an L-star or a longbow.

4433
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:15,720
I have so much confidence right now.

4434
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:20,240
Yo, some people are not even gonna be able to fly to here because they're stupid.

4435
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:22,860
I landed on a longbow.

4436
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:24,720
Okay, you gotta live!

4437
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:28,660
I'm gonna go there and just die and then spawn next to you.

4438
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:29,480
Yo, I'm gonna kill someone.

4439
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,060
What do you mean?

4440
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:30,980
Okay.

4441
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:32,840
Why do we need kills?

4442
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,380
Kills don't f***ing matter!

4443
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:36,520
Kill him with a longbow or an L-star?

4444
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:37,100
Kill him with a longbow.

4445
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:38,100
I'm looking for a longbow.

4446
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:39,440
Yo, suck my...

4447
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:43,520
I don't think Tempo's gonna kill on a longbow.

4448
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:46,240
What the f***?

4449
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:47,640
Yeah, that's right, Q-Bitch!

4450
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:50,200
That's not a longbow, you shit-stain!

4451
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:53,520
I couldn't find a longbow.

4452
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:58,140
Wait, we're... oh, I'm landing on Mac now.

4453
02:40:58,340 --> 02:40:58,660
Nice.

4454
02:40:58,660 --> 02:40:59,420
Yeah, I'm over here.

4455
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:00,220
You better land on him.

4456
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:01,200
Alright, free point!

4457
02:41:01,900 --> 02:41:03,600
Well, why did it not land me on you?

4458
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:06,320
You do not want to land on me.

4459
02:41:06,620 --> 02:41:09,580
I know, but why did my plane... well, who does the plane choose?

4460
02:41:09,820 --> 02:41:09,840
Because I don't f***ing know.

4461
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:10,900
Is it new or planned?

4462
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:12,180
Nice.

4463
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,520
I can't die because there's nobody next to me!

4464
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:15,160
Oh, there he is.

4465
02:41:15,160 --> 02:41:16,460
Just find a longbow and shoot someone.

4466
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:17,220
I can't!

4467
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:18,060
There's no longbow!

4468
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:20,820
Oh, I fell.

4469
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:22,080
Oh, I almost fell.

4470
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:25,580
Longbow, longbow, longbow.

4471
02:41:27,180 --> 02:41:27,880
Oh, he...

4472
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:29,220
Oh, no!

4473
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:30,020
Okay, good.

4474
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:30,640
That's good.

4475
02:41:30,700 --> 02:41:31,040
I'm out.

4476
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:32,740
I'm finally free from this hell.

4477
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:37,100
Thank God.

4478
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:38,240
Hello, I'm back.

4479
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:40,160
Wait, what was... oh, longbow L-star.

4480
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:40,720
Right, right, right.

4481
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:41,380
Wait.

4482
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:43,580
I'm back.

4483
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:47,960
I get to actually be free, but we got two points.

4484
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:49,300
I did it, guys.

4485
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:52,080
Deuce points!

4486
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:54,000
Alright.

4487
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:58,080
Oh, we definitely should have figured that out a lot earlier.

4488
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:02,860
Wait, so, like, you don't get points at all with any other gun but the boosted loader?

4489
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:03,080
Yeah.

4490
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:04,280
That's so dumb.

4491
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:05,020
What?

4492
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:06,780
No, but the longbow and the L-star.

4493
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:07,840
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4494
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:08,740
Like, sorry, not boosted loader.

4495
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:09,640
Boosted gun.

4496
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:11,240
She's calling that the boosted loader.

4497
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:14,660
Okay, it's like boosted gun, so I think boosted loader.

4498
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:18,060
We want the ultimate range, right?

4499
02:42:18,460 --> 02:42:19,040
Oh, wait.

4500
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:20,540
You're Loba.

4501
02:42:20,780 --> 02:42:21,500
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

4502
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:22,140
You want your throw distance.

4503
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:23,220
Throw distance?

4504
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:24,480
You don't want more loot?

4505
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:25,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4506
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:25,960
Okay.

4507
02:42:26,580 --> 02:42:29,420
You wanna throw your thingamajig down so we can...

4508
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:30,260
I don't have it.

4509
02:42:30,260 --> 02:42:31,400
I literally just died.

4510
02:42:32,140 --> 02:42:33,280
Why didn't you die earlier?

4511
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:34,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

4512
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:36,080
Nobody wanted to kill me.

4513
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:40,080
Here's the 6x.

4514
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:42,700
Actually, I'm taking that if we're fucking running longbow.

4515
02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:47,330
Oh, can't climb that.

4516
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:49,010
Oh, no, definitely can't climb that.

4517
02:42:50,670 --> 02:42:51,650
Wait, I hear people.

4518
02:42:51,910 --> 02:42:52,310
No.

4519
02:42:52,430 --> 02:42:53,050
No, you don't.

4520
02:42:53,070 --> 02:42:54,150
I think I also hear people.

4521
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:55,330
Oh, no, you don't.

4522
02:42:57,330 --> 02:42:58,450
Yo, you know what you do?

4523
02:42:58,550 --> 02:43:00,790
Throw a longbow on the ground and bait someone with it.

4524
02:43:02,650 --> 02:43:04,290
I mean, you could do that.

4525
02:43:06,270 --> 02:43:07,390
Well, actually, I'm...

4526
02:43:07,390 --> 02:43:10,630
Since we're running L-star, I'm gonna... Oh, wait.

4527
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:11,730
Did you actually find people?

4528
02:43:14,390 --> 02:43:15,090
Yeah, they're here.

4529
02:43:16,450 --> 02:43:17,930
I'm not close to you guys.

4530
02:43:19,370 --> 02:43:19,850
I'm just sitting on height.

4531
02:43:19,850 --> 02:43:20,310
We're fairly close.

4532
02:43:20,690 --> 02:43:21,810
One's crossing over here.

4533
02:43:22,170 --> 02:43:22,890
I'm fine.

4534
02:43:23,090 --> 02:43:23,350
I'm just...

4535
02:43:23,350 --> 02:43:24,150
You guys will be fine, right?

4536
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:24,790
Because I'm looting.

4537
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:28,570
I'm looting right now.

4538
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:29,390
They're looking for Tempo.

4539
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:31,450
Why are they looking for him?

4540
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:35,230
Well, they're on you, Tempo.

4541
02:43:35,810 --> 02:43:36,650
Throwing a nade at that guy.

4542
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:38,130
Bleed out.

4543
02:43:38,170 --> 02:43:38,630
Bleed out.

4544
02:43:38,630 --> 02:43:38,990
Bleed out.

4545
02:43:38,990 --> 02:43:39,570
That's not a longbow.

4546
02:43:39,610 --> 02:43:40,070
You're a shit stain.

4547
02:43:41,730 --> 02:43:42,110
Alright, no kills.

4548
02:43:42,210 --> 02:43:42,530
We're good.

4549
02:43:43,870 --> 02:43:46,290
Yo, let me find my gun, you cock.

4550
02:43:46,590 --> 02:43:48,030
I can't find anything.

4551
02:43:50,610 --> 02:43:52,010
I hate looting this.

4552
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:53,510
I'm so confused sometimes.

4553
02:43:56,030 --> 02:43:57,010
Not sometimes.

4554
02:43:57,150 --> 02:43:57,970
I'm always confused.

4555
02:43:58,570 --> 02:44:01,950
Alright, I'm gonna go land, like, far away so I can go find your longbow.

4556
02:44:02,190 --> 02:44:04,210
I'm kinda just chilling up here and being annoying.

4557
02:44:04,610 --> 02:44:07,890
I don't play this map enough to realize how to loot this.

4558
02:44:10,390 --> 02:44:11,230
I knocked one.

4559
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:12,530
Good job.

4560
02:44:12,710 --> 02:44:13,990
Oh, with the longbow!

4561
02:44:14,890 --> 02:44:15,510
Thresh him!

4562
02:44:15,630 --> 02:44:15,870
Thresh him!

4563
02:44:15,930 --> 02:44:16,130
Thresh him!

4564
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:20,890
Oh, I have my ult.

4565
02:44:21,330 --> 02:44:22,450
I'm gonna ult here.

4566
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:24,190
Oh, they just got shot in the back.

4567
02:44:24,430 --> 02:44:25,350
I got my kill.

4568
02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:25,990
Nice!

4569
02:44:26,010 --> 02:44:26,870
That's plus one!

4570
02:44:27,450 --> 02:44:28,190
Plus one!

4571
02:44:28,690 --> 02:44:29,590
And plus two!

4572
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:30,390
There's three kills here.

4573
02:44:30,630 --> 02:44:31,770
We're fucking plus three.

4574
02:44:33,790 --> 02:44:34,950
There's no L-star.

4575
02:44:35,510 --> 02:44:36,730
Oh, there's a longbow!

4576
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:42,070
It's actually the one that he just died with.

4577
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:44,150
Oh my god, I got it.

4578
02:44:45,470 --> 02:44:46,350
Let's see...

4579
02:44:46,350 --> 02:44:48,150
I'm gonna grab the 4x8.

4580
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:49,610
Oh, I found a longbow!

4581
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:50,410
Me too!

4582
02:44:51,310 --> 02:44:52,810
I'm heading over to you!

4583
02:44:53,830 --> 02:44:54,410
I got my knock.

4584
02:44:55,450 --> 02:44:56,590
I forgot to grab ammo!

4585
02:44:57,430 --> 02:44:58,310
Oh, bleed out!

4586
02:44:58,330 --> 02:44:59,010
I'm safe!

4587
02:44:59,070 --> 02:44:59,390
I'm safe!

4588
02:44:59,450 --> 02:44:59,770
Bleed out!

4589
02:44:59,970 --> 02:45:01,830
I got the points!

4590
02:45:04,250 --> 02:45:06,310
Just keep in mind you're on scan when I die.

4591
02:45:06,450 --> 02:45:06,870
I know.

4592
02:45:06,910 --> 02:45:07,390
That's why I'm leaving.

4593
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:09,570
Yeah, time to just scatter.

4594
02:45:09,770 --> 02:45:11,950
We just have to be bastards and take our licks.

4595
02:45:12,050 --> 02:45:14,690
Like we just kill someone and just take the lick and reset.

4596
02:45:14,910 --> 02:45:16,070
Look what tempo is!

4597
02:45:16,290 --> 02:45:17,490
We're so okay.

4598
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:20,570
He's literally not even with us anymore.

4599
02:45:21,090 --> 02:45:21,910
He's just gone.

4600
02:45:21,950 --> 02:45:22,670
He's just running around.

4601
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:24,750
I'm still looking for a L-star.

4602
02:45:25,610 --> 02:45:26,170
Yeah, same.

4603
02:45:26,270 --> 02:45:28,270
I'm longbow fucking nemesis.

4604
02:45:28,690 --> 02:45:29,670
Wait, me too!

4605
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:29,730
Me too!

4606
02:45:33,790 --> 02:45:35,650
Imagine you get a golden longbow.

4607
02:45:36,270 --> 02:45:37,070
God, no.

4608
02:45:37,090 --> 02:45:38,670
Why does it just force you straight down?

4609
02:45:38,730 --> 02:45:39,830
You can't like fly at all.

4610
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:41,070
Where even is the zone?

4611
02:45:41,190 --> 02:45:41,630
Yeah, I know.

4612
02:45:41,810 --> 02:45:42,690
It's so dumb.

4613
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:44,250
I'mma head to you guys.

4614
02:45:46,210 --> 02:45:47,670
We need to find a house.

4615
02:45:47,970 --> 02:45:48,190
Shit!

4616
02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:48,830
Someone's here.

4617
02:45:49,210 --> 02:45:51,050
We gotta figure out where to live.

4618
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:52,810
Found an event.

4619
02:45:53,290 --> 02:45:54,090
Tempo found people.

4620
02:45:54,590 --> 02:45:55,030
Alright.

4621
02:45:57,190 --> 02:45:58,550
I'mma jump in this fire.

4622
02:45:59,790 --> 02:46:00,590
Control left!

4623
02:46:00,710 --> 02:46:01,310
Left control!

4624
02:46:01,630 --> 02:46:01,950
Yeah, that's right.

4625
02:46:02,290 --> 02:46:03,770
I got 15, 20 seconds.

4626
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:09,900
I didn't even see that guy.

4627
02:46:10,360 --> 02:46:12,280
Well, I'm hiding here until Tempo's back.

4628
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:13,840
Wait, where's my mouse?

4629
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:16,500
Bangalore 2481.

4630
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:18,520
Mac, where's the end zone so we can head there?

4631
02:46:19,260 --> 02:46:19,920
I don't know.

4632
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:20,880
Tempo never hit the ring.

4633
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:21,900
Oh.

4634
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:24,160
You're landing on me, Tempo.

4635
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:25,860
No, I'm not.

4636
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:26,720
Yes, you are.

4637
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:27,940
I literally see your thing.

4638
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:29,240
I'm like on the other side of the wall.

4639
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:30,280
That's me.

4640
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:31,800
That's me.

4641
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:34,200
The green was on me.

4642
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:36,580
Alright, I am going.

4643
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:38,440
No, the green is on you.

4644
02:46:38,460 --> 02:46:39,280
He's spawning on you.

4645
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:39,720
He's confused.

4646
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:41,520
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4647
02:46:42,280 --> 02:46:43,780
He's just going where he wants to go.

4648
02:46:44,520 --> 02:46:47,300
It's like I'm pretty sure I saw the green literally on you.

4649
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:48,200
Oh, that's another team.

4650
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:48,720
Never mind.

4651
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:51,100
Okay, I'm heading to you.

4652
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:53,120
What do you mean?

4653
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:54,920
Wait, how did he get there?

4654
02:46:55,060 --> 02:46:56,820
How did he get there?

4655
02:46:57,980 --> 02:46:58,900
He just flew over the wall.

4656
02:46:58,900 --> 02:47:00,360
How did he get there?

4657
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:01,360
I'm moving.

4658
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:02,680
I got movement.

4659
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:03,500
M and K movement.

4660
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:06,280
Oh my god, Monarch, thank you for the raid.

4661
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:08,000
Hey guys.

4662
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:10,000
Amali raided me.

4663
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:11,180
I'm about to headshot someone.

4664
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:15,240
Ooh, I don't need that, but like...

4665
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:16,020
I need that shield.

4666
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:17,060
Here.

4667
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:18,900
I got it.

4668
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:20,300
Alright, where are we going?

4669
02:47:21,400 --> 02:47:23,260
We're gonna try to walk into zone.

4670
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:24,680
Tempo, how's it looking over there?

4671
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:26,020
Can we walk in over there?

4672
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:27,080
There's people all over me.

4673
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,100
Oh, okay.

4674
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:28,660
I'm gonna evac.

4675
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:29,980
Wait, I'm gonna do this.

4676
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,260
Wait, actually there's no loot.

4677
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:34,440
I don't think there's loot there.

4678
02:47:35,460 --> 02:47:35,900
Ow.

4679
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:38,980
Bad news, you might die.

4680
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:39,800
I might die.

4681
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:41,900
I might not.

4682
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:50,880
Tempo, we need you to be alive because there's a possibility that Mac and I are gonna be fucking dead.

4683
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:55,760
I'm gonna throw a bat on.

4684
02:47:55,860 --> 02:47:56,000
I'm gonna throw a bat on.

4685
02:47:56,020 --> 02:47:56,840
They might run at us.

4686
02:47:57,860 --> 02:47:58,540
No, 100%.

4687
02:47:58,540 --> 02:47:59,060
No, I agree.

4688
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:01,780
Oh, I threw a med kit on because there's a thing being in the wrong spot.

4689
02:48:01,900 --> 02:48:02,700
Alright, I'm a piece of shit.

4690
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:05,360
There's definitely no word here because I threw this too.

4691
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:07,480
Yeah, I'm gonna go grab this EVA.

4692
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:09,140
There's no L-Star anywhere.

4693
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:09,860
That's crazy.

4694
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:12,800
There's some bodies over here.

4695
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:14,100
Oh.

4696
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:15,920
TSM banner.

4697
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:16,920
Wait, is this Jordan's body?

4698
02:48:17,140 --> 02:48:17,660
Oh, shit.

4699
02:48:18,020 --> 02:48:18,760
Do you back him?

4700
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:19,660
Uh-oh.

4701
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:21,800
I'm running.

4702
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:22,120
I'm running.

4703
02:48:22,220 --> 02:48:22,520
I'm running.

4704
02:48:23,060 --> 02:48:23,560
I'm running.

4705
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:24,460
I'm running.

4706
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:28,340
I'm running.

4707
02:48:28,340 --> 02:48:28,680
I'm splitting up.

4708
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:31,600
You have to kill one of us and it's not gonna be...

4709
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:33,120
It's gonna be me and you.

4710
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:37,120
We'll run away from Tempo just in case.

4711
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:38,360
I'm living.

4712
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:40,160
I'm behind somebody.

4713
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:41,040
That's not good.

4714
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:44,620
Alright.

4715
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:45,540
Hey, Tempo's alive.

4716
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:50,880
I wanna live in a house.

4717
02:48:51,740 --> 02:48:53,120
I would really like to...

4718
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,240
Alright, bleed out.

4719
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:54,660
Bleed out.

4720
02:48:56,020 --> 02:48:56,160
Oh, shit.

4721
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:56,580
Never mind.

4722
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,560
My hiding spot might be compromised now.

4723
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,960
Maybe we group up and go to the houses on the northwest side.

4724
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:05,820
Or northeast side.

4725
02:49:06,280 --> 02:49:07,920
Like, towards Yidoki.

4726
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:10,720
There's people living in this house, I think.

4727
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:11,580
I saw smoke.

4728
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:14,840
Yeah, we might want to group up.

4729
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:16,040
I think we have to group up.

4730
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:17,140
No, no, no.

4731
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:17,160
This is good.

4732
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:18,160
There's too many people alive.

4733
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:23,760
Yeah, I'm a little worried that you're landing right next to me.

4734
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:24,400
So...

4735
02:49:25,160 --> 02:49:26,120
It's probably okay.

4736
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:27,200
Okay.

4737
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:31,000
Are you sure there's people in the house on the right?

4738
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:32,140
People died right beside me.

4739
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:33,300
Okay, we could try.

4740
02:49:33,560 --> 02:49:35,740
I mean... They're now lobo-alting right beside me.

4741
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:37,160
Just show where you're at.

4742
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:38,780
I'll find out if there's people in this house.

4743
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:39,280
Okay.

4744
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:41,840
It got looted.

4745
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:42,820
That got looted.

4746
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:44,220
That got looted, Mike.

4747
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:46,360
There's people right there.

4748
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:47,060
Yeah, there's people on the left.

4749
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:47,840
This one's good.

4750
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:48,340
This one's good.

4751
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:50,940
Okay.

4752
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:52,320
They're just trying to control both.

4753
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:53,800
Alright, I'm heading to you.

4754
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:53,900
You should cue to me.

4755
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:54,380
Cue to me.

4756
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:54,440
Cue to me.

4757
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:54,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4758
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:55,800
I'm cueing to you.

4759
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:56,520
Cue in here.

4760
02:49:56,620 --> 02:49:56,860
Cue in here.

4761
02:49:57,580 --> 02:49:57,900
Cue!

4762
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:00,280
Tempo, you gotta find your way here.

4763
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:02,840
Survive.

4764
02:50:04,460 --> 02:50:06,100
Wait, unless the zone pulls to me.

4765
02:50:06,260 --> 02:50:07,240
In our fucking bottom floor!

4766
02:50:07,880 --> 02:50:08,540
What the fuck?

4767
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:08,760
Where?

4768
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:10,660
What the fuck?

4769
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:11,480
Alright, Tempo, live.

4770
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:12,080
Tempo, live!

4771
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:12,500
Tempo, live!

4772
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:13,220
This is your hope!

4773
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:14,180
Tempo, live!

4774
02:50:14,180 --> 02:50:15,740
They're just inside with no audio.

4775
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:16,560
Tempo, live!

4776
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:19,160
There's a yellow bin on the floor.

4777
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,320
43 seconds we are responding.

4778
02:50:21,580 --> 02:50:21,940
I'm fucked.

4779
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:22,680
I am dead.

4780
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:22,980
Tempo!

4781
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:24,500
There's a person right here about to loot this.

4782
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:25,880
Spotted a supply bin.

4783
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:27,140
Tempo?

4784
02:50:27,220 --> 02:50:27,980
30 seconds, Tempo.

4785
02:50:28,100 --> 02:50:28,660
Tempo, just...

4786
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:31,560
Just live for 30... Where's the timer on your death thingy?

4787
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:32,000
No pressure.

4788
02:50:32,180 --> 02:50:32,540
29.

4789
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:32,980
We'll count.

4790
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:36,060
We'll give you like 20, 10 second countdowns and stuff.

4791
02:50:36,300 --> 02:50:37,960
So like, it's 23.

4792
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:40,780
Do you want me to give you more pressure here?

4793
02:50:40,860 --> 02:50:41,560
I can count it down.

4794
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:46,800
Tempo, I don't know if you should move right now.

4795
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:48,020
The zone is not moving yet.

4796
02:50:50,320 --> 02:50:51,260
Okay, 10 seconds.

4797
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:53,120
We're gonna land on Tempo and we're gonna play here, I think.

4798
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:53,960
You're gonna land on me?

4799
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:54,240
What the fuck?

4800
02:50:55,260 --> 02:50:56,920
You're literally the only person alive!

4801
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:58,040
Of course we can land on you!

4802
02:50:58,980 --> 02:51:00,100
Yeah, we have nowhere to go.

4803
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:01,020
There's people everywhere.

4804
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,800
Oh, there's someone shooting right there.

4805
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:04,240
Alright.

4806
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:06,240
How are we landing this, man?

4807
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:09,940
We just land on Tempo and we have to shoot everybody to the south.

4808
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:11,060
Is that house taken?

4809
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:12,160
In front of us?

4810
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,180
Yes, everything's taken over there.

4811
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:15,460
We need to kill everybody to the south.

4812
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:16,000
That's all we can do.

4813
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,020
Yo, there's gold mudba.

4814
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:19,000
Tempo, you need to look at this.

4815
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:19,800
They're fighting over here.

4816
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:21,900
I don't have a...

4817
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:23,080
Tempo's dying.

4818
02:51:23,100 --> 02:51:23,600
Tempo's dying.

4819
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:26,360
Tempo's dead.

4820
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:28,020
Yeah, I'm dead.

4821
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:29,160
Where did you die from?

4822
02:51:31,060 --> 02:51:31,860
Over here.

4823
02:51:32,060 --> 02:51:33,360
I'm taking the yellow bins right now.

4824
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:35,480
I'm gonna try to have them.

4825
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:36,900
I got one of the yellow bins.

4826
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:40,560
I hear them.

4827
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,220
I hear them next to me.

4828
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:46,540
I got one of the yellow bins.

4829
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:48,000
Can we come to me?

4830
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:49,800
Yeah, I'm heading over.

4831
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:50,260
Stay with me.

4832
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:51,880
There's hella people behind us.

4833
02:51:51,980 --> 02:51:52,260
Okay.

4834
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:56,100
Tempo is healing.

4835
02:51:58,860 --> 02:52:01,240
I think we can maybe just waddle in over here, kinda.

4836
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:01,700
Okay.

4837
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:06,020
We're just gonna try to find a cozy little spot to squeak on in.

4838
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:09,520
Right here seems cozy enough.

4839
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:10,500
Okay.

4840
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:12,340
I'm gonna grab these bins.

4841
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:13,240
Stay there for a sec.

4842
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:15,320
I don't...

4843
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:16,700
I don't feel so cozy.

4844
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:20,040
I don't...

4845
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:21,600
Okay.

4846
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:22,960
And I'm trying to look around.

4847
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:23,760
I think... Come to me.

4848
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:24,020
Come to me.

4849
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:24,560
Okay.

4850
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:25,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4851
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:25,940
We got a spot.

4852
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:26,640
Come, come, come, come.

4853
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:27,380
Oh my god!

4854
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:28,480
Are we... Did we get real estate?

4855
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:29,640
We're in the pizza store.

4856
02:52:29,780 --> 02:52:30,480
Oh my god!

4857
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:31,500
We're in real estate!

4858
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:33,240
We can afford...

4859
02:52:33,240 --> 02:52:35,180
We can afford a place to live!

4860
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:37,480
Oh my god.

4861
02:52:37,480 --> 02:52:38,200
There's a team in here.

4862
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:39,360
Tempo, Knuckle, fuck them.

4863
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:39,940
They're fighting.

4864
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:40,480
They're fighting.

4865
02:52:41,400 --> 02:52:42,220
Get Q's in there.

4866
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:46,100
I'm trying to look, but I don't see anybody.

4867
02:52:46,320 --> 02:52:47,720
There's people up top peeking too.

4868
02:52:47,780 --> 02:52:47,980
Careful.

4869
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:49,580
Don't worry.

4870
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:51,540
The pizza place's glass can block bullets.

4871
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:53,260
I'm playing in the fucking bug.

4872
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:54,960
That's right, bitch!

4873
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:57,120
One HP inside.

4874
02:52:57,840 --> 02:52:58,700
Stay alive.

4875
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:00,440
I think we kill this team.

4876
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,600
Do I stay alive or...?

4877
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:03,640
No, no.

4878
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:04,340
Just commit to the fight.

4879
02:53:04,540 --> 02:53:06,260
It's a fucking rat race from up top.

4880
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:07,220
I'm chasing them.

4881
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:09,320
I don't see it.

4882
02:53:09,420 --> 02:53:10,240
It's smoked.

4883
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:12,280
Oh, another team!

4884
02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:12,820
Another team's coming!

4885
02:53:12,980 --> 02:53:13,880
Another team's pushing in.

4886
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:16,860
He jumped up.

4887
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:17,520
I knocked one up here.

4888
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:19,680
I'm in a different house.

4889
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:22,740
I'm in a different house, Dokie.

4890
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:24,140
I'm gonna grab loot, guys.

4891
02:53:24,620 --> 02:53:25,960
I'm in a different house, Dokie.

4892
02:53:26,540 --> 02:53:26,940
Hello.

4893
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:29,380
I believed in him.

4894
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:30,060
Oh, there's a...

4895
02:53:30,060 --> 02:53:30,700
Oh my god!

4896
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:32,000
There's a Kraber next to us.

4897
02:53:32,580 --> 02:53:33,800
No points for that, though.

4898
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:34,840
Yeah, but...

4899
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:37,040
We need points, yeah.

4900
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:38,040
But it's Kraber.

4901
02:53:40,920 --> 02:53:42,120
I'm trying to figure out what to get.

4902
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:42,760
Whoa!

4903
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:45,580
There's a gun shield generator.

4904
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,240
There's a bunch of energy bags here.

4905
02:53:47,640 --> 02:53:49,300
Okay, we need to find our walk-in.

4906
02:53:49,960 --> 02:53:50,320
Okay.

4907
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:53,520
I want to grab that, actually.

4908
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:54,400
There's someone above us.

4909
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:58,200
Oh my god.

4910
02:53:58,320 --> 02:53:58,860
Come to me.

4911
02:53:58,980 --> 02:53:59,140
Come to me.

4912
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:01,180
Be careful.

4913
02:54:01,780 --> 02:54:03,660
We still have to get up here.

4914
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:05,000
Just cue to me, Dokie.

4915
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:05,240
Cue to me.

4916
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:07,700
We're walking into this corner.

4917
02:54:07,860 --> 02:54:08,780
We're playing this side of the wall.

4918
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:09,640
Wait, there's people here.

4919
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:10,180
There's people landing.

4920
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:11,240
There's people landing this side.

4921
02:54:12,580 --> 02:54:13,380
Where's the audio?

4922
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:14,840
Nice.

4923
02:54:16,060 --> 02:54:16,560
Right here.

4924
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:19,060
Pop a bat, Dokie.

4925
02:54:19,060 --> 02:54:19,380
Pop a bat.

4926
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:20,100
What the fuck is going on?

4927
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:23,260
There's a guy right here.

4928
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:24,060
I'm blocking that.

4929
02:54:24,060 --> 02:54:24,400
I'm blocking that.

4930
02:54:24,460 --> 02:54:24,660
You're good.

4931
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:26,580
I can't block that.

4932
02:54:26,620 --> 02:54:27,180
I can't block that.

4933
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:27,640
It's in your ass.

4934
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:30,220
No, I'm trying to thirst him!

4935
02:54:30,380 --> 02:54:30,740
No!

4936
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:35,140
I almost got the thirst!

4937
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:36,220
I'm so sad!

4938
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:38,500
It was so close!

4939
02:54:38,500 --> 02:54:38,860
How did that Wraith get over?

4940
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:40,620
I just didn't hear anything.

4941
02:54:40,740 --> 02:54:41,740
He's just on my head.

4942
02:54:41,960 --> 02:54:42,500
Oh my god.

4943
02:54:42,520 --> 02:54:43,980
I almost got the thirst, too.

4944
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:46,080
We almost got the plus one.

4945
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:47,940
That's six points, though.

4946
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:49,500
How did we get six points?

4947
02:54:51,620 --> 02:54:52,400
Wait, did you get...

4948
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:53,540
One placement.

4949
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:56,600
Matt got three, I think, longbow kills.

4950
02:54:56,820 --> 02:54:58,500
Oh, did you get three longbow kills?

4951
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,460
Yeah, they're longbow all-star kills.

4952
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:02,820
That's great.

4953
02:55:02,880 --> 02:55:05,000
And then when we dropped on the other team at the very start.

4954
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:06,020
I'm so sad.

4955
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:06,800
I almost got that.

4956
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:07,660
Longbow all-star kill, too.

4957
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:11,060
I could've heard that.

4958
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:11,900
Yeah.

4959
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:15,900
He came out of nowhere.

4960
02:55:16,260 --> 02:55:17,300
I didn't see him either.

4961
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:21,080
Oh my god.

4962
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:21,940
We were so close.

4963
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:25,420
We were so close to another seven points.

4964
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:27,180
Wait, but that means...

4965
02:55:27,180 --> 02:55:29,220
Temple, how many points did we have last game?

4966
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:30,560
Oh, I have no idea.

4967
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:31,600
Okay.

4968
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:34,440
I zoned out.

4969
02:55:36,480 --> 02:55:38,180
I think we're at nine.

4970
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:40,320
We're at nine points?

4971
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:41,080
Yeah.

4972
02:55:41,260 --> 02:55:42,360
Now, or like...

4973
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:45,520
Or like, um...

4974
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:46,160
Before.

4975
02:55:57,860 --> 02:56:00,120
Whose house teammates again?

4976
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:03,980
Isn't the house teammates a TSM...

4977
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:05,360
One of the TSM players?

4978
02:56:05,720 --> 02:56:05,900
Yep.

4979
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:07,160
And...

4980
02:56:10,500 --> 02:56:11,760
Wait a minute.

4981
02:56:11,860 --> 02:56:13,060
You know the Dome game?

4982
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:14,680
Yeah.

4983
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:18,160
Did we die early?

4984
02:56:18,860 --> 02:56:19,660
What do you mean?

4985
02:56:19,880 --> 02:56:20,800
With one kill?

4986
02:56:21,220 --> 02:56:23,060
Yeah, we died with one kill, yeah.

4987
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:24,820
And we died early?

4988
02:56:25,260 --> 02:56:26,240
What do you mean by early?

4989
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:29,360
We landed in Dome.

4990
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:30,800
And survived in Dome.

4991
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:32,760
Like, did we get any placement points?

4992
02:56:32,760 --> 02:56:33,580
No.

4993
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:36,160
We got one, I think.

4994
02:56:36,300 --> 02:56:36,880
Plus one.

4995
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:37,520
I don't actually know.

4996
02:56:37,780 --> 02:56:38,220
Actually, no.

4997
02:56:38,300 --> 02:56:39,180
We died really early, yeah.

4998
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:41,600
Okay, so I think that adds it in.

4999
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:41,980
Okay.

5000
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:43,480
Are we gone?

5001
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:45,480
Where are we?

5002
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:53,900
What did we get?

5003
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:56,500
We're at 15.

5004
02:56:56,960 --> 02:56:58,200
We beat our record!

5005
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,560
We did it!

5006
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:02,020
My career is saved.

5007
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:04,680
We're better than Quake!

5008
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:06,420
We did it!

5009
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:09,800
Now we can cruise.

5010
02:57:09,920 --> 02:57:11,680
Now that we know we beat our record.

5011
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:19,620
Oh my god, I'm so proud of us!

5012
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:24,240
Now we double our points this next game.

5013
02:57:24,920 --> 02:57:27,180
Okay, that's a little bit too much confidence.

5014
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:29,560
We need second with six kills.

5015
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:33,040
It's a bit too much confidence.

5016
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:36,620
The best placement we got was top six.

5017
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:37,440
Top seven.

5018
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:38,900
Because you rat it.

5019
02:57:38,900 --> 02:57:40,300
Top two is imminent.

5020
02:57:42,120 --> 02:57:43,880
I mean, if we don't die early, maybe.

5021
02:57:46,480 --> 02:57:48,440
Maybe if we find a house early.

5022
02:57:48,540 --> 02:57:49,320
And a zone.

5023
02:57:52,410 --> 02:57:53,490
I wonder...

5024
02:57:54,530 --> 02:57:55,890
I wonder if Hal...

5025
02:57:55,890 --> 02:57:56,670
Did Hal die?

5026
02:57:57,490 --> 02:58:00,070
Or is his team okay?

5027
02:58:01,210 --> 02:58:02,230
I have no idea.

5028
02:58:04,070 --> 02:58:05,330
I have no idea.

5029
02:58:05,330 --> 02:58:07,570
Because that howling was pretty bad.

5030
02:58:16,180 --> 02:58:18,680
I hope they put the minus five to...

5031
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:22,340
I hope reps got the minus five.

5032
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:24,740
I hope they put the minus five to...

5033
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:24,940
Wait.

5034
02:58:26,580 --> 02:58:28,300
They said they were at what?

5035
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:28,800
Ten points?

5036
02:58:29,060 --> 02:58:30,640
Yeah, they were ten points, so he should have five points.

5037
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:35,020
People should not get special treatment.

5038
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:38,040
Timmy got minus five on the first game.

5039
02:58:45,550 --> 02:58:46,730
That's all I'm saying.

5040
02:58:47,690 --> 02:58:48,210
That's all I'm saying.

5041
02:58:48,210 --> 02:58:49,170
Oh, Jordan is with Clara.

5042
02:58:51,430 --> 02:58:51,950
Oh.

5043
02:58:52,910 --> 02:58:53,430
Oh.

5044
02:58:53,930 --> 02:58:54,450
Who?

5045
02:58:54,710 --> 02:58:55,450
They're at 18.

5046
02:58:55,870 --> 02:58:57,990
So if you minus five, they're at 13.

5047
02:58:58,870 --> 02:59:01,510
And if you plus R6, we're at 15.

5048
02:59:02,010 --> 02:59:02,530
And if you plus R6, we're at 15.

5049
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:03,970
So...

5050
02:59:04,530 --> 02:59:06,090
I mean, they could have placed higher.

5051
02:59:07,390 --> 02:59:08,730
They just needed to pick right.

5052
02:59:09,010 --> 02:59:09,050
They just needed to pick right.

5053
02:59:12,390 --> 02:59:12,910
Ahem.

5054
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:18,000
Oh my god, this is a tense game.

5055
02:59:19,460 --> 02:59:19,900
ALGS.

5056
02:59:28,210 --> 02:59:30,130
We just gotta make sure we don't get minus five.

5057
02:59:30,530 --> 02:59:31,410
And then...

5058
02:59:31,410 --> 02:59:32,710
This will be okay.

5059
02:59:37,400 --> 02:59:38,020
It's okay.

5060
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:39,600
Next game.

5061
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:42,140
Oh my god, how many nades are they throwing at this team?

5062
02:59:42,540 --> 02:59:43,140
Next game.

5063
02:59:43,240 --> 02:59:46,600
Oh, that

5064
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:54,800
rat.

5065
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:56,740
That rat lived for a long time.

5066
02:59:59,980 --> 03:00:01,400
What the fuck is going on?

5067
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:02,480
Madness might win here.

5068
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:04,440
Oh no, never mind.

5069
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:05,340
No, I think that's...

5070
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:08,200
That team has like 200,000 nades.

5071
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:09,180
Oh, he's gonna explode to that nade.

5072
03:00:09,380 --> 03:00:11,700
He's gonna get fucking sent to another planet.

5073
03:00:11,860 --> 03:00:12,580
I was gonna say.

5074
03:00:12,780 --> 03:00:14,620
That team has 200,000 nades.

5075
03:00:14,640 --> 03:00:16,380
I don't think he's gonna live.

5076
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:20,360
Madness team really used all their nades last game.

5077
03:00:20,580 --> 03:00:21,400
Or last fight.

5078
03:00:23,980 --> 03:00:24,460
Ahem.

5079
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:27,280
We have our Apex champions.

5080
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:28,480
Team 13.

5081
03:00:41,490 --> 03:00:42,010
Alright.

5082
03:00:43,330 --> 03:00:44,090
Let's see.

5083
03:00:44,110 --> 03:00:45,770
I wanna see where Hal placed.

5084
03:00:46,010 --> 03:00:47,290
To get that reaction.

5085
03:00:48,570 --> 03:00:49,290
Oh no.

5086
03:00:49,530 --> 03:00:51,350
What made him react like that?

5087
03:00:51,830 --> 03:00:53,270
Wait, where is...

5088
03:00:54,570 --> 03:00:55,570
Oh, top 10.

5089
03:00:55,730 --> 03:00:56,430
It's not that bad.

5090
03:00:56,470 --> 03:00:57,310
They got seven kills.

5091
03:00:59,310 --> 03:01:00,410
That's not that bad.

5092
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:01,330
Oh no.

5093
03:01:01,330 --> 03:01:03,730
Jordan got a bunch of placement points.

5094
03:01:03,890 --> 03:01:05,890
So that minus five does not help us.

5095
03:01:06,870 --> 03:01:08,130
Wait, which one is true?

5096
03:01:08,150 --> 03:01:09,230
Jordan is...

5097
03:01:09,230 --> 03:01:10,130
They got team three.

5098
03:01:10,410 --> 03:01:12,750
Holy shit, they got ten kills!

5099
03:01:14,350 --> 03:01:16,110
Which might not matter.

5100
03:01:17,470 --> 03:01:18,410
I don't know.

5101
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:20,550
Tech discord going to new lobby.

5102
03:01:20,710 --> 03:01:21,030
Okay.

5103
03:01:25,140 --> 03:01:26,060
Alright, pee break.

5104
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:28,200
You pee so much.

5105
03:01:30,540 --> 03:01:32,040
Oh, new lobby time.

5106
03:01:32,580 --> 03:01:34,200
He's been peeing every game.

5107
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:35,040
Like, that's...

5108
03:01:36,260 --> 03:01:37,600
That's not healthy, is it?

5109
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:40,140
It's probably healthy.

5110
03:01:40,580 --> 03:01:41,140
Is it healthy?

5111
03:01:41,220 --> 03:01:43,420
Peeing, like, every 20 minutes?

5112
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:45,880
Bro, just be pissing, man.

5113
03:01:46,820 --> 03:01:48,080
He's been pissing, man.

5114
03:01:48,480 --> 03:01:49,440
I don't think that's...

5115
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:50,800
I don't think that's it.

5116
03:01:52,060 --> 03:01:54,140
Depends how much water he's drinking, I guess.

5117
03:01:54,260 --> 03:01:54,640
I don't know.

5118
03:01:57,780 --> 03:01:59,620
It means you are hydrated.

5119
03:01:59,880 --> 03:02:01,280
But every 20 minutes?

5120
03:02:02,500 --> 03:02:04,300
Every 20 to 30 minutes?

5121
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:06,780
Hey man, you want to be dehydrated?

5122
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,520
That's up to you.

5123
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:11,480
Like, I hydrate, but not every 20 to 30 minutes.

5124
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:18,520
Temple's just locked in on the hydration, I guess.

5125
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:19,120
I guess so.

5126
03:02:19,340 --> 03:02:22,560
I guess that's how he does his number counting thing.

5127
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:24,920
He stays...

5128
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:27,760
The more hydrated he is, the better he counts.

5129
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:33,520
Alright.

5130
03:02:33,940 --> 03:02:35,180
Or it's all that Hulk piss.

5131
03:02:36,660 --> 03:02:37,480
Oh, that's true.

5132
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:38,740
The Hulk piss is just running through him.

5133
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:41,500
Guys, I have a new plan.

5134
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:43,480
Oh, here we go.

5135
03:02:43,860 --> 03:02:45,000
This is our last game.

5136
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:46,540
Are we still going dome?

5137
03:02:47,300 --> 03:02:47,660
Yeah.

5138
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:49,660
Okay, new plan.

5139
03:02:50,740 --> 03:02:51,780
We have a support.

5140
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:53,900
Wait, does dome get a crafter?

5141
03:02:56,340 --> 03:02:58,720
We don't even know what characters we're allowed to play yet.

5142
03:02:58,780 --> 03:02:59,140
Yeah, we do.

5143
03:02:59,240 --> 03:03:00,300
Yeah, they just posted it.

5144
03:03:00,300 --> 03:03:01,600
Oh yeah, you know what?

5145
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:02,060
You're right.

5146
03:03:02,140 --> 03:03:02,620
I'll shut up.

5147
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:03,560
New plan.

5148
03:03:04,220 --> 03:03:05,600
Does dome get a crafter?

5149
03:03:05,720 --> 03:03:06,140
Do you know?

5150
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:07,520
Yeah, it can.

5151
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:10,000
It can?

5152
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:11,140
You mean it's not guaranteed?

5153
03:03:12,180 --> 03:03:13,280
No crafters are guaranteed.

5154
03:03:13,800 --> 03:03:15,040
Oh, interesting.

5155
03:03:15,720 --> 03:03:16,200
Alright.

5156
03:03:16,240 --> 03:03:17,460
But you should know this, Tempo.

5157
03:03:17,860 --> 03:03:19,000
Why should I know that?

5158
03:03:19,140 --> 03:03:19,880
I'm not playing.

5159
03:03:20,240 --> 03:03:22,760
You organize the screens and stuff.

5160
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:24,880
So the plan is...

5161
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:26,060
We grab a support.

5162
03:03:26,360 --> 03:03:29,360
Two of us land in Skyhook or Frag.

5163
03:03:30,140 --> 03:03:31,940
Get the two free bonus points.

5164
03:03:32,060 --> 03:03:33,340
If we kill someone, great.

5165
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:35,040
If we don't, doesn't matter.

5166
03:03:35,220 --> 03:03:38,020
Because then the third person can craft us back at dome.

5167
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:39,400
And boom.

5168
03:03:39,480 --> 03:03:40,740
We start the game with two points.

5169
03:03:41,380 --> 03:03:41,940
Hmm.

5170
03:03:42,940 --> 03:03:43,900
Five head.

5171
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:46,940
But what if we don't have crafter?

5172
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:49,140
If we get a crafter?

5173
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:50,320
Then yeah, go for it.

5174
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:51,480
Oh, you're right.

5175
03:03:51,540 --> 03:03:53,700
We can choose after.

5176
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:54,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5177
03:03:56,660 --> 03:03:58,320
Come on, crafter.

5178
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:02,220
But who are the ones that are landing there?

5179
03:04:02,660 --> 03:04:04,440
I think we play...

5180
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:07,680
Gibby...

5181
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:09,440
Watson...

5182
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:12,180
Oh, I like Watson.

5183
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:13,420
And...

5184
03:04:15,180 --> 03:04:15,680
Maggie.

5185
03:04:16,960 --> 03:04:17,460
Okay.

5186
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:19,760
And what are you playing, Mac?

5187
03:04:20,200 --> 03:04:21,440
I will play Gibby.

5188
03:04:21,700 --> 03:04:23,720
Okay, and then I'll play Maggie then.

5189
03:04:24,360 --> 03:04:24,860
Yeah.

5190
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:26,740
It's a Watson that blends into World's Edge.

5191
03:04:27,220 --> 03:04:27,720
Alright.

5192
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:28,720
Oh, I look like lava.

5193
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:29,580
Where is she?

5194
03:04:29,740 --> 03:04:31,720
I always forget where she is on the screen.

5195
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:35,540
Alright, new code.

5196
03:04:36,280 --> 03:04:37,080
New code.

5197
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:44,060
Last game, guys.

5198
03:04:44,620 --> 03:04:45,220
Last game.

5199
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:47,240
I need less shiny.

5200
03:04:47,320 --> 03:04:50,540
So, is Tempo our safe line again?

5201
03:04:51,960 --> 03:04:54,180
Or are you our safe line, Mac?

5202
03:04:54,380 --> 03:04:55,200
Yeah, Tempo is.

5203
03:04:55,220 --> 03:04:55,640
Tempo is?

5204
03:04:55,700 --> 03:04:56,740
So I'm landing with you?

5205
03:04:57,400 --> 03:04:58,620
I want to grief people.

5206
03:04:58,820 --> 03:04:59,620
No, Tempo.

5207
03:04:59,620 --> 03:05:00,680
You're Watson.

5208
03:05:00,860 --> 03:05:01,600
You're going to stay in the dome.

5209
03:05:01,900 --> 03:05:02,780
You're going to be a...

5210
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:04,820
If there's a crafter.

5211
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,100
Oh, wait.

5212
03:05:06,140 --> 03:05:07,980
Just in that small circle.

5213
03:05:09,220 --> 03:05:09,700
What?

5214
03:05:09,700 --> 03:05:11,520
You have to land in the skyhook.

5215
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:12,340
I mean, we could do Fragment West.

5216
03:05:12,500 --> 03:05:13,860
You have to land right in the middle.

5217
03:05:13,960 --> 03:05:15,240
Yeah, but we could do Fragment West.

5218
03:05:15,280 --> 03:05:15,660
It's easier.

5219
03:05:15,940 --> 03:05:16,520
Wait a minute.

5220
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:17,800
That's not even Fragment West.

5221
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:18,700
That's just Fragment.

5222
03:05:19,420 --> 03:05:19,780
What?

5223
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:23,320
There's no more West.

5224
03:05:23,840 --> 03:05:24,660
It's just Fragment.

5225
03:05:27,020 --> 03:05:28,260
Five head plan, guys.

5226
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:29,080
Two free points.

5227
03:05:29,140 --> 03:05:29,680
Let's do it.

5228
03:05:30,340 --> 03:05:30,700
Alright.

5229
03:05:32,420 --> 03:05:32,780
Yippee.

5230
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:36,340
I'm so ready.

5231
03:05:36,340 --> 03:05:38,120
I'm so, I'm so ready.

5232
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:39,680
We going Mon.

5233
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:42,240
We going Mon if go Frag West.

5234
03:05:42,340 --> 03:05:43,060
I'll cry later.

5235
03:05:44,580 --> 03:05:45,680
I'm so ready.

5236
03:05:46,100 --> 03:05:47,180
I don't even know who that is.

5237
03:05:50,900 --> 03:05:51,740
This is it.

5238
03:05:52,480 --> 03:05:53,760
The final countdown.

5239
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:55,680
The final game.

5240
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:57,620
The final countdown.

5241
03:05:57,680 --> 03:05:58,780
And then we'll be free.

5242
03:06:07,640 --> 03:06:08,300
Oh, wait.

5243
03:06:08,380 --> 03:06:09,660
They actually put minus points.

5244
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:10,720
Wait, they did?

5245
03:06:11,180 --> 03:06:11,620
Yeah!

5246
03:06:14,340 --> 03:06:14,780
Wait.

5247
03:06:15,400 --> 03:06:16,340
How do you know?

5248
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:17,280
12, 9.

5249
03:06:19,620 --> 03:06:21,160
How do you know they got minus 5?

5250
03:06:21,980 --> 03:06:25,500
Because I'm looking at the scores and there's a team that has negative 2 in one of the games.

5251
03:06:27,080 --> 03:06:27,520
Oh!

5252
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:31,680
Rampage, triple take this game.

5253
03:06:32,220 --> 03:06:32,660
Rampage, triple take this game.

5254
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:33,700
Wait, in one of the games?

5255
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:35,340
Like the last game or like the beginning?

5256
03:06:36,340 --> 03:06:37,180
The last game wasn't added yet.

5257
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:38,600
One of the beginning games, yeah.

5258
03:06:38,820 --> 03:06:39,240
Oh, okay.

5259
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:40,000
One of the beginning games.

5260
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:42,260
Okay, I was going to be like, oh my god, someone's still 90.

5261
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:45,520
Wait.

5262
03:06:45,940 --> 03:06:46,660
Rampage, triple take?

5263
03:06:46,660 --> 03:06:47,580
Girls 18th place?

5264
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:48,920
Are we 20th place?

5265
03:06:49,760 --> 03:06:50,120
19.

5266
03:06:50,960 --> 03:06:52,760
Okay, can we do better than girls team?

5267
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:55,160
Wait, if we get two points here?

5268
03:06:55,280 --> 03:06:56,300
If we get two points here?

5269
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:56,960
Wait, where are we in?

5270
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:58,240
We're 19th.

5271
03:06:58,380 --> 03:07:01,060
Guys, that's the same placement as Wig, guys.

5272
03:07:03,100 --> 03:07:04,840
We just need... guys, guys.

5273
03:07:06,340 --> 03:07:07,540
Last game wasn't included, that's why.

5274
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:09,000
Oh, okay.

5275
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:11,360
So it could be better or it could be worse.

5276
03:07:11,480 --> 03:07:15,240
Guys, I just want to be better than the team above me.

5277
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:15,420
I'm fiving.

5278
03:07:15,420 --> 03:07:17,560
And apparently the team above me is girls team.

5279
03:07:17,800 --> 03:07:18,740
So I just...

5280
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:20,740
How far is the gap?

5281
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:23,860
Is it durable tempo if we win?

5282
03:07:24,020 --> 03:07:26,740
If we land on frag, that's two points.

5283
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:28,600
Yeah, but they're going to land on frag too.

5284
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:29,680
That's not what I asked.

5285
03:07:29,820 --> 03:07:31,060
That's not what I asked.

5286
03:07:31,060 --> 03:07:32,900
They might not know.

5287
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:35,600
Wait, who's 20th place?

5288
03:07:35,740 --> 03:07:37,000
And we're 19th.

5289
03:07:37,060 --> 03:07:38,500
We're the fucking 20th.

5290
03:07:38,540 --> 03:07:39,860
How far are we from top 10?

5291
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:41,660
It's one of the teams that got negative five.

5292
03:07:43,160 --> 03:07:43,940
Wait, Timmy?

5293
03:07:47,540 --> 03:07:48,520
No, Julie's team.

5294
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:49,780
Oh, Julie's team, sure.

5295
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:52,500
Okay, we have to be above sure force team.

5296
03:07:52,560 --> 03:07:53,300
That's all I care about.

5297
03:07:53,620 --> 03:07:55,400
That's literally all I care about.

5298
03:07:55,440 --> 03:07:57,200
We have to be above sure force team.

5299
03:07:57,340 --> 03:07:59,860
I need a gloat.

5300
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:02,740
We got three points for Hotspot game two.

5301
03:08:04,080 --> 03:08:05,960
We got one point for Hotspot.

5302
03:08:06,060 --> 03:08:06,160
We got one point for Hotspot.

5303
03:08:06,300 --> 03:08:08,900
Wait, what did we do last game?

5304
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:09,840
We got one point for Hotspot.

5305
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:09,880
Wait, what did we do last game?

5306
03:08:14,160 --> 03:08:16,420
Wait, they gave negative five points?

5307
03:08:17,240 --> 03:08:18,680
Jeez, how many...

5308
03:08:18,680 --> 03:08:19,620
Wait, there's more than one.

5309
03:08:19,760 --> 03:08:20,740
I know like three teams.

5310
03:08:20,760 --> 03:08:23,380
Why did three teams get negative five last game?

5311
03:08:23,900 --> 03:08:24,580
Wait, one?

5312
03:08:24,940 --> 03:08:26,320
And we're still...

5313
03:08:30,900 --> 03:08:32,140
This is brilliant.

5314
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:33,320
We are trying our best.

5315
03:08:33,340 --> 03:08:38,360
We are trying our best to make sure everyone gets the negatives that they deserve.

5316
03:08:40,760 --> 03:08:42,360
Alright, come on, give us Crafter.

5317
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:44,180
Give us Crafter.

5318
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:45,620
Money, money, money.

5319
03:08:47,080 --> 03:08:48,220
Yeah, we're all here.

5320
03:08:48,620 --> 03:08:49,400
Ready up.

5321
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:52,020
I hate these like in-betweens every...

5322
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:52,940
I feel like...

5323
03:08:52,940 --> 03:09:00,780
I don't know this Twitch rivals thing, but I hate it when they take like 20 fucking years to start a game in between.

5324
03:09:01,320 --> 03:09:09,300
You think everyone's been doing this The entire time, in the normal games, two people landing and then crafting?

5325
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:10,520
No, because there's no fucking hot drop.

5326
03:09:11,140 --> 03:09:12,320
No, there is hot drop.

5327
03:09:12,460 --> 03:09:14,980
No, I meant like extra points.

5328
03:09:14,980 --> 03:09:16,160
Oh, you mean the extra points.

5329
03:09:16,620 --> 03:09:18,220
The bonus points for the landing.

5330
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:20,740
We just only figured it out at game 6?

5331
03:09:21,300 --> 03:09:22,660
Yes, because we're stupid.

5332
03:09:24,200 --> 03:09:26,220
This is not the team that's going to win.

5333
03:09:26,260 --> 03:09:27,340
This is the Vibes team.

5334
03:09:27,440 --> 03:09:28,660
The Vibes team don't think.

5335
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:35,680
This is why I don't want to be captain.

5336
03:09:35,900 --> 03:09:38,140
Literally when I was picking, I was just like, who do I know?

5337
03:09:38,320 --> 03:09:39,360
And I know I vibe well.

5338
03:09:41,700 --> 03:09:45,540
Because I was like, I don't know who these people are.

5339
03:09:46,460 --> 03:09:50,060
I put the dead fly in one of the empty drinks.

5340
03:09:50,960 --> 03:09:51,380
Why?

5341
03:09:52,840 --> 03:09:54,820
I don't have a garbage can here.

5342
03:09:54,900 --> 03:09:56,900
Why would you put it in your drink?

5343
03:09:57,700 --> 03:09:58,560
Because it was empty.

5344
03:09:58,660 --> 03:09:59,700
Oh, okay.

5345
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:01,220
And I was going to throw it out.

5346
03:10:01,580 --> 03:10:04,200
But then I forgot and I almost drank it.

5347
03:10:04,700 --> 03:10:05,820
Oh my god.

5348
03:10:05,840 --> 03:10:08,760
This is why you don't put it in empty.

5349
03:10:09,320 --> 03:10:11,120
Because I don't put it in the can.

5350
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:12,540
I drank it and I was like, wait a minute.

5351
03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:13,620
Did I put the fly in there?

5352
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:14,340
And I was like, oh wait.

5353
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:16,140
Someone said extra protein.

5354
03:10:16,900 --> 03:10:19,860
Alright, so let me move these cans away so I don't accidentally drink it.

5355
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:20,880
How many cans do you have there?

5356
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:22,600
I heard...

5357
03:10:22,600 --> 03:10:23,760
I'm at three cans.

5358
03:10:24,620 --> 03:10:25,220
Red Bull?

5359
03:10:26,100 --> 03:10:26,500
Yeah.

5360
03:10:27,080 --> 03:10:28,160
Bro, what the fuck?

5361
03:10:29,500 --> 03:10:30,340
I'm locked.

5362
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:32,940
No, you are not.

5363
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:36,300
I'm locked in.

5364
03:10:36,620 --> 03:10:38,020
After three cans.

5365
03:10:38,060 --> 03:10:38,380
Wait, ready?

5366
03:10:39,500 --> 03:10:41,560
I gotta move this over here.

5367
03:10:46,800 --> 03:10:50,280
Maybe this is why you're peeing every fucking 20 to 30 minutes.

5368
03:10:54,920 --> 03:10:57,180
Your fucking poor kidneys, man.

5369
03:10:57,440 --> 03:10:58,040
I'm locked in.

5370
03:10:58,040 --> 03:10:59,180
Wait, kidneys?

5371
03:10:59,500 --> 03:11:00,180
Isn't that alcohol?

5372
03:11:00,740 --> 03:11:02,660
At least one person from each team...

5373
03:11:02,660 --> 03:11:06,620
Wait, one person from each team has to hit ready to signify we're ready?

5374
03:11:06,740 --> 03:11:07,620
I wasn't even...

5375
03:11:07,620 --> 03:11:08,240
I didn't notice that.

5376
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:09,300
I was always ready.

5377
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:16,600
Don't worry guys, I got our team readied up.

5378
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:17,720
I don't.

5379
03:11:22,530 --> 03:11:23,510
What the fuck?

5380
03:11:26,210 --> 03:11:27,350
Who isn't readied?

5381
03:11:28,410 --> 03:11:29,230
Everybody's readied.

5382
03:11:30,110 --> 03:11:30,630
Yeah.

5383
03:11:30,730 --> 03:11:33,850
Everyone has... well, you said only one person needs to readied.

5384
03:11:33,850 --> 03:11:33,870
Yeah.

5385
03:11:34,130 --> 03:11:35,310
So what are you waiting for?

5386
03:11:35,450 --> 03:11:35,990
We're all good.

5387
03:11:37,090 --> 03:11:38,590
Click the go button?

5388
03:11:39,890 --> 03:11:41,230
I'm Mad Maggie, right?

5389
03:11:41,910 --> 03:11:43,490
Come on, crafter!

5390
03:11:44,850 --> 03:11:46,150
Gimme, gimme, crafter, gimme.

5391
03:11:46,410 --> 03:11:47,550
We're not even in game.

5392
03:11:47,930 --> 03:11:48,870
Yeah, you're Maggie.

5393
03:11:49,230 --> 03:11:49,750
Yay.

5394
03:11:50,670 --> 03:11:52,250
Where are the guns this time?

5395
03:11:55,010 --> 03:11:56,030
Rampage triple take?

5396
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:56,850
Oh!

5397
03:11:58,250 --> 03:11:59,650
I'll get the triple take.

5398
03:12:04,400 --> 03:12:07,260
I hope the bottom five teams get a minus five.

5399
03:12:07,460 --> 03:12:08,140
But not us.

5400
03:12:10,340 --> 03:12:12,660
Do all of us have our characters readied?

5401
03:12:12,860 --> 03:12:13,400
Yup.

5402
03:12:14,020 --> 03:12:15,640
What's your character, Tempo?

5403
03:12:19,300 --> 03:12:19,840
Tempo?

5404
03:12:23,510 --> 03:12:24,050
Tempo?

5405
03:12:24,210 --> 03:12:25,030
What's your character?

5406
03:12:27,130 --> 03:12:28,050
I'm scared.

5407
03:12:37,090 --> 03:12:38,370
Wait, 14th place?

5408
03:12:38,510 --> 03:12:39,610
Tempo has 18 points.

5409
03:12:40,670 --> 03:12:41,150
Wait.

5410
03:12:42,110 --> 03:12:43,690
How far away is top ten?

5411
03:12:43,810 --> 03:12:46,550
I asked like four times, Tempo ignored me and I gave up.

5412
03:12:48,510 --> 03:12:52,250
And he was like, I'm locked in.

5413
03:12:54,190 --> 03:12:55,810
Alright guys, can you hear me?

5414
03:12:56,210 --> 03:12:57,450
Yeah, what happened?

5415
03:12:58,230 --> 03:12:58,890
I'm ready.

5416
03:12:59,510 --> 03:13:00,810
Tempo, how far is top ten?

5417
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:06,430
I hate this guy.

5418
03:13:06,670 --> 03:13:07,690
Wait, I'm refreshing.

5419
03:13:08,510 --> 03:13:09,850
I actually hate this guy.

5420
03:13:11,230 --> 03:13:13,790
The points aren't refreshed yet, we don't know.

5421
03:13:15,990 --> 03:13:17,590
Game five is not ready yet.

5422
03:13:22,570 --> 03:13:23,670
We got this.

5423
03:13:23,930 --> 03:13:24,850
Tempo, what are you playing?

5424
03:13:24,890 --> 03:13:25,370
I forgot.

5425
03:13:27,590 --> 03:13:29,330
You wanna play a little game?

5426
03:13:30,170 --> 03:13:30,390
Huh?

5427
03:13:33,970 --> 03:13:35,210
He's playing Wacom.

5428
03:13:37,210 --> 03:13:37,930
I think.

5429
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:39,550
He's playing Wacom.

5430
03:13:39,690 --> 03:13:40,670
Alright, he's locked.

5431
03:13:41,670 --> 03:13:42,450
Where's me?

5432
03:13:42,930 --> 03:13:43,570
Alright.

5433
03:13:50,980 --> 03:13:52,600
There he is on Wacom.

5434
03:13:53,960 --> 03:13:55,040
I'm a little worried.

5435
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,060
Oh, there he goes.

5436
03:13:59,300 --> 03:14:02,240
Tempo is locked into a different dimension.

5437
03:14:03,900 --> 03:14:04,880
I am.

5438
03:14:06,460 --> 03:14:07,120
Look.

5439
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:09,420
Look what?

5440
03:14:09,420 --> 03:14:11,680
If you open the stream, you can see.

5441
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:13,920
How locked I am.

5442
03:14:13,980 --> 03:14:14,660
Oh, no.

5443
03:14:14,860 --> 03:14:17,480
I don't know if I want to at this point.

5444
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:18,460
We have a crafter.

5445
03:14:18,900 --> 03:14:19,620
Land there.

5446
03:14:21,240 --> 03:14:23,160
Land there and fuck them.

5447
03:14:23,520 --> 03:14:23,880
What the fuck, Tempo?

5448
03:14:23,980 --> 03:14:25,600
How are you gonna see?

5449
03:14:27,060 --> 03:14:29,220
Yo, donkey.

5450
03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:31,820
Peel, peel, peel.

5451
03:14:32,540 --> 03:14:33,200
I'm fucked.

5452
03:14:33,260 --> 03:14:34,280
I'm not gonna make it.

5453
03:14:34,360 --> 03:14:35,160
I'm not gonna make it.

5454
03:14:35,680 --> 03:14:36,660
Oh, no.

5455
03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:38,060
I'm not gonna make it.

5456
03:14:38,140 --> 03:14:39,960
Why did you click?

5457
03:14:40,360 --> 03:14:41,460
I was trying to fucking...

5458
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:43,040
It's fine.

5459
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:43,900
Do what you wanna do.

5460
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:45,620
I'll handle business and money.

5461
03:14:46,320 --> 03:14:47,280
Why, Tempo?

5462
03:14:47,360 --> 03:14:51,720
I was jump leader and I had to fucking give away the jump leader.

5463
03:14:52,380 --> 03:14:53,460
How are you jump leader?

5464
03:14:53,940 --> 03:14:54,540
Don't worry.

5465
03:14:54,600 --> 03:14:55,180
I'm handling business.

5466
03:14:55,500 --> 03:14:56,820
Why did you click?

5467
03:14:58,820 --> 03:15:01,200
I couldn't fucking separate myself.

5468
03:15:02,100 --> 03:15:03,180
I got triple landed on.

5469
03:15:03,280 --> 03:15:04,100
I'm sent to Narnia.

5470
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:04,640
Let's go, baby.

5471
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:06,180
Okay, at least like...

5472
03:15:06,180 --> 03:15:07,080
Oh, shit.

5473
03:15:07,540 --> 03:15:08,020
Hang on.

5474
03:15:08,060 --> 03:15:08,580
I'm gonna try to get a kill.

5475
03:15:10,680 --> 03:15:11,360
I got you.

5476
03:15:11,440 --> 03:15:11,720
I'm ready.

5477
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:13,580
I'm ready.

5478
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:14,500
He's ready.

5479
03:15:14,580 --> 03:15:15,820
He's locked in the craft.

5480
03:15:20,180 --> 03:15:20,540
Alright,

5481
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:24,880
at least we got that plus one.

5482
03:15:29,500 --> 03:15:29,860
Okay.

5483
03:15:30,400 --> 03:15:30,760
Alright.

5484
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:31,960
Alright.

5485
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:35,680
I crafted a bat.

5486
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,360
Are you real, Tempo?

5487
03:15:38,360 --> 03:15:39,460
No, he crafted it.

5488
03:15:39,820 --> 03:15:40,280
Okay.

5489
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:44,300
Did you see his stream?

5490
03:15:44,800 --> 03:15:45,260
No.

5491
03:15:45,900 --> 03:15:48,180
Okay, open his stream while you're respawning.

5492
03:15:56,200 --> 03:15:57,020
I'll look after.

5493
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:58,280
I gotta stay locked in this game.

5494
03:15:58,520 --> 03:16:00,000
Bro, he doesn't have Vons on.

5495
03:16:00,980 --> 03:16:01,620
Yeah, yeah.

5496
03:16:01,720 --> 03:16:03,440
I had to wait for him to turn it off.

5497
03:16:04,380 --> 03:16:05,240
Wait, what do you mean?

5498
03:16:06,820 --> 03:16:09,280
I need a triple take, guys.

5499
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:10,480
You guys find one.

5500
03:16:10,800 --> 03:16:11,920
I need a rampage.

5501
03:16:13,120 --> 03:16:14,080
Wait, where did it go?

5502
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:14,680
Isn't it...

5503
03:16:14,680 --> 03:16:16,020
Oh yeah, it's triple take rampage.

5504
03:16:16,100 --> 03:16:16,280
Yeah.

5505
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:19,440
Oh my god.

5506
03:16:19,680 --> 03:16:19,940
Hmm.

5507
03:16:22,180 --> 03:16:23,940
I don't think we're gonna...

5508
03:16:24,820 --> 03:16:26,100
Yo, we got one point.

5509
03:16:26,180 --> 03:16:26,820
What do you mean?

5510
03:16:27,080 --> 03:16:28,140
Why are you doubting?

5511
03:16:28,240 --> 03:16:29,820
We're gonna get the top 10 off this game.

5512
03:16:30,100 --> 03:16:30,540
Okay.

5513
03:16:30,900 --> 03:16:33,220
Locked, cocked, and ready to go.

5514
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:35,100
Tempo can barely see, like...

5515
03:16:35,100 --> 03:16:37,080
see right now with what he's wearing.

5516
03:16:37,900 --> 03:16:38,600
What do you mean?

5517
03:16:39,280 --> 03:16:40,320
Is he wearing the fucking Batman mask?

5518
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:41,740
I found a rampage.

5519
03:16:41,800 --> 03:16:45,080
He has a Batman mask?

5520
03:16:45,740 --> 03:16:46,740
Oh, Batman.

5521
03:16:47,500 --> 03:16:49,240
Okay, I'll just say that, like...

5522
03:16:49,240 --> 03:16:50,640
He has more than...

5523
03:16:50,640 --> 03:16:52,540
Mac, he has more than one mask.

5524
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:58,340
Is he wearing like a...

5525
03:16:58,340 --> 03:17:02,080
If I open this stream and he's wearing like a Gimp mask or something, bro?

5526
03:17:02,360 --> 03:17:03,520
I mean...

5527
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:05,440
You could say that.

5528
03:17:07,980 --> 03:17:08,460
Okay.

5529
03:17:09,280 --> 03:17:10,360
We lost for like two seconds.

5530
03:17:11,080 --> 03:17:14,620
I see team in stacks and they're fighting someone else.

5531
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:17,700
Sounds like a Gimp mask.

5532
03:17:20,560 --> 03:17:25,540
If you find me, like, two Mozabs, I can give you... give somebody two P20s.

5533
03:17:27,520 --> 03:17:28,080
Ooh.

5534
03:17:28,240 --> 03:17:29,240
What the fuck?

5535
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:30,820
Did you see it?

5536
03:17:32,840 --> 03:17:34,320
He is locked in.

5537
03:17:36,260 --> 03:17:37,100
That's what I'm saying.

5538
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:38,780
I was gonna fucking see anything.

5539
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:39,540
Wait, wait.

5540
03:17:39,580 --> 03:17:40,720
Stacks might fly on us.

5541
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:41,120
I'm watching.

5542
03:17:41,980 --> 03:17:42,380
Alright.

5543
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:47,240
Why are there no rampages here, man?

5544
03:17:47,460 --> 03:17:49,200
Does anyone wanna take my P20?

5545
03:17:49,980 --> 03:17:50,780
Double P20?

5546
03:17:51,700 --> 03:17:52,100
No.

5547
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:53,280
No.

5548
03:17:57,160 --> 03:17:58,460
I have a gold light mag.

5549
03:17:58,460 --> 03:17:59,740
Let's go get the stream console.

5550
03:18:00,140 --> 03:18:00,540
Okay.

5551
03:18:00,580 --> 03:18:01,860
I have a gold light mag.

5552
03:18:02,060 --> 03:18:02,840
Does anyone want that?

5553
03:18:03,520 --> 03:18:03,920
No.

5554
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:04,220
There's...

5555
03:18:04,320 --> 03:18:06,580
There's still fighting in stacks, so we should be okay.

5556
03:18:06,900 --> 03:18:06,900
Yeah.

5557
03:18:06,940 --> 03:18:07,540
Yeah, yeah.

5558
03:18:07,580 --> 03:18:08,180
We just hit this.

5559
03:18:08,240 --> 03:18:08,700
It'll be fine.

5560
03:18:08,860 --> 03:18:09,580
They won't see us.

5561
03:18:10,620 --> 03:18:13,040
I mean, maybe we can just, like, get involved and get in some ass.

5562
03:18:13,160 --> 03:18:13,780
No, no, no.

5563
03:18:13,820 --> 03:18:14,140
Let's not.

5564
03:18:14,160 --> 03:18:14,720
Let's not get involved.

5565
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:15,760
Let's not get involved, guys.

5566
03:18:15,920 --> 03:18:19,900
Remember, every time... every time we got involved, we got fucked over.

5567
03:18:21,440 --> 03:18:23,980
Mac, Mac, every time we got involved, we got fucked over.

5568
03:18:23,980 --> 03:18:24,940
I can kill a Wattson here.

5569
03:18:26,980 --> 03:18:27,880
Are they on the roof?

5570
03:18:28,080 --> 03:18:28,540
Yeah, right here.

5571
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:30,560
Mmm, okay.

5572
03:18:32,180 --> 03:18:33,100
Come on, Kobe.

5573
03:18:34,760 --> 03:18:35,620
Why are you...

5574
03:18:35,620 --> 03:18:37,340
I can't stand this guy.

5575
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:38,240
Alright, let's walk away.

5576
03:18:38,340 --> 03:18:39,220
Tempo gave us away.

5577
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:40,880
This is what I was saying.

5578
03:18:42,180 --> 03:18:45,920
We could have 3-2-1-1 in the back and Tempo's like, fuck it, dude, throw the grenade.

5579
03:18:46,200 --> 03:18:48,780
Like, bro, you're actually just a Borderlands character.

5580
03:18:49,260 --> 03:18:49,660
Didn't they have a Wattson on?

5581
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:50,100
Yeah, they did.

5582
03:18:50,120 --> 03:18:51,960
He threw it right into their gen and did nothing.

5583
03:18:52,380 --> 03:18:53,440
Oh, they had a gen?

5584
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:53,980
Yeah!

5585
03:18:54,420 --> 03:18:55,600
I was looking at it!

5586
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:57,920
They were, like, fenced up with gens and everything, bro.

5587
03:18:58,100 --> 03:18:58,380
Where do we go?

5588
03:18:58,380 --> 03:19:00,120
This unfortunate series of events.

5589
03:19:00,960 --> 03:19:01,360
Tempo...

5590
03:19:01,360 --> 03:19:03,060
This guy's actually just a Borderlands character.

5591
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:06,400
Joke's on you.

5592
03:19:06,620 --> 03:19:08,440
I don't know what that is supposed to mean.

5593
03:19:08,740 --> 03:19:09,460
What do you mean?

5594
03:19:09,520 --> 03:19:10,580
Do you not know Borderlands?

5595
03:19:10,900 --> 03:19:11,300
No.

5596
03:19:11,400 --> 03:19:12,500
The movie that failed?

5597
03:19:15,080 --> 03:19:16,520
I've never played that game.

5598
03:19:17,100 --> 03:19:18,880
You've heard of that game, right?

5599
03:19:20,140 --> 03:19:20,540
Yeah.

5600
03:19:21,360 --> 03:19:22,160
Okay, alright.

5601
03:19:22,520 --> 03:19:23,320
I still don't know what it's about.

5602
03:19:23,320 --> 03:19:23,900
It's your kind of humor.

5603
03:19:24,960 --> 03:19:25,880
You would like it.

5604
03:19:28,080 --> 03:19:30,080
That's the best way we can describe it.

5605
03:19:30,500 --> 03:19:30,980
Yeah.

5606
03:19:32,320 --> 03:19:34,180
Where are we going, Max?

5607
03:19:34,540 --> 03:19:35,400
Towards zone.

5608
03:19:35,560 --> 03:19:38,400
We're gonna go grab this assault bin and this Evo.

5609
03:19:38,520 --> 03:19:39,340
Maybe the support bin.

5610
03:19:39,340 --> 03:19:40,400
Didn't somebody land there?

5611
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:43,080
Yeah, but they've probably fucked off.

5612
03:19:43,300 --> 03:19:44,600
If they haven't, then I mean...

5613
03:19:44,600 --> 03:19:45,220
Yeah.

5614
03:19:45,320 --> 03:19:48,600
It is what it is.

5615
03:19:49,340 --> 03:19:49,820
Okay.

5616
03:19:50,020 --> 03:19:51,420
It'll be fine.

5617
03:19:52,120 --> 03:19:53,580
Don't think too much.

5618
03:19:55,880 --> 03:19:57,020
We're a tanking team anyway, so you're right.

5619
03:19:57,120 --> 03:19:57,520
Oh, Rampage!

5620
03:19:58,240 --> 03:19:59,000
I got one.

5621
03:19:59,240 --> 03:20:01,740
Yeah, you might want one.

5622
03:20:02,240 --> 03:20:03,320
Yeah, I'll get it now.

5623
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:05,020
I'm ready as well.

5624
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:10,200
Alright.

5625
03:20:16,750 --> 03:20:18,830
Where the fuck are the triple takes?

5626
03:20:20,790 --> 03:20:21,810
Keep moving, gentlemen.

5627
03:20:21,990 --> 03:20:22,470
Keep moving.

5628
03:20:23,030 --> 03:20:23,790
Oh, okay.

5629
03:20:25,890 --> 03:20:26,610
We're moving.

5630
03:20:27,250 --> 03:20:27,770
We're schmoving.

5631
03:20:27,910 --> 03:20:29,350
I'm with Tempo, so like...

5632
03:20:29,350 --> 03:20:30,910
If I die, he dies too.

5633
03:20:31,950 --> 03:20:33,150
That's probably for the best.

5634
03:20:33,690 --> 03:20:34,550
For yourself.

5635
03:20:34,790 --> 03:20:35,790
It's everyone for themselves.

5636
03:20:36,870 --> 03:20:39,250
You think you would live longer as a rat?

5637
03:20:39,550 --> 03:20:40,030
Yeah.

5638
03:20:40,370 --> 03:20:42,450
You know we should do that!

5639
03:20:42,770 --> 03:20:47,890
Tempo now would fuck off the different direction and you fuck off to the right and see who lives longer.

5640
03:20:48,890 --> 03:20:50,950
I'm just hurting rats right now.

5641
03:20:51,250 --> 03:20:53,990
I want that.

5642
03:20:53,990 --> 03:20:55,990
We'll get this ring console.

5643
03:20:56,610 --> 03:20:57,730
We'll grab the Evo.

5644
03:20:58,690 --> 03:20:59,830
We'll have a great time.

5645
03:21:00,030 --> 03:21:01,010
I like this.

5646
03:21:01,690 --> 03:21:02,170
Nice.

5647
03:21:04,710 --> 03:21:05,190
Ideas.

5648
03:21:05,330 --> 03:21:06,950
Alright, Tempo.

5649
03:21:06,950 --> 03:21:07,910
Scan, scan, scan.

5650
03:21:11,570 --> 03:21:12,490
Scan, scan, scan.

5651
03:21:17,690 --> 03:21:20,050
Oh, if we get top thermal with charge rifle?

5652
03:21:20,450 --> 03:21:21,190
Yup, yup.

5653
03:21:21,950 --> 03:21:24,150
If top thermal is open, that's where we're going.

5654
03:21:24,890 --> 03:21:27,270
We grab this Evo Do you think it's open?

5655
03:21:28,410 --> 03:21:29,870
Fuck no, but it might be.

5656
03:21:32,210 --> 03:21:37,610
My expectations of being open are zero, but if it is Tempo, we're going.

5657
03:21:37,790 --> 03:21:38,910
That's very confident.

5658
03:21:39,330 --> 03:21:40,890
How are you guys on purple?

5659
03:21:41,130 --> 03:21:42,230
Because we did our stuff.

5660
03:21:42,330 --> 03:21:43,250
We did our job.

5661
03:21:44,910 --> 03:21:45,930
I'm 20 off.

5662
03:21:46,030 --> 03:21:46,770
How did this happen?

5663
03:21:46,870 --> 03:21:48,970
Because I did damage to people.

5664
03:21:49,390 --> 03:21:52,270
Well, I didn't do damage, but I did my job.

5665
03:21:52,810 --> 03:21:53,290
Just kidding.

5666
03:21:54,150 --> 03:21:55,590
Do I get big drill or drill singer?

5667
03:21:56,410 --> 03:21:57,130
Drill singer.

5668
03:21:57,430 --> 03:21:57,910
Okay.

5669
03:22:00,030 --> 03:22:01,910
The gain of riot drill charge.

5670
03:22:02,570 --> 03:22:03,930
Okay, I think we just play here.

5671
03:22:04,010 --> 03:22:05,330
Can you fence that choke up, Tempo?

5672
03:22:05,670 --> 03:22:07,310
And just pay attention to it.

5673
03:22:08,350 --> 03:22:08,830
Fencing?

5674
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:12,610
Yeah, put fences on the far side too.

5675
03:22:14,950 --> 03:22:15,910
Show presence.

5676
03:22:16,250 --> 03:22:18,750
And then we play up here.

5677
03:22:19,290 --> 03:22:19,530
Okay.

5678
03:22:19,690 --> 03:22:20,710
Are people in there?

5679
03:22:21,270 --> 03:22:21,990
Yeah, they are.

5680
03:22:22,170 --> 03:22:22,710
I see them.

5681
03:22:24,790 --> 03:22:25,190
Okay.

5682
03:22:27,130 --> 03:22:28,930
I'm heading over to...

5683
03:22:30,670 --> 03:22:32,130
Which way do you want me to look at?

5684
03:22:33,490 --> 03:22:35,670
You can look down there for kills.

5685
03:22:36,410 --> 03:22:36,910
Where's there?

5686
03:22:36,910 --> 03:22:37,850
You can look towards thermal.

5687
03:22:38,230 --> 03:22:38,630
Thermal?

5688
03:22:38,690 --> 03:22:38,890
Okay.

5689
03:22:38,930 --> 03:22:40,930
Should I just gen up that building or no?

5690
03:22:41,350 --> 03:22:41,890
No, no.

5691
03:22:41,950 --> 03:22:42,570
We're not playing the building.

5692
03:22:42,710 --> 03:22:43,350
Look at the map, bro.

5693
03:22:43,950 --> 03:22:44,870
Come over here.

5694
03:22:46,250 --> 03:22:47,870
We're not with you, Tempo.

5695
03:22:48,350 --> 03:22:49,190
There's a cat there.

5696
03:22:49,250 --> 03:22:49,750
Can I shoot them?

5697
03:22:50,490 --> 03:22:51,130
Yeah, shoot.

5698
03:22:51,990 --> 03:22:53,270
There's a team entry right now.

5699
03:22:54,390 --> 03:22:54,710
Okay.

5700
03:22:54,830 --> 03:22:57,210
Tempo, come to me and put Gen over here, Tempo.

5701
03:22:57,850 --> 03:22:59,110
This team's going this way.

5702
03:22:59,150 --> 03:22:59,570
They're trying to wrap.

5703
03:23:01,130 --> 03:23:01,450
Whoa!

5704
03:23:01,790 --> 03:23:02,910
He has a longbow.

5705
03:23:03,050 --> 03:23:03,450
What are you doing?

5706
03:23:03,470 --> 03:23:05,090
That's not in the required guns.

5707
03:23:06,390 --> 03:23:07,890
I think this corner's best, right?

5708
03:23:08,350 --> 03:23:09,670
This team's trying to walk up.

5709
03:23:11,170 --> 03:23:12,150
You want us to come to you?

5710
03:23:12,850 --> 03:23:13,290
Yeah, yeah.

5711
03:23:13,350 --> 03:23:14,150
We're gonna have to hold this team.

5712
03:23:14,330 --> 03:23:14,630
Okay.

5713
03:23:14,790 --> 03:23:15,830
I'm heading over to the map.

5714
03:23:15,950 --> 03:23:17,950
Just play where you're at, but look towards true.

5715
03:23:18,030 --> 03:23:19,470
You have to make sure they don't walk up over here.

5716
03:23:19,710 --> 03:23:21,110
You gonna play where you are or where I'm at?

5717
03:23:22,850 --> 03:23:23,610
Kinda towards me.

5718
03:23:24,150 --> 03:23:25,430
Okay, I'm heading to your direction then.

5719
03:23:25,550 --> 03:23:26,370
They're going under me.

5720
03:23:28,530 --> 03:23:29,570
I killed one, I killed one.

5721
03:23:30,190 --> 03:23:30,890
I'm here with you.

5722
03:23:31,510 --> 03:23:32,030
I'm not.

5723
03:23:32,130 --> 03:23:32,950
I'm gonna stay here.

5724
03:23:33,170 --> 03:23:34,010
Yeah, they're underneath me.

5725
03:23:34,050 --> 03:23:37,270
I don't know if they have golden hawk.

5726
03:23:37,390 --> 03:23:38,050
I think that they already have.

5727
03:23:38,410 --> 03:23:39,790
Yeah, I don't think we should drop down.

5728
03:23:40,430 --> 03:23:40,950
No, no.

5729
03:23:43,690 --> 03:23:44,010
Tempo?

5730
03:23:44,930 --> 03:23:45,570
We're good, we're good.

5731
03:23:46,710 --> 03:23:49,350
So we're playing this hill spot.

5732
03:23:49,550 --> 03:23:52,790
Our next spot, we're gonna play for the jungle gyms down on the lower ground.

5733
03:23:52,790 --> 03:23:53,870
Can you guys stay up here?

5734
03:23:53,950 --> 03:23:54,530
Just keep an eye out.

5735
03:23:54,570 --> 03:23:55,790
I'm just making sure our backs are clear.

5736
03:24:00,960 --> 03:24:02,200
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5737
03:24:04,620 --> 03:24:05,160
Whoa, whoa.

5738
03:24:05,560 --> 03:24:07,240
Wait, there's people here!

5739
03:24:07,980 --> 03:24:08,300
Where?

5740
03:24:08,740 --> 03:24:09,160
In tree?

5741
03:24:09,320 --> 03:24:09,960
Or under you?

5742
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:11,960
Okay, we can't let them walk up.

5743
03:24:12,280 --> 03:24:13,780
Oh, they're nading me, they're nading me.

5744
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:15,780
Yeah, they're gonna try to...

5745
03:24:15,780 --> 03:24:16,620
Oh, shit!

5746
03:24:16,740 --> 03:24:16,960
Okay.

5747
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:18,620
Swap about, you're good.

5748
03:24:18,740 --> 03:24:19,420
I'm watching this side.

5749
03:24:20,660 --> 03:24:21,840
I think they went under.

5750
03:24:22,700 --> 03:24:24,520
Yeah, I think that was the tunnel team just trying to nade you.

5751
03:24:24,940 --> 03:24:25,560
Yeah, I think that was the tunnel team just trying to nade you.

5752
03:24:25,980 --> 03:24:26,960
No, no, they were far.

5753
03:24:27,280 --> 03:24:28,020
They weren't in tunnel.

5754
03:24:28,140 --> 03:24:29,360
They ran from a different direction.

5755
03:24:29,820 --> 03:24:31,080
They came from here.

5756
03:24:37,440 --> 03:24:38,240
Let's see...

5757
03:24:45,220 --> 03:24:46,380
I'm heading back to you.

5758
03:24:46,600 --> 03:24:47,620
Our backs are cleared!

5759
03:24:49,420 --> 03:24:50,220
Okay, Tempo.

5760
03:24:50,300 --> 03:24:51,520
Can someone still come up?

5761
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:52,300
Yeah, they can.

5762
03:24:52,900 --> 03:24:54,560
Tempo, come here and just watch our back.

5763
03:24:55,260 --> 03:24:56,300
Just watch it from here.

5764
03:24:56,620 --> 03:24:58,120
Like this.

5765
03:24:58,360 --> 03:25:00,800
Play by this rock and just stare into the zone.

5766
03:25:01,140 --> 03:25:02,960
I need to go see how much space we have.

5767
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:06,620
Where do we go after this?

5768
03:25:08,060 --> 03:25:09,760
I want to see if we can play here.

5769
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:11,720
I think we can play there and just shoot down.

5770
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:13,200
Should we take it early now?

5771
03:25:14,140 --> 03:25:15,560
No, I'm trying to figure that out.

5772
03:25:15,720 --> 03:25:16,500
I think there's a team here.

5773
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:17,520
We can play here.

5774
03:25:17,640 --> 03:25:20,000
We can play all this shit, I think.

5775
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:24,260
We need to make sure that the Tracks team, the team that's under, doesn't come our way.

5776
03:25:26,820 --> 03:25:29,900
So we have to push them into the buildings and then make a big fight happen here.

5777
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:31,180
Tracks team just walked out.

5778
03:25:33,320 --> 03:25:35,080
Let me know when to come.

5779
03:25:35,780 --> 03:25:36,260
They're good.

5780
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:39,940
The Tracks team walked out, so they're playing underneath in Thermal now.

5781
03:25:40,120 --> 03:25:41,520
One of you, Doki, can you look at this?

5782
03:25:41,840 --> 03:25:42,680
Yeah, I'll look.

5783
03:25:42,780 --> 03:25:43,540
I'll go back then.

5784
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:46,120
I'm going to play at our spot right now.

5785
03:25:46,260 --> 03:25:47,180
I think our spot's good.

5786
03:25:48,260 --> 03:25:48,620
Enough.

5787
03:25:50,100 --> 03:25:52,660
There's nobody on the roof.

5788
03:25:52,860 --> 03:25:53,780
They're in their building.

5789
03:25:57,420 --> 03:25:58,560
Oh, he's right here.

5790
03:25:58,680 --> 03:26:00,460
I think he's looking at an ash hall or something.

5791
03:26:02,580 --> 03:26:02,940
Yeah.

5792
03:26:03,520 --> 03:26:04,560
Oh, they're right here.

5793
03:26:05,620 --> 03:26:06,340
Behind the...

5794
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:07,680
Yeah, we just hold them.

5795
03:26:08,440 --> 03:26:09,160
Blue armor?

5796
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:13,440
We need to make them go to the gondolas.

5797
03:26:13,760 --> 03:26:15,340
I don't think anyone's coming on my side.

5798
03:26:15,400 --> 03:26:16,000
We have 10 seconds.

5799
03:26:16,240 --> 03:26:17,080
Someone's evac'ing.

5800
03:26:17,440 --> 03:26:19,500
Position revealed by Ash.

5801
03:26:20,940 --> 03:26:22,580
Yeah, it's the low ground guy that I just killed.

5802
03:26:22,940 --> 03:26:23,520
Oh, okay.

5803
03:26:23,660 --> 03:26:24,240
I was like, what?

5804
03:26:26,220 --> 03:26:27,200
They're going to fly over now.

5805
03:26:27,200 --> 03:26:28,240
Yeah, yeah, flying in on me.

5806
03:26:28,300 --> 03:26:29,180
One, two.

5807
03:26:29,960 --> 03:26:30,600
Come to me.

5808
03:26:30,980 --> 03:26:32,060
Just run off that.

5809
03:26:32,660 --> 03:26:34,480
Just run to me.

5810
03:26:34,780 --> 03:26:35,480
I'm trying to.

5811
03:26:35,800 --> 03:26:36,760
I hit one.

5812
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:38,780
But I might not make it.

5813
03:26:40,340 --> 03:26:41,040
Just get to me.

5814
03:26:41,180 --> 03:26:41,500
Get to me.

5815
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:43,840
Come, come, come.

5816
03:26:46,380 --> 03:26:47,320
I might be dead now.

5817
03:26:47,660 --> 03:26:48,480
They're going to try to send.

5818
03:26:48,580 --> 03:26:49,060
I'm bubbling here.

5819
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:50,000
We're good.

5820
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:51,940
A ball's going to hit our bub.

5821
03:26:52,580 --> 03:26:53,220
Oh, fuck.

5822
03:26:53,500 --> 03:26:53,820
What?

5823
03:26:55,160 --> 03:26:55,780
I can't see.

5824
03:26:55,860 --> 03:26:56,100
I got hit.

5825
03:26:58,260 --> 03:26:59,020
I got one.

5826
03:26:59,020 --> 03:26:59,340
One's dead.

5827
03:26:59,540 --> 03:27:00,260
I got one.

5828
03:27:00,260 --> 03:27:00,680
You have to live.

5829
03:27:01,060 --> 03:27:01,840
I'm dead.

5830
03:27:03,480 --> 03:27:07,420
How did the team on height that was shooting me doesn't just shoot them?

5831
03:27:07,720 --> 03:27:08,940
Why do we get fucked?

5832
03:27:09,180 --> 03:27:11,760
Because we are that unlucky.

5833
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:15,180
Oh, it's Hal.

5834
03:27:17,120 --> 03:27:18,080
Wait, who?

5835
03:27:18,520 --> 03:27:19,780
The one that killed us?

5836
03:27:20,480 --> 03:27:20,960
Yeah.

5837
03:27:21,320 --> 03:27:21,920
Is it?

5838
03:27:22,460 --> 03:27:23,920
No, he's a giggle.

5839
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:25,700
I'm at the high ground.

5840
03:27:27,220 --> 03:27:28,140
I'm at the center.

5841
03:27:28,580 --> 03:27:29,720
Never mind, it isn't.

5842
03:27:30,560 --> 03:27:32,380
The center team is...

5843
03:27:32,380 --> 03:27:33,220
This is madness.

5844
03:27:35,500 --> 03:27:37,180
Did they survive?

5845
03:27:38,500 --> 03:27:39,180
Yeah, they did.

5846
03:27:39,260 --> 03:27:39,640
One dead.

5847
03:27:40,400 --> 03:27:41,540
Oh my god, that's fucked.

5848
03:27:43,560 --> 03:27:44,880
They actually survived.

5849
03:27:45,980 --> 03:27:47,260
Oh, I didn't know they had Maggie.

5850
03:27:47,480 --> 03:27:48,800
Otherwise, I wouldn't have domed there.

5851
03:27:49,360 --> 03:27:50,520
Wait, does the Maggie...

5852
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:52,540
Oh yeah, the Maggie destroys the fucking dome.

5853
03:27:52,760 --> 03:27:55,640
Yeah, I didn't know they had a Maggie.

5854
03:27:56,820 --> 03:27:57,800
Yeah, that's unlucky.

5855
03:27:58,560 --> 03:28:04,120
Okay, as long as I'm higher placed than sure for, that's all that matters to me.

5856
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:05,980
Okay, wait.

5857
03:28:06,500 --> 03:28:08,560
I'm dead right now, so I can check.

5858
03:28:10,320 --> 03:28:13,020
I'm dead right now, so I can check.

5859
03:28:13,540 --> 03:28:14,040
No!

5860
03:28:14,180 --> 03:28:15,220
He's still alive!

5861
03:28:16,860 --> 03:28:17,860
With kills?

5862
03:28:18,560 --> 03:28:19,540
Let me check.

5863
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:20,500
Yes!

5864
03:28:20,500 --> 03:28:21,500
With two kills!

5865
03:28:21,500 --> 03:28:22,860
He's still alive!

5866
03:28:23,880 --> 03:28:24,440
No!

5867
03:28:27,220 --> 03:28:28,840
No, he's gonna...

5868
03:28:28,840 --> 03:28:30,480
He's actually gonna make it.

5869
03:28:33,680 --> 03:28:37,280
Alright, at least we broke one of our goals, which was...

5870
03:28:37,280 --> 03:28:44,600
The other goal that I wanted was to beat our score with Wig, so at least we had that.

5871
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:50,560
It's so Jover.

5872
03:28:51,740 --> 03:28:53,780
Wait, I thought you got a kill with a rampage.

5873
03:28:54,420 --> 03:28:55,640
No, I thirsted a guy.

5874
03:28:55,780 --> 03:28:55,800
He got knocked.

5875
03:28:56,580 --> 03:28:58,800
But then how did our position got revealed by Ash?

5876
03:28:59,660 --> 03:29:00,680
Because the guy...

5877
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:03,260
Like, if you thirst somebody, they can scan the box.

5878
03:29:04,440 --> 03:29:05,600
Oh, you thirsted somebody.

5879
03:29:06,260 --> 03:29:06,660
Oh...

5880
03:29:06,660 --> 03:29:07,520
Thirsting gets you scanned?

5881
03:29:07,640 --> 03:29:08,080
What the fuck?

5882
03:29:08,260 --> 03:29:09,100
Yeah, it's not thirsting.

5883
03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:12,440
I thought it scans the person who you kill.

5884
03:29:14,280 --> 03:29:15,920
Not like the person you thirst.

5885
03:29:15,980 --> 03:29:16,840
That's weird.

5886
03:29:19,260 --> 03:29:21,700
Wait, how did that arc not hit him?

5887
03:29:26,320 --> 03:29:27,340
What's going on?

5888
03:29:31,200 --> 03:29:31,720
Whoa.

5889
03:29:35,610 --> 03:29:36,590
That poor guy.

5890
03:29:36,930 --> 03:29:38,110
Wait, he started crafting?

5891
03:29:38,850 --> 03:29:40,470
What the fuck was he crafting?

5892
03:29:42,270 --> 03:29:42,790
Teammates.

5893
03:29:44,350 --> 03:29:45,990
Yeah, but no, he had teammates.

5894
03:29:52,610 --> 03:29:53,630
Oh my god.

5895
03:29:54,150 --> 03:29:55,050
That was unlucky.

5896
03:29:55,650 --> 03:29:56,650
That they landed on us.

5897
03:30:06,880 --> 03:30:07,860
Team 14?

5898
03:30:08,200 --> 03:30:09,400
No, he's team 15.

5899
03:30:09,680 --> 03:30:10,740
Surefour is team 15.

5900
03:30:13,780 --> 03:30:18,360
Can't believe we didn't find a single triple take either, which is cursed for us.

5901
03:30:18,920 --> 03:30:20,980
I was running double rampage.

5902
03:30:21,180 --> 03:30:25,400
Yeah, we found 200 rampages but like zero triple takes.

5903
03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:31,680
But to be fair, I feel like triple takes have a lower spawn rate in general.

5904
03:30:38,940 --> 03:30:39,940
This is team 15.

5905
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:42,020
Please don't let them have top 10.

5906
03:30:43,360 --> 03:30:43,880
Please.

5907
03:30:44,260 --> 03:30:45,060
There's hope.

5908
03:30:48,580 --> 03:30:49,620
Clearly hope.

5909
03:30:58,060 --> 03:30:59,900
Wait, if they get top 10 are they passed?

5910
03:31:00,120 --> 03:31:02,240
Wait, team 15 got 11.

5911
03:31:02,620 --> 03:31:04,100
But they had two points.

5912
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:07,580
That's two points.

5913
03:31:07,740 --> 03:31:08,740
That's one point.

5914
03:31:08,820 --> 03:31:09,620
So they got three.

5915
03:31:10,740 --> 03:31:11,500
They got three?

5916
03:31:12,120 --> 03:31:12,520
Yeah.

5917
03:31:12,720 --> 03:31:13,760
How many points did they have?

5918
03:31:14,320 --> 03:31:16,140
Unless they used the gun to get that kill.

5919
03:31:16,940 --> 03:31:18,160
How many points is that?

5920
03:31:19,520 --> 03:31:21,320
Like what points were they for 20th?

5921
03:31:22,360 --> 03:31:25,340
That gets them to eight, I think.

5922
03:31:25,440 --> 03:31:26,600
Yeah, that gets them to eight.

5923
03:31:27,060 --> 03:31:28,480
And then how many points did we have?

5924
03:31:29,180 --> 03:31:29,580
Twelve.

5925
03:31:30,040 --> 03:31:30,440
Twelve?

5926
03:31:30,780 --> 03:31:31,180
Thirteen.

5927
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:32,320
Oh, please, please.

5928
03:31:33,100 --> 03:31:34,640
With the plus two that we just got?

5929
03:31:35,280 --> 03:31:35,680
Fourteen.

5930
03:31:36,020 --> 03:31:36,880
Or plus one.

5931
03:31:36,960 --> 03:31:37,700
Sorry, plus one.

5932
03:31:37,740 --> 03:31:39,000
Yeah, plus two that we just got.

5933
03:31:39,080 --> 03:31:39,440
Okay.

5934
03:31:40,020 --> 03:31:40,700
Oh, please.

5935
03:31:41,500 --> 03:31:43,740
Plus three, but you didn't land with him.

5936
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:46,560
I literally was at to get the jump master away.

5937
03:31:48,880 --> 03:31:51,000
And then you pressed jump.

5938
03:31:51,880 --> 03:31:52,400
Instantly.

5939
03:31:52,440 --> 03:31:53,600
I couldn't detach.

5940
03:31:55,260 --> 03:31:55,780
Detach.

5941
03:31:56,220 --> 03:32:00,980
You literally jumped instantly the moment I gave you jump leader.

5942
03:32:01,240 --> 03:32:05,100
I was trying to fucking separate myself from you guys.

5943
03:32:05,660 --> 03:32:08,620
Oh, I thought Matt gave it to me so that I could fly away.

5944
03:32:08,900 --> 03:32:10,880
No, I was jump leader.

5945
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:18,760
Oh.

5946
03:32:18,900 --> 03:32:19,200
Oh.

5947
03:32:19,500 --> 03:32:20,000
Top thermal.

5948
03:32:27,520 --> 03:32:28,700
Oh my god.

5949
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:47,240
Alright, next time I'm gonna be like, please never make me a captain ever again.

5950
03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:48,600
Alright.

5951
03:32:50,900 --> 03:32:54,840
It would've been nice to be told that I got captain.

5952
03:32:55,020 --> 03:32:56,480
It really would've been.

5953
03:32:58,320 --> 03:33:01,380
I could've been like, no, I wanna be a player.

5954
03:33:01,560 --> 03:33:04,740
I'd rather be like chosen instead of a captain.

5955
03:33:09,210 --> 03:33:10,750
No chat, you don't understand.

5956
03:33:11,130 --> 03:33:12,450
I got in last minute.

5957
03:33:13,070 --> 03:33:15,390
Like, when they- Wait, did you actually get in last minute?

5958
03:33:15,450 --> 03:33:17,410
Yes, you were in there before I was in it.

5959
03:33:17,830 --> 03:33:19,130
I was looking at it.

5960
03:33:19,250 --> 03:33:22,310
I literally got in when 50 players were already confirmed.

5961
03:33:23,930 --> 03:33:26,090
That's why I was like, how the fuck was I captain?

5962
03:33:27,690 --> 03:33:29,110
That's why I was so confused.

5963
03:33:32,010 --> 03:33:34,250
No, they never make me captain for Apex.

5964
03:33:34,910 --> 03:33:35,650
They never.

5965
03:33:35,750 --> 03:33:37,510
But they also didn't even tell me.

5966
03:33:40,770 --> 03:33:43,070
I would've been like, I don't wanna be captain.

5967
03:33:44,450 --> 03:33:54,810
Because the thing is, chat, it's not fair because some of the captains are like considered pool A players, but I'm not pool A.

5968
03:33:54,930 --> 03:33:55,850
I'm like pool B.

5969
03:33:56,370 --> 03:33:57,850
Which is where Tempo is in.

5970
03:33:57,990 --> 03:33:58,190
What do you mean?

5971
03:33:58,190 --> 03:34:00,650
Pool B was the pro player.

5972
03:34:00,870 --> 03:34:04,910
Oh, so you wanna be in pool B so that you can't be in the same team as Tempo again.

5973
03:34:05,210 --> 03:34:06,250
That's fucked up.

5974
03:34:06,630 --> 03:34:10,610
No, it's more so don't invite Doki to anymore Twitch Rivals.

5975
03:34:10,610 --> 03:34:15,210
Teams are like super imbalanced because Twitch Rivals will not listen to you, they listen to me.

5976
03:34:16,570 --> 03:34:18,830
Don't invite Doki anymore, alright.

5977
03:34:19,610 --> 03:34:21,530
It's real serious, the real serious voice.

5978
03:34:21,530 --> 03:34:22,030
Well guess what?

5979
03:34:22,410 --> 03:34:23,310
Joke's on you.

5980
03:34:23,710 --> 03:34:24,470
Joke's on you.

5981
03:34:24,510 --> 03:34:26,650
I applied to work at Twitch too.

5982
03:34:26,790 --> 03:34:28,730
You applied to work at leaving TSM?

5983
03:34:29,270 --> 03:34:30,870
No, I was planning to do both.

5984
03:34:31,150 --> 03:34:38,130
Haven't you heard those people who like do 4 4 remote jobs at the same time?

5985
03:34:38,250 --> 03:34:38,850
That's my plan.

5986
03:34:39,390 --> 03:34:45,710
Yeah, but if you work at Twitch the Twitch staff I work with has seniority over you.

5987
03:34:45,910 --> 03:34:48,350
So it doesn't matter what you want.

5988
03:34:48,830 --> 03:34:56,090
I applied for Twitch, I applied for EA and my plan is to work for EA, Twitch and TSM and Falcons all at the same time.

5989
03:34:56,230 --> 03:34:57,450
Bro, you're fucking gonna...

5990
03:34:58,090 --> 03:34:59,830
Is that why you're living with Hal?

5991
03:35:00,010 --> 03:35:00,730
Yeah, is that why?

5992
03:35:02,970 --> 03:35:05,690
Does that why you slid into Hal's DMs?

5993
03:35:05,770 --> 03:35:07,130
And now I live with him?

5994
03:35:07,290 --> 03:35:08,750
And now you're his live-in maid?

5995
03:35:10,150 --> 03:35:10,730
Uh oh.

5996
03:35:16,250 --> 03:35:17,290
Is this why?

5997
03:35:17,430 --> 03:35:18,610
Is this like the trade-off?

5998
03:35:18,650 --> 03:35:20,590
You're his live-in maid and he gets you into Falcon?

5999
03:35:21,050 --> 03:35:22,330
You don't even get paid?

6000
03:35:22,470 --> 03:35:22,850
You just...

6001
03:35:23,450 --> 03:35:24,950
You want the oil money?

6002
03:35:25,290 --> 03:35:25,890
Alright, come on.

6003
03:35:26,090 --> 03:35:26,710
Come on.

6004
03:35:26,730 --> 03:35:27,570
Points, points.

6005
03:35:27,690 --> 03:35:29,450
You're into that oil money.

6006
03:35:34,990 --> 03:35:36,850
You got three points, apparently.

6007
03:35:37,170 --> 03:35:38,530
The Sureforce team.

6008
03:35:38,770 --> 03:35:40,970
I just need to know Sureforce points.

6009
03:35:41,090 --> 03:35:42,090
That's all I want.

6010
03:35:42,630 --> 03:35:43,890
But GG's, guys.

6011
03:35:45,190 --> 03:35:45,830
GG's.

6012
03:35:45,910 --> 03:35:48,630
What a journey today that we had.

6013
03:35:51,610 --> 03:35:55,890
What a fucking journey.

6014
03:35:56,770 --> 03:35:58,370
Woo, that was fun.

6015
03:35:59,370 --> 03:36:00,010
GG's.

6016
03:36:00,050 --> 03:36:00,210
GG's, guys.

6017
03:36:00,410 --> 03:36:00,610
Yeah.

6018
03:36:01,290 --> 03:36:02,290
We'll do it again.

6019
03:36:04,210 --> 03:36:05,810
Challenger circuit year five, right?

6020
03:36:05,850 --> 03:36:06,130
Doki?

6021
03:36:06,310 --> 03:36:09,850
Okay, Wig just has to be able to... Wig is so fucking busy.

6022
03:36:10,050 --> 03:36:10,410
I don't...

6023
03:36:15,830 --> 03:36:18,450
All I'm seeing is that...

6024
03:36:19,790 --> 03:36:22,130
Let's move this over here.

6025
03:36:24,390 --> 03:36:25,910
This over here.

6026
03:36:39,060 --> 03:36:40,200
Alright, what are the points?

6027
03:36:51,180 --> 03:36:53,240
Those are the points so far.

6028
03:36:54,760 --> 03:36:55,560
Without game...

6029
03:36:55,560 --> 03:36:57,180
The thing is, I don't...

6030
03:36:57,180 --> 03:36:57,520
Okay, wait.

6031
03:36:57,620 --> 03:36:59,080
Something got added somewhere.

6032
03:36:59,940 --> 03:37:01,200
Something got added?

6033
03:37:02,400 --> 03:37:03,100
I think...

6034
03:37:03,100 --> 03:37:05,240
I think they already added the points from the hot spots.

6035
03:37:11,250 --> 03:37:12,370
I mean, they better.

6036
03:37:13,630 --> 03:37:14,770
Like, they should.

6037
03:37:15,370 --> 03:37:16,990
But now they just need to add... wait.

6038
03:37:17,190 --> 03:37:19,130
Now they just need to add the points from the games.

6039
03:37:19,710 --> 03:37:22,710
They just need to add points for game six.

6040
03:37:22,970 --> 03:37:24,770
Like, from the actual, like, gameplay.

6041
03:37:24,950 --> 03:37:25,210
Yeah.

6042
03:37:26,230 --> 03:37:28,130
Do we get a point for our placement?

6043
03:37:29,710 --> 03:37:31,170
I got a plus one.

6044
03:37:31,430 --> 03:37:31,910
No?

6045
03:37:32,310 --> 03:37:33,570
What did we place?

6046
03:37:33,790 --> 03:37:34,370
Oh, I have no clue.

6047
03:37:34,550 --> 03:37:36,310
I don't even know what the placement points are.

6048
03:37:45,440 --> 03:37:46,720
What the fuck?

6049
03:37:46,920 --> 03:37:47,540
How the fuck?

6050
03:37:47,680 --> 03:37:48,020
Wait!

6051
03:37:48,660 --> 03:37:51,280
Surefire's team got two minus fives.

6052
03:37:51,780 --> 03:37:52,260
How?

6053
03:37:53,200 --> 03:37:53,680
Wait!

6054
03:37:54,180 --> 03:37:54,660
What?

6055
03:37:56,540 --> 03:37:58,460
Wait, why did they get two minus fives?

6056
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:00,200
How the fuck did you... how the fuck...

6057
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:01,300
Did they mess up twice?

6058
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:04,600
Did you guys get two minus fives?

6059
03:38:10,360 --> 03:38:11,560
Yes, chat!

6060
03:38:11,860 --> 03:38:16,060
He got two... he was... he has minus seven from, like...

6061
03:38:17,180 --> 03:38:21,820
Minus five and minus five in game two and five.

6062
03:38:24,100 --> 03:38:25,860
How the fuck was that possible?

6063
03:38:30,670 --> 03:38:31,730
That's actually impressive.

6064
03:38:33,270 --> 03:38:34,810
That's not actually...

6065
03:38:38,540 --> 03:38:40,200
That's actually very impressive.

6066
03:38:40,540 --> 03:38:41,740
I'm actually...

6067
03:38:41,740 --> 03:38:43,480
Oh, thank god!

6068
03:38:44,380 --> 03:38:44,940
What?

6069
03:38:44,980 --> 03:38:45,500
It's refreshed?

6070
03:38:46,560 --> 03:38:48,220
Wait, I'm trying...

6071
03:38:48,220 --> 03:38:48,460
It's not refreshed?

6072
03:38:49,400 --> 03:38:50,460
Oh my god, please.

6073
03:38:50,800 --> 03:38:51,640
I'm scared.

6074
03:38:52,280 --> 03:38:54,940
Wait, why does this order thingy keep changing?

6075
03:38:55,140 --> 03:38:56,740
It's changing a lot and I'm scared.

6076
03:38:57,460 --> 03:38:58,060
Sorry.

6077
03:39:04,460 --> 03:39:05,520
I don't know.

6078
03:39:05,620 --> 03:39:06,360
I'm scared.

6079
03:39:06,440 --> 03:39:07,140
That's the thing.

6080
03:39:09,460 --> 03:39:10,880
I can't tell.

6081
03:39:11,060 --> 03:39:12,040
I just...

6082
03:39:12,460 --> 03:39:13,560
I just need to know.

6083
03:39:15,340 --> 03:39:17,720
Surely we got, like, fifteenth.

6084
03:39:18,580 --> 03:39:20,200
No, we did not.

6085
03:39:20,540 --> 03:39:23,340
I'm very confident to say that we did not.

6086
03:39:26,180 --> 03:39:26,680
No.

6087
03:39:26,760 --> 03:39:28,540
You know why I really want to be sure for it?

6088
03:39:29,740 --> 03:39:30,500
It's updated.

6089
03:39:30,800 --> 03:39:32,600
Oh wait, it's not updated.

6090
03:39:32,920 --> 03:39:33,360
It's not.

6091
03:39:33,420 --> 03:39:33,900
It's not.

6092
03:39:34,660 --> 03:39:38,400
You know why I really want to get fucking better than sure for it?

6093
03:39:38,460 --> 03:39:43,940
Because he literally messaged me and said you're going to get freaking owned before our tournament started.

6094
03:39:43,940 --> 03:39:44,400
Wait, actually?

6095
03:39:46,420 --> 03:39:47,820
Send him a screenshot.

6096
03:39:49,020 --> 03:39:53,320
He literally was like you're going to get freaking owned before the tournament even started.

6097
03:39:53,340 --> 03:39:53,880
Wait, it's updated?

6098
03:39:54,220 --> 03:39:55,980
It keeps changing.

6099
03:39:57,740 --> 03:40:00,700
He said we picked the wrong characters twice.

6100
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:01,820
Yeah, that's right.

6101
03:40:02,480 --> 03:40:03,820
Every time, yeah.

6102
03:40:03,960 --> 03:40:06,920
Every time you...

6103
03:40:06,920 --> 03:40:08,960
No, I don't know how...

6104
03:40:11,560 --> 03:40:14,660
When your team picked the wrong character.

6105
03:40:19,160 --> 03:40:20,720
Oh my god.

6106
03:40:24,140 --> 03:40:24,660
descriptions

6107
03:40:30,330 --> 03:40:32,790
watching You should pick me over ten points.

6108
03:40:33,970 --> 03:40:34,490
Why?

6109
03:40:34,670 --> 03:40:36,290
You would have got minus ten points again.

6110
03:40:36,390 --> 03:40:38,210
If he wasn't the one...

6111
03:40:38,210 --> 03:40:40,870
He wasn't the one that picked the wrong character.

6112
03:40:42,770 --> 03:40:47,430
overturned See I made sure we were all on the right character beforehand.

6113
03:40:48,390 --> 03:40:49,610
That was my job.

6114
03:40:52,370 --> 03:40:53,290
cookie bar Coryазывa

6115
03:40:59,030 --> 03:41:01,910
Okay, that one's done.

6116
03:41:08,940 --> 03:41:09,960
Alright, we're back.

6117
03:41:12,720 --> 03:41:13,240
Updated?

6118
03:41:13,240 --> 03:41:14,540
Oh, it's updated?

6119
03:41:15,740 --> 03:41:17,200
I think it's perma-updated.

6120
03:41:21,530 --> 03:41:22,910
Man, that's a lot of points.

6121
03:41:30,590 --> 03:41:32,510
I don't think it's updated, man.

6122
03:41:32,670 --> 03:41:35,450
I mean, just add it up yourselves, because they have the...

6123
03:41:35,450 --> 03:41:37,050
I refreshed it.

6124
03:41:37,170 --> 03:41:39,330
No, just add these numbers if they're not accurate.

6125
03:41:43,450 --> 03:41:45,090
You can't be bothered now.

6126
03:41:45,890 --> 03:41:47,370
Yeah, it's too late.

6127
03:41:47,570 --> 03:41:48,490
Too much work.

6128
03:41:48,730 --> 03:41:49,650
What do you mean?

6129
03:41:49,850 --> 03:41:52,550
You were so into the numbers before!

6130
03:41:52,950 --> 03:41:55,350
How did you stop being into numbers?

6131
03:41:55,350 --> 03:41:57,010
My Red Bull ran out.

6132
03:41:57,250 --> 03:41:58,150
You did okay.

6133
03:41:59,370 --> 03:42:01,230
I'm like, no.

6134
03:42:02,350 --> 03:42:03,710
Okay, don't worry, I got this.

6135
03:42:23,860 --> 03:42:24,480
It's alright.

6136
03:42:24,700 --> 03:42:27,460
I'm happy.

6137
03:42:28,400 --> 03:42:32,100
If we did get more than points than Surefour, I'm happy.

6138
03:42:32,240 --> 03:42:32,540
We did.

6139
03:42:32,720 --> 03:42:33,440
I added them.

6140
03:42:33,580 --> 03:42:35,120
Oh thank god, that's fucking karma.

6141
03:42:36,840 --> 03:42:40,360
Now screenshot it and send it to Surefour and say, suck it.

6142
03:42:40,760 --> 03:42:41,820
Wait, how much did we get?

6143
03:42:41,900 --> 03:42:42,320
Where are we?

6144
03:42:42,480 --> 03:42:43,960
We're at 19th.

6145
03:42:44,300 --> 03:42:47,260
But it's higher than Surefour's team, and that's all that's left.

6146
03:42:47,260 --> 03:42:47,840
I got 20th?

6147
03:42:47,860 --> 03:42:48,300
Yeah.

6148
03:42:48,440 --> 03:42:49,700
Fucking slammed.

6149
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:52,380
Fucking slammed.

6150
03:42:55,620 --> 03:42:57,920
Wait, isn't Deeds on their team?

6151
03:43:00,120 --> 03:43:02,420
Isn't Deeds on Surefour's team?

6152
03:43:05,080 --> 03:43:11,100
Guys, I don't think... we can't really celebrate too much about it, because they did get minus 10.

6153
03:43:11,220 --> 03:43:11,500
Guys.

6154
03:43:12,100 --> 03:43:12,580
Oh.

6155
03:43:17,880 --> 03:43:19,200
But like, yeah!

6156
03:43:19,340 --> 03:43:20,160
Fuck you!

6157
03:43:21,560 --> 03:43:23,160
That means we just played smarter.

6158
03:43:24,520 --> 03:43:26,220
We just played smarter, that's right.

6159
03:43:30,060 --> 03:43:34,920
We had a couple of handicaps going in, so like...

6160
03:43:35,940 --> 03:43:38,960
In the end, everyone got the same amount of points.

6161
03:43:39,160 --> 03:43:40,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6162
03:43:41,500 --> 03:43:43,180
From 11th to... what?

6163
03:43:43,300 --> 03:43:44,300
11th to 20th?

6164
03:43:44,380 --> 03:43:45,360
13th to 20th?

6165
03:43:46,520 --> 03:43:47,240
I think?

6166
03:43:47,640 --> 03:43:48,540
Something like that?

6167
03:43:48,900 --> 03:43:49,460
Yeah.

6168
03:43:50,840 --> 03:43:54,960
Why did you message me if they didn't get minus 10, they would've passed us?

6169
03:43:55,160 --> 03:43:57,880
You weren't supposed to read that out loud!

6170
03:43:58,080 --> 03:43:59,840
You weren't supposed to read that out loud!

6171
03:44:00,040 --> 03:44:06,420
I think everybody could easily insinuate that that was what's gonna happen.

6172
03:44:06,700 --> 03:44:08,160
No one needs to know.

6173
03:44:08,160 --> 03:44:09,240
No one needs to know anything.

6174
03:44:09,240 --> 03:44:10,420
Everybody knew already!

6175
03:44:10,600 --> 03:44:11,900
It wasn't a secret!

6176
03:44:12,760 --> 03:44:13,620
Hey, wait a minute.

6177
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:16,020
Timmy's team didn't get minus 5.

6178
03:44:16,200 --> 03:44:18,080
What favor is this?

6179
03:44:18,380 --> 03:44:20,320
Did they actually not get minus 5?

6180
03:44:20,760 --> 03:44:23,780
Unless they got so many points that... Oh, wait.

6181
03:44:23,860 --> 03:44:24,340
Maybe they did.

6182
03:44:24,500 --> 03:44:25,000
I don't know.

6183
03:44:25,100 --> 03:44:25,720
What team are they?

6184
03:44:29,290 --> 03:44:30,170
It doesn't matter.

6185
03:44:30,330 --> 03:44:34,570
In the end, they were not as coordinated as us, because we picked it correctly.

6186
03:44:35,330 --> 03:44:37,670
Like, how do you fuck up twice, you know?

6187
03:44:37,670 --> 03:44:38,910
Tim Tam is Janie.

6188
03:44:39,110 --> 03:44:40,610
All I'm saying is...

6189
03:44:42,030 --> 03:44:43,790
How could they fuck it up twice?

6190
03:44:44,030 --> 03:44:46,570
Like, one time, that's understandable, but two in...

6191
03:44:46,570 --> 03:44:48,050
two times?

6192
03:44:48,050 --> 03:44:48,990
That do be true.

6193
03:44:49,330 --> 03:44:53,970
So with so much intermission in between, that was enough time to pick your legend.

6194
03:44:57,190 --> 03:45:00,210
So, in the end, it's not our fault.

6195
03:45:00,370 --> 03:45:03,150
In the end, it's not our fault.

6196
03:45:04,030 --> 03:45:04,590
We...

6197
03:45:04,590 --> 03:45:05,710
We did it.

6198
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:08,250
We fucking did it, guys.

6199
03:45:09,230 --> 03:45:09,590
GG's, everybody.

6200
03:45:12,570 --> 03:45:12,970
GG's.

6201
03:45:13,190 --> 03:45:13,590
GG's.

6202
03:45:16,150 --> 03:45:17,990
I gotta go play ranked.

6203
03:45:18,690 --> 03:45:19,370
GG's, guys.

6204
03:45:19,390 --> 03:45:20,070
Good luck in ranked.

6205
03:45:20,070 --> 03:45:21,810
I gotta do my second stream.

6206
03:45:22,810 --> 03:45:27,330
We'll see you next Twitch Rivals, and we will increase our position by two.

6207
03:45:27,590 --> 03:45:28,870
Alright, I'm gonna see...

6208
03:45:28,870 --> 03:45:32,130
I'm gonna be in pool B, so we're not gonna see each other.

6209
03:45:32,150 --> 03:45:33,130
You know what the next Twitch Rivals will be?

6210
03:45:33,150 --> 03:45:33,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6211
03:45:33,690 --> 03:45:34,470
I'll be the captain.

6212
03:45:34,510 --> 03:45:35,050
I'll grab you, dude.

6213
03:45:35,270 --> 03:45:36,550
We'll be there in person.

6214
03:45:37,090 --> 03:45:38,150
We'll be there in person.

6215
03:45:39,230 --> 03:45:39,790
We'll be in the same pool.

6216
03:45:40,030 --> 03:45:40,350
It'll be fine.

6217
03:45:40,650 --> 03:45:41,330
Oh, okay.

6218
03:45:41,430 --> 03:45:42,110
So you'll grab me.

6219
03:45:42,430 --> 03:45:43,850
Oh, I see.

6220
03:45:43,970 --> 03:45:45,030
Yo, Mac, you know what?

6221
03:45:45,070 --> 03:45:45,710
You know what this is?

6222
03:45:45,810 --> 03:45:51,830
You know those league games where someone... where your teammate calls you shit, and then you match up against them next match, and then you beat them?

6223
03:45:52,030 --> 03:45:52,890
That's right, Doki.

6224
03:45:53,150 --> 03:45:53,730
You ready?

6225
03:45:55,030 --> 03:45:56,830
Yeah, that's right.

6226
03:45:57,250 --> 03:45:57,870
I'm okay.

6227
03:45:58,110 --> 03:46:02,350
If you match listen to the next IGL, I would be very impressed.

6228
03:46:04,990 --> 03:46:07,390
By the way, the next one is probably in person.

6229
03:46:08,090 --> 03:46:09,590
Is it actually at TwitchCon?

6230
03:46:10,950 --> 03:46:15,410
I would assume that the next one is at TwitchCon if they have an Apex one, right?

6231
03:46:16,010 --> 03:46:17,830
Yeah, but are they gonna have an Apex one?

6232
03:46:17,930 --> 03:46:20,370
There's no way they're gonna have one in between now and, what, September?

6233
03:46:20,710 --> 03:46:21,150
I don't know.

6234
03:46:21,210 --> 03:46:21,470
They could.

6235
03:46:23,050 --> 03:46:24,690
There's nothing stopping them.

6236
03:46:25,670 --> 03:46:26,970
And you guys, you know what?

6237
03:46:27,050 --> 03:46:33,270
You should ask your Twitch Rivals person, and then tell them to run another one, so you can get the salty run back.

6238
03:46:33,530 --> 03:46:34,970
The salty run back?

6239
03:46:35,170 --> 03:46:36,670
Yeah, that's what it's called in League.

6240
03:46:37,030 --> 03:46:37,910
The salty run back.

6241
03:46:38,010 --> 03:46:40,150
I thought you're the one that wants the salty run back.

6242
03:46:40,290 --> 03:46:41,290
I don't care either way.

6243
03:46:41,570 --> 03:46:44,350
You're the one that said he's gonna pick you over me.

6244
03:46:44,530 --> 03:46:45,630
I didn't say that.

6245
03:46:45,630 --> 03:46:49,390
Max said he's gonna pick me back with the one that said that.

6246
03:46:49,450 --> 03:46:51,870
He's like, don't worry, I'll get you on my team.

6247
03:46:52,050 --> 03:46:54,450
Yeah, keep this tempo guy in the same pool.

6248
03:46:55,670 --> 03:46:56,630
You didn't...

6249
03:46:56,630 --> 03:46:58,690
You still are not listening to him.

6250
03:47:01,310 --> 03:47:01,790
Wait.

6251
03:47:02,690 --> 03:47:04,070
I have no idea what we're talking about.

6252
03:47:04,130 --> 03:47:04,890
I'm confused now.

6253
03:47:05,930 --> 03:47:06,370
I'm sorry.

6254
03:47:07,030 --> 03:47:07,230
He's fine.

6255
03:47:07,390 --> 03:47:07,690
He's fine.

6256
03:47:07,730 --> 03:47:08,270
I'm confused.

6257
03:47:08,990 --> 03:47:14,430
90% of this is Max trying to tell you something, and you don't know what it is.

6258
03:47:15,010 --> 03:47:15,530
See?

6259
03:47:16,790 --> 03:47:18,330
He doesn't understand the comms.

6260
03:47:18,330 --> 03:47:19,750
He doesn't understand what I'm saying.

6261
03:47:19,950 --> 03:47:21,550
He's just lost.

6262
03:47:21,990 --> 03:47:23,150
He's Jigsaw though.

6263
03:47:23,350 --> 03:47:24,170
He's Jigsaw.

6264
03:47:25,070 --> 03:47:25,630
Yeah.

6265
03:47:25,730 --> 03:47:27,590
Do you wanna play a little game?

6266
03:47:28,650 --> 03:47:29,090
Oh, bro.

6267
03:47:34,810 --> 03:47:35,690
Oh, yeah.

6268
03:47:35,770 --> 03:47:36,670
Chi-chis, guys.

6269
03:47:37,250 --> 03:47:38,790
Alright, I will see you guys next time.

6270
03:47:39,510 --> 03:47:41,230
Yeah, I'll see you on the other team.

6271
03:47:42,110 --> 03:47:42,550
Later.

6272
03:47:43,330 --> 03:47:44,270
Chi-chis, everybody.

6273
03:47:44,490 --> 03:47:45,250
Chi-chis.

6274
03:47:45,730 --> 03:47:46,170
Bye.

6275
03:47:49,630 --> 03:47:50,650
That was fun.

6276
03:47:52,250 --> 03:47:53,410
That was fun.

6277
03:47:53,570 --> 03:47:54,450
I had a great time.

6278
03:47:54,670 --> 03:47:55,330
This was...

6279
03:47:55,330 --> 03:47:59,130
I knew going in, I was like, this is gonna be a Vibes team.

6280
03:48:01,270 --> 03:48:03,690
I was like, you know what?

6281
03:48:03,790 --> 03:48:11,430
I aimed for Vibes over, like, placement because I just wanted to chill and just have fun.

6282
03:48:11,530 --> 03:48:12,990
I didn't wanna try too hard.

6283
03:48:13,110 --> 03:48:14,250
Cause, like, it's always a gamble.

6284
03:48:14,470 --> 03:48:17,030
It's always a gamble cause what if, like, the chemistry don't work?

6285
03:48:17,210 --> 03:48:21,930
And, like, the chemistry doesn't work and, like, I have to deal with awkward...

6286
03:48:21,930 --> 03:48:25,150
Cause the thing is, I knew the stream was gonna be, like, four hours.

6287
03:48:25,630 --> 03:48:27,890
I knew it was gonna be four fucking hours.

6288
03:48:27,990 --> 03:48:29,190
So I was like, I don't really wanna...

6289
03:48:29,190 --> 03:48:34,610
I don't really wanna fucking be in four hours with a team I might not Vibe with.

6290
03:48:34,930 --> 03:48:37,750
And, like, um...

6291
03:48:38,290 --> 03:48:41,730
And I was just like, yeah, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna chill.

6292
03:48:42,050 --> 03:48:48,990
I want people that I know I'll have fun like, just playing with and just Vibing even when we don't do well.

6293
03:48:49,210 --> 03:48:50,890
Cause, like, that's something I like...

6294
03:48:50,890 --> 03:48:52,110
I like to do.

6295
03:48:52,390 --> 03:48:54,530
Cause, like, I don't take it as seriously anymore.

6296
03:48:56,410 --> 03:48:58,670
Cause, like, I don't...

6297
03:48:58,670 --> 03:49:00,450
For me, personally, like...

6298
03:49:00,450 --> 03:49:01,990
Cause I knew I was captain.

6299
03:49:02,270 --> 03:49:05,730
I was captain and, like, the thing that was fucked is I was, like, really mad.

6300
03:49:05,830 --> 03:49:12,830
Like, not mad but, like, annoyed about because, like, I didn't really wanna be captain was because, like, captains are usually, like, other pro players.

6301
03:49:13,310 --> 03:49:23,690
They're usually, like, other pros or, like, other like, Apex... like, actual Apex players that, like, play this game every single day and are, like, high ranked and stuff.

6302
03:49:23,850 --> 03:49:32,650
Cause they're, like, pro... like, female pro players and... that were captains and, like, other... like, it was all, like, Apex players that play this game 24-7 now.

6303
03:49:32,810 --> 03:49:35,450
And, obviously, I don't cause I'm busy with other stuff.

6304
03:49:35,530 --> 03:49:37,150
Like, I have other stuff right now to do.

6305
03:49:37,770 --> 03:49:38,950
I'm more of a variety.

6306
03:49:39,730 --> 03:49:40,130
Um...

6307
03:49:41,070 --> 03:49:42,770
So, I was, like, really, like...

6308
03:49:42,770 --> 03:49:43,690
I felt, like, oh, man.

6309
03:49:43,770 --> 03:49:46,210
My team, no matter what... um...

6310
03:49:46,210 --> 03:49:58,350
No matter what, we're, like, at a huge disadvantage because, like, it's basically, uh... um... it's basically like, you know, I'm not supposed to be a captain, but I am.

6311
03:50:00,610 --> 03:50:04,210
I'm supposed to be in Pool B, not fucking captain spot.

6312
03:50:04,890 --> 03:50:06,850
So, that's why I was, like, uh...

6313
03:50:06,850 --> 03:50:11,250
Alright, I'm just gonna pick people I vibe with cause it was, like, like I said, I was, like, okay, I do what.

6314
03:50:11,530 --> 03:50:15,550
I was, like, oh, I know Zap's really good, but, like, I don't know what his personality is like.

6315
03:50:15,670 --> 03:50:16,910
I've never played with Zap before.

6316
03:50:17,090 --> 03:50:17,990
I know he's on TSM.

6317
03:50:18,510 --> 03:50:20,110
But I've never played with him before.

6318
03:50:20,350 --> 03:50:21,310
But I played with Mac.

6319
03:50:21,630 --> 03:50:26,050
So, I went with Mac cause I was, like, oh, I played with Mac and I know, like, he and I vibe really well.

6320
03:50:26,350 --> 03:50:28,950
And then I was, like, and then there was, like, six other players left.

6321
03:50:29,090 --> 03:50:31,230
And I was, like, I don't know who these six other players are.

6322
03:50:31,310 --> 03:50:36,870
I'm gonna pick Tempo cause I know, like, he's, like, he's just fun to just, like, like, fuck around with.

6323
03:50:37,070 --> 03:50:38,470
Some, like, just banter with.

6324
03:50:38,650 --> 03:50:39,410
So, yeah.

6325
03:50:39,710 --> 03:50:41,010
Cause I looked at the six players.

6326
03:50:41,110 --> 03:50:43,290
I was, like, who are... I don't know who any of these people are.

6327
03:50:51,010 --> 03:50:51,650
Um, yeah.

6328
03:50:51,770 --> 03:50:52,930
Anyway, it was a great time.

6329
03:50:53,070 --> 03:50:53,730
I do have another stream.

6330
03:50:53,810 --> 03:50:54,510
I'm gonna... I'll...

6331
03:50:54,530 --> 03:50:56,530
delay it 30 minutes, the second stream.

6332
03:50:56,810 --> 03:50:58,870
Only because, like, I do need a rest.

6333
03:50:58,990 --> 03:51:06,970
I had no... I just want you guys to know, I had literally zero break time from... since the convention in the morning.

6334
03:51:07,150 --> 03:51:09,990
That's why I was, like, my energy was dying out at the end.

6335
03:51:10,130 --> 03:51:11,570
Because this was my schedule.

6336
03:51:11,710 --> 03:51:33,790
It was, like, 7 AM, uh, panel, like, tech rehearsal, getting to the apartment, uh, tech rehearsal, um, pan, uh, getting, uh, getting, uh, breakfast real quick, uh, uh, panel, straight to the meet and greet, and then I found out at the end of the meet and greet,

6337
03:51:33,890 --> 03:51:35,170
I was late for the draft.

6338
03:51:35,550 --> 03:51:36,590
Because I was captain.

6339
03:51:36,770 --> 03:51:37,950
And I was, like, what the fuck?

6340
03:51:38,010 --> 03:51:43,070
So I got, like, messages pinging me, being, like, oh, you're supposed to... you're supposed to do, like, the draft right now.

6341
03:51:43,130 --> 03:51:43,830
They're all waiting for you.

6342
03:51:43,870 --> 03:51:45,630
And I was, like, WT... I was, like, what the fuck?

6343
03:51:45,710 --> 03:51:46,530
Like, a question mark?

6344
03:51:46,570 --> 03:51:47,990
What do you mean I'm captain?

6345
03:51:48,190 --> 03:51:48,910
Like, I didn't know that.

6346
03:51:49,250 --> 03:51:52,310
Because they're, like, yeah, if you see the draft channel, that means you're captain.

6347
03:51:52,490 --> 03:51:53,930
And I was, like, I don't pay attention to that.

6348
03:51:54,050 --> 03:51:54,510
Like, I don't pay attention to that.

6349
03:51:55,150 --> 03:51:56,450
No one told me anything.

6350
03:51:56,490 --> 03:51:57,590
I don't pay attention to that.

6351
03:51:57,770 --> 03:52:04,430
I usually look at the Twitch Rivals server when, uh, when the stream's about to start.

6352
03:52:04,730 --> 03:52:06,550
Um, so then I do that.

6353
03:52:06,670 --> 03:52:07,690
I do the drafting.

6354
03:52:08,030 --> 03:52:09,570
And then, um...

6355
03:52:10,210 --> 03:52:12,510
And I played one quick...

6356
03:52:12,510 --> 03:52:15,550
I wanted to do one quick Apex match and then chill until the stream.

6357
03:52:15,770 --> 03:52:18,490
And then that Apex match ended up making me champion.

6358
03:52:19,810 --> 03:52:21,930
So I had to play 20 minutes of that.

6359
03:52:21,970 --> 03:52:22,510
Finish it.

6360
03:52:22,570 --> 03:52:23,970
20 minutes of that.

6361
03:52:24,090 --> 03:52:25,270
Even though I was, like, WKing everything.

6362
03:52:25,370 --> 03:52:26,510
Dying non-stop.

6363
03:52:26,730 --> 03:52:27,910
Like, my team kept being alive.

6364
03:52:28,310 --> 03:52:30,750
And then after that, I went to the stream.

6365
03:52:31,090 --> 03:52:35,110
So, like, literally, no breaks in between.

6366
03:52:35,610 --> 03:52:38,150
So I'm gonna take a 30 minute break.

6367
03:52:39,030 --> 03:52:39,930
Until the...

6368
03:52:39,930 --> 03:52:41,670
Until the next stream.

6369
03:52:41,730 --> 03:52:42,530
So I don't...

6370
03:52:42,530 --> 03:52:45,050
So I can rest my brain a little bit.

6371
03:52:45,510 --> 03:52:46,350
Um, but yes.

6372
03:52:46,450 --> 03:52:48,410
I'll pin that in...

6373
03:52:48,410 --> 03:52:51,790
I'll pin that on the YouTube waiting room.

03:52:51,990 --> 03:52:54,510
