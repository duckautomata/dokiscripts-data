00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,860
Hey!

2
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:05,000
I just realized I forgot to set up some stuff.

3
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm already live!

4
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,800
We have to set stuff up?

5
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,920
No, for my end.

6
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,060
I meant my end.

7
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,340
I thought we had to do stuff for the Tribals.

8
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,640
No, no, no.

9
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,080
I mean like I need to have you guys on my screen.

10
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,580
I forgot about that.

11
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,860
There was something I forgot about.

12
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,540
Oh wait.

13
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,100
Why do you do the Discord overlay?

14
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,300
It's like... I use Fugi.

15
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,980
Oh crap.

16
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm just too lazy now.

17
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah, no.

18
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,660
If I wasn't a streamer, I'd be lazy too!

19
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,060
I was like, wait a minute.

20
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,640
I knew something was missing on my screen.

21
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,620
Something very important.

22
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,200
Where the fuck is this guy?

23
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,740
Alright, here you go.

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
Hey, where are you?

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,220
You're not on my screen.

26
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,520
Where is this?

27
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Sorry, very professional chat, I know.

28
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
This is...

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,260
We're starting off very strong here.

30
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,540
Alright, there's you.

31
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,260
You're gonna be far away from me, Tempo.

32
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,280
So, hello everybody.

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,740
I hope Tempo is not too loud.

34
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,000
Hello.

35
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,580
I hope he is not too loud, guys.

36
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,820
Am I not too loud?

37
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I don't know, actually.

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,800
Your mic is like... you're like in a very empty room.

39
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,600
That's what...

40
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,800
Great.

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,880
Your room has... definitely has no soundproofing.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,600
Wait, wait.

43
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,760
My mic has four things.

44
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,760
It has...

45
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah?

46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,860
The Olympic circle thingy.

47
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
What the fuck does that mean?

48
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,160
It has just a circle.

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,200
It has something that looks like a fortune cookie.

50
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,320
Oh, wait.

51
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,540
Do you have a blue yeti?

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,800
Yeah.

53
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,720
Okay, yeah.

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,340
I was gonna say, that sounds like a blue yeti shit right there.

55
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,080
So, what do I do?

56
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,900
Fortune cookie?

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,320
I don't know.

58
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,840
A cookie, a circle, or the Olympic thing.

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,420
Sound people.

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,920
What does... what should he do?

61
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,280
I... okay, you...

62
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,940
Yeah, sound people help me out here.

63
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm not like a sound person.

64
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,940
What the fuck do you... why would I know this?

65
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,440
It seems like...

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,620
No, you're a streamer.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
I thought... I thought you knew.

68
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,080
Yeah, I'm a streamer that outsources to other people on things that I don't know.

69
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,920
Like, sound being one of them.

70
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,660
I'm just here to choose things that look pretty.

71
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,800
That's really all I do.

72
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,860
Like...

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,580
You think I know anything about sound?

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,780
Oh, you want fortune cookie.

75
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,220
Everyone says fortune cookie.

76
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,360
I am on a fortune cookie.

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Why the fuck do you sound like you're in an... do you have any like... like...

78
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,020
I have stuff in my room.

79
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,380
Do you have like any... it feels like your room is like super empty.

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
That's what it sounds like.

81
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,960
I think because my door is open.

82
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,680
Does that make a difference?

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,420
Bro, I don't know.

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,080
Does it actually?

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,700
Does it actually?

86
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah, he sounds like you're... it sounds like you're in the bathroom.

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,620
Someone's like pad your wall.

88
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,660
That's true.

89
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,740
I was gonna say that too.

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,720
I was gonna say like push shit around your room.

91
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,580
Door is closed.

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Does that change anything?

93
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,840
I guess it like improved a little bit.

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,880
It's like a little bit better.

95
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,340
But it's still... it's so weird.

96
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,240
It sounds like... yeah, it sounds like you're literally in a bathroom.

97
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,300
That's really it.

98
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,560
But my room has stuff in it.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,860
Yeah, but you need stuff on your walls.

100
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,100
Oh, there's nothing on the walls.

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,820
Yeah, that's why.

102
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,300
You need stuff on your walls.

103
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:22,840
That's why.

104
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,620
Should I just fill it with all those posters that...

105
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,020
Yeah!

106
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,760
Your fans sent?

107
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

108
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,380
Yeah, I'll send you a list.

109
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,380
Wait!

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,800
Wait, you should!

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,260
Just all the acoustic Doki posters?

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,060
It'll give you better soundproofing.

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,640
You should.

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,180
I'll give you a list of artists to buy from.

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,960
And then...

117
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,140
Okay, Doki artists.

118
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,600
If you have any...

119
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,620
Doki prints sent up on Etsy or anything, let me know and I'll make Tempo buy them with his own money.

120
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,900
He has a TSM money.

121
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Which isn't a lot, but like...

122
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,120
Sorry, I should say that.

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,020
But if you get paid very well, Tempo...

124
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,940
TSM money, which is it?

125
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,180
You get paid very well, Tempo, for what you do.

126
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,180
Oh, no.

127
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't worry.

128
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,040
I was spreading misinformation earlier, guys.

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,840
Don't...

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,880
Don't put this on any eSport reporting news that a VTuber just...

131
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,800
Exposed payroll.

132
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,240
Guys, it was just a joke.

133
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,860
I swear.

134
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,540
I... I am so warmed up.

135
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,920
Now, I can't wait to...

136
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,260
Not hit any of these shots in the actual game.

137
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,740
Is... Is like...

138
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,580
Is like Wig still in the interview?

139
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,100
That's such a long interview.

140
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,980
Where is... Where is Wig?

141
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,220
Oh my god.

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,360
I like how like...

143
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,800
Wig is like... The name of the tournament.

144
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,120
But...

145
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,460
Greek is Cassie.

146
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,520
Wait, Greek is Cassie?

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,160
Isn't he playing?

148
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,640
Yeah.

149
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Yeah.

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,360
Isn't... Wait, isn't he... Is he playing?

151
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,960
Yeah, he's playing.

152
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,660
He's playing.

153
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,740
He's on one of the teams.

154
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,100
Why the fuck did it say Greek?

155
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,460
Oh, it says Geek Lounge.

156
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,720
I thought that said Greek.

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,060
That would be so funny though.

158
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,120
Oh, wait.

159
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Okay.

160
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,360
In interviews.

161
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:21,820
Okay.

162
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,180
Got it.

163
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,340
That would have been so funny though.

164
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,540
If like Greek was the one casting it.

165
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,780
He should have cast it.

166
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,760
He should have casted it.

167
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
He should have... It would have been so funny.

168
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,420
It would have been really funny.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,720
Also, guys.

170
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,540
How is...

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
How was Tempo?

172
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,940
Should I raise him up or should I keep him this volume?

173
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,380
I don't know if Sound Guy is awake right now.

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,300
I'm still in the bathroom, so it's okay.

175
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,840
Yeah.

176
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,400
Tempo sounds good.

177
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm playing from the toilet.

178
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah, he is.

179
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,580
So, we do pretty badly.

180
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,720
To be fair, there's a lot of things against us right now.

181
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,740
Wait.

182
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,600
Where... Where are the... Where are the listed teams?

183
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,840
That's not it.

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,980
That's not it.

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,660
It's in announcements, I think.

186
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,400
Guys, I just want you guys to know.

187
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm going to talk about this again when Wick joins us.

188
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,880
But like, our team technically consists of two Plat players.

189
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
And a Gold player.

190
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,380
Because... Wait, Tempo.

191
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,980
You're Gold, right?

192
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,740
Who's the Gold player?

193
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,460
I'm in Plat.

194
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,160
You're in Plat?

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Oh, three Plat.

196
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,700
Wait, no.

197
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,920
Is Wick in Gold or Plat?

198
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,420
Wick said he was in Plat.

199
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,260
It's three Plat players.

200
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,380
Oh, it's three Plat players.

201
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,780
Okay.

202
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,320
It's okay.

203
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,460
I put two Plats and a Gold for... to increase engagement.

204
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,000
Wick's the Gold, right?

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,100
It looks better when I have a Gold in my title.

206
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,540
Because people are like, whoa, and a Gold player?

207
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,100
Okay, let me go derank myself here.

208
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,640
Yeah, I mean, that would be easy.

209
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Where am I?

210
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,780
Actually, I'm very close to deranking.

211
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay.

212
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,340
Spoiler reviews.

213
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,580
Anyway, so our team technically consists of three Plat players.

214
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,680
And the thing is that...

215
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:09,200
If you guys watched the drafting stage on Wick's stream, I was on the list and it listed me as Plat 4.

216
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,020
Because technically...

217
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,280
Technically, I had Plat 4 as Doki Bird.

218
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,560
So, I was listed as Plat 4.

219
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,000
So, no one... so, like, people were like, who the fuck is this Plat 4 shitter?

220
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeah.

221
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,660
So, I committed the greatest heist of all time.

222
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,700
Convincing staff I was Plat 4.

223
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,000
I did say... No, I did it right.

224
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I was like, ooh, Masters, but I play like a Plat player.

225
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,740
So, that's why... I literally said, okay, the reason why I was in Plat 4 was because they were like, what's your rank?

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,940
And I was like, well, I got Masters in the last... was it five seasons?

227
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,560
But, technically, I play like a Plat player.

228
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,640
And then they're like, okay, give us your, like, tracker thing.

229
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,100
And apparently, the tracker lists your average rank overall.

230
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,620
And my average rank overall on... as Doki is Plat.

231
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,020
I got away with it!

232
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,460
Yeah!

233
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,460
I can't believe it!

234
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,360
I can't... how does she keep getting away with this?

235
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,680
How does she keep doing this?

236
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh my god!

237
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,020
It's so fucking crazy!

238
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,840
Somebody stop her!

239
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320
Change the bat... oh, don't worry, don't worry, guys.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,860
Don't worry.

241
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,060
I'm way ahead of you.

242
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,560
So, I improved!

243
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,240
Don't worry, guys.

244
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,260
I thought of this, too!

245
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,240
I thought of it, as well!

246
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,300
I do... I have one singular Plat badge.

247
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,600
I just need you guys to know that.

248
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,480
All... out of all the badges, I actually have one singular Plat badge.

249
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,140
Okay, here, let me show you guys.

250
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,740
Where's the badges?

251
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,700
Look.

252
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
We're gonna ignore that.

253
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:37,260
Look at that!

254
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,760
My... my one singular Plat badge!

255
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,420
Right here!

256
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,520
We're gonna ignore the other badges, chat.

257
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,700
We're gonna ignore the other ones.

258
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,100
We're gonna look at the ones that matter right now.

259
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,980
Alright?

260
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,960
The ones that matter.

261
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,300
Welcome back.

262
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,660
Hey, welcome back!

263
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Thanks, dude.

264
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,480
So, how was the interview?

265
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,880
It was good.

266
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,100
They said, uh, hope you win.

267
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,140
And I just started laughing.

268
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,400
Oh, because we're totally gonna win, right?

269
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
No, for sure, for sure.

270
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,260
Wait, wait, wait.

271
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,980
What about now?

272
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,440
What do you mean, what about now?

273
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,600
What do you mean?

274
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,660
Does it still sound like I'm in a bad mood?

275
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Oh.

276
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,460
Yes.

277
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,620
Fuck.

278
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,040
You, you, yeah, it definitely does.

279
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,520
A little bit.

280
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,600
Wait, I just realized.

281
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,100
Oh my god.

282
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,660
They, like, locked out some of the badges because they haven't fixed it yet.

283
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,540
Oh no, really?

284
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,340
I just realized that.

285
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,160
Because I was like, wait, I am missing badges.

286
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,460
What the fuck?

287
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,900
My Plat badges, of course.

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,600
That's what I'm saying.

289
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,980
I'm missing, I'm missing my...

290
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,040
Plat badges.

291
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,060
Yeah, yeah, my Plat badges.

292
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,700
Because, like, for some reason on my count, I only have one Plat badge.

293
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,520
But, like, obviously, I'm a multiple Plat player.

294
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,640
I have a lot of Bronze badges because I was really bad at one point.

295
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,700
And then I improved to Plat.

296
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,880
At one point?

297
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,080
Yeah.

298
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,200
Specifically, there's one point where you were bad?

299
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,920
No, no, I literally have, like, six plus Plat, uh, Bronze badges.

300
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,320
Do you actually?

301
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,360
I thought you had a Flagstaff.

302
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,100
I kind of want that.

303
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,880
I do.

304
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm, okay, wait, wait, wait.

305
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,840
How do I go see my badges?

306
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,260
Check out my stream right now.

307
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,240
Check it out.

308
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,900
Check it out.

309
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,960
Don't worry.

310
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,660
I thought of this too.

311
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,720
If people were like, wait, she's not Plat, don't worry.

312
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,060
I am Plat because I put my badges on.

313
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,160
All that matters is you got the badge on account.

314
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,740
Yeah.

315
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,280
We'll be sharing the first usable legend here soon.

316
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,880
Okay, cool.

317
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,440
Alright, nice.

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
I didn't mean to cut you off.

319
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,720
You're streaming on, you're streaming on Twitch.

320
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,640
I was like...

321
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,340
Yeah, of course, it's Twitch Rivals.

322
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,080
Why would I be streaming on Twitch?

323
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't know.

324
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,480
I don't know.

325
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,040
It's literally Twitch Rivals.

326
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,320
Alright, let me put you...

327
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Let me add you on the screen here.

328
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,360
Damn.

329
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,340
You got some nice bronze badges.

330
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,900
Yeah, you like it?

331
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,840
Yeah.

332
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,060
Yeah, you know I improved as a gamer.

333
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,500
Because like, I went from bronze to Plat.

334
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm at my peak.

335
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm at my peak right now.

336
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,940
Yeah.

337
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,080
Yeah.

338
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,700
Codes out!

339
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,280
Codes out!

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Alright, I need to apparently raise up...

341
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,520
It's alright.

342
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,860
I'm not going to be the last person joining in anyway.

343
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,300
It'll be fine.

344
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,560
It's no way.

345
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,380
I can like...

346
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,820
Okay, wait.

347
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,640
Ready?

348
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,540
We have our comp here.

349
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,500
List of legends from map one.

350
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,160
Okay?

351
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,420
Fuse, Mad Maggie, Horizon, Revenant, Bloodhound, Rampart, Watson, or Gibraltar.

352
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
Wait, can you repeat that?

353
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,020
That's a lot of people.

354
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,720
Assault.

355
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,160
Okay?

356
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,880
Assault is going to be Fuse, Mad Maggie.

357
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,540
I can read it.

358
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,200
Skirmisher is going to be Horizon, Revenant.

359
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,680
Recon is going to be Bloodhound.

360
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,680
Controller is going to be Rampart, Watson.

361
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,000
And then the last one is Gibraltar.

362
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,580
Okay, we clearly need like a ring reader.

363
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,220
We need somebody to read the ring and we're going to survive here.

364
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,100
That's what people are probably going to do.

365
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,900
They're probably going to go Horizon, Blood, Watson.

366
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,300
Yeah, you know all the pros are going to take the blood.

367
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,600
Okay.

368
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,840
And run everything down.

369
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,600
Yeah, Wig.

370
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,820
Our captain.

371
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,440
Yeah, you're going to run everything down.

372
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,920
Yeah, right?

373
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,300
Right, Wig?

374
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,260
Hell no.

375
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,740
I'm the player.

376
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm playing live.

377
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,760
What do you mean, Wig?

378
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,640
You really are Captain Pro.

379
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,700
It says, it says Captain Pred Pro.

380
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,860
Are you trying to say you're not professional?

381
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,040
Did you lie on your resume?

382
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,860
You lied on your resume.

383
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,480
Yes, of course.

384
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,060
My LinkedIn was a complete fucking lie.

385
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,140
I shouldn't even be here in the first place.

386
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,800
Fake it till you make it, I guess.

387
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,140
So are you playing Fuse?

388
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,840
No, we need somebody for control.

389
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,300
If Tempo wants to play Fuse, I'll play Bloodhound.

390
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,940
I'll take the L.

391
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,320
Yeah, that's fine.

392
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,280
Okay, that's great.

393
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,660
And then I guess I'll play Watson then.

394
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
So we're playing Watson, Bloodhound, Fuse?

395
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,640
Fuck it, dude.

396
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,140
Lock me in.

397
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,440
I'm so down.

398
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,500
We need somebody to read the ring.

399
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,500
I mean, no, I agree.

400
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,280
Yeah, you're right.

401
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,540
We're starting off on World's Edge, so I play Geyser.

402
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,420
So we're Geyser.

403
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,800
Sorry, that's not the best POI.

404
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,920
You gave us Geyser?

405
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,920
I know, I panicked.

406
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,340
You gave us Geyser?

407
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,560
You're literally the fucking headliner.

408
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,040
You can request for any fucking POI.

409
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,820
I know, I panicked so bad.

410
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,200
And then we have Tempo that can kick off any pro player off the scrims.

411
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,700
I know, I know.

412
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,980
If they try to contest us.

413
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,940
I know, I got scared.

414
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,140
I said abuse your power, not be a bitch.

415
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh, but I'm always a bitch, man.

416
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,380
I'm always a bitch.

417
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:35,860
Bro.

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,400
Oh, I'm always a bitch, man.

419
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,700
What happened to you, man?

420
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,780
What happened?

421
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,580
I've been this way.

422
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,360
What happened?

423
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,500
We had to go back to childhood.

424
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,360
I don't know, dude.

425
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,820
What?

426
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,380
I had this emotional trauma.

427
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,220
Whoa, how long ago?

428
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,500
How long ago did I become a little bitch?

429
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah, become a little fucking bitch.

430
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:54,880
Shit's good.

431
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,860
I mean, Geyser's... realistically, Geyser's not awful.

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,580
It isn't.

433
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,020
No, it's pretty.

434
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,000
No, it's pretty awful.

435
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,320
No, you guys are just coping now.

436
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,780
Does the flying thingy... does the flying thingy...

437
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,780
no, it's pretty awful.

438
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,780
No, you guys are just coping now.

439
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,920
Does the flying thingy still go through Geyser?

440
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,420
What?

441
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:08,920
What?

442
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,720
The... the...

443
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,780
The what thing?

444
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,120
The what thing?

445
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,240
The Evac tower?

446
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,300
The ball thingy.

447
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,540
The Evac?

448
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,660
No, the...

449
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,180
What the fuck is the ball?

450
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,660
What is the ball?

451
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,240
The flying ball.

452
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,200
The drone that flies with the ball.

453
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,900
What?

454
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,380
Why is that...

455
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,620
Why am I forgetting what that...

456
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,220
The drone...

457
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,180
You're talking about the loot tick?

458
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,660
Are you talking the loot balls?

459
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,680
Is that...

460
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh my god.

462
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,760
Guys, I'm so sorry.

463
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,860
Guys, I'm just... not bottom five.

464
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,560
That's my goal.

465
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,980
What do you mean, not bottom five?

466
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,340
Oh my god.

467
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,460
He watches Apex every day and said the loot ball thingy, dude.

468
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,380
Wait, no.

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,820
The loot tick is the...

470
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,080
The cargobot.

471
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,780
Cargobot.

472
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,700
The loot tick is the thing with the legs.

474
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,580
Yeah, cargobot.

475
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,100
Yeah, but he said the ball thingies, you know?

477
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,040
Yeah, it's a ball.

478
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,560
He said it as if it's like something we fucking take, like a fucking...

479
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
The tower.

480
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:05,920
The tower.

481
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh my god.

482
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,320
Okay, the lobby is open.

483
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm heading in.

484
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,940
Guys, we're gonna...

485
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,260
We're gonna...

486
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,580
Not bottom five.

487
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,120
I'm actually not gonna use charge rifle and no one will run at us.

488
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Not bottom five.

489
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,420
Let's go.

490
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,700
Okay.

491
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,080
How good are you with the Sentinel?

492
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,040
Bro.

493
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,080
Can we just run three snipers and just...

494
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,480
Bro.

495
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,520
...go somewhere high and then just try and snipe people and get kills that way?

496
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,140
And just make everyone angry?

497
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,360
Okay.

498
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,740
I'm gonna...

499
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,140
We just...

500
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,440
The way to get to that area is that we have to make sure we don't dive to travel there first.

501
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,480
That's the...

502
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,240
We have to make sure...

503
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,480
No Valk is gonna be our crutch here.

504
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:46,860
We're fucked.

505
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,240
That's gonna hurt us.

506
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,660
We have no Valk.

507
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,060
Yeah.

508
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,680
Remember, we need three evac towers.

509
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,840
Well, last time we played...

510
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,560
Well, actually, no, we didn't play.

511
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,100
But last time, you know...

512
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,720
Last time you and Tempo played.

513
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,300
I played.

514
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,860
Yeah, with me.

515
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,340
I would say that we had Valk because we literally needed it.

516
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,620
Now we don't have it.

517
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,040
But no one else has Valk too.

518
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,860
We're playing without Valk or an evac tower.

519
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,760
Okay.

520
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,720
So at this point, we just gotta hope RNG are...

521
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,220
Wait, wait, wait.

522
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,920
You have connections to Saf, right?

523
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,180
Can they...

524
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,100
Just spawn some evac towers in front of us?

525
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,920
Like rest...

526
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,460
Grig just came to my chat.

527
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,560
Grig just came to my room and said, if Tempo kills me, I'm pulling the fucking ethernet cable.

528
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,660
So Tempo, if you kill him, bro, my internet goes out.

529
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,040
Just know it was worth it.

530
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
Yeah, but his internet goes out too.

531
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
He fucks over his phone.

532
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,120
No, he's just gonna come in mine and pull mine.

533
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,720
But he's gonna pull mine.

534
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,860
But you can go over to his room and pull his as well.

535
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,440
Yeah.

536
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,820
I can't pull out Hal's internet.

537
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,360
Throw his PC.

538
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:43,640
Yeah.

539
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,580
You can pull...

540
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:44,780
Okay.

541
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,060
Tell Hal if he kills us.

542
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,700
I'm in the house alone.

543
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,860
Everyone's...

544
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,940
I can't pull out anyone's internet.

545
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,560
No, you...

546
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,100
Wait.

547
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,100
Oh, wait.

548
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,540
How...

549
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:55,780
Okay.

550
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
Does any TSM member live with you?

551
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,260
They all do, but no one's here.

552
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,020
No, but you can be like...

553
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,680
Just log in on his computer and then it'll just...

554
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:05,720
I'm just gonna...

555
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,500
Disconnect him.

556
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,340
No, no, no.

557
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,820
Threaten their PCs.

558
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,300
I'm gonna install Destroyer 2009 on your PC if you kill me.

559
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,620
Okay.

560
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,300
To be fair, I was gonna say like throw their PCs out, but you can do that.

561
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,880
See?

562
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,140
That's true.

563
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,220
But keep this mad for their PCs.

564
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,760
Threaten their PCs.

565
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,320
You literally have...

566
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,680
They're like babies right now.

567
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,720
That's like the way to go.

568
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,520
Hold on.

569
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,040
Hold on.

570
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,480
Hold their PCs hostage.

571
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,040
Exactly.

572
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,980
Someone in my chat said, hold their PCs hostage for first place.

573
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,840
Oh my God.

574
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,340
We're cooking.

575
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,500
Oh my God.

576
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,080
Someone...

577
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,860
I'm so happy I didn't listen to any of that and just...

578
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,480
I literally come back to we're cooking.

579
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,480
So I just know that was an absolute shit show of words that I shouldn't have heard.

580
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,180
No, we're discussing about how Tempo should hold TSM PCs for hostage.

581
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,560
So it'd be like your PC's gonna get ransomware if you kill us.

582
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,560
Oh.

583
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,000
Holy fuck.

584
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,060
Bro, they're gonna be so scared.

585
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,660
They wouldn't wanna kill us after that.

586
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,780
We're gonna do so well, guys.

587
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,100
Not bottom five.

588
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,960
That's all I would ask for.

589
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,810
Bottom five.

590
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,170
No way it's bottom five.

591
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:34,710
No way.

592
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,110
There's no way.

593
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,690
There's no way.

594
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,910
And if we do get bottom five, the system hated us.

595
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,770
We were too good to play their games.

596
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,690
No, listen, I'm gonna tell you right now.

597
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,310
You guys, listen, I have the right to...

598
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,410
Are you sipping something or laughing?

599
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,610
No, I'm sipping...

600
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,110
He's just laughing at you.

601
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,930
I was like, this is gonna be a serious game.

602
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,030
The Lulu mode.

603
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,950
Listen, I can get us where we need to be.

604
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:04,890
Okay.

605
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,410
Okay, how?

606
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,170
We just...

607
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,270
I don't know yet.

608
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,910
We're gonna figure it out.

609
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,570
Okay, okay.

610
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,470
Okay, I thought you figured it out already.

611
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,910
We don't have a Valk.

612
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,790
A Valk was really easy for me to get us where we need to be.

613
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,590
But, I'm telling you, if we get there, I think Tempo's gonna pop off.

614
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,370
I'm serious here too.

615
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,830
I'm not lying.

616
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,970
Okay, how much you wanna bet?

617
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,990
We don't have to bet anymore.

618
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,050
No, no, no, no, no.

619
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,910
I wanna know what your money is.

620
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,770
Like, how much you wanna bet?

621
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,650
I'll bet you a second blended Subway sandwich.

622
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,350
We didn't do the first one.

623
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,590
I can't trust you on that.

624
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,910
You didn't do it either.

625
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,250
I was waiting for you.

626
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,270
Technically.

627
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,290
Technically, I'm free from that already.

628
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:43,810
Oh, wait.

629
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,310
That's bullshit.

630
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:44,770
No way.

631
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,050
Technically, I'll keep it.

632
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,830
Doki Bird didn't promise a blended Subway.

633
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,730
I'm just saying.

634
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,650
I'll give you five subs that Tempo gets.

635
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,110
Five?

636
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,650
Well, actually, how many kills though?

637
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,270
You know what I mean?

638
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,750
That's how much you believe in him.

639
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,510
Five subs.

640
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,270
That's how much.

641
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,610
His life is worth five subs.

642
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,150
That's like how many dollars.

643
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,250
That's like...

644
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,670
Don't gaslight me.

645
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,010
You're playing on his downfall.

646
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,390
You're saying he's so bad.

647
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,710
No, I wanna know how much you believe in him.

648
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,030
But clearly, you don't believe in him enough if it's worth five subs.

649
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,110
Alright.

650
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,370
Yeah, you couldn't be more right.

651
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,070
I'm 100%.

652
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,430
Yeah.

653
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,190
No offense, Tempo.

654
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,670
I love you to death.

655
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,830
But like, I'm not gonna sit here and say he's gonna get like ten kills.

656
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,290
I think Tempo gets like five in six games.

657
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,150
I can't believe... I can't believe he's...

658
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,750
Like, if he gets a kill, it's gonna be on a pro player.

659
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,130
So you're trying to say that his pro player kills aren't even worth more than that?

660
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,530
I'm trying to say that he's worth more than one sub per kill.

661
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,890
There we go.

662
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,350
It's not even worth one.

663
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,270
Wait, I'm playing... wait, wait, wait, wait.

664
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,470
Only allowed legend is Fusing Mad Maggie Horizon?

665
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,270
Wait, what?

666
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,170
Revenant Bloodhound.

667
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,630
Oh, there they go.

668
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,830
They're going.

669
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,510
Revenant Bloodhound.

670
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:51,630
Oh, there they are.

671
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:51,930
Okay.

672
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,930
Yeah, yeah.

673
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,170
Okay.

674
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,550
Bro, do you mean...

675
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,170
Watch the developer, yeah.

676
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,790
You're trying to say Tempo is worth like $25 in kills?

677
00:24:59,490 --> 00:24:59,930
Correct.

678
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,510
Bro!

679
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,310
Yes.

680
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,270
Question.

681
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,710
If I had to pay Tempo to be on my team for $25, I'd pay him $25.

682
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,310
Oh!

683
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,630
What are the odds someone ends up with negative points today?

684
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,450
Who's Selene?

685
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,270
What?

686
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,790
Wait, say it again?

687
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:18,830
Oh, yeah.

688
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,810
Say that again.

689
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,870
Who the fuck is that guy?

690
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,750
Who the fuck is that?

691
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,750
I don't know who the fuck Selene is.

692
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,350
What a fucking bum.

693
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,870
Yeah, I'm Doki.

694
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,970
Yeah, what are you talking about?

695
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,710
It's my first time meeting Doki.

696
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,210
Yeah.

697
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,350
Yeah.

698
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,430
Okay, five subs.

699
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,910
Okay.

700
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,310
If Tempo does... wait, wait, what was the deal again?

701
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,290
If Tempo gets like a $25, he's gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna get a $25.

702
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,750
That's what I'm saying.

703
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,850
One kill, it's five subs.

704
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

705
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,050
You're making...

706
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,490
Holy shit.

707
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,790
Wait, one kill, five subs?

708
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,730
Shit, no.

709
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,290
No.

710
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,130
Doki made...

711
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,790
I didn't say that.

712
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,350
I can get a hundred subs here.

713
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,850
Yeah.

714
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,390
Okay, okay.

715
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:56,870
If Tempo gets one kill, you have to gift me and Tempo five subs each.

716
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,010
Oh my God, imagine, imagine Destroyer actually gets in his lobby.

717
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,430
Holy crap.

718
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,070
Also, if he doesn't, you have to gift me five subs.

719
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,790
All right, down.

720
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:13,690
I don't know how I always get wrapped in these things with you, but it just matters.

721
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,090
It's fine.

722
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:14,650
Yeah!

723
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,930
We did it!

724
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,830
Of course you did it!

725
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,650
You do it every time!

726
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,530
You're so good at it!

727
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,690
Because you're such a little bitch!

728
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:21,890
What?

729
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,390
That's insane to say!

730
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,070
How am I a little bitch, bro?

731
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,550
I'm a bitch for believing in my friends?

732
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,050
Now you don't agree that you're a little bitch?

733
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,810
You literally told me you've been a little bitch since you were young!

734
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,510
No, how no!

735
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,350
I'm not a little bitch.

736
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,130
You literally told me you've been a little bitch since you were in 6th grade!

737
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,330
Or since you were 6.

738
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,750
And now you're not?

739
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,110
No, no.

740
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,690
Actually, today's the day I change.

741
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,790
I'm not a little bitch anymore.

742
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,990
Today's the day you change.

743
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,970
After giving us Geyser as a drop spot.

744
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,690
Today's the day you change.

745
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,230
Hey, hey!

746
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,750
Listen!

747
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,350
I got command center!

748
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,410
That's pretty fucking good!

749
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,110
For the next map.

750
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,950
I got that too!

751
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,850
Maybe I am still a little bitch.

752
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,670
Holy shit!

753
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,190
Hey, listen.

754
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,290
I'm gonna do this.

755
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,830
Drop Geyser.

756
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,550
Ready?

757
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:15,910
Look at me.

758
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,210
Look at me.

759
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,070
Banned from Torni.

760
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,670
Oh fuck, I spelled Torni wrong.

761
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:23,970
FYI.

762
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,210
Yeah, let him know.

763
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,170
Because Nox is thinking about where free kills are now.

764
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,730
I guarantee it.

765
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,450
And then he's licking his lips.

766
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,950
Just be like, if you kill us, Wake isn't gonna watch part of your team.

767
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,790
They might be thankful for that.

768
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,830
Oh shit, no.

769
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,610
You will watch their team.

770
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,290
You kill us, Wake's gonna watch your team.

771
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,950
No one should drop on us.

772
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,990
I told them they don't get any DC restarts that they do.

773
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,290
Oh my god, you're a genius bro!

774
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:53,670
Nice!

775
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:54,990
You're a genius!

776
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,250
Hold them hostage!

777
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,590
Fuse, tempo fuse.

778
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,090
Hold them hostage!

779
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,550
The only free skin I got.

780
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,250
Who am I going again?

781
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,310
Bloodhound.

782
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,910
And you're going Watson.

783
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,990
Yeah, I'm going Watson.

784
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,770
We didn't get negative five.

785
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,650
So that's good.

786
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,750
If someone goes negative, we have to be mean to them.

787
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,570
We have to be mean to them.

788
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,370
We're doing this show in messages, we have to be mean.

789
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:22,890
Yeah, yeah.

790
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,890
Just spam, who's negative five right now?

791
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,710
Who are we restarting for?

792
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,810
You gotta be mean to them.

793
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,150
We got this.

794
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,390
I can't beat you up, Max.

795
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,590
Okay, wow.

796
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,650
Where am I landing?

797
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,290
Pass it to the little bitch, I guess dude.

798
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,950
Yeah, the little bitch who's captain.

799
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,210
Yeah, yeah.

800
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,370
Little baby.

801
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,310
I'm trying to build up your confidence.

802
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,530
That's why I'm giving you Jump Master.

803
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,150
You just called me a bitch like 40 times.

804
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,010
Yes, but if you cry about it, then you are.

805
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,190
Now you can build it back up.

806
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,710
Yeah, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

807
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,030
You're so right.

808
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,810
Words will never hurt me.

809
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,630
Exactly.

810
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,670
Only in high school.

811
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,290
They really hurt in high school.

812
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,010
Hopefully the zones cost.

813
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,730
We're not getting a contestant, right?

814
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,050
There's no way to contest this.

815
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,050
It's fucking Geyser.

816
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,290
I'm not gonna leave in the game.

817
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,890
It's like, what the fuck do you want Geyser for?

818
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,150
It's literally the shittiest drop ever.

819
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,970
I should've went No Name.

820
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,730
I'm just gonna go through tunnel.

821
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,130
I'll go through tunnel.

822
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,250
We have no beacon.

823
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

824
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,430
We're off to a good start.

825
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,630
We could go to Overlook and get it.

826
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,910
Wait, there's Gents killing more.

827
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,750
Oh, it's not fucking anonymous mode.

828
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,170
Yeah, it's not anonymous mode.

829
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:35,730
It's okay.

830
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,370
Don't restart it.

831
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:36,950
We're fine.

832
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,610
That's one less team.

833
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,070
Don't worry about it.

834
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,590
True, actually.

835
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,850
I'll tell them to put it on for the next game.

836
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,450
Alright.

837
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,030
They didn't have it on during, what's it called, either?

838
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,870
The Asia Festival, right?

839
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,590
Uh...

840
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,990
I don't remember.

841
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,670
I don't think it's common to have it on.

842
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,350
Yeah.

843
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,670
For Asia, isn't it?

844
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,790
I think you're right.

845
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,490
It's been a while since I played Asia tournaments.

846
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:02,830
It's been a while since I played Asia tournaments.

847
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,430
We can grab two charge rifles, Vig.

848
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,790
You already have one?

849
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,110
Do not listen to the dark comments in your mind.

850
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,510
No, that's low-key low-key.

851
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,330
It should be the most annoying team in the game.

852
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,610
Do not listen.

853
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,810
I don't have a backpack, bro.

854
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,370
Okay, we're off to a really, really good start.

855
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,550
Bad start.

856
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,810
No, no, no.

857
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,570
It means you're gonna get purple backpack later on in life.

858
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,030
It means you're gonna get purple backpack later on in life.

859
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,370
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,050
Next game.

861
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,270
Next game you'll get a...

862
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,870
Okay, here's this.

863
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,490
We'll take this.

864
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,570
Okay, guys.

865
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,110
Thank God we don't have to...

866
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,210
There's no armors left on the floor because...

867
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,230
I don't think we were ever gonna find armors in Geysi.

868
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,850
No, we were probably gonna get just triple white anyway.

869
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,450
Yeah.

870
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,210
There's no difference now.

871
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,790
Geysi was like...

872
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,650
Yeah, Geysi was pretty bad.

873
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,790
It's not like awful.

874
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,210
No, it's fucking awful.

875
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,790
What do you mean?

876
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,110
The little drone is flying by.

877
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,830
It's okay.

878
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,730
Yeah, you can shoot the drone.

879
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,190
Do we have a Valkyrie?

880
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:02,790
Yeah.

881
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,150
No.

882
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,770
Why would you think we have...

883
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,930
The little drone did not come this way.

884
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,390
Who didn't ping it three times?

885
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:10,830
Tempo.

886
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,150
It's really cute that you think we'll have anything.

887
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,950
Okay, wait.

888
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,550
Where do we go?

889
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,470
I'm trying to think.

890
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,410
We gotta craft up.

891
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,270
Craft a bat real quick.

892
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:21,650
I have nothing.

893
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,990
I'm gonna craft... I did.

894
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,790
I'm gonna craft a bat right now.

895
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,750
We have four bats.

896
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,190
I'll craft a bat for you.

897
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:27,690
Okay.

898
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,430
I'm gonna hit this raven and just see where people are going.

899
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,250
So we're not getting routed.

900
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,290
Wait, they might be routing that tunnel.

901
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:32,950
I think I saw someone.

902
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,250
One second.

903
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,090
Okay, because I'm crafting this.

904
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,030
If I get shot, I will craft it.

905
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,630
No, we're good.

906
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:37,870
We're good.

907
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:37,970
We're good.

908
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,110
We're good.

909
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,790
I still need a backpack.

910
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,470
It's crazy.

911
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,430
Here.

912
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,630
Here's a bat.

913
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,030
I'm pretty sure I saw a white backpack.

914
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,210
Maybe.

915
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,110
Maybe.

916
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,270
Alright, we should try to rotate it where a beacon is.

917
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,150
Where is beacon?

918
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,470
Well, big mod's probably still over there.

919
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,450
So I don't know if I want to go that way.

920
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,310
Oh, thank you.

921
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,290
Siphon's pretty shit.

922
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,250
I mean, we could just rotate it.

923
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,130
There might be multiple squads rotating in that way.

924
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,730
There's no siphon sign.

925
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,670
Let's just start walking up.

926
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,210
Alright, I believe in you.

927
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,010
I don't have any e-box hours.

928
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,250
Anyone?

929
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,250
Nope.

930
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,610
We are in an awful spot for our rotations.

931
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,330
There's a pack right there.

932
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,530
I don't know if...

933
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,130
Alright, who's gonna get it?

934
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,330
Look at all of us.

935
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,590
Let's start moving up.

936
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,790
Alright.

937
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,230
We're very not so good right now.

938
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,510
I'm gonna go get it.

939
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,770
I'm gonna cover you.

940
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,010
I'm watching with the charge rifle.

941
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,650
I am shooting fences behind us.

942
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,770
Okay, I'm dead guys.

943
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,650
That's fine.

944
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,090
I'm so fucked.

945
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,330
The one in blue armor, that's okay.

946
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,050
We're so fine.

947
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,710
They're dropping down guys.

948
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,510
They're dropping down.

949
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,210
They're heading to...

950
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,270
I'm in that area.

951
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,490
I forgot what that is.

952
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,350
I got an R301.

953
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,610
Suck it bitch!

954
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,390
Yeah, fuck them up.

955
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:56,950
Tempo.

956
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,870
Tempo, go Tempo, go.

957
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,510
I'm reloading.

958
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,550
Are they moving through?

959
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,350
They already crossed over that.

960
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,070
Are they in the building?

961
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,070
I don't know.

962
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,870
They ran back into siphon.

963
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,630
I'm gonna come up and scan.

964
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,990
We should try to get one of these buildings and move in.

965
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,810
I'm gonna scan one sec.

966
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,630
We're right behind you.

967
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,230
I'm gonna come up.

968
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,330
Nice job Tempo.

969
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,490
Oh my god, Tempo's doing it.

970
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,990
I have 12 nades.

971
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,870
If we can just trap someone somewhere, I can just...

972
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,490
If we can just trap someone...

973
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,270
Let shit loose.

974
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,390
I mean, I have a gold R301.

975
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:33,990
Realistically.

976
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,770
No matter how bad I am.

977
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,630
13 nade.

978
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,810
We wanna keep moving in a little bit though, cause I don't see anyone posted up here at all.

979
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,150
We wanna keep moving?

980
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,850
We're gonna keep moving.

981
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,210
I'm just gonna keep scanning so we can get routed on.

982
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,970
We're gonna keep moving.

983
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:45,970
I'm just gonna keep scanning so we can get routed on.

984
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,910
I'm right behind you.

985
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,910
Guys!

986
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,030
We're not 20th!

987
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,690
No, that's huge for us.

988
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,510
We're not 20th!

989
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,650
We're making waves!

990
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,450
It was Keon!

991
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,730
It was fucking Keon there.

992
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:55,330
Did no one nade Syphon?

993
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,890
No, no, no.

994
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,130
There was.

995
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,390
There was.

996
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:58,550
There was.

997
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,190
I think Halcon.

998
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,050
Oh my god.

999
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,410
I don't think this whole side's looted though.

1000
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,190
That makes me definitely think it's towards the...

1001
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,650
Definitely this is not... this is not Zoom.

1002
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,550
I have 12... I have 20 shield cells.

1003
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,130
Alright, we need to go middle.

1004
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,150
We need to take this guy on to lacrosse.

1005
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:12,490
Alright.

1006
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,650
I mean, we have...

1007
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,470
Oh, there's a ring council!

1008
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,070
Yeah, that's where we're gonna go hit.

1009
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,470
There was a team here 30 times ago?

1010
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,290
Yeah.

1011
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,250
Get in the house!

1012
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,070
I mean, car.

1013
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,570
What the house?

1014
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,870
Alright, if there's a team here, just stay on the gondola.

1015
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,210
I'm not kidding.

1016
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,630
I can stick him with my arc.

1017
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,330
Alright.

1018
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,350
Okay, someone protect me while I do the ring council.

1019
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:33,910
Alright.

1020
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:33,910
Okay, someone protect me while I do the ring council.

1021
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,070
Yeah, this is extremely sketched, but I think we should...

1022
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,830
Yeah, I mean, if I die, you can craft me.

1023
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,110
Wait, we don't have anybody to craft.

1024
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,710
Okay, nevermind.

1025
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,430
No, we do not craft you.

1026
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,490
We don't have it.

1027
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,010
I'm just dead.

1028
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,390
Okay.

1029
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,410
I'm pretty sure we're like the only team...

1030
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,970
that has white armor right now.

1031
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,170
There's no fucking way.

1032
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,430
No, no, no.

1033
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:50,730
We're good.

1034
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,510
We're not the only team.

1035
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,730
Wait, why didn't we grab the fucking...

1036
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,530
There's a team over here.

1037
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,950
Why didn't we grab the cash right behind us?

1038
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,670
I don't need any evil cash.

1039
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,990
I'm blue, bitches!

1040
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,690
That's all you, buddy.

1041
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,990
I'm getting this cash for sure.

1042
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,990
I'm going with Wig just in case we get...

1043
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,350
I charge rifled him from 450 meters.

1044
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,570
We love that for you.

1045
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,150
Nice job, buddy.

1046
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:12,950
I'm proud of you.

1047
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,310
Alright, I'm out of here.

1048
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,470
Don't worry, guys.

1049
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,250
I am still gonna...

1050
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:18,770
I'm on our roof.

1051
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,190
fence this up.

1052
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,550
Another team flew in there.

1053
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,690
I'm gonna fence this up, guys.

1054
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,090
I'm doing it.

1055
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,870
We're playing in this building?

1056
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,050
We gotta move up now.

1057
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,970
We're gonna move up a little bit more.

1058
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,570
We can't really move right now anyway because we're stuck.

1059
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,770
We're stuck, Stepbro.

1060
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,670
I wanna go through like launch, but...

1061
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,230
Again, we don't have no evac towers.

1062
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,350
I don't think we're ever gonna find evac towers.

1063
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,130
I don't think so, guys.

1064
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,810
I got one!

1065
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,410
Go, Tempo!

1066
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,810
I've always believed in you!

1067
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,410
That's five stars!

1068
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:50,810
Oh my God!

1069
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,690
Tempo, Tempo, Tempo!

1070
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,410
Tempo!

1071
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,990
What the fuck are you doing?

1072
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,290
Oh my God!

1073
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,370
I'm safe.

1074
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,170
I'm covering.

1075
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,130
I got a kill.

1076
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,970
It was on the bridge.

1077
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,230
5 subs already?

1078
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,830
That's 5 subs to 10.5 subs to me.

1079
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,630
That's 10 subs.

1080
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:16,970
That's insane.

1081
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,250
We need to go command center.

1082
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,130
I can try.

1083
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:24,890
I can scan again.

1084
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,610
Let's believe it.

1085
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,570
Actually, yeah.

1086
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,210
There's no way someone is going to shoot me, right?

1087
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,330
There's no way.

1088
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:32,770
I'm watching.

1089
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,150
I'm watching.

1090
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,610
There's a team on south.

1091
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,490
A team just fenced up south.

1092
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,270
That's fine.

1093
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,510
We can just play near for now.

1094
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,030
I'm trying to find an evac.

1095
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,990
Can I play in the middle up here?

1096
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,230
Realistically, us getting out of the situation with that one is like...

1097
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,150
Yeah, we need...

1098
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,230
Unless everybody suddenly collides with each other.

1099
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,690
Let me get the south team.

1100
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,250
Alright.

1101
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,290
Just in case.

1102
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,190
We're good.

1103
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,170
Nice job, Doki.

1104
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,930
Look at me go.

1105
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,790
I'm fencing.

1106
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,830
I'm contributing to the team.

1107
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,630
I'm contributing to the team.

1108
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,770
Hell yeah.

1109
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,530
We're alive.

1110
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,610
That's also a W.

1111
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,690
I'll take NAW 20th all day, every day.

1112
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,550
I'm being so serious.

1113
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,810
Shit on, kid.

1114
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,130
Shit on, kid.

1115
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,060
We're okay.

1116
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,900
Everything will be fine.

1117
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,480
No one's north.

1118
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,500
No one's middle.

1119
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,420
I just realized, bro.

1120
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,740
My fucking... We all have...

1121
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,400
Wait, you guys got purple and blue backpacks?

1122
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,720
How did I end up with a white backpack?

1123
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,400
I had a fucking wick.

1124
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,820
Realistically, RV down here wouldn't be bad.

1125
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,040
I just don't know how the fuck we get there.

1126
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,560
How was I the one that ended up with the shittiest backpack out of all of you?

1127
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,420
There's a team on bridge, isn't there?

1128
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,940
Fuck me.

1129
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,860
I'm gonna go away.

1130
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,920
Yeah, the team on bridge is the one I got a knock on.

1131
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,320
Can we get underneath this platform if we run?

1132
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,260
Right now?

1133
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,980
I mean, I don't know when else we're gonna do it.

1134
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,440
I feel like...

1135
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,700
I mean, it's very risky.

1136
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,660
That's for sure.

1137
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,560
It definitely is risky.

1138
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,920
I don't think there's anyone on our right, though.

1139
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,520
At least we have a rotational spot later.

1140
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,160
I don't wanna play blue bins, because we're gonna go against the Gibraltar team who's gonna ult us.

1141
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,040
I have all...

1142
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,800
Wait, is this guy full-killed and not rez'd?

1143
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,040
Yeah, full-killed.

1144
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,540
Did you knock the team on the left?

1145
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,960
Well, we don't know who exactly...

1146
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,300
I killed a team on the bridge.

1147
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,220
Yeah, but...

1148
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,280
But they might have rez'd, because they have a rez beacon.

1149
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,280
Is the rez beacon activated?

1150
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,220
Yeah, it is.

1151
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,200
It's activated.

1152
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,740
I was gonna say, if we kill the team on the left, then we can go there.

1153
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,160
We could...

1154
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,260
Okay, but guys, we can scan again.

1155
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,940
Lowkey could.

1156
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,440
Well, actually, let's go back and do it.

1157
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1158
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,020
There's really no negative.

1159
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,500
This team's full-monus.

1160
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:51,900
We're good.

1161
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,400
They're gone.

1162
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,140
Yeah, exactly.

1163
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,060
We can do one last...

1164
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,100
A Gibraltar!

1165
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,880
Random Gibraltar on you!

1166
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,320
Wait, wait, wait.

1167
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:00,620
What the fuck did you do?

1168
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,160
Oh, he's down.

1169
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,460
He's downstairs.

1170
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,440
Where, where, where?

1171
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:02,900
He's running away.

1172
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,540
He's running away.

1173
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,320
Hit the beacon.

1174
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,480
Okay, okay, okay.

1175
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm going back up.

1176
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,760
I got really scared.

1177
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,400
Hit the beacon and run back to me immediately, because they're above you.

1178
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,720
Okay, that is not very... I don't know.

1179
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,280
I have a lot of confidence.

1180
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,800
But here we go.

1181
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,220
Nope.

1182
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,160
One dropped down.

1183
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,900
They went low ground, I think.

1184
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,260
Yeah, they're low ground over here.

1185
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:19,800
You're good.

1186
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,100
You're...

1187
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,560
We're still healthy.

1188
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,600
I still don't know...

1189
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,320
I did not see the Gibraltar at all.

1190
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,620
We need to get underneath, brothers.

1191
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,240
Wait, wait, wait.

1192
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,000
We have no evac.

1193
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,660
We have no... Gotta kill.

1194
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,680
Oh, he got... Oh, he got... Oh, he got...

1195
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:33,800
Oh, he gets up.

1196
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,460
That's 10 subs each.

1197
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,680
We need to move.

1198
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,000
We need to move.

1199
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,340
We need to move.

1200
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,140
Okay, okay.

1201
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,660
That's 10 subs each person.

1202
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,900
Oh, come over here.

1203
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,780
We're gonna come over here and play this.

1204
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,020
Oh my god.

1205
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,260
I have 12 nades.

1206
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,060
Okay.

1207
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,720
You're gonna set up your gen right here, Ducky.

1208
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,480
Right here?

1209
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,320
Okay, right now?

1210
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,580
Actually, wait.

1211
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,080
No, don't do that.

1212
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't do that.

1213
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,400
I wanna see if we can get an RV.

1214
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,820
If there's no one in an RV, we should get there underneath.

1215
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,160
Tempo, you think you could, like, fuse all these guys up here on the bridge that we run for RV?

1216
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,920
Yeah, let me find their wads and gen.

1217
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,700
It's right here.

1218
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,100
I can destroy it.

1219
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,600
Okay, I'm gonna keep fencing.

1220
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,060
I destroyed it.

1221
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,060
Whoa.

1222
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,020
Wait, there's a fuse queue somewhere.

1223
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,940
Oh, Jesus.

1224
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,360
No, they came from in front of us.

1225
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,440
We're fine.

1226
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:09,760
We're fine.

1227
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,180
Yeah, we're fine.

1228
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,980
We're still fucking fine.

1229
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,660
We're good.

1230
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:11,960
We're good.

1231
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,160
We're good.

1232
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,320
We're fine.

1233
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,060
Yeah, we're good.

1234
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,380
We're good.

1235
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,680
We're good.

1236
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:13,960
We're good.

1237
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,180
We just need to get in zone more, which sucks.

1238
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,120
Yeah, we are down.

1239
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,200
We're just at the... I don't even think we're in zone.

1240
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,100
Where's that scan coming from?

1241
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,660
Wait, what the fuck?

1242
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,500
Behind us.

1243
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:21,880
Behind us?

1244
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,620
Who the fuck is that?

1245
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,600
Bro, I'm fucking setting this up.

1246
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,880
Yeah, shut up.

1247
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,020
Shut up.

1248
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,280
They're pushing.

1249
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,500
They're pushing.

1250
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,120
They are?

1251
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,920
Like, 148 or 148.

1252
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,040
I'm kidding.

1253
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,860
I'm kidding.

1254
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,240
I'm kidding.

1255
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,660
I'm kidding.

1256
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,240
I'm a left team.

1257
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm a shot from the team in front of us.

1258
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:34,760
I'm here.

1259
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:34,940
I'm here.

1260
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,220
You're good.

1261
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,720
Yeah.

1262
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm gonna scan again.

1263
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,480
Okay, I'm good.

1264
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm good.

1265
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:38,940
I'm good here.

1266
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,580
I'm good now.

1267
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm good now.

1268
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,140
I don't see him.

1269
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,760
Should be still over here.

1270
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,340
I'm alright now, Swin.

1271
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,680
You're good.

1272
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,920
You're good.

1273
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,440
I think they want to push us in the back.

1274
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm checking.

1275
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,780
I don't think they're gonna push us in the back.

1276
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,260
Okay, they're not.

1277
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:50,560
They're not.

1278
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:50,780
They're not.

1279
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,000
They're not.

1280
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,640
They're just shooting at Jen.

1281
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,020
I've scanned 12 seconds.

1282
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,020
Okay.

1283
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,600
Jen, go down.

1284
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:53,960
It's okay.

1285
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,360
Yeah, yeah.

1286
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,740
It's pretty annoying, actually.

1287
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,120
They're leaving.

1288
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,360
They're leaving.

1289
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,700
They're gone.

1290
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,160
Alright, we need to go to RB now.

1291
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,780
We need to jump down.

1292
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,720
This is really bad for us, actually.

1293
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,820
Yeah, we don't have... Do you choose to ult with these guys or you don't have it anymore?

1294
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,280
No, he doesn't.

1295
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,780
I don't have it anymore.

1296
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,220
I don't have it anymore.

1297
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,500
Can you Q them?

1298
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,100
Can you Q them?

1299
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,160
Okay.

1300
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,460
We're gonna move left.

1301
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:07,900
We're gonna move left.

1302
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,180
Come left.

1303
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,060
I only have that one Q.

1304
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:09,940
Jump down.

1305
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,220
Jump down.

1306
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,000
We're good.

1307
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,200
We're good.

1308
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,460
Come down.

1309
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,760
We're so healthy.

1310
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,440
We're so good.

1311
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,860
We're so good.

1312
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,380
We're so good.

1313
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,200
Oh, we are not...

1314
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1315
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,800
Protect that.

1316
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,420
Protect that.

1317
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,500
Oh, keep blocking that.

1318
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,100
We're so healthy.

1319
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,340
Yeah, you're good.

1320
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,720
You're good.

1321
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,580
We're not in zone, but we're so healthy.

1322
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,280
I'm not in zone, but you're good.

1323
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,500
You're good.

1324
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,200
You're gonna play without me.

1325
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,500
You're gonna die in zone?

1326
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:26,980
Okay.

1327
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,640
That is all I needed to know.

1328
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:28,920
That's fine.

1329
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,340
That's fine.

1330
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,720
We're okay.

1331
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,540
Noqo killed me.

1332
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,140
What a piece of shit.

1333
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,100
You guys are good, man.

1334
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,120
I had a Moby on my death box, by the way.

1335
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,400
Oh, wait.

1336
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:34,860
Get it.

1337
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,180
Get it.

1338
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,520
Get it.

1339
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:35,780
Get it.

1340
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:35,940
Get it.

1341
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,080
I can get it and raise him here.

1342
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,120
Okay.

1343
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,040
You probably could, actually.

1344
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,440
You got this.

1345
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:39,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1346
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,100
Get it.

1347
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,300
Get it.

1348
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,540
Get it.

1349
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Temple, I believe in you.

1350
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,000
The zone doesn't hurt so much.

1351
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,780
Did you get the...

1352
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,160
He did not get the Moby.

1353
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,420
Okay.

1354
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,960
I'll get the Moby.

1355
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,340
I'll get the Moby.

1356
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,440
I'll get the Moby.

1357
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,400
Okay.

1358
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:50,820
Okay.

1359
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,720
What the fuck?

1360
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,480
I'm freezing my shirt.

1361
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:52,860
We're good.

1362
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,140
We're good.

1363
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,100
We're fine.

1364
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,760
We're fine.

1365
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,240
What?

1366
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,340
Let me shoot these guys up here.

1367
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,820
You rest.

1368
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,380
I'll rest.

1369
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,700
I'll rest.

1370
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,860
What the fuck did you do?

1371
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,720
I'm looking up on the bridge.

1372
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,280
I don't see them.

1373
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,820
Okay.

1374
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,160
I think we're okay, bro.

1375
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,920
How are we not getting looked at right now?

1376
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,000
What the fuck is going on?

1377
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,880
Don't take this wig.

1378
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,900
Don't cast it.

1379
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,100
Free KP over here.

1380
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,820
Don't do anything.

1381
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,660
We're good.

1382
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,080
We're good.

1383
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:12,980
I'm just kidding.

1384
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,980
I'm so fucking good.

1385
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,560
Don't worry.

1386
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,760
Fences will protect us.

1387
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,340
Alright.

1388
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
We need to get in that corner.

1389
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,080
They're fighting on bridge.

1390
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,820
You guys should go to RV right now.

1391
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,860
We were fighting bridge.

1392
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,120
RV, RV, RV.

1393
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,480
Let's go.

1394
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,860
Go without me, go without me.

1395
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,540
Go, go, go, go, go.

1396
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,820
They're not watching.

1397
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,880
They're not watching.

1398
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,620
They're watching now.

1399
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,980
Someone is inside the RV.

1400
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,200
What do you mean he's in the RV?

1401
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,140
What do you mean he's in the RV?

1402
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,800
He's flashed.

1403
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,580
RV is flashed.

1404
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,220
He got in the RV.

1405
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,320
Okay.

1406
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,680
Okay.

1407
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:45,760
Okay.

1408
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Great.

1409
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,560
We have a strat here though.

1410
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:46,940
We have a strat.

1411
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,260
One sec.

1412
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,080
We're gonna get in this corner over here, Celan, okay?

1413
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,940
You still have your mobi if you loot your body.

1414
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,460
I didn't loot it.

1415
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:51,780
I didn't loot it.

1416
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,500
He didn't loot his spot.

1417
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,080
I couldn't loot anything, damn.

1418
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,000
Wait, does that guy have a body?

1419
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:57,720
No.

1420
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,740
Oh, no.

1421
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,440
No, no, no, no.

1422
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,840
Okay, wait, Celan, we have a play.

1423
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,300
I'm not even kidding.

1424
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,700
We have a play.

1425
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,200
Okay?

1426
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,720
We're gonna get into this corner.

1427
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Come here.

1428
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,400
Okay.

1429
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,900
Come, come, come, come, come.

1430
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,580
Come to me.

1431
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,520
I don't know if I want to, but no.

1432
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,240
Oh, we're so good.

1433
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,540
We're healthy.

1434
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,320
Are you sure?

1435
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,140
That's a good placement.

1436
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,100
Yes, yes, yes, come here, come here.

1437
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:14,380
Trust us.

1438
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,900
Okay, okay, okay.

1439
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,440
I might die now because I hesitated.

1440
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,520
Oh, my God.

1441
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,800
Don't be a little bitch, you Celan.

1442
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,160
I hesitated.

1443
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,720
I hesitated.

1444
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,240
Movement.

1445
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,460
There's no way.

1446
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,640
There's no way there was a full team.

1447
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,980
There's no way.

1448
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,500
It didn't matter.

1449
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,340
It didn't matter.

1450
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:30,780
It didn't matter.

1451
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,860
There was a full team running at us.

1452
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,520
But no, they were on the other side of the rock.

1453
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,080
If we get there, we're vibing.

1454
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,240
Oh, my God.

1455
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:37,800
There's even full teams.

1456
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,120
Not a single evac.

1457
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,420
What are we supposed to do?

1458
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:42,980
It's okay.

1459
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,760
We got three kills because of tempo.

1460
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,620
We got three kills.

1461
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,440
We got four points.

1462
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,920
We got four points.

1463
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,380
Four points.

1464
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,080
I'll take...

1465
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,000
Four points is actually not bad.

1466
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,620
Actually...

1467
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,240
Four points is like the tenth place area.

1468
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,680
We're good.

1469
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
And also, no stand, no evac.

1470
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:57,740
We're good.

1471
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,800
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1472
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,060
Of course, I got a fucking pyro howl.

1473
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,580
Fuck me, man.

1474
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,280
Tempo, go over there and hold his PC hostage right now.

1475
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,900
Yeah, Tempo, run in there, bro, and summon his monitor immediately.

1476
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:12,960
Okay.

1477
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,700
Yeah, yeah.

1478
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,220
Run over there, take his monitor, show it on stream, and give Hal a message.

1479
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:21,460
Yeah.

1480
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,500
Snipe down, killed you, and Hal.

1481
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,280
I got a tag team, bro.

1482
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,240
I got Eiffel Towered by the fucking XTSM.

1483
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,900
Guys, we got four kills, and we didn't die 20th.

1484
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,820
That's all that matters.

1485
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,780
I'm not gonna lie.

1486
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,660
That was pretty good.

1487
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,720
Yeah, that was pretty good with the situation we were in.

1488
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,620
Yeah, that situation was pretty terrible.

1489
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,560
Yeah, that was pretty terrible.

1490
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,540
Pretty fucking terrible.

1491
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:42,940
I'm not gonna lie.

1492
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,200
I feel like that's what we say every time.

1493
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,740
We're like, that was really bad for us, but we did kinda good.

1494
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,100
That's what we say.

1495
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,600
That's like our motto.

1496
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,680
Okay, Tempo, how many kills you got?

1497
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,060
We got a lot.

1498
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,560
He got two kills, so that's 10 subs each.

1499
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:58,860
Fuck me.

1500
00:44:59,140 --> 00:44:59,380
Yeah.

1501
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,540
Pay up.

1502
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,620
Oh, shit.

1503
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm torched.

1504
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,160
Oh my god, my moderator's still alive.

1505
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:06,500
W.

1506
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,780
Your moderator is...

1507
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,220
Yeah, he is.

1508
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,080
Alucard is the coach.

1509
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,940
Okay, if he has a high placement, then I'm torched.

1510
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,220
If so, give us some of his prize winnings.

1511
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,020
Alright, I'm back.

1512
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,940
That is the key.

1513
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,740
Okay, that's how it works, we don't pay him to be my mod.

1514
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,580
But I still take a percentage of his win.

1515
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:23,980
Yeah.

1516
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,340
Our money now.

1517
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:29,820
100%.

1518
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,920
That's exactly how Twitch works.

1519
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,540
Yeah.

1520
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,380
Lowkey.

1521
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,520
We're still alive.

1522
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:35,900
Oh, sweet.

1523
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,500
Still alive, of course.

1524
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,020
And the prize is COC Clan just going crazy.

1525
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,300
Fuck.

1526
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,920
This is so funny.

1527
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,900
Only an enemy is dead.

1528
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:42,920
Oh, no one's dead.

1529
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,660
I think if we had zone in any way, we definitely would have lived longer.

1530
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,980
Oh no, if we had zone, we could have went to Lava Siphon, took the loot, you know what I mean?

1531
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,200
Yeah, we would have been so healthy.

1532
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,640
I wanted to get that RV pretty bad.

1533
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,600
We got that RV earlier where we could have killed an RV.

1534
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,680
We sort of lost somebody.

1535
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,380
Wait, Eroko!

1536
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,140
He came out of the RV solo!

1537
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,920
Bro, I thought 4-2 was there!

1538
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,160
I didn't realize anyone was there and I'm just nading the bridge.

1539
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,980
And then, Eroko just comes out and then I have to mark him.

1540
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,680
Bro, the guy was so confident that I thought it was a full team so I went to the side.

1541
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,520
No, I mean we did.

1542
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,380
We obviously did a good job.

1543
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,260
We got in there and we killed him.

1544
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,640
We could have died.

1545
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,960
Realistically, I should have got a kill on the Gibraltar up top too.

1546
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,400
I almost one-closed him for like a thousand levels.

1547
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:24,900
That was crazy.

1548
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,040
Probably the only time I'll have a good shot today.

1549
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,380
It's okay.

1550
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,840
This is our peak, guys.

1551
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,640
This is the best gameplay you're going to see out of all of us.

1552
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,140
This is the start of the damage.

1553
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,060
We get plus one kill after every game.

1554
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,920
Yeah, there's no way we can beat that.

1555
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,260
Nothing kills game six.

1556
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,660
There's no way we can be last because we already started out strong with kills.

1557
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:57,380
I was hoping someone would mis-pick a legend and they'd get minus five and then they'd get like bottom five and then their scoreboard is just negative.

1558
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,560
Did anyone mis-pick a legend?

1559
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,440
There must have been one person.

1560
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,720
They said they were going to restart if they...

1561
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,880
Bro, what the fuck, babies?

1562
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,160
Funny teams up, 59 players alive.

1563
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,420
Okay, nice.

1564
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,640
I mean, not nice.

1565
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,920
Not nice.

1566
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,860
Not nice.

1567
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,100
They're already two people over advantage.

1568
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,420
It's called survival of the fittest.

1569
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,900
We were able to...

1570
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,640
We were able to connect.

1571
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,520
We were able to evolve to what we are.

1572
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,100
We didn't survive the fittest.

1573
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,100
I did not do this tournament so Imperial Howl can make more money.

1574
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,740
Why the fuck did you...

1575
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,300
You should have not invited him.

1576
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,960
Why the fuck did you...

1577
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,280
That would go so well.

1578
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,240
Thank God.

1579
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,120
We'll take second place.

1580
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,460
Alright, wait, wait.

1581
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:45,840
Okay.

1582
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,520
It's like everybody's invited except for Hal.

1583
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,280
That was like... having those comps were kind of fun.

1584
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,460
I kind of like seeing the legend numbers.

1585
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,040
That was a good time.

1586
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:55,440
Yeah.

1587
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,200
I can't believe I got hit with a sentinel and then a repeater when I died like that.

1588
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,940
That was so fast.

1589
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,400
Yeah.

1590
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,780
I don't know.

1591
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,180
I feel like even if I trusted you, Wig, we would have still died.

1592
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,540
Oh, no, no.

1593
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,640
I don't know.

1594
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:11,820
I don't know.

1595
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,200
Even if I trusted you and we ran at the same time, we still...

1596
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,280
You would have still died.

1597
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,120
I don't know because I got...

1598
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,720
Yeah, probably.

1599
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:19,320
Yeah.

1600
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:19,820
No, no.

1601
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,600
They were already heading towards you.

1602
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,140
They were...

1603
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,360
Yeah.

1604
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,260
Hal scanning a duo is just...

1605
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:25,760
It's GG's.

1606
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,520
I think he just literally started foaming out of his mouth.

1607
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,460
He was so ready for it.

1608
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,340
He scans us.

1609
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,220
He just swipes us for sure.

1610
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,380
Damn you, Tempo.

1611
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,920
My God.

1612
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,660
It's fucking awesome.

1613
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,740
I'm so happy.

1614
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,080
I'm so happy.

1615
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,060
I'm so happy.

1616
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,120
Who was charged rifle?

1617
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,620
Who was charged rifle?

1618
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:47,740
Who was charged rifle?

1619
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh,

1620
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:53,880
it was me.

1621
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,260
Oh my God.

1622
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,820
I'm gonna take credit.

1623
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,060
Oh no.

1624
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,660
Peep got DC'd?

1625
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,400
Fuck, that sucks.

1626
00:48:59,420 --> 00:48:59,900
We didn't restart?

1627
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,240
Oh.

1628
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,980
Did I ask for a non-mode or does it not matter?

1629
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,700
Oh, it doesn't really matter.

1630
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,600
No, no.

1631
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,100
Don't ask for a...

1632
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,220
Don't ask for a...

1633
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,600
No, wait, wait.

1634
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,100
Don't ask for...

1635
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,420
It'd be more fun.

1636
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,160
It'd be really bad.

1637
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,180
It's gonna make me really mad.

1638
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,360
I need to go to their channels and clip them raging.

1639
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,540
Oh my god.

1640
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,460
Oh my god.

1641
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,280
I need to know who I'm killing.

1642
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,240
His little YouTube compilation.

1643
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,860
He's gonna make the pros rage at me.

1644
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,220
Apex Legends compilation.

1645
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,560
You won't believe which pro got angry at me.

1646
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,160
Yeah, I'm gonna help you with the clickbait titles.

1647
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,660
You're so good at that.

1648
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,090
Wait, what do we...

1649
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,670
Do we get our subs?

1650
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,690
Bang, Wraith, Octane, Valk, Seer, Cat, Newcastle, Conduit.

1651
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,590
Oh, they announced it?

1652
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:56,810
Okay.

1653
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,030
Oh, I can do Catalyst.

1654
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,350
I'll do the controller.

1655
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,810
Oh wait, they announced the Legends?

1656
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1657
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:09,770
Bang, Wraith, Octane, Valk, Seer, Newcastle, and Conduit.

1658
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,650
Because Doki's going Cat.

1659
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:12,830
Yeah.

1660
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,830
We have Valk!

1661
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:14,850
We have Valk!

1662
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,050
I mean, I mean, wait, wait, wait.

1663
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,630
That means you can take Octane and I'll take Valk.

1664
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,150
Do we trust Temple or Valk?

1665
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,210
This is where I'm supposed to think, right?

1666
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,790
Wait, who played Valk when we played last time?

1667
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:31,810
That was me.

1668
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,050
You played Watson and Doki played...

1669
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,510
Well, yeah, Doki played...

1670
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,470
What did I play?

1671
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:39,850
Bang, Bang.

1672
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:40,230
Bang?

1673
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,730
Oh yeah, but Bang's nerfed, right?

1674
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,130
Yeah, she, I mean, yeah, she's not bad though.

1675
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,710
Wait, isn't like the Bang smoke something something?

1676
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:54,170
You said two words and then the words that mattered was not there.

1677
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,950
Well, something changed.

1678
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,350
I just don't know what the something was, okay?

1679
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,550
A lot of things changed, Temple.

1680
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,370
You gotta be more specific here.

1681
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,350
Alright, my brain is telling me I should play Valk but my heart's saying Octane.

1682
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,910
You should listen to your brain.

1683
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,970
The times you've listened to your heart.

1684
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,730
Oh, you're still right.

1685
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,310
My heart told me to pick you guys and my brain was like, what the fuck are you doing?

1686
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,930
So maybe I should have listened to my brain in that situation.

1687
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:25,750
Yeah.

1688
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:26,690
So in this situation...

1689
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,710
We're not last place.

1690
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,610
Just so you know, your heart picked us.

1691
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,570
You're right.

1692
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,090
My heart didn't pick you guys, which is the right choice.

1693
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,550
So I'm going Octane next game.

1694
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:34,990
Who are you guys playing?

1695
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:36,890
Okay, then I'll take Valk.

1696
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:37,570
Okay.

1697
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,270
Wait, next game.

1698
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,470
Okay.

1699
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,450
Yeah, so we can play.

1700
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,990
And then I'll do Catalyst.

1701
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,910
Yeah, you can do Cat, Bang, whoever you're comfortable with.

1702
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,210
All right.

1703
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:44,990
I'll do Cat.

1704
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,910
We need zone readers.

1705
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,390
Yeah, this could be a good zone.

1706
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:53,670
When I am the rational one in this team, that's when you know things are bad.

1707
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,630
Oh, wait, my Valk has a... Oh, no, wait, no, it's the challenges.

1708
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,750
My Valk is locked.

1709
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:05,210
Wait, has Wake... Tempo, did Wake give you 10 subs yet?

1710
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,210
No, I'll do it after.

1711
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:07,890
Oh, okay.

1712
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:08,830
Oh, we stacked them up.

1713
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,750
We're going to stack 100.

1714
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,510
Every time you get a kill, it's a plus five.

1715
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:11,890
Just remind me.

1716
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,170
I'll remember that.

1717
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,330
Okay.

1718
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,390
Tempo, he's going to literally fund your lifestyle.

1719
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:16,530
Wait, what map are we on?

1720
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,950
We're on Storm Point.

1721
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:21,410
Storm Point.

1722
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:21,890
Storm Point?

1723
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,290
Okay.

1724
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,730
Storm Point is blue, right?

1725
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:24,730
Storm Point, we're going Command.

1726
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,790
So can we get Valk all the way out of that, right?

1727
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:27,450
Yeah.

1728
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,490
Oh, yeah.

1729
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:29,690
Oh, we're good, guys.

1730
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:30,630
We're so good.

1731
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,690
We're so healthy.

1732
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:31,930
We're so healthy.

1733
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,270
We're so healthy.

1734
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:32,870
We're so healthy.

1735
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,070
I was trying to pick my Valk.

1736
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:35,870
Oh, sorry.

1737
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,510
My skin.

1738
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:37,910
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1739
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,830
I need to pick my skins.

1740
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,190
Okay.

1741
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:42,690
You're right.

1742
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:43,030
You're right.

1743
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,290
I need to rearrange my badges.

1744
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:48,190
Oh, wait.

1745
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:48,930
My Valk badge.

1746
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:49,410
Yeah.

1747
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:49,730
Yeah.

1748
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:49,930
Yeah.

1749
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:50,070
Yeah.

1750
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:50,850
My tribal badge on.

1751
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,290
I was going to play...

1752
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,930
I already forgot what I was playing.

1753
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:54,310
Catalyst.

1754
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:54,710
Catalyst.

1755
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,070
Yes.

1756
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,450
Banner.

1757
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:56,810
Banner.

1758
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:58,870
Don't worry.

1759
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,130
I'm going to make sure everybody knows what rank I'm in.

1760
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:09,630
I just want you to know I have zero kills on Catalyst.

1761
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:10,150
Yeah.

1762
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,910
I think I also have zero.

1763
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:15,970
Wait a minute!

1764
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,970
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

1765
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,210
I was too busy with Jeb Burton.

1766
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:21,970
What did you just say?

1767
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,710
I have zero kills on Kat.

1768
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:24,530
Zero Kat kills.

1769
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,110
And you chose Kat over Ben?

1770
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:30,770
Yeah.

1771
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,350
Yeah.

1772
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,230
What is Kat's passive?

1773
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,150
She can...

1774
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,650
lock doors.

1775
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:40,830
Oh wait no that's a door.

1776
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,270
Nevermind.

1777
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,230
She can throw out the spikes.

1778
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,890
She can throw out the spikes.

1779
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,190
She can lock the doors.

1780
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,970
Lock the doors is crazy.

1781
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:53,490
Yeah.

1782
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,490
I mean technically it's locking doors.

1783
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,290
And then she can...

1784
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,070
She can put up a wall.

1785
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:03,930
And...

1786
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,310
And she looks...

1787
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,130
She looks slay while doing it.

1788
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,790
She does look slay.

1789
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:16,190
To be honest.

1790
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,630
I'm so happy Trick2G is playing bro.

1791
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,790
I used to watch Trick2G like everyday.

1792
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:24,670
In League.

1793
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,990
When I was an avid League player and I wanted to fucking...

1794
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,970
cry everyday.

1795
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,770
That's who I watched.

1796
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:30,890
Oh yeah that's what I was going to say.

1797
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:31,610
You played League.

1798
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,650
I was going to say like are you okay?

1799
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,190
Are you okay?

1800
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,070
Are you okay?

1801
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:37,630
Two years playing.

1802
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,690
Silver 2 Peak.

1803
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,010
Silver 2 Peak?

1804
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,410
Yeah.

1805
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,550
You're like that...

1806
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,150
Oh wait.

1807
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,750
I don't know if I can say it.

1808
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:49,330
You're like that one guy that was like silver or something.

1809
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,630
And he played League his whole career.

1810
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,610
And then...

1811
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,950
And then he tried to own an esport org.

1812
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,150
You know that guy.

1813
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,930
Sam Baikman Fried?

1814
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,070
Yeah the crypto dude?

1815
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:02,630
He just got 25 years in jail.

1816
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:03,750
Yeah I saw that.

1817
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,390
This is true we can talk about it because Tempo is here.

1818
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,850
Oh true.

1819
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:10,550
That's true.

1820
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,990
What was the fucking code again?

1821
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:13,930
FTX?

1822
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:15,930
FTX yeah.

1823
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:16,790
Hey Tempo.

1824
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,890
What was it called again?

1825
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,650
Tempo you remember that...

1826
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,770
That coin that had a deal with TSM?

1827
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,510
That promised you guys like 200 million dollars?

1828
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,550
That guy.

1829
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:31,550
The one that's been like apparently like bronze or whatever after 10 years of League.

1830
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,370
So then he decided to own an esport org.

1831
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,650
That guy.

1832
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:41,190
That guy.

1833
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,950
Well it's a good thing we can talk about it.

1834
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,610
Yeah he should be able to openly talk about this.

1835
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:46,930
You know?

1836
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,890
It's for KTempo.

1837
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,690
That whole shit is actually crazy.

1838
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,910
Yeah I'm surprised.

1839
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,190
Like I'm surprised he got away.

1840
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,710
He almost got away with it.

1841
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,850
Until he got 25 years in prison.

1842
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,390
I don't even know that's enough though.

1843
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,630
That was like the biggest heist ever.

1844
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:05,330
Yeah he almost got away with it too.

1845
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,070
Yeah he almost got away with it too.

1846
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:08,950
He was just meddling kids.

1847
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,590
I'm trying to pull that out again.

1848
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,430
35 million.

1849
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:14,930
35 years.

1850
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,710
Yeah he made an entire esport org to change their fucking name.

1851
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,390
Yeah and he also paid off a fucking um...

1852
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,710
There's another... there's like a basketball team I think.

1853
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:25,310
Oh yeah!

1854
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:26,730
With crypto!

1855
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,390
Yeah yeah yeah.

1856
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,290
Crazy.

1857
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,650
That's actually insane.

1858
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,370
He did everything with that money.

1859
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,070
He did everything with that money to actually do what he was supposed to do.

1860
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:34,970
I'm back guys.

1861
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,850
Yeah oh you missed that whole thing huh?

1862
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:37,690
You missed our whole thing.

1863
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,710
We're in like 9th place.

1864
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,250
We're top 10!

1865
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,770
We're like tied for 9th.

1866
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,470
There's like 5 people with 4 points.

1867
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:45,370
Nice.

1868
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,490
We got this.

1869
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,630
Alright wait what?

1870
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,150
What?

1871
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:54,530
I was like they started showing the standings and I was so invested to see where we were.

1872
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:55,630
You were so invested.

1873
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:56,710
I completely zoned out.

1874
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,230
That's good.

1875
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,970
We were talking really great about TSM.

1876
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,210
Oh okay.

1877
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:02,710
Yeah.

1878
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,290
That's good.

1879
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:03,690
That's good.

1880
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:05,630
Yeah don't worry.

1881
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,830
We're hyping TSM up.

1882
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,510
So you won't get fired.

1883
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:09,690
Never.

1884
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:10,210
Never.

1885
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,130
We will never do that.

1886
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:12,790
About that?

1887
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:13,190
Hello?

1888
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,110
Something you didn't tell us or what?

1889
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:16,730
Whoa.

1890
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,590
Temple.

1891
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,570
Temple what happened?

1892
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,670
Can I sleep on your couch?

1893
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:23,930
I told you bro.

1894
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,450
Lan my couch is yours.

1895
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:26,610
I got you a blanket.

1896
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,730
I got you on warm milk at night if you need.

1897
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:29,970
Like whatever you want bro I'm down.

1898
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,470
Bro was this before us?

1899
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,670
Morning juice box and everything.

1900
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,510
You'll actually be treated like a king in my apartment.

1901
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,010
Holy shit.

1902
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,110
When Vaxcon slept over he didn't have a blanket.

1903
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,010
He had to use one of the pillows as a blanket.

1904
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,490
I'm taking all your juice.

1905
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,670
Wait are they kicking you out of the house?

1906
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:49,090
No.

1907
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,030
This is for right or I was about to say this is for Twitch rivals.

1908
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,450
Oh.

1909
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:54,950
Are you going to LAN?

1910
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,510
No.

1911
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,170
Wait is that in LA?

1912
00:57:58,690 --> 00:57:59,170
Yeah.

1913
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,250
What date is it?

1914
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,050
What is it?

1915
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:03,750
May 2nd.

1916
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,570
May 2nd.

1917
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:06,370
Okay that's like a far.

1918
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,990
I still have time to think about it.

1919
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,270
When am I going to be on your fucking B stream?

1920
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,810
When can I roll up?

1921
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,270
Yeah literally roll up on an iPad?

1922
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,050
Yeah roll up on an iPad.

1923
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,550
You got to actually buy one of those.

1924
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,410
No Tempo is going to buy it for me.

1925
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,430
Huh?

1926
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:22,310
Huh?

1927
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,690
The most broke one out of the three?

1928
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,110
I thought you had a plan.

1929
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,070
Don't you have a million subs on YouTube?

1930
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,790
No no no no no no no no.

1931
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,230
No no no I'm not a million.

1932
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:33,370
I'm not a million.

1933
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,070
I'm like I'm a poor.

1934
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:37,730
I'm very tiny.

1935
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,270
I'm a very tiny streamer.

1936
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,150
I just started a month ago guys.

1937
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,530
I just started a month ago.

1938
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,550
Oh so true.

1939
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:47,990
You're brand new to this.

1940
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,990
I charge up a little sweet in the side of the head for 140.

1941
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,130
I'm just a natural entertainer.

1942
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:53,810
Good for you.

1943
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,910
I don't know.

1944
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,250
I have no idea.

1945
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,170
He typed it not me.

1946
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,010
I thought you had the setup already.

1947
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,010
Because you were going to do it on last LAN.

1948
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:03,690
What happened?

1949
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,530
I didn't buy it.

1950
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,850
I didn't buy the roller coaster thing.

1951
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:07,950
Of course you didn't buy it.

1952
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:09,170
You didn't buy it?

1953
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,210
You literally told me like oh TSA won't let me do it.

1954
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,650
I have the iPad.

1955
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,370
Yes he has the iPad.

1956
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:16,950
I have the tablet.

1957
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:18,650
I need the rolling thingy with the wheels.

1958
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:25,830
I need connections with the A staff.

1959
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,810
Let me go talk to Chen.

1960
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,810
We can literally convince them.

1961
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,590
Because it's in LA instead of London.

1962
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,430
We don't have to get a plane.

1963
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,790
We can return it to the respawn.

1964
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:36,250
Exactly.

1965
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:40,310
And then they can reuse it every time I want to butt in.

1966
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:40,850
Oh.

1967
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:44,250
You can playtest with the rolling iPad.

1968
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:44,870
No we cannot.

1969
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,070
She's going to go straight into me.

1970
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,530
Terrorize all the staff that are working.

1971
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,730
No I'm just...

1972
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,090
We need to pay attention here.

1973
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,030
We might be conned guys.

1974
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,150
We might be conned?

1975
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,010
Maybe.

1976
00:59:59,150 --> 00:59:59,690
I don't know.

1977
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,610
We have no beacon.

1978
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:02,570
Again?

1979
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,830
What the fuck is the point of this?

1980
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,130
We have no beacon character.

1981
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,230
Of course we have no beacon.

1982
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:09,750
We didn't pick a control character.

1983
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:10,370
We're just rolling.

1984
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,830
Wait.

1985
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:13,690
No I mean a map scan.

1986
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,130
Oh wait.

1987
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:16,450
Wait.

1988
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,450
No I'm Katniss.

1989
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,150
Katniss can scan maps.

1990
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,450
You're literally the fucking casting.

1991
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:24,850
I'm watching.

1992
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:30,010
You watch so many Apex streams that you still don't know who's the controller.

1993
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,550
I forgot you were on Tat bro.

1994
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,490
I forgot.

1995
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:33,930
Oh my gosh.

1996
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,030
We have the...

1997
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,630
Don't you forget it.

1998
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,730
I'm so confused.

1999
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,890
I have a jump tower.

2000
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:46,490
Guys.

2001
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,650
We're so set.

2002
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,350
On me.

2003
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,590
On me.

2004
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:48,790
On me.

2005
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,010
I told you I knew it.

2006
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,490
We're actually getting contested?

2007
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,010
No way I'm getting contested in my own tournament.

2008
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:56,570
Yeah.

2009
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,810
What the fuck.

2010
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,610
They saw us.

2011
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,390
I see one all the way up there.

2012
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,690
We want to get height.

2013
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:04,530
That's the problem here.

2014
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:07,130
Can we not take this now?

2015
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,930
No I don't think we can.

2016
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,850
They're covering it.

2017
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,490
Bro they're taking it.

2018
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:13,010
Right now.

2019
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:15,310
Your audio.

2020
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,630
My audio is back on.

2021
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,230
You had no audio?

2022
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:19,810
Bro.

2023
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,530
Where is someone we can rotate to that has it?

2024
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,730
I forgot I lowered my old char...

2025
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:25,890
You didn't ping the charge.

2026
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:28,190
I'm sorry I was a little bit confluxed.

2027
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,010
Here he is at 6x.

2028
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:31,330
Oh 6x.

2029
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,890
They're leaving.

2030
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,290
Oh I'm rich.

2031
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,530
Alright I don't have any.

2032
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:37,890
They're leaving.

2033
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,290
We're going to go over to where they were and we're going to go on the zip line again.

2034
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,390
We want to take height.

2035
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:41,930
We definitely do.

2036
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,290
I'm right behind you.

2037
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,490
If anything happens.

2038
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,090
That's fine thank you.

2039
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:51,830
If anything happens we can not craft you because we don't have that.

2040
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:52,990
Wait what?

2041
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:53,450
They're still here.

2042
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:55,890
Did they shoot you Tempo?

2043
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,090
They shot you?

2044
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:59,510
They're pushing this.

2045
01:01:59,550 --> 01:01:59,850
Go back.

2046
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:00,430
We don't want to fight this.

2047
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:00,710
Just leave.

2048
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:01,570
Yeah.

2049
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,670
Going through this door then?

2050
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,530
I'm going to lock the door.

2051
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,290
I just don't know if this zone is going this way and we're going to get ran at.

2052
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,470
Because this zone actually looks like it could be.

2053
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,250
Let's take this house to our right side right now.

2054
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:13,390
Alright.

2055
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,490
I'd rather just be safe.

2056
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,570
And just go to wall later.

2057
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,030
We can grab the...

2058
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,010
The cash thing after.

2059
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,150
Yeah I'm down.

2060
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,370
Okay guys I haven't played Catalyst in a while.

2061
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,770
So how many spikes can I do?

2062
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,650
Back back back.

2063
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:31,970
Back back back.

2064
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:33,070
Should we go to the bottom one?

2065
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:33,790
Yeah just go down.

2066
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:36,930
I'm heading down.

2067
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:39,910
We're so messy.

2068
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,310
Oh shit I just went straight up.

2069
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,990
No don't die there please.

2070
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,530
We're going to play for here right now and see what goes on.

2071
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,810
We got the Evo cash here as well.

2072
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:49,730
Suck it.

2073
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:53,270
Just pay attention there's definitely someone that could be posting up coming at us.

2074
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:54,830
I'm locking the door.

2075
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,570
Yeah yeah just set up right now.

2076
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,170
We're getting hoed right now.

2077
01:02:59,250 --> 01:02:59,630
I'm pretty hard.

2078
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,990
And I'm locking this door.

2079
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,390
These people don't like us apparently.

2080
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:05,670
Sucks.

2081
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:08,970
I am like not confident right now.

2082
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,950
We got the Evo cash right?

2083
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:11,130
I'm so confident.

2084
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,390
Actually we're not in like a bad spot regardless of where the sound goes.

2085
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,870
What about our loot?

2086
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:21,710
We can go over to wall after this and just probably get Evo cash.

2087
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,830
I don't see someone was shooting us from here but I don't see them anywhere.

2088
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,470
I don't know either.

2089
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:28,350
I have like no long range so I'm just going to...

2090
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,370
Oh there's a longbow here for anybody.

2091
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,930
I would take that ammo.

2092
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:37,370
I'm going to run this then for long range.

2093
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,270
I dropped a vault if anyone wants to.

2094
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,130
I have a vault already.

2095
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:44,670
This team is not staying on the height of that building which is making me think it's not going here.

2096
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,550
Oh wait someone just landed on top.

2097
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,050
Yes, maybe they think it is going over there which is pretty good.

2098
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,150
I think we just stay in this house for now.

2099
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,450
Yeah let's just not waste any loot because we're very poor.

2100
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,030
Don't have a lot of it.

2101
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,010
Yeah we're free.

2102
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,950
We're pretty poor right now.

2103
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,130
Would anyone kind of like to donate loot to us?

2104
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:02,490
Please we need it.

2105
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:03,350
Please.

2106
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,510
If anybody stream sniping us.

2107
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,990
Wait Doki do you have Q's at all?

2108
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:10,730
Yeah.

2109
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,050
Can you try to put one on the window just for the peek?

2110
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,170
Oh yeah sure.

2111
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,290
I think you can.

2112
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:20,210
Wait the team on height is shooting someone that's going this way.

2113
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:20,830
Alright.

2114
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,510
That's not great.

2115
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,330
Is that alright?

2116
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,870
Yeah for visual clutter it doesn't matter.

2117
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:29,830
They just dropped back down to...

2118
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:31,970
They're not on height anymore.

2119
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,530
I'm stressed.

2120
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,930
Are you stressed out about?

2121
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,990
We have good position.

2122
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:43,830
We should loot but like as long as they don't come in and kill us.

2123
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:45,250
I'm covering a cell.

2124
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,010
Yeah only problem is we're just triple wiped.

2125
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,190
Someone shoots that thing and I'm like ooo.

2126
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,930
Okay then just don't get shot.

2127
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,810
We're in the cure packs can't we skin them?

2128
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:54,990
I tried I didn't look quick enough I'm an idiot.

2129
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,030
Oh wait they're fighting in cascades.

2130
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:58,150
That's fine.

2131
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,790
Yeah yeah try to farm some shit.

2132
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,410
Yeah yeah yeah you farm for us we're just gonna look be here.

2133
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,130
Yeah you get your shield up buddy.

2134
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:08,950
I have 4 cells.

2135
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:10,710
Okay I have some here.

2136
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:14,390
Oh my god do you guys remember the strat that we were supposed to do last time?

2137
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:14,990
I have 2 beds.

2138
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:21,870
Where like uh you know remember the one where we let tempo drop wherever the fuck he wants and then...

2139
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:22,550
Oh my god.

2140
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,450
I do remember that one.

2141
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,370
Oh my god.

2142
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,690
We never did that strat.

2143
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,310
We did that so bad.

2144
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:31,510
We got last game today.

2145
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:32,950
We did that.

2146
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:33,950
Yeah tempo chopper.

2147
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,390
Oh shit he's in that room.

2148
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:38,190
Of course.

2149
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,350
Of course he is.

2150
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,650
On roof we're dead here.

2151
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:41,230
We're so dead.

2152
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,950
We need to go wall slot.

2153
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:45,230
I'm leaving I'm leaving.

2154
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,150
I'm leaving I'm leaving.

2155
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,890
I'm leaving.

2156
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:53,470
We should have made tempo.

2157
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,990
We should have made tempo.

2158
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,930
Were you on top of the building tempo?

2159
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:59,090
Yeah he was by the way.

2160
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:01,050
Okay no idea I'm here.

2161
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:02,910
I'm dead.

2162
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:03,370
I'm dead.

2163
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,930
Yes it doesn't matter.

2164
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:06,770
Drop got me.

2165
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,930
They're sending us.

2166
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,410
They're pushing us.

2167
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:12,830
You should have ran.

2168
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,870
You shouldn't have been a hero.

2169
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,750
Oh my god.

2170
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:19,050
We got 20 in tempo.

2171
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:21,850
Tempo we got.

2172
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:22,950
Tempo man.

2173
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,950
We got last tempo.

2174
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,010
Tempo.

2175
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:31,310
Tempo.

2176
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,490
Wait we're not center zone.

2177
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,210
Oh probably.

2178
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,710
In that zone we were.

2179
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:39,190
Tempo.

2180
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,890
We actually got 20.

2181
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,350
I know.

2182
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,210
Does this game hate us?

2183
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,110
Okay what if like in our third game.

2184
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,130
We let tempo land.

2185
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,390
We let tempo go wherever the fuck he wants.

2186
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:56,450
No cause no no.

2187
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,810
Cause this next game is Olympus.

2188
01:06:59,090 --> 01:06:59,850
We have phase drivers.

2189
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,550
That's what you said about last game.

2190
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:02,630
We have infinite balls.

2191
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,070
But what if we get contested one though.

2192
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:08,370
No.

2193
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,370
Oh we might get contested.

2194
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:13,110
I mean it's cause people see our names.

2195
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:13,470
Like yo.

2196
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:16,190
Oh fuck.

2197
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,710
We do not want to fight that guy.

2198
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,710
I thought you said we had good feeling.

2199
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,470
I'm working on my own tournament dude.

2200
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,710
What's going on.

2201
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:24,930
Let me go find some.

2202
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,750
Is there anyone that's free tempo?

2203
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:29,170
Olympus.

2204
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,190
I can't believe it.

2205
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,330
I can't believe it.

2206
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,070
I can't believe it.

2207
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:36,670
That was so tough dude.

2208
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:39,330
Super unfortunate.

2209
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:39,790
Super unfortunate.

2210
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,550
Wait this is why you don't follow your heart.

2211
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:43,910
I mean.

2212
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,910
Why am I getting contested at command center bro.

2213
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:49,090
You followed your heart.

2214
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:51,490
And then we got 20 in place.

2215
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,310
And we go command center no beacon.

2216
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:54,910
And we go command center no beacon.

2217
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:55,550
And then we got contested.

2218
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,990
My strategy is just fucked out the window there.

2219
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,250
Because the whole point is I wanted to get beacon.

2220
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,390
Then valko will come up there so we don't have to shoot for the rest of the game.

2221
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:03,670
We just know exactly where to go.

2222
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:07,830
Cause tempo is sitting on top of roofs.

2223
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:09,670
Yeah.

2224
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,010
With his back.

2225
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,110
No comment.

2226
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:14,770
With his back.

2227
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:16,750
Very bottom.

2228
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,650
I was shooting someone.

2229
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:22,290
I was shooting cascades.

2230
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:24,070
And then I don't know where those guys came from.

2231
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:25,670
They were in the house next to us.

2232
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,050
Alright we'll shoot at these guys.

2233
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:28,970
I found a map.

2234
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,790
Did we get zero points?

2235
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:31,090
No.

2236
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:32,990
Yes we were 20.

2237
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,450
I wasn't sure if we got a kill or not.

2238
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,630
Or if tempo worked some magic with that charge rifle.

2239
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:38,690
I wasn't sure.

2240
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:40,850
Get revenge.

2241
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,410
No one is good.

2242
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,250
Tempo what's free?

2243
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:47,550
What's free for the next map?

2244
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:48,050
We are moving on.

2245
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:48,950
Remember like a goldfish.

2246
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,050
What's free?

2247
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,890
Where is the laces?

2248
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,630
What's free?

2249
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:58,150
What's free?

2250
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:58,890
Do we have anything?

2251
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,950
Is there...

2252
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,250
We should...

2253
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,490
Oh my god.

2254
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,610
I have an idea.

2255
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:07,890
If there's no...

2256
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,450
If there's no spot free.

2257
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:12,210
We see who is the 20th place team.

2258
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,930
And we land on them.

2259
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,090
That's us.

2260
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,310
No I meant overall.

2261
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:18,310
Overall.

2262
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,930
Is that fucked up?

2263
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,090
That's not fucked up right?

2264
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,870
Dude we are weak and we are playing on the weaker.

2265
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:27,670
That's fair as fuck.

2266
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:28,930
It's strategy.

2267
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:33,350
If people can do that in pro league and fuck over other teams.

2268
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,190
We can too.

2269
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,510
That's...

2270
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:39,630
There's no rules against doing that.

2271
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,990
Against sabotaging other teams.

2272
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:41,770
Yup.

2273
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,730
Okay so we just need to find out.

2274
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,950
Who is overall 20th place.

2275
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,090
And then take their...

2276
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,630
Then take their POI.

2277
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:50,830
I...

2278
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,070
I don't know if we can even be 20th place.

2279
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,490
There's no way.

2280
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,770
I think we are the 20th.

2281
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,810
In terms of gun skill.

2282
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:01,250
No no.

2283
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,750
I think we are the 10th place.

2284
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,970
There's one open POI.

2285
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:05,570
Turbine.

2286
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:06,910
Oh that's good.

2287
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:07,950
Turbine.

2288
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,270
Say turbine in chat please.

2289
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:12,370
Or guys.

2290
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,670
Or we can get 3 points.

2291
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,890
And land on the 20th team overall.

2292
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,330
But here's the thing.

2293
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,550
If we lose the 20th place team.

2294
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,870
What the fuck are we gonna do?

2295
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,410
Then we're the 20th place team.

2296
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:28,410
And then we become the 20th place team.

2297
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:31,690
Oh my gosh.

2298
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,530
Do you not believe in us?

2299
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,230
I believe in...

2300
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,570
Okay do you not believe in me?

2301
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,390
Let's not add tempo into the equation.

2302
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:39,830
No no I believe in you.

2303
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,970
You are a platform player.

2304
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,590
I'm pretty good for a platform player.

2305
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,810
You know if you think about it.

2306
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,250
For a platform player.

2307
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:50,070
I'm pretty good.

2308
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,050
If we get tempo not to die.

2309
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,210
We're good to go.

2310
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,370
That's true.

2311
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,990
Tempo got us 2 points last game.

2312
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,090
That's the thing.

2313
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:02,890
We need him to be alive to farm points for us.

2314
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,150
We just need a...

2315
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,450
I'm confused.

2316
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,770
You know why that happened?

2317
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:10,890
Because I was on Valk and I was like.

2318
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,510
I can fly and then I flew to the roof.

2319
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,130
This is what...

2320
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,690
If I was any other legend.

2321
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,870
I would not have been able to make it up on the roof.

2322
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:20,550
And I would be like.

2323
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:24,210
This is why you never listen to your heart.

2324
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:26,230
I was trying to be a good teammate.

2325
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:28,930
He was so excited to play Valk.

2326
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:29,730
I don't know what to say.

2327
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,230
To be a good teammate.

2328
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,650
You seemed like you were like.

2329
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:33,210
I want to play Valk.

2330
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:35,850
No because he wanted you to play Octane.

2331
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:40,010
Tempo was the one that was trying to be a good teammate.

2332
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,410
Realistically.

2333
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,590
Realistically we want to be honest here.

2334
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,370
Tempo should be playing the controller characters.

2335
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:46,550
Okay.

2336
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:47,490
Okay.

2337
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,750
I'll take all the controllers.

2338
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:52,950
Unless there is a fuse.

2339
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:54,050
Okay.

2340
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,990
Tell them not to add it.

2341
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,650
Put fuse in.

2342
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,810
Tell them to remove all fuses.

2343
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,050
From now on.

2344
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,570
Some of my chat says.

2345
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,150
You realize that Doki still has zero kills on cat.

2346
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:10,590
You still have zero kills on cat after that game.

2347
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,590
Zero kills on cat.

2348
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,510
Yeah dude.

2349
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,030
Keeping that tradition.

2350
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,090
Less than 100 kills on cat.

2351
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:20,430
We are so torched.

2352
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,870
Why are there so many teams alive still?

2353
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,030
I don't know.

2354
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:25,450
That's because we died pretty early.

2355
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,070
Yeah that's because.

2356
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,730
We didn't even get the Valk ulti that game.

2357
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,710
We didn't even get any ulti.

2358
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:35,350
Guys 20th place in my own tournament is crazy.

2359
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:35,790
Yeah.

2360
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:38,830
We have to get at least 19th in that game.

2361
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:39,310
We have to.

2362
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:40,230
Please.

2363
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,270
We are not improving.

2364
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:45,010
No one is contesting next game.

2365
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,150
Guys.

2366
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:47,390
That's good.

2367
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:50,630
That's already one thing we don't have to worry about.

2368
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:52,550
That's true.

2369
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:55,010
That also means no one is going to die to Nia.

2370
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,190
We should tell everybody.

2371
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,370
We should tell everybody what our skins are.

2372
01:12:58,450 --> 01:12:59,730
So they won't run at us.

2373
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,470
Then we will give them someone else's skin.

2374
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,030
That is so true.

2375
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,750
What is this team skins?

2376
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:08,590
Yellow bang.

2377
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,230
I am now a yellow bang.

2378
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,610
I will play yellow skins.

2379
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,590
Or bright pink.

2380
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,790
We are giving people wrong...

2381
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:15,790
Wait.

2382
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,010
What map are we playing on?

2383
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:21,010
We are giving people other people's skin colors.

2384
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,030
My mom in the chat said I am back.

2385
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:23,630
What is happening?

2386
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:24,870
Mom we just got 20th place.

2387
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:26,770
No you could have lied.

2388
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,230
Mom we got first.

2389
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,510
We got first last game.

2390
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:36,610
We were doing so well that EA staff told us to sit this one out.

2391
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,290
So other people can have a chance.

2392
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:39,850
We are watch partying from inside the game now.

2393
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,770
I want to say right now this is better than international scrims quality.

2394
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:44,410
14 teams alive on board.

2395
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,950
We have 14 teams alive after 12 seconds of the first game.

2396
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,730
People don't get money from scrims.

2397
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,870
Of course this is better.

2398
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:53,090
You are so right.

2399
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,590
Money changes everything.

2400
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:56,890
Even if they did.

2401
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,230
Not for us though.

2402
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,370
There is not change anything for us.

2403
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:02,750
We are literally content.

2404
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,630
No Temple you should start giving vouchers for your scrims.

2405
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,770
So people take it more seriously.

2406
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,630
Like a $5 coupon for something.

2407
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:14,270
A $5 coupon?

2408
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:19,110
We will gift you 5 subs if you survive.

2409
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,330
That's so true.

2410
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,290
That's so true.

2411
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,470
That's how we should do the payout.

2412
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:27,090
Yeah.

2413
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,730
Instead of 4 world placements.

2414
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:30,510
5.

2415
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,610
Pass round 3.

2416
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,510
For every round you survive.

2417
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:38,790
Your team earns extra money.

2418
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:40,610
Like I said.

2419
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,610
5 subs per person.

2420
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:44,990
That will be financed by WIG.

2421
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:46,830
Yeah.

2422
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,710
Make the bank account for everybody.

2423
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:53,290
But WIG will give you better quality scrims.

2424
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:53,970
Which means better.

2425
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:55,330
More viewers.

2426
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:57,210
More viewers in general.

2427
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,770
Which means more income in general.

2428
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,310
So in the end.

2429
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,050
You are going to gain money.

2430
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,970
You are so smart.

2431
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,990
Viewers would want to watch better scrims.

2432
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,390
Because the scrims will be longer too.

2433
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:10,890
Yeah.

2434
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:14,690
And then you can run as many ads as you want.

2435
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,550
Sorry guys.

2436
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:19,490
I'm going to run ads now.

2437
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,810
Doki has a fascination with me spending money.

2438
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:24,470
She is like.

2439
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:25,170
Listen.

2440
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:26,610
When Kempo gets these kills.

2441
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,670
You just drop like 600 bucks each.

2442
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:29,850
It's not that big of a deal.

2443
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,630
It's motivation.

2444
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,450
Money motivates people.

2445
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,290
It's true.

2446
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:35,550
Look at right now.

2447
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:38,290
Look at the quality of this tournament.

2448
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,710
It's the most motivated I've seen snipe down in a very long time.

2449
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,190
You.

2450
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:43,950
Whoa.

2451
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:46,990
Him not being relegated.

2452
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,590
Him being relegated probably didn't help.

2453
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:54,610
He's playing like he's 10 years younger right now.

2454
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:55,310
Oh yeah.

2455
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,110
And he dies.

2456
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,410
And he just died.

2457
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:03,790
And he gets beeped across the fucking map.

2458
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:04,150
Dude.

2459
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,490
You have to stay regulated.

2460
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,310
There is no fucking way.

2461
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:14,730
You just actually VTuber cursed him so hard.

2462
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:18,030
You're the one that mentioned his name first.

2463
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:18,910
What do you mean?

2464
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:23,390
I was talking about getting money motivation.

2465
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:24,350
But you're here.

2466
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:24,770
You're here.

2467
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,910
I'm here.

2468
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,110
I give the extra curse.

2469
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:28,050
Agreed.

2470
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,650
There's got to be something along with VTubers and curses.

2471
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:32,410
They don't make sense.

2472
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,130
No I think casters give a better curse than VTubers.

2473
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:38,370
I will agree that I definitely give a harder curse.

2474
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,610
Yeah.

2475
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:38,890
For sure.

2476
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,770
I agree with that one.

2477
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:42,690
Holy shit.

2478
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:43,370
This is a hard zone.

2479
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:44,250
I'm going to be honest guys.

2480
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,190
I'm kind of happy we died.

2481
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:46,930
What do you mean?

2482
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,850
You're happy that we died 20th?

2483
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:50,970
Yeah a little bit.

2484
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:55,010
We would have been on that house on the left side.

2485
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:56,650
We would have been on that house on the left side.

2486
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,710
We could have Valked over there and got the house.

2487
01:16:58,970 --> 01:16:59,890
That would have been us.

2488
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,710
I think the tempo is just a boss for that.

2489
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:03,970
I think the tempo is just a boss for that.

2490
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,010
Just sitting on top of a roof like that is crazy.

2491
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,610
Yeah with white armor.

2492
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,950
That was actually crazy.

2493
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:13,070
Like all confidence white armor.

2494
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,790
Did you not think you were on white armor?

2495
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:18,190
I don't think it would help.

2496
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:20,170
I mean I don't think it would help.

2497
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:21,350
He was dead regardless.

2498
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,310
If I had blue I would have been alive.

2499
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:29,150
You were literally dead and he still charged rightfully.

2500
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:31,350
Tempo your reaction time on that was crazy.

2501
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,770
How do you know?

2502
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:33,870
You didn't see anything.

2503
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:37,390
I looked up and you were still in the same spot.

2504
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:40,290
I looked up and you were still in the same spot.

2505
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,930
You were still standing still when you were getting shot.

2506
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:43,310
What do you mean?

2507
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:45,650
I don't know what you are talking about.

2508
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,510
I'm talking about you Tempo.

2509
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:48,130
Jersey is off.

2510
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:52,870
Are you taking off your shirt right now?

2511
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,290
I'm ready.

2512
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:01,670
The day I stop playing is the day Tempo plays in a tournament shirtless.

2513
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:04,770
He is shirtless right now.

2514
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:07,250
Look at this.

2515
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,450
Is that Toss?

2516
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,810
Can you play with your titty's out?

2517
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:14,190
No it feels like...

2518
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,390
You know those like nipple stickers?

2519
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:17,930
That they...

2520
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:21,270
On Twitch people who do it on Twitch for body paint.

2521
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:22,130
Pasties.

2522
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,810
How do you know the name of that?

2523
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:26,410
I've been doing it.

2524
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:27,410
I've been knowing things.

2525
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,150
How do you know their names?

2526
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,790
I used to watch makeup tutorials when I was younger.

2527
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:32,690
Really?

2528
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,390
Yeah I was interested in makeup for a while.

2529
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,250
Oh shit.

2530
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:39,130
Do you wear pasties on your nips?

2531
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,150
No I do not wear pasties.

2532
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,110
Why not?

2533
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:45,950
I'm fucking naked bro.

2534
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:48,230
Bro but you had a fascination.

2535
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,590
No I was just interested with makeup.

2536
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,050
I was like oh these people are good at it.

2537
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:53,370
Wait how many...

2538
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,050
Okay if you put that as a...

2539
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:57,210
As a goal.

2540
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,210
What to wear pasties on street?

2541
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:06,670
There is not a single goal that would get me shirtless with nipple tassels.

2542
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:06,850
There is not a single goal that would get me shirtless with nipple tassels.

2543
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:07,710
I don't know how to fucking feel.

2544
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:12,370
No not like tassels but like just cover it as if you have no nipples.

2545
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:15,510
I would actually rather have tassels than any of those you know.

2546
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:16,870
Than no nipples?

2547
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,610
Wait wait why would you not want to be nippleless?

2548
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,890
I don't want to see what I look like like that.

2549
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:28,370
I don't want to see what I look like like that.

2550
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,590
Oh my god someone said you can make them spin.

2551
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:32,130
That's what I'm saying.

2552
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:33,370
Alright we're back.

2553
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,230
What do you mean we're back?

2554
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:36,730
We've been here the whole time.

2555
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,470
We've been here the whole time.

2556
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:41,510
I want to go grab some stuff.

2557
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:44,270
Wait are you actually shirtless right now?

2558
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,690
No.

2559
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,410
Bro no balls.

2560
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,850
No balls is crazy.

2561
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:50,550
No.

2562
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:53,770
Hey wait if...

2563
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:55,090
Oh no he's dead.

2564
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,530
Oh god who's winning just tell me who is winning.

2565
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,670
Well not Drops team.

2566
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:02,370
We just saw him got mowed down there.

2567
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:03,290
He got rocked.

2568
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,210
We gotta make sure I'm anonymous next game.

2569
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:06,190
Bye.

2570
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:08,150
This is more fun.

2571
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,490
Yeah it is.

2572
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:12,750
Of course you did.

2573
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:13,990
Of course.

2574
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,010
Wait so you wouldn't...

2575
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,010
You wouldn't wear...

2576
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:20,690
Why wouldn't you wear Pacey's?

2577
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,170
Why are you afraid of being like nippleless?

2578
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:26,710
I don't understand Wig.

2579
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,170
I just don't want to see what I look like without...

2580
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,050
I don't know I'm just...

2581
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,010
I'm down but I'm trying to do it on stream.

2582
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,890
I'm trying to be like...

2583
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,670
No nipples on stream.

2584
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,110
I'm not even trying to show my nipples on stream.

2585
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:40,830
But it's not against TOS.

2586
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:43,450
No I like fully understand it's not against TOS.

2587
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:45,330
It's just like I'm not trying to show my nipples.

2588
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:47,630
But you won't be showing it.

2589
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:48,510
Because it won't be seen.

2590
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,310
Drops why...

2591
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:54,730
Bro why did you do that to poor tempo?

2592
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:57,430
Man was scoped in...

2593
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,930
499, 9 times...

2594
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,270
Charge Rifling.

2595
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,270
Bro people...

2596
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,410
Your chat wants it.

2597
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,850
They want that content.

2598
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,770
Of course my chat wants it.

2599
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:08,990
They see me as a piece of meat.

2600
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:13,790
I bend over to turn my Christmas tree on and it's just non-stop fucking comments.

2601
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:15,590
Wait is that why you have a Christmas tree on?

2602
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:17,130
So you can make an excuse to bend over?

2603
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,030
No I should get a whiteboard though.

2604
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,210
Oh you should.

2605
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,230
Every time like...

2606
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:24,770
You use it to put the scores down for scrims.

2607
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,190
So every time you're like...

2608
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,210
Oh this team won.

2609
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:27,970
You can bend...

2610
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,250
You can turn it around.

2611
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:31,450
Oh look at these winners.

2612
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,830
Look at all these scrim winners.

2613
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:37,630
That's content right there.

2614
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,210
That is 100% content.

2615
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,050
I'm asking Drop how bad your reaction time was.

2616
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,010
Yo the game doesn't count okay?

2617
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:47,370
Because anonymous zone was supposed to happen but it didn't.

2618
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,250
So the whole game is...

2619
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,070
Oh my god yes.

2620
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:54,910
Tell them right now.

2621
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:57,250
If pro league can do that we can too.

2622
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,730
It's your tournament.

2623
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,070
The game doesn't count because anonymous mode was not on.

2624
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,550
Yeah.

2625
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:04,330
Wait tell them that right now.

2626
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:06,130
Alrighty.

2627
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,630
What am I telling them?

2628
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:12,210
Tell them that because anonymous mode was not on when you told them to tell them on.

2629
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:12,690
It doesn't count.

2630
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:13,410
It doesn't count.

2631
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:14,410
This game is wiped off.

2632
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:15,510
For sure.

2633
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:19,810
I think they're totally going to listen to me after they've paid for everyone to be there for a certain amount of hours.

2634
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,470
No I'll just...

2635
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,130
I mean obviously I think Doki's right.

2636
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:24,890
I'll just put another...

2637
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,010
I'll put like $20,000 of my own money into this.

2638
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:27,610
Exactly.

2639
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:28,990
Yeah exactly.

2640
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,590
And then you can make it back by having a whiteboard.

2641
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,470
All you need to do is run one ad.

2642
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,310
You're a genius.

2643
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:33,810
You're a genius.

2644
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,390
One ad and you break even.

2645
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:37,410
One ad $20,000.

2646
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,390
You're like maybe two ads.

2647
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,590
New legends.

2648
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,070
Maybe two ads.

2649
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:44,930
Ash Bullish.

2650
01:22:45,170 --> 01:22:45,970
Top Finder.

2651
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,010
Crypto Vantage.

2652
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:47,950
Caustic Lifeline.

2653
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:48,970
Art Machine.

2654
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,330
Obviously Tempo's Caustic.

2655
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:52,390
Alright.

2656
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:54,730
We're on...

2657
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,250
Oh Olympus.

2658
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:56,790
Olympus.

2659
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,870
Yeah.

2660
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,150
I need a white.

2661
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,370
Alright.

2662
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:04,190
I mean to be fair the other ones are just whatever you're comfortable with Doki.

2663
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:06,970
I'm down with anything.

2664
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,130
Honestly.

2665
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:11,510
I mean we could do Lifeline just to crack people if Tempo dies.

2666
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:13,170
I mean we could do Lifeline just to crack people if Tempo dies.

2667
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,370
Or wait no actually if Wig dies.

2668
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:17,470
Because you're the...

2669
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,610
You're gonna be taking most of the hits.

2670
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:25,190
I should probably play Path for rotational purposes.

2671
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,630
I'll play Path for our rotations.

2672
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:28,910
Zip lines and stuff.

2673
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,550
I'll play Lifeline for the crafter.

2674
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:31,570
Okay.

2675
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,210
You cool with that?

2676
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:34,090
Yeah I'm cool with that.

2677
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:36,770
Alright let me change my skin and badges.

2678
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,410
We're so locked in guys.

2679
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,950
We're gonna get a beacon and turbine.

2680
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:42,090
Cause this map...

2681
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,470
Does not have a beacon.

2682
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:45,930
Alright.

2683
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,590
Okay Lifeline.

2684
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,710
No I need therapy after Tempo today.

2685
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:52,810
That's my dog.

2686
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:54,090
Alright.

2687
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:55,170
I went to therapy once.

2688
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:56,390
I did too.

2689
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:57,290
Only once?

2690
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,770
Yeah it's way more.

2691
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,470
Both of you guys should go more than once.

2692
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,270
Cause you went once of course it didn't work out.

2693
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,950
It was never gonna work out.

2694
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:06,890
You don't know that.

2695
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:08,190
You need to find the right therapist.

2696
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:11,530
And the issues are impossible.

2697
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,350
Woah.

2698
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:14,590
What issues?

2699
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:15,690
Issues are impossible.

2700
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,410
Okay you know what Tempo?

2701
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:19,730
Trauma dump on us right now.

2702
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:21,890
You're a sociopath.

2703
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:23,910
Wait really?

2704
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,850
Okay I was gonna feel like...

2705
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:31,690
Holy shit.

2706
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,550
And you were a teacher.

2707
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,390
I was gonna move around children.

2708
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:39,530
You think sweet comes with a turbine just to go with it?

2709
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:39,890
No wait.

2710
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,430
That's why I was...

2711
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:42,230
That's why I...

2712
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:42,630
Wait.

2713
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,570
Teacher thing turned me into one.

2714
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:46,330
That's the way.

2715
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:46,770
No again.

2716
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:49,230
Children can't turn you into a sociopath.

2717
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:50,370
You're...

2718
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,130
What is the 340...

2719
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,910
If we get contested at...

2720
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,950
If we get contested at turbine we're so choked guys.

2721
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,470
Wait.

2722
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,070
So we'll late drop turbine?

2723
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:02,890
Cause if someone tries to contest us turbine it means another POI is open.

2724
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,930
Cause there's one team...

2725
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:07,070
Yeah there's one team per POI right now.

2726
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,690
Okay.

2727
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:10,510
We'll just late drop and if someone contests us...

2728
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,690
We'll destroy a 2009 their PC.

2729
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,100
Alright.

2730
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,040
No one's doing turbine I don't think.

2731
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,200
There's no one doing turbine.

2732
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,060
Yeah so we're fine.

2733
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,160
If someone swerves.

2734
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,200
Yeah.

2735
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:28,680
Guys.

2736
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,360
Guys we...wait.

2737
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:30,860
Guys.

2738
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,340
We should make a team paranoid.

2739
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,500
Who's like the 20th team overall?

2740
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,800
And what is the POI?

2741
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,860
We'll just pretend we're going somewhere else.

2742
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,680
Are we 20th?

2743
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,240
Yeah yeah yeah.

2744
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:39,660
No no no.

2745
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,660
I wanna make a team...

2746
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,640
I wanna make a team paranoid by saying we're landing on their POI.

2747
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,200
So you think they're getting contested.

2748
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,260
Who's last right now?

2749
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:49,940
No wait.

2750
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,020
No that's 5 head cause then someone will try and kill us off drop and then...

2751
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:54,640
Yeah that's why.

2752
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,780
And then there's three teams.

2753
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:56,300
Exactly.

2754
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,500
And then they'll really be contesting the other team.

2755
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,660
Yeah that's why I'm big braining this right now.

2756
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,580
Who's the 20th team and what's the POI?

2757
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:04,540
I'm looking at the leaderboard.

2758
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,660
I mean I'm waiting for the leaderboard to get updated.

2759
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:08,840
Hawaii.

2760
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,140
Website.

2761
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,240
Guys I'm gonna be honest.

2762
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,380
Can I say a statement that we might not like here?

2763
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:15,840
Okay.

2764
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,640
Wait what is it?

2765
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:24,060
I did not believe in us for Challenger Circuit at all.

2766
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,180
And I'm gonna be honest.

2767
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:27,340
Oh thank god you said that.

2768
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,660
Wait a minute.

2769
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,720
I still don't believe in us less.

2770
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,240
Wait a minute.

2771
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,600
I'm glad you said it.

2772
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,920
Because I don't.

2773
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,120
We're gonna be going against...

2774
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,500
We're against makeshift teams right now.

2775
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:43,980
Okay.

2776
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,200
When we go to Challengers we're gonna be against teams that have been playing together for a little bit.

2777
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,020
Yeah and that's why.

2778
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,800
We've been scrimming and everything.

2779
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:54,600
But people who are playing on a touchpad that have been playing together are still not gonna be able to hit anything.

2780
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,380
So you think these people are playing on iPads in Challengers?

2781
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,580
They're on the Switch.

2782
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,940
They joined the Challengers.

2783
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:01,440
Oh no no.

2784
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:05,020
Not that they're actually playing on a Switch.

2785
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,840
But they might as well be playing on a Switch.

2786
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,400
They can't hit anything.

2787
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,280
Oh I see.

2788
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,240
Yeah yeah yeah.

2789
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,740
They're uploading the scores right now.

2790
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:15,680
Where?

2791
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,500
I think we're last.

2792
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,180
I think we're last.

2793
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:18,880
That's so sad.

2794
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,180
We have four points.

2795
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:20,780
We have to be last.

2796
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,820
Don't say that.

2797
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:25,400
There's like ten teams below us.

2798
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,320
If you find the scores over here.

2799
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,440
I already looked.

2800
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,100
Please select final results.

2801
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,720
Don't say that.

2802
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,280
There has to be a team.

2803
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:34,600
Team more?

2804
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,280
Team more buts.

2805
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,520
It's not updated yet.

2806
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,220
They haven't uploaded the score.

2807
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,820
Okay let's just look at the current last place team.

2808
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,360
And say their POI.

2809
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,700
Oh final results.

2810
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,160
I see.

2811
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:47,440
Yeah yeah.

2812
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:48,540
It's not uploaded.

2813
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,340
How the fuck?

2814
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,120
Timmy is last place right now.

2815
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,120
Yeah we're in ninth.

2816
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,940
No not yet.

2817
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,060
That's round one.

2818
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:56,940
That's round one.

2819
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,280
There's three teams with zero points.

2820
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:02,240
It's Timmy, WeThePeople, and Kian.

2821
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:04,380
Okay.

2822
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,060
Yeah yeah yeah.

2823
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,780
Where are they landing?

2824
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,900
I'm going to look at where they're landing.

2825
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:10,460
Timmy was landing phase.

2826
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,500
Kian's team is really good.

2827
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,360
I'm not trying to land on them.

2828
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,220
Who's Kian's team?

2829
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:16,100
Terminal.

2830
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:16,540
Him and Khan.

2831
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:17,460
Him and Khan.

2832
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,920
Is Terminal on...

2833
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,200
Is Terminal the third map?

2834
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:22,540
Wait what's their third map?

2835
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,960
Terminal the third map, Donkey?

2836
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,860
I know this is the drop spot.

2837
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,320
She's more confused than I am.

2838
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,040
We're playing Olympus, Donkey.

2839
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,660
I was going to say is Terminal in Olympus?

2840
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,960
Okay we're landing in Terminal.

2841
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,420
I was going to say we're landing in Terminal.

2842
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,060
What if they land on Turbine now?

2843
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,280
Thinking we're going Terminal.

2844
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:43,900
No they won't.

2845
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,080
Then we go Terminal.

2846
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,220
I said we're landing Terminal.

2847
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,460
There's no way.

2848
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:49,300
There's no way.

2849
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,560
If they do that we're fucked.

2850
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:52,780
There's no way.

2851
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:53,740
They're the last place.

2852
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,680
Oh wait they have Kai.

2853
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:55,260
Never mind.

2854
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:55,740
I'm scared.

2855
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,980
They have Control.

2856
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,400
I'm the last place.

2857
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,560
We just got back to Usu.

2858
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,600
I have no idea how they're last.

2859
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,840
They're good.

2860
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,080
Wait they're not.

2861
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,580
It's not updated yet though.

2862
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,540
And they have a Control player too.

2863
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,740
No no no.

2864
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,160
They're staying.

2865
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:10,840
They're staying Terminal.

2866
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,000
They're staying.

2867
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,260
And you die to us in Terminal.

2868
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:16,780
And you die to us in Terminal.

2869
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:17,020
Law.

2870
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:23,980
I'm just...

2871
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:26,220
I'm baiting him.

2872
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,860
I'm baiting him right now.

2873
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,300
Okay.

2874
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,020
So hopefully Sweet goes over there.

2875
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:32,920
And kills Kai.

2876
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,780
And then we'll get 19.

2877
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,080
We're so fucked.

2878
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:40,820
I'm landing on you.

2879
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:41,240
Hey Wig great.

2880
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,240
Peep just decent.

2881
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:44,860
Dude, the game.

2882
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:46,460
No, no, no.

2883
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,420
Sorry, sorry.

2884
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,300
Bro, what a...

2885
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,100
You're such a snitch, Wig.

2886
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,560
Wig the vibes were high until Tempo got his head taken off.

2887
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,660
I rewatched.

2888
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,160
Rewatched what?

2889
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,340
He rewatched the fucking clip.

2890
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,820
He re-hacked a 20-second clip.

2891
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,720
10 seconds after?

2892
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,020
Bro, what the fuck, Devo?

2893
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,960
How do you react twice?

2894
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,600
It wasn't 20 seconds, okay?

2895
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:20,980
It was like 10.

2896
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,940
How does that make it better?

2897
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,960
10 seconds makes this better.

2898
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,060
That is very fast.

2899
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,280
10 seconds reaction time.

2900
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,980
Did you have a 6 times or a 4 to 8?

2901
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,460
I got a 6.

2902
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,900
Yeah, 6.

2903
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:40,820
It's not my fault.

2904
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:41,500
It's a 6x.

2905
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,120
It's not my fault.

2906
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:45,400
Yeah, it's a scope.

2907
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,780
Guys, it's not his fault, guys.

2908
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,580
Don't worry, we'll make it back.

2909
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,620
Alright, let's get to 15 points.

2910
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,180
So we need what, 11?

2911
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,600
11 is so doable, guys.

2912
01:30:58,780 --> 01:30:59,620
11 points?

2913
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,760
We need 6 kills in fourth place.

2914
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:04,900
Yeah, yeah.

2915
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,440
We need a beacon and we need a shield.

2916
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,120
We need an evac tower.

2917
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,220
I had an evac tower, too!

2918
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:11,660
You did?

2919
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:13,160
Yeah, I told you guys!

2920
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:16,340
I know, but we got stuck on command, bro.

2921
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:20,400
How did they get into command if we went in the middle?

2922
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,960
Because they went frontside.

2923
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:25,640
I think they thought that no one was there, so they just went in the front.

2924
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:27,020
Because we went through the butthole.

2925
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:27,700
Yeah.

2926
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:30,840
They might not come back next one.

2927
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,480
Oh, right, we're playing there again.

2928
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,980
Wait, we have somebody missing on the far right.

2929
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:40,760
Wait, that means that I can see where in Stormpoint is it.

2930
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,640
Who said that sucks, Star?

2931
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,960
I just got jury duty, have fun, man.

2932
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,780
Are you supposed to go to jury duty, like, yearly?

2933
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,620
No, you can pretend.

2934
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,020
You get RNG'd for jury duty.

2935
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,900
Yeah, you get RNG'd for jury duty and then you can tell them that you're not competent enough to be a...

2936
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,520
Yeah, just say you're stupid and...

2937
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,480
I would do that 100%.

2938
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:04,780
Okay.

2939
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:05,560
Just be like...

2940
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,720
What if you could, like, put on, like, a really crazy intense big case?

2941
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,420
That would be scary.

2942
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,020
That's why you don't take the case.

2943
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,740
No, no, that's why you take it.

2944
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,900
That's why you take it and then you manipulate everyone.

2945
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:19,280
No, okay, here's how to get out of, like, jury duty.

2946
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:23,260
Okay, as a... not an American, but, like, this is how you get out...

2947
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2948
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:25,780
Pathfinder?

2949
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,420
Yeah.

2950
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:27,000
You're playing...

2951
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,320
Lifeline.

2952
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:28,580
Plastic.

2953
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,100
What are you playing?

2954
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,060
Plastic.

2955
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,080
Wait, can we do prison?

2956
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:32,580
UPDATED!

2957
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,860
In Canada what?

2958
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:35,440
You gotta say something.

2959
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:43,180
Okay, as I was saying, like, to get out of jury duty, if it's, like, something that's, like, a really high prolific case, you can be like, I sympathize with the murderer.

2960
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,760
And then you're... you already have, like, a bias towards the...

2961
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,960
And then they're like, oh, I guess we can't have you.

2962
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,080
Yeah, because you have... to be in jury duty, you have to have no biases at all.

2963
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,660
So you can... you can just be like, I don't know, I think he could be... I think he was a nice guy before...

2964
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:58,980
I think he's a nice guy.

2965
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,700
So you get out of jury duty.

2966
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,040
I'm not doing jury duty.

2967
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,900
Why don't you just say that to the victims instead?

2968
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,280
Like, I sympathize with them.

2969
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:14,060
Well, you don't say it to the victims, you say it to the judge, because they're picking the people who are doing jury duty.

2970
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,340
You know, you're not a bad...

2971
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:19,660
Yeah, so they won't know you said that, you know?

2972
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,100
The victims won't know.

2973
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:21,540
True.

2974
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,520
You're spitting.

2975
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,640
Only the judge will know.

2976
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,020
And then they'll be like, we can't put you in jury duty because you already have a bias towards the murderer.

2977
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,060
I don't think you have to worry at all, Doki.

2978
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:32,860
I don't think you're ever getting picked based off these statements you said.

2979
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,260
Never.

2980
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:35,500
They're watching.

2981
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:36,700
They're watching you now.

2982
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,600
Take this seriously and show us LG wig?

2983
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:40,460
What do you mean take this seriously?

2984
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:40,800
That is a joke, guys.

2985
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:41,940
This is a joke.

2986
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:43,760
It's not a joke.

2987
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:44,080
Get her.

2988
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,100
It's a joke.

2989
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,260
It was a joke, guys.

2990
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,400
For legal reasons, this is a joke.

2991
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,080
No, for legal reasons, she's being serious.

2992
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:50,460
Get her.

2993
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,520
Do not take my advice.

2994
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,440
Minus tempo on caustic.

2995
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,140
Wait, we don't have to peek in again.

2996
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,420
I'm gonna fucking cry.

2997
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:58,680
Again?

2998
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,660
I might cry.

2999
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,100
I might cry.

3000
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:00,480
I might cry.

3001
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:03,040
Just jump right now before someone just jumps.

3002
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:03,720
Tempo jump, please.

3003
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,740
Before somebody tries to take the- Why am I jumping?

3004
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,520
Before somebody takes Turbine from us.

3005
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:11,140
Yeah, please.

3006
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,380
We need something in this world.

3007
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:12,660
Yeah.

3008
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:15,860
How do we not have a fucking peek in again?

3009
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,240
This game actually wants me to go laugh about this question.

3010
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,840
Guys, I don't wanna be bottom five, guys.

3011
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:25,400
What did you just say?

3012
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,840
I don't wanna be bottom five, guys.

3013
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,260
No, that's gonna sell.

3014
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,720
No, that shit is gone.

3015
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,620
What are you talking about?

3016
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,140
We are bottom five.

3017
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:34,860
Bottom five for sure.

3018
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:35,700
No.

3019
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:37,420
No.

3020
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,500
What happened?

3021
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,660
We used to be so good at this game.

3022
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:46,200
What happened to- We were supposed to do challenger circuits.

3023
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:47,980
You are still doing it.

3024
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,200
Yes, but if- I don't know.

3025
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,780
I don't have high hopes anymore.

3026
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,700
I never had high hopes to begin with.

3027
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:56,660
I can't believe you said that actually.

3028
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,440
I'm like lowkey impressed that you said that.

3029
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,100
Hey, tempo.

3030
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,080
Please.

3031
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,340
Just do that.

3032
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:02,520
Boing.

3033
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,220
I got- I pinged it too.

3034
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,660
Oh my god.

3035
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,040
Wait, I have the perfect excuse.

3036
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,840
I'm categorized as platform.

3037
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,400
You guys should have been carrying me.

3038
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,920
Of course, yeah.

3039
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:16,300
I know.

3040
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,480
You guys should have been carrying me.

3041
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:19,180
This is so embarrassing.

3042
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:19,580
Hey guys, I'm ready.

3043
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:20,820
Hey, tempo.

3044
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:23,380
Based on the zone- I mean, not that- I mean, no offense.

3045
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,720
Where do you think this is going?

3046
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,740
I mean, he should know because he watches so many scrims.

3047
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:28,720
Yeah, Wig.

3048
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:29,860
You should know because you watch so many scrims.

3049
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:31,440
Okay, both of you guys should know.

3050
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,200
Both of us should know.

3051
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:32,760
Both of us should fucking shit.

3052
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:33,300
That's what I'm saying.

3053
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,960
Yeah, why just me?

3054
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:35,740
I'm asleep.

3055
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:37,460
That's true actually.

3056
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:38,200
That's true, yeah.

3057
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,920
I mean, I wanna go into energy depot but there's a team there.

3058
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,140
We should just keep walking up towards this.

3059
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,480
Okay, I'm following wing.

3060
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,060
You make the yellow dots and I just follow.

3061
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:46,680
Okay.

3062
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:47,260
Yeah.

3063
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,040
Let's start a moving.

3064
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,640
I have no idea where the zones are going.

3065
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:50,340
God.

3066
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:53,720
Now I know why no one picked a turbine.

3067
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,040
This loot sucks.

3068
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,100
Honestly, my loot's pretty good.

3069
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,020
We got scammed by a cerca beacon.

3070
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:58,860
Hammond, that's fine.

3071
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,240
That's fine.

3072
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,480
Oh, they're far, they're far.

3073
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:01,520
Yeah, far, far.

3074
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,160
We're good.

3075
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,760
That was pretty dog shit.

3076
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,000
I have no attachments on anything.

3077
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:05,640
Or bats.

3078
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,260
I'm gonna get a bat right now though.

3079
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,060
I'm not great, I'll be honest.

3080
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,260
So you lied?

3081
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,460
I'm not BAT.

3082
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,260
So you lied?

3083
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,640
You literally said your...

3084
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,740
Did I say I was good?

3085
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,100
You said your loot was pretty good.

3086
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,240
Let's go this way.

3087
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,620
We gotta move out.

3088
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,040
Oh my god, I fucking need that.

3089
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:25,460
Fuck me.

3090
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,720
Just pick it up, pick it up.

3091
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,020
Oh, oh, oh.

3092
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,880
Just go up there.

3093
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,300
Tempo, you go up there first.

3094
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,820
And just watch out.

3095
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,340
Wait, they're fighting behind us.

3096
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:37,240
Come back here, come back here.

3097
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,200
Get in front of me.

3098
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,520
Kill him.

3099
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:42,640
Where?

3100
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,940
Okay, okay, I'm turning around.

3101
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:47,960
We got a point.

3102
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:48,340
We got a point.

3103
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:49,900
It's time to leave.

3104
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,740
We're not last.

3105
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:52,840
Wait, they scanned us.

3106
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,460
We shouldn't be there.

3107
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,580
Go back down, go back down.

3108
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,020
They scanned us.

3109
01:36:59,140 --> 01:36:59,380
They can't see us.

3110
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,560
Wait, wait, wait.

3111
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:01,440
We gotta wait for my zip line.

3112
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:03,360
We're gonna go across the small building over here.

3113
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,140
Come here, come here, come here.

3114
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,200
Take this.

3115
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:07,820
We're not gonna die.

3116
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,040
Okay, I didn't hesitate.

3117
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,200
I didn't hesitate this time.

3118
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:11,280
Good.

3119
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:11,760
Nice.

3120
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:12,220
Revalid.

3121
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:12,600
See, we're good.

3122
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:13,200
We're gonna play here.

3123
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:13,960
We're gonna play here for right now.

3124
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,320
Don't stand on the roof!

3125
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,500
Tempo, tempo.

3126
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:18,340
No roof action.

3127
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:18,900
Okay.

3128
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,040
There's a 4x...

3129
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:20,920
Oh wait, I need that actually.

3130
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,920
He's a 2x4 for me.

3131
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:23,800
Oh wait, this is nice.

3132
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,060
I'm dropping a 2x.

3133
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:27,920
Okay, I don't need it.

3134
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:28,160
We're good.

3135
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,700
There's a lot of people rotating in over here.

3136
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,360
I'm just don't know where this is going.

3137
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,060
42 damage and a kill.

3138
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,160
Guys, we're not last.

3139
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:37,180
We're 19th.

3140
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:37,940
And we got a point.

3141
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,860
That's like one point right now.

3142
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,220
Tempo, this is gonna be for you.

3143
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,140
Okay, Tempo.

3144
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,400
We need you to get us blue armor.

3145
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,800
Why is no one getting this care package?

3146
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,440
Did you scan the care package already?

3147
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,680
I did, yeah.

3148
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,040
They got it.

3149
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:53,340
They got it.

3150
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:54,500
It's fine.

3151
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:56,840
Here's where it is.

3152
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,480
We're doing it.

3153
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,220
I'm so proud of all of us.

3154
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,380
Oh my god.

3155
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:07,300
You don't need a heal Tempo.

3156
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,140
I will give you one little...

3157
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,380
one little heal.

3158
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:13,660
Great talk.

3159
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,940
We're not wasting meds.

3160
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,420
Alright, we're good.

3161
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:19,740
We're good.

3162
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,400
We'll make a play.

3163
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:21,880
We'll make a play.

3164
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,480
I got the They're over here.

3165
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,700
There's a lot of people rotating towards us.

3166
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:29,000
That's why I'm confusing where the zone is going.

3167
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:30,560
I'm scared.

3168
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,620
What if they come to us from behind?

3169
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:33,920
No, we're fine.

3170
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,580
Tempo, do you want to put some traps out here buddy?

3171
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:39,520
Yeah, so we know they walk up on us.

3172
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:40,580
Yeah, exactly.

3173
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:42,360
Oh my god, we're so smart.

3174
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,320
You're getting it.

3175
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:43,860
You're getting it.

3176
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,140
We're getting there.

3177
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,740
We're figuring this out.

3178
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,460
I don't see anybody yet.

3179
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:54,440
I hope they kill more people.

3180
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,260
So we can be 18th place.

3181
01:38:58,640 --> 01:38:59,700
It should be on the real list.

3182
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,100
It sounds so much better than 20th.

3183
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:01,520
It's insane.

3184
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,120
Yeah, I know.

3185
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,040
For some reason, 18th place sounds a lot better than being 26th.

3186
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,240
18th place sounds fantastic.

3187
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:08,080
I'll take 18th place all day.

3188
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:08,940
I know.

3189
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,180
I'm not using this two times if no one wants it.

3190
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:13,600
I have a 2x4.

3191
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,160
I don't need it.

3192
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:15,260
Okay.

3193
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,960
I should be coming from this side, right?

3194
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:20,900
I'm not picking anything.

3195
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:21,640
I'm so sorry.

3196
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:23,420
I don't know where to go.

3197
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,480
We have redeploy.

3198
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:25,940
We don't.

3199
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:26,320
We have...

3200
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,360
I have a Moby.

3201
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,180
We don't have redeploy.

3202
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:30,960
I do have a zipline.

3203
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,660
So efficiency.

3204
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,480
Did you make this work?

3205
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:35,660
18th place!

3206
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:36,300
18th place!

3207
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:37,040
Let's go!

3208
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:38,840
Green War for another team.

3209
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:41,460
If it goes towards garden, I rotate the river.

3210
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:41,900
There is still a guy here.

3211
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:43,740
There is?

3212
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,480
Oh, I see him.

3213
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,880
Probably out below.

3214
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:46,920
Green Pathfinder.

3215
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:47,860
That might be out.

3216
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:48,840
To be honest.

3217
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:49,440
Okay.

3218
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:52,200
Someone type in this chat right now to not push us.

3219
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,940
I'm so real for that.

3220
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,080
Max, stay still.

3221
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,460
Can we get some collision going?

3222
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,160
Can we get some collision going so I never...

3223
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:00,200
I mean, let me...

3224
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,940
There's no rules in Twitch Rivals about colluding.

3225
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,620
They never said no colluding.

3226
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,360
They did not say it.

3227
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3228
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,120
Let's see how bad my zone call was, yeah?

3229
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:11,980
Let's see.

3230
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:12,960
We got scanned.

3231
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,200
What were you even looking for?

3232
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:15,420
We got surveyed over here.

3233
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:16,520
I don't know.

3234
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,300
Feel free to roast, though.

3235
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:17,860
Let's see how it goes.

3236
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,300
Guys, for legal reasons, that's a joke, guys.

3237
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,640
Do not go to this chat.

3238
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,400
Do not go to this chat.

3239
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,840
Do not actually go to this chat.

3240
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,100
Because I think he'll actually push us now that he knows we're there.

3241
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:29,120
So do not go to this chat.

3242
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:29,380
All right.

3243
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:29,840
We got to go Rift.

3244
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,180
We got to go Rift.

3245
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,040
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

3246
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:31,560
Okay.

3247
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,160
And then just a whole team just flew in.

3248
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,780
We're so chonked.

3249
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,120
Oh, no.

3250
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,900
A whole team just flew in this building.

3251
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:39,940
And this building crashed.

3252
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,200
Take the zip and go there.

3253
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:42,480
I want to go next if we can.

3254
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:43,920
You say we can get out.

3255
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,620
I'm going to put a zip line down.

3256
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,000
Come here, come here.

3257
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:45,780
All right.

3258
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:47,680
Oh, there's a team here.

3259
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:48,280
Fuck me.

3260
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,060
Go back, go back, go back.

3261
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:49,460
We can't go this way.

3262
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:49,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3263
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:50,620
Go back, go back, go back.

3264
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3265
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,820
We literally can't go this way.

3266
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,420
Dude, this is...

3267
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:54,460
How do we not have a...

3268
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,980
I have a...

3269
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:58,440
I'm going to drop down my lifeline package.

3270
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:00,220
How do we not have a lifeline package?

3271
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,220
Maybe we'll get something here.

3272
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:02,760
Okay.

3273
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:03,480
You guys stay here.

3274
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,180
Yeah, yeah.

3275
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:04,900
You guys are going to get loot.

3276
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:05,740
Get EvoCache yourselves.

3277
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:06,140
Yeah.

3278
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,160
I'm going to go check up on Energy Depot until we get rotated.

3279
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:08,980
Just stay down here.

3280
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:09,480
One second.

3281
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:14,240
Are we going to get on that or no?

3282
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:14,540
Nope.

3283
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,200
There was nothing.

3284
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,380
There was a purple heavy mag.

3285
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,060
Yeah.

3286
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,820
Wait, there's people behind us.

3287
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:23,820
Wait, where are you?

3288
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:24,680
Where are you?

3289
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,020
Behind us.

3290
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:25,420
You're watching guys.

3291
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:25,640
Yeah, yeah.

3292
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:26,700
Come with me.

3293
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,040
Come with me.

3294
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:27,460
Come with me.

3295
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:27,700
Come with me.

3296
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:27,720
Come with me.

3297
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:28,540
Tembo, keep running.

3298
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:28,760
Keep running.

3299
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:29,220
I'm looking over you, buddy.

3300
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:29,580
Keep running.

3301
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:30,660
No.

3302
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:31,600
No.

3303
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,520
Why me?

3304
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,460
Why is it me?

3305
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:36,160
I'm dead too.

3306
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:36,540
Fuck.

3307
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,440
It's time to go.

3308
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,160
It's time to go.

3309
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,180
Run, run, run.

3310
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,200
You can craft us.

3311
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,240
You can craft us.

3312
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,920
This is exactly why I went lifeline.

3313
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:44,820
This is exactly why.

3314
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:45,560
How does that happen?

3315
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:46,820
How do we get walked up on?

3316
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,100
I'm getting shagged on?

3317
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:49,240
I'm dead.

3318
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,020
Bro, this is...

3319
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,540
What the fuck is this, man?

3320
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,000
Bro, when are we going to get a fucking evac?

3321
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:02,140
We haven't got one evac and we haven't got a fucking beacon.

3322
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,260
Hey, wait, wait.

3323
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,040
We got to kill them.

3324
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,300
So it's not a zero.

3325
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,560
We got one point.

3326
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:07,080
No, one kill.

3327
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,140
We got one point.

3328
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:08,540
Bro, what?

3329
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,800
Bro, not a single evac.

3330
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:13,960
Not a single beacon.

3331
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,900
I'm going to lose it.

3332
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:19,960
I literally did not hear anything for the team that walked up on us, to be fair.

3333
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,000
To be fair.

3334
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:23,740
Because that's not even the team that killed you guys that just killed me.

3335
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:25,120
It's a completely different squad.

3336
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,360
Wait, your squad is already on red.

3337
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,820
With 34 damage.

3338
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:33,390
Bro, that was Max's team too.

3339
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,560
I'm so sad.

3340
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:37,960
How do I...

3341
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,120
I'm so sad.

3342
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,940
How do we not get a beacon?

3343
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:43,360
How do we not get a single scan in three games out of Command Center?

3344
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,300
Or fucking Turbine?

3345
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:53,040
All I'm saying is, like, I think we need to let Tempo roam free and maybe we'll kill...

3346
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:53,120
Yeah.

3347
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,580
Tempo, I might just make you...

3348
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:54,800
Is that what we're doing?

3349
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,280
I might make you play a controller legend and you just literally land on a beacon somewhere.

3350
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:03,020
And if you make it to us, by the time we get his dome, we're good.

3351
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:03,900
We're so good.

3352
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,020
I swear, this is like the best strat.

3353
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,660
We let him roam free.

3354
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,100
Okay.

3355
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:08,500
Wait, wait, wait.

3356
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3357
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,180
You literally land on one of those where you scan it across the map and you just meet up with him.

3358
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:14,820
Wait, what map is next then?

3359
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,180
Next is gonna be Geyser again.

3360
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:18,680
Geyser...

3361
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,660
That's what I'm saying, bro.

3362
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:21,580
Geyser, we should have a beacon somewhere, man.

3363
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:24,440
Oh no, not even Commanders League, a 90% and fucking...

3364
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,440
I'm losing it.

3365
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:25,880
I'm losing it.

3366
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:26,100
I'm losing it.

3367
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:31,100
Bro, I just wanna get into one fight, like an actual fight.

3368
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:31,460
I know.

3369
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:32,980
I wanna beat you to the end game.

3370
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:35,640
This is crazy.

3371
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,200
This is insane.

3372
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:37,840
Guys, okay.

3373
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:38,100
I'm gonna go back to the game.

3374
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:38,620
Okay, okay.

3375
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:38,840
Okay, Temple.

3376
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,840
I believe in you to be free.

3377
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,420
Be free, Temple.

3378
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,900
I can't believe it.

3379
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:54,460
I can't believe we got walked up on and Temple, I didn't even hear anything.

3380
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,260
We didn't hear the walk up at all.

3381
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,780
I have no idea how this possible, dude.

3382
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,760
Release him from his shackles.

3383
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,480
Why is that two walking up on me?

3384
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,740
It was Max's team.

3385
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,080
It was Max's team.

3386
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,220
I fucking knew he was gonna kill us.

3387
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:11,420
Different fucking teams.

3388
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,340
Two teams that pursued our building.

3389
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,040
Oh my god, that is insane.

3390
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:20,360
Now I understand Sweet Dreams Restoration not getting beacons.

3391
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,580
It's insane.

3392
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,140
It's nice that you're doing a Watch Party in your own tournament.

3393
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:25,660
I'm banning you.

3394
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,160
Oh my god, three.

3395
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,320
This is like your own tournament too.

3396
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,860
Why is your own tournament so fucked up?

3397
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:35,280
Why is it so cursed against you?

3398
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:36,220
Why do they hate us bro?

3399
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:36,980
Why do they hate us?

3400
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:37,860
Okay, we're back.

3401
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,380
What do you mean we're back?

3402
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,360
We were already back.

3403
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,100
It can't be my own tournament and then we have a good time.

3404
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,840
But those of you that know, we're gonna have a good time.

3405
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:45,180
It's okay.

3406
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:45,840
It's okay.

3407
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,060
Those teams that are winning right now, they're not having as fun as we are.

3408
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,260
Do you think that's actually true though?

3409
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,640
They might be winning.

3410
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,620
Do you think that's true?

3411
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,820
Do you believe that with your whole chest?

3412
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:06,880
They might be winning, but they're not having as fun as we are.

3413
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:08,680
That couldn't be more true.

3414
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:09,140
I agree.

3415
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,820
Because somehow, I'm rage induced, but I'm just having a great time.

3416
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:19,900
Just remember that winning isn't everything.

3417
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,980
They might win more money and be more financially secured.

3418
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,260
But...

3419
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:29,360
But what did we do?

3420
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:30,540
We laughed more.

3421
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:33,920
But homies for life.

3422
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,040
I know.

3423
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:36,000
I know.

3424
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:38,820
Actually homies for life.

3425
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:39,680
Aren't they dead?

3426
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,300
Oh, they go to the corner.

3427
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:40,720
Yeah.

3428
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:48,140
Those teams that are doing much better than us and that are winning, you know they won't be back together after this tournament.

3429
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,780
Also, like, they're fucking nerds a little bit, right?

3430
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:51,880
Yeah, they won't.

3431
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:52,680
They're kind of a little bit nerds.

3432
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,420
Yeah, they're fucking nerds.

3433
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:55,500
How dare they be good at a video game?

3434
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,240
I'm just saying.

3435
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:57,920
I have the courage to be good.

3436
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:02,840
But you know they won't reconvene back together and do a reunion or anything.

3437
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,500
They're gonna forget each other the next day.

3438
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:05,340
Yeah.

3439
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:06,400
But we won't.

3440
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,320
We're relatable.

3441
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,540
Chat, how did that... is this making you feel better, chat?

3442
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,500
Yeah, we're like...

3443
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,100
Honestly, because we're here.

3444
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:15,560
We're like the team where it's like if we can be in a tournament, so can you.

3445
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,840
Anything is possible for you guys.

3446
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:26,940
If they are allowing us to play this tournament with all these pro players who are infinitely better than us, that means you can too one day.

3447
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:27,440
Oh, speak for yourself.

3448
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,360
Wait, wait, wait.

3449
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,500
Wait, wait.

3450
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:29,940
Wait, wait.

3451
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:30,760
I'm included in that?

3452
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,340
I'm included in that?

3453
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:33,760
I'm included in that?

3454
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,080
I'm really better than you.

3455
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:34,280
I'm really better than you.

3456
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,440
I won't say though.

3457
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,680
After those shots I just gave them, that was... they're definitely infinitely better.

3458
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:43,180
I just gave them 14 warning shots.

3459
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:45,760
See, you're so relatable.

3460
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,200
I'm right.

3461
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,020
Thank you.

3462
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:48,680
You're so relatable.

3463
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,420
No, I'm just down to earth.

3464
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,000
You know what I mean?

3465
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,600
Like, get it?

3466
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,300
Yeah, exactly.

3467
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,060
You're humans.

3468
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:57,240
Like when chat watches other pro players, they're like, oh my god, these shots are inhumane.

3469
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,100
That's what I'm saying.

3470
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:03,220
There's no way he's able to... but then when they watch you, they're like, oh yeah, he's definitely a real person.

3471
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,440
That can be fun.

3472
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,660
He's definitely a player.

3473
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:06,680
Yeah.

3474
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:07,780
From Apex Legends.

3475
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:09,380
I shit just like you guys.

3476
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,140
Yeah, yeah.

3477
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:13,220
And they're like... people will be like, oh my god, he's on controller and still missing?

3478
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,280
So relatable.

3479
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,560
Guys,

3480
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:26,220
I have a secret plan.

3481
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,560
What's your secret plan?

3482
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:29,340
What's your...

3483
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,220
There's two teams contesting at Harvester.

3484
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:32,600
So?

3485
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,240
I wouldn't let me brush.

3486
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,380
Yeah, what does that mean for us?

3487
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:36,460
We're literally on Geyser.

3488
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,860
I'm not third.

3489
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:39,840
I'm not third.

3490
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,200
I'm on Geyser.

3491
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:40,680
I'm on Bando.

3492
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,280
I'm someone you see.

3493
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,040
You know exactly what...

3494
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:43,900
Internet crash.

3495
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,960
You know exactly what that means.

3496
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,500
What the fuck does that mean?

3497
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:48,700
Yo, we need some KP.

3498
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:52,880
There's no way we're gonna be able to get there from Geyser without getting shot at.

3499
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,600
Who said we're landing Geyser?

3500
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,460
Okay, is Temple gonna...

3501
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,480
Temple, you can third party them for us.

3502
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:02,080
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3503
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,120
Throw, throw, throw.

3504
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:04,220
Great idea, bro.

3505
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:04,540
I'm gonna go to Geyser.

3506
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,600
Okay, you two land Geyser and loot.

3507
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:11,860
I'll land Harvester and try to sneak like a free kill or two.

3508
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,220
Yeah.

3509
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:12,700
And then I'll run away.

3510
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:13,360
Yeah, exactly.

3511
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,200
And then if you...

3512
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:17,760
And then I'll loot No Name and then I'll meet up with you guys at Geyser.

3513
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,380
No, no, if he fails, if he fails, we have...

3514
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,780
We can just craft the at Geyser.

3515
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,060
Yeah, we can craft him in Geyser.

3516
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:23,920
That is so smart.

3517
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,440
Did you guys just watch that Vantage?

3518
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:27,660
That looked like us out there.

3519
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:28,400
That was crazy.

3520
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,700
I was thinking it was Strat.

3521
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,120
You have to do a full fucking...

3522
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,140
No, I had...

3523
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:33,640
I had...

3524
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:33,740
I had...

3525
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:34,200
I had...

3526
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,380
I had max POV there.

3527
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:36,420
Oh, okay.

3528
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,380
Okay, okay, yeah.

3529
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,020
Well, we'll...

3530
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,940
I mean, we are sending Tempo out to roam.

3531
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,720
So, Tempo, you're gonna land on Harvester.

3532
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:44,260
Oh, my game crashed.

3533
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:44,780
Oh.

3534
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:46,460
Wait, it didn't crash.

3535
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:49,020
My Discord restart set itself, but I'm okay now.

3536
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:49,660
Yeah.

3537
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,120
We have a plan.

3538
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:56,920
We have guaranteed one kill plan.

3539
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:57,440
We're just gonna...

3540
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,020
We're just gonna let Tempo roam free around the map.

3541
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:01,920
For...

3542
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,660
I'm gonna go third Harvester and then Suicide and then...

3543
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,900
And then you guys craft me a geyser and then bring me back to life.

3544
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:08,260
Yeah.

3545
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,160
That's the best plan you've ever had.

3546
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,080
Should guarantee us one kill.

3547
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,060
Yeah.

3548
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:15,180
One point is very zero.

3549
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:15,520
And then we're back in the game.

3550
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,140
I don't know about back in the game, but yeah.

3551
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:19,300
Back in the game.

3552
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:19,860
Yeah.

3553
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:25,300
See, now I'm kinda happy we didn't play this zone again.

3554
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:25,880
You know what I mean?

3555
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,800
I think you're just coping, Wig.

3556
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:29,740
No, never.

3557
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,260
I think you're just coping.

3558
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,780
No, this makes sense.

3559
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,140
Playing this zone has been way too difficult.

3560
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:35,660
I think you're just coping, Wig.

3561
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,520
I'm not kidding.

3562
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:40,940
I actually went 0 for 7 on Sentinel shots to cover for you guys.

3563
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,800
I said I'm covering for you guys and I did not cover once.

3564
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:44,660
I'm covering.

3565
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:45,520
We ran up.

3566
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:45,900
We died.

3567
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,320
That's why we're so relatable.

3568
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:48,800
Thank you.

3569
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,680
People watch us for the relatability.

3570
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:51,340
No, I know.

3571
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:51,920
I'm down to earth.

3572
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:52,280
I get it.

3573
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:52,520
Thank you.

3574
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:52,880
Yeah.

3575
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,580
People are like...

3576
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:57,320
People don't wanna watch a robot.

3577
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:01,580
They wanna watch somebody that can make mistakes despite how many they make.

3578
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:04,080
They wanna just feel like they...

3579
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,040
Is it a mistake?

3580
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:05,640
Yeah.

3581
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:06,560
They make mistakes.

3582
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,980
Despite how many they make.

3583
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:16,080
Look, I'm saying as a team.

3584
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:16,700
As a team.

3585
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:17,840
As a team.

3586
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,940
I'm not singling out...

3587
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:19,220
That's better.

3588
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:19,700
Way better.

3589
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:20,720
As a team, guys.

3590
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,720
I'm not singling out anybody here.

3591
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:27,300
But if anyone wants to give out examples of how they made mistakes, that's on them.

3592
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:28,440
For sure.

3593
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,780
I can't think of a mistake for my end, but like...

3594
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:32,100
Oh, no.

3595
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:32,500
Never.

3596
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,160
No, no.

3597
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,740
No, we never...

3598
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:35,220
No, no.

3599
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:35,640
No, no.

3600
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:36,600
No.

3601
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,340
That's because you don't make them.

3602
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:37,840
But like if anybody...

3603
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:43,300
If anybody else wants to tell what mistakes they made, that's totally fine.

3604
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,380
Yeah, Tempo, if you wanna open up, bro, we're not gonna judge.

3605
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,140
Yeah, yeah.

3606
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,880
You wanna open up too, Tempo.

3607
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:48,720
Like...

3608
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:49,900
Zero mistakes.

3609
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:52,080
Oh!

3610
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:53,480
Oh, zero mistakes.

3611
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:54,280
Oh, okay.

3612
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,340
Then we know.

3613
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:56,580
Zero is a little delusional.

3614
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:57,140
No, no.

3615
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,460
Just a little.

3616
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,180
I like how when I was like, I don't remember my mistakes.

3617
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,180
You're like, yeah, you're right.

3618
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:05,100
And then for Tempo, it's like, oh, you're delusional.

3619
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:05,600
I don't remember what happened.

3620
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:05,620
I don't know.

3621
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,080
Okay, my mistake is just...

3622
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:07,820
Why can't you put that down?

3623
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:08,960
It went out the window.

3624
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,320
Double Moby is crazy and we can't even find an evac fucking tower.

3625
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:17,880
We can't even find... there was no fucking anything in my package.

3626
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,120
I got purple evac.

3627
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,140
That was great.

3628
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,620
And they got double Moby.

3629
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,580
And we can't find a fucking evac.

3630
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:27,920
Unreal.

3631
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:28,760
It's okay.

3632
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:29,720
Oh, there you go.

3633
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,000
All our luck...

3634
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,800
I think it's because you're the tournament organizer.

3635
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,340
Every fucking luck is not with us.

3636
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:36,780
That's lowkey true though.

3637
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:39,660
I feel like I actually cursed myself by being the organizer.

3638
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,320
You should have been a caster.

3639
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:40,840
What?

3640
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:42,820
You should have...

3641
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:44,040
Okay, you know what would have been funny?

3642
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:44,620
You should have...

3643
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:47,300
Honestly, Greek should have been a caster in your tournament.

3644
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:51,560
Honestly, they asked me if I wanted to play or cast.

3645
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,720
I don't think I regret my decision yet.

3646
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,540
I feel like it would have been so funny that Greek would...

3647
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,660
If Greek was a caster in your own tournament.

3648
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,780
In my own, that would be so funny.

3649
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,020
That would be so fucked.

3650
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:08,420
That would be so fucked.

3651
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,000
Just make him watch?

3652
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,700
Yeah, just make him do a watch party.

3653
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,440
That would be so fucked.

3654
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:22,800
Wait, whose team is this?

3655
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:23,860
Oh my god.

3656
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,100
You still casted it so far.

3657
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:25,780
Wait a minute.

3658
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:26,840
Ew.

3659
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:28,940
Can't what?

3660
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,340
It was a two.

3661
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:33,300
It's anonymous mode.

3662
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:34,660
They are, for some reason.

3663
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:35,400
They did touch us.

3664
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:38,300
Yeah, it's been on this entire game.

3665
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:40,480
How the hell do you feel?

3666
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,460
I didn't notice.

3667
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:45,580
Just self revive on Lifeline.

3668
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,360
It's crazy, ggs.

3669
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,860
That boy, Yania would win.

3670
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,080
I'm kinda happy about that to be honest.

3671
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:53,820
Yeah, you know what, them winning is like we're winning, yeah Temple you got our.

3672
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:54,440
No, we're not landing.

3673
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:56,480
No, let him land on Harvester.

3674
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,200
You can just craft me.

3675
01:52:58,220 --> 01:52:58,840
We can craft him.

3676
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:03,580
Something is alluded to, it's the smartest thing we can ever do.

3677
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:04,340
That's like Gary and I being weißed.

3678
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:05,180
Guarantee one point.

3679
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:10,020
Make sure you know they're going there though.

3680
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,380
I just need a fuse.

3681
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,380
No, he analyzed the situation.

3682
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:15,500
Yeah.

3683
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,160
Yeah, he made a spreadsheet and everything.

3684
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,220
How many games is this?

3685
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:24,000
Is this like six games or five games?

3686
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:24,360
Three more.

3687
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:25,460
We got three more to get.

3688
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,120
Okay, this plan should work.

3689
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,820
Three more to get.

3690
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:32,760
Oh boy.

3691
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,460
25 points?

3692
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,740
So we need eight a game?

3693
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:40,180
Wait, Jent is going...

3694
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:41,000
Harvester.

3695
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:42,020
Wait, he's going Harvester.

3696
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,080
I think that's one of the teams.

3697
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,260
Someone else is going Harvester.

3698
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,600
We haven't...

3699
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,860
Janja and...

3700
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:51,700
Janja and who?

3701
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:54,820
Where's Jent?

3702
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:03,400
We're two Harvesters here.

3703
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:04,760
Who's the two Harvester team?

3704
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:07,680
Oh yeah, Janja and Jent.

3705
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:10,220
Oh shit, I'm gonna be like, we're landing Harvester too.

3706
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:11,840
No, no, no.

3707
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:13,280
Give him no warning.

3708
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:13,940
No, no, no.

3709
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:16,260
Let Santan by himself, bro.

3710
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:18,440
Okay, okay, okay.

3711
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,820
Wait, we need to wait for the Legends.

3712
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,700
I need to be able to throw like a million nades at them.

3713
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:25,080
And just run away.

3714
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:27,160
No, you're supposed to get one kill.

3715
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:28,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3716
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:30,900
A million nades, one or two kills, and then run away.

3717
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:31,420
A million nades.

3718
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,840
You're so confident in game now.

3719
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:35,240
Bro, you need to die.

3720
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:37,460
No, I'm gonna...

3721
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:41,380
If you die by the time we're leaving Geyser, then we can't craft you.

3722
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:43,520
I gotta loot No Name.

3723
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:45,680
I'll kill them, and then...

3724
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:46,400
Oh wait.

3725
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,100
I'll kill all of them and then just loot all of Harvester myself.

3726
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:50,700
Exactly!

3727
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,180
You go in there and just guarantee a kill.

3728
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:54,400
It doesn't matter.

3729
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:57,620
Just guarantee a kill for us.

3730
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:58,920
I'm catching...

3731
01:54:59,520 --> 01:54:59,960
Fusey.

3732
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,700
What are they saying in the chat, bro?

3733
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:03,620
There's no Fuse.

3734
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,300
Pathfinder, Octane, Bloodhound, Rampart, Catalyst.

3735
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:08,600
Alright, so obviously I'm playing...

3736
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,560
I guess I'll play either Globa or Newcastle.

3737
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:11,560
Which one should I do?

3738
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,640
I feel like we're always poor on loot.

3739
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,920
I feel like...

3740
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,940
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

3741
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,260
I feel like we have been doing really well in the loot department.

3742
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:21,820
Just saying.

3743
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,660
Yeah, I mean, what dickhead put us on this PLA?

3744
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:24,940
Oh wait.

3745
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,180
This is the one game that doesn't have an assault.

3746
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:28,340
No.

3747
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:29,200
That's fine.

3748
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:29,480
That's fine.

3749
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:29,900
It's fine.

3750
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:30,500
You don't need it.

3751
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,780
All you need to do is just kill them.

3752
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,440
That's really it.

3753
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,540
If you're dropping over there, we need the ring.

3754
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,280
We're gonna have to wait for you to craft the ring.

3755
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:39,980
I'll just kill all of them and then do the ring at Harvester.

3756
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,100
You're so optimistic.

3757
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:41,900
I hate it.

3758
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:42,140
Okay.

3759
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:42,920
Let's do it.

3760
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:43,080
Yeah.

3761
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:43,740
Okay.

3762
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:44,540
I'm down.

3763
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:45,880
This is what our brain is telling us.

3764
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:47,620
We need a rubber to listen to our brain.

3765
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:48,380
Yeah.

3766
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:49,960
Rampart or Catalyst then?

3767
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,860
Well, that's on you guys.

3768
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,280
I'm good with my choices.

3769
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,160
Who are you going for?

3770
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,660
Left and then...

3771
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:00,780
Who are you playing, Doki?

3772
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,720
I'm playing Loba for the loot.

3773
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:03,900
Because we're always poor.

3774
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:04,880
Yeah.

3775
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:05,740
I'm gonna play Octane.

3776
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,720
We're always broke.

3777
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,780
What do you mean?

3778
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:11,100
We're so broke all the time.

3779
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:14,820
This is it.

3780
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:15,240
This time.

3781
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:16,480
No.

3782
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,340
I actually think this is the one.

3783
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:17,680
I'm not kidding.

3784
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,180
This is the one.

3785
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:18,780
100%.

3786
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,160
Wait.

3787
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,120
Since you're the headliner, right?

3788
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:25,600
Can you make them make up an award for us?

3789
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,480
Like the most...

3790
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,180
the happiest team?

3791
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:30,000
Or something?

3792
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:32,960
The happiest team?

3793
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,640
I feel like it would be first.

3794
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:35,560
Gotta be a little bit happier.

3795
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:38,920
Okay.

3796
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:40,580
I'm not saying my happiness levels are down.

3797
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:41,320
But you know what I mean?

3798
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,400
The most fun team.

3799
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:44,700
Like...

3800
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,860
That one we take.

3801
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,680
Teams with the best vibes.

3802
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,060
Yeah.

3803
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:51,980
Tell them.

3804
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:52,840
Tell the...

3805
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,560
Twitch Rivals staff to pick...

3806
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,780
You know the Golden Cockies?

3807
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,200
Yeah!

3808
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:58,860
They should nominate us.

3809
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:00,780
The Golden Cockies?

3810
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:01,360
What is that?

3811
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:03,460
What is it called?

3812
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,180
The Golden Pants?

3813
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:07,640
The Pants!

3814
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,440
What is it called?

3815
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:11,780
Cackies?

3816
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,400
Cackies!

3817
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:12,840
Yes!

3818
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:13,520
Cackies!

3819
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:16,180
Is that how you pronounce it?

3820
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:17,560
The Golden Cockies.

3821
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,700
The Golden Cockies.

3822
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:22,620
They have to nominate us for the Golden Cockies.

3823
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:25,280
And then we win by sheer popular vote.

3824
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:27,320
Unless Hal is in there.

3825
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,840
So obviously we're not gonna win.

3826
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:28,860
No, no, no.

3827
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:30,220
Your VTuber army wins.

3828
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,160
No, no.

3829
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,220
I think...

3830
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:36,740
I don't know about that.

3831
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,240
We'll pee fast.

3832
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:39,380
Is that time?

3833
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:40,380
Yeah, there's time.

3834
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:41,540
Okay, I'm going.

3835
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:41,780
I'm going.

3836
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:42,000
I'm going.

3837
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:42,380
Okay.

3838
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:47,920
Who is everyone running... oh.

3839
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:55,610
It's okay.

3840
01:57:55,810 --> 01:57:57,070
They're not gonna start the game.

3841
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:01,170
You're not gonna start the game.

3842
01:58:01,190 --> 01:58:02,110
We're so fine.

3843
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:03,890
Yep.

3844
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:04,710
Oh my gosh.

3845
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:05,750
Alright, alright.

3846
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:07,150
So the plan, Tempo.

3847
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:09,010
You, Harvester.

3848
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:10,330
You die.

3849
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:11,310
I wish I had a fuse.

3850
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:12,430
For a kill.

3851
01:58:12,530 --> 01:58:13,330
Wait, what are you playing in?

3852
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:14,990
Cat.

3853
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:21,430
But if I get a kill and I can run, I'm gonna run through No Name and then meet up with you guys to wherever you run.

3854
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:23,210
Cause no one's looting No Name.

3855
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:25,010
Okay, but like...

3856
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:25,970
Wait, wait.

3857
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:28,170
How do I land in Harvester to grief?

3858
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:31,170
Yeah, I was gonna say how are you gonna... how are you gonna...

3859
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:32,750
get to us?

3860
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:37,250
Y'all can just punch some...

3861
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:37,830
Oh, no wait.

3862
01:58:37,970 --> 01:58:38,410
No, I can't.

3863
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:43,090
You're gonna punch...

3864
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:44,270
Don't punch someone.

3865
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:51,130
I was gonna say punch them into the lava and then block them with Rampart... punch them into the lava and then block them with Rampart walls.

3866
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:52,470
Bro, just...

3867
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:59,910
Don't... don't...

3868
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,370
Tempo, your only job.

3869
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:04,910
Do what you can to get a kill.

3870
01:59:05,070 --> 01:59:06,050
Do not trip.

3871
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:07,770
That is your only mission.

3872
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:09,650
That's really it.

3873
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:13,490
I believe you, Tempo.

3874
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:15,050
I believe in us.

3875
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:16,970
I can't believe our first team was our peak.

3876
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:18,990
I can get... I can get two kills.

3877
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:19,230
I have good news.

3878
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:20,450
Wait, what's the good news?

3879
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:22,330
Greek isn't last with us.

3880
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:24,310
Wait, we're last too?

3881
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,010
No, that's good.

3882
01:59:27,110 --> 01:59:27,790
That's good.

3883
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,130
Wait, the score...

3884
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:29,990
Wait, Greek?

3885
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:33,430
Who's Greek on...

3886
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:35,490
Wait, we have five points.

3887
01:59:35,850 --> 01:59:36,370
Yes!

3888
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:37,990
So he's guaranteed last.

3889
01:59:38,170 --> 01:59:39,130
Oh my god, it's the best M.O.I.

3890
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:41,890
Oh my god, it's amazing.

3891
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:43,050
Wait, who's Greek with?

3892
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,270
Reptar.

3893
01:59:44,330 --> 01:59:45,370
Reptar and...

3894
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:46,890
Didn't Reptar pick first?

3895
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,930
Yeah.

3896
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,870
Oh, Doki just exploded.

3897
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:57,770
Wait, what about Lich?

3898
01:59:57,790 --> 01:59:59,430
He's sending tunnel that's close to the balloon.

3899
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:01,270
What's tunnel that's close to the balloon?

3900
02:00:01,610 --> 02:00:02,130
Wait...

3901
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,610
In Harvester.

3902
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:05,730
He picked first though.

3903
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:07,110
How did he...

3904
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,370
It's the curse.

3905
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:12,350
It's the curse.

3906
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:13,830
I can feel the curse.

3907
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:14,890
There's a tunnel?

3908
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,910
Oh, it started.

3909
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:19,430
You guys have your picks?

3910
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:20,930
I have my pick.

3911
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:22,610
Wig?

3912
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:23,710
Wig?

3913
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:25,850
I bet you Wig ran into Greek.

3914
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:28,450
I have minus five.

3915
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:29,910
We only have five points.

3916
02:00:30,650 --> 02:00:31,090
You have your pick?

3917
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:31,550
Who am I playing?

3918
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:31,950
Who am I playing?

3919
02:00:32,090 --> 02:00:33,210
I thought you were playing Octane.

3920
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:35,330
Yeah, I'm playing Loba.

3921
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:36,810
Yeah, I got cat.

3922
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:41,530
I was gonna say, we only have five points.

3923
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:43,090
We can't have a minus five.

3924
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:47,110
I mean, even if we got ten points here, we're still bottom five.

3925
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:48,190
I mean, even if we got ten points here, we're still bottom five.

3926
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:48,570
Wait, what?

3927
02:00:49,170 --> 02:00:49,850
Wait, what?

3928
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:50,970
Where are you seeing the scores?

3929
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:52,910
The Google Sheet thing isn't updated.

3930
02:00:53,230 --> 02:00:53,990
I'm just guessing.

3931
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:54,570
I'm guessing here.

3932
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:55,570
Oh, okay.

3933
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:58,710
Bro, what happened to us?

3934
02:00:58,790 --> 02:01:00,290
We fell off, man.

3935
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,170
We were never on.

3936
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:03,570
What do you mean?

3937
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:04,510
We did so well.

3938
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:07,650
We did so well last Rivals.

3939
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:08,770
What happened to us?

3940
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:11,670
Watch this redemption round.

3941
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:12,570
Temple's gonna kill it right here.

3942
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:13,750
Okay, Temple, just remember.

3943
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:14,750
Just leave us.

3944
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:15,370
Remember to solo.

3945
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:16,190
You didn't pick.

3946
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:17,450
I picked Pathfinder, not Octane.

3947
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:17,630
It's fine.

3948
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:19,170
Is Pathfinder fine?

3949
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:19,670
Is Pathfinder fine?

3950
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:19,930
Oh, it is.

3951
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:20,630
Okay.

3952
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:21,670
No minus five.

3953
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:22,570
Jesus Christ.

3954
02:01:22,570 --> 02:01:23,070
Oh, my God.

3955
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,310
There's the zero points.

3956
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:25,530
Holy fuck, dude.

3957
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:28,070
Oh, my God.

3958
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:29,150
Goodbye, Temple.

3959
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:30,270
Goodbye.

3960
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:31,830
Oh, my God.

3961
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:32,230
Thank God.

3962
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:33,930
Pathfinder's a choice, chat.

3963
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:34,230
We're good.

3964
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:37,710
Yo, they see one random person just flying.

3965
02:01:38,190 --> 02:01:38,690
Yo, they see one random person just flying.

3966
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:39,610
Yo, there is a contest here.

3967
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:40,850
Yes, there is.

3968
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:41,390
I see the contest.

3969
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:42,070
Oh, my God.

3970
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:42,990
They're landing on each other.

3971
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:44,450
Okay, don't get off me.

3972
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:45,130
I'm gonna go left here.

3973
02:01:45,210 --> 02:01:45,630
Okay, okay.

3974
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:46,890
They're literally landing on each other.

3975
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,530
Temple, I am waiting for that.

3976
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:49,590
I am...

3977
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:53,430
I am waiting... There's no fucking stance on us anyway, so we're fine.

3978
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:53,910
I'm dead.

3979
02:01:54,590 --> 02:01:55,070
Wait, what?

3980
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:56,490
No, I'm okay.

3981
02:01:56,490 --> 02:01:56,670
I'm alive.

3982
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:57,430
Oh, my God.

3983
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:59,610
There's someone landing inside the no-name.

3984
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:00,850
Okay, okay.

3985
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:02,230
You scared the shit out of me there.

3986
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,410
That scared the shit out of me too.

3987
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:03,930
Yeah.

3988
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:05,090
Wait, they're not...

3989
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:06,710
They're not fighting?

3990
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:08,270
How about you need to die?

3991
02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:09,890
Wait, you guys have beacon over there?

3992
02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:11,370
No, of course not.

3993
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:13,310
No, we need you to die, brother.

3994
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:14,610
We need you to die.

3995
02:02:14,610 --> 02:02:16,830
We were solely dependent on you dying here.

3996
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:17,910
Yo, I got his beacon.

3997
02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:19,090
I'm running back to you.

3998
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:19,950
I got a beacon?

3999
02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:22,910
I'm stealing their loot and I'm running with their beacon.

4000
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:23,830
I thought they were contesting.

4001
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:24,330
What happened?

4002
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:24,970
They are.

4003
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:26,190
They're contesting very far away.

4004
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:27,510
Oh, okay.

4005
02:02:28,150 --> 02:02:29,290
Very far away.

4006
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:30,490
It's okay.

4007
02:02:30,670 --> 02:02:32,090
I got a beacon.

4008
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:32,230
We got a beacon.

4009
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:34,790
We have a god spot here, guys.

4010
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:35,630
We're zoned?

4011
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:37,910
Yeah, we have a zone on us.

4012
02:02:38,970 --> 02:02:39,490
I'm running.

4013
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:39,850
I'm running.

4014
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:41,130
Look at the zone.

4015
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:42,730
It's gonna pull up towards the overlook side.

4016
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,490
We got a scan?

4017
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:46,310
Now they're gonna think we're a duo.

4018
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:47,450
Oh, no.

4019
02:02:50,710 --> 02:02:51,110
They're gonna send us.

4020
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:51,590
Oh, my god.

4021
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:52,130
They're gonna send us.

4022
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:54,090
I will bet my entire life they send us.

4023
02:02:54,190 --> 02:02:57,530
Our whole plan was for Tempo to die, but yet he's still alive.

4024
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:58,970
I'm still fucking alive, man.

4025
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:02,890
I left this house for you, except for the helmet.

4026
02:03:02,890 --> 02:03:03,110
It's fine.

4027
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:05,270
I'm more focused on these guys actually coming to kill us.

4028
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:08,250
In the end, I'm not even trying to be funny.

4029
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:08,530
I absolutely am.

4030
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:11,650
What if Tempo is the one that crafts us in the end?

4031
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:13,370
That would be actually so...

4032
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:14,270
That would actually be poetic.

4033
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:17,590
That would be beautiful.

4034
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:20,170
That would be so sad.

4035
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:22,110
No, I have a W.

4036
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:26,130
Oh, I have a Havoc Turbo.

4037
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:26,610
Now we won.

4038
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:30,050
I have a R9 Bolt.

4039
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:31,890
I'm only short range.

4040
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:34,110
I'm gonna craft a...

4041
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:35,670
Alright, Tempo, are you okay?

4042
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:37,510
I'm gonna craft a bat if you...

4043
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:38,230
Yeah, I'm going to you.

4044
02:03:38,330 --> 02:03:38,670
I'm going to you.

4045
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:40,590
Okay, I'm gonna craft a bat then.

4046
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:42,890
I'm making sure I'm not getting sent down.

4047
02:03:42,970 --> 02:03:43,570
We're okay right now.

4048
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:44,250
We're good.

4049
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:44,930
Yeah, we're okay.

4050
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:46,630
We need to get to the zone now, Tempo.

4051
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:47,850
So get over here quick and we're gonna go.

4052
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:49,090
Yeah, I'm here now.

4053
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:50,670
We're gonna get inside Overlook somewhere.

4054
02:03:50,910 --> 02:03:52,190
I just don't know where the zone is exactly ending.

4055
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:54,450
That's my evac.

4056
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:55,770
Woo!

4057
02:03:57,330 --> 02:03:57,610
Nice.

4058
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,530
I have an increased range for my ult.

4059
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:03,290
I can ult whenever, but I'll wait a little bit.

4060
02:04:03,670 --> 02:04:04,450
I'm evacing to you.

4061
02:04:05,210 --> 02:04:06,470
Wait, he's gonna evac to us?

4062
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:07,470
That's fine.

4063
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,310
I was always gonna go here.

4064
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:09,070
That's okay, whatever.

4065
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:10,250
Wait, are we staying here?

4066
02:04:11,170 --> 02:04:11,670
No, we're going.

4067
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:11,910
We're going.

4068
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:13,190
Okay, I'm coming over here.

4069
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:14,590
I'm towards Overlook for sure.

4070
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:15,570
That's where it's gonna end.

4071
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:20,990
Any of that fucking shit up top, any of those houses up top, bro, we are vibing.

4072
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:21,870
Like, we're actually chilling.

4073
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:25,170
We can get routed on here pretty hard.

4074
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,010
So, we gotta watch out.

4075
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:26,430
We have no scans.

4076
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:28,150
And team's gonna have Bloodhound.

4077
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:31,830
So let me go first and whatever happens, just run away and craft me.

4078
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:34,390
I'm giving you the lead here.

4079
02:04:34,930 --> 02:04:35,850
I'm not kidding.

4080
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:38,790
At any moment, if you think we're losing this gunfight, you guys run.

4081
02:04:39,110 --> 02:04:39,750
I don't care if I have two.

4082
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:41,190
What if that's every moment?

4083
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:43,390
Who looted inside here?

4084
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:44,310
I did.

4085
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:44,570
I did.

4086
02:04:44,930 --> 02:04:46,290
I have an extra battle to start.

4087
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:47,150
You guys are far.

4088
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:51,910
Okay, I was gonna say, I can loot the vault right now.

4089
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:53,330
Oh, loot the vault!

4090
02:04:53,650 --> 02:04:54,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4091
02:04:54,650 --> 02:04:55,210
I'm gonna loot the vault.

4092
02:04:56,350 --> 02:04:58,470
I'm watching this thingy.

4093
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:00,030
I need to close my blinds, cause I actually can't see.

4094
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:01,970
Yeah, I was gonna say, where the fuck did you go?

4095
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:02,970
We're good.

4096
02:05:02,990 --> 02:05:03,230
We're good.

4097
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:05,890
Let's see.

4098
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,690
I'm gonna grab...

4099
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:09,210
I'm gonna grab the knockback shield.

4100
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:09,690
Yeah.

4101
02:05:10,650 --> 02:05:11,190
Knockback shield.

4102
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:11,810
Never heard of that.

4103
02:05:11,870 --> 02:05:12,290
Let's do it.

4104
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:14,690
Knockdown.

4105
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:15,570
Knockdown.

4106
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:20,210
I got the knockdown shield, guys.

4107
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:21,670
If you guys get down, I have gold.

4108
02:05:22,150 --> 02:05:24,070
If you get knocked, just get back up.

4109
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:26,390
Yeah, it's a knockback.

4110
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:27,950
Yup, yup, yup.

4111
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:29,430
Alright, keep on moving.

4112
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:29,830
Keep on moving.

4113
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:30,110
We're good.

4114
02:05:30,210 --> 02:05:31,010
I'm right behind you.

4115
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:32,310
We're doing great, guys.

4116
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:32,830
Seriously.

4117
02:05:33,010 --> 02:05:33,270
Not last.

4118
02:05:33,610 --> 02:05:34,070
Nineteen plays.

4119
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:38,210
Each placement is an improvement.

4120
02:05:39,130 --> 02:05:39,530
Wait, wait.

4121
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:40,070
Don't come over here.

4122
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:40,450
Wait, wait.

4123
02:05:40,910 --> 02:05:41,370
Okay, okay.

4124
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:41,770
Come, come, come.

4125
02:05:41,850 --> 02:05:42,190
We're good.

4126
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:43,270
Okay.

4127
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:46,350
I'm putting all my trust in you.

4128
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:48,450
I shouldn't, but like...

4129
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:49,450
Don't do that, please.

4130
02:05:49,670 --> 02:05:50,030
Don't worry.

4131
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:51,930
I'm gonna give you more pressure.

4132
02:05:52,610 --> 02:05:53,130
Alright, keep moving.

4133
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:54,270
I'll give you comms real quick.

4134
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:54,490
One sec.

4135
02:05:57,430 --> 02:05:58,330
Can't tell if there's someone here or not.

4136
02:05:59,230 --> 02:06:00,010
I cannot, dude.

4137
02:06:00,170 --> 02:06:00,710
I don't think so.

4138
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:01,070
I don't think so.

4139
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:01,890
I'm gonna go on height.

4140
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:02,850
Okay.

4141
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,590
I got scanned.

4142
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:04,830
Yeah, we're good.

4143
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:05,930
I can hit beacon here, too.

4144
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:07,290
We're gonna play back here and hit the beacon late, okay?

4145
02:06:07,450 --> 02:06:07,650
Okay.

4146
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:10,190
How about right here?

4147
02:06:10,350 --> 02:06:11,490
Tempo, you have anything you should this guy with?

4148
02:06:12,070 --> 02:06:12,310
Yeah.

4149
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:13,830
Can we climb up there?

4150
02:06:13,850 --> 02:06:14,610
No, we can't.

4151
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:16,150
We can like be on the ledge here.

4152
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:17,610
I think I can give you guys a zipline though if you need it.

4153
02:06:17,630 --> 02:06:18,670
Yeah, we need a zipline here.

4154
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:19,970
You guys can get over here to zipline.

4155
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:20,670
I wanna put it down below.

4156
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:21,850
Alright, yeah, yeah.

4157
02:06:21,850 --> 02:06:22,230
We're here.

4158
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:23,730
Yeah, come over.

4159
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:24,690
I'll have 20% on it.

4160
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:25,250
Just stay up here for now.

4161
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:28,310
Just put out... Did you put Kaku's over here, Tempo, at all?

4162
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:29,550
Uh, yeah.

4163
02:06:29,650 --> 02:06:30,590
I threw one up over there.

4164
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:32,010
Yeah, we're gonna do that for right now.

4165
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:33,810
This is ramparts.

4166
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:35,210
So teams are definitely gonna get down here for sure.

4167
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:35,830
Alright.

4168
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:40,930
I have only short range.

4169
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:42,130
Okay.

4170
02:06:42,170 --> 02:06:42,790
I have long range.

4171
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:43,090
I'm good.

4172
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:43,750
I have flat.

4173
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:46,470
I ping the longbow and stuff.

4174
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:47,670
Yeah.

4175
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:48,530
Good.

4176
02:06:48,650 --> 02:06:49,350
I already have one.

4177
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:49,590
I'm showing.

4178
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:51,250
Yeah, yeah, but for tempo I meant.

4179
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:54,350
Let me check if there's any sniper... Oh, there's sniper ammo here if you need it.

4180
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:56,770
Oh, I might take it afterwards, yeah.

4181
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:58,530
I'm just gonna put it on this side to make sure no one pushes us.

4182
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:01,990
Are you fucking...

4183
02:07:02,570 --> 02:07:04,490
poking them with a fucking...

4184
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:05,150
Okay.

4185
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:07,110
One sec.

4186
02:07:07,390 --> 02:07:08,210
I'll do this for you guys.

4187
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:08,510
One sec.

4188
02:07:08,630 --> 02:07:09,210
You guys stay there, okay?

4189
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:12,010
I'm gonna do this for y'all just in case you wanna come up here.

4190
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:12,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4191
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:13,990
I wanna be free.

4192
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:15,470
I'll play the other side though.

4193
02:07:15,730 --> 02:07:16,350
You can go from there.

4194
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,150
I'll be here.

4195
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:19,530
They're fighting over here.

4196
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:19,930
They're fighting.

4197
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:21,190
Like how hard?

4198
02:07:21,230 --> 02:07:21,510
How hard?

4199
02:07:21,770 --> 02:07:22,310
Hard fighting.

4200
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:23,250
They just inted each other.

4201
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:24,430
They kill each other?

4202
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:24,790
Like, okay.

4203
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:26,570
Yeah, they're inting each other.

4204
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:26,710
Yeah.

4205
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:28,670
I don't think there was a way for us to get there.

4206
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:29,490
Yeah.

4207
02:07:32,210 --> 02:07:34,450
I'm gonna put a low ball right here so...

4208
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:35,410
See if there's a sniper.

4209
02:07:36,870 --> 02:07:37,370
Go for it.

4210
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,550
I'm gonna hit the beacon when it's closest.

4211
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:39,750
I have my zone thing now.

4212
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:41,010
So we're good to go.

4213
02:07:41,870 --> 02:07:42,190
Pew!

4214
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,890
Oh, there's snipers for you.

4215
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:45,250
There's snipers.

4216
02:07:46,670 --> 02:07:46,990
154.

4217
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:47,310
154.

4218
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:48,330
Okay.

4219
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,830
And there's sniper...

4220
02:07:50,790 --> 02:07:51,110
scopes.

4221
02:07:51,110 --> 02:07:51,790
There's sniper scopes.

4222
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:53,110
Dubs.

4223
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:53,350
Dubs.

4224
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:53,710
Dubs.

4225
02:07:54,030 --> 02:07:55,610
I hit the... I did my upgrade.

4226
02:07:55,730 --> 02:07:56,010
I'm gonna purge.

4227
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:58,050
Someone get the stuff before it's gone.

4228
02:07:58,050 --> 02:07:58,450
I'm going now.

4229
02:07:58,450 --> 02:07:58,750
I'm going now.

4230
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:00,010
Before someone shoots it.

4231
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:00,570
Look at the zone.

4232
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:00,850
Look at the zone.

4233
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:01,850
We need to move up.

4234
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:02,230
We need to move up.

4235
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:02,610
Okay.

4236
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,100
We need to take more space in zone.

4237
02:08:09,380 --> 02:08:11,120
We have a good... We need to get this house right here, okay?

4238
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:12,000
Alright.

4239
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,860
I'm heading over to you.

4240
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:14,960
Yeah, you're good.

4241
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:15,880
We get in here, we're vibing.

4242
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:17,700
Make sure we... Okay.

4243
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:20,000
Now when we're in this house, we 100% can get sent on.

4244
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:20,600
Just play slow.

4245
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:23,160
My Q takes someone behind us.

4246
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:24,060
Yeah, there's two behind me.

4247
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:24,620
There's two behind me.

4248
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:25,480
Can you cover me?

4249
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,320
Yeah, you're good.

4250
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:26,660
I'm looking for you.

4251
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:27,200
I'm looking for you, vibing.

4252
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:27,760
Okay.

4253
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:28,260
That's right.

4254
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,240
I don't wanna dive through the window.

4255
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:31,200
I'm here.

4256
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:32,800
You're good.

4257
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:33,100
You're good.

4258
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:33,300
You're good.

4259
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:33,500
You're good.

4260
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:34,900
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

4261
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:35,500
We're vibing.

4262
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:35,920
We're vibing.

4263
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:36,140
We're good.

4264
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:36,520
I'm vibing.

4265
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:36,980
I'm vibing.

4266
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:40,220
I could've Q'd, but I didn't because I had more confidence in you guys as a team.

4267
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:42,260
Oh, that was... Thank you.

4268
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:42,560
I think...

4269
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:44,700
We're good.

4270
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:48,420
I had a lot of confidence in all of you to protect me.

4271
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:48,640
I had a lot of confidence in all of you to protect me.

4272
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,000
So I never Q'd.

4273
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,840
I would definitely Q.

4274
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:53,820
Me and Teb were not good.

4275
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,900
That means I trust my homies.

4276
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:57,720
Get your homies.

4277
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:58,100
Thank you so much.

4278
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:00,160
My life is in your hands.

4279
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:01,340
That's too much.

4280
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:01,600
No pressure.

4281
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,900
I don't even know where I got shot at.

4282
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:07,940
I think we can farm you guys.

4283
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:08,420
Oh, right here.

4284
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:09,140
On Crafter.

4285
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:09,540
Okay.

4286
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:11,420
But the zone's actually not bad for us.

4287
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:12,040
We're fine right now.

4288
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:12,780
We're doing pretty good.

4289
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,380
Anyone in Big House over here at Tempo?

4290
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:15,240
Do you know?

4291
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:16,800
I'mma check.

4292
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:17,380
You guys stay there.

4293
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:19,140
Woah, now I see it.

4294
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:20,740
Now I know what you guys are talking about.

4295
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:21,420
No one's in here.

4296
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:23,160
I mean, they might be routing it, but I think they sent it.

4297
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,620
I'm gonna go in here.

4298
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:23,840
One sec.

4299
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:24,140
Just wait.

4300
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:24,440
Okay.

4301
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:25,900
We can't craft you if you die.

4302
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:26,940
I know.

4303
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:27,200
You're good.

4304
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:30,640
There's no one in here.

4305
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:30,980
Come to me.

4306
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:31,260
Come to me.

4307
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:31,540
Come to me.

4308
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:31,740
Come to me.

4309
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:31,960
Come to me.

4310
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:32,280
Okay.

4311
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:34,260
I'm gonna need that Tempo.

4312
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:35,400
Yeah, I'm gonna need you.

4313
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,120
Need what?

4314
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:37,940
You're spamming me?

4315
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:39,580
Woo!

4316
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:40,780
Am I...

4317
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:41,400
Oh!

4318
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:43,580
Oh!

4319
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:45,120
I lived!

4320
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,640
I lived!

4321
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:51,020
How does she do this?

4322
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:53,000
You're good.

4323
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
You're good.

4324
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:55,060
Take your time.

4325
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:55,540
I'm good.

4326
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:56,220
I'm okay.

4327
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:58,400
How does she fucking do it?

4328
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,020
I'm losing so many cells.

4329
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:00,420
It's crazy.

4330
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,220
I'm just gonna not peek anymore.

4331
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:01,600
I'm good.

4332
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:02,120
We're good.

4333
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:02,440
We're good.

4334
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:03,880
I'm good.

4335
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:04,520
We're all good.

4336
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:06,500
I don't know how the fuck we did it in here, but we did it, guys.

4337
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:08,860
I don't know how I lived that, but let's go.

4338
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,740
I'm very proud of you.

4339
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:11,360
Good shit, guys.

4340
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:12,340
Okay.

4341
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:13,040
Are you sent on?

4342
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:13,760
Are you team honest now?

4343
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:15,040
Underneath our house.

4344
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:15,980
Underneath us, which is fine.

4345
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:16,420
Okay.

4346
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:18,800
I put a Loba stick on the door.

4347
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,860
They're shooting my stick, but that's okay.

4348
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:23,620
I grabbed some stuff before they could.

4349
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,820
If you guys want more ammo, there's some here.

4350
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:27,200
I'm gonna screen.

4351
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:27,980
Ow.

4352
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:29,480
Tempo, we don't have enough meds.

4353
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:30,160
Don't peek too much.

4354
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:34,720
You guys can grab ammo here.

4355
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:36,500
Oh, there's 39 cells.

4356
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:37,360
Oh my god.

4357
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,120
I'm chilling out.

4358
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:39,220
Oh, I should've picked cells.

4359
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,140
I'm so stupid.

4360
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:40,920
Okay, we're good.

4361
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:41,340
We're good.

4362
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,360
Oh yeah, that's right.

4363
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:45,280
Tempo, you wanna pick?

4364
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:45,860
You wanna...

4365
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,140
do the thing?

4366
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:48,400
Yeah, one sec.

4367
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:52,400
39...

4368
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,140
33 cells is gigantic for us, guys.

4369
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:54,900
Yeah, that's so nice.

4370
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:56,940
Good fucking call on the Loba, dude.

4371
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:57,860
Top 14!

4372
02:10:58,240 --> 02:10:59,020
Top 14, guys!

4373
02:10:59,020 --> 02:10:59,020
I told you!

4374
02:10:59,020 --> 02:10:59,940
I know because we're always poor!

4375
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:01,060
Every game!

4376
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,340
We have to play Loba to have anything in life.

4377
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:07,780
Wig.

4378
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:08,820
What's up?

4379
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:11,640
Ooh, I'll take that if you don't need it.

4380
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:13,600
I grabbed the charge rifle.

4381
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:15,160
I'll put the next one here.

4382
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,040
You need a sniper ammo, buddy?

4383
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:16,800
I can give you something you need.

4384
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:18,760
I picked it all up from the thing.

4385
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:19,540
Alright, big dog.

4386
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,060
Let me not have any more.

4387
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:21,220
It's loot time.

4388
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:22,380
Loot time.

4389
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:26,820
My existence is to just sit here because I don't have any range.

4390
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,380
Yeah, you're good.

4391
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:29,480
Just the team underneath us.

4392
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,140
Make sure we don't get one.

4393
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:33,040
I'll aim at this window.

4394
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:33,760
Wait.

4395
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:34,880
They're on our roof now.

4396
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:36,320
Oh, they're on our roof.

4397
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:40,220
I feel like they might rampart our door.

4398
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:44,820
Honestly, them being on our roof is pretty good for us.

4399
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:48,600
Yeah, they're like our wall.

4400
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:51,720
How is this guy walking up if there's a team on our roof?

4401
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:52,300
How is this guy walking up if there's a team on our roof?

4402
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:53,080
They're breaching.

4403
02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:55,560
As I say, they're not gonna push us and this team just literally sits there for free.

4404
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:55,980
It's crazy.

4405
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,160
They have their priorities.

4406
02:11:58,720 --> 02:11:59,840
Oh yeah, we're locked in.

4407
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:00,680
We're so good, guys.

4408
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:02,240
We got good spots.

4409
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:03,800
Look at us.

4410
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:05,300
We're fucking killing it.

4411
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:08,140
We just need a team to die around us.

4412
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:09,700
That's what I'm saying.

4413
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:11,100
We're gonna get so much loot.

4414
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,500
We should be good for next zone.

4415
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:13,980
I'm pretty sure the next zone is gonna pull towards us.

4416
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:14,700
Yeah, me too.

4417
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:15,920
I think.

4418
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:16,500
I could be wrong.

4419
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:18,200
I'm just gonna believe in you.

4420
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:19,420
Thank you.

4421
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:20,700
That's actually the nicest thing you're saying.

4422
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,940
I've always believed in you.

4423
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,160
Thank you so much.

4424
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:30,000
Like why is YB and CC with you for seven... maybe hypothetically seven hours?

4425
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,380
Why is this guy just out in the open?

4426
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,160
Three and a half hours.

4427
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:34,480
He's just out in the open shooting.

4428
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:36,700
I don't know how he's doing that with a team on our roof.

4429
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,900
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

4430
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:38,180
I'm confused.

4431
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,240
They're not looking at him.

4432
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:42,300
That's how.

4433
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:43,480
They might push for the knockers to be honest.

4434
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:45,040
100%, yeah.

4435
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:47,420
I'm a little horny.

4436
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:52,260
How is this team on the roof not shooting these guys?

4437
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:53,500
And what's this?

4438
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:54,340
The third on our roof?

4439
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:56,680
I'm gonna grab this armor.

4440
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:59,660
And then also these shields.

4441
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,740
Oh my god bro.

4442
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:03,960
The cells are such a vibe.

4443
02:13:04,140 --> 02:13:05,040
The cells are such a vibe.

4444
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,900
Such a vibe saver.

4445
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:07,260
It's crazy.

4446
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:07,980
Good shit.

4447
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:09,320
Let us go.

4448
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:13,420
They can't kill us because we always have unlimited cells.

4449
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:16,440
This has to be his teammate that's on our roof.

4450
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:18,480
There's no way these guys are able to peek this.

4451
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:19,340
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

4452
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:19,840
Yeah.

4453
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:23,380
I mean this guy is just in the open.

4454
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:24,360
This is crazy.

4455
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:27,880
Yeah.

4456
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:28,220
If anyone wants...

4457
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:29,540
Who the hell would run Newcastle in this lobby?

4458
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:34,100
Someone that's not Geyser for POI.

4459
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:36,200
And someone that's very confident in their ability.

4460
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:36,860
Yeah.

4461
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:41,400
Oh, they took this.

4462
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:43,060
One team on RV.

4463
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:43,880
Oh, nice.

4464
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:44,520
Oh my god, he's flesh.

4465
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:47,540
That team should die.

4466
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:49,880
There's no way someone's gonna let them do that.

4467
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:51,960
Well, I think they're doing it right now.

4468
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,020
They are doing it.

4469
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:53,340
They're good.

4470
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:53,720
They're chilling.

4471
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,440
Guys, guys, guys, they're coming soon.

4472
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:58,580
Holy shit.

4473
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,160
Listen, we gotta hold it down here, guys.

4474
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:02,320
We've been top 10 before.

4475
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:06,220
Don't jinx it.

4476
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:10,980
Genuinely, if we get sent on and people are trying to push in our building, we do not contest.

4477
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:12,780
We back up here and throw grenades here.

4478
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:13,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4479
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:15,120
I'm being so serious.

4480
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:20,600
I'm so for real right now.

4481
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:21,280
I'm not even trying to be funny.

4482
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,580
I opened their door.

4483
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:26,340
Wait, wait, wait.

4484
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:27,840
Oh, they might be out.

4485
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:30,940
Does Sheila break through cat door or no?

4486
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:32,340
Yes, yes, yes.

4487
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:32,820
Really?

4488
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:36,100
Yeah, that's why I was like be careful of this door.

4489
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,540
I heard the wind up and I'm scared now.

4490
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:39,840
I heard the wind up.

4491
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:44,380
The wind up is giving me fear.

4492
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:51,300
Alright, also just keep instant dropping your low ball to wherever you get it.

4493
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:51,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4494
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:53,280
20%, 20%.

4495
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:54,760
Where's this care pack at?

4496
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:55,520
Can I scan this again?

4497
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,620
We don't need beacons.

4498
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:03,080
We don't need all those fucking ring scans.

4499
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:10,730
Oh, you end up getting a...

4500
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:12,730
Tempo actually ended up getting a charge rifle.

4501
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:14,230
It was in this room.

4502
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:15,890
We're good.

4503
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:20,050
We just got to make sure... Tempo, if you just get sent on, just like literally just walk back in.

4504
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:22,850
I have another low ball.

4505
02:15:23,610 --> 02:15:24,590
Oh, nice, nice.

4506
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:25,770
That's great.

4507
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:26,890
More people are going to die near us too.

4508
02:15:26,990 --> 02:15:27,290
This is fantastic.

4509
02:15:27,570 --> 02:15:30,310
I might actually just take grenades.

4510
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:33,110
There's a lot for...

4511
02:15:34,090 --> 02:15:34,890
I took two grenades.

4512
02:15:35,050 --> 02:15:37,430
We need them.

4513
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:38,810
Me too.

4514
02:15:39,310 --> 02:15:40,990
We're definitely not going to need anything else.

4515
02:15:41,170 --> 02:15:41,630
We should be fine.

4516
02:15:42,030 --> 02:15:44,570
You guys are just picking up the grenades that you threw down.

4517
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:47,830
Why did you pick up the grenades we dropped?

4518
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:50,510
I'm sick to my stomach, dude.

4519
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:52,510
Fuck me, man.

4520
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:56,090
That's pretty funny.

4521
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:58,150
On us, on us.

4522
02:15:58,170 --> 02:15:58,430
Watch out.

4523
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:59,550
It's a Sheila.

4524
02:15:59,770 --> 02:16:00,670
Take the door.

4525
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:01,170
Take the door.

4526
02:16:03,010 --> 02:16:03,290
Okay.

4527
02:16:06,170 --> 02:16:06,730
I'm going to...

4528
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:11,030
I'm going to collapse this.

4529
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:12,430
I'm going to look for picks here on the backside.

4530
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:13,250
Just make sure we don't get hit.

4531
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:16,370
I'm looking with you, just in case.

4532
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:16,670
We're good.

4533
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:17,510
We're vibing.

4534
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:18,850
Top 12, guys.

4535
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:20,330
Zone, are we in?

4536
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:21,010
Alright, guys.

4537
02:16:21,110 --> 02:16:21,470
Don't...

4538
02:16:22,070 --> 02:16:22,550
We're in.

4539
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:23,190
We're in this corner.

4540
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:25,150
We're playing that corner.

4541
02:16:25,250 --> 02:16:25,810
We're playing that corner.

4542
02:16:25,910 --> 02:16:28,050
We walk out late.

4543
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:30,170
We're going to show no presence once the zone closes.

4544
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:32,810
The only way they know we're here is from our low ball.

4545
02:16:32,910 --> 02:16:33,450
That's fine.

4546
02:16:33,530 --> 02:16:35,850
I need to get fucking purple, bro, for a zipline really bad.

4547
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:40,540
We got to get purple here.

4548
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:42,760
There's a guy.

4549
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:44,040
There's a Newcastle behind this wall.

4550
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:46,080
Alright, we got scanned from behind.

4551
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,600
There's a Newcastle right here behind this.

4552
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:51,360
Fuck me, bro.

4553
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:52,220
I need to get purple.

4554
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:54,860
Oh, he's rotating to the left.

4555
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:57,540
Oh, I couldn't see him in time.

4556
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:58,980
Oh, he's rotating to the left.

4557
02:16:58,980 --> 02:16:59,500
It's a little rat.

4558
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:00,540
He's a little rat guy.

4559
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,340
It's a little rat guy?

4560
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:03,280
Yeah, he's a little rat.

4561
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,540
He's ratting up there.

4562
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:10,710
I have low ball in 20.

4563
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:12,430
We're good.

4564
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:12,690
We're good.

4565
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:13,430
We're doing great.

4566
02:17:17,570 --> 02:17:18,410
We're doing great, guys.

4567
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:21,430
I need my zipline here so we take less damage on zip.

4568
02:17:21,470 --> 02:17:24,470
I need my zipline here so we take less damage on zip.

4569
02:17:24,470 --> 02:17:25,810
Fuck me, I missed the shot.

4570
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:30,190
Oh my god, let's fucking go.

4571
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:30,710
Holy shit.

4572
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:30,910
Alright.

4573
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:34,530
Oh my god, I want to shoot this guy so bad.

4574
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:37,430
I have low ball in 10.

4575
02:17:38,390 --> 02:17:38,950
Yeah, we're good.

4576
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:39,150
We're good.

4577
02:17:39,170 --> 02:17:39,570
Just keep holding.

4578
02:17:39,870 --> 02:17:41,290
Literally make sure that no one pushes this door.

4579
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:42,150
That's all we need right now.

4580
02:17:42,470 --> 02:17:43,950
Just make sure we don't get shielded in the back late.

4581
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,770
Yeah, I'm looking for you guys.

4582
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,630
We're good.

4583
02:17:46,730 --> 02:17:47,770
I'm going to keep staring here too.

4584
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:48,030
One sec.

4585
02:17:48,170 --> 02:17:50,530
I'm looking at this door just in case.

4586
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:51,190
Yeah, you guys look forward.

4587
02:17:51,590 --> 02:17:52,550
I have ult here.

4588
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:53,550
I'm going to put my ult right here.

4589
02:17:53,650 --> 02:17:54,710
I regret the decision fully.

4590
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:55,270
That guy's a beast.

4591
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:00,120
That zipline is so fast.

4592
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:01,200
Alright, I'm going to back here.

4593
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:03,460
There's a red for us here if you need it.

4594
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:04,280
Oh, nice.

4595
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:05,840
Yeah, refresh it.

4596
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:06,760
You should refresh it.

4597
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,780
It's a refresh, not an actual red.

4598
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:09,660
Yeah.

4599
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:13,500
I'm going to take batteries.

4600
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:16,140
I am going to grab...

4601
02:18:16,140 --> 02:18:16,980
Wait, do I need batteries?

4602
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:17,360
No.

4603
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:18,320
I'm going to grab AA.

4604
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:19,460
We're good.

4605
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,260
We just played that corner, guys.

4606
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:20,920
We're just going to play that corner.

4607
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:21,740
I'm going to grab an aid then.

4608
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:23,660
How in are we?

4609
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:24,280
Fighting in that room.

4610
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:25,540
Kind of.

4611
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:27,720
Tempo, you got to stay in this corner.

4612
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:28,400
We're good.

4613
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,360
We're going to zip out late game somewhere.

4614
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:31,800
We have a lot of room actually.

4615
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:34,700
Wait, are we going to die in here?

4616
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:35,920
No, no, no.

4617
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:36,200
We're good.

4618
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:36,960
We're going to walk out late.

4619
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:38,300
Okay, okay.

4620
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,760
Only one of us can peek at a time.

4621
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:42,780
I'll peek.

4622
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:43,080
I'll peek.

4623
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:43,740
Yeah, yeah.

4624
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:44,420
We will peek.

4625
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:45,240
He has the armor.

4626
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:46,000
He has one shot.

4627
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:46,980
Fuck me.

4628
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:49,460
Jump again, you little bitch.

4629
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:51,760
Guys, I have 56 health.

4630
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:52,380
56 damage.

4631
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:53,600
Nice job.

4632
02:18:56,980 --> 02:18:57,620
I'm contributing.

4633
02:18:57,960 --> 02:18:59,020
Alright, what we're going to do here, guys.

4634
02:18:59,220 --> 02:19:00,600
Can you see this little cliff here?

4635
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:01,140
Late game.

4636
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:02,480
We're going to go to this cliff here late.

4637
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:02,900
Okay?

4638
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:04,500
We're going to literally walk out left.

4639
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:05,460
We're going to walk into the front door.

4640
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,560
And we're going to go out to the other side.

4641
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:10,020
We're going to have to go pretty early though.

4642
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:11,100
Because we can't fucking get killed.

4643
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:12,680
Fucking through storm.

4644
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:13,740
I believe.

4645
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:18,080
Wait, is there a he shield?

4646
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:20,060
Because we can have that one second he shield.

4647
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,180
No, they do the tournament.

4648
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:23,500
Oh, it's tournament mode.

4649
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:26,820
We got to wait six seconds.

4650
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:28,040
We're going to go now.

4651
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,340
Go now.

4652
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:28,540
Go now.

4653
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:28,680
Go now.

4654
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:28,980
Go to the cliff.

4655
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:29,240
Go to the cliff.

4656
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:31,080
Jump to the cliff.

4657
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:31,600
Jump to the cliff side.

4658
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:32,500
Right here.

4659
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:33,400
I'm here.

4660
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:33,560
Right here.

4661
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:33,960
Come here.

4662
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:34,740
We're good.

4663
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:35,840
We're going to look left.

4664
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:36,600
We're going to look left immediately.

4665
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:37,520
Look at these kids.

4666
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:38,160
They're going to try to shoot us.

4667
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:40,180
They're going to be kids right above us too.

4668
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:40,720
We're good.

4669
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:40,900
We're good.

4670
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:41,080
We're good.

4671
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:41,700
We're so good.

4672
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:42,620
Just stare left.

4673
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:43,220
Someone stare left.

4674
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:43,680
I'm staring.

4675
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:44,040
I'm staring.

4676
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:44,380
I'm staring.

4677
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:46,080
We're going to walk in late.

4678
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,320
We can't really do much here.

4679
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,100
Oh my god.

4680
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:51,140
How is there six teams still alive?

4681
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:54,640
There's a team on my right.

4682
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:55,020
On here.

4683
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,280
I'm shooting.

4684
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:56,700
I'm shooting.

4685
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:57,700
We're good.

4686
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:57,920
We're good.

4687
02:19:58,020 --> 02:19:58,080
We're good.

4688
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:58,580
Shoot left.

4689
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:00,040
Just don't let them kill us right now.

4690
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,300
Tempo is not shooting left.

4691
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:03,080
He's doing good.

4692
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:03,400
He's doing good.

4693
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:03,520
It's fine.

4694
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:05,960
If someone walks behind us, they're idiots.

4695
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:06,500
They shouldn't.

4696
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:07,760
Yeah, I'm watching behind us.

4697
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:09,880
Look here.

4698
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:10,200
Look here.

4699
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:10,420
Look here.

4700
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:10,740
They're looking.

4701
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:11,040
They're looking.

4702
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:13,260
Yeah, they're looking.

4703
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:14,640
No, bro.

4704
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,400
Right when I said...

4705
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:15,500
I know.

4706
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:17,440
I said they're looking.

4707
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:20,020
I said they're looking.

4708
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:22,300
Why did you stop looking?

4709
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:22,420
I threw.

4710
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:22,680
I threw.

4711
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:23,080
I threw.

4712
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:23,900
I threw.

4713
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:24,740
I threw.

4714
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:25,520
I threw.

4715
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:26,200
I threw.

4716
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:27,340
Of course I threw.

4717
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:28,380
And I got wounded.

4718
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:32,080
The moment they stopped looking.

4719
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:32,960
The moment they stopped looking.

4720
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:34,600
I saw.

4721
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,460
I saw like a fucking car selfman.

4722
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:39,740
They pushed.

4723
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:39,960
They pushed.

4724
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:42,860
The timing.

4725
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:44,560
And now my camera fell.

4726
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:46,680
Now my camera's on the floor.

4727
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:49,460
My whole setup just fell.

4728
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:52,020
Bro, wait.

4729
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:54,520
I think today's just not your day.

4730
02:20:54,940 --> 02:20:57,280
I think today's just not your day.

4731
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:58,180
Oh my god.

4732
02:20:58,200 --> 02:20:59,020
He died to me.

4733
02:21:06,010 --> 02:21:07,130
Oh man.

4734
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:13,050
Guys, it's okay.

4735
02:21:13,170 --> 02:21:14,590
We got six guys.

4736
02:21:14,730 --> 02:21:15,690
That's a lot of points.

4737
02:21:17,130 --> 02:21:17,650
That's a lot of points.

4738
02:21:17,650 --> 02:21:18,670
Oh, what are the points?

4739
02:21:19,290 --> 02:21:20,570
That's... and we got six.

4740
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:23,290
We got six guys.

4741
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:23,950
Nice roll, guys.

4742
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:28,830
Guys, you fucking threw that, man.

4743
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:33,790
I'm sick to my stomach, dude.

4744
02:21:34,030 --> 02:21:34,910
Okay, we're back.

4745
02:21:36,110 --> 02:21:37,530
We were back.

4746
02:21:37,530 --> 02:21:40,230
I have to go pee like every 15 minutes.

4747
02:21:40,450 --> 02:21:40,730
Why?

4748
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:41,210
What's...

4749
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:42,170
That's not healthy.

4750
02:21:42,430 --> 02:21:43,210
That's not healthy.

4751
02:21:43,470 --> 02:21:44,110
That's not healthy at all.

4752
02:21:44,310 --> 02:21:45,750
There might be something wrong.

4753
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:46,630
I'm on a bunch of energy drinks.

4754
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:47,790
I just have to keep peeing.

4755
02:21:48,210 --> 02:21:48,690
What?

4756
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:50,950
God.

4757
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:51,290
What?

4758
02:21:51,490 --> 02:21:54,150
Bro, you must be super dehydrated.

4759
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:54,930
That is not healthy.

4760
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:56,810
Top six is not bad.

4761
02:21:56,890 --> 02:21:57,690
How did I not get one?

4762
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,370
Top six is pretty decent.

4763
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:00,750
That's eight points.

4764
02:22:00,850 --> 02:22:01,670
We're at eight now.

4765
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:03,970
Yay, eight points!

4766
02:22:04,510 --> 02:22:04,990
Yay!

4767
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:06,830
We got eight points in total.

4768
02:22:07,630 --> 02:22:08,710
Wait, how do you...

4769
02:22:08,710 --> 02:22:10,430
Wait, you are ass.

4770
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:12,370
Ban him!

4771
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:13,590
Ban him!

4772
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:14,710
Why?

4773
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:16,110
What did I do to knock?

4774
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:19,780
Do it!

4775
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:20,380
No buzz!

4776
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,400
What did I do to knock, bro?

4777
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:23,960
Okay.

4778
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:25,980
Where's Greek?

4779
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:27,160
Okay, Greek is team 14.

4780
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:28,600
Team 14.

4781
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:31,240
Team 14 got 19 plays with zero kills!

4782
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:31,960
Team 14 got 19 plays with zero kills!

4783
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:33,740
So, they're actually last last!

4784
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:36,280
Oh my god, they're probably molding right now.

4785
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:36,820
I'm so happy.

4786
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:37,320
Oh my god, they're probably molding right now.

4787
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:37,320
I'm so happy.

4788
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:38,640
Bro, they're actually last last!

4789
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:39,800
We're not last!

4790
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:41,460
Because we got points with placements!

4791
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:43,420
That's so good for us, dude.

4792
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:44,140
Yeah.

4793
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:46,800
No fucking box right now, TT.

4794
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,600
My whole camera service is fucked.

4795
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:52,560
This is crazy, dude.

4796
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:54,360
Alright, new goal.

4797
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:55,020
Not last.

4798
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:55,980
That's my new goal.

4799
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:57,720
That wasn't last.

4800
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:58,100
We did it.

4801
02:22:58,280 --> 02:22:58,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4802
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,400
We got it.

4803
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:00,120
We got it.

4804
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:05,160
As long as Greek's team does not have a winning game, we're fine.

4805
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:06,640
I'm saying.

4806
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,160
That's why I really care about them.

4807
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:09,800
Yeah.

4808
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,560
Is them not winning?

4809
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:16,760
Your roommate doesn't win at all.

4810
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:18,900
Is that what you want?

4811
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:19,540
I can't explain to you.

4812
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:20,980
I can't explain to you.

4813
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:23,280
Right when I looked away, they pushed.

4814
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:24,680
Yeah, I know.

4815
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:25,920
I was like, where did you go?

4816
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:28,240
I looked back and you were gone.

4817
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:29,840
I fucked it up so bad.

4818
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:32,260
I was like, where did you go?

4819
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,160
Where did my other person go?

4820
02:23:36,260 --> 02:23:38,780
And he said this is the only angle that matters.

4821
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:42,200
And then I immediately just looked.

4822
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:45,160
Right when I said that.

4823
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:45,760
That is insane.

4824
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:50,560
I completely blacked out because I just saw a full three man in the back.

4825
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:52,060
I did like 800 damage to him too.

4826
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:52,700
That was crazy.

4827
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:54,860
I got too horny.

4828
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:55,480
I just wanted this.

4829
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:57,160
Alright, Wishes, top six.

4830
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:58,080
Next one's top five.

4831
02:23:58,120 --> 02:23:58,260
Yeah?

4832
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:00,660
Is that how math works?

4833
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:01,420
Next one's top five?

4834
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:03,480
Yeah.

4835
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:04,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4836
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:05,740
We got this.

4837
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:07,100
Okay.

4838
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:09,980
Command center with Snipes team.

4839
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:11,080
Jurassic is open.

4840
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,200
There's two teams contesting Stormcatcher.

4841
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:14,980
Jurassic's terrible, bro.

4842
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:16,880
So do we want Jurassic bald?

4843
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,200
Oh my god, Jurassic's so bad.

4844
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:24,580
Isn't like Jurassic like way worse loot than anywhere else we can go?

4845
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:29,100
But on this map that I googled, on this map that I googled, it has a beacon.

4846
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,940
That means we get a beacon.

4847
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:33,760
So we're not contesting that Jurassic if we go there.

4848
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:34,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4849
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:37,740
Because somehow we still didn't have a beacon at Geyser.

4850
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:38,500
Let's do it.

4851
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:39,000
Let's do it.

4852
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:39,360
Let's do it.

4853
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:40,200
Alright.

4854
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:43,760
If we go Jurassic and there's a beacon at command center?

4855
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,360
Well, no.

4856
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:46,880
There's a team command center too.

4857
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:47,820
Yeah, that's fair.

4858
02:24:47,940 --> 02:24:48,480
Okay, so Jurassic.

4859
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:49,520
No, no, no, no.

4860
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:53,200
Wait, wait.

4861
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:57,180
What?

4862
02:24:57,180 --> 02:24:58,820
What happened?

4863
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:02,460
I was gonna do the same thing.

4864
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,660
Can we?

4865
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:05,660
Is there a crafter at Jurassic?

4866
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:08,700
I mean, Temba, we got nothing out of you doing that.

4867
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:10,180
Yeah, we got beacon.

4868
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:13,860
I still scanned Harvester's beacon when I ran back.

4869
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:15,600
But if we have beacon here, we don't need it.

4870
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:17,160
So let's see first.

4871
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:18,140
Alright, alright.

4872
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:18,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4873
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:23,300
And then if not, I'll go third Stormcatcher, scan beacon, and then die.

4874
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:25,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, because we have crafter.

4875
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:25,880
We have crafter.

4876
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:28,060
Yeah, and two teams are contesting as Stormcatcher.

4877
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:28,600
So we're good.

4878
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:29,600
It's the exact same plan.

4879
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:30,200
Yep.

4880
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:31,260
This is it.

4881
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:32,840
Yep.

4882
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:33,480
Okay, wait.

4883
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:33,820
Okay.

4884
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:35,100
So what are the legends?

4885
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:37,680
What are the legends that are...

4886
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:39,000
Wait.

4887
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:40,300
Because like...

4888
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:44,380
our strategy also relies on what legends we can play, too.

4889
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:46,580
I'm locked in.

4890
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:52,760
No, I think like letting Temba be free actually made our gameplay so much better.

4891
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:53,500
I think so, too.

4892
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:54,800
I didn't have to worry about him.

4893
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:56,120
Yeah, we don't have to worry about him.

4894
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:59,160
We just have to let him... we just have to free him, then roam around.

4895
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:01,560
Then do what he wants to do.

4896
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:03,840
Oh, man.

4897
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:06,640
It's okay, guys.

4898
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:07,480
We're not last.

4899
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:08,520
We are.

4900
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:12,980
Okay, so GoTrivalz is raiding and also just giving 25 subs to whoever, a random streamer that's involved.

4901
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:13,460
That's pretty cool.

4902
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,000
Oh!

4903
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:17,500
Ballistic Wraith Rev Valk Cat Mirage.

4904
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:19,740
Okay, so clearly Wake should play Valk.

4905
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:21,440
Oh no wait, there's a Fuse in there too.

4906
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:22,580
Clearly Wake!

4907
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:31,200
I think a unanimous decision for the squad is that Tempo's not on Valks.

4908
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:31,680
Yes.

4909
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:32,480
Yes.

4910
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:36,040
The moment Tempo was on Valk, we got 20th!

4911
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:37,740
You're so right, you're so right.

4912
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:42,120
Okay, and then Tempo will play Catalyst, right?

4913
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:44,660
And then I'll be Mirage for the crafting.

4914
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:50,840
I think... you're playing Mirage, Foggy?

4915
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:52,540
Or should I play Fuse?

4916
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:53,080
We need the craft though!

4917
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:53,640
No!

4918
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,240
No, you're right, you're right.

4919
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:57,380
Are you comfortable on Mirage?

4920
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:59,160
Oh yeah, I'm very comfortable on Mirage.

4921
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:00,960
Why are you so comfortable?

4922
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:01,860
I do not believe her.

4923
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:04,080
Why do I not trust what she's saying?

4924
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:06,140
I'm so comfortable.

4925
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:07,800
Oh yeah, I'm comfortable.

4926
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:09,600
I'm so comfortable on Mirage.

4927
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:10,500
Oh yeah, I'm so comfortable.

4928
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:10,580
Don't worry.

4929
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:13,140
Don't worry.

4930
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:16,160
When you see my banner, you'll understand.

4931
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:20,140
It also has zero kills?

4932
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:20,960
No!

4933
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:23,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4934
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:26,720
Look at my Season 5 win.

4935
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,260
That was like three years ago.

4936
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:36,120
I'm so comfortable on Mirage when it was Season 5.

4937
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:37,340
When it was...

4938
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:40,840
Season 5?

4939
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,180
Season 21?

4940
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,540
Check my Mirage.

4941
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:45,740
Yup.

4942
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:46,940
Check it.

4943
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:48,740
I'll check it when we go in the...

4944
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:48,940
Check it.

4945
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:52,500
I'm actually so mad at myself it's unbelievable that I looked away.

4946
02:27:56,220 --> 02:27:57,300
What is wrong with me?

4947
02:27:57,300 --> 02:27:57,920
What am I doing?

4948
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:02,320
I can't blame Tempo.

4949
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:03,480
You know, I can't blame him.

4950
02:28:03,740 --> 02:28:04,220
No, you can't.

4951
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:04,780
You can't blame him.

4952
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:06,420
What happened?

4953
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:07,840
Yeah, me looking away.

4954
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,760
I fucked up, you know what I mean?

4955
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:10,920
I got too horny.

4956
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,300
I just got way too horny for the squad.

4957
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:12,860
I saw Red.

4958
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:16,900
Woah, what the fuck?

4959
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:17,520
You're like...

4960
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:18,960
Your mic.

4961
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:19,940
What the fuck?

4962
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:22,300
Oh no, it's all going downhill.

4963
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:25,140
It's all going downhill.

4964
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:28,180
Oh my god.

4965
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:33,440
I still don't know why Nob called me ass.

4966
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:38,360
Did you check my Mirage stats?

4967
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:39,360
Oh, there we go.

4968
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:40,560
No, are you live right now?

4969
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:41,580
No, check that.

4970
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:42,900
Just press F.

4971
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,220
What?

4972
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:45,820
F.

4973
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,180
I've never seen that before.

4974
02:28:47,740 --> 02:28:50,640
Oh my god, you have 3600 kills?

4975
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:55,220
I do have so many Mirages.

4976
02:28:55,480 --> 02:28:56,380
Look at my wins.

4977
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:57,600
Wait, what's Mirage's thing?

4978
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:58,880
Look at my wins.

4979
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:04,240
I can't believe you played that character that much.

4980
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:11,060
Only in Season 5 and then I never touched Mirage again.

4981
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:17,160
I was on the Mirage leader points for Season 5.

4982
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:19,860
Oh my god.

4983
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:20,720
I was.

4984
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:21,720
I was.

4985
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:27,240
I had the most... I was like top 10 Mirage players because of my Mirage wins.

4986
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:31,600
I was like number one in Canada because I had the most Mirage wins in Season 5.

4987
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,880
Who the fuck are you?

4988
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:36,800
Why are you moving?

4989
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,540
I had the most Mirage wins in Canada in Season 5.

4990
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:40,680
Because I had the most Mirage wins.

4991
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:44,480
It's legit.

4992
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:48,760
I remember because I thought it was so funny when I looked at the leaderboards.

4993
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:54,000
I mean, you being top in Mirage wins is pretty fucking funny to me.

4994
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:56,500
I'm expecting a carry.

4995
02:29:57,060 --> 02:29:58,300
A Mirage carry.

4996
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:00,640
In Canada.

4997
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:05,840
The score is updated.

4998
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:07,280
One sec, I'll be right back real quick.

4999
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:08,660
It's not updated.

5000
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:11,960
That's right.

5001
02:30:12,140 --> 02:30:13,340
Number one in Canada.

5002
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:14,740
That's all that matters.

5003
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:17,440
I was top 10 in the world for Mirage wins.

5004
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:20,100
We're in 18th.

5005
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:22,280
Guys, we're doing it!

5006
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:23,900
We're doing it.

5007
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:28,220
Alright, we need to get to top 10, ok?

5008
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,880
Ok, I just want...

5009
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:34,500
If we get 17th or 16th, I'd be happy.

5010
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:35,300
That's really it.

5011
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:38,620
No, we need to get around top 10.

5012
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:43,160
This is sort of telling me how it's going to be in CC right now.

5013
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:45,940
I'm sort of having a feeling where we're at at CC.

5014
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,760
Hey, CC will be much easier.

5015
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:49,560
I'm back, how we looking?

5016
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,980
CC people actually scrim.

5017
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:53,720
CC will be easier.

5018
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:53,840
Oh I think CC does it easier.

5019
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:56,960
People in CC actually scrim!

5020
02:30:57,580 --> 02:30:59,740
I think Tebow is right, I think CC does it.

5021
02:30:59,740 --> 02:31:01,840
They shoot like they're not playing with a mouse.

5022
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:04,000
Yeah, like Doki, you're going to tap strafe on kids.

5023
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:06,440
I'm going to tap strafe on kids.

5024
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:10,640
They're going to pull from a daycare and do a Super Glide.

5025
02:31:10,900 --> 02:31:11,320
Yep.

5026
02:31:12,760 --> 02:31:13,920
On the play sets.

5027
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:15,500
Oh my god.

5028
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:20,140
In challenge circuit, even I should be able to 1v3 some teams.

5029
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:20,560
You know what I'm saying?

5030
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,200
That's the vibe that I have.

5031
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:24,940
Do I have the confidence to do so?

5032
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:25,140
No.

5033
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:27,400
Yes.

5034
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:28,500
This is our warm up.

5035
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,440
This is it.

5036
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:34,680
Hey, remember, Jurassic, if there's no beacon, I'm gonna go third stormcatcher.

5037
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:36,160
Alright.

5038
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:36,840
And steal their beacon.

5039
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:41,720
Yeah, I mean, for some reason, this is like an actual unbelievable strat we're doing and it's working.

5040
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:45,500
So, we just got top six with you landing Harvester and us landing Geyser.

5041
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:48,160
I'm not really sure I've ever seen that strat before in any level of Apex Legends.

5042
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:49,320
My mom's calling me.

5043
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:49,660
One second.

5044
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,160
Yeah, what's up, mom?

5045
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,500
Hey, mom!

5046
02:31:55,540 --> 02:31:55,980
Mom.

5047
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:56,360
Hi, mom.

5048
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:57,840
Doki says hi.

5049
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:58,360
What'd you say?

5050
02:31:58,540 --> 02:31:59,040
Hey, mom.

5051
02:32:00,520 --> 02:32:02,660
You think I'm better than your son?

5052
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:07,560
Doki wonders if you think she's better than me at Apex.

5053
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:13,240
I don't know.

5054
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:16,340
I don't know.

5055
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:18,640
Bro, she doesn't even feel like...

5056
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:28,220
Bro, I'm the best thing that's ever happened!

5057
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,600
She's awful.

5058
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:32,800
No, no, no, no.

5059
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:33,380
What?

5060
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,620
Well, now you have to come to land.

5061
02:32:35,860 --> 02:32:38,740
I'm the best thing that ever happened to Apex.

5062
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:39,360
Alright, we're in game.

5063
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:40,120
I love y'all.

5064
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:42,700
Yup, yup, yup.

5065
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:44,440
Bye, mom.

5066
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:44,740
Love you.

5067
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:45,120
Oh, my God.

5068
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,320
I got the... Mom, I love you.

5069
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:47,440
Wait, who am I playing?

5070
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:47,820
Who am I playing?

5071
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:48,140
Who am I playing?

5072
02:32:48,220 --> 02:32:49,040
You're playing Valk.

5073
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:50,280
Of course you're playing Valk.

5074
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:51,360
I'm Kat.

5075
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:53,020
I'm Mirage.

5076
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:53,920
Where's Valk?

5077
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,660
Valk is top right.

5078
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:58,980
I knew it.

5079
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:00,720
I knew I was special.

5080
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:04,720
Alright,

5081
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:11,860
let's lock it in.

5082
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:14,040
Yeah, we got this.

5083
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:15,260
Yeah, I got this.

5084
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:16,300
Tempo's not on.

5085
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:18,420
I'm the character that I'm on, which is great.

5086
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:18,820
Yeah.

5087
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:20,460
Look at it!

5088
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:20,920
Look at it!

5089
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:23,460
409 Season 5 Apex wins!

5090
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:23,940
Why is it gold?

5091
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:26,700
Why is it like so... so like...

5092
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:29,460
Yo, we have beacon and command center doesn't it?

5093
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,640
Okay, then you have to land on it with us.

5094
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:32,720
We're so good.

5095
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:32,940
Yeah.

5096
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:35,720
Now you actually land with us.

5097
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:36,980
Wait, can we... we can't...

5098
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:39,520
We can't do the double scan thing, right?

5099
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:40,840
No, it doesn't work.

5100
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:42,460
You can scan right now and then scan afterwards too.

5101
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:45,280
I mean, there's no point in scanning now and then.

5102
02:33:45,980 --> 02:33:46,680
We just wait.

5103
02:33:46,780 --> 02:33:47,880
Yeah, yeah, you just gotta wait.

5104
02:33:47,900 --> 02:33:50,040
I'm just gonna land here, I guess.

5105
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,040
Sure, buddy.

5106
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:55,680
Wait, why is that team right above us seem very close?

5107
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:56,700
Wait, what?

5108
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:57,300
Where?

5109
02:33:58,440 --> 02:33:58,820
What?

5110
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:02,740
That's not my decoy, by the way, because I forgot to use my decoy.

5111
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:03,260
Mirage player.

5112
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,460
You should have sent it at Echoey's curious time.

5113
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:07,040
Yeah, that's true.

5114
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:09,340
You should have just fucking scared somebody.

5115
02:34:09,620 --> 02:34:10,700
Just send them all into command.

5116
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:12,180
Good game last game though, guys.

5117
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:13,020
Actually, like really good job.

5118
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:13,420
Yeah, yeah.

5119
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:14,720
The little pig was...

5120
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:18,560
The little pig was definitely the thing to do.

5121
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:19,580
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

5122
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:20,040
Good job.

5123
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:20,840
Proud of you.

5124
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,580
Yeah, no problem.

5125
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:24,100
Oh my god.

5126
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:25,880
I have my heirloom too.

5127
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:27,060
Oh, nice.

5128
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:27,480
Yeah.

5129
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:30,440
This is one of those heirlooms I actually paid money for.

5130
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,280
Do you like that heirloom?

5131
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:37,920
Yes, I think the Marge statue is like one of the best heirlooms they have.

5132
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:39,380
Solid.

5133
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,640
Yeah, like I love the animations on it.

5134
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:44,880
Uh oh.

5135
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,520
I heavily relate to Marge.

5136
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:50,100
You love yourself that much?

5137
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:52,840
I have a great story.

5138
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:54,220
I carry the statue around.

5139
02:34:54,480 --> 02:34:55,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5140
02:34:57,820 --> 02:34:58,980
Actual goals, you know?

5141
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:00,540
Yeah, 100%.

5142
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,680
Tabo, hit that beacon, baby.

5143
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:02,400
Let's see where we're going.

5144
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:04,740
Don't forget I have alcohol to your suit.

5145
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:05,720
Did you loot this already?

5146
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:07,940
You loot this house?

5147
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,480
I did, yeah.

5148
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:10,020
Oh, okay.

5149
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:10,760
I'm going back then.

5150
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:11,820
You're good.

5151
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:13,020
I'm going to hit this...

5152
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:15,200
Oh, we can get a good spot now.

5153
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:16,480
We can get a good spot, guys.

5154
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:16,900
Okay.

5155
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:23,220
I'm going to immediately hit this goddamn old DxL and we're going to get going.

5156
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:24,420
Okay, we're going to start moving to the far one.

5157
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:26,500
Okay, guys.

5158
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:26,920
Deal?

5159
02:35:27,060 --> 02:35:27,660
Alright, I'm here.

5160
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:29,080
Through here, right?

5161
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:29,780
You guys are coming back this way?

5162
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:31,320
Yeah, I'm going to come back to you.

5163
02:35:31,400 --> 02:35:33,080
There's a disruptor here with an alternator.

5164
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:34,500
Oh, shit.

5165
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:35,820
That's probably the better one I have.

5166
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:36,060
It's okay.

5167
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:36,460
No big deal.

5168
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:36,940
Oh, okay.

5169
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:38,620
I could have got back.

5170
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:39,160
No, no, no.

5171
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:40,220
It's right below you.

5172
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:41,320
It's right below you.

5173
02:35:41,660 --> 02:35:42,180
Oh, really?

5174
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:42,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5175
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:44,220
Where?

5176
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:44,880
Oh, down here?

5177
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:45,280
Yeah.

5178
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:46,780
It's next to an alternator.

5179
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:47,900
Oh, shit.

5180
02:35:47,960 --> 02:35:48,300
Yeah, you're right.

5181
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:48,720
What the fuck?

5182
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,920
Yeah, I told you.

5183
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:50,860
Oh, my God.

5184
02:35:50,940 --> 02:35:51,740
That's fucking coded.

5185
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:52,260
Thank you.

5186
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:53,200
See?

5187
02:35:54,180 --> 02:35:55,280
I'm a good person.

5188
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:56,660
Yeah, sure.

5189
02:35:56,820 --> 02:35:57,400
Alright, I was kidding.

5190
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:58,560
Whoa!

5191
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:00,840
I'm going to have ulti in a little bit.

5192
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:02,920
We're going to probably ulti first, then evac.

5193
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:06,400
We want to get... for this zone, I think we want to get one of these two houses back here.

5194
02:36:06,520 --> 02:36:06,820
Oh, yeah.

5195
02:36:07,340 --> 02:36:08,040
If it's open.

5196
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:08,780
We're going to keep moving up.

5197
02:36:08,780 --> 02:36:10,720
We're going to go through power one a little bit more, then we're going to back ulti right here.

5198
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:11,480
Up top.

5199
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:13,940
I don't know how far we can actually go, though.

5200
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:17,060
I'm right behind you.

5201
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:18,040
I still need to see a...

5202
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:21,220
Like a scope.

5203
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:24,860
We need like one more.

5204
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:25,720
Yeah, I have zero scope.

5205
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:27,340
Wait, we can grab this thing, right?

5206
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,180
Yeah, we have to grab the...

5207
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:28,660
Yeah.

5208
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:29,020
Yeah.

5209
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:30,500
We'll definitely do that.

5210
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,200
We need that red band.

5211
02:36:32,120 --> 02:36:33,000
You need purple energy?

5212
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:34,960
Purple?

5213
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:35,440
Yeah, I do.

5214
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:35,600
I do.

5215
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:37,600
Nice.

5216
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:41,200
You didn't even have energy again.

5217
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:43,040
Wait, I don't even see this looted.

5218
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:45,780
In an ulti, call it reduce.

5219
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,200
I was revived with health.

5220
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:47,560
Okay.

5221
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:49,000
Yeah, I was revived with health.

5222
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:50,680
There's a pack on our right.

5223
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:51,940
Did we want to stop for that or no?

5224
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:52,940
No, I think we just keep going.

5225
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:54,240
No, I think we have to get a zone.

5226
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:56,040
Someone definitely landed here, though.

5227
02:36:56,060 --> 02:36:56,980
Yeah, they definitely did.

5228
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:57,960
Called it, yeah.

5229
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:58,320
Don't worry.

5230
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:00,580
My mirage clone will distract them.

5231
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:01,460
Good shit.

5232
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,080
We're going to try to get the left side tree and ulti over, okay?

5233
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:05,280
I keep forgetting to scan packs, bro.

5234
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:06,320
I think you remember to do that.

5235
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:08,640
It's a fucking gold master.

5236
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:08,760
It's a fucking gold master.

5237
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:09,020
I found it.

5238
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:09,880
We need that shit in this one.

5239
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:10,540
Yeah, it's fine.

5240
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,500
We're going to go to tree, then ulti over.

5241
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:15,900
My god, I have two, four, I have five nades.

5242
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:17,360
What the fuck am I going to do with five nades?

5243
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:19,800
I don't know.

5244
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:20,340
Throw them?

5245
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:22,140
I don't know.

5246
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:23,200
We have to live long enough for that.

5247
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:28,220
The chances of you throwing five is pretty crazy.

5248
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:29,560
All right, ready?

5249
02:37:31,460 --> 02:37:33,740
Oh my god, we're so... wouldn't it be funny if you guys shot?

5250
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:36,000
We would have been so far out.

5251
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:38,000
That would be so funny.

5252
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,080
He got shot.

5253
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:41,660
I feel like Teppo is still running.

5254
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:45,560
This could be the end of us or the start of us.

5255
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:45,960
Yes, sir.

5256
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:46,400
Velko.

5257
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:49,260
All right, we're going to try to go back side.

5258
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:50,300
Just let me know if you see anyone.

5259
02:37:50,380 --> 02:37:51,200
We're going for this building back here.

5260
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,560
Well, there's obviously somebody there.

5261
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:54,320
No, I'm the building in the back.

5262
02:37:55,580 --> 02:37:56,140
Yep, there is.

5263
02:37:56,340 --> 02:37:56,620
There is.

5264
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:56,620
There is.

5265
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:57,020
Oh, there is.

5266
02:37:57,020 --> 02:37:57,660
There is.

5267
02:37:58,040 --> 02:37:58,420
There is.

5268
02:37:58,420 --> 02:37:58,600
There is.

5269
02:37:58,660 --> 02:37:58,960
There is.

5270
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:00,460
We're going to go back to the terrace.

5271
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:00,820
We're good.

5272
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:01,020
We're good.

5273
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:01,300
We're good here.

5274
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:01,940
All right.

5275
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:02,980
We're valid.

5276
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:04,140
This is so easy to play.

5277
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:04,760
We're chilling.

5278
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:05,760
Fucking... Oh my god.

5279
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:07,620
Oh, you're good.

5280
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:07,980
You're good.

5281
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:08,780
I'm so good.

5282
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:09,260
Shut up.

5283
02:38:09,260 --> 02:38:09,740
We're using shit.

5284
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:09,980
We're chilling.

5285
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:14,860
We're so good.

5286
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:16,060
Behind us?

5287
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:17,740
Yeah, like driving behind.

5288
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:18,540
In the open.

5289
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:20,300
I want to open this bin.

5290
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:25,180
Let's see.

5291
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:26,980
Teppo, honest question.

5292
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:27,580
Ready?

5293
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:28,660
Like giving your input.

5294
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:31,280
Do you think that this tunnel is better for us or staying on staircase is better?

5295
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:33,280
I honestly have no idea.

5296
02:38:34,300 --> 02:38:34,700
Ideal.

5297
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:35,700
It's up to you, ideal.

5298
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:36,900
Zero idea.

5299
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:38,180
I think we're going to stay here to be honest.

5300
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:38,500
Okay.

5301
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:42,160
Can I be playing tunnel without a fucking like actual good defensive character other than Teppo?

5302
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:42,840
I think I was pretty sure.

5303
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:44,880
I have like 18 nades for some reason.

5304
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,160
All right.

5305
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:47,920
I have like two syringes.

5306
02:38:47,980 --> 02:38:49,640
I haven't found single syringes anywhere.

5307
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:54,010
You bitch, bro.

5308
02:38:54,050 --> 02:38:54,510
Don't shoot me.

5309
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:54,830
What?

5310
02:38:54,870 --> 02:38:55,730
Wait, my game lagged.

5311
02:38:55,890 --> 02:38:56,410
Wait, what?

5312
02:38:56,810 --> 02:38:57,390
Behind us.

5313
02:38:57,430 --> 02:38:57,810
Behind us.

5314
02:38:57,870 --> 02:38:57,870
Behind us.

5315
02:38:57,970 --> 02:38:57,990
Behind us.

5316
02:38:58,230 --> 02:38:59,150
I have a glitch.

5317
02:38:59,170 --> 02:38:59,590
I have a glitch.

5318
02:38:59,590 --> 02:38:59,970
I have a glitch.

5319
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:00,450
Behind us.

5320
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:00,710
Behind us.

5321
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:00,910
Behind us.

5322
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:01,210
Behind us.

5323
02:39:01,210 --> 02:39:01,490
Okay.

5324
02:39:01,550 --> 02:39:01,790
Okay.

5325
02:39:01,790 --> 02:39:01,950
Okay.

5326
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:03,370
I can't heal.

5327
02:39:03,850 --> 02:39:04,810
I literally can't heal.

5328
02:39:04,830 --> 02:39:05,190
I have a glitch.

5329
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:06,290
Wait, what?

5330
02:39:06,950 --> 02:39:08,650
Every time I heal, my screen goes black.

5331
02:39:08,670 --> 02:39:09,270
Guys, come back to me.

5332
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:09,590
Come back to me.

5333
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:09,790
Okay.

5334
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:10,050
Okay.

5335
02:39:10,150 --> 02:39:10,310
Okay.

5336
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:10,710
I'm here.

5337
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:10,930
I'm here.

5338
02:39:11,130 --> 02:39:13,330
I just threw 18 nades at them because...

5339
02:39:13,330 --> 02:39:14,030
Yeah, you're good.

5340
02:39:14,070 --> 02:39:14,190
You're good.

5341
02:39:14,190 --> 02:39:14,710
My game is fucked.

5342
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:15,390
You have to play slow.

5343
02:39:15,570 --> 02:39:15,850
Okay.

5344
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:16,150
Okay.

5345
02:39:16,190 --> 02:39:16,350
Okay.

5346
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:17,410
So you can't do that at all?

5347
02:39:17,530 --> 02:39:18,430
I would have come back in.

5348
02:39:18,530 --> 02:39:20,370
In my deal, it shows like a...

5349
02:39:22,410 --> 02:39:23,350
Are you cheating?

5350
02:39:23,710 --> 02:39:24,030
Destroyer?

5351
02:39:24,030 --> 02:39:25,030
No, an arm in my face.

5352
02:39:25,090 --> 02:39:26,250
I have a whole arm in my face.

5353
02:39:26,310 --> 02:39:27,570
You have a whole arm?

5354
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:27,990
Wait.

5355
02:39:28,730 --> 02:39:31,450
But you still can't heal, but you just... it's just a visual bug.

5356
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:32,870
I can't see anything in my heal.

5357
02:39:32,910 --> 02:39:33,090
Yeah.

5358
02:39:33,210 --> 02:39:33,610
Oh, okay.

5359
02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:33,910
Okay.

5360
02:39:36,210 --> 02:39:36,690
I'm hiding.

5361
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:37,630
My whole chat's been caught.

5362
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:39,430
Oh, no.

5363
02:39:39,470 --> 02:39:39,750
Destroyer.

5364
02:39:39,750 --> 02:39:40,050
You're cheating.

5365
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:40,670
I'm cheating.

5366
02:39:40,770 --> 02:39:41,150
I'm cheating.

5367
02:39:41,350 --> 02:39:41,670
Destroyer.

5368
02:39:44,210 --> 02:39:44,850
Destroyer's here, baby.

5369
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:47,330
Destroyer.

5370
02:39:47,370 --> 02:39:47,770
Don't worry.

5371
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:49,010
How's in our tournament?

5372
02:39:49,750 --> 02:39:50,110
Destroyer.

5373
02:39:50,530 --> 02:39:50,890
Yeah.

5374
02:39:50,910 --> 02:39:51,230
Why me?

5375
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:51,570
Why me?

5376
02:39:51,770 --> 02:39:52,130
Yeah.

5377
02:39:52,170 --> 02:39:53,810
He has like so many people watching him.

5378
02:39:54,810 --> 02:39:55,170
Yeah.

5379
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:56,150
Exactly.

5380
02:39:56,450 --> 02:39:57,210
Why me, man?

5381
02:39:57,410 --> 02:39:57,770
Yeah.

5382
02:39:58,190 --> 02:39:58,950
You want publicity?

5383
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,710
Go for hell.

5384
02:40:00,430 --> 02:40:00,790
Yeah.

5385
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:01,450
You'll get it.

5386
02:40:01,530 --> 02:40:01,790
Yeah.

5387
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:02,830
You'll get all that publicity.

5388
02:40:03,270 --> 02:40:03,990
So many tweets.

5389
02:40:04,150 --> 02:40:04,830
So many tweets.

5390
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:04,890
Yeah.

5391
02:40:04,890 --> 02:40:05,430
So many engagement.

5392
02:40:05,630 --> 02:40:07,070
Think of the engagement, Destroyer.

5393
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:07,450
Oh, my God.

5394
02:40:07,450 --> 02:40:08,090
The impressions.

5395
02:40:08,190 --> 02:40:08,550
The impressions.

5396
02:40:08,550 --> 02:40:08,690
Yeah.

5397
02:40:08,690 --> 02:40:09,370
The impressions.

5398
02:40:09,430 --> 02:40:10,130
Oh, my God.

5399
02:40:10,210 --> 02:40:11,030
All the impressions.

5400
02:40:11,270 --> 02:40:12,790
I don't think I want to peek anymore, guys.

5401
02:40:12,790 --> 02:40:13,670
I don't have a lot of heels.

5402
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:16,710
Good idea.

5403
02:40:16,810 --> 02:40:17,050
Wait.

5404
02:40:17,090 --> 02:40:17,390
Landing?

5405
02:40:17,650 --> 02:40:17,970
Landing.

5406
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:18,230
Landing.

5407
02:40:18,310 --> 02:40:18,410
Landing.

5408
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:18,830
Tunnel.

5409
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:19,170
Tunnel.

5410
02:40:19,170 --> 02:40:19,330
Tunnel.

5411
02:40:19,410 --> 02:40:19,410
Tunnel.

5412
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:23,270
Cracked one.

5413
02:40:24,310 --> 02:40:26,030
How are you guys peeking in?

5414
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:27,850
Oh, boy.

5415
02:40:28,250 --> 02:40:28,990
Did we get chopper?

5416
02:40:29,070 --> 02:40:29,270
Where?

5417
02:40:29,890 --> 02:40:30,330
The left.

5418
02:40:30,430 --> 02:40:30,910
The right side.

5419
02:40:31,610 --> 02:40:32,090
Oh, okay.

5420
02:40:32,150 --> 02:40:33,110
They're going to be on silo.

5421
02:40:33,150 --> 02:40:33,650
They have to watch out.

5422
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:33,990
Yeah.

5423
02:40:34,310 --> 02:40:35,750
I'm just going to stay down here in the stairs.

5424
02:40:36,350 --> 02:40:36,670
Yeah.

5425
02:40:36,710 --> 02:40:36,910
You're good.

5426
02:40:36,970 --> 02:40:38,510
I'm going to show a little prep so we don't get sent on.

5427
02:40:38,890 --> 02:40:40,270
My fucking Mirage clone.

5428
02:40:40,990 --> 02:40:41,630
Oh, my God.

5429
02:40:41,670 --> 02:40:43,370
The fact that I can't see anything is crazy, bro.

5430
02:40:43,450 --> 02:40:44,430
I have a technical problem.

5431
02:40:44,430 --> 02:40:44,750
Okay.

5432
02:40:44,750 --> 02:40:45,370
I have two T -shirts, two quads.

5433
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:45,910
Yeah.

5434
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:47,930
He's just going to stand here and he'll let us know.

5435
02:40:48,510 --> 02:40:48,870
Yeah.

5436
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,890
Actually, good comms.

5437
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:50,010
Wait.

5438
02:40:50,910 --> 02:40:51,270
Yeah.

5439
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:53,230
They'll be like, what is this Mirage doing in the open?

5440
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:56,790
This is going to fuck me over so hard if we actually play.

5441
02:40:57,010 --> 02:40:58,330
This will do me so bad.

5442
02:40:58,850 --> 02:41:00,490
I literally can't heal with my gunfight.

5443
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:01,930
It's crazy.

5444
02:41:02,650 --> 02:41:03,370
Bro, they have...

5445
02:41:03,370 --> 02:41:04,750
Why nerf us?

5446
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:06,350
Yeah, why nerf us?

5447
02:41:06,430 --> 02:41:06,530
Yeah.

5448
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:06,630
What is this?

5449
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:06,970
...

5450
02:41:06,970 --> 02:41:10,210
If you rejoin, do you think that would help?

5451
02:41:10,370 --> 02:41:12,450
Bro, if he does that, he's going to fucking...

5452
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:14,410
We have a team fight.

5453
02:41:15,170 --> 02:41:17,670
I think if I leave it doesn't fix anything.

5454
02:41:17,750 --> 02:41:18,850
I think it's just an official bug in my game.

5455
02:41:19,470 --> 02:41:21,930
Also I don't want to risk it because what if it just gets sent on and I'm just gone.

5456
02:41:22,070 --> 02:41:22,810
I'd rather just play with it.

5457
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:25,490
Shoot my clone!

5458
02:41:25,830 --> 02:41:28,370
He's literally having a fun time in the open.

5459
02:41:29,930 --> 02:41:30,510
He's real.

5460
02:41:30,750 --> 02:41:31,230
I swear.

5461
02:41:31,250 --> 02:41:34,130
Imagine that's just you and they're not shooting you because they think it's a clone.

5462
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:34,790
Oh my god!

5463
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:35,950
I should... do you guys want to try that?

5464
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:38,150
Yeah, you should do it right now.

5465
02:41:38,290 --> 02:41:41,110
Okay, okay.

5466
02:41:41,330 --> 02:41:41,650
Never mind.

5467
02:41:42,610 --> 02:41:43,370
Never mind.

5468
02:41:43,490 --> 02:41:44,770
Read through it immediately.

5469
02:41:47,210 --> 02:41:48,130
I'm not going to peek anymore.

5470
02:41:48,290 --> 02:41:48,490
I'm stupid.

5471
02:41:49,390 --> 02:41:50,730
Bro, how do you know which one is a clone?

5472
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:52,590
I'm seeing a bright yellow thing in my face.

5473
02:41:52,690 --> 02:41:53,190
This is fire.

5474
02:41:54,670 --> 02:41:55,350
Where am I?

5475
02:41:55,530 --> 02:41:56,230
I can't see.

5476
02:41:59,290 --> 02:42:00,590
The syringe is half!

5477
02:42:00,910 --> 02:42:04,330
My screen is covered in half with the syringe.

5478
02:42:04,450 --> 02:42:05,530
It's ridiculous, bro.

5479
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:07,810
Why does no one want to shoot me?

5480
02:42:09,710 --> 02:42:10,970
Please, you're not up there.

5481
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:11,610
Don't shoot her.

5482
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:20,490
I don't know if that guy is actually trying to shoot my clone or not.

5483
02:42:20,730 --> 02:42:22,230
I saw straight bullets.

5484
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:24,010
How is my clone traveling so far?

5485
02:42:24,370 --> 02:42:25,450
He shot him!

5486
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:28,370
He got bamboozled 50 meters away.

5487
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:30,150
Get on, nerd.

5488
02:42:31,130 --> 02:42:35,130
Okay, do you think this is a Mirage clone?

5489
02:42:35,270 --> 02:42:36,010
Are they going to shoot me?

5490
02:42:37,130 --> 02:42:38,290
Shoot her for the scan, please.

5491
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:44,960
If I die, I blame Wig because I'm doing something dumb.

5492
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:45,300
I'm down for that.

5493
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:48,440
I'm not getting shot at.

5494
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:55,320
It works!

5495
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:58,480
That is fucking crazy, bro.

5496
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:02,360
They actually let me just run around.

5497
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:04,440
No way.

5498
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:06,940
I peeped my head through a second and got lit the fuck up.

5499
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:12,780
Alright, hopefully, guys, a minute left.

5500
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:14,480
We'll see the damage you're on, Zell.

5501
02:43:14,480 --> 02:43:15,840
I think it's going right towards us.

5502
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:21,580
I don't know if they're shooting me or what.

5503
02:43:21,960 --> 02:43:22,520
They are?

5504
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,520
Wait, they are!

5505
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:24,940
No!

5506
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:28,040
Okay, now I'm not doing that again.

5507
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:28,820
We're good.

5508
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:33,300
I have one shield cell left because I fucked around.

5509
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:35,960
Don't hit me.

5510
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:38,900
Okay.

5511
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:42,020
I fucked around a little, so now I have one shield cell left.

5512
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:43,060
Nice.

5513
02:43:43,100 --> 02:43:43,780
How many of you have Zembo?

5514
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:45,260
I have one.

5515
02:43:45,260 --> 02:43:45,640
Here's a pet.

5516
02:43:46,060 --> 02:43:47,180
I have one five now.

5517
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,160
I am two five.

5518
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:49,720
I'm one two five.

5519
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:52,800
Alrighty, alrighty, alrighty, alrighty.

5520
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,360
Let's see, let's see.

5521
02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:53,860
Come on, baby.

5522
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,100
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

5523
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:00,270
I'm real.

5524
02:44:02,290 --> 02:44:03,750
Chat, we think if the zone comes here or what?

5525
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:04,790
I don't think so.

5526
02:44:05,750 --> 02:44:07,030
Okay, guys, come on.

5527
02:44:08,870 --> 02:44:09,490
Yeah, I see you.

5528
02:44:11,430 --> 02:44:13,510
Let's see it pull to the other side!

5529
02:44:14,670 --> 02:44:15,310
Oh, Victoria!

5530
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:16,550
Let's see it pull!

5531
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:16,970
Oh!

5532
02:44:17,390 --> 02:44:18,350
It's not bad, it's not bad for us.

5533
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:20,110
Wait, we're so good, we're so good, we're so good!

5534
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:20,630
Wait.

5535
02:44:22,690 --> 02:44:23,530
Is anyone in armory?

5536
02:44:24,170 --> 02:44:24,990
Wait, we're so good.

5537
02:44:24,990 --> 02:44:25,850
We're gonna get sent on though.

5538
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:26,830
We're so good.

5539
02:44:28,190 --> 02:44:29,830
Did we just play backside rock over here now?

5540
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:31,830
Isn't there people there?

5541
02:44:32,450 --> 02:44:33,070
I don't think so.

5542
02:44:35,030 --> 02:44:35,610
I mean, we could.

5543
02:44:36,090 --> 02:44:37,170
It's all good for now, it's all good for now.

5544
02:44:37,250 --> 02:44:37,370
Okay.

5545
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:38,670
We're gonna hold out southwest.

5546
02:44:38,930 --> 02:44:39,790
We're gonna literally hold out southwest.

5547
02:44:39,870 --> 02:44:40,170
That's the goal.

5548
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:40,890
Oh.

5549
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:44,110
These guys need to die on the rotation end.

5550
02:44:44,370 --> 02:44:44,850
Let's do it.

5551
02:44:44,930 --> 02:44:46,270
Oh, I stuck my decoy in there.

5552
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:48,930
I thought that was you.

5553
02:44:50,390 --> 02:44:52,930
Okay, so southwest is gonna be our number one enemy here, guys.

5554
02:44:53,170 --> 02:44:53,490
Okay.

5555
02:44:53,550 --> 02:44:54,590
And they're gonna start picking us soon too.

5556
02:44:54,750 --> 02:44:57,650
Okay, I don't know if I wanna waste some meds though.

5557
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:04,990
I'm not sure if I wanna waste these meds.

5558
02:45:09,860 --> 02:45:10,660
Yeah, you bad.

5559
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:12,220
Yeah, Tempo, stop peeking, I think.

5560
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:15,060
Yeah, definitely stop peeking, Tempo, for sure.

5561
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:18,400
Don't worry, I'm gonna see if I can grab intel.

5562
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:21,500
I'm just peeking so I can make sure these guys know that we're looking at them.

5563
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:23,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too.

5564
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:26,260
Wait, are they actually sniping my decoy and missing?

5565
02:45:26,460 --> 02:45:27,000
I think they are.

5566
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:27,960
They did.

5567
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:29,800
I just watched it happen.

5568
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:35,420
Don't come this way, we're watching you.

5569
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:37,360
They know we have to go this way, that's why.

5570
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:38,400
They can go the other way.

5571
02:45:38,540 --> 02:45:39,620
Should we not go to the rock now, or wait?

5572
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:40,160
They're triangle thinking.

5573
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:42,200
Nah, they're gonna stay here for now.

5574
02:45:42,960 --> 02:45:45,300
I don't really wanna jump too early and then we just get fucking shit on.

5575
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:46,140
And we stop Valko.

5576
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:47,640
Yeah, we do, yeah.

5577
02:45:48,220 --> 02:45:50,340
I just don't know if anyone's back there and we Valko'd and then they take our spot.

5578
02:45:51,320 --> 02:45:52,040
Forwarding to the next ring.

5579
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:52,760
That's the only problem.

5580
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:53,860
Yeah, that's true.

5581
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:55,060
It smells kinda like...

5582
02:45:56,540 --> 02:45:57,280
Alright, let's see where they go.

5583
02:45:57,440 --> 02:45:57,640
Whatever.

5584
02:45:58,340 --> 02:45:59,200
Let's keep looking over here.

5585
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:00,560
Just don't take too much damage.

5586
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:01,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5587
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:02,060
Someone dropped down here.

5588
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:03,400
I don't know if it was that team.

5589
02:46:03,400 --> 02:46:03,660
They're going left.

5590
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:04,180
I think they're leaving us.

5591
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:04,700
They're leaving us.

5592
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:05,060
Yeah, they did.

5593
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:05,960
They went up the tunnel.

5594
02:46:05,960 --> 02:46:06,440
They went up the tunnel.

5595
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:06,800
It's fine.

5596
02:46:07,380 --> 02:46:08,980
That's only two that left that I saw.

5597
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:10,540
All three, all three, all three there.

5598
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:10,960
All three?

5599
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:11,900
Yeah, yeah, I just saw.

5600
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:13,220
We're doing it.

5601
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:14,740
Look at this decoy.

5602
02:46:14,820 --> 02:46:15,480
I just got bamboozled.

5603
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:16,260
I just got bamboozled.

5604
02:46:16,260 --> 02:46:18,080
Oh my god, you got bamboozled too?

5605
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:19,540
Where's the care pack at?

5606
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:19,980
I need to scan.

5607
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:20,820
I hear a pack.

5608
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:23,160
To our right.

5609
02:46:24,340 --> 02:46:26,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5610
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:27,080
It's fine.

5611
02:46:27,140 --> 02:46:27,360
We're good.

5612
02:46:29,780 --> 02:46:30,680
Yeah, you wanna do it?

5613
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:31,520
I'll do it back, bitch.

5614
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:33,540
I don't care.

5615
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,040
That clone didn't really go anywhere.

5616
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:35,480
Yeah.

5617
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:37,720
There's a right team back rock.

5618
02:46:38,140 --> 02:46:38,740
Knock that guy.

5619
02:46:38,840 --> 02:46:39,840
Holy shit, get shit on.

5620
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:40,420
Okay.

5621
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:41,920
I got shot from behind.

5622
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:42,980
There's someone behind that rock.

5623
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:43,740
They're behind the rock now.

5624
02:46:43,900 --> 02:46:44,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5625
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:45,040
We're good, we're good, we're good.

5626
02:46:45,100 --> 02:46:45,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5627
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:46,240
We're good.

5628
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:49,100
I'm gonna kill this guy.

5629
02:46:49,220 --> 02:46:49,940
Wait, he's sliding down here.

5630
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:50,560
Oh, no.

5631
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:51,700
He went into that tunnel.

5632
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:52,660
Let's see where Zundas goes.

5633
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:55,060
Zundas, pull back rock.

5634
02:46:55,720 --> 02:46:56,560
Where can we go here?

5635
02:46:56,660 --> 02:46:57,620
This is so bad for us actually.

5636
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:58,060
Holy fuck.

5637
02:46:58,820 --> 02:47:01,480
Well, we can't go behind this because there's a team there now.

5638
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:03,520
We can't play silo.

5639
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:03,980
I don't think either.

5640
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:05,160
Silo will just get shot at.

5641
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:11,300
Yeah, they're all the way behind.

5642
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:12,920
I mean, we have Velko.

5643
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:14,640
We can Velko here.

5644
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:15,000
Where the fuck did he go?

5645
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:16,240
I don't know.

5646
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:17,680
We have to help Mary somewhere.

5647
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:20,320
I think we just walk in slow and just go to silo here.

5648
02:47:20,380 --> 02:47:20,920
We just walk in slow.

5649
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,100
I'm trying to kill everyone that's inside.

5650
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:23,040
That's all we can do.

5651
02:47:23,400 --> 02:47:24,000
Just play slow.

5652
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:25,020
Don't take any damage.

5653
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:26,240
Let these teams fight inside.

5654
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:27,300
We just third party and walk up.

5655
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:27,720
Stay slow.

5656
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:28,040
All right.

5657
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:29,760
We're gonna play for the height.

5658
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:31,120
We'll see if they fight inside.

5659
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:31,780
They should.

5660
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:36,290
Team flying in.

5661
02:47:36,370 --> 02:47:36,590
We're good.

5662
02:47:39,890 --> 02:47:40,930
Yep, just get some shots down.

5663
02:47:40,970 --> 02:47:41,270
We're all good.

5664
02:47:41,410 --> 02:47:41,990
Oh, they made a walk?

5665
02:47:42,230 --> 02:47:43,370
Oh, they catwalked.

5666
02:47:43,470 --> 02:47:44,690
Yeah, they catwalked.

5667
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:45,250
That's fine.

5668
02:47:45,270 --> 02:47:45,670
Yeah, we're good.

5669
02:47:47,070 --> 02:47:47,590
They're doing quick.

5670
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:48,490
We're fighting whoever's there.

5671
02:47:49,030 --> 02:47:49,890
Yeah, just keep playing here.

5672
02:47:49,930 --> 02:47:50,370
Just keep playing there.

5673
02:47:50,470 --> 02:47:51,130
You guys be playing there.

5674
02:47:51,190 --> 02:47:51,710
I'm gonna move up a little bit.

5675
02:47:51,750 --> 02:47:52,030
Just hold space.

5676
02:47:52,270 --> 02:47:52,410
All right.

5677
02:47:52,410 --> 02:47:52,510
All right.

5678
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:54,090
We're looking.

5679
02:47:56,470 --> 02:47:57,650
One drop down right here.

5680
02:47:58,030 --> 02:47:58,370
I'm looking.

5681
02:47:59,090 --> 02:47:59,790
Two drop down.

5682
02:47:59,990 --> 02:48:00,290
Two, yeah.

5683
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:02,170
No armor 23.

5684
02:48:03,010 --> 02:48:03,890
Yeah, just keep looking there, guys.

5685
02:48:03,990 --> 02:48:04,830
I'm looking at somebody else right now.

5686
02:48:05,650 --> 02:48:06,310
You guys keep looking there.

5687
02:48:06,330 --> 02:48:07,290
They're not peeking us right now.

5688
02:48:07,450 --> 02:48:07,990
I'm looking at you guys.

5689
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:08,310
You guys are good.

5690
02:48:08,410 --> 02:48:08,810
They went up.

5691
02:48:09,630 --> 02:48:10,130
They're going up.

5692
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:10,550
They're going up.

5693
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:11,510
Yeah, we're good.

5694
02:48:13,210 --> 02:48:13,750
They're on the ramp.

5695
02:48:14,750 --> 02:48:15,670
I think I'm gonna get rest of them.

5696
02:48:15,750 --> 02:48:16,330
We need to focus these guys.

5697
02:48:16,430 --> 02:48:16,970
Hardcore left side.

5698
02:48:17,630 --> 02:48:18,050
I'm looking.

5699
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:18,350
I'm looking.

5700
02:48:19,070 --> 02:48:19,570
I'm gonna kill.

5701
02:48:19,590 --> 02:48:19,870
I'm gonna kill.

5702
02:48:20,670 --> 02:48:22,070
I got Mirage bamboozled.

5703
02:48:22,210 --> 02:48:22,470
Oh my god.

5704
02:48:22,470 --> 02:48:23,230
Does anyone have light ammo?

5705
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:24,290
No, I don't.

5706
02:48:24,310 --> 02:48:24,990
I can't spare any.

5707
02:48:24,990 --> 02:48:25,730
I knew I do it here.

5708
02:48:25,810 --> 02:48:26,270
I'm gonna use it.

5709
02:48:26,270 --> 02:48:26,790
I'm gonna use it right now.

5710
02:48:26,810 --> 02:48:27,090
Here.

5711
02:48:27,710 --> 02:48:28,410
Ramp, ramp, ramp, ramp.

5712
02:48:28,470 --> 02:48:29,030
They're shooting ramp.

5713
02:48:29,290 --> 02:48:29,570
Good point.

5714
02:48:29,650 --> 02:48:29,930
Yeah.

5715
02:48:30,690 --> 02:48:31,490
Keep walking up slow.

5716
02:48:31,570 --> 02:48:31,790
We're good.

5717
02:48:32,090 --> 02:48:32,670
Keep shooting ramp.

5718
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:33,330
Just keep shooting ramp again.

5719
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:34,810
Shooting ramp.

5720
02:48:35,470 --> 02:48:36,470
Yeah, just keep looking left side.

5721
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:36,770
We're good.

5722
02:48:36,850 --> 02:48:37,350
Just keep looking.

5723
02:48:39,990 --> 02:48:40,630
Nice job, Ducky.

5724
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,990
You're doing great.

5725
02:48:41,250 --> 02:48:42,030
We're gonna move in slowly.

5726
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:42,410
All right.

5727
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:47,230
Wait, wait, wait.

5728
02:48:47,330 --> 02:48:48,550
There's a team right below.

5729
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:49,290
There's a team right below us.

5730
02:48:49,390 --> 02:48:50,950
Come to me.

5731
02:48:51,010 --> 02:48:51,230
Come to me.

5732
02:48:51,330 --> 02:48:51,570
I'm here.

5733
02:48:51,610 --> 02:48:52,130
Wait, wait, wait.

5734
02:48:53,070 --> 02:48:54,370
Temba, put Q's over here, on the wall.

5735
02:48:58,230 --> 02:48:58,690
Below me.

5736
02:48:58,750 --> 02:48:59,090
Below me.

5737
02:48:59,090 --> 02:48:59,450
Below me.

5738
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:00,190
Yeah, shoot left.

5739
02:49:00,210 --> 02:49:00,570
Shoot left.

5740
02:49:00,570 --> 02:49:00,670
Shoot left.

5741
02:49:00,670 --> 02:49:00,770
Yeah.

5742
02:49:01,510 --> 02:49:01,950
Oh, right.

5743
02:49:02,070 --> 02:49:02,370
Left side.

5744
02:49:02,410 --> 02:49:02,570
Left side.

5745
02:49:02,590 --> 02:49:02,930
Left side.

5746
02:49:02,930 --> 02:49:03,250
Left side.

5747
02:49:04,670 --> 02:49:05,570
Right behind us.

5748
02:49:05,570 --> 02:49:06,450
There's a Mirage, there's a Mirage.

5749
02:49:06,550 --> 02:49:07,010
Two, two, two, two.

5750
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:09,070
Crouch, crouch, crouch.

5751
02:49:10,370 --> 02:49:10,810
Dippo, no.

5752
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:12,850
We got this, buddy.

5753
02:49:12,910 --> 02:49:13,430
Jump down if you need.

5754
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:14,030
Play left.

5755
02:49:14,090 --> 02:49:14,350
Play left.

5756
02:49:15,010 --> 02:49:15,970
I have a tree.

5757
02:49:16,710 --> 02:49:17,390
You're a tree.

5758
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:19,610
I don't move.

5759
02:49:19,790 --> 02:49:21,330
It's just a duo behind us, man.

5760
02:49:22,870 --> 02:49:24,170
They came out of nowhere.

5761
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:25,710
The Valk is right in front of me.

5762
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:28,350
Pretend you don't exist.

5763
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:29,850
It's okay.

5764
02:49:30,090 --> 02:49:30,330
You're doing great.

5765
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:33,250
Don't do anything.

5766
02:49:33,710 --> 02:49:34,930
Do not do anything.

5767
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:38,470
They're tunnel visioning right now.

5768
02:49:38,670 --> 02:49:38,810
Top 10!

5769
02:49:39,470 --> 02:49:40,590
Top 10!

5770
02:49:41,150 --> 02:49:41,370
Good job!

5771
02:49:41,370 --> 02:49:41,370
Nice!

5772
02:49:41,410 --> 02:49:42,290
We got top 10!

5773
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:45,050
Let's try.

5774
02:49:45,110 --> 02:49:45,870
Damn it.

5775
02:49:47,550 --> 02:49:49,370
They actually look...

5776
02:49:49,370 --> 02:49:50,150
We got top 10!

5777
02:49:51,290 --> 02:49:52,150
We'll take it.

5778
02:49:52,270 --> 02:49:53,870
We got top 10 and a kill.

5779
02:49:53,990 --> 02:49:54,650
That's fine.

5780
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:57,110
I'm gonna pee again.

5781
02:49:57,850 --> 02:49:58,370
What?

5782
02:49:59,050 --> 02:49:59,830
You got what?

5783
02:50:00,110 --> 02:50:01,350
He has to urinate again.

5784
02:50:03,070 --> 02:50:03,590
What?

5785
02:50:03,970 --> 02:50:04,950
He has to pee again.

5786
02:50:05,830 --> 02:50:07,790
What the fuck is wrong with you?

5787
02:50:07,810 --> 02:50:09,350
I have no idea.

5788
02:50:11,370 --> 02:50:11,590
That's not healthy.

5789
02:50:12,990 --> 02:50:14,750
That is 100% not healthy.

5790
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:17,370
You're peeing every 15 minutes.

5791
02:50:18,470 --> 02:50:19,090
I agree.

5792
02:50:19,650 --> 02:50:20,610
Nice job, though.

5793
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:21,150
We did a good job.

5794
02:50:22,430 --> 02:50:23,730
We just killed that duo.

5795
02:50:23,830 --> 02:50:24,670
We could actually be alive right now.

5796
02:50:25,630 --> 02:50:27,050
They just came out of nowhere.

5797
02:50:27,330 --> 02:50:28,750
I thought they were not rotating to us.

5798
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:30,130
I don't know why they did that.

5799
02:50:30,490 --> 02:50:31,630
I thought they were going inside.

5800
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:34,850
It worked out, but it is what it is.

5801
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:39,330
Temple definitely has a bladder problem right now.

5802
02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:40,450
For sure.

5803
02:50:41,370 --> 02:50:41,670
I'm nervous.

5804
02:50:41,890 --> 02:50:43,550
How is he nervous?

5805
02:50:43,830 --> 02:50:45,010
How is he nervous?

5806
02:50:48,130 --> 02:50:49,930
Why the fuck is he nervous?

5807
02:50:51,450 --> 02:50:53,130
How the fuck is he nervous?

5808
02:50:53,310 --> 02:50:55,690
He's the diamond three in the game.

5809
02:50:56,170 --> 02:50:57,050
That's what I'm saying.

5810
02:50:58,770 --> 02:50:59,470
It's okay.

5811
02:51:00,150 --> 02:51:01,470
As long as...

5812
02:51:02,130 --> 02:51:02,790
It's okay.

5813
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:04,990
We got top 10 plus one point.

5814
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:08,190
As long as Greek got not top 10 plus one, I'm so happy.

5815
02:51:08,270 --> 02:51:08,730
Yeah, yeah.

5816
02:51:08,730 --> 02:51:10,190
That's all we have to worry about.

5817
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:11,790
That's all we need.

5818
02:51:12,910 --> 02:51:13,890
That's all I care about.

5819
02:51:14,110 --> 02:51:15,450
We got the vibes.

5820
02:51:15,970 --> 02:51:17,270
That's all we need.

5821
02:51:17,390 --> 02:51:17,930
The vibes.

5822
02:51:19,370 --> 02:51:19,770
Wow.

5823
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:21,130
I see the spy for the wraith.

5824
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:22,930
I'm checking the wraith play right now.

5825
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:23,730
Wait, did he get that?

5826
02:51:24,090 --> 02:51:24,770
He tried.

5827
02:51:26,130 --> 02:51:27,050
No, he did.

5828
02:51:27,330 --> 02:51:31,530
That would have been so fucking funny.

5829
02:51:31,730 --> 02:51:32,990
That would have been so nice if he did that.

5830
02:51:32,990 --> 02:51:34,070
Look at all the rats out here, man.

5831
02:51:34,070 --> 02:51:35,370
There's so many rats.

5832
02:51:35,550 --> 02:51:36,890
Oh my god, look at all these rats.

5833
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:38,210
That could have been tempo.

5834
02:51:38,690 --> 02:51:40,550
That could have been tempo.

5835
02:51:41,490 --> 02:51:41,850
What?

5836
02:51:42,370 --> 02:51:42,950
I know.

5837
02:51:45,290 --> 02:51:46,410
I can't believe they saw you.

5838
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:47,990
You could have been free.

5839
02:51:48,670 --> 02:51:49,530
Yeah, I'm lucky and surprised.

5840
02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:50,990
Me too.

5841
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:53,430
They should have been so distracted with the people above me.

5842
02:51:53,910 --> 02:51:55,350
Honestly, Dembo, did you have cat wall there?

5843
02:51:56,130 --> 02:51:56,490
Yes.

5844
02:51:57,150 --> 02:51:58,810
We should have cat walled ourselves, to be honest.

5845
02:52:00,350 --> 02:52:03,530
We go to that pillar and we just cat wall off the other side.

5846
02:52:04,630 --> 02:52:05,210
That's my bad.

5847
02:52:05,330 --> 02:52:05,830
I should have told you that.

5848
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:06,670
I forgot we were playing cat.

5849
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:09,450
We didn't use any of our ults, except for that one bell.

5850
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:13,470
I got shot so fast, I couldn't even ult.

5851
02:52:13,710 --> 02:52:14,930
No, that's not your fault.

5852
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:15,890
That's my bad.

5853
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:19,610
I should have told 100% tempo to cat wall us off, so teams can't push us.

5854
02:52:19,770 --> 02:52:21,510
Yeah, cat wall behind us.

5855
02:52:22,330 --> 02:52:22,690
Exactly.

5856
02:52:24,550 --> 02:52:25,050
It's okay.

5857
02:52:25,650 --> 02:52:26,470
The next game.

5858
02:52:26,590 --> 02:52:27,110
Now we know.

5859
02:52:27,330 --> 02:52:29,090
Did we get a kill?

5860
02:52:29,450 --> 02:52:30,250
Yeah, we got one kill.

5861
02:52:30,970 --> 02:52:32,210
I got to kill the Lombo.

5862
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:33,210
Nice.

5863
02:52:34,430 --> 02:52:39,630
I like after that first game, Temple hasn't got a kill for more subs.

5864
02:52:40,330 --> 02:52:41,690
That poor Valk.

5865
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:42,430
What the fuck?

5866
02:52:42,510 --> 02:52:42,530
Wait, wait.

5867
02:52:42,650 --> 02:52:43,450
That means we're at 11?

5868
02:52:46,010 --> 02:52:46,970
There's no way.

5869
02:52:48,010 --> 02:52:48,870
He tried.

5870
02:52:49,370 --> 02:52:50,990
That Valk definitely tried.

5871
02:52:51,330 --> 02:52:52,230
They did their best.

5872
02:52:53,470 --> 02:52:54,210
Hey, listen.

5873
02:52:54,410 --> 02:52:55,710
10th place, one kill.

5874
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:56,190
Not awful.

5875
02:52:56,450 --> 02:52:57,210
Yeah, yeah.

5876
02:52:57,950 --> 02:52:59,130
It's pretty decent.

5877
02:52:59,670 --> 02:53:01,010
Pretty fucking decent, guys.

5878
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:03,790
You know, it means we're better than Greek.

5879
02:53:03,930 --> 02:53:04,910
Okay, let's check Greek score.

5880
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:05,670
Oh no.

5881
02:53:05,730 --> 02:53:06,550
I think you just won.

5882
02:53:06,630 --> 02:53:06,890
Imagine.

5883
02:53:07,530 --> 02:53:07,930
No.

5884
02:53:09,250 --> 02:53:09,930
Don't say that.

5885
02:53:10,010 --> 02:53:10,390
Don't say that.

5886
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:11,630
Don't.

5887
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:11,830
No.

5888
02:53:12,010 --> 02:53:12,350
No.

5889
02:53:12,810 --> 02:53:15,670
No, we needed him to not win a game.

5890
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:17,030
Please no.

5891
02:53:17,070 --> 02:53:17,470
Please no.

5892
02:53:17,490 --> 02:53:17,910
Please no.

5893
02:53:17,930 --> 02:53:18,290
Please no.

5894
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:18,430
Please no.

5895
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:21,470
Oh no.

5896
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:23,010
Okay, it's not Greek.

5897
02:53:23,150 --> 02:53:23,710
Okay, nice.

5898
02:53:23,870 --> 02:53:24,110
Okay.

5899
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:25,430
Wait, peeps was below us too.

5900
02:53:25,430 --> 02:53:26,570
Oh no.

5901
02:53:26,910 --> 02:53:27,490
Damn it.

5902
02:53:27,630 --> 02:53:28,370
Oh no.

5903
02:53:29,450 --> 02:53:30,030
Oh no.

5904
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:31,730
Wait, wait.

5905
02:53:31,810 --> 02:53:32,290
Where's Greek?

5906
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:33,270
Greek's 14.

5907
02:53:33,630 --> 02:53:34,270
Where's 14?

5908
02:53:34,470 --> 02:53:34,930
Where is 14?

5909
02:53:35,090 --> 02:53:35,390
14.

5910
02:53:35,470 --> 02:53:36,410
He got zero kills.

5911
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,650
14th place.

5912
02:53:38,610 --> 02:53:39,410
Zero points.

5913
02:53:39,570 --> 02:53:39,930
Zero points.

5914
02:53:40,050 --> 02:53:40,450
We're at 6.

5915
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:41,370
We're at 11.

5916
02:53:41,810 --> 02:53:42,210
Nice.

5917
02:53:42,210 --> 02:53:42,410
Okay.

5918
02:53:42,750 --> 02:53:43,550
Where's Jent?

5919
02:53:43,990 --> 02:53:45,130
Greek's team had zero points.

5920
02:53:45,210 --> 02:53:45,810
We're still fine.

5921
02:53:46,310 --> 02:53:47,590
Yeah, Jent's team's 6.

5922
02:53:47,710 --> 02:53:48,990
He got 9th with 2.

5923
02:53:49,290 --> 02:53:50,330
A little bit of a lost.

5924
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:51,530
Is he gonna pass us?

5925
02:53:52,070 --> 02:53:52,570
No, no.

5926
02:53:52,610 --> 02:53:53,490
He was already past us.

5927
02:53:53,590 --> 02:53:54,450
But we were gonna...

5928
02:53:55,870 --> 02:53:58,090
Okay, so we're only 3 points away from Jent.

5929
02:53:58,170 --> 02:53:58,890
We're at 19.

5930
02:53:59,550 --> 02:54:00,150
It's okay.

5931
02:54:00,470 --> 02:54:01,310
We're not...

5932
02:54:01,310 --> 02:54:07,010
Greek just needs a really, really good game to... Reptarium Greek?

5933
02:54:07,230 --> 02:54:08,750
Okay, we just need to beat your roommate.

5934
02:54:09,190 --> 02:54:10,130
That's all I want, bro.

5935
02:54:10,230 --> 02:54:10,790
That's all I want.

5936
02:54:10,930 --> 02:54:12,130
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

5937
02:54:12,250 --> 02:54:12,790
I'll be right back.

5938
02:54:13,090 --> 02:54:14,450
That's all I want, bro.

5939
02:54:14,990 --> 02:54:15,730
That's all I need.

5940
02:54:15,830 --> 02:54:17,250
Okay, hopefully these next lessons are good for us.

5941
02:54:18,270 --> 02:54:20,270
We definitely don't need support, to be honest.

5942
02:54:20,310 --> 02:54:20,950
We haven't used it once.

5943
02:54:21,450 --> 02:54:22,110
To be fair.

5944
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:22,250
Yeah.

5945
02:54:22,370 --> 02:54:24,770
I'm gonna go Fuse if she wants to.

5946
02:54:25,430 --> 02:54:26,610
I'm gonna go with the controller.

5947
02:54:27,070 --> 02:54:27,670
Yeah, we'll see.

5948
02:54:27,750 --> 02:54:28,690
We'll see what... If we... yeah.

5949
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:31,730
I think the next one's like pretty weird.

5950
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:32,990
I think it's... let me see.

5951
02:54:33,050 --> 02:54:33,870
I think... I know they put it there.

5952
02:54:34,150 --> 02:54:35,150
I think it's...

5953
02:54:36,330 --> 02:54:36,610
Uh...

5954
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:38,190
Oh, they're typing it right now.

5955
02:54:38,210 --> 02:54:38,430
Let's wait.

5956
02:54:39,350 --> 02:54:41,050
It's like 6 Skirmisher or some shit like that.

5957
02:54:41,110 --> 02:54:42,070
It's like majority of Skirmish.

5958
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:42,970
I think it was.

5959
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:44,130
Wait, which one's Skirmisher?

5960
02:54:47,530 --> 02:54:48,090
6 Assault.

5961
02:54:49,830 --> 02:54:50,910
It's 6 Assault this time around?

5962
02:54:51,550 --> 02:54:52,230
I have no idea.

5963
02:54:52,310 --> 02:54:52,990
I was making it up.

5964
02:54:53,270 --> 02:54:53,550
Oh.

5965
02:54:53,970 --> 02:54:54,730
What did Clara say?

5966
02:54:59,110 --> 02:54:59,970
Can y'all...

5967
02:54:59,970 --> 02:55:00,510
Okay, yes.

5968
02:55:01,610 --> 02:55:02,110
Who is it?

5969
02:55:02,250 --> 02:55:02,450
Who is it?

5970
02:55:04,170 --> 02:55:05,250
Assault, controller, support.

5971
02:55:06,030 --> 02:55:10,510
Okay, so we have Ash, MadMaggie, Ballistic, Watson, Rampart, Loba, Mirage, Conduit.

5972
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:11,550
Holy fuck.

5973
02:55:12,710 --> 02:55:13,670
Um... My god.

5974
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:15,030
They really saved the worst for last.

5975
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:15,510
I like that.

5976
02:55:16,450 --> 02:55:17,610
Uh... Alright, so who are you gonna play?

5977
02:55:17,910 --> 02:55:18,510
I'm Fused.

5978
02:55:19,730 --> 02:55:20,690
There's no... Oh, there's Fused.

5979
02:55:20,730 --> 02:55:20,850
Okay.

5980
02:55:20,950 --> 02:55:23,550
Who is she gonna play?

5981
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:24,030
I'm back.

5982
02:55:24,410 --> 02:55:24,730
Wait.

5983
02:55:24,730 --> 02:55:25,750
Watson or Rampart?

5984
02:55:26,050 --> 02:55:27,970
Wait, what's the... What's the thing?

5985
02:55:28,650 --> 02:55:29,830
It's Ash and Maggie.

5986
02:55:30,170 --> 02:55:32,410
Oh, I can do Conduit.

5987
02:55:33,150 --> 02:55:33,790
Alright, I'm down.

5988
02:55:33,930 --> 02:55:34,490
Oh, that sounds great.

5989
02:55:34,530 --> 02:55:35,290
Yeah, I can do Conduit.

5990
02:55:35,890 --> 02:55:37,550
And maybe I'll just do Ash for the TP.

5991
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:39,530
Alright, cool.

5992
02:55:39,670 --> 02:55:40,150
Down, down, down, down.

5993
02:55:40,310 --> 02:55:41,430
Yeah, so we got Ash.

5994
02:55:41,790 --> 02:55:45,990
Wait, is Temple gonna play Watson or Rampart?

5995
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:47,230
Oh, actually, yeah.

5996
02:55:47,310 --> 02:55:47,830
I can play Watson.

5997
02:55:47,990 --> 02:55:48,790
Yeah, play Watson.

5998
02:55:48,790 --> 02:55:50,770
This is the last game.

5999
02:55:50,890 --> 02:55:57,270
As long as Grief dies before us, then we've, like, established that we're better than Grief's team.

6000
02:55:57,890 --> 02:56:00,310
Grief, you gotta go out last, man.

6001
02:56:00,530 --> 02:56:02,370
No, do you know what's even... I can't go out last.

6002
02:56:02,430 --> 02:56:07,250
We have no pro player on our team, but we're still above a pro player team.

6003
02:56:08,390 --> 02:56:09,070
Yeah, true.

6004
02:56:09,330 --> 02:56:10,390
If you think about it that way.

6005
02:56:10,810 --> 02:56:11,630
Like you're spinning.

6006
02:56:11,950 --> 02:56:12,370
Yeah.

6007
02:56:13,750 --> 02:56:15,390
We literally have...

6008
02:56:16,530 --> 02:56:17,670
Why are you a genius?

6009
02:56:17,930 --> 02:56:18,270
.

6010
02:56:21,310 --> 02:56:22,730
We basically won.

6011
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:26,530
Any team that's below us is embarrassing.

6012
02:56:27,590 --> 02:56:29,490
Alright, let's pass a few more then.

6013
02:56:31,770 --> 02:56:32,690
That is fucking for sure.

6014
02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:33,170
That is fucking for sure.

6015
02:56:34,110 --> 02:56:36,090
And that's gonna be one team, which is Grief's.

6016
02:56:36,230 --> 02:56:37,810
Yeah, it's gonna be one team.

6017
02:56:38,070 --> 02:56:40,270
Is it funnier if it's just one team?

6018
02:56:40,590 --> 02:56:42,870
And, by the way, in Reptar had first pick.

6019
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:44,750
In Reptar had first pick.

6020
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:45,510
True.

6021
02:56:47,210 --> 02:56:48,250
I'm gonna be regretting that game.

6022
02:56:48,270 --> 02:56:49,390
I'm gonna be regretting that game.

6023
02:56:50,350 --> 02:56:51,190
I'm gonna be regretting that game.

6024
02:56:52,090 --> 02:56:53,990
Alright, we'll see what happens, dude.

6025
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:57,730
Alright, so I'm gonna go Ashe, then you go Watson, then you go Conduit?

6026
02:56:57,870 --> 02:56:58,870
Yeah, I go Conduit.

6027
02:56:59,370 --> 02:57:01,730
This is our sweatiest comp so far.

6028
02:57:01,930 --> 02:57:04,070
This is our actual real comp so far.

6029
02:57:04,710 --> 02:57:05,470
This is our actual real comp so far.

6030
02:57:05,470 --> 02:57:06,970
It's like the only real one that makes sense.

6031
02:57:07,270 --> 02:57:07,690
It's like the only real one that makes sense.

6032
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:11,790
Alright, I swapped.

6033
02:57:13,770 --> 02:57:14,690
I'm back in.

6034
02:57:16,350 --> 02:57:17,190
I'm back in.

6035
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:17,710
This is it.

6036
02:57:21,350 --> 02:57:22,230
We're gonna...

6037
02:57:24,530 --> 02:57:28,530
My goal is, as long as we're above Grief's team, that's all I want.

6038
02:57:29,670 --> 02:57:30,990
That's all I want.

6039
02:57:31,290 --> 02:57:32,110
That's really all we want right now.

6040
02:57:32,130 --> 02:57:32,570
Yeah.

6041
02:57:33,610 --> 02:57:34,910
Yeah, warm up's done, guys.

6042
02:57:34,990 --> 02:57:35,790
Five warm up games.

6043
02:57:35,850 --> 02:57:36,290
That's all we needed.

6044
02:57:36,490 --> 02:57:36,870
Yeah.

6045
02:57:38,410 --> 02:57:39,510
That's all we need.

6046
02:57:39,610 --> 02:57:47,450
If Peep can go from 19th to a win with 8, we should be able to do that.

6047
02:57:47,530 --> 02:57:47,590
We should be able to do that.

6048
02:57:47,590 --> 02:57:48,930
Okay, but the thing is...

6049
02:57:48,930 --> 02:57:59,030
The thing that separates us from Peep is that all three of us are plat rank right now.

6050
02:57:59,990 --> 02:58:00,550
are plat rank right now.

6051
02:58:00,550 --> 02:58:00,890
Wait...

6052
02:58:02,470 --> 02:58:03,030
Plat?

6053
02:58:03,370 --> 02:58:04,970
Rooting for minus downfield.

6054
02:58:04,970 --> 02:58:05,230
Diamond?

6055
02:58:06,050 --> 02:58:06,810
Raise Pred.

6056
02:58:09,690 --> 02:58:11,770
Yeah, so like, I don't know.

6057
02:58:12,010 --> 02:58:12,510
I don't...

6058
02:58:14,170 --> 02:58:15,510
Our team, like, you know...

6059
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:16,930
We got this.

6060
02:58:17,090 --> 02:58:19,050
Our team has to be like...

6061
02:58:19,050 --> 02:58:22,230
We're definitely the team of the people.

6062
02:58:22,850 --> 02:58:24,570
Yeah, we're the people's squad.

6063
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:27,850
The amount of copium we're on right now is unreal.

6064
02:58:28,910 --> 02:58:30,790
We're the vibe team, guys.

6065
02:58:30,830 --> 02:58:32,930
We're the team that everyone likes, dude.

6066
02:58:33,050 --> 02:58:33,610
We are!

6067
02:58:33,870 --> 02:58:35,530
We can be multiple things!

6068
02:58:36,390 --> 02:58:37,370
Just not good?

6069
02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:38,190
Just not good.

6070
02:58:39,970 --> 02:58:41,250
Everything but good?

6071
02:58:42,890 --> 02:58:44,150
Can you really say that?

6072
02:58:44,170 --> 02:58:46,290
Can you say that we're a good team with a straight face?

6073
02:58:46,650 --> 02:58:47,010
Yeah.

6074
02:58:48,070 --> 02:58:49,330
Only you can, Temple!

6075
02:58:49,450 --> 02:58:50,410
You're the only one!

6076
02:58:50,590 --> 02:58:52,530
He's the only one that has like...

6077
02:58:52,530 --> 02:58:54,270
is like, actually delusional.

6078
02:58:54,450 --> 02:58:55,270
He's the only one.

6079
02:58:55,410 --> 02:58:57,010
I like it, though.

6080
02:58:57,630 --> 02:58:58,750
We need that, though.

6081
02:58:58,830 --> 02:59:01,570
We need somebody that's not in reality.

6082
02:59:02,690 --> 02:59:03,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6083
02:59:04,990 --> 02:59:05,710
Okay, well...

6084
02:59:06,390 --> 02:59:06,750
Hmm.

6085
02:59:07,490 --> 02:59:08,950
Alright, this is our sweatiest comp, bro.

6086
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:09,350
We win this one.

6087
02:59:09,470 --> 02:59:09,910
There's no way.

6088
02:59:10,090 --> 02:59:10,270
Yeah.

6089
02:59:11,110 --> 02:59:12,990
We warmed up for like, whatever the game.

6090
02:59:13,290 --> 02:59:13,670
Doesn't matter.

6091
02:59:13,790 --> 02:59:14,190
It was the last one.

6092
02:59:14,270 --> 02:59:14,610
We got this.

6093
02:59:16,690 --> 02:59:18,970
Petition to play another Storm Point over Olympus.

6094
02:59:19,870 --> 02:59:20,310
Petition to play another Storm Point over Olympus.

6095
02:59:20,310 --> 02:59:20,330
Petition to play another Storm Point over Olympus.

6096
02:59:20,330 --> 02:59:22,050
Low key down for that.

6097
02:59:22,450 --> 02:59:23,330
To be honest.

6098
02:59:24,010 --> 02:59:25,690
I'll let the dude do.

6099
02:59:28,650 --> 02:59:29,950
Petition to reset score.

6100
02:59:30,790 --> 02:59:32,570
Oh my god, so real?

6101
02:59:34,230 --> 02:59:35,570
No, we play Olympus?

6102
02:59:36,990 --> 02:59:37,710
Yeah.

6103
02:59:42,020 --> 02:59:43,600
We're definitely a team.

6104
02:59:43,800 --> 02:59:44,440
I know.

6105
02:59:44,580 --> 02:59:45,960
We're a team.

6106
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:47,160
We're...

6107
02:59:48,460 --> 02:59:49,400
We're a team.

6108
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:50,840
We're...

6109
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:53,260
Twitch Rivals and CEO of Twitch.

6110
02:59:58,720 --> 03:00:01,300
All I'm saying is that...

6111
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:07,540
Wig, I don't know why, but when you're headlining a Twitch Rivals, Right.

6112
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:09,560
Really, everything goes against you.

6113
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:12,480
Not everything.

6114
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:13,260
Not yet.

6115
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:15,260
Not every... No, not everything though.

6116
03:00:15,460 --> 03:00:16,100
Not yet.

6117
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:17,400
It's not about winning.

6118
03:00:17,600 --> 03:00:18,040
Okay?

6119
03:00:18,820 --> 03:00:19,800
It's really about...

6120
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:20,120
It's not?

6121
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:26,380
Wait, then why did you argue about me about that before when I said it wasn't about winning?

6122
03:00:28,140 --> 03:00:29,780
I'm trying to be positive now.

6123
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:32,440
I did point my motivations all the way through the floor.

6124
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:33,100
So you know what I mean?

6125
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:33,760
Like now it's about...

6126
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:35,700
So now it's not about winning.

6127
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:36,680
No, no, of course.

6128
03:00:36,740 --> 03:00:37,060
Bias.

6129
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:37,540
You know what I'm saying?

6130
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:38,060
Now it's about...

6131
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:39,900
Now it's not about winning.

6132
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:40,280
Alright.

6133
03:00:41,360 --> 03:00:41,760
Exactly.

6134
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:43,980
Exactly.

6135
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:46,780
Well, we're up good and we haven't started yet.

6136
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:47,400
Of course it's about winning.

6137
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:48,980
But when we start doing bad, then it's all about the friends.

6138
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:50,760
I can't believe our first game was our peak.

6139
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,580
That was actually the game where we had the most kills.

6140
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:54,720
We have 11 points.

6141
03:00:55,660 --> 03:00:56,220
Pretty good.

6142
03:00:56,300 --> 03:00:57,260
Just need 7.

6143
03:00:57,620 --> 03:00:58,300
For what?

6144
03:00:58,500 --> 03:00:59,320
7 for what though?

6145
03:00:59,320 --> 03:01:00,180
That's a lot of points.

6146
03:01:00,380 --> 03:01:01,760
8 points to get out of bottom 5.

6147
03:01:02,160 --> 03:01:05,900
We got 11 points just from 5 games.

6148
03:01:05,900 --> 03:01:06,480
I don't know.

6149
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:08,280
8 points seems like a 5 game scenario.

6150
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:14,680
You know what?

6151
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:15,580
Are we leaving...

6152
03:01:15,580 --> 03:01:17,140
letting Tempo roam free again?

6153
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:19,360
Wait, where are we?

6154
03:01:19,440 --> 03:01:20,160
No, I can't.

6155
03:01:20,220 --> 03:01:22,020
There's no place to roam to.

6156
03:01:22,140 --> 03:01:23,400
We're in Turbine.

6157
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:24,940
Yeah, but like...

6158
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:28,400
If you survive as a solo...

6159
03:01:28,400 --> 03:01:28,600
Oh, wait.

6160
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:30,920
If we're in Turbine, I can land Waterfall.

6161
03:01:31,220 --> 03:01:31,440
Oh, wait.

6162
03:01:31,440 --> 03:01:31,440
If we're in Turbine, I can land Waterfall.

6163
03:01:31,440 --> 03:01:31,460
Yeah.

6164
03:01:32,380 --> 03:01:33,960
Yeah, we should let him roam free.

6165
03:01:35,080 --> 03:01:35,520
Yeah.

6166
03:01:35,520 --> 03:01:35,880
Yeah, we should let him roam free.

6167
03:01:35,900 --> 03:01:36,120
Should we do it?

6168
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:38,320
What?

6169
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:41,480
Let Tempo roam free again for last game.

6170
03:01:41,740 --> 03:01:42,520
I'm so down.

6171
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:45,360
Okay, actually Tempo, don't even come back to us.

6172
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:46,580
What's the...

6173
03:01:46,580 --> 03:01:47,700
What's the...

6174
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:51,220
What's the butthole POI?

6175
03:01:51,360 --> 03:01:52,920
The butthole POI?

6176
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:53,840
The Turbine?

6177
03:01:54,120 --> 03:01:55,340
Oh, oh, oh.

6178
03:01:55,360 --> 03:01:56,380
Oh, fuck.

6179
03:01:56,620 --> 03:01:56,840
Rift?

6180
03:01:57,040 --> 03:01:58,420
The giant...

6181
03:01:59,820 --> 03:02:00,380
What?

6182
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:04,280
Bro, Tempo, you organized the rifts.

6183
03:02:04,300 --> 03:02:04,380
Oh, Cammon.

6184
03:02:04,380 --> 03:02:04,520
Cammon.

6185
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:05,020
Cammon.

6186
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:06,680
Hammon?

6187
03:02:08,100 --> 03:02:10,640
It has a giant thingy that you can go in.

6188
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:15,840
Okay, do we let Tempo roam free and not come back to us?

6189
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,400
And then he can try and solo rat.

6190
03:02:18,040 --> 03:02:19,920
Yeah, I gotta go find a beacon.

6191
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:20,800
Yeah.

6192
03:02:20,900 --> 03:02:21,180
Oh, wait.

6193
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:22,860
I'm so down.

6194
03:02:24,220 --> 03:02:26,120
Okay, Tempo, don't come back to us.

6195
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:28,340
Okay, do you get a beacon in Turbine?

6196
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:29,180
No.

6197
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:30,240
I don't think so.

6198
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,580
I'm gonna go steal Hammon.

6199
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:35,880
Okay, this is...

6200
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:37,660
This is the game.

6201
03:02:37,780 --> 03:02:39,540
This is the game where we get 10 points.

6202
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:44,140
This is the game where Tempo will rat until second place or some shit.

6203
03:02:44,480 --> 03:02:45,540
Yeah, that's double our points then.

6204
03:02:47,580 --> 03:02:49,320
Well, I should pick a small person.

6205
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:52,580
We already established our characters.

6206
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:54,600
What do you mean you should pick a small person?

6207
03:02:55,120 --> 03:02:55,740
What the fuck, dude?

6208
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:56,040
Let's do it.

6209
03:02:56,060 --> 03:02:56,460
Now we got this.

6210
03:02:56,480 --> 03:02:57,160
Ash, I'm Ash.

6211
03:02:57,420 --> 03:02:58,200
Yeah, you're Ash.

6212
03:02:58,300 --> 03:02:59,080
I am Conduit.

6213
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:00,400
And Tempo is...

6214
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:04,440
We just gotta trick someone into picking a character that's not there and then they get Mind Spy.

6215
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:06,280
Yeah, but they're gonna restart the game.

6216
03:03:07,180 --> 03:03:07,540
True.

6217
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:09,080
Mind Spy.

6218
03:03:09,660 --> 03:03:12,520
They're just gonna restart the game unless they are stubborn enough.

6219
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:14,960
Oh, there we go.

6220
03:03:15,220 --> 03:03:15,820
Give me Ash!

6221
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:16,820
Give me Ash!

6222
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:18,200
Oh fuck, I just broke my controller.

6223
03:03:18,360 --> 03:03:18,520
We're good.

6224
03:03:19,180 --> 03:03:20,100
Give me Ash!

6225
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:21,060
I'm locked in.

6226
03:03:21,120 --> 03:03:21,880
I'm so locked in right now.

6227
03:03:21,880 --> 03:03:22,520
We're so locked in.

6228
03:03:22,520 --> 03:03:22,820
We're here.

6229
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:23,380
We're ready.

6230
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:26,560
Alright, my face is in my screen.

6231
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:28,060
Oh, hell yeah, baby.

6232
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,480
I wish I was your screen right now.

6233
03:03:29,620 --> 03:03:30,060
Let's go!

6234
03:03:33,780 --> 03:03:34,140
Bro.

6235
03:03:34,140 --> 03:03:34,540
Bro, what?

6236
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:36,480
Can you repeat that way?

6237
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:42,100
Alright, here we go.

6238
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:43,600
Do we have anything in Turbine?

6239
03:03:44,020 --> 03:03:45,920
We have nothing in Turbine.

6240
03:03:46,020 --> 03:03:46,260
Let's go.

6241
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:50,880
We have a ring console for Tempo to scan.

6242
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:52,140
We do?

6243
03:03:52,900 --> 03:03:53,340
Yeah!

6244
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:54,160
We don't.

6245
03:03:54,720 --> 03:03:56,440
Yeah, yeah.

6246
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:57,460
You're gonna go to Hammond.

6247
03:03:57,480 --> 03:03:59,600
I gotta wait for the team to land in Hammond.

6248
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:01,080
And then I gotta steal their top loot.

6249
03:04:01,340 --> 03:04:02,800
Someone's actually taking Hammond?

6250
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:03,040
God.

6251
03:04:06,460 --> 03:04:07,640
I don't know.

6252
03:04:07,900 --> 03:04:08,420
I don't know.

6253
03:04:08,420 --> 03:04:09,860
Is that person landing top Hammond?

6254
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:11,940
Hey, why are you still with us, Tempo?

6255
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:17,260
I forgot about the shrap 30 seconds after we formulated the block.

6256
03:04:17,440 --> 03:04:20,040
Sorry, I was watching the other team.

6257
03:04:20,340 --> 03:04:20,860
We're good.

6258
03:04:22,460 --> 03:04:23,460
Too late now.

6259
03:04:23,700 --> 03:04:24,140
We're good.

6260
03:04:24,400 --> 03:04:24,840
We're good.

6261
03:04:26,140 --> 03:04:27,880
Tempo, why are you still here?

6262
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:31,320
I can't even steal your loot.

6263
03:04:31,500 --> 03:04:32,420
We literally knocked him out.

6264
03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:38,380
We're talking about the strat.

6265
03:04:39,260 --> 03:04:39,680
We're talking about the strat.

6266
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,160
How did you forget?

6267
03:04:42,420 --> 03:04:43,780
I was... I don't know.

6268
03:04:44,100 --> 03:04:46,040
You're... I love you both so much.

6269
03:04:46,140 --> 03:04:46,520
I hope you don't mind.

6270
03:04:48,540 --> 03:04:49,020
Don't worry.

6271
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:50,360
I turned around in that one game.

6272
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:51,200
Yeah, yeah.

6273
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:53,560
We're the team of the people.

6274
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:55,000
We're the team of the people, guys.

6275
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:55,320
Remember.

6276
03:04:55,880 --> 03:04:58,240
This has to be fucking somewhere near us, dude.

6277
03:04:58,340 --> 03:05:00,520
Like, this needs to be near us.

6278
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:02,040
There's just no way it's not.

6279
03:05:02,040 --> 03:05:03,380
It has to be somewhere fucking close.

6280
03:05:03,500 --> 03:05:04,140
It just has to be.

6281
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,740
Where is a beacon that we can hit?

6282
03:05:07,160 --> 03:05:07,720
Power grid.

6283
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:09,240
That's not good for us, actually.

6284
03:05:09,280 --> 03:05:10,220
That is not good for us.

6285
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:11,980
We should not go there.

6286
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:12,400
No, we should not go there.

6287
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:15,560
I think we take a gamble here.

6288
03:05:15,940 --> 03:05:16,260
Okay?

6289
03:05:16,360 --> 03:05:16,520
Yeah.

6290
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:19,320
And I think we go towards docks.

6291
03:05:20,420 --> 03:05:20,740
Okay.

6292
03:05:20,740 --> 03:05:22,160
I believe in your gambles.

6293
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:24,020
We have nothing left to lose.

6294
03:05:24,160 --> 03:05:24,980
We're literally...

6295
03:05:25,460 --> 03:05:26,860
We have nothing left to lose.

6296
03:05:26,900 --> 03:05:27,580
We have to believe.

6297
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:28,540
No, we do.

6298
03:05:28,640 --> 03:05:29,600
We have something to lose.

6299
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:30,180
We have to lose Greek, man.

6300
03:05:31,580 --> 03:05:34,080
We have one thing specifically that we can lose.

6301
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:35,520
We have only one thing to lose.

6302
03:05:35,540 --> 03:05:36,940
There's a charge rifle right here, Tempo.

6303
03:05:37,500 --> 03:05:38,240
Oh, I got one.

6304
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:40,700
Nice.

6305
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:42,220
He has the one thing he needs.

6306
03:05:42,760 --> 03:05:43,800
Wasn't there a skull person somewhere?

6307
03:05:44,680 --> 03:05:45,040
Mmm.

6308
03:05:45,860 --> 03:05:46,620
On the lambo.

6309
03:05:46,860 --> 03:05:48,060
I don't know where the skull person was.

6310
03:05:48,140 --> 03:05:48,860
I have no idea.

6311
03:05:49,020 --> 03:05:49,660
I haven't seen one.

6312
03:05:50,320 --> 03:05:51,480
They dropped it off my repeater.

6313
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:52,520
Where the fuck did I put my repeater?

6314
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:53,520
Oh my god, I'm a mess right now.

6315
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:54,580
Oh no.

6316
03:05:55,280 --> 03:05:57,740
No, you can't be a mess right now.

6317
03:05:57,800 --> 03:05:58,060
No.

6318
03:05:59,600 --> 03:06:00,080
I'm freaking out.

6319
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:00,200
I'm freaking out.

6320
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:00,760
Don't freak out.

6321
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:01,620
There's a repeater right here.

6322
03:06:01,780 --> 03:06:03,100
It's a hammer point.

6323
03:06:03,300 --> 03:06:04,160
Oh, here, here.

6324
03:06:04,960 --> 03:06:05,760
I found it.

6325
03:06:06,020 --> 03:06:06,760
I was like, good.

6326
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:07,240
I'm moving.

6327
03:06:07,660 --> 03:06:11,880
I'm so focused on the zone now that I'm just like...

6328
03:06:11,880 --> 03:06:13,620
Alright, let's go towards Docks.

6329
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:14,840
Anyone have an evac tower?

6330
03:06:15,060 --> 03:06:16,060
Any evac tower friends?

6331
03:06:16,340 --> 03:06:16,560
Nope.

6332
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:22,960
I've only had a chance to look at one evac tower and we died really early on.

6333
03:06:23,740 --> 03:06:25,140
And the drop killed us.

6334
03:06:27,160 --> 03:06:27,560
Alright.

6335
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:28,360
Ready?

6336
03:06:29,740 --> 03:06:30,840
Let's move on through, guys.

6337
03:06:31,020 --> 03:06:31,580
Let's do it.

6338
03:06:32,340 --> 03:06:32,740
Friendship.

6339
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:33,500
Yay.

6340
03:06:35,260 --> 03:06:36,300
Hey, hey, hey.

6341
03:06:36,360 --> 03:06:37,380
It's not a little more exciting.

6342
03:06:38,200 --> 03:06:38,600
Yay.

6343
03:06:40,260 --> 03:06:40,860
Wall bounce.

6344
03:06:42,060 --> 03:06:42,920
I love it.

6345
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:46,360
We're doing so well.

6346
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:46,800
We're doing so well.

6347
03:06:46,980 --> 03:06:48,060
I don't know.

6348
03:06:49,280 --> 03:06:50,660
Alright, keep on moving, guys.

6349
03:06:51,180 --> 03:06:52,240
I'm not gonna look up.

6350
03:06:52,340 --> 03:06:53,100
I'm not gonna look up.

6351
03:06:53,360 --> 03:06:54,500
No, we're good.

6352
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:55,280
We're so good.

6353
03:06:55,300 --> 03:06:55,820
I'm not gonna look up.

6354
03:06:57,060 --> 03:06:58,600
I 100% just picked the wrong perk.

6355
03:06:58,700 --> 03:06:59,000
We're good.

6356
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:00,380
I'm looking... Oh, whoa.

6357
03:07:00,760 --> 03:07:02,300
I hear an evac tower in front of us.

6358
03:07:02,440 --> 03:07:02,920
That's good.

6359
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:04,080
On me, on me.

6360
03:07:04,780 --> 03:07:05,800
Literally right on us.

6361
03:07:06,820 --> 03:07:07,820
Yeah, like, on me, on me, on me.

6362
03:07:08,260 --> 03:07:08,940
We're good, we're good, we're good.

6363
03:07:08,980 --> 03:07:09,640
Back up, back up.

6364
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,520
Keep moving, keep moving.

6365
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:11,320
Okay, okay, okay.

6366
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:12,240
They conda-queued.

6367
03:07:13,300 --> 03:07:15,080
I hear a fight to my left.

6368
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:16,020
Yeah, yeah.

6369
03:07:16,040 --> 03:07:16,820
Just keep on coming, guys.

6370
03:07:16,980 --> 03:07:18,220
Alright, I'm going, I'm walking forward.

6371
03:07:18,300 --> 03:07:18,820
I'm walking forward.

6372
03:07:18,960 --> 03:07:20,680
They're taking the thing up now.

6373
03:07:21,220 --> 03:07:21,540
That's okay.

6374
03:07:21,680 --> 03:07:22,100
We're good.

6375
03:07:22,100 --> 03:07:23,000
We're good, we're good.

6376
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:23,600
We're just chilling here.

6377
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:24,840
We're gonna move up.

6378
03:07:25,360 --> 03:07:26,040
I just want these guys to leave.

6379
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:26,540
We're good.

6380
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:27,200
They're leaving, they're leaving.

6381
03:07:27,680 --> 03:07:28,540
Alright, they're leaving?

6382
03:07:29,140 --> 03:07:29,580
I think.

6383
03:07:29,620 --> 03:07:29,960
No, on me.

6384
03:07:30,260 --> 03:07:30,820
They're not leaving.

6385
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:31,980
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6386
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:32,340
What are they doing?

6387
03:07:34,040 --> 03:07:35,340
These guys are stressing me the fuck out.

6388
03:07:35,940 --> 03:07:36,200
Bamboozled.

6389
03:07:36,320 --> 03:07:37,340
Okay, come follow me, follow me, follow me.

6390
03:07:37,400 --> 03:07:37,640
You guys coming?

6391
03:07:38,140 --> 03:07:38,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6392
03:07:39,060 --> 03:07:40,160
There's a... There's a Watsonfest.

6393
03:07:40,220 --> 03:07:40,740
There's a Watsonfest.

6394
03:07:40,780 --> 03:07:41,260
There's a Watsonfest.

6395
03:07:41,360 --> 03:07:43,100
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

6396
03:07:43,320 --> 03:07:45,300
We gotta send it, we gotta send it.

6397
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:46,240
Believe in me, believe in me.

6398
03:07:46,320 --> 03:07:46,620
Believe in me.

6399
03:07:46,640 --> 03:07:47,460
I'm believing, I'm believing, I'm believing.

6400
03:07:47,460 --> 03:07:47,680
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

6401
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:47,680
We're good.

6402
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:47,680
Come on.

6403
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:47,680
Oh, you guys are believing!

6404
03:07:47,960 --> 03:07:48,120
We're good, I'm believing!

6405
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:50,040
Okay, coming, coming, coming, coming!

6406
03:07:50,320 --> 03:07:50,580
We're good.

6407
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:51,800
I'm climbing, I'm climbing, climbing, climbing!

6408
03:07:52,020 --> 03:07:53,160
We're good, just play slow.

6409
03:07:53,300 --> 03:07:53,920
We're vibing.

6410
03:07:53,960 --> 03:07:55,240
We could play this pillar too, if we need to.

6411
03:07:55,300 --> 03:07:56,100
We're okay, we're dead.

6412
03:07:56,380 --> 03:07:58,260
Okay, uh, I'm going to leave.

6413
03:07:58,280 --> 03:07:59,480
The pillar is safe.

6414
03:07:59,560 --> 03:08:00,580
Go to the pillar, go to the pillar!

6415
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:01,040
Yeah, I'm dead.

6416
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:03,480
I'm good on life.

6417
03:08:03,660 --> 03:08:04,120
I'm alive.

6418
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:04,520
I'm gonna die.

6419
03:08:04,520 --> 03:08:04,520
I'm alive, I think.

6420
03:08:04,780 --> 03:08:05,160
I'm dead!

6421
03:08:05,460 --> 03:08:08,040
I think, I think, I'm alive, we're crowned alive!

6422
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:08,920
Okay, I'm batting.

6423
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:10,660
We're okay, just play slow.

6424
03:08:10,960 --> 03:08:11,520
Play slow.

6425
03:08:11,520 --> 03:08:14,160
Okay, there's a fence to our left here too.

6426
03:08:14,180 --> 03:08:14,180
We got a problem.

6427
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:15,080
We got vibing.

6428
03:08:15,440 --> 03:08:16,380
Just vibed, guys.

6429
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:17,060
We're so good.

6430
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:17,800
Oh, I'm so good.

6431
03:08:17,860 --> 03:08:18,540
I feel so healthy.

6432
03:08:18,740 --> 03:08:19,000
We're so good.

6433
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:19,620
We're so fine.

6434
03:08:19,620 --> 03:08:21,140
I feel very healthy right now.

6435
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:23,840
I'm so vibing, it's not even funny, guys.

6436
03:08:23,900 --> 03:08:24,440
Oh my god.

6437
03:08:24,880 --> 03:08:25,240
I'm dead.

6438
03:08:25,240 --> 03:08:25,360
I'm dead.

6439
03:08:25,460 --> 03:08:25,960
We're alive.

6440
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:26,340
I'm good, guys.

6441
03:08:26,620 --> 03:08:26,980
No, no, no.

6442
03:08:26,980 --> 03:08:27,360
You're good.

6443
03:08:27,420 --> 03:08:27,720
You're good.

6444
03:08:27,740 --> 03:08:28,080
You're good.

6445
03:08:28,540 --> 03:08:29,620
I'm looking to my right.

6446
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:33,180
I'm alive.

6447
03:08:33,360 --> 03:08:33,660
I'm dead.

6448
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:35,440
We're okay, I think.

6449
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:37,320
Oh, this is the... I don't know, man.

6450
03:08:37,400 --> 03:08:39,100
I don't feel very comfortable here.

6451
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:40,600
I feel very exposed for some reason.

6452
03:08:40,600 --> 03:08:42,700
We're gonna wait for my ulti and try to go up here.

6453
03:08:42,800 --> 03:08:43,120
Okay.

6454
03:08:43,560 --> 03:08:44,200
On that house.

6455
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:45,180
But you guys stay here.

6456
03:08:45,320 --> 03:08:45,460
I'm gonna...

6457
03:08:45,460 --> 03:08:47,120
There's people literally right here.

6458
03:08:48,120 --> 03:08:49,000
Oh my god.

6459
03:08:49,060 --> 03:08:49,960
What is this Mirage doing?

6460
03:08:50,080 --> 03:08:51,320
How is he able to sit out here, man?

6461
03:08:51,780 --> 03:08:54,120
I'm just saying there's people right here above me.

6462
03:08:54,740 --> 03:08:55,380
Okay, that's fine.

6463
03:08:55,460 --> 03:08:55,820
We're good.

6464
03:08:55,880 --> 03:08:56,500
We're vibing.

6465
03:08:56,500 --> 03:08:57,420
We're just...

6466
03:09:01,900 --> 03:09:02,380
We're good.

6467
03:09:02,500 --> 03:09:02,760
We're good.

6468
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:03,040
We're good.

6469
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:03,720
Just stay low.

6470
03:09:04,900 --> 03:09:05,540
Chill out.

6471
03:09:05,800 --> 03:09:06,260
Yeah, man.

6472
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:08,440
I'm stressed the fuck out.

6473
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:09,940
I'm so stressed out.

6474
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:10,660
I'm so stressed out.

6475
03:09:10,660 --> 03:09:11,960
But we're not 20th.

6476
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:13,400
We're not 20th.

6477
03:09:13,800 --> 03:09:15,040
Yeah, but we need to...

6478
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:16,180
Wow, pro.

6479
03:09:16,280 --> 03:09:18,240
How are these kids able to peek this?

6480
03:09:18,960 --> 03:09:20,060
I'm so lost.

6481
03:09:20,560 --> 03:09:21,700
How people are able to do this.

6482
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:23,920
It's okay.

6483
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:24,260
We're good.

6484
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:25,240
Tembo, you're good where you're at.

6485
03:09:25,360 --> 03:09:25,660
You're fine.

6486
03:09:26,140 --> 03:09:27,000
Tembo, move up more here.

6487
03:09:27,100 --> 03:09:27,720
Here, right?

6488
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:29,320
One place low.

6489
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:30,060
Tembo, just don't.

6490
03:09:31,940 --> 03:09:32,700
We're good, guys.

6491
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:35,380
How are these teams able to do this to us?

6492
03:09:35,900 --> 03:09:36,980
I'm getting harassed.

6493
03:09:36,980 --> 03:09:38,120
Tembo, please save us.

6494
03:09:38,540 --> 03:09:40,220
How are they able to get these angles?

6495
03:09:40,560 --> 03:09:41,200
I'm getting harassed.

6496
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:42,180
Why is no one here?

6497
03:09:42,500 --> 03:09:43,360
I'm getting harassed.

6498
03:09:43,700 --> 03:09:45,200
I'm getting harassed right now.

6499
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:46,460
You're good.

6500
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:46,840
You're good.

6501
03:09:46,840 --> 03:09:47,100
You're good.

6502
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:47,740
I'm looking for you.

6503
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:48,520
I'm pre-firing.

6504
03:09:48,620 --> 03:09:49,100
No one's there.

6505
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:50,920
There's no safe.

6506
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:51,680
There's no silver.

6507
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:54,540
Tembo, gray fences, kid.

6508
03:09:54,700 --> 03:09:55,680
Don't fucking shoot them.

6509
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,900
Gray fences, kid.

6510
03:09:57,960 --> 03:09:59,820
They don't shoot us.

6511
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:01,520
Do I stay here?

6512
03:10:02,580 --> 03:10:03,300
Stay there.

6513
03:10:03,360 --> 03:10:03,840
Stay there.

6514
03:10:05,060 --> 03:10:05,600
Don't stay there.

6515
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:06,040
Don't stay there.

6516
03:10:06,120 --> 03:10:06,620
Come on.

6517
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:06,920
Come on.

6518
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:07,480
Come on.

6519
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:11,160
How are you getting shot?

6520
03:10:11,260 --> 03:10:12,740
Where are you getting shot from?

6521
03:10:12,740 --> 03:10:13,320
I don't know!

6522
03:10:14,140 --> 03:10:15,540
How is this possible?

6523
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:16,720
No!

6524
03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:19,460
Everywhere I go...

6525
03:10:20,240 --> 03:10:21,180
There's hoes on us!

6526
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:23,460
Dude, I'm so bad!

6527
03:10:24,220 --> 03:10:26,060
A building would be nice.

6528
03:10:26,540 --> 03:10:28,400
A building would be fantastic right now.

6529
03:10:28,460 --> 03:10:30,620
We just take the car and eat a building?

6530
03:10:31,180 --> 03:10:32,220
No, you guys stay here.

6531
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:33,200
I'm gonna try to figure something out.

6532
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:33,560
Stay here.

6533
03:10:33,940 --> 03:10:36,000
This team above us must have so much space.

6534
03:10:36,080 --> 03:10:36,800
That's why they're doing this.

6535
03:10:37,400 --> 03:10:39,260
There's no way they're able to... there's no way.

6536
03:10:39,420 --> 03:10:41,180
I'm so scared, man.

6537
03:10:41,180 --> 03:10:42,820
We're actually lowkey not awful.

6538
03:10:42,960 --> 03:10:43,660
Like I'm being honest.

6539
03:10:44,620 --> 03:10:46,740
I was literally in the worst spot possible.

6540
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:47,600
No, no.

6541
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:48,560
This spot where I'm at is good.

6542
03:10:49,240 --> 03:10:51,540
Okay, I'm... I'm okay now.

6543
03:10:51,700 --> 03:10:53,300
I'm not... I'm not panicking anymore.

6544
03:10:53,300 --> 03:10:54,320
Guys, I've calmed down.

6545
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:55,360
I've calmed down.

6546
03:10:55,360 --> 03:10:55,800
Hell yeah!

6547
03:10:55,900 --> 03:10:56,240
Did you?

6548
03:10:56,300 --> 03:10:56,560
Did you?

6549
03:10:57,780 --> 03:10:59,180
Guys, guys, you just threw up everywhere.

6550
03:10:59,220 --> 03:11:00,380
Guys, I'm chilling now, guys.

6551
03:11:01,460 --> 03:11:03,400
Guys, guys, I'm not anxious anymore.

6552
03:11:03,500 --> 03:11:04,040
I'm okay now.

6553
03:11:04,100 --> 03:11:04,560
I've calmed down.

6554
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,080
After all that, I'm good.

6555
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:07,080
I'm not stressed anymore, guys.

6556
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:11,000
I think I feel like a better... I feel like a...

6557
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:11,880
Much better person.

6558
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:17,740
You know what?

6559
03:11:17,800 --> 03:11:18,100
You know what?

6560
03:11:18,320 --> 03:11:19,580
Maybe this spot is doable.

6561
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:20,240
You know?

6562
03:11:20,900 --> 03:11:25,400
I'm telling you right now, if we lay low, like you guys just don't peek, no one's gonna think someone's playing.

6563
03:11:25,420 --> 03:11:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6564
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:27,060
No, no, yeah, exactly.

6565
03:11:27,080 --> 03:11:28,700
Not all of these Watson fences.

6566
03:11:28,980 --> 03:11:29,180
Yeah.

6567
03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:31,340
Who the fuck would play here, bro?

6568
03:11:31,460 --> 03:11:31,820
Honestly.

6569
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:33,360
Yeah, yeah.

6570
03:11:33,580 --> 03:11:35,740
Who the fuck put all these Watson fences there?

6571
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:36,500
There's nobody here.

6572
03:11:37,500 --> 03:11:38,820
I'm gonna... I'm gonna be honest, guys.

6573
03:11:38,940 --> 03:11:42,020
If there's one thing I took today from all these games...

6574
03:11:42,020 --> 03:11:45,480
In order for challenges to work, I gotta step my eyes yelling out, holy fuck.

6575
03:11:46,300 --> 03:11:47,320
Oh my god.

6576
03:11:47,640 --> 03:11:48,600
I am rusty.

6577
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:50,300
I think we all are.

6578
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:52,780
We are all definitely rusty, I will admit.

6579
03:11:53,640 --> 03:11:54,240
Wait, okay.

6580
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:56,200
I just wanna know, is Greek's team dead?

6581
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:57,440
I hope.

6582
03:11:57,560 --> 03:11:57,980
Is that...

6583
03:11:57,980 --> 03:11:58,820
I haven't seen it.

6584
03:11:58,900 --> 03:12:00,020
I haven't seen 14 yet.

6585
03:12:00,220 --> 03:12:01,560
Oh, we haven't seen... No, fuck.

6586
03:12:01,620 --> 03:12:02,380
Okay, he's still alive.

6587
03:12:02,800 --> 03:12:03,900
So bad for us, guys.

6588
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:04,420
That's so bad.

6589
03:12:04,460 --> 03:12:05,040
He's still alive.

6590
03:12:07,080 --> 03:12:08,140
We need to look at team 14.

6591
03:12:08,140 --> 03:12:10,820
The only issue here that I'm... The only issue we have, like, genuinely...

6592
03:12:10,820 --> 03:12:16,040
Is if this team above us just... The zone, like, pulls up more and they're the only team inside docks...

6593
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:17,240
Then they could... Oh, they're not.

6594
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:17,840
They're getting shot at.

6595
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:18,160
That's good.

6596
03:12:18,240 --> 03:12:18,600
Oh, nice.

6597
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:18,920
That's good.

6598
03:12:18,960 --> 03:12:19,120
That's good.

6599
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:20,180
Yeah.

6600
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:20,660
That's good.

6601
03:12:20,700 --> 03:12:20,940
We're fine.

6602
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:21,880
We're so healthy.

6603
03:12:23,240 --> 03:12:24,040
That's a great chat.

6604
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:25,180
That's a great one.

6605
03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:26,720
Everybody knows we're here now, too.

6606
03:12:26,820 --> 03:12:27,160
So that's okay.

6607
03:12:27,160 --> 03:12:27,420
No, it's fine.

6608
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:27,800
That's great.

6609
03:12:27,900 --> 03:12:28,280
That's great.

6610
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:28,640
That's great.

6611
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:28,640
That's great.

6612
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:30,020
We're creating presence now, right?

6613
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:30,860
Now we want presence.

6614
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:31,960
Yeah, and now we want presence.

6615
03:12:31,980 --> 03:12:32,340
Yeah.

6616
03:12:32,380 --> 03:12:32,660
Yeah.

6617
03:12:32,660 --> 03:12:32,900
Like Santa.

6618
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:33,880
Yeah, I'm learning.

6619
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:34,660
I'm learning from your IGL.

6620
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:36,140
Now we want people to know we're here.

6621
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:36,880
Good.

6622
03:12:36,960 --> 03:12:38,020
You're doing so good.

6623
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:38,640
I'm sorry.

6624
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:40,620
I'm sorry.

6625
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:43,340
I'm just gonna stay here still.

6626
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:45,260
I'm gonna stay here.

6627
03:12:45,540 --> 03:12:46,540
There's people all over the room.

6628
03:12:46,540 --> 03:12:48,820
To be fair though, we did get fucked over like pretty hard again.

6629
03:12:48,940 --> 03:12:49,640
Like every time.

6630
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:54,060
I think like... I think everybody bullied us out of a good POI.

6631
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:56,000
That's exactly what it is.

6632
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:58,260
I think that's what happened.

6633
03:12:58,640 --> 03:12:59,560
Oh, my Ruchai.

6634
03:12:59,620 --> 03:13:01,300
Everybody just kicked us out.

6635
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:03,660
They're like, okay, nice week, put Geyser.

6636
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:04,960
They're like, uh, all right.

6637
03:13:04,980 --> 03:13:05,660
Yeah, they could have that.

6638
03:13:05,740 --> 03:13:06,620
They're like, nice week, put Geyser.

6639
03:13:06,740 --> 03:13:08,120
They're like, all right, we'll take that for them.

6640
03:13:08,800 --> 03:13:10,280
They're like, oh, it's nice week.

6641
03:13:10,340 --> 03:13:10,600
Yeah.

6642
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:11,280
I think that's on there.

6643
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:12,620
I mean...

6644
03:13:13,380 --> 03:13:14,420
They don't even have a pro on their team.

6645
03:13:14,560 --> 03:13:15,420
Yeah, they don't even have a pro.

6646
03:13:15,540 --> 03:13:18,280
They literally have a Plat 4 and a Diamond 3.

6647
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:19,220
And another Plat.

6648
03:13:19,540 --> 03:13:20,500
And another Plat.

6649
03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:24,020
They literally had three Plat players.

6650
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:26,140
Okay, here's the moment of truth, guys.

6651
03:13:27,400 --> 03:13:28,820
Why is team 14 still?

6652
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:31,620
Wait, but this is your tournament.

6653
03:13:31,680 --> 03:13:33,840
How did you let these people fucking...

6654
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:34,940
Oh, my God.

6655
03:13:35,560 --> 03:13:37,040
The zone pulls back.

6656
03:13:37,420 --> 03:13:39,380
Okay, this is gonna be the craziest thing I ever said.

6657
03:13:39,380 --> 03:13:41,040
We should get middle of fight night.

6658
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:42,720
Like, inside fight night?

6659
03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:42,960
Yes.

6660
03:13:43,300 --> 03:13:44,740
How do we run past everybody?

6661
03:13:45,540 --> 03:13:47,780
I mean, I get this vehicle, we queue in there.

6662
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:48,660
Or I boost in there.

6663
03:13:49,260 --> 03:13:50,240
Okay, do we do it now?

6664
03:13:50,480 --> 03:13:50,800
Now?

6665
03:13:50,980 --> 03:13:51,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

6666
03:13:51,700 --> 03:13:52,480
Come with me, Donkey.

6667
03:13:52,480 --> 03:13:52,840
Come over here.

6668
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:53,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6669
03:13:53,340 --> 03:13:54,020
Get right where tempo is.

6670
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:54,820
Okay.

6671
03:13:57,360 --> 03:13:57,680
Okay.

6672
03:13:58,280 --> 03:14:00,860
I have an Ashport, but I think we should go for the Trident, because it's funnier.

6673
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:01,300
Okay.

6674
03:14:02,400 --> 03:14:03,200
Okay, I'm ready.

6675
03:14:03,220 --> 03:14:03,780
Jesus Christ.

6676
03:14:03,880 --> 03:14:05,940
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

6677
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:07,380
Boost, boost, boost, boost.

6678
03:14:07,620 --> 03:14:08,400
Wait, it's only the boost.

6679
03:14:09,180 --> 03:14:10,820
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

6680
03:14:11,640 --> 03:14:12,720
No, I got to kill you.

6681
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:14,220
It's a whole squad.

6682
03:14:14,840 --> 03:14:15,820
Why is there a whole squad there?

6683
03:14:15,820 --> 03:14:16,100
You run.

6684
03:14:16,100 --> 03:14:17,380
Get away, Donkey, get away.

6685
03:14:17,640 --> 03:14:17,820
I'm in.

6686
03:14:17,980 --> 03:14:18,700
You can crack this.

6687
03:14:18,780 --> 03:14:19,000
Run.

6688
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:22,240
I'm getting punch already.

6689
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:24,360
What?

6690
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:26,680
Why is there a whole team?

6691
03:14:26,680 --> 03:14:27,240
I'm taking the port.

6692
03:14:27,360 --> 03:14:27,900
I'm taking the port.

6693
03:14:28,300 --> 03:14:28,800
Oh, wait.

6694
03:14:28,940 --> 03:14:29,540
That's not it.

6695
03:14:29,680 --> 03:14:31,900
Why is there a whole team?

6696
03:14:32,200 --> 03:14:33,640
Is there a team in this?

6697
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:33,760
I'm not taking a hold of that.

6698
03:14:34,320 --> 03:14:36,580
There is already a full team inside!

6699
03:14:36,960 --> 03:14:39,340
Wig, I don't think we should have done that, Wig.

6700
03:14:39,340 --> 03:14:39,940
Where is Wig?

6701
03:14:40,220 --> 03:14:41,020
Wait, where is he?

6702
03:14:41,080 --> 03:14:41,300
You live?

6703
03:14:42,740 --> 03:14:44,360
You might be able to craft that.

6704
03:14:44,360 --> 03:14:45,420
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.

6705
03:14:45,640 --> 03:14:45,920
Okay.

6706
03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:49,280
All I'm saying is that, Wig...

6707
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:49,900
We're craftable.

6708
03:14:49,900 --> 03:14:52,260
I think you might have made the wrong decision.

6709
03:14:52,880 --> 03:14:55,740
I mean, why is there a full team with an Arcstar there?

6710
03:14:56,140 --> 03:14:56,580
Why?

6711
03:14:57,260 --> 03:14:58,820
Someone please tell me why.

6712
03:15:00,980 --> 03:15:02,180
That is unbelievable.

6713
03:15:03,280 --> 03:15:04,660
Wait, you have no white bats?

6714
03:15:04,840 --> 03:15:05,220
No!

6715
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:06,540
You have zero?

6716
03:15:07,060 --> 03:15:07,960
We're like a turbine!

6717
03:15:08,960 --> 03:15:10,080
I have nothing!

6718
03:15:10,680 --> 03:15:12,060
How do you have no zero?

6719
03:15:12,140 --> 03:15:12,920
Wait, wait, wait.

6720
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:14,040
You just gotta last...

6721
03:15:14,040 --> 03:15:15,580
until 14 dies.

6722
03:15:15,940 --> 03:15:16,180
14 dies!

6723
03:15:16,180 --> 03:15:16,460
14 dies!

6724
03:15:16,460 --> 03:15:16,460
14 dies!

6725
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:17,480
Nothing matters anymore!

6726
03:15:17,800 --> 03:15:17,920
You did?

6727
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:18,940
Nothing matters!

6728
03:15:19,140 --> 03:15:19,840
We're both green!

6729
03:15:19,840 --> 03:15:21,060
14 is dead, nothing matters!

6730
03:15:21,140 --> 03:15:21,740
Wait, wait, wait.

6731
03:15:21,880 --> 03:15:23,000
We can beat Deeds.

6732
03:15:23,120 --> 03:15:23,980
If you get...

6733
03:15:26,480 --> 03:15:27,840
12, 9, 7, 5.

6734
03:15:28,140 --> 03:15:30,000
If you get top 5, we beat Deeds.

6735
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:31,040
Okay.

6736
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:31,700
Second.

6737
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:32,160
Second.

6738
03:15:32,180 --> 03:15:33,380
The person above us.

6739
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:36,800
The person above us.

6740
03:15:36,800 --> 03:15:38,600
The person of the team above us.

6741
03:15:38,660 --> 03:15:39,720
If we beat...

6742
03:15:42,920 --> 03:15:43,720
Oh my god.

6743
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:45,720
The fucking riskiest reload of your life.

6744
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:47,820
After the audio play, there's no idea where I'm at.

6745
03:15:48,980 --> 03:15:50,340
You're listening to me right now.

6746
03:15:51,380 --> 03:15:57,460
You know, maybe we should not listen to something that was like, but it would be so funny.

6747
03:15:57,660 --> 03:15:58,720
Like maybe that's just not...

6748
03:15:58,720 --> 03:15:59,000
But content.

6749
03:15:59,740 --> 03:16:02,160
Yeah, but like, who else smiled during that?

6750
03:16:02,180 --> 03:16:02,960
No one else?

6751
03:16:03,180 --> 03:16:03,720
We did.

6752
03:16:03,740 --> 03:16:04,420
I got stuck.

6753
03:16:04,780 --> 03:16:05,680
I got hurt.

6754
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:07,380
You got fucked over.

6755
03:16:07,520 --> 03:16:09,300
Wait, you got stuck or our car got stuck?

6756
03:16:09,420 --> 03:16:10,260
Because I got hit too.

6757
03:16:10,480 --> 03:16:10,560
I got stuck.

6758
03:16:10,780 --> 03:16:12,800
Oh, maybe our car got hit and all of us...

6759
03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:14,260
No, why are you peeking?

6760
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:15,500
Why are you looking at me?

6761
03:16:15,500 --> 03:16:18,380
I didn't know if there was the inside button or if I'm going in there and scrapping.

6762
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:19,300
You're literally...

6763
03:16:19,300 --> 03:16:20,600
Look at your heels!

6764
03:16:21,300 --> 03:16:25,260
The fact that you have the confidence to even look at somebody.

6765
03:16:27,240 --> 03:16:29,320
At least I was getting top 10.

6766
03:16:30,460 --> 03:16:32,160
I'm fucking dead in this next zone.

6767
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:32,580
Don't look down, for sure.

6768
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:34,360
You don't know that.

6769
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:35,960
Oh.

6770
03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:37,920
You can craft us...

6771
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:39,420
You can craft us in the north?

6772
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:39,620
Oh...

6773
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:39,640
Wait a minute.

6774
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:41,040
Craft you?

6775
03:16:41,500 --> 03:16:41,940
Yay!

6776
03:16:42,440 --> 03:16:43,920
Wait, okay, if he crafts us, where is he going to rez?

6777
03:16:43,920 --> 03:16:45,440
No, you're telling me, that's not delusional?

6778
03:16:46,240 --> 03:16:47,180
That's not delusional?

6779
03:16:47,300 --> 03:16:47,580
Come on.

6780
03:16:47,900 --> 03:16:49,800
Where is he going to rez, Tempo?

6781
03:16:50,640 --> 03:16:53,700
I should realistically die to storm here, so I don't give deeds a kill.

6782
03:16:54,220 --> 03:16:55,060
Find a move.

6783
03:16:55,420 --> 03:16:56,960
Do you know, wait.

6784
03:16:57,580 --> 03:16:59,700
Tempo didn't even know CC was next week.

6785
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:01,080
He thought it was the week after.

6786
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:02,140
But I...

6787
03:17:02,140 --> 03:17:02,580
Oh, I thought so too.

6788
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:03,860
Oh wait, what the fuck you do?

6789
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:08,820
I thought it too, holy shit.

6790
03:17:10,560 --> 03:17:12,160
I did not know we were playing next week.

6791
03:17:12,220 --> 03:17:13,420
I do not have enough time to prep for that.

6792
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:15,940
We are playing next week, guys!

6793
03:17:16,200 --> 03:17:16,880
Oh, we're so fucked.

6794
03:17:17,020 --> 03:17:18,000
This is good, this is good.

6795
03:17:18,080 --> 03:17:18,620
People are dying.

6796
03:17:19,800 --> 03:17:20,420
There's no one middle.

6797
03:17:20,500 --> 03:17:20,920
Do I go middle?

6798
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:22,140
Inside?

6799
03:17:22,660 --> 03:17:24,040
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

6800
03:17:24,040 --> 03:17:25,360
Do it and then like there might be heals.

6801
03:17:25,420 --> 03:17:30,000
There's heals, there's my box on my left.

6802
03:17:30,040 --> 03:17:31,000
On the left, that's me, that's me.

6803
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:32,480
Right, right, right, right, here, right, here, right.

6804
03:17:32,620 --> 03:17:33,960
Here, behind you, that's my box.

6805
03:17:34,100 --> 03:17:35,740
I know, I'm nervous about them punching me in the face.

6806
03:17:36,340 --> 03:17:36,840
Just heal.

6807
03:17:38,320 --> 03:17:39,020
There's heals here.

6808
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:41,420
No, you can't heal inside.

6809
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:42,540
No, you can.

6810
03:17:43,400 --> 03:17:44,780
Yeah, yeah, what the fuck do you mean?

6811
03:17:44,960 --> 03:17:45,440
I put...

6812
03:17:45,440 --> 03:17:45,780
Hey, chill.

6813
03:17:46,040 --> 03:17:47,020
Nadi, chill, Nadi, chill.

6814
03:17:47,380 --> 03:17:48,540
Just leave, just leave, just leave.

6815
03:17:48,580 --> 03:17:49,300
Just heal, just heal.

6816
03:17:49,620 --> 03:17:50,380
It's... you have time.

6817
03:17:50,380 --> 03:17:51,200
I know, but they're gonna push.

6818
03:17:51,220 --> 03:17:52,180
They're gonna come in here and...

6819
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:53,320
They're not gonna push.

6820
03:17:53,320 --> 03:17:54,520
And the other team's gonna come in there.

6821
03:17:54,780 --> 03:17:56,580
Yeah, and then you watch these two come inside.

6822
03:17:56,980 --> 03:17:57,920
Hey, they scare each other out.

6823
03:17:58,140 --> 03:17:58,680
You're safe.

6824
03:17:59,180 --> 03:18:00,080
Yeah, yeah, there's...

6825
03:18:00,080 --> 03:18:02,940
No one can come in because the moment they come in, someone else will come in.

6826
03:18:02,980 --> 03:18:03,300
Yeah.

6827
03:18:03,880 --> 03:18:04,620
It's a scare tactic.

6828
03:18:04,820 --> 03:18:06,400
Oh, they're just trying to scare you.

6829
03:18:06,460 --> 03:18:07,260
I'm fucking dead, I'm fucking dead.

6830
03:18:07,420 --> 03:18:07,720
They're trying to scare you.

6831
03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:08,840
Oh my god.

6832
03:18:09,160 --> 03:18:10,920
What the fuck just happened to me?

6833
03:18:13,240 --> 03:18:14,040
Top 10!

6834
03:18:14,560 --> 03:18:15,160
Let's go!

6835
03:18:16,540 --> 03:18:17,440
You got lost.

6836
03:18:17,440 --> 03:18:17,840
Both points.

6837
03:18:18,860 --> 03:18:21,100
You got lost so hard.

6838
03:18:21,160 --> 03:18:22,540
What the fuck was that?

6839
03:18:22,860 --> 03:18:23,820
What just happened to me?

6840
03:18:23,980 --> 03:18:25,260
What was that?

6841
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:26,720
I'm being crazy though.

6842
03:18:26,740 --> 03:18:27,620
Top 10 show gets me.

6843
03:18:27,620 --> 03:18:27,920
Look at that.

6844
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:28,620
No, it's okay.

6845
03:18:28,680 --> 03:18:29,700
We're above Greek.

6846
03:18:30,240 --> 03:18:31,300
Oh my god.

6847
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:33,080
We actually got arced in the car.

6848
03:18:33,400 --> 03:18:34,520
We're above Greek.

6849
03:18:34,620 --> 03:18:35,680
That's all that matters.

6850
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:36,240
Man.

6851
03:18:36,520 --> 03:18:37,600
You know what crazy there?

6852
03:18:37,720 --> 03:18:41,080
If that team's just not there to stick with an R star, we actually probably could get like top five again.

6853
03:18:41,180 --> 03:18:41,680
Yeah, we could.

6854
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:43,120
It's actually insane how bad our luck is.

6855
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:43,440
It's unreal.

6856
03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:43,820
Yeah.

6857
03:18:44,660 --> 03:18:47,800
I'm just saying, wait, the next time you headline...

6858
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:48,320
Yeah.

6859
03:18:48,700 --> 03:18:49,920
No, I call POIs.

6860
03:18:49,980 --> 03:18:51,000
I'm getting the POI out of here.

6861
03:18:51,080 --> 03:18:52,140
Next time you have an idea.

6862
03:18:53,560 --> 03:18:57,420
Next time you have an idea, go against that idea as well.

6863
03:18:58,140 --> 03:18:59,380
Yo, what the...

6864
03:19:00,780 --> 03:19:02,800
Every idea I have, just make it the opposite.

6865
03:19:06,620 --> 03:19:07,560
That is insane.

6866
03:19:07,780 --> 03:19:12,120
I can't believe the headliner got bullied out of their POI.

6867
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:13,540
That is insane.

6868
03:19:14,100 --> 03:19:14,180
I am.

6869
03:19:17,220 --> 03:19:22,780
To be fair, it's good that we got, you know, it's good that we finally got team practice, you know?

6870
03:19:23,120 --> 03:19:23,560
100%.

6871
03:19:24,020 --> 03:19:29,600
Because if we didn't before Challenger Circuit, I think it would have been even worse.

6872
03:19:29,600 --> 03:19:31,360
Wait, what are we playing for Challenger Circuit?

6873
03:19:31,780 --> 03:19:35,160
I mean, listen, my brain is fried after these six games.

6874
03:19:35,660 --> 03:19:41,060
I just told us to get in three-man Trident and boost into Fight Nightlight.

6875
03:19:41,340 --> 03:19:44,020
I mean, am I really capable of IGLing anyone at this point?

6876
03:19:48,300 --> 03:19:52,100
Okay, but also remember where you took us before we were in the Trident.

6877
03:19:53,420 --> 03:19:54,340
That was even...

6878
03:19:54,340 --> 03:19:55,300
We were...

6879
03:19:55,300 --> 03:19:56,680
I think we were safe down there.

6880
03:19:56,780 --> 03:19:57,420
I think too.

6881
03:19:57,480 --> 03:19:59,180
If the zone pulled off, we were good.

6882
03:19:59,320 --> 03:19:59,580
I didn't know that.

6883
03:19:59,580 --> 03:20:00,520
I did not feel safe.

6884
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:03,680
I mean, if we just had a fucking beacon.

6885
03:20:03,940 --> 03:20:05,980
I did not feel safe at all.

6886
03:20:05,980 --> 03:20:06,440
One time today.

6887
03:20:06,660 --> 03:20:07,920
One time we had a...

6888
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:12,060
Do you understand that in order to get a beacon today, we just had to send Tempo over to Harvester?

6889
03:20:12,660 --> 03:20:14,080
That was the only time we had a beacon.

6890
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:19,820
We just dropped a literal manager of an esports team solo out of the OI to get a beacon.

6891
03:20:19,960 --> 03:20:21,600
We didn't get a single beacon.

6892
03:20:21,620 --> 03:20:22,860
That's actually crazy.

6893
03:20:23,380 --> 03:20:24,240
That is crazy.

6894
03:20:24,760 --> 03:20:27,880
All six games we had zero beacons.

6895
03:20:28,220 --> 03:20:29,560
We just played this game on all six.

6896
03:20:29,560 --> 03:20:31,380
It was a hard difficulty, literally veteran mode.

6897
03:20:32,040 --> 03:20:33,320
And it fucking back again.

6898
03:20:33,440 --> 03:20:33,980
God damn it.

6899
03:20:34,940 --> 03:20:35,480
Fuck me.

6900
03:20:36,100 --> 03:20:37,120
That's actually insane.

6901
03:20:37,820 --> 03:20:38,300
That's insane.

6902
03:20:38,520 --> 03:20:38,860
That's insane.

6903
03:20:39,060 --> 03:20:39,340
That's insane.

6904
03:20:41,880 --> 03:20:43,160
We had one game of beacon, right?

6905
03:20:43,220 --> 03:20:43,560
What was it?

6906
03:20:43,660 --> 03:20:44,380
No, we didn't.

6907
03:20:44,380 --> 03:20:45,940
We had to walk over to the beacon.

6908
03:20:46,120 --> 03:20:46,460
We...

6909
03:20:46,460 --> 03:20:47,040
Oh, no, no.

6910
03:20:47,140 --> 03:20:47,900
We had one at Jurassic.

6911
03:20:48,020 --> 03:20:49,040
Oh, we had Jurassic.

6912
03:20:49,040 --> 03:20:49,400
Yeah.

6913
03:20:49,480 --> 03:20:50,460
One out of five, baby.

6914
03:20:50,860 --> 03:20:51,760
One out of five.

6915
03:20:52,840 --> 03:20:54,700
Didn't we get fucked over in Jurassic still?

6916
03:20:55,380 --> 03:20:55,740
No.

6917
03:20:55,840 --> 03:20:56,400
No, we didn't.

6918
03:20:56,420 --> 03:20:56,620
We didn't.

6919
03:20:56,640 --> 03:20:57,400
We did pretty well.

6920
03:20:57,520 --> 03:20:58,140
We did pretty well.

6921
03:20:58,140 --> 03:20:59,440
No, we just needed a catwalk.

6922
03:20:59,540 --> 03:21:00,400
We would have made like top 5.

6923
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:02,080
That's my bad.

6924
03:21:03,460 --> 03:21:04,700
We had a...

6925
03:21:04,700 --> 03:21:05,780
You know what?

6926
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:08,940
In the end, we had a good vibe.

6927
03:21:09,900 --> 03:21:11,940
Honestly, I actually had so much fun today.

6928
03:21:12,220 --> 03:21:13,920
I'm just glad we weren't last.

6929
03:21:14,560 --> 03:21:15,340
Wait, wait, guys.

6930
03:21:15,520 --> 03:21:16,400
We're better than Reptar.

6931
03:21:16,720 --> 03:21:20,700
In the end, Reptar was rank 1 last season.

6932
03:21:21,080 --> 03:21:22,780
And we were...

6933
03:21:23,300 --> 03:21:25,280
Our team did better than him.

6934
03:21:25,880 --> 03:21:26,980
You're so fucking right.

6935
03:21:26,980 --> 03:21:30,300
We technically beat the rank 1 Pred.

6936
03:21:30,460 --> 03:21:31,660
So are we rank 1?

6937
03:21:31,900 --> 03:21:36,620
We beat rank 1 Pred as a Plat team.

6938
03:21:36,880 --> 03:21:37,700
Just remember that.

6939
03:21:39,500 --> 03:21:40,260
That's what I'm saying.

6940
03:21:41,620 --> 03:21:42,580
Hey, Full...

6941
03:21:42,580 --> 03:21:43,100
What's up?

6942
03:21:43,140 --> 03:21:43,920
You're in Platinum right now?

6943
03:21:44,440 --> 03:21:44,920
What?

6944
03:21:45,080 --> 03:21:46,140
You're in Platinum right now?

6945
03:21:46,380 --> 03:21:46,820
Yeah.

6946
03:21:47,020 --> 03:21:47,480
Hey, see?

6947
03:21:47,500 --> 03:21:49,620
A full Platinum squad did better than Reptar.

6948
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:51,760
Yeah, a full Platinum squad did better than Reptar.

6949
03:21:53,420 --> 03:21:54,240
Ranked 0.5.

6950
03:21:54,400 --> 03:21:54,420
Ranked 0.5.

6951
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:55,320
We'll take that too.

6952
03:21:56,980 --> 03:21:57,460
That is our win.

6953
03:21:57,640 --> 03:21:59,000
That is our win today.

6954
03:21:59,380 --> 03:21:59,680
Oh, I know.

6955
03:21:59,740 --> 03:22:01,680
That is the only thing I'm taking home with pride today.

6956
03:22:02,860 --> 03:22:04,040
Better than Reptar.

6957
03:22:04,540 --> 03:22:04,940
Better than Reptar.

6958
03:22:04,940 --> 03:22:07,020
I know Greek needs a shot of alcohol.

6959
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:08,160
It's so bad right now.

6960
03:22:09,660 --> 03:22:11,960
The fact that Greek lost to us.

6961
03:22:12,720 --> 03:22:13,080
The fact that Greek lost to us.

6962
03:22:13,080 --> 03:22:15,960
And just also, if he's getting 20th, then he didn't have a vibe squad like us.

6963
03:22:16,020 --> 03:22:16,320
Oh boy.

6964
03:22:16,460 --> 03:22:17,660
Oh boy, yeah, yeah.

6965
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:20,020
He didn't get to have the fun part.

6966
03:22:20,100 --> 03:22:22,280
He didn't take a trident into a full team.

6967
03:22:22,740 --> 03:22:23,000
He didn't take a trident into a full team.

6968
03:22:23,540 --> 03:22:24,120
Wait, dude.

6969
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:24,980
Come on, man.

6970
03:22:24,980 --> 03:22:27,300
You had no idea there was a team there.

6971
03:22:28,460 --> 03:22:29,980
You had no idea there was a team there.

6972
03:22:29,980 --> 03:22:32,280
It happened so fast.

6973
03:22:32,420 --> 03:22:32,480
It happened so fast.

6974
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:33,740
I didn't even know what happened.

6975
03:22:34,020 --> 03:22:35,580
I knew things were going to be bad.

6976
03:22:35,960 --> 03:22:42,440
The thing you said was I'm going to do something that might not be a good idea, but it would be really funny.

6977
03:22:43,040 --> 03:22:44,000
That's what you said.

6978
03:22:45,280 --> 03:22:48,520
I mean, I sent you alone to 1v3 fist fight inside of Fight Night.

6979
03:22:48,620 --> 03:22:48,680
I mean, I sent you alone to 1v3 fist fight inside of Fight Night.

6980
03:22:48,680 --> 03:22:49,100
That's pretty funny.

6981
03:22:50,260 --> 03:22:53,860
You were getting your ass beat inside of Fight Night 1v3.

6982
03:22:58,320 --> 03:23:02,180
At least we got the content out of the way.

6983
03:23:04,880 --> 03:23:06,280
We got real content.

6984
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:07,460
We had real content.

6985
03:23:07,520 --> 03:23:09,200
No other team had as much fun as us.

6986
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:10,760
Who is this winning right now?

6987
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:11,960
I don't know.

6988
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:13,000
This team winning might have a good time.

6989
03:23:15,640 --> 03:23:16,800
They just wasted all their grenades.

6990
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:18,920
They're not even pushing over yet.

6991
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:19,680
Why did they just waste all their grenades?

6992
03:23:19,700 --> 03:23:20,700
Oh yeah, this is the watch party.

6993
03:23:20,880 --> 03:23:21,960
This is your watch party time.

6994
03:23:22,520 --> 03:23:22,880
Exactly.

6995
03:23:23,860 --> 03:23:25,960
Wig wanted to die early so he could watch party.

6996
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:26,760
In game watch party.

6997
03:23:26,760 --> 03:23:27,300
Here you go, Chad.

6998
03:23:27,380 --> 03:23:27,640
Look at that.

6999
03:23:27,740 --> 03:23:28,700
And the win is going to go.

7000
03:23:29,080 --> 03:23:29,460
Nice.

7001
03:23:30,100 --> 03:23:30,400
Wow.

7002
03:23:30,460 --> 03:23:31,200
Look at that endgame.

7003
03:23:31,720 --> 03:23:32,100
Wow.

7004
03:23:32,440 --> 03:23:33,260
Oh my god.

7005
03:23:33,280 --> 03:23:33,640
He won.

7006
03:23:36,880 --> 03:23:38,000
That might be Gen.

7007
03:23:39,380 --> 03:23:39,900
Gen Burn.

7008
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:40,560
I think.

7009
03:23:41,800 --> 03:23:42,360
Oh, Gen.

7010
03:23:42,400 --> 03:23:42,940
Yeah, Gen 1.

7011
03:23:43,240 --> 03:23:44,820
Wait, do you actually memorize the skins?

7012
03:23:45,700 --> 03:23:48,380
Wasn't he like first place by like 30 points going into the game?

7013
03:23:48,400 --> 03:23:48,600
Yeah.

7014
03:23:49,240 --> 03:23:51,220
So did he just win by like 50 points?

7015
03:23:51,220 --> 03:23:52,480
Yeah, he lost by like 100 points.

7016
03:23:52,920 --> 03:23:53,880
Holy shit.

7017
03:23:53,920 --> 03:23:54,820
With girl too?

7018
03:23:54,960 --> 03:23:56,060
Girl's going crazy.

7019
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:58,720
That was not us, guys.

7020
03:23:58,920 --> 03:23:59,920
I wonder what that's like.

7021
03:24:00,440 --> 03:24:01,860
I don't think we'll ever feel that.

7022
03:24:02,400 --> 03:24:03,140
No, we will.

7023
03:24:03,160 --> 03:24:03,980
It's challenger circuit.

7024
03:24:05,660 --> 03:24:08,020
I don't think we'll ever know what that feels like.

7025
03:24:08,080 --> 03:24:09,460
I don't think we'll ever know what that feels like.

7026
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:11,360
We got fucking wrenched.

7027
03:24:12,800 --> 03:24:13,840
Guys, don't worry.

7028
03:24:14,060 --> 03:24:15,580
Look at where team 14 is.

7029
03:24:16,300 --> 03:24:16,780
Guys, don't worry.

7030
03:24:16,780 --> 03:24:17,240
Look at where team 14 is.

7031
03:24:17,240 --> 03:24:17,260
Good.

7032
03:24:17,380 --> 03:24:17,980
We're safe.

7033
03:24:17,980 --> 03:24:20,960
It would have been worrying if they got some kills.

7034
03:24:21,120 --> 03:24:21,260
Yeah, yeah.

7035
03:24:21,420 --> 03:24:22,000
Don't worry.

7036
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:22,840
We had zero kills.

7037
03:24:22,920 --> 03:24:25,260
Wait, how does team 20 have three kills?

7038
03:24:25,440 --> 03:24:26,660
And they died in 20th.

7039
03:24:26,840 --> 03:24:27,540
I don't know.

7040
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:30,080
Wait, what?

7041
03:24:30,340 --> 03:24:30,700
Yeah.

7042
03:24:31,320 --> 03:24:32,420
Maybe they rez.

7043
03:24:32,560 --> 03:24:33,140
Maybe they rez.

7044
03:24:33,760 --> 03:24:36,000
They could have got picks and then the people rez.

7045
03:24:36,440 --> 03:24:36,880
Maybe.

7046
03:24:37,640 --> 03:24:38,660
We did it, guys.

7047
03:24:39,640 --> 03:24:40,080
Guys.

7048
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:41,360
Dude, what did we fucking get, man?

7049
03:24:41,400 --> 03:24:42,140
We had to get last.

7050
03:24:42,540 --> 03:24:46,960
No, we're second last because Green's team never got a single point.

7051
03:24:47,140 --> 03:24:47,820
Is that going to burn?

7052
03:24:47,980 --> 03:24:50,280
Oh, everyone gets the same amount.

7053
03:24:50,820 --> 03:24:52,060
Yeah, everyone gets 400.

7054
03:24:52,500 --> 03:24:54,700
11th to 20th all get the same amount.

7055
03:24:55,380 --> 03:24:55,860
Okay.

7056
03:24:56,220 --> 03:24:57,300
Yeah, so we're fine.

7057
03:24:57,440 --> 03:24:58,700
It doesn't matter what place we're at.

7058
03:24:58,960 --> 03:24:59,040
Technically, we're 11.

7059
03:24:59,400 --> 03:25:00,460
Okay, makes sense.

7060
03:25:00,660 --> 03:25:02,080
Yeah, everybody's 11th place.

7061
03:25:02,580 --> 03:25:03,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7062
03:25:03,620 --> 03:25:06,660
Everybody is 11th place.

7063
03:25:06,780 --> 03:25:10,680
So, technically, we're all 11th place.

7064
03:25:10,860 --> 03:25:12,400
Except for Green, who's 12th.

7065
03:25:13,440 --> 03:25:13,920
What?

7066
03:25:13,980 --> 03:25:16,320
Apparently, the team above us in docks was Greek.

7067
03:25:16,820 --> 03:25:17,300
What?

7068
03:25:18,880 --> 03:25:19,780
Wait, really?

7069
03:25:20,480 --> 03:25:21,420
I'm asking.

7070
03:25:21,540 --> 03:25:25,140
They were probably so confused why we took the Trident and left.

7071
03:25:25,260 --> 03:25:26,940
They were probably so dumbfounded.

7072
03:25:27,620 --> 03:25:28,860
That is unbelievable.

7073
03:25:29,020 --> 03:25:30,240
There's no fucking way.

7074
03:25:32,180 --> 03:25:33,640
They're taking the fucking Trident?

7075
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:36,320
That is so fucking funny.

7076
03:25:36,320 --> 03:25:36,720
Look at us.

7077
03:25:37,140 --> 03:25:38,900
Look at us go.

7078
03:25:39,740 --> 03:25:41,160
I told you guys.

7079
03:25:41,300 --> 03:25:42,420
I told you guys.

7080
03:25:43,280 --> 03:25:46,020
I bet you no one had as much fun as us.

7081
03:25:46,300 --> 03:25:46,820
Chad.

7082
03:25:46,820 --> 03:25:50,540
This was very good practice for Challenger Circuit.

7083
03:25:50,980 --> 03:25:51,420
Agreed.

7084
03:25:52,120 --> 03:25:55,540
Okay, so what did we learn today that we're going to take it to Challenger Circuit?

7085
03:25:56,600 --> 03:25:57,480
I think...

7086
03:25:57,480 --> 03:25:59,720
Never get beacons, so don't bother with the controller character.

7087
03:26:00,260 --> 03:26:01,400
That's not what we learned.

7088
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,400
Thank God you understand what we learned today.

7089
03:26:05,500 --> 03:26:07,060
Thank God we are talking about this now.

7090
03:26:07,620 --> 03:26:08,500
What do you mean?

7091
03:26:08,520 --> 03:26:09,860
That's exactly what we learned.

7092
03:26:10,080 --> 03:26:12,760
What we learned is that we need a POI with a scan.

7093
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:14,960
We need to figure out a POI.

7094
03:26:14,960 --> 03:26:23,120
And even if we're going to get contested, we still need to figure out a POI and not get bullied out of our POI.

7095
03:26:23,560 --> 03:26:24,560
Unlike today.

7096
03:26:24,680 --> 03:26:24,720
I agree.

7097
03:26:26,780 --> 03:26:29,180
And we need to figure out what to play.

7098
03:26:29,480 --> 03:26:32,900
Because apparently we might be playing this game for seven hours on Saturday.

7099
03:26:33,420 --> 03:26:33,920
Yep.

7100
03:26:34,520 --> 03:26:35,740
Seven hours of that.

7101
03:26:35,880 --> 03:26:36,900
We need to do better than that.

7102
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:37,480
Yeah.

7103
03:26:38,520 --> 03:26:42,020
And it's going to be next week for sure.

7104
03:26:43,400 --> 03:26:43,900
Right?

7105
03:26:45,080 --> 03:26:47,940
Is it actually next week or did I just guess like you two think it's next week?

7106
03:26:47,940 --> 03:26:47,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7107
03:26:47,980 --> 03:26:48,780
No, it's next week.

7108
03:26:48,780 --> 03:26:49,320
Okay, okay.

7109
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:50,280
It's actually next week.

7110
03:26:50,300 --> 03:26:50,580
Okay.

7111
03:26:56,660 --> 03:26:57,940
Oh my God, bro.

7112
03:26:58,120 --> 03:27:00,140
Your fucking chat, Wig.

7113
03:27:00,440 --> 03:27:03,160
I can see why Tempo is the manager.

7114
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:04,640
Who said that?

7115
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:07,000
Holy shit.

7116
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:07,800
Wait a minute.

7117
03:27:07,960 --> 03:27:09,020
I have mod...

7118
03:27:09,020 --> 03:27:09,380
Oh, no, wait.

7119
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:09,760
No, I know.

7120
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:11,920
Alright.

7121
03:27:11,960 --> 03:27:12,240
Oh, yeah.

7122
03:27:12,700 --> 03:27:13,020
100%.

7123
03:27:13,020 --> 03:27:13,500
Oh, my chat.

7124
03:27:13,520 --> 03:27:14,400
My chat's crazy right now.

7125
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:14,520
Yeah.

7126
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:18,780
Yeah, I got shit on more today than I ever have in my life to be honest.

7127
03:27:18,900 --> 03:27:21,660
Wait, are you going to be interviewed because you're headlining this?

7128
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:22,720
Hell no.

7129
03:27:22,780 --> 03:27:23,240
I was already interviewed.

7130
03:27:23,340 --> 03:27:24,120
Girls are going to get interviewed now.

7131
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:24,660
What the fuck?

7132
03:27:24,760 --> 03:27:25,780
Are you going to be interviewed?

7133
03:27:26,040 --> 03:27:29,900
We should be having an interview for like the vibes.

7134
03:27:31,740 --> 03:27:32,280
We should be having an interview for like the vibes.

7135
03:27:33,500 --> 03:27:35,440
I can't believe... I can't believe we didn't get...

7136
03:27:35,440 --> 03:27:36,820
I can't believe you didn't bring us to the interview.

7137
03:27:37,480 --> 03:27:38,560
I can't believe...

7138
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:41,080
Yeah, they should get you on there.

7139
03:27:41,300 --> 03:27:42,060
No, they should have got all of us.

7140
03:27:42,060 --> 03:27:42,540
All of us.

7141
03:27:44,100 --> 03:27:47,180
Well, Nicewith told me three times to take a trident when I shouldn't have.

7142
03:27:47,740 --> 03:27:51,300
And, you know, he denied me all correctly one time.

7143
03:27:51,440 --> 03:27:52,620
But, you know, we had a good time today.

7144
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:53,480
Yeah, we...

7145
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:54,580
Yeah.

7146
03:27:54,940 --> 03:27:56,320
He said like this was...

7147
03:27:56,320 --> 03:28:00,060
The last thing I heard was this might be a really bad idea, but it's going to be funny.

7148
03:28:00,500 --> 03:28:01,920
This might be a really bad idea, but it's going to be funny.

7149
03:28:02,680 --> 03:28:02,840
Yeah.

7150
03:28:03,540 --> 03:28:06,620
He said this is going to be funny and then none of us laughed afterwards.

7151
03:28:06,980 --> 03:28:07,280
He said this is going to be funny and then none of us laughed afterwards.

7152
03:28:07,280 --> 03:28:08,640
Yeah, and then we got Ark started.

7153
03:28:09,260 --> 03:28:10,180
I got confused.

7154
03:28:10,180 --> 03:28:11,060
I got confused.

7155
03:28:12,060 --> 03:28:14,620
I got so confused, I didn't know what was going on.

7156
03:28:14,840 --> 03:28:16,480
All I know is I got stunned.

7157
03:28:16,920 --> 03:28:18,340
And then there was people.

7158
03:28:18,560 --> 03:28:23,500
Tempo had a bladder issue too, so like honestly we should negate everything that happened.

7159
03:28:24,620 --> 03:28:25,140
Yeah.

7160
03:28:25,840 --> 03:28:28,100
We should just reset the scores.

7161
03:28:28,480 --> 03:28:29,720
Oh my god.

7162
03:28:30,180 --> 03:28:33,160
Reset and then multiply game one by six.

7163
03:28:34,060 --> 03:28:34,580
Reset and then multiply game one by six.

7164
03:28:34,580 --> 03:28:37,120
I don't think game one was the game that we did the best in.

7165
03:28:37,180 --> 03:28:38,220
It was like game four.

7166
03:28:38,760 --> 03:28:39,820
Yeah, we know.

7167
03:28:39,920 --> 03:28:40,760
We got like...

7168
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:44,760
They won three games out of six.

7169
03:28:44,980 --> 03:28:45,620
Jen's team?

7170
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:48,720
Yeah, that's fucking crazy.

7171
03:28:49,140 --> 03:28:49,540
Bro.

7172
03:28:50,120 --> 03:28:51,280
That could have been me.

7173
03:28:53,320 --> 03:28:54,120
If I was...

7174
03:28:54,120 --> 03:28:54,860
If Jen picked me.

7175
03:28:56,720 --> 03:28:58,280
You guys really got lost every game.

7176
03:28:59,780 --> 03:29:02,160
If Jen got you, he loses six out of six.

7177
03:29:02,360 --> 03:29:03,360
There's no way.

7178
03:29:03,420 --> 03:29:05,900
We should have like a control group here.

7179
03:29:06,780 --> 03:29:10,100
Every tournament, Jen will pick one of us and then see who plays us higher.

7180
03:29:10,620 --> 03:29:11,020
Every tournament, Jen will pick one of us and then see who plays us higher.

7181
03:29:11,020 --> 03:29:11,740
It's not going to be me.

7182
03:29:12,060 --> 03:29:12,140
Oh my god.

7183
03:29:14,160 --> 03:29:15,760
You're playing higher than me sadly.

7184
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:20,840
We got to experiment here and see who's right.

7185
03:29:21,580 --> 03:29:23,220
That was so fucking fun, man.

7186
03:29:23,320 --> 03:29:24,080
Thank you guys so much.

7187
03:29:24,120 --> 03:29:25,160
I appreciate y'all for playing too.

7188
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:25,880
Seriously guys.

7189
03:29:25,960 --> 03:29:26,600
That was really fun.

7190
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:32,520
Maybe just fucking play some games soon or something like that if you guys want to.

7191
03:29:33,320 --> 03:29:34,300
Actually like ranked or anything.

7192
03:29:34,320 --> 03:29:36,120
We should really practice.

7193
03:29:36,700 --> 03:29:37,860
We should probably play a bit.

7194
03:29:38,060 --> 03:29:39,160
You guys want to practice this week?

7195
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:39,580
I'm down?

7196
03:29:39,640 --> 03:29:40,040
Yeah.

7197
03:29:40,440 --> 03:29:41,000
Okay.

7198
03:29:43,740 --> 03:29:46,620
Should it be next week since CC is next week?

7199
03:29:46,960 --> 03:29:48,100
Oh yeah.

7200
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:48,500
That's what I meant.

7201
03:29:48,580 --> 03:29:48,900
Like Monday.

7202
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:49,240
My bad.

7203
03:29:50,120 --> 03:29:50,680
Wait.

7204
03:29:51,280 --> 03:29:51,860
Is it today Monday?

7205
03:29:53,220 --> 03:29:54,900
Today is Friday.

7206
03:29:55,420 --> 03:29:56,460
Today is Friday.

7207
03:29:57,920 --> 03:29:58,720
Is what?

7208
03:29:59,340 --> 03:29:59,900
What?

7209
03:30:00,040 --> 03:30:00,560
Nothing.

7210
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:01,600
Temple.

7211
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:03,000
Yeah.

7212
03:30:03,040 --> 03:30:03,480
It's Friday.

7213
03:30:04,880 --> 03:30:05,440
Wait.

7214
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:05,960
What's...

7215
03:30:05,960 --> 03:30:06,140
Oh.

7216
03:30:07,240 --> 03:30:07,640
Wait.

7217
03:30:07,640 --> 03:30:09,060
Did you not think it was Friday?

7218
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:11,380
I forgot what day it was.

7219
03:30:12,840 --> 03:30:13,240
What?

7220
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:14,440
Temple.

7221
03:30:14,480 --> 03:30:19,300
How do you run shit so efficiently but just don't even know the day of the week?

7222
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:21,500
You're impressive, man.

7223
03:30:21,640 --> 03:30:23,060
I actually love you so much.

7224
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:25,260
You're like the most functional, unfunctional person I've ever met in my life.

7225
03:30:25,280 --> 03:30:25,840
Oh yeah.

7226
03:30:25,880 --> 03:30:26,860
Have you seen like...

7227
03:30:26,860 --> 03:30:28,960
Have you seen like all the...

7228
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:31,040
Like all of his PC setup?

7229
03:30:31,320 --> 03:30:34,140
He has like five monitors or some shit.

7230
03:30:34,520 --> 03:30:34,920
Yeah.

7231
03:30:34,920 --> 03:30:35,360
It's like he's like...

7232
03:30:35,960 --> 03:30:38,820
And then Doki plastered all of her merch all over my screens.

7233
03:30:38,820 --> 03:30:38,820
Okay.

7234
03:30:38,900 --> 03:30:39,360
Not me.

7235
03:30:39,380 --> 03:30:40,460
It was like one of my...

7236
03:30:40,460 --> 03:30:42,620
One of my patents.

7237
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:44,360
She's like, there you go.

7238
03:30:44,360 --> 03:30:46,760
You should buy all of this Doki merch.

7239
03:30:47,020 --> 03:30:48,120
Buy Doki merch.

7240
03:30:48,180 --> 03:30:49,800
His walls are so barren.

7241
03:30:49,800 --> 03:30:51,020
Have you seen his walls?

7242
03:30:51,640 --> 03:30:52,420
Also, wait.

7243
03:30:52,440 --> 03:30:55,840
You promised me you would buy like a Doki print and put it on your backdrop.

7244
03:30:56,260 --> 03:30:56,720
Also, wait.

7245
03:30:56,720 --> 03:30:56,720
You promised me you would buy like a Doki print and put it on your backdrop.

7246
03:30:56,720 --> 03:30:58,740
I promised you I'd buy it and then burn it.

7247
03:30:59,060 --> 03:31:00,700
I promised I'd buy it.

7248
03:31:00,700 --> 03:31:01,320
You said you would put it behind you.

7249
03:31:02,140 --> 03:31:04,800
I'll get it behind you and I'll put it behind me and I'll burn it.

7250
03:31:04,820 --> 03:31:05,040
Alright.

7251
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:05,500
Do it.

7252
03:31:05,540 --> 03:31:05,940
Do it.

7253
03:31:05,960 --> 03:31:06,200
Alright.

7254
03:31:06,300 --> 03:31:06,440
Deal.

7255
03:31:06,520 --> 03:31:06,780
Deal.

7256
03:31:06,860 --> 03:31:07,200
Do it.

7257
03:31:07,260 --> 03:31:08,140
It's just your money.

7258
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:10,280
Yeah.

7259
03:31:10,340 --> 03:31:11,060
It's just my money.

7260
03:31:12,740 --> 03:31:14,140
It's just a picture of you.

7261
03:31:14,400 --> 03:31:15,660
It's literally your money.

7262
03:31:15,940 --> 03:31:16,840
Oh yeah.

7263
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:17,840
Speaking of...

7264
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:18,540
Subs.

7265
03:31:18,900 --> 03:31:20,040
Oh my god.

7266
03:31:20,140 --> 03:31:21,140
How many do you deserve, Tempo?

7267
03:31:21,160 --> 03:31:22,080
What does the sub count actually?

7268
03:31:22,240 --> 03:31:22,620
Tempo got like...

7269
03:31:22,620 --> 03:31:24,780
Tempo got four kills.

7270
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:26,280
Oh my god.

7271
03:31:26,380 --> 03:31:26,680
Did you?

7272
03:31:26,720 --> 03:31:27,420
That's 40 subs.

7273
03:31:27,840 --> 03:31:30,220
I thought you got five subs per kill.

7274
03:31:30,280 --> 03:31:30,360
No?

7275
03:31:30,680 --> 03:31:31,260
Oh yeah.

7276
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:32,580
So 20 subs.

7277
03:31:32,840 --> 03:31:33,720
20 subs.

7278
03:31:36,620 --> 03:31:37,640
You said 20 subs for me and Tempo.

7279
03:31:37,640 --> 03:31:41,840
And then 20... No you said 20 subs for me and Tempo.

7280
03:31:41,840 --> 03:31:43,320
You just keep bumping up the number.

7281
03:31:43,500 --> 03:31:43,600
Yeah.

7282
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:43,640
Yeah.

7283
03:31:43,680 --> 03:31:43,740
Yeah.

7284
03:31:43,740 --> 03:31:44,180
I'll do it.

7285
03:31:44,320 --> 03:31:44,680
Wait.

7286
03:31:45,880 --> 03:31:47,240
I can't gift Tempo subs.

7287
03:31:48,120 --> 03:31:48,480
Wait.

7288
03:31:48,520 --> 03:31:48,700
What?

7289
03:31:48,760 --> 03:31:50,320
Are you not even an affiliate, Tempo?

7290
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:50,740
Oh no.

7291
03:31:50,780 --> 03:31:51,080
I can't.

7292
03:31:51,100 --> 03:31:51,280
I can't.

7293
03:31:51,320 --> 03:31:52,740
Oh it's gonna be like...

7294
03:31:52,740 --> 03:31:53,400
Alright.

7295
03:31:53,500 --> 03:31:54,660
20 gifted to Tempo.

7296
03:31:56,880 --> 03:31:57,240
Wait.

7297
03:31:57,280 --> 03:31:58,640
Gift one sub and I'm gonna give 20.

7298
03:31:58,940 --> 03:32:00,940
20 subs is $100?

7299
03:32:01,660 --> 03:32:01,900
Yay!

7300
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:03,120
You got five kills?

7301
03:32:03,320 --> 03:32:03,620
Yeah.

7302
03:32:03,900 --> 03:32:04,900
You got five.

7303
03:32:05,180 --> 03:32:05,820
You got five.

7304
03:32:05,820 --> 03:32:07,480
We have five kills.

7305
03:32:07,700 --> 03:32:08,040
Oh.

7306
03:32:08,340 --> 03:32:09,020
Tempo says 25.

7307
03:32:09,340 --> 03:32:12,000
I don't know who's kills these are.

7308
03:32:12,200 --> 03:32:13,420
I have an interview with the winners.

7309
03:32:13,540 --> 03:32:14,400
I have no idea what's going on.

7310
03:32:14,400 --> 03:32:14,440
Wait.

7311
03:32:14,440 --> 03:32:15,000
Can we join?

7312
03:32:16,120 --> 03:32:16,980
I'll ask them.

7313
03:32:18,100 --> 03:32:18,440
Okay.

7314
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:18,920
Watch out.

7315
03:32:18,960 --> 03:32:19,720
I'll ask them too.

7316
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:21,160
I'll try to get you guys in there.

7317
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:23,660
We'll just be like, hey we're gonna be here to help.

7318
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:25,400
I'll see.

7319
03:32:25,580 --> 03:32:25,760
I'll see.

7320
03:32:25,800 --> 03:32:26,120
One sec.

7321
03:32:26,240 --> 03:32:26,520
I'll try.

7322
03:32:28,280 --> 03:32:30,360
We just fucking crashed the interview.

7323
03:32:31,720 --> 03:32:32,060
Yeah.

7324
03:32:35,220 --> 03:32:37,240
By the way, Tempo, I made up that number.

7325
03:32:37,340 --> 03:32:38,840
I don't even know how many kills you got.

7326
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:39,140
Yeah.

7327
03:32:39,220 --> 03:32:40,820
I don't know how many kills we got.

7328
03:32:41,020 --> 03:32:43,040
I see total kills as five.

7329
03:32:43,260 --> 03:32:44,340
I see total kills as five.

7330
03:32:44,340 --> 03:32:44,900
So four.

7331
03:32:45,160 --> 03:32:46,720
We'll stay with five.

7332
03:32:46,740 --> 03:32:47,720
We'll stay with five.

7333
03:32:47,820 --> 03:32:49,240
It says total kills.

7334
03:32:49,580 --> 03:32:50,100
He doesn't know.

7335
03:32:50,480 --> 03:32:50,920
He's not gonna fact check.

7336
03:32:50,920 --> 03:32:51,160
He doesn't know.

7337
03:32:51,240 --> 03:32:52,140
He's not gonna fact check.

7338
03:32:54,920 --> 03:32:55,360
Yeah.

7339
03:32:55,960 --> 03:32:56,400
Yeah.

7340
03:32:59,820 --> 03:33:01,460
So five kills, right?

7341
03:33:01,600 --> 03:33:02,040
Yeah.

7342
03:33:02,060 --> 03:33:04,220
That's 25 subs for you.

7343
03:33:04,820 --> 03:33:05,300
That's 25 subs for you.

7344
03:33:05,500 --> 03:33:06,400
It's payday.

7345
03:33:07,640 --> 03:33:08,120
Okay.

7346
03:33:08,120 --> 03:33:08,440
We're back.

7347
03:33:08,720 --> 03:33:09,920
What is Wig gonna do?

7348
03:33:09,960 --> 03:33:10,840
Review the VOD?

7349
03:33:11,060 --> 03:33:11,540
Exactly.

7350
03:33:14,920 --> 03:33:17,000
She's not gonna review the VOD.

7351
03:33:18,320 --> 03:33:20,680
Guys, I don't think Wig's gonna...

7352
03:33:20,680 --> 03:33:23,100
I don't think he's coming back.

7353
03:33:23,540 --> 03:33:25,740
I think he's gonna come back, but the interview's gonna be over.

7354
03:33:26,140 --> 03:33:28,360
He didn't bring us back to the room.

7355
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:30,200
I can't believe it.

7356
03:33:32,060 --> 03:33:35,120
I can't believe he didn't bring us into the interview room.

7357
03:33:35,260 --> 03:33:36,040
He left us.

7358
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:37,160
That's so fucked up.

7359
03:33:37,340 --> 03:33:38,520
He's about to...

7360
03:33:39,140 --> 03:33:40,360
He's about to interview now.

7361
03:33:40,640 --> 03:33:41,660
That's fucked up.

7362
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:43,140
He didn't even tell us.

7363
03:33:43,300 --> 03:33:46,100
He didn't drag us in.

7364
03:33:46,180 --> 03:33:47,720
He didn't drag us in.

7365
03:33:48,280 --> 03:33:49,320
Oh my god.

7366
03:33:50,880 --> 03:33:55,220
He actually just went peace and left us.

7367
03:33:58,870 --> 03:34:00,630
I'm gonna message him.

7368
03:34:00,730 --> 03:34:01,930
Shake my head.

7369
03:34:02,090 --> 03:34:03,670
Actually left us.

7370
03:34:08,030 --> 03:34:08,430
Shake my head.

7371
03:34:08,990 --> 03:34:10,190
Shake my head.

7372
03:34:13,510 --> 03:34:14,790
Can't believe it.

7373
03:34:17,090 --> 03:34:18,550
He left for milk.

7374
03:34:22,820 --> 03:34:24,620
He actually left us.

7375
03:34:26,980 --> 03:34:32,860
We're like the only one... oh wait no, actually I was gonna say I thought we were like the only one in VC, but we can only see our own VCs.

7376
03:34:36,990 --> 03:34:37,390
Yeah.

7377
03:34:37,530 --> 03:34:38,650
And then the one above us.

7378
03:34:38,870 --> 03:34:42,190
We can click into the... oh no wait nevermind.

7379
03:34:42,430 --> 03:34:43,630
We can't click.

7380
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:50,240
We just like... Guys we doubled...

7381
03:34:50,240 --> 03:34:52,480
We doubled Greek's score.

7382
03:34:52,760 --> 03:34:54,420
Did we double Greek's score?

7383
03:34:54,620 --> 03:34:56,540
Guys we doubled Greek's score.

7384
03:34:56,760 --> 03:34:57,780
We doubled his score.

7385
03:35:00,480 --> 03:35:02,100
Guys we did it!

7386
03:35:02,580 --> 03:35:06,520
We're better than the Rank 1 Pred last season.

7387
03:35:06,780 --> 03:35:08,020
Just remember that.

7388
03:35:08,380 --> 03:35:12,100
Any team... we're better than the team that was...

7389
03:35:12,100 --> 03:35:13,940
That had a Rank 1 Pred.

7390
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:19,780
That's all it takes.

7391
03:35:21,060 --> 03:35:22,320
Oh my god.

7392
03:35:22,960 --> 03:35:24,140
Look last look!

7393
03:35:24,300 --> 03:35:26,540
It's cuz the current season doesn't have Rank 1 yet!

7394
03:35:26,600 --> 03:35:28,920
We don't know who's the current Rank 1 Pred yet this season.

7395
03:35:29,480 --> 03:35:30,480
We don't know.

7396
03:35:32,740 --> 03:35:33,720
We don't know!

7397
03:35:33,840 --> 03:35:35,420
So it doesn't matter, chat.

7398
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:38,280
Yeah cuz it hasn't ended It didn't do it yet.

7399
03:35:38,540 --> 03:35:41,600
We're the strongest plat.

7400
03:35:41,660 --> 03:35:42,260
No, it didn't.

7401
03:35:42,260 --> 03:35:42,620
What do you mean?

7402
03:35:42,720 --> 03:35:43,420
The season is still ongoing.

7403
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:45,420
Is ranked season still ongoing?

7404
03:35:45,800 --> 03:35:46,920
Oh right, it ends next week.

7405
03:35:47,020 --> 03:35:48,440
Yeah, it's still ongoing.

7406
03:35:48,900 --> 03:35:50,000
So we're good.

7407
03:35:50,180 --> 03:35:50,740
We're good.

7408
03:35:51,180 --> 03:35:52,340
We're good to go.

7409
03:35:58,440 --> 03:36:01,000
I think we did pretty well.

7410
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:03,960
I think we did pretty well as a team.

7411
03:36:04,160 --> 03:36:06,620
I had zero expectations.

7412
03:36:07,260 --> 03:36:10,120
I still have zero expectations, but...

7413
03:36:11,500 --> 03:36:14,480
I thought we were going to get in the middle.

7414
03:36:14,740 --> 03:36:16,960
I know it wasn't going to happen.

7415
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:17,540
I know.

7416
03:36:19,420 --> 03:36:22,200
With our POIs, there was no way.

7417
03:36:22,380 --> 03:36:24,780
Literally, we had zero good POIs.

7418
03:36:25,800 --> 03:36:28,700
Wig literally got kicked out of all the good POIs.

7419
03:36:28,940 --> 03:36:34,020
The last Twitch Rivals we did, Wig actually had decent places to land.

7420
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:36,000
We actually had loot.

7421
03:36:36,020 --> 03:36:37,580
Let's see if they... that's true.

7422
03:36:37,780 --> 03:36:38,920
Yeah, we were what?

7423
03:36:39,020 --> 03:36:39,460
Grow towers?

7424
03:36:39,460 --> 03:36:40,760
We had loot.

7425
03:36:40,880 --> 03:36:43,720
Yeah, we had actual loot and we weren't getting contested.

7426
03:36:44,040 --> 03:36:48,020
This time, we got contested every time.

7427
03:36:48,160 --> 03:36:48,920
Or not every time.

7428
03:36:48,980 --> 03:36:51,160
We got kicked out of our areas.

7429
03:36:52,200 --> 03:36:52,980
Where's POI?

7430
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:57,020
It's like... I forgot what was the abbreviation for POI?

7431
03:36:58,500 --> 03:36:59,740
It's like the landmarks.

7432
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:00,440
So where you're landing.

7433
03:37:00,680 --> 03:37:02,360
I don't know what the abbreviation is.

7434
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:02,760
I forgot.

7435
03:37:03,240 --> 03:37:03,680
POI?

7436
03:37:03,900 --> 03:37:05,100
Oh, POI.

7437
03:37:05,100 --> 03:37:05,680
Point of interest.

7438
03:37:05,780 --> 03:37:09,440
So it's basically where teams get to pick where you want to land the landmarks.

7439
03:37:09,460 --> 03:37:15,180
And then, um, Wig tried to pick good spots, but then every other team kicked us out.

7440
03:37:16,460 --> 03:37:19,080
Every team kicked us out of the spots.

7441
03:37:19,440 --> 03:37:26,700
So we got the spots that were considered absolutely trash loot with zero hope.

7442
03:37:27,260 --> 03:37:28,140
He's weak.

7443
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:29,260
He's a little bitch.

7444
03:37:37,170 --> 03:37:38,230
Oh my god.

7445
03:37:38,850 --> 03:37:41,130
I don't even know how long this interview is going to be.

7446
03:37:42,150 --> 03:37:43,650
How long is this interview?

7447
03:37:46,470 --> 03:37:47,510
It just started.

7448
03:37:47,850 --> 03:37:49,550
Wait, they just started the interview?

7449
03:37:50,270 --> 03:37:50,710
Yeah.

7450
03:37:51,270 --> 03:37:52,150
Oh no.

7451
03:37:52,310 --> 03:37:53,350
They a- oh my god.

7452
03:37:53,390 --> 03:37:54,630
They just started the interview.

7453
03:37:59,490 --> 03:38:00,470
Oh my god.

7454
03:38:01,550 --> 03:38:02,750
I can't believe it.

7455
03:38:02,770 --> 03:38:03,830
How long are we going to be waiting here?

7456
03:38:07,850 --> 03:38:09,530
Yeah, the interview just started now.

7457
03:38:10,290 --> 03:38:15,110
Okay, if this interview is going to take really, really, really long, I might peace out soon.

7458
03:38:22,200 --> 03:38:23,840
I think it takes like three minutes.

7459
03:38:23,860 --> 03:38:26,120
15 minutes?!

7460
03:38:26,120 --> 03:38:28,520
Alright, GG's Tempo.

7461
03:38:28,640 --> 03:38:30,880
Tell Wig that I couldn't wait 15 minutes.

7462
03:38:31,220 --> 03:38:32,900
I couldn't wait...

7463
03:38:38,900 --> 03:38:39,380
GG's...

7464
03:38:40,180 --> 03:38:41,500
I have zero patience.

7465
03:38:43,340 --> 03:38:44,640
Alright, GG's Tempo.

7466
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:45,600
You have to do your schedule, right?

7467
03:38:45,900 --> 03:38:46,880
Yeah, I have to do my schedule.

7468
03:38:46,960 --> 03:38:47,520
When did you want to play?

7469
03:38:47,860 --> 03:38:48,560
What do you mean?

7470
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:51,360
When did you want to play, Wig?

7471
03:38:51,360 --> 03:38:56,080
I mean, most likely I won't be streaming it because I also have another Apex tournament too, other than CC.

7472
03:38:56,400 --> 03:38:57,960
So I don't want to put too many Apex on.

7473
03:38:58,140 --> 03:39:00,920
I'll most likely just play off... like, you guys can stream, but I'll play off stream.

7474
03:39:01,400 --> 03:39:01,760
Okay.

7475
03:39:02,060 --> 03:39:03,280
Alright, GG's Tempo.

7476
03:39:03,280 --> 03:39:04,640
Wait, you mean the one tomorrow, right?

7477
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:05,200
What?

7478
03:39:05,360 --> 03:39:06,020
No, not that.

7479
03:39:06,080 --> 03:39:06,500
Next week.

7480
03:39:06,540 --> 03:39:09,180
I mean, next week I have a lot of... I have another... I have two...

7481
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:11,360
Another Apex tournament other than the CC one.

7482
03:39:12,220 --> 03:39:12,800
Oh, really?

7483
03:39:13,080 --> 03:39:13,380
Yeah.

7484
03:39:13,740 --> 03:39:16,020
It's not been announced yet, so I can't really say much about it.

7485
03:39:16,100 --> 03:39:16,520
Oh, okay.

7486
03:39:16,580 --> 03:39:16,780
Gotcha.

7487
03:39:16,960 --> 03:39:17,260
Yeah, yeah.

7488
03:39:18,900 --> 03:39:19,620
Alright, GG's.

7489
03:39:20,200 --> 03:39:20,560
Bye.

7490
03:39:20,560 --> 03:39:21,240
I'll see you.

7491
03:39:21,360 --> 03:39:21,920
Bye.

7492
03:39:21,980 --> 03:39:22,780
I'll see you tomorrow.

7493
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:23,400
Yeah, yeah.

7494
03:39:23,420 --> 03:39:24,220
I'll see you tomorrow at finals.

7495
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:25,580
Bye-bye.

7496
03:39:26,600 --> 03:39:27,000
Bye.

7497
03:39:28,540 --> 03:39:29,700
Alright, alright, guys.

7498
03:39:31,080 --> 03:39:36,140
I'm gonna call it here because, like, I actually... I cannot wait 15 minutes.

7499
03:39:37,120 --> 03:39:42,640
I don't want to watch... I don't want to watch an interview for 15 minutes, guys.

7500
03:39:42,840 --> 03:39:44,580
I don't want to watch it.

7501
03:39:44,760 --> 03:39:46,180
But I had a great time.

7502
03:39:46,440 --> 03:39:47,140
I had a great time.

7503
03:39:47,200 --> 03:39:48,660
I always love playing with Wig and Tempo.

7504
03:39:49,640 --> 03:39:50,820
We're just, like, fucking around.

7505
03:39:52,760 --> 03:39:55,980
I had very low expectations and it's not last.

7506
03:39:56,180 --> 03:39:57,040
I'm fine with that.

7507
03:39:57,280 --> 03:39:57,700
I'm fine.

7508
03:39:57,760 --> 03:39:59,120
We beat the Rank 1 Pred team.

7509
03:39:59,480 --> 03:40:00,620
That's fine with me.

7510
03:40:00,780 --> 03:40:02,060
I'm happy with that.

7511
03:40:04,720 --> 03:40:08,540
The fact that we weren't last is good enough for me.

7512
03:40:08,720 --> 03:40:09,940
It's good enough for me.

7513
03:40:10,600 --> 03:40:12,620
But it was honestly... it was really fun.

7514
03:40:13,860 --> 03:40:16,400
Yeah, it exceeded my very, very low expectations.

7515
03:40:18,540 --> 03:40:21,120
And I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

Posture check.

Get a move around to get that blood flowing.

7539
03:41:21,580 --> 03:41:24,480
