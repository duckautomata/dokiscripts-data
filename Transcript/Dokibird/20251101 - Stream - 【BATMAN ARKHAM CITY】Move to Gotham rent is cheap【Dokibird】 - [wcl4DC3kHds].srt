3
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,420
Oh, by the way, remember that fun fact I gave you guys last Batman stream?

4
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,420
I found the article.

5
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,100
I found...

6
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,720
For those who weren't at the beginning of my stream, I gave everyone a very fun fact about our beloved Adam West.

7
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,320
Adam West, when he used to do the Batman show.

8
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,920
And oh my God, let me read you this article that I found.

9
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,340
That was where I got my fun fact from.

10
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,400
Batman legend, Adam Wentz, once had sex with eight women in one night.

11
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,980
It was the swing 60s with free love.

12
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,980
The late Adam West, who played Batman from 98?

13
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,780
I was like, how do you even, at that point, like, how do you even pay attention?

14
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:28,860
not enough hands for that like he is we i'm just like how the fuck does that even work at that point yeah that's just impressive from the late adam musk who played a batman from 1966 to 1968 sometimes used his superpowers for bad the sun compiled quotes from bert ward who played sidekick robin that detailed their lash of this pre-tabloid era exploits.

15
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,760
Britt and I were like kids in the candy store.

16
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,080
It was a swing 60s with free love.

17
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,520
And women threw themselves at us.

18
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,700
Jesus Christ.

19
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,720
I had young female co-stars in my dress room at 745.

20
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,400
That's too early, bro.

21
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,740
745 in the morning.

22
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,180
Holy shit.

23
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,380
Sadly, the rubber suit presented its challenge because of the physical limitations of the costumes.

24
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,500
Bro, I was just like, oh my God.

25
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,220
His long-term time sidekick, Bert Ward, now 71, has backed up West's powers.

26
00:08:19,200 --> 00:09:51,820
When I entered Batman as a naive 20-year-old who had only dated a couple of girls, I met Adam West would immediately introduce me to the wildest sexual debauchery that you can imagine we often found that women were banging on our windows like while we were bedded down with other women we start we're talking about wild times in the dressing rooms on the set between the shots in the lunch wagon and then of course doing the personal appearances on the got wild the suit stays on batman and to be honest with you we became like sexual vampires bro the 60s were fucking wild bro like okay look at this this is what robin said look at what okay this quote is actually crazy warren confirmed the costumes had so to do with it if you look at our costumes if you look at our show you'll see that we always stood with our legs open our fist on hips and our bat bulges forward which had a profound effect on women now you guys some of you guys who have never seen the batman show from from the adam west era

27
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:03,020
Let me show you what he meant when he was like, yeah, back then, like our costumes, they had a profound effect on women.

28
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,000
So you must be wondering, wow, these costumes must have been so fucking good.

29
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,540
They must have been like, holy, the sexiest things I've ever seen.

30
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,800
These were the costumes, by the way.

31
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:34,410
These, these, These were the costumes that made these women swoon to the point where Adam had eight women at the same day.

32
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,810
Like, God, that's so sexy.

33
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,070
Good times.

34
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,410
Are you not attracted, dragons?

35
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,610
That would make any women crazy.

36
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,130
Women and men crazy.

37
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:09,530
chick magnets right there the vintage wrist oh yeah it's the first day of knowing that November 2 oh I'm sorry guys if this is what's gonna make you lose I'm sorry guys

38
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:29,760
so yeah um so I found yeah so if you guys want to uh you guys want to read the article to be fair I basically read the entire article to you guys I had to know Because I know some of you guys were like, we're fact checked.

39
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,820
And I was like, here's the fact.

40
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,440
Here's my sources in MLA format.

41
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,860
Here you go.

42
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,640

Thank you.

45
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,020
Adam West is simply the truest American hero.

46
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,100
Thank you for the super chat.

47
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,940
Thank you.

48
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,320
Thank you.

49
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,760
Source provided.

50
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,860
That's like crazy.

51
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,480
I was like, I would not expect that, you know, seeing this.

52
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,020
Seeing this and...

53
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,840
Guys, they were sexual vampires, guys.

54
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,480
Batman!

55
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,420
I'm such a dad.

56
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,140
I think it's just the costumes.

57
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,100
I think the costumes were just...

58
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,720
Did not appeal.

59
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,580
Like, was not very good with, like, making someone look good at it.

60
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,040
Like, it was just impossible to look good in that costume.

61
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,180
Because, like, look at this.

62
00:12:26,860 --> 00:13:28,650
between like Adam West in the costume and then Adam West in like I guess like half half naked I think I think like I think like the sexiest person alive can't make this work can like it's like he's like a different person I'm surprised the suit couldn't even like show any of the muscles at all it looks like he gained 30 pounds from just wearing the outfit um no i because i also have this tweet on hand too because i was like okay i gotta show this on stream too i gotta i gotta i gotta make sure you guys see this tweet as well which is where i got my fun fact from um originally yeah suit suit is definitely a debuff i think the suit is a But apparently in the 60s that I just,

63
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,170
I guess I didn't have taste in the 60s then.

64
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:52,030
I guess women were throwing themselves just from the costume alone, which is surprising because I'm just like, I'm just like, what, what, how bad could like other costumes be if this is what the women were throwing themselves into?

65
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,450
Or it could be the drugs.

66
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:53,990
That's true.

67
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,310
season.

68
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,730
That's true.

69
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,790
Um, if you cannot from the suit, then you don't deserve Bruce Wayne.

70
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,590
All right.

71
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,250
Anyway, that's my fun fact of the day.

72
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,770
Uh, all right.

73
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,230
Anyway, today we're gonna play Batman.

74
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:21,510
Um, also I've learned from just people because I was like, what the fuck does, you know, Wayne Industries do?

75
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,330
Apparently they're just a pharmaceutical company.

76
00:14:24,670 --> 00:15:26,630
Well, like their main business is being a pharmaceutical company because that's what like his dad did and obviously bruce inherited the company so like so like me putting people in the hospital is just making me richer so the rich is actually the rich their rich keeps getting richer like i'm at literally big pharma so me trying to not so i understand that why he doesn't want to kill because these criminals are literally his source of money so yeah i'm literally doing it and criminals I beat up the more I'm I'm making from Wayne Industries yeah it's like that's why the hospitals are always full it's all it's all about the bottom line he says it's trauma but I believe it's for like he can't be a millionaire if he oh my god 12% I you can tell that I've not been doing any of the bonus stuff he says it's because of trauma but We know the real reason,

77
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,210
guys.

78
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,970
We know.

79
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,550
He needs more, he needs more clients for Big Pharma.

80
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,030
Okay, line launcher.

81
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,370
Boop.

82
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,430
Wee.

83
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,470
I don't even remember how I remember how I died.

84
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,170
They had like, they had, they like stocked up on security somehow.

85
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,510
All right.

86
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,850
Oh my god, it's the fucking, it's the same Riddleway trophy I got last time.

87
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,150
I really didn't say the Riddleway trophy.

88
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,470
Yeah, each criminal and it's my own paycheck.

89
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,210
What the fuck?

90
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,590
Oh.

91
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,590
Okay, it was RT.

92
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,630
I don't know why I thought it was B.

93
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,790
You see the way penguins guys just ran.

94
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,670
Alright, we gotta deal with these guys.

95
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,050
I'll kill him first.

96
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,710
Okay, I don't think he sees me.

97
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,190
Yeah, he doesn't have the heat sensor, so we're fine.

98
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,250
Oh, shit, never mind.

99
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,210
Oh, shit!

100
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,950
Hey, wake up, man.

101
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,790
Come on, wake up.

102
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,490
Yeah, oh, shit.

103
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,490
Give me a sec.

104
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:52,950
Give me a sec.

105
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,830
I know what to do.

106
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,550
Watch this.

107
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,550
Snow.

108
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,030
Still!

109
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,990
That's fine.

110
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,270
I do this and then I fly up.

111
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,750
And then I go this way.

112
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,270
They won't know.

113
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,910
I knocked him out.

114
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,890
He has a short-term memory now.

115
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,250
He lost his short-term memory.

116
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,090
Watch this.

117
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,650
Still!

118
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,310
This way!

119
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,290
He went this way!

120
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,630
Okay.

121
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,270
Look at that.

122
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,790
I'm okay.

123
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,010
See?

124
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,310
He doesn't know.

125
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,630
Watch this.

126
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,150
Steal!

127
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,010

Yes, okay.

134
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,670
Like, if it was just a space station.

135
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,990
But he has a fucking bat cave.

136
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,030
Come on.

137
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,030
And then he has to play child support for seven fucking kids.

138
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,710
There's, okay, or maybe six.

139
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,470

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,770
There's Dick.

There's Barbara.

143
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,710
And then there's, like, there's like another female Robin recently.

144
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:34,770
I don't remember who she was, but I remember there was another female Robin somewhere in the comic universe, in the comic user universe, and then there's Tim.

145
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,170
Yeah, so there's like seven.

146
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,310
He has to pay child support for seven Robins.

147
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:48,070
Like, so it's like, not, like, where is he getting that money from?

148
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,570
He has to keep sending criminals to the hospital to keep funding his enterprise.

149
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,210
How do I get out of here?

150
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:27,950

151
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,110
You really think Gordon is funding her Oracle side job.

152
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,690
You really think that, guys.

153
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,110
She goes to, she has a, she's a college student.

154
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,290
You really think she can afford all that fucking tech?

155
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,430
You know, Batman is, you know, Bruce Wayne is secretly funding it, her little side hobby.

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,810
Oh yeah, with that boy, policeman salary?

157
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,020
You really think a policeman's salary can do all that for her

158
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,930

I'm going to forget it.

166
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,450
That's too many buttons.

167
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,990
Three buttons is way too many.

168
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,130
One or two, that's how I work it.

169
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,390
Anyway, let me tag this real quick.

170
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,390
Okay.

171
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,810
Where am I supposed to go?

172
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,550
Oh wait, this is the main area.

173
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:04,930
It's this way.

174
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,670
Yeah, three is just a little too much.

175
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,770
Is it here?

176
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,950
Oh my god, sorry, my ex sent me another voicemail.

177
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,910
God, he's so obsessed with me.

178
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,810
But I told him, I told him, if he gave me super aids, it was over.

179
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,590
I told him to get tested.

180
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,430
You have one missed call.

181
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,460
That's it?

182
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,000
You have one missed call.

183
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,280
Are you serious?

184
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,960
I'm not sure that you got my call.

185
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,920
Oh, my God, it really is.

186
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,240
It really is like an X trying to reach you right now.

187
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,360
You have one missed call.

188
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,920
Oh, my God.

189
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,860

190
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,700
How many times has he tried?

191
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,010
Holy shit, he's so clingy.

192
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,570
You have one missed call.

193
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:14,930

198
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,630
He finally ended.

199
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,970
Bro, he's...

200
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,670

201
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,670
Bro, he's so clingy, man.

202
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:34,330
I don't answer his call one time, and my phone has, like, has, like, 20 messages.

203
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,550
He missed what he...

204
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,690
It's his fault, guys.

205
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,550
He regretted it.

206
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,070
He didn't know how good he had it until it was gone.

207
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,240
Don't leave, bro.

208
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,000
Bro, he fucking poisoned the...

209
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,680
He poisoned, like, hospitals with his blood.

210
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,260
What the fuck do you mean?

211
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,820
Don't leave him on red.

212
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:09,980
Alright.

213
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,500
Oh, guys, that was a bad idea.

214
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,620
Bad idea.

215
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,200
Bad.

216
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,520
Guys, what I thought.

217
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,820
I didn't...

218
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,580
Look, I didn't realize there was an army.

219
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,660
How the fuck was I supposed to know that?

220
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,510
Okay.

221
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,110
Jesus Christ, there's so many.

222
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,710
Bro, this guy's been like, oh yeah, watch that!

223
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,470
Okay, I might have crashed the party.

224
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:45,890
Okay.

225
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,910
There's just too many.

226
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,590
I can't do combos right now.

227
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,550
There's way too many going on.

228
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,330
You don't understand.

229
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,830
There you go.

230
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,650
Oh my god, there's so many people here.

231
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,090
Oh my god.

232
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,450
This guy fucked over my combo.

233
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:06,890
Bam!

234
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,810
Yo.

235
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,810
My nuclear fist!

236
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,890
Fat Man don't kill!

237
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,150
But Fat Man will send you to life support.

238
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,710
Because you gotta pay those medical bills to keep yourself alive.

239
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,870
Your family's gotta keep you alive.

240
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,650
And life support is very expensive.

241
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,670
That's how I make...

242
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,270
Money and Wayne Enterprises.

243
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,610
24-7 care, that's right.

244
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,530
24-7 paycheck.

245
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,890
The real killer are those pills.

246
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,190
A fate worse than death.

247
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,160
Get out of here.

248
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,920
Nice.

249
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,580
Wait, RTA?

250
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,140
Oh, it's this.

251
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,920
Wee!

252
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,740
Alright, that was easy.

253
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,880
Where do I go?

254
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,200
I wish I have a map.

255
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,300
Alright.

256
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Hack time.

257
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm in.

258
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,920
A compartment.

259
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,750
I guess this was- Oh, it opened back the subway entrance.

260
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,730
Citizens of Arkham.

261
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,720
Facility.

262
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,700
A new inmate.

263
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:57,030
More nostalgic among you will- Oh, wait, he's the mayor?

264
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,830
Why did we nominate him?

265
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,610
How the fuck did he become mayor?

266
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,990
No, it doesn't.

267
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,890
I don't get it.

268
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,510
We'll be sent there.

269
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,070
Yeah.

270
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:09,990
Scrub that.

271
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,150
How the hell did Strange even manage to have the mayor arrested?

272
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,190
I don't know, Barbara.

273
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,050
Brides.

274
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,790
But I am going to find out.

275
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,070
That's what bribes are for.

276
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,850
Okay, interrogate Quincy Sharp for information on Hugo Strange.

277
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,470
Are any of these side missions fun?

278
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,280
Like, are any of them actually, like, fun lore-wise?

279
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,560
Or are they, like, annoying?

280
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,300
Yeah?

281
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,320
Alright, which one's a fun one?

282
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
All of them?

283
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,320
Alright, which one's a fun one?

284
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,840
Choose one.

285
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,740
I'll do one side.

286
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,900
I'll go to one side quest instead of saving the city.

287
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,400
Like, one of my robins can take care of the saving part.

288
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,160
That's what having seven children that I've adopted is for.

289
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,940
That's crazy why I don't have a robin helping.

290
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:14,100
me right now like what's the point of adopting seven kids which one AR no that does not sound fun the AR the body near the green this one the plain one

291
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:34,320
they do not need a sleep our entire job is to do things at night what the fuck why did why did nightwing name himself nightwing if he's not gonna fucking do save crime at night

292
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,980
well change his name to gay wing.

293
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,290
Which one do we do?

294
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,590
Do we do the doctors one?

295
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,750
The SOS?

296
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,010
The distress?

297
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,650
We're not doing AI training.

298
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,030
I heard AI training sucks.

299
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,030
Or the...

300
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,790
An identified murder victim.

301
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,630
He's in another city.

302
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,430
Who gives him the right to move?

303
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,870
If I can't move, he can't move.

304
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:42,630
I bet there's not even that much crime and blood even doctor or body near okay I will do this one we'll do that one he's a grown ass man living off of my inheritance you think he had he's living off of my money that I earned from beating up criminals there's no way bloodhaven is worse than Gotham City.

305
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:53,210
Or maybe, I mean, it could be, because there's no actual billionaire to, like, you know, um, have, at least they have, like, at least Gotham has good health care.

306
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,650
That's the only they could think of.

307
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,150
Wait, how could Bloodhaven be Jersey when Gotham is Jersey?

308
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,290
What is it?

309
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,110
Is it like, is Gotham old Jersey and then Bloodhaven is New Jersey?

310
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,880
Gotham is New York City.

311
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,820
Oh, Gotham is New York City.

312
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,140
Wait, that's the key.

313
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,900
Wait, then who's the billionaire in New York City?

314
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,080
What's this say?

315
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,760
What is this?

316
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,620
Tim.

317
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,380
There's the body.

318
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,770
I can't leave the mayor to die.

319
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,750
I need to go back.

320
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,050
Oh.

321
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,130
Wait, whose body is this?

322
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,400
How is he murdered?

323
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,620
Sad is deceased.

324
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,480
Is that not how I'm supposed to...

325
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,560
That's him.

326
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm trying to scan it.

327
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,360
How do I scan it?

328
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,350
Oh, I have to do the mirror first?

329
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,570
Oh, he's not letting me do the side quest.

330
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,590
Ah, Batman's like, I don't care.

331
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,890
You're not important enough.

332
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,510
Guess I'll cancel it then.

333
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,140
Batman's just like, you're not that important to me.

334
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,240
He only investigates dead people whose net worth is at least a million dollars.

335
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,520
That's true.

336
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,180
Yeah, you're right.

337
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,940
He's not paying any hospital bills.

338
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,760
He's a ugly son of a bitch coming back here and telling me You got beaten up by someone else.

339
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,020
I've got a reputation to hold in here.

340
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,080
I can't just let them all think I've got some whiny little bitch working for me, can I?

341
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,720
Whoa!

342
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,080
Why?

343
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,860
It's because I'm about to hurt you so bad.

344
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,760
Oh, it's over here.

345
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,300
If any of those other jumps come up to you, you'll stab them in the face rather than...

346
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,600
Hey.

347
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,420
It's Batman!

348
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,660
There you go.

349
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm a hero!

350
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,320
I was like, you'll do what?

351
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,400
Oh, I did it.

352
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,600
I rescued someone.

353
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,420
Alright, nice.

354
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,520
Hey, guys.

355
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,680
What are you guys talking about?

356
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,920
I thought he was going to kill me.

357
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,860
Yeah, you're right.

358
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,800
You thought he was going to kill me?

359
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,360
You thought he was going to kill you?

360
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,920
No, no, no.

361
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
You can't kill.

362
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,780
I need you in the hospital.

363
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,200
If he kills you, we lose another potential patient.

364
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,380
Alright.

365
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,000
Let's see.

366
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,480
Is it worth it to just upgrade armor instead of all the other stuff?

367
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,840
I feel like I don't use any of these other things.

368
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,180
I don't use my gadgets that much for fighting.

369
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,320
Loitering is a crime.

370
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,400
That's right.

371
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,700
I don't know.

372
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,700
Disruptor update.

373
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,580
Oh, it will?

374
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,980
Which one is that?

375
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,720
Is it this one?

376
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,800
this one.

377
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,780
Oh, Firearm Jammer.

378
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,400
There you go.

379
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:52,180
Normally, without the enemy being aware that the guns are carrying, once disabled, these targets are shown as blue, and Detectable, so you can be easily undentified.

380
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm also used to disable... Oh, okay.

381
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,280
I'll try that.

382
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,000
LT.

383
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,020
Heart RT.

384
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,780
I'll get the destructor.

385
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,900
Alright, get there.

386
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,220
It's here, right?

387
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,420
It's above me.

388
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,320
I remember you from the asylum.

389
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:29,240
You personally ordered a six-week course of electroshock therapy to cure my more violent here oh is it here oh it's here well guess what it didn't work wait i can use my new thing where's my disruptor

390
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:46,220
i dragged your sorry ass to my new boss he'll make me his right hand man for sure all right watch this

391
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,640
Self!

392
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,640
Self!

393
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,500
Self!

394
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,400
And that's how you stealth.

395
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,260
Wait, how did he unjam himself?

396
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,560
The whole thing was to jam it.

397
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,920
Oh.

398
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,520
There you go.

399
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,360
It's jammed.

400
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,460
So you can't do anything.

401
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,780
There you go.

402
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,700
And then...

403
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,280
Oh, wait, he got back up.

404
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,120
That's illegal.

405
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,840
That's fucking right.

406
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,480
Get out of here!

407
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,680
Boom!

408
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,560
Alright.

409
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,570
It jams until he reloads it.

410
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,640
Alright, oh, there's the mirror.

411
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,900
I'll color blue.

412
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,840
Five foot eight.

413
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,240
Quincy Sharp was a warden of Arkham Asylum on the night that the Joker broke free.

414
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:01,500
Unknown to both, but discovered by Batman, Sharps suffered from a split personality assortment, accompanying atrocities in Asylum, believing himself to be possessed by a spirit.

415
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:14,980
In reality, he was being influenced by Hugo Strange, who had provided Sharps with powerful mind-controlled drugs that allowed him to manipulate Sharps' behavior, enable him to plant the seeds that led to oh, so he doesn't have a split personality.

416
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,940
Strange was just like on, his brain is not okay after that.

417
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,020
Like, I'm pretty sure he lost like 50% of his cognitive ability.

418
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,620
How did he get even nominated?

419
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:37,220
Like he, I will say like during Arkham, I feel like the warden of like Arkham, he was not a good warden in Arkham Asylum.

420
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,920
What were the amount of criminals that never, because the whole point of the asylum is that it is used to rehabilitate the criminals?

421
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:51,060
Because that's why Batman puts him made the asylum, put him in the asylum, because he thinks like he could fix them.

422
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,760
But like, they go to the asylum and they're never fixed.

423
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,220
And I would say he is a terrible warden.

424
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,440
I would

425
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:20,450
say, I will say, knowing that he has not succeeded in rehabilitating any of the criminals in the asylum, why the fuck would I nominate him as mayor of Crime City?

426
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,210
Like, It was worth a shot.

427
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,130
Okay, interrogation time.

428
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:29,930
Oh,

429
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,520
that's not good with the blood in his brain.

430
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,600
His already very much dead brain.

431
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,000
I'll tell you everything.

432
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,680
Strange came to me back at the asylum.

433
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,900
He told me he had friends, powerful friends, the sort of people who could make things happen.

434
00:39:51,580 --> 00:40:19,660
All I had to do was turn a blind eye to a his experiments and work on my campaign he said his friends would ensure that i won who are they oh that's how he won oh it was actually corruption i was like how the who the voted for him i'm pretty sure like voter turnout is also very low in gotham city because then it requires the people to go outside it made perfect sense the scum of gotham needed

435
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:30,660
has been removing anyone with evidence again it's always corruption enjoy your legacy

436
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:55,940
that's how he got in the power okay he really would vote for this guy okay we put joker in the asylum last week and now he's out again i just had a chat with my old friend quincy sharp he confirmed that strange is working with someone else i'm going to find out who what are you You need to get that blood to freeze now.

437
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:56,940
I will.

438
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
I just need to.

439
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,460
No, you don't.

440
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,120
You need

441
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,010
me.

442
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,310
Oh, there it is.

443
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,150
Who's that guy?

444
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,550
Hello?

445
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,670
Hey.

446
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,460
Who are you?

447
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,760
Hey there.

448
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,520
Wait, who's this guy, Moon?

449
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,720
Is he the Moon Knight NPC?

450
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,400
I have been watching you, Batman.

451
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,140
Me?

452
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,360
To see if you are ready.

453
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,900
Oh, fuck.

454
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,920
What the fuck?

455
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,560
Ready for what?

456
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,810
Who is this mysterious?

457
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,450
Who is the mysterious figure?

458
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,610
Save vigilant for the sightings and scan the clues he leaves behind.

459
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,630
He's like the Catholic Moon Knight.

460
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,290
He looks like Moon Knight.

461
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,310
Unknown, unknown, unknown.

462
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,130
He's like Moon Knight if red.

463
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,570
Do I do?

464
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,710
How do I... Does he leave any more clues?

465
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,370
Hey Batman, can you hear me?

466
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,070
It's Officer Jones back at the museum.

467
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,310
Oh, it's a map-based puzzle.

468
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:26,750
Oh.

469
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,670
Guess I will never complete it.

470
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,170
Alright, now we can do this one.

471
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:39,190
It's very appropriate that he's like the DC version of Moon Knight.

472
00:42:44,530 --> 00:43:17,460
this way all right time to scan all right how did you die i should scan the crime scene to determine the cause of death how did you die fixation has been removed and the head wrapped in bandages what there have been three murders in gotham over the last month with the same mo the press have nicknamed the killer the identity thief if he's now in arkham city i need to track him down and stop Oh wow,

473
00:43:17,760 --> 00:44:04,460
I bet for criminals, this is like prime real estate Because like I would say I'd rather like I don't know I'd rather like be in a city with Batman than be in a city with Superman Because the Superman can just like you like think about the crime and it's over for you Like because he has like super speed like super speed fly and strength Batman at least he takes time to get to you It's likely to have trace elements of the blood on them without realizing i'll filter the scanner to track the victim's blood particles that should lead me to the last person to see the victim alive maybe even the killer himself all right follow the blood trails where is it oh there it is i'm following

474
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,670
wait where's the rest of the blood oh there it is

475
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:27,290
following the trail it's nice that he he left a lot of blood If he didn't die from getting his face ripped up, I think he would have died from, like, blood loss.

476
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,590
Oh, hello.

477
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,230
Who's this guy?

478
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,570
Why did you kill him?

479
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:33,610
It wasn't me.

480
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:34,570
I'm not a killer.

481
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,790
I'm a plumber, for God's sake.

482
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,110
You've got to believe me.

483
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,930
I don't have to believe anything.

484
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:39,950
Tell me what you saw.

485
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,270
There was this guy.

486
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,830
He dropped the body there.

487
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,210
He was weird looking.

488
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,170
You won't believe me, but, well, he looked like Bruce Wayne.

489
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,170
What?

490
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,170
Oh, it's...

491
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,130
Someone must have got to him.

492
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,550
He was covered in cuts and bruises.

493
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:53,510
name.

494
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:54,890
Oh, it's this guy.

495
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,830
I know this criminal.

496
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,230
He used to be a rich boy, too.

497
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,190
He got, like, super jealous of Bruce Wayne.

498
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,710
Is it... It's Hush, right?

499
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,210
Yeah.

500
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,570
I know this criminal.

501
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,690
I know that guy.

502
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,210
I should look out for them.

503
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,510
Yeah, Thomas Elliot.

504
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,910
Yeah, he got, like, super jealous of Bruce and went, like, super crazy.

505
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,770
Of course I know his, though.

506
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,050
I told you, I'm a DC guy.

507
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,830
Wait, what did he tell me to do?

508
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,070
Wayne knew what he was doing.

509
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,330
Oh, fuck.

510
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,170
The phone's ringing.

511
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,090
Where's the phone?

512
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,890
Alright, there's... Yeah, it's hush.

513
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,830
Yeah, they're like childhood friends and stuff.

514
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,710
Find my phone now, Batman.

515
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,090
Or I'll carve this man's existence into my flesh.

516
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,470

517
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,730

It's on the other side.

528
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,580
We made it.

529
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,080
With one minute despair.

530
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,500

I took to gambling.

534
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,700
God, there's no joke.

535
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,560
Where I am today.

536
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,080
Oh my god, he's literally Stewie 2K.

537
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,840
I think he just needs someone to talk to.

538
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,160
Like, I don't think he needs crying.

539
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,580
He just, he actually just needs a therapist.

540
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,320
Why we did it.

541
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,660
Oh my god, now we go back.

542
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,600
I forgot, like...

543
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,500
Okay, what is this?

544
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,340
Stop the random act of violence against...

545
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,500
Oh, wait, is this the...

546
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,720
Is this the Hush one?

547
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,960
Wait, what is this?

548
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:02,160
I lost the trail for Hush Because, oh my god, I don't even know how to do the hush one.

549
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,400
Because, because he fucking randomly called me.

550
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:16,120
No, no, I meant like, um, I meant like I lost the quest line for it.

551
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,720
Because, uh, Zaz called me and everything.

552
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,380
Oh, I need to find, oh, I finished it?

553
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,560
Oh, okay.

554
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,980
I just got, oh, you need to find another body.

555
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,800
Oh, okay.

556
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,340
I don't remember fully.

557
00:49:33,360 --> 00:50:00,040
about Thomas Elliot's story but like I remember his like origin like the the whole like fucking cutting faces off and stuff and how he like tried so hard to look like how they were he and Bruce were like childhood friends and he's like his whole thing is that he he like he doesn't really have any superpowers he's just like a murderer um and like his face is covered in bandages and stuff because he got like plastic surgery

558
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,170
He's just weird, but I feel like, I feel like, uh...

559
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,170
That's just majority of the criminals.

560
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,030
They're just weird.

561
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,970
Yeah, he's like a- yeah, he's a- Oh yeah, yeah, now remember, he's a surgeon.

562
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,830
And he does, like, surgeries on himself.

563
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,260
Uh...

564
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,200
Oh, we gotta go this way.

565
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,960
Man, it's cold in here.

566
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,360
Tell me about it.

567
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,120
There's someone here?

568
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,140
Oh, okay, I thought there was someone in this random ship.

569
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,840
Woo-wee-wee-wee.

570
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,440
Oh, I forgot.

571
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,540
Probably froze up his old lady.

572
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,500
But did she look good to you?

573
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,100
In this place, they all look good.

574
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,760
What's stopping it?

575
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,880
I don't know.

576
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,340
It keeps freezing back up.

577
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:09,880
Yay!

578
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:11,940

Alright.

582
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,810
Jesus Christ.

583
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,280
I counted!

584
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,100
My fingers were just too fast, guys.

585
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,360
My fingers were just so fast.

586
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,580
Okay, I got an idea.

587
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,460
Is there,

588
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:51,980
like, a guy?

589
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,400
Imagine that could...

590
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,200
What if I...

591
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,780
It's the bath.

592
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,500
Wherever you've gone, Batman, I'll find you.

593
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,760
Where is it coming from?

594
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,760
Where is it coming from?

595
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,400
Wait, I can literally...

596
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,040
Wait a minute.

597
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:19,600
Battery!

598
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,280
You scared to fight us?

599
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,980
I have the high ground.

600
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,220
That's okay, right?

601
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,020
I've got the high ground now, boys!

602
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,220
It's not hiding!

603
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,100
It's called strategy!

604
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,140
And then...

605
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,200
Glide kick!

606
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,360
Boom!

607
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,100
There we go.

608
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,480
I'm right here.

609
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,180
Oh my god.

610
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,240
He fucking distracted.

611
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,760
What the fuck?

612
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,520
There you go.

613
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:11,960
I don't know.

614
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,720
My wife's not working right now.

615
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,020
I'm trying to do the counter.

616
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,560
Okay, there you go.

617
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,580
Got it.

618
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:20,820
That's right.

619
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,900
I got aim assist.

620
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,560
My fist got the aim assist, bro.

621
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:25,800
Bro?

622
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,340
Wait, wait, wait, I know what to do.

623
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,740
Wait, how do I...

624
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,620
Oh, there we go.

625
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,420
Boom!

626
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,840
I remember now.

627
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:38,880
Stun!

628
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,760
There we go.

629
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,200
Jesus, come on, let me punch him!

630
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,680
Non-lethal bomb!

631
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,560
Okay, we got...

632
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,420
Oh god, okay.

633
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,000
I think I got that guy out of it.

634
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:01,990
That's right.

635
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,210
Get the beat down!

636
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,670
Alright.

637
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:11,750
Nice, I got this done.

638
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:14,510
Oh my god.

639
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,730
Sometimes, for some reason, the Y isn't working.

640
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,710
I might need a new controller.

641
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,690
I'm using the Xbox controller right now.

642
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,390
Wait, what?

643
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,130
There we go.

644
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:30,790
Unfortunately, the...

645
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,990
The Batman game doesn't...

646
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,690
Uh...

647
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:34,310
Wait, it's not...

648
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,370
No, counter is why?

649
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,370
Why do you keep doing this to me?

650
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,470
Is this.

651
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:44,030
Oh, I can't counter the armor guys?

652
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:44,730
Oh!

653
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:49,810
I can't.

654
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,890
The Batman game doesn't allow me to use...

655
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,830
Doesn't recognize PlayStation for some reason.

656
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,350
If I could, I would.

657
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:09,850
I love it when Doki goes full shooter, oops, all projectile in the game before remembering to go back to the intended game mechanics.

658
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,570
Jakato, thank you, super chat, thank you, thank you.

659
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,310
Are there people here?

660
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,050
Oh, there are.

661
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,390
Oh, wait, I can hack this.

662
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,070
What's over here?

663
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,910
Oh, you snake.

00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,500
No wonder they, like, gave me so much area to move around in.

672
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,680
Oh my god, I don't know.

673
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,680
What does he want me to do?

674
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,680
Yes, I can.

675
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,320
Watch me.

676
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,260
Hee.

677
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,790
Like, what am I supposed to do?

678
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,510
Am I supposed to use the floor grates and be like, peekaboo

679
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,730
wait what how does he know

680
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:25,720
oh I have to sneak attack him there's no way oh he knows there's no way he knows guys how did he know and

681
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,750
he froze them

682
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,850
oh you can see he that's fucked up

683
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,620
I'll figure this out.

684
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,320
I'm trying to figure out how to freeze it.

685
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,320
That's cheating.

686
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,680
No way he knows I'm here.

687
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,060
There's no way.

688
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,420
Wait, what?

689
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,590
There's no way.

690
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:25,110
No, you don't.

691
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,780
No, you don't.

692
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,240
That's silly.

693
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,020
Okay.

694
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,020
Whenever I do this, and I go all the way around him, you think he'll know?

695
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,990
And then I'm like, sneaky, sneaky.

696
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:49,970
Sneaky, sneaky.

697
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,470
That's right, got you, bitch!

698
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:54,570
Damage, don't look behind.

699
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,590
Behind them!

700
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:59,550
That's right!

701
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:00,550
Boom!

702
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,610
Oh shit.

703
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,430
What if I do that again?

704
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,840
Yeah?

705
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,240
Oh shit.

706
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,180
Yeah?

707
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,740
Oh shit!

708
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,140
I need to keep changing my tactics.

709
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,760
Oh my god, wait, that's not fair.

710
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,560
Wait, what do you mean I have to keep changing my tactics?

711
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,040
But it worked.

712
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,460
What do you mean?

713
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,080
I don't know what that means.

714
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,000
I can't believe it.

715
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,660
You mean I can't cheese?

716
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,260
That's right.

717
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,340
Wait, what?

718
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,640
I can't allow Freeze to see me.

719
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,340
Wait, what?

720
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:17,920
I'm stuck.

721
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:18,880
I'm stuck.

722
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:19,680
Bro!

723
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,240
Get out!

724
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,020
Oh!

725
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,870
That's...

726
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,210
I all got him!

727
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,710
I was literally inside him!

728
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,050
That's not fair.

729
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,690
He fucking cheated!

730
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,390
He actually cheated!

731
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:54,290
That's fucking a bullshit!

732
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,840
That's right, get out of here!

733
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,950
That's fucking rock, got you now, bitch!

734
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,220
Fucking cheating ass!

735
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,730
Bro, that guy literally cheated!

736
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,490
I don't know.

737
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:27,870
Oh!

738
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,630
Whoopsie.

739
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:32,710
Whoopsie.

740
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,590
What are...

741
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,690
Tactics can I do?

742
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:45,690
Try to figure out what else I could do.

743
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:51,870
Fuck you!

744
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:53,770
That's right!

745
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,350
Fuck you and your wife!

746
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,820
Where is he?

747
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,890
Your movements are all too easy to track.

748
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:13,970
I

749
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:24,400
know someone was like, do it takedown.

750
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,260
And I was like, how?

751
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,000
Oh my God, he took, he fucking hit, destroyed all the vents.

752
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,260
Fuck you and your wife.

753
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,200
Trap down!

754
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,240
That's right.

755
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,280
Take that.

756
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,780
Boom!

757
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:54,740
Bye.

758
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,740
That's right.

759
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,280
That's right.

760
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,100
Bye.

761
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,320
Got your wife again.

762
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,600
Yeah.

763
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,060
I feel like... Wait.

764
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,480
Whoops.

765
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,700
That's not what I want to do.

766
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,760
I'm trying to figure out what other takedowns I can do.

767
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,080
Because there's clearly two more takedowns.

768
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,340
I could have got a takedown right here.

769
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,100
I'm so sad.

770
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:30,620
If the thing didn't...

771
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,980
If I didn't fucking go, like, right inside the freeze.

772
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,110
Or magnetize him.

773
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:41,870
This?

774
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:43,630
What do I...

775
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,070
How do I magnetize him?

776
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,630
There's another explosive wall?

777
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:53,550
Oh, there it is.

778
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,490
It's right here.

779
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,670
Try for how to get there.

780
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:04,720
Okay.

781
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,160
There's another wall here.

782
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:14,350
Okay, right here.

783
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,210
I just need him to go right here.

784
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,270
He'll walk over here, right?

785
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,330
Surely he'll walk over here, right?

786
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:29,070
Oh, I deactivated his gun?

787
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,730
Oh my god, you're a genius.

788
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:34,090
Okay.

789
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:38,570
Oh, wait, what?

790
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,790
Oh, shit, nice.

791
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:45,830
He's too busy fixing.

792
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:52,910
tech support that's right who is he doing tech support

793
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:10,280

794
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:25,360

795
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,260
What?

796
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:30,960
Oh.

797
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,060
That's fucking right!

798
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,900
Damn, should not have wore suit filled with metal, bitch!

799
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,760
Your lucky Magneto is X-Men!

800
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,620
Stop beating yourself, nerd!

801
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,960
Stop hitting yourself!

802
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,930
You're so lucky that Magneto's Marvel?

803
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,460
Please, find Nora.

804
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,760
She's all I have left.

805
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,200
You're so stupid.

806
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,520
If I was at 100%, it'd be easier for me to find Nora.

807
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,480
It's over.

808
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,260
What?

809
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,020
That was a lucky manufacturer.

810
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,200
Harley Quinn took it.

811
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,380
What are you waiting for?

812
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,020
Go and get it back.

813
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,960
The clown must pay for what he has done to us.

814
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,580
It's not that simple.

815
01:09:34,600 --> 01:10:05,320

Or Nora freeze.

818

Beautiful Nora found undying love when she married the shy but brilliant cryogenesis Victor freeze.

819
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,860
Freeze Nora stays suspended until you get fired at care.

820
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,980
Since then, Nora has been trapped between life and death.

821
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,380
Yeah, you don't want me to fucking cut the power off of Gotham City.

822
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,580
Then she'll not have life support.

823
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,180
anymore.

824
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,060
Oh, I leveled up.

825
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,940
Okay, the firearm jam was actually pretty good.

826
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,320
Now I go back to...

827
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,840
Oh, heat signature conceal.

828
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,460
Okay, I like that.

829
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,800
That should be good.

830
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,980
Yeah, he's German.

831
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,120
That's why it's freeze fries.

832
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,080
That's why I are no J there.

833
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,520

Gotham?

I don't know if you can hear me.

847
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,360
My newscopter has been shot down.

848
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,460
We crashed down somewhere in Arkham City.

849
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,720
We need help.

850
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:37,280
I am now stuck on part of the old Gotham freeway.

851
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,280
In what looks like a turf war between...

852
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,260
What the hell was that?

853
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,360
Oh god, there are snipers.

854
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,940
She'll be okay, right, guys?

855
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,720
I can see what looks like inmates moving in on us.

856
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,500
I need to save Vicky Vale.

857
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,360
She'll die if I leave her.

858
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,100
It's okay, it's not timed.

859
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,160
This is Vicky Vale.

860
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,200
I repeat, this is Vicky Vale.

861
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,700
If you can hear this, help me.

862
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,520
She's fine.

863
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,120
Oh.

864
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,520
It's a movie to die.

865
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,720
That's, I'll be here to protect Gotham.

866
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,700
Guys, I think Vicky I'll die.

867
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:10,480
All right.

868
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,020
You love Vicky Vale.

869
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,560
How is she that important?

870
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,220
She's just a journalist.

871
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:26,340
Wow, Doki, in a dying media.

872
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:37,620
I'm surprised that Clark Kent still has a job at the newspaper company.

873
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:51,690
Don't worry, I'm slowly flying over.

874
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:53,890
Don't worry.

875
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,470
Don't worry, I'm here.

876
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:03,510
I'm joking

877
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,280
really is Owlman.

878
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,600
I honestly relate more to Owlman than Batman.

879
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,000
In the universe where Superman killed Joker.

880
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:29,040
At least Superman got the job done, you know?

881
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,710
There you go.

882
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,170
We did it.

883
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,570
It appears that the sniper is covering my position from the southeast have gone.

884
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:44,510
The roof of the curse is...

885
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:47,250
Yeah, yeah, somehow, for some reason, they're gone.

886
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:48,730
Or someone has taken them out.

887
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:55,650
Okay, stuff to take out down is not as cool as just beating them with my raw fist.

888
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,790
Alright, there you go.

889
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:03,790
If anyone can hear this broadcast, send help, please.

890
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:05,170
I'm here.

891
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,090
I can hear you.

892
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,900
You should be safe here for now.

893
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:50,830
stay here and keep out of sight any chance I could get an exclusive she's straight I saved your life no sorry I need a feed oh is that the Mad Hatter yeah I was gonna say it's the Mad Hatter who are you talking to no see what you've done I actually I knew Mad Hatter from Teen Titans this one wasn't from the comics I mean she's just like my knowledge of Mad Hatter that you caused.

894
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:51,410
At

895
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,690
least I answered your call, man.

896
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,180
The spotted man would have saved the helicopter.

897
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,940
That she should have worked in New York City!

898
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,310
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

899
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:15,670
Thank you.

900
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,330
Thank you.

901
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,850
It appears I'm safe.

902
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:18,730
For now.

903
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:20,630
Yeah, who saved you?

904
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,830
That's fucking right.

905
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:25,210
Like certain death at the hands of snipers, all working for the Joker.

906
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:26,730
Yeah, Matt Hatter wasn't Teen Titans.

907
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:53,890
rifles in a maximum security prison that got them is a question i intend to put to professor strange if i ever get out of here i think that's weird shocked at the conditions on the ground live in gotham city facility you can literally go to a walmart and get a sniper here running wild murder and that's how big gotham city is right now complete lack of authority we were told that arkham city is good for gotham if that's true good comes at a price we shouldn't have to pay

908
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:58,830
the city.

909
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:03,390
Yeah, that sounds like the best plan.

910
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:12,810
Wait, what?

911
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:13,990
Good news, Master Bruce.

912
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,000
All right.

913
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,400
Oh, he did it.

914
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,740
Alfred did it.

915
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,980
See, when he is alive, he actually gets things done.

916
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:35,880
Spoiler alert, they killed Alfred again.

917
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:44,500
I mean, not again, but he's been dead for a while in the actual DC universe, which is crazy because it's like, it's, I don't know.

918
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:44,980
I don't know.

919
01:19:45,100 --> 01:20:17,500
Maybe he got, again but like um because they always bring people back oh is he back again oh sorry spoiler alert he came back again they keep killing him off i can't keep track i can't keep track with because they also killed off batman for one second too for a bit they also killed off batman as well like for a while and then they're like damian had to like take over as batman and everything and then and then he came back he's like they're like jk he's alive Yeah,

920
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,460
no one ever actually did.

921
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:20,660
Like, go for the...

922
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,500
I should go for the cure.

923
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,860
I should go for my cure first.

924
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,740
He died, but then he got better.

925
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,840
Yeah, they had a whole fucking funeral and everything.

926
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,320
They dedicated entire issue to the fact that he was dead.

927
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,840
Like, a whole series about him being dead.

928
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,380
And then they're like, JK, he's alive.

929
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,120
I don't remember if it was because he faked his death or, like...

930
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,540
I don't remember the exact...

931
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:55,620
happens all the time so like i don't remember if he faked this death or like they like it was like jason where they resurrected him because it's hard to keep track at that point

932
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,060
silent oh that's fine there's way too many people here i'm just gonna leave

933
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,000
there's too many people i just leave

934
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:20,100
oh it's batman's just imagining him oh he's just oh batman's just being crazy as usual skitsa as usual.

935
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:23,820
Yeah, Uncle Ben stayed dead because he was only there for one issue.

936
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,580
Like, literally the first comic.

937
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,420
So it makes sense that they kept him dead, but, like, Alfred's been there forever.

938
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,420
JK, he didn't die.

939
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,180
He got sent back in time for some reason.

940
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,240
Comic logic.

941
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:44,240
Wait, how come they put him on hot ground now?

942
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,380
That's fucked up.

943
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,360
One of the guys saw him.

944
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,260
Oh my god, now they're all just in high ground?

945
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,980
Get your ass out of here.

946
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,120
Let's get these guys out of here.

947
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,360
Only I get high ground.

948
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:11,650
Alright.

949
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,530
Holy Batman has that privilege.

950
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,010
Who's he saying that to?

951
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:21,230
I'm not, though.

952
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:22,810
Oh.

953
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:27,110
All right, give me a sec.

954
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:31,490
I reached the objective for it.

955
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,590
I did?

956
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,030
Where is it?

957
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,340
Apparently I reached the objective.

958
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,220
Where is it?

959
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,300
I might be thinking about Teen Titans Go.

960
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,060
Because I have watched Teen Titans Go.

961
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,680
I know he has appeared in the Teen Titans.

962
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:53,800
Or the comics.

963
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,800
Because I did read...

964
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,360
I did...

965
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,460
Oh, I guess I'll help you.

966
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,200
Because the cure is...

967
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:27,300
right there you're so lucky the cure is here i did i did also read the they did do the comic series based off of the original t titans i'm gonna find some place safe to hide i knew mad hatter appeared in one of them oh did i watch the drop oh my god are you fucking kidding me okay i gotta get the cure first

968
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,010
Oh, is it this?

969
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:35,010
Oh, it is.

970
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,620
Batman the Animist.

971
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,480
I actually never watched the Batman Animist series.

972
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,460
I only watched the one episode

973
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:52,450
where...

974
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:52,790
What?

975
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,350
What happened?

976
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,090
Oh, it's the Mad Hatter!

977
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:04,010
I watched the episode about the...

978
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,270
What's her name, the little girl?

979
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:07,270
I can never grow up.

980
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,430
What's going on?

981
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:09,950
What a question.

982
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,170
Shall I tell him?

983
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,610
Oh, he looks so confused.

984
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:14,850
Maybe I should.

985
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,150
Well, it's so cool.

986
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,790
I planted a teeny tiny little idea.

987
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:19,770
Baby doll, yeah.

988
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:20,970
That's the episode I watched.

989
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,210
That was a good episode.

990
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:28,770
I'm sure you wouldn't understand, but as you can see, it worked.

991
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:30,510
You're mine now.

992
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:34,230
You're mine, and there's nothing that Strange can do about it.

993
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:37,630
Oh, are you not going to drink your tea?

994
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,050
It's special tea.

995
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:41,630
My special tea.

996
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:43,410
My special tea.

997
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,170
Go to hell, Jervis.

998
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:52,710
Simply put, I made you see what you wanted most.

999
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,250
Oh, it was all hallucination.

1000
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:57,970
Alfred didn't find the cure.

1001
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:58,830
Oh, tell me.

1002
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:02,450
So predictable, just like Alice.

1003
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:06,930
Never doing what I want without ludicrous amounts of psychoactive control.

1004
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:08,310
That's fucked up, bro.

1005
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:13,430
Well, if that's what's necessary, it's a good job that you've already taken them.

1006
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:15,730
All we need now is a finish.

1007
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,730
Does she want to take psychological drugs?

1008
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:22,590
Ah!

1009
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:27,410
You are my soldier now, Batman.

1010
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:30,030
You will do everything I say.

1011
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:34,830
That's the one where the Baby Dumb episode.

1012
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,290
I didn't really watch the...

1013
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:37,870
What the fuck?

1014
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:40,850
What's going on?

1015
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:41,910
No, no, no, no.

1016
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,590
This isn't right.

1017
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:45,170
You can't be doing this.

1018
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:46,050
What the fuck?

1019
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,770
Holy shit.

1020
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,410
Oh, I'm going crazy.

1021
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,150
It belongs to me now.

1022
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,730
Oh, don't tell Joker.

1023
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:56,050
He's gonna be very mad.

1024
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:59,970
Shh, don't tell Joker.

1025
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,430
He's very jealous.

1026
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:05,450
He gets very, very jealous.

1027
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:15,210
You're running out of time.

1028
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:16,010
Wait, I'm timed?

1029
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,910
I'm just working, beating people up.

1030
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:22,750
Like I always do.

1031
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,150
Stop fighting it.

1032
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:34,390
Wait, am I supposed to punch him?

1033
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:35,330
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

1034
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,000
How am I supposed to know?

1035
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,940
Oh, I'm on a drive clock.

1036
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:46,540
I was gonna say, how the fuck am I supposed to know I'm tagged?

1037
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,360
There's a giant clock I'm under.

1038
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,960
You cannot win.

1039
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,700
You can't fight it.

1040
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:00,760
Okay.

1041
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,460
No, I tried to get him!

1042
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:08,320
Okay.

1043
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,460
Jesus Christ, there's so many.

1044
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,540
Stop him.

1045
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:22,780
Stop him.

1046
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,000
I'm my best.

1047
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,180
Oh, I'm 1 HP.

1048
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:27,840
I should have to pay attention.

1049
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,880
Let all your troubles fade away.

1050
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,260
Bro, there's so many.

1051
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,080
I'm...

1052
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,640
Oh, my God.

1053
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,360
No!

1054
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:48,660
I couldn't!

1055
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,780
I was surrounded!

1056
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,060
Oh, my God.

1057
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,700
That's not fair.

1058
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:57,560
There were 20 people surrounding him that couldn't hit him.

1059
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,160
That's actually not fair.

1060
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:09,080
Stop him.

1061
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,260
Stop him.

1062
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,580
Wait, why can't it...

1063
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,540
Oh my gosh, I'm trying to throw my nades.

1064
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,810
It won't let me.

1065
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:18,460
There you go.

1066
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,940
I wish I can use my...

1067
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,300
Use this gadget more often.

1068
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:29,840
Okay.

1069
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:30,720
Okay.

1070
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:32,600
Relax.

1071
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,100
I wish I can lock in.

1072
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:43,110
Yeah.

1073
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,870
Got you?

1074
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:50,940
Alright.

1075
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,690
There's so many people!

1076
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:05,640
Oh my god.

1077
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,360
I'm locking in.

1078
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,980
I'm locking in.

1079
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:15,740
Okay.

1080
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,800
My hat's a special.

1081
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,040
They make everyone do what I want.

1082
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,080
Everyone.

1083
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:20,920
Okay.

1084
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,140
We gotta go over.

1085
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,300
fade away.

1086
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:24,920
There we go.

1087
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,520
I got it.

1088
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,490
Jesus, there's so many.

1089
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:35,710
Come on.

1090
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,450
Give me that double takedown.

1091
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:40,110
Nice.

1092
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,250
Alice will be here soon, that man.

1093
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,970
You don't want to miss her, now do you?

1094
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:47,090
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

1095
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:49,890
Bro, you gotta, you gotta be registered.

1096
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,550

01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,810

I can't wait without you.

1106
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,080
He's so pathetic.

1107
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,120
Then you lose.

1108
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,240
He's so fucking pathetic.

1109
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,110
There's no way that's a fitted hat.

1110
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,280
My lovely hair.

1111
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,260
Oh my god, he's so pathetic.

1112
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:06,720
Yo, yeah, the haircut is crazy.

1113
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,680
Yeah, no, no, that is like Ebenezer Scrooge.

1114
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,180
Why did you do it?

1115
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:16,340
I just...

1116
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,460
Friends, don't drug us, they're friends!

1117
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,400
Who taught you that?

1118
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,020
This will be so angry.

1119
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,900
I've let her down terribly.

1120
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,340
Bro, this might as well.

1121
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:29,340
Like, this is just too sad.

1122
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,920
You might as well just shave the whole thing up.

1123
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:31,560
Why did you do it?

1124
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,480
I just wanted a friend.

1125
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,980
A kind of friend that just drug him up and then...

1126
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:42,920
Who taught?

1127
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:52,700
him that exactly who the fuck taught him that all right now we can go save mr freeze's wife

1128
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:18,760
i will say i'm not gonna lie if you are balding in that way just shave it off or like get a hair transplant there's no i'm sorry i don't know like i know like you're like love yourself just do whatever you want to feel but like i will say like if you are balding like just right in the middle,

1129
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:22,600
I feel like at that point, you might as well just shave the entire thing up.

1130
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:23,900
Like, I don't think you can make that work.

1131
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:30,440
I honestly, I'm going to be real, you guys.

1132
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,080
I don't think there's any way you can make that work.

1133
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:37,840
You might as well just go full bod or get a hair transplant.

1134
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:42,760
Do what you gotta do at that point.

1135
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,120
Like, keeping that hairstyle is just coping.

1136
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,460
You got anything to eat?

1137
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,020
Sorry, man.

1138
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,600
I'm out.

1139
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,120
This place is turning to hell.

1140
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,300
Turning to hell.

1141
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:56,460
I'm pretty sure it's already out.

1142
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,700
What about Danny DeVito?

1143
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,400
Yeah, but that's for his acting career.

1144
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,920
Do you have an acting career like Danny DeVito?

1145
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:08,760
He needs to keep his hair like that for Sunny in Philadelphia.

1146
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:11,540
No one's going to be able to get close without us seeing.

1147
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,340
You could use these sniper rifles.

1148
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:13,840
What the?

1149
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:15,700
Get

1150
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:20,690
the last chance.

1151
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,010
My god.

1152
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:26,830
Alright, get this guy out of here.

1153
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:34,490
Like, if you have a career like Daddy DeVito, then you can keep the hairstyle.

1154
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:38,990
Alright, we got another...

1155
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:41,630
We got another voicemail from...

1156
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,170
From the clingy Joker.

1157
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:44,910
Where is it?

1158
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:47,150
Where is he?

1159
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:49,410
I almost found everybody, though.

1160
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:52,990
Alright, voicemail number five.

1161
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:54,330

1162
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:06,290

1164
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,480
Bro, I don't even have the life story.

1165
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,780
Like, he has the equivalent life story of Joker.

1166
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,680
Like, Harley Quinn doesn't even have that privilege.

1167
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,780
How the fuck do I have all your tapes?

1168
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,920
I did one quest, and now I know his entire life.

1169
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:12,480
Obsessed from a young age with Lewis Carroll's book, Alice in Wonderland.

1170
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:47,220
embrace a delusion that used an incarnation of a character in a story the the situation ship absolutely thank you the super chat thank you thank you and like using his skills for mesmerism yeah yeah it's like one quest bro and suddenly i know his entire life story often themed around booked on spire and his love of hats and headgear going as far as to implant his hats with mind control chips to amplify his hypnosis skills above all the other headwear COVID's Batman's distinctive cow,

1171
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,220
and will stop at nothing to acquire it.

1172
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:52,160
All right.

1173
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,940
Patient interview one.

1174
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,800
Subject's name, Jervis Tetch.

1175
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,040
This is like a one-sided relationship here.

1176
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,960
Brought Batman six months ago.

1177
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:09,460
Patient exhibits signs of obsessive compulsion and paranoid schizophrenia.

1178
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,600
I feel like 90% of the criminals have schizophrenia.

1179
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:14,620
I need Alice.

1180
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,960
Get off me.

1181
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,200
Get off me, I'm late.

1182
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,160
I'm wearing Alice.

1183
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,440
Alice isn't here yet.

1184
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:35,600
Yet?

1185
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:37,160
Just relax, Jervis.

1186
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,460
She will be here soon.

1187
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,760
Who is Alice for him?

1188
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,400
Or is that just like in his head?

1189
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,160
Would you like some tea?

1190
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,640
No, I'm afraid not.

1191
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,380
Let us talk while we wait.

1192
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,840
You and I have much in common, Jervis.

1193
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,620
I'm trying to hate my room.

1194
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:02,460
It's so, so hot in my room always.

1195
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:03,700
Unfortunately not.

1196
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,760
You and I both,

1197
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,640
I studied your papers, Jervis.

1198
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,260
You are quite brilliant.

1199
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:16,260
Truly an extraordinary mind.

1200
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:18,460
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1201
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:23,640
It's all just chemicals and synapses and rabbits and...

1202
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,200
Oh, where is Alice?

1203
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:27,980
You need to focus.

1204
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,460
Think about your work for a minute.

1205
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,560
You theorize that there is no such thing as free will.

1206
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,280
That's true!

1207
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,360
Not here.

1208
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:42,280
I tell you what free will is.

1209
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,900
With chemicals.

1210
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,780
Your formula was really quite brilliant.

1211
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,380
That's why I used it.

1212
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:55,080
At least we can create, we can relate in something that had it.

1213
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:55,620
To you?

1214
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,720
Wicked girl.

1215
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,420
Nasty little thing.

1216
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,260
Is she here yet?

1217
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:06,220
My yokey's will is the dragoon's will.

1218
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,620
Spoken like a person with me.

1219
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:41,320
no free will I like that oh he does sound like ants in the wise oh god it's so creepy don't make me shout Alice come out where are you oh my god I see registry oh oh who are these people look again oh I don't know who they are oh Please, is Alice here or not?

1220
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,020
Look at the first picture.

1221
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,180
Look at the dress she is wearing.

1222
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,680
Look at the hair.

1223
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:49,180
He just got a random girl's photo?

1224
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:50,400
No, no, no, no.

1225
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,120
It can't be Alice.

1226
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,720
Alice has nice yellow hair.

1227
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:53,640
What?

1228
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,420
Oh.

1229
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:55,420
Blood.

1230
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,160
Did he kill her?

1231
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,980
I think you know exactly who this is, Mr. Ted.

1232
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:00,440
Oh.

1233
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:06,360
I think you remember the night you lured Stephanie Williams back to your research lab.

1234
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:43,320
offered her tea what happened then no no no what did you do it's okay jervis it's all right to remember how many Alice's were there I can't remember so not all blonde women are Alice bro that's fucked isn't coming is she that all depends on how you I have a little side project that I'm working on.

1235
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,640
I could use your help.

1236
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:46,460
I help.

1237
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:47,320
I can't help.

1238
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:48,440
I'll be late.

1239
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,220
Stay focused, Jervis.

1240
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:55,580
This facility is old, tired, full of ghosts.

1241
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,260
Ghosts?

1242
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,380
A figure of speech.

1243
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,920
Do not worry.

1244
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,780
Arkham Asylum will not exist forever.

1245
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:06,280
Its techniques are old.

1246
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,620
Its mission, now dead.

1247
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,820
Oh, one man would look at this guy and be like, would trust.

1248
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,200
Absolutely, you have a super chat.

1249
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:13,480
Thank you.

1250
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:13,880
Thank you.

1251
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,540
I don't know a child.

1252
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,400
I feel like a child is not known.

1253
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,740
You know, you have to tell children to be like, stranger danger.

1254
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,480
Because they can't recognize when a stranger is dangerous.

1255
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,300
So you have to be like, all strangers are dangerous.

1256
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,210
I need rabbits.

1257
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:37,150
Oh, I ride it.

1258
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:40,070
You and Alice, I know.

1259
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:43,150
You and children aren't that stupid.

1260
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,110
You'd be surprised.

1261
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,490
You'd be very surprised.

1262
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:52,490
Shall we meet again next week?

1263
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:57,070
Oh, and I took the liberty of having your hats returned.

1264
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:02,050
I assume that will provide all the encouragement you require.

1265
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:05,210
All right, last video.

1266
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:06,610
Last recording.

1267
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:11,710
I must say you have outperformed even my wildest expectations.

1268
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:14,590
You're somewhat both smarter, dumber, and crueller than you think.

1269
01:43:14,670 --> 01:44:08,810

Hey.

1272
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:52,250
Okay, I did not expect myself to land like that.

1273
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,890
Not gonna lie.

1274
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:53,810
I thought I could.

1275
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:59,190
I said I was gonna get the quick time attack, but it did not.

1276
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:01,330
Yeah, I mean, like, that's the thing.

1277
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:02,170
It's like asylum.

1278
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:05,750
How the fuck did he smuggled a child into an insane asylum?

1279
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,810
Warden, I thought he was mayor now.

1280
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:12,030
No way could strange get the mayor of Gotham freaking city sent in here.

1281
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,610
Oh my god, it's right over here.

1282
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:20,490
Zass, I'll deal with you later.

1283
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,790
I have fucking guns aimed at my head.

1284
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:28,510
Protocol 10 will commence in one hour.

1285
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:30,870
It's been one hour, five hours ago.

1286
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,070
I don't know about that.

1287
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,340
Alright, we're gonna go over here first.

1288
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:46,890
Alright, nice.

1289
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:51,030
I think the flip was a little bit...

1290
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:51,850
Uh...

1291
01:45:52,630 --> 01:46:07,230
Just a little bit show just to show up, but that's all right All right, time to answer the phone There's a phone ringing somewhere get ready to run All right, where

1292
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,200
All right, where is this phone

1293
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,060
Wait, where is it?

1294
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:20,800
Oh, there it is.

1295
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,500
I was gonna say where is it?

1296
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:24,440
Why don't I see it anywhere?

1297
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:28,720
Oh my god, I literally just got here.

1298
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:30,280
I hate this man so much.

1299
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,100
I actually, I hate this quest.

1300
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,660
I hate this quest line so much.

1301
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:47,580
Because it's always like, I just got to my original area.

1302
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,160
And then they're like, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

1303
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,420
Go across the other...

1304
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,360
Time to go across the other city.

1305
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,680
Yeah, I still do it.

1306
01:47:01,190 --> 01:47:02,270
He knows me.

1307
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:04,410
He knows I'll break into the pressure.

1308
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:14,350
Yeah, I don't have the upgrade.

1309
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:15,270
Not yet.

1310
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:16,830
Oh my god, wait.

1311
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:18,450
I might fail this mission.

1312
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:24,130
Oh, please tell me it's...

1313
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:27,250
JK, it's right here.

1314
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:29,710
Oh my god, it's not right here.

1315
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,340
JK, it's right here.

1316
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:41,820
Oh, time for...

1317
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,980
him the trauma dump again him

1318
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:12,430
playing fair in the casino

1319
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:55,060

1320
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:57,580
Yeah, we gotta cancel them, guys.

1321
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,700
Someone drop that Google Doc here real quick.

1322
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,340
Oh, that sucks, bro.

1323
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:16,760
Alright, attempt number three to get this man's wife back.

1324
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,100
The third time's a charm.

1325
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,720
Alright, here we go, back to Jokerland.

1326
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:35,460
All right, I'm here.

1327
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:38,360
Let me kill the sniper real quick.

1328
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,780
What the hell are you doing?

1329
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:41,900
I told you not to come back empty-handed.

1330
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:42,900
All right, goodbye.

1331
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,720
No, I don't have the zip boost.

1332
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:55,180
Oh, am I supposed to find his wife?

1333
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:04,000
You're not distracting me this time.

1334
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,920
Not a problem.

1335
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:11,040
Sounds like I need to beat some respect into you.

1336
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:11,640
That's right.

1337
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:12,420
Beat him up.

1338
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:13,740
I ain't getting distracted.

1339
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:17,260
I thought we were supposed to have left by now.

1340
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:18,180
Chill out, man.

1341
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:18,800
It's coming.

1342
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,980
Joker wants us to move on into two-faces territory.

1343
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,640
Teach that ugly son of a bitch to mess with the boss.

1344
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:25,460
Where is it?

1345
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,540
It's a miracle, ain't it?

1346
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,800
Yesterday, I figured Joker was a goner.

1347
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,940
Today, he's back better than ever.

1348
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:33,620
I'm back to the other side of Joker, man.

1349
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:34,860
A smile back.

1350
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,900
It's like there's been this other guy standing in here.

1351
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:54,460
in for it but now the real joker's back on my left so we ready soon we wait for the order what's this oh god damn stupid riddle me this he's by the river is this the river

1352
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,040

01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:23,820

1354

1355
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:39,860
is this a boat I don't think this is a boat

1356
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:45,910
I can't see through this

1357
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,840
maybe here

1358
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:00,770
is this a doorway to it

1359
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:07,300
no There's no way to get inside that way.

1360
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:12,830
I'm just gonna kill him first.

1361
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:14,830
Get out of here!

1362
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:17,990
Under?

1363
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:21,230
Is there a way to go under it?

1364
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:27,980
Go back and look down the river.

1365
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,120

1366
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,300

01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,060
Batman can't drown.

1369
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:46,360
Oh, like here?

1370
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:57,120
This feels like a ridler thing.

1371
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:00,440
Because it's green.

01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,360

1376
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:22,890
Stupid ridler.

1377
01:53:29,870 --> 01:53:30,330

1378
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:31,870

1379
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:33,990

01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,950

01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:36,690

01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:37,710

1386
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:24,010

1390
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:36,850

1391
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:41,540
Is that the blue thing?

1392
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,120

There's a secret in here?

1403
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,440
How do I access the secret?

1404
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:22,240

1406
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:25,000

1427
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,900
Oh my god, okay.

1428
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:02,370
Okay, obviously it's not Batman.

1429
01:58:04,130 --> 01:58:05,150
It's not Ravage.

1430
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:13,400
Oh my god, there you go, I got City.

1431
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:16,060
City of Freaks, there you go.

1432
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:17,740
There you go, City of Freaks.

1433
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,000
What?!

1434
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,180
Oh, City of Terror!

1435
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,840
Sorry, City of Terror.

1436
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,520
It felt like...

1437
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:29,080
I mean, to be fair, it is the City of Freaks.

1438
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,260
Here, what is the secret?

1439
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,380
Oh, there's a prisoner in here.

1440
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,160
What is this?

1441
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,180
Wait, they were doing experiments in this area.

1442
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:46,180
Hello?

1443
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:53,970
It won't let me use detective mode.

1444
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:56,150
Oh my god, did I break the game?

1445
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:57,070
Okay, give me a sec.

1446
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:00,010
Alright, I go in.

1447
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:01,310
Oh, there we go.

1448
01:59:01,610 --> 01:59:02,450
Wait, I can't.

1449
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:06,530
It doesn't let me use detective mode.

1450
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:08,990
Oh wait, was this a teaser for the next game?

1451
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,080
It won't let me.

1452
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:17,840
It's for...

1453
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:18,120
Yeah.

1454
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:20,740
I can't zoom in.

1455
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,060
I can't do anything else.

1456
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,160
I don't like looking at that.

1457
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:27,940
I don't like that flashes a lot.

1458
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:34,030
Look around.

1459
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,870
Am I supposed to look?

1460
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:39,990
I see like the the scarecrow bugs right here.

1461
01:59:42,510 --> 01:59:43,330
Oh, right click.

1462
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:44,170
Oh

1463
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:49,030
You fuckers.

1464
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:50,550
You fuckers.

1465
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:50,970
You

1466
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:56,870
Fucking baiters.

1467
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:01,750
Okay, thank you, fuckers.

1468
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:02,910
I'm fucking crazy.

1469
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:07,410
You got him.

1470
02:00:11,110 --> 02:00:12,250
Fucking crazy.

1471
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:18,450
We did it, guys.

1472
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:19,810
We got it.

1473
02:00:22,490 --> 02:00:24,910
This is why you guys don't get free will.

1474
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:27,990
This is another example of why I don't give you free will.

1475
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:31,650
I know you, Erica.

1476
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:34,690
Secure area!

1477
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,630
They don't even know I'm here!

1478
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:41,570
How do I secure an area that they don't know I existed?

1479
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:46,450
Alright, pay that to beat you guys up!

1480
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:52,430
Freedom truly is beautiful.

1481
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:58,120
There you go.

1482
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,420
Oh, that was an accident, but I'll take that.

1483
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:09,000
What the fuck?

1484
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:10,300
I'm trying to...

1485
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:13,300
Alright, we gotta...

1486
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,480
Wait, where is this guy?

1487
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:15,740
There you go.

1488
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,540
We gotta get that guy.

1489
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,020
I like how he's just there.

1490
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:24,900
He's just been... He's just frozen.

1491
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:26,520
Forget.

1492
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:28,900
Oh, there you go.

1493
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:29,700
I unfrozen.

1494
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:33,560
Wait, that's not why I wouldn't.

1495
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,060
Fuck you.

1496
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,580
Let's get you out of here.

1497
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,720
Get you out of this fight.

1498
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:46,110
Look at...

1499
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:47,690
Get you out of here.

1500
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:51,570
Alright, there you go.

1501
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:52,230
You saw that?

1502
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:53,710
All your friends are dead.

1503
02:01:53,970 --> 02:01:54,650
Give me a sec.

1504
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:55,530

It's been weeks since I updated my status.

1507
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:03,250
How are people gonna know what I've felt?

1508
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:12,230
There we go.

1509
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:17,180
Check the door here.

1510
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,480
Knock, knock.

1511
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:23,260
It's me, Batman.

1512
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:26,600
There's nothing to see in here.

That's right.

1559
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:07,110
Get you out of here in this fight.

1560
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:11,510
Oh wait, you have a gun.

1561
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:13,870
Nah, you don't get a gun.

1562
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:18,790
Alright, take him out, too.

1563
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:23,580

You see that combo I did?

1567
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,020
Batter on ice!

1568
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:39,050
Wee!

1569
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:39,870
Oh, shit, wait.

1570
02:05:41,670 --> 02:05:42,690
There we go.

1571
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:45,970
Wee!

1572
02:05:46,490 --> 02:05:49,430
I like this kava.

1573
02:05:50,690 --> 02:05:51,250
Oh, shit.

1574
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:51,890
Wait.

1575
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:54,310
Wee.

1576
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:57,650
And again.

1577
02:05:58,010 --> 02:05:58,430
Oh, wait.

1578
02:05:58,630 --> 02:05:59,650
Yeah, you're not getting that.

1579
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:02,250
Wee.

1580
02:06:05,290 --> 02:06:06,590

Wee.

1582
02:06:09,970 --> 02:06:10,930
That's right.

1583
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,510
For my amusement only.

1584
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:17,090
I wonder if I can actually kill with this.

1585
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:19,350
Is it just stun?

1586
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,810
Yay!

1587
02:06:26,590 --> 02:06:27,270

02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:33,790
He's trying like, where is she?

1589
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:37,910
Is it stun only?

1590
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:38,950
Unlucky.

1591
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:41,670
It's unlucky.

1592
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:48,010
If it's just, I guess if it's just stun only.

1593
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:53,830
I wonder if I can Let's see it.

02:07:57,090 --> 02:07:58,390
It's about the end result.

1616
02:07:58,610 --> 02:08:00,930

Alright, where is he?

1620
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:21,040
Okay, I gotta go back to him.

1621
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:26,240
Don't move, Nora.

1622
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:28,620
I'm gonna inform your husband that you're safe.

1623
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:32,380
There you go.

1624
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:33,700
Try and pop that balloon.

1625
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:37,660
Like, I could have lied to him.

1626
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,060
I could have been, like, yeah, she's safe.

1627
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:40,300
And, like, how would he know?

1628
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,800
How would he know?

1629
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:48,720
Uh, Ale.

1630
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:50,720
Alejandro, thank you for the super chat.

1631
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:51,080
Thank you.

1632
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:51,640
Thank you.

1633
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:52,220
Hola.

1634
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:58,300
What?

1635
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:03,180
I always, like, forget which way I'm supposed to do this.

1636
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:04,920
Oh, my God.

1637
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,220
I have to go that back way.

1638
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:08,940
Can you not unfreeze that for me, bro?

1639
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:10,580
Sorry, I forgot.

1640
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:13,280
He's Mr. Freeze, not Mr. Unfreeze.

1641
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:16,240
I have to go to, like, the other side.

1642
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,420
I have to go to the back door, man.

1643
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:24,720
So annoying.

1644
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:39,880
What?

1645
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:41,600
Oh, I have to do this again?

1646
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:42,800
I'm lucky.

1647
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:46,700
Alright.

1648
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:48,600
Hello, Mr. Freeze.

1649
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:50,700
Found your wife.

1650
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:51,960
She's okay.

1651
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,720
She's still frozen, but she's okay.

1652
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:56,180
I found her freeze.

1653
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:57,480
She's safe.

1654
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:00,560
Nora, where is she?

1655
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:04,960
She was locked up in Warehouse 5B in the Falcone shipping yard.

1656
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,220
She's safe, Victor.

1657
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:07,440
You can go to her.

02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:09,360

1659
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:10,960

And now look who's an idiot for not giving me my fucking medication.

Is that an important one?

1667
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:41,600
What do I get out of this?

1668
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,460
Oh my god.

1669
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:44,800
It's our little beach episode.

1670
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:46,400
We have so many filler.

1671
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:51,870
Start with a close one.

1672
02:11:52,050 --> 02:11:52,790
Alright, I'll do that.

1673
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:54,830
It's like right below me.

1674
02:11:57,670 --> 02:11:58,430
Yeah, it is.

1675
02:11:58,570 --> 02:11:59,210
That's right.

1676
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:00,350
It's me.

1677
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:05,150
What the fuck did I do?

1678
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:08,350

1679
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:12,270

Oh, that's new.

1681
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:22,910
Oh, I broke the combo.

1682
02:12:25,630 --> 02:12:27,310
I broke the combo again.

1683
02:12:27,390 --> 02:12:28,850
Oh, I think it's just a combo, right?

1684
02:12:29,190 --> 02:12:32,790
Every time I do the combo, it gives me like...

1685
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:34,090
new ass moves there.

1686
02:12:34,710 --> 02:12:35,710
Oh, I broke it again.

1687
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:40,860
That's right.

1688
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:44,860
Remember to go to the Wayne Hospital and look for private care.

1689
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:48,460
Here's the card to the nearest hospital.

1690
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:52,560
And remember to request for the Wayne care.

1691
02:12:56,180 --> 02:12:57,660
Alright, let's grab armor.

1692
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:00,880
Uh, we'll do combat.

1693
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:06,520
Here?

1694
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:08,220
I assume it's here.

1695
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:12,700
Remember to request for the Wayne healthcare plan.

1696
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:13,600
Bane?

1697
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:14,960
What?

1698
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:17,660
Bane, you're here?

1699
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:19,700
What are you doing here, Bane?

1700
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:23,420
Oh, this one.

1701
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:27,900
Oh wait, that's the other Bane.

1702
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:32,200
That's before.

1703
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,600
You knew it would not kill me.

1704
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:36,340
I wasn't trying to.

1705
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:38,400
I'm in no mood for a fight.

1706
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:39,600
What are you doing here?

1707
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:41,940
Dr. Young's Titan formula.

1708
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:45,780
I also managed to send some off Arkham Island before you stop.

1709
02:13:45,940 --> 02:13:46,880
Yeah, you skipped Leg Day.

1710
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:47,720
I know.

1711
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:49,860
Penguin had his own Titan guards.

1712
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,300
How much more did Joker send out?

1713
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,460
Too much.

1714
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:55,100
That is why I am here.

1715
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:58,580
I will not allow the Basura of this city to abuse the Titan.

1716
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:01,580
Dr. Young used me to create it.

1717
02:14:01,940 --> 02:14:04,500
It is my duty to destroy what remains.

1718
02:14:05,380 --> 02:14:06,260
Wait, are we...

1719
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:07,240
Are we friends now?

1720
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,100
If you try anything...

1721
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:11,080
Oh my god, best friends forever.

1722
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:12,480
Let's make friendship places.

1723
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:13,480
This, Bane?

1724
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:15,540
I'll forget about the fact you broke my back.

1725
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:17,400
Of course.

1726
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,460
Each container has a radio beacon built in.

1727
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:22,900
There were 12 containers left in this city.

1728
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,360
We take six each.

1729
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,080
Then we meet back here.

1730
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:27,880
I'm ahead of you, Bane.

1731
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,500
You find your six.

1732
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:30,980
I'll take care of what's left.

1733
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:33,120
You've got some catching up to do.

1734
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:36,180
Oh, we're making a little bet here.

1735
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:37,420
Don't make me regret that.

1736
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:43,600
Alright, connecting to the back computer.

1737
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,960
Work with Bane, three Titan containers remaining.

1738
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:48,800
Oh, wait, I did most of them.

1739
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,440
Oh, wait.

1740
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:53,340
That was the one where I was, like, just casually destroyed.

1741
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:54,200
Oh, my God.

1742
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,380
There's one back in the sub.

1743
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:56,040
Oh, my God.

1744
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:57,120
I didn't realize there was one here.

1745
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,920
Okay, that's the entrance for that.

1746
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:01,680
I gotta figure out how to get in there.

1747
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:05,380
Okay, I gotta figure out how to...

1748
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:06,620
I mean, I could technically...

1749
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:07,420
Is that the...

1750
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:08,560
Okay, I could go...

1751
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,700
No, I'll go this way.

1752
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:10,180
All right.

1753
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,280
A good thing I did some of them.

1754
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,140
I'll do this one because there's two over here.

1755
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:20,520
and then we'll just go through that station and then like just find a way across this and then just go left.

1756
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:25,190
What is it?

1757
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:27,290
Are you afraid you will fail?

1758
02:15:28,090 --> 02:15:28,510
All right.

1759
02:15:29,570 --> 02:15:29,970
Jesus, Chris.

1760
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:31,450
At least he's not Absolute Bane.

1761
02:15:31,850 --> 02:15:38,790
Apparently I found out the Absolute series are just like Darksides fan fiction.

1762
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:43,250
You know, it's like how Adventure Time where the Ice King made Fiona and Cake.

1763
02:15:43,770 --> 02:16:15,750
So like the Absolute series is literally just dark-sized little own fan fiction of how he like his own OC's his own like my original character do not steal he's not Batman okay he's absolute Batman it's different he has little fan fiction in prison from Burke to serve his dead father sentence Bane was raised inside a heroic invisions of a Santa Uh,

1764
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:17,130
Priscan prison.

1765
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:21,990
Since the event, remember that beta's turned over and you leave.

1766
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:23,690
Oh my god!

1767
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:28,190
He's like, um, you're out of line, but you are, right?

1768
02:16:29,430 --> 02:16:30,850
Darkside wrote some, so.

1769
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:32,850
Darkside should be a writer, man.

1770
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:37,610
He should be like, uh, Stephanie Myers, when she wrote her fan fiction.

1771
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:40,450
Um, oh my god, what was Twilight based off of again?

1772
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:41,910
Oh, no, that's not Twilight.

1773
02:16:42,390 --> 02:16:43,710
Um, it was, what's your name?

1774
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:45,510
The girl, the lady that...

1775
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:49,610
The author that did the BDSM novel.

1776
02:16:50,090 --> 02:16:51,190
Fuck, it's been so long.

1777
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:53,030
She fell off so hard.

1778
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:55,050
I have 50 Shades of Grey.

1779
02:16:55,450 --> 02:16:55,690
What?

1780
02:16:55,950 --> 02:16:56,370
What?

1781
02:16:56,510 --> 02:16:56,790
No.

1782
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:57,930
No.

1783
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:59,230
It's not feeding time.

1784
02:16:59,410 --> 02:16:59,610
Come on.

1785
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:00,490
No?

1786
02:17:00,690 --> 02:17:01,150
No.

1787
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:03,090
I'm not getting another noise complaint.

1788
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:03,630
No.

1789
02:17:03,970 --> 02:17:09,870
But yeah, 50 Shades of Grey is actually based off of a fan fiction from Twilight.

1790
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:12,010
So Bane should do that, bro.

1791
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:12,870
Not Bane, sorry.

1792
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:13,490
Dark Side.

1793
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:14,570
Bro, you can...

1794
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:15,510
You don't need...

1795
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:21,430
bro you can make your own stories you don't need Batman

1796
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:30,260
I need to turn on aircon in a second

1797
02:17:55,050 --> 02:18:40,780
I have to turn on the aircon I should freeze some of the water water's too hot all right um let's see what was I on talking about before I talked about there oh yeah I was just trying to say yeah you should just he just create his own series but yeah bane is like like um he's like a sponsor now bro he's like in part of alcoholics anonymous he's like like don't worry bro i too was on the hard shit but now but now i'm here to help you look at me i got my one year coin i'm one year sober he says when He's clearly not sober.

1798
02:18:41,340 --> 02:18:46,520
And he's like, guys, don't do Titan.

1799
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:47,760
It ruined my life.

1800
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:49,780
Anyway, hit me up, bro.

1801
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:56,100
Yeah, I don't think he looks clean, guys.

1802
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,220
He definitely does not look clean.

1803
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:04,840
No, no.

1804
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:07,540
I mean, like, wait, actually, I'll go here first.

1805
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:10,940
So now I can go over here and then do this mission.

1806
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:25,020
too right after it's totally natural guys the green stuff you see from my skin i just drank a lot of mountain dew guys that's

1807
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:42,700
really it that's what it is i just happen to drink a lot of mountain dew that's why i'm glowing green i feel like if you're gonna try and like tell people to not do Titan?

1808
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:46,000
You know, you gotta be a good example.

1809
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:52,650
Wee.

1810
02:19:56,670 --> 02:19:59,450
Won't he die if he doesn't take the venom?

1811
02:20:00,330 --> 02:20:00,670
It's alright.

1812
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:03,010
He can just wean it off, you know?

1813
02:20:04,990 --> 02:20:07,050
He's just going through withdrawals.

1814
02:20:07,290 --> 02:20:11,110
It's like how you just start drinking less and less alcohol instead of going full cold turkey.

1815
02:20:11,190 --> 02:20:14,670
It's actually going full cold turkey is really bad for you.

1816
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:16,910
You have to like slowly get off of it.

1817
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:23,830
Like, depending on what you're addicted to, it's actually, like, incredibly bad to go full cold turkey.

1818
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:27,390
But this is, like, a side mission, wasn't it?

1819
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:29,790
I was gonna say, how did I do silent here?

1820
02:20:31,450 --> 02:20:34,350
You can actually die from going full cold turkey.

1821
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:35,850
That's the crazy part.

1822
02:20:36,590 --> 02:20:38,070
That's the- actually- that's the scary part.

1823
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:40,410
You can literally die from doing it.

1824
02:20:41,070 --> 02:20:44,190
Because your body's so used to, like, whatever you're addicted to,

1825
02:20:49,970 --> 02:21:18,810
uh that like it's really bad for your body and the substation the subway station is here great but you saw what it did the joker didn't you he puffed up like some kind of monster yeah but he had to inject it didn't he we're safe just god uh where is it it was here freaking titan crates when the boss sent me out How do I get here,

1826
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:19,330
though?

1827
02:21:21,310 --> 02:21:25,250
I figured out how to get to this one.

1828
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:26,330
It's outside?

1829
02:21:27,390 --> 02:21:28,290
Oh, that is inside.

1830
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:31,950
It looks like it's inside.

1831
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:37,110
It's actually outside?

1832
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:41,470
Brian, thank you for the super chat.

1833
02:21:41,730 --> 02:21:41,850
Thank you.

1834
02:21:42,270 --> 02:21:42,550
Thank you.

1835
02:21:47,890 --> 02:21:48,330
Oh.

1836
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:50,550
Okay.

1837
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:52,270
I guess it's this way.

1838
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:57,910
So, oh my god, this is so confusing.

1839
02:21:58,270 --> 02:21:59,370
So, net maneuver.

1840
02:22:00,910 --> 02:22:02,930
Yeah, it looks like it was inside.

1841
02:22:04,510 --> 02:22:04,990
Is it here?

1842
02:22:06,730 --> 02:22:07,810
Oh, it was here.

1843
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:08,150
Okay.

1844
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:12,850
Alright, I'll just get these guns out of the way.

1845
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:18,190
Alright.

1846
02:22:20,350 --> 02:22:21,810
He's dodging my bat.

1847
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:22,630
They can just do it.

1848
02:22:22,650 --> 02:22:30,150
You can just dodge my banner and I like that?

1849
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:31,270
Fuck you.

1850
02:22:32,470 --> 02:22:33,110
That's right.

1851
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:34,890
Ice smash.

1852
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:38,390
That's for dodging.

1853
02:22:38,670 --> 02:22:41,230
Okay, let me do this and it'll take your goddamn phone call.

1854
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:47,990
Oh, let me tag it again.

1855
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:49,370
The double tag.

1856
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:50,890
There we go.

1857
02:22:52,970 --> 02:22:55,530
Alright, where is his stupid phone call?

1858
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:57,530
God, he's so obsessed with me.

1859
02:22:57,810 --> 02:22:59,930
I have too many villains obsessed with me.

1860
02:23:03,550 --> 02:23:06,230
My phone and answer it quick, Batman.

1861
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:09,710
What if I was in the bathroom, bro?

1862
02:23:10,630 --> 02:23:11,870
I gotta pee.

1863
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:18,510
Oh my god.

1864
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:19,370
Okay, oh, it's here.

1865
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:20,310
Okay, I was gonna sit.

1866
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:26,500
Alright.

1867
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:28,900
Oh, it's one minute.

1868
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:30,400
Oh, this is gonna be tight.

1869
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:31,940
Okay.

1870
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:34,960
One minute's not a lot of time.

1871
02:23:39,150 --> 02:23:41,050
Okay, we're gonna have to...

1872
02:23:43,950 --> 02:23:45,010
I'm gliding!

1873
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:53,190
Not as fast as I would like!

1874
02:23:56,810 --> 02:23:57,790
Oh, there it is.

1875
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:01,510
Alright, I'll take this call.

1876
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:18,760
How many times is he gonna call me?

1877
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:22,700
I feel like the payoff is not gonna be worth it.

1878
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:27,370
He leaned forward and it's gonna be like...

1879
02:24:29,470 --> 02:24:30,210
It's gonna fall out.

1880
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:32,710
What's the word when it falls expectations in the end?

1881
02:24:33,010 --> 02:24:34,370
It'll be very anticlimactic.

1882
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:38,950
This does not feel like it's worth it.

1883
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:46,030
This is why you're an unmemorable Batman villain.

1884
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:53,380
It's why no one remembers you except for the Batman games.

1885
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:04,640
They had Z-list villain.

1886
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:12,920
All right, we gotta go back to doing these.

1887
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:17,780
Wee!

1888
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:21,460
All right, we're ahead across the city now.

1889
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:27,560
Uh, I can't wait for the third, playing the third game when we get the car.

1890
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:30,240
And we can just drive over the villains.

1891
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,920
We can just drive over everywhere.

1892
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:38,960
It'll be a lot faster.

1893
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,300
I never watched the Gotham TV show.

1894
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:44,280
I know it's like...

1895
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,020
Because it was on the CW?

1896
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:46,960
Uh...

1897
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:48,780
The only...

1898
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:50,140
It was on the CW, right?

1899
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:51,040
The Gotham show?

1900
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:54,560
And the only, like, CW show I watched was...

1901
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:55,100
Uh...

1902
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:55,980
Was Supernatural.

1903
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:03,300
Oh, was it on Fox?

1904
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:04,960
Oh, I was thinking about Arrow.

1905
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:05,640
Or...

1906
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:06,720
I was thinking about...

1907
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,680
Aw, I was thinking about...

1908
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:10,320
Uh...

1909
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:11,540
Oh, and Riverdale.

1910
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:12,840
Yeah, and Riverdale.

1911
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,280
I was thinking about the Green Arrow show.

1912
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:21,080
I heard...

1913
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,380
I heard about it.

1914
02:26:31,310 --> 02:26:33,090
Alright, we gotta find the other Titan.

1915
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:36,630
Thank God I did those three earlier.

1916
02:26:39,010 --> 02:26:44,130
Bane's sponsor, Amy, sounds like a plotline from Harley Quinn.

1917
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:48,550
I would say Harley Quinn Bane is my favorite Bane.

1918
02:26:49,470 --> 02:26:50,990
Out of all the Bane iteration.

1919
02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:52,630
He's just, I don't know.

1920
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:55,450
For me, he's like, he's like the most Bane.

1921
02:26:55,590 --> 02:27:00,830
I know, he might not be the most Bane for you guys, but for me he's the best Bane they've ever made.

1922
02:27:01,650 --> 02:27:03,970
He's so, he's so fucking stupid.

1923
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:05,930
That's stupid.

1924
02:27:07,650 --> 02:27:12,550
I feel like the first, literally I'm only watching Harley Quinn for Bane.

1925
02:27:13,610 --> 02:27:16,690
Because the newest seasons of Harley Quinn is so fucking bad.

1926
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:20,010
But the...

1927
02:27:20,010 --> 02:27:22,870
But like, Bane makes it all watchable for me.

1928
02:27:29,990 --> 02:27:30,610
Jesus, bro.

1929
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:37,750
Where is it?

1930
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:39,910
Yeah, he's actually the best character in the show.

1931
02:27:40,890 --> 02:27:42,010
But where is this?

1932
02:27:43,010 --> 02:27:44,030
It's like here.

1933
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:44,890
Oh, there it is.

1934
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:45,930
It's not toxic.

1935
02:27:46,070 --> 02:27:47,690
Is it or radioactive or whatever?

1936
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:49,630
Goodbye.

1937
02:27:53,170 --> 02:27:53,610
Alright.

1938
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:57,150
Oh, I didn't want to smash you, but that's fine.

1939
02:27:59,570 --> 02:28:02,310
Okay, the ice gadget is so useful, not gonna lie.

1940
02:28:04,350 --> 02:28:04,790
Mm-hmm.

1941
02:28:05,230 --> 02:28:06,350
How do I kill you?

1942
02:28:06,350 --> 02:28:07,150
Oh, I'll just do this.

1943
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:08,470
This is the easiest.

1944
02:28:09,970 --> 02:28:10,930
It's the fastest.

1945
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:13,830
So how would I put you in the hospital?

1946
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:22,040
Cool, guys, don't look at explosions.

1947
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:24,100
Boom.

1948
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:25,820
Wait, did it work?

1949
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:26,680
Yeah, it did.

1950
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:29,260
Alright, one Titan container left.

1951
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:30,520
How do I get in here, actually?

1952
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:32,980
A steel mill.

1953
02:28:34,980 --> 02:28:36,620
How do I get in the steel mill?

1954
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:40,280
Here?

1955
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,000
Where's the door at?

1956
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:52,660
What the fuck is that door?

1957
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:54,560
Oh, there.

1958
02:28:55,500 --> 02:28:55,800
Oh, there.

1959
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:58,240
Joko make me his right-hand guy when I drag that point here.

1960
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:04,840
Who said that?

1961
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:09,320
You think you're the one That's gonna kill Batman?

1962
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:10,860
Really?

1963
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:13,340
You, goon number five.

1964
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:17,160
You're gonna be the one That's gonna stop it all.

1965
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:18,960
Really, you.

1966
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:24,520
That's cute, buddy.

1967
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,060
That's so cute.

1968
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:27,700
Wee!

1969
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:31,540
There we go.

1970
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:59,840

1971
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:04,940

1972
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:07,180
Oh my god, got it.

1973
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:08,900
That's crazy.

1974
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:13,920
Kappa, that madman.

1975
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:15,820
He covered the door.

1976
02:30:19,960 --> 02:30:21,920
Alright, let's get this guy out of here.

1977
02:30:29,240 --> 02:30:29,920
Whee!

1978
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:35,540
Alright.

1979
02:30:37,140 --> 02:30:40,440
Joker go number 5-1.

1980
02:30:42,090 --> 02:30:45,440
He actually did it, that madman.

1981
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:54,780
Yeah?

1982
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:59,720
Did you do it?

1983
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:02,200
Yeah?

1984
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:05,100
There we go.

1985
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:06,320
Oh shit!

1986
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,900
I still have my nades!

1987
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:11,660
That's right.

1988
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:16,530
We got high now.

1989
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:19,530
I don't know where the door is anymore.

1990
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:21,310
Oh wait, there he is.

1991
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:22,070
There he is.

1992
02:31:22,150 --> 02:31:22,970
They covered the door.

1993
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:26,050
They're still covering, guys.

1994
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,990
Oh shit.

1995
02:31:31,150 --> 02:31:32,270
Oh shit, I'm one.

1996
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:36,650
He's still covering the door, though.

1997
02:31:39,310 --> 02:31:40,330
He's still doing it.

1998
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:45,340
There we go.

1999
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:49,180
That's right.

2000
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:50,420
No more doors.

2001
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:55,540
Don't let him cover up the doors again.

2002
02:31:55,900 --> 02:32:00,520
Oh, see, thank you for the super chat.

2003
02:32:00,700 --> 02:32:01,560
Thank you, thank you.

2004
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,800
I went to SDCC this year to promote a Gotham show.

2005
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:06,480
They had high zip line across the city.

2006
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:08,260
Oh, that's so cool.

2007
02:32:09,580 --> 02:32:10,580
A copy of the new...

2008
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:12,000
That's like good memorabilia, too.

2009
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:19,460
Also, JP, uh, thank you for, welcome to the command farm.

2010
02:32:19,780 --> 02:32:20,340
Welcome, welcome.

2011
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:25,300
Remember as a hero, goal number five, when you covered that door.

2012
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:27,420
Oh, now they teach me this move.

2013
02:32:27,660 --> 02:32:29,060
I'm sorry, brazo.

2014
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:30,540
I can't come to the...

2015
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:31,160
Oh, shit!

2016
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:34,680
I'm trying to announce something called secret from Mr. J.

2017
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:36,640
So I can't find you what it is.

2018
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:44,080
Or, I'm keeping the seal now for your best confrontation.

2019
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:48,100
Bro, I was just wanting to listen to the lore.

2020
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:53,400
I was just trying to listen to the lore, man.

2021
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:55,880
I was supposed to know it would...

2022
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:56,980
They would know I'm here.

2023
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,180
Also, I mean, welcome to Tomato Farm.

2024
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:01,100
Welcome, welcome.

2025
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:04,980
There you go.

2026
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:08,400
Remember to go to the Wayne Private Hospital.

2027
02:33:13,960 --> 02:33:14,960
Alright, let's see.

2028
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:17,280
We need the ice for this.

2029
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:18,400
also.

2030
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:19,420
Holy shit!

2031
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:19,780
Wait.

2032
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:21,240
It's like back... Wait.

2033
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:22,280
It's back here.

2034
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:25,900
The Titans is over there.

2035
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:26,180
Yeah.

2036
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:27,880
I didn't see... I just missed the Titan.

2037
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:29,920
Oh, wait.

2038
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:30,820
Not the back, though.

2039
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:32,540
Uh, got all the Titan.

2040
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,720
The Bane's gonna be so proud of me.

2041
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:40,160
Now that all the Titan containers are destroyed, I should go back to Bane and see how he's doing.

2042
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:43,960
Alright, we'll do that later.

2043
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,980
Oh, we gotta...

2044
02:33:48,100 --> 02:35:18,840
and then what oh whoops I just heard from my dad he's been summoned to City Hall strange is requesting that emergency protocol 10 is activated what does the emergency 10 is I forgot to do a security measure strange told the High Council he had failed to stem the use of illegal weapons within the prison weapons he this was his plan all along it certainly looks that way I can wait I don't actually have to pull it I'm patient enough like I just have to go here right I'll just wait hello okay i was gonna say if i not can i not climb this i don't know it's not that fast not gonna lie okay now it gets a little scary now i can see why i have to pull it yeah i have to pull it here i mean i can see now I don't know why I had to do it.

2045
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:20,920
But other than that, it's not, like, too threatening.

2046
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:28,940
Alright, I can wait.

2047
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:33,660
Did you see the Joker just now?

2048
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,860
Yeah, he looked okay, didn't he?

2049
02:35:35,940 --> 02:35:36,700
Open sesame!

2050
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:41,320
How the hell did that happen?

2051
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:42,220
Today?

2052
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:43,700
Well, good.

2053
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:46,060
So, did he find the cure or what?

2054
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:47,520
Did he do it?

2055
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:49,920
The last thing I heard was the doctors couldn't save him.

2056
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:53,500
Quinn even had me torture some lady doctor to find a cure.

2057
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:55,520
That's not cool.

2058
02:35:55,860 --> 02:36:10,720
Torch is not cool only when I do it though, because I'm a good person Well, who cares he's back the Joker's back Well, he's alive.

2059
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:15,140
I'll say that He's not really there.

2060
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:21,460
He's he's alive We still Okay

2061
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:28,420
Wait, we can't have that.

2062
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:30,660
That's fucking right.

2063
02:36:32,340 --> 02:36:33,560
We can't have you get the guns.

2064
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:34,680
Get out of here.

2065
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:41,880
Wait, I was trying to get you.

2066
02:36:45,850 --> 02:36:47,010
Get your ass out of here.

2067
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:48,210
No guns.

2068
02:36:49,130 --> 02:36:51,310
If I can't shoot, you can't shoot out of here.

2069
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,520
That's right.

2070
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:58,280
You ain't killing nobody.

2071
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:01,360
Wait, we gotta get that.

2072
02:37:01,380 --> 02:37:02,140
this guy out here.

2073
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:09,000
Oh.

2074
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:10,680
We gotta do a beat down, I guess.

2075
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:13,200
Oh, shit.

2076
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:15,660
There you go.

2077
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:17,260
No gun for you!

2078
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:19,040
Oh, no.

2079
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:23,520
I'm trying to do a beat down, but, like, everyone else is not letting me.

2080
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:27,140
I would love to do a beat down on you right now, bro.

2081
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:29,440
Okay.

2082
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:33,840
There you go.

2083
02:37:34,360 --> 02:37:34,960
There's my beat down.

2084
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:35,460
down.

2085
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:38,340
Your turn!

2086
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:42,700
No guns allowed!

2087
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:46,980
Only I get to use gadgets.

2088
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:49,820
I'm Batman.

2089
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:54,580
As you can see, I'm looking much better.

2090
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:58,720
In fact, ooh, I think I'm looking better than ever.

2091
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:01,280
It's crazy what makeup can do.

2092
02:38:04,980 --> 02:38:06,880
Look, look, be up your surgeon.

2093
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:09,760
Now, well, here's the thing.

2094
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:12,960
Answers don't give you everlasting satisfaction.

2095
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:16,500
Sometimes you need to brace yourself for disappointment.

2096
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:17,880
Now, think about it.

2097
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:20,060
Imagine your favorite TV show.

2098
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:21,920
You've been through it all.

2099
02:38:22,060 --> 02:38:26,920
The ups, the downs, the crazy coincidences, and then bang.

2100
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:29,700
They tell you what it's all about.

2101
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:31,780
Would you be happy?

2102
02:38:32,380 --> 02:38:33,460
Does it make sense?

2103
02:38:34,980 --> 02:39:07,280
wait is Batman the one is joke that's not the real Joker right it's a double and Joker's the one that's filming no hostage yeah no surrender I know it sounds like suicide but listen whatever happens I'll be right behind you I don't think that's the real Joker that's I don't think that's the real Joker.

2104
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,720
There's no way.

2105
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:13,000
Oh yeah, this is definitely Harley Quinn's office.

2106
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:13,900
There's no way.

2107
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:15,520
Like, you can't just get better.

2108
02:39:15,820 --> 02:39:16,380
Like, what the fuck?

2109
02:39:18,660 --> 02:39:22,260
Did he get, like, a plastic surgeon too?

2110
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:23,360
It's like, what's his name?

2111
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:25,920
Chris, uh, what was her name?

2112
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:26,560
Courtney?

2113
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:27,280
I don't know.

2114
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:31,780
The, the, the, oh my God, what was it?

2115
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:32,900
The Kardashians.

2116
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:34,620
Kim Kardashian's mom?

2117
02:39:34,980 --> 02:40:07,240
like she had like a crazy insane plastic surgery recently where she looks like she's 50 instead of like i don't know 70 or like the special filter oh yeah did you guys see that tweet of this um of some guy in china made like the fucking e-girl filter wait i gotta show you guys this actually reminded me i saw this on twitter i was like holy shit like take the crazy ass filters now that The filters that exist today is insane.

2118
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:09,500
Like, it actually literally changes your gender.

2119
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:11,820
I'm pretty sure I saved it.

2120
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:13,980
Because I was like...

2121
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:15,400
Alright.

2122
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:19,400
Alright.

2123
02:40:19,540 --> 02:40:22,640
Oh, apparently it's not in real time.

2124
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:28,120
But even if it's not in real time and they did this via post, that's so crazy.

2125
02:40:28,580 --> 02:40:28,860
Yeah.

2126
02:40:29,420 --> 02:40:32,780
Someone did a community note and said, oh, this isn't in real time.

2127
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:36,480
It takes, like, roughly one minute to generate the clip.

2128
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:43,700
But even the fact, even if it takes one minute for like a five second clip, that's still really good time.

2129
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:53,540
Because if they can do that now, if they can, even though it takes time to generate this, eventually they can only do it.

2130
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:54,760
They can do it real time.

2131
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:55,680
It's getting there.

2132
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Yeah.

2133
02:40:56,340 --> 02:40:58,280
Eventually it'll be real time.

2134
02:40:58,700 --> 02:41:03,260
Because the fact is just basically trying to like fine tune it until it's real time.

2135
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:04,540
That's insane.

2136
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:06,380
That's actually insane.

2137
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:08,820
The filter goes fucking hard.

2138
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:11,780
And new girls weren't real.

2139
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:14,760
The first step is VTubers.

2140
02:41:15,220 --> 02:41:17,260
The second step is flesh.

2141
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:24,820
You can't wait to catfish the homies.

2142
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:25,760
And since...

2143
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:28,760
Because eventually, eventually, it'll be real time.

2144
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:30,000
You're right.

2145
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:30,980
Just add delay.

2146
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:33,780
Just add a five minute delay on OBS.

2147
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:34,880
You're so right.

2148
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:44,400
eventually all right

2149
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:53,280
that's right the stream is there's a five minute delay on stream so i can get my filters to work

2150
02:41:56,440 --> 02:42:10,440
let me explain to you what's going on the joker is winning you and your boss are losing now we want the joker to keep winning So you're gonna tell us everything we need to know about Two-Face's plans.

2151
02:42:10,820 --> 02:42:12,220
You probably don't want to.

2152
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:13,020
I get that.

2153
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:15,560
So we're gonna have to convince you.

2154
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,820
Screw you!

2155
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:19,040
Wait, whose boss is that?

2156
02:42:19,300 --> 02:42:20,280
Whose goon is that?

2157
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:25,340
I don't know who's goon this is.

2158
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:26,400
You can still hear me, right?

2159
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:27,860
Two-Face.

2160
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:28,740
Oh, it's Two-Face!

2161
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:29,600
He's black and white.

2162
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:31,760
Alright, give me a sec.

2163
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:32,900
Apparently...

2164
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:33,940
I'm gonna drop you.

2165
02:42:33,940 --> 02:42:35,080
I have to beat up the heart.

2166
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:35,440
Yeah.

2167
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:37,920
The Harley bots.

2168
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:39,180
I forgot about that.

2169
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:44,700
I didn't hear this first sentence.

2170
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:47,340
He started melting before he even touched the hot stuff.

2171
02:42:48,820 --> 02:42:50,460
You ever smelled melting flesh?

2172
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:51,960
No, no.

2173
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:53,440
Most people haven't.

2174
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:55,040
Let me paint you a picture.

2175
02:42:55,780 --> 02:43:00,000
First, it smells like meat on a barbecue.

2176
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:05,240
You know, burning skin, fat, meat.

2177
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:06,800
Then...

2178
02:43:06,820 --> 02:43:09,240
It reaches the bones.

2179
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:11,640
That's the nasty bit.

2180
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:14,740
Maybe he's immune to acid.

2181
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:15,680
Like Joker.

2182
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:17,720
I guess it was all kind of...

2183
02:43:17,720 --> 02:43:18,340
It could happen.

2184
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:22,200
Because he screamed pretty much up to the point.

2185
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,080
It's like a 1%.

2186
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:24,440
He could be the 1%.

2187
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:24,900
Who cares?

2188
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:27,860
You're gonna tell us what Two-Face is up to.

2189
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:28,900
Right?

2190
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:32,000
Oh, okay.

2191
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:34,400
To be fair, this seems like Goon number 240.

2192
02:43:34,740 --> 02:43:36,580
I feel like Two-Face would not tell him anything.

2193
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:41,730
Oh shit, I'm supposed to save him!

2194
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:46,570
Um...

2195
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:48,220
Oh my god, I did it.

2196
02:43:49,060 --> 02:43:49,470
I...

2197
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:51,400
I'm a hero!

2198
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:55,980
I forgot to...

2199
02:43:57,880 --> 02:44:00,680
Imagine if I didn't save him?

2200
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:04,460
That was a close call.

2201
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:36,710
you were so yeah yeah it was that would have been so awkward I'm a hero he almost died it's but I'm a hero wait I'll be back I gotta I gotta deal with the heart of the actually I don't know if he despawns if I don't come back how do I destroy these again

2202
02:44:39,790 --> 02:44:41,290
How do I destroy these?

2203
02:44:42,670 --> 02:44:43,310
Oh, this.

2204
02:44:43,790 --> 02:44:44,790
There you go.

2205
02:44:52,460 --> 02:44:53,640
I saved your life.

2206
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:02,780
Oh, it is a turf war.

2207
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:03,840
That's it?

2208
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,120
Okay.

2209
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:06,800
I don't get anything out of it.

2210
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:10,480
Anyway, I gotta destroy the other one first, too.

2211
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:12,080
There you go.

2212
02:45:16,150 --> 02:45:16,930
What?

2213
02:45:17,330 --> 02:45:17,830
What?

2214
02:45:19,850 --> 02:45:21,190
What happened?

2215
02:45:21,990 --> 02:45:23,210
I thought we cool!

2216
02:45:23,750 --> 02:45:24,130
I thought

2217
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:30,660
we...

2218
02:45:30,660 --> 02:45:31,720
For a second!

2219
02:45:31,960 --> 02:45:34,060
I quit boiling in water.

2220
02:45:35,720 --> 02:45:36,280
Okay, good.

2221
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,780
God, unappreciative.

2222
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:40,730
Talk about ungrateful.

2223
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:42,460
So ungrateful.

2224
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:43,880
Yeah, get out of here.

2225
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:46,780
Sure, let them boil you.

2226
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,260
He flipped the coin.

2227
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:52,860
Bro fucking flipped the coin.

2228
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:58,480
Don't be naive.

2229
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:03,560
Yeah, the coin was... he flipped heads.

2230
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:06,760
Get out of here.

2231
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:10,620
Why is there... is this a puzzle?

2232
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:11,800
I swear to God.

2233
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:13,800
Okay, it's this.

2234
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:14,700
I knew it.

2235
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:20,340
Wait, a two-face gun is two-face.

2236
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:22,360
saying it ain't so.

2237
02:46:23,980 --> 02:46:25,160
Yeah, where am I supposed to go?

2238
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:38,300
Alright.

2239
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:45,840
That'll work.

2240
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:47,860
Don't worry, I'll get there eventually.

2241
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:51,400
Slow and steady.

2242
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:53,880
Okay.

2243
02:46:58,970 --> 02:47:01,270
You have to do this, I guess.

2244
02:47:03,970 --> 02:47:04,430
What?

2245
02:47:07,210 --> 02:47:08,130
There we go.

2246
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:12,560
I'm pulling!

2247
02:47:14,460 --> 02:47:16,840
Oh my god, this is taking so long.

2248
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:19,460
The ledge is literally blocking me.

2249
02:47:19,460 --> 02:47:21,140
I've hacked into the council CCTV.

2250
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:23,360
The council members are coming back.

2251
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:24,700
They don't look happy.

2252
02:47:25,940 --> 02:47:27,940
Are they ever happy though?

2253
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:31,240
That they never believed Protocol 10 would need to be activated.

2254
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:34,740
But they gave him permission, didn't they?

2255
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:37,580
Am I slowly heading over?

2256
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:39,980
All 10 will commence in 30 minutes.

2257
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:43,380
You all have specific orders for this situation.

2258
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:44,320
Follow them.

2259
02:47:45,140 --> 02:47:46,260
Do you still need an answer?

2260
02:47:47,060 --> 02:47:48,280
Bruce, I don't like this.

2261
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,200
Be careful.

2262
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,520
How do I get to the other side?

2263
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:53,860
There's no thing to pull.

2264
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,440
Yeah, I'm stuck.

2265
02:48:03,100 --> 02:48:03,960
Oh, is it lying?

2266
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:04,860
Oh, it is the...

2267
02:48:04,860 --> 02:48:07,160
Okay, I was going to say, am I supposed to line launch you this?

2268
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:09,220
Yeah.

2269
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:13,720
That's right.

2270
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:14,820
Kitten aided.

2271
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,020
Yeah, I was gonna say, what the fuck?

2272
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:22,740
Where am I supposed to go now?

2273
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:29,740
Flow and steady.

2274
02:48:33,860 --> 02:48:35,340
Oh my god, it's a bat.

2275
02:48:35,460 --> 02:48:36,480
Oh my god.

2276
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:36,820
Okay.

2277
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:39,160
Alright, it's batter-on time.

2278
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:41,640
I practice for this.

2279
02:48:43,460 --> 02:48:44,320
Okay, wait.

2280
02:48:49,650 --> 02:48:50,610
I matched.

2281
02:48:50,670 --> 02:48:51,430
I should have inverted.

2282
02:48:51,570 --> 02:48:52,690
I still forgot to invert.

2283
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:54,270
U-turn!

2284
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:55,870
U-turn!

2285
02:48:57,590 --> 02:48:59,050
Okay, it's right here.

2286
02:48:59,630 --> 02:49:00,570
There's the hole.

2287
02:49:02,010 --> 02:49:04,730
I'm still on inverted controls, but that's okay.

2288
02:49:10,340 --> 02:49:11,740
Okay, let's...

2289
02:49:11,740 --> 02:49:12,640
Um...

2290
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:14,040
Okay.

2291
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:17,340
There you go.

2292
02:49:17,900 --> 02:49:18,680
Alright, here you go.

2293
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:19,960
Now...

2294
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:20,880
should be fine.

2295
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:23,280
It's so much.

2296
02:49:23,500 --> 02:49:23,960
Who would have?

2297
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:24,440
Okay.

2298
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:26,480
But like, what is in...

2299
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:26,960
Who is...

2300
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:27,180
Okay.

2301
02:49:27,280 --> 02:49:28,000
I need to know.

2302
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:29,240
Like...

2303
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:30,940
Oh my god.

2304
02:49:31,280 --> 02:49:31,980
I need to know.

2305
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:33,140
Like, who is it for?

2306
02:49:33,380 --> 02:49:34,280
Inverted controls.

2307
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:37,540
What kind of sick fuck is like into that?

2308
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:42,840
A batterang will hold enough charge to overload the...

2309
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:45,220
Oh, I forgot to fucking electrocute it.

2310
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:54,980
There you go.

2311
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:57,000
For real.

2312
02:49:58,240 --> 02:49:58,860
Realism.

2313
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:01,640
Flight sim enthusiast.

2314
02:50:08,030 --> 02:50:11,820
I hate to break it to you, but not all of you are going to be pilots.

2315
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:23,270
Wrong.

2316
02:50:25,570 --> 02:50:27,790
Yeah, where are you going to fly a plane?

2317
02:50:31,210 --> 02:50:33,430
Don't crush their dreams.

2318
02:50:34,250 --> 02:50:35,510
There's a pilot short.

2319
02:50:35,550 --> 02:50:36,710
I wonder why.

2320
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:39,330
I wonder why there's a pilot short.

2321
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:40,550
shortage right now.

2322
02:50:44,310 --> 02:50:48,630
And they ain't looking too good in the flying community.

2323
02:50:55,390 --> 02:50:56,530
And you'll never be bad.

2324
02:50:56,770 --> 02:50:59,650
Because I played video games to escape reality.

2325
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:04,210
It's not like I actually want to be Batman.

2326
02:51:10,540 --> 02:51:11,100
Let's see.

2327
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:15,420
Oh, wait.

2328
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:16,260
This is a shortcut.

2329
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:18,220
Wait, what?

2330
02:51:18,500 --> 02:51:19,600
Oh, it's here.

2331
02:51:26,830 --> 02:51:29,590
I came from... Wait, which... Where did I come from here?

2332
02:51:29,790 --> 02:51:30,050
Yeah.

2333
02:51:33,230 --> 02:51:33,670
Alright.

2334
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:38,470
And we're literally Batman.

2335
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:43,630
I don't know what this is for, but I guess I'll do it.

2336
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:50,440
What is this for?

2337
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:52,600
What?

2338
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:02,150
I don't understand.

2339
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:21,000
Like, I see a hostile, but I don't understand what it's for, though.

2340
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:24,160
Oh, it's for a trophy?

2341
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:26,740
What the fuck?

2342
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:31,540
It's all right.

2343
02:52:31,820 --> 02:52:32,280
You're safe.

2344
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:33,460
You're lucky.

2345
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:35,580
Oh, it's... I forgot I was here before.

2346
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:36,900
Believe me, Doctor.

2347
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:39,360
Yeah, you're not killing this armor.

2348
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:41,120
This armor was, like, $5 million.

2349
02:52:41,660 --> 02:52:42,040
What's been happening?

2350
02:52:42,380 --> 02:52:43,300
I did what you said.

2351
02:52:43,840 --> 02:53:12,850

Okay, it's still hitting me, okay, that's cool No, I didn't Oh, where am I?

Oh my god, he has a shotgun.

2358
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:45,680
Guys, I'm...

2359
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:50,760
Guys, it ain't looking so good for me.

2360
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:57,620
It's not looking so good for me, guys.

2361
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:01,960
Stub!

2362
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:04,440
Oh, wait.

2363
02:55:11,020 --> 02:55:15,040
I tried just again.

2364
02:55:15,280 --> 02:55:18,000
Okay, I'll actually stub the stab.

2365
02:55:18,820 --> 02:55:22,020
Yeah, I was, I think, I think he got me.

2366
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:22,300
Like...

2367
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:23,000
That's what he said.

2368
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:25,160
Man, you should have seen his face.

2369
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:26,860
The point blank.

2370
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:29,100
That thugs armed with proximity mines.

2371
02:55:29,720 --> 02:55:31,340
Bro, what the- that is not safe.

2372
02:55:31,640 --> 02:55:32,000
Look at me.

2373
02:55:32,140 --> 02:55:32,820
I'm gorgeous.

2374
02:55:33,300 --> 02:55:34,900
So what's the deal with Jay?

2375
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:36,780
That does not look safe.

2376
02:55:36,960 --> 02:55:37,800
It's a freaking miracle.

2377
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:39,580
Yesterday looked like crap.

2378
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:40,020
Today?

2379
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:41,940
The real Joker's back.

2380
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:43,560
Thank God.

2381
02:55:43,660 --> 02:55:47,220
Yeah, I don't think that's- I think it's a double ganging.

2382
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:52,220
What is he doing?

2383
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,120
Okay, my dear.

2384
02:55:56,720 --> 02:55:58,980
Why don't you go and fight Batman?

2385
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:02,600
Can I do this?

2386
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:04,680
No, he's not under me.

2387
02:56:05,560 --> 02:56:07,740
What do I stealth this?

2388
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:08,880
What the fuck?

2389
02:56:12,390 --> 02:56:15,790
I'm trying to figure out how to stealth this, but I don't know.

2390
02:56:15,870 --> 02:56:16,950
It doesn't look too good.

2391
02:56:22,740 --> 02:57:06,400
joke will make me his right-hand guy when I drag that pointy and freak through the boss no this is this this is not look stealthable I think I there's only one thing I can do the boss wants this place kept safe no problem I can tell you it absolutely is not the dokiway That's for sure I could tell you it's not via the dokiway

2392
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:18,340
I'm stuck in arkham city and joker still telling me what to do nothing changes

2393
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:39,500
Oops Silent takedown Dokey smash.

2394
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:41,700
So silent.

2395
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:44,900
Oh.

2396
02:57:46,380 --> 02:57:47,340
Oh, shit.

2397
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:48,280
Oh, shit.

2398
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:49,300
Oh, shit.

2399
02:57:49,580 --> 02:57:50,180
Give me a sec.

2400
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:52,280
Let me open this vent real quick.

2401
02:57:59,050 --> 02:58:00,030
No, I'm not.

2402
02:58:01,510 --> 02:58:03,670
Guys, there's a lot of people with guns here.

2403
02:58:05,530 --> 02:58:06,970
You think they know?

2404
02:58:07,910 --> 02:58:09,430
Who's actually telling the truth?

2405
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:10,430
The mind's...

2406
02:58:10,450 --> 02:58:11,450
Don't blow us up.

2407
02:58:14,940 --> 02:58:15,380
Silent!

2408
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:22,640
They walked away.

2409
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:23,800
It's not my fault.

2410
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:35,580
Did he get up?

2411
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:36,980
Wait, I could just bait him in here.

2412
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,460
Yeah, I'm right here.

2413
02:58:44,690 --> 02:58:46,070
Wait, I just need him to turn around.

2414
02:58:49,310 --> 02:58:50,930
Wait, as soon as they turn around.

2415
02:58:51,230 --> 02:58:52,510
He's making us look stupid.

2416
02:58:52,550 --> 02:58:53,770
Watch this.

2417
02:58:54,310 --> 02:58:55,190
Shut the hell up.

2418
02:58:55,450 --> 02:58:57,390
We need to keep looking or we're all dead.

2419
02:58:58,090 --> 02:58:59,070
Show yourself, chicken.

2420
02:58:59,310 --> 02:59:00,510
Yeah, show yourself.

2421
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:05,280
Oh, shit.

2422
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:06,180
Oh, shit.

2423
02:59:06,460 --> 02:59:07,140
Oh, shit.

2424
02:59:07,980 --> 02:59:08,540
Serpentine.

2425
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,120
Get closer.

2426
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:12,940
Yeah, watch this, bro.

2427
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:14,840
Oh, what the fuck?

2428
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:18,740
He's trying to smoke me out like a rat.

2429
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:21,620
Oh, yeah.

2430
02:59:24,900 --> 02:59:25,420

2431
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:26,800
Seals!

2432
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:27,820
You do?

2433
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:29,760
I may have to drop you.

2434
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:32,680
Seals!

2435
02:59:36,860 --> 02:59:38,740
Yeah, it's over here.

2436
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:40,000
Where did he go?

2437
02:59:44,540 --> 02:59:46,600
Where did he go, guys?

2438
02:59:48,460 --> 02:59:49,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2439
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:50,880
Yeah, I'm right here.

2440
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:52,740
Yeah, you want to come over here.

2441
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:53,680
Yeah, that's right.

2442
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:03,840

2443
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:13,300

03:00:17,520 --> 03:01:02,900

2445
03:01:10,370 --> 03:01:11,590
I hear you, buddy.

2446
03:01:13,330 --> 03:01:14,530
We don't.

2447
03:01:15,050 --> 03:01:16,690
I'm in your walls.

2448
03:01:18,950 --> 03:01:20,490
How do I get out of here?

2449
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:25,820
Wait, what?

2450
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:27,240
What the fuck is this bed for?

2451
03:01:28,540 --> 03:01:29,680
Oh, it's for nothing.

2452
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:32,820
I thought I could do something with this bed.

2453
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:34,500
I just...

2454
03:01:41,950 --> 03:01:42,750
Oh, wait.

2455
03:01:43,390 --> 03:01:43,830
Oh, bot.

2456
03:01:45,730 --> 03:01:46,250
Can I?

2457
03:01:51,530 --> 03:01:53,290
Is there actually something there?

2458
03:01:54,810 --> 03:01:56,670
Yeah, I was going to say, that's not how I sleep before.

2459
03:01:57,170 --> 03:01:58,810
But yeah, that's not going to lead me anywhere.

2460
03:02:00,330 --> 03:02:02,430
All right, I'm trying to figure out how to get out of here, though.

2461
03:02:03,210 --> 03:02:04,230
Oh, like here, maybe?

2462
03:02:04,290 --> 03:02:05,570
Is there another exit here?

2463
03:02:08,430 --> 03:02:10,750
I think you saw me poking my head up.

2464
03:02:11,050 --> 03:02:12,310
Nah.

2465
03:02:17,110 --> 03:02:18,410
Oh, what the fuck?

2466
03:02:19,950 --> 03:02:20,150
Oh.

2467
03:02:26,520 --> 03:02:28,140
No, it's not.

2468
03:02:29,640 --> 03:02:31,280
You're just seeing things.

2469
03:02:31,480 --> 03:02:32,440
I'm in a box.

2470
03:02:35,860 --> 03:02:36,520
Stupid.

2471
03:02:38,420 --> 03:02:40,000
Oh, shit!

2472
03:02:40,640 --> 03:02:41,200
Smoke!

2473
03:02:47,480 --> 03:02:48,440
Stealth!

2474
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:51,780
I did not see the fucking mine.

2475
03:02:52,980 --> 03:02:53,860
That's smart.

2476
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:55,340
That was a smart sniper.

2477
03:02:57,900 --> 03:02:58,980
How are they?

2478
03:03:00,780 --> 03:03:03,160
This is a trap, isn't it?

2479
03:03:12,990 --> 03:03:14,970
This feels like a trap.

2480
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:25,760
Oh, yeah, no, you're not stupid enough for this.

2481
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:26,560
You have a PhD.

2482
03:03:27,820 --> 03:03:28,040
Alright.

2483
03:03:28,940 --> 03:03:30,040
Enough talking.

2484
03:03:30,740 --> 03:03:30,900
Wait.

2485
03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:32,860
You can talk.

2486
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:36,140
Or...

2487
03:03:36,140 --> 03:03:36,600
Nope.

2488
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:55,940

2490
03:04:10,690 --> 03:04:12,970
Do I just keep going this way?

2491
03:04:13,330 --> 03:04:14,810
Is this through the waste exchange?

2492
03:04:19,150 --> 03:04:21,890
Yeah, this fist is rated E for everyone.

2493
03:04:22,050 --> 03:04:23,270
I don't even know how to get this.

2494
03:04:26,050 --> 03:04:27,670
Maybe another entrance, maybe.

2495
03:04:33,620 --> 03:04:34,040
I don't know.

2496
03:04:34,380 --> 03:04:35,080
I'll keep it.

2497
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:36,760
Actually, yeah.

2498
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:41,340
Wait, does she say anything new?

2499
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:47,920
That's some strong-ass lipstick.

2500
03:04:47,960 --> 03:04:48,940
Stop doing that.

2501
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:50,520
I'm going to tell Mr. Jack.

2502
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:51,140
He's going to what?

2503
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:52,580
He's sick.

2504
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:54,380
Well, he's going to be sick.

2505
03:04:55,320 --> 03:04:56,660
Don't you dare.

2506
03:04:56,900 --> 03:04:58,620
Look, I'm doing dialogue option.

2507
03:05:03,380 --> 03:05:03,880
What are you?

2508
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:04,520
Alright.

2509
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:07,240
That's strong-ass lipstick, girl.

2510
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:08,460
Where did you get that?

2511
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:12,000
Go this way.

2512
03:05:12,140 --> 03:05:12,840
I think I go this way.

2513
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:23,620
I guess this way.

2514
03:05:28,850 --> 03:05:31,030
Gova, thank you a 20 gift and ships.

2515
03:05:31,330 --> 03:05:31,450

Thank you.

2522
03:05:41,670 --> 03:05:42,710
Oh, there's the hack.

2523
03:05:42,990 --> 03:05:44,270
I can hack this now.

2524
03:05:45,070 --> 03:05:45,410
Might as well.

2525
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:48,530
I mean, the ruler did spend his entire life savings on this.

2526
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:50,710
I might as well entertain him a little bit.

2527
03:05:52,110 --> 03:05:52,730
Tough hen.

2528
03:05:58,170 --> 03:05:59,970

Alright.

2540
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:09,550
Um...

2541
03:08:09,550 --> 03:08:10,330
This way.

2542
03:08:11,610 --> 03:08:12,690
Is it this way?

2543
03:08:13,890 --> 03:08:14,210
No.

2544
03:08:14,530 --> 03:08:15,050
This way.

2545
03:08:21,830 --> 03:08:22,310
To here?

2546
03:08:24,470 --> 03:08:25,890
Where the fuck?

2547
03:08:32,760 --> 03:08:34,560
Hack the Harley costume?

2548
03:08:36,340 --> 03:08:37,280
What, this one?

2549
03:08:37,340 --> 03:08:38,560
The one I just broke?

2550
03:08:39,300 --> 03:08:42,320
I broke it though.

2551
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:46,600
Yeah, I don't think I can hack this.

2552
03:08:49,280 --> 03:08:50,540
Yeah, I'm just listening to the radio.

2553
03:08:51,360 --> 03:08:53,380
Oh, up there in the room above.

2554
03:08:53,900 --> 03:08:58,360
Oh, okay, I was gonna say, guys, I think it's broken, broken.

2555
03:08:59,400 --> 03:08:59,940
This one?

2556
03:09:00,500 --> 03:09:01,740
Oh, this one!

2557
03:09:01,940 --> 03:09:02,660
Wait, that's a robot?

2558
03:09:02,800 --> 03:09:03,180
What?

2559
03:09:04,220 --> 03:09:05,520
We created a robot?

2560
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:09,080
Wait, is that what the Joker is now?

2561
03:09:13,810 --> 03:09:15,610
Nope, I just listened to the radio.

2562
03:09:18,660 --> 03:09:20,320
I'm sorry, bozo.

2563
03:09:20,500 --> 03:09:22,560
I can't come to the phone right now.

2564
03:09:22,680 --> 03:09:24,160
I'm probably asked to win something.

2565
03:09:24,520 --> 03:09:24,960
Warden.

2566
03:09:25,420 --> 03:09:26,160
Quincy Sharp.

2567
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:29,840
Huh?

2568
03:09:32,980 --> 03:09:34,280
Is that a mannequin?

2569
03:09:34,520 --> 03:09:35,700
Oh, I thought it was a robot.

2570
03:09:43,980 --> 03:09:46,200
Yeah, no, I noticed the other outfit.

2571
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:47,800
I just thought it was like a...

2572
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:50,000
I hacked this.

2573
03:09:53,790 --> 03:09:55,050
Zoom in on the ground.

2574
03:09:55,270 --> 03:10:29,090
oh shit what she's pregnant oh my god his pull-up game is weak bro he's dying let him oh my god he got she got jokered oh my god that's crazy you would think like him dropping an acid meant like, you know, that's never going to be possible.

2575
03:10:31,210 --> 03:10:37,830
I would feel like the acid would like ruin like, would ruin it, you know?

2576
03:10:39,830 --> 03:10:40,410
My.

2577
03:10:42,930 --> 03:10:44,270
I don't know.

2578
03:10:44,330 --> 03:10:50,930
I feel like the acid would like sort of destroy any possibility of Harley Quinn getting Pregante.

2579
03:10:52,390 --> 03:10:53,790
Life finds a way.

2580
03:10:57,210 --> 03:10:59,510
Oh, yeah, no, the kid isn't gonna be okay.

2581
03:10:59,870 --> 03:11:01,050
No, 100%.

2582
03:11:01,050 --> 03:11:02,110
The kid ain't right.

2583
03:11:10,060 --> 03:11:10,720
I would agree.

2584
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:11,960
Yeah, see, he's still sick.

2585
03:11:12,060 --> 03:11:12,880
I knew it.

2586
03:11:15,140 --> 03:11:16,220
I knew it.

2587
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:18,300
There's no way he got better.

2588
03:11:18,740 --> 03:11:19,380

I know that Joker has bones.

2617
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:20,920
Who are you?

2618
03:14:26,750 --> 03:14:27,350

I was gonna see.

2630
03:15:06,940 --> 03:15:08,680
I was gonna say, I know that's not a mirror.

2631
03:15:08,960 --> 03:15:09,900
There's no way.

2632
03:15:10,140 --> 03:15:11,200
That's actually crazy.

2633
03:15:11,320 --> 03:15:13,620
He's like, okay, I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna make sure.

03:15:24,680 --> 03:15:26,820
Oh my god, I was in the middle of this shit.

2638
03:15:28,980 --> 03:15:30,140

2643
03:15:41,340 --> 03:15:41,800
That's right!

2644
03:15:43,640 --> 03:15:44,760
Oh, the combos!

2645
03:15:48,910 --> 03:15:50,110

Holy shit!

2652
03:16:16,120 --> 03:16:16,980
Holy shit!

2653
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:18,180
Where was he beating him?

2654
03:16:18,460 --> 03:16:19,640
Where did he find him?

2655
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:25,240
Actually, where the fuck did he find this man?

2656
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:32,920
Ultra, son.

2657
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:35,780
Beat down.

2658
03:16:36,420 --> 03:16:37,140
Oh, my God.

2659
03:16:37,820 --> 03:16:39,300
This guy is interrupting my beat down.

2660
03:16:40,140 --> 03:16:42,460
This guy is actually interrupting my beat down right now.

2661
03:16:43,400 --> 03:16:44,600
All right, there we go.

2662
03:16:45,220 --> 03:16:46,060
Titan, man.

2663
03:16:46,500 --> 03:16:47,320
And I hit nothing.

2664
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:52,080
Titan Shockwave!

2665
03:16:56,360 --> 03:16:57,480
All right, nice.

2666
03:16:58,040 --> 03:16:59,160
At least the car will help me.

2667
03:17:04,460 --> 03:17:04,740
Yeah.

2668
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:09,980
All right, now I got the double stun.

2669
03:17:10,580 --> 03:17:11,180
God damn it!

2670
03:17:11,280 --> 03:17:12,780
I'm trying to stun this man!

2671
03:17:15,980 --> 03:17:17,080

Thank God the big man picked him picked his goons up.

What are you with?

2689
03:18:51,940 --> 03:18:54,380
Your Batman just did it.

2690
03:19:08,070 --> 03:19:11,230
Yeah, me, him, and my 1 million gadgets.

2691
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,060
Any last requests?

2692
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:21,720
How about a joke?

2693
03:19:22,120 --> 03:19:23,020
How about a joke?

2694
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:23,820
Huh?

2695
03:19:24,440 --> 03:19:24,960
Let him go.

2696
03:19:26,420 --> 03:19:26,600
Tahlia!

2697
03:19:28,460 --> 03:19:30,160
My third girlfriend.

2698
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:32,300
Tahlia, what are you doing?

2699
03:19:32,780 --> 03:19:40,600
I represent the great Reish Algoon, head of the demon, master of the League of Assassins.

2700
03:19:41,220 --> 03:19:42,780
Well, bully for you.

2701
03:19:43,780 --> 03:19:48,160
Free Batman, and we will give you the secret of immortality.

2702
03:19:48,240 --> 03:19:49,580
My ex is having a meaning.

2703
03:19:51,040 --> 03:19:52,000
Don't be unstoppable.

2704
03:19:52,360 --> 03:19:52,760
What?

2705
03:19:53,040 --> 03:19:55,080
Oh no, my ex is working together.

2706
03:19:55,640 --> 03:19:57,420
Oh no, my worst nightmare.

2707
03:20:00,060 --> 03:20:01,160
Ha ha ha ha.

2708
03:20:03,520 --> 03:20:04,820
Do we have a deal?

2709
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:11,040
Oh, shut up.

2710
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:12,100
Oh.

2711
03:20:16,620 --> 03:20:18,880
We offered you this chance, Batman.

2712
03:20:20,020 --> 03:20:21,300
Now follow your heart.

2713
03:20:21,360 --> 03:20:22,520
Ex is conspiring.

2714
03:20:22,780 --> 03:20:24,280
Oh, wait, she put a tracker on.

2715
03:20:26,620 --> 03:20:28,260
How did Joker not see this?

2716
03:20:28,280 --> 03:20:59,900

2717
03:21:03,180 --> 03:21:04,800
I should kill you.

2718
03:21:06,540 --> 03:21:07,940
But you won't.

2719
03:21:11,480 --> 03:21:14,280
Oh, I'm kind of disappointed.

2720
03:21:16,900 --> 03:21:17,540
Damn.

2721
03:21:19,320 --> 03:21:21,940
Come on, I came all the way here.

2722
03:21:23,240 --> 03:21:23,960
No kiss?

2723
03:21:24,900 --> 03:21:27,060
Yeah, toxic Yuri and toxic Yowie.

2724
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:28,160
I...

2725
03:21:28,740 --> 03:21:29,440
You know what?

2726
03:21:29,440 --> 03:21:29,600
Okay.

2727
03:21:29,760 --> 03:21:30,680
You know what I think it is?

2728
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:31,660
And I think I'm right.

2729
03:21:32,040 --> 03:21:33,280
I think it's Clayface.

2730
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:35,780
Because we have yet to bump into Clayface.

2731
03:21:36,080 --> 03:21:38,600
And like Clayface doesn't have bones.

2732
03:21:38,680 --> 03:21:40,040
He's literally made out of clay.

2733
03:21:42,260 --> 03:21:43,300
I'm pretty sure.

2734
03:21:43,880 --> 03:21:45,800
You guys don't have to tell me if I'm right or not.

2735
03:21:45,940 --> 03:21:47,640
But like that's my game theory.

2736
03:21:49,660 --> 03:21:50,760
That's my theory.

2737
03:21:51,060 --> 03:21:52,260
My game theory.

2738
03:21:56,020 --> 03:21:56,280
Yeah.

2739
03:21:56,280 --> 03:21:58,260
Because I was like Why the fuck are you bones?

2740
03:21:58,280 --> 03:22:58,240
that's what happened to your bones the the surgeon take your fucking bones you know like because you wanted to have fun like it was they were supposed to go with the ribs but then you went a little overboard like I was like what the fuck wait a minute that don't make no sense and like you know we I'm pretty sure that was like literally them it was not a mirror like there was no way that was the mirror and the cutscene cut it so that I can't even check if it is a mirror or not it was yeah it was just supposed to be the bottom rib and but the surgeon got a little too had a little too much fun I'm what that's looking right me yeah do I have any special yet no I don't

2741
03:23:10,900 --> 03:23:36,820
I'm surprised two-faces oh shit okay you know okay wait we got it we gotta go we we don't worry I'm faster than a bullet do you though oh my god they might actually get me with them right I'm climbing this fucking wall I'm literally one HP call it in tiger command we're in sector two we were attacked the vault

2742
03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:42,980
Guys, I'm 1 HP.

2743
03:23:43,140 --> 03:23:44,420
This is not good.

2744
03:23:45,060 --> 03:23:46,660
Do I get any heals?

2745
03:23:51,100 --> 03:23:52,960
Do they have guns?

2746
03:23:54,700 --> 03:23:56,140
I barely have anything.

2747
03:23:56,400 --> 03:23:56,700
Oh, wait.

2748
03:23:57,480 --> 03:23:58,780
What the fuck is my bolas?

2749
03:24:07,330 --> 03:24:08,990
Is this like my bataran?

2750
03:24:11,310 --> 03:24:13,270
Does this kill or is it just a stun?

2751
03:24:14,110 --> 03:24:14,870
I need a no.

2752
03:24:19,620 --> 03:24:21,320
Oh, how come the detectives?

2753
03:24:23,100 --> 03:24:24,740
Was it killer or a stun?

2754
03:24:29,460 --> 03:24:30,860
Is, do you think he's tied up?

2755
03:24:32,560 --> 03:24:34,300
He does not look like he's tied up.

2756
03:24:34,540 --> 03:24:34,860
What's this?

2757
03:24:35,020 --> 03:24:35,660
The cow tops?

2758
03:24:46,710 --> 03:24:48,530
He must die from there.

2759
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,200
How is he dodging it?

2760
03:25:02,500 --> 03:25:04,020
It's coming from high ground.

2761
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:14,060
Okay.

2762
03:25:30,180 --> 03:25:31,100
Okay.

2763
03:25:35,850 --> 03:25:36,770
Okay.

2764
03:25:38,470 --> 03:25:40,650
When he starts crawling.

2765
03:25:42,550 --> 03:25:44,410
Okay, that's good.

2766
03:25:47,990 --> 03:25:49,050
I don't know.

2767
03:25:49,170 --> 03:25:52,730
I thought like, you know, wait, is he still...

2768
03:25:59,120 --> 03:25:59,560
Oh, shit.

2769
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:06,800
I got slapped.

2770
03:26:08,640 --> 03:26:11,720
I made it so far, too!

2771
03:26:14,780 --> 03:26:16,060
Oh my god, how...

2772
03:26:16,060 --> 03:26:17,100
Okay, it's right next to me.

2773
03:26:17,180 --> 03:26:17,600
Thank God.

2774
03:26:17,740 --> 03:26:21,420
I made it so far, and I just got slapped.

2775
03:26:23,640 --> 03:26:24,680
One punch!

2776
03:26:25,860 --> 03:26:27,320
Okay, we're gonna do this again.

2777
03:26:27,540 --> 03:26:28,320
I got an idea.

2778
03:26:35,810 --> 03:26:37,150
I'm like, what was that?

2779
03:26:39,470 --> 03:26:40,190
There you go.

2780
03:26:41,350 --> 03:26:41,870
Wee!

2781
03:26:47,570 --> 03:26:48,150
Okay.

2782
03:26:49,130 --> 03:26:51,050
They're just tripping off of the...

2783
03:26:51,050 --> 03:26:51,930
See, I told you.

2784
03:26:52,190 --> 03:26:53,850
I had a plan.

2785
03:26:56,170 --> 03:26:56,930
It worked.

2786
03:26:57,970 --> 03:26:58,790
Oh my god.

2787
03:26:59,050 --> 03:27:01,370
Bro, let him have fun, bro!

2788
03:27:05,720 --> 03:27:06,580
There you go.

2789
03:27:07,620 --> 03:27:08,340
No fun.

2790
03:27:08,540 --> 03:27:10,040
He's like, no fun allowed.

2791
03:27:12,460 --> 03:27:14,880
Yeah, it's a lot easier when, you know.

2792
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:17,440
Good girl, Ivy.

2793
03:27:19,060 --> 03:27:20,700
It's all easier when I have HP.

2794
03:27:21,580 --> 03:27:24,300
I guess you're tunneling into Stranger's Vault below ground.

2795
03:27:25,360 --> 03:27:26,180
He got jealous.

2796
03:27:26,400 --> 03:27:26,880
He did.

2797
03:27:28,140 --> 03:27:29,640
Let people enjoy things.

2798
03:27:30,300 --> 03:27:30,300
Exactly.

2799
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:31,460
Gosh, she's so weak.

2800
03:27:31,660 --> 03:27:32,760
She has, like, no HP.

2801
03:27:33,480 --> 03:27:34,580
There are Ivy's Vines.

2802
03:27:35,100 --> 03:27:36,800
And there's the storage facility.

2803
03:27:37,220 --> 03:27:38,120
Nice work, Red.

2804
03:27:38,500 --> 03:27:39,560
Time to get in there.

2805
03:27:42,460 --> 03:27:45,300
Oh, there's a lot of people here.

2806
03:27:46,240 --> 03:27:47,220
Open the door.

2807
03:27:47,440 --> 03:27:47,780
Okay.

2808
03:27:49,660 --> 03:27:50,180
Okay.

2809
03:27:50,860 --> 03:27:51,500
There's the vault.

2810
03:27:52,220 --> 03:27:54,340
Looks like a standard three card security protocol.

2811
03:27:55,320 --> 03:27:56,000
So standard.

2812
03:27:56,980 --> 03:27:58,940
You'd think these people would have learned by now.

2813
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:00,920
Hopefully the keys are down there.

2814
03:28:01,220 --> 03:28:01,940
I'm not- what?

2815
03:28:02,680 --> 03:28:03,600
I'm just talking to myself.

2816
03:28:03,840 --> 03:28:04,520
Like in my head?

2817
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:10,460
I'll need to be quick and stay out of sight.

2818
03:28:10,640 --> 03:28:11,820
Break into the vault.

2819
03:28:12,900 --> 03:28:13,180
Oh.

2820
03:28:13,860 --> 03:28:15,160
Wait, is this self?

2821
03:28:16,600 --> 03:28:17,440
Oh no.

2822
03:28:18,940 --> 03:28:19,460
Oh.

2823
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:21,660
I can't do anything without the three key cards.

2824
03:28:22,180 --> 03:28:22,340
Oh, no.

2825
03:28:22,360 --> 03:28:26,020
The only way to get them is to get close enough to the guards and help myself to them.

2826
03:28:26,860 --> 03:28:28,060
Wait, this is stealth.

2827
03:28:32,300 --> 03:28:33,020
Wait a minute.

2828
03:28:33,200 --> 03:28:33,940
This is stealth.

2829
03:28:35,900 --> 03:28:37,280
Wait a minute.

2830
03:28:38,380 --> 03:28:39,540
Can I do self-kills?

2831
03:28:39,940 --> 03:28:41,680
Oh, I can.

2832
03:28:43,220 --> 03:28:44,320
Oh, my God.

2833
03:28:44,400 --> 03:28:45,880
I can't even kill him.

2834
03:28:47,300 --> 03:28:48,760
Like, what's the point?

2835
03:28:50,460 --> 03:28:51,020
Okay.

2836
03:28:51,420 --> 03:28:53,940
I need to steal the key cards from the guards.

2837
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:56,160
Wait, can I not kill him?

2838
03:28:59,620 --> 03:29:01,140
What's wrong with you, Selena?

2839
03:29:01,560 --> 03:29:04,140
Trying to leave without retrieving your precious loot from strange...

2840
03:29:04,140 --> 03:29:05,500
Can I actually not kill these guys?

2841
03:29:05,620 --> 03:29:07,920
I have to, like...

2842
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:13,560
Oh, no, my weakness.

2843
03:29:24,270 --> 03:29:25,910
Can I put them to sleep?

2844
03:29:26,950 --> 03:29:28,430
Oh, my God, I can't.

2845
03:29:30,150 --> 03:29:36,250
can't oh my god that's so fucked up okay

2846
03:29:40,880 --> 03:29:43,700

2847
03:29:48,430 --> 03:30:12,570

2849
03:30:56,650 --> 03:30:57,130
Okay.

2850
03:30:58,890 --> 03:31:00,230
I'm trying to figure out how to...

2851
03:31:02,430 --> 03:31:04,110
How do I crawl to that area?

2852
03:31:05,750 --> 03:31:06,590
Oh, the ceiling.

2853
03:31:06,690 --> 03:31:08,250
They don't know how to look up, right?

2854
03:31:14,440 --> 03:31:17,280
I swear to God, if they start looking up...

2855
03:31:35,890 --> 03:31:37,270
Assume he's the last one.

2856
03:31:44,110 --> 03:31:44,990
They're gamers.

2857
03:31:49,790 --> 03:31:50,810
That's all the keys.

2858
03:31:51,470 --> 03:31:53,230
Next stop, the security room.

2859
03:31:54,350 --> 03:31:56,470
They did not get drafted to look up, guys.

2860
03:31:58,530 --> 03:31:59,350
Alright, we did it.

2861
03:32:02,470 --> 03:32:03,190
That was easy.

2862
03:32:03,490 --> 03:32:04,470
Wait, these guys are terrible.

2863
03:32:04,570 --> 03:32:05,950
Who the fuck hired them?

2864
03:32:07,410 --> 03:32:09,430
I might as well not have guards.

2865
03:32:09,790 --> 03:32:11,030
Like, what's the point?

2866
03:32:13,730 --> 03:32:14,610
I really...

2867
03:32:14,630 --> 03:32:15,970
I might as well.

2868
03:32:16,890 --> 03:32:18,690
What's the point of having guards?

2869
03:32:19,230 --> 03:32:20,070
Is this a drill?

2870
03:32:21,390 --> 03:32:22,630
Is this a drill?

2871
03:32:23,190 --> 03:32:23,770
Listen up.

2872
03:32:23,970 --> 03:32:24,610
The room is hot.

2873
03:32:24,870 --> 03:32:26,130
Spread out and search for intruders.

2874
03:32:26,490 --> 03:32:26,990
No prisoners.

2875
03:32:29,650 --> 03:32:30,910
I don't like this.

2876
03:32:31,530 --> 03:32:32,370
Do you think it's Batman?

2877
03:32:34,290 --> 03:32:35,090
I hope not.

2878
03:32:35,410 --> 03:32:36,350
We've got special orders.

2879
03:32:36,430 --> 03:32:38,370
I don't even need to be a master chief.

2880
03:32:39,030 --> 03:32:40,870
These guys are actually like...

2881
03:32:40,870 --> 03:32:43,950
I feel like they hired some guy off the street.

2882
03:32:44,630 --> 03:32:45,730
Oh, what do I do now?

2883
03:32:48,250 --> 03:32:48,950
Oh, okay.

2884
03:32:49,130 --> 03:32:50,070
They don't look up, right?

2885
03:32:51,410 --> 03:32:55,430
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

2886
03:32:56,690 --> 03:32:58,230
Oh, now I can kill them.

2887
03:32:58,650 --> 03:32:59,150
Oh, okay.

2888
03:33:00,710 --> 03:33:01,670
No, I can kill them now.

2889
03:33:06,510 --> 03:33:07,450
Wait, I can just chill.

2890
03:33:07,510 --> 03:33:08,790
Wait, they actually never look up.

2891
03:33:09,270 --> 03:33:09,910
Oh, you guys are right.

2892
03:33:10,110 --> 03:33:10,610
Oh, shit!

2893
03:33:11,910 --> 03:33:12,990
Okay, it's fine.

2894
03:33:13,630 --> 03:33:16,230
Oh, you guys are right.

2895
03:33:17,770 --> 03:33:18,890
look up.

2896
03:33:19,810 --> 03:33:24,110
Oh, they're covering every angle.

2897
03:33:27,470 --> 03:33:30,630
Wait, how the fuck do I do a silent takedown on this?

2898
03:33:33,510 --> 03:33:36,430
Wait, they're just like, bro, what the fuck they're camping?

2899
03:33:37,710 --> 03:33:39,750
They're not even splitting up, gang.

2900
03:33:43,070 --> 03:33:44,990
Bro, they're not even splitting up.

2901
03:33:45,630 --> 03:33:46,350
That's it.

2902
03:33:50,460 --> 03:33:51,180
Nice.

2903
03:33:56,980 --> 03:33:57,560
No, they won't.

2904
03:33:57,860 --> 03:33:59,840
If I get rid of all of them.

2905
03:34:01,500 --> 03:34:02,520
Check your numbers.

2906
03:34:04,440 --> 03:34:05,880
Check your numbers.

2907
03:34:06,440 --> 03:34:06,920
Target spotted.

2908
03:34:07,580 --> 03:34:08,220
No, you don't.

2909
03:34:09,400 --> 03:34:12,640
Me next.

2910
03:34:12,880 --> 03:34:13,840
Me next.

2911
03:34:14,060 --> 03:34:14,060
Me next.

2912
03:34:14,220 --> 03:34:16,540
When they pretend they don't see me.

2913
03:34:17,880 --> 03:34:18,660
Oh, shit!

2914
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:19,600
Oh!

2915
03:34:21,760 --> 03:34:22,320
Oh!

2916
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:23,000
Oh!

2917
03:34:28,070 --> 03:34:30,530
That guy was like, no touch!

2918
03:34:30,870 --> 03:34:31,810
No touch!

2919
03:34:33,970 --> 03:34:35,270
He looked up.

2920
03:34:35,830 --> 03:34:38,790
Everyone was pretending, but this guy...

2921
03:34:38,790 --> 03:34:39,570
Someone's opening the vault.

2922
03:34:40,150 --> 03:34:41,030
Is this a drill?

2923
03:34:41,750 --> 03:34:43,630
This guy was not...

2924
03:34:43,630 --> 03:34:46,090
It was like, guys, we all see this, right?

2925
03:34:47,090 --> 03:34:50,610
He was the only one that didn't want to pretend.

2926
03:34:51,670 --> 03:34:53,330
You think it's Batman?

2927
03:34:54,150 --> 03:35:14,910
it does laugh we've got special orders for him all right we can take this guy just some Arkham scum trying to get rich this guy he didn't get the member he's the only everyone else was straight but him no

2928
03:35:32,680 --> 03:35:33,480
Oh, shit.

2929
03:35:34,440 --> 03:35:34,460
No!

2930
03:35:34,840 --> 03:35:35,040
No!

2931
03:35:36,480 --> 03:35:36,880
Yoink.

2932
03:35:38,220 --> 03:35:38,760
No, you don't.

2933
03:35:40,560 --> 03:35:40,620
Ha-ha!

2934
03:35:40,940 --> 03:35:41,400
Where am I?

2935
03:35:42,320 --> 03:35:42,800
Ha-ha!

2936
03:35:43,320 --> 03:35:44,480
But where am I, though?

2937
03:35:46,060 --> 03:35:46,940
Yeah, that's right.

2938
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:48,960
Peek-a-boo!

2939
03:35:57,650 --> 03:35:58,030
Alright.

2940
03:36:02,250 --> 03:36:03,210
That's working, right?

2941
03:36:03,570 --> 03:36:05,470
I should have not split up with the gang, bro.

2942
03:36:06,170 --> 03:36:08,110
Shouldn't I split up?

2943
03:36:10,130 --> 03:36:16,270
I know why I don't stay on on high ground after We have confirmation that target is in the steel mill.

2944
03:36:16,270 --> 03:36:18,080
I repeat when he sees this

2945
03:36:22,090 --> 03:36:33,090
Last one You're the last one Wait, what if Goodbye

2946
03:36:36,110 --> 03:36:38,490
All your friends are gone now.

2947
03:36:42,230 --> 03:36:43,030
Open door.

2948
03:36:43,770 --> 03:36:44,250
Open sesame.

2949
03:36:45,030 --> 03:36:45,530
I did it.

2950
03:36:45,630 --> 03:36:46,130
I'm in.

2951
03:36:53,560 --> 03:36:54,520
Dr. Cranberry.

2952
03:36:54,760 --> 03:36:54,820
Thank you.

2953
03:36:55,020 --> 03:36:55,380
Super chat.

2954
03:36:55,480 --> 03:36:55,780
Thank you.

2955
03:36:56,140 --> 03:36:56,460
Thank you.

2956
03:36:56,760 --> 03:36:57,120
Not gonna lie.

2957
03:36:57,200 --> 03:37:00,580
If I chance to be choked up by Catwoman's feet, I think I'd be all right.

2958
03:37:02,280 --> 03:37:02,580
Thank you.

2959
03:37:02,620 --> 03:37:03,060
Oh, shit.

2960
03:37:03,140 --> 03:37:04,820
Wait, where the fuck do they come from?

2961
03:37:04,900 --> 03:37:06,280
I guess keeps getting better.

2962
03:37:06,920 --> 03:37:08,280
That's not what will soon be dead.

2963
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:09,800
What the fuck?

2964
03:37:14,780 --> 03:37:16,760
Where the fuck did you guys come from?

2965
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:24,340
Okay Okay, that's not cool, bro.

2966
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:26,400
That's not cool.

2967
03:37:26,720 --> 03:37:28,540
I was having a fight here

2968
03:37:32,660 --> 03:37:36,120
Okay, I missed the tools not gonna lie.

2969
03:37:36,420 --> 03:37:41,520
I do miss it The tools were pretty good I

2970
03:37:45,440 --> 03:37:47,240
Oh my god, I'm just getting kicked.

2971
03:37:48,620 --> 03:37:55,160
I need to, like, make sure I time the counters correctly, too.

2972
03:37:55,560 --> 03:37:57,820
Because there's so many people trying to counter me.

2973
03:38:00,120 --> 03:38:01,040
Uh, get out of here.

2974
03:38:02,060 --> 03:38:05,180
I can't even do finishers because they're all trying to kick me.

2975
03:38:08,630 --> 03:38:09,170
Okay, nice.

2976
03:38:11,810 --> 03:38:13,070
That's right, get over here!

2977
03:38:13,570 --> 03:38:14,390
Get beat down!

2978
03:38:15,010 --> 03:38:15,530
into?

2979
03:38:16,250 --> 03:38:17,630
This was a 1v1.

2980
03:38:18,250 --> 03:38:18,570
That's right.

2981
03:38:18,670 --> 03:38:19,630
You think this was over?

2982
03:38:22,670 --> 03:38:23,950
That's acting right.

2983
03:38:24,770 --> 03:38:29,230
Batman is down?

2984
03:38:30,170 --> 03:38:32,390
Oh god, get my briefcase first.

2985
03:38:33,790 --> 03:38:35,450
I got the score of a lifetime.

2986
03:38:35,910 --> 03:38:38,810
Oh shit, I'm supposed to get Ivy shit too.

2987
03:38:41,810 --> 03:38:42,970
this is awkward.

2988
03:38:44,070 --> 03:38:45,650
I forgot to pick up the that.

2989
03:38:48,450 --> 03:38:49,670
Oh, shit.

2990
03:38:54,630 --> 03:38:56,750
But I'm rich now.

2991
03:38:57,430 --> 03:38:59,090
Oh, that's... God.

2992
03:39:00,730 --> 03:39:01,530
Whoopsie.

2993
03:39:05,030 --> 03:39:12,590
That's... Oh, at least it's... How was I supposed to know I can't pick two?

2994
03:39:13,950 --> 03:39:15,990
Well, you tried your best.

2995
03:39:16,330 --> 03:39:18,290
Am I supposed to is this like a choice?

2996
03:39:18,810 --> 03:39:20,610
What happens if I don't pick up the plant?

2997
03:39:21,470 --> 03:39:22,870
Wait, do I have to restart?

2998
03:39:23,910 --> 03:39:25,530
Oh my god.

2999
03:39:25,910 --> 03:39:27,070
That's bullshit.

3000
03:39:33,320 --> 03:39:35,260
Does anything happen?

3001
03:39:37,380 --> 03:39:38,200
No, you don't.

3002
03:39:38,420 --> 03:39:38,720
Okay.

3003
03:39:40,200 --> 03:39:41,720
I can just abandon Batman.

3004
03:39:42,060 --> 03:39:42,600
Okay, cool.

3005
03:39:43,260 --> 03:39:45,160
She will destroy it.

3006
03:39:50,540 --> 03:39:52,160
No, she She just breaks it.

3007
03:39:53,300 --> 03:39:54,480
Oh, it doesn't do anything?

3008
03:39:54,760 --> 03:39:55,020
Okay.

3009
03:39:59,940 --> 03:40:01,480
Oh, she just breaks the plat?

3010
03:40:01,640 --> 03:40:03,240
Okay, well, that's fine.

3011
03:40:04,660 --> 03:40:05,080
What if it doesn't...

3012
03:40:05,080 --> 03:40:06,820
My choices don't matter, I guess.

3013
03:40:09,980 --> 03:40:10,860
My choices...

3014
03:40:13,400 --> 03:40:14,240
That's fine.

3015
03:40:14,920 --> 03:40:15,640
Choices don't matter.

3016
03:40:15,800 --> 03:40:16,180
I'm taking...

3017
03:40:16,180 --> 03:40:17,200
Oh, wait, there is Batman.

3018
03:40:17,420 --> 03:40:17,920
Oh, my God.

3019
03:40:18,040 --> 03:40:18,960
Wait, what happened to him?

3020
03:40:19,220 --> 03:40:20,080
You can do it.

3021
03:40:20,340 --> 03:40:22,380
Just walk right out of here and leave him.

3022
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:23,320
It's easy.

3023
03:40:24,840 --> 03:40:26,840
You'll never forgive yourself, Selina.

3024
03:40:27,460 --> 03:40:29,020
Save Batman, then get out of here.

3025
03:40:29,060 --> 03:40:29,840
What if I just leave?

3026
03:40:30,580 --> 03:40:31,980
It's not like he'll die.

3027
03:40:33,900 --> 03:40:34,760
You're right.

3028
03:40:35,120 --> 03:40:35,300
Wait.

3029
03:40:35,780 --> 03:40:37,060
What if I leave?

3030
03:40:38,560 --> 03:40:39,060
Go.

3031
03:40:40,260 --> 03:40:41,480
Yeah, just leave.

3032
03:40:41,500 --> 03:40:42,220
Batman will be fine.

3033
03:40:42,260 --> 03:40:43,040
He'll be fine, right?

3034
03:40:43,220 --> 03:40:44,340
He has his robins.

3035
03:40:44,500 --> 03:40:45,420
He doesn't need me.

3036
03:40:45,860 --> 03:40:47,620
Leave Arkham City.

3037
03:40:48,040 --> 03:40:49,260
Let's like it go.

3038
03:40:54,140 --> 03:40:55,080
Like him.

3039
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:56,560
Yeah, he'll be fine.

3040
03:40:56,780 --> 03:40:58,060
He doesn't need me.

3041
03:40:58,320 --> 03:40:59,260
Who cares?

3042
03:41:00,240 --> 03:41:02,080
Money, money, money.

3043
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:06,300
All right, how much does this affect the story if I say?

3044
03:41:10,980 --> 03:41:12,260
Forget Batman.

3045
03:41:13,940 --> 03:41:17,640
Wait, the game actually... Oh my god, I can finish the game right now?

3046
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:20,920
I can literally finish the game right now?

3047
03:41:28,870 --> 03:41:29,690
Wait, can I?

3048
03:41:29,790 --> 03:41:30,450
Oh my god.

3049
03:41:30,710 --> 03:41:31,970
Wait, can I actually go back?

3050
03:41:32,670 --> 03:41:35,550
Drop suitcases and rescue Batman.

3051
03:41:36,150 --> 03:41:36,570
Imagine.

3052
03:41:38,190 --> 03:41:38,950
Let's go.

3053
03:41:38,990 --> 03:41:45,610
Wait, can I... If I finish this game and it gives me an ending, do I restart the checkpoint or am I fucked?

3054
03:41:52,550 --> 03:41:54,390
Alright, GG's, guys.

3055
03:41:57,690 --> 03:41:58,490
Screw him.

3056
03:41:59,210 --> 03:42:00,230
Screw him.

3057
03:42:03,490 --> 03:42:04,370
Yay!

3058
03:42:07,410 --> 03:42:09,650
We finished the game!

3059
03:42:11,710 --> 03:42:15,450
We got the good ending because we got rich, guys.

3060
03:42:18,130 --> 03:42:20,670
Literally said, screw him.

3061
03:42:23,170 --> 03:42:24,970
I did it!

3062
03:42:25,530 --> 03:42:26,010
Yay!

3063
03:42:26,370 --> 03:42:27,850
And we speedrun.

3064
03:42:31,370 --> 03:42:32,630
Batman died!

3065
03:42:34,330 --> 03:42:37,650
I would say that's a good ending.

3066
03:42:38,430 --> 03:42:38,870
It's okay.

3067
03:42:38,990 --> 03:42:40,990
One of the robins will just take over.

3068
03:42:42,650 --> 03:42:44,990
We don't need no man.

3069
03:42:49,050 --> 03:42:50,450
Oh shit, everyone.

3070
03:42:51,970 --> 03:42:54,130
Well, it's Catwoman's good ending.

3071
03:42:57,450 --> 03:42:58,290
Oh.

3072
03:43:16,310 --> 03:43:18,050
Where the fuck is Superman?

3073
03:43:20,210 --> 03:43:21,050
Oh.

3074
03:43:23,210 --> 03:43:23,930
Oh.

3075
03:43:26,230 --> 03:43:26,950
Oh.

3076
03:43:30,630 --> 03:43:35,530
The game was like, okay, let's do this again, Doki.

3077
03:43:36,190 --> 03:43:39,710
Let's see if Superman has his own problems.

3078
03:43:40,990 --> 03:43:41,990
Oh, okay.

3079
03:43:44,390 --> 03:43:46,430
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck?

3080
03:43:47,810 --> 03:43:51,950
Is Superman just letting Gotham City just go, like, just go out?

3081
03:43:51,970 --> 03:44:09,490
Anarchy like who I I assume Gotham City is it's not its own state, you know I assume Gotham City is also part of the United States and because it's still part of the United States of America You know the other superheroes would come in and help them out.

3082
03:44:09,490 --> 03:44:13,310
It's easy You'll never forgive yourself.

3083
03:44:13,630 --> 03:44:29,170
Not my city Out of his jurisdiction of fucking having the justice league if the league ain't gonna help since when did you grow a conscience

3084
03:44:34,720 --> 03:44:53,440
yes i'll have to help batman i'm coming to save you i guess ain't no league here it's like the league is here to help everyone but batman all right where is batman in the steel mill all right

3085
03:44:57,510 --> 03:44:58,630
It's like...

3086
03:44:58,630 --> 03:45:00,270
See what I give up for you, Batman.

3087
03:45:00,830 --> 03:45:03,910
Everything but Gotham City.

3088
03:45:04,290 --> 03:45:05,450
It's not their jurisdiction.

3089
03:45:06,490 --> 03:45:09,030
Well, what do we have here?

3090
03:45:11,570 --> 03:45:14,770
Gotham City pays similar space taxes?

3091
03:45:17,390 --> 03:45:21,030
If not, Bruce Wayne has funded like 50% of America.

3092
03:45:21,310 --> 03:45:21,530
You're right.

3093
03:45:22,130 --> 03:45:23,590
I think I chipped a nail back there.

3094
03:45:23,990 --> 03:45:24,790
You stick with the green.

3095
03:45:25,670 --> 03:45:27,050
handle the wisecracks.

3096
03:45:27,290 --> 03:45:29,390
She just needs someone to pick up, like, some rubble?

3097
03:45:29,670 --> 03:45:30,690
10 is now, right?

3098
03:45:31,170 --> 03:45:33,450
If you're planning on stopping it, you need to hurry.

3099
03:45:34,630 --> 03:45:38,970
Yeah, if Flash gets in trouble, every Justice League member comes to save him.

3100
03:45:40,610 --> 03:45:41,350
That's it!

3101
03:45:42,650 --> 03:45:46,650
They lost Gotham City because he couldn't get out of a pile of rocks?

3102
03:45:48,290 --> 03:45:49,430
See, like, totally look at that.

3103
03:45:49,790 --> 03:45:52,370
Like, um, we can't even check if it's a mirror or not.

3104
03:45:55,210 --> 03:45:55,590
Really?

3105
03:45:55,670 --> 03:45:56,290
You're right.

3106
03:45:56,570 --> 03:45:58,730
Bruce Wayne has, like, 90% tax cut.

3107
03:45:59,710 --> 03:46:00,290
You're so right.

3108
03:46:02,830 --> 03:46:05,810
Strange is launching missile strikes on Arkham City from Wonder Tower.

3109
03:46:06,750 --> 03:46:07,890
You shut this place down.

3110
03:46:08,590 --> 03:46:09,730
Joker's taken Talia.

3111
03:46:10,050 --> 03:46:12,950
Yeah, the Tibetan monks did not teach him how to get out of rocks.

3112
03:46:13,530 --> 03:46:15,110
I need your help to stop the attack.

3113
03:46:16,410 --> 03:46:17,330
He'll kill Talia.

3114
03:46:17,510 --> 03:46:19,210
You need to think this through.

3115
03:46:19,930 --> 03:46:22,430
Batman can't let all these people die.

3116
03:46:22,970 --> 03:46:24,270

03:47:49,430 --> 03:47:50,750
Oh, there's the missiles.

3123
03:47:54,620 --> 03:47:58,940
I mean, they're killing the criminals, which is more than what I did.

3124
03:48:00,900 --> 03:48:02,380
How the fuck did I get inside again?

3125
03:48:03,680 --> 03:48:04,360
I don't remember.

3126
03:48:07,300 --> 03:48:08,780
Oh, wait, that's just the water.

3127
03:48:14,720 --> 03:48:16,420
Oh, there it is.

3128
03:48:18,100 --> 03:48:18,260
Alright.

3129
03:48:21,670 --> 03:48:22,970
I got the Titan.

3130
03:48:23,950 --> 03:48:23,950
Then?

3131
03:48:24,690 --> 03:48:25,210
Oh, there you are.

3132
03:48:25,350 --> 03:48:26,190
I was like, where did you go?

3133
03:48:27,830 --> 03:48:29,650
I destroyed the containers, Bing.

3134
03:48:30,690 --> 03:48:30,690
Good.

3135
03:48:31,250 --> 03:48:32,310
On the ground, prisoner.

03:48:32,770 --> 03:48:33,010
Now.

3137
03:48:33,170 --> 03:48:33,750

Help me, Papa.

3139
03:48:35,330 --> 03:48:36,230
We must not have...

3140
03:48:36,230 --> 03:48:37,690
Alright, you could literally just crush them.

3141
03:48:37,830 --> 03:48:38,330
Like, you don't...

3142
03:48:38,330 --> 03:48:39,650
What the fuck?

3143
03:48:39,790 --> 03:48:40,670
Okay, that's a lot.

3144
03:48:40,950 --> 03:48:41,530
Never mind.

3145
03:48:42,130 --> 03:48:42,950
That's a lot.

03:48:47,900 --> 03:48:51,120

03:49:02,020 --> 03:49:02,960
That's what I like to see.

3150
03:49:09,430 --> 03:49:11,030
That's what I like to see, bro.

3151
03:49:12,710 --> 03:49:16,910
I would like it if you don't try and get the same people I'm getting, you know?

3152
03:49:20,940 --> 03:49:22,520
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

Do it.

3154
03:49:27,280 --> 03:49:27,760
Boom.

3155
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:32,110
Wait, I got this combo, so...

3156
03:49:34,840 --> 03:49:35,860
Okay, that was me.

3157
03:49:36,040 --> 03:49:37,200
You accidentally hit me.

3158
03:49:40,420 --> 03:49:41,600
Okay, bro, dude.

3159
03:49:42,680 --> 03:49:42,760

Friendly fire.

3162
03:49:49,440 --> 03:49:51,420
As I was saying, I've destroyed mine.

3163
03:49:51,820 --> 03:49:52,800
I take it you've done the same.

3164
03:49:52,960 --> 03:49:54,200
Okay, back to your actual conversation.

No.

3169
03:51:04,980 --> 03:51:06,120
You'll get out.

3170
03:51:06,420 --> 03:51:06,840
Eventually.

3171
03:51:07,660 --> 03:51:09,000
I'm too busy to keep biting you.

3172
03:51:09,020 --> 03:51:12,080
Yeah, you gotta, like, call Alfred to pencil yourself in.

3173
03:51:12,340 --> 03:51:14,000
You can't do this to me.

3174
03:51:15,000 --> 03:51:15,720
Don't worry.

3175
03:51:15,940 --> 03:51:17,000
We'll sign you up.

3176
03:51:17,400 --> 03:51:19,160
We'll sign you up on Titan Anonymous.

3177
03:51:20,460 --> 03:51:22,620
We're gonna get you to help you, Nene, Bane.

3178
03:51:25,200 --> 03:51:26,240
Alright, let's see.

3179
03:51:26,380 --> 03:51:27,500
What do we want to...

3180
03:51:29,140 --> 03:51:30,760
What do we want to upgrade?

3181
03:51:31,540 --> 03:51:33,880
Line launcher, tight rope, Sonic.

3182
03:51:35,440 --> 03:51:36,280
What's this?

3183
03:51:37,000 --> 03:51:39,720
I feel like I don't really need that hacking that much.

3184
03:51:40,680 --> 03:51:41,720
Free flow focus.

3185
03:51:42,100 --> 03:51:42,840
We're achieving.

3186
03:51:43,620 --> 03:51:44,800
We'll enter free flow.

3187
03:51:44,900 --> 03:51:46,260
Oh, wait, that's cool.

3188
03:51:46,400 --> 03:51:47,340
I want to try that.

3189
03:51:49,040 --> 03:51:50,700
He's in his little timeout corner.

3190
03:51:51,400 --> 03:51:52,740
Oh, I could have given her armor.

3191
03:51:53,720 --> 03:51:53,920
Whoops.

3192
03:51:54,120 --> 03:51:54,620
I don't know.

3193
03:51:54,660 --> 03:51:58,360
I feel like I don't use Catwoman enough to justify giving her my upgrades.

3194
03:51:59,420 --> 03:52:00,880
Like, does she not have her own?

3195
03:52:00,980 --> 03:52:02,900
Does she like share my upgrades chat?

3196
03:52:12,110 --> 03:52:13,810
Like, does she even share it?

3197
03:52:14,290 --> 03:52:14,710
No?

3198
03:52:15,010 --> 03:52:16,770
Oh, okay, so I just have to play her.

3199
03:52:19,950 --> 03:52:21,250
Like, like my level ups.

3200
03:52:21,510 --> 03:52:24,650
If I get the XP, does she share my level ups for XP?

3201
03:52:31,550 --> 03:52:32,770
Oh, it's auto rain.

3202
03:52:36,560 --> 03:52:38,280
Oh, she shares XP.

3203
03:52:38,520 --> 03:52:42,500
Okay, so if I already use it so she can use it when I'm I'm playing here.

3204
03:52:42,820 --> 03:52:43,320
I get it.

3205
03:52:43,480 --> 03:52:43,740
I get it.

3206
03:52:43,740 --> 03:52:43,820
All right.

3207
03:52:43,920 --> 03:53:04,000
We're gonna comment here because I want to I don't think I can play I don't know if I can play two more hours today Just because like tomorrow I do have a stream tomorrow and it's sponsor related I don't know if I can announce it yet, but it will be on YouTube the sponsor So that's why I don't want to overdo it.

3208
03:53:04,020 --> 03:53:05,380
Maybe I want to do a rival stream later.

3209
03:53:05,540 --> 03:53:05,980
Who knows?

3210
03:53:09,300 --> 03:54:11,740
Oh, I should scan I might as well scan it right now out like since he's here he's easier already so i'm better as well oh he doesn't have the master control all right i guess bye i mean well now we know that helicopter didn't have it but yeah that's fun though it's fun playing i really i really i've been really um enjoying batman so far um it's really i feel like the arkham series they did they did so many callbacks to a of like the law like history around batman i feel like if damian was around that time they would have included damian as well um i wonder if jason shows up or any of the other uh robins show up but it's been really fun so far and i'm enjoying myself uh yeah i'm gonna call it here everybody i hope you guys had a fun time watching as always um yeah it's very it's sad that you know the arkham series um got worse as it went on.

3211
03:54:12,160 --> 03:54:17,880
It's fucked up that the Arkham series was not about Batman later on.

3212
03:54:17,980 --> 03:54:19,340
Like, I think that's fucked up.

3213
03:54:20,200 --> 03:54:22,020
And then they killed him off, too.

3214
03:54:22,380 --> 03:54:29,420
They killed off Batman in his own fucking series, which I will say is very messed up to do.

3215
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:33,140
And then they're like, don't worry, guys.

3216
03:54:33,220 --> 03:54:35,100
We're bringing the Arkham series back.

3217
03:54:35,540 --> 03:54:38,220
But you can only play it in VR.

3218
03:54:40,300 --> 03:54:42,440
Like, Yippee

3219
03:54:45,660 --> 03:55:15,780
Um Um but yeah Tomorrow we do have another We have a sponsor stream Usually I don't stream on Sunday But like I said We do have a sponsor And also I haven't started my street fighter training yet But I feel like I should I should start today Just because I feel really bad Because like I saw my teammates Have already started practicing But already started practicing For the street fighter tournament next week So So I gotta practice that starting today because I have yet to touch Tree Fighter.

3220
03:55:18,000 --> 03:55:24,840
But anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3221
03:55:25,020 --> 03:55:28,160
And if you step for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3222
03:55:28,380 --> 03:55:31,960
