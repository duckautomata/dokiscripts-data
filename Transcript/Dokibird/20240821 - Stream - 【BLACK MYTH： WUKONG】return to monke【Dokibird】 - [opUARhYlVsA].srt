1
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,350
Guys, I have a problem at work.

2
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,290
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,270
I'm sorry I'm late.

4
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,690
I have a problem.

5
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,310
You know, what's the worst part?

6
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,590
The worst part is that I was fine.

7
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,490
I would not have played Overwatch.

8
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,730
But I got faded.

9
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,190
I was working, you see.

10
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,470
I was working.

11
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:30,570
And then one of my friends messaged me at like 1 in the morning.

12
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,330
And was like, hey, you want to play a couple of Overwatch games?

13
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,150
And I was like, okay.

14
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,470
So...

15
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,270
It's a duo.

16
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:41,810
It's a couple.

17
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,810
It should be fine.

18
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,890
And then they were like, oh, sorry.

19
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,950
And then we played one game.

20
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,670
We played one game.

21
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,230
And they were like, oh, sorry.

22
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,730
I got to go.

23
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,310
I was like, no.

24
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,070
No, I was so close.

25
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,970
So I was like, you know what?

26
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,910
The season just started.

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,030
It can't be that bad.

28
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,330
.

29
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:07,990
.

30
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,050
The season just started.

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,450
It can't be that bad.

32
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,850
Solo queueing.

33
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,590
You know?

34
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,930
And I was like, I'm just going to solo queue.

35
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,890
And it can't be that bad.

36
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,750
The season just started.

37
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,870
And I was like, I won.

38
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,570
I won.

39
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,950
Oh, my God.

40
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,690
Maybe I can solo queue to the Masters right now.

41
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:35,990
Maybe I can solo queue to the Masters right now.

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,710
And then I kept winning.

43
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,010
And then I lost.

44
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,730
But then I was like, oh, no, I can't end on a loss.

45
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,850
But then I was like, oh, no, I can't end on a loss.

46
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,090
And then I was winning again.

47
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,270
I was like, oh, I might as well just go to bed until I get Masters at this point if I'm still winning.

48
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,770
I was like, oh, I might as well just go to bed until I get Masters at this point if I'm still winning.

49
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,430
And then it was 6 in the morning.

50
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,190
And then it was 6 in the morning.

51
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,790
And then it was 6 in the morning.

52
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,670
And then it was 6 in the morning.

53
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,610
Six in the morning.

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,810
And I was like...

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,110
Oh no.

56
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,170
I have a problem.

57
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,750
You know...

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,130
You know what's the worst part about that?

59
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,230
One of my friends actually told me like...

60
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,570
I think we do need an intervention.

61
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,210
They're like...

62
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,850
I think you need rehab.

63
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,510
And I was like...

64
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:34,990
No.

65
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,650
I'll be okay.

66
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,230
I was like... It was like six in the morning.

67
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,070
I was like...

68
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,450
No.

69
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,410
I'll be okay.

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,830
It's not that bad.

71
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,430
And I realized...

72
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,930
Oh wait.

73
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,270
I don't really have a thumbnail yet.

74
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,330
And I was like...

75
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,850
Wait.

76
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,790
I need to do a little bit of work first.

77
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,670
And I went to bed at like...

78
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,990
Seven in the morning.

79
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,590
And then I was like... No.

80
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,090
I'll be okay.

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,410
That's like eight, nine, ten, eleven...

82
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,130
That's like five hours of sleep.

83
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,690
I'll be okay.

84
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,110
And then I realized... Wait.

85
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,590
I have to walk dad.

86
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,190
Because if I sleep now...

87
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,230
At six in the morning...

88
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,550
I wouldn't have enough...

89
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,030
I wouldn't be able to walk him in time.

90
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,890
So I was like... Okay.

91
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,830
I'll go walk.

92
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,570
I'll go walk dad.

93
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,830
Before I head to bed.

94
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,070
And feed him.

95
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,150
I played for so long.

96
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,090
That it was eating time.

97
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,350
And I was like... No.

98
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,230
I don't have a problem.

99
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,290
I don't have a problem.

100
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,890
To my friend.

101
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,050
I was like...

102
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,370
That's enough sleep.

103
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,210
And I woke up today.

104
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,430
And I messaged my friend.

105
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,630
And I was like... I think I have a problem.

106
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,570
I'm so fucking tired.

107
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,110
I was like...

108
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,070
Why didn't anyone stop me?

109
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,610
And my friend was like...

110
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,370
We tried.

111
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,910
But...

112
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,830
You were the one.

113
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,790
That decided to solo queue.

114
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,710
Overwatch.

115
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,930
I was like... Okay.

116
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,250
I need to show you guys.

117
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,130
I know you guys are like... Oh my god.

118
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,310
Doki.

119
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,050
I thought this was...

120
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,910
I need to show you.

121
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,810
One of my games.

122
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,150
Because they got played.

123
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,450
My master rank up game.

124
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,610
Was at...

125
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,110
My...

126
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,930
My master's rank up game.

127
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,990
Was actually...

128
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,890
So fucking crazy.

129
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,550
Because...

130
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,890
There was a player on...

131
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,710
My team.

132
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,930
And like...

133
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,590
He ended up getting 30k damage.

134
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,390
And I was like...

135
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,270
My Ashe is so good.

136
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,250
And then...

137
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,870
It should have been a red card.

138
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,510
Because like...

139
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,410
It should have been like a red flag to me.

140
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,490
Because the second most damage...

141
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,170
Um...

142
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,450
In both DPS teams...

143
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,210
Is...

144
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,990
12k.

145
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,370
So it was like 12k versus 30k.

146
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,350
And all I could...

147
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,430
It was 6 in the morning chat.

148
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,470
It was...

149
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,310
I was like...

150
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,790
Whoa.

151
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,570
He's so good at this game.

152
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,470
And then...

153
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:23,990
But like...

154
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,910
Nobody said anything.

155
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,470
That's the thing.

156
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,090
Nobody said anything.

157
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,630
Not my team.

158
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,570
Not the enemy team.

159
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,190
No one said anything.

160
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,710
So I was just like...

161
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,630
This is just 6am queues.

162
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,190
In my head I was just like...

163
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,350
This could just be 6am queues.

164
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,730
And...

165
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,050
I just got a really good...

166
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,410
Really really good player who's like...

167
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,710
Smurfing or some shit.

168
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,450
Because he had good game mechanics.

169
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,830
Like he was like dodging bullets.

170
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,250
And like he was like using his gun.

171
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,050
Okay it should have been red flag.

172
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,750
When he like...

173
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,890
He like... He got... I nanoed him twice.

174
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,710
Because I was like...

175
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,110
Wait he is actually really good.

176
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,950
So I nanoed him.

177
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,830
And in the moment he got nanoed.

178
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,890
He just went into 1v5.

179
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,530
He literally got off high ground.

180
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,690
And just stood in front of everybody.

181
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,410
And then killed 3 people.

182
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,510
But then all I could think about was like...

183
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,050
Damn that nano was sick.

184
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,610
I was like...

185
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:25,790
Wow.

186
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,290
Because he had a mercy pocket.

187
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,050
The mercy was not healing anybody.

188
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,230
Barely healed anybody else.

189
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,590
And...

Legitimately just standing there.

00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,070
Not moving.

195
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,110

196
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,750
She just stood next to him.

197
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,450

00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,230
But I saw they played a game and I was like what the fuck was I watching?

389
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,650
Hahaha.

390
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,710
Oh no.

391
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,230
He just has a really good game chair.

392
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,090
You better yup it's not.

393
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,830
By popular vote.

394
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:18,910
You guys want Chinese speech I wish you could turn the text bigger.

395
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,470
I wish you could turn the text bigger.

396
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,270
My only concern about this game is that the text is so fucking small.

397
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,510
I hate it.

398
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,750
I really wish the text was just a li- if it's a little bit bigger, it would've been like, fine.

399
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,070
But, um...

400
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,750
No.

401
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,350
No, you can't.

402
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:45,390
You can only turn on subtitles, turn on colorblind, and then like, turn off motion blur for accessibility.

403
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,850
And then for these, it's just like, you know, text, speech, subtitles.

404
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,110
Um...

405
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,230
Um, yeah, we all gotta read.

406
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,250
The people demand it!

407
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,510
Oh!

408
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,410
Okay.

409
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,610
Wait, okay.

410
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,670
Somebody gave, like, a really good idea.

411
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:10,790
But then the thing is, if I do it, it might look really off.

412
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,430
Okay, wait, I have a really good idea.

413
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,410
Let me- let me see if I can- alright, give me a sec.

414
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,650
Alright, copy.

415
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,210
Paste.

416
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,250
Ooh, now you don't see me.

417
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,170
I actually like that idea.

418
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,330
Someone was like, just- just magnify the text.

419
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,550
I was like, wait, that's actually- that's actually smart.

420
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,670
That's actually so smart, but it's gonna look so fucking weird.

421
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,270
But we'll see.

422
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,210
We'll see.

423
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,270
He just needs to talk.

424
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,050
Alright.

425
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,590
Alright.

426
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,710
I don't know what sound guy is here, but, like, I adjusted the volume just a little bit more.

427
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,250
Because I know, like, the Chinese speech is a little bit more quiet.

428
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,230
It's a bit quiet- more quiet than, uh, than the English dub.

429
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,590
Oh!

430
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,130
No, you're not late.

431
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,090
I had a- I had a 17 minute rant about Overwatch.

432
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:14,910
Okay.

433
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,390
Alright.

434
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,710
Monkey.

435
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,830
I like it.

436
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,950
Okay, we're monkeying.

437
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,130
Have I- do I have all the upgrades on?

438
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,750
I don't even remember what I did.

439
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,730
Alright, uh... set brew.

440
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,650
Okay, yeah, I do.

441
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,590
Alright.

442
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,570
I should have everything, right?

443
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,010
I have to make sure.

444
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,010
I gotta double check.

445
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,950
My brain is still waking up, guys.

446
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:40,930
Uh...

447
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,870
It's not the one I'm using?

448
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,110
Wait, what is this?

449
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh!

450
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Oh, these are my items that I've never used.

451
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,700
Oops.

452
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,010
Oops.

453
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,790
Oh, I have other- oh.

454
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,190
That's awkward.

455
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,350
It's pretty awkward.

456
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,370
Oh, that's, like, consumable.

457
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,030
Oh, yeah, I was saving- um...

458
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,470
Guys, you can't- you don't understand.

459
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,370
This gourd?

460
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,550
I only have one use, guys.

461
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,630
You don't understand.

462
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,310
I can't use it.

463
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,710
Guys, I have one use.

464
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,330
If I use it, I don't have it anymore.

465
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,710
Guys, you don't understand.

466
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,710
It's- it's very important to me.

467
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,850
Okay, let's see.

468
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,990
Did I craft- did I craft- did I use my two silk yet?

469
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,250
It's for the final boss.

470
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:58,610
Exactly.

471
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,250
Chat, it's for the final boss.

472
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,450
Guys.

473
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,930
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

474
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,990
Like, when you're a monkey, I don't know where to go.

475
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,030
Oh, I found it.

476
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,010
Guys, I found it.

477
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,650
Nice.

478
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,250
All right.

479
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,610
I know where to go now.

480
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,590
Nice.

481
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,830
Yasmin, thank you for the super chat.

482
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,790
Thank you, thank you.

483
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,090
Oh, shit!

484
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,790
Oh, my God.

485
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,410
What the-

486
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,290
How strong are their arrows?

487
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,390
Why are the rats stronger than the wolves?

488
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,850
They're smiling.

489
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,990
How are the rats stronger?

490
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,710
What the fuck are the wolves doing?

491
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,890
How the fuck do I get up there?

492
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,690
Where actually how the fuck do I get up there?

493
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,830
This is bullshit.

494
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,270
This is bullshit.

495
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,070
This is actually bullshit.

496
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,910
If I can't get up there, I'm going to open your door.

497
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,970
You can't open the door, guys.

498
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,450
It doesn't let me open the door.

499
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,410
Wait, how the fuck do I get in?

500
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,730
Wait, how the fuck do I get in?

501
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:21,730
How the fuck do I get in?

502
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,490
Oh shit!

503
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:23,550
Oh shit!

504
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,470
It's okay.

505
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,590
You can't get me now.

506
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,610
I have a roof.

507
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,150
That's fucking right.

508
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,850
I have a fucking roof.

509
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:34,970
What you gonna do now?

510
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,850
Okay.

511
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,870
Have you tried the door?

512
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,650
Hello?

513
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,870
Knock knock?

514
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,210
Please open this door, sir.

515
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,950
I swear, I'm not dangerous.

516
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,470
Like, yes, there's a dead body out there.

517
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,570
But that wasn't me.

518
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,870
That wasn't me.

519
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,690
That dead body.

520
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,790
That could be any...

521
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,670
He was dead before I got here.

522
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,650
Oh, wait.

523
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,650
There's invincibility.

524
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,310
If I...

525
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,710
Did you guys see that?

526
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,110
I didn't get hurt because I was opening the chest.

527
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,390
The chest invincibility.

528
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,370
How the fuck do I...

529
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,710
Do I hit the door?

530
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,950
Open up.

531
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,830
Knock knock.

532
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,310
Knock knock.

533
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,650
Guys, open the door.

534
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,970
The man was dead already when I got here.

535
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,790
It wasn't me.

536
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,190
I swear to God.

537
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,710
I did not kill this man.

538
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,450
He just...

539
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,250
He died from a heart attack.

540
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,510
I swear to God.

541
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,490
I swear he died from a heart attack.

542
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:49,870
Alright.

543
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,830
Alright.

544
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,850
Oh.

545
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,490
Guarded the gate?

546
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,030
Oh, shit.

547
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:57,930
Oh.

548
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,270
Alright.

549
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,230
Oh.

550
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,750
Oh, shit.

551
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,010
Wait.

552
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,490
That's...

553
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,130
Yes.

554
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:04,970
They know magic?

555
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,750
Fucking rats.

556
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,150
Alright.

557
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,010
I'm gonna kill this rat.

558
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,030
That's right.

559
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,290
What's your magic gonna do?

560
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,970
Against my... Oh.

561
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,690
That.

562
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,950
That's right.

563
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,850
But what's your magic gonna do?

564
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,170
Now.

565
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,110
Oh, shit.

566
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,510
Okay.

567
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,110
Okay.

568
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,870
But like...

569
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,630
But like... Okay.

570
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,030
Now.

571
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,850
You can't do jack shit.

572
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,710
Oh, shit.

573
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,290
Okay.

574
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,950
Guys, his magic is pretty strong.

575
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,630
Guys.

576
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,530
Oh, my...

577
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,010
Oh, my God.

578
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,250
Okay.

579
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,970
Guys.

580
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,250
Guys, his... his baby's here too.

581
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,130
Oh.

582
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,090
Oh, my God.

583
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,770
Why are these rats so strong?

584
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,710
What the fuck were the wolves doing?

585
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:46,990
Like, what...

586
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,290
What were the wolves fucking doing?

587
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,510
So, like, I saw the text worked.

588
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,010
Okay.

589
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,830
So... Oh, shit.

590
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,110
Okay.

591
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,070
I... Never mind.

592
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,810
It's so fucking weird.

593
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,570
Okay.

594
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,710
It's okay.

595
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,190
Bye.

596
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,250
I will use baby if I have to.

597
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,030
Alright.

598
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,530
Nice.

599
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,130
Rat dead.

600
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,170
That's the least of my worries.

601
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,830
Oh, hey.

602
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,330
Turtle!

603
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,330
Hello, turtle.

604
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,490
Why...

605
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,730
What the fuck is this level scaling?

606
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,570
The powers.

607
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,870
Oh, shit.

608
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,110
Oh, shit!

609
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,790
Oh, shit!

610
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,970
Does he have two heads?

611
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,370
What the fuck?

612
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,690
You fucking freak!

613
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,810
You fucking freak!

614
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,170
You fucking freak!

615
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,410
Okay.

616
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,330
Even your mother doesn't love you.

617
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,070
Look at you.

618
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,350
Your mother didn't even give you fucking clothes.

619
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,930
Look at you.

620
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:45,990
Your mother didn't even give you fucking clothes.

621
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,570
Oh, my god.

622
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,650
Oh, and then, you know what?

623
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,450
Let's give you...

624
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,470
Okay.

625
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,830
Okay.

626
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,390
I don't think I like Sad Land.

627
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,190
I...

628
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,790
Holy shit.

629
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,530
Oh, my god.

630
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,130
Guys.

631
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,330
I'm gonna fuck this.

632
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,950
Just for this one rat guy.

633
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,570
Just for him.

634
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,790
I will...

635
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,950
use my power up.

636
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,850
Jesus Christ!

637
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,690
Oh, my god!

638
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,330
This isn't even a baby!

639
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,210
That's the worst part!

640
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,550
He's just a regular guy!

641
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,070
Okay.

642
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,670
A regular guy with two heads, but still.

643
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,670
Aw, fuck this.

644
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,950
That's fucking right.

645
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,630
I have fire repellent now.

646
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,010
Can't be jack shit.

647
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,030
I don't care about you I messed up every single of my utilities and all my HP.

648
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,030
Oh, my god.

649
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,190
This is a lesser Yao Guai, too.

650
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,710
He's a rat captain!

651
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,870
Upon side by side.

652
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,850
Oh, my god.

653
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,070
And he still breathes fire!

654
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:04,930
Oh, shit!

655
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,650
Alright.

656
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,330
Now I know.

657
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,670
Now I fucking know.

658
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,710
Okay.

659
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,710
This is awkward because now I have no HP.

660
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,110
Oh, these are like shortcuts!

661
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,290
I have to open on the other side.

662
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,170
Oh, no, no.

663
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,270
That's not a shortcut.

664
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,310
That's...

665
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,510
What's wrong with this guy?

666
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,070
That's his dad?

667
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,730
Who did he bang?

668
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,590
He's here!

669
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,910
Go away!

670
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,370
I don't know...

671
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,010
This is a secret or something.

672
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,050
WHAT IS THIS?

673
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,590
I think it's a secret.

674
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,650
So far...

675
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,110
Modern solutions.

676
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:19,430
Modern problems require modern solutions.

677
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,380
That's me!

678
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,140
Oh

679
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,280
shit!

680
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,180
Um...

681
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,300
Wait!

682
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,380
What if I just walk...

683
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,760
Oh no...

684
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,200
I have accepted my fate.

685
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,480
How did you hurt yourself?

686
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,500
How did you hurt yourself?

687
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,740
I'm standing still!

688
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,020
I'm standing still!

689
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,000
He fucking hurt himself!

690
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,560
How did that happen?

691
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,160
How did that happen?

692
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,440
I needed to fucking...

693
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,240
Guys, I don't have heals!

694
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,060
I don't have magic!

695
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,540
I needed to die there!

696
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:37,980
I needed to die there!

697
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,680
There was no way!

698
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,800
I had to die there so I could...

699
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:44,960
I had to die there so I could...

700
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,200
I had to die there so I could...

701
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,640
Fuckin' reset everything.

702
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,140
Alright, let's see.

703
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,580
I need to figure out how to get back there.

704
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,740
Should be this way.

705
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,940
Okay, I don't really care.

706
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,300
I'm just gonna run past everything.

707
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,900
Also, is the volume up better?

708
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,640
I know, like, the Chinese dub is, like, a little bit quieter than the English dub.

709
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,360
Alright, there you go.

710
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,840
I have zero heals, guys!

711
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,620
I wasted it all.

712
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,800
I wasted it all.

713
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm gonna get the... the dad.

714
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
Okay, I'm not gonna...

715
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,360
Oh, shit!

716
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,820
I'm sorry, I won't fuckin' kill your dad.

717
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,400
I'm sorry.

718
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,580
Baby.

719
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,680
And then...

720
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:26,880
Boom!

721
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,220
And then...

722
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,460
That's fuckin' right.

723
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,480
Fire!

724
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,740
Fire!

725
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,000
Fire!

726
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,380
Fire!

727
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,940
That's fuckin' right.

728
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,420
I forgot how to play this game.

729
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,360
This is not good.

730
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,080
How am I...

731
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,720
Oh, it's cuz...

732
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,340
It's cuz of the dad.

733
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,040
What if I'm just...

734
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,760
Where's the dad?

735
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
Where the fuck did the little guy go?

736
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,920
Wait, I hear him.

737
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,900
What?

738
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,020
Where is he?

739
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,640
I...

740
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,160
Okay.

741
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,760
He's, like, super slow.

742
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,060
His moveset is, like, incredibly slow.

743
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,120
Alright.

744
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,220
Where... Where is the little guy?

745
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay.

746
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,880
Alright, that's...

747
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,300
Oh!

748
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,700
I don't even know what you're doing!

749
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,780
He's got a K Pain.

750
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,460
I don't even know what you're doing!

751
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,140
How do you even know he's your dad?

752
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,260
I mean, look at you two.

753
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:28,620
All I'm saying is if you look at these two together, like I don't know.

754
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,340
I wanna know how to fuck those two.

755
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,560
He was able to do that.

756
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,620
And get that.

757
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,280
Okay.

758
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,600
Death Throwing Rocks is literally self defense.

759
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:43,760
FRIENDS!

760
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,880
Oh god.

761
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,440
Okay.

762
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,480
Come on.

763
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,320
Come on!

764
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,320
Bro!

765
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,880
Stop!

766
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,220
Oh god.

767
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,460
Oh god.

768
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,580
I need a fucking...

769
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,500
Oh there he is!

770
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,820
He's so tiny!

771
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,380
It's so hard to see!

772
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,060
Oh shit!

773
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,740
The worst part is that it's so tiny that I can't even fucking see!

774
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,980
Oh my god.

775
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,720
You have...

776
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,640
Now I know why you were like this.

777
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,400
Jesus!

778
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,220
Oh my god!

779
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,600
Please!

780
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,920
Have mercy!

781
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Have mercy!

782
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,060
Are you serious?!

783
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,360
That hit me?!

784
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,300
Okay.

785
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,740
That's fucked.

786
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,460
That's actually fucked.

787
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,920
That's actually fucked.

788
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,400
Oh...

789
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,720
I didn't realize that would hit me.

790
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,720
The dad better be like one hit or some shit.

791
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,160
Like...

792
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,800
How are you so tanky?!

793
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,200
You're just a little guy!

794
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,800
Oh fucking hell.

795
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,260
Oh my god, bro.

796
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,380
Fuck you.

797
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,800
No, I'm getting rid of you.

798
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,820
Your son's not gonna help you now.

799
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,940
Your son is not gonna help you now.

800
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,200
Your son doesn't even know you exist now.

801
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,060
Your son got fucked.

802
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,820
Your son got fucked.

803
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,780
Your son...

804
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh

805
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,270
no.

806
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,730
No he ain't...

807
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,470
He...

808
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,930
What?!

809
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,290
Oh!

810
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,310
I should not have killed the fucking father!

811
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,070
I'm so sorry!

812
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,910
I'm so sorry!

813
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,910
Oh shit!

814
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,350
Guys!

815
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,190
Don't kill the dad first!

816
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,970
He does not like it!

817
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,010
Oh my god!

818
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,610
Guys!

819
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,170
Do not kill the dad first!

820
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,350
He...

821
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,770
For some reason he was not happy that his father died.

822
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:58,950
I...

823
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,950
Alright.

824
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,730
Alright.

825
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,550
Now we know.

826
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,190
Now we...

827
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,590
It was a good learning experience chat.

828
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,910
Now we fucking know that dad gets angry.

829
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,370
Son gets angry.

830
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,170
Why would he be so angry?

831
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,290
I don't understand.

832
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,630
Why would he be so angry?

833
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,010
Oh my god!

834
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,910
What the fuck?

835
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,170
He traveled all the way...

836
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,870
He traveled all the way here.

837
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,130
I wanted to get rid of the subtitle thing because we don't have words yet.

838
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,310
I wanted to get rid of the subtitle thing because we don't have words yet.

839
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,690
Alright.

840
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,170
Let's go this way.

841
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,070
Alright, here we go.

842
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,510
Yeah, is the volume a lot better now?

843
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,050
I don't think sound guy is awake at this time.

844
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,670
So...

845
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,930
I know I adjusted it a bit more.

846
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,010
Alright.

847
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,310
That's like so fucked.

848
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,050
Yeah, it's just his dad.

849
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,970
No big deal.

850
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,730
Like I don't...

851
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,230
How the hell was I supposed to know?

852
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,370
Dad, it hurts.

853
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,250
Alright.

854
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,410
Oh shit.

855
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,710
Don't worry.

856
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,090
Fire.

857
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:16,970
Fire.

858
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,250
Okay.

859
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,550
You know what?

860
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,170
Maybe no fire.

861
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,630
Alright, son!

862
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,530
I just wanna say.

863
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,850
Your head issue.

864
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,890
Maybe you should stop using your head.

865
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,610
Maybe you should stop using your head for fucking... Oh my god!

866
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,230
Okay.

867
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:40,970
Not gonna lie.

868
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,790
A lot of his issues could be solved if he doesn't...

869
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,510
If he doesn't bash his head on the floor.

870
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,310
Like, I don't know.

871
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,910
It seems like a very simple solution.

872
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,950
Oh boy.

873
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,030
Oh my god!

874
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,590
But it's okay.

875
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,550
You don't have to listen to me.

876
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,950
Just listen to your dad!

877
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,030
Oh yeah.

878
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,470
No.

879
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:01,890
No.

880
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,390
Okay.

881
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,050
It's not okay.

882
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,370
Stop using your head during fights!

883
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,030
Your dad not taught you that!

884
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,310
It would be so...

885
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,830
This is why you have head issues!

886
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,990
This is why your head hurt!

887
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,430
And they also know they're giant fucking rats!

888
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,350
Okay.

889
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,230
Alright.

890
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,430
Alright.

891
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:31,930
Don't worry.

892
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,670
Ow.

893
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,910
That is not fair.

894
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,130
Oh shit!

895
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:37,530
Okay.

896
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,270
Okay.

897
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,850
I hope the dad doesn't get angry.

898
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,250
Like...

899
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,030
I can't believe I get...

900
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,430
Oh!

901
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,550
Okay.

902
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,730
Oh my god!

903
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,490
Oh my god!

904
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,190
I can't...

905
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,470
He's so ungebunga that I can't predict him!

906
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,130
That's the worst part!

907
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,590
He's like...

908
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,830
He has no brain!

909
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,930
He has no strength!

910
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,590
He's literally just...

911
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,830
I walk and then I hit!

912
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,710
I don't know how to deal with him!

913
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,930
He has no brain!

914
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,550
Alright.

915
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,230
Here we go.

916
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,590
Alright.

917
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,470
Now I know my immobility is like not...

918
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,510
Are you serious?

919
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,410
Are you serious?

920
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,290
Okay.

921
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,290
Oh god.

922
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:33,710
Okay.

923
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,430
Oh please!

924
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,850
I'm stuck inside him!

925
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,590
I'm actually...

926
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,970
I'm stuck!

927
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,550
Oh my god.

928
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,070
This is actually not fair.

929
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,690
Okay.

930
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,930
Alright.

931
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,910
This dad's gonna fucking do that shit again.

932
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,230
Oh god.

933
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,830
Alright.

934
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,590
Oh.

935
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,310
Oh my god.

936
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,310
What are your patterns?

937
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,950
Please.

938
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,250
No!

939
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,960
Okay.

940
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,460
Oh my god.

941
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,180
No!

942
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,020
I ran into that!

943
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,460
Oh.

944
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,760
Why am I so stupid?

945
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,140
Alright.

946
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,500
Nice!

947
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,340
Oh thank god!

948
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,920
His son is dead!

949
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
That's right.

950
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,180
You raised that kid for 20 years and I killed him.

951
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,880
That's fucking right.

952
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,440
I killed your son!

953
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,420
That's 20 years wasted!

954
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,560
There we go.

955
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:13,380
There we go.

956
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,060
Nice!

957
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,780
Did I kill both?

958
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,900
I wonder what would happen if I did kill both.

959
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,080
I wonder.

960
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,380
I wonder if we could find his head too.

961
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh my god.

962
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,820
I used all my resources there.

963
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,380
He literally had like unga bunga strength.

964
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,220
What?

965
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,500
I'm gonna miss the Scottish accent right after.

966
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,710
Yeah!

967
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,250
There was double lines!

968
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,070
Oh my god.

969
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,530
Sorry.

970
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,010
Oh my god.

971
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,870
My voice fucking died there.

972
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,910
Holy shit.

973
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,290
My god.

974
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,410
The rat.

975
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,470
The rat fucked me up man.

976
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,110
Bro.

977
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,190
Oh please.

978
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,950
Why?

979
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,270
I will use this.

980
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,750
I cannot be bothered.

981
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,590
Holy shit.

982
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,250
I can't deal with this right now.

983
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,370
I already got ginseng.

984
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,010
Okay nice.

985
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,530
Let's go.

986
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,390
Let's fucking go.

987
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,530
Where do I go?

988
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,930
There has to be an incense somewhere.

989
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,770
Oh my god.

990
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,010
Where am I?

991
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,430
How is there more?

992
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,050
Oh god.

993
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,570
There's too much sand.

994
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,050
There's too much fucking sand.

995
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,470
Oh.

996
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,890
Turn back.

997
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,210
There's a shrine.

998
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,510
Oh there it is.

999
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,270
Oh thank god.

1000
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,010
Thank you.

1001
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,630
Thank you fairies.

1002
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,070
For finding me the shrine.

1003
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,310
Thank you.

1004
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,250
Oh my god.

1005
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,890
I needed it.

1006
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,110
Oh.

1007
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,190
Thank god there's a shrine.

1008
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,370
Thank god there's a shrine.

1009
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,270
I can brew.

1010
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,370
What did I get?

1011
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,690
I got.

1012
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,150
Oh.

1013
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,770
Increased damage reduction.

1014
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,210
I got.

1015
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:50,210
Oh.

1016
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:50,210
Increased damage reduction.

1017
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:50,230
Yes.

1018
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,090
I feel like there's no.

1019
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,670
There has not been any use for poison.

1020
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,730
Do I have new weapons yet?

1021
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,130
No.

1022
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,150
It's still that stick.

1023
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,410
Okay.

1024
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,150
Craft armor.

1025
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,830
Oh I didn't craft it yet.

1026
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,730
I found four silk.

1027
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,370
Okay.

1028
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,170
The back wind will attack enemies nearby.

1029
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,010
The destined ones and the decoys continuously.

1030
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,050
Oh.

1031
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,750
Oh.

1032
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,640
The decoys can attack.

1033
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,460
Thank god.

1034
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,680
I'm getting more of the Wukong strength.

1035
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,900
Okay.

1036
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,200
Yes.

1037
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,300
Okay, now I can make another one.

1038
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,140
Uh.

1039
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,300
Deals additional damage.

1040
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,320
Plus twelve.

1041
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,400
Encounter surrounding back attack will attack enemies nearby.

1042
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,860
Wait but.

1043
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah but that thing already does it.

1044
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,080
I already have that that does it.

1045
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,340
So, yes, okay.

1046
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,080
We should get this one, because we already have that.

1047
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,000
Does it stack?

1048
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,460
It doesn't say it stacks though.

1049
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,720
No set, no three set.

1050
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,740
Oh, you need three?

1051
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,920
Oh, fuck.

1052
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,240
Okay.

1053
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,440
I don't have three.

1054
00:39:59,500 --> 00:39:59,700
Okay.

1055
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,880
All right.

1056
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,660
Oh, that's not fair.

1057
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,900
I don't have enough silk.

1058
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:07,660
No!

1059
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,000
I don't have enough silk!

1060
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,840
I didn't get enough!

1061
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,880
Increases after a moment.

1062
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,400
God damn it!

1063
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,480
It has additional damage to it.

1064
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,540
Okay, we got it.

1065
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,060
Might as well.

1066
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,460
We might as well...

1067
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,880
I'm just gonna grab this then.

1068
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,860
Do I have enough?

1069
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,260
No.

1070
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,920
Oh, wait, I do.

1071
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,920
Oh my gosh.

1072
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,680
Guys.

1073
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,060
I'm a little special.

1074
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,160
I woke them all back at back seaters.

1075
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,700
Oh, I can buy silk!

1076
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,360
I can finally buy silk!

1077
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,420
Oh my god.

1078
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,660
They finally stocked up on silk.

1079
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,060
They answered my prayers.

1080
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,640
All right, let's rest up.

1081
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,300
We finally have enough money to purchase the silk.

1082
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,500
All right.

1083
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,920
Water...

1084
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,460
All right.

1085
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,880
So for those who don't know the story.

1086
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,740
I talked about the story a little bit.

1087
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,320
I thought... Originally, I thought the... Oh, shit!

1088
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:22,620
Okay.

1089
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,540
Okay, we're gonna... Actually, we're gonna deal with...

1090
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,960
We're gonna deal with the arrow guys first.

1091
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,800
That's right.

1092
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,780
I can come... Wait... Wait... Wait a minute.

1093
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,420
Wait a minute.

1094
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,740
You mean I can't kill you?

1095
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:37,820
You?

1096
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,700
You mean my stick?

1097
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:39,880
How?

1098
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,060
What's the point of using a stick if it's not fine?

1099
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,840
What do you mean I can't just kill you?

1100
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,500
Why is my stick not long enough?

1101
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,880
I can't jump!

1102
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,840
Wait, I can?

1103
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,400
Wait, how jump?

1104
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,840
Oh my god.

1105
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,740
Guys.

1106
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,760
Guys.

1107
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,120
I...

1108
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,980
It's a jump buddy?

1109
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,800
This game has not taught...

1110
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:29,000
This fucking game has never said anything about the jump buddy.

1111
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,520
What?

1112
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,600
Now?

1113
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,340
Now it tells me that jumping exists.

1114
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,620
Are you kidding me?

1115
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,700
It never told me about the jump buddy.

1116
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,520
Wait, is that the dad?

1117
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,300
Hello, I killed your son.

1118
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,740
All I'm saying, dad, is that...

1119
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,640
Your wife is gone anyway.

1120
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,900
Oh shit.

1121
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,420
What the fuck is he doing?

1122
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,520
Forest Prince?

1123
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
You have tooth?

1124
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,500
How do you manage to fucking get this son?

1125
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,380
Bro, who the fuck did you fuck?

1126
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,440
He must have good bed game.

1127
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,900
Like, what the fuck?

1128
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,690
Well.

1129
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,350
Alright.

1130
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,770
Bye, dad.

1131
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,710
He was a terrible father anyway.

1132
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,710
Hey guys.

1133
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,450
He literally locked up his first son.

1134
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,670
Bart Simpson style.

1135
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,430
In the basement.

1136
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,170
Like, that's not a good dad.

1137
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,130
.

1138
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,610
That's awkward.

1139
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,850
He locked up his fucking son, man.

1140
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,870
In the basement.

1141
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,390
And then he fed him his own blood?

1142
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,230
That's not dad of the year.

1143
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,990
Alright, anyway, let's fight him.

1144
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,090
Hello!

1145
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:29,950
Baby!

1146
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,690
Alright.

1147
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,300
Okay, just get this over with.

1148
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,560
Just... just punch me.

1149
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,280
Just...

1150
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,240
Just...

1151
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,600
I don't think this is the run.

1152
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,200
We have to restart here.

1153
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,360
I...

1154
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,100
I figure after that, a restart was in order.

1155
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,560
After that, I think...

1156
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,920
I think we had to restart the run.

1157
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,660
I don't know how!

1158
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,660
How did I miss?

1159
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,320
Are you fucking...

1160
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,360
Bro, please!

1161
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,420
Oh, please, man.

1162
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,040
I just...

1163
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,820
I just wanna fight the other big baby.

1164
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,120
The baby rat.

1165
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,260
Let me fight the baby rat.

1166
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,960
He has nothing to live for.

1167
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,820
He's been a basement rat for his entire life.

1168
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,640
He has no education.

1169
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,000
He has nothing to live for.

1170
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,380
We gotta put him down.

1171
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,340
He literally ate his father.

1172
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,040
He's a catapult now.

1173
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,800
Nobody can fix him.

1174
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,660
He's literally a catapult.

1175
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:00,940
Oh, fuck it.

1176
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,040
I don't care enough for this.

1177
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,200
Alright.

1178
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,120
It's time to fight.

1179
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,660
It's time to fight the other big baby rat.

1180
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,400
Alright, this time.

1181
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,260
My very first time fighting him.

1182
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,140
I know that's weird that there's no, like, intro or anything, you know?

1183
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,160
Like...

1184
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,720
This is the first time I see this guy and there's no intro.

1185
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,320
I wonder...

1186
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,140
It's so weird, guys!

1187
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,660
First time fighting him and there's like no intro?

1188
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,360
I wonder why.

1189
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,900
I wonder why.

1190
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,020
I wonder why.

1191
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,860
I wonder why.

1192
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,520
I wonder why.

1193
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:42,640
I wonder why.

1194
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,200
Oh my god.

1195
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,780
I wonder why there's no intro, guys.

1196
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,820
Oh, shit.

1197
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,180
Alright.

1198
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,780
Yeah, I think I got...

1199
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,840
I think I experienced my first glitch today, guys.

1200
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,800
Oh, shit.

1201
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,400
Alright, nice.

1202
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
I've definitely experienced my first glitch.

1203
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,940
I wonder...

1204
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,260
Oh, I wonder how he got here.

1205
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,100
This random rat in my game.

1206
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,760
This lucky random rat in my game.

1207
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,860
What's his story?

1208
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,120
Oh, man.

1209
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,160
I wonder...

1210
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,880
He looks just like that other rat I killed.

1211
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,480
I guess I'll never know.

1212
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,820
I guess I'll never know.

1213
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,800
Nice.

1214
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,220
Oh, no.

1215
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,040
My...

1216
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,280
He's so low!

1217
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,600
Yeah, this random...

1218
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,540
Oh, this must be like...

1219
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,100
Like those...

1220
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,620
It's like Dark Souls.

1221
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,160
Like those optional bosses that like...

1222
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,600
There's no intro or anything.

1223
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,200
It's like...

1224
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,540
Holy fuck!

1225
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,740
Big Baby was not happy!

1226
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,040
Oh, shit.

1227
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,240
Okay.

1228
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,540
The double dodge.

1229
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,140
Oh, god.

1230
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,580
Please.

1231
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,420
Oh, god.

1232
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,600
Oh, my god.

1233
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,800
He is so tanky.

1234
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,000
All right.

1235
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
I'll do this.

1236
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,220
And then...

1237
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,340
Oh, no.

1238
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,920
I don't have magic anymore, guys.

1239
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,140
I don't have magic anymore!

1240
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,280
Oh!

1241
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,220
And then the double...

1242
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:30,740
No!

1243
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,440
He slaps after that!

1244
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,580
No!

1245
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,960
Okay.

1246
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,500
The tail.

1247
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,380
Come on!

1248
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:38,700
Come on!

1249
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,020
Come on!

1250
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:39,920
Yes!

1251
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,260
Easy!

1252
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:41,400
Oh, my god.

1253
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:41,600
Easy!

1254
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,840
First try!

1255
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,860
We finally destroyed the bloodline.

1256
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,760
That's right.

1257
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,600
There's no way.

1258
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,060
He couldn't even comprehend what the fuck was going on.

1259
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,400
There's no way he made children.

1260
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,880
There's no break his knees.

1261
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,360
All right.

1262
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,020
The royal family of flowering sands.

1263
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,160
A foolish son.

1264
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,120
A clever father.

1265
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,460
One plan went ahead.

1266
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,620
The other, rather.

1267
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,480
On the battlefield, no room for kin.

1268
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,500
The father flees, leaving his son within.

1269
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,980
Favored by the king, was a renowned warrior for his valor in the battles.

1270
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,800
He was grat...

1271
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,560
But later, a shadow darkened his mind, clouding his reasons, erasing his memories of kin.

1272
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,820
Thus, he was hidden away.

1273
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:22,240
Oh!

1274
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,380
He used...

1275
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,780
What the fuck happened to him?

1276
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,420
Two of his...

1277
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,280
Two of his sons yet remained?

1278
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:35,950
Oh, shit!

1279
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:37,350
Okay.

1280
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:38,170
So...

1281
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:39,450
So...

1282
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:40,870
Um...

1283
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,770
So, there's still one more son.

1284
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:45,650
There's...

1285
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,030
There's still...

1286
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:46,730
Is that him?

1287
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,390
Which one's the son, and which one's the dad?

1288
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,030
I can't even tell!

1289
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,790
Is this the son, or is this the...

1290
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,230
I mean, he was like...

1291
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,550
I feel like this is the dad.

1292
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,810
This has to be the dad.

1293
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,330
Oh my god!

1294
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:04,050
Who did he bring?!

1295
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,530
Like, what did he possess to make these children?

1296
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,230
No, I think this is...

1297
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:14,530
This is...

1298
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,230
This is the father.

1299
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,570
We all saw what he looked like.

1300
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,250
That sub was like five times his size, guys.

1301
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,410
That dad has the most insane riz.

1302
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,350
Like...

1303
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,230
To be able to...

1304
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,690
To be able to, like, produce those sons.

1305
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,890
Oh my god.

1306
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,750
Alright, let's see.

1307
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,950
Well, we killed...

1308
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,730
We killed the rat family.

1309
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,750
Just one more son left.

1310
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,650
I finished the job.

1311
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:52,310
I'm skinny!

1312
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,670
I'm failed!

1313
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,910
Lord, Jesus Christ.

1314
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1315
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,070
Thank you, thank you, Bray.

1316
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,070
What is this?

1317
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:06,930
Bless her.

1318
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,950
A blaze bone.

1319
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,670
On the road, bare bones on display.

1320
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,630
Blood shrouded, decayed.

1321
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,750
Long gone, forgotten name.

1322
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,350
His homeland lost in death's name.

1323
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,270
Alright.

1324
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,740
Let's see.

1325
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,760
God, is there extra loot anywhere?

1326
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:29,980
Oh!

1327
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,580
Ugh!

1328
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,060
Oh my god, who lives here?

1329
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,020
What the fuck?

1330
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,060
What did I get?

1331
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,120
Oh, I got wine!

1332
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,080
Wait, I can upgrade my wine now!

1333
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,120
Nice.

1334
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,560
Yoink!

1335
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,120
Stole your treasure.

1336
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:58,560
Whoever lives here was like, man, although my life fucking sucks, at least I have this wine that cost my entire life savings to buy.

1337
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,960
Surely nobody's gonna rob me.

1338
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:14,840
Surely this would be a safe spot and no one will ever find this little hole here and take my entire life savings.

1339
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,040
There's no way.

1340
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:22,820
Alright.

1341
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,580
Let's go up.

1342
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,460
Oh my god, after learning how to jump, everything changed.

1343
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,880
Everything changed for me.

1344
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,120
Alright.

1345
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,180
Hello!

1346
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,140
Hello, sir!

1347
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,720
You can only shoot once and then that's it.

1348
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,060
I learned.

1349
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,620
I don't even know if I'm going the correct way anymore.

1350
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,260
I...

1351
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,080
I don't...

1352
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,820
I don't know.

1353
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,500
Hello?

1354
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,220
What is there?

1355
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,260
What's that?

1356
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,380
Oh, Batman!

1357
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,800
Oh, shit!

1358
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,720
Batman's strong!

1359
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,260
Who would have thought?

1360
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,200
Who would have thought?

1361
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,520
No, it's Man-Bat.

1362
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:12,880
Sorry.

1363
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,580
Man-Bat.

1364
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,220
Oh my god.

1365
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,060
Man-Bat, go back to your billionaire cave!

1366
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,660
Okay.

1367
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,100
Oh, shit!

1368
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,980
No, he slapped me!

1369
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,080
Okay.

1370
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,560
Nice.

1371
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,500
Man-Bat.

1372
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,280
Man-Bat down.

1373
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,460
Man-Bat down.

1374
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,520
The shallow sea, the backwater lies.

1375
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,780
Far from clamor under the sky.

1376
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,880
In moonlight, hues, blood it sips.

1377
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,980
Through yellow wind, it slips.

1378
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:42,540
Alright.

1379
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,260
The rent is heavy.

1380
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,040
Oh my god, they have to pay rent?

1381
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,900
Bro.

1382
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,640
The rent is heavy.

1383
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,800
Burden on us.

1384
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,620
Is there any pos...

1385
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:52,880
No!

1386
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,040
Man-Bat has to pay rent!

1387
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,800
No!

1388
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,980
Not even caves are safe from real estate?

1389
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,820
That's fucked.

1390
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,880
Oh my.

1391
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,580
Too real.

1392
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,460
Poor Man-Bat.

1393
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:15,620
He has to pay rent even in this god awful cave that he lives in.

1394
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:17,900
Damn.

1395
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,480
Not even in ancient China are you safe from rent.

1396
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,340
Oh, shit.

1397
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,360
Is that Man-Bat's soul?

1398
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,440
Why the fuck would I use Man-Bat?

1399
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,440
I have the baby.

1400
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,560
Oh, it is.

1401
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,540
It is Man-Bat.

1402
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,620
How much square feet is that?

1403
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:44,060
I mean, seems like it has a nice view.

1404
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:44,600
Look.

1405
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,740
You get to look out into the...

1406
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,000
Oh my god, there's an outside backyard.

1407
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,440
That seems so bad.

1408
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,000
There's an outside backyard.

1409
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,880
Can't be that bad.

1410
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,600
Wait, then what's this?

1411
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,920
Is this like another secret tunnel?

1412
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,600
Secret tunnel.

1413
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,260
Oh my god.

1414
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,000
This is...

1415
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,280
How is this... Oh no.

1416
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,760
There's more Man-Bats.

1417
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,120
How is there so many bats?

1418
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,820
Where do I go?

1419
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,180
Twelve... This is like twelve million dollars.

1420
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,600
This is actually like an exclusive place in... Oh, Crouching Tiger Temple.

1421
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,960
This is an exclusive place in New York City.

1422
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,040
It's called the Cave Experience.

1423
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,580
And it actually goes for like fifty million dollars.

1424
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,320
That's actually a steal.

1425
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,040
It actually goes for like five hundred million dollars.

1426
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,900
Because it is like a gated community within the cave system.

1427
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,100
And each little crevice you get, it's like an experience.

1428
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,700
You know?

1429
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,780
It's very immersive.

1430
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,840
It's like insight into like back to the prehistoric times.

1431
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,480
So you get to live like how your ancestors did in the past.

1432
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,140
It's called experience, guys.

1433
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:26,860
You know how like Airbnbs have those things now where at Airbnbs there's like there's like those special Airbnbs.

1434
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,960
I know like there's one where they made it like Edna modes from the Incredibles.

1435
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,400
There's like one where you can rent out Edna modes mansion and then they decorate it as if it's like the Incredibles and everything.

1436
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:46,020
And so like you can actually rent out like some like experience Airbnbs.

1437
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,240
Yeah!

1438
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,220
There is!

1439
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:47,940
You guys didn't know?

1440
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,880
Alright, sorry.

1441
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:59,160
Okay, Airbnbs unique, unique I was watching like there was like a video about it.

1442
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,100
Um...

1443
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,040
and it's like basically like unique Airbnbs.

1444
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,500
Okay, cool cool unique Airbnbs world.

1445
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:16,300
They have the most unique Airbnbs.

1446
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,480
There's one where you get to sleep in the tower above the sea.

1447
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,540
Like you sleep like there's like a house above the sea and you can like live there for a night.

1448
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,860
And there's an igloo one too.

1449
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,720
I think there's one that was like based off of like the Marvel Universe.

1450
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,280
Oh yeah!

1451
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,700
There's like, there's a bunker.

1452
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:42,040
You can literally rent out an Airbnb apocalyptic bunker for $700 a night.

1453
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,660
Like you can It's like what the fuck?

1454
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,360
You can like sleep at a fucking bunker.

1455
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,380
Like

1456
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,740
There's like some really cool ones.

1457
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,160
I was like what the fuck?

1458
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,360
Wait I need an Alright.

1459
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,540
Tucked away design.

1460
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:04,880
Yeah!

1461
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,800
And you can design an incredible.

1462
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,800
Look at this.

1463
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:13,360
You can actually design like an incredible super suit there too.

1464
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,680
So like I think they like give you an incredible super suit right after.

1465
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,740
From there.

1466
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,620
Tucked away.

1467
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,780
Closed behind gates.

1468
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,400
Like that's so fucking insane.

1469
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,380

From May Oh guys you can't anymore.

1475
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,980
May to June.

1476
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,240
Yeah but like for some special days.

1477
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,660
It actually I thought that was actually crazy.

1478
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,260
Yeah it's actually real.

1479
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,960
I saw a video of the end of mode one.

1480
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:03,480
Um But yeah they have some crazy Airbnbs listed there.

1481
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:07,620
I didn't realize you can actually rent out like Airbnb experiences.

1482
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,680
Yeah!

1483
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,720
The house from up!

1484
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,080
What do you mean house from up?

1485
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:15,840
It's a cartoon!

1486
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:21,380
They literally made the house from up with the balloons and everything as an Airbnb.

1487
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,800
You must have signed some.

1488
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,520
Also like knowing Disney.

1489
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,100
Like I don't know if you should sign those waivers though.

1490
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,540
Because that seems like an insane safety concern.

1491
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,680
Like knowing Disney.

1492
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,980
Those waivers must be insane.

1493
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:49,640
Those safety waivers must be not very good.

1494
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,600
So I don't think you should sign.

1495
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,360
It looks cool.

1496
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:01,920
But like I don't think you should sign any fucking safety waivers from Disney for a while.

1497
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,500
Or like any TOS from them.

1498
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,960
You know they took that out?

1499
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,540
They finally took it out because of the controversy.

1500
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,080
I can't believe they put that in.

1501
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,840
It blew my mind that they actually put that.

1502
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,280
Oh my god!

1503
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,680
Wait there's little rats!

1504
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,860
What's the difference between the little rats and the big rats?

1505
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,140
Oh shit!

1506
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:25,960
He slapped me!

1507
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,520
Oh shit!

1508
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,700
They bow slapped me!

1509
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,260
Fight him!

1510
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,420
Fight!

1511
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:30,840
Fight!

1512
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,360
Fight!

1513
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:31,760
Fight!

1514
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,300
Are they fighting him?

1515
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,240
I can't tell if they are!

1516
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,580
Oh god.

1517
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,460
Okay.

1518
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,580
I actually have to use my magic because there's so many bats.

1519
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,600
And I don't trust myself with all these bats.

1520
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,000
With all these man bats.

1521
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,300
Alright let's see.

1522
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,220
Is that it?

1523
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,080
They were guarding?

1524
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,460
These better be some fucking good ass mushrooms.

1525
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,500
They're guarding this.

1526
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,540
Oh no!

1527
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,100
There it is!

1528
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,880
That's what they were actually guarding.

1529
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:04,940
Alright.

1530
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,020
That's right.

1531
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,860
Maybe I'm the bad guy.

1532
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,260
Could I be the bad guy and stealing their life savings?

1533
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,480
No.

1534
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,580
They're bad people so I'm allowed to do this.

1535
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,520
Maybe that was self defense.

1536
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,500
Because clearly I'm like a home invader, right?

1537
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,480
No.

1538
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,900
I must have killed thousands of people.

1539
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:29,780
I'm doing a good thing.

1540
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,560
I'm the neighborhood watch.

1541
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,660
I'm the neighborhood watch.

1542
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:40,900
I'm the neighborhood watch.

1543
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,680
This is self defense.

1544
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,860
I might have been invading their home.

1545
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,580
But this is self defense guys.

1546
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,440
To be fair.

1547
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,840
To be fair, Shroom Hong is not a very good person.

1548
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,680
Well to be fair, he's a monkey.

1549
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,220
He doesn't need a follow rules.

1550
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,040
He's a fucking monkey.

1551
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:06,960
He doesn't need to follow any rules made by humans and gods.

1552
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,240
He's not a very good monkey.

1553
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,140
He's a murder monkey.

1554
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,380
He's basically like Kratos but like monkey.

1555
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:21,040
And like he's doing it more so for fun.

1556
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,720
Less so for like revenge.

1557
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,800
Because he's always been an asshole.

1558
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,420
He's always.

1559
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,340
I mean he did have like his redemption arc and journey to the west afterwards.

1560
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,460
But like he started out as an asshole.

1561
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,020
He's He's just been born an asshole.

1562
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,900
He just enjoys it.

1563
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:49,980
Alright.

1564
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,160
Alright.

1565
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,480
Let's see.

1566
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,560
Nice.

1567
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,260
Come on.

1568
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,700
What is this?

1569
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,360
Can I steal that too?

1570
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,080
No.

1571
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,020
Oh it's a Buddha's offering.

1572
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,140
But a monkey.

1573
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,700
A monkey.

1574
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,280
Alright.

1575
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:12,920
Guys.

1576
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,980
Do you think the staircase filled with blood means that there's something bad up ahead?

1577
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,480
No.

1578
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,220
It's just Halloween.

1579
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:23,780
No.

1580
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,500
Maybe it's just close to Halloween guys.

1581
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,000
Haha.

1582
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,560
Oh my meditating again?

1583
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,420
Where is the third son?

1584
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,380
I killed so many rat babies too.

1585
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,520
I must kill the third to end the bloodline.

1586
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,740
Where is he?

1587
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,940
Would my bloodlust ever be satisfied?

1588
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,920
Oh I keep living and killing babies from different species.

1589
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,140
When will monkey find love?

1590
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,420
Oh hey, sparks!

1591
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,280
Alright.

1592
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:07,580
Alright.

1593
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,540
Nice.

1594
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,720
Okay, more stuff.

1595
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,940
Look, he's just acting out.

1596
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,720
He's lonely.

1597
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,560
He's acting out.

1598
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:28,380
He has no, he has no girl, no girl monkey in his life.

1599
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,760
He's so lonely.

1600
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,980
When will monkey find love?

1601
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,840
What about y'all, those human girlfriends?

1602
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,500
It's not the same.

1603
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,680
They don't know how to do that monkey thing.

1604
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,100
Okay, we are great.

1605
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,700
Upgrade our guy.

1606
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,680
Alright, let's see.

1607
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,760
Let's see.

1608
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,100
This one ain't even Wukong.

1609
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,140
I feel like he must be like a clone or something.

1610
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:12,840
You know, like a hair strand of Wukong or like, I feel like he could be like one of the hair strands because that's happened before.

1611
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:25,580
In the, in the Wukong like adaptations and storylines where like one of his like, hair, hair, hairline like, um, like diverged and created his own life or something.

1612
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,620
I should upgrade my stances.

1613
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,040
I feel like I don't.

1614
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,480
Each hand, oh wait, upon a charge attack, we should have that.

1615
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,580
And then...

1616
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:43,540
I feel like it could be either his hair or like a descent, like one of his son's sons or something.

1617
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,900
Because like, I'm pretty sure fucking he banged.

1618
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:56,880
I'm pretty sure there's no way.

1619
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,800
Yeah, Wukong had a lot of Riz.

1620
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:03,660
All right, let's see.

1621
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,940
I feel... oh, nope.

1622
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,100
What do I upgrade?

1623
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,400
Increases critical hit.

1624
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,820
The four banes effect.

1625
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,340
Maybe I should... I don't feel like stamina is an issue for me.

1626
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,860
I feel like it's more so maybe just get more damage or something.

1627
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,960
Upgrade your dodge.

1628
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,580
Let's see.

1629
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,800
Increase charge.

1630
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,280
Oh, I get the thrust.

1631
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,840
Is the thrust better?

1632
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,800
All right, guys.

1633
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:43,740
Now that it's been a day, clearly I should have had people... people can backseat me now.

1634
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:44,800
Clearly.

1635
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:45,640
Wait.

1636
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,080
I do like the smash stance.

1637
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,840
I feel like... is the thrust better than the smash?

1638
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,880
Thrusting is good.

1639
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:04,860
Now that we all had, like, a day to process this game, the meta must have been developed already.

1640
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,960
Like... Okay, thrust stance is good.

1641
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:12,180
Allows to charge upon releasing.

1642
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,380
All right, let's try the thrust.

1643
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,740
See what that's like.

1644
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,100
Okay.

1645
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,370
Okay, that's not it.

1646
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,110
I just realized I used the wrong one.

1647
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,990
All right.

1648
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,410
Okay,

1649
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:38,470
that's thrust.

1650
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:38,950
Okay.

1651
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,590
All right, that's thrust.

1652
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,550
All right, we figured it out.

1653
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,130
Oh, hey, there's a togger.

1654
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,850
Is he drinking blood?

1655
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:50,930
Blood?

1656
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,540
What are you talking about?

1657
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:54,380
Blood?

1658
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:56,980
Blood?

1659
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,380
Blood?

1660
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:57,440
Blood?

1661
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,240
Bleedy hell.

1662
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:58,900
Hahaha!

1663
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,540
Guys, I don't think he... I think this tiger's British.

1664
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:05,460
Hahaha!

1665
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,040
Oh, my God!

1666
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:12,540
It's the cat!

1667
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:13,800
I'm gonna kick the cat!!!

1668
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,100
Oh, my God!

1669
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,520
We're gonna get the trifecta!!!

1670
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:26,800
Howая Ahaha Oh E slap!

1671
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,020
We're gonna grab the trifecta, guys!

1672
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,920
We're finally gonna punch the cat!

1673
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,820
This is what we wanted!

1674
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,760
Finally!

1675
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,600
From baby to dark, the cat!

1676
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,840
Will anybody stop her?

1677
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,200
Nobody can stop me now!

1678
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,700
That's fucking right!

1679
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,880
Yeah, I punched the cat!

1680
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,800
Come on, get over here!

1681
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,860
That's fucking right, get over here!

1682
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:05,560
Boom!

1683
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,560
Oh shit!

1684
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,380
Nice!

1685
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,100
Oh shit!

1686
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,100
Oh, I'm sorry!

1687
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:09,900
Oh!

1688
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,140
That's a wrestling cat!

1689
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,040
Why do they all wrestle?

1690
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,380
Okay, no, he's just punching me.

1691
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,180
No, that's just martial arts.

1692
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,740
Wait, what?

1693
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,840
What the fuck?

1694
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,620
He has tornado powers?

1695
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,260
He also can use the wind?

1696
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,460
Oh god.

1697
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:33,700
Oh, dodge!

1698
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,480
Oh shit!

1699
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,580
Dodge!

1700
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,600
Alright, nice, I dodged.

1701
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:39,820
Freeze!

1702
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,240
That's fucking right.

1703
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,560
That is so fucked!

1704
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,080
Come on!

1705
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,940
That is so not fair!

1706
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,140
What the fuck?

1707
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,280
Why did you get to...

1708
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,220
No, no, no, no, no!

1709
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:52,960
No, no, no!

1710
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:53,540
No!

1711
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:54,040
No!

1712
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:55,840
Okay.

1713
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,840
Oh my god!

1714
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,800
Okay.

1715
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,860
Oh my god!

1716
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:10,360
Oh my god!

1717
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm only halfway?

1718
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:16,900
Oh, no.

1719
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,380
Oh my god, I'm only halfway.

1720
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,960
I'm alread- I don't even have- Oh!

1721
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,980
I don't even have my... any more magic.

1722
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,200
What do you mean I'm only halfway?

1723
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,630
I hate you.

1724
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,650
I fucking hate you.

1725
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:41,370
Are you fucking... I hate you.

1726
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:47,000
I hate you so much.

1727
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:49,500
Boom.

1728
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,580
That's fucking right.

1729
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,300
Don't touch me.

1730
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,360
Oh no.

1731
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,960
This guy is harder than Big Baby.

1732
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:06,290
It's harder than Big Baby.

1733
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,990
I only got halfway.

1734
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,410
This guy has... Who is he?

1735
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,790
I just want to finish the trifecta.

1736
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,530
Wait until you meet him.

1737
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:26,310
There's more.

1738
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,370
Oh my god.

1739
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,330
Oh, I already looted that.

1740
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:35,070
I already... Oh my god.

1741
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:40,770
Bro, this is what happened to Tony the Tiger after he retired?

1742
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:43,810
After he retired.

1743
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,350
This is him now.

1744
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:49,930
Oh, that's not fair.

1745
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,270
Do you feel old yet?

1746
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,950
This is what happened to Tony the Tiger.

1747
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:55,790
Do you feel old yet?

1748
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,850
Do you feel old yet?

1749
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,450
Alright, alright.

1750
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:09,450
After he retired from being Vtuber he needed to do this to...

1751
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,390
to lay out there.

1752
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:16,190
Jesus.

1753
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,270
Oh my god.

1754
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:21,970
What?!

1755
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:25,030
And you remember like when he does that?

1756
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,450
Oh my god.

1757
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:28,790
Please.

1758
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:34,010
Frosted Flakes are great!

1759
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:41,810
He realized... Oh no, this is why we feed him Frosted Flakes.

1760
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:43,410
If he knows...

1761
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:49,370
If he realized that someone gave Tony the tiger!

1762
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,770
He was raised up to be a vegetarian!

1763
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,350
But then he realized what meat actually tastes like!

1764
01:12:59,530 --> 01:12:59,710
Oh no!

1765
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:03,850
This is why we don't feed Tony the tiger real meat!

1766
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,970
Guys, we fucked up!

1767
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,530
We introduced Tony to real meat!

1768
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:14,990
Oh god.

1769
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,370
Okay.

1770
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,050
There you go.

1771
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:22,990
That's fucking right.

1772
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,290
Nice.

1773
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,950
Alright.

1774
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,170
Oh, I just dodged a tap.

1775
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,370
Oh god!

1776
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,310
Oh god!

1777
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:40,930
Again!

1778
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,970
Oh shit!

1779
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,210
Okay.

1780
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,050
Okay, nice.

1781
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,430
There you go.

1782
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,190
Oh god, here you go.

1783
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,370
Alright, nice.

1784
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,090
Bye.

1785
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:03,750
Oh shit!

1786
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:04,370
He got me!

1787
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,410
No!

1788
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:12,430
I'm trying to remember his stances, but it's so... Oh shit!

1789
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:15,110
He just punches back!

1790
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:23,290
He just punches back!

1791
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:25,690
Oh no!

1792
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,050
I'm dead!

1793
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:28,990
I'm so classed!

1794
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:32,430
I'm slowly figuring out his stances!

1795
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,070
Boy, it's hard!

1796
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:34,910
Bro, he...

1797
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,990
He's not supposed to punch back!

1798
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:42,510
He just slacked me like a fly!

1799
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,010
He's like, get away monkey!

1800
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,230
Oh my god.

1801
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,450
I'm sorry, Tony the tiger.

1802
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,890
Guys, this is why we don't...

1803
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:03,890
This is why we don't feed Tony meat!

1804
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:09,970
We kept it on a strict vegetarian diet his entire life!

1805
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,250
And now he knows!

1806
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,050
He knows what he missed out!

1807
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,930
Now he's...

1808
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:20,270
Now he's angry!

1809
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:21,110
Hiya!

1810
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:21,650
Hiya!

1811
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,350
Hiya!

1812
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:30,650
Boom.

1813
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:31,550
Oh god.

1814
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:35,530
That's fucking right.

1815
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:36,090
Boom!

1816
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,690
You didn't expect that, did ya?

1817
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,310
Oh shit!

1818
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:43,670
He did a little dance there.

1819
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:45,290
Boom!

1820
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:46,510
Boom!

1821
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:47,990
Boom!

1822
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:49,650
Alright, there you go.

1823
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:53,730
Poke!

1824
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:54,450
Alright.

1825
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:01,030
I know that stance.

1826
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:03,350
Nice.

1827
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:06,010
Oh shit, I forgot the second... the third attack!

1828
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:09,810
Poke!

1829
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:10,570
Oh!

1830
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,370
Alright, nice.

1831
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:18,730
The hard part is just remembering all his move combos.

1832
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,150
He has too many moves!

1833
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:22,730
Ah!

1834
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:23,590
Fuck!

1835
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:24,030
Okay.

1836
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,750
I need to hydrate.

1837
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,590
Remember to stay hydrated!

1838
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,830
Remember to stay hydrated, everybody!

1839
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:34,490
Okay.

1840
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,070
Oh!

1841
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:35,830
Fuck!

1842
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,130
Okay.

1843
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:37,870
Nice.

1844
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:38,530
Not nice.

1845
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,050
Not nice.

1846
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,430
Not nice.

1847
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:42,110
Poke!

1848
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:45,010
I can do that again.

1849
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,050
Oh!

1850
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:47,530
Fuck!

1851
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:48,190
Oh!

1852
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:48,730
I'm sorry!

1853
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:49,470
I'm so sorry!

1854
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:52,330
Oh!

1855
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:53,130
What?!

1856
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:08,390
I can't believe it!

1857
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,730
I did so well!

1858
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,410
How did I time it wrong?!

1859
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,190
No.

1860
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,290
No way!

1861
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:27,570
What is that?!

1862
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,630
I was doing so well!

1863
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:33,510
Oh my gosh!

1864
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:41,630
I hate that when he gets on the stone, the stone part, like, the lock on stops.

1865
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,490
It's not fair!

1866
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:52,370
Stupid-ass clone!

1867
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:53,810
It's not fair!

1868
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,750
Cloning is like a monkey thing!

1869
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,270
How dare you!

1870
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,550
Cloning is for monkeys only!

1871
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,970
It's not fair!

1872
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,230
Alright.

1873
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,170
Oh, he moves so fucking fast.

1874
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,250
Jesus Christ.

1875
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,990
This is exa... Oh!

1876
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:19,830
Fuck!

1877
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,430
There we go.

1878
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:22,530
No!

1879
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,010
I fucked it up!

1880
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:27,210
Oh no!

1881
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,330
I hope that is one move.

1882
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:30,810
Okay.

1883
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:31,590
Alright.

1884
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,130
I need like...

1885
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,250
Okay.

1886
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:36,650
Alright.

1887
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:38,510
Just need to know that.

1888
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,230
Okay, I need to regenerate stamina.

1889
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,130
Regen... Poke?

1890
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:46,410
Poke.

1891
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,010
Get closer so I can poke.

1892
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:48,610
Poke!

1893
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:49,630
Nice.

1894
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:51,850
Alright.

1895
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:54,090
Okay.

1896
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:55,430
No!

1897
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:55,550
Oh!

1898
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,880
Smack you in the ass!

1899
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,980
Wait, I forgot to use baby!

1900
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,740
Almost forgot big baby mode!

1901
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,080
Alright.

1902
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:09,600
Nice.

1903
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,720
Oh my god.

1904
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,480
I can't believe I almost forgot big baby mode!

1905
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:22,780
Okay.

1906
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,280
There you go.

1907
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,220
I got that dodge correctly.

1908
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:27,540
Okay.

1909
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:27,760
Nice.

1910
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,080
Okay.

1911
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:36,480
There we go.

1912
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,200
Jesus Christ.

1913
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:41,800
No!

1914
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:42,640
No!

1915
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,240
I saw it too!

1916
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,600
I saw it!

1917
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,860
I am out of my groove!

1918
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,800
I fucked with my groove!

1919
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,140
No!

1920
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,520
I was doing so well too!

1921
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,200
I fucked with my groove!

1922
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,740
Oh no.

1923
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,660
Oh no.

1924
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,280
Oh no.

1925
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:13,760
No!

1926
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,440
No!

1927
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,280
I can't get the timing!

1928
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:25,440
Actually, that one clone move messed me up so bad!

1929
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,720
Why is she hitting the decoy?

1930
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,720
It's cuz like...

1931
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:43,960
It's cuz like, if I hit the decoy at the right time, he just does that one punch, which I can dodge.

1932
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,560
I can dodge that punch.

1933
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,260
Like, before he like, runs away.

1934
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:54,700
But like, if I get the timing off, then like, I'm fucked.

1935
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,780
If I get the timing off, it's like, everything's fucked.

1936
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:00,940
It's over.

1937
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:08,380
God, please.

1938
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:09,760
How?

1939
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,420
Wait, what?

1940
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,420
Wait, my fucking...

1941
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,740
Big baby!

1942
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,460
I got it down in time.

1943
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,340
Oh!

1944
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:26,680
Okay.

1945
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,120
Missed.

1946
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,300
Haha, you missed, loser.

1947
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:30,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

1948
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,820
I'm sorry for calling you a loser.

1949
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:33,860
I'm sorry.

1950
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:34,380
No!

1951
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,200
He got stuck in the wall!

1952
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:38,340
Ah!

1953
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,260
Every time!

1954
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:44,700
Okay.

1955
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,880
Come on, get closer.

1956
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,980
You know you want to.

1957
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,680
Come on.

1958
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:49,920
That's right.

1959
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,960
That's fucking right.

1960
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,320
Bam!

1961
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,900
Oh god.

1962
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,400
Oh.

1963
01:21:59,340 --> 01:21:59,900
No!

1964
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,420
Fuck!

1965
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,860
I need to time that when he does the jump!

1966
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:04,860
No.

1967
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,540
I can't!

1968
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,120
Why must you jump?

1969
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:13,740
Boom.

1970
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,200
No!

1971
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,360
No!

1972
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,420
Okay.

1973
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,560
Guys.

1974
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,460
Tony the Tiger.

1975
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,020
Is too strong.

1976
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,400
Stop teaching Tony the Tiger martial arts!

1977
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,020
See?

1978
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,280
Like when he does that I can dodge it.

1979
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:40,660
Very easily.

1980
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:41,840
Aww.

1981
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,960
But I can't dodge that.

1982
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:45,760
Boom.

1983
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:46,200
Alright.

1984
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,220
I can dodge this at least.

1985
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:49,620
Guys.

1986
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,320
I don't think this is it.

1987
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:51,880
Guys.

1988
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,140
I don't think this is the run.

1989
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,480
This is not the run.

1990
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:56,860
Guys.

1991
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:57,900
This is not the run.

1992
01:22:59,080 --> 01:22:59,480
Okay.

1993
01:22:59,480 --> 01:22:59,620
Okay.

1994
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,140
Guys, I'm not even halfway and I don't have HP anymore.

1995
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,200
I don't even have HP.

1996
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:09,720
No!

1997
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,360
No!

1998
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:10,980
No!

1999
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,540
No!

2000
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,200
Okay.

2001
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,260
Please,

2002
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:27,810
Tony.

2003
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,190
We're worried about you, Tony!

2004
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:32,110
No!

2005
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,010
I dodged it!

2006
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:34,810
This is the first time I've ever dodged it!

2007
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:37,530
No!

2008
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:37,990
No!

2009
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,110
It's not fair!

2010
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:39,710
I was in the air!

2011
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,910
I've never dodged it before!

2012
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:51,690
Guys, I'm so happy that, like, I did all of that and I'm dead.

2013
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,030
He's kicking my ass!

2014
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,070
He's actually kicking my ass!

2015
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:05,310
Oh my god, I was supposed to kick the cat, but the cat's kicking me!

2016
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,850
Oh, Tony the ass-kicker!

2017
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:14,970
Tony, please!

2018
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:17,150
We need you back on cereal!

2019
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:20,850
Tony, they're great!

2020
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:24,790
Tony, please!

2021
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:27,830
We need you back on the cereal!

2022
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:29,530
Tony!

2023
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,110
We can't have you representing me!

2024
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,010
What would the children think?

2025
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:39,910
Think, baby!

2026
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,910
Okay.

2027
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:44,610
Okay.

2028
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:46,430
There we go.

2029
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:49,550
There we go.

2030
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:49,770
See?

2031
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:53,870
If I get him instantly, it's so much easier to dodge!

2032
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,150
Got it!

2033
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:57,310
Got it!

2034
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,330
Jesus!

2035
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:05,630
Okay.

2036
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,790
Here we go!

2037
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,890
Go!

2038
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,230
That was on me!

2039
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,530
I deserve that!

2040
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:19,350
I 100% deserve that!

2041
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:24,530
I don't know why I thought I could cancel it!

2042
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:27,750
I got a little too cocky there!

2043
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:31,090
I was like, oh, but what if I cancel that?

2044
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:34,530
What?!

2045
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,550
How did his break mine?

2046
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:39,890
Oh, no.

2047
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:40,910
Oh, no.

2048
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:42,510
Okay.

2049
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:43,330
Alright.

2050
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:44,850
The very first time.

2051
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:47,010
Okay.

2052
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:48,130
Alright.

2053
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:50,050
No!

2054
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:50,770
I tied!

2055
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:53,990
Okay.

2056
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:54,950
Alright.

2057
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,250
Nice.

2058
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:57,110
No, he has the second punch!

2059
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,750
Nice.

2060
01:25:58,850 --> 01:25:59,290
Alright.

2061
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,770
Where is... What?!

2062
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,990
Okay.

2063
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,370
That wasn't fair.

2064
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:09,190
That was not fair.

2065
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:11,930
Oh my god!

2066
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:13,630
Why?!

2067
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,290
Why are you like this?!

2068
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:20,510
Who gave a tiger a sword?!

2069
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,450
Here he is!

2070
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:23,490
He has all the advantages in the world!

2071
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:32,570
Why did you give him more?!

2072
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:32,610
Why did you give him more?!

2073
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,010
What?!

2074
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:40,690
I don't understand!

2075
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:43,390
He already has everything!

2076
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:45,830
Why even a sword?!

2077
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,950
Why even a sword?!

2078
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,050
Oh, no.

2079
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:49,790
Oh, no.

2080
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:50,390
Okay.

2081
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:50,610
Okay.

2082
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:54,910
Guys, look at my HP.

2083
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:55,390
I don't...

2084
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:56,030
It's over.

2085
01:26:59,370 --> 01:27:02,890
Why win when you can win more?

2086
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:10,090
After six and a half hours!

2087
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:11,430
Wait!

2088
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,170
Cactus won!

2089
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,090
It's too late!

2090
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,110
I saw it!

2091
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,050
What do you mean?

2092
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:24,590
After six...

2093
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:26,870
I saw it!

2094
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:27,810
It's too late!

2095
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:32,790
I fucking saw it!

2096
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:34,570
It's too late!

2097
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,070
Oh my god.

2098
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,770
What do you mean upgrade my weapon?

2099
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,250
How the fuck do I upgrade my weapon?

2100
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,550
How the fuck do I upgrade my weapon?

2101
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:49,430
The power of frosty flakes.

2102
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:50,190
The power of frosty flakes.

2103
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:52,490
I can't...

2104
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:53,570
I can't...

2105
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:55,270
I saw it!

2106
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:01,110
Oh my god.

2107
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,510
Oh my god.

2108
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,410
I can't upgrade shit!

2109
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,490
What do you mean?

2110
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,710
Am I under level?

2111
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:15,270
Am I fucking under level?

2112
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:18,830
Did I fucking freeze through this too fast?

2113
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,150
Did I fucking freeze through this too fast?

2114
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:23,610
There is no new stat!

2115
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:24,910
What do you mean?

2116
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:26,990
What do you mean?

2117
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:27,890
Alright.

2118
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:32,490
Honestly, if I'm under level, it makes sense.

2119
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:32,950
Honestly, if I'm under level, it makes sense.

2120
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:36,830
I will not be surprised if I was under level.

2121
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:36,990
I will not be surprised if I was under level.

2122
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:37,550
Not gonna lie.

2123
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:46,650
I will not be surprised.

2124
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:47,950
That's for sure.

2125
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:50,410
Alright.

2126
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,750
Okay.

2127
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:53,990
Nice.

2128
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:56,750
Okay.

2129
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:58,250
Alright.

2130
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:00,890
Come on.

2131
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:02,070
You gotta get close to me, right?

2132
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:03,510
Boom!

2133
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,910
That's fucking right.

2134
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:07,930
Alright.

2135
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:08,590
Oh!

2136
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,390
The third flash!

2137
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:09,750
No!

2138
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:10,750
The first flash!

2139
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,790
Oh god.

2140
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,430
Oh no!

2141
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:17,490
My groove!

2142
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:21,610
Bam!

2143
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:22,770
That's fucking right.

2144
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,590
Oh shit!

2145
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:25,850
Okay.

2146
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:26,270
Thank god.

2147
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:26,530
Okay.

2148
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,030
I dodged that.

2149
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:28,510
Oh!

2150
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:29,850
I dodged that!

2151
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,710
Come on.

2152
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:36,770
Oh, thank you.

2153
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:39,170
Whoa!

2154
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,230
No!

2155
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:42,610
Oh god.

2156
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:42,910
Okay.

2157
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:44,050
That's fine.

2158
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:44,410
No.

2159
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,310
That's fine.

2160
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:46,250
No!

2161
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:46,830
That's not fine.

2162
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:47,270
No!

2163
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:48,150
He's in my corner!

2164
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,590
He got me in the corner!

2165
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:53,450
It's not fine in the end.

2166
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:54,210
It was not fine.

2167
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:56,610
Oh no!

2168
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,730
I deserve that.

2169
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:00,670
Oh!

2170
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,370
I 100% deserve that.

2171
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:05,230
Okay.

2172
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:09,490
No.

2173
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,150
No.

2174
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,910
Oh!

2175
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,730
I dodged it!

2176
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,490
I got it!

2177
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,480
Fair!

2178
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,040
Fair!

2179
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,660
Next time I'm gonna give him...

2180
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,480
Okay.

2181
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,060
Oh!

2182
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:35,640
Please!

2183
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,620
Oh thank god he didn't give him a gun.

2184
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,120
I'm glad he didn't get a gun.

2185
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:43,580
No!

2186
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,100
No!

2187
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,890
I might as well give him a gun!

2188
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:52,370
No!

2189
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,350
Even better!

2190
01:30:57,770 --> 01:30:58,570
Yeah!

2191
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,010
Oh my god!

2192
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,750
They might as well!

2193
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:09,030
They might as well give him a fucking gun!

2194
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:12,990
Oh my god!

2195
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:14,250
Oh!

2196
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:16,330
How do I upgrade my staff?

2197
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:22,210
I don't think I saw anything that allowed me to upgrade my staff.

2198
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:25,390
Wait.

2199
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:26,510
Where do you upgrade it?

2200
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:31,170
I'm sorry for never eating my Syria!

2201
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:33,870
Oh it's in the craft?

2202
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,110
This one?

2203
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:37,550
But like that's just a normal staff.

2204
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:43,770
I only have that.

2205
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,230
You're telling me I can't...

2206
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:13,400
Are you fucking serious?

2207
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,900
Are you fucking serious?

2208
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:26,220
Are you fucking kidding me?

2209
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:29,800
Are you fucking kidding me?

2210
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,420
God I hate everything.

2211
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,380
I'm so sad.

2212
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,860
I'm so sad.

2213
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:37,340
I'm so sad.

2214
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,780
I couldn't...

2215
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,160
I had a stronger staff!

2216
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,040
I...

2217
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,180
Okay.

2218
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,060
Alright.

2219
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,220
Okay Tony.

2220
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:52,920
I'm...

2221
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,480
I'm coming back Tony!

2222
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,980
I'm coming back Tony!

2223
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,180
That's a little awkward.

2224
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:06,200
Holy shit!

2225
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,020
I'm so fucking...

2226
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:10,020
I'm so fucking...

2227
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:10,300
mad!

2228
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,380
I'm so mad!

2229
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,460
I got...

2230
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,700
Guys I couldn't help it!

2231
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,540
The fucking Peta wins!

2232
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:30,180
The Peta winning got me!

2233
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,580
You don't understand!

2234
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,620
You don't understand!

2235
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,980
The Peta wins!

2236
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,280
The Peta wins!

2237
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,220
It was the Peta wins!

2238
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:47,540
It was the Peta wins!

2239
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,160
The Peta wins!

2240
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,180
The Peta wins!

2241
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:58,960
Oh my god!

2242
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,200
The Peta wins!

2243
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,160
Okay.

2244
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,740
What that hit me?!

2245
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,680
Oh fuck okay.

2246
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,180
What?!

2247
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:11,640
Okay!

2248
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:17,100
How did I become worse after getting a better upgrade?!

2249
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,020
How did I become...

2250
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:24,940
Oh my god!

2251
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:26,780
I...

2252
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,100
I upgraded and it threw off every saw in my pattern.

2253
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,200
After upgrading I don't know how to play this video game anymore.

2254
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,860
That's actually crazy.

2255
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,880
That's actually crazy.

2256
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,740
I already forgot the patterns.

2257
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:49,320
I can't believe I forgot the patterns!

2258
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,880
I forgot the patterns!

2259
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:55,460
Okay.

2260
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,420
Holy shit!

2261
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,640
This game is so much easier now!

2262
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:07,240
If I had the upgrade when I was at my peak!

2263
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:11,220
If I had the upgrade when I was at my peak!

2264
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,640
This is so bullshit!

2265
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,680
Oh my...

2266
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:30,370
Actually...

2267
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:34,490
I wasted

2268
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,480
so much time!

2269
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,680
I wasted...

2270
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,740
I actually...

2271
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,760
Wasted so much time!

2272
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:52,060
I wasted so much time!

2273
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:53,300
😠 😠

2274
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:05,820
I still keep doing a challenge run and she didn't even know...

2275
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,440
Aww!

2276
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,680
Sing me to sleep...

2277
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,620
I can be a rock now!

2278
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:26,080
I can be a rock!

2279
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,040
Alright.

2280
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,960
It's okay.

2281
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,240
I'm so sad.

2282
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:49,920
I legitimately could have fucking finished this so much earlier.

2283
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,780
You would have been dead.

2284
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:57,260
I turned into rock.

2285
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,170
Alright.

2286
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:09,810
I won on my worst run.

2287
01:37:09,970 --> 01:37:13,990
Wow Doki, it's so cool you gave the tiger a few chances before taking it.

2288
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:15,210
Take the clothes off.

2289
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,810
Yes, thank you in the super chat.

2290
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:19,070
Thank you, thank you.

2291
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:22,990
Alright.

2292
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:31,270
I won, but why doesn't it feel like I won?

2293
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:34,330
Why does it not feel like it?

2294
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:41,350
Guys, why doesn't it feel like I was winning?

2295
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:47,510
Alright, let's see.

2296
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:50,950
Let's get...

2297
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:53,090
Let's get this.

2298
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:56,790
Because we're always running anyway.

2299
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,890
We don't need HP.

2300
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:11,410
All in on the damage, baby!

2301
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:14,810
All in damage!

2302
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:18,710
Yeah!

2303
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:20,050
Damage!

2304
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:24,430
No HP only.

2305
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,930
I genuinely don't even think I need stamina.

2306
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:27,730
Not gonna lie.

2307
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:30,550
I feel like my stamina is like good enough.

2308
01:38:32,150 --> 01:38:33,210
Famous last words.

2309
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,170
Famous last words.

2310
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:42,030
Just don't get hit, Doki.

2311
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,170
Just don't get hit.

2312
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:45,430
It has to be like...

2313
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:47,270
A gift, right?

2314
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,460
There has to be like an increased stamina.

2315
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,440
Increased HP.

2316
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:56,600
Permanently gift.

2317
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:57,980
Around here.

2318
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,820
The fact that I won on my worst fucking run.

2319
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:01,300
That...

2320
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:09,660
Stick to cereal, Tony.

2321
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,740
Oh, there it is.

2322
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,080
Oh, I need to use stone.

2323
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:17,520
Oh, there it is.

2324
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,660
Alright, I need to use the stone.

2325
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,200
Alright, I need to use the stone.

2326
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:22,620
How do I equip it?

2327
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,000
Do I have to set the spells back at the shrine?

2328
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:28,440
Do I have to set the spells back at the shrine?

2329
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,340
Do I have to set the spells back at the shrine?

2330
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:31,500
Alright.

2331
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,380
Oh, it's another item?

2332
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:40,740
Oh, it's another item?

2333
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,120
Oh, I don't have the stone yet?

2334
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,720
Oh, I thought it was my magic.

2335
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:53,510
Oh, okay.

2336
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:58,110
Oh,

2337
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:01,790
I wish he was pa...

2338
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:05,890
You know, if he was playing that song while I was beating the shit out of the T ambul...

2339
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:08,310
Tony, I would have done even better.

2340
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,390
I wouldn't need the staff.

2341
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:12,570
That's all I'm saying.

2342
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:14,770
If he was there earlier.

2343
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,870
If he was singing during my fight.

2344
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,990
What?

2345
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:19,050
That would have actually been the first try.

2346
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:24,010
Let's see.

2347
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:28,910
No wonder people were yelling at me to craft.

2348
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:31,250
I was like, what the fuck do you mean upgrade my staff?

2349
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:32,790
There's no upgrades.

2350
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:39,390
Oh, I can't be bothered.

2351
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:48,370
It might be overkill, but honestly, it deserves it.

2352
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:57,070
I'm not really ready to deal with these guys normally.

2353
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,450
Monkey tired.

2354
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:01,070
Monkey wants to rest.

2355
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:04,830
Monkey knows.

2356
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:09,290
Monkey lost 50 years of Monkey's lifespan.

2357
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:14,670
Monkey desires retirement.

2358
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:17,670
Why do I have to save Wukong?

2359
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:22,890
Like, there's so many monkeys.

2360
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,410
Oh, but you're the chosen one.

2361
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:28,770
Like, can he choose many?

2362
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:32,690
Why did he only choose one?

2363
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:37,050
I feel like if I needed insurance, I was like, oh, there's...

2364
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:40,590
Every god in the world fucking hates me.

2365
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:46,610
Let me have one insurance monkey to bring me back if I die, like, again.

2366
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:47,490
If I...

2367
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:54,770
If I decided to be buried under a rock again for the 500 millionth time.

2368
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:57,310
Why would I have one monkey insurance?

2369
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:04,770
Why can't I be like the Horcruxes with like 500 monkeys gathering around trying to get the...

2370
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:06,970
Trying to get this fucking relic?

2371
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:11,050
I should be diversifying my assets.

2372
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:13,610
Monkey should be diversifying.

2373
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:13,850
Why?

2374
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:18,010
What happened to monkey together is strong?

2375
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:30,590
If I was Wukong, if I was Shroomhong and I've been stuck on the rock for the 500th time, and 500 million gods want to kill me, I would have just ripped a huge patch of my hair.

2376
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:32,090
And be like, be free.

2377
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,590
Be like...

2378
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,910
Just a giant...

2379
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:43,690
It'll grow back.

2380
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:45,230
The hair will grow back.

2381
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:47,650
Just rip a huge piece of hair.

2382
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:49,110
Be like, be free.

2383
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,450
Oh my god.

2384
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:58,950
The world...

2385
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:03,530
Everybody wants to kill me.

2386
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:04,150
Anyway.

2387
01:43:07,310 --> 01:43:07,870
Alright.

2388
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:09,310
Let's see.

2389
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:12,590
Why am I the chosen one?

2390
01:43:12,990 --> 01:43:14,290
It should be chosen many.

2391
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:16,790
Jesus Christ.

2392
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:18,410
Fucking get out of here.

2393
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:20,590
What?

2394
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:25,330
What do you mean that barely did jack shit?

2395
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:27,250
What kind of horse are you?

2396
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:29,310
Oh my...

2397
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:31,610
Okay, this horse is a little bit too strong.

2398
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:33,410
This is a strong ass horse.

2399
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:33,510
Okay.

2400
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,150
Holy shit.

2401
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:35,070
JK.

2402
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:37,650
You are nothing without your shield.

2403
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:39,810
What the fuck are you?

2404
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:40,770
The spear bone.

2405
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:43,210
The priests though were proud warriors.

2406
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:44,230
Okay.

2407
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:45,410
Oh, so they're priests.

2408
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:46,630
Kill the priest.

2409
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,630
That's not good.

2410
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:50,170
I mean, I'm already going to hell anyway.

2411
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:51,730
Wukong's definitely gonna go to hell.

2412
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:53,650
I mean, he has several times.

2413
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:54,310
So...

2414
01:43:59,150 --> 01:43:59,670
Very...

2415
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:00,470
I mean, he is immortal.

2416
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:01,970
So it's like...

2417
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:03,130
Oh, hey, chest.

2418
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:08,250
And you wonder why gods hate you.

2419
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:09,490
It's not my fault.

2420
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,330
If like...

2421
01:44:11,890 --> 01:44:13,290
Wukong's a little murder...

2422
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:13,910
Murdery.

2423
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:16,030
There's just too many gods.

2424
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:16,830
You know?

2425
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:18,040
Wukong had to like...

2426
01:44:18,570 --> 01:44:19,690
It was like...

2427
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:20,190
What?

2428
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,270
Why can't I gather this?

2429
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,830
It's because there's this guy here?

2430
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:25,870
Is that it?

2431
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,360
Yeah, Wukong...

2432
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,080
The reason why he's immortal...

2433
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,520
Is because...

2434
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:36,980
Um...

2435
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:39,200
There was like a bunch of peaches on the floor.

2436
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:40,760
And Wukong...

2437
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:42,040
Simhong was like...

2438
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:42,500
I'm hungry.

2439
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,360
And then he ate all the peaches.

2440
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,560
And now he can never die.

2441
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:48,240
And that's why the gods keep fucking trapping a rock under him.

2442
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:51,380
They're like...

2443
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:52,180
We can't...

2444
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:53,160
Oh, shit!

2445
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:54,820
They're like...

2446
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:55,700
We can't kill him.

2447
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:58,400
So we're just gonna put a really, really heavy rock.

2448
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,980
Like that's literally their strat.

2449
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:04,060
They're like...

2450
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,720
Alright, if we can't kill him...

2451
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,840
We're just gonna put a very heavy rock on top of him.

2452
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:10,940
And then...

2453
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:11,500
That's it.

2454
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,700
That's how we solve our problems.

2455
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,080
That's...

2456
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,160
That's actually...

2457
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:16,340
They're like...

2458
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:16,900
That's it.

2459
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,260
This is how we solve all our problems.

2460
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:22,900
Alright.

2461
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,500
Oh my god.

2462
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:24,140
Was that Splinter?

2463
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,340
Goodbye, Splinter.

2464
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:27,660
Oh, were you guarding that?

2465
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,920
Was that your life savings?

2466
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:29,480
He was like...

2467
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,240
It's okay.

2468
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:31,340
Even though I'm dead.

2469
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:34,360
At least I will forever have that one life savings.

2470
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,080
Yeah.

2471
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,140
He's also erased his name from the Book of Death.

2472
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,440
So he's like extra immortal.

2473
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:40,880
Yeah.

2474
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:41,820
That's why...

2475
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:42,500
That's what I'm saying!

2476
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,520
He knows he's fucking...

2477
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,900
He knows he's gonna be...

2478
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:47,980
The gods wanna trap him under that fucking rock.

2479
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,060
Then why is there one chosen monkey?

2480
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:52,920
That's what I'm saying!

2481
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,160
You should have more monkeys!

2482
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,120
There should be more monkey insurance at this point.

2483
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,440
There should be more monkey insurance.

2484
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,080
There's a chosen...

2485
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,260
But why does it have to be chosen one?

2486
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,360
It doesn't have to be!

2487
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:23,740
He didn't have to make it harder for himself!

2488
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:30,520
Boom.

2489
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,300
There you go.

2490
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,220
He thought one is enough.

2491
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:36,840
Yeah!

2492
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:38,660
After being trapped in the rock for the...

2493
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:41,100
For the 500th time!

2494
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,040
All right.

2495
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,520
Let's get these jars here.

2496
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,240
How many times is...

2497
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:47,500
Okay.

2498
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,160
To be fair.

2499
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,380
He's not known...

2500
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,200
I mean...

2501
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,840
He's like...

2502
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,300
He's...

2503
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:52,880
He's smart.

2504
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:53,720
But like...

2505
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,740
Also not really.

2506
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,640
Like sometimes he's very smart and then sometimes he's not.

2507
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,540
He's like...

2508
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:05,020
I could do the smart thing or I could do something really funny.

2509
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,820
I think he's like...

2510
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:09,960
He's sort of like me.

2511
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:10,660
I'll be like...

2512
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:14,400
I could do something that seems easy and smart to do.

2513
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:15,600
But then like...

2514
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,280
It won't be as funny though.

2515
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,140
It's...

2516
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,080
He's only monkey.

2517
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:21,880
Oh shit!

2518
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,720
Oh shit!

2519
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,480
He's like...

2520
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:24,880
Yeah.

2521
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:25,620
But like...

2522
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:26,540
Will it be funny?

2523
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,780
He would be a good streamer.

2524
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,940
If he was a streamer in our day...

2525
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:39,060
He would...

2526
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:41,760
He would 100%...

2527
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,420
He would 100% make so much money as a streamer.

2528
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:47,520
He'd be like...

2529
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:47,920
What?

2530
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,120
Hey Wukong!

2531
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,480
Today I'm gonna prank the guy!

2532
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,500
They're not gonna expect that.

2533
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,400
What would his fan name be?

2534
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,320
What would his...

2535
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,680
What would his fan name be guys?

2536
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:05,300
If he was a streamer?

2537
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,260
The monkey...

2538
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:10,920
Hey monkeys!

2539
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:14,760
Today we're gonna be pranking Erlang.

2540
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,920
He's not gonna expect it.

2541
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:21,000
The primates!

2542
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:21,760
Oh my god!

2543
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:22,040
Wait!

2544
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,040
The primates!

2545
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:26,200
The fellow primates!

2546
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,840
Oh my god!

2547
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,040
Wait!

2548
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,020
Primates are so good!

2549
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,780
Holy shit!

2550
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:37,880
I wish Wukong was a Vtuber so he can call his fans the primates.

2551
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:39,120
What?

2552
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:40,380
That's perfect.

2553
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:42,580
Alright.

2554
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,100
What the fuck?

2555
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:44,320
Okay.

2556
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:45,320
That's what it was.

2557
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:45,840
That's like...

2558
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,220
What the fuck is that sound?

2559
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,420
Who the fuck is like breathing heavily?

2560
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,480
I don't know.

2561
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:51,560
I don't know.

2562
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,820
I wish he was a streamer.

2563
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:56,760
Just kidding.

2564
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,660
So I'd be like...

2565
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,420
Hey primates!

2566
01:48:58,460 --> 01:48:59,640
Today we're gonna be...

2567
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:02,940
Alright.

2568
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,060
Let's see.

2569
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,000
Where do we go?

2570
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,600
This is just a dead village.

2571
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,720
What do I do at this dead village?

2572
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:14,840
Oh!

2573
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:15,980
Ow!

2574
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,180
That's not...

2575
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,100
That's very rude of you.

2576
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:19,840
That was so rude.

2577
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:22,840
Alright.

2578
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:23,180
Goodbye.

2579
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:24,980
I'm Sumong.

2580
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,200
I'm Sumong.

2581
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,860
And welcome to jackass.

2582
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:31,640
Okay.

2583
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:33,400
Thank you for the super chat Moose.

2584
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:33,760
Thank you.

2585
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,240
Thank you.

2586
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:41,790
Alright.

2587
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:42,170
Nice.

2588
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:42,890
What did I get?

2589
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:43,850
I got a core.

2590
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:46,070
Okay.

2591
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:46,550
I need a heal.

2592
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:49,930
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2593
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:53,110
I'll always be lost.

2594
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:54,730
I'll never be different.

2595
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:55,810
Okay.

2596
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:56,850
I need a heal.

2597
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:57,910
I feel like I...

2598
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:00,490
I definitely feel like I skipped a lot of bosses.

2599
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:02,530
Because I...

2600
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:08,650
I got so fucking lost that I feel like I skipped so many bosses getting here.

2601
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:11,930
No!

2602
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:12,630
Not him!

2603
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:15,110
Oh my god!

2604
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:17,090
The horse!

2605
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:19,690
That's so awkward.

2606
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:24,690
I used my fucking power up on the goddamn zombies.

2607
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,630
I'm so sad.

2608
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:28,090
Oh no.

2609
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:30,130
Okay.

2610
01:50:30,270 --> 01:50:31,470
It's time to send the baby in.

2611
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:34,270
Did I not hit a baby?

2612
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:35,390
Did I?

2613
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:36,330
Oh.

2614
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:37,350
Oh no.

2615
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:38,410
Oh no.

2616
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:39,950
Oh no.

2617
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:40,510
No!

2618
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:42,430
How did I roll back in?

2619
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:49,130
How did I manage to roll back in?

2620
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:51,270
Okay.

2621
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:52,630
Maybe I can...

2622
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:53,330
I can...

2623
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:54,810
Maybe I can cheese this.

2624
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:55,990
Maybe he's stuck.

2625
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:56,370
Okay.

2626
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:58,410
Okay.

2627
01:50:58,490 --> 01:50:58,710
Nice.

2628
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:00,990
Poke!

2629
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,150
Okay.

2630
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:03,290
We did it.

2631
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:06,010
Boom!

2632
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:06,750
All right.

2633
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:09,730
Oh, thank god cheese works.

2634
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:12,170
Oh, thank god.

2635
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:14,790
Oh, thank god.

2636
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:16,230
I love cheesing stuff.

2637
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:17,530
Oh.

2638
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:20,430
With the power of cheese.

2639
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:23,050
Cheese!

2640
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:24,590
Cheese!

2641
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:24,690
Cheese!

2642
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:25,030
Cheese!

2643
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:25,090
Cheese!

2644
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:25,250
Cheese!

2645
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:25,810
Cheese!

2646
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:26,250
Cheese!

2647
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:26,350
Cheese!

2648
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:26,850
Cheese!

2649
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:27,170
Nice.

2650
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:28,550
All right, off we go.

2651
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:30,930
Oh.

2652
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:32,090
Hey, there's something over here.

2653
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:35,010
Oh, no, that's just...

2654
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:36,730
It's just textures not loading.

2655
01:51:37,230 --> 01:51:39,410
I was like, what's that thing that's loading?

2656
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,280
You know, I'm almost, like, sure I'm home, except for the murdering part.

2657
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,560
What the fuck?

2658
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:54,460
Okay.

2659
01:51:58,390 --> 01:52:00,190
Oh, what the fuck?

2660
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:00,810
What the fuck?

2661
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:01,210
Oh my god.

2662
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:01,510
That's...

2663
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:03,250
THERE'S THREE OF THEM!

2664
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:06,750
Okay.

2665
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:09,270
Alright.

2666
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,610
THERE'S LIKE THREE OF THEM!

2667
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:12,470
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

2668
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:16,770
What you gonna do?

2669
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:18,030
Oh shit!

2670
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:19,730
Wait, he can cheese too!

2671
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:22,870
He fucking got me through the rock!

2672
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:24,570
Okay.

2673
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:27,030
Okay, it's fine.

2674
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:29,030
It's fine.

2675
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:29,670
He's stuck.

2676
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,510
Where did he go?

2677
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:37,430
Where did he go?

2678
01:52:38,230 --> 01:52:38,750
Where did he go?

2679
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,390
Wait, what the fuck?

2680
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:41,650
Where did he go?

2681
01:52:45,970 --> 01:52:46,490
What?

2682
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:47,070
What?

2683
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,520
Wait, what?

2684
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,260
Oh my god!

2685
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:56,480
Bro, did he spawn?

2686
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,370
There's how to do that?

2687
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:06,830
Oh my god!

2688
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:09,290
Bro can just de-spawn!

2689
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:11,550
Jesus Christ.

2690
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:14,170
That's actually fucked, man.

2691
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:18,630
That's so messed up.

2692
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:27,030
I swear to god, if you fucking de-spawn, I swear to god.

2693
01:53:32,410 --> 01:53:32,850
I swear to god.

2694
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:32,850
Oh.

2695
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:34,010
That's alright.

2696
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,750
Okay.

2697
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:38,570
No!

2698
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:39,130
No, no, no!

2699
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:39,570
Fuck!

2700
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:42,530
I don't have a lot of HP right now!

2701
01:53:44,070 --> 01:53:44,510
No!

2702
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:44,890
Come on!

2703
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:45,590
Where did he spawn?

2704
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:46,330
No!

2705
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:46,830
No, no, no!

2706
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:47,370
Oh god!

2707
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:50,210
Oh, I have to recharge!

2708
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,330
Oh, I have to recharge!

2709
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:53,670
Oh!

2710
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:55,690
Okay.

2711
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:55,770
Okay.

2712
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:57,010
Okay.

2713
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:00,110
Nice, alright.

2714
01:54:01,870 --> 01:54:02,430
No!

2715
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:04,890
I got one more!

2716
01:54:05,050 --> 01:54:06,230
I got one more in me!

2717
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:07,710
Okay.

2718
01:54:10,990 --> 01:54:11,830
Long stick.

2719
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:12,750
Boom!

2720
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:15,730
Nice.

2721
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:16,730
Oh, no!

2722
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:17,730
Come on!

2723
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:19,490
I got another in me!

2724
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:21,310
Oh, thank god.

2725
01:54:22,110 --> 01:54:23,650
Not even close.

2726
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:26,610
Not even close!

2727
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:29,110
And he gave me silk, too!

2728
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:31,970
Oh, my god.

2729
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:33,370
We're okay.

2730
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:35,750
We got the right imperial guard.

2731
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:38,030
Oh, my god.

2732
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:41,410
I can't believe I wasted so much HP.

2733
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:45,850
I wasted so much HP, too.

2734
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:47,390
That's the worst part.

2735
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:51,910
Where are the incense?

2736
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:56,910
Where the fuck am I supposed to heal?

2737
01:54:57,870 --> 01:54:59,110
Oh, it heals your back.

2738
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:00,730
Oh, that's how I was supposed to heal.

2739
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:03,430
That's how.

2740
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:04,830
Thank god.

2741
01:55:05,490 --> 01:55:06,650
Got a little worried there.

2742
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:09,370
I like how you're like, that's how.

2743
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:13,770
Alright, nice.

2744
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,950
Nice.

2745
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:21,350
It's actually crazy how easier the game got after you upgrade your staff.

2746
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:23,830
Guys, did you guys know you can upgrade your staff?

2747
01:55:24,070 --> 01:55:24,830
Fucking crazy.

2748
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:28,950
Crazy mechanic, guys.

2749
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:30,670
Never expected it.

2750
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:34,110
I just, I discovered it.

2751
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:36,850
Patented by Doki Bird.

2752
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:39,010
Damn.

2753
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:39,710
Yeah, isn't that wild?

2754
01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:45,820
Oh, hey.

2755
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,420
Invincibility gatter.

2756
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:48,700
Okay, never mind.

2757
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:49,960
It was not that invincible.

2758
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,480
That's gonna be like, oh shit, guys.

2759
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:55,800
Invincibility gatter.

2760
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,000
Let's go.

2761
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:02,360
Alright.

2762
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:06,960
Poke.

2763
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:11,840
That's fucking right.

2764
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:14,640
Guys, you think I don't know your zombies?

2765
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,240
Guys, I just killed like 500 of them.

2766
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:20,680
You think you're different?

2767
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,160
You'll be like, no, she'll not expect that.

2768
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:29,300
She expected all the other ones, but us three sitting there?

2769
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:31,520
She'll think we're actually dead dead.

2770
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,320
Alright, nice.

2771
01:56:35,620 --> 01:56:36,180
Okay.

2772
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,600
We got her.

2773
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,680
They're zombies, Doki.

2774
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:42,700
They can't comprehend thought.

2775
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:48,140
They don't know what's going on.

2776
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:49,500
Alright.

2777
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:50,880
Let's see.

2778
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,580
Can I go inside this house?

2779
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,320
There's an inside.

2780
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,700
I can see that there's an inside.

2781
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:00,340
It'll work one day.

2782
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,800
They clearly designed the inside.

2783
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:05,100
I should be let in.

2784
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:07,440
You can tell that they designed the inside.

2785
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,380
I should be let in.

2786
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:11,880
Okay.

2787
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:12,660
Wait.

2788
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:13,780
Oh, there it is.

2789
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:15,600
I was like, there has to be like an item here.

2790
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:17,560
There's no way that there isn't an item.

2791
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:20,880
Alright.

2792
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:21,340
Nice.

2793
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:22,580
Gold and silk.

2794
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:23,860
I always need more silk.

2795
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,220
Let me in.

2796
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:28,720
Let me in.

2797
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:31,280
Alright.

2798
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,000
Open sesame.

2799
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:37,460
Avelion.

2800
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,920
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

2801
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:39,340
Thank you.

2802
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:39,920
Thank you.

2803
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:44,350
Oh my God.

2804
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:44,810
Where do I go?

2805
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:47,410
Is there any extra?

2806
01:57:47,490 --> 01:57:48,330
Oh, there's hidden loot.

2807
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:50,350
Which I didn't see.

2808
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:52,630
I knew there was going to be more.

2809
01:57:52,630 --> 01:57:53,270
There's going to be hidden loot.

2810
01:57:56,050 --> 01:57:56,490
Nice.

2811
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:58,470
Alright.

2812
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:59,790
Up we go.

2813
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:02,370
Up the mountains I go.

2814
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:04,510
Wait.

2815
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:06,230
But like, what if I have to go down though?

2816
01:58:07,610 --> 01:58:08,050
Okay.

2817
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:10,290
But like, I know I have the option to...

2818
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:10,630
Oh, I...

2819
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:10,970
Yeah.

2820
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:12,230
We were supposed to go up.

2821
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:13,850
There's like literally nothing here.

2822
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:14,610
Unless...

2823
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:15,770
There's a little end in here.

2824
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:15,910
Oh.

2825
01:58:16,530 --> 01:58:16,970
Nope.

2826
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:17,790
That's just the scenery.

2827
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:18,910
Alright.

2828
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:19,770
Up we go.

2829
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:22,410
Oh.

2830
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:22,610
Oh.

2831
01:58:22,610 --> 01:58:23,790
There's the yellow paint.

2832
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:27,650
Oh my God.

2833
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:28,930
We finally got the yellow paint.

2834
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:31,950
We finally got the yellow paint guys.

2835
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:35,050
There it is.

2836
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,550
There it is.

2837
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:38,330
The yellow paint.

2838
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:45,610
They patch that just for me.

2839
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:51,110
After using plays horror mode, the next rocks solid cost no mana.

2840
01:58:51,410 --> 01:58:52,010
What the hak?

2841
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:52,870
I'm not going to use rocks.

2842
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:56,390
I feel like the cloud sweep is just better.

2843
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:57,310
I don't know.

2844
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:01,870
I feel like that's just a better weapon in general.

2845
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:07,150
A better skill in general.

2846
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:08,050
That's what I mean.

2847
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:10,270
Alright.

2848
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:15,340
What the fuck?

2849
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:16,900
Can I see you?

2850
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,740
Brock says it can parry?

2851
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,300
Yeah, but like, you know I'm not good at that.

2852
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,200
Hahaha.

2853
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:29,280
Pew!

2854
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:29,720
Pew!

2855
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:31,240
Pew!

2856
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:33,680
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted.

2857
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:34,520
Oh, I'm too far.

2858
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:34,920
Too far.

2859
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:36,180
I went too far.

2860
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,680
Wait, did he die?

2861
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:38,960
Oh no, he's over there.

2862
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:44,530
Alright.

2863
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:49,370
Guys, what is better then?

2864
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:50,610
Parry or...

2865
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:53,530
Sorry.

2866
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:54,890
Ghost or... Sorry.

2867
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:56,150
Cloud or...

2868
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:58,490
I'll get it right eventually!

2869
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:06,810
It only took me like three chances to figure out the right one.

2870
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:10,650
Which is a better skill?

2871
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:13,090
Cloud or rock?

2872
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,690
I need to rest up.

2873
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:17,930
I have to fight that guy again.

2874
02:00:18,030 --> 02:00:19,110
I realize I had no mana.

2875
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,730
Depends on the boss, really.

2876
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:27,710
I had to fight him again because I realized I forgot to get my mana.

2877
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:29,250
Oh shit!

2878
02:00:31,650 --> 02:00:32,730
Depends on my skill?

2879
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,650
I don't know.

2880
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:38,610
I can't tell which is like...

2881
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,950
Which one would be better for me.

2882
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:47,040
Alright.

2883
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:48,280
Come on.

2884
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:48,720
Come on.

2885
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:49,160
Get over here.

2886
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:49,760
Boom!

2887
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:50,800
Yeah, that's right.

2888
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,460
No more shield for you.

2889
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,060
No more shield for you, bitch!

2890
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:54,200
Oh shit!

2891
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:54,620
Okay.

2892
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:57,900
Even though he doesn't have a shield, he still hits pretty hard.

2893
02:00:58,360 --> 02:00:59,220
I only have stamina!

2894
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:00,940
I don't need it!

2895
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:03,820
Alright.

2896
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:04,240
Nice.

2897
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:07,820
For normal mods?

2898
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:10,780
Oh, I've been using clouds for not normal mods.

2899
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:13,380
You haven't tried... You know, I'll try stone.

2900
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:14,740
Just for you guys.

2901
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:16,880
What if I can poke him off?

2902
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:18,280
Nope.

2903
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,360
They have invisible walls.

2904
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:21,880
Okay.

2905
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,040
I'll try this stone.

2906
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:25,880
Let's see.

2907
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,700
Set spells.

2908
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,720
Should be this.

2909
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:31,200
Okay.

2910
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,280
Guys,

2911
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:45,260
they can shatter the rock.

2912
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,980
Guys.

2913
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,560
Can the bosses shatter it?

2914
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,260
Alright.

2915
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:53,280
Let's try it out.

2916
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:57,200
I'm just wondering if the bosses can shatter it though.

2917
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:58,840
That's what I'm worried about.

2918
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:02,780
Get him out of here.

2919
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:04,240
Get him out of here.

2920
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:07,620
Nice.

2921
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,920
I'm gonna rob you now.

2922
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,400
Wait, who's still here?

2923
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,260
God damn it!

2924
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,340
You're fucking... Stay dead!

2925
02:02:12,580 --> 02:02:13,080
Go to hell!

2926
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,260
Go to hell and accept your judgement!

2927
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:18,040
Alright.

2928
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:25,610
Let's see.

2929
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:25,890
Oh!

2930
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:27,490
Yay!

2931
02:02:28,410 --> 02:02:31,030
Like, I'm gathering all these ingredients but I'm not...

2932
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:37,890
I'm not using any of the items that these ingredients make.

2933
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:43,430
You don't understand, chat.

2934
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:48,510
I need it on the final boss.

2935
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:50,910
Guys, I'll use...

2936
02:02:50,910 --> 02:02:54,130
Guys, I gotta save for the final boss.

2937
02:02:55,070 --> 02:02:57,470
The final boss is gonna be so hard.

2938
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:59,810
It's gonna be so hard if I don't save it for that!

2939
02:03:00,330 --> 02:03:01,010
Chat!

2940
02:03:03,330 --> 02:03:04,130
Who's he?

2941
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,550
He looks like a particular individual.

2942
02:03:10,230 --> 02:03:10,690
Who's he?

2943
02:03:10,890 --> 02:03:12,390
What's my... Where's my son?

2944
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:13,390
I can't find him?

2945
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,830
Jesus Christ!

2946
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,030
What the fuck?

2947
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:20,010
Boom!

2948
02:03:20,350 --> 02:03:21,470
How did I miss?

2949
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:25,590
Holy shit!

2950
02:03:28,350 --> 02:03:28,790
Okay.

2951
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:31,450
Oh!

2952
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:32,770
Haha!

2953
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:35,590
Okay, apparently, like, I did more...

2954
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:38,510
I did enough damage where, like, he got...

2955
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:41,010
Oh, fuck!

2956
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:43,570
Oh, shit!

2957
02:03:43,650 --> 02:03:43,930
Okay!

2958
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,170
Okay, old man!

2959
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:46,630
Oh, my God!

2960
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:46,930
God!

2961
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,440
Yes!

2962
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:52,520
Did I do it?

2963
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,720
Did I time it perfectly?

2964
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:55,420
I can't tell!

2965
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,780
Oh, fuck!

2966
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,840
He took me out of the sky!

2967
02:03:58,220 --> 02:03:59,040
Oh, no!

2968
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:00,820
Oh, no!

2969
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:01,100
No!

2970
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:02,140
It's not fair!

2971
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,120
He has such long days!

2972
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:05,420
Oh!

2973
02:04:13,690 --> 02:04:14,590
I'm panicking too!

2974
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:19,150
With the sheer power of panic!

2975
02:04:20,170 --> 02:04:21,530
I did it!

2976
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:23,770
Oh, thank God!

2977
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:26,830
You'll never find your son!

2978
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:30,270
That's fucking right!

2979
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:36,990
That's fucking right!

2980
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:39,190
You wasted 80 years of your life!

2981
02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:39,970
Oh!

2982
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:40,430
Wait!

2983
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,830
New...

2984
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:41,450
New skill?

2985
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,050
New summon?

2986
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:45,030
Wait!

2987
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:46,250
Is he stronger than Baby?

2988
02:04:47,650 --> 02:04:48,670
There's no way!

2989
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,490
Is he stronger than Baby?

2990
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:56,850
Now I have an 80-year-old man to transform into!

2991
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:58,030
Hehehe!

2992
02:04:58,530 --> 02:04:58,610
Hehehe!

2993
02:04:58,810 --> 02:04:59,310
Hehehe!

2994
02:04:59,310 --> 02:04:59,690
Hehehe!

2995
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:00,250
Hehehe!

2996
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,270
How would we...

2997
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:06,750
Oh, fuck!

2998
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:07,790
You guys had a day!

2999
02:05:08,750 --> 02:05:10,230
How do we know?

3000
02:05:10,330 --> 02:05:11,950
You guys had a day!

3001
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:13,230
That's how you'll know!

3002
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:21,490
A day is plenty enough time!

3003
02:05:26,650 --> 02:05:28,010
I need to know!

3004
02:05:28,130 --> 02:05:30,230
Which is better, Baby or Christy?

3005
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:37,520
Oh shit.

3006
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,620
I know I should like... I liked how I used that.

3007
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,000
Okay, I used the fucking...

3008
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,460
the heavy combo on the fucking zombie.

3009
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:53,860
Like, yeah, that's priorities right there.

3010
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,880
All right, there has to be loot here.

3011
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:00,860
Why else is it...

3012
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:02,100
like this?

3013
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:06,100
The wikis haven't been written yet.

3014
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:11,880
God damn it.

3015
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:13,460
How would I know?

3016
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,460
How would I know which is stronger?

3017
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:20,180
Baby or grandpa?

3018
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:23,600
Oh, hey.

3019
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:25,080
Oh, I finally got new wine.

3020
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:26,740
God, fucking finally.

3021
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:30,160
New wine time.

3022
02:06:30,580 --> 02:06:32,120
Wait, what is this new wine?

3023
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:36,020
Inventory.

3024
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,300
Oh, never mind.

3025
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,540
Wait, what did I get?

3026
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:41,040
That's not wine.

3027
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,320
Is that normal... what is that?

3028
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:44,560
Man bat.

3029
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,220
Get out of here, man bat.

3030
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:51,880
Okay, I actually want to get the archer out.

3031
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:56,400
Oh shit.

3032
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,180
Man bat, I'm here to collect rent.

3033
02:06:58,500 --> 02:06:59,980
You're two months behind rent.

3034
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,980
Rent, man bat.

3035
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:03,680
Haha.

3036
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,280
That's right.

3037
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:04,800
Man bat, you're two months behind rent.

3038
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:04,800
Rent, man bat.

3039
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:06,720
I'm the shark.

3040
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,500
I'm here to collect your hard rent.

3041
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:13,100
Alright.

3042
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:14,460
There you go.

3043
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,900
Go this way.

3044
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:18,960
I'm the lone shark.

3045
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:23,480
This way?

3046
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,740
Okay, no.

3047
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:25,720
That's the wall.

3048
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,500
I'm sorry, I thought there would be loot!

3049
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,060
I'm always thinking, loot?

3050
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:30,280
Loot?

3051
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:34,060
Like those little seagulls.

3052
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,360
From Finding Nemo.

3053
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:38,140
Oh, loot.

3054
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:40,100
The lone monkey is here.

3055
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:40,800
It's a cave.

3056
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,560
Yeah, but like real estate is hard right now.

3057
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:46,300
Even caves cost 5 million.

3058
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,640
It's the experience.

3059
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:49,780
Alright?

3060
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:51,820
It's the experience cave.

3061
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,160
Oh, the stone vanguard.

3062
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:59,000
Wait, what happens if rock...

3063
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:04,480
Wait, I don't have Wait, oh my god.

3064
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:06,400
That's a strong-ass fucking rock.

3065
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:08,980
Okay, nice.

3066
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,620
Fire versus rock!

3067
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:12,700
Clearly that would do a lot of damage!

3068
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:15,160
Guys, I don't understand.

3069
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:17,440
Why is fire not doing a lot of damage?

3070
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:19,220
Oh, I forgot I'm also rock.

3071
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:25,460
I already forgot how to aim my power up.

3072
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:28,920
Jesus Christ.

3073
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:32,840
Oh.

3074
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:35,800
I don't know his moves!

3075
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:38,540
He's just a giant rock!

3076
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,480
Like, it's so hard to predict too!

3077
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,500
Oh my god.

3078
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:46,920
Please.

3079
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,420
Oh my god.

3080
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:57,880
Wait, this is actually so hard to predict because he's literally just a fucking rock.

3081
02:08:59,300 --> 02:08:59,880
Okay.

3082
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,480
Okay.

3083
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:04,200
Is he lost?

3084
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:06,460
Oh shit!

3085
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:07,420
No, he was not lost.

3086
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:10,540
He was not lost.

3087
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:11,600
Guys!

3088
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:13,160
Ah!

3089
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:16,580
Guys, it's over.

3090
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,000
Wait, he does have some cheeks!

3091
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:21,680
Holy shit!

3092
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:23,240
Wait, who fucking designed you?

3093
02:09:23,580 --> 02:09:24,360
Big baby!

3094
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:28,500
Boom!

3095
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:33,040
Oh, rock angry.

3096
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:35,480
Rock very angry.

3097
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:37,560
Wait, wait, mini rock?

3098
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:38,860
Rock was pregnant?

3099
02:09:40,260 --> 02:09:41,740
For god's sake!

3100
02:09:46,290 --> 02:09:47,870
Oh my god.

3101
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:50,080
Oh my god.

3102
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:51,520
Congratulations.

3103
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,360
It was six tuplets.

3104
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:58,200
It was six tuplets.

3105
02:09:58,580 --> 02:10:00,780
It was six tuplets.

3106
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:05,660
Oh my god.

3107
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:07,200
Oh my god.

3108
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:09,160
Oh my god.

3109
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:11,040
Oh, I have to do this thing.

3110
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:11,560
Oh, I have to do this thing.

3111
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:12,440
I think I...

3112
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,420
I'm just gonna run.

3113
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:19,820
I'm trying to figure out if I want to use baby or grandpa.

3114
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:28,100
Okay, wait.

3115
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:29,080
Where's the transformation?

3116
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:31,000
Six?

3117
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:31,460
No.

3118
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:32,400
Advance.

3119
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:33,220
There you go.

3120
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,220
Wait, no.

3121
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,900
Oh wait, but I do have...

3122
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,420
I want to upgrade my thrust.

3123
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:41,760
Okay.

3124
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,100
Finally.

3125
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:45,280
Alright, two to three.

3126
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:45,800
Oh, nice!

3127
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:46,800
Okay, we need that.

3128
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:49,020
Um...

3129
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:56,670
Let's see...

3130
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:58,310
I wanna get...

3131
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:00,370
I'll get health.

3132
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:02,730
Alright.

3133
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,260
There's a closer shrine?

3134
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:10,300
I missed the shrine?

3135
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:12,920
God!

3136
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:16,220
Where's the...

3137
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:17,700
Wait, I have another one?

3138
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:19,580
Oh, the...

3139
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:21,580
Oh, the rock one.

3140
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:24,060
Where's the...

3141
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:26,200
transformation again?

3142
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,080
Oh, here it is.

3143
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,580
Equipment.

3144
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:28,620
Alright.

3145
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,940
Oh, it's still not as good.

3146
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:38,960
I feel like big baby is still the strongest.

3147
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,360
Let's see...

3148
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:46,080
Oh, cultivate.

3149
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:47,780
Do I have upgrades for big baby?

3150
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:48,680
Baby!

3151
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:49,800
No.

3152
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:50,800
God damn it.

3153
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:52,600
Change your gourd?

3154
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:53,620
Oh, do I have new gourd?

3155
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:57,340
Wait, I can change my gourd?

3156
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:01,700
Where's gourd?

3157
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:24,200
I can change my gourd.

3158
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:32,900
I can change my gourd.

3159
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:34,560
I can change my gourd.

3160
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,840
I've had it since beta.

3161
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:51,600
Wait!

3162
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:56,900
Life is cruel.

3163
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:00,820
Life is so cruel.

3164
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:06,080
Since the start of the game.

3165
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:10,260
Alright, time to fucking kill the rock.

3166
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:13,640
Why is life so cruel?

3167
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:16,500
Versus the staff.

3168
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:19,420
Now it's the coin.

3169
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:28,060
Oh my god, it's time to collect my rent and collect my rent again.

3170
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:33,120
Why do I make this game harder for myself?

3171
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:39,460
I've basically been gaming this entire time.

3172
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:43,560
I could have finished this game already.

3173
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:50,920
I bet you if I knew about all of this, this game would have been done yesterday.

3174
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:56,060
I would have one-shot this game.

3175
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:59,080
Where the fuck is the...

3176
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:03,560
I tried black scenes twice.

3177
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:06,260
I didn't see the red dot on the Gordon and figured you noticed it.

3178
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:09,100
But it was most naturally comedic.

3179
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:11,580
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

3180
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:12,040
Thank you.

3181
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:12,720
Thank you.

3182
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,020
It was just funny.

3183
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,960
Oh wait, there it is.

3184
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,160
Wait, I can... I don't have to wake up the rock?

3185
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,780
The rock was op... No!

3186
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:29,780
How did you wake up?

3187
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:34,820
Oh my god!

3188
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:40,100
The rock was optional.

3189
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:43,620
The rock was optional!

3190
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:49,260
Alright.

3191
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:52,440
Oh my god.

3192
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:54,640
Oh, I fucked up.

3193
02:14:54,900 --> 02:14:56,260
I fucked up.

3194
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:58,020
I had to...

3195
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,740
Oh, it's not optional?

3196
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:03,500
It's not optional?

3197
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:07,140
I can't even sneak past the rock?

3198
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:09,800
Gotta fucking slap his ass.

3199
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:14,570
Boom!

3200
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:15,810
Slap that!

3201
02:15:16,030 --> 02:15:17,050
Slap that!

3202
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:17,930
Slap that!

3203
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:19,050
Oh shit!

3204
02:15:19,130 --> 02:15:19,690
I'm sorry.

3205
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:20,330
I'm sorry.

3206
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:21,470
I'm so sorry.

3207
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:22,050
I'll be more polite.

3208
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:25,350
You're more than your ass.

3209
02:15:25,550 --> 02:15:26,250
I'm so sorry.

3210
02:15:26,330 --> 02:15:26,670
You're right.

3211
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:28,810
You're so much more than your ass.

3212
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:30,250
You're so much more.

3213
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:35,210
You're right.

3214
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,050
I'm sorry for assuming that.

3215
02:15:41,690 --> 02:15:42,170
Alright.

3216
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:43,390
Freeze the rock.

3217
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:47,780
My god.

3218
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,340
Oh, it's the children!

3219
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:52,220
It's the children!

3220
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:57,730
Oh, I fucked up the timing.

3221
02:15:59,290 --> 02:15:59,850
Doki.

3222
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:02,730
He has a wonderful personality, Doki.

3223
02:16:03,790 --> 02:16:05,430
He's not just his ass.

3224
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,530
I'm sorry!

3225
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:09,410
Alright.

3226
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:10,750
Nice.

3227
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:14,750
Nice.

3228
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:15,090
Okay.

3229
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:18,690
I felt like that was not really a very good parry anyway.

3230
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:23,240
Oh, shit!

3231
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:27,420
Jesus Christ.

3232
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:29,060
This is so difficult!

3233
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,640
Guys, I don't...

3234
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:32,580
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

3235
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:35,540
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

3236
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,800
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

3237
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:40,580
I'm literally 1HP.

3238
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,680
Oh my god!

3239
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,460
Oh my god!

3240
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:44,900
Okay!

3241
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:45,860
Woah!

3242
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:46,480
Okay.

3243
02:16:52,250 --> 02:16:52,810
Alright.

3244
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:53,130
Awesome.

3245
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:58,760
Okay.

3246
02:16:58,760 --> 02:16:59,920
I got a regen.

3247
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,500
I got a regen!

3248
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:04,680
You guys, I'm so far off.

3249
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,300
Oh my god.

3250
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:12,820
It's not looking so good for Doki!

3251
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,260
He slapped me!

3252
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:23,640
Oh fuck, okay.

3253
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:36,300
Why is he so tanky?

3254
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:38,020
Oh, because he's a rock.

3255
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:39,920
I get it.

3256
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:46,260
No, no, that makes sense.

3257
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:47,040
No, he's right.

3258
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:47,620
You're right.

3259
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:51,000
He's a rock.

3260
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:57,340
I'm gonna... I'm gonna use the cloud.

3261
02:17:57,620 --> 02:17:59,540
I can't time this.

3262
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:01,080
Insane revelation.

3263
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:04,180
Alright.

3264
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:05,100
Let's see.

3265
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,100
We're gonna use the cloud.

3266
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:08,540
I can't time this correctly.

3267
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:11,300
Alright, goodbye.

3268
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:19,680
Guys, we need paper.

3269
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:22,700
We need...

3270
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:25,100
Guys.

3271
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:27,260
We...

3272
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:29,580
Where can I upgrade paper to paper?

3273
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:34,420
I have to go to the other side?

3274
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:35,400
Alright.

3275
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:36,960
Yeah, I rather... I wanted...

3276
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:37,940
Thank you.

3277
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:40,860
See, this is why I waited another day before I play it again.

3278
02:18:41,060 --> 02:18:42,760
I knew at one point...

3279
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:45,640
I told you guys.

3280
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:49,800
One day is all it takes for backseaters to figure this out.

3281
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:54,340
This is exactly why.

3282
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:59,080
Alright, goodbye.

3283
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,540
See, we gotta go this way.

3284
02:19:06,980 --> 02:19:09,040
Imagine if I was there during launch.

3285
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,280
I would have never known.

3286
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:11,460
Oh, shit.

3287
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:12,180
Whoops.

3288
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:15,280
Alright.

3289
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:17,620
We go to the right.

3290
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,600
To the right, to the right.

3291
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:28,850
To the right, to the right.

3292
02:19:28,850 --> 02:19:29,050
Alright.

3293
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:33,250
There shouldn't be another guard here, right?

3294
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:38,230
Is there another incense area here?

3295
02:19:40,650 --> 02:19:41,390
Oh, there it is.

3296
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:41,970
Nice.

3297
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:47,660
Huh?

3298
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:50,480
Alright,

3299
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:56,000
here we go.

3300
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,040
We can finally rest.

3301
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:03,040
Alright.

3302
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:06,860
Why were you chanting, Mr. Rock?

3303
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:15,420
I'm gonna take your eyes.

3304
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,560
And worry for... Oh, hello there.

3305
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:18,480
Hello.

3306
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:20,600
Hey.

3307
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:22,280
Oh, shit.

3308
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:24,740
Sorry, was that... Oh, shit.

3309
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:25,100
Sorry.

3310
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,020
Shit, was that... Oh, okay.

3311
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:29,100
Alright, sir.

3312
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:39,310
Alright, sorry for taking your eyes.

3313
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:44,450
I did not... That was... It was just a... It was just a silly joke, sir.

3314
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:45,170
I'm sorry.

3315
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:48,090
I didn't mean to take your eyes.

3316
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:51,450
I did not mean to take your eyes.

3317
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:54,810
Okay.

3318
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:57,730
Alright, well, it's too bad.

3319
02:20:57,890 --> 02:20:58,850
Eyes are gone.

3320
02:20:59,130 --> 02:21:00,690
Alright, we're gonna go fight the rock.

3321
02:21:01,030 --> 02:21:02,530
He's not gonna follow me, right?

3322
02:21:02,650 --> 02:21:03,310
To the rock?

3323
02:21:03,570 --> 02:21:04,350
There's no way.

3324
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:06,270
That would be so silly.

3325
02:21:09,690 --> 02:21:13,810
That would be so silly if he followed me all the way to the rock.

3326
02:21:14,350 --> 02:21:15,650
Surely not, yeah?

3327
02:21:16,290 --> 02:21:17,230
There's no way.

3328
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:23,210
Fire versus rock!

3329
02:21:23,310 --> 02:21:23,950
Who will win?

3330
02:21:26,050 --> 02:21:27,330
I don't know, guys.

3331
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:30,950
I think... I think fire can burn rock if it's enough fire.

3332
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:36,150
All I'm saying is that...

3333
02:21:36,150 --> 02:21:39,350
If there was enough fire going on, maybe... maybe?

3334
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:45,630
You don't know that!

3335
02:21:46,750 --> 02:21:47,310
Guys!

3336
02:21:49,330 --> 02:21:49,890
Boom!

3337
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:50,670
Smack that!

3338
02:21:51,150 --> 02:21:52,730
Smack that!

3339
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:54,550
Oh, shit!

3340
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:54,930
Sorry!

3341
02:21:55,010 --> 02:21:55,550
Smack me!

3342
02:21:58,270 --> 02:22:00,610
Might as well smack me too, I guess.

3343
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:04,930
Jesus!

3344
02:22:05,050 --> 02:22:06,170
I need to time that better.

3345
02:22:07,530 --> 02:22:08,050
Okay.

3346
02:22:10,410 --> 02:22:11,210
You remember.

3347
02:22:14,050 --> 02:22:14,570
Boom!

3348
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:17,250
Boom!

3349
02:22:17,570 --> 02:22:18,510
That's fucking right.

3350
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:20,130
Oh, nice.

3351
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:21,430
Oh, not nice!

3352
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:23,030
It's the children!

3353
02:22:26,470 --> 02:22:28,290
They're here for the money payments!

3354
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:32,550
How do I even know they're mine?

3355
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:36,150
I know I was born from rocks, but how would I know?

3356
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:40,610
Are you fucking...

3357
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:42,070
I can't.

3358
02:22:42,130 --> 02:22:42,330
I...

3359
02:22:42,330 --> 02:22:43,810
I can't.

3360
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,350
Fuck you.

3361
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:50,970
All right.

3362
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:53,110
The child support.

3363
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:54,010
Oh, no!

3364
02:22:54,250 --> 02:22:55,970
He's here for the child support.

3365
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:58,050
How do I even know they're mine, though?

3366
02:23:01,170 --> 02:23:03,830
There could be anybody's rock, children!

3367
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:05,230
Oh, no!

3368
02:23:05,530 --> 02:23:06,130
Oh, no!

3369
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:10,150
The child support.

3370
02:23:10,150 --> 02:23:10,230
Oh, we're gonna have the child support.

3371
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:10,770
Oh my God.

3372
02:23:14,330 --> 02:23:16,750
I like how every time, like...

3373
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:24,350
Every time, like, I don't fight a monster, I just forget how to fight them.

3374
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:27,510
Oh, please!

3375
02:23:28,150 --> 02:23:29,610
This is where I die.

3376
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:34,870
They have your...

3377
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:36,110
They have the...

3378
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:40,330
They could be anybody's Rockids!

3379
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:44,450
I'm not the only Rock- I am the only Rockmonkey out there.

3380
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:52,380
But like, but like, it could be anybody's.

3381
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:55,340
It could be, it could be anybody.

3382
02:23:58,580 --> 02:24:00,720
It could just be me.

3383
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:03,120
How would I know?

3384
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:06,640
There's so many other Rocks, Rocks here.

3385
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:08,740
Wait, what's this?

3386
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:11,720
Knock, knock.

3387
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:17,480
What?

3388
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:22,140
What the fuck am I supposed to do interacting with this?

3389
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:27,020
It's bound by six seals.

3390
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:31,260
Get up!

3391
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:34,520
Get up!

3392
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:40,590
This is the first time I've met this Rock!

3393
02:24:40,850 --> 02:24:41,370
It could be me!

3394
02:24:41,390 --> 02:24:42,070
It could be anybody!

3395
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:49,880
All I'm saying is like...

3396
02:24:52,510 --> 02:24:55,760
This is the very first time I've even seen this Rock.

3397
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:59,940
Like, it could be anybody's Rock.

3398
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:01,360
Alright.

3399
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:02,420
Boom!

3400
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:03,100
Big baby!

3401
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:06,260
Smack that!

3402
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:08,180
Smack that!

3403
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:10,840
Oh shit!

3404
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:13,100
I need to stop smacking that.

3405
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:14,620
I can't help it.

3406
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:16,760
Oh...

3407
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:19,360
I can't help it.

3408
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:20,000
I mean...

3409
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:20,660
Damn!

3410
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:23,780
Oh shit!

3411
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:24,480
Damn me!

3412
02:25:25,660 --> 02:25:29,560
Okay, I need to like figure out like the proper movesets for this guy.

3413
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:32,500
Woo!

3414
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:32,820
Woo!

3415
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:33,660
Woo!

3416
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:35,720
Oh no, it's the children already?!

3417
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:38,240
The child support already gave it you last year!

3418
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:41,760
I don't understand!

3419
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:42,940
I paid last year!

3420
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:44,300
You didn't pay more?!

3421
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:47,480
You can't just pay yearly?!

3422
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:49,290
Is that how child support works?!

3423
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:58,800
What the fuck do you mean?!

3424
02:26:01,220 --> 02:26:03,020
I'm not a bad person.

3425
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:04,980
Alright.

3426
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:08,600
Let's see.

3427
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:11,020
Nice, there we go.

3428
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:14,280
Alright, there we go.

3429
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:16,440
It's fine.

3430
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:18,980
He's gonna get closer to me, right?

3431
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:22,060
Okay.

3432
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:29,560
That's fucked.

3433
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:31,960
He literally threw a Rock at me.

3434
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:35,260
Holy shit.

3435
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,740
Why is he so mad?!

3436
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,580
What did I do?!

3437
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:42,980
What could I have possibly done?!

3438
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:47,740
Smack!

3439
02:26:49,060 --> 02:26:50,240
Okay.

3440
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:51,520
Alright.

3441
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,000
Smack!

3442
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:55,200
Alright.

3443
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:56,180
Nice.

3444
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,000
Smack again!

3445
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,520
Okay.

3446
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:02,480
Alright.

3447
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:03,860
Nice.

3448
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:08,830
Okay.

3449
02:27:08,830 --> 02:27:15,890
Oh, I forgot that was the pa- Oh no, not the children, not the child support.

3450
02:27:16,050 --> 02:27:17,210
Please, I already paid last year's.

3451
02:27:17,310 --> 02:27:17,750
Please.

3452
02:27:18,330 --> 02:27:19,550
Paid last year's.

3453
02:27:19,550 --> 02:27:21,690
Is that not enough, children?!

3454
02:27:21,690 --> 02:27:23,410
I'm just a monkey!

3455
02:27:24,330 --> 02:27:26,290
It doesn't pay a lot to be a monkey!

3456
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:31,490
I don't have hands!

3457
02:27:31,730 --> 02:27:32,090
Oh!

3458
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:33,230
Shit!

3459
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:38,470
I don't know why you think I make a lot of money!

3460
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:45,430
I literally was- I'm literally just a fucking rock monkey!

3461
02:27:49,390 --> 02:27:50,470
Oh god.

3462
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:52,670
Oh my god.

3463
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:58,450
Oh god.

3464
02:27:58,590 --> 02:27:59,890
I'm so scared.

3465
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:03,450
He wants more child support!

3466
02:28:05,630 --> 02:28:06,790
One fear.

3467
02:28:06,910 --> 02:28:07,790
Child support.

3468
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:08,310
No!

3469
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:08,810
No!

3470
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:09,770
No!

3471
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:10,870
No!

3472
02:28:14,650 --> 02:28:15,830
One fear!

3473
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:20,890
Oh god.

3474
02:28:21,070 --> 02:28:21,950
Oh god!

3475
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:26,070
Guys, I don't- I don't know, guys.

3476
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,440
Oh!

3477
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:34,260
Come

3478
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:38,360
on!

3479
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:41,780
I don't do enough damage!

3480
02:28:58,260 --> 02:28:58,440
Argh!

3481
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,220
He is actually!

3482
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:02,100
Oh my God!

3483
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:05,160
I cannot!

3484
02:29:05,160 --> 02:29:06,320
I cannot do it!

3485
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:07,520
I'm 3D!

3486
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:12,740
Oh, I got it!

3487
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:14,440
I got 2!

3488
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:19,100
I was like, I'll hit it before he hits me!

3489
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:22,320
Oh, my God!

3490
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:28,120
Oh, my God!

3491
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:30,660
That's really not fair!

3492
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:35,840
This is not fair!

3493
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:39,840
Oh, my God!

3494
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:41,300
Boom!

3495
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:44,120
Boom!

3496
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:44,880
Boom!

3497
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:45,860
Boom!

3498
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:46,520
Boom!

3499
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:48,840
How does he think?

3500
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:52,700
Like, have we ever thought that I'm the victim?

3501
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:00,440
Maybe I'm the victim here!

3502
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:06,340
Yeah!

3503
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:13,040
Oh, God!

3504
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:14,760
No!

3505
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:15,460
I was stranded!

3506
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,360
Wait, what?

3507
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:17,380
I got stunned!

3508
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:18,800
It didn't even hurt me!

3509
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:19,800
Wait, what?

3510
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:22,960
Okay, now it hurts me.

3511
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:23,240
Okay.

3512
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:27,080
Fuck!

3513
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:29,120
I keep forgetting that!

3514
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:33,120
Oh!

3515
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:35,800
She's the victim.

3516
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:37,700
Refuses to pay child support.

3517
02:30:38,820 --> 02:30:39,740
Oh, God!

3518
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:43,720
Piff!

3519
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:44,260
Nice!

3520
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:46,760
Slap that ass!

3521
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,920
That's fucking right!

3522
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:49,340
Slap that ass!

3523
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:50,000
Boom!

3524
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:52,980
Boom!

3525
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,720
Last final slap!

3526
02:30:55,900 --> 02:30:56,940
God, I missed that ass!

3527
02:30:57,520 --> 02:30:58,200
Okay.

3528
02:31:01,020 --> 02:31:01,940
Come on!

3529
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:03,100
Slap!

3530
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:05,840
Oh!

3531
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:08,780
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine!

3532
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:09,580
Everything is fine!

3533
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:11,040
Nice!

3534
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:13,480
Oh, I forgot about the second move!

3535
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:16,800
Slap!

3536
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:22,320
Oh, okay, we're good!

3537
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:23,140
We're okay!

3538
02:31:23,380 --> 02:31:24,300
We're so healthy!

3539
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:26,260
We're so healthy!

3540
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:28,260
We're so healthy!

3541
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:30,260
Nice!

3542
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:30,900
Nice!

3543
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,500
Oh, we're not healthy anymore!

3544
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:37,160
But unless...

3545
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:40,700
Oh, my God!

3546
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:44,340
I keep forgetting to use the... the other move!

3547
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:45,480
Oh!

3548
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:50,740
Oh, no!

3549
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:52,720
He slapped the cord out of my hand!

3550
02:31:52,900 --> 02:31:53,740
That should be illegal!

3551
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:57,680
Oh, my God!

3552
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:58,600
She's throwing rocks!

3553
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:59,300
She's so mad!

3554
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,140
Why are you so angry?

3555
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:02,720
Oh!

3556
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,520
Not the children!

3557
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,740
Stop sending kids into our arguments!

3558
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:09,720
This is between you and me!

3559
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:20,520
It's like she's angry.

3560
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:29,020
This fight is between you and me!

3561
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:32,460
Don't get their kids involved!

3562
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:32,700
Oh!

3563
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:33,160
Oh, no!

3564
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:38,780
Narangi!

3565
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:42,980
It's your turn to spend time with the children!

3566
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:50,480
The kids have nothing to do with this!

3567
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:57,400
You can't escape the child's support!

3568
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:02,880
It's your turn to deal with the children!

3569
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:04,880
But, like...

3570
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:07,620
You don't understand!

3571
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:11,060
I have got a game with the boys today!

3572
02:33:11,320 --> 02:33:12,780
I can't look after them!

3573
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:14,580
It's boys' night!

3574
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:18,400
What they do every night is boys' night.

3575
02:33:21,540 --> 02:33:23,660
The rock missus doesn't know that, though.

3576
02:33:24,280 --> 02:33:25,100
Ah, fuck!

3577
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:25,380
Okay.

3578
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:29,280
He has to get closer to me, right?

3579
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:31,660
Okay.

3580
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:34,480
All right.

3581
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:34,780
Nice.

3582
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:35,780
Okay.

3583
02:33:35,860 --> 02:33:36,500
We dodged that.

3584
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:40,600
All right.

3585
02:33:40,960 --> 02:33:41,540
Come on.

3586
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:41,780
Come on.

3587
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:42,060
Come on.

3588
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:42,980
Fucking hell!

3589
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:44,360
Nice!

3590
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,300
Dodge!

3591
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:46,080
Oh, no!

3592
02:33:46,140 --> 02:33:46,600
Not the children!

3593
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:47,400
Not the children!

3594
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:48,320
Not the children!

3595
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:49,220
Not the children!

3596
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:50,080
Not the children!

3597
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:52,360
Not the children!

3598
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:52,880
Oh, God!

3599
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:53,780
It's the kids again!

3600
02:33:53,900 --> 02:33:54,480
It's the kids!

3601
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:55,220
It's the kids!

3602
02:34:00,790 --> 02:34:01,150
Oh!

3603
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:09,130
Smack!

3604
02:34:10,030 --> 02:34:10,530
Come on.

3605
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:10,910
Come on.

3606
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:11,150
Come on.

3607
02:34:11,150 --> 02:34:11,330
Come on.

3608
02:34:11,350 --> 02:34:11,470
Come on.

3609
02:34:11,490 --> 02:34:11,570
Come on.

3610
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:12,290
Come on.

3611
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:13,290
Boom!

3612
02:34:14,190 --> 02:34:14,830
All right.

3613
02:34:16,370 --> 02:34:16,930
Oh!

3614
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:19,330
Oh...

3615
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:21,630
Dodge!

3616
02:34:21,890 --> 02:34:22,430
Dodge!

3617
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:26,190
All right.

3618
02:34:27,210 --> 02:34:28,770
I have full focused now.

3619
02:34:29,730 --> 02:34:31,150
I need a full focus.

3620
02:34:32,590 --> 02:34:33,150
Smack!

3621
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:37,290
At least I really don't want this.

3622
02:34:37,290 --> 02:34:39,110
This is harder than Tony the tiger.

3623
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:39,850
No!

3624
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:40,890
Hurry up.

3625
02:34:40,890 --> 02:34:44,230
Oh, is he harder than Tony the Tiger?

3626
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:50,610
Oh, please.

3627
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:54,910
No!

3628
02:34:55,170 --> 02:34:56,430
Oh shit, that was close.

3629
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:02,850
Oh, is he so much more difficult than Tony?

3630
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:07,070
He's just a rock!

3631
02:35:07,070 --> 02:35:07,570
Oh!

3632
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:11,340
Okay.

3633
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:16,440
Oh my god, I got smacked again!

3634
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:19,640
Okay.

3635
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:25,830
Okay.

3636
02:35:28,490 --> 02:35:29,970
Come on, come on, please.

3637
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:30,470
No!

3638
02:35:30,590 --> 02:35:30,870
No!

3639
02:35:30,990 --> 02:35:32,350
Oh, I dodged it just in time!

3640
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:34,730
Oh god.

3641
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:36,150
No, not the children.

3642
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:37,710
Not the kids again.

3643
02:35:39,090 --> 02:35:39,890
Oh, please.

3644
02:35:43,190 --> 02:35:44,570
Oh, thank god.

3645
02:35:46,770 --> 02:35:47,570
Thank god!

3646
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:53,140
That's bullshit.

3647
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:55,180
That's actually bullshit!

3648
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:57,740
That should have been a hit!

3649
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:00,820
Alright.

3650
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:02,180
That should have been a dodge!

3651
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,140
That's bullshit too.

3652
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:12,660
Alright.

3653
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:13,600
Wolf time!

3654
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:15,000
Wolf time!

3655
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:18,260
Wolf time!

3656
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:23,300
Oh shit!

3657
02:36:23,740 --> 02:36:25,620
With the power of Wolf.

3658
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:27,620
Oh my god.

3659
02:36:31,660 --> 02:36:32,600
Don't get greedy.

3660
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:34,160
Don't get greedy.

3661
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:35,040
Don't get greedy.

3662
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:38,260
Don't get greedy, Toki.

3663
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,060
Don't get greedy.

3664
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:42,900
That's what they... That's what she was!

3665
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:46,440
Shit.

3666
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:46,960
Okay.

3667
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:47,180
Okay.

3668
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:48,520
My last heal.

3669
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:50,200
That's what she wants.

3670
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:53,360
Come on.

3671
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:54,280
Nice.

3672
02:36:56,940 --> 02:36:57,820
Yes!

3673
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:00,180
No more child support!

3674
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:06,540
Thank god!

3675
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:09,660
No more child support!

3676
02:37:10,700 --> 02:37:11,740
Let's go!

3677
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:13,700
Oh!

3678
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,980
And she disappeared.

3679
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:18,800
No one knows where she went.

3680
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:22,140
No one knows where she went!

3681
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:24,180
She just disappeared, guys!

3682
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:25,900
She just vanished!

3683
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:28,800
Holy fuck.

3684
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:32,080
That was so much work.

3685
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:35,560
She just vanished.

3686
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:39,000
We'll never know what happened to her.

3687
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:42,320
I was going to pay for the child support!

3688
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,320
But like...

3689
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:47,280
But like, she just disappeared.

3690
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:50,040
How else was I going to pay if I don't know where she was?

3691
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:54,880
That's so unfortunate.

3692
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:57,040
Oh well.

3693
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,400
Yeah, she just vanished.

3694
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:02,500
Don't look in the swamp.

3695
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:06,660
She just disappeared.

3696
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:08,500
Just like that.

3697
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,700
Right before the court case, too.

3698
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:16,860
But...

3699
02:38:20,530 --> 02:38:24,000
No more child support declares the murder.

3700
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:35,200
You know, I heard those kids weren't even mine.

3701
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:42,060
Maybe that's why I turned into a monkey.

3702
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:45,800
Maybe that's why I turned into a monkey.

3703
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:47,820
Hey, how do I get over there?

3704
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:49,620
Is that it?

3705
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:50,560
Was there nothing here?

3706
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:51,820
Oh, it was just a plant.

3707
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:53,020
So was me.

3708
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:56,460
Oh yeah, it was...

3709
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:01,620
I should like the thrusting more, but I...

3710
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:04,180
Alright, it's fine.

3711
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:05,480
Am I going to get poisoned?

3712
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:06,240
No.

3713
02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:08,040
It's just a regular plant.

3714
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:10,100
That's right, give me that ginseng.

3715
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:13,000
Oh no.

3716
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:17,300
Oh no, that was not just...

3717
02:39:17,300 --> 02:39:19,800
That was poison.

3718
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:33,930
I deserve that.

3719
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:35,570
Wait, which way do I go?

3720
02:39:35,710 --> 02:39:36,630
Left or right?

3721
02:39:36,930 --> 02:39:38,070
I don't even know.

3722
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:46,540
Okay, so I walked into that.

3723
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:49,840
I definitely walked into that.

3724
02:39:50,980 --> 02:39:53,180
It's like there's the Buddha eyes on the other side.

3725
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:54,200
I'll just walk this way.

3726
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:56,840
My old man, I learned my lesson this time.

3727
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,600
What?

3728
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:14,340
Okay.

3729
02:40:16,880 --> 02:40:18,800
What a weird dream I had.

3730
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:22,700
I wonder what's over here.

3731
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:24,720
Guys, you wouldn't believe it.

3732
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:26,700
I had the weirdest, freaky dream today.

3733
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:29,540
How?

3734
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:31,960
How do I dodge it?

3735
02:40:39,480 --> 02:40:41,720
Oh, wait, I got an idea.

3736
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:42,980
I got an idea.

3737
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:46,360
I got an idea.

3738
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,140
What's blocking?

3739
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:50,400
Anyway.

3740
02:40:50,860 --> 02:40:52,380
No, I got a better idea.

3741
02:40:54,700 --> 02:40:57,200
Sorry, I don't understand that concept.

3742
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:59,280
That's fucking right.

3743
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,260
That's fucking right.

3744
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:07,800
Oh my god.

3745
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:09,500
I'm going to use everything I know.

3746
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:11,880
I'm going to use everything I know against you.

3747
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:16,620
I'm going to use everything.

3748
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:19,520
Can't do anything now.

3749
02:41:19,940 --> 02:41:21,100
That's fucking right.

3750
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:22,900
They'll trap you in the corner.

3751
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,400
That's right.

3752
02:41:25,900 --> 02:41:27,000
That's fucking right.

3753
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:28,380
What you going to do now?

3754
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:33,060
Oh, thank fucking god.

3755
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:33,780
I'm sorry.

3756
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:36,820
I used everything I had.

3757
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:42,580
Oh my god.

3758
02:41:42,620 --> 02:41:45,800
The rat governor is still not as strong as baby.

3759
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:49,040
Oh, it's time to mat meditate.

3760
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:54,620
They'll never find the body.

3761
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:03,060
That's it.

3762
02:42:18,250 --> 02:42:19,910
No more child support.

3763
02:42:22,690 --> 02:42:25,870
What an interesting reflection.

3764
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:30,150
What are you guys talking about?

3765
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:31,970
I'm just meditating.

3766
02:42:34,890 --> 02:42:37,090
The rest is silence.

3767
02:42:40,810 --> 02:42:42,390
Alright, let's see.

3768
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:43,950
Oh, hey loot.

3769
02:42:44,130 --> 02:42:44,910
I love loot.

3770
02:42:46,990 --> 02:42:49,170
I've attained inner peace.

3771
02:42:50,890 --> 02:42:51,730
Oh, hey.

3772
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:52,890
Oh, mana.

3773
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:54,490
Nice.

3774
02:42:55,130 --> 02:42:57,330
I'd like me some mana.

3775
02:42:58,710 --> 02:42:59,710
What could it mean?

3776
02:42:59,710 --> 02:43:02,230
The scholars have been discussing this for generations.

3777
02:43:05,370 --> 02:43:07,730
Shroom Hong wrote on the tablet.

3778
02:43:07,930 --> 02:43:09,650
They'll never discover the body.

3779
02:43:09,930 --> 02:43:12,550
What could he possibly mean by that?

3780
02:43:15,770 --> 02:43:16,330
Wait.

3781
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:21,850
After all, unless the best one leaves four to engage them, he'd be saying to a barrage.

3782
02:43:22,570 --> 02:43:26,570
Hold light tack to... or after performing tactical...

3783
02:43:26,570 --> 02:43:28,870
I actually want to get the more foundation stuff.

3784
02:43:31,450 --> 02:43:31,930
Oh!

3785
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:34,490
Wait, that's good.

3786
02:43:36,330 --> 02:43:37,430
What could he mean?

3787
02:43:42,810 --> 02:43:47,810
And then next to the tablet were bunches of pebbles next to it.

3788
02:43:48,390 --> 02:43:50,250
I don't know if it correlates or anything.

3789
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:51,650
Oh, sand.

3790
02:43:53,890 --> 02:43:54,370
Yay!

3791
02:43:57,270 --> 02:43:58,150
Yay!

3792
02:43:58,870 --> 02:43:59,530
Ow!

3793
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:00,290
Ow!

3794
02:44:01,310 --> 02:44:02,190
Yay!

3795
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:04,950
How the fuck do I dodge this?

3796
02:44:05,490 --> 02:44:07,290
Just on the slide!

3797
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:09,990
Yippee!

3798
02:44:11,310 --> 02:44:13,070
All right.

3799
02:44:17,220 --> 02:44:18,440
The sand burn.

3800
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:19,400
Oh, hey.

3801
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:20,260
Him again.

3802
02:44:26,220 --> 02:44:32,940
Yeah, I guess so, I guess so.

3803
02:44:34,220 --> 02:44:38,190
Oh, hey.

3804
02:44:38,190 --> 02:44:38,490
What are you doing?

3805
02:44:40,430 --> 02:44:41,150
You're just going to say the cougar?

3806
02:44:41,150 --> 02:44:41,970
Oh yeah.

3807
02:44:41,970 --> 02:44:42,530
For now, I think.

3808
02:44:42,530 --> 02:44:43,310
He is going to take from you.

3809
02:44:44,450 --> 02:44:45,170
He ain't dog.

3810
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:50,980
He ain't dog.

3811
02:44:50,980 --> 02:44:51,240
No, he ain't.

3812
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:51,360
He ain't.

3813
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:55,360
Yeah, he's not that I say he ain't.

3814
02:44:55,740 --> 02:44:56,340
He's not.

3815
02:44:56,340 --> 02:44:56,880
Oh, my God.

3816
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:57,340
He's not going to give it back to me.

3817
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:58,120
One.

3818
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:01,880
He's not going to throw it back to me.

3819
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:01,900
He's going to throw it back to me.

3820
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:11,580
What the fuck did he give me?

3821
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:14,580
Oh!

3822
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:16,820
I finally have duplicate powers!

3823
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:21,060
Oh my god, the ladies are gonna love this.

3824
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:40,560
Alright, let's see.

3825
02:45:41,340 --> 02:45:42,500
Let's get that incense.

3826
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:50,200
Alright, rest time.

3827
02:45:52,380 --> 02:45:53,300
Alright, nice.

3828
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:55,140
Alright, uh, there's a door?

3829
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:57,480
It's not a door.

3830
02:45:58,200 --> 02:45:59,080
That's a wall.

3831
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:01,500
Oh.

3832
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:05,240
I found the rock.

3833
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:07,420
I did it!

3834
02:46:18,550 --> 02:46:19,570
Wait, where do we go?

3835
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:25,580
But like, there's stuff over here though.

3836
02:46:25,740 --> 02:46:26,380
I'm gonna go this way.

3837
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:29,460
I see stuff I want.

3838
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:31,840
Absorb.

3839
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:35,160
Have I ever opened the other door?

3840
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:36,020
Most likely not.

3841
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:37,460
I'm so fucking lost, guys.

3842
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:45,160
Like, this entire game I'm like just lost.

3843
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:45,740
Where are you?

3844
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:46,640
Are you crawling?

3845
02:46:46,860 --> 02:46:47,300
You're like a floor.

3846
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:50,880
Guys, we all learned how to walk on our two legs.

3847
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:52,060
What the fuck are you doing?

3848
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:56,560
The humans are gonna think we're freaks.

3849
02:46:56,740 --> 02:46:57,940
Oh, it's the weasel captain.

3850
02:47:00,820 --> 02:47:02,900
Guys, I did learn to...

3851
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:04,380
Before I...

3852
02:47:04,380 --> 02:47:05,940
What the fuck?

3853
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,280
What the fuck is that?

3854
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:11,640
Smack.

3855
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:13,880
Stop smacking yourself.

3856
02:47:14,460 --> 02:47:15,680
Stop smacking yourself.

3857
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:16,740
You know what?

3858
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:18,520
Let's grab all these guys too.

3859
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:20,560
Let's get them all in this action.

3860
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:21,660
That's fucking right.

3861
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:23,440
Ow.

3862
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:23,960
Ow.

3863
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:24,380
Okay.

3864
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:26,280
Alright, now I know what that is.

3865
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:27,840
Let's get them all in!

3866
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:30,340
Wait, I can get poisoned?

3867
02:47:30,660 --> 02:47:31,700
As the fox?

3868
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:33,260
As the what?

3869
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:36,240
Okay.

3870
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:38,340
Alright, we're fine.

3871
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:39,820
Everything is a-okay.

3872
02:47:41,360 --> 02:47:42,600
This is so easy.

3873
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:44,540
Oh no.

3874
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:45,300
Oh no.

3875
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:46,540
Wait, is he healing?

3876
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:47,780
Wait, he's healing?

3877
02:47:50,060 --> 02:47:51,300
That should be legal!

3878
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:54,260
Only I should be able to heal!

3879
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:55,680
Oh god.

3880
02:47:55,860 --> 02:47:56,860
Got the poison.

3881
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:00,440
No!

3882
02:48:00,660 --> 02:48:01,420
What the fuck?

3883
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:04,420
Friendly fire.

3884
02:48:05,860 --> 02:48:07,540
It's like, who are you?

3885
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:09,680
Sorry.

3886
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:10,980
There was some...

3887
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:13,940
Some unfortunate friendly fire action.

3888
02:48:13,960 --> 02:48:14,280
There.

3889
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:18,040
Whoops.

3890
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:22,920
Oh my god, I already used up all my...

3891
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:25,440
Jesus.

3892
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:29,460
It's fine.

3893
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:30,920
It's not greed.

3894
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:32,980
It's not greed because he's gonna die!

3895
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:34,840
Right here!

3896
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:36,920
Fucking easy.

3897
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:41,440
When the boss heals.

3898
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:43,600
When did I kill?

3899
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:44,340
Oh, there he is.

3900
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:46,140
The gore-eyed Taoist.

3901
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:50,260
A strange man with a lump on his back and a staff of blood red hue.

3902
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:52,600
He leaps and bounds with eerie might.

3903
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:54,660
Alright.

3904
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:55,960
Nice.

3905
02:48:57,240 --> 02:48:57,840
Oh!

3906
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:00,380
God.

3907
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:01,540
Fucking...

3908
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:02,480
Fucking...

3909
02:49:02,480 --> 02:49:04,460
I fucking knew it.

3910
02:49:04,480 --> 02:49:05,080
It's old.

3911
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:06,000
It's old.

3912
02:49:09,180 --> 02:49:09,780
Please.

3913
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:11,380
Oh, thank you.

3914
02:49:13,900 --> 02:49:14,860
Thank you.

3915
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:17,040
Bro, I'm trying to...

3916
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:18,540
BRO, I'M TRYING TO ABSORB!

3917
02:49:24,770 --> 02:49:26,070
Get out of here!

3918
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:28,550
I was trying to absorb.

3919
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:32,970
The invincibility frames, man.

3920
02:49:34,490 --> 02:49:36,290
Bro, why is he so tanky?

3921
02:49:38,730 --> 02:49:39,470
Oh, god.

3922
02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:39,870
Thank you.

3923
02:49:39,910 --> 02:49:40,490
Don't touch me.

3924
02:49:40,490 --> 02:49:41,890
Give me... give me six feet.

3925
02:49:42,290 --> 02:49:43,290
Nice, here you go.

3926
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:47,570
Thank god for the invincibility frames.

3927
02:49:51,390 --> 02:49:51,830
Oh!

3928
02:49:52,350 --> 02:49:53,490
Is that another Buddha?

3929
02:49:53,630 --> 02:49:54,130
Oh, nope.

3930
02:49:55,770 --> 02:49:56,210
Nope.

3931
02:49:57,590 --> 02:49:58,490
It's pretty though!

3932
02:49:59,490 --> 02:50:00,270
Free the nipple!

3933
02:50:01,710 --> 02:50:02,790
Alright, was that it?

3934
02:50:02,990 --> 02:50:03,850
Oh no, there's more here.

3935
02:50:07,540 --> 02:50:08,420
Never punished.

3936
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:13,760
Those mimics actually fuck with me though.

3937
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:15,140
Holy shit.

3938
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:19,540
Guys, I don't know if I'm flowing the right way.

3939
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:24,480
Like...

3940
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:25,740
I don't know!

3941
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:30,260
There's a door in there, but then there's a whole new pathway here!

3942
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:32,740
Where the fuck am I?

3943
02:50:35,720 --> 02:50:36,600
There's no...

3944
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:38,500
But where does this door go to?

3945
02:50:39,780 --> 02:50:41,360
Where... go where?

3946
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:42,600
Yes!

3947
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:49,920
I'm gonna go through that door.

3948
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:51,160
I'm gonna do it.

3949
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:53,700
I'm gonna go through that door.

3950
02:50:53,980 --> 02:50:55,040
But I'm gonna rest.

3951
02:51:00,420 --> 02:51:02,260
The yellow paint, Toki!

3952
02:51:02,320 --> 02:51:03,960
Follow the yellow paint!

3953
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:07,340
Alright.

3954
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:08,900
Let's see.

3955
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:11,040
Someone said I got Gord upgraded.

3956
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:11,980
Is that true?

3957
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:12,200
Nope.

3958
02:51:12,260 --> 02:51:13,220
That's a fucking lie.

3959
02:51:14,860 --> 02:51:15,040
Alright.

3960
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:18,140
That's progress?

3961
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:20,120
Then what the fuck is over there?

3962
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:23,540
Alright, we're gonna check out what's over there, I guess.

3963
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:27,560
Toki is turning to the west.

3964
02:51:27,620 --> 02:51:28,560
There's no other way.

3965
02:51:28,840 --> 02:51:29,920
Like, I don't know what to tell you.

3966
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:35,060
Alright, then we'll go this way and see what happens.

3967
02:51:37,300 --> 02:51:38,940
At least I can just run past these guys.

3968
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:39,520
They're not important.

3969
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:43,500
Follow the yellow brick road.

3970
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:44,500
Woo.

3971
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:47,340
I love gathering ingredients I'll never use.

3972
02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:49,280
Alright.

3973
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:50,540
Past the bridge.

3974
02:51:55,100 --> 02:51:56,300
Oh, shit.

3975
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:57,400
That's fine.

3976
02:51:57,660 --> 02:51:59,440
It's wolf time.

3977
02:51:59,560 --> 02:51:59,860
Wolf.

3978
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:03,320
Will I get any other transformation but wolf?

3979
02:52:03,640 --> 02:52:05,240
Why is it always wolf?

3980
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:09,940
Surely there's like somebody else, right?

3981
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:12,680
Nice.

3982
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:14,460
Why is it always wolf?

3983
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:15,920
Haha.

3984
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:19,640
When did I get two wolves?

3985
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:21,940
That's when things get spicy.

3986
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:26,520
Wait, he's still alive?

3987
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:28,100
Why is he still alive?

3988
02:52:28,220 --> 02:52:28,980
You were like 1 HP.

3989
02:52:32,060 --> 02:52:32,660
Wow!

3990
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:36,520
That was a good hiding spot.

3991
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:40,240
Oh no, there's more pathways?

3992
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:42,640
The coughing baby.

3993
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:42,940
Hey, little monkey.

3994
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:43,900
I'm here.

3995
02:52:44,320 --> 02:52:45,440
I don't have a bone.

3996
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:46,040
Shake it.

3997
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:46,660
Shake it.

3998
02:52:47,400 --> 02:52:47,680
Huh?

3999
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:53,180
What the fuck?

4000
02:52:54,880 --> 02:52:55,440
Child?

4001
02:53:02,890 --> 02:53:05,130
What the f- The wind and sand are gone.

4002
02:53:05,210 --> 02:53:06,030
I'll be fine.

4003
02:53:07,670 --> 02:53:08,230
What?

4004
02:53:09,390 --> 02:53:10,990
Look, you're a foreigner.

4005
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:12,730
Don't look at me like that.

4006
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:13,890
This place is so much fun.

4007
02:53:15,850 --> 02:53:17,330
The old man hiding in the rock.

4008
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:18,310
The old man hiding in the rock.

4009
02:53:18,310 --> 02:53:20,830
The pig that stole wine in the village.

4010
02:53:21,970 --> 02:53:23,690
And the manager...

4011
02:53:24,170 --> 02:53:25,490
I won't tell you.

4012
02:53:26,030 --> 02:53:27,990
I won't tell you.

4013
02:53:28,330 --> 02:53:30,370
Oh, you fucker!

4014
02:53:32,490 --> 02:53:34,330
You fucker.

4015
02:53:34,730 --> 02:53:38,530
I fucking hate mimics in any game.

4016
02:53:40,030 --> 02:53:43,190
It's mimics and poison swamps.

4017
02:53:47,260 --> 02:53:47,740
Alright.

4018
02:53:48,920 --> 02:53:52,460
How many kids does this monkey have?

4019
02:53:55,440 --> 02:53:56,260
What do you mean?

4020
02:53:56,500 --> 02:53:57,360
He didn't find the body.

4021
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:03,460
Wait, where do I go?

4022
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:05,200
What?

4023
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:07,560
What happened?

4024
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:11,120
Where do I go?

4025
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:11,720
Wait, what?

4026
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:14,600
Is that it?

4027
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:18,660
Oh.

4028
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:21,820
No, that's nothing.

4029
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:22,960
What?

4030
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:27,340
This is a dead end.

4031
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:34,160
Look up.

4032
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:37,480
But it's a dead end.

4033
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:42,120
Huh?

4034
02:54:47,030 --> 02:54:49,790
But we finally found him, the coughing baby.

4035
02:54:50,150 --> 02:54:51,830
The legends are true, chat.

4036
02:54:52,430 --> 02:54:53,030
What?

4037
02:54:53,430 --> 02:54:55,050
We finally found him.

4038
02:54:55,050 --> 02:54:56,270
We finally found the coughing baby.

4039
02:55:00,010 --> 02:55:02,450
Yeah, but where do I go for this quest?

4040
02:55:02,710 --> 02:55:03,810
Think 3D?

4041
02:55:04,230 --> 02:55:04,910
Here?

4042
02:55:07,670 --> 02:55:09,350
I'm thinking 3D.

4043
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:15,090
What do you mean, think 3D?

4044
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:23,160
The legend of the coughing baby.

4045
02:55:23,660 --> 02:55:24,940
It's true.

4046
02:55:25,460 --> 02:55:26,080
Oh!

4047
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:28,320
You fucking liar.

4048
02:55:28,420 --> 02:55:29,500
This is a fucking wall.

4049
02:55:30,380 --> 02:55:34,160
It's a, it's a wall, I can't go behind it.

4050
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:37,300
I got baited.

4051
02:55:38,740 --> 02:55:39,940
You mean look up?

4052
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:42,560
There's a bridge.

4053
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:43,720
Do I go to that bridge?

4054
02:55:44,040 --> 02:55:45,020
How do I get to that bridge?

4055
02:55:52,030 --> 02:55:52,970
Oh, it's a dead end.

4056
02:55:53,090 --> 02:55:53,650
Oh, thank God.

4057
02:55:55,350 --> 02:56:00,410
Thank God, for back seaters.

4058
02:56:00,550 --> 02:56:04,010
You guys would have, and I know you guys would have tried to kill me.

4059
02:56:09,490 --> 02:56:15,450
I know you guys would try to make me stay there for 20 more minutes.

4060
02:56:15,590 --> 02:56:18,330
Just to be like, Doki, you got one guy.

4061
02:56:22,170 --> 02:56:24,130
This was going to be a one guy moment.

4062
02:56:24,250 --> 02:56:25,250
You think I don't know that?

4063
02:56:25,330 --> 02:56:28,050
You think I don't know what you guys will do to me?

4064
02:56:30,370 --> 02:56:31,570
Hey, there's too many.

4065
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:40,470
I hate it when there's so many fucking doors.

4066
02:56:46,310 --> 02:56:47,730
Wait, that door doesn't work.

4067
02:56:47,890 --> 02:56:48,210
Okay.

4068
02:56:50,630 --> 02:56:53,290
There's so many doors, but that one door doesn't work.

4069
02:56:53,430 --> 02:56:54,490
Alright, that's good to know.

4070
02:56:55,430 --> 02:56:57,470
The chosen one guy.

4071
02:57:01,150 --> 02:57:02,970
Alright, I guess we go this way then.

4072
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:07,120
Oh!

4073
02:57:07,560 --> 02:57:08,860
The other door.

4074
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:11,460
Open sesame!

4075
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:15,520
Where am I?

4076
02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:18,200
Where is this place?

4077
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:23,220
Okay, that scared me.

4078
02:57:24,780 --> 02:57:27,980
I don't like this cave.

4079
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:29,900
Wait, isn't that the...

4080
02:57:30,220 --> 02:57:30,580
Wait!

4081
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:34,880
Isn't that the cave where I killed the child?

4082
02:57:35,740 --> 02:57:36,680
No, this is not.

4083
02:57:36,740 --> 02:57:37,240
Wait, is it?

4084
02:57:39,300 --> 02:57:42,400
Wait, is this the same... I don't know where I am.

4085
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:45,040
Yeah, this is where I killed the child.

4086
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:48,820
Oh, I found a shortcut!

4087
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:51,800
But what am I going to do here?

4088
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:56,620
Why am I here?

4089
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:58,060
Just to suffer?

4090
02:57:58,400 --> 02:58:00,440
And then this is where I killed the man back.

4091
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:04,540
What is that?

4092
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:05,000
The village?

4093
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:05,920
Where's the village?

4094
02:58:06,220 --> 02:58:07,220
Is it west?

4095
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:11,180
It's the village west.

4096
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:13,700
Guess where...

4097
02:58:13,700 --> 02:58:15,200
Where's the village?

4098
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:17,420
Well, there's the temple.

4099
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:22,120
That's the temple where I killed the fucking tiger.

4100
02:58:26,390 --> 02:58:29,230
Isn't that the item for the... the thing?

4101
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:29,890
Here too?

4102
02:58:31,430 --> 02:58:33,130
Everything is west.

4103
02:58:33,130 --> 02:58:36,050
Is it also west, guys?

4104
02:58:41,890 --> 02:58:42,450
Alright.

4105
02:58:42,890 --> 02:58:44,410
Can I activate this now?

4106
02:58:44,610 --> 02:58:45,650
I should be able to.

4107
02:58:47,270 --> 02:58:48,910
This is where I killed Tony the Tiger.

4108
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:53,680
Whoa!

4109
02:58:57,650 --> 02:58:58,210
Dad?

4110
02:59:03,210 --> 02:59:04,450
What the fuck?

4111
02:59:06,310 --> 02:59:08,730
This is... that's an Aladdin moment right here.

4112
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:15,440
Tony's dad?

4113
02:59:15,980 --> 02:59:17,340
Cave of Wonders?

4114
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,360
Whoa, what's that?

4115
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:28,160
What is this?

4116
02:59:33,610 --> 02:59:34,870
More zombies.

4117
02:59:35,890 --> 02:59:36,690
Okay.

4118
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:38,990
Oh, more sick!

4119
02:59:42,830 --> 02:59:43,610
Thank God!

4120
02:59:43,870 --> 02:59:46,090
Thank God there's so many bugs here!

4121
02:59:48,950 --> 02:59:49,390
Nice.

4122
02:59:50,370 --> 02:59:51,550
Alright, I love loot.

4123
02:59:52,350 --> 02:59:53,110
Loot, loot, loot.

4124
02:59:55,930 --> 02:59:57,630
Oh, increases maximum health.

4125
02:59:57,830 --> 02:59:58,770
Okay, I definitely need that.

4126
03:00:02,610 --> 03:00:03,850
We're gonna kill another god.

4127
03:00:06,650 --> 03:00:08,950
This has to be a boss, right?

4128
03:00:11,230 --> 03:00:12,550
Like what else could it be?

4129
03:00:12,730 --> 03:00:14,110
What the fuck are you?

4130
03:00:16,910 --> 03:00:17,350
Phew!

4131
03:00:17,430 --> 03:00:17,630
Oh, I'm dead!

4132
03:00:17,630 --> 03:00:18,430
Oh shit!

4133
03:00:18,470 --> 03:00:19,430
Oh, there's so many!

4134
03:00:20,850 --> 03:00:21,870
Too many!

4135
03:00:22,010 --> 03:00:23,190
Too many children!

4136
03:00:25,710 --> 03:00:28,630
Oh my god, how many are there?

4137
03:00:29,470 --> 03:00:31,230
Holy shit!

4138
03:00:32,750 --> 03:00:34,030
How many?

4139
03:00:34,410 --> 03:00:36,390
We have a problem!

4140
03:00:36,750 --> 03:00:38,270
Oh shit!

4141
03:00:38,490 --> 03:00:39,650
Oh, they're so fast.

4142
03:00:40,230 --> 03:00:41,910
They're actually so fast.

4143
03:00:44,610 --> 03:00:47,710
Oh my god, they're so fucking fast.

4144
03:00:48,670 --> 03:00:49,970
Too many wine!

4145
03:00:50,210 --> 03:00:51,850
Too many corn wine!

4146
03:00:52,430 --> 03:00:54,930
Too many corn wine!

4147
03:00:57,370 --> 03:00:58,190
Oh god.

4148
03:00:58,750 --> 03:00:59,630
This is it.

4149
03:01:02,310 --> 03:01:03,290
There you go.

4150
03:01:03,350 --> 03:01:04,110
Now I can chill.

4151
03:01:04,270 --> 03:01:05,310
Oh, I cannot chill.

4152
03:01:05,450 --> 03:01:06,090
Never mind.

4153
03:01:07,110 --> 03:01:08,690
Use all your magic!

4154
03:01:11,910 --> 03:01:12,990
Guess it was worth it.

4155
03:01:13,050 --> 03:01:14,930
Guys, I had to.

4156
03:01:14,990 --> 03:01:16,790
I had to use everything.

4157
03:01:17,370 --> 03:01:18,450
I can't.

4158
03:01:18,450 --> 03:01:20,890
I cannot deal with all of them.

4159
03:01:24,290 --> 03:01:27,590
And thus all my magic is now gone.

4160
03:01:29,650 --> 03:01:30,630
Worth it.

4161
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:35,330
When you get bullied in PE.

4162
03:01:36,810 --> 03:01:38,310
Guess it was worth it.

4163
03:01:38,450 --> 03:01:40,890
We might need to fight somebody here later.

4164
03:01:41,910 --> 03:01:42,170
I don't understand.

4165
03:01:42,390 --> 03:01:43,030
It was worth it.

4166
03:01:50,640 --> 03:01:53,280
I wish, like, mana regenerates.

4167
03:01:53,540 --> 03:01:56,260
I guess, like, it'd be too OP, I guess.

4168
03:01:56,600 --> 03:01:58,700
But, like, god, it's so frustrating.

4169
03:01:59,120 --> 03:01:59,820
You know?

4170
03:02:01,820 --> 03:02:05,160
It's so frustrating that you can only, like... Oh, it's slide time!

4171
03:02:06,040 --> 03:02:06,520
Yay!

4172
03:02:07,120 --> 03:02:07,460
Ooh.

4173
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:08,740
Oh, wait, what?

4174
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:10,380
There's an incense here.

4175
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:12,780
Okay, nice.

4176
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:15,080
It'd be nice.

4177
03:02:16,760 --> 03:02:18,500
Oh, there's mana regen later?

4178
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:19,360
Oh, thank god.

4179
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:21,260
I feel like...

4180
03:02:22,360 --> 03:02:22,880
Um...

4181
03:02:24,040 --> 03:02:24,560
Um...

4182
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:27,840
I feel like it would definitely be a lot better.

4183
03:02:30,040 --> 03:02:32,780
If, like, we definitely have, like, mana regen.

4184
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:40,100
It's just very frustrating that, um, I have to always go to the rest stop for it.

4185
03:02:42,360 --> 03:02:44,560
I guess spells are pretty overpowered.

4186
03:02:44,580 --> 03:02:44,880
Yeah.

4187
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:47,400
I guess it'll make the game way too easy.

4188
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:49,660
Wait, what's this?

4189
03:02:51,900 --> 03:02:52,980
Is it just decoration?

4190
03:02:54,300 --> 03:02:56,000
I assume, like, I don't know.

4191
03:02:56,020 --> 03:02:56,780
It's a different color.

4192
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:02,420
What if I mega smash it?

4193
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:04,220
Wait, what does this do?

4194
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:06,160
Is it just... decoration?

4195
03:03:16,470 --> 03:03:17,190
It's light.

4196
03:03:21,050 --> 03:03:22,450
It's just light.

4197
03:03:22,630 --> 03:03:23,910
I missed the NPC.

4198
03:03:24,170 --> 03:03:24,930
There's an NPC?

4199
03:03:27,890 --> 03:03:28,450
Whoa.

4200
03:03:28,930 --> 03:03:30,170
Yippee, the slide.

4201
03:03:31,930 --> 03:03:33,550
How did I miss an NPC?

4202
03:03:36,570 --> 03:03:37,990
Oh my god.

4203
03:03:38,050 --> 03:03:39,150
Okay, let's...

4204
03:03:39,150 --> 03:03:41,550
Apparently, I have a gourd update too.

4205
03:03:41,830 --> 03:03:42,770
No, I don't.

4206
03:03:43,330 --> 03:03:44,710
No, I fucking don't.

4207
03:03:44,710 --> 03:03:45,110
What?

4208
03:03:49,710 --> 03:03:50,290
Okay.

4209
03:03:52,510 --> 03:03:53,090
Travel.

4210
03:03:53,310 --> 03:03:54,310
Where was it?

4211
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:58,810
Here?

4212
03:04:00,590 --> 03:04:01,770
Oh, temple entrance.

4213
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:12,780
Oh, I have to go to Hong Kong Monkey.

4214
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:13,840
Okay.

4215
03:04:14,360 --> 03:04:16,180
Wait, I can travel between chapters?

4216
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:18,800
I thought I was stuck in sand forever!

4217
03:04:19,660 --> 03:04:21,020
I didn't realize.

4218
03:04:21,300 --> 03:04:22,180
Oh my god.

4219
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:23,760
Why do I never realize this?

4220
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:27,240
I legitimately thought I was stuck in sand forever.

4221
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:28,400
Okay.

4222
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:32,380
Oh my god, I can go back to the Hong Kong Monkey.

4223
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:37,980
Why would you ever want to leave Sand Land, Doki?

4224
03:04:38,180 --> 03:04:40,080
Why would you ever want to leave?

4225
03:04:43,620 --> 03:04:44,480
We are...

4226
03:04:44,480 --> 03:04:46,340
We aren't trapped?

4227
03:04:47,740 --> 03:04:51,640
Alright, while we wait for this to load, I need to go grab some water.

4228
03:04:51,740 --> 03:04:52,200
I'll be right back.

4229
03:04:52,400 --> 03:04:53,520
I drank up all my water.

4230
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:54,340
Oh, well, we're here.

4231
03:04:54,540 --> 03:04:55,820
I'm still gonna make you guys wait.

4232
03:06:02,860 --> 03:06:03,540
I'm back.

4233
03:06:04,380 --> 03:06:06,220
Sorry, I had to kick Dad out too.

4234
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:09,160
Because he was like, Can I come inside now?

4235
03:06:09,480 --> 03:06:10,720
And I was like, Nope, nope.

4236
03:06:11,020 --> 03:06:11,680
Turn around.

4237
03:06:12,400 --> 03:06:13,020
Turn around.

4238
03:06:16,980 --> 03:06:19,040
Not inside the PC room.

4239
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:20,300
Not inside the office.

4240
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:21,420
Hello, Hong Kong Monkey.

4241
03:06:24,720 --> 03:06:25,640
Yo, Joe.

4242
03:06:25,700 --> 03:06:26,240
Choo choo.

4243
03:06:26,980 --> 03:06:28,140
Alright, let's see.

4244
03:06:28,140 --> 03:06:30,280
Oh my god, I can upgrade so much.

4245
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:32,060
Wait, is this the...

4246
03:06:32,060 --> 03:06:33,020
Wait, is this the...

4247
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:33,880
Oh, wait, no, this is normal.

4248
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:34,180
Okay.

4249
03:06:37,460 --> 03:06:38,660
Alright, upgrade drinks.

4250
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:39,080
Oh!

4251
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:41,280
Recovers more health.

4252
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:41,820
Whoa!

4253
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:44,580
Don't talk to me.

4254
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:45,160
And now at the...

4255
03:06:46,220 --> 03:06:48,040
It's time to bring out the fancy wine.

4256
03:06:51,140 --> 03:06:53,780
I got the fancy wine now.

4257
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:58,960
Man, Doki, you've changed.

4258
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:01,540
Ever since you got that five-year coconut wine.

4259
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:03,980
Oh my god, you've changed, Doki.

4260
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:09,660
I'm starting my wine mom era.

4261
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:15,000
Travel.

4262
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:18,000
What's the town called, guys?

4263
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:21,340
Is this the village entrance?

4264
03:07:23,880 --> 03:07:25,720
Is it the entrance of the...

4265
03:07:25,720 --> 03:07:27,600
The boxed wine auntie.

4266
03:07:27,600 --> 03:07:28,340
Yeah, yeah.

4267
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:30,400
I'm the wine aunt now.

4268
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:33,900
I got the...

4269
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:37,400
Alright.

4270
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:47,380
There was a frog?

4271
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:51,200
I clearly have not been registering.

4272
03:07:52,360 --> 03:07:54,820
It's like, there was a frog?

4273
03:07:55,520 --> 03:07:57,700
I did not meet a frog.

4274
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,580
I went straight to killing a boss.

4275
03:08:08,600 --> 03:08:09,880
Go backwards?

4276
03:08:12,140 --> 03:08:13,420
Go down?

4277
03:08:16,240 --> 03:08:16,880
Here?

4278
03:08:17,780 --> 03:08:20,460
Oh, you can tell I've never been here before.

4279
03:08:25,940 --> 03:08:29,180
You can tell I've never been down here.

4280
03:08:32,700 --> 03:08:33,560
Who's this?

4281
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:35,720
Oh, wait.

4282
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:36,320
Wait, you're an NPC!

4283
03:08:52,020 --> 03:08:53,180
Oh, okay.

4284
03:08:54,200 --> 03:08:56,180
Oh my god, somebody I don't kill.

4285
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:57,840
That's new.

4286
03:08:59,220 --> 03:09:00,400
Oh, there he is!

4287
03:09:00,960 --> 03:09:01,880
Hello frog!

4288
03:09:02,640 --> 03:09:03,500
Good frog?

4289
03:09:04,180 --> 03:09:05,080
Not good frog!

4290
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:05,860
Not good frog!

4291
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:08,400
Okay.

4292
03:09:10,800 --> 03:09:12,400
Guys, it was not a good frog.

4293
03:09:13,240 --> 03:09:14,200
I thought...

4294
03:09:15,320 --> 03:09:16,900
I thought he was...

4295
03:09:17,380 --> 03:09:18,940
I thought he was a good frog.

4296
03:09:19,060 --> 03:09:19,620
I don't know.

4297
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:22,780
I don't know why I thought so.

4298
03:09:23,260 --> 03:09:24,640
I thought it'd be different.

4299
03:09:24,920 --> 03:09:27,820
Wait, he can interrupt my moves?!

4300
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:29,800
That should be illegal!

4301
03:09:33,500 --> 03:09:33,920
He did!

4302
03:09:34,020 --> 03:09:35,860
He interrupted my moves!

4303
03:09:37,020 --> 03:09:38,620
Oh my god!

4304
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:41,700
That's fucked.

4305
03:09:42,120 --> 03:09:43,400
That's actually fucked.

4306
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:45,100
I didn't know he could do that.

4307
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:46,540
Oh my god!

4308
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:50,610
I'm fighting...

4309
03:09:50,610 --> 03:09:54,050
And then I got bored.

4310
03:09:54,990 --> 03:09:55,750
Goodbye.

4311
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:03,200
I

4312
03:10:07,640 --> 03:10:10,040
was not expecting that!

4313
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:13,440
I thought, you know...

4314
03:10:13,440 --> 03:10:17,720
I thought the fox was like, go talk to him, see what he wants.

4315
03:10:17,740 --> 03:10:18,680
And I was like, okay.

4316
03:10:18,960 --> 03:10:20,620
I didn't realize he was...

4317
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:23,020
I thought we were going to have a negotiation.

4318
03:10:23,780 --> 03:10:25,800
You know, like have a little debate.

4319
03:10:25,940 --> 03:10:26,740
A little conversation.

4320
03:10:28,020 --> 03:10:29,300
I didn't think...

4321
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:32,960
I didn't think he was going to beat me up.

4322
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:34,480
I was just doing an errand.

4323
03:10:34,880 --> 03:10:37,260
I was just doing a fucking errand.

4324
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:39,540
I was just doing a fucking errand.

4325
03:10:40,480 --> 03:10:41,240
Okay.

4326
03:10:43,400 --> 03:10:45,560
The frog is not friend.

4327
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:50,280
The frog is not friend.

4328
03:10:50,480 --> 03:10:51,300
Who would have thought?

4329
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:54,580
Frog not friend.

4330
03:10:56,560 --> 03:10:58,000
I can't wear pants!

4331
03:10:58,540 --> 03:11:00,000
Why is frog not friendly?

4332
03:11:02,280 --> 03:11:03,040
Okay.

4333
03:11:03,660 --> 03:11:05,460
Thank god at least...

4334
03:11:06,500 --> 03:11:07,260
Smack!

4335
03:11:08,240 --> 03:11:09,000
Smack!

4336
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:09,480
I learned how to smack.

4337
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:11,700
Oh.

4338
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:12,620
Oh.

4339
03:11:12,700 --> 03:11:13,140
Whoa.

4340
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:13,620
Whoa.

4341
03:11:13,620 --> 03:11:13,960
Whoa.

4342
03:11:13,960 --> 03:11:14,380
Whoa.

4343
03:11:14,380 --> 03:11:14,820
Whoa.

4344
03:11:14,820 --> 03:11:15,040
Whoa.

4345
03:11:15,100 --> 03:11:16,100
This is not fair!

4346
03:11:16,760 --> 03:11:18,200
This is not fair!

4347
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:21,780
Jesus!

4348
03:11:22,420 --> 03:11:22,920
Oh!

4349
03:11:27,350 --> 03:11:29,750
What the fuck is wrong with this frog?

4350
03:11:32,650 --> 03:11:33,850
Oh my god.

4351
03:11:35,490 --> 03:11:35,990
Okay.

4352
03:11:36,090 --> 03:11:37,970
I'm like not feeling so good right now.

4353
03:11:38,070 --> 03:11:38,290
My...

4354
03:11:38,290 --> 03:11:39,890
My guy is not feeling so good.

4355
03:11:39,890 --> 03:11:40,170
He...

4356
03:11:40,170 --> 03:11:42,910
He has a lot of electricity issues right now.

4357
03:11:43,050 --> 03:11:43,530
He...

4358
03:11:43,530 --> 03:11:44,770
Oh my god.

4359
03:11:44,790 --> 03:11:47,570
He has a lot of electricity issues at the moment!

4360
03:11:54,470 --> 03:11:56,070
Let me stun you.

4361
03:11:56,190 --> 03:11:57,790
Let me fucking stun you.

4362
03:11:59,870 --> 03:12:00,430
Boom!

4363
03:12:07,780 --> 03:12:08,840
We did it.

4364
03:12:08,880 --> 03:12:09,680
We got Tab.

4365
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:11,020
We got his babies too.

4366
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:12,200
We...

4367
03:12:12,200 --> 03:12:13,780
Holy shit!

4368
03:12:15,360 --> 03:12:16,420
We got the kids.

4369
03:12:16,420 --> 03:12:16,600
We're getting the kids.

4370
03:12:19,460 --> 03:12:20,860
Dude don't Mind, please.

4371
03:12:21,100 --> 03:12:22,400
I got the children.

4372
03:12:31,130 --> 03:12:34,970
Are you seeing mashing the children in the pot!?

4373
03:12:34,970 --> 03:12:35,690
Masha+.

4374
03:12:37,090 --> 03:12:38,250
Just tell Masha in fact.

4375
03:12:47,170 --> 03:12:48,980
Come she sort out herself off.

4376
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:52,300
No, no, no, no.

4377
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:52,360
No.

4378
03:12:54,180 --> 03:12:55,280
I remember this...

4379
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:55,380
That.

4380
03:12:59,560 --> 03:13:00,160
Aw.

4381
03:13:00,160 --> 03:13:01,880
I got medicine.

4382
03:13:03,700 --> 03:13:04,300
Okay.

4383
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:06,560
Fix the zoom box?

4384
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:07,200
How so?

4385
03:13:08,240 --> 03:13:11,520
The zoom... it didn't cut off anything.

4386
03:13:11,960 --> 03:13:13,340
I was looking at it.

4387
03:13:16,520 --> 03:13:18,080
Now go to the place.

4388
03:13:18,220 --> 03:13:18,460
Okay.

4389
03:13:18,760 --> 03:13:20,000
Back to the place.

4390
03:13:23,180 --> 03:13:24,200
Where is it?

4391
03:13:25,940 --> 03:13:27,080
It gets cut off?

4392
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:27,420
Where?

4393
03:13:28,180 --> 03:13:29,180
Like the bottom?

4394
03:13:29,440 --> 03:13:32,720
Oh, I

4395
03:13:37,540 --> 03:13:39,140
didn't see... I didn't realize there were two lines.

4396
03:13:39,900 --> 03:13:41,380
I was like looking at it.

4397
03:13:43,300 --> 03:13:48,520
Where do I go?

4398
03:13:49,940 --> 03:13:51,920
Do I go back to the temple?

4399
03:13:52,580 --> 03:13:53,360
Is that it?

4400
03:13:53,500 --> 03:13:54,840
Oh, that's not what I want to do.

4401
03:13:55,720 --> 03:13:56,640
Where am I?

4402
03:13:57,440 --> 03:13:57,920
Where am I?

4403
03:14:05,900 --> 03:14:07,060
Oh, that's the arrow.

4404
03:14:08,240 --> 03:14:09,080
Oh, there it is.

4405
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:09,460
There it is.

4406
03:14:09,460 --> 03:14:09,980
I found it.

4407
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:15,620
Oh, I found it.

4408
03:14:16,100 --> 03:14:17,940
Oh, I can make medicine now.

4409
03:14:21,400 --> 03:14:24,240
That's funny that they think I'm going to use that.

4410
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:27,200
Okay.

4411
03:14:28,440 --> 03:14:29,200
Down here.

4412
03:14:37,220 --> 03:14:38,340
There it is.

4413
03:14:46,530 --> 03:14:47,450
All right.

4414
03:14:47,690 --> 03:14:52,730
Now that I'm here, I'm ready to talk.

4415
03:14:52,930 --> 03:14:53,350
What?

4416
03:14:53,930 --> 03:14:54,810
Where's the NPC?

4417
03:14:57,490 --> 03:14:59,030
There's a well in the village?

4418
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:03,270
Oh,

4419
03:15:16,830 --> 03:15:18,530
he's like... he liked the thing.

4420
03:15:19,870 --> 03:15:20,510
Oh,

4421
03:15:24,910 --> 03:15:25,310
he's like...

4422
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:25,310
he liked the thing.

4423
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:28,550
Oh, he's like... he liked the thing.

4424
03:15:29,970 --> 03:15:30,870
He's a dog?

4425
03:15:39,250 --> 03:15:41,230
Who let this dog cook?

4426
03:15:43,070 --> 03:15:44,350
Oh, I got a mine core.

4427
03:15:44,510 --> 03:15:44,790
Nice.

4428
03:15:45,930 --> 03:15:47,310
And what is this?

4429
03:15:48,410 --> 03:15:49,010
Uh...

4430
03:15:49,730 --> 03:15:51,390
Upon use considerably...

4431
03:15:51,390 --> 03:15:52,990
Oh, it increases maximum health.

4432
03:15:53,730 --> 03:15:54,390
All right.

4433
03:15:56,630 --> 03:15:57,110
Okay.

4434
03:15:57,230 --> 03:15:58,330
Does it do it forever?

4435
03:16:01,940 --> 03:16:03,000
It seems like...

4436
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:03,880
Does this do it forever?

4437
03:16:04,920 --> 03:16:05,640
Or nah?

4438
03:16:06,360 --> 03:16:07,060
Or like...

4439
03:16:07,060 --> 03:16:08,220
It's like temporary.

4440
03:16:08,680 --> 03:16:09,760
For a few minutes.

4441
03:16:09,920 --> 03:16:10,160
Okay.

4442
03:16:10,200 --> 03:16:10,980
No, fuck that shit.

4443
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:11,740
You're not scamming me.

4444
03:16:13,240 --> 03:16:14,080
You're not...

4445
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:15,800
You're not scamming me.

4446
03:16:17,020 --> 03:16:17,960
Oh, there we go.

4447
03:16:18,140 --> 03:16:18,620
Now...

4448
03:16:18,620 --> 03:16:20,460
Now I can make actual medicine.

4449
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:21,740
All right.

4450
03:16:21,800 --> 03:16:22,420
Let's see.

4451
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:23,460
I have...

4452
03:16:24,480 --> 03:16:25,100
Maximum mana.

4453
03:16:25,440 --> 03:16:25,840
Stamina.

4454
03:16:26,140 --> 03:16:26,540
Defense.

4455
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:29,840
Stamina.

4456
03:16:31,480 --> 03:16:32,280
Increases stamina.

4457
03:16:32,480 --> 03:16:33,320
Recovery rate.

4458
03:16:33,820 --> 03:16:34,620
Chill resistance.

4459
03:16:35,240 --> 03:16:35,400
Wait.

4460
03:16:35,440 --> 03:16:36,040
What should I get?

4461
03:16:37,320 --> 03:16:37,720
Guys.

4462
03:16:37,840 --> 03:16:39,180
What would be the best?

4463
03:16:39,360 --> 03:16:40,260
There's no damage.

4464
03:16:40,440 --> 03:16:41,060
So like now...

4465
03:16:41,060 --> 03:16:41,840
I don't know what...

4466
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:43,120
Now it's hopeless for me.

4467
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:45,100
Guys.

4468
03:16:45,260 --> 03:16:46,860
When there's no damage, I don't know what to do.

4469
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:52,160
What do I do?

4470
03:16:52,220 --> 03:16:52,880
There's no damage.

4471
03:16:54,040 --> 03:16:54,560
Okay.

4472
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:55,340
We'll do it.

4473
03:16:55,360 --> 03:16:55,900
We'll do HP.

4474
03:17:04,480 --> 03:17:05,460
He did not...

4475
03:17:05,460 --> 03:17:06,980
You know what he's saying there.

4476
03:17:14,820 --> 03:17:15,860
All right.

4477
03:17:15,860 --> 03:17:16,160
Nice.

4478
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:16,580
Plus...

4479
03:17:16,580 --> 03:17:18,300
Is he going to do that every time?

4480
03:17:20,200 --> 03:17:20,720
That's...

4481
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:23,020
I don't think I'd like that.

4482
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:26,620
I'm just thinking.

4483
03:17:26,740 --> 03:17:27,160
Oh, no.

4484
03:17:27,200 --> 03:17:29,200
Is he going to do that every fucking time?

4485
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:32,140
Every time I'm trying...

4486
03:17:35,020 --> 03:17:35,420
Okay.

4487
03:17:35,980 --> 03:17:36,960
Should I get...

4488
03:17:36,960 --> 03:17:37,700
What should I...

4489
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:38,360
Now mana?

4490
03:17:39,740 --> 03:17:40,480
Oh, I can skip.

4491
03:17:40,600 --> 03:17:41,260
Oh, thank God.

4492
03:17:41,300 --> 03:17:41,740
I can...

4493
03:17:42,640 --> 03:17:43,740
Oh, thank God.

4494
03:17:43,780 --> 03:17:44,780
I was going to say...

4495
03:17:46,140 --> 03:17:47,480
That's way too long.

4496
03:17:52,670 --> 03:17:53,270
All right.

4497
03:17:54,010 --> 03:17:54,750
And I see...

4498
03:17:54,750 --> 03:17:55,410
I still have...

4499
03:17:55,410 --> 03:17:56,210
I have two more.

4500
03:17:56,990 --> 03:17:58,530
Where do I put the last two in?

4501
03:17:58,670 --> 03:17:58,970
Chat.

4502
03:18:00,950 --> 03:18:01,570
Mana too?

4503
03:18:02,090 --> 03:18:02,730
Still mana?

4504
03:18:05,610 --> 03:18:06,010
Or...

4505
03:18:06,010 --> 03:18:07,710
Yeah, but I don't have a lot of mine core.

4506
03:18:07,890 --> 03:18:08,570
That's the thing.

4507
03:18:09,350 --> 03:18:11,690
I have to do it one by one because I don't have a lot.

4508
03:18:11,890 --> 03:18:13,050
I only had like seven.

4509
03:18:14,490 --> 03:18:15,370
Do I do...

4510
03:18:15,370 --> 03:18:15,970
Mana...

4511
03:18:16,450 --> 03:18:17,650
Stamina recovery rate...

4512
03:18:17,650 --> 03:18:19,030
Stam recovery rate is also good.

4513
03:18:19,130 --> 03:18:20,110
I'll do two then for it.

4514
03:18:20,270 --> 03:18:21,510
I'll just use up both of them.

4515
03:18:23,270 --> 03:18:23,770
All right.

4516
03:18:24,110 --> 03:18:24,510
Okay.

4517
03:18:24,510 --> 03:18:24,730
Okay.

4518
03:18:24,730 --> 03:18:25,070
Nice.

4519
03:18:26,950 --> 03:18:27,390
Yay.

4520
03:18:31,290 --> 03:18:31,730
Okay.

4521
03:18:32,170 --> 03:18:34,350
We go...

4522
03:18:34,830 --> 03:18:35,450
All right.

4523
03:18:35,490 --> 03:18:36,570
The Children Well.

4524
03:18:37,530 --> 03:18:38,330
Where's the well?

4525
03:18:42,550 --> 03:18:43,610
Where is the well?

4526
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:44,650
Is it still at the village?

4527
03:18:45,090 --> 03:18:46,950
I assume it's still at the village entrance.

4528
03:18:50,170 --> 03:18:50,610
Behind.

4529
03:18:50,830 --> 03:18:52,070
Can I open the door now?

4530
03:18:52,250 --> 03:18:53,630
Do I have to kill them to open the door?

4531
03:18:54,270 --> 03:18:54,710
Can I?

4532
03:18:54,710 --> 03:18:56,310
How the fuck do I get in?

4533
03:19:01,280 --> 03:19:03,400
I never figured out how to get in that door.

4534
03:19:06,420 --> 03:19:07,480
Wait, where am I?

4535
03:19:09,500 --> 03:19:11,600
Oh shit, I've never explored this.

4536
03:19:15,980 --> 03:19:18,180
Oh, it can be open from the other side.

4537
03:19:18,240 --> 03:19:19,220
Guys, it's time.

4538
03:19:19,580 --> 03:19:21,540
It's time to finally explore.

4539
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:27,260
We never explored this area.

4540
03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:35,780
Finally, after defeating 500 other bosses, it's finally time to figure out where to go.

4541
03:19:41,450 --> 03:19:43,470
Oh my god, what the fuck did he do?

4542
03:19:43,850 --> 03:19:45,490
Oh, he tried to sparta me.

4543
03:19:45,790 --> 03:19:46,430
That's what.

4544
03:19:47,470 --> 03:19:48,530
What the fuck?

4545
03:19:48,570 --> 03:19:49,870
Where did you come from?

4546
03:19:54,550 --> 03:19:55,370
Rubbing it up.

4547
03:19:57,330 --> 03:19:58,230
Get over here.

4548
03:19:58,310 --> 03:19:58,530
Boom.

4549
03:19:58,790 --> 03:19:59,650
There we go.

4550
03:19:59,690 --> 03:20:00,650
No more fucking shields.

4551
03:20:00,730 --> 03:20:01,010
For you.

4552
03:20:02,410 --> 03:20:04,110
Sorry, it took me a while to rev that up.

4553
03:20:04,910 --> 03:20:05,270
Alright.

4554
03:20:06,970 --> 03:20:08,850
Where the fuck do I go to the other side?

4555
03:20:09,950 --> 03:20:10,310
Here?

4556
03:20:12,630 --> 03:20:13,530
That's where I went.

4557
03:20:15,530 --> 03:20:16,830
Oh, I guess it's here, right?

4558
03:20:17,650 --> 03:20:18,770
Oh, he's back?

4559
03:20:19,110 --> 03:20:19,930
No, fuck that.

4560
03:20:20,950 --> 03:20:22,570
I do not want to deal with that.

4561
03:20:24,150 --> 03:20:26,190
You're gonna have to chase me all the way here.

4562
03:20:27,450 --> 03:20:29,070
Okay, he's still chasing me, guys.

4563
03:20:29,290 --> 03:20:30,510
I thought he would stop.

4564
03:20:30,730 --> 03:20:33,050
You're gonna have to chase me all the way here.

4565
03:20:37,750 --> 03:20:41,350
Oh, but what if I have all of these guys here?

4566
03:20:41,890 --> 03:20:42,810
Yeah, that's right.

4567
03:20:44,210 --> 03:20:45,890
And then I'm gonna do this too.

4568
03:20:49,710 --> 03:20:51,570
Which one's the real monkey?

4569
03:20:51,790 --> 03:20:52,550
I say.

4570
03:20:53,630 --> 03:20:54,890
You'll never find me.

4571
03:20:56,510 --> 03:20:58,290
Which one's the real monkey?

4572
03:20:58,290 --> 03:20:58,430
Monkey!

4573
03:21:01,770 --> 03:21:03,010
Who could it be?

4574
03:21:05,470 --> 03:21:07,790
Jesus Christ, he's so tanky.

4575
03:21:07,790 --> 03:21:08,870
I hate this rat guy.

4576
03:21:12,050 --> 03:21:12,930
Alright, nice.

4577
03:21:13,610 --> 03:21:15,190
How do I get up there though?

4578
03:21:16,070 --> 03:21:16,510
Wait.

4579
03:21:16,670 --> 03:21:18,090
Oh no, is that the wizard?

4580
03:21:18,490 --> 03:21:19,210
Oh no.

4581
03:21:19,690 --> 03:21:20,330
It's him.

4582
03:21:21,630 --> 03:21:23,350
Oh no, it's the weaker version of him.

4583
03:21:23,390 --> 03:21:23,930
He's not him.

4584
03:21:24,870 --> 03:21:25,530
Thank God.

4585
03:21:25,530 --> 03:21:28,110
Okay, I had like PTSD from that one wizard.

4586
03:21:29,890 --> 03:21:32,990
Look, that one wizard was very scary.

4587
03:21:33,210 --> 03:21:33,570
No!

4588
03:21:33,910 --> 03:21:35,950
The stupid fucking arrows!

4589
03:21:40,530 --> 03:21:41,050
Alright.

4590
03:21:42,670 --> 03:21:45,410
How the fuck do I get to the high ground?

4591
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:50,920
It's not fair!

4592
03:21:53,420 --> 03:21:54,680
I'm gonna figure it out.

4593
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:55,900
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.

4594
03:21:56,960 --> 03:21:58,180
How do I get?

4595
03:21:58,300 --> 03:21:59,080
I jump.

4596
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:01,940
Oh shit, really?

4597
03:22:03,300 --> 03:22:04,820
But which way?

4598
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:06,280
But which way?

4599
03:22:07,420 --> 03:22:10,040
I'm never gonna figure it out, guys.

4600
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:10,540
I'm never gonna figure it out, guys.

4601
03:22:10,540 --> 03:22:11,820
Wait, what the fuck?

4602
03:22:11,960 --> 03:22:13,300
This is a prehistoric rack.

4603
03:22:14,280 --> 03:22:15,660
It's an earth wall?

4604
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:17,060
That's a rat!

4605
03:22:18,820 --> 03:22:19,460
What?

4606
03:22:20,480 --> 03:22:21,440
No way!

4607
03:22:21,560 --> 03:22:22,640
That's a fucking rat!

4608
03:22:24,340 --> 03:22:25,440
Oh, it's daddy!

4609
03:22:26,380 --> 03:22:27,260
That's a wolf!

4610
03:22:29,860 --> 03:22:31,340
It has a rat tail!

4611
03:22:33,560 --> 03:22:36,220
Guys, I think it got confused.

4612
03:22:36,460 --> 03:22:38,160
That's not a wolf.

4613
03:22:40,300 --> 03:22:41,680
A wolf rat.

4614
03:22:44,360 --> 03:22:45,180
Oh shit.

4615
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:47,820
Oh, no.

4616
03:22:47,880 --> 03:22:50,660
I can't believe I cancelled my lock on at the last minute.

4617
03:22:50,900 --> 03:22:51,960
Like, what's wrong with me?

4618
03:22:52,760 --> 03:22:53,800
What's wrong?

4619
03:22:57,700 --> 03:22:59,520
How is that a fucking...

4620
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:02,480
How is that a fucking...

4621
03:23:02,480 --> 03:23:03,220
fucking abomination?

4622
03:23:04,620 --> 03:23:05,460
Alright, nice.

4623
03:23:07,940 --> 03:23:09,320
Oh, a rat.

4624
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:09,680
Oh, a rat.

4625
03:23:09,680 --> 03:23:10,060
Oh, a rat.

4626
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:12,820
Nice.

4627
03:23:14,380 --> 03:23:16,320
Even has a fucking rat tail!

4628
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:20,060
Can you regen my stamina, though?

4629
03:23:20,140 --> 03:23:20,260
Can you regen my stamina, though?

4630
03:23:21,820 --> 03:23:22,600
Okay, nice.

4631
03:23:24,500 --> 03:23:25,400
And then...

4632
03:23:25,400 --> 03:23:26,020
And then...

4633
03:23:26,020 --> 03:23:28,280
Oh, no.

4634
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:30,440
Okay, heal time.

4635
03:23:32,260 --> 03:23:33,380
Oh, dodge.

4636
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:34,320
Oh, dodge.

4637
03:23:35,860 --> 03:23:37,520
Truly an earth wolf.

4638
03:23:37,740 --> 03:23:38,060
Truly an earth wolf.

4639
03:23:38,120 --> 03:23:41,160
An earth wolf is just what rats are called, guys.

4640
03:23:41,200 --> 03:23:41,260
An earth wolf is just what rats are called, guys.

4641
03:23:41,260 --> 03:23:41,640
You don't understand.

4642
03:23:42,040 --> 03:23:42,800
Oh, shit!

4643
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:46,440
Do I get to absorb you?

4644
03:23:47,280 --> 03:23:47,840
Yay!

4645
03:23:50,120 --> 03:23:51,080
Oh, I do!

4646
03:23:52,960 --> 03:23:53,520
Oh, I do!

4647
03:23:53,740 --> 03:23:56,140
Okay, I need to know what happened to you.

4648
03:23:58,220 --> 03:24:01,460
The soldiers in order to kill the hound were much troubled in spirit.

4649
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:04,040
They buried the hound in the field upon the... Oh!

4650
03:24:04,240 --> 03:24:05,440
It's a dead wolf!

4651
03:24:06,240 --> 03:24:06,800
Oh!

4652
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:08,560
He lost all his fur!

4653
03:24:09,560 --> 03:24:10,980
He's like a naked...

4654
03:24:10,980 --> 03:24:12,140
He's a naked wolf!

4655
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:15,820
Absorbed.

4656
03:24:16,680 --> 03:24:18,680
Oh, that makes more sense now.

4657
03:24:19,640 --> 03:24:21,560
He's a naked mole wolf, yeah!

4658
03:24:22,300 --> 03:24:25,120
He's literally a naked mole wolf.

4659
03:24:26,840 --> 03:24:30,260
I was gonna say, I was like, that's just a giant fucking rat.

4660
03:24:31,280 --> 03:24:34,220
But now that I know it's a naked mole wolf.

4661
03:24:36,900 --> 03:24:38,960
Well, can I meditate here?

4662
03:24:39,720 --> 03:24:41,160
Oh, I should open the door too.

4663
03:24:42,580 --> 03:24:43,220
Yeah.

4664
03:24:44,580 --> 03:24:46,060
Door open time!

4665
03:24:47,400 --> 03:24:49,940
I finally explored this place.

4666
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:50,460
Hey guys!

4667
03:24:57,960 --> 03:24:58,900
They're like, what the fuck?

4668
03:24:58,980 --> 03:25:01,780
You're not supposed to be able to open the door.

4669
03:25:04,160 --> 03:25:05,700
It's like, what the fuck happened?

4670
03:25:08,120 --> 03:25:09,020
Okay, nice.

4671
03:25:10,120 --> 03:25:10,620
Easy!

4672
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:16,040
After killing that rat, you think I'm scared of you?

4673
03:25:16,840 --> 03:25:19,240
You brought a bow to a sad fight.

4674
03:25:21,120 --> 03:25:21,600
Absorbed.

4675
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:23,580
Wait a minute.

4676
03:25:23,940 --> 03:25:25,700
You're not the pizza order.

4677
03:25:30,100 --> 03:25:30,580
Nice.

4678
03:25:31,060 --> 03:25:32,560
I got the rat archer.

4679
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:36,080
Now where do we go?

4680
03:25:36,180 --> 03:25:39,540
Oh, this guy like, just watched as his friends all die.

4681
03:25:42,860 --> 03:25:44,020
There's a horseman?

4682
03:25:47,700 --> 03:25:50,140
How many fucking animals do I have to kill?

4683
03:25:52,180 --> 03:25:53,160
Wait, there's stuff here.

4684
03:25:54,300 --> 03:25:56,260
There's more materials I'm never gonna use.

4685
03:26:00,620 --> 03:26:01,100
Alright.

4686
03:26:03,480 --> 03:26:05,680
Yeah, I didn't- I got lost a lot.

4687
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:12,120
I don't know if you guys noticed, but yeah, I got lost a lot.

4688
03:26:12,220 --> 03:26:16,320
If you think I found somebody, you're like, Doki found this person?

4689
03:26:16,780 --> 03:26:18,580
Most likely, I did not.

4690
03:26:22,780 --> 03:26:26,860
The rate of me figuring- knowing where I am is quite high.

4691
03:26:27,440 --> 03:26:28,600
No, quite low.

4692
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:31,140
I couldn't even get that right.

4693
03:26:34,320 --> 03:26:36,020
Where the fuck's the well?

4694
03:26:36,320 --> 03:26:38,360
It's just all sand!

4695
03:26:42,440 --> 03:26:43,540
Is it this way?

4696
03:26:45,320 --> 03:26:46,480
Oh, is that the well?

4697
03:26:47,800 --> 03:26:49,080
That has to be the well.

4698
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:51,780
No, that- I was here.

4699
03:26:52,980 --> 03:26:53,860
I was here.

4700
03:26:54,920 --> 03:26:55,820
Where am I?

4701
03:26:59,700 --> 03:27:01,640
Where the fuck am I?

4702
03:27:01,680 --> 03:27:02,320
I was here!

4703
03:27:02,460 --> 03:27:03,560
The chest is open!

4704
03:27:09,140 --> 03:27:10,840
Oh, I ran near his back here?

4705
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:13,780
Is it that?

4706
03:27:17,370 --> 03:27:19,070
Oh, I didn't gather lily pads.

4707
03:27:19,370 --> 03:27:19,610
Alright.

4708
03:27:21,770 --> 03:27:22,910
Am I heading west?

4709
03:27:23,950 --> 03:27:26,290
Is this- is this west?

4710
03:27:30,310 --> 03:27:33,510
One day, I'll find my journey to the west.

4711
03:27:34,090 --> 03:27:40,910
One day, the journey- the journey to the west will be over.

4712
03:27:47,500 --> 03:27:48,620
Is it here?

4713
03:27:50,240 --> 03:27:51,900
Journey to the well.

4714
03:27:55,420 --> 03:27:56,280
Getting warmer?

4715
03:28:02,900 --> 03:28:04,180
What's that sound?

4716
03:28:05,440 --> 03:28:06,900
Does it jump up?

4717
03:28:10,540 --> 03:28:13,720
Where the fuck is this goddamn well?

4718
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:21,340
How the fuck do I get there?

4719
03:28:24,520 --> 03:28:26,040
I can't enter again!

4720
03:28:28,740 --> 03:28:29,280
Wait!

4721
03:28:29,720 --> 03:28:32,340
Oh my god, that's yellow- No, I can't!

4722
03:28:34,480 --> 03:28:35,560
The hole?!

4723
03:28:36,200 --> 03:28:40,800
When there's a hole, there's a goal, but where the fuck is this hole you speak of?

4724
03:28:44,060 --> 03:28:45,340
Look behind me?

4725
03:28:45,720 --> 03:28:46,960
Oh my god.

4726
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:50,960
That's a hole.

4727
03:28:52,980 --> 03:28:54,620
But I can't get in.

4728
03:28:55,660 --> 03:28:59,080
But- I can't even get in the hole!

4729
03:29:04,830 --> 03:29:09,210
It doesn't even let- Where's the child?

4730
03:29:12,050 --> 03:29:15,610
I didn't find the ghost kid?!

4731
03:29:15,930 --> 03:29:19,730
Did not find the coughing baby?!

4732
03:29:19,730 --> 03:29:19,970
Yeah.

4733
03:29:22,390 --> 03:29:24,550
Oh my god.

4734
03:29:27,570 --> 03:29:34,590
Go to Wind Rest, where the three assassin rats attack you, then come- Where the fuck is that?!

4735
03:29:34,590 --> 03:29:35,170
Where-

4736
03:29:38,930 --> 03:29:39,690
Okay.

4737
03:29:39,690 --> 03:29:40,450
Alright.

4738
03:29:40,770 --> 03:29:43,190
Where am- Where am I?

4739
03:29:43,270 --> 03:29:44,350
Where's the incense?

4740
03:29:45,710 --> 03:29:47,430
Oh my god.

4741
03:29:47,610 --> 03:29:48,890
I can't.

4742
03:29:48,930 --> 03:29:50,250
I'm so lost.

4743
03:29:50,510 --> 03:29:53,030
Bro, I can't deal with you, bro.

4744
03:29:53,330 --> 03:29:56,890
I'm trying to figure out how to get out of here.

4745
03:29:58,030 --> 03:29:59,610
Oh my god.

4746
03:29:59,650 --> 03:29:59,970
Alright.

4747
03:30:01,950 --> 03:30:03,070
We missed.

4748
03:30:03,290 --> 03:30:08,170
Alright, we gotta find the- We gotta find another fast travel.

4749
03:30:09,690 --> 03:30:11,390
No, I'm not gonna use the item in my bag.

4750
03:30:11,490 --> 03:30:13,090
What if I need it later, guys?

4751
03:30:13,990 --> 03:30:20,310
Guys, what if I need it la- Guys, you don't understand.

4752
03:30:21,310 --> 03:30:23,770
What if I need it later?

4753
03:30:29,420 --> 03:30:31,160
It's infinite uses.

4754
03:30:32,660 --> 03:30:33,260
Guys,

4755
03:30:36,480 --> 03:30:36,660
no.

4756
03:30:36,800 --> 03:30:38,720
What if I- Guys, you don't understand.

4757
03:30:39,160 --> 03:30:40,340
It might be important later.

4758
03:30:41,900 --> 03:30:44,220
I'm saving it for Wukong 2.

4759
03:30:46,120 --> 03:30:47,140
Okay, travel.

4760
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:48,680
We're not to go again?

4761
03:30:51,480 --> 03:30:52,860
Is it this amulet?

4762
03:30:54,280 --> 03:30:55,240
Is this?

4763
03:30:59,780 --> 03:31:00,660
Is this one?

4764
03:31:00,840 --> 03:31:01,080
Alright.

4765
03:31:03,220 --> 03:31:06,020
The natural gamer response.

4766
03:31:06,320 --> 03:31:11,800
What if, like, Wukong 2 takes your inventory from last game, guys?

4767
03:31:17,240 --> 03:31:28,780
What if your progress travels What if your progress, you know, What if your progress, you know, What if your progress, you know, passes over?

4768
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:30,560
What if your progress, you know, passes over?

4769
03:31:31,620 --> 03:31:32,340
Wrong!

4770
03:31:33,100 --> 03:31:34,340
Okay, wrong.

4771
03:31:35,520 --> 03:31:37,000
A little horse guy.

4772
03:31:37,400 --> 03:31:40,240
I'm- Whoa, whoa!

4773
03:31:40,520 --> 03:31:43,080
I have enough stamina in the world!

4774
03:31:43,920 --> 03:31:43,940
I have enough stamina in the world!

4775
03:31:44,240 --> 03:31:45,920
Alright, back I go.

4776
03:31:49,280 --> 03:31:50,260
Let's see.

4777
03:31:50,480 --> 03:31:50,640
Let's see.

4778
03:31:52,500 --> 03:32:00,620
I mean, I'm pretty sure- I'm actually looking forward to see what this game company's gonna make in the future for gaming.

4779
03:32:01,360 --> 03:32:06,360
I mean, they've been- This as their first game is actually crazy.

4780
03:32:06,760 --> 03:32:09,360
Like, as their first fucking game.

4781
03:32:10,520 --> 03:32:11,480
Okay, child.

4782
03:32:11,640 --> 03:32:13,200
Where the fuck are you?

4783
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:16,640
Where are the children?

4784
03:32:17,980 --> 03:32:18,620
Left?

4785
03:32:23,940 --> 03:32:24,580
Oh.

4786
03:32:24,980 --> 03:32:26,520
Oh, no, that's Gat Ingredients.

4787
03:32:27,780 --> 03:32:28,260
Oh!

4788
03:32:29,280 --> 03:32:29,920
Coughing baby!

4789
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:32,160
Little monkey, I'm here.

4790
03:32:32,760 --> 03:32:33,360
I'm here.

4791
03:32:38,460 --> 03:32:38,940
Ratta?

4792
03:32:46,320 --> 03:32:49,120
Also, why am I holding a child's toy in my inventory?

4793
03:32:49,500 --> 03:32:50,520
Like, I'm a little-

4794
03:32:53,660 --> 03:32:54,760
Where's my dad?

4795
03:32:58,400 --> 03:32:58,880
Wait,

4796
03:33:04,330 --> 03:33:04,530
what?

4797
03:33:05,330 --> 03:33:10,130
You're - Wait, your dad might be a bad person!

4798
03:33:12,810 --> 03:33:13,930
What do you mean?

4799
03:33:14,410 --> 03:33:18,450
What do you mean you- Did your dad feed you to the other monsters?

4800
03:33:19,330 --> 03:33:20,050
That's fucked.

4801
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:21,910
Alright.

4802
03:33:22,810 --> 03:33:24,910
Don't worry, I'm not gonna use any of my magic.

4803
03:33:26,110 --> 03:33:26,590
Boop!

4804
03:33:26,590 --> 03:33:27,610
Because you're pretty weak.

4805
03:33:28,270 --> 03:33:28,750
Boop!

4806
03:33:28,810 --> 03:33:29,270
Oh, shit.

4807
03:33:30,430 --> 03:33:30,910
Alright.

4808
03:33:32,510 --> 03:33:34,110
We found the other baby.

4809
03:33:35,810 --> 03:33:38,010
We found the other coughing baby.

4810
03:33:38,350 --> 03:33:41,450
Now, can I go back to the well?

4811
03:33:42,490 --> 03:33:43,370
Okay.

4812
03:33:44,850 --> 03:33:45,730
Okay.

4813
03:33:45,790 --> 03:33:48,030
Now it's well time.

4814
03:33:48,610 --> 03:33:49,490
Alright.

4815
03:33:50,330 --> 03:33:52,830
It's so fucking well time.

4816
03:33:55,870 --> 03:33:58,150
Oh my god.

4817
03:33:59,910 --> 03:34:02,930
Holy shit, it's well time.

4818
03:34:05,230 --> 03:34:06,370
Oh, thank god.

4819
03:34:06,450 --> 03:34:17,030
I think if I didn't- If I was not a streamer, and I had to do this all by myself, I think we would- This game will not be finished.

4820
03:34:19,070 --> 03:34:25,690
This will not be finished, but like, I would definitely not have done the side quest because I would not have known what to do.

4821
03:34:25,950 --> 03:34:31,090
I would not have known what to do for the side quest.

4822
03:34:33,910 --> 03:34:35,050
I got that.

4823
03:34:35,230 --> 03:34:38,770
This would definitely take me a lot longer to finish, that's for sure.

4824
03:34:38,930 --> 03:34:41,030
If I didn't have chat telling me where to go.

4825
03:34:41,370 --> 03:34:42,830
I'm always lost.

4826
03:34:44,730 --> 03:34:45,290
Nice.

4827
03:34:45,570 --> 03:34:45,910
Goodbye.

4828
03:34:47,250 --> 03:34:47,970
Here we go.

4829
03:34:49,510 --> 03:34:51,490
Thanks for the will, sucker.

4830
03:34:52,870 --> 03:34:53,430
Okay.

4831
03:34:56,670 --> 03:34:58,550
Time to go to the well.

4832
03:34:58,890 --> 03:34:59,250
Oh.

4833
03:35:00,870 --> 03:35:01,430
Child?

4834
03:35:04,670 --> 03:35:06,050
Come out, child.

4835
03:35:13,430 --> 03:35:14,230
Ghost?

4836
03:35:30,750 --> 03:35:38,270
Are you guys summoning a fucking monster?

4837
03:35:42,610 --> 03:35:43,490
I don't know.

4838
03:35:45,110 --> 03:35:46,010
I don't know.

4839
03:35:46,130 --> 03:35:51,310
My grandpa told me not to jump into strange wells with ghosts who told me there's a friend living down there.

4840
03:35:51,530 --> 03:35:52,930
Oh, it could be a Ninja Turtle though.

4841
03:35:56,350 --> 03:35:57,190
Oh my god.

4842
03:35:57,230 --> 03:35:58,910
Am I gonna meet the Ninja Turtles?

4843
03:36:30,410 --> 03:36:31,730
Guys, I don't think...

4844
03:36:33,030 --> 03:36:34,950
Guys, I don't think that's a Ninja Turtle.

4845
03:36:35,650 --> 03:36:37,910
Guys, I don't think that's a Ninja Turtle, guys.

4846
03:36:38,430 --> 03:36:40,790
Guys, I don't... Guys, I think the kid baited me.

4847
03:36:40,910 --> 03:36:42,610
Guys, I think the kid baited me!

4848
03:36:47,150 --> 03:36:47,870
Holy shit!

4849
03:36:49,030 --> 03:36:52,230
A child baited... I knew it!

4850
03:36:52,330 --> 03:36:55,590
Instead of the bed, the child baited me into the well!

4851
03:36:57,590 --> 03:36:59,010
That's so fun.

4852
03:37:00,140 --> 03:37:01,430
Oh my god.

4853
03:37:02,040 --> 03:37:04,030
The child baited me.

4854
03:37:04,970 --> 03:37:06,190
Oh shit.

4855
03:37:06,470 --> 03:37:06,850
Oh!

4856
03:37:09,030 --> 03:37:10,330
These monkeys!

4857
03:37:13,390 --> 03:37:14,210
Oh!

4858
03:37:14,870 --> 03:37:15,690
What?!

4859
03:37:16,430 --> 03:37:18,270
The tiger is...

4860
03:37:18,430 --> 03:37:20,130
destroying my frames!

4861
03:37:20,450 --> 03:37:22,710
Holy shit!

4862
03:37:24,280 --> 03:37:29,130
The tiger is so mad that my frames just died!

4863
03:37:30,100 --> 03:37:33,030
That is a very mad tiger.

4864
03:37:33,470 --> 03:37:36,190
Oh my god.

4865
03:37:36,510 --> 03:37:39,570
The tiger is so mad.

4866
03:37:40,050 --> 03:37:43,950
I couldn't see where I was.

4867
03:37:44,290 --> 03:37:45,810
Where am I?

4868
03:37:50,570 --> 03:37:51,030
Oh my god.

4869
03:37:51,750 --> 03:37:52,970
Oh my god.

4870
03:37:52,970 --> 03:37:53,350
Oh my god.

4871
03:37:53,350 --> 03:37:54,730
Monkey children, go!

4872
03:37:55,290 --> 03:37:57,070
Go, monkey children, go!

4873
03:38:00,270 --> 03:38:00,650
Oh!

4874
03:38:00,770 --> 03:38:02,070
Jesus Christ!

4875
03:38:02,330 --> 03:38:03,710
Oh, he's so mad!

4876
03:38:04,150 --> 03:38:04,910
Oh!

4877
03:38:05,130 --> 03:38:07,610
What is this moose?!

4878
03:38:10,170 --> 03:38:11,690
Holy shit!

4879
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:19,600
Oh, you need the lower effects?

4880
03:38:19,900 --> 03:38:21,020
Oh my god!

4881
03:38:21,020 --> 03:38:24,060
There's too many particles!

4882
03:38:25,060 --> 03:38:28,140
There's so many particles!

4883
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:31,540
Oh my god.

4884
03:38:31,860 --> 03:38:35,080
Why did you bring me into the well, child?

4885
03:38:36,120 --> 03:38:38,260
Oh, child, please!

4886
03:38:39,360 --> 03:38:40,700
Oh my god.

4887
03:38:41,900 --> 03:38:44,140
This is so scary.

4888
03:38:46,760 --> 03:38:47,680
Hair!

4889
03:38:48,400 --> 03:38:49,060
Oh!

4890
03:38:49,200 --> 03:38:49,780
No!

4891
03:38:49,960 --> 03:38:50,480
No hair.

4892
03:38:50,600 --> 03:38:51,380
Oh, yes, there is hair!

4893
03:38:51,380 --> 03:38:53,040
What is going on?

4894
03:38:53,200 --> 03:38:53,520
What?

4895
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:54,180
There is so many!

4896
03:38:59,280 --> 03:39:01,120
Oh my god!

4897
03:39:03,840 --> 03:39:05,880
Oh my god.

4898
03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:06,680
What?

4899
03:39:07,260 --> 03:39:09,720
What is this boss fight?

4900
03:39:11,200 --> 03:39:12,760
Nobody is back!

4901
03:39:20,080 --> 03:39:22,540
Oh my god, he's talking out!

4902
03:39:22,620 --> 03:39:24,600
He walked out!

4903
03:39:26,980 --> 03:39:31,540
Why didn't I listen to the giant?!

4904
03:39:34,660 --> 03:39:35,980
Oh my god.

4905
03:39:37,620 --> 03:39:39,200
I'm lowering the effects.

4906
03:39:39,380 --> 03:39:40,060
I can't.

4907
03:39:45,220 --> 03:39:46,740
I can't.

4908
03:39:46,760 --> 03:39:49,440
I need to lower the effects in this one arena.

4909
03:39:49,720 --> 03:39:51,240
It's actually crazy.

4910
03:39:51,620 --> 03:39:54,200
I cannot see anything.

4911
03:39:54,200 --> 03:39:56,420
The frames are so...

4912
03:39:57,880 --> 03:40:02,320
I hate it when a child lures me into a well.

4913
03:40:02,600 --> 03:40:04,240
Oh my god.

4914
03:40:04,400 --> 03:40:06,160
What do I have to lower?

4915
03:40:07,360 --> 03:40:09,280
What is it?

4916
03:40:10,060 --> 03:40:11,960
There's so many things!

4917
03:40:16,080 --> 03:40:18,180
Is it the effects?

4918
03:40:18,360 --> 03:40:19,680
Is it the post-effect quality?

4919
03:40:20,120 --> 03:40:21,340
Or the visual?

4920
03:40:21,360 --> 03:40:22,940
Is it the visual effects?

4921
03:40:24,200 --> 03:40:25,900
Oh my god.

4922
03:40:26,020 --> 03:40:26,480
Okay.

4923
03:40:28,060 --> 03:40:28,820
Low.

4924
03:40:30,620 --> 03:40:31,380
Alright.

4925
03:40:31,380 --> 03:40:32,140
Yes.

4926
03:40:33,780 --> 03:40:36,000
Okay, this might help me.

4927
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:38,160
This might actually help.

4928
03:40:41,380 --> 03:40:42,880
It's just for the tiger.

4929
03:40:43,060 --> 03:40:44,540
Oh my god, look at his hair!

4930
03:40:44,760 --> 03:40:47,280
Look at his hair!

4931
03:40:50,920 --> 03:40:51,960
Holy shit.

4932
03:40:53,160 --> 03:40:54,040
Where am I?

4933
03:40:59,740 --> 03:41:01,240
Oh my god.

4934
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:03,120
Okay.

4935
03:41:04,360 --> 03:41:06,940
Do you think the baby can smash him there?

4936
03:41:11,380 --> 03:41:12,660
Baby still smash!

4937
03:41:13,640 --> 03:41:17,020
Okay, I need to like go drink some hydrate real fast.

4938
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:19,920
Oh no.

4939
03:41:24,300 --> 03:41:26,460
It's definitely a lot better though.

4940
03:41:26,540 --> 03:41:27,240
Not gonna lie.

4941
03:41:27,540 --> 03:41:29,680
It feels so much better.

4942
03:41:29,880 --> 03:41:30,720
Oh my.

4943
03:41:30,780 --> 03:41:32,040
I can actually see.

4944
03:41:32,960 --> 03:41:34,120
Is that crazy?

4945
03:41:37,260 --> 03:41:37,860
Oh.

4946
03:41:37,860 --> 03:41:39,740
Oh shit!

4947
03:41:42,640 --> 03:41:44,420
Oh my god!

4948
03:41:44,460 --> 03:41:45,600
Please don't grab me!

4949
03:41:45,620 --> 03:41:47,020
I'm just a little monkey!

4950
03:41:47,520 --> 03:41:48,360
Oh!

4951
03:41:52,290 --> 03:41:54,010
Oh my god!

4952
03:42:01,550 --> 03:42:04,010
He's so fucking strong!

4953
03:42:05,870 --> 03:42:07,550
I couldn't heal!

4954
03:42:12,410 --> 03:42:13,690
Oh my god.

4955
03:42:16,470 --> 03:42:17,110
Wolf.

4956
03:42:17,490 --> 03:42:19,550
Wolf guy is my only hope.

4957
03:42:19,750 --> 03:42:20,330
I'll hit...

4958
03:42:20,330 --> 03:42:20,490
No!

4959
03:42:22,170 --> 03:42:24,970
Like I said that and then I missed.

4960
03:42:25,310 --> 03:42:26,770
And I missed again.

4961
03:42:27,250 --> 03:42:28,510
And I'll keep missing.

4962
03:42:28,610 --> 03:42:29,750
That's fucking right.

4963
03:42:31,610 --> 03:42:32,250
Alright.

4964
03:42:35,130 --> 03:42:36,430
No, I didn't mean...

4965
03:42:36,430 --> 03:42:38,110
Oh, I did not mean to...

4966
03:42:38,110 --> 03:42:38,530
No!

4967
03:42:38,910 --> 03:42:39,550
No!

4968
03:42:40,510 --> 03:42:41,150
No!

4969
03:42:41,150 --> 03:42:41,430
No!

4970
03:42:44,030 --> 03:42:45,870
No, you fucking...

4971
03:42:48,850 --> 03:42:49,590
Come on.

4972
03:42:49,590 --> 03:42:49,970
Come on.

4973
03:42:49,970 --> 03:42:50,390
Come on.

4974
03:42:50,390 --> 03:42:50,830
Come on.

4975
03:42:50,830 --> 03:42:51,450
Get the hairs.

4976
03:42:51,590 --> 03:42:52,690
Get the hairs in.

4977
03:42:53,070 --> 03:42:54,510
Get the hairs in!

4978
03:42:57,490 --> 03:42:59,030
Oh my god.

4979
03:43:02,170 --> 03:43:02,790
Come on.

4980
03:43:02,830 --> 03:43:03,790
You gotta get over here, right?

4981
03:43:03,990 --> 03:43:04,230
No!

4982
03:43:06,850 --> 03:43:07,370
Jesus!

4983
03:43:08,530 --> 03:43:09,050
Oh!

4984
03:43:10,350 --> 03:43:11,730
This is so much!

4985
03:43:18,970 --> 03:43:19,870
I'm so sorry!

4986
03:43:20,590 --> 03:43:21,070
Alright.

4987
03:43:22,030 --> 03:43:23,490
JK, I was never...

4988
03:43:23,490 --> 03:43:24,050
Oh shit!

4989
03:43:24,610 --> 03:43:25,410
I'm sorry!

4990
03:43:26,590 --> 03:43:27,670
I'm so sorry!

4991
03:43:28,730 --> 03:43:29,210
I'm...

4992
03:43:29,990 --> 03:43:31,470
I'm so sorry!

4993
03:43:33,170 --> 03:43:33,650
Okay.

4994
03:43:38,910 --> 03:43:39,390
Oh!

4995
03:43:39,410 --> 03:43:40,030
Fuck it!

4996
03:43:40,110 --> 03:43:41,470
Can you remember that he does that?

4997
03:43:43,370 --> 03:43:43,850
Okay.

4998
03:43:43,890 --> 03:43:44,170
It's okay.

4999
03:43:44,250 --> 03:43:44,830
He's too busy for that.

5000
03:43:44,850 --> 03:43:45,010
He's too busy for that.

5001
03:43:45,010 --> 03:43:45,170
I'm relaxing now.

5002
03:43:46,570 --> 03:43:47,190
Oh!

5003
03:43:47,550 --> 03:43:48,170
Okay.

5004
03:43:50,710 --> 03:43:51,330
Nice!

5005
03:43:52,410 --> 03:43:53,030
PUSH!

5006
03:43:53,050 --> 03:43:53,270
OH!

5007
03:43:53,450 --> 03:43:53,870
FUCK!

5008
03:43:54,070 --> 03:43:54,750
Why did I POK!

5009
03:43:56,730 --> 03:43:58,710
I should have known poking was a mistake!

5010
03:44:00,390 --> 03:44:01,010
No!

5011
03:44:02,030 --> 03:44:02,650
No!

5012
03:44:02,730 --> 03:44:03,210
Okay.

5013
03:44:04,410 --> 03:44:05,030
No!

5014
03:44:05,370 --> 03:44:05,970
I

5015
03:44:16,650 --> 03:44:17,970
couldn't dodge it in time!

5016
03:44:21,610 --> 03:44:24,690
I couldn't dodge it in time!

5017
03:44:25,030 --> 03:44:25,510
Okay.

5018
03:44:26,430 --> 03:44:27,990
Jesus Christ!

5019
03:44:28,410 --> 03:44:29,990
Stupid tiger!

5020
03:44:30,370 --> 03:44:31,750
I thought it was over!

5021
03:44:32,310 --> 03:44:34,670
I thought it was over!

5022
03:44:34,990 --> 03:44:37,130
I didn't think I had the team.

5023
03:44:37,290 --> 03:44:42,250
I didn't realize totally the tiger had a fucking brother!

5024
03:44:44,270 --> 03:44:45,810
Oh my god.

5025
03:44:52,050 --> 03:44:52,850
Okay.

5026
03:44:52,850 --> 03:44:53,910
Head bash!

5027
03:44:55,510 --> 03:44:56,310
Here!

5028
03:44:58,310 --> 03:44:59,230
Okay.

5029
03:44:59,230 --> 03:45:00,150
Okay.

5030
03:45:00,250 --> 03:45:01,250
Not okay.

5031
03:45:01,630 --> 03:45:05,950
I do not feel okay right now.

5032
03:45:09,390 --> 03:45:10,770
His abilities.

5033
03:45:16,630 --> 03:45:20,570
Tony and the tiger and his brother Frank the Tank.

5034
03:45:25,510 --> 03:45:26,970
Oh my god.

5035
03:45:27,090 --> 03:45:28,650
Jesus Christ.

5036
03:45:30,430 --> 03:45:32,930
He's so fucking strong.

5037
03:45:33,590 --> 03:45:34,390
No.

5038
03:45:36,430 --> 03:45:38,910
Wait, did I even hit him?

5039
03:45:39,090 --> 03:45:40,470
No, I don't think I did.

5040
03:45:42,670 --> 03:45:43,630
Okay.

5041
03:45:48,310 --> 03:45:48,790
Smash!

5042
03:45:51,250 --> 03:45:52,210
Here.

5043
03:45:54,250 --> 03:45:55,430
Oh god.

5044
03:45:57,710 --> 03:45:58,350
Smash!

5045
03:45:58,350 --> 03:45:59,890
Smash to the sequel!

5046
03:46:02,590 --> 03:46:03,230
Okay.

5047
03:46:05,050 --> 03:46:05,690
Okay.

5048
03:46:07,430 --> 03:46:08,910
Oh my god.

5049
03:46:08,930 --> 03:46:10,010
Are you fucking kidding me?

5050
03:46:10,130 --> 03:46:11,870
I like how the monkey's healing too.

5051
03:46:15,190 --> 03:46:16,470
Oh shit.

5052
03:46:16,630 --> 03:46:19,090
Where did my monkey's go?

5053
03:46:19,090 --> 03:46:19,530
Go!

5054
03:46:20,650 --> 03:46:21,530
Monkey!

5055
03:46:23,770 --> 03:46:24,210
Okay.

5056
03:46:26,850 --> 03:46:28,070
Oh, please!

5057
03:46:28,550 --> 03:46:31,010
Have mercy on me!

5058
03:46:31,910 --> 03:46:33,310
I didn't know!

5059
03:46:34,690 --> 03:46:35,950
No, I missed!

5060
03:46:44,080 --> 03:46:46,120
I'm gonna make it last.

5061
03:46:46,900 --> 03:46:47,340
Why?

5062
03:46:47,500 --> 03:46:51,640
Why did I follow the child into the well?

5063
03:46:52,780 --> 03:46:53,660
What?

5064
03:46:54,100 --> 03:46:56,740
I thought it was a good idea!

5065
03:46:58,340 --> 03:47:00,100
Oh no!

5066
03:47:00,420 --> 03:47:02,220
It's hog time!

5067
03:47:03,400 --> 03:47:04,280
Goodbye!

5068
03:47:05,800 --> 03:47:09,200
Guys, never follow a child into a well.

5069
03:47:09,380 --> 03:47:11,980
Never, never follow...

5070
03:47:11,980 --> 03:47:15,660
I thought he was gonna give me treasures!

5071
03:47:18,320 --> 03:47:19,120
They were right.

5072
03:47:19,400 --> 03:47:20,600
Children are evil.

5073
03:47:20,600 --> 03:47:22,540
Children are evil.

5074
03:47:27,480 --> 03:47:31,280
Okay, this time... oh wait, there's an incense.

5075
03:47:32,500 --> 03:47:34,060
Is there?

5076
03:47:34,260 --> 03:47:36,940
I never noticed this.

5077
03:47:40,300 --> 03:47:42,680
I never noticed it.

5078
03:47:43,140 --> 03:47:43,920
Alright.

5079
03:47:45,380 --> 03:47:47,140
Kids are so cruel.

5080
03:47:47,440 --> 03:47:48,360
They are.

5081
03:47:51,500 --> 03:47:52,020
Okay.

5082
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:54,440
Well, where am I?

5083
03:47:56,200 --> 03:47:59,420
Oh my god, I was like, I couldn't even see where I am.

5084
03:48:00,280 --> 03:48:00,800
Pew!

5085
03:48:03,480 --> 03:48:04,000
Alright.

5086
03:48:04,500 --> 03:48:05,020
Bash!

5087
03:48:05,880 --> 03:48:07,160
I'm gonna do it out of order.

5088
03:48:08,500 --> 03:48:10,100
And then... hair.

5089
03:48:10,860 --> 03:48:11,880
Now I should have time.

5090
03:48:12,740 --> 03:48:13,740
Okay, here we go.

5091
03:48:15,220 --> 03:48:15,740
Oh!

5092
03:48:16,740 --> 03:48:17,260
Oh!

5093
03:48:17,260 --> 03:48:17,580
Oh!

5094
03:48:18,080 --> 03:48:19,360
No, I timed incorrectly!

5095
03:48:22,700 --> 03:48:25,400
I sometimes don't know which is that move!

5096
03:48:28,000 --> 03:48:30,480
It's so fucking infuriating!

5097
03:48:32,800 --> 03:48:34,440
Oh my god!

5098
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:38,960
It's so hard to predict!

5099
03:48:43,240 --> 03:48:43,920
Okay.

5100
03:48:44,980 --> 03:48:47,940
Oh my god, that's not it!

5101
03:48:48,620 --> 03:48:50,300
That's not it, guys!

5102
03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:55,360
Oh my god!

5103
03:48:55,360 --> 03:48:55,440
I

5104
03:49:01,420 --> 03:49:03,920
can't believe I got baited by you guys!

5105
03:49:05,240 --> 03:49:06,600
Side quest!

5106
03:49:09,520 --> 03:49:12,080
That's the high... the child... the coughing baby.

5107
03:49:12,320 --> 03:49:15,160
This is literally... that's the hydrogen bomb right there.

5108
03:49:15,340 --> 03:49:17,360
He is the hydrogen bomb.

5109
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:23,900
He was the hydrogen bomb this whole time.

5110
03:49:25,280 --> 03:49:26,080
Alright.

5111
03:49:26,600 --> 03:49:27,400
Boom!

5112
03:49:27,560 --> 03:49:28,360
Boom!

5113
03:49:28,420 --> 03:49:28,900
Boom!

5114
03:49:29,100 --> 03:49:30,060
Oh, okay.

5115
03:49:31,900 --> 03:49:32,700
Baby!

5116
03:49:34,840 --> 03:49:35,640
Okay.

5117
03:49:36,060 --> 03:49:36,860
Alright.

5118
03:49:37,160 --> 03:49:37,960
Hair!

5119
03:49:38,940 --> 03:49:39,740
Alright.

5120
03:49:40,140 --> 03:49:41,260
Hair time.

5121
03:49:41,520 --> 03:49:42,560
Fucking hell!

5122
03:49:43,100 --> 03:49:44,820
Oh, okay.

5123
03:49:50,840 --> 03:49:52,560
Alright, we're just gonna...

5124
03:49:56,150 --> 03:49:56,830
Okay.

5125
03:49:56,890 --> 03:49:57,450
Okay.

5126
03:49:58,430 --> 03:49:58,910
Alright.

5127
03:49:59,250 --> 03:50:00,810
I dodged it once.

5128
03:50:01,850 --> 03:50:03,290
That's all I could do!

5129
03:50:07,190 --> 03:50:11,410
Oh, you can run too?!

5130
03:50:25,740 --> 03:50:27,880
I closed count.

5131
03:50:27,940 --> 03:50:29,240
Oh, it's so bad.

5132
03:50:30,520 --> 03:50:33,060
Oh, I'm still trying to figure out...

5133
03:50:33,060 --> 03:50:35,320
It's like his move sense is so weird.

5134
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:36,720
I'm still trying to figure out...

5135
03:50:43,220 --> 03:50:53,100
I think the hardest part is that his movesets are so fucking weird that I can barely register what they are sometimes.

5136
03:50:59,560 --> 03:51:01,560
Some people say I should just save.

5137
03:51:08,670 --> 03:51:09,330
Jesus!

5138
03:51:12,350 --> 03:51:13,130
Okay.

5139
03:51:26,360 --> 03:51:28,080
God damn it!

5140
03:51:28,380 --> 03:51:29,800
Oh my god.

5141
03:51:30,240 --> 03:51:31,420
No, please!

5142
03:51:36,150 --> 03:51:38,630
No, no, no, no, no, no!

5143
03:51:44,010 --> 03:51:44,400
Okay.

5144
03:51:45,280 --> 03:51:46,640
Please, hydrate.

5145
03:51:47,020 --> 03:51:47,800
Hydrate!

5146
03:51:51,120 --> 03:51:51,600
No!

5147
03:51:51,720 --> 03:51:52,940
He slammed me!

5148
03:51:55,180 --> 03:51:55,860
Dodge.

5149
03:51:57,900 --> 03:51:58,240
Drink.

5150
03:51:58,860 --> 03:51:59,420
Hydrate time!

5151
03:52:00,940 --> 03:52:01,280
Dodge!

5152
03:52:02,820 --> 03:52:03,500
I'm

5153
03:52:10,820 --> 03:52:11,680
gonna poke you in the ass!

5154
03:52:12,360 --> 03:52:12,880
Hydrate.

5155
03:52:13,500 --> 03:52:14,380
I'm sorry.

5156
03:52:14,620 --> 03:52:15,400
I know you didn't like that.

5157
03:52:17,220 --> 03:52:18,120
Oh, okay.

5158
03:52:21,160 --> 03:52:21,840
Butt time!

5159
03:52:27,120 --> 03:52:27,800
Okay.

5160
03:52:27,980 --> 03:52:28,580
No!

5161
03:52:29,980 --> 03:52:30,660
No!

5162
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:32,480
The giant butt slam!

5163
03:52:34,480 --> 03:52:35,420
Oh...

5164
03:52:39,210 --> 03:52:39,680
Alright.

5165
03:52:39,900 --> 03:52:41,160
No, no!

5166
03:52:41,360 --> 03:52:42,300
No!

5167
03:52:45,260 --> 03:52:46,360
I don't...

5168
03:52:46,360 --> 03:52:47,160
Guys, I don't know.

5169
03:52:47,220 --> 03:52:48,180
I don't know that.

5170
03:52:50,920 --> 03:52:51,900
Oh, god!

5171
03:52:52,240 --> 03:52:53,140
We

5172
03:53:10,540 --> 03:53:12,660
got the Tire!

5173
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:15,840
Fucking hate children.

5174
03:53:18,720 --> 03:53:20,500
I need a rest.

5175
03:53:20,840 --> 03:53:22,020
I need a rest.

5176
03:53:23,380 --> 03:53:25,140
Oh, holy shit.

5177
03:53:27,380 --> 03:53:28,180
Okay.

5178
03:53:28,180 --> 03:53:28,980
Okay.

5179
03:53:29,140 --> 03:53:30,400
Who's stronger?

5180
03:53:32,020 --> 03:53:33,160
Who's stronger?

5181
03:53:33,380 --> 03:53:34,960
The baby or the tiger?

5182
03:53:35,720 --> 03:53:41,720
Takes the form of void or pteromite, shocks surrounding foes and deals aria damage to the front.

5183
03:53:41,940 --> 03:53:44,840
But massively reduces maximum health.

5184
03:53:44,840 --> 03:53:47,140
I feel like it's still not as good.

5185
03:53:48,380 --> 03:53:49,720
I feel like...

5186
03:53:49,720 --> 03:53:51,500
Oh, but lowers health?

5187
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:52,140
Yeah, no.

5188
03:53:52,360 --> 03:53:52,760
Alright.

5189
03:53:52,960 --> 03:53:53,920
Then we don't do it.

5190
03:53:55,260 --> 03:53:56,140
Baby better.

5191
03:53:56,300 --> 03:53:58,200
The ugly tiger.

5192
03:54:02,180 --> 03:54:05,140
Okay, the baby is still better.

5193
03:54:05,280 --> 03:54:06,840
Why is the baby always better?

5194
03:54:15,700 --> 03:54:18,040
There would be some good-ass treasure.

5195
03:54:19,400 --> 03:54:20,900
You're fucking baiting me into the well.

5196
03:54:31,480 --> 03:54:32,000
What?

5197
03:54:32,960 --> 03:54:34,260
How concord is that?

5198
03:54:50,550 --> 03:54:51,590
That's fucking...

5199
03:54:53,210 --> 03:54:53,950
Oh no.

5200
03:54:54,070 --> 03:54:55,070
Is it worth it?

5201
03:54:57,390 --> 03:55:00,550
Health recovery is half, but attack is increased.

5202
03:55:02,570 --> 03:55:03,330
You know what?

5203
03:55:03,350 --> 03:55:03,690
You're right.

5204
03:55:03,870 --> 03:55:04,390
Ungabunga.

5205
03:55:08,040 --> 03:55:10,640
Wait, and the child never talks to me?

5206
03:55:10,940 --> 03:55:13,740
He literally baited me into the fucking well.

5207
03:55:13,740 --> 03:55:14,700
And then disappears.

5208
03:55:15,420 --> 03:55:17,960
And then fucking disappears.

5209
03:55:18,560 --> 03:55:19,940
I fucking hate children.

5210
03:55:20,340 --> 03:55:22,740
He actually disappears.

5211
03:55:26,420 --> 03:55:28,420
Oh my god.

5212
03:55:29,780 --> 03:55:31,500
What an epic...

5213
03:55:31,500 --> 03:55:33,640
Oh my god, what an epic prank.

5214
03:55:36,480 --> 03:55:38,260
What a fucking troll.

5215
03:55:38,880 --> 03:55:43,060
Oh my god, Kappa's baby actually baited me.

5216
03:55:43,740 --> 03:55:45,160
Oh my god.

5217
03:55:46,820 --> 03:55:48,280
Where is the seller?

5218
03:55:52,000 --> 03:55:54,080
That's what I call a pro ghost move.

5219
03:55:54,620 --> 03:55:57,080
The child who cried tiger.

5220
03:55:58,280 --> 03:56:00,280
He got his TikTok video.

5221
03:56:02,360 --> 03:56:03,480
He's like, I'm out.

5222
03:56:04,140 --> 03:56:05,220
Got my video.

5223
03:56:07,240 --> 03:56:08,580
Hey, what's this then?

5224
03:56:08,840 --> 03:56:09,780
Where's this go?

5225
03:56:11,320 --> 03:56:12,880
Yellow wind formation.

5226
03:56:13,520 --> 03:56:16,880
You salvaged his soul and he moved on to the afterlife.

5227
03:56:17,220 --> 03:56:17,840
Very good.

5228
03:56:17,880 --> 03:56:18,700
Thank you for the super chat.

5229
03:56:18,840 --> 03:56:19,140
Thank you.

5230
03:56:19,160 --> 03:56:19,720
Thank you.

5231
03:56:19,780 --> 03:56:20,600
Where am I?

5232
03:56:21,780 --> 03:56:23,620
Oh, I don't know if I'm supposed to be here.

5233
03:56:27,900 --> 03:56:28,780
I just...

5234
03:56:31,920 --> 03:56:32,800
I just...

5235
03:56:33,500 --> 03:56:35,420
I just got out of a boss fight.

5236
03:56:36,360 --> 03:56:36,800
I...

5237
03:56:39,940 --> 03:56:40,380
I...

5238
03:56:41,140 --> 03:56:44,100
I just got out of a boss fight.

5239
03:56:51,280 --> 03:56:52,960
This is mine.

5240
03:56:58,040 --> 03:57:07,780
I just got out of a boss fight.

5241
03:57:07,800 --> 03:57:08,080
I took you away, need your help.

5242
03:57:08,080 --> 03:57:08,640
I was trying to get you extend...

5243
03:57:08,640 --> 03:57:08,920
He took out your couch.

5244
03:57:09,040 --> 03:57:11,400
Oh, Jack, I knew this would happen.

5245
03:57:11,440 --> 03:57:11,460
Now we're up against a guy who I'm in.

5246
03:57:11,460 --> 03:57:12,080
You're out now.

5247
03:57:12,080 --> 03:57:13,800
Here we go.

5248
03:57:13,800 --> 03:57:14,360
I just got here.

5249
03:57:15,500 --> 03:57:18,300
Oh my god, please.

5250
03:57:18,800 --> 03:57:20,260
Holy shit.

5251
03:57:31,520 --> 03:57:34,700
Is it even worth fighting him?

5252
03:57:34,760 --> 03:57:36,060
He has to be optional.

5253
03:57:37,720 --> 03:57:40,060
Another boss fight.

5254
03:57:40,060 --> 03:57:41,780
Thank you for the super chat.

5255
03:57:41,860 --> 03:57:42,180
Thank you.

5256
03:57:45,940 --> 03:57:49,260
He has to be optional.

5257
03:57:51,200 --> 03:57:53,860
He had a cutscene.

5258
03:57:54,540 --> 03:57:57,160
He's the last boss of chat.

5259
03:57:57,240 --> 03:57:58,580
How did I get here?

5260
03:57:59,300 --> 03:58:02,820
How the fuck did I get here?

5261
03:58:03,500 --> 03:58:06,320
He's apparently the last boss.

5262
03:58:07,200 --> 03:58:08,640
Oh, that's the door.

5263
03:58:10,060 --> 03:58:12,000
Wait, is that the door I opened earlier?

5264
03:58:13,520 --> 03:58:14,740
No, that's not...

5265
03:58:14,740 --> 03:58:15,900
Oh, that's the door.

5266
03:58:16,420 --> 03:58:18,700
Okay, I found...

5267
03:58:18,700 --> 03:58:22,220
Guys, I found where the door was supposed to go.

5268
03:58:22,800 --> 03:58:23,440
Okay.

5269
03:58:25,940 --> 03:58:27,500
Oh my god.

5270
03:58:33,100 --> 03:58:36,020
Life is actually a cruel joke.

5271
03:58:37,840 --> 03:58:39,920
There must be something in the back.

5272
03:58:41,520 --> 03:58:43,880
There has to be something back here.

5273
03:58:47,120 --> 03:58:48,580
Okay, what's the quest?

5274
03:58:48,760 --> 03:58:49,300
Is it this guy?

5275
03:58:50,860 --> 03:58:51,460
Hello.

5276
03:58:54,480 --> 03:58:55,940
Oh, it's time to meditate.

5277
03:58:58,600 --> 03:59:00,000
I hate children.

5278
03:59:03,980 --> 03:59:05,580
Today I... dear diary.

5279
03:59:05,880 --> 03:59:08,020
Today I got baited into the well.

5280
03:59:08,020 --> 03:59:11,540
He said he had... there was some cool stuff in there.

5281
03:59:11,960 --> 03:59:14,660
I knew it when they said stranger danger.

5282
03:59:15,360 --> 03:59:17,780
They meant stranger danger.

5283
03:59:18,040 --> 03:59:20,760
Never follow children under... to wells.

5284
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:23,180
It's never a good idea.

5285
03:59:23,220 --> 03:59:24,900
Even if they promised Ninja Turtles.

5286
03:59:24,920 --> 03:59:25,700
Meditation over.

5287
03:59:30,840 --> 03:59:31,440
Okay.

5288
03:59:32,940 --> 03:59:34,280
Oh my god.

5289
03:59:34,320 --> 03:59:37,040
Don't follow strange children into wells, guys.

5290
03:59:37,200 --> 03:59:39,020
That's my life lesson for you today.

5291
03:59:40,640 --> 03:59:42,020
I'll grab health too.

5292
03:59:42,180 --> 03:59:44,440
Like, I fucking need this at this point.

5293
03:59:46,140 --> 03:59:47,020
I'll get mana.

5294
03:59:48,760 --> 03:59:49,540
Let's see.

5295
03:59:52,460 --> 03:59:53,500
Is this the quest?

5296
03:59:54,320 --> 03:59:54,840
Oh!

5297
04:00:01,360 --> 04:00:02,500
Oh, that's it?

5298
04:00:02,580 --> 04:00:03,080
Oh, that's it?

5299
04:00:03,300 --> 04:00:04,120
Oh, that's it?

5300
04:00:04,240 --> 04:00:04,360
Oh, that's it?

5301
04:00:04,460 --> 04:00:05,080
Oh, that's it?

5302
04:00:06,660 --> 04:00:07,460
Oh, that's it?

5303
04:00:09,240 --> 04:00:09,760
Oh, that's it?

5304
04:00:09,760 --> 04:00:10,540
One step.

5305
04:00:11,360 --> 04:00:22,020
A match game?

5306
04:00:22,100 --> 04:00:22,900
One guy by child.

5307
04:00:23,200 --> 04:00:25,380
Couldn't beat me... your diary.

5308
04:00:25,660 --> 04:00:27,780
Today I got one guy by a child.

5309
04:00:32,660 --> 04:00:35,600
Have I truly hit rock bottom?

5310
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:44,520
I just remembered, I need to turn back my settings for that area.

5311
04:00:45,160 --> 04:00:45,800
Alright.

5312
04:00:48,800 --> 04:00:49,440
T.

5313
04:00:50,240 --> 04:00:53,760
I think playing on mouse and keyboard is definitely a lot easier for me.

5314
04:00:53,880 --> 04:00:57,880
I'm glad I played it on MNK instead of controller.

5315
04:01:00,040 --> 04:01:03,760
These are life lessons I will take going forward.

5316
04:01:08,470 --> 04:01:09,110
Alright.

5317
04:01:13,110 --> 04:01:14,750
Did you swap the jump button?

5318
04:01:14,930 --> 04:01:15,950
No, I'm using controller.

5319
04:01:16,130 --> 04:01:19,610
I feel like jump is only used for exploring IMO.

5320
04:01:22,870 --> 04:01:25,450
I'm trying to find... Okay, we gotta go to that rock.

5321
04:01:25,510 --> 04:01:25,830
Okay.

5322
04:01:31,060 --> 04:01:32,180
What's wrong with her?

5323
04:01:32,340 --> 04:01:34,540
I fucking killed two tigers today!

5324
04:01:36,800 --> 04:01:38,560
All with MNK!

5325
04:01:44,600 --> 04:01:46,280
That's called being a fucking gamer.

5326
04:01:47,240 --> 04:01:48,440
Alright, let's see.

5327
04:01:48,660 --> 04:01:49,540
What is it called?

5328
04:01:51,540 --> 04:01:53,920
What is that rock place called, chat?

5329
04:01:56,320 --> 04:01:56,800
Dargoons?

5330
04:01:56,980 --> 04:01:57,780
What was it called?

5331
04:01:58,520 --> 04:02:03,000
You wanted to be a Y-mom so it does let you experience a child tricking you into Tony the Tiger.

5332
04:02:03,220 --> 04:02:03,820
How thoughtful.

5333
04:02:04,180 --> 04:02:06,060
Thank you for the super chat.

5334
04:02:06,200 --> 04:02:07,200
Thank you, thank you.

5335
04:02:07,200 --> 04:02:09,600
That was not Tony the Tiger.

5336
04:02:09,880 --> 04:02:11,180
That was Frank the Tank.

5337
04:02:16,400 --> 04:02:17,280
Raw Clash.

5338
04:02:20,990 --> 04:02:22,870
I guess it's the Buddha eyes, right?

5339
04:02:23,410 --> 04:02:25,730
Like, I have to find six Buddha eyes.

5340
04:02:34,700 --> 04:02:35,260
Oh, hey.

5341
04:02:36,580 --> 04:02:37,680
No, that's where I was.

5342
04:02:38,640 --> 04:02:39,820
What am I doing?

5343
04:02:42,540 --> 04:02:43,300
Here we go.

5344
04:02:43,420 --> 04:02:44,840
This is where I...

5345
04:02:47,580 --> 04:02:48,460
This is...

5346
04:02:50,220 --> 04:02:51,500
This was always like this.

5347
04:02:52,400 --> 04:02:54,260
There was no rock monster here.

5348
04:02:54,720 --> 04:02:57,320
There never was the rock monsters here.

5349
04:03:00,740 --> 04:03:02,080
Alright, where do I go?

5350
04:03:06,790 --> 04:03:08,330
Okay, we gotta get rid of this guy.

5351
04:03:08,770 --> 04:03:10,570
This guy fucked me up last time.

5352
04:03:10,630 --> 04:03:11,130
I don't care.

5353
04:03:11,630 --> 04:03:13,550
I will fuck him up this time.

5354
04:03:14,270 --> 04:03:14,990
That's right.

5355
04:03:15,790 --> 04:03:16,610
That's right!

5356
04:03:17,570 --> 04:03:18,050
Boom!

5357
04:03:19,350 --> 04:03:21,270
You ain't gonna fuck me up this time.

5358
04:03:21,270 --> 04:03:22,490
I learned my lesson.

5359
04:03:24,570 --> 04:03:25,050
Yeah.

5360
04:03:25,510 --> 04:03:26,490
There was never...

5361
04:03:26,490 --> 04:03:27,570
Who said rock monsters?

5362
04:03:27,790 --> 04:03:29,330
There was never any rock whatever.

5363
04:03:31,570 --> 04:03:32,050
Oh!

5364
04:03:34,110 --> 04:03:34,590
Yeah!

5365
04:03:37,810 --> 04:03:38,750
Oh, that's a lot.

5366
04:03:39,750 --> 04:03:41,270
That's a lot of archers.

5367
04:03:42,350 --> 04:03:43,310
Spooky archers.

5368
04:03:45,010 --> 04:03:45,730
Wrong way.

5369
04:03:45,870 --> 04:03:46,750
Where am I going?

5370
04:03:47,430 --> 04:03:50,170
Okay, I might be going the wrong way, but there's loot.

5371
04:03:50,870 --> 04:03:51,390
Guys.

5372
04:03:52,990 --> 04:03:55,270
No way is the wrong way when there's loot.

5373
04:03:59,380 --> 04:04:01,400
Guys, it's never the wrong way.

5374
04:04:07,510 --> 04:04:09,430
I didn't go the wrong way.

5375
04:04:09,490 --> 04:04:10,750
I just wanted loot.

5376
04:04:14,330 --> 04:04:16,370
I didn't explore this cave yet.

5377
04:04:21,910 --> 04:04:23,790
Where the fuck is this place?

5378
04:04:26,370 --> 04:04:26,990
What?

5379
04:04:33,600 --> 04:04:35,240
What the fuck?

5380
04:04:38,750 --> 04:04:40,210
Okay, I did not expect that.

5381
04:04:40,290 --> 04:04:41,670
Holy shit.

5382
04:04:41,850 --> 04:04:43,330
That actually scared the shit out of me.

5383
04:04:43,550 --> 04:04:46,550
Oh, my God.

5384
04:04:47,610 --> 04:04:49,910
Like, where did he come from?

5385
04:04:50,350 --> 04:04:51,970
No, I'm getting poisoned!

5386
04:04:52,530 --> 04:04:53,790
This is stupid!

5387
04:04:53,790 --> 04:04:54,170
OPEN!

5388
04:04:57,570 --> 04:04:58,410
Oh god.

5389
04:05:00,570 --> 04:05:02,550
AND MY ATTACK'S STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

5390
04:05:03,790 --> 04:05:05,170
Oh my god, there we go.

5391
04:05:07,850 --> 04:05:11,330
Oh my god, does these guys remind me of the Silent Hill?

5392
04:05:14,930 --> 04:05:16,130
JESUS CHRIST!

5393
04:05:19,850 --> 04:05:22,010
Oh my god, he's kicking me!

5394
04:05:22,010 --> 04:05:24,130
He's kicking me!

5395
04:05:25,050 --> 04:05:27,050
That's why he's so strong!

5396
04:05:32,650 --> 04:05:35,030
Holy shit, I have no more heals.

5397
04:05:35,050 --> 04:05:36,050
Thank god I have heals.

5398
04:05:36,310 --> 04:05:39,150
I was gonna say I have no more heals after that.

5399
04:05:40,110 --> 04:05:41,270
What is in here?

5400
04:05:43,530 --> 04:05:44,070
Hello?

5401
04:05:48,270 --> 04:05:48,810
Oh?

5402
04:05:52,550 --> 04:05:53,030
Oh!

5403
04:05:54,230 --> 04:05:55,710
Guys, I don't think I like that.

5404
04:05:55,890 --> 04:05:56,990
Mother of Stones?

5405
04:05:57,410 --> 04:05:58,090
Does that mean...

5406
04:05:58,090 --> 04:05:58,250
OH!

5407
04:06:00,910 --> 04:06:01,390
Guys...

5408
04:06:02,510 --> 04:06:04,930
Guys, I don't think... I don't think I like that.

5409
04:06:05,050 --> 04:06:06,470
Okay, I don't like this gourd.

5410
04:06:06,570 --> 04:06:07,510
I don't like this gourd.

5411
04:06:07,630 --> 04:06:08,690
Bring me back.

5412
04:06:08,830 --> 04:06:10,450
Bring me back to a healed gourd.

5413
04:06:10,790 --> 04:06:13,490
Bring me back to a healed gourd.

5414
04:06:14,530 --> 04:06:15,010
Hair.

5415
04:06:15,450 --> 04:06:17,570
Oh, it interrupted my hair!

5416
04:06:18,910 --> 04:06:19,390
No.

5417
04:06:23,970 --> 04:06:24,630
Okay.

5418
04:06:24,950 --> 04:06:25,870
He's down.

5419
04:06:27,390 --> 04:06:29,130
Don't tell me they respawn.

5420
04:06:29,350 --> 04:06:29,950
Right?

5421
04:06:31,050 --> 04:06:33,490
Is this what Mother of Stone does?

5422
04:06:35,230 --> 04:06:35,890
No?

5423
04:06:36,070 --> 04:06:36,730
Okay.

5424
04:06:36,930 --> 04:06:38,310
It's over for you.

5425
04:06:38,710 --> 04:06:39,870
It's fucking...

5426
04:06:39,870 --> 04:06:40,610
OVER!

5427
04:06:42,390 --> 04:06:43,050
Fuck!

5428
04:06:47,960 --> 04:06:49,020
It's not over!

5429
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:50,500
It's not over!

5430
04:06:51,430 --> 04:06:52,860
It's not over!

5431
04:06:53,920 --> 04:06:55,240
Who would've thought?

5432
04:06:55,240 --> 04:06:56,800
Who would've thought?

5433
04:06:58,700 --> 04:06:59,440
Oh, no!

5434
04:06:59,720 --> 04:07:00,680
I was like...

5435
04:07:00,680 --> 04:07:03,240
What if, like, he doesn't respawn?

5436
04:07:04,520 --> 04:07:05,220
You know?

5437
04:07:06,020 --> 04:07:07,260
Wouldn't that be funny?

5438
04:07:11,500 --> 04:07:13,060
Alright, let's get rid of him first.

5439
04:07:13,440 --> 04:07:13,940
Alright.

5440
04:07:14,460 --> 04:07:15,220
I'm back.

5441
04:07:15,760 --> 04:07:16,880
I'm back for more.

5442
04:07:18,000 --> 04:07:19,040
That's fucking right.

5443
04:07:20,400 --> 04:07:21,320
Oh, shit.

5444
04:07:21,480 --> 04:07:22,380
Oh, shit.

5445
04:07:22,620 --> 04:07:23,680
He doesn't like that.

5446
04:07:25,240 --> 04:07:26,140
Oh, fuck!

5447
04:07:26,240 --> 04:07:26,800
There's two!

5448
04:07:29,280 --> 04:07:30,940
He definitely did not like that.

5449
04:07:31,040 --> 04:07:38,290
He definitely did not like that.

5450
04:07:39,330 --> 04:07:39,850
Boom!

5451
04:07:40,050 --> 04:07:41,010
That's fucking right.

5452
04:07:42,170 --> 04:07:43,070
Well, keep going.

5453
04:07:43,250 --> 04:07:44,490
I didn't learn my lesson yet.

5454
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:49,060
What the fuck?

5455
04:07:50,940 --> 04:07:52,480
You almost got me.

5456
04:07:54,900 --> 04:07:55,620
Oh, gosh.

5457
04:07:58,740 --> 04:07:59,360
Where's the other guy?

5458
04:07:59,580 --> 04:07:59,820
Oh!

5459
04:08:01,800 --> 04:08:02,560
Oh, shit!

5460
04:08:04,600 --> 04:08:05,200
Come on.

5461
04:08:07,000 --> 04:08:07,500
Poke!

5462
04:08:08,380 --> 04:08:09,080
I'm back.

5463
04:08:10,220 --> 04:08:11,500
I'm still gonna be here.

5464
04:08:11,760 --> 04:08:12,400
That's right.

5465
04:08:12,440 --> 04:08:13,660
You haven't lost me yet!

5466
04:08:14,960 --> 04:08:15,960
That's fucking right!

5467
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:16,500
I'm back!

5468
04:08:16,780 --> 04:08:17,920
I'm back, baby!

5469
04:08:22,510 --> 04:08:23,010
Yeah!

5470
04:08:25,770 --> 04:08:26,470
That's right.

5471
04:08:27,190 --> 04:08:29,650
I even kill mothers in-game.

5472
04:08:30,170 --> 04:08:30,670
Oh, shit.

5473
04:08:32,530 --> 04:08:33,250
Yeah!

5474
04:08:33,390 --> 04:08:33,710
Yeah!

5475
04:08:35,330 --> 04:08:37,430
Will anybody stop her?

5476
04:08:40,750 --> 04:08:45,550
Now, no one will ever need to pay for child support.

5477
04:08:50,490 --> 04:08:51,770
I did it.

5478
04:08:53,670 --> 04:08:55,830
Wukong is not a bad person.

5479
04:09:00,610 --> 04:09:01,330
No.

5480
04:09:01,470 --> 04:09:02,110
No.

5481
04:09:02,110 --> 04:09:05,690
Now, no one will have to pay child support.

5482
04:09:09,090 --> 04:09:09,730
Wait.

5483
04:09:09,810 --> 04:09:10,490
I can...

5484
04:09:11,290 --> 04:09:13,210
Is there, like, actually...

5485
04:09:13,210 --> 04:09:14,710
I can climb up?

5486
04:09:15,730 --> 04:09:16,790
There's no way.

5487
04:09:17,210 --> 04:09:18,250
Oh, my God.

5488
04:09:18,330 --> 04:09:19,110
Is that, like...

5489
04:09:21,610 --> 04:09:23,550
Wukong did nothing wrong.

5490
04:09:25,150 --> 04:09:26,390
The head outside?

5491
04:09:27,190 --> 04:09:27,830
What?

5492
04:09:29,630 --> 04:09:30,550
There's a head?

5493
04:09:34,090 --> 04:09:35,090
Oh, there it is.

5494
04:09:35,450 --> 04:09:36,330
There's the head.

5495
04:09:40,540 --> 04:09:41,060
Yoink.

5496
04:09:41,060 --> 04:09:41,820
My eye now.

5497
04:09:48,480 --> 04:09:49,000
Yeah!

5498
04:09:52,340 --> 04:09:52,860
Nice.

5499
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:54,140
We got another Buddha eye.

5500
04:09:58,030 --> 04:09:59,150
Four more to go.

5501
04:09:59,470 --> 04:10:00,450
That wasn't so bad.

5502
04:10:01,190 --> 04:10:02,910
Ever since the tiger incident.

5503
04:10:04,130 --> 04:10:05,610
Ever since I got one kid.

5504
04:10:06,170 --> 04:10:07,450
Things got a lot easier.

5505
04:10:12,670 --> 04:10:14,650
Ever since I got one kid.

5506
04:10:14,910 --> 04:10:16,410
I learned my lesson.

5507
04:10:19,370 --> 04:10:22,410
I told myself never to get one kid again.

5508
04:10:23,690 --> 04:10:24,670
Jesus Christ.

5509
04:10:24,730 --> 04:10:25,910
I hate these guys, actually.

5510
04:10:27,070 --> 04:10:32,530
Like, I'm tempted to literally just turn into the wolf guy just to get these guys out of my game.

5511
04:10:33,210 --> 04:10:34,070
Oh, he's dead.

5512
04:10:34,710 --> 04:10:35,230
Nice.

5513
04:10:36,810 --> 04:10:37,510
All right.

5514
04:10:38,030 --> 04:10:38,550
Wait.

5515
04:10:38,610 --> 04:10:39,270
There's another cave.

5516
04:10:40,810 --> 04:10:42,190
Where does this cave lead?

5517
04:10:42,270 --> 04:10:42,650
I don't know.

5518
04:10:50,130 --> 04:10:50,550
There's another cave.

5519
04:10:50,550 --> 04:10:51,430
Where does this cave go?

5520
04:10:53,570 --> 04:10:53,990
Oh.

5521
04:10:59,750 --> 04:11:00,830
Oh, I'm a little worried.

5522
04:11:01,630 --> 04:11:03,070
I don't know where I am.

5523
04:11:06,770 --> 04:11:08,870
I'm worried I don't know where I am.

5524
04:11:09,970 --> 04:11:11,370
Oh, there's another eye!

5525
04:11:20,120 --> 04:11:20,540
Okay.

5526
04:11:21,080 --> 04:11:21,860
I had to.

5527
04:11:22,040 --> 04:11:23,240
I was so scared.

5528
04:11:23,500 --> 04:11:25,160
I was so scared.

5529
04:11:25,200 --> 04:11:26,640
I didn't know what he was going to do to me.

5530
04:11:28,120 --> 04:11:28,540
Oh, you're just going to die.

5531
04:11:28,540 --> 04:11:30,420
Hey, give me the eye!

5532
04:11:32,360 --> 04:11:33,400
There's... Oh!

5533
04:11:33,740 --> 04:11:34,780
You fucker!

5534
04:11:37,680 --> 04:11:39,460
You try to be sneaky!

5535
04:11:40,720 --> 04:11:42,780
I was like, why can't I pick up the eye?

5536
04:11:46,400 --> 04:11:46,960
Alright.

5537
04:11:48,120 --> 04:11:48,680
Nice.

5538
04:11:56,360 --> 04:11:59,760
Now that I got the Buddha eye, it's time to...

5539
04:12:00,400 --> 04:12:02,360
It's time to beat up everything around it.

5540
04:12:04,580 --> 04:12:06,420
Alright, that's another eye.

5541
04:12:06,760 --> 04:12:07,280
Woah!

5542
04:12:07,700 --> 04:12:08,380
Woah!

5543
04:12:08,860 --> 04:12:09,700
Big boy!

5544
04:12:09,860 --> 04:12:10,440
Woah!

5545
04:12:10,720 --> 04:12:11,680
Big boy!

5546
04:12:14,220 --> 04:12:15,540
Now you're an orphan.

5547
04:12:18,460 --> 04:12:20,140
Don't have a mom now.

5548
04:12:21,560 --> 04:12:24,180
Baby can help you access two secret bosses?

5549
04:12:25,240 --> 04:12:26,140
Which baby?

5550
04:12:26,340 --> 04:12:27,680
There's so many... I killed...

5551
04:12:28,760 --> 04:12:33,020
You gotta be very specific on which baby it is.

5552
04:12:38,820 --> 04:12:39,980
Alright, nice.

5553
04:12:42,540 --> 04:12:42,880
Oh!

5554
04:12:43,160 --> 04:12:45,620
You can access secret bosses?

5555
04:12:46,320 --> 04:12:47,300
That's interesting.

5556
04:12:48,780 --> 04:12:49,920
Let's get closer.

5557
04:12:50,140 --> 04:12:50,740
Oh shit!

5558
04:12:52,880 --> 04:12:54,240
Guys, I'm very lost.

5559
04:12:55,320 --> 04:12:57,700
There's a lot of passageways.

5560
04:12:59,880 --> 04:13:02,160
The secret is that I'm always lost.

5561
04:13:02,560 --> 04:13:04,840
But like, now I'm exceptionally lost.

5562
04:13:07,660 --> 04:13:08,260
Oh!

5563
04:13:08,360 --> 04:13:09,500
God dammit!

5564
04:13:10,260 --> 04:13:11,020
That's right.

5565
04:13:11,900 --> 04:13:15,180
I cannot... These mimics are so fucking tanky.

5566
04:13:15,300 --> 04:13:17,840
I cannot be bothered to fight them normally.

5567
04:13:18,260 --> 04:13:19,900
They're way too tanky.

5568
04:13:21,400 --> 04:13:22,000
What?

5569
04:13:22,680 --> 04:13:23,960
How do I get up there?

5570
04:13:27,820 --> 04:13:28,840
There's too many.

5571
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:29,800
There's...

5572
04:13:30,720 --> 04:13:31,920
Oh my god!

5573
04:13:31,940 --> 04:13:33,160
Are you fucking kidding me?

5574
04:13:34,880 --> 04:13:38,780
How do I get up there?

5575
04:13:40,460 --> 04:13:41,840
I actually can... Oh wait!

5576
04:13:41,880 --> 04:13:42,880
There's a ton of them.

5577
04:13:44,480 --> 04:13:45,420
I'm gonna get you.

5578
04:13:46,840 --> 04:13:47,300
Oh.

5579
04:13:51,640 --> 04:13:53,780
Yeah, I'm getting good XP, which is nice.

5580
04:13:54,460 --> 04:13:58,240
I just always don't know what to upgrade with the XP, you know?

5581
04:13:59,700 --> 04:14:00,580
Was that it?

5582
04:14:01,260 --> 04:14:02,780
Oh, it was just a secret tunnel.

5583
04:14:03,640 --> 04:14:04,600
Secret tunnel!

5584
04:14:10,550 --> 04:14:11,470
I'll go this way.

5585
04:14:13,490 --> 04:14:14,290
Oh, nice!

5586
04:14:14,350 --> 04:14:14,970
There's an incense.

5587
04:14:20,930 --> 04:14:21,950
The buff rat?

5588
04:14:22,090 --> 04:14:22,550
Which one?

5589
04:14:23,890 --> 04:14:24,370
Guys.

5590
04:14:27,610 --> 04:14:30,290
There's a lot of very buff rats.

5591
04:14:35,650 --> 04:14:38,790
I'll never know which is the right rat.

5592
04:14:40,190 --> 04:14:41,670
I'll never know which is the right Poke!

5593
04:14:44,130 --> 04:14:44,730
Ow!

5594
04:14:45,470 --> 04:14:46,690
I tipped him over.

5595
04:14:46,790 --> 04:14:47,570
It's like tipping a cow.

5596
04:14:49,930 --> 04:14:51,730
I should be able to grab this now.

5597
04:14:52,110 --> 04:14:52,230
I should be able to grab this now.

5598
04:14:56,090 --> 04:14:56,690
Yay!

5599
04:14:57,730 --> 04:14:58,710
The last...

5600
04:14:58,710 --> 04:14:59,130
Which one?

5601
04:14:59,130 --> 04:15:01,270
You gotta be more specific.

5602
04:15:04,890 --> 04:15:08,950
Guys, you gotta be very specific on the buff rats.

5603
04:15:10,890 --> 04:15:11,530
Poke!

5604
04:15:15,890 --> 04:15:16,870
Oh, god.

5605
04:15:17,890 --> 04:15:19,110
Where am I?

5606
04:15:20,290 --> 04:15:22,970
All I'm doing is gathering eyes, but...

5607
04:15:24,270 --> 04:15:25,610
What is he guarding?

5608
04:15:29,420 --> 04:15:30,780
Have I been here before?

5609
04:15:31,260 --> 04:15:31,900
Poke!

5610
04:15:37,000 --> 04:15:38,080
Why'd you miss?

5611
04:15:38,560 --> 04:15:39,200
Why'd you miss?

5612
04:15:39,560 --> 04:15:40,200
Loser.

5613
04:15:42,720 --> 04:15:44,320
You killed a baby.

5614
04:15:44,440 --> 04:15:47,520
Do you have any idea how little that narrows it down?

5615
04:15:47,840 --> 04:15:50,140
Thank you for the super chat, Gary.

5616
04:15:50,280 --> 04:15:50,740
Thank you.

5617
04:15:50,980 --> 04:15:52,840
Oh, this was the...

5618
04:15:52,840 --> 04:15:55,360
This was the main area.

5619
04:15:55,900 --> 04:15:57,520
Sorry, I went the...

5620
04:15:57,520 --> 04:15:59,960
I went the secret entrance.

5621
04:16:04,960 --> 04:16:08,340
This was how... This was the one where you guys were like, No, the other way!

5622
04:16:08,500 --> 04:16:09,340
And I was like, huh?

5623
04:16:10,440 --> 04:16:11,320
But there's cave.

5624
04:16:12,780 --> 04:16:14,060
Guys, I found the other way.

5625
04:16:16,320 --> 04:16:18,900
I found the actual area I was supposed to go.

5626
04:16:21,780 --> 04:16:22,840
Oh, but there's a bridge.

5627
04:16:22,980 --> 04:16:24,620
I've never seen this bridge before.

5628
04:16:31,920 --> 04:16:32,960
But cave though!

5629
04:16:33,280 --> 04:16:33,680
Exactly!

5630
04:16:34,280 --> 04:16:34,680
Cave!

5631
04:16:39,300 --> 04:16:40,220
Where am I?

5632
04:16:43,140 --> 04:16:44,600
Where the fuck am I?

5633
04:16:48,440 --> 04:16:49,600
What is this place?

5634
04:16:52,040 --> 04:16:52,800
Oh, hey!

5635
04:16:57,160 --> 04:16:57,820
What's this?

5636
04:17:04,800 --> 04:17:07,920
Is this where I killed the first big buff rat?

5637
04:17:08,160 --> 04:17:09,760
Oh, is this where I killed the dad?

5638
04:17:11,160 --> 04:17:11,680
Oh!

5639
04:17:11,840 --> 04:17:12,740
No, the son!

5640
04:17:14,340 --> 04:17:15,240
The son!

5641
04:17:15,240 --> 04:17:16,600
The son with like, head issues.

5642
04:17:18,720 --> 04:17:19,920
Now where am I?

5643
04:17:22,960 --> 04:17:24,560
The where am I game.

5644
04:17:26,960 --> 04:17:27,920
What is this?

5645
04:17:28,720 --> 04:17:30,360
Wait, I got the shortcut!

5646
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:34,280
Oh, I unlocked the shortcut!

5647
04:17:35,600 --> 04:17:38,860
What the fuck is the point of shortcuts when I have fast travel?

5648
04:17:43,040 --> 04:17:44,640
Time to break the wall?

5649
04:17:48,500 --> 04:17:49,080
Where wall?

5650
04:17:50,480 --> 04:17:51,040
This wall?

5651
04:17:54,910 --> 04:17:56,410
Guys, there's not...

5652
04:17:56,410 --> 04:17:57,350
There's a lot of walls.

5653
04:18:02,710 --> 04:18:05,350
Guys, there's a lot of walls.

5654
04:18:06,770 --> 04:18:09,290
You have to be very specific.

5655
04:18:11,870 --> 04:18:13,570
On the wall.

5656
04:18:13,870 --> 04:18:15,950
On the wall.

5657
04:18:15,950 --> 04:18:16,410
On the wall.

5658
04:18:16,410 --> 04:18:16,450
Here?

5659
04:18:22,840 --> 04:18:23,600
Here.

5660
04:18:28,730 --> 04:18:29,490
Here.

5661
04:18:32,170 --> 04:18:33,670
Now which wall?

5662
04:18:35,170 --> 04:18:36,250
That wall.

5663
04:18:36,830 --> 04:18:38,070
Is it this wall?

5664
04:18:39,550 --> 04:18:40,750
Oh shit, nice.

5665
04:18:44,770 --> 04:18:45,830
Drop down.

5666
04:18:46,190 --> 04:18:46,710
Okay.

5667
04:18:50,370 --> 04:18:50,890
Wall.

5668
04:19:01,560 --> 04:19:02,080
Purple.

5669
04:19:04,700 --> 04:19:05,520
That's a wall.

5670
04:19:08,480 --> 04:19:09,340
That wall.

5671
04:19:09,460 --> 04:19:09,960
This wall?

5672
04:19:13,430 --> 04:19:14,170
Buddha wall.

5673
04:19:15,130 --> 04:19:16,690
There's a wall with the Buddha?

5674
04:19:17,610 --> 04:19:18,930
Oh, that is the wall!

5675
04:19:19,350 --> 04:19:20,390
God, I'm so smart.

5676
04:19:21,950 --> 04:19:23,610
You guys want to watch me die really fast?

5677
04:19:25,610 --> 04:19:26,330
Oh, okay.

5678
04:19:27,690 --> 04:19:28,930
In I go.

5679
04:19:29,170 --> 04:19:29,810
See?

5680
04:19:29,990 --> 04:19:34,150
In one day, people have already found the baby wall!

5681
04:19:34,650 --> 04:19:36,790
In just one day!

5682
04:19:40,490 --> 04:19:43,410
Vacciners have already found the baby wall!

5683
04:19:43,850 --> 04:19:46,290
Look at what one day can give us!

5684
04:19:46,890 --> 04:19:47,830
Oh, this is not...

5685
04:19:47,830 --> 04:19:49,630
I think you guys took me to a boss fight.

5686
04:19:51,250 --> 04:19:56,070
I think you guys took... Oh, hey.

5687
04:19:56,330 --> 04:19:57,450
Oh, this is just treasure.

5688
04:19:58,310 --> 04:19:59,330
Oh, thank god.

5689
04:20:02,930 --> 04:20:04,030
Oh, thank god.

5690
04:20:04,030 --> 04:20:04,130
Oh, thank god.

5691
04:20:04,130 --> 04:20:04,690
It's just loot.

5692
04:20:05,970 --> 04:20:07,210
What did I get?

5693
04:20:10,070 --> 04:20:14,530
What did I get?

5694
04:20:16,870 --> 04:20:17,550
...

5695
04:20:17,550 --> 04:20:18,630
...

5696
04:20:18,630 --> 04:20:18,830
...

5697
04:20:20,210 --> 04:20:20,890
...

5698
04:20:25,940 --> 04:20:28,180
Oh, it's a secret boss key?

5699
04:20:29,260 --> 04:20:30,620
What was the point?!

5700
04:20:31,840 --> 04:20:34,980
Guys, I don't think I will be doing any...

5701
04:20:34,980 --> 04:20:39,100
I don't know if I'll be doing any secret bosses.

5702
04:20:47,240 --> 04:20:52,160
All right, I already lost track of where... oh we were trying to find buddha eyes.

5703
04:20:52,280 --> 04:20:54,200
I was like, what was my main mission again?

5704
04:20:54,680 --> 04:20:58,400
We've taken so many detours.

5705
04:20:58,640 --> 04:21:02,640
We already forgot what the main mission was.

5706
04:21:02,920 --> 04:21:05,180
We have to find buddha eyes.

5707
04:21:05,780 --> 04:21:10,860
That was the main... oh no, where was the entrance again?

5708
04:21:12,380 --> 04:21:15,060
It was... was it this way?

5709
04:21:15,900 --> 04:21:16,380
Where?

5710
04:21:16,980 --> 04:21:17,720
Oh no.

5711
04:21:18,360 --> 04:21:19,560
No, it was up here.

5712
04:21:23,420 --> 04:21:24,580
It was up here.

5713
04:21:25,180 --> 04:21:26,440
And then it was up here.

5714
04:21:27,340 --> 04:21:28,020
All right.

5715
04:21:29,120 --> 04:21:29,780
Where am I?

5716
04:21:29,980 --> 04:21:30,740
Was it west?

5717
04:21:32,520 --> 04:21:33,600
Where was I headed?

5718
04:21:33,680 --> 04:21:34,380
West, right?

5719
04:21:36,460 --> 04:21:37,500
We're heading west.

5720
04:21:41,220 --> 04:21:41,700
Okay.

5721
04:21:41,760 --> 04:21:42,180
Okay.

5722
04:21:44,160 --> 04:21:48,020
Um, and then from here, I came from this way.

5723
04:21:49,800 --> 04:21:51,380
This is where I came from.

5724
04:21:53,660 --> 04:21:54,800
I'm still running.

5725
04:21:54,880 --> 04:21:56,120
I'll never stop running.

5726
04:21:56,840 --> 04:21:57,560
I'm running.

5727
04:21:57,760 --> 04:21:58,400
Where are you?

5728
04:21:58,620 --> 04:22:00,320
Where are you trying to run to?

5729
04:22:00,560 --> 04:22:02,220
Don't hear from my demons.

5730
04:22:06,800 --> 04:22:08,120
I need to run.

5731
04:22:08,220 --> 04:22:11,040
If I stop, if I stop, they'll get me.

5732
04:22:11,980 --> 04:22:12,880
Wait, where's this?

5733
04:22:15,420 --> 04:22:16,500
Where am I?

5734
04:22:17,080 --> 04:22:17,880
What?

5735
04:22:17,960 --> 04:22:18,600
Have I been here before?

5736
04:22:19,700 --> 04:22:22,120
What the fuck am I?

5737
04:22:23,760 --> 04:22:26,660
Oh, this is the... this is the frog.

5738
04:22:26,920 --> 04:22:28,600
THIS IS THE FROG.

5739
04:22:31,340 --> 04:22:34,240
I fucking hate sad Ladd.

5740
04:22:37,320 --> 04:22:38,120
Bro.

5741
04:22:38,120 --> 04:22:40,520
Oh my god I swear.

5742
04:22:42,240 --> 04:22:43,640
The sad.

5743
04:22:43,720 --> 04:22:44,440
The sad.

5744
04:22:45,220 --> 04:22:47,780
No, I have to go back to the booth!

5745
04:22:51,640 --> 04:22:52,700
Oh hey,

5746
04:22:56,020 --> 04:22:56,500
I gathered.

5747
04:22:56,900 --> 04:23:00,240
Guys, if I wasn't lost, I wouldn't be able to gather this.

5748
04:23:02,340 --> 04:23:04,520
Guys, this was actually Sandland Part 9.

5749
04:23:05,960 --> 04:23:06,680
Where am I?

5750
04:23:07,400 --> 04:23:08,380
Where is this place?

5751
04:23:11,020 --> 04:23:12,160
Where am I?

5752
04:23:13,440 --> 04:23:14,880
Oh, I found... Oh, meditation!

5753
04:23:22,170 --> 04:23:22,870
Where am I?

5754
04:23:33,850 --> 04:23:36,440
Is this the... This is Wendy's?

5755
04:23:38,240 --> 04:23:40,920
We're still on Chapter 2.

5756
04:23:48,150 --> 04:23:50,920
We found... We found... Hey, we found this!

5757
04:23:54,000 --> 04:23:55,880
Holy shit!

5758
04:23:56,160 --> 04:23:58,580
We're still here?!

5759
04:23:58,870 --> 04:24:00,140
Oh my god!

5760
04:24:03,140 --> 04:24:04,760
Oh, we're still here!

5761
04:24:13,040 --> 04:24:14,600
Oh my god.

5762
04:24:14,760 --> 04:24:16,220
I feel like...

5763
04:24:16,220 --> 04:24:19,460
How do I fast travel to the nearest shrine?!

5764
04:24:20,240 --> 04:24:22,400
How do I do that?!

5765
04:24:22,400 --> 04:24:24,420
I don't know, I'm stupid.

5766
04:24:26,880 --> 04:24:28,360
Oh my god, I'm gonna use this.

5767
04:24:28,480 --> 04:24:28,960
Fuck this.

5768
04:24:29,240 --> 04:24:30,920
I'm sorry, Wukong 2.

5769
04:24:31,380 --> 04:24:33,040
Oh shit, instant transmission!

5770
04:24:39,620 --> 04:24:41,580
Oh my god, I made it.

5771
04:24:41,660 --> 04:24:43,060
Where is... Where am I?

5772
04:24:45,180 --> 04:24:47,040
Actually, where am I?

5773
04:24:48,680 --> 04:24:50,500
Where is this place?

5774
04:24:51,140 --> 04:24:54,000
I don't remember if they all look the same!

5775
04:24:55,060 --> 04:24:56,940
Everything looks the same!

5776
04:24:57,060 --> 04:24:58,240
I can't tell!

5777
04:24:59,680 --> 04:25:01,800
Where did I go?!

5778
04:25:04,560 --> 04:25:05,760
Where have I...

5779
04:25:05,760 --> 04:25:06,640
Oh, please!

5780
04:25:06,640 --> 04:25:09,120
You're not important enough to me!

5781
04:25:10,620 --> 04:25:12,520
Where is more Buddha?

5782
04:25:16,420 --> 04:25:17,220
Whoa!

5783
04:25:18,380 --> 04:25:19,100
Hello, sir!

5784
04:25:21,520 --> 04:25:23,180
I'm still lost!

5785
04:25:23,460 --> 04:25:24,580
It didn't help!

5786
04:25:29,580 --> 04:25:33,920
The sad part is that I'm still just as lost.

5787
04:25:34,240 --> 04:25:35,700
Like, I feel like...

5788
04:25:36,960 --> 04:25:39,920
I feel like I did not get better.

5789
04:25:40,260 --> 04:25:40,560
I...

5790
04:25:41,780 --> 04:25:43,520
Oh no, please!

5791
04:25:46,360 --> 04:25:47,160
Fuck this.

5792
04:25:47,340 --> 04:25:47,800
I can't.

5793
04:25:47,900 --> 04:25:48,960
Your baby time.

5794
04:25:49,440 --> 04:25:51,220
I will fucking bring out...

5795
04:25:51,840 --> 04:25:53,400
I've been lost for too...

5796
04:25:53,400 --> 04:25:55,080
I've been traveling for too long!

5797
04:25:57,760 --> 04:25:59,460
Oh hey, there's a chest though!

5798
04:26:02,520 --> 04:26:03,480
I can't.

5799
04:26:03,480 --> 04:26:05,100
I've been traveling for too long!

5800
04:26:05,180 --> 04:26:05,680
I can't.

5801
04:26:05,680 --> 04:26:05,680
I've been traveling for too long!

5802
04:26:09,240 --> 04:26:10,680
Alright, mine core.

5803
04:26:11,480 --> 04:26:13,120
Because I'm a super freak.

5804
04:26:15,620 --> 04:26:16,840
Guys, that wasn't...

5805
04:26:17,500 --> 04:26:19,200
Guys, I did not go the right way.

5806
04:26:21,440 --> 04:26:22,460
Maybe it's...

5807
04:26:22,460 --> 04:26:23,660
This way?

5808
04:26:27,220 --> 04:26:27,740
Where...

5809
04:26:27,740 --> 04:26:29,340
Where is the Buddha?

5810
04:26:31,120 --> 04:26:33,360
Where the fuck are the Buddha eyes?

5811
04:26:34,400 --> 04:26:35,200
There it is!

5812
04:26:35,260 --> 04:26:35,680
I see one!

5813
04:26:35,680 --> 04:26:37,220
Oh, what the...

5814
04:26:41,410 --> 04:26:42,770
Who fucking...

5815
04:26:43,470 --> 04:26:44,790
Who hit me?

5816
04:26:45,030 --> 04:26:47,150
Who threw a rock at me?

5817
04:26:50,750 --> 04:26:51,910
Who is that?

5818
04:26:52,930 --> 04:26:54,390
Who threw the rock?

5819
04:26:54,630 --> 04:26:55,490
Show yourself!

5820
04:26:55,750 --> 04:26:55,950
Oh!

5821
04:26:57,330 --> 04:26:59,250
Show yourself right now!

5822
04:26:59,650 --> 04:27:02,050
You think you can hide from me?

5823
04:27:02,410 --> 04:27:04,370
I learned how to jump!

5824
04:27:04,810 --> 04:27:06,590
I learned how to jump!

5825
04:27:06,590 --> 04:27:07,490
Wait, maybe...

5826
04:27:09,330 --> 04:27:10,410
That's fucking right!

5827
04:27:11,010 --> 04:27:11,790
There's stairs!

5828
04:27:12,650 --> 04:27:14,930
I could have used the stairs!

5829
04:27:16,890 --> 04:27:18,310
God damn it!

5830
04:27:18,310 --> 04:27:19,930
I could have used the stairs!

5831
04:27:22,230 --> 04:27:23,050
Oh, come here!

5832
04:27:23,250 --> 04:27:24,870
Wait, who told me to come over?

5833
04:27:27,670 --> 04:27:28,570
Who said that?

5834
04:27:30,590 --> 04:27:32,250
Someone was like, come here, come here!

5835
04:27:34,670 --> 04:27:37,850
Mom told me not to trust strangers after what...

5836
04:27:37,850 --> 04:27:41,210
After I encountered Frank the Tank.

5837
04:27:45,040 --> 04:27:46,280
Another child.

5838
04:27:46,820 --> 04:27:48,960
I will not get one kid again.

5839
04:27:53,700 --> 04:27:56,600
I will never trust another...

5840
04:27:56,600 --> 04:27:59,460
Another stranger after the kid incident.

5841
04:28:00,660 --> 04:28:02,500
See, I missed the chest here.

5842
04:28:06,570 --> 04:28:07,330
Nice!

5843
04:28:08,690 --> 04:28:09,450
Got gold!

5844
04:28:10,390 --> 04:28:12,290
Oh, the last Buddha head is right over here.

5845
04:28:12,430 --> 04:28:13,130
Oh, there he is!

5846
04:28:14,650 --> 04:28:16,570
I'm gonna grab the last Buddha head first.

5847
04:28:24,840 --> 04:28:25,280
Yoink!

5848
04:28:25,340 --> 04:28:26,100
Got your eyes!

5849
04:28:36,290 --> 04:28:38,070
So who told me to come over?

5850
04:28:42,910 --> 04:28:44,650
You heard that guy, right?

5851
04:28:44,650 --> 04:28:45,370
He's like, come here, come here!

5852
04:28:46,870 --> 04:28:47,810
Where is that from?

5853
04:28:49,670 --> 04:28:50,630
Down the water?

5854
04:28:51,110 --> 04:28:51,550
Alright.

5855
04:28:54,950 --> 04:28:56,070
What, he just...

5856
04:28:56,070 --> 04:28:56,530
Okay.

5857
04:28:57,950 --> 04:28:58,550
Yeah?

5858
04:29:00,450 --> 04:29:01,050
Oh!

5859
04:29:01,870 --> 04:29:02,470
What the...

5860
04:29:02,470 --> 04:29:03,610
I am trapped in the stone?

5861
04:29:04,310 --> 04:29:07,550
Even the stone on the head has been transformed into a crystal.

5862
04:29:07,750 --> 04:29:10,770
I have been surprised by a stone crystal in that cave.

5863
04:29:11,470 --> 04:29:13,710
It must contain some secrets.

5864
04:29:14,090 --> 04:29:17,250
After all the things I have done, I can now get to mäu!

5865
04:29:18,730 --> 04:29:19,330
Oh...

5866
04:29:19,950 --> 04:29:21,370
Stone transformed into a crystal...

5867
04:29:21,770 --> 04:29:23,070
The cause is something else.

5868
04:29:24,270 --> 04:29:26,010
Wait, is that that mother stone?

5869
04:29:26,430 --> 04:29:27,610
Yeah, didn't I kill it?

5870
04:29:28,690 --> 04:29:29,570
Oh shit!

5871
04:29:34,030 --> 04:29:34,970
It was alive?

5872
04:29:36,710 --> 04:29:37,230
That's fucking right.

5873
04:29:37,550 --> 04:29:38,570
That's fucking right.

5874
04:29:39,510 --> 04:29:41,310
You think I'm scared of you?

5875
04:29:41,850 --> 04:29:43,290
Fire can burn rock!

5876
04:29:44,670 --> 04:29:46,990
Oh my god, I forgot I already used the baby.

5877
04:29:48,870 --> 04:29:50,290
I don't know what to do.

5878
04:29:52,030 --> 04:29:54,170
I'll just keep burning the rock eventually!

5879
04:29:57,910 --> 04:29:59,070
Stranger danger.

5880
04:29:59,550 --> 04:30:00,110
I fucking knew it.

5881
04:30:00,130 --> 04:30:02,950
I fucking knew it.

5882
04:30:02,950 --> 04:30:03,710
Stranger danger.

5883
04:30:03,990 --> 04:30:05,030
Never trust strangers.

5884
04:30:05,510 --> 04:30:07,050
Every fucking time.

5885
04:30:11,170 --> 04:30:13,090
Every fucking time.

5886
04:30:14,890 --> 04:30:17,990
I thought today would be different.

5887
04:30:20,290 --> 04:30:21,770
It's never different!

5888
04:30:25,210 --> 04:30:25,890
Wait,

5889
04:30:29,490 --> 04:30:29,930
what is this?

5890
04:30:30,010 --> 04:30:30,350
Mimic?

5891
04:30:30,950 --> 04:30:33,290
Wait, did I got like the...

5892
04:30:37,370 --> 04:30:38,530
Imagine Stone.

5893
04:30:40,490 --> 04:30:41,590
Imagine Stone.

5894
04:30:41,810 --> 04:30:43,290
Imagine Stone.

5895
04:30:47,190 --> 04:30:48,150
Imagine Stone.

5896
04:30:48,350 --> 04:30:49,130
Imagine Stone.

5897
04:30:49,370 --> 04:30:49,810
Imagine Stone.

5898
04:30:53,270 --> 04:30:54,750
But what can I use?

5899
04:30:54,810 --> 04:30:56,970
I can't invade other people's lands.

5900
04:30:57,790 --> 04:31:00,770
I can't invade the Wukong multiverse.

5901
04:31:01,290 --> 04:31:04,930
I can't

5902
04:31:09,560 --> 04:31:09,560
invade the Wukong multiverse.

5903
04:31:09,560 --> 04:31:10,320
Where is it anyway?

5904
04:31:11,280 --> 04:31:12,300
This one?

5905
04:31:15,100 --> 04:31:17,480
Oh, he's a wolf transformation.

5906
04:31:20,180 --> 04:31:22,360
Oh, I see.

5907
04:31:22,500 --> 04:31:23,140
Oh, I see.

5908
04:31:23,920 --> 04:31:26,160
How do I change it then?

5909
04:31:28,340 --> 04:31:29,680
Actually, I don't know what to level up.

5910
04:31:29,780 --> 04:31:31,100
I'll grab defense too then.

5911
04:31:33,040 --> 04:31:33,520
Uh...

5912
04:31:36,420 --> 04:31:37,580
Oh, is it the stride?

5913
04:31:37,740 --> 04:31:38,120
Okay.

5914
04:31:42,730 --> 04:31:44,710
I still don't know if I wanna...

5915
04:31:46,090 --> 04:31:49,510
If I wanna use that or...

5916
04:31:53,200 --> 04:31:54,080
What is better?

5917
04:31:54,220 --> 04:31:55,760
The wolf or the rock?

5918
04:31:56,280 --> 04:31:57,840
I don't even know what the rock does.

5919
04:31:58,040 --> 04:31:58,840
I'm not gonna lie.

5920
04:32:02,160 --> 04:32:02,640
Uh...

5921
04:32:03,340 --> 04:32:04,140
A buckle?

5922
04:32:05,940 --> 04:32:07,280
But there's two ups.

5923
04:32:08,760 --> 04:32:09,960
Which is the right...

5924
04:32:09,960 --> 04:32:10,760
Oh, this is chest up.

5925
04:32:19,720 --> 04:32:20,460
Oh, nice.

5926
04:32:20,540 --> 04:32:20,860
So...

5927
04:32:21,380 --> 04:32:22,380
Haha, yoink!

5928
04:32:22,380 --> 04:32:23,020
Took your treasure!

5929
04:32:28,300 --> 04:32:28,780
Okay.

5930
04:32:31,240 --> 04:32:32,400
Oh, I'm not gonna make it.

5931
04:32:33,500 --> 04:32:34,900
Oh god, that's awkward.

5932
04:32:36,180 --> 04:32:36,300
Haha.

5933
04:32:38,860 --> 04:32:39,380
Whoops.

5934
04:32:44,320 --> 04:32:44,960
It's okay.

5935
04:32:47,040 --> 04:32:48,780
I need to recharge my stamina.

5936
04:32:52,100 --> 04:32:53,400
Don't worry, I got this.

5937
04:32:54,680 --> 04:32:55,540
Poke your butt!

5938
04:32:59,800 --> 04:33:00,840
Come on.

5939
04:33:01,000 --> 04:33:03,020
Come on, let me poke your butt one last time!

5940
04:33:03,900 --> 04:33:04,600
Come on!

5941
04:33:05,460 --> 04:33:07,000
Just a simple poke!

5942
04:33:07,360 --> 04:33:09,320
God damn it, your shield is so strong!

5943
04:33:12,680 --> 04:33:13,240
Poke!

5944
04:33:14,200 --> 04:33:14,760
Nice.

5945
04:33:17,360 --> 04:33:18,020
Okay, he's dead.

5946
04:33:20,200 --> 04:33:21,940
Is this where I got the first Buddha?

5947
04:33:22,600 --> 04:33:24,620
Oh yeah, this is the original rock area.

5948
04:33:25,940 --> 04:33:26,500
Oh...

5949
04:33:27,720 --> 04:33:28,600
Is it here?

5950
04:33:30,400 --> 04:33:31,280
What is this?

5951
04:33:31,940 --> 04:33:32,960
Okay, that's nothing.

5952
04:33:35,640 --> 04:33:36,320
Where am I?

5953
04:33:42,430 --> 04:33:44,770
Where am I?

5954
04:33:45,110 --> 04:33:47,610
Where will I ever go?

5955
04:33:53,150 --> 04:33:55,470
Shield user derogatory...

5956
04:33:55,470 --> 04:33:59,510
Oh my god, where did he come from?!

5957
04:34:01,730 --> 04:34:03,070
Oh, to the boss!

5958
04:34:03,270 --> 04:34:03,430
Oh!

5959
04:34:03,430 --> 04:34:03,650
Oh!

5960
04:34:03,650 --> 04:34:05,710
I can go to the... back to the rock?

5961
04:34:07,650 --> 04:34:10,750
To the area where there was like... nothing there?

5962
04:34:11,670 --> 04:34:12,870
That wasn't a boss area.

5963
04:34:13,090 --> 04:34:13,930
What are you talking about?

5964
04:34:18,750 --> 04:34:20,250
Oh, go up those stairs?

5965
04:34:20,550 --> 04:34:20,930
What stairs?

5966
04:34:21,790 --> 04:34:22,450
There were stairs?

5967
04:34:24,210 --> 04:34:24,810
This?

5968
04:34:24,810 --> 04:34:26,670
There's so many stairs.

5969
04:34:28,810 --> 04:34:29,330
Oh!

5970
04:34:45,140 --> 04:34:46,680
What you gonna do?

5971
04:34:46,700 --> 04:34:47,120
Hit me?

5972
04:34:48,820 --> 04:34:50,240
Oh wait, I can't even hit you.

5973
04:34:50,620 --> 04:34:51,140
Ow!

5974
04:34:54,160 --> 04:34:54,680
Please!

5975
04:34:54,680 --> 04:34:56,660
Please stop saying your poetry right now!

5976
04:34:56,860 --> 04:34:58,120
I'm trying to kill a guy!

5977
04:35:04,050 --> 04:35:04,570
Please!

5978
04:35:04,970 --> 04:35:07,090
I can't stop your poetry!

5979
04:35:07,250 --> 04:35:09,150
I have to kill something!

5980
04:35:12,970 --> 04:35:13,310
Hello.

5981
04:35:13,570 --> 04:35:14,010
Oh.

5982
04:35:15,970 --> 04:35:16,650
Hello.

5983
04:35:22,810 --> 04:35:24,170
Oh no.

5984
04:35:24,570 --> 04:35:25,710
Wait a minute.

5985
04:35:25,970 --> 04:35:27,250
He still has his shield.

5986
04:35:28,250 --> 04:35:29,250
Big baby!

5987
04:35:30,510 --> 04:35:31,750
That's fucking right.

5988
04:35:32,430 --> 04:35:34,210
You're nothing without your shield!

5989
04:35:34,790 --> 04:35:37,110
You're nothing without your shield!

5990
04:35:39,070 --> 04:35:39,870
Easy.

5991
04:35:43,230 --> 04:35:44,530
Poetry important.

5992
04:35:45,230 --> 04:35:46,930
He can't lure right now!

5993
04:35:47,370 --> 04:35:49,130
I'm at the line that's busy!

5994
04:35:49,790 --> 04:35:51,730
I'm trying to fucking...

5995
04:35:52,250 --> 04:35:54,830
I'm trying to fucking kill the people!

5996
04:35:58,090 --> 04:35:58,890
Alright.

5997
04:35:59,930 --> 04:36:00,750
Did not go.

5998
04:36:07,060 --> 04:36:08,220
I parted the sand.

5999
04:36:12,870 --> 04:36:14,010
Door open!

6000
04:36:24,280 --> 04:36:25,620
What's in the cave?

6001
04:36:38,500 --> 04:36:39,600
What is this?

6002
04:36:52,990 --> 04:36:54,990
Why is there a cave within the cave?

6003
04:37:02,030 --> 04:37:03,550
Oh no!

6004
04:37:05,670 --> 04:37:06,810
Black loan?

6005
04:37:07,690 --> 04:37:08,830
Black dragon?

6006
04:37:10,450 --> 04:37:11,210
Wait...

6007
04:37:12,470 --> 04:37:13,730
Wait a minute.

6008
04:37:14,470 --> 04:37:17,610
I'm sorry for not listening to your poetry!

6009
04:37:17,610 --> 04:37:17,930
Poetry.

6010
04:37:18,070 --> 04:37:20,870
Oh my god.

6011
04:37:21,530 --> 04:37:25,250
I'm sorry I didn't listen to your poetry.

6012
04:37:25,690 --> 04:37:28,450
It was a very nice poem.

6013
04:37:34,200 --> 04:37:35,140
I'm sorry.

6014
04:37:36,200 --> 04:37:39,680
I'll listen to your poetry next time.

6015
04:37:48,230 --> 04:37:50,070
Oh shit.

6016
04:37:53,310 --> 04:37:54,710
Oh my god.

6017
04:37:58,430 --> 04:38:00,030
Oh the music slaps though.

6018
04:38:00,150 --> 04:38:00,690
Not gonna lie.

6019
04:38:01,890 --> 04:38:04,830
And that's not the only thing that's slapping me.

6020
04:38:07,830 --> 04:38:08,890
Jesus Christ.

6021
04:38:10,270 --> 04:38:11,630
Please I'm sorry.

6022
04:38:15,610 --> 04:38:16,550
Oh god.

6023
04:38:17,950 --> 04:38:18,530
Okay.

6024
04:38:20,690 --> 04:38:21,410
Oh.

6025
04:38:21,590 --> 04:38:23,190
Managed to do electricity too.

6026
04:38:23,270 --> 04:38:23,670
That's good.

6027
04:38:23,830 --> 04:38:24,930
That's so good.

6028
04:38:26,630 --> 04:38:27,890
Oh what?

6029
04:38:28,230 --> 04:38:29,710
We actually have to jump?

6030
04:38:30,150 --> 04:38:32,190
Jumping isn't a botanical now?

6031
04:38:38,120 --> 04:38:39,200
Hey guys.

6032
04:38:39,400 --> 04:38:41,780
Thank god I learned how to jump.

6033
04:38:45,400 --> 04:38:48,560
Thank god I learned how to jump.

6034
04:38:49,640 --> 04:38:50,520
Thank god I learned how to jump.

6035
04:38:50,520 --> 04:38:51,660
Oh my god.

6036
04:38:52,380 --> 04:38:54,740
I can't believe it.

6037
04:38:54,880 --> 04:38:55,460
I can't...

6038
04:38:55,460 --> 04:38:57,860
Can't paint it yet again.

6039
04:38:58,400 --> 04:39:01,360
Why does this keep happening to me?

6040
04:39:04,320 --> 04:39:05,200
Why...

6041
04:39:05,200 --> 04:39:09,240
Why do I keep getting painted into boss fights?

6042
04:39:12,100 --> 04:39:13,840
Oh my god.

6043
04:39:13,900 --> 04:39:15,580
It's never something...

6044
04:39:15,580 --> 04:39:16,440
It's never...

6045
04:39:17,420 --> 04:39:20,260
it's never something happy.

6046
04:39:22,480 --> 04:39:25,160
It's always a boss fight.

6047
04:39:27,460 --> 04:39:28,880
Oh god.

6048
04:39:30,400 --> 04:39:32,620
I thought it'd be treasure.

6049
04:39:34,920 --> 04:39:35,880
I don't know.

6050
04:39:36,900 --> 04:39:39,860
I thought I'd get some cool ass treasure.

6051
04:39:41,460 --> 04:39:43,340
It'd be some new equipment.

6052
04:39:43,340 --> 04:39:44,420
Boom!

6053
04:39:45,180 --> 04:39:49,800
Oh, is he gonna... what's he doing?

6054
04:39:51,620 --> 04:39:52,360
Boom.

6055
04:39:53,140 --> 04:39:53,880
Boom.

6056
04:39:54,260 --> 04:39:54,940
Boom.

6057
04:39:55,320 --> 04:39:56,040
Boom.

6058
04:39:56,100 --> 04:39:56,600
Boom.

6059
04:39:56,700 --> 04:39:57,380
Okay.

6060
04:39:58,120 --> 04:39:58,860
Boom.

6061
04:39:59,340 --> 04:40:00,080
Boom.

6062
04:40:00,280 --> 04:40:00,720
Boom.

6063
04:40:00,880 --> 04:40:00,880
Boom.

6064
04:40:15,910 --> 04:40:17,190
There's a rock?

6065
04:40:17,450 --> 04:40:17,710
Me?

6066
04:40:17,930 --> 04:40:19,730
Oh post, that's what you're right.

6067
04:40:19,970 --> 04:40:21,250
Oh, wait.

6068
04:40:22,330 --> 04:40:23,070
Alright.

6069
04:40:23,710 --> 04:40:24,670
You're right.

6070
04:40:25,670 --> 04:40:27,470
I forgot I have more on stands.

6071
04:40:28,030 --> 04:40:29,510
Wait, I could stand on a rock.

6072
04:40:30,310 --> 04:40:31,790
I could stand on this rock.

6073
04:40:33,970 --> 04:40:34,850
Wait, you're right.

6074
04:40:35,050 --> 04:40:35,590
What the fuck?

6075
04:40:35,610 --> 04:40:37,570
Why am I... I could just...

6076
04:40:41,050 --> 04:40:42,290
Oh, shit.

6077
04:40:42,350 --> 04:40:42,590
No!

6078
04:40:45,010 --> 04:40:45,490
Baby!

6079
04:40:48,890 --> 04:40:49,370
What?

6080
04:40:51,990 --> 04:40:52,470
Poke?

6081
04:40:52,570 --> 04:40:53,350
What the fuck?

6082
04:40:53,870 --> 04:40:54,730
What is this?

6083
04:40:56,230 --> 04:40:56,710
Oh

6084
04:41:03,650 --> 04:41:03,990
my god.

6085
04:41:03,990 --> 04:41:04,610
That's new.

6086
04:41:08,670 --> 04:41:09,350
Yeah.

6087
04:41:09,350 --> 04:41:09,350
Okay.

6088
04:41:09,370 --> 04:41:10,310
That was new.

6089
04:41:13,010 --> 04:41:14,010
Oh god.

6090
04:41:18,260 --> 04:41:20,200
Oh, boom.

6091
04:41:24,690 --> 04:41:25,370
Okay.

6092
04:41:25,430 --> 04:41:26,690
This has to be Rock Tab.

6093
04:41:28,250 --> 04:41:29,090
That's right.

6094
04:41:29,430 --> 04:41:31,470
What you gonna do now?

6095
04:41:31,890 --> 04:41:33,370
I'm on a rock!

6096
04:41:34,270 --> 04:41:37,010
Can't do nothing I'm gonna hydrate too.

6097
04:41:37,650 --> 04:41:38,930
Bum, bumb.

6098
04:41:40,710 --> 04:41:42,070
Bum, bumb!

6099
04:41:45,550 --> 04:41:48,090
I didn't realize there was one more.

6100
04:41:48,350 --> 04:41:50,330
He had one more in him.

6101
04:41:50,550 --> 04:41:53,490
That was very awkward.

6102
04:41:56,610 --> 04:41:57,930
He got me there.

6103
04:41:58,130 --> 04:42:00,450
He actually got me there.

6104
04:42:00,570 --> 04:42:03,730
There was one more secret move.

6105
04:42:04,310 --> 04:42:05,050
Oh, God.

6106
04:42:05,390 --> 04:42:06,570
Oh, God.

6107
04:42:07,250 --> 04:42:08,770
This is not fair.

6108
04:42:09,650 --> 04:42:11,150
No, my rock.

6109
04:42:13,230 --> 04:42:15,310
No, my rock.

6110
04:42:18,470 --> 04:42:22,470
Oh, God.

6111
04:42:22,810 --> 04:42:24,250
No, what am I going to do?

6112
04:42:24,290 --> 04:42:25,130
I don't have my rock.

6113
04:42:29,270 --> 04:42:29,750
Okay.

6114
04:42:29,950 --> 04:42:30,310
All right.

6115
04:42:30,310 --> 04:42:30,850
That was sick.

6116
04:42:31,010 --> 04:42:33,610
That was not intentional, by the way.

6117
04:42:35,130 --> 04:42:36,130
Oh, no.

6118
04:42:39,490 --> 04:42:41,990
That jump was definitely not intentional.

6119
04:42:42,150 --> 04:42:44,410
Intentional did not mean to do that.

6120
04:42:45,510 --> 04:42:46,910
But I'll take it.

6121
04:42:51,260 --> 04:42:51,820
Boom.

6122
04:42:52,420 --> 04:42:52,980
Okay.

6123
04:42:54,460 --> 04:42:55,020
Bye.

6124
04:42:56,460 --> 04:42:57,020
Okay.

6125
04:42:57,460 --> 04:42:58,980
Oh, my God.

6126
04:42:59,060 --> 04:43:00,560
This guy is so difficult.

6127
04:43:01,880 --> 04:43:03,420
I'll do one more hydrate.

6128
04:43:04,840 --> 04:43:06,060
Can I get him this rock?

6129
04:43:10,210 --> 04:43:11,110
Oh, no.

6130
04:43:11,630 --> 04:43:12,190
No.

6131
04:43:17,280 --> 04:43:17,840
Okay.

6132
04:43:17,980 --> 04:43:18,820
I get it now.

6133
04:43:29,260 --> 04:43:29,820
Okay.

6134
04:43:29,820 --> 04:43:30,380
Okay.

6135
04:43:31,060 --> 04:43:31,820
I timed it.

6136
04:43:31,940 --> 04:43:32,700
All right.

6137
04:43:32,720 --> 04:43:33,800
I figured it out.

6138
04:43:36,460 --> 04:43:37,940
I figured it out.

6139
04:43:39,200 --> 04:43:40,660
Oh, my God.

6140
04:43:41,260 --> 04:43:41,820
Wait.

6141
04:43:41,880 --> 04:43:42,340
Wolf out.

6142
04:43:42,460 --> 04:43:42,800
No.

6143
04:43:45,540 --> 04:43:47,180
Oh, I'm dead, though.

6144
04:43:47,320 --> 04:43:48,100
I'm dead.

6145
04:43:48,160 --> 04:43:49,920
I don't have enough heals for this.

6146
04:43:51,260 --> 04:43:51,780
Boop.

6147
04:43:51,780 --> 04:43:52,300
Boop.

6148
04:43:53,020 --> 04:43:53,540
Boop.

6149
04:44:03,230 --> 04:44:03,750
Okay.

6150
04:44:03,750 --> 04:44:04,270
No.

6151
04:44:10,200 --> 04:44:11,680
I couldn't clutch.

6152
04:44:11,700 --> 04:44:12,920
It's time to kick.

6153
04:44:15,620 --> 04:44:18,040
I figured out the rhythm pattern, though.

6154
04:44:18,120 --> 04:44:19,800
I don't need the rock anymore.

6155
04:44:22,420 --> 04:44:23,780
Oh, my God.

6156
04:44:24,080 --> 04:44:26,440
I know how to do the mechanic now.

6157
04:44:26,760 --> 04:44:27,780
Oh, my God.

6158
04:44:29,260 --> 04:44:29,780
Jeez.

6159
04:44:29,840 --> 04:44:30,060
Okay.

6160
04:44:30,120 --> 04:44:30,600
Full focus.

6161
04:44:30,720 --> 04:44:31,120
Full focus.

6162
04:44:31,960 --> 04:44:33,660
We're gonna beat this dragon.

6163
04:44:35,140 --> 04:44:36,760
I love the music, though.

6164
04:44:36,800 --> 04:44:37,780
The music is so sick.

6165
04:44:37,820 --> 04:44:38,440
Holy shit.

6166
04:44:39,420 --> 04:44:39,860
Okay.

6167
04:44:39,860 --> 04:44:40,680
One more swing.

6168
04:44:43,580 --> 04:44:44,280
Big baby.

6169
04:44:45,400 --> 04:44:46,280
And then...

6170
04:44:47,140 --> 04:44:47,580
Boom.

6171
04:44:47,640 --> 04:44:48,000
Okay.

6172
04:44:50,980 --> 04:44:51,600
All right.

6173
04:44:53,920 --> 04:44:54,420
Come on.

6174
04:44:57,040 --> 04:44:57,740
Oh, no.

6175
04:44:57,800 --> 04:44:58,900
This one I don't like.

6176
04:44:58,960 --> 04:45:00,180
I don't like this move.

6177
04:45:01,800 --> 04:45:02,260
Okay.

6178
04:45:02,320 --> 04:45:02,540
Nice.

6179
04:45:02,640 --> 04:45:03,420
I just dodged it.

6180
04:45:03,820 --> 04:45:04,280
Oh.

6181
04:45:08,080 --> 04:45:08,540
Okay.

6182
04:45:11,280 --> 04:45:11,880
That's right.

6183
04:45:12,580 --> 04:45:13,260
Big poke!

6184
04:45:13,420 --> 04:45:15,020
All right.

6185
04:45:15,060 --> 04:45:16,100
I think it's time.

6186
04:45:17,420 --> 04:45:18,180
Is it time?

6187
04:45:21,370 --> 04:45:22,130
Oh, fuck.

6188
04:45:22,190 --> 04:45:22,470
Okay.

6189
04:45:22,970 --> 04:45:23,770
That's not great.

6190
04:45:30,210 --> 04:45:30,670
Okay.

6191
04:45:36,410 --> 04:45:37,050
All right.

6192
04:45:37,090 --> 04:45:37,350
Nice.

6193
04:45:37,350 --> 04:45:38,290
Oh.

6194
04:45:39,470 --> 04:45:41,390
I have to go full focus on that.

6195
04:45:50,020 --> 04:45:50,540
No!

6196
04:45:50,820 --> 04:45:51,340
Okay.

6197
04:45:51,400 --> 04:45:51,660
Nice.

6198
04:45:51,680 --> 04:45:51,860
Okay.

6199
04:45:51,920 --> 04:45:52,520
I dodged it.

6200
04:45:58,690 --> 04:45:59,210
Oh.

6201
04:45:59,950 --> 04:46:00,710
Full focus.

6202
04:46:01,170 --> 04:46:01,690
No!

6203
04:46:05,990 --> 04:46:06,510
Drink.

6204
04:46:06,890 --> 04:46:07,610
Hi, drink!

6205
04:46:14,100 --> 04:46:14,620
Come on.

6206
04:46:16,600 --> 04:46:17,120
No!

6207
04:46:17,320 --> 04:46:17,840
What?

6208
04:46:26,140 --> 04:46:28,020
I've never seen that move before!

6209
04:46:29,260 --> 04:46:30,360
That's fucked!

6210
04:46:35,260 --> 04:46:35,560
Okay.

6211
04:46:37,020 --> 04:46:38,240
Oh, my God.

6212
04:46:38,640 --> 04:46:40,920
I've actually never seen that move before!

6213
04:46:44,100 --> 04:46:45,140
It's not fair.

6214
04:46:47,240 --> 04:46:47,900
He's cheating.

6215
04:47:01,600 --> 04:47:02,200
No!

6216
04:47:02,440 --> 04:47:03,740
I jumped the wrong one.

6217
04:47:10,000 --> 04:47:10,600
Okay.

6218
04:47:13,360 --> 04:47:14,140
Oh, no.

6219
04:47:14,860 --> 04:47:15,320
No!

6220
04:47:15,320 --> 04:47:15,700
Fuck!

6221
04:47:15,780 --> 04:47:18,260
I fucked that up.

6222
04:47:18,960 --> 04:47:20,420
That was the wrong pattern.

6223
04:47:22,060 --> 04:47:22,520
Oh.

6224
04:47:23,760 --> 04:47:26,120
I always forget the pattern sometimes.

6225
04:47:26,860 --> 04:47:27,580
Oh, no.

6226
04:47:27,700 --> 04:47:28,300
No, no, no, no.

6227
04:47:29,660 --> 04:47:31,100
Oh, this is my last heal.

6228
04:47:31,180 --> 04:47:32,220
Oh, that's not my last heal.

6229
04:47:32,240 --> 04:47:32,580
Thank God.

6230
04:47:34,900 --> 04:47:35,360
Okay.

6231
04:47:37,760 --> 04:47:38,220
Okay.

6232
04:47:40,820 --> 04:47:41,280
No!

6233
04:47:41,280 --> 04:47:41,740
What?

6234
04:47:43,820 --> 04:47:44,380
Oh.

6235
04:47:45,700 --> 04:47:50,040
Sometimes I don't know why he does that.

6236
04:47:51,900 --> 04:47:52,460
No.

6237
04:47:52,560 --> 04:47:53,040
Okay.

6238
04:47:54,380 --> 04:47:54,940
Fine!

6239
04:48:03,310 --> 04:48:04,170
Wolf time.

6240
04:48:05,070 --> 04:48:05,630
Wolf.

6241
04:48:05,730 --> 04:48:06,290
Wolf.

6242
04:48:10,000 --> 04:48:11,800
Let me at least have one more wolf!

6243
04:48:19,200 --> 04:48:20,500
I really appreciate it!

6244
04:48:21,140 --> 04:48:22,840
Thank you for letting me have the wolf!

6245
04:48:23,500 --> 04:48:23,980
Oh, no.

6246
04:48:24,340 --> 04:48:24,900
Yes!

6247
04:48:29,180 --> 04:48:30,420
Oh, my God.

6248
04:48:30,420 --> 04:48:31,640
I tried to lock it!

6249
04:48:32,100 --> 04:48:34,100
Oh, my God.

6250
04:48:34,220 --> 04:48:35,340
I had to lock it.

6251
04:48:35,620 --> 04:48:38,880
I actually had to time everything.

6252
04:48:41,600 --> 04:48:43,100
Oh, my God.

6253
04:48:44,660 --> 04:48:45,400
Oh.

6254
04:48:46,120 --> 04:48:48,820
That shit is so...

6255
04:48:49,660 --> 04:48:51,060
Oh, my God.

6256
04:48:51,760 --> 04:48:53,820
This game is so difficult.

6257
04:48:58,480 --> 04:49:01,120
Oh, we did it!

6258
04:49:01,120 --> 04:49:03,420
We got the thunderbolt!

6259
04:49:03,600 --> 04:49:05,940
What the fuck is the thunderbolt?

6260
04:49:07,560 --> 04:49:09,980
We got a pendant too!

6261
04:49:13,760 --> 04:49:15,580
Oh my god.

6262
04:49:18,460 --> 04:49:20,220
That was...

6263
04:49:20,220 --> 04:49:24,120
Oh, that is giving me a victory bark.

6264
04:49:28,320 --> 04:49:34,640
You hear somebody outside, so he's like, Dad is celebrating!

6265
04:49:37,120 --> 04:49:40,180
What the fuck do my items do anyway?

6266
04:49:45,840 --> 04:49:48,140
Oh, I can't believe it.

6267
04:49:48,160 --> 04:49:48,720
He's dead.

6268
04:49:49,540 --> 04:49:50,920
He's fucking dead.

6269
04:49:54,100 --> 04:49:55,300
Oh my god.

6270
04:49:55,300 --> 04:49:56,880
I thought he was a nice guy!

6271
04:49:57,080 --> 04:49:58,200
He was saying poetry!

6272
04:50:01,480 --> 04:50:02,900
The other is staff material?

6273
04:50:03,300 --> 04:50:03,680
Okay.

6274
04:50:03,980 --> 04:50:05,000
When is it equipable?

6275
04:50:05,600 --> 04:50:06,400
Is it these?

6276
04:50:06,680 --> 04:50:07,320
Oh, it's these!

6277
04:50:08,640 --> 04:50:10,360
Reduces cooldown of spells.

6278
04:50:10,520 --> 04:50:11,200
Wait, I like that.

6279
04:50:12,060 --> 04:50:13,000
What do I have?

6280
04:50:13,220 --> 04:50:14,020
I have stamina.

6281
04:50:16,160 --> 04:50:17,120
And increases...

6282
04:50:17,120 --> 04:50:17,300
Ah!

6283
04:50:21,280 --> 04:50:23,480
I feel like critical hit chance is more important.

6284
04:50:27,840 --> 04:50:29,060
I feel like critical hit chance is more important.

6285
04:50:29,060 --> 04:50:30,360
I'm gonna grab the cooldown.

6286
04:50:30,700 --> 04:50:31,620
Yeah, I don't...

6287
04:50:31,620 --> 04:50:35,560
I'll grab the cooldown and the critical hit chan...

6288
04:50:35,560 --> 04:50:36,380
Uh, the hit chance.

6289
04:50:38,560 --> 04:50:39,060
Okay.

6290
04:50:40,980 --> 04:50:42,880
Now I gotta figure out how to get back.

6291
04:50:43,000 --> 04:50:43,580
Oh, there it is.

6292
04:50:43,860 --> 04:50:45,040
Got back, guys.

6293
04:50:46,080 --> 04:50:46,920
Figured it out.

6294
04:50:50,860 --> 04:50:51,360
Alright.

6295
04:50:52,360 --> 04:50:53,360
Buddha time.

6296
04:50:55,480 --> 04:50:56,480
Buddha time.

6297
04:50:56,480 --> 04:50:56,700
Yeah.

6298
04:50:58,300 --> 04:50:59,860
I got the six eyes.

6299
04:51:00,560 --> 04:51:01,660
Now be free.

6300
04:51:11,610 --> 04:51:12,990
Is this good rope?

6301
04:51:13,170 --> 04:51:14,690
Is this good rock?

6302
04:51:16,070 --> 04:51:16,670
Friend?

6303
04:51:16,870 --> 04:51:19,050
Oh, please tell me this is friend.

6304
04:51:19,450 --> 04:51:20,690
Please, please.

6305
04:51:21,430 --> 04:51:22,030
Friend?

6306
04:51:23,950 --> 04:51:25,810
Oh, it's not friend!

6307
04:51:28,010 --> 04:51:28,610
Okay.

6308
04:51:36,060 --> 04:51:38,400
Alright, here we go again!

6309
04:51:38,400 --> 04:51:40,660
Here we go again!

6310
04:51:41,120 --> 04:51:42,700
Here we go again!

6311
04:51:43,500 --> 04:51:43,560
Here we go again!

6312
04:51:43,560 --> 04:51:43,860
Whoa!

6313
04:51:48,160 --> 04:51:49,700
Hello, not friend.

6314
04:51:51,460 --> 04:51:52,960
He's not friend.

6315
04:51:54,260 --> 04:51:56,620
Guys, he was not friend.

6316
04:51:56,960 --> 04:51:58,580
He was not.

6317
04:51:59,340 --> 04:52:00,060
No!

6318
04:52:00,060 --> 04:52:01,240
God, okay.

6319
04:52:01,680 --> 04:52:02,680
Now we know.

6320
04:52:02,940 --> 04:52:04,420
Now we know at least.

6321
04:52:05,180 --> 04:52:07,340
I can't believe it wasn't a friend.

6322
04:52:09,900 --> 04:52:10,400
No!

6323
04:52:10,660 --> 04:52:12,460
I can't get that timing correct.

6324
04:52:14,420 --> 04:52:14,920
Okay.

6325
04:52:14,980 --> 04:52:16,240
Oh my god, he's slamming.

6326
04:52:18,920 --> 04:52:20,340
When will they be friends?

6327
04:52:20,580 --> 04:52:22,140
Why can't we be friends?

6328
04:52:22,480 --> 04:52:23,860
Why can't we be friends?

6329
04:52:24,080 --> 04:52:25,460
Why can't we be friends?

6330
04:52:25,960 --> 04:52:27,020
Why are they all...

6331
04:52:27,020 --> 04:52:27,980
Why do they all hate me?

6332
04:52:28,820 --> 04:52:30,580
I'm not even the real Xu Meng!

6333
04:52:32,620 --> 04:52:34,000
I'm not even him!

6334
04:52:36,500 --> 04:52:37,720
He's in the wrong!

6335
04:52:41,440 --> 04:52:41,960
Okay.

6336
04:52:42,060 --> 04:52:42,340
Okay.

6337
04:52:42,340 --> 04:52:42,800
Nice.

6338
04:52:46,300 --> 04:52:46,820
Oh.

6339
04:52:47,800 --> 04:52:48,560
Oh god.

6340
04:52:49,060 --> 04:52:49,580
Okay.

6341
04:52:52,040 --> 04:52:54,660
You look like him and that's all that.

6342
04:52:54,880 --> 04:52:55,100
You look like him and that's all that.

6343
04:52:55,100 --> 04:52:56,360
That's just cause I'm a monkey!

6344
04:52:57,840 --> 04:52:58,820
That's just cause I'm a monkey!

6345
04:52:58,820 --> 04:53:00,500
Do I say all rocks look like him?

6346
04:53:00,640 --> 04:53:01,780
No, I don't!

6347
04:53:04,220 --> 04:53:06,140
Just cause I'm a monkey?

6348
04:53:06,140 --> 04:53:07,420
That's fucked.

6349
04:53:09,320 --> 04:53:10,200
Okay.

6350
04:53:10,380 --> 04:53:12,100
Oh god, not okay.

6351
04:53:12,720 --> 04:53:15,060
Oh, definitely not okay.

6352
04:53:18,640 --> 04:53:20,460
Oh, come on!

6353
04:53:22,540 --> 04:53:25,160
Just get hit by everything.

6354
04:53:25,600 --> 04:53:27,020
Oh no.

6355
04:53:29,980 --> 04:53:30,860
Okay.

6356
04:53:31,000 --> 04:53:33,080
Are you fucking serious?

6357
04:53:33,120 --> 04:53:33,820
Are you fucking serious?

6358
04:53:43,040 --> 04:53:43,920
Are you fucking serious?

6359
04:53:44,860 --> 04:53:49,080
Oh shit!

6360
04:53:50,340 --> 04:53:50,820
No!

6361
04:53:52,460 --> 04:53:55,280
I can't get the timing correct!

6362
04:53:56,340 --> 04:53:58,040
I can't get the timing correct!

6363
04:53:58,040 --> 04:53:58,940
Oh my god!

6364
04:54:00,280 --> 04:54:03,680
He's like, I don't know his combos!

6365
04:54:07,140 --> 04:54:09,980
Dad's just watching me from outside!

6366
04:54:10,560 --> 04:54:12,920
He's judging me!

6367
04:54:13,360 --> 04:54:14,320
He's...

6368
04:54:14,320 --> 04:54:15,300
He's...

6369
04:54:16,540 --> 04:54:18,780
He's judging me from outside right now!

6370
04:54:20,480 --> 04:54:21,880
He's judging me from outside right now!

6371
04:54:21,880 --> 04:54:22,640
I'm sorry!

6372
04:54:23,960 --> 04:54:24,660
I'm sorry!

6373
04:54:27,500 --> 04:54:30,280
Oh my god, I just gotta...

6374
04:54:30,280 --> 04:54:30,340
Oh my god, I just gotta...

6375
04:54:30,340 --> 04:54:32,660
I have to go find another boss right after!

6376
04:54:33,540 --> 04:54:34,780
Okay, skip.

6377
04:54:36,240 --> 04:54:36,940
Okay, skip.

6378
04:54:36,940 --> 04:54:37,380
Oh...

6379
04:54:40,460 --> 04:54:40,810
Okay.

6380
04:54:41,260 --> 04:54:41,440
Okay.

6381
04:54:42,300 --> 04:54:44,400
Oh no, I forgot to lock it in.

6382
04:54:46,520 --> 04:54:47,000
Oh...

6383
04:54:47,000 --> 04:54:47,240
Oh!

6384
04:54:49,680 --> 04:54:50,160
Okay.

6385
04:54:50,620 --> 04:54:51,100
Freeze.

6386
04:54:54,040 --> 04:54:54,520
Boom!

6387
04:54:54,860 --> 04:54:55,340
Okay.

6388
04:54:55,920 --> 04:54:56,400
Ah!

6389
04:54:57,400 --> 04:54:58,180
God damn it!

6390
04:54:59,360 --> 04:55:01,120
Oh no, this is not good!

6391
04:55:05,040 --> 04:55:06,220
I'm gonna smack that butt!

6392
04:55:06,380 --> 04:55:07,960
Just like how I smacked your mom's butt!

6393
04:55:08,080 --> 04:55:08,700
Oh shit!

6394
04:55:10,260 --> 04:55:10,760
...

6395
04:55:14,820 --> 04:55:16,080
Oh my god.

6396
04:55:16,800 --> 04:55:17,740
Alright, nice, nice.

6397
04:55:17,820 --> 04:55:20,460
He just jumps, so I don't have to worry about that!

6398
04:55:20,700 --> 04:55:21,920
And then smack!

6399
04:55:22,720 --> 04:55:24,300
And I get hit?!

6400
04:55:26,940 --> 04:55:28,240
I see you got...

6401
04:55:28,240 --> 04:55:29,880
I see you got your butt from your mom!

6402
04:55:32,260 --> 04:55:35,960
Okay, we just dodged that.

6403
04:55:36,120 --> 04:55:36,560
No!

6404
04:55:36,720 --> 04:55:38,780
That timing is so weird!

6405
04:55:39,320 --> 04:55:42,620
It's such a weird timing for like the floor!

6406
04:55:43,060 --> 04:55:43,700
It's such a weird timing for like the floor!

6407
04:55:43,700 --> 04:55:44,000
It's such a weird timing for like the floor!

6408
04:55:44,400 --> 04:55:46,140
I could never like figure it out!

6409
04:55:46,360 --> 04:55:46,520
...

6410
04:55:49,140 --> 04:55:49,700
Okay.

6411
04:55:50,840 --> 04:55:51,400
Nice.

6412
04:55:51,660 --> 04:55:52,100
Oh!

6413
04:55:52,440 --> 04:55:54,260
I got the dodge just in time!

6414
04:55:54,280 --> 04:55:55,020
The sky dodge!

6415
04:55:55,460 --> 04:55:56,020
Boom!

6416
04:55:57,500 --> 04:55:59,900
Oh shit, he sat on me!

6417
04:56:00,160 --> 04:56:01,400
Oh my god!

6418
04:56:03,540 --> 04:56:04,620
Come on, come on!

6419
04:56:09,140 --> 04:56:09,700
Smack!

6420
04:56:10,860 --> 04:56:11,920
Okay, and then dodge!

6421
04:56:12,440 --> 04:56:14,800
Okay, I need to redo my stamina!

6422
04:56:16,240 --> 04:56:17,200
I need to redo my stamina!

6423
04:56:17,360 --> 04:56:19,740
I'm not intentionally aiming for the butt!

6424
04:56:19,820 --> 04:56:20,460
It's just there!

6425
04:56:22,400 --> 04:56:24,100
Look, it's not my fault!

6426
04:56:24,180 --> 04:56:25,380
My staff fits the...

6427
04:56:25,380 --> 04:56:27,020
My staff fits it perfectly!

6428
04:56:29,960 --> 04:56:30,940
It's just...

6429
04:56:30,940 --> 04:56:34,120
My staff just fits it perfectly into the instance!

6430
04:56:34,480 --> 04:56:35,160
You know?!

6431
04:56:35,160 --> 04:56:36,060
...

6432
04:56:36,060 --> 04:56:36,540
...

6433
04:56:39,980 --> 04:56:40,620
Nice.

6434
04:56:42,280 --> 04:56:42,880
Oh!

6435
04:56:44,700 --> 04:56:46,440
Now there's definite...

6436
04:56:46,440 --> 04:56:49,500
Now they will never find the ponies for real!

6437
04:56:50,800 --> 04:56:51,400
Now there's definite...

6438
04:56:52,940 --> 04:56:55,260
Oh my god, we did it!

6439
04:56:55,460 --> 04:56:56,560
Was that the side quest?

6440
04:56:57,260 --> 04:56:58,460
What do I do with that?

6441
04:57:01,260 --> 04:57:02,660
Now what do I do with that?

6442
04:57:03,440 --> 04:57:05,520
Whatever you say, Doki!

6443
04:57:05,980 --> 04:57:07,340
Oh, I can grab weapons!

6444
04:57:09,740 --> 04:57:11,280
Wait, does that mean...

6445
04:57:11,980 --> 04:57:12,600

6446
04:57:13,760 --> 04:57:14,380
60...

6447
04:57:15,600 --> 04:57:16,960
Wait, but this is 70!

6448
04:57:18,400 --> 04:57:19,720
Refined Iron Staff.

6449
04:57:19,900 --> 04:57:20,720
Oh, but I don't have enough.

6450
04:57:24,300 --> 04:57:26,260
I guess I have to do this then.

6451
04:57:27,580 --> 04:57:28,200
I guess I have to do this then.

6452
04:57:28,460 --> 04:57:29,080
Alright.

6453
04:57:31,100 --> 04:57:32,680
I guess I'll get that?

6454
04:57:33,080 --> 04:57:33,560
I guess I'll get that?

Modern increase the damage executed by charged smash...

6457
04:57:37,060 --> 04:57:38,580
Charged smash heavy attacks.

6458
04:57:40,200 --> 04:57:40,820
Um...

6459
04:57:45,700 --> 04:57:46,320
Um...

6460
04:57:46,580 --> 04:57:47,120
Um...

6461
04:57:48,300 --> 04:57:48,900
Okay.

6462
04:57:51,160 --> 04:57:52,820
Do I have anything else to craft?

6463
04:57:53,080 --> 04:57:53,540
No, right?

6464
04:57:54,440 --> 04:57:55,040
Okay.

6465
04:57:55,320 --> 04:57:56,520

04:58:18,460 --> 04:58:19,680
No, baby still...

6476
04:58:19,680 --> 04:58:21,380
No, no baby.

Okay, rock fist flat.

6480
04:58:35,680 --> 04:58:37,480
Guys, it's been 5 hours.

6481
04:58:38,060 --> 04:58:38,800
I've been...

6482
04:58:39,460 --> 04:58:40,280
I've been...

6483
04:58:40,280 --> 04:58:43,040
I've been non-stop pause rushing.

6484
04:58:43,480 --> 04:58:44,540
Back to back.

6485
04:58:44,540 --> 04:58:44,920
Back to back.

6486
04:58:46,020 --> 04:58:47,400
Alright, now where do I go?

6487
04:58:49,240 --> 04:58:50,800
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

6488
04:59:04,580 --> 04:59:05,640
Go to the right.

6489
04:59:05,680 --> 04:59:07,260
There's a gap in the rocks.

6490
04:59:07,900 --> 04:59:09,320
There's so many gaps.

6491
04:59:12,440 --> 04:59:13,340
The sage?

6492
04:59:14,140 --> 04:59:15,840
Where was the sage, dude?

6493
04:59:20,470 --> 04:59:22,770
Wait, who the fuck slapped me?

6494
04:59:27,960 --> 04:59:29,220
Oh, behind the shrine.

6495
04:59:29,380 --> 04:59:29,680
Okay.

6496
04:59:33,470 --> 04:59:34,610
Which shrine?

6497
04:59:42,270 --> 04:59:42,790
This one?

6498
04:59:46,170 --> 04:59:47,310
Oh my god, please.

6499
04:59:52,710 --> 04:59:56,290
I couldn't even look at my incense.

6500
04:59:56,430 --> 04:59:58,150
It just fucking slapped me.

6501
04:59:58,610 --> 05:00:00,010
Oh, there he is!

6502
05:00:04,830 --> 05:00:05,750
I've been here?

6503
05:00:06,990 --> 05:00:08,110
I can't remember.

6504
05:00:09,430 --> 05:00:10,270
Hello?

6505
05:00:11,230 --> 05:00:15,850
What the fuck is wrong with you?

6506
05:00:16,290 --> 05:00:22,950
You don't know what you're doing?

6507
05:00:28,860 --> 05:00:31,260
Oh, my god.

6508
05:00:31,520 --> 05:00:35,580
Is everyone still alive?

6509
05:00:36,300 --> 05:00:37,180
Still?

6510
05:00:37,600 --> 05:00:38,260
You got me.

6511
05:00:38,260 --> 05:00:38,420
I thought you were still alive.

6512
05:00:38,460 --> 05:00:39,040
Like you were still alive.

6513
05:00:39,040 --> 05:00:39,520
What?

6514
05:00:40,160 --> 05:00:41,220
What the fuck?

6515
05:00:57,820 --> 05:01:00,520
Wait, this is a different mission.

6516
05:01:04,100 --> 05:01:09,000
This is a di- This is a different mission!

6517
05:01:11,960 --> 05:01:14,840
This is a different side quest!

6518
05:01:16,700 --> 05:01:17,840
Smack his belly?

6519
05:01:18,020 --> 05:01:18,800
Is he gonna hit me?

6520
05:01:22,530 --> 05:01:24,430
No, I just not think I...

6521
05:01:25,970 --> 05:01:26,590
Alright.

6522
05:01:26,790 --> 05:01:27,890
Oh, there's some meditation.

6523
05:01:29,910 --> 05:01:30,850
There's meditation.

6524
05:01:31,490 --> 05:01:32,450
Let's meditate.

6525
05:01:59,220 --> 05:02:00,720
Manual chapter 2.

6526
05:02:13,050 --> 05:02:15,630
I don't like sand.

6527
05:02:16,130 --> 05:02:19,350
I don't like...

6528
05:02:22,430 --> 05:02:23,850
It's just...

6529
05:02:23,850 --> 05:02:25,930
It's too much sand.

6530
05:02:26,490 --> 05:02:29,130
It's just too much...

6531
05:02:29,130 --> 05:02:33,390
I'm not even gonna bother with this guy.

6532
05:02:34,490 --> 05:02:36,790
It's just too much sand.

6533
05:02:36,830 --> 05:02:37,370
It's just too much sand.

6534
05:02:37,390 --> 05:02:39,530
I don't know what to do...

6535
05:02:39,530 --> 05:02:40,810
I don't know what to do...

6536
05:02:40,810 --> 05:02:41,990
with all this sand!

6537
05:02:43,130 --> 05:02:44,470
Why can't I go through this?

6538
05:02:49,410 --> 05:02:52,530
When will the sand end in sand land?

6539
05:02:53,050 --> 05:02:53,970
When will the sand end in sand land?

6540
05:02:53,970 --> 05:02:57,530
When will the sand end in sand land?

6541
05:02:57,530 --> 05:02:59,030
Okay, Tiger Temple.

6542
05:02:59,530 --> 05:02:59,650
Okay, Tiger Temple.

6543
05:03:02,310 --> 05:03:03,810
I like the bosses.

6544
05:03:04,430 --> 05:03:05,810
I'm just so lost.

6545
05:03:06,350 --> 05:03:09,910
I think, like, I definitely like chapter 1's.

6546
05:03:09,930 --> 05:03:09,970
I think, like, I definitely like chapter 1's.

6547
05:03:10,770 --> 05:03:12,570
I don't mind exploration.

6548
05:03:13,330 --> 05:03:14,530
But, like...

6549
05:03:14,530 --> 05:03:16,510
Oh my god!

6550
05:03:16,590 --> 05:03:17,570
Where am I?

6551
05:03:20,490 --> 05:03:23,910
Confucius says chapter 2 ends when chapter 3 begins.

6552
05:03:24,390 --> 05:03:24,450
Confucius says chapter 2 ends when chapter 3 begins.

6553
05:03:24,450 --> 05:03:25,590
Mori, thank you for the super chat!

6554
05:03:25,590 --> 05:03:25,830
Thank you!

6555
05:03:27,850 --> 05:03:29,730
I like chapter 1.

6556
05:03:29,890 --> 05:03:31,330
Chapter 1 had...

6557
05:03:31,330 --> 05:03:32,130
Oh my god!

6558
05:03:33,650 --> 05:03:35,990
Did I go to the wrong place?

6559
05:03:36,370 --> 05:03:37,290
I can't tell!

6560
05:03:37,450 --> 05:03:38,190
Oh, there it is.

6561
05:03:44,530 --> 05:03:45,210
Stop!

6562
05:03:45,910 --> 05:03:46,050
Stop!

6563
05:03:49,470 --> 05:03:50,310
Oh my god!

6564
05:03:50,630 --> 05:03:51,310
Oh my god!

6565
05:03:51,310 --> 05:03:51,510
Oh my god!

6566
05:03:51,510 --> 05:03:52,030
Okay.

6567
05:04:01,480 --> 05:04:03,400
I like chapter 1's map.

6568
05:04:03,540 --> 05:04:04,760
Chapter 2 map...

6569
05:04:05,560 --> 05:04:06,240
I...

6570
05:04:07,080 --> 05:04:08,320
I need a GPS.

6571
05:04:08,920 --> 05:04:11,660
I need a GPS.

6572
05:04:11,980 --> 05:04:12,660
I need a GPS.

6573
05:04:13,220 --> 05:04:14,940
I need a GPS.

6574
05:04:16,260 --> 05:04:17,780
There he goes on the right.

6575
05:04:17,840 --> 05:04:18,540
Oh, there he is!

6576
05:04:21,300 --> 05:04:22,200
There you are!

6577
05:04:33,020 --> 05:04:38,600
There you are!

6578
05:04:38,620 --> 05:04:44,380
Oh, isn't that one that I got already?

6579
05:05:04,660 --> 05:05:06,060
Okay.

6580
05:05:19,280 --> 05:05:20,420
Now we go back.

6581
05:05:21,020 --> 05:05:21,640
Okay.

6582
05:05:22,120 --> 05:05:23,080
Pig, why...

6583
05:05:23,080 --> 05:05:25,000
I finished the mission, Pig!

6584
05:05:25,040 --> 05:05:26,020
Just take my item!

6585
05:05:28,820 --> 05:05:29,440
Just...

6586
05:05:29,440 --> 05:05:31,900
I already finished the mission.

6587
05:05:31,960 --> 05:05:32,960
Just take it!

6588
05:05:33,320 --> 05:05:35,200
As I can take the item!

6589
05:05:38,860 --> 05:05:39,480
Okay.

6590
05:05:41,070 --> 05:05:42,640
Alright, where is it again?

6591
05:05:43,100 --> 05:05:45,520
I forgot where it was again.

6592
05:05:45,580 --> 05:05:46,160
Was it...

6593
05:05:48,800 --> 05:05:49,400
Oh...

6594
05:05:51,300 --> 05:05:52,260
Rockfest flat.

6595
05:05:54,320 --> 05:05:57,420
I'm curious on what he sounds like in English.

6596
05:05:58,840 --> 05:06:02,440
It's not about the item, it's about sending them.

6597
05:06:05,140 --> 05:06:06,700
Alright, what does he sound like?

6598
05:06:06,740 --> 05:06:08,720
I wonder what he sounds like in English actually.

6599
05:06:09,440 --> 05:06:11,060
The English voices are funny.

6600
05:06:13,360 --> 05:06:15,180
Wait, is this the right area?

6601
05:06:16,880 --> 05:06:17,840
Alright, here we go.

6602
05:06:24,590 --> 05:06:26,570
His English voice is pretty goofy.

6603
05:06:26,650 --> 05:06:27,370
Wait, he's not here!

6604
05:06:31,180 --> 05:06:32,240
Wait, where is he?

6605
05:06:35,420 --> 05:06:36,280
Oh shit.

6606
05:06:40,330 --> 05:06:41,110
Oh shit.

6607
05:06:41,350 --> 05:06:42,630
No, he's gonna leave, right?

6608
05:06:44,890 --> 05:06:45,910
Alright, we'll see.

6609
05:06:46,130 --> 05:06:48,410
I wanna see what his English voice lines are.

6610
05:06:52,250 --> 05:06:52,730
Confirm.

6611
05:06:53,910 --> 05:06:56,190
I like how you can swap very easily though.

6612
05:06:56,830 --> 05:06:57,890
Is it to the right?

6613
05:07:12,350 --> 05:07:12,910
Huh?

6614
05:07:15,830 --> 05:07:17,230
Did I not feed him?

6615
05:07:20,450 --> 05:07:21,350
Did I not?

6616
05:07:27,890 --> 05:07:28,450
Fucker!

6617
05:07:29,390 --> 05:07:31,550
Oh my... you fucker.

6618
05:07:31,670 --> 05:07:33,550
You actual fucker.

6619
05:07:33,990 --> 05:07:37,870
How was I supposed to know he was done talking?

6620
05:07:38,470 --> 05:07:39,030
Like...

6621
05:07:43,450 --> 05:07:45,910
Oh my god.

6622
05:07:47,970 --> 05:07:50,150
I didn't know he wasn't done.

6623
05:07:50,330 --> 05:07:51,990
I talked to him twice.

6624
05:07:52,850 --> 05:07:55,610
And then he wants to talk a third time.

6625
05:07:58,650 --> 05:07:59,410
Okay.

6626
05:08:00,630 --> 05:08:01,910
Jesus Christ.

6627
05:08:02,170 --> 05:08:03,550
He's so demanding.

6628
05:08:06,570 --> 05:08:09,130
He just wanted a friend.

6629
05:08:17,810 --> 05:08:19,450
He's a talkative guy.

6630
05:08:22,310 --> 05:08:24,190
Alright, we're gonna be able to hear him.

6631
05:08:27,870 --> 05:08:30,770
I just tried those rat guays.

6632
05:08:31,290 --> 05:08:33,370
They taste like men flesh.

6633
05:08:35,190 --> 05:08:37,570
It's people are not yet extinct.

6634
05:08:38,390 --> 05:08:43,210
I suspect the yellow wind guay had a role in that downfall.

6635
05:08:43,350 --> 05:08:46,710
Our senior brother gave me a piece of gold.

6636
05:08:47,250 --> 05:08:49,590
I'll need it here when the time is right.

6637
05:08:49,610 --> 05:08:50,590
Oh damn, he's bilingual?

6638
05:08:52,330 --> 05:08:53,930
It's the right time now.

6639
05:08:54,670 --> 05:08:56,690
I'm taking it to the right place.

6640
05:08:56,830 --> 05:08:57,950
Why are they always British?

6641
05:08:58,270 --> 05:08:59,470
Is he also from Hong Kong?

6642
05:09:01,010 --> 05:09:03,570
I just tried those rat guays.

6643
05:09:03,870 --> 05:09:04,350
Okay.

6644
05:09:05,450 --> 05:09:07,350
He's the Hong Kong pig.

6645
05:09:11,070 --> 05:09:11,410
Alright.

6646
05:09:12,470 --> 05:09:14,490
Now we go back.

6647
05:09:18,100 --> 05:09:18,780
Alright.

6648
05:09:19,860 --> 05:09:20,620
We did it.

6649
05:09:23,280 --> 05:09:26,520
He learned another language while waiting for me.

6650
05:09:35,040 --> 05:09:36,160
Alright, here we go.

6651
05:09:38,520 --> 05:09:41,520
I don't know what language to play in.

6652
05:09:41,640 --> 05:09:45,260
I feel like both has its merits.

6653
05:09:47,320 --> 05:09:50,460
I guess Chinese for the immersion and stuff.

6654
05:09:52,200 --> 05:09:58,440
To be fair, a lot of what they're saying is very lore slash poetry heavy.

6655
05:09:58,880 --> 05:10:00,340
So it's like...

6656
05:10:00,340 --> 05:10:02,860
Where did you acquire my brother's gold piece?

6657
05:10:03,040 --> 05:10:04,540
Oh wait, you're not...

6658
05:10:04,540 --> 05:10:05,560
Oh shit!

6659
05:10:05,560 --> 05:10:06,500
Uh, pause!

6660
05:10:11,520 --> 05:10:13,560
Yeah, alright, I'll put it back in Chinese.

6661
05:10:14,400 --> 05:10:18,780
I feel like dialogue-wise, it doesn't really matter that much.

6662
05:10:18,880 --> 05:10:19,720
Dialogue-wise.

6663
05:10:20,020 --> 05:10:21,380
Because it's all very like...

6664
05:10:21,380 --> 05:10:23,520
There's like poetry and lore and everything.

6665
05:10:24,040 --> 05:10:26,080
So even when you're listening to it, you're like...

6666
05:10:26,080 --> 05:10:27,360
In English, it's like...

6667
05:10:27,360 --> 05:10:29,080
There's just rumbling some poetry.

6668
05:10:29,940 --> 05:10:30,500
Okay.

6669
05:10:36,120 --> 05:10:36,680
Nice.

6670
05:10:38,520 --> 05:10:39,160
Alright.

6671
05:10:40,480 --> 05:10:41,500
Oh shit.

6672
05:10:43,720 --> 05:10:44,360
Nice.

6673
05:10:47,440 --> 05:10:48,080
Alright.

6674
05:10:48,220 --> 05:10:48,820
I do...

6675
05:10:48,820 --> 05:10:51,400
I think that Chinese is definitely better voice acted.

6676
05:10:51,780 --> 05:10:52,420
100%.

6677
05:10:52,420 --> 05:10:54,040
I feel like.

6678
05:10:54,260 --> 05:10:55,440
Like in general.

6679
05:10:55,520 --> 05:10:55,800
Overall.

6680
05:10:56,620 --> 05:10:58,520
Because the dialogue was definitely...

6681
05:10:58,520 --> 05:11:00,940
Like, you know, the dialogue was heavily written for...

6682
05:11:00,940 --> 05:11:01,320
Ah!

6683
05:11:04,060 --> 05:11:04,700
Okay.

6684
05:11:06,800 --> 05:11:07,780
Oh, please.

6685
05:11:07,800 --> 05:11:07,960
Okay.

6686
05:11:07,960 --> 05:11:09,140
Oh, please.

6687
05:11:09,200 --> 05:11:09,660
Oh, please.

6688
05:11:11,120 --> 05:11:12,840
Yeah, I definitely like the immersion.

6689
05:11:13,180 --> 05:11:14,000
Uh, the...

6690
05:11:14,000 --> 05:11:15,200
I like the voice acting.

6691
05:11:15,360 --> 05:11:21,100
Like overall, I do like the voice acting for the Chinese dialogue more than the English dub.

6692
05:11:21,940 --> 05:11:22,540
Come on.

6693
05:11:22,640 --> 05:11:23,000
Poke!

6694
05:11:23,740 --> 05:11:24,040
Poke!

6695
05:11:24,820 --> 05:11:25,500
That's all?

6696
05:11:29,950 --> 05:11:30,550
Poke!

6697
05:11:31,430 --> 05:11:32,010
Okay.

6698
05:11:34,450 --> 05:11:35,050
Damn.

6699
05:11:35,230 --> 05:11:35,870
That's right.

6700
05:11:36,410 --> 05:11:37,010
Poke!

6701
05:11:37,230 --> 05:11:37,970
Double poke!

6702
05:11:39,330 --> 05:11:39,770
Freeze!

6703
05:11:40,510 --> 05:11:42,010
And you should be dead.

6704
05:11:44,790 --> 05:11:45,910
Give me that gold!

6705
05:11:47,730 --> 05:11:49,810
Yeah, it's definitely a lot more immersive in Chinese.

6706
05:11:54,450 --> 05:11:59,330
Do I have to go inside now?

6707
05:12:04,660 --> 05:12:09,060
He opened the door just a little bit more so now I can fit!

6708
05:12:12,400 --> 05:12:13,760
Them tiny subs!

6709
05:12:14,140 --> 05:12:14,860
Oh my...

6710
05:12:14,860 --> 05:12:18,860
Guys, I even made the subtitles bigger for this!

6711
05:12:22,160 --> 05:12:23,920
Oh, but this is still...

6712
05:12:24,860 --> 05:12:26,460
This is still better though.

6713
05:12:27,520 --> 05:12:28,820
Yeah, I'm gonna keep this.

6714
05:12:29,280 --> 05:12:30,480
It's better still.

6715
05:12:31,820 --> 05:12:33,040
Oh my god.

6716
05:12:35,060 --> 05:12:36,480
Oh my god.

6717
05:12:36,600 --> 05:12:37,280
This is...

6718
05:12:37,280 --> 05:12:38,440
Finally...

6719
05:12:39,900 --> 05:12:41,680
I'm sorry, dad!

6720
05:12:41,700 --> 05:12:42,180
I'm sorry, dad!

6721
05:12:42,200 --> 05:12:43,380
Please!

6722
05:12:43,620 --> 05:12:44,440
Please!

6723
05:12:45,220 --> 05:12:45,600
Please!

6724
05:12:45,600 --> 05:12:46,160
I'm sorry!

6725
05:12:46,460 --> 05:12:48,480
Chapter two will end soon!

6726
05:12:49,060 --> 05:12:50,320
I promise!

6727
05:13:01,440 --> 05:13:02,760
What's going on?

6728
05:13:04,000 --> 05:13:04,840
Oh!

6729
05:13:04,880 --> 05:13:05,720
I'm sorry!

6730
05:13:05,900 --> 05:13:06,280
The phone was off!

6731
05:13:06,980 --> 05:13:08,200
The phone...

6732
05:13:08,200 --> 05:13:08,800
The phone was off!

6733
05:13:10,820 --> 05:13:12,500
I'm sorry!

6734
05:13:13,240 --> 05:13:14,080
Please!

6735
05:13:14,080 --> 05:13:14,160
Where is Kang?

6736
05:13:57,300 --> 05:14:00,080
I let him in!

6737
05:14:02,020 --> 05:14:04,480
Please, I'm trying to get immersed!

6738
05:14:17,200 --> 05:14:18,580
He's inside now.

6739
05:14:20,080 --> 05:14:23,060
He wants to see the end of chapter two.

6740
05:14:56,420 --> 05:14:57,020
What?

6741
05:15:07,850 --> 05:15:09,650
Why does everyone think I'm him?

6742
05:15:10,370 --> 05:15:11,950
I'm not even actually him.

6743
05:15:12,070 --> 05:15:13,150
I just look like him.

6744
05:15:15,130 --> 05:15:17,710
He put on the Chinese subtitles.

6745
05:15:19,050 --> 05:15:19,650
Guys...

6746
05:15:25,910 --> 05:15:27,590
Why are you barking here?

6747
05:15:35,130 --> 05:15:36,630
Alright, incense time.

6748
05:15:36,730 --> 05:15:38,690
I swear to god, is this...

6749
05:15:43,800 --> 05:15:45,360
It's always Wooka.

6750
05:15:45,440 --> 05:15:46,980
It's always his fault.

6751
05:15:48,380 --> 05:15:52,760
I might be trying to bring him back, but is that too much to ask for?

6752
05:15:55,220 --> 05:15:58,080
You guys should have expected him to be brought back.

6753
05:16:01,240 --> 05:16:01,780
Who's that?

6754
05:16:06,320 --> 05:16:07,280
New area?

6755
05:16:08,860 --> 05:16:12,720
Alright guys, we're going to look at... I need to walk... I need to walk him.

6756
05:16:13,720 --> 05:16:15,440
I'll be right back.

6757
05:16:20,280 --> 05:16:21,740
Alright, you're going to listen to him.

6758
05:16:21,960 --> 05:16:23,880
I'm going to walk dad.

6759
05:16:24,320 --> 05:16:28,060
If this is a new area, I'll be back.

6760
05:16:28,060 --> 05:16:29,740
I'll be back in five minutes, guys.

6761
05:16:31,480 --> 05:16:32,700
We're going to listen.

6762
05:16:33,600 --> 05:16:36,780
I thought we... I thought it was going to be...

6763
05:16:39,000 --> 05:16:41,140
Walking... my dog.

6764
05:16:41,180 --> 05:16:42,900
Be right back.

6765
05:16:44,660 --> 05:16:45,940
I can't...

6766
05:16:47,020 --> 05:16:48,380
I'm going to be right back.

6767
05:16:48,440 --> 05:16:51,120
I don't know how much longer this is.

6768
05:16:51,380 --> 05:16:53,260
I'm going to go walk him.

6769
05:16:53,460 --> 05:16:54,540
I'll be right back.

6770
05:17:33,160 --> 05:17:34,260
🎶 🎶 🎶

6771
05:18:01,230 --> 05:18:04,090
🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶

6772
05:19:04,200 --> 05:19:05,960
A little

6773
05:19:26,810 --> 05:19:36,730
pause...

6774
05:19:36,730 --> 05:19:37,290
and we are back.

6775
05:21:31,080 --> 05:21:32,060
A little pause... and we are back.

6776
05:23:00,610 --> 05:23:02,130
A little pause... and we are back.

6777
05:24:03,250 --> 05:24:06,050
A little

6778
05:24:26,810 --> 05:24:34,730
pause...

6779
05:24:34,730 --> 05:24:35,290
and we are back.

6780
05:24:35,310 --> 05:24:35,850
A

6781
05:24:56,420 --> 05:26:07,580
little pause... and we are back.

6782
05:28:00,230 --> 05:28:04,010
A little pause... and we are back.

6783
05:28:37,230 --> 05:28:38,630
A

6784
05:28:59,960 --> 05:29:15,820
little pause...

6785
05:29:36,970 --> 05:29:37,790
and we are back.

6786
05:30:31,780 --> 05:30:34,240
Are you guys okay?

6787
05:30:37,340 --> 05:30:40,440
Did you not enjoy the dialogue?

6788
05:30:43,960 --> 05:30:46,620
Are you guys okay?

6789
05:30:47,180 --> 05:30:48,700
Are you guys okay?

6790
05:30:48,700 --> 05:30:48,820
Over there.

6791
05:30:53,120 --> 05:30:54,460
Oh my god.

6792
05:30:55,120 --> 05:30:56,020
I'm back.

6793
05:30:56,740 --> 05:30:58,060
He's been a little shit.

6794
05:30:58,700 --> 05:31:01,400
So we bumped into another wiener dog.

6795
05:31:02,880 --> 05:31:05,600
So we bumped into another wiener dog, yeah.

6796
05:31:06,460 --> 05:31:10,020
And the thing is, he's been like super...

6797
05:31:10,020 --> 05:31:14,340
He's been like super territorial because we're at a new place.

6798
05:31:14,660 --> 05:31:17,960
So he's been more territorial than usual when he's leashed.

6799
05:31:18,120 --> 05:31:18,900
When he's leashed.

6800
05:31:19,500 --> 05:31:20,820
And then so...

6801
05:31:21,760 --> 05:31:23,380
There's a baby wiener dog.

6802
05:31:23,660 --> 05:31:25,380
There's like a baby wiener dog.

6803
05:31:25,700 --> 05:31:27,840
And the baby wiener dog...

6804
05:31:27,840 --> 05:31:28,580
Like we were at the lot.

6805
05:31:28,660 --> 05:31:31,340
The baby wiener dog does not know like what the fuck is going on.

6806
05:31:31,480 --> 05:31:33,280
Because he's still learning because he's a baby.

6807
05:31:33,680 --> 05:31:40,780
And so like the baby wiener dog like walked up to dad.

6808
05:31:41,360 --> 05:31:43,820
And you know, he's so happy because he's like...

6809
05:31:43,820 --> 05:31:46,780
Same, same, same, same dog, same dog.

6810
05:31:47,160 --> 05:31:49,220
And then dad was like...

6811
05:31:49,220 --> 05:31:50,940
Dad was like...

6812
05:31:54,360 --> 05:31:56,520
I was like, holy fuck.

6813
05:32:00,160 --> 05:32:02,800
He like tried to like run up to him.

6814
05:32:02,900 --> 05:32:04,660
He's like, get back up.

6815
05:32:12,430 --> 05:32:16,850
And then like...

6816
05:32:17,790 --> 05:32:22,310
The thing is, the smaller wiener dog, because he's a baby.

6817
05:32:22,410 --> 05:32:22,810
He's like...

6818
05:32:22,810 --> 05:32:23,530
Like basically...

6819
05:32:23,530 --> 05:32:25,610
Like basically one third dad's size.

6820
05:32:25,990 --> 05:32:28,470
And so he was like, is this how we play?

6821
05:32:28,770 --> 05:32:29,530
And then he...

6822
05:32:29,530 --> 05:32:31,670
So I was like pulling dad away.

6823
05:32:32,010 --> 05:32:33,850
I was pulling dad away.

6824
05:32:34,090 --> 05:32:35,630
It was like, no, no.

6825
05:32:36,930 --> 05:32:39,130
And then the baby wiener dog...

6826
05:32:39,890 --> 05:32:42,450
Tried to run back to my dog.

6827
05:32:43,110 --> 05:32:45,230
Because he thought it was play.

6828
05:32:46,630 --> 05:32:47,710
He thought...

6829
05:32:47,710 --> 05:32:49,590
He thought it was play.

6830
05:32:49,850 --> 05:32:51,810
He's like, is this how dogs play?

6831
05:32:52,190 --> 05:32:53,430
And he tried to...

6832
05:32:53,530 --> 05:32:55,290
And he was so happy too.

6833
05:32:55,410 --> 05:32:57,230
He was so fucking happy.

6834
05:32:57,750 --> 05:32:59,530
I was like, please no.

6835
05:32:59,630 --> 05:33:00,350
Don't get close.

6836
05:33:00,610 --> 05:33:02,070
I'll be like, I'm so sorry.

6837
05:33:03,970 --> 05:33:05,430
Oh my god.

6838
05:33:06,590 --> 05:33:08,010
I think it's because he's like...

6839
05:33:08,010 --> 05:33:10,190
He's still adjusting to his new environment.

6840
05:33:10,390 --> 05:33:11,370
So he's like not...

6841
05:33:11,370 --> 05:33:14,030
He's like so territorial with people.

6842
05:33:14,110 --> 05:33:15,590
Like with other dogs right now.

6843
05:33:15,890 --> 05:33:17,210
He's not like that before.

6844
05:33:17,350 --> 05:33:18,890
He's just like in the new environment.

6845
05:33:19,110 --> 05:33:19,850
When he's leashed.

6846
05:33:19,930 --> 05:33:21,390
It's only when he's leashed too.

6847
05:33:21,910 --> 05:33:22,350
Um.

6848
05:33:23,530 --> 05:33:24,850
Alright, here we go.

6849
05:33:24,950 --> 05:33:25,430
Is that dad?

6850
05:33:31,710 --> 05:33:32,710
Tiger Vanguard.

6851
05:33:33,010 --> 05:33:34,590
Am I gonna kill the dad?

6852
05:33:36,370 --> 05:33:36,970
Whoa.

6853
05:33:37,430 --> 05:33:38,030
Whoa.

6854
05:33:38,910 --> 05:33:39,510
Whoa.

6855
05:33:39,570 --> 05:33:40,870
What are my friends?

6856
05:33:44,450 --> 05:33:45,230
Who's this?

6857
05:33:45,390 --> 05:33:46,990
Is this Tony the Tiger's dad?

6858
05:33:47,670 --> 05:33:49,110
Who's dad is this?

6859
05:33:50,110 --> 05:33:51,310
New dialogue.

6860
05:33:51,310 --> 05:33:53,830
What is this new dialogue?

6861
05:33:53,950 --> 05:33:54,590
Oh yeah, you guys...

6862
05:33:54,590 --> 05:33:56,710
You guys are not used to that, are you?

6863
05:33:59,210 --> 05:34:00,170
You're like, wait.

6864
05:34:01,190 --> 05:34:02,990
I killed so many tigers.

6865
05:34:03,130 --> 05:34:04,530
I don't know which one this is.

6866
05:34:05,210 --> 05:34:06,470
Which tiger is this?

6867
05:34:09,330 --> 05:34:09,810
Jesus.

6868
05:34:11,750 --> 05:34:14,290
The frames is crazy though.

6869
05:34:15,390 --> 05:34:15,870
Like...

6870
05:34:16,950 --> 05:34:17,430
Oh.

6871
05:34:18,050 --> 05:34:18,530
Fuck.

6872
05:34:19,650 --> 05:34:20,270
Oh god.

6873
05:34:20,610 --> 05:34:21,290
Oh god.

6874
05:34:21,310 --> 05:34:22,630
Oh god.

6875
05:34:22,770 --> 05:34:23,470
Oh okay.

6876
05:34:24,830 --> 05:34:25,510
Oookay.

6877
05:34:25,950 --> 05:34:27,510
Settle down sir.

6878
05:34:28,170 --> 05:34:29,470
Settle down.

6879
05:34:30,310 --> 05:34:31,190
Oh my god.

6880
05:34:31,230 --> 05:34:33,350
His rapping is so long.

6881
05:34:34,410 --> 05:34:35,270
Oh god.

6882
05:34:35,810 --> 05:34:36,410
Oh god.

6883
05:34:36,610 --> 05:34:37,090
I can't.

6884
05:34:37,350 --> 05:34:38,030
Please.

6885
05:34:39,550 --> 05:34:40,230
What?

6886
05:34:41,470 --> 05:34:42,150
Oh.

6887
05:34:42,450 --> 05:34:43,490
That was scary.

6888
05:34:46,710 --> 05:34:48,910
No, he dodges that?

6889
05:35:00,850 --> 05:35:02,730
I didn't mean that, sir.

6890
05:35:02,990 --> 05:35:05,210
I didn't mean that, sir.

6891
05:35:05,430 --> 05:35:06,710
I was just joking.

6892
05:35:10,080 --> 05:35:10,410
Okay.

6893
05:35:11,030 --> 05:35:11,690
What?

6894
05:35:14,470 --> 05:35:17,270
Bro, he's so... What are these combos?

6895
05:35:22,320 --> 05:35:22,840
Oh my god.

6896
05:35:23,020 --> 05:35:24,320
What are these combos?

6897
05:35:25,640 --> 05:35:29,460
Oh my god, I don't have anything that's with it yet.

6898
05:35:31,100 --> 05:35:33,680
What are these fucking combos?

6899
05:35:34,520 --> 05:35:40,940
Also, I just noticed when I came back that my mic was a little lower than usual in the middle of this.

6900
05:35:41,140 --> 05:35:42,940
I hope that wasn't that noticeable.

6901
05:35:50,360 --> 05:35:53,240
I raised it back up to my usual audio.

6902
05:35:53,920 --> 05:35:54,440
Now?

6903
05:35:54,700 --> 05:35:55,300
Okay, that's good.

6904
05:35:55,320 --> 05:35:55,720
Good to know.

6905
05:35:58,820 --> 05:35:59,780
Oh god.

6906
05:36:01,260 --> 05:36:01,740
Here we go.

6907
05:36:06,340 --> 05:36:07,660
Is clone strong?

6908
05:36:08,200 --> 05:36:14,520
I can't... I normally don't use clones anymore because like everyone was telling me that it was like a waste.

6909
05:36:17,080 --> 05:36:18,100
I can't tell.

6910
05:36:18,500 --> 05:36:22,140
Everyone was like, oh yeah, it's better not to use your clones because it uses too much magic.

6911
05:36:22,620 --> 05:36:23,500
But I don't know.

6912
05:36:26,760 --> 05:36:29,480
I can't upgrade the... oh I should... wait, what the fuck?

6913
05:36:29,540 --> 05:36:29,940
I forgot.

6914
05:36:30,140 --> 05:36:31,880
I have to upgrade other stuff.

6915
05:36:35,720 --> 05:36:40,120
Guys, I forgot that like magic can be upgraded too.

6916
05:36:43,240 --> 05:36:44,660
Guys, did you guys know that?

6917
05:36:45,500 --> 05:36:47,280
That magic is awesome.

6918
05:36:47,520 --> 05:36:47,800
Wow!

6919
05:36:50,300 --> 05:36:52,600
I almost forgot about the magic upgrades.

6920
05:36:53,600 --> 05:36:54,440
Okay, nice.

6921
05:37:05,240 --> 05:37:06,780
Okay, oh god.

6922
05:37:08,220 --> 05:37:10,620
Okay, that's fine, that's fine.

6923
05:37:11,120 --> 05:37:11,980
That's fine!

6924
05:37:12,020 --> 05:37:12,880
Got you in the back!

6925
05:37:14,460 --> 05:37:15,300
Good combat!

6926
05:37:17,700 --> 05:37:19,680
I just realised I never upgraded my skills.

6927
05:37:25,730 --> 05:37:31,310
наком with me 公公

6928
05:37:35,910 --> 05:37:36,570
What?

6929
05:37:40,960 --> 05:37:42,300
Are we friends now?

6930
05:37:43,680 --> 05:37:44,720
Are we friends?

6931
05:37:53,940 --> 05:37:59,980
Oh, we're friends now.

6932
05:38:01,440 --> 05:38:02,100
Okay.

6933
05:38:05,000 --> 05:38:07,120
Wait, why can't you join me?

6934
05:38:08,280 --> 05:38:10,780
Check humanity, return to pocket.

6935
05:38:11,020 --> 05:38:12,980
Thank you Super Chat, thank you, thank you!

6936
05:38:13,380 --> 05:38:15,280
Wait, is this the original Tony the Tiger?

6937
05:38:18,900 --> 05:38:21,860
Wait, is he the original before he went crazy?

6938
05:38:28,490 --> 05:38:29,090
Who is?

6939
05:38:29,270 --> 05:38:29,490
Oh!

6940
05:38:31,170 --> 05:38:32,430
Oh, he's the dad!

6941
05:38:34,090 --> 05:38:36,350
Bro, you have some crazy ass children.

6942
05:38:37,190 --> 05:38:38,070
Both of them!

6943
05:38:38,110 --> 05:38:39,670
What the fuck did you... Are you a bad dad?

6944
05:38:40,550 --> 05:38:42,010
Are you a bad dad?

6945
05:38:43,770 --> 05:38:45,170
Why are your kids crazy?

6946
05:38:54,190 --> 05:38:56,690
Why the fuck are you... What did you do to them?

6947
05:38:58,130 --> 05:39:00,310
Okay, we gotta grab the incense real fast.

6948
05:39:01,470 --> 05:39:03,630
What the fuck did he do to his kids?

6949
05:39:03,670 --> 05:39:05,350
To like, raise them up like that?

6950
05:39:10,480 --> 05:39:10,980
Alright.

6951
05:39:12,580 --> 05:39:13,080
Boop.

6952
05:39:15,420 --> 05:39:16,820
Alright, we gotta rest up.

6953
05:39:17,060 --> 05:39:18,060
We need to recharge.

6954
05:39:18,900 --> 05:39:20,940
This... Is this the longest chapter?

6955
05:39:23,040 --> 05:39:24,580
Out of all of it?

6956
05:39:26,440 --> 05:39:28,100
Let's see, make medicine store.

6957
05:39:28,260 --> 05:39:29,160
Okay, we gotta...

6958
05:39:29,160 --> 05:39:30,900
I think we have enough for skills.

6959
05:39:33,180 --> 05:39:33,700
Okay.

6960
05:39:34,720 --> 05:39:35,680
There you go, strand.

6961
05:39:39,450 --> 05:39:40,770
Okay, we need the damage.

6962
05:39:41,450 --> 05:39:42,890
And we definitely need this.

6963
05:39:45,210 --> 05:39:46,250
After using...

6964
05:39:46,250 --> 05:39:48,370
Hitting enemy's mana extends the dupe...

6965
05:39:48,370 --> 05:39:50,670
After using... Hitting enemy's mana extends the...

6966
05:39:50,670 --> 05:39:50,830
Oh!

6967
05:39:51,150 --> 05:39:52,670
Wait, that's so good!

6968
05:39:52,670 --> 05:39:52,890
Oh!

6969
05:39:52,890 --> 05:39:53,230
Wait, that's so good!

6970
05:39:55,010 --> 05:39:55,530
Alright.

6971
05:39:56,330 --> 05:39:58,010
Okay, we gotta get that then.

6972
05:39:58,190 --> 05:40:00,130
Okay, alterations, cloud step.

6973
05:40:00,510 --> 05:40:00,670
Okay, alterations, cloud step.

6974
05:40:01,410 --> 05:40:01,930
Ahhhh...

6975
05:40:01,930 --> 05:40:03,590
Do we need any of the...

6976
05:40:03,590 --> 05:40:04,150
Do we need any of the...

6977
05:40:04,150 --> 05:40:04,710
Immobilized?

6978
05:40:04,890 --> 05:40:05,850
Recover some mana to pop?

6979
05:40:05,930 --> 05:40:07,770
Wait, it recovers mana!

6980
05:40:13,100 --> 05:40:14,940
It's one of the shortest...

6981
05:40:14,940 --> 05:40:17,040
Oh, I'm doing the side quest...

6982
05:40:17,040 --> 05:40:17,580
Oh, I'm doing the side quest...

6983
05:40:19,360 --> 05:40:21,340
So, it says it's one of the shortest.

6984
05:40:21,540 --> 05:40:22,160
I have just...

6985
05:40:22,160 --> 05:40:23,420
No way.

6986
05:40:23,720 --> 05:40:23,900
No way.

6987
05:40:23,900 --> 05:40:24,820
No way.

6988
05:40:25,620 --> 05:40:26,780
There's no way.

6989
05:40:27,000 --> 05:40:29,700
There's no way this is what the story is.

6990
05:40:30,060 --> 05:40:33,180
I don't... I'm in a new area.

6991
05:40:37,000 --> 05:40:38,460
Oh my god.

6992
05:40:41,780 --> 05:40:43,040
Okay, there's a chest.

6993
05:40:47,850 --> 05:40:50,350
Alright, we got not a voidness.

6994
05:40:52,950 --> 05:40:57,830
And we got a golden... oh, that open area does not look very promising.

6995
05:40:59,970 --> 05:41:01,990
This is also an open area.

6996
05:41:02,470 --> 05:41:03,710
Why is there...

6997
05:41:04,630 --> 05:41:07,130
Why is there so many open areas?

6998
05:41:07,610 --> 05:41:09,460
Why is there so...

6999
05:41:10,230 --> 05:41:12,150
Okay, this chest is open.

7000
05:41:12,810 --> 05:41:14,650
Where is this heading to?

7001
05:41:17,890 --> 05:41:19,910
Where are we heading to?

7002
05:41:20,030 --> 05:41:20,930
Oh, meditating.

7003
05:41:21,230 --> 05:41:21,630
Okay.

7004
05:41:22,030 --> 05:41:22,730
Alright.

7005
05:41:32,820 --> 05:41:35,320
Will we ever finish chapter 2?

7006
05:41:36,540 --> 05:41:38,300
It's been 50 years.

7007
05:41:39,300 --> 05:41:40,940
But yet we're still here.

7008
05:41:43,920 --> 05:41:52,480
Nobody ever realized that Wukong's chapter 2 was actually 55 years long.

7009
05:41:53,960 --> 05:41:56,740
No one has seen chapter 3 yet.

7010
05:42:02,400 --> 05:42:05,780
What does chapter 3 even look like?

7011
05:42:08,320 --> 05:42:10,840
I don't like how this is an open area.

7012
05:42:11,120 --> 05:42:13,140
This does not bring me joy.

7013
05:42:16,960 --> 05:42:18,100
Oh, no.

7014
05:42:18,560 --> 05:42:20,240
Oh, no.

7015
05:42:23,560 --> 05:42:27,520
This does not bring me joy at all.

7016
05:42:30,600 --> 05:42:31,680
Oh my god.

7017
05:42:31,700 --> 05:42:32,600
Where am I supposed to go?

7018
05:42:37,030 --> 05:42:40,050
Was I not supposed to go into the middle of the sand?

7019
05:42:41,270 --> 05:42:41,910
NPC?

7020
05:42:42,070 --> 05:42:43,830
Oh shit, there he is.

7021
05:42:44,250 --> 05:42:44,890
Oops.

7022
05:42:46,670 --> 05:42:54,650
I somehow missed the giant ass NPC that is like the size of a fucking building.

7023
05:42:55,270 --> 05:42:56,650
Alright, don't worry.

7024
05:42:56,770 --> 05:42:57,490
I'm heading over.

7025
05:42:57,630 --> 05:42:59,130
I'm getting there.

7026
05:43:02,030 --> 05:43:03,790
Alright, here I come.

7027
05:43:06,270 --> 05:43:07,950
I don't know how I missed that.

7028
05:43:07,950 --> 05:43:11,290
Because chapter 2 was deroading my brain right now.

7029
05:43:14,810 --> 05:43:16,170
Oh no.

7030
05:43:16,270 --> 05:43:17,350
How do I get back up?

7031
05:43:17,690 --> 05:43:18,570
Oh no.

7032
05:43:18,730 --> 05:43:19,170
Wukong.

7033
05:43:19,490 --> 05:43:21,990
How do we get back up?

7034
05:43:22,250 --> 05:43:22,930
Wukong.

7035
05:43:23,210 --> 05:43:24,790
True Monk.

7036
05:43:25,470 --> 05:43:28,210
Are we stuck down here?

7037
05:43:29,910 --> 05:43:32,430
Guys, this is not looking so good.

7038
05:43:32,950 --> 05:43:33,130
Alright.

7039
05:43:33,330 --> 05:43:35,370
We're skateboarding.

7040
05:43:37,110 --> 05:43:39,330
We have to use the item.

7041
05:43:39,770 --> 05:43:40,990
Okay, here we go.

7042
05:43:42,930 --> 05:43:44,690
I hate monkey cat.

7043
05:43:44,690 --> 05:43:46,690
I'm sad too hard.

7044
05:43:51,300 --> 05:43:52,300
Oh my god.

7045
05:43:53,720 --> 05:43:54,360
Alright.

7046
05:43:55,180 --> 05:43:56,200
Here we go.

7047
05:43:59,160 --> 05:44:00,160
Hello, sir.

7048
05:44:03,340 --> 05:44:04,960
Oh, I'm not being a thrust.

7049
05:44:05,300 --> 05:44:06,360
Are you a turtle?

7050
05:44:07,500 --> 05:44:08,740
No, are you a giant rat?

7051
05:44:11,250 --> 05:44:12,040
What are you?

7052
05:44:14,140 --> 05:44:15,620
Are you a giant...

7053
05:44:15,620 --> 05:44:16,320
Oh.

7054
05:44:17,040 --> 05:44:17,620
Oh.

7055
05:44:17,620 --> 05:44:17,920
Hmph.

7056
05:44:18,420 --> 05:44:20,500
I think you have some kind of magic power.

7057
05:44:21,300 --> 05:44:24,200
I don't know what magic power that monster has.

7058
05:44:24,200 --> 05:44:25,180
I'm not interested.

7059
05:44:25,620 --> 05:44:26,720
I can't even share it with the three of you.

7060
05:44:29,200 --> 05:44:31,140
I need to lure that monster out.

7061
05:44:31,540 --> 05:44:33,100
I need to use the Thunderbolt.

7062
05:44:34,000 --> 05:44:36,980
I can lure out the giant bug with my Thunderbolt.

7063
05:44:36,980 --> 05:44:38,300
Master Splinter?

7064
05:45:06,200 --> 05:45:06,720
Dune.

7065
05:45:06,820 --> 05:45:07,040
Yeah.

7066
05:45:07,060 --> 05:45:07,780
I was thinking that.

7067
05:45:07,840 --> 05:45:10,120
And then the Sadworm comes up.

7068
05:45:10,360 --> 05:45:11,260
Holy shit!

7069
05:45:11,300 --> 05:45:12,600
That's the giant-ass beetle.

7070
05:45:16,720 --> 05:45:21,560
Holy f- Digimon.

7071
05:45:21,860 --> 05:45:23,120
Digital monsters.

7072
05:45:23,400 --> 05:45:24,740
Ba-ba-ba champion.

7073
05:45:25,880 --> 05:45:26,720
digimon.

7074
05:45:27,500 --> 05:45:30,320
I see the digimon evolution.

7075
05:45:30,860 --> 05:45:32,500
Is that kabuterimon?

7076
05:45:38,060 --> 05:45:39,700
Oh my God, that's him!

7077
05:45:41,580 --> 05:45:43,860
We made it to the west!

7078
05:45:43,940 --> 05:45:44,200
H-day.

7079
05:46:03,320 --> 05:46:06,940
Oh, I have to kill him for him?

7080
05:46:11,580 --> 05:46:13,380
But aren't you also a Yaoguai?

7081
05:46:15,840 --> 05:46:17,120
What's wrong with this guy?

7082
05:46:18,600 --> 05:46:21,040
Why is this guy worse than your guy?

7083
05:46:22,900 --> 05:46:24,180
We're all guys here.

7084
05:46:26,380 --> 05:46:27,080
All right.

7085
05:46:28,580 --> 05:46:29,020
Okay.

7086
05:46:30,780 --> 05:46:31,860
Is he going to help?

7087
05:46:36,900 --> 05:46:38,160
Yeah, I can see that.

7088
05:46:39,080 --> 05:46:39,920
Oh, shit.

7089
05:46:40,340 --> 05:46:41,180
Oh, shit.

7090
05:46:41,880 --> 05:46:43,320
So, like, is he going to help me?

7091
05:46:48,000 --> 05:46:49,500
Is that not the claws?

7092
05:46:50,100 --> 05:46:50,700
Like...

7093
05:46:51,800 --> 05:46:53,820
Oh, this claw.

7094
05:46:54,260 --> 05:46:55,240
Oh, okay.

7095
05:46:55,400 --> 05:46:55,960
Wow.

7096
05:46:56,500 --> 05:46:57,080
Wow.

7097
05:46:58,420 --> 05:46:59,580
Oh, hey.

7098
05:47:00,700 --> 05:47:01,300
Um...

7099
05:47:02,320 --> 05:47:02,920
Um...

7100
05:47:03,680 --> 05:47:05,040
So, is he going to...

7101
05:47:05,040 --> 05:47:05,920
Is he helping?

7102
05:47:06,420 --> 05:47:09,860
He said he was going to help, right?

7103
05:47:11,960 --> 05:47:12,560
Right?

7104
05:47:14,020 --> 05:47:14,840
All right.

7105
05:47:14,900 --> 05:47:15,480
Big baby.

7106
05:47:16,160 --> 05:47:17,000
I don't know.

7107
05:47:17,060 --> 05:47:19,800
I'm a little concerned at the lack of helping part here.

7108
05:47:23,740 --> 05:47:24,780
All right.

7109
05:47:24,780 --> 05:47:25,020
Nice.

7110
05:47:25,280 --> 05:47:25,660
You know what?

7111
05:47:25,700 --> 05:47:26,060
Fuck it.

7112
05:47:26,100 --> 05:47:26,320
Monkey.

7113
05:47:26,500 --> 05:47:27,140
Oh, no!

7114
05:47:30,360 --> 05:47:32,480
I couldn't use my monkey powers.

7115
05:47:38,620 --> 05:47:39,140
Okay.

7116
05:47:39,140 --> 05:47:40,560
I'm a little worried here.

7117
05:47:40,860 --> 05:47:42,880
He seems extra tanky.

7118
05:47:42,920 --> 05:47:44,680
I'm a little worried.

7119
05:47:46,240 --> 05:47:47,980
Is he just cheering me on?

7120
05:47:47,980 --> 05:47:49,880
He's not even going to help.

7121
05:47:51,260 --> 05:47:52,860
He's like, The weak points the claws.

7122
05:47:53,000 --> 05:47:53,580
Yeah, no shit.

7123
05:47:53,620 --> 05:47:54,200
It's the claws.

7124
05:47:58,920 --> 05:47:59,440
All right.

7125
05:48:03,740 --> 05:48:05,320
Now he goes back in.

7126
05:48:06,000 --> 05:48:07,020
He's just...

7127
05:48:07,020 --> 05:48:08,760
He's my backseater.

7128
05:48:10,180 --> 05:48:11,520
He's a dragoon.

7129
05:48:12,100 --> 05:48:13,680
He's in a backseat.

7130
05:48:14,620 --> 05:48:16,060
Let's fucking go.

7131
05:48:16,500 --> 05:48:17,020
Let's fucking go.

7132
05:48:21,260 --> 05:48:21,960
All right.

7133
05:48:23,020 --> 05:48:23,820
All right.

7134
05:48:26,280 --> 05:48:26,880
All right.

7135
05:48:26,900 --> 05:48:27,380
What do I do?

7136
05:48:29,620 --> 05:48:30,420
He lied.

7137
05:48:30,500 --> 05:48:30,940
He lied!

7138
05:48:36,400 --> 05:48:37,840
He was like, Don't worry.

7139
05:48:38,040 --> 05:48:38,920
I'm going to help you.

7140
05:48:39,280 --> 05:48:40,340
I was like, Oh, shit.

7141
05:48:40,380 --> 05:48:40,580
Nice.

7142
05:48:40,900 --> 05:48:42,380
We were going to 2v1 him, right?

7143
05:48:49,510 --> 05:48:50,070
All right.

7144
05:48:52,010 --> 05:48:53,450
He told me to dodge.

7145
05:48:53,530 --> 05:48:54,570
That's all I needed.

7146
05:48:54,570 --> 05:48:55,310
He's not here.

7147
05:48:55,350 --> 05:48:56,170
He can't run.

7148
05:48:58,510 --> 05:48:59,190
What?

7149
05:49:01,530 --> 05:49:02,530
What happened?

7150
05:49:02,850 --> 05:49:05,210
Did I stub my toe?

7151
05:49:07,210 --> 05:49:10,630
Did I stub my toe in the fucking sand?

7152
05:49:11,370 --> 05:49:11,910
Did I stub my toe in the fucking sand?

7153
05:49:11,910 --> 05:49:13,190
Did I stub my toe in the fucking sand?

7154
05:49:14,770 --> 05:49:16,230
What the fuck?

7155
05:49:16,950 --> 05:49:18,170
Holy shit.

7156
05:49:18,230 --> 05:49:19,670
What the fuck was that?

7157
05:49:20,850 --> 05:49:22,130
He's the assistant.

7158
05:49:22,830 --> 05:49:24,810
Oh, thank you for helping me.

7159
05:49:25,650 --> 05:49:26,370
Thank you.

7160
05:49:28,510 --> 05:49:29,710
He's the vessel.

7161
05:49:31,190 --> 05:49:31,710
Here?

7162
05:49:33,690 --> 05:49:34,550
Where's the vessel?

7163
05:49:36,570 --> 05:49:37,390
Where is it?

7164
05:49:39,090 --> 05:49:40,150
Oh, there it is.

7165
05:49:40,410 --> 05:49:41,770
How the fuck do I get it?

7166
05:49:43,550 --> 05:49:44,070
What?

7167
05:49:44,970 --> 05:49:46,610
Sir, how do I get it?

7168
05:49:51,700 --> 05:49:52,680
That's the butt?

7169
05:49:53,500 --> 05:49:54,260
Oh, there it is.

7170
05:49:55,460 --> 05:49:56,320
How the fuck?

7171
05:49:56,520 --> 05:49:56,920
Oh, okay.

7172
05:49:59,380 --> 05:50:00,700
Okay, I figured it out.

7173
05:50:02,260 --> 05:50:04,820
Guys, surely he's going to keep sleeping, right?

7174
05:50:07,020 --> 05:50:08,140
Oh, my God.

7175
05:50:08,800 --> 05:50:09,280
Yoink.

7176
05:50:09,300 --> 05:50:10,800
You're my giant eye.

7177
05:50:16,980 --> 05:50:19,000
Yeah, the horn needed yellow paint, guys.

7178
05:50:19,100 --> 05:50:19,820
The horn.

7179
05:50:21,240 --> 05:50:22,420
Oh, my God.

7180
05:50:22,720 --> 05:50:23,200
Finally.

7181
05:50:24,280 --> 05:50:25,520
Oh, my God.

7182
05:50:25,520 --> 05:50:27,380
He's finally going to help.

7183
05:50:28,200 --> 05:50:29,520
Holy shit.

7184
05:50:29,600 --> 05:50:32,960
This is Godzilla vs King Kong right there.

7185
05:50:34,200 --> 05:50:35,520
This is Godzilla vs King Kong right there.

7186
05:50:35,520 --> 05:50:36,100
Alright, nice.

7187
05:50:36,380 --> 05:50:38,300
Okay, that's not helping.

7188
05:50:38,520 --> 05:50:40,100
He still aims for me.

7189
05:50:41,220 --> 05:50:42,020
That's cool.

7190
05:50:43,420 --> 05:50:45,240
Alright, we both hit the arms.

7191
05:50:45,580 --> 05:50:47,140
We both do the thing.

7192
05:50:47,260 --> 05:50:47,820
Together.

7193
05:50:48,440 --> 05:50:49,100
Right?

7194
05:50:49,420 --> 05:50:50,080
Together.

7195
05:50:50,080 --> 05:50:50,300
Together.

7196
05:50:53,320 --> 05:50:54,500
Oh, my God.

7197
05:50:54,560 --> 05:50:55,900
He's actually helping.

7198
05:50:57,960 --> 05:50:59,740
That's fucking crazy.

7199
05:51:01,780 --> 05:51:02,380
That's fucking crazy.

7200
05:51:02,380 --> 05:51:03,140
Holy shit.

7201
05:51:03,260 --> 05:51:04,900
The kaiju battle.

7202
05:51:05,460 --> 05:51:06,500
The kaiju battle.

7203
05:51:08,720 --> 05:51:11,140
There's some child-ass kaiju right there.

7204
05:51:11,600 --> 05:51:11,860
There's some child-ass kaiju right there.

7205
05:51:13,800 --> 05:51:14,960
Oh, my God.

7206
05:51:15,120 --> 05:51:16,220
Go, Meese, go.

7207
05:51:16,960 --> 05:51:18,680
Take that, kaiju.

7208
05:51:18,760 --> 05:51:22,060
For all of me.

7209
05:51:25,860 --> 05:51:27,460
Okay, judging by the fact...

7210
05:51:27,460 --> 05:51:29,040
Wait, so, like, I made this happen.

7211
05:51:33,880 --> 05:51:34,760
Who's afraid of you?

7212
05:51:34,900 --> 05:51:35,500
It's not me.

7213
05:51:37,040 --> 05:51:38,160
Yeah, you're a fucking bug.

7214
05:51:38,240 --> 05:51:39,080
I'm just going to squish you.

7215
05:51:39,360 --> 05:51:41,080
I'm going to fucking squish your hand.

7216
05:51:41,480 --> 05:51:43,160
I like how I'm just hitting the hand.

7217
05:51:47,280 --> 05:51:48,080
Oh, man.

7218
05:51:48,080 --> 05:51:48,160
Oh, me.

7219
05:51:54,510 --> 05:51:56,150
Wait, so, I caused this.

7220
05:52:00,710 --> 05:52:02,290
We used to be friends.

7221
05:52:02,430 --> 05:52:03,170
What happened?

7222
05:52:16,430 --> 05:52:17,610
Oh, shit.

7223
05:52:19,790 --> 05:52:20,390
Oh.

7224
05:52:21,550 --> 05:52:22,870
Oh, my God.

7225
05:52:32,090 --> 05:52:33,650
Holy fuck.

7226
05:52:34,050 --> 05:52:36,170
Why couldn't he do that earlier?

7227
05:52:39,150 --> 05:52:40,910
Why did he need us?

7228
05:52:41,210 --> 05:52:41,650
Exactly.

7229
05:52:42,310 --> 05:52:44,590
Why was I there?

7230
05:52:50,010 --> 05:52:52,070
Oh, my God.

7231
05:52:54,010 --> 05:52:57,090
And then we became best friends.

7232
05:52:58,490 --> 05:53:00,890
He needed a witness.

7233
05:53:01,450 --> 05:53:03,690
His vanguard couldn't watch him.

7234
05:53:03,730 --> 05:53:04,870
So, he needed me there.

7235
05:53:06,610 --> 05:53:09,110
I thought Q was the moral support.

7236
05:53:09,330 --> 05:53:12,670
But I was the moral support in the end.

7237
05:53:18,650 --> 05:53:20,090
That's actually crazy.

7238
05:53:22,010 --> 05:53:27,010
Abide by the Buddha's decree here to subdue the yellow wind guai.

7239
05:53:27,730 --> 05:53:28,930
Wind tamer?

7240
05:53:29,350 --> 05:53:30,530
How do I get that?

7241
05:53:30,670 --> 05:53:30,930
Oh, my God.

7242
05:53:33,750 --> 05:53:35,570
He needed a witness.

7243
05:53:36,650 --> 05:53:37,730
Witness me.

7244
05:53:40,230 --> 05:53:41,050
All right.

7245
05:53:42,670 --> 05:53:44,590
We need to...

7246
05:53:44,590 --> 05:53:49,790
Yeah, but he was on the floor for, like, a good five minutes.

7247
05:53:49,910 --> 05:53:51,750
He did not need me to...

7248
05:53:51,750 --> 05:53:55,550
Like, he could literally hit the drum, went downstairs, and got it.

7249
05:53:55,630 --> 05:53:59,450
Like, he did not need me to watch.

7250
05:53:59,990 --> 05:54:00,910
He literally...

7251
05:54:00,950 --> 05:54:02,070
He literally had it covered.

7252
05:54:02,350 --> 05:54:06,610
I, like, stood there confused because I was like, Where's the tip of this nose?

7253
05:54:06,770 --> 05:54:07,870
Like, where do I...

7254
05:54:07,870 --> 05:54:09,650
Where do I go?

7255
05:54:10,950 --> 05:54:11,670
Oh, no.

7256
05:54:11,750 --> 05:54:12,270
There it is.

7257
05:54:13,590 --> 05:54:14,330
All right.

7258
05:54:14,430 --> 05:54:15,870
We gotta...

7259
05:54:16,810 --> 05:54:17,850
He wanted...

7260
05:54:17,850 --> 05:54:21,330
He just wanted to...

7261
05:54:21,330 --> 05:54:21,650
All right.

7262
05:54:21,670 --> 05:54:22,710
Where do I have to travel here?

7263
05:54:25,510 --> 05:54:26,550
Is this...

7264
05:54:26,550 --> 05:54:28,430
No, that's the secret kingdom.

7265
05:54:28,930 --> 05:54:30,590
Where's the final boss?

7266
05:54:33,270 --> 05:54:34,630
Is it Windsteel Gate?

7267
05:54:37,870 --> 05:54:38,930
He wanted...

7268
05:54:42,050 --> 05:54:45,210
He needed witnesses so people can tell the tale.

7269
05:54:46,090 --> 05:54:49,770
He was thinking that I would write a story about what happened.

7270
05:54:50,750 --> 05:54:51,090
What?

7271
05:54:51,130 --> 05:54:52,030
Tiger Cellar?

7272
05:54:56,250 --> 05:54:57,910
Is this chapter...

7273
05:54:57,910 --> 05:54:58,150
Yes.

7274
05:54:58,330 --> 05:55:00,050
We're still there.

7275
05:55:00,630 --> 05:55:02,990
It's still chapter two.

7276
05:55:03,570 --> 05:55:03,910
Yes.

7277
05:55:04,310 --> 05:55:05,310
Yes, it is.

7278
05:55:05,350 --> 05:55:08,170
It has never stopped being chapter two.

7279
05:55:08,870 --> 05:55:09,610
Oh, cool.

7280
05:55:12,790 --> 05:55:14,370
I mean, that looks cool.

7281
05:55:17,050 --> 05:55:17,610
Yeah.

7282
05:55:18,010 --> 05:55:19,110
I wanna wear that.

7283
05:55:20,990 --> 05:55:21,550
Okay.

7284
05:55:22,710 --> 05:55:25,410
I do not have enough items.

7285
05:55:25,650 --> 05:55:27,130
That is not good.

7286
05:55:27,810 --> 05:55:29,450
Do I even have the...

7287
05:55:31,170 --> 05:55:35,610
Oh, I don't even have the additional damage anymore because I don't have the thing.

7288
05:55:36,750 --> 05:55:37,230
Oh...

7289
05:55:38,150 --> 05:55:38,850
Fuck it.

7290
05:55:38,950 --> 05:55:39,770
We're gonna keep doing it.

7291
05:55:39,830 --> 05:55:40,910
We're gonna keep it.

7292
05:55:41,550 --> 05:55:45,230
And then we gotta go to the Tiger Cellar yet again.

7293
05:55:50,560 --> 05:55:53,480
So my big rat friend literally went ham on this giant beetle.

7294
05:56:00,350 --> 05:56:04,070
Wait, where do we go?

7295
05:56:05,610 --> 05:56:06,330
After that.

7296
05:56:06,330 --> 05:56:08,250
Wait, is this not the Tiger Cellar?

7297
05:56:10,690 --> 05:56:11,790
Equip the vessel?

7298
05:56:13,090 --> 05:56:14,050
The vessel?

7299
05:56:17,820 --> 05:56:18,740
What's the...

7300
05:56:18,740 --> 05:56:19,840
Which one is the vessel?

7301
05:56:21,700 --> 05:56:22,400
Oh!

7302
05:56:23,080 --> 05:56:23,780
Okay.

7303
05:56:25,260 --> 05:56:31,120
Massively increases damage reduction for a short amount grants immunity highly effective against specific...

7304
05:56:31,120 --> 05:56:31,320
Oh!

7305
05:56:32,360 --> 05:56:33,060
Wait.

7306
05:56:37,080 --> 05:56:38,540
I'm gonna watch the demo.

7307
05:56:39,160 --> 05:56:39,860
Wait.

7308
05:56:40,020 --> 05:56:40,420
That's...

7309
05:56:46,040 --> 05:56:47,020
Oh, that's sick.

7310
05:56:48,620 --> 05:56:50,400
Yeah, it counters the last boss.

7311
05:56:52,620 --> 05:56:53,140
Okay.

7312
05:56:56,060 --> 05:56:56,580
Uh...

7313
05:56:57,300 --> 05:56:57,820
Oops.

7314
05:56:57,900 --> 05:56:59,040
That's not what... Oh, no.

7315
05:57:00,060 --> 05:57:01,100
No, baby!

7316
05:57:02,500 --> 05:57:03,020
No!

7317
05:57:04,960 --> 05:57:05,600
It's okay.

7318
05:57:05,660 --> 05:57:06,140
We can rest.

7319
05:57:06,440 --> 05:57:07,660
We can fix it.

7320
05:57:08,160 --> 05:57:10,020
I can... I'll just rest.

7321
05:57:10,300 --> 05:57:11,660
Oh, and I can upgrade the baby!

7322
05:57:12,220 --> 05:57:13,520
Baby is strong!

7323
05:57:14,820 --> 05:57:17,800
Baby is even stronger now!

7324
05:57:19,220 --> 05:57:20,020
Thank God.

7325
05:57:20,400 --> 05:57:21,680
Thank God.

7326
05:57:22,340 --> 05:57:23,060
Oh, my God.

7327
05:57:23,100 --> 05:57:25,280
There was, like, something I saw that I could craft.

7328
05:57:26,140 --> 05:57:26,740
Oh, wait.

7329
05:57:26,780 --> 05:57:27,040
No, no.

7330
05:57:27,080 --> 05:57:27,700
Not crafting.

7331
05:57:27,940 --> 05:57:29,960
Um... It was...

7332
05:57:29,960 --> 05:57:32,760
I got too... Baby got too happy.

7333
05:57:34,220 --> 05:57:34,700
Alright.

7334
05:57:35,420 --> 05:57:37,180
Upon successful hits with...

7335
05:57:37,900 --> 05:57:38,700
Wait, what is it?

7336
05:57:38,760 --> 05:57:41,840
Upon successful hits with, like, combo mod or increased attack...

7337
05:57:41,840 --> 05:57:43,420
I feel like spell is more important.

7338
05:57:44,080 --> 05:57:44,560
100%.

7339
05:57:45,720 --> 05:57:46,760
Baby maxing.

7340
05:57:46,800 --> 05:57:47,720
I might as well upgrade...

7341
05:57:47,720 --> 05:57:49,540
I think I have more mind cores, right?

7342
05:57:49,740 --> 05:57:50,680
I'm pretty sure.

7343
05:57:52,000 --> 05:57:52,520
Dog!

7344
05:57:52,520 --> 05:57:54,560
I'm here to upgrade my mind.

7345
05:57:58,940 --> 05:57:59,460
Wait.

7346
05:57:59,500 --> 05:57:59,680
Wait.

7347
05:57:59,680 --> 05:58:00,960
Remake Celestial Medicine?

7348
05:58:02,560 --> 05:58:03,080
Oh!

7349
05:58:03,320 --> 05:58:04,040
It, like...

7350
05:58:04,040 --> 05:58:04,300
Oh!

7351
05:58:05,020 --> 05:58:07,340
I can, like, re... Alright.

7352
05:58:07,440 --> 05:58:08,320
What do we want, guys?

7353
05:58:11,420 --> 05:58:12,680
Guys, what do we want?

7354
05:58:13,900 --> 05:58:15,120
Do we want...

7355
05:58:16,580 --> 05:58:17,100
HP?

7356
05:58:17,100 --> 05:58:17,620
Mana?

7357
05:58:18,580 --> 05:58:19,100
Stamina?

7358
05:58:19,100 --> 05:58:19,620
Defense?

7359
05:58:19,840 --> 05:58:20,580
Or Recovery?

7360
05:58:20,920 --> 05:58:21,840
HP and Mana?

7361
05:58:22,480 --> 05:58:23,000
Okay...

7362
05:58:24,080 --> 05:58:25,340
I can only use once.

7363
05:58:29,240 --> 05:58:29,760
HP...

7364
05:58:31,180 --> 05:58:32,220
And then...

7365
05:58:32,220 --> 05:58:34,320
I hope I did not get one guy.

7366
05:58:34,400 --> 05:58:36,620
I literally saw the fastest typer in my chat.

7367
05:58:38,800 --> 05:58:40,320
I swear to God.

7368
05:58:40,960 --> 05:58:41,400
I...

7369
05:58:42,080 --> 05:58:42,520
I...

7370
05:58:43,600 --> 05:58:46,420
Whoever typed to me the fastest...

7371
05:58:49,720 --> 05:58:50,160
Alright.

7372
05:58:51,760 --> 05:58:53,020
I got the HP.

7373
05:58:56,880 --> 05:58:57,320
Alright.

7374
05:58:57,620 --> 05:58:58,280
It's time.

7375
05:58:58,540 --> 05:58:59,120
Is it time?

7376
05:58:59,720 --> 05:59:02,400
Wait, then why the fuck did I go to the Tiger's Cellar?

7377
05:59:02,960 --> 05:59:03,900
I didn't even...

7378
05:59:03,900 --> 05:59:05,780
Oh, I guess you want me to upgrade my mind thing.

7379
05:59:05,820 --> 05:59:06,360
Just walk down?

7380
05:59:06,600 --> 05:59:07,540
Oh, I could just walk down.

7381
05:59:07,600 --> 05:59:07,980
Oh, yeah!

7382
05:59:09,320 --> 05:59:09,760
That's...

7383
05:59:09,780 --> 05:59:09,860
That's why.

7384
05:59:10,320 --> 05:59:12,080
I could just walk down.

7385
05:59:12,420 --> 05:59:13,320
Wait, I didn't know!

7386
05:59:13,400 --> 05:59:14,860
I forgot to res... Okay.

7387
05:59:15,160 --> 05:59:16,760
We're not going down the slide yet.

7388
05:59:16,900 --> 05:59:18,900
I forgot to reset my thing.

7389
05:59:19,640 --> 05:59:21,120
We need to reset the baby.

7390
05:59:22,620 --> 05:59:24,360
We need to reset the baby.

7391
05:59:26,700 --> 05:59:27,220
Okay.

7392
05:59:28,620 --> 05:59:29,140
Alright.

7393
05:59:29,260 --> 05:59:30,480
Baby has been reset.

7394
05:59:31,320 --> 05:59:33,460
Wait, I don't even have like...

7395
05:59:33,460 --> 05:59:35,300
I don't even have the...

7396
05:59:35,300 --> 05:59:36,260
Oh, I have the immunity now.

7397
05:59:36,340 --> 05:59:36,580
Okay.

7398
05:59:36,580 --> 05:59:37,880
Finally.

7399
05:59:38,220 --> 05:59:39,140
We're here.

7400
05:59:41,080 --> 05:59:42,600
We're finally here.

7401
05:59:44,310 --> 05:59:44,960
I'm back.

7402
05:59:46,180 --> 05:59:48,260
We used to be friends.

7403
05:59:49,240 --> 05:59:50,540
What happened?

7404
05:59:53,620 --> 05:59:55,300
What happened, bro?

7405
05:59:55,360 --> 05:59:56,980
We used to be friends!

7406
05:59:58,330 --> 05:59:59,120
What happened?

7407
06:00:00,320 --> 06:00:02,720
We used to be best of friends!

7408
06:00:04,860 --> 06:00:06,440
Wait, did my ability stop?

7409
06:00:07,300 --> 06:00:07,940
Wait, did my ability stop?

7410
06:00:08,280 --> 06:00:08,920
Wait!

7411
06:00:09,780 --> 06:00:10,420
Wait!

7412
06:00:10,700 --> 06:00:13,400
You guys didn't tell me that like...

7413
06:00:13,400 --> 06:00:14,680
Wait a minute!

7414
06:00:16,440 --> 06:00:17,640
Wait, I didn't know!

7415
06:00:17,760 --> 06:00:20,400
When you transform, it's different!

7416
06:00:20,600 --> 06:00:21,120
God!

7417
06:00:24,720 --> 06:00:29,260
You guys didn't know when you transform, it doesn't exist anymore.

7418
06:00:32,380 --> 06:00:33,860
Oh, no!

7419
06:00:34,200 --> 06:00:34,940
Oh, no!

7420
06:00:36,140 --> 06:00:37,380
Oh, no!

7421
06:00:37,380 --> 06:00:38,980
I didn't know!

7422
06:00:39,600 --> 06:00:40,740
I didn't know!

7423
06:00:40,740 --> 06:00:41,180
I'm so...

7424
06:00:41,180 --> 06:00:43,260
I'm so stupid!

7425
06:00:46,840 --> 06:00:47,640
Please!

7426
06:00:48,280 --> 06:00:50,300
We used to be very good friends!

7427
06:00:50,760 --> 06:00:51,920
What happened?

7428
06:00:52,240 --> 06:00:54,100
I helped you get that thing!

7429
06:00:55,940 --> 06:00:57,140
Oh, God!

7430
06:00:57,940 --> 06:00:59,160
Oh, God!

7431
06:00:59,260 --> 06:00:59,660
Oh!

7432
06:01:00,440 --> 06:01:01,120
Oh!

7433
06:01:01,300 --> 06:01:02,520
I wanted to die!

7434
06:01:04,380 --> 06:01:05,060
Oh!

7435
06:01:09,040 --> 06:01:09,820
My God!

7436
06:01:10,060 --> 06:01:11,080
Okay, we know now!

7437
06:01:11,580 --> 06:01:12,860
We know now!

7438
06:01:13,480 --> 06:01:15,040
Now we know!

7439
06:01:18,840 --> 06:01:22,180
What do you mean I spent three hours to beat this guy?

7440
06:01:22,520 --> 06:01:22,800
No!

7441
06:01:22,820 --> 06:01:23,860
Don't say that!

7442
06:01:25,000 --> 06:01:25,680
Please!

7443
06:01:25,680 --> 06:01:25,940
Please!

7444
06:01:27,740 --> 06:01:33,320
Wait until he starts summoning... He starts summoning tornadoes?

7445
06:01:33,680 --> 06:01:34,940
Oh, no!

7446
06:01:35,520 --> 06:01:37,240
Oh, no!

7447
06:01:38,040 --> 06:01:39,720
Okay, we can do this, guys!

7448
06:01:39,960 --> 06:01:41,060
Guys, this is...

7449
06:01:41,060 --> 06:01:42,000
This is fun!

7450
06:01:42,880 --> 06:01:44,540
Now that I know!

7451
06:01:44,800 --> 06:01:46,760
I won't use it!

7452
06:01:47,500 --> 06:01:47,840
Alright!

7453
06:01:48,180 --> 06:01:51,680
Now that we know tornadoes exist...

7454
06:01:53,320 --> 06:01:56,300
Surely nothing bad will happen to us!

7455
06:01:56,840 --> 06:01:57,400
Right?

7456
06:01:58,440 --> 06:01:59,000
Surely!

7457
06:02:00,060 --> 06:02:00,620
Alright!

7458
06:02:00,720 --> 06:02:01,300
Big baby!

7459
06:02:01,840 --> 06:02:02,400
Baby!

7460
06:02:04,200 --> 06:02:05,540
Big baby mode!

7461
06:02:07,400 --> 06:02:08,320
Baby mode!

7462
06:02:09,400 --> 06:02:09,960
You know what?

7463
06:02:10,160 --> 06:02:10,660
Hair!

7464
06:02:11,440 --> 06:02:12,540
That's fucking right!

7465
06:02:12,740 --> 06:02:13,500
Oh, fuck!

7466
06:02:13,580 --> 06:02:13,820
Okay!

7467
06:02:14,500 --> 06:02:15,180
That's right!

7468
06:02:15,220 --> 06:02:16,020
We're all coming in now!

7469
06:02:16,460 --> 06:02:17,160
That's right!

7470
06:02:17,620 --> 06:02:18,080
Hair!

7471
06:02:19,760 --> 06:02:20,580
Oh, shit!

7472
06:02:21,420 --> 06:02:22,140
Oh, shit!

7473
06:02:22,460 --> 06:02:24,000
Let's hope that's not tornadoes, right?

7474
06:02:24,140 --> 06:02:25,500
It's not tornadoes, right?

7475
06:02:25,680 --> 06:02:26,500
Yeah, that's not tornadoes.

7476
06:02:26,780 --> 06:02:28,200
Wait, where did he go?

7477
06:02:28,920 --> 06:02:29,900
Where did he go?

7478
06:02:30,600 --> 06:02:31,560
Where did he go?

7479
06:02:32,140 --> 06:02:33,080
Where did he go?

7480
06:02:34,400 --> 06:02:35,160
Oh, god!

7481
06:02:36,500 --> 06:02:37,540
Oh, shit!

7482
06:02:38,520 --> 06:02:39,040
Oh!

7483
06:02:40,720 --> 06:02:42,880
Okay, we gotta take that potion.

7484
06:02:44,340 --> 06:02:45,140
Alright, nice!

7485
06:02:46,100 --> 06:02:47,260
Alright, we definitely...

7486
06:02:47,260 --> 06:02:48,720
Guys, I think we waste...

7487
06:02:48,720 --> 06:02:50,220
We don't use multiple monkeys.

7488
06:02:50,580 --> 06:02:52,340
Multiple monkeys is a joke.

7489
06:02:52,580 --> 06:02:53,560
Oh, please!

7490
06:02:55,680 --> 06:02:56,060
Okay.

7491
06:02:57,620 --> 06:02:58,060
Alright.

7492
06:02:59,480 --> 06:03:00,640
I don't know what to do.

7493
06:03:02,760 --> 06:03:03,200
Alright.

7494
06:03:04,020 --> 06:03:04,460
Gosh.

7495
06:03:05,760 --> 06:03:06,200
Nice.

7496
06:03:07,240 --> 06:03:08,580
I can get this combo in, right?

7497
06:03:08,760 --> 06:03:09,180
Hit attack!

7498
06:03:09,480 --> 06:03:09,820
Yes!

7499
06:03:10,040 --> 06:03:10,800
I got critical!

7500
06:03:11,700 --> 06:03:12,460
That's fucking right!

7501
06:03:12,560 --> 06:03:13,700
Stabbed you in the ankle!

7502
06:03:14,000 --> 06:03:14,800
You're Achilles heel!

7503
06:03:15,020 --> 06:03:15,460
Oh, god!

7504
06:03:15,520 --> 06:03:16,260
He has a triumvirate!

7505
06:03:16,780 --> 06:03:17,220
What?!

7506
06:03:20,120 --> 06:03:20,680
That's right!

7507
06:03:21,740 --> 06:03:23,640
We stabbed you in the ankle!

7508
06:03:23,640 --> 06:03:26,000
Oh, I don't like that!

7509
06:03:26,120 --> 06:03:27,280
I dodged it?

7510
06:03:27,380 --> 06:03:27,940
I think I did.

7511
06:03:30,020 --> 06:03:31,040
And then stab!

7512
06:03:31,920 --> 06:03:32,660
Oh, my god!

7513
06:03:32,680 --> 06:03:33,280
He, like, kicked!

7514
06:03:35,100 --> 06:03:35,620
Okay.

7515
06:03:35,960 --> 06:03:38,100
He brought the bug back!

7516
06:03:40,340 --> 06:03:40,860
Okay.

7517
06:03:41,440 --> 06:03:41,960
Dodge!

7518
06:03:43,500 --> 06:03:44,300
Come on!

7519
06:03:44,640 --> 06:03:45,320
Halfway there!

7520
06:03:46,600 --> 06:03:47,940
We're halfway there!

7521
06:03:50,580 --> 06:03:51,100
Please!

7522
06:03:53,400 --> 06:03:53,840
Stab!

7523
06:03:54,500 --> 06:03:55,560
I need a chill!

7524
06:03:55,720 --> 06:03:56,280
I need a chill!

7525
06:03:56,380 --> 06:03:57,000
I need a chill!

7526
06:03:58,360 --> 06:03:58,800
Okay.

7527
06:03:58,800 --> 06:03:59,240
Nice!

7528
06:04:01,340 --> 06:04:03,200
Oh, I don't know half of his movesets!

7529
06:04:04,380 --> 06:04:06,440
I don't know what I'm doing!

7530
06:04:07,880 --> 06:04:08,640
I don't know what I'm doing!

7531
06:04:08,640 --> 06:04:10,080
What the fuck?!

7532
06:04:10,080 --> 06:04:11,040
Oh, shit!

7533
06:04:12,160 --> 06:04:12,600
Okay.

7534
06:04:13,180 --> 06:04:13,780
We're fine!

7535
06:04:13,920 --> 06:04:14,240
We're fine!

7536
06:04:16,320 --> 06:04:17,020
We're okay!

7537
06:04:18,500 --> 06:04:20,020
Is this a tornado?!

7538
06:04:20,020 --> 06:04:20,120
Is this a tornado?!

7539
06:04:21,260 --> 06:04:23,120
Oh, is that the tornado?!

7540
06:04:23,120 --> 06:04:23,960
Tornado!

7541
06:04:25,000 --> 06:04:25,820
Did I do it?

7542
06:04:27,260 --> 06:04:28,160
Oh, it is!

7543
06:04:28,460 --> 06:04:29,680
I fucking did it!

7544
06:04:34,120 --> 06:04:35,560
I fucking knew it!

7545
06:04:35,640 --> 06:04:37,100
I saw the wind!

7546
06:04:39,380 --> 06:04:40,880
I read the wind!

7547
06:04:41,500 --> 06:04:43,280
I have the power of the wind!

7548
06:04:43,420 --> 06:04:43,980
Oh, shit!

7549
06:04:44,180 --> 06:04:44,720
I'm so sorry!

7550
06:04:44,860 --> 06:04:46,140
I am so sorry!

7551
06:04:46,200 --> 06:04:46,900
I did not mean that!

7552
06:04:46,960 --> 06:04:47,600
You're so cool!

7553
06:04:47,780 --> 06:04:48,540
You're so cool!

7554
06:04:48,680 --> 06:04:49,600
And you're dead!

7555
06:04:53,440 --> 06:04:54,480
Oh, shit!

7556
06:05:04,040 --> 06:05:04,880
Shit!

7557
06:05:04,880 --> 06:05:05,420
Senior guy!

7558
06:05:09,060 --> 06:05:12,940
Yeah, why would you want to rule this desert?

7559
06:05:13,580 --> 06:05:17,340
I got lost in it for five hours straight!

7560
06:05:17,440 --> 06:05:18,400
Six hours!

7561
06:05:22,180 --> 06:05:22,600
Huh?!

7562
06:05:24,480 --> 06:05:25,360
That's his head?!

7563
06:05:26,100 --> 06:05:26,940
Oh my god!

7564
06:05:26,980 --> 06:05:28,140
That was his head all along!

7565
06:05:43,120 --> 06:05:45,320
Is that the king of Sandland?

7566
06:05:48,980 --> 06:05:49,400
Amitabha.

7567
06:05:49,920 --> 06:05:50,760
Amitabha.

7568
06:05:52,940 --> 06:05:53,780
Amitabha.

7569
06:05:54,840 --> 06:05:55,680
Amitabha.

7570
06:05:56,800 --> 06:05:57,220
Amitabha.

7571
06:05:59,440 --> 06:06:00,280
Amitabha.

7572
06:06:02,860 --> 06:06:03,280
Amitabha.

7573
06:06:05,620 --> 06:06:06,460
Amitabha.

7574
06:06:14,820 --> 06:06:17,620
This is...

7575
06:06:20,320 --> 06:06:21,720
It's my head!

7576
06:06:22,240 --> 06:06:23,940
I lied to you, wasn't it?

7577
06:06:23,940 --> 06:06:33,240
You talk about my head now!

7578
06:06:33,240 --> 06:06:35,540
It's not his head.

7579
06:06:35,540 --> 06:06:36,440
If you're lying,

7580
06:06:41,480 --> 06:06:42,740
We did it!

7581
06:06:43,100 --> 06:06:43,340
Wait!

7582
06:06:43,400 --> 06:06:46,220
So the rat was the bad guy that was all alive!

7583
06:06:52,380 --> 06:06:53,340
I'm worthy!

7584
06:07:00,220 --> 06:07:02,760
Apparently the rat was the bad guy!

7585
06:07:03,160 --> 06:07:04,200
He lied!

7586
06:07:04,200 --> 06:07:06,040
I thought we were friends!

7587
06:07:11,800 --> 06:07:13,920
I thought we were homies!

7588
06:07:22,700 --> 06:07:25,780
Oh, it's stop motion now?

7589
06:07:27,100 --> 06:07:28,880
That's so interesting!

7590
06:07:32,760 --> 06:07:34,920
Oh my god, it's so...

7591
06:07:34,920 --> 06:07:36,960
That's so cute!

7592
06:07:47,070 --> 06:07:48,510
I like how...

7593
06:07:49,150 --> 06:07:50,830
It's implied that the body was a musician.

7594
06:07:51,210 --> 06:07:52,930
He's like, I wanted to be...

7595
06:07:52,930 --> 06:07:55,010
I wanted to be a musician!

7596
06:07:55,350 --> 06:07:55,850
Dad!

7597
06:07:56,290 --> 06:07:57,570
And then the head was like, no.

7598
06:07:57,790 --> 06:08:01,450
The body was for music, but the head was for Buddha.

7599
06:08:06,840 --> 06:08:08,500
Oh, it was a girl!

7600
06:08:14,420 --> 06:08:15,020
Placement!

7601
06:08:15,300 --> 06:08:17,320
Oh my god!

7602
06:08:17,540 --> 06:08:20,540
The light placement to hide the nipple!

7603
06:08:24,160 --> 06:08:25,000
That's...

7604
06:08:26,080 --> 06:08:27,340
That's funny!

7605
06:08:28,840 --> 06:08:29,680
That's funny!

7606
06:08:29,680 --> 06:08:29,840
Whoa!

7607
06:08:38,030 --> 06:08:40,470
Oh my gosh, she's Brigante!

7608
06:08:49,530 --> 06:08:50,670
Oh shit!

7609
06:08:58,040 --> 06:08:59,440
Goodbye, son!

7610
06:09:05,730 --> 06:09:06,730
Don't worry.

7611
06:09:07,470 --> 06:09:09,450
We raised a good boy.

7612
06:09:12,490 --> 06:09:13,990
Hey, what's going on?

7613
06:09:14,330 --> 06:09:14,990
No!

7614
06:09:15,850 --> 06:09:17,350
What happened to the wife?

7615
06:09:40,160 --> 06:09:41,560
Is that the wife?

7616
06:09:48,820 --> 06:09:50,600
It was all a dream?

7617
06:10:11,810 --> 06:10:13,410
He killed her!

7618
06:10:31,500 --> 06:10:35,480
Oh my god!

7619
06:10:35,700 --> 06:10:36,580
He killed her!

7620
06:10:36,580 --> 06:10:36,820
That's so funny!

7621
06:10:37,080 --> 06:10:38,000
It was a dream!

7622
06:10:43,200 --> 06:10:45,360
Oh my god.

7623
06:10:45,540 --> 06:10:45,820
He killed her!

7624
06:10:46,200 --> 06:10:46,920
Oh my god.

7625
06:10:46,920 --> 06:10:47,540
Oh, my gosh.

7626
06:10:47,540 --> 06:10:47,880
Oh my god.

7627
06:10:47,880 --> 06:10:48,220
Oh my gosh.

7628
06:10:48,220 --> 06:10:48,740
Oh my god.

7629
06:10:48,860 --> 06:10:49,740
Oh my god.

7630
06:10:52,420 --> 06:10:52,940
Oh my god.

7631
06:10:54,600 --> 06:10:55,760
Oh my god.

7632
06:10:55,760 --> 06:10:59,720
Have you ever looked for the ancient land at the end of the sky?

7633
06:11:00,600 --> 06:11:05,160
And have you ever hit a lake, a river, a cliff, or a rock to fight?

7634
06:11:07,280 --> 06:11:10,140
I'm afraid that you are confused and confused.

7635
06:11:11,560 --> 06:11:15,120
The more you try, the more you can't find it.

7636
06:11:16,800 --> 06:11:19,520
A tree and a tiger are the same.

7637
06:11:20,120 --> 06:11:22,900
They don't have a destiny, and they don't accept it.

7638
06:11:24,240 --> 06:11:26,740
Little monkey, listen to me.

7639
06:11:27,300 --> 06:11:30,820
What the wind brings to you is the sound of hope.

7640
06:11:32,640 --> 06:11:35,620
Oh gee, thank you for the super chat.

7641
06:11:35,800 --> 06:11:37,000
Thank you, thank you.

7642
06:11:38,220 --> 06:11:41,660
Oh man, that's sad.

7643
06:11:42,740 --> 06:11:45,580
I guess he like got a vision of the future.

7644
06:11:46,060 --> 06:11:47,060
It's like...

7645
06:11:47,940 --> 06:11:49,500
And then he was like...

7646
06:11:49,500 --> 06:11:51,700
He doesn't want to go through that.

7647
06:11:51,840 --> 06:11:52,880
Because she basically...

7648
06:11:52,900 --> 06:11:53,540
Basically like...

7649
06:11:53,540 --> 06:11:54,720
Kills everybody.

7650
06:11:55,640 --> 06:11:59,880
And he's like, if I kill her before she kills everybody I love...

7651
06:12:01,420 --> 06:12:03,300
It's better that way.

7652
06:12:03,540 --> 06:12:04,420
That's so sad.

7653
06:12:04,900 --> 06:12:06,020
That's actually so sad.

7654
06:12:06,800 --> 06:12:08,000
Oh my god.

7655
06:12:08,560 --> 06:12:09,920
That's a sad storyline.

7656
06:12:15,820 --> 06:12:17,420
I'm pretty sure it's a vision.

7657
06:12:33,860 --> 06:12:37,020
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a vision for the future.

7658
06:12:37,280 --> 06:12:38,880
And then he was like, yeah, no.

7659
06:12:40,320 --> 06:12:41,020
What's this?

7660
06:12:41,440 --> 06:12:46,280
Pan gu zhi jin ceng jian feng, bu si zhe feng lai bu shan.

7661
06:12:47,040 --> 06:12:48,400
Nei chang feng ba.

7662
06:12:49,060 --> 06:12:51,180
Luan le jing gang, jing le luo han.

7663
06:12:51,420 --> 06:12:54,340
Wen shu zhou le qing shi, pu xian shi luo han.

7664
06:12:54,340 --> 06:12:57,100
Nong de san jie zhen chan.

7665
06:12:58,720 --> 06:13:02,020
Ai, zhe ban fa shu gao qiang de nie chu.

7666
06:13:02,400 --> 06:13:05,640
Yu jian shi ren de shifu shi tada fu fen.

7667
06:13:06,500 --> 06:13:09,400
Que ye cheng le tada zai nan.

7668
06:13:14,460 --> 06:13:15,780
Killing Simon's dad.

7669
06:13:16,160 --> 06:13:17,100
What about this?

7670
06:13:17,380 --> 06:13:21,020
Shou xing qian bai lu, lao jun qi qing niu.

7671
06:13:21,400 --> 06:13:25,560
Wen shu zuo qing shi, pu xian yu bai xiang.

7672
06:13:25,560 --> 06:13:27,820
Zhe ju chong...

7673
06:13:29,500 --> 06:13:32,400
Shuo bu zhun ye shi nei wei de zuo qi.

7674
06:13:36,350 --> 06:13:36,950
OK.

7675
06:13:37,630 --> 06:13:39,270
Dou shuo yao guai chi ren.

7676
06:13:39,730 --> 06:13:41,750
Qi shi ren ye chi ren.

7677
06:13:42,010 --> 06:13:43,870
Er qi chi de geng hen.

7678
06:13:44,930 --> 06:13:47,850
Na xiao xiao jing di de gong ping jiao yi.

7679
06:13:48,070 --> 06:13:51,410
Yu wai mian, yuo yuo he bu tou.

7680
06:13:56,460 --> 06:13:57,060
OK.

7681
06:13:59,840 --> 06:14:00,960
Yeah, that's the beat.

7682
06:14:00,980 --> 06:14:08,380
That's like the artwork of everything that happened, basically.

7683
06:14:09,400 --> 06:14:10,840
That's interesting.

7684
06:14:11,420 --> 06:14:14,180
Chapter 2, I did not...

7685
06:14:14,180 --> 06:14:17,760
I really liked the boss designs.

7686
06:14:18,120 --> 06:14:19,560
But oh my god.

7687
06:14:20,300 --> 06:14:23,840
Exploring chapter... the map was so difficult.

7688
06:14:27,760 --> 06:14:28,680
Like...

7689
06:14:28,680 --> 06:14:29,920
Um...

7690
06:14:30,880 --> 06:14:32,580
Yeah, it was like...

7691
06:14:32,580 --> 06:14:34,300
The chapter was long.

7692
06:14:34,520 --> 06:14:35,200
But like...

7693
06:14:35,200 --> 06:14:38,160
I think it was long because I kept getting lost.

7694
06:14:38,580 --> 06:14:40,940
I kept getting...

7695
06:14:42,280 --> 06:14:42,960
Um...

7696
06:14:42,960 --> 06:14:43,500
Um...

7697
06:14:43,500 --> 06:14:45,720
I definitely kept getting lost.

7698
06:14:45,820 --> 06:14:47,400
Because everything looked...

7699
06:14:47,920 --> 06:14:49,120
Very similar.

7700
06:14:49,520 --> 06:14:50,680
And like...

7701
06:14:50,680 --> 06:14:51,200
So like...

7702
06:14:51,200 --> 06:14:52,380
I just didn't know where to go.

7703
06:14:55,340 --> 06:14:57,080
I think like...

7704
06:14:57,080 --> 06:14:59,320
I definitely would have got even more lost.

7705
06:14:59,320 --> 06:15:00,400
Um...

7706
06:15:00,400 --> 06:15:02,060
I would have got more lost.

7707
06:15:02,260 --> 06:15:02,660
If like...

7708
06:15:02,660 --> 06:15:03,760
You guys didn't help me.

7709
06:15:04,000 --> 06:15:04,460
Um...

7710
06:15:04,460 --> 06:15:06,160
But I really did like...

7711
06:15:06,160 --> 06:15:07,260
I really like...

7712
06:15:07,260 --> 06:15:10,100
I really liked the monster designs in chapter 2.

7713
06:15:10,160 --> 06:15:14,900
I think I liked the monster designs more in chapter 2 than chapter 1.

7714
06:15:15,100 --> 06:15:16,040
The monsters...

7715
06:15:16,040 --> 06:15:19,020
The guais I fought in chapter 2 were more interesting.

7716
06:15:19,300 --> 06:15:20,100
I think.

7717
06:15:20,380 --> 06:15:21,360
And like...

7718
06:15:21,360 --> 06:15:22,540
There was more...

7719
06:15:22,540 --> 06:15:24,460
The combos were more interesting too.

7720
06:15:25,020 --> 06:15:25,580
Um...

7721
06:15:25,580 --> 06:15:27,260
I don't think this game needs a map.

7722
06:15:27,260 --> 06:15:28,440
It was just because like...

7723
06:15:29,040 --> 06:15:29,360
Uh...

7724
06:15:29,360 --> 06:15:32,740
Because it was like all similar in area.

7725
06:15:33,120 --> 06:15:35,080
Because it was just rocks and sand.

7726
06:15:35,400 --> 06:15:35,940
Like...

7727
06:15:36,820 --> 06:15:38,120
So it's like...

7728
06:15:38,120 --> 06:15:39,000
I couldn't...

7729
06:15:39,000 --> 06:15:40,260
It's so hard...

7730
06:15:40,260 --> 06:15:42,520
To figure out the landmarks.

7731
06:15:42,520 --> 06:15:44,760
Because everything looked so similar.

7732
06:15:45,100 --> 06:15:47,420
Because it was not different biomes.

7733
06:15:47,440 --> 06:15:48,700
It was like...

7734
06:15:48,700 --> 06:15:49,160
Um...

7735
06:15:49,160 --> 06:15:49,920
It was like...

7736
06:15:49,920 --> 06:15:50,740
Literally...

7737
06:15:51,260 --> 06:15:52,680
Which were the landmarks.

7738
06:15:52,680 --> 06:15:54,420
I couldn't figure out what the landmarks were.

7739
06:15:54,680 --> 06:15:55,300
Like...

7740
06:15:55,300 --> 06:15:56,000
To...

7741
06:15:56,000 --> 06:15:56,080
To...

7742
06:15:56,080 --> 06:15:57,400
To differentiate.

7743
06:15:58,320 --> 06:15:58,960
Uh...

7744
06:15:58,960 --> 06:15:59,820
Um...

7745
06:15:59,820 --> 06:16:00,560
Like...

7746
06:16:00,560 --> 06:16:01,300
Where I was.

7747
06:16:03,080 --> 06:16:04,780
But it is...

7748
06:16:04,780 --> 06:16:05,880
It was definitely...

7749
06:16:06,560 --> 06:16:07,720
It was definitely...

7750
06:16:07,720 --> 06:16:08,120
I would...

7751
06:16:08,120 --> 06:16:12,300
I would think the creature design in chapter 2 was a lot more interesting.

7752
06:16:12,540 --> 06:16:13,160
And...

7753
06:16:13,820 --> 06:16:14,140
Uh...

7754
06:16:14,140 --> 06:16:14,580
Um...

7755
06:16:14,580 --> 06:16:16,780
The combos too were...

7756
06:16:16,780 --> 06:16:17,420
Were...

7757
06:16:17,420 --> 06:16:20,140
It was a lot of different diverse combos and stuff.

7758
06:16:20,380 --> 06:16:21,740
I definitely got a lot better.

7759
06:16:22,060 --> 06:16:24,940
I think I got a lot better playing this game.

7760
06:16:25,100 --> 06:16:25,980
I think I got a lot better playing this game.

7761
06:16:26,000 --> 06:16:29,200
Yeah, I improved a lot.

7762
06:16:33,600 --> 06:16:35,780
Alright, let's hit the beginning of chapter 3.

7763
06:16:36,880 --> 06:16:38,860
I want to watch the beginning of chapter 3.

7764
06:16:39,820 --> 06:16:41,440
White Snow Ice Code.

7765
06:16:50,780 --> 06:16:52,140
Is this a snow map?

7766
06:17:11,940 --> 06:17:14,240
I miss... I used to be able to...

7767
06:17:16,420 --> 06:17:18,260
do Chinese calligraphy.

7768
06:17:20,240 --> 06:17:21,940
I used to take classes for it.

7769
06:17:43,350 --> 06:17:45,410
I think it's like... I think it's like...

7770
06:17:45,410 --> 06:17:47,610
your parents would... my parents would like...

7771
06:17:47,610 --> 06:17:48,670
Yeah, my parents would...

7772
06:17:48,670 --> 06:17:50,690
take me to like drawing classes.

7773
06:17:50,830 --> 06:17:53,570
And in one of them, we would have like Chinese calligraphy.

7774
06:17:55,330 --> 06:17:55,850
What?

7775
06:17:58,950 --> 06:17:59,990
Another baby?

7776
06:18:01,670 --> 06:18:03,470
Baby 3.0.

7777
06:18:03,470 --> 06:18:03,530
Oh.

7778
06:18:06,470 --> 06:18:07,230
It's the Buddha.

7779
06:18:19,280 --> 06:18:20,400
Wait, how did I get here?

7780
06:18:25,280 --> 06:18:25,680
Okay.

7781
06:18:28,720 --> 06:18:29,680
Alright, get over here.

7782
06:18:32,020 --> 06:18:33,240
Okay, no, don't go anywhere.

7783
06:18:34,400 --> 06:18:35,160
Not like that.

7784
06:18:36,820 --> 06:18:38,040
I said that as a joke.

7785
06:18:38,280 --> 06:18:39,900
I didn't think he would actually get over here.

7786
06:18:42,900 --> 06:18:43,660
Alright, nice.

7787
06:18:44,460 --> 06:18:45,220
Okay, wow.

7788
06:18:45,220 --> 06:18:46,360
He actually...

7789
06:18:46,360 --> 06:18:48,480
He actually got over here.

7790
06:18:48,740 --> 06:18:50,220
I was very surprised.

7791
06:18:50,380 --> 06:18:51,020
He did that.

7792
06:18:55,360 --> 06:18:56,740
That was a joke.

7793
06:18:56,860 --> 06:18:57,100
Wait.

7794
06:18:57,640 --> 06:18:58,480
There he is.

7795
06:18:59,600 --> 06:19:00,460
There he is.

7796
06:19:00,540 --> 06:19:00,900
There's...

7797
06:19:02,480 --> 06:19:03,360
He's just there.

7798
06:19:05,900 --> 06:19:06,420
Oh.

7799
06:19:07,600 --> 06:19:08,460
Where do I go?

7800
06:19:12,920 --> 06:19:14,240
Okay, it's not snow?

7801
06:19:15,020 --> 06:19:16,640
I thought this would be a snow area.

7802
06:19:16,640 --> 06:19:17,200
Oh, okay.

7803
06:19:17,380 --> 06:19:18,140
We go this way.

7804
06:19:19,040 --> 06:19:20,280
Alright, we gotta...

7805
06:19:20,920 --> 06:19:21,900
He looks older?

7806
06:19:22,100 --> 06:19:23,240
No, that's just my costume.

7807
06:19:23,800 --> 06:19:24,740
That's just my outfit.

7808
06:19:28,550 --> 06:19:28,950
Okay.

7809
06:19:30,050 --> 06:19:31,030
We go this way.

7810
06:19:32,530 --> 06:19:33,490
Oh, there's the snow.

7811
06:19:35,370 --> 06:19:36,170
There it is.

7812
06:19:38,750 --> 06:19:39,430
Oh, hey.

7813
06:19:40,090 --> 06:19:40,930
There he is too.

7814
06:19:42,130 --> 06:19:42,830
Oh sh...

7815
06:19:42,830 --> 06:19:43,510
What are you...

7816
06:19:43,510 --> 06:19:44,090
Oh my god!

7817
06:19:45,190 --> 06:19:46,070
What are you?

7818
06:19:46,090 --> 06:19:47,270
Are you also a bat?

7819
06:19:49,230 --> 06:19:50,250
Oh my god.

7820
06:19:51,670 --> 06:19:53,530
There's multiple bat creatures?

7821
06:19:53,930 --> 06:19:54,230
Wait.

7822
06:19:54,290 --> 06:19:54,750
What is he?

7823
06:19:56,030 --> 06:19:57,110
A scion bat.

7824
06:19:57,650 --> 06:19:58,770
Unforced spear in hand.

7825
06:19:58,930 --> 06:19:59,790
Clothes and simple guard.

7826
06:19:59,910 --> 06:20:00,830
Humble did he stand.

7827
06:20:01,010 --> 06:20:01,510
Deep woods.

7828
06:20:01,750 --> 06:20:03,530
A world of white.

7829
06:20:03,610 --> 06:20:04,830
A perfect hunting in sight.

7830
06:20:06,090 --> 06:20:06,610
Oh.

7831
06:20:06,810 --> 06:20:07,790
That's another bat.

7832
06:20:08,430 --> 06:20:09,410
Oh, it's like...

7833
06:20:09,410 --> 06:20:10,290
It's like different regions.

7834
06:20:11,550 --> 06:20:12,570
Just bat bat.

7835
06:20:12,810 --> 06:20:13,770
It's not mad bat.

7836
06:20:13,830 --> 06:20:14,790
He's just regular bat.

7837
06:20:15,370 --> 06:20:15,890
Oh.

7838
06:20:16,710 --> 06:20:17,230
That's another bat.

7839
06:20:18,170 --> 06:20:19,070
He's just...

7840
06:20:19,070 --> 06:20:20,290
He's just a regular bat.

7841
06:20:22,130 --> 06:20:23,230
He's bat bat.

7842
06:20:24,830 --> 06:20:26,210
Where is the incense?

7843
06:20:26,690 --> 06:20:28,010
I want to head to an incense area.

7844
06:20:30,250 --> 06:20:31,270
Just a bat.

7845
06:20:33,310 --> 06:20:34,130
Bat squared.

7846
06:20:36,970 --> 06:20:37,570
Oh.

7847
06:20:38,530 --> 06:20:39,630
Is that another bat?

7848
06:20:39,970 --> 06:20:40,590
Hello bat.

7849
06:20:40,710 --> 06:20:41,210
Oh sh...

7850
06:20:42,610 --> 06:20:43,910
He slapped me.

7851
06:20:44,250 --> 06:20:45,890
No bats can slap me.

7852
06:20:46,030 --> 06:20:47,150
Only I slap.

7853
06:20:47,230 --> 06:20:47,710
That's right.

7854
06:20:47,750 --> 06:20:48,210
Get down.

7855
06:20:48,450 --> 06:20:49,610
I'll fly swat you down.

7856
06:20:50,550 --> 06:20:52,390
I'm going to get my electric tennis racket.

7857
06:20:53,310 --> 06:20:53,910
Bzzz.

7858
06:20:56,810 --> 06:20:59,070
I'll grab my electric tennis racket.

7859
06:21:01,610 --> 06:21:02,730
I'll zap you.

7860
06:21:03,330 --> 06:21:04,530
Snow hill path.

7861
06:21:04,870 --> 06:21:05,110
Wait.

7862
06:21:05,150 --> 06:21:05,990
There's regular bats.

7863
06:21:06,670 --> 06:21:09,930
What the fuck is this Pluto, Pluto goofy scenario?

7864
06:21:10,470 --> 06:21:11,770
There's regular bats.

7865
06:21:12,370 --> 06:21:14,550
How did those bats turn into that bat?

7866
06:21:16,130 --> 06:21:17,210
Is there a bat here?

7867
06:21:17,210 --> 06:21:17,590
Is there a bat hierarchy?

7868
06:21:19,030 --> 06:21:20,150
Oh yeah.

7869
06:21:20,730 --> 06:21:23,070
You actually have one?

7870
06:21:23,310 --> 06:21:24,710
I used to live in Asia.

7871
06:21:24,830 --> 06:21:25,030
Yeah.

7872
06:21:25,230 --> 06:21:27,490
That's like literally like mandatory.

7873
06:21:29,150 --> 06:21:34,290
When you live in Asia you needed an electric tennis racket.

7874
06:21:36,950 --> 06:21:42,710
The bat society is literally required.

7875
06:21:46,290 --> 06:21:47,730
I like this map.

7876
06:21:48,050 --> 06:21:48,850
I like this map.

7877
06:21:48,870 --> 06:21:50,410
I already like this map a lot more.

7878
06:21:52,270 --> 06:21:53,230
All right.

7879
06:21:53,270 --> 06:21:53,890
Let's see.

7880
06:21:53,990 --> 06:21:57,870
Let's get the raging sandstorm.

7881
06:21:58,050 --> 06:21:59,150
And then do I have enough?

7882
06:21:59,390 --> 06:21:59,730
No.

7883
06:21:59,810 --> 06:22:01,370
I need more cold iron leaves.

7884
06:22:01,950 --> 06:22:03,230
I wonder if I could buy that.

7885
06:22:03,470 --> 06:22:04,850
Can I buy cold iron leaves?

7886
06:22:05,190 --> 06:22:06,570
Oh, I can craft weapons too.

7887
06:22:08,970 --> 06:22:09,930
Oh, 66%.

7888
06:22:11,470 --> 06:22:11,950
Okay.

7889
06:22:11,970 --> 06:22:12,450
I need to sell.

7890
06:22:13,450 --> 06:22:15,150
Uh, store.

7891
06:22:15,270 --> 06:22:15,470
Bye.

7892
06:22:16,950 --> 06:22:17,430
Uh.

7893
06:22:18,030 --> 06:22:18,510
Uh.

7894
06:22:18,510 --> 06:22:18,850
Uh.

7895
06:22:18,850 --> 06:22:19,390
Um.

7896
06:22:21,210 --> 06:22:22,230
Oh, there you go.

7897
06:22:22,350 --> 06:22:22,750
Okay.

7898
06:22:22,950 --> 06:22:24,410
Uh, I need two.

7899
06:22:26,690 --> 06:22:29,650
Okay and then I need to sell.

7900
06:22:30,550 --> 06:22:31,370
Oh, sell.

7901
06:22:34,210 --> 06:22:37,750
The gold reach beads once perched on the roof of a Buddha.

7902
06:22:37,830 --> 06:22:39,990
Maybe it can be exchanged for something valuable.

7903
06:22:40,210 --> 06:22:40,770
Man.

7904
06:22:40,870 --> 06:22:42,510
I'm a I'm a bad monkey.

7905
06:22:44,610 --> 06:22:48,410
I grave robbed this beautiful...

7906
06:22:48,410 --> 06:22:48,830
Oh, there.

7907
06:22:48,830 --> 06:22:51,410
A humble offering to the Buddha.

7908
06:22:51,630 --> 06:22:53,530
Anyway, I'm gonna sell it.

7909
06:22:55,670 --> 06:22:57,130
I'm a bad monkey.

7910
06:23:00,510 --> 06:23:01,370
That's right.

7911
06:23:01,830 --> 06:23:04,150
I'm a bad boy.

7912
06:23:05,470 --> 06:23:07,670
I need more will.

7913
06:23:09,630 --> 06:23:12,230
Okay, we have to farm will later.

7914
06:23:14,610 --> 06:23:16,770
It's in a character, honestly.

7915
06:23:18,830 --> 06:23:20,010
We're gonna call it here.

7916
06:23:20,290 --> 06:23:21,030
That was fun.

7917
06:23:21,950 --> 06:23:24,950
I did not expect to stream that long today.

7918
06:23:25,830 --> 06:23:28,030
I mean, we're selling...

7919
06:23:28,030 --> 06:23:28,650
That's true.

7920
06:23:28,870 --> 06:23:30,630
That's true, but you know...

7921
06:23:30,630 --> 06:23:33,990
If I was a good monkey, I wouldn't ask for money.

7922
06:23:35,550 --> 06:23:38,370
But I'm a bad monkey.

7923
06:23:41,470 --> 06:23:45,430
To be fair, Xu Meng is a pretty bad monkey.

7924
06:23:46,830 --> 06:23:48,610
He's the bad boy.

7925
06:23:50,150 --> 06:23:51,190
But yeah.

7926
06:23:51,350 --> 06:23:52,450
That was really fun.

7927
06:23:52,830 --> 06:23:53,990
I hope you guys enjoyed.

7928
06:23:54,310 --> 06:23:58,170
This was definitely a lot longer playthrough than I expected today.

7929
06:23:59,390 --> 06:24:00,870
But I definitely...

7930
06:24:00,870 --> 06:24:02,130
I really enjoyed this game.

7931
06:24:02,330 --> 06:24:04,310
I definitely enjoyed this game a lot.

7932
06:24:04,530 --> 06:24:05,870
I love going through.

7933
06:24:06,050 --> 06:24:07,070
I think I might play...

7934
06:24:07,070 --> 06:24:09,230
I definitely will play with the Chinese...

7935
06:24:09,230 --> 06:24:12,990
The Chinese dub for the future playthrough.

7936
06:24:13,610 --> 06:24:14,590
Just because like...

7937
06:24:14,590 --> 06:24:16,890
I feel like dialogue-wise...

7938
06:24:16,890 --> 06:24:18,810
I think like having English dialogue...

7939
06:24:19,630 --> 06:24:22,490
Doesn't really matter as much.

7940
06:24:24,010 --> 06:24:24,770
And...

7941
06:24:24,770 --> 06:24:27,170
Because the most important plot points...

7942
06:24:27,170 --> 06:24:28,670
There is subtitles for it.

7943
06:24:28,830 --> 06:24:29,730
But like...

7944
06:24:29,730 --> 06:24:31,150
I feel like immersive-wise...

7945
06:24:31,150 --> 06:24:33,670
The Chinese dub does feel a lot...

7946
06:24:33,670 --> 06:24:34,750
Like immersive.

7947
06:24:34,950 --> 06:24:37,190
Like into the story and the...

7948
06:24:37,810 --> 06:24:38,270
And...

7949
06:24:39,530 --> 06:24:41,210
And I think like the way...

7950
06:24:41,210 --> 06:24:43,290
The intonations they speak...

7951
06:24:43,510 --> 06:24:46,010
Heavily reminds me of like...

7952
06:24:46,810 --> 06:24:48,050
Old classic plays.

7953
06:24:48,670 --> 06:24:49,750
Back then.

7954
06:24:49,930 --> 06:24:50,610
So like...

7955
06:24:50,610 --> 06:24:51,670
It definitely reminds me...

7956
06:24:51,670 --> 06:24:53,410
Like those like classic TV shows...

7957
06:24:54,050 --> 06:24:55,410
That talks about like...

7958
06:24:55,410 --> 06:24:58,110
Like things that happened around this time.

7959
06:24:58,530 --> 06:24:59,690
Like it just reminds me...

7960
06:24:59,690 --> 06:25:00,930
The acting for it and everything.

7961
06:25:01,110 --> 06:25:02,950
I wonder if they got like famous...

7962
06:25:02,950 --> 06:25:05,210
Chinese actors and actresses...

7963
06:25:05,210 --> 06:25:06,530
For the voice acting.

7964
06:25:06,790 --> 06:25:07,250
I wonder.

7965
06:25:07,990 --> 06:25:09,610
Because the voice acting is pretty...

7966
06:25:09,610 --> 06:25:10,350
Pretty good.

7967
06:25:10,830 --> 06:25:12,250
So I'm just like thinking...

7968
06:25:12,250 --> 06:25:13,270
Yeah, the Chinese...

7969
06:25:13,270 --> 06:25:14,050
Chinese operas.

7970
06:25:14,690 --> 06:25:16,170
Yeah, that's what it reminds me of.

7971
06:25:16,990 --> 06:25:18,030
Listening to it.

7972
06:25:18,030 --> 06:25:20,710
And it definitely feels more immersive.

7973
06:25:21,090 --> 06:25:22,270
I feel like...

7974
06:25:23,730 --> 06:25:24,810
I feel like...

7975
06:25:24,810 --> 06:25:25,530
I do...

7976
06:25:25,530 --> 06:25:26,730
I sort of do like the Chinese.

7977
06:25:26,950 --> 06:25:28,530
I think it's also because I sort of understand...

7978
06:25:28,530 --> 06:25:29,250
What they're saying too.

7979
06:25:29,470 --> 06:25:31,030
I mean when they get like super poetic...

7980
06:25:31,730 --> 06:25:33,530
When they start going like super poetic...

7981
06:25:33,530 --> 06:25:35,350
And classic Chinese literature...

7982
06:25:35,350 --> 06:25:36,100
Type of speaking...

7983
06:25:36,550 --> 06:25:37,530
I was like...

7984
06:25:37,530 --> 06:25:38,690
I don't know what they're saying.

7985
06:25:39,590 --> 06:25:40,770
Because I don't...

7986
06:25:40,770 --> 06:25:43,150
I don't recognize...

7987
06:25:43,150 --> 06:25:45,070
I don't recognize some of the words...

7988
06:25:45,070 --> 06:25:45,850
Because it's like old...

7989
06:25:45,850 --> 06:25:47,110
Old Chinese dialogue.

7990
06:25:47,710 --> 06:25:48,910
I'm just like...

7991
06:25:50,270 --> 06:25:52,470
I was like...

7992
06:25:54,870 --> 06:25:56,410
But then they were like...

7993
06:25:56,410 --> 06:25:58,290
But then they start saying like some...

7994
06:25:58,290 --> 06:26:00,790
And then I recognized some of the Chinese...

7995
06:26:00,790 --> 06:26:01,170
Chinese.

7996
06:26:01,430 --> 06:26:02,730
It's just when it gets super...

7997
06:26:02,730 --> 06:26:03,730
Like...

7998
06:26:03,730 --> 06:26:05,430
Like old dialect.

7999
06:26:05,470 --> 06:26:07,270
I would go like...

8000
06:26:08,970 --> 06:26:09,950
Yeah, it's like...

8001
06:26:09,950 --> 06:26:10,370
It's like...

8002
06:26:10,370 --> 06:26:11,570
Shakespeare English.

8003
06:26:11,730 --> 06:26:13,510
But a lot more complicated.

8004
06:26:14,590 --> 06:26:17,090
Because they're like new words that I don't know.

8005
06:26:21,290 --> 06:26:23,870
It's much harder than Shakespearean English.

8006
06:26:25,030 --> 06:26:29,270
And like the way they talk is also very similar to like...

8007
06:26:29,910 --> 06:26:30,910
The way...

8008
06:26:30,910 --> 06:26:33,350
Like how people would talk in the old...

8009
06:26:33,350 --> 06:26:33,890
Like...

8010
06:26:33,890 --> 06:26:35,230
At the...

8011
06:26:35,230 --> 06:26:36,190
In the old times too.

8012
06:26:36,390 --> 06:26:37,430
So it's very...

8013
06:26:37,430 --> 06:26:38,350
It's definitely very immersive.

8014
06:26:38,550 --> 06:26:39,550
I do enjoy it.

8015
06:26:39,670 --> 06:26:41,030
I think as somebody...

8016
06:26:43,490 --> 06:26:45,490
As somebody that like...

8017
06:26:45,490 --> 06:26:46,510
Grew up with...

8018
06:26:46,510 --> 06:26:46,770
Like...

8019
06:26:46,770 --> 06:26:47,010
Like...

8020
06:26:47,010 --> 06:26:47,070
Like...

8021
06:26:47,070 --> 06:26:47,990
From home and like...

8022
06:26:47,990 --> 06:26:49,290
Chinese like...

8023
06:26:49,290 --> 06:26:49,750
Literature.

8024
06:26:50,110 --> 06:26:51,390
Classic literature and stuff.

8025
06:26:51,610 --> 06:26:51,970
It's...

8026
06:26:51,970 --> 06:26:52,770
I...

8027
06:26:52,770 --> 06:26:53,510
I don't know.

8028
06:26:53,590 --> 06:26:53,910
It's just...

8029
06:26:53,910 --> 06:26:55,110
It just feels a little more...

8030
06:26:55,110 --> 06:26:55,610
Personal?

8031
06:26:55,750 --> 06:26:56,650
I guess for me?

8032
06:26:57,290 --> 06:26:59,090
So I definitely enjoy it a lot.

8033
06:26:59,450 --> 06:27:00,090
But yeah!

8034
06:27:00,290 --> 06:27:03,090
I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching.

8035
06:27:04,910 --> 06:27:05,390
And...

8036
06:27:05,390 --> 06:27:07,670
I definitely enjoyed it a lot.

8037
06:27:08,150 --> 06:27:08,630
And...

8038
06:27:08,630 --> 06:27:10,190
I can't wait to play on Saturday.

8039
06:27:12,010 --> 06:27:12,490
I...

8040
06:27:12,490 --> 06:27:12,890
I...

8041
06:27:12,890 --> 06:27:13,610
I don't know.

8042
06:27:13,670 --> 06:27:14,390
This game is really fun.

8043
06:27:15,010 --> 06:27:15,490
It's...

8044
06:27:17,070 --> 06:27:17,470
This game...

8045
06:27:18,010 --> 06:27:20,430
This game is so fun.

8046
06:27:20,630 --> 06:27:24,310
I'm really happy that the review...

8047
06:27:24,590 --> 06:27:27,490
Like I'm really happy that the hype was worth it.

8048
06:27:27,610 --> 06:27:31,050
Because this game has been like hyped for a long time.

8049
06:27:31,250 --> 06:27:34,610
But I was worried that it was like overhyped in a way.

8050
06:27:35,950 --> 06:27:36,550
And...

8051
06:27:37,070 --> 06:27:39,290
I was incredibly worried that...

8052
06:27:40,010 --> 06:27:42,010
You know, when games get overhyped...

8053
06:27:42,010 --> 06:27:43,490
It's not...

8054
06:27:45,290 --> 06:27:47,050
You get very disappointed.

8055
06:27:50,190 --> 06:27:50,950
So...

8056
06:27:50,950 --> 06:27:54,410
I am glad that it lived up to its hype.

8057
06:27:54,970 --> 06:27:56,890
And that...

8058
06:27:56,890 --> 06:27:59,270
For its very first game...

8059
06:27:59,270 --> 06:28:01,410
For its very first game?

8060
06:28:01,590 --> 06:28:02,710
From the studio?

8061
06:28:03,270 --> 06:28:03,890
That's...

8062
06:28:03,890 --> 06:28:06,610
This is a really good game for...

8063
06:28:06,610 --> 06:28:09,150
The first one they've ever developed.

8064
06:28:09,830 --> 06:28:10,590
Like...

8065
06:28:14,190 --> 06:28:14,950
I...

8066
06:28:14,950 --> 06:28:17,050
Would have never expected...

8067
06:28:17,050 --> 06:28:18,690
This to be their very first game.

8068
06:28:19,050 --> 06:28:19,790
So...

8069
06:28:19,790 --> 06:28:21,450
The studio...

8070
06:28:21,450 --> 06:28:22,070
I...

8071
06:28:22,070 --> 06:28:24,150
There's like huge expectations on it now.

8072
06:28:24,370 --> 06:28:26,050
For any of their future work.

8073
06:28:27,770 --> 06:28:28,510
Um...

8074
06:28:28,900 --> 06:28:29,270
And...

8075
06:28:29,780 --> 06:28:30,150
Honestly...

8076
06:28:30,150 --> 06:28:30,790
Like...

8077
06:28:30,790 --> 06:28:31,710
Uh...

8078
06:28:31,710 --> 06:28:33,450
I'm like just thinking like...

8079
06:28:33,450 --> 06:28:34,850
I do hope...

8080
06:28:34,850 --> 06:28:35,930
That they don't go...

8081
06:28:35,930 --> 06:28:36,850
The route...

8082
06:28:36,850 --> 06:28:37,570
Of a lot of...

8083
06:28:37,570 --> 06:28:38,330
Especially like...

8084
06:28:38,330 --> 06:28:39,530
Western AAA...

8085
06:28:39,700 --> 06:28:40,930
Game companies...

8086
06:28:40,930 --> 06:28:43,430
Where all they think about is...

8087
06:28:44,020 --> 06:28:44,390
Profit...

8088
06:28:44,390 --> 06:28:45,950
And releasing games...

8089
06:28:45,950 --> 06:28:46,870
Every year.

8090
06:28:47,150 --> 06:28:48,010
So I...

8091
06:28:48,010 --> 06:28:49,330
I do hope...

8092
06:28:49,330 --> 06:28:50,050
That...

8093
06:28:50,050 --> 06:28:50,710
Because like...

8094
06:28:50,710 --> 06:28:52,350
This game has been in development for...

8095
06:28:52,350 --> 06:28:53,530
A very long time.

8096
06:28:54,030 --> 06:28:55,270
And a lot of like...

8097
06:28:55,270 --> 06:28:57,490
Western AAA companies now...

8098
06:28:57,490 --> 06:28:58,210
They're all like...

8099
06:28:58,210 --> 06:28:59,610
Release games...

8100
06:28:59,610 --> 06:29:00,190
Fast...

8101
06:29:00,190 --> 06:29:00,650
Fast...

8102
06:29:00,650 --> 06:29:01,070
Fast...

8103
06:29:01,070 --> 06:29:01,530
Fast...

8104
06:29:01,530 --> 06:29:01,950
And...

8105
06:29:02,550 --> 06:29:03,150
Um...

8106
06:29:03,150 --> 06:29:03,850
And like...

8107
06:29:03,850 --> 06:29:04,970
There's a lot of bugs...

8108
06:29:04,970 --> 06:29:05,730
There's a lot of like...

8109
06:29:05,730 --> 06:29:06,470
Corn showers...

8110
06:29:06,470 --> 06:29:07,390
And everything...

8111
06:29:07,390 --> 06:29:08,110
And like...

8112
06:29:08,110 --> 06:29:09,630
The game quality...

8113
06:29:09,630 --> 06:29:10,330
Obviously...

8114
06:29:10,330 --> 06:29:11,390
Dips a lot.

8115
06:29:11,670 --> 06:29:13,250
Very similar to movies nowadays.

8116
06:29:13,630 --> 06:29:13,930
Like...

8117
06:29:13,930 --> 06:29:14,690
If you guys didn't know...

8118
06:29:14,690 --> 06:29:14,990
Like...

8119
06:29:15,950 --> 06:29:16,450
Movies...

8120
06:29:16,450 --> 06:29:18,070
Movie franchises...

8121
06:29:18,070 --> 06:29:18,810
Currently...

8122
06:29:18,810 --> 06:29:19,650
With CGI...

8123
06:29:19,650 --> 06:29:21,450
The quality dipped heavily...

8124
06:29:21,450 --> 06:29:22,510
Because like...

8125
06:29:22,510 --> 06:29:23,910
The CGI department...

8126
06:29:23,910 --> 06:29:24,670
Gets like...

8127
06:29:24,670 --> 06:29:25,330
Less than...

8128
06:29:25,330 --> 06:29:26,410
A few months...

8129
06:29:26,410 --> 06:29:27,830
To work on CGI...

8130
06:29:27,830 --> 06:29:28,650
For movies...

8131
06:29:28,650 --> 06:29:29,390
And then sometimes...

8132
06:29:29,390 --> 06:29:30,630
They have to do corrections...

8133
06:29:30,630 --> 06:29:31,530
Within a month...

8134
06:29:31,530 --> 06:29:32,010
And stuff...

8135
06:29:32,010 --> 06:29:32,570
So like...

8136
06:29:32,570 --> 06:29:34,030
It's very similar to how like...

8137
06:29:34,030 --> 06:29:35,450
Movies themselves...

8138
06:29:35,450 --> 06:29:37,110
Are also dipping in quality...

8139
06:29:37,110 --> 06:29:38,610
Because they just want to finish the movies...

8140
06:29:38,610 --> 06:29:39,030
Fast...

8141
06:29:39,030 --> 06:29:39,410
Fast...

8142
06:29:39,410 --> 06:29:39,810
Fast...

8143
06:29:39,810 --> 06:29:41,390
Instead of working on CGI...

8144
06:29:41,390 --> 06:29:42,250
For years...

8145
06:29:42,250 --> 06:29:42,470
Like...

8146
06:29:42,470 --> 06:29:42,970
Back then...

8147
06:29:42,970 --> 06:29:44,610
Some CGI would take like...

8148
06:29:44,610 --> 06:29:45,050
Years...

8149
06:29:45,050 --> 06:29:45,870
To develop...

8150
06:29:45,870 --> 06:29:46,370
Um...

8151
06:29:46,370 --> 06:29:47,590
And then movies would be in develop...

8152
06:29:47,590 --> 06:29:48,750
For a very long time...

8153
06:29:48,750 --> 06:29:49,650
But nowadays...

8154
06:29:49,650 --> 06:29:50,570
A lot of movies...

8155
06:29:50,570 --> 06:29:51,410
Are in develop...

8156
06:29:51,410 --> 06:29:52,190
Um...

8157
06:29:52,190 --> 06:29:53,590
Are developing...

8158
06:29:53,590 --> 06:29:54,330
Like...

8159
06:29:54,330 --> 06:29:55,910
Within a year...

8160
06:29:55,910 --> 06:29:56,670
Or like...

8161
06:29:56,670 --> 06:29:57,870
Within two years...

8162
06:29:57,870 --> 06:29:58,570
Which is not...

8163
06:29:58,570 --> 06:30:00,270
How it used to be done...

8164
06:30:00,270 --> 06:30:00,990
Back then...

8165
06:30:00,990 --> 06:30:01,930
And that's why CGI...

8166
06:30:01,930 --> 06:30:02,510
Back then...

8167
06:30:02,510 --> 06:30:03,090
Is like...

8168
06:30:03,090 --> 06:30:03,990
A lot better...

8169
06:30:03,990 --> 06:30:04,750
Versus now...

8170
06:30:04,750 --> 06:30:05,430
Sometimes...

8171
06:30:06,850 --> 06:30:07,450
Um...

8172
06:30:07,450 --> 06:30:08,650
And so like...

8173
06:30:08,650 --> 06:30:09,070
I...

8174
06:30:09,070 --> 06:30:09,370
I...

8175
06:30:09,370 --> 06:30:10,530
I do hope...

8176
06:30:10,530 --> 06:30:11,070
That...

8177
06:30:11,070 --> 06:30:11,910
After...

8178
06:30:11,910 --> 06:30:13,430
This game's success...

8179
06:30:13,430 --> 06:30:14,330
That...

8180
06:30:14,330 --> 06:30:15,450
The studio...

8181
06:30:15,450 --> 06:30:16,150
Will continue...

8182
06:30:16,150 --> 06:30:17,150
To take it's time...

8183
06:30:17,890 --> 06:30:18,230
Um...

8184
06:30:18,230 --> 06:30:19,130
Polishing...

8185
06:30:19,130 --> 06:30:20,010
Their games...

8186
06:30:20,010 --> 06:30:20,630
And stuff...

8187
06:30:20,630 --> 06:30:21,570
Um...

8188
06:30:21,570 --> 06:30:22,630
And like...

8189
06:30:22,630 --> 06:30:23,110
Uh...

8190
06:30:23,110 --> 06:30:24,030
And just like...

8191
06:30:24,030 --> 06:30:24,650
Take...

8192
06:30:24,650 --> 06:30:25,090
You know...

8193
06:30:25,090 --> 06:30:25,250
Like...

8194
06:30:25,250 --> 06:30:25,990
It took many years...

8195
06:30:25,990 --> 06:30:27,530
For Wukong to be finished...

8196
06:30:27,530 --> 06:30:28,310
So I hope...

8197
06:30:28,310 --> 06:30:28,570
Like...

8198
06:30:28,570 --> 06:30:29,370
In the future...

8199
06:30:29,370 --> 06:30:29,850
Like...

8200
06:30:29,850 --> 06:30:30,870
I don't mind waiting...

8201
06:30:30,870 --> 06:30:31,290
If like...

8202
06:30:31,290 --> 06:30:32,010
They make games...

8203
06:30:32,010 --> 06:30:33,330
Very similar like this...

8204
06:30:33,330 --> 06:30:34,150
Um...

8205
06:30:34,150 --> 06:30:35,210
And I hope that...

8206
06:30:35,210 --> 06:30:35,890
More...

8207
06:30:35,890 --> 06:30:37,110
Game companies...

8208
06:30:37,110 --> 06:30:37,890
Would also...

8209
06:30:37,890 --> 06:30:38,270

Stay hydrated...

8228
06:30:56,850 --> 06:30:57,510
Posture check...

8229
06:30:57,510 --> 06:30:58,430
Get up and move around...

8230
06:30:58,430 --> 06:30:59,650
To get that blood flowing...

8231
06:30:59,650 --> 06:31:00,930
And if you stay up for me...

8232
06:31:00,930 --> 06:31:01,630
Head to bed!
