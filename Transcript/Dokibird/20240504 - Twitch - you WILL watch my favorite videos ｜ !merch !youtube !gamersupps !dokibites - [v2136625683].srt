1
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,230
I was like, wait, wait a minute, I'm muted.

2
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,150
Hello everyone!

3
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,730
Oh my god, chat is cut out as well.

4
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,590
Guys, I'm so professional.

5
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,010
I didn't know.

6
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,730
Okay, give me a sec.

7
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,390
I gotta fix chat.

8
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,170
I gotta fix chat.

9
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,170
Give me a sec.

10
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,990
You're cut off a little.

11
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,370
Let me fix you guys.

12
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,930
There we go.

13
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,810
Hello everyone!

14
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,790
Alright, today I'm gonna be showing you guys...

15
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,970
I made a little playlist for you guys.

16
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,410
It's like back in the day when people make mixtapes and be like, please listen to my mixtape.

17
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,850
I made a little video.

18
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,650
I made a little, like, video playlist and I'm like, please watch my playlist.

19
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:36,970
Please.

20
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,530
I made this special Dragoon playlist.

21
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,190
Well, to be fair, this was my playlist.

22
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,550
I'll be like, that's funny and then I save it.

23
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,430
But then I'm like, this is my Doki playlist for the Dragoons.

24
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,470
So please watch my playlist.

25
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,770
The very important videos.

26
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,970
But welcome, welcome!

27
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,790
Welcome to my React channel that's on Twitch because I don't want to get in trouble with YouTube.

28
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,670
I'm now trying to re...

29
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,430
Some people were asking me, were like, oh, are you gonna re-upload this?

30
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,110
And I'm just like, I mean, I can try.

31
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,610
I don't...

32
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:20,710
Don't...

33
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:34,610
I'll see what's gonna happen when I re-upload it on, like, if I, like, upload the VOD on, like, on my VOD's channel and just see what happens to it.

34
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,250
So, like, you know, I can try.

35
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,090
See?

36
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,510
That's the worst...

37
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,710
I mean, it's just... I have three strikes, right?

38
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,030
So, like, if I get striked, at least I'll have two more strikes, you know?

39
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,950
Like, the first strike is just to test it out and see...

40
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,810
see what happens, you know?

41
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,430
At least not the main channel.

42
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,370
And technically, if you think about it, that means I have two channels.

43
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,450
So, like, that means I can have six strikes.

44
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,170
So, like, the more channels I get, the more chances I can have.

45
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:20,670
So, like, maybe I should just create another channel in case the VOD channels get a strike and I'll have another channel and that's, like, a whole new... three more strikes that I have.

46
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,010
Like, three more chances.

47
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,390
The five-minute move.

48
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,950
The strike leveling algorithm.

49
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,950
But welcome!

50
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,150
Welcome to my Twitch, everybody.

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,350
It's not gonna be, like, a...

52
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,550
I think, like, I'm not gonna be doing this a lot, obviously.

53
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,690
It's just, like, a special day today.

54
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:49,950
I just was... I wanted to be, like, let me show you my... I can finally, like, show you some videos that I've been, like, wanting to show you guys for a while now.

55
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,410
Because in the past, we had to, like, ask individually the channels to be, like, can I react to your videos?

56
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,390
Can I show your videos?

57
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,670
And they'll either not respond or just...

58
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,410
I don't know.

59
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,210
I guess not respond.

60
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,830
Thank

61
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,710
you!

62
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,970
I really appreciate it.

63
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,690
Thank you so much!

64
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,570
I almost forgot I was partnered on this... on my Twitch, guys.

65
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,710
It's been a while.

66
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,030
It's been a...

67
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:26,550
I usually use my... I realized when I was, like, setting things up on my Twitch channel I was, like, wow!

68
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,970
I was... I did not set up anything on my... I did not really set up anything for, like, solo streams on Twitch.

69
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,010
Because every time I streamed on Twitch, it's either for, like, Twitch rivals or...

70
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,030
Okay, it's usually for Twitch rivals.

71
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,610
So then when I was, like, setting everything up, I was, like, oh my god!

72
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,970
There's no, like... I don't know how...

73
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:59,250
I don't have any, like... By the way, By the way, I was like, wait, sorry if there's no alerts, because I'm scared of putting my alerts up right now, because I don't think... wait, I think I did mute it.

74
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,990
Let me see if I can... I'll put the Twitch alerts, because I was like, oh man, I don't know if I have... let me see.

75
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,150
Okay, there we go.

76
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,150
Okay, here we go.

77
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,550
That's good.

78
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,890
Okay, that's a good sign.

79
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,210
Alright, Twitch alerts are... I think Twitch alerts are muted.

80
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,550
I think.

81
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:30,890
So, that's why I was a little scared, because I didn't even, like, adjust my Twitch alerts, because I was like, oh no, is our alerts muted?

82
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,570
I don't know.

83
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,150
I haven't really figured it out yet.

84
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,250
Johnny Lacombe, thank you for 20 gifted subs.

85
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,650
Thank you, thank you.

86
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,190
Oh my god, Bacon, thank you for the 50 gifted subs.

87
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,730
Thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,830
I really appreciate it, guys.

89
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,110
Thank you so much.

90
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,690
Thank you so much.

91
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:57,110
I bet I'm, like, Twitch's favorite streamer, because I don't use up their bandwidth, but, like, I still have subs, so I'm, like...

92
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,210
They're like, give Toki Prite, dude.

93
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:13,250
She doesn't use up our bandwidth, but she still has people giving her money on Twitch.

94
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,870
Super cost-effective.

95
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,170
Super cost-effective.

96
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:18,850
Yeah.

97
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,890
We're gonna have to resize this alert.

98
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,110
Holy shit.

99
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,030
Alright, I'll play around with it one day.

100
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,210
And I realized, I was like, oh shit, I didn't even upload any, like, new emotes in here.

101
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,270
I'm so fucked, man.

102
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,390
I am so...

103
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:48,070
But, yes, I don't know if, like, Soundguy is alive, because, like, Soundguy, if you're here, I need you to message me on Discord, because your messages are gonna get drowned out in the regular.

104
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,850
Because I haven't, like, customized my chat in a way that I can see, like...

105
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,750
I can see mods easier.

106
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,210
I haven't done that yet.

107
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,230
There's a lot of things I haven't done.

108
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,690
You guys are gonna figure it out.

109
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,650
There's a lot...

110
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,130
There's multiple things that I haven't done, guys.

111
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:14,930
Okay.

112
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,390
Anyway.

113
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,090
Anyway.

114
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,750
Also, another update.

115
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,950
Also, another update for you guys.

116
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:28,070
You remember how I said, like, oh, next week, I'm going to have a rest week?

117
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,710
Well, about that...

118
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:38,370
About that, it might not be a rest week anymore, because I sort of, like, said yes to a lot of things.

119
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,870
And I looked at my calendar, and I was like, oh, it's this week.

120
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,090
I was just like...

121
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,810
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,270
I was like...

123
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,070
Wait a minute.

124
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,490
They're off for, like, next week.

125
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,350
Oh, no.

126
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,550
I couldn't help it.

127
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,390
Okay.

128
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,150
When you find out what they are, they're pretty exciting.

129
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,450
It's pretty exciting things.

130
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,210
Okay.

131
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,690
To be fair, this entire month...

132
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,190
Month of May, I'm so fucked.

133
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,090
I'm actually...

134
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,950
The month of May, I sort of...

135
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:18,650
I messed up a little bit for the month of May, because I said yes to a lot of things.

136
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,250
I messed up a little bit for the month of May, because I said yes to a lot of things.

137
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:30,030
And then I looked at my calendar, and I was like, oh, at one point, there's going to be, like, a back-to-back event for one of the days.

138
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,610
And I was like, oh, no.

139
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,570
But, like, I'm getting my name out there.

140
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,750
Yahoo.

141
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,790
No rest for content creators.

142
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,550
Let's fucking go.

143
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,690
All right.

144
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,810
Thank you for the 100 bitties.

145
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,290
Thank you.

146
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,930
Thank you.

147
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,770
Anyway, guys, let me show you guys the first video.

148
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,110
If it's, like, let me know if it's, like, too late.

149
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,750
I haven't figured out my Twitch Rivals team yet, by the way.

150
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,470
I saw, like...

151
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,710
So, basically, like, okay, so, like, there's, like, how I figure...

152
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:14,390
Like, every time I would, like, so go on, like, there's a Twitch Rivals schedule, and I look at it ever so often.

153
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,310
And then if there's something that interests me, I just press express interest.

154
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:17,530
Okay.

155
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,110
And then, like, my Twitch guy would message me.

156
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,530
I was, like, oh, we saw you express interest for this.

157
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,550
Do you actually want to do it?

158
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,550
And I'll be, like, yeah.

159
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,310
Yeah, sure.

160
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,710
Like, you want to be captain?

161
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,630
I'll be, like, oh, yeah, sure.

162
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,610
So, now I have to figure out my teammates, because I haven't really figured out my teammates yet.

163
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,850
There's, like, not just this Twitch Rivals.

164
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,530
I'm in another Twitch Rivals in two weeks.

165
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,030
Two weeks as well.

166
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,110
Because I'll be, like, I'll just be, like, do you want to do this?

167
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,630
I'll be, like, yeah, sure.

168
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,730
And then my DMs will be, like, do you want to participate in this tournament?

169
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,970
I'll be, like, oh, cool.

170
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,450
Yeah, sure.

171
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,390
And then I'll be, like, do you want to do this?

172
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,650
Oh, that's cool.

173
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,430
That's pretty cool.

174
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,850
Yeah, sure.

175
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,090
And then I look at my calendar, and it's, like, tournament, tournament, event, tournament.

176
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,110
I'll be, like, oh.

177
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,290
Maybe not.

178
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,050
No more.

179
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,850
Yeah, sure.

180
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,090
Good.

181
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,070
Thank you for the rate.

182
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,670
Thank you.

183
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,370
Thank you.

184
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,310
I really appreciate it.

185
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,370
Thank you so much.

186
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,350
Yeah.

187
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,790
So now I'm, like, I need to stop saying, yeah, sure, to things.

188
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,610
And then the next day, someone's going to.

189
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,830
And then I say that to myself.

190
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,250
But then the day after, someone's going to be, like, do you want to do this?

191
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,270
I'm, like, yeah, sure.

192
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,550
Sure.

193
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,450
So it just never stops.

194
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,590
Someone let me off this wild ride.

195
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,630
No, not June.

196
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,070
Okay.

197
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,230
June might be a little wild, but May is very wild.

198
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,050
May is, like, oh.

199
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,650
This month is, like, oh.

200
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,110
All right.

201
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,090
I'll show you guys.

202
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,570
I'll show you guys the first video, guys.

203
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,270
All right.

204
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,650
So I saw this and I thought it was really funny.

205
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,950
There's a new crab game that's, like, Dark Souls related.

206
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,470
Let me know if it's too loud or not.

207
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,910
Bright, colorful souls like game and thought, this is too happy.

208
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,850
We need more dark and mysterious souls like games.

209
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,350
There just isn't enough out there.

210
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,430
They're not fellow gamer.

211
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,170
We have added a new feature to another crab's treasure.

212
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,630
Dark Souls like mode.

213
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,210
Yeah.

214
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,710
Because it's too happy.

215
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,250
Yeah.

216
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,530
All the vibrant colors of the game and replace it with...

217
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,450
I was sort of, like...

218
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,950
I've been wanting to play this game for a bit because, like, it's basically, like, a happier version of Dark Souls.

219
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,090
So...

220
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,270
And you play, like, a cra...

221
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,030
You play a crab.

222
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,150
So...

223
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:01,650
So...

224
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:02,950
So it's just...

225
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,110
It's just a happier version of Dark Souls.

226
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,770
I've been wanting to try out for a bit because, like, it looks, you know, not depressing.

227
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,130
Anyway, they added depression mode.

228
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,450
And dark color scheme.

229
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,050
Does Krill appear too happy?

230
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,310
Let's remove that sparkle in his eyes in determination for adventure.

231
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,130
In Dark Souls like mode, Krill will become depressed.

232
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,790
Oh, look at him.

233
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,310
Not a hope in sight.

234
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,530
Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?

235
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,550
If Krill's depression starts to burn your experience, Dark Souls like mode unlocks a new costume.

236
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,450
You might recognize it for Redacted Redacted Copyright Strike Redacted.

237
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,330
This costume will hide Krill's defeated face.

238
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,610
So we're going to mod that.

239
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:44,070
Dark Souls like mode also turns all levels into a poison swamp because it's not a real Souls-like game without one.

240
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,750
Look at that poiseony goodness.

241
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,970
We also added, Anor Londo.

242
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,550
Fuck it.

243
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,030
OK, I got- OK, I got this ad on my shorts.

244
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,590
I was like, is that Markiplier?

245
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:09,550
But then- OK, but then, like- OK, OK, I just need you guys to know.

246
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,770
I got this ad while scrolling through the chat.

247
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:28,710
I'm walking through YouTube Shorts and like the plot twist is that not only is that character based off of Markiplier, but it's furry Markiplier.

248
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,610
I wouldn't get any closer if I were you.

249
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,550
I'm not saying.

250
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,370
By the way, if anyone wants to download this game, feel free.

251
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,330
I'll bite you, but I'm not saying it either.

252
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,710
I was like, wait, this is like, it's a dating sim.

253
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:58,790
Instead of dating like the human versions of them, you're dating the animals?

254
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,710
But like, they're not, the thing is...

255
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,550
The thing is, they're not like...

256
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,330
They're actual animals.

257
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,130
Like, it's not even furry anymore.

258
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,670
They're actually animals.

259
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,890
And I was like, oh, this is...

260
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,890
I was like, wait...

261
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,170
That's not...

262
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,490
I was just like, wait a minute.

263
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,470
There's something...

264
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,470
Anyway, it's called Blush Blush.

265
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,550
Can somebody please play this game for me and then report back?

266
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,230
Can someone play this game and report back to me?

267
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,710
Oh, yeah.

268
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,770
Also, I really want to show you guys this video.

269
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,070
Why would we do that?

270
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,590
I want to show you guys this one.

271
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,650
This has been like...

272
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,970
This lives rent-free in my mind sometimes.

273
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,110
This video.

274
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,110
This is one of my favorite covers.

275
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,310
This was made 4 years ago.

276
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,550
I love Spongebob Vocaloid.

277
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,150
There's one with Reaper from Overwatch.

278
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,610
And then there's one...

279
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,130
There's so many of Spongebob.

280
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,430
And then there's like Cartman Vocaloids too.

281
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,410
I listen to this cover like once a year.

282
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,230
It's not just me.

283
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,790
It's not AI.

284
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,650
It's Vocaloid.

285
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,510
It's different.

286
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,450
You uncultured.

287
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,370
It's swine.

288
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,610
Look at him go.

289
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,830
Look at Squidward go.

290
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,650
Look at the sea crab.

291
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,690
He lists all the sources of videos.

292
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,650
Okay, Spongebob and Squidward, Vocaloid, walked.

293
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,310
So like, what was it?

294
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,930
The fucking AI rap covers could run?

295
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,330
Go Squidward, go!

296
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,330
He's so kawaii!

297
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,850
The covers!

298
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,310
Wait, you're so right!

299
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,630
Okay, wait, wait, wait, okay.

300
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,930
I don't know if you guys... Okay, I need to...

301
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,210
Oh my god, Plankton!

302
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:17,890
Look at him go!

303
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,810
You guys can't see him.

304
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,290
He's over there on the right.

305
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,310
I'm covering him up.

306
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,490
Have you guys seen the presidential covers?

307
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,430
The AI songs!

308
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,380
Go Plankton, go!

309
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,820
Okay, but like... This is like... Okay, I need to show you guys the OG.

310
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,140
I need you guys... I need to show you guys the OG.

311
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,700
We're at the OG MMD, the rabbit hole.

312
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,100
I think it's this one.

313
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,920
It has to be this one, right?

314
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,840
This has to be like... I think this is the OG.

315
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
This is the rabbit hole of where I...

316
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,290
This was seven years ago, by the way.

317
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,490
Look at him go!

318
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,410
So beautiful!

319
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,510
He's so kawaii!

320
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,970
This was... This was my rabbit hole.

321
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,460
My Reaper can't be this kawaii.

322
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,720
Nioh, thank you for the hundred pennies!

323
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,500
Thank you, thank you!

324
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,560
Thank

325
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,730
you!

326
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,410
Thank you!

327
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,450
Thank you!

328
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,110
My

329
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,680
God!

330
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,440
Okay, I was speaking of this... Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

331
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,400
Speaking of this...

332
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,220
Have you guys heard of the... The Toons Drag Race?

333
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,700
Wait, Toons of Drag Race.

334
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,060
Have you guys seen that?

335
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,460
Oh my God, wait.

336
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,400
Okay, I think it's this one.

337
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,020
What was it?

338
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,180
Who is Oc... Wait, who is... Cartoons Drag Race.

339
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,740
Okay, I... That like popped up on my Twitter feed.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
And I... I...

341
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,320
That is so fucking stupid.

342
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,320
The first season of Cartoons Drag Race has...

343
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,180
Okay, no!

344
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,080
Does anyone have the actual YouTube video?

345
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,960
It's on TikTok!

346
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,440
So like, nobody has the actual car... video!

347
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,200
Please, re-upload it on...

348
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,760
Please, I'm making... I'm making YouTube channel!

349
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,380
Okay, Drag Race Cartoons.

350
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,260
Alright, let me see if I can find it.

351
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,340
No!

352
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,340
Guys, I can't react to it because nobody...

353
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,520
He didn't make a YouTube channel.

354
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
He didn't make a...

355
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,700
We're saying...

356
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,380
No, it's so funny though!

357
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,680
You don't understand!

358
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,340
Also, here's one with... with our boys.

359
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,360
Oh my...

360
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,620
Sorry!

361
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,680
Oh my God, look at his legs!

362
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,520
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

363
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,420
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

364
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,700
Look at Soldier's fucking...

365
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,480
You wish!

366
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,160
You...

367
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,340
That's why we call him Legs, guys!

368
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,480
This is exactly why we call him Legs!

369
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,700
I can't hear Miguel.

370
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,740
This is my rabbit hole.

371
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,180
Overwatch MMDs.

372
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,340
Are there people?

373
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,540
Other people?

374
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,040
They...

375
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,860
Other people?

376
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
They watch the Overwatch...

377
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,960
They watch Overwatch?

378
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,120
Different Overwatch videos?

379
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,000
I watch this.

380
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,320
They...

381
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,460
They go to a different site for their Overwatch videos.

382
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,380
I just watch Overwatch MMDs.

383
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,340
Oh my God.

384
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,200
Oh my God!

385
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,820
For all that running, though.

386
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,860
It paid off for Soldier!

387
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,780
My Overwatch goes to another school.

388
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,880
Ah, ah, ah...

389
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,120
All I'm saying...

390
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,880
All I'm saying... is that...

391
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:27,980
All I'm saying...

392
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:27,980
is that...

393
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
I can't do this.

394
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,800
Okay.

395
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,300
Okay.

396
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,160
All right, let me...

397
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,140
Oh, and then there's this one!

398
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,580
Oh, here's a Cartman version.

399
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,280
Let's see.

400
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,680
Where is it?

401
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,360
I'm trying to find the Cartman version.

402
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,160
Here you go.

403
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
Here's a Cartman AI.

404
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:15,360
They did like... I found... I wanted to grab a hold of these covers where like they did like various... various like cartoon characters.

405
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,840
Bro!

406
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,280
He's a natural singer!

407
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,040
It's a singer!

408
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,840
There's a lot of them, by the way.

409
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,260
It's not just Cartman.

410
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,900
There's a Peter...

411
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,820
Oh my god!

412
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,300
There's a Peter Griffin one!

413
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

414
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,040
Wait, wait.

415
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,420
Let me show you guys the Peter Griffin one.

416
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,120
Peter Griffin.

417
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,080
AI.

418
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,860
Oh my god.

419
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,220
What is it?

420
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,360
It was a Steven Universe song.

421
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,740
What is this one?

422
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,540
Bro!

423
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
AI goes hard!

424
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,640
Bro!

425
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,550
Why do people like use AI unethically?

426
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,860
Why can't we do meme shit like this?

427
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,300
Bro!

428
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,200
Why can't we just do fun stuff?

429
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,880
Why do people have to ruin it?

430
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,840
Like...

431
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,180
It's so good!

432
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,520
Isn't it?

433
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,500
Isn't it over?

434
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,300
It's over.

435
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,880
Isn't it?

436
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,280
Isn't it?

437
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,260
Isn't it over?

438
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,820
You won.

439
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,940
And she chose you.

440
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,680
And she loved you.

441
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,860
And she's gone.

442
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,860
It's over.

443
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,940
Isn't it?

444
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,420
Why can't I move on?

445
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,320
War and glory.

446
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,340
Re tile in stone 3 vaime screams.

447
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,820
attention out in daylight.

448
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,380
attention out in daylight.

449
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,340
My potential.

450
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,400
My poten entered prevert experimental.

451
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,620
Who am I now in this world without her?

452
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,020
Who am I now in this world without her?

453
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,480
Petty and tall with her entire stomach.

454
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,060
Lois.

455
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,720
That's good for me though.

456
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,000
It's over, isn't it?

457
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,520
Isn't it?

458
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,940
Isn't it?

459
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,500
It's over, it's over, isn't it?

460
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,880
Isn't it?

461
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,560
Isn't it over?

462
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,920
You won, and she chose you, and she loved you, and she's gone!

463
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,080
It's over, isn't it?

464
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,760
Why can't I move on?

465
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,640
Sorry, I went into a rabbit hole.

466
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,920
I'm going through so many different rabbit holes right now.

467
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,840
I'm sorry guys, I'm getting off track.

468
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,220
Anyway, back to my playlist.

469
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,000
Anyway, back to the playlist that I fucking made for you guys.

470
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,060
Guess why I'm showing you guys all the fun videos I wanted to show you!

471
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,260
Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait.

472
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,920
Alright, to be fair, I'll give you guys some normal videos.

473
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,160
That wasn't the playlist.

474
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,180
No, no, no, no.

475
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,180
These are like videos I just went... I was like, oh my god.

476
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,260
I wanna... oh my god, I forgot about these videos too.

477
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,720
Anyway, here are like actual normal videos that I watched, by the way.

478
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,180
Here are some actual normal videos.

479
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,120
Okay, I'm gonna recommend you guys a channel that I've actually like really liked to watch ever so often.

480
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,780
And it's like a cooking channel.

481
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:19,260
But like, he does like cookbook reviews, but he does like gamer cookbook reviews.

482
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,160
And it's like really interesting.

483
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,080
Cause like, all... I always think like, who buys these types of cookbooks?

484
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,520
You know like those types of cookbooks where it's like gamer... gaming or anime or like TV show inspired.

485
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,680
And like, he does like those like reviews of those cookbooks.

486
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,720
Cause I always wonder who buys these.

487
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,220
Like, who the fuck...

488
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,960
You know, like, oh, family's visiting, let me make a...

489
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,900
Let me make an Assassin's Creed meal inspired.

490
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,220
Like...

491
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,240
Like dinner or something.

492
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,520
Yes!

493
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,660
It's me so hungry!

494
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,680
I just finished binging the Fallout TV show.

495
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay, this is like actually...

496
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,360
I thought it really captured the unique post-apocalyptic flavor of the games.

497
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,400
And it got me really nostalgic.

498
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,820
I really enjoy watching his channel whenever he does like updates.

499
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,520
Honestly, I'm surprised he only has 150k subscribers.

500
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,780
Because like, I actually really enjoy watching his videos and stuff.

501
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,640
So like...

502
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,200
So he has like all these like...

503
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,140
He has like cookbook reviews and stuff.

504
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,960
He would be like Bob's Burgers.

505
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,340
The Sonic Cookbook.

506
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,680
And like...

507
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
Oh, like Neopets Cookbook.

508
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,600
Uh...

509
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,740
The Rick and Morty...

510
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,720
Let's watch the Rick and Morty one.

511
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,700
Hey, put me over.

512
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,900
Come on!

513
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,140
With the pickle!

514
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,300
Boom!

515
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,920
Big reveal!

516
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,780
I turned myself into a pickle!

517
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm Pickle Miso!

518
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,260
Guys, you don't understand.

519
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,780
You don't have a high enough IQ to understand this.

520
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,560
Well, I hear Rick and Morty might be needing a new voice actor.

521
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,900
So, think of this as my audition.

522
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Come on, Cartoon Network!

523
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,660
If you have any...

524
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,360
Alright, we're gonna skip this.

525
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,680
This is a little cringe.

526
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,060
We're taking a look at Rick and Morty.

527
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,440
It's a little cringe!

528
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,860
The Pickle Cookbook by August Bragg and James Astley.

529
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:05,400
This book takes us along Rick and Morty's adventure through space and time with a focus on the funky alien foods they come across along the way.

530
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,640
I really dig the way they presented this cookbook.

531
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,720
Basically, for Morty's home economics school project, he decided to put together a cookbook of his family's favorite recipes.

532
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,940
Rick doesn't want Morty wasting his time on this silly school project since they gotta go on adventures.

533
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,400
So, what does he do?

534
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,960
Rick fills up the rest of the book himself.

535
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,200
It's so interesting because like some of the cookbooks, they're like really well designed with like pictures of the food.

536
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:36,260
Just like the show, it's crazy and wacky and it feels like there's something fun to expect after every page turned.

537
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,160
I really love the layout of the book.

538
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,100
I think it's the perfect balance of text and imagery.

539
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,720
Lots of fun flavor text to read and very close in tone to the dark humor of the show.

540
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,560
There are no F-bombs or anything.

541
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,920
But there are some mature lines.

542
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,780
There's a lot of leading jokes in there that's very on brand.

543
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,480
I also really like how the recipe pages are littered with illustrations and even screenshots from the show.

544
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,400
And the screenshots are usually lifted from the same episode that the recipe is inspired by which is a neat addition.

545
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,500
The food photos are awesome as well and I really like the extra details in the staging of the food.

546
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,000
Some photos have lab equipment in the background to make them look like a part of Rick's lab and some photos have the characters interacting with the food.

547
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:21,140
The abundant illustrations and attention to detail really makes this one of the most thematic and most fun cookbooks to look at.

548
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,000
Not all recipes have photos but in this case I don't even mind because there's so much other good content to supplement it.

549
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,940
The recipes themselves are based off of food from the show or are inspired by references made in the show.

550
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,660
It's not just generic recipes with names thrown on them.

551
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,580
They really tried to draw things along and there are a lot of fun and crazy attempts to make some real dishes out of these crazy things.

552
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,240
Really impressed by how much this cookbook raises.

553
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,600
Now that we've had a look-see, it's time to get trying.

554
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:55,000
Let's try to break this space time continuum by making some interdimensional glove from the Rick and Morty cookbook.

555
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,560
Now we can't do Rick and Morty food without paying tribute to the iconic Pickle Rick.

556
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,160
After all, Pickle Rick won the show its first Emmy, launched a thousand memes, and inspired a bunch of merch, including this one.

557
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,780
So to make Pickle Rick's transformation brand, we need to mix the ingredients.

558
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,300
Stir it for a few minutes until it's light.

559
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,680
Close the midst of this hot dog porch on some battered lids.

560
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,860
Close the midst of this hot dog porch on some battered lids.

561
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:24,560
In this recipe, cook the pork in a microwave for 15 seconds.

562
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,840
Don't let theiques cook thoroughly.

563
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,960
Keep stirring and heat the pot.

564
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,220
Mince the garlic.

565
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,420
As we can see, the garlic has been chopped.

566
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:33,800
Combine the sauce and sweet soy sauce.

567
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,780
The pork is ready to go.

568
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Now is the time to try the garlic.

569
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:59,800
And it's really interesting because like you know he was like obviously like if he can make it like that means I can make it technically and uh and then he gives like a review and be like which one I want which one is good or not.

570
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,140
The store-bought ones are just much less of a hassle you know but if you're really looking to make homemade ones then this is a pretty solid recipe.

571
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,900
I like how it's green screen so you don't see the pickle.

572
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,700
But these chili dogs are the ones I've been eyeing up.

573
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:18,340
They definitely passed the eye test but they passed the taste test with flying colors.

574
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,920
This is pretty dang delicious.

575
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,340
So yeah this is honestly like one this is like one of my favorite channels to watch.

576
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,340
It's like oh my god I was watching the one piece one and then holy shit why is that curry blue?

577
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,520
What the fuck it's blue!

578
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,720
And then he made the bacon pancakes right here I watched that one.

579
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,060
And then there's the...

580
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,120
Uh okay there's one that I saw that I was like...

581
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,620
Wait look at this.

582
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,360
Look!

583
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,420
It's that fucking it's the one piece turkey!

584
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,920
It's the one piece turkey it looks so okay this looks actually looks so fucking good though like look at that.

585
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,220
It's the one piece turkey!

586
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,220
That looks so good!

587
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,060
The meat's sick!

588
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:11,900
The meat's still dried.

589
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,880
For my second bite I tried to get more of the drumstick meat which was way more moist and tasted a lot better.

590
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,940
Don't worry he like has his recipe for it.

591
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,720
What the fuck there's an egg inside!

592
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,180
I already forgot there was an egg inside.

593
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,680
How did he make that?

594
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,620
Don't worry just subscribe to Me So Hungry.

595
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:37,720
The best part is he tells the recipe in the video so you actually don't have to buy the book like you can just follow the recipe in his video which...

596
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:51,130
But if you really want to support the publisher, you should buy the book.

597
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:02,390
But if you really want to support the publisher, you could also buy the book.

598
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,390
But the best part is that he gives a step-by-step guide in the video itself.

599
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,390
So I don't have to worry about trying to figure out the recipe.

600
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,970
Oh my god, I'm so hungry now looking at this.

601
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,470
See, I think it's this one, right?

602
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,350
No, that's the meat on the bone here.

603
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,310
Meat on the bone.

604
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,830
Oh,

605
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,670
it wasn't turkey, it was a chicken!

606
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,210
No, it was a chicken.

607
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,770
Why did you start with food videos?

608
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,410
No, we started off with like...

609
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,230
We definitely did not start with food videos.

610
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,630
I'm sorry to all the vegans and vegetarians that are watching this.

611
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,050
It's not that much work, to be honest.

612
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,510
You just cut a chicken in half.

613
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,810
I saw a Reaper dance.

614
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,030
He started with Vocaloid.

615
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,290
But not the Vocaloid you're expecting.

616
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,970
Knead it all together and then mix in the milky breadcrumbs and knead it again.

617
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,540
Now to assemble the drumsticks, you're gonna need one hard-boiled egg per chicken drumstick.

618
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,360
Take the layers of meat and grate it around a hard-boiled egg.

619
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,480
Oh, you use it to shape it!

620
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,640
I see!

621
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,860
Then warm your hands and then take the meat mixture and cover the drumstick and egg so it looks like one honking meat drumstick.

622
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,100
Just like in the anime.

623
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,500
When everything is assembled, bake the drumsticks in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 15-20 minutes.

624
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:01,620
If your drumstick still looks pale, I would raise the temp to 450 and then broil it for another 5-10 minutes to give it that nice brown color.

625
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,260
Which is what I did.

626
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,240
When done, you should have four nice plump meat on the roll.

627
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,100
If I wasn't so lazy, I'd do this.

628
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,040
God damn it!

629
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,820
If I wasn't a fucking streamer, I'd do this!

630
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,600
This is one of my favorite channels.

631
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm really happy whenever they have new episodes.

632
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,100
I was always like, time to watch!

633
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,580
But I feel like he's so high effort.

634
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,420
Like his...

635
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,360
The stuff he does.

636
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,220
And his video production.

637
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,060
It's so high effort for like 150k subscribers.

638
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,280
You guys should check him out.

639
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,980
He's actually...

640
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,360
I feel like he's very underrated.

641
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,420
Also, here's one of my favorite videos.

642
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,940
I talked about it before, but I wanted to show you guys.

643
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,560
Because I couldn't show it on YouTube.

644
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,700
It was me, Barry.

645
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,800
I made them draw Lola Bunny with fewer sexual features so that you wouldn't be horny.

646
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,140
And reduce your blood flow to make you a millisecond slower.

647
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,200
Is it slow enough for me to...

648
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,920
Kill Iris?

649
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,240
Remember when you were making out with your first girlfriend?

650
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,260
It was me, Barry.

651
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,360
And you came right as she touched your leg?

652
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,900
It was me, Barry.

653
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:19,160
I jerked you off at super speed so it would seem like you nutted at just a woman's touch.

654
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,200
Sorry, I had to...

655
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,680
It was me, Barry.

656
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,000
It was...

657
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,260
It was honestly...

658
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,240
One of my favorite...

659
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,160
Uh...

660
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,180
Reverse flash...

661
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,620
Reverse flash lines.

662
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,960
It's a classic!

663
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,220
It's such a classic!

664
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,500
Oh my god!

665
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,420
So my favorite like DC animator slash...

666
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,840
Okay, she does like Team Fortress 2 animations too.

667
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,100
Spineapples.

668
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,580
I don't know if you guys know Spineapples.

669
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,520
But like I fucking love her animations.

670
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,180
And like her like Team Fortress 2.

671
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,520
And like...

672
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,840
Her Team Fortress 2.

673
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,560
And DC animations are so good.

674
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,440
Like this one.

675
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,920
I love Spineapples.

676
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,220
What is this?

677
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,220
It's a meme, Batman.

678
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,240
I don't understand.

679
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,040
What do you not understand?

680
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,860
I don't get the joke.

681
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,400
Well, you see, people usually only play on one console.

682
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,980
But both these women are so attractive that you'd want to play with them both.

683
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,980
But they aren't consoles.

684
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,580
It's a classic!

685
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,740
The shirts they're wearing have the console logos on them.

686
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,940
Are you some kind of furry?

687
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,680
You're the one here wearing an animal suit.

688
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,060
It's true.

689
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,780
It's true.

690
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,800
I think Batman's a furry.

691
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,360
Because why else would he dress up as a bat?

692
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,480
Checkmate.

693
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,960
But you guys should check out Spineapples.

694
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,860
He's like...

695
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,180
They're one of my favorite...

696
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,060
They're one of my favorite like animators.

697
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,100
They're like so OG.

698
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,260
Holy shit.

699
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,160
Some of their animations are like...

700
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,940
What is it?

701
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,600
Like four plus years ago.

702
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,700
Oh my god.

703
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,860
This rap.

704
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,620
The rap battle.

705
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,420
The spy rap.

706
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,200
Do you guys know the spy rap?

707
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,420
The one with Spy vs.

708
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,020
Tracer?

709
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:22,460
What's that?

710
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,500
Trust to the night.

711
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,360
No clue.

712
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,240
Is that a disguise?

713
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,280
With a classy suit and tie.

714
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,760
Who will look good at your funeral?

715
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,160
Bye!

716
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,160
It's time to murder this track.

717
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,060
You'll find a knife in its back.

718
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,880
Got equipment?

719
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,000
Watch me break it.

720
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,740
Saw me die?

721
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,000
I promptly faked it.

722
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,840
I'm a man of many faces.

723
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,660
Infiltrated plenty bases.

724
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,800
Stole your intel.

725
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,620
What a rush.

726
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,560
Even though there is much.

727
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:43,860
Oh, it's Sombra?

728
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,720
Oh, wait.

729
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,060
What was it?

730
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,900
Scout vs.

731
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,040
Tracer was the...

732
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,920
The OG rap.

733
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,380
I'm just pride on all your clothes.

734
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,280
And guess who won?

735
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,780
He's better.

736
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,520
Oh my god.

737
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,020
Okay, guys.

738
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,560
Guys.

739
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:54,820
Guys.

740
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,240
OG.

741
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,140
OG raps.

742
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,640
Scout.

743
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,000
It's not cringe.

744
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,160
It was not cringe.

745
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,080
It's actually so good.

746
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,140
It's so good.

747
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,440
Back when, like, everyone fucking did rap battles.

748
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,400
Every...

749
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,800
Like, you know how, like, rap battles...

750
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,900
Like, rap battles of history, like, pioneered?

751
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,740
Okay, they didn't pioneer rap battles.

752
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,620
Like, it was there for a while.

753
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,180
But...

754
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,800
It's not cringe.

755
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,960
They were so good.

756
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,060
But, like, it made rap battles, like, with, like...

757
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,880
What's the word?

758
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,760
With, like, pop culture really popular.

759
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,940
So, then, people did, like, parodies.

760
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,340
With, uh...

761
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,220
They did parodies...

762
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,600
Oh my god.

763
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,260
It's still going?

764
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,220
They're so old now.

765
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,960
But they did, like, parodies with, like, games and, like, anime and stuff like that.

766
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,020
Fucking...

767
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,140
Bro, I love the Scout versus Tracer.

768
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,960
Scout versus Tracer was really good.

769
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,860
From JT.

770
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,980
Oh my god, Machinima.

771
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,620
I actually have the song in my fucking playlist!

772
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,460
I love it.

773
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:00,920
I love it.

774
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,320
It happens everywhere.

775
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,000
Bop, bop, bop.

776
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,960
It's not cringe!

777
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,240
This was 6 years ago!

778
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,220
It was like it's history.

779
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,940
We were part of history!

780
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,880
You don't...

781
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,540
Okay, oh, yeah.

782
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,420
We don't miss Machinima.

783
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:14,680
...

784
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,700
Ha!

785
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,900
Even though he is talkin' to!

786
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,600
Hello, George군y!

787
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,440
It's about time I battle you.

788
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,200
Ladies first.

789
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,880
Got an aptitude.

790
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,680
Check the time.

791
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:33,520
You're out of가� LambOま ng fucking time!

792
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,140
Brody actually slaps.

793
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,620
It's just the animation is old.

794
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,180
It was six years ago.

795
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,780
It's not cringe.

796
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:48,680
Stop.

797
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,830
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

798
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,370
Somebody said that they nerfed Tracer's ass, but like...

799
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,190
It never... It didn't really change that much to be fair, I feel like.

800
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:08,770
Okay, wait.

801
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,570
Sombra's spy was good too.

802
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,070
Guys, I swear!

803
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,650
You guys just don't understand!

804
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,910
Today's rap battle is brought to you by Roblox.

805
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,930
King weapon, free jerk.

806
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,210
It's nine!

807
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,370
Who's that dressed to the nines?

808
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,070
No clue.

809
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,010
They're so good!

810
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:33,510
They're rapping!

811
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,550
It's not a face.

812
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,730
It's not even super!

813
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,530
This was literally six years ago!

814
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,890
Wait, there's Mercy versus Medic?

815
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,470
I've never seen the Mercy versus Medic one.

816
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,370
What's the Mercy versus Medic?

817
00:43:59,210 --> 00:43:59,970
They did so many.

818
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,090
God damn.

819
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,290
The animation is so dated.

820
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,750
Where's Medic?

821
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,910
I don't care about Mercy.

822
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:30,970
Whoa!

823
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,250
Okay, not gonna lie.

824
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,450
The voice acting for this is pretty good.

825
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,170
It looks like a nerve.

826
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,430
Yes, I think it's work.

827
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,410
Feeling is not as rewarding as a hurting.

828
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,730
Okay, this was pretty bad.

829
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:43,210
I'll admit.

830
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,170
This one was pretty bad.

831
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,830
Okay.

832
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,510
I'll give you guys that, that one was pretty bad.

833
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,190
Okay, but did you guys know like...

834
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,950
The TF2 like cast... cast actually did like a song cover together?

835
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,970
I saved it because I was like...

836
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,670
Whoa, what?

837
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,410
That's the Team Fortress 2 voice actors.

838
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,910
Okay, where is it?

839
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,030
I saved the video too.

840
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,610
It's called the Sandwich Blues.

841
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,910
They actually did like...

842
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,350
Yeah, they did.

843
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,290
This was like a month ago.

844
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:17,790
Last month.

845
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,990
Woke up this morning.

846
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,690
The package was gone.

847
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:22,430
Didn't leave no note.

848
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,230
Nothing to go on.

849
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,190
Looked under the covers.

850
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,090
Under the sheet.

851
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,430
Now Heavy's broken hearted.

852
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,030
He's got nothing to eat.

853
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,650
We got the Sandwich Blues.

854
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,970
Way down in our souls.

855
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,650
Yeah, they're doing like song covers now, which I thought was funny.

856
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,070
Way down in our souls.

857
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,990
This can't be happening.

858
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,250
Oh God, they're so old.

859
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,490
Yeah, I think they're like in their 50s or 60s now.

860
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,890
Or they have to be in 60s.

861
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,090
Gonna have a plan.

862
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,110
Where we gonna look.

863
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,530
In so many places.

864
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,010
We could write a book.

865
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,430
I've been to California.

866
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,630
Boys actors are so talented.

867
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:05,490
I've been to Peru.

868
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,370
I can only do like creepy voices.

869
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,610
What are we going to do?

870
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,950
We got the Sandwich Blues.

871
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,190
Way down in our souls.

872
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,050
We got the Sandwich Blues.

873
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,910
Things are taking a toll.

874
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,690
This can't be happening.

875
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,850
Heavy is out of control.

876
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,770
Please stop it, Heavy.

877
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,150
We got a mysterious woman.

878
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,170
She's even got a past.

879
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,170
Oh yeah, this boy.

880
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,630
The...

881
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,690
What was it?

882
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,510
What's her name?

883
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,070
The announcer?

884
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,770
The announcer and Sniper are like married.

885
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:42,310
Ira.

886
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,370
She's met us in a bar.

887
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,570
But we ain't got no sandwich.

888
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,370
We only got a call.

889
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,010
We got the Sandwich Blues.

890
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,990
Way down in our souls.

891
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,710
We got the Sandwich Blues.

892
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,670
Don't need to take a poll.

893
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:07,230
If we don't find it soon, Heavy going to eat a throne.

894
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,370
Yeah, they're doing like...

895
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,290
They're doing like music covers now together, which I thought was really cute.

896
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,350
Spies cogitated.

897
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,210
Maybe it's a curse.

898
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,050
Edmund's intimidating.

899
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,030
She's nobody's nurse.

900
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,990
If we don't find the sandwich, Heavy's gonna need a hearse.

901
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,570
We got the Sandwich Blues.

902
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,650
We got the Sandwich Blues.

903
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,630
Way down in our souls.

904
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,550
It's still the Sandwich Blues.

905
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,390
Put it on a scroll.

906
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,530
All right, guys.

907
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,170
Now we're going to see something really cursed.

908
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,690
I need to show you guys this video.

909
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,330
Look at this hippie crap.

910
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,590
I'm sure no one will be creeped out by this.

911
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:52,770
No.

912
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:55,630
This popped up.

913
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,590
I like...

914
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,130
Look, it's this boss.

915
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,630
It's the boss.

916
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,530
It's the boss and dog.

917
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:01,910
Look into it.

918
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:02,330
Look.

919
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,270
For those who don't know, they're going to create something very special.

920
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,430
So I bought a robotic dog.

921
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,030
This video is brought to you by Squarespace.

922
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,690
No, not this video.

923
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,150
So what...

924
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,850
So they're going to make something beautiful today with Furby.

925
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,350
So how are we actually going to turn our robot into a Furby?

926
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,150
Well, we know someone who has a lot of experience 3D printing Furby projects.

927
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,670
I never...

928
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,290
Like these masks.

929
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,530
I want that mask.

930
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:37,890
Holy shit.

931
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:38,570
That's terrifying.

932
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,450
That's fucking terrifying.

933
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,930
By the way, I've never watched a full video.

934
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,930
Only watched like the final product.

935
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,750
So I actually don't know what it is.

936
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,630
I don't know how they made this.

937
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:53,470
Our first step was to 3D scan the robot and send it to him so he could accurately model the Furby parts for it.

938
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,910
I'm collecting so many points of data.

939
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,130
I'm going to angle down and kind of get some of the notes.

940
00:48:59,130 --> 00:48:59,850
Show me your nooks and crannies.

941
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,370
Show me your crannies!

942
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,230
Evan zooming in on his butt.

943
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:05,650
Well, good posing.

944
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,270
So we just got an update from Austin.

945
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,130
He has a few different mock-ups of different forms the Furby could take.

946
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:13,190
Wait, different forms?

947
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,090
There's more than one?

948
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:22,590
When we were originally talking about this idea, Evan was showing like, see if we can try to put the Furby's face like directly over the front of it.

949
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,110
Oh god, that's more terrifying than what it was.

950
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,530
Not in what it came to be.

951
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,450
The best ones that I could think of and included like some of the pros and cons that I think we've got.

952
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,110
Yes, I'm ready.

953
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,430
So the first option.

954
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:40,570
Oh no.

955
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,590
I'm just gonna say this up front.

956
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,370
It's possible that these mock-ups might be too good.

957
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,430
I know, that's really good.

958
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:51,930
Such glorious heights.

959
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,410
Here we go, we'll start with the pros.

960
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,330
He's huggable.

961
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,310
He's huggable.

962
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,490
I thought about like baby doll arms sort of thing.

963
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,950
I've got mixed feelings.

964
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,950
Yeah.

965
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,210
There's plenty of room for the electronics cons.

966
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,070
It might just look like it's a Furby sitting on a dog's head.

967
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,610
Attachment points is another thing that we might need to figure out.

968
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,490
Yeah, we want to make sure it's not top heavy and toppling.

969
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,950
Wait, what's the spider?

970
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,630
Oh no!

971
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,490
Oh no!

972
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,790
I'm so uncomfortable!

973
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,090
I'm so uncomfortable!

974
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,710
No Furby on your back!

975
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:29,870
No Furby!

976
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:33,030
Once again, it could look like a Furby riding back to the dog.

977
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:36,550
We could have people commenting how it doesn't actually have six legs.

978
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,170
Well, spiders have eight legs, so we'd have a lot of legs to have.

979
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,370
So this is the last one.

980
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,050
I call this one Mr. No Neck.

981
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:45,910
What is that?

982
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,150
Oh god!

983
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,630
It looks like a primate Furby.

984
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,010
It uses less material.

985
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,430
Yeah, very human-like.

986
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,830
It's so cool!

987
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,170
That looks so cool though!

988
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,010
Look!

989
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:58,930
Think of the Twitch Prime!

990
00:50:59,150 --> 00:50:59,370
Thank you!

991
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:07,030
But the original thing that brought up this whole issue was the front sensors.

992
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:07,790
Yeah.

993
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,510
It might be okay, but we could just avoid the whole worry by going with the centaur, you know?

994
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:19,030
Even though Mr. No Neck looks amazing and that was actually one of my original visions, I'm most curious about the centaur.

995
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:19,510
What about you?

996
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,870
I am also, I think, leaning towards centaur.

997
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,010
I feel like it gives us a little bit more wiggle room in terms of electronics.

998
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:29,390
And honestly, I thought it would be much more cursed feeling to me, but he almost feels like a llama.

999
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:30,610
Oh yeah!

1000
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,870
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

1001
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,510
He looks so huggable!

1002
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:42,050
To be fair, if you compare this with the other two that we saw, like this looks so cute now.

1003
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:48,630
This looks actually cute compared to the other ones that we saw.

1004
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,510
It actually makes it look good.

1005
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:58,290
I mean, compared to the fucking spider and the No Neck?

1006
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,110
Come on!

1007
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,830
The belly doesn't have any moving parts though.

1008
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:05,830
So we thought we'd add a pop of color with pink inspired by the original grey and pink furby we bought.

1009
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:06,870
I had a furby.

1010
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,870
I had the furby and those little dog ones.

1011
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,570
Little dog pets.

1012
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,150
And then the...

1013
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,290
How is it?

1014
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,450
The cat ones as well.

1015
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,750
No Neck was not cute.

1016
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,450
No- I don't know what you guys are thinking.

1017
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,510
No Neck was not cute.

1018
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,650
It looks like a fucking monkey with a furby attached to his head.

1019
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,870
We can just shave it, right?

1020
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,270
It doesn't make it better.

1021
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,430
Oh, for real friends!

1022
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:32,790
Yes!

1023
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,190
That's a pretty good match.

1024
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,890
Yeah, it's a good match for the grey.

1025
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,490
You combine that with the pink, I feel like it's very furby-esque.

1026
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:41,970
That's very furby-esque.

1027
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,070
We did it, baby.

1028
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,330
He's gonna be so hairy.

1029
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,050
He's gonna be so hairy.

1030
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:53,250
I like how they're giving us a tutorial on making our very own furby.

1031
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,750
It's so furbycore, yeah.

1032
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,930
You cover that with tape.

1033
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,090
And then you sharpie over the tape, cut out your pattern, and then make that in fabric.

1034
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,430
Yeah, let's see how this works.

1035
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,870
Any like- I need you guys to know, these cost like, what is it?

1036
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,130
They cost like more than 30 grand, right?

1037
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,330
The Boston Robots on its own?

1038
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:13,790
Yeah.

1039
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:24,050
Any like super rich dragoons wanna make a dragoon version of- We'll only have to do a dragoon version.

1040
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,430
Oh, like 10k.

1041
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,430
Oh, it's less now.

1042
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:30,190
It used to be like crazy expensive when they first launched.

1043
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,510
Oh, it's 1,600 now?

1044
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,930
Wait, that's a steal!

1045
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,550
Any like engineer dragoons?

1046
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,110
Any engineer dragoons that can make this?

1047
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,950
Oh yeah, cause it's like mass produced now.

1048
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,630
When it first came out, it was like crazy fucking expensive.

1049
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,650
The lady didn't cut it, she ripped it.

1050
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:52,470
Which maybe is best practice for this type of fabric, but she had to use so much effort.

1051
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,870
She was like, hold on, I need to chug this real quick.

1052
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,750
I could buy one, but I'm not an engineer.

1053
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,050
I can't make my own dragoon version of this.

1054
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,930
And then she moved on to the other one, and I was like, can I help?

1055
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,810
Like, I don't know what to- I didn't know what to do to like be helpful, but she was just destroying the thing.

1056
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,430
Oh, this is now from Boston Dynamics?

1057
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:10,630
It's a bootleg?

1058
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,470
Can I copy your homework?

1059
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,050
Let me change it up a little bit.

1060
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,350
Okay, let's take a little dress, a little tiktok.

1061
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,030
Oh yeah.

1062
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,350
Oh, this cut's fine.

1063
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,070
I don't know why she didn't cut it.

1064
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,770
They just need some heavy frickin' duty scissors.

1065
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,370
They have heavy frickin' duty scissors.

1066
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,930
It's Joanne's.

1067
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,590
I don't know what was going on.

1068
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,890
Either way, I was rooting for her the whole time.

1069
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,430
Can I see that cross section?

1070
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,850
So I'm gonna skip the fur part.

1071
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,110
Oh my god.

1072
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:48,610
What?

1073
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,230
Look at it!

1074
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,710
That's kind of glorious.

1075
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,390
Do you want to do the rest of the leg and see what it looks like?

1076
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,970
Oh, they're like plastic wrapping it so the fur doesn't come off.

1077
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,570
Oh, they're getting like the pattern.

1078
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,610
I see.

1079
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,250
There you go, there you go.

1080
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:07,910
Can you imagine it?

1081
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,090
We're skipping the fur part of the Furby.

1082
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,750
Oh my god.

1083
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,310
We did such a good job!

1084
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,010
It actually looks so good.

1085
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:16,990
Oh my god.

1086
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,910
You guys can see the Boston 9-9ers when they're crazy expensive.

1087
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,710
I'm like having a little bit showing at the elbow and stuff.

1088
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,650
It doesn't bother me at all.

1089
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,690
Like, here it is.

1090
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,030
You zoom out, you don't even notice that.

1091
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:26,550
Yeah.

1092
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,550
Hey, thank you for the Thank you for the tear once up.

1093
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,330
Thank you, thank you.

1094
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,390
See, it doesn't look that fucked up.

1095
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,230
He's getting a Furby.

1096
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:43,710
When we started this project, I really had no clue how we were gonna make it happen.

1097
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,570
It doesn't look that bad, guys!

1098
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,370
I'll tell you guys, the end result looks so cute.

1099
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,790
We're doing it.

1100
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:55,110
We don't have any new dance patterns or anything like that, but we are winging it, and it's working.

1101
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:56,310
Okay.

1102
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,450
Can you walk without the fur getting caught in the joints?

1103
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,030
I was not smart enough to do this.

1104
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,050
Maybe we check, maybe we check after the walk.

1105
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:06,610
Imagine my stream is just making like Furby abominations.

1106
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,550
Oh my god, look at him dance!

1107
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:10,630
Oh yeah, he's moving.

1108
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:11,670
Oh, he's tap dancing.

1109
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:12,570
Oh, he's moving and grooving.

1110
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,650
That's so cute!

1111
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:17,130
This is my new pet.

1112
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,510
This is my new pet.

1113
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,290
Yeah!

1114
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:20,530
Yeah!

1115
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,010
Hey, little guy.

1116
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:31,950
I remember when the Boston Dynamics released the first video, the dog, and all they did was just push it around and hit it.

1117
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,070
People were like, No!

1118
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,950
Can we know a little bit of what we're doing?

1119
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,850
But we haven't seen what it looks like.

1120
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:40,390
Stop!

1121
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,590
Is that a note?

1122
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,730
Oh my god!

1123
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,910
Awesome!

1124
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:49,310
The exhilarating Furbot instruction manual!

1125
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,770
Oh my gosh!

1126
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:52,670
Look at this!

1127
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,390
This is so fantastic!

1128
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,390
First thing I see is this adorable thing.

1129
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,150
Yeah, you guys are gonna see an even more adorable thing later.

1130
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:00,510
I feel like it's Christmas.

1131
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:00,610
I know.

1132
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,210
Look at the gaming person!

1133
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:06,670
That's a square face!

1134
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,390
No!

1135
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,610
I don't get paid!

1136
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,150
Can I kiss?

1137
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:16,130
Square face doesn't sponsor this!

1138
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,310
Guys, no!

1139
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,430
Don't type that URL!

1140
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,050
Instead, type the gamer subs way!

1141
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,410
Don't type this URL!

1142
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:22,990
Step 1.

1143
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,210
Insert both support arms into the main support base and tighten both...

1144
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,170
We don't get paid!

1145
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,210
Step 2.

1146
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:32,510
Slide battery power bank into dedicated slot on backup quadruped.

1147
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:33,270
Step 3.

1148
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:37,070
Wrap, buckle, and tighten down both support straps around the quadruped robot.

1149
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,590
Guys, I'll pay somebody to follow these instructions.

1150
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,830
Okay, play Furby body on main screen.

1151
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,370
And make a dragoon version of this.

1152
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:45,810
And make a dragoon version of this.

1153
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,670
I will pay you.

1154
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,170
I will pay a dragoon to make a dragoon version of this.

1155
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,270
I will pay a dragoon to make a dragoon version of this.

1156
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,090
Yeah, it's just like the bones.

1157
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,670
I can see the mouth through there.

1158
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:56,870
Where's your Squarespace sponsorship?

1159
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,390
I don't know Squarespace!

1160
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,490
Where is my Squarespace sponsorship?

1161
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:02,450
That's asleep right now.

1162
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:03,850
Oh, this is...

1163
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,850
Oh my god!

1164
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,210
And then have it run around conventions.

1165
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:10,550
And then have it run around conventions.

1166
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,390
And just terrorize people.

1167
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,480
Oh god!

1168
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,780
I don't like...

1169
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,980
I think he looks worse with the eyes closed.

1170
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,160
Oh, I hate that.

1171
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,380
I don't like that.

1172
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,840
I think it's like really bad because he doesn't even have fur.

1173
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,300
It's like a skinned Furby.

1174
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,700
God save us all!

1175
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,940
That's awful!

1176
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,100
Maverick, thank you for the toy fun!

1177
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:42,940
Get that sus!

1178
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,420
Thank you!

1179
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,600
He's like awakening as he's being operated on.

1180
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,680
Like his anesthesia is lifting.

1181
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,320
Oh my god!

1182
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,640
Let's open the box.

1183
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,060
Let's open this last box.

1184
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,260
I hate this abomination.

1185
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,280
That's so sweet.

1186
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,800
Oh my god!

1187
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,720
Is that...

1188
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,380
Is that...

1189
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,840
Oh, it's so cute!

1190
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,260
They made pens dispenser as a gift.

1191
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,220
Hehehe.

1192
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,140
Hehehe.

1193
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,620
Stop looking at me.

1194
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,420
Mmm.

1195
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,140
Mmm.

1196
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,300
Just like chalk.

1197
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,940
Okay.

1198
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,040
Back to it.

1199
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,820
Let's make it say something.

1200
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,660
Ready?

1201
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,360
Yeah.

1202
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:36,960
D 'oh.

1203
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,300
Oh.

1204
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,120
Subscribe, subscribe to Evan.

1205
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,380
Okay, look.

1206
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,720
For all the...

1207
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm saying... all I'm saying Dragoons.

1208
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,120
I'll pay someone to make a Dragoon equivalent version of this.

1209
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:59,640
And then I want it to run around different conventions and be like, subscribe to Doki Berry.

1210
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,660
Reven time.

1211
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,920
Reven time.

1212
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,480
Er, er, er.

1213
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,060
I will pay a smart engineering dragoon to do this.

1214
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,480
I will do it.

1215
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:29,400
I think the investment goes a long way.

1216
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,020
Curse mode?

1217
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,460
What's curse mode?

1218
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,460
I'm so tempted to press it.

1219
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,080
I know, me too.

1220
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,480
I want to press it, but I feel like we need to finish him first.

1221
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,440
And then see what can be more cursed than he already is.

1222
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:54,800
Oh!

1223
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:55,940
Oh!

1224
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,880
The Dark Souls!

1225
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,820
The curse of Furby!

1226
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,020
Oh my god!

1227
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,100
Oh my god!

1228
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,920
Oh my god!

1229
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,520
Yes!

1230
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,440
This is everything that I hoped for!

1231
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,600
Icy, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

1232
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,020
Thank you!

1233
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,680
The Power Stats.

1234
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,160
Wait, is that even curse mode?

1235
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,420
Is it curse mode yet?

1236
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,260
I'm ready.

1237
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,900
Oh yeah, they're going to put fur on it now?

1238
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:28,740
Help!

1239
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,300
Oh my god.

1240
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,080
They're like mummifying you.

1241
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,220
They're doing it.

1242
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,120
It's almost like they're mummifying the Furby.

1243
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,530
I 3D printed some ears.

1244
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,150
Can you see me?

1245
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,230
I can see you.

1246
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,110
It's evolving in real time.

1247
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,010
It's getting so dusty.

1248
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,270
I'm literally immune.

1249
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,810
I seriously think I'm more used to cat hair being on me.

1250
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:08,930
Like, this is normal.

1251
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:09,750
I don't know.

1252
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,540
It's like more fur than robotics if you think about it.

1253
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,160
Oh god, his neck is so long.

1254
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,540
Guys, don't look yet.

1255
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:37,060
There's another child I really like to watch that does like repurposing Halloween decorations.

1256
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,520
Hi Hope y'all got a lot of fun.

1257
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,460
Yeah Oh my god, look at him all strut.

1258
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,680
Oh my God, shaking is a backboard.

1259
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,640
Not to pat ourselves on the back, but like we did a really good job.

1260
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,420
Oh, my God.

1261
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,160
He's outside.

1262
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:02,240
I can see totally.

1263
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,140
He is very cursed.

1264
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,820
But he can still move around.

1265
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,640
But he's got that Furby vibe.

1266
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,560
There you go!

1267
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,980
Bro, he's better than a real dog!

1268
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,380
Because he can actually talk!

1269
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:26,000
He'll be like, Doki, what happened to Doki Amber Doge?

1270
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,660
And then... Oh!

1271
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,320
He's got eggs!

1272
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,020
They're eggs!

1273
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,980
Let our new friends introduce themselves.

1274
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,640
Hello, Evan.

1275
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,360
Coco.

1276
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:47,520
Thank you for helping my past owner bring me to life.

1277
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:58,410
With damage so much more than mine, I am no longer well for

1278
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,060
now.

1279
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,800
Coco seems like a nice guy.

1280
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,560
So I think he's ready to be introduced to the world.

1281
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,160
What do you think?

1282
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:19,840
He seems safe.

1283
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,480
Yeah!

1284
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,660
Safe!

1285
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,920
Coco seems like a nice guy!

1286
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:25,940
Oh my god!

1287
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,240
Seeing him move like that is so scary!

1288
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,980
Oh my god, he's like shaking his hips!

1289
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,900
Oh, we have the evil mode!

1290
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,400
We never got to see evil mode!

1291
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,680
I never got to see evil mode!

1292
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:35,800
Oh, the button!

1293
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,960
Evan's pushing the button!

1294
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,620
What's evil mode?

1295
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,300
What does it look like?

1296
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,380
Oh, I don't like... Oh...

1297
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,300
Oh, I don't like evil... Oh!

1298
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,760
I don't... I don't like evil mode.

1299
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,560
Imagine just having this running around during Halloween.

1300
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,760
Oh no.

1301
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,540
It like looks towards me.

1302
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:20,920
Killer feet!

1303
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,320
Thank you for the tier one sub!

1304
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:22,660
Thank you!

1305
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,480
No!

1306
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,630
Shall we take him out?

1307
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,730
Let's take him out!

1308
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,690
I'm sure no one will be creeped out by this.

1309
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,270
Alright, so I watched the ending.

1310
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,770
I skipped all the... I skipped like how to make it.

1311
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,670
But I watched the ending of this.

1312
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,870
Yeah, like just taking it out for a walk.

1313
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,290
I didn't even know about the curse mode.

1314
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,510
I love how they gave Coco a dog tag and a collar.

1315
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,470
And it's named Coco!

1316
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:03,970
The dog tag is named Coco!

1317
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:06,490
Oh no!

1318
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,370
Oh god, it's so...

1319
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:11,650
The poor dog!

1320
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,270
The poor dog!

1321
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,250
And then look at my eyes.

1322
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,010
That is so rad.

1323
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,070
That is so rad!

1324
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,250
That was awesome!

1325
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,410
That was so cool!

1326
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:35,790
He's like...

1327
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,110
He's a propaganda dog.

1328
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:41,450
Yeah.

1329
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:42,890
So rad.

1330
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:43,930
He likes it.

1331
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:44,610
I think so.

1332
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,590
He likes it.

1333
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,230
It's like a real dog.

1334
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,290
This guy has infected with internet.

1335
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:56,310
Be used later for protection and security when they put a gun attached to it.

1336
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,690
The new protection.

1337
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:01,930
Oh my god, look!

1338
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,330
He's picking up the bus!

1339
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:04,770
It's like a real dog!

1340
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,150
Coco!

1341
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:23,270
Is it a beautiful family?

1342
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,490
Thanks again to Austin.

1343
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,990
Don't forget to check out post video.

1344
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:27,790
Oh Beautiful!

1345
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,950
I'll...

1346
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,950
All I'm saying guys.

1347
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:39,530
All I'm saying is I'll 100 percent invest in this.

1348
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,750
If any very smart engineer goons out there make a Dragoon equivalent of this.

1349
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:52,330
This is the TikTok video I saw.

1350
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,570
I feel like this was worse.

1351
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,850
This is a lot worse.

1352
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:05,790
Oh, look at this!

1353
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,030
It taught your cat to play piano!

1354
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:11,650
Look at this!

1355
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,540
Oh my god.

1356
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:32,280
I bet you the Furby dog can learn piano faster than this cat.

1357
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,660
It's so cute!

1358
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:36,940
Look!

1359
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,920
He's learning!

1360
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,400
His brain is expanding!

1361
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,180
He's playing on his own!

1362
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,140
That's so cute!

1363
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,180
Anyway, I felt like you guys needed that to...

1364
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,860
We needed the cleanser for that.

1365
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,160
Also, I was watching people make school lunches.

1366
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,320
Okay, I was watching somebody watch the school lunch shit.

1367
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,320
But I've also watched actual parents making school lunches.

1368
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,200
And I'm just like, holy shit!

1369
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,340
The amount of effort and time.

1370
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,020
Look at this!

1371
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,580
We're gonna watch somebody reacting to this.

1372
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,400
I'll get the actual channel.

1373
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,520
So we don't react to the person reacting.

1374
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,560
But I was like, looking at her making school lunches.

1375
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:34,380
And I'm like, Jesus!

1376
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,500
Oh my god!

1377
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,680
She does so much too!

1378
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:38,900
Reacception!

1379
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,420
Like, look at this!

1380
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:41,760
Oh my god.

1381
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,000
Whoops.

1382
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,080
I forgot to put it in a playlist.

1383
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,800
Like, she has like...

1384
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,120
There's like different stuff like bath times.

1385
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:54,500
And like, she does like DIYs for like her dogs.

1386
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:54,840
And water.

1387
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,140
And stuff like that.

1388
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,380
And I'm like, oh my god!

1389
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,080
That's like so much effort.

1390
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,900
My mom just buys stuff.

1391
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,700
Okay, wait.

1392
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,400
Let me show you guys.

1393
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,220
Alright.

1394
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,180
Where's my playlist?

1395
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,000
Where's my liked videos?

1396
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:12,840
There it is.

1397
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,820
Alright, here.

1398
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,160
I was like...

1399
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,220
The commitment to this.

1400
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:18,120
Ugh.

1401
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,980
She has a whole drawer for like her kids.

1402
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:22,960
Like...

1403
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,080
This is just dedicated to making food for her children.

1404
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,720
What a mom!

1405
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:38,630
Like, she has like...

1406
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:39,550
Like, there's like...

1407
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,690
There's a lot of these channels of like moms making school lunches.

1408
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,810
Or like just like lunch and dinner for their children.

1409
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:47,010
And like...

1410
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:51,230
One of the moms like showed their fucking collection of cookie cutters.

1411
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,510
It was actually crazy.

1412
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:53,890
They had like...

1413
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:54,710
They had like...

1414
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,530
Oh, I think like a hundred cookie cutters for different themes.

1415
01:10:59,050 --> 01:10:59,650
Like...

1416
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,430
The budget for this?

1417
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:02,550
Not gonna lie.

1418
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,190
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say.

1419
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,330
Uh...

1420
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:08,990
This is...

1421
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,150
This is so fucked up for me to say.

1422
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,270
But like...

1423
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,430
I feel like...

1424
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:14,850
She could buy...

1425
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:17,670
Healthier foods...

1426
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,870
For their child.

1427
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:20,290
Um...

1428
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:21,730
Like that's tastier.

1429
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,110
For like...

1430
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,490
One third of the price...

1431
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,770
Of all this stuff.

1432
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:29,410
She has.

1433
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:29,630
She has.

1434
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:34,390
Yes!

1435
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,650
Like...

1436
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,790
It's like...

1437
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:37,130
Look...

1438
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,890
Cause you need two cookie cutters?

1439
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:39,990
And then...

1440
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,690
Look at all this...

1441
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:41,090
Oh my god.

1442
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,010
That's a lot of seasoning.

1443
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,830
Oh my god.

1444
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,510
Like she has like a snack drawer too.

1445
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,410
And then like a container for Cheez-Its?

1446
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,580
Anyway, she does like...

1447
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,380
But it's crazy.

1448
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,680
She's like so dedicated to her child.

1449
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,220
Because...

1450
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,440
Because she made like...

1451
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:13,740
Uh...

1452
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:14,760
Her own bakery.

1453
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,080
For her child.

1454
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,120
I'm like...

1455
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,960
Oh my god.

1456
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,400
She's so creative.

1457
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,700
That shit is so bougie.

1458
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,080
She doesn't know how to sew.

1459
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,400
But look at what she made.

1460
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,680
Look at all that.

1461
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:52,880
This is amazing.

1462
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,420
Oh, she does that.

1463
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:53,720
Listen up!

1464
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:54,000
I was so excited.

1465
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,120
Can you close that?

1466
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,680
OK, she's collecting this little big plate?

1467
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,300
I am a mess.

1468
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,840
Oh my god.

1469
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,740
What was that?

1470
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,080
what was that?

1471
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:03,760
That little Tori Grimes.

1472
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:03,820
Le그�y.

1473
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,540
If you know what Leeroy's talking about...

1474
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:06,560
Have you heard of this story?

1475
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,420
Oh my god!

1476
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,100
I want to be this fucking parent's child!

1477
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,400
Look at this!

1478
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,820
This screams of mommy issues!

1479
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,120
It's not fair!

1480
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,980
And then there's...

1481
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,560
For my daughter's lunch today, we are doing a deconstructed...

1482
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,140
What the fuck!

1483
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:43,640
Look at all these cookie cutters!

1484
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,500
That's what I'm saying!

1485
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,780
I actually subscribed to this other mom channel that makes lunches for their kids.

1486
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,520
And it's more than this.

1487
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,560
She has so many cookie cutters.

1488
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,620
It's actually crazy.

1489
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,760
This lunch box is perfect for this meal because it contains a thermos compartment that will keep the noodles warm.

1490
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,120
First up are turkey dogs, broccoli, and a pizza.

1491
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,500
And the cutest ball of soy sauce.

1492
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:09,260
This child is definitely an only child!

1493
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,380
Oh no, for real.

1494
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,840
No, she is definitely...

1495
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,120
And of course, our spoon and fork.

1496
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,500
I know some of y'all love to drag my lunch box ideas...

1497
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,480
There's a mini... do you see that mini Heinz?

1498
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,500
Is that mini Heinz?

1499
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,580
What is that?

1500
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,120
Like a soy...

1501
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,380
It's so tiny!

1502
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,360
They come in that size?

1503
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,540
...to drag my lunch box ideas.

1504
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:35,120
So for clarification, this is a loose interpretation of a ramen bowl.

1505
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,280
Not to be taken literally.

1506
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,300
My four-year-old is my harshest critic, so if she loves it, that's all.

1507
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,420
Oh my god, she...

1508
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,560
No, no, you are not using her Amazon link.

1509
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:50,420
Anyway, so there's like... these are the things I watch, by the way.

1510
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,880
I don't like critique it as harsh as this.

1511
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,060
It's just like, I'm just watching it and I was like, oh my god.

1512
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:04,420
Here I am ordering Uber Eats while she makes a fucking like Mona Lisa lunch for her child.

1513
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,720
No pre-advertising.

1514
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,220
Alright, where's this other one I want to show you guys?

1515
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,880
Oh, look at this!

1516
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,140
Okay, okay, look at it.

1517
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,040
Where is it?

1518
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,580
There was like... did you guys know?

1519
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:25,240
Okay, at one point, my algorithm was filled with like Lego builders.

1520
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,360
And like, there was like this... apparently there's like custom Lego blocks.

1521
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:30,780
Where is it?

1522
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,700
I was... I got recommended some like custom Legos.

1523
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,240
And I was like, what the fuck?

1524
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,300
Oh wait, here you go.

1525
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:41,560
In this box is $211 worth of custom cursed Lego parts which are the weirdest in the world.

1526
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,560
Let's find out what's inside.

1527
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,980
The first item is a custom Walter White from Breaking Bad.

1528
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,280
Walter comes with, of course, some nice blue candy.

1529
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,160
I looked at the website and like...

1530
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:58,360
In this bag, we have an Amazon Prime box and a custom military helmet.

1531
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,280
I also got this very strange long head.

1532
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,680
I love the long head ones.

1533
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,020
I actually sort of like the long heads.

1534
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,460
I don't know what these guys are, but they look funny enough.

1535
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,920
Um, here we have this guy with an extremely tiny face.

1536
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,120
Look at his tiny face!

1537
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,940
I also got this weird double-faced head.

1538
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And also this drunken long clown face.

1539
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,220
I also bought this calculator with a hidden message when you flip it upside down.

1540
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,140
Too bad I can't read.

1541
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,260
Here's this cracked phone.

1542
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,180
A US passport.

1543
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:19,980
A bounce trap.

1544
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,000
I also got this oddly chilled sock monkey.

1545
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,880
A snack people were eating for some reason.

1546
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:24,900
Here's a magic eight ball.

1547
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,420
Here we have an innocent videotape.

1548
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,620
Lastly, a pouch of blood.

1549
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,260
It's so cool.

1550
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,180
Wait, what the fuck?

1551
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,200
What is that?

1552
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,480
What is this video that I liked?

1553
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,800
Was this an accident?

1554
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,420
I'm scared.

1555
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,040
I don't actually remember this video that I liked.

1556
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,480
But also did you guys know these like channels?

1557
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,540
Wait, keep going.

1558
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,080
What is this?

1559
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:59,130
Guys.

1560
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:01,610
Guys.

1561
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,890
There's like this channel.

1562
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,750
Whos that keep going?

1563
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:10,970
AHHHHHH!

1564
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:15,990
Anyway, anyway so there's like this channel.

1565
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,010
By the way.

1566
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,910
There's like this channel.

1567
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:19,990
I didn't watch the ending of that.

1568
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:23,370
I just need you guys to know I just saw the star scream and I thought that was cool.

1569
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,370
I didn't watch the ending.

1570
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:25,970
I didn't...

1571
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,150
I...

1572
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:30,170
I...

1573
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,170
Okay.

1574
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:33,890
So like there are like two videos showing up like this full screen.

1575
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,950
There's like these random Russian channels.

1576
01:17:37,110 --> 01:18:06,950
I don't know if it's like I can't tell if it's deepfake or not But like I think it's deepfake because people are like debating debating it in comments and Oh, sorry Megatron People were debating about it in in like comments whether or not these are like deepfakes or or actual or like actual uh Like what's it?

Like he carved scales.

1615
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,860
He actually carved scales out of a fucking styrofoam.

1616
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,500
Yeah, he's making the dragon.

1617
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,440
What the fuck the head?

1618
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,060
Get this guy a 3D print.

1619
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:34,360
Like, this is styrofoam.

1620
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,600
This is better than 3D printer.

1621
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,660
Bro, this is handmade.

1622
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,820

01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:07,980
Not only can he make, not only can he make like whole uh like props for his figures, but he can make a fucking figure himself.

1628
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,020
He doesn't even need to buy figures anymore.

1629
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,060
He can literally make them.

1630
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,360
What's the channel name?

1631
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,060
It's a Yoshi channel.

1632
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,660
Got a 3D printer.

1633
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,800
If any kid destroys this, he can make it again.

01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,530

1644
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,190
Okay, I'm trying to find...

1645
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,250
Alright, let's see.

1646
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:05,950
Oh, this one I saw was pretty funny.

1647
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:10,310
I wish gender reveals were as fun as this.

1648
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,720
Do you want a boy?

1649
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,290
How is this normal?

1650
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:27,810
This should be the norm for gender reveals.

1651
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,330
Dude, I...

1652
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:32,670
I'm tired.

1653
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,250
Oh my god, he did like the Undertaker.

1654
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:40,110
Don't be pleased to find normal.

1655
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,770
This should be normal!

1656
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:47,550
I'm tired of the force fires that be started because of gender reveals.

1657
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,670
I'm so tired.

1658
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,090
I'm so tired.

1659
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:54,170
And the cakes too!

1660
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,190
Cakes aren't original!

1661
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,170
Much less property damage.

1662
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,110
Exactly!

1663
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,970
It's a boy!

1664
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:06,910
Also, there is...

1665
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:07,790
Which one was it?

1666
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:10,190
Let's see.

1667
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:10,870
What are things...

1668
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:12,110
What was I going to show you guys?

1669
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:20,650
Uh...

1670
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:23,670
There's like videos I've liked as well.

1671
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:25,710
Let me look through my archives.

1672
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,690
Oh my god!

1673
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:27,510
I love watching these!

1674
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:34,530
So like, these are like tours around like cool places in Japan.

1675
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:39,450
And there's one where it's like literally a town dedicated to dinosaurs.

1676
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:46,010
So like, I was watching this and it's like a whole train that's just dinos.

1677
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,030
Hahaha!

1678
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,790
It's like a dinosaur train!

1679
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:50,910
I thought it was so cool!

1680
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:55,050
I was like, this is so cute!

1681
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,330
I wanna be on this train!

1682
01:25:58,450 --> 01:25:59,330
Name, please?

1683
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,890
It's called Itsuka Japan.

1684
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:04,090
Japan's largest dinosaur museum.

1685
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,170
It's so... it's so...

1686
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:08,190
interesting.

1687
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:09,830
It's like...

1688
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,690
It's like those like trains that are themed.

1689
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,670
So like there's like Pokemon themed trains.

1690
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:15,770
And like...

1691
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,790
and like others.

1692
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,050
But this one's Dino themed.

1693
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:19,410
Look!

1694
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:19,890
Oh my god!

1695
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:20,910
There's a T-Rex head!

1696
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:23,670
I was watching this video like a couple of weeks ago.

1697
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:26,610
It's so cool!

1698
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,130
So you ride this train to go to the museum.

1699
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:31,850
It's so cute!

1700
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:34,490
There's like so many interesting ones.

1701
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:35,970
And there's like...

1702
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:36,550
Oh, this one.

1703
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:37,390
This one's scary.

1704
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:40,970
I wanna be on this train!

1705
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:43,050
Clever girl!

1706
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:48,650
He watched the pretty random videos!

1707
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:55,230
I just... I don't know!

1708
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:55,690
I just...

1709
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:58,110
I'm very cultured, I guess.

1710
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,890
I watch a lot of fucking random videos.

1711
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,310
I grew up on the internet.

1712
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:06,130
Finally a normal video.

1713
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,970
My algorithm is like crazy.

1714
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:12,530
I just watch like different stuff.

1715
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:15,570
I'm not... I don't like just watch funny videos.

1716
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,630
I watch like craft videos and stuff.

1717
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:21,750
An insight into Doki's mind!

1718
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:22,770
Look at that!

1719
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,470
It's so cute!

1720
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,130
Oh, what's the next to this?

1721
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,870
And then there's like a museum.

1722
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,750
It's just a museum dedicated to it and stuff.

1723
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:36,990
So there's like dino themed food and everything.

1724
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:38,650
And...

1725
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:40,670
What's this?

1726
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:41,150
Oh my god!

1727
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:41,550
Merch!

1728
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,570
Buy my merch!

1729
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:43,930
Anyway, so...

1730
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,490
I thought this channel was really interesting.

1731
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:46,850
I enjoy it.

1732
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,070
Because they tour around Japan.

1733
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:51,450
Showing like interesting themed places and stuff.

1734
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,730
And then... Oh my god!

1735
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,810
Okay, this is one of my favorite craft videos.

1736
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,730
I don't know if you know this.

1737
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:04,010
They make like clay.

1738
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:05,930
Wuzu clay.

1739
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,310
I really enjoy their stuff.

1740
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,170
It's so cute.

1741
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,250
And very peaceful.

1742
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:14,870
They mostly do like Minecraft because of the algorithm.

1743
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,010
Uh...

1744
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:24,270
But I found the way they do like the clay art to be like really creative.

1745
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:36,720
Like I like the little template they use to help make the clay art.

1746
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,660
Minecraft IRL.

1747
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:39,980
Yeah!

1748
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:40,780
That's what he does!

1749
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:41,960
So interesting.

1750
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,570
And they put this piece together.

1751
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:52,830
Put it together!

1752
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,450
It's so peaceful.

1753
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:06,070
But you can see that it slowly becomes...

1754
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,990
Like look at that!

1755
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:08,890
Oh my god, it's all coming together.

1756
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:16,020
It's very satisfying.

1757
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,460
What a submarine!

1758
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,560
It's a fucking Minecraft shipwreck.

1759
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:41,710
And they're making the...

1760
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,410
What are they making?

1761
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,030
Are they making a box?

1762
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,310
The bottom base of it, I think?

1763
01:29:46,730 --> 01:29:49,210
Yeah, so they're making the sand and the...

1764
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:51,050
The sand biome.

1765
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,630
So nice.

1766
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,170
Very relaxing.

1767
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:01,470
I can do that.

1768
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:04,270
Yeah?

1769
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,610
Where's your 2 million subscribers channel?

1770
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:08,830
Where is it?

1771
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,640
Where is it?

1772
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,820
Oh my god, it fits perfectly!

1773
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,330
Ba la la la la.

1774
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,990
I like how there's like Christmas background music in the background.

1775
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:26,590
Where's yours?

1776
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,270
Exactly.

1777
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:33,930
That is why I'm not talented enough, and I said I yoink people's content for react.

1778
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:42,490
That's why That's why I don't have 2 million subscribers.

1779
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,870
Let's go react at these.

1780
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:51,490
Hey, what's that?

1781
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:55,410
Oh, that's not the seaweed, right?

1782
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,590
I haven't watched this video yet.

1783
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:00,370
I watched his other clay videos.

1784
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:06,950
Oh my god, imagine like, putting...

1785
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:09,890
Those could be like, surgeon fingers too.

1786
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:12,890
I feel like instead of becoming a surgeon...

1787
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,570
It's either you be a surgeon with those...

1788
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,030
With those like, steady hands, or like...

1789
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:19,570
Or a crafter.

1790
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:23,770
Yeah, the tiny details.

1791
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:24,690
And then the coral!

1792
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,510
Oh my god, they're all broken!

1793
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:32,190
This could, but this is...

1794
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:32,810
Yeah,

1795
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:37,850
that's so fucking tiny!

1796
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:41,410
Oh, I love Tiny Kitchen.

1797
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:42,850
I watch their stuff too.

1798
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:44,690
I love Tiny Kitchen.

1799
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:47,110
Grab it!

1800
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:48,150
Thank you for the tier 1 stuff!

1801
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,050
Thank you, thank you!

1802
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,990
And the tiny sea pickles.

1803
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:54,070
And then the coral and the seaweed.

1804
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,610
And then the tiny boat!

1805
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:57,390
God,

1806
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:01,450
with a chest!

1807
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,890
That's so cute!

1808
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:06,730
It's so tiny!

1809
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,670
Oh my god, there's Jack Black!

1810
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:13,230
Hahaha!

1811
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:23,630
Tony, please!

1812
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:26,770
It's true!

1813
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:29,650
Jack Black's gonna be Steve in Minecraft!

1814
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:32,050
You guys didn't know that?

1815
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:33,610
It's so cute.

1816
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:37,230
Finally, Jack Black is real.

1817
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:39,230
Oh, the tiny axolotl!

1818
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,190
Yeah, I'm serious!

1819
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:52,870
He's gonna be Steve in Minecraft!

1820
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:54,130
They just finished filming!

1821
01:32:55,950 --> 01:33:00,590
Oh my god, the axolotl is so cute!

1822
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:02,950
Oh!

1823
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,270
I love his stuff.

1824
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,520
And then you're gonna add resin.

1825
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,520
I love the crafting channels.

1826
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,500
They're so relaxing to watch.

1827
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,800
I thought she was joking.

1828
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,180
Holy shit, it's so tiny!

1829
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:56,360
Next to the Lego?

1830
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,000
I didn't realize how tiny it was!

1831
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,320
And then you're gonna put resin on it.

1832
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:37,990
Wait, they're making their own diorama!

1833
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:42,610
My god!

1834
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:47,450
They didn't even buy a diorama, they made their own diorama!

1835
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:56,310
Oh god, pushing that down would make me so scared!

1836
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:00,810
Yeah, they made their little wood stand!

1837
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:04,530
I'd be so scared pushing that down.

1838
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,670
And so they have to mix the resin.

1839
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:17,990
The thing about resin is that it has to be like 50-50 exactly.

1840
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:19,950
Because of chemistry.

1841
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:22,410
If it's not 50-50 exactly...

1842
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:23,790
You fuck up the resin.

1843
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,760
It's so good!

1844
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,700
And the air bubbles make sense because it's water.

1845
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:38,260
Holy shit!

1846
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,240
Are they gonna take off the...

1847
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,620
Are they gonna take off the glass part or are they gonna keep that in?

1848
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,620
Oh, I guess they'll keep that in.

1849
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,900
It's so sick!

1850
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:55,480
I know!

1851
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,140
He's so talented!

1852
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:58,120
I love his stuff!

1853
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,960
Yeah, you fuck up the resin and it's done for.

1854
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,180
You have to remake the whole thing.

1855
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,200
I know it's so good!

1856
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,200
I love his shit!

1857
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,380
I love his works.

1858
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,900
It's actually so good.

1859
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:13,580
Everything is like super precise and everything.

1860
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,180
Alright, now that we're talking about crafting channel...

1861
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,120
Let me show you guys another...

1862
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,580
Another craft person that I like to watch.

1863
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,560
Let me see if I can find it.

1864
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,000
Let's see.

1865
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,440
Where is it?

1866
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,540
I love watching craft channels.

1867
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,580
It's like my life.

1868
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,500
It's wuzu clay.

1869
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,240
Oh, there.

1870
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,240
I love like these like...

1871
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,080
Pokemon cards dioramas too.

1872
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,860
I think these are...

1873
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,320
Really unique.

1874
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,780
Like the 3D card dioramas.

1875
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,960
That stuff is... That's like... That's so pretty.

1876
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:58,060
Those are really cool.

1877
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,380
Yeah.

1878
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:06,770
And because they need like multiple too.

1879
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:08,650
They need more than one card to make this.

1880
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:10,370
So they have to like...

1881
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:12,950
Like they want to use like authentic Pokemon cards.

1882
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:14,870
So like they have to make...

1883
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,510
Buy like multiple copies of it.

1884
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,800
I love Doll Life.

1885
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,720
Doll Life was one of my favorite doll creators.

1886
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,360
And also speaking of dolls.

1887
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,660
Because I saw a lot of people like...

1888
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:34,260
The Doki Bird doll dropped from Moonlight Jewel as well.

1889
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,800
I love watching doll videos.

1890
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,260
But like the Doki Bird doll video dropped as well.

1891
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,980
I haven't watched it yet.

1892
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,160
Like oh...

1893
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:47,560
Look.

1894
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,940
Holy shit.

1895
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:49,880
It's so pretty.

1896
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,440
I want...

1897
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,680
I want like a Doki Bird card diorama.

1898
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,320
One day in the future.

1899
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:58,020
That's so pretty.

1900
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,560
Like oh my god.

1901
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,520
It's so good.

1902
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:02,720
Alright before we do.

1903
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,240
We should like watch something fucked up.

1904
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:06,040
Before we watch something normal.

1905
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,380
Man I wish I could show like...

1906
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,060
Some of the animation channels I watch.

1907
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,240
But the humor in it might...

1908
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:20,720
Is like really fucked up.

1909
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,340
Because I told you guys like...

1910
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:24,840
So my favorite animation channel is like...

1911
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,340
There's Cass.

1912
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,100
There's Flash Gitz.

1913
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,060
And there's Meat Canyon.

1914
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,900
But like I feel like...

1915
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,960
What if I show you guys...

1916
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:40,400
The humor's not for everybody.

1917
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:41,340
But like...

1918
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,000
Those are...

1919
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,360
That's my humor.

1920
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,420
That's technically my humor.

1921
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,400
Let's see.

1922
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:52,580
Oh...

1923
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,440
I saw like this song for learning Japanese.

1924
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,920
And I thought it was like...

1925
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,480
Really cute.

1926
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:01,980
Look.

1927
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,980
This is by...

1928
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,880
Let's learn Japanese today.

1929
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,460
For those who need to learn Japanese,

1930
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,780
this is not actually helpful!

1931
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:42,040
Okay, the reason why is that I saw this version of it, which was really nice.

1932
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:12,880
This is how Doki learns Japanese.

1933
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,060
That's...

1934
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:17,600
That's cute that you think that I'm ever gonna learn Japanese.

1935
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,100
My brain...

1936
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:26,820
My brain cannot fit another language.

1937
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,980
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

1938
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:36,420
Not with that attitude.

1939
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,820
We've tried.

1940
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:40,720
We've tried so many times.

1941
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:41,900
Guys...

1942
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,140
That's cute that you guys think I'm ever gonna learn.

1943
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,060
That's so true.

1944
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,500
Let's see.

1945
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,160
What else?

1946
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:55,620
What else do I want to show you guys?

1947
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,100
Let's look at the...

1948
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,020
Oh my god!

1949
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,820
Okay, have you guys seen those rug videos?

1950
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,160
I've been watching...

1951
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,900
I've been watching the people make rug...

1952
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:13,240
Okay, a lot of the videos I watch is actually just like relaxing videos too.

1953
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,540
Like some of my favorite channels.

1954
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,920
But I love watching people make rugs.

1955
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:18,440
I don't know why.

1956
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,040
I just think it's like super soothing.

1957
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,600
It's so interesting too.

1958
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:26,720
The rug making videos.

1959
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:27,820
No, not the cleaning ones.

1960
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,800
I just watch people make rugs.

1961
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,040
That's it.

1962
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,500
That's it.

1963
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,160
I literally watch people make rugs.

1964
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:45,850
That's it.

1965
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:46,030
I literally watch people make rugs.

1966
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:46,430
Nice too.

1967
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:47,930
The ASMR of it.

1968
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,010
It sounds so relaxing.

1969
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,190
It's so talented too.

1970
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:57,450
Because you have to be like super precise with everything.

1971
01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,530
Oh, look at that.

1972
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:02,030
And then trimming it all.

1973
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:05,250
And then making it so that like things are...

1974
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:09,250
Making it so that these are more bumpy than the others.

1975
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,610
Oh, I've seen the art restoration videos.

1976
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:13,710
Yeah, I have.

1977
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:15,730
Look at that.

1978
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:16,010
Oh my god.

1979
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:17,310
I want this rug.

1980
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:19,350
Can someone make a Doki Bird rug?

1981
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:26,290
Alright, let's watch the doll video.

1982
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:27,450
I haven't watched it yet.

1983
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:29,890
I saved it though.

1984
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,650
Here it is.

1985
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:32,270
Hey ho.

1986
01:42:32,410 --> 01:42:37,750
So if you guys have been watching me for a while you probably know that I have made some Vtuber dolls in the past.

1987
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,210
That's me.

1988
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,010
I'm a Vtuber.

1989
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:41,910
I love doll making videos.

1990
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:46,090
I thought how about I make another Vtuber doll before I make my own doll.

1991
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:49,530
I'm taking a tiny break from posting because planning my wedding is a lot.

1992
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:59,990
Amazingly enough, the decision who to make was made pretty easy when I saw that the amazing Doki Bird hosted a cherry stream and searched for artists to participate in that.

1993
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:05,870
The artworks and items that the artists offered would then be auctioned off and the proceeds would go to cherry.

1994
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:13,390
So I applied, got accepted, and offered a slot of a custom Doki Bird doll that will go with your new home as well.

1995
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:16,450
Which is what we are going to do today.

1996
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:21,710
As always, Blue Pixie did an amazing job by already sculpting a beautiful face and some of her accessories.

1997
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:27,370
So how about we get my 3D printer and some resin prepped and start this project by printing the doll.

1998
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,540
Holy shit, what the fuck is that?

1999
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,180
What is that machine?

2000
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:45,180
Is that a 3D printer?

2001
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:46,960
Wait, what?

2002
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,020
Are 3D printers like that now?

2003
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,140
Oh my god, that has to be a fucking...

2004
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,500
Oh, it's a resin printer?

2005
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:56,580
They can 3D print resin now?

2006
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:58,400
Wait, that's insane.

2007
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,440
That has to be crazy expensive.

2008
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:09,500
Oh my god, those are my legs.

2009
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:11,620
Whoa.

2010
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,560
Naked.

2011
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:19,000
I really love the little smug smile on her face and I'm happy that the printing and assembling went so well.

2012
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,780
And now that the preparations are done, we can now actually start working on the doll.

2013
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:23,980
Does that have the project?

2014
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,380
How about we make her wake?

2015
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,540
Holy shit, wait, I'm thick.

2016
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,520
I have those thighs.

2017
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,120
Wait.

2018
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:37,940
One recent trend that I picked up was people telling their own stories through short form content.

2019
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:39,540
I think the cat is coming.

2020
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:46,300
I wanted to learn more about this subject and then found this class from Haleaza Navarra.

2021
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,260
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna skip your ad.

2022
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:50,880
It's Skillshare.

2023
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:57,720
But like, she reminded me of this other channel that I really like to watch.

2024
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:58,460
I think it's nerdy.

2025
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:59,560
What was it?

2026
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,060
It's also a crafting channel too.

2027
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,460
Her personality reminds me of that channel where it's...

2028
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,260
I'm trying to remember.

2029
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,380
They make really cool gaming stuff as well.

2030
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:18,320
They once made a custom PC that was inspired by Cyberpunk.

2031
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:19,880
I'm trying to remember the name.

2032
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,100
I should watch some of their stuff.

2033
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,000
NerdForge!

2034
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:22,320
Yes!

2035
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,860
I love NerdForge!

2036
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:26,440
NerdForge is one of my favorite channels.

2037
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:26,900
It's so cool.

2038
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:31,920
An essential item that I found recently for making wigs is this matte styling wax.

2039
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,600
Because with this you can really mold the hair into shape.

2040
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:35,220
It's amazing.

2041
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:43,640
To make Ducky's bangs a little more spiky, I thin out the hair by vertically cutting into them and then use the styling wax and heat to mold them in shape.

2042
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:47,440
The curling wand is an excellent tool for flattening down the hair as well.

2043
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:52,400
When I was satisfied with the look, I then proceed and glue, cut, and style her heme bangs.

2044
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:58,360
The front of her hairstyle was actually not that easy to mimic which is why I decided to start the wig with it this time.

2045
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:02,580
The heme bangs are kind of layered and it was a bit tricky to make that work.

2046
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:03,440
My hair that complicated?

2047
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:07,880
I feel like the skin suit has to be like easier.

2048
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,040
I love my skin suit.

2049
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,040
The skin suit was easier.

2050
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:15,720
And then finally start on the back of the head.

2051
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,820
For the pigtail look I will go around here in the direction of the pigtails on the back of her head.

2052
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:24,260
Afterwards it looks a bit messy and believe me it was.

2053
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:28,280
But I basically just had to pull all the glued hair into a pigtail.

2054
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:35,980
And then for the final layers I prepped a bunch of folded around glued wefts which I now will be using to create all the parting lines on the wig.

2055
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:45,260
This was a lot of work and I've been working on the wig for the whole day already and it was evening and I was pretty tired so I did that off camera.

2056
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,520
Oh my god look at all that hair.

2057
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,540
There's so many hairs too.

2058
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:52,480
Ava thank you for the rain!

2059
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,160
Thank you thank you!

2060
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:54,460
Yeah!

2061
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,440
Hello everybody!

2062
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,780
It's me Ducky DuckyBraid.

2063
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:03,980
I do the stream on the YouTube but today I'm on Twitch because I'm a React Andy today.

2064
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:10,260
Oh my gosh the ribbon is so cute!

2065
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,000
Oh my gosh the ribbon is so cute!

2066
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,300
On which I now can finally attach the ribbons with some hot glue.

2067
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:22,180
I actually did try to make Ducky's head out of fabric but I failed miserably.

2068
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:28,560
So Blue came to the rescue here and sculpted Ducky's head so I could then CD print it in resin.

2069
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:28,580
Wait the hat's so cute!

2070
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:28,920
That's so pretty!

2071
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,900
And then I just have to simply paint it according to Ducky's style of artwork.

2072
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:33,160
Hats are very hard to make in general.

2073
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:43,940
I love how broad it looks and will now also glue it to the wig so that it won't fall off and potentially break in worst case since resin is a little bit more brittle than filament and tends to break more easily.

2074
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:48,200
The finished wig looks so cute already and I'm really proud of the little bows.

2075
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:53,000
I'm not a fan of making pig tail wigs but I love how they look in the end.

2076
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:54,840
Let's paint Ducky's face next.

2077
01:47:55,140 --> 01:48:01,320
Lupixi did such a nice job sculpting it that you can already tell by the sculpt itself that it is really Ducky Bird.

2078
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:05,080
As always I'm giving the face some sheen with pearly shimmers.

2079
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:11,460
You can really go a bit overboard with them as sealing them with Mr. Super Clear later on will make them disappear a little again.

2080
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:15,140
I also add a little bit of blushing to different areas of the face.

2081
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:23,220
I know anime faces tend to look more flat so adding a little bit more blushing... I think that's like the hardest part with uh...

2082
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:32,680
the hardest part with like painting figures is to make it not like one dimensional type deal and adding shading.

2083
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,160
I think that's like the hardest part.

2084
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:39,080
I've seen so many like custom figures and stuff that like um...

2085
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:45,060
that like forget to do like the important parts of shading cause it's so hard to make it look bright as well.

2086
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:50,180
I then can finally go in with black acrylic paint and carefully line the lashes with it.

2087
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:54,900
Of course I also have to line Ducky's cute little smug smile using some gouache paint.

2088
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:58,220
Mistakes can be carefully scratched away with an exacto knife.

2089
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:58,840
So cute!

2090
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:06,420
To give the eyebrows a little bit more of a blonde look I decided to use a little bit of pastel yellow on the middle of them and I really like the look.

2091
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:15,180
For the finishing touches of the face I'm using my favorite iridescent sparkly shimmers on her cheeks and forehead before sealing her off for the final time.

2092
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:20,980
To make Ducky's eyes I made these tiny templates on my iPad and printed them onto some cardboard paper.

2093
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:24,880
I'm then taking my half sphere mold and will use the third biggest one.

2094
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:32,160
Using some UV resin I drop one drop of it into the mold and then place the iris onto the resin upside down like this.

2095
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:37,100
I let it cure for a minute and then add some white UV resin that I mixed with some white resin pigment.

2096
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:41,120
I cure it again for about three minutes and then it's time to demold the eye.

2097
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:42,940
And it's for me!

2098
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:43,900
Oh my god!

2099
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:55,160
This happened because my mold might be a little old at this point and this rhymes but don't worry we're here to rescue it because I can simply use some UV top coat and gloss it over.

2100
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:59,720
And to make the resin spread evenly I can use a lighter and then cure it in my UV lamp.

2101
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:04,540
The first eyes look like this and I think they're really pretty and super shiny.

2102
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:09,760
Honestly, that's not a surprise.

2103
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,360
Honestly, that's not a surprise.

2104
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,280
So cute!

2105
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:18,340
The face already looks so much like Docky so I absolutely cannot wait to make her outfit next.

2106
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:24,220
To make Docky's outfit I actually really had to think how to even be able to realize it.

2107
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:33,620
In the end I opted to make an underdress with the white top part and a layered skirt and then basically make a black dress topper separately.

2108
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:37,140
And of course then make the jacket, accessories and shoes.

2109
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:39,860
So how about we start with the underdress first.

2110
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,040
First let's make the skirt of Docky's dress.

2111
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:48,060
Since it has three layers and little white strips on them, I decided to cut the strips from white fabric vinyl.

2112
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:52,600
I think fabric vinyl has such a nice and neat finish that I really enjoy using it.

2113
01:50:52,700 --> 01:51:01,380
After cutting I just have to weed it out and here you can see I cut three ruffled pieces from blue fabric already and will iron on those vinyl strips onto them first.

2114
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:06,440
I'm just like thinking how expensive all of the machinery for to make these custom dolls.

2115
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:08,740
Especially like resin dolls too.

2116
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:13,400
I'm going to make the bottom top seams of the smaller strips by gluing them around.

2117
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:17,640
As you can see I also pulled in some gathering threads and now gathered the ruffles.

2118
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:41,360
It was a bit tricky to do so but in the end they looked Have you guys seen this like fashion designer that does like pop culture like does like outfits inspired by like movies and TV shows and like cartoons and then she did one from like the Rogers Rabbit the unrealistic expectations of women outfit What's her name?

2119
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:43,960
What's her name?

2120
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:48,920
She did like from Roger Rabbit Jessica.

2121
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,200
Yeah Jessica Rabbit.

2122
01:51:50,520 --> 01:52:05,840
Have you guys seen that there's like this like YouTuber she does like very little she does like she doesn't upload a lot of videos but she she has like almost a million subscribers from the very few videos that she has uploaded because it's just so good.

2123
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,220
I'll show it to you guys later.

2124
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,600
It's actually insane.

2125
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:12,200
I saw the short of it and then I watched the video.

2126
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:19,060
So I basically had to go back to the drawing board and try to figure out how to make this skirt look better.

2127
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,600
I ended up going with a pleated look instead.

2128
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,880
So I prepped some new strips for the skirt and cleaned them up.

2129
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:32,520
Then I sewed the two bottom pleated parts to a tool strip and then attached the top You have to be like a mini like you have to know how to do clothes for this.

2130
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:35,600
And then I pressed the pleats according to the markings on the top pleated part.

2131
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:41,760
For the top part of Ducky's dress I cut this right fabric piece and then attached a little casing to it on top of it.

2132
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:48,760
I sew it, press it, and then stitch it down like this so I can now pull in a little rubber thread through the tunnel that we just created.

2133
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:59,860
If you have trouble threading in threads like this through needles you can just use some tape, attach it to the end of the thread, cut it into a tip, and then thread it through the needle like this.

2134
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:03,520
This is just such a good trick I learned recently that I had to share it with you guys.

2135
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,700
And then I just proceed and thread the rubber band into the top.

2136
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:14,820
When that was done successfully I then add a gathering thread onto the bottom part of the top piece and gather it to the length of the blue lower part of the top.

2137
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,500
I pin it together and sew it finished sides in.

2138
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:22,580
Afterwards it looks like this and as you can see I already pinned the back parts into the dress as well.

2139
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:26,120
And then I also just sew them on good sides in.

2140
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:26,740
And boom!

2141
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:28,280
A cute cat appeared.

2142
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,760
A very important assistant I might say.

2143
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:39,660
Here you can see the finished skirt and now I can take the finished top part of the dress and pin it to the skirt before sewing the skirt and top together finished sides in.

2144
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:42,200
My cat at this point had enough of me in sims.

2145
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,020
She was however very interested in the glue cap.

2146
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:52,300
The sewn together dress looks like this and I now just have to pin together the back seam and sew it together about 2.5 inches.

2147
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,680
Leaving just enough of a gap for the closure.

2148
01:53:54,860 --> 01:54:04,700
The finished dress turned out so good and you can see that even though I have been making dolls for years sometimes I have to remake things in order to make them look better and more accurate.

2149
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,400
And that's okay!

2150
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,780
We learn from mistakes sometimes.

2151
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:07,260
That's amazing.

2152
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,540
Let's make the black topper that Docky wears on top of her dress next.

2153
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:15,500
I prepped the fabric pieces with white vinyl strips already and will now sew together the side seams I'm bringing the cat back.

2154
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,220
Where is my kitty cam?

2155
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:25,040
I will now attach the blue lining pieces on which I also iron on some white vinyl strips next.

2156
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:28,920
I place them onto the black parts good sides in and hem them on.

2157
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:34,620
When flapping around the lining parts it really looks like Docky's dress and will close like this in the end.

2158
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:44,060
I already cut and prep the skirt for the topper by cleaning up the bottom seams and attaching a gathering part and will now gather the skirt to match the seam line of the upper part.

2159
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:49,920
And make sure to spread the gathering evenly and fill the skirt and top part together before handing them finished sides in.

2160
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:55,240
At the moment it looks like this and I cursed with a needle to show you guys how to look in the end.

2161
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:59,100
For closure we will be attaching two new snap buttons to the top.

2162
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,980
These smart buttons work really nicely for doll clothing.

2163
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:05,220
Last but not least I will be gluing some tiny golden half feet.

2164
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:10,420
It's like designers like manga manga artists and like anime artists.

2165
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:15,580
Dude the design is to make like clothes that look cool not like actually real.

2166
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:20,760
With these final steps the dress topper is done and I'm super happy how it turned out.

2167
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,740
It looks so much like Docky's outfit.

2168
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:29,800
I think especially the little details like the blue lining part with the white stripes really make it look very accurate to the original.

2169
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,640
Art cares not for gravity.

2170
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:38,700
For Docky's jacket I first take the sleeves that I cut from grey cotton fabric and wrap them by pulling and gathering threads on the top and bottom seams.

2171
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:47,920
I then gather the lower part of them and take these tiny little cuffs that I prepped by ironing them in half and now pin them to the gathered sleeve parts and sew them on.

2172
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:53,020
When done with that the sleeves look really cute already and I can now also gather the top part of them.

2173
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:59,440
I then set them aside for a bit and first will sew on the facing for the raglan collar to the bodice of the jacket.

2174
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:04,560
Of course I fray checked all my fabric pieces to make sure they won't fray before I sew them on.

2175
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,580
And after sewing on and steaming the face of the collar it looks like this.

2176
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:11,760
Folding around the collar it will look like this and maybe makes a little bit of sense like that.

2177
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:17,160
And now I can finally take the prepped sleeves and sew them onto the bodice of the jacket with magic.

2178
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:25,500
Last but not least I take my cat and gently push her out of the way so I can show you that I just needed to close the sleeve and side seams of the jacket still.

2179
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:28,860
I pin them together neatly and try to match up all the seams.

2180
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:35,160
I'm just sewing I then put the jacket onto my logo though so I can exactly determine where to place the black ribbon.

2181
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,900
I heard that was like the hardest part.

2182
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,860
I pinned it before and now careful.

2183
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:41,560
Okay sorry this is off topic cause someone mentioned Kingdom Hearts.

2184
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:47,440
You know how like the Smash Brothers trailer for Sora has no Donald and Goofy?

2185
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:50,580
Cause getting Sora on his own was really hard.

2186
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,500
Getting Disney characters in Smash Brothers.

2187
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,880
Like okay this is the perfect cut by the way.

2188
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,200
The perfect angle for you guys.

2189
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:12,640
But if you notice um if you notice in the Kingdom Hearts Smash Brothers reveal trailer there's no Donald or Goofy at all.

2190
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,460
There's no reference to Donald or Goofy.

2191
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:21,760
And even then getting the Mickey Mouse keychain on the keyblade was in itself incredibly difficult to do.

2192
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:25,180
Because like you know Disney was like mmm I don't know.

2193
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:35,720
The horizontal strip is the final touch and will attach to the opposite side of the jacket with a little Velcro on the inside.

2194
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:42,680
The finished jacket looks so cute and I think I'm happy that I was able to make it really similar to the original model.

2195
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:49,000
So now translating 2D designs into 3D is really difficult but it's a challenge that I really enjoy conquering.

2196
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,340
Feels like mini cosplay somehow.

2197
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:53,980
Did I actually ever tell you that I used to cosplay back in the day?

2198
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,160
Pre Moonlight Jewel times.

2199
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:56,980
Let's make Ducky's boots next.

2200
01:57:57,240 --> 01:58:03,060
I cut the boots pieces from blue fabric already and first sewed together the front seam but then just about half an inch.

2201
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:09,100
After sewing and ironing it, it looks like this and I can now proceed to glue around the seam allowance of the upper boot part.

2202
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:18,400
I then take this strip I cut from white fabric covered in fabric vinyl which I also already cleaned up on one side and will now pin it to the boot like this and sew it.

2203
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:24,540
It looks really neat after sewing so I can now flap around the upper boot part like this and make sure it stays in place.

2204
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:27,060
For that I carefully sew with my eye.

2205
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:37,320
I then glue around the back seam allowance of the boot and instead of the zipper totally not because I completely forgot to order some, I will attach an elastic fabric on the back of the boot this time.

2206
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,720
I first glue around the top seam of the elastic fabric and then pin it to the boot piece like this.

2207
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,900
By my silence!

2208
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,520
And glue the rest with contact adhesive.

2209
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:53,860
Afterwards it looks really neat and it worked better than I thought so the next thing I need to do is closing the little bottom seam on the back of the boot.

2210
01:58:53,980 --> 01:59:00,240
And after that was done, I turn the boot inside out and finally close the rest of the front seam good sides in.

2211
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,840
I turn it inside out again so... Will you see me sponsored by Disney?

2212
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:03,540
You would know.

2213
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,840
I now glue it on one of the Nova Dogs to finish the boot.

2214
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:12,060
I cut a cardboard sole from an old cereal packaging and will now glue the bottom of the boot to the bottom of the cardboard sole like this.

2215
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,480
Cardboard sole is tough to say.

2216
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:20,400
For the shoemaces I printed these guide boys that grew sculpts and now have to paint the toecaps with them black.

2217
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:25,460
I also prep these tiny buckles I cut from PVC covered in silver vinyl on my laser cutter.

2218
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,020
And now take tiny pleather strips and thread them through the buckles first.

2219
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:34,480
As you can see I attach one set of buckle straps to the boot already and will now do the same to the other.

2220
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:42,280
I simply attach them with glue and afterwards can finally glue the upper boot part to the shoe base using some woohoo all purpose glue.

2221
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:48,800
Last but not least I just attach a tiny golden star to the boot as well and with this last step the boots are also done.

2222
01:59:48,960 --> 02:00:00,480
I decided to make them from fabric rather than pleather because you can see that on Ducky's original artwork the boots do actually have some wrinkles and I think the fabric choice resembles this perfectly here.

2223
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,720
Alright the main part of the outfit is done.

2224
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,760
Let's make all of Ducky's accessories.

2225
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:11,000
For her stocking I will be using an actual human tights with stripes like this and cut out the stocking pattern from it.

2226
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:17,740
I then clean up the other seam with glue and then can fold the fabric good size in and sew the back seam of the stocking.

2227
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:20,720
Afterwards it looks like this and this stocking is already done.

2228
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:28,540
For Ducky's choker I first cut this piece from white leather fabric and then take this tiny white lace and glue it to the upper part of the choker.

2229
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:33,860
I will do the exact same to the bottom part of the choker as well and end up with something like this.

2230
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:42,500
Now I carefully glue a tiny satin ribbon to the front of the choker and also add this tiny prepped folded ribbon to the middle of the choker as well.

2231
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,040
Oh well I at least tried to.

2232
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:52,720
For the final step I take this tiny golden star and attach it to the middle of the just attached satin ribbon and with a tiny velcro on the back Did you even intend it?

2233
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:54,800
I didn't even know my boots were made of fabric guys.

2234
02:00:57,620 --> 02:01:00,940
Everyone said it's all about aesthetic instead of practicality.

2235
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:02,280
That's what I mean.

2236
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,260
I didn't even know.

2237
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:04,480
I learned something new today.

2238
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:07,360
I was like whoa my boots are fabric?

2239
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:10,980
To really bond the two components I use a little metal roll.

2240
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,380
It's a really nice tool for that.

2241
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:22,140
I proceed and cut the tiny back pieces from the material off cam and now first attach some glue to the back inside of the back to be able to attach the little side strip to it.

2242
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:27,160
Afterwards I attach the front piece in the same fashion and end up with this little bag.

2243
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:28,520
Oh it's a bag!

2244
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:31,380
It's the bag for all my seaming tools.

2245
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,360
I don't know you guys know this.

2246
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,540
I'm a thief by the way.

2247
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:41,280
I don't know if you guys forgot or not.

2248
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,740
A small magnet as a closure.

2249
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:49,220
I glued it to the top part already and now we'll attach the bottom magnet as well with some super glue.

2250
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:51,960
When it was dry the back opens and closes nicely.

2251
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,680
Yeah it's like where I put all the tools to do the thieving things, you know?

2252
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:57,300
Like the thief tools.

2253
02:01:57,420 --> 02:01:57,960
Yeah.

2254
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:01,880
Doki what's in... what tools does thief use?

2255
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:04,540
You know... thieving stuff.

2256
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:10,720
You know... those tools!

2257
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:20,000
I added these teeny tiny decorations to the back as well with some glue and tweezers and finish off the little leg bag like that as well.

2258
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:21,920
Only one more accessory to make.

2259
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:22,580
The glue gloves!

2260
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:29,380
For these I simply take a folded and cleaned up rectangle cut from jersey fabric and will sew them along the short seam.

2261
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:32,080
Just leaving open a tiny gap for Doki's thumb.

2262
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,720
Kind of the same way I made Iron Mouse's gloves back in the day.

2263
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:41,420
I can then simply put them into the hands like this and I really love this easy but nice technique of making fingerless gloves for my dolls.

2264
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:45,560
And with that all accessories for Doki Bird's doll are finally done.

2265
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:52,260
Making accessories is definitely my favorite thing to do because crafting is something that I've been loving ever since I was a kid.

2266
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:52,560
I was 50% done with those gloves.

2267
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:54,800
I'm especially proud of that little leg bag.

2268
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:01,580
Okay so the doll is actually done at this point but for those of you who know me you probably know Best piece ever!

2269
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:02,800
Exactly.

2270
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,040
The doll stand.

2271
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:10,960
I have conveniently vectorized the logo already so how about we make that stand now with a final little montage.

2272
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,840
Oh it's so pretty!

2273
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:28,200
That's like my logo!

2274
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,600
Oh my god!

2275
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:34,880
Wait that's the stand?

2276
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:38,020
Oh I love it!

2277
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,940
Like the laser cut of the acrylic.

2278
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:49,920
And with that the doll stand is also done and I can finally assemble the doll completely for the very first time.

2279
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,160
And I was absolutely blown away by her how cute she turned out to be.

2280
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:54,620
That's me!

2281
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:55,640
Ducky!

2282
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:56,860
Ducky Bird!

2283
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:59,700
She called me cute!

2284
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:02,680
I just put her together and she is everything.

2285
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:05,400
But I know you're probably dying to see her.

2286
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:07,140
So presentation time!

2287
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:07,740
Yay!

2288
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:19,350
Ducky Bird's rear!

2289
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:30,450
Oh you can barely tell which one is the real Ducky Bird!

2290
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:32,910
Which one is it guys?

2291
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:33,550
Can you tell?

2292
02:04:36,890 --> 02:04:38,170
Who will you shoot?

2293
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,590
The hair is so long!

2294
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:54,530
Oh my god!

2295
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:56,250
Shoot!

2296
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:57,670
Shoot the right one!

2297
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:01,310
Who's talking?

2298
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:02,230
You'll never know!

2299
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:05,550
It's so cute!

2300
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:07,170
I love how it came out.

2301
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:07,970
Oh my god!

2302
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:08,750
I love the hair!

2303
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:10,930
The hair is so well done.

2304
02:05:11,290 --> 02:05:12,990
With all the layers and everything.

2305
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:17,370
It's actually so cute!

2306
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:22,670
And here is my finished Ducky doll and I hope you love her as much as I do.

2307
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:26,290
I also hope her new owner will be super happy with this doll as well.

2308
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:26,870
The new owner?

2309
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:27,190
Me.

2310
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:35,970
I will be going on a tiny little break because I'm actually getting married Oh wait sorry I did not mean to fast forward that part where you get married.

2311
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:37,390
I'm so sorry that was an accident.

2312
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:40,450
Congratulations on the wedding!

2313
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:44,650
Congratulations to the wedding!

2314
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:46,430
Oh my god!

2315
02:05:47,790 --> 02:05:49,530
Yeah but I'm getting one of the dolls.

2316
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:53,630
And also like the person who won the auction is getting the other doll.

2317
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:55,350
That's so cute though!

2318
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:58,810
Oh my gosh huge shout out again to Moonlight Jewel.

2319
02:05:59,030 --> 02:06:00,090
I love their work.

2320
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:11,350
I remember watching their work before in the past so I was so surprised when she like contacted us saying that she wants to make a doll of me for the charity and like a huge shout out for them.

2321
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:35,690
It was like really nice of them to well they I paid them by the way so it's not like she did it for free because I feel like obviously all the artists need to be supported um and I was so happy that she offered to uh to offer her services for the charity auction and uh I'm so happy to receive one of the dolls!

2322
02:06:36,270 --> 02:06:38,270
I get to receive a doll keeper doll!

2323
02:06:38,850 --> 02:07:04,670
Alright guys let me show you guys okay the Jessica Rabbit outfit okay Jessica Rabbit uh fashion I was like oh my god I think this one making a Jessica Rabbit okay this oh my god yeah she has like a hundred and forty eight million views on this I feel like you guys must have seen this it's actually insane how talented her uh how talented she is in fashion here

2324
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:09,810
picking an hourglass body

2325
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,240
like what the fuck

2326
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,940
what the you can do that?

2327
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:29,480
you tell me baby baby please don't go away don't go away like oh my god

2328
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:58,890
how like what she went from an A to a D my ribs hurt my ribs hurt no the thing is she didn't even do so much D for DAB.

2329
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:00,430
Like, look!

2330
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:02,750
All she did was just pad it up!

2331
02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:03,650
It was just illusion!

2332
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:07,690
She got some foam and padded the fuck out of her thighs!

2333
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:11,870
And then she got, like, four fucking bras!

2334
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:18,970
Life is a lie.

2335
02:08:19,310 --> 02:08:20,570
It's all pads!

2336
02:08:21,630 --> 02:08:22,910
I love her stuff.

2337
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:24,550
She doesn't even have that many videos.

2338
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:27,690
But look at how many videos she has in general.

2339
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:33,030
But she already has three... almost three million views!

2340
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:37,370
Because of, like, how talented she is as a fashion designer.

2341
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:39,270
Like, oh my god.

2342
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:46,310
We're going for, like, an extreme look.

2343
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:47,370
Like, look!

2344
02:08:56,430 --> 02:08:58,710
Hello, my name is Shay, and I like to make things.

2345
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:02,530
And this week, I am telling you how I made my Jessica Rabbit costume and dress.

2346
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:06,750
Before I can even go for it, I'm vaguely following these two tutorials.

2347
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:08,750
But I'm just gonna kinda wing it.

2348
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:10,490
I should do this!

2349
02:09:11,490 --> 02:09:13,010
You're wrapping yourself in saran wrap.

2350
02:09:13,290 --> 02:09:15,850
Drawing on two little, like, chicken leg hip shapes.

2351
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:17,970
And cutting it all apart to get your pattern.

2352
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:19,790
It cut a hole in my shirt!

2353
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:21,190
This could be you guys, dragons!

2354
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:24,250
You can add this...

2355
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:25,210
For your butt!

2356
02:09:26,530 --> 02:09:28,730
You guys wanna, like, have more ass.

2357
02:09:29,070 --> 02:09:31,030
Add, like, these pads behind your butt.

2358
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:33,310
I think once I shave them down...

2359
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:34,930
It's actually gonna be really thick.

2360
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:36,390
I could be thick!

2361
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:38,070
You guys can be thick, too!

2362
02:09:38,490 --> 02:09:39,010
No!

2363
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:43,310
Just gonna kinda go for it.

2364
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:44,510
And cut off all the edges.

2365
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:46,270
Until it looks very nice.

2366
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:48,390
No more squats, guys!

2367
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:48,990
Look!

2368
02:09:49,130 --> 02:09:50,850
Holy shi- Look at that!

2369
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:52,570
No more squats!

2370
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:54,350
Just add pads!

2371
02:09:55,090 --> 02:09:57,450
But I think this is far too extreme.

2372
02:09:57,710 --> 02:09:59,550
Even for Jessica Rabbit.

2373
02:09:59,870 --> 02:10:01,170
So the hips looked good.

2374
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:02,910
But they were way too big for my body shape.

2375
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:04,310
So I'm doing take two.

2376
02:10:04,410 --> 02:10:06,010
This time with two inch foam.

2377
02:10:06,330 --> 02:10:07,910
Last time I used four hips.

2378
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:10,430
So this is what it looks like with the corset.

2379
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:11,830
I think it's a good shape.

2380
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,190
I think it's still very, like, hourglass.

2381
02:10:14,630 --> 02:10:16,870
Without being as crazy as it looks.

2382
02:10:17,950 --> 02:10:21,410
Holy shi- Okay.

2383
02:10:21,410 --> 02:10:21,650
Okay.

2384
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:23,630
Second one is definitely more natural.

2385
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:28,710
The second one is definitely a lot more natural.

2386
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:37,670
Version one is- Version one is Dexter's mom.

2387
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:40,390
This is literally Dexter's mom right there.

2388
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:46,050
This is- This is a Jessica Rabbit shape.

2389
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:49,490
Now all that's left to do is make the boobies.

2390
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:54,490
Stacking bras and stuffing them with socks is an A- Like an A-cup.

2391
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:55,530
Maybe a B-cup.

2392
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:59,170
But I have very little chest to work with in general.

2393
02:10:59,370 --> 02:11:02,670
So for building my chest, I really am trying to, like, push one of them out.

2394
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:06,150
And then build the rest out with padding.

2395
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:09,170
First up is just normal push-up bra that fits my size.

2396
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:10,730
This is from Victoria's Secret.

2397
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,850
As you can see, it's not a lot, but it's a little more.

2398
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:13,870
Make it a little bit more.

2399
02:11:14,070 --> 02:11:18,010
And then she adds- A second- Oh wait, she puts pads in there?

2400
02:11:19,230 --> 02:11:22,330
And then- And then bra number two.

2401
02:11:22,410 --> 02:11:24,090
How much does it accentuate?

2402
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:25,490
Oh my god!

2403
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:27,450
Is this how they do that?

2404
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:29,230
Holy shit!

2405
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:32,610
What do we want?

2406
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,630
Science.

2407
02:11:35,670 --> 02:11:36,250
Damn!

2408
02:11:39,330 --> 02:11:39,910
Magic!

2409
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:40,090
What's that?

2410
02:11:40,650 --> 02:11:41,450
What's put on the hips?

2411
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:42,430
Magic!

2412
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:45,590
I'm living a fantasy.

2413
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:46,910
Not really!

2414
02:11:47,670 --> 02:11:49,070
Again, that is all foam.

2415
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:51,090
All foam.

2416
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:52,930
The power of layers.

2417
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:56,630
Chat, is this real?

2418
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:59,610
Why don't you find out yourself?

2419
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:00,670
Buy four bras.

2420
02:12:03,230 --> 02:12:05,990
And go even beyond the super shade.

2421
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:06,590
Now we're going to have our face shades.

2422
02:12:06,590 --> 02:12:08,610
And move on to the next step, which is going to be patterning.

2423
02:12:08,610 --> 02:12:09,950
For that, I'm going to go outside.

2424
02:12:10,050 --> 02:12:12,030
She's like, 40% foam.

2425
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:13,750
Holy shit!

2426
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:15,230
All right, sponsored break.

2427
02:12:15,410 --> 02:12:17,710
Okay, I need to like- What the fuck?

2428
02:12:17,850 --> 02:12:20,650
Okay, I- I also added boning to this lining layer.

2429
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:22,770
The foam stays on.

2430
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:26,510
And with this chest, I'm going to build this structure and support.

2431
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:28,890
That's what we like, Jessica.

2432
02:12:29,250 --> 02:12:32,670
Not going to lie, this is a lot more boobage than I thought it would be.

2433
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:33,010
Oh my god!

2434
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:35,230
This is so crazy.

2435
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:36,230
It looks so nice.

2436
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:38,070
Bro, this is actually crazy.

2437
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:38,490
Is this okay?

2438
02:12:38,490 --> 02:12:38,590
Is this okay?

2439
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:41,850
It looks like it's falling out because that's kind of how her boobs are.

2440
02:12:41,970 --> 02:12:43,650
She went too far!

2441
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:46,710
I kind of love it.

2442
02:12:46,930 --> 02:12:48,170
I kind of love it.

2443
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:51,290
But now that we got the body, now that we got the dress- She kind of loves it, guys.

2444
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:55,530
Okay, and you're like- So this is the sequence- What the hell?

2445
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:56,150
Look at this.

2446
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:57,790
What the fuck?

2447
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,730
This is the same person.

2448
02:13:00,910 --> 02:13:04,290
The world- This is the same person.

2449
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:11,900
That's actually- This is actually crazy.

2450
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:14,340
She's so talented.

2451
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,520
She's actually good at wearing this costume.

2452
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:18,260
That's a free entr- Is this real?

2453
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:22,820
She looks amazing.

2454
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:23,920
Oh my god.

2455
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,300
This is the channel, by the way.

2456
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:26,720
She deserves it.

2457
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:27,300
I'm not subscribed.

2458
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:31,240
Guys, now I am.

2459
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,740
It's because she says she rarely uploads.

2460
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:37,300
This is the reason why!

2461
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:41,280
Like, whenever she does upload, I like- It just pops up.

2462
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,840
Oh, I'm subbing my recommended whenever she does uploads.

2463
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:48,180
Because it's so rare.

2464
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:51,460
Alright, wait, wait.

2465
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:52,380
Okay, Dollifle.

2466
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:53,400
Not Dollifle.

2467
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:54,280
Ah, Nerdforge.

2468
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:55,440
I love Nerdforge stuff.

2469
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:59,060
Nerdforge stuff is like... I love her builds.

2470
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,840
But like, I'll show you guys.

2471
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,220
I'll show you guys the...

2472
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:08,580
The... what is it?

2473
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:10,140
Which one is my favorite one?

2474
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,580
I think my favorite one has to be like her PC builds.

2475
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:18,000
Oh yeah, she turned her PS5 into a Dwarven Kingdom.

2476
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:18,720
Look at this.

2477
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:22,520
I'm Martina, and I have issues.

2478
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,440
I've been waiting for my PS5 to arrive, which it did after months.

2479
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:30,720
But now, all I can think about is how normal it looks.

2480
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:35,040
And I've been wanting to do things to it, but I keep telling myself, Martina, there's no need.

2481
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:36,680
I mean, it looks perfectly fine.

2482
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:38,180
Here, let's do that.

2483
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:40,340
Okay, so like, all she... she like, obviously...

2484
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:42,220
Foam is your best friend.

2485
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:47,100
But it's actually crazy that she turned it into some fucking Dwarven Kingdom.

2486
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:48,920
I love Nerdforge.

2487
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:50,360
I love the stuff she uploads.

2488
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,880
I'm not subscribed.

2489
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:52,380
Let me subscribe.

2490
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,280
I was subscribed!

2491
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:58,280
Okay?

2492
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,460
Just not... just not on this channel.

2493
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:02,800
Now I'm subscribed on this channel.

2494
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:11,020
I know it looks like I've done a lot here, but really all I've done is just cut some stairs.

2495
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:13,020
Bossa, thank you for tier 1 sub!

2496
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:13,860
Thank you, thank you!

2497
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:17,120
Way over here was foam, so it's not that bad.

2498
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,180
Nerdforge.

2499
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:24,320
Here.

2500
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:26,280
Nerdforge.

2501
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,720
Look at that.

2502
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:31,640
It's so cool.

2503
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:38,340
And now, let's fill all of these little gaps here with some Sculptamold.

2504
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:43,200
It makes so many things with, like, fucking foam.

2505
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:48,300
Like, I mean, like, cosplay for armor was originally done by, like, Nerdforge.

2506
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:51,660
Oh my god, there's this channel I really like that does, like...

2507
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:56,880
They do, like, D&D skits.

2508
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,600
I find it really funny.

2509
02:15:58,620 --> 02:15:59,600
I'm trying to remember the name.

2510
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:00,400
Does anyone remember...

2511
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:04,300
Does anyone, like, remember the channel name that does, like...

2512
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:06,560
Um...

2513
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,900
D&D re-uh... D&D skits?

2514
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:11,020
Trying to remember the name right now.

2515
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:18,620
All that work for a console that has no games.

2516
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:20,340
There's a lot.

2517
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:20,680
Yeah!

2518
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:21,360
Viva!

2519
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:21,760
Viva!

2520
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:22,940
La Dirt League!

2521
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:23,480
Yes!

2522
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:24,120
That one!

2523
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:24,680
Yes!

2524
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:26,800
That's one of my favorite channels, too.

2525
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:27,980
I love their skits.

2526
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:29,260
They're so fucking funny.

2527
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,740
He's going so fast, he's shaking.

2528
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:34,940
Poor William.

2529
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:36,160
Working so hard.

2530
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,180
All right, let me skip a little bit.

2531
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:40,480
Because I've seen this before.

2532
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:42,500
If you guys want to watch more, check out their channel.

2533
02:16:43,220 --> 02:16:46,280
But, like, oh my god, the painting, too.

2534
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:47,720
All mixed up now.

2535
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:48,740
Hopefully it's good enough.

2536
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,780
Like, wait, okay.

2537
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:51,180
I'm gonna start at the top here.

2538
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:52,980
I need to show you guys the finished product.

2539
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:56,740
This is, like, the electronics and stuff.

2540
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:59,200
Guys, skip, skip, skip.

2541
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:00,780
It's because I watched this already!

2542
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:07,040
If you want to watch, like, the full actual videos, check them out.

2543
02:17:08,140 --> 02:17:09,500
Give them a subscribe.

2544
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,800
Give them a view.

2545
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,240
Give NerdForge a view.

2546
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:12,980
They deserve it.

2547
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:14,460
Holy shit.

2548
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,370
Would it not overheat?

2549
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:19,860
Just don't play Cyberpunk.

2550
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:21,240
It's that easy.

2551
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,960
But we didn't watch it.

2552
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:24,400
Sad.

2553
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:30,400
Support the original video, nerds!

2554
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:31,200
Exactly.

2555
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:35,640
Not a true reaction!

2556
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:37,820
How dare you, Toki!

2557
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:40,020
Not leech off the entire video!

2558
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:43,700
Where's my real react, Andy?

2559
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,280
Pax, thank you for the raid!

2560
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:51,440
Thank you, thank you!

2561
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:51,440
Thank you!

2562
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:53,060
Hello everybody!

2563
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:54,800
My name is TokiBae!

2564
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:59,700
I usually stream on the YouTube, but today I'm apparently a failed React Andy.

2565
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:04,080
I'm a fake.

2566
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,500
Holy shit.

2567
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:17,020
I love like, she's so good at like crafting and painting and art and everything.

2568
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:18,440
She's so talented.

2569
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:21,760
Fake React Andy.

2570
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:29,000
How dare you not watch the entire video and steal all their content, Toki.

2571
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:29,860
What's the point?

2572
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:36,500
Are people this talented?

2573
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,580
It's because they're you.

2574
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:48,000
It's because they actually, they actually like get up from their PC.

2575
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:54,480
Let's try to turn this on and see what it looks like for the first time.

2576
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:55,940
And hopefully everything just works.

2577
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:56,820
Please.

2578
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:02,480
Does it not work like the Xbox?

2579
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:05,460
Like you can turn it on and- Does it not work like the Xbox?

2580
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:06,120
No!

2581
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,280
She's almost perfect!

2582
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:12,020
She- Stop.

2583
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:14,020
Okay.

2584
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:16,060
It worked!

2585
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:19,520
Thank you for gifting a tier 1 sub for both Cookie and Kat!

2586
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,140
Thank you!

2587
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:22,780
Dude, all the LEDs look so good!

2588
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:24,120
Ho ho ho ho ho!

2589
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:28,720
A fake gamer shake my head.

2590
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:34,040
A long serve.

2591
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:35,840
That is so good!

2592
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,120
Wait, I want close up.

2593
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:37,820
Give me the close up!

2594
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:39,400
Give me the close up!

2595
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:40,600
Oh my god, look at that!

2596
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,340
Holy shit!

2597
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:46,280
It looks so sick!

2598
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:49,380
It's like on your fucking desk.

2599
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:51,740
Like, holy shit!

2600
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:54,360
It could overheat!

2601
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:55,600
Just don't play Cyberpunk!

2602
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:57,660
Just play fucking Peppa Pig on this!

2603
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,840
Looks so good though.

2604
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:10,550
That's a fucking PS5, guys!

2605
02:20:15,910 --> 02:20:17,410
It's oozing lava!

2606
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:19,270
It's gonna overheat!

2607
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:25,320
I love her stuff.

2608
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:28,220
She's like actually one of my favorite crafting channels too.

2609
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:29,760
Okay, yeah, wait.

2610
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:31,980
I'm not gonna watch her stuff, but what was it?

2611
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:35,360
Viva La Dirt League.

2612
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:46,240
I mean, I have 6 million subscribers, but check out- if you like Dungeons & Dragons, I highly suggest checking out this channel.

2613
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:51,480
Because they do a lot of really funny- yes, you can tell that I watch every- every one of them.

2614
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:53,960
D&D stuff.

2615
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:58,940
I- I don't care about the- I don't care about these- the retail stuff.

2616
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:01,360
I just watch the Dungeons & Dragons ones.

2617
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,780
But, I suggest checking out their channel as well.

2618
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,380
I really like their stuff.

2619
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:10,000
Anyway, subscribe.

2620
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:10,880
Look!

2621
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,600
They always pop up in my recommended!

2622
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,720
That's why I never- I forget to subscribe!

2623
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:19,480
I always forget to subscribe!

2624
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:23,840
Because they always- whenever they upload new videos, it just pops up in my recommended!

2625
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:24,940
Chat!

2626
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:29,940
I swear!

2627
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:33,980
They just deliver it to me!

2628
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:34,380
Exactly!

2629
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:37,460
They like deliver- deliver the content to me!

2630
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:40,400
So I always forget to subscribe, because it's just there.

2631
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:41,920
It's just there.

2632
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:46,100
Uh, by the way, hit that subscribe button on YouTube, guys.

2633
02:21:46,180 --> 02:21:47,280
I'm not just there, guys.

2634
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:48,080
I'm not.

2635
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:49,460
Please subscribe to me as well.

2636
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:53,180
You see, that's how you subscribe to a person, you know?

2637
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:58,040
So you can also, you know, subscribe to someone like me on YouTube as well.

2638
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:01,420
I'm trying to like- there was another channel I really want to show you guys.

2639
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:06,340
But I'm trying to remember, uh, remember the name of it.

2640
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:06,780
Fuck!

2641
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:10,460
It was also a crafter channel, like similar to Nourish Forge.

2642
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:11,860
Um...

2643
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:14,160
I'm trying to remember it.

2644
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:16,320
It's like similar to Nourish Forge as well.

2645
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,640
Ah, I can't remember.

2646
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,780
I can't remember the channel.

2647
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:23,960
Let me look at my- let me look at how- how my recommended is like now.

2648
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:33,080
Let me see how- how fucked my recommended is like at the moment.

2649
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:39,900
It's not as bad.

2650
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:41,360
It's not that bad, actually.

2651
02:22:41,580 --> 02:22:42,400
Thank God.

2652
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,180
It's not that bad, chat.

2653
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:48,640
Let's see.

2654
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,360
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

2655
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:55,660
I mean, there's like other channels that I really like to watch.

2656
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,120
Uh...

2657
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,400
Uh...

2658
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:01,260
Oh, this one!

2659
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:04,180
Wait, is this the same one that made the...

2660
02:23:04,820 --> 02:23:05,300
Uh...

2661
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:08,000
They made the... the Pokemon...

2662
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:09,340
Uh...

2663
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:10,280
No, not this one.

2664
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:13,780
There was like a channel that does like Pokemon crafts that I really like.

2665
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:14,960
Let's see.

2666
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:17,340
Pokemon crafts.

2667
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:21,760
I want to see if I can find it.

2668
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:23,380
Oh!

2669
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:25,120
Is this one?

2670
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:28,820
Is it north of the- Oh, north of the border is really nice.

2671
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:29,880
I love north of the border.

2672
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:31,960
Oh my God.

2673
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,980
North of the border is more like, um...

2674
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:36,840
really fucked up dioramas.

2675
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:37,980
So...

2676
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:39,980
Um...

2677
02:23:39,980 --> 02:23:43,780
I'm scared of scrolling down because I saw what it was down.

2678
02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:44,940
But like, it's fine.

2679
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:45,780
It's for like more like...

2680
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:47,600
more like pretty...

2681
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:48,920
dioramas.

2682
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:50,320
Because, um...

2683
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:55,320
If I scroll...

2684
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:56,920
Oh!

2685
02:23:58,280 --> 02:23:58,920
Whoa!

2686
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:03,260
But I also enjoy their content as well.

2687
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:03,780
What is that?

2688
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:04,360
Yeah.

2689
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,760
Yeah.

2690
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:07,000
Oh yes, I remember!

2691
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:09,060
It's the one with the Halloween ones.

2692
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:10,300
Halloween...

2693
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:11,580
um...

2694
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:12,720
decoration...

2695
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:13,660
DIY.

2696
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:15,000
I think I...

2697
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:15,560
What's it...

2698
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:16,180
That channel?

2699
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:18,540
I'm trying to remember the channel's name.

2700
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:20,160
Was it Wicked Makers?

2701
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:21,240
Oh, I love this channel!

2702
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:23,360
This channel is really good.

2703
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:24,240
This one.

2704
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:28,060
They like, actually made like...

2705
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:28,800
um...

2706
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,220
They take like...

2707
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:32,400
Halloween decorations.

2708
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:34,860
And then like make them...

2709
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:35,380
Oh my God.

2710
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:36,160
This looks so good.

2711
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:37,940
They remake them into like...

2712
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:39,540
more like horror themed stuff.

2713
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:40,880
Which is really cool.

2714
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:42,920
They take like super cheap Halloween decorations.

2715
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:52,380
In this video, we are going to build a real catnap animatronic that actually breathes fog.

2716
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:55,220
Or Jamie and Jayne, we bring your favorite monsters to life.

2717
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:56,460
Like this 8 foot tall...

2718
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:58,020
Yeah, thank you for the free subscribe.

2719
02:24:58,180 --> 02:24:59,840
Tier 3 for 4 months!

2720
02:25:00,060 --> 02:25:00,840
Thank you, thank you.

2721
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:01,600
Yeah, those are real.

2722
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:03,120
It's not even like 3D.

2723
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:07,200
Catnap is the main boss in Poppy Playtime Chapter 3.

2724
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:09,100
And it's just... well, just look.

2725
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:09,840
Just look at it.

2726
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,500
Like, wait, let me show you guys.

2727
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:14,580
We're going to zoom in.

2728
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:17,500
If you guys want to actually check out the full video, let me subscribe.

2729
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:21,020
I swear!

2730
02:25:21,380 --> 02:25:23,460
They are my favorite channels!

2731
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,260
Guys, I swear to God, they're my favorite channels.

2732
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,940
I used to be subscribed.

2733
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:33,340
I used to be subscribed on a different channel.

2734
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,480
I swear!

2735
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,120
I hope that's enough space.

2736
02:25:43,460 --> 02:25:44,840
Oh, wait, did they make this themselves?

2737
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:46,240
They've done it.

2738
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:49,940
They've done... Oh, wait, they can make... they're starting to make their own animatronics.

2739
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:50,940
Holy fuck.

2740
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:52,480
That's actually crazy.

2741
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:55,600
They used to, like, just repurpose old animatronics for this.

2742
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:56,870
But, like...

2743
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:59,380
But I want to show you guys what's in it.

2744
02:25:59,380 --> 02:25:59,860
But, like...

2745
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:03,460
Wait, I'm trying to, like, show... Should we try it on?

2746
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:04,440
Holy shit.

2747
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,480
That shit's so creepy.

2748
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:06,420
I'm still worried that it's too heavy.

2749
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:08,760
Imagine having that, like, as a kid.

2750
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:09,700
Trick or treating.

2751
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:12,400
Imagine trick or treating as a kid and seeing this.

2752
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:18,840
Well, the box works, but the whole thing started to collapse.

2753
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:21,020
We fixed it.

2754
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:24,120
We had to spread the legs out more, and they need to be...

2755
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:24,880
You just want some candy.

2756
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:28,880
Because the pose is so dynamic, it doesn't balance otherwise, but it works.

2757
02:26:28,900 --> 02:26:30,480
And look, we can even push on it.

2758
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:32,880
You know what, though?

2759
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:33,780
I hate to say it.

2760
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:35,460
That box is expensive.

2761
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:37,420
That's not DIY.

2762
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:45,180
I took off a whole lot of material, and I don't even know if you can tell, but there's a lot...

2763
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,540
That weird cat's back.

2764
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:46,980
Ma!

2765
02:26:47,660 --> 02:26:50,160
...work on this for, like, three more days.

2766
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,280
And probably still not be happy with it.

2767
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:54,340
But at some point, you have to cull it.

2768
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:55,320
And it has to be done.

2769
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:56,900
Because we have to move on.

2770
02:26:57,980 --> 02:26:59,100
Oh my god.

2771
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:01,400
The wires coming out of the eyes.

2772
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:04,340
Okay, we're gonna... I'm gonna zoom past, guys.

2773
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:09,680
I know you guys really want to watch the DIY part, but guys, I want to see the finished piece.

2774
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:15,000
If you want to watch the full video, check it out!

2775
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,360
I'm being a fake React dandy.

2776
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:28,910
Holy shit.

2777
02:27:28,990 --> 02:27:31,550
I love how, like, they did the sans effect.

2778
02:27:31,770 --> 02:27:37,610
Where, like, if you carve the eye deep enough, you can make it so that eye will, like, follow you around.

2779
02:27:38,870 --> 02:27:40,850
Toki, please, find work.

2780
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:41,650
We have a free catnip moon.

2781
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:43,910
And this is what hangs off of his zipper pole.

2782
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:46,750
We could just paint it gold, like it is in the game.

2783
02:27:46,890 --> 02:27:50,290
But I've always wanted a reason to gold leaf something.

2784
02:27:50,610 --> 02:27:55,170
And it seems, like, super extravagant and ridiculous, but only the best for our boy.

2785
02:27:55,430 --> 02:27:57,170
I don't even know what gold leafing is.

2786
02:27:57,470 --> 02:27:59,550
Well, it's, like, super thin pieces of...

2787
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:00,790
No, you're supposed to eat that!

2788
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:05,270
Oh my god, she's wasting precious gold leaf food!

2789
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:06,910
How would the rich eat?

2790
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:09,430
They can't eat food without the gold leaf.

2791
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:09,830
And now it's gold.

2792
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:14,510
It's true!

2793
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:19,230
It's true!

2794
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:23,310
In order for rich people to eat, they eat the gold leaf on top.

2795
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:26,950
The rich will starve.

2796
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:32,510
Oh my god, they use, like, the pool noodles.

2797
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:34,330
That's so smart, the pool noodles.

2798
02:28:37,330 --> 02:28:38,690
Ugh, the rib cage.

2799
02:28:38,770 --> 02:28:41,470
It took me several hours, but I got all of the bad paint.

2800
02:28:41,650 --> 02:28:42,390
Off of the nails.

2801
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:43,950
And now I got this cool metallic paint.

2802
02:28:44,050 --> 02:28:44,510
We're gonna paint it.

2803
02:28:46,170 --> 02:28:48,630
In some ways, building Catnap has gone really well.

2804
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:54,090
We've learned so much since we started making animatronics that we were able to combine it all into this insanely awesome build.

2805
02:28:54,970 --> 02:28:58,290
But at the same time, this project has been the hardest thing we've ever done.

2806
02:28:58,470 --> 02:29:00,390
The longest hours, the most setbacks...

2807
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:02,350
For only $3,000 a day.

2808
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:04,230
You can starve a...

2809
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:07,370
You can save a starving rich man.

2810
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:08,570
That's how you get better.

2811
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:12,730
To animate Catnap's head, I'm using a huge servo.

2812
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:15,130
Because the head is really heavy, and we need a lot of torque.

2813
02:29:15,310 --> 02:29:16,710
A servo is different than a wiper motor.

2814
02:29:16,710 --> 02:29:17,310
What's a servo for?

2815
02:29:17,610 --> 02:29:18,970
Because I can tell it exactly how to move.

2816
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:23,930
To do that, I'm using this free software called Botango, which is used to animate animatronics.

2817
02:29:24,130 --> 02:29:26,470
Instead of writing code, I can just animate in a timeline.

2818
02:29:26,670 --> 02:29:27,390
It's super fun.

2819
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:29,950
Anytime I want, I can just make a new animation for Catnap.

2820
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:31,810
And then when it's ready, we export it to the Arduino.

2821
02:29:32,830 --> 02:29:34,510
Y'all, we just did a test run.

2822
02:29:34,590 --> 02:29:36,210
I can't wait for you to see him in action.

2823
02:29:36,450 --> 02:29:38,230
But before we do, we just want to say thanks for watching.

2824
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:38,930
God, I don't like that.

2825
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:41,770
This is... makes me uncomfortable.

2826
02:29:41,970 --> 02:29:44,330
Just sitting next to it as if, like, he's friend.

2827
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:48,990
That's so creepy.

2828
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:14,540
I won one for my six-year-old nephew.

2829
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:20,520
Oh, God.

2830
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:22,220
When it's, like, night time, too.

2831
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:24,540
It's so cool, though.

2832
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:33,500
They've done, like, they've actually repurposed, like, they've actually done, like, repurposing, like, Halloween decorations, too.

2833
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:34,540
Wait, let me show you guys.

2834
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:39,420
Like, the spider one.

2835
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:42,460
Like, they made that.

2836
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:43,840
And I'm gonna skip to the end.

2837
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:45,940
We've made a 12-foot spider.

2838
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,080
We've made a Minecraft spider.

2839
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:49,400
Like, they've repurposed it.

2840
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,220
They repurposed that and turned it into this, which is insane.

2841
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:53,720
It's actually crazy.

2842
02:30:54,040 --> 02:30:59,900
They, like, repurposed, like, old Halloween decorations to make, like, actual cool shit.

2843
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:06,220
But I wanna watch...

2844
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:07,440
Then watch the channel!

2845
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:09,300
Wicked Maker!

2846
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:13,140
I'm just showing you an example!

2847
02:31:14,580 --> 02:31:16,480
I've seen this video already!

2848
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:20,960
There's no reaction because I've seen it!

2849
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:24,740
I can actually do it!

2850
02:31:24,740 --> 02:31:26,900
Toki keeps skipping to the end.

2851
02:31:27,220 --> 02:31:28,400
Like, look at that.

2852
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:29,260
That's so cool.

2853
02:31:33,490 --> 02:31:35,350
I'm showing my favorite...

2854
02:31:35,350 --> 02:31:36,830
Guys, it's not...

2855
02:31:36,830 --> 02:31:38,290
You show me your favorite...

2856
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:40,510
It's me showing you my favorite channels.

2857
02:31:41,790 --> 02:31:44,390
Humanreactive streamer, you take that back!

2858
02:31:46,090 --> 02:31:48,450
It's like I'm showing you my mixtape.

2859
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:51,290
But instead, I'm showing you my favorite videos!

2860
02:31:51,730 --> 02:31:53,430
There's actually one where...

2861
02:31:53,430 --> 02:31:55,550
They made like Last of Us props too.

2862
02:31:56,350 --> 02:31:58,530
I'll show you the short because I can...

2863
02:32:00,590 --> 02:32:01,570
Oh my gosh.

2864
02:32:01,630 --> 02:32:03,330
Okay, the Last of Us one was really creepy.

2865
02:32:04,370 --> 02:32:06,710
I remember watching their Last of Us one.

2866
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:09,490
Liked videos.

2867
02:32:10,210 --> 02:32:10,610
Here.

2868
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:14,870
Let's turn this spirit Halloween animatronic into a clicker from The Last of Us.

2869
02:32:15,050 --> 02:32:18,090
A giant mushroom bloom has burst out of the clicker's skull.

2870
02:32:18,230 --> 02:32:21,850
So first, we're gonna cut a big ol' hole in his face where we want the mushroom to bloom out.

2871
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:25,370
To make the mushrooms, we'll cut a bunch of flowery looking shapes out of EVA foam.

2872
02:32:25,490 --> 02:32:31,230
We use a heat gun to bend and shape the pieces and then sculpt on top of them with foam clay to bulk them out and give them some texture.

2873
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:36,950
If you look at the clickers in the show, they're really colorful to contrast with the bleak environment.

2874
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:42,510
To match that look, we airbrushed on some really bright colors and then gave it a brown wash to make it look more organic.

2875
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:52,530
While I was painting, Jay tweaked the animatronic to give it a more scary... It's really cool because the one is the crafter and the other one's the engineer with the electronics, which is really cool that they're working together.

2876
02:32:52,650 --> 02:32:55,490
For this, we'll fill any gaps with foam clay and then add lots of details.

2877
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:59,530
I show you my mixtape, but skip until the end of the song.

2878
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:03,970
Finally, I just skipped to where the drop is.

2879
02:33:06,030 --> 02:33:07,890
Like, holy shit, that's so cool.

2880
02:33:09,670 --> 02:33:10,670
That's so cool.

2881
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:12,390
I just skipped to the drop.

2882
02:33:18,170 --> 02:33:21,650
Yeah, they made like, they've done like a lot of stuff, which is really cool.

2883
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:22,470
I love their channel.

2884
02:33:22,650 --> 02:34:03,790
as well uh because they do like a lot of like they repurpose like halloween stuff into like actual cool halloween decorations um i mean there's like a stuff okay like because like i don't want to go outside so instead of going outside and like i don't like roller coasters and like animatronics but i love watching like uh people filming attractions so like i don't know if you guys know like attractions 360 so like instead of like actually I just watch videos of other people showing what's in the ride,

2885
02:34:03,970 --> 02:34:05,810
so I don't have to go on the ride.

2886
02:34:11,290 --> 02:34:12,590
That's not sad!

2887
02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:15,870
I just don't like animatronics!

2888
02:34:16,690 --> 02:34:17,270
IRL!

2889
02:34:17,630 --> 02:34:20,170
Okay, like I said, I don't like animatronics.

2890
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:24,590
I don't like animatronics, but I love watching people make animatronics.

2891
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:28,030
Because I find it really interesting, but I don't like them IRL.

2892
02:34:28,250 --> 02:34:30,150
I think it's like, I'm always really scared.

2893
02:34:30,210 --> 02:34:31,570
I was like, ooh, what if it touches me?

2894
02:34:32,010 --> 02:34:34,770
It just scares the shit out of me.

2895
02:34:34,970 --> 02:34:40,250
So I like watching, experiencing it through video, because I'm not actually there.

2896
02:34:41,850 --> 02:34:44,050
Usually when I do ride, because I'll give you an example.

2897
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:48,930
I wrote that Harry Potter one from like, what was it?

2898
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:49,790
The...

2899
02:34:50,170 --> 02:34:50,710
Oh my god.

2900
02:34:50,970 --> 02:34:53,230
The fucking Dementors ride or whatever.

2901
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:57,170
And then like, I closed my eyes the entire time during Universal.

2902
02:34:57,710 --> 02:34:59,370
Like, you know the Universal rides?

2903
02:34:59,670 --> 02:35:04,630
I closed my eyes, and then I just don't experience it.

2904
02:35:04,750 --> 02:35:06,410
And then like, the Dementors ride.

2905
02:35:06,610 --> 02:35:10,130
And then I remember like, one of my friends was like, open your eyes!

2906
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:12,050
Oh my god, this is the cool part!

2907
02:35:12,230 --> 02:35:13,010
Open your eyes!

2908
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:13,950
And I was like, no.

2909
02:35:14,210 --> 02:35:17,410
And then I just rode the entire ride just closing my eyes.

2910
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:19,130
Like, I didn't even open my eyes.

2911
02:35:19,130 --> 02:35:22,710
So then I was like, I was like, oh shit, what was in there?

2912
02:35:22,850 --> 02:35:24,230
Like, you know?

2913
02:35:27,230 --> 02:35:29,230
It's not like I was super young or anything.

2914
02:35:29,390 --> 02:35:33,630
I think like, I was like, first year of university or something.

2915
02:35:33,890 --> 02:35:35,470
It was like, first year of university.

2916
02:35:37,170 --> 02:35:39,590
And it's like, and then they're like, open your eyes!

2917
02:35:39,650 --> 02:35:40,490
You gotta see this!

2918
02:35:40,490 --> 02:35:40,850
This shit!

2919
02:35:40,930 --> 02:35:41,810
Do I see this part?

2920
02:35:42,010 --> 02:35:44,390
And then I just closed my eyes throughout the ride.

2921
02:35:44,590 --> 02:35:47,470
So I never actually like, saw what anything happened.

2922
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:48,450
I felt it.

2923
02:35:48,450 --> 02:35:49,870
I felt like...

2924
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:55,350
I felt the ride.

2925
02:35:55,670 --> 02:35:57,030
Like, felt the wind.

2926
02:35:57,290 --> 02:35:57,930
And then...

2927
02:35:58,270 --> 02:36:00,290
But I didn't...

2928
02:36:00,290 --> 02:36:01,130
I don't know...

2929
02:36:02,190 --> 02:36:05,110
I don't know visually what it was.

2930
02:36:05,310 --> 02:36:08,650
So I just like, looked up on YouTube what the ride was like.

2931
02:36:08,810 --> 02:36:09,590
And I was like, oh hey!

2932
02:36:10,050 --> 02:36:13,010
Thank god I didn't open my eyes because that shit looks fucking scary.

2933
02:36:14,190 --> 02:36:15,870
Thank fucking god.

2934
02:36:18,450 --> 02:36:21,090
But I love like, watching videos of like...

2935
02:36:21,090 --> 02:36:23,130
Oh, did you guys see the new anim...

2936
02:36:23,130 --> 02:36:24,650
Okay guys, spoiler alert.

2937
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:25,150
If you guys...

2938
02:36:25,150 --> 02:36:27,850
The new like, Universal Jurassic Park ride...

2939
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:28,930
Looks so cool.

2940
02:36:29,310 --> 02:36:30,450
I would never ride on it.

2941
02:36:30,610 --> 02:36:31,090
But...

2942
02:36:37,110 --> 02:36:39,570
This one's like, in Beijing, right?

2943
02:36:39,810 --> 02:36:40,850
The Universal Studios.

2944
02:36:41,250 --> 02:36:43,290
I would never ride on it, but it looks so cool.

2945
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:45,890
The Jurassic Road.

2946
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:51,340
Yeah, it's in Beijing.

2947
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:54,760
It's so cool because it's apparently...

2948
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:00,760
It's apparently like, the dinosaur chases you too.

2949
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:03,920
I love looking at the...

2950
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:05,940
Also like, I like looking at the queue.

2951
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:06,940
The...

2952
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:08,040
What is it called?

2953
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:11,840
You know when you're in queue and they have like, all these like, decorations in queue?

2954
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:14,220
There's like, a special name for it.

2955
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:17,220
What is it called?

2956
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:18,740
Because like, sometimes I always...

2957
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:19,800
I do like, the lightning ride.

2958
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:20,800
The lightning ticket.

2959
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:22,400
So...

2960
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:23,760
You can skip...

2961
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:24,980
You can skip the line.

2962
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,320
So if you skip the line, you don't get to watch all the...

2963
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:29,220
The...

2964
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:31,120
The...

2965
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:31,820
The...

2966
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:33,820
The decorations from the queue system.

2967
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:36,300
So that's what I like to look at too.

2968
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:37,240
Because I get...

2969
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:41,300
And also you get to like, absorb it instead of like, being rushed in the queue.

2970
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:45,120
It's so cool.

2971
02:37:45,300 --> 02:37:45,880
The pre-show!

2972
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:46,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2973
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:47,660
Yeah.

2974
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:50,380
If you have the lightning ticket, you tend to skip all the pre-show.

2975
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:53,740
And then you also have to like, you know, you have to walk really fast during the pre-show.

2976
02:37:53,860 --> 02:37:56,080
Because you know, you want to get on the line.

2977
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:59,240
Oh my god, it's like we're there.

2978
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:02,060
Guys, it's like we're riding on the attraction right now.

2979
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:03,460
Oh my god.

2980
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:05,320
Yeah, you get to absorb the lore via video.

2981
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:06,800
It's like we're there!

2982
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:08,640
Holy shit, it's so immersive!

2983
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,960
Guys, it's like we're just like we're there!

2984
02:38:14,220 --> 02:38:15,800
Hands in the air, guys!

2985
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:17,540
Arms in the air!

2986
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:27,140
We're here right now!

2987
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:28,560
We're in Beijing!

2988
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:34,660
This is sad!

2989
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:35,840
What do you mean?

2990
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:50,040
It's so cool.

2991
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:52,460
When it starts chasing you, it's actually so freaky.

2992
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:58,080
So I think it starts...

2993
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:00,360
I would never ride this IRL.

2994
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:04,020
I would never ride this.

2995
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:19,520
It looks really cool though.

2996
02:39:19,700 --> 02:39:21,360
Like it looks so immersive.

2997
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:24,220
Really, it seems pretty cool.

2998
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:25,960
Yes, but like what if it touches me?

2999
02:39:27,380 --> 02:39:28,180
That's like...

3000
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:30,040
That's like my irrational fear.

3001
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:32,240
I'm like, what if it just touches me?

3002
02:39:45,500 --> 02:39:48,100
These dogs look so cool.

3003
02:39:57,210 --> 02:39:59,130
Look, it starts moving!

3004
02:39:59,810 --> 02:40:02,630
Holy shit, that's so fucking scary!

3005
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:05,950
It just starts chasing you!

3006
02:40:08,410 --> 02:40:09,290
Holy fuck!

3007
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:14,290
Oh, even the car moves.

3008
02:40:16,430 --> 02:40:18,450
Just like, do you think they don't chase you?

3009
02:40:18,490 --> 02:40:21,310
You know, like, I don't try because they don't move, but then it moves.

3010
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:42,800
Okay, then this is just like, I hate the...

3011
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:47,020
I'm not a huge fan of the screens.

3012
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:50,020
I wish they used less screens.

3013
02:40:50,020 --> 02:40:51,360
That's my only issue.

3014
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:55,000
I hate how amusement park rides use a lot of screens now.

3015
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:56,920
Oh my god, there's the T-Rex!

3016
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:02,380
I hate the IMAX sentence.

3017
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:06,080
In any amusement park ride.

3018
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,300
It just doesn't feel right.

3019
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:16,500
I thought they were going to kiss.

3020
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:18,820
Just like Godzilla and King Kong.

3021
02:41:24,350 --> 02:41:28,250
I love the whole debate of why is she running with high heels.

3022
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:36,100
Oh my god, there's Ted.

3023
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:47,820
I want to go to Universal Studios in Beijing.

3024
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:49,040
It looks so cool.

3025
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:52,800
You guys see the new Zootopia?

3026
02:41:53,860 --> 02:41:55,020
And in Disney.

3027
02:41:58,380 --> 02:42:01,300
Soon Disney will buy Universal.

3028
02:42:04,820 --> 02:42:06,860
He's just sleeping chat.

3029
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:11,980
So cool though.

3030
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:15,380
Let's see.

3031
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:18,100
There's a new Zootopia Land in Disneyland.

3032
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:19,640
In Shanghai.

3033
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:22,560
Uh...

3034
02:42:23,860 --> 02:42:24,920
I really like the animatronics.

3035
02:42:25,080 --> 02:42:35,560
To be fair, I think it's also because Universal and Disneyland in Shanghai and Beijing are newer builds.

3036
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:38,740
So they use newer animatronics and stuff.

3037
02:42:39,060 --> 02:42:42,620
And obviously, since it's a newer build, the technology is more high tech.

3038
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:47,820
And Disneyland and Universal in America are fucking old as hell.

3039
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:51,440
So it's super dated.

3040
02:42:54,220 --> 02:43:00,420
So like all the newer amusement parks have all the cutting edge technology.

3041
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:01,880
Like...

3042
02:43:03,460 --> 02:43:04,660
Even like the...

3043
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:05,560
Apparently...

3044
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:06,480
So like...

3045
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:08,580
Oh, doggy mug purchase.

3046
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:11,060
Jay, thank you for the 5,000 biddies.

3047
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:12,040
Thank you, thank you.

3048
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:13,120
Even like...

3049
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:13,460
Okay.

3050
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:14,060
So...

3051
02:43:14,060 --> 02:43:15,240
Is it like...

3052
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:18,660
America Disneyland has the Frozen ride, right?

3053
02:43:18,820 --> 02:43:20,960
So America Disneyland has the Frozen ride.

3054
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,020
And then...

3055
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:26,160
Hong Kong Disneyland has like the same Frozen ride.

3056
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:31,860
But the animatronics are better than like America's Disneyland.

3057
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:35,420
Because it's using the newer animatronics where it's not using the...

3058
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:36,980
What was it?

3059
02:43:37,020 --> 02:43:37,860
The 2D faces.

3060
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:41,180
Where like they use like the projected faces in America.

3061
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:43,040
Because that was the old animatronics.

3062
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:49,260
The newer animatronics actually uses like molded faces for like the Frozen...

3063
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:50,220
Let me see if I can find it.

3064
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:51,420
It's actually crazy.

3065
02:43:51,420 --> 02:43:58,060
Hong Kong Disneyland Frozen versus America.

3066
02:44:00,380 --> 02:44:01,300
Did anyone...

3067
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,240
Oh, there's...

3068
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:04,520
I want to know if anyone made like a comparison video.

3069
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:05,240
Oh, here you go.

3070
02:44:05,360 --> 02:44:06,100
Here you go.

3071
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:07,380
This is like...

3072
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:07,980
Well, Disney did it.

3073
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:09,340
Here you go.

3074
02:44:09,380 --> 02:44:10,380
You can tell the difference.

3075
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:11,300
It's actually crazy.

3076
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,280
Well, Disney did it.

3077
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:17,380
They gave the Elsa animatronic a new face.

3078
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:20,980
This is actually new footage Disney released for Frozen Ever After at Hong Kong.

3079
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:22,320
This is Hong Kong Disneyland animatronic.

3080
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:25,060
It's definitely a major upgrade from that projected face.

3081
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:25,780
Like look...

3082
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,960
This is America.

3083
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:34,160
This is Hong Kong.

3084
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:39,300
She came out of Star Trek.

3085
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,780
This is the animatronic, that's what I mean.

3086
02:44:42,460 --> 02:44:47,740
Because like Hong Kong Disneyland released a new Frozen and the comparison between the two.

3087
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:49,400
No fair.

3088
02:44:50,640 --> 02:45:01,240
I swear, I think like America Disneyland, America Disneyland, the Disney World is like the beta test and then after like beta test is over, they're like, all right, let's export this.

3089
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:07,780
It's so bad.

3090
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:10,880
Both figures are programmed with the exact same movements.

3091
02:45:10,940 --> 02:45:16,820
And if you look closely, the new animatronic's face matches the exact animation of the projected facial expressions.

3092
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:18,660
And it works even better in my opinion.

3093
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:19,620
Yeah, it does.

3094
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,460
This is perfect.

3095
02:45:20,900 --> 02:45:21,300
Is it real quick?

3096
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:25,700
Someone help me.

3097
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:27,860
Oh my god.

3098
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:38,220
But I feel like the Disneyland's and the Universal Studios outside of America are a lot better.

3099
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:42,700
Because the technology is better, I feel like.

3100
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:43,320
Because it's newer.

3101
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:46,060
The technology is like newer too.

3102
02:45:46,300 --> 02:45:47,400
Oh, and then like when...

3103
02:45:47,400 --> 02:45:48,500
Okay, it's so...

3104
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:49,000
It's so freaky.

3105
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:49,620
Okay, wait, wait.

3106
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:50,460
When like...

3107
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:52,000
Because they're using projected faces.

3108
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:55,560
And because they're using projected faces, it breaks down.

3109
02:45:55,860 --> 02:45:56,320
Okay, wait.

3110
02:45:56,620 --> 02:45:59,420
Elsa animatronic malfunction.

3111
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:02,500
And it's just a black screen.

3112
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:04,820
And it's so weird.

3113
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:06,200
It's so scary.

3114
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:09,620
It's actually really scary.

3115
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:11,400
Let me see if I can find it.

3116
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:15,360
Okay, let's see.

3117
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:16,900
Let's see if I can find it.

3118
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:18,100
It's actually so scary.

3119
02:46:22,430 --> 02:46:23,050
Wait.

3120
02:46:23,110 --> 02:46:23,250
Wait, wait.

3121
02:46:25,770 --> 02:46:26,930
Look at this.

3122
02:46:38,380 --> 02:46:41,180
Because the projected face breaks down.

3123
02:46:41,380 --> 02:46:42,880
And sometimes like the face...

3124
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:46,560
Oh, and then the Mickey Mouse ride uses these too.

3125
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:49,800
Mickey Mouse animatronic malfunction.

3126
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:51,600
Okay, malfunction.

3127
02:46:51,820 --> 02:46:53,520
Okay, I think it's this one, right?

3128
02:46:55,060 --> 02:46:55,680
Okay.

3129
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:57,620
I used to...

3130
02:46:57,620 --> 02:46:59,780
I watched some of the animatronic malfunction videos.

3131
02:47:00,020 --> 02:47:02,100
I love TPM.

3132
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:04,900
Okay, let's see if I can find it.

3133
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:06,660
Let's see.

3134
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:08,620
I think this is this one.

3135
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:09,940
Bear Frozen.

3136
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:13,860
Nope, not this one.

3137
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:14,540
Where is it?

3138
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:16,200
No, that's not...

3139
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:16,980
Oh my god.

3140
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:19,840
Where is the one with the Mickey Mouse breaking down?

3141
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:24,320
I love watching animatronic malfunctions from TPM.

3142
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:27,420
Top 10 Disney animatronic malfunctions.

3143
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:28,000
Is it this one?

3144
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:30,300
Where is it?

3145
02:47:31,160 --> 02:47:32,200
Six, five.

3146
02:47:32,460 --> 02:47:32,960
Nope.

3147
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:34,780
Not this one.

3148
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:35,580
Wait, is it this one?

3149
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:36,520
No.

3150
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:38,540
No.

3151
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:39,860
Where is it?

3152
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:40,380
TPM.

3153
02:47:40,860 --> 02:47:42,580
Don't you betray me right now.

3154
02:47:45,020 --> 02:47:46,120
Don't you dare.

3155
02:47:47,620 --> 02:47:49,200
Oh, it's this one.

3156
02:47:49,340 --> 02:47:49,680
Wait.

3157
02:47:49,820 --> 02:47:50,840
I think it's this one.

3158
02:47:51,360 --> 02:47:51,860
Okay.

3159
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,060
Let me find it.

3160
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:54,300
TPM.

3161
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:57,000
Let's see.

3162
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:00,740
Let me see if I can find it, guys.

3163
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:03,300
This is this one.

3164
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:03,840
Okay.

3165
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:04,920
Pirates.

3166
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:06,000
Figment.

3167
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:07,840
Million Dollar Bunny.

3168
02:48:08,380 --> 02:48:08,860
Carousel.

3169
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:09,360
Frozen.

3170
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:10,220
Ever After.

3171
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:12,100
Oh, it's this one.

3172
02:48:12,220 --> 02:48:12,480
Okay.

3173
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:13,020
Here it is.

3174
02:48:13,020 --> 02:48:13,320
Here it is.

3175
02:48:13,320 --> 02:48:14,740
This is the Frozen one I was talking about.

3176
02:48:16,300 --> 02:48:16,840
There it is.

3177
02:48:16,840 --> 02:48:17,280
There it is.

3178
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:19,680
There it is.

3179
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:20,160
There it is.

3180
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:20,520
There it is.

3181
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:21,840
There it is.

3182
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:23,360
There it is.

3183
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:24,800
There it is.

3184
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:32,960
The Glitching Projected Face looks exactly like the vertical lines you'd see on a damaged LED TV, only a little more unsettling.

3185
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:34,120
Silent Hill.

3186
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:43,000
Even with these face malfunctions, you'll get something more out of the lines of the character's face going completely black, like this clip of Elsa that was sent in by Vic Hanger on Twitter.

3187
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:43,120
Imagine being a kid if you see that.

3188
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:51,560
Oh, my God.

3189
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:52,920
Imagine being a kid.

3190
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:54,240
Oh, my God.

3191
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:56,700
She scared at least 10 kids.

3192
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:59,520
That shit's so fucking freaky.

3193
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:00,900
There's like a Disney version.

3194
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:02,920
There's like a Mickey Mouse of that, too.

3195
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:04,000
Oh, my God.

3196
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:05,380
All right, guys.

3197
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:06,740
I'm done showing you guys.

3198
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,380
I hope you guys enjoyed.

3199
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:22,380
I hope you guys enjoyed me showing you all some of my favorite channels and videos.

3200
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:23,520
It was like...

3201
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:26,320
It was definitely...

3202
02:49:27,560 --> 02:49:31,060
It was a lot of random videos, a lot of random channels.

3203
02:49:31,180 --> 02:49:32,720
This is what goes on in my mind.

3204
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:34,140
It's been three hours.

3205
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:34,720
I know.

3206
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:35,940
It's been really fun, though.

3207
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:36,480
I had a lot of fun.

3208
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:38,020
It's not going to be a super common thing.

3209
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:40,460
It's just a little like...

3210
02:49:40,460 --> 02:49:44,520
I guess like maybe like once every couple of months, I do something like this.

3211
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:47,580
Be a really bad React Andy.

3212
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:50,560
Sandy, give me five gifted subs.

3213
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:51,000
Thank you.

3214
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:51,480
Thank you.

3215
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,320
To be fair.

3216
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:55,680
It's because like a lot of these videos and channels I've seen...

3217
02:49:55,680 --> 02:49:59,700
This is literally like some of my favorite channels and videos.

3218
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,480
So like I've seen all these videos already.

3219
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:07,660
So it's like watching you dragoons react to it.

3220
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:14,500
You know how like people who like suggest like favorite moments, like favorite TV shows, and they watch your reaction to your favorite part in the show?

3221
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:16,360
That was me throughout this stream.

3222
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:17,900
I was like, oh, my God, this part.

3223
02:50:17,980 --> 02:50:20,440
I'm going to look at chat now, see how they react to it.

3224
02:50:20,620 --> 02:50:21,060
Like...

3225
02:50:25,580 --> 02:50:31,820
But it was really fun to see your reactions to some of my favorite videos and channels.

3226
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:35,080
Phoenix, thank you for the 100 bitties.

3227
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:35,500
Thank you.

3228
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:36,040
Thank you.

3229
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:37,300
Yeah, chat reacts to.

3230
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:39,460
It's not streamer reacts to.

3231
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:40,780
It's chat reacts to.

3232
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:44,520
You were the React Andy all along.

3233
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:50,440
Ben, thank you for the reset for three months.

3234
02:50:50,520 --> 02:50:50,820
Thank you.

3235
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:51,480
Thank you.

3236
02:50:51,500 --> 02:50:53,360
Yeah, I'm farming you guys for reactions chat.

3237
02:50:53,700 --> 02:50:55,580
But yes, I had a lot of fun.

3238
02:50:55,660 --> 02:51:00,200
I had so much fun showing you guys some of my favorite videos and channels.

3239
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:03,660
And I hope you guys had a lot of fun too, everybody.

3240
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:09,280
For those who are new here, my name is DokieBird and I usually stream on YouTube.

3241
02:51:09,560 --> 02:51:14,860
So please check me out on YouTube and subscribe to me over there and actually be a real fan.

3242
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:20,800
Not like me because I accidentally exposed myself as not subscribing.

3243
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:22,700
To some of my favorite channels.

3244
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:24,480
But you'll do better, right?

3245
02:51:24,740 --> 02:51:26,680
You guys will do better than me.

3246
02:51:27,100 --> 02:51:28,900
Thank you for a thousand bitties.

3247
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:29,340
Thank you.

3248
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:29,920
Thank you.

3249
02:51:29,940 --> 02:51:31,520
Thank you for the tier one sub.

3250
02:51:31,700 --> 02:51:31,980
Thank you.

3251
02:51:31,980 --> 02:51:32,480
Thank you.

3252
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:34,720
But I had so much fun though.

3253
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:39,220
Celeste, thank you for the five gifted subs.

3254
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:39,680
Thank you.

3255
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:40,380
Thank you.

3256
02:51:41,020 --> 02:51:45,180
But yes, if you guys want to follow me on Twitter, exclamation point Twitter.

3257
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:50,780
I usually tweet out when I'm doing Twitch streams because my Twitch streams are very, are like sort of random.

3258
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:55,520
But I let people know in advance on Twitter.

3259
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:57,000
So please follow me over there.

3260
02:51:57,220 --> 02:52:02,840
If you want to support me via other means, please check out my merch, exclamation point merch.

3261
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:05,660
And support me by buying merch as well.

3262
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:08,440
Anyway, guys, I had a great time with everybody.

3263
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:10,940
I'm going to head out now.

3264
02:52:11,240 --> 02:52:13,340
And as always, everyone stay hydrated.

3265
02:52:13,740 --> 02:52:14,320
Pause to check.

3266
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:16,480
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3267
02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:20,160
And if you stood up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3268
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:21,620
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3269
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:23,280
Bye, guys.

3270
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:24,720
Bye.
