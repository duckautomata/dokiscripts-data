1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,040
We're going straight in.

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,940
We're going straight in.

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,220
No intro because we got... I guess we listened to Jeff.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,660
Hello, everybody.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,060
We're going straight in.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,180
So we're going to listen to Jeff say whatever the fuck he wants to say.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,680
Hello, guys.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,260
I literally just got back from concert stuff, so I'm tired.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,940
But I'm here to watch some more Summer Game Fest trailer...

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,100
Some more game trailer release.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,460
Oh, God.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,840
I need to turn this volume down.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,740
He's way too fucking out.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,120
I can't stop listening to games sometimes.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,340
Sorry.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,900
I'm just... I'm tired.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,300
I know Jeff is a great guy.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,440
He's a great guy.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,840
I heard he's a great guy.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,260
I'm just...

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,980
Guys, look.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,340
I do not want to close any doors here.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,560
I don't want to close any...

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,000
Look, he's Kojima's best friend.

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Inzoy is a top selling...

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,300
Okay, to be fair, I feel like people only buy Inzoy...

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Just for the character customization...

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,600
And then they don't fucking...

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,560
Then they uninstall it.

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,820
And then they uninstall the game.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,280
It's literally just for the character customization...

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,080
And that's it.

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,300
I swear, I have not seen an actual gameplay...

35
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,040
From that game.

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,100
I feel like I have not seen real gameplay from it.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,980
You might get some nominations at the end of the year.

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,660
We're not there yet.

39
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,100
But it is a monumental achievement...

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,840
Earning the highest...

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Like, I don't even know what that game is about.

42
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,260
Like, other than the character customization.

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,120
Yeah, I was like, wait.

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,080
There's an actual gameplay in it?

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,460
So let me know...

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,260
How the sound is...

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,460
For Jeff...

48
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,620
It's just The Sims?

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,240
I've never seen any gameplay.

50
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,780
I swear to God.

51
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,300
I have not seen a single gameplay of this game.

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,740
He's very quiet.

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,980
All right, let me turn him up.

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,620
Isn't that a good thing?

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,980
Isn't that a good thing?

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,500
And that's precisely why events like Summer Game Fest, our partner showcases happening all weekend long, and initiatives like the Steam Next Fest are so essential.

57
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,980
These events help remarkable games, big and small, find their audiences.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,820
And hopefully, if you're watching this show, you'll discover your next favorite game.

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,400
All right.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,000
So, in that spirit, let's kick things off with a game from an independent studio who is thinking very big.

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,120
In 2017, four developers broke away from AAA publishers to chart their own course.

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,040
He's a part of a small indie studio, right?

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:10,380
And what you're about to see is a powerful testament to what passion, freedom, and a small, dedicated team can achieve.

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,740
Let's take a look at our first new game announcement.

65
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,580
Oh, the first game is always... the first and last game is always the best ones, right?

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,460
Bloodborne?

67
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,400
Guys, if they did not announce it on State of Play, we're not getting it here.

68
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,660
Whoa.

69
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,700
Performed by Behemoth.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Whoa, wait.

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,180
Spiritual successor to Bloodborne?

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,060
What is this?

73
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,060
Mortal Shell?

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,160
What's Mortal Shell?

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,020
Is this heavy metal Bloodborne?

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,320
Bloodborne?

77
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm a what?

78
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm a what?

79
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,060
A weapon?

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,060
A wizard?

81
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,800
This looks like fucking hardcore bloody...

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,740
This looks like...

83
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,880
Bloodborne rated R.

84
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,800
Yeah, edgy.

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,540
American Bloodborne.

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,560
You know what the...

87
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,120
This looks...

88
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,180
Wait.

89
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,220
Okay, I need to know.

90
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,060
Was this by an American studio?

91
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,340
This looks like...

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay.

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,620
So you tell that Bloodborne is from a Japanese studio, right?

94
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,060
So like...

95
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,100
It feels like Bloodborne...

96
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,420
But what if it was created by an American studio?

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
There's something about it...

98
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,120
That just tells me that this was done in America.

99
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,580
I don't know.

100
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,580
This one...

101
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,260
There's a feeling.

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,580
It's like...

103
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't know.

104
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,620
I think it's the edginess.

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,780
It...

106
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,440
Like...

107
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,740
It just feels...

108
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,920
More bloody.

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,880
Because like...

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
You guys know that like...

111
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,760
A lot of Japanese...

112
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
Studio games...

113
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,520
Oh, Mortal Shell.

114
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,680
Is Mortal Shell actually from an American studio?

115
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,140
Or was I wrong?

116
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,000
I never heard of Mortal Shell before.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,520
Apparently it's Mortal Shell 2.

118
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,280
So there was...

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,780
It's a sequel.

120
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,560
But is it an American...

121
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,260
Oh, it's German.

122
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,720
Okay.

123
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,960
I was gonna think...

124
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,460
It's either...

125
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,800
It's either American or German.

126
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,360
I could tell...

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
It's either American or German.

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,580
Because it's that feeling.

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,280
That makes a lot more sense.

130
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,600
Yeah.

131
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,020
Okay.

132
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,060
So I was gonna say...

133
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,300
This is the reason why.

134
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,180
It's because like...

135
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,700
You guys didn't know?

136
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,760
A lot of like...

137
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,840
Games that were developed by...

138
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,940
Japanese studios...

139
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,500
Actually get heavily censored...

140
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
In...

141
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,980
Um...

142
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,820
Here's the first...

143
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,300
Oh, am I low?

144
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,260
Um...

145
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,880
It gets...

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
Really censored...

147
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,500
In Japanese releases.

148
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,500
So like...

149
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,320
Resident Evil is actually really...

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,780
Like...

151
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,140
In terms of goriness...

152
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,820
And blood...

153
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,020
It's actually...

154
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,540
Really censored...

155
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,160
In the Japanese release...

156
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,600
Uh...

157
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,300
For the game.

158
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,960
What the fuck?

159
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,600
Is this Fortnite?

160
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Fortnite?

161
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,140
Did you see that goo guy?

162
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,260
The...

163
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,620
The...

164
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,240
The...

165
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,220
Is this Fortnite?

166
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,700
This...

167
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,480
Yeah, it was...

168
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,640
I saw the purple goo guy.

169
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,260
I was like...

170
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,040
Wait a minute.

171
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,840
Who the fuck is that guy?

172
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,860
I think I saw a Jonesy.

173
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,380
All right.

174
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,140
Right now, it is an honor to welcome...

175
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,920
To Summer Game Festival...

176
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,020
I didn't hear him say Fortnite.

177
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,140
I was too busy explaining about Resident Evil.

178
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
...project in just a few short weeks.

179
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,700
With each of his games...

180
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,640
He pushes the gaming medium...

181
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,420
In bold new directions...

182
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,580
And we are honored...

183
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,400
To have him with us...

184
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,220
For the first time...

185
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,260
I'm glad you're showing up...

186
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,060
This small indie game.

187
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,740
I know, right?

188
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,040
I can't believe...

189
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,820
The small indie studio...

190
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,000
From Epic...

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,020
Oh my god!

192
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,820
Kojumbo!

193
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,380
Is he gonna show...

194
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,800
Pokora?

195
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,440
His...

196
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,460
His Oshi?

197
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,040
Oh my god.

198
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,580
I...

199
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,500
Honestly, it'd be...

200
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,760
Pure cinema...

201
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,960
If he like...

202
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Talks about like...

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,720
The VTuber addition to his game...

204
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,960
Journey Summer Game Fest.

205
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,300
It's great to have you here.

206
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,020
We are so excited for DS2.

207
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,280
So, let me ask you, Mr. Kojima...

208
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,440
You've worked for many years on this project...

209
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,940
He has to show his Oshi 2 that work.

210
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,180
What do you hope players take away...

211
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,720
From DS2 when they play it later this month?

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
Well, we hit the pandemic...

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,340
After we released DS1.

214
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,240
Everyone experienced the pandemic.

215
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,420
So, I wanted to show something new...

216
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,000
Connection...

217
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,800
After we face the pandemic.

218
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,980
So, I want everyone of you to think about that...

219
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,640
When you play this game.

220
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,440
How's the volume for the...

221
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,480
That's coming out later this month.

222
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,440
But right now, I know you've prepared a special...

223
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,100
The watch-a-lan.

224
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,400
Like, what they're talking about.

225
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,700
Is it okay, sound guy?

226
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,400
Let's take a look at this.

227
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,380
I don't know if sound...

228
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,580
If sound guy's already said anything.

229
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
It's a little low.

230
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,160
Alright, what is sound guy saying?

231
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,860
I could...

232
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,260
Oh, do a little bit more.

233
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,920
Alright, this is...

234
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,060
I'll update a little bit more.

235
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,960
Volume is good here.

236
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,660
Okay, sound guy.

237
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,660
I'll update a little bit more.

238
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,940
So, let me know if...

239
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,060
I should lower it then.

240
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
Actually, I could just...

241
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,700
Oops.

242
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,600
Welcome.

243
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,700
Hello.

244
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,980
What, is this Death Stranding?

245
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,940
What's this?

246
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,800
Yeah, where's Pecora?

247
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,780
Oh, it's because usually my mods talk in Discord.

248
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
But, like, since I have only one monitor...

249
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,040
I just wanted to talk in the chat.

250
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,920
Because I...

251
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,680
I...

252
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,860
I don't...

253
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,340
It's too much of a hassle.

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
So, you are near Vanna.

255
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,460
Mm-hmm.

256
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,180
Where the fuck is my VTuber?

257
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,020
What do you do?

258
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,540
Ha ha ha ha ha.

259
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,120
Is Pecora really his Oshie if he's not gonna show her to the entire...

260
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,260
In the Summer Game Fest?

261
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm a porter.

262
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,140
You think Jeff's gonna do anything about it?

263
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,120
Ha ha ha.

264
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,080
Jeff's gonna do nothing.

265
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,460
Ha ha ha.

266
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Come on, Kojumbo.

267
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,560
You know you want to.

268
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:18,780
So, thank you.

269
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,480
We're good for the day.

270
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,940
You know you want to.

271
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,400
Ha ha ha ha.

272
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,400
What is it?

273
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,510
So, you made it then.

274
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,890
Sorry.

275
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,410
Who's...

276
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,750
Which famous actor is he?

277
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,410
You really don't remember me.

278
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,100
Whoa.

279
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,720
Oh!

280
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
Workplace harassment.

281
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,400
Stop!

282
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,200
Stop!

283
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,300
Stop!

284
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,420
Stop!

285
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm calling HR.

286
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,020
Yeah, that is very unprofessional.

287
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,520
Ha ha ha ha ha!

288
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,900
Neil and Lucy.

289
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
Well, that was a...

290
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,700
Luca Marinelli.

291
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,680
We saw our first clips of Neil and Lucy.

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,400
And we met them in the trailer back at South by Southwest.

293
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,920
But we got a little bit more of them here.

294
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,280
Tell us a little bit more about this clip.

295
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,100
Is he a famous actor?

296
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,140
In DS2.

297
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,020
It's a very important character.

298
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,300
I just realized Conan O'Brien was in Death Stranding 1.

299
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,920
I can't really say because there'll be spoilers.

300
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,280
So, I want to know, like, what other cameos is he going to have?

301
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,300
What other, like, American actors are going to be in this one?

302
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,140
Or famous actors?

303
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,720
Yeah, there's a lot of cameos in Death Stranding 2 Picoras.

304
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
And of course, by story...

305
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,300
Could Jumbo just add all Pecora?

306
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,360
JK is just all Pecora.

307
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,020
But this time, Neil will be like...

308
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh my god, too!

309
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,580
Ha ha ha ha!

310
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,480
Uh, for DS2 this time.

311
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,560
And Cliff was a very popular character.

312
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,540
But I think...

313
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,420
We have to kind of, like, top that character.

314
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,840
So Luca Marinelli was a great actor, and I think...

315
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,140
Wait, what does Luca Marinelli do?

316
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,940
So I think you'll like this new character, Neil, too.

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, he loves Hollywood.

318
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,740
The game's going to be out in 20 days, so I'm not going to give any spoilers.

319
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,940
Wait, in 20 days?

320
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,620
It's that soon?

321
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,100
But there is more to share, and...

322
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,160
Oh, he does Italian films?

323
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,920
...to learn more about the game, actually.

324
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,440
This Sunday, as part of Summer Game Fest, would you tune in to the DS2 live game premiere, where Hideo will be joined by many members of the cast.

325
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,920
He'll be sharing a new demo of the game, live gameplay demo.

326
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,980
That's actually really...

327
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,780
Yeah, I didn't realize it's that soon.

328
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,420
I feel like I have not seen enough gameplay.

329
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,000
This is not the last that you've seen of Neil this weekend.

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait, wait, it's coming at...

331
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,160
I feel like I did not see much gameplay of this game, other than cameos.

332
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,240
If you enjoy, we'll join us Sunday, too.

333
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:27,980
Excellent.

334
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,500
All right, thank you so much.

335
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,640
Hideo Kojima, everyone.

336
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,800
Great to see you, Mr. Kojima.

337
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,440
Thank you.

338
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,340
The gameplay at Death Stranding.

339
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,120
All right.

340
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,740
That's Kojumbo for you.

341
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,200
Now, my co-host for Summer Game Fest.

342
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,440
She's along for the party.

343
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,020
A veteran games journalist on GameSpot and the co-host of the Friends Per Second podcast.

344
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,200
Please join me in welcoming the incredible Lucy James.

345
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm so confused.

346
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,120
I'm so confused.

347
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,260
I didn't realize it's that soon, because I feel like I've seen nothing substantial in terms of gameplay.

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,280
Thanks, Jeff.

349
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,140
And hello, Summer Game Fest.

350
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,940
I am so excited to be here this year.

351
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,520
Thank you for having me.

352
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Now, we are honored to reveal an exciting new project from Raw Power Games, a new team headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.

353
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:25,240
Here, you can engage in intense combat, fight for land, glory, and legacy, and lead massive armies into epic-scale battles as narrated by actor Tom Hardy.

354
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,420
Tom Hardy?

355
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,100
Venom?

356
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,340
What?

357
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,820
Venom?

358
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,720
What do you mean, Tom Hardy?

359
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,420
Mad Max?

360
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,200
How many inches of Venom is in this game?

361
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:18,000
You know, like, Venom isn't even voice acted by Tom Hardy anymore, because, like, it's, like, too much for his voice.

362
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,900
He doesn't even actually voice act Venom.

363
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,900
No.

364
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,500
It's done by someone else.

365
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,660
I forgot his name.

366
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,040
Um.

367
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,980
I forgot his name, though.

368
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,220
Yeah, it's very straining to them.

369
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,280
He's, like, Hey, yeah!

370
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,300
Like, Like, that voice is fucking hurts your throat.

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
Go write your own.

372
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,070
What game is this?

373
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:57,770
Is this...

374
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,030
What?

375
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,450
Chronicles Medieval.

376
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,070
Oh, it's a game I'm not gonna play.

377
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,870
I'm sorry.

378
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,090
Like, it's...

379
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,330
It looks like an RPG game.

380
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,170
Yeah, I was gonna say, it looks like Kingdom Come.

381
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,430
It's time to hang on to the edge of tomorrow.

382
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,810
Sonic Racing Cross Worlds is a thrilling new entry in the legacy of racing action games with a Sonic franchise.

383
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,210
And I got it for like, Yeah!

384
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,030
Sonic Racing!

385
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:33,850
Brings other worlds and familiar faces to Sonic Racing, including surprise guest characters being revealed here at SGF.

386
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,030
Let's fucking go!

387
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,310
Finally a real game!

388
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,770
Let's go!

389
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,690
I like how people are cheering for it.

390
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,630
They're like, Yeah!

391
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,390
Sonic Racing!

392
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,630
We're so excited.

393
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,390
Oh,

394
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:06,970
shit.

395
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,270
Wait, that's not a car.

396
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,650
Who let this guy...

397
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:09,990
What the...

398
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,570
That's a...

399
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,430
Wait, that...

400
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,090
Oh, that's a famous Sonic game.

401
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,470
Wait, uh...

402
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,670
Hatsune Miku?

403
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,870
Hatsune...

404
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,510
What the fuck?

405
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,710
That's...

406
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,210
That's a...

407
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,670
Itchy pie!

408
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,710
Wait, what the...

409
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,870
What the fuck?

410
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,310
Oh my god!

411
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,970
Persona!

412
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:34,910
Let's go!

413
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,030
Finally a real racing...

414
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,170
What are these...

415
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,230
Okay, I...

416
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,810
What?

417
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,150
What are these cross-overs?

418
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,910
What is this game?

419
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,330
Oh my god.

420
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,730
Oh.

421
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,250
Death on arrival Mario Kart.

422
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,270
That's right.

423
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,990
A real competitor this year.

424
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,510
The game is safe.

425
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,710
Now.

426
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,750
Oh my god.

427
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:13,490
Look, it even has... I like how Sonic Racing Cross Worlds even has the word worlds in there.

428
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,410
They're like, yeah, Nintendo.

429
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,690
That's right.

430
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,410
That's right, Nintendo.

431
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,150
We have Hatsune Miku.

432
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,730
What do you have?

433
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,430
That's right.

434
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,030
You think your moo moo cow can beat Hatsune Miku?

435
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,790
You have cows.

436
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,350
We have Miku.

437
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,710
So you can race against all of your friends across all of the platform.

438
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,890
Wait, they never had multiplayer before?

439
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,970
Why are they saying that as if it's like the most mind-blowing thing ever?

440
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,010
Dude, what?

441
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,790
They didn't have crash platform multiplayer before?

442
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,270
Oh my

443
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:11,830
god.

444
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,750
Gaming is...

445
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,780
No way.

446
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,940
That's all I want.

447
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,440
That's all I want.

448
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:24,500
That's all I want.

449
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,400
Okay.

450
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,260
That got Miku.

451
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,380
Game of the... Pierce it up.

452
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,360
And I have everything.

453
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,180
Across a dark fantasy world.

454
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,620
Okay.

455
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,560
Not gonna lie.

456
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,660
And I'm kind of a vast story that it causes time.

457
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,840
Nintendo's Super Mario Kart.

458
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,220
I'm sorry, buddy.

459
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,660
But do you have Steve and Miku in your racing game?

460
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Bro, that guy was doing tricks on his mine cart.

461
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,540
Bloodborne?

462
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,100
That's... That was actually crazy.

463
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,940
I was not... I... I thought that... The twist just kept coming and coming and coming.

464
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,840
The fuck?

465
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,600
What's this?

466
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,440
Is this... Devil May... Devil May Cry?

467
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:16,960
This?

468
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,800
No way.

469
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,880
There's no way that's Devil May Cry.

470
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
I was gonna say...

471
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
He is not edgy enough.

472
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,280
I know.

473
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,460
So it was like Devil May Cry.

474
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,900
I was like, no fucking way.

475
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,840
He does not look edgy enough for Devil May Cry.

476
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,910
Oh, this is before...

477
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,790
Oh, I rewind.

478
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,230
This is before she turned into whatever the fuck the candle lady was.

479
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,790
Oh, I need to undo the sins of ruin.

480
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,300
In this time...

481
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,620
Or maybe the next...

482
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,440
You'll find...

483
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,540
How to save us all.

484
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,730
Oh!

485
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,930
Alright.

486
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,690
Is this JRPG?

487
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,230
Or is this action JRPG?

488
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,010
Or is this Souls?

489
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,710
Souls.

490
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,590
Is it Souls?

491
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,030
I feel like everything's Souls now.

492
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,500
I feel like that's, like, the next genre.

493
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:48,040
For shooters, it's Extraction Shooter, and now, now for, like, any other game, it's Souls-like.

494
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,240
Oh, it's Code Vein 2!

495
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,100
Never heard of Code Vein 1 before.

496
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,960
I never heard of that game before.

497
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,040
Epic Games?

498
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,460
Fortnite?

499
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,680
I have?

500
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,600
I've played Code Vein before?

501
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,100
I...

502
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,040
When have I...

503
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,540
I don't remember playing Code Vein before.

504
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,370
I have?

505
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,230
I don't remember playing Code Vein.

506
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,330
Oh, my God.

507
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,490
I actually don't remember.

508
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,030
I have?

509
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,370
I have?

510
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,990
Oh, it was a sponsor!

511
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,990
Oh, I don't remember!

512
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,390
I don't remember!

513
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,470
I don't...

514
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,240
That was a very moody, cool new game.

515
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:27,600
That was End of Abyss, the debut title from Malmo, Sweden-based Section 9 Interactive, an atmospheric action-adventure game coming in 2026 to the Epic Games store and consoles.

516
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,060
Next, we'll step into the black-and-white world of rubber-hose animation...

517
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,800
People buy Epic Games...

518
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,820
People buy games on Epic Games that's not Fortnite?

519
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,980
Wait, what did it say?

520
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,060
...releasing later this year.

521
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,720
Here's a quick new look at the game and the reveal of a familiar voice.

522
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,540
Oh, it's the mouse one!

523
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,860
I want to play this one!

524
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,240
This game looks so cool!

525
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,740
Oh my god!

526
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,960
This game looks so fucking cool!

527
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,780
I love the art style.

528
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Rats!

529
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah, I like the...

530
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,540
I like the style of this.

531
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,380
Troy Baker, of course.

532
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,660
Of course.

533
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,300
Troy...

534
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:21,000
It's gonna be like 40 years later and then Troy Baker will still be voicing a 20-year-old protagonist.

535
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,460
Alright, that's not all from Playside.

536
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,040
Now comes the announcement of another ambitious project from an independent Australian developer.

537
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,400
He'll be like 70 years old and he'll still be like voice acting the main character of whatever 20-year-old it is.

538
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,760
Like...

539
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,360
But this takes things to a whole new level.

540
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,660
It's a premium real-time strategy game built for PC based on one of the most iconic fantasy franchises in the world.

541
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,800
Any guesses?

542
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,400
What?

543
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,980
Let's take a look.

544
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,800
At this day and age, a real-time strategy...

545
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,520
Lord of the Rings?

546
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,560
Wait, is this...

547
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,540
Game of Thrones?

548
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,340
Is that...

549
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,920
Oh, it's Game of Thrones RTS.

550
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,920
You may think you know how the game is played.

551
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,200
An actual real-time strategy game in 2025.

552
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,280
Like...

553
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,620
I admire their bravery for the market they're trying to get into.

554
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,440
No, it's Game of Thrones and RTS.

555
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,600
Isn't the final season basically killed off Game of Thrones?

556
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,680
I heard the dragon one was a good show though.

557
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,480
You decide...

558
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,520
Like, I read that some...

559
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,820
One of the actors read the script and it was so fucking bad.

560
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,560
They were like walking around in London in midnight to contemplate their lives.

561
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,720
Their life or something.

562
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,120
Cause it was that bad.

563
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,020
They were like walking around and like in midnight.

564
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:25,900
Just trying to be like, I can't believe this is the script we got.

565
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,000
Wait, what?

566
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
So you kill one of them?

567
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,380
They go on...

568
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,480
They're now on your side?

569
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,760
What?

570
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,780
Is this Battle Mill Earth's successor?

571
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,020
Where...

572
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,980
Where was the gameplay trailer?

573
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,120
Like...

574
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,800
Yeah, the CGI looked so cool.

575
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,320
But we all know what RTS actually looks like.

576
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,300
Like...

577
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,740
Like...

578
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,240
Like...

579
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,360
Like...

580
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,340
Yeah, the CGI was so fucking cool.

581
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,680
But we all know what...

582
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,220
The...

583
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,720
The top down...

584
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,180
Outlook?

585
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,160
The great Tsiolkovsky on set.

586
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,860
One could count a million...

587
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,100
I don't understand.

588
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,640
RTS is...

589
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,800
We all know what RTS looks like.

590
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,540
It is said, if they were out there, they would have visited Earth.

591
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,120
What's this?

592
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,420
What game is this?

593
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,060
It's an FPS game.

594
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,900
Oh.

595
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,420
My answer is...

596
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,980
Maybe...

597
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
They will visit us.

598
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,440
But time has not come yet...

599
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,260
For this.

600
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,960
You know what that game reminds me of?

601
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,100
That robot game.

602
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,600
With the hot robot twins.

603
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,020
Oh, it is!

604
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,720
It is!

605
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,700
It is!

606
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,020
It...

607
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,760
Yeah, I was gonna say...

608
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,480
Is this Atomic Heart?

609
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, I was gonna say...

610
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,220
This has to be Atomic Heart.

611
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,500
With the hot robot twins.

612
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,740
And I was like...

613
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,620
There she is!

614
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,970
Oh my god!

615
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,910
Is that a dinosaur?

616
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,080
Oh my god!

617
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,680
The robot dinosaur!

618
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,700
On a good time...

619
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,740
Don't stop me!

620
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,500
Oh nice!

621
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,900
Have a good time, Captain.

622
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,280
There's new robot twins?!

623
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,860
Oh my god, they're gold.

624
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,460
You know they're- OH MY!

625
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,640
Don't stop it, don't stop it.

626
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,980
Okay- OH!

627
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,200
Wow, okay.

628
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,520
They know- they know what the people want, that's for sure.

629
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,220
They- they- they know what they're doing.

630
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,520
Oh yeah, speaking of Borderlands 2, that's crazy what they did.

631
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,260
Before the release of the new Borderlands 2.

632
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,200
What did they do?

633
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,500
Okay, so you know how Borderlands 2 was free?

634
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,160
Apparently people found out that there's spyware installed in Borderlands 2.

635
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,080
That's why they made it free.

636
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,860
But these are all, like, allegations, so people don't know if it's true or not.

637
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:09,320
Like, the devs haven't made any- they didn't make any, um, official statement about it.

638
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,600
But people were saying that they- they added something new that wasn't in the old Borderlands 2.

639
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,160
When it showed up, I was in the lab.

640
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,800
I didn't even see it.

641
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,760
You know?

642
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,320
I felt that same fear, though.

643
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,760
But it's like- it's all allegations, though.

644
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,680
I held a sense of my own powerlessness.

645
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,070
How did the whole of humanity miss it?

646
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,150
And did we actually- What's this?

647
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,730
Oh, that's like more information.

648
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,600
But yeah, if you look at Borderlands 2 right now on Steam, it's getting heavily review-bombed.

649
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,960
Because of it.

650
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,340
That- this is Atomic Heart 2.

651
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,340
I like how they're like- how do we improve on the- the hot robot twins?

652
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,640
We make them gold.

653
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,320
Like, that's how you improve it.

654
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,540
Real and true.

655
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,220
The Cube.

656
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,420
Oh wait, it's another one?

657
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:34,940
MMO.

658
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,520
They were right.

659
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,340
Cold is kinda hot though.

660
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,760
It's like... Oh, I actually don't know what this game is about, but everyone was talking about it.

661
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,460
Oh, it's a beat-em-up.

662
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,380
Oh.

663
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120
It's the arcade beat-em-ups.

664
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,000
I mean, it reminded me of it.

665
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,720
The art style.

666
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,880
The art style looks like an arcade beat-em-up.

667
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
Like the classic ones.

668
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:19,720
I was gonna say, it's like, you know, you're buying an iPhone and you're like, do you want the silver, the platinum, or the gold iPhone?

669
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,160
This is only fun with friends.

670
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,260
I'm sorry.

671
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,740
That's it.

672
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,880
This beat-em-up is only fun when you have friends to play this with.

673
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,680
Real.

674
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,080
True.

675
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,200
Friends.

676
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:43,980
Slop.

677
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
Oh, it's not slop.

678
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,560
It's literally the only reason it's fun.

679
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,580
That's what it's for.

680
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,760
That's why it's an arcade game.

681
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,040
Arcade games are fun when you're playing it with your friends.

682
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,680
This isn't hell.

683
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,280
Oh, it went straight to...

684
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,580
Capcon.

685
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,360
Oh, is this...

686
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,460
Uh...

687
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,260
Ghost...

688
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,280
Is this...

689
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,860
Oh, is this Onimusha?

690
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Yeah, this is Onimusha, the zombie.

691
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,120
I recognize the... the... zombies.

692
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Wait, why is he British?

693
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,140
Or Australian?

694
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,240
Or Australian?

695
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,120
Wait, can you talk again?

696
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,670
Did he just sound...

697
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,810
Because it's cool.

698
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,800
Do the suck!

699
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,660
Do the thing!

700
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,580
Was it?

701
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,860
Like...

702
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,060
Like...

703
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,820
Was that actually a Japanese accent?

704
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,840
With the... the main character.

705
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,380
Oh my god.

706
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,620
Low key core.

707
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,970
Oh, that looks so good.

708
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:19,970
Yes!

709
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,850
The suck!

710
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:21,630
Yes!

711
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,770
Give us what we want!

712
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,750
Oh!

713
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,950
Oh!

714
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,030
Hello.

715
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,630
I'm only here for the suck.

716
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,070
That was a new look at Onimusha, Way of the Sword...

717
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,170
I hope I get sponsored to play this new game.

718
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,530
It is coming in 2026 and will be playable this summer...

719
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:44,650
Please!

720
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,750
I played Onimusha 1 and 2 on stream.

721
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,170
I'm a real fan.

722
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,790
I'm not here...

723
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,930
I'm not one of those fake fans that only played Onimusha...

724
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,130
Onimusha 4 just because it got released.

725
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,890
...to create an insane digital puppeteering pipeline.

726
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,110
It's actually a thing.

727
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,330
What you're about to see is running completely in real time and unreal.

728
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,050
And I cannot wait to play it.

729
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,450
Here is an unexpected new game announcement...

730
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:10,890
What is it?

731
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,990
...that combines comedic storytelling and arcade fighting action.

732
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,730
Check this out.

733
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,250
I'm a real fan.

734
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,930
Oh, this is all in-game.

735
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,290
What the fuck is this?

736
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,010
An unadoptable orphan.

737
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,410
Is this like that...

738
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,350
What was it called?

739
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,510
The boxing game but with Muppets?

740
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,890
What was that boxing game?

741
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,830
From Nintendo.

742
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,610
But with Muppets.

743
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,170
Punch out.

744
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,470
It's Muppet Punch out.

745
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,350
It's- It's-

746
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,690
Chief or- Move, die!

747
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,840
Muppet out.

748
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,120
Oh, yeah, yeah boy.

749
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,920
Oh, yeah boy.

750
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:28,790
Eat red, grab burnt toe, car below- Wait, it is!

751
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,210
Wait, it is!

752
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,590
Muppet Punch out!

753
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,970
Oh my god!

754
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,630
Muppet felt that box.

755
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,250
Oh my god, it is!

756
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,850
What the fuck?

757
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,490
That's actual gameplay.

758
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,890
Holy shit.

759
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,210
Okay, that actually looks... I actually want to play that game.

760
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,110
That actually looks fun.

761
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,930
Day one by now.

762
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,290
Finally.

763
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,690
People were saying, like, oh man, Summer Game Fest has been so poor with game releases.

764
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,770
This, that game saved the entire show.

765
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,150
Summer Game Fest was saved by one trailer, and it was Muppet Punch-Out.

766
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,250
And Sonic Racing.

767
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,170
I can't wait for Muppet Mike Tyson.

768
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,050
Oh, is this Friend Slop?

769
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,070
Killer Inn.

770
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,570
It's Troubles and Terrors Town.

771
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,390
But, like...

772
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,870
Killer Inn is a murder mystery action game.

773
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,510
The killers lurk elusively in plain sight.

774
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,550
Kill someone, and a clue will remain.

775
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,830
Hair, fingerprints, blood, clothes.

776
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,970
The lambs scramble to find clues.

777
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,890
One step closer to unmasking the culprits.

778
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,410
Who is guilty will eventually come to light.

779
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,630
Wolves win by killing every lamb.

780
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,070
Lambs win by rooting out every wolf.

781
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,930
Such simple rules.

782
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,610
But there's so much more to this game of murder.

783
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,230
Yeah, it's Troubles and Terrors Town.

784
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,330
A quick quest to level up.

785
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,150
Buy items with the gold you earn.

786
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,070
Loot chests for weapons and armor.

787
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,550
Steel items blow up...

788
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,070
Oh, yeah, no.

789
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,010
This is 100% Friend Slop.

790
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,030
This...

791
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,770
This is a streamer game.

792
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,970
No, this is... this is a streamer game.

793
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,210
Victory are clear.

794
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,410
You would do well to remember.

795
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:28,830
Deceit and deduction are your strongest weapons in this game of life or death.

796
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,670
Your invitation...

797
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,130
By Square Enix...

798
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,610
Okay, I was gonna say the cosmetics.

799
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,530
Yeah, that makes sense.

800
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,290
I was gonna say Square Enix is pride of this?

801
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,690
That was for a 24-player multiplayer game from Square Enix where you compete in a game of life or death.

802
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,710
Yeah, I was like Square Enix developed this.

803
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,110
All right, it's hard to believe this next game was first announced at TGA in 2021.

804
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,070
And though it's been a while, their recent tech tests prove that some things are definitely worth the wait.

805
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,510
I'm, of course, talking about Ark Raiders.

806
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,350
This is one of the most anticipated games of the year.

807
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,270
And we're excited to share a new trailer, which will tell you more...

808
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,890
That's an extraction shooter, too, right?

809
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,630
...the world of Spranza and the long-awaited launch date coming later this year.

810
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,150
From Embark Studios, here's the world premiere of the release date trailer for Ark Raiders.

811
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,030
This is also an extraction shooter?

812
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,550
Yeah, but Doki, this is a good extraction shooter.

813
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,610
Okay, okay, everyone says that.

814
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,090
Everyone always says that.

815
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,430
Bro, so is like Marathon Killer.

816
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,070
You don't have to kill Marathon.

817
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,410
They already pulled the funding for it.

818
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,090
Yeah.

819
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,270
It can't be killed if it's sort of already on life support.

820
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,830
Surround yourself with resourceful friends.

821
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,130
Here, you.

822
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,240
I mean, it's been development for so long.

823
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,300
The only issue is that every FPS game, like, it has been, like, extraction shooter.

824
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,220
After extraction shooter.

825
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,680
I'm just tired of extraction shooters.

826
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,360
Everyone's trying to kill off Tarkov, but, like, Tarkov literally has, like, the hold on the player base.

827
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,490
Trust us, this will finally be the one.

828
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,430
That's right, that's why the War Operators is coming October 30th, 2025, for PC and console.

829
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,650
Only Tarkov will kill Tarkov.

830
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,030
They tried, though!

831
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,850
Tarkov did try to kill itself, but they, like, survived.

832
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,090
Don't you guys remember?

833
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:15,830
The whole thing about, like, the expansion pack or whatever was, like, X amount of money, and it lived.

834
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,730
And they, and they still, and they still lived through it.

835
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,150
Somehow, they, they still lived.

836
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,730
I'm, I'm personally tired of extraction shooters.

837
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:53,970
Like, even Tarkov can't be the one to, to, to, to kill their own game.

838
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:56,890
Is this Dune?

839
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,950
Is it good?

840
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,610
I heard it came out now.

841
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,170
I heard it's out now, isn't it?

842
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,370
It's an MMO, right?

843
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,490
No, it's an MMO.

844
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,980
Yeah, it's, like, a survival game.

845
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,740
The thing is, I didn't grow up watching Dune, so, like, I don't have any, like, nostalgia towards it.

846
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,600
Or, like, wanting to be in that world type deal.

847
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,180
No, I never watched any of the Dune movies, or read any of the books of Dune.

848
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,080
So, like, I have no, none of the nostalgia feeling, or, like, the feeling of wanting to be in the Dune universe.

849
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,040
So, me looking at this, I'm just like, alright.

850
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,200
I'm just like, alright.

851
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,600
Because I have no context whatsoever.

852
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,590
It's, like, it's, like, Arcane.

853
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,330
So, like, you know how, like, I refuse to watch Arcane?

854
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:24,190
Because, like, I don't, I'm scared of it making me like League of Legends, and wanting to play League of Legends, and I do not want that on, on me.

855
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:30,990
Like, I do not wish for that to happen to me.

856
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:37,110
Um, and, so, I've never watched Arcane.

857
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,090
And then, my friends would be like, you don't understand.

858
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,850
This person shows up, and then this thing happens.

859
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,270
And I was like, I have zero context of anything you say.

860
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:54,090
Like, like, I, I don't understand.

861
00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:02,970
Like, I, I, I've never heard, I don't know any lore, anything lore related to League.

862
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,990
So, like, none of that makes sense to me.

863
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,890
I, I, I, I, I,

864
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:41,250
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

865
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,950
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I The thing is, I'm scared.

866
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,250
But what if I actually get into League?

867
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,270
The only thing I know about League is KDA.

868
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,450
That's the only thing.

869
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:29,170
And Imagine Dragons, because for some reason they always hire them for all their songs.

870
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,710
And it all sounds... Okay, Hot Take.

871
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:42,470
Alright, I don't know what the fuck trailer I was just watching, but Hot Take, Imagine Dragons songs all sound the same to me.

872
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:46,530
I feel like it's just, it's all, it's so similar.

873
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,610
Is this Genshin?

874
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:52,950
Or...

875
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,690
Is this...

876
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,590
Oh, it's Wittering Waze?

877
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:00,250
Oh.

878
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,470
It's Wuwa.

879
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,230
Is that what you guys call it?

880
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:07,930
The Wuwas?

881
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,850
Oh my god, Wuwa.

882
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,830
What happened while I was...

883
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
So, I hear the...

884
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,600
The victors show no mercy to the defeated.

885
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,820
People here despise weakness, worship strength, and crave glory.

886
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,160
I never doubted that he would end up here.

887
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,840
I'm gonna be curious.

888
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,920
What ending have you penned for Septimont this time?

889
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Ooh!

890
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,600
Sponsor me!

891
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,420
A rat?

892
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:44,880
A rat?

893
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,420
Such a tiny nuisance.

894
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,260
I know all your secrets.

895
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,500
I mean, it looks pretty.

896
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,340
I feel like all the, like, really beautiful, pretty games are all, like, platformers.

897
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,260
I don't know.

898
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,260
They're all, like, platform-related type games.

899
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:21,080
Like, a lot of games that are, like, have, like, unique art styles, or, like, really interesting stories, are mostly platformers.

900
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,480
As part of NextFest.

901
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,460
What you're about to see next is a stop-motion co-op platformer.

902
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,120
Ooh!

903
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,700
See?

904
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,000
See?

905
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,460
Look at that!

906
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,040
Platformer!

907
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:29,480
Look at that!

908
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,480
Co-op stop-motion!

909
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,500
Look at that!

910
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,000
It's a platformer.

911
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,680
Oh, that's cute.

912
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,080
I like that.

913
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,960
It reminds me of the yarn game.

914
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:50,760
What's it called?

915
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,220
Oh, yeah, and it ticks, too.

916
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,180
It reminds me of the yarn game.

917
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:57,920
Unraveled.

918
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,660
Yeah, this reminds me of Un- This looks like Unraveled.

919
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,780
The art style's cute, though.

920
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,840
Don't you see?

921
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,180
We can't.

922
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,680
Come on, fight

923
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:17,770
it!

924
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,330
Yeah, it's Unraveled Core.

925
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:20,970
It's cute, though.

926
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,310
Out of words.

927
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,010
It's really cute.

928
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:26,870
I like the art style.

929
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,450
2026.

930
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,910
What a really unique and different game.

931
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:38,130
This August signals the release of Mafia The Old Country, the next entry in the acclaimed Mafia franchise from the team at Hangar 13.

932
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,450
I remember seeing that trailer when they previewed it.

933
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,450
I love Mafia.

934
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,390
Here is the Summer Game Fest trailer.

935
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,050
I love Mafia.

936
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,530
The trail burns because it can only come from someone close.

937
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,770
Mafia is such a good game.

938
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,010
I love the story.

939
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,170
I love you like a friend.

940
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,940
It's a me, Manuel.

941
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:01,740
I work here.

942
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,240
Sorry.

943
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,360
My family.

944
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,180
My beautiful daughter, Isabelle.

945
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,100
Yeah, TK.

946
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,200
TK makes the Mafia series.

947
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,540
They've always done the Mafia series.

948
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,440
You're breaking my heart.

949
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,280
You're gonna ruin the family.

950
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,400
If this is how it'll be.

951
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,060
The Dawn's noticed you, Enzo.

952
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,520
This is an opportunity.

953
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,460
Do you wish to commit to this family?

954
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,360
Oh.

955
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:47,740
Enzo!

956
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,760
We can't let them get away!

957
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,580
When Isabella became involved, it became our business.

958
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,980
I saw a shop.

959
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,920
That was like a witch shop today.

960
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,600
I almost bought a modern spell book.

961
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,540
But then I was like, no, that's a scam.

962
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,500
Because I was like, oh my, it would be cool if I bought this book.

963
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,300
And then just like read it to you guys.

964
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,640
And like start trying to cast some spells.

965
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,260
It was like modern witch spells.

966
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,660
And I was like, ooh.

967
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,440
And I was like, no.

968
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,080
Even as a joke.

969
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,520
That's too much money.

970
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,440
I was like, it's a funny joke stream.

971
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,960
But I was like, no.

972
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,160
This is a scam.

973
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,580
Like I was reading the spells.

974
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,720
I was like, aww.

975
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,410
Yeah, but Dopefield was funny.

976
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,150
It was worth it.

977
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:55,150
But yeah, it was like a sh- Like, you know like those like modern witchcraft shop- Witchcraft shops.

978
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,690
And it was like, I saw one.

979
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,270
And I was like, whoa.

980
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,790
That's- Oh my god.

981
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,880
Oh, that's cute.

982
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,060
Yeah, where they have- Oh, Duplo?

983
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,400
No, it's Lego!

984
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,420
It's not Duplo.

985
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,720
It's not for children.

986
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,480
Yeah, it's like a- It takes two, but what if you're Lego?

987
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,160
This is literally- It takes two, but Lego.

988
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,760
What the fuck is modern witchcraft?

989
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,300
It's- It's like- Lots of candles.

990
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,360
There were lots of candles.

991
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,800
Lots of like tarot cards.

992
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:49,160
They had like a whole collection of different- Okay, what's funny is like the capitalism of tarot cards.

993
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,340
Because there was like Game of Thrones tarot cards.

994
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:57,320
And like, like random fucking tarot cards from different brands and stuff.

995
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,620
And then lots and lots of crystals.

996
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,560
And those like, um, those like paper wrap things.

997
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,580
I don't know what it's called.

998
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,700
There's like- Oh, Summer Game Fest!

999
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,900
Like thick paper wrap things for like, uh- I'm Carol Morse, voice actor for a few familiar faces you might have grown up with on Nickelodeon.

1000
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,780
I don't know what it's called.

1001
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,500
Some with school suits, thank you.

1002
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,600
Some with science smarts and some with serious attitude.

1003
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,280
Nickelodeon has always been about wild worlds and weirder characters.

1004
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,320
And while I'm mostly sworn to secrecy today- Spongebob?

1005
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,740
I'm thrilled to have a hand in revealing something that brings a lot of those characters together like never before.

1006
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,620
I hope you enjoy the first look at Nicktoons and the Dias of Disney.

1007
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,860
Yeah, cause that's- that's Sadie.

1008
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,280
Yee!

1009
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,640
What?

1010
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,180
Nicktoons!

1011
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,660
Wait!

1012
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,960
Wait!

1013
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,220
A new Nicktoons game?

1014
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,500
A brave and wise- Oh my god!

1015
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,000
Wait!

1016
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,840
Is that Timmy?

1017
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,160
Wait!

1018
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,100
No way!

1019
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,560
Oh my god!

1020
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,620
I love Nicktoons!

1021
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,840
Oh my god!

1022
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,720
Oh my god!

1023
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,040
Spongebob?

1024
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,120
Danny Phantom?

1025
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,220
Timmy?

1026
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,300
Awww!

1027
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,170
Never have hope.

1028
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:40,250
It's been almost two years since players first stepped into the role of the puppet to save the speed of glass, disease, and puppet friends in Lies of He.

1029
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,050
Overture is a DLC expansion of Lies of He.

1030
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:51,730
The transport player is back in time with new characters, environments, and of course- If you hope, you'll only set yourself up for disappointment.

1031
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,890
Oh!

1032
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,870
The hope, the happiness just drained from her eyes!

1033
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:10,530
I legitimately thought it was gonna be the Nicktoon games with Danny Phantom, Timmy, Spongebob, and- I forgot the fourth- Jimmy Neutron.

1034
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,070
Was it Jimmy?

1035
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:11,510
I forgot!

1036
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,010
Who was the fourth person?

1037
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,370
I forgot the fourth guy.

1038
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,430
I- I- I- yeah, it was it Jimmy?

1039
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,370
It was- yeah, Jimmy, Danny, and- Timmy, and Spongebob.

1040
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,410
I-

1041
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:43,580
I dared to dream, only to- to be disappointed yet again.

1042
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,180
I don't wanna play Nicktoons on the stream.

1043
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,320
Oh my god.

1044
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,560
That actually, like, was my childhood.

1045
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,820
Like, I- I- I legitimately was- got so fucking happy thinking we were gonna get a new Nicktoon team.

1046
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,140
Like, they even got Sandy in- oh my god.

1047
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,260
I- I had so much hope.

1048
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:13,240
I was like, Nickelodeon creating a game, trying to do something outside of Spongebob?

1049
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,560
That's fucking crazy.

1050
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,180
Oh, look.

1051
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,720
Oh, new- oh, today!

1052
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,900
Lies of PDLC is today.

1053
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,480
Yes, that's right.

1054
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,880
Overture is available today across all platforms- Download now, guys!

1055
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,720
Download now, it's today!

1056
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:38,600
Next up, the small video game, publisher Serenity Forge, based in Boulder, Colorado- Shared this game with a few months back with a DM that said- Doki Doki Literature Club meets Silent Hill.

1057
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:39,980
That's me- oh!

1058
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,180
I was like, me?!

1059
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,000
I was like, me?!

1060
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,060
I was like, oh my god, Doki Bird!

1061
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,740
Oh, that's interesting.

1062
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,560
Doki Doki Literature Club with Silent Hill.

1063
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,620
And farming?!

1064
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,940
Oh, this is a horror farming game, isn't it?

1065
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,920
Isn't this a horror farming game?

1066
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,360
Was- didn't they have like, a preview of this game?

1067
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:15,080
Yeah, I remember there was a- the- there was like, a demo of it.

1068
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:31,100
The- there was like, a demo of it.

1069
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,900
Okay, how is this Doki Doki Literature Club?

1070
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,760
If they did like, Stardew Valley and Silent Hill?

1071
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,800
Like, that makes more sense.

1072
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:49,160
Like- I- where- where does the Doki Doki Literature Club come from?

1073
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,520
I- Fact- fractured blooms.

1074
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,260
There's a hunger that feeds and blooms.

1075
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,220
And I will feed.

1076
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,660
And I will bloom.

1077
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,040
I will bloom.

1078
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,880
Yeah, it's just looks- it's just a farming- Ooh, the artwork's pretty.

1079
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,140
It's just- it's a farming horror game.

1080
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,800
Isn't there like 3 different farming horror games that are coming out?

1081
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,120
Like...

1082
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,760
Where the fuck is the Doki Doki Literature Club coming from?

1083
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,160
Blade and Soul of Nioh.

1084
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:51,920
Now on Steam.

1085
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,100
I have...

1086
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,320
Oh, what's this?

1087
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,580
Is this Genshin?

1088
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,420
Oh no, it was still from that game.

1089
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,540
No, it's new.

1090
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:09,990
Oh look, you can be a dog!

1091
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,870
Not all anime games are Genshin.

1092
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,430
It's like, when you're like, is this Bloodborne?

1093
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,250
And I'm like, is this Genshin?

1094
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,010
We are not the same.

1095
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:43,890
Genshin?

1096
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,210
Wait, no, that guy is from that one show.

1097
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,890
Yeah, isn't that One Punch Man?

1098
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,770
Wait, what is he doing here?

1099
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,990
Wait, what is he?

1100
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,210
Wait, what's Sartama doing here?

1101
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:10,190
What is he doing?

1102
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:10,690
What?

1103
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,650
I'm so confused.

1104
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,850
What is he doing here?

1105
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,110
Jump Force?

1106
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,250
Oh my god, okay.

1107
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:27,470
If they ever announce Jump Force 2, I would be so fucking happy.

1108
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,490
Guys, Jump Force is another game that I wanna play.

1109
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,290
I wanna play on stream.

1110
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,650
There's so many games.

1111
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,670
Someone help me write down all the games that I say I wanna play on stream, because I'm gonna forget.

1112
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:41,430
I...

1113
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,650
No, of course.

1114
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:44,550
Guys, no.

1115
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,390
You guys need to know.

1116
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,790
My channel is all about ironic...

1117
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,990
Ironic...

1118
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:50,190
Ironic...

1119
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:50,490
Shit.

1120
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:55,030
I play a lot of games that are known to be not the greatest.

1121
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,470
I literally played...

1122
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,090
What's his name?

1123
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,270
World...

1124
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,690
The Balon Wonderland?

1125
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,350
I literally played Balon Wonderland on stream.

1126
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,210
Just cause I...

1127
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,110
Just cause I...

1128
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:07,010
I needed to know how bad it was.

1129
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,750
Bro, I just found out recently.

1130
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,570
Someone finally modded the game.

1131
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:21,610
Where like...

1132
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:23,450
There's...

1133
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,050
They added one more control into Balon Wonderland.

1134
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,990
Where the...

1135
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,490
Where it's not just...

1136
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,930
Where you can actually jump in the game.

1137
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:32,990
They...

1138
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,350
Someone...

1139
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:35,130
Someone...

1140
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,490
This year...

1141
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,610
Modded the game so you can finally...

1142
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,330
Jump.

1143
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,070
Without having to wear a costume.

1144
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:45,710
That's crazy.

1145
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:50,450
Revolutionary mod.

1146
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,090
And then the guy was like, I am not making more mods for this game.

1147
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:55,610
I just wanted to...

1148
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,570
Finally be able to jump.

1149
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,210
Okay, 7...

1150
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,470
I've never watched 7 Deadly Sins.

1151
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:05,710
So...

1152
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:06,550
I'm just like...

1153
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:06,690
Okay.

1154
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,500
5.6 is available today.

1155
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,780
5.6 is available today.

1156
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,100
This is a technological showcase set in the world of The Witcher 4.

1157
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,880
Human creator is now fully integrated into Unreal Engine.

1158
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,760
Oh, it's an advertisement for Unreal Engine.

1159
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,460
I can do that.

1160
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,420
I can do that.

1161
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,180
VTubers had that technology.

1162
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:36,620
Ha ha ha.

1163
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,060
Oh, thank you so much for the raid, guys.

1164
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,400
Also, thank you so much for the videos and sub.

1165
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,020
Sorry if I can't think the subs in time, guys.

1166
01:00:59,240 --> 01:00:59,900
Cause like...

1167
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,680
I have one monitor.

1168
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:01,700
And like...

1169
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,760
Right now...

1170
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,160
It's like...

1171
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,320
All I see is like...

1172
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,520
Chat.

1173
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:05,460
And...

1174
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,460
My OBS.

1175
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,620
I'm literally watching this through my OBS window.

1176
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,380
Oh!

1177
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,620
Is this a Jurassic World...

1178
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,140
Uh...

1179
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,540
To nurture...

1180
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,740
The zoo one.

1181
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,540
To find hope...

1182
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,800
Yeah, Jurassic World Evolution.

1183
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Awww.

1184
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,280
That's cute.

1185
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,080
Oh,

1186
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:48,560
nice!

1187
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,060
I like Jurassic World Evolution.

1188
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,060
That was fun.

1189
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,220
We worked so hard to get the fucking raptors last time.

1190
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,420
So I can recreate the Chris Pratt scene.

1191
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,960
It was worth it, though.

1192
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:07,700
It was worth it, just to recreate the Chris Pratt scene.

1193
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:14,760
We spent, like, hours trying to fucking get the raptors.

1194
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,040
Ten years ago, we broke new ground with our first game, Shovel Knight.

1195
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:19,880
Oh!

1196
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,760
They're actually making a new game?

1197
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:26,680
Today, I'm thrilled to share a world premiere look at our next IP, Mina the Hollower.

1198
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:33,200
Mina continues our traditions of refining retro gameplay for a new generation.

1199
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,940
It's a bone-chilling adventure that...

1200
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,860
What if this game comes up before Silk Song?

1201
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,700
All right, let's find out.

1202
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:45,420
As Mina, a whip-wielding Hollower, you'll burrow through danger...

1203
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,260
It will.

1204
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,220
Toki, please stop.

1205
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,000
A decade ago, we unearthed a groundbreaking legend.

1206
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:56,060
This year, we're bringing our next bonafide classic.

1207
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,300
Wow!

1208
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,620
Oh!

1209
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,940
Oh my gosh, she's a bride!

1210
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,800
Ha ha ha ha!

1211
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,800
Ten out of ten, she's a bride!

1212
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,200
Oh, this is actual retro retro, oh.

1213
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,280
That is heavy retro.

1214
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,060
Yeah, it's like color.

1215
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,400
It's like Game Boy.

1216
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,860
It's like Game Boy game.

1217
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,260
Yeah, no, it feels like a Game Boy game.

1218
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,760
Oh, yeah!

1219
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,900
Mickey Mousecapades, yeah!

1220
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,030
Game Boy Advance?

1221
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:44,490
Maybe.

1222
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,530
It feels like a game, like a game, like, I don't know which generation, but it feels like a Game Boy.

1223
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:48,950
All right.

1224
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,570
This is a special one.

1225
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:54,570
Our next game comes from a well-known developer that has done... Yeah.

1226
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,350
What?

1227
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:57,810
Kyle Bossman, everyone!

1228
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,270
Okay, was this scripted or real?

1229
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:02,810
Let's see what this says.

1230
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:08,950
Is it scripted or... or is it actual?

1231
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:09,250
Hey, Jeffy.

1232
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,010
Everything is scripted.

1233
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,490
If you're reading this, it means three things.

1234
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,470
Number one, you're killing it at the fest with your oodles of natural charisma.

1235
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:19,490
Oh, yeah.

1236
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,710
Hundred scripting.

1237
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:21,990
Available.

1238
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,930
B, I'm at your house playing long darts with the fam.

1239
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:30,370
And three, you're gonna do me a solid and skip that silksong trailer.

1240
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:35,170
So you can pick my revolutionary VR gaming venture that will shock the industry probably.

1241
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:38,530
A wet one on the lips, comma, waved.

1242
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,250
All right.

1243
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:41,910
Oh, Deadpool.

1244
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:43,310
It's Deadpool.

1245
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,610
I can't believe it.

1246
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,590
Deadpool killed silksong.

1247
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:48,570
I...

1248
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,090
And it's VR.

1249
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,670
Of course it is.

1250
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,550
Of course it is.

1251
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:58,350
VR killed silksong.

1252
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,470
I can't believe it.

1253
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:12,270
Do people even play VR games anymore other than fucking VR chat?

1254
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,790
I feel like VR was...

1255
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,390
VR games was such a...

1256
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,110
Was like an actual phase for gaming.

1257
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:27,010
Like, I don't know anyone that actually plays VR games outside of VR chat.

1258
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,470
I guess like Beat Rhythm games too.

1259
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,610
Yeah, and then Beat Rhythm.

1260
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,530
Beat Saber, yeah.

1261
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,170
Yeah, Beat Saber.

1262
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,070
I know VR still play VR for like...

1263
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,930
VR chat and Beat Saber.

1264
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,970
But I actually don't really know people that...

1265
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:55,750
I feel like...

1266
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,030
Or like Bruella Tag.

1267
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,990
Bruella Tag personally has like...

1268
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:01,430
Is incredibly popular with children.

1269
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:02,770
I don't know why.

1270
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:06,070
Brue...

1271
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,270
With Neil Patrick Harris's Deadpool.

1272
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:08,730
All right.

1273
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,430
Neil Patrick Harris?

1274
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,070
That was Neil!

1275
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:16,890
The culmination of a decade of Techland's experience building survival horror games.

1276
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:17,290
Legendary.

1277
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:22,270
How Crane is back as the player character in this title that blends open world and action survival horror.

1278
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,030
No way!

1279
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,330
Barney Stinson?

1280
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,730
That's Deadpool?

1281
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,310
Wait for it.

1282
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,140
I did not...

1283
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,920
I did not realize that was Neil Patrick Harris.

1284
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,340
The guy from the Smurfs movies?

1285
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,200
The guy from the Smurfs movies?

1286
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,060
I didn't realize he wasn't...

1287
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:45,380
Oh yeah!

1288
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,600
He was in Smurfs!

1289
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,440
He's a narcissistic sociopath.

1290
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,520
He's experimenting on humans like the lab rats.

1291
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,680
What is this?

1292
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,340
God only knows what the Baron's planning to do with those monsters.

1293
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,480
Dying light?

1294
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,220
Okay.

1295
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,220
Wait until...

1296
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,000
If he parkours, then we'll know.

1297
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,000
Genshin?

1298
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,100
Is this Genshin?

1299
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,100
Is this Genshin?

1300
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,620
He's not parkouring.

1301
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,460
How can he be dying light without...

1302
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,460
Without parkour?

1303
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,980
Okay, nevermind.

1304
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,620
It's dying light.

1305
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,380
Nevermind.

1306
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:30,160
Nevermind.

1307
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,040
There we go.

1308
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,780
There we go.

1309
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:32,600
There we go.

1310
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,260
But...

1311
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,980
Now it's dying light.

1312
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:41,820
I was like, you can't be dying light without parkour.

1313
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,460
Parkour!

1314
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,120
Parkour!

1315
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,960
It's like...

1316
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,660
This is...

1317
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,000
Zombie games will always have like one thing that will make them different from other zombie games.

1318
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,260
Dying light is parkour.

1319
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,240
Uh...

1320
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,260
Or other ones.

1321
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,240
Uh...

1322
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,640
Oh, August 22nd.

1323
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,020
Oh, wait.

1324
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,780
That's not...

1325
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,140
What is this?

1326
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:12,860
Dying light...

1327
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,880
Oh, is this a...

1328
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,340
DLC?

1329
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,100
Oh?

1330
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,600
Watch more.

1331
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,560
Oh, okay.

1332
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,080
There's more.

1333
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,920
Yeah, that has to be a DLC.

1334
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:31,260
Yeah.

1335
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,600
Dying light the beast.

1336
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,700
Dying light the beast is coming on August 22nd.

1337
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,380
Gamescom.

1338
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:36,760
Ooh.

1339
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:37,400
All right.

1340
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:43,980
This next game draws inspiration from classic coming-of-age films to capture the highs and lows of adolescence.

1341
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,520
The bonds of friendship...

1342
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,840
The highs and lows of football.

1343
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,600
Mixed cake comes from Beethoven Dinosaur and Annapurna Interactive.

1344
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:57,140
And this is your exclusive new look at this game that plays like a love letter to teenage memories.

1345
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,960
What are we doing?

1346
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:01,940
Oh?

1347
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,640
Oh.

1348
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,720
Hanging out.

1349
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,280
Getting buzzed.

1350
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,480
I've gotta get out.

1351
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,520
Did you know the 80s was 40 years ago?

1352
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:09,600
You hit the ball.

1353
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,380
Haha.

1354
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,140
Stop.

1355
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,140
To current enemies are up to kill.

1356
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:23,000
It's time to look back on your greatest hits.

1357
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:24,140
Doki, please.

1358
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,340
This is clearly 80s Core.

1359
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:41,500
This year, experience a retrospective like no other.

1360
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:46,800
Beethoven and Dinosaur invites you to relive the teenage riot.

1361
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,580
To spend one last night together, before school's out forever.

1362
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,200
Oh my god, they're TPing!

1363
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,180
You know what's crazy?

1364
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:06,400
The teenagers and the young adults that were playing this game, will have no nostalgia over this.

1365
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:12,880
They'll be like... To them, this would be like a weird... They'll be like, ooh, what's this?

1366
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,560
Experience it for yourself.

1367
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,460
Mixtape.

1368
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,860
Nothing but the ones.

1369
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:25,220
Yeah, because they'll be like, what the... I know like the young ones, like Gen Z or whatever, are like, what's a mixtape?

1370
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,820
The Genshin?

1371
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,100
The Genshin?

1372
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,200
Eventually they'll have a Genshin-ần jersey, right?

1373
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,060
Yeah, I find your destiny i see it.

1374
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,720
There is no escaping it.

1375
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,800
Eventually they'll be right.

1376
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,420
This is Touhou?

1377
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,140
I got Catie... She's so embarrassed and so sorry.

1378
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,000
She sort of looked like Toho for a second.

1379
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,600
Ah, it's cute.

1380
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,320
Toki, please.

1381
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,980
Toki, why are you like this?

1382
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,040
She sort of looked like that Toho girl for like one second.

1383
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,480
Okay, her staff looked like the Toho girl.

1384
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,160
Oh, is this Hades?

1385
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,240
Are your eyes okay?

1386
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,140
Guys, is it sort of obvious that the only thing I know about Toho is...

1387
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:47,300
is the little balls that come out and then also bad apple?

1388
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,660
Is it obvious?

1389
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,260
Because everyone would be like, oh look, they're Toho-ing.

1390
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:53,740
Toho!

1391
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,660
It's almost... oh my god, I was almost correct.

1392
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,400
Look, her name is Toa.

1393
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,720
It's just like Toho.

1394
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,040
Oh my god!

1395
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:05,920
Toho, Toho!

1396
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,480
I'm almost... it's practically the same thing.

1397
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,180
...with a whimsical spin on eastern mysticism.

1398
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,720
Next, we want to introduce you to a game made by a first-time solo developer in Bangung, Indonesia.

1399
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:24,160
With the help of nine of his friends, he's built an intense action beat-em-up with brutal hand-to-hand combat set in the hometown.

1400
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:24,520
Wait!

1401
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:24,680
Fuck!

1402
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,400
This is Axe of Blood.

1403
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,460
Oh, I thought that was the potato.

1404
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:30,900
Or...

1405
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,000
Sorry!

1406
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,760
I was like, oh my god!

1407
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,080
Is that... what was it called?

1408
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,220
The hunt isn't over.

1409
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,640
Killer Bean!

1410
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:42,980
Killer Bean!

1411
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:43,040
Sorry!

1412
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,340
I thought that was a bean!

1413
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,700
I was like, oh my god!

1414
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,820
Is this Killer Bean?

1415
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,380
A solo developer beat-em-up?

1416
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:49,880
Haha!

1417
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:50,740
Legit!

1418
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,320
I thought...

1419
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,720
I thought he was gonna be talking about Killer Bean!

1420
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,680
I was so hyped!

1421
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,260
I was so excited!

1422
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,720
I mean, this looks fucking cool, though.

1423
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,100
He said, solo developer beat-em-up?

1424
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,540
Of course the first thing I thought of was Killer Bean.

1425
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:08,780
Haha!

1426
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,760
You're getting so...

1427
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,100
Okay!

1428
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,480
Killer Bean is...

1429
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,140
Game of the Year.

1430
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,640
You can't change my mind.

1431
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:17,760
After...

1432
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,280
Okay, if...

1433
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,360
If the Sonic racing game doesn't come out...

1434
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,880
At the same time as Killer Bean, then Killer Bean is Game of the Year.

1435
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,560
I'm aiming for a solo dev with nine...

1436
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,760
Okay, solo dev with nine of his friends?

1437
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:38,780
That...

1438
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,940
Is he a solo dev, or is he...

1439
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,820
A dev with nine friends?

1440
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,430
Sifu with guns.

1441
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,230
Jeez.

1442
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:53,750
Axe of Blood.

1443
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,330
That's really...

1444
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,050
Good, though.

1445
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:56,810
The game looks nice.

1446
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:02,210
Amazing what these solo devs can do today.

1447
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,390
Now it is time for the reveal of the next...

1448
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,090
What about his nine friends, Jeff?

1449
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:11,510
The makers of TMNT Shredder's Revenge and Marvel Cosmic Invasion, which you saw a little bit earlier.

1450
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:14,470
If you're like me, you've been waiting for more than a decade.

1451
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:17,490
Sifu, if he wasn't a fucking coward.

1452
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,290
If he had seafood...

1453
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,570
Can't use a gun.

1454
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,590
Oh, Toronto.

1455
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:24,870
Yay!

1456
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:26,690
Goodbye, Toronto.

1457
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,130
The Vegans.

1458
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:28,590
Okay.

1459
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:30,090
I...

1460
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:33,130
I don't think I'm afraid of a group called The Vegans.

1461
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:33,750
I'm sorry.

1462
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:38,710
If the other two were literally the robots and the demons...

1463
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,390
Wait!

1464
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,470
Is that...

1465
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:41,230
Oh my god!

1466
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,430
Is this Scott Pilgrim?

1467
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:45,050
Oh my god!

1468
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,490
It's Scott Pilgrim!

1469
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:49,590
Hmm...

1470
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,410
I haven't seen my Manic Pixie Girl.

1471
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,450
Oh, that...

1472
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,750
But yeah, I swear to you, like...

1473
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,630
The Vegans?

1474
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:58,470
The Robots?

1475
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:59,290
Or the Demons?

1476
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,640
Like, I'm sorry, but like...

1477
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:06,110
Why would you be afraid of the Vegans if there's Robots and Demons?

1478
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:11,370
And now the Vegans makes sense.

1479
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,710
They're very scary.

1480
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,650
Have you seen them?

1481
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,090
Yeah, this is a new peanut, I'm pretty sure.

1482
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,110
I think...

1483
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,290
The Scott Pilgrim movie was ahead of its time.

1484
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:34,930
I think if the Scott Pilgrim movie was released later in the year...

1485
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,410
later on...

1486
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:38,390
Oh, it's an EX, so they...

1487
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,190
It's like a...

1488
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:40,610
Director's Cut.

1489
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:44,990
Scott Pilgrim is back with his fist flying in a brand new brawling adventure in EX.

1490
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:48,570
You'll battle through space-time and the streets of my hometown of Toronto...

1491
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:48,930
It is a...

1492
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,290
It is honestly...

1493
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,370
Because it was a box office bust.

1494
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:54,930
It wasn't...

1495
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,850
It didn't do well financially.

1496
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,190
But I feel like if they released it...

1497
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,350
Like just...

1498
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,130
Three to four years later...

1499
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,470
That movie would do really well.

1500
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,510
Her performance...

1501
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:07,990
In Resident Evil Village.

1502
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:09,350
Woo!

1503
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,350
Oh!

1504
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:17,150
We've been preparing delightful ways to make you suffer.

1505
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,170
Oh, wait!

1506
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:19,150
So enter the village if you dare.

1507
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,070
So enter the village if you dare.

1508
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:23,850
We slash the price to be lower than ever for you simple little man things.

1509
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,450
Still thirsty?

1510
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:28,970
Worry not, you ungrateful wretch.

1511
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:31,830
But there's plenty more fun to go around.

1512
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,350
Now cease this foolishness.

1513
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:36,590
And make your decision wise.

1514
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:38,210
I'm looking at the Twitch chat.

1515
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,250
You and them are...

1516
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,310
Oh no.

1517
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:44,590
Uh...

1518
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,510
You and them are the same.

1519
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:48,970
I'm looking at the...

1520
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,510
The official broadcast of the Twitch chat.

1521
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:52,710
Oh, okay.

1522
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:53,750
Is that...

1523
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,290
What's it called?

1524
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:55,950
Oh wait, no.

1525
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:56,970
They said the game name.

1526
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:57,690
The first...

1527
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:58,710
Yeah, it's first to send it.

1528
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:10,840
Wow!

1529
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,240
Since the dawn of time...

1530
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,300
I wonder what would be the last game announcement.

1531
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,220
Humankind has been obsessed with the hard.

1532
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:37,680
Alright, guys.

1533
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,320
Predictions.

1534
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,380
What do you think would be the final game trailer?

1535
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,520
That's so sorry.

1536
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,000
Hahaha.

1537
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:44,980
Now...

1538
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,580
A glorious morning has dawned...

1539
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,720
On something that simply...

1540
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:53,440
Hard.

1541
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,460
This game already looks...

1542
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:56,560
I don't know.

1543
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:57,440
I...

1544
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:57,840
Scum.

1545
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,920
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1546
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,800
This game already looks...

1547
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,400
I don't know.

1548
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:08,790
Eat hard.

1549
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,740
Oh, there's mechas at least.

1550
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,660
Version 1.0 full launch.

1551
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,660
I mean, this looks interesting.

1552
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:28,600
But I don't know.

1553
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,760
I don't know.

1554
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:30,800
I don't know.

1555
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,100
I don't know.

1556
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:32,720
I don't know.

1557
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,100
I don't know.

1558
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:33,620
Not in...

1559
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,440
I would say interesting.

1560
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,460
It looks like something fun to play with friends for a few months.

1561
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,100
Or a couple of weeks.

1562
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,220
Come with me.

1563
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,530
It's like a...

1564
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,430
Just like a...

1565
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,450
Sandbox-type deal.

1566
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,520
Oh!

1567
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,240
Oh...

1568
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,080
New IP?

1569
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,040
Alright, predictions.

1570
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,560
New IP or... or... Sequel?

1571
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,640
Where's the gameplay?

1572
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,160
Okay, you're asking way too much in the Summer Game Fest.

1573
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,340
You're at MindEyesGame.

1574
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:51,080
It's literally coming out this month, and this is the first time I've heard about this game.

1575
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,180
Wait, what?

1576
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,500
What the fuck?

1577
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,360
Wait, what?

1578
01:19:59,220 --> 01:19:59,700
Hitman?

1579
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,640
I'm Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Attractive.

1580
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:11,680
We can't wait for you to discover MindSight when it launches on June the 10th from Build-A-Rocket Boy and IO Partners.

1581
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,480
And yes, you may have noticed...

1582
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,860
I feel like this is the first time I've heard of this game.

1583
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,100
It was shown last year.

1584
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,940
That is how much I don't remember.

1585
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:24,140
That's how generic it was.

1586
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:28,420
That was so generic that I don't even remember it from last year.

1587
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,680
This week we finally revealed 007 First Light to the world.

1588
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,680
Finally, real food.

1589
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,480
Finally, we can be fed.

1590
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,240
It's coming in 2026.

1591
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,860
But we want to make the wait more exciting.

1592
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:49,920
We are bringing someone into Hitman, the world of assassination, who is very dear to the Bond universe.

1593
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,420
Let's take a look.

1594
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:52,340
Huh?

1595
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,680
Another announcement?

1596
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,320
Who?

1597
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,880
Oh my god, Tom Cruise.

1598
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,880
Who knows?

1599
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:09,180
Your target is the elusive shadow banker, known only as Le Chiffre, a financial mastermind was suspected...

1600
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:09,180
Wait!

1601
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,440
Mads... Mads... Mads...

1602
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:11,740
Mads...

1603
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:11,780
Mads...

1604
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,280
Mickelson?

1605
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,060
Wait!

1606
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,660
That's the first...

1607
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,600
The first...

1608
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,620
James Bond...

1609
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,420
Not the first, sorry.

1610
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,140
I meant...

1611
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,700
From Casino Royale.

1612
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,580
The first movie in Casino Royale.

1613
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:23,920
Yeah.

1614
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,040
Mr. Rengang.

1615
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,420
He's too impatient, and Miss Bai, well...

1616
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,620
She likes a drink.

1617
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,460
Don't know about the newcomer, Mr. Smith, though.

1618
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,340
He's the only wild card.

1619
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,640
Well, this is turning into an interesting evening.

1620
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,500
Welcome to the VIP room here at the Casino Monarchic.

1621
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,300
Reaper.

1622
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,080
Unusual name.

1623
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,900
Names are for fragments.

1624
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:51,900
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Le Chiffre?

1625
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,640
Le Chiffre?

1626
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:56,300
I still can't believe Mads...

1627
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:56,320
uh...

1628
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:57,760
Mickelson...

1629
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,740
Is...

1630
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,300
Um...

1631
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,200
Was in that...

1632
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,140
The Lion King Mufasa movie, and he was the one that went...

1633
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:04,620
Bye-bye!

1634
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,940
I can't believe that was him!

1635
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,180
He was the one that was like...

1636
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:09,940
Bye-bye!

1637
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,340
However...

1638
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,120
Hitman is live right now.

1639
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,620
He was the one that did...

1640
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:16,080
Bye-bye!

1641
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,140
And I asked a fellow Danish friend to join me here.

1642
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,380
As a matter of fact, he is here with us...

1643
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,420
Yes, that was him!

1644
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,000
He was...

1645
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,060
He was the...

1646
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:25,260
He was the...

1647
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,120
He was the main lion!

1648
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,240
He was the main evil lion!

1649
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,500
Oh my god!

1650
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,640
He has such a unique face.

1651
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,840
I didn't even realize he was Danish.

1652
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,380
He plays...

1653
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,140
Oh my god, he's so old now.

1654
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:41,600
Oh my...

1655
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,140
I already knew him from Hannibal.

1656
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:48,340
But you're also Agent 47's next target as Le Chiffre, the villain we know from Casino Royale.

1657
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,680
How old is he now?

1658
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,040
That's it.

1659
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,580
He's so old now.

1660
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,960
I've always had a deep love for this character.

1661
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,560
It's a role that means a lot to me, because of a lot of reasons.

1662
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,500
So, when Haggard gave me the chance to step into the chutes of Le Chiffre once again...

1663
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,320
He's 60!

1664
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,980
He's literally a grandpa!

1665
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,060
He's a gilf!

1666
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,780
He's more confident.

1667
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:09,560
He's dangerous.

1668
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,360
He's not just bringing mine, hiding behind a desk.

1669
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,700
He's visceral, unpredictable, and ruthless.

1670
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,380
I was like, that's my sugar daddy right there!

1671
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,100
You'd be sugar grandpa!

1672
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:31,260
So this mission is set in a casino in Paris.

1673
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:37,520
We want to make an homage to the movie Casino Royale, while keeping surprises for our players.

1674
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,300
James Bond and Agent 47 have a very different set of skills.

1675
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,100
I think it's the beard.

1676
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,660
The beard makes him look even older.

1677
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,560
And the mission will be handled in very different creative ways.

1678
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,660
Yeah, he's not gonna beat me in poker.

1679
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,380
He's gonna figure something else out.

1680
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,760
No, I guess it is not just about the shot.

1681
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,720
It's about the bluffing around the table this time?

1682
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,740
Yeah, sure, exactly.

1683
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,320
Le Chiffre is always like two steps ahead of you.

1684
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:04,180
He reads you before you read him, so it's a little like bringing a chess player to a poker game.

1685
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:11,400
We built a mission to allow several parts, unexpected characters, appearances, and even custom poker mechanics.

1686
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,420
Wow!

1687
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,600
You can play poker in Hitman?

1688
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:15,120
Nice!

1689
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:15,680
That's the best part.

1690
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:20,840
We wanted to surprise you, so the team is updating the game as we speak.

1691
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:21,620
Oh!

1692
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:25,780
Oh!

1693
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,720
Oh, it's launching today!

1694
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,780
Wait, what does this say?

1695
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,980
And if you play it, you will unlock a unique reward in 007 first life.

1696
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,220
Wait, it's only for 30 days?

1697
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,120
Wait, you can only download this for 30...

1698
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,860
You can only play this for 30 days, though?

1699
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,560
That sucky suck.

1700
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,180
Yeah.

1701
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:46,900
Great stuff.

1702
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,520
Alright, now here's the announcement of a new party game coming later this year.

1703
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:50,640
Bye-bye!

1704
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,020
I think it's copyright.

1705
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:52,460
I think.

1706
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:56,960
With over 1 million LEGO bricks, 300 minifigures, and over 700 trillion minifigure companies.

1707
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:56,980
Yeah.

1708
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,620
I mean, I'm down and play it just for the event.

1709
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,400
If it's just 30, like 30 days.

1710
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,500
I think it had to be...

1711
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,320
I think it's related to copyright.

1712
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,080
Cause, like, sometimes, like, it's very expensive.

1713
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:12,300
Especially if it's, like, based off a movie and stuff.

1714
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:13,900
Um...

1715
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,160
For, like, like, uh, to pay, like, copyright for the movie company.

1716
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,100
To use the character.

1717
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:30,200
Is World of Assassination just like that?

1718
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:32,340
I don't know.

1719
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,240
I feel like the licensing is also not that cheap, though.

1720
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,400
I don't mind playing the...

1721
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,440
Playing that on stream.

1722
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:45,440
Just cause it's only 30 days, so it's, you know...

1723
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,220
I hate limited...

1724
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:48,580
Aw, man.

1725
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,580
I hate limited time events.

1726
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,440
If it's, like, something cool like that.

1727
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,740
Oh, this is like...

1728
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:55,780
Oh!

1729
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,140
It's Mario Party!

1730
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,540
It's LEGO Mario Party!

1731
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,340
Oh, it's literally called LEGO Party.

1732
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1733
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,140
Alright, is this $50?

1734
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:15,740
Is it...

1735
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1736
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:17,960
Alright.

1737
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,620
I need to know, though.

1738
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:20,240
I need to know, though.

1739
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:20,660
How much?

1740
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:24,100
Are they gonna make you pay $40 to $80?

1741
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:24,700
No, wait.

1742
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,600
No, Doki.

1743
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,540
It's $80.

1744
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1745
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:30,360
You're right.

1746
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:30,920
I forgot.

1747
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,080
New games are...

1748
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,600
You're like...

1749
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,500
Guys, remember when everybody complained about how expensive Switch 2 and the games are?

1750
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,220
...and the open beta starts next week.

1751
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:39,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1752
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:39,800
Remember that?

1753
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,100
Fucking hypocrites.

1754
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,780
You guys, I knew you guys would just fucking eat that shit up.

1755
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,440
No matter.

1756
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:46,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1757
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1758
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,180
Let's see what it means to getting into some serious...

1759
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:52,880
We can't have this happen.

1760
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,540
And then the moment of Switch 2 comes out, everyone's posting pictures.

1761
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,440
Posting pictures of it.

1762
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,500
Like, talking about Mario Kart and everything.

1763
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,600
And I'm just like, fucking hypocrites.

1764
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,160
I know.

1765
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,440
I knew it.

1766
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,660
I called it out.

1767
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:09,020
I was like, they can do anything they want.

1768
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,940
And you guys will eat that shit up no matter what happens.

1769
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1770
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1771
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,220
Nintendo can do whatever the fuck they want.

1772
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,760
And you'll be like yum yum.

1773
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:25,400
Yummy yummy.

1774
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1775
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,140
Now, their ship is flying.

1776
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,340
I didn't buy...

1777
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,520
I didn't pre-order the Switch 2 or bought the Switch 2.

1778
01:27:39,520 --> 01:28:05,600
because I never buy consoles on launch because usually there's something wrong with there will always be something wrong on launch so I just wait I don't I'm I I don't care much about FOMO I'm proud to reveal to you the next game from Toronto based drink box studios the team behind the The hype joke is missing out.

1779
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,520
Who the fuck is doing a hype train on the Summer Games Award?

1780
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:17,580
Dude... There's a hype train on the Summer Games Award.

1781
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:18,520
What the fuck?

1782
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,980
Jeff does not need that money.

1783
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,140
They're literally paying Jeff to do this, these trailer announcements.

1784
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,140
Oh, hey!

1785
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:29,980
Guacca!

1786
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,220
That game was fun.

1787
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,160
They don't... Yeah, Guacca made it.

1788
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,820
I saw that.

1789
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,620
That's a funny game.

1790
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,900
Yeah, that... Yeah, we did.

1791
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,260
It's at level 11?!

1792
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,560
That's what the fuck!

1793
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,140
His hype train's at level 12, guys!

1794
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,180
I...

1795
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,600
He has a level 12 hype train right now.

1796
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,940
Spreading this blight.

1797
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,060
You hover it too, I see.

1798
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,780
This seems Hades-like.

1799
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:16,800
A little.

1800
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,080
Oh!

1801
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,120
Jesus!

1802
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:25,440
I'm not that sold on the... Not gonna lie, for me, I'm not that sold on the art style.

1803
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,680
Should you fall?

1804
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,780
Pray the vultures consume you before the Black Deaths.

1805
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:34,740
It's like... It feels... I know that... Oh my god, that's... That's freaky.

1806
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:39,560
Uh... For me, I'm not too sold on the art style.

1807
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:44,500
The 3D portion looks way too 3D when it's mixed with the 2D.

1808
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,900
Lighted coming up right after the show in Day of the Devs.

1809
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,900
Alright, next is a first-person survival action horror game from Team 5.

1810
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:55,780
Like, when I saw the horse... The dead horse... Um... I wasn't like... I don't know.

1811
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,220
The art style was like, not my favorite.

1812
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,200
The 3D looked a little out of place, yeah.

1813
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,180
That's how I felt.

1814
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:08,220
Zombie game?

1815
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,160
Oh hey, it's Mudfish again.

1816
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:12,880
Wait, they're everywhere.

1817
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:14,580
Ooh, Team Cloud.

1818
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,230
Oh... Ooh...

1819
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:23,870
Ahhhh!

1820
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,350
Okay, these zombies look freaky.

1821
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:32,450
I'm a little... These zombies give... These zombies... Oh god, okay.

1822
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:36,930
These zombies give a very, very uncanny valley.

1823
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:41,870
Like...

1824
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:46,010
There's something weird of how they look like.

1825
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,230
It's very uncanny.

1826
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:52,390
Yeah, they look so... They're like a little... It's like a baby...

1827
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:55,490
Like... They're like fucking smooth as hell for some reason.

1828
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,530
Oh god.

1829
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,830
Okay, but is this like...

1830
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:02,810
Is this a tech demo or an actual gameplay?

1831
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:05,430
We're not trying to get watchdogs here.

1832
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:06,330
Like...

1833
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,230
I don't know.

1834
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:12,610
I wonder if this is... Is this actual gameplay or...

1835
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,370
Or like... Is this a tech demo?

1836
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,990
Cause this looks really good for a real gameplay.

1837
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:25,130
Yeah, they look way too...

1838
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:25,290
Oh!

1839
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,870
Oh!

1840
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:26,730
Oh!

1841
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:27,630
I'm closing my eyes.

1842
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:28,170
I can't.

1843
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:29,810
Oh, I... I...

1844
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:30,990
Oh my god, I kicked a baby!

1845
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:34,050
I...

1846
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,990
I do not like what they look like.

1847
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:37,610
I...

1848
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:38,410
I...

1849
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:38,650
I...

1850
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:38,670
I...

1851
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:43,010
Yes, okay.

1852
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:43,870
I didn't know.

1853
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:46,330
They're just way too moisturized for zombies.

1854
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,450
Cause you know how zombies are supposed to be like...

1855
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,570
Rotten, dead, dry.

1856
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:50,750
I...

1857
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:53,110
I don't like how shiny they are.

1858
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,330
I was like...

1859
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:55,470
Someone...

1860
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,810
It's like somebody put like...

1861
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,570
Baby oil...

1862
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:58,610
On all these zombies.

1863
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:59,770
And I don't like it.

1864
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:00,510
Well...

1865
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:01,530
Yeah, they're like...

1866
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,230
It's like...

1867
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:03,310
Yeah...

1868
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,390
Hey, make a break.

1869
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:20,430
Oh...

1870
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,020
Ouch...

1871
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:26,600
That's so funny...

1872
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:31,180
Nice and salty...

1873
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:31,740
Yak...

1874
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:35,020
Oh, it wouldn't None!

1875
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:03,860
I

1876
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,900
mean, it looks nice.

1877
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:11,960
The CGI.

1878
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:31,090
Okay, that looks fucking cool.

1879
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:34,230
Oh my god, okay.

1880
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:39,610
I'm sorry for those who are jamming right now and being really fucking hyped about Mecha Break.

1881
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:43,130
But like, this is just all CGI so there's no gameplay.

1882
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:45,010
So I'm just like vibing.

1883
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:49,190
But like, I love all the memes about the new Marvel fighting game.

1884
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:57,050
With like, Capcom getting cucked and Marvel going away with, what's that, the other studio?

1885
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:59,470
I love all those memes.

1886
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:01,110
They're so fucking funny.

1887
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:13,910
Yeah, with like Marvel and Arc Systems works walking away and then Capcom in the corner being like, I don't understand.

1888
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:19,330
I love those memes.

1889
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:20,270
They're so funny.

1890
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:27,490
Yeah, I know they showed gameplay Mecha Break, but like, I don't know.

1891
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:45,750
I think it's just me being like, it's been me watching these trailers and stuff from game shows for so many years now that like, in-game, like CGI stuff, just like, if they're showing mostly CGI, I like mostly tune out.

1892
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:48,370
Because I just want to know what the game actually looks like.

1893
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:51,390
Because it can be really fucking beautiful, the CGI and everything.

1894
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:54,850
But like, if the game fucking sucks, like, I...

1895
01:34:54,850 --> 01:35:04,790
I know, I know the gameplay's out there for Mecha Break, because it's been out for a bit.

1896
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:10,250
But I'm just like, when I'm watching trailers, I like, tune out of like CGI trailers.

1897
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,840
Because I'm mostly like this.

1898
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,240
I want to see the gameplay.

1899
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,480
I want to see how it is when I'm actually playing the game.

1900
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,220
Not when I'm watching a movie.

1901
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:25,300
Wait.

1902
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,120
Yeah, this looks like Grounded with Guns.

1903
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:31,540
We find a way.

1904
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,260
Ooh, this looks interesting.

1905
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,680
Yeah, it looks like Grounded with Guns.

1906
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:40,920
Yeah.

1907
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:47,380
Wait,

1908
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:53,340
what?

1909
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,760
Which one?

1910
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:56,960
There's so many.

1911
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,920
Happy birthday to you.

1912
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,520
To you.

1913
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,180
Oh, Resident Evil.

1914
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,540
Oh.

1915
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,520
Wait, is this the final game trailer?

1916
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,900
Wait, is this how they're ending it?

1917
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:11,840
Day.

1918
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,400
Happy birthday.

1919
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:15,640
Huh?

1920
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:24,680
And to celebrate early, a special message from Takeuchi-san.

1921
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:27,920
Huh?

1922
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:33,900
Guys.

1923
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,280
Guys, I think this is the ending trailer, guys.

1924
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:43,280
There's no way Resident Evil is not the ending trailer for the showcase.

1925
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,300
Wait, that's it?

1926
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,600
Oh, Baited again.

1927
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,560
Thank you, Takuchi-san, for that very special message.

1928
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,200
We cannot wait for when the time is right to share more, leading into the anniversary of the Resident Evil.

1929
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,780
Now it's time for the next big update.

1930
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,400
We got baited.

1931
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:15,120
Aww.

1932
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:17,400
God, why?

1933
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:23,740
Every time I start feeling hope, I can't believe it.

1934
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:34,270
Who's Kenny Omega?

1935
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:44,010
Oh, it's a wrestler.

1936
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:44,590
Oh!

1937
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,000
What the fuck?

1938
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,500
Okay.

1939
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,900
What the fuck is going on?

1940
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:03,580
Ingrid?

1941
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:25,060
Oh, that's how they announced the new characters for Street Fighter 6?

1942
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:26,420
Is that it?

1943
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:31,450
Oh!

1944
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:32,450
Oh shit!

1945
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:33,970
A million dollars.

1946
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,160
What's this?

1947
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:48,060
Holy shit, this has been almost a two-hour summary game fest.

1948
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:18,160
This looks like a good game for- if that's because of lobbies, it looks like a fun game for your members.

1949
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,560
No, it looks like a battle royale.

1950
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,760
Wouldn't it be funny if this is an extraction shooter?

1951
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:36,660
What- Oh, it's a- is this a hero shooter?

1952
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,680
Oh, it's a hero shooter.

1953
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,480
It's not bad.

1954
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,820
It's a hero shooter.

1955
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:50,670
But, like, capture the flag.

1956
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:53,890
But, like, capture the flag.

1957
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,830
Yeah, it's capture the flag, hero shooter.

1958
01:39:58,870 --> 01:40:01,790
But, like, Hades related?

1959
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:39,840
That was Last Flag, a new online action game from the new indie studio Night Street Games, which is the ultimate game of capture the flag set in the 1970s, as you saw.

1960
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,080
Oh no, I said 80s.

1961
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,040
Not Hades.

1962
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:53,380
Next, we have a beautiful new trailer for a souls-like action RPG game developed in China by Lenzi, Wu Chang, Fallen Feathers, which is launching on July 24th.

1963
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:56,220
Oh, that's not- that's quite soon.

1964
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:57,760
I never heard of this one before.

1965
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:01,760
Oh.

1966
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:06,720
I feel like there's- Oh.

1967
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,300
Yeah, I remember this being teased previously.

1968
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,120
Oh, yeah, I remember!

1969
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,040
I remember this.

1970
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:14,620
I remember seeing this.

1971
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:15,860
I thought it looked really interesting.

1972
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,820
Cause it's based off of, like, uh...

1973
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:21,500
Um...

1974
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,040
Was it based off of Chinese mythologies, right?

1975
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:26,460
Yeah.

1976
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,560
I remember being really interested in this.

1977
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:34,970
Yeah.

1978
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,330
It was based off of Chinese.

1979
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:39,210
Cause I remember I saw, like, the wheeled kid.

1980
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:40,930
The- the fire wheeled kid.

1981
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,350
Yeah.

1982
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:51,830
Neza.

1983
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:55,110
Isn't he in there?

1984
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:55,950
Right?

1985
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:58,450
He was in there, right?

1986
01:41:58,450 --> 01:41:58,510
Okay.

1987
01:41:58,730 --> 01:42:00,850
What will it take...

1988
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,310
To finally...

1989
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:03,390
Awaken you?

1990
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:06,630
Yeah, I remember.

1991
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:07,710
Cause I was like, oh!

1992
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,570
Oh, all the outfits are cute!

1993
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,630
The outfits are cute.

1994
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:16,170
I'm- I'm excited for that game.

1995
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:17,390
That game looks really fun.

1996
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:18,930
And I like Chinese mythologies.

1997
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:19,090
Guys.

1998
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:19,450
All.

1999
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:20,630
Gotta rescue Mom.

2000
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,630
This is what we gotta protect.

2001
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:24,230
We cannot choose where we call people's dreams get smashed.

2002
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:27,470
What's this?

2003
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:37,990
Where is the Wu-Tang Clan?

2004
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:39,250
What's that?

2005
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:39,690
What?

2006
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:42,410
Is it the Wu-Tang Clan?

2007
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:44,550
Make...

2008
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:45,930
No way?

2009
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:48,230
What?

2010
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:50,010
Wu-Tang Rise?

2011
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:50,450
It's...

2012
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:56,890
Wait, the Wu-Tang Clan made a video game?

2013
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:07,150
Rise of the Receiver.

2014
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:10,290
Presented by GhostfaceKiller.

2015
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:14,050
From rappers to game developers.

2016
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:14,730
Damn.

2017
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:16,890
I was like so...

2018
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:23,150
It looks cool, the art style.

2019
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:29,250
A new title from the 53-member Brass Lion Entertainment.

2020
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:35,910
Now, here's a new look at Guild Wars 2, which has new updates, including player housing, and is free to play.

2021
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:41,630
This weekend, to celebrate SGF, you can take advantage of double XP, all weekend long.

2022
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:47,060
MMO.

2023
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:54,440
My calling takes me far from home, where shared struggles form fast bonds.

2024
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:56,780
My greatest advantage?

2025
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,620
Adaptability.

2026
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,020
Their greatest weakness.

2027
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:01,480
Me.

2028
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,700
My story.

2029
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,660
My story.

2030
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:09,600
My story is yours.

2031
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,160
Toki, don't disrespect your elders.

2032
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,020
I just don't play MMOs, guys.

2033
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,200
I...

2034
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,580
I'm just not an MMO player.

2035
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:25,280
I hear MMO, but I'm like...

2036
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,700
Oh, is this MapleStory?

2037
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:29,980
Oh wait, is this Genshin?

2038
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,060
Oh, it's Star...

2039
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,380
I went through so many different games.

2040
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,100
Sorry, I just realized the game title is literally right there.

2041
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,340
Star Dive.

2042
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:45,880
Yeah.

2043
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,260
One of them will eventually be Genshin, right?

2044
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,020
Okay.

2045
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:52,340
You can't lie.

2046
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:54,540
This reminded me of...

2047
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:56,080
This sort of looks like Genshin.

2048
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,840
Okay, there's Wuwa.

2049
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:11,680
Look though!

2050
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,360
Oh my god, look!

2051
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:12,980
There's Genshin!

2052
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,740
I knew it!

2053
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,640
Eventually, Genshin will show up.

2054
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,320
I fucking knew it.

2055
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,060
Guys, I was right.

2056
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,640
Genshin will show up.

2057
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,620
I did it.

2058
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,900
Oh shit, Marvel Rivals.

2059
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:29,380
Let's go.

2060
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:39,490
Wait, Marvel Rivals is on the Epic Store?

2061
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:40,910
Really?

2062
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:43,750
I guess cause like...

2063
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:46,210
It's also a separate launcher in the end.

2064
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:48,850
No, this is for Epic.

2065
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:49,770
Oh?

2066
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,700
Oh yeah, Cyberpunk is on Nintendo Switch too.

2067
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:58,780
Yeah.

2068
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:01,800
Everyone...

2069
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:04,400
That one guy was thinking it was Silksong.

2070
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:08,700
I bet you that one guy freaked out cause he thought it was about Silksong.

2071
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:17,900
Enter a surreal world where you're a down-as-locked outcast who has to battle his inner demons, literally, in this action roguelike.

2072
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,420
He is into the unwell.

2073
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:27,750
You heard that guy cheer?

2074
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:28,590
He was like, Oh!

2075
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,860
Oh, what the fuck is this?

2076
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,060
Has Summer...

2077
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:39,120
Was Summer Game Fest always this fucking long?

2078
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,120
I feel like there's been like more...

2079
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,700
I feel like there's been a lot of trailers this year.

2080
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,480
Yeah, this...

2081
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,260
This one is...

2082
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:57,680
A lot longer.

2083
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,940
The 3D with the...

2084
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:02,860
Uh...

2085
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:06,720
With the old timey animation does not work well for me.

2086
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:08,660
I don't know.

2087
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:12,720
If you're gonna do old timey animation style...

2088
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:14,600
I don't...

2089
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:16,060
3D just doesn't work with it.

2090
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:19,100
I don't like the 3D.

2091
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:37,810
And it looks...

2092
01:47:37,810 --> 01:47:40,190
Yeah, it does look unique, but...

2093
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:42,930
For me, there's something off.

2094
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:44,930
You still look a little...

2095
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:48,010
Into the unwell.

2096
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,170
There's just something off about it.

2097
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:53,330
Mixing the two art styles together.

2098
01:47:56,830 --> 01:47:58,230
But that's just my opinion.

2099
01:47:58,730 --> 01:47:59,730
Oh, Splitgate 2!

2100
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,270
Oh, Splitgate 2!

2101
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:07,010
When we started Splitgate in our dorm room, we just wanted to make a game we could play with our friends.

2102
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:09,090
And 20 million of you played with us.

2103
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:12,230
Now, with the help from our amazing community...

2104
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:12,470
Wait, they made Splitgate 1?

2105
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:13,850
With like...

2106
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:14,670
In the dorm room?

2107
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,450
It was like that...

2108
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:16,250
Because I grew up playing Halo.

2109
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:19,750
And I'm tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year.

2110
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:22,690
And I wish we could have Titanfall 3.

2111
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:23,690
Whoa!

2112
01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:26,310
Is he allowed to say that?

2113
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:26,870
Jeff?

2114
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:28,070
Is this scripted?

2115
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:29,890
Is he allowed to say that?

2116
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:34,090
What if you could portal to entirely different worlds?

2117
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:36,050
Whoa!

2118
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:36,850
Whoa!

2119
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:40,870
Jeff, are you sure he could say that?

2120
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:45,310
He got his microphone down!

2121
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,070
And it's fucking awesome!

2122
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:48,490
Whoa!

2123
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:50,950
Oh my god!

2124
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:52,210
Jeff!

2125
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:53,050
The Advertisers!

2126
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:54,490
Jeff!

2127
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:55,170
The Ad...

2128
01:48:57,550 --> 01:48:59,250
Jeff must have been like...

2129
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,090
Oh no!

2130
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:05,490
Holy shit!

2131
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:08,970
I don't know if that was scripted or not, guys!

2132
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:10,130
He gets the kill!

2133
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,870
Now that's how you portal!

2134
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:13,110
He he he he he!

2135
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:18,730
Oh, nice!

2136
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:19,730
Okay, that's cool.

2137
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:23,710
I never got a chance to play Splitgate because we never got pervs for it when it came up.

2138
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:26,350
I wanna play it.

2139
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,510
And then by the time...

2140
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:30,790
By the time I could finally try it up, people were just too good.

2141
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,670
There's no way.

2142
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,490
I don't know.

2143
01:49:35,650 --> 01:49:36,770
I feel like Jeff would not.

2144
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:37,790
Like...

2145
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:42,670
You know, like, I'm tired of how shitty Call of Duty is.

2146
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:46,070
And where the fuck is Titanfall 3 respawn?

2147
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:47,790
In like, a global...

2148
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:49,890
Like, in a...

2149
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:50,970
You know...

2150
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:54,410
It's just...

2151
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:58,730
I don't know if Jeff would actually be allowed that.

2152
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,160
Where is the line though?

2153
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:11,480
Yeah.

2154
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,380
Yeah, but you're not supposed to say that!

2155
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:16,980
In front of, like, a developer!

2156
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:20,440
In front of all these big developers!

2157
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,000
Like...

2158
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,320
Jeff is like, thinking...

2159
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:31,120
What do we do with this game?

2160
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,980
From the talented minds of RGG Studio in Japan.

2161
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:35,000
Ooh!

2162
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:44,050
He's been removed.

2163
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:48,310
What's this?

2164
01:50:52,830 --> 01:50:54,350
Is this Yakuza?

2165
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,120
Detective Yakuza?

2166
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:05,860
Yakuza, but like, the police?

2167
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:22,100
1943.

2168
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,720
Wait...

2169
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,820
1943 Yakuza?

2170
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,580
Wait, it is Detective Yakuza.

2171
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,320
Oh!

2172
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,780
It's like LA Noire!

2173
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:37,820
But like...

2174
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:38,980
Japan Noire!

2175
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,440
Oh shit!

2176
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:56,350
Yeah, it looks really good!

2177
01:51:58,050 --> 01:51:59,130
Yeah, that's cool!

2178
01:52:00,210 --> 01:52:01,430
That's really, really good.

2179
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:04,450
And then like, uh...

2180
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:04,990
What's his name?

2181
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:06,610
The eyepatch guy shows up here.

2182
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:09,430
Wait, it is...

2183
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:11,550
Wait, he looks like LA Noire.

2184
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:13,310
Majima.

2185
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:14,910
Yeah, Majima shows up.

2186
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,620
Project Sentry.

2187
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,440
Oh my god.

2188
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,460
Stranger Than Heaven.

2189
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,480
Oh, it's new IP!

2190
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:35,940
That looks really interesting.

2191
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,420
Yeah, Majima just comes up, and she's like, JK, it's Yakuza.

2192
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,900
You saw it at TJ last year.

2193
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:46,320
Project Sentry set in 1915, and now the full name has been revealed.

2194
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,800
Stranger Than Heaven, the brand new title.

2195
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:48,900
That looks interesting.

2196
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:50,200
From RGG Studio.

2197
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:56,580
This time, it's now 1943, and knowing RGG, I'm sure more surprises are surely on their way.

2198
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:05,380
All right, well, we're almost done here, but we do have one final, very special global game announcement to share with all of you.

2199
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:08,380
Oh, it's a global game announcement, guys.

2200
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:11,960
Projects from teams around the world, including many brand new studios, were proud of that.

2201
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:14,340
Guys, it says global game announcement.

2202
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,480
SilkSong has already been announced.

2203
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:20,160
It is no stranger to delivering blockbuster games time and again.

2204
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,040
SilkSong is global!

2205
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:31,060
I was absolutely blown away by the scale, scope, and ambition of this developer's vision.

2206
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:38,120
While there are many places, really any place, this game could have been revealed, we are so deeply honored.

2207
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:42,620
that we get to share it with the world right here, at Summer Game Fest.

2208
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:48,180
Guys, guys, you think this is SilkSong?

2209
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:58,980
Guys, do you think this is SilkSong?

2210
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:08,360
Guys, look, when he said global announcement, I was like, guys, SilkSong has already been announced.

2211
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:11,320
I don't think it's SilkSong.

2212
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,560
SilkSong remastered.

2213
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:19,660
Alternate universe SilkSong where they're all, what if they're like working in an office?

2214
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:20,800
Is that it?

2215
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,420
What if they're all just working in the office in this alternate universe?

2216
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,280
SilkSong on Unreal Engine.

2217
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,280
Hushed complain, yikes.

2218
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,160
Please, we have to go.

2219
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:46,700
Guys, remember Deadpool killed off SilkSong we could have had it?

2220
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:48,940
And it was Deadpool killed off SilkSong.

2221
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:51,000
We could have d-d-d it was Deadpool killed off SilkSong to announce a fucking BR game.

2222
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:58,580
If this is about the report you asked for yesterday, it'll be ready in three.

2223
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,240
No, no, two days, tops.

2224
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,600
Put a hold on that for now.

2225
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:03,960
We found another body.

2226
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:07,900
One that exhibits the same pathology as the others we've been investigating.

2227
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:10,600
Dookie, stop dragging the joke into the mug.

2228
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:14,440
That sounds like a fan that's so tired of waiting for Celsock.

2229
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:17,840
He's so tired.

2230
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:24,760
The Renwood Hotel.

2231
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,180
Oh.

2232
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:30,360
I know.

2233
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:32,240
That's where your mother was murdered.

2234
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:34,960
What the fuck?

2235
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,680
Alyssa died eight years ago.

2236
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,140
Perhaps it's time for you to face the past.

2237
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:42,740
Is this Evil Within?

2238
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:46,580
Grace.

2239
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:56,280
But they said it was a small dev team?

2240
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:00,600
Or not a small dev team, but, like, not, like, a well-known dev team.

2241
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,680
No, it's not Resident Evil, because they said just wait.

2242
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,540
Wait and we'll announce it one day.

2243
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,360
Oh, this is the one that I've been searching for.

2244
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,020
The special one.

2245
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,520
The chosen one.

2246
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,740
Miss Ashcroft.

2247
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:32,830
Oh, this is a new IP.

2248
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:34,950
We need to keep our voices down.

2249
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:36,930
Have you seen the same shit I've seen?

2250
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:42,370
Please know that you are my hope.

2251
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:44,670
Everyone's gone.

2252
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,380
Wait.

2253
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,120
What?

2254
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:55,280
Wait!

2255
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:55,800
Wait!

2256
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:59,400
Is this Resident Evil?

2257
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:02,920
Re...

2258
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:03,520
Oh!

2259
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:27,330
They were, like, the small studio.

2260
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:31,030
We'll also be hosting opening night live on Tuesday, August 19th.

2261
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:34,950
These fuckers were, like, this small studio.

2262
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:38,250
I can't believe they chose us.

2263
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:40,310
It's just about survival horror.

2264
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:49,490
Expect high-stakes cinematic action, too, with much more to share soon, leading up to its launch on February 27th, 2026.

2265
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:50,390
Holy shit!

2266
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:51,490
That's so soon!

2267
01:57:52,110 --> 01:57:53,190
That's half a year!

2268
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:54,730
That was an amazing announcement.

2269
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:55,810
Oh, my God!

2270
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:58,910
The small dev team known as Capcom.

2271
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:02,170
Let's thank our co-host, Lucy James.

2272
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:02,950
Didn't you do a great job, everyone?

2273
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:03,610
I'd play Resident Evil.

2274
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:06,130
Resident Evil's not as scary as Silent Hill.

2275
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:08,930
Resident Evil is more a shooty-shooty.

2276
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:09,890
I can't believe it for the first time.

2277
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:10,290
I know!

2278
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:11,530
I can't believe it!

2279
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:13,230
They're like, we don't need you, Bible!

2280
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:16,690
All right, well, there's much more Summer Game Fest to come.

2281
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:20,970
Make sure to visit SummerGameFest.com to see a listing of all the digital events this weekend.

2282
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:25,770
You can watch and highlight even more games, including the Xbox Game Showcase on Sunday.

2283
01:58:25,930 --> 01:58:32,450
And stay tuned online to see coverage of many of the playable games at Summer Game Fest Play Days that's taking place this weekend in L.A.

2284
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:40,430
And make sure to stay tuned for Day of the Devs, which is coming up next with additional new reveals from incredible independent studios around the world.

2285
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:42,990
I can't believe they baited us three times.

2286
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:45,870
They're like, we'll have the announcement soon.

2287
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:48,030
I just hope we can wait a little longer.

2288
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:53,750
And then they're like, JK, by waiting a little longer, I mean, wait 30 minutes.

2289
01:58:54,450 --> 01:58:56,130
I can't believe it!

2290
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:59,470
They actually baited us.

2291
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:02,570
Soon is now.

2292
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:04,590
Like, what the fuck?

2293
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:07,030
I did not expect that at all.

2294
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:07,650
Yeah.

2295
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:10,970
Holy fuck.

2296
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:14,830
And then when he was like, small in the dev team.

2297
01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:18,310
Like, of course I didn't expect...

2298
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:18,970
Oh, shit.

2299
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:20,550
What the fuck?

2300
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:21,350
That was loud.

2301
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:21,790
Sorry.

2302
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:22,610
Sorry.

2303
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,290
What the fuck?

2304
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:26,630
Holy shit.

2305
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:27,670
Okay, ouch.

2306
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,470
Yeah.

2307
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:30,150
That...

2308
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:30,750
Yeah, no.

2309
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:31,910
What the fuck?

2310
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,310
Okay.

2311
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:33,870
I don't know.

2312
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:34,570
Okay, sorry.

2313
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:37,170
That was from the stream itself.

2314
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:39,470
Everyone was freaking out and being like, what the fuck?

2315
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:40,510
Why was it so loud?

2316
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:41,030
Yeah.

2317
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:44,070
I know.

2318
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:44,850
I know.

2319
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:46,650
I was like, holy fuck instantly.

2320
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:52,030
Yeah, everyone in the Twitch chat, in the actual episode podcast, was like, what the fuck?

2321
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:57,910
Um, um, but yeah, like, they actually baited us.

2322
01:59:58,010 --> 02:00:00,790
I can't believe that was the, oh my God.

2323
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:03,750
Even Jeff was like, small in the dev team.

2324
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:05,390
And I was just like, wow, okay.

2325
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:07,610
What, what game would it be then?

2326
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:08,150
Like,

2327
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:13,650
oh my God.

2328
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:27,610
But yeah, for those of you wondering why I never played, I talked about this before a long time ago, but I know, like, I remember I even said it before in the past, but like, the reason why I couldn't stream Resident Evil games was because you need a Japanese copy to play the game because it would,

2329
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:34,490
um, because it had the censored version of, because it's censored in Japan with like, the blood splatters and everything.

2330
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:38,290
So I was never able to actually play Resident Evil because of it.

2331
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:40,990
Because, um, other people were able to stream it back then.

2332
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:45,490
The ones who were able to stream it literally had the Japanese copy of the game.

2333
02:00:45,650 --> 02:00:49,890
Like, they had a Japanese account, Steam account, so they could buy the JP.

2334
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:53,590
So we weren't allowed to stream back then when I had to get perms and stuff.

2335
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:57,730
We weren't allowed to, like, stream the game Unless it's the Japanese copy.

2336
02:00:57,890 --> 02:00:59,710
Because we can't play the NA copy.

2337
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:02,050
Because it didn't have the right censorship or anything.

2338
02:01:02,430 --> 02:01:04,810
Like the blood censors and stuff.

2339
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:08,650
Because it's less gory in the JP version for Resident Evil.

2340
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:10,410
So, yeah.

2341
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:11,670
I explained that before.

2342
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:15,450
Because I remember you guys in the past were like, Oh, why don't you stream the Resident Evil games?

2343
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:16,690
And I was like, I can't.

2344
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:18,610
I have an NA Steam account.

2345
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:21,650
I don't have a JP account.

2346
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:23,550
But now I can.

2347
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:24,230
Now I can.

2348
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:27,410
I've always wanted to play the newer Resident Evil games.

2349
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:29,130
I don't know about...

2350
02:01:29,790 --> 02:01:35,130
The reason why I never played Village or the other Resident Evil 7 or 8.

2351
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:38,370
Was because I watched so much gameplay of 7 and 8.

2352
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:41,810
That I just feel like it's not special to me.

2353
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:45,510
Because I really, really liked Resident Evil the franchise.

2354
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:49,390
And because of that, I watched so much of the gameplay.

2355
02:01:49,570 --> 02:01:53,570
And I don't like playing a game where I've already watched the gameplay of already.

2356
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:55,630
And, like, know what's going on.

2357
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:58,490
And know, like, everything about the lore.

2358
02:01:59,370 --> 02:02:00,110
And everything.

2359
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:04,490
So, I already got so much exposure to the game itself.

2360
02:02:04,730 --> 02:02:06,610
That's why I never actually streamed it now.

2361
02:02:06,670 --> 02:02:08,070
But I wanted to stream it on launch.

2362
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:09,210
When it first launched.

2363
02:02:09,370 --> 02:02:11,710
And, like, when I had less exposure.

2364
02:02:12,010 --> 02:02:14,330
But when I found out back then when I couldn't stream it.

2365
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:16,430
I just, like, read everything about it.

2366
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,370
Watched everything about the gameplay.

2367
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:20,710
So, like, it wasn't that special to me at that point.

2368
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:24,830
But, like, I would love to stream Resident Evil 9.

2369
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:26,030
I'm looking forward to it.

2370
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:28,150
It seems really, really, really fun.

2371
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:28,570
But, yeah.

2372
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:31,430
A lot of games I'm looking forward to.

2373
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:35,590
The Sonic Racing.

2374
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:39,230
The Sonic Racing game.

2375
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:41,430
I'm looking forward to that.

2376
02:02:42,010 --> 02:02:43,630
Resident Evil 9.

2377
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:46,650
That's, yeah.

2378
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:49,830
The Sonic Racing with Hatsune Miku.

2379
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:50,830
And Steve.

2380
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:52,230
What was the other one?

2381
02:02:52,330 --> 02:02:54,550
There was a second game where I was like, oh, my God.

2382
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:56,130
The Muppet Boxing.

2383
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:56,450
Yes.

2384
02:02:56,850 --> 02:02:57,070
Okay.

2385
02:02:57,150 --> 02:02:58,230
The Muppet Boxing.

2386
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,350
Sonic Racing.

2387
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:00,750
And Resident Evil 9.

2388
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:04,710
Those were the three games I was most looking for.

2389
02:03:04,930 --> 02:03:06,850
Oh, and the Souls-like game.

2390
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:08,270
The Chinese Souls-like game.

2391
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:11,230
But, like, that one wasn't a global announcement.

2392
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:13,090
So, I wasn't, like, you know, oh, yeah.

2393
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:14,850
Like, super...

2394
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:16,630
That one I already knew about it for a while.

2395
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:18,050
And also the new Onimusha.

2396
02:03:18,130 --> 02:03:19,710
Because they already announced those two games already.

2397
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:22,610
The other three games that were just...

2398
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:24,910
I meant the games that were just announced from there.

2399
02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:26,690
I already knew about the Onimusha game.

2400
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:30,630
And I already knew about the Chinese Souls-like game for a while.

2401
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:38,050
So, like, I'm looking forward to those two games, but they're not like... I'm looking forward to those two games as well, but it's not like, oh, they're new, that I just found out about it.

2402
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:40,210
But yeah, that was really fun.

2403
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:41,990
Really long showcase.

2404
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:44,790
I feel like they were never this long before.

2405
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:46,610
Was that me?

2406
02:03:46,910 --> 02:03:48,630
This seems really, really long.

2407
02:03:48,810 --> 02:03:51,190
I was not expecting how long it was.

2408
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:51,670
Yeah.

2409
02:03:53,670 --> 02:04:00,830
Like, I feel like usually it's like an hour or an hour and a half, but two hours... it was a two-hour show.

2410
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:03,870
This year was a lot.

2411
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:11,390
But I felt like I didn't see a lot of trailers that I want to play.

2412
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:21,370
For me, there wasn't really a lot of trailers where I was like, oh, yeah, I want to play that.

2413
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:23,630
It was a long, long one.

2414
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:29,010
I did get a little bored midway because it felt like it did drag on a little bit.

2415
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:31,110
But there were some good announcements.

2416
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:34,010
I always love doing these watch-alongs with you guys to see what the new games are.

2417
02:04:34,810 --> 02:04:36,050
But thank y'all for coming.

2418
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:46,130
I do have another stream later tonight in an hour because I didn't think I was going to, you know, I thought I had more break in between, but this was a two-hour showcase.

2419
02:04:46,730 --> 02:04:48,610
But I have another stream later in an hour on YouTube.

2420
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:50,770
For those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

2421
02:04:50,770 --> 02:04:57,770
My mic sounds weird because I'm traveling right now, but I'll be back tomorrow with my usual setup, so everything's going to be good from there.

2422
02:04:58,850 --> 02:05:00,370
But please check me out on YouTube.

2423
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:01,630
If you want to see me on other...

2424
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:04,610
If you want to know whenever I stream on Twitch, check me out on Twitter.

2425
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:08,650
Follow me there, exclamation point Twitter, exclamation point social media, exclamation point YouTube.

2426
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:10,930
Check me over all those platforms.

2427
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:13,230
If you want to support me via other means, I do have my merch.

2428
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:19,530
I have my merch, I have my Hyatt cases, custom PC cases, and I have my gamer subcode.

2429
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:21,190
So there's another way to check me out there.

2430
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:25,930
And also, thank you again for all the bitties, for all the support, for all the follows, for all the raids.

2431
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:26,930
I really appreciate it.

2432
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:28,850
I appreciate watching this with you guys.

2433
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:30,430
It's always fun seeing the new stuff.

2434
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:32,130
Hey guys, I'm going to head off now.

2435
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:35,670
There's no raids because I have one monitor, so I really don't want to...

2436
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:41,470
Like, I always... I want to be careful with where I'm going when I have one monitor, because I'm like only sharing one screen.

2437
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:42,150
Oh...

2438
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:44,830
So there won't be a raid.

2439
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:46,530
You can just disperse wherever you want to go.

2440
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:51,110
But anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2441
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,970
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2442
02:05:54,070 --> 02:05:55,290
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2443
02:05:55,690 --> 02:05:56,390
Bye guys!

2444
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:57,190
Bye!
