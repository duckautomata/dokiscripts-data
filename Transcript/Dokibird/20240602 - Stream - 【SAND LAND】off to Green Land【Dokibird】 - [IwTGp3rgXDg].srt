00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,220
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,800
Welcome back to Sandland!

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,260
I think it's been like, what, two weeks since we played part two?

4
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,700
This is the worst thing I can do in my channel.

5
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,640
Uh, play- okay, here's a pro tip for you guys.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,440
Um, playing- doing a part three of a series two weeks later of a long- of a sort of RPG game is not the smartest thing you should do.

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,880
But, I don't care, cause I actually was enjoying Sandland, so...

8
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,960
But I don't care!

9
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,760
Because Sandland has been very enjoyable!

10
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:37,180
And like, even though it's been through- two weeks since we played part two, and a lot of you might have already forgotten what the fuck happened.

11
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,440
It's okay, we're starting a new story because apparently, um...

12
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,440
In part two, we finished the original story of Sandland.

13
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,500
And we were just about to start a new story where we're not in the sand anymore.

14
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,440
Uh, so there's that.

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,220
Also cause like, Bandai has been treating me really well.

16
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,420
Like the, uh, Bandai America and I guess like JP as well.

17
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,740
Um, they've been treating me really well.

18
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,200
And like, you know what, like, I honestly have been enjoying Sandland.

19
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,900
And I was like, uh, I'm gonna keep going.

20
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm gonna keep going, keep advertising Sandland for doing good.

21
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,540
For those who forgot about it.

22
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,440
Uh, cause I enjoy the game.

23
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,140
And I enjoy Bandai.

24
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,900
Um, but yes!

25
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,140
Let's go!

26
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,340
Alright, Sandland.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,100
Guys, like I said, you actually don't have to know about what happened last time.

28
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Because we're starting a whole new fucking story.

29
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Uh, thank you for the- uh, gift the chip, Deadpool!

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,720
Thank you, thank you!

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,720
I really appreciate it.

32
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,380
Oh, why is my controller not working?

33
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,400
No!

34
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,340
Did it register my fucking mouse?

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,540
Okay, I hope I don't get, uh, marked for demonetization for saying the F word.

36
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Alright guys, I need to reboot the game.

37
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,440
Cause I have to- I had to boot it up while I was on a controller.

38
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,680
Give me a sec.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Give me a sec.

40
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,100
Alright, we're starting a new season.

41
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,240
A new season of sand.

42
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,880
Where it's green now.

43
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,300
Uh...

44
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,440
Also, like, uh, just want you guys to know.

45
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,920
Next week will be, quote unquote, wet rest week.

46
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,700
Other than, like, I think I have that Twitch Rivals thing.

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,540
Wait, it's actually not registering.

48
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,040
Excuse you.

49
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,540
Excuse me?

50
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Hello?

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,340
Okay, maybe if I click continue, it'll register.

52
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,360
Hello?

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,600
Hello?

54
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,700
Say!

55
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,260
Okay, maybe if I, like, press escape.

56
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,900
And go to- Oh!

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:49,960
Alright!

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,160
Let's go!

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
Control setup.

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,080
There we go.

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, control type.

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Yes!

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Yes!

64
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,620
Control type!

65
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,960
Oh!

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright.

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,200
My- I'm sorry.

68
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,040
Okay, I have an idea.

69
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,400
I have an idea on how to fix this.

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,240
Okay.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,520
Uh, controller settings.

72
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,460
Yes!

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,580
Yes!

74
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,040
Okay.

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,560
Does that mean it's gonna...

76
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,320
configure it now?

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,560
Does that...

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,760
It says...

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,020
controller's activated.

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,940
How did I- How did I do this?

81
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
How did I-

82
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,200
Was I playing a controller last time?

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,020
Oh, I did it!

84
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,420
I did it!

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
I had to replug it!

86
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,520
Oh my gosh.

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,840
I knew it.

88
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,880
When all else fails, just...

89
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
plug in it- turn it on and off again.

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,000
Alright.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,100
Oh, hey, there was a monkey.

92
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,360
Guys, I don't remember how to play this game.

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,620
Uh, what was the object- Oh, I have to talk- Oh, I have to talk to the- talk to people!

94
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes, there we go.

95
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,040
Oh my gosh, is Tenjin here?

96
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay, I need to moderate Tenjin.

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,820
Hey, Tenjin.

98
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,720
Oh, shit!

99
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,840
Tenjin's a member!

100
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,380
Oh my god!

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Alright.

102
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,740
Nice.

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,360
You're just a standard moderator.

104
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,820
You don't have that much power on my channel.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,340
Oh my- Tenjin!

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,780
You fake-ass fan!

107
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:09,980
You're a fake-ass fan!

108
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,140
You said you were always a member!

109
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,500
What the fuck happened?

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,960
You're a tomato!

111
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,560
That's like the first membership!

112
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,500
If you were always a member, you would have been an egg right now.

113
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,840
Thank you for joining the tomato farm, Tenjin.

114
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,200
I hope you had a great debut.

115
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,380
I was sleeping, so I couldn't retweet it in time.

116
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
I was- I was tired.

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,700
Is that what he thinks?

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,520
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,200
Let's bring them more supplies later and see if they can fix my console.

121
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Sounds like a plan.

122
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,240
Oh my god.

123
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,220
Congratulations on your debut, Tenjin.

124
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,160
You should- You know what?

125
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,560
But you didn't gorilla stream it.

126
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,260
You said the moment everything's ready, you would make a waiting room and turn your stream on.

127
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,740
You really lied to me.

128
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,780
Master drop, thank you for the fish!

129
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:09,940
I'm so happy!

130
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,140
Thank you, thank you!

131
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,680
Get the chips!

132
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,840
Thank you, thank you!

133
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Us too?

134
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,340
What do you mean?

135
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,460
We've lost contact with the unit tasked to guard the battleship.

136
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,220
And when we dispatched another nearby unit to investigate, they were in AWOL 2.

137
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,260
Fake and real friends.

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,160
Real G.

139
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,520
So now you want the old man to look into it for you?

140
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,500
The Elzebub.

141
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,280
I didn't realize you were there.

142
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,560
Wait, someone stole our ships?

143
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,920
It's not a ship.

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,440
No!

145
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,020
You never know where I might show up.

146
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,460
The taxpayer's money!

147
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,620
The battleship belonged to Zeyu.

148
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,580
Check out Tenjin.

149
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,280
He just recently debuted, guys.

150
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,520
He has a new skin suit now.

151
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,140
Something about his chin?

152
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,560
I saw...

153
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,580
Tenjin, why was everybody talking about your chin?

154
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,460
I didn't watch your debut yet.

155
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,500
I'm confused.

156
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,920
Would you like to explain if you're still here?

157
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,130
Tenjin, what's going on?

158
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,670
Oh, Tenjin.

159
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,910
Why are people calling you Tenjin?

160
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,630
Well, you heard the brief.

161
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,090
Are you two coming along?

162
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,690
Sure.

163
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,850
Sounds fun.

164
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,770
Thanks.

165
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,090
I just hope we don't run into anything too crazy.

166
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,070
Having Mountain of the Chin.

167
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,050
What is it?

168
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,370
Going up?

169
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,230
But like... that game.

170
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,410
But on Tenjin's chin.

171
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,130
Tenjin's chin.

172
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,710
Yeah.

173
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,670
Zeyu's battleship crash landed somewhere around the big dam.

174
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,210
Is that where the peach is?

175
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,230
Yes.

176
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,310
How do I...

177
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,350
The Royal Army.

178
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,370
Okay.

179
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:52,950
Oh, there we go.

180
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,390
I need to grab the tank.

181
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,890
Because it's fast.

182
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,990
Wait, no.

183
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,730
I need to get a motorcycle because it's faster.

184
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,190
The others can walk.

185
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:01,730
In fact, we don't know.

186
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,430
Maybe their transmitter just malfunctioned.

187
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,750
Well, I certainly hope so.

188
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,150
All right.

189
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,210
Off I go.

190
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,130
It's alright.

191
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,530
I don't really care about the others.

192
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,690
They can just walk.

193
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,870
Wait, do I fast travel?

194
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,450
Where is it?

195
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,470
Oh, no.

196
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,530
It's too far.

197
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,290
The fast travel is not...

198
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,970
Wait, unless...

199
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,570
Is this...

200
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,270
No.

201
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,730
I don't have the fast travel for this.

202
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,490
Guys, I found out.

203
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,770
So apparently...

204
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,790
By the way, guys.

205
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,890
Apparently...

206
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,150
What the fuck?

207
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,850
There's a crocodile now in this game?

208
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,850
Wow!

209
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,750
Okay.

210
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,210
I was so busy looking at the crocodile.

211
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,190
It almost fell off.

212
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:46,810
Okay.

213
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,110
What was I going to say?

214
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,490
Oh, yeah.

215
00:09:49,550 --> 00:10:00,130
Apparently, if I had done the side quest, I could have decorated my base and everything and also put stickers and changed the colors of my tanks.

216
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,310
So like...

217
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:01,650
Oops.

218
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,790
All right.

219
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,230
Well, oopsie.

220
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,850
Apparently, you know, I didn't...

221
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,830
I had a bad day.

222
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,470
I didn't unlock any of the actual fun parts of this...

223
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:23,110
Like the actual fun parts of customization of this game just because I've been ignoring all these side quests.

224
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,070
Oopsie.

225
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,770
So you know that 50 chairs I got?

226
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,610
The 50 chairs I got from the...

227
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,670
From pre-ordering?

228
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,090
Yeah.

229
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,290
I still own 50 chairs.

230
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,810
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,050
Oh, good.

232
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,810
Also...

233
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,030
Oh.

234
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,170
She got the visor fake thing.

235
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,770
You didn't...

236
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,590
Yeah, I was not sure why I wanted to go tochaft.

237
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,050
Oh, my gosh.

238
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,490
These guys are like the complete twits.

239
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,610
Shouldn't be.

240
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,470
Oh, I thought my cards were set.

241
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,470
With the flower pot.

242
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,210
Well...

243
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,390
That is...

244
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,750
That is like...

245
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,990
Yeah...

246
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,790
Wow.

247
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,530
We're almost there.

248
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,190
Yeah, we're almost here.

249
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,030
No, it's not my fault.

250
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,830
You just didn't yell hard enough at me.

251
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,210
If you yell hard enough at me, then I couldn't choose to not see because I'll be like, Whoa!

252
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,330
There's way too many people saying that.

253
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,370
So how can I choose to ignore it if it's harder to ignore?

254
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,870
You get me?

255
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,090
You understand?

256
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,370
Oh yeah, you're a social super chat.

257
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,450
There are only a few, sure.

258
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,390
But with large groups, you risk getting surrounded.

259
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:46,870
Alright.

260
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,630
Let's see.

261
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,810
Where do I go?

262
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,190
Is this where we go to Greenland?

263
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,570
Oh my god, this guy's dead.

264
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,270
Oh no, he's dead!

265
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,870
I wish you could have ran him over.

266
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,030
Baddai, you're hearing this?

267
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,270
That would have been so- Baddai, I actually don't hear this.

268
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,390
Baddai, I- Please don't take my advice.

269
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,050
You okay?

270
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,710
What the heck just happened?

271
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,610
Some group I've never seen before suddenly attacked me.

272
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,770
Zeon, thank you for the super chat.

273
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,110
Thank you.

274
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,710
Hello chat, is I a dragoon who has plaz this game?

275
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,450
Dokis Town has no features because she skipped every side quest.

276
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,850
Thank you for the super chat.

277
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,310
Thank you.

278
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,910
Thank you.

279
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,350
Not on purpose!

280
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,710
It was not willingly skipped, okay?

281
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,250
They just didn't put it in my face hard enough.

282
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,990
More like passed out.

283
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,070
Who could defeat elite royal army soldiers in an instant?

284
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,630
Yeah, who could do that?

285
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,930
Wait, can I still unlock it?

286
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,270
Or did I like leave my home already?

287
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,450
Guys, it doesn't mean- Guys!

288
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,410
It doesn't mean that I can't unlock it!

289
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,650
Alright, what- Okay guys, you know what?

290
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,130
Fuck you guys.

291
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,570
Okay, I'm gonna do this out of spite now.

292
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,950
We're not going to Greenland anymore!

293
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,730
We could have been in Greenland already, but we're not going to Greenland anymore!

294
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,210
We're gonna- We're gonna unlock features!

295
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,670
Where- Where is our home?

296
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,690
We demand green.

297
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,430
Guys, I'm having trouble finding Greenland, like our home.

298
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,730
Oh, it's here.

299
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,470
That should be it.

300
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,050
Why can't I fucking fast travel?

301
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,410
Fast travel to this.

302
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,370
Oh, I have to like zoom in, I guess.

303
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,490
It has to be this.

304
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,350
Yeah.

305
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:46,490
No?

306
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,470
Wait, this is not my home.

307
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,710
Guys, give me a sec.

308
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,330
I'm trying to remember where we used to live.

309
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,650
This is- No, this is the nest.

310
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,850
Guys, where did we live?

311
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,830
That's the ruins.

312
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,390
That's the- Espino?

313
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,210
Guys, I don't even know where we lived.

314
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,470
Guys.

315
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,430
That's deemed space.

316
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,750
Talbot?

317
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,350
Nests?

318
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,370
Water Supply?

319
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,550
Where's my house?

320
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,310
Oh, Espino, there you are!

321
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,290
Are you gonna pick up Fallout 4 again?

322
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,390
Young Thank you for Super Chat!

323
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,210
thank- thank you!

324
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,910
I'm going to see after, uh after Sandland.

325
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,510
We'll see.

326
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,590
Thank you for Super Chat, Young.

327
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,390
Thank- thank you.

328
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,010
S Ankermit, thank you much.

329
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,830
Why did you get the ships?

330
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,670
Thank you, thank you.

331
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,870
Okay, what was the first side quest, guys?

332
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,970
Come on.

333
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,210
There's not even any side quests!

334
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,950
Here.

335
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,210
There's nobody offering side quests.

336
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,110
Golden help, thank you for the super chat.

337
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,110
Thank you, thank you.

338
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,390
Stop complaining, I swear to God.

339
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,490
We are turning this car around and doing the side quest chat.

340
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,530
We don't... then why are you complaining?

341
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,370
You guys don't even know which one were the side quests!

342
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,470
Alright, go to the quest menu.

343
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,690
You guys didn't even know.

344
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,470
Oh, whoa!

345
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,330
Okay, guys.

346
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,050
This is awkward because they still have not yet fixed this.

347
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,430
That's the guy that plotted it.

348
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,890
How do I... how do I improve my home that I'm gonna leave anyway?

349
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:40,970
Guys!

350
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,890
Guys that plotted this!

351
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,330
You said... you said there were side quests I should be doing.

352
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,130
Where is it?

353
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,070
Thank you for the super chat.

354
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,650
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,430
Got the email that I received a gift of membership.

356
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:56,930
Thanks.

357
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,910
Oh, hi Doki.

358
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,670
This guy's only here for the chat.

359
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,310
The dragoons were the main show for Gavilan.

360
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,290
Doki was the bonus.

361
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:10,870
Suspicious...

362
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,550
Yeah, but which one is the one that would unlock stuff?

363
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,550
Guys, you can't just be like, go look at the yellows.

364
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,930
Not every yellow is a fucking side quest I should be doing.

365
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,970
And this... and this five.

366
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,970
Thank you for the super chat.

367
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,810
Thank you, thank you.

368
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,630
Have you forgotten?

369
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,050
Dragoons argue with each other as much as we complain.

370
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,190
Thank you.

371
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,690
Thank you for the super chat.

372
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,530
Thank you, thank you.

373
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:35,870
Guys!

374
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:44,090
Like, not every side quest here indicates the one that will give me the...

375
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,510
That will give me free shit.

376
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:49,850
Okay.

377
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,790
Uh...

378
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,190
Cosmogdon, thank you for the super chat.

379
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,010
Thank you, thank you.

380
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,850
Improve your home with putting green.

381
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,390
Yeah, I guess it could be the suspicious cave?

382
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,430
Okay, I'm gonna go check out the suspicious cave.

383
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,410
That has to be it.

384
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,130
I swear to god.

385
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,990
If this doesn't give me what I want...

386
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,890
I swear to god, chat.

387
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,790
Ooh.

388
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,850
You don't wanna make Doki angry.

389
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,970
I'm practicing.

390
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,170
Let me put my white shirt on.

391
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,110
Okay.

392
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,070
Alright.

393
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,670
Um...

394
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,030
Let's see.

395
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,270
I'm gonna head this way.

396
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:33,970
Uh...

397
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,550
This is one of them.

398
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,150
Alright.

399
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,510
Let's hope this is one of them.

400
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,430
I really want to see Doki.

401
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,690
We should think about stopping by that campsite they're using ourselves.

402
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,830
It's a community.

403
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,210
Burrito, thank you for the super chat.

404
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:52,970
Thank you, thank you.

405
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,750
Think about it.

406
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,530
Life is just a series of side quests.

407
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,910
Let us live our life, Doki.

408
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,370
Thank you for the super chat.

409
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,250
Thank you, thank you.

410
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,190
Let's open the wall trap.

411
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,350
Alright, let's see.

412
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,910
$10 for chat, we deserve it.

413
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,370
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

414
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,050
Thank you, thank you.

415
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,990
Who the fuck are you?

416
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,210
Zeph?

417
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,810
Who are you?

418
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,610
Were you just created for just this quest?

419
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,330
Thank you for the 10 gifted shit.

420
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,030
Thank you, thank you.

421
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,410
Wait, I should learn to read your name.

422
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,770
Sorry, I can't read very well.

423
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,730
Especially like...

424
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,590
I can't read English very well.

425
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,670
So like any other language is also pretty bad for me.

426
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,650
So let me actually learn to read your name.

427
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,650
Because you've been supporting me a lot.

428
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,550
Alright.

429
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,810
Parupo.

430
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,250
I hope I pronounced it right.

431
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,670
Parupo, thank you for the...

432
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,070
Thank you for the 10 gifted shit.

433
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,970
Thank you, thank you.

434
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,430
That's me!

435
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,270
Yep!

436
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,870
Wait, I can actually do his voice.

437
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,570
Yep!

438
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,750
I'm the...

439
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,530
The Crown Prince of Beelzebub!

440
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,850
Am I close?

441
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:06,950
No.

442
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,970
Guys, you're supposed to be my fucking echo chamber.

443
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,270
So what if you're the Fiend Prince?

444
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,930
I'm a hunter.

445
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,350
What's the point of streaming if I have not created an echo chamber to say I'm right on everything?

446
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,030
And to get you dragged to the next target I plan on bagging.

447
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,950
A demon child's nothing in comparison.

448
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,410
You're hunting Gedji Dragons?

449
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,470
What's Gedji Dragons?

450
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,010
Are those the ones I've been running over?

451
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,190
Best drop that dud of a plan now.

452
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,450
Even I'm no match for that beast.

453
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,110
Ha!

454
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,250
Don't put you and me in the same basket.

455
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,210
I've compiled the Gedji Dragon Strategy Guide to bring it down.

456
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:54,450
Hm.

457
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,650
Sounds interesting.

458
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,350
Let me take a look at it.

459
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,130
Ooh!

460
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,250
That's the way to kill the Gedji Dragon.

461
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,730
If one really exists, I'm also interested.

462
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,350
Oh, that's the thing that chased me in the back?

463
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,850
Let's make them extinct!

464
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:08,810
Let's go!

465
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,390
Environment dis- what was it?

466
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,250
Environment terrorism?

467
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,250
You'll have to fetch it yourself.

468
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,030
Ecological terrorism?

469
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,470
Is that what it's called?

470
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,230
Like, making a fucking species extinct?

471
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,370
Bring it to me and I'll let you read it.

472
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,090
Heck, I'll even pay you.

473
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,810
I guess.

474
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,710
In game.

475
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,610
In game.

476
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,110
In game.

477
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,630
In game, guys.

478
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,990
Wait, what is that?

479
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,410
What's ecoterrorism, then?

480
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,370
Is that really bad?

481
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,070
I mean, I saw- Wait, actually, they're all really bad.

482
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,970
Oh, shit!

483
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:44,690
Sorry!

484
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,290
I didn't know what it actually meant.

485
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,370
Wait, let me look it up.

486
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,910
Oh my god.

487
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,970
Wait, what did I just say yay to?

488
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,310
Eco- Okay...

489
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:06,110
I thought that meant getting rid of- Oh, that's when you support the environment and you do bad things.

490
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,730
Oh!

491
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,670
Sorry, I'm here to do the opposite of that.

492
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,350
But like...

493
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,790
But to make things extinct.

494
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,170
Okay.

495
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,970
Yeah, we're not doing that.

496
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,690
It's the opposite of that.

497
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,150
Okay.

498
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,430
I learned something new today, guys.

499
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,910
Okay.

500
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,310
Guys, thank you for educating me.

501
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:36,890
Alright.

502
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,790
Guys.

503
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,690
Thank you for educating me, guys.

504
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,330
I got educated.

505
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,310
So, yay!

506
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,490
See?

507
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,830
This is a learning stream.

508
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,290
Guys, we're all learning together about what words mean.

509
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,370
Chat.

510
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,210
We're all learning.

511
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,950
Alright.

512
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,670
I hope Bandai is not watching me right now.

513
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,150
I'm sorry.

514
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,210
I know Bandai is not watching because like...

515
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,250
They are legally obligated to be like, Hi Doki if they're in my chat.

516
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,730
Yeah, Bandai!

517
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,410
Bandai!

518
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,310
Alright.

519
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,130
Let's see.

520
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,610
Where did I take this quote?

521
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,990
Oh, wait.

522
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,370
No, I...

523
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,550
Wait, I was supposed to still be there.

524
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,170
The cave is here.

525
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,190
Alright.

526
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,650
Alright.

527
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,690
How do I get into this suspicious cave?

528
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,230
Oh, there it is.

529
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,010
It has to be it.

530
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,830
Oh, nope.

531
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,510
Okay, get off this.

532
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,370
I need to change it to this.

533
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,730
Yeah, get off your fucking truck, old man.

534
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,170
Oh, okay.

535
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,810
Oh, wait.

536
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,250
Wait.

537
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,990
Platt guy!

538
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,090
Oh, shit!

539
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,710
Okay, wait.

540
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,350
Zia, thank you for the super chat.

541
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,650
Thank you.

542
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,050
Since Doki wants to be told exactly.

543
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,910
That's right.

544
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,610
That's me.

545
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:15,530
Desert soldier recruits Moss who will then give you the mysterious voice side quest in town.

546
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,690
Who the fuck is a desert soldier?

547
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,330
Oh, is this it?

548
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,490
Wait.

549
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,710
Oh, I'm not sure.

550
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,230
Wait, wait, wait.

551
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,170
Oh, there it is!

552
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,390
Okay, well, there's still gonna be a dragon problem.

553
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,550
Here, guys.

554
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,470
Oh, well.

555
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:33,970
Oh, my God.

556
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,190
Oh, well.

557
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,930
We don't care about that.

558
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,370
Sorry.

559
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,170
Sorry, man.

560
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,450
Your side quest was not as important.

561
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,430
This way.

562
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,870
Thank you for the super chat.

563
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,210
Thank you.

564
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,790
Thank you.

565
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,190
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

566
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:47,510
Thank you.

567
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,870
Thank you.

568
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,150
Doki wants to be the captain planet villain.

569
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,610
Thank you for the super chat.

570
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,010
Thank you.

571
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,530
Thank you.

572
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,690
You think about it.

573
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,770
The kids on Captain Planet, they're the bad guys.

574
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,390
They do extreme things.

575
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,190
What to do?

576
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,330
I'm in a bind.

577
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,230
Yes.

578
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,590
Oh.

579
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,730
Hello?

580
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,170
I hear mumbling.

581
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,470
Desert soldier!

582
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,170
Me!

583
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,590
Yes!

584
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,290
I'm busted!

585
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,270
This must be my end.

586
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,670
Yes!

587
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,730
What?

588
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,330
Why?

589
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,250
Oh, Shariko, thank you for the super chat.

590
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,570
No.

591
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,070
No, I am not.

592
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,610
I'm not.

593
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,550
Thank you for the super chat.

594
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:23,950
Thank you.

595
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:24,590
Thank you.

596
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,510
What are you going on about?

597
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,830
Wait.

598
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,830
You're not a wannabe junker.

599
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,330
Of course not.

600
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:33,930
Yeah.

601
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,070
I'm the fiend prince.

602
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,170
I'm the fiend prince Beelzebub.

603
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:37,830
Beelzebub.

604
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,470
You fiend!

605
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,150
Shaking in your boots, are you?

606
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,950
You're scary, yes.

607
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,150
Also, were you saying Captain Planet?

608
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,650
I'll take up the many one right now.

609
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,750
Even a fiend.

610
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,710
You can tell people who don't know what you're talking... like the age differences between the two.

611
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,450
I mean the people in my chat.

612
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,190
Please, save me, yes?

613
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,010
With the people who don't know who the fuck Captain Planet is and the people who do.

614
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,350
So like...

615
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,810
It like sort of dates you.

616
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,670
The only reason I know who Captain Planet is, is because of Rick and Morty.

617
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,710
So like that sort of like tells like...

618
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,250
How about we hear what he has to say?

619
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,550
I was not there to watch Captain Planet.

620
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,550
He's no dookie.

621
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,170
Hmm.

622
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm not a dookie.

623
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,790
Oh no, she's profiling us.

624
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,590
Okay guys, when did Captain Planet release?

625
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:40,090
Captain Planet... um... release year... 1990!

626
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,730
Oh my god!

627
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,850
I'm pretty sure they never made a sequel.

628
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,590
I've never heard anything...

629
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,450
Oh wait, the new adventures of Captain Planet.

630
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,570
When was this?

631
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,450
Oh no, that was also pretty old.

632
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,730
Dookie, stop!

633
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,890
Oh shit!

634
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:05,950
1990?

635
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,950
Oh, I knew it was old, but I didn't realize it was that old.

636
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,730
Alright.

637
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,490
Alright, let's see.

638
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,630
It's okay guys.

639
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,690
It's okay guys.

640
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,170
Don't...

641
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,970
That's why I'm streaming.

642
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,470
Okay.

643
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,230
Thank you, Super Chat.

644
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:32,910
Thank you.

645
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,290
Hey, Chat.

646
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,210
Y'all looking good today.

647
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,250
How have you been?

648
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,150
Playing any good games?

649
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,450
Doing anything fun this summer?

650
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,330
Stay cool, Chat.

651
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,270
Thank you, Super Chat.

652
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:39,910
Thank you.

653
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,730
Thank you.

654
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,330
Alright, here.

655
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,510
Thank you, Super Chat.

656
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:48,830
Thank you.

657
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,150
Thank you.

658
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:49,870
Okay, Grandma.

659
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,810
Dookie.

660
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,630
Dookie, thank you.

661
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,490
Thank you so much.

662
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,550
Thank you.

663
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,830
The Junkers?

664
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,590
What did you do?

665
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,130
Grinkle, thank you for the five good dishes!

666
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,470
Thank you!

667
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,130
Yeah, what did you do?

668
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:55,390
Oh my god, he's a good guy!

669
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,110
I plowed on in with my tank and drove them away, yes?

670
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:07,030
Oh, okay, I thought he meant he ran them over with his tank and I was like, maybe he's not that good of a guy!

671
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,410
I was like, whoa!

672
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,050
I don't know if a good guy would run people over with their cat tank.

673
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,250
Now I'm hiding away in here, yes?

674
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,070
But it won't be long before they find this old shack.

675
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,870
And when they do, I just know I'll be...

676
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,510
What will you be?

677
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,050
I shudder to even think of it.

678
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,500
Anything forbidden, huh?

679
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Thank you for the super chat, thank you!

680
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,260
If I like being old, I have old man power!

681
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,240
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

682
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,400
You get to have your own credit card and your own mortgage!

683
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,180
You know, it's good to be old because that means you can have credit cards.

684
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,980
And by having credit cards, you can super chat to your Oshii.

685
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,520
Yeah?

686
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,900
True.

687
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,580
Wink wink.

688
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,120
Aphelion, thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

689
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,100
Thank you, thank you!

690
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,440
It's my fault!

691
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,060
It's never my fault!

692
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,200
Alright, fine.

693
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm bold to assume I have good credit.

694
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,260
Ooh, the woes of being... What the fuck?

695
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,140
Where did these guys come from?

696
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,420
Oh, okay, these are the guys that...

697
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,360
These... Okay, guys, I'm gonna do something not very...

698
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,420
Alright, you pissed me off, guys.

699
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,060
I just wanted to color my tank.

700
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,800
There we go.

701
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,800
This might be a little extreme.

702
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,380
I love the Steve truck!

703
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,040
Now it's my turn to run them over.

704
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,880
True Boomers unite!

705
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,440
Thanks for the smile!

706
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,660
Thank you for the Akasuba!

707
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,200
Thank you, thank you!

708
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,680
Gary, thank you for the super chat!

709
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,420
Thank you, thank you!

710
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,920
Oh, thank you so much!

711
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,480
Yes!

712
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,740
That means I can...

713
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,800
Yes, you're free now!

714
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,220
A bit of an overkill bringing in the tank, but that's okay.

715
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,680
I can do now.

716
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,840
What do you mean?

717
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,480
Do whatever you want.

718
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,560
Yeah, you're free now.

719
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,100
Sure.

720
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,720
But now that I've been discharged from the Royal Army...

721
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,720
I don't have anywhere to go.

722
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,500
Come live in my town!

723
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,200
For real?

724
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,520
If he's got nowhere else to go...

725
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,440
I am a just prince.

726
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,480
How about inviting him to Spino?

727
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,600
Who's also the devil.

728
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,680
Right!

729
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,340
You can just go to Spino!

730
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,820
Gamble!

731
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,660
Thank you for the super chat!

732
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,260
Thank you, thank you!

733
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,660
Wink, wink!

734
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,460
It's a town looking for new residents!

735
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,000
Marvelous!

736
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah!

737
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,840
You're literally our first resident!

738
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,600
After eight hours!

739
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,720
We finally recruited another civilian!

740
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,140
Well, there's so few inhabitants.

741
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,420
It's almost a ghost town.

742
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,200
Oh, but it's not my fault though, I think.

743
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,380
I bet they'd be happy to have you.

744
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,900
Yeah, come live in my empty ass town so I can tax you later.

745
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,900
In that case, I might indeed be of use to them, yes.

746
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,320
I'll give it a shot, yes!

747
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,120
Oh my god, thank you!

748
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,000
Can I now color my tank?

749
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,580
Is my tank, like, colorable now?

750
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,460
Okay.

751
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,080
Let's check.

752
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,400
Oh my god, this is what it's like to have, like, a new resident?

753
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,000
Now pay my taxes.

754
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:41,570
Alright.

755
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,830
And then he's supposed to give me a quest too.

756
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,130
Where is he?

757
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,950
Where do you live?

758
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,090
Where the fuck do you live?

759
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,290
Okay, what did the- What did the dragoon who plotted this say?

760
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:57,490
I- After- After I saved that man's life.

761
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,050
Because now he owes me.

762
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,910
In the back?

763
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,530
Do I just, like, talk to him?

764
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,050
Okay, let's see...

765
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,190
He got killed already?!

766
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,890
I, like, just recruited him!

767
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,930
Yeah, of course.

768
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,070
If you live in my town, you would get, uh...

769
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,210
Good taxes.

770
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,570
Not the fake taxes in wherever you live now.

771
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:26,610
Hehehehe.

772
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,610
Uhhh...

773
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,410
Where is he?

774
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,330
Why is he hiding from me?

775
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,690
I don't understand.

776
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,330
Why would you hide from me?

777
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,110
Hehehehe.

778
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,590
Why?

779
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,790
Where are you?

780
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,950
I need the taxes.

781
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:48,810
Okay.

782
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,170
Hehehehe.

783
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,630
Hehehehe.

784
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,850
The other side?

785
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,410
Where the fuck is he?

786
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,750
Wait, is he actually hiding from- Is he- There you are.

787
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,490
Hello.

788
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,210
Oh shit, no.

789
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,090
Yes!

790
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,790
Oh, wait, what?

791
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,930
Is that it?

792
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,490
Hiding from the tax man.

793
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,390
Hehehehe.

794
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,710
Wait.

795
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,790
Oh my god!

796
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,370
Guy who plotted this!

797
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,670
What quest do I have to do next?

798
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,330
Cool quest.

799
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,550
Yeah, cool quest, bro.

800
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,930
Born to be silly.

801
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,550
Obliged to- Obligated to taxivate.

802
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,070
Alright.

803
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,230
Guess I have to...

804
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,430
Go out?

805
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,550
Oh, go outside and reload.

806
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,070
Okay.

807
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,010
Sorry.

808
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,050
My man has to be- My man has to reload his brain real quick.

809
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,930
No.

810
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,750
It still isn't offering it to me.

811
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,930
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

812
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,410
You're still not gonna offer me the quest?

813
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,250
Are you serious?

814
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,490
I'm coming over.

815
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,730
The tax man is coming.

816
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,250
Are you ready to pay the tax toll?

817
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,750
I'm gonna worry the money.

818
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:04,950
Okay.

819
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,350
Yes!

820
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,010
What the fuck is wrong with you?

821
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,390
What is wrong with you?

822
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,370
You're living in my town for free.

823
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,750
Give me my quest!

824
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:20,310
Every new civilian that moves into this quest has to- Has to pay the tax.

825
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,610
Or give me a quest.

826
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,130
The tax man is scary.

827
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,210
Listen, my man needs to be in the mood for questing.

828
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,130
Okay.

829
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,310
Oh, I need to finish the cave?

830
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,810
Are you fucking kidding me?

831
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:35,850
No!

832
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,210
I have to make an entire species extinct?

833
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,510
Ah, fine.

834
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,210
I guess if I am going to kill off an entire race...

835
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,070
I guess I...

836
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,950
I'm the best person for the job.

837
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,990
Alright.

838
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,270
Where is my motorcycle?

839
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,910
It's a very short quest.

840
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,430
I mean, I know because I'm very good at it.

841
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,690
Alright, here we go.

842
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,230
I'm very good at killing things in game.

843
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,190
I'm very good at killing things in game.

844
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,050
Alright.

845
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,250
It is right here.

846
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:15,950
Alright.

847
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,230
This is it.

848
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,090
Yeah!

849
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,110
We're coming over.

850
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,550
The things I do so I can put stickers on my car.

851
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,990
Make sure to check your computer.

852
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,350
You'll never know when something you've picked up might come to you.

853
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,750
Here you go.

854
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,550
Is that the strategy guide?

855
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,010
Wait, what the fuck?

856
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,610
Where is he?

857
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,170
Looks like it.

858
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,590
Oh my god, this is just free shit.

859
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,140
Is that it?

860
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,500
Give the guide to...

861
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,940
Wait, there's no dragon here.

862
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,960
I've been lied to!

863
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,940
It's literally just free items.

864
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,680
Alright.

865
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,860
Here we go.

866
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,450
Is that it?

867
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,670
Is that everything?

868
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,570
I think that's everything.

869
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,790
Alright, let's go back up.

870
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,170
Alright, I got you the book.

871
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,630
Where are you?

872
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,650
Wait, where's the guy?

873
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,910
Where is he?

874
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,170
Oh, he's over here.

875
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:28,710
Alright.

876
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,710
I got you your shit.

877
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,250
My dude.

878
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:31,910
Oh ho ho!

879
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,090
You really brought it.

880
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,950
Thanks!

881
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,410
Here's your reward.

882
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,490
Still, talk about tough luck.

883
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,170
After so many natural disasters.

884
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,590
There might be other blocked caves like this one.

885
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,650
True.

886
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,590
We'll keep an eye out for them.

887
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,990
Never mind that.

888
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,710
You'll let me read that guide, right?

889
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,510
Yeah.

890
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,170
I, Zeth, the giant beast hunter wrote it.

891
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,770
Read it with care.

892
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,210
Oh!

893
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,450
He gave me an instruction guide on how to kill other beasts.

894
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,230
What do we have here?

895
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,970
What sloppy handwriting.

896
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,090
A good match for Kyuki.

897
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,950
Oy!

898
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,150
What's this?

899
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,330
Old man, this looks like it was written by a toddler.

900
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,490
I wrote it on the road, so you might have to squint a little.

901
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,850
Why the fuck just rewrite it?

902
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,290
But it can't be that bad.

903
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,110
You write and drive?

904
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,510
Guys, don't write and drive.

905
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,430
Oh my god, Zeth!

906
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,210
Like right here, it says...

907
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,790
Why are you teaching these kids to write and drive?

908
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,990
Dragging a...

909
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,950
Oof.

910
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,650
See?

911
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,330
Damn.

912
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,290
Guess I have to rewrite it.

913
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,130
How unlucky can you get?

914
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,010
Next time, sit down one day.

915
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,330
Yeah.

916
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,950
This is why, guys.

917
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,590
Don't write and drive, everybody.

918
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,570
I know that.

919
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,190
I'll rewrite it carefully once I find a base for my hunt.

920
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,790
A base?

921
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,550
You're looking for a place to stay?

922
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,910
Wait, live in my house!

923
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,470
You should go to Spino then.

924
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:01,830
Yeah!

925
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,290
Spino?

926
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,790
Oh my god, finally another resident attacks.

927
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,650
I see.

928
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,930
Which means there aren't a whole lot of inhabitants yet.

929
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,690
Oh my god, guys.

930
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,550
Our town is gonna be so rich.

931
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,690
And by so rich, the one person that runs this town is gonna be so rich.

932
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,430
Alright, I'll move into that.

933
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:29,410
And once I'm done with the book, Gadgetragon will be on the menu.

934
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,570
Guess you'll be going hungry.

935
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,650
Another civilian!

936
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,930
I think you're unfortunately right.

937
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,650
Double the...

938
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,110
People, double the taxes.

939
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,830
That's...

940
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:41,910
That's...

941
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,910
Economics, baby.

942
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,110
Alright.

943
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:44,770
Now!

944
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,650
Now I should have some quests now, right?

945
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,410
Oh wait, I gotta get rid of all these check marks I made.

946
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,030
Alright, here you go.

947
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,690
A true gamer grinding for hours just for cosmetics.

948
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,990
Nice turn.

949
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,290
Thank you for the super chat.

950
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:01,610
Thank you.

951
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:01,990
Thank you.

952
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Infinite money glitch!

953
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,640
Not for the citizens living here, of course.

954
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,200
But for me!

955
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,360
I'm gonna...

956
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,200
Oh, is that it?

957
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,080
Do I now have enough civilians for a quest?

958
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,200
Oh my god.

959
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,720
Hello, sir.

960
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,520
I got us...

961
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,780
I got us some civilians, Mayor.

962
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,140
Enough what?

963
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,240
Yeah.

964
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,080
What's going on, Grandpa?

965
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,740
I'm gonna go get some more supplies.

966
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,440
Which is why I thought this would be a great opportunity.

967
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,600
For what?

968
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,380
To build new facilities for the town.

969
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,100
Oh my god!

970
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,860
That sounds great.

971
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,100
Where's the problem then?

972
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,540
We can finally have new homes!

973
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,000
We don't have enough materials to build new bridges or buildings.

974
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,300
Oh.

975
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,400
Oh yeah, we're poor.

976
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,040
We can make do salvaging old materials here and there.

977
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,920
I forgot about that.

978
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,660
But scraps are scraps.

979
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,980
I'd like to use something more...

980
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,340
I don't know much about construction.

981
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,720
It sounds like a lot of work.

982
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,440
Yeah, it does.

983
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,700
Work is hard.

984
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,500
Well, it would go faster if I could lay hands on some raptor steel.

985
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,200
God fucking dammit.

986
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,200
Not the raptor steel.

987
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,160
Raptor steel?

988
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,380
What's that?

989
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,720
It's a kind of metal that's been alloyed with raptor scales.

990
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,600
It's stronger and more malleable than normal steel.

991
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,500
Bolts, nuts...

992
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,600
You can even make pipes with it.

993
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,020
It can be used for almost anything.

994
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,320
It's just...

995
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,460
It can be used to upgrade vehicles too.

996
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,140
I know that.

997
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,320
I've been using it for vehicles.

998
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:47,900
Upgrade vehicles?

999
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,760
For real?

1000
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,660
Beelzebub, we've been doing this for like the last two parts.

1001
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,000
Beelzebub.

1002
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,380
Now you've got his interest.

1003
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,660
I'll help you get some if it means we can upgrade our stuff.

1004
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,860
I love the 3D models for this game.

1005
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,560
It's so good.

1006
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,560
I think...

1007
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,880
It doesn't look like a 3D model too.

1008
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,840
Wonderful.

1009
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,440
Your help would be most appreciated.

1010
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,200
However, you can't just find raptors.

1011
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,980
Thank you.

1012
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
You're a pilot.

1013
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,040
Only a skilled material processor would be capable of crafting some.

1014
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,780
Then we just need to bring someone like that to Spino.

1015
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,560
A skilled material processor?

1016
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,400
Oh, that's right.

1017
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,080
Back in the day, I used to know a skilled craftsman called Norrs.

1018
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,980
Nowadays, he's running a workshop in Talbo, I think.

1019
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,100
Could you go see him for me?

1020
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,540
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,980
Of course.

1022
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,360
Talbo?

1023
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,560
Okay.

1024
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,240
Guys, I just realized I put so much effort...

1025
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,760
Like, I'm putting so much effort in this town.

1026
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,800
But we're going to be leaving this town the moment I get the stickers.

1027
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,000
And everything I've done to this town will be for nothing.

1028
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,100
Because I won't be able to use it.

1029
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,120
I won't even be able to use this stupid village.

1030
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,320
Don't think about it.

1031
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,840
Yeah?

1032
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,400
For the stickers, Doki.

1033
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,460
Just think about the sticker.

1034
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,040
Guys, I just...

1035
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,520
I just want to paint.

1036
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,720
I just want to paint the tank.

1037
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,240
And use my 50 chairs.

1038
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,640
That's all I want.

1039
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:33,920
Why?

1040
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,340
Where does this guy fucking live?

1041
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,960
Where does he live?

1042
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,700
Get the flowers...

1043
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,880
Is it this one?

1044
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,460
It has to be this one, right?

1045
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,100
Icon list...

1046
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,000
Okay, I need to get rid of some stuff on my icon list.

1047
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,980
I feel like...

1048
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,240
You are...

1049
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,580
Okay, I need to know where I am.

1050
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,380
Uh...

1051
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,620
What is this?

1052
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,680
Where's self?

1053
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,460
Self?

1054
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,000
Okay, north is up.

1055
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,300
South is...

1056
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,160
Down.

1057
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,760
Right?

1058
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,540
Crying...

1059
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,720
Where is it?

1060
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,800
Grotto...

1061
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,720
Taboo...

1062
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,360
Is this?

1063
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,740
Where is it?

1064
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,120
You guys lied to me.

1065
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,300
Where the fuck is it?

1066
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,280
Where's Taboo?

1067
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,720
Guys, where is Taboo?

1068
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,660
Okay...

1069
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,320
This is the NEPS base.

1070
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,920
This is the NEPS checkpoint.

1071
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,280
Oh, there's Taboo!

1072
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,560
Oh, there it is.

1073
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,000
Found Taboo.

1074
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,100
I found Taboo.

1075
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,760
Oh my god.

1076
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,560
Get in here.

1077
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,660
I'm gonna abduct you to my town.

1078
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,820
Stan...

1079
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,100
Wait, his name is Stan?

1080
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,880
We are in an area where people's names are fucking Bezelbub and your name is Stan?

1081
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,600
Uh...

1082
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,640
Alright.

1083
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,240
And what does a demon like you want with me?

1084
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,440
Huh?

1085
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,180
We need you for parts.

1086
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,500
Are you looking for a material processor called Norse?

1087
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,460
Stan the man.

1088
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:32,700
Stan the man.

1089
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,640
Don't bully the man, Cass-Stan dude.

1090
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,920
Yeah, Cass?

1091
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,800
Is it because your name is also Stan?

1092
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,640
Oh shit, I'm sorry Stan!

1093
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,860
Bro!

1094
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,920
Oh my god, now he's sad guys!

1095
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,420
You made him... you made Stan sad!

1096
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,540
Yeah, how are we supposed to get that stuff?

1097
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,580
What do you mean I'm the rude one?

1098
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,740
Or live in my town Stan?

1099
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,300
Yeah, live in my town!

1100
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,400
Why would you want to live here?

1101
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,440
Yeah, but we want it to be convenient.

1102
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,450
I like how we don't even... we skip the explanation.

1103
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:50,690
What?

1104
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,150
But our town doesn't have a Stan!

1105
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,810
We need to fill the quota of names!

1106
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,910
I can't just leave my little sister here on her own.

1107
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,810
Well she can live with us!

1108
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,990
Is her name also Stan?

1109
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,670
Damn it...

1110
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,510
Why can't her little sister live with us?

1111
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,910
Oh, her name is Vess.

1112
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,230
I heard everything!

1113
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,530
Don't worry little demon, I'll come to Spino!

1114
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:23,910
Don't worry little demon, I'll come to Spino!

1115
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,170
Stan it!

1116
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:24,690
Yeah!

1117
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,390
Vess!

1118
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,410
Don't talk nonsense!

1119
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:29,510
Vess!

1120
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,510
Don't talk nonsense!

1121
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,970
It's not nonsense!

1122
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,190
I've been thinking for a while.

1123
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,350
You didn't even know Spino existed!

1124
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,810
That I want to leave the nest and open a workshop of my own!

1125
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,350
Oh, okay.

1126
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,110
I was gonna say, she's like...

1127
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:47,270
The moment I heard Spino, like five minutes ago, I knew that was the town for me.

1128
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:49,810
No!

1129
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,350
I won't allow it!

1130
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,210
Even with Pop's friend there, you can't go to a new town alone!

1131
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,790
It's always the same!

1132
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,450
We got the woman!

1133
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:02,850
It's so Stan!

1134
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,850
Let me live my own life!

1135
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:06,350
Yeah!

1136
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,810
I said no!

1137
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,050
Period!

1138
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,470
If you won't listen, then I'll go to Spino myself!

1139
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,850
What the f- Okay, that's like, fucked up bro.

1140
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,710
This is like her dream.

1141
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:23,010
And then you're like, you know what, fuck you, I'm gonna take your dream!

1142
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,090
I bet they'd rather have someone skilled anyway.

1143
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:28,470
Woah!

1144
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,550
What'd you say?

1145
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,890
Don't think I didn't hear that!

1146
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,830
Wow Stan, rude!

1147
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,450
Wait, you're right, we need women in this town!

1148
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,390
We recruit two male civilians!

1149
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,670
Guys, we need to balance the population out in our town!

1150
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,770
Of course I am!

1151
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,090
That's it!

1152
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,990
Let's face off to see who'll go to Spino!

1153
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,550
Oh shit, fight, fight, fight!

1154
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,450
Face off?

1155
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,810
We'll both make Raptors steal and see whose is better!

1156
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,090
This little demon here will be the judge!

1157
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,350
Winner goes to Spino!

1158
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,510
Sounds fun!

1159
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,990
Oh my god, I get free Raptor steal guys!

1160
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,030
I love free stuff!

1161
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,010
That okay with you little demon?

1162
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:13,730
Fine by me!

1163
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,570
Oh no, this is just like my Japanese fan comment!

1164
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,030
Right after you lend us a pure Raptor steal, that is.

1165
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,050
Oh now you guys don't want Stan!

1166
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,970
Just cause we have Vest now!

1167
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,150
What happened guys?

1168
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,310
You guys were cheering on Stan!

1169
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,490
But now you don't want him anymore?

1170
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,650
What the fuck happened?

1171
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,050
Not loyal, that's what happened!

1172
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,010
We just ran out!

1173
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,690
Ah, sure!

1174
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,670
Alright, we need some Pur-Purupdar scales.

1175
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,090
Do I have Purupdar scales?

1176
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,530
You need Purupdar scales to make Raptors!

1177
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,670
There's a Raptor cave north- Wait, that ran out?

1178
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,610
How did I fucking ran out?

1179
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,850
Okay, where the fuck is the cave?

1180
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,770
This one, right?

1181
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,110
Paterno...

1182
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,630
Um...

1183
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,710
Alright, we'll just...

1184
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,210
There has to be some Raptors nearby!

1185
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,490
You have to give- yeah, but like...

1186
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,070
But like, how- when did I- I ran out of fucking scales!

1187
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,830
Can I just buy them?

1188
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:32,830
Paterno!

1189
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:34,990
Uh...

1190
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,310
You're not useful at all.

1191
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:38,450
Alright.

1192
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:40,370
North or something.

1193
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,150
This is north?

1194
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,090
Oh, there it is!

1195
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,030
Alright.

1196
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,130
Oh, I should get rid of this then.

1197
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,710
Alright, there you go.

1198
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:49,870
Oh, I should get a tank.

1199
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,790
Cause we're gonna be running over some Raptors.

1200
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,330
Alright.

1201
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,230
He just told me- yes, but he used...

1202
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,270
marginal directions.

1203
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,430
Guys, I don't think you remo- You guys forgot I'm stupid.

1204
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,670
Alright, nice.

1205
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,290
We're gonna kill the whole family.

1206
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,050
Because...

1207
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,670
This is important.

1208
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:09,710
Oh, hey!

1209
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,110
Nice!

1210
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,370
Three for one special!

1211
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:13,910
Oh, we've ended!

1212
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,170
There was someone there to rescue?

1213
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,750
Nice.

1214
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,190
Wait, that's just a Raptor scale.

1215
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,730
Wait, it's just a regular Raptor scale.

1216
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,170
Any special Raptor scale?

1217
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,900
Uh, Magister.

1218
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1219
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,740
Thank you, thank you.

1220
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,200
Since we're all boomers here, can you finish this sentence?

1221
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,840
And that's the bottom line because...

1222
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,740
Is that a reference to something?

1223
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,610
Thank you for the super chat.

1224
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,450
Thank you, thank you.

1225
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:51,970
Behind me?

1226
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,010
Back when Taobao was thriving, this town was filled to the brim with craftsmen.

1227
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,030
No way.

1228
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,850
Alright, guys.

1229
00:50:59,290 --> 00:50:59,790
Leave me alone.

1230
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,630
I don't get that reference.

1231
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,390
Guys, don't pretend you don't understand that reference, guys.

1232
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,430
Don't...

1233
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,410
Guys, don't pretend, guys.

1234
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:22,990
Oh, there it is.

1235
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:23,870
There's the Raptor cave.

1236
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,430
What do you mean?

1237
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,630
We're literally here.

1238
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,610
Oh.

1239
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,830
Your Raptors are rare.

1240
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,850
I doubt they'll be that easy to find.

1241
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,490
What is a P-Raptor?

1242
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,190
I thought all Raptors are the same.

1243
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:40,990
Oh my god, look.

1244
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:41,590
There's eggs.

1245
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,150
You make me feel old.

1246
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,510
That's why you watch me.

1247
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,450
To feel young again.

1248
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,490
Guys.

1249
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,150
I'm here to make you guys feel young again.

1250
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,270
What?

1251
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,310
Yeah, P-Raptor the Raptor.

1252
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:58,670
Well.

1253
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:02,330
No!

1254
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,430
Oh, my tank.

1255
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:03,890
Yes.

1256
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,230
No!

1257
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,810
My tank can't fucking go upstairs.

1258
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,190
This is fucked up.

1259
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,350
This is so fucked up.

1260
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:13,570
Here?

1261
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:16,610
Where is it?

1262
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,490
Where is the P-Raptor?

1263
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,530
Oh, there he is!

1264
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,630
Oh my god.

1265
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,230
They're white.

1266
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,410
Okay.

1267
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:25,770
Guys.

1268
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,230
You know they said they're very rare.

1269
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,050
So let's make them rar- So let's make them rarer.

1270
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:32,590
Hahaha.

1271
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:34,610
Hahaha.

1272
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,090
Hahaha.

1273
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:35,550
Hahaha.

1274
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,510
Goodbye.

1275
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,630
Give me a sec.

1276
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,910
Doki, no!

1277
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:46,650
Hahaha.

1278
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,590
I need these materials.

1279
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:51,370
Hahaha.

1280
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,410
Supply and demand, baby.

1281
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,270
Alright, nice.

1282
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,750
We did it.

1283
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,230
Rare to endanger.

1284
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,530
Yay!

1285
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,870
Make the mix.

1286
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,490
Do it for the- Guys, it's for the stickers!

1287
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:10,730
Guys.

1288
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:13,730
Doki, yes!

1289
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:16,830
It's for the stickers!

1290
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:17,950
It's for the stickers!

1291
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,810
We worked so hard for those stickers, chat.

1292
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,270
Alright, let's see.

1293
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,270
Uh, where is...

1294
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:27,990
There you go.

1295
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,470
Albo.

1296
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,990
If you ever think you might be lost, you should check the map.

1297
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,150
That's on them for not- For not adapting to the tanks.

1298
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,610
Getting lost and having a backtrack would be a pain.

1299
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,110
Oh, oh!

1300
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:41,910
I either- guys!

1301
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:47,350
I think like, I give the raptor steel to either Stan or Vess.

1302
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,650
To choose whoever we want, guys.

1303
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,370
Alright, who are the Stan-Stans?

1304
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,050
Is that true?

1305
00:53:54,430 --> 00:54:00,090
Whoever I give- Whoever I give the raptor steel to will be coming to my town.

1306
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,650
Just wanna be sure.

1307
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,430
Doki needs stickers more than the world needs raptors.

1308
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:09,770
It's for a good cause.

1309
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,210
Thank you for the super chat.

1310
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,450
Thank you, thank you.

1311
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,810
Come on!

1312
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,250
Is that true?

1313
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:17,990
Is that true?

1314
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,610
Like, whoever I talk to would come to my town?

1315
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,590
Let Vess be independent.

1316
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,730
Let Vess be independent.

1317
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,490
Yeah, but why would I have to talk to both of them?

1318
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,810
Oh, oh, they both make it?

1319
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:32,850
You just choose in the end?

1320
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,650
Okay guys, they both make it, but I'll make the poll now in advance.

1321
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,610
We must fix the gender imbalance.

1322
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:41,330
Stan...

1323
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:42,890
The man...

1324
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:44,490
Vess...

1325
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,650
The woman...

1326
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,010
I don't know.

1327
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,130
I don't know what else to call her.

1328
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,950
Okay.

1329
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,630
Okay.

1330
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,370
Alright.

1331
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,570
Alright guys, here's your poll.

1332
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,390
Vess the best.

1333
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,530
Vess the last.

1334
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:05,070
Okay.

1335
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,210
Alright.

1336
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,390
Here, will this Piraptor scale work?

1337
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,270
Oh, geez.

1338
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,510
You actually got me one.

1339
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,510
Yeah.

1340
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,070
What?

1341
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:21,290
I feel bad, but...

1342
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,930
I was hoping you'd get it.

1343
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,710
I was hoping you wouldn't find any, so we could call this thing off.

1344
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,230
And forget about any of us going to another town.

1345
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,250
So that was your plan.

1346
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,090
How dare you!

1347
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,810
Since you brought one, I've got to do my job.

1348
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,470
I worked so hard killing off a species to make them endangered?

1349
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,810
I'll make my best raptor steal yet.

1350
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,150
Stan's kinda annoying.

1351
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,470
Stan's kinda annoying.

1352
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:51,550
Stan's kinda annoying.

1353
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:51,590
There.

1354
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,090
Done.

1355
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,010
This is why Vess is winning.

1356
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,850
The raptor steal Norris taught me to make.

1357
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:03,150
One look at that tells me how skilled a craftsman your father must have been.

1358
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,150
And it seems the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree.

1359
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,250
It's always nice to hear Pop get compliments.

1360
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,010
I'm pretty sure I'll win this.

1361
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,270
But it's all in your hands now.

1362
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:18,850
Alright, let's see what Vess will say.

1363
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,230
Alright.

1364
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:23,210
Alright, let's see what Vess says.

1365
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,890
Vess will appreciate me more.

1366
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,170
Yes!

1367
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,230
That's it!

1368
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:31,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1369
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:31,450
Now I can get started.

1370
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,210
Thank you.

1371
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:33,030
Who would win?

1372
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,650
A million years of evolution or one tank?

1373
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:35,990
Let's see.

1374
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,230
Thank you for the super chat.

1375
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:42,010
Hey, are you sure about this?

1376
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,430
Oh hey, Vess doesn't know how to make this guys.

1377
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:45,910
Like...

1378
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,190
Guys!

1379
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,930
It's her first time making raptors steal.

1380
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,630
Are you still on Vess?

1381
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:56,350
Oh, but don't worry, okay?

1382
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:02,990
If my tank falls apart because we got Vess and she does not know quality control.

1383
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,610
I swear to God.

1384
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,030
I watched Stan make it before.

1385
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,490
How are we supposed to not worry?

1386
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,650
Anyway, I'll get right to it.

1387
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:17,730
So wish me luck.

1388
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,630
Good luck.

1389
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,280
Here, check it out.

1390
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:28,820
Oh, it's a good thing.

1391
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,160
I did good, right?

1392
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,840
Guys, guys.

1393
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,040
It doesn't look like it's your first time.

1394
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,700
Oh, shit, Ral!

1395
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,280
That's so out of context.

1396
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,400
Maybe to the untrained eye.

1397
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,500
Give that here.

1398
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,680
Look closely.

1399
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,600
Scratch it a little with a tool.

1400
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,420
And...

1401
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:55,820
What?

1402
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,180
What?

1403
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,620
And what?

1404
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,000
Huh?

1405
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,700
Guys, the plating came right off, guys!

1406
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,480
Guys!

1407
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,260
Guys!

1408
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,360
Guys!

1409
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:11,540
Guys!

1410
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,780
My tank falls apart!

1411
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,940
No way!

1412
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:15,880
Why?

1413
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,840
I bet you forgot to treat the base metal surface.

1414
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,640
I bet you forgot to treat the base metal surface.

1415
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,200
Give her a chance, Doki!

1416
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:27,660
Give her a chance, Doki!

1417
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,420
Skip that step and the plating will come right off.

1418
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:30,640
Skip that step and the plating will come right off.

1419
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
She literally skipped the step, guys!

1420
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,700
It just slipped my mind, is all.

1421
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,180
It just slipped my mind, is all.

1422
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:41,760
Please...

1423
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,200
Give me another chance.

1424
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,500
Sure, why not?

1425
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,800
Okay, she sucks, but hear me out.

1426
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,660
Okay, she sucks, but hear me out.

1427
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1428
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,360
Thank you.

1429
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,680
Go ahead.

1430
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,300
Do it as many times as you need.

1431
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:57,880
She needs training.

1432
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,380
Who's gonna train her?

1433
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,960
We're picking one person!

1434
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:01,800
Thanks!

1435
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,240
I'll need more skills then.

1436
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,100
She needs me to kill off more raptors!

1437
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,720
So she can get better!

1438
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,820
So she can get better!

1439
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:11,860
Right.

1440
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,120
Well...

1441
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,820
Guess we have to get more.

1442
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,260
I have to get more?

1443
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,800
I have to get more?

1444
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,080
Guys, I have to get more skills because of her.

1445
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,040
Here you go.

1446
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,000
This is training, Doki.

1447
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,920
I'll get started right away!

1448
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,880
Thank god I had enough.

1449
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,180
Thank god.

1450
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:39,840
There!

1451
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:40,900
Done!

1452
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,280
Okay, what about this?

1453
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:43,980
Girl cute.

1454
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,280
Scrooge, thank you for the super chat.

1455
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,220
Thank you, thank you.

1456
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,980
But the plating is not coming off this time.

1457
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,880
Yeah, yeah.

1458
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,380
Let's see.

1459
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,700
Stan's gonna be like, I'm actually her.

1460
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,600
See?

1461
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:55,600
I'm actually her.

1462
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,040
Stan?

1463
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,500
Hmm...

1464
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,100
Don't you think about the population?

1465
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,940
Hey demon buddy.

1466
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,160
You confident in your strength?

1467
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,120
Of course I am.

1468
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,520
Who do you take me for?

1469
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,740
Then can you try bending this steel with all your strength?

1470
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,720
No matter how strong he is, it's impossible.

1471
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,460
I'm the fiend prince Beelzebub.

1472
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,960
Don't doubt my strength.

1473
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,240
Huh?

1474
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,060
Did I bend it?

1475
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,330
I did it!

1476
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,750
I cracked it!

1477
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,910
No way.

1478
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:41,810
Guys!

1479
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:42,810
How is that possible?

1480
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:46,870
If we f**king used her raptor steel to upgrade my tank.

1481
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,370
My tank is gonna get bent in half.

1482
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:53,170
What temperature did we do the heat treatment at?

1483
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,910
About 520 degrees Fahrenheit.

1484
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,770
But she's learning Doki!

1485
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,010
It doesn't count!

1486
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,570
He's learning Goku too!

1487
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:12,790
If I was Goku too, I would not be using a tank to kill everything.

1488
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,710
What is he doing?

1489
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,870
Stan is just trying to teach her.

1490
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:34,530
If I had Stan, I wouldn't have to teach her anything because I could just leave her in this village.

1491
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,350
That's true.

1492
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,190
That's true.

1493
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,930
I already killed off the population in that cave.

1494
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,090
I might as well.

1495
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,690
Just have them marry... They're fucking brother and sister!

1496
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:02,290
Musa... Musa, do you want to change your answer, Musa?

1497
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,430
Do you want to change your answer?

1498
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,330
I'll give up on going to Spino.

1499
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,480
It's done.

1500
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,920
This is the apocalypse not nitpicking?

1501
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,040
We just discovered water!

1502
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,060
It's not even an apocalypse!

1503
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,000
It's the one guy that was like, I'm gonna tax the water!

1504
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,900
Like, we literally discovered water!

1505
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,780
It's not even an apocalypse anymore!

1506
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,740
It's pretty much...

1507
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,820
Oh my god, wait, she is a prodigy!

1508
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,700
What the fuck?

1509
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,040
Wait, dragoons!

1510
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,220
This guy took years to learn this!

1511
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,520
Wait a minute!

1512
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,520
Guys, wait!

1513
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,720
Was she actually a prodigy?

1514
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,960
Guys, I told you guys.

1515
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,400
I knew we had to just...

1516
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,740
We had to just nurture her until she became even better than her brother.

1517
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,080
I fucking called it.

1518
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,920
I always believed in you!

1519
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,480
I always believed in you, Vess!

1520
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:24,180
She was just an unpolished rock, Crystal.

1521
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,880
I knew it.

1522
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,500
I fucking knew it!

1523
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,180
We have to give another one to Vess?

1524
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,320
No, I just... Okay.

1525
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,920
Alright, Stan, what do you want?

1526
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,840
Both our raptor steels are ready.

1527
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,100
Win or lose, no grudges.

1528
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,780
Please speak to the person you want in Spino.

1529
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,800
Oh, okay.

1530
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,120
Got it.

1531
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:53,920
Alright.

1532
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,700
Alright, guys.

1533
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:55,920
I don't know.

1534
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,600
He literally said that it's better than...

1535
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,980
Guys, I knew it.

1536
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,340
She was just an unpolished diamond, guys.

1537
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,640
She was an unpolished diamond and we polished her.

1538
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,080
So now... So now she's gonna... She's gonna be the one.

1539
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:13,540
I knew it.

1540
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,280
Are you sure you want me?

1541
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,680
Of course, Vess!

1542
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,860
Of course!

1543
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,640
It was always you, Vess.

1544
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,200
You're younger than Stan and like...

1545
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,160
Yeah, Diamond, you're younger than Stan.

1546
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,780
But like your first try only... It only took four... Actually, your fourth try.

1547
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,680
It nearly only took four tries to be better than him.

1548
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,460
So of course, Vess.

1549
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,640
Of course, I want you in my town.

1550
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,140
I beat Stan.

1551
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,560
You did, girl!

1552
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,160
You beat him!

1553
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,700
You were always my first choice, Vess.

1554
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,620
You...

1555
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,100
You were always my first choice.

1556
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:56,220
I needed a second chance.

1557
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,000
And a second second chance.

1558
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,260
But you chose me.

1559
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,520
So I'll do my best not to disappoint you.

1560
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,140
Maester, thank you for the super chat.

1561
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:08,500
Thank you.

1562
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,040
Thank you.

1563
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,480
Not fair.

1564
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,020
Stan is unaware because his favorite rapper didn't respond to his letters.

1565
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1566
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:15,660
Thank you.

1567
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,380
Thank you.

1568
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:17,760
No name.

1569
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1570
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:18,720
Thank you.

1571
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,260
Thank you.

1572
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,720
Nah, Stan just sucks.

1573
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,700
He didn't notice since there's not many Blacks in this.

1574
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1575
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:25,800
Thank you.

1576
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,260
Thank you.

1577
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,300
Still impulsive and unreliable.

1578
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,380
Oh, shit.

1579
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:28,860
You've got talent.

1580
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,420
Wait, what do you mean unreliable?

1581
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,680
Stan, you did not let me read the fine print.

1582
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,520
Stan!

1583
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,220
What do you mean unreliable?

1584
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:41,780
Stan!

1585
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,040
Stan!

1586
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,640
Guys, can I get a refund?

1587
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,400
I can't fix it.

1588
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,560
I'm sure she'll surpass me someday.

1589
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,500
It's your problem now.

1590
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,860
Guys, what the fuck does he mean unreliable?

1591
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,060
Stan!

1592
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,980
Right before she passed, mom asked, I hope I was able to fulfill her dying wish.

1593
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,100
Now she is your problem.

1594
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:10,940
Dang it.

1595
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,840
Now is not the time to be getting all gloomy.

1596
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,140
Guys...

1597
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,000
It's our last night.

1598
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,700
I've got to be cheerful for her sake.

1599
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,760
Guys, I don't know what he meant by that.

1600
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,240
He didn't explain anything to me.

1601
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,680
Now I'm a little worried.

1602
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,140
Yeah!

1603
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,720
I'm a craftsman now!

1604
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,470
You made the choice, Turkey.

1605
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,870
Now live with it.

1606
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,350
Cause I think it was super chat.

1607
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:45,650
Thank you.

1608
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:49,450
You're gonna be seeing a lot more of me from now on.

1609
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:53,370
Well, the moment I'm fucking finally able to decorate my tank, like, I'm gone.

1610
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,590
I'm fucking gone from this town.

1611
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,170
We're never coming back here.

1612
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:57,530
Oh, you're Tor.

1613
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,230
Back here again, I see.

1614
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,990
Zep wants to talk to you.

1615
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,410
Something about furniture?

1616
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,570
Ah, yes.

1617
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:06,690
Apologies.

1618
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:12,550
When looking out from this spot, I can feel the town's vitality.

1619
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:17,350
I suppose that's why I seem to find myself here all the time.

1620
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,510
I think I understand.

1621
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,290
Though we've still a ways to go.

1622
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,350
Being able to watch the town change before our eyes.

1623
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,870
Yeah, sorry that I didn't do this until now, guys.

1624
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:31,370
Sorry to my town.

1625
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:32,510
Sorry, Mayor.

1626
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:36,970
Sorry, Mayor.

1627
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,790
I could have done this a long time ago.

1628
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:39,350
Can we order a few pieces?

1629
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:40,730
Cease this publicity effort.

1630
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,190
I don't know about that.

1631
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,710
Bro, what the fuck?

1632
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,810
That's an adult voice coming out of this child.

1633
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,310
This kid fucking hit puberty.

1634
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,090
What the hell?

1635
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,410
I don't think any of the people I talked to ended up moving here.

1636
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,430
That is not a child.

1637
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,990
If anyone deserves credit, it's you, Prince.

1638
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,330
He's just short and ducky.

1639
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:12,530
There's no right or wrong in the now to tell them the truth.

1640
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:12,530
Fine.

1641
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,310
Not like I did it for them anyways.

1642
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,590
I'm just in it for making our bots stronger.

1643
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:23,530
In that case, we're going to need an EX chip store if we don't want their power plateauing.

1644
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,030
Materials and Anne's knowledge alone will only get us so far.

1645
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:30,590
Yeah, guess so.

1646
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,010
Well, back to work I go.

1647
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:33,630
I can't believe it.

1648
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,570
Finally, this town has three women.

1649
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:38,350
Or two because we're taking one of them away.

1650
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:40,310
To Greenland.

1651
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:42,530
Furniture!

1652
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:44,770
Oh my god!

1653
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,370
My fifty chairs!

1654
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,750
It's time!

1655
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:53,150
Now that you mention it, other townsfolk had similar grievances.

1656
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:58,530
The more people come, the more necessities arise, I suppose.

1657
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,910
It's time!

1658
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:01,730
Such is the way of things.

1659
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,190
There's no sure sign that vitality has returned to speed.

1660
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,590
After three weeks, my fifty chairs are useful!

1661
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:10,290
I'm so happy.

1662
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:12,610
Now is the time for action.

1663
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,590
Spino shall shine once more.

1664
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:20,010
Looks like your vitality's returned too, Mayor.

1665
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,550
Isn't that great, Hugh?

1666
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:24,430
Yup.

1667
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,780
Oh my god.

1668
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:30,200
It's time!

1669
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,820
A new workshop has opened.

1670
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:37,260
At Workshop, you can process ores and materials collected from hunting into necessary items for modding your vehicles.

1671
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,340
Also, check out the Workshop when you have a hard time finding a certain item.

1672
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,220
How do I decorate?

1673
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,540
Oh my god, guys!

1674
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,420
There's actual bridges now!

1675
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,320
Holy shit!

1676
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,040
The town is actually different!

1677
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,000
Great.

1678
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,800
Another failure.

1679
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,340
What?

1680
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:57,840
Bess?

1681
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,040
Don't make me regret this decision!

1682
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,520
Hey, Bess.

1683
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,480
What are you up to?

1684
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,260
You got eyes, right?

1685
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,240
Yeah.

1686
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,600
But that doesn't mean I know what I'm looking at.

1687
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,900
I'm working on material processing to grow our lineup.

1688
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,500
Yeah, god damn you!

1689
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,660
We just walked in!

1690
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,120
What do you mean, Bess?

1691
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,780
You just witnessed me ruining some of my most prized materials!

1692
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,020
Yours?

1693
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,940
Didn't I give you some of the materials?

1694
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,540
I bet my brother wouldn't be struggling like this.

1695
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,260
Oh, Bess.

1696
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,360
You're... I don't know about this now.

1697
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,220
Now you're making...

1698
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:46,580
Saying these things is sort of making me regret the decisions right now.

1699
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,940
It's literally day one.

1700
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,520
It's not looking good.

1701
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,000
Hey!

1702
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,180
I know when someone's spacing out on me.

1703
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:05,880
You know, if I improve my skills and our shop's lineup grows...

1704
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,520
You'll be able to make your vehicles stronger.

1705
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,780
Yeah, but Sam would have known these were...

1706
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,180
These things already, though.

1707
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,000
Wait, for real?

1708
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,240
Sam would have known already!

1709
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,220
The better the materials, the better they should perform.

1710
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,960
I knew you'd like that.

1711
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,240
I have a proposal... request.

1712
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:32,060
There's a merchant named Kuo whom I know from my Taobo days.

1713
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,360
Could you ask him to come to Spino?

1714
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,340
Another one?

1715
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,220
Wait, are you trying to get someone to come over here?

1716
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,020
To like, make up for your lack of experience?

1717
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,960
Like, I just got Stan!

1718
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,120
He's a peddler.

1719
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,340
Won't he turn up eventually?

1720
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,480
What do you mean by that?

1721
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:54,700
What?

1722
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,320
I have you know...

1723
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,260
I found two other citizens to tax today.

1724
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,680
So he only swings by when he feels like it.

1725
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,820
My town is perfectly profitable.

1726
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,140
I'm not going to be a peddler.

1727
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,060
The materials I ruined just now are pretty rare.

1728
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:19,540
Kuo's the only person I know who has them.

1729
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,300
So please!

1730
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,340
He's been obsessed with racing lately.

1731
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,220
He's probably near the Lysab race track.

1732
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,200
There's a race track?

1733
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,120
Fine.

1734
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,500
I guess it's worth it to power up our bots.

1735
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,960
But I don't even know what he looks like.

1736
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,060
Oh, that won't be a problem.

1737
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,620
What does he look like?

1738
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,060
He's a bit hard of hearing.

1739
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,340
You'll know him right away from his booming voice.

1740
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,300
I feel like he'd be like the only peddler there.

1741
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,440
Guess that'll work.

1742
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:49,320
I'll be...

1743
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:49,840
Thanks!

1744
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,800
I'll get my tools polished up and ready to go!

1745
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,740
Do you need to race him?

1746
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:55,060
Well...

1747
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,840
It's fun that you guys think I'm gonna do it.

1748
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,500
I only have one goal in mind here.

1749
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,040
Can I put stickers now?

1750
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,200
Is it time?

1751
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,320
Ann!

1752
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:11,540
Hello!

1753
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,800
Wait, okay, I'm not talking about you, Polack.

1754
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,440
Do you need anything?

1755
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:14,840
Ann!

1756
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,120
Can I...

1757
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,160
Can I decorate my vehicle now?

1758
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,040
Customize?

1759
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,540
No!

1760
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,430
See you later!

1761
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,470
When can I...

1762
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,150
Oh, other side quest.

1763
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,950
Oh my god, this guy.

1764
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:35,030
The soldier.

1765
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,170
He must be able to let me customize my stuff.

1766
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,790
The other soldier!

1767
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,650
Come over here.

1768
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:48,450
Man, what am I gonna do?

1769
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:50,690
I can't take on monsters.

1770
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,290
Then that's why you live in my town.

1771
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:53,990
Where?

1772
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,750
You don't have to deal with any of that work bullshit anymore.

1773
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,030
Nice shrink.

1774
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,790
What do you find scarier?

1775
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:04,470
Fiends or monsters?

1776
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,230
Oh, well I'm used to you now, Beelzebub.

1777
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:08,570
Yes.

1778
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:13,490
Anyhow, what's this about monsters?

1779
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:16,210
Sorry, I have to live with it for a bit longer.

1780
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:19,130
I have to still live in this village?

1781
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:24,690
If you go through, you can hear them growl from the cliffs.

1782
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:29,430
Peddlers are too scared to go through there now, I hear.

1783
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:34,050
If that rumor spreads, merchants might stop coming to town.

1784
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,410
No!

1785
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:38,330
Merchants already stopped coming to the town because we're poor, Ralph!

1786
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,190
We're fucking poor!

1787
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,110
So now it's my job to stamp the monsters out.

1788
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:49,470
But just because I'm an ex-soldier doesn't mean I'm a one-man army.

1789
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,750
What does that make me?

1790
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,230
I'm the one-man army.

1791
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,930
So why did you take on a monster hunting job in the first place?

1792
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:00,190
Well, I recently took on another job from a peddler.

1793
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:03,210
He had bought up too much cargo, you see?

1794
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:07,210
So the job was to keep it safe until he came back.

1795
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,890
Which I was more than happy to do.

1796
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:10,170
So...

1797
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:11,570
I accepted the job immediately.

1798
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:15,010
But when the peddler left, he joked...

1799
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:19,330
Don't you go selling any of that out from under me now.

1800
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:23,830
And, well, that gave me ideas.

1801
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,290
No, soldiers should not have ideas, Moss.

1802
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:30,950
Moss, no no no.

1803
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,510
A good soldier follows.

1804
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,150
I am just putting it all for peanuts to some random traveler.

1805
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:36,910
Oh yeah, never mind.

1806
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,130
You should definitely stop having ideas, Moss.

1807
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:41,150
You're a little stupid.

1808
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,150
You've really gotta work on that habit of yours.

1809
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:45,690
Cool.

1810
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:46,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1811
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:47,070
Thank you.

1812
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,490
Thank you.

1813
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:49,310
At least she is pretty, Tom Boy.

1814
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:50,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1815
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:51,050
Thank you.

1816
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:51,570
Thank you.

1817
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:52,570
I said I'd do anything to make it up.

1818
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:59,610
Turns out anything is go drive away hordes of monsters.

1819
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,450
Moss, how could you?

1820
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,110
Sounds like just desserts, honestly.

1821
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,510
Beat up monsters?

1822
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,530
Sounds like a good time to me.

1823
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,650
Then be my guest.

1824
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:13,010
If there really are monsters, that is.

1825
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:16,470
And if so, yeah, beat them up if you can.

1826
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,510
Oh my god.

1827
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,410
Moss, please.

1828
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,890
What do you mean?

1829
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,170
Beat up the monsters?

1830
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,810
Just give me the paint.

1831
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:32,990
Let me use my chair.

1832
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,990
That's the quest.

1833
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,370
Time to beat up some monsters.

1834
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:45,450
Alright.

1835
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:48,850
Alright.

1836
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,050
Self-tape.

1837
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:51,250
Is this one?

1838
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,290
Light on the hilltop?

1839
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,010
Is that the quest?

1840
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:59,390
Mysterious voice.

1841
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,670
I've never seen this one before.

1842
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,660
It has to be this one, right?

1843
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:09,680
Okay.

1844
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:12,940
Alright.

1845
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,320
Let's grab my motorcycle.

1846
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:22,350
Mysterious voice?

1847
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:26,930
Oh, mysterious voice is the quest?

1848
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:27,950
Okay, JK.

1849
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:30,530
We don't care about you anymore.

1850
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,410
Is this a waypoint?

1851
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:32,850
Oh, I can.

1852
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:33,570
I can just travel.

1853
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:34,950
Alright.

1854
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,150
Oh my god, this is it.

1855
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:39,610
This is it!

1856
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:43,590
What the fuck?

1857
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:45,230
What the fuck is that?

1858
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:46,590
Hello?

1859
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,050
We found those monsters?

1860
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:49,350
Hello?

1861
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,390
That sounds promising.

1862
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:52,270
Who's that?

1863
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,930
We must be getting pretty close.

1864
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:55,890
What?

1865
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:56,990
He disappeared.

1866
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,190
Oh, we have to find him.

1867
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,150
Oh, but there's loot here.

1868
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,390
Where is he?

1869
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,030
We have to find him?

1870
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,670
Wait, there's something over here.

1871
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:16,890
There's a green thing over here.

1872
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:18,710
Oh no, that's just more gems.

1873
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:19,490
JK.

1874
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:23,510
That's just more gems.

1875
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,610
Did you use a jump bot?

1876
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,270
Oh, because of this?

1877
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:28,190
So much sand flowing in.

1878
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:29,910
Where does it go from here?

1879
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,350
Wait, I can jump this.

1880
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,030
Who knows?

1881
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,170
Okay, never mind.

1882
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:34,430
It's a mystery.

1883
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,010
A mystery far beyond our understanding.

1884
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:39,150
Maybe we'll know in a thousand years.

1885
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:39,630
Alright, guys.

1886
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:40,570
I was just thinking.

1887
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:41,670
Maybe I should start saving.

1888
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,770
I was like...

1889
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,230
I feel like...

1890
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,590
Sorry for the...

1891
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:48,710
For that.

1892
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:49,870
I feel like...

1893
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:53,050
I don't know how much the side quest saves.

1894
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:54,250
So I'm going to start saving now.

1895
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,250
Sorry, guys.

1896
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,730
Oh, are you the mysterious voice?

1897
01:18:59,050 --> 01:18:59,950
Why are you scared?

1898
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,990
Hey, that voice.

1899
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:20,910
Wait, the monsters were just you groaning?

1900
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:21,750
That was you?

1901
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:27,970
Somebody help me.

1902
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:29,190
Is that how you fucking cry?

1903
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:30,730
Take it easy.

1904
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:31,850
You're all right now.

1905
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:32,870
Nerd.

1906
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,170
Wait, you're...

1907
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:38,910
You know this guy, old man?

1908
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:40,710
No.

1909
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,750
I'm sorry, but I don't recognize him.

1910
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:42,990
Hey, who are you?

1911
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,110
You wouldn't.

1912
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:47,350
We met over 20 years ago.

1913
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,130
Oh, when he was a baby.

1914
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,770
I was scared stiff up on a high place then, too.

1915
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,350
And you saved me.

1916
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,170
Wait, you're not that boy, Shion, are you?

1917
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:57,110
That's him.

1918
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,070
That's right.

1919
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:03,330
I was crying so much that I didn't get a chance to thank you.

1920
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:05,750
I always regretted that.

1921
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,290
And I hoped I'd get another chance.

1922
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,770
I'm glad we got that chance.

1923
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:11,810
What did he get up to?

1924
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:12,690
Shion from 20 years ago?

1925
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,890
How about we get him down from there before you two start catching up?

1926
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:19,290
How did he get up here, though?

1927
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,690
If he's so scared of heights?

1928
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,490
Seems like I got down in one piece.

1929
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:30,190
Thank you.

1930
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,350
So, what are you up to these days?

1931
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,430
Well, I've become a painter.

1932
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,450
Oh my God!

1933
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:39,130
I'm still just an apprentice, though.

1934
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:41,230
Let's fucking go!

1935
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,590
You sure have grown up.

1936
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:48,170
No wonder I couldn't peg you as that kid who would start crying at the drop of a hat.

1937
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:48,770
This is it!

1938
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:55,650
I may not be a child anymore, but I'm still just as much of a scaredy cat.

1939
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:58,990
Shion, thank you for the super chat!

1940
01:20:59,050 --> 01:20:59,610
Thank you, thank you!

1941
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,890
By the way, light on the hilltop unlocks furniture!

1942
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,270
Okay, we're doing the furniture one next.

1943
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:06,410
What about you, Mr. R?

1944
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:08,290
You can mash the OK button when deploying a vehicle.

1945
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,530
Jump into it instantly.

1946
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,170
From what I can see...

1947
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:14,010
You're on the road with some demon friends?

1948
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,550
You got some beef with demons.

1949
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,950
Yeah, you got some beef there.

1950
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:18,890
Chairs?

1951
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:26,390
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1952
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:28,670
Prince, knock it off.

1953
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:33,090
We're currently traveling using Spino as our base of operations.

1954
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:35,030
Spino?

1955
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,410
I've never been.

1956
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:38,710
Oh, you're gonna love it here.

1957
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,350
I hope you like paying taxes, too.

1958
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,170
I'm not a work in progress, but it's a good town.

1959
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:48,010
You know, I've been looking for a place to settle down.

1960
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,250
Oh my god, another one.

1961
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,170
If it's good enough for you, then I'm sure it is for me.

1962
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:56,490
Guys, unfortunately we have imbalanced the towns.

1963
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:00,030
We always have the welcome mat out.

1964
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,990
We might have a town imbalance again, guys.

1965
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,010
Trust me, demons aren't as fearsome as you've heard.

1966
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:11,990
Are you sure?

1967
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:17,090
Well, they don't look that scary.

1968
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,130
So, maybe?

1969
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:23,630
Come on, old man.

1970
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:25,050
You're killing my rep here.

1971
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:27,430
Sorry.

1972
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,930
Then my mind's made up.

1973
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,330
I'm moving to Spino.

1974
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:33,570
I don't think he's a threat in that...

1975
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:34,190
What are you trying to say?

1976
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:35,390
He can get a woman?

1977
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,590
As soon as I pick up my belongings, I'll head right there.

1978
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,210
Some women like nerds?

1979
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:40,910
Out there?

1980
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,290
I don't know about the ones in my town, but like...

1981
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,790
One of them might.

1982
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:47,750
I will.

1983
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:49,010
See you.

1984
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,920
He's a painter.

1985
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,740
Just like Leonardo DiCaprio from Titanic.

1986
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,860
Guys, that guy got women.

1987
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:05,100
He painted one like the French girls.

1988
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,480
You can't say that.

1989
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,800
Oh, Ron.

1990
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,700
What do you mean, Ron?

1991
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,240
He was a bad painter.

1992
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,380
But he's hot.

1993
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:27,320
Hey, his painting skills helped out.

1994
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,740
Counterpoint means DiCaprio.

1995
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,860
Here we go.

1996
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,980
There's hope for...

1997
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,620
Alright.

1998
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:43,100
We gotta go get that furniture too.

1999
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:48,810
We gotta get that furniture.

2000
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:50,550
And then he...

2001
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:52,590
Look, we're not talking about the fact that he died.

2002
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,670
We're talking about the fact that like...

2003
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:57,670
That he did get it.

2004
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:00,230
Oh, wait.

2005
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,990
You're not what I wanted to...

2006
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,290
You're not the quest I needed to do.

2007
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:03,970
So I'm sorry.

2008
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:11,390
I like how like in the distance I hear him yell for help.

2009
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:12,330
Sorry.

2010
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,450
You're not that important.

2011
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,090
I'm sorry.

2012
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:15,230
What?

2013
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:15,950
What?

2014
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,590
Wait, you can get me off the fucking motorcycle?

2015
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:20,410
Okay.

2016
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:24,230
I was like running over scorpions thinking I can like...

2017
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,310
I don't have to care.

2018
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:28,910
Alright.

2019
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:30,290
Do be careful, Prince.

2020
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:30,830
It's fine.

2021
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,410
We can ride past this.

2022
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,650
Oh, there you go.

2023
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:35,670
Furniture is here.

2024
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,630
Furniture is here.

2025
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:41,650
Leave him to get eaten.

2026
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:42,850
Look, I'm sorry.

2027
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:44,090
It just wasn't as important.

2028
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:45,930
We gotta...

2029
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,370
We gotta get the furniture unlocked.

2030
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:50,190
Wait!

2031
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,190
Guys!

2032
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:53,650
We fixed the problem instantly!

2033
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,310
Do you see something in the sky?

2034
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:02,510
Something flashed on that hill over there.

2035
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,630
I'd love to know what it is.

2036
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,110
But I can't see anything from here.

2037
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,470
I've got an idea.

2038
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,610
How about I climb on your shoulders?

2039
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:13,570
Wait, what?

2040
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,670
Wait.

2041
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:17,110
Are you...

2042
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,150
A demon?

2043
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:22,310
Scared you?

2044
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,830
I've never been so shocked.

2045
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,330
You're the first one I've ever seen in my life.

2046
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,410
Oh my god, Megabear Muse?

2047
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:29,810
She's also an artist too!

2048
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:32,210
I told you guys!

2049
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:33,930
There's hope for everybody!

2050
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,850
Even better.

2051
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:39,470
We're gonna play matchmaker.

2052
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:40,450
I can't believe you're up to that.

2053
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:40,990
I'm a fan of you as an artist.

2054
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:44,910
Demons really are something else.

2055
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,730
This girl is a total weirdo.

2056
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:49,030
I'm outta here.

2057
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:52,390
I'm afraid I can't let you.

2058
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:53,310
What?

2059
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:54,890
I want to draw you.

2060
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:55,970
Wait, what?

2061
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,390
And you're not going anywhere till I do.

2062
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:00,470
I don't feel comfortable with this.

2063
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:01,970
Excuse me?

2064
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:06,070
I'd love to get started right away.

2065
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:09,710
But I'm the type to do things one at a time.

2066
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:09,990
Huh?

2067
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,110
Which means...

2068
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:12,950
I can't wait for her.

2069
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:13,910
She's weird.

2070
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:14,850
...first order of business is gone.

2071
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:16,170
But I'd be ill to see what that light was.

2072
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,490
Could you wait for me?

2073
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,730
I should be back in three days.

2074
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:20,110
Wait, wait.

2075
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:20,890
Three days?

2076
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:22,530
We need you in the town now.

2077
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:25,230
I feel like we'd sit around and wait that long.

2078
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,130
Oh, what to do, what to do?

2079
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:33,730
It'd be faster if I had a vehicle that could jump high.

2080
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:38,070
Anyway, you can't leave until I've investigated that light.

2081
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:39,610
Understood?

2082
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:39,690
I'm sorry.

2083
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:42,890
Oh, I don't need anything for furniture.

2084
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:46,050
I can't draw you until I've checked it out, right?

2085
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:49,110
And I won't let you leave until I have.

2086
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,550
So you're stuck here.

2087
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,150
Oh my gosh, she's so assertive.

2088
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:54,350
This really is a bit of a pickle.

2089
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:59,370
I'll never understand just what goes on inside artist's heads.

2090
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:01,830
Oh, I know!

2091
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,550
You can go check it out for me and tell me what it is.

2092
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:08,350
Oh, that's a lot easier.

2093
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:09,530
The mystery will be solved.

2094
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:11,030
I have a jump bot too!

2095
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:13,230
Then you'll be free to leave.

2096
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:16,030
Yeah, it's a win-win for everyone.

2097
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:16,750
Yay!

2098
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,490
You just have lint floating around in the head of yours.

2099
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,090
Whoa, Beezlebub, that's so rude.

2100
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:24,110
Oh!

2101
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:27,690
Just because she's a freak doesn't mean she's dumb.

2102
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:31,970
How about you open it up and take a look for me?

2103
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:33,070
Ugh!

2104
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,790
You're grossing me out.

2105
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:39,070
Well, it seems we have no choice but to do as she asked.

2106
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:40,970
Fine.

2107
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,510
I'll check that hill for you.

2108
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:45,710
Guys, Beezlebub, please think about the furniture, Beezlebub.

2109
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:47,670
I promise you'll get off my back once I do.

2110
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,050
Think about the furniture!

2111
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,050
Woohoo!

2112
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,610
And that 50 chairs!

2113
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:53,670
I promise!

2114
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:56,230
Come to think of it, I haven't introduced myself.

2115
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,010
I'm Luteimus, a craftsman.

2116
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:00,490
How about you, Beezlebub?

2117
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:01,110
Whoa!

2118
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:02,650
He's a child!

2119
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:04,110
Yellzebub.

2120
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:09,130
He might be like a 500-year-old child, but like he's still a child.

2121
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,530
He's been killed in demon years.

2122
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,150
Yellzebub!

2123
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,550
Oh, even your name is beautiful!

2124
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,410
Whoa!

2125
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:19,790
Get away from her!

2126
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:24,490
Oh my god.

2127
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,530
We gotta go up here.

2128
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,190
Okay, we have the jump bot.

2129
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:29,890
Uh...

2130
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:30,770
It's time.

2131
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:32,630
Boom.

2132
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:35,170
Alright, lady.

2133
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:38,010
We have a painter nerd just for you.

2134
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:39,350
We just recruited one.

2135
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:40,630
Don't worry.

2136
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,730
We're gonna play matchmaker for her.

2137
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:44,690
Is it?

2138
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:51,010
Is it this?

2139
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:55,610
Oh, okay.

2140
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,410
That's fine.

2141
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,090
Alright.

2142
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,050
We found the treasure.

2143
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:00,890
It had nothing.

2144
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:10,630
I was glinting off it.

2145
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,470
It was already looted.

2146
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:12,950
Whoa!

2147
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,090
A treasure chest?

2148
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,530
There wasn't even anything in there.

2149
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:20,010
The world sure is full of wonders.

2150
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:25,030
That means treasure could be at the top of other hills too!

2151
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:30,670
Well, the only treasure for me right now is...

2152
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:31,310
Whoa!

2153
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:32,530
No!

2154
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:36,070
I don't know if I want her in my town anymore, guys.

2155
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,050
I think we might have a problem.

2156
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:44,670
Wow!

2157
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,370
Bezebub, no!

2158
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,810
You don't... don't... what's the wait?

2159
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:49,750
Don't incur... don't enable her!

2160
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:55,950
Bezebub, don't enable her!

2161
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:02,410
Wow!

2162
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,050
Bro!

2163
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,710
What the fuck is wrong with her?

2164
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:08,610
Are you kidding me?

2165
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,730
No way you're coming with us!

2166
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,270
My vote is a no too!

2167
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:15,550
Yeah, no!

2168
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:16,950
No, I'm sorry!

2169
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:20,750
Guys, we can't... guys, we can't let her in!

2170
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:24,270
What?!

2171
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:28,370
What the fuck, run her!

2172
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:29,490
Run her!

2173
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:35,330
Oh my god!

2174
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:38,350
I guess.

2175
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,070
But you can't live there!

2176
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:41,910
Yeah, no, don't let her live there!

2177
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:44,210
Don't let her live there!

2178
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:47,410
Right!

2179
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:47,890
Spino!

2180
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,610
They're looking for new residents!

2181
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:50,330
No!

2182
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:51,210
Bezebub!

2183
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:55,310
I don't think legally she's allowed to!

2184
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,590
Got it!

2185
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:01,450
I was looking for a place to set up my real trade.

2186
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:02,370
Furniture making.

2187
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,550
So this is perfect.

2188
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:05,150
No, no, no, no!

2189
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:07,950
I have this town with you and it is better than perfect.

2190
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:09,570
I'll head there at once!

2191
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,230
Oh my god!

2192
01:31:14,530 --> 01:31:15,130
Shit!

2193
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:17,050
What the fuck?!

2194
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:21,130
Holy shit!

2195
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:22,990
This won't stop!

2196
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:25,750
Don't make eye contact and just keep walking!

2197
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,670
Just keep walking, Bezebub!

2198
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:31,270
Never!

2199
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:32,350
Thank you for the super chat!

2200
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:32,750
Thank you!

2201
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,370
Thank you!

2202
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,250
Oh shit!

2203
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:38,470
It's stranger danger!

2204
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:42,590
You don't meet someone that troublesome every day!

2205
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:43,770
Finally, cheers!

2206
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:44,790
Guys!

2207
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:51,130
Guys, I don't know if furniture was worth it in the end!

2208
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:51,850
Guys!

2209
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,910
Guys, finally, cheers!

2210
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:55,250
But at what cost?

2211
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:57,990
Thank you for the super chat!

2212
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,530
Thank you!

2213
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:59,150
Thank you!

2214
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:00,410
Ninja!

2215
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:02,230
Well, Doki, you got your wish!

2216
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,870
You can use your chairs now!

2217
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:08,810
Guys!

2218
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:11,150
We have chairs now!

2219
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,990
Guys!

2220
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:17,310
Guys!

2221
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:20,530
We have chairs!

2222
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:24,530
Nice!

2223
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:27,130
This is one picturesque town!

2224
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:29,890
Have a feeling I won't be bored around here!

2225
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:40,230
You now have a room!

2226
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:43,530
Your room is locked in the garage in Spino!

2227
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:46,810
Get furniture to- Okay, we are not coming!

2228
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:49,250
We are not going to fucking- Guys!

2229
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:51,250
We have a room though!

2230
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:52,850
Guys!

2231
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:54,790
We did it!

2232
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:55,910
Oh my god!

2233
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:58,690
We're not going to go near that woman!

2234
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,150
But guys!

2235
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:01,650
We have a room!

2236
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:03,830
Do you need anything?

2237
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:06,150
Yes.

2238
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:07,530
Where's my room?

2239
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:11,130
Wait, how do I get to my room?

2240
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:12,390
Is my room still locked?

2241
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,030
When does it get unlocked?

2242
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,270
Oh my god, the town does look better!

2243
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,510
But the chairs...

2244
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:23,910
Oh, it's in the back of the garage!

2245
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:24,690
Okay.

2246
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,310
Okay.

2247
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:27,850
So like...

2248
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:29,250
Wait, what?

2249
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:31,990
Go around the back.

2250
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:35,730
Oh, okay.

2251
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,130
Oh, wait.

2252
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:36,910
What's this?

2253
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,930
Oh, there's free stuff.

2254
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,270
I'm around it.

2255
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:41,530
Where the fuck is my room?

2256
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,810
Oh, to the back inside!

2257
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:46,590
Guys, it's okay.

2258
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:47,710
As long as we never...

2259
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:50,250
You know... go near her, we're fine.

2260
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:52,750
Where the fuck?

2261
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:54,230
Where's my room?

2262
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:58,750
Where's my room?

2263
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,410
The shutter?

2264
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:08,170
Where the fuck is my room?

2265
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:10,690
No!

2266
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,250
Anne,

2267
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:16,570
where's my room?

2268
01:34:20,710 --> 01:34:21,310
Anne!

2269
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:26,990
Maybe talk... No, we're not gonna talk to her!

2270
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:28,610
We're not...

2271
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:32,650
Guys, we're not gonna talk to her, guys!

2272
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,410
What about the other guy?

2273
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,370
Wasn't there the painter guy?

2274
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:42,290
Okay.

2275
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:46,030
You might have to... No, okay.

2276
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:47,390
Okay.

2277
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:49,070
Alright.

2278
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:50,750
It's alright.

2279
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,310
We'll be fine.

2280
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:54,430
We'll be fine.

2281
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,090
Heya, Beelzebub!

2282
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,890
This is a nice town.

2283
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,470
Full of inspiration.

2284
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,410
I think I'll make good furniture here.

2285
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:06,150
You'll like my work, too.

2286
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:09,810
Here, try putting this in your space and see if it fits.

2287
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,990
Oh, and please spare me some time to dry you.

2288
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,490
I'm busy right now.

2289
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:18,490
Another time.

2290
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:24,570
Oh my god, she had the key!

2291
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:32,010
That's so fucked up.

2292
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:34,150
She had the key all along.

2293
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:40,490
Alright, let's get the paint as well.

2294
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:44,690
Oh my god, this town is looking like actually pretty.

2295
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:47,930
It only took two hours.

2296
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,030
Hey, good to see you, yes?

2297
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:54,830
How'd the monster thing turn out?

2298
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:55,570
I did it.

2299
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,170
Piece of cake.

2300
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:00,770
One hand tied behind your back, huh?

2301
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:02,950
That's our Beelzebub!

2302
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:06,530
Actually, there weren't any monsters at all.

2303
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:07,910
Just a human.

2304
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,810
Yeah, just a nerd.

2305
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:12,110
He was stuck up a cliff making all sorts of weird noises.

2306
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:14,750
I can see why they freak people out so much.

2307
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:18,910
To my surprise, it was Shion, an old acquaintance of mine.

2308
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,030
He's moving to Spino.

2309
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:22,410
Treat him right, would you?

2310
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:24,170
Understood, yes!

2311
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,550
What is his job anyway?

2312
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:28,370
Everybody else has a job, but he's just there.

2313
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,490
Thanks again!

2314
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:32,150
I should be squared away with that peddler now.

2315
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:35,770
Try not to stick your foot in it next time, okay?

2316
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:39,490
Y-you know you're just giving me ideas.

2317
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:43,050
He's definitely gonna get into trouble again.

2318
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:48,210
He's a one-man army doki.

2319
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:49,610
Oh, the painter's here!

2320
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,570
Raul was right.

2321
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:55,930
Spino really does seem like a lovely place.

2322
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:58,490
We're finally gonna have color!

2323
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:00,870
Oh

2324
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:06,910
god!

2325
01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:13,030
We can put decals!

2326
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:16,110
Okay, we're gonna cut- oh my god, finally.

2327
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:18,210
We finally did it!

2328
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:22,570
I'm gonna decorate the room that I'll never come back to after I leave Sandland.

2329
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,250
But this is it, finally!

2330
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:29,770
It has- all these side quests has led to this one moment.

2331
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:32,810
Oh my god.

2332
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:35,710
Wait, why did Anne have like a...

2333
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:39,850
Why did Anne have that thing on top of her head?

2334
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,170
So like...

2335
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:47,890
Like why did she have like a little thingy pop up?

2336
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:50,870
Make part- oh, it's cause of the parts!

2337
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:52,250
I see!

2338
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:53,690
Okay.

2339
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,470
There we go, move.

2340
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:57,970
There we go.

2341
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,710
Oh my god, finally.

2342
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:05,690
You can personalize your room by using press to open- you can place the furniture from the room.

2343
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:07,470
Oh my god!

2344
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:11,930
The room layout.

2345
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,970
Select the- GUYS!

2346
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,110
Did you guys see the fifty?

2347
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:18,730
Guys!

2348
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:24,330
I can finally use my fifty fucking chairs!

2349
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,670
Oh my god!

2350
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:32,290
Oh, it's finally here!

2351
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,950
I'm so happy!

2352
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,110
It's finally here!

2353
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:41,930
I finally- Oh my god!

2354
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:45,150
It's finally here guys!

2355
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:47,030
My fifty chairs!

2356
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:48,530
Okay.

2357
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,910
Choose to select.

2358
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:53,230
Okay.

2359
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:58,150
Um, selecting a- We need some virtual life!

2360
01:38:58,410 --> 01:38:59,110
Please!

2361
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:02,270
We finally did it!

2362
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:04,350
Oh my god!

2363
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:08,090
This is everything we wanted!

2364
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:09,730
And more!

2365
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:12,810
I can't believe it.

2366
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:14,890
Holy shit.

2367
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:16,530
Where the fuck is my chairs?

2368
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:17,570
Oh!

2369
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:20,370
Oh my god!

2370
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:20,970
There it is!

2371
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:22,670
There it is!

2372
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,730
We finally did it!

2373
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:28,090
Oh my god.

2374
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,850
Oh this is all I wanted to do.

2375
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:33,710
Oh my god.

2376
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:34,150
Finally!

2377
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:34,330
Oh my god.

2378
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:34,670
Finally!

2379
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:36,150
Holy shit!

2380
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:38,790
This is actually everything we wanted!

2381
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:42,630
I can finally place my 50 chairs!

2382
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:46,670
Yay!

2383
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,330
Oh my god, I can put chairs here too?!

2384
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:50,310
Oh!

2385
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:54,370
Here we go!

2386
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:57,230
Here we go!

2387
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:57,790
Nice.

2388
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:01,210
Okay.

2389
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:02,390
Woah, what the fuck?

2390
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:04,170
Okay, and then two sofas too.

2391
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:04,850
Okay, nice.

2392
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:08,650
Alright, and then just place only chairs.

2393
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,490
Here we go!

2394
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:13,430
We did it!

2395
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,350
We did it!

2396
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:17,510
We got our chairs!

2397
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:27,090
Oh my god, we finally got our chairs, guys!

2398
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:34,630
All it took was 200 side quests!

2399
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,790
All it took...

2400
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:39,630
Okay, and then we'll put...

2401
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:41,530
There we go.

2402
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,130
There we go.

2403
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:42,390
Nice.

2404
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:45,230
And then we should grab...

2405
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:48,150
Wait, we can put a... Oh shit, we can put a car in here?!

2406
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,910
Oh my god, let's put bed of dragoons.

2407
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:52,270
Let's put a scam.

2408
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:57,770
We'll put dragoon in here.

2409
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:58,230
We'll put a car in here too.

2410
01:40:58,670 --> 01:40:59,350
Fuck it.

2411
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,590
We have space, right?

2412
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:03,230
Do we have space for the dragoon?

2413
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:04,310
There we go.

2414
01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:08,010
Look at this feng shui!

2415
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,250
Look at that.

2416
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:10,150
You know what?

2417
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,870
Decor.

2418
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,210
Alright, what is the decor gonna be like?

2419
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:15,270
Okay.

2420
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:17,090
I can't believe it.

2421
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:19,510
I knew it wasn't a myth, guys.

2422
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:27,170
I fucking knew it.

2423
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:29,230
I knew it was real!

2424
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:32,270
You guys just thought I was crazy!

2425
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:35,410
I knew.

2426
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:37,630
I knew my chairs were real.

2427
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,910
I fucking knew it.

2428
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:47,810
I fucking... No, I'm gonna get rid of all the sofas and just keep the chairs.

2429
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:48,990
Let's see.

2430
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:52,630
Edit furniture.

2431
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:54,910
Okay, how do I make sure to get rid of this?

2432
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,510
Alright, we're gonna get rid of like the non...

2433
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,310
We're gonna...

2434
01:41:58,810 --> 01:41:59,250
Okay.

2435
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:01,610
We're gonna get rid of the sofas.

2436
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:02,270
Okay.

2437
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:04,790
Remove.

2438
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:09,630
It should be... It should just be like the chairs.

2439
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:10,810
The sofas and...

2440
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:12,270
Yeah, let's get rid of...

2441
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:14,570
Let's get rid of the hideout beds too.

2442
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,210
And then...

2443
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:16,990
And then...

2444
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:18,330
We don't need beds here.

2445
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:19,310
We have our chairs.

2446
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:22,310
So...

2447
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:25,330
Alright, we're gonna get rid of the...

2448
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:28,630
We're gonna get rid of all the sofas.

2449
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,630
Because this is just a chair home.

2450
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:32,590
You know?

2451
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:35,050
This is right... No, no!

2452
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:35,370
See?

2453
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:38,950
We're just getting rid of all the sofas.

2454
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:42,830
Okay, yep.

2455
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:43,930
Alright.

2456
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:44,750
Is that everything?

2457
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:45,930
No, there's still more.

2458
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:46,990
How is there still more?

2459
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:47,710
How...

2460
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:48,970
Oh my god, you're right.

2461
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:50,390
Sorry, I had 50 sofas.

2462
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,210
I was like...

2463
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,510
How do I still have more?

2464
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:56,290
Oh right!

2465
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:57,490
50 sofas.

2466
01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:00,430
Now I remember how I still have more.

2467
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:01,390
There we go.

2468
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:03,270
Me and my chairs.

2469
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:04,490
Okay.

2470
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:09,590
This shit is beautiful.

2471
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,590
Oh my god, it's a beautiful customized color.

2472
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:13,670
Ooh!

2473
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:15,330
Decor color!

2474
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:16,870
Okay.

2475
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:18,510
Basic flooring.

2476
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:20,210
Make it yellow.

2477
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:22,990
And then we'll make the furniture colors too.

2478
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:24,290
We gotta change the furniture color.

2479
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:25,070
Oh my!

2480
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:26,130
We are not changing!

2481
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:27,170
Okay.

2482
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,470
One of them.

2483
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:30,470
You get to be special.

2484
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:35,710
The one green chair.

2485
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,870
I'm not changing every chair, guys.

2486
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:44,090
I'm not doing every fucking chair.

2487
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:45,310
But like...

2488
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:46,010
This chair.

2489
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:47,490
This chair is special.

2490
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,250
Oh, we're getting rid of the cars.

2491
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:49,950
Actually.

2492
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:51,390
Let's get rid of the car.

2493
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,930
Sorry, man.

2494
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:55,290
I just realized...

2495
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:55,930
It just doesn't fit.

2496
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:56,790
I'm sorry.

2497
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:58,630
I'm sorry, guys.

2498
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:00,570
I know you love to be in this room.

2499
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:01,170
But like...

2500
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:01,810
Honestly...

2501
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:03,510
Who put this one white chair here?

2502
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:05,310
What the fuck are you doing here?

2503
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:10,190
But it was worth it.

2504
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:12,090
My 50...

2505
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:13,370
Holy shit!

2506
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,710
I went to get a drink.

2507
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:15,610
What happened?

2508
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:19,350
We have our room, guys.

2509
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:22,030
We have our room!

2510
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:27,690
We did it.

2511
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:28,430
Guys.

2512
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:30,850
Our feng shui is off the roof right now.

2513
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:36,490
There's a chair among us.

2514
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:38,030
Oh my god.

2515
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:40,090
After everything, we finally...

2516
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:42,550
This is why I pre-ordered Sand Land.

2517
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:46,670
This is exactly why I pre-ordered Sand Land.

2518
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:47,990
It was so worth it, guys.

2519
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:53,630
Finally!

2520
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,550
The pre-order was worth it.

2521
01:44:59,210 --> 01:44:59,670
Alright.

2522
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:03,070
Oh my god.

2523
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,010
I can finally put stickers.

2524
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:04,670
Okay.

2525
01:45:05,290 --> 01:45:05,750
Alright.

2526
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:07,810
Oh my god.

2527
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:08,750
Look at all these colors!

2528
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:10,230
Alright.

2529
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:10,870
What do I...

2530
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:11,930
What?

2531
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:12,250
Okay.

2532
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:12,490
Yellow.

2533
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:15,430
It has to be bright yellow so people will know I'm coming.

2534
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:16,970
So they'll know.

2535
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,790
They'll know I'm heading over.

2536
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:21,810
Oh.

2537
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:22,530
Okay.

2538
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:23,830
And then we'll put...

2539
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:23,910
Oh!

2540
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,170
We'll put blue like the hat?

2541
01:45:25,690 --> 01:45:26,690
And then what's this?

2542
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:27,270
Okay.

2543
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,370
And then the...

2544
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:30,350
The legs.

2545
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:31,250
Where's the legs?

2546
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:32,110
What is this?

2547
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,130
Oh.

2548
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:33,850
Option one.

2549
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:34,310
Okay.

2550
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:34,930
The legs.

2551
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:37,410
Oh wait.

2552
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:37,610
No.

2553
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:38,050
Never mind.

2554
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:38,750
This looks ugly.

2555
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:39,290
Okay.

2556
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,030
What?

2557
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:40,530
Decal!

2558
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,450
Oh my god!

2559
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:42,670
We can change our decal!

2560
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:44,330
Guys!

2561
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,510
Now they'll never...

2562
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:50,290
If only I could have changed it earlier and put 105 so people will know it's me.

2563
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:50,850
Oh!

2564
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:51,970
There's art too!

2565
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:53,990
There's logos!

2566
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:55,890
And then there's like...

2567
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:56,830
Oh there's actual numbers!

2568
01:45:57,710 --> 01:45:58,590
Oh my god!

2569
01:45:58,730 --> 01:45:59,130
Okay.

2570
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:00,310
I want to put art on it.

2571
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:00,890
Wait.

2572
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:01,230
Where can...

2573
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:01,890
Can I put it anywhere?

2574
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:03,390
Oh my god.

2575
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:03,610
Okay.

2576
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:04,670
I'm gonna put...

2577
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:05,990
Oh my god.

2578
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:08,210
We could be like...

2579
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:09,270
We could be like...

2580
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:09,430
Oh!

2581
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:11,170
There's a B.

2582
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,710
There's so many choices.

2583
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:14,090
What is this?

2584
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:15,110
Fucking basketball?

2585
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:15,850
Like what?

2586
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,810
This looks like a basketball logo.

2587
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:18,910
Okay.

2588
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:19,430
Uh.

2589
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:20,690
Alright.

2590
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,390
We're gonna do...

2591
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:22,330
Oh I wanna be...

2592
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:23,770
I wanna be a...

2593
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:24,550
I wanna be a...

2594
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:24,890
Oh my god.

2595
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:25,550
There's so many choices.

2596
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:26,450
Wait.

2597
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:27,090
There's a blue bird?

2598
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:27,910
Where's the blue bird?

2599
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:28,830
Oh you're right!

2600
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:29,370
There is!

2601
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:31,350
Wait.

2602
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:31,950
Where is it?

2603
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,430
Where does the decal go?

2604
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:36,910
Where does it go?

2605
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:37,290
Wait.

2606
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:38,610
I have to pay for this?

2607
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:39,250
I have to pay for this?

2608
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:39,750
Okay.

2609
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:40,490
That's fucked up.

2610
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,230
Not gonna lie.

2611
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:43,590
Where's the decal?

2612
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:49,230
My equipment may be hiding the decal?

2613
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,730
Oh my god.

2614
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:51,370
That's fucked up.

2615
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:53,350
That's actually fucked up.

2616
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:56,090
That's actually fucked up.

2617
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:00,150
No!

2618
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:03,930
Oh my god.

2619
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:07,010
I'll make sure everything has...

2620
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:07,990
I'll make sure...

2621
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,170
Okay.

2622
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:09,070
We're just gonna put it there.

2623
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:09,230
Okay.

2624
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:09,350
What the fuck.

2625
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:09,530
Where are you?

2626
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:11,430
No more eyes for you.

2627
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:17,330
You don't get eyes anymore.

2628
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,070
You don't get eyes.

2629
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:26,370
I need this decal somewhere.

2630
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:31,290
If it's the last...

2631
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:31,610
Oh shit.

2632
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:31,770
No.

2633
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:32,730
That's now why I wanted...

2634
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:33,830
I need...

2635
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:36,410
I need it somewhere if it's the last thing I do.

2636
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:37,850
Okay.

2637
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:38,370
Okay.

2638
01:47:39,070 --> 01:47:39,770
There we go.

2639
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:42,010
Okay, and then...

2640
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:43,230
Can I just hold it?

2641
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:45,730
Painting...

2642
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:46,970
Yes!

2643
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:49,070
I want that.

2644
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:49,990
Okay.

2645
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:52,630
I can't believe it.

2646
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:56,850
I can't believe my decal didn't even show up anywhere.

2647
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:58,450
Like, where the fuck you're...

2648
01:47:58,450 --> 01:48:01,270
I'm not gonna make this... I'm not gonna make the tank naked!

2649
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:04,890
I worked so hard to put this...

2650
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:07,490
I worked so hard!

2651
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:09,790
To get to this stage!

2652
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:14,730
Alright, alright.

2653
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:16,210
We just have...

2654
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:16,850
It's okay.

2655
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:18,030
This is all I wanted.

2656
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:19,950
There we go.

2657
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:20,770
It's beautiful.

2658
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:21,470
You're beautiful.

2659
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:23,650
You're so beautiful.

2660
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:25,090
Okay.

2661
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:25,870
Is that it?

2662
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:27,270
Do I just have to...

2663
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:28,670
Painting...

2664
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:29,650
Painted.

2665
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:30,130
Okay.

2666
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:32,550
Did I do it?

2667
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:34,270
I must have done it, right?

2668
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:35,750
Yeah!

2669
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,350
Everything's good!

2670
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:36,970
Alright.

2671
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:37,790
It's beautiful.

2672
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:40,410
Oh my god!

2673
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:41,530
Finally!

2674
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:42,870
Alright.

2675
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:44,410
Everything else, I really don't care.

2676
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:45,130
See you!

2677
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:48,650
Alright.

2678
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:50,070
Alright.

2679
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:50,830
Goodbye, town.

2680
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:52,110
I worked so hard.

2681
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:54,670
It only took two hours, guys.

2682
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:57,230
But we can finally leave.

2683
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:02,430
It only took two hours.

2684
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:05,750
But we can finally leave.

2685
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:07,950
And go to Greenland.

2686
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:11,270
And go to Greenland.

2687
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,150
Oh my god.

2688
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:12,610
Here we go!

2689
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:17,590
Off to Greenland we go.

2690
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:23,830
It was a journey.

2691
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:25,950
We're off to Greenland.

2692
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:28,990
Did I go the wrong way for Greenland?

2693
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:31,290
Fuck.

2694
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:32,570
How do I get there?

2695
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:35,830
Oh my god.

2696
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,470
We're finally gonna see the greens, guys.

2697
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:43,090
We're fi- Oh my god, wait, we have to kill him!

2698
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:47,370
We gotta make sure his- we keep- this species go endangered!

2699
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:51,650
Guys, it's a rare raptor!

2700
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:52,850
It's the P-Raptor!

2701
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:57,010
Alright, we're just gonna- oh my god.

2702
01:49:57,450 --> 01:49:59,930
Oh my god, Joki tanked in action.

2703
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:02,730
We'll let this guy live.

2704
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:03,890
We'll let the child live.

2705
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:07,510
The last white- it's like the last unicorn!

2706
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:14,270
But better, because I'm the one doing the kill- In game, in game.

2707
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:15,330
In game.

2708
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:17,650
Dark, thank you for the super chat.

2709
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:18,490
Thank you, thank you.

2710
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:23,790
This room reminds me of your dad's- of your old Minecraft clip where your inventory was- No!

2711
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:25,990
I was reading super chat.

2712
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:28,590
But I can- there's no web.

2713
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:29,470
Are you serious?

2714
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:31,110
We're sinking into the water.

2715
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:32,090
This won't work!

2716
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,710
Oh my god.

2717
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:38,410
Maybe finding- this was a mistake.

2718
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:41,870
Giving them water was a mistake.

2719
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:46,170
I should never have given them water.

2720
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:49,470
Where your inventory is so unorganized and destroy the OCD.

2721
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:51,910
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

2722
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:53,110
Thank you, thank you.

2723
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:55,290
Weeeee!

2724
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:56,830
Okay.

2725
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,490
I hope I'm going the right way with this.

2726
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,310
I went the wrong way?

2727
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:02,350
God damn it!

2728
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:05,070
I went the wrong way.

2729
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:08,350
I went the wrong way.

2730
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,890
I was supposed to hold- hold- wait, no, did I?

2731
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:16,010
Gosh, where is the- oh, I could just- I should have just fast traveled there.

2732
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,270
Giving the people water was a mistake.

2733
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:25,930
Okay, this way.

2734
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:28,010
Alright, now I'm closer.

2735
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:30,470
Yeah!

2736
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:32,710
I'm closer now.

2737
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,130
Guys, we have to head to Greenland.

2738
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,690
That's like our end goal.

2739
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:40,830
After everything.

2740
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:43,390
After all the quests we did.

2741
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:46,110
We have to progress the story.

2742
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:48,110
Alright, that peddler's gonna die.

2743
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:54,910
Immortal Joe was right.

2744
01:51:56,970 --> 01:51:58,470
Oh no, my nitro.

2745
01:51:59,270 --> 01:52:00,830
Discord nitro, where are you?

2746
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:05,630
You know they don't.

2747
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:07,790
Guys, okay, so like...

2748
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,430
In the past...

2749
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:13,770
In the past, Discord used to give out free nitro to content creators.

2750
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,530
So like, I thought they still do that.

2751
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,470
So I was like, hey, do you guys still give out free nitro?

2752
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:23,130
They're like, I'm sorry, Doki, we don't do that anymore.

2753
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:24,370
Hahaha!

2754
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:32,330
It doesn't hurt to ask!

2755
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:33,650
Like, they used to!

2756
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,210
Oh shit!

2757
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:39,350
In the old days.

2758
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:43,890
So now I pay for my own nitro.

2759
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:45,610
I'm just like you guys.

2760
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:47,150
See?

2761
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:48,530
I'm one with the people.

2762
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:51,410
Guys, it was a choice.

2763
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,390
I'm with the people.

2764
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:55,370
Just like all of you.

2765
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:58,830
I pay for my own nitro.

2766
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,890
Stay with us.

2767
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:01,790
Can you speak?

2768
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:02,990
Tell us what happened.

2769
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:04,690
I...

2770
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:06,370
I don't know.

2771
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:08,150
What happened?

2772
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,070
Sorry, I...

2773
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:11,410
Sorry, I was like...

2774
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,150
Gone for a long time.

2775
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:17,290
I know like one of your soldiers might have died because like I never came back.

2776
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:20,170
But after, you know, fixing up my town for...

2777
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:21,830
In two hours...

2778
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:22,670
Hahaha!

2779
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:23,510
Hahaha!

2780
01:53:24,450 --> 01:53:25,070
Hahaha!

2781
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:26,590
Hahaha!

2782
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:26,610
Hahaha!

2783
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,290
Now I'm here to actually do this quest.

2784
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:32,550
Some thieves had snuck onto the ship to raid the place.

2785
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:38,230
While we were chasing them, a mysterious armed group suddenly showed up.

2786
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:39,770
Oh shit, who?

2787
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:42,010
That's when the shooting started.

2788
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:46,150
And at some point in all the chaos, I got hit.

2789
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:47,350
Just on the arm?

2790
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:52,450
When it was all over, the ship's cargo ended up in that armed group's hands.

2791
01:53:53,730 --> 01:53:55,930
Thieves in a mysterious armed group.

2792
01:53:56,610 --> 01:53:58,370
Both after the ship's cargo?

2793
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:01,050
What did the ship's cargo have?

2794
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:03,750
Oh my god, did you guys see that one guy just lying on the ground dead?

2795
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:05,450
How long has this...

2796
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:05,850
Haha!

2797
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:07,230
Did you see that guy?

2798
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,650
How long has he been dead for?

2799
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:11,770
Oh my gosh, I've been gone for a while.

2800
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:15,910
Oh shit, I'm sorry man.

2801
01:54:16,330 --> 01:54:16,770
Hahaha!

2802
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:18,370
Look, I'm sorry.

2803
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:19,610
I had to paint my tank.

2804
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:21,150
And get chairs.

2805
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:21,590
Somebody help!

2806
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:22,370
I'm...

2807
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,470
I'm not with the Royalists!

2808
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:24,970
Calm yourself!

2809
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:26,390
We're on your side!

2810
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:28,210
You are?

2811
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:28,950
Oh!

2812
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:30,750
Oh, thank god he's alive!

2813
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:34,390
Did he just faint from relief?

2814
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:37,010
Oh my god, maybe he shouldn't be a soldier.

2815
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,610
What's this about Royalists?

2816
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:39,550
Yeah, who are the Royalists?

2817
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:42,450
Hello?

2818
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:43,590
Sandland soldier?

2819
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:44,610
Oh no!

2820
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:46,570
I don't wanna die!

2821
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:47,950
Don't be a little bitch!

2822
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:48,710
Get up!

2823
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:49,270
Just sit tight!

2824
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:50,850
Your wound isn't lethal!

2825
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:52,790
What wound?

2826
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:53,610
Hahaha!

2827
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:54,650
General Shiva!

2828
01:54:55,210 --> 01:54:56,850
Are you here to save us?

2829
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:59,290
That armed group that attacked you.

2830
01:54:59,370 --> 01:54:59,830
Where'd they go?

2831
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:00,330
Yeah, where'd they go?

2832
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,810
They split up.

2833
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:06,010
Half headed north and the other half south.

2834
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:10,510
Our leader gathered anyone who could fight and raced south.

2835
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:13,050
What in the world happened here?

2836
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:13,470
Yeah!

2837
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:14,990
No idea.

2838
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:17,610
In any case, let's get in touch with Ahri.

2839
01:55:18,090 --> 01:55:18,390
Okay.

2840
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:23,560
That wound that's definitely dead.

2841
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:25,520
He's not really there but can't show it to us.

2842
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:26,920
He's doing the football.

2843
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,600
The soccer strat.

2844
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:33,360
They got caught between a band of thieves and some armed group.

2845
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:36,060
Thieves and bandits?

2846
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,200
Who could they have been?

2847
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,900
Yeah, how could they steal from us?

2848
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:41,920
We just got water back!

2849
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,720
But the other groups are mystery.

2850
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:48,040
One soldier alluded to being mistaken for a Royalist.

2851
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:50,240
The fuck is a Royalist?

2852
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,140
General R?

2853
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:52,580
It's possible.

2854
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:55,520
That term refers to close allies of Zeyu and the King.

2855
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,880
Maybe the attackers mistook the battleship guards for Royalists.

2856
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:03,200
Which means they had a grudge against Zeyu.

2857
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:04,420
Makes sense.

2858
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,860
We're going after the armed group that fled to the north.

2859
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:11,260
Could you get in touch with the unit that headed south?

2860
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:13,080
Understood.

2861
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,740
I'll lead a unit myself as well.

2862
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:18,400
If things go well, we can pincer the group that fled north.

2863
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:19,760
Alright, let's beat the shit out of them.

2864
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:20,160
Sounds good.

2865
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,300
I'll be in touch.

2866
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:21,900
They can't steal from me.

2867
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,380
I'm here to steal.

2868
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:24,660
Thanks for your cooperation.

2869
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:30,100
Why did we just offer to go after a bunch of people we know are armed to the teeth?

2870
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,460
Because we have a tank.

2871
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,020
We can't let some unidentified armed group roam around freely.

2872
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:35,680
Yeah.

2873
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,460
I can't believe this.

2874
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:39,300
Here you go again.

2875
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,940
Dragging us into danger.

2876
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:45,640
How can we find them when all we know is they went north?

2877
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,240
That's good enough for me.

2878
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:49,480
Here we go.

2879
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:50,380
Alright, let's go.

2880
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,400
Yeah!

2881
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,200
Don't worry.

2882
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:58,380
I know I can never get lost.

2883
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,940
Okay, where's North?

2884
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,020
Don't worry.

2885
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,660
There's only one way I can go in this path.

2886
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,700
How can I get lost now?

2887
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:14,960
So when does the green start getting green?

2888
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:17,580
See?

2889
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,840
I know where North is.

2890
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,220
It's this way.

2891
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:30,260
What other way could it be?

2892
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,200
Start by observing them carefully.

2893
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:37,100
Knowing what they can do and what their weaknesses are will help you fight a...

2894
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:38,200
Is this this way?

2895
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,340
Give me a sec, guys.

2896
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:41,900
Is it?

2897
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,760
It has to be this way.

2898
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,240
I'll try that next time.

2899
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:49,700
Wait, where else am I supposed to go?

2900
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,200
Wait, what?

2901
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,420
And you go back?

2902
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,280
Guys.

2903
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,380
I might have went the wrong way.

2904
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:18,600
Guys, I know which way is the right way.

2905
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,680
I'm going to go this way.

2906
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,420
I never get lost.

2907
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:24,760
It's okay.

2908
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:25,940
I'm never lost.

2909
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,600
Guys...

2910
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,160
I went the right way.

2911
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:35,840
I just wanted to look at the dam.

2912
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:37,500
Just wanted to do a little sightseeing.

2913
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:41,600
Okay, there's an open door.

2914
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:46,240
I would assume we go through this door because we've never been there.

2915
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,860
I didn't know we have to stay in Sand Land.

2916
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:51,460
I thought we're gonna go to Green Land.

2917
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:54,560
Oh, and then we follow this.

2918
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,080
Yeah, see?

2919
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,080
We just follow this.

2920
01:58:58,380 --> 01:58:59,400
It's just that easy.

2921
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:01,860
Nice.

2922
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:07,470
Look, see?

2923
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,950
We just follow these tracks.

2924
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:13,270
Follow the yellow... giant yellow mark there.

2925
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:15,490
Thank God they put yellow here.

2926
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:19,030
Look, we're doing it.

2927
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:20,850
We're just following the...

2928
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:23,390
Wait, what the fuck?

2929
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:27,430
Wait, who killed these dinos and it's not me?

2930
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:32,250
Wait, they actually died?

2931
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:35,030
Oh my God, wait.

2932
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:37,090
There's death in this game?

2933
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:40,090
Wait, what?

2934
01:59:40,330 --> 01:59:43,570
Maybe they tried attacking the armed group and paid the price.

2935
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:47,590
Holy shit!

2936
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,110
They actually killed.

2937
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:55,810
Oh my God, there's several dead dinos here.

2938
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:01,730
Guys, every time I try to kill, they just run away.

2939
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:05,630
And being like, ooh, they're just fainted.

2940
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:07,450
Or, oh, they just got lost.

2941
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:12,350
Doki's just annoyed someone's taking her job.

2942
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:14,390
The forever E.

2943
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:17,710
I can't believe it.

2944
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:19,090
There's so many dead dinos!

2945
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:20,530
We should keep our distance from the army base unless necessary.

2946
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,990
You're taking my job!

2947
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:24,930
I bet they've got loads of loot in there!

2948
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:27,370
Can't argue with that.

2949
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,850
Oh shit!

2950
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:29,370
Somehow I doubt they'd take my meeting with shooters...

2951
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:30,090
Placoon here.

2952
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:33,330
This will be my last super chat for the stream.

2953
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:35,130
Aziah, thank you for the super chat!

2954
02:00:35,130 --> 02:00:35,810
Thank you!

2955
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:37,170
Thank you for all the help, too.

2956
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:44,590
Forestland is four dungeon crawls and one mandatory vehicle build away!

2957
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:45,970
Have fun!

2958
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:48,250
You mean I'm not going to head to Greenland?

2959
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:50,510
I don't want to go to Greenland!

2960
02:00:52,310 --> 02:00:54,810
Greenland is four dungeons away!

2961
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,250
Thank you for the super chat.

2962
02:00:58,290 --> 02:00:59,470
Thank you.

2963
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:01,610
No!

2964
02:01:01,610 --> 02:01:03,910
I can't clickbait you guys!

2965
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:13,110
Guys, no!

2966
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:14,610
We can't!

2967
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:18,310
No, I would have clickbaited you guys if I don't head to Greenland!

2968
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:24,870
Guys, no!

2969
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:27,370
I swear I'm not here to clickbait you guys!

2970
02:01:27,450 --> 02:01:29,210
We're gonna be in Greenland!

2971
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:38,930
He said off to Greenland, not that you'll be there.

2972
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:42,610
Oh shit, you're right.

2973
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:47,670
Oh shit.

2974
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:48,750
No!

2975
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:50,490
Don't destroy me!

2976
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:51,010
No!

2977
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:53,730
I literally just made the city!

2978
02:01:54,630 --> 02:01:56,770
Oh my god, that's so fucked up.

2979
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:59,430
No, I swear to god, I literally just made the town.

2980
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:01,290
I swear to god.

2981
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,890
Oh, it's still okay.

2982
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:06,710
Oh, thank god.

2983
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:09,150
Oh, thank god.

2984
02:02:10,590 --> 02:02:14,490
I would have been so mad if they destroyed Spino.

2985
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:16,170
I was freaking out for nothing.

2986
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:20,450
Not that it's like a worry to me.

2987
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:21,910
I worked so hard on those chairs.

2988
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:26,430
We should check in with her, just to make sure everything is alright.

2989
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:30,490
Alright.

2990
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:34,170
Broku, thank you for the super chat.

2991
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,110
Thank you, thank you.

2992
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:37,310
Alright.

2993
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:37,990
Alright, Anne.

2994
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:39,930
Wait, not Anne?

2995
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:40,730
Polack?

2996
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:42,330
Welcome back, everyone.

2997
02:02:42,610 --> 02:02:42,970
Hey, guys.

2998
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:44,590
It's just you?

2999
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:45,330
Where's Anne?

3000
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,910
Yeah, where's Anne?

3001
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:48,370
She went off to the Leesop Junker Market.

3002
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:50,850
To do some bargain hunting.

3003
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:52,350
Alone?

3004
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:53,310
Alone?

3005
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:54,230
Without us?

3006
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:55,350
But she's a...

3007
02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:56,470
She said the army is not our enemy anymore.

3008
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:59,270
She's a gadget in our Chip and Dale group.

3009
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:01,250
I see.

3010
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,230
Everybody needs one gadget.

3011
02:03:08,370 --> 02:03:08,890
Oh.

3012
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:09,410
Oh.

3013
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:10,330
Wait, what?

3014
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:12,690
What?

3015
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:13,650
It's a bit noisy out there.

3016
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:15,470
I wonder what's going on.

3017
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:17,310
That's the Junker from...

3018
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:19,070
I think it's coming from the town's entrance.

3019
02:03:19,450 --> 02:03:22,250
That's the Junker from the other town.

3020
02:03:22,990 --> 02:03:23,750
Is he okay?

3021
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:25,230
He can't be dead.

3022
02:03:25,290 --> 02:03:26,650
There's no dead people in this game.

3023
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:30,510
Hey, are you okay?

3024
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:31,550
There's apparently dead raptors.

3025
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:32,010
What happened to you?

3026
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:37,990
Shady guy.

3027
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:40,410
Wait, he walked all the way here?

3028
02:03:40,770 --> 02:03:41,190
Junker's Market.

3029
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:42,690
Junker's Market's so far.

3030
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:46,110
They know how to fight.

3031
02:03:46,650 --> 02:03:49,270
It took all I had in me just to run away.

3032
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:50,550
How did you run here?

3033
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:52,510
Old man.

3034
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:57,830
It could be the armed group.

3035
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,170
The... the market?

3036
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:03,330
But Ant's at the market now.

3037
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:03,710
Yeah.

3038
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:04,530
Ant's there.

3039
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:06,270
He fast traveled.

3040
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:10,950
You're not the only one that can fast travel, Doki.

3041
02:04:11,230 --> 02:04:12,490
You say that, but what do you mean?

3042
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:14,230
You're not the only one that can fast travel, Doki.

3043
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:15,770
We've got to, right?

3044
02:04:16,070 --> 02:04:16,510
Yeah.

3045
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:17,950
He's the gadget.

3046
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:18,570
She's the gadget.

3047
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:21,250
Let's hurry.

3048
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:25,850
So we have to find a new gadget and that's too much work.

3049
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:28,290
Okay.

3050
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:31,150
Or wait, Pollock's... Pollock's also a woman.

3051
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:32,650
We can replace her.

3052
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:35,430
We can replace her with Pollock.

3053
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:38,330
Her new alien wife.

3054
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:45,230
Alright, let's go.

3055
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,030
Let's fast travel.

3056
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:50,350
We can fast travel!

3057
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:52,510
Oh my, that's so fucked up.

3058
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:54,110
Oh, thank God.

3059
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:55,370
I was gonna say...

3060
02:04:57,470 --> 02:05:02,070
I was gonna say, are you gonna actually make me fucking walk all the way there?

3061
02:05:02,890 --> 02:05:04,630
I would have been so sad.

3062
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:06,290
Okay, this way.

3063
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,090
Yay.

3064
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:13,450
Yay.

3065
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:16,830
Okay, we're gonna have to head to...

3066
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:17,590
This way.

3067
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:17,810
This way, right?

3068
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:19,170
Am I going the right way?

3069
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:19,790
Yeah.

3070
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:22,330
I just don't know if I'm going the right way.

3071
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,030
Okay.

3072
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:35,790
Is everybody okay?

3073
02:05:36,190 --> 02:05:38,610
Is that good fire or bad fire?

3074
02:05:39,450 --> 02:05:40,170
Hey, they're alive.

3075
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:43,090
Doesn't seem too bad.

3076
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:43,810
You guys are alive!

3077
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:45,590
It's you guys!

3078
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:47,590
Did you come to save us?

3079
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:48,810
Yeah!

3080
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:50,550
I'm looking for a young woman named Anne.

3081
02:05:50,630 --> 02:05:50,850
No!

3082
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:51,630
Did you see her?

3083
02:05:51,670 --> 02:05:52,630
We're only here for Anne.

3084
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:54,430
A woman.

3085
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:56,110
A woman?

3086
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:57,130
I don't even know who you mean.

3087
02:05:58,030 --> 02:05:58,830
A woman.

3088
02:05:59,390 --> 02:06:00,490
Do you know where she is?

3089
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:02,390
Yeah.

3090
02:06:02,830 --> 02:06:07,950
The bad guys were headed toward the Lysa battleship and she... she chased after them.

3091
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:09,170
She what?

3092
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:11,210
Oh my God, she's crazy.

3093
02:06:11,390 --> 02:06:12,610
Why did she wait for us?

3094
02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:13,030
Is she her mom?

3095
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:13,190
Yeah.

3096
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:17,350
She could have waited for us.

3097
02:06:17,390 --> 02:06:17,570
She's a good girl.

3098
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:18,830
Okay, we got to find Anne.

3099
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:22,770
Alright, off we go.

3100
02:06:23,230 --> 02:06:24,750
Time to find Anne.

3101
02:06:25,270 --> 02:06:25,970
I'm sad.

3102
02:06:26,110 --> 02:06:27,270
We can't use our bike yet.

3103
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:29,330
Okay, now we can.

3104
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:29,970
Here we go.

3105
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:34,770
Alright, time to rescue Anne.

3106
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:36,270
Battleship cave.

3107
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:38,170
Is there people in the...

3108
02:06:38,170 --> 02:06:39,630
Oh shit!

3109
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:41,810
I can't believe it!

3110
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:43,650
A sledge stopped me?

3111
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:45,690
Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.

3112
02:06:45,690 --> 02:06:46,350
We have to climb.

3113
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:47,550
We have to climb.

3114
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:48,390
It doesn't matter.

3115
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:51,270
Off we go.

3116
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:53,650
We gotta climb anyway.

3117
02:06:55,010 --> 02:06:56,210
So far.

3118
02:06:56,950 --> 02:07:00,790
Why didn't we build a fast travel system in this cave?

3119
02:07:04,170 --> 02:07:04,890
Alright.

3120
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:07,890
Give me that mat.

3121
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:09,450
I need that mat.

3122
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:11,890
Give me that material.

3123
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:15,790
I need to upgrade our dragoon ship.

3124
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:17,330
Okay.

3125
02:07:17,330 --> 02:07:24,730
Oh my god, I forgot how fucking tall this mountain is.

3126
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:25,890
There she is!

3127
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:30,050
Wait, they wear real helmets!

3128
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:31,370
Where are you from?

3129
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:34,350
You better stand back, doll!

3130
02:07:35,190 --> 02:07:35,790
Whoa!

3131
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,870
Whoa!

3132
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:44,730
Oh my god, they wear real uniforms compared to the ones we had to face.

3133
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:46,590
Cut the crap and answer me!

3134
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:46,990
Okay.

3135
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:48,870
Hands off you!

3136
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,270
Damn.

3137
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:54,970
Don't make me bring the tank out.

3138
02:07:55,590 --> 02:07:56,150
Hey!

3139
02:07:56,150 --> 02:07:57,030
You guys back off too!

3140
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:57,670
More!

3141
02:07:57,850 --> 02:07:58,370
Or what?

3142
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:03,390
Look at them, thief.

3143
02:08:03,730 --> 02:08:05,830
They're totally scared of us!

3144
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:10,550
Come on, let's have some fun with this!

3145
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:13,670
Hear me, puny human!

3146
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:16,110
I am the great Beelzebub!

3147
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:16,990
Yeah, that's me.

3148
02:08:17,210 --> 02:08:17,310
I am the great Beelzebub!

3149
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:24,670
Yeah, if I touch you, you die.

3150
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:27,090
They don't know anything about demons.

3151
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:30,550
What the fuck?

3152
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:32,050
I have a tail!

3153
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:34,910
Is that not scary enough?

3154
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:37,230
I'm literally pink!

3155
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:39,390
So what if he's a demon?

3156
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:41,170
He's still just a kid.

3157
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:43,090
Whoa!

3158
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:44,230
Hey!

3159
02:08:44,230 --> 02:08:45,670
Take the girl and get lost!

3160
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:47,790
If you know what's good for you.

3161
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:48,730
I have horns?

3162
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:49,830
Hold up.

3163
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:53,150
Can you imagine what the brass bag homies say if we kill the demon?

3164
02:08:53,150 --> 02:08:55,050
Pink is so scary to me.

3165
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:57,910
You're right.

3166
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:01,050
We might even get promoted.

3167
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:07,210
This is our lucky point.

3168
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:09,250
I mean, he could just lie and sit at Kill Bill.

3169
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:10,770
Oh shit!

3170
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:11,570
Those are horns!

3171
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:13,230
Sorry, it looked like hair.

3172
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:18,490
It actually looked like hair.

3173
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:19,210
I couldn't tell.

3174
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:24,390
Watch this.

3175
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:33,420
Not overkill!

3176
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:34,800
Boom!

3177
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:37,020
Boom!

3178
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:38,820
Boom!

3179
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:41,580
Oh yeah!

3180
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:46,740
How could this block a fucking tank?

3181
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:47,640
Nice.

3182
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,180
I'm done.

3183
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:52,780
A demon and his tank.

3184
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:56,120
Wait.

3185
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:57,140
Where are you going?

3186
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:01,500
I have to do this!

3187
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:01,900
Do what?

3188
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:02,860
You just got here.

3189
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,500
You don't even know what's going on, Anne!

3190
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:06,540
What are you talking about?

3191
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:06,840
Yeah!

3192
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:10,120
Please, just let me go!

3193
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:12,620
There's something I have to make sure of!

3194
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:13,660
What?

3195
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,320
Make sure of what?

3196
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,580
She's hiding something from us.

3197
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:20,120
You would hide from the team?

3198
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:20,980
But we're family!

3199
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:25,340
Oh, it has something to do with her necklace!

3200
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:26,500
Oh, it has something to do with her necklace!

3201
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:28,100
But the three of us are coming with you.

3202
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,480
Why would you do that?

3203
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:37,900
Because you're one of us.

3204
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:38,860
Right, Prince?

3205
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:39,520
Because you're one of us.

3206
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:39,520
Right, Prince?

3207
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:39,520
Yeah!

3208
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:43,040
You're the boomer slash gadget of the group!

3209
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:44,120
Whatever.

3210
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:45,000
We always need one!

3211
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:48,300
But please run if it gets dangerous, okay?

3212
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:51,560
Dangerous?

3213
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,020
For me?

3214
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,680
Come on, let's go!

3215
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:56,940
Alright.

3216
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:58,280
Let's go.

3217
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:00,760
Dungeon number one.

3218
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:06,300
What are the three dungeons?

3219
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:08,040
Great.

3220
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,940
Then where did they disappear to?

3221
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:11,100
They disappeared to...

3222
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:16,840
Last time we were here, we used a different exit to escape.

3223
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:20,400
They probably headed in that direction.

3224
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:26,380
They probably headed in that direction.

3225
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:27,520
I can't believe it.

3226
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:29,720
We don't instantly head to Greenland.

3227
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:32,060
We have to work for it?

3228
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:34,100
This is bullshit.

3229
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:36,440
Oh my god, do I actually have to blow this fence up?

3230
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:37,460
Here we go!

3231
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:40,700
What the fuck?

3232
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:44,120
Are you telling me I have to jump over this?

3233
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:45,280
Oh my god!

3234
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,200
That's... okay.

3235
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:48,360
No?

3236
02:11:49,870 --> 02:11:50,820
It's a fence!

3237
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:00,000
How can we not jump over it?

3238
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:17,800
What the fuck?

3239
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:22,700
How is that fence...

3240
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:25,480
How is that fence so difficult?

3241
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:31,720
Why is jumping forbidden?

3242
02:12:33,740 --> 02:12:35,100
This is fucked up.

3243
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:36,340
I caught bullshit.

3244
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:38,720
I caught actual bullshit.

3245
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:43,060
There's no way!

3246
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:43,380
There's no way!

3247
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:47,320
Alright, we gotta find the other entrance.

3248
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:49,460
How the fuck do I get to the other entrance?

3249
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:50,880
Alright.

3250
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:54,300
Apparently this fence is too strong for me.

3251
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,860
And I'm lost again.

3252
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:57,920
Okay, here it is.

3253
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:08,160
Oh, it's here.

3254
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:10,660
Can I jump over that?

3255
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:11,760
What kind of answer is that?

3256
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:14,620
There's no way I can jump over that.

3257
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:15,340
Right?

3258
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:17,040
Oh, I can!

3259
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,000
Broko, thank you for the super chat.

3260
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:20,840
Thank you, thank you.

3261
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,440
There's no way I can jump over that.

3262
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:26,460
While in jump bot, hold A for a big jump.

3263
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:30,820
Look, I didn't know it looked so high.

3264
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:34,880
I can't believe it.

3265
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:38,160
Yeah, I can't fucking jump over the fence.

3266
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:40,120
Like, what?

3267
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:44,700
First Zeyu's ship, now the Li Sa battleship.

3268
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:45,660
What?

3269
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:46,600
What are they after?

3270
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:50,900
I cannot jump over a fence, but I can jump over that.

3271
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,360
I cannot jump over a fence, but I can jump over that.

3272
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:52,800
I cannot jump over a fence, but I can jump over that.

3273
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,660
Something so valuable, they'd even take on the royal army to get their hands on it.

3274
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:57,160
Something so valuable, they'd even take on the royal army to get their hands on it.

3275
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,240
It's just too high, Doki.

3276
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:01,600
It's just too high, Doki.

3277
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:02,860
You don't understand.

3278
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:04,860
Hey, is that what we were looking for?

3279
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,640
Thank you for the super chat.

3280
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,500
Thank you, thank you.

3281
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:08,100
Oh no.

3282
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:14,500
No, Ching Ling friends, if only we have a large tank like vehicle or demon who is trying to pick up a tank.

3283
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:15,360
They likely headed this way.

3284
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:16,820
Let's take a look.

3285
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:24,180
It's out of respect for any engineer who installed it.

3286
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:25,500
Here we go.

3287
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:27,220
Nice, we got that.

3288
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:28,660
Oh, there's more mats.

3289
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:32,800
Okay.

3290
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:33,820
Grab some- Woo!

3291
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:37,440
That's a nice engine I got.

3292
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:39,080
Ooh!

3293
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:41,320
I love free stuff.

3294
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,400
Okay, we gotta go this way.

3295
02:14:48,490 --> 02:14:49,790
And we have to go up.

3296
02:14:49,850 --> 02:14:51,730
Wait, there's- Oh wait, I thought those were dead people.

3297
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:54,590
This is where we first ran into that guard bot.

3298
02:14:54,850 --> 02:14:55,250
Yeah!

3299
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:57,350
I remember.

3300
02:14:57,830 --> 02:15:01,310
It's where the prince fell on his- Fell on my what?

3301
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:02,610
What?

3302
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:03,510
Fell on my what?

3303
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:04,650
Finish that sentence!

3304
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:06,210
Fucking coward.

3305
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:10,170
Don't have the balls to say it to my face.

3306
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:14,550
Kiss this way and then to your left.

3307
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:16,450
To the left, to the left!

3308
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:18,710
Speed.

3309
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:21,130
This door is open too!

3310
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:23,530
Oh yeah, this door wasn't open before.

3311
02:15:25,370 --> 02:15:26,230
Weird smell.

3312
02:15:30,370 --> 02:15:30,930
Weird smell?

3313
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:30,970
Weird smell?

3314
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:31,350
What weird smell?

3315
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:33,090
What is it, prince?

3316
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:37,750
It looks like the stairs just keep going up.

3317
02:15:37,750 --> 02:15:38,690
Woah!

3318
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:43,970
Oh, and then we're gonna have like a finding hole to place the necklace in.

3319
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:45,790
The fuck?

3320
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:48,690
At least that was sort of fun.

3321
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:49,930
What is he doing here?

3322
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:51,230
Get out of here.

3323
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:52,970
Get out of here!

3324
02:15:53,590 --> 02:15:55,150
Get out of my 2D platform!

3325
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:57,690
That's fucking right.

3326
02:15:57,890 --> 02:15:58,850
We're gonna do...

3327
02:15:59,550 --> 02:15:59,810
Nothing!

3328
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:03,410
I feel like I remember that coming up.

3329
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:05,230
Alright.

3330
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:06,750
Nice.

3331
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:10,830
Yeah, what are the loyalists?

3332
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:10,850
Yeah, what are the loyalists?

3333
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:12,970
I see.

3334
02:16:13,110 --> 02:16:13,470
No!

3335
02:16:15,530 --> 02:16:17,190
Sorry, I got...

3336
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:18,710
I got a bit distracted.

3337
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:20,070
It's so...

3338
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:23,750
The holes are like very camouflaged.

3339
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:28,270
So like, you zone out for one second and you can't see it.

3340
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:39,150
Woah, who's he?

3341
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:44,590
What the fuck is this guy?

3342
02:16:46,550 --> 02:16:46,850
What the fuck is this guy?

3343
02:16:46,850 --> 02:16:49,190
Are you quite sure you checked everywhere?

3344
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:51,070
Bro, your neck is okay?

3345
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,990
Yes, sir!

3346
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:56,090
Please, believe me.

3347
02:16:56,270 --> 02:16:57,110
General Happy...

3348
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:57,870
Oh my god, it's Tenjin!

3349
02:16:59,490 --> 02:17:00,050
Hmm...

3350
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:05,010
If that's the case, then it must be in the engine room.

3351
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:07,550
Happy?

3352
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:08,130
Happy?

3353
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:09,890
I knew it!

3354
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:11,190
Happy?

3355
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:13,290
Who?

3356
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:17,070
What's this?

3357
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:20,310
I think I spy some sneaky little rats.

3358
02:17:20,970 --> 02:17:22,190
Oh, that's me!

3359
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,250
I'm rat!

3360
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:24,810
Bring them before me!

3361
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:25,970
Wait, they have guns though.

3362
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:27,590
Yes, sir!

3363
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:30,290
Are those like night vision goggles?

3364
02:17:30,690 --> 02:17:31,990
But it's not even night.

3365
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:35,670
Damn it!

3366
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:36,930
Too late to run now.

3367
02:17:36,930 --> 02:17:39,010
Looks like we're in for a rough fight.

3368
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:39,130
Don't worry.

3369
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:46,210
This very fragile bridge can handle the tank.

3370
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:47,810
Boo!

3371
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:54,290
Don't worry!

3372
02:17:55,270 --> 02:18:00,130
Surely this tank is not going to fucking blow up!

3373
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:01,450
Surely!

3374
02:18:07,870 --> 02:18:10,930
How pathetic of you to lose to the lights of an old demon!

3375
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:12,390
It barely even is!

3376
02:18:15,610 --> 02:18:16,210
Hey!

3377
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:17,230
Where did you go?

3378
02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:19,590
A perfectly tank-sized catwalk!

3379
02:18:20,410 --> 02:18:20,410
Hey!

3380
02:18:20,510 --> 02:18:20,510
Where did you go?

3381
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:23,050
Hmm...

3382
02:18:23,050 --> 02:18:29,230
It seems that demons lack not only any semblance of intellect, but a sense of humor as well.

3383
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:30,110
Whoa!

3384
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:31,810
What the heck is that supposed to mean?

3385
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:32,490
That's not fair!

3386
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:36,010
Mom says I'm just special.

3387
02:18:36,330 --> 02:18:36,630
Mom says I'm just special.

3388
02:18:36,930 --> 02:18:37,450
Whoa!

3389
02:18:38,030 --> 02:18:39,770
Okay, this bridge should...

3390
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:41,090
Alright, you know...

3391
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:43,850
I don't think this bridge would fit this.

3392
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:45,110
Guys!

3393
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:47,410
I think my bridge is about to collapse.

3394
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:50,390
Guys!

3395
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:50,390
I think my bridge is about to collapse.

3396
02:18:51,210 --> 02:18:51,430
Okay!

3397
02:18:52,710 --> 02:18:56,090
What material is this bridge made of?

3398
02:18:56,990 --> 02:18:57,310
What material is this bridge made of?

3399
02:18:57,850 --> 02:18:59,350
What material is this bridge made of?

3400
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,930
They've brought their tank...

3401
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:12,940
What the fuck on durability is this bridge?

3402
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:25,100
Yeah, just tank the missile.

3403
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:43,900
Oh my god, throw them off the bridge!

3404
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:47,080
If you're evil, you do it, because I do it.

3405
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,460
I mean, I'm not evil.

3406
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:50,340
I'm just roleplaying.

3407
02:19:59,260 --> 02:19:59,660
Bro,

3408
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:05,480
throw them off the bridge!

3409
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:08,180
Oh my god, bro, these soldiers are so fucking stupid.

3410
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:08,920
Like...

3411
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:10,420
It's literally there.

3412
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:14,940
You can literally throw them off.

3413
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:17,140
At least throw the humans off.

3414
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:20,540
Like they're like, oh but what if it causes bad luck?

3415
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:21,440
Then throw the people!

3416
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:26,600
Like throw the people off!

3417
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:28,220
Yeah, they're superstitious about the demon.

3418
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:30,220
Then what about the regular people?

3419
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:31,920
Just throw them off the bridge!

3420
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:44,720
Let's follow them.

3421
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:46,980
I don't feel comfortable leaving them alone.

3422
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:52,020
They said something about- Oh hey, there's my bra tank!

3423
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:55,560
There's my tank right there.

3424
02:20:57,420 --> 02:21:01,120
Never throw people off the bridge if you're not on the fly.

3425
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:04,940
Do you know this half-stache guy?

3426
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:08,060
Yeah, but not that well.

3427
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:09,400
How do you know her?

3428
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:09,960
Or him?

3429
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:12,900
What was that bot of his?

3430
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:15,860
I'm not sure myself.

3431
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:19,140
Thought you'd know.

3432
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:24,080
Alright, let's go up.

3433
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:25,600
We gotta go up.

3434
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:27,720
Go up the ladder.

3435
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:29,740
And we have to go this way.

3436
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:32,600
Whoa!

3437
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,540
Okay, don't worry.

3438
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:36,200
I got my tank.

3439
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:37,040
Sweet!

3440
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,040
My perfectly placed tank.

3441
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:40,860
Oh shit, no.

3442
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,140
We just gotta use this.

3443
02:21:43,220 --> 02:21:44,620
What's my HP on my tank?

3444
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:45,480
Okay, good enough.

3445
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:49,500
And then we'll- Oh wait, the little pew-pew-pew gun.

3446
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:51,080
It works just fine.

3447
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:54,340
Easy!

3448
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,360
So fucking easy.

3449
02:21:58,800 --> 02:21:59,640
Do I need more?

3450
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:02,920
Oh, we have to blow this up.

3451
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:05,820
Okay, and then...

3452
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:07,940
Gotta grab some mats up top.

3453
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:10,180
I see materials up top.

3454
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:11,620
Oh no.

3455
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,380
Do I need a jump bot?

3456
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:14,920
Am I too short?

3457
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:16,760
No, wait.

3458
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:18,380
Okay, we needed that anyway.

3459
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,300
Is there like an easier- No, I'm too short!

3460
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,660
I actually have to get a jump bot!

3461
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:28,100
Okay.

3462
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:31,860
X while jumping in jump bot?

3463
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:32,640
What does that mean?

3464
02:22:41,740 --> 02:22:42,400
That's awkward.

3465
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:45,280
Okay.

3466
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,440
Alright, alright.

3467
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:46,960
Okay.

3468
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:50,220
I don't know what to do with this information now.

3469
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:52,440
Wait, what did it look like?

3470
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:57,880
What did it look like, guys, to do that?

3471
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:00,280
Okay.

3472
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:02,240
Gonna destroy this first.

3473
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:05,200
Is there like extra materials down here?

3474
02:23:05,900 --> 02:23:07,520
Why did it take me down here?

3475
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:10,120
What?

3476
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:12,520
What's this- Oh there it is!

3477
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:12,880
There it is!

3478
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:14,980
Okay.

3479
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,700
There is extra materials.

3480
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,320
I was gonna say, I was like, why am I down here?

3481
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:21,120
There it is!

3482
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:22,960
Dude, look at all the extra materials!

3483
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:24,320
All the extra mats!

3484
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:26,340
Woop!

3485
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:27,580
There you go.

3486
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:29,200
Nice.

3487
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:31,920
We got the parallel twin engine.

3488
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:35,300
I assume that's like gonna make me, uh...

3489
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:37,060
Go faster on my bike.

3490
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:37,500
I assume I'm gonna have to do this.

3491
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:37,740
I assume.

3492
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:40,000
Okay, then jump!

3493
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:42,480
Jump!

3494
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,020
Oh shit!

3495
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:44,480
Oh thank god!

3496
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:45,320
Thank god there's yellow!

3497
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:49,980
Guys, I love it when there's yellow on boxes so I know where to go.

3498
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:54,660
Okay, nice!

3499
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:57,240
We got the fire ammo!

3500
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,740
Alright, how do I get up?

3501
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:06,340
Alright, up I go!

3502
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:09,980
Up I go!

3503
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:11,380
Yay!

3504
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:14,540
Oh, there's more containers!

3505
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:15,720
Nice!

3506
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:16,880
Okay, now get off the bike.

3507
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:19,140
I can't drive on the bridge.

3508
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:22,020
I'm so bad at driving.

3509
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:26,200
I don't really need to use it, but I'll just do it just cause.

3510
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:29,000
Oh, we need to tank again.

3511
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:34,200
And then we need to blow this up.

3512
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:36,360
The bike is too fast, yeah.

3513
02:24:37,340 --> 02:24:38,900
It's way too fast for me.

3514
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:44,480
The yellow paint is for game trend list.

3515
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:45,740
Here it is.

3516
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,620
I'm glad this game knows me well.

3517
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,480
No name!

3518
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:49,500
Thank you for the super chat!

3519
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:49,800
Thank you!

3520
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:52,520
That's right, and I'm proud of it.

3521
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:58,600
Guys, if it wasn't for the yellow paint, we would be here forever, guys.

3522
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:03,240
And we don't want that.

3523
02:25:03,560 --> 02:25:07,020
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but we don't want to be here forever.

3524
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:10,000
Wait, there's no loot here?

3525
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,740
Dude, I assume they would put like an empty box here.

3526
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:17,940
Hi Army IGN.

3527
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:20,640
I'll give you the best reviews ever.

3528
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:23,700
Okay, I feel like tank is better.

3529
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,740
The tank definitely causes more damage.

3530
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:28,500
There you go.

3531
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:30,520
And then...

3532
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:34,080
Oh my God, I just hit him and then he fucking fell off.

3533
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,460
And then...

3534
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:37,220
Bye.

3535
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:38,480
Is that it?

3536
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:39,740
No, there's one more.

3537
02:25:40,860 --> 02:25:44,700
My tank literally just poked him once and he just collapsed.

3538
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:46,660
That's actually so sad.

3539
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:49,280
Okay, reloading.

3540
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:50,940
Do I need a loot?

3541
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:52,840
Loot, loot, loot, loot.

3542
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:55,240
No?

3543
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:56,720
Alright, we'll just ride on.

3544
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:58,300
One tap.

3545
02:25:58,380 --> 02:25:59,760
Yeah, he got one tapped so badly.

3546
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:02,960
And...

3547
02:26:03,660 --> 02:26:04,620
Back here.

3548
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,460
Oh shit, that's a bomb!

3549
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:07,860
Okay, nice.

3550
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:08,260
Okay.

3551
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:09,700
We didn't get bombed.

3552
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:12,540
Okay, and then loot.

3553
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:15,000
No, no, get away from me!

3554
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:15,460
Get away from me!

3555
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:15,920
Get away from me!

3556
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:16,540
Oh, okay.

3557
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,460
Okay, we're gonna have to use a gun.

3558
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:23,760
It's so difficult to shoot that.

3559
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:26,920
Do I need to loot that mist?

3560
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:27,660
No.

3561
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:28,440
Alright, we're good.

3562
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:29,460
Matthew!

3563
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:31,040
Welcome to the tomato farm!

3564
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:31,780
Welcome, welcome!

3565
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:34,080
Hey.

3566
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:36,160
It's okay.

3567
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:36,940
We're fine.

3568
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:39,080
Oh shit!

3569
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:39,540
Oh shit!

3570
02:26:40,220 --> 02:26:40,600
Oh shit!

3571
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:40,980
No!

3572
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:42,540
Okay.

3573
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:44,080
I didn't miss, guys.

3574
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:45,900
It was planned.

3575
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:46,800
Oh, guys!

3576
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:48,760
Guys, let me see where you are!

3577
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:50,220
Nice.

3578
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:51,440
He's dead.

3579
02:26:53,420 --> 02:26:53,980
Yeah!

3580
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:54,740
Leveled up!

3581
02:26:57,620 --> 02:26:58,640
We did it!

3582
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:01,440
I assume it's this way.

3583
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:04,320
Aim, don't go...

3584
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,960
They're dead?

3585
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:06,760
They're still dead!

3586
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:08,660
So technically I aimed correctly.

3587
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:10,880
Yeah!

3588
02:27:11,240 --> 02:27:12,640
That's the crane we saw last time.

3589
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:14,360
Wait, what?

3590
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:19,200
Oh, for, uh, the guard bot we killed last time?

3591
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:22,300
Oh, we have to... we have to shoot that.

3592
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:22,660
Okay.

3593
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:26,020
Okay.

3594
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:27,800
Where is it?

3595
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:29,760
We gotta shoot this.

3596
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:32,220
There we go.

3597
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:33,740
And then we shoot that.

3598
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:36,240
And then we can get off.

3599
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:40,020
Holy shit.

3600
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:40,640
This is...

3601
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,620
I don't know if I can call this a dungeon...

3602
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:42,880
Dungeon.

3603
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:47,040
It's very straightforward.

3604
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,660
Not gonna lie.

3605
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:53,300
I wouldn't say this is a dungeon.

3606
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:58,880
This way.

3607
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:03,100
I think it's also because I've done this dungeon before.

3608
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:05,080
Get away!

3609
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:08,100
Nice.

3610
02:28:08,580 --> 02:28:09,060
Yeah.

3611
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:13,780
I think it's like I've done this part already before.

3612
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:16,020
So I don't really see this as a dungeon.

3613
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:18,380
Oh my gosh.

3614
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:20,400
It counts!

3615
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:22,320
Wait, yellow paint!

3616
02:28:23,020 --> 02:28:24,560
Why does it want me to go here?

3617
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:30,880
Oh my god, there's yellow paint.

3618
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:34,760
There's yellow paint.

3619
02:28:35,380 --> 02:28:37,040
That means there should be loot.

3620
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:38,080
I'm gonna go to the other side.

3621
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:40,920
I know there's a quest over there, but the yellow paint, guys!

3622
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:43,440
We can't just ignore the yellow paint!

3623
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:46,240
We gotta follow the paint, guys!

3624
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:49,720
Oh shit, wrong one.

3625
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:52,920
Wait, the yellow paint stopped.

3626
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:54,380
Oh no.

3627
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:55,940
Oh wait, there's loot!

3628
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:02,100
Guys, what do you do when the yellow paint stops?

3629
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:03,360
Guys...

3630
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:07,940
Oh no.

3631
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:11,460
I'm so lost without my yellow paint!

3632
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,720
It's the worst thing that could happen to me!

3633
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:21,620
When there's no more yellow paint!

3634
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:24,840
What do I do?

3635
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:28,440
Do I go...

3636
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:29,960
this way?

3637
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,820
Is there extra loot?

3638
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:35,900
Am I going the right way?

3639
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:37,400
I can't tell!

3640
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:39,840
Oh, I'm gonna go this way.

3641
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:40,240
I'm gonna get lost.

3642
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:46,990
It has to be this way, because there's so many enemies out of nowhere.

3643
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:53,170
Yeah, it has to be this way.

3644
02:29:54,270 --> 02:29:57,190
So that means there has to be like a boss here or something.

3645
02:29:58,530 --> 02:29:58,970
Follow...

3646
02:29:58,970 --> 02:29:59,690
Oh, the yellow light!

3647
02:29:59,990 --> 02:30:00,690
You're right!

3648
02:30:01,210 --> 02:30:02,730
We gotta follow the yellow light!

3649
02:30:05,250 --> 02:30:05,690
Alright.

3650
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:09,910
Oh, there's loot!

3651
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:10,270
There's loot!

3652
02:30:10,770 --> 02:30:11,630
Wait, that's it?

3653
02:30:12,750 --> 02:30:15,110
I did all of that for this one box?

3654
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:15,970
There's no way!

3655
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:17,190
There has to be more!

3656
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:19,170
There has to be...

3657
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:20,650
Oh, it's the rusty thing!

3658
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:25,510
Wait, it's rusty!

3659
02:30:25,710 --> 02:30:27,370
Wait, it's rusty!

3660
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,870
I knew it!

3661
02:30:30,370 --> 02:30:33,870
Guys, I don't know how to get back, but guys, think about the loot though!

3662
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,990
Okay.

3663
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:39,050
Let's see...

3664
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:40,950
Oh my god, look at all this loot!

3665
02:30:42,430 --> 02:30:43,990
This is everything we worked for!

3666
02:30:46,310 --> 02:30:48,910
And we got a heat upgraded gun?!

3667
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:50,170
Nice.

3668
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:53,390
Alright.

3669
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:55,830
We did it.

3670
02:30:57,170 --> 02:30:58,650
We worked so hard for this.

3671
02:30:59,470 --> 02:30:59,950
Wheeee!

3672
02:31:01,390 --> 02:31:02,570
Alright, off we go.

3673
02:31:02,590 --> 02:31:05,170
Okay, back to the main quest line now.

3674
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:07,730
The loot goblin mode.

3675
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:09,630
Guys, we need to upgrade our tanks!

3676
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:11,870
Guys, we need to upgrade our tanks!

3677
02:31:12,490 --> 02:31:14,110
Now back to the main quest.

3678
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:16,050
If I can remember how to get there.

3679
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:18,310
Okay, we gotta keep jumping.

3680
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:21,170
There's someone down there.

3681
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:22,130
Yeah, that's my team!

3682
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:25,810
Because they're not allowed to ride in the same car as me.

3683
02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:26,030
Because they're not allowed to ride in the same car as me.

3684
02:31:26,030 --> 02:31:26,690
So I make them walk.

3685
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:32,710
Oh, this way.

3686
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:32,990
Oh, this way.

3687
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:34,810
Oh, there's the yellow lights.

3688
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:38,510
Marsha, thank you for the super chat!

3689
02:31:38,570 --> 02:31:39,170
Thank you, thank you!

3690
02:31:39,210 --> 02:31:40,470
I can't call this a dungeon.

3691
02:31:40,530 --> 02:31:41,230
It's too straightforward.

3692
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:44,030
It gets lost in me easily.

3693
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:46,450
That's different, guys!

3694
02:31:46,730 --> 02:31:47,430
That's different!

3695
02:31:49,970 --> 02:31:51,070
Thank you for the super chat.

3696
02:31:51,170 --> 02:31:51,950
Thank you, thank you!

3697
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:53,250
Wait, is it this way?

3698
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:54,930
Oh, shit, guys.

3699
02:31:56,370 --> 02:31:57,190
I don't know.

3700
02:31:58,450 --> 02:31:59,810
Guys, where did I come from?

3701
02:31:59,890 --> 02:32:00,530
Oh, here, here, here!

3702
02:32:00,710 --> 02:32:01,670
This was the yellow paint!

3703
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:03,410
This is where it all started!

3704
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:09,430
Where it all started, the yellow paint.

3705
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:13,190
Oh, nice.

3706
02:32:13,930 --> 02:32:14,530
Yeah!

3707
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:19,990
Wait, engine rooms above us?

3708
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:21,390
I thought engine rooms in the basement.

3709
02:32:26,830 --> 02:32:28,030
This way.

3710
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:31,330
It's really like an area that we should...

3711
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:32,430
Oh, it's this way.

3712
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:33,870
Hello, guys!

3713
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:34,530
Are you guys gonna watch?

3714
02:32:35,890 --> 02:32:36,490
Okay.

3715
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:40,690
Yay, we got desert crocodile!

3716
02:32:41,250 --> 02:32:41,850
Whoa!

3717
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:43,250
What are you doing here?

3718
02:32:44,850 --> 02:32:45,450
Whoa!

3719
02:32:46,470 --> 02:32:48,090
You're not authorized to be here!

3720
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:50,950
Get out!

3721
02:32:51,550 --> 02:32:52,310
Get out!

3722
02:32:52,810 --> 02:32:54,050
Nobody likes you!

3723
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,890
That's right.

3724
02:32:57,730 --> 02:32:59,230
Nobody loves you.

3725
02:33:00,030 --> 02:33:01,610
You're just a pure...

3726
02:33:01,610 --> 02:33:05,190
You're just an imitation of the real thing.

3727
02:33:07,390 --> 02:33:07,870
Alright.

3728
02:33:08,050 --> 02:33:09,310
Nice getting rid of that.

3729
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:11,570
Do I need extra loot?

3730
02:33:12,410 --> 02:33:14,230
I'm always here for extra loot, guys.

3731
02:33:14,570 --> 02:33:14,750
I'm always here for extra loot, guys.

3732
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:16,910
Okay.

3733
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:17,490
Jump.

3734
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:17,810
No!

3735
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:18,530
My head!

3736
02:33:19,050 --> 02:33:19,930
I like that.

3737
02:33:19,970 --> 02:33:20,830
Yeah, what's his name?

3738
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:22,450
What's his name?

3739
02:33:25,130 --> 02:33:28,270
If you like that guy so much, what was he called?

3740
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:34,860
Ooh.

3741
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:37,300
This seems like a... Yeah, that seems like a tank fight.

3742
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:41,160
Alright.

3743
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:41,620
Alright.

3744
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:43,760
I like... I should just kill these guys with a tank.

3745
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:44,740
It's just much faster.

3746
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:48,380
It's just so much faster.

3747
02:33:48,540 --> 02:33:49,100
Oh, shit!

3748
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:49,480
Get away!

3749
02:33:50,980 --> 02:33:51,600
Is that it?

3750
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:52,740
That's all of them, right?

3751
02:33:53,820 --> 02:33:54,620
Just like that guy?

3752
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:55,120
You like that guy?

3753
02:33:55,240 --> 02:33:55,780
Name every guy.

3754
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:56,440
Exactly!

3755
02:33:58,480 --> 02:33:59,520
I'm glad you understand.

3756
02:34:04,510 --> 02:34:07,010
Okay, we gotta get rid of the small... these guys.

3757
02:34:07,650 --> 02:34:08,470
Wait, what?

3758
02:34:08,930 --> 02:34:10,310
What blocked it?

3759
02:34:13,090 --> 02:34:14,430
Okay, where's the other one?

3760
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:16,090
There he is.

3761
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:17,210
Oh, shi... Come on!

3762
02:34:17,570 --> 02:34:19,350
Why are my missiles so tiny?

3763
02:34:21,050 --> 02:34:21,810
There we go.

3764
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:23,470
Should be everything.

3765
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:24,970
Steve!

3766
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:27,730
That's my good friend Steve.

3767
02:34:30,030 --> 02:34:31,110
Steve Robotman.

3768
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:37,110
Alright.

3769
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:38,710
Alright.

3770
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:38,730
Alright.

3771
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:39,590
Alright.

3772
02:34:40,310 --> 02:34:41,990
We gotta get rid of this.

3773
02:34:42,750 --> 02:34:44,750
And then this.

3774
02:34:45,390 --> 02:34:46,370
And then this.

3775
02:34:47,090 --> 02:34:47,930
Alright.

3776
02:34:49,070 --> 02:34:49,490
Yay!

3777
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:54,110
Steve no...

3778
02:34:54,110 --> 02:34:55,190
Steve with the leg.

3779
02:34:55,970 --> 02:34:58,370
My good buddy Steve.

3780
02:34:58,450 --> 02:34:59,690
Steve Lego.

3781
02:35:01,410 --> 02:35:02,550
Oh, there's more loot.

3782
02:35:03,530 --> 02:35:05,670
Got another engine.

3783
02:35:06,090 --> 02:35:06,890
Oh my god.

3784
02:35:06,950 --> 02:35:07,530
So much loot.

3785
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:12,530
And...

3786
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:12,870
Whoa!

3787
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:17,210
So many robots for me.

3788
02:35:17,250 --> 02:35:18,670
Why are you hiding in the corner?

3789
02:35:20,050 --> 02:35:21,510
Bro, join the army!

3790
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:23,170
Join the fun!

3791
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:25,850
What are you afraid of?

3792
02:35:25,990 --> 02:35:26,650
Oh, shit.

3793
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:28,450
I'm just gonna...

3794
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:29,790
I'm gonna stand still.

3795
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:33,390
Just stand still and do all the work.

3796
02:35:34,690 --> 02:35:36,350
We don't have to dodge anything.

3797
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:38,190
Oh, wait.

3798
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:38,930
Is that...

3799
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:39,750
Okay.

3800
02:35:40,670 --> 02:35:42,630
There has to be loot on this other side.

3801
02:35:43,310 --> 02:35:43,810
Right?

3802
02:35:46,170 --> 02:35:47,550
I don't think so, guys.

3803
02:35:50,070 --> 02:35:50,570
No.

3804
02:35:50,730 --> 02:35:52,110
I don't want to waste my time.

3805
02:35:52,430 --> 02:35:55,530
I don't want to waste my time.

3806
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:56,730
Wait!

3807
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:57,110
Yellow!

3808
02:35:58,270 --> 02:35:59,390
The yellow light!

3809
02:35:59,970 --> 02:36:01,690
There has to be loot over here!

3810
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:06,030
Oh my god!

3811
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:07,150
I fucking knew it!

3812
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:08,410
Here we go!

3813
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:10,110
The yellow light!

3814
02:36:11,390 --> 02:36:12,670
Always follow the yellow!

3815
02:36:15,990 --> 02:36:17,110
Is there anything here?

3816
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:19,550
Oh my god!

3817
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:19,850
I knew it!

3818
02:36:19,950 --> 02:36:20,710
I knew it!

3819
02:36:21,090 --> 02:36:22,950
I knew there was always loot here.

3820
02:36:26,490 --> 02:36:27,090
Thank you.

3821
02:36:27,090 --> 02:36:27,970
Thank god for yellow!

3822
02:36:28,770 --> 02:36:29,370
Okay.

3823
02:36:30,250 --> 02:36:31,510
Faith in the yellow.

3824
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:34,170
Okay, and you go back.

3825
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:35,230
Boop!

3826
02:36:37,110 --> 02:36:37,710
Okay.

3827
02:36:37,810 --> 02:36:38,230
Nice.

3828
02:36:39,450 --> 02:36:40,970
Okay, and I'll just ride the bike.

3829
02:36:41,010 --> 02:36:41,630
Because it's faster.

3830
02:36:42,290 --> 02:36:42,890
No!

3831
02:36:44,810 --> 02:36:46,670
It's so hard to ride bikes inside.

3832
02:36:47,030 --> 02:36:48,270
Professor Oak was right.

3833
02:36:50,850 --> 02:36:51,450
No!

3834
02:36:51,650 --> 02:36:53,550
Professor Oak was right!

3835
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:56,970
You should never ride the bike inside!

3836
02:36:57,810 --> 02:36:59,530
You should never ride the bike inside!

3837
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:00,890
You should never ride the bike inside!

3838
02:37:00,890 --> 02:37:01,650
As if!

3839
02:37:01,910 --> 02:37:02,630
Come on!

3840
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:03,970
Let's check out that engine room!

3841
02:37:04,310 --> 02:37:05,290
Are we there yet?

3842
02:37:05,710 --> 02:37:07,490
Are we near the engine room now?

3843
02:37:07,630 --> 02:37:08,570
Oh, we have to be.

3844
02:37:08,610 --> 02:37:09,150
There's a...

3845
02:37:09,710 --> 02:37:10,610
There's a...

3846
02:37:10,610 --> 02:37:12,290
The water here.

3847
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:15,370
There you go.

3848
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:20,650
I should be able to drink in the tank so my tank automatically gets healed from water.

3849
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:21,490
I should be able to drink in the tank so my tank automatically gets healed from water.

3850
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:24,950
I'll swap in your equipment now.

3851
02:37:25,150 --> 02:37:25,950
Oh, the customization?

3852
02:37:27,430 --> 02:37:28,030
Alright.

3853
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:29,010
What is this?

3854
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:32,470
What the fuck?

3855
02:37:34,610 --> 02:37:35,610
Is it better?

3856
02:37:36,050 --> 02:37:37,050
I can't tell.

3857
02:37:37,270 --> 02:37:38,170
Keep upgraded.

3858
02:37:39,990 --> 02:37:41,190
Uh... Require...

3859
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:42,330
Let's see.

3860
02:37:42,430 --> 02:37:43,030
Weapon...

3861
02:37:43,030 --> 02:37:45,110
It can break?!

3862
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:46,890
Shots exploded.

3863
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:50,030
Your vehicle is too low leveled?!

3864
02:37:50,030 --> 02:37:51,190
Oh my god.

3865
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:51,690
What?

3866
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:55,430
You mean my vehicle is too low leveled?

3867
02:37:55,430 --> 02:37:56,450
What do you mean?

3868
02:37:59,570 --> 02:38:01,610
I can't believe it.

3869
02:38:01,710 --> 02:38:03,250
How dare they say that?

3870
02:38:03,510 --> 02:38:05,070
You're not low level!

3871
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:07,630
Okay.

3872
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:10,010
V8 engine.

3873
02:38:10,290 --> 02:38:11,590
Boost gauge use.

3874
02:38:12,570 --> 02:38:13,710
Plus 37.

3875
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:15,590
Boost recovery.

3876
02:38:15,830 --> 02:38:16,910
Boost accelerator.

3877
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:18,910
Built for speed.

3878
02:38:19,450 --> 02:38:21,050
Oh, I like speed though.

3879
02:38:21,870 --> 02:38:23,430
Maybe we should get speed.

3880
02:38:23,590 --> 02:38:23,850
Wait.

3881
02:38:24,670 --> 02:38:25,590
I don't know.

3882
02:38:25,810 --> 02:38:26,590
Do we get this?

3883
02:38:26,830 --> 02:38:28,330
V8 should be better.

3884
02:38:28,890 --> 02:38:29,390
Okay.

3885
02:38:29,890 --> 02:38:30,730
Reinforced fender.

3886
02:38:32,490 --> 02:38:33,970
At the cost of speed.

3887
02:38:34,070 --> 02:38:37,190
Well, I just had speed fixed but then I have better defense.

3888
02:38:37,350 --> 02:38:38,070
So I might as well.

3889
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:41,050
I'm at fires and incoming adds armor place for enhance.

3890
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:42,830
I feel like defense is better.

3891
02:38:44,430 --> 02:38:45,790
Yeah, I'm gonna get the defense.

3892
02:38:46,090 --> 02:38:47,170
Power plus chip.

3893
02:38:48,470 --> 02:38:48,970
Uh...

3894
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:52,770
Oh.

3895
02:38:52,930 --> 02:38:53,330
Wait.

3896
02:38:53,490 --> 02:38:53,650
No!

3897
02:38:55,090 --> 02:38:55,570
Dragoons!

3898
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:57,230
This is why I have better Dragoons!

3899
02:39:02,390 --> 02:39:03,290
Oh my god.

3900
02:39:03,310 --> 02:39:03,930
Better Dragoons.

3901
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:05,290
How could you betray me like that?

3902
02:39:05,450 --> 02:39:06,670
After I like...

3903
02:39:09,230 --> 02:39:11,350
After I fucking shut you out.

3904
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:12,270
After I fucking shut you out.

3905
02:39:12,270 --> 02:39:12,810
After I fucking shut you out.

3906
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:14,010
A scam.

3907
02:39:15,170 --> 02:39:16,030
Oh my god.

3908
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:17,730
All my vehicles are too low level.

3909
02:39:17,810 --> 02:39:18,410
You're all babies!

3910
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:19,190
You're all babies!

3911
02:39:34,310 --> 02:39:34,870
Wait.

3912
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:35,430
What is he holding?

3913
02:39:35,550 --> 02:39:36,690
Is that the power?

3914
02:39:40,430 --> 02:39:42,670
How can we compete with that?

3915
02:39:43,370 --> 02:39:44,930
Is that what he was after?

3916
02:39:45,230 --> 02:39:45,970
That's the...

3917
02:39:45,970 --> 02:39:47,330
That has to be like a power core.

3918
02:39:49,450 --> 02:39:50,430
Oh no.

3919
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:53,270
You've got to be kidding me.

3920
02:39:53,610 --> 02:39:54,330
What is it?

3921
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:56,870
What is it?

3922
02:39:56,990 --> 02:39:57,270
Yeah.

3923
02:40:01,850 --> 02:40:02,410
That's...

3924
02:40:03,250 --> 02:40:03,810
Okay.

3925
02:40:03,850 --> 02:40:04,370
Equanium.

3926
02:40:04,750 --> 02:40:05,510
Equanium?

3927
02:40:06,930 --> 02:40:07,690
Equa...

3928
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:09,710
Sorry.

3929
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:11,990
It just sounds like baby talk.

3930
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:13,930
Put it on the ground carefully.

3931
02:40:13,930 --> 02:40:14,350
Oh my god.

3932
02:40:14,390 --> 02:40:15,290
Is that a queen?

3933
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:20,650
I just bump could trigger a massive explosion.

3934
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:22,730
I just bump could trigger a massive explosion.

3935
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:24,070
Oh really?

3936
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:26,730
The uranium of this world.

3937
02:40:26,770 --> 02:40:27,270
It's just...

3938
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:28,470
Talk for uranium.

3939
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:31,790
You mean like this?

3940
02:40:33,530 --> 02:40:33,930
What?

3941
02:40:34,510 --> 02:40:35,090
What?

3942
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:37,170
We just said it'll fucking cause an explosion.

3943
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:38,970
No.

3944
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:39,910
Everyone.

3945
02:40:40,230 --> 02:40:40,750
Get down!

3946
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:41,530
What?

3947
02:40:47,850 --> 02:40:49,050
Oh my god.

3948
02:40:49,050 --> 02:40:49,570
It's a queen.

3949
02:40:51,490 --> 02:40:51,890
Wait.

3950
02:40:52,050 --> 02:40:52,730
Nothing happened.

3951
02:40:53,530 --> 02:40:55,310
That was anticlimactic.

3952
02:40:56,030 --> 02:40:58,600
Uh huh.

3953
02:40:58,780 --> 02:40:59,300
Yeah.

3954
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:00,720
Didn't explode?

3955
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:03,260
Don't you st...

3956
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:05,440
You fools.

3957
02:41:09,570 --> 02:41:10,870
Oh he's crazy.

3958
02:41:10,970 --> 02:41:11,770
He just threw that.

3959
02:41:12,650 --> 02:41:14,790
It's been out of the equanium furnace.

3960
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:16,110
I'm sorry.

3961
02:41:16,470 --> 02:41:19,090
It's been out of the equanium.

3962
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:22,630
Oh it only explodes at high temperatures.

3963
02:41:23,950 --> 02:41:26,090
You think that's funny?

3964
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:26,890
You jerk!

3965
02:41:28,650 --> 02:41:30,510
Hand over the equanium.

3966
02:41:30,730 --> 02:41:32,310
It's not something humanity can be trusted with.

3967
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:33,410
I can't hear it.

3968
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:35,450
Why didn't you guys...

3969
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:38,110
You guys.

3970
02:41:38,210 --> 02:41:38,770
I can't.

3971
02:41:38,870 --> 02:41:40,050
I can't hear it every time.

3972
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:40,530
Oh.

3973
02:41:40,570 --> 02:41:41,630
Of course.

3974
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:45,310
As is.

3975
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:47,150
Do you take me for a fool?

3976
02:41:51,160 --> 02:41:52,400
Don't worry old man.

3977
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:54,320
I'll get it back by force.

3978
02:41:57,940 --> 02:41:58,760
Oh shit.

3979
02:41:58,880 --> 02:41:59,080
Alright.

3980
02:41:59,360 --> 02:41:59,900
It's okay.

3981
02:41:59,980 --> 02:42:00,780
I have the missile.

3982
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:01,900
Go ahead and try.

3983
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:03,680
I'll humor you.

3984
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:04,660
Your fault.

3985
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:06,360
You did this.

3986
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:10,280
Absolutely cannot hand over the equanium.

3987
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:12,700
No!

3988
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:14,600
I ruined it!

3989
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:15,760
No!

3990
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:21,580
Every time he saves it now it's just in my mind.

3991
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:24,040
Guys I ruined it.

3992
02:42:25,700 --> 02:42:28,260
What the fuck happened to my t- Okay there he is.

3993
02:42:29,020 --> 02:42:30,980
Can I just shoot him from up here?

3994
02:42:32,560 --> 02:42:33,200
Yeah.

3995
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:37,500
Doki how could you do this?

3996
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:38,940
Oh shit!

3997
02:42:39,060 --> 02:42:40,580
What the fuck!

3998
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:42,140
Oh shit!

3999
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:43,180
Okay we're gonna...

4000
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:46,620
Let me get that... remember that missile thing?

4001
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:47,820
Let me fucking...

4002
02:42:47,820 --> 02:42:49,280
I can't swapp- Okay.

4003
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:51,520
Guys I didn't realize.

4004
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:53,980
Oh no.

4005
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:55,560
Oh no.

4006
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:56,240
Oh no.

4007
02:42:56,940 --> 02:42:59,020
We gotta get rid of the little guys though.

4008
02:42:59,540 --> 02:43:01,380
Oh we gotta get rid of the little guys.

4009
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:01,820
Oh.

4010
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:04,080
Oh that...

4011
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,520
If only I had that...

4012
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,620
He jumped over it?

4013
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:10,100
Okay that's not fair.

4014
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:12,880
He literally jumped over it.

4015
02:43:13,060 --> 02:43:13,680
He literally jumped over it.

4016
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:15,780
What the f- you can do that?

4017
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:17,220
He's an ass.

4018
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:18,680
But a dangerous one Prince.

4019
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:20,520
Wait wait wait what was the one?

4020
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:23,740
Guys what was the move?

4021
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:25,880
That lets you...

4022
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:27,140
Let me see you summon people.

4023
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:28,300
I forgot.

4024
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:31,180
Guys you guys remember?

4025
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:33,860
How do I summon people?

4026
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:35,560
Really capstache?

4027
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:36,800
I don't remember!

4028
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:40,920
Okay.

4029
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:42,120
Okay.

4030
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:42,960
Get rid of these guys.

4031
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:45,720
There was- you can summon people!

4032
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:48,620
How do I use the ally skills?

4033
02:43:48,780 --> 02:43:49,240
I don't remember!

4034
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:50,140
Oh god.

4035
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:52,160
Okay nice we got rid of him.

4036
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:55,480
On the controller!

4037
02:43:58,280 --> 02:43:59,860
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

4038
02:44:01,480 --> 02:44:02,520
Oh god.

4039
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:05,140
I don't remember how to summon allies!

4040
02:44:05,900 --> 02:44:06,420
LB!

4041
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:07,600
Oh LB.

4042
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:08,120
LB LB!

4043
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:09,260
RAL go in there!

4044
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:13,460
Shoot your guy- oh shit yes go Ral go!

4045
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:15,640
Oh my god Ral's actually helpful!

4046
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:17,880
Holy shit!

4047
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:19,900
Oh my god!

4048
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:21,860
No no no Ral I'm not letting you take this kill!

4049
02:44:29,060 --> 02:44:31,380
That robot's so much- Yeah but he's dead!

4050
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:32,980
That robot's dead!

4051
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:38,060
Someone help!

4052
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:41,100
Save me from this frightful fiend!

4053
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:43,580
Someone help!

4054
02:44:43,580 --> 02:44:44,360
I did it guys!

4055
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,680
What the fuck?

4056
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,060
Hey come to Spino!

4057
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:56,380
We're looking for new villi- like citizens!

4058
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:00,860
They're on a lunch break.

4059
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:06,400
We're always looking for new citizens at Spino!

4060
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:11,740
Whoa!

4061
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:13,500
Aq-WOW!

4062
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:15,980
Not the Aquamium!

4063
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:19,700
Not the Aquamium!

4064
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:21,420
Oh whoa not the Aquamium!

4065
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:23,320
Why is it that everyone we fight is so good at running away?

4066
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:25,740
Why is it that everyone we fight is so good at running away?

4067
02:45:25,740 --> 02:45:26,680
I'll inform Ari.

4068
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:28,980
We'll let the army pursue Epi.

4069
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:29,560
Stop!

4070
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:33,700
The Aquanium is our top priority now.

4071
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:34,060
The Aquanium is our top priority now.

4072
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:37,440
There might still be some left in the engine room.

4073
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,740
Let's go check.

4074
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:46,200
I think my favorite is hearing an old man call us the Aquamium.

4075
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:54,020
God damn it Doki you ruined it!

4076
02:45:57,500 --> 02:45:59,960
That word is ruined for him!

4077
02:46:05,380 --> 02:46:07,900
I like when Rouse says it too.

4078
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:11,040
I feel like it's even worse when Rouse says it though.

4079
02:46:11,180 --> 02:46:11,720
I feel like it's even worse when Rouse says it though.

4080
02:46:11,740 --> 02:46:12,540
I love how we got back from Epi.

4081
02:46:12,580 --> 02:46:13,700
Must've been the only one.

4082
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:16,740
Does every battleship have one?

4083
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:19,660
Garry thank you for the super chat.

4084
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:20,100
Thank you!

4085
02:46:20,240 --> 02:46:21,600
That's why they went for Zeyu's ship!

4086
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:23,520
What do you mean?

4087
02:46:25,700 --> 02:46:30,240
Zeyu's personal battleship isn't as big as the Lisav battleship, but it's still huge.

4088
02:46:31,260 --> 02:46:33,800
Antigrav stones alone wouldn't be enough to fly it.

4089
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:35,140
But Aquamium.

4090
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:37,520
That could probably do the trick.

4091
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:39,300
Ah that's why I didn't need it!

4092
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:47,460
No!

4093
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:53,080
No!

4094
02:46:57,860 --> 02:47:00,580
How much does it say this way?

4095
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:04,780
I can't hear it, Doki!

4096
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:06,700
Why did you do this to us?!

4097
02:47:10,660 --> 02:47:13,060
I heard you mention it on the radio, but...

4098
02:47:13,060 --> 02:47:14,720
I like how it's just rousing it too.

4099
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:20,240
It was a gigantic explosion which destroyed a vast area.

4100
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:27,080
And the cause, or rather the fuel used to generate it, was Aquanium.

4101
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:31,680
It's the simple things that make me laugh.

4102
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:36,860
The great Aquanium explosion!

4103
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:47,580
I'm sorry to pry, but it feels like there's more to this story.

4104
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:53,850
You don't trust me enough to tell me?

4105
02:47:55,210 --> 02:47:56,810
What's the real story, Rao?

4106
02:47:57,570 --> 02:47:58,830
Get out of my head!

4107
02:47:59,090 --> 02:48:00,050
Get out of my head!

4108
02:48:02,070 --> 02:48:06,430
There's something I haven't been able to bring myself to tell you either.

4109
02:48:07,250 --> 02:48:09,030
Dear god, what's this?

4110
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:10,630
Oh, no, this is your Aquarium!

4111
02:48:11,130 --> 02:48:11,610
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're talking about.

4112
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:13,590
Thank you for the super chat, dear god.

4113
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:14,710
Thank you, thank you.

4114
02:48:14,750 --> 02:48:16,630
My show's... oh, what's this?

4115
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:22,410
Did you drop the Aquarium and make a Blu-ray that killed 10,000 people?

4116
02:48:22,690 --> 02:48:22,990
Wow!

4117
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:25,290
Thank you for the super chat!

4118
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:26,970
Thank you, thank you!

4119
02:48:28,690 --> 02:48:29,550
I feel you.

4120
02:48:29,590 --> 02:48:30,390
Thank you for the super chat.

4121
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:31,210
Thank you, thank you.

4122
02:48:31,570 --> 02:48:33,890
Aquarium's gonna be stuck in my head for a week.

4123
02:48:34,770 --> 02:48:35,390
You're right.

4124
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:36,290
Let's get back.

4125
02:48:36,390 --> 02:48:37,730
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4126
02:48:41,610 --> 02:48:42,290
Alright, nice.

4127
02:48:42,470 --> 02:48:44,610
Is this... is the arc over?

4128
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:45,890
Are we done with...

4129
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:49,410
Are we done with the... the O-O-Fi's uranium?

4130
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:59,080
This is a serious situation, Doki, out there.

4131
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:00,940
Then don't name it Aquarium!

4132
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:03,420
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4133
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:08,220
They literally couldn't have named it anything else.

4134
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:10,020
That epi guy.

4135
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:13,080
He ran off down this side passage, didn't he?

4136
02:49:14,060 --> 02:49:15,980
Could very well be a shortcut.

4137
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:17,220
Let's find out.

4138
02:49:17,560 --> 02:49:18,040
Alright.

4139
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:19,080
It's a shortcut?

4140
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:20,160
I like shortcuts.

4141
02:49:23,420 --> 02:49:24,560
I love shortcuts.

4142
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:29,340
Okay, this is not as short as I thought it was.

4143
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:30,300
Thief.

4144
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:31,640
Liar.

4145
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:32,880
You said this was a shortcut.

4146
02:49:35,180 --> 02:49:37,160
A shortcut should be like fast travel.

4147
02:49:38,560 --> 02:49:40,180
The Great O-O-R.

4148
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:41,060
Ha ha ha ha!

4149
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:47,480
Oh, I passed Materials?

4150
02:49:47,800 --> 02:49:48,360
Oh, whatever.

4151
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:49,660
It's fine.

4152
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:54,780
That's fine.

4153
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:56,980
I mean, I could go back up and get it.

4154
02:49:58,700 --> 02:49:59,140
Alright.

4155
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:00,720
Let's go back up.

4156
02:50:01,800 --> 02:50:03,460
I mean, I could... I'll just bring out my bike.

4157
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:06,400
What if I can just like walk off?

4158
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:07,280
No, I can't.

4159
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:08,540
Oh, I can't walk off.

4160
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:11,160
Even though it feels like there's stuff here.

4161
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:14,740
This is the longest... I missed Materials?

4162
02:50:14,820 --> 02:50:15,180
Where?

4163
02:50:16,460 --> 02:50:17,700
Did I get gaslighted?

4164
02:50:21,690 --> 02:50:22,410
I got gaslighted?

4165
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:26,610
Where the fuck are these Materials that gaslight?

4166
02:50:26,610 --> 02:50:27,310
Oh, there it is.

4167
02:50:27,690 --> 02:50:28,590
No, I didn't.

4168
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:29,550
Oh my god.

4169
02:50:29,570 --> 02:50:31,210
My Dragoon's not lying to me?

4170
02:50:31,330 --> 02:50:31,990
What is this?

4171
02:50:32,830 --> 02:50:34,210
Ha ha ha ha!

4172
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:36,950
Holy shit, guys.

4173
02:50:37,070 --> 02:50:37,710
He didn't lie.

4174
02:50:39,370 --> 02:50:40,810
He didn't lie at all.

4175
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:46,680
What a legend.

4176
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:48,160
Okay.

4177
02:50:48,260 --> 02:50:48,640
Okay.

4178
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:49,940
Nice.

4179
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:51,580
What the heck?

4180
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:52,120
Okay.

4181
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:54,480
I need to... Get me out of that bike!

4182
02:50:54,780 --> 02:50:56,560
Get me off this bike so I can get down!

4183
02:50:57,420 --> 02:50:58,220
Not so Deadpool!

4184
02:50:58,360 --> 02:50:59,100
Thank you for the super chat!

4185
02:50:59,180 --> 02:50:59,860
Thank you, thank you!

4186
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:03,020
Remember Doki, even in Apex you'll be shooting at a cranium.

4187
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:04,140
Thank you for the super chat!

4188
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:05,020
Thank you, thank you!

4189
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:07,120
My my, thank you for the super chat!

4190
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:08,060
Thank you, thank you!

4191
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:10,800
One out of ten, don't lie to Thor!

4192
02:51:11,400 --> 02:51:12,080
Ha ha ha ha!

4193
02:51:13,240 --> 02:51:13,920
It's true.

4194
02:51:14,460 --> 02:51:15,420
Ha ha ha ha!

4195
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:19,480
Alright.

4196
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:20,380
Nice.

4197
02:51:21,400 --> 02:51:22,800
And then we leave.

4198
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:31,370
Wait, a new general.

4199
02:51:31,650 --> 02:51:32,490
Who's this guy?

4200
02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:39,520
Elvis?

4201
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:42,500
Pompous Man?

4202
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:46,320
Elvis in my anime game?

4203
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:57,000
The King.

4204
02:51:57,580 --> 02:51:58,100
Ha ha ha!

4205
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:00,840
Why do I have two exclamation points?

4206
02:52:02,180 --> 02:52:04,220
Are they like quests here?

4207
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,880
Oh, they just have new stuff.

4208
02:52:08,220 --> 02:52:09,560
A car blueprint?

4209
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:11,740
I don't need another car.

4210
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:15,200
Alright, let's head home.

4211
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:18,180
Back to Spino we go.

4212
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:20,540
The King, he's back!

4213
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:35,820
We ran into that armed group at the Lee Saab battleship.

4214
02:52:36,320 --> 02:52:36,800
What?

4215
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:39,820
So that smoke must have been their doing.

4216
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:41,220
It's fine though.

4217
02:52:41,320 --> 02:52:42,440
We thumped them good.

4218
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:43,860
Yeah, we th- beat them.

4219
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:46,060
My apologies that you had to deal with them.

4220
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:50,420
We had our hands full subduing the detachment of enemies who went north.

4221
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:51,940
Wait, who were the people who went north then?

4222
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:52,940
The Royal Army and Chaos.

4223
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:55,260
We barely managed to fend them off.

4224
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:58,000
They'll likely rejoin and cause more unrest.

4225
02:52:58,400 --> 02:52:59,300
They're with Zeu.

4226
02:52:59,300 --> 02:53:01,160
But who are they?

4227
02:53:01,660 --> 02:53:02,780
No idea.

4228
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:05,680
All we know is that they're both well organized.

4229
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:07,160
And well armed.

4230
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:09,820
They're the Forestland Army.

4231
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:11,180
The Forestland?

4232
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:12,660
It's Greenland!

4233
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:14,980
But... that's impossible.

4234
02:53:15,620 --> 02:53:18,660
We signed an armistice with Forestland decades ago.

4235
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:19,120
We signed an armistice with Forestland decades ago.

4236
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:22,460
I like we have Sandland and then Forestland.

4237
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:23,180
I like we have Sandland and then Forestland.

4238
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:23,560
Like I...

4239
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:29,120
But like the thing is, this land isn't even called Sandland officially.

4240
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:29,280
But like the thing is, this land isn't even called Sandland officially.

4241
02:53:29,300 --> 02:53:30,420
I'm pretty sure.

4242
02:53:30,560 --> 02:53:35,400
Where we're at, it's not even officially called Sandland.

4243
02:53:36,220 --> 02:53:38,660
But yet, we have Forestland.

4244
02:53:39,480 --> 02:53:39,960
So...

4245
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:42,440
But...

4246
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,760
Is it actually officially called Sandland?

4247
02:53:47,020 --> 02:53:47,680
But like...

4248
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:49,040
Sandland was like...

4249
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:53,960
artificially made because of one dickhead that decided to build a dam.

4250
02:53:54,580 --> 02:53:55,300
Like...

4251
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:57,800
That's the thing.

4252
02:53:58,300 --> 02:53:59,280
Forest... like...

4253
02:53:59,300 --> 02:54:01,480
Sandland was artificially made.

4254
02:54:01,700 --> 02:54:03,220
And it was so fucked up too.

4255
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:04,280
If you think about it.

4256
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:09,380
I also find it hard to believe.

4257
02:54:09,660 --> 02:54:09,960
But...

4258
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:12,660
They call their commander General.

4259
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:16,220
That only adds up if they're part of a large official military.

4260
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:18,700
That only adds up if they're part of a large official military.

4261
02:54:18,700 --> 02:54:19,300
Yes, but...

4262
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:23,860
What makes you so certain that it's the Forestland Army?

4263
02:54:24,660 --> 02:54:25,140
Well...

4264
02:54:25,140 --> 02:54:26,680
Is there going to be Waterland?

4265
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:29,280
Don't feel you have to share it here if it isn't a waterland.

4266
02:54:29,300 --> 02:54:29,920
It involves your family.

4267
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:31,960
Sandland is AI generated.

4268
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:35,580
I think he should know too though.

4269
02:54:35,640 --> 02:54:36,280
No, Greenland...

4270
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:38,360
We all know Greenland is a real country.

4271
02:54:38,820 --> 02:54:40,800
Forestland is basically bootleg Greenland.

4272
02:54:41,080 --> 02:54:41,680
But like...

4273
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:44,320
Greenland is actually like Iceland.

4274
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:46,040
And Iceland is Greenland.

4275
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:48,960
Because Greenland is actually incredibly cold.

4276
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:53,200
But Iceland is the actual non- Iceland is the actual not cold area.

4277
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:54,420
General Ahri.

4278
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:56,080
Would you mind coming alone?

4279
02:54:57,640 --> 02:54:58,240
Understood.

4280
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:01,240
Please, lead the way.

4281
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:02,620
Alright.

4282
02:55:03,100 --> 02:55:03,880
Follow me.

4283
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:06,320
So you get click baited.

4284
02:55:06,840 --> 02:55:08,800
Greenland and Iceland click baits you.

4285
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:13,180
Alright, we got it.

4286
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:13,860
Oh, the cat!

4287
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:17,540
Njaginbu wants to talk to us.

4288
02:55:22,070 --> 02:55:22,590
Alright.

4289
02:55:23,810 --> 02:55:24,330
Hey!

4290
02:55:24,330 --> 02:55:25,870
Nice to see you again!

4291
02:55:26,410 --> 02:55:27,870
Is it just my imagination?

4292
02:55:28,250 --> 02:55:29,990
Or has the town gotten more lively?

4293
02:55:30,290 --> 02:55:31,070
Yeah, I did that!

4294
02:55:31,530 --> 02:55:32,930
I found something cool!

4295
02:55:33,050 --> 02:55:34,470
Oh, thank you!

4296
02:55:36,930 --> 02:55:38,290
Yeah, I can't afford anything.

4297
02:55:38,490 --> 02:55:39,870
Because I have not been exploring.

4298
02:55:40,050 --> 02:55:40,690
That's okay.

4299
02:55:41,550 --> 02:55:42,930
Wait, why are you so short?

4300
02:55:44,130 --> 02:55:45,070
Oh my god!

4301
02:55:45,830 --> 02:55:46,350
Sorry!

4302
02:55:46,830 --> 02:55:50,130
Dookie, you're not supposed to just ask somebody why they're so short!

4303
02:55:50,610 --> 02:55:51,130
Sorry.

4304
02:55:51,570 --> 02:55:53,290
I just wasn't expecting that.

4305
02:55:55,130 --> 02:55:56,010
He's wide!

4306
02:55:57,430 --> 02:55:58,290
Let's hear it.

4307
02:55:59,690 --> 02:56:02,710
The reason I can be so sure they're from Forestland...

4308
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:03,830
Are you from Forestland?

4309
02:56:04,130 --> 02:56:06,910
Is because I'm also originally from Forestland.

4310
02:56:06,910 --> 02:56:08,630
You are a Forestland person?

4311
02:56:09,850 --> 02:56:11,170
What did you say?

4312
02:56:11,450 --> 02:56:11,910
You are...

4313
02:56:12,650 --> 02:56:14,410
You're an illegal immigrant?

4314
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:20,890
Oh my god!

4315
02:56:20,890 --> 02:56:21,230
Oh my god!

4316
02:56:22,410 --> 02:56:23,710
Oh my god!

4317
02:56:23,850 --> 02:56:27,550
Oh my god!

4318
02:56:28,630 --> 02:56:30,730
She's an illegal immigrant!

4319
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:32,570
Guys, I can say it because it's...

4320
02:56:33,490 --> 02:56:34,610
Holy shit!

4321
02:56:35,770 --> 02:56:37,470
Oh my god!

4322
02:56:38,290 --> 02:56:39,750
She's an illegal immigrant!

4323
02:56:41,010 --> 02:56:41,910
You can't!

4324
02:56:41,970 --> 02:56:44,110
Basically, it means she's not allowed in this country.

4325
02:56:46,370 --> 02:56:46,930
Deporter!

4326
02:56:47,490 --> 02:56:47,590
Deporter!

4327
02:56:49,990 --> 02:56:50,550
Wow!

4328
02:56:51,510 --> 02:56:52,230
That's bad!

4329
02:56:58,330 --> 02:57:00,690
Why did you decide to come here on your own?

4330
02:57:02,190 --> 02:57:03,410
We translated it!

4331
02:57:03,950 --> 02:57:04,510
We translated it!

4332
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:07,310
We have aliens in the workshop!

4333
02:57:07,970 --> 02:57:08,110
We have aliens in the workshop!

4334
02:57:08,650 --> 02:57:10,750
But I was the only one who made it.

4335
02:57:11,830 --> 02:57:13,230
Oh my god!

4336
02:57:13,290 --> 02:57:14,950
There are several illegal immigrants!

4337
02:57:16,830 --> 02:57:18,070
There are several illegal immigrants!

4338
02:57:18,190 --> 02:57:21,590
What compels you to take the risk of coming to Sandland?

4339
02:57:23,750 --> 02:57:28,330
I wanted to find people willing I wanted to find people willing to help us overthrow the Forestland government.

4340
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:29,770
Oh my god.

4341
02:57:29,790 --> 02:57:30,670
She doesn't have a video.

4342
02:57:30,670 --> 02:57:31,150
Lisa, guys.

4343
02:57:35,790 --> 02:57:40,250
She's taking hard working Sattelander's jobs.

4344
02:57:40,870 --> 02:57:42,410
That's so dead-full.

4345
02:57:42,490 --> 02:57:43,810
Thank you for the super chat.

4346
02:57:43,930 --> 02:57:44,270
Thank you.

4347
02:57:45,470 --> 02:57:46,230
Oh no!

4348
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:54,150
She actually took our jobs!

4349
02:57:55,390 --> 02:57:57,250
Sattelander's the land of opportunity!

4350
02:58:00,670 --> 02:58:03,030
An imprisoned kind King Jam out of nowhere!

4351
02:58:03,350 --> 02:58:05,670
Is he wearing a helmet with a horn on top?

4352
02:58:06,170 --> 02:58:07,590
The forest land army!

4353
02:58:07,690 --> 02:58:08,930
Oh no, that's the supreme general.

4354
02:58:10,970 --> 02:58:13,070
Magic, thank you for the super chat.

4355
02:58:13,210 --> 02:58:14,950
Bro, what the fuck?

4356
02:58:15,170 --> 02:58:20,190
The helmet is like not doing it justice.

4357
02:58:21,010 --> 02:58:24,690
We've crossed blades with that general Epi you fought on the Lisa battleship before.

4358
02:58:27,630 --> 02:58:28,810
What do you think?

4359
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:30,170
General RA.

4360
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:31,230
Breadth the leader.

4361
02:58:31,850 --> 02:58:35,130
I'll admit, it does line up with our intel on forest land.

4362
02:58:35,470 --> 02:58:36,310
It's perfect for us.

4363
02:58:36,310 --> 02:58:38,330
Don't worry, you get the pass, green card.

4364
02:58:41,030 --> 02:58:42,290
I think so too.

4365
02:58:42,450 --> 02:58:44,830
The timing of all this makes total sense.

4366
02:58:45,170 --> 02:58:46,550
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

4367
02:58:46,610 --> 02:58:47,390
Thank you, thank you.

4368
02:58:47,430 --> 02:58:48,310
The sand land dream.

4369
02:58:48,330 --> 02:58:52,410
The way the chaos downfall would be the perfect time for a rival nation to move against us.

4370
02:58:54,290 --> 02:58:58,570
But surely, they must realize the severe consequences of such aggression.

4371
02:59:00,170 --> 02:59:04,270
What could possibly motivate them to take the risk of invading us?

4372
02:59:05,870 --> 02:59:06,510
Aquanium.

4373
02:59:08,610 --> 02:59:09,630
Thanks, Fou.

4374
02:59:10,310 --> 02:59:10,950
What?

4375
02:59:11,110 --> 02:59:11,670
Impossible.

4376
02:59:12,150 --> 02:59:15,470
Our entire supply was lost in that explosion thirty years ago.

4377
02:59:17,130 --> 02:59:25,930
That's not so the Lissa battleship was powered by Aquaenium and I'd bet good money that say use mobile fortress was as well.

4378
02:59:27,210 --> 02:59:27,850
Stop!

4379
02:59:27,850 --> 02:59:28,430
NO, STOP.

4380
02:59:28,430 --> 02:59:30,150
We can't take out the battle ship's aquanium.

4381
02:59:48,410 --> 02:59:50,130
Dark God, thank you for the super chat.

4382
02:59:50,290 --> 02:59:50,950
Thank you, thank you.

4383
02:59:51,770 --> 02:59:53,730
We have demons and we have aliens.

4384
02:59:53,830 --> 02:59:56,410
Not exactly the aliens you would expect though.

4385
02:59:57,510 --> 03:00:00,070
Yeah, what about the Aquanium?

4386
03:00:08,330 --> 03:00:11,070
Someone else please say it.

4387
03:00:11,130 --> 03:00:13,110
Stop making Rao say it.

4388
03:00:22,450 --> 03:00:24,390
I don't know.

4389
03:00:24,490 --> 03:00:25,850
You're an illegal immigrant.

4390
03:00:26,410 --> 03:00:26,610
Oh no.

4391
03:00:28,930 --> 03:00:33,150
I can't believe this is this game.

4392
03:00:33,650 --> 03:00:35,070
What the fuck?

4393
03:00:36,950 --> 03:00:37,770
Bro.

4394
03:00:40,910 --> 03:00:44,710
Bro, I can't believe they called her an illegal immigrant.

4395
03:00:45,290 --> 03:00:46,590
What the fuck?

4396
03:00:49,310 --> 03:00:52,150
That's like the most out of pocket shit.

4397
03:00:52,530 --> 03:00:54,650
Oh my real life.

4398
03:00:56,410 --> 03:00:57,830
Oh my God.

4399
03:00:58,610 --> 03:01:01,870
That's a real written line in this game.

4400
03:01:06,470 --> 03:01:08,070
Oh my God.

4401
03:01:08,070 --> 03:01:08,310
You know what?

4402
03:01:08,370 --> 03:01:09,770
I'm glad I did a part three.

4403
03:01:09,790 --> 03:01:11,290
It was so worth it.

4404
03:01:11,470 --> 03:01:21,070
It seems to refer to those fighting against Commander Bread and his army who stole control over forest land from its king in a military coup.

4405
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:22,110
Oh.

4406
03:01:22,450 --> 03:01:26,390
So basically all it is is a bunch of people who really hate them?

4407
03:01:26,390 --> 03:01:26,970
Yeah.

4408
03:01:27,270 --> 03:01:30,730
Well, it's a military... Wait, but it's like a military coup.

4409
03:01:31,010 --> 03:01:32,070
That's like the worst one.

4410
03:01:32,470 --> 03:01:33,010
Isn't it?

4411
03:01:35,150 --> 03:01:37,390
Like that's the one you don't want to happen.

4412
03:01:39,270 --> 03:01:40,750
Gamble, thank you for the super chat.

4413
03:01:40,850 --> 03:01:41,270
Thank you.

4414
03:01:41,310 --> 03:01:42,010
Thank you.

4415
03:01:42,230 --> 03:01:43,670
Hello, Razadoki.

4416
03:01:43,770 --> 03:01:44,530
Thank you for the super chat.

4417
03:01:44,690 --> 03:01:44,910
Thank you.

4418
03:01:44,930 --> 03:01:45,430
Thank you.

4419
03:01:47,610 --> 03:01:48,770
Dude, that's real bad.

4420
03:01:52,010 --> 03:01:54,550
I've been thinking rather than just talking.

4421
03:01:54,550 --> 03:01:55,710
I'm glad we went with the English.

4422
03:01:57,950 --> 03:01:58,910
The English.

4423
03:01:58,970 --> 03:02:00,190
It's something I should show you.

4424
03:02:00,750 --> 03:02:01,810
Will you come with me?

4425
03:02:02,530 --> 03:02:03,010
Sure.

4426
03:02:03,250 --> 03:02:03,990
But where?

4427
03:02:05,430 --> 03:02:07,950
The site of the great Aquanium explosion.

4428
03:02:08,630 --> 03:02:09,110
Oh.

4429
03:02:09,890 --> 03:02:10,670
All right.

4430
03:02:10,950 --> 03:02:11,590
I'll come.

4431
03:02:13,810 --> 03:02:15,870
I like how serious he just got.

4432
03:02:15,870 --> 03:02:17,810
He's like, oh shit, the Aquanium?

4433
03:02:18,230 --> 03:02:18,970
All right, I'll come.

4434
03:02:21,210 --> 03:02:22,910
Stop saying it, Raph.

4435
03:02:25,190 --> 03:02:26,310
I got to follow.

4436
03:02:27,410 --> 03:02:28,370
You know what?

4437
03:02:29,310 --> 03:02:30,750
I'm going to call it here, guys.

4438
03:02:30,930 --> 03:02:34,650
I think this is the perfect time to call it today.

4439
03:02:40,610 --> 03:02:43,070
Everything... all the stuff we went through.

4440
03:02:43,190 --> 03:02:49,430
I think this is the perfect time to call this part of the stream.

4441
03:02:51,470 --> 03:02:52,030
Rallbacks.

4442
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:53,010
Don't worry, part four.

4443
03:02:53,010 --> 03:02:55,510
We'll do Rall's backstory in part four.

4444
03:02:55,970 --> 03:02:57,370
Guys, I had a great time.

4445
03:02:57,550 --> 03:02:58,730
I've been enjoying...

4446
03:02:59,670 --> 03:03:02,070
I've been enjoying this game a lot so far.

4447
03:03:02,230 --> 03:03:03,870
Let me swap real quick.

4448
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:04,450
Yeah.

4449
03:03:05,410 --> 03:03:07,430
Honestly, this game has been incredibly enjoyable.

4450
03:03:07,910 --> 03:03:09,590
I've been like... I really like the story.

4451
03:03:09,810 --> 03:03:12,450
I think like the only issue I had was that dungeon.

4452
03:03:12,730 --> 03:03:13,750
The last dungeon.

4453
03:03:13,890 --> 03:03:17,470
Only because like if it was a new area, I would be fine.

4454
03:03:17,710 --> 03:03:19,990
But the fact that like we had to redo...

4455
03:03:19,990 --> 03:03:21,190
Like not redo the dungeon.

4456
03:03:21,410 --> 03:03:22,290
But like...

4457
03:03:22,290 --> 03:03:23,370
You know like...

4458
03:03:24,150 --> 03:03:25,570
It's like a different...

4459
03:03:25,570 --> 03:03:27,470
A bit different but it was still the same.

4460
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:31,250
So like that was my only issue with the...

4461
03:03:31,250 --> 03:03:32,930
With the dungeon.

4462
03:03:33,270 --> 03:03:35,430
If it was a new dungeon, I would have been fine.

4463
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:38,690
But I didn't like that I had to like redo it.

4464
03:03:38,850 --> 03:03:39,090
Yeah.

4465
03:03:40,410 --> 03:03:40,890
But...

4466
03:03:40,890 --> 03:03:42,710
I've been having a really...

4467
03:03:43,290 --> 03:03:47,290
I wish they didn't have to reuse it for the new plot area.

4468
03:03:48,830 --> 03:03:49,310
Anyway.

4469
03:03:50,010 --> 03:03:52,170
Let's read some super chats everybody.

4470
03:03:52,290 --> 03:03:52,730
Okay.

4471
03:03:52,950 --> 03:03:54,190
We're gonna change the...

4472
03:03:54,830 --> 03:03:55,230
Uh...

4473
03:03:56,370 --> 03:03:57,510
We didn't get...

4474
03:03:57,510 --> 03:03:59,510
We didn't get to Greenland.

4475
03:04:01,630 --> 03:04:02,230
Wait, wait.

4476
03:04:02,590 --> 03:04:03,130
Wait, wait.

4477
03:04:03,130 --> 03:04:03,550
Okay, wait, wait.

4478
03:04:03,630 --> 03:04:04,070
New title.

4479
03:04:04,870 --> 03:04:05,670
Off to...

4480
03:04:07,650 --> 03:04:09,150
We got chairs...

4481
03:04:09,150 --> 03:04:09,270
Wait.

4482
03:04:09,350 --> 03:04:10,010
Off to...

4483
03:04:10,010 --> 03:04:10,310
No, no, no.

4484
03:04:10,310 --> 03:04:11,390
We didn't get to Greenland.

4485
03:04:11,490 --> 03:04:11,590
Yeah.

4486
03:04:11,610 --> 03:04:12,290
We should just do that.

4487
03:04:12,350 --> 03:04:12,790
I don't want...

4488
03:04:12,790 --> 03:04:16,710
I want the VOD watchers to feel the growth of the chairs.

4489
03:04:21,350 --> 03:04:22,270
We didn't get to Greenland.

4490
03:04:22,270 --> 03:04:22,930
We didn't get to Greenland.

4491
03:04:25,090 --> 03:04:25,470
Um...

4492
03:04:26,790 --> 03:04:28,030
NS, thank you for the super chat.

4493
03:04:28,090 --> 03:04:28,330
Thank you.

4494
03:04:28,370 --> 03:04:28,670
Thank you.

4495
03:04:28,670 --> 03:04:30,450
This turn of events is hurting my aquarium.

4496
03:04:30,750 --> 03:04:31,790
Thank you for the super chat.

4497
03:04:31,850 --> 03:04:32,090
Thank you.

4498
03:04:32,110 --> 03:04:32,630
Thank you.

4499
03:04:32,890 --> 03:04:34,430
Magic, thank you for the super chat.

4500
03:04:34,510 --> 03:04:34,750
Thank you.

4501
03:04:34,790 --> 03:04:35,210
Thank you.

4502
03:04:35,230 --> 03:04:37,150
Don't tell Aisah I was here.

4503
03:04:37,430 --> 03:04:38,550
Thank you for the super chat.

4504
03:04:38,630 --> 03:04:38,850
Thank you.

4505
03:04:38,910 --> 03:04:39,010
Thank you.

4506
03:04:39,030 --> 03:04:39,410
Okay.

4507
03:04:39,530 --> 03:04:46,450
Like the worst part, I think when they were like, oh my God, she's an illegal immigrant, was when the...

4508
03:04:46,450 --> 03:04:47,530
Oh, no spoilers?

4509
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:48,150
Okay.

4510
03:04:48,310 --> 03:04:48,550
Okay.

4511
03:04:48,590 --> 03:04:48,910
Okay.

4512
03:04:48,930 --> 03:04:49,190
Off.

4513
03:04:49,330 --> 03:04:49,970
We'll just write...

4514
03:04:50,370 --> 03:04:51,430
Off to Greenland.

4515
03:04:51,470 --> 03:04:51,690
Off to Greenland.

4516
03:04:51,810 --> 03:04:52,190
Off to Greenland.

4517
03:04:52,190 --> 03:04:52,250
Off to Greenland.

4518
03:04:52,250 --> 03:04:52,570
Okay.

4519
03:04:52,650 --> 03:04:53,610
We'll just put...

4520
03:04:53,610 --> 03:04:54,790
We don't want to spoil it.

4521
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:55,190
We don't...

4522
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:58,630
Was when the general was like super surprised.

4523
03:04:58,790 --> 03:05:04,290
That was like the reaction to it was the most fucked up part.

4524
03:05:07,930 --> 03:05:10,950
The fact that it's like, you're a criminal.

4525
03:05:15,210 --> 03:05:17,170
It's actually fucking crazy.

4526
03:05:17,590 --> 03:05:21,450
I was just like shocked.

4527
03:05:21,730 --> 03:05:22,210
It like...

4528
03:05:22,210 --> 03:05:22,230
I was like...

4529
03:05:22,230 --> 03:05:29,390
Actually, I was so shocked because like, I didn't expect that to be written out and also dumb.

4530
03:05:33,350 --> 03:05:37,930
And the fact that it was like, there were several of us, but only I made it.

4531
03:05:37,950 --> 03:05:39,610
I'm like, oh my God.

4532
03:05:40,050 --> 03:05:41,370
What the fuck?

4533
03:05:41,530 --> 03:05:43,370
It just came out of nowhere.

4534
03:05:43,990 --> 03:05:46,590
It actually was just...

4535
03:05:46,590 --> 03:05:47,890
It just happened.

4536
03:05:50,930 --> 03:05:52,210
I'm like, oh my God.

4537
03:05:52,210 --> 03:05:53,450
Not so Deadpool.

4538
03:05:53,590 --> 03:05:53,690
Not so Deadpool.

4539
03:05:53,690 --> 03:05:54,430
Thank you for the super chat.

4540
03:05:54,490 --> 03:05:54,750
Thank you.

4541
03:05:54,770 --> 03:05:55,290
Thank you.

4542
03:05:55,330 --> 03:05:57,410
Next stream time, two-week sad land.

4543
03:05:57,670 --> 03:05:57,890
No!

4544
03:05:59,170 --> 03:05:59,970
No, Deadpool.

4545
03:06:00,250 --> 03:06:01,170
Thank you for the super chat.

4546
03:06:01,270 --> 03:06:01,610
Thank you.

4547
03:06:01,630 --> 03:06:01,850
Thank you.

4548
03:06:01,850 --> 03:06:02,710
It got really real.

4549
03:06:03,330 --> 03:06:04,290
Like it really.

4550
03:06:06,790 --> 03:06:08,510
I got real there.

4551
03:06:08,750 --> 03:06:12,750
Yeah, we overthrew a government and then suddenly illegal immigrants.

4552
03:06:13,310 --> 03:06:15,230
I'm like, what?!

4553
03:06:18,130 --> 03:06:19,830
Guess, it's been a real comfy.

4554
03:06:19,870 --> 03:06:21,110
I loving the sad land playthrough.

4555
03:06:21,310 --> 03:06:22,010
Thank you for super chat.

4556
03:06:22,050 --> 03:06:22,190
Thank you for super chat.

4557
03:06:22,210 --> 03:06:22,550
Thank you, thank you.

4558
03:06:22,610 --> 03:06:27,770
Yeah, I've been really... I've definitely been really enjoying this.

4559
03:06:29,410 --> 03:06:35,310
I feel like, you know, especially when a lot of us are going in blind, like we don't know what's gonna happen and everything.

4560
03:06:35,710 --> 03:06:39,270
And then like, we've been surprised.

4561
03:06:40,190 --> 03:06:45,050
There's so many moments where we're just very surprised.

4562
03:06:48,590 --> 03:07:03,070
So, I've been having a... I've been having a great time just like enjoying the... I guess like reacting to it blind.

4563
03:07:03,290 --> 03:07:06,090
Because it's honestly been a fucking adventure.

4564
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:10,650
It's been such a fucking adventure.

4565
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:14,790
Alright, let's get some... which one?

4566
03:07:15,450 --> 03:07:16,750
Which one have we not read?

4567
03:07:19,230 --> 03:07:21,690
Oh my gosh, I read a lot that's coming in.

4568
03:07:21,810 --> 03:07:23,710
So, I don't know which one I haven't read yet.

4569
03:07:23,990 --> 03:07:24,990
I've been thinking about Super Chat.

4570
03:07:25,070 --> 03:07:25,650
Thank you, thank you.

4571
03:07:25,710 --> 03:07:29,190
You create an army of people willing to go to war with each other over ice cream flavors.

4572
03:07:29,370 --> 03:07:30,890
Doki, you made us this way.

4573

03:07:32,110 --> 03:07:32,950
Thank you, thank you.

4575
03:07:33,290 --> 03:07:34,750
Random, thank you for the Super Chat.

4576
03:07:34,790 --> 03:07:35,450
Thank you, thank you.

4577
03:07:35,730 --> 03:07:36,910
Doki, a whaling fund.

4578
03:07:36,990 --> 03:07:37,410
Let's go!

4579
03:07:38,050 --> 03:07:39,490
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4580
03:07:39,570 --> 03:07:40,390
Thank you, thank you.

4581
03:07:40,850 --> 03:07:42,930
Not so Deadpool, thank you for the Super Chat.

4582
03:07:42,970 --> 03:07:43,790
Thank you, thank you.

4583
03:07:44,430 --> 03:07:44,790
Um...

4584
03:07:46,450 --> 03:07:46,890
Link...

4585
03:07:46,890 --> 03:07:48,410
Yeah, I read a lot while coming in.

4586
03:07:48,490 --> 03:07:50,270
So, I like don't know which one I haven't...

4587
03:07:50,270 --> 03:07:52,430
I'm trying to remember which one I haven't read yet.

4588
03:07:53,750 --> 03:07:54,190
Uh...

4589
03:07:54,190 --> 03:07:55,870
Sharko, thank you for the Super Chat.

4590
03:07:55,930 --> 03:07:56,630
Thank you.

4591
03:07:56,750 --> 03:08:03,170
A bit of people here who don't even know about the Burger King rap commercial about SpongeBob Square Ass.

4592
03:08:03,450 --> 03:08:04,370
Wait, is that real?

4593
03:08:04,830 --> 03:08:06,070
Wait, I'm one of them.

4594
03:08:07,170 --> 03:08:07,750
What the fuck?

4595
03:08:07,770 --> 03:08:09,010
How old are you, Sharko?

4596
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:10,630
I'm joking.

4597
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:11,610
I'm joking.

4598
03:08:11,650 --> 03:08:13,710
Wait, this is 15 years ago.

4599
03:08:13,710 --> 03:08:15,270
What the heck?

4600
03:08:16,850 --> 03:08:17,970
What is this?

4601
03:08:20,590 --> 03:08:23,730
This is the thing that Sharko wanted us to watch.

4602
03:08:24,710 --> 03:08:25,630
What is this?

4603
03:08:27,670 --> 03:08:28,870
What the fuck?

4604
03:08:34,950 --> 03:08:36,450
Wait, Sharko, don't tell us your age.

4605
03:08:36,490 --> 03:08:37,450
We don't want you to talk straight age.

4606
03:08:37,750 --> 03:08:38,910
What the fuck?

4607
03:08:39,810 --> 03:08:41,030
Like, what is this?

4608
03:08:44,130 --> 03:08:45,390
Oh my god!

4609
03:09:05,620 --> 03:09:06,680
When is that?

4610
03:09:06,740 --> 03:09:07,860
When is 15 years ago?

4611
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:09,580
There's a million views on this?

4612
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:10,920
2009!

4613
03:09:11,880 --> 03:09:13,780
I'm surprised I actually didn't know about this.

4614
03:09:14,660 --> 03:09:15,060
2009.

4615
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:17,740
Don't worry.

4616
03:09:17,800 --> 03:09:18,840
You didn't read this one yet.

4617
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:19,340
Don't worry.

4618
03:09:19,520 --> 03:09:20,640
I got your back, Doki.

4619
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:21,560
A fire!

4620
03:09:21,720 --> 03:09:22,520
Thank you for the super chat.

4621
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:22,860
Thank you.

4622
03:09:22,900 --> 03:09:23,440
Thank you.

4623
03:09:24,740 --> 03:09:26,780
I'm surprised I actually didn't know about this.

4624
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:30,160
Doki's got brain rot.

4625
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:32,160
Johnny Lacombe, thank you for the super chat.

4626
03:09:32,240 --> 03:09:32,520
Thank you.

4627
03:09:32,540 --> 03:09:33,160
Thank you.

4628
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:34,520
Oh, not super chat.

4629
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:35,140
Membership.

4630
03:09:35,140 --> 03:09:36,400
Thank you for the gifted membership.

4631
03:09:36,620 --> 03:09:36,920
Thank you.

4632
03:09:36,940 --> 03:09:37,440
Thank you.

4633
03:09:38,600 --> 03:09:38,980
Uh...

4634
03:09:38,980 --> 03:09:41,400
It's like I know a lot of, like, internet shit.

4635
03:09:41,460 --> 03:09:46,660
So I'm really surprised I actually don't know about the fucking Burger King SpongeBob.

4636
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:49,300
I think they phased out the Burger King, man.

4637
03:09:49,300 --> 03:09:53,120
Because they realized that, like, he's a little... freaky.

4638
03:09:53,380 --> 03:09:54,860
Because I don't see him anymore.

4639
03:09:54,960 --> 03:10:00,000
They phased out a lot of, like, the fast food mascots because we don't see Ronald McDonald anymore.

4640
03:10:00,300 --> 03:10:09,200
We don't see... Okay, to be fair, the reason why we don't see Ronald McDonald anymore is because at one point in history, we had a killer clown phase.

4641
03:10:09,460 --> 03:10:14,780
Where, like, people were randomly dressed up as clowns at night to just freak people out.

4642
03:10:15,020 --> 03:10:19,420
So then the McDon... the Ronald McDonald's company was like, We are gonna make sure...

4643
03:10:19,420 --> 03:10:27,020
The McDonald's company slowly phased out Ronald McDonald because of the whole, like, clowns dressed up...

4644
03:10:27,020 --> 03:10:29,340
Like... like creepy clowns dressed up at night.

4645
03:10:29,660 --> 03:10:30,080
Yeah!

4646
03:10:30,360 --> 03:10:30,880
Yeah!

4647
03:10:30,920 --> 03:10:31,340
Yeah!

4648
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:40,360
And then at one point, it got really bad because serial killers were starting to dress up like the clowns.

4649
03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:42,320
Because they think they could get away with it.

4650
03:10:42,560 --> 03:10:47,900
So there was an actual serial killer that dressed up as the clowns.

4651
03:10:47,900 --> 03:10:49,060
At night.

4652
03:10:49,320 --> 03:10:52,940
Because they were like, Oh, other people are dressing up as clowns at night.

4653
03:10:53,160 --> 03:10:54,760
So they'll just think I'm a prankster.

4654
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,980
So then... so then people were... stopped doing it.

4655
03:10:58,100 --> 03:11:00,060
Because they're like, Oh my God!

4656
03:11:03,240 --> 03:11:05,160
Maybe we should stop.

4657
03:11:05,540 --> 03:11:09,160
Because actual serial killers were using it.

4658
03:11:09,380 --> 03:11:14,400
So then... then it just... the whole clowns at night thing just suddenly stopped happening.

4659
03:11:14,780 --> 03:11:16,100
That was fun actually...

4660
03:11:16,100 --> 03:11:17,300
No, it was not fun!

4661
03:11:17,300 --> 03:11:22,100
Because actual murderers started getting involved guys!

4662
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,100
Actual murderers started getting involved.

4663
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:27,860
So then it stopped.

4664
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:28,920
Yeah.

4665
03:11:33,020 --> 03:11:36,420
And like... and then I remember there was like that other... the Jack guy.

4666
03:11:36,520 --> 03:11:37,420
Was it Jack in the Box?

4667
03:11:37,700 --> 03:11:39,500
Oh, I love the Jack in the Box guy though.

4668
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:44,580
I miss... I miss the Jack in the Box commercials.

4669
03:11:44,800 --> 03:11:46,280
Because I actually thought he was like...

4670
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:47,620
The commercials with that guy.

4671
03:11:47,820 --> 03:11:48,420
Who is he?

4672
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:49,200
Okay...

4673
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:53,520
Um... he was a guy that wore this giant white head with a cone hat.

4674
03:11:54,260 --> 03:11:56,680
Um... I don't see Jack in the Box guy anymore.

4675
03:11:57,780 --> 03:11:58,500
To be fair.

4676
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:00,520
Jack in the Box guy is kinda hot.

4677
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:03,980
It's just because he wears a suit doesn't mean he's hot.

4678
03:12:04,460 --> 03:12:05,740
Guys, I swear...

4679
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:10,820
I swear anytime some random guy wears a suit, people will be like, but he's hot.

4680
03:12:10,980 --> 03:12:13,060
But then you... like he doesn't even show the face.

4681
03:12:13,180 --> 03:12:14,820
It's like they'll just put a helmet... like...

4682
03:12:14,820 --> 03:12:16,260
It's like they just put a helmet on him.

4683
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:18,880
And then you guys will be like, oh my god, he's so hot.

4684
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:20,300
Just because he has a suit on.

4685
03:12:21,500 --> 03:12:23,440
The mask stays on.

4686
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:28,460
Okay, but here we...

4687
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:31,500
It's always a damn suit.

4688
03:12:33,340 --> 03:12:35,460
Only if the suit is well tailored.

4689
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:38,160
You don't want somebody to wear a suit...

4690
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:40,220
Um... that's like oversized.

4691
03:12:40,580 --> 03:12:41,720
Or like too...

4692
03:12:41,720 --> 03:12:42,340
Okay, to be fair.

4693
03:12:42,400 --> 03:12:43,660
Some people will be like, no Doki.

4694
03:12:43,780 --> 03:12:45,720
If it's too tight, it's even better.

4695
03:12:45,720 --> 03:12:46,240
Doki.

4696
03:12:47,780 --> 03:12:52,400
But if you see a guy wearing a suit that's too big for him.

4697
03:12:52,560 --> 03:12:54,280
Or a girl that's wearing a suit too big for him.

4698
03:12:54,320 --> 03:12:54,940
For them.

4699
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:56,240
It's not... not hot.

4700
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:00,300
Um...

4701
03:13:00,300 --> 03:13:01,360
The Slenderman effect.

4702
03:13:01,440 --> 03:13:02,080
That's true.

4703
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:04,600
People actually thought Slenderman was hot.

4704
03:13:05,380 --> 03:13:07,840
I mean, there was a whole shit about like...

4705
03:13:07,840 --> 03:13:11,460
Those kids that murdered because they were trying to murder for Slenderman.

4706
03:13:11,580 --> 03:13:12,600
That was so fucked up.

4707
03:13:12,780 --> 03:13:13,920
I remember people...

4708
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:15,040
Yeah, some...

4709
03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:16,000
Yeah, it's the...

4710
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:16,660
There was...

4711
03:13:16,660 --> 03:13:18,280
I don't know if people forgot about it.

4712
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:20,080
There was like two little girls.

4713
03:13:20,360 --> 03:13:22,880
Two little girls like murdered their...

4714
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:25,220
Like tried to murder their friend.

4715
03:13:25,920 --> 03:13:26,880
Real by the way.

4716
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:27,860
This is a real story.

4717
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:31,100
Two little girls tried to murder their friend.

4718
03:13:31,500 --> 03:13:32,740
For Slenderman.

4719
03:13:32,980 --> 03:13:35,480
Because they were like, we have to do it for Slenderman.

4720
03:13:35,600 --> 03:13:36,340
To summon him.

4721
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:37,660
And shit like that.

4722
03:13:37,880 --> 03:13:40,960
And then that's why Slenderman isn't talked about anymore.

4723
03:13:41,380 --> 03:13:42,400
It's like...

4724
03:13:43,100 --> 03:13:48,060
It's like when murder gets involved, people just stop talking about it.

4725
03:13:48,100 --> 03:13:49,400
Because they're like, this is a...

4726
03:13:49,400 --> 03:13:51,040
This is pretty bad.

4727
03:13:53,500 --> 03:13:54,900
No, it wasn't a...

4728
03:13:54,900 --> 03:13:56,060
It actually happened.

4729
03:13:56,320 --> 03:13:57,180
She survived.

4730
03:13:57,360 --> 03:13:58,920
Yeah, it was attempted murder.

4731
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,200
They were like 12 years old.

4732
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:01,780
Yeah, yeah.

4733
03:14:01,980 --> 03:14:02,920
And then like...

4734
03:14:02,920 --> 03:14:05,140
Because Slenderman was like really popular.

4735
03:14:05,620 --> 03:14:07,280
It was like super popular.

4736
03:14:07,540 --> 03:14:08,860
And then that happened.

4737
03:14:09,040 --> 03:14:11,640
And then nobody really talks about Slenderman anymore.

4738
03:14:11,640 --> 03:14:13,280
Nobody talks.

4739
03:14:13,540 --> 03:14:14,560
Because they're like, whoa.

4740
03:14:15,140 --> 03:14:16,680
Maybe we should stop.

4741
03:14:18,400 --> 03:14:19,620
Oh my god.

4742
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:23,440
Yeah, it was fucking crazy.

4743
03:14:23,860 --> 03:14:25,100
That was a crazy time.

4744
03:14:25,480 --> 03:14:28,940
And that's why Slenderman just suddenly stopped happening.

4745
03:14:29,320 --> 03:14:32,160
Like people just stopped talking about Slenderman.

4746
03:14:32,420 --> 03:14:35,520
Because people were like, holy fuck.

4747
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:36,600
Wait.

4748
03:14:37,220 --> 03:14:40,100
There's real murders happening now.

4749
03:14:40,960 --> 03:14:42,260
Like the clown shit.

4750
03:14:42,420 --> 03:14:46,140
That's why people stopped fucking dressing up as clowns at night time.

4751
03:14:46,480 --> 03:14:50,120
Because murderers were like, I'm gonna start dressing up as a clown too.

4752
03:14:50,460 --> 03:14:54,300
Because nobody can catch me if everybody else is dressed up as a clown.

4753
03:14:55,740 --> 03:14:56,940
Sleepy, thank you for the super chat.

4754
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:57,860
Thank you, thank you.

4755
03:14:58,200 --> 03:15:00,500
Usni, I refuse to accept the slander.

4756
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:03,100
They sell a thirst trap calendar on the official...

4757
03:15:03,100 --> 03:15:03,840
Wait, what?

4758
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:07,240
Jack in the box calendar.

4759
03:15:07,560 --> 03:15:08,660
Are you serious?

4760
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,040
Oh my god.

4761
03:15:11,720 --> 03:15:12,200
Wait.

4762
03:15:17,540 --> 03:15:18,940
Wait a minute.

4763
03:15:20,100 --> 03:15:21,100
Oh my god.

4764
03:15:21,160 --> 03:15:23,060
Wait, he was not joking.

4765
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:25,520
2024.

4766
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:28,040
Wait, I'm gonna put this on my screen.

4767
03:15:28,620 --> 03:15:29,340
Oh my...

4768
03:15:29,340 --> 03:15:31,320
Guys, it's like the fireman shit.

4769
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:33,580
But for like fast food.

4770
03:15:34,440 --> 03:15:35,840
Okay, I'm gonna put this on my screen.

4771
03:15:36,160 --> 03:15:37,040
You guys need to see this.

4772
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:38,500
This is actually crazy.

4773
03:15:38,540 --> 03:15:39,160
What the fuck?

4774
03:15:39,320 --> 03:15:40,020
This is actually crazy.

4775
03:15:40,020 --> 03:15:40,680
This is actually...

4776
03:15:40,680 --> 03:15:43,100
Wait, this is actually real.

4777
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:45,080
Look at this.

4778
03:15:45,860 --> 03:15:47,380
Jack's thirst trap.

4779
03:15:48,100 --> 03:15:51,020
You weren't familiar with this game.

4780
03:15:53,400 --> 03:15:54,940
Wait, he has a ring on.

4781
03:15:55,180 --> 03:15:56,960
Is that a wedding ring, Jack?

4782
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:58,080
How dare you?

4783
03:15:58,300 --> 03:15:59,820
How dare you?

4784
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,480
Wait, is Jack in the box?

4785
03:16:04,400 --> 03:16:05,460
Is that the wedding?

4786
03:16:05,480 --> 03:16:06,280
Is that the wedding hat?

4787
03:16:06,420 --> 03:16:06,940
I don't know.

4788
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:09,020
Jack in the box.

4789
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:09,440
Jack's married.

4790
03:16:12,660 --> 03:16:13,500
He's married?

4791
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:15,120
Cricket?

4792
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:16,380
Who is she?

4793
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:18,780
Jack...

4794
03:16:20,100 --> 03:16:21,780
Jack's wife.

4795
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:23,400
Cricket.

4796
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:26,820
Jack in the box.

4797
03:16:27,640 --> 03:16:29,660
How dare he be married?

4798
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:32,280
No way.

4799
03:16:36,860 --> 03:16:38,020
I can't.

4800
03:16:39,020 --> 03:16:39,580
Oh my God.

4801
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:42,320
His wife doesn't even have the head.

4802
03:16:43,100 --> 03:16:44,240
What the fuck?

4803
03:16:44,260 --> 03:16:46,720
The wife is just a regular person.

4804
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:49,920
So that we can all be like the wife.

4805
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:51,420
Wait, what the fuck?

4806
03:16:51,480 --> 03:16:53,760
The wife is just a regular person.

4807
03:16:55,420 --> 03:16:56,620
Oh my God.

4808
03:16:57,280 --> 03:16:59,000
I can't believe it.

4809
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:01,680
He has kids too.

4810
03:17:02,220 --> 03:17:03,940
I can't believe it.

4811
03:17:03,980 --> 03:17:06,360
How could Jack do this to us?

4812
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:09,000
Did you ask him?

4813
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:12,380
I thought it'd be like another person with the head.

4814
03:17:14,780 --> 03:17:15,780
Oh my God.

4815
03:17:15,800 --> 03:17:19,120
There was a petition to nominate him for people's sexiest man alive.

4816
03:17:19,680 --> 03:17:20,800
Wait, what?

4817
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:25,560
Make Jackbox people's sexiest man alive.

4818
03:17:26,580 --> 03:17:27,940
Wait, what?

4819
03:17:28,900 --> 03:17:30,000
What is this?

4820
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:32,440
Wait, this is from the official TikTok.

4821
03:17:32,800 --> 03:17:34,520
Oh my God.

4822
03:17:35,080 --> 03:17:35,760
Bro.

4823
03:17:36,900 --> 03:17:37,240
What?

4824
03:17:37,580 --> 03:17:38,080
When?

4825
03:17:38,080 --> 03:17:39,840
Guys, look at this.

4826
03:17:49,180 --> 03:17:51,860
Wait, this is real.

4827
03:17:53,120 --> 03:17:54,220
Oh my God.

4828
03:17:54,380 --> 03:17:55,120
What the fuck?

4829
03:17:55,460 --> 03:17:57,860
We're looking at Jack from Jack and the Bugs.

4830
03:17:57,900 --> 03:17:58,520
Look at this one.

4831
03:17:58,680 --> 03:17:59,140
I think I'm...

4832
03:18:02,520 --> 03:18:03,560
Holy shit.

4833
03:18:04,500 --> 03:18:05,020
Okay.

4834
03:18:05,280 --> 03:18:09,940
Is someone's gonna break the mode of what society thinks is sexy?

4835
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:10,580
Or...

4836
03:18:10,600 --> 03:18:11,640
Why not Jack?

4837
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:15,920
Let's make Jackbox the official sexiest man alive.

4838
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:17,680
Oh my God.

4839
03:18:17,800 --> 03:18:18,680
I don't know if...

4840
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:24,280
I did not intend to go down the Jack in the Box rabbit hole, guys.

4841
03:18:24,720 --> 03:18:25,320
I...

4842
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:26,800
Well, hello there.

4843
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:27,520
Damn.

4844
03:18:28,860 --> 03:18:30,840
Jack is fucking ripped.

4845
03:18:33,060 --> 03:18:34,660
He is looking good.

4846
03:18:34,940 --> 03:18:38,240
Bro, is anybody ordering Jack in the Box tonight, guys?

4847
03:18:38,240 --> 03:18:41,120
Who is ordering some Jack in the Box, guys?

4848
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:42,240
Okay.

4849
03:18:43,280 --> 03:18:44,540
Let me check out...

4850
03:18:44,540 --> 03:18:45,240
Oh my God.

4851
03:18:45,300 --> 03:18:47,260
Bro, he has a Funko Pop too?

4852
03:18:47,840 --> 03:18:50,040
Jack in the Box has a Funko Pop and I don't.

4853
03:18:52,620 --> 03:18:55,180
Okay, I need to know what other pictures are on this.

4854
03:18:55,580 --> 03:18:56,020
Looking...

4855
03:18:56,020 --> 03:18:57,580
Oh my God.

4856
03:18:58,380 --> 03:18:59,840
What the fuck am I...

4857
03:18:59,840 --> 03:19:00,440
Okay, guys.

4858
03:19:00,520 --> 03:19:01,740
You guys gotta see the calendar.

4859
03:19:02,060 --> 03:19:06,580
Here's like some of the preview pictures that I saw here.

4860
03:19:07,020 --> 03:19:07,940
I'm gonna save this.

4861
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:08,220
Oh my God.

4862
03:19:10,660 --> 03:19:12,480
I need to save this for you guys.

4863
03:19:12,620 --> 03:19:12,800
Okay.

4864
03:19:13,060 --> 03:19:13,760
Look at this.

4865
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:17,040
Okay, whoever took photos of this, they know what they're...

4866
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:18,420
They know the target audience.

4867
03:19:23,420 --> 03:19:23,860
Why?

4868
03:19:24,440 --> 03:19:27,080
Why is he so damn ripped?

4869
03:19:29,140 --> 03:19:29,580
Damn.

4870
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:32,680
This has to be for like October.

4871
03:19:32,740 --> 03:19:33,300
I don't know.

4872
03:19:33,380 --> 03:19:33,940
I forgot.

4873
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:34,900
What's American Thanksgiving?

4874
03:19:35,560 --> 03:19:37,400
Whatever American Thanksgiving is.

4875
03:19:37,760 --> 03:19:38,200
I don't know.

4876
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:38,680
That is...

4877
03:19:38,680 --> 03:19:39,480
There you go.

4878
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:40,020
There's Jack.

4879
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:41,180
Oh my.

4880
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:44,380
Look at those curly fries.

4881
03:19:47,420 --> 03:19:48,200
All right.

4882
03:19:48,300 --> 03:19:50,380
I think that's a good time to call it here, guys.

4883
03:19:51,780 --> 03:19:55,540
I had a great time talking to you guys and also playing Sand Land today.

4884
03:19:56,980 --> 03:20:03,980
I can't believe we spent majority of that customizing our town, but at least we finished one of the dungeons for the...

4885
03:20:04,580 --> 03:20:07,280
One out of the three dungeons for Greenland.

4886
03:20:07,520 --> 03:20:08,120
Hey, guys.

4887
03:20:08,120 --> 03:20:12,060
Guys, tomorrow we have Minecraft Twitch Rivals on Sunday.

4888
03:20:12,640 --> 03:20:14,260
But next week is also more chill.

4889
03:20:14,360 --> 03:20:16,280
We do have like, I think like one collab.

4890
03:20:16,380 --> 03:20:17,760
I moved around my collabs.

4891
03:20:17,820 --> 03:20:19,880
Because we originally have collabs next week.

4892
03:20:19,920 --> 03:20:23,180
But then like, I want to relax and chill after WrestleTuber.

4893
03:20:23,420 --> 03:20:25,400
But I haven't had a chance to really relax.

4894
03:20:25,680 --> 03:20:28,000
Because it has been like back to back to back events lately.

4895
03:20:28,980 --> 03:20:30,860
So, it's gonna be like Sajam Slam.

4896
03:20:31,600 --> 03:20:32,400
Then WrestleTuber.

4897
03:20:32,740 --> 03:20:35,000
And then like a lot of collabs and stuff in between.

4898
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,840
So like, we're taking next week really chill.

4899
03:20:38,060 --> 03:20:40,860
But tomorrow will be a Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

4900
03:20:42,620 --> 03:20:47,040
And if I... it really depends on like how far I make it in the Twitch Rivals.

4901
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:49,840
Because it's like... it's supposed to be like a 5-6 day event.

4902
03:20:50,020 --> 03:20:51,760
Only if you don't get eliminated.

4903
03:20:52,140 --> 03:20:54,620
So like each day they start... they eliminate people.

4904
03:20:54,800 --> 03:20:56,220
So there's a lot of people participating.

4905
03:20:56,620 --> 03:20:59,440
I think like more than 100 content creators are participating.

4906
03:21:00,720 --> 03:21:02,780
I'll put a waiting room up so you guys can see.

4907
03:21:03,020 --> 03:21:03,640
Oh wait, no.

4908
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:04,640
JK, it's on Twitch.

4909
03:21:05,840 --> 03:21:07,320
I'll give you guys the time on Twitter.

4910
03:21:07,480 --> 03:21:11,880
So follow me on Twitter so you guys know what time it is for the Twitch Rivals.

4911
03:21:12,420 --> 03:21:14,140
Because I'll be streaming on Twitch.

4912
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:18,180
Anyway guys, as always everybody stay hydrated, posture check.

4913
03:21:18,260 --> 03:21:19,980
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4914
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:22,000
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

4915
03:21:22,160 --> 03:21:23,260
Because you deserve it.

4916
03:21:23,340 --> 03:21:24,320
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4917
03:21:24,760 --> 03:21:25,360
Bye guys.

4918
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:26,200
Bye!
