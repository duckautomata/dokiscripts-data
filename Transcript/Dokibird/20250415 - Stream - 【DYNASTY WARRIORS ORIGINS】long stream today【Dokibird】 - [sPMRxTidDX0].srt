1
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,470
Good morning.

2
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,630
I am... I am alive, unfortunately.

3
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,130
Oh my god.

4
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,490
Those 30 streams are the bane of my existence.

5
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,610
Oh my god, sorry, I forgot to turn this off.

6
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,290
Oh my god, okay.

7
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,130
Give me a second.

8
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,490
Oh my god, right now.

9
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,830
Okay.

10
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,670
I'm not... I'm never a person at 12.30.

11
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,570
Sorry, I've been like... I realize I've been consistently late at 12.30.

12
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,690
But I've also been like, not sleeping early at 12.30.

13
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,610
Which is my fault, honestly.

14
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,110
It is... it is my fault.

15
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,030
I've been consistently late for these streams, for this time slot.

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,130
But I've also have not been sleeping at a correct time at this hour, this time slot.

17
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,430
I'm sorry, guys.

18
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,190
Why did I sleep late?

19
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,990
I was just working.

20
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,110
I was just catching up to a lot of work stuff.

21
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,150
And...

22
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,210
And I've just been like, you know...

23
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,650
Just... I don't know what else to say.

24
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,670
I've been trying to catch up to a lot of work stuff.

25
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,290
And I literally... because I was like, you know, answering messages and stuff last night.

26
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,970
To like, some of the build up messages that I've like, left like, rotting.

27
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,670
Not rotting, sorry, I shouldn't use that word.

28
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,110
Left like, in my...

29
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,150
Left like, unanswered for a couple of days in my... in my Discord.

30
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,490
And then, I literally was like, just answering all of them, one by one.

31
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,450
Not all of them, there's still a lot more.

32
00:03:52,670 --> 00:04:04,110
And then, I wake up, and then I received 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 DMs from...

33
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,910
12... 12 DMs from 12 different people.

34
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,890
I woke up.

35
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,150
From like, some of the replies I got from people.

36
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,810
So I'm like, can't wait for another hard day of work today.

37
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,510
Okay.

38
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,350
And like, I have like, server messages too.

39
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:33,810
Alright.

40
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,540
Okay.

41
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,420
Let me see, sorry, I'm just... just reading.

42
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm just...

43
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,400
Reading... reading a message.

44
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,810
Okay, give me a sec.

45
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,130
Okay.

46
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,160
Alright,

47
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,780
there you go.

48
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,680
I have to answer... I have to answer a message real quick.

49
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Sorry, my brain is not working at the moment.

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,180
My brain is actually... I'm not a... I'm not a functioning human being.

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,580
This time, I'm like, oh my god, what do I do with this?

52
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,880
Oh my god, Time Citizen, breakfast, it's just a cat, multitask, I can barely multitask when I'm a functioning human being.

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,520
A little...

54
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,740
You can read?

55
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,240
Unfortunately, yes.

56
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,140
Unfortunately, I can't... I have to be able to read to progress in my life.

57
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,320
Which is very unfortunate.

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,540
Alright, give me a... let me boot up... let me boot up Dynasty Warriors today.

59
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:28,340
I told my manager that I'm finally going to do a long, very long stream of Dynasty Warriors today.

60
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Because I don't want to play this game until like 2026.

61
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,920
And then my manager was like, thank fucking god.

62
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,840
And then he was like, this is the Yakuza of your stream.

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,410
And I was like, what do you mean?

64
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,710
Because he was like, because Yakuza is like incredibly long.

65
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,250
And he was like, this is the death sentence of your channel.

66
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,870
And I was like, I was like, what?

67
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,270
Because he was like, you can't keep, you can't keep playing Dynasty Warriors, Derky.

68
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,710
You have, you have to, you have to play...

69
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,930
You have to play other games.

70
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,050
You have to start a new series, Derky.

71
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,670
And I was like, okay.

72
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,470
I'll try to do...

73
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,110
I'll do a long stream today.

74
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:55,950
So, because like, because, because the game is incredibly long.

75
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,590
And I still haven't yet to finish One Kingdom.

76
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:11,310
There is a high chance that if I am not close to finishing this fucking game by the end of today.

77
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,570
Of my long stream today.

78
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,530
I, for Wu and Wei, I will move it to Twitch.

79
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,530
For the retirement home of, the retirement home of games.

80
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:33,590
I'll move Wu and Wei to Twitch and finish Xu on YouTube.

81
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,390
No, I thought it would be over.

82
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,830
What do you mean?

83
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,950
You're still gonna go.

84
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,210
After Xu.

85
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,850
Look, look.

86
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,250
I wanna know.

87
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,230
Okay, I know what happens.

88
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,730
In the storyline of Wu and Wei.

89
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:07,470
But like, I don't know what happens to me in the storyline of Wu and Wei.

90
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,670
Also, life update.

91
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,290
Oh yeah, Twitch VODs channel is still alive.

92
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,670
I just, I've been so busy.

93
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,530
But I'm gonna, I'm gonna pawn over the VODs channel to one of my staff members.

94
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,850
To like, update the VODs and stuff.

95
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,550
Because they are much more reliable than me, obviously.

96
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,950
Anyway, what was I gonna say?

97
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,290
Oh yeah, not life update, but funny update.

98
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:50,410
So, one of my friends was asking me if I wanted to join this like, supposedly a VTuber Rivals tournament.

99
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,810
But then I was like, I looked at it and I was like, are you sure?

100
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,070
There's no rules.

101
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,010
But it's because it's hosted by a VTuber.

102
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,810
But I was like, are you sure this is a VTuber tournament?

103
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,850
Because there are no rules against non-VTuber.

104
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,210
And then my friend is not a VTuber who recommended me to join this tournament.

105
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,530
So then I was like, are you sure it is a primarily VTuber tournament?

106
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,190
And then I was looking through it, because I was like, no rank limits.

107
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,450
So like, the thing is, the tournament had zero rank limits.

108
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:35,790
So the last VTuber tournament I participated in, obviously there was a rank limit to it to make sure it's like, equal or fair.

109
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,470
But like, for this one, they didn't even impose a rank limit.

110
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,730
So I was like, so you could technically bring an entire team of top 500 to this tournament.

111
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,190
But it was, majority of it were VTubers, because I was looking through the teams.

112
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,350
And it has a public list of teams and like, attendees, and you can still sign up.

113
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,470
And... okay.

114
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:08,370
It was so funny, because I was looking through it, and they're all like, regular teams of like, people I don't recognize.

115
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,290
But they're like, VTubers, and they're like, and I looked through it.

116
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,490
And then, at the last page, there's Luminosity's entire pro roster.

117
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,970
And I was like, bro, you're gonna get so shit on.

118
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:36,290
There's like, one entire pro team in this random ass, quote unquote, VTuber tournament.

119
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,690
I was like, what the fuck is Luminosity doing here?

120
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,440
It's so fucking deep.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,460
And I was like, scrolling through, and I was like, excuse me?

122
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,060
And I sent it to my friend, I was like, do you know Luminosity is in this tournament?

123
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,280
And obviously my friend was like, what the fuck are they doing here?

124
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,310
Like, first place is...

125
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,280
$600, which means each player gets like, $100 each.

126
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,520
So I was like, the fuck are you doing here?

127
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,450
That's so funny, I was like, oh my god.

128
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,400
So like, here, I'll show you.

129
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,980
Like, literally, like, what is Luminosity doing here?

130
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,760
All of that for $100.

131
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,680
It's like, it's broke.

132
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,640
That's so, oh my god.

133
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,540
I was like, literally, the entire roster, all the other teams were literally just regular people.

134
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,640
Like, who are you?

135
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,740
Why are you here?

136
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,060
Why are you here?

137
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,340
Majority said people in this tournament were just VTubers.

138
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,480
They don't even have, it's like their entire pro team.

139
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,660
I see some of these people in rank.

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,740
Like, they're pros, they really need them.

141
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,440
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

142
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,040
But like, how did they find out about this tournament?

143
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:35,560
I also, so then my friend was like, my friend was like, what the, but they're not, they're like, pros like, they're not that good.

144
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,160
And I was like, bro, you're literally the only top 500 player on your team.

145
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,680
Like, you're, yeah, like, yeah, to you they're not that good.

146
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,980
But you have five other people that have not reached your, have never played in your ELO.

147
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,680
Sure, buddy, sure.

148
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:16,520
I was like, I just thought it was so, literally, literally, the first three, the three pages are like, VTubers.

149
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,780
It's like, they're like, VTubers.

150
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,320
Luminosity.

151
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:38,920
So, so I don't know, I don't know if they're, I don't think they're, I don't know, I don't, I have a suspicion that my friend's team might not be first place.

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,120
Might not win first place.

153
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,380
I don't know, just like, a suspicion there.

154
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,760
Because they have no other rules.

155
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,660
It's literally no rank limits.

156
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Anyone can join, but it's hosted by a VTuber.

157
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:03,060
So, like, so it's like, you don't have to be a VTuber to join this tournament.

158
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,600
So you can literally sign up your entire pro fucking team to be part of it.

159
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,220
I don't know, I don't know what tournament it is.

160
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
I got, I got asked to join the team and I saw that and I was like, no.

161
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,000
I was like, unless we bring our own fucking one above all team, we are not, I am not fighting Luminosity.

162
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm not fucking fighting Luminosity.

163
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,340
Alright, here we go.

164
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm booting up Dynasty Warriors.

165
00:15:44,700 --> 00:16:00,000
And the thing is, I found out another, another, like, when I told my friend about Luminosity's joining, one of their team, one of his teammates was like, oh yeah, BlankPerson is also bringing a team.

166
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,500
And I was like, bro, you know that, and I was like, I'm not gonna say who it was, who's, who the person is that they're talking about.

167
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,260
And I was like, but I know who that, like, me and my other friend knows, like, what type of person he is.

168
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,860
And I was like, bro, you know that guy's gonna bring an entire pro roster too.

169
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,660
Good fucking luck, bro.

170
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,780
He's not gonna bring someone below Eternity.

171
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,900
And he's also not a VTuber that's joining that tournament.

172
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,220
I was like, you know that guy's gonna bring entire, like, full roster of Eternity players, man.

173
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,920
Like...

174
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,540
I was like, good fucking luck.

175
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,540
I know, like, the end game is that team and Luminosity.

176
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,960
Alright, let me set my volume up real quick.

177
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, back at it again.

178
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
A long day of Dynasty Warriors.

179
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,940
Alright, continue.

180
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,620
Not Doki.

181
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,140
Easy $600.

182
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,500
My second favorite Chinese person?

183
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,280
Who's your first?

184
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,320
Like, what do you mean?

185
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,660
Someone in chat was like, yippee, my second favorite Chinese person.

186
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
Alright, let's look at my letters.

187
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
I forgot to read my letters.

188
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,040
I skipped all my letters to read a letter from Zhuge Liang.

189
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,260
Alright, let's read my first super chat of the day.

190
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,060
Oh, okay, never mind.

191
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,220
That's not a super chat.

192
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,080
Who cares?

193
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,540
Let's go through my fan mail.

194
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,300
Do not Doki.

195
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
Oh wait, I forgot I'm supposed to be left side Doki.

196
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,220
It's been a while, guys.

197
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,120
Give me a sec.

198
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,260
Let me bring left side Doki over here.

199
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,000
Where the fuck did I put left side Doki?

200
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
It's been so long.

201
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,500
That's not left side.

202
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,420
That's not left side.

203
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh my god, where is left side Doki?

204
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,260
Did I accidentally delete her?

205
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,220
Oh wait.

206
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,540
Wait, where is she?

207
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,340
Where did she go?

208
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,560
Oh no, guys, left side Doki might be gone.

209
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, there she is.

210
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,800
Alright, there's left side Doki.

211
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,080
Alright, left is... I snapped her out of existence.

212
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,340
Do not fear.

213
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,980
I am someone that you can trust.

214
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,680
My name is Xun You.

215
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,260
Please spare me a moment of your time to make things clear.

216
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,420
There is something that I must discuss with you.

217
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:56,060
Also, like, I realized that maybe we would progress more in this game if I stopped, like, making new admires.

218
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,000
If I wasn't trying to increase my harem, I might have finished this game earlier.

219
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,940
Guan Yin!

220
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,600
Not Doki, I'll get straight to the point.

221
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
Can you assist us in Shrew Province?

222
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,920
I know that path we tread is one of great...

223
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,120
Oh wait, no, what the fuck?

224
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,080
Okay, that's just... I've done that already.

225
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,300
I hate Not Doki.

226
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
I got something for you today.

227
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,460
Just holding it in your hands is sure to put the spring of victory in your step.

228
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,840
It's quite a precious and rare find, after all.

229
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,680
So do me a favor and try not to go hawking it off to the nearest shop.

230
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,200
At least not before I get the chance to see you wield it.

231
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,240
Oh, a gift!

232
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm in.

233
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm in.

234
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,160
You got me a gift, guys.

235
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,620
Zhilong, I noticed that your eyes are frequently drawn to fire.

236
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,620
I'm right here.

237
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,780
Why do you always need to send me a letter?

238
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm literally sitting right beside you.

239
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,060
It's like those people who, like, text you when you're, like, in the same room.

240
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,660
I'm like, bro, I'm in the same room with you.

241
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,300
Why just tell me?

242
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
Why do you have to text me this?

243
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,240
You almost always cry out in your sleep.

244
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,060
Now I can only guess, but this may have something to do with a tragic event involving fire in your forgotten past.

245
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
This is what I was thinking anyway, but I can't be sure.

246
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,460
You know, I was watching you cooking by the fire the other day when you took a roasted sweet potato.

247
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,140
And you used your requisite knife hand technique to chop it into three.

248
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,860
And it went and gobbled it all up yourself.

249
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,860
I was so sure that you would share it too.

250
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,100
Next time you roast sweet potatoes, lease some for me as well.

251
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,120
Yeah, and who is supporting you through all of this?

252
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,140
Who is paying for the sweet potato, Yun, huh?

253
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,900
You have not contributed to that right in five years.

254
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,340
Please, I, like, I, my paycheck does not cover two people.

255
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,100
Okay, I have a favor to ask of you.

256
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,780
Lord Sun Tzu is currently living as a vassal of Yun Shu.

257
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,360
I hope to be by his side during these troubled times, but seems there isn't enough room at the table for a man of my size.

258
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,820
That's where you come in.

259
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,160
I want you to check in on things there for me.

260
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,360
My friend, you are the only one I can trust with this task.

261
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,180
Alright, Yun Shu versus the Sun family.

262
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,080
I have a favor to ask from you.

263
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,560
Will you come to Xiao Pei?

264
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,920
We need your help defending Shu province from Yun Shu's forces.

265
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,900
With the Sun forces on your side, they are a formidable foe.

266
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
I feel much better we have you with us.

267
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,680
I implore you, please come to our aid.

268
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,500
Welp, sorry Hong Gai.

269
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,960
Today is a Shu run.

270
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,100
Today.

271
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
So I have to join Lu Bei.

272
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,480
Sorry, buddy.

273
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,700
Um, Medi!

274
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
Thank you for the super chat.

275
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,820
Thank you, thank you.

276
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,780
It's okay, Doki.

277
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,000
You're a number one Chinese person to me.

278
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,360
Thank you for the super chat.

279
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,380
Thank you.

280
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,460
At least I'm number one in somebody's heart.

281
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,680
Alright.

282
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,120
Oh, it's him.

283
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,220
I forgot his name.

284
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,860
It's Axeman.

285
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,800
That's me!

286
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,900
Yeah, it's me.

287
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,240
Something I- yeah, something I can do for you?

288
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,320
Yeah?

289
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,020
Have you heard about my harem?

290
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm like, who the fuck is that guy?

291
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,760
Who's he?

292
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,660
Oh.

293
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,760
Wait, he's the leader?

294
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,960
What do you want me to do?

295
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,560
Kill him?

296
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
That doesn't come for cheap.

297
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,040
You know that, right?

298
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,580
Okay.

299
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh wait, he is asking me to kill him.

300
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,560
Okay.

301
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,560
Don't worry.

302
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,680
I'll do it for at least one dollar.

303
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,220
And an extra person for my harem.

304
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,780
Hmm.

305
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,140
Oh.

306
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,920
Lu Bei.

307
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,760
Oh!

308
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,800
Okay.

309
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,100
Definitely Lu Bei.

310
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,360
He's not incompetent or anything.

311
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,160
Yeah.

312
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,020
So honorable.

313
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,740
Lu Bei is like the perfect politician.

314
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,180
He says so many things and then does nothing.

315
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,380
He's actually like the most- I said Lu Bei!

316
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,520
Oh, I have to give everybody a choice?

317
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,300
Oh, I have to pick- because he joins Cao Cao's army in the end.

318
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,720
So I just had to pick one for him.

319
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,320
What about Lu Bei?

320
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,480
Did you not like listen to what I said about Lu Bei?

321
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,940
He's just like, um, hmm.

322
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,960
Maybe not Lu Bei.

323
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,780
Is there any other choices?

324
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,580
He's like, pass.

325
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,300
And I say it again, I'm like, Lu Bei.

326
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,020
And he's like, pass.

327
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:35,690
Cheeseburger!

328
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,710
Thank you for the super chat.

329
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,810
Thank you, thank you.

330
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,630
Another day, more time with a game where warriors try to risk you up.

331
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,650
Thank you for the super chat.

332
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,710
Thank you, thank you.

333
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,010
Alright, it's who needs to talk to me?

334
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,130
Oh, Zhao Yun!

335
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,570
Okay, Zhao Yun and Shu Province.

336
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,570
Yeah, I got it.

337
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,330
Where is Shu Province?

338
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,450
This is like the hardest part.

339
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,650
Okay, it's here.

340
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,710
So Zhao Yun should be somewhere here.

341
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,610
There you are.

342
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,910
Hello, Zhao Yun.

343
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,630
Farewell.

344
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,230
I just came over here just to meet you.

345
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,430
Please continue to train and protect Lord Lu Bei.

346
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,150
Oh, okay.

347
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,370
Perfect, evade.

348
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,970
Defeat 200 foes with spear attacks.

349
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,110
Defeat 200 foes with charge.

350
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,550
Alright.

351
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,170
It's spear attack time.

352
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,910
Alright, spear.

353
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,030
Where's my spears?

354
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,370
Lance, staff, spear.

355
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,270
Okay, I'm here for you.

356
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,450
Thank fucking God.

357
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,190
I was gonna be like a straighter guy if I do not have a strong-ass fucking spear.

358
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,190
We are not completing this.

359
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,170
We are not fucking completing this.

360
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:51,850
Alright.

361
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,790
Okay, why, why, why?

362
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,170
Okay.

363
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:54,850
Alright.

364
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,950
I shall join Lu Bei's forces.

365
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,710
Yes.

366
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,250
That's fine.

367
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,670
That's fine.

368
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,810
I will become enemy of the two other kingdoms.

369
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,430
I'm okay.

370
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,290
I've made my choice since the beginning.

371
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,430
There's only one guy in Xu's army that I want to talk to.

372
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,110
And he, and I don't care about anything else.

373
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,510
Lord Kuro says thank you for the super chat.

374
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,410
Thank you, thank you.

375
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:27,230
My services don't come cheap, Doki says, as she then asks for their little bare minimum during that time period.

376
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,590
Thank you for the super chat.

377
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,750
Thank you, thank you.

378
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,250
Look, I just need more people in my harem.

379
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,310
Yuan Shu's forces have begun an assault on us here in Xiao Pei.

380
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,630
We can assume that his goal is to take control of Xu.

381
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,830
The enemy is being led by Ji Ling, one of Yuan Shu's most trusted officers.

382
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,210
We also learned that warriors from the ranks of the Sun will be fighting on their side.

383
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,550
I'm going to beat up your future wife, Lu Bei.

384
00:27:51,550 --> 00:28:01,790
I heard that after Lord Sun Jian's death, his son, Lord Sun Tse, came under the command of Yuan Shu.

385
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,390
It seems the rumors were true.

386
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,150
The enemy is formidable.

387
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,390
As the defenders of Xu, it is our duty to overcome this threat.

388
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,270
Look, if she's in the war, she's no longer a child.

389
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,070
I'm as eager to jump into battle as anyone, but it's all pointless if we lose you, brother.

390
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,310
After all, you're the only one that can protect Xu now.

391
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:25,710
Really?

392
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,870
The only one?

393
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,630
Out of everybody here, you're the only one left?

394
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,670
You never stop worrying about me, do you?

395
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,530
I'll be fine, Zhang Fei.

396
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,730
As long as I'll have all of you by my side, I know I'll come out of this alive.

397
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,970
Now, the enemy offensive is split into three parts.

398
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,830
We will deploy our forces to counter theirs in the same way.

399
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,710
One unified strength should be enough to resist Ji Ling's assault.

400
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,550
We should be wary of those from the Sun clan.

401
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,950
Sun Tse especially has lived up to his family's name as a warrior.

402
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,270
Yes, but our forces boast the likes of Guan Yun and Zhang Fei.

403
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,690
And we also have not Doki on our side.

404
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,270
That's me!

405
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,830
We will win and we will defend Xu.

406
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,590
This is for Lord Tao Tien and all the people of Xu who count on us for protection.

407
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,470
Alright, where is his future wife?

408
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,630
Alright, we're going down there.

409
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,410
Okay, that's good.

410
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,550
I'm positioned right there to just beat her up.

411
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,450
Alright, let's go.

412
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,850
Okay, we need Guan Yun.

413
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,630
Zhang Fei, I'm sorry.

414
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,790
You're never gonna be on my team.

415
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,790
Why the fuck would I choose a drunk over, like, the literal god of war?

416
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,790
Alright, I'm coming over.

417
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,690
Okay, I still remember how to play this game, I think.

418
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,490
I think I still remember how to play this game.

419
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,470
Alright, that's fine.

420
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:00,450
Then, just Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y.

421
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,730
Alright, there we go.

422
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,410
Alright, there's still one more.

423
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,430
Y, Y, Y.

424
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,850
Okay, I missed.

425
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,690
Alright, the hardest combo in this game.

426
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,590
Y, Y, oh, whoops.

427
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,610
Okay, maybe I should actually get serious.

428
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,910
Okay, nice.

429
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,250
Get outta here!

430
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,410
Get outta here!

431
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,330
You're not part of the Sun family!

432
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,590
You're the Yuan clan, bro!

433
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,490
You don't matter in history.

434
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,830
Where am I?

435
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,710
Wait, I'm up top?

436
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,850
Wait a minute, I thought I was supposed to be at the bottom.

437
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,690
Oh, it's cause I wasn't with Zhang Fei!

438
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,930
Alright, get over here.

439
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,150
Eco rights and eco lefts did not do these stories.

440
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,950
I'm heading over.

441
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,170
Sorry, give me a sec.

442
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,490
Give me a sec.

443
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,370
I'm heading straight for her.

444
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,970
Give me a sec.

445
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,050
You can hold out a little.

446
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,550
Look, I'm sorry, I have a more important mission here.

447
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,530
Get over here, lady!

448
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,250
I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

449
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,370
This is what you get for going into war!

450
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,030
Alright, don't worry, I'm over here.

451
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,950
Oh shit, okay.

452
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,030
Oh my god, oh my god, okay.

453
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,930
Okay, where are they feeding her?

454
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,830
Okay, give me a sec.

455
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,970
If I'm gonna...

456
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,270
Give me a sec, let me use an actual weapon again.

457
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,570
Alright, I'm gonna kill you with your own weapon.

458
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,190
Get outta here.

459
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,350
Get outta here.

460
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,610
Oh, you're gonna fucking run?!

461
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,590
Get over here!

462
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,250
Get your ass over here, you're gonna fucking run?!

463
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,110
Oh my god, you bitch!

464
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,090
Why is she running?!

465
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,610
What the fuck?!

466
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,390
She literally ran away!

467
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,030
Okay, that's messed up.

468
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:25,270
I literally... I literally went over here just to kill her.

469
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,590
I can't believe it.

470
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:28,710
Alright.

471
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,770
I'll take this base and then I'll head over.

472
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,790
I'll head back.

473
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:40,910
I literally left my entire army to die just to kill this child.

474
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,170
In game, in game.

475
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,010
Just, I don't want to be clipped out of context.

476
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,810
Oh my god, Lupe might actually die because I went to try and beat up a child.

477
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,070
Oh no, okay, give me a sec.

478
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,210
I'm heading back, I'm heading back.

479
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,510
Oh, that's awkward.

480
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,310
Lupe, I'm sorry, I had my priorities, okay?

481
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,410
I had my priorities.

482
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,230
I was trying to teach this child to stop going into war.

483
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,550
Oh look, your forces are routed.

484
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,310
Alright, look, it's fine, it's fine.

485
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,710
I am a hero.

486
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,410
Okay, now I can swap my weapon.

487
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,130
Where's my spear weapon?

488
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:23,830
There you go.

489
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,710
Wait, oh my god, an accident.

490
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,130
Okay, where is it again?

491
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,150
I accidentally...

492
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,330
Oh, there you go.

493
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,150
Okay.

494
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,150
Okay, why?

495
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:36,910
Why?

496
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,630
Oh my god, please.

497
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,590
Oh my god, please, I'm trying to do like the fucking...

498
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,030
You know what?

499
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,770
I don't need to.

500
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,770
I don't... Fuck this, I don't need to complete this mission.

501
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,130
I'll pay to win.

502
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,330
It's too much.

503
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,690
I'll pay to win.

504
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,290
Ow.

505
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,150
Oh my god, please.

506
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,450
Guys, it's been so long since I've played this game.

507
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,250
I'm like... I'm really rusty right now.

508
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,210
Okay, we're getting serious.

509
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,970
It's fine.

510
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,290
Guardian, please.

511
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,250
I need help.

512
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,490
Guardian, please.

513
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,130
Alright, this is a little awkward.

514
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,510
I might have to use my special attack.

515
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,290
Alright, get over here.

516
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,430
It's been so long.

517
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,290
Look.

518
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,390
Look, it's been so long, guys.

519
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,450
It's been so long since I've been in war.

520
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,150
I need to brush it all up.

521
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,310
Alright, nice.

522
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,090
Come on.

523
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,390
Start dancing.

524
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,570
When do I start dancing?

525
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,190
Okay, I finished one guy.

526
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,770
Alright.

527
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,030
Alright, one of them's down.

528
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,590
Alright, now I dance.

529
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,850
I breakdance.

530
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,750
Let's go.

531
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,650
Breakdance in the battlefield.

532
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,190
Easy.

533
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,330
Oh wait, I'm full HP.

534
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:08,970
Nice.

535
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,050
There's more?

536
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:16,410
Please, I'm like fighting six of them.

537
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:16,830
Please.

538
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,230
John Fei, you can fight one.

539
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,690
I'm fighting six.

540
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,490
Can you not handle one guy, John Fei?

541
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,210
That's all I ask for.

542
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,710
Oh, I do not have enough allies.

543
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,770
I lost all my dragoons in the war against China.

544
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,510
Don't say that!

545
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,630
I killed five!

546
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,470
I literally just killed five!

547
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,630
Okay, nice.

548
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:46,870
Alright, nice.

549
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,350
We did it.

550
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,630
Alright.

551
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,430
Alright, nevermind.

552
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,530
There's still one more.

553
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,750
There's still one more.

554
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,450
Give me a sec.

555
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,510
Alright.

556
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,710
Jesus Christ.

557
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,290
Okay, I need to get him off his goddamn horse.

558
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,290
Oh, fuck!

559
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,170
Okay, nevermind.

560
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,610
Go do your arrows right here, dragoons.

561
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,510
In the middle of everybody.

562
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,190
Don't worry, you're gonna be so safe.

563
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,530
You'll be so safe.

564
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,650
Oh my god.

565
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:19,350
Please.

566
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,650
There's so many people around me.

567
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,250
Please.

568
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,370
Nice.

569
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:24,550
Nice.

570
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,370
Get out of here!

571
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,450
Okay, nice counter.

572
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,250
And then...

573
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,630
Boom!

574
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,670
John Fei, did you see that?

575
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,710
Why can't you do that?

576
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,310
I can't!

577
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,990
John Fei, why the heck can't you do that?

578
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,370
I don't understand!

579
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,490
Alright.

580
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,090
Easy.

581
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,010
It's that easy!

582
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,410
There we go.

583
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,470
Yeah, John Fei.

584
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,930
Let's begin our advance.

585
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,050
Alright, I need to grab this base first so I can grab some buns.

586
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,550
I have, like, not a lot of buns left.

587
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,230
Hello!

588
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,290
I'm here to get back my house.

589
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,390
Thanks for, like, holding it in for a little bit.

590
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,390
Alright.

591
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,150
What the fuck?

592
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,010
Why does it take so long?

593
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,910
Wait, there's someone here?

594
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,350
Oh wait, no, that's just Guan Yin.

595
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,270
Wait, I might be able to use my staff here.

596
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,010
Since it's just regular guys.

597
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,370
Alright.

598
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,990
Because it's just regular people, you get the staff treatment.

599
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,550
That's right.

600
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,170
You guys are so lucky.

601
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,330
I'm only using you for... to rizz up some generals.

602
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,410
Your purpose is to die so I can rizz up Zhao Yun.

603
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,690
That's your entire purpose.

604
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,230
Alright, where are the buns?

605
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,270
There's the buns.

606
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,970
Alright.

607
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,170
Alright, let's go.

608
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,870
Let's go.

609
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,050
They live... they live so I can rizz.

610
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,990
That's their purpose.

611
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,710
Alright, we gotta go downstairs here and then swap my equipment back.

612
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,050
I... oh my god.

613
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:28,590
Okay, let me... is there, like, an easier... I wish there was a favorite menu so I can just... I can just swap back, like, back and forth easily.

614
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,370
Get out of here, banner guys.

615
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,950
Get out of here.

616
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,350
You're not holding no banner.

617
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,750
Alright.

618
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,390
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat.

619
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,310
Thank you, thank you.

620
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,770
Can we get a happy birthday for Anthony since it's his birthday?

621
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,290
Of course!

622
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,510
Happy birthday to you.

623
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,150
Oh, I fucking... sorry, give me a sec.

624
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,650
I just ran past the people.

625
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,790
Of course.

626
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,030
Happy birthday to you.

627
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,470
Happy birthday to you.

628
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,990
Happy birthday, dear Anthony.

629
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,970
Happy birthday to you.

630
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,570
Yeah!

631
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,970
Happy birthday!

632
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,130
Okay, let me kill this guy real quick.

633
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,570
Where are all their children?

634
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,770
I literally came over here to kill the kids.

635
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,670
To end their bloodline.

636
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,450
Alright, let's go over here.

637
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,730
Let's get rid of this guy too.

638
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,210
How are you gonna lose?

639
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,090
Oh my god.

640
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,230
Okay, you gotta get out.

641
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,470
You gotta stop drinking, buddy.

642
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,870
Alright, I'm coming over.

643
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,630
The moment I kill this one old man.

644
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:38,690
Alright.

645
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,830
Don't worry, John Fae.

646
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,790
I'm coming over.

647
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,030
I'm coming over.

648
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,810
Oh buddy, we might need intervention.

649
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,410
You gotta stop drinking, man.

650
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,730
I swear to god, if you're struggling against a child...

651
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,290
Alright, you're so... okay, yeah, you are.

652
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:54,790
You're...

653
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,410
Alright, child.

654
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,130
I'm ready to fight you.

655
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,010
That's right.

656
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,330
Guys, you wanna watch me fight a child?

657
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,770
Get over here.

658
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,550
Oh my god.

659
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,090
Okay, you gotta go home.

660
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,450
You can't what?

661
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,890
You can't what?

662
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,330
You can't what?

663
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,530
Little girl!

664
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,310
That's right, go home!

665
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,870
It's bedtime.

666
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,130
Maybe you gotta go home, little girl.

667
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,910
I can't believe we just saw her beat up a child.

668
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,030
That's right, you wanna see me do it again?

669
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,370
Permanent bedtime.

670
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,090
Alright, let's get rid of him too.

671
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,930
No, I'm okay.

672
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,510
Don't worry.

673
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,130
Arrow time.

674
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,730
Alright, stand in front of all these swordsman dragoons.

675
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,530
You'll be fine.

676
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,330
Trust me.

677
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,050
Alright, he's almost dead.

678
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,950
I'm not gonna use my Yusou for this, man.

679
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,070
He's just one guy.

680
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,310
He doesn't even have like a unique model, but he's still part of the Sun family somehow.

681
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,650
Alright, nice.

682
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,230
And then...

683
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,250
My base now.

684
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,770
Alright, let me grab the top two just in case.

685
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,650
Alright, nice!

686
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,850
Okay, let's go this way.

687
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,210
Oh nice, I can be Guan Yu finally.

688
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,830
The real game starts soon.

689
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,650
Alright, let's kill this guy because apparently my team is struggling somehow against this one guy.

690
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,030
Alright.

691
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,330
Get out of here.

692
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,970
Get out of here.

693
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,090
You don't have a name.

694
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,490
Your name is literally someone else's name.

695
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,790
Alright, let's hope that Zhang Fei doesn't die.

696
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,330
Let's hope that the five seconds I left there and Zhang Fei will be okay.

697
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,450
Alright, Zhang Fei, I'm coming over.

698
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,490
You just killed a child.

699
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,570
Amazing work.

700
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,250
This is why you're the boss.

701
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,790
Alright.

702
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,510
You know what?

703
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,690
You know what time it is?

704
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,670
It's Guan Yu time.

705
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,810
Alright, so you're gonna protect your father's legacy?

706
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,110
That's funny.

707
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,190
Have you ever fought the god of war before?

708
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,190
Yeah?

709
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,630
You think your father's gonna be happy?

710
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,090
Don't worry.

711
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,010
I'm gonna humble you real quick.

712
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,850
Oh man, you're gonna use your special move?

713
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,330
That's right.

714
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,530
There we go.

715
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,710
Oh man.

716
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,210
That's so funny.

717
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,070
Oh, are you ever gonna choose one move?

718
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,610
Oh man.

719
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,050
What is he doing?

720
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,330
What is he doing?

721
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,070
Is he meditating?

722
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,750
What are you doing?

723
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,470
What is he doing?

724
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,550
What is he- Is he just meditating?

725
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,130
Alright.

726
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,710
Nice.

727
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,430
Alright, I'll finish the job.

728
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,470
Easy.

729
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,950
Bro, he was like meditating in the middle of the fight.

730
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,170
There's a time and place, man.

731
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,950
Wait, is this where Lu Bei is fighting?

732
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,950
Lu Bei, what the fuck are you doing here?

733
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,930
Lu Bei, get out of here!

734
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:54,650
You're the general!

735
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,710
You were not meant to do this!

736
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,110
Oh, okay.

737
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,030
A duel?

738
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,310
Oh, you saw how I beat up your sister?

739
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,590
I can do it again.

740
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,530
You want to see me do it again?

741
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,450
Same thing I did to her.

742
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:11,090
Oh man.

743
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,270
You tried, Sun Quan.

744
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,410
You really did try.

745
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,310
But I guess I'm gonna end your father's bloodline.

746
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,210
Oh, goodbye.

747
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,310
This was faster than the child.

748
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,910
Nice.

749
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,270
That was unfortunately faster than killing the child.

750
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,910
I think I know who has not been in war.

751
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,110
Alright, nice.

752
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,350
True warrior!

753
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,690
I am a true warrior now.

754
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,190
Alright, let's see.

755
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:46,990
Get him out of here.

756
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,490
Alright, nice.

757
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,610
I gotta get to him too.

758
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,250
You may as well.

759
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,750
They're just XP farm for me.

760
00:44:59,530 --> 00:44:59,790
Alright.

761
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,250
Oh, one more hit.

762
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:05,810
One more hit.

763
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,250
Yeah!

764
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,010
Oh shit.

765
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,650
Okay, not yeah.

766
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,350
Not yeah.

767
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,270
Not yeah.

768
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,610
Yeah!

769
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,930
My base.

770
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,310
True warrior.

771
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,870
True warrior by beating up a child.

772
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,250
Nice.

773
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,730
All I'm saying is that Sun Quan should really stop sending children to war.

774
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:32,830
Alright.

775
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:33,790
Is he dueling me?

776
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:34,930
Is he dueling me?

777
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,450
No?

778
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:36,630
Coward.

779
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,330
I'm gonna start breakdancing now.

780
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,230
You should have accepted my duel.

781
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,570
I feel like I should be allowed to challenge people to duels.

782
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,050
Like why?

783
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,430
How come they get to challenge me and I can't challenge them?

784
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,630
Alright, get out of here.

785
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,730
Oh man.

786
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,410
Sorry, Ji Ling.

787
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,450
Don't worry.

788
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,710
I'm almost done with them.

789
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,530
And then you can go home.

790
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:03,930
Go home!

791
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,130
Yay!

792
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:09,370
Goodbye.

793
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,890
Wait, is he even gonna fight back?

794
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,570
He literally hired a...

795
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,630
He literally hired a hydrogen bomb to fight these babies.

796
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,730
Like none of them have ever fought back before.

797
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:29,750
Don't worry.

798
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,870
I'm gonna beat you up in the corner.

799
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,890
Goodbye.

800
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:35,690
Yay!

801
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,130
Fight back, I say as I pummel him into the ground.

802
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,250
Why aren't you fighting back?

803
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,950
We did it!

804
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,750
Yay!

805
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,330
Alright.

806
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,330
Nice.

807
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,970
I hope she's getting stronger.

808
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,090
Alright, 15 skill point.

809
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,150
I won one duel.

810
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,250
Nice.

811
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,010
As if that was a challenge.

812
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,730
And then... Oh, nice.

813
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,330
I can...

814
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,890
Equip more accessories now.

815
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,220
Absol, thank you for the super chat.

816
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,020
Thank you, thank you.

817
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,940
When you ask someone to make a choice for you and they pick the option you secretly didn't want.

818
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,620
Thank you for the super chat.

819
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,620
Thank you, thank you.

820
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,200
Ah, yeah.

821
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,260
Sickness and not like poison or anything.

822
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,340
That was infamous during the Dynasty Warriors era.

823
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,760
You're all here.

824
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,480
Brother, what did you talk about with Lord Tao Ch'in?

825
00:47:59,220 --> 00:47:59,900
The future?

826
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:09,040
It appears that his lordship very much wants me to go to the Domainship of Shu.

827
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,800
You already refused the appointment.

828
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,540
Yes, I did.

829
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,460
I didn't believe I was up to the task.

830
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,960
And my opinion on that has not changed.

831
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,620
But...

832
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,580
How do you grow a beard?

833
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,700
When you start to own land, you grow a beard.

834
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,080
It's the way of the law.

835
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,840
It's like when you become a dad, you just start wearing socks with sandals.

836
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,940
You should accept, please.

837
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,260
I'm tired of being homeless.

838
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,300
I'm tired of you living in my apartment, please.

839
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,500
Get your own place.

840
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,200
Please, you need your own place.

841
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,740
I'm tired of you mooching off of my apartment.

842
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,640
Move out now.

843
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,480
It's fine if it's just you, but then you bring your two brothers.

844
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,780
We have one bed.

845
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,780
Yeah, doesn't he have sons?

846
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,040
Passed on and Lu Bei became the governor of Shu...

847
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,260
Like, what about his sons?

848
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,360
Like, what about Tao Qian's sons?

849
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:41,200
Imagine being like the son of the governor and then the guy was like, sorry.

850
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,400
This random dude that you don't know is gonna take over the province now.

851
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,000
Sorry, buddy.

852
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,460
They don't matter.

853
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,980
Alright, let's go to Inn.

854
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,500
Let's see if we have any new letters.

855
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,880
Oh, we have a lot.

856
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,860
Alright, what is upgraded now?

857
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Expands attack range, boosts damage dealt to enemies with parries.

858
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,820
Ooh, wait, that's really good.

859
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,260
Alright, do I have any fan mail?

860
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:21,340
Did you know that when your guard is supposedly down, you're as silent as a shadow?

861
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,380
I noticed this about you not long after we started living together.

862
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,500
When you go about your daily life, you make plenty of noise just like the rest of us.

863
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:36,540
But when you wake up, leave the terrible or return for the night, generally when you stop focusing on the world around you, your movements suddenly go silent.

864
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,620
Most people are just the opposite.

865
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,020
I wonder if you had some kind of training in the past that gave you this ability.

866
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,440
Ooh, I'm mysterious.

867
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,700
That's what makes him so drawn to me.

868
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,840
If that was the case, it must have been a long and thorough process for it to be innate to the point of it practically being a bodily function.

869
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,220
The kinds of people who do that sort of training are... no.

870
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,920
You must not let your imagination wander too far.

871
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,640
What I do know for certain is that you actually make noise on purpose to avoid startling me when you draw near.

872
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,120
Although you do leave the room quite messy from time to time.

873
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,620
The little acts of courtesy like that are what makes you unique.

874
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,220
Oh, what?

875
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,660
Oh, I'm sorry for being a terrible roommate.

876
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,720
At least I pay rent.

877
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,590
What have you done?

878
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,690
Since you're living for free here, you might as well, you know, help me clean.

879
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:32,690
You know?

880
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,190
Not be a fucking freeloader.

881
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,620
Alright, let's see.

882
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,160
Oh, hey, JonFay wants to talk.

883
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,300
What did I talk about?

884
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,450
Doki, he's your live-in doctor, not your live-in maid.

885
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,550
Look, he's barely being a doctor right now.

886
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,330
I'm just saying.

887
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,730
I feel like we should split up the chores that matches the contribution to the household.

888
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,530
He's going to want to give him a hand.

889
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:26,770
Even though men like Louie Boo are nothing but trouble.

890
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,010
Why don't you stop?

891
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,050
Why not just help him?

892
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,870
Yeah, why not just help him?

893
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,690
I'm not totally against the idea.

894
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:41,510
After all, our brother never fails to provide aid to those who ask.

895
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,870
All I'm saying is that...

896
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,050
But it's Louie Boo we're talking about here.

897
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,690
I mean, he treats me alright.

898
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,930
He invited me to dinner, guys.

899
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,130
A private dinner with me and Louie Boo.

900
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,770
I think he seems like an alright man.

901
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,430
Even though he did murder thousands of men.

902
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,670
He seems like an alright guy because he treated me to dinner.

903
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:21,890
Alright.

904
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:22,370
Nice.

905
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,910
Okay, rescue of Louie Boo.

906
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,450
Okay, we gotta rescue Louie Boo.

907
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,530
Okay, before we do that, we gotta search for the moon grass.

908
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,490
Where the fuck is the moon grass?

909
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,750
Always show map.

910
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,130
Okay.

911
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,070
Oh, it's in Jin province.

912
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,430
Alright, let's go to Jin province real quick.

913
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,110
And find this...

914
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,810
This grass for my fucking drug.

915
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,510
Uh...

916
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,570
Lian province, Jin province.

917
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,090
Alright, it should be here.

918
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,530
Okay,

919
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:00,950
it's not here.

920
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,310
How the fuck?

921
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,430
Where is this?

922
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,010
Am I still in Jin?

923
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:12,390
Where am I anymore?

924
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:14,270
No, I'm still in Jin.

925
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:14,570
Okay.

926
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,430
Where is this?

927
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:20,690
Where is it?

928
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:21,750
Is it back here?

929
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,230
Okay, they locked it.

930
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:27,390
Uh...

931
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,770
Am I in Jin yet still?

932
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,050
I'm still in Jin, right?

933
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:30,690
Yeah, I am.

934
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:31,710
Alright.

935
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,970
Jesus Christ, I'm so...

936
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:39,350
Okay, no.

937
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,190
That's not Jin.

938
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,090
Okay, this here is Jin.

939
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,370
Alright.

940
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,030
Alright.

941
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,430
Am I still there?

942
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,750
Alright, I'm like at the edge of Jin.

943
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,770
So like, the doors have yet to open.

944
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,330
Unless it's over here.

945
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,590
Alright, this is still Jin.

946
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:58,990
Freedom!

947
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,430
Where the fuck is this stupid moongrass?

948
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,910
Is this moongrass?

949
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,170
No, that's just a coin.

950
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,570
Alright, so...

951
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,650
No incense for me.

952
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,970
God damn it.

953
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,770
No incense for me.

954
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,910
I cannot find this moongrass.

955
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,690
Oh, it's located... Oh yeah, you're right.

956
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,830
It's located in the moon.

957
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,390
I'm still there.

958
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,970
I'm still in Jin province.

959
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,110
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

960
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,790
I think I found it.

961
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:36,530
Is this moongrass?

962
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:37,890
Oh, there it is.

963
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,150
I found moongrass.

964
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,110
Okay, nice.

965
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:40,990
Alright.

966
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,430
Alright, my child doctor.

967
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,670
Drug me up.

968
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,650
Make me see those funky visions.

969
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,070
Okay, not here.

970
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,370
Sorry, I forgot.

971
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,010
I had to go home for that.

972
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,430
Alright.

973
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,610
Alright, my child doctor.

974
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,690
I had to go all the way back here.

975
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:05,470
Or was it here?

976
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,430
I don't remember.

977
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,150
What funky visions?

978
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,870
Don't worry.

979
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,990
Don't worry about it.

980
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:14,290
Don't worry about it.

981
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,070
My doctor prescribed it to me, so it's safe.

982
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,690
What?

983
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:21,930
Oh, there he is.

984
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,170
He might be like underage, but I trust him.

985
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,830
Oh, that herb?

986
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,690
You've done well to bring me such a specimen.

987
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,950
That's something else.

988
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,290
Seems you have a keen eye for plants.

989
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:36,930
Impressive.

990
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:40,570
I need to make an incense out of this right away.

991
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,270
Let's head over to the village.

992
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,930
Being there might help you remember.

993
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,270
Alright, here we go.

994
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,570
It's time to light it up.

995
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,330
With my child doctor.

996
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,070
Is your doctor qualified?

997
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,730
All the other doctors are dead.

998
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,190
So all I have is a child.

999
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,730
That's what trauma does to you.

1000
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,750
Oh, we're sheltered!

1001
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,870
Oh my god, that's the easiest type of village to take over.

1002
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,610
When they don't know the outside world.

1003
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:05,170
That means they're not exposed to like the outside bacteria yet.

1004
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,930
We can give them the plague.

1005
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,290
We can give them chickenpox.

1006
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,810
I can't help hoping that they won't grow up like us.

1007
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,030
Is that arrogant of me?

1008
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,430
Do you think?

1009
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,170
I want us to be the end of it.

1010
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:40,630
The last guardians of peace.

1011
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,190
I dream of a day when the realm doesn't...

1012
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,630
I hope they can accomplish what they're trying to do.

1013
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,050
You know, bring peace to the world back then.

1014
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,970
I wonder if it worked and we never had wars after that.

1015
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,830
Or like any type of world war.

1016
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,510
Cause they're the last guardians of peace.

1017
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,350
Guys, do you think they did it?

1018
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,230
Do you think it worked?

1019
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,310
They finally got rid of all wars.

1020
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,930
War went extinct forever.

1021
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:19,490
Alright, let's see.

1022
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,830
Let me check real quick.

1023
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,390
Did they accomplish their goal?

1024
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,110
Well,

1025
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:47,270
he was a brutal dictator or a feudal China when I was dating him.

1026
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:47,810
Exactly.

1027
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,630
He was nice to me though.

1028
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,330
Alright.

1029
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,270
Do I have any... Oh, I don't?

1030
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:56,290
Oh, it's cause of the other...

1031
00:59:56,290 --> 01:00:00,630
Oh, I lost the interaction with the other guy because I was like...

1032
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,790
I was like, shoo forever baby.

1033
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,790
I don't understand those types of friends.

1034
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,450
I know like...

1035
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,350
You know how there's people who are like...

1036
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:17,330
Obviously they're friends with people who are pieces of shit.

1037
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:22,070
But then they'll be like Yeah, but he wasn't a piece of shit to me though.

1038
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,930
And they'll still hang out with him.

1039
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:32,410
As long as he wasn't an asshole to me, it's okay.

1040
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,010
He commits a couple of war crimes.

1041
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:38,430
Real.

1042
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:40,710
Too real.

1043
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,090
Too real.

1044
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,210
No, but you don't get it though.

1045
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,330
Doki, you don't get it.

1046
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,570
Let's see, where's my spear?

1047
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:00,610
Alright, there you go.

1048
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:06,230
Support the homies no matter what type of war crimes they do.

1049
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,530
Is that it?

1050
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,390
Alright, let's get him out of here.

1051
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,410
Alright.

1052
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,130
Alright.

1053
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:20,550
Alright, nice.

1054
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:21,370
Goodbye!

1055
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,650
He's sitting too close to home.

1056
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,850
Are you supporting a war criminal, Orange?

1057
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,570
What do you mean?

1058
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,950
He's sitting too close to home.

1059
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,130
Okay.

1060
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,030
Oh wait, this guy is strong.

1061
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:44,870
So is I.

1062
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:48,890
That's bad.

1063
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:52,670
Alright.

1064
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,310
Alright, nice.

1065
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,370
Let me get rid of him real quick.

1066
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:04,450
Pros before international law.

1067
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:12,590
Alright, but my war crimes are in-game.

1068
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:16,130
It's okay.

1069
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:22,050
I'm making sure I'm getting rid of my urges in-game so it never becomes reality.

1070
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,770
So that's different, guys.

1071
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:30,810
Criminals just need to let out their steam in virtual reality and then everything will be fine.

1072
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:36,310
When we put all the criminals in virtual reality, the world will be a more peaceful place.

1073
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,510
Oh my god, it's so perfect.

1074
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,730
Do not allow the peasants to be defeated.

1075
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:48,110
I'm trying my best!

1076
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,390
Alright, let's go.

1077
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:51,890
Yay, I did it.

1078
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,270
I saved the peasants.

1079
01:02:54,670 --> 01:03:09,330
So Australia, why don't we just like deport all the criminals to like a random secluded island and then... Like all I'm saying is we did that once before and Australia came out just fine.

1080
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:17,650
All I'm saying is like, they are maybe a little like, you know, a little rowdy but Australia came out fine.

1081
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,790
We can make Australia 2.0!

1082
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:27,230
Oh my god, I have to head all the way over there.

1083
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,630
Oh, it's because they have two people beating him up.

1084
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,150
Whoops, I should have chose the other side first.

1085
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,270
I'm trying my best.

1086
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,630
My horse is not that fast, man.

1087
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,150
Is he okay?

1088
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,050
Please, eat some bread.

1089
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:39,670
Eat some bread.

1090
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:40,290
Eat some bread.

1091
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:41,790
Please, there's a lot.

1092
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:45,470
Please, I'm getting fucking body blocked by 200 people.

1093
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:47,850
Like...

1094
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:48,790
Alright.

1095
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:51,430
Honestly?

1096
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:52,690
No, no.

1097
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:53,170
New Zealand?

1098
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:54,310
No, no, no.

1099
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:58,310
I don't trust New Zealand.

1100
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,410
I can't remember like how...

1101
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,310
Okay, when COVID was a thing?

1102
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,870
Okay, it still is.

1103
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:09,850
It was.

1104
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:11,870
Sorry.

1105
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:24,530
When COVID was a worse thing and then like somehow New Zealand was like one of the only countries that had like barely any cases of COVID.

1106
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,890
Cases of COVID?

1107
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,330
What did they do?

1108
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,590
It's all a conspiracy.

1109
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:36,250
It's all like a fee thing with New Zealand.

1110
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:42,150
But it's actually crazy that like New Zealand was able to do what no other country could.

1111
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,310
Dude, have you been to New Zealand?

1112
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,170
That New Zealand conspiracy.

1113
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,530
They also really like sheep.

1114
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,030
Be a remote...

1115
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,490
Yeah, but Australia is a remote island.

1116
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,490
They have more sheep than people.

1117
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,590
Dude, they're an island.

1118
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,670
I'm just joking guys.

1119
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,370
I do think it's very impressive that they were able to like fix COVID.

1120
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:21,330
When like the rest of the world was like in shambles.

1121
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,950
They were actually able to be like we're okay.

1122
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:25,890
Yeah.

1123
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:37,580
That's why all I'm saying is that New Zealand New Zealand has some space.

1124
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,900
I mean, Australia came out okay.

1125
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,780
Australia came out okay when we, you know, put all our criminals there.

1126
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,300
We could do it again.

1127
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,660
New Zealand, the home of Lord of the Rings.

1128
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,780
The home of the shy.

1129
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,760
Alright, let's see.

1130
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,120
Thank you for the super chat.

1131
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,160
Thank you, thank you.

1132
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,360
Okay, I know she commits war crimes but you haven't heard her crow.

1133
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,420
We have guards now?

1134
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:21,500
The guards will continue to defend the spot until they receive an order to return.

1135
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:33,760
What if I just send the guards all the way Imagine if I just send the guard to like end game.

1136
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,880
Just try to kill the leader.

1137
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,500
You're all two of you by yourself.

1138
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,980
You'll be fine, don't worry.

1139
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,600
Wait, I shouldn't even mean...

1140
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,960
What are my gems?

1141
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,400
Attack range...

1142
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,980
Yeah, we'll do the attack range.

1143
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,000
Okay,

1144
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,980
let's get this one real quick.

1145
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,480
What is this, level 30?

1146
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,440
I'm level 31.

1147
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,160
Let's get two more guards in here.

1148
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,660
Rest in peace, those two dragons.

1149
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,260
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

1150
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,400
Thank you, thank you.

1151
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,220
Last I heard, there was this war to end all wars.

1152
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,280
I wonder how that went.

1153
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,040
Yeah, that was the last one too, right?

1154
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:28,500
Right?

1155
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,520
That was the last one.

1156
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,000
Boom.

1157
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,020
Boom, get out of here.

1158
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,440
Boom, get out of here.

1159
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,180
Alright, nice.

1160
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,600
Alright, that was easy.

1161
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,200
Pretty sure.

1162
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,020
Yeah, so the guard, they did it!

1163
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,280
The guardians of peace did it!

1164
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,020
Yay!

1165
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:01,860
Okay.

1166
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,520
Just fuck that one guy in particular.

1167
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,180
Alright.

1168
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,420
Alright, let's see here.

1169
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:13,940
Boop.

1170
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,100
Boop.

1171
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,520
Get out of here.

1172
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,680
Alright.

1173
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:22,940
Come on.

1174
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,160
Why do you have so much HP?!

1175
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,620
All you're gonna do is die anyway!

1176
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,100
That's right!

1177
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,180
Get in the corner!

1178
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,320
Get in the naughty corner!

1179
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,640
It's your time out, buddy!

1180
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:38,860
Okay.

1181
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,880
You're just XP for my Riz!

1182
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,600
You don't matter!

1183
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,920
I'm literally using you to level up my Riz!

1184
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,920
Get cornered!

1185
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,220
Damn!

1186
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,300
That's fucking right!

1187
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,820
That's your entire purpose!

1188
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:01,740
Alright.

1189
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,260
Nice.

1190
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,360
Alright, let's see how much more I need.

1191
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,540
God, the perfect evade is gonna be fucking a struggle.

1192
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,680
Uh, 123...

1193
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,820
Okay, that's fine.

1194
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,020
Okay, let me...

1195
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,900
Oh, wait, fuck.

1196
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,560
Okay.

1197
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,560
I forgot how to dodge, so this is gonna be interesting.

1198
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,580
I always forget to dodge.

1199
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:33,760
Boom!

1200
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,000
Nice.

1201
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,720
Oh my god, they're just gone.

1202
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,460
Alright, one more.

1203
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,600
Two more, actually.

1204
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:46,000
Oh my god, this one guy is very confident.

1205
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,540
Woo!

1206
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:49,400
Alright.

1207
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:53,760
C'mon.

1208
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,700
Get outta here.

1209
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,080
Get outta here!

1210
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,360
Get your ass outta here!

1211
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,580
This is your only purpose!

1212
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:06,300
I'm literally only doing this mission so I can finish my Dao Yun Riz.

1213
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,240
Nice.

1214
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,120
Get outta here!

1215
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,600
That's fucking right!

1216
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,040
Life doesn't matter!

1217
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,920
Your entire purpose is so I can Riz feudal Chinese generals!

1218
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:22,800
Hahaha!

1219
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,560
Alright.

1220
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,340
Get out.

1221
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,160
Hello, this is a 1v1.

1222
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:29,720
Leave.

1223
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:31,140
Hahaha!

1224
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:33,920
Alright.

1225
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:34,700
Nice.

1226
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,960
We have 7 out of 13 guards.

1227
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,140
What happened to my other guards?

1228
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,520
How did you guys die?

1229
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,120
Okay.

1230
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,120
And then...

1231
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,680
Boop.

1232
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:49,580
Boop.

1233
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:50,620
Boop.

1234
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:52,840
Boop.

1235
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,000
Thank you so much for the raid!

1236
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,100
Thank you!

1237
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,740
Sorry, I'm just beating up this one guy in the corner.

1238
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,660
Like, it's not even a challenge.

1239
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,900
It's literally like my to-do list for the day.

1240
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,140
It's a chore, unfortunately.

1241
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,180
That's how little his life matters.

1242
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,140
Hahaha!

1243
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,240
Boop!

1244
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,520
Nice!

1245
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:18,800
Fight back!

1246
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,160
It's like...

1247
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,840
It's like my morning routine.

1248
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,520
8am, I kill this general.

1249
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,820
8.02, I kill this other general.

1250
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:29,600
8.03.

1251
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,260
Hahaha!

1252
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,740
Alright, nice.

1253
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,600
Plus 6.

1254
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:35,940
I did that.

1255
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,970
Alright, now to...

1256
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,970
Strengthen allied troops.

1257
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:50,870
What, my own?

1258
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,910
Oh, I can learn a new tactic.

1259
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,350
Okay, how do I...

1260
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,630
equip it, though?

1261
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,250
Oh wait, I have another accessory!

1262
01:11:59,410 --> 01:11:59,590
Okay.

1263
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:00,450
Wait, what am I using?

1264
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:04,810
Okay, 5% health when an officer is defeated.

1265
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,310
Okay.

1266
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,050
Boost health by 20%?

1267
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,490
I feel like I always need health.

1268
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:13,970
Increases damage taken...

1269
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,370
Uh, defense...

1270
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,250
Restore health...

1271
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,970
Boost attack...

1272
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:21,930
Boost, wait...

1273
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,970
For each allied base you have...

1274
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:26,470
When you stop...

1275
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,810
Restore is 10%.

1276
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,830
Reduce attack...

1277
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:31,330
I feel like I always need health, though.

1278
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,290
Boost defense strength.

1279
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,770
Boost attack strength.

1280
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:35,990
Okay, I'm gonna get the health.

1281
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,630
Uh... Alright, squad.

1282
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,410
Oh, there we go.

1283
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,550
Encouragement, charge...

1284
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:44,750
Order...

1285
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,830
The guards will continue to defend this spot until they receive an order.

1286
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:48,570
Okay, we'll do...

1287
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,950
How much encouragement do I get?

1288
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,810
And then, charge.

1289
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:56,290
We'll do charge and... charge and encouragement.

1290
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,870
Oh!

1291
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,670
I got an offering!

1292
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:02,250
Also got yoink.

1293
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:06,030
Sash, boost attack speed.

1294
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:06,650
Oh, nice.

1295
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:08,510
Thank you for the free offering, guys.

1296
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:12,010
Abso!

1297
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1298
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,090
Thank you, thank you.

1299
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:16,010
They were too afraid...

1300
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:18,850
Of spreading it to their beloved sheep, so they...

1301
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:21,530
So they were being extra cautious.

1302
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:23,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1303
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:24,810
Thank you, thank you.

1304
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,770
Not the sheep.

1305
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,230
Was pursued by Cao Cao and Yuan Shao.

1306
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:31,330
Yuan Shao is still involved?

1307
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:31,770
Bro!

1308
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,210
After you have the yellow turbans, you don't matter.

1309
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,710
Your existence is like...

1310
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:38,490
Obsolete.

1311
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,450
That's why you're yellow.

1312
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:45,690
That was your only purpose in this story.

1313
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:49,200
Alright.

1314
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,300
We have received a call for aid from Lord Lu Bu and I plan to answer it.

1315
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,000
Lord Lu Bu and his men are on the run.

1316
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,400
Pursued by Yuan Shao.

1317
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,980
We need to protect them until they can reach somewhere safe.

1318
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:06,900
Defeating Yuan Shao will end the chase, but having to cut through his massive forces to get him to make it nigh is impossible.

1319
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:07,960
You know what?

1320
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:09,140
I can do it.

1321
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:09,800
Oh my god, wait.

1322
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,120
I'm gonna do it.

1323
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:19,800
I'm gonna take my horse and go straight in there.

1324
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,940
Hardest so when both I and Lord Lu Bu must survive, Lu Bu will be fine.

1325
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:33,440
We will rendezvous with Lu Bu and then fend off the enemy while making our retreat.

1326
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:35,080
I can do it, guys!

1327
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,520
Lu Bu does not need rescuing.

1328
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,760
I'm gonna take my horse and go straight in.

1329
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,440
What's the worst that could happen?

1330
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:53,220
Guys, what possibly could be the worst thing that could happen to me?

1331
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,540
It might be the worst thing that could happen to Lu Bei or Lu Bu, but not me.

1332
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,500
Absolutely.

1333
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1334
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,480
Thank you, thank you.

1335
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:06,060
That time I died and reincarnated in ancient China and rinsed up all the war heroes.

1336
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,760
The new hit Isekai anime in 2025.

1337
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,680
I know that y'all have mixed feelings about him, but he has made himself no shortage of enemies.

1338
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:19,120
But when he asked for my help, I felt compelled to give it.

1339
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,660
Yeah, I thought that might be the case.

1340
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,940
Well, if that's your decision, brother, we are with you all the way.

1341
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,420
We will go where you lead us, brother.

1342
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,260
Gator, thank you for the super chat.

1343
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,360
Thank you, thank you.

1344
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,240
Gonna take her horse down the old...

1345
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,880
Gonna take my horse down the old Silk Road.

1346
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,860
So, I've never liked that Lu Bu.

1347
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,020
I'd rather take his life than save it.

1348
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,180
Nonetheless, thank you both.

1349
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,960
Not Doki, will you come with us too?

1350
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,580
Yes, but I'll fight my way.

1351
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,260
Exactly.

1352
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,200
I will fight through this.

1353
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,080
This concludes the War Council.

1354
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,100
Let's head out when everyone is ready.

1355
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,000
Stop giving me John Fei.

1356
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,380
You're not gonna make me take John Fei over Guan Yu.

1357
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,620
Alright, let's go.

1358
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:08,960
Alright, guys.

1359
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,440
I'm gonna do it.

1360
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,340
I'm going straight in.

1361
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,540
I'm going straight in.

1362
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,180
Lu Bu, you'll live, right?

1363
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,380
Bro, it's not even that far.

1364
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,300
It'll be fine.

1365
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,860
It's such a short journey.

1366
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:33,660
It'll be fine.

1367
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,480
I should change my equipment though.

1368
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,280
If I'm gonna do this.

1369
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,920
Alright, don't worry.

1370
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:40,780
I'm almost there.

1371
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,680
I'm coming in.

1372
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,940
Don't worry.

1373
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,720
Oh, shit.

1374
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:49,780
Oh, shit.

1375
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,180
Okay.

1376
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,640
I swear to god.

1377
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,180
It will work, guys.

1378
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,360
Guys, I'm almost there.

1379
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,740
I'm almost there.

1380
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,540
Don't worry.

1381
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,780
I'm gonna make it.

1382
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:04,620
I'm gonna...

1383
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:06,880
Don't worry.

1384
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,140
Don't worry.

1385
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,320
It's gonna work, guys.

1386
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:09,840
Don't worry.

1387
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,280
I might be like...

1388
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,340
Okay.

1389
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:13,940
Guys, I think...

1390
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,800
I think, guys...

1391
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,060
Don't worry.

1392
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,400
It'll be fine.

1393
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,520
It'll be so fine.

1394
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,420
I feel so healthy right now.

1395
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,980
I feel incredibly healthy right now.

1396
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,260
It's fine.

1397
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,260
It's fine, guys.

1398
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,500
It's...

1399
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:38,600
Okay.

1400
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,340
Guys, I feel so healthy.

1401
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,620
I have no more buns.

1402
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,600
I have no more buns.

1403
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,560
It's fine.

1404
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:50,100
It's okay.

1405
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,200
I may or may not have no more buns, but it's okay.

1406
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,620
I can do this.

1407
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,020
Oh my god.

1408
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,280
Oh my god.

1409
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,500
Oh shit.

1410
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:06,220
Okay.

1411
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,000
Don't worry.

1412
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:07,480
I'm safe.

1413
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:07,980
I'm okay.

1414
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,500
I'm okay.

1415
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,420
I'm okay.

1416
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,560
I feel so...

1417
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:10,980
I'm okay.

1418
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:11,500
I'm okay.

1419
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:12,480
I'm okay.

1420
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,400
I'm okay, guys.

1421
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
I'm okay.

1422
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,440
It's okay.

1423
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,300
I have this.

1424
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,560
I look very safe.

1425
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,820
It's okay.

1426
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,420
I feel so safe, guys.

1427
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,160
I feel incredibly safe.

1428
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,760
It's okay.

1429
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,020
See?

1430
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:36,580
Look at that.

1431
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:38,820
See?

1432
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,760
We're so healthy.

1433
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,100
Oh, look at that.

1434
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,920
Wait.

1435
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,040
What do you mean?

1436
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,320
See?

1437
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:48,760
Look at that.

1438
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,120
We're so healthy.

1439
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,060
I told you.

1440
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,580
I told you, guys.

1441
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,700
No, no, no.

1442
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,280
We're fine.

1443
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,420
We're so fine.

1444
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,600
I told you.

1445
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:06,900
See?

1446
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:07,600
Look at that.

1447
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,120
We're fine.

1448
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:11,600
We're fine.

1449
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,500
We got extra buns, too.

1450
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,460
Okay, but where is he?

1451
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,180
Oh, he's over there.

1452
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:18,620
Okay.

1453
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,040
I told you.

1454
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,500
Wait, what?

1455
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,620
Wait, why are they mobilizing?

1456
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,460
It's literally just me.

1457
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,200
Why are they mobilizing?

1458
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,940
It's literally just me.

1459
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,480
Please.

1460
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,060
Why are you mobilizing?

1461
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,900
It's literally just me.

1462
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,720
Like, stop.

1463
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:48,780
Stop.

1464
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:51,960
Okay.

1465
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,800
Guys, give me a sec.

1466
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,940
I'm almost there.

1467
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,780
Where is he?

1468
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,600
Give me a sec.

1469
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,760
Oh, my God.

1470
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,400
Challenge me, please.

1471
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,540
Challenge me to a duel.

1472
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,260
Challenge me to a duel.

1473
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,280
Please.

1474
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,620
If you challenge me to a duel, this can all be over.

1475
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,480
Just let me challenge you to a duel, please.

1476
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,360
Please, I...

1477
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:24,660
Please.

1478
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,760
If you challenge me to a duel, this can be over.

1479
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,060
Okay.

1480
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,140
Alright, guys, this might be...

1481
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,340
Guys, I don't think...

1482
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,380
Guys, I only have one more button, guys.

1483
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,480
Guys, I...

1484
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,000
Guys, I'm not okay right now.

1485
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,760
I'm not okay.

1486
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,440
Just 1v1 me, bro.

1487
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,760
Just 1v1 me.

1488
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,920
That's all I ask for.

1489
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,180
It's just this.

1490
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:55,340
Come on.

1491
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,760
1v1 me, bro.

1492
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,340
1v1 me.

1493
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:02,760
1v1 me.

1494
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,000
Come on.

1495
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:07,920
Just 1v1 me, bro.

1496
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,220
Guys, I don't have any more buttons.

1497
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,200
I don't have any more buttons, guys.

1498
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,740
This is a little bad.

1499
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,200
I don't...

1500
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,420
Are you serious?

1501
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,940
How do we have more?

1502
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,640
Okay.

1503
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,280
Okay.

1504
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,300
Okay, we gotta kill him.

1505
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,220
No!

1506
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,380
Okay.

1507
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:46,700
Guys, all I'm saying was that it was an incredibly good effort.

1508
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,400
I literally...

1509
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:55,260
Everyone might have been dead, but like, I killed more...

1510
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,500
I killed two-thirds of his army.

1511
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:06,580
I did kill two-thirds of his army by myself.

1512
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,560
I literally soloed his army, guys.

1513
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,420
Like, I died, but like, it was a good effort.

1514
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,480
It was a good try.

1515
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,920
I just had like...

1516
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:28,520
All I'm saying is that if I had just a little bit more buttons, we could have made it work.

1517
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,480
It would have been possible.

1518
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,180
It was just...

1519
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,040
It was just a shortage of buttons.

1520
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:45,280
I surprisingly lived a lot longer than I expected.

1521
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,540
Look, that is why I'm not a strategist here.

1522
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,200
I thought I could take him!

1523
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,260
I thought I could take him!

1524
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,660
It's fine.

1525
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,000
Look at that.

1526
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,400
There we go.

1527
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:17,300
Now, I trained so much for this that like, this is nothing to me.

1528
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:21,940
If only it was just him.

1529
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:25,080
Alright, don't worry.

1530
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,100
I got you, guys.

1531
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,080
It's time to eat your buns.

1532
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,200
Okay.

1533
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:33,980
Look at that.

1534
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,880
It's like...

1535
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,960
I'm so...

1536
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,180
After defeating an entire fucking army, this is like nothing to me.

1537
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,860
Like, who would have thought?

1538
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,420
Alright.

1539
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:51,120
Nice.

1540
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,900
Encourage my allies!

1541
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,120
Let's go!

1542
01:23:58,860 --> 01:23:59,900
Alright, nice.

1543
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:08,560
There's so many things happening, but I killed them so fast that they can't even talk.

1544
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,160
Alright, nice.

1545
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,340
That's me!

1546
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,120
That's me!

1547
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:17,160
Wait, where is he?

1548
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,320
Oh, there he is!

1549
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,100
Don't worry, Lu Bu.

1550
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,220
Also, where the fuck was Lu Bu during my entire 1v1 entire army?

1551
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,400
There we go.

1552
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:29,740
I did it.

1553
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:34,320
Alright.

1554
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,000
Lay me on the buns.

1555
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:43,060
All I'm saying is that if I had enough buns, everything would have been fine.

1556
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,420
Thank you for the super chat!

1557
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:48,840
Thank you!

1558
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,340
Thank you for the super chat!

1559
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:51,720
Thank you!

1560
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:52,880
You're brave.

1561
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,940
I'll give you that.

1562
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,120
I could have done it.

1563
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,240
I could have taken him.

1564
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,680
If I had one more bun, I could have done it.

1565
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,120
That coward!

1566
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,120
It's just because that coward wouldn't 1v1 me.

1567
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,580
If your chat 1v1 me, it would have been over.

1568
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:14,980
Nice.

1569
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:15,700
Goodbye.

1570
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,920
No dancing for you.

1571
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,340
Oh, nice.

1572
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,340
What did I get?

1573
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:28,380
A crescent blade charged strong attack can be powered up by relentlessly chain- Oh, wait!

1574
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,580
Is that Guan Yu's blade?

1575
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,400
Wait, I got his blade!

1576
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:32,320
Nice.

1577
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:34,660
Alright.

1578
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,440
Got his blade.

1579
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,620
Now I can be the god of war.

1580
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,400
Get out of here.

1581
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,960
Alright, guys.

1582
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:48,960
I can take him.

1583
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,820
Guys, I think now...

1584
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,140
Guys, I think I can...

1585
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,340
I think I can...

1586
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:05,700
Now that I got Guan Yu's blade, I think I can take him.

1587
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,460
Second time...

1588
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,880
Second time's the charm, okay?

1589
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,860
Oh, I'm saved.

1590
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,720
No, no, no, no.

1591
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:22,940
Guys, guys, guys.

1592
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,540
This time...

1593
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,760
I can do it.

1594
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:27,080
This time.

1595
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:28,420
I can do it.

1596
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:28,880
I swear.

1597
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,740
I can...

1598
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,320
Alright, let's get him out of here.

1599
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:38,380
Fine.

1600
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,360
Fine.

1601
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:45,000
I guess like, if we wanna be little bitches, I guess I won't.

1602
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,640
But I think I can kill Cao Cao.

1603
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:48,860
You know what?

1604
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,640
I can kill Cao Cao.

1605
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,020
I trust you.

1606
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:53,760
I believe.

1607
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,200
I believe.

1608
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,840
Guys, I can do it.

1609
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,920
I just need more buns.

1610
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,660
But like, I think I can take Cao Cao.

1611
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,280
Alright, I'm going in.

1612
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:07,940
Get out of here.

1613
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,380
I'm going straight in.

1614
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,280
I'm going.

1615
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,000
I can do it.

1616
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,840
I can do it.

1617
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,920
Don't worry.

1618
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,320
I'm here.

1619
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:25,500
Don't worry.

1620
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,800
I think...

1621
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,220
I think I can do it.

1622
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,540
Round 2.

1623
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,380
You'll never learn.

1624
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,660
No, this is different.

1625
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,200
This is different.

1626
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,480
This is so different, guys.

1627
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,680
This is Cao Cao.

1628
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,600
This is so different.

1629
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:46,640
This is so different.

1630
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,800
Where's my HP?

1631
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,780
Where did my HP go?

1632
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,880
Where is my HP?

1633
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,600
I can still do it.

1634
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,340
I can still do it, guys.

1635
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,480
I don't know what happened to my HP.

1636
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,380
But it's okay.

1637
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,000
It's okay.

1638
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:16,980
It's fine.

1639
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,140
HP disappeared.

1640
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,760
Can't shatter my confidence if I'm too dumb to realize it.

1641
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:31,480
There we go.

1642
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,120
That's all I'm saying.

1643
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:37,460
You can't shatter shit if I don't know what's going on.

1644
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,360
There we go.

1645
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,420
I told you guys.

1646
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,220
Wait.

1647
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,360
I told you guys.

1648
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,020
Wait.

1649
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,060
Wait a minute.

1650
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,520
I told you.

1651
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,280
I told you I can take him.

1652
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,000
I told you.

1653
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:05,660
I fucking told you.

1654
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:09,500
I told you I can do it.

1655
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,820
I can take him down.

1656
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,660
No one believe me.

1657
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,160
No.

1658
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,380
I can't believe it.

1659
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,420
Look at that.

1660
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,900
I told you.

1661
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,620
I told you.

1662
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,420
I told you.

1663
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:38,420
Wait.

1664
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,480
How did he retake that base?

1665
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,400
I can't believe no one buddy believed that.

1666
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,200
There you go.

1667
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,800
I told you.

1668
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,040
You know what?

1669
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,480
I feel so confident now.

1670
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,580
I feel so fucking confident now.

1671
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,860
I'm going for it.

1672
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:10,900
You know what?

1673
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,000
I can take him.

1674
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,360
He's overconfident.

1675
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,720
You know what?

1676
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,580
I can take him.

1677
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:21,780
Get over here.

1678
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:26,340
I told you I just needed more buns.

1679
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,560
Alright, get over here.

1680
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,600
Where is he?

1681
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,340
Where is he?

1682
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,760
I don't even see my arrows.

1683
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,200
I feel so confident.

1684
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:48,460
I don't know where he is but I feel so confident.

1685
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,100
Where the fuck is he?

1686
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,420
Alright, there's like so many names in front of me so I need to find him.

1687
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,880
Okay.

1688
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,840
Alright.

1689
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:08,340
I don't know where he is guys.

1690
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:10,140
Like, that's the issue.

1691
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,360
I literally can't see anything.

1692
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,460
Alright.

1693
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:20,860
There we go.

1694
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,620
True warrior time.

1695
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:24,700
Where's Yuan Shao?

1696
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,560
Where is he?

1697
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,340
I don't see Yuan Shao anywhere in here.

1698
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,380
There's so many names.

1699
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,960
Where is Yuan Shao's name?

1700
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,060
Which one is it?

1701
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:42,360
I see just too many names.

1702
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,660
Where is he?

1703
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,580
No!

1704
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:52,960
No!

1705
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:02,080
He walked Bro, he just walked past me.

1706
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:02,960
No!

1707
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,040
My kill!

1708
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,420
Bro, he just walked away?

1709
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,380
I can't believe it!

1710
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,860
We could've taken him!

1711
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,000
We could've taken him!

1712
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:22,700
Not a real victory.

1713
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,500
I can't believe it.

1714
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,300
What's the point?

1715
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,300
What's the point?

1716
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:37,380
I could've taken him guys!

1717
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,580
I could've taken him!

1718
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,920
JohnnyLacon, thank you for the superchat.

1719
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,760
Thank you, thank you.

1720
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:51,800
Even if Doki survives this, the great bow shortage will lead to the starvation of many peasants in the coming months.

1721
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,780
Is this truly the cost of bromance?

1722
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,060
Thank you for the superchat.

1723
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,580
Thank you, thank you.

1724
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,160
Cowards.

1725
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,060
I can't believe it.

1726
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:08,740
The great Lu Bu running away like that.

1727
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,120
Goddamn cowards!

1728
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,060
We could've done it!

1729
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,620
Jansky, thank you for the superchat.

1730
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:23,540
Thank you, thank you.

1731
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,680
Lu Bu, a special dialogue.

1732
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,260
Can you beat both Yuan Shao and Cao Cao by the way?

1733
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,820
I was going to!

1734
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,020
I could've done it!

1735
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,220
Ooh, that's true.

1736
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,380
He couldn't defeat an entire army like me.

1737
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,640
And they wrote stories about him?

1738
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:04,600
What about me?

1739
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,180
I literally took on two entire armies!

1740
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,360
And I almost won.

1741
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,040
You'll have to forgive those who would err that way.

1742
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,400
I might have won, but I almost did.

1743
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:52,640
Look, if I look less generic, people will remember me too.

1744
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:18,260
That's true, a thousand people that died to like save this one guy.

1745
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,240
Hello, I'm here?

1746
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,200
Hello?

1747
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:26,660
In front of me?

1748
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:27,840
Hello?

1749
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,340
Did I not just beat up Cao Cao's army by myself?

1750
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:32,560
Like, hello?

1751
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,180
In front of me?

1752
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,080
Like, I don't know.

1753
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,600
Am I not like, am I invisible?

1754
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,160
He wrote me off of this.

1755
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,560
I literally just came back from that fight too.

1756
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,080
Oh, oh.

1757
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,180
Oh, oh.

1758
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,000
Oh, for doubt, guys.

1759
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:27,680
It was not the right decision, guys.

1760
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,460
Oh, Lupe.

1761
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:33,380
Oh, hey.

1762
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,140
Yeah, from the date we had?

1763
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,420
Like, what do you mean?

1764
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,640
Did he forgot?

1765
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:43,480
What?

1766
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,320
You invited me?

1767
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:48,980
What do you mean?

1768
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,880
I remember who you are.

1769
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,640
What do you mean she?

1770
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,800
What do you mean?

1771
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:56,600
What?

1772
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,420
We had dinner together.

1773
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,980
Oh my God, my heart.

1774
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,420
After everything we forgot already.

1775
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:17,680
I spent so much money on you.

1776
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,580
I thought we had a special...

1777
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,660
You're still thinking about Diao Chan?

1778
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,640
I sold my weapons just to be with you.

1779
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,840
Why would she be with me?

1780
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:49,580
Yeah, but like...

1781
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,120
But like...

1782
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,940
It could be like a sad thing.

1783
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,860
I can't believe it.

1784
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:09,960
I sold my weapons for him to afford our dates.

1785
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:19,200
It was like a host club situation where I used up all my income to talk to him.

1786
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:23,940
Oh my God, he host clubbed me.

1787
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:31,140
Oh my God, who put the incense in my room again?

1788
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:42,480
Nonetheless, these ideals mark him as a man capable of rising above all others.

1789
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:51,640
If they become reality, the snake that crawls the earth will take flight and rule the sky as a dragon.

1790
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,320
Guardian of peace.

1791
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,640
Dude, start speaking in real.

1792
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:03,520
If you believe that Liu Bei is the hero that will bring an end to the chaos, then walk alongside him.

1793
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,720
Alice, thank you for the super chat.

1794
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,580
Thank you, thank you.

1795
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,220
I just need more buns.

1796
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,740
Chatoki 2025.

1797
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1798
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,640
Thank you, thank you.

1799
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,600
I went to debt for Lu Bu.

1800
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:22,020
And then he's like, Hey you, I remember you.

1801
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:22,800
You're with the chat.

1802
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,900
I was with you!

1803
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:28,920
Remember Moongrass?

1804
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:31,420
It's one of the aromics I had you bring to me for your treatment.

1805
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,960
I neglected to mention it before, but its scent is also known for its ability to focus the mind.

1806
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:41,940
You spend a lot of time refining pyroxen into gems, and I think it might just be the thing to help you in your work.

1807
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:47,800
If you come across any Moongrass on your travels, I highly recommend taking it with you.

1808
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,920
Okay, now harvest Moongrass.

1809
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:50,440
Whoops.

1810
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:53,740
I forgot.

1811
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,860
My zero is buying to it.

1812
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,640
Jarhons, thank you for the super chat.

1813
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,380
Thank you, thank you.

1814
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,780
We could have been dating.

1815
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,540
I mean taking him.

1816
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:02,900
No!

1817
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,620
Thank you for the super chat.

1818
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:05,480
Thank you, thank you.

1819
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,720
Oh, Lupe.

1820
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,680
Our shared dream.

1821
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,540
I want to talk to you.

1822
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:12,640
Just the two of us.

1823
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,780
Just the two of us.

1824
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,020
Lupe's my rebound.

1825
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:26,780
After my heart was broken, he is my rebound.

1826
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:31,940
I hope that you will not dread my visit as yet another problem to solve.

1827
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,420
I also need to keep this from Guan Yun and Zhang Fei.

1828
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
There is something I need to tell you and you alone.

1829
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,640
I look forward to seeing you.

1830
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:47,540
And his brothers don't even know.

1831
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,380
Alright, where is he?

1832
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,900
Jonathan, thank you for the super chat.

1833
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:53,960
Thank you, thank you.

1834
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,620
Lupe, who is this in there?

1835
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,760
Thank you for the super chat.

1836
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,460
Thank you.

1837
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,340
There is something I need to talk with you about.

1838
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:00,140
Alright.

1839
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:06,620
I would go to Guan Yun and Zhang Fei with this, but let's just say it's a delicate subject with those two.

1840
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:07,760
Is it confession time?

1841
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,520
Of course, I don't mind.

1842
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,280
Thanks.

1843
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:12,480
You're a great help.

1844
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,960
I wanted to discuss Lord Li Bu.

1845
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,220
You've just welcomed him to Shu.

1846
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,800
We're talking about Lu Bu?

1847
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,160
Bro, what about me?

1848
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,340
What about my name?

1849
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:24,800
What do you mean?

1850
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,800
I need to bring him up!

1851
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:42,320
I can't believe we're still talking about Lu Bu after all this time.

1852
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,360
We're still talking about him.

1853
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,700
Even when he's not here, we still talk about him.

1854
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:01,660
Oh!

1855
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,580
It's just me?

1856
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:12,540
Oh my god!

1857
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:14,760
I have a tighter bond than sworn brothers?

1858
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:18,780
Oh!

1859
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,240
Yeah!

1860
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,640
Your life is yours to live in whatever way you wish.

1861
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:36,640
Beyond this point, you must discern which heroes are capable of achieving peace so that you can choose a faction to join.

1862
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:40,240
Your action may also draw you to a single faction.

1863
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,460
Heed their call and continue your journey.

1864
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,520
If you're aligned with multiple factions, you will be forced to choose between the two.

1865
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:50,180
Reflect on your experiences and think carefully when making the choice.

1866
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,780
I'll join you.

1867
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,280
Don't worry.

1868
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:55,520
I'll join you, my rebound.

1869
01:42:58,060 --> 01:42:59,700
JL, thank you for the super chat.

1870
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,080
Thank you.

1871
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:00,680
Thank you.

1872
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,120
You went into debt with the mafia for him.

1873
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:04,800
I know it!

1874
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:06,540
Then he forgot about me?

1875
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1876
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:09,360
Thank you.

1877
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,040
Thank you.

1878
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,000
Nice.

1879
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:12,300
Finally, we did it.

1880
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,520
We finally, after eight streams, we finally joined a fucking faction.

1881
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,120
I've joined Lu Bu.

1882
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,980
I just felt all the tension leave my body.

1883
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,380
I am so deeply relieved.

1884
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,120
What am I saying?

1885
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,700
I'm already embarrassing myself again, aren't I?

1886
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:38,180
You were very special to me.

1887
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:42,720
I hope we can make the most of the time we have together.

1888
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,000
How special, Lu Bu.

1889
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,800
My rebound.

1890
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,060
Thank you for the super chat.

1891
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:58,460
Thank you.

1892
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,060
Thank you.

1893
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,240
I lost everything because of you.

1894
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,760
I don't even know who you are.

1895
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:05,460
My heart.

1896
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,160
My heart.

1897
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,780
How many chapters is there anyway?

1898
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,320
He made great efforts to establish a new regime centered on Shu.

1899
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:35,300
In the face of this, Yuan Shao and the other powerful clans could not remain docile, and their ambitions were soon laid bare.

1900
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:42,180
Elsewhere, Sun Ce worked with Zhou Yu on a plan... Oh, Zhou Yu came back?

1901
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,000
His roommate came back, guys.

1902
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,640
Possibilities seemed to stretch out all the way to the horizon.

1903
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,720
Although Liu Bei had now allied with the peerless warrior Lu Bu, he fell into doubt.

1904
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,420
Unable to decide on the path he should take.

1905
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:07,420
With the entire land facing great uncertainty, it's his responsibility to capture the city.

1906
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:10,220
Cao Cao rises up to the job.

1907
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,860
Liu Bei faces a quandary in Xiapei.

1908
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:18,200
Cao Cao fights a decisive battle at Guandu.

1909
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:28,350
Jade, thank you for the super chat.

1910
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

1911
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:31,150
Have you read The Ravages of Time manga?

1912
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:32,750
I highly recommend it.

1913
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:37,150
It's the whole stage of the Three Kingdoms of a totally different saga of the Three Kingdoms.

1914
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:38,150
A totally different take.

1915
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:38,710
No, I haven't.

1916
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:40,390
I might look at... check it out after the stream.

1917
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:41,430
But thank you for the super chat.

1918
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:42,370
Thank you, thank you.

1919
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:46,870
I'm green now!

1920
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:46,890
Oh.

1921
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:54,370
I'm gonna blend right in.

1922
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:55,650
On the grass.

1923
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:57,350
Camouflage.

1924
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:04,190
This is barely green.

1925
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,630
Wait, I'm not even green.

1926
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,410
I have no regrets.

1927
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,930
I'm making decisions after being broken up with by Liu Bei.

1928
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:22,950
Clearly, my mind is sound.

1929
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:26,170
It's not even green.

1930
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:29,370
What outfit did I change into?

1931
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,170
Wait,

1932
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:43,010
he's red.

1933
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:44,930
Why did we let her red here?

1934
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:49,390
This is green territory.

1935
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:05,150
What?

1936
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:28,210
Oh.

1937
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:30,690
Oh, Cao Cao's puppeteering right now.

1938
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:34,730
Oh.

1939
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:49,930
Yes, the most trustworthy of the two.

1940
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:55,490
I want Liu Bei to grow a mustache!

1941
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:58,070
You own land now!

1942
01:47:58,070 --> 01:48:00,210
Just don't shave!

1943
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:10,690
Why do you talk like this if you want me to be convinced that you're not sus?

1944
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:15,330
Oh man, I will never betray you.

1945
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:18,050
You can trust me.

1946
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:24,970
Of course!

1947
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:28,950
I am the most innocent out of the two.

1948
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:39,530
Just talk normally if you want me not sus.

1949
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,710
Yes, stay here.

1950
01:49:00,350 --> 01:49:03,830
You almost died like six times from one guy.

1951
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:05,230
I don't trust you.

1952
01:49:06,990 --> 01:49:07,690
Thank you for the super chat!

1953
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:08,430
Thank you, thank you!

1954
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:12,330
Reminder that Liu Bei slept in the same bed as Guan Yun and Zhang Fei.

1955
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:14,890
But you're the one who can open up!

1956
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:17,150
We're both rebounding, okay?

1957
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:18,830
Thank you for the super chat!

1958
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:19,670
Thank you, thank you!

1959
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:22,030
Yes.

1960
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:25,650
Look, keeping watch is important, Zhang Fei.

1961
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:45,710
As long as we don't put him near any alcohol, it should be fine, right?

1962
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:51,650
More booze at home!

1963
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:52,010
Yippee!

1964
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:59,870
His entire purpose, god!

1965
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:04,470
I mean, there's still one other option.

1966
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:05,390
You know?

1967
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:16,750
He didn't say anything.

1968
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:20,990
He's like, thanks for cheering me up.

1969
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:23,370
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

1970
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:25,070
Me.

1971
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:27,190
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

1972
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:28,510
I'm helping.

1973
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:30,250
Oh, wait.

1974
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:31,250
Nice.

1975
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:31,970
We need that.

1976
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:33,110
Oh, I have a letter!

1977
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:39,850
Wait, I can't fight yet.

1978
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:42,730
I have to... Oh, I am so underleveled.

1979
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,790
Oh, hey!

1980
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:45,650
Everybody's here!

1981
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:46,510
Hey, guys!

1982
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:51,590
Would you be willing to assist me with something?

1983
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:53,110
Oh, a request.

1984
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:55,330
How about you?

1985
01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:59,570
I see you got an adventure ahead of me.

1986
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:01,810
A fine test of a man's metal.

1987
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:03,390
Okay.

1988
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:04,510
I got another request.

1989
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:06,070
Alright, let me look at my letters.

1990
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:07,930
I gotta look at my fan mail real quick.

1991
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:12,530
So, two hundred and... I am broke!

1992
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:15,010
I do not have that money.

1993
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:16,350
Oh, my god.

1994
01:51:16,410 --> 01:51:16,750
Okay.

1995
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:19,070
It's time to sell, apparently.

1996
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:23,030
Oh, my god.

1997
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,430
What do you mean?

1998
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:25,670
Two hundred and...

1999
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:29,110
I spent all my money at the host club!

2000
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:33,030
At the Chinese General Host Club!

2001
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:36,430
Okay.

2002
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:39,850
This is not fair.

2003
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:42,150
I spent all my money there.

2004
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:46,570
Alright.

2005
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:49,510
Let's see.

2006
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,820
What the fuck?

2007
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,700
A hundred and fifty-two?

2008
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,740
What weapon is this?

2009
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:01,180
Why is it so strong?

2010
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,100
The money well spent.

2011
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:07,420
Wow.

2012
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,340
Throwing silver coin.

2013
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:10,900
Oh!

2014
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:11,380
Oh!

2015
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:11,880
Oh!

2016
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,440
This is Zhugotlan.

2017
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,740
Do you remember when we last met?

2018
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,840
I mentioned I would invite you to my retreat.

2019
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:24,260
I recently felt that it was a good time to show you how life is deep into these mountains and decide to reach out to you once more.

2020
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,620
The road here is a bit steep, but you can make the journey.

2021
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,040
Oh!

2022
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:27,440
Oh!

2023
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:27,920
Oh!

2024
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:28,680
Let's go!

2025
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:29,000
Let's go!

2026
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:29,320
Let's go!

2027
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:29,780
Let's go!

2028
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:30,480
Let's go!

2029
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:30,800
Let's go!

2030
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:31,320
Let's go!

2031
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,080
Let's go!

2032
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,300
I'm going to visit the host club!

2033
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,920
My favorite host is there!

2034
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:37,660
Let's go!

2035
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,180
Let's go!

2036
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:46,720
Guys, my favorite host is there right now!

2037
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:47,840
I need to go!

2038
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,920
Wait, where did he... okay, here.

2039
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,200
Do not...

2040
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:57,860
Stop spending money on them!

2041
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:59,240
They don't understand!

2042
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:00,460
Oh my god!

2043
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,540
Oh wait, that's not him.

2044
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,580
That's just an old man.

2045
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:04,520
He has some stuff.

2046
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:06,540
Okay.

2047
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:07,740
What is this?

2048
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,540
Wait, where is he?

2049
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:10,480
Chuko-Lan!

2050
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:12,220
Chuko-Lan!

2051
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:13,660
Where are you?

2052
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:14,660
I'm here!

2053
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,280
My favorite host is here!

2054
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,000
Where is he?

2055
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:26,620
Oh!

2056
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:27,500
Hello!

2057
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:29,520
Don't worry!

2058
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,620
I withdrew some funds!

2059
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:34,280
I withdrew some funds!

2060
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:36,980
From my bank!

2061
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:37,940
To talk to you!

2062
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:41,380
Please!

2063
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:42,900
No more host club!

2064
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,160
The dragoons are sad!

2065
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:56,400
I swear I saw it.

2066
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:58,380
The journey was long indeed.

2067
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:01,600
I'm just...

2068
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,060
Mentally, there's a mustache in my head.

2069
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:11,980
Just me?

2070
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,080
Oh my god, he hasn't met his wife yet.

2071
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,240
That means there's a chance.

2072
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:18,040
I would change history so he never meets his wife.

2073
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,520
I'm gonna change history.

2074
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:22,620
Thank you!

2075
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,100
You are special!

2076
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:31,720
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

2077
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:36,760
Still, the gift is, as you so surmised, vegetable in nature.

2078
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:44,400
On a different note, I have heard you serve Lord Liu Bei as of late.

2079
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:48,840
Tales of your exploits have reached even my ears.

2080
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:57,440
For you, a guardian of peace, to treat yourself so wholeheartedly is in a word.

2081
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:02,000
He's gonna be interested in me over his wife.

2082
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:03,880
His future ex-wife.

2083
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,540
Because there won't be a wife.

2084
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:16,220
Guardian of peace, killer of millions.

2085
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,560
Oh my god.

2086
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,740
Browse some ideas.

2087
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:28,540
I can't believe he chose Liu Bei as his master.

2088
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:34,120
It's not homewrecking!

2089
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:36,500
It's like they never got together.

2090
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:39,440
If I change the fate, and they never meet.

2091
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:49,200
Perhaps one could just as easily call it the rationalization of an arrogant man.

2092
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,640
One neglecting to do his duty at that.

2093
01:55:52,700 --> 01:56:00,940
Living here, isolated from the world, makes it a common occurrence to go days without speaking to a single soul.

2094
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:06,760
It would seem having you here has rendered me quite loquacious indeed.

2095
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:10,120
What is more, I appreciate the restraint.

2096
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:16,540
I half expected an attempt to recruit me into Lord Liu Bei's cadre of tacticians.

2097
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:25,920
When the time comes for me to choose my master, I wish to try something for now unclouded by preconceived notions.

2098
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:29,500
Now then, will you be setting off tomorrow?

2099
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:34,480
You are welcome to stay here, modest though my retreat may be.

2100
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:40,500
Remain here as long as you like, or as long as you can stomach such close quarters.

2101
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:56,080
Oh my god!

2102
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:56,580
Oh my god!

2103
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:57,800
Did you see the side eye?

2104
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,780
Did you see the side eye?

2105
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,300
Okay guys, I need to use the bathroom.

2106
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:09,060
I'll be right back.

2107
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,500
Actually, I was like, oh I need to use the bathroom.

2108
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,780
No, this conversation is very important.

2109
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:16,740
I'll be right back, guys.

2110
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:38,770
I'm back.

2111
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:40,050
I'm back, guys.

2112
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:44,890
NotSoDeadPool, thank you for the super chat.

2113
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,810
Thank you, thank you.

2114
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:51,010
Reminder, Adoki, these host club visits can't be marked as business expense.

2115
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:54,190
It can't be if I'm streaming it, guys.

2116
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:56,530
Thank you for the super chat.

2117
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:57,590
Thank you, thank you.

2118
01:59:57,790 --> 01:59:58,670
It is.

2119
01:59:58,730 --> 01:59:59,570
I streamed it.

2120
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:01,150
It's a business expense now.

2121
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:09,870
Thank you.

2122
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:10,630
Thank you for the super chat.

2123
02:00:10,790 --> 02:00:11,710
Thank you, thank you.

2124
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:29,170
Thank you.

2125
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:31,390
This is my medical doctor, by the way.

2126
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:35,310
This is my licensed doctor that's supposed to, like, take care of me.

2127
02:00:35,610 --> 02:00:36,910
He is now thinking...

2128
02:00:36,910 --> 02:00:40,610
He is now assuming in his medical report that I am a cat.

2129
02:00:48,070 --> 02:00:48,590
Alright,

2130
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:52,490
we don't care.

2131
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,570
...to see potential.

2132
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:07,210
The only gems created will be those you saw.

2133
02:01:07,490 --> 02:01:09,290
Incense only has an effect once.

2134
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:14,990
If you use incense while creating any gems and then use another incense, the first effect will be overridden.

2135
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:18,150
Oh, okay.

2136
02:01:18,930 --> 02:01:19,450
So...

2137
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:20,270
Alright, okay.

2138
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,200
What is it?

2139
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:30,920
Oh, so it increases that specific gem.

2140
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,460
You know what?

2141
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:32,940
I need the range anyway.

2142
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:34,500
Yeah, that's fine.

2143
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:35,320
Actually, these are good.

2144
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:35,640
Fine.

2145
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:37,480
Alright.

2146
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,020
I'll only get this.

2147
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,320
Yeah, I actually wanted those specific gems anyway.

2148
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:47,160
Those are the only gems I wanted.

2149
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:55,320
Boarding the ship.

2150
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,220
God!

2151
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,440
Oh, wait.

2152
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:02,760
Gems.

2153
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:04,580
Okay, wait.

2154
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:08,760
We have to go back home because my doctor wants to speak to me.

2155
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:09,760
Again.

2156
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:13,340
My doctor or... Oh, wait.

2157
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:13,820
Who is he?

2158
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:15,900
Wait, is that Yun-Yun?

2159
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:17,260
Get out!

2160
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,120
Leave!

2161
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,760
He's mine!

2162
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,120
Leave!

2163
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:25,800
How dare you!

2164
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:26,520
Leave!

2165
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,400
No!

2166
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,240
I'll send her to war.

2167
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:36,160
I'll send her to war!

2168
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,940
She'll die in the battlefield before he meets her.

2169
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:47,580
I'll change history.

2170
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,780
He's mine!

2171
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,200
Why?

2172
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,920
I stayed at his house!

2173
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,020
Bitch!

2174
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,340
I'll send her to the front line.

2175
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:08,060
And you are?

2176
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:11,840
No!

2177
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,860
You're supposed to be ugly!

2178
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:16,500
Stop!

2179
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:21,780
I came to visit here because...

2180
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:23,980
well...

2181
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:28,060
Destroying weapons is something of a specialty of yours, right?

2182
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:33,200
This lady here enjoys inventing tools that better people's lives.

2183
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:33,520
It's true!

2184
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:38,460
That's the only... People are like, why did Zhuge Liang marry her?

2185
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:39,740
She's so ugly.

2186
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:46,200
But then he's like, yeah, but it's her inner beauty because she's supposed to be like, incredibly smart and everything.

2187
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:51,780
And like, he married her for her inner beauty and mind instead of her like, looks.

2188
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,360
So why did she make him... Why did they make her pretty?

2189
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:02,500
No!

2190
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:20,980
Go back home!

2191
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,680
I don't need you here!

2192
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,940
How dare you make lives easier for people!

2193
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:32,880
Go home!

2194
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:42,620
Go home!

2195
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:50,080
I don't wanna help her.

2196
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:52,820
Wait!

2197
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:58,600
If I assist you in however way I can, I can be close to her and make sure she doesn't meet Zhuge Liang.

2198
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,520
I'll make sure you never meet him.

2199
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:10,760
But not consider my goal foolish?

2200
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:12,300
Yes.

2201
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:18,920
Many have been suspicious of my motives or doubted that the knowledge I seek will lead to anything.

2202
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:21,200
You have to meet her right after meeting Zhuge Liang.

2203
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:23,040
Like, I'm so sad.

2204
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:27,100
You should keep going.

2205
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:28,540
Maybe it'll lead to your death.

2206
02:05:29,620 --> 02:05:30,120
You're right.

2207
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:32,940
I have no time to question myself.

2208
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:34,420
I shall encourage her.

2209
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:36,560
And steer her to the battlefield.

2210
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:47,660
Oh my god, if I seduce her, she won't- Then she won't fall in love with him.

2211
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:50,200
Oh yes!

2212
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,360
Fall in love with me!

2213
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:07,300
This is a long game, guys.

2214
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:19,880
Yes!

2215
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:22,400
I am the first one!

2216
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:24,480
Yes!

2217
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:28,500
It's supposed to be Zhuge Liang to be the first, but I took it.

2218
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:31,020
Now she'll not fall in love with him.

2219
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:35,040
That's good.

2220
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:37,200
That's good.

2221
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:42,600
I can't believe Tokyo is trying to NTR her.

2222
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,500
Thank you for the super chat.

2223
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:46,160
Thank you.

2224
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:46,840
Thank you.

2225
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,280
No, it's different!

2226
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:50,560
This is different, guys.

2227
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:53,880
Alright, okay.

2228
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,820
Alright, I should go see her.

2229
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,260
No, it's different.

2230
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,520
It's a long game.

2231
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:00,580
It's a long con.

2232
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:06,700
I get her interested in me so that I can have him all to myself.

2233
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:10,000
So her heart will no longer have room for him.

2234
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,980
It's just that easy.

2235
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:18,240
Alright.

2236
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:20,240
Yeah, exactly.

2237
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:22,400
It's not NTR if I take her place.

2238
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,340
Thank you for the super chat.

2239
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,300
Thank you, thank you.

2240
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:29,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2241
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:30,680
Thank you, thank you.

2242
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:46,460
Okay, it's in Albor Green.

2243
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:46,840
Alright.

2244
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:49,700
Okay, where do I have to go?

2245
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,220
Where is Yu Yang?

2246
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,720
Where is she?

2247
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,980
Oh, there she is.

2248
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:58,060
What territory is this?

2249
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:58,720
Oh, it's in Shu.

2250
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:00,840
Or, no, it's not.

2251
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:03,320
Where the fuck is she?

2252
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:07,100
Yeah, it's here.

2253
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,100
Oh, I have to go here.

2254
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:09,440
Okay.

2255
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:12,860
Oh, there she is.

2256
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:18,920
I'll make sure I see, like, any of that Albor grass or whatever.

2257
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:21,120
That?

2258
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:22,600
No, it's locked.

2259
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:26,100
Alright.

2260
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:31,040
Our talk earlier was incredibly inspiring, so much so that I cannot stop myself from coming up with new inventions.

2261
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,800
I'll let you investigate a certain location.

2262
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:36,900
It's something I would be very keen to hear your opinion on.

2263
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:38,060
Oh, okay.

2264
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:40,780
Alright, I'll do her stupid quest.

2265
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:49,250
This is a long con.

2266
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:50,610
I have to do this.

2267
02:08:51,090 --> 02:08:54,370
I have to be her muse so I can have him all to myself.

2268
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:56,910
Alright.

2269
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:57,530
Guys, this is...

2270
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:00,430
This is just a long con.

2271
02:09:01,550 --> 02:09:03,050
Okay, now I can change.

2272
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:05,330
Alright, let's see.

2273
02:09:05,550 --> 02:09:06,830
Where is my spear?

2274
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:11,470
Alright.

2275
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:17,670
Come on, come on.

2276
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:18,210
Excuse me.

2277
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:19,890
Guys, guys, excuse me.

2278
02:09:19,950 --> 02:09:24,210
I'm trying to... trying to get my fucking 200 kills here.

2279
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:27,930
I'm in like Tau Tau's territory for some reason.

2280
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:30,570
Nice.

2281
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:31,010
Alright.

2282
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:34,110
Alright, let me get you out of the way.

2283
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:35,110
You're annoying me.

2284
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:36,490
There you go.

2285
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:38,690
That's fine.

2286
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:40,690
That's fine.

2287
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:42,790
Let me get this general out of the way.

2288
02:09:43,970 --> 02:09:44,190
Alright.

2289
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:47,470
Goddamn, stop!

2290
02:09:47,670 --> 02:09:48,510
Stop, chariot!

2291
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:48,710
Bitch!

2292
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:50,930
Alright.

2293
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:54,170
Oh my god, like, I... he's just...

2294
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:55,170
They're just riding around me.

2295
02:09:58,170 --> 02:09:59,030
There you go.

2296
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:00,410
I destroyed one.

2297
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:02,110
Nice.

2298
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:04,170
Now we gotta destroy this one.

2299
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:05,330
Okay.

2300
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:07,090
Get over here.

2301
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:08,630
Get over here.

2302
02:10:09,310 --> 02:10:10,290
What are you poking?

2303
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:11,470
Come on.

2304
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:14,590
Get over here.

2305
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:16,710
Just drag me over here.

2306
02:10:16,710 --> 02:10:17,710
Nice.

2307
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:18,350
Alright.

2308
02:10:19,710 --> 02:10:21,090
I'll just be over here.

2309
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:22,070
Nice.

2310
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,950
Easy.

2311
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:37,490
How much more do I need?

2312
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:37,890
Okay.

2313
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:42,750
Very accurate fight.

2314
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:45,270
They got it, like, hooked up to me.

2315
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:47,470
Alright, I did your mission.

2316
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:51,110
Also, how much more do I need for a dalion?

2317
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:52,750
Stupid...

2318
02:10:53,170 --> 02:10:53,570
Thing.

2319
02:10:54,070 --> 02:10:55,270
That shit's taking so long.

2320
02:10:56,230 --> 02:10:56,470
Alright.

2321
02:10:56,730 --> 02:10:58,630
50 more and then I need more of that.

2322
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:00,490
And I still need to do the perfect evade.

2323
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:02,950
I'll do that next to a boss.

2324
02:11:05,790 --> 02:11:06,510
Yeah, I did.

2325
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:09,490
Please allow me to visit you later.

2326
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:10,690
To hear about it in detail.

2327
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:11,310
Alright.

2328
02:11:11,710 --> 02:11:12,850
Nice, I did her thing.

2329
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:15,370
Uh...

2330
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:16,630
I need to do...

2331
02:11:16,630 --> 02:11:18,690
Guan Yun and Zhang Fei.

2332
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:21,050
Blade of Honor.

2333
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:23,070
Where is it?

2334
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:23,950
Oh, there you go.

2335
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:25,750
Challenged by Zhang Fei.

2336
02:11:27,610 --> 02:11:28,810
Alright, let's do it.

2337
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,000
I don't know what he wants me to do.

2338
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:40,160
But more than farm my XP for Riz.

2339
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:41,760
My Riz-P.

2340
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:44,060
Oh, it's to challenge him.

2341
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:44,280
Okay.

2342
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:46,140
Okay.

2343
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,580
You know what?

2344
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:48,660
Let me use my new weapon.

2345
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:52,740
I had one that was like...

2346
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:53,900
Okay, 152.

2347
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,280
Let's try this.

2348
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:02,300
Alright.

2349
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:05,020
This is gonna be interesting.

2350
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:06,460
What?

2351
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:10,520
What?

2352
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:11,920
Oh, it's a duel!

2353
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:12,560
Oh, okay.

2354
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:13,960
Let me swap weapons again.

2355
02:12:20,610 --> 02:12:21,070
Alright.

2356
02:12:21,590 --> 02:12:23,070
I didn't realize we're dueling.

2357
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:24,650
Alright, goodbye.

2358
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:27,150
Well, if we're dueling, this is a lot easier.

2359
02:12:29,770 --> 02:12:30,590
Okay, nice.

2360
02:12:34,350 --> 02:12:35,230
Alright, Zhang Fei.

2361
02:12:35,310 --> 02:12:36,750
Are you sure you still wanna keep dueling?

2362
02:12:37,170 --> 02:12:38,130
Are you sure?

2363
02:12:39,730 --> 02:12:41,370
I mean, I can keep going.

2364
02:12:41,370 --> 02:12:42,890
Are you sure?

2365
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:45,370
I can stop anytime, Zhang Fei.

2366
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:46,970
Are you sure, buddy?

2367
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:51,030
Alright.

2368
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:54,610
You could've...

2369
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:57,090
You should've asked for surrender.

2370
02:12:58,370 --> 02:13:00,730
But he just wanted to embarrass himself.

2371
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:03,890
Alright.

2372
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:05,390
Nice.

2373
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:07,310
That was easy.

2374
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:08,650
Thank you.

2375
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:13,070
Duel more like slaughter.

2376
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:18,150
Look, if he wants to embarrass himself in front of his generals, like, that's on him.

2377
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:21,350
I gave him a chance to surrender.

2378
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:27,630
Alright, nice.

2379
02:13:31,990 --> 02:13:35,070
Well, I kicked his ass when we first met.

2380
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:36,870
You're no ordinary man.

2381
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:37,850
That much is clear.

2382
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:39,250
You're so dependable.

2383
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:40,910
You almost put me to shame.

2384
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:44,630
You stick with us all the way to the end.

2385
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:49,150
Alright, now I have to do... I assume the next one is I fight Guan Yun, right?

2386
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:52,030
The Blade of Honor?

2387
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:56,110
What's this?

2388
02:13:56,630 --> 02:13:57,930
Level 35?

2389
02:13:58,210 --> 02:13:58,690
Yeah, no.

2390
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:00,450
I'm too weak for that.

2391
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:02,830
Where's Blade of Honor?

2392
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:03,970
Ah!

2393
02:14:06,190 --> 02:14:06,710
Ah!

2394
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:06,890
Ah!

2395
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:10,350
Where the fuck is Blade of Honor?

2396
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:14,880
Ah!

2397
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,140
Oh, it's here.

2398
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:21,740
Okay, I have to go back.

2399
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,160
No, it wasn't near him.

2400
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:27,340
It's like in another area.

2401
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:28,420
Which is weird.

2402
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:30,520
It's like somewhere here.

2403
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:33,420
Yeah, it's like in this...

2404
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:34,820
It's such a big territory, too.

2405
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:36,320
Ah!

2406
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:40,820
Alright.

2407
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:42,880
The fuck is here?

2408
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:43,880
Ah!

2409
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,420
Is it here?

2410
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:49,420
No.

2411
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:50,980
Is it?

2412
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,560
Oh, it is!

2413
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:52,240
Blade of Honor.

2414
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:52,840
There you go.

2415
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:56,160
Okay, it's just people robbing.

2416
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:57,280
Alright, that's fine.

2417
02:14:58,420 --> 02:15:01,480
Now I should be able to use my spear.

2418
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:05,280
Alright, let's go.

2419
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:07,280
Ah!

2420
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:14,140
Alright.

2421
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:15,880
This one's less about...

2422
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:19,260
Okay, I have to help peasants reach the escape point.

2423
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,280
That's fine.

2424
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:22,900
There we go.

2425
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:26,040
Get outta here!

2426
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:28,200
Nice.

2427
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:31,760
C'mon, Y!

2428
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,420
Y!

2429
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:33,080
Y!

2430
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:35,200
The easiest combo there is!

2431
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:36,180
Oh wait, I should...

2432
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:37,000
I need to use this.

2433
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:41,620
I keep forgetting this one is like with X and not... Alright.

2434
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:42,680
Leave!

2435
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:48,880
Easiest combo ever!

2436
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:49,320
Sorry, no.

2437
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:50,800
The hardest combo ever.

2438
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:51,120
Alright.

2439
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:52,600
We did!

2440
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:55,000
Okay, we just did...

2441
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:55,960
What the fuck did I just do?

2442
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:59,340
I'm like... Alright, we did something.

2443
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:01,240
Okay, now it's just this attack.

2444
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:02,880
There we go.

2445
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:04,240
I just gotta do this all the time.

2446
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:06,880
There we go.

2447
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:08,340
I finished it.

2448
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:09,920
Now it's gone.

2449
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:12,100
Alright, we successfully...

2450
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:14,920
Now we gotta do perfect evades, however that's done.

2451
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:17,320
I still don't really know how to do that.

2452
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:23,260
With attacks from a wheel recovery?

2453
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:24,660
Fucking no.

2454
02:16:26,140 --> 02:16:27,460
Just like, ow.

2455
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:28,540
Alright.

2456
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,740
Let's go back to my wheelies.

2457
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:34,940
Alright.

2458
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:40,560
Alright, let me see if I can do a perfect evade.

2459
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:43,260
I don't know how, but let's see if I could.

2460
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:45,760
Oh!

2461
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:46,680
Wait, was that it?

2462
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:47,300
Wait, wait, wait.

2463
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:47,520
Okay.

2464
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:48,140
Attack me!

2465
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:49,540
Attack me!

2466
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,000
Come on!

2467
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,000
Oh my god!

2468
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:53,840
Okay, I'm farming this.

2469
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:54,560
I'm farming this.

2470
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:56,380
I'm farming it.

2471
02:16:57,640 --> 02:16:58,120
Oh no.

2472
02:16:58,220 --> 02:16:58,420
Wait, wait.

2473
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,180
Okay, I did two.

2474
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:00,820
Three!

2475
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:05,340
Give me a sec, I'm gonna farm this.

2476
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:06,760
Come on.

2477
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:09,000
Oh shit, okay.

2478
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:10,420
I didn't do it.

2479
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:10,820
It's okay.

2480
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:12,060
Four!

2481
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:16,800
Oh shit.

2482
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,140
It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

2483
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:22,300
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

2484
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:23,680
Oh shit!

2485
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:29,740
Okay, okay.

2486
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:31,840
I can't do it.

2487
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,620
I just realized where I am.

2488
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:36,560
Shit!

2489
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:37,660
I'm coming back.

2490
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:40,100
I'm coming back.

2491
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,000
That's awkward.

2492
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:42,520
Whoops.

2493
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:44,580
I forgot about the peasants.

2494
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:46,520
I forgot about...

2495
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,180
Okay, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2496
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:49,640
Don't worry.

2497
02:17:51,380 --> 02:17:52,340
I'm a hero.

2498
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:55,260
Sorry, this was much more important.

2499
02:17:58,300 --> 02:17:59,400
Okay, there we go.

2500
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:00,880
Don't worry, I'm here.

2501
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,400
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

2502
02:18:02,460 --> 02:18:03,020
Open the door.

2503
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:09,100
I had- Look, I had to farm!

2504
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:12,720
There we go.

2505
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:13,740
Don't worry!

2506
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:15,920
Don't worry, I'm here!

2507
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:16,940
I'm here, I'm here.

2508
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:20,300
I'm here, I'm here.

2509
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:22,960
I'm here, guys, don't worry.

2510
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,580
Don't worry, I'll farm him.

2511
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:27,860
Oh shit, no!

2512
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:28,380
Shit, no!

2513
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:32,460
It's okay, I'm here now.

2514
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:32,900
I'm here.

2515
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,340
Guys, don't worry.

2516
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:45,460
Oh no, I didn't do it.

2517
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:48,300
Okay.

2518
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:51,480
It's fine.

2519
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:54,300
Oh my god, I need one more!

2520
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:54,920
I need one more!

2521
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,580
I need one more!

2522
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:02,120
Typical Novo for getting up, but look, this was very important.

2523
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:02,820
Wait.

2524
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:04,560
Oh my god, I did it!

2525
02:19:04,580 --> 02:19:04,900
I did it!

2526
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:05,240
Nice!

2527
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:06,800
Okay, we fight for real.

2528
02:19:08,060 --> 02:19:09,080
We fight for real.

2529
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:10,160
Alright, now kill him.

2530
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:12,320
I did what I had to do.

2531
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:13,460
I can kill him now.

2532
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:15,800
See, look at that.

2533
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:17,000
I'm a hero.

2534
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:20,880
Dude, I... I saved them!

2535
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:23,000
What do you mean?!

2536
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,680
I did my thing!

2537
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,600
I did my job.

2538
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:27,700
I saved them.

2539
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:34,960
I did what I had to do.

2540
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,600
I'm a hero.

2541
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:42,240
I wanna say that I'm a hero.

2542
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:46,600
No way!

2543
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:49,120
They're alive, okay?

2544
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:50,700
They're alive.

2545
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,300
Is that not enough?

2546
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:53,820
Look at that.

2547
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:57,820
Save what was left of them.

2548
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,880
Look, I completed my missions, okay?

2549
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,880
I completed my missions.

2550
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:07,020
Yay!

2551
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,200
Look at that.

2552
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:14,800
Perfect event.

2553
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:19,440
Alright,

2554
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:23,370
nice.

2555
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:25,070
What is this?

2556
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:28,030
Oh shit, what?

2557
02:20:28,190 --> 02:20:30,230
I could be... Oh, I need 70 for that.

2558
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,810
I should've fucking invested in this.

2559
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:40,150
Alright, nice.

2560
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:46,130
Alright, let's see.

2561
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:47,530
We gotta go...

2562
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:49,450
Wait, there's something over here.

2563
02:20:51,150 --> 02:20:52,570
What is over there?

2564
02:20:52,690 --> 02:20:54,230
Oh, is this the moongrass?

2565
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:56,990
Oh no, it's the alpagrass.

2566
02:20:57,130 --> 02:20:57,870
Okay, nice.

2567
02:20:59,390 --> 02:21:00,210
You know what?

2568
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:00,850
Fuck it.

2569
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:03,690
Actually no, I don't have any actual missions though.

2570
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:09,530
Duel, defeat 5, sword training...

2571
02:21:10,570 --> 02:21:13,590
Like, none of these other ones are that important, not gonna lie.

2572
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:18,610
Yeah, they're like none of the ones that I want to seduce.

2573
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:21,830
So I don't need to do it.

2574
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:27,190
Alright, I need to go back home?

2575
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:29,370
Alright, who do I... Yuan Hao?

2576
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:31,550
No, I don't need to talk to you.

2577
02:21:31,570 --> 02:21:32,430
Oh, Guan Yu is over here.

2578
02:21:32,610 --> 02:21:33,650
Yeah, there you go.

2579
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:35,450
Wait, Zhang Fei wants to talk again?

2580
02:21:36,970 --> 02:21:38,530
Oh, let's talk to Guan Yu first.

2581
02:21:40,470 --> 02:21:40,830
Yay!

2582
02:21:43,650 --> 02:21:46,710
Until then, it falls to the likes of us to win these small victories.

2583
02:21:47,170 --> 02:21:51,110
If for no reason, then to give people hope, a reason to live another day.

2584
02:21:51,430 --> 02:21:55,050
I hope you will share in my mission for as long as this righteousness lives within us.

2585
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:59,450
We will have many more chances yet to make this world just a little better.

2586
02:22:00,010 --> 02:22:01,030
Alright, Zhang Fei.

2587
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:01,990
We're bonding!

2588
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:03,670
We're gonna bond!

2589
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:05,590
You guys wanna watch us bond?

2590
02:22:09,210 --> 02:22:09,650
Outside?

2591
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:10,550
At night?

2592
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:14,670
Wanna see the flowers at night again?

2593
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:18,350
It's nice here, isn't it?

2594
02:22:19,170 --> 02:22:19,650
Sure.

2595
02:22:22,830 --> 02:22:24,270
I like it here.

2596
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:25,090
I do.

2597
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,890
Then let's stay here a while.

2598
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:30,470
I've been meaning to talk with you.

2599
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:31,450
Under the stars?

2600
02:22:31,650 --> 02:22:32,430
Under the tree?

2601
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:33,970
You've been doing a great job.

2602
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:35,190
Where the flowers blossom?

2603
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:39,350
My brothers have really started to depend on you.

2604
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:41,110
Alright guys, grab a chair!

2605
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:44,170
I'm glad I made all that effort to win you over to our side.

2606
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:53,510
I'm glad I made all the effort to win you over to our side.

2607
02:22:54,130 --> 02:22:56,750
That was what convinced me, okay?

2608
02:22:57,290 --> 02:22:57,710
Really?

2609
02:22:58,390 --> 02:22:59,970
I'm glad to hear that.

2610
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:01,950
Just you, Zhang Fei.

2611
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:03,130
I've been thinking about that time a lot lately.

2612
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:08,770
But you really like it here, don't you?

2613
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:12,590
You've even started thinking of it as home?

2614
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:17,370
You've already become one of us.

2615
02:23:17,950 --> 02:23:18,950
I'm waiting for Zhuge Liang.

2616
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:20,570
I'm waiting for him.

2617
02:23:20,810 --> 02:23:23,110
From now on, you're part of the family.

2618
02:23:24,010 --> 02:23:27,330
That's how much you've come to mean to us.

2619
02:23:28,330 --> 02:23:29,730
I'm not here for them.

2620
02:23:29,870 --> 02:23:30,990
I'm here for Zhuge Liang.

2621
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:31,910
I don't know what better off than we were.

2622
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:35,050
There's still more work to be done.

2623
02:23:37,550 --> 02:23:41,530
The three of us always live life on the edge.

2624
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:44,650
Will you remain by our side?

2625
02:23:45,310 --> 02:23:46,270
For us all?

2626
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:55,330
Now, a straight talker.

2627
02:23:56,690 --> 02:23:57,490
I like that.

2628
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:02,770
Alright, let's enjoy the rest of the night.

2629
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:05,630
Let's make a promise.

2630
02:24:06,530 --> 02:24:11,210
If either of us gets injured, the other has to nurse the dead to health.

2631
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:16,390
Fade to black.

2632
02:24:16,870 --> 02:24:18,010
Why me?

2633
02:24:18,130 --> 02:24:21,790
I do not have the medical license to nurse you back together.

2634
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:30,910
I am not... I do not have the license to take care of you.

2635
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:34,170
I don't know how to fucking sew a wound.

2636
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:37,910
Interpreting doctor.

2637
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:42,370
Please tell me your secrets.

2638
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:44,290
I have a favor to ask of you.

2639
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:48,650
You possess knowledge regarding the secrets of a variety of weaponry.

2640
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:50,570
Can I ask you to teach me what you know?

2641
02:24:51,050 --> 02:24:53,110
You're the only one I can ask such a thing.

2642
02:24:53,570 --> 02:24:56,350
This is you alone who have accepted everything above.

2643
02:24:56,530 --> 02:24:56,850
Yes!

2644
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,790
Yes!

2645
02:24:59,110 --> 02:25:01,570
I am taking Zhuge Liang's place.

2646
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:02,610
Yes!

2647
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:04,810
She will not fall in love with him.

2648
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:06,030
Yes!

2649
02:25:08,590 --> 02:25:11,210
She only has eyes for me now.

2650
02:25:12,370 --> 02:25:12,970
Alright.

2651
02:25:13,450 --> 02:25:14,090
Wait!

2652
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:17,730
Might I visit you tonight?

2653
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:23,630
Given our shared history, you might wonder why I wrote you this request.

2654
02:25:23,970 --> 02:25:27,810
But it's precisely because of our history that I wish to meet.

2655
02:25:28,410 --> 02:25:31,230
I'm doing like back to back to back to back.

2656
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:33,570
We're missing right now.

2657
02:25:33,930 --> 02:25:34,990
Oh my god.

2658
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:36,570
Guys, I don't know if I have enough energy.

2659
02:25:37,890 --> 02:25:41,870
My body is weak, but my mind is strong.

2660
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:46,510
I just need more water, guys.

2661
02:25:46,730 --> 02:25:54,910
I hope to talk with you in detail and at length about the days we've spent together and the memories we've shared.

2662
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:57,670
I look forward to seeing you.

2663
02:26:01,850 --> 02:26:05,190
The flesh is weak, but the spirit is willing.

2664
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:06,570
Oh, there he is.

2665
02:26:06,630 --> 02:26:07,570
Who do I talk to?

2666
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:08,350
Oh my god.

2667
02:26:08,970 --> 02:26:11,690
Oh my god, they're both waiting for me outside.

2668
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:13,990
Okay, Guanyin first.

2669
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:16,570
Guanyin first.

2670
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:22,290
Keep hydrating, you got a busy night.

2671
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:27,530
Oh my god.

2672
02:26:27,530 --> 02:26:29,470
This place has the feeling of a second home.

2673
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:34,370
Talking with you always brings me such irreplaceable joy.

2674
02:26:35,810 --> 02:26:36,590
Okay.

2675
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:40,570
The only thing that gives him joy.

2676
02:26:41,690 --> 02:26:45,310
Our friendship has withstood quite the test of time.

2677
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:46,150
Friendship?

2678
02:26:46,650 --> 02:26:47,830
Is that what you call it?

2679
02:26:48,110 --> 02:26:53,990
Something inside me knew that would be the case on the moment we first met in Ji province.

2680
02:26:56,030 --> 02:26:58,270
I thought the same, Guanyin.

2681
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:02,610
Our bond is undeniable, to be sure.

2682
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:07,510
Now that I think about it, we fought together with Zheng Zhao back then.

2683
02:27:08,090 --> 02:27:12,710
Taking the leader of the Yellow Turbans as an ally, punishing government officials.

2684
02:27:13,730 --> 02:27:16,350
What wild tribulations fate had in store for us.

2685
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:21,630
I'll never forget that day, Guanyin.

2686
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:24,270
You and I on the battlefield.

2687
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:27,510
After the battle, the two of us.

2688
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:34,870
Though we parted ways with Zheng Zhao, you and I have long had our eyes fixed on the same goal.

2689
02:27:35,630 --> 02:27:43,090
Side by side, to the deftest part, I'm pretty sure you'll die first.

2690
02:27:55,010 --> 02:27:57,950
Let's not talk about him, just talk about you and I.

2691
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:10,250
It's no exaggeration to say, I consider it a blessing from the heavens.

2692
02:28:11,910 --> 02:28:15,570
You will play an essential part in Li Bei's campaign.

2693
02:28:16,050 --> 02:28:17,710
I believe that's actually true.

2694
02:28:18,610 --> 02:28:21,310
I've known you longer than even my sworn brothers.

2695
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:23,890
Your comrade like no other.

2696
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:26,650
Your presence fills me with confidence.

2697
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:40,360
I'll make every effort for you.

2698
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:49,160
Hearing such determination from you was so deeply moved.

2699
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:55,400
May your wings of righteousness spread wide, my friend.

2700
02:28:56,380 --> 02:28:58,200
Let us continue to work together.

2701
02:28:58,900 --> 02:28:59,900
To ponder together.

2702
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:03,060
And on occasion, spread our wings together.

2703
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:11,320
After that, we shall ensure that Liu Bei accomplishes great things.

2704
02:29:36,930 --> 02:29:37,990
I see.

2705
02:29:39,130 --> 02:29:41,350
So that weapon's power comes from there.

2706
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:44,130
An interesting insight indeed.

2707
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:48,370
Thank you once again for your wisdom.

2708
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:53,990
Um... could we speak for a little while longer?

2709
02:29:55,970 --> 02:30:00,250
There is something I wanted to talk about with an experienced warrior like you.

2710
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:02,910
Yes, of course.

2711
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:05,370
Thank you.

2712
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:09,370
Your kindness is much appreciated.

2713
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:16,410
Earlier, I mentioned that I want to create things that will make people's lives easier.

2714
02:30:17,650 --> 02:30:22,650
Where I'm from, there is a chronic shortage of laborers due to the war.

2715
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:27,630
So, I designed and created a wooden doll.

2716
02:30:28,190 --> 02:30:30,650
A wooden- she made a robot?!

2717
02:30:31,890 --> 02:30:33,910
She did a Boston robot?!

2718
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:35,190
So it was quite rudimentary.

2719
02:30:36,210 --> 02:30:38,370
It could only make a dough-pounding motion.

2720
02:30:38,890 --> 02:30:40,670
What the- witch!

2721
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:42,870
At first, there were people who were happy to see it.

2722
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:44,390
The old robot.

2723
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:46,430
Saying it helped with their daily cooking.

2724
02:30:46,690 --> 02:30:48,450
In ancient China.

2725
02:30:48,450 --> 02:30:51,550
One day, officials came unannounced.

2726
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:54,070
Oh my god!

2727
02:30:54,190 --> 02:30:55,730
She's like, witchcraft!

2728
02:30:55,950 --> 02:30:57,250
Get rid of the robot!

2729
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:01,750
The Magistrate's office had received complaints that the doll moved using some suspicious device.

2730
02:31:02,290 --> 02:31:08,010
When the officials were getting ready to leave with the doll parts, they said this.

2731
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:13,810
If you're going to build such a thing, you ought to make it able to wield a weapon.

2732
02:31:14,830 --> 02:31:15,270
And fight.

2733
02:31:15,970 --> 02:31:16,870
I was shocked.

2734
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:21,710
I couldn't fathom that there were people who didn't like what I had made.

2735
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:24,930
And those who wished to- The device of the devil!

2736
02:31:25,630 --> 02:31:26,230
Demon!

2737
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:30,590
Using it as a weapon?

2738
02:31:32,670 --> 02:31:33,270
Well...

2739
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:37,410
Those who fight wars always demand the most advanced inventions available.

2740
02:31:38,770 --> 02:31:40,290
In the end...

2741
02:31:40,290 --> 02:31:42,110
Apparently, my doll was rebuilt.

2742
02:31:42,350 --> 02:31:43,050
What the fuck?

2743
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:43,970
And deployed as a weapon.

2744
02:31:44,650 --> 02:31:44,990
When?

2745
02:31:44,990 --> 02:31:49,390
I only found out because someone came to me to complain that it was useless in battle.

2746
02:31:50,330 --> 02:31:52,390
Yeah, it was made out of wood!

2747
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:54,090
I was glad to hear that.

2748
02:31:55,290 --> 02:31:58,070
It made me realize...

2749
02:31:58,070 --> 02:32:00,750
My inventions could be used to hurt someone.

2750
02:32:01,650 --> 02:32:04,490
Like, what the fuck is that wooden doll going to do in battle?

2751
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:08,190
Against, like, knives and swords?

2752
02:32:09,050 --> 02:32:11,510
But with those who misuse it.

2753
02:32:12,930 --> 02:32:16,490
That's why I have come to the decision to study weaponry.

2754
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:19,810
So that I can continue working on my inventions.

2755
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:24,510
Instead of dismissing research into weapons as a waste...

2756
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:28,650
I'll try to learn everything I can in order to create a better future.

2757
02:32:32,070 --> 02:32:33,390
I like that.

2758
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:35,610
I am a man with few words.

2759
02:32:35,830 --> 02:32:36,830
I like that.

2760
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:37,850
You do!

2761
02:32:39,710 --> 02:32:44,050
After she, like, poured her entire heart and soul into this conversation.

2762
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:45,870
I like that.

2763
02:32:55,770 --> 02:32:58,210
He went, thumbs up.

2764
02:32:58,670 --> 02:32:59,810
Oh jeez.

2765
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:03,410
I reacted to her conversation with thumbs up.

2766
02:33:07,850 --> 02:33:08,670
That's okay.

2767
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:11,830
That means you get less time which you got there.

2768
02:33:12,290 --> 02:33:13,410
Sure, I'll stay.

2769
02:33:15,910 --> 02:33:15,930
What?

2770
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:34,810
What are you gonna do with a life-sized doll of me?

2771
02:33:34,810 --> 02:33:35,690
What?

2772
02:33:37,130 --> 02:33:38,210
Oh,

2773
02:33:42,550 --> 02:33:44,090
she's a funky freak.

2774
02:33:44,970 --> 02:33:52,930
What is she gonna do with a very accurate life-sized doll of me?

2775
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:59,450
What parts does that include?

2776
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:02,150
What does it include?

2777
02:34:04,810 --> 02:34:06,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2778
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:09,390
I don't remember agreeing to that.

2779
02:34:11,290 --> 02:34:15,710
No, it is not an anime pillow.

2780
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:20,910
It is a type of... the first inventor of a sex doll.

2781
02:34:21,330 --> 02:34:22,810
I can't believe...

2782
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:26,090
Recorded in history.

2783
02:34:31,210 --> 02:34:33,150
She measured it.

2784
02:34:35,990 --> 02:34:39,950
Jesse, thank you for the super chat.

2785
02:34:40,090 --> 02:34:41,230
Thank you, thank you.

2786
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:43,370
Hey Doki, it was my birthday yesterday.

2787
02:34:43,530 --> 02:34:44,690
Can I get some birthday wishes?

2788
02:34:45,050 --> 02:34:48,770
And if we didn't battle, I promise to tend each other's wounds.

2789
02:34:49,210 --> 02:34:50,230
Thank you for the super chat.

2790
02:34:50,330 --> 02:34:51,170
Thank you, thank you.

2791
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:53,150
Happy birthday to you.

2792
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:55,130
Happy birthday to you.

2793
02:34:55,230 --> 02:34:57,090
Happy birthday, dear Jesse.

2794
02:34:57,470 --> 02:34:59,070
Happy birthday to you.

2795
02:34:59,150 --> 02:35:00,630
Yeah, happy birthday!

2796
02:35:02,490 --> 02:35:06,010
Ever since we spoke the other day, I can't stop thinking about you.

2797
02:35:06,350 --> 02:35:09,010
Or rather, the untapped well of knowledge you possess.

2798
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:12,910
As it happens, I have another investigation I need help with.

2799
02:35:13,170 --> 02:35:18,290
And I'd like to spend as much time as possible going over the results with you.

2800
02:35:18,410 --> 02:35:19,570
Alright, let's do this.

2801
02:35:21,410 --> 02:35:22,950
Let's do this, unfortunately.

2802
02:35:26,690 --> 02:35:27,750
Alright, here we go.

2803
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:31,790
The Dragons, thank you for the super chat.

2804
02:35:31,890 --> 02:35:32,610
Thank you, thank you.

2805
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:37,290
As a fellow Three Kingdoms fanboy, I greatly appreciate the Three Kingdoms streams.

2806
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:38,450
Thank you for the super chat.

2807
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:39,570
Thank you, thank you.

2808
02:35:39,690 --> 02:35:41,530
I'm so happy you've been joining them.

2809
02:35:43,210 --> 02:35:44,990
Thank you so much for the super chat.

2810
02:35:45,810 --> 02:35:47,490
Can't wait to put them to use.

2811
02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:49,690
Alright, let's get him out of here.

2812
02:35:50,010 --> 02:35:51,330
Alright, what are the weapons?

2813
02:35:53,930 --> 02:35:55,590
What weapons are they?

2814
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:57,330
Is it the horse?

2815
02:35:57,950 --> 02:35:59,450
Oh, it's the chariot.

2816
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:01,270
Bro, it's the same weapon!

2817
02:36:04,150 --> 02:36:06,170
It's literally the same weapon!

2818
02:36:07,950 --> 02:36:09,830
I don't understand!

2819
02:36:11,610 --> 02:36:12,770
Alright, that's fine.

2820
02:36:12,890 --> 02:36:13,530
I can kill him.

2821
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:17,530
Alright, we just gotta have the other weapon to show up.

2822
02:36:19,850 --> 02:36:20,690
There you go.

2823
02:36:20,850 --> 02:36:21,210
Nice.

2824
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:22,010
Get out of here.

2825
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:27,410
Alright, I need to kill you for extra XP.

2826
02:36:27,650 --> 02:36:27,910
No!

2827
02:36:28,410 --> 02:36:29,010
My XP!

2828
02:36:32,990 --> 02:36:33,430
Goddammit.

2829
02:36:33,990 --> 02:36:36,150
I needed to kill him for XP, man.

2830
02:36:36,410 --> 02:36:37,110
He had more.

2831
02:36:39,310 --> 02:36:42,030
Literally, the weapon stood in front of me.

2832
02:36:42,030 --> 02:36:45,290
The weapons just had to be in range.

2833
02:36:47,870 --> 02:36:49,470
Okay, chariot with your lance.

2834
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:51,870
Nice, level up.

2835
02:36:54,370 --> 02:36:55,770
Alright, plus three.

2836
02:37:00,810 --> 02:37:01,790
Alright, Union.

2837
02:37:02,390 --> 02:37:03,310
I did the thing.

2838
02:37:05,550 --> 02:37:06,970
Sword are really easy.

2839
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:10,210
Nice, more coins.

2840
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:14,490
I'd like to talk to you, but would you mind if I came to see you?

2841
02:37:14,490 --> 02:37:15,030
We...

2842
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:17,470
We just talked.

2843
02:37:18,130 --> 02:37:19,490
You haven't...

2844
02:37:20,170 --> 02:37:20,690
Alright.

2845
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:23,070
Okay, she wants to talk again.

2846
02:37:23,810 --> 02:37:26,050
I was just with you!

2847
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,810
What more do you want from me?

2848
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:35,030
Oh my god, my body is weak, but my spirit is strong.

2849
02:37:38,470 --> 02:37:43,110
Alright, let's talk to my doctor first before we do anything.

2850
02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:46,830
I gotta make sure that I'm medically okay for this.

2851
02:37:48,730 --> 02:37:50,450
I don't think I had rest yet.

2852
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:52,050
I gotta make sure...

2853
02:37:52,050 --> 02:37:59,910
I gotta make sure that my doctor approves before I go back in.

2854
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:12,020
Am I training?

2855
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:18,080
Are these the other guardians?

2856
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:26,380
Yeah.

2857
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:29,240
Yeah, what are you trying to do?

2858
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:47,300
But he's just a child!

2859
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:54,140
No, stay as you are, Ziluan.

2860
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:58,280
Are we gonna kill a child?

2861
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:03,460
We are bound to bring peace to the realm, to protect it.

2862
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:10,640
We are not here to serve the Han, least of all when it would require handing over an innocent child to be protected.

2863
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:12,100
Yeah, I was gonna say, as a child.

2864
02:39:12,380 --> 02:39:13,040
We know that.

2865
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:18,620
But if we don't give them this child, every man and woman in this village will suffer the same fate.

2866
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:23,460
So instead of doing what's right, you'd rather live in a world where the Han completely disobey you?

2867
02:39:23,460 --> 02:39:24,740
Okay, but how does he know?

2868
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:25,960
We just cut his hair.

2869
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:28,300
We cut his hair and they won't know.

2870
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:32,620
There was once a hermit who helped Emperor Gaozu found the Han dynasty.

2871
02:39:33,440 --> 02:39:38,280
That hermit was our forefather, the original guardian of peace.

2872
02:39:39,060 --> 02:39:46,040
His goal was to find those who possessed the right qualities and teach them how to preserve peace in the realm.

2873
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:54,540
It was never to submit to the whims of a dying kingdom, to slaughter the weak and those deemed enemies by virtue of their birth.

2874
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:57,120
The Han is in its death throes.

2875
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:58,740
It cannot be saved.

2876
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:02,280
Okay, so the original guardian of peace failed his fucking job.

2877
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:08,000
He did not do his job.

2878
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:13,060
We must find the hero of this age and bring peace back to this land.

2879
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:16,820
Come, let us talk to the chief.

2880
02:40:17,420 --> 02:40:19,760
Together, we can decide what should be done.

2881
02:40:24,220 --> 02:40:26,360
Yeah, like we just cut the child's hair.

2882
02:40:26,700 --> 02:40:30,720
How- there's so many like children back then, like orphans.

2883
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:33,060
Like how would he know that's the child they're looking for?

2884
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:35,240
And the sky is growing dark.

2885
02:40:36,060 --> 02:40:38,620
I always knew it wouldn't end with the village's destruction.

2886
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:42,700
Jin Luan, this is your last chance to turn back.

2887
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:43,520
Turn back what?

2888
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:50,100
This may sound strange coming from the one who set you on this path, but what awaits you is likely a past- But the death of a child?

2889
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:51,200
I killed so many.

2890
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:52,960
One child is not gonna change anything.

2891
02:40:52,980 --> 02:40:54,800
I will force you to do anything that you don't want to.

2892
02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:56,940
Least of all for my benefit.

2893
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:05,360
I will- you're telling me this now after all the fucking incense you put me on?

2894
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:13,340
I was like, you choked me up so hard and now you tell me.

2895
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:34,180
Oh yeah, you should have told me this before you put me on fucking- all these experimental herbs.

2896
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:36,680
My father never could.

2897
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:43,480
I thought that, perhaps that I could finally claim to have surpassed my father, the man they called a saint.

2898
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:48,200
In the end, this has all been for my own selfish ends.

2899
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:50,640
Forgive me.

2900
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:53,320
Maybe it would have been better if you had never met me.

2901
02:41:53,620 --> 02:41:55,020
Oh, 100%.

2902
02:41:55,900 --> 02:41:57,680
It's you who wants to confront your past.

2903
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:02,020
I set you on that course, and I cannot turn away from you now.

2904
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:06,480
This is my responsibility, and I will not abandon it.

2905
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:12,230
No, you literally live with me for free.

2906
02:42:12,890 --> 02:42:16,050
Like, all you've done is just give me, like, herbs.

2907
02:42:17,130 --> 02:42:17,730
That's right.

2908
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:22,910
It's a rare herb that only grows naturally in same province.

2909
02:42:23,130 --> 02:42:25,170
If anyone can find it, you can.

2910
02:42:25,690 --> 02:42:27,810
Alright, another herb.

2911
02:42:28,610 --> 02:42:30,630
I haven't had fan mail in so long.

2912
02:42:30,770 --> 02:42:32,810
Where are my old ancient dragoons?

2913
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:34,610
Oh my god.

2914
02:42:34,850 --> 02:42:35,990
Oh my god.

2915
02:42:36,510 --> 02:42:37,990
Please tell me your secrets.

2916
02:42:38,450 --> 02:42:40,350
Please tell me more of your secrets.

2917
02:42:40,790 --> 02:42:45,870
How much do you want from- Can I ask you to humor me?

2918
02:42:46,250 --> 02:42:49,430
I- I literally just talked to you.

2919
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:51,070
Oh my god.

2920
02:42:52,470 --> 02:42:56,690
We- we just talked, like, five minutes ago.

2921
02:42:57,310 --> 02:43:02,370
I'd like for you to teach me more secrets about building weaponry.

2922
02:43:02,710 --> 02:43:08,790
You're the only one I can ask for this, and there are a lot of other things I'd like to do with this.

2923
02:43:09,230 --> 02:43:15,630
You will not be possible until we meet in person, so as soon as you're ready, I'll come to your room.

2924
02:43:15,890 --> 02:43:17,930
I'm sure that this will be-

2925
02:43:21,650 --> 02:43:22,930
I need to use the bathroom.

2926
02:43:23,130 --> 02:43:24,070
I'll be right back.

2927
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:18,420
I need to refill my water.

2928
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:21,520
I need to hydrate before she shows up to my room.

2929
02:44:55,030 --> 02:44:55,590
Alright.

2930
02:44:56,430 --> 02:44:58,050
Alright, I have more water.

2931
02:44:58,770 --> 02:45:00,570
I gotta make sure I'm hydrated.

2932
02:45:03,150 --> 02:45:05,270
Before she shows up.

2933
02:45:05,270 --> 02:45:06,690
I got it.

2934
02:45:07,810 --> 02:45:10,810
Oh man, SimpleMind, thank you for the super chat.

2935
02:45:10,910 --> 02:45:11,730
Thank you, thank you.

2936
02:45:11,770 --> 02:45:14,550
How many times has DookieRit laughed this stream?

2937
02:45:14,630 --> 02:45:15,490
I just got here.

2938
02:45:16,430 --> 02:45:17,930
DarkFlame, thank you for the super chat.

2939
02:45:18,030 --> 02:45:18,790
Thank you, thank you.

2940
02:45:19,110 --> 02:45:22,570
Her first mistake was not putting a copyright on her robot concept.

2941
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:25,470
I'm just saying, did the robot not do enough?

2942
02:45:25,470 --> 02:45:29,270
You literally have a life-size, very accurate robot of me.

2943
02:45:29,530 --> 02:45:32,210
And now she's gonna show up in my room, guys.

2944
02:45:32,890 --> 02:45:34,130
I have something to tell you about.

2945
02:45:34,230 --> 02:45:35,170
It's about Arbor Green.

2946
02:45:35,350 --> 02:45:36,890
The plant I had you find me the other day.

2947
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:38,810
It actually has some rather rare benefits.

2948
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:46,250
According to the warish raving, it can improve one's powers of observation, insight for a time, and this in turn leads to enhancement of the effects of training.

2949
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:51,090
Apparently, you can even buy some of them these days if you can afford the high price.

2950
02:45:51,350 --> 02:45:52,770
So how about giving it a try?

2951
02:45:52,890 --> 02:45:53,930
No, I'll still forage.

2952
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:56,810
Oh my god.

2953
02:45:57,690 --> 02:46:00,670
The fact that she was like, I'm gonna show up in your room.

2954
02:46:00,670 --> 02:46:02,930
And we're gonna make some memories.

2955
02:46:05,150 --> 02:46:06,670
Holy shit.

2956
02:46:07,490 --> 02:46:09,710
I was not ready for that.

2957
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:16,550
I was not ready for that at all.

2958
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:25,080
No, your active eyes will affect... I'll just make one then.

2959
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:26,440
There we go.

2960
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:30,260
Alright, where is she?

2961
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:33,140
Oh sorry, I forgot.

2962
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:34,320
Where is she?

2963
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:36,060
Wait, where is she?

2964
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:38,200
She said she'll show up in my room.

2965
02:46:41,220 --> 02:46:42,060
Where is she?

2966
02:46:44,420 --> 02:46:44,900
This?

2967
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:47,160
No, that's moon grass.

2968
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:48,520
Where is she?

2969
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:49,860
She said she'll show up.

2970
02:46:49,900 --> 02:46:50,480
I'm scared.

2971
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:56,660
She said she'll show up in my room.

2972
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:57,800
Oh, she's over here.

2973
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:00,200
Okay, that's not where I live, but that's okay.

2974
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:02,940
There she is.

2975
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:05,200
Alright.

2976
02:47:16,460 --> 02:47:17,020
Hello.

2977
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:27,820
Guys, don't.

2978
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:29,560
It's a long con, guys.

2979
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:32,060
I'll be the only one in her mind.

2980
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:36,020
And then Jugodlan will be mine.

2981
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:38,420
Are you feeling okay?

2982
02:47:58,720 --> 02:48:00,120
What is it?

2983
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:06,640
What is it?

2984
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:08,120
That's good.

2985
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:10,080
Guys, that's good.

2986
02:48:10,360 --> 02:48:12,860
I hope you stay there for the rest of your life.

2987
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:18,920
She needs to stay there for the rest of her life and she'll never meet him.

2988
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:20,200
That's good!

2989
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:22,100
Let's go!

2990
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:29,140
It's all coming together.

2991
02:48:32,060 --> 02:48:33,020
You understand me.

2992
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:39,400
You taught me about so many things that I never knew existed.

2993
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:45,260
Not just weapons, but also feelings.

2994
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:45,900
What?

2995
02:48:47,790 --> 02:48:48,440
I'm sorry.

2996
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:51,300
I know I shouldn't be saying this out loud.

2997
02:48:52,380 --> 02:49:00,420
Actually, once I returned home, I was thinking about channeling these emotions to start my work on that thing we talked about.

2998
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,420
Wait, which one?

2999
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:02,520
There were many things.

3000
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:05,920
Which one?

3001
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:08,720
You wanted to create a lot of things.

3002
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:35,600
I promised to show you the greatest replica of yourself that you've ever seen.

3003
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:38,960
You make us laugh.

3004
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:40,460
I love you.

3005
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:42,460
Oh my god.

3006
02:49:42,460 --> 02:49:45,040
I look forward to it.

3007
02:49:45,100 --> 02:49:48,720
And I'm passionate as always.

3008
02:49:49,460 --> 02:49:56,720
Oh, she's the most accurate doll I've ever seen.

3009
02:49:57,400 --> 02:50:00,880
I don't even know what to say.

3010
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:02,960
What do I say to that?

3011
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:09,800
Passionate as always.

3012
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:13,460
Oh my god.

3013
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:16,740
I don't think this was in history.

3014
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:25,000
I did it.

3015
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:27,300
I did it.

3016
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:33,020
Jukka who to her?

3017
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:35,940
She won't have him in here.

3018
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:37,980
Wait, she's getting closer.

3019
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:45,140
I did it, guys.

3020
02:50:45,380 --> 02:50:47,200
They won't get married now.

3021
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:48,620
I did it, everyone.

3022
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:51,120
I've completed my mission.

3023
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:53,540
I've denied their marriage.

3024
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:55,140
I've changed the fate.

3025
02:50:58,500 --> 02:50:59,960
I've changed fate.

3026
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:02,540
This was all worth it, guys.

3027
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,680
It was all worth it.

3028
02:51:04,940 --> 02:51:06,780
I've changed fate.

3029
02:51:10,860 --> 02:51:11,600
Thank you.

3030
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:12,860
Thank you for the super chat.

3031
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:13,300
Thank you.

3032
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:13,900
Thank you.

3033
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:20,160
You know, YuYan might have built life-sized doll of you, but at least she didn't spend trillions on a home sub.

3034
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:22,020
That's different.

3035
02:51:22,760 --> 02:51:24,100
That's different.

3036
02:51:24,100 --> 02:51:28,960
She literally invented the world's first sex doll.

3037
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:34,300
Because she was that desperate.

3038
02:51:37,480 --> 02:51:40,140
Alan, Nepper, Salad, thank you for the super chat.

3039
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:40,620
Thank you.

3040
02:51:40,680 --> 02:51:41,440
Thank you.

3041
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:47,100
According to... The Host Club is a good investment, guys.

3042
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:55,840
According to the tutorial, to eliminate Yuan Shu...

3043
02:51:55,840 --> 02:52:02,240
We were supposed to advance our forces to attack his headquarters, but the situation has changed.

3044
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:03,380
Yuan Shu's force...

3045
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:08,600
I like... I'm fucking sure that has to be made up for this game.

3046
02:52:08,820 --> 02:52:14,660
Like, YuYan did not make a fucking life-sized Acura doll of a person.

3047
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:16,420
I refuse to believe it.

3048
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:20,900
I refuse to believe she actually did this.

3049
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:27,120
The enemy is led by Li Qian.

3050
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:29,660
We fought him both in Xiao Pei.

3051
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:33,960
Let's make sure we drive him right back, just like last time.

3052
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:37,940
Let me remind you that we'll be commanding our forces in this fight.

3053
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:41,040
As always, I'll need your protection to make sure that I'm not defeated.

3054
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:44,820
Our vast... The enemy outnumbered us greatly, but when do they not?

3055
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:47,380
It is actually rather fortunate that we're now on the defensive.

3056
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:50,000
Let's use our positioning to overcome their advantage.

3057
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:58,220
We'll have no trouble riding them in confusion, but to make this work, they may need to be lured north and south.

3058
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:01,300
A strong central defense should be our first priority.

3059
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:04,180
We have to make them believe they won't get through easily.

3060
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:06,320
Alright.

3061
02:53:08,100 --> 02:53:10,340
They don't have to... We won't let you down.

3062
02:53:11,360 --> 02:53:15,180
Every time a fight comes my way, I rely on my companions to get through it.

3063
02:53:15,620 --> 02:53:19,040
Having all of you with me is what makes me believe I can win.

3064
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:22,740
It is honored to have each of you by my side.

3065
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:23,660
Alright, I'm ready.

3066
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:26,260
We don't even need to use the traps.

3067
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:28,000
I'm going straight in.

3068
02:53:31,140 --> 02:53:31,620
Alright.

3069
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:33,500
I'm going straight in.

3070
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:34,240
Let's go.

3071
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:40,640
Get over here!

3072
02:53:40,940 --> 02:53:41,960
Get over here!

3073
02:53:44,980 --> 02:53:48,460
As long as you... As long as, like, you know...

3074
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:58,280
Aw man, if Yuya and Jugo then actually get together and then they use my fucking very accurate doll in their freaky adventures, I don't know how I'll feel.

3075
02:53:58,280 --> 02:54:01,880
They'll be like, guys, we need to spice up this marriage.

3076
02:54:02,060 --> 02:54:03,520
And then she brings out the doll.

3077
02:54:15,320 --> 02:54:18,440
Also, after this battle, guys, I gotta walk dad.

3078
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:21,660
I gotta do, like, a dad walk after this.

3079
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:24,720
Alright, nice.

3080
02:54:25,580 --> 02:54:27,220
Let me just kill all of these guys real quick.

3081
02:54:27,220 --> 02:54:29,220
I gotta let off some steam.

3082
02:54:31,280 --> 02:54:33,620
Please, keep me back in the battlefield.

3083
02:54:34,180 --> 02:54:39,540
I don't...

3084
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:41,340
He's like, walkies!

3085
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:42,840
What the fuck?

3086
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:45,460
Why is this fucking nerd doing so much to me?

3087
02:54:46,580 --> 02:54:47,800
Get out of here!

3088
02:54:49,640 --> 02:54:54,460
I've been... I've been risking so much that my body doesn't remember how to fight.

3089
02:54:57,220 --> 02:54:59,440
I've been too busy risking.

3090
02:55:00,520 --> 02:55:02,640
I forgot how to fight.

3091
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:05,200
My body is so tired.

3092
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:10,600
My body is so tired.

3093
02:55:11,100 --> 02:55:12,860
You don't understand.

3094
02:55:15,580 --> 02:55:18,840
Alright, we got rid of him.

3095
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:21,300
Oh wait, there's more?

3096
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:25,280
Alright, I'll get rid of him.

3097
02:55:27,220 --> 02:55:27,840
Alright, nice.

3098
02:55:31,280 --> 02:55:32,360
An opening!

3099
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:33,720
There's so many openings!

3100
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:38,320
I'm just very dehydrated right now.

3101
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:42,300
What do I do now?

3102
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:42,980
I did it.

3103
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:45,620
Wait, what do I do now?

3104
02:55:46,460 --> 02:55:47,140
Wait, what?

3105
02:55:47,820 --> 02:55:48,900
Who did he kill?

3106
02:55:52,840 --> 02:55:56,400
Oh, I should get this guy.

3107
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:02,340
Okay, this way.

3108
02:56:03,340 --> 02:56:04,600
Oh wait, the trap!

3109
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:06,460
Okay, yeah, I should let them do the trap thing.

3110
02:56:12,140 --> 02:56:13,240
Wait, where is he?

3111
02:56:14,300 --> 02:56:16,500
Alright, I'll let them do the trap first.

3112
02:56:19,340 --> 02:56:21,000
But I'll kill him first.

3113
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:24,440
It'll be fine.

3114
02:56:27,380 --> 02:56:28,260
What do we do?

3115
02:56:30,460 --> 02:56:31,300
Alright, nice.

3116
02:56:34,520 --> 02:56:36,240
Okay, now I go back to F.

3117
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:38,620
Don't worry!

3118
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,120
They can't activate the traps if I kill all of them!

3119
02:56:43,700 --> 02:56:44,440
Get over here!

3120
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:48,380
Wait, reinforcements?

3121
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,220
Wait, excuse me?

3122
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:52,240
What do you mean reinforcements?

3123
02:56:52,340 --> 02:56:53,200
Alright, give me a sec.

3124
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:53,840
I'll come over.

3125
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:01,500
Alright, nice.

3126
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:03,040
Oh shit!

3127
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:05,360
What?!

3128
02:57:05,360 --> 02:57:06,600
I stopped you!

3129
02:57:08,180 --> 02:57:09,180
Oh shit!

3130
02:57:10,060 --> 02:57:10,340
Alright.

3131
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:12,220
Wait, they're advancing towards me?!

3132
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:14,800
Oh, they're scared.

3133
02:57:16,320 --> 02:57:17,700
They're so scared.

3134
02:57:17,940 --> 02:57:20,680
Oh my god, the guard has fled?!

3135
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:22,180
Who fled?!

3136
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:24,220
What do you mean you guys fled?!

3137
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:28,220
How did you guys leave?!

3138
02:57:31,660 --> 02:57:34,220
What do you mean you guys left?!

3139
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:37,920
Guys, we're still fighting!

3140
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:41,660
The fight literally just started!

3141
02:57:41,880 --> 02:57:43,060
You can't just leave!

3142
02:57:45,400 --> 02:57:46,540
I left.

3143
02:57:46,880 --> 02:57:48,680
You can't do anything about it.

3144
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:51,920
Alright, we got rid of him.

3145
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:55,280
I was gonna say, we literally just started!

3146
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:59,060
Okay.

3147
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:02,040
Alright, CHARGE!

3148
02:58:05,500 --> 02:58:06,460
Are you kidding?

3149
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:08,220
Does he want to challenge me?

3150
02:58:09,220 --> 02:58:10,280
Wait, who is he?

3151
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:12,140
Am I supposed to know who you are?

3152
02:58:14,140 --> 02:58:16,920
I was like, who is he?

3153
02:58:19,220 --> 02:58:20,960
I don't even know who you are!

3154
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:25,100
Alright, get over here.

3155
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:28,220
I don't know who you are, but I'll still kick your ass.

3156
02:58:29,180 --> 02:58:31,100
Wait, is this the commander?!

3157
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:32,040
Oh my god, already?!

3158
02:58:34,780 --> 02:58:36,480
Alright, we'll get rid of you now.

3159
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:38,360
Oh wait, you are!

3160
02:58:38,500 --> 02:58:38,800
Okay.

3161
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:40,340
Good, you came to me.

3162
02:58:40,620 --> 02:58:41,140
That's good.

3163
02:58:41,960 --> 02:58:42,920
I don't have to like...

3164
02:58:44,740 --> 02:58:46,300
I don't have to travel to you.

3165
02:58:50,350 --> 02:58:52,830
Get over here so I can go back to my real game.

3166
02:58:54,310 --> 02:58:55,030
HAHAHA!

3167
02:58:55,890 --> 02:58:59,470
Let me kill you so I can go back to the actual game.

3168
02:58:59,890 --> 02:59:00,670
My Ryuzing.

3169
02:59:03,630 --> 02:59:04,750
Alright, nice.

3170
02:59:07,170 --> 02:59:07,890
Alright.

3171
02:59:09,370 --> 02:59:10,210
He's like halfway.

3172
02:59:10,930 --> 02:59:13,630
Jesus Christ, you have so much HP.

3173
02:59:14,270 --> 02:59:16,170
Oh my god!

3174
02:59:16,490 --> 02:59:17,990
How do you still...

3175
02:59:17,990 --> 02:59:19,250
I'm only halfway!

3176
02:59:22,370 --> 02:59:23,350
Alright, nice.

3177
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:26,410
I'm just gonna...

3178
02:59:26,410 --> 02:59:27,030
Alright.

3179
02:59:27,510 --> 02:59:28,110
Encouragement!

3180
02:59:28,750 --> 02:59:29,310
Go!

3181
02:59:29,530 --> 02:59:30,670
Cheer them on!

3182
02:59:33,750 --> 02:59:34,350
Alright.

3183
02:59:38,280 --> 02:59:38,880
Spin!

3184
02:59:41,240 --> 02:59:41,840
Spin!

3185
02:59:44,320 --> 02:59:45,520
Retaining game.

3186
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:50,840
All I'm saying is I need to kill him so I can go back to what really matters.

3187
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:51,660
In this game.

3188
02:59:52,620 --> 02:59:53,300
The Ryuz.

3189
02:59:55,460 --> 02:59:55,800
Okay.

3190
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:57,320
Jesus Christ.

3191
02:59:57,920 --> 02:59:58,900
What is he doing?

3192
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:01,320
Why is he sending bubbles out?

3193
03:00:01,780 --> 03:00:02,480
HAHAHA!

3194
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:05,240
What do the bubbles mean?

3195
03:00:05,660 --> 03:00:06,960
What do the bubbles mean?!

3196
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:08,460
Oh my god.

3197
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:11,760
Oh shit.

3198
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:13,660
OH FUCK!

3199
03:00:13,940 --> 03:00:14,660
OH GOD!

3200
03:00:14,660 --> 03:00:16,820
OH SHIT!

3201
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:18,240
OH SHIT!

3202
03:00:20,980 --> 03:00:23,600
Okay, that's what the bubble means guys.

3203
03:00:23,920 --> 03:00:28,020
That's what they mean, I just realized.

3204
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:31,120
He's literally what...

3205
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:34,760
I was like, what do they mean?

3206
03:00:36,820 --> 03:00:39,920
Wait, he wasn't the boss?

3207
03:00:44,700 --> 03:00:46,840
Wait, he wasn't the end game?

3208
03:00:47,320 --> 03:00:49,420
Oh my god, why do they all have so much HP?

3209
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:56,340
Guan Yu.

3210
03:00:56,560 --> 03:00:57,680
Guan Yu, I'm not okay.

3211
03:00:58,160 --> 03:00:59,900
Guan Yu, I'm not okay.

3212
03:01:04,340 --> 03:01:05,140
I missed.

3213
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:06,300
I missed!

3214
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:07,160
I missed!

3215
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:07,700
I missed!

3216
03:01:07,820 --> 03:01:08,260
I missed!

3217
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:08,600
I missed!

3218
03:01:11,140 --> 03:01:12,520
Oh my god.

3219
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:13,480
Guys.

3220
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:16,920

3224
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:20,880
I'M NOT OKAY!

3225
03:01:22,340 --> 03:01:24,960
Oh my god, where's... where's the house?

3226
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:26,360
Where's the house?

3227
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:27,560
I'm 1 HP.

3228
03:01:27,860 --> 03:01:28,620
I need buns.

3229
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:30,600
I need buns real quick guys.

3230
03:01:31,340 --> 03:01:33,540
Oh, where's the buns at?

3231
03:01:36,140 --> 03:01:37,660
Oh my god, okay.

3232
03:01:39,540 --> 03:01:40,580
Snack break.

3233
03:01:41,100 --> 03:01:42,480
Give me a sec.

3234
03:01:43,020 --> 03:01:44,120
Snack break.

3235
03:01:45,860 --> 03:01:46,340
Okay.

3236
03:01:46,340 --> 03:01:47,340
Okay, I'm ready.

3237
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:47,820
I'm ready.

3238
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:48,320
I'm ready.

3239
03:01:48,460 --> 03:01:49,100
I'm ready.

3240
03:01:49,540 --> 03:01:51,580
I'm ready for the actual fight.

3241
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:55,700
It's okay, I'm okay now.

3242
03:01:56,320 --> 03:01:58,000
I got my snacky break.

3243
03:02:02,180 --> 03:02:05,620
Oh my god, who the fuck did I fight that did so much?

3244
03:02:09,320 --> 03:02:09,800
Okay.

3245
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:10,800
Okay.

3246
03:02:12,420 --> 03:02:13,260
Okay.

3247
03:02:14,060 --> 03:02:14,560
We're fine.

3248
03:02:15,480 --> 03:02:17,080
Round 2.

3249
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:22,320
Jesus Christ.

3250
03:02:23,800 --> 03:02:24,260
Nice.

3251
03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:27,200
Alright.

3252
03:02:28,760 --> 03:02:29,300
We did it.

3253
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:32,320
Okay, we gotta go home now.

3254
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:43,680
Oh shit!

3255
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:46,100
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

3256
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:48,280
Let me kill this one random guy first.

3257
03:02:50,520 --> 03:02:51,620
Liu Bei will be fine.

3258
03:02:51,900 --> 03:02:52,520
He'll live.

3259
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:52,960
He'll live.

3260
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:53,440
He'll live.

3261
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:54,160
He'll live.

3262
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:55,340
Don't worry, I'll be there soon.

3263
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:56,100
He'll live.

3264
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:57,420
I just need to kill this one guy.

3265
03:02:57,500 --> 03:02:58,080
I need the XP.

3266
03:03:00,820 --> 03:03:02,080
Guys, don't worry.

3267
03:03:02,480 --> 03:03:03,040
He'll live.

3268
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:04,320
Oh my god.

3269
03:03:04,420 --> 03:03:05,960
Liu Bei, please just live for one second.

3270
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:06,380
Please.

3271
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:07,100
Liu Bei.

3272
03:03:07,340 --> 03:03:08,560
Liu Bei, live for one second.

3273
03:03:08,660 --> 03:03:09,380
Okay, I'm coming over.

3274
03:03:09,480 --> 03:03:09,880
I'm coming over.

3275
03:03:09,980 --> 03:03:10,440
I'm coming over.

3276
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:10,980
I'm coming over.

3277
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:11,560
I'm coming over.

3278
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:12,740
I'm coming over.

3279
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:13,360
I'm coming over.

3280
03:03:13,460 --> 03:03:13,920
I'm coming over.

3281
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:14,800
Liu Bei, please.

3282
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:15,940
Please do a level guide.

3283
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:16,200
Please.

3284
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:18,320
He didn't realize we were there.

3285
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:22,200
Oh my god.

3286
03:03:26,860 --> 03:03:28,860
He is so weak.

3287
03:03:30,040 --> 03:03:32,000
You were at half HP.

3288
03:03:33,560 --> 03:03:34,160
Okay.

3289
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:36,480
Okay, guys.

3290
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:38,720
He was half HP, guys.

3291
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:42,540
Oh, shit.

3292
03:03:42,940 --> 03:03:43,720
Oh, fuck.

3293
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:44,760
Okay, give me a sec.

3294
03:03:44,840 --> 03:03:46,420
I need to get my buttons again.

3295
03:03:46,940 --> 03:03:47,720
Snacky break.

3296
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:49,880
Guys, snack break.

3297
03:03:50,180 --> 03:03:51,020
Give me a sec.

3298
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:54,320
It's snacky break right now.

3299
03:03:54,320 --> 03:03:54,660
Wow.

3300
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:57,340
Okay.

3301
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:03,320
Okay, I'm grabbing my snack break and then...

3302
03:04:04,580 --> 03:04:09,100
I'll kill him and then I'll go straight... Okay, I learned my lesson, guys.

3303
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:13,240
I learned my lesson this time.

3304
03:04:14,560 --> 03:04:16,680
I learned my lesson.

3305
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:20,320
Okay.

3306
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:23,300
This time, I got it.

3307
03:04:24,320 --> 03:04:26,300
I just kill him and then it'll be fine.

3308
03:04:27,020 --> 03:04:28,840
Snack break, take 3.

3309
03:04:29,580 --> 03:04:30,360
Don't worry.

3310
03:04:30,800 --> 03:04:31,660
It'll be fine.

3311
03:04:35,440 --> 03:04:36,200
Don't worry.

3312
03:04:36,380 --> 03:04:37,240
It'll be fine.

3313
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:39,940
Okay.

3314
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:41,720
We're almost done.

3315
03:04:41,780 --> 03:04:42,520
We're almost done.

3316
03:04:42,780 --> 03:04:43,320
Don't worry.

3317
03:04:43,420 --> 03:04:44,360
We're almost done.

3318
03:04:46,340 --> 03:04:48,160
Please, do not die.

3319
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:51,060
I'm almost done, Liu Bei!

3320
03:04:55,980 --> 03:04:57,200
Okay, he's dead.

3321
03:04:58,040 --> 03:04:59,160
He's dead, okay.

3322
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:00,660
I'm coming over.

3323
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:01,420
I'm coming over.

3324
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:02,260
I'm coming over.

3325
03:05:06,240 --> 03:05:07,940
Please, I swear to God.

3326
03:05:10,780 --> 03:05:11,840
I'm skipping him.

3327
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:13,020
I'm skipping him this time.

3328
03:05:13,400 --> 03:05:15,080
Are you serious?

3329
03:05:15,260 --> 03:05:16,060
Are you half HP?

3330
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:20,220
How are you half HP?

3331
03:05:20,540 --> 03:05:22,560
Liu Bei, I swear to God, I can't get to you.

3332
03:05:22,560 --> 03:05:23,760
Liu Bei, I swear!

3333
03:05:26,900 --> 03:05:31,720
I swear to God, I couldn't even get to him.

3334
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:33,860
So, like, give me a sec.

3335
03:05:38,240 --> 03:05:38,880
Okay.

3336
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:43,900
Like, I am trying my best.

3337
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:48,220
I am trying my best right now.

3338
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:52,380
Liu Bei, I don't understand.

3339
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:55,200
How are you so weak?

3340
03:05:55,940 --> 03:05:58,500
I don't understand.

3341
03:06:01,320 --> 03:06:03,320
Oh my God.

3342
03:06:03,540 --> 03:06:05,280
How is he so weak?

3343
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:08,240
How is my buddy so fucking weak?

3344
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:11,440
Jesus Christ.

3345
03:06:11,440 --> 03:06:13,380
I'm doing everything I can.

3346
03:06:13,580 --> 03:06:16,380
I'm doing everything I can right now.

3347
03:06:16,380 --> 03:06:18,360
To make sure he lives.

3348
03:06:21,480 --> 03:06:23,260
He's just so weak.

3349
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:27,440
Oh my God, they're all too far from me.

3350
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:29,400
A breakdance.

3351
03:06:30,600 --> 03:06:32,160
He's just a ball.

3352
03:06:32,440 --> 03:06:32,960
What?

3353
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:34,160
How?

3354
03:06:34,420 --> 03:06:36,120
How do I save you?

3355
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:42,560
Why are you so weak?

3356
03:06:43,460 --> 03:06:45,360
Oh my God.

3357
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:47,380
Okay.

3358
03:06:47,700 --> 03:06:49,080
Oh my God.

3359
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:49,420
Okay.

3360
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:50,960
Snacky break, take two.

3361
03:06:51,420 --> 03:06:53,200
Snacky break, take two.

3362
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:54,420
I died.

3363
03:06:54,820 --> 03:06:57,440
I couldn't even get my snack break.

3364
03:06:58,120 --> 03:07:04,780
I couldn't even get my food break.

3365
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:07,380
Oh my God.

3366
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:07,660
Alright.

3367
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:09,640
Alright, here we go again.

3368
03:07:11,180 --> 03:07:11,800
Fun break.

3369
03:07:14,380 --> 03:07:16,140
Break for my buns.

3370
03:07:16,900 --> 03:07:18,080
Right here.

3371
03:07:19,720 --> 03:07:21,640
Okay, we're not doing XP anymore.

3372
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:23,420
We're going straight to save it.

3373
03:07:23,460 --> 03:07:25,700
Making sure Lupe does not get involved.

3374
03:07:26,760 --> 03:07:27,080
Alright.

3375
03:07:28,360 --> 03:07:29,900
Okay, I just need to block him.

3376
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:32,620
As long as he...

3377
03:07:34,440 --> 03:07:35,040
Alright.

3378
03:07:36,260 --> 03:07:37,220
Look at me.

3379
03:07:37,400 --> 03:07:38,380
Don't go over.

3380
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:39,920
Just come to me.

3381
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:41,040
There we go.

3382
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:41,900
There we go.

3383
03:07:41,980 --> 03:07:42,960
As long...

3384
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:43,960
There we go.

3385
03:07:45,580 --> 03:07:46,180
He doesn't...

3386
03:07:46,180 --> 03:07:47,200
Okay, there we go.

3387
03:07:47,240 --> 03:07:47,960
We can do this.

3388
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:50,120
There we go.

3389
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:54,920
As long as he doesn't go to Lupe, it should be fine.

3390
03:07:55,220 --> 03:07:57,380
It should be fine.

3391
03:07:59,440 --> 03:08:00,020
What?

3392
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:02,040
This is the only way.

3393
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:04,240
It's okay.

3394
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:05,260
It's okay.

3395
03:08:05,580 --> 03:08:09,040
I've distracted them from going into the actual fight.

3396
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:11,620
It's fine.

3397
03:08:16,360 --> 03:08:17,920
Jesus Christ.

3398
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:21,080
I don't know what's going on.

3399
03:08:23,320 --> 03:08:24,920
Just don't go there.

3400
03:08:27,750 --> 03:08:28,140
Okay.

3401
03:08:28,620 --> 03:08:29,080
It's fine.

3402
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:31,760
I'm like somewhere in here.

3403
03:08:32,180 --> 03:08:34,260
I don't...

3404
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:36,060
Holy shit.

3405
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:39,120
Like, what do I do?

3406
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:41,560
Please.

3407
03:08:43,420 --> 03:08:44,440
Oh, no.

3408
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:45,440
Oh, no.

3409
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:45,740
Please.

3410
03:08:46,320 --> 03:08:46,600
Please.

3411
03:08:46,700 --> 03:08:48,300
I just need one Musou.

3412
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:50,340
Nice.

3413
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:51,920
It's rage time.

3414
03:08:53,540 --> 03:08:55,940
You shall not pass.

3415
03:08:56,700 --> 03:08:57,340
It's okay.

3416
03:08:57,620 --> 03:08:58,720
It's rage mode.

3417
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:02,040
As long as I keep hitting...

3418
03:09:05,140 --> 03:09:07,160
I can get my HP back with this.

3419
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:11,700
I can get my HP back.

3420
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:14,180
I'll kill this random general.

3421
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:16,820
It's okay.

3422
03:09:16,820 --> 03:09:17,820
I'm getting it back.

3423
03:09:21,340 --> 03:09:27,480
It might have been a waste of my rage, but like, I need anything I can get right now.

3424
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:29,220
Oh, my God.

3425
03:09:31,480 --> 03:09:32,300
Alright, nice.

3426
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:34,280
Alright, I killed one.

3427
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:36,640
I got a little bit of it back, guys.

3428
03:09:37,380 --> 03:09:40,480
I figured it out.

3429
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:43,300
Okay, nice.

3430
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:48,020
Alright, use your move.

3431
03:09:50,140 --> 03:09:50,680
Please.

3432
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:52,820
I'm almost close to beating Guan Yu.

3433
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:56,660
Oh, my God.

3434
03:09:57,720 --> 03:09:58,360
Please.

3435
03:09:59,580 --> 03:10:00,340
Oh, my God.

3436
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:01,000
Please.

3437
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:02,680
Ah!

3438
03:10:03,480 --> 03:10:03,820
Ah!

3439
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:06,480
Oh, my God.

3440
03:10:06,480 --> 03:10:06,600
Oh, my God.

3441
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:07,040
I'm full HP.

3442
03:10:07,580 --> 03:10:08,180
Oh, my God.

3443
03:10:08,220 --> 03:10:08,800
It's possible.

3444
03:10:09,380 --> 03:10:10,680
It's actually possible.

3445
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:11,800
Oh, God.

3446
03:10:13,260 --> 03:10:14,240
Oh, my God.

3447
03:10:14,280 --> 03:10:14,820
I dodged.

3448
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:18,900
Nice.

3449
03:10:19,420 --> 03:10:19,860
Cancel.

3450
03:10:23,260 --> 03:10:23,680
It's fine.

3451
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:24,000
See?

3452
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:24,600
I did it.

3453
03:10:24,920 --> 03:10:25,760
I did it.

3454
03:10:25,800 --> 03:10:27,640
I just need to make sure they don't touch Liu Bei.

3455
03:10:28,220 --> 03:10:29,460
And it'll be fine.

3456
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:32,540
Alright, nice.

3457
03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:33,520
Do the twirl.

3458
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:40,040
Guys, I think I need more money so I can actually buy a weapon.

3459
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:47,640
My lack of money is actually fucking me over.

3460
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:51,560
I should have not went to so many host clubs, guys.

3461
03:10:53,480 --> 03:10:55,860
Like, I think it actually is fucking me over.

3462
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:00,800
Alright, nice.

3463
03:11:02,620 --> 03:11:02,880
Alright.

3464
03:11:03,820 --> 03:11:04,380
Please.

3465
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:05,980
I can almost become Guan Yin.

3466
03:11:06,180 --> 03:11:07,180
I'm so close.

3467
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:09,580
Jesus Christ.

3468
03:11:09,700 --> 03:11:09,900
Okay.

3469
03:11:10,520 --> 03:11:11,660
Gotta do the twirl.

3470
03:11:13,380 --> 03:11:13,980
Where is he?

3471
03:11:16,920 --> 03:11:17,480
Nice.

3472
03:11:17,680 --> 03:11:18,840
He's so close to dying.

3473
03:11:20,940 --> 03:11:22,020
God damn it.

3474
03:11:22,260 --> 03:11:23,860
All my guards are dead.

3475
03:11:26,660 --> 03:11:26,940
Nice.

3476
03:11:27,500 --> 03:11:27,780
Counter!

3477
03:11:30,440 --> 03:11:31,340
He's 1 HP.

3478
03:11:31,340 --> 03:11:32,000
He's 1 HP.

3479
03:11:32,180 --> 03:11:32,820
Yeah!

3480
03:11:34,560 --> 03:11:35,820
We did it!

3481
03:11:36,720 --> 03:11:38,960
You're just building carry.

3482
03:11:39,820 --> 03:11:42,320
All that risk and no power.

3483
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:45,740
We did it!

3484
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:46,920
Woo!

3485
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:50,340
Ba da dum ba da da da da da!

3486
03:11:53,380 --> 03:11:56,440
Yeah, that was incredibly close, Liu Bei.

3487
03:11:56,920 --> 03:12:01,320
That was a little bit too close, Liu Bei.

3488
03:12:03,400 --> 03:12:05,400
Alright, nice.

3489
03:12:06,300 --> 03:12:07,200
Level 16.

3490
03:12:11,020 --> 03:12:12,100
Yay!

3491
03:12:13,300 --> 03:12:14,140
Yay!

3492
03:12:15,020 --> 03:12:15,260
Yay!

3493
03:12:22,770 --> 03:12:24,350
We did it!

3494
03:12:39,790 --> 03:12:43,130
I only regret that I could not slay Yuan Shu.

3495
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:46,110
He will not survive our next encounter.

3496
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:49,030
Just another raging victory for the Liu Bei army.

3497
03:12:49,750 --> 03:12:50,590
Just as planned.

3498
03:12:50,950 --> 03:12:53,270
Just Liu Bei almost dying yet again.

3499
03:12:56,030 --> 03:12:57,870
At least I haven't heard anything of concern.

3500
03:12:59,650 --> 03:13:00,170
Liu Bei!

3501
03:13:01,370 --> 03:13:01,610
Wait.

3502
03:13:02,290 --> 03:13:02,970
Is that...

3503
03:13:02,970 --> 03:13:04,490
Oh yeah, I forgot about the third brother.

3504
03:13:05,230 --> 03:13:06,250
Hey guys, remember Zhang Fei?

3505
03:13:06,850 --> 03:13:07,410
Zhang Fei?

3506
03:13:07,910 --> 03:13:08,950
What are you doing here?

3507
03:13:08,970 --> 03:13:11,130
Oh yeah, Lu Bu took over the castle.

3508
03:13:22,970 --> 03:13:24,790
We are drinking!

3509
03:13:25,310 --> 03:13:25,810
Zhang Fei!

3510
03:13:27,810 --> 03:13:28,570
I knew it.

3511
03:13:28,570 --> 03:13:36,050
I knew it.

3512
03:13:36,750 --> 03:13:39,610
That's why you should never leave a drunk to guard a castle.

3513
03:13:40,670 --> 03:13:42,490
You were told not to drink, bro!

3514
03:13:47,410 --> 03:13:49,310
Why were you drinking?!

3515
03:13:49,310 --> 03:13:51,290
That doesn't answer my question!

3516
03:13:58,570 --> 03:13:59,870
Classic Liu Bu.

3517
03:14:00,290 --> 03:14:01,170
Silly man.

3518
03:14:02,350 --> 03:14:03,710
Classic Liu Bu.

3519
03:14:04,490 --> 03:14:05,270
Little rascal.

3520
03:14:12,690 --> 03:14:18,650
Yeah, we lost like 80% of our army there.

3521
03:14:19,610 --> 03:14:22,090
With Liu Bei's brilliant plan.

3522
03:14:28,570 --> 03:14:29,910
I will be cruel to the people there.

3523
03:14:31,250 --> 03:14:33,970
Fighting him now gains us nothing.

3524
03:14:35,710 --> 03:14:36,230
But...

3525
03:14:37,090 --> 03:14:42,270
As much as I hate to admit it, losing Xiao Pei is something of a relief.

3526
03:14:43,250 --> 03:14:45,270
It's a weight off my shoulders.

3527
03:14:46,150 --> 03:14:51,730
Until now, I have forged my path with an unrelenting determination to help those in need.

3528
03:14:52,490 --> 03:14:53,690
Did I make the right choices?

3529
03:14:54,810 --> 03:14:55,830
Or have I gone astray?

3530
03:14:56,930 --> 03:15:00,710
What does it truly mean to make the world a better place?

3531
03:15:02,330 --> 03:15:04,010
I... still do not know.

3532
03:15:05,170 --> 03:15:05,650
But...

3533
03:15:05,650 --> 03:15:07,830
If there are answers to these questions...

3534
03:15:08,890 --> 03:15:11,910
Then perhaps I can find them within someone like Lord Liu Bu.

3535
03:15:13,050 --> 03:15:14,630
We should prepare to withdraw.

3536
03:15:17,090 --> 03:15:17,530
What do you mean?

3537
03:15:17,610 --> 03:15:19,330
Are we still gonna rely on him?

3538
03:15:19,470 --> 03:15:21,130
Bro, that guy just betrayed us!

3539
03:15:21,330 --> 03:15:23,170
What do you mean find answers with him?

3540
03:15:23,750 --> 03:15:25,470
It's all my fault.

3541
03:15:25,950 --> 03:15:30,330
If I hadn't lost control of the castle, he'd never be talking like this.

3542
03:15:30,430 --> 03:15:33,210
Oh no, he's going through a midlife crisis, guys.

3543
03:15:34,790 --> 03:15:37,310
Oh no, you broke him, Zhang Fei!

3544
03:15:37,510 --> 03:15:38,550
Look what you did!

3545
03:15:39,150 --> 03:15:40,410
You broke our brother!

3546
03:15:43,070 --> 03:15:44,650
Duck, thank you for the superchat.

3547
03:15:44,730 --> 03:15:45,750
Thank you, thank you.

3548
03:15:45,990 --> 03:15:48,290
She did, but it was broken within the first week.

3549
03:15:48,350 --> 03:15:50,170
Hence why no one remembered it.

3550
03:15:50,450 --> 03:15:52,210
Wait, how did she break the dog?

3551
03:15:54,390 --> 03:15:57,930
And moved his stronghold to Xiao Pi once more.

3552
03:16:01,370 --> 03:16:02,210
Alright.

3553
03:16:03,650 --> 03:16:05,030
He betrayed us.

3554
03:16:13,990 --> 03:16:16,510
Yes, this is your fault!

3555
03:16:16,830 --> 03:16:17,290
Yes!

3556
03:16:26,250 --> 03:16:27,630
You broke him!

3557
03:16:30,610 --> 03:16:31,830
Look what you did!

3558
03:16:31,890 --> 03:16:33,030
You broke that man!

3559
03:16:33,210 --> 03:16:34,370
He had nothing!

3560
03:16:48,050 --> 03:16:49,630
Yeah, we lost the entire castle.

3561
03:16:49,750 --> 03:16:52,290
He wasn't even drinking outside of town.

3562
03:16:52,290 --> 03:16:56,210
He was drinking in the castle and he still manages to lose the castle.

3563
03:16:57,390 --> 03:16:59,130
I'll go talk to him.

3564
03:17:02,150 --> 03:17:03,430
Yeah, I don't think

3565
03:17:06,620 --> 03:17:11,140
he wants to see you, Zhang Fei.

3566
03:17:16,200 --> 03:17:18,820
Oh no, he's drinking too.

3567
03:17:19,880 --> 03:17:22,260
He's drinking his sorrows away.

3568
03:17:23,500 --> 03:17:26,320
Oh no, he's at the pub.

3569
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:29,120
Alright, do I have enough yet?

3570
03:17:30,780 --> 03:17:31,660
Goddammit, okay.

3571
03:17:31,900 --> 03:17:33,680
Oh my god, Dragoon's Destiny.

3572
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:36,160
Oh my god, okay, I need to get this.

3573
03:17:38,900 --> 03:17:42,940
Oh my god, we're so close to being able to afford it!

3574
03:17:44,100 --> 03:17:45,460
Alright, let's sell this.

3575
03:17:50,130 --> 03:17:50,670
Alright,

3576
03:17:54,740 --> 03:17:55,580
we're so close.

3577
03:17:55,580 --> 03:17:57,220
We can almost afford it, guys.

3578
03:18:10,050 --> 03:18:12,190
We can afford it now!

3579
03:18:12,290 --> 03:18:12,610
Nice!

3580
03:18:13,430 --> 03:18:17,370
Alright, see guys, I don't only spend it on host clubs.

3581
03:18:21,370 --> 03:18:26,470
See guys, I spend it on real things too.

3582
03:18:28,510 --> 03:18:32,330
Oh my god, it's been so long, I finally got my ye olde super chat.

3583
03:19:11,690 --> 03:19:13,590
Thank you for the super chat!

3584
03:19:13,710 --> 03:19:14,850
Thank you, thank you!

3585
03:19:14,910 --> 03:19:16,250
I really appreciate it.

3586
03:19:16,850 --> 03:19:20,290
Wow, thank you so much, buddy.

3587
03:19:21,230 --> 03:19:22,150
Alright, so I'll light.

3588
03:19:24,750 --> 03:19:25,750
I'll do one.

3589
03:19:26,490 --> 03:19:29,370
Alright, let's see.

3590
03:19:29,470 --> 03:19:32,390
Alright guys, I'm gonna walk dad real quick, okay?

3591
03:19:33,130 --> 03:19:34,150
It's his walkie time.

3592
03:19:34,290 --> 03:19:38,690
And we are doing a long stream, so I have to use that time to walk him.

3593
03:19:40,330 --> 03:19:44,530
Alright, walking my dog.

3594
03:19:44,730 --> 03:19:46,290
Be right back.

3595
03:19:48,890 --> 03:19:50,810
Alright, here we go.

3596
03:19:52,150 --> 03:19:55,450
Here, you can watch my doctor doing doctor things.

3597
03:19:58,920 --> 03:20:01,310
Here we go, just walking my dog.

3598
03:20:01,370 --> 03:20:02,330
I'll be right back.

3599
03:20:04,250 --> 03:20:04,830
Alright,

3600
03:31:12,730 --> 03:31:14,090
I'm back guys.

3601
03:31:14,230 --> 03:31:15,370
I'm back from walkies.

3602
03:31:15,530 --> 03:31:17,930
I don't know how Doki and Badoge does it.

3603
03:31:18,270 --> 03:31:25,250
But every time, every time he knows it's like, I need to be like back in time.

3604
03:31:25,870 --> 03:31:28,670
He like, does long, he wants long walkies.

3605
03:31:28,670 --> 03:31:31,390
He's like, you think I'm just gonna poop once?

3606
03:31:31,970 --> 03:31:33,030
No, no, no, no.

3607
03:31:35,050 --> 03:31:37,230
This is gonna be a twofer.

3608
03:31:37,510 --> 03:31:41,350
And then he always does the thing where like, I walk away from the trash can.

3609
03:31:41,610 --> 03:31:44,690
And then he's like, you wanna walk back?

3610
03:31:46,910 --> 03:31:48,870
You want me to walk back?

3611
03:31:48,970 --> 03:31:51,590
You wanna walk back and throw away the second dump?

3612
03:31:53,890 --> 03:31:55,070
Alright, I already forgot.

3613
03:31:55,090 --> 03:31:58,430
Oh yeah, I had to talk to Lube real quick.

3614
03:31:58,430 --> 03:31:59,730
I gotta get him from the pub.

3615
03:32:00,130 --> 03:32:04,010
Alright Lupe, I'm gonna pick you up from the pub.

3616
03:32:04,650 --> 03:32:08,170
But before I do that, let me like, fix my weapon real quick.

3617
03:32:09,070 --> 03:32:10,750
Uh, where are the new ones?

3618
03:32:10,890 --> 03:32:12,190
I don't even fucking know.

3619
03:32:13,530 --> 03:32:15,170
Where are the new ones that I received?

3620
03:32:15,250 --> 03:32:16,330
A Tempest Dance?

3621
03:32:17,270 --> 03:32:17,750
Woah.

3622
03:32:18,590 --> 03:32:21,930
What the, what the fuck is this?

3623
03:32:22,290 --> 03:32:25,430
Like, what the, okay, so...

3624
03:32:26,550 --> 03:32:27,610
Which one denies?

3625
03:32:27,730 --> 03:32:29,430
I assume this one...

3626
03:32:30,110 --> 03:32:31,670
That prevents staggering when using.

3627
03:32:31,870 --> 03:32:33,890
Okay, um...

3628
03:32:33,890 --> 03:32:35,210
I don't know what to use.

3629
03:32:35,370 --> 03:32:37,090
All of these are fucking crazy.

3630
03:32:38,370 --> 03:32:40,090
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of that.

3631
03:32:40,170 --> 03:32:42,710
No, I'm gonna get rid of that and put in a Tempest Dance.

3632
03:32:42,730 --> 03:32:43,710
That's crazy.

3633
03:32:43,970 --> 03:32:45,850
I summon a fucking tornado.

3634
03:32:46,270 --> 03:32:47,590
I'm using that shit.

3635
03:32:50,370 --> 03:32:51,370
Alright, uh...

3636
03:32:51,370 --> 03:32:52,170
That shit, alright.

3637
03:32:52,510 --> 03:32:55,330
Lupe, your brothers want me to pick you up from the pub.

3638
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:02,800
Your brothers are worried.

3639
03:33:13,310 --> 03:33:14,330
Yeah, it's me.

3640
03:33:18,230 --> 03:33:21,390
He's at rock bottom.

3641
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:22,870
Oh no, don't worry.

3642
03:33:23,110 --> 03:33:23,490
Don't worry.

3643
03:33:23,590 --> 03:33:26,650
When your son is born, then we'll see rock bottom.

3644
03:33:32,990 --> 03:33:34,750
Indulge me and listen for a moment.

3645
03:33:35,450 --> 03:33:39,530
It feels like it's been a lifetime since I left Yo.

3646
03:33:40,670 --> 03:33:42,850
And yet it has passed in the blink of an eye.

3647
03:33:43,410 --> 03:33:48,710
I only picked up a weapon because I was tired of seeing the sadness...

3648
03:33:48,710 --> 03:33:48,910
There's more!

3649
03:33:49,230 --> 03:33:52,730
Don't worry, you can fall even down, like, you can fall even more.

3650
03:33:52,890 --> 03:33:53,570
Don't worry, buddy.

3651
03:33:54,010 --> 03:33:55,570
This is not your rock bottom.

3652
03:33:55,690 --> 03:33:57,990
Far higher than I could ever possibly deserve.

3653
03:33:58,970 --> 03:34:01,630
I said I wanted to accomplish great things.

3654
03:34:02,910 --> 03:34:07,490
But that doesn't mean I want to sit in a castle and look down on others.

3655
03:34:08,010 --> 03:34:11,770
If Lord Louie Boo will protect the people of Shrew...

3656
03:34:12,690 --> 03:34:14,470
Then that is good enough for me.

3657
03:34:17,570 --> 03:34:18,790
Are you sure?

3658
03:34:20,350 --> 03:34:22,650
Are you sure that's all you want?

3659
03:34:23,050 --> 03:34:26,730
Well, I think so, but...

3660
03:34:26,730 --> 03:34:29,090
Are you sure you want Lou Boo to be in charge?

3661
03:34:29,710 --> 03:34:32,190
The guy that's known for murdering people?

3662
03:34:37,770 --> 03:34:38,290
Yeah?

3663
03:34:42,290 --> 03:34:42,910
The murderer?

3664
03:34:51,610 --> 03:34:53,490
Bro, he's not as midlife crisis yet.

3665
03:34:53,530 --> 03:34:54,610
He still doesn't have a mustache.

3666
03:35:03,840 --> 03:35:04,700
Hello!

3667
03:35:09,900 --> 03:35:11,620
Recent defeat?

3668
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:12,780
I killed him!

3669
03:35:16,860 --> 03:35:17,720
What?!

3670
03:35:17,720 --> 03:35:24,260
Look, we might have lost 80% of our army, but I still killed him.

3671
03:35:32,120 --> 03:35:34,860
You stabbed us in the back!

3672
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:36,960
You were drinking!

3673
03:35:37,020 --> 03:35:41,100
So this time, why don't you do the fighting and leave the guard duty to us?

3674
03:35:43,200 --> 03:35:45,960
And now you taunt us with a promise of betrayal.

3675
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:50,440
Perhaps I should kill you all while I still have the chance.

3676
03:35:51,740 --> 03:35:54,140
You're welcome to try!

3677
03:35:54,900 --> 03:35:55,500
Stop!

3678
03:35:55,880 --> 03:35:57,440
This is complicated enough.

3679
03:35:58,360 --> 03:35:59,740
So what's the plan then?

3680
03:35:59,740 --> 03:36:02,700
You're just going to join forces with these traitors?

3681
03:36:03,660 --> 03:36:04,100
Calm down.

3682
03:36:04,760 --> 03:36:06,740
They are neither friends nor foes.

3683
03:36:07,580 --> 03:36:10,660
Lord Tao Qian has tasked us with the protection of Shu.

3684
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:16,780
And as long as Yuan Shu maintains his position at Shou Chun, Shu will be vulnerable to attack.

3685
03:36:17,520 --> 03:36:21,240
Therefore, I have decided that we will assist you in defeating his forces.

3686
03:36:21,880 --> 03:36:22,440
Brother!

3687
03:36:31,840 --> 03:36:33,240
I don't know.

3688
03:36:33,820 --> 03:36:40,880
I feel like every time we let him decide what to do with the army, it has not really gone well.

3689
03:36:41,140 --> 03:36:46,300
I just feel like maybe we should stop letting him decide what to do.

3690
03:36:47,240 --> 03:36:49,080
Someone should really stop him.

3691
03:36:49,400 --> 03:36:52,440
It's getting a bit of a problem now.

3692
03:36:56,960 --> 03:36:57,940
Alright, let's see.

3693
03:36:57,960 --> 03:36:59,640
Let's see if there's anybody at the...

3694
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:02,180
Let's see if there's anyone that requests me at the host club.

3695
03:37:03,060 --> 03:37:05,060
This is important, guys.

3696
03:37:06,760 --> 03:37:07,540
Oh, nobody.

3697
03:37:07,900 --> 03:37:08,240
Okay.

3698
03:37:08,620 --> 03:37:10,300
No one wants... Okay, that's okay.

3699
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:11,300
That's okay.

3700
03:37:11,700 --> 03:37:13,700
That gives me more time to save money.

3701
03:37:13,900 --> 03:37:14,480
That's okay.

3702
03:37:15,140 --> 03:37:15,660
That's okay.

3703
03:37:15,700 --> 03:37:17,460
I just wanted to save money anyway.

3704
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:21,760
It's okay, guys.

3705
03:37:21,920 --> 03:37:23,740
I wanted to save my money.

3706
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:27,540
Like, that's good.

3707
03:37:27,660 --> 03:37:28,240
That's good.

3708
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:29,320
That's good.

3709
03:37:29,860 --> 03:37:30,780
Guys, that's good.

3710
03:37:30,800 --> 03:37:31,500
I'm fine with that.

3711
03:37:31,600 --> 03:37:32,740
I'm fine with that, guys.

3712
03:37:32,840 --> 03:37:33,340
I'm fine.

3713
03:37:34,220 --> 03:37:35,320
Alright, is this what I need?

3714
03:37:36,360 --> 03:37:37,940
Oh, I got the Crimson Crest.

3715
03:37:38,040 --> 03:37:39,240
Oh wait, I can get...

3716
03:37:40,280 --> 03:37:42,140
Get that incense one last time.

3717
03:37:43,300 --> 03:37:48,000
Let me get that incense in me one last time before we go.

3718
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:53,820
Alright, nice.

3719
03:37:53,840 --> 03:37:54,280
Let's go.

3720
03:37:54,880 --> 03:37:55,580
Let's head over.

3721
03:37:56,740 --> 03:37:58,160
One last ride.

3722
03:38:08,820 --> 03:38:09,880
Time for the good stuff.

3723
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:12,980
Time to relax before I go murder people again.

3724
03:38:20,760 --> 03:38:22,440
I thought Bai Long is the chief.

3725
03:38:25,740 --> 03:38:26,260
What?

3726
03:38:28,100 --> 03:38:29,200
Just cut his hair.

3727
03:38:29,780 --> 03:38:30,380
Cut his hair!

3728
03:38:38,700 --> 03:38:41,300
How do I cope with killing millions of people?

3729
03:38:41,780 --> 03:38:43,860
I don't know, but light up that incense, baby.

3730
03:39:06,420 --> 03:39:13,380
That means those two died?

3731
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:23,480
Yeah?

3732
03:39:33,020 --> 03:39:35,120
So what happened to those two?

3733
03:39:37,540 --> 03:39:39,800
Yeah, but I don't know what's real or not.

3734
03:39:39,920 --> 03:39:41,520
Like, is she actually...

3735
03:39:41,520 --> 03:39:43,380
Alive or is she just my visions?

3736
03:39:43,500 --> 03:39:44,360
My incense visions?

3737
03:39:44,580 --> 03:39:47,240
Because I'm the only one that sees these two, too.

3738
03:39:47,560 --> 03:39:49,220
Like, no one else sees them.

3739
03:39:54,960 --> 03:39:57,060
Like, she's next to me and I'm like, do you see her?

3740
03:39:57,180 --> 03:40:00,600
And then my doctor was like, I don't know, but you want a stronger incense?

3741
03:40:03,260 --> 03:40:03,980
Innocence?

3742
03:40:18,700 --> 03:40:21,440
I thought you were one of the strongest warriors.

3743
03:40:30,980 --> 03:40:33,780
I've been told they were a proud people.

3744
03:40:34,720 --> 03:40:39,420
The truth is, there was never any reason to tie yourself to the village.

3745
03:40:39,860 --> 03:40:40,740
You mean I could just leave?

3746
03:40:40,920 --> 03:40:42,740
You always had the means to leave.

3747
03:40:42,760 --> 03:40:43,300
Wait, what the fuck?

3748
03:40:43,400 --> 03:40:44,340
I could just leave?

3749
03:40:44,540 --> 03:40:48,760
You have the freedom to fly far, far away from this place.

3750
03:40:49,640 --> 03:40:51,800
Wherever your destiny might lead you.

3751
03:40:52,700 --> 03:40:55,980
I want to go on that journey with you and Bai Long, too.

3752
03:40:57,480 --> 03:40:58,960
Into a world of peace.

3753
03:41:02,460 --> 03:41:03,600
Peace, okay.

3754
03:41:04,820 --> 03:41:08,800
Okay, this woman does not know what's outside this world.

3755
03:41:09,220 --> 03:41:10,760
What the fuck do you mean, peace?

3756
03:41:11,640 --> 03:41:17,860
I literally left the village and there's like a fucking war and famine going on.

3757
03:41:19,500 --> 03:41:23,320
Oh my god, surely a world outside this village is better.

3758
03:41:25,120 --> 03:41:26,140
Does she know?

3759
03:41:26,520 --> 03:41:28,520
Your treatment is going quite well.

3760
03:41:28,520 --> 03:41:32,640
I think we may soon see the day that your memory is completely restored.

3761
03:41:32,820 --> 03:41:34,800
Try to find some thistle done.

3762
03:41:34,940 --> 03:41:36,300
They say it grows in Yang province.

3763
03:41:36,500 --> 03:41:38,820
It's a rare commodity, but I have faith in your abilities.

3764
03:41:38,940 --> 03:41:39,980
Oh my god, there's more.

3765
03:41:40,260 --> 03:41:42,140
I thought that was the last one.

3766
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:46,560
What the fuck does she mean, peace?

3767
03:41:48,220 --> 03:41:51,420
I went out of this village and I murdered so many people.

3768
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:56,940
It must be so peaceful outside.

3769
03:41:58,520 --> 03:41:59,720
Alright, get to the camp.

3770
03:42:10,320 --> 03:42:11,200
Hello.

3771
03:42:28,420 --> 03:42:34,080
Wait, will they grow mustaches?

3772
03:42:34,680 --> 03:42:37,100
I feel like I'm talking to boys.

3773
03:42:37,400 --> 03:42:38,080
Little boys.

3774
03:42:57,160 --> 03:43:00,580
Where are my mustachioed men?

3775
03:43:04,620 --> 03:43:07,080
Their faces are naked.

3776
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:14,260
Me too, I'm leaving.

3777
03:43:25,140 --> 03:43:25,720
God.

3778
03:43:29,620 --> 03:43:35,560
It's just wrong to see Tao Tao and Liu Bei without a mustache.

3779
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:37,000
It's just weird.

3780
03:43:37,180 --> 03:43:38,300
It's so weird.

3781
03:43:44,540 --> 03:43:45,840
Especially Tao Tao.

3782
03:43:46,180 --> 03:43:52,480
I feel like Tao Tao, if anybody, should be the one that should have had a mustache.

3783
03:44:01,880 --> 03:44:03,080
It's okay.

3784
03:44:05,500 --> 03:44:07,880
It's okay, it makes it more exciting.

3785
03:44:09,840 --> 03:44:11,780
It's a nice thought, but...

3786
03:44:12,680 --> 03:44:14,940
It's like Romeo and Juliet, one guy.

3787
03:44:22,060 --> 03:44:27,920
Last time we were together.

3788
03:44:29,540 --> 03:44:30,300
Okay.

3789
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:44,690
Is that it?

3790
03:44:45,950 --> 03:44:48,610
Was that interaction just because that guy misses me?

3791
03:44:52,570 --> 03:44:54,090
Oh shit.

3792
03:44:54,850 --> 03:44:56,930
I'm watching from the corner.

3793
03:45:09,810 --> 03:45:12,030
Guys, do you see the tension right now?

3794
03:45:12,690 --> 03:45:13,610
Oh my god.

3795
03:45:15,510 --> 03:45:15,850
Oh.

3796
03:45:27,750 --> 03:45:30,790
And yet, I can't get you out of my mind.

3797
03:45:31,190 --> 03:45:32,430
Oh my god.

3798
03:45:33,810 --> 03:45:36,910
And you kept saying in my mind.

3799
03:45:56,670 --> 03:46:00,550
Bro, he's saying you fell off, Liu Bei.

3800
03:46:00,910 --> 03:46:01,890
You fell off, bro!

3801
03:46:18,670 --> 03:46:22,390
Tao Tao's just like, I still thought I saw you as an equal.

3802
03:46:23,290 --> 03:46:25,190
Now you're lower than me.

3803
03:46:25,570 --> 03:46:26,910
And I'm not into that.

3804
03:46:29,650 --> 03:46:33,210
He's like, I am not into that, man.

3805
03:46:35,370 --> 03:46:38,290
Alright, I got another letter.

3806
03:46:38,290 --> 03:46:38,370
Okay.

3807
03:47:01,850 --> 03:47:05,090
I just did.

3808
03:47:05,250 --> 03:47:06,450
You want me to do more?

3809
03:47:10,240 --> 03:47:10,680
Alright.

3810
03:47:12,380 --> 03:47:13,260
Alright, 35.

3811
03:47:13,640 --> 03:47:18,000
I am not level 35, but that's okay.

3812
03:47:18,680 --> 03:47:20,780
I think, oh man, I don't know now.

3813
03:47:20,840 --> 03:47:21,620
I'm a little scared.

3814
03:47:23,020 --> 03:47:24,840
Maybe I can do this one level.

3815
03:47:24,940 --> 03:47:27,620
I'll do this one level and I should be level 35, right?

3816
03:47:29,360 --> 03:47:31,280
Okay, this is level 29.

3817
03:47:33,160 --> 03:47:33,600
Alright.

3818
03:47:34,060 --> 03:47:35,400
No, I'm a little worried.

3819
03:47:35,420 --> 03:47:37,340
I'm a little worried doing above my level.

3820
03:47:41,080 --> 03:47:43,000
Alright, let's use the dragoon.

3821
03:47:43,280 --> 03:47:44,640
The dragoon thing.

3822
03:47:46,400 --> 03:47:47,740
Wait, what do I have to kill?

3823
03:47:47,840 --> 03:47:48,260
The bandits?

3824
03:47:48,540 --> 03:47:49,260
Jesus Christ.

3825
03:47:50,540 --> 03:47:50,800
Alright.

3826
03:47:53,320 --> 03:47:54,180
No way!

3827
03:47:54,660 --> 03:47:55,600
I'm coming for him!

3828
03:47:56,820 --> 03:47:58,160
Alright, tornado time!

3829
03:48:00,060 --> 03:48:01,140
Holy shit!

3830
03:48:01,480 --> 03:48:03,420
Wait, this- what the fuck?

3831
03:48:03,520 --> 03:48:04,580
Okay, that shit's strong.

3832
03:48:05,940 --> 03:48:09,320
Oh my god, I killed 700 people already.

3833
03:48:09,440 --> 03:48:09,700
Okay.

3834
03:48:11,220 --> 03:48:13,700
Tornado, face the wrath!

3835
03:48:16,660 --> 03:48:19,500
Okay, I was not expecting 700 already.

3836
03:48:21,380 --> 03:48:22,160
Alright.

3837
03:48:23,840 --> 03:48:25,760
Alright, tornado time!

3838
03:48:29,980 --> 03:48:30,760
Tornado!

3839
03:48:32,340 --> 03:48:33,160
Nice, goodbye.

3840
03:48:34,580 --> 03:48:40,040
Alright, I should be at- I should be close to level 35, right?

3841
03:48:41,720 --> 03:48:43,340
Alright, it's tornado time again.

3842
03:48:43,420 --> 03:48:44,540
Wait, I already used up all of it.

3843
03:48:44,660 --> 03:48:45,940
Okay, no tornado time.

3844
03:48:47,040 --> 03:48:47,480
Unfortunate.

3845
03:48:47,700 --> 03:48:49,180
Oh wait, it's tornado time!

3846
03:48:49,600 --> 03:48:49,900
Woo!

3847
03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:52,880
Oh shit.

3848
03:48:53,040 --> 03:48:53,580
Okay, don't worry.

3849
03:48:53,680 --> 03:48:54,340
I still got him.

3850
03:48:54,800 --> 03:48:55,660
I still got him.

3851
03:48:57,820 --> 03:48:58,260
Goodbye.

3852
03:48:59,300 --> 03:49:00,180
Spin the wind.

3853
03:49:00,460 --> 03:49:00,780
Spin!

3854
03:49:02,720 --> 03:49:05,120
Alright, time to fight the actual boss.

3855
03:49:05,820 --> 03:49:07,080
Alright, I'm heading over.

3856
03:49:08,060 --> 03:49:09,040
Get over here.

3857
03:49:10,120 --> 03:49:12,100
Oh, I have to kill 700!

3858
03:49:12,600 --> 03:49:14,060
Oh, that's my entire mission!

3859
03:49:14,260 --> 03:49:15,180
I'm sorry, I didn't read.

3860
03:49:15,760 --> 03:49:16,540
You guys know that.

3861
03:49:17,240 --> 03:49:18,520
I'm not here to read.

3862
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:20,520
I've only killed like 400.

3863
03:49:23,760 --> 03:49:24,100
Alright.

3864
03:49:26,780 --> 03:49:27,020
Ew.

3865
03:49:27,020 --> 03:49:28,040
Ew.

3866
03:49:29,640 --> 03:49:30,540
It's fine.

3867
03:49:32,520 --> 03:49:32,700
Spin!

3868
03:49:34,240 --> 03:49:34,840
Nice.

3869
03:49:35,240 --> 03:49:36,120
He's spinning!

3870
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:38,640
Wait, why is he not spinning?

3871
03:49:39,280 --> 03:49:40,400
I'm gonna say, what's the point?

3872
03:49:42,180 --> 03:49:43,740
I just want you to spin!

3873
03:49:46,020 --> 03:49:47,340
Alright, get over here.

3874
03:49:47,600 --> 03:49:48,480
It's time to spin.

3875
03:49:49,340 --> 03:49:49,680
Spin!

3876
03:49:50,840 --> 03:49:51,520
Oh shit.

3877
03:49:52,300 --> 03:49:52,940
He's spinning!

3878
03:49:54,120 --> 03:49:54,720
Nice.

3879
03:49:57,120 --> 03:49:59,000
Alright, that should kill him soon, right?

3880
03:50:00,740 --> 03:50:03,480
Oh, armor or bo- wait, let's just kill him then.

3881
03:50:05,020 --> 03:50:05,340
Spin!

3882
03:50:06,280 --> 03:50:07,260
Where did he go?

3883
03:50:08,060 --> 03:50:11,260
I just spun so- I was like, what the fuck?

3884
03:50:12,600 --> 03:50:14,120
Where did he spin to?

3885
03:50:16,660 --> 03:50:17,480
It's fine.

3886
03:50:18,620 --> 03:50:19,140
Alright.

3887
03:50:20,720 --> 03:50:21,500
Oh shit.

3888
03:50:22,380 --> 03:50:25,720
I didn't remember like, what the cancel moves are for this one.

3889
03:50:27,020 --> 03:50:27,760
Nice, we did it.

3890
03:50:32,740 --> 03:50:34,860
Come on, I just need 200 more.

3891
03:50:37,160 --> 03:50:38,360
Where are the rest?

3892
03:50:39,240 --> 03:50:40,400
Alright, we gotta go this way.

3893
03:50:41,860 --> 03:50:44,400
He spun too fast, I was like, where'd he go?

3894
03:50:46,960 --> 03:50:48,720
Alright, it's spinning time!

3895
03:50:52,120 --> 03:50:52,520
Alright.

3896
03:50:54,120 --> 03:50:54,720
Spin!

3897
03:50:57,020 --> 03:50:57,780
Holy fuck!

3898
03:50:58,260 --> 03:50:59,300
Where did they all go?

3899
03:51:01,320 --> 03:51:01,840
Whoops.

3900
03:51:04,000 --> 03:51:04,520
Nice.

3901
03:51:05,000 --> 03:51:05,960
That should be everybody.

3902
03:51:06,660 --> 03:51:08,260
Okay, no, we still have yet to kill.

3903
03:51:09,960 --> 03:51:12,420
Oh nice, okay, the general has finally arrived.

3904
03:51:12,500 --> 03:51:13,260
Alright, nice.

3905
03:51:20,100 --> 03:51:22,000
It's all about sending a message.

3906
03:51:23,260 --> 03:51:25,460
Thank you, you guys like- you guys like that?

3907
03:51:25,460 --> 03:51:26,880
You guys like that?

3908
03:51:27,240 --> 03:51:28,460
How I didn't kill anybody?

3909
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:31,160
Yeah?

3910
03:51:32,180 --> 03:51:32,380
Spin!

3911
03:51:34,040 --> 03:51:35,080
Get over here.

3912
03:51:35,880 --> 03:51:36,720
Spin again!

3913
03:51:37,660 --> 03:51:39,320
Just keep spinning!

3914
03:51:41,180 --> 03:51:42,500
Just keep spinning!

3915
03:51:44,520 --> 03:51:47,420
I just need to kill one more and I'm done.

3916
03:51:48,980 --> 03:51:50,540
Alright, now I just have to kill him.

3917
03:51:51,920 --> 03:51:53,260
And then you keep spinning.

3918
03:51:55,460 --> 03:51:56,480
Spinning my tornado.

3919
03:51:57,180 --> 03:51:58,960
It's raining, man.

3920
03:52:00,980 --> 03:52:02,480
I'll just keep using that.

3921
03:52:06,220 --> 03:52:09,360
He's like, where am I?

3922
03:52:12,500 --> 03:52:13,580
Alright, nice.

3923
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:16,580
You think I'm gonna stop?

3924
03:52:18,320 --> 03:52:19,960
You never stop spinning.

3925
03:52:19,960 --> 03:52:20,400
Spinning.

3926
03:52:22,570 --> 03:52:25,060
I refuse to ever let you stop.

3927
03:52:28,720 --> 03:52:29,820
Spin!

3928
03:52:33,590 --> 03:52:34,960
Let's do something!

3929
03:52:35,480 --> 03:52:37,420
She's using magic!

3930
03:52:39,550 --> 03:52:41,380
Somebody stop her!

3931
03:52:44,460 --> 03:52:44,880
Nice.

3932
03:52:45,820 --> 03:52:46,100
Yay!

3933
03:52:47,200 --> 03:52:48,120
It's mine now.

3934
03:52:50,640 --> 03:52:51,200
Alright.

3935
03:52:51,520 --> 03:52:54,100
Swing your spear to generate whirlwind around you.

3936
03:52:54,400 --> 03:52:54,780
Okay.

3937
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:56,160
I don't need that.

3938
03:52:57,460 --> 03:52:59,440
I already have what I need.

3939
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:04,220
Okay, nice.

3940
03:53:05,040 --> 03:53:06,280
Do I do anything else?

3941
03:53:06,340 --> 03:53:06,640
No?

3942
03:53:09,820 --> 03:53:12,060
Yeah, magic isn't against the rules.

3943
03:53:12,340 --> 03:53:13,720
Void Town, thank you for the super chat!

3944
03:53:13,820 --> 03:53:14,780
Thank you, thank you!

3945
03:53:15,340 --> 03:53:17,300
What flavor would you like your smoothie to be?

3946
03:53:18,080 --> 03:53:18,640
What?

3947
03:53:18,640 --> 03:53:20,700
Thank you for the super chat!

3948
03:53:20,980 --> 03:53:22,100
Thank you, thank you!

3949
03:53:24,300 --> 03:53:25,100
Am I...

3950
03:53:25,100 --> 03:53:25,540
Oh, nice.

3951
03:53:25,580 --> 03:53:25,720
See?

3952
03:53:25,820 --> 03:53:26,320
Look at that.

3953
03:53:27,200 --> 03:53:28,240
I leveled up twice.

3954
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:29,040
See, guys?

3955
03:53:29,480 --> 03:53:30,900
All I had to do was spin.

3956
03:53:41,000 --> 03:53:43,200
Oh, because they were in the blender!

3957
03:53:44,420 --> 03:53:45,280
I get it!

3958
03:53:48,420 --> 03:53:49,840
Loli, thank you for the super chat!

3959
03:53:49,940 --> 03:53:50,700
Thank you, thank you!

3960
03:53:50,700 --> 03:53:54,780
So Doki, about Yu Yan's perfect Doki doll, wasn't her first invention something that...

3961
03:53:57,840 --> 03:54:01,380
Currently marching towards Shou Chun at the behest of Lord Lubu.

3962
03:54:01,900 --> 03:54:05,320
This is in accordance with the Imperial decree to bring down Yuan Shu.

3963
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:11,040
Yuan Shu is a powerful threat to Shu province, even without orders from the Emperor.

3964
03:54:11,260 --> 03:54:13,260
We'd still have to deal with him eventually.

3965
03:54:14,260 --> 03:54:14,440
What?

3966
03:54:14,660 --> 03:54:16,080
Jesus Christ, like...

3967
03:54:16,080 --> 03:54:17,420
Can you bring more people?

3968
03:54:18,580 --> 03:54:19,100
Like...

3969
03:54:19,800 --> 03:54:22,440
Lu Bei, why do you never bring enough?

3970
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:23,780
Like, I don't understand.

3971
03:54:26,040 --> 03:54:29,400
I'm not merely acting on the whims of Lord Lubu alone.

3972
03:54:30,100 --> 03:54:33,100
Brother, you've been acting strange since your return from Tao Tao's camp.

3973
03:54:33,480 --> 03:54:36,260
Is something he said to you troubling your thoughts?

3974
03:54:37,100 --> 03:54:37,760
Ah, no.

3975
03:54:37,860 --> 03:54:38,440
I'm fine.

3976
03:54:38,620 --> 03:54:39,320
It's nothing.

3977
03:54:39,860 --> 03:54:42,760
For this battle, our side has formed an alliance of three forces.

3978
03:54:43,260 --> 03:54:44,920
Tao Tao, Sun Tzu, and Lord Lubu.

3979
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:46,940
Each commander must survive or...

3980
03:54:46,940 --> 03:54:48,620
Okay, I have to protect four people.

3981
03:54:48,620 --> 03:54:49,080
Okay.

3982
03:54:50,440 --> 03:54:51,900
Alright, that's cool.

3983
03:54:52,420 --> 03:54:55,260
I have to protect all four of them and hope they don't die.

3984
03:54:55,520 --> 03:54:56,360
Okay, that's cool.

3985
03:54:57,080 --> 03:54:59,560
Meanwhile, Sun Tzu's forces will be attacking from the east.

3986
03:54:59,740 --> 03:55:02,300
Their plan is to use Siege Tower to scale the castle walls.

3987
03:55:02,780 --> 03:55:05,820
The success of both strategies will be critical to storming the castle.

3988
03:55:06,740 --> 03:55:10,600
But we should also render aid on the eastern front as much as possible.

3989
03:55:11,120 --> 03:55:12,880
I think that's all there is to discuss now.

3990
03:55:13,920 --> 03:55:15,920
Just charging into battle at Lubu's...

3991
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:16,660
Okay, Guan Yu.

3992
03:55:16,880 --> 03:55:17,940
This is all we've been doing.

3993
03:55:18,100 --> 03:55:18,900
Nothing is different.

3994
03:55:19,300 --> 03:55:23,800
Even if Lubu is telling us to do it, we've done this since Lu Bei was commanding us.

3995
03:55:24,700 --> 03:55:26,020
Do you really wish to know, Guan Yu?

3996
03:55:26,440 --> 03:55:28,440
Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have...

3997
03:55:28,440 --> 03:55:31,860
Like, that's not different from any other strategy Lu Bei has done.

3998
03:55:32,060 --> 03:55:34,320
Like, all we've done is just charge in.

3999
03:55:34,380 --> 03:55:34,940
I don't understand.

4000
03:55:35,300 --> 03:55:36,640
Different leaders, same strategy.

4001
03:55:37,040 --> 03:55:38,280
Like, nothing has changed.

4002
03:55:40,580 --> 03:55:43,040
Clearly, nothing has changed in this strategy.

4003
03:55:46,440 --> 03:55:49,160
We're still doing the same thing we've always done.

4004
03:55:53,160 --> 03:55:56,640
And now he's like, are you sure this is a good idea?

4005
03:55:56,980 --> 03:55:59,260
Not that Lubu's the fucking leader.

4006
03:55:59,940 --> 03:56:03,020
Look, none of this was ever a good idea.

4007
03:56:03,280 --> 03:56:04,720
Like, I hate to say it.

4008
03:56:05,080 --> 03:56:06,560
None of it was ever good.

4009
03:56:09,600 --> 03:56:10,080
Spin!

4010
03:56:12,320 --> 03:56:14,380
This is the only move I know how to do.

4011
03:56:15,100 --> 03:56:15,780
Yes!

4012
03:56:17,720 --> 03:56:20,680
This is the only thing I know how to do now.

4013
03:56:28,460 --> 03:56:29,560
Alright, nice.

4014
03:56:33,340 --> 03:56:34,020
Okay.

4015
03:56:39,920 --> 03:56:41,580
Get outta here!

4016
03:56:44,440 --> 03:56:45,020
Stereo.

4017
03:56:45,280 --> 03:56:45,860
Easy.

4018
03:56:46,540 --> 03:56:47,580
We got the base.

4019
03:56:48,260 --> 03:56:49,400
Now we leave.

4020
03:56:49,620 --> 03:56:50,660
Open the gates!

4021
03:56:51,520 --> 03:56:52,690
Open the gates!

4022
03:56:53,460 --> 03:56:54,560
Alright, we fight.

4023
03:56:58,180 --> 03:56:59,040
Alright, let's go.

4024
03:57:02,500 --> 03:57:04,060
That's fine, I can do that.

4025
03:57:04,440 --> 03:57:06,060
I have one move only.

4026
03:57:06,440 --> 03:57:08,180
And it has worked so far.

4027
03:57:08,340 --> 03:57:11,440
Okay, I don't know how I got fucking collapsed, but that's okay.

4028
03:57:12,360 --> 03:57:15,340
This one move has always worked for me.

4029
03:57:18,520 --> 03:57:19,540
Alright, encourage!

4030
03:57:22,760 --> 03:57:23,220
Alright.

4031
03:57:28,220 --> 03:57:30,400
I don't know where anybody is.

4032
03:57:30,980 --> 03:57:35,540
Alright, let's beat up this old man first.

4033
03:57:37,320 --> 03:57:38,280
That's fine.

4034
03:57:39,460 --> 03:57:40,900
You know what this means!

4035
03:57:40,900 --> 03:57:42,240
Okay, we have to do this fast.

4036
03:57:44,780 --> 03:57:46,460
Alright, you know what to do!

4037
03:57:46,580 --> 03:57:47,060
Oh shit!

4038
03:57:47,460 --> 03:57:48,980
You know- Oh, I can't do it, nevermind.

4039
03:57:49,520 --> 03:57:49,920
Nevermind.

4040
03:57:52,640 --> 03:57:54,060
Jesus Christ, where is he?

4041
03:57:58,560 --> 03:58:00,580
I don't know if I like the spear, guys.

4042
03:58:00,740 --> 03:58:02,240
I think like...

4043
03:58:02,240 --> 03:58:03,420
Okay, actually I do- No!

4044
03:58:05,260 --> 03:58:07,920
The one thing I look forward to in life!

4045
03:58:08,740 --> 03:58:10,500
And he fucking denied it!

4046
03:58:10,700 --> 03:58:13,580
He interrupted it with a giant fucking rock!

4047
03:58:13,860 --> 03:58:14,940
I'm so sad.

4048
03:58:17,520 --> 03:58:18,120
What is that?

4049
03:58:18,840 --> 03:58:19,960
Full chariot charge?

4050
03:58:20,100 --> 03:58:20,820
Who do I kill?

4051
03:58:22,960 --> 03:58:24,000
Destroy the two chariots.

4052
03:58:24,080 --> 03:58:24,760
Okay, give me a sec.

4053
03:58:24,820 --> 03:58:26,640
Let me beat up this old man real quick.

4054
03:58:26,800 --> 03:58:27,680
Alright, where are they?

4055
03:58:28,520 --> 03:58:29,920
Alright, there he is.

4056
03:58:30,040 --> 03:58:31,660
Okay, I need him to get closer.

4057
03:58:32,540 --> 03:58:35,280
Hey, can the chariot get a little closer to me?

4058
03:58:35,440 --> 03:58:36,060
It sucks.

4059
03:58:36,580 --> 03:58:37,520
Okay, give me a sec.

4060
03:58:38,320 --> 03:58:46,780
They're riding- Please, I'm trying so hard to get closer to the chari- Oh my god, please!

4061
03:58:47,320 --> 03:58:48,100
I'm trying!

4062
03:58:49,320 --> 03:58:50,400
Bro, okay.

4063
03:58:50,800 --> 03:58:52,540
This is actually- Okay, guys.

4064
03:58:53,420 --> 03:58:57,800
I am trying my hardest to get as close as I can to these chariots.

4065
03:58:58,200 --> 03:59:03,300
Like, he's just- Like, he's not letting me near him.

4066
03:59:04,400 --> 03:59:05,800
Oh my god, there we go.

4067
03:59:05,880 --> 03:59:06,440
We got one.

4068
03:59:06,440 --> 03:59:07,880
We got one.

4069
03:59:07,940 --> 03:59:08,400
Okay.

4070
03:59:08,740 --> 03:59:09,840
Okay, this is bad.

4071
03:59:10,240 --> 03:59:11,720
This is so bad.

4072
03:59:14,460 --> 03:59:16,200
I can't see!

4073
03:59:16,660 --> 03:59:17,760
Where am I?!

4074
03:59:18,160 --> 03:59:19,560
Oh my god!

4075
03:59:22,440 --> 03:59:27,620
Where is the other chari- Where am I?!

4076
03:59:29,600 --> 03:59:30,940
Oh my god.

4077
03:59:31,300 --> 03:59:32,880
Where is the other chariot?

4078
03:59:33,220 --> 03:59:35,220
Where is the other chariot?!

4079
03:59:35,220 --> 03:59:35,860
I can't see!

4080
03:59:37,940 --> 03:59:38,340
What?

4081
03:59:39,340 --> 03:59:40,660
Oh my god, there it is.

4082
03:59:42,480 --> 03:59:43,720
Okay, we gotta head over there.

4083
03:59:44,500 --> 03:59:46,260
I'm literally in tro- Okay, we did it.

4084
03:59:46,300 --> 03:59:47,280
I don't know where it is.

4085
03:59:47,600 --> 03:59:48,220
We did it.

4086
03:59:48,560 --> 03:59:50,900
I actually- I don't know how I did it.

4087
03:59:50,940 --> 03:59:51,380
We did it.

4088
03:59:56,140 --> 03:59:58,600
I don't know how we did it, but we did it.

4089
04:00:01,200 --> 04:00:02,900
Like, there's so many people here.

4090
04:00:02,980 --> 04:00:03,900
I'm so lost.

4091
04:00:04,900 --> 04:00:07,020
I'm actually so lost right now.

4092
04:00:10,690 --> 04:00:12,360
Okay, we're fine.

4093
04:00:15,020 --> 04:00:16,420
We're so fine.

4094
04:00:19,040 --> 04:00:20,440
Everything is okay.

4095
04:00:23,160 --> 04:00:23,900
SPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNN!

4096
04:00:24,900 --> 04:00:26,960
I think everything is okay.

4097
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:27,840
I can tell.

4098
04:00:28,780 --> 04:00:31,580
There's so many bodies in front of me.

4099
04:00:32,160 --> 04:00:33,500
I can't tell anymore.

4100
04:00:36,380 --> 04:00:37,800
He's playing with yellow.

4101
04:00:37,960 --> 04:00:38,880
Thanks, guys.

4102
04:00:41,780 --> 04:00:42,300
Okay.

4103
04:00:44,420 --> 04:00:45,320
Alright, he's fine.

4104
04:00:45,480 --> 04:00:47,160
Tau Tau is so healthy right now.

4105
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:49,820
Me, I'm not so much.

4106
04:00:51,560 --> 04:00:53,360
Not so much, I would admit.

4107
04:00:54,960 --> 04:00:55,480
Spit!

4108
04:00:55,660 --> 04:00:56,320
Oh, shit.

4109
04:00:56,980 --> 04:00:57,860
Oh, shit.

4110
04:00:58,200 --> 04:00:59,060
Oh, shit!

4111
04:00:59,100 --> 04:01:00,700
Okay, we gotta use this.

4112
04:01:02,480 --> 04:01:05,240
Keep... Don't worry, he's so alive!

4113
04:01:06,940 --> 04:01:08,460
He's so alive!

4114
04:01:08,680 --> 04:01:09,740
I think he's fine.

4115
04:01:09,940 --> 04:01:10,940
I think he'll be fine.

4116
04:01:11,960 --> 04:01:15,920
I can see how alive he is somewhere in this area.

4117
04:01:16,580 --> 04:01:19,460
Like, I'm pretty sure he's very alive.

4118
04:01:19,980 --> 04:01:21,060
He's somewhere there.

4119
04:01:26,180 --> 04:01:31,020
Like, I might not know where he is, but I am pretty sure he's okay.

4120
04:01:32,280 --> 04:01:33,920
He's so healthy!

4121
04:01:35,700 --> 04:01:41,080
He's somewhere here, and I believe he's incredibly healthy somewhere.

4122
04:01:46,780 --> 04:01:49,460
Like, I was like, Doki, protect him!

4123
04:01:49,580 --> 04:01:51,560
And I'm like, I think he's okay?

4124
04:01:53,540 --> 04:01:55,220
I think so?

4125
04:01:58,840 --> 04:02:00,440
Alright, am I doing anything?

4126
04:02:03,220 --> 04:02:06,260
Okay, Guan Yu might actually die, though.

4127
04:02:08,900 --> 04:02:11,640
Okay, we can get rid of this one chariot.

4128
04:02:13,740 --> 04:02:15,380
Alright, are they all dead?

4129
04:02:15,680 --> 04:02:17,520
Please tell me I have killed them all!

4130
04:02:17,980 --> 04:02:18,760
Alright, nice.

4131
04:02:20,820 --> 04:02:21,960
Okay, we did it.

4132
04:02:23,440 --> 04:02:24,900
Alright, let's help the reds.

4133
04:02:27,080 --> 04:02:28,860
Alright, we gotta go help the red.

4134
04:02:30,260 --> 04:02:31,120
Real quick.

4135
04:02:33,020 --> 04:02:34,220
Don't worry, I got them.

4136
04:02:37,160 --> 04:02:38,140
I believe.

4137
04:02:38,640 --> 04:02:40,100
Don't worry, reds!

4138
04:02:40,260 --> 04:02:42,180
It's my turn to help you!

4139
04:02:43,200 --> 04:02:44,700
They're so healthy!

4140
04:02:45,400 --> 04:02:47,420
See, I told you they're so healthy.

4141
04:02:47,520 --> 04:02:48,280
Let's help the child.

4142
04:02:51,460 --> 04:02:52,820
See, I told you.

4143
04:02:52,900 --> 04:02:53,420
Look at that.

4144
04:02:53,880 --> 04:02:54,740
Where did he go?

4145
04:02:57,460 --> 04:02:59,420
Sometimes I just don't know where they are.

4146
04:03:00,300 --> 04:03:01,520
Alright, encourage!

4147
04:03:02,700 --> 04:03:03,660
And then charge!

4148
04:03:03,840 --> 04:03:04,580
Do everything!

4149
04:03:05,080 --> 04:03:06,320
Dragons, everything!

4150
04:03:08,900 --> 04:03:10,840
Don't let him touch the ground!

4151
04:03:13,320 --> 04:03:14,420
Alright, nice.

4152
04:03:15,100 --> 04:03:16,600
See, I told you they're fine.

4153
04:03:19,320 --> 04:03:20,020
Spin!

4154
04:03:24,260 --> 04:03:26,000
Nice, we need that.

4155
04:03:26,960 --> 04:03:28,120
We need that.

4156
04:03:29,420 --> 04:03:30,660
Am I doing anything?

4157
04:03:31,500 --> 04:03:32,780
Oh, there we go.

4158
04:03:33,680 --> 04:03:34,160
Look at that.

4159
04:03:34,380 --> 04:03:35,340
Don't worry, child.

4160
04:03:36,060 --> 04:03:36,700
Boom!

4161
04:03:41,180 --> 04:03:41,860
Goodbye!

4162
04:03:41,860 --> 04:03:42,540
Nice.

4163
04:03:42,760 --> 04:03:44,420
Oh my god, we're actually getting buns.

4164
04:03:46,380 --> 04:03:47,060
Magic!

4165
04:03:50,800 --> 04:03:51,480
Nice.

4166
04:03:54,360 --> 04:03:55,040
Assault!

4167
04:03:56,260 --> 04:03:56,960
There we go.

4168
04:03:57,740 --> 04:03:58,880
Is that it?

4169
04:03:59,960 --> 04:04:00,460
Is there anymore?

4170
04:04:02,480 --> 04:04:03,720
Oh no, there is.

4171
04:04:03,880 --> 04:04:04,380
Get over here.

4172
04:04:04,820 --> 04:04:05,980
Get over here!

4173
04:04:07,920 --> 04:04:08,960
Get over here!

4174
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:10,640
You think men can protect you?

4175
04:04:13,320 --> 04:04:14,640
Get over here!

4176
04:04:14,920 --> 04:04:16,640
Oh my god, get in this corner!

4177
04:04:20,240 --> 04:04:21,360
That's fucking right.

4178
04:04:21,840 --> 04:04:23,560
That's right, stay in the corner!

4179
04:04:26,960 --> 04:04:28,540
I won't let you leave!

4180
04:04:30,220 --> 04:04:31,120
Alright, goodbye.

4181
04:04:31,900 --> 04:04:32,380
Nice.

4182
04:04:35,040 --> 04:04:35,520
Spin!

4183
04:04:38,380 --> 04:04:40,200
The corner of shame.

4184
04:04:44,520 --> 04:04:45,500
Wait, where did he go?

4185
04:04:45,840 --> 04:04:46,520
He left the corner.

4186
04:04:47,540 --> 04:04:48,580
Where did he go?

4187
04:04:49,160 --> 04:04:50,480
Who let him out of the corner?

4188
04:04:51,780 --> 04:04:52,340
Get over here.

4189
04:04:53,620 --> 04:04:55,880
I refuse to ever let you leave this corner.

4190
04:04:57,400 --> 04:04:59,260
That's right, you live here now.

4191
04:04:59,720 --> 04:05:02,080
And now you live here in the corner.

4192
04:05:04,840 --> 04:05:06,140
That's fucking right.

4193
04:05:07,300 --> 04:05:08,040
Get back in there!

4194
04:05:08,220 --> 04:05:08,880
Get back in there!

4195
04:05:09,920 --> 04:05:11,980
The prisoner of the corner.

4196
04:05:12,620 --> 04:05:14,220
Get your ass back in here!

4197
04:05:14,900 --> 04:05:15,640
Alright, we did it.

4198
04:05:15,860 --> 04:05:15,980
Yay!

4199
04:05:20,880 --> 04:05:22,380
Alright, you're welcome guys.

4200
04:05:27,540 --> 04:05:29,300
The prisoner here of the corner.

4201
04:05:30,980 --> 04:05:32,360
Alright, we go this way.

4202
04:05:39,040 --> 04:05:41,960
I don't wanna climb up, so I'm gonna go through the door.

4203
04:05:44,200 --> 04:05:45,840
I'm just like, alright, you guys got that.

4204
04:05:45,900 --> 04:05:47,000
I'm not climbing up there.

4205
04:05:48,220 --> 04:05:49,700
Absol, thank you for the super chat.

4206
04:05:49,760 --> 04:05:50,680
Thank you, thank you.

4207
04:05:50,740 --> 04:05:53,280
When you wanted tactics but Lupe gave you TikTok.

4208
04:05:54,060 --> 04:05:55,440
Thank you for the super chat.

4209
04:05:55,520 --> 04:05:56,420
Thank you, thank you.

4210
04:05:57,300 --> 04:05:58,560
Alright, we're almost there.

4211
04:06:01,600 --> 04:06:03,300
Alright, give me more generals to kill.

4212
04:06:03,380 --> 04:06:04,220
I need to level up.

4213
04:06:04,360 --> 04:06:05,240
Oh shit, okay.

4214
04:06:05,660 --> 04:06:06,860
Now I can do it.

4215
04:06:10,520 --> 04:06:10,960
Easy.

4216
04:06:11,640 --> 04:06:12,520
Alright, I'm going in.

4217
04:06:13,440 --> 04:06:14,820
I'm going straight in.

4218
04:06:16,360 --> 04:06:18,920
Alright, I'm not going straight in.

4219
04:06:22,120 --> 04:06:24,200
Alright, we'll deal with that later.

4220
04:06:24,320 --> 04:06:26,000
Let me kill the small guys first.

4221
04:06:26,940 --> 04:06:28,860
I don't know.

4222
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:31,160
It seems a little hard over there.

4223
04:06:31,420 --> 04:06:32,820
Seems a little difficult.

4224
04:06:33,200 --> 04:06:35,740
I'll get rid of the other mini guys first.

4225
04:06:38,300 --> 04:06:39,140
I'm ready.

4226
04:06:39,420 --> 04:06:40,040
No, I'm ready.

4227
04:06:42,500 --> 04:06:43,120
Let's go!

4228
04:06:45,560 --> 04:06:46,760
Let's go!

4229
04:06:47,540 --> 04:06:48,260
For Doki!

4230
04:06:49,700 --> 04:06:50,900
Okay, um...

4231
04:06:50,900 --> 04:06:51,820
Okay, um...

4232
04:06:53,420 --> 04:06:54,560
Guys, can they charge?

4233
04:06:57,520 --> 04:06:58,820
Alright, that was...

4234
04:06:59,960 --> 04:07:02,080
That was a little anti-climatic.

4235
04:07:02,180 --> 04:07:03,720
Because I thought, you know...

4236
04:07:03,720 --> 04:07:06,720
I legitimately thought that, you know, they'd do more.

4237
04:07:06,880 --> 04:07:07,820
But that's okay.

4238
04:07:10,600 --> 04:07:13,120
I thought they would break down barriers.

4239
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:14,540
But that's okay.

4240
04:07:15,000 --> 04:07:16,100
Like, that's alright.

4241
04:07:16,200 --> 04:07:17,160
Okay, there we go.

4242
04:07:20,940 --> 04:07:21,340
Okay.

4243
04:07:21,940 --> 04:07:22,980
Don't worry, we got it.

4244
04:07:25,840 --> 04:07:27,100
We can both spin.

4245
04:07:28,320 --> 04:07:28,720
Break.

4246
04:07:29,180 --> 04:07:31,120
Reduce Yuen Shu's health by 15%.

4247
04:07:31,840 --> 04:07:32,840
Wait, where is he?

4248
04:07:33,540 --> 04:07:34,360
Wait, where is he?

4249
04:07:34,500 --> 04:07:35,680
Wait, oh my god!

4250
04:07:35,720 --> 04:07:38,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4251
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:41,860
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!

4252
04:07:41,860 --> 04:07:42,920
Wait a minute!

4253
04:07:44,900 --> 04:07:47,120
Wait a minute, where is he at?

4254
04:07:47,280 --> 04:07:48,100
Where is he?

4255
04:07:48,140 --> 04:07:49,660
Okay, we're not gonna make it.

4256
04:07:49,920 --> 04:07:50,880
Bro, okay.

4257
04:07:51,340 --> 04:07:52,380
Bro, how am I...

4258
04:07:52,380 --> 04:07:54,920
How do I make it to him?!

4259
04:07:54,920 --> 04:07:55,860
He's so...

4260
04:07:57,740 --> 04:08:00,960
Like, I'm trying to fucking get to him right now!

4261
04:08:01,240 --> 04:08:04,220
I am trying so hard to get to this guy!

4262
04:08:05,140 --> 04:08:06,400
Oh my god.

4263
04:08:07,320 --> 04:08:09,420
Okay, guys, I don't know about that.

4264
04:08:09,540 --> 04:08:11,700
He is actually trying to run away.

4265
04:08:12,580 --> 04:08:13,600
Oh, no.

4266
04:08:13,800 --> 04:08:14,900
Oh, no.

4267
04:08:14,980 --> 04:08:15,840
Oh, no.

4268
04:08:15,900 --> 04:08:17,080
Oh, we did it!

4269
04:08:17,760 --> 04:08:18,920
Seven seconds!

4270
04:08:20,520 --> 04:08:20,800
Alright.

4271
04:08:22,780 --> 04:08:23,300
That's fine.

4272
04:08:25,420 --> 04:08:27,740
I use the power of Guanyin.

4273
04:08:29,820 --> 04:08:30,480
Nine...

4274
04:08:30,480 --> 04:08:31,860
A thousand?!

4275
04:08:33,280 --> 04:08:37,120
I did it!

4276
04:08:41,300 --> 04:08:44,240
That's actually crazy.

4277
04:08:45,500 --> 04:08:46,880
Wait, where is he running to?

4278
04:08:47,680 --> 04:08:49,260
Yuan Shu, where are you running to?

4279
04:08:49,360 --> 04:08:50,680
Yuan Shu, I'm like right here.

4280
04:08:52,680 --> 04:08:53,340
Oh, shit.

4281
04:08:55,400 --> 04:08:56,080
What the fuck?

4282
04:08:56,200 --> 04:08:56,700
Oh, shit!

4283
04:08:57,960 --> 04:08:58,260
It's okay.

4284
04:08:58,860 --> 04:08:59,260
We're fine.

4285
04:09:01,860 --> 04:09:04,340
I literally just need to get power up.

4286
04:09:06,700 --> 04:09:07,800
Everything will be fine.

4287
04:09:10,060 --> 04:09:10,860
Okay, um...

4288
04:09:10,860 --> 04:09:11,940
Oh, shit!

4289
04:09:12,120 --> 04:09:12,560
Oh, shit!

4290
04:09:12,840 --> 04:09:13,320
Oh, shit!

4291
04:09:13,560 --> 04:09:14,120
Oh, shit!

4292
04:09:14,700 --> 04:09:15,100
Um...

4293
04:09:15,540 --> 04:09:15,940
Um...

4294
04:09:15,940 --> 04:09:17,040
We gotta run.

4295
04:09:17,260 --> 04:09:17,820
We gotta get...

4296
04:09:17,820 --> 04:09:18,300
Okay, bun.

4297
04:09:18,380 --> 04:09:18,800
Bun time.

4298
04:09:18,980 --> 04:09:19,740
I'll be back.

4299
04:09:19,820 --> 04:09:20,380
I'll be back.

4300
04:09:20,460 --> 04:09:20,980
I'll be back.

4301
04:09:21,060 --> 04:09:21,600
I'll be back.

4302
04:09:21,680 --> 04:09:22,620
I'll be...

4303
04:09:26,320 --> 04:09:26,940
Don't worry.

4304
04:09:27,100 --> 04:09:29,040
I just gotta restock on some buns.

4305
04:09:29,580 --> 04:09:30,160
I'll be back.

4306
04:09:30,220 --> 04:09:30,760
I'll be back.

4307
04:09:30,760 --> 04:09:31,380
I'll be back.

4308
04:09:31,400 --> 04:09:31,960
I'll be...

4309
04:09:32,960 --> 04:09:34,060
Where are the buns?

4310
04:09:34,660 --> 04:09:36,020
Where are the buns?

4311
04:09:36,180 --> 04:09:36,880
I'll be back.

4312
04:09:37,740 --> 04:09:38,760
I'll be back.

4313
04:09:41,200 --> 04:09:43,700
Wait, there are buns there?

4314
04:09:43,920 --> 04:09:44,780
Okay, don't worry.

4315
04:09:45,740 --> 04:09:47,040
Don't worry, I'll be okay.

4316
04:09:48,060 --> 04:09:49,020
Oh, there's some buns.

4317
04:09:49,120 --> 04:09:49,660
There's some buns.

4318
04:09:49,740 --> 04:09:50,440
Okay, that's good.

4319
04:09:53,240 --> 04:09:53,740
Alright.

4320
04:09:54,280 --> 04:09:54,800
Round two.

4321
04:09:55,140 --> 04:09:55,920
Snack break's over.

4322
04:09:56,660 --> 04:09:58,240
Guys, snack break is over.

4323
04:09:58,580 --> 04:09:59,360
I'm back.

4324
04:09:59,360 --> 04:10:00,260
I'm back.

4325
04:10:03,560 --> 04:10:05,080
I'm done with snacky break.

4326
04:10:09,380 --> 04:10:09,680
Nice.

4327
04:10:10,560 --> 04:10:11,540
Guys, I did it.

4328
04:10:11,920 --> 04:10:13,320
Sorry, I had to have a snack break.

4329
04:10:13,480 --> 04:10:13,980
But it's okay.

4330
04:10:14,040 --> 04:10:14,700
I'm okay now.

4331
04:10:18,080 --> 04:10:19,900
Alright, I'm back.

4332
04:10:24,840 --> 04:10:25,280
Again?!

4333
04:10:27,900 --> 04:10:29,460
Oh my god.

4334
04:10:31,300 --> 04:10:31,980
Again?!

4335
04:10:31,980 --> 04:10:32,260
Okay.

4336
04:10:34,940 --> 04:10:35,860
Alright, charge through!

4337
04:10:36,220 --> 04:10:37,620
I didn't get the USU!

4338
04:10:37,860 --> 04:10:38,040
Charge!

4339
04:10:39,600 --> 04:10:40,000
Charge!

4340
04:10:40,520 --> 04:10:41,940
I didn't get them!

4341
04:10:44,640 --> 04:10:45,320
Okay.

4342
04:10:46,360 --> 04:10:47,280
We should be close.

4343
04:10:50,320 --> 04:10:53,220
Please, he's running away like a fucking coward!

4344
04:10:57,460 --> 04:10:59,220
Jesus Christ.

4345
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:01,620
Okay, I did it.

4346
04:11:04,040 --> 04:11:04,820
Please, please.

4347
04:11:04,920 --> 04:11:06,580
I have so much to deal with.

4348
04:11:06,640 --> 04:11:08,440
Please, he keeps running away!

4349
04:11:08,660 --> 04:11:09,980
I don't like it!

4350
04:11:11,000 --> 04:11:13,400
He keeps running away.

4351
04:11:14,000 --> 04:11:16,220
I'm trying my best!

4352
04:11:18,940 --> 04:11:20,580
I'm trying!

4353
04:11:22,140 --> 04:11:24,420
He keeps running away!

4354
04:11:26,060 --> 04:11:27,320
I have to!

4355
04:11:30,860 --> 04:11:31,740
Okay.

4356
04:11:32,120 --> 04:11:33,080
It's fine.

4357
04:11:34,320 --> 04:11:36,320
He's looking for butts.

4358
04:11:36,500 --> 04:11:38,620
He's also looking for butts.

4359
04:11:45,160 --> 04:11:46,480
Alright, nice.

4360
04:11:50,340 --> 04:11:52,040
Jesus, fucking finally.

4361
04:11:58,360 --> 04:12:00,120
Oh my god.

4362
04:12:00,220 --> 04:12:01,960
He didn't even finish his dialogue.

4363
04:12:02,200 --> 04:12:03,760
I'm done.

4364
04:12:05,820 --> 04:12:06,460
Yay!

4365
04:12:06,460 --> 04:12:06,640
Yay!

4366
04:12:15,520 --> 04:12:16,760
Yippee!

4367
04:12:23,180 --> 04:12:26,660
Well, time to chop off his hands.

4368
04:12:31,260 --> 04:12:34,360
We did it, guys!

4369
04:12:37,820 --> 04:12:38,220
Okay.

4370
04:12:38,480 --> 04:12:39,660
Got the blade.

4371
04:12:42,760 --> 04:12:43,160
Yippee!

4372
04:12:43,320 --> 04:12:43,740
Level up!

4373
04:12:49,980 --> 04:12:51,120
Okay, plus 93.

4374
04:12:51,280 --> 04:12:52,360
What did I get from that?

4375
04:12:52,980 --> 04:12:56,420
Yeah, I swear to god I have not been leveling up any of these.

4376
04:12:58,540 --> 04:12:59,340
I don't know.

4377
04:12:59,440 --> 04:13:01,080
I don't want to woo any of these people.

4378
04:13:01,680 --> 04:13:03,040
I already paid the win enough.

4379
04:13:04,180 --> 04:13:04,740
Alright, nice.

4380
04:13:04,780 --> 04:13:06,160
We got a ring of light.

4381
04:13:07,800 --> 04:13:09,320
And then we can get increased health.

4382
04:13:10,320 --> 04:13:12,040
And we can get attack later.

4383
04:13:23,640 --> 04:13:24,540
Hello, guys.

4384
04:13:24,920 --> 04:13:25,500
Welcome back.

4385
04:13:39,500 --> 04:13:41,140
What are you flying?

4386
04:13:42,860 --> 04:13:44,400
An actual strategist?

4387
04:14:06,920 --> 04:14:07,500
Okay.

4388
04:14:12,080 --> 04:14:13,380
Yes, they are.

4389
04:14:14,620 --> 04:14:16,520
You are whipped as fuck, Lupe.

4390
04:14:19,380 --> 04:14:23,020
And Lord Luibu's skill in battle is unmatched.

4391
04:14:23,480 --> 04:14:27,040
No talent of mine raises me up above my rivals.

4392
04:14:27,360 --> 04:14:28,180
What talent?

4393
04:14:28,640 --> 04:14:29,740
It's hard to admit.

4394
04:14:30,000 --> 04:14:30,920
You just talk.

4395
04:14:31,080 --> 04:14:32,240
You're just a politician.

4396
04:14:32,780 --> 04:14:33,940
You talk and do nothing.

4397
04:14:34,840 --> 04:14:35,840
What fucking talent?

4398
04:14:36,460 --> 04:14:38,820
I'm only following you for one person.

4399
04:14:39,260 --> 04:14:45,840
If anything, the majority of people will die before they even come close to finding that for themselves.

4400
04:14:45,840 --> 04:14:56,220
Being born into this turbulent world, clinging to a dream, and seeing it through is a privilege only granted to a lucky few.

4401
04:14:57,940 --> 04:14:59,980
Yes, that is certainly true.

4402
04:15:01,180 --> 04:15:03,760
But what do you intend to do in such a world?

4403
04:15:05,220 --> 04:15:05,700
I...

4404
04:15:05,700 --> 04:15:07,460
Are we really letting him lead us?

4405
04:15:07,660 --> 04:15:11,560
I will create a world where people can live as they wish.

4406
04:15:11,600 --> 04:15:12,320
Oh, no.

4407
04:15:12,320 --> 04:15:15,220
A world where no one will be forced to serve the will of another.

4408
04:15:16,120 --> 04:15:22,220
Where all people can choose a path and follow it to a future of their own making.

4409
04:15:24,640 --> 04:15:27,660
But I am still powerless.

4410
04:15:29,240 --> 04:15:33,140
For now, I will be forced to remain under Lord Cao Cao's control.

4411
04:15:33,920 --> 04:15:36,620
Would you still be willing to wait with me?

4412
04:15:37,440 --> 04:15:40,740
To stand by until it is our time to rise?

4413
04:15:40,740 --> 04:15:42,100
Of course.

4414
04:15:42,800 --> 04:15:46,440
How could I oppose this grand pledge you have shown for us?

4415
04:15:46,780 --> 04:15:48,600
I believe in you, brother.

4416
04:15:49,560 --> 04:15:51,480
I will never leave your side.

4417
04:15:52,960 --> 04:15:58,560
As much as I'd like to crush Lui Bu and the others right now, you've convinced me.

4418
04:15:59,320 --> 04:16:00,440
The wait is worth it.

4419
04:16:03,700 --> 04:16:05,180
I'll wait with you, too.

4420
04:16:05,480 --> 04:16:05,840
Thank you.

4421
04:16:06,820 --> 04:16:10,020
It will be hard, but I know we can do it.

4422
04:16:10,020 --> 04:16:14,440
No matter what anyone says, I'll stay true to myself.

4423
04:16:15,300 --> 04:16:17,320
I will do what I believe is right.

4424
04:16:17,880 --> 04:16:18,880
Lui Bu Terry.

4425
04:16:19,480 --> 04:16:21,140
Thank you for the super chat, Ajo.

4426
04:16:21,500 --> 04:16:22,380
Thank you, thank you.

4427
04:16:23,500 --> 04:16:28,640
This stone on the road is about to roll its way to victory.

4428
04:16:30,120 --> 04:16:31,240
Yeah, victory.

4429
04:16:31,640 --> 04:16:33,420
That's what I'm gonna hear from Juca then.

4430
04:16:34,360 --> 04:16:34,920
God.

4431
04:16:36,380 --> 04:16:42,380
If the greatest strategy was not on your side, I'd be peacing out by now.

4432
04:16:43,980 --> 04:16:45,560
I'd be fucking gone.

4433
04:16:49,040 --> 04:16:49,600
Alright.

4434
04:16:50,360 --> 04:16:51,760
What letters do I have?

4435
04:16:51,880 --> 04:16:52,240
Ooh!

4436
04:16:53,800 --> 04:16:55,880
How do I proclaim that our kingdom is under attack?

4437
04:16:56,160 --> 04:16:58,760
All those who will fill the fight must make haste.

4438
04:16:58,840 --> 04:16:59,800
Okay, that was just nothing.

4439
04:17:04,170 --> 04:17:04,570
Alright.

4440
04:17:04,570 --> 04:17:06,170
Are there any other weapons though?

4441
04:17:08,590 --> 04:17:10,010
It's just a spear.

4442
04:17:10,170 --> 04:17:11,410
I wish they have the...

4443
04:17:11,410 --> 04:17:14,090
I really wanna use the hoops.

4444
04:17:14,730 --> 04:17:15,610
Alright, Guan Yin.

4445
04:17:16,270 --> 04:17:16,610
Whoops.

4446
04:17:17,930 --> 04:17:18,990
What do you wanna talk about?

4447
04:17:30,290 --> 04:17:32,270
I was serious when I said I'd wait.

4448
04:17:32,930 --> 04:17:35,650
But I don't think I can stomach Lui Bu for much longer.

4449
04:17:38,010 --> 04:17:39,610
He is a beast by nature.

4450
04:17:40,470 --> 04:17:42,370
He will run wild as he pleases.

4451
04:17:43,510 --> 04:17:49,430
The way he wields his power to consume all in his path reminds me of Dan Shua.

4452
04:17:52,490 --> 04:17:54,330
He isn't that bad, guys.

4453
04:17:54,510 --> 04:17:56,690
Like, he treats me okay.

4454
04:17:57,570 --> 04:17:57,890
What?

4455
04:17:58,030 --> 04:18:00,510
So you're saying you see something good in that brute?

4456
04:18:01,210 --> 04:18:02,510
I mean, he bought me dinner.

4457
04:18:02,990 --> 04:18:03,990
You've never been on good terms with Lui Bu.

4458
04:18:04,830 --> 04:18:07,270
Even I have nothing to say in his defense.

4459
04:18:07,270 --> 04:18:16,030
Nonetheless, as long as our brother hasn't lost his will to fight, I will always be right behind him.

4460
04:18:16,030 --> 04:18:17,090
But he treats me okay!

4461
04:18:17,750 --> 04:18:20,690
Even Zhang Fei is starting to lose heart.

4462
04:18:21,910 --> 04:18:25,590
How much longer can we expect the others to hold on?

4463
04:18:30,050 --> 04:18:32,690
Everyone, please make haste to the war room!

4464
04:18:33,470 --> 04:18:35,330
What's all the excitement about?

4465
04:18:36,470 --> 04:18:37,690
Lui Bu's forces.

4466
04:18:38,070 --> 04:18:38,510
Again?

4467
04:18:39,350 --> 04:18:39,610
What?

4468
04:18:40,730 --> 04:18:41,650
How are they invading?

4469
04:18:42,290 --> 04:18:43,970
We just got out of a war!

4470
04:18:48,740 --> 04:18:51,320
Oh my God, there's another fucking battle.

4471
04:18:53,820 --> 04:18:58,480
I request your help from all over in far too many tasks rooting me in place, which is where you come in.

4472
04:18:59,120 --> 04:18:59,420
Alright.

4473
04:18:59,920 --> 04:19:02,280
I'll show Lord Liu Bei what I'm made of.

4474
04:19:02,400 --> 04:19:06,320
Alright guys, before I do this, I'm gonna go microwave some food because I haven't had lunch yet.

4475
04:19:06,320 --> 04:19:08,080
And it's 5pm.

4476
04:19:08,320 --> 04:19:09,680
I'll be right back.

4477
04:19:09,820 --> 04:19:11,500
I'm just gonna microwave food real quick.

4478
04:22:00,060 --> 04:22:00,580
Alright.

4479
04:22:01,180 --> 04:22:02,260
I got my food.

4480
04:22:03,220 --> 04:22:04,680
I microwaved some food.

4481
04:22:04,840 --> 04:22:06,020
Some rice and meat.

4482
04:22:08,620 --> 04:22:09,140
Okay.

4483
04:22:10,060 --> 04:22:14,440
Goddamnit, I wish there was a war so I could just eat while we listen to some fucking Riz.

4484
04:22:14,920 --> 04:22:21,440
I thought I had more Riz to go through.

4485
04:22:21,920 --> 04:22:23,340
Alright, maybe I do.

4486
04:22:23,560 --> 04:22:24,200
Give me a sec.

4487
04:22:24,320 --> 04:22:26,380
Alright, let's see if we can find anybody to talk to.

4488
04:22:28,120 --> 04:22:30,960
There has to be some guy that wants to talk to me.

4489
04:22:31,440 --> 04:22:32,780
While I'm trying to eat.

4490
04:22:33,620 --> 04:22:35,520
There has to be somebody.

4491
04:22:37,200 --> 04:22:37,660
Alright.

4492
04:22:39,660 --> 04:22:43,220
Let's go home and see if there's anybody that wants to talk to me.

4493
04:22:45,460 --> 04:22:46,700
Alright, here we go.

4494
04:22:50,000 --> 04:22:50,560
Alright.

4495
04:22:53,460 --> 04:22:54,020
Interaction.

4496
04:22:54,440 --> 04:22:56,520
Goddamnit, why does no one want to talk to me?

4497
04:22:56,520 --> 04:22:56,780
Please!

4498
04:22:58,480 --> 04:23:00,700
How else am I gonna fucking eat?

4499
04:23:01,140 --> 04:23:04,260
I need somebody to talk to me.

4500
04:23:04,400 --> 04:23:04,720
Okay.

4501
04:23:05,680 --> 04:23:07,260
Where do I acquire this?

4502
04:23:08,020 --> 04:23:10,300
Alright, let's find this little shit.

4503
04:23:10,540 --> 04:23:11,420
And then like...

4504
04:23:11,420 --> 04:23:12,720
Then we have a cutscene.

4505
04:23:13,500 --> 04:23:14,480
And I can eat.

4506
04:23:15,940 --> 04:23:16,680
I forgot what I was doing.

4507
04:23:16,680 --> 04:23:18,400
I forgot where this little thing is.

4508
04:23:19,240 --> 04:23:20,780
Okay, it's in the Yang province.

4509
04:23:20,940 --> 04:23:22,360
Alright, let's find Yang province.

4510
04:23:31,320 --> 04:23:33,260
Where the fuck is Yang?

4511
04:23:39,500 --> 04:23:42,420
Wait, is there no bottom right here?

4512
04:23:42,580 --> 04:23:43,300
Is this all Yang?

4513
04:23:43,300 --> 04:23:44,200
Wait, do I not...

4514
04:23:44,200 --> 04:23:47,600
Have I not unlocked any area there?

4515
04:23:50,960 --> 04:23:52,820
Did I forgot to unlock anything?

4516
04:23:56,040 --> 04:23:58,040
Oh my god, I did.

4517
04:24:00,400 --> 04:24:02,920
Are there no markers anywhere for this area?

4518
04:24:05,100 --> 04:24:06,420
Oh, that's bad.

4519
04:24:08,820 --> 04:24:10,760
Wait, there's no markers here.

4520
04:24:16,400 --> 04:24:19,360
There has to be a single fucking marker here somewhere.

4521
04:24:22,120 --> 04:24:23,340
I'm still in Yang, right?

4522
04:24:23,440 --> 04:24:24,840
Oh my god, this is a huge territory.

4523
04:24:31,970 --> 04:24:34,270
There has to be one marker here.

4524
04:24:34,770 --> 04:24:35,670
Like, one.

4525
04:24:37,090 --> 04:24:38,290
That's alright, there's a lot of coins.

4526
04:24:39,570 --> 04:24:39,970
Nice.

4527
04:24:44,750 --> 04:24:46,610
Where the fuck is my grass?

4528
04:24:51,520 --> 04:24:53,700
Oh my god, there's no grass anywhere.

4529
04:24:54,500 --> 04:24:55,800
Oh, there it is, there's a marker.

4530
04:24:55,900 --> 04:24:56,720
Okay, there you go.

4531
04:24:57,220 --> 04:24:57,760
There's still a...

4532
04:24:57,760 --> 04:24:59,180
There you go, that's what we needed.

4533
04:24:59,740 --> 04:25:01,180
Alright, and then we unlock here.

4534
04:25:04,920 --> 04:25:06,520
Oh my god, we finally found it.

4535
04:25:06,540 --> 04:25:08,800
It's been like 20 years and we finally found it.

4536
04:25:09,760 --> 04:25:12,620
Alright, time to talk to my doctor so I can eat.

4537
04:25:14,700 --> 04:25:15,620
Doctor, doctor.

4538
04:25:15,980 --> 04:25:17,280
I have the last incense.

4539
04:25:21,560 --> 04:25:22,000
Alright.

4540
04:25:23,440 --> 04:25:25,580
Alright, time to go to the village.

4541
04:25:25,760 --> 04:25:26,700
Light that shit up.

4542
04:25:27,680 --> 04:25:28,680
And I can eat now.

4543
04:25:29,600 --> 04:25:30,780
Oh shit, I'm surrounded.

4544
04:25:38,040 --> 04:25:40,460
I swear to god, this is like a fucking one minute cutscene.

4545
04:25:40,540 --> 04:25:41,240
I swear to god.

4546
04:25:43,340 --> 04:25:43,680
Shit.

4547
04:25:53,900 --> 04:25:55,260
An informant.

4548
04:25:56,240 --> 04:25:59,000
Perhaps someone who disagreed with the position you took.

4549
04:26:26,690 --> 04:26:27,710
Now listen.

4550
04:26:28,290 --> 04:26:30,390
I am the strongest fighter in this village.

4551
04:26:30,850 --> 04:26:32,690
And you two will only get in my way.

4552
04:26:33,370 --> 04:26:35,050
Do not try to follow me.

4553
04:26:35,830 --> 04:26:37,510
You have to live, Silouan.

4554
04:26:38,250 --> 04:26:41,430
Live, and create the world we dreamed of.

4555
04:26:43,650 --> 04:26:44,770
Chua, wait!

4556
04:26:45,550 --> 04:26:46,430
Foolish girl.

4557
04:26:48,130 --> 04:26:49,730
Silouan, after her.

4558
04:26:50,250 --> 04:26:52,430
I cannot fly with only one of my wings.

4559
04:26:52,950 --> 04:26:54,090
We have to save her.

4560
04:27:07,600 --> 04:27:10,100
Chua entrusted you with her dream.

4561
04:27:11,460 --> 04:27:14,740
She knew she would never be able to realize that dream.

4562
04:27:15,560 --> 04:27:18,580
Yet she believed you would make it come to pass.

4563
04:27:19,460 --> 04:27:22,520
Perhaps my father believed something similar.

4564
04:27:23,380 --> 04:27:27,460
But Chua survived, and she appeared before you.

4565
04:27:28,380 --> 04:27:30,680
Does that mean...

4566
04:27:30,680 --> 04:27:31,320
No.

4567
04:27:33,000 --> 04:27:34,020
He couldn't.

4568
04:27:35,020 --> 04:27:37,040
Things are drawing to a close, Silouan.

4569
04:27:37,740 --> 04:27:40,260
And I will be at your side until the end.

4570
04:27:53,920 --> 04:27:54,940
That's it?

4571
04:27:55,540 --> 04:27:56,080
That's it?

4572
04:27:57,020 --> 04:27:57,780
What the fuck?

4573
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:00,640
I tried it.

4574
04:28:01,680 --> 04:28:02,660
I barely ate.

4575
04:28:05,880 --> 04:28:06,940
That's it?

4576
04:28:07,520 --> 04:28:08,920
Alright, I'm fighting one more.

4577
04:28:09,880 --> 04:28:10,160
No!

4578
04:28:13,600 --> 04:28:15,400
Oh my god.

4579
04:28:17,840 --> 04:28:19,220
This is not fair.

4580
04:28:20,760 --> 04:28:22,180
This is not fair.

4581
04:28:22,280 --> 04:28:23,740
I risked too much.

4582
04:28:23,860 --> 04:28:26,600
I risked too much and there's nothing left to risk.

4583
04:28:27,060 --> 04:28:27,740
No!

4584
04:28:29,440 --> 04:28:32,040
There's nothing left to risk.

4585
04:28:32,500 --> 04:28:33,940
I did too much.

4586
04:28:36,580 --> 04:28:37,260
Goddammit.

4587
04:28:38,440 --> 04:28:38,760
Alright.

4588
04:28:40,480 --> 04:28:42,740
You guys read for me while I finish eating.

4589
04:28:45,080 --> 04:28:45,760
No!

4590
04:28:45,760 --> 04:28:46,100
Goddamn!

4591
04:28:47,480 --> 04:28:49,240
I risked too much!

4592
04:28:49,920 --> 04:28:50,420
Alright, nice.

4593
04:28:50,800 --> 04:28:51,500
Cut scenes.

4594
04:29:17,220 --> 04:29:21,060
It is difficult to believe that Lord Cao Cao would be so careless.

4595
04:29:21,760 --> 04:29:26,280
I suspect he intentionally allowed the enemy to intercept the letter.

4596
04:29:27,260 --> 04:29:31,320
Still, it's not like we wrote back accepting Cao Cao's proposal.

4597
04:29:33,240 --> 04:29:35,680
Chengu must be trying to get ahead of things.

4598
04:29:36,440 --> 04:29:42,320
But that doesn't make attacking an ally before trying to negotiate any less dishonorable.

4599
04:29:43,440 --> 04:29:45,200
This must be Lord Lu Bu's answer.

4600
04:29:47,220 --> 04:29:51,800
In the world he wants to create, there is no honor or compassion.

4601
04:29:52,640 --> 04:29:57,760
It is a world of beasts, where the strong simply devour the weak.

4602
04:29:58,600 --> 04:30:01,880
It is totally incompatible with everything I want to achieve.

4603
04:30:03,140 --> 04:30:07,360
The time has come for us to break free from Lu Bu.

4604
04:30:08,280 --> 04:30:12,080
But our forces alone do not stand a chance against him.

4605
04:30:12,620 --> 04:30:13,880
What will we do, brother?

4606
04:30:14,380 --> 04:30:18,200
We will abandon Xiao Pei and join forces with Cao Cao's army.

4607
04:30:19,620 --> 04:30:21,300
Lu Bu will be no match for us together.

4608
04:30:22,400 --> 04:30:25,460
I'm sure you each have your misgivings about Lord Cao Cao.

4609
04:30:26,300 --> 04:30:29,660
But for now, think of him as a means to an end.

4610
04:30:38,620 --> 04:30:41,120
Yeah, I was on board from the start.

4611
04:30:41,540 --> 04:30:45,360
As long as we get to crush Lu Bu, you won't hear me complaining.

4612
04:30:46,820 --> 04:30:52,700
No matter who offers us help or favors, it will never come at the cost of my soul.

4613
04:30:53,500 --> 04:30:58,240
I will subdue and consume all who would look down upon us.

4614
04:30:59,500 --> 04:31:03,440
Neither strength nor reason will bring an end to the chaos.

4615
04:31:04,200 --> 04:31:07,600
And it's up to us to prove it to the world.

4616
04:31:14,560 --> 04:31:15,520
Shall we start?

4617
04:31:30,510 --> 04:31:31,830
I'd say so.

4618
04:31:32,470 --> 04:31:33,150
Aye.

4619
04:32:20,330 --> 04:32:20,650
I hate it.

4620
04:32:21,210 --> 04:32:24,530
It's a sacrifice I make for Dynasty Warriors.

4621
04:32:29,640 --> 04:32:30,280
Hmm.

4622
04:32:34,540 --> 04:32:35,660
You were too fast to read?

4623
04:32:36,940 --> 04:32:37,820
That's okay.

4624
04:32:43,660 --> 04:32:45,980
I don't need to read for his strategies.

4625
04:32:48,500 --> 04:32:50,620
Lu Bei is literally just Ongabunga.

4626
04:32:50,820 --> 04:32:51,640
Like, what strategy?

4627
04:32:51,640 --> 04:32:57,780
You really need to know the War Council when everything is just head straight there and then see if it works.

4628
04:32:59,640 --> 04:33:02,160
Like, he has not changed his strategy once.

4629
04:33:02,440 --> 04:33:03,940
Like, I don't need to reread it.

4630
04:33:05,160 --> 04:33:06,260
It's the same thing.

4631
04:33:12,300 --> 04:33:14,040
He's literally like, charge ahead.

4632
04:33:14,600 --> 04:33:15,380
I'm like, okay.

4633
04:33:20,220 --> 04:33:23,500
I don't need a... I don't need strategy for that.

4634
04:33:24,280 --> 04:33:25,660
I just lost him.

4635
04:33:28,340 --> 04:33:28,960
Alright.

4636
04:33:29,580 --> 04:33:30,600
Let's go!

4637
04:33:31,220 --> 04:33:34,460
Alright, here we go.

4638
04:33:35,060 --> 04:33:35,540
Get in battle.

4639
04:33:41,120 --> 04:33:42,580
Alright, hide my meal.

4640
04:33:42,880 --> 04:33:44,160
I'm full now.

4641
04:33:46,920 --> 04:33:47,420
Where am I?

4642
04:33:48,280 --> 04:33:49,580
Where am I?

4643
04:33:53,580 --> 04:33:54,060
Spin!

4644
04:34:02,020 --> 04:34:04,060
What the fuck were you trying to do?

4645
04:34:05,000 --> 04:34:05,480
Like...

4646
04:34:05,480 --> 04:34:07,400
Were you trying to do your own spin?

4647
04:34:07,700 --> 04:34:08,960
Do you know who I am?

4648
04:34:11,120 --> 04:34:11,780
That's right.

4649
04:34:11,840 --> 04:34:12,960
No spinning for you.

4650
04:34:13,080 --> 04:34:14,060
Get out of here.

4651
04:34:24,620 --> 04:34:25,700
Alright, let's get over here.

4652
04:34:29,520 --> 04:34:30,440
Wait, where is he?

4653
04:34:30,720 --> 04:34:31,740
Wait, where is Lupe?

4654
04:34:32,400 --> 04:34:34,600
I don't even... Wait, okay.

4655
04:34:34,700 --> 04:34:35,740
Where is he anyway?

4656
04:34:35,840 --> 04:34:37,320
Oh, he's all the way down here.

4657
04:34:37,400 --> 04:34:39,180
Okay, I was clearly not paying attention.

4658
04:34:40,000 --> 04:34:42,480
Alright, maybe I should have paid attention to the War Council.

4659
04:34:44,080 --> 04:34:45,280
Nah, he'll be fine.

4660
04:34:45,800 --> 04:34:46,880
Lupe should be fine, right?

4661
04:34:51,360 --> 04:34:52,440
He'll be fine.

4662
04:34:57,380 --> 04:34:57,820
Okay.

4663
04:34:59,740 --> 04:35:00,040
Okay, don't worry.

4664
04:35:02,120 --> 04:35:03,840
I can just... Wait.

4665
04:35:04,780 --> 04:35:05,840
He doesn't need me?

4666
04:35:10,280 --> 04:35:11,760
I can't even go there.

4667
04:35:12,640 --> 04:35:13,940
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's blocked.

4668
04:35:19,680 --> 04:35:20,120
Spin!

4669
04:35:20,300 --> 04:35:22,760
Oh my god, he can just run away from my spin like that?

4670
04:35:32,300 --> 04:35:32,660
Okay.

4671
04:35:32,660 --> 04:35:32,740
Don't worry.

4672
04:35:32,740 --> 04:35:32,840
Don't worry.

4673
04:35:32,900 --> 04:35:33,140
Don't worry.

4674
04:35:33,320 --> 04:35:33,560
Don't worry.

4675
04:35:35,080 --> 04:35:35,860
He'll be fine.

4676
04:35:37,360 --> 04:35:38,420
I still own this area.

4677
04:35:38,640 --> 04:35:39,560
I still own this base.

4678
04:35:39,640 --> 04:35:40,320
It'll be fine.

4679
04:35:47,780 --> 04:35:48,580
Okay, don't worry.

4680
04:35:48,740 --> 04:35:49,560
Everything is okay.

4681
04:35:49,680 --> 04:35:50,740
I still own this house.

4682
04:35:56,740 --> 04:35:57,700
Get out!

4683
04:36:02,660 --> 04:36:03,820
Get out!

4684
04:36:09,800 --> 04:36:10,840
That's right!

4685
04:36:12,000 --> 04:36:13,800
Get out of my house!

4686
04:36:14,560 --> 04:36:16,000
That is so easy.

4687
04:36:17,080 --> 04:36:18,500
Oh shit, okay, we gotta...

4688
04:36:19,500 --> 04:36:21,520
Wait, what do I... Okay, do I need to help him?

4689
04:36:21,760 --> 04:36:22,780
Nah, he'll be fine.

4690
04:36:24,060 --> 04:36:27,840
I need to save my sworn brothers who stayed behind to keep the enemy at bay.

4691
04:36:28,600 --> 04:36:29,860
Then you keep going.

4692
04:36:30,720 --> 04:36:32,920
We'll take care of rescuing your brothers.

4693
04:36:33,600 --> 04:36:34,500
They'll be fine.

4694
04:36:34,560 --> 04:36:35,320
I believe in them.

4695
04:36:37,140 --> 04:36:38,820
Then I will do as you say.

4696
04:36:39,620 --> 04:36:40,760
I'm counting on you.

4697
04:36:41,420 --> 04:36:42,240
Alright, I'm here now.

4698
04:36:43,120 --> 04:36:43,480
Hello!

4699
04:36:45,740 --> 04:36:47,840
Don't worry, I can take them all down.

4700
04:36:50,080 --> 04:36:52,680
I literally killed three armies today.

4701
04:36:53,500 --> 04:36:55,660
What's another army to me?

4702
04:37:00,720 --> 04:37:01,320
Alright.

4703
04:37:07,140 --> 04:37:08,460
Why do you still have two eyes?

4704
04:37:10,380 --> 04:37:13,420
Why has no one shot you in the eye yet?

4705
04:37:15,740 --> 04:37:17,960
Why are you still not that sexy?

4706
04:37:19,680 --> 04:37:21,120
Wait, no, he does have one eye.

4707
04:37:21,200 --> 04:37:23,580
Wait, wait, no, when did he shoot... Wait, no, he has one eye.

4708
04:37:24,020 --> 04:37:25,960
Wait a minute, and I wasn't there?!

4709
04:37:27,300 --> 04:37:30,360
They shot your eye and I wasn't there?!

4710
04:37:30,360 --> 04:37:31,760
I can't believe it!

4711
04:37:32,960 --> 04:37:34,020
I'm so sad.

4712
04:37:35,400 --> 04:37:37,540
Right before... Oh, I can't believe it.

4713
04:37:38,940 --> 04:37:40,120
He didn't invite me.

4714
04:37:41,220 --> 04:37:43,280
He didn't invite me to watch him eat his own eye.

4715
04:37:43,500 --> 04:37:44,320
I'm so sad.

4716
04:37:45,080 --> 04:37:45,920
What's the point?

4717
04:37:48,180 --> 04:37:50,780
Like, what's the point if I can't even be there?

4718
04:37:53,520 --> 04:37:54,240
Nice, goodbye.

4719
04:38:05,100 --> 04:38:06,500
Wait, who's they?

4720
04:38:06,780 --> 04:38:07,520
Who's that guy?

4721
04:38:08,260 --> 04:38:09,980
He just came out of nowhere.

4722
04:38:12,380 --> 04:38:13,180
Alright, let's duel.

4723
04:38:14,560 --> 04:38:15,440
I'm ready.

4724
04:38:17,440 --> 04:38:18,660
Alright, give me a sec.

4725
04:38:18,840 --> 04:38:20,340
Oh wait, actually I should use this one.

4726
04:38:22,260 --> 04:38:26,340
Let me swap to my other weapon first, but then I realized...

4727
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:29,400
Like, I have to use this one because it's just so much stronger.

4728
04:38:30,800 --> 04:38:31,680
Alright, get over here.

4729
04:38:31,720 --> 04:38:32,540
I need to win one more duel.

4730
04:38:34,320 --> 04:38:34,720
Okay.

4731
04:38:36,820 --> 04:38:37,620
Almost done.

4732
04:38:38,780 --> 04:38:39,620
Get over here.

4733
04:38:41,640 --> 04:38:42,280
That's right.

4734
04:38:43,460 --> 04:38:44,500
And you lose the duel.

4735
04:38:45,440 --> 04:38:46,800
Not even one hit.

4736
04:38:47,000 --> 04:38:48,180
I completed his training.

4737
04:38:49,600 --> 04:38:50,080
Look at that.

4738
04:38:50,980 --> 04:38:53,620
I'm here to kill Lu Bu and I completed his training.

4739
04:38:54,660 --> 04:38:56,680
Killed two birds with one stone.

4740
04:38:58,740 --> 04:39:01,240
It's the dragoon's destiny, exactly.

4741
04:39:08,520 --> 04:39:08,920
Really?

4742
04:39:08,920 --> 04:39:12,280
How are you scared, Lu Bu?

4743
04:39:12,760 --> 04:39:13,680
I've been...

4744
04:39:13,680 --> 04:39:14,860
This is not my first war.

4745
04:39:15,080 --> 04:39:16,120
This is not my first war.

4746
04:39:16,160 --> 04:39:17,820
This is not my first war that you poorly planned.

4747
04:39:20,000 --> 04:39:24,380
And yet I've somehow reigned supreme in every poorly planned fight you got me into.

4748
04:39:27,360 --> 04:39:28,360
Where is Guan Yun?

4749
04:39:28,440 --> 04:39:29,660
I thought he was going to be with me.

4750
04:39:31,800 --> 04:39:33,340
Let's move on.

4751
04:39:34,300 --> 04:39:35,120
Time to act.

4752
04:39:36,560 --> 04:39:36,940
Okay,

4753
04:39:41,400 --> 04:39:42,000
one last hit.

4754
04:39:42,340 --> 04:39:42,880
One last hit.

4755
04:39:42,960 --> 04:39:43,420
He's one hit.

4756
04:39:43,500 --> 04:39:44,020
He's one hit.

4757
04:39:44,340 --> 04:39:44,820
Get over here.

4758
04:39:46,500 --> 04:39:46,880
Nice.

4759
04:39:47,340 --> 04:39:49,560
The enemy officer has been defeated.

4760
04:39:50,140 --> 04:39:51,040
Wait, who's over there?

4761
04:39:51,280 --> 04:39:51,700
Is that...

4762
04:39:51,700 --> 04:39:53,960
The party's already started.

4763
04:39:54,700 --> 04:39:55,840
Wait, is that Lu Bei down there?

4764
04:39:55,960 --> 04:39:57,000
Lu Bei, what the fuck are you doing?

4765
04:39:57,040 --> 04:39:57,780
Follow them.

4766
04:40:00,040 --> 04:40:01,200
Lu Bei, what the fuck?

4767
04:40:01,200 --> 04:40:02,320
Oh wait, that's Xiao Hu Dan.

4768
04:40:02,440 --> 04:40:03,120
Okay, nevermind.

4769
04:40:03,420 --> 04:40:04,240
I don't care.

4770
04:40:07,980 --> 04:40:08,760
That's okay.

4771
04:40:08,920 --> 04:40:14,880
You didn't... He didn't invite me to the eye eating, so I don't care anymore.

4772
04:40:16,540 --> 04:40:17,560
I don't care.

4773
04:40:18,060 --> 04:40:19,760
I don't care about him anymore.

4774
04:40:21,020 --> 04:40:25,040
He didn't invite me to an important day of his life.

4775
04:40:26,200 --> 04:40:27,460
So, who cares?

4776
04:40:27,520 --> 04:40:28,420
Who cares about him?

4777
04:40:31,200 --> 04:40:32,600
Alright, let's get rid of these guys.

4778
04:40:37,060 --> 04:40:38,260
I feel so betrayed.

4779
04:40:39,100 --> 04:40:42,520
It was a pivotal part of his life and I wasn't even invited.

4780
04:40:43,400 --> 04:40:44,460
Like, what's the point?

4781
04:40:45,840 --> 04:40:46,820
Did I kill him?

4782
04:40:46,980 --> 04:40:47,580
Oh, I did.

4783
04:40:47,720 --> 04:40:49,580
The enemy officer has been defeated.

4784
04:40:51,660 --> 04:40:52,180
They're all dead?

4785
04:40:52,480 --> 04:40:52,760
Nice.

4786
04:40:52,780 --> 04:40:53,560
Now we can break through.

4787
04:40:54,140 --> 04:40:54,800
Let's move.

4788
04:40:55,220 --> 04:40:55,700
Quickly.

4789
04:40:56,220 --> 04:40:56,520
Alright.

4790
04:40:57,660 --> 04:40:59,600
I'll go to Zhang Fei and Lu Bei.

4791
04:41:01,200 --> 04:41:02,580
Oh wait, I...

4792
04:41:02,580 --> 04:41:07,300
Oh, I created... I ditched the brothers and made them run with the others.

4793
04:41:09,960 --> 04:41:10,860
You know what?

4794
04:41:10,900 --> 04:41:13,000
I believe in Guan Yun and Zhang Fei.

4795
04:41:13,360 --> 04:41:14,100
That's fine.

4796
04:41:15,560 --> 04:41:16,240
That's fine.

4797
04:41:18,280 --> 04:41:19,280
No, it's okay.

4798
04:41:19,460 --> 04:41:20,160
We did it.

4799
04:41:21,900 --> 04:41:23,200
We'll leave them...

4800
04:41:24,520 --> 04:41:25,560
Oh, goddammit.

4801
04:41:25,600 --> 04:41:26,300
Are we really?

4802
04:41:27,260 --> 04:41:30,120
Do we have to... Oh my god.

4803
04:41:30,120 --> 04:41:33,360
We have to... Okay, I guess I'll go back.

4804
04:41:36,220 --> 04:41:37,380
That's fine.

4805
04:41:37,520 --> 04:41:38,420
I'll open the door.

4806
04:41:38,960 --> 04:41:40,040
I'll go from behind.

4807
04:41:41,080 --> 04:41:42,160
Open the door.

4808
04:41:42,920 --> 04:41:44,680
Don't worry, I'll go from behind.

4809
04:41:49,040 --> 04:41:50,000
It's okay.

4810
04:41:51,220 --> 04:41:52,600
They won't expect it.

4811
04:41:54,720 --> 04:41:55,600
Wait, what?

4812
04:41:56,100 --> 04:41:56,700
Bro, what?

4813
04:41:57,120 --> 04:41:57,700
Bro, what?

4814
04:41:57,700 --> 04:41:59,480
What do you mean?

4815
04:42:00,300 --> 04:42:01,480
Lu Bei's not even here.

4816
04:42:01,680 --> 04:42:02,700
It's just me.

4817
04:42:06,780 --> 04:42:08,960
Alright, I've opened the back doors.

4818
04:42:11,340 --> 04:42:11,700
Alright.

4819
04:42:13,820 --> 04:42:14,860
Oh, shit.

4820
04:42:15,060 --> 04:42:15,800
Okay, um...

4821
04:42:18,140 --> 04:42:20,160
This might've been a bad idea.

4822
04:42:20,740 --> 04:42:22,960
Going from the back.

4823
04:42:23,760 --> 04:42:24,280
Guys.

4824
04:42:25,500 --> 04:42:25,980
I don't...

4825
04:42:25,980 --> 04:42:28,040
It might've been a bad idea.

4826
04:42:28,120 --> 04:42:28,740
I'm not sure yet.

4827
04:42:28,800 --> 04:42:29,560
I'm not sure yet.

4828
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:30,700
I'm not sure yet.

4829
04:42:30,700 --> 04:42:31,360
We'll see.

4830
04:42:31,420 --> 04:42:32,140
We'll see from here.

4831
04:42:32,500 --> 04:42:34,240
We'll see from here if he lives.

4832
04:42:39,660 --> 04:42:40,600
Alright, it's fine.

4833
04:42:41,700 --> 04:42:44,660
I just need to claim this base and then everything will be fine.

4834
04:42:46,360 --> 04:42:47,480
They're not that strong.

4835
04:42:47,580 --> 04:42:48,800
They're not that strong, I believe.

4836
04:42:50,340 --> 04:42:51,520
I think I can get him.

4837
04:42:51,560 --> 04:42:52,320
They're not that strong.

4838
04:42:52,500 --> 04:42:52,640
Yeah.

4839
04:42:53,020 --> 04:42:53,680
Yeah, see?

4840
04:42:55,340 --> 04:42:56,300
I'm almost there.

4841
04:42:59,260 --> 04:42:59,980
Last one.

4842
04:43:04,760 --> 04:43:05,420
There you go.

4843
04:43:05,740 --> 04:43:06,100
See?

4844
04:43:06,260 --> 04:43:06,700
There you go.

4845
04:43:06,740 --> 04:43:07,140
We got it.

4846
04:43:07,180 --> 04:43:07,980
We can save him.

4847
04:43:09,040 --> 04:43:09,920
We can save him.

4848
04:43:09,960 --> 04:43:10,720
We can save him.

4849
04:43:10,820 --> 04:43:11,260
It's fine.

4850
04:43:11,940 --> 04:43:12,480
Open the door.

4851
04:43:12,580 --> 04:43:13,080
Open the door.

4852
04:43:13,180 --> 04:43:13,720
Open the door.

4853
04:43:13,800 --> 04:43:14,300
Open the door.

4854
04:43:14,420 --> 04:43:15,100
I'm coming over.

4855
04:43:15,180 --> 04:43:15,620
I'm coming over.

4856
04:43:15,800 --> 04:43:16,260
Don't worry.

4857
04:43:16,380 --> 04:43:16,760
Don't worry.

4858
04:43:16,920 --> 04:43:17,400
It's fine.

4859
04:43:17,460 --> 04:43:17,940
It's fine.

4860
04:43:18,400 --> 04:43:19,060
It's saveable.

4861
04:43:19,200 --> 04:43:19,780
It's saveable.

4862
04:43:20,000 --> 04:43:20,140
See?

4863
04:43:20,260 --> 04:43:20,580
Look at that.

4864
04:43:20,660 --> 04:43:20,840
See?

4865
04:43:21,060 --> 04:43:22,060
Oh, look at that.

4866
04:43:22,060 --> 04:43:23,220
Wait, who?

4867
04:43:24,160 --> 04:43:24,640
Who?

4868
04:43:25,480 --> 04:43:25,820
Who?

4869
04:43:26,340 --> 04:43:26,820
Who?

4870
04:43:26,960 --> 04:43:27,180
Who?

4871
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:28,360
Who just challenged me?

4872
04:43:28,940 --> 04:43:29,960
What the fuck?

4873
04:43:30,020 --> 04:43:31,760
Who challenged... Bro, you're one hit.

4874
04:43:32,060 --> 04:43:32,820
Get out.

4875
04:43:36,200 --> 04:43:37,760
You literally won it.

4876
04:43:37,840 --> 04:43:38,780
Okay, Guan Yin is fine.

4877
04:43:38,840 --> 04:43:39,440
Look, he's okay.

4878
04:43:39,520 --> 04:43:39,960
He's okay.

4879
04:43:40,040 --> 04:43:41,020
Okay, I saved him.

4880
04:43:44,100 --> 04:43:44,320
See?

4881
04:43:44,440 --> 04:43:44,960
Look at that.

4882
04:43:45,120 --> 04:43:46,400
Everything is fine.

4883
04:43:47,320 --> 04:43:48,120
Save what?

4884
04:43:48,220 --> 04:43:48,880
Yeah, they're winning.

4885
04:43:52,080 --> 04:43:53,060
Look at that.

4886
04:43:53,160 --> 04:43:53,880
They were winning.

4887
04:43:54,380 --> 04:43:55,400
He didn't need saving.

4888
04:43:58,520 --> 04:43:59,180
Look at that.

4889
04:43:59,200 --> 04:44:00,000
He's so healthy.

4890
04:44:03,400 --> 04:44:03,860
Okay.

4891
04:44:04,920 --> 04:44:07,940
Oh, you're not that... You're not that strong anymore.

4892
04:44:09,080 --> 04:44:10,200
Oh shit.

4893
04:44:10,600 --> 04:44:11,320
Oh my god.

4894
04:44:11,680 --> 04:44:11,940
See?

4895
04:44:12,060 --> 04:44:12,420
Look at that.

4896
04:44:12,840 --> 04:44:13,980
Not that scared.

4897
04:44:17,860 --> 04:44:18,420
Boop.

4898
04:44:19,020 --> 04:44:19,580
Did I hit him?

4899
04:44:19,740 --> 04:44:20,600
Oh, I did.

4900
04:44:23,220 --> 04:44:23,820
Nice.

4901
04:44:24,740 --> 04:44:24,820
Alright.

4902
04:44:25,520 --> 04:44:27,440
You're 1 HP, little guy.

4903
04:44:27,980 --> 04:44:29,220
You know what that means?

4904
04:44:35,880 --> 04:44:36,480
Goodbye.

4905
04:44:43,920 --> 04:44:44,520
See?

4906
04:44:45,980 --> 04:44:46,820
It's that easy.

4907
04:44:46,880 --> 04:44:48,820
I told you guys I can do it.

4908
04:44:49,340 --> 04:44:50,660
We found the back door.

4909
04:44:53,700 --> 04:44:55,360
Justkida, thank you for the super chat.

4910
04:44:55,440 --> 04:44:55,740
Thank you.

4911
04:44:55,800 --> 04:44:56,340
Thank you.

4912
04:44:56,400 --> 04:44:57,600
She's Xiaohu's gunwoman.

4913
04:44:57,780 --> 04:44:58,820
I'm stealing from chat.

4914
04:44:59,000 --> 04:45:00,120
Thank you for the super chat.

4915
04:45:00,220 --> 04:45:00,580
Thank you.

4916
04:45:00,660 --> 04:45:01,280
Thank you.

4917
04:45:01,880 --> 04:45:06,860
Zero, only the pretty man ventured the back door.

4918
04:45:08,000 --> 04:45:09,340
Thank you for the super chat.

4919
04:45:09,480 --> 04:45:09,780
Thank you.

4920
04:45:09,840 --> 04:45:10,300
Thank you.

4921
04:45:13,260 --> 04:45:14,660
Where is everybody?

4922
04:45:14,660 --> 04:45:14,720
Where is everybody?

4923
04:45:20,760 --> 04:45:22,960
Alright, they're like 1 HP now.

4924
04:45:24,460 --> 04:45:24,860
Goodbye.

4925
04:45:29,420 --> 04:45:29,820
Spin!

4926
04:45:33,400 --> 04:45:34,200
Goodbye.

4927
04:45:36,000 --> 04:45:36,300
Easy.

4928
04:45:38,460 --> 04:45:40,380
Alright, go to the bay!

4929
04:45:40,800 --> 04:45:42,160
I created a path!

4930
04:45:42,300 --> 04:45:42,880
Now go!

4931
04:45:45,120 --> 04:45:47,080
I went from the back door!

4932
04:45:50,480 --> 04:45:51,300
Here we go.

4933
04:45:51,360 --> 04:45:52,200
We did it, guys.

4934
04:45:53,920 --> 04:45:55,800
Now to chop off his head.

4935
04:45:57,840 --> 04:45:58,700
I'm ready.

4936
04:46:00,180 --> 04:46:01,360
We're all waiting for you.

4937
04:46:07,720 --> 04:46:08,240
Alright.

4938
04:46:10,260 --> 04:46:11,420
Let's go escape, guys.

4939
04:46:18,800 --> 04:46:19,580
Wait, what?

4940
04:46:19,880 --> 04:46:20,080
Wait.

4941
04:46:22,460 --> 04:46:23,420
Excuse me?

4942
04:46:23,500 --> 04:46:24,180
There's more?

4943
04:46:26,300 --> 04:46:28,160
What the fuck is he gonna do?

4944
04:46:28,880 --> 04:46:30,220
He's just a nerd.

4945
04:46:36,280 --> 04:46:38,380
Bro, he doesn't even fight.

4946
04:46:38,460 --> 04:46:39,780
He's just a fucking nerd.

4947
04:46:39,960 --> 04:46:42,020
Are we really gonna let a nerd get us?

4948
04:46:46,660 --> 04:46:47,760
Where is he?

4949
04:46:49,900 --> 04:46:51,600
Oh my god, what the fuck?

4950
04:46:51,680 --> 04:46:52,900
This nerd is fighting back.

4951
04:46:53,180 --> 04:46:55,020
What the fuck?

4952
04:46:56,280 --> 04:46:57,440
He's fighting back.

4953
04:47:00,880 --> 04:47:01,800
Alright, let's get him.

4954
04:47:02,520 --> 04:47:02,880
Get him.

4955
04:47:03,820 --> 04:47:04,900
Get over here.

4956
04:47:07,340 --> 04:47:12,720
What the fuck is his... Okay, not gonna lie, but what the fuck is his sound balance?

4957
04:47:13,400 --> 04:47:15,200
Why is it so loud?

4958
04:47:16,960 --> 04:47:21,780
Why is Chen Gong's sound balancing so loud when you hit him?

4959
04:47:23,600 --> 04:47:25,140
You guys hear that, right?

4960
04:47:27,820 --> 04:47:28,740
He's like...

4961
04:47:32,580 --> 04:47:34,440
What the fuck?

4962
04:47:39,500 --> 04:47:41,600
I can hear everything.

4963
04:47:46,120 --> 04:47:47,860
Alright, he has one more armor left.

4964
04:47:48,260 --> 04:47:48,920
Get over here.

4965
04:47:52,880 --> 04:47:53,400
Leave!

4966
04:48:01,420 --> 04:48:01,940
Guys,

4967
04:48:08,500 --> 04:48:09,840
I think we got way into it.

4968
04:48:10,480 --> 04:48:11,800
More into it than I expected.

4969
04:48:13,220 --> 04:48:15,380
So that I may be true to myself.

4970
04:48:16,740 --> 04:48:19,500
I guess it's about time.

4971
04:48:22,740 --> 04:48:25,380
And we will follow you.

4972
04:48:26,160 --> 04:48:28,080
Wherever that may lead.

4973
04:48:33,220 --> 04:48:34,220
Food reward.

4974
04:48:37,180 --> 04:48:37,980
Nice.

4975
04:48:40,840 --> 04:48:41,540
New skill.

4976
04:48:45,700 --> 04:48:47,920
Oh my god, Birch is going to be level 20 soon.

4977
04:48:48,120 --> 04:48:48,960
My little guy.

4978
04:48:50,500 --> 04:48:53,020
My big boy is going to grow up big and strong.

4979
04:48:54,600 --> 04:48:56,980
Okay, let's get this.

4980
04:48:57,920 --> 04:48:58,800
And what's this?

4981
04:48:59,380 --> 04:49:00,120
What's the money?

4982
04:49:00,820 --> 04:49:02,100
Okay, I don't need more items.

4983
04:49:02,400 --> 04:49:04,720
I'm not even using items at all.

4984
04:49:06,980 --> 04:49:07,940
I'm ungodbunga.

4985
04:49:07,980 --> 04:49:08,660
No items.

4986
04:49:09,120 --> 04:49:09,680
Found destination.

4987
04:49:13,680 --> 04:49:16,480
Lord Xiaohou Yuan, thank you for your help.

4988
04:49:19,980 --> 04:49:34,720
See, I told you he's hotter than an iPad.

4989
04:49:36,860 --> 04:49:38,720
It's just sad that we didn't get to see it.

4990
04:49:47,090 --> 04:49:48,250
Hello there.

4991
04:50:18,270 --> 04:50:19,690
Have I ever fallen so low?

4992
04:50:20,870 --> 04:50:21,690
Perhaps not.

4993
04:50:22,370 --> 04:50:27,790
But without that fall, we never would have found the courage to rise to even greater heights.

4994
04:50:28,590 --> 04:50:33,510
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, thank you for believing in me, even at my worst.

4995
04:50:34,670 --> 04:50:36,290
I have you to thank as well.

4996
04:50:37,290 --> 04:50:40,270
I could not have made it this far without all of you.

4997
04:50:42,230 --> 04:50:43,470
You've changed, brother.

4998
04:50:44,410 --> 04:50:44,890
Have I?

4999
04:50:46,470 --> 04:50:46,990
Yes.

5000
04:50:48,270 --> 04:50:50,450
You look like a man of purpose now.

5001
04:50:51,770 --> 04:50:55,290
Yeah, you were looking pretty pathetic before.

5002
04:50:57,490 --> 04:51:05,010
Guys, I can't believe you're calling Xiaohu Deng Chinese Snake when Xiaohu Deng has been part of history for like hundreds of years.

5003
04:51:08,070 --> 04:51:11,730
Xiaohu Deng was there first.

5004
04:51:12,090 --> 04:51:14,070
He's a real person.

5005
04:51:18,390 --> 04:51:21,370
He's an actual real person.

5006
04:51:21,890 --> 04:51:24,190
You're like Chinese Snake.

5007
04:51:32,750 --> 04:51:34,290
That's crazy.

5008
04:51:41,060 --> 04:51:43,730
He's been around for thousands of years.

5009
04:51:47,570 --> 04:51:49,570
An original big boss.

5010
04:51:58,720 --> 04:52:01,620
You find yourself a little bit too good with your hands to be a mere warrior?

5011
04:52:03,400 --> 04:52:05,100
And how definitely you handle gems.

5012
04:52:05,260 --> 04:52:07,480
The speed of your work is remarkable as well.

5013
04:52:07,760 --> 04:52:10,040
It's like you can see exactly what needs to be extracted.

5014
04:52:10,400 --> 04:52:11,660
That's how it appears anyway.

5015
04:52:12,200 --> 04:52:14,480
By the way, a local boy came by to thank you.

5016
04:52:15,160 --> 04:52:18,860
He said you carved him as a wooden horse out of a log with a small knife.

5017
04:52:19,020 --> 04:52:22,940
And apparently, thanks to that, he was finally able to get other children to accept him as a playmate.

5018
04:52:23,940 --> 04:52:24,660
That's all it takes?

5019
04:52:24,700 --> 04:52:25,600
A fucking horse?

5020
04:52:28,520 --> 04:52:35,140
He also mentioned that when he first saw you, he was too frightened to move, since you suddenly pulled out a knife while staring into the distance by the riverbank.

5021
04:52:35,580 --> 04:52:36,440
What were you thinking?

5022
04:52:37,020 --> 04:52:39,060
I suppose it did work out in the end though.

5023
04:52:39,120 --> 04:52:43,060
He just pulled out a fucking knife in front of a child?

5024
04:52:43,120 --> 04:52:44,560
What were you thinking?

5025
04:52:46,800 --> 04:52:48,400
I mean, he's right though.

5026
04:52:48,840 --> 04:52:51,600
The fuck, who did you pull out a knife in front of a child?

5027
04:52:59,620 --> 04:53:01,800
Alright, I'm gonna do the Lupe request.

5028
04:53:01,940 --> 04:53:02,500
There you go.

5029
04:53:04,560 --> 04:53:06,040
I increased our Lupe bond.

5030
04:53:25,640 --> 04:53:26,380
Sorry, I'm eating.

5031
04:53:30,860 --> 04:53:31,360
Hehehe.

5032
04:53:35,400 --> 04:53:36,420
Open the door!

5033
04:53:38,040 --> 04:53:40,040
What do you mean the attempt failed?

5034
04:53:40,280 --> 04:53:43,380
Like, did you- Why didn't you guys give up?

5035
04:53:43,520 --> 04:53:44,920
Just open- open the door.

5036
04:53:45,400 --> 04:53:46,500
Open the door, Dragoons.

5037
04:53:47,480 --> 04:53:49,780
There's no re- it's just like three guys.

5038
04:53:50,240 --> 04:53:51,860
Like, why are you scared?

5039
04:53:54,380 --> 04:53:55,780
We got it.

5040
04:54:00,200 --> 04:54:02,020
You're just like, owie!

5041
04:54:05,800 --> 04:54:08,780
It's three guys, Dragoons.

5042
04:54:09,360 --> 04:54:12,740
There's 15- I have 15 of you!

5043
04:54:13,020 --> 04:54:15,380
And you're scared of three guys?

5044
04:54:19,420 --> 04:54:20,200
Alright,

5045
04:54:26,580 --> 04:54:27,400
let's get rid of him.

5046
04:54:30,980 --> 04:54:31,660
Magic!

5047
04:54:32,380 --> 04:54:32,920
There you go.

5048
04:54:34,440 --> 04:54:35,620
There you go, we did it.

5049
04:54:35,680 --> 04:54:36,380
We used magic.

5050
04:54:38,640 --> 04:54:40,000
They're scary!

5051
04:54:40,440 --> 04:54:42,140
They touched me!

5052
04:54:45,060 --> 04:54:49,120
Look, I didn't- they're like, I didn't sign up to get hit.

5053
04:54:49,640 --> 04:54:52,320
I signed up to- to block doors!

5054
04:54:57,240 --> 04:54:57,920
Alright.

5055
04:55:00,200 --> 04:55:00,980
Okay.

5056
04:55:01,280 --> 04:55:02,000
Come on.

5057
04:55:03,100 --> 04:55:03,820
Come on!

5058
04:55:05,080 --> 04:55:06,600
You're so low!

5059
04:55:07,320 --> 04:55:08,900
Let me kill you!

5060
04:55:13,040 --> 04:55:14,520
Oh my god.

5061
04:55:15,120 --> 04:55:17,000
How tanky are you?

5062
04:55:17,120 --> 04:55:19,720
Just let me kill you!

5063
04:55:21,560 --> 04:55:22,640
Alright, I did it.

5064
04:55:23,200 --> 04:55:24,060
It worked.

5065
04:55:25,320 --> 04:55:27,460
Alright, the peasant should be okay now.

5066
04:55:28,300 --> 04:55:29,100
Now run!

5067
04:55:30,200 --> 04:55:30,720
Leave!

5068
04:55:31,320 --> 04:55:32,220
Get up!

5069
04:55:34,800 --> 04:55:36,280
Get up!

5070
04:55:38,040 --> 04:55:40,640
I will push you- I'm pushing him over.

5071
04:55:41,300 --> 04:55:42,200
Get up!

5072
04:55:44,220 --> 04:55:46,000
Oh my god.

5073
04:55:46,380 --> 04:55:47,920
Just get up!

5074
04:55:49,080 --> 04:55:49,700
There we go.

5075
04:55:50,040 --> 04:55:50,740
Now leave.

5076
04:55:52,140 --> 04:55:53,600
He's surrounded.

5077
04:55:56,060 --> 04:55:56,780
Alright, nice.

5078
04:55:56,940 --> 04:55:57,440
I'm a hero.

5079
04:55:57,440 --> 04:55:58,280
I'm a hero.

5080
04:56:01,090 --> 04:56:02,350
I'm a hero, guys.

5081
04:56:06,110 --> 04:56:06,550
Yay!

5082
04:56:09,370 --> 04:56:09,810
Puppies!

5083
04:56:15,650 --> 04:56:17,010
Alright, Lube, I did your stuff.

5084
04:56:18,910 --> 04:56:20,250
Yay, old coins!

5085
04:56:23,330 --> 04:56:26,650
After I'm lucky enough to have you help me along the way, I'm truly blessed.

5086
04:56:26,870 --> 04:56:31,030
It's people like you that enable me to walk this path I've chosen, and that's the truth to it.

5087
04:56:31,110 --> 04:56:32,190
Again, I thank you.

5088
04:56:32,290 --> 04:56:32,830
Alright, goodbye.

5089
04:56:35,290 --> 04:56:36,250
Level 38.

5090
04:56:36,550 --> 04:56:38,290
Okay, we're not gonna do this for now.

5091
04:56:40,070 --> 04:56:40,550
Alright.

5092
04:56:42,390 --> 04:56:43,290
Let's see.

5093
04:56:43,770 --> 04:56:45,670
I'm gonna make sure I have everything I need.

5094
04:56:48,050 --> 04:56:49,690
I don't know how to do this.

5095
04:56:49,950 --> 04:56:54,850
I don't know how- I don't know how to do this correctly.

5096
04:56:54,990 --> 04:56:56,390
I'm, like, struggling so hard.

5097
04:56:57,970 --> 04:56:59,350
Alright, let's kill Lu Bu!

5098
04:57:00,130 --> 04:57:01,970
Again, for the third time.

5099
04:57:02,510 --> 04:57:05,430
But this is the last time we finally kill Lu Bu.

5100
04:57:08,130 --> 04:57:11,930
Alright, what do I have to do?

5101
04:57:12,990 --> 04:57:15,450
Lu Bu is currently in this castle.

5102
04:57:15,750 --> 04:57:16,010
Okay.

5103
04:57:17,110 --> 04:57:19,970
We now- Oh wait, is this where we flood the castle?

5104
04:57:20,550 --> 04:57:20,870
Right?

5105
04:57:21,150 --> 04:57:25,830
Is that the- Is that the infamous mission where you flood the castle?

5106
04:57:30,510 --> 04:57:31,490
I don't remember.

5107
04:57:31,610 --> 04:57:33,250
There's so many famous ones.

5108
04:57:33,250 --> 04:57:34,590
Yeah, the flood attack, right?

5109
04:57:40,010 --> 04:57:40,410
Yeah!

5110
04:57:56,030 --> 04:57:57,190
It's where we flood the castle!

5111
04:57:57,830 --> 04:57:58,350
Okay.

5112
04:58:00,550 --> 04:58:04,490
Okay, so I just have to destroy that.

5113
04:58:15,750 --> 04:58:16,270
Yeah!

5114
04:58:17,710 --> 04:58:17,950
Okay.

5115
04:58:19,890 --> 04:58:20,570
Where's east?

5116
04:58:20,630 --> 04:58:21,170
Okay, here.

5117
04:58:22,730 --> 04:58:23,830
We're happy to help you.

5118
04:58:24,450 --> 04:58:26,930
Alright, let's go flood the castle, guys!

5119
04:58:27,270 --> 04:58:27,970
They can't swim.

5120
04:58:28,150 --> 04:58:31,470
Lu Bu has never- Lu Bu has never swam before.

5121
04:58:32,610 --> 04:58:34,670
Oh wait, did my mic volume change?

5122
04:58:35,190 --> 04:58:36,310
Oh shit, sorry.

5123
04:58:36,850 --> 04:58:37,450
I'm so sorry.

5124
04:58:38,530 --> 04:58:39,410
Guys, I'm so sorry.

5125
04:58:39,470 --> 04:58:40,170
I went too loud.

5126
04:58:40,350 --> 04:58:41,010
I'm so sorry.

5127
04:58:41,490 --> 04:58:42,370
I'm so sorry.

5128
04:58:45,650 --> 04:58:48,050
I'm so sorry to everybody's ears.

5129
04:58:48,170 --> 04:58:48,970
That's my bad.

5130
04:58:50,150 --> 04:58:51,610
That's my bad.

5131
04:58:52,270 --> 04:58:52,830
Whoops.

5132
04:58:54,650 --> 04:59:00,930
We cannot- Yeah, I accidentally went too loud.

5133
04:59:02,870 --> 04:59:05,670
You must fall here at Xiaoping no matter what it takes.

5134
04:59:06,010 --> 04:59:07,170
Alright, get out of here!

5135
04:59:07,270 --> 04:59:09,550
You're never gonna be with me, Zhang Fei!

5136
04:59:10,150 --> 04:59:12,190
You literally lost the castle!

5137
04:59:16,910 --> 04:59:17,530
Alright.

5138
04:59:20,090 --> 04:59:20,690
Alright.

5139
04:59:20,810 --> 04:59:23,670
Lu Bu, just give- Zhang Fei, just give up.

5140
04:59:31,530 --> 04:59:32,590
I'm ready.

5141
04:59:39,210 --> 04:59:39,810
Goodbye.

5142
04:59:39,810 --> 04:59:39,950
Goodbye.

5143
04:59:44,450 --> 04:59:44,970
Alright.

5144
04:59:46,190 --> 04:59:47,370
Don't worry, I'm almost there.

5145
04:59:52,410 --> 04:59:53,410
I mean, yeah.

5146
04:59:53,850 --> 04:59:54,590
What do you mean?

5147
04:59:56,270 --> 05:00:00,430
He's like, how dare you fucking try to make- What the fuck?!

5148
05:00:00,430 --> 05:00:01,450
He summoned his own!

5149
05:00:01,770 --> 05:00:03,810
He can do tornadoes too?!

5150
05:00:05,230 --> 05:00:07,310
I'm saying- I mean like, yeah, of course.

5151
05:00:07,310 --> 05:00:10,610
Why the fuck would you be at a disadvantage in war?

5152
05:00:15,450 --> 05:00:17,470
Yeah, he's definitely not a number guy.

5153
05:00:17,730 --> 05:00:21,530
He's worse than- He's worse than Lu Fei when it comes to strategy.

5154
05:00:26,190 --> 05:00:26,670
Woo!

5155
05:00:29,310 --> 05:00:30,110
Oh my god.

5156
05:00:30,230 --> 05:00:34,450
The worst thing about the tornado is just the fact that sometimes they're just everywhere.

5157
05:00:35,530 --> 05:00:36,930
I'm like, where do I go?

5158
05:00:37,750 --> 05:00:38,270
Oof.

5159
05:00:41,530 --> 05:00:42,670
Alright, we're almost there.

5160
05:00:48,410 --> 05:00:48,930
Or...

5161
05:00:49,710 --> 05:00:50,810
No, stop thinking!

5162
05:00:51,270 --> 05:00:51,750
Stop thinking!

5163
05:00:51,870 --> 05:00:52,070
No!

5164
05:00:52,130 --> 05:00:52,610
Stop thinking!

5165
05:00:55,010 --> 05:00:56,490
I don't know what you're talking about!

5166
05:00:57,010 --> 05:00:59,230
We're not going to any flood area?

5167
05:00:59,610 --> 05:01:00,250
What do you mean?

5168
05:01:07,310 --> 05:01:08,110
Who said that?

5169
05:01:10,910 --> 05:01:11,510
Alright.

5170
05:01:12,730 --> 05:01:14,850
Yeah, only cowards and nerds strategize.

5171
05:01:15,190 --> 05:01:15,690
Exactly.

5172
05:01:18,370 --> 05:01:20,750
They use their brains because they have no strength.

5173
05:01:24,610 --> 05:01:25,670
Alright, nice.

5174
05:01:27,310 --> 05:01:31,270
All I'm saying- Oh shit, Lu Bu's coming over.

5175
05:01:31,450 --> 05:01:32,110
Oh shit!

5176
05:01:32,790 --> 05:01:35,090
Oh shit, he's coming over!

5177
05:01:38,410 --> 05:01:41,110
Oh, we're preparing our flood attacks?

5178
05:01:42,510 --> 05:01:43,430
Wait, who's that?

5179
05:01:45,550 --> 05:01:46,470
Who said that?

5180
05:01:47,570 --> 05:01:48,710
Wait, where is he?

5181
05:01:50,410 --> 05:01:51,370
Li Dian.

5182
05:01:52,070 --> 05:01:52,470
Oh, okay.

5183
05:01:52,590 --> 05:01:53,790
Yeah, no, he's dead.

5184
05:01:55,090 --> 05:01:58,110
I was like, no, he's dead.

5185
05:01:58,190 --> 05:01:59,190
I'm not coming back.

5186
05:01:59,730 --> 05:02:00,710
I have good luck.

5187
05:02:04,610 --> 05:02:05,870
You're way too far.

5188
05:02:06,010 --> 05:02:07,230
There's no way to save you.

5189
05:02:07,830 --> 05:02:10,950
So this is what a true warrior looks like.

5190
05:02:11,310 --> 05:02:15,070
I must find a way to overcome this situation.

5191
05:02:15,150 --> 05:02:15,570
Good luck.

5192
05:02:15,910 --> 05:02:17,370
Sorry, you're on the other side.

5193
05:02:17,770 --> 05:02:19,530
You were not meant to win that war.

5194
05:02:20,310 --> 05:02:20,870
What?

5195
05:02:21,330 --> 05:02:23,290
Lord Lu Bu has left the castle?

5196
05:02:23,970 --> 05:02:27,010
I suppose it was foolish to think we could control him.

5197
05:02:28,270 --> 05:02:30,990
Why would you ever use Lu Bu as a puppet?

5198
05:02:31,310 --> 05:02:32,790
Like, that's just dumb.

5199
05:02:36,850 --> 05:02:37,290
Why?

5200
05:02:37,870 --> 05:02:40,510
Lu Bu is like the last person you want to use as a puppet.

5201
05:02:40,690 --> 05:02:41,790
He does not give a fuck.

5202
05:02:44,930 --> 05:02:46,970
Jesus Christ, where is that fucking title?

5203
05:02:49,430 --> 05:02:49,870
Alright.

5204
05:02:51,110 --> 05:02:52,410
We're almost done with this one too.

5205
05:02:55,150 --> 05:02:56,270
We're almost there!

5206
05:02:58,870 --> 05:03:00,070
He can't swim!

5207
05:03:00,070 --> 05:03:00,670
Swim!

5208
05:03:02,190 --> 05:03:03,050
Don't worry!

5209
05:03:03,170 --> 05:03:04,870
Lu Bu didn't learn how to swim!

5210
05:03:05,750 --> 05:03:06,710
We can do this!

5211
05:03:08,030 --> 05:03:09,310
How many betrayals?

5212
05:03:09,490 --> 05:03:09,710
Three?

5213
05:03:10,050 --> 05:03:10,490
Four?

5214
05:03:10,990 --> 05:03:11,910
I lost count.

5215
05:03:15,750 --> 05:03:19,730
I'm heading over.

5216
05:03:20,670 --> 05:03:23,670
I like how the shield guy is just watching this guy being flipped around.

5217
05:03:24,310 --> 05:03:25,270
He's like, do you think he's okay?

5218
05:03:25,830 --> 05:03:27,670
Do you think he needs us to move any closer?

5219
05:03:31,110 --> 05:03:31,710
Nice.

5220
05:03:31,850 --> 05:03:32,150
Goodbye.

5221
05:03:33,330 --> 05:03:34,770
Oh, he's not dead yet.

5222
05:03:34,850 --> 05:03:35,670
Goodbye for real.

5223
05:03:38,510 --> 05:03:39,670
Oh, okay.

5224
05:03:39,910 --> 05:03:40,430
I did it.

5225
05:03:41,250 --> 05:03:43,350
They all just fucking collapsed.

5226
05:03:44,130 --> 05:03:45,070
I take those.

5227
05:03:46,770 --> 05:03:47,870
Alright, last guy.

5228
05:03:48,690 --> 05:03:49,350
Get over here.

5229
05:03:51,090 --> 05:03:52,850
But it's always- But it's worked?

5230
05:03:53,130 --> 05:03:54,250
Oh, every time!

5231
05:03:55,610 --> 05:03:57,790
Why do I stop when it keeps working?

5232
05:04:00,210 --> 05:04:00,990
Alright, nice.

5233
05:04:01,690 --> 05:04:02,030
Goodbye.

5234
05:04:04,070 --> 05:04:04,510
Alright.

5235
05:04:06,210 --> 05:04:08,370
Alright, finish all the dams.

5236
05:04:08,810 --> 05:04:09,630
Is that everything?

5237
05:04:10,250 --> 05:04:11,410
Yeah, I did it.

5238
05:04:11,610 --> 05:04:12,370
That should be everything.

5239
05:04:12,890 --> 05:04:13,650
Alright, where is he?

5240
05:04:13,770 --> 05:04:14,590
Okay, he's over there.

5241
05:04:14,890 --> 05:04:15,490
Okay, we're fine.

5242
05:04:18,550 --> 05:04:19,730
Is that all the dams?

5243
05:04:22,070 --> 05:04:22,970
He's not okay.

5244
05:04:23,230 --> 05:04:23,550
It's fine.

5245
05:04:23,570 --> 05:04:24,030
We don't care.

5246
05:04:25,590 --> 05:04:28,050
He might not be okay, but it's okay.

5247
05:04:28,110 --> 05:04:28,710
We don't care.

5248
05:04:30,810 --> 05:04:31,530
Wait, what?

5249
05:04:35,030 --> 05:04:37,070
Alright, that's the last floodgate.

5250
05:04:37,390 --> 05:04:38,790
Is that another floodgate?

5251
05:04:38,870 --> 05:04:39,590
I can't tell.

5252
05:04:40,090 --> 05:04:41,410
Is this also a floodgate?

5253
05:04:42,150 --> 05:04:43,110
There's so many.

5254
05:04:43,190 --> 05:04:44,590
Wow, what am I gonna do?

5255
05:04:48,150 --> 05:04:48,830
Wait, what?

5256
05:04:54,610 --> 05:04:57,150
I kinda fucking hate it.

5257
05:04:58,010 --> 05:04:58,530
Okay.

5258
05:04:59,330 --> 05:04:59,930
You know what?

5259
05:04:59,990 --> 05:05:00,870
I like the effort.

5260
05:05:01,090 --> 05:05:02,210
10 out of 10 formation.

5261
05:05:04,430 --> 05:05:05,770
10 out of 10.

5262
05:05:07,190 --> 05:05:09,530
How did he break through our walls?

5263
05:05:10,650 --> 05:05:11,950
How did he do that?

5264
05:05:15,970 --> 05:05:16,990
Alright, we did it.

5265
05:05:19,890 --> 05:05:22,110
Alright, how do I start it?

5266
05:05:25,310 --> 05:05:26,250
Where's the tower?

5267
05:05:29,290 --> 05:05:29,710
Wait.

5268
05:05:31,150 --> 05:05:32,390
Oh, that's the tower.

5269
05:05:32,530 --> 05:05:34,410
Okay, I did not know where the tower was.

5270
05:05:38,090 --> 05:05:38,950
Alright, don't worry.

5271
05:05:38,990 --> 05:05:39,530
We got the tower.

5272
05:05:45,890 --> 05:05:46,310
Alright.

5273
05:05:48,150 --> 05:05:48,690
Don't worry.

5274
05:05:53,050 --> 05:05:53,590
You know what?

5275
05:05:53,650 --> 05:05:54,070
Fuck it.

5276
05:05:54,410 --> 05:05:55,390
I can rebuild this.

5277
05:05:56,100 --> 05:05:58,670
The greatest strategy ever.

5278
05:05:59,130 --> 05:06:00,870
Just walk around.

5279
05:06:01,290 --> 05:06:02,210
Yeah, I was gonna say.

5280
05:06:02,430 --> 05:06:05,070
I was like, alright, so like...

5281
05:06:06,830 --> 05:06:07,530
Like...

5282
05:06:07,530 --> 05:06:09,390
What kind of fucking...

5283
05:06:11,030 --> 05:06:13,830
What was that fucking shield?

5284
05:06:15,750 --> 05:06:17,390
I was so confused.

5285
05:06:20,050 --> 05:06:22,570
Like, what did he want me to do there?

5286
05:06:22,870 --> 05:06:24,270
Not walk around?

5287
05:06:29,790 --> 05:06:30,250
Okay.

5288
05:06:30,390 --> 05:06:31,070
Okay, where's the guy?

5289
05:06:31,910 --> 05:06:33,410
I've like lost track of him.

5290
05:06:33,750 --> 05:06:34,530
Where is he?

5291
05:06:34,610 --> 05:06:34,950
Oh, okay.

5292
05:06:35,050 --> 05:06:36,210
I shot behind me.

5293
05:06:37,110 --> 05:06:37,870
That's awkward.

5294
05:06:39,110 --> 05:06:39,670
It's okay.

5295
05:06:39,890 --> 05:06:41,370
There should be enough for Guanyin though.

5296
05:06:45,670 --> 05:06:46,370
It's okay.

5297
05:06:49,550 --> 05:06:50,410
He's one hit.

5298
05:06:51,650 --> 05:06:52,110
Nice!

5299
05:06:55,390 --> 05:06:56,790
It's the water time!

5300
05:06:57,390 --> 05:06:58,110
Open the dam!

5301
05:06:59,170 --> 05:07:01,070
Nobody's gonna hit you!

5302
05:07:03,030 --> 05:07:03,530
Nice.

5303
05:07:05,990 --> 05:07:06,730
Come on!

5304
05:07:11,150 --> 05:07:12,190
We're almost there.

5305
05:07:16,330 --> 05:07:16,830
Activate!

5306
05:07:16,830 --> 05:07:16,870
Okay.

5307
05:07:24,500 --> 05:07:26,920
We did it, guys.

5308
05:07:27,280 --> 05:07:29,200
Now they can't swim.

5309
05:07:30,700 --> 05:07:33,380
They never learn how to swim.

5310
05:07:40,180 --> 05:07:41,030
That's right.

5311
05:07:45,350 --> 05:07:47,590
His one weakness...

5312
05:07:47,590 --> 05:07:48,030
Water!

5313
05:07:52,530 --> 05:07:53,150
What?

5314
05:07:53,310 --> 05:07:55,330
What are you gonna do now?!

5315
05:08:05,310 --> 05:08:06,270
That's right!

5316
05:08:06,410 --> 05:08:07,650
His greatest weakness!

5317
05:08:09,050 --> 05:08:09,530
Liquid!

5318
05:08:11,610 --> 05:08:13,270
Alright, we gotta kill this guy though.

5319
05:08:13,270 --> 05:08:16,150
I wasn't expecting defectors.

5320
05:08:16,730 --> 05:08:19,210
We need to rethink our next move.

5321
05:08:20,170 --> 05:08:21,430
There must be a way.

5322
05:08:21,530 --> 05:08:22,590
Dracos, get ready!

5323
05:08:23,130 --> 05:08:24,090
Too bad, too worse.

5324
05:08:25,030 --> 05:08:26,310
No, this ends it.

5325
05:08:26,370 --> 05:08:26,650
Time to act.

5326
05:08:26,650 --> 05:08:29,670
My blade and my will have not been broken yet!

5327
05:08:31,730 --> 05:08:32,890
Woah, now!

5328
05:08:34,230 --> 05:08:36,190
I must get back to the castle.

5329
05:08:36,190 --> 05:08:39,610
Alright, you should say that before I started like, you know...

5330
05:08:40,130 --> 05:08:41,050
Making you...

5331
05:08:41,050 --> 05:08:41,550
Oh, shit!

5332
05:08:41,850 --> 05:08:42,330
Oh, shit!

5333
05:08:44,650 --> 05:08:45,590
Oh, shit!

5334
05:08:46,730 --> 05:08:47,330
Nice.

5335
05:08:49,650 --> 05:08:50,790
Oh, wait, he wants to duel?

5336
05:08:51,110 --> 05:08:52,250
Let's fucking go!

5337
05:08:53,410 --> 05:08:55,510
I get to waste less time!

5338
05:08:55,830 --> 05:08:56,630
Let's go!

5339
05:08:59,270 --> 05:09:00,470
Okay, um...

5340
05:09:00,470 --> 05:09:02,770
Um, okay...

5341
05:09:02,770 --> 05:09:04,270
Oh, ho, ho, ho, okay!

5342
05:09:05,810 --> 05:09:06,410
Um...

5343
05:09:06,410 --> 05:09:06,990
Is that...

5344
05:09:06,990 --> 05:09:08,050
Okay, he...

5345
05:09:08,050 --> 05:09:09,150
Okay, he is...

5346
05:09:09,150 --> 05:09:10,910
He is a lot stronger, guys.

5347
05:09:12,050 --> 05:09:12,650
Um...

5348
05:09:14,030 --> 05:09:15,050
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

5349
05:09:15,170 --> 05:09:17,030
I made it back, I made it back, I made it back, guys.

5350
05:09:17,150 --> 05:09:17,430
It's fine.

5351
05:09:18,430 --> 05:09:18,970
It's fine.

5352
05:09:19,670 --> 05:09:21,230
There you go, I got it back, I got it back.

5353
05:09:24,050 --> 05:09:25,490
I got that word, not gonna lie.

5354
05:09:25,710 --> 05:09:26,310
But it's okay.

5355
05:09:27,550 --> 05:09:28,050
Oh, shit.

5356
05:09:28,130 --> 05:09:29,450
I got that word, but it's okay.

5357
05:09:32,150 --> 05:09:32,750
Jesus Christ.

5358
05:09:32,870 --> 05:09:34,350
Okay, this guy actually knows how to duel.

5359
05:09:35,510 --> 05:09:36,650
He has hands!

5360
05:09:38,670 --> 05:09:39,370
But I did it.

5361
05:09:39,370 --> 05:09:41,850
I did it.

5362
05:09:42,990 --> 05:09:44,150
Alright, nice.

5363
05:09:57,880 --> 05:09:58,680
Um...

5364
05:09:58,680 --> 05:10:00,540
I don't know!

5365
05:10:02,560 --> 05:10:03,700
Wait, he has peers?

5366
05:10:03,920 --> 05:10:04,700
Wait, he came back?

5367
05:10:08,020 --> 05:10:09,700
I'm coming in!

5368
05:10:10,840 --> 05:10:11,080
Hope he didn't have a move...

5369
05:10:11,080 --> 05:10:12,600
i'm just gonna knock the enemy and corner him.

5370
05:10:15,940 --> 05:10:16,520
Alright.

5371
05:10:17,300 --> 05:10:18,980
The FIET CHANG-HAWN, alright cool.

5372
05:10:19,120 --> 05:10:19,660
I can do that.

5373
05:10:21,740 --> 05:10:24,080
Jesus Chris, what the fuck?!

5374
05:10:24,080 --> 05:10:24,600
OMG!

5375
05:10:25,160 --> 05:10:26,240
Bro, I can just do that.

5376
05:10:27,620 --> 05:10:28,180
WOOOO!

5377
05:10:30,260 --> 05:10:31,520
I'm MOWING the line!

5378
05:10:33,440 --> 05:10:35,680
I'm gonna MOW that line!

5379
05:10:38,880 --> 05:10:39,460
Okay.

5380
05:10:40,400 --> 05:10:40,960
Goodbye.

5381
05:10:43,900 --> 05:10:44,260
Tenacity?

5382
05:10:44,420 --> 05:10:45,620
I just killed a guy.

5383
05:10:46,160 --> 05:10:48,040
How do you still have tenacity?

5384
05:10:48,880 --> 05:10:49,820
What the fuck?

5385
05:10:50,240 --> 05:10:52,300
Don't worry, I can keep mowing this lawn.

5386
05:10:56,080 --> 05:10:58,200
Let me just keep mowing.

5387
05:10:59,620 --> 05:11:02,900
Wow, I already killed 200 within that time frame.

5388
05:11:03,480 --> 05:11:04,700
Don't worry, I can do it again!

5389
05:11:08,760 --> 05:11:11,240
I need more people to mow.

5390
05:11:13,140 --> 05:11:15,960
Okay, where am I?

5391
05:11:16,280 --> 05:11:17,460
I lost track of where I am.

5392
05:11:20,160 --> 05:11:24,880
Jesus Christ, I still need to kill 700 more?!

5393
05:11:24,880 --> 05:11:25,920
Alright, fuck this.

5394
05:11:28,560 --> 05:11:30,520
Okay, a thousand.

5395
05:11:32,080 --> 05:11:33,120
Army of one!

5396
05:11:37,860 --> 05:11:39,160
Alright, 200 more!

5397
05:11:39,260 --> 05:11:40,780
Who wants to have winnows tonight?

5398
05:11:44,300 --> 05:11:45,500
Alright, I can.

5399
05:11:45,580 --> 05:11:46,400
You guys know that.

5400
05:11:46,780 --> 05:11:48,660
Maybe it'd be easier if I sent out the tornado.

5401
05:11:49,320 --> 05:11:55,240
Maybe it would be.

5402
05:11:55,340 --> 05:11:55,860
Yeah, it was.

5403
05:11:56,260 --> 05:11:58,560
It was actually easier by sending out a tornado.

5404
05:11:58,560 --> 05:12:02,180
Oh my god, please.

5405
05:12:02,640 --> 05:12:03,700
The guard has fled!

5406
05:12:03,900 --> 05:12:04,480
Who left?

5407
05:12:04,920 --> 05:12:05,400
Who left?

5408
05:12:06,180 --> 05:12:07,590
All of you guys left?!

5409
05:12:10,560 --> 05:12:12,960
Okay, all my dragoons left, guys.

5410
05:12:16,120 --> 05:12:20,370
I'm literally mowing the lawn for you guys and you still leave?!

5411
05:12:24,100 --> 05:12:25,540
It's fine, I did it.

5412
05:12:25,660 --> 05:12:26,580
I didn't need you guys.

5413
05:12:31,080 --> 05:12:34,140
I literally mowed the lawn and you all left.

5414
05:12:34,400 --> 05:12:35,760
I can't believe it.

5415
05:12:36,300 --> 05:12:38,380
Chat, I can't believe it.

5416
05:12:38,520 --> 05:12:40,000
What are you afraid of?!

5417
05:12:45,060 --> 05:12:47,380
Every dragoon for themselves.

5418
05:12:47,880 --> 05:12:50,240
What are you afraid of?!

5419
05:12:50,240 --> 05:12:52,060
I killed them all!

5420
05:12:55,380 --> 05:12:57,360
They're all dead!

5421
05:12:57,660 --> 05:12:59,240
What more are you running from?!

5422
05:13:04,000 --> 05:13:06,200
Wait, I literally killed them all.

5423
05:13:07,020 --> 05:13:09,080
We can't touch grass.

5424
05:13:11,060 --> 05:13:12,680
Like, is there more?

5425
05:13:15,380 --> 05:13:16,900
Wait, they're all dead.

5426
05:13:17,580 --> 05:13:17,980
Yeah!

5427
05:13:21,520 --> 05:13:22,320
Wait, where?!

5428
05:13:22,320 --> 05:13:29,720
There's like, remaining forces somewhere, but where?!

5429
05:13:30,280 --> 05:13:31,560
Alright, we just go in.

5430
05:13:33,080 --> 05:13:34,320
We just go straight in.

5431
05:13:36,060 --> 05:13:36,960
Oh, there they are.

5432
05:13:37,060 --> 05:13:37,660
There he is.

5433
05:13:37,720 --> 05:13:41,300
I was like, where the fuck is the last remaining guards or forces?

5434
05:13:44,860 --> 05:13:45,580
Okay, nice.

5435
05:13:45,640 --> 05:13:46,140
Get out of here.

5436
05:13:51,260 --> 05:13:52,660
Hello?

5437
05:13:53,200 --> 05:13:53,860
Hello?

5438
05:13:55,860 --> 05:13:56,440
Tau Tau?

5439
05:13:56,940 --> 05:13:57,240
Hello?

5440
05:13:58,100 --> 05:13:59,680
Army of One here?

5441
05:14:00,540 --> 05:14:01,320
What?

5442
05:14:04,640 --> 05:14:06,180
Army of One?!

5443
05:14:09,160 --> 05:14:10,220
That's fine.

5444
05:14:11,420 --> 05:14:13,380
That's fine.

5445
05:14:16,380 --> 05:14:17,340
That's okay.

5446
05:14:18,200 --> 05:14:20,200
Like, I guess I don't matter.

5447
05:14:23,280 --> 05:14:24,400
Where is he?

5448
05:14:25,060 --> 05:14:27,580
Alright, get over here.

5449
05:14:31,660 --> 05:14:34,960
Alright, yoink my credit now.

5450
05:14:40,280 --> 05:14:41,500
Alright, here we go.

5451
05:14:42,000 --> 05:14:44,280
I summoned Guan Yu just to kill him.

5452
05:14:45,580 --> 05:14:46,980
Get over here.

5453
05:14:48,440 --> 05:14:49,840
What did I do?

5454
05:14:55,520 --> 05:14:57,080
That's fucking right.

5455
05:14:57,560 --> 05:14:59,040
It's Musou time.

5456
05:14:59,820 --> 05:15:00,920
That's right.

5457
05:15:02,480 --> 05:15:06,620
Oh, I have- I can do expand energy dome?!

5458
05:15:06,620 --> 05:15:07,600
What the fuck?

5459
05:15:07,680 --> 05:15:09,560
I went JJK over there.

5460
05:15:10,620 --> 05:15:13,060
Get in my domain expansion.

5461
05:15:16,020 --> 05:15:17,380
Take this!

5462
05:15:19,320 --> 05:15:21,580
I literally do a main expansion in there.

5463
05:15:24,800 --> 05:15:25,480
Goodbye.

5464
05:15:26,840 --> 05:15:28,000
It looked so cool.

5465
05:15:28,220 --> 05:15:29,700
Another victory in the name of my brother.

5466
05:15:30,160 --> 05:15:33,980
After exhausting all my cunning, here I am.

5467
05:15:36,860 --> 05:15:37,600
Yippee!

5468
05:15:37,600 --> 05:15:38,340
Yippee!

5469
05:15:41,960 --> 05:15:45,280
Guys, I think Chen Gong is very mad at Lu Bu, guys.

5470
05:15:49,340 --> 05:15:50,080
Whoa.

5471
05:15:53,820 --> 05:15:54,320
Whoa.

5472
05:15:55,080 --> 05:15:55,080
Whoa.

5473
05:16:08,720 --> 05:16:09,240
Whoa.

5474
05:16:15,520 --> 05:16:16,040
Whoa.

5475
05:16:16,040 --> 05:16:16,560
Whoa.

5476
05:16:18,800 --> 05:16:19,320
Nice.

5477
05:16:22,000 --> 05:16:22,520
Yippee!

5478
05:16:27,340 --> 05:16:30,740
Alright, time to fight Lu Bu for the fifth time.

5479
05:16:32,600 --> 05:16:33,780
I'm so ready.

5480
05:16:33,880 --> 05:16:34,820
Oh, here we go.

5481
05:16:34,920 --> 05:16:35,320
Alright, guys.

5482
05:16:35,400 --> 05:16:36,380
Oh, you're all gonna watch?

5483
05:16:37,480 --> 05:16:39,960
You're not gonna help out?

5484
05:16:40,580 --> 05:16:40,840
Yeah?

5485
05:16:42,460 --> 05:16:43,460
Hey, guys.

5486
05:16:43,660 --> 05:16:45,080
You wanna come in here with me?

5487
05:16:47,660 --> 05:16:48,240
Oh.

5488
05:16:53,640 --> 05:16:54,740
Oh, shit.

5489
05:16:54,960 --> 05:16:57,960
Oh, my- Oh, my god.

5490
05:17:01,980 --> 05:17:02,960
I forgot.

5491
05:17:03,240 --> 05:17:04,520
I- I forgot.

5492
05:17:04,760 --> 05:17:05,040
Okay.

5493
05:17:05,040 --> 05:17:07,360
I forgot how much I hated this.

5494
05:17:08,080 --> 05:17:13,000
It doesn't even get off his fucking horse.

5495
05:17:14,200 --> 05:17:17,100
Oh, my- Get off your horse!

5496
05:17:19,240 --> 05:17:20,900
Oh, my god.

5497
05:17:21,640 --> 05:17:24,360
This guy- Please.

5498
05:17:26,000 --> 05:17:27,240
Not fair!

5499
05:17:29,400 --> 05:17:31,580
He just- He can just do that?

5500
05:17:31,580 --> 05:17:33,780
He can just

5501
05:17:41,100 --> 05:17:45,600
- Like, he just runs away on his horse!

5502
05:17:49,080 --> 05:17:49,960
I'm trying!

5503
05:17:52,280 --> 05:17:53,360
Oh, my god!

5504
05:17:55,180 --> 05:17:55,840
Oh, my god.

5505
05:17:55,840 --> 05:17:56,660
He got off his horse, guys.

5506
05:17:57,340 --> 05:17:58,400
Guys, he did it.

5507
05:18:02,080 --> 05:18:02,640
Oh, my god.

5508
05:18:02,660 --> 05:18:03,160
He did it.

5509
05:18:03,720 --> 05:18:05,400
He got off his horse, guys.

5510
05:18:06,060 --> 05:18:06,620
Oh, my god.

5511
05:18:06,620 --> 05:18:07,380
The bare minimum.

5512
05:18:09,940 --> 05:18:11,320
Oh, my god.

5513
05:18:13,160 --> 05:18:15,240
At least it- Guys, he did his bare minimum.

5514
05:18:15,600 --> 05:18:17,300
Jesus Christ!

5515
05:18:19,860 --> 05:18:20,960
Oh, my god.

5516
05:18:23,240 --> 05:18:24,620
Oh, my god!

5517
05:18:28,100 --> 05:18:28,520
Please.

5518
05:18:28,520 --> 05:18:30,500
Please, I don't know if I have enough funds.

5519
05:18:33,460 --> 05:18:34,140
Oh, my god.

5520
05:18:34,200 --> 05:18:36,000
I'm on- Oh, my god.

5521
05:18:36,160 --> 05:18:40,300
Oh, my god, you fucking- What do you mean you fled?!

5522
05:18:45,920 --> 05:18:47,580
I have two buns left.

5523
05:18:47,860 --> 05:18:50,460
I have two buns and he's not even close!

5524
05:18:51,220 --> 05:18:54,020
Like- Yes.

5525
05:18:57,200 --> 05:18:58,140
Bro, I'm not even halfway!

5526
05:19:01,400 --> 05:19:02,020
Oh, my god.

5527
05:19:04,560 --> 05:19:05,080
Jeez!

5528
05:19:08,760 --> 05:19:09,980
Oh, my god!

5529
05:19:10,320 --> 05:19:12,140
Please tell me there's buns near me.

5530
05:19:12,380 --> 05:19:14,820
Please tell me there's buns near me, guys.

5531
05:19:15,520 --> 05:19:16,940
Oh, there is.

5532
05:19:16,960 --> 05:19:17,400
I see it.

5533
05:19:17,960 --> 05:19:19,140
I see the buns.

5534
05:19:21,040 --> 05:19:21,520
Okay.

5535
05:19:22,920 --> 05:19:24,400
I'm only not even halfway.

5536
05:19:25,020 --> 05:19:26,360
I think that's the worst part.

5537
05:19:28,760 --> 05:19:29,720
Jesus Christ!

5538
05:19:31,560 --> 05:19:31,940
Goodbye.

5539
05:19:32,580 --> 05:19:33,320
Oh, shit.

5540
05:19:33,440 --> 05:19:34,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5541
05:19:34,960 --> 05:19:36,540
I have to do this first.

5542
05:19:38,880 --> 05:19:40,020
All right, goodbye.

5543
05:19:41,860 --> 05:19:42,420
Goodbye.

5544
05:19:43,560 --> 05:19:44,120
Goodbye.

5545
05:19:44,400 --> 05:19:44,960
Goodbye.

5546
05:19:45,140 --> 05:19:46,160
Go to the buns.

5547
05:19:53,620 --> 05:19:56,420
It's just me, Guan Yun, and Zhang Fei.

5548
05:20:01,420 --> 05:20:04,560
My dragon- I- I swear to god, dragons!

5549
05:20:09,160 --> 05:20:10,580
You guys will help!

5550
05:20:10,780 --> 05:20:12,740
You guys are gonna stay throughout the fight, right?

5551
05:20:13,280 --> 05:20:13,920
Right?

5552
05:20:15,200 --> 05:20:16,340
Right, guys?

5553
05:20:18,420 --> 05:20:20,840
You'll stay throughout it, right, guys?

5554
05:20:24,300 --> 05:20:24,940
Yeah.

5555
05:20:27,540 --> 05:20:28,180
Okay.

5556
05:20:30,320 --> 05:20:31,240
Okay, we're fine.

5557
05:20:33,420 --> 05:20:34,320
It's fine.

5558
05:20:36,540 --> 05:20:37,060
Okay.

5559
05:20:39,220 --> 05:20:40,400
Oh my god, we're halfway.

5560
05:20:41,080 --> 05:20:41,760
We're halfway.

5561
05:20:42,520 --> 05:20:43,620
Guys, we've hit halfway.

5562
05:20:46,540 --> 05:20:47,980
We've hit halfway, guys.

5563
05:20:51,680 --> 05:20:53,020
I have no buns.

5564
05:20:53,880 --> 05:20:55,220
I have no more buns.

5565
05:20:55,360 --> 05:20:57,000
Is there any more buns near me?

5566
05:20:57,640 --> 05:20:58,000
Is there?

5567
05:20:59,080 --> 05:20:59,600
Yes!

5568
05:20:59,840 --> 05:21:00,760
There's one more!

5569
05:21:04,700 --> 05:21:06,940
There's one more!

5570
05:21:07,820 --> 05:21:08,200
Guys, what?!

5571
05:21:08,200 --> 05:21:10,420
Dragons, what do you mean you're falling back?!

5572
05:21:13,460 --> 05:21:15,260
Dragons, what do you mean?!

5573
05:21:19,420 --> 05:21:20,700
What do you mean, guys?

5574
05:21:21,700 --> 05:21:22,700
What do you mean?

5575
05:21:24,700 --> 05:21:26,960
What happened to helping me?

5576
05:21:34,780 --> 05:21:35,980
Dragons, come on!

5577
05:21:37,100 --> 05:21:41,200
What happened to Fordoki?!

5578
05:21:42,520 --> 05:21:43,000
Guys!

5579
05:21:43,760 --> 05:21:45,100
Come on, we're almost there!

5580
05:21:48,560 --> 05:21:50,320
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5581
05:21:52,820 --> 05:21:53,760
Oh my god.

5582
05:21:58,080 --> 05:22:03,500
Oh my god, it's just me and Guanyin, but I don't think Guanyin's gonna be here any longer, guys.

5583
05:22:04,740 --> 05:22:05,980
Oh my god.

5584
05:22:06,320 --> 05:22:09,740
Guys, I don't- I think he's gonna leave very soon.

5585
05:22:13,260 --> 05:22:19,020
Oh my god, are you only doing that little damage?

5586
05:22:19,540 --> 05:22:21,120
It's literally just me and him!

5587
05:22:22,560 --> 05:22:24,300
Wait, he fucking- oh my god!

5588
05:22:24,460 --> 05:22:25,680
He actually stunned it too!

5589
05:22:28,640 --> 05:22:29,560
Oh my god.

5590
05:22:31,360 --> 05:22:32,680
It's just me and him!

5591
05:22:32,680 --> 05:22:34,980
It's actually just me and him!

5592
05:22:37,460 --> 05:22:39,680
Oh my god, he counters my counter!

5593
05:22:47,450 --> 05:22:48,010
Okay.

5594
05:22:48,550 --> 05:22:49,930
Guys, is there any more buns?

5595
05:22:50,050 --> 05:22:51,010
Guys, there's no more buns!

5596
05:22:51,790 --> 05:22:54,310
Guys, there's no more buns, guys!

5597
05:22:55,910 --> 05:22:57,270
I'm so scared!

5598
05:22:58,170 --> 05:22:59,670
There's no more buns!

5599
05:23:05,530 --> 05:23:06,490
Oh my god.

5600
05:23:08,730 --> 05:23:09,650
Stop countering!

5601
05:23:10,630 --> 05:23:12,190
Oh my god!

5602
05:23:14,930 --> 05:23:15,610
Jesus.

5603
05:23:16,550 --> 05:23:17,050
Oh no.

5604
05:23:17,570 --> 05:23:18,910
Guys, I think it's over.

5605
05:23:19,950 --> 05:23:22,070
Guys, I think it's over, guys.

5606
05:23:24,690 --> 05:23:26,510
Guys, it might be over!

5607
05:23:27,190 --> 05:23:28,630
It might be over!

5608
05:23:29,370 --> 05:23:31,270
I have no more buns!

5609
05:23:31,650 --> 05:23:33,670
There's no more, guys!

5610
05:23:36,170 --> 05:23:38,810
There's actually no more buns!

5611
05:23:40,670 --> 05:23:41,170
No!

5612
05:23:42,130 --> 05:23:44,490
I dodged everything!

5613
05:23:45,890 --> 05:23:46,750
No!

5614
05:23:50,090 --> 05:23:52,230
It was so close!

5615
05:23:53,670 --> 05:23:54,970
It was so close!

5616
05:23:55,410 --> 05:23:56,530
What the fuck?

5617
05:23:56,790 --> 05:23:58,210
Where did he come from?

5618
05:24:00,230 --> 05:24:03,850
Where did he come from?

5619
05:24:03,850 --> 05:24:05,310
Oh my god!

5620
05:24:09,790 --> 05:24:12,210
Actually, where did I come from?

5621
05:24:15,410 --> 05:24:17,330
What do you mean, where am I looking?

5622
05:24:17,610 --> 05:24:19,850
I don't even know where...

5623
05:24:20,470 --> 05:24:22,350
I didn't see him!

5624
05:24:26,030 --> 05:24:27,650
He can't be!

5625
05:24:28,050 --> 05:24:29,810
What do you want from me?

5626
05:24:29,870 --> 05:24:31,870
He actually can't be!

5627
05:24:33,850 --> 05:24:34,110
Oh my god!

5628
05:24:34,510 --> 05:24:35,630
Holy shit!

5629
05:24:37,070 --> 05:24:38,710
What the fuck is this?

5630
05:24:39,730 --> 05:24:40,110
Okay.

5631
05:24:41,590 --> 05:24:42,290
Okay.

5632
05:24:43,030 --> 05:24:44,170
Oh my god.

5633
05:24:46,550 --> 05:24:47,250
Okay.

5634
05:24:48,970 --> 05:24:50,870
No, we have one bun.

5635
05:24:51,030 --> 05:24:52,170
No bun in a dream.

5636
05:24:53,090 --> 05:24:54,730
Oh my god, okay.

5637
05:24:54,890 --> 05:24:57,030
But we literally almost did it.

5638
05:24:57,830 --> 05:24:58,770
We almost...

5639
05:24:58,770 --> 05:25:00,650
We almost one-tried him.

5640
05:25:00,650 --> 05:25:01,850
That's crazy though.

5641
05:25:01,990 --> 05:25:06,590
Okay, I'm gonna admit, I am proud of us for almost getting a one-try.

5642
05:25:06,870 --> 05:25:07,550
First try.

5643
05:25:09,870 --> 05:25:11,190
Jesus Christ.

5644
05:25:13,710 --> 05:25:14,430
Whoops.

5645
05:25:16,170 --> 05:25:16,590
Okay.

5646
05:25:17,330 --> 05:25:18,050
What?

5647
05:25:18,110 --> 05:25:19,030
He countered me!

5648
05:25:19,170 --> 05:25:21,910
Oh god.

5649
05:25:23,230 --> 05:25:23,950
Okay.

5650
05:25:23,950 --> 05:25:24,070
Okay.

5651
05:25:27,730 --> 05:25:29,450
Jesus Christ, I'm not winning this one.

5652
05:25:29,570 --> 05:25:30,610
I'm literally one HP, guys.

5653
05:25:31,410 --> 05:25:32,870
Yes, I'm one HP, guys.

5654
05:25:35,810 --> 05:25:37,090
Oh no!

5655
05:25:39,750 --> 05:25:41,830
He countered my counter!

5656
05:25:42,310 --> 05:25:44,970
I literally have no more buns left.

5657
05:25:46,710 --> 05:25:47,350
Jesus.

5658
05:25:48,710 --> 05:25:49,930
So illegal.

5659
05:25:49,930 --> 05:25:50,330
So...

5660
05:25:51,730 --> 05:25:54,230
Like, he camps me out of it too.

5661
05:25:56,390 --> 05:25:56,950
Okay.

5662
05:26:00,730 --> 05:26:01,290
Okay.

5663
05:26:01,750 --> 05:26:02,850
I'm locking in, guys.

5664
05:26:05,210 --> 05:26:06,250
I'm locking in.

5665
05:26:07,530 --> 05:26:07,810
Okay.

5666
05:26:10,650 --> 05:26:11,210
Okay.

5667
05:26:11,910 --> 05:26:12,610
I have to lock in.

5668
05:26:17,890 --> 05:26:18,790
Oh my god.

5669
05:26:18,790 --> 05:26:21,550
Lock in.

5670
05:26:22,550 --> 05:26:31,130
Oh shit!

5671
05:26:31,510 --> 05:26:32,710
Almost got it too!

5672
05:26:37,570 --> 05:26:39,270
Jesus Christ.

5673
05:26:40,870 --> 05:26:41,650
Jesus Christ.

5674
05:26:43,610 --> 05:26:45,150
Oh my god.

5675
05:26:48,070 --> 05:26:49,190
Jesus Christ.

5676
05:26:49,910 --> 05:26:51,650
No, no, no, no!

5677
05:26:51,650 --> 05:26:53,230
Oh my god, I said no!

5678
05:26:55,710 --> 05:26:56,270
Okay.

5679
05:26:56,650 --> 05:26:57,510
That was an accident.

5680
05:27:02,670 --> 05:27:03,610
Does he counter?

5681
05:27:03,670 --> 05:27:04,990
He counters my counter!

5682
05:27:05,150 --> 05:27:06,090
It's like not fair!

5683
05:27:09,110 --> 05:27:09,670
Oh.

5684
05:27:16,450 --> 05:27:18,430
Is this the only thing I can do?

5685
05:27:20,050 --> 05:27:21,310
No way!

5686
05:27:21,870 --> 05:27:23,130
No way!

5687
05:27:24,010 --> 05:27:25,770
No way!

5688
05:27:27,010 --> 05:27:27,950
What?!

5689
05:27:27,950 --> 05:27:30,420
I got hit?!

5690
05:27:31,210 --> 05:27:33,170
Oh my god.

5691
05:27:36,370 --> 05:27:38,150
I can't believe I got hit.

5692
05:27:40,650 --> 05:27:42,050
Wait, I'm focusing.

5693
05:27:46,950 --> 05:27:47,910
Okay.

5694
05:27:50,390 --> 05:27:51,350
Okay.

5695
05:27:53,330 --> 05:27:53,810
Focus.

5696
05:27:56,950 --> 05:27:58,410
Jesus Christ!

5697
05:28:00,730 --> 05:28:00,790
Alright.

5698
05:28:06,170 --> 05:28:07,450
Your turn.

5699
05:28:09,510 --> 05:28:10,470
Boom!

5700
05:28:11,570 --> 05:28:13,510
Alright, I can whale him a little bit apparently.

5701
05:28:15,870 --> 05:28:16,470
Okay.

5702
05:28:19,910 --> 05:28:20,510
Jesus.

5703
05:28:24,890 --> 05:28:26,770
Oh my god, that's bullshit!

5704
05:28:29,850 --> 05:28:31,850
Come on, come on, come on.

5705
05:28:32,910 --> 05:28:33,570
Come on!

5706
05:28:35,770 --> 05:28:37,330
He's so strong!

5707
05:28:40,350 --> 05:28:42,570
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay, that's okay!

5708
05:28:46,910 --> 05:28:47,630
Goodbye!

5709
05:28:49,970 --> 05:28:50,690
Oh!

5710
05:28:51,130 --> 05:28:51,850
Okay.

5711
05:28:54,330 --> 05:28:55,490
Jesus Christ.

5712
05:28:55,850 --> 05:28:57,330
Sometimes I'm like, where is he?

5713
05:28:58,490 --> 05:28:59,330
He has to get close.

5714
05:28:59,690 --> 05:29:02,550
He has to- Nice.

5715
05:29:08,750 --> 05:29:09,670
Come on.

5716
05:29:11,750 --> 05:29:13,070
He's so close.

5717
05:29:13,770 --> 05:29:14,230
Oh.

5718
05:29:15,470 --> 05:29:15,930
Oh!

5719
05:29:23,130 --> 05:29:23,590
No!

5720
05:29:27,550 --> 05:29:31,030
No, no, no, no, no!

5721
05:29:31,030 --> 05:29:31,770
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

5722
05:29:32,670 --> 05:29:34,130
Please, please, please, please hit him!

5723
05:29:36,150 --> 05:29:36,610
No!

5724
05:29:38,670 --> 05:29:38,970
No!

5725
05:29:44,930 --> 05:29:45,970
It

5726
05:29:49,740 --> 05:29:51,740
was so close!

5727
05:29:53,340 --> 05:29:54,780
Where is he?

5728
05:29:55,460 --> 05:29:56,960
It was so close.

5729
05:29:57,140 --> 05:29:58,140
I'm so sad.

5730
05:29:59,840 --> 05:30:00,280
Jesus.

5731
05:30:01,440 --> 05:30:03,100
Oh my god.

5732
05:30:05,820 --> 05:30:07,520
He's so strong!

5733
05:30:08,040 --> 05:30:09,520
Jesus Christ!

5734
05:30:12,400 --> 05:30:13,420
Come on!

5735
05:30:13,840 --> 05:30:14,580
Come on!

5736
05:30:18,120 --> 05:30:19,020
Oh my god.

5737
05:30:19,380 --> 05:30:20,800
I want to get away from him.

5738
05:30:21,500 --> 05:30:22,260
Okay, nice.

5739
05:30:26,040 --> 05:30:26,600
Alright.

5740
05:30:28,140 --> 05:30:29,880
I'm locked in, I'm locked in, I'm locked in.

5741
05:30:35,680 --> 05:30:36,240
Alright.

5742
05:30:37,540 --> 05:30:38,380
Get closer.

5743
05:30:40,700 --> 05:30:41,820
Jesus Christ!

5744
05:30:43,100 --> 05:30:43,620
Oh.

5745
05:30:46,840 --> 05:30:47,360
Okay.

5746
05:30:50,080 --> 05:30:51,300
Come on, come on.

5747
05:30:52,340 --> 05:30:53,620
I'm locking in right now.

5748
05:30:57,840 --> 05:30:58,360
What?!

5749
05:30:58,900 --> 05:31:00,220
Okay, that was a dodge.

5750
05:31:01,760 --> 05:31:04,180
That was 100% a dodge right there.

5751
05:31:06,000 --> 05:31:07,800
Oh my god, I wish there were more buttons.

5752
05:31:08,600 --> 05:31:09,640
Oh no!

5753
05:31:10,500 --> 05:31:12,640
Why is there no more buttons?!

5754
05:31:14,180 --> 05:31:14,700
Please!

5755
05:31:18,060 --> 05:31:20,020
Okay, maybe I'm not locked in, guys.

5756
05:31:20,240 --> 05:31:21,860
Maybe I was not locked in.

5757
05:31:23,280 --> 05:31:25,420
Maybe I was not locked in, guys.

5758
05:31:27,400 --> 05:31:28,900
Can you really blame me?

5759
05:31:28,980 --> 05:31:30,220
I have to fight Lupo.

5760
05:31:32,740 --> 05:31:34,460
Oh my god.

5761
05:31:36,140 --> 05:31:37,240
Can you really blame me?

5762
05:31:37,240 --> 05:31:38,900
I have to fight this fucker!

5763
05:31:44,440 --> 05:31:47,240
Wait, do I have any items?

5764
05:31:47,340 --> 05:31:47,840
Oh my god, wait.

5765
05:31:48,000 --> 05:31:49,540
I think I have extra items.

5766
05:31:49,660 --> 05:31:50,320
Wait, I'm so dumb.

5767
05:31:51,060 --> 05:31:52,380
This last minute, no item run.

5768
05:31:52,500 --> 05:31:53,040
Wait a minute.

5769
05:31:55,820 --> 05:31:56,940
Wait a minute.

5770
05:31:58,640 --> 05:31:59,920
I should have...

5771
05:31:59,920 --> 05:32:02,280
Wait, where are my items?

5772
05:32:02,740 --> 05:32:04,700
Oh my god, I didn't equip any.

5773
05:32:04,700 --> 05:32:06,660
I didn't equip any.

5774
05:32:06,980 --> 05:32:08,700
I'm so...

5775
05:32:08,700 --> 05:32:09,640
Oh no.

5776
05:32:10,980 --> 05:32:12,140
Nevermind, guys.

5777
05:32:12,320 --> 05:32:13,720
Okay, we gotta redo this.

5778
05:32:13,840 --> 05:32:14,760
We're redoing this.

5779
05:32:15,240 --> 05:32:16,340
I'm redoing this.

5780
05:32:16,600 --> 05:32:19,320
I'm already like...

5781
05:32:19,320 --> 05:32:20,580
Just kill me.

5782
05:32:20,720 --> 05:32:21,380
Reset this.

5783
05:32:21,520 --> 05:32:22,260
Restart this.

5784
05:32:22,820 --> 05:32:23,980
Restart this.

5785
05:32:25,620 --> 05:32:28,080
Real gamers don't use items.

5786
05:32:28,820 --> 05:32:30,960
Damn you, Pastuki!

5787
05:32:30,960 --> 05:32:31,640
Why?

5788
05:32:33,300 --> 05:32:35,900
Why didn't you have any items?

5789
05:32:37,800 --> 05:32:38,140
Okay.

5790
05:32:38,560 --> 05:32:39,540
I'm gonna go silent mode.

5791
05:32:39,620 --> 05:32:40,200
I have to try.

5792
05:32:41,860 --> 05:32:42,380
Okay.

5793
05:32:43,180 --> 05:32:43,840
Okay.

5794
05:32:44,980 --> 05:32:45,980
Go focus.

5795
05:32:52,030 --> 05:32:52,690
Okay!

5796
05:32:57,690 --> 05:32:59,290
We all know that was bullshit.

5797
05:32:59,470 --> 05:33:00,290
That was so bullshit.

5798
05:33:00,430 --> 05:33:01,930
That was actually so bullshit.

5799
05:33:01,930 --> 05:33:03,610
That was...

5800
05:33:03,610 --> 05:33:05,670
That was actually so bullshit.

5801
05:33:07,330 --> 05:33:08,450
Oh my god.

5802
05:33:08,610 --> 05:33:12,030
I perfect evaded that and it counted as a hit.

5803
05:33:17,930 --> 05:33:18,650
Alright.

5804
05:33:32,430 --> 05:33:33,830
Oh.

5805
05:33:37,310 --> 05:33:40,110
Come on.

5806
05:33:43,070 --> 05:33:43,610
Alright.

5807
05:33:48,630 --> 05:33:49,330
Alright.

5808
05:33:54,690 --> 05:33:58,810
I don't feel like I got this anymore.

5809
05:34:01,930 --> 05:34:02,490
Lock in.

5810
05:34:02,670 --> 05:34:02,850
Lock in.

5811
05:34:07,350 --> 05:34:09,370
I hate you.

5812
05:34:09,590 --> 05:34:12,250
I hate you so much!

5813
05:34:14,730 --> 05:34:15,650
Damn.

5814
05:34:34,590 --> 05:34:36,030
Take that!

5815
05:34:37,870 --> 05:34:38,970
Ready up!

5816
05:34:41,950 --> 05:34:43,030
You're finished!

5817
05:34:45,110 --> 05:34:46,190
Time to act.

5818
05:34:53,350 --> 05:34:53,710
Be

5819
05:35:01,610 --> 05:35:07,330
proud of your strength, but there are so few who can fare this well against me.

5820
05:35:08,430 --> 05:35:12,630
Now I shall allow you to bear witness to the entirety of my might.

5821
05:35:12,970 --> 05:35:13,270
You're finished.

5822
05:35:19,390 --> 05:35:20,510
Ready yourself.

5823
05:35:26,410 --> 05:35:27,370
Looking rough.

5824
05:35:29,870 --> 05:35:31,930
I need to use that as like...

5825
05:35:32,470 --> 05:35:32,810
Okay.

5826
05:35:33,430 --> 05:35:35,090
I need to use it as like a defense.

5827
05:35:35,490 --> 05:35:36,290
Gotta be quicker.

5828
05:35:39,670 --> 05:35:40,550
Oh.

5829
05:35:41,070 --> 05:35:41,510
Alright.

5830
05:35:46,680 --> 05:35:47,280
Oh.

5831
05:35:50,950 --> 05:35:51,730
What's he doing?

5832
05:35:52,350 --> 05:35:53,110
What is he doing?

5833
05:35:54,130 --> 05:35:55,010
I'm

5834
05:36:02,040 --> 05:36:02,960
so confused!

5835
05:36:04,340 --> 05:36:06,160
I'm so sad.

5836
05:36:08,670 --> 05:36:09,690
I'm so sad.

5837
05:36:09,850 --> 05:36:11,930
I hate this guy so much.

5838
05:36:17,730 --> 05:36:19,530
I didn't know!

5839
05:36:22,150 --> 05:36:23,570
I didn't know!

5840
05:36:26,270 --> 05:36:26,810
You're finished.

5841
05:36:28,050 --> 05:36:29,070
You're finished.

5842
05:36:29,630 --> 05:36:30,710
This guy sucks.

5843
05:36:31,490 --> 05:36:33,290
I'm like Dark Soulings right now.

5844
05:36:34,530 --> 05:36:37,430
I have the Dark Souls in my Dynasty Warriors game.

5845
05:36:39,030 --> 05:36:40,030
Take that!

5846
05:36:40,910 --> 05:36:42,230
This is not fair.

5847
05:36:43,650 --> 05:36:44,850
With all my might.

5848
05:36:51,240 --> 05:36:52,760
I don't...

5849
05:37:05,770 --> 05:37:07,650
What is this fight?

5850
05:37:08,250 --> 05:37:10,790
What the fuck is this fight?

5851
05:37:13,380 --> 05:37:14,620
Okay, end me.

5852
05:37:16,040 --> 05:37:17,160
I'm finished.

5853
05:37:18,060 --> 05:37:21,220
This is like the worst save point I have.

5854
05:37:21,980 --> 05:37:24,660
That's actually the worst save point it gave me.

5855
05:37:24,780 --> 05:37:25,560
I hate this.

5856
05:37:25,800 --> 05:37:28,140
I hate this save point.

5857
05:37:29,160 --> 05:37:29,380
Alright.

5858
05:37:30,720 --> 05:37:31,440
Alright.

5859
05:37:31,440 --> 05:37:32,900
I can't.

5860
05:37:34,100 --> 05:37:36,620
It's always a different one the entire time.

5861
05:37:39,420 --> 05:37:41,040
It's always a different save point.

5862
05:37:41,080 --> 05:37:42,140
That's the worst part.

5863
05:37:47,720 --> 05:37:49,340
Okay, full focus.

5864
05:37:51,720 --> 05:37:53,000
Jesus Christ.

5865
05:37:54,060 --> 05:37:55,380
I feel so finished.

5866
05:38:02,340 --> 05:38:04,280
With all my might.

5867
05:38:06,960 --> 05:38:07,340
Full focus.

5868
05:38:09,460 --> 05:38:11,380
I need to dodge it when he's at...

5869
05:38:11,380 --> 05:38:15,120
Christ, whenever he does that, it's so scary.

5870
05:38:17,840 --> 05:38:18,680
Take that.

5871
05:38:21,660 --> 05:38:21,940
Jesus.

5872
05:38:23,160 --> 05:38:23,820
Okay.

5873
05:38:24,600 --> 05:38:25,200
You're finished.

5874
05:38:26,240 --> 05:38:27,240
Time to attack.

5875
05:38:28,540 --> 05:38:29,580
Ready yourself.

5876
05:38:29,580 --> 05:38:32,020
Jesus Christ.

5877
05:38:32,120 --> 05:38:32,560
Really?

5878
05:38:34,180 --> 05:38:34,660
Time to attack.

5879
05:38:35,440 --> 05:38:35,680
Okay.

5880
05:38:39,180 --> 05:38:39,960
Oh my god.

5881
05:38:40,460 --> 05:38:40,780
Okay.

5882
05:38:42,520 --> 05:38:43,860
The counter.

5883
05:38:44,020 --> 05:38:47,380
The counter shit is actually... Oh my god.

5884
05:38:47,420 --> 05:38:48,820
It's actually...

5885
05:38:49,460 --> 05:38:51,360
Oh my god.

5886
05:38:52,040 --> 05:38:53,100
That's it.

5887
05:38:53,220 --> 05:38:53,720
I'm...

5888
05:38:53,720 --> 05:38:55,500
I'm using a different weapon.

5889
05:38:58,680 --> 05:38:59,560
I'm...

5890
05:38:59,560 --> 05:39:01,140
I'm using this.

5891
05:39:02,080 --> 05:39:03,480
Okay.

5892
05:39:07,420 --> 05:39:09,520
I'm using this.

5893
05:39:10,100 --> 05:39:11,120
Come on.

5894
05:39:14,060 --> 05:39:15,460
Okay.

5895
05:39:18,100 --> 05:39:19,500
Okay.

5896
05:39:20,360 --> 05:39:20,600
Okay.

5897
05:39:25,560 --> 05:39:26,980
Oh my god.

5898
05:39:28,080 --> 05:39:28,540
What?

5899
05:39:28,760 --> 05:39:29,260
Oh my god.

5900
05:39:29,340 --> 05:39:29,740
My rage.

5901
05:39:30,040 --> 05:39:30,820
My rage.

5902
05:39:30,920 --> 05:39:31,180
Okay.

5903
05:39:31,260 --> 05:39:32,540
Maybe not this weapon.

5904
05:39:32,620 --> 05:39:33,520
I'm not used to it.

5905
05:39:33,620 --> 05:39:34,260
Maybe... Okay.

5906
05:39:34,340 --> 05:39:35,080
I'm resetting.

5907
05:39:35,200 --> 05:39:36,120
I'm resetting.

5908
05:39:36,180 --> 05:39:36,960
I'm resetting.

5909
05:39:37,320 --> 05:39:38,280
I'm resetting.

5910
05:39:38,400 --> 05:39:39,420
I wasn't ready guys.

5911
05:39:39,520 --> 05:39:40,360
I wasn't ready.

5912
05:39:40,740 --> 05:39:41,800
I wasn't...

5913
05:39:45,320 --> 05:39:46,620
I wasn't ready.

5914
05:39:48,320 --> 05:39:48,780
Jesus.

5915
05:39:48,980 --> 05:39:49,620
I hate that.

5916
05:39:49,700 --> 05:39:50,920
I hate...

5917
05:39:50,920 --> 05:39:51,960
Oh shit.

5918
05:39:52,020 --> 05:39:52,260
Okay.

5919
05:39:52,560 --> 05:39:55,560
I keep forgetting that I'm not on the right weapons right now.

5920
05:40:00,860 --> 05:40:01,560
Okay.

5921
05:40:03,060 --> 05:40:04,460
Alright.

5922
05:40:11,520 --> 05:40:12,920
Okay.

5923
05:40:14,120 --> 05:40:14,660
Nice.

5924
05:40:18,820 --> 05:40:19,160
Okay.

5925
05:40:22,340 --> 05:40:23,380
Come on.

5926
05:40:25,980 --> 05:40:27,380
Okay.

5927
05:40:31,760 --> 05:40:32,520
Concentrate.

5928
05:40:42,100 --> 05:40:43,620
Jesus Christ.

5929
05:40:46,260 --> 05:40:48,380
Bro, when he does his own thing.

5930
05:40:48,720 --> 05:40:50,380
Like, I don't know.

5931
05:40:53,760 --> 05:40:54,520
No.

5932
05:40:54,520 --> 05:40:55,160
No!

5933
05:40:58,580 --> 05:40:59,120
No!

5934
05:41:00,140 --> 05:41:00,680
Okay.

5935
05:41:05,160 --> 05:41:06,240
I think...

5936
05:41:06,240 --> 05:41:08,520
Okay, I think...

5937
05:41:10,640 --> 05:41:11,660
I don't know.

5938
05:41:11,840 --> 05:41:12,940
Actually, I don't know.

5939
05:41:13,080 --> 05:41:13,800
I don't know.

5940
05:41:13,960 --> 05:41:14,880
I don't know.

5941
05:41:14,980 --> 05:41:15,540
I don't know.

5942
05:41:15,620 --> 05:41:16,200
I don't know.

5943
05:41:16,400 --> 05:41:16,980
I don't...

5944
05:41:17,720 --> 05:41:18,260
What?

5945
05:41:20,160 --> 05:41:21,200
I don't know.

5946
05:41:21,300 --> 05:41:22,080
I can't think.

5947
05:41:27,180 --> 05:41:28,600
I don't know.

5948
05:41:28,720 --> 05:41:30,480
I don't know anymore.

5949
05:41:30,680 --> 05:41:31,960
I don't know.

5950
05:41:32,020 --> 05:41:32,740
I don't know.

5951
05:41:35,360 --> 05:41:39,500
I don't think... I don't think anymore.

5952
05:41:45,840 --> 05:41:52,800
Oh my god, I can parry his parry?!

5953
05:41:52,800 --> 05:41:53,820
Wait, what?!

5954
05:41:54,540 --> 05:41:55,840
Okay, now I know!

5955
05:41:57,200 --> 05:41:59,020
Okay, I can parry his parry.

5956
05:42:00,180 --> 05:42:01,380
Jesus Christ.

5957
05:42:01,500 --> 05:42:02,300
Okay, it doesn't matter.

5958
05:42:04,420 --> 05:42:05,540
It doesn't matter.

5959
05:42:10,480 --> 05:42:12,240
Okay, at least now I know.

5960
05:42:16,760 --> 05:42:18,480
Oh my god.

5961
05:42:19,920 --> 05:42:22,880
Oh my god, I just keep being finished.

5962
05:42:24,520 --> 05:42:25,080
Where is he?

5963
05:42:29,440 --> 05:42:32,120
I don't know if this is better or not.

5964
05:42:32,200 --> 05:42:32,980
I can't tell.

5965
05:42:37,740 --> 05:42:38,700
Jesus Christ.

5966
05:42:40,440 --> 05:42:41,960
I don't know which weapon is better.

5967
05:42:45,180 --> 05:42:46,260
I can't tell.

5968
05:42:47,500 --> 05:42:48,400
I can't tell.

5969
05:42:51,000 --> 05:42:53,880
Maybe this one because I break it faster.

5970
05:42:56,340 --> 05:42:57,700
I break it faster.

5971
05:42:57,900 --> 05:42:58,860
Okay, focus.

5972
05:43:02,360 --> 05:43:05,080
Jesus Christ, I'm trying to like...

5973
05:43:11,020 --> 05:43:12,840
I can't parry with this stuff.

5974
05:43:12,860 --> 05:43:14,480
I'm so bad at parrying with the spear.

5975
05:43:17,580 --> 05:43:19,420
I don't know how to parry with spear.

5976
05:43:21,880 --> 05:43:23,680
I'm better parrying with...

5977
05:43:26,620 --> 05:43:27,500
Jesus!

5978
05:43:31,660 --> 05:43:34,540
I don't know how to parry with the spear.

5979
05:43:37,140 --> 05:43:37,600
Okay.

5980
05:43:40,380 --> 05:43:41,780
He's gonna grab me.

5981
05:43:42,820 --> 05:43:44,560
He was gonna grab me.

5982
05:43:47,920 --> 05:43:48,360
Alright.

5983
05:43:52,040 --> 05:43:52,300
Yes.

5984
05:43:53,760 --> 05:43:55,700
Oh my god, I don't know how to do it.

5985
05:43:56,240 --> 05:43:57,300
I'm not gonna try.

5986
05:44:03,500 --> 05:44:03,860
Okay.

5987
05:44:19,010 --> 05:44:19,370
Okay.

5988
05:44:21,710 --> 05:44:22,830
He has to run into this.

5989
05:44:23,850 --> 05:44:24,210
Fuck!

5990
05:44:24,350 --> 05:44:25,770
See, I don't know how to do it!

5991
05:44:29,770 --> 05:44:30,130
Okay.

5992
05:44:31,910 --> 05:44:34,490
I don't know how to parry with my spear!

5993
05:44:34,630 --> 05:44:35,890
I don't know!

5994
05:44:38,630 --> 05:44:41,190
I'm so bad at it!

5995
05:44:44,010 --> 05:44:44,730
Oh no.

5996
05:44:45,150 --> 05:44:46,350
Jesus Christ.

5997
05:44:50,190 --> 05:44:51,110
Whoa.

5998
05:44:59,210 --> 05:44:59,990
Whoa.

5999
05:45:04,310 --> 05:45:05,090
Oh.

6000
05:45:07,590 --> 05:45:08,370
Whoa.

6001
05:45:11,770 --> 05:45:12,870
Oh, nice!

6002
05:45:19,130 --> 05:45:20,490
Oh, fuck!

6003
05:45:26,450 --> 05:45:27,470
Oh, fuck.

6004
05:45:27,550 --> 05:45:27,870
Okay, okay.

6005
05:45:28,990 --> 05:45:29,770
Okay.

6006
05:45:38,500 --> 05:45:38,860
Ah!

6007
05:45:43,960 --> 05:45:45,260
Please get near this.

6008
05:45:45,420 --> 05:45:46,160
Please get near this.

6009
05:45:46,580 --> 05:45:46,900
Ah!

6010
05:45:47,500 --> 05:45:47,860
Ah!

6011
05:45:54,720 --> 05:45:55,440
No!

6012
05:46:01,600 --> 05:46:02,280
Jesus Christ.

6013
05:46:07,760 --> 05:46:08,440
Okay.

6014
05:46:17,230 --> 05:46:19,020
I jumped!

6015
05:46:20,290 --> 05:46:22,360
People told me to jump!

6016
05:46:27,510 --> 05:46:29,320
I don't jump!

6017
05:46:32,160 --> 05:46:34,660
You mean they lied?!

6018
05:46:38,390 --> 05:46:39,600
Oh my god.

6019
05:46:40,360 --> 05:46:41,640
I got lied to.

6020
05:46:41,640 --> 05:46:43,760
I got fed bad intel.

6021
05:46:44,280 --> 05:46:46,300
They told me to just jump.

6022
05:46:46,420 --> 05:46:47,440
Just jump, forehead.

6023
05:46:47,980 --> 05:46:49,640
I'm restarting this one.

6024
05:46:50,660 --> 05:46:51,600
They lie.

6025
05:46:52,120 --> 05:46:52,860
They lie.

6026
05:46:53,760 --> 05:46:54,640
They lie.

6027
05:46:56,920 --> 05:46:58,860
They're like, just jump!

6028
05:46:59,660 --> 05:47:00,720
Just jump!

6029
05:47:02,080 --> 05:47:03,940
Just fucking jump!

6030
05:47:05,640 --> 05:47:07,920
Just jump, guys!

6031
05:47:08,540 --> 05:47:10,580
That's all you have to do!

6032
05:47:11,640 --> 05:47:13,660
Just jump, doki!

6033
05:47:17,460 --> 05:47:19,600
That's all you have to do!

6034
05:47:20,000 --> 05:47:21,020
Jesus Christ.

6035
05:47:29,140 --> 05:47:29,920
Jesus!

6036
05:47:32,900 --> 05:47:33,880
I hate this look.

6037
05:47:37,280 --> 05:47:38,060
Okay.

6038
05:47:43,380 --> 05:47:44,640
It's not over yet.

6039
05:48:01,350 --> 05:48:02,110
Fucking hell.

6040
05:48:02,330 --> 05:48:02,950
I hate this guy.

6041
05:48:03,090 --> 05:48:03,270
I hate him.

6042
05:48:03,350 --> 05:48:03,630
I hate him.

6043
05:48:03,670 --> 05:48:04,310
I hate him.

6044
05:48:04,430 --> 05:48:04,670
I hate him.

6045
05:48:04,790 --> 05:48:05,570
I hate him.

6046
05:48:06,450 --> 05:48:07,310
I hate him!

6047
05:48:08,310 --> 05:48:08,850
I hate him!

6048
05:48:10,750 --> 05:48:11,510
God, please!

6049
05:48:11,590 --> 05:48:13,310
I don't want to be finished!

6050
05:48:13,410 --> 05:48:13,790
Please!

6051
05:48:17,570 --> 05:48:18,090
Jesus!

6052
05:48:18,390 --> 05:48:18,550
Ah!

6053
05:48:25,330 --> 05:48:27,150
Oh my god, I hate you.

6054
05:48:28,050 --> 05:48:29,270
I hate you so much.

6055
05:48:33,870 --> 05:48:34,890
I run.

6056
05:48:39,890 --> 05:48:41,010
Oh my god, I run.

6057
05:48:43,870 --> 05:48:44,650
I'm so mad.

6058
05:48:44,730 --> 05:48:45,190
I'm so mad.

6059
05:48:45,230 --> 05:48:45,750
I'm so mad.

6060
05:48:45,790 --> 05:48:46,350
I'm so mad.

6061
05:48:46,830 --> 05:48:47,650
I'm so mad.

6062
05:48:47,730 --> 05:48:48,270
I'm so mad.

6063
05:48:48,310 --> 05:48:48,890
I'm so mad.

6064
05:48:48,930 --> 05:48:49,470
I'm so mad.

6065
05:48:49,550 --> 05:48:50,010
I'm so mad.

6066
05:48:50,050 --> 05:48:51,070
Why is he so strong?

6067
05:48:51,490 --> 05:48:52,490
Why is he...

6068
05:48:56,450 --> 05:48:57,750
Why is he so strong?

6069
05:49:04,510 --> 05:49:05,310
I don't...

6070
05:49:06,170 --> 05:49:08,010
I don't want to be finished!

6071
05:49:08,010 --> 05:49:10,470
Oh my god.

6072
05:49:13,870 --> 05:49:16,450
The tornado is so strong though.

6073
05:49:16,550 --> 05:49:17,870
What do you fucking have?

6074
05:49:18,790 --> 05:49:21,210
It breaks the thing easier for me.

6075
05:49:23,070 --> 05:49:25,650
It helps me break the thing.

6076
05:49:28,990 --> 05:49:29,450
Nice.

6077
05:49:37,410 --> 05:49:39,210
Oh shit.

6078
05:49:39,390 --> 05:49:40,010
Oh shit!

6079
05:49:40,510 --> 05:49:41,750
Oh my god!

6080
05:49:43,430 --> 05:49:44,710
I hate this.

6081
05:49:47,790 --> 05:49:48,690
I'm...

6082
05:49:48,690 --> 05:49:49,610
Alright, end me.

6083
05:49:50,490 --> 05:49:50,910
End me.

6084
05:49:51,670 --> 05:49:52,390
End me.

6085
05:49:52,790 --> 05:49:54,170
End me!

6086
05:49:56,930 --> 05:49:59,810
This is like the worst fight ever.

6087
05:50:00,170 --> 05:50:04,190
It sucks because I'm like locked into like an easy...

6088
05:50:04,190 --> 05:50:07,530
He has like one easy fucking damage on me.

6089
05:50:08,510 --> 05:50:09,930
That's the worst part.

6090
05:50:14,270 --> 05:50:17,610
Okay, what if... Okay, is there any other gun?

6091
05:50:18,090 --> 05:50:19,530
Alright, 218.

6092
05:50:19,590 --> 05:50:21,530
No, that is literally my strongest weapon.

6093
05:50:21,530 --> 05:50:22,890
Oh my god.

6094
05:50:22,930 --> 05:50:24,370
Okay, what if I use this?

6095
05:50:25,150 --> 05:50:26,710
What if it's Twin Peaks time?

6096
05:50:28,890 --> 05:50:30,790
Maybe I'm just a Twin Peak user.

6097
05:50:32,930 --> 05:50:34,030
Maybe that's it.

6098
05:50:36,210 --> 05:50:37,350
Maybe that's it.

6099
05:50:38,050 --> 05:50:39,750
Oh my god, maybe it's not.

6100
05:50:40,190 --> 05:50:41,310
Guys, maybe it's not.

6101
05:50:42,390 --> 05:50:43,570
Maybe it's not.

6102
05:50:45,290 --> 05:50:46,470
I can't tell.

6103
05:50:49,390 --> 05:50:50,690
I can't tell.

6104
05:50:54,090 --> 05:50:54,570
Okay.

6105
05:51:00,910 --> 05:51:03,150
I can't tell if I'm doing better or not.

6106
05:51:06,350 --> 05:51:08,130
Oh, I wish Gohan was still here.

6107
05:51:08,750 --> 05:51:10,630
I wish I still had more buttons.

6108
05:51:10,750 --> 05:51:11,610
I really do.

6109
05:51:18,530 --> 05:51:19,490
Oh, fuck!

6110
05:51:19,490 --> 05:51:19,510
Fuck!

6111
05:51:27,460 --> 05:51:29,180
Oh my god.

6112
05:51:30,740 --> 05:51:31,060
No!

6113
05:51:36,540 --> 05:51:39,940
The reason why I use the tornado is I break shields so fast.

6114
05:51:42,120 --> 05:51:45,660
See, like his shield's almost broken already.

6115
05:51:48,520 --> 05:51:49,520
See, look.

6116
05:51:49,780 --> 05:51:50,620
His shield's broken.

6117
05:51:53,040 --> 05:51:56,560
It's already broken, so I feel like I have to use the spear.

6118
05:52:09,400 --> 05:52:09,940
Yeah.

6119
05:52:13,180 --> 05:52:13,540
Yeah.

6120
05:52:15,900 --> 05:52:16,820
Jesus Christ.

6121
05:52:18,780 --> 05:52:19,320
Whoa!

6122
05:52:19,320 --> 05:52:20,560
I feel the same way.

6123
05:52:26,060 --> 05:52:26,720
Oh.

6124
05:52:26,880 --> 05:52:29,580
I wish my dragoons were still fighting this fight with me.

6125
05:52:32,460 --> 05:52:34,520
And instead, they ran away.

6126
05:52:35,480 --> 05:52:37,980
I'm so sad they ran away, guys.

6127
05:52:40,350 --> 05:52:43,360
I wish my dragoons were still fighting.

6128
05:52:44,620 --> 05:52:45,520
Hahaha.

6129
05:52:47,000 --> 05:52:49,780
My dragoons ran away.

6130
05:52:55,680 --> 05:52:58,020
Guys, why did you run?

6131
05:52:58,800 --> 05:53:00,840
Why weren't you there with me?

6132
05:53:03,040 --> 05:53:03,940
Hahaha.

6133
05:53:05,100 --> 05:53:05,760
Hang on.

6134
05:53:10,420 --> 05:53:11,620
Jesus Christ.

6135
05:53:11,760 --> 05:53:12,800
I messed it up.

6136
05:53:13,960 --> 05:53:15,100
Oh shit.

6137
05:53:15,480 --> 05:53:15,940
No!

6138
05:53:16,920 --> 05:53:19,080
I thought it was orange!

6139
05:53:19,680 --> 05:53:21,560
I thought it was orange.

6140
05:53:23,080 --> 05:53:27,460
God, how long am I gonna fight this guy?

6141
05:53:33,390 --> 05:53:35,220
Oh my god.

6142
05:53:37,860 --> 05:53:40,560
How long am I gonna fight him?

6143
05:53:42,800 --> 05:53:43,300
Jesus.

6144
05:53:45,000 --> 05:53:45,480
Okay.

6145
05:53:52,950 --> 05:53:53,670
Okay.

6146
05:54:02,470 --> 05:54:03,410
I can't.

6147
05:54:03,430 --> 05:54:03,970
I can't.

6148
05:54:03,990 --> 05:54:04,530
I can't.

6149
05:54:04,770 --> 05:54:05,130
I can't!

6150
05:54:05,830 --> 05:54:06,190
Fuck!

6151
05:54:07,710 --> 05:54:08,870
I have to restart.

6152
05:54:08,990 --> 05:54:09,550
I have to restart.

6153
05:54:10,710 --> 05:54:13,490
I have to restart.

6154
05:54:15,230 --> 05:54:15,950
Okay.

6155
05:54:19,030 --> 05:54:20,430
Okay.

6156
05:54:20,430 --> 05:54:21,990
Here we go.

6157
05:54:30,700 --> 05:54:31,420
Okay.

6158
05:54:38,130 --> 05:54:39,530
Okay.

6159
05:54:44,970 --> 05:54:46,370
Damn.

6160
05:54:53,770 --> 05:54:54,470
My...

6161
05:54:55,170 --> 05:54:56,230
Okay.

6162
05:54:58,570 --> 05:54:58,890
Okay.

6163
05:55:03,700 --> 05:55:05,860
You sent him in the air.

6164
05:55:18,530 --> 05:55:19,210
Oh!

6165
05:55:19,610 --> 05:55:20,190
Oh!

6166
05:55:22,590 --> 05:55:23,010
Oh!

6167
05:55:27,340 --> 05:55:27,460
Oh!

6168
05:55:29,660 --> 05:55:29,920
Yeah.

6169
05:55:30,160 --> 05:55:30,840
Yeah, no shit.

6170
05:55:31,380 --> 05:55:33,640
No shit is looking fucking rough!

6171
05:55:38,460 --> 05:55:40,720
Yeah, thanks for telling me that!

6172
05:55:41,720 --> 05:55:42,440
Ah!

6173
05:55:48,720 --> 05:55:50,120
Oh.

6174
05:55:55,890 --> 05:55:57,570
Oh my god.

6175
05:56:13,430 --> 05:56:13,590
Okay.

6176
05:56:18,060 --> 05:56:18,750
No!

6177
05:56:22,570 --> 05:56:23,950
Oh.

6178
05:56:30,920 --> 05:56:31,610
No!

6179
05:56:32,050 --> 05:56:33,050
I dodged!

6180
05:56:33,050 --> 05:56:36,250
I fucked up the dodge timing!

6181
05:56:38,090 --> 05:56:39,750
I fucked it up.

6182
05:56:42,150 --> 05:56:42,650
Ah!

6183
05:56:49,370 --> 05:56:50,610
I'm full focus now.

6184
05:56:50,830 --> 05:56:52,310
Okay, I'm actually full focus now.

6185
05:56:53,690 --> 05:56:53,850
Damn.

6186
05:57:01,120 --> 05:57:01,840
Come on.

6187
05:57:01,880 --> 05:57:01,920
Come on.

6188
05:57:01,920 --> 05:57:02,260
Come on.

6189
05:57:12,760 --> 05:57:13,260
Nice.

6190
05:57:19,160 --> 05:57:20,760
I see it.

6191
05:57:26,240 --> 05:57:27,560
Fucking whore.

6192
05:57:27,840 --> 05:57:28,820
You fucking whore!

6193
05:57:29,060 --> 05:57:32,340
Why do you get that attack off?!

6194
05:57:33,240 --> 05:57:36,340
Are you serious?!

6195
05:57:41,160 --> 05:57:42,040
Ah!

6196
05:57:42,040 --> 05:57:42,740
Ah!

6197
05:57:45,160 --> 05:57:46,540
Just end me.

6198
05:57:47,180 --> 05:57:48,100
Just end me.

6199
05:57:49,020 --> 05:57:49,740
Just end me.

6200
05:57:50,320 --> 05:57:51,280
I'm finished.

6201
05:57:51,580 --> 05:57:52,200
I'm finished.

6202
05:57:52,420 --> 05:57:53,020
Just end me.

6203
05:57:53,260 --> 05:57:55,180
Just end me.

6204
05:57:59,620 --> 05:58:00,580
No!

6205
05:58:02,300 --> 05:58:04,100
We are not restarting!

6206
05:58:05,080 --> 05:58:06,460
I believe!

6207
05:58:09,100 --> 05:58:09,500
Okay.

6208
05:58:09,500 --> 05:58:09,900
Okay.

6209
05:58:10,180 --> 05:58:10,580
Restart.

6210
05:58:10,720 --> 05:58:11,120
Restart.

6211
05:58:11,340 --> 05:58:13,300
I believe after we restart.

6212
05:58:13,540 --> 05:58:13,820
Restart.

6213
05:58:13,900 --> 05:58:14,660
Just hit me once.

6214
05:58:15,260 --> 05:58:16,500
Just hit me once.

6215
05:58:16,720 --> 05:58:17,720
Just hit me once.

6216
05:58:17,880 --> 05:58:19,040
Just hit me one more time.

6217
05:58:19,180 --> 05:58:19,360
Alright.

6218
05:58:20,700 --> 05:58:21,100
Alright.

6219
05:58:21,100 --> 05:58:21,960
We can do this.

6220
05:58:22,000 --> 05:58:22,520
We can do this.

6221
05:58:22,540 --> 05:58:23,060
We can do this.

6222
05:58:23,080 --> 05:58:24,280
We don't need buns.

6223
05:58:24,360 --> 05:58:25,060
We don't need musou.

6224
05:58:25,320 --> 05:58:26,300
We can do this.

6225
05:58:34,570 --> 05:58:34,970
Okay.

6226
05:58:40,630 --> 05:58:41,390
Jesus Christ.

6227
05:58:43,130 --> 05:58:43,650
Two.

6228
05:58:47,410 --> 05:58:48,290
Oh, I see you.

6229
05:58:48,710 --> 05:58:49,010
Easy.

6230
05:58:52,770 --> 05:58:55,430
Are you serious?!

6231
05:58:55,430 --> 05:58:56,010
Time to attack.

6232
05:58:56,290 --> 05:58:56,710
Ready up.

6233
05:58:57,350 --> 05:58:58,170
I see it.

6234
05:59:03,590 --> 05:59:04,270
Take that.

6235
05:59:04,270 --> 05:59:06,270
Take that.

6236
05:59:14,110 --> 05:59:15,230
Come on.

6237
05:59:15,790 --> 05:59:16,370
Come on.

6238
05:59:16,370 --> 05:59:16,570
Come on.

6239
05:59:16,690 --> 05:59:16,690
Come on.

6240
05:59:16,710 --> 05:59:16,710
Come on.

6241
05:59:20,970 --> 05:59:21,530
What?!

6242
05:59:21,530 --> 05:59:23,910
That hits me?!

6243
05:59:23,910 --> 05:59:24,550
Alright.

6244
05:59:24,650 --> 05:59:25,030
It's over.

6245
05:59:28,170 --> 05:59:30,230
It was not supposed to hit me there.

6246
05:59:40,640 --> 05:59:41,320
Okay.

6247
05:59:45,380 --> 05:59:46,720
The timing!

6248
05:59:47,120 --> 05:59:47,840
The timing!

6249
05:59:50,520 --> 05:59:51,020
Okay.

6250
05:59:52,600 --> 05:59:53,960
Jesus Christ.

6251
05:59:53,980 --> 05:59:54,720
I hate this.

6252
05:59:55,060 --> 05:59:58,660
I hate this part because he like softlocked me into that.

6253
05:59:59,520 --> 06:00:00,940
It's actually not fair.

6254
06:00:04,220 --> 06:00:06,860
So I'm like taking a free hit almost every time.

6255
06:00:10,360 --> 06:00:11,300
Time to act.

6256
06:00:12,620 --> 06:00:13,620
This is why I use the tornado.

6257
06:00:16,680 --> 06:00:19,760
Yeah, that is actually the worst checkpoint I could get.

6258
06:00:25,320 --> 06:00:30,880
Here we go.

6259
06:00:32,820 --> 06:00:33,640
Time to act.

6260
06:00:36,100 --> 06:00:36,620
Time

6261
06:00:44,700 --> 06:00:45,020
to attack.

6262
06:00:46,020 --> 06:00:47,080
No.

6263
06:00:49,100 --> 06:00:51,020
Here we go.

6264
06:01:03,960 --> 06:01:04,660
Okay.

6265
06:01:07,720 --> 06:01:09,120
Okay.

6266
06:01:15,020 --> 06:01:15,660
Time to turn the tables.

6267
06:01:19,360 --> 06:01:21,360
Take this.

6268
06:01:22,280 --> 06:01:23,240
With all my might.

6269
06:01:29,720 --> 06:01:30,440
Time to attack.

6270
06:01:33,920 --> 06:01:36,480
Time to act.

6271
06:01:44,020 --> 06:01:46,220
Time to attack.

6272
06:01:49,720 --> 06:01:51,380
What the?!

6273
06:01:51,780 --> 06:01:52,880
That was an accident!

6274
06:01:53,040 --> 06:01:54,180
It was actually an accident!

6275
06:01:55,320 --> 06:01:57,520
I'm so bad!

6276
06:02:02,600 --> 06:02:04,520
A horse!

6277
06:02:09,650 --> 06:02:12,830
It was such a good ride!

6278
06:02:13,750 --> 06:02:17,310
The horse is binded to my left analog stick.

6279
06:02:18,150 --> 06:02:19,970
And I actually pressed it!

6280
06:02:20,170 --> 06:02:24,270
If you press the left analog stick, it like activates the horse.

6281
06:02:26,170 --> 06:02:30,270
Oh my god, that was such a good fucking ride!

6282
06:02:33,350 --> 06:02:34,710
Jesus Christ.

6283
06:02:38,050 --> 06:02:40,690
That was actually such a good ride.

6284
06:02:40,990 --> 06:02:44,150
If you press down, it like activates it.

6285
06:02:46,750 --> 06:02:47,890
That's what happened.

6286
06:02:49,750 --> 06:02:53,170
I was like, it was such an intense fight, I actually pressed down.

6287
06:03:04,690 --> 06:03:05,210
Okay.

6288
06:03:15,830 --> 06:03:17,190
Gotta be quicker.

6289
06:03:22,150 --> 06:03:23,290
Time to act.

6290
06:03:32,930 --> 06:03:34,390
With all my might.

6291
06:03:49,930 --> 06:03:52,850
Time to act.

6292
06:03:54,410 --> 06:03:55,670
Ready yourself.

6293
06:04:01,470 --> 06:04:02,030
Time to attack.

6294
06:04:05,930 --> 06:04:06,950
You're finished.

6295
06:04:08,790 --> 06:04:09,810
You're finished.

6296
06:04:10,630 --> 06:04:12,150
You're finished.

6297
06:04:14,610 --> 06:04:15,710
Time to act.

6298
06:04:17,850 --> 06:04:19,270
Time to act.

6299
06:04:19,850 --> 06:04:21,970
Time to attack.

6300
06:04:21,970 --> 06:04:22,730
Nice.

6301
06:04:33,620 --> 06:04:36,020
What the?!

6302
06:04:36,760 --> 06:04:38,900
How do you dodge that?!

6303
06:04:38,900 --> 06:04:40,200
What the?!

6304
06:04:40,880 --> 06:04:42,600
How do you dodge it?!

6305
06:04:43,860 --> 06:04:45,440
I don't understand!

6306
06:04:54,960 --> 06:04:56,360
Yes!

6307
06:04:56,940 --> 06:04:57,640
I...

6308
06:04:57,640 --> 06:05:00,420
Okay.

6309
06:05:07,940 --> 06:05:09,340
I...

6310
06:05:09,800 --> 06:05:11,720
Time to act.

6311
06:05:11,900 --> 06:05:13,460
I don't understand.

6312
06:05:13,660 --> 06:05:14,360
I don't understand.

6313
06:05:17,800 --> 06:05:19,700
I don't understand.

6314
06:05:25,590 --> 06:05:27,710
I don't understand!

6315
06:05:28,370 --> 06:05:31,210
How do you dodge that move?!

6316
06:05:31,210 --> 06:05:33,090
I dashed through it!

6317
06:05:40,530 --> 06:05:43,090
Oh my god.

6318
06:05:44,690 --> 06:05:47,090
You just run?!

6319
06:05:52,240 --> 06:05:55,760
You need your ultimate, you just run away?!

6320
06:05:56,340 --> 06:05:57,200
Just...

6321
06:06:07,140 --> 06:06:09,260
Run or... okay.

6322
06:06:09,880 --> 06:06:12,040
This is before he does Musou.

6323
06:06:12,780 --> 06:06:13,100
Okay.

6324
06:06:15,100 --> 06:06:18,900
Save your Musou to fight his... Oh my god.

6325
06:06:19,000 --> 06:06:20,100
Oh my god.

6326
06:06:20,180 --> 06:06:21,150
I have to...

6327
06:06:21,680 --> 06:06:24,350
I worked so hard to...

6328
06:06:25,060 --> 06:06:27,100
Do we actually have to restart?!

6329
06:06:28,220 --> 06:06:30,420
Oh my god.

6330
06:06:30,960 --> 06:06:33,240
Oh my god.

6331
06:06:34,820 --> 06:06:36,440
Okay, I'll do one more attempt.

6332
06:06:36,600 --> 06:06:39,100
If we can't do it on this attempt, I'm...

6333
06:06:40,120 --> 06:06:44,740
I was so fucking... I played the fucking best out of my...

6334
06:06:44,740 --> 06:06:47,520
I actually played so well too.

6335
06:06:47,760 --> 06:06:48,940
That's the worst part.

6336
06:06:49,280 --> 06:06:50,120
I played so...

6337
06:06:50,640 --> 06:06:53,560
Like, I literally played like the best I've ever played.

6338
06:06:53,960 --> 06:06:55,320
And like...

6339
06:06:55,320 --> 06:06:58,360
I thought I just had to... Oh my god.

6340
06:06:58,940 --> 06:07:01,700
I played the best I could ever play there.

6341
06:07:02,020 --> 06:07:05,100
It was actually crazy how well...

6342
06:07:07,780 --> 06:07:08,420
Okay.

6343
06:07:09,400 --> 06:07:10,520
Oh shit, I forgot.

6344
06:07:10,800 --> 06:07:11,000
Whoops.

6345
06:07:12,240 --> 06:07:15,440
I forgot that he's already shield broken.

6346
06:07:15,640 --> 06:07:16,100
I'm so...

6347
06:07:16,640 --> 06:07:18,220
I've already lost my groove there.

6348
06:07:21,340 --> 06:07:22,480
It's too late.

6349
06:07:22,900 --> 06:07:23,740
Alright, we restart.

6350
06:07:25,340 --> 06:07:26,200
Let's restart.

6351
06:07:27,020 --> 06:07:27,880
Oh my god.

6352
06:07:28,160 --> 06:07:29,000
It doesn't matter.

6353
06:07:29,440 --> 06:07:30,340
It doesn't matter.

6354
06:07:47,450 --> 06:07:47,930
Okay.

6355
06:07:49,750 --> 06:07:50,230
Okay.

6356
06:07:50,230 --> 06:07:50,710
It's too late.

6357
06:07:50,890 --> 06:07:51,150
Alright.

6358
06:07:54,190 --> 06:07:55,090
I don't know.

6359
06:07:55,150 --> 06:07:57,810
I don't know where... Okay, when did I have Musou?

6360
06:07:58,450 --> 06:07:58,930
Okay.

6361
06:08:01,490 --> 06:08:03,150
Does it show when I have Musou?

6362
06:08:03,270 --> 06:08:03,930
Oh, I don't.

6363
06:08:03,990 --> 06:08:04,250
Okay.

6364
06:08:08,510 --> 06:08:08,990
Okay.

6365
06:08:09,910 --> 06:08:10,390
Alright.

6366
06:08:10,390 --> 06:08:12,050
Okay.

6367
06:08:12,050 --> 06:08:12,730
Oh my god.

6368
06:08:14,510 --> 06:08:16,550
Okay, we'll start here.

6369
06:08:16,970 --> 06:08:18,350
We'll start here.

6370
06:08:25,450 --> 06:08:26,750
We'll start here.

6371
06:08:29,530 --> 06:08:30,910
Oh my god.

6372
06:08:32,470 --> 06:08:33,130
I believe.

6373
06:08:36,250 --> 06:08:37,070
Jesus Christ.

6374
06:08:49,610 --> 06:08:50,170
Okay.

6375
06:09:03,910 --> 06:09:04,470
Guys.

6376
06:09:05,810 --> 06:09:08,850
I don't think I should have started from the beginning, guys.

6377
06:09:08,850 --> 06:09:12,590
Guys, I might have thrown by starting from the beginning.

6378
06:09:15,310 --> 06:09:15,870
I...

6379
06:09:23,410 --> 06:09:24,530
I forgot.

6380
06:09:25,390 --> 06:09:25,830
Okay.

6381
06:09:26,490 --> 06:09:28,370
I don't know how I got... Okay, guys.

6382
06:09:28,430 --> 06:09:30,830
Let's start from the beginning beginning.

6383
06:09:35,610 --> 06:09:36,170
Okay, guys.

6384
06:09:36,170 --> 06:09:36,170
Let's start from the beginning beginning.

6385
06:09:36,170 --> 06:09:37,110
The buttons are back?

6386
06:09:37,610 --> 06:09:38,010
Maybe.

6387
06:09:38,490 --> 06:09:39,070
Okay, guys.

6388
06:09:39,270 --> 06:09:41,290
Let's start from the beginning beginning.

6389
06:09:42,070 --> 06:09:46,770
I might have fucked up by saying let's start all the way back from the beginning.

6390
06:09:49,690 --> 06:09:51,810
Mistakes were actually made.

6391
06:09:53,910 --> 06:09:55,250
Oh my god.

6392
06:09:55,390 --> 06:09:57,610
Mistakes were actually made, guys.

6393
06:10:02,730 --> 06:10:04,750
I don't know how to build my Musou.

6394
06:10:04,870 --> 06:10:06,870
Okay, we gotta build Musou over here.

6395
06:10:07,170 --> 06:10:09,470
I'm gonna try and build my Musou from these guys.

6396
06:10:10,130 --> 06:10:12,970
If I can get to... If he can leave me alone.

6397
06:10:15,450 --> 06:10:18,770
I'll build Musou off the regular people real quick, guys.

6398
06:10:21,850 --> 06:10:22,830
Oh my god.

6399
06:10:26,430 --> 06:10:28,250
I'll let Nobu fight the others.

6400
06:10:28,930 --> 06:10:30,430
I need Musou.

6401
06:10:32,750 --> 06:10:34,870
Where are they?

6402
06:10:39,930 --> 06:10:41,570
Jesus Christ.

6403
06:10:45,330 --> 06:10:45,770
Okay.

6404
06:10:52,820 --> 06:10:54,040
Oh my god.

6405
06:11:07,350 --> 06:11:08,370
Oh my god.

6406
06:11:08,410 --> 06:11:09,090
Why me?

6407
06:11:09,910 --> 06:11:10,870
Why me?

6408
06:11:22,260 --> 06:11:23,540
I'm so mad.

6409
06:11:25,440 --> 06:11:26,780
I'm so mad.

6410
06:11:27,000 --> 06:11:28,180
Why is it always me?

6411
06:11:28,460 --> 06:11:30,500
Why is it... Okay, my one troop.

6412
06:11:58,580 --> 06:11:59,160
Okay.

6413
06:12:07,660 --> 06:12:09,520
Okay, I need... I need... I need bread.

6414
06:12:12,380 --> 06:12:13,640
Okay.

6415
06:12:14,940 --> 06:12:16,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

6416
06:12:27,600 --> 06:12:29,000
Okay.

6417
06:12:50,700 --> 06:12:54,680
Guys, I should not have started from the beginning.

6418
06:12:55,280 --> 06:12:58,920
I may have fucked up by starting from the beginning.

6419
06:13:04,500 --> 06:13:06,980
I definitely fucked up there.

6420
06:13:10,120 --> 06:13:13,800
I thought it was like, use boost, so I was like, okay.

6421
06:13:18,960 --> 06:13:19,660
No!

6422
06:13:24,810 --> 06:13:27,350
I was trying to die!

6423
06:13:37,750 --> 06:13:39,930
It was an accident.

6424
06:13:39,930 --> 06:13:42,870
I didn't want to use Musou.

6425
06:13:44,050 --> 06:13:46,590
I didn't want to use it.

6426
06:13:49,670 --> 06:13:51,230
Jesus Christ, we have to restart.

6427
06:13:52,670 --> 06:13:53,830
We gotta restart.

6428
06:13:56,590 --> 06:13:57,190
Unless...

6429
06:13:59,770 --> 06:14:00,370
Unless...

6430
06:14:00,370 --> 06:14:02,070
Oh, nope.

6431
06:14:03,070 --> 06:14:03,650
Did I block?

6432
06:14:03,790 --> 06:14:04,010
Nope.

6433
06:14:04,410 --> 06:14:05,890
Alright, get me out of here.

6434
06:14:06,530 --> 06:14:07,370
Get me out of here.

6435
06:14:08,130 --> 06:14:08,690
Oh.

6436
06:14:13,890 --> 06:14:17,310
Alright, how much was this part?

6437
06:14:17,950 --> 06:14:20,850
Alright, nope, we go back, we go further.

6438
06:14:22,850 --> 06:14:23,910
It softlocks.

6439
06:14:24,110 --> 06:14:27,030
It softlocks, oh my, every time!

6440
06:14:27,570 --> 06:14:31,230
It softlocks me in an area where he has like the red ability.

6441
06:14:31,450 --> 06:14:32,710
It's actually fucked up.

6442
06:14:33,070 --> 06:14:35,070
It's so fucked up!

6443
06:14:36,470 --> 06:14:37,350
How does it not?

6444
06:14:37,350 --> 06:14:48,510
When you're happy and he has the red abilities like oh my I hate that I hate that like every I'm backing further away.

6445
06:14:48,670 --> 06:14:50,230
I'm backing further away.

6446
06:14:50,330 --> 06:14:55,090
I can't I hate that it soft locks me to like where he has a power

6449
06:15:36,010 --> 06:15:37,430
Just- just end this.

6450
06:15:37,570 --> 06:15:37,910
End this.

6451
06:15:37,970 --> 06:15:38,590
Just end this.

6452
06:15:38,690 --> 06:15:39,250
Just end this.

6453
06:15:39,330 --> 06:15:39,930
Just end this.

6454
06:15:40,110 --> 06:15:40,890
Just end this.

6455
06:15:40,970 --> 06:15:41,550
Just end this.

6456
06:15:41,610 --> 06:15:42,390
This is not fair.

6457
06:15:42,710 --> 06:15:43,470
Just end this.

6458
06:15:46,250 --> 06:15:47,750
Just end this.

6459
06:15:50,730 --> 06:15:50,970
Okay.

6460
06:15:53,090 --> 06:15:53,970
There we go.

6461
06:16:00,690 --> 06:16:02,170
All right, I'm full focusing here.

6462
06:16:02,650 --> 06:16:03,390
Fucking hell.

6463
06:16:04,750 --> 06:16:05,510
Looking rough.

6464
06:16:07,810 --> 06:16:09,010
Oh,

6465
06:16:17,950 --> 06:16:18,730
fucking hell.

6466
06:16:24,270 --> 06:16:25,490
Jesus Christ.

6467
06:16:36,220 --> 06:16:38,360
That will have no effect on me.

6468
06:16:47,680 --> 06:16:50,640
Surely you are not spent yet.

6469
06:16:51,540 --> 06:16:53,240
Now it's my turn.

6470
06:16:54,960 --> 06:16:57,060
This just sucks.

6471
06:16:58,460 --> 06:17:00,360
I forgot to recharge my musou.

6472
06:17:01,800 --> 06:17:05,560
I need to- I need to kill people around me.

6473
06:17:05,620 --> 06:17:06,400
I forgot about that.

6474
06:17:11,060 --> 06:17:15,320
I forgot about like- the whole point was to get musou.

6475
06:17:41,320 --> 06:17:42,520
Jesus Christ!

6476
06:17:43,320 --> 06:17:45,540
I forgot how to dodge for a second there.

6477
06:18:00,960 --> 06:18:02,360
Fuck.

6478
06:18:06,540 --> 06:18:07,940
Okay.

6479
06:18:19,060 --> 06:18:19,460
Okay.

6480
06:18:37,200 --> 06:18:38,000
Jesus Christ!

6481
06:18:38,140 --> 06:18:40,020
Okay, I need to get- I actually need bread.

6482
06:18:45,280 --> 06:18:49,020
Okay, John Fei might die here though.

6483
06:18:49,660 --> 06:18:51,260
Okay.

6484
06:18:53,140 --> 06:18:54,540
Hmm.

6485
06:19:15,660 --> 06:19:16,360
Okay.

6486
06:19:26,240 --> 06:19:27,280
Whoa, whoa,

6487
06:19:31,740 --> 06:19:31,740
whoa.

6488
06:19:42,100 --> 06:19:42,820
Nice.

6489
06:19:48,860 --> 06:19:50,260
Jesus Christ.

6490
06:19:51,880 --> 06:19:53,420
I have the rage musou now.

6491
06:19:53,840 --> 06:19:56,440
I gotta make sure I use it for just that fight.

6492
06:19:57,640 --> 06:19:58,620
Jesus Christ.

6493
06:20:15,630 --> 06:20:16,350
Fuck.

6494
06:20:18,350 --> 06:20:21,410
We need a- this is my last buns.

6495
06:20:26,990 --> 06:20:29,090
Okay, my last two.

6496
06:20:41,800 --> 06:20:42,100
Okay.

6497
06:20:53,790 --> 06:20:54,810
That was an accident.

6498
06:20:54,870 --> 06:20:55,270
That was an accident.

6499
06:20:55,370 --> 06:20:56,030
I didn't mean to jump.

6500
06:21:10,590 --> 06:21:10,890
Okay.

6501
06:21:36,770 --> 06:21:39,790
Time to attack.

6502
06:21:39,790 --> 06:21:45,170
Take this!

6503
06:21:49,100 --> 06:21:50,760
I'll show you how much better I am.

6504
06:21:53,920 --> 06:21:55,260
Time to act.

6505
06:21:55,920 --> 06:21:56,800
I see it.

6506
06:22:02,820 --> 06:22:03,980
Jesus Christ.

6507
06:22:07,660 --> 06:22:08,700
Time to act.

6508
06:22:20,920 --> 06:22:22,280
Come on!

6509
06:22:34,210 --> 06:22:35,850
I'm so focused right now.

6510
06:22:36,770 --> 06:22:38,310
Oh my god!

6511
06:22:40,770 --> 06:22:41,810
Of course, of course.

6512
06:22:41,890 --> 06:22:42,590
I jinxed myself.

6513
06:22:42,750 --> 06:22:43,550
Of course, of course.

6514
06:22:44,470 --> 06:22:46,610
I jinxed myself the moment I say that.

6515
06:22:48,510 --> 06:22:49,150
No!

6516
06:22:54,530 --> 06:22:55,170
No!

6517
06:22:56,390 --> 06:22:59,490
Every time the horse fucks me over!

6518
06:23:04,030 --> 06:23:05,830
The horse actually fucks me over.

6519
06:23:05,910 --> 06:23:06,510
I'm so sad.

6520
06:23:11,990 --> 06:23:12,950
I need to unbind the horse.

6521
06:23:13,170 --> 06:23:14,770
It's actually throwing me off.

6522
06:23:16,270 --> 06:23:17,310
Oh my god.

6523
06:23:17,310 --> 06:23:17,870
Finish.

6524
06:23:34,390 --> 06:23:36,010
All right, I'm unbinding the horse.

6525
06:23:36,090 --> 06:23:36,930
I'm unbinding the horse.

6526
06:23:37,050 --> 06:23:37,670
I can't.

6527
06:23:37,950 --> 06:23:38,950
I actually can't.

6528
06:23:38,990 --> 06:23:39,690
Where's the horse?

6529
06:23:40,130 --> 06:23:41,550
Where the fuck is the horse?

6530
06:23:43,910 --> 06:23:45,150
Where is it?

6531
06:23:45,370 --> 06:23:47,850
Okay, get the rid of the horse.

6532
06:23:47,970 --> 06:23:48,850
Get rid of the horse.

6533
06:23:49,290 --> 06:23:50,250
Get unassigned.

6534
06:23:53,610 --> 06:23:55,410
Um, I don't fucking know.

6535
06:23:55,590 --> 06:23:55,830
Count.

6536
06:23:56,150 --> 06:23:57,130
Ah, fuck.

6537
06:23:57,210 --> 06:23:57,390
Okay.

6538
06:24:00,730 --> 06:24:03,290
What do I put the horse on?

6539
06:24:06,190 --> 06:24:06,730
Okay.

6540
06:24:12,410 --> 06:24:14,390
Here, give me that horse.

6541
06:24:14,690 --> 06:24:16,150
I don't fucking know.

6542
06:24:17,270 --> 06:24:19,250
Oh my god.

6543
06:24:21,370 --> 06:24:22,550
It won't.

6544
06:24:22,930 --> 06:24:24,070
Oh my god, it won't.

6545
06:24:25,820 --> 06:24:32,780
Oh my god, I can't.

6546
06:24:33,440 --> 06:24:34,700
I... oh my god.

6547
06:24:35,800 --> 06:24:39,260
Guys, I accidentally softlocked the horse.

6548
06:24:40,240 --> 06:24:41,600
I'm softlocked.

6549
06:24:43,980 --> 06:24:45,450
I'm softlocked.

6550
06:24:47,300 --> 06:24:51,100
It wouldn't let me... it wouldn't let me change.

6551
06:24:53,710 --> 06:24:55,330
It wouldn't let...

6552
06:24:57,230 --> 06:24:59,800
I can't change it.

6553
06:25:01,320 --> 06:25:02,720
Oh, I got stuck.

6554
06:25:03,460 --> 06:25:03,960
No!

6555
06:25:06,450 --> 06:25:07,380
Oh my god.

6556
06:25:07,680 --> 06:25:08,820
Oh, okay, it's enter.

6557
06:25:09,820 --> 06:25:10,100
Okay.

6558
06:25:14,880 --> 06:25:16,260
What does that mean?

6559
06:25:17,420 --> 06:25:18,660
What does that mean?

6560
06:25:18,800 --> 06:25:19,520
Get me out!

6561
06:25:22,340 --> 06:25:24,000
I'm pressing buttons.

6562
06:25:24,160 --> 06:25:25,780
It won't let me change.

6563
06:25:28,560 --> 06:25:29,240
Oh, okay.

6564
06:25:29,420 --> 06:25:29,700
Okay.

6565
06:25:30,140 --> 06:25:30,960
All right.

6566
06:25:32,900 --> 06:25:33,940
What was P?

6567
06:25:34,020 --> 06:25:34,640
I don't know.

6568
06:25:35,180 --> 06:25:35,560
Okay.

6569
06:25:38,460 --> 06:25:40,960
P. All right, I don't know where P was.

6570
06:25:41,600 --> 06:25:42,280
Okay.

6571
06:25:43,000 --> 06:25:44,020
I'll show you.

6572
06:25:44,440 --> 06:25:45,100
Okay.

6573
06:25:47,180 --> 06:25:49,380
I swear to fucking god.

6574
06:25:50,500 --> 06:25:52,020
It's not over yet.

6575
06:25:54,640 --> 06:25:55,800
Take a deep breath.

6576
06:25:56,380 --> 06:25:57,380
I'm taking a deep breath.

6577
06:25:57,700 --> 06:26:00,660
Oh my god, I fucking hate this.

6578
06:26:01,040 --> 06:26:01,820
I hate him.

6579
06:26:02,340 --> 06:26:04,300
I hate Lu Bu.

6580
06:26:05,320 --> 06:26:07,500
Why is he like this?

6581
06:26:08,620 --> 06:26:10,620
And I have to go through the arrows.

6582
06:26:10,840 --> 06:26:11,440
Okay.

6583
06:26:14,420 --> 06:26:17,980
Of course, I have to go through the stupid arrows.

6584
06:26:18,580 --> 06:26:22,920
The stupid fucking arrows of all things.

6585
06:26:23,480 --> 06:26:25,680
I always get locked in.

6586
06:26:28,220 --> 06:26:28,520
Okay.

6587
06:26:29,500 --> 06:26:30,060
Okay.

6588
06:26:38,460 --> 06:26:40,720
Okay, I fucked it up.

6589
06:26:41,120 --> 06:26:42,820
I already fucked it up.

6590
06:26:45,540 --> 06:26:48,360
Okay, I'm going in with less HP too.

6591
06:26:48,440 --> 06:26:49,400
That's the worst part.

6592
06:26:49,540 --> 06:26:50,720
I'm going in.

6593
06:26:51,960 --> 06:26:53,500
But at least I have my Musou.

6594
06:26:55,940 --> 06:26:57,740
I have my Musou though.

6595
06:27:00,540 --> 06:27:05,300
I have my Musou, but I'm going in with less HP.

6596
06:27:12,380 --> 06:27:14,740
Okay, nice.

6597
06:27:15,240 --> 06:27:16,780
Okay, I'm locking in.

6598
06:27:19,730 --> 06:27:20,270
Okay.

6599
06:27:29,850 --> 06:27:30,870
He's back!

6600
06:27:33,850 --> 06:27:35,830
I didn't even...

6601
06:27:39,830 --> 06:27:40,370
Okay.

6602
06:27:40,370 --> 06:27:41,310
Get him out.

6603
06:27:41,430 --> 06:27:41,950
Get him out.

6604
06:27:42,050 --> 06:27:43,450
Get this horse out of here.

6605
06:27:44,090 --> 06:27:46,250
Get him out of here.

6606
06:27:46,250 --> 06:27:48,150
Bind him somewhere else.

6607
06:27:48,350 --> 06:27:49,250
Bind him.

6608
06:27:50,670 --> 06:27:52,850
Bind him somewhere else.

6609
06:27:53,590 --> 06:27:54,330
I swear.

6610
06:27:54,550 --> 06:27:56,010
Give me something else.

6611
06:27:56,110 --> 06:27:57,690
I swear to god.

6612
06:28:00,890 --> 06:28:01,610
Here.

6613
06:28:01,790 --> 06:28:02,650
Okay, here we go.

6614
06:28:03,070 --> 06:28:03,630
Here we go.

6615
06:28:04,550 --> 06:28:05,130
There we go.

6616
06:28:11,360 --> 06:28:12,640
I'm... I can't.

6617
06:28:12,980 --> 06:28:13,680
Restart.

6618
06:28:13,780 --> 06:28:14,200
Restart.

6619
06:28:15,120 --> 06:28:17,500
Oh, restart.

6620
06:28:18,420 --> 06:28:19,740
Alright, locked in.

6621
06:28:23,400 --> 06:28:23,880
Okay.

6622
06:28:33,840 --> 06:28:34,980
The horse did everything.

6623
06:28:35,460 --> 06:28:36,740
The horse ruined everything.

6624
06:28:40,260 --> 06:28:40,740
Okay.

6625
06:28:47,080 --> 06:28:47,520
Whoa.

6626
06:29:13,820 --> 06:29:14,260
What?

6627
06:29:18,160 --> 06:29:18,940
Okay, fine.

6628
06:29:19,600 --> 06:29:19,840
Fine.

6629
06:29:19,920 --> 06:29:20,060
Fine.

6630
06:29:20,120 --> 06:29:20,320
Fine.

6631
06:29:20,600 --> 06:29:20,920
Fine.

6632
06:29:21,000 --> 06:29:21,240
Fine.

6633
06:29:21,280 --> 06:29:21,480
Fine.

6634
06:29:21,560 --> 06:29:21,860
Fine.

6635
06:29:21,860 --> 06:29:22,080
Fine.

6636
06:29:22,240 --> 06:29:22,360
Fine.

6637
06:29:22,440 --> 06:29:22,740
Fine.

6638
06:29:22,740 --> 06:29:22,920
Fine.

6639
06:29:23,100 --> 06:29:23,100
Fine.

6640
06:29:23,500 --> 06:29:23,580
Fine.

6641
06:29:23,640 --> 06:29:23,880
Fine.

6642
06:29:24,460 --> 06:29:24,900
Fine.

6643
06:29:25,120 --> 06:29:25,300
Fine.

6644
06:29:26,000 --> 06:29:26,440
Fine.

6645
06:29:26,540 --> 06:29:26,540
Fine.

6646
06:29:26,580 --> 06:29:26,600
Fine.

6647
06:29:26,600 --> 06:29:26,600
Fine.

6648
06:29:26,600 --> 06:29:27,020
That's fine.

6649
06:29:28,200 --> 06:29:28,480
Fine.

6650
06:29:28,520 --> 06:29:29,080
That's fine.

6651
06:29:30,100 --> 06:29:30,800
Okay.

6652
06:29:35,460 --> 06:29:36,780
Fine, that's fine.

6653
06:29:52,920 --> 06:29:55,400
Oh my god.

6654
06:29:57,580 --> 06:29:59,640
Oh my god.

6655
06:30:16,940 --> 06:30:24,300
Oh my god.

6656
06:30:30,940 --> 06:30:32,340
Oh my god.

6657
06:30:37,400 --> 06:30:38,460
No!

6658
06:30:39,500 --> 06:30:41,600
I timed it wrong!

6659
06:30:42,940 --> 06:30:45,900
All of this has to do with timing!

6660
06:30:47,800 --> 06:30:48,040
Yeah.

6661
06:30:58,480 --> 06:30:59,540
Yeah.

6662
06:31:24,080 --> 06:31:26,760
Just have to get him over to the safe.

6663
06:31:38,380 --> 06:31:41,600
He put me in that fucking hole!

6664
06:31:42,280 --> 06:31:44,500
Oh my god, you fucker!

6665
06:31:51,000 --> 06:31:51,700
I hate him.

6666
06:31:51,800 --> 06:31:52,120
I hate him.

6667
06:31:52,300 --> 06:31:53,160
I hate him.

6668
06:31:53,940 --> 06:31:54,800
I hate him.

6669
06:31:54,820 --> 06:31:55,380
I hate him.

6670
06:31:55,440 --> 06:31:56,960
I hate him so much!

6671
06:31:57,800 --> 06:31:58,360
Bitch.

6672
06:32:31,780 --> 06:32:32,480
Yeah.

6673
06:32:38,910 --> 06:32:39,610
Okay.

6674
06:32:57,690 --> 06:32:59,090
Fine.

6675
06:33:05,650 --> 06:33:07,050
Yeah.

6676
06:33:08,630 --> 06:33:09,330
Yeah.

6677
06:33:22,870 --> 06:33:23,710
How boring.

6678
06:33:33,410 --> 06:33:34,010
Fine.

6679
06:33:42,910 --> 06:33:43,390
No.

6680
06:33:43,990 --> 06:33:45,870
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6681
06:33:47,670 --> 06:33:48,610
No!

6682
06:33:58,980 --> 06:34:00,180
No.

6683
06:34:06,480 --> 06:34:07,680
No.

6684
06:34:13,330 --> 06:34:14,910
What's that?

6685
06:34:26,890 --> 06:34:28,290
No!

6686
06:34:40,110 --> 06:34:41,290
No!

6687
06:34:42,650 --> 06:34:43,490
Yes!

6688
06:34:44,450 --> 06:34:45,290
Yes!

6689
06:34:45,710 --> 06:34:46,150
Please!

6690
06:35:04,530 --> 06:35:08,030
Oh my god.

6691
06:35:16,720 --> 06:35:20,660
Oh my god.

6692
06:35:21,020 --> 06:35:21,660
No!

6693
06:35:22,060 --> 06:35:26,140
Get him out of the lobby!

6694
06:35:26,840 --> 06:35:29,140
Get him out of my fucking...

6695
06:35:29,860 --> 06:35:31,800
After three years!

6696
06:35:32,700 --> 06:35:36,680
Oh my god, after fucking three years.

6697
06:35:37,960 --> 06:35:39,660
Oh my god.

6698
06:35:45,000 --> 06:35:46,620
Oh my god.

6699
06:35:47,120 --> 06:35:48,120
Why are they here?

6700
06:35:48,200 --> 06:35:48,860
They did nothing!

6701
06:35:49,460 --> 06:35:52,260
They died when he was like, barely hurt!

6702
06:35:56,660 --> 06:35:58,200
What did they do?

6703
06:35:58,460 --> 06:35:59,940
What did these guys do?

6704
06:36:00,380 --> 06:36:01,800
They did nothing!

6705
06:36:04,240 --> 06:36:06,600
I can't believe they took my credit!

6706
06:36:15,020 --> 06:36:16,540
I'm so tired.

6707
06:36:18,300 --> 06:36:21,200
This cutscene is so cool, but I'm so tired.

6708
06:36:22,160 --> 06:36:23,160
Thank you.

6709
06:36:23,160 --> 06:36:28,100
Oh my god.

6710
06:36:34,700 --> 06:36:36,380
Where am

6711
06:36:41,680 --> 06:36:42,820
I in this cutscene?

6712
06:36:43,420 --> 06:36:44,520
Where am I?

6713
06:36:45,140 --> 06:36:48,460
After every scene!

6714
06:36:57,180 --> 06:36:59,440
What do you mean I'm not there?

6715
06:36:59,880 --> 06:37:01,440
I did so much!

6716
06:37:01,840 --> 06:37:02,940
Where am I?

6717
06:37:03,820 --> 06:37:06,100
I just want to be in the cutscene!

6718
06:37:06,860 --> 06:37:09,260
I don't even get the bare minimum!

6719
06:37:16,880 --> 06:37:19,820
I'm so sad, I'm so sad.

6720
06:37:31,280 --> 06:37:32,980
This is robbery.

6721
06:37:32,980 --> 06:37:36,960
This is robbery, what the fuck did Olufe do?

6722
06:37:41,760 --> 06:37:44,540
Can I at least get some validations and chat?

6723
06:37:44,660 --> 06:37:46,660
You guys know I was part of it, right?

6724
06:37:47,260 --> 06:37:49,180
You guys know I did all the...

6725
06:37:49,180 --> 06:37:52,720
You guys saw it, right?

6726
06:37:53,400 --> 06:37:55,780
You guys saw me do everything, right?

6727
06:38:03,700 --> 06:38:06,100
I was so close!

6728
06:38:24,950 --> 06:38:28,330
I don't even get like...

6729
06:38:29,110 --> 06:38:35,150
I don't even get like one visual in there.

6730
06:38:36,130 --> 06:38:40,150
They actually erased me from the cutscene.

6731
06:38:40,670 --> 06:38:42,770
And so fucked up.

6732
06:38:43,930 --> 06:38:47,510
George, I got zero screen time.

6733
06:38:47,650 --> 06:38:49,430
I've been fighting Lu Bu.

6734
06:38:49,690 --> 06:38:52,570
I was so close to crashing out, guys.

6735
06:38:52,670 --> 06:38:53,330
You don't understand.

6736
06:38:54,390 --> 06:38:55,810
That was such a...

6737
06:38:55,810 --> 06:38:57,210
Okay, confession.

6738
06:38:57,510 --> 06:39:00,250
After Dynasty Warriors, I was going to play Elder Ring.

6739
06:39:00,790 --> 06:39:06,690
But like, after that fight, I'm playing something more chill after Dynasty Warriors.

6740
06:39:06,770 --> 06:39:07,930
I can't, guys.

6741
06:39:08,630 --> 06:39:09,530
I'm there.

6742
06:39:12,770 --> 06:39:15,410
I'm not doing Elder Ring right after Dynasty Warriors.

6743
06:39:15,930 --> 06:39:16,490
That...

6744
06:39:16,490 --> 06:39:18,970
Oh, I can't do that again right now.

6745
06:39:19,030 --> 06:39:19,690
I need to rest.

6746
06:39:22,150 --> 06:39:23,630
Oh my god.

6747
06:39:24,150 --> 06:39:27,310
That Lu Bu fight was fucking crazy.

6748
06:39:30,570 --> 06:39:32,790
I hate Lu Bu now.

6749
06:39:33,230 --> 06:39:34,990
Thank you for the super chat, Alan.

6750
06:39:35,150 --> 06:39:36,270
Thank you, thank you.

6751
06:39:36,610 --> 06:39:38,330
T-Pose, thank you for the super chat.

6752
06:39:38,450 --> 06:39:39,250
Thank you, thank you.

6753
06:39:39,350 --> 06:39:41,550
And no one remembered us.

6754
06:39:41,550 --> 06:39:43,390
Thank you for the super chat.

6755
06:39:43,530 --> 06:39:44,770
Thank you, thank you.

6756
06:39:44,910 --> 06:39:46,750
This is all Lu Bu's fault.

6757
06:39:47,190 --> 06:39:49,330
This is all Lu Bu's fault.

6758
06:39:49,750 --> 06:39:51,930
Estero, thank you for the super chat.

6759
06:39:52,070 --> 06:39:53,370
Thank you, thank you.

6760
06:39:55,870 --> 06:39:57,550
I'm so sick, girl.

6761
06:40:00,570 --> 06:40:02,110
Punchtop, thank you for the super chat.

6762
06:40:02,190 --> 06:40:03,010
Thank you, thank you.

6763
06:40:03,150 --> 06:40:04,030
Congrats, Doki.

6764
06:40:04,210 --> 06:40:06,790
You have chained Lu Bu up and brought him to his knee.

6765
06:40:06,870 --> 06:40:09,990
And now he knows what to do for you since you conquered him.

6766
06:40:09,990 --> 06:40:12,470
Thank you for the super chat.

6767
06:40:12,590 --> 06:40:13,710
Thank you, thank you.

6768
06:40:14,130 --> 06:40:17,290
Why was that fuck so hard?

6769
06:40:18,150 --> 06:40:19,870
Oh my god.

6770
06:40:20,950 --> 06:40:23,690
Oh my fucking god.

6771
06:40:26,190 --> 06:40:27,830
Oh my god.

6772
06:40:30,770 --> 06:40:33,070
Lu Bu perished in Xiapi.

6773
06:40:33,490 --> 06:40:35,850
Cao Cao returned to the city of Xu.

6774
06:40:36,950 --> 06:40:39,230
Accompanied by Lu Bei.

6775
06:40:43,980 --> 06:40:46,900
For impregnating you after the general host bar.

6776
06:40:47,420 --> 06:40:49,860
Bro, they just rewrote me out of history.

6777
06:40:51,500 --> 06:40:54,000
I don't even know how long I fought him.

6778
06:40:54,000 --> 06:40:54,480
What?

6779
06:41:03,900 --> 06:41:04,860
Well,

6780
06:41:11,020 --> 06:41:13,380
there I am.

6781
06:41:13,820 --> 06:41:15,220
I finally made my appearance.

6782
06:41:24,000 --> 06:41:24,500
There you are.

6783
06:41:25,640 --> 06:41:26,440
Lord Xu Huang.

6784
06:41:27,820 --> 06:41:29,860
I had heard that you would serve Lord Cao Cao.

6785
06:41:30,240 --> 06:41:31,580
So I came to give you my greetings.

6786
06:41:32,600 --> 06:41:34,000
I don't play Dynasty Warriors.

6787
06:41:34,180 --> 06:41:37,500
I was not expecting fucking a swords game.

6788
06:41:41,300 --> 06:41:44,660
You were in a situation similar to my own, were you not?

6789
06:41:45,320 --> 06:41:46,200
Lord Xu Huang.

6790
06:41:46,760 --> 06:41:51,060
If I may ask, how do you serve two lords without any qualms?

6791
06:41:52,060 --> 06:41:54,040
Saying I have no qualms would be a lie.

6792
06:41:54,040 --> 06:41:57,580
But so would denying my wish to pursue my path as a warrior.

6793
06:41:58,840 --> 06:42:02,020
Even as an enemy, I was astounded by how you fought in Xiapi.

6794
06:42:02,580 --> 06:42:05,040
Fighting beside you would truly be a blessing.

6795
06:42:07,080 --> 06:42:11,000
I can only hope that I may follow in your footsteps as a great warrior.

6796
06:42:12,140 --> 06:42:12,740
Lord Guan Yu.

6797
06:42:13,200 --> 06:42:13,920
Lord Zhen Liao.

6798
06:42:14,400 --> 06:42:15,860
I ask you both for your guidance.

6799
06:42:16,680 --> 06:42:19,820
So you would follow me just as I followed Lord Lu Yi Bu?

6800
06:42:19,820 --> 06:42:24,620
I'm not like... I'm not like registering anything in this conversation right now.

6801
06:42:24,700 --> 06:42:27,740
I'm like disassociating from that Lu Yi Bu fight.

6802
06:42:28,360 --> 06:42:31,480
I'm so disassociated right now.

6803
06:42:32,240 --> 06:42:39,020
That fucking fight was actually... I actually had to start parrying.

6804
06:42:39,600 --> 06:42:43,420
I had to fucking parry to fucking beat him.

6805
06:42:43,420 --> 06:42:48,080
Like... even when I fought against... what was it?

6806
06:42:48,180 --> 06:42:49,140
The orphan guy?

6807
06:42:49,460 --> 06:42:50,960
The orphan guy in Bloodborne?

6808
06:42:51,120 --> 06:42:55,080
I didn't even learn to parry in Bloodborne to kill Orphan of Cause.

6809
06:42:55,300 --> 06:42:58,940
I had to learn to parry to fucking kill Lu Bu.

6810
06:42:59,300 --> 06:43:01,460
That's like how fucked up it was.

6811
06:43:01,760 --> 06:43:04,900
I actually had to learn how to parry to fight Lu Bu.

6812
06:43:05,320 --> 06:43:08,880
Like I got away with zero parries on Orphan of Cause.

6813
06:43:08,880 --> 06:43:11,620
If you look around...

6814
06:43:11,620 --> 06:43:18,160
If you look around, you can see a bot of me killing Orphan of Cause with zero parries.

6815
06:43:18,600 --> 06:43:23,720
And then I had to learn how to parry in this game.

6816
06:43:24,360 --> 06:43:25,780
Oh my god.

6817
06:43:31,800 --> 06:43:36,420
If I didn't have to fight Lu Bu, I could go for like two to three hours.

6818
06:43:36,680 --> 06:43:38,360
That took up the rest of my day.

6819
06:43:38,360 --> 06:43:39,700
I'm done.

6820
06:43:44,460 --> 06:43:45,420
I can't.

6821
06:43:45,780 --> 06:43:48,100
That is where I'm gonna call for today.

6822
06:43:52,020 --> 06:43:52,700
Call me.

6823
06:43:52,860 --> 06:43:53,880
Thank you for the super chat.

6824
06:43:54,020 --> 06:43:54,380
Thank you.

6825
06:43:54,420 --> 06:43:54,840
Thank you.

6826
06:43:54,960 --> 06:43:56,780
Was it worth the... I don't know.

6827
06:43:57,480 --> 06:43:59,520
I just hope there's no one that's stronger.

6828
06:43:59,580 --> 06:44:01,900
There's no way there's anyone that's harder than this.

6829
06:44:01,980 --> 06:44:03,480
There's no fucking way.

6830
06:44:03,720 --> 06:44:07,320
I refuse to believe there's a harder boss fight than this.

6831
06:44:07,320 --> 06:44:09,200
That was actually painful.

6832
06:44:09,480 --> 06:44:13,720
I barely did any damage too.

6833
06:44:14,200 --> 06:44:15,420
That's the worst part.

6834
06:44:15,580 --> 06:44:17,920
I was doing little fucking dots.

6835
06:44:18,060 --> 06:44:21,520
At least in Orphan of Cause, I was doing a lot of damage per swing.

6836
06:44:21,760 --> 06:44:24,580
I was doing fucking toothpick damage on him.

6837
06:44:25,040 --> 06:44:27,280
I swear to god.

6838
06:44:30,960 --> 06:44:32,440
The dragon's treasure.

6839
06:44:32,680 --> 06:44:33,700
Thank you for the super chat.

6840
06:44:33,900 --> 06:44:34,360
Thank you.

6841
06:44:34,360 --> 06:44:34,800
Thank you.

6842
06:44:34,800 --> 06:44:41,740
To get red hair, you need to defeat Lu Bu using no items, no buttons at the highest tip.

6843
06:44:42,260 --> 06:44:44,700
Bro, I gotta just eat the horse.

6844
06:44:44,940 --> 06:44:48,800
Let the fucking horse die.

6845
06:44:49,260 --> 06:44:51,020
I don't need the red hair.

6846
06:44:51,180 --> 06:44:54,020
I don't fucking... I'm not doing that.

6847
06:44:55,040 --> 06:44:57,520
It took me six hours.

6848
06:44:58,120 --> 06:44:59,260
Thank you for the super chat.

6849
06:44:59,380 --> 06:44:59,760
Thank you.

6850
06:44:59,860 --> 06:45:00,480
Thank you.

6851
06:45:01,040 --> 06:45:04,620
Guys, can I get some validation in chat?

6852
06:45:04,620 --> 06:45:09,000
At least have you guys remembered me killing Lu Bu?

6853
06:45:10,180 --> 06:45:12,300
Guys, you guys were all there, right?

6854
06:45:12,480 --> 06:45:14,860
You guys saw me kill Lu Bu, right?

6855
06:45:15,620 --> 06:45:18,640
Can I have some validation?

6856
06:45:22,580 --> 06:45:24,520
Oh my god.

6857
06:45:25,180 --> 06:45:27,100
I was so angry.

6858
06:45:27,360 --> 06:45:32,020
I was so angry during that fight.

6859
06:45:32,020 --> 06:45:34,680
It was so bullshit.

6860
06:45:35,540 --> 06:45:38,340
The worst part is that he kept...

6861
06:45:38,340 --> 06:45:43,260
He kept, like, soft... He was trying to soft lock me too.

6862
06:45:43,620 --> 06:45:45,540
I think that was the worst part.

6863
06:45:45,920 --> 06:45:50,040
When, like, every time I restart, I get soft locked into a red attack.

6864
06:45:50,220 --> 06:45:51,860
Like, it doesn't matter where.

6865
06:45:52,240 --> 06:45:53,700
It didn't matter where.

6866
06:45:53,860 --> 06:45:55,360
That fight was so bullshit.

6867
06:45:57,460 --> 06:46:01,140
I do have no heals on the last checkpoint too.

6868
06:46:02,920 --> 06:46:05,500
Have you ever heard of one guy from Shen Yang?

6869
06:46:05,760 --> 06:46:06,540
Thank you for the super chat.

6870
06:46:06,640 --> 06:46:07,340
Thank you.

6871
06:46:07,360 --> 06:46:07,920
Thank you.

6872
06:46:08,100 --> 06:46:10,040
Lord Kuro says thank you for the super chat.

6873
06:46:10,140 --> 06:46:10,460
Thank you.

6874
06:46:10,480 --> 06:46:11,000
Thank you.

6875
06:46:11,080 --> 06:46:13,540
Lu Bu was defeated by Doki Hu.

6876
06:46:18,460 --> 06:46:19,900
Oh my god.

6877
06:46:21,220 --> 06:46:22,720
NotSoDeadPool, thank you for the super chat.

6878
06:46:22,840 --> 06:46:23,160
Thank you.

6879
06:46:23,220 --> 06:46:23,620
Thank you.

6880
06:46:23,680 --> 06:46:25,120
Lu Hu, I didn't see anything.

6881
06:46:25,240 --> 06:46:26,880
Can you try again?

6882
06:46:28,100 --> 06:46:29,560
Thank you for the super chat.

6883
06:46:29,720 --> 06:46:30,140
Thank you.

6884
06:46:30,340 --> 06:46:30,960
Thank you.

6885
06:46:32,280 --> 06:46:33,860
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

6886
06:46:33,980 --> 06:46:34,220
Thank you.

6887
06:46:34,320 --> 06:46:34,820
Thank you.

6888
06:46:35,300 --> 06:46:39,240
Ever have a Chinese warlord hold you down with his bare hands?

6889
06:46:39,600 --> 06:46:41,380
Oh my god.

6890
06:46:41,480 --> 06:46:42,820
When he come at the horse.

6891
06:46:43,200 --> 06:46:44,440
The fucking horse.

6892
06:46:44,940 --> 06:46:48,660
I swear to god, I kept getting fucked over by the horse.

6893
06:46:48,840 --> 06:46:51,560
Let me fix my horse real quick.

6894
06:46:54,120 --> 06:46:55,220
Actually, you know what?

6895
06:46:55,260 --> 06:46:56,260
I'm gonna put it on here.

6896
06:46:56,580 --> 06:46:59,340
I think it actually is better if I put it over there.

6897
06:47:00,240 --> 06:47:00,760
Alright.

6898
06:47:02,020 --> 06:47:03,700
JR, thank you for the super chat.

6899
06:47:03,780 --> 06:47:04,120
Thank you.

6900
06:47:04,180 --> 06:47:04,880
Thank you.

6901
06:47:05,240 --> 06:47:06,800
I'm gonna call it here, guys.

6902
06:47:06,860 --> 06:47:08,020
I'm exhausted.

6903
06:47:08,300 --> 06:47:13,440
I hope you guys had a fun time watching me crash out on Lu Bu.

6904
06:47:14,180 --> 06:47:17,000
Oh my god, I'm so over this guy.

6905
06:47:17,120 --> 06:47:19,140
Okay, I'm gonna go rest now.

6906
06:47:19,460 --> 06:47:20,920
It was a long stream.

6907
06:47:21,260 --> 06:47:24,400
I played Dynasty Warriors for almost 7 hours.

6908
06:47:24,840 --> 06:47:26,520
It was 7 hours of hell.

6909
06:47:26,520 --> 06:47:27,180
Well, no.

6910
06:47:27,560 --> 06:47:32,520
It was like 5 hours of joy and then 2 hours of hell.

6911
06:47:33,300 --> 06:47:34,180
The laugh.

6912
06:47:34,520 --> 06:47:36,760
2 hours of absolute hell.

6913
06:47:37,780 --> 06:47:40,480
I was stuck in the cage with Lu Bu.

6914
06:47:43,560 --> 06:47:45,480
Anyways, I'm gonna call it here.

6915
06:47:45,720 --> 06:47:47,760
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

6916
06:47:48,140 --> 06:47:48,820
Posture check.

6917
06:47:49,140 --> 06:47:51,200
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6918
06:47:51,320 --> 06:47:53,120
If you stay up for me, head to bed.

6919
06:47:53,220 --> 06:47:54,520
Cause you deserve it.

6920
06:47:54,520 --> 06:47:56,540
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6921
06:47:57,100 --> 06:47:58,020
Bye, guys.

6922
06:47:58,280 --> 06:47:58,800
Bye!
