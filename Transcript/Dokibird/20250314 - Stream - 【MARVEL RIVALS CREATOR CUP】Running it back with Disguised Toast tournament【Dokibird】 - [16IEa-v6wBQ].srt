Good morning.

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,840
There's only one real time zone true

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,240
Wow Oh my god

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:14,420
I got quiet while we all in here for Because I don't know But I guess We're waiting still for Kyle.

52
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,440
They're dialing in.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,560
They're trying way too hard right now.

54
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,580
Booger, you can just go in there and yell at them.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,640
Why don't you just go guide them?

56
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,760
Guys, I am very tired.

57
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,380
We should all just join their...

58
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,740
Guys, I think going to bed at 4 in the morning was not a great idea.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,840
What if we join and say our favorite Ultimate voice line?

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,900
My pick.

61
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,260
Can we drag them?

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,540
Born again!

63
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,240
Again!

64
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,740
Born again!

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,920
Again!

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,140
While we wait, can Dana give us some LeBron James motivational quotes?

67
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,700
You guys listen to the A.I.

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,100
song?

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,420
The A.I.

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,760
song?

71
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm going to put it in general.

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,620
Okay.

73
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,540
It's not an A.I., but it's just a LeBron song.

74
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,240
R&B.

75
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,940
Oh, I thought it was a LeBron James song.

76
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,680
Hang on, they're here.

77
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,320
They're here.

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,720
Alright, everyone.

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,700
Thank you all so much for...

80
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,000
Guys, I'm just waking up, guys.

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
...joining today's tournament.

82
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,940
It's a very simple format.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,740
It's a seven-team round, Robin.

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,540
You just play every team once, so everyone's guaranteed seven games.

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,660
Top two teams just does a BO3 at the very end.

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,140
You guys are playing for a prize pool of $60,000.

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,840
Wow!

88
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,880
By participating, each team already earns $6,000.

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,200
So, just before showing up, each of you walks away with $1,000.

90
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,000
Congratulations!

91
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,140
Yippee!

92
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,020
Woohoo!

93
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,820
$1,000.

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,500
Thank you so much, sponsors.

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,180
A big thank you to Mr. John Marvel Rivals.

96
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,200
Captains, you guys should know who's hosting each lobby.

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,140
It's always going to be Team A.

98
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,340
Try to have each other added.

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640
We're going to go pretty quickly.

100
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,720
I know how annoying it is to have downtime between games in these tournaments.

101
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,960
So, pretty much whenever you're done, you can hop into your next one.

102
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
Any questions?

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,280
No.

104
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,180
No.

105
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,460
What happened to our free skins from the Clone Royale?

106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,260
Thank you.

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
The clone mode is down until tomorrow.

108
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,780
So, what happened to the skins?

109
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,960
What happened to the skins?

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
What did you do with the money then, bro?

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
I mean, it's codes.

112
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
It's not actual money.

113
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,660
Wait, can we have the codes now?

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,540
So, can everyone get codes now?

115
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,900
For the codes?

116
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,300
Toast, you can kick them from the tournament.

117
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,220
We'll figure that out later.

118
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,380
Everyone, you guys are all free to join your lobby whenever.

119
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,380
And with the remaining 10 seconds, I would like all of you to trash talk someone specific.

120
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,960
I don't even have to say their name when they are in my fucking brain.

121
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,360
You are so fucking fast.

122
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,800
I was in your brain without saying a word, bitch.

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm just going to leave.

124
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,820
I don't even want to hear you talking anymore.

125
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,100
Alright, good luck, everyone.

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,720
I joined first, so no one had to hear it.

127
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,160
That's right.

128
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right.

129
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm a good man.

130
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,780
And now it's time to lock-flank Jeff.

131
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,740
I need Luna buff.

132
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,180
Let's go.

133
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,360
You're just going to get fucking slam dunked by Booger.

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,780
No, I'm not.

135
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,260
Alright, okay, fine.

136
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,420
Lock in Jeff.

137
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,660
Let's see how it goes.

138
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,300
I don't even need to use my ult.

139
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,840
I just have to Icicle their backline.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,300
No, believe in him.

141
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,480
We got a Jeff!

142
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,920
I'm literally playing Mystery Heroes this tournament.

143
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Oh, by the way, I know I'm tank, but Adams might be my second best character.

144
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,440
If we ever need an Adam.

145
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, if we do triple support, then we'll just go Adam.

146
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,140
Another triple support tournament.

147
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,680
Oh boy, this is not your favorite, Coney.

148
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,000
We ran 3-3 all fucking day.

149
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,780
I'll do another 3-3 again.

150
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,160
I'll brush up on the stream.

151
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,360
The thing is, if I'm on support and none of you are getting healed, I'm going to use the backline.

152
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah, because why don't you just stay defense?

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,980
We run triple support with surefour on Jeff.

154
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,860
With surefour on Jeff and then the tank line.

155
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,040
We have to protect the thing because Coney loves the thing.

156
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,760
And he's a little... he needs the thing to function.

157
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,560
So, I don't know for the backline.

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,600
I mean, we could ban Mag if we want to.

159
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,340
Or Hulk.

160
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,240
We're banning Hulk, right?

161
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,860
For a bulger.

162
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,380
Yeah, I'm down.

163
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,520
I play Strange and Mag mostly, but I've learned the root of it.

164
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,700
I mean, we could do... do we do a Mag thing or a Strange thing?

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,220
Either one is alright.

166
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,100
Oh, so what is... Tuanto?

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,420
Is that how you pronounce your name?

168
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,500
Yeah.

169
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,700
Or you can just call me Jake.

170
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,940
Or Jake, okay.

171
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,720
Yeah, that is a lie.

172
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,160
I don't know if we should say who Jake plays.

173
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
We've got too many viewers here right now.

174
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,940
Yeah, what do you play, Jake?

175
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,120
But like, he cooks.

176
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,160
I play DPS.

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,500
What is a Bobo?

178
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,320
I play mostly all the hitscan ones.

179
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,920
Just because I'm just naming.

180
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,080
Yeah, just play your best DPS character, really, because it's a Creator Cup, not like a fucking actual esports tournament.

181
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,360
Unless Bogred tries really, really hard.

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,900
I mean, we all just play our best character, and then Surefour can play Mr. Heroes.

183
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,500
It's crazy that we play every team one time.

184
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,140
Yeah, I mean, there's seven teams.

185
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
I'm not doing best of three from seven different teams.

186
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,780
True.

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,920
That's way too much.

188
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,640
We can't adapt.

189
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,760
Also, Surefour, can you make the lobby for the next team?

190
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,280
Because I don't know how to make lobbies.

191
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,200
No.

192
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,980
What the fuck do you mean, no?

193
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:02,800
No.

194
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,500
Okay, well, who knows how to make...

195
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,040
I will not take this delegation.

196
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,100
This is your captain speaking, and I'm delegating my work to you.

197
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm a loose cannon.

198
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,840
You're a loose cannon?

199
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,040
Okay, well, does anyone else want to make the lobby?

200
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,600
Because it's a little too much responsibility for me.

201
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,340
I can, but I don't really know how.

202
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,820
Okay, I believe in you.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,680
You can do it.

204
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,020
I can try.

205
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,360
Okay, are we all ready?

206
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,540
Yeah, I think we're ready now.

207
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,960
What's our second ban, by the way?

208
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,780
Is there anything we really want to ban for a second ban?

209
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,500
I like don't know who they play, but I don't think they know who I play.

210
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,000
I mean, I'll just ban Bucky, because Bucky is so overpowered, then.

211
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,660
Yeah, I also kind of hate Wolverine, but I don't know if we play him.

212
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:04,420
I don't think anyone on the enemy team has a good enough Wolverine, but like, obviously, it's like the most normal ban.

213
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,380
I'm not worried about it.

214
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm on thing.

215
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,500
Yeah, I'm not worried about it either, and I feel like banning Bucky is like the scariest DPS at the moment.

216
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,800
Yeah, I'm down.

217
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,140
You also don't want me on Bucky.

218
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,220
I'll fucking throw the game.

219
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,160
Who has the ban?

220
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,160
Who has the ban thing?

221
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,380
It's Glorpfan.

222
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,140
Wait, why is it me?

223
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,920
It's, um...

224
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,760
It's whoever has... Are you in a faction?

225
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,200
If you are, then it usually goes to you.

226
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,720
Oh, yeah, I am.

227
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,960
Yeah, so it goes to you.

228
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,180
So we're banning Hulk first.

229
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,520
Yeah, I'm down.

230
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,870
And then protect the thing.

231
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,490
Protect the thing.

232
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,950
Oh, nice, he did.

233
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,430
Okay, we ban Namor then.

234
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,010
Okay, protect thing?

235
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,490
Protect the thing, yeah.

236
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,610
I just hate playing against Namor.

237
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,230
Why can't they click on him?

238
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,790
Oh, wait in front of me.

239
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,190
Yeah.

240
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,710
Wait, they're going Dive.

241
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,790
Oh, okay, we keep Namor.

242
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,730
We keep Namor.

243
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,190
Protect the thing.

244
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,930
Protect the thing.

245
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,430
Okay, okay, okay.

246
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,930
And then, well, if they're going Dive, we fucking ban Spider.

247
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,790
Spider-Man or Magic, I don't know if they play Spider or Magic, but we could just ban Spider.

248
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,970
Yeah, we could ban Spider.

249
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,630
Yeah.

250
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,770
Just ban Spider.

251
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,470
We ban Spider and then we have Namor against Dive.

252
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,530
So ban Spider.

253
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,630
Yeah, I almost thought I was done banning for a second.

254
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,830
And then if they ban Namor, then, like, I fucking...

255
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,050
I don't know what we could do against Dive.

256
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,150
Good luck, everybody.

257
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,930
We all fucking try to survive.

258
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,950
Alright, we still have Namor.

259
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,310
We still have Namor.

260
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,880
If they do have Dive, you know how to play Invis?

261
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:07,720
Lulu?

262
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,700
Yeah, I can do Invis.

263
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,760
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you can just Invis and just Invis push the Venom away.

264
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,800
But Cloak is alright.

265
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,700
I think, like, I think Invis is better than Cloak for ult-wise, though.

266
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,200
I think Invis is broken.

267
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,280
Alright, let's go!

268
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,440
I just need to wake up.

269
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,820
Where's your caffeine?

270
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,480
I didn't have time to make caffeine.

271
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,880
Where's your alarm on your phone?

272
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
What do you mean my alarm woke me up at 11.45?

273
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,260
Why'd you put it at 11.45?

274
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,520
I was really looking forward to the clone rumble.

275
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,100
I know!

276
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,820
We get free skins!

277
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,580
Now Toast is gonna pocket it.

278
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,660
The rich get richer.

279
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,980
Did you get your skin money for the V2 movement?

280
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,440
I have no idea what I'm gonna do with that.

281
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,980
They apparently are supposed to email you that.

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,600
That's strange.

283
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,780
I got it.

284
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,840
Oh, you got it?

285
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,780
There's so much.

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,140
Oh my god.

287
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,280
Oh, maybe I'll just check my spam.

288
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,200
Okay.

289
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,120
They have Namor.

290
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,900
Oh my god, I definitely wake.

291
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,500
I've frozen.

292
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,760
There's a Hawkeye on our left.

293
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,840
Wait, any heals?

294
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,240
We can?

295
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Thank you.

296
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,340
I'm gonna heal behind you too.

297
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,440
Okay, I got you.

298
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm trying to get Namor here.

299
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,920
Get the turrets, get the turrets.

300
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,080
I got him.

301
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,380
Just push out if you can.

302
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:42,860
Yay!

303
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,140
It's just Venom.

304
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,360
They're opening a portal.

305
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,360
The chip is 3-0?

306
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,700
It works!

307
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,220
It works!

308
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I got you.

309
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,700
Thank you, thank you.

310
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,660
I need help, I need help.

311
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,480
I've frozen.

312
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,980
I've frozen, I've frozen, I've frozen.

313
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,040
Venom has no...

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,700
Oh no, our chip!

315
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,460
Is it a good ult?

316
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,340
I can't tell.

317
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,340
You ult first, Lulu.

318
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,060
Oh, I'm dead.

319
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,140
Should I go ahead and use it?

320
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,480
Yeah, you can use it.

321
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,300
I'll do it for Strange.

322
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I'm on Venom.

323
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,940
I froze Venom.

324
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,420
I think we gotta reset.

325
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,080
Let's reset.

326
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm resetting this.

327
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,700
Yeah, one sec, I had nobody to jump to.

328
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,480
They have Strange ult and they should have Venom ult.

329
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,960
Can we...

330
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,460
Push Strange ult?

331
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,220
And this?

332
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,520
Yeah, I'll save it.

333
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,440
Or like, Luna freeze.

334
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,220
No, no, they have Strange ult.

335
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
Luna ult is best against Strange ult.

336
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,320
Yeah.

337
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,260
Alright.

338
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,260
No more on the left, he's like flanking in the building.

339
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,340
Frozen.

340
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
Venom's still on the back here.

341
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,740
Yeah, they have Wraith behind us.

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
They have Nocturne behind us.

343
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,380
I'm just... Oh, I couldn't do anything.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
I got one of their supports.

345
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,420
We have a Namor behind us.

346
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,900
So we can't do anything.

347
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,900
Do you have portal?

348
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,740
We could just portal, backline.

349
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,360
You wanna go?

350
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,340
Yeah, portal, backline, maybe.

351
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,620
Oh, not there, not there, not there!

352
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,020
I'm covering him, I'm covering him, I'm covering.

353
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,040
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

354
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,320
They have nothing to drop though.

355
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,780
He's long.

356
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,780
He's got nobody.

357
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,720
Get the Luna, get the Luna!

358
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm damage boosting it.

359
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
Spit me out now!

360
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
I spit you out, I spit you out.

361
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,440
He's flipping out of here.

362
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,340
Trade the turrets again.

363
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm trying to help you.

364
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,780
Thank you.

365
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,080
Venom, Venom 1, Venom 1, Venom 1!

366
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,940
Strange, strange, nice.

367
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,100
They're gonna have portal, so...

368
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,160
No, they're waiting, they're waiting.

369
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,200
Alright, go Sherford, go!

370
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,660
I'm going, I'm going.

371
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,800
Go Sherford, go!

372
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,840
I'm going, I'm going.

373
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,160
I see the smallest shark fin through the wall.

374
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,160
It's so funny.

375
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,040
It's adorable.

376
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:41,920
Nice.

377
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,440
They have a low key.

378
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,380
They have a low key, yeah.

379
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,180
Mag now.

380
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,260
What if I just give my snowflake to our shark?

381
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,840
I'll call strange.

382
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,600
In a strange mirror?

383
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,760
Come on, man.

384
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,320
Venom in the back, he's about to die.

385
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,540
Venom, Venom, Venom 1, we can burn Venom.

386
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,220
No, nevermind.

387
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,400
Yeah, Neymar's up top.

388
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,660
Coney, Coney, you're by yourself, careful.

389
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,940
I got it.

390
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,200
There's still Neymar above us.

391
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,360
Yeah, sorry.

392
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,060
No, I had a good lineup, but it's only because everybody else was there.

393
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,140
Yeah, yeah, we were being terrorized.

394
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,980
All good, all good.

395
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,580
Where's our shark?

396
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,860
Can we walk up?

397
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:27,860
Yeah.

398
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm low.

399
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,300
There is a Neymar behind us.

400
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,060
There is a Neymar behind us and Venom.

401
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,300
Nice, here we go, here we go.

402
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
I might need to go Mag here.

403
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,860
Damage.

404
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,280
Yeah, I pushed out way too far on that.

405
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
I have my ult too.

406
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,580
I almost had my ult.

407
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,360
Oh my gosh, shit.

408
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,080
We have to get this Neymar off of high ground.

409
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,780
Trevor, can you get that Neymar off of high ground?

410
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,540
Mmm.

411
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,760
Oh wait, you're a Neymar.

412
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,160
Oh nevermind, I thought you were a shark still.

413
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,440
Nah.

414
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,580
I got one up there, I can't get it.

415
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,420
I froze him again.

416
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,040
We're still here.

417
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,060
Do you want to...

418
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,200
Invis first if you have to.

419
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,120
Okay.

420
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,880
Oh my gosh.

421
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,080
I don't think our heal is gonna heal us right now.

422
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,600
Yeah.

423
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,780
I might need heals here.

424
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,080
Can you look at me?

425
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,680
Thank you.

426
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm gonna go ahead and use mine here.

427
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,960
Okay.

428
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh nice, they didn't get it correctly.

429
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,700
I got their Luna.

430
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,760
We need both, we need both!

431
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,220
Neymar dead.

432
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,160
Okay, I'm damage boosting.

433
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,840
Focus on Mag, he's on the cart.

434
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,740
Yeah, I'm looking at Mag.

435
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,100
We can't progress without him.

436
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,120
Okay, nice.

437
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
We have no support else here.

438
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,720
Okay.

439
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,480
Wait, Surefour, where are you?

440
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,700
I can give you an orb.

441
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm right here.

442
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,460
I got ult, I might just push up and force it.

443
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,440
Just to get that wall down.

444
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,000
I can portal this door, but...

445
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,320
I mean, you have to portal it now.

446
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,120
We can.

447
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,800
Nevermind, you can't, you can't, you can't.

448
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,160
I froze him.

449
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,440
Nice.

450
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,080
I got their Neymar.

451
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:14,940
I'm dropping.

452
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,980
Last fight.

453
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,760
I froze him, I froze him.

454
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,520
Oh, I got shot.

455
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,080
You only have two heals.

456
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,100
Make sure you're on the cart too.

457
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:37,740
Yeah.

458
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,780
I'm at 10%.

459
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,820
The Neymar is up top, trying to get me.

460
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,220
No heals yet, no heals yet, I'm coming over now.

461
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,780
I'm dead.

462
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,220
Not the squid.

463
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,680
I know, it's the squid.

464
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,760
Okay, we always ban Neymar.

465
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,880
I cannot heal a fucking Neymar.

466
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,720
No, he is.

467
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,320
Decent push.

468
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,200
Not a bad push.

469
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,420
Yeah, Neymar is just flanking.

470
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,680
I can just give Surefour the snowflake to contest the Neymar.

471
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,020
Wait,

472
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,340
can we Neymar or no?

473
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,440
Surefour can play Neymar.

474
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,600
I need like...

475
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,040
Caffeine in my nose.

476
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,960
It's okay, my eyes are...

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,300
Snort G-Fuel.

478
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,440
Dust your eyeballs a little bit.

479
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,960
Dust my eyeballs.

480
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,700
Quickest path to your brain.

481
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,720
Oh shit.

482
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,100
It's the first game.

483
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Only thing, let's calm if we are distracted.

484
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,640
Unless I'm trying to figure out if there is shit on you guys.

485
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,660
Yeah, I always freeze a Venom.

486
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,600
So unless I freeze a Venom, we can just turn around and kill him.

487
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,640
I'll go Mag if we lose first.

488
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,940
I think Neymar is like being very obnoxious.

489
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,280
Yeah, I think Mag is the better tank with the thing.

490
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,580
That was comedy.

491
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,080
I got you.

492
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,780
He missed the dive.

493
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,220
Oh, he shielded it.

494
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,620
Venom on, Venom on, Venom on.

495
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,720
Behind us Neymar, behind us Neymar, behind us Neymar.

496
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,680
I need heals.

497
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,080
Venom is coming up.

498
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,700
Venom diving.

499
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,860
Frozen Venom, frozen Venom, frozen.

500
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,980
Oh, we have to get out of this Neymar.

501
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,540
I think I got locked.

502
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,880
Jesus Christ.

503
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,040
I wasn't even close.

504
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,500
Fuck man, my bad.

505
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
We need someone to turn around for that Neymar.

506
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,200
I can portal us here.

507
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah, portal us.

508
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,040
I got their Venom.

509
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,940
Yeah, we are portaling, we are portaling.

510
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't know if Venom is going to come and drop.

511
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,540
We'll body block.

512
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,280
I killed Venom.

513
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,360
Someone touch point, someone touch point.

514
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,660
I got it.

515
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,520
It's fine, it's fine, we got the touch point.

516
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,580
Neymar, Neymar, Neymar on point, Neymar on point.

517
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,420
Probably a reset.

518
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm still there.

519
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,800
I'm getting... no way.

520
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:05,940
Melted.

521
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I think, I don't know which...

522
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,820
I think like...

523
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,980
Jake, you might have to contest the Neymar.

524
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,260
If you can.

525
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,100
Because he's always going to be flanking since that's what Neymar players do.

526
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,200
Mhmm.

527
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,840
So we need at least one person.

528
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,320
Venom is on me in the back.

529
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,290
Alright, I can't push up.

530
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,470
So they give you Snowflake.

531
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,470
Your powers are mine!

532
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,370
Got bubbled.

533
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,750
We have to push up soon.

534
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,200
Thank you.

535
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,520
Alright, I have to pop this to push up.

536
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,620
We gotta push up here with it.

537
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,540
Yep.

538
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm on my way back.

539
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,120
Venom's still back here.

540
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,780
I'm fine.

541
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,620
Holy shit.

542
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,320
Boggers on me!

543
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:15,920
Boggers on me!

544
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,650
I don't have freeze because of him.

545
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,630
I got two.

546
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,930
Boggers still...

547
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,710
Boggers is on our backline right now.

548
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,230
Venom's on our backline too.

549
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,770
I'm 10% to my ult.

550
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,330
I'm trying to survive as long as I can here.

551
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,350
Wait, Coney's coming in.

552
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,430
Just touch one hand.

553
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,410
I'm just trying to hold Coney as long as I can.

554
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,790
Alright, at least we know.

555
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,030
We bad name Roy.

556
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,370
Honestly?

557
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,590
GG, nice try.

558
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,250
It's just the first game.

559
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,990
It's the first game of the day.

560
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,130
Yeah, I'm not even awake.

561
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,130
Okay, I know he's a better player than me, but I get to say that I made Boggers switch off Strange in the mirror.

562
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,010
He did.

563
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,810
He had to go mag.

564
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,670
That's cringe meta.

565
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,350
All good.

566
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,570
DM for Glorp.

567
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,890
We just couldn't handle flankers.

568
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,010
I think next ban, we just ban Namor because he's just a good flanker character.

569
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,410
Yeah.

570
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,710
What's their comp if they have other flankers?

571
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,650
Oh, they have other flankers.

572
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,310
Namor is supposed to deal with flankers.

573
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,210
Or he flanks himself.

574
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:46,990
It really depends on who has the... which Namor flanks first basically.

575
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,150
I was getting picks on their Luna.

576
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:58,430
He was doing the same thing to his team, but the enemy team also had a Venom to help with the flanker as well, but we only have frontline.

577
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,630
So I think Coney just has to turn around and protect the backline.

578
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,230
Coney or Jake has to deal with the flanker.

579
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,550
You have to just 1v1.

580
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,790
Wait, do I have to make a lobby now?

581
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,470
Yeah, you make the lobby for the next one.

582
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,750
DM for Glorp.

583
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,370
Depends if their game is done or not.

584
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:27,470
Yeah, but we have to make the lobby first anyway, so... Why don't we just stay in this lobby and then just switch?

585
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,370
Oh, that's true.

586
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,690
We can steal their lobby.

587
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,810
Or wait, but Bogren might stay in his lobby though.

588
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,850
No, they already all left.

589
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,330
Oh, they all left?

590
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,990
Alright, we kidnapped this lobby.

591
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,730
My lobby now!

592
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,050
Can you re-invite me?

593
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:42,950
I left the lobby.

594
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,690
Yeah, I got you.

595
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,290
Who am I fighting next?

596
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,370
I don't even know.

597
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,410
Oh, Mendo's team.

598
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,650
We're fighting Mendo's team next.

599
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,670
I think... I think we're done?

600
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,050
I think?

601
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,330
We'll see.

602
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,330
They're not... It doesn't say in-game so that's not... Oh yeah, they got rolled apparently.

603
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,570
Oh, nice.

604
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,490
Okay, let's... By Timmy's stack team.

605
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,290
Oh yeah, Timmy's team is pretty stacked, yeah.

606
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,190
Oh yeah, they're here.

607
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,950
I don't even know who we're playing against.

608
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,590
Mendo's team, which would be...

609
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,370
Fuck, what is it?

610
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,190
XQC, Taxi, JDOTB, Pico, Buddha.

611
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,730
What's the map?

612
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,510
Wait, who has... Am I the one that has access to... Oh, I do.

613
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,570
What is the map?

614
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,050
I don't even know what the map is.

615
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,430
Hell's Heaven, okay.

616
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,170
Guys, I don't know how to do this.

617
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,270
Oh, there it is.

618
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,740
Where the fuck is Hell's Heaven?

619
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,240
Am I stupid?

620
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,400
Where is it?

621
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,860
Oh, there it is.

622
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,660
Hell's Heaven.

623
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,540
Are y'all alright?

624
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,260
Um, we ban Groot.

625
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,940
We have... I'm down.

626
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,240
Yeah, my Groot's pretty good.

627
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,100
Well, I don't know if I want to call a tank.

628
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,140
No, XQC is a Groot one trick.

629
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,040
We ban Groot.

630
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,320
Unless Shortfur wants to play Wolverine against his Groot.

631
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,580
Probably not.

632
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,240
Alright, then we do Groot name war.

633
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,960
We might go Rocket Punisher, but that's alright.

634
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,140
I think we'll be okay, question mark.

635
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,770
We know you are Truss.

636
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,250
Your team's not even that stacked.

637
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:04,890
What's happening?

638
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,650
It's okay, I have a back brain debuff.

639
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,290
He's just saying, implying our team is really stacked.

640
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,390
Well, I'm like...

641
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,870
What do you mean?

642
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,890
I'm literally just waking up.

643
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,990
We have two Genshin players and a Smash player.

644
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,530
I don't know, I think also because he has a thing against Code right now.

645
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,410
I haven't played Smash in five years, bro.

646
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,630
I'm a YouTube watcher.

647
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,450
I play Smash.

648
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,610
Oh yeah, you're the Smash player.

649
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,270
Genshin is like aim.

650
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,370
It's like riding a bike.

651
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,090
That's crazy.

652
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,590
Oh no, they aren't ready yet.

653
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,070
I think they're also not happy of getting enrolled by Timmy's team.

654
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,490
We gotta lock in.

655
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,910
Oh my god.

656
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:08,450
Honestly, also, if they have Dive and Coney can Magneto, I could add him and then we do a solo tank Mag.

657
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,490
I don't think this team's gonna play Dive.

658
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,350
Yeah, no, this team's not.

659
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,690
I'm also down to just hug backline more.

660
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,570
I was in frontline mode.

661
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,830
Yeah, Coney, yeah.

662
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,130
When they have Dive, just jump back to us if you can or do Mag Strange.

663
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,130
Sure.

664
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,740
We know you are.

665
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,340
Like, what?

666
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,860
You know, XQ2's always mad.

667
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,440
I know.

668
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,600
It's just silly.

669
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,740
Alright, we do...

670
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,220
Who has it?

671
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,400
Okay, Glorpfan.

672
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,600
You ban Groot.

673
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,560
But they're banning first.

674
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,840
Ban Groot, protect the thing.

675
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,220
Do you think they ban Thing?

676
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,500
Oh, well, Coney...

677
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
Coney likes the thing.

678
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,400
Magneto.

679
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,120
They might, okay, they might be doing infinite ammo punisher.

680
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,240
They might be doing infinite ammo punisher then if they ban Magneto.

681
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,720
Yeah, they could be.

682
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,420
We could ban Rocket.

683
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,160
Or Bucky.

684
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,200
Wait, what do you want to protect?

685
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,460
Thing?

686
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,640
I like Thing Mag and if Mag's dead, I'll feel...

687
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah, no, no, sure.

688
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,940
I mean, I like Strange Mag.

689
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,320
Protect, yeah, yeah.

690
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,480
Should we...

691
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
Do you want... Should we ban Rocket or Namor then?

692
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,340
Woah.

693
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,720
That's you guys.

694
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,780
Because if you do a Punisher infinite, that's like... that's also like not fun to play against.

695
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,420
We only have one ban.

696
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
I leave it up to you.

697
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
Alright, okay.

698
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,750
Ban... Ban...

699
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay, it's either Rocket or Namor.

700
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,020
Do you guys think we can deal with another Namor player?

701
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,040
Does he play Namor?

702
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,600
Does he play Namor?

703
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,220
Namor is easy to play.

704
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,800
Like anybody can play Namor.

705
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,660
But Rocket we can get rid of the infinite.

706
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
So we just do Rocket then.

707
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,460
Ban Rocket?

708
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:03,860
Yeah.

709
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,420
Rocket makes Punisher and Bucky like not the best characters.

710
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,360
Because if they're banning Mag we don't have a shield.

711
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,100
Oh, I've... Oh, yeah.

712
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,980
Um, well you can play Cloaker too.

713
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,140
Whichever one you feel more comfortable with.

714
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,740
If you feel more comfortable with Cloaker we can deal with it.

715
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:24,820
Yeah.

716
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,860
Don't tell other teams, but like this guy is lowkey like a Widow one trick.

717
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,840
Yo, chill.

718
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,600
That's what my friend told me.

719
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,340
Yo, chill!

720
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,640
That's what my friend told me.

721
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,080
I was like, I wonder who they're gonna get on our team to replace me next week.

722
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,960
And then my friend was like, Oh, they got this guy.

723
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,820
He's a Widow one trick.

724
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,900
Oh, no.

725
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,180
Oh, that's good.

726
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,100
Yo, get that LF Hella, bro!

727
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,100
Nah, Hella's just so much damage.

728
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,120
Lock the Mantis.

729
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Get the Widow.

730
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,240
Get some headshots.

731
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,940
Wait, in soloQ I TP to their high ground here.

732
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,560
Is that like throw?

733
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,560
No, it's not.

734
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,640
It's still pretty okay.

735
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,060
I think it's better to save TP mostly.

736
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,460
Yeah, like usually, yeah, it's just like a back and forth.

737
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,960
Okay, we're going Widow.

738
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,520
We need a Mantis so...

739
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,800
I'll get August.

740
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,260
I'll get August.

741
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,920
I think we need the team up.

742
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,600
That's what we need.

743
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,240
Get on Hawkeye.

744
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,580
Get the fuck off of there.

745
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,800
It's okay.

746
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,500
No matter what we at least still get a thousand dollars.

747
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,700
A thousand dollars!

748
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,000
And a video probably.

749
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,440
True.

750
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,080
A video?

751
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,520
Unless you go like 0-7.

752
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,360
I was gonna say 0-7.

753
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:37,940
I don't know.

754
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,900
Wait, what if he goes...

755
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,440
Alright, let's go point.

756
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,280
Come right side.

757
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,840
Careful.

758
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,160
I messed up my dash.

759
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,160
Yeah, I was gonna say careful.

760
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,740
They're behind.

761
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,380
He's behind.

762
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:54,940
I froze him.

763
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,340
I froze him.

764
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,920
I froze him behind.

765
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,060
He's one.

766
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,580
There you go.

767
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,860
We can push up with that.

768
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,080
I got it.

769
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,500
Don't worry.

770
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:03,920
Can't finish it.

771
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,640
I'm back.

772
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,120
Help Coney.

773
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,880
Find the Bucky!

774
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,800
His name is Robbie Dean!

775
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,140
I'm dying.

776
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:11,960
I'm healed.

777
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,600
Coney has to stay on point again.

778
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,040
Yeah, I'm staying on.

779
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,620
Have to reload.

780
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,980
Oh my god, I got...

781
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,940
Bucky, very low.

782
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,920
Oh, low.

783
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,980
Yeah, he's in that thing.

784
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,400
Alright, let's group up here.

785
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,240
Coming back.

786
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,920
I got you.

787
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,580
That looks annoying.

788
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh.

789
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,580
Back up if you can.

790
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,460
Yeah, just back up.

791
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,620
Reset fully.

792
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,720
Yep, I got it.

793
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,160
Alright.

794
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,970
We gotta wait for...

795
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,330
Wait for sure for...

796
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,610
I'm back.

797
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,970
Alright, let's go.

798
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,550
Oh wait, you're fucking Bucky.

799
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,630
I don't know why.

800
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,610
Flankers are not good.

801
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,150
I'm locked in.

802
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,410
Wide among us.

803
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,490
You wanna do cloak first?

804
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,270
Yeah, cloak first.

805
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,570
I only do...

806
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,430
I'm like one.

807
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,210
I froze, huh?

808
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,790
Got a bunch.

809
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,270
Yeah, it's in their ult, though.

810
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,350
Yeah, it's in their ult.

811
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,710
You're right.

812
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,310
I'm ulting.

813
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,650
I have to ult this.

814
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,350
Oh, hello.

815
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,930
Oh wait, look, look, Bucky!

816
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,510
Oh no!

817
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,170
Goodbye, Sherwood!

818
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,450
No, I'm good.

819
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,510
They have strange ult.

820
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,770
Careful of strange ult.

821
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,570
I missed the froze.

822
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,070
No.

823
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,970
I think at this point, we have to go triple support.

824
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,890
Yeah, we could.

825
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,410
Or Hulk.

826
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,070
I don't think we should play Hulk.

827
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,450
But if we do triple support, we can't run the thing.

828
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,110
Okay.

829
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,230
I'll just go to mag.

830
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,790
Not yet, not yet.

831
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,150
We're poiling.

832
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,110
I'm stuck behind, though.

833
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,110
You have to jump on.

834
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,650
No, no, we have time.

835
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,810
It's alright.

836
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,230
High ground.

837
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,890
He's blocking us.

838
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,190
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

839
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,350
Can we shoot this guy?

840
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,030
There's a Hulk behind us.

841
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,890
I need heals if you can.

842
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,590
Hulk is still weak.

843
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,630
It's fine, we got it.

844
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,290
We're fine, we're fine.

845
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:46,910
Thank you.

846
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,210
I'm grabbing the low key.

847
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,650
Where the fuck are they?

848
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:51,990
Yeah.

849
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,990
You're not going to fall for that, Taxi.

850
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,010
We can push up a bit, no?

851
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,130
Yeah, we can.

852
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,090
They have...

853
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,850
Do you want to cloak first?

854
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,150
Always cloak first.

855
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,830
I'm always going to try and get the strange doll if I can.

856
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,950
Just Luna, relax.

857
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,990
Right here, right here.

858
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,630
They're going to have...

859
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,370
Yeah, they do, they do.

860
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,710
So we try and cloak that.

861
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,350
Oh no.

862
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,650
I'm dead.

863
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,290
Yeah, we have to use that.

864
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,550
I'm getting Hulk-culted.

865
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,090
Oh, what's happening?

866
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,510
Hulk on?

867
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,850
Oh, I got fucking pushed out of it.

868
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,810
Woah, woah, woah.

869
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,790
I got pushed out of it, yo.

870
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,350
We might have to run triple support, I think.

871
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,790
Yeah, it was a big ult, but...

872
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,370
This is untouchable.

873
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,750
Next point.

874
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,510
Okay, wait, who do you want solo tank?

875
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,230
We need either... we need mag.

876
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,030
Solo tank is always mag.

877
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,090
Oh, mag's bad?

878
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,410
Oh shit, alright, then we can just run strange.

879
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,310
That's all we could do.

880
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,310
Or triple support, or do...

881
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,050
Well, if you want a strange, Coney, I can add him.

882
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,290
Um, okay, I can try it.

883
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,890
Strange isn't great.

884
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:31,730
I mean, I'm okay with it, but if we need to run a triple support, and you gotta go add him, that's fine.

885
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,670
I'll go it.

886
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,170
It's just not as good as mag, so...

887
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,070
Your guy's called, though.

888
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,310
I think we... the thing is, like, uh...

889
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,450
When, uh...

890
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,710
When we have strange, you just get...

891
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,590
Either you play a little passive on strange, because you get deleted so fast.

892
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,810
Because you're frontlining way too hard.

893
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,650
That's fine, I'll hold it back.

894
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,410
Yeah, and it, um...

895
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,770
Because, like, Lulu and I can't heal the strange player.

896
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,370
Since you get deleted way too fast for us.

897
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,490
I'm just gonna play... I'm gonna put the orb on surefire.

898
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,170
We might switch to Thor.

899
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:14,810
We'll see.

900
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,050
Or we nunge the three.

901
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,290
Three's always works.

902
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,130
Loki's top left.

903
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:18,630
Real Loki.

904
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,410
It's fine.

905
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,650
I can ult this if you want.

906
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,930
I'm ulting.

907
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,770
I'm just blocking it.

908
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,030
I'm blocking it.

909
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,630
Walk forward.

910
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,150
Walk forward.

911
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,530
Walk forward.

912
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,600
There's a hell of a minus.

913
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,060
I forced ult.

914
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:35,940
I'm still bonded.

915
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,600
Nice.

916
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,660
Oh, wow.

917
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,380
We died to that.

918
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,360
That Agamotto...

919
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,480
Oh, yeah.

920
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,660
No, it's Agamotto, yeah.

921
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,500
Probably just gonna rip my ult next fight.

922
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,800
Yeah, I'm getting mine, too.

923
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,840
I portal.

924
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:57,700
Yeah.

925
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,360
We could try it.

926
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,160
Okay.

927
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,580
Alright, I'm gonna portal high ground.

928
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,640
One second.

929
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,800
Oh, I was gonna say.

930
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,460
Alright, going real high on this one.

931
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:16,920
Okay.

932
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,260
Nice kill.

933
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,920
Loki down.

934
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,220
They're all low up here.

935
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,260
What the hell?

936
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,980
You can drop down while they're down at support.

937
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,740
Alright, I'm dropping down.

938
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,440
Go.

939
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm gonna ult Loki here.

940
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,700
Got it.

941
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,260
Nice.

942
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:32,800
Again.

943
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,640
Hulk can die.

944
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,260
Hulk can die.

945
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,780
Get the...

946
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,680
Hulk?

947
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,060
Anybody?

948
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,080
No, we have to try and get a reset for it.

949
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,060
Oh, hello one.

950
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,500
Hello one.

951
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:41,880
Hello one.

952
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:44,980
Nice.

953
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,420
Again.

954
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,460
Again.

955
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,680
Again.

956
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,060
Again.

957
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,800
Again.

958
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm gonna reposition here so I can have ult.

959
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,460
Yeah, they're gonna have Hulk ult and also...

960
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,140
A squirrel here.

961
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,760
Loki on the right.

962
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,580
He's looking for it to dive at support.

963
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,340
He's diving at support.

964
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,480
Why don't you guys stay on point?

965
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm staying on the point.

966
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,180
My ult's down.

967
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,660
My ult's down.

968
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,160
Oh, I'm getting smashed.

969
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,360
Yes, you are.

970
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,820
I can't rez here.

971
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,160
There's a strange pushing behind.

972
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,460
Oh, you can rez?

973
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,060
That's unfortunate.

974
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,840
This map's hard.

975
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,240
They fucking can walk into us.

976
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,360
Yeah.

977
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,320
I can rez.

978
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,580
No, no rez.

979
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:39,960
Don't rez.

980
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,260
Don't rez.

981
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,420
We can't.

982
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,880
Don't waste it.

983
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,260
Just come back.

984
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,700
I have eye up.

985
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,560
Let's just wait for everybody.

986
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,320
I have ult for the strange ult.

987
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,420
Yeah, let's come before we ult because if you ult and I soulbond, we're just wasting one.

988
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,100
Just let me know before.

989
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,020
It's better if you save the soulbond for your defensive.

990
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,180
Are you ready to go?

991
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,840
I'm pushing up.

992
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,900
Yeah, I'm ready.

993
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,300
There's a Hulk behind us.

994
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,160
It's fine.

995
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,440
It's fine.

996
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,840
I'm gonna jump off the ult backline.

997
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,660
Hulk's on me in the back.

998
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,200
They're gonna... Adam, you have to hide.

999
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,840
You have to hide.

1000
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,740
He's got a strange ult.

1001
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,700
I can't keep you up.

1002
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,140
That's good.

1003
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,280
Nice.

1004
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:27,780
Nice.

1005
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,120
Okay.

1006
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,040
I just tried to get the backline.

1007
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:31,660
Here we go.

1008
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,900
I have to touch point.

1009
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,740
I have to touch point.

1010
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,660
I'm gonna die first then.

1011
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,240
I got a support.

1012
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,140
Nice.

1013
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,620
Hulk low.

1014
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,060
Hulk's one.

1015
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,340
Oh, we're just off.

1016
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,280
I don't know.

1017
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,180
Warm up.

1018
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,700
Warm up.

1019
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,300
Are you using finer rolls or the team comp?

1020
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,280
I mean like the easiest one.

1021
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,200
The best comp is 3-3.

1022
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,980
Wait, 3-3?

1023
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,460
3-3 goats, 3 tanks, 3 supports because that's what pro play is playing right now.

1024
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,780
And it's the easiest comp to play.

1025
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,460
I mean, I'm done.

1026
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,620
Unless like we could... I don't know.

1027
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,700
Shurpa, what do you think?

1028
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,560
At this point, it just has to be everyone playing in their most comfortable way.

1029
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,040
Yeah, I think.

1030
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,100
I was thinking that.

1031
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,700
Everyone just plays whatever they're comfortable with.

1032
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,740
Shit.

1033
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,240
Just play your best character.

1034
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,100
Block the Mantis Widow, fuck it.

1035
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,900
Yeah, let's just do it.

1036
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,860
I'll do Mantis Widow.

1037
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
And we need to do triple support though.

1038
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,220
We're doing Mantis Widow.

1039
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,120
But someone has to go Luna.

1040
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,120
Someone has to go Luna or we ban Luna so we have main heals.

1041
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,600
I can do Luna.

1042
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,840
Yeah, we need Luna and then...

1043
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,760
And then either Adam or Cloak or Sue.

1044
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,920
I think... Yeah, I'm down.

1045
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:19,220
I can say... Any time... Okay, we need to... The only thing I need help with is calm what we're looking at.

1046
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:26,120
Because sometimes I notice when Hulk's on you guys, I'm trying to fight their other tank and then you guys aren't looking at me and I'm not looking at you.

1047
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,140
So we're just doing different shit and then nothing does.

1048
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,800
So I need to... I mean, that's probably on me but let's just try.

1049
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,980
Yeah, we can calm it louder because usually I freeze the Hulk or I just say Hulk's frozen or Hulk's down.

1050
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,800
I think I should just turn around and help you guys there because there's...

1051
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,140
If you guys are ever distracted...

1052
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,080
You don't turn around.

1053
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,440
If you're playing... Wait, who's talking?

1054
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:48,640
Sorry.

1055
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,460
I'm strange.

1056
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,120
You don't turn around.

1057
00:45:52,260 --> 00:46:01,380
You just back up because the other tank... You're the main frontline tank and you're just supposed to back up but the other tank is supposed to turn around.

1058
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:09,020
Or one of the DPS turns around because we can't lose our frontline.

1059
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,940
Yeah, and I got you.

1060
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,140
Who's our next round?

1061
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,160
Our next round is... Are we making it?

1062
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,980
Oh, we keep the lobby.

1063
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,160
We're just gonna keep stealing the lobby.

1064
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,400
I cannot be bothered.

1065
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,180
Um... Timmy has not added me yet.

1066
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,220
Oh, I meant the view career.

1067
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,100
Let me see.

1068
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,200
Who's on Timmy's team?

1069
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,900
Maybe I have someone on Timmy's team.

1070
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,520
I like how they say Timmy's team but they're captains more.

1071
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,140
Wait, Kony, you left.

1072
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,960
Kony, we're stealing the lobby.

1073
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,040
We have the same lobby.

1074
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,860
We're just gonna keep using the lobby.

1075
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,200
Yeah, my bad.

1076
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,960
Yeah, honestly, I think we need... No, we shit on these guys.

1077
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,000
We just need better focus.

1078
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,540
If we just look at the same thing, we win.

1079
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:08,760
GG.

1080
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,200
Dude, we're unsolvable.

1081
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,720
That's kind of how I feel.

1082
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,280
I consistently have people one hit, two hit, whatever.

1083
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,440
And I don't feel like I'm too deep in but they're not dying.

1084
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,100
I feel like we're just not looking at the same stuff.

1085
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,060
True.

1086
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,180
Well, sometimes not everyone can hit the same target because there's different things going on.

1087
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:30,740
True.

1088
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,940
Also true.

1089
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,920
Alright, so Trifor and I are just gonna run Widow, Mantis.

1090
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,660
Where are you guys gonna run?

1091
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,300
At best, we think just play what you're most comfortable with.

1092
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,340
I'm gonna be on Widow.

1093
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,940
Yeah, aren't you gonna be on Widow?

1094
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,060
You can play Widow.

1095
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,660
I play on Widow.

1096
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,280
I don't give a fuck.

1097
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,760
Just by the way, I looked at...

1098
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,320
Most likely, Trifor and I are just gonna run flank and stuff so you guys just head up the front line so we won't see what's going on.

1099
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,660
Okay, sure.

1100
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,000
Are we all ready?

1101
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,680
Yeah.

1102
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,440
Guys, at least we get $1,000.

1103
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,180
Wait a minute, this may not work against this team.

1104
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,160
Oh, that's true.

1105
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,220
Wait, actually this team is tryhard as fuck.

1106
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,860
It may not work against this team.

1107
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,880
You're right.

1108
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,740
I just noticed all the ranks.

1109
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,860
We're against the titans right now.

1110
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,920
Who the fuck is LeBron James?

1111
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,720
Is that the real LeBron?

1112
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,500
Yeah, that's the real LeBron James.

1113
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,500
LeBron, you play Rivals?

1114
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,260
Alright.

1115
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,100
I love you.

1116
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,940
What if I just go Mr. Fantastic?

1117
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,860
You're gonna get shredded so fucking hard.

1118
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,500
I know the flank Mr. Fantastic.

1119
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,860
I would love to see it.

1120
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,300
Alright, I'll go Mr. Fantastic.

1121
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,260
I'm done.

1122
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,700
The Pop-Tart man.

1123
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,460
Wait, this is unironically my best map.

1124
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,220
Really?

1125
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,440
I think my winner is like 70%.

1126
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,320
I don't know why.

1127
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,240
Yeah, we're gonna make it 50% tonight.

1128
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,220
We're gonna make it 60%.

1129
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,160
Bring that shit down.

1130
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,240
Alright,

1131
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,000
we'll just... unless we want to wait for Toast to ping.

1132
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,200
Does he actually ping us?

1133
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,340
I was not paying attention.

1134
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,500
I just kept going.

1135
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,940
The second one, he said, once you're ready, feel free to go log in too.

1136
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,640
Yeah, once we're ready.

1137
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,120
Oh, we were ready in like ban phase.

1138
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,000
Alright, nice.

1139
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:25,720
I'm going in.

1140
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,900
He said, once you're ready.

1141
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,920
I was like, alright, I'm definitely ready.

1142
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,620
We don't really play Loki, right?

1143
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,080
I play Loki, but I can do Loki.

1144
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,140
Because I know more as a Loki enthusiast.

1145
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,520
Well, yeah, then we'll just ban Loki then.

1146
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,180
Because he's like the most annoying support.

1147
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,380
You're captain, by the way.

1148
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,020
Uh, Lulu.

1149
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,700
Oh, shit.

1150
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,840
Yeah, just ban... I mean, we can ban Loki.

1151
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,320
Just fuck more.

1152
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,660
Fuck him, I guess.

1153
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,580
Aw, what?

1154
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,740
Did they hear us wanting to play Mantis Widow?

1155
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,020
Yeah, they're watching the stream.

1156
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,280
What the fuck?

1157
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,840
Wait, what the heck?

1158
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,160
No, it's because... it's because...

1159
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,960
Hune more on the enemy team.

1160
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,900
Whenever I six stack them, we just go Mantis Widow.

1161
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,140
We are doing Loki, right?

1162
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,840
Yeah, Loki.

1163
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,220
That was crazy.

1164
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,580
All good.

1165
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,780
Two Widow players.

1166
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,360
Wait, who are we protecting?

1167
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,000
Honestly, like, there's nothing...

1168
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,700
We just keep doing the thing because we don't really have a thing that we need to protect.

1169
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,680
That's fine.

1170
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,150
Like, all of us have characters that we want to play.

1171
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,190
Yeah.

1172
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,470
We could also keep Mag, because both our tanks can Mag.

1173
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,370
That's true.

1174
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,450
I don't think they are going to ban Mag, though.

1175
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,230
I don't have a thing.

1176
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:44,670
I like thing.

1177
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,130
Um...

1178
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:46,830
The thing.

1179
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:49,290
We could ban Namor here.

1180
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,070
Just because I don't want to play against Namor.

1181
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:53,570
You know what?

1182
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:54,490
Let's do that.

1183
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:56,230
Let's have a Namor free game.

1184
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,410
Every game has a fucking ugly ass hello, bro.

1185
00:50:59,130 --> 00:50:59,550
Yo, chill.

1186
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:00,370
Sorry.

1187
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,470
Yo.

1188
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,530
Just fucking playing aim labs on my fucking head.

1189
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,670
Yeah, I totally didn't play hello last few games.

1190
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,990
All good.

1191
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,430
Oh, God.

1192
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,090
What are you going to ban, Mr. Fantastic?

1193
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:13,770
Oh, Luna.

1194
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:14,370
Okay.

1195
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:17,470
Um...

1196
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:18,970
Don't ban Namor.

1197
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:19,650
Don't ban Namor.

1198
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,670
It doesn't matter.

1199
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,570
If they ban Luna, we can still have...

1200
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,750
Namor is, like, obsolete.

1201
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,310
I mean, we could just ban...

1202
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:28,790
They might go Rocket Punisher.

1203
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,150
Then we ban Rocket.

1204
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,290
Maybe.

1205
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,730
Okay, ban Rocket.

1206
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,480
Alright.

1207
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,840
Uh...

1208
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,720
I mean...

1209
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,780
Yeah, I can go still here.

1210
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,000
Ooh.

1211
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,920
You believe in your...

1212
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,660
Do you believe in your Starlord surefire?

1213
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,240
Uh...

1214
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,660
If I get Megabubbles mid-game?

1215
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,700
Eh, yeah.

1216
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,620
You can try that.

1217
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,900
Whenever he E's, you bubble him.

1218
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,000
Boom.

1219
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,640
Sir, yes, sir.

1220
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,820
We could just comment.

1221
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,300
They might run Spidey combo.

1222
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,180
I don't think...

1223
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,520
I don't...

1224
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,240
I don't think duo...

1225
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,440
I feel like if we're at it, we'll watch E for E support.

1226
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,120
Oh, this is such a widow map.

1227
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,220
That's true.

1228
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,000
Alright, I'll just...

1229
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,820
I'll just E then.

1230
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,340
I think, like...

1231
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,080
It works if, like...

1232
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,300
We can scrim...

1233
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,240
If we scrim with it, but...

1234
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,250
Yeah, I thought this was...

1235
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,590
Fucking Hall of Jala.

1236
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,070
We had, like, the wrong maps locked in.

1237
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:39,850
Is this what this is called?

1238
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,030
I thought it was the other Panther map.

1239
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,410
No, it's this one.

1240
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:43,950
Yeah, that threw me too.

1241
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,910
I thought the Hall was, like, the domination map.

1242
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,170
Yeah.

1243
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,390
Okay, that's the one I'm...

1244
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,110
We can crack that.

1245
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,450
They didn't say anything, so I don't know if I picked...

1246
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,330
Did I pick the wrong map?

1247
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,490
I don't...

1248
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,350
I really...

1249
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,250
I don't think they care.

1250
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,450
Oh, that's fine.

1251
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,730
I don't think they care.

1252
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,130
This is a content creator.

1253
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,550
It's alright.

1254
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,510
They got a magic.

1255
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:02,410
They have a thing.

1256
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:02,730
Thing.

1257
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:04,710
I didn't...

1258
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,210
Yeah, they're gonna dive by the looks of it.

1259
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:06,850
They're gonna dive?

1260
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:07,950
Okay, I'll try to push the point.

1261
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,610
Hey, Thomasline's on you.

1262
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,230
I'll try to save bubble.

1263
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,610
Magic going high ground.

1264
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:14,590
I know.

1265
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,230
I think they're all up there.

1266
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:16,910
They're all going high.

1267
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,410
All up there.

1268
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:17,930
All high.

1269
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,110
Uh, thing is...

1270
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,810
They're going back.

1271
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,350
They're going backline.

1272
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,210
They're going back all the way back.

1273
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:23,970
All the way back.

1274
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:24,950
They're gonna flank us.

1275
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,070
Yeah.

1276
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,450
I'm out of HP.

1277
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:25,750
I'm out of HP.

1278
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,570
I'm all the way around.

1279
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:26,910
Cool.

1280
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,050
They have no mag bubble.

1281
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,110
Nice.

1282
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:32,370
One.

1283
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:35,670
Nice.

1284
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,810
We can push up with this one.

1285
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,310
I pushed.

1286
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:38,770
Hold him back.

1287
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:39,170
I'm holding.

1288
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:41,590
Surround.

1289
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:41,830
Surround.

1290
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:42,550
He can't get up there.

1291
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,210
That's fine.

1292
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,070
Wait, someone's down.

1293
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:44,430
Got it.

1294
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:44,910
Hold on.

1295
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:45,610
Adam fell.

1296
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,170
Adam fell.

1297
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:46,750
Chasing.

1298
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:47,770
Okay, nice.

1299
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,290
Sagger him if needed.

1300
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:50,350
Good shit.

1301
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:52,630
They're all down.

1302
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:54,050
Yay!

1303
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,090
We can get up.

1304
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,810
I've never seen somebody go all the way around on that.

1305
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:00,490
That was crazy.

1306
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,990
Literally, you can ult face.

1307
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,230
I have a Bucky now.

1308
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,390
I don't know if they always had it.

1309
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,270
Nah.

1310
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,650
He was on Najik.

1311
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:08,590
Oh, yeah.

1312
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:10,690
They're hooks.

1313
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,110
They're going right again, I think.

1314
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,250
No, they're main.

1315
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:15,510
They're main.

1316
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,050
They're main.

1317
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,870
The thing is up top.

1318
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:20,790
Don't die, man.

1319
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:23,550
Oh, wow.

1320
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:24,290
I'm dying.

1321
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,930
Yeah, we're trying our best to heal you.

1322
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,730
You guys were taking too much damage.

1323
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,910
No, I...

1324
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:29,110
Jesus.

1325
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,570
Forgot that I can't shift if you shift.

1326
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:35,470
You guys...

1327
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,230
I don't know.

1328
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,570
Yeah, I don't think we can contest it.

1329
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,110
Oh, no, I'm fucked up.

1330
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:45,110
I already...

1331
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,110
I got it, I got it.

1332
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,990
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

1333
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:57,350
I can't push that guy away.

1334
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,210
He's hooking, careful.

1335
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,410
Okay, reset, reset.

1336
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,960
Let's make sure we don't overlap support ults.

1337
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:09,580
Oh, no.

1338
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,540
Lose first, lose first.

1339
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,540
We can use this to...

1340
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,980
Use it to go in.

1341
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,220
Not yet, not yet, though.

1342
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:14,820
Okay, are we ready?

1343
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,020
No, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.

1344
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,700
We don't have everybody.

1345
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,500
Someone's above us.

1346
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,140
Yeah, it's the thing.

1347
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,680
Funky's up there.

1348
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,100
Yeah.

1349
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,380
We can...

1350
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,400
Maybe think flank too.

1351
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,000
I got spawn camp.

1352
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,300
Okay, I think we have to use it to engage at this corner.

1353
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,560
Just because, like...

1354
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,040
We can wait for them.

1355
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,920
There's a hellion high ground.

1356
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,260
Come on, I have to.

1357
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,100
I don't have to do it now.

1358
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,700
That's fine.

1359
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,800
That's a good ult, that's a good ult.

1360
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:35,320
What?

1361
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,220
I was out of it?

1362
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,460
Alright, I'm gonna ult backline.

1363
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,340
I'm gonna hold it, though.

1364
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,020
Waiting.

1365
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,440
I'm coming back.

1366
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,460
Okay, well...

1367
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,020
We'll probably be fine.

1368
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,600
Hellion's on this corner.

1369
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,960
Oh, I got shiny.

1370
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,620
I'm gonna use it just to stall.

1371
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,680
I pulled him in.

1372
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,360
I pulled people in.

1373
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,380
Oh, I'm dead.

1374
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,800
Bucky can die in the back.

1375
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,400
Bucky is one.

1376
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:03,980
We got Bucky.

1377
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,500
Hold on.

1378
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,020
I don't have...

1379
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,280
Okay, I'm just trying to keep you alive.

1380
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:10,660
Okay, okay.

1381
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,860
Coney, careful.

1382
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:12,860
Yep, yep.

1383
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,680
Wait, look ping, look ping.

1384
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,000
They rezzed.

1385
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:15,780
Yeah.

1386
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,100
Jesus.

1387
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,120
We're trying to keep you guys alive here.

1388
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,140
We have to touch, we have to touch.

1389
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,460
Yeah, someone touch, someone touch.

1390
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:21,920
I got one.

1391
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,640
Just keep, just keep...

1392
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:22,960
I'll try.

1393
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,100
Wait, kill the Bucky.

1394
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,900
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1395
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,660
What the fuck is he doing?

1396
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,720
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

1397
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,000
There's a HelloHyga.

1398
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,040
HelloHyga is still here.

1399
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,960
HelloHyga is still.

1400
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,640
Which... oh, top left.

1401
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,260
Oh my god.

1402
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,040
No, no, no, no.

1403
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,160
Right when I hit my Q.

1404
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,920
There's an Adam2 behind us too.

1405
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,180
Adam, yeah, I can't.

1406
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,260
You guys have...

1407
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,360
I'm just trying to stay on point.

1408
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,100
You have no supports, you have no supports.

1409
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:53,840
Yeah.

1410
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,940
Alright, I'm just gonna...

1411
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,940
back here.

1412
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,900
Yeah, they had people that were really out of position there.

1413
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,480
Like, I killed two just because they walked up.

1414
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,900
Just calm where, like, Hella was top left.

1415
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,180
Calm like where you see her.

1416
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,340
Yeah, I pinged her.

1417
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,280
I was like, Hella up top.

1418
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,400
Stay left for me though.

1419
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,580
Because I thought it was right high ground.

1420
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,720
That's where I see Hella's usually.

1421
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,800
It's a weird spot.

1422
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,900
Maybe this guy's just too high ELO for my brain.

1423
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,180
No, he's a COD player.

1424
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:23,980
He's a COD player.

1425
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,620
Oh, too low ELO for my brain.

1426
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,280
Didn't he win, like, championships though?

1427
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,220
Okay, too high ELO.

1428
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:33,920
Hella's top left.

1429
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,140
Use ult, use ult, use ult.

1430
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,380
I don't have my ult yet.

1431
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,700
I'm shielding.

1432
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,160
I got it.

1433
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,760
Okay, nice.

1434
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,260
Good shield.

1435
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,200
Oh my god.

1436
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,000
We're up one.

1437
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,780
We can push up.

1438
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,780
Yeah, push up.

1439
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,860
Okay, we stopped it, we stopped it.

1440
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:52,860
This guy's one.

1441
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,600
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam.

1442
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,420
Push it up, push it up, push it up.

1443
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,620
Just push up, push up, push up.

1444
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,860
I pulled him back, I pulled him back.

1445
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,080
Thank you.

1446
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:00,480
I got you.

1447
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,080
No, we can keep pushing.

1448
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,660
Dude, fuck these guys.

1449
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,460
They're like three alive.

1450
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,100
We can't push anymore, we can't push anymore, we can't push anymore.

1451
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,680
That's their spawn.

1452
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,380
Wait, kill this thing, kill this thing.

1453
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,700
Alright, good.

1454
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,240
Let's push it back.

1455
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,940
Because like, two of them are dead, plus they're like...

1456
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,960
Yeah, but respawn was coming in.

1457
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1458
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,880
But we gotta fuck with their mental.

1459
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,060
I can bubble you if you're stuck.

1460
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,060
You can jump to me, I think.

1461
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:25,700
Okay.

1462
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,440
He's gonna, uh, burn it if we can.

1463
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,840
At best I can give a shield, but I'm just gonna back up.

1464
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,640
I'm in this hallway.

1465
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:32,820
It's burned, it's burned.

1466
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,120
I couldn't heal you in time.

1467
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,520
Oh, I got hooked.

1468
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,460
We can't do anything, there's a health on us.

1469
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:39,720
Yeah, I'm dead.

1470
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,900
I tried to jump-save, but...

1471
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,160
If we reset here, we have time.

1472
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,500
I think I can jump if time I can.

1473
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,360
No, what?

1474
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,000
He randomly shot that.

1475
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,800
That's crazy.

1476
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,300
That was a good play by him.

1477
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,300
Have ults up once we're all here.

1478
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:00,760
Yeah.

1479
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,620
Alright, I'm dashing in.

1480
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,640
Just gonna stay on point.

1481
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,680
Bucky's on the right.

1482
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,360
Hella one, hella one!

1483
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,220
Sniping this guy!

1484
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,760
Wait, he died.

1485
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,060
I was behind the walls.

1486
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,760
I have my ult.

1487
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,780
I'm about to use it.

1488
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,200
Weird.

1489
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,960
You have shield, you have shield on him!

1490
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,920
You have shield, shield, shield, shield!

1491
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,720
I got it, I got it.

1492
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,320
Kill the mag, kill the mag!

1493
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,040
I pulled mag, I pulled mag, I pulled mag!

1494
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,140
Oh, he got those.

1495
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,500
I don't know where he was.

1496
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,780
Okay, good warm-up, we win now.

1497
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,680
We warm up until we win, is that it?

1498
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,900
It's T-sided, it's T-sided.

1499
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,200
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the background.

1500
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm just gonna run at him.

1501
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,180
I will bring peace to this universe, no matter the cost.

1502
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,200
Let me know...

1503
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,200
Let me know, like...

1504
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,780
A bit before the fight, you're gonna cloak ult?

1505
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,320
I'll save bubble.

1506
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:11,400
Okay.

1507
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,720
I don't know, I actually don't know what...

1508
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,980
Matches are rough, guys.

1509
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,440
Should've done that.

1510
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,720
Matches are...

1511
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,640
I got killed in both my ults, all good.

1512
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,640
Matches are rough, guys.

1513
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,700
But it's okay.

1514
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:29,740
At least...

1515
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,080
Last night, I gained 100 points and I'm on the leaderboard.

1516
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,280
That's all that matters to me.

1517
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,300
I'm trying, I'm trying my best.

1518
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,920
I'm trying my best.

1519
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,820
It's okay, everybody...

1520
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,820
The price difference is...

1521
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,480
I believe like...

1522
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,560
I think it's like $1,000?

1523
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:00,920
I think, I don't know.

1524
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,860
Even last place gets $1,000.

1525
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,440
And I think first place gets $1,700.

1526
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,640
So I'm okay with that.

1527
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:09,760
Yeah, we got it.

1528
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,160
I'll swap off if it doesn't work.

1529
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,920
I think...

1530
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,820
Jake, maybe go Bucky if...

1531
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,280
Psylocke doesn't work.

1532
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,460
Yeah, I could go Bucky.

1533
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,460
Or like...

1534
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,120
Punisher.

1535
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:24,920
Yeah.

1536
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,320
There's a Hella behind Flanky.

1537
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,960
I have to use both snaps.

1538
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,860
Actually, I'm gonna go high ground.

1539
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1540
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,180
Hard left, hard left.

1541
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:33,500
Come on.

1542
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,130
They're on high ground.

1543
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,210
No, they're on top right.

1544
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,630
Just fight here, just fight here.

1545
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,890
Ken can't move, Ken can't move.

1546
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:46,710
Nice, nice.

1547
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:47,590
We got pick.

1548
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,230
I'm just gonna...

1549
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,070
I'm soulbonding us and we go for it.

1550
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,530
Go for it, I soulbonded us.

1551
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1552
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:53,690
I'm walking, I'm walking.

1553
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,470
Look, Mag.

1554
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,110
Or Thing... or Wanda, actually.

1555
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:58,450
Yeah, Wanda, Wanda.

1556
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,850
Nice.

1557
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:00,970
Thing, Thing, Thing, Thing.

1558
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,530
Thing one, Thing low.

1559
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:04,350
Thing, focus Thing.

1560
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,250
Focus Thing again.

1561
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,250
Yeah.

1562
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:07,430
Focus Thing.

1563
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,510
Don't... Thing is 1 HP.

1564
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:09,430
Yeah.

1565
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,430
Now you can get the high ground if you want to.

1566
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,600
Alright, good claim.

1567
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,400
Yay.

1568
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,660
You're killing them before I can bust.

1569
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,740
Oh, I'm surprised he's gonna stay at Scarlet.

1570
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,600
The Cosmos heal.

1571
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,320
I have Res soon.

1572
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,480
I got Cloak ult.

1573
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,380
I'm just gonna...

1574
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,640
We don't have any ults because we engaged so fast, so...

1575
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,400
Jesus.

1576
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,020
I'm gonna go up near Wanda.

1577
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,060
That's you.

1578
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,020
I'm gonna go up here and look for flank if...

1579
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,820
Careful, careful.

1580
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,740
You're by yourself, Strange.

1581
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,400
Yeah, yeah.

1582
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,900
Thing is, like, not with you.

1583
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,100
Yeah, I'm gonna go around and go to...

1584
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,880
and flank if I can get time.

1585
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,860
I am strengthened for battle.

1586
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:58,880
Alright.

1587
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,100
I have Res.

1588
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,840
Nevermind, I'm coming up front.

1589
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,800
Yeah, that's a good ult.

1590
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,680
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

1591
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,480
I'm just gonna Res.

1592
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,440
I'm gonna Agumon off this.

1593
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:09,920
I have...

1594
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,380
I'm just gonna save.

1595
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,480
Save my Res.

1596
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,040
I'm gonna wait.

1597
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:15,960
Blocked it.

1598
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,140
Nice.

1599
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:18,920
Thing's on me in the back.

1600
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:19,820
I'm getting punched.

1601
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,780
See ya.

1602
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,000
Okay, I'm Resing this then.

1603
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,560
You should be fine.

1604
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,260
Yep.

1605
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,800
I'm solo botting.

1606
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,240
You can go up with it.

1607
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,220
I'm staying on point.

1608
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,040
Back up, back up again, back up again.

1609
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:33,800
That's a...

1610
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:34,800
Scarlet ult.

1611
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,400
That's huge, that's huge, that's a huge ult.

1612
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,420
I need heals though.

1613
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,380
I'm gonna swap out Adam now.

1614
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,340
I think...

1615
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,180
I'm gonna ult and swap.

1616
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,560
That's fine.

1617
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,340
Tripper got two.

1618
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,710
Wait, they're only one healer right now, Fee.

1619
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,070
Oh, we're a bit saggy.

1620
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,030
No, we're saggy.

1621
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,250
Yeah, it's saggy.

1622
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:01,650
It's fine.

1623
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,790
Um, they have...

1624
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,570
They used Herald, they used...

1625
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,490
Alright, I'm gonna go inside...

1626
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,970
I'm gonna go inside this building and get backline with ult.

1627
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,390
Just gonna go up here.

1628
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:13,730
See if I can get it.

1629
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,010
Just waiting for space.

1630
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:17,870
Alright, going backline.

1631
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,030
I pulled Mag back.

1632
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:23,450
I can block his healing.

1633
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:24,590
Mag is one.

1634
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:25,530
Oh, unlucky.

1635
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:26,150
There's no healing.

1636
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:26,690
Yeah.

1637
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,030
I got him.

1638
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,250
Oh, unlucky.

1639
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,510
Think, think, think, think, think.

1640
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,830
Burn, burn Hela, burn.

1641
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,410
We had to burn Hela.

1642
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:34,830
One healer.

1643
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,230
We had to burn Hela there.

1644
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,910
That's okay.

1645
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,310
Hey, Timmy, big fan.

1646
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:40,790
Kill him.

1647
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:41,050
He's not pushing.

1648
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:45,370
Careful, you're by yourself, Strange.

1649
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:46,270
Yeah, I'm okay.

1650
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:48,890
You only have Mia's healing.

1651
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:49,690
I'm playing two, like, beta.

1652
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:50,810
I gotta walk into these guys.

1653
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:51,990
Type shit.

1654
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:54,050
Well, there was only three of us, so...

1655
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,090
Off-angle DPSes.

1656
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:55,650
There's a...

1657
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,050
Hela to the left, Hela to the left.

1658
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:57,550
I pinged it.

1659
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,030
I have my ult, too.

1660
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,570
I'm gonna get purple here.

1661
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,150
I don't have a choice.

1662
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:03,690
I'm gonna pull down.

1663
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:06,690
No!

1664
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:09,950
I got, I got...

1665
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:10,550
Oh, look, think, think.

1666
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,670
I think we reset.

1667
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:13,350
No, reset.

1668
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:14,910
Oh, I got it.

1669
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:15,610
I'm just gonna die here.

1670
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:26,720
I have an Agamotto.

1671
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,920
I thought you wouldn't see me again.

1672
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,820
Can't wait to get pulled by Invisible Woman.

1673
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,400
They have Mag...

1674
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,460
They have Mag ult.

1675
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:32,240
Here.

1676
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:37,540
Okay.

1677
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
I have my...

1678
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Lulu, you go first.

1679
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:40,800
Yes.

1680
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:41,920
Okay.

1681
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:43,960
Do you want me to engage with mine?

1682
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,540
Um, we can use for engagement.

1683
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,280
They don't...

1684
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,480
They have one aggressive ult here.

1685
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:47,900
Hooking, hooking.

1686
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:53,830
Did you have bubble for her?

1687
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:55,650
Chill, then got it.

1688
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,990
Nice, nice, nice.

1689
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,410
You hope they both push me?

1690
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:00,190
I, uh...

1691
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,990
Pulled.

1692
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:01,950
We're back.

1693
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:02,830
Big bust.

1694
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,210
Oh, wow.

1695
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:03,610
Huge.

1696
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:04,830
Big bust.

1697
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:05,930
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

1698
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:06,530
Got...

1699
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:06,770
Nice.

1700
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:07,090
Okay.

1701
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,290
Think, think, think.

1702
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,270
Someone's still above us.

1703
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:10,790
Who's above us?

1704
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:11,230
Who's above us?

1705
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,250
Bucky, Bucky's behind.

1706
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:12,910
Above and behind.

1707
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:14,970
I can't chase him.

1708
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,650
I'm stuck in this room.

1709
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:17,890
Oh, he has...

1710
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,870
He has this again.

1711
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,380
But he has Mantis ult, though.

1712
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,980
Mantis, Bucky.

1713
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:25,780
I want them to kill me.

1714
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:26,160
Hey, guys.

1715
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,340
Uh-oh.

1716
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,100
Uh-oh.

1717
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,340
Goodbye, Surefour.

1718
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:32,700
Oh, you didn't get the reset.

1719
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:33,880
I can portal.

1720
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:34,260
I can portal.

1721
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,380
Actually, we probably should just walk.

1722
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,980
So I can portal last fight if we need to.

1723
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:39,900
You'll have to...

1724
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,300
Alright, we'll have to die first, then.

1725
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,360
That's up to you.

1726
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,820
We don't have time for a portal, but...

1727
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,580
Yeah, I think we're off.

1728
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,140
I'm gonna tank some damage.

1729
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,060
We can get healer ult charge.

1730
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:55,960
See me?

1731
01:06:59,240 --> 01:06:59,600
Oh!

1732
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,620
Oh, everyone's low.

1733
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,020
I have ult for this charge.

1734
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,000
Yeah, I'm just waiting.

1735
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,400
Burn, burn that burn.

1736
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,200
Burn however you can.

1737
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,060
Burn however you can.

1738
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,820
Burn her, burn her, burn.

1739
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:10,480
She's barely one.

1740
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:11,580
She's down.

1741
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,060
Okay.

1742
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:12,680
Alright.

1743
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,220
I'm gonna walk up.

1744
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:14,340
Running in with ult.

1745
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:14,980
Running in with ult.

1746
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:15,420
One second.

1747
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,180
Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

1748
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,400
Come on, Mantis.

1749
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:21,740
Nice.

1750
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,620
Mantis, Mantis.

1751
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:22,880
Nice.

1752
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:23,800
That's huge, that's huge, that's huge.

1753
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,360
Help her, help her, help her.

1754
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,640
I'll pop myself up.

1755
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,400
Oh, I...

1756
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:31,920
Oh, I'm dying.

1757
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,440
That thing is on me.

1758
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,000
There is a...

1759
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,020
We have a cloak on point.

1760
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,120
It's gonna be gone.

1761
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,220
It's gone now.

1762
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,900
Try to stall until invis ult.

1763
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:47,740
I'm one, I'm one.

1764
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,920
I'm coming back.

1765
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,020
Bye, everybody.

1766
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,020
I'll see you all die in front of me.

1767
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,420
Damn.

1768
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:01,940
Hey, good warm-up, actually.

1769
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:02,880
Good warm-up, good warm-up.

1770
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,040
Hello, good warm-up, guys.

1771
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,060
GG.

1772
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:19,520
Hey, whoever that Magneto is, he only ulted my shield like five times.

1773
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,620
Oh, he's Eternity.

1774
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,820
Okay, well...

1775
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:28,580
It wasn't bad, I was just...

1776
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,360
I don't know.

1777
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,260
I feel like we should have capped.

1778
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,940
I guess, I think their Hela killed like eight at one point.

1779
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,780
We didn't burn Hela the first time, so like...

1780
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,160
We just let her stay up in the air.

1781
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:41,980
The old game.

1782
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,100
It's worse though.

1783
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,800
It's just like little things, honestly.

1784
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:48,720
It's alright.

1785
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,300
Yeah.

1786
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:50,940
Yeah.

1787
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,960
Okay, now we can run Mantis.

1788
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:55,880
Wait, who are we playing against?

1789
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:56,660
Oh, wait, no.

1790
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,500
Fuck, it's Nekros.

1791
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,400
No, actually, Nekros is just Andrew and Nekros.

1792
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,380
And we just banned Venom Spider because they've been fucking running that the entire time in rank.

1793
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,340
It's terrible.

1794
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,540
Spider-Man, one trick.

1795
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,160
Yeah, I had to deal with that in rank last week.

1796
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,800
So, it was not fun.

1797
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,000
We just banned Venom Spider because Andrew is like the number one Venom right now in...

1798
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:20,840
in EU.

1799
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,480
We can only ban one.

1800
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,440
They're gonna save one.

1801
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,060
Oh, it's true.

1802
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,280
We just banned Venom.

1803
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,320
Andrew only plays Venom.

1804
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,620
From all the times I've gotten him.

1805
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:34,020
I mean, he played Mag and Strange, but his Venom is actually so fucking annoying.

1806
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:36,880
Yeah.

1807
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,200
I mean, like...

1808
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:38,880
I hate Venom.

1809
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,780
Nekros Spider-Man is also annoying, but like, I'd rather just not deal with a Venom.

1810
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:46,080
Oh, really?

1811
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:46,940
I was thinking...

1812
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,420
Oh, yeah, I'm done.

1813
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:47,940
Fuck it.

1814
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:56,020
No, I had to play against that for last week, and I'd rather deal with Nekros Spider-Man than Andrew's Venom.

1815
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,380
Because Venom has too much HP.

1816
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,680
The problem with dealing with Spider-Man though is that like, we're gonna get clip farmed.

1817
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,800
That's fine, I already got clip farmed.

1818
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,400
He already clip farmed me, I'm okay with that.

1819
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:09,580
Wait, what?

1820
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,140
You played against the Spider-Man, right?

1821
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,160
Yeah, no, I played against him.

1822
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,120
Did you kill him on Widow or no?

1823
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,280
He played Panther, but...

1824
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,640
Well, I think... I had a few kills on him for sure.

1825
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:25,840
But, it wasn't like anything... I don't know.

1826
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,840
It wasn't like notable or anything.

1827
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,020
Do you want me to add him against dive or should I say tank?

1828
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,080
I don't care.

1829
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,120
I am a listener.

1830
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,180
Should we just run Strange Mag and see if that works?

1831
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,520
Are you okay with running Strange Mag?

1832
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,080
Yeah, that's good with me.

1833
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,700
That's true, he did say he couldn't kill my Widow.

1834
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,380
Let's just run Strange Mag.

1835
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,120
Just play around with comps.

1836
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,320
And see what works.

1837
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,500
Necros is still in the game though, so I can't invite him.

1838
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,840
That means we have to wait.

1839
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:57,640
Yeah, no.

1840
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:00,560
No.

1841
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,120
No tears, only dreams.

1842
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,480
Should we still try Mantis Widow against Necros?

1843
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,660
I'm down to try anything.

1844
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,280
I'll even lock the Mr. Fantastic.

1845
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,990
I'll play anything.

1846
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:36,030
I'm trying my best.

1847
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,750
Guys, I'm trying my best.

1848
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,090
I don't know if my comps are bad or not.

1849
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:46,590
I don't know.

1850
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:51,370
I don't know if my comps are not good enough or something.

1851
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:55,990
I feel like I'm the only one talking.

1852
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:07,330
I feel like I'm the only one talking right now.

1853
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,470
So I'm just like, I don't know.

1854
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,130
I'm just like, I'm trying.

1855
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,450
I'm trying my best to support him.

1856
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:25,430
Yeah.

1857
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,790
The vibes aren't peak.

1858
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,530
I don't know what to do.

1859
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,490
Everyone's just sad that they're losing and I'm like, I'm trying.

1860
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:44,470
And also, we did have like a last minute substitute too.

1861
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,330
Because Wig dropped out.

1862
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:47,930
I have returned.

1863
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:54,470
So like we did have like a last minute substitute and everything too.

1864
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,810
I'm going to watch a motivational speech.

1865
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:00,070
We're going to fucking glorp on these guys.

1866
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,770
Let me get Tony Hype the fuck up.

1867
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:03,430
David Goggins.

1868
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:05,230
I'm not a motivational speaker, guys.

1869
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,770
Do you have a good motivational speech?

1870
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,130
No, I just watch like the cringe compilation.

1871
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,390
I thought all of this was doom posting.

1872
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,910
Stay hard!

1873
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,170
I don't do this because I want to do this.

1874
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,150
He's kind of doom posting.

1875
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,390
Isn't he the guy that is in all the like sad boy movies?

1876
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,470
It's okay, just like last time.

1877
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,690
Wait, no, who are you thinking of?

1878
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,810
Just like last time, I'll feel better by playing quick play.

1879
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:25,190
Is it Ryan Gosling?

1880
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,910
Why is it David Goggins?

1881
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:28,670
Oh.

1882
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,710
Don't worry about it, I'm cooked.

1883
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,110
Oh my god, bro.

1884
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:39,690
Okay, this Astron guy was like in my chat, like in the waiting room, capping out my waiting room.

1885
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:43,370
And was like, I better not see you in Gomez and Rink, you're going to regret it.

1886
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,010
Who the fuck are you?

1887
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:48,390
We have a high win percent rate, so I'm pretty sure we won again.

1888
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:53,110
He starts his fucking short, like running.

1889
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:55,870
A guy asked me, what do you want?

1890
01:13:55,870 --> 01:14:01,690
Like, their date night is just like his girlfriend's husband's wife driving the car behind him.

1891
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:06,110
It could have been like someone that Gomez blames, honestly, and then he's like taking it out on me.

1892
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:09,770
Because I don't even talk in game at all, other than comming.

1893
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:18,830
But Gomez blames people, so like, it could be him taking it out on me because he's too scared to like, to like say anything to Gomez.

1894
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,150
That's like all I can think about.

1895
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,470
You think you can do that?

1896
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:30,810
Who the fuck is... oh wait, I think it's because like, I made it open to all.

1897
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:32,830
Okay, invitational only.

1898
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,330
Yeah, so, because like, I don't say anything in chat.

1899
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:49,070
The most I did was like, the most I did was, could you swap off, please?

1900
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,530
And that's all I say.

1901
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,710
I also don't have you added.

1902
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:55,310
Add Glorpfan5000.

1903
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,810
It's like the dog that only barks.

1904
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:58,890
Oh wait, he's here.

1905
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,970
Okay, nice.

1906
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,250
Yeah, it's random.

1907
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:12,370
No, people take, I mean, I took rank very seriously because I was like, I just want to be on the leaderboards.

1908
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:19,970
Because like, if anything bad happens in this tournament, at least I can be happy about like, my individual rank.

1909
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:34,470
I was just like, thinking like, okay, if I get too sad, I can just think about how much I climbed last night.

1910
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:38,570
And then that will make me at least a little happy.

1911
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:48,050
That's why I was like, I don't want to at least get on the leaderboards for this tournament.

1912
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,130
So like, I can be less sad.

1913
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,010
Because I was like, it's a creative tournament.

1914
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,750
Teams are obviously gonna be very RNG.

1915
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:59,310
Alright guys, the good news is both teams in this current match that is about to happen is 0-3.

1916
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,590
Holy shit, it's the comeback.

1917
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:03,130
Okay, so it's basically...

1918
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:08,170
We could get out of this loss streak by continuing theirs.

1919
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:09,390
Or...

1920
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:09,890
True!

1921
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,710
That's gonna happen to us.

1922
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:15,050
Alright, Kony, Kony motivate us.

1923
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,510
You're always the hype man, Kony.

1924
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,090
No!

1925
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:17,910
Now?

1926
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,130
Why is that my job?

1927
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:22,770
Our hype man isn't even hype!

1928
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,390
No, I'm scared.

1929
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:28,750
If they're 0-3, I don't want to be 0-4 to the 0-3 team.

1930
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,330
I'm scared now!

1931
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:31,670
Okay, wait, no, no.

1932
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:32,030
Pause.

1933
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,670
Pause.

1934
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:33,190
Pause.

1935
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:35,650
You're telling me you used to be a Smash player?

1936
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:36,910
Like a pro Smash player?

1937
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:39,370
What happened to your ego?

1938
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:43,310
Like, a decade and a half ago, maybe.

1939
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:44,450
Okay, but...

1940
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,490
You know what happened to my ego?

1941
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:49,670
Did you used to be... Did you compete in Smash?

1942
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,170
Yes or no?

1943
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,830
You know what happened to my ego?

1944
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:59,490
I kept... In the last few games, I've heard like, oh, Hella's high, Bucky's high, they're high ground, and I look up his thing, I'm like, I can't...

1945
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:01,130
I can't...

1946
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:08,750
This guy is literally telling me he's down three stocks, he's on his last stock, and he just jumps off the fucking map.

1947
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,510
That's what he does.

1948
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:10,210
He jumps off.

1949
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,510
That's what I'm fucking hearing right now.

1950
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:12,270
I actually do.

1951
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,430
I actually do.

1952
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:15,890
If I know we're not winning, but I know we're gonna win this.

1953
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,090
Oh my god.

1954
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:19,230
Oh my god.

1955
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,210
I'm sad now.

1956
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:23,730
That was the saddest speech I've ever heard.

1957
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:26,470
I'm literally not the loser.

1958
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,530
This dude's anti-hype, bro.

1959
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:29,890
Let me take your mental.

1960
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,390
This is anti-type.

1961
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,260
All good?

1962
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:36,700
Wait, what's the map?

1963
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,700
Oh, a spider... Wait, is this... Is Spider Islands the city or the doge?

1964
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:41,820
This is Gibraltar.

1965
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,100
What's the doge?

1966
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,620
This is Gibraltar, first point.

1967
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,300
A dojo.

1968
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,060
I like that one.

1969
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,580
Momentum is fragile.

1970
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:57,680
Takes a lifetime to build, but only a moment of neglect to lose.

1971
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,080
Think about that.

1972
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,500
Are you watching the David Goggins video right now?

1973
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,380
I'm reading a synopsis.

1974
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,020
A synopsis?

1975
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,540
You're watching or listening to it?

1976
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,440
You're reading it?

1977
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:11,740
Yo, chill.

1978
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,500
That was off the dome.

1979
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,880
How is that even motivational if you're reading it?

1980
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,640
You know when you unroll a toilet paper, right?

1981
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,360
If you roll it back, it's not going to be the same, okay?

1982
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,860
And now we're unrolling it that far.

1983
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,640
Yeah, why are you unrolling it?

1984
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,860
Why are you rolling too much of it?

1985
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,360
He's got a big-ass batch of fortune cookies he's reading from.

1986
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:29,960
I like that.

1987
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:30,720
That's very deep.

1988
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,520
You guys have no idea how many times he's said this to me before.

1989
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,280
He's just rolling out all his voice lines.

1990
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:36,180
Chill.

1991
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,480
Oh, he's doing his stim voices?

1992
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:39,960
Yeah.

1993
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,320
I have a thick of it on a soundboard.

1994
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,000
I could DMC all your VODs right now.

1995
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,920
Do it right now.

1996
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:47,920
Yo, yo, chill.

1997
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:48,960
Do it right now.

1998
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,620
I'd love to give that guy more money.

1999
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,040
Do it.

2000
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:53,600
Yeah.

2001
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,400
He needs it.

2002
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,920
Alright, I'm going to get demonetized on YouTube.

2003
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,260
No, that was like two seconds.

2004
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,000
Oh yeah, she's on YouTube.

2005
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:02,740
You killed her.

2006
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:03,800
You fucked me over.

2007
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,200
You actually fucked me over.

2008
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:06,520
Wow.

2009
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,180
When my team captain spoke, I listened.

2010
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:13,500
Of course, of course, of course you actually fucked me over.

2011
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,800
Don't let DokiBird gaslight you.

2012
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,420
It's women's month.

2013
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,160
It's every month.

2014
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,300
What an angle.

2015
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,920
How much backpedaling is this guy going to do?

2016
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:26,840
I know, right?

2017
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,860
Stand your ground for once.

2018
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,060
Doki, how much longer did you play that cheetah game?

2019
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,120
The cheetah game?

2020
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,640
After like an hour, I was like, I get it.

2021
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:42,140
Yeah, like after you left, I played like two more and I was like, okay, I'm done now.

2022
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,980
Yeah, I figured it was going to be like that.

2023
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:45,780
It's like, I get it.

2024
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,080
Okay.

2025
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,540
I'm done.

2026
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,780
Everybody can aim, but I get it now.

2027
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:58,400
Keep in mind, if we lose, not only are we on four, but we lose to TTV in name.

2028
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,620
Oh no.

2029
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,140
My viewers.

2030
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,900
They're all going to leave.

2031
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,160
I like the small TTV, though.

2032
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,180
That's kind of cool.

2033
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,940
I fuck with it.

2034
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:11,460
Oh my god, I didn't even notice the little TV.

2035
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,380
The all caps is kind of cringe.

2036
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,200
Yeah.

2037
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,760
I'm pretty sure that's a meme.

2038
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,580
Is that Andrew?

2039
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,080
Is it RickyTV?

2040
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,260
I was going to say, they only have two Eternity players.

2041
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,120
But it still does mental damage to us.

2042
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,000
To me, at least.

2043
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,460
Get that mental up, bro.

2044
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:30,580
I know.

2045
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,120
Who are you eating for?

2046
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,480
What if we level the playing fields and we play in Singapore servers?

2047
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,420
What if I just put West Coast on and just fuck over Nicklaus and Andrew?

2048
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,200
Nah, fuck the Europeans.

2049
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,240
Yeah, fuck the Europeans.

2050
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,140
That's what I'm saying.

2051
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,660
Wait, if Ricky is not Andrew?

2052
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,860
Who the fuck is Ricky?

2053
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,220
It's fucked up, man!

2054
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,140
Who's Ricky?

2055
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:59,000
I thought they only had two Eternity players.

2056
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,800
One above all.

2057
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,650
Ricky is supposed to be Celestial!

2058
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:08,170
Oh, I guess he ranked up.

2059
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,810
I mean, Celestial and Eternity are next to each other.

2060
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,750
Yo, why is there a Diamond in this lobby?

2061
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:13,910
Yo!

2062
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:15,890
I'm cooked!

2063
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:19,950
Alright, let me know when I...

2064
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,410
Okay, so did we decide we're banning Venom?

2065
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,250
Wait, what rank did you tell him I was?

2066
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:24,890
Venom?

2067
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:28,030
No, Toast asked for Diamond 1 to GM.

2068
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,470
Yeah, he was like, no Celestials.

2069
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:32,250
I wasn't yet.

2070
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:38,850
I don't know who Ricky is.

2071
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,570
Who is Ricky, guys?

2072
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:43,750
Is Twitch name actually just Ricky?

2073
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,770
He's a real person?

2074
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:47,170
I don't know.

2075
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,190
That's fucked up!

2076
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:48,690
I don't know.

2077
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,890
Oh my god, he's...

2078
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:54,050
Wait, he's not even... Oh no, he is real!

2079
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,790
Who's real?

2080
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:57,330
What did I miss?

2081
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,790
I was like, oh, he's the Call of Duty player.

2082
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:03,790
He's the COD player.

2083
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:05,970
I was gonna say.

2084
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:11,570
Alright, they are not ready yet, so I'm just gonna wait.

2085
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:14,290
Why not?

2086
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,890
I mean, we could start it now.

2087
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,270
Wait, how the fuck is this team 0-3?

2088
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:23,010
Yeah, I know.

2089
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:27,770
I mean, they might just target that Andrew Necros, honestly.

2090
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:29,070
They could have just done that.

2091
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:34,690
At this point, like, they gotta go for content, so surely they give us a win.

2092
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:37,030
Well, they want content as in they win.

2093
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:39,170
Okay, so we have one drawback, Doki.

2094
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:40,670
This map isn't good for Widow.

2095
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,690
Oh, that's true.

2096
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:44,770
This map's kinda ass.

2097
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:47,990
When will we ever be able to play Widow, Mantis?

2098
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:48,510
Next game.

2099
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,870
The last... The next game.

2100
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:54,550
Our Tuanta guy is like 50 hours Widow and like 1 hour everyone else.

2101
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:57,250
Okay, yo, you don't have to like keep saying that.

2102
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,410
No, that's not true.

2103
01:22:59,470 --> 01:22:59,770
That's not true.

2104
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:01,950
Okay, we win this.

2105
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:02,650
Am I banning Venom?

2106
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:04,090
Yeah.

2107
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:04,650
Or Spider.

2108
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:05,310
Venom.

2109
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,490
I don't want... I'd rather deal with a Spider-Man than a Venom.

2110
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,610
Venom just has too much HP.

2111
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:10,770
Okay.

2112
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,230
They're ready.

2113
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,670
Wait, they're going Dive?

2114
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:14,610
They're going for Dive.

2115
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,910
Let's do... We can still have Bucky.

2116
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,070
We can protect Bucky because they might try to ban Bucky.

2117
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:22,250
Sure.

2118
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:23,230
So ban Venom here?

2119
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:23,750
Yeah.

2120
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,610
At least we have Bucky for...

2121
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:32,350
At least we'll have Bucky to help with Dive.

2122
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,030
Yeah, protect Bucky.

2123
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:35,450
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

2124
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:45,850
And then they're just gonna protect Spider-Man so Necro can at least have fun out of the two.

2125
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:47,030
Bucky.

2126
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:51,350
So who are we banning third?

2127
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:53,350
Spider-Man.

2128
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,110
Oh, protect Mag.

2129
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,950
Yeah, I mean he plays... Yeah, I'd rather just ban Spider.

2130
01:23:58,610 --> 01:23:59,010
Well...

2131
01:23:59,010 --> 01:23:59,210
What?

2132
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:00,890
He might play Black Panther.

2133
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:02,950
Yes, I was thinking about that too.

2134
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:04,670
I was thinking he'll play Black Panther.

2135
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,750
It's up to you guys.

2136
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:08,710
Would you rather fight against Spider-Man or Panther?

2137
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,470
I don't care.

2138
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:12,590
It's up to healers, yeah.

2139
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:14,210
I hate Spider-Man but I'm a tank so who cares.

2140
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:16,050
I'd rather fight against...

2141
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,490
I don't care either way.

2142
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,170
It's up to you guys.

2143
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:22,270
I'm okay with either Spider or Panther.

2144
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:23,830
Other healer?

2145
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:24,530
Lulu, what do you think?

2146
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:24,890
Jake?

2147
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:27,710
Spider or Panther?

2148
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:29,590
I would just say Spider-Man.

2149
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,810
You wanna deal with Spider-Man or you wanna deal with Panther?

2150
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,930
I'd rather deal with Panther.

2151
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,190
Okay, just ban Spider.

2152
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:38,570
If anything, we can just go Loki.

2153
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:39,530
Ban Spider.

2154
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:40,910
Got it.

2155
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:46,850
I can... we could go Luna, Loki just to deal with Loki.

2156
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:47,930
I'm gonna run over their backline.

2157
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:54,030
Okay, I'll give you the orb.

2158
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:57,990
Three tanks is fine.

2159
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:59,330
Yeah, just run two tanks.

2160
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:00,010
It's fine.

2161
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:00,550
I'm done.

2162
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,910
We have burst heal and main heal.

2163
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,730
And if I ever die, my health can rest.

2164
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,330
Yeah, we have the revive.

2165
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,150
Wait, we have some crazy power ups.

2166
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:09,550
Alright, I'm done.

2167
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,610
Oh yeah, we do the triple hella thing.

2168
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,310
That's crazy.

2169
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:19,890
Alright, Surefour.

2170
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,410
Do what you do in rank.

2171
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,930
Not solo queue though, mentality.

2172
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:28,250
I always have the solo queue mentality.

2173
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:38,090
Alright, we're gonna have to deal with Black Panther.

2174
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,970
Oh, they protected Mag.

2175
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:41,910
I don't know why I thought he was bad.

2176
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:49,090
Yeah, if our backline is fucked, I can... we could also go Magneto thing.

2177
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:50,470
Like, I could Mag, you could thing.

2178
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,350
No, it's just... yeah, we could.

2179
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,890
But I want to try, like, not having a thing to see what it's like.

2180
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,490
Or I can always add.

2181
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:06,190
Oh, there you got Bucky.

2182
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:09,950
Yeah, they have Raccoon, triple healer.

2183
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:11,430
Oh, they have infinite.

2184
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:12,850
Yeah, they have infinite.

2185
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,050
Don't peek, don't peek.

2186
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:16,250
Oh yeah, they have infinite.

2187
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:17,590
Just play around the corner.

2188
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:23,370
Hugging, hugging.

2189
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:28,670
I got you.

2190
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:30,170
I can't move?

2191
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:30,570
What the heck?

2192
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:31,710
Wait, I'm... fuck.

2193
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:34,590
I'm stuck against the ridge of the roof?

2194
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:34,990
Okay.

2195
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,470
He's frozen, he's... oh, he was solo.

2196
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,150
I can bust, yeah.

2197
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,830
All good.

2198
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:43,470
Our teammates are respawning.

2199
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:46,290
Let me just... stabilize.

2200
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:47,550
Okay, I have no shield.

2201
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:48,150
Careful, careful.

2202
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:51,450
Oh, that hook lasted that long?

2203
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,130
We couldn't get to you there.

2204
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,350
Yeah, that character does that.

2205
01:26:58,510 --> 01:26:59,210
In fact, I'm out here.

2206
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:00,750
I'm running trip support, I'm going Hawkeye.

2207
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:05,370
Um, we could run trip support too.

2208
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,750
Just to counteract that.

2209
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,830
I don't play support, but like, fuck it.

2210
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,170
I mean, do you play Adam?

2211
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,950
Adam is basically a DPS support.

2212
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:17,430
I can Adam if... well, yeah, you can't.

2213
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:19,250
No, no, we need two tanks here.

2214
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:21,870
We can learn.

2215
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:29,510
Uh, Bucky's looking over the top right.

2216
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,280
Or you could go Bucky instead of trip support.

2217
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,140
I'll go first, I'll go first, I'll go first.

2218
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,520
Behind us, behind us.

2219
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,520
Mantis behind us.

2220
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:44,760
I got pulled.

2221
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,520
Oh, okay.

2222
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,060
Alright, you don't... I'll shield it.

2223
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,300
Yeah, shield, yeah, shield.

2224
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:49,740
Nice, okay.

2225
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,380
Yeah, I'm shielding.

2226
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,440
Got it.

2227
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,940
You don't... yeah.

2228
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,920
Do you play Bucky?

2229
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:58,840
Or no?

2230
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,820
Or is Hella your most comfortable pick?

2231
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,940
Uh, I mean, at this point, I could play anything.

2232
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,860
But, I mean, Bucky's pretty simple.

2233
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:07,580
I can play Bucky.

2234
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:12,280
Oh, I'm trying, I can't see you yet.

2235
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:13,780
Nah, I'm just dead.

2236
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,960
I'm slow to wake up.

2237
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,140
I didn't expect to be that far up.

2238
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:22,820
We have only one... we have only one, uh...

2239
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,360
We have like... oh, nice, nice.

2240
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,780
Just push up if you can.

2241
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,820
We have only one Contest here.

2242
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,480
Oh, I'm not Agumoto-ing this, actually.

2243
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,040
Thank you.

2244
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,080
We're on point.

2245
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:34,920
We're on point.

2246
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,700
Yeah, Agumoto after this.

2247
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,960
Copy me, copy me, copy me, copy me.

2248
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,980
He's getting fucking melted.

2249
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,580
I'm gonna have to Agumoto this.

2250
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,300
I see you, I see you, I see you, I see you.

2251
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:50,520
Doesn't matter.

2252
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,120
We still have Mag all here.

2253
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,340
I slept, I slept.

2254
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,100
I'm trying to help you.

2255
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,320
Nice.

2256
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:03,700
No more ults, no more ults.

2257
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:04,540
Loki's behind us.

2258
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:05,840
I froze him.

2259
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:06,720
Did he drop his shield?

2260
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,220
I think it broke.

2261
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:10,840
Yeah.

2262
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,970
Okay, if, uh...

2263
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:24,210
If the Bucky is too much for his again, we swap off Loki, because then it just gives him too much resets.

2264
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:27,110
Yeah.

2265
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,350
Uh, they're gonna have Mag ult too.

2266
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,110
I have ult here.

2267
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:32,230
Okay.

2268
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:36,090
Hugging, hugging.

2269
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,750
Oh, Coney.

2270
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:40,630
I'm trying to keep you up, Coney.

2271
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:41,830
Do you have bubble?

2272
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:42,330
Do you have...

2273
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:42,570
I have no shield.

2274
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:43,790
Stay in the ammo, stay in the ammo.

2275
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,980
We might need to swap off Loki just because of the Bucky, then.

2276
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,120
Because he gets too many resets for that.

2277
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:01,280
I'm back in the fight.

2278
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,700
Press G.

2279
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,340
Coney, Coney, back up in the spawn and G.

2280
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,980
Might be a good time to stop them.

2281
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,220
I feel like I'm being watched.

2282
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,060
Uh...

2283
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,780
They used both DPS ults.

2284
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,300
I gave...

2285
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,400
That's fine, I'm okay, I'm okay.

2286
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:24,820
He hooked a strange.

2287
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:25,820
I'm gonna die.

2288
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,320
Another hook.

2289
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,020
Got it.

2290
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:34,900
Nice.

2291
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,440
Hey, walk him down, walk him down.

2292
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,380
Uh, Maglo, Maglo.

2293
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,700
Punisher half.

2294
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,660
I can't help you there.

2295
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,140
I'm good.

2296
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,080
Careful of hooks.

2297
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:52,840
Nekroz is looking for hooks.

2298
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,960
Careful, we can't see you.

2299
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,020
Okay, only good player down.

2300
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,220
That was crazy.

2301
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,020
He's popping off, though.

2302
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,160
They should have...

2303
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,480
They have their DPS ults here, or like at least Punisher ult.

2304
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:13,900
You can look for Agumoto here.

2305
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,920
Yeah, try and get one of the support ults out of the way.

2306
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:19,980
Nice, nice.

2307
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,260
Mantis behind us.

2308
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:24,100
Oh, I got pushed out.

2309
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,540
I got you.

2310
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:25,900
NT, NT.

2311
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,560
Aisle first, aisle first.

2312
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:29,260
Bring shield, Mag.

2313
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:29,920
Okay.

2314
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,300
Aisle first, aisle first.

2315
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,380
Yeah, yeah, shield.

2316
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,380
Use your shield, use your shield.

2317
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:38,580
Yeah, yeah.

2318
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,300
Nice.

2319
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,480
We are undefeatable.

2320
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,600
3, 2, 1.

2321
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,420
Backing out.

2322
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,320
Nekroz is on me.

2323
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,300
Nekroz is on...

2324
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,120
That's good.

2325
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:55,900
You guys are even.

2326
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,680
Oh, now you're down one.

2327
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:02,880
Nice, you're even again.

2328
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,260
Trevor, if you look at me.

2329
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,240
I'm coming back.

2330
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:10,420
No!

2331
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,020
Uh-oh.

2332
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,300
I'm gonna need help.

2333
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,200
I'm trying to help you.

2334
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:16,700
Got you.

2335
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:17,560
Thank you.

2336
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:19,960
I froze Mag.

2337
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:20,860
I froze Mag behind you.

2338
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,880
I froze Mag behind you.

2339
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,860
Mag is right behind you.

2340
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,100
I don't have...

2341
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:26,840
Can I be on our left?

2342
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,420
Yeah, I don't have anything for it.

2343
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,580
I got Mantis.

2344
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,420
I couldn't.

2345
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,740
I was way too...

2346
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:34,680
We have to reset.

2347
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:35,140
Oh, wait.

2348
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:35,300
Nice.

2349
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,760
You're down one, though.

2350
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,300
You're down two.

2351
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:40,500
No tanks.

2352
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,180
You have no tanks.

2353
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,520
So, be careful.

2354
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:43,220
We can focus...

2355
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,560
Their Bucky walks up a lot.

2356
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,220
Like, we can focus him when he does that.

2357
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,010
I don't have ult here.

2358
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:54,950
Turret's one.

2359
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,050
I'm low, though.

2360
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:57,390
Can you see me?

2361
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:58,150
I'm backing up.

2362
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,050
Use it the moment you get it.

2363
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:01,010
Use it the moment you get it.

2364
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:03,610
Honking it.

2365
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:04,670
Almost have Agamotto.

2366
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:06,290
Still use it?

2367
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,270
No, no, no.

2368
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:07,670
Don't use it.

2369
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:07,950
Don't use it.

2370
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,290
Don't use it.

2371
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:08,670
Don't use it.

2372
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,050
We're fine.

2373
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:09,330
He's hooking.

2374
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:09,830
He's still hooking.

2375
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:10,210
He's stabilized.

2376
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,540
They're gonna punish ult here.

2377
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:24,620
Fucking turret on the left there.

2378
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:25,340
That lasted.

2379
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,190
Care hook.

2380
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:30,450
Care hook.

2381
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,050
All right.

2382
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:32,390
Blocked it.

2383
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:33,450
Use it here.

2384
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:33,830
Use it here.

2385
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:34,230
Use it here.

2386
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:35,030
Use it here.

2387
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:35,830
I'm trying.

2388
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:36,070
I'm trying.

2389
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,350
You have shield.

2390
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:38,690
Shield her.

2391
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:38,970
Shield her.

2392
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:39,230
Shield her.

2393
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:41,570
I almost got in there.

2394
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:43,070
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2395
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:46,710
This is last fight.

2396
01:33:46,770 --> 01:33:47,370
This is last fight.

2397
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:47,810
Nice.

2398
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:48,910
Damage boosting.

2399
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,290
One of us is dying, Nekros.

2400
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,710
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

2401
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:58,890
They're portaling.

2402
01:33:59,070 --> 01:33:59,670
It's fine, it's fine.

2403
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,410
They can touch.

2404
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:01,810
They can touch.

2405
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,950
Come here, Rekku.

2406
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:07,270
Rekku's low.

2407
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,360
There's a bubble down.

2408
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:16,580
I couldn't.

2409
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:19,060
I couldn't get in there.

2410
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:20,980
What?

2411
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,580
Oh, I'm dead as fuck.

2412
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,740
I don't know if we could contest this.

2413
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,260
Is that touchable?

2414
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,140
No, it's not.

2415
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:27,960
No, no, no.

2416
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,200
I mean, honestly, good ult on that.

2417
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,360
Dude, winnable.

2418
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,000
Actually winnable.

2419
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:35,720
We win this.

2420
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:49,910
Yeah, sorry.

2421
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:52,010
I should have said keep the mag bubble.

2422
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:53,550
It's very close to ult that.

2423
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:55,230
I had it in one.

2424
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,930
Yeah, that was unlucky.

2425
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,270
It was just about to come up.

2426
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:12,300
It's alright.

2427
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:12,820
It's winnable.

2428
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:14,460
We can cap this, I think.

2429
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:17,940
Same shit.

2430
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,380
I'll keep the snowflake on you for sure for it.

2431
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:25,180
And then I'll swap it to tank and let you know.

2432
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:26,460
Aight.

2433
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:46,950
How's the Bucky doing, by the way?

2434
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:47,830
Oh yeah, um...

2435
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:49,210
Are you comfortable with it or do you want to go something else?

2436
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:52,370
Uh, I mean, I'm definitely learning Lmao, but...

2437
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:53,050
Oh, then just snipe.

2438
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:53,810
Just play snipe for now.

2439
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:54,850
Or do we not need one?

2440
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:56,010
I mean, I could just play hello.

2441
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:58,570
You can play hello on this attack.

2442
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:59,810
Yeah, just play whatever you want.

2443
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:00,890
Play hello on the attack.

2444
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:05,330
Kony, let me know when you're ulting so I can damage boost it.

2445
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:06,290
Sure.

2446
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:08,270
Turret's top right.

2447
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:08,630
Careful.

2448
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:09,750
I'm LOSing.

2449
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,580
I'm shooting turret.

2450
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:18,900
Turret down.

2451
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:23,920
Infinite Amp real careful.

2452
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:24,940
Yeah, don't peek that.

2453
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,520
Don't peek that.

2454
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:26,880
Wait until the Infinite's gone.

2455
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,840
Somebody up here.

2456
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,460
The Nectar's on, uh, they're on Psylocke.

2457
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:35,240
They don't have a hook.

2458
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:37,900
Focus on Tink.

2459
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:38,360
Focus Tink.

2460
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:39,040
Oh, he's one.

2461
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:39,280
He's one.

2462
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:39,780
Nice, nice, nice.

2463
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,800
They're gonna have, uh, they're gonna have...

2464
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,300
Psylocke on us in the back.

2465
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:43,560
Psylocke in the back.

2466
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,040
Yeah, I'm trying to help you.

2467
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:47,980
There's still Psylocke behind us.

2468
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,860
Psylocke's still behind us.

2469
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:50,560
I'm asleep.

2470
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,140
I'm asleep.

2471
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:51,560
I'm dying.

2472
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:00,510
Uh oh.

2473
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,750
Uh oh.

2474
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,850
You're behind them.

2475
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,950
Uh oh.

2476
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,550
Are you gonna live?

2477
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:09,350
No, I'm not gonna live, but I'm trying to get one while I'm going down.

2478
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:10,370
Portal out.

2479
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:11,090
Portal out.

2480
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:12,130
Oh, nice.

2481
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:12,810
Nice, nice, nice.

2482
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:13,130
That's huge.

2483
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:13,450
That's huge.

2484
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,090
I got one.

2485
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:14,610
I got one.

2486
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:20,910
They're on Panther, by the way.

2487
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:21,350
Big kill.

2488
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,090
I'm walking him down.

2489
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:24,310
I'm not stopping till he dies or I die.

2490
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:25,330
No, I'm kidding, but...

2491
01:37:26,610 --> 01:37:27,650
I'll push up then.

2492
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:30,490
We're on Panther, but I froze him.

2493
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:30,950
I froze him.

2494
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:31,330
I froze him.

2495
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:31,710
I'm going back.

2496
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:32,230
I'm going back.

2497
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:34,650
Psylocke didn't last very long.

2498
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,230
Oh, okay.

2499
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:36,650
I'm ulting.

2500
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:39,630
Pushing up.

2501
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:40,130
What is that?

2502
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:46,330
Three, two, one.

2503
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:48,950
You want me to ult in, too?

2504
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:50,190
No, keep as a defense.

2505
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,050
We need to keep as a defense.

2506
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:52,710
I got you.

2507
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:55,690
I got slapped.

2508
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:59,690
No, you got slapped the moment the Panther died.

2509
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,470
That was crazy.

2510
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:03,790
I tried to save you, too.

2511
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:10,510
Okay, I'm going to go low-key because of this Panther.

2512
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:13,410
Yeah, good call.

2513
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:19,090
I got Moto.

2514
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,930
I'm just going to get fucking pushed, though.

2515
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:24,250
Try to see if they use it.

2516
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:27,970
Turret.

2517
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:31,470
Panther on us.

2518
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:32,170
I'm inmo.

2519
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:33,430
Inmo's gone.

2520
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:33,990
Inmo's gone.

2521
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,210
I'm trying to keep you up, though.

2522
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:37,530
Nice, nice.

2523
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:40,330
Panther's still behind us, by the way.

2524
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:47,250
I'm trying to do my best to keep you guys up.

2525
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,030
Nice kill.

2526
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:52,630
No, I was right behind.

2527
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:54,370
It hit the shield, but it...

2528
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:56,450
Yeah, it was just that splash damage.

2529
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:02,010
Oh, I can't play Adam because I don't have enough heals for Adam.

2530
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,460
I can let Coney solo tank.

2531
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:10,140
Come on.

2532
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,920
I mean, we could try.

2533
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,320
It's all about trying now.

2534
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:26,100
We're all about trying whatever we want.

2535
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,060
Nah, I'm fine.

2536
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:29,120
I'm a strange man.

2537
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,840
I'm ulting this, then.

2538
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,080
Behind us, behind us.

2539
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,220
He's low.

2540
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,040
You're a slippery motherfucker, that guy.

2541
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:56,740
They're behind us, top right.

2542
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:03,600
At best, I have immo for him, but like, that's all I can...

2543
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,160
Winnable.

2544
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:07,460
Winnable.

2545
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:09,120
Still winnable!

2546
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,280
You have to ult, you can ult.

2547
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,460
Rookie, rookie.

2548
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:18,080
There's the Panther.

2549
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,580
Panther's still on point.

2550
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,280
Panther is still alive.

2551
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,040
Jeez.

2552
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,420
I don't have immo.

2553
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:29,840
NT.

2554
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:36,500
Warm up.

2555
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,660
Nice try, nice try, nice try.

2556
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,170
Nice try.

2557
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:52,590
Nice try, nice try.

2558
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:56,750
Still warm up.

2559
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:10,300
It's alright, we're just trying to let people play what they're comfortable with in the end.

2560
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:17,980
I think, like, only Shurifor and I are the flexers that can play whatever support or DPS is needed of us.

2561
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,280
Yeah, it's just...

2562
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,160
Should've unleashed the Widow.

2563
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:29,740
Yeah, I don't know.

2564
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,080
Uh...

2565
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:32,800
Uh...

2566
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,180
I'm just trying to just play whatever they're comfortable with.

2567
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,360
That's why I was like, I'll just play Lil' T.

2568
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,540
Alright.

2569
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:43,440
Alright, cool.

2570
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:46,640
Who's our next matchup we're playing against?

2571
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,240
Playing against Sleepy's team.

2572
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,700
Um, we have...

2573
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,240
I'm gonna play some ranked after this game.

2574
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,200
Just to, I guess, feel a little bit better.

2575
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,440
Uh, we have three more rounds left.

2576
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:04,860
Wait,

2577
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:09,890
so why is your name Wide Among Us?

2578
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:12,730
Uh, Wide Among Us Gay Sex.

2579
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:13,730
Oh.

2580
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:16,170
I know that emote.

2581
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:17,070
Yeah.

2582
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:18,010
Okay.

2583
01:42:18,390 --> 01:42:19,730
That's what the name's based off of.

2584
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:21,250
Alright.

2585
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:23,090
Good to know.

2586
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:24,530
Why didn't you get the second part?

2587
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:24,930
It didn't fit?

2588
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:26,550
Yeah, it didn't fit.

2589
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:28,450
And I don't think they would let that.

2590
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:31,710
Oh.

2591
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,010
China.

2592
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:36,010
What the fuck?

2593
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:37,230
You have so many hours on Thor.

2594
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,590
Oh, this is my Thor account.

2595
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,430
I got the top 25.

2596
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:45,450
Yeah, I was gonna say, isn't that the account you got top 25 solo queue?

2597
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:46,610
Jesus.

2598
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:49,370
Wait, we can let you Thor.

2599
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:51,350
Mmm...

2600
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:53,350
We can run 3-3.

2601
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:54,250
It's...

2602
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:54,970
Try 1-2.

2603
01:42:54,970 --> 01:43:00,910
I think if I play Thor against triple support, it wouldn't be that good.

2604
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:04,710
Because at least when I'm Hawkeye, I can just one-shot the healers.

2605
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:05,570
Yeah, that's true.

2606
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:07,630
Yeah.

2607
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:10,650
We could run 3-1-2 as well.

2608
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:16,690
But, oh wait, actually, we can't because you're the other... you're the third tank player.

2609
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:17,150
I mean, or 2 -1 -3, I could like...

2610
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:20,930
You're technically the third tank player.

2611
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:28,980
Honestly, just run... just play whatever you guys are most comfortable with.

2612
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,800
I'm just playing whatever I think will be good in the moment.

2613
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:33,580
Yeah.

2614
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:37,700
I think, like, for the rest of us, just play, like, your most comfortable picks.

2615
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,720
And if you wanna swap, just swap.

2616
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:40,960
At this point.

2617
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:45,060
If you wanna swap and you feel like swapping is the key, just swap.

2618
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,020
I'm just trying to go in.

2619
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:53,680
I think we get freaky.

2620
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:55,060
I'm just gonna go in.

2621
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:55,680
Widowmantus?

2622
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:56,360
We just get...

2623
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,160
I think we do Widowmantus.

2624
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,380
There were some teams that did scrim.

2625
01:43:58,620 --> 01:43:59,800
There were teams that did scrim.

2626
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:00,120
I think...

2627
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,180
Because they took it really seriously.

2628
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:01,920
Yeah.

2629
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:02,840
Widowmantus.

2630
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:03,300
I was tired of scrimming.

2631
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,880
And then I'll go Strange, and then we walk them down.

2632
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,640
And everybody seemed really...

2633
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,960
Also, like, it always seemed really busy, and we had a last-minute substitute too.

2634
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,140
I don't know.

2635
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,320
I feel like we need to...

2636
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,300
I don't know what I need to comm, but, like, they've been out of position a lot.

2637
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:19,820
Like, on Strange, I just solo killed their fucking Invis woman, and then solo killed their Raccoon.

2638
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,160
Because they're just, like, walking...

2639
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,400
Because it's like...

2640
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,320
There's, like, top 500 players, and there's, like, Diamond players.

2641
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,740
So, it's like...

2642
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:28,020
Some of them are just, like, walking into, like, a corridor.

2643
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:29,900
Yeah, it's a mix of everything.

2644
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:30,580
Yeah.

2645
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,240
And they don't respect us.

2646
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,800
I mean, they don't have to, clearly, but, like...

2647
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,180
We have to make them respect us.

2648
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:40,580
Exactly.

2649
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:46,420
Make them respect us.

2650
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:47,980
Lay it all out on the table.

2651
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:51,580
I'll break the toast...

2652
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:54,080
I think I have a curse with any toast tournament.

2653
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,440
Any toast tournament I participate in, I'm, like...

2654
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,500
Except for the first one.

2655
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:06,740
The very first Disguised Toast tournament I did, it was alright.

2656
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,220
We got first place.

2657
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,320
And then, like, it's just...

2658
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:11,980
I peaked.

2659
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:15,360
I peaked, and then, like...

2660
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,440
And then everything went downhill.

2661
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:22,300
I peaked at the first tournament, and then nothing was the same since.

2662
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:29,620
And then...

2663
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:32,060
Yeah.

2664
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,200
I peaked at first try.

2665
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:35,600
It's alright.

2666
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:40,200
Like I said, I knew going in, I knew going in, because, like...

2667
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:42,460
It was also, like...

2668
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:44,480
We literally got our last minute substitute at...

2669
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,700
10pm last night.

2670
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,040
Like...

2671
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,480
Our last minute sub was...

2672
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,600
Was brought in at 10pm.

2673
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:56,920
Because we were mess...

2674
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,580
Like, everybody was messaging people.

2675
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,960
Just to figure out, like...

2676
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,660
Like, who we have to get.

2677
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,420
And I think, like...

2678
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,460
I think, like...

2679
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,730
I think Jake is, like, the only Diamond player to...

2680
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,700
In the entire, like...

2681
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,140
In the tournament that's currently Diamond.

2682
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,120
I don't know.

2683
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:16,820
I don't remember if I saw on some of the teams that anyone else is Diamond.

2684
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:18,180
But...

2685
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,020
Because it was, like, Diamond to GM.

2686
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,540
And I was going to get...

2687
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:25,000
I messaged someone that I thought was GM, but they recently hit Celestial.

2688
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:26,700
Celestial 3.

2689
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,440
They recently hit Celestial 3.

2690
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,760
And then...

2691
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,240
Toast was like, sorry we can't get him.

2692
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,160
Because we can't let Celestial 3 be in the Diamond GM spot.

2693
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:36,280
And I was like, that's cool.

2694
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:36,880
That's alright.

2695
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:39,820
And...

2696
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,040
And then, so, like...

2697
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,160
Because, like, you know...

2698
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,400
We couldn't make it today.

2699
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,760
So we were like, alright.

2700
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,300
We just grab anyone.

2701
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,480
We just gotta grab somebody.

2702
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:58,220
We gotta grab someone.

2703
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:02,500
So he's, like, filling in for us really last minute.

2704
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,920
But yeah.

2705
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,260
And it's fine.

2706
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:13,440
Like, I went going in knowing that it was a Conqueror team.

2707
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:16,000
And teams in Conqueror teams are never actually...

2708
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,240
They can never be fully balanced, you know?

2709
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,040
And then, obviously, we didn't scrim.

2710
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,120
So we didn't figure out, like, what we're comfortable with.

2711
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,780
Which is my bad.

2712
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:29,240
Because I could have asked if people would want to scrim.

2713
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,340
But even if we did scrim, we would have lost Wig.

2714
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:34,160
We would have lost Wig.

2715
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:35,860
And then we were like, what do we do?

2716
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:42,820
How are the motivational speeches going?

2717
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:44,220
Wait, how do you know?

2718
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,360
I just assumed that's what you were doing.

2719
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,460
Because it's what you did last time.

2720
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,140
I'm listening to Denzel Washington.

2721
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,380
He's pepping me up.

2722
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:51,180
Is it working?

2723
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:52,720
I'm hyped.

2724
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:53,720
I just did 10 push-ups.

2725
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:54,900
Because DJ Khaled told me to.

2726
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,000
Wait, do 20.

2727
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,960
I'll do another 10 right now.

2728
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,740
No, 20 in a row.

2729
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,500
What's your max?

2730
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,540
Do your max right now.

2731
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,100
I don't know.

2732
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,680
I do incline.

2733
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:04,660
That's fine.

2734
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:05,620
That's fine.

2735
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:05,820
Okay.

2736
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:06,680
I'll do 20.

2737
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:11,100
I don't think he's actually doing it.

2738
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,280
Okay, now do some burpees.

2739
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,000
I don't think he's actually doing it.

2740
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:14,540
There's no way.

2741
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,080
I am!

2742
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:15,760
I don't think so.

2743
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:16,800
Do some burpees.

2744
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,360
Turn the cam on.

2745
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,900
Turn the cam on and do it.

2746
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,360
What's a burpee?

2747
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,360
A burpee is where you do a jumping jack.

2748
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,040
You jump up in the air and then you do a push-up.

2749
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,740
Okay, I'm not doing that.

2750
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,140
Oh, the game is supposed to start in a minute.

2751
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,180
Are we all here?

2752
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,120
I'm here.

2753
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,160
Sleepy is supposed to invite me.

2754
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,120
When we're playing on Sleepy, I fucking hate that guy.

2755
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:43,600
Wait, why do you hate that guy?

2756
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,620
Because he's cute.

2757
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:47,660
I mean, we can just ban Loki.

2758
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:48,880
You hate people because they're cute?

2759
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,320
I get jealous.

2760
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,080
Sleepy fucking invite me.

2761
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:57,180
Wait, can you look me up and say if you hate me then?

2762
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:58,920
He's like, I love you.

2763
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:04,260
I saw your picture in our team thing.

2764
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:04,800
You're kind of cute.

2765
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:06,520
So you hate me?

2766
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:08,000
Yeah, well, like...

2767
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,180
A little bit.

2768
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,440
Like, I'm from Overwatch.

2769
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,900
I'm not cute enough to be hated?

2770
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,520
What the fuck?

2771
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:16,660
It's different!

2772
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,900
What do you mean it's different?

2773
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,260
Because Sleepy is like, oh yeah, I'm a catboy.

2774
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,180
It's different.

2775
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:24,280
No, he's a femboy.

2776
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:25,000
Get it right.

2777
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:26,920
And a catboy.

2778
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:27,500
It's both.

2779
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,480
Dude, his RuneScape name is like Catboy.

2780
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,580
Just say I'm ugly.

2781
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:36,140
I get it.

2782
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,800
You're beautiful, bro.

2783
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,520
It's just a different... I wasn't filled with rage, but now I am.

2784
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,140
This game is invite only.

2785
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,080
That's fucked up.

2786
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,700
Use the rage to win.

2787
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:51,440
I will do.

2788
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:52,220
I just got motivated.

2789
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:53,460
That's good.

2790
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,020
I pulled out the motivational speech.

2791
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,000
I lost like 50 viewers.

2792
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:04,080
I'm nice in that fucking game.

2793
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:09,900
Who are you missing?

2794
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:12,280
Oh, wait.

2795
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,980
Let me see.

2796
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:14,760
Where are you?

2797
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,460
Wait, didn't I have you on my friends list?

2798
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,980
Who was invited in Lulu?

2799
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:19,820
It wasn't me.

2800
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:24,220
I joined off Bogr the first time.

2801
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:27,080
Oh yeah, the first time.

2802
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,000
We're getting spectated.

2803
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:39,320
I don't know their team.

2804
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,520
I just know Void plays Magneto.

2805
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:44,220
Fear, Magneto.

2806
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:12,920
Yeah, whatever.

2807
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:14,480
I feel like these guys are respectable.

2808
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,800
They probably play Hitscan.

2809
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:16,620
Do you think they play Namor?

2810
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:17,420
Maybe.

2811
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,240
Bangchan fan?

2812
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:22,840
Namor is one of the easiest characters to play.

2813
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,940
I was like, who the fuck is Bangchan?

2814
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,720
Oh yeah, is that Peter?

2815
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,520
Peter plays...

2816
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,140
I know Peter.

2817
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,580
Actually, I don't know.

2818
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:34,360
I didn't have Peter last time in the toast thing.

2819
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,600
Isn't Peter bald now?

2820
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:37,580
Yo.

2821
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,340
No, I saw the Twitter post.

2822
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:41,580
He shaved his head?

2823
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:42,300
Yeah.

2824
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,540
Wait, I don't even use Twitter anymore.

2825
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,120
Let me see.

2826
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:49,860
Are you for real?

2827
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,900
Holy fuck, he did shave his head.

2828
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,120
And it's not even like a clean shave.

2829
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:55,680
What the hell?

2830
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,220
Wait, why is this one Oregon?

2831
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:58,860
Is that normal?

2832
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,440
I mean, that's fine for you guys, I think.

2833
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,760
I'm eastbound here.

2834
01:52:08,110 --> 01:52:08,770
Look at this.

2835
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:16,700
Are y'all ready?

2836
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,680
I don't know if we're all ready or not.

2837
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:19,620
Yeah.

2838
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:20,620
Are y'all here?

2839
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:22,700
I'm back.

2840
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,420
You sound so fucking depressed.

2841
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,040
I'm ready.

2842
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:26,780
What do you mean?

2843
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:27,700
I'm good to go.

2844
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:27,920
I'm here.

2845
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,760
That sounded so depressing.

2846
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:30,920
We're down three stocks.

2847
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:32,600
This guy is already jumping off the map.

2848
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:36,680
He's like, he's feeling...

2849
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,240
I'm ready.

2850
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:40,060
He's feeling PTSD from Smash Bros right now.

2851
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:43,120
Oh wait, I'm not doing bans, am I?

2852
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,040
Am I the team guy?

2853
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:46,000
It's whoever is in the faction.

2854
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,640
I don't even know that.

2855
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,000
Remember when Leshota was always the one doing bans there?

2856
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,680
Right, yeah.

2857
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:58,100
We are... I assume everybody's here.

2858
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:00,660
I'm just gonna... If we're not, then that's okay.

2859
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,320
We have the whole ban phase for people to get back.

2860
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:12,960
But what if the person banning is gone?

2861
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,960
Then we'll jump then, I guess.

2862
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,520
Fuck us.

2863
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:18,560
Can we ask for a reset?

2864
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,480
No, we go in with no bans.

2865
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:23,460
Let's make it quick play.

2866
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:25,080
I'm not afraid.

2867
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,020
We were doing this map again?

2868
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:30,940
Oh, we are.

2869
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,540
The whole club was looking at her.

2870
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:35,520
Dude, that's crazy.

2871
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:38,140
This one's domination, so we're not...

2872
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:39,720
Oh yeah, it's domination, yeah.

2873
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,800
I was like, what?

2874
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,340
This again?

2875
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:44,600
So who banned first?

2876
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:48,300
Glorp, ban, ban...

2877
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,200
Fuck Snoopy, ban Loki.

2878
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:51,560
Fuck him.

2879
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,900
Us against the world.

2880
01:53:56,740 --> 01:54:01,200
I don't want him to play the game that he wants to play.

2881
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:02,120
What the Glorp?

2882
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,300
Why'd they ban Hawkeye?

2883
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:07,180
I guess I don't want a new one-shot.

2884
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,940
Were they watching my last game?

2885
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:16,280
I mean, Hawkeye is always good against teams that are SR around the place.

2886
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:21,280
Alright, who wants their character protected?

2887
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,320
Who wants to protect their character?

2888
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:25,820
IDK.

2889
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,000
We protect Widow.

2890
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:29,120
Yo, I'm down.

2891
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:35,460
Let's fucking throw.

2892
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:36,880
Up to you guys, let me know.

2893
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,320
There's no way they banned Hawkeye and Widow.

2894
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,760
That'd be insane.

2895
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,340
I mean, we could protect Strange.

2896
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,700
Yeah, Strange is fine.

2897
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,900
I was gonna do Widow, I honestly don't care.

2898
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,860
Dude, play Widow, play whatever you want.

2899
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:52,200
Just play whatever you want, guys.

2900
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,820
Something will work out.

2901
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:59,340
Something nice will happen.

2902
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:00,320
Should we ban Nemore?

2903
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,000
Yeah, just ban Nemore.

2904
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:06,640
I don't want to play against Nemore anyway.

2905
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,620
Real talk, no bans.

2906
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:09,360
Just play.

2907
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,960
We just did all two.

2908
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:18,640
Wait, what if I go Iron Fist?

2909
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:20,500
Oh, fuck, let's do it.

2910
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:23,060
Just do it, it's Mr. Heroes.

2911
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:24,500
Cheaper town hall!

2912
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,440
Oh, nevermind.

2913
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,000
I don't get my thing.

2914
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:27,820
Okay, cool.

2915
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:29,880
Why did we ban Luna?

2916
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:30,700
We already banned...

2917
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:31,900
I guess they don't want defensive.

2918
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:32,460
Okay.

2919
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:34,140
Protect Strange, lock Magneto.

2920
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,500
Yeah, fuck this.

2921
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,020
I'm done.

2922
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:44,880
Holy!

2923
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:45,560
Run it.

2924
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:47,100
They're all lords!

2925
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:49,120
Run it.

2926
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:51,440
I only have Ward.

2927
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,520
If it doesn't work, I'm just selfless.

2928
01:55:58,460 --> 01:55:59,960
This is definitely not enough.

2929
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,160
Okay, I can't play Mantis.

2930
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:03,040
Wait, we can do Mantis-Atom thoughts?

2931
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:04,060
Yeah, we can.

2932
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:05,000
Do you want to go Magneto?

2933
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:05,860
I mean, I don't really...

2934
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,980
We go Mantis-Atom, we need triple support.

2935
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:13,940
Yeah, we need triple support.

2936
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:14,920
Yeah, no, I like this, I like this.

2937
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:16,200
Alright, fuck it!

2938
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:17,600
Fuck it, ball up.

2939
01:56:17,620 --> 01:56:18,180
Fuck it, let's ball!

2940
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,720
Oh my god, all the DPS.

2941
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:21,260
Let's fucking ball!

2942
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,400
Yo, hit them shots!

2943
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:25,400
It's West Coast now, so I'm lagging, you're good.

2944
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:25,960
Okay.

2945
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:27,300
Wait, it's West Coast?

2946
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:30,140
It should automatically be Virginia.

2947
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:31,460
I'm 75 ping, brother.

2948
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:32,120
Wait, what the fuck?

2949
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:33,940
Okay, whatever, it doesn't matter.

2950
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:35,020
Fuck it, ball up.

2951
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,700
Yeah, let's ball it, I don't care anymore.

2952
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,980
Restart the lobby.

2953
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:40,920
Plus $1,000.

2954
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,340
It's okay, we don't have EU players, it's okay.

2955
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:46,440
If we lose the game, we can blame it, we're like, yo, we're EU.

2956
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,500
What the fuck?

2957
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,060
I'll never say I'm EU.

2958
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,520
Where are they?

2959
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,160
Port me, portal me.

2960
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:00,860
We're running triple support with, I think...

2961
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:02,960
They have Atom.

2962
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,160
Not Atom, uh...

2963
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:05,800
Oh, they do have Atom, but Starlord too.

2964
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:12,680
Hey, look, ping!

2965
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:14,680
Let's contest point here.

2966
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,680
Nice, we got ping.

2967
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,140
You're not going to die, you're not going to die.

2968
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:21,420
Where's my Widow?

2969
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:22,400
Okay, there he is.

2970
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,060
Yo, Starlord, Starlord, Starlord!

2971
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,320
There's so many things going on on my screen.

2972
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:30,340
I have my ult.

2973
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,680
I mean, we could...

2974
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:33,800
We could get a pick.

2975
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:36,720
I'm on it.

2976
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,920
I'm already told.

2977
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:47,060
Yeah, no, I mean...

2978
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:48,760
Haha, we were on triple support.

2979
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,260
We farmed that fast.

2980
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,980
No, we got a bubble!

2981
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,120
Restart, restart, restart.

2982
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:57,760
Let's just use...

2983
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,380
I guess we'll use support as defensive.

2984
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:03,000
All right, Strange, here's day three.

2985
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:05,840
Um, there's three as well.

2986
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:07,920
So it doesn't...

2987
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,780
It's better to...

2988
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,440
Get damage boosted.

2989
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:23,980
We're all here.

2990
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:25,140
Same push up.

2991
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:25,780
Moving up.

2992
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:30,140
Oh, Coney, you are taking so much damage.

2993
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:31,240
Yeah, I can't, I can't...

2994
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:32,420
Oh, I just got sedated!

2995
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:33,000
I'll swap, but...

2996
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,300
I'll swap to mag, because I can't...

2997
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:35,920
I got my ult.

2998
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,060
Just walking up to them.

2999
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:38,200
Yeah.

3000
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:43,010
They're low!

3001
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:46,230
Oh, she got it off!

3002
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:49,650
All right, she got the Riz off, though.

3003
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:51,830
I don't know where the Riz is.

3004
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:58,470
Damn, that bubble, man.

3005
01:58:58,470 --> 01:58:59,490
I can't heal you there.

3006
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:03,490
Nice, Riz.

3007
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:09,070
Nice.

3008
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:11,410
We got bubbled.

3009
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:13,210
Manta?

3010
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:13,670
No.

3011
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:15,790
It's all healing, but...

3012
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,510
Back up!

3013
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:18,290
Oh...

3014
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:20,370
We don't have defensive for it, other than...

3015
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:21,350
I mean, we got nice soulbond.

3016
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:22,070
That's a good soulbond.

3017
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:24,790
Holy shit.

3018
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:25,770
Nice.

3019
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:27,150
Got him.

3020
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:27,970
Hey, W kills!

3021
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:28,510
W kills!

3022
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:32,150
Okay...

3023
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:33,150
They're gonna have...

3024
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,590
They're gonna mag ult here.

3025
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:49,900
I got ult.

3026
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:52,640
I don't have ult yet.

3027
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:53,520
Okay, double time.

3028
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:56,140
Careful, Coney.

3029
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:57,580
Careful, Coney, you're one!

3030
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:58,580
Ah, my god.

3031
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,420
Try to jump back.

3032
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:02,080
If you can, give me...

3033
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,100
Okay, I have to use this.

3034
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:04,140
I missed him though.

3035
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:04,300
Oh.

3036
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:07,380
They're gonna...

3037
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:08,380
They're gonna thing ult after.

3038
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:12,940
Oh, nice cancel.

3039
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:14,080
Do I stay clobbering?

3040
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,060
Someone has to...

3041
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:15,920
Someone has to touch point!

3042
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:16,980
Someone has to touch point!

3043
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:18,100
One of the tanks has to touch!

3044
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:19,260
Oh.

3045
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:22,400
I can run up without him.

3046
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:26,830
You're fine, you're fine.

3047
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:27,610
Look, look, Starlord!

3048
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:31,920
He's like half.

3049
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,660
We are undefeatable!

3050
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:38,100
Oh, that's three ults.

3051
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:40,560
That's three fucking ults.

3052
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,140
That's fucking crazy.

3053
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,600
I should have rez, but fuck it.

3054
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:49,300
Yeah, I'll split to mag.

3055
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:49,700
I just...

3056
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:52,140
I had ult, so I was trying to save it, but...

3057
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:55,040
Yeah, I can't solo tank on thing, because I just get exploded.

3058
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:56,980
Yeah.

3059
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:58,340
I'll swap.

3060
02:00:59,120 --> 02:00:59,640
No, yeah.

3061
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:01,940
Thing solo tank is like...

3062
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:03,760
definitely the hardest to play.

3063
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:06,520
I mean...

3064
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,020
Can I strange here?

3065
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:07,880
I think we should lock him down.

3066
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:08,620
Yeah, no.

3067
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,820
I'm just going to swap to another support then.

3068
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:12,580
Because they only had...

3069
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:13,280
What was their damage?

3070
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:13,800
Was it Starlord?

3071
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:15,540
It was Starlord, yeah.

3072
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:16,760
Starlord and thing.

3073
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:22,780
You just have to swap off Widow, because Widow is not good with Elementals.

3074
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:23,820
Yeah.

3075
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:35,480
I have point flip so often.

3076
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:38,940
Like, we have to make sure at least one tank stays on point.

3077
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,540
Even if you think you're going to die, it's better to just stay on point.

3078
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:43,900
Last game, we didn't have a tank up.

3079
02:01:44,220 --> 02:01:44,480
Yeah.

3080
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:47,800
Because I was dead and coming back, and we didn't have another tank to touch point.

3081
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:48,760
Oh, yeah.

3082
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:49,040
You were...

3083
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:49,360
Oh, yeah.

3084
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:50,380
We were one tank, dude.

3085
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,080
That's why we didn't get it last time.

3086
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,140
Do you want to drop?

3087
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:11,340
Starlord is on my left side.

3088
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:12,400
I'm going to drop.

3089
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:13,700
Okay.

3090
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:15,540
I'm looking back.

3091
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:22,080
Hey, what's happening?

3092
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,920
They're all just running at us.

3093
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:24,160
They're on top of us.

3094
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:24,580
They're all just running.

3095
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,300
I got slapped.

3096
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:31,220
They just, like, ran at us.

3097
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,320
There was nothing we could do there.

3098
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:48,150
They're going to have Tingle here.

3099
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:54,190
Nice.

3100
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:57,250
I guess I'll ult first.

3101
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:58,990
Whenever...

3102
02:02:58,990 --> 02:02:59,790
Yeah.

3103
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:04,000
They're going to have Tingle.

3104
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:05,480
I pulled back, but...

3105
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:06,640
Careful of Tingle.

3106
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,680
I'm off guard here.

3107
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:15,770
Hey, can we walk up?

3108
02:03:16,410 --> 02:03:17,850
Give this fucking Starlord ult.

3109
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:19,290
I'm walking up.

3110
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,890
I'm going to look for Agumon.

3111
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:22,970
I don't have ult for that.

3112
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,570
I ult.

3113
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:24,310
My ult is on point.

3114
02:03:25,050 --> 02:03:25,830
I got you.

3115
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:27,730
Oh, he went push for us.

3116
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:30,190
What's up, Papa?

3117
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:31,290
I was a little lucky.

3118
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:35,130
Get this Mag.

3119
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:40,050
You only have local kills there.

3120
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:40,850
You're down.

3121
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:41,930
Oh, wait, they rez.

3122
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,580
They still have Mag ult.

3123
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:53,960
Unless they use it.

3124
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:54,320
One portal.

3125
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:57,840
Can we portal?

3126
02:03:58,060 --> 02:03:59,460
You have to portal now.

3127
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:00,700
You have to portal now if you want to.

3128
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:01,700
Back up, back up, back up.

3129
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,400
Oh, we got protected.

3130
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:04,320
Let me know if he's running.

3131
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:09,600
We got bodyblocked because he can't interrupt this.

3132
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:33,240
I'm trying to heal you guys as best as I can.

3133
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,560
Get on the point, get on the point.

3134
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:48,700
Fuck, he saw me.

3135
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:01,210
That's crazy.

3136
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:02,550
Warm up.

3137
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:04,670
Get a warm up.

3138
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:11,610
I don't know.

3139
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:23,290
I mean, it's just the DPS diff and I'm not that good enough.

3140
02:05:24,130 --> 02:05:27,190
You were a last minute sub, so it's alright.

3141
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:32,750
You literally came into the server at like 10pm last night.

3142
02:05:33,670 --> 02:05:34,210
It's alright.

3143
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:38,530
I was not planning on playing in this, but it's all good.

3144
02:05:38,950 --> 02:05:39,390
You're fine.

3145
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:40,090
It's fine.

3146
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:41,050
You get $3,000.

3147
02:05:41,610 --> 02:05:42,350
Yeah, $3,000.

3148
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:44,110
That's all that matters.

3149
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:46,970
Next match is Flats.

3150
02:05:47,770 --> 02:05:48,470
Flats has been...

3151
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:50,850
He told me he's gonna go help out at charity, so...

3152
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:55,510
Flats' team has been scrimming, by the way, so they're gonna be extra sweaty.

3153
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:57,490
Fuck it.

3154
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,210
Yeah, fuck it.

3155
02:05:59,210 --> 02:06:03,990
I don't know who's on his team, because I need to get invited to his server.

3156
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:12,790
I'm gonna go Meg this game, I think.

3157
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:15,590
How's that?

3158
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,650
I think I need more.

3159
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:20,330
I think we need to peel, or I need to peel more.

3160
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:23,390
Because I'm doing as much as I can on Strange.

3161
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:24,870
But it doesn't matter.

3162
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:27,010
Like, Agamotto, I killed one and I still lose.

3163
02:06:27,770 --> 02:06:29,570
It doesn't really matter, because they have so much healing.

3164
02:06:30,490 --> 02:06:31,870
I mean, they do triple support.

3165
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:34,950
It's more so of just like...

3166
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:35,990
Get out of my lobby.

3167
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:39,230
We could just mirror triple support at that point.

3168
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:43,710
Does anyone have anybody on Flats' team added?

3169
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:45,550
Because I don't... they didn't add me.

3170
02:06:46,450 --> 02:06:47,170
I don't think so.

3171
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:50,130
It's Flats...

3172
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:54,510
Flats, Super, WeDid, Poe, Selene, and FanFan.

3173
02:06:54,830 --> 02:06:55,830
If anybody has them.

3174
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:04,230
Let me see if I can add Flats right now.

3175
02:07:04,410 --> 02:07:06,110
Flats, don't fight me.

3176
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,280
Guys, it's okay.

3177
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:18,320
I got a ranked squad after this.

3178
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,760
If I lose in rank, it's okay.

3179
02:07:20,860 --> 02:07:21,780
I guess I'll crash out.

3180
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:28,660
It's okay.

3181
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:33,320
Guys, I'm crashing out so much right now.

3182
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:35,460
So... wait, no, it's not out yet?

3183
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,040
No!

3184
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:38,480
I was going to buy the low-key costume.

3185
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:39,980
I was like, I'm going to crash out so hard.

3186
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:41,700
I'm going to buy the low-key costume.

3187
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:43,500
I'm going to live with my free money.

3188
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,160
Also, I'm going to use the bathtub right back.

3189
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,620
Dude, honestly...

3190
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:53,480
If they do like cringe triple healer every game, I might go Groot.

3191
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:54,920
Just like wall the tank off.

3192
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,660
Groot is good against triple heal.

3193
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:00,040
Yeah, I just only have like five hours on him, but like, that's fine.

3194
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:03,620
I believe.

3195
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:06,100
As long as I think his ult is grav, so...

3196
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,940
The range is...

3197
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:11,140
It does have a pretty big suck.

3198
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:12,320
Yeah, it does.

3199
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:47,970
It's crazy that people think I chose this team.

3200
02:08:50,030 --> 02:08:54,650
But I think like the only thing they asked me was like, you want to share it for us?

3201
02:08:54,650 --> 02:08:55,050
I was like, yeah.

3202
02:08:55,210 --> 02:08:56,870
And then I found out Kony was part of it.

3203
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:57,650
I was like, yeah, sure.

3204
02:08:58,110 --> 02:08:59,290
Bring Kony in my team.

3205
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:03,470
But Kony was already in the tournament.

3206
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:05,790
I was like, I want to play with Kony again.

3207
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:07,770
Um...

3208
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:13,030
But like, that's crazy people think that I stacked my team, but it was literally randomly assigned.

3209
02:09:13,410 --> 02:09:14,290
And stuff.

3210
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,110
Yeah, it's randomized.

3211
02:09:16,050 --> 02:09:19,770
It's randomized except for me, Surefour, and Kony.

3212
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:21,950
I'm like, how?

3213
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:23,810
It's a creator cup.

3214
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:24,790
How am I stacked?

3215
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:26,190
I recently was like...

3216
02:09:26,630 --> 02:09:28,110
I know some team actually...

3217
02:09:28,110 --> 02:09:31,230
I was told that some teams actually picked all their players.

3218
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:33,850
Um...

3219
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:37,110
They actually like hand-picked the players they want in their team.

3220
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:38,830
And everything too.

3221
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:40,610
For me, I was just like...

3222
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:45,170
Cause like, when I invited Surefour, Surefour was like, oh wait, you're captain?

3223
02:09:45,290 --> 02:09:46,250
I thought you had to pick everybody.

3224
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:47,750
I was like, no, I'm just randomized.

3225
02:09:49,210 --> 02:09:50,850
I didn't even know I was captain.

3226
02:09:52,290 --> 02:09:53,410
I didn't even...

3227
02:09:53,970 --> 02:09:56,590
I didn't even know I was captain.

3228
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:00,770
Those just gave me teammates.

3229
02:10:00,930 --> 02:10:01,830
I was just like, okay.

3230
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:07,730
I was just like...

3231
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:10,650
And Surefour was like, hey, I feel weird.

3232
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:15,390
Cause you know, everybody in the captain slot is an actual pro player.

3233
02:10:15,690 --> 02:10:18,730
Or has played pro in the past.

3234
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:20,470
And I'm just...

3235
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:21,670
I'm just...

3236
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:23,410
I'm just their keeper.

3237
02:10:28,850 --> 02:10:30,950
I was just like, I feel...

3238
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:32,250
This is awkward.

3239
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:39,170
I'm just an anim...

3240
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:40,490
I'm just a little guy.

3241
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:41,930
I'm just a little guy.

3242
02:10:42,110 --> 02:10:43,670
So like, I didn't...

3243
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:47,310
I know some teams handpicked their teammates, but I didn't.

3244
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:49,910
I was randomly assigned teammates and stuff.

3245
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,990
So we're just making the best of it.

3246
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:53,750
I literally came in knowing that it's a creator tournament.

3247
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:55,530
And...

3248
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:59,750
The first place just gets $700 more.

3249
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:01,350
I mean, not just.

3250
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:05,070
But it's not a huge gap in between first and last place.

3251
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:07,750
So I'm just like, I'm fine with that.

3252
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:10,470
Who the fuck?

3253
02:11:11,410 --> 02:11:12,050
Random... What?

3254
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:12,590
Okay.

3255
02:11:13,470 --> 02:11:15,510
Who the fuck is this guy?

3256
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:18,650
What the fuck?

3257
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:21,990
I thought that was for the lobby.

3258
02:11:25,230 --> 02:11:26,330
I was like, what is this?

3259
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,850
Is this the lobby?

3260
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:27,590
I was thinking about this, right?

3261
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:29,530
Adam Warlock, he's the perfect human, right?

3262
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:33,190
He has the same hairline as me, so does that mean I'm the perfect human?

3263
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:34,670
Are you gold?

3264
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:36,530
Oh, they're still in the game, that's why.

3265
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:38,310
I haven't died yet, but I can try.

3266
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:40,390
Well, I'm not going to try.

3267
02:11:40,690 --> 02:11:43,030
I'm not going to try, but when I die, I'll try to cocoon.

3268
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:47,390
I'm trying to like... because when I'm IGL-ing, it's very serious, too.

3269
02:11:47,690 --> 02:11:50,570
So I can't fuck around because I'm IGL-ing.

3270
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:56,070
So it's harder to bring the mood up when I have to IGL for this.

3271
02:11:56,070 --> 02:12:00,470
Oh, because they use the Johnny Storm combo and it just lasts a long time?

3272
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:02,450
That's why I was like, just put whatever the fuck you want.

3273
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:02,830
You can still cocoon after.

3274
02:12:04,430 --> 02:12:05,550
That thing lasts a while.

3275
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:09,870
Wait, guys, let me show you my adventures last night playing with Korean players.

3276
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:11,870
Wait, if Jeff eats you, I think you can cocoon.

3277
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:12,850
So for those who don't know...

3278
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:21,890
For those who don't know, Choppa is on the same team as FunFun and DDoBi.

3279
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:23,830
I'm working on that.

3280
02:12:24,490 --> 02:12:26,770
I have the same musculature, though.

3281
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:28,310
So I just need to paint myself gold.

3282
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:33,830
So when I was playing with Choppa, we actually went against FunFun.

3283
02:12:35,470 --> 02:12:36,610
I mean, I'm out all day.

3284
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:37,570
Let me show you guys.

3285
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:39,670
I'm not streaming, I work in construction.

3286
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:42,250
Wait, you double stacked that shit?

3287
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:45,890
I didn't play with them the entire time, though, because they had to go.

3288
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:50,310
Let me show you guys.

3289
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:52,450
We've got a compulsive liar on our team.

3290
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:54,650
I'm not a liar, I'm a storyteller.

3291
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:56,550
An entertainer.

3292
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:58,350
That wasn't a story, that was just lying.

3293
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:01,550
Let me show you a story in three parts.

3294
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:02,190
Like a hypothetical.

3295
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:07,430
I was asking you a genuine question and you just answered with a genuine lie.

3296
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:10,730
No, I don't go outside that much, but I was a student.

3297
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:12,670
And then this is part two.

3298
02:13:12,850 --> 02:13:13,510
Okay, what happened?

3299
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:15,530
So I'm in my last year.

3300
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,390
Law.

3301
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:19,530
Okay.

3302
02:13:19,530 --> 02:13:20,670
I'm a liar, yeah.

3303
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:23,070
No wonder you're not good at lying.

3304
02:13:23,310 --> 02:13:24,530
Part three of the story.

3305
02:13:26,110 --> 02:13:26,910
Pursue education.

3306
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:28,290
Very good.

3307
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,960
And then this is part three.

3308
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:34,600
Do we need to invite them?

3309
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,220
Or do we need to invite them?

3310
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:39,420
I think they're inviting us.

3311
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:43,040
They're still in game, so I'm just waiting.

3312
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:45,060
They're still in game, so I'm waiting for Vlads.

3313
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:46,500
Okay.

3314
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:49,340
But was the law school also a lie?

3315
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:50,600
No.

3316
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,680
Mercy carry, it's me.

3317
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:54,060
How do I know if you're telling the truth or not?

3318
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:55,880
Because I'm Canadian.

3319
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:57,260
You basically played against...

3320
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:58,000
I'm Canadian now.

3321
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:00,640
Okay, there we go.

3322
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,680
You play Genshin, so I'm just going to assume you always lie.

3323
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,860
Whoa, I played Overwatch.

3324
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:06,540
That's true.

3325
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:11,600
Literally just spending your money has rotted your brain.

3326
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:13,900
Okay, I'm free to play.

3327
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:15,440
Okay, that's a lie.

3328
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,060
Free to play is even worse.

3329
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,740
That's what I'm saying, bro.

3330
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:25,760
If you're free to play a player in a gacha game, that's like true mental illness.

3331
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:29,900
Yeah, bro, just put the money in the bag.

3332
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:34,000
No, the whole point of gacha games is to be like...

3333
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:38,100
Normies buy Gucci and Rolexes to flex.

3334
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:40,880
Weebs buy characters in a video game.

3335
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,480
That's true.

3336
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:43,840
So if you're free to play a player...

3337
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:46,220
Why the fuck did you decline the invite to the lobby?

3338
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:48,740
Because I'm fucking alt-tabbed.

3339
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:50,320
Get the fuck in.

3340
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:52,240
Okay, let's see.

3341
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:54,220
How about next time you say, hey, I invited you.

3342
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:57,220
No, you should have your game up all the time.

3343
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:04,460
You think I'm just going to be staring at this fucking screen while we're just AFK while I'm down 05 or 06, whatever we are?

3344
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:07,000
We're 05.

3345
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:08,320
It's okay, we'll be 07.

3346
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,820
We're about to be 1 and 5.

3347
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:11,800
Nah, we can beat these guys.

3348
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:13,420
Dude, we can.

3349
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:15,240
Just ban Wolverine.

3350
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:18,280
I don't want to fucking deal with Super's Wolverine right now.

3351
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:21,500
I'm praying.

3352
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:25,580
We're going to be 1 and 5.

3353
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:25,980
It's okay.

3354
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:28,140
Who are you missing?

3355
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:29,700
Can I flank Jeff again?

3356
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:37,640
I'm not one for you to ask me for permission.

3357
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:39,260
Just do whatever the fuck you want, guys.

3358
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:40,260
Yippee!

3359
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:42,660
This is anarchy.

3360
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,820
We're anarchists now.

3361
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:46,660
We're anarchists.

3362
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:48,980
Behold, Darkchild!

3363
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:52,260
Oh, we're missing...

3364
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:57,740
Let me change over.

3365
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:02,020
I'm sure these guys are honest men and we got a strange mirror.

3366
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:05,180
That'd be flat to play strange.

3367
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:06,740
Thank God.

3368
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:08,880
They have played a lot of The Thing.

3369
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:11,800
Yo, we played The Thing.

3370
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:13,900
We literally played strange thing versus strange thing.

3371
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:15,060
They make Nito the Thing.

3372
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:17,200
They make Mag the Thing.

3373
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,840
Mag is better with The Thing.

3374
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:21,120
Yeah, I know, but I want to play strange.

3375
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:21,740
I'll go Mag.

3376
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:23,080
You can play strange.

3377
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:25,380
If you want to play strange, play strange.

3378
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:26,520
Like Mag v.

3379
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:27,920
Mag, I'm like, I know what to do.

3380
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:28,400
Strange v.

3381
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:29,800
Strange, I like whip my cock out.

3382
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:30,540
Ready?

3383
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:33,320
Dude, Boger went Mag.

3384
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:34,240
Okay.

3385
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:37,380
No, this character's too broken.

3386
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:38,040
I gotta go Magneto.

3387
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:39,800
Bye, the Yacht.

3388
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,020
Bye, the Yacht.

3389
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:44,560
Bye, the Yacht.

3390
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:54,820
We're missing one person and they're not on my friends list.

3391
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:56,400
Saj.

3392
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:00,900
Wait, how come I didn't see Glorpfan in here?

3393
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:02,980
I'm here.

3394
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:03,920
Oh, there you are.

3395
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:06,140
Alright, are we all ready?

3396
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:08,900
Yes!

3397
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:10,840
Coney, do you really want to lose to Super?

3398
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:11,980
Now he's hyped.

3399
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:16,140
Coney doesn't want to lose to Super.

3400
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:18,900
He made a video about him and now he's...

3401
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:21,260
Yeah, but we'll beat him.

3402
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:22,200
That's fine.

3403
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:24,820
I'll make a video about how Super's ass.

3404
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:28,600
They scrimmed, so they might be a little more coordinated.

3405
02:17:28,860 --> 02:17:29,380
Oh no!

3406
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:31,540
Wait, I saw them.

3407
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:36,640
I watched one of their games and Super was on fucking Thing and they got clapped.

3408
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:39,480
Yeah, but he's their DPS player technically.

3409
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:40,860
Oh, okay.

3410
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:43,460
I saw their scrims.

3411
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:45,800
He plays DPS in ranked too.

3412
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:47,880
If he gets to play Wolverine.

3413
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:52,500
That's why I won't ban Wolverine because that's his main DPS role.

3414
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:53,820
Starting.

3415
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:58,380
I fucking hate this map.

3416
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:02,920
Yeah, this one sucks.

3417
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:05,380
That big ass hallway.

3418
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:08,000
Trif, are you going Jeff?

3419
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,420
I'll suss it out.

3420
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:12,700
What do you want to do?

3421
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,480
Are we finally running Widowmantis?

3422
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,800
I don't think I can play Jeff on this map.

3423
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:20,740
I don't know if Jeff is here.

3424
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:23,700
Jake, you're banning.

3425
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:24,460
Ban Wolverine.

3426
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:27,860
Goodbye Wolverine.

3427
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:30,800
We protect Jeff?

3428
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:34,040
This map is okay for Jeff, unfortunately.

3429
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:36,520
Yeah, it's hard to flank on this map.

3430
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:38,560
No, it's not hard to flank.

3431
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,360
It's just environmental for my ult.

3432
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:41,160
Who are we saving?

3433
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:43,540
Jeff.

3434
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:50,600
We're going to save whatever your hearts desire because we don't really have a specific character we want to save.

3435
02:18:51,060 --> 02:18:51,880
We can save whatever.

3436
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:53,260
I mean, we can save Matt.

3437
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:53,900
What?

3438
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:57,060
Why can't we do Widowmantis?

3439
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:01,600
Well, I'm pretty sure they looked at Tonka's profile and saw he was a Widowmantric.

3440
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,100
I mean...

3441
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:06,060
It is what it is.

3442
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,700
Matt is crazy.

3443
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:10,840
I do not get to play at all good.

3444
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,580
Wait, there is one flank I can do.

3445
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,480
What the hell?

3446
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:16,080
Someone's dying.

3447
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:17,540
What?

3448
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:19,360
Someone's dying.

3449
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,320
Is that a firearm?

3450
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,580
Are one of you guys in EMT?

3451
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:24,160
Are you at work?

3452
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:26,920
I could flank Loki.

3453
02:19:28,300 --> 02:19:30,440
Should I save Loki?

3454
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:32,860
No, it's Doki.

3455
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:34,080
Doki is getting flatlined.

3456
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:34,480
I don't know.

3457
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:35,400
Whatever you want, bro.

3458
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:49,320
Our team captain is dead.

3459
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:55,420
Loki.

3460
02:19:55,660 --> 02:19:55,940
Okay.

3461
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:59,000
Who am I banning?

3462
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:00,740
Just ban Namor.

3463
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:01,220
Fuck it.

3464
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:02,840
Where is he?

3465
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:08,880
We should just say he lagged out.

3466
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:11,700
Yeah, I wrote our captain died, Namor.

3467
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:14,400
Okay, our mental is cooked.

3468
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:15,440
Guys, lock in!

3469
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:26,320
Oh, it actually is a fire alarm.

3470
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:26,980
Oh, okay.

3471
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:27,820
Holy.

3472
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:30,920
Turn that shit back on if you don't have to get kicked out.

3473
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:31,960
Wait, they didn't ban either.

3474
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:33,120
I'll listen to the beeps.

3475
02:20:34,060 --> 02:20:36,460
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

3476
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:37,780
Good bans.

3477
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:41,780
They banned Venom.

3478
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:44,080
This is fun.

3479
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:56,590
You guys crumbled down when I stopped.

3480
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:58,750
I don't understand.

3481
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:00,470
How?

3482
02:21:01,390 --> 02:21:02,950
Oh my god.

3483
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:04,550
I'm not a team leader.

3484
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:06,790
I'm not a team leader.

3485
02:21:06,990 --> 02:21:08,670
I heard the fire alarm and it scared me.

3486
02:21:09,050 --> 02:21:09,630
Wait, fuck it.

3487
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:10,630
I'm going Mr. Fantastic.

3488
02:21:11,170 --> 02:21:11,870
Nah, I'm going Voink.

3489
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:12,370
I'm going.

3490
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:16,790
Fuck it.

3491
02:21:16,930 --> 02:21:18,570
This one, I can just die in the fire.

3492
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:21,150
Is it like a real alarm?

3493
02:21:21,310 --> 02:21:21,810
Are you okay?

3494
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:22,950
Keep it on!

3495
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:24,510
No, sometimes it's not real.

3496
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:25,510
I can't tell anymore.

3497
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:26,430
Is it like a test alarm?

3498
02:21:26,450 --> 02:21:27,630
I can't tell.

3499
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:32,310
Maybe it's like syncupation.

3500
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:35,710
Maybe we need it to be playing so it gets everyone's heads just constantly moving.

3501
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:37,070
I'm actually locked in now.

3502
02:21:37,130 --> 02:21:37,890
I'm actually locked in.

3503
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:40,950
I think we should wait.

3504
02:21:41,230 --> 02:21:41,730
It's fine, right?

3505
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:46,310
No, we fight.

3506
02:21:46,450 --> 02:21:46,850
We go.

3507
02:21:47,370 --> 02:21:47,670
Okay.

3508
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:50,690
This guy's talking in game too.

3509
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:51,770
That's how locked in he is.

3510
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:54,670
I think we go right on this map, but I don't know.

3511
02:21:55,690 --> 02:21:56,190
Actually, no.

3512
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:56,590
I do know.

3513
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:57,090
I'm IGL.

3514
02:21:57,150 --> 02:21:57,570
We go right.

3515
02:21:58,510 --> 02:21:59,030
Type shit.

3516
02:22:01,310 --> 02:22:01,850
We go up here.

3517
02:22:01,890 --> 02:22:02,210
We go up here.

3518
02:22:05,490 --> 02:22:06,390
Follow the captain!

3519
02:22:06,570 --> 02:22:07,310
Choo-choo!

3520
02:22:08,430 --> 02:22:09,070
All aboard!

3521
02:22:13,830 --> 02:22:15,290
These guys are probably like, man, they're going right.

3522
02:22:17,610 --> 02:22:18,090
Look mag!

3523
02:22:18,210 --> 02:22:18,470
Look mag!

3524
02:22:20,530 --> 02:22:20,770
Thing!

3525
02:22:21,550 --> 02:22:21,850
I'm on thing!

3526
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:22,150
I'm on thing!

3527
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:22,450
I'm on thing!

3528
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:26,010
Oh, I'm getting cooked.

3529
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:27,230
Look at mag!

3530
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:28,410
Yeah, mag could die.

3531
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:28,710
Mag could die.

3532
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:29,490
Alright, shield.

3533
02:22:29,950 --> 02:22:30,690
I'm so weak.

3534
02:22:40,390 --> 02:22:41,810
Hella's like kind of frontline map.

3535
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:48,090
The healers are like... Can we look Hella?

3536
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:48,550
Can we look Hella?

3537
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:49,110
I got Hella.

3538
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:49,230
I got Hella.

3539
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:49,990
Think, think, think, think, think, think.

3540
02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:51,650
Maybe healers?

3541
02:22:51,730 --> 02:22:52,350
Can we walk up to healers?

3542
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,470
Healers?

3543
02:22:58,610 --> 02:22:58,770
Healers?

3544
02:22:59,050 --> 02:23:00,510
Got it.

3545
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:02,130
Oh,

3546
02:23:05,710 --> 02:23:07,390
I'm fucking beating the shit out of them.

3547
02:23:09,370 --> 02:23:10,370
I busted on them.

3548
02:23:10,910 --> 02:23:12,730
All we needed was Iron Face.

3549
02:23:12,830 --> 02:23:13,790
I'm beating the shit out of them.

3550
02:23:13,930 --> 02:23:14,170
Shit.

3551
02:23:16,630 --> 02:23:17,530
I'm walking up.

3552
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,330
They're going to stagger.

3553
02:23:18,810 --> 02:23:19,310
I feel it.

3554
02:23:19,550 --> 02:23:21,250
No, these guys scrimmed.

3555
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:21,810
They did scrim.

3556
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:22,930
They did.

3557
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:28,790
Yo, can we hear the fire alarm real quick?

3558
02:23:29,410 --> 02:23:29,750
Sure.

3559
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:30,090
Sure.

3560
02:23:30,950 --> 02:23:30,950
Sure.

3561
02:23:34,290 --> 02:23:36,490
We have to win or America's under siege.

3562
02:23:36,490 --> 02:23:37,450
You ult first.

3563
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:38,590
Okay.

3564
02:23:41,590 --> 02:23:42,490
Am I to ult this?

3565
02:23:43,130 --> 02:23:43,910
Yo, fight this Hella.

3566
02:23:43,910 --> 02:23:45,730
Yeah, I see the full backline here.

3567
02:23:45,910 --> 02:23:46,470
What the fuck?

3568
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:47,030
Oh, okay.

3569
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:48,070
Oh, they got...

3570
02:23:50,470 --> 02:23:51,150
Okay, well...

3571
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:52,150
I'm getting them.

3572
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:52,870
I'm fucking them up.

3573
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:53,750
I'm beating the shit out of them.

3574
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:01,520
Walk them down.

3575
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:05,560
Oh my god.

3576
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:10,440
We have to win or I'm going to get clipped by fucking super TF Yowie.

3577
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:12,660
Wait, this might be our win, boys.

3578
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,140
Wait.

3579
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:16,720
I'm going in.

3580
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:17,240
Fire alarm.

3581
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:19,140
Yo, you're stuck in there.

3582
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,480
There's a wall.

3583
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,200
They haven't killed anybody yet.

3584
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:24,320
Oh no, not in this small asshole.

3585
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:24,680
Wait.

3586
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:25,560
I got pushed.

3587
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:26,500
Wait, I need help.

3588
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:28,000
I have a small woman.

3589
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:28,580
Oh.

3590
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:31,380
Okay.

3591
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,020
Oh, good regroup.

3592
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:37,930
I hate him as a woman.

3593
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,710
She just pulls you in.

3594
02:24:38,770 --> 02:24:38,870
GG.

3595
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:41,090
Yeah, she'd do that.

3596
02:24:41,630 --> 02:24:41,750
I know.

3597
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:44,850
Damn, stayed on that cart a while, though.

3598
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:47,010
Are we regrouping?

3599
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:47,610
High performance.

3600
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:52,600
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

3601
02:24:55,420 --> 02:24:56,440
Our Luna isn't here.

3602
02:24:58,260 --> 02:24:58,800
Oh, good.

3603
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:00,240
On the way, on the way, on the way.

3604
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,840
Oh, big pull!

3605
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:03,660
I'm blocking healing.

3606
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:04,220
No, I'm not.

3607
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:04,520
I lied.

3608
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:06,920
Wait, I'm low.

3609
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:07,820
I have ult.

3610
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:11,080
I'm gonna... I'm ulting back.

3611
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:14,280
I'm waiting, waiting.

3612
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:16,320
I'm ulting when this is up.

3613
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:18,700
I have no shield.

3614
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:19,340
I can't block it.

3615
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:23,200
I can block a bit now.

3616
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:29,160
Thing's on me in the back.

3617
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:30,300
Oh, god.

3618
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,800
I think we might be resetting.

3619
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:33,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3620
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,080
I hit a wall.

3621
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:35,300
Okay.

3622
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:40,300
All good.

3623
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:40,940
We walk up.

3624
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:48,180
Ryke with me.

3625
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:49,160
Oh, I got Ryke'd.

3626
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:50,940
I think he was going for you.

3627
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:58,980
Thing is top right.

3628
02:26:03,030 --> 02:26:03,950
I'm looking for Agamotto.

3629
02:26:03,950 --> 02:26:04,250
Agamotto?

3630
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:07,350
Oh, my god.

3631
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:07,830
Jesus.

3632
02:26:08,650 --> 02:26:11,190
I could get a big Agamotto here, but...

3633
02:26:11,190 --> 02:26:13,550
Look, I really want to ult.

3634
02:26:14,570 --> 02:26:14,890
Okay.

3635
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:21,350
Wait, let me walk up first this time.

3636
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:22,630
Just, like, keep me healthy.

3637
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:26,290
And then you can jump to me, Coney, when I get close.

3638
02:26:26,510 --> 02:26:26,690
Yep.

3639
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:28,310
I'm gonna Agamotto.

3640
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:30,810
I just... I know they're fucking invis gonna push me away.

3641
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:33,050
Okay, I'm gonna ult and distract them and then maybe...

3642
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:33,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3643
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:34,950
No, you ult and then I ult.

3644
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:35,370
Let me walk up.

3645
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:35,810
Let me walk up.

3646
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:37,310
Yeah, get ready to push.

3647
02:26:37,610 --> 02:26:38,190
Yeah, I'm close.

3648
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:39,330
Let's pause.

3649
02:26:39,830 --> 02:26:40,130
I'm here.

3650
02:26:40,510 --> 02:26:40,790
Wait.

3651
02:26:41,130 --> 02:26:41,650
I'm low.

3652
02:26:42,330 --> 02:26:42,690
Oh,

3653
02:26:46,910 --> 02:26:47,910
my soul fucking beat.

3654
02:26:47,970 --> 02:26:48,530
Oh, yeah.

3655
02:26:48,710 --> 02:26:49,410
Like, I feel it.

3656
02:26:49,970 --> 02:26:50,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3657
02:26:50,550 --> 02:26:53,210
Oh, I don't need to shoot him.

3658
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,670
I'll just beat the shit out of him.

3659
02:26:55,630 --> 02:26:55,970
I'm thinking.

3660
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:58,350
I can't fly up.

3661
02:26:58,810 --> 02:26:59,810
Oh, my...

3662
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:07,320
I'm using mine.

3663
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:08,440
I'm looking Hella.

3664
02:27:09,740 --> 02:27:10,460
Yeah, I see Hella.

3665
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:12,060
I'm looking...

3666
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:12,700
Mag can die.

3667
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,760
No, it didn't do the auto-track kick.

3668
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:23,560
Orly on the left.

3669
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:26,480
Both...

3670
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:27,620
Two of the healers are dead.

3671
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:33,800
Mag can...

3672
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,720
Invis, invis is beating.

3673
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:37,720
I'm blocking it.

3674
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,020
They're blocking?

3675
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:43,280
Strange on cart.

3676
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:46,000
Oh...

3677
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,320
I can only have Luna right now.

3678
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:47,900
He's one.

3679
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:49,640
Yay.

3680
02:27:55,670 --> 02:27:56,970
Probably try to shoot both here.

3681
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:02,870
I'm trying to get both.

3682
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:03,830
Got it.

3683
02:28:04,670 --> 02:28:05,370
I'm about to get Agumoto.

3684
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:06,430
Sue, Sue, Sue.

3685
02:28:06,910 --> 02:28:07,310
Are we here?

3686
02:28:07,390 --> 02:28:07,730
Can I Agumoto?

3687
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:10,410
Ah, I saw his bite.

3688
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:10,930
Might as well.

3689
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:14,150
Ah, I can't really get much there.

3690
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:15,610
Last bite.

3691
02:28:15,610 --> 02:28:16,830
Yeah, I know.

3692
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:20,740
Sturge can die, Sturge can die, Sturge can die.

3693
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:27,430
Damn.

3694
02:28:28,190 --> 02:28:28,830
Is this the all of them?

3695
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:32,710
Ah, man.

3696
02:28:32,950 --> 02:28:34,850
Guys, the fire alarm hasn't stopped.

3697
02:28:35,250 --> 02:28:35,850
I'm a...

3698
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:38,550
I mean, we literally don't care about hearing it.

3699
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:39,910
You know you can talk, right?

3700
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:40,430
Guys.

3701
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:42,870
No, but the fire alarm hasn't stopped.

3702
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:43,790
Who cares?

3703
02:28:44,850 --> 02:28:46,230
I'm a little...

3704
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:48,950
I don't think this is a false alarm anymore.

3705
02:28:49,970 --> 02:28:50,410
I...

3706
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,990
You have to...

3707
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:53,870
I mean, we could replay one round.

3708
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:54,710
I...

3709
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:55,870
I don't know.

3710
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:57,270
Hey, if you have to go, you gotta go.

3711
02:28:57,290 --> 02:28:59,030
I mean, if it's a fire, you should probably...

3712
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:00,330
I don't...

3713
02:29:00,330 --> 02:29:00,930
I don't know.

3714
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:15,950
They're saying they cheated.

3715
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:16,690
Aw.

3716
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:20,270
Aw, they're gonna get trouble.

3717
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:32,840
They did cheat.

3718
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:34,740
Aw.

3719
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:50,540
Ha ha ha.

3720
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:58,270
Use money from tournament for a new apartment.

3721
02:29:59,590 --> 02:30:00,870
Mmm, wait.

3722
02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:02,130
I'm checking if they're portaling.

3723
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:04,750
They're not portaling.

3724
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:09,030
Wise.

3725
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:11,790
Hey, I guess...

3726
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:12,270
Are you...

3727
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:14,730
I mean, lock-in, I guess, but...

3728
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:16,390
Oh, there goes Jeff.

3729
02:30:16,390 --> 02:30:16,990
I could go mag here if I die.

3730
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:18,270
Patoot, patoot, patoot.

3731
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:36,380
Oh, we can kill mag.

3732
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:39,240
Oh my god, he fucking owned me.

3733
02:30:40,980 --> 02:30:41,460
Wow.

3734
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,240
No way.

3735
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,200
Alarm stopped.

3736
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,240
Getting away with one HP.

3737
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:50,340
The alarm stopped?

3738
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:50,640
Yippee!

3739
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:51,520
The alarm stopped?

3740
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:53,180
I think I have more kills.

3741
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:53,900
We were safe.

3742
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:57,480
They're so killable there.

3743
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:58,180
Alright.

3744
02:30:59,120 --> 02:30:59,600
Yeah.

3745
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:01,240
I didn't say Jeff was bad on this map.

3746
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:03,060
Oh, it's good for first point.

3747
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:04,020
Oh, okay.

3748
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:06,300
But we all died.

3749
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:07,660
Yeah, sadge.

3750
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:08,800
That's life.

3751
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,320
It is what it is.

3752
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,560
Okay, we hold this.

3753
02:31:15,140 --> 02:31:16,420
Like the champions we are.

3754
02:31:21,660 --> 02:31:22,780
I don't want to take this base.

3755
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,100
We down?

3756
02:31:23,980 --> 02:31:24,800
I'm always down.

3757
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:30,560
Link me up.

3758
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:33,300
I'm trying my best to heal all of you.

3759
02:31:33,380 --> 02:31:34,580
You're all so very low.

3760
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:37,320
I'll ult first.

3761
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:37,820
I'll ult first.

3762
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:39,040
Okay.

3763
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:42,020
Block my part.

3764
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:45,140
Oh, that's huge.

3765
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:47,120
Oh, you have shield.

3766
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:47,660
No!

3767
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:48,920
No!

3768
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:52,700
Oh, my.

3769
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:55,820
I think we just fucking reset here.

3770
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:56,200
I can portal.

3771
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,020
We have to reset.

3772
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:01,760
I just got a reminder.

3773
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:03,400
What's the reminder?

3774
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,740
During God of Death, Hela...

3775
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:06,060
I can't read.

3776
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:09,000
I'm going to portal here.

3777
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:10,960
Yeah, we're waiting.

3778
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:12,000
We're waiting for portal.

3779
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:14,580
Coney, we're portaling.

3780
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:15,540
Okay.

3781
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:16,420
Hold on.

3782
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:17,600
I'm going to same spot they portaled.

3783
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:18,880
Actually, it's a bit different.

3784
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:20,180
It's his last fight anyway.

3785
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,700
I'm going to look for Agumon.

3786
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:26,340
What the fuck?

3787
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:26,940
I didn't even see that.

3788
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:27,300
I'm low.

3789
02:32:28,060 --> 02:32:28,980
I'm trying to.

3790
02:32:32,120 --> 02:32:32,800
Walking is healing?

3791
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:33,160
Nope.

3792
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:37,340
We don't have any support ults for this.

3793
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:37,940
No.

3794
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:40,960
That's huge.

3795
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:41,400
That's huge.

3796
02:32:43,580 --> 02:32:45,140
We have to look closer.

3797
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:47,960
Adam's cocooning on our left.

3798
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:49,780
Adam is one.

3799
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:50,800
We got Adam.

3800
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:53,680
He's fine.

3801
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:55,100
No more ults.

3802
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:56,020
No more ults.

3803
02:32:56,660 --> 02:32:57,980
Hela to the right.

3804
02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:05,570
Technically, we can kill that.

3805
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:06,230
Oh, wait.

3806
02:33:06,790 --> 02:33:07,490
Yeah, we can still.

3807
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:08,090
Nice.

3808
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:09,870
We have to stack these guys.

3809
02:33:10,310 --> 02:33:10,950
Much respect.

3810
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:17,210
Every game has been triple healer.

3811
02:33:17,490 --> 02:33:18,110
Why didn't we...

3812
02:33:18,110 --> 02:33:18,670
Because it's meta.

3813
02:33:18,670 --> 02:33:19,250
Why are we 2-2-2?

3814
02:33:19,590 --> 02:33:20,750
We can't because...

3815
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:21,850
Why is the team 2-2-2?

3816
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:24,390
We can't because we don't have a...

3817
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:26,750
We don't have a secondary tank player.

3818
02:33:27,150 --> 02:33:29,050
I'm seeing that adventure just in like 2-1-3.

3819
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:35,030
I'm fighting...

3820
02:33:35,030 --> 02:33:36,570
I have ult.

3821
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:38,270
They have...

3822
02:33:38,270 --> 02:33:39,610
They have thing ult too.

3823
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:42,050
Oh, I couldn't get to you there.

3824
02:33:45,730 --> 02:33:46,530
Help Coney.

3825
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:47,210
Help Coney.

3826
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:48,310
He has ult too.

3827
02:33:49,770 --> 02:33:50,430
We walk on Adam.

3828
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:51,030
We walk on Adam.

3829
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:51,490
Yup.

3830
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:53,270
I have to...

3831
02:33:53,270 --> 02:33:53,890
We are...

3832
02:33:53,890 --> 02:33:54,130
Guys.

3833
02:33:54,310 --> 02:33:54,590
Guys.

3834
02:33:54,730 --> 02:33:54,950
Guys.

3835
02:33:55,050 --> 02:33:55,550
We have a thing.

3836
02:33:56,850 --> 02:33:57,690
Here's the thing.

3837
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:01,270
Winnable.

3838
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:03,990
Like, we got to stop protecting these guys.

3839
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:04,990
We walked into their backline.

3840
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:06,310
Oh, nevermind.

3841
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:07,430
Yeah, we can't...

3842
02:34:07,430 --> 02:34:09,170
We can't push our dmg back.

3843
02:34:09,170 --> 02:34:10,530
We can't do both.

3844
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:14,450
Yeah, but me and the Hela were trapped on front.

3845
02:34:14,610 --> 02:34:15,070
That's why.

3846
02:34:21,470 --> 02:34:22,410
Nagamoto after this.

3847
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:22,850
I see you guys.

3848
02:34:27,070 --> 02:34:27,750
We need it.

3849
02:34:27,810 --> 02:34:28,090
We need it.

3850
02:34:28,130 --> 02:34:28,550
We need it.

3851
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:30,410
Big.

3852
02:34:31,250 --> 02:34:31,690
Okay.

3853
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:36,060
Gosh, cut that out, man.

3854
02:34:40,460 --> 02:34:41,380
We have no supports.

3855
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:46,100
Coming back right now.

3856
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:48,640
I'm just trying to stall.

3857
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:54,640
I've frozen, but I can't live.

3858
02:34:58,700 --> 02:34:59,220
Bleh.

3859
02:35:07,470 --> 02:35:09,910
I've fallen three seconds.

3860
02:35:10,130 --> 02:35:11,150
I don't think we can touch.

3861
02:35:12,670 --> 02:35:13,290
Warm up.

3862
02:35:35,570 --> 02:35:36,070
That was unlucky.

3863
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:37,830
The universe didn't want us to win that.

3864
02:35:38,330 --> 02:35:39,690
Yeah, that's life sometimes, isn't it?

3865
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:43,590
Should I just, like, play a healer?

3866
02:35:48,530 --> 02:35:50,130
I have 13 final hits.

3867
02:35:50,350 --> 02:35:51,670
Like, they're just getting fucking killed.

3868
02:35:56,990 --> 02:35:58,310
Yeah, you should go check outside.

3869
02:35:58,630 --> 02:36:00,410
The fire is burning up my building right now.

3870
02:36:00,470 --> 02:36:01,390
I'll be right back.

3871
02:36:02,050 --> 02:36:02,430
Aight.

3872
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:16,560
I'm gonna go pee.

3873
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:44,820
I mean, the elevators are working, so I assume it's not a fire.

3874
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:48,480
I think if it was a real fire, somebody would've gotcha.

3875
02:37:48,900 --> 02:37:50,120
Somebody would've been like, hey, it's a real fire.

3876
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:54,440
I feel like they would've said stuff, because you can say stuff in the intercom with the fire alarm.

3877
02:37:54,580 --> 02:37:56,260
And nobody's saying anything.

3878
02:37:56,620 --> 02:37:57,440
What if the intercom burned?

3879
02:37:57,840 --> 02:37:58,880
Oh, that's true.

3880
02:37:59,140 --> 02:37:59,840
That's true.

3881
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:00,620
What if there's aliens?

3882
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:03,640
Hello?

3883
02:38:07,990 --> 02:38:10,310
I just wanted him to think about what he said there.

3884
02:38:10,530 --> 02:38:10,930
Alright.

3885
02:38:12,430 --> 02:38:13,650
Give me your money.

3886
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:17,310
I feel like Glorp would sound more higher-pitched.

3887
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:20,090
Wouldn't Glorp be a cat, too?

3888
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:22,290
You have to meow now.

3889
02:38:22,650 --> 02:38:23,830
No, but it's like a smart cat.

3890
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:24,390
Like, it's an alien.

3891
02:38:24,490 --> 02:38:25,250
It can speak every language.

3892
02:38:25,410 --> 02:38:25,990
You gotta meow.

3893
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:28,270
I won't believe you're Glorp until you meow.

3894
02:38:29,410 --> 02:38:30,230
I can't meow.

3895
02:38:30,790 --> 02:38:32,390
I'm inviting people in.

3896
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:37,490
What the hell

3897
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:52,330
is this?

3898
02:38:53,830 --> 02:38:54,950
Okay, I invited everybody.

3899
02:39:02,530 --> 02:39:04,490
Booger has to fucking leave.

3900
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:05,630
He's still here.

3901
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,340
I don't think it's a natural fire.

3902
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:18,440
iPhone 8 loser.

3903
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:20,800
That's Calvin.

3904
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:22,500
Oh, shit.

3905
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:27,660
Because, like...

3906
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:33,980
Because there were people that went back to their apartment.

3907
02:39:34,180 --> 02:39:35,760
They went back to their room.

3908
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:37,460
So, they went back to their...

3909
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:40,320
I saw one person, like, come out of the elevator.

3910
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:44,640
I saw some people come out of the elevator to go back to their room.

3911
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:46,500
So, I assume everything is okay.

3912
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:53,020
I just think... I don't know.

3913
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:57,580
Maybe, like, someone fucking started a mini-fire or something.

3914
02:39:57,700 --> 02:39:58,740
And it was just okay.

3915
02:39:58,960 --> 02:39:59,660
I don't know.

3916
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:02,340
But, like, I'm okay now.

3917
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:06,120
Are we all ready?

3918
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:07,300
Yeah.

3919
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:10,080
We are...

3920
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:11,340
Wait, do we know what we ban?

3921
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:12,660
I don't know anyone here except Shoto.

3922
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:15,620
They like playing Starlord.

3923
02:40:16,060 --> 02:40:17,100
Just ban Starlord, then.

3924
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:19,180
And then Loki.

3925
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:21,200
Alright, I'm done.

3926
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:24,200
Or...

3927
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:26,380
Shoto's Loki one trick.

3928
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,260
He can play fucking Namor.

3929
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:31,700
He was a really good Namor player in the VTuber Rivals.

3930
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:32,700
Because I had him on my team.

3931
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:34,700
Well, he's playing support, though.

3932
02:40:34,800 --> 02:40:36,420
Oh, is he a support on this team?

3933
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:36,560
So, no bans.

3934
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:36,940
Oh, yeah.

3935
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:38,260
Yeah, it's a Loki one trick.

3936
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:40,020
We could go Loki, then.

3937
02:40:40,180 --> 02:40:40,860
I don't mind whatever.

3938
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:41,940
No bans!

3939
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:43,460
So, I'm not banning anyone.

3940
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:45,200
I don't care.

3941
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:46,800
It's the last game.

3942
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:48,060
And I'm...

3943
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:48,880
It's LG here.

3944
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:52,700
I mean, if we win the...

3945
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:55,220
Just ban Loki.

3946
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:55,820
Fuck it.

3947
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:57,380
Just fuck over Shoto, I guess.

3948
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:58,400
Okay, fuck it.

3949
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:00,280
We actually can't go 007.

3950
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:01,120
Like, we have to win.

3951
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:04,560
Well, then we better freaking win.

3952
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:05,240
Alright, then you IGL.

3953
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:06,540
You IGL.

3954
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:07,940
Yes!

3955
02:41:08,860 --> 02:41:09,660
You IGL.

3956
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:11,900
I just play the game.

3957
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:18,260
Okay, I said don't do it.

3958
02:41:21,380 --> 02:41:23,980
Alright, what do you want to protect, IGL?

3959
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:27,480
Let's protect...

3960
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:29,380
Our...

3961
02:41:29,380 --> 02:41:31,380
Honestly, Luna, bro.

3962
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:32,300
They've been banning Luna.

3963
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:33,840
You want to protect Luna?

3964
02:41:34,340 --> 02:41:34,800
No, I don't care.

3965
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:35,780
I don't think we need to protect anything.

3966
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:36,940
They protected Star-Lord.

3967
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:39,560
Mag, maybe?

3968
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:40,320
Are we going Mag?

3969
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:42,840
I can protect Mag.

3970
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,420
But are we going Mag?

3971
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:45,700
Well, I don't know.

3972
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:46,820
Kone, are you doing Mag or Thing?

3973
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:48,980
Uh, I'm good with either.

3974
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:49,580
Bam, whatever.

3975
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:50,100
I don't care.

3976
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:51,360
I mean, I'll just...

3977
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:52,420
I'll just say Mag.

3978
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:53,180
I'm good with...

3979
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:53,840
Yeah, just say Mag.

3980
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:59,240
Just ban Adam Warlock if you don't want to deal with triple Rescomp.

3981
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:02,000
Yeah, they are going Star-Lord.

3982
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:03,840
I could ban Adam then.

3983
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,440
Or Mantis.

3984
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:06,620
Well, Adam gives the Res.

3985
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:08,680
IGL, what do you think?

3986
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:09,820
Whatever you think is best.

3987
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:10,100
Make the call.

3988
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:11,300
Yeah, yeah, get Adam out of here.

3989
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:11,760
It's your call, coach.

3990
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:13,600
Get that hot, oiled up man out of here.

3991
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:14,120
Ban Jeff?

3992
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:15,200
He's oiled?

3993
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:16,380
Oh.

3994
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:19,040
I'll fucking kick you off the team.

3995
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:21,460
Okay.

3996
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:26,520
Van of Tech Cactuses.

3997
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:29,420
Okay.

3998
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:31,840
One win.

3999
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:32,880
Alright, let's do it.

4000
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:34,840
One win.

4001
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:38,320
Let's do it big.

4002
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:39,760
Okay.

4003
02:42:41,700 --> 02:42:42,320
That's okay.

4004
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:47,580
Okay, we have to go Mag if we protected him.

4005
02:42:52,260 --> 02:42:52,620
Magnetis.

4006
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:03,580
Yeah, I think we can keep Invis.

4007
02:43:03,700 --> 02:43:04,100
I like this.

4008
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:06,000
Actually, I'm down for Mag.

4009
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:06,520
You go Strange.

4010
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:08,600
I kind of want to play Mag here.

4011
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:10,140
Yes sir, yes sir.

4012
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:12,860
I'm stuck in an animation.

4013
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:24,760
It's probably going to be bullshit on the bridge, high ground.

4014
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:26,240
I'm going to jump up on them.

4015
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:28,480
And then whoever can follow can follow.

4016
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,320
Like Psylocke or whatever.

4017
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:31,280
And then Magneto just keep our support safe.

4018
02:43:32,700 --> 02:43:33,040
Yeah, okay.

4019
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:34,960
I play Strange with Aston usually.

4020
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:39,240
I'm going to do that this game.

4021
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:43,800
Okay.

4022
02:43:50,420 --> 02:43:52,000
Alright, let's go.

4023
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:53,440
I'm going.

4024
02:43:55,140 --> 02:43:55,720
Hangover.

4025
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:58,360
Oh, they have Groot.

4026
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:00,600
They didn't ban you, did they?

4027
02:44:01,220 --> 02:44:02,800
We didn't ban anyone, Groot.

4028
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:05,160
So they're going to use combo.

4029
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:07,180
Their support can up heal it.

4030
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:09,200
Baby, I'm paying on you tonight.

4031
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:13,700
Don't let go tonight.

4032
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:14,980
Don't let go.

4033
02:44:15,100 --> 02:44:16,180
Just shoot a wall at the wall here.

4034
02:44:16,460 --> 02:44:16,800
At the choke.

4035
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:19,360
Is there no more fucking turret top left?

4036
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:20,960
Uh oh.

4037
02:44:21,280 --> 02:44:21,720
There's wall.

4038
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:23,740
I'm going to make space here.

4039
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:24,440
I'm walking on...

4040
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:25,160
Nevermind, I got pushed.

4041
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:26,120
I'm going to walk on Groot.

4042
02:44:27,240 --> 02:44:27,760
I'm on Groot.

4043
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:29,380
There's a Starlord on the support.

4044
02:44:30,220 --> 02:44:30,860
I'm shielding healing.

4045
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:31,240
Shoot him.

4046
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:34,020
There's a Starlord on support.

4047
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:35,060
I got Magged.

4048
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:37,120
I kidnapped for Groot.

4049
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:39,120
Alright, I have to walk.

4050
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:39,900
I'm walking back.

4051
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:42,100
There's a Starlord behind us.

4052
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:43,940
There's a Starlord.

4053
02:44:45,540 --> 02:44:46,840
I got him.

4054
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:51,340
He's just going to be trying to go in with E bubble every time.

4055
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:52,860
Yeah, so annoying.

4056
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,600
We might have to look back at the Starlord.

4057
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:56,340
I have ult.

4058
02:44:56,380 --> 02:44:57,900
I'm just going to go straight in.

4059
02:44:58,960 --> 02:44:59,560
I'm not here yet.

4060
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:01,940
Yeah, but I will bring...

4061
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:03,400
Kidnap the Groot.

4062
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:08,480
Four.

4063
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:09,400
Three.

4064
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:10,500
Bye.

4065
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:11,500
Two.

4066
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:12,040
One.

4067
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:15,220
I died right when I got my ult.

4068
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:15,960
Oh, that's unlucky.

4069
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:25,460
I was 1% off from Mag ult.

4070
02:45:25,540 --> 02:45:26,260
I could have caught that.

4071
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:27,720
They still have Invis ult.

4072
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:29,620
And they have Namor ult.

4073
02:45:30,020 --> 02:45:31,040
They didn't use Namor ult.

4074
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,000
Actually, they're just going to Groot all of us now.

4075
02:45:34,360 --> 02:45:34,980
No, they used it.

4076
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:35,320
They used it.

4077
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:35,880
Oh, okay.

4078
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:36,480
Bad, bad, bad.

4079
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:37,920
I'm opening a portal.

4080
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:40,740
They know they're backing up.

4081
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:41,940
I'm going to do the different high ground.

4082
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:43,100
Wait, there's someone right above us.

4083
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:43,260
Luna.

4084
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:44,920
Look top right.

4085
02:45:46,700 --> 02:45:47,300
Oh, she dropped.

4086
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:48,400
No, she's still there.

4087
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:51,060
Okay.

4088
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,360
I froze somebody.

4089
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:54,420
And we're in a bubble.

4090
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:55,820
There's more of the Luna up there.

4091
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:00,380
Oh, I got caught in the ceiling.

4092
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:03,260
The house rebuilt itself.

4093
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:05,960
Blocked it.

4094
02:46:13,180 --> 02:46:14,940
There's supports at the front.

4095
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:16,340
The supports are just at the front line.

4096
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:17,600
With the Namor.

4097
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:18,520
I got the Namor.

4098
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:21,040
Let's get one down.

4099
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:22,320
I'm one.

4100
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:38,010
Ow.

4101
02:46:39,930 --> 02:46:40,570
Look, Mag.

4102
02:46:41,830 --> 02:46:42,730
I'm all here.

4103
02:46:43,030 --> 02:46:43,590
I'm just going to wait.

4104
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:44,610
Probably pressure healers here.

4105
02:46:46,630 --> 02:46:47,530
I'm just going to try.

4106
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:48,870
I'll try ulting the Gruul.

4107
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:49,890
Because they don't have Namor yet.

4108
02:46:50,590 --> 02:46:52,630
They don't have Namor.

4109
02:46:58,070 --> 02:46:59,150
Get the Gruul.

4110
02:47:00,970 --> 02:47:02,650
Three, two, one.

4111
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:03,390
No more ults.

4112
02:47:10,510 --> 02:47:10,710
Damn.

4113
02:47:11,310 --> 02:47:11,890
Good luck, Starlord.

4114
02:47:14,090 --> 02:47:15,170
Yeah, let them use stuff, I guess.

4115
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:15,850
I have Agumon.

4116
02:47:16,330 --> 02:47:17,410
I have three ults coming.

4117
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:20,410
Can win with the Viz ult, probably.

4118
02:47:21,870 --> 02:47:23,090
They have Namor ult here.

4119
02:47:24,430 --> 02:47:24,930
Yeah.

4120
02:47:25,190 --> 02:47:26,810
I'm at 80%.

4121
02:47:27,420 --> 02:47:28,830
We can save Bubble to get aggro.

4122
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:29,970
And use it on the Diver.

4123
02:47:32,810 --> 02:47:33,710
I'll look for Agumon.

4124
02:47:36,130 --> 02:47:37,050
Shooting squids.

4125
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:42,930
Walking up.

4126
02:47:43,030 --> 02:47:43,730
Starlord behind us.

4127
02:47:43,930 --> 02:47:44,510
Keep me up.

4128
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:46,190
I'm trying to.

4129
02:47:46,830 --> 02:47:47,630
Everyone's weak.

4130
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:50,130
Do we have shield?

4131
02:47:50,250 --> 02:47:50,870
Do we have shield?

4132
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:53,830
I only got thing.

4133
02:47:53,930 --> 02:47:54,250
Sorry.

4134
02:47:58,610 --> 02:47:59,510
Wait, if this can die.

4135
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:03,370
Oh, well this is good.

4136
02:48:06,850 --> 02:48:07,970
Hey, all good?

4137
02:48:08,070 --> 02:48:08,510
Did we drop?

4138
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:10,230
Yeah.

4139
02:48:10,710 --> 02:48:12,010
Is this one ITLing?

4140
02:48:12,110 --> 02:48:12,870
I know it's not.

4141
02:48:16,370 --> 02:48:17,090
Yo, drawable?

4142
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:21,550
I feel like first fight we should have won, though.

4143
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:22,010
I don't know what happened.

4144
02:48:23,810 --> 02:48:25,510
For the first fight.

4145
02:48:26,290 --> 02:48:26,330
Life.

4146
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:26,730
Life happens.

4147
02:48:27,210 --> 02:48:32,290
The first fight the Starlord was on me, Lulu, and Jake.

4148
02:48:32,470 --> 02:48:34,810
So we couldn't progress forward.

4149
02:48:37,890 --> 02:48:39,810
It was the Starlord E'd all three of us.

4150
02:48:40,350 --> 02:48:43,190
And me and Lulu called him out behind us.

4151
02:48:44,490 --> 02:48:45,210
Yeah, I'm Wolverine.

4152
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:46,310
I can't kill a Starlord.

4153
02:48:46,390 --> 02:48:46,650
Yeah.

4154
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:50,800
Honestly, fuck it.

4155
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:51,280
I'll send Groot.

4156
02:48:54,610 --> 02:48:55,590
Might as well, bro.

4157
02:48:57,890 --> 02:48:59,230
Push a Groot.

4158
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:06,380
I am Groot!

4159
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:11,420
Fucking walled, loser.

4160
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:12,160
Sorry.

4161
02:49:12,860 --> 02:49:13,220
Fucked up.

4162
02:49:13,580 --> 02:49:13,660
Okay.

4163
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:15,540
That was friendly fire.

4164
02:49:15,740 --> 02:49:15,760
Yeah.

4165
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:19,260
That was practicing.

4166
02:49:32,050 --> 02:49:32,610
Hydra.

4167
02:49:33,110 --> 02:49:38,910
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

4168
02:49:39,730 --> 02:49:42,570
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

4169
02:49:43,730 --> 02:49:44,870
A little help, please.

4170
02:49:44,950 --> 02:49:46,810
Today, we fight as allies.

4171
02:49:47,750 --> 02:49:48,350
Do not

4172
02:49:55,760 --> 02:49:56,320
die.

4173
02:49:57,320 --> 02:49:59,580
The Namor is above, on high ground.

4174
02:50:00,500 --> 02:50:01,700
We have Squeezed behind us.

4175
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:08,480
Okay, Starlord down.

4176
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:09,740
Omath, you're dying.

4177
02:50:09,880 --> 02:50:10,660
I'm gonna try to keep you up.

4178
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:12,120
Namor on the right, Namor on the right.

4179
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:12,800
Yeah.

4180
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:14,580
Nice.

4181
02:50:17,660 --> 02:50:18,520
Walking up.

4182
02:50:19,380 --> 02:50:19,680
Yeah.

4183
02:50:22,860 --> 02:50:23,420
Starlord.

4184
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:24,680
Nice.

4185
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:29,540
I need help here.

4186
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:33,500
Okay, we can back up.

4187
02:50:37,420 --> 02:50:38,000
Namor top right.

4188
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:41,560
They're gonna try and do the Namor combo here.

4189
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:43,460
They don't have it, but they'll have it.

4190
02:50:45,960 --> 02:50:46,440
I'm stuck.

4191
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:47,220
Wait, where the fuck am I?

4192
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,180
We have two people on us.

4193
02:50:50,580 --> 02:50:51,860
We need shield for our invis.

4194
02:50:56,120 --> 02:50:56,860
I'm 88.

4195
02:50:57,200 --> 02:50:58,400
I don't know if I can get in time.

4196
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:00,860
I can't get in time.

4197
02:51:04,570 --> 02:51:05,410
I'm 97.

4198
02:51:07,430 --> 02:51:08,270
That is crazy.

4199
02:51:09,250 --> 02:51:09,790
I have ults.

4200
02:51:10,890 --> 02:51:12,050
We can somehow stay alive.

4201
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:13,750
Can you touch?

4202
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:15,430
Oh, good.

4203
02:51:16,270 --> 02:51:17,230
Warm up.

4204
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:19,790
This is warm up for my rank.

4205
02:51:21,630 --> 02:51:22,830
We're ready for day two.

4206
02:51:28,890 --> 02:51:30,770
We're lower bracket now, it's fine.

4207
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:32,010
Oh, true, true.

4208
02:51:32,150 --> 02:51:32,830
This is seeding, right?

4209
02:51:34,410 --> 02:51:38,430
Hey guys, we won $1,000 and that's all that matters.

4210
02:51:40,670 --> 02:51:42,410
We won $1,000 each.

4211
02:51:42,890 --> 02:51:43,370
Yippee!

4212
02:51:43,910 --> 02:51:44,390
Yeah, money!

4213
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:47,550
We're winners.

4214
02:51:49,970 --> 02:51:51,310
Oh, we won!

4215
02:51:52,930 --> 02:51:53,310
Yippee!

4216
02:51:54,030 --> 02:51:54,890
That was a good warm up.

4217
02:51:55,270 --> 02:51:57,570
Dude, at the end there though, I got fucking stuck in a corner.

4218
02:51:57,650 --> 02:51:58,030
I couldn't move.

4219
02:51:58,110 --> 02:51:58,530
I don't know what happened.

4220
02:51:59,430 --> 02:52:00,490
Hey, that's life sometimes.

4221
02:52:00,610 --> 02:52:01,190
It's life.

4222
02:52:01,570 --> 02:52:02,450
That's just life.

4223
02:52:02,930 --> 02:52:06,610
This team scrimmed too, so they were very coordinated because of it.

4224
02:52:07,670 --> 02:52:07,950
Yeah.

4225
02:52:08,830 --> 02:52:09,790
Alright, next time we scrim.

4226
02:52:10,050 --> 02:52:10,410
All good.

4227
02:52:11,330 --> 02:52:11,670
Yeah.

4228
02:52:13,870 --> 02:52:14,830
We run it back.

4229
02:52:16,770 --> 02:52:17,610
GG's, guys.

4230
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:18,970
GG's.

4231
02:52:19,310 --> 02:52:19,830
GG's.

4232
02:52:20,190 --> 02:52:21,250
GG's, everybody.

4233
02:52:21,530 --> 02:52:21,950
Nice playing.

4234
02:52:23,010 --> 02:52:23,650
GG's, guys.

4235
02:52:23,650 --> 02:52:24,710
Nice meeting you guys.

4236
02:52:25,090 --> 02:52:25,130
Yeah.

4237
02:52:25,590 --> 02:52:26,310
Bye-bye.

4238
02:52:26,570 --> 02:52:26,870
Bye.

4239
02:52:27,090 --> 02:52:27,390
Cheers.

4240
02:52:28,130 --> 02:52:29,230
It's okay, guys.

4241
02:52:29,370 --> 02:52:30,430
I had my cope ready.

4242
02:52:31,890 --> 02:52:34,930
I knew going in, I was like, I'm ready to cope.

4243
02:52:34,930 --> 02:52:35,710
I'm...

4244
02:52:39,970 --> 02:52:41,250
It's alright, guys.

4245
02:52:41,370 --> 02:52:48,810
I'm warmed up for rank, but sadly, the group I wanted to play with is still scrimming right now.

4246
02:52:49,290 --> 02:52:50,250
And will not be...

4247
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:50,570
Oh, wait.

4248
02:52:50,810 --> 02:52:51,050
Wait.

4249
02:52:51,830 --> 02:52:52,470
Oh, wait.

4250
02:52:52,810 --> 02:52:53,270
Alright, guys.

4251
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:54,850
Wait, are you going to be finished?

4252
02:52:55,730 --> 02:52:57,930
When we'll finish...

4253
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:00,590
We went 0-7.

4254
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:03,730
I'm warmed up.

4255
02:53:11,150 --> 02:53:12,110
I'm so...

4256
02:53:12,110 --> 02:53:13,950
I'm so warmed up right now.

4257
02:53:15,830 --> 02:53:17,130
It's okay, guys.

4258
02:53:17,290 --> 02:53:20,090
In the end, at least I have this.

4259
02:53:21,210 --> 02:53:22,890
Wait, am I still higher than Hogs?

4260
02:53:23,010 --> 02:53:24,170
Wait, did he play rank?

4261
02:53:24,390 --> 02:53:25,610
There's no fucking way.

4262
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:26,870
Did Hogs play rank?

4263
02:53:27,010 --> 02:53:27,550
Okay, wait.

4264
02:53:29,570 --> 02:53:30,970
No, he fucking lost.

4265
02:53:31,570 --> 02:53:32,290
Oh, nice.

4266
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:33,170
He lost.

4267
02:53:33,290 --> 02:53:33,470
Good.

4268
02:53:33,590 --> 02:53:34,330
As long...

4269
02:53:34,330 --> 02:53:34,730
Good.

4270
02:53:34,810 --> 02:53:38,230
As long as Hogs is not above me, I'm fine with that.

4271
02:53:38,230 --> 02:53:38,750
I...

4272
02:53:42,090 --> 02:53:42,790
It's okay.

4273
02:53:42,970 --> 02:53:43,430
I was...

4274
02:53:43,430 --> 02:53:49,590
I knew going in that it was going to be really rough because we did have someone drop out at the last minute.

4275
02:53:49,870 --> 02:53:54,050
So, I knew going in it was not going to be like...

4276
02:53:54,050 --> 02:53:57,230
Because, like, a Diamond DPS player versus a...

4277
02:53:57,830 --> 02:53:58,610
Not like...

4278
02:53:58,610 --> 02:54:01,490
Because, like, the majority of the DPS players were not the Diamond players.

4279
02:54:01,830 --> 02:54:04,650
Or they were GM or, like, GM and almost Celestial.

4280
02:54:04,650 --> 02:54:06,530
So, I was like...

4281
02:54:06,530 --> 02:54:09,910
I went in knowing that it was going to be very rough.

4282
02:54:10,070 --> 02:54:11,710
So, like, that's why I was like, that's alright.

4283
02:54:16,490 --> 02:54:17,330
And, like...

4284
02:54:18,050 --> 02:54:19,830
And, like, I did get, like...

4285
02:54:19,830 --> 02:54:24,170
I did get a little annoyed at some points because I was getting counter-called.

4286
02:54:24,630 --> 02:54:28,130
And I was just like, we are dying behind us.

4287
02:54:29,190 --> 02:54:30,510
But I was just like, it's okay.

4288
02:54:30,570 --> 02:54:31,490
Everybody is learning.

4289
02:54:32,130 --> 02:54:33,930
Everybody is learning right now.

4290
02:54:33,930 --> 02:54:35,330
Yeah, the Vi...

4291
02:54:35,330 --> 02:54:36,670
Like, I tried.

4292
02:54:41,070 --> 02:54:42,810
I tried my best.

4293
02:54:43,170 --> 02:54:45,010
And at that point, I was like, you IGL.

4294
02:54:47,570 --> 02:54:50,890
I was like, it's not that easy.

4295
02:54:51,090 --> 02:54:53,730
It's not that fun to IGL.

4296
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:57,470
Yeah.

4297
02:54:58,350 --> 02:54:59,330
But it's alright.

4298
02:54:59,690 --> 02:55:00,210
It's okay.

4299
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:01,230
I knew...

4300
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:02,470
No, you can't win every tournament.

4301
02:55:02,470 --> 02:55:03,890
I did my best.

4302
02:55:04,090 --> 02:55:05,970
And then I was just like, play whatever you're comfortable in.

4303
02:55:06,030 --> 02:55:07,810
Because if we try to play meta, it wasn't going to work.

4304
02:55:07,810 --> 02:55:08,670
I knew playing meta...

4305
02:55:10,390 --> 02:55:15,570
I knew playing meta was not going to be it because everybody was stuck in a specific role.

4306
02:55:16,090 --> 02:55:19,390
Other teams could easily go three supports, two tanks.

4307
02:55:19,610 --> 02:55:22,390
But we can't do that because we only have two tank players.

4308
02:55:23,850 --> 02:55:25,650
We only had two tank players.

4309
02:55:26,150 --> 02:55:26,590
So...

4310
02:55:27,150 --> 02:55:29,710
So I was just like, well, we can't go two...

4311
02:55:29,710 --> 02:55:32,990
One, two, three was not going to be it.

4312
02:55:33,270 --> 02:55:35,870
I knew one, two, three was not going to be it.

4313
02:55:36,090 --> 02:55:39,190
Because it's just going to be really rough for the frontline.

4314
02:55:39,410 --> 02:55:44,010
Especially when their main tank player is the actual good tank player.

4315
02:55:44,390 --> 02:55:46,350
It's the actual high ranker.

4316
02:55:46,730 --> 02:55:47,970
So I was like, it's going to be really rough.

4317
02:55:48,390 --> 02:55:51,710
Our one tank was just going to get bullied by their high ranker tank player.

4318
02:55:52,150 --> 02:55:54,130
So we had to run...

4319
02:55:55,650 --> 02:55:58,450
Going three supports is not going to work if we only have one tank.

4320
02:56:00,090 --> 02:56:00,810
And everything.

4321
02:56:01,150 --> 02:56:02,710
And I think we had...

4322
02:56:04,650 --> 02:56:06,570
I just knew it was stacked against me.

4323
02:56:06,750 --> 02:56:08,630
And I went in being like, okay.

4324
02:56:09,650 --> 02:56:11,610
Okay, at least I win a thousand dollars.

4325
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:15,470
Why did you count as pro?

4326
02:56:15,590 --> 02:56:16,150
I don't know.

4327
02:56:16,310 --> 02:56:18,110
I felt like Surefour should have been counted as a pro.

4328
02:56:18,490 --> 02:56:21,430
I know Rivals invited me to do this tournament too.

4329
02:56:21,550 --> 02:56:23,090
I know I said, oh, I want to join.

4330
02:56:23,850 --> 02:56:29,870
But the devs at Marble Rivals personally DMed me asking me to join the Disguised Toast tournament.

4331
02:56:30,310 --> 02:56:31,470
So I was like, all right, cool.

4332
02:56:31,650 --> 02:56:32,370
Okay, I'll try.

4333
02:56:32,510 --> 02:56:33,470
I'll try again.

4334
02:56:33,630 --> 02:56:34,590
And that's why I messaged.

4335
02:56:34,710 --> 02:56:35,610
I was like, yo, can I join in?

4336
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:37,450
Do you still have a spot?

4337
02:56:39,130 --> 02:56:40,910
And so I was just like, I'll fuck it.

4338
02:56:44,670 --> 02:56:45,870
I'll do it again.

4339
02:56:50,270 --> 02:56:50,950
I did.

4340
02:56:50,950 --> 02:56:53,110
I asked to not be put in the pro category.

4341
02:56:53,270 --> 02:56:55,070
I asked to be put in the Celestial category.

4342
02:56:55,870 --> 02:56:58,010
Because I saw who were in the pro categories.

4343
02:56:58,210 --> 02:57:00,430
And I was like, I shouldn't count it as that.

4344
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:01,750
Because I'm a support player.

4345
02:57:02,210 --> 02:57:05,430
And I know Sleepy was in the support pro category.

4346
02:57:05,950 --> 02:57:08,290
But he's literally signed to Envy right now.

4347
02:57:08,370 --> 02:57:09,490
Envy was in Overwatch League.

4348
02:57:11,690 --> 02:57:12,910
But I don't know why.

4349
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:14,690
I think they just want to put my name on there too.

4350
02:57:15,030 --> 02:57:18,330
I think they want to put my name on there just because Marble Rivals invited me to the tournament.

4351
02:57:20,350 --> 02:57:21,590
But it was fine.

4352
02:57:21,710 --> 02:57:22,710
I knew going in.

4353
02:57:22,890 --> 02:57:26,390
That's why I was trying not to be too down about it.

4354
02:57:27,430 --> 02:57:31,510
Obviously, it's hard to pick up the vibes when the vibes were really low already.

4355
02:57:32,090 --> 02:57:35,210
I tried to pick up the vibes, but then the vibes were very low.

4356
02:57:35,330 --> 02:57:36,970
So I was just like, I don't know what to do.

4357
02:57:40,290 --> 02:57:43,130
I was just like, I don't know what to do.

4358
02:57:43,130 --> 02:57:46,970
And some teams did get to pick their teammate.

4359
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:49,110
Get to pick who they wanted to play with and stuff.

4360
02:57:52,930 --> 02:57:57,250
I also think if Wig was there, he would definitely help with the vibes.

4361
02:57:57,490 --> 02:57:59,510
But we made do with what we had.

4362
02:57:59,590 --> 02:58:01,670
It also sucks to be a last minute sub too.

4363
02:58:02,390 --> 02:58:07,530
It also really sucks to be a last minute substitute in a tournament.

4364
02:58:08,110 --> 02:58:11,230
Because obviously, they'll think it's my fault and stuff like that.

4365
02:58:11,230 --> 02:58:15,530
But we literally had to message people.

4366
02:58:18,870 --> 02:58:20,210
Me as well.

4367
02:58:20,610 --> 02:58:22,470
Because I was trying to help Toast find a substitute.

4368
02:58:23,070 --> 02:58:28,030
So me and Toast were trying to find substitutes for one to two hours.

4369
02:58:28,650 --> 02:58:30,230
And it had to be on my team, obviously.

4370
02:58:34,990 --> 02:58:37,730
It had to be my team, obviously.

4371
02:58:38,210 --> 02:58:40,910
I'm just bad luck at that point for Toast tournaments.

4372
02:58:43,250 --> 02:58:44,910
I also didn't research at all.

4373
02:58:45,070 --> 02:58:48,790
I took this one really chill compared to the YouTuber Rivals.

4374
02:58:49,250 --> 02:58:51,970
To be fair, I shouldn't have because this one has more money involved.

4375
02:58:52,310 --> 02:58:53,930
But it's literally $700 more.

4376
02:58:54,190 --> 02:58:55,810
I mean, it's still $700 more.

4377
02:58:56,250 --> 02:58:59,510
But I figured, oh, it's a creator tournament.

4378
02:58:59,710 --> 02:59:03,650
So it's more about having fun with other creators.

4379
02:59:05,530 --> 02:59:06,010
Backline.

4380
02:59:06,090 --> 02:59:08,590
Yeah, the backline was just really rough for the backline.

4381
02:59:08,590 --> 02:59:12,690
Lulu and I called out backline flank all the time.

4382
02:59:14,610 --> 02:59:17,190
I think if we scrimmed, we would definitely have been more coordinated.

4383
02:59:17,350 --> 02:59:22,770
But we just weren't coordinated enough to deal with a backline.

4384
02:59:23,210 --> 02:59:26,030
Because I froze backline.

4385
02:59:26,310 --> 02:59:28,750
And I froze every backline people that came.

4386
02:59:28,830 --> 02:59:34,090
Not everyone, but I tried my best to freeze as many of the people that were trying to get us in the backline.

4387
02:59:34,430 --> 02:59:36,430
And also I called it out multiple times.

4388
02:59:36,430 --> 02:59:41,130
But like, you know, there was just nothing I could do.

4389
02:59:41,590 --> 02:59:42,830
Other than that.

4390
02:59:46,670 --> 02:59:48,930
Yeah, I was just like, I called it out.

4391
02:59:49,330 --> 02:59:51,690
I called it out and I froze them.

4392
02:59:53,190 --> 02:59:55,170
It's not just up to me after that.

4393
02:59:58,650 --> 03:00:01,570
So it's more so of just like, by the way, I'm going to be playing ranked.

4394
03:00:01,710 --> 03:00:03,550
I'm going to be playing ranked just to at least feel something.

4395
03:00:07,370 --> 03:00:08,650
So I'll just do one.

4396
03:00:09,070 --> 03:00:10,230
Fuck yeah, I could lose.

4397
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:12,330
I could be out of top 500.

4398
03:00:14,410 --> 03:00:16,070
I'll just lose a game.

4399
03:00:16,150 --> 03:00:16,910
It's fine.

4400
03:00:19,270 --> 03:00:21,950
I think the Senna and Ulsim are all still scrimming.

4401
03:00:22,110 --> 03:00:26,130
So I can't really grab anybody in the Senna and Ulsim at the moment.

4402
03:00:26,490 --> 03:00:30,490
But we need some form of therapy at the moment.

4403
03:00:30,490 --> 03:00:32,250
We need...

4404
03:00:34,870 --> 03:00:36,930
We need some form...

4405
03:00:36,930 --> 03:00:38,690
I don't mind losing a rank.

4406
03:00:38,830 --> 03:00:40,410
I already lost...

4407
03:00:43,770 --> 03:00:45,090
Trifor only solos.

4408
03:00:45,290 --> 03:00:47,150
He doesn't duo anymore.

4409
03:00:49,570 --> 03:00:51,030
Also, I think he's...

4410
03:00:51,030 --> 03:00:54,070
I think he's just like, he could be doom queuing too.

4411
03:00:56,110 --> 03:00:58,470
He could might as well be doom queuing as well.

4412
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:02,090
I don't see him.

4413
03:01:04,190 --> 03:01:04,770
No,

4414
03:01:08,320 --> 03:01:09,420
I don't want to play quick play.

4415
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:11,020
I just want to doom queue.

4416
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:20,440
I only wanted to be top 500 before the tournament just so I could feel happy about something.

4417
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:22,060
Before the tournament.

4418
03:01:33,240 --> 03:01:34,540
Yeah, it's fine.

4419
03:01:34,700 --> 03:01:35,500
It's alright though.

4420
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:42,560
It's alright.

4421
03:01:49,950 --> 03:01:53,730
I just want to... I just knew going in it was going to be fine.

4422
03:01:54,090 --> 03:01:56,790
I'm trying not to take stuff like this too seriously too.

4423
03:01:59,290 --> 03:02:03,610
Especially when it's a creator cup, I was like, don't take it as seriously.

4424
03:02:03,890 --> 03:02:08,110
I mean, I did stay playing while there was a fucking fire alarm going on.

4425
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:16,620
So I was just like, it's okay.

4426
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:20,660
Wait, what the... Why did it glow?

4427
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:22,560
I'm sad.

4428
03:02:22,660 --> 03:02:24,980
I'm sad that the Loki costume isn't out yet.

4429
03:02:25,120 --> 03:02:27,100
That was going to be the first thing I spend money on.

4430
03:02:27,440 --> 03:02:34,400
I didn't like any costumes other than... I think President Loki is actually like...

4431
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:38,540
President Loki was like the one costume I actually liked.

4432
03:02:41,380 --> 03:02:42,760
Thank God it was a drill.

4433
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:49,980
Thank God.

4434
03:02:51,580 --> 03:02:53,760
Thank God it was a drill.

4435
03:03:01,740 --> 03:03:03,340
Yeah, mentally support wise.

4436
03:03:07,510 --> 03:03:08,230
Alright.

4437
03:03:09,490 --> 03:03:10,950
We go in.

4438
03:03:11,490 --> 03:03:12,830
If we lose, it's okay.

4439
03:03:12,890 --> 03:03:13,990
I'm already used to it.

4440
03:03:15,730 --> 03:03:16,370
I'm ready.

4441
03:03:18,590 --> 03:03:19,790
I'm ready.

4442
03:03:20,350 --> 03:03:22,070
What's another... What's OA?

4443
03:03:22,070 --> 03:03:22,890
You know?

4444
03:03:24,290 --> 03:03:26,350
We're Doom queuing right now.

4445
03:03:27,170 --> 03:03:29,910
What's wrong with an OA, you know?

4446
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:38,910
Oh no, I was banned Namor.

4447
03:03:41,270 --> 03:03:43,850
My go-to banline is Namor Groot.

4448
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:46,370
I fucking hate... You guys can swear at me.

4449
03:03:46,390 --> 03:03:47,070
I don't care.

4450
03:03:47,150 --> 03:03:48,210
I don't care about Hela.

4451
03:03:48,310 --> 03:03:49,030
Fuck, okay.

4452
03:03:49,090 --> 03:03:50,310
I guess I don't want to play against Hela.

4453
03:03:50,510 --> 03:03:53,050
I personally just do not want to play against Namor.

4454
03:03:53,290 --> 03:03:53,770
Whoops, sorry.

4455
03:03:53,850 --> 03:03:53,990
Oh.

4456
03:03:54,670 --> 03:03:56,590
We'll ban Hela next.

4457
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:59,190
I don't mind.

4458
03:03:59,390 --> 03:04:00,090
We can ban Hela.

4459
03:04:01,050 --> 03:04:02,450
They banned Groot, so that's fine.

4460
03:04:02,970 --> 03:04:05,230
I've never... That's my go-to banline.

4461
03:04:05,350 --> 03:04:10,270
I always just ban Namor Groot because Namor is such a clutch character.

4462
03:04:12,390 --> 03:04:16,490
Hela I'm not that scared of versus Namor Groot because Hela is just like one person.

4463
03:04:16,830 --> 03:04:20,430
But Namor Groot is like just fucking...

4464
03:04:20,990 --> 03:04:21,350
Cancer.

4465
03:04:24,270 --> 03:04:25,190
Sorry, I'm going.

4466
03:04:26,170 --> 03:04:29,770
Also, if you guys want to know who's on streamer mode, you can literally go look here.

4467
03:04:29,970 --> 03:04:31,010
I figured this out.

4468
03:04:31,110 --> 03:04:34,470
If you're on streamer mode, you can see who's on your team by just looking up here.

4469
03:04:36,210 --> 03:04:36,710
I don't know.

4470
03:04:36,790 --> 03:04:37,850
Maybe we have a Spider-Man player.

4471
03:04:38,270 --> 03:04:38,750
I'm looking.

4472
03:04:38,890 --> 03:04:40,070
I don't know any of these people.

4473
03:04:41,350 --> 03:04:43,450
That's like a little hack.

4474
03:04:47,990 --> 03:04:49,090
That I found out.

4475
03:04:53,500 --> 03:04:54,760
What's the point of streamer mode?

4476
03:04:54,880 --> 03:04:57,040
The enemy team can't see what you are.

4477
03:04:57,900 --> 03:04:58,580
That's the point.

4478
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:02,480
It's more about the enemy team.

4479
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:05,560
But I get to see who's on my team, which is fine.

4480
03:05:07,500 --> 03:05:09,360
I just want to know who's on my team.

4481
03:05:12,770 --> 03:05:13,670
Which is okay.

4482
03:05:15,730 --> 03:05:17,110
Toki, it's a feature.

4483
03:05:17,410 --> 03:05:19,110
I don't think that was supposed to be intentional.

4484
03:05:19,590 --> 03:05:21,510
I don't think you're supposed to know who's on your team.

4485
03:05:23,850 --> 03:05:26,450
Yeah, the reason why I was like...

4486
03:05:27,590 --> 03:05:29,470
Namor is way too easy to play.

4487
03:05:32,790 --> 03:05:37,950
Because he's just way too good for how easy his util is.

4488
03:05:39,330 --> 03:05:41,110
I mean, Bucky is really good too.

4489
03:05:41,250 --> 03:05:42,670
But only when you're in higher ELO.

4490
03:05:43,290 --> 03:05:44,050
I feel like.

4491
03:05:49,400 --> 03:05:49,680
See?

4492
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:50,340
Look at that.

4493
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:51,440
Go, Bucky, go!

4494
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:55,380
Go, Bucky, go!

4495
03:06:08,900 --> 03:06:09,460
Yay!

4496
03:06:09,980 --> 03:06:11,300
Go, Bucky, go!

4497
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:13,160
Oh, goodbye.

4498
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:17,500
Oh, I want to back out a little bit.

4499
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:18,380
No, goodbye.

4500
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:22,160
Okay, people were a little too aggressive there.

4501
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:24,900
I should have said something.

4502
03:06:29,510 --> 03:06:31,890
People were a little too aggressive.

4503
03:06:32,310 --> 03:06:32,630
Woah!

4504
03:06:35,970 --> 03:06:36,410
Oh.

4505
03:06:37,150 --> 03:06:37,930
You're topping off?

4506
03:06:38,170 --> 03:06:38,390
Thank you.

4507
03:06:41,090 --> 03:06:42,450
I have a Starlord behind.

4508
03:06:45,070 --> 03:06:45,850
Any help?

4509
03:06:46,610 --> 03:06:47,090
Oh.

4510
03:06:49,790 --> 03:06:50,810
I'm really low.

4511
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:02,320
I don't have vault for this.

4512
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:05,520
Oh!

4513
03:07:08,320 --> 03:07:08,800
No!

4514
03:07:14,350 --> 03:07:16,030
Uh, let's see.

4515
03:07:17,170 --> 03:07:18,550
Oh wait, if you want mag back, I can swap.

4516
03:07:18,650 --> 03:07:18,810
Sorry.

4517
03:07:20,170 --> 03:07:20,810
No, it's good.

4518
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:21,110
It's good.

4519
03:07:21,670 --> 03:07:21,910
Okay.

4520
03:07:22,730 --> 03:07:23,090
I'll stay.

4521
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:24,950
Oh, I can ult first.

4522
03:07:48,110 --> 03:07:48,530
Melting.

4523
03:07:53,370 --> 03:07:54,290
I'm moving up.

4524
03:07:57,150 --> 03:07:59,290
4, 3, 2, 1.

4525
03:08:00,130 --> 03:08:01,950
I'm going to use my ult for Starlord ult.

4526
03:08:02,790 --> 03:08:03,590
Uh, mag for Starlord.

4527
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:07,990
There's, uh, magic on us.

4528
03:08:08,290 --> 03:08:09,010
Magic can die in the back.

4529
03:08:09,090 --> 03:08:09,310
1 HP.

4530
03:08:12,090 --> 03:08:12,890
I'm reloading.

4531
03:08:13,470 --> 03:08:15,690
Here, Adam flanking top right on our BP.

4532
03:08:16,390 --> 03:08:17,190
Oh, I don't have ult yet.

4533
03:08:20,570 --> 03:08:21,790
I can bubble you in 3 seconds.

4534
03:08:22,050 --> 03:08:22,490
You'll be fine.

4535
03:08:23,550 --> 03:08:24,630
Oh my god!

4536
03:08:25,130 --> 03:08:25,630
He's behind us.

4537
03:08:27,590 --> 03:08:28,110
Mag low!

4538
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:28,490
Mag low!

4539
03:08:29,630 --> 03:08:30,490
They wasted that.

4540
03:08:33,710 --> 03:08:34,790
They're rezzing behind us.

4541
03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:35,430
Yeah, they're rezzing here.

4542
03:08:35,730 --> 03:08:35,850
Ult first range.

4543
03:08:35,930 --> 03:08:36,330
Ult first range.

4544
03:08:45,240 --> 03:08:46,140
Help our back up again.

4545
03:08:46,260 --> 03:08:47,380
Oh, shit.

4546
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:49,960
Magic on me.

4547
03:08:50,040 --> 03:08:50,420
Magic on me.

4548
03:08:51,560 --> 03:08:52,000
Magic low.

4549
03:08:52,120 --> 03:08:52,540
Magic low.

4550
03:08:54,320 --> 03:08:54,780
She's dead.

4551
03:08:55,980 --> 03:08:56,540
Mag half.

4552
03:08:56,960 --> 03:08:57,420
Mag can die.

4553
03:08:57,480 --> 03:08:57,800
Mag can die.

4554
03:08:57,840 --> 03:08:58,460
I'm fucking mag.

4555
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:00,620
Starlord half.

4556
03:09:00,820 --> 03:09:01,220
Starlord... oh.

4557
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:03,440
He has one more jump.

4558
03:09:09,830 --> 03:09:11,070
He has Starlord ult here.

4559
03:09:12,010 --> 03:09:13,590
Yeah, I'll hold for it this time.

4560
03:09:13,790 --> 03:09:15,590
We have to, like, melt him though because mine doesn't last as long.

4561
03:09:15,810 --> 03:09:16,490
Help first range.

4562
03:09:16,550 --> 03:09:17,090
Help first range.

4563
03:09:19,610 --> 03:09:20,750
I can't get to you, Bucky.

4564
03:09:22,050 --> 03:09:22,590
I'll ult it.

4565
03:09:22,630 --> 03:09:23,030
Just kill him.

4566
03:09:23,870 --> 03:09:24,730
He got bubble.

4567
03:09:29,850 --> 03:09:30,210
Nice.

4568
03:09:30,770 --> 03:09:31,170
No more ults.

4569
03:09:31,210 --> 03:09:31,610
No more ults.

4570
03:09:31,990 --> 03:09:32,850
They can both cocoon.

4571
03:09:34,170 --> 03:09:35,390
2, 1, 0.

4572
03:09:36,850 --> 03:09:37,630
We should walk them.

4573
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:38,370
They canceled cocoon.

4574
03:09:40,810 --> 03:09:41,630
Magic is in.

4575
03:09:44,710 --> 03:09:45,610
They are full now.

4576
03:09:47,550 --> 03:09:48,190
They used link.

4577
03:09:48,250 --> 03:09:48,570
They used link.

4578
03:09:48,670 --> 03:09:48,950
Kite back.

4579
03:09:50,150 --> 03:09:51,010
We need help.

4580
03:09:51,090 --> 03:09:51,450
We need help.

4581
03:09:52,550 --> 03:09:53,470
I'm backing out.

4582
03:09:53,530 --> 03:09:53,930
I'm backing out.

4583
03:09:58,810 --> 03:10:03,930
Starlord behind us.

4584
03:10:04,030 --> 03:10:04,470
Starlord behind.

4585
03:10:07,310 --> 03:10:08,130
We got mag.

4586
03:10:09,110 --> 03:10:09,650
Mag half.

4587
03:10:16,730 --> 03:10:17,990
I have bubble.

4588
03:10:29,070 --> 03:10:30,230
I have magic on me.

4589
03:10:30,510 --> 03:10:31,090
I might be dead.

4590
03:10:32,390 --> 03:10:33,090
I'm dead.

4591
03:10:36,110 --> 03:10:36,590
Magic 1.

4592
03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:36,970
Magic 1.

4593
03:10:37,750 --> 03:10:39,050
You have no supports.

4594
03:10:48,580 --> 03:10:50,480
I'm coming back.

4595
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:52,360
I can try to touch.

4596
03:10:55,200 --> 03:10:55,560
I have ult.

4597
03:10:55,620 --> 03:10:55,780
I have ult.

4598
03:11:01,310 --> 03:11:02,770
Did you use both DPS ults?

4599
03:11:02,890 --> 03:11:03,010
They're good.

4600
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:03,010
They're good.

4601
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:03,830
We're going to be close to mantis.

4602
03:11:06,070 --> 03:11:07,350
3, 2, 1.

4603
03:11:07,430 --> 03:11:07,930
Backing out.

4604
03:11:08,530 --> 03:11:09,050
I froze mag.

4605
03:11:14,200 --> 03:11:15,280
I hear someone up here.

4606
03:11:16,940 --> 03:11:17,820
It's starlord, right?

4607
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:18,860
Starlord, Resi.

4608
03:11:20,040 --> 03:11:21,640
It's close left in the bottom left room.

4609
03:11:27,390 --> 03:11:28,270
Look at the mantis if you can.

4610
03:11:30,430 --> 03:11:31,210
Help our tanks.

4611
03:11:32,390 --> 03:11:33,750
We have magic on point.

4612
03:11:34,170 --> 03:11:34,830
They have no heals.

4613
03:11:35,130 --> 03:11:35,690
They only have items.

4614
03:11:35,870 --> 03:11:36,510
Actually, yeah, they're all dead.

4615
03:11:36,870 --> 03:11:37,610
They have one more touch.

4616
03:11:37,610 --> 03:11:39,050
Can you try to counter portal?

4617
03:11:40,870 --> 03:11:41,670
Do you know how to do it?

4618
03:11:41,870 --> 03:11:42,330
Okay, nice.

4619
03:11:48,290 --> 03:11:49,150
They're not portaling.

4620
03:11:49,290 --> 03:11:49,730
They're not portaling.

4621
03:11:49,850 --> 03:11:50,190
They're just walking.

4622
03:11:58,080 --> 03:11:58,800
Magic's coming in.

4623
03:11:59,100 --> 03:12:00,120
Use mantis to touch.

4624
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:02,280
She can die.

4625
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:03,020
She's kind of running in.

4626
03:12:05,720 --> 03:12:07,380
They're going to have invisible when ult after this turn.

4627
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:08,380
Magic on me.

4628
03:12:08,560 --> 03:12:09,040
I froze her.

4629
03:12:14,270 --> 03:12:15,370
I don't have bubble.

4630
03:12:15,450 --> 03:12:15,750
No bubble.

4631
03:12:17,930 --> 03:12:18,610
Nice.

4632
03:12:20,210 --> 03:12:25,290
If we can live for 10, I have...

4633
03:12:25,290 --> 03:12:27,690
Oh, I got magicked.

4634
03:12:31,490 --> 03:12:32,550
That's unlucky.

4635
03:12:40,840 --> 03:12:43,120
That's unlucky that magic got me.

4636
03:12:43,860 --> 03:12:44,760
They used everything.

4637
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:48,780
They're running triple support.

4638
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:49,000
Okay.

4639
03:12:58,180 --> 03:13:00,320
They're going to have like 50% Adam.

4640
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:16,360
We're up one for now.

4641
03:13:19,140 --> 03:13:19,940
I'm asleep.

4642
03:13:37,780 --> 03:13:38,500
BORN AGAIN!

4643
03:13:38,740 --> 03:13:39,400
To the right side.

4644
03:13:39,480 --> 03:13:39,700
Right room.

4645
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:40,020
Right room.

4646
03:13:40,540 --> 03:13:41,620
I don't think we should push that.

4647
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:42,220
Okay.

4648
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:47,280
They used soulbond already.

4649
03:13:48,220 --> 03:13:49,580
They're going to be close to mantis.

4650
03:13:52,260 --> 03:13:53,380
They have magical here.

4651
03:13:54,740 --> 03:13:56,340
I don't have my ult for starlord yet.

4652
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:01,060
We got a hook.

4653
03:14:01,440 --> 03:14:03,280
We have to kite this.

4654
03:14:03,360 --> 03:14:03,700
We have to kite this.

4655
03:14:04,460 --> 03:14:05,940
We kind of need to save for starlord ult.

4656
03:14:06,520 --> 03:14:07,520
Yeah, I'm saving mine.

4657
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:09,400
Actually, I'm almost there.

4658
03:14:09,440 --> 03:14:09,860
I might have it.

4659
03:14:13,760 --> 03:14:15,100
Can you top me off real quick?

4660
03:14:15,140 --> 03:14:15,200
Okay, I have.

4661
03:14:15,300 --> 03:14:15,460
I have.

4662
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:16,240
I'll use ult starlord.

4663
03:14:25,380 --> 03:14:25,940
I'll ult first.

4664
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:26,400
I'll ult first.

4665
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:27,880
He's flanking starlord top left.

4666
03:14:27,880 --> 03:14:28,180
I got it.

4667
03:14:28,220 --> 03:14:28,480
I got it.

4668
03:14:31,160 --> 03:14:31,900
They used soulbond.

4669
03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:38,960
4, 3, 2, 1.

4670
03:14:41,360 --> 03:14:42,100
I'm on my ult.

4671
03:14:44,680 --> 03:14:45,400
This is the last fight.

4672
03:14:45,440 --> 03:14:45,840
Last fight.

4673
03:14:45,840 --> 03:14:47,220
I froze mag.

4674
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:47,880
I froze mag.

4675
03:14:49,420 --> 03:14:50,840
I'm on mantis ult.

4676
03:14:55,000 --> 03:15:01,000
Mag on point.

4677
03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:01,620
Mag on point.

4678
03:15:03,240 --> 03:15:03,780
Mag half.

4679
03:15:03,900 --> 03:15:04,300
Mag half.

4680
03:15:04,420 --> 03:15:04,820
Mag half.

4681
03:15:04,820 --> 03:15:06,060
We're killing their entire backline.

4682
03:15:18,480 --> 03:15:20,460
There's only one good magic player.

4683
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:22,180
Two good magic players.

4684
03:15:24,180 --> 03:15:25,680
In high elo.

4685
03:15:25,900 --> 03:15:26,560
In one above all.

4686
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:28,340
It's Azula.

4687
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,560
But the thing is, she only plays magic.

4688
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:33,380
So are you target banned?

4689
03:15:34,960 --> 03:15:36,460
Do you want to go mag?

4690
03:15:36,660 --> 03:15:37,920
It's like good into the starlord matchup.

4691
03:15:37,940 --> 03:15:42,620
If you target ban Azula, she can play other characters.

4692
03:15:43,160 --> 03:15:49,160
But obviously, it's sort of a nerf on their team if she's not on magic.

4693
03:15:49,500 --> 03:15:55,560
If she's put on any other character, it's like we rather her be on magic.

4694
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:03,280
I might be just very unlucky whenever I have her.

4695
03:16:03,280 --> 03:16:09,460
But whenever I have her and magic is banned, I'm yet to win with her when she can't play magic.

4696
03:16:12,400 --> 03:16:14,100
And the other one is Ry.

4697
03:16:15,320 --> 03:16:17,820
Ry is known as the best pro magic player.

4698
03:16:18,860 --> 03:16:20,640
Pro player that's a magic player.

4699
03:16:22,760 --> 03:16:26,020
There's only two good magic players that I know in this elo.

4700
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:32,400
And Ry is like the best pro player that plays magic.

4701
03:16:33,280 --> 03:16:36,900
Azula is the best rank grinder magic player.

4702
03:16:40,420 --> 03:16:41,100
They are.

4703
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:42,680
She was streamer mode.

4704
03:16:42,820 --> 03:16:43,620
You just can't see it.

4705
03:16:45,360 --> 03:16:51,260
You can't see it when... it's streamer mode until like 50% of the game.

4706
03:16:52,900 --> 03:16:54,240
I'm going to put us on this high ground with Aluna.

4707
03:16:54,300 --> 03:16:55,100
Maybe we can one shot her.

4708
03:16:56,400 --> 03:16:57,160
Right in front of us.

4709
03:16:57,380 --> 03:16:58,160
She dropped into arcade.

4710
03:16:58,240 --> 03:16:58,800
I'm going to follow her.

4711
03:17:05,800 --> 03:17:06,800
Aluna is like full 1 HP.

4712
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:07,580
I can try to chase.

4713
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:10,460
All their healers are in this corner.

4714
03:17:12,320 --> 03:17:13,000
I'm 1 HP.

4715
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:17,760
And you have no supports.

4716
03:17:17,980 --> 03:17:19,140
I'm kind of a bad support, I bet.

4717
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:26,760
Wait,

4718
03:17:31,610 --> 03:17:32,430
Panther, can you peek me?

4719
03:17:33,010 --> 03:17:33,690
Okay, I got you.

4720
03:17:44,710 --> 03:17:45,770
I just got here.

4721
03:17:45,850 --> 03:17:46,670
How's everything going?

4722
03:17:46,930 --> 03:17:48,590
I'm coping by playing rank right now.

4723
03:17:48,730 --> 03:17:50,090
That's sort of how I'm going.

4724
03:17:59,070 --> 03:18:00,330
I might need heals.

4725
03:18:03,590 --> 03:18:05,170
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky one!

4726
03:18:06,370 --> 03:18:07,150
He got bubbled.

4727
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:12,080
We're up in healer.

4728
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:13,840
Look at their Bucky on point.

4729
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:16,200
Oh, shit.

4730
03:18:16,320 --> 03:18:17,360
I can't see you, you're in invis.

4731
03:18:19,320 --> 03:18:19,820
I'm up.

4732
03:18:21,540 --> 03:18:21,960
Oh, we have Loki.

4733
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:24,520
Kill the Bucky, kill the Bucky.

4734
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:27,580
Oh my god, they're... No!

4735
03:18:28,680 --> 03:18:29,620
I got subbed.

4736
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:32,440
Oh my god, mag Bucky ulted.

4737
03:18:32,940 --> 03:18:34,340
You don't have Luna heals.

4738
03:18:37,100 --> 03:18:39,900
I come back, we will... Oh no, nevermind, we don't need it.

4739
03:18:41,320 --> 03:18:43,220
Adam's gonna ult, I'll try to stun him out of it.

4740
03:18:43,540 --> 03:18:44,900
I'm coming back, we will...

4741
03:18:55,930 --> 03:18:56,410
Mag?

4742
03:18:57,910 --> 03:18:59,410
Two, one, zero.

4743
03:19:00,910 --> 03:19:02,090
I can't, I'm sorry.

4744
03:19:09,730 --> 03:19:11,170
I can't see you, Panther.

4745
03:19:16,260 --> 03:19:17,200
They're not portaling.

4746
03:19:23,440 --> 03:19:23,840
Nice.

4747
03:19:26,600 --> 03:19:27,840
Did they use Luna ult there?

4748
03:19:29,080 --> 03:19:30,720
No, he has Luna ult.

4749
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:33,660
Okay, they're probably close to him just then.

4750
03:19:35,320 --> 03:19:36,340
Did they use Adam?

4751
03:19:37,580 --> 03:19:38,820
No, he died before he could.

4752
03:19:39,060 --> 03:19:40,240
Okay, so he still has it.

4753
03:19:40,600 --> 03:19:41,400
I'm pushing cart.

4754
03:19:43,560 --> 03:19:44,540
We got a huge hook.

4755
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:49,980
Loki's healing, I'm pushing cart.

4756
03:19:50,800 --> 03:19:51,120
Okay.

4757
03:19:52,480 --> 03:19:53,260
You guys should swap.

4758
03:19:54,240 --> 03:19:54,560
Okay.

4759
03:19:57,180 --> 03:19:57,680
Mag, look.

4760
03:20:06,510 --> 03:20:07,770
Look to bubble your Tracer.

4761
03:20:08,070 --> 03:20:08,950
Do you have bubble?

4762
03:20:13,770 --> 03:20:15,130
Oh, bubble me now, bubble me now.

4763
03:20:15,330 --> 03:20:15,910
As soon as you can see me.

4764
03:20:17,670 --> 03:20:18,790
Scott, ult him in the back.

4765
03:20:21,590 --> 03:20:22,470
Nice heal, nice heal.

4766
03:20:25,670 --> 03:20:26,750
How long till it ends?

4767
03:20:28,710 --> 03:20:30,090
We don't need yet, we don't need yet.

4768
03:20:31,930 --> 03:20:34,930
We're doing this, they're gonna rez that probably.

4769
03:20:39,910 --> 03:20:40,870
I'm pushing for it.

4770
03:20:42,030 --> 03:20:44,670
Adam, Adam, Adam in here, Adam in here.

4771
03:20:44,990 --> 03:20:45,510
Oh, in the room?

4772
03:20:45,610 --> 03:20:45,710
Okay.

4773
03:20:46,210 --> 03:20:48,250
Oh, sorry, I thought I was in.

4774
03:20:49,030 --> 03:20:49,950
Kill the Mag, kill the Mag.

4775
03:20:50,130 --> 03:20:50,670
That was my bad.

4776
03:20:57,020 --> 03:20:58,100
Sorry, that was my bad.

4777
03:20:58,180 --> 03:20:59,040
Bad call from me.

4778
03:20:59,280 --> 03:20:59,900
That's okay, that's okay.

4779
03:20:59,960 --> 03:21:01,000
I mean, I don't think we're making it up anyways.

4780
03:21:01,800 --> 03:21:06,120
They used Luna, Adam, Starlord, Mag, Bucky, Invis.

4781
03:21:06,240 --> 03:21:07,380
They're gonna be close to Invis first.

4782
03:21:13,980 --> 03:21:15,240
Actually, they probably have Mag.

4783
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:24,780
I'm gonna ask for bubble again when I go for ult.

4784
03:21:24,940 --> 03:21:25,840
Because they can push me away.

4785
03:21:25,940 --> 03:21:26,100
Alright.

4786
03:21:27,920 --> 03:21:28,720
He's hooking Karen.

4787
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:35,280
Let's drop main, this building is kind of hard.

4788
03:21:39,660 --> 03:21:40,340
We're back, Bucky.

4789
03:21:42,520 --> 03:21:43,240
Oh, shit.

4790
03:21:44,880 --> 03:21:46,040
We have Immo just.

4791
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:48,760
We kind of can't tower down here right now.

4792
03:21:49,300 --> 03:21:49,900
We have no DPS.

4793
03:21:58,090 --> 03:21:59,270
Hey, Bucky can ult first.

4794
03:21:59,410 --> 03:21:59,770
He's hooking Karen.

4795
03:22:01,910 --> 03:22:02,510
He missed.

4796
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:06,660
Okay, I'm looking for ult.

4797
03:22:07,380 --> 03:22:08,440
Actually, no I'm not.

4798
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:09,100
I don't want to.

4799
03:22:09,260 --> 03:22:18,880
I hear someone to my left.

4800
03:22:19,060 --> 03:22:19,560
I don't know who.

4801
03:22:20,720 --> 03:22:21,080
Starlord.

4802
03:22:22,660 --> 03:22:23,020
Nice.

4803
03:22:23,960 --> 03:22:24,800
Okay, they matched.

4804
03:22:25,100 --> 03:22:26,100
Ours lasts a little longer.

4805
03:22:26,680 --> 03:22:27,920
I'm gonna look for a strange ult to get out of this.

4806
03:22:37,700 --> 03:22:39,020
There's a mag above us.

4807
03:22:39,300 --> 03:22:39,700
He's one.

4808
03:22:39,940 --> 03:22:40,340
He's low.

4809
03:22:41,280 --> 03:22:41,860
He's still low.

4810
03:22:42,660 --> 03:22:43,520
He's getting rezzed, Karen.

4811
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:46,100
Three people got rezzed.

4812
03:22:46,520 --> 03:22:47,520
I have ult on that.

4813
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:48,080
I got him.

4814
03:22:48,200 --> 03:22:49,040
Kill the Starlord if you can.

4815
03:22:49,740 --> 03:22:50,240
Starlord's low.

4816
03:22:50,360 --> 03:22:51,160
Starlord's still low.

4817
03:22:52,500 --> 03:22:53,040
Do you have bubble right now?

4818
03:22:53,900 --> 03:22:55,160
Bubble your strange right now if you have it.

4819
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:00,880
Killed one healing.

4820
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:02,720
I'm blocking heals with Bucky.

4821
03:23:02,860 --> 03:23:03,260
Kill the Bucky.

4822
03:23:03,360 --> 03:23:03,920
I'm blocking heals with him.

4823
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:05,280
Do you have bubble?

4824
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:07,960
No.

4825
03:23:09,460 --> 03:23:10,620
That might not be optimal.

4826
03:23:17,300 --> 03:23:18,020
That's unlucky.

4827
03:23:21,380 --> 03:23:22,100
That's unlucky.

4828
03:23:22,360 --> 03:23:23,140
We just didn't have bubble.

4829
03:23:25,320 --> 03:23:27,620
They went triple support, so there was nothing we could do.

4830
03:23:32,910 --> 03:23:34,430
It was a good fight, though.

4831
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:35,770
It was actually a good game.

4832
03:23:35,950 --> 03:23:37,510
I like that the game was decent.

4833
03:23:39,610 --> 03:23:41,150
Yeah, it was a good game.

4834
03:23:41,470 --> 03:23:46,590
It was just unlucky that they went triple support, so they just had more sustainability there.

4835
03:23:48,210 --> 03:23:48,790
That's fine.

4836
03:23:49,770 --> 03:23:51,590
Yeah, actually, the team was decent.

4837
03:23:51,810 --> 03:23:52,770
We had a decent team.

4838
03:23:53,790 --> 03:23:54,510
And both...

4839
03:23:54,510 --> 03:23:55,570
Oh shit, what time is it?

4840
03:23:55,830 --> 03:23:56,970
Okay, I was gonna say...

4841
03:23:59,230 --> 03:24:02,130
Yeah, like, that was actually a really good game.

4842
03:24:02,270 --> 03:24:04,410
Like, I actually enjoyed that game.

4843
03:24:06,950 --> 03:24:07,510
No.

4844
03:24:09,830 --> 03:24:10,350
No.

4845
03:24:11,070 --> 03:24:11,390
No.

4846
03:24:11,990 --> 03:24:12,410
It's not...

4847
03:24:12,410 --> 03:24:13,650
It's not food time.

4848
03:24:15,110 --> 03:24:15,390
Yeah.

4849
03:24:17,650 --> 03:24:19,130
Yeah, they're still scrimming.

4850
03:24:19,210 --> 03:24:22,130
They don't end until 30 minutes, so I'll just wait.

4851
03:24:22,290 --> 03:24:23,550
I'll just keep playing until then.

4852
03:24:25,230 --> 03:24:27,630
But the games were actually pretty decent.

4853
03:24:31,110 --> 03:24:31,830
Tournament's over.

4854
03:24:31,950 --> 03:24:33,130
Okay, tournament is over.

4855
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:33,990
I play ranked.

4856
03:24:40,310 --> 03:24:46,170
I made a bad call about the rez there, but I don't think it would have mattered anyway.

4857
03:24:47,150 --> 03:24:48,190
I thought he was below.

4858
03:24:51,250 --> 03:24:52,470
No, Adam's good.

4859
03:24:52,490 --> 03:24:53,890
Adam's good if he has triple support.

4860
03:24:54,010 --> 03:24:54,730
You go...

4861
03:24:54,730 --> 03:24:56,250
The thing is, they had Adam Mantis.

4862
03:24:56,410 --> 03:24:56,810
They had Adam...

4863
03:24:58,670 --> 03:25:00,650
Adam Starlord, so they had double rez.

4864
03:25:02,270 --> 03:25:03,430
So I had to...

4865
03:25:03,430 --> 03:25:08,550
I thought it was bottom because he did bottom last time, but he, like, actually juked it and everything.

4866
03:25:10,170 --> 03:25:10,890
I don't know.

4867
03:25:10,970 --> 03:25:12,870
I don't know if I called the correct...

4868
03:25:13,310 --> 03:25:14,470
The correct rez.

4869
03:25:16,570 --> 03:25:17,950
Yeah, it was hard to kill everything.

4870
03:25:18,190 --> 03:25:20,990
Like, I used my Luna ult when I had...

4871
03:25:20,990 --> 03:25:23,130
Well, like, basically I had to use it during the Bucky ult and everything.

4872
03:25:28,040 --> 03:25:31,960
I mean, if I really want to cheese it, I just remember their banner.

4873
03:25:32,860 --> 03:25:33,820
This is how people do.

4874
03:25:34,420 --> 03:25:35,480
And they know they have a one trick.

4875
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:37,180
If I say level 55...

4876
03:25:37,180 --> 03:25:39,080
Level 55...

4877
03:25:39,080 --> 03:25:43,520
Because Azula is always on streamer mode because she doesn't want to get her magic ban.

4878
03:25:44,020 --> 03:25:45,180
This is what people do in higher elo.

4879
03:25:45,800 --> 03:25:51,060
They recognize their banner, and then they recognize the level 55, and then they just target banner.

4880
03:25:51,780 --> 03:25:52,600
That's all the pro...

4881
03:25:52,600 --> 03:25:54,940
What all the high elo pro players do.

4882
03:25:55,140 --> 03:25:55,580
They...

4883
03:25:55,580 --> 03:25:56,860
Like, it's crazy.

4884
03:25:56,860 --> 03:26:00,060
Apparently, a lot of pro players, they have a list.

4885
03:26:00,520 --> 03:26:01,440
They write down.

4886
03:26:01,660 --> 03:26:02,200
They like...

4887
03:26:02,200 --> 03:26:08,340
After, like, during ranked games, they actually, like, write down, like, what their banners are.

4888
03:26:08,700 --> 03:26:09,900
And what level they are.

4889
03:26:10,380 --> 03:26:15,660
So, like, they can target ban them to specifically make the games easier for themselves.

4890
03:26:16,540 --> 03:26:17,700
Because, like, I know this.

4891
03:26:17,860 --> 03:26:21,840
Because while I was playing with some of them, they'd be like, let me look at my list.

4892
03:26:28,220 --> 03:26:31,380
They, like, actually, like, write down, like, who they're playing.

4893
03:26:31,500 --> 03:26:33,460
Like, if they know they're playing against a one trick.

4894
03:26:33,780 --> 03:26:35,640
So, if I see...

4895
03:26:36,220 --> 03:26:36,620
Level...

4896
03:26:36,620 --> 03:26:37,340
Oh, wait.

4897
03:26:37,800 --> 03:26:38,780
Wait, there's another level 55.

4898
03:26:38,940 --> 03:26:40,800
Oh, we have the magic player on my team.

4899
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:43,520
The magic player is on my team now.

4900
03:26:45,340 --> 03:26:46,060
There you go.

4901
03:26:46,160 --> 03:26:47,740
Level 55, magic banner.

4902
03:26:48,160 --> 03:26:49,920
I was like, wait, there's two magic banners.

4903
03:26:51,280 --> 03:26:52,000
Oh, no.

4904
03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:54,560
This better be Jesse.

4905
03:26:54,560 --> 03:26:57,400
Jesse is the only Jeff I trust.

4906
03:26:58,720 --> 03:26:59,840
About Namor group.

4907
03:27:01,540 --> 03:27:04,540
God, I hope they don't target ban my magic player.

4908
03:27:05,020 --> 03:27:06,080
Oh, my God.

4909
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:09,480
I hope they don't fucking remember the level and the banner.

4910
03:27:13,340 --> 03:27:14,320
Oh, we're doing Adam?

4911
03:27:15,100 --> 03:27:15,460
Okay.

4912
03:27:23,620 --> 03:27:24,220
Alright.

4913
03:27:24,520 --> 03:27:25,700
Yay, Namor.

4914
03:27:25,980 --> 03:27:27,020
Yay, get him out.

4915
03:27:27,140 --> 03:27:27,960
Get him out.

4916
03:27:28,080 --> 03:27:29,280
Get him out of there.

4917
03:27:30,960 --> 03:27:31,500
Leave.

4918
03:27:34,660 --> 03:27:36,500
Leave my game.

4919
03:27:38,520 --> 03:27:39,500
I have not...

4920
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:40,860
Every time I play with...

4921
03:27:40,860 --> 03:27:42,380
Every time I...

4922
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:47,940
Every time I've like...

4923
03:27:47,940 --> 03:27:51,600
Had a game where Namor and group passes through, I've never won.

4924
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:54,820
That any team would just somehow have a better Namor group player.

4925
03:28:04,520 --> 03:28:05,680
I'm gonna try Jeff.

4926
03:28:09,140 --> 03:28:12,120
Are you gonna do flank Jeff or like front line?

4927
03:28:14,100 --> 03:28:15,060
Probably front line.

4928
03:28:15,380 --> 03:28:15,680
Okay.

4929
03:28:16,160 --> 03:28:17,360
Because I can't really flank.

4930
03:28:17,560 --> 03:28:19,260
Yeah, I was thinking about that.

4931
03:28:19,540 --> 03:28:21,340
Because if we're gonna flank, we need a triple support.

4932
03:28:24,900 --> 03:28:25,940
I'm not gonna play this.

4933
03:28:26,020 --> 03:28:26,340
My bad.

4934
03:28:28,180 --> 03:28:28,860
Oh, thank God.

4935
03:28:31,100 --> 03:28:31,580
Thank...

4936
03:28:31,580 --> 03:28:32,480
Wait, is this Jesse?

4937
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:32,940
Wait.

4938
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:36,780
No, it's not Jesse.

4939
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:37,340
I don't...

4940
03:28:37,340 --> 03:28:38,460
I don't trust this Jeff.

4941
03:28:38,780 --> 03:28:41,020
The only Jeff I trust is Jesse.

4942
03:28:41,660 --> 03:28:43,660
He's the only good Jeff player that I know.

4943
03:28:45,120 --> 03:28:46,180
Thank fucking God.

4944
03:28:46,280 --> 03:28:47,340
I was like...

4945
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:48,960
I tried to be nice on...

4946
03:28:48,960 --> 03:28:49,960
I tried to be nice.

4947
03:28:50,400 --> 03:28:51,820
So like, you know...

4948
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:53,640
I don't wanna piss off OneTrix.

4949
03:28:54,260 --> 03:28:56,220
They hold my ELO hostage.

4950
03:28:58,840 --> 03:29:01,920
I don't want my ELO to be held hostage.

4951
03:29:10,380 --> 03:29:10,900
Alright.

4952
03:29:11,120 --> 03:29:11,700
Let's go!

4953
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:18,880
This might be a long stream because I feel very ranky today.

4954
03:29:22,650 --> 03:29:23,770
I hear someone to my right.

4955
03:29:25,070 --> 03:29:25,250
Hella?

4956
03:29:25,490 --> 03:29:26,250
Hella behind us?

4957
03:29:29,090 --> 03:29:30,050
Hella's still behind.

4958
03:29:30,710 --> 03:29:31,270
Aww.

4959
03:29:33,570 --> 03:29:36,650
I couldn't do anything.

4960
03:29:40,420 --> 03:29:42,340
Oh no, I'm getting PTSD.

4961
03:29:44,200 --> 03:29:46,660
I'm getting PTSD now.

4962
03:29:50,750 --> 03:29:52,750
Alright, it's Jeff time.

4963
03:30:00,540 --> 03:30:03,460
Oh no, not the flank PTSD.

4964
03:30:04,500 --> 03:30:07,560
I just think for Marvel Rivals...

4965
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:13,520
It's literally the only game I can stream for super long hours and I would not get tired.

4966
03:30:14,140 --> 03:30:15,800
That's how much I enjoy this game.

4967
03:30:16,080 --> 03:30:17,360
And also, I have a problem.

4968
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:21,500
Oh shit.

4969
03:30:24,440 --> 03:30:25,480
Jesus Christ.

4970
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:27,580
I was trying to have a fucking conversation.

4971
03:30:28,080 --> 03:30:28,560
Think it's one.

4972
03:30:31,660 --> 03:30:32,580
Yes.

4973
03:30:32,740 --> 03:30:33,320
Fuck me.

4974
03:30:33,540 --> 03:30:35,580
Oh my god.

4975
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:39,840
Everything is okay for now.

4976
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:44,540
Everything is okay for now.

4977
03:30:47,880 --> 03:30:52,900
I don't have ult yet.

4978
03:30:58,880 --> 03:31:00,120
I'm 94.

4979
03:31:02,700 --> 03:31:04,280
Oh, I'm 98.

4980
03:31:06,360 --> 03:31:08,120
Aww, that's so unlucky.

4981
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:12,880
That's so unlucky there.

4982
03:31:13,480 --> 03:31:14,780
I didn't get my ult in time.

4983
03:31:19,330 --> 03:31:20,110
That's fine.

4984
03:31:20,870 --> 03:31:22,030
It was just unlucky.

4985
03:31:22,670 --> 03:31:25,050
We have one tank, they have two, so they build ult faster.

4986
03:31:30,330 --> 03:31:31,930
Like, what can I do?

4987
03:31:33,990 --> 03:31:35,050
Yummy, yummy.

4988
03:31:35,470 --> 03:31:37,170
Sad yummy, yummy.

4989
03:31:38,150 --> 03:31:38,710
Aww.

4990
03:31:39,510 --> 03:31:41,150
I don't know where the hell is.

4991
03:31:47,410 --> 03:31:49,930
I should have been more aware of my surroundings there.

4992
03:31:59,270 --> 03:31:59,870
Alright.

4993
03:32:01,630 --> 03:32:03,130
Hell is behind us.

4994
03:32:05,570 --> 03:32:06,730
I'm staying on point.

4995
03:32:14,190 --> 03:32:15,370
Oh, I need triple support.

4996
03:32:15,570 --> 03:32:18,310
Definitely need triple support.

4997
03:32:19,170 --> 03:32:20,890
Aww, it's so rough.

4998
03:32:25,290 --> 03:32:26,170
Oh, I need heals.

4999
03:32:26,310 --> 03:32:26,610
Thank you.

5000
03:32:29,290 --> 03:32:30,210
The thing is coming.

5001
03:32:30,290 --> 03:32:31,030
He has ult soon.

5002
03:32:43,860 --> 03:32:44,860
The thing has ult.

5003
03:32:44,900 --> 03:32:45,640
He's looking for it.

5004
03:32:50,350 --> 03:32:51,070
Oh no.

5005
03:33:03,700 --> 03:33:04,480
The hell is on me?

5006
03:33:07,200 --> 03:33:08,080
Aww, please.

5007
03:33:08,300 --> 03:33:10,140
Somebody kill the hell out.

5008
03:33:12,860 --> 03:33:15,360
Why can't they have the thing?

5009
03:33:16,780 --> 03:33:20,300
And get away with it, but I have the thing.

5010
03:33:20,520 --> 03:33:23,180
And like, we're trying.

5011
03:33:24,080 --> 03:33:25,020
Oh shit.

5012
03:33:25,780 --> 03:33:27,140
Oh shit, not again.

5013
03:33:28,700 --> 03:33:30,020
Not again.

5014
03:33:31,420 --> 03:33:32,940
Not again.

5015
03:33:33,160 --> 03:33:36,220
Please, I don't want to get clobbered.

5016
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:42,940
Oh man.

5017
03:33:44,200 --> 03:33:45,900
I think we might need triple support.

5018
03:33:51,060 --> 03:33:51,700
Alright.

5019
03:33:53,620 --> 03:33:54,260
Alright.

5020
03:33:54,980 --> 03:33:56,260
Get in here, Jeff.

5021
03:33:56,300 --> 03:33:57,660
It's you and me.

5022
03:33:58,460 --> 03:33:59,180
Get in.

5023
03:33:59,180 --> 03:34:01,420
Aww, goodbye, Jeff.

5024
03:34:03,580 --> 03:34:04,220
Goodbye.

5025
03:34:13,080 --> 03:34:14,380
I don't think he had it.

5026
03:34:19,590 --> 03:34:20,730
Oh, you're right.

5027
03:34:20,990 --> 03:34:23,230
It's time to get the tired eyes ready.

5028
03:34:24,050 --> 03:34:26,950
I think we definitely need triple support.

5029
03:34:28,210 --> 03:34:29,330
Okay, thank god.

5030
03:34:29,410 --> 03:34:30,570
Okay, I was gonna say.

5031
03:34:30,770 --> 03:34:32,530
I don't know if I can...

5032
03:34:32,530 --> 03:34:35,550
I don't know if I can do this with one defensive ult.

5033
03:34:35,930 --> 03:34:40,410
I was like, I don't know, man.

5034
03:34:40,690 --> 03:34:42,890
One defensive ult is like...

5035
03:34:42,890 --> 03:34:44,990
It's a little too much for me.

5036
03:34:45,430 --> 03:34:48,590
It's a little...

5037
03:34:49,230 --> 03:34:50,810
It's a little a lot.

5038
03:34:51,230 --> 03:34:53,270
Just, you know, it's a lot.

5039
03:34:55,110 --> 03:34:59,270
And then, you know, the Hella was just going pew pew.

5040
03:34:59,410 --> 03:35:00,490
And I was like, Hella bye.

5041
03:35:07,250 --> 03:35:09,790
Am I the only support player in this game?

5042
03:35:09,850 --> 03:35:10,950
Other than the shark player?

5043
03:35:14,790 --> 03:35:15,310
Oh.

5044
03:35:16,210 --> 03:35:18,410
Wait, why is he stopping?

5045
03:35:19,590 --> 03:35:20,790
Why are you not walking?

5046
03:35:28,100 --> 03:35:29,100
Where are we going?

5047
03:35:35,220 --> 03:35:36,640
Oh, no one put this on.

5048
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:39,580
Frozen?

5049
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:47,220
Try not to.

5050
03:35:49,200 --> 03:35:50,600
Can I...

5051
03:35:57,410 --> 03:35:58,020
Oh, god.

5052
03:35:59,220 --> 03:36:00,680
Goodbye, Bucky.

5053
03:36:01,280 --> 03:36:02,140
You poor man.

5054
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:04,420
You poor man.

5055
03:36:07,220 --> 03:36:08,660
You poor man.

5056
03:36:10,340 --> 03:36:11,840
Oh, my god.

5057
03:36:12,580 --> 03:36:14,220
Oh, it's... Of course, it's moving.

5058
03:36:16,460 --> 03:36:18,500
Oh, you poor man.

5059
03:36:19,360 --> 03:36:20,420
Oh, we can't see you.

5060
03:36:23,260 --> 03:36:24,000
Alright.

5061
03:36:32,080 --> 03:36:32,900
Oh, fuck.

5062
03:36:32,980 --> 03:36:33,200
Okay.

5063
03:36:34,020 --> 03:36:35,350
I'm trying my best to...

5064
03:36:36,120 --> 03:36:38,900
Make sure everybody is getting the heals they need.

5065
03:36:42,440 --> 03:36:47,860
It hits me behind the watch, bullshit.

5066
03:36:48,100 --> 03:36:50,780
I was around the fucking corner.

5067
03:36:51,620 --> 03:36:53,180
Oh, my god.

5068
03:36:53,280 --> 03:36:54,240
What the fuck?

5069
03:36:54,340 --> 03:36:54,940
Where am I?

5070
03:36:55,340 --> 03:36:56,780
Where am I?

5071
03:36:57,380 --> 03:36:58,480
I kill first.

5072
03:37:05,680 --> 03:37:07,640
How is that possible?

5073
03:37:08,820 --> 03:37:12,040
Three, two, one.

5074
03:37:24,630 --> 03:37:26,810
Oh, my god.

5075
03:37:28,230 --> 03:37:29,390
That...

5076
03:37:29,390 --> 03:37:31,010
Okay.

5077
03:37:33,510 --> 03:37:34,970
At least I froze him.

5078
03:37:45,130 --> 03:37:45,970
Okay.

5079
03:37:47,630 --> 03:37:48,470
Goodbye.

5080
03:37:52,510 --> 03:37:53,350
Goodbye.

5081
03:37:57,500 --> 03:37:58,340
Okay.

5082
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:05,940
Someone's child is fucking saying stuff.

5083
03:38:06,900 --> 03:38:07,460
Thing is low.

5084
03:38:08,780 --> 03:38:09,600
Oh, my god.

5085
03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:10,100
We did it.

5086
03:38:10,140 --> 03:38:10,700
We capped.

5087
03:38:12,160 --> 03:38:13,700
Okay, that fucking...

5088
03:38:14,720 --> 03:38:18,260
That fucking... All behind was fucked up.

5089
03:38:18,340 --> 03:38:19,940
That was actually...

5090
03:38:19,940 --> 03:38:22,260
That was actually so fucked up.

5091
03:38:22,420 --> 03:38:24,200
Bro, this guy... Take care of your child, please.

5092
03:38:24,580 --> 03:38:26,280
Take care of your child.

5093
03:38:27,520 --> 03:38:28,580
Oh, no.

5094
03:38:28,900 --> 03:38:29,840
Oh, no.

5095
03:38:30,780 --> 03:38:33,900
I am not optimistic right now.

5096
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:37,620
We don't see you for heals.

5097
03:38:44,280 --> 03:38:44,680
Nice.

5098
03:38:44,680 --> 03:38:45,280
He has will-o.

5099
03:38:56,160 --> 03:38:57,660
I'm... There's a hell up top.

5100
03:38:57,720 --> 03:38:58,060
High ground.

5101
03:38:58,200 --> 03:38:58,700
I can't peek.

5102
03:39:11,950 --> 03:39:13,150
There's still a hell of high ground.

5103
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:17,740
I'm not... I'm not peeking anymore.

5104
03:39:25,460 --> 03:39:25,860
Nice.

5105
03:39:26,420 --> 03:39:26,820
Okay.

5106
03:39:32,010 --> 03:39:32,990
I'll try to ult first.

5107
03:39:50,880 --> 03:39:52,040
Okay.

5108
03:39:52,040 --> 03:39:53,040
You're walking for it?

5109
03:39:55,900 --> 03:39:57,020
No shit.

5110
03:40:03,080 --> 03:40:04,200
I'm ulting this.

5111
03:40:09,780 --> 03:40:11,080
I'm damage boosting you.

5112
03:40:14,580 --> 03:40:15,740
One.

5113
03:40:16,960 --> 03:40:17,720
Three can clone me.

5114
03:40:17,720 --> 03:40:19,720
Come on.

5115
03:40:29,950 --> 03:40:30,830
I have no passive.

5116
03:40:32,130 --> 03:40:32,530
Nice.

5117
03:40:33,070 --> 03:40:33,590
Nice shot.

5118
03:40:36,450 --> 03:40:38,690
Oh, they all got off.

5119
03:40:39,130 --> 03:40:40,670
They all got off the point.

5120
03:40:41,030 --> 03:40:41,890
Thank God.

5121
03:40:45,990 --> 03:40:48,730
Thank God there is a guide.

5122
03:40:49,830 --> 03:40:51,570
There is a fucking guide.

5123
03:40:53,730 --> 03:40:55,190
I believe now.

5124
03:40:59,850 --> 03:41:00,470
Oh.

5125
03:41:00,570 --> 03:41:01,250
Oh, thank God.

5126
03:41:03,670 --> 03:41:06,570
And the only skin I like for supports is President Loki.

5127
03:41:06,750 --> 03:41:08,490
Every other skin fucking sucks.

5128
03:41:09,770 --> 03:41:11,730
I don't... You can't change my mind.

5129
03:41:12,030 --> 03:41:15,430
I think every other skin, the supports are not that great.

5130
03:41:16,710 --> 03:41:18,910
That's what I'm saying.

5131
03:41:19,850 --> 03:41:22,750
They've been playing magic since season... since beta.

5132
03:41:24,410 --> 03:41:27,890
So, like, this person better be a really fucking good magic player.

5133
03:41:28,110 --> 03:41:28,650
And they are.

5134
03:41:32,990 --> 03:41:36,090
Having the wrong opinion is fine.

5135
03:41:40,590 --> 03:41:41,530
I like it.

5136
03:41:41,530 --> 03:41:42,830
I like it, personally.

5137
03:41:43,110 --> 03:41:43,790
Not a huge fan.

5138
03:41:58,240 --> 03:42:01,280
Guys, you didn't see me whiff like three fucking shots on them.

5139
03:42:01,420 --> 03:42:02,380
You didn't see that, guys.

5140
03:42:03,360 --> 03:42:03,720
Hahaha.

5141
03:42:05,680 --> 03:42:06,880
Oh, no.

5142
03:42:11,570 --> 03:42:12,830
I guess we leave.

5143
03:42:13,530 --> 03:42:14,230
Hahaha.

5144
03:42:17,630 --> 03:42:18,330
Reload.

5145
03:42:19,510 --> 03:42:19,970
That's fine.

5146
03:42:20,490 --> 03:42:21,430
I didn't miss these, though.

5147
03:42:22,150 --> 03:42:23,710
I didn't miss these, though.

5148
03:42:29,340 --> 03:42:30,060
What?

5149
03:42:31,700 --> 03:42:33,060
Oh, my God.

5150
03:42:33,220 --> 03:42:33,540
Okay.

5151
03:42:35,260 --> 03:42:36,020
There's a...

5152
03:42:36,980 --> 03:42:37,980
There's a heli to our left.

5153
03:42:44,700 --> 03:42:45,580
I got it.

5154
03:42:47,860 --> 03:42:48,800
Pushing up.

5155
03:42:57,480 --> 03:42:57,800
Oh.

5156
03:42:59,000 --> 03:42:59,960
That's fine.

5157
03:43:02,020 --> 03:43:03,720
Oh, please, copy!

5158
03:43:03,940 --> 03:43:05,040
Oh, thank God!

5159
03:43:05,120 --> 03:43:06,340
I feel so safe!

5160
03:43:14,300 --> 03:43:14,940
Mag half.

5161
03:43:19,140 --> 03:43:20,480
Oh, that sucks.

5162
03:43:21,440 --> 03:43:22,580
That actually sucks.

5163
03:43:29,610 --> 03:43:31,370
Oh, that really sucks.

5164
03:43:33,010 --> 03:43:34,110
I have to reload.

5165
03:43:39,300 --> 03:43:40,360
Oh, that's fine.

5166
03:43:43,580 --> 03:43:46,540
Our Punisher was just not having a good day, guys.

5167
03:43:46,960 --> 03:43:47,600
Our...

5168
03:43:47,600 --> 03:43:48,240
Hahaha.

5169
03:43:52,460 --> 03:43:54,960
You know, our Punisher...

5170
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:56,640
He's at a...

5171
03:43:57,420 --> 03:44:03,420
He may or may not be on a negative KDA at the moment.

5172
03:44:03,580 --> 03:44:04,800
And that is fine!

5173
03:44:05,740 --> 03:44:07,160
That is okay!

5174
03:44:08,100 --> 03:44:10,720
Mr. Splashgun is not having it.

5175
03:44:10,860 --> 03:44:12,100
That's okay.

5176
03:44:15,320 --> 03:44:16,500
That's okay!

5177
03:44:23,860 --> 03:44:25,660
Okay, two, one.

5178
03:44:32,060 --> 03:44:34,920
Oh, this is a little scary, though.

5179
03:44:41,990 --> 03:44:43,030
He's frozen.

5180
03:44:53,140 --> 03:44:55,940
The one time I peeked!

5181
03:44:57,040 --> 03:44:57,840
I was looking at self-heal.

5182
03:44:57,960 --> 03:44:58,300
Shift.

5183
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:00,020
It's okay, guys.

5184
03:45:00,600 --> 03:45:01,380
The game is very good.

5185
03:45:02,380 --> 03:45:05,040
I now have my first avoid of the day.

5186
03:45:05,660 --> 03:45:06,100
Hahaha.

5187
03:45:08,040 --> 03:45:11,080
I don't think Splashgun...

5188
03:45:12,620 --> 03:45:15,160
was doing it for today.

5189
03:45:15,440 --> 03:45:15,760
I...

5190
03:45:15,760 --> 03:45:16,460
Hahaha.

5191
03:45:20,120 --> 03:45:26,640
I don't think Splashgun really knew what he was doing.

5192
03:45:28,640 --> 03:45:29,580
Okay, wait.

5193
03:45:30,220 --> 03:45:30,860
Actually...

5194
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:31,880
I mean...

5195
03:45:33,700 --> 03:45:36,880
I need to feel something so I play ranked, guys.

5196
03:45:37,080 --> 03:45:37,760
I just...

5197
03:45:37,760 --> 03:45:40,140
I need to feel something.

5198
03:45:40,140 --> 03:45:41,020
Hahaha.

5199
03:45:42,580 --> 03:45:44,120
Alright, don't worry.

5200
03:45:44,740 --> 03:45:46,020
I got you, guys.

5201
03:45:46,320 --> 03:45:47,320
This is how I...

5202
03:45:47,320 --> 03:45:50,120
It's time for how I truly feel today.

5203
03:45:54,320 --> 03:45:55,200
It's time.

5204
03:45:57,040 --> 03:45:58,160
There we go.

5205
03:45:59,880 --> 03:46:02,260
It's time for how I truly feel.

5206
03:46:02,980 --> 03:46:03,940
I don't know, I think I was doing alright.

5207
03:46:06,620 --> 03:46:07,680
I was doing alright.

5208
03:46:07,740 --> 03:46:09,340
I mean, like, what can I do?

5209
03:46:09,340 --> 03:46:10,160
I'm fucking Luna.

5210
03:46:10,360 --> 03:46:10,740
Hahaha.

5211
03:46:15,720 --> 03:46:18,360
This is the only way I feel joy.

5212
03:46:24,380 --> 03:46:27,060
Playing ranked is what will give me happiness.

5213
03:46:27,900 --> 03:46:28,240
Hahaha.

5214
03:46:30,980 --> 03:46:33,000
I mean, the games are good, though.

5215
03:46:33,100 --> 03:46:34,180
I have to admit.

5216
03:46:34,500 --> 03:46:35,040
I...

5217
03:46:37,060 --> 03:46:37,600
Uh...

5218
03:46:38,660 --> 03:46:39,180
Uh...

5219
03:46:39,180 --> 03:46:41,460
The games are, like...

5220
03:46:41,460 --> 03:46:42,700
Are good.

5221
03:46:42,840 --> 03:46:44,140
I'm enjoying the games.

5222
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:46,000
Because it's, like, higher elo.

5223
03:46:46,260 --> 03:46:47,480
So, like, I can...

5224
03:46:47,480 --> 03:46:48,560
It's just, you know...

5225
03:46:48,560 --> 03:46:49,520
It feels much...

5226
03:46:49,520 --> 03:46:50,220
Definitely feels...

5227
03:46:50,220 --> 03:46:52,940
It's, like, much more coordinated than what I'm more used to.

5228
03:46:54,960 --> 03:46:55,480
Yeah.

5229
03:46:55,820 --> 03:46:57,840
So, like, it's more high...

5230
03:46:57,840 --> 03:46:58,580
It's, like...

5231
03:46:58,580 --> 03:46:59,940
Obviously, it's, like...

5232
03:46:59,940 --> 03:47:01,980
People are, like, higher skilled.

5233
03:47:02,160 --> 03:47:03,060
So, like...

5234
03:47:03,980 --> 03:47:04,500
Uh...

5235
03:47:04,500 --> 03:47:05,680
I feel, like...

5236
03:47:05,680 --> 03:47:07,040
I do enjoy...

5237
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:07,820
Like...

5238
03:47:07,820 --> 03:47:09,240
Even if I lose...

5239
03:47:09,240 --> 03:47:11,960
I enjoy the quality of the games more.

5240
03:47:14,840 --> 03:47:15,280
Uh...

5241
03:47:15,280 --> 03:47:16,040
A little bit more...

5242
03:47:17,480 --> 03:47:17,920
Uh...

5243
03:47:17,920 --> 03:47:19,160
A little bit more laid back.

5244
03:47:20,120 --> 03:47:20,560
Well...

5245
03:47:21,460 --> 03:47:24,320
I don't care right now about, like...

5246
03:47:24,320 --> 03:47:25,740
I just want good quality.

5247
03:47:25,980 --> 03:47:30,120
Like, I want to have, like, a good quality game where it feels close.

5248
03:47:30,680 --> 03:47:31,120
Because...

5249
03:47:31,680 --> 03:47:32,120
Um...

5250
03:47:32,120 --> 03:47:32,800
Like, it's...

5251
03:47:32,800 --> 03:47:34,620
I just want, like, close games type deal.

5252
03:47:34,860 --> 03:47:36,100
Oh, I have the magic player again.

5253
03:47:37,820 --> 03:47:39,940
I think I'm just gonna queue into the same...

5254
03:47:39,940 --> 03:47:40,680
Oh, no.

5255
03:47:40,900 --> 03:47:41,160
Please!

5256
03:47:43,060 --> 03:47:43,380
No!

5257
03:47:44,160 --> 03:47:45,080
How do I

5258
03:47:49,710 --> 03:47:50,730
have...

5259
03:47:50,730 --> 03:47:51,670
That's crazy.

5260
03:47:52,130 --> 03:47:54,030
Maybe today is just very unlucky.

5261
03:47:54,430 --> 03:47:57,210
Maybe it's just a very unlucky day today.

5262
03:48:00,970 --> 03:48:02,570
No, I have two...

5263
03:48:02,570 --> 03:48:03,450
Wait, it's...

5264
03:48:03,450 --> 03:48:03,950
Oh, my God.

5265
03:48:03,990 --> 03:48:04,950
We don't know what we want to ban.

5266
03:48:05,110 --> 03:48:07,210
We don't know what we want to fucking ban.

5267
03:48:07,970 --> 03:48:10,270
Look at these 25, 25, 20...

5268
03:48:10,270 --> 03:48:11,770
Alright, let's go gambling.

5269
03:48:12,010 --> 03:48:12,830
Okay, they ban Neymar.

5270
03:48:13,010 --> 03:48:13,890
Thank fucking God.

5271
03:48:16,830 --> 03:48:20,770
Okay, it can't all be doom queuing, guys.

5272
03:48:21,690 --> 03:48:22,650
It's not...

5273
03:48:22,650 --> 03:48:24,570
It can't all just be doom queue.

5274
03:48:24,930 --> 03:48:28,150
Some of these games are just what it is.

5275
03:48:30,890 --> 03:48:32,790
Fuck yeah, let's just ban Starlord.

5276
03:48:32,870 --> 03:48:33,430
I don't mind.

5277
03:48:37,640 --> 03:48:38,220
I...

5278
03:48:38,220 --> 03:48:41,160
I don't know how I feel about my team.

5279
03:48:45,740 --> 03:48:46,300
I...

5280
03:48:52,360 --> 03:48:52,920
Okay.

5281
03:48:54,860 --> 03:48:56,560
Jeff, Chucky, Le...

5282
03:48:56,560 --> 03:48:58,040
I have no idea who these people are.

5283
03:48:58,380 --> 03:48:59,740
To be fair, I play at night usually.

5284
03:48:59,920 --> 03:49:02,540
So, I don't know the morning hour people.

5285
03:49:04,240 --> 03:49:06,880
I don't know the morning hour...

5286
03:49:06,880 --> 03:49:09,640
The morning hour players.

5287
03:49:12,500 --> 03:49:14,040
Or the afternoon players.

5288
03:49:15,900 --> 03:49:17,750
Never seen them before in my life.

5289
03:49:25,880 --> 03:49:26,500
Okay.

5290
03:49:27,040 --> 03:49:27,660
Woah.

5291
03:49:27,940 --> 03:49:28,560
Alright.

5292
03:49:29,540 --> 03:49:31,780
This is looking optimistic.

5293
03:49:32,100 --> 03:49:33,200
Is this Karth again?

5294
03:49:33,620 --> 03:49:33,920
No.

5295
03:49:34,200 --> 03:49:34,900
Yeah, it is.

5296
03:49:35,020 --> 03:49:35,700
It's domination.

5297
03:49:38,920 --> 03:49:39,540
Um...

5298
03:49:39,540 --> 03:49:40,940
This is fine.

5299
03:49:42,780 --> 03:49:44,800
I'll put it on the strange.

5300
03:49:44,900 --> 03:49:45,520
This is fine.

5301
03:49:46,780 --> 03:49:48,160
The day shift people.

5302
03:49:48,800 --> 03:49:51,100
I always thought I missed the Korean players.

5303
03:49:53,480 --> 03:49:56,800
The Korean players would bring me more joy.

5304
03:50:01,220 --> 03:50:02,780
I miss them.

5305
03:50:05,580 --> 03:50:06,320
I'm in streamer mode.

5306
03:50:06,360 --> 03:50:09,200
I have streamer mode on because I don't like people knowing.

5307
03:50:10,940 --> 03:50:12,600
It's actually been really helpful.

5308
03:50:23,310 --> 03:50:24,470
Oh my god.

5309
03:50:24,650 --> 03:50:26,110
What the fuck is going on?

5310
03:50:30,090 --> 03:50:31,110
Where's our...

5311
03:50:33,270 --> 03:50:34,670
We have one tank?

5312
03:50:35,050 --> 03:50:36,030
Where's our other tank?

5313
03:50:55,090 --> 03:50:56,190
Oh, we do have one tank.

5314
03:50:56,210 --> 03:50:56,950
I didn't even realize.

5315
03:50:57,810 --> 03:50:58,990
Oh my god.

5316
03:51:00,750 --> 03:51:01,870
I didn't even realize.

5317
03:51:11,010 --> 03:51:11,790
I'll ult first.

5318
03:51:11,870 --> 03:51:12,270
I'll ult first.

5319
03:51:17,930 --> 03:51:18,870
Push up with this?

5320
03:51:21,430 --> 03:51:22,250
It's back here.

5321
03:51:22,350 --> 03:51:22,830
It's back here.

5322
03:51:29,430 --> 03:51:30,010
Adam's low.

5323
03:51:30,090 --> 03:51:30,490
Adam's low.

5324
03:51:30,630 --> 03:51:31,010
Adam half.

5325
03:51:37,110 --> 03:51:37,570
Woah.

5326
03:51:41,650 --> 03:51:42,350
Invis low.

5327
03:51:43,170 --> 03:51:43,990
Or close, sorry.

5328
03:51:50,420 --> 03:51:51,540
You only have one heal.

5329
03:51:57,970 --> 03:51:58,910
Trying to heal you.

5330
03:52:03,590 --> 03:52:05,750
Oh, I'm trying my best.

5331
03:52:18,590 --> 03:52:19,330
We're trying.

5332
03:52:22,890 --> 03:52:24,090
There's an Adam behind you guys.

5333
03:52:24,130 --> 03:52:24,510
Adam behind.

5334
03:52:24,650 --> 03:52:25,090
Oh, nice.

5335
03:52:25,750 --> 03:52:26,050
He's dead.

5336
03:52:26,490 --> 03:52:27,230
He's dead.

5337
03:52:28,810 --> 03:52:30,850
What the fuck is going on?

5338
03:52:31,330 --> 03:52:33,110
Oh my god.

5339
03:52:33,170 --> 03:52:35,130
I'm so stressed out.

5340
03:52:39,110 --> 03:52:40,110
Oh my god.

5341
03:52:40,130 --> 03:52:41,210
I'm so stressed out.

5342
03:52:41,290 --> 03:52:42,470
I'm so stressed out.

5343
03:52:43,810 --> 03:52:46,610
I'm so stressed out right now.

5344
03:52:46,750 --> 03:52:48,070
What the fuck is going...

5345
03:52:48,710 --> 03:52:49,550
I didn't reload.

5346
03:52:53,910 --> 03:52:55,150
Okay, okay.

5347
03:53:01,490 --> 03:53:02,570
Door to the left.

5348
03:53:02,690 --> 03:53:03,070
Door on me.

5349
03:53:04,910 --> 03:53:05,530
Three,

5350
03:53:14,690 --> 03:53:15,970
two, one.

5351
03:53:16,050 --> 03:53:16,590
Backing out.

5352
03:53:19,630 --> 03:53:20,550
I'm on...

5353
03:53:20,550 --> 03:53:21,550
I got push off point.

5354
03:53:28,380 --> 03:53:29,360
We're ulted.

5355
03:53:32,180 --> 03:53:32,840
We'll just wait.

5356
03:53:33,160 --> 03:53:33,800
It'll be fine.

5357
03:53:39,710 --> 03:53:41,130
What the fuck?

5358
03:53:42,590 --> 03:53:42,790
Yeah.

5359
03:53:54,400 --> 03:53:57,260
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on?

5360
03:53:57,560 --> 03:53:58,800
What is going on?

5361
03:53:58,900 --> 03:54:02,200
What is going on right now?

5362
03:54:09,660 --> 03:54:11,200
Oh my god, thank god.

5363
03:54:11,680 --> 03:54:12,580
We have rez here.

5364
03:54:13,060 --> 03:54:14,100
Rez, rez, rez up here.

5365
03:54:14,360 --> 03:54:15,160
Adam is right here.

5366
03:54:15,680 --> 03:54:16,200
Top, top, top.

5367
03:54:20,600 --> 03:54:21,040
Alright.

5368
03:54:24,160 --> 03:54:26,000
Did he use those rez though?

5369
03:54:26,880 --> 03:54:28,020
He didn't, yeah.

5370
03:54:30,920 --> 03:54:31,360
Portal.

5371
03:54:47,080 --> 03:54:47,740
I have ult.

5372
03:54:47,800 --> 03:54:48,480
I'm gonna ult this.

5373
03:54:48,700 --> 03:54:49,920
Actually, we don't need it yet.

5374
03:54:50,620 --> 03:54:51,280
Ulting now.

5375
03:55:00,740 --> 03:55:03,640
Four, three, two, one.

5376
03:55:06,000 --> 03:55:07,060
I froze somebody.

5377
03:55:07,720 --> 03:55:08,440
Door one, door one.

5378
03:55:08,580 --> 03:55:09,140
Door one, door one.

5379
03:55:23,020 --> 03:55:24,640
Oh no, this is the last fight.

5380
03:55:27,080 --> 03:55:28,320
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch, touch.

5381
03:55:28,600 --> 03:55:29,060
No.

5382
03:55:31,640 --> 03:55:33,260
I need second tank, I can't.

5383
03:55:35,080 --> 03:55:36,700
Don't worry, it's just constant pushing.

5384
03:55:37,260 --> 03:55:40,620
I don't know, I think one of our supports should go fucking Bucky.

5385
03:55:40,720 --> 03:55:42,260
I can play second tank, but...

5386
03:55:42,940 --> 03:55:43,380
I don't know, bro.

5387
03:55:43,500 --> 03:55:46,060
We're forcing Rocket and Bucky is undamaged.

5388
03:55:46,740 --> 03:55:48,300
Like, someone needs to play Bucky, bro.

5389
03:55:50,540 --> 03:55:53,380
Like, you just held S from point for some reason and let them cap for free.

5390
03:55:55,500 --> 03:55:56,460
Can you tank, Ratkin?

5391
03:55:56,800 --> 03:55:57,120
Or no?

5392
03:56:01,520 --> 03:56:02,320
Oh no.

5393
03:56:05,220 --> 03:56:06,020
Why can't...

5394
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:08,460
Why can't they Bucky?

5395
03:56:09,320 --> 03:56:11,080
Why can't they walk forward?

5396
03:56:11,580 --> 03:56:12,980
This is a curse.

5397
03:56:14,460 --> 03:56:16,300
None of them walk forward.

5398
03:56:26,300 --> 03:56:29,540
It's not a problem, I'm just gonna constantly push by tower and then you have no front line.

5399
03:56:32,800 --> 03:56:36,220
We didn't... I don't understand why we don't walk forward.

5400
03:56:40,080 --> 03:56:41,500
At least it's not me.

5401
03:56:42,420 --> 03:56:44,080
I think I'm doing pretty alright.

5402
03:56:45,980 --> 03:56:47,200
What the fuck?

5403
03:56:53,340 --> 03:56:55,300
It's not me at least, you know?

5404
03:56:57,460 --> 03:56:59,420
At one point it's me though.

5405
03:56:59,660 --> 03:57:00,400
At one point.

5406
03:57:00,900 --> 03:57:02,680
I might have to dodge this Q though.

5407
03:57:15,650 --> 03:57:16,570
Try it.

5408
03:57:18,090 --> 03:57:19,290
Oh my god.

5409
03:57:27,030 --> 03:57:28,110
Jesus Christ.

5410
03:57:33,520 --> 03:57:35,140
At one point it's me.

5411
03:57:44,540 --> 03:57:46,760
I think he's a one trick, isn't he?

5412
03:57:48,180 --> 03:57:49,040
I don't know.

5413
03:57:49,600 --> 03:57:50,800
We just gotta play around the one trick.

5414
03:57:59,510 --> 03:58:00,170
Let it go.

5415
03:58:00,170 --> 03:58:01,910
Add him to the right, add him by himself.

5416
03:58:08,720 --> 03:58:10,640
Oh my god, I got you.

5417
03:58:12,460 --> 03:58:13,560
Oh, I'm walking forward.

5418
03:58:18,670 --> 03:58:20,550
Nice, there's a...

5419
03:58:31,250 --> 03:58:32,450
I don't think I live.

5420
03:58:34,370 --> 03:58:35,450
Oh shit, hello.

5421
03:58:38,850 --> 03:58:40,230
I was like, hello.

5422
03:58:41,370 --> 03:58:43,250
There's a Thor on supports.

5423
03:58:51,630 --> 03:58:53,610
Guys, at one point is it me?

5424
03:58:54,290 --> 03:58:55,830
Guys, at one point.

5425
03:58:56,350 --> 03:58:58,110
Should I say maybe it's me?

5426
03:59:01,470 --> 03:59:05,710
Guys, at one point is it me, guys?

5427
03:59:05,870 --> 03:59:06,970
I can't tell.

5428
03:59:11,150 --> 03:59:13,090
Or is it because of Raccoon?

5429
03:59:14,610 --> 03:59:16,250
Is it because of Raccoon?

5430
03:59:17,230 --> 03:59:18,870
Or is it because of me?

5431
03:59:19,010 --> 03:59:20,330
At what point is it?

5432
03:59:20,370 --> 03:59:21,790
I can't tell anymore.

5433
03:59:22,010 --> 03:59:23,470
I can't.

5434
03:59:25,430 --> 03:59:26,790
I am...

5435
03:59:26,790 --> 03:59:28,190
There's a Thor on me.

5436
03:59:28,670 --> 03:59:37,140
I don't have a...

5437
03:59:45,130 --> 03:59:46,250
I'm 97.

5438
03:59:46,250 --> 03:59:46,370
97.

5439
03:59:49,230 --> 03:59:51,350
At what point is it me?

5440
03:59:53,970 --> 03:59:56,150
No, no, this is my shield.

5441
03:59:56,430 --> 03:59:56,790
Okay.

5442
03:59:57,770 --> 03:59:59,210
I can't tell.

5443
04:00:00,530 --> 04:00:00,930
Goodbye.

5444
04:00:06,170 --> 04:00:06,950
It's not?

5445
04:00:07,090 --> 04:00:07,810
Okay, good.

5446
04:00:07,890 --> 04:00:09,050
Alright, it's not my fault.

5447
04:00:09,370 --> 04:00:10,170
That's good.

5448
04:00:10,810 --> 04:00:12,450
Don't worry, chat will let me know.

5449
04:00:12,550 --> 04:00:13,270
Thank you guys.

5450
04:00:13,270 --> 04:00:13,990
I'm glad.

5451
04:00:14,170 --> 04:00:16,430
I'm glad chat is there for me.

5452
04:00:18,610 --> 04:00:19,910
It's not me.

5453
04:00:20,230 --> 04:00:21,510
That's good to know.

5454
04:00:21,630 --> 04:00:22,510
It's not me.

5455
04:00:23,090 --> 04:00:24,630
Oh, thank god.

5456
04:00:25,030 --> 04:00:26,410
It's not me.

5457
04:00:27,830 --> 04:00:29,730
Thank fucking god.

5458
04:00:30,270 --> 04:00:32,010
I was curious, you know?

5459
04:00:32,090 --> 04:00:33,970
I'm like, at what point if it is me?

5460
04:00:39,010 --> 04:00:41,570
Yay, it's not me.

5461
04:00:43,270 --> 04:00:44,570
Thank god.

5462
04:00:51,830 --> 04:00:54,450
It's not me.

5463
04:00:58,860 --> 04:00:59,790
Let's go.

5464
04:01:00,410 --> 04:01:03,410
I shall break the streak someday.

5465
04:01:05,970 --> 04:01:10,210
How does a rocket have ATK healing?

5466
04:01:10,210 --> 04:01:13,330
That's actually very impressive for a rocket.

5467
04:01:13,530 --> 04:01:14,710
That is incredible.

5468
04:01:14,830 --> 04:01:15,110
You know what?

5469
04:01:15,190 --> 04:01:15,750
I have the most heals.

5470
04:01:15,970 --> 04:01:17,070
I'll take this.

5471
04:01:22,990 --> 04:01:24,510
At last, it was.

5472
04:01:24,590 --> 04:01:26,130
I'm gonna fucking walk my dog.

5473
04:01:29,490 --> 04:01:30,010
Walking.

5474
04:01:36,450 --> 04:01:39,050
Get ready for a long day.

5475
04:01:41,350 --> 04:01:43,370
It's not me.

5476
04:01:44,670 --> 04:01:45,790
Thank god.

5477
04:01:45,950 --> 04:01:47,530
Okay, I'll be right back.

5478
04:10:33,160 --> 04:10:34,700
I am back.

5479
04:10:35,280 --> 04:10:36,600
I am back, guys.

5480
04:10:37,120 --> 04:10:40,140
You know, at least Jokey is having a good day.

5481
04:10:40,720 --> 04:10:43,300
Because like, while I was taking him on a walk...

5482
04:10:43,300 --> 04:10:44,380
We bumped into a...

5483
04:10:44,380 --> 04:10:46,320
We were waiting at the crossroads.

5484
04:10:46,500 --> 04:10:48,940
And like, there was a bunch of nurses.

5485
04:10:49,300 --> 04:10:50,600
A pretty lady nurses.

5486
04:10:51,120 --> 04:10:52,820
While we were waiting for the...

5487
04:10:52,820 --> 04:10:54,680
While we were waiting for the...

5488
04:10:54,680 --> 04:10:55,960
The crossroads.

5489
04:10:56,480 --> 04:10:58,560
And then, you know, they all loved him.

5490
04:10:58,700 --> 04:11:01,240
And then they're like, aw, you're so cute.

5491
04:11:01,320 --> 04:11:02,160
And you're like, what guy?

5492
04:11:02,400 --> 04:11:04,040
And then obviously he was getting...

5493
04:11:04,040 --> 04:11:06,880
He was getting surrounded by all these beautiful nurses.

5494
04:11:07,480 --> 04:11:08,300
And then he's...

5495
04:11:08,300 --> 04:11:09,700
They're all like petting him.

5496
04:11:09,780 --> 04:11:10,980
And it was like, Jokey.

5497
04:11:11,420 --> 04:11:12,700
Aw, Jokey, Jokey.

5498
04:11:13,600 --> 04:11:16,580
And then, at least somebody's having a good day.

5499
04:11:18,660 --> 04:11:23,880
At least one Jokey is having a great day.

5500
04:11:24,120 --> 04:11:26,940
You know, that's all that matters.

5501
04:11:28,720 --> 04:11:35,360
At least one of us is going through a good day.

5502
04:11:36,800 --> 04:11:38,080
Oh my god.

5503
04:11:38,480 --> 04:11:39,880
Okay, let me just...

5504
04:11:39,880 --> 04:11:41,740
Let me just tell...

5505
04:11:41,740 --> 04:11:43,400
Okay, let me call real quick.

5506
04:11:44,020 --> 04:11:45,220
Let me call real quick.

5507
04:11:45,220 --> 04:11:47,880
Hello, I am 10-0 right now.

5508
04:11:48,020 --> 04:11:52,740
And like, it's not looking good for me.

5509
04:11:57,260 --> 04:11:57,900
So...

5510
04:11:58,720 --> 04:12:05,340
At one point, if we lose this next one, then I will find out that I might be the problem.

5511
04:12:08,280 --> 04:12:14,300
And I hope by you playing with me, I don't curse your team.

5512
04:12:14,300 --> 04:12:15,360
Oh sorry, I'm 0-10.

5513
04:12:15,540 --> 04:12:19,140
Sorry, I forgot when you're losing, your side is the 0.

5514
04:12:19,600 --> 04:12:21,000
Sorry, I'm 0-10.

5515
04:12:21,120 --> 04:12:26,960
By the way, I hope that I do not give you all my bad luck and then Sentinels is gonna lose.

5516
04:12:27,060 --> 04:12:28,420
I hope that's not the case.

5517
04:12:28,700 --> 04:12:30,240
No, no, it's not gonna happen.

5518
04:12:30,240 --> 04:12:35,400
But if Sentinels does lose to 100 Thieves today, you can blame me.

5519
04:12:36,220 --> 04:12:38,780
I've cursed your team.

5520
04:12:39,180 --> 04:12:42,140
Alright, I'm gonna get a call now and talk to my chat now.

5521
04:12:42,980 --> 04:12:44,680
Good luck out there.

5522
04:12:44,680 --> 04:12:47,060
I'll try to do some good comms.

5523
04:12:47,060 --> 04:12:48,860
Good luck out there.

5524
04:12:49,620 --> 04:12:59,520
All I'm saying is if somehow Sentinels lose, it's because I touched the...

5525
04:12:59,520 --> 04:13:00,660
Okay, that sounded very bad.

5526
04:13:08,060 --> 04:13:11,960
It's because my bad luck has spread.

5527
04:13:12,120 --> 04:13:13,760
It's like a fucking virus.

5528
04:13:14,320 --> 04:13:15,480
It's like a pandemic.

5529
04:13:16,120 --> 04:13:19,920
Guys, I know I hate to say this.

5530
04:13:20,000 --> 04:13:21,300
I know it's fucking crazy.

5531
04:13:21,820 --> 04:13:24,900
But not every day you can win, guys.

5532
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:27,360
I can't win every day, guys.

5533
04:13:27,360 --> 04:13:32,620
Today is one of those days where sadly, I know it's fucking crazy.

5534
04:13:32,740 --> 04:13:36,380
But like, you just can't win.

5535
04:13:41,760 --> 04:13:45,340
Not every day you can win in life.

5536
04:13:45,480 --> 04:13:47,360
Today is one of those days.

5537
04:13:51,360 --> 04:13:53,480
It's just one of those days.

5538
04:13:53,600 --> 04:13:55,960
I just need one win.

5539
04:14:00,860 --> 04:14:01,820
One win!

5540
04:14:12,160 --> 04:14:12,640
Okay.

5541
04:14:14,100 --> 04:14:14,580
Alright.

5542
04:14:15,320 --> 04:14:15,800
Namor.

5543
04:14:16,220 --> 04:14:19,760
I swear to God, if I see a Namor fucking gets through.

5544
04:14:19,980 --> 04:14:21,800
I swear to fucking God.

5545
04:14:21,980 --> 04:14:23,860
I don't even know if Gomez has streamer mode on.

5546
04:14:24,140 --> 04:14:25,220
Oh my God.

5547
04:14:25,540 --> 04:14:27,420
I hope he puts streamer mode on.

5548
04:14:27,980 --> 04:14:30,080
I swear to God, if Starlord... Oh, thank God.

5549
04:14:30,160 --> 04:14:33,020
If Starlord is the second ban, I swear to fucking God.

5550
04:14:33,020 --> 04:14:35,560
I'm just gonna be put on streamer mode right now.

5551
04:14:36,600 --> 04:14:38,500
I am not here to get targeted.

5552
04:14:40,620 --> 04:14:43,160
When you're grouped up with someone, you don't see it.

5553
04:14:43,460 --> 04:14:46,400
In your group, you don't know if they're in streamer mode or not.

5554
04:14:46,480 --> 04:14:47,420
Wait, we're batting Adam?

5555
04:14:47,840 --> 04:14:49,400
Are we actually batting Adam?

5556
04:14:49,460 --> 04:14:51,000
I hope I win the 20%.

5557
04:14:51,000 --> 04:14:51,880
I don't care.

5558
04:14:54,220 --> 04:14:54,660
Yay!

5559
04:14:59,440 --> 04:15:01,280
I think they're gonna yell at me now.

5560
04:15:08,080 --> 04:15:08,720
Yay!

5561
04:15:09,600 --> 04:15:11,340
And before they yell at me.

5562
04:15:14,560 --> 04:15:20,000
I'm so ready for them to yell at me for winning the 20%.

5563
04:15:22,780 --> 04:15:24,420
There goes my luck.

5564
04:15:25,180 --> 04:15:27,200
We're so gonna get yelled at now.

5565
04:15:29,040 --> 04:15:31,500
We're so gonna get yelled at.

5566
04:15:31,760 --> 04:15:33,520
It is what it is.

5567
04:15:37,540 --> 04:15:38,220
Yipee!

5568
04:15:40,460 --> 04:15:42,000
There goes my luck.

5569
04:15:42,080 --> 04:15:43,300
I shouldn't talk in this game.

5570
04:15:45,320 --> 04:15:48,220
I already caused the first disruption.

5571
04:15:48,960 --> 04:15:51,500
I am not talking in this game now.

5572
04:15:51,680 --> 04:15:52,840
I am not.

5573
04:15:53,700 --> 04:15:55,000
I'm scared.

5574
04:15:55,400 --> 04:15:56,380
I'm scared.

5575
04:15:58,740 --> 04:16:00,820
I'm not talking in this game.

5576
04:16:00,820 --> 04:16:04,220
I don't think they're happy that I won the 20% chat.

5577
04:16:07,920 --> 04:16:08,520
Great.

5578
04:16:09,360 --> 04:16:09,580
Alright.

5579
04:16:11,100 --> 04:16:12,000
Oh my god.

5580
04:16:12,040 --> 04:16:12,960
Mantis Luna.

5581
04:16:13,400 --> 04:16:15,360
We do not have enough heals here.

5582
04:16:16,000 --> 04:16:17,160
That's for sure.

5583
04:16:19,240 --> 04:16:20,960
Surely they went out ahead.

5584
04:16:21,340 --> 04:16:23,460
You know, I've already encountered so many losses.

5585
04:16:23,920 --> 04:16:26,960
Like, I'm... anything would be a pleasant surprise.

5586
04:16:30,980 --> 04:16:34,680
I'll be pleasantly surprised with whatever results we get.

5587
04:16:34,840 --> 04:16:36,860
You're alone, by the way.

5588
04:16:39,260 --> 04:16:41,040
I'd be pleasantly surprised.

5589
04:16:45,480 --> 04:16:46,520
Oh my god.

5590
04:16:46,520 --> 04:16:46,980
Oh my god.

5591
04:16:47,040 --> 04:16:47,260
Alone.

5592
04:16:48,420 --> 04:16:49,780
Alright, here we go.

5593
04:16:54,860 --> 04:16:55,380
Okay, I'm here.

5594
04:16:55,380 --> 04:16:55,920
I'm almost out of health.

5595
04:16:56,640 --> 04:16:57,220
You guys win.

5596
04:16:57,300 --> 04:16:57,700
You guys win.

5597
04:16:59,500 --> 04:16:59,940
Okay.

5598
04:16:59,940 --> 04:17:02,080
Okay, I'll only start talking.

5599
04:17:02,200 --> 04:17:03,360
There's a Psylocke up top.

5600
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:05,720
I'm going to stand top right.

5601
04:17:11,960 --> 04:17:12,980
I'm standing invis.

5602
04:17:13,240 --> 04:17:13,720
Invis dies.

5603
04:17:14,820 --> 04:17:16,000
Oh no, I talked.

5604
04:17:16,600 --> 04:17:17,520
They know I...

5605
04:17:17,520 --> 04:17:18,180
They know now.

5606
04:17:18,580 --> 04:17:19,740
There's a Psylocke behind me.

5607
04:17:19,740 --> 04:17:20,540
Psylocke behind me, please.

5608
04:17:25,700 --> 04:17:26,660
I'm sad.

5609
04:17:27,560 --> 04:17:28,580
I'm so sad.

5610
04:17:30,160 --> 04:17:31,620
I'm so sad.

5611
04:17:32,940 --> 04:17:34,340
I got Psylocked.

5612
04:17:35,040 --> 04:17:35,800
It's fine.

5613
04:17:37,160 --> 04:17:38,140
It's fine.

5614
04:17:38,920 --> 04:17:40,260
There was nothing I could do.

5615
04:17:40,520 --> 04:17:43,440
The Psylocke chose me to die and I was like, okay.

5616
04:17:46,160 --> 04:17:50,440
I was like, that's my life now.

5617
04:17:51,120 --> 04:17:52,160
That's my life.

5618
04:17:54,360 --> 04:17:55,540
Psylocke is a cheater.

5619
04:17:55,760 --> 04:17:56,760
No, he's not.

5620
04:17:56,860 --> 04:17:57,040
Nah.

5621
04:17:57,380 --> 04:17:57,980
No, he's not.

5622
04:17:58,260 --> 04:17:59,020
Yeah, he is.

5623
04:17:59,120 --> 04:17:59,780
Yeah, he is.

5624
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:02,780
You know, because DinaeQ is...

5625
04:18:02,780 --> 04:18:05,280
Yeah, DinaeQ is with this guy all the time.

5626
04:18:07,200 --> 04:18:11,180
I think he's actually cheating.

5627
04:18:11,400 --> 04:18:11,980
Yeah, he is.

5628
04:18:12,080 --> 04:18:12,260
Really?

5629
04:18:13,100 --> 04:18:14,300
Oh, that's interesting.

5630
04:18:17,920 --> 04:18:18,860
He'll be ready to damage boost me.

5631
04:18:18,940 --> 04:18:19,680
That's what I call it.

5632
04:18:22,720 --> 04:18:23,320
Let's go.

5633
04:18:23,720 --> 04:18:24,220
Can you damage boost me?

5634
04:18:24,440 --> 04:18:25,760
Yeah, damage boost me, damage boost me.

5635
04:18:26,460 --> 04:18:27,300
I got two, I got two.

5636
04:18:28,640 --> 04:18:29,880
It's all on me, by the way.

5637
04:18:30,300 --> 04:18:31,320
Nah, nah, it's all on me.

5638
04:18:31,560 --> 04:18:32,740
Hey, did your team win, Andrew?

5639
04:18:34,520 --> 04:18:37,200
We won four games out of seven.

5640
04:18:37,660 --> 04:18:39,420
Bro, all seven games have been almost banned, by the way.

5641
04:18:39,500 --> 04:18:39,840
I didn't play.

5642
04:18:40,740 --> 04:18:41,120
Yes.

5643
04:18:47,120 --> 04:18:48,100
Nice shield, dude.

5644
04:18:50,360 --> 04:18:50,740
Which?

5645
04:18:52,260 --> 04:18:52,920
You, bro.

5646
04:18:53,920 --> 04:18:55,440
I'm not in this.

5647
04:18:56,340 --> 04:18:56,920
Yeah, I know.

5648
04:19:00,980 --> 04:19:02,020
I need heals.

5649
04:19:04,640 --> 04:19:05,640
I got cooked.

5650
04:19:07,960 --> 04:19:08,360
Nice.

5651
04:19:23,530 --> 04:19:24,770
Can we go with Mantis ult?

5652
04:19:25,730 --> 04:19:26,390
Like, hard deep.

5653
04:19:27,430 --> 04:19:28,170
Yeah, I can go whenever.

5654
04:19:28,270 --> 04:19:28,490
Are you ready?

5655
04:19:28,710 --> 04:19:29,010
Yeah.

5656
04:19:29,170 --> 04:19:31,350
I'm grappling in three, two, one.

5657
04:19:31,350 --> 04:19:32,270
Did you have bubble?

5658
04:19:34,130 --> 04:19:34,550
I'm okay.

5659
04:19:35,470 --> 04:19:36,210
Luna dies.

5660
04:19:36,610 --> 04:19:38,390
These guys just melt me in one second.

5661
04:19:45,860 --> 04:19:47,100
I need reload, I need reload.

5662
04:19:52,340 --> 04:19:54,340
I don't know, I probably might die whenever I come in, I'm sorry.

5663
04:19:55,640 --> 04:19:56,480
First range.

5664
04:19:59,620 --> 04:20:00,920
I have a Psylocke ult.

5665
04:20:08,470 --> 04:20:09,310
I mean...

5666
04:20:09,310 --> 04:20:10,750
You should only have Scarlet and ult, right?

5667
04:20:13,890 --> 04:20:15,450
And I guess Invis ult.

5668
04:20:16,530 --> 04:20:17,590
I think I have...

5669
04:20:18,230 --> 04:20:18,850
Bust support.

5670
04:20:19,670 --> 04:20:20,030
Yeah.

5671
04:20:26,640 --> 04:20:27,400
I'm summoning Bust support.

5672
04:20:28,840 --> 04:20:29,320
Yeah, bro.

5673
04:20:30,440 --> 04:20:31,900
Bro, I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.

5674
04:20:32,720 --> 04:20:36,140
I mean, they have Scarlet, so...

5675
04:20:37,890 --> 04:20:39,350
I can look for summon fire, but...

5676
04:20:40,150 --> 04:20:40,630
I love you.

5677
04:20:40,810 --> 04:20:43,290
I'm going in three, two, one, summoning Bust support.

5678
04:20:43,290 --> 04:20:43,370
Bust support.

5679
04:20:45,790 --> 04:20:47,010
I have to help this.

5680
04:20:54,110 --> 04:20:55,310
Damage boosting, damage boosting.

5681
04:20:56,250 --> 04:20:57,410
I'm gonna Invis, I'm gonna Invis.

5682
04:21:01,750 --> 04:21:02,730
We're gonna Invis ult.

5683
04:21:09,890 --> 04:21:11,550
I'm gonna summon ult.

5684
04:21:12,290 --> 04:21:13,410
Wait, I'm summoning Bust support.

5685
04:21:13,610 --> 04:21:13,970
I'm on Luna.

5686
04:21:16,830 --> 04:21:18,070
Oh my god.

5687
04:21:18,070 --> 04:21:19,070
I cannot survive.

5688
04:21:24,430 --> 04:21:24,790
Mito!

5689
04:21:25,550 --> 04:21:26,790
Oh my god, I was so close.

5690
04:21:28,370 --> 04:21:29,210
I was so close.

5691
04:21:29,350 --> 04:21:30,930
I thought I was fucked up.

5692
04:21:32,070 --> 04:21:32,630
What was that?

5693
04:21:35,290 --> 04:21:36,570
I'm gonna summon backline and go now.

5694
04:21:36,670 --> 04:21:36,990
Bust support.

5695
04:21:38,350 --> 04:21:39,210
I don't have grapple to get up.

5696
04:21:39,330 --> 04:21:40,030
I'm guessing to walk.

5697
04:21:42,070 --> 04:21:43,170
There's someone behind me, there's someone.

5698
04:21:43,330 --> 04:21:43,490
Oh.

5699
04:21:45,470 --> 04:21:48,370
I'm always just getting sidelocked.

5700
04:21:48,430 --> 04:21:50,770
Big boom.

5701
04:21:50,970 --> 04:21:52,170
Big boom.

5702
04:21:52,370 --> 04:21:55,470
The hard targeting.

5703
04:21:55,910 --> 04:22:02,490
That's interesting, because Blessed has three different accounts in top 500.

5704
04:22:03,230 --> 04:22:08,650
And if he is actually a hacker, that is very interesting.

5705
04:22:09,430 --> 04:22:10,850
Because I know who he plays with.

5706
04:22:20,810 --> 04:22:21,750
I'm going in three, two, one.

5707
04:22:21,770 --> 04:22:23,150
I'm going in three, two, one.

5708
04:22:26,270 --> 04:22:26,850
He's one.

5709
04:22:42,670 --> 04:22:44,710
Sorry, can't keep you up.

5710
04:22:45,390 --> 04:22:45,750
No!

5711
04:22:49,900 --> 04:22:51,680
So they're calling him out as a hack.

5712
04:22:51,740 --> 04:22:52,580
I know who exactly...

5713
04:22:53,120 --> 04:22:53,520
I don't know.

5714
04:22:53,680 --> 04:22:55,240
Nobody knows who he is, by the way.

5715
04:22:55,320 --> 04:22:55,840
Nobody knows.

5716
04:22:56,000 --> 04:22:58,000
We've asked pro players around who he is.

5717
04:22:58,100 --> 04:22:59,220
But no one knows who he is.

5718
04:22:59,340 --> 04:23:01,080
We just know he's a...

5719
04:23:01,080 --> 04:23:01,800
Yeah, I was in here.

5720
04:23:02,360 --> 04:23:03,180
I can ult first.

5721
04:23:04,740 --> 04:23:07,060
If I survive my slam for longer than one second.

5722
04:23:12,000 --> 04:23:13,760
Can we match it with Luna, please?

5723
04:23:14,260 --> 04:23:14,720
Yeah, oh.

5724
04:23:15,240 --> 04:23:16,000
I can, I can.

5725
04:23:16,100 --> 04:23:16,240
Oh.

5726
04:23:16,300 --> 04:23:16,680
Big boom.

5727
04:23:17,320 --> 04:23:18,240
Oh, yeah.

5728
04:23:19,000 --> 04:23:19,660
I couldn't.

5729
04:23:19,740 --> 04:23:20,720
I got strangled, dude.

5730
04:23:21,840 --> 04:23:22,660
Nah, it's fine, it's fine.

5731
04:23:23,100 --> 04:23:23,600
It's still winnable.

5732
04:23:24,900 --> 04:23:26,200
Probably just gonna solo the Luna.

5733
04:23:28,620 --> 04:23:29,520
You don't have heals.

5734
04:23:30,040 --> 04:23:30,560
Don't, don't do this.

5735
04:23:30,560 --> 04:23:31,280
I can't, she's running.

5736
04:23:32,900 --> 04:23:33,700
I already saw one fight.

5737
04:23:36,120 --> 04:23:36,920
They used...

5738
04:23:36,920 --> 04:23:37,540
Solo, solo.

5739
04:23:37,680 --> 04:23:38,040
You got solo.

5740
04:23:40,660 --> 04:23:42,220
Okay, I don't have any shields, though.

5741
04:23:42,600 --> 04:23:44,120
Yeah, yeah, you can...

5742
04:23:48,160 --> 04:23:49,300
I'm soloing backline now.

5743
04:23:56,350 --> 04:23:57,490
Mag dies, mag dies, mag dies.

5744
04:23:58,490 --> 04:23:58,810
Nice.

5745
04:24:01,090 --> 04:24:04,350
I can slam backline in 3, 2, 1.

5746
04:24:04,510 --> 04:24:06,850
Probably just gonna solo this.

5747
04:24:06,930 --> 04:24:07,190
I can't die.

5748
04:24:08,070 --> 04:24:09,090
Probably just die instantly.

5749
04:24:09,310 --> 04:24:09,730
I can't.

5750
04:24:09,870 --> 04:24:10,670
I actually can't.

5751
04:24:10,670 --> 04:24:12,090
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

5752
04:24:12,710 --> 04:24:14,230
They have Scarlet, that's why.

5753
04:24:17,530 --> 04:24:18,630
I'm gonna have to use it.

5754
04:24:23,100 --> 04:24:24,360
I'm TPing for you guys.

5755
04:24:24,860 --> 04:24:25,380
Somebody died.

5756
04:24:29,040 --> 04:24:30,300
I don't have it, I don't have it anymore.

5757
04:24:31,060 --> 04:24:32,320
Mag, mag got grappled, dude.

5758
04:24:32,760 --> 04:24:33,520
Mag won, mag won!

5759
04:24:35,100 --> 04:24:35,580
Kill it.

5760
04:24:38,100 --> 04:24:38,680
One, one.

5761
04:24:40,420 --> 04:24:40,880
Oh.

5762
04:24:42,860 --> 04:24:44,360
We should have Scarlet all here.

5763
04:24:44,760 --> 04:24:48,100
Invis one, invis one!

5764
04:24:48,920 --> 04:24:49,900
Luna, luna, luna behind!

5765
04:24:50,180 --> 04:24:50,780
Nice, nice.

5766
04:24:51,020 --> 04:24:51,380
Nice.

5767
04:24:53,340 --> 04:24:54,900
Kog'Maw's here, mic's not working.

5768
04:24:55,140 --> 04:24:55,860
I'll drool.

5769
04:24:56,340 --> 04:24:56,760
I'll try to drool.

5770
04:24:56,840 --> 04:24:58,380
Go, mag, go, go, go.

5771
04:24:58,880 --> 04:24:59,420
What the fuck?

5772
04:25:00,020 --> 04:25:00,840
Go, mag, go, go.

5773
04:25:01,500 --> 04:25:02,000
Shut up, DRB.

5774
04:25:02,020 --> 04:25:02,280
Help him.

5775
04:25:02,900 --> 04:25:03,300
Help him.

5776
04:25:03,880 --> 04:25:04,180
Oh!

5777
04:25:06,100 --> 04:25:08,360
He's mid behind review!

5778
04:25:11,560 --> 04:25:11,980
Damn.

5779
04:25:24,840 --> 04:25:26,360
I never stop.

5780
04:25:26,880 --> 04:25:29,680
Bro, you keep saying they have Scarlet, but Scarlet does tickle damage, no?

5781
04:25:30,620 --> 04:25:33,420
But her E, it's like...

5782
04:25:33,420 --> 04:25:33,840
Yeah, but no.

5783
04:25:34,360 --> 04:25:35,140
Yeah, yeah, no.

5784
04:25:36,140 --> 04:25:37,420
Wait, so what's...

5785
04:25:38,120 --> 04:25:39,540
What's leading you then?

5786
04:25:41,380 --> 04:25:42,580
I don't know, bro.

5787
04:25:42,940 --> 04:25:44,560
Maybe the sword, bro?

5788
04:25:44,720 --> 04:25:45,320
I don't fucking know.

5789
04:25:45,320 --> 04:25:46,940
Maybe it's just a mag, punching you.

5790
04:25:48,040 --> 04:25:49,100
Maybe it's just a mag.

5791
04:25:50,940 --> 04:25:52,460
Maybe it's just skill death.

5792
04:25:56,760 --> 04:25:58,300
I think it's the Psylocke.

5793
04:25:58,520 --> 04:25:59,060
She always shoots at you.

5794
04:25:59,460 --> 04:26:00,360
She never goes...

5795
04:26:00,360 --> 04:26:02,100
Yeah, I think she's just pretty much spamming you, bro.

5796
04:26:02,360 --> 04:26:02,640
Honestly.

5797
04:26:03,540 --> 04:26:04,500
I think she thinks so.

5798
04:26:06,640 --> 04:26:07,080
Why?

5799
04:26:07,520 --> 04:26:07,780
Why?

5800
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:09,880
Bro, like...

5801
04:26:09,880 --> 04:26:11,580
Maybe it's Linkzr's ult.

5802
04:26:11,840 --> 04:26:12,700
Yeah, like...

5803
04:26:12,700 --> 04:26:13,080
Oh, really?

5804
04:26:13,380 --> 04:26:14,420
Even Sinatraa said it.

5805
04:26:15,420 --> 04:26:16,940
Like, the guy...

5806
04:26:16,940 --> 04:26:17,280
I don't know.

5807
04:26:17,700 --> 04:26:18,840
Is this a full...

5808
04:26:18,840 --> 04:26:20,260
Is this an EU stack?

5809
04:26:20,500 --> 04:26:21,340
I'm pretty sure.

5810
04:26:23,160 --> 04:26:24,920
It's a full European stack.

5811
04:26:26,380 --> 04:26:27,880
And it's just me and Gomez.

5812
04:26:28,060 --> 04:26:28,560
The NA.

5813
04:26:29,220 --> 04:26:29,740
In NA.

5814
04:26:29,860 --> 04:26:30,460
Yeah, they're TPing.

5815
04:26:30,840 --> 04:26:31,500
They're TPing, bye.

5816
04:26:34,060 --> 04:26:35,320
I'm gonna somebody block out.

5817
04:26:35,920 --> 04:26:36,740
I don't wanna fucking die here.

5818
04:26:36,740 --> 04:26:37,400
They won't look out.

5819
04:26:37,580 --> 04:26:37,960
They won't.

5820
04:26:38,840 --> 04:26:39,700
What the fuck is...

5821
04:26:39,700 --> 04:26:41,320
I didn't turn inside then, but I'm gonna fucking die.

5822
04:26:41,380 --> 04:26:42,000
I'm gonna bubble you up.

5823
04:26:42,700 --> 04:26:43,220
You ready?

5824
04:26:43,260 --> 04:26:43,840
Yeah, just one sec.

5825
04:26:44,800 --> 04:26:45,300
Oh my god.

5826
04:26:46,460 --> 04:26:47,760
Oh my god.

5827
04:26:48,360 --> 04:26:49,840
Like, you have to, like, do something.

5828
04:26:52,800 --> 04:26:54,680
But I can't.

5829
04:26:58,380 --> 04:26:59,380
TP, I touch.

5830
04:27:00,740 --> 04:27:01,140
Pots.

5831
04:27:01,440 --> 04:27:01,700
Alright.

5832
04:27:02,120 --> 04:27:02,480
Alright.

5833
04:27:02,840 --> 04:27:04,280
I can touch last second, which hurts.

5834
04:27:04,480 --> 04:27:05,960
I think it's really useless, though.

5835
04:27:06,780 --> 04:27:07,420
No, no, try it.

5836
04:27:07,420 --> 04:27:08,420
He's doing it, he's doing it.

5837
04:27:09,700 --> 04:27:11,320
I'm fucking insta-dead, bye bye.

5838
04:27:13,140 --> 04:27:14,380
Winable, winable, winable, winable.

5839
04:27:14,780 --> 04:27:15,580
It's so winnable.

5840
04:27:15,660 --> 04:27:16,740
I think I should just go Mantis.

5841
04:27:17,760 --> 04:27:18,040
No.

5842
04:27:20,840 --> 04:27:22,040
Bro, I don't fucking know how to play.

5843
04:27:22,040 --> 04:27:23,040
Andrew, just play Menno.

5844
04:27:25,540 --> 04:27:26,620
I'm gonna set backline in three.

5845
04:27:26,780 --> 04:27:27,320
Come on, setting everyone?

5846
04:27:27,460 --> 04:27:27,700
Big time.

5847
04:27:30,520 --> 04:27:31,960
I don't think I can get all the time.

5848
04:27:33,560 --> 04:27:34,300
You can maybe get it.

5849
04:27:34,960 --> 04:27:36,560
I'm just AFK in front right now, they're not capping.

5850
04:27:36,740 --> 04:27:38,620
Yeah, but I can't, the tanks are blocking us.

5851
04:27:38,940 --> 04:27:39,640
I got it, I got it.

5852
04:27:39,900 --> 04:27:40,480
I'm pushing up.

5853
04:27:41,500 --> 04:27:42,140
You ready, you ready?

5854
04:27:42,260 --> 04:27:42,920
Wait, wait, wait.

5855
04:27:42,920 --> 04:27:43,800
Yeah.

5856
04:27:44,740 --> 04:27:45,280
Now.

5857
04:27:48,660 --> 04:27:49,980
No, is that strange?

5858
04:27:55,120 --> 04:27:58,020
Yeah, who said it was a bad idea?

5859
04:27:58,180 --> 04:27:58,840
Who said that?

5860
04:27:59,220 --> 04:27:59,720
Yeah, Andrew.

5861
04:28:00,300 --> 04:28:00,840
Andrew!

5862
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:05,740
Damn,

5863
04:28:09,080 --> 04:28:09,460
Andrew.

5864
04:28:09,580 --> 04:28:11,080
I can't believe you said it was a bad idea.

5865
04:28:13,520 --> 04:28:14,800
Zero out of ten, RageVader.

5866
04:28:14,940 --> 04:28:15,560
Zero out of ten.

5867
04:28:16,520 --> 04:28:18,060
Why do you think I'm playing Rink?

5868
04:28:18,080 --> 04:28:19,700
I want to win at something.

5869
04:28:23,580 --> 04:28:25,940
I'm gonna set backline.

5870
04:28:29,560 --> 04:28:32,460
I got an invis, I got an invis.

5871
04:28:32,640 --> 04:28:33,500
Finally, I got someone.

5872
04:28:36,280 --> 04:28:37,100
Oh, no.

5873
04:28:37,300 --> 04:28:37,580
Okay.

5874
04:28:40,920 --> 04:28:42,200
We're missing Bucky, but it's fine.

5875
04:28:42,200 --> 04:28:43,620
They only have Luna heals.

5876
04:28:44,360 --> 04:28:45,500
I'm summoning Luna right now.

5877
04:28:47,560 --> 04:28:48,740
We can't melee you from here.

5878
04:28:49,500 --> 04:28:51,040
I got her, I got her, I got her.

5879
04:28:51,320 --> 04:28:52,160
Come back DRP you.

5880
04:28:53,060 --> 04:28:53,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5881
04:28:53,760 --> 04:28:54,220
You're by yourself.

5882
04:28:54,440 --> 04:28:55,160
We're trying to catch you up.

5883
04:28:56,840 --> 04:28:58,700
Yeah, DRP on Train is crazy, though.

5884
04:28:59,440 --> 04:29:00,000
I see.

5885
04:29:00,180 --> 04:29:00,780
That is crazy.

5886
04:29:08,020 --> 04:29:09,500
Can we just kill the fucking...

5887
04:29:09,500 --> 04:29:10,880
There's a Mag that's by himself.

5888
04:29:12,340 --> 04:29:13,480
I'm just landing backline, guys.

5889
04:29:13,520 --> 04:29:14,680
You guys can try to kill the tanks.

5890
04:29:17,460 --> 04:29:18,500
Oh, Mag low, Mag low.

5891
04:29:23,780 --> 04:29:24,240
I'm here.

5892
04:29:25,440 --> 04:29:26,060
They might TP.

5893
04:29:26,780 --> 04:29:27,540
We can get...

5894
04:29:27,540 --> 04:29:28,840
If I'm Luna ult here, if I'm Luna ult...

5895
04:29:28,840 --> 04:29:30,620
Yeah, I'm 70%, I'm 70%.

5896
04:29:33,980 --> 04:29:34,260
90.

5897
04:29:36,720 --> 04:29:38,480
90, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

5898
04:29:42,320 --> 04:29:43,880
I'll be back in action soon.

5899
04:29:43,960 --> 04:29:45,420
I can use DRP, but...

5900
04:29:45,420 --> 04:29:45,640
I know.

5901
04:29:47,280 --> 04:29:48,200
No, no, wait, wait.

5902
04:29:48,200 --> 04:29:49,200
Bring top right again.

5903
04:29:49,460 --> 04:29:50,420
He's gonna get booped, bro.

5904
04:29:50,580 --> 04:29:51,280
Let's like...

5905
04:29:51,280 --> 04:29:51,720
Yeah, I know.

5906
04:29:51,780 --> 04:29:52,540
We're fighting on point.

5907
04:29:59,240 --> 04:29:59,940
Oh, my god.

5908
04:30:02,820 --> 04:30:03,820
I'm coming in!

5909
04:30:03,840 --> 04:30:04,500
Not ult, Luna.

5910
04:30:04,720 --> 04:30:05,380
Yeah, I got it, I'm running.

5911
04:30:05,480 --> 04:30:06,900
I mean, you can try to do it, but...

5912
04:30:07,360 --> 04:30:08,400
I don't know where that is.

5913
04:30:08,920 --> 04:30:09,900
I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm okay.

5914
04:30:09,940 --> 04:30:10,700
We can do it, bro.

5915
04:30:10,720 --> 04:30:12,000
They're all high ground, they're all high ground.

5916
04:30:12,080 --> 04:30:12,800
He's gonna solo the Luna.

5917
04:30:12,800 --> 04:30:15,040
3, 2, 1.

5918
04:30:16,040 --> 04:30:17,400
I can't dodge, I'm okay.

5919
04:30:18,000 --> 04:30:18,740
I froze Jhin.

5920
04:30:18,940 --> 04:30:19,640
I'm almost back, I'm almost back.

5921
04:30:22,380 --> 04:30:22,820
I can try...

5922
04:30:23,380 --> 04:30:24,420
After Luna, I was like, I'm gonna just...

5923
04:30:24,420 --> 04:30:25,240
Yeah, I'm almost back.

5924
04:30:27,040 --> 04:30:27,500
Wait, Kim.

5925
04:30:27,660 --> 04:30:28,420
We almost have...

5926
04:30:28,420 --> 04:30:29,520
We almost have invis-ult.

5927
04:30:31,360 --> 04:30:32,100
Come on, Desi, bro.

5928
04:30:32,440 --> 04:30:33,220
You're on top of me, Desi.

5929
04:30:34,180 --> 04:30:34,860
Desi, come on, bro.

5930
04:30:35,440 --> 04:30:36,160
I can dodge, I can dodge.

5931
04:30:36,200 --> 04:30:36,700
Nice, Kim.

5932
04:30:37,000 --> 04:30:37,280
Nice!

5933
04:30:37,960 --> 04:30:38,440
I'm back.

5934
04:30:38,620 --> 04:30:40,060
We're gonna be on point, we're gonna be on point, we're gonna be on point.

5935
04:30:41,300 --> 04:30:42,020
Jhin, Jhin, Jhin, Jhin, Jhin.

5936
04:30:42,020 --> 04:30:45,060
He's alone, he's alone, he's alone.

5937
04:30:47,800 --> 04:30:48,980
I'm dodging, I'm dodging, I'm dodging.

5938
04:30:49,140 --> 04:30:50,180
I got you guys, I got you guys.

5939
04:30:50,380 --> 04:30:51,180
It's just...

5940
04:30:51,180 --> 04:30:52,180
It's strange, it's strange.

5941
04:30:54,280 --> 04:30:55,040
Let's go!

5942
04:30:55,880 --> 04:30:57,060
Wait, now it's 1-10.

5943
04:30:57,200 --> 04:30:57,780
Let's go.

5944
04:31:00,740 --> 04:31:02,480
Thanks for the 1-10, Andrew.

5945
04:31:02,920 --> 04:31:04,120
Oh, finally.

5946
04:31:09,380 --> 04:31:12,680
We did it!

5947
04:31:13,060 --> 04:31:14,780
1-10!

5948
04:31:17,460 --> 04:31:18,740
Yes!

5949
04:31:18,800 --> 04:31:21,200
All we needed was Europeans.

5950
04:31:23,580 --> 04:31:28,540
We just needed Europeans on our team.

5951
04:31:29,120 --> 04:31:30,340
That's it!

5952
04:31:31,130 --> 04:31:32,620
Oh my god!

5953
04:31:34,860 --> 04:31:36,480
We just...

5954
04:31:36,480 --> 04:31:37,710
We just needed...

5955
04:31:37,900 --> 04:31:39,600
We just needed Europeans.

5956
04:31:40,060 --> 04:31:41,630
The curse is broken.

5957
04:31:42,640 --> 04:31:44,340
Oh my god!

5958
04:31:49,180 --> 04:31:51,480
Oh my god.

5959
04:31:53,110 --> 04:31:54,100
We did it.

5960
04:31:54,720 --> 04:31:55,920
We did it, guys.

5961
04:31:56,180 --> 04:31:57,670
The EU buff succeeded.

5962
04:32:00,340 --> 04:32:02,760
Oh my god, the EU buff.

5963
04:32:02,960 --> 04:32:03,640
Let's go!

5964
04:32:04,400 --> 04:32:05,880
That's all we needed.

5965
04:32:11,200 --> 04:32:12,620
Oh my god.

5966
04:32:13,700 --> 04:32:14,900
We did it.

5967
04:32:16,000 --> 04:32:17,960
That was not the problem!

5968
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:19,860
Let's go!

5969
04:32:20,860 --> 04:32:22,540
Not the problem!

5970
04:32:25,500 --> 04:32:27,700
That's all I ever wanted.

5971
04:32:28,980 --> 04:32:31,700
It was never my fault, guys.

5972
04:32:32,020 --> 04:32:35,100
It was never my fault.

5973
04:32:35,220 --> 04:32:37,480
It was the NA team.

5974
04:32:37,840 --> 04:32:38,900
No, no, no, no, no.

5975
04:32:38,940 --> 04:32:40,500
It was not, guys.

5976
04:32:40,600 --> 04:32:41,800
It was not NA.

5977
04:32:42,520 --> 04:32:47,100
It was just that we had EU players with hands, guys.

5978
04:32:47,320 --> 04:32:50,660
We just had players who had hands.

5979
04:32:50,840 --> 04:32:53,000
And that's all that matters.

5980
04:32:53,580 --> 04:32:55,140
You were never the problem.

5981
04:32:55,420 --> 04:32:56,500
Oh my god.

5982
04:32:56,560 --> 04:32:57,680
They actually had hands!

5983
04:32:57,700 --> 04:32:58,380
They actually had hands!

5984
04:33:02,380 --> 04:33:03,960
Oh my god.

5985
04:33:04,000 --> 04:33:05,540
We were there, everybody.

5986
04:33:06,160 --> 04:33:08,080
We were fucking there.

5987
04:33:08,360 --> 04:33:11,040
For a great moment in life.

5988
04:33:15,680 --> 04:33:17,860
Oh my god.

5989
04:33:18,400 --> 04:33:20,940
Oh my god.

5990
04:33:21,060 --> 04:33:22,560
It's actually crazy.

5991
04:33:23,060 --> 04:33:27,040
I can't believe they actually had hands, guys.

5992
04:33:29,040 --> 04:33:29,860
Oh my god.

5993
04:33:29,860 --> 04:33:30,870
We take those!

5994
04:33:31,900 --> 04:33:33,930
We take those.

5995
04:33:38,300 --> 04:33:40,140
Oh my god.

5996
04:33:41,220 --> 04:33:41,720
Damn.

5997
04:33:41,940 --> 04:33:43,020
We were there, guys.

5998
04:33:43,320 --> 04:33:44,600
We were fucking there.

5999
04:33:45,500 --> 04:33:46,420
That's crazy.

6000
04:33:46,700 --> 04:33:47,940
I'm just happy in life.

6001
04:33:48,400 --> 04:33:49,140
You know what?

6002
04:33:49,240 --> 04:33:50,880
Now I'm happy again.

6003
04:33:53,420 --> 04:33:57,110
Now I can feel joy again.

6004
04:33:57,700 --> 04:33:58,860
Now I...

6005
04:34:02,580 --> 04:34:02,920
Yippee!

6006
04:34:03,980 --> 04:34:05,140
Who's Desley?

6007
04:34:05,460 --> 04:34:06,120
Is Desley the...

6008
04:34:06,120 --> 04:34:06,880
Oh my god.

6009
04:34:06,920 --> 04:34:08,360
Who the fuck is Desley?

6010
04:34:08,800 --> 04:34:09,740
I'm adding you.

6011
04:34:10,260 --> 04:34:11,740
I don't know who Desley is.

6012
04:34:12,260 --> 04:34:13,600
But you're cool in my book.

6013
04:34:15,800 --> 04:34:18,180
You're cool in my book.

6014
04:34:19,920 --> 04:34:20,600
Okay.

6015
04:34:21,060 --> 04:34:21,660
Desley.

6016
04:34:22,180 --> 04:34:23,040
Oh my god.

6017
04:34:23,200 --> 04:34:24,160
Desley's a gamer.

6018
04:34:24,860 --> 04:34:26,800
Joy has been restored, everybody.

6019
04:34:27,780 --> 04:34:29,620
Joy has been restored.

6020
04:34:29,760 --> 04:34:30,460
I don't know...

6021
04:34:30,460 --> 04:34:30,980
Okay.

6022
04:34:31,120 --> 04:34:32,580
So, the thing about Blessed...

6023
04:34:32,580 --> 04:34:32,820
Okay.

6024
04:34:32,900 --> 04:34:35,280
Let me show you guys all of his accounts.

6025
04:34:36,120 --> 04:34:37,440
So, the thing is...

6026
04:34:37,440 --> 04:34:40,120
Valentina has queued with Blessed.

6027
04:34:40,860 --> 04:34:41,860
That's why I was like...

6028
04:34:41,860 --> 04:34:44,060
I didn't think Blessed was hacking.

6029
04:34:44,800 --> 04:34:48,620
Because he has queued with several people that I know in the scene.

6030
04:34:49,020 --> 04:34:51,860
But we've asked around the pro players.

6031
04:34:52,480 --> 04:34:54,980
And nobody knows who he is.

6032
04:34:55,420 --> 04:34:56,660
Like, nobody knows who...

6033
04:34:56,660 --> 04:34:57,980
Other than like...

6034
04:34:57,980 --> 04:34:58,600
I think like...

6035
04:34:58,600 --> 04:34:59,320
Someone knows.

6036
04:34:59,440 --> 04:34:59,880
But like...

6037
04:34:59,880 --> 04:35:01,520
The pro players we've asked...

6038
04:35:01,520 --> 04:35:03,300
Has no idea who Blessed is.

6039
04:35:04,980 --> 04:35:07,220
So, Valentina has queued with Blessed.

6040
04:35:07,740 --> 04:35:08,660
And also like...

6041
04:35:09,320 --> 04:35:10,400
Oh my god.

6042
04:35:10,440 --> 04:35:11,080
We're with LG.

6043
04:35:11,780 --> 04:35:12,140
Okay.

6044
04:35:12,240 --> 04:35:14,340
We have the LG stack on our team.

6045
04:35:16,040 --> 04:35:16,520
No.

6046
04:35:16,620 --> 04:35:17,660
Tim is not number one.

6047
04:35:17,740 --> 04:35:18,200
It's Guru.

6048
04:35:18,660 --> 04:35:21,040
TimTheTatman gifted 150 subs.

6049
04:35:21,300 --> 04:35:24,520
So that the rank 1 guy will change his name to TimTheTatman.

6050
04:35:25,240 --> 04:35:26,260
I should do that.

6051
04:35:26,340 --> 04:35:27,140
I wanna do that.

6052
04:35:27,280 --> 04:35:28,160
I would be like...

6053
04:35:28,160 --> 04:35:30,520
I'll give you 200 subs if you do the same thing.

6054
04:35:41,340 --> 04:35:43,340
I'm just happy I'm not the problem.

6055
04:35:44,600 --> 04:35:45,700
That's really it.

6056
04:35:49,980 --> 04:35:50,440
Oh.

6057
04:35:53,760 --> 04:35:55,160
Well, it doesn't matter.

6058
04:36:00,280 --> 04:36:01,500
He's like...

6059
04:36:01,500 --> 04:36:02,340
Don't ban Groot.

6060
04:36:02,520 --> 04:36:02,840
Whoops.

6061
04:36:05,180 --> 04:36:06,800
Groot is for bums.

6062
04:36:08,700 --> 04:36:10,560
What do we ban then?

6063
04:36:11,400 --> 04:36:12,320
I don't know.

6064
04:36:12,920 --> 04:36:15,300
That's my usual go-to ban line.

6065
04:36:15,660 --> 04:36:17,480
Why is everybody banning Adam now?

6066
04:36:22,260 --> 04:36:23,620
Don't ban Groot.

6067
04:36:23,720 --> 04:36:24,560
Groot goes too.

6068
04:36:28,660 --> 04:36:29,760
I mean...

6069
04:36:29,760 --> 04:36:31,240
I could go Adam too.

6070
04:36:32,600 --> 04:36:33,420
Oh, okay.

6071
04:36:38,060 --> 04:36:39,120
I like Adam.

6072
04:36:39,460 --> 04:36:40,220
Adam's fun.

6073
04:36:40,980 --> 04:36:42,800
As a support player, I like Adam.

6074
04:36:44,020 --> 04:36:45,260
Is this the...

6075
04:36:45,260 --> 04:36:45,660
Oh, wait.

6076
04:36:45,680 --> 04:36:46,820
This is EU LG.

6077
04:36:47,200 --> 04:36:47,560
The fuck?

6078
04:36:47,640 --> 04:36:48,540
Why are they all here?

6079
04:36:49,440 --> 04:36:50,640
Where are the EU players?

6080
04:36:50,800 --> 04:36:51,820
This is EU LG.

6081
04:36:54,140 --> 04:36:55,020
I reckon...

6082
04:36:55,980 --> 04:36:57,000
What the fuck?

6083
04:36:57,160 --> 04:36:58,640
We have all the Europeans today.

6084
04:37:01,240 --> 04:37:02,960
But now I think they're great.

6085
04:37:06,520 --> 04:37:08,760
I'm so not used to it.

6086
04:37:10,000 --> 04:37:12,220
I'm so not used to it.

6087
04:37:13,940 --> 04:37:15,800
Can't believe Andrew was like...

6088
04:37:15,800 --> 04:37:16,640
You're 0-10.

6089
04:37:16,940 --> 04:37:18,080
I was like...

6090
04:37:18,080 --> 04:37:18,760
Who snitched?

6091
04:37:19,180 --> 04:37:20,520
Who told him?

6092
04:37:20,900 --> 04:37:22,980
Somebody in my chat...

6093
04:37:22,980 --> 04:37:24,760
Went to Andrew's chat...

6094
04:37:24,760 --> 04:37:25,460
And was like...

6095
04:37:25,460 --> 04:37:26,380
Doki's 0-10.

6096
04:37:26,560 --> 04:37:27,380
She needs this.

6097
04:37:27,820 --> 04:37:29,960
Somebody snitched on me.

6098
04:37:29,980 --> 04:37:30,980
That's so fucked.

6099
04:37:31,240 --> 04:37:33,340
I can't believe it.

6100
04:37:35,960 --> 04:37:37,960
Cause how else would he know?

6101
04:37:38,080 --> 04:37:41,120
Cause that includes my ranking too.

6102
04:37:41,720 --> 04:37:44,240
He fucking gave him my ranking score.

6103
04:37:45,340 --> 04:37:46,660
And he said 0-7.

6104
04:37:46,820 --> 04:37:47,420
I'd be like...

6105
04:37:47,420 --> 04:37:47,820
Yeah, no.

6106
04:37:47,960 --> 04:37:48,580
100%.

6107
04:37:48,580 --> 04:37:49,020
Yeah.

6108
04:37:51,740 --> 04:37:54,440
But the fact that he said 0-10...

6109
04:37:55,100 --> 04:37:57,240
Means that somebody fucking...

6110
04:37:57,240 --> 04:37:58,240
Fucking...

6111
04:38:00,560 --> 04:38:01,600
Somebody snitched.

6112
04:38:05,930 --> 04:38:06,450
Okay.

6113
04:38:13,010 --> 04:38:13,530
Okay.

6114
04:38:14,410 --> 04:38:15,530
That's fucked, guys.

6115
04:38:15,670 --> 04:38:16,330
Who was it?

6116
04:38:16,410 --> 04:38:17,330
Who was it?

6117
04:38:17,470 --> 04:38:18,910
Who the fuck was it?

6118
04:38:18,950 --> 04:38:20,850
I know it's one of you guys.

6119
04:38:25,740 --> 04:38:27,120
I push the cart.

6120
04:38:27,320 --> 04:38:28,800
I am a cart pusher.

6121
04:38:28,800 --> 04:38:30,780
I am a passenger princess.

6122
04:38:36,600 --> 04:38:37,680
There's...

6123
04:38:37,680 --> 04:38:38,240
There's...

6124
04:38:38,240 --> 04:38:39,360
Dang it.

6125
04:38:50,970 --> 04:38:53,850
You don't see that.

6126
04:38:56,370 --> 04:38:57,510
You go first, Mantis.

6127
04:39:00,330 --> 04:39:01,210
Oh, god.

6128
04:39:03,030 --> 04:39:03,910
Oh, I'm...

6129
04:39:03,910 --> 04:39:04,510
I need help.

6130
04:39:04,570 --> 04:39:04,970
I need help.

6131
04:39:08,410 --> 04:39:09,070
I'm okay.

6132
04:39:09,310 --> 04:39:10,190
There's a mag behind us.

6133
04:39:10,290 --> 04:39:10,610
There's a mag.

6134
04:39:12,930 --> 04:39:13,370
I think.

6135
04:39:14,990 --> 04:39:15,670
I have ult.

6136
04:39:19,570 --> 04:39:20,010
Two.

6137
04:39:27,170 --> 04:39:27,510
One.

6138
04:39:27,670 --> 04:39:27,970
No more.

6139
04:39:37,850 --> 04:39:38,690
Jesus Christ.

6140
04:39:38,690 --> 04:39:39,230
Jesus, guys.

6141
04:39:40,050 --> 04:39:41,230
You guys are gaming.

6142
04:39:45,890 --> 04:39:47,030
I have to reload.

6143
04:39:53,540 --> 04:39:54,200
I need heals.

6144
04:40:05,430 --> 04:40:09,610
I need heals here.

6145
04:40:16,270 --> 04:40:17,330
I froze him.

6146
04:40:18,850 --> 04:40:19,230
Thing is low.

6147
04:40:19,330 --> 04:40:20,050
Thing is so low.

6148
04:40:22,650 --> 04:40:23,610
We have nothing.

6149
04:40:25,530 --> 04:40:27,350
I got hit by it.

6150
04:40:34,710 --> 04:40:35,430
Starlord one.

6151
04:40:35,550 --> 04:40:36,050
Starlord one.

6152
04:40:39,770 --> 04:40:40,730
Jesus Christ.

6153
04:40:40,770 --> 04:40:42,150
This is a high elo, Gabi.

6154
04:40:51,430 --> 04:40:53,910
This is doom queuing hours.

6155
04:40:55,830 --> 04:40:58,170
Oh, I got shit on.

6156
04:40:58,990 --> 04:40:59,210
Yeah.

6157
04:41:04,090 --> 04:41:05,290
Feels bad, buddy.

6158
04:41:14,820 --> 04:41:16,800
I have to use this.

6159
04:41:21,510 --> 04:41:22,850
Oh, do you have shields?

6160
04:41:23,530 --> 04:41:23,830
Yes.

6161
04:41:29,770 --> 04:41:30,510
Thing is low.

6162
04:41:30,690 --> 04:41:31,070
Thing is low.

6163
04:41:31,170 --> 04:41:32,110
I have a Mantis with ult.

6164
04:41:37,420 --> 04:41:38,640
I have a match after.

6165
04:41:39,660 --> 04:41:40,520
I have a match.

6166
04:41:41,040 --> 04:41:42,120
I froze Mag.

6167
04:41:44,540 --> 04:41:45,560
Thing has ult here.

6168
04:41:46,100 --> 04:41:46,620
Thing has ult.

6169
04:41:46,840 --> 04:41:47,140
Thing has ult.

6170
04:41:49,580 --> 04:41:50,120
Mag slept.

6171
04:41:50,400 --> 04:41:51,260
Mag, Mag, Mag, Mag.

6172
04:41:51,300 --> 04:41:51,700
Mag, Mag.

6173
04:41:54,180 --> 04:41:54,580
Push him.

6174
04:41:54,660 --> 04:41:54,940
Push him.

6175
04:41:55,040 --> 04:41:55,340
Push him.

6176
04:41:57,160 --> 04:41:58,280
There's a Mantis to the right.

6177
04:42:01,520 --> 04:42:02,240
I can't get to you.

6178
04:42:02,960 --> 04:42:03,360
Freeze.

6179
04:42:17,840 --> 04:42:19,860
This is high elo.

6180
04:42:20,160 --> 04:42:21,260
This is definitely high elo.

6181
04:42:25,420 --> 04:42:27,440
Guys, this is high elo.

6182
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:33,180
This is absolutely high elo, nobbies.

6183
04:42:55,570 --> 04:42:56,890
Oh my god.

6184
04:42:57,150 --> 04:42:57,630
Sorry.

6185
04:42:58,610 --> 04:43:03,610
I thought he was going to go some other way, but he turned around.

6186
04:43:03,890 --> 04:43:04,630
Fucking crazy.

6187
04:43:07,710 --> 04:43:09,210
Oh my god.

6188
04:43:09,410 --> 04:43:09,650
Freak.

6189
04:43:09,870 --> 04:43:10,190
Freak.

6190
04:43:10,370 --> 04:43:10,730
Freak.

6191
04:43:12,510 --> 04:43:13,350
Actual freak.

6192
04:43:17,550 --> 04:43:18,790
Mantis, you can ult first.

6193
04:43:24,010 --> 04:43:24,290
Thing.

6194
04:43:24,450 --> 04:43:24,450
Thing.

6195
04:43:24,570 --> 04:43:24,750
Thing.

6196
04:43:25,030 --> 04:43:25,110
Thing.

6197
04:43:25,230 --> 04:43:25,230
Thing.

6198
04:43:25,230 --> 04:43:25,590
One.

6199
04:43:25,790 --> 04:43:25,790
One.

6200
04:43:26,010 --> 04:43:26,010
One.

6201
04:43:28,830 --> 04:43:29,530
Mag low.

6202
04:43:29,650 --> 04:43:29,930
Mag low.

6203
04:43:34,800 --> 04:43:35,200
Nice.

6204
04:43:38,000 --> 04:43:38,400
Goodbye.

6205
04:43:42,020 --> 04:43:42,760
Thing on point.

6206
04:43:42,880 --> 04:43:43,140
Thing low.

6207
04:43:43,200 --> 04:43:43,540
Thing low.

6208
04:43:49,180 --> 04:43:50,220
I push cart.

6209
04:43:54,670 --> 04:43:55,190
Thing one.

6210
04:43:55,330 --> 04:43:55,590
Thing one.

6211
04:43:55,770 --> 04:43:56,330
Actually one.

6212
04:43:56,590 --> 04:43:56,870
No link.

6213
04:43:59,570 --> 04:44:00,630
You guys didn't see that.

6214
04:44:02,170 --> 04:44:03,430
Guys, you guys did not see that.

6215
04:44:11,060 --> 04:44:12,720
You guys did not see that, guys.

6216
04:44:14,880 --> 04:44:16,440
You guys did not see that.

6217
04:44:17,860 --> 04:44:18,580
Don't die.

6218
04:44:18,700 --> 04:44:19,060
Use luna.

6219
04:44:19,320 --> 04:44:19,620
Use luna.

6220
04:44:19,620 --> 04:44:19,660
Use luna.

6221
04:44:19,720 --> 04:44:19,940
Okay.

6222
04:44:20,000 --> 04:44:20,200
Okay.

6223
04:44:20,220 --> 04:44:20,360
Okay.

6224
04:44:20,360 --> 04:44:20,660
I'm using.

6225
04:44:24,380 --> 04:44:24,740
Combo.

6226
04:44:24,960 --> 04:44:24,980
Combo.

6227
04:44:25,120 --> 04:44:25,340
Three.

6228
04:44:25,640 --> 04:44:25,980
Two.

6229
04:44:26,340 --> 04:44:26,500
One.

6230
04:44:26,500 --> 04:44:26,900
Dead damage.

6231
04:44:27,060 --> 04:44:27,920
Dead damage.

6232
04:44:33,230 --> 04:44:33,590
Mantis.

6233
04:44:33,630 --> 04:44:33,870
Mantis.

6234
04:44:33,930 --> 04:44:34,070
One.

6235
04:44:34,150 --> 04:44:34,290
One.

6236
04:44:34,330 --> 04:44:34,490
One.

6237
04:44:35,670 --> 04:44:36,190
In here.

6238
04:44:36,270 --> 04:44:36,430
In here.

6239
04:44:36,490 --> 04:44:37,030
I think in here.

6240
04:44:39,810 --> 04:44:40,110
Yeah.

6241
04:44:40,150 --> 04:44:40,630
Hold the control.

6242
04:44:40,730 --> 04:44:41,210
Hold the control.

6243
04:44:41,810 --> 04:44:42,670
It's hard for them to hold.

6244
04:44:43,350 --> 04:44:43,810
I'm frozen.

6245
04:44:46,310 --> 04:44:47,350
Oh, I couldn't.

6246
04:44:53,200 --> 04:44:53,980
Oh, hey.

6247
04:44:54,880 --> 04:44:55,640
Hello, buddy.

6248
04:44:58,600 --> 04:44:59,520
Mantis to the right.

6249
04:44:59,600 --> 04:45:00,120
Mantis healing.

6250
04:45:00,360 --> 04:45:00,800
Resing in here.

6251
04:45:05,360 --> 04:45:05,940
Thing frozen.

6252
04:45:09,160 --> 04:45:09,780
Thing one.

6253
04:45:09,960 --> 04:45:10,180
Thing one.

6254
04:45:11,000 --> 04:45:11,800
I'm hurt.

6255
04:45:13,460 --> 04:45:18,440
Guys, you didn't see me miss three shots on our star lord.

6256
04:45:18,560 --> 04:45:19,340
You didn't see that.

6257
04:45:20,380 --> 04:45:21,320
Guys, you didn't.

6258
04:45:21,460 --> 04:45:22,020
Guys, look.

6259
04:45:22,100 --> 04:45:23,280
I've been through a lot, guys.

6260
04:45:23,360 --> 04:45:23,540
Please.

6261
04:45:23,740 --> 04:45:23,920
I've been.

6262
04:45:26,140 --> 04:45:28,160
Guys, I've been through a lot.

6263
04:45:31,460 --> 04:45:32,360
If you do.

6264
04:45:32,480 --> 04:45:34,920
If I do not see it, you do not see it.

6265
04:45:36,940 --> 04:45:38,480
We've been through a lot.

6266
04:45:44,560 --> 04:45:45,200
Guys.

6267
04:45:47,980 --> 04:45:50,400
We all suffered today.

6268
04:45:55,160 --> 04:45:56,200
Guys, please.

6269
04:45:56,560 --> 04:45:57,000
Please.

6270
04:45:57,180 --> 04:46:02,640
You do not kick a puppy that is down and like is suffering a seizure at the moment.

6271
04:46:03,800 --> 04:46:06,020
Guys, that's so fucked up.

6272
04:46:06,020 --> 04:46:12,760
This puppy has lost the use of her back legs.

6273
04:46:15,220 --> 04:46:18,800
It's in a vegetative state at the moment.

6274
04:46:19,580 --> 04:46:21,960
You do not kick that puppy.

6275
04:46:25,880 --> 04:46:28,040
You do not do this.

6276
04:46:29,980 --> 04:46:31,240
That is fucked.

6277
04:46:31,560 --> 04:46:32,380
That is fucked.

6278
04:46:36,820 --> 04:46:39,180
Three, two, one.

6279
04:46:39,760 --> 04:46:41,220
Things will be okay.

6280
04:46:45,740 --> 04:46:47,820
Everybody plays like a pro.

6281
04:46:49,880 --> 04:46:51,640
I'm scared.

6282
04:46:54,100 --> 04:46:57,920
This is literally like a pro team on my team.

6283
04:47:10,860 --> 04:47:12,240
Oh my god.

6284
04:47:12,680 --> 04:47:13,300
This is scary.

6285
04:47:27,440 --> 04:47:28,800
I don't.

6286
04:47:29,680 --> 04:47:31,740
He's like, I feel better already.

6287
04:47:31,980 --> 04:47:34,280
I don't think anything can cure what I have.

6288
04:47:34,380 --> 04:47:34,940
It's terminal.

6289
04:47:38,040 --> 04:47:42,560
Unfortunately, the brain rot is terminal.

6290
04:47:43,720 --> 04:47:45,480
Nothing can save me.

6291
04:47:48,440 --> 04:47:49,400
My condolences.

6292
04:47:49,980 --> 04:47:52,380
No intervention can fix what I have.

6293
04:47:52,380 --> 04:47:54,140
Yeah, okay.

6294
04:48:02,400 --> 04:48:03,020
I have to reload.

6295
04:48:03,180 --> 04:48:03,380
I have to reload.

6296
04:48:11,760 --> 04:48:12,920
Does he have soul bar?

6297
04:48:13,100 --> 04:48:13,780
Does he have soul bar?

6298
04:48:18,140 --> 04:48:22,340
I froze strange.

6299
04:48:28,590 --> 04:48:29,530
Restart or not?

6300
04:48:33,390 --> 04:48:34,130
Starlord behind.

6301
04:48:34,250 --> 04:48:34,830
Starlord behind me.

6302
04:48:36,170 --> 04:48:37,010
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

6303
04:48:37,130 --> 04:48:37,690
Starlord one.

6304
04:48:39,490 --> 04:48:40,370
Starlord solo.

6305
04:48:42,210 --> 04:48:43,350
One body left behind you.

6306
04:48:58,300 --> 04:48:59,700
Oh my god.

6307
04:49:01,060 --> 04:49:02,260
I have to use it.

6308
04:49:03,760 --> 04:49:05,420
They're gonna have strange ult here.

6309
04:49:11,090 --> 04:49:12,050
Damage boosting.

6310
04:49:13,490 --> 04:49:14,990
I'm backing out now.

6311
04:49:21,690 --> 04:49:22,590
They still have strange ult.

6312
04:49:30,640 --> 04:49:31,360
Scary.

6313
04:49:35,610 --> 04:49:39,010
I'm a little scared of the strange ult though.

6314
04:49:39,550 --> 04:49:41,190
Just a little scared.

6315
04:49:42,430 --> 04:49:44,710
Just a teeny weeny little bit.

6316
04:49:49,760 --> 04:49:52,040
There it is!

6317
04:49:52,200 --> 04:49:53,040
What the fuck?

6318
04:50:00,470 --> 04:50:02,380
There it goes.

6319
04:50:03,700 --> 04:50:05,260
I don't know how I dodged that.

6320
04:50:07,680 --> 04:50:09,260
How did I dodge that?

6321
04:50:10,600 --> 04:50:11,720
That's crazy.

6322
04:50:15,860 --> 04:50:17,660
I believe.

6323
04:50:18,180 --> 04:50:19,720
Yeah, it's set up in a way.

6324
04:50:32,420 --> 04:50:33,360
Don't kill Luna.

6325
04:50:34,880 --> 04:50:35,420
I've frozen.

6326
04:50:37,720 --> 04:50:39,140
I got the lift.

6327
04:50:46,940 --> 04:50:49,600
4, 3, 2, 1.

6328
04:50:51,620 --> 04:50:53,580
I have a thing on me.

6329
04:50:54,840 --> 04:50:55,620
I might dagged him.

6330
04:50:59,640 --> 04:51:01,080
He's chasing me.

6331
04:51:01,340 --> 04:51:03,020
Thank you.

6332
04:51:05,620 --> 04:51:07,440
He's still chasing me.

6333
04:51:07,580 --> 04:51:07,960
Goodbye.

6334
04:51:10,400 --> 04:51:11,340
I'm on point.

6335
04:51:11,440 --> 04:51:11,760
I'm on point.

6336
04:51:12,880 --> 04:51:15,540
Oh my

6337
04:51:20,080 --> 04:51:20,740
god.

6338
04:51:21,480 --> 04:51:23,600
He's still chasing me.

6339
04:51:23,600 --> 04:51:25,700
They hit a checkpoint.

6340
04:51:25,900 --> 04:51:29,700
Now might be a good time to stop them.

6341
04:51:33,840 --> 04:51:35,940
That's freaking wild.

6342
04:51:41,440 --> 04:51:42,820
Holy shit.

6343
04:51:42,920 --> 04:51:44,100
That's so wild.

6344
04:51:45,420 --> 04:51:47,440
That's freaking wild.

6345
04:51:54,300 --> 04:51:55,860
Just let him.

6346
04:51:56,080 --> 04:51:57,120
I don't have ult here.

6347
04:51:59,440 --> 04:52:01,600
That's fucking wild.

6348
04:52:02,620 --> 04:52:04,220
Holy shit.

6349
04:52:13,600 --> 04:52:16,180
That's a wild thing to say.

6350
04:52:16,280 --> 04:52:17,140
Not gonna lie.

6351
04:52:20,020 --> 04:52:20,860
Goodbye.

6352
04:52:24,520 --> 04:52:26,380
I can save you.

6353
04:52:31,760 --> 04:52:33,880
Oh my god.

6354
04:52:34,340 --> 04:52:34,620
Bro.

6355
04:52:35,040 --> 04:52:36,740
Bro, what's wrong with him?

6356
04:52:37,200 --> 04:52:38,020
Leave me alone.

6357
04:52:39,340 --> 04:52:41,880
Leave me the fuck alone.

6358
04:52:43,960 --> 04:52:44,740
Sylar to your left.

6359
04:52:48,200 --> 04:52:49,580
Sylar behind you guys.

6360
04:52:57,570 --> 04:52:59,570
Oh, he's coming over.

6361
04:53:03,650 --> 04:53:05,310
Leave me alone.

6362
04:53:19,630 --> 04:53:23,130
Oh my god.

6363
04:53:24,430 --> 04:53:26,570
Just leave me alone.

6364
04:53:30,570 --> 04:53:31,310
Please.

6365
04:53:36,070 --> 04:53:37,630
We can go top right.

6366
04:53:38,090 --> 04:53:39,110
I'm TPing.

6367
04:53:39,850 --> 04:53:40,790
We're TPing.

6368
04:53:41,210 --> 04:53:41,570
Yeah.

6369
04:53:46,670 --> 04:53:47,610
Someone touch?

6370
04:53:48,710 --> 04:53:49,490
Put it down bro.

6371
04:53:50,850 --> 04:53:51,570
Oh,

6372
04:53:58,620 --> 04:53:59,000
that's kidding.

6373
04:53:59,240 --> 04:54:00,260
He's a lot old.

6374
04:54:05,230 --> 04:54:07,530
The freakiest of the freak.

6375
04:54:07,530 --> 04:54:10,170
I was like, leave me alone.

6376
04:54:10,330 --> 04:54:15,710
I hear

6377
04:54:30,450 --> 04:54:35,870
someone to my left.

6378
04:54:39,920 --> 04:54:40,280
I've frozen.

6379
04:54:40,360 --> 04:54:40,580
I've frozen.

6380
04:54:40,740 --> 04:54:40,980
He's one.

6381
04:54:49,970 --> 04:54:51,170
I don't know where it is.

6382
04:54:53,590 --> 04:54:54,170
Oh, you ult first?

6383
04:54:54,250 --> 04:54:54,430
Okay.

6384
04:55:02,330 --> 04:55:03,870
I have to ult that now.

6385
04:55:12,720 --> 04:55:14,540
3, 2, 1.

6386
04:55:16,300 --> 04:55:17,260
I froze one of them.

6387
04:55:18,240 --> 04:55:19,000
The supports are...

6388
04:55:26,070 --> 04:55:27,190
Last fight.

6389
04:55:30,290 --> 04:55:31,690
I have to reload.

6390
04:55:37,150 --> 04:55:38,610
He has ult, I'm pretty sure.

6391
04:55:42,470 --> 04:55:44,550
I don't have to be center stage.

6392
04:56:07,380 --> 04:56:08,820
I've frozen.

6393
04:56:08,980 --> 04:56:09,280
I've frozen.

6394
04:56:14,080 --> 04:56:14,800
Guys,

6395
04:56:19,870 --> 04:56:20,650
it's not me.

6396
04:56:21,930 --> 04:56:23,670
It's not just me.

6397
04:56:23,670 --> 04:56:25,290
3, 2, 1.

6398
04:56:26,270 --> 04:56:28,990
Oh, it's not me guys.

6399
04:56:32,310 --> 04:56:34,130
Oh my god.

6400
04:56:35,350 --> 04:56:36,870
Not the problem.

6401
04:56:38,170 --> 04:56:40,510
Not the problem chat.

6402
04:56:43,330 --> 04:56:45,490
Oh my god.

6403
04:56:46,530 --> 04:56:47,790
That's all I needed.

6404
04:56:48,250 --> 04:56:50,150
It's not being the problem.

6405
04:56:50,710 --> 04:56:51,690
That's all.

6406
04:56:53,970 --> 04:56:56,980
Doki plus EU equals win.

6407
04:56:59,750 --> 04:57:01,850
I'm not the problem.

6408
04:57:02,210 --> 04:57:03,450
Thank god.

6409
04:57:03,570 --> 04:57:04,930
We figured it out.

6410
04:57:06,330 --> 04:57:08,530
Eco has been saved.

6411
04:57:08,730 --> 04:57:09,370
I'll be right back.

6412
04:57:58,900 --> 04:57:59,880
It's great.

6413
04:58:00,100 --> 04:58:02,420
I get a thousand dollars and I don't have to feel like shit.

6414
04:58:07,450 --> 04:58:08,440
Oh my god.

6415
04:58:09,000 --> 04:58:10,260
I feel great.

6416
04:58:13,450 --> 04:58:19,730
I got my participation award and at least I know I'm not the problem.

6417
04:58:21,250 --> 04:58:23,670
Rank therapy success.

6418
04:58:24,270 --> 04:58:24,710
Yay.

6419
04:58:26,570 --> 04:58:28,450
Oh my god.

6420
04:58:28,570 --> 04:58:31,170
I won two games in a row.

6421
04:58:31,930 --> 04:58:32,570
Oh my.

6422
04:58:32,650 --> 04:58:33,550
It's my birthday.

6423
04:58:34,430 --> 04:58:36,330
It's actually my birthday.

6424
04:58:41,010 --> 04:58:41,810
Yippee.

6425
04:58:42,610 --> 04:58:43,090
Woo.

6426
04:58:44,950 --> 04:58:47,350
Happy birthday to me.

6427
04:58:47,850 --> 04:58:49,950
How the fuck do I have fate on my team?

6428
04:58:51,750 --> 04:58:54,670
I'm like, how do I have these people in my friends list?

6429
04:58:54,730 --> 04:58:55,690
I don't even remember.

6430
04:58:56,390 --> 04:58:58,810
I don't even remember how I had fate in here.

6431
04:59:00,690 --> 04:59:02,870
I had the LG people guys.

6432
04:59:03,350 --> 04:59:03,770
Whoa.

6433
04:59:05,530 --> 04:59:05,870
Wait.

6434
04:59:06,030 --> 04:59:06,290
Okay.

6435
04:59:06,430 --> 04:59:07,170
I need to know.

6436
04:59:07,270 --> 04:59:07,410
Okay.

6437
04:59:07,490 --> 04:59:07,670
Yeah.

6438
04:59:07,710 --> 04:59:07,930
See.

6439
04:59:08,170 --> 04:59:08,690
I had the LG.

6440
04:59:08,750 --> 04:59:09,150
Oh hey.

6441
04:59:09,350 --> 04:59:09,550
Hey.

6442
04:59:09,870 --> 04:59:10,330
Dad.

6443
04:59:11,010 --> 04:59:11,550
Hey.

6444
04:59:11,710 --> 04:59:12,430
Did you know?

6445
04:59:12,610 --> 04:59:13,590
I'm not the problem.

6446
04:59:13,990 --> 04:59:14,510
Yeah.

6447
04:59:15,690 --> 04:59:16,130
Yeah.

6448
04:59:16,210 --> 04:59:18,330
I'm not the problem little guy.

6449
04:59:19,330 --> 04:59:20,410
I'm climbing.

6450
04:59:21,070 --> 04:59:22,270
Well no, I'm down again.

6451
04:59:22,610 --> 04:59:23,630
But like, hey.

6452
04:59:27,210 --> 04:59:28,630
Oh my god.

6453
04:59:28,930 --> 04:59:33,350
No, I know we do not message the team to let them know that guys.

6454
04:59:33,730 --> 04:59:35,230
No, that's a little fucked up.

6455
04:59:35,470 --> 04:59:36,630
You know what was fucked up?

6456
04:59:36,730 --> 04:59:38,390
Telling Andrew I was 0-10.

6457
04:59:38,390 --> 04:59:40,390
That was fucked up.

6458
04:59:43,170 --> 04:59:46,890
You know, you could've been like, yeah, she went 0-7.

6459
04:59:47,210 --> 04:59:52,250
But you had to include my rank score along the way.

6460
04:59:54,590 --> 04:59:56,570
Now it's 2-10.

6461
04:59:56,810 --> 04:59:57,130
Okay?

6462
04:59:57,650 --> 04:59:59,170
I'm 2-10 now.

6463
05:00:03,070 --> 05:00:05,570
That was the fucked up part.

6464
05:00:05,650 --> 05:00:07,730
You kicked a disabled puppy.

6465
05:00:08,390 --> 05:00:10,510
I was having a seizure on the ground.

6466
05:00:10,770 --> 05:00:17,570
And you slid over to Andrew's chat and was like, hey, you wanna cut this puppy's legs off too?

6467
05:00:17,910 --> 05:00:18,670
Might as well.

6468
05:00:18,730 --> 05:00:20,530
She's defenseless and fragile.

6469
05:00:21,230 --> 05:00:22,590
You might as well.

6470
05:00:26,030 --> 05:00:27,770
That's fucked up.

6471
05:00:29,890 --> 05:00:32,610
How is this like I taught you?

6472
05:00:38,390 --> 05:00:39,310
Oh my God.

6473
05:00:39,610 --> 05:00:41,650
You're like, cut this puppy's legs off.

6474
05:00:41,710 --> 05:00:42,890
She's not using it.

6475
05:00:43,090 --> 05:00:44,130
I was.

6476
05:00:44,270 --> 05:00:45,870
I was using it.

6477
05:00:47,550 --> 05:00:48,030
Alright.

6478
05:00:49,190 --> 05:00:50,290
Alright, anyway.

6479
05:00:50,890 --> 05:00:51,330
Anyway.

6480
05:00:51,730 --> 05:00:55,690
So, uh, Doki will kick the dragon once in that situation.

6481
05:00:56,990 --> 05:00:58,950
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

6482
05:00:59,070 --> 05:00:59,730
Thank you, thank you.

6483
05:00:59,910 --> 05:01:01,830
Anyway, back to the blessed guy.

6484
05:01:02,130 --> 05:01:03,090
So like, alright.

6485
05:01:03,430 --> 05:01:05,850
So when they were calling out blessed as a hacker.

6486
05:01:06,070 --> 05:01:06,810
Alright, let me show you.

6487
05:01:06,810 --> 05:01:09,310
Okay, I know there's like several accounts.

6488
05:01:09,530 --> 05:01:12,390
So blessed is also, um.

6489
05:01:13,050 --> 05:01:13,770
So this is blessed.

6490
05:01:14,970 --> 05:01:17,850
And blessed has like two other accounts in top 500.

6491
05:01:18,070 --> 05:01:20,130
Unless they dropped out.

6492
05:01:20,570 --> 05:01:22,990
They have blessed and two other.

6493
05:01:23,190 --> 05:01:24,890
They all have the same names.

6494
05:01:24,990 --> 05:01:30,310
It's basically all of them is like the tiny ass shit that they do.

6495
05:01:30,590 --> 05:01:31,930
So it's all like this.

6496
05:01:32,210 --> 05:01:35,230
So like they're calling, the EU people were calling blessed as a hacker.

6497
05:01:35,230 --> 05:01:37,510
But I know who blessed queues with.

6498
05:01:37,630 --> 05:01:41,350
So I am, I know exactly who blessed queues with.

6499
05:01:41,590 --> 05:01:45,530
So it's very interesting that they're calling him out as a hacker.

6500
05:01:46,030 --> 05:01:48,030
Because like, um.

6501
05:01:48,130 --> 05:01:50,230
He, I know exactly who he plays with.

6502
05:01:50,350 --> 05:01:51,530
And I'm like, hmm.

6503
05:01:52,790 --> 05:01:53,630
You know?

6504
05:01:53,930 --> 05:01:55,490
You're like, hmm, I see.

6505
05:01:56,310 --> 05:01:56,490
Alright.

6506
05:01:59,090 --> 05:02:00,270
I think they dropped out.

6507
05:02:00,350 --> 05:02:01,390
I know only myself.

6508
05:02:01,890 --> 05:02:04,970
I don't think I have them on the recent players list anymore.

6509
05:02:04,970 --> 05:02:07,930
So they might have just dropped out recently.

6510
05:02:10,130 --> 05:02:10,610
Um.

6511
05:02:10,850 --> 05:02:12,570
So that's interesting.

6512
05:02:13,190 --> 05:02:13,670
Uh.

6513
05:02:14,770 --> 05:02:16,770
But they all have, they all basically.

6514
05:02:16,890 --> 05:02:17,570
Oh, hey, I'm back.

6515
05:02:18,430 --> 05:02:18,910
Look at that.

6516
05:02:19,170 --> 05:02:20,050
Look at that, guys.

6517
05:02:20,830 --> 05:02:21,810
Guys, don't look at that.

6518
05:02:24,210 --> 05:02:24,690
Yay!

6519
05:02:28,990 --> 05:02:30,050
Guys, no.

6520
05:02:30,310 --> 05:02:31,330
Guys, I swear to God.

6521
05:02:31,410 --> 05:02:31,650
Okay.

6522
05:02:31,890 --> 05:02:33,250
This might look bad.

6523
05:02:33,250 --> 05:02:35,190
But if I put it like this.

6524
05:02:35,430 --> 05:02:37,090
It looks a little better.

6525
05:02:39,310 --> 05:02:42,190
If I, if I put it like this.

6526
05:02:42,410 --> 05:02:44,910
It looks a little better, guys.

6527
05:02:49,720 --> 05:02:51,160
Like, don't judge me.

6528
05:02:51,220 --> 05:02:53,080
But I can't win everyday.

6529
05:02:53,420 --> 05:02:53,720
Okay.

6530
05:02:54,020 --> 05:02:56,260
I cannot win everyday, guys.

6531
05:02:57,200 --> 05:02:57,800
Sadly.

6532
05:02:58,380 --> 05:02:59,920
It's just like that.

6533
05:03:00,380 --> 05:03:01,180
I just can't.

6534
05:03:02,300 --> 05:03:04,080
I just can't, guys.

6535
05:03:05,560 --> 05:03:08,220
It is impossible to win everyday.

6536
05:03:12,380 --> 05:03:15,080
Oh, is it?

6537
05:03:15,160 --> 05:03:15,640
Yeah, guys.

6538
05:03:15,700 --> 05:03:17,940
I was just in colorblind mode, guys.

6539
05:03:18,140 --> 05:03:18,820
It was just.

6540
05:03:19,060 --> 05:03:19,620
It was.

6541
05:03:19,800 --> 05:03:20,880
I swear to God.

6542
05:03:20,960 --> 05:03:22,640
It was just colorblind mode.

6543
05:03:22,880 --> 05:03:23,740
Do I even have?

6544
05:03:23,860 --> 05:03:25,160
What's my proficiency on there?

6545
05:03:26,240 --> 05:03:26,680
Uh.

6546
05:03:26,880 --> 05:03:27,240
Night.

6547
05:03:27,360 --> 05:03:28,580
I wanna have Adam Lord.

6548
05:03:28,860 --> 05:03:30,780
But like, I'm definitely not close to it.

6549
05:03:31,540 --> 05:03:32,140
I am.

6550
05:03:32,280 --> 05:03:32,500
Yeah.

6551
05:03:32,580 --> 05:03:33,620
I am not close to it.

6552
05:03:33,620 --> 05:03:34,480
I need like.

6553
05:03:35,280 --> 05:03:35,720
Uh.

6554
05:03:36,020 --> 05:03:37,560
I'm just trying to get it naturally.

6555
05:03:39,240 --> 05:03:40,440
Guys, it's okay.

6556
05:03:40,720 --> 05:03:41,740
It's okay, guys.

6557
05:03:42,160 --> 05:03:44,460
We might not be the best player.

6558
05:03:44,720 --> 05:03:46,800
But like, we're doing our best, guys.

6559
05:03:47,320 --> 05:03:47,620
We are.

6560
05:03:49,420 --> 05:03:50,540
We are.

6561
05:03:50,600 --> 05:03:51,340
We are.

6562
05:03:51,600 --> 05:03:52,900
We are doing our best.

6563
05:03:52,980 --> 05:03:55,280
Oh, they're doing something in the practice range.

6564
05:03:55,700 --> 05:03:57,380
When is their tournament anyway?

6565
05:03:58,160 --> 05:03:59,260
When is Sentinels?

6566
05:03:59,380 --> 05:04:01,660
Alright, let me check the Sentinels fight night shit.

6567
05:04:02,080 --> 05:04:02,720
Where are they at?

6568
05:04:04,560 --> 05:04:05,520
They are.

6569
05:04:05,960 --> 05:04:07,660
Oh, there's one game left.

6570
05:04:08,140 --> 05:04:08,900
It's best to.

6571
05:04:10,200 --> 05:04:11,780
Oh, there's one game left.

6572
05:04:12,020 --> 05:04:13,880
So like, if we manage.

6573
05:04:14,080 --> 05:04:14,500
We just need.

6574
05:04:14,880 --> 05:04:16,820
So, this is Gomez's last game.

6575
05:04:17,120 --> 05:04:17,540
Basically.

6576
05:04:17,820 --> 05:04:18,320
Cause there's two.

6577
05:04:19,460 --> 05:04:21,980
One of these just needs to win one more game.

6578
05:04:22,120 --> 05:04:23,820
And then they fight.

6579
05:04:24,340 --> 05:04:24,820
Um.

6580
05:04:24,880 --> 05:04:27,100
And then they fight Sentinels.

6581
05:04:27,320 --> 05:04:28,720
So this is like his last game.

6582
05:04:28,860 --> 05:04:30,160
Oh, please get me a game.

6583
05:04:30,620 --> 05:04:32,100
Please get me a game.

6584
05:04:32,920 --> 05:04:33,880
Come on.

6585
05:04:34,020 --> 05:04:35,120
Get me a game.

6586
05:04:35,220 --> 05:04:37,000
At least make it so that I'm back.

6587
05:04:37,120 --> 05:04:37,760
I'm like.

6588
05:04:37,800 --> 05:04:39,260
Back to where I was.

6589
05:04:43,940 --> 05:04:45,560
This is last game.

6590
05:04:47,780 --> 05:04:48,260
Alright.

6591
05:04:48,440 --> 05:04:49,980
And then we're back to like.

05:04:49,980 --> 05:04:51,140
We're back to like.

6593
05:04:51,240 --> 05:04:51,960
Elo hell.

6594
05:04:52,280 --> 05:04:52,760
I guess.

6595
05:04:56,460 --> 05:04:57,540
This is not our.

6596
05:04:57,660 --> 05:04:57,960
Guys.

6597
05:04:58,040 --> 05:05:00,100
This is not our last game though.

6598
05:05:02,200 --> 05:05:02,840
Guys.

6599
05:05:03,040 --> 05:05:04,840
It's not our last game though.

6600
05:05:05,060 --> 05:05:05,440
Chat.

6601
05:05:06,000 --> 05:05:06,180
We.

6602
05:05:06,920 --> 05:05:08,900
We're still here to suffer.

6603
05:05:11,280 --> 05:05:14,780
Is Desi the one queuing with Andrew right now?

6604
05:05:14,940 --> 05:05:15,680
Can't tell.

6605
05:05:16,320 --> 05:05:16,720
Yeah.

6606
05:05:16,900 --> 05:05:17,040
Yeah.

6607
05:05:17,080 --> 05:05:18,240
He's playing with Andrew.

6608
05:05:18,680 --> 05:05:19,260
What if I like.

6609
05:05:19,400 --> 05:05:20,600
Mooch into their team.

6610
05:05:22,180 --> 05:05:24,580
Do you need a fourth person?

6611
05:05:28,620 --> 05:05:29,260
Hey.

6612
05:05:29,480 --> 05:05:30,080
Doki Bridge.

6613
05:05:30,080 --> 05:05:30,780
Oh hey.

6614
05:05:30,940 --> 05:05:31,600
It's Helis.

6615
05:05:32,640 --> 05:05:33,960
What's Helis doing here?

6616
05:05:34,720 --> 05:05:35,160
Oh he's.

6617
05:05:35,340 --> 05:05:36,760
He hid in his profile.

6618
05:05:37,300 --> 05:05:38,860
I can't.

6619
05:05:38,900 --> 05:05:41,120
It's not Korean hours yet.

6620
05:05:42,080 --> 05:05:46,440
I can't fucking message the Koreans to play with me.

6621
05:05:46,560 --> 05:05:46,760
Wait.

6622
05:05:46,900 --> 05:05:48,760
Did Choppa add me?

6623
05:05:49,500 --> 05:05:50,740
Choppa didn't.

6624
05:05:51,180 --> 05:05:52,800
Didn't look at his friend.

6625
05:05:52,980 --> 05:05:53,160
No.

6626
05:05:55,140 --> 05:05:55,780
No.

6627
05:05:55,780 --> 05:05:56,220
No.

6628
05:05:57,940 --> 05:06:01,020
Choppa didn't add me back.

6629
05:06:01,100 --> 05:06:03,180
He didn't accept my friend request.

6630
05:06:03,540 --> 05:06:05,100
He was the funny one.

6631
05:06:05,420 --> 05:06:06,460
He was the funniest.

6632
05:06:10,100 --> 05:06:12,100
Who are we playing against?

6633
05:06:12,260 --> 05:06:12,780
Or with?

6634
05:06:13,720 --> 05:06:14,180
Damn.

6635
05:06:14,280 --> 05:06:15,180
That 128.

6636
05:06:16,340 --> 05:06:17,200
Goes hard.

6637
05:06:19,320 --> 05:06:20,130
I don't know if that's.

6638
05:06:20,840 --> 05:06:22,140
That is.

6639
05:06:23,440 --> 05:06:24,320
The magic player.

6640
05:06:25,900 --> 05:06:27,940
That 128 goes so hard.

6641
05:06:30,420 --> 05:06:30,940
Alright.

6642
05:06:31,180 --> 05:06:31,780
Let's see.

6643
05:06:31,880 --> 05:06:32,760
Who do we have?

6644
05:06:33,260 --> 05:06:33,400
We.

6645
05:06:33,500 --> 05:06:34,240
I don't know who.

6646
05:06:34,440 --> 05:06:34,640
Oh.

6647
05:06:34,740 --> 05:06:35,700
I don't like this guy.

6648
05:06:36,280 --> 05:06:36,720
He like.

6649
05:06:36,800 --> 05:06:38,460
He like shit talk to me.

6650
05:06:39,220 --> 05:06:39,960
So I'm like.

6651
05:06:40,460 --> 05:06:41,740
I'm muting him.

6652
05:06:42,080 --> 05:06:44,000
He called me a bad support player.

6653
05:06:44,160 --> 05:06:44,700
And that.

6654
05:06:45,100 --> 05:06:47,020
That hurt my feelings.

6655
05:06:51,240 --> 05:06:55,740
I don't want him to call me a bad support player in front of my stream.

6656
05:06:55,900 --> 05:06:57,500
I'm already going through a lot.

6657
05:06:57,680 --> 05:06:58,120
Guys.

6658
05:07:01,880 --> 05:07:02,420
Guys.

6659
05:07:02,780 --> 05:07:04,640
I'm going through a lot already.

6660
05:07:04,860 --> 05:07:08,160
I don't need him to call me bad right now.

6661
05:07:08,420 --> 05:07:14,720
I guess I can't.

6662
05:07:17,300 --> 05:07:17,820
Guys.

6663
05:07:17,980 --> 05:07:18,440
I'm like.

6664
05:07:18,680 --> 05:07:20,520
I can't move my legs.

6665
05:07:21,400 --> 05:07:21,920
Guys.

6666
05:07:22,700 --> 05:07:24,640
I'm just a little puppy.

6667
05:07:25,040 --> 05:07:25,260
Guys.

6668
05:07:25,380 --> 05:07:27,040
I can't let this happen.

6669
05:07:31,140 --> 05:07:31,660
Alright.

6670
05:07:32,000 --> 05:07:32,500
Wait.

6671
05:07:32,520 --> 05:07:34,180
Which one is the number 8?

6672
05:07:35,340 --> 05:07:35,660
Alright.

6673
05:07:35,760 --> 05:07:36,400
Here we go.

6674
05:07:36,680 --> 05:07:36,920
Guys.

6675
05:07:36,960 --> 05:07:37,740
You don't understand.

6676
05:07:38,000 --> 05:07:40,120
I'm not like okay at the moment.

6677
05:07:40,320 --> 05:07:40,580
I'm.

6678
05:07:44,980 --> 05:07:47,140
If it was any other day.

6679
05:07:47,260 --> 05:07:48,360
Where I was not.

6680
05:07:48,520 --> 05:07:50,540
Where I'm not 210 right now.

6681
05:07:50,920 --> 05:07:52,460
It would've been fine.

6682
05:07:52,580 --> 05:07:54,020
But if he calls me bad.

6683
05:07:54,300 --> 05:07:55,560
I'm gonna cry.

6684
05:07:59,440 --> 05:08:00,060
Okay.

6685
05:08:00,720 --> 05:08:01,500
I won't cry.

6686
05:08:01,700 --> 05:08:03,760
I'll be very very sad.

6687
05:08:06,280 --> 05:08:09,420
If I wasn't 210 right now.

6688
05:08:09,800 --> 05:08:12,890
I would've been okay if he calls me bad.

6689
05:08:13,420 --> 05:08:14,660
But I am.

6690
05:08:14,720 --> 05:08:16,080
210 right now.

6691
05:08:18,040 --> 05:08:20,740
Mental health has left the chat.

6692
05:08:20,960 --> 05:08:21,340
Guys.

6693
05:08:21,400 --> 05:08:21,600
Guys.

6694
05:08:21,640 --> 05:08:23,480
Can you gas me up a little bit before he.

6695
05:08:24,480 --> 05:08:28,160
Can you guys gas me up before he destroys all my.

6696
05:08:32,220 --> 05:08:33,260
Oh shit.

6697
05:08:34,780 --> 05:08:35,200
Okay.

6698
05:08:35,860 --> 05:08:36,600
We should've queued up.

6699
05:08:36,700 --> 05:08:36,880
Whoops.

6700
05:08:38,300 --> 05:08:38,820
Sorry.

6701
05:08:41,380 --> 05:08:41,900
Whoopsie.

6702
05:08:43,140 --> 05:08:44,500
I cannot understand you.

6703
05:08:44,600 --> 05:08:45,520
What's wrong with your mic?

6704
05:08:45,600 --> 05:08:46,540
You're like talking on the water.

6705
05:08:48,920 --> 05:08:49,300
Alright.

6706
05:08:51,920 --> 05:08:52,760
Wait what?

6707
05:08:53,060 --> 05:08:53,640
Why are we.

6708
05:08:53,900 --> 05:08:54,420
Woah!

6709
05:08:54,740 --> 05:08:55,260
Woah!

6710
05:08:55,920 --> 05:08:56,980
That lag spike.

6711
05:08:58,060 --> 05:09:00,120
Was fucking rough for me.

6712
05:09:03,920 --> 05:09:04,380
Azla.

6713
05:09:05,660 --> 05:09:07,580
Don't call me bad please.

6714
05:09:08,260 --> 05:09:08,580
Wait I.

6715
05:09:08,720 --> 05:09:09,760
You can't call me bad.

6716
05:09:10,440 --> 05:09:11,000
Alright I'm gonna go in.

6717
05:09:11,000 --> 05:09:11,680
I'm gonna go in bubble.

6718
05:09:12,460 --> 05:09:12,860
Yup.

6719
05:09:13,280 --> 05:09:14,160
3, 3, 3, 3.

6720
05:09:14,240 --> 05:09:14,560
No, no, no.

6721
05:09:14,820 --> 05:09:15,240
Oh okay.

6722
05:09:15,320 --> 05:09:15,700
Nevermind.

6723
05:09:16,760 --> 05:09:17,760
I have it now though.

6724
05:09:18,300 --> 05:09:20,000
You can't call me bad if he's muted.

6725
05:09:20,720 --> 05:09:21,720
You're right guys.

6726
05:09:22,140 --> 05:09:22,780
Alright let's do this.

6727
05:09:23,040 --> 05:09:23,280
Ready?

6728
05:09:24,000 --> 05:09:24,480
I don't know.

6729
05:09:26,080 --> 05:09:26,700
Loki 1.

6730
05:09:27,200 --> 05:09:27,620
Ela 1.

6731
05:09:27,720 --> 05:09:28,380
Can I get a point?

6732
05:09:28,480 --> 05:09:29,120
Can I get a point?

6733
05:09:30,340 --> 05:09:31,100
It's fine.

6734
05:09:31,860 --> 05:09:33,100
We just don't talk.

6735
05:09:37,350 --> 05:09:38,510
I'm going up top again.

6736
05:09:39,910 --> 05:09:40,910
This is okay.

6737
05:09:41,970 --> 05:09:42,910
It's okay.

6738
05:09:44,660 --> 05:09:45,830
We're so healthy.

6739
05:09:47,150 --> 05:09:48,590
We did it guys.

6740
05:09:54,610 --> 05:09:56,190
Things will be okay.

6741
05:09:57,510 --> 05:09:58,370
Look at that.

6742
05:09:58,490 --> 05:09:59,470
I can hit shots.

6743
05:10:00,110 --> 05:10:01,810
Things will be so healthy.

6744
05:10:03,590 --> 05:10:04,970
I should not break that.

6745
05:10:05,190 --> 05:10:05,630
But like.

6746
05:10:05,730 --> 05:10:06,830
I'll just do it just cause.

6747
05:10:07,710 --> 05:10:08,150
Uhh.

6748
05:10:11,170 --> 05:10:11,790
I'm ready.

6749
05:10:12,470 --> 05:10:13,130
Come on Malte.

6750
05:10:13,230 --> 05:10:13,710
Oh okay.

6751
05:10:13,710 --> 05:10:14,190
Nevermind.

6752
05:10:14,630 --> 05:10:16,010
Mantis heal first.

6753
05:10:21,020 --> 05:10:22,480
Oh my god.

6754
05:10:26,300 --> 05:10:27,100
It's okay.

6755
05:10:28,240 --> 05:10:29,080
I have yet.

6756
05:10:30,340 --> 05:10:31,820
Oh my god.

6757
05:10:31,860 --> 05:10:33,040
He does not see me.

6758
05:10:33,120 --> 05:10:34,020
And that's okay.

6759
05:10:38,450 --> 05:10:39,470
That's okay.

6760
05:10:39,550 --> 05:10:40,570
He doesn't see me.

6761
05:10:42,270 --> 05:10:44,030
Oh my god.

6762
05:10:46,390 --> 05:10:47,370
Play it.

6763
05:10:48,850 --> 05:10:49,190
Okay.

6764
05:10:55,230 --> 05:10:55,850
Where?

6765
05:10:56,290 --> 05:10:57,210
Where is he?

6766
05:10:57,490 --> 05:10:57,670
Wait.

6767
05:10:57,710 --> 05:10:58,110
Think behind.

6768
05:10:58,230 --> 05:10:58,590
Think behind.

6769
05:11:01,370 --> 05:11:03,950
Please don't let him beat me up.

6770
05:11:09,190 --> 05:11:09,810
Okay.

6771
05:11:13,520 --> 05:11:14,300
Oh shit.

6772
05:11:15,820 --> 05:11:16,220
Come on man.

6773
05:11:16,280 --> 05:11:16,600
Come on.

6774
05:11:20,220 --> 05:11:20,240
Please.

6775
05:11:20,960 --> 05:11:21,600
Please.

6776
05:11:21,720 --> 05:11:21,920
Where?

6777
05:11:22,100 --> 05:11:23,020
Where is he?

6778
05:11:23,420 --> 05:11:24,340
Where is he?

6779
05:11:24,420 --> 05:11:25,420
I can't tell.

6780
05:11:25,820 --> 05:11:26,120
Where?

6781
05:11:36,920 --> 05:11:39,260
I didn't know where to look at.

6782
05:11:39,360 --> 05:11:42,460
It was very confusing guys.

6783
05:11:43,040 --> 05:11:43,560
It was.

6784
05:11:46,620 --> 05:11:48,260
That was a little weird.

6785
05:11:52,780 --> 05:11:53,360
Alright.

6786
05:11:54,300 --> 05:11:56,000
I need to hit something.

6787
05:11:57,060 --> 05:11:58,400
Oh, don't look at me.

6788
05:12:00,720 --> 05:12:02,300
Oh, that was such a good shield.

6789
05:12:03,160 --> 05:12:03,900
I'm 98!

6790
05:12:05,140 --> 05:12:05,580
Okay.

6791
05:12:07,160 --> 05:12:08,060
Oh, I got it.

6792
05:12:09,580 --> 05:12:10,020
Hello.

6793
05:12:11,820 --> 05:12:12,200
Hello.

6794
05:12:20,770 --> 05:12:21,930
Oh my god.

6795
05:12:24,670 --> 05:12:26,010
No, not the born again.

6796
05:12:26,090 --> 05:12:26,950
Not the born again.

6797
05:12:27,130 --> 05:12:27,350
No.

6798
05:12:29,710 --> 05:12:30,730
Where is the born again?

6799
05:12:30,730 --> 05:12:31,950
I can't tell.

6800
05:12:34,810 --> 05:12:36,430
Oh shit, that's huge.

6801
05:12:40,110 --> 05:12:41,810
Yeah, fuck this clone in particular.

6802
05:12:47,010 --> 05:12:49,150
Yeah, fuck that one clone.

6803
05:12:51,590 --> 05:12:52,250
Alright.

6804
05:12:53,090 --> 05:12:55,550
I am not like the best.

6805
05:12:56,570 --> 05:12:56,850
Goodbye.

6806
05:13:02,510 --> 05:13:03,170
Okay.

6807
05:13:03,550 --> 05:13:04,460
Things are...

6808
05:13:05,070 --> 05:13:07,670
Things are feeling a little better right now.

6809
05:13:10,000 --> 05:13:12,950
You know, I think I'm sensing a pattern here.

6810
05:13:13,370 --> 05:13:16,450
As long as I have a European on my team...

6811
05:13:16,450 --> 05:13:19,550
Like, things are looking up for Doki.

6812
05:13:22,950 --> 05:13:25,890
I just need Europeans on my team.

6813
05:13:29,470 --> 05:13:30,590
I think that's...

6814
05:13:30,590 --> 05:13:31,590
I think that's the key.

6815
05:13:31,590 --> 05:13:33,970
I think that's actually the key, guys.

6816
05:13:38,530 --> 05:13:39,570
Oh man.

6817
05:13:39,910 --> 05:13:41,410
I wish the Koreans were awake.

6818
05:13:41,670 --> 05:13:43,670
I wish they were awake.

6819
05:13:43,870 --> 05:13:45,610
I miss the Korean players.

6820
05:13:48,770 --> 05:13:51,930
I promise Choppa I'll make him viral.

6821
05:13:52,670 --> 05:13:56,130
He was like, promise me you'll make me go viral.

6822
05:13:56,310 --> 05:13:57,450
And I was like, I promise.

6823
05:13:58,150 --> 05:14:00,390
He was like, promise me you'll make me go viral.

6824
05:14:01,750 --> 05:14:02,790
Donkey Kong.

6825
05:14:02,890 --> 05:14:06,290
And I was like, I promise I'll make you famous, Choppa.

6826
05:14:14,150 --> 05:14:16,490
Are we doing the TP shit?

6827
05:14:20,790 --> 05:14:22,870
Alright, here we go.

6828
05:14:24,750 --> 05:14:26,910
No, it's cause he didn't see it, guys.

6829
05:14:27,170 --> 05:14:28,450
He just didn't see it.

6830
05:14:28,530 --> 05:14:29,510
No, don't say that.

6831
05:14:29,510 --> 05:14:31,210
He didn't see it.

6832
05:14:31,430 --> 05:14:33,310
Funfuntitobi added me.

6833
05:14:33,390 --> 05:14:34,610
I'm lovable.

6834
05:14:35,290 --> 05:14:38,450
I'm just a little quirky little guy.

6835
05:14:38,690 --> 05:14:40,550
I'm so lovable.

6836
05:14:45,190 --> 05:14:46,970
There's no way.

6837
05:14:48,210 --> 05:14:49,410
Guys, he didn't see that.

6838
05:14:51,410 --> 05:14:53,870
I'm so quirky and lovable.

6839
05:14:55,030 --> 05:14:57,030
I refuse to believe.

6840
05:15:03,150 --> 05:15:04,530
There's no way.

6841
05:15:08,030 --> 05:15:09,170
There's a...

6842
05:15:09,170 --> 05:15:09,370
No!

6843
05:15:14,560 --> 05:15:16,340
Okay, I sort of threw that.

6844
05:15:16,780 --> 05:15:18,060
I sort of threw that.

6845
05:15:19,200 --> 05:15:28,620
I wanted to drop down and heal from behind, but then I didn't realize there was a fucking Starlord in our little backline there.

6846
05:15:30,380 --> 05:15:31,260
Not fair.

6847
05:15:35,100 --> 05:15:36,700
It's not fair.

6848
05:15:49,620 --> 05:15:51,980
There's a guy right over here that rezzed.

6849
05:15:57,980 --> 05:15:58,380
Please,

6850
05:16:07,350 --> 05:16:08,050
keep me up, keep me up.

6851
05:16:10,590 --> 05:16:10,990
I got it.

6852
05:16:12,310 --> 05:16:13,730
I'm pushing, I'm pushing for it.

6853
05:16:15,150 --> 05:16:16,430
No!

6854
05:16:19,250 --> 05:16:20,530
No!

6855
05:16:22,050 --> 05:16:22,810
No!

6856
05:16:25,980 --> 05:16:28,680
Oh, everybody died too fast.

6857
05:16:31,200 --> 05:16:34,880
Everybody died too fucking fast.

6858
05:16:37,880 --> 05:16:40,020
They feared me.

6859
05:16:40,640 --> 05:16:41,060
Why?

6860
05:16:41,540 --> 05:16:43,340
I'm just a little guy.

6861
05:16:44,460 --> 05:16:48,000
If they knew my record, would they truly fear me though?

6862
05:16:50,960 --> 05:16:53,640
If they knew what I've been going through.

6863
05:16:57,320 --> 05:16:58,920
They just don't know.

6864
05:16:59,120 --> 05:17:00,520
They should not fear me.

6865
05:17:01,160 --> 05:17:02,400
I'm just...

6866
05:17:02,400 --> 05:17:04,500
I'm just a little guy.

6867
05:17:07,820 --> 05:17:10,600
Oh my god, I hit the shots that matter.

6868
05:17:13,380 --> 05:17:14,640
Alright, get out, get out.

6869
05:17:14,800 --> 05:17:15,280
Let me get out.

6870
05:17:15,920 --> 05:17:16,820
He fucking lied to me.

6871
05:17:17,480 --> 05:17:18,700
I didn't want it to be...

6872
05:17:18,700 --> 05:17:19,620
Nah, they've had him though.

6873
05:17:19,700 --> 05:17:20,700
Press one button, foolish me.

6874
05:17:22,620 --> 05:17:23,100
That's true.

6875
05:17:27,560 --> 05:17:28,240
Starlord's trying to ult.

6876
05:17:32,100 --> 05:17:33,080
We're doing it.

6877
05:17:34,720 --> 05:17:36,960
Oh, I'm... Oh, we're okay, we're okay.

6878
05:17:38,940 --> 05:17:39,560
I don't know.

6879
05:17:42,040 --> 05:17:42,760
Strange has ult.

6880
05:17:45,840 --> 05:17:47,600
No, I couldn't get my right click.

6881
05:17:47,660 --> 05:17:49,840
I couldn't get my fucking right click.

6882
05:17:49,980 --> 05:17:51,200
I got it now.

6883
05:17:51,420 --> 05:17:53,560
Oh, this is a very scary rez.

6884
05:17:53,980 --> 05:17:56,700
This truly is very scary right now.

6885
05:17:58,000 --> 05:17:59,620
Oh my god.

6886
05:18:02,760 --> 05:18:03,380
I'm ulting this.

6887
05:18:04,780 --> 05:18:05,100
Okay.

6888
05:18:07,540 --> 05:18:08,000
This is huge.

6889
05:18:13,600 --> 05:18:15,000
Oh my god.

6890
05:18:15,360 --> 05:18:16,740
We did it.

6891
05:18:16,740 --> 05:18:18,740
We lived.

6892
05:18:19,980 --> 05:18:21,100
That was so scary.

6893
05:18:22,780 --> 05:18:23,980
That was actually so scary.

6894
05:18:24,720 --> 05:18:25,580
Holy fuck.

6895
05:18:27,620 --> 05:18:28,940
We should not have lived that.

6896
05:18:31,300 --> 05:18:34,200
We absolutely should not have lived that, guys.

6897
05:18:38,030 --> 05:18:39,370
I don't know how.

6898
05:18:40,130 --> 05:18:41,730
But like, I take those.

6899
05:18:42,690 --> 05:18:45,110
We still have to do two more minutes of this.

6900
05:18:46,030 --> 05:18:49,110
Or four minutes, depending on how fucked up...

6901
05:18:52,090 --> 05:18:53,390
There we go.

6902
05:18:54,790 --> 05:18:56,210
What the fuck is this?

6903
05:19:02,040 --> 05:19:03,320
What the fuck?

6904
05:19:03,360 --> 05:19:04,160
Wait, he missed.

6905
05:19:07,340 --> 05:19:08,740
Wait, he missed.

6906
05:19:09,760 --> 05:19:11,280
How do you miss?

6907
05:19:11,360 --> 05:19:11,940
Exactly!

6908
05:19:14,660 --> 05:19:16,140
How do you miss?

6909
05:19:16,910 --> 05:19:17,700
I'm contesting.

6910
05:19:20,860 --> 05:19:22,260
He missed.

6911
05:19:24,200 --> 05:19:25,680
That's what happened.

6912
05:19:27,120 --> 05:19:29,940
We all were like, how did you miss?

6913
05:19:30,300 --> 05:19:32,760
Like, all of us were confused.

6914
05:19:35,240 --> 05:19:38,480
We all wanted to know how that was possible.

6915
05:19:39,780 --> 05:19:41,520
I guess I died.

6916
05:19:43,920 --> 05:19:45,520
Yeah, no, he missed.

6917
05:19:45,520 --> 05:19:47,540
I'm just as surprised.

6918
05:19:51,940 --> 05:19:56,200
Okay, the match is about to finish in like a minute.

6919
05:19:56,560 --> 05:19:57,720
Can we finish this in five?

6920
05:19:59,640 --> 05:20:00,460
Oh no.

6921
05:20:01,740 --> 05:20:02,640
Oh no.

6922
05:20:09,120 --> 05:20:11,000
I froze somebody.

6923
05:20:11,000 --> 05:20:11,160
Somebody!

6924
05:20:14,020 --> 05:20:17,420
Oh, that's a huge ult.

6925
05:20:18,860 --> 05:20:19,580
Yeah, shield.

6926
05:20:22,540 --> 05:20:24,140
That's unlucky.

6927
05:20:40,750 --> 05:20:43,850
Oh my god, I gotta jungle this!

6928
05:20:47,540 --> 05:20:49,300
Alright, two more minutes!

6929
05:20:49,940 --> 05:20:50,880
Two more minutes!

6930
05:20:55,740 --> 05:20:56,980
Two more minutes!

6931
05:21:03,720 --> 05:21:04,740
Alright, I'm bubbling.

6932
05:21:06,600 --> 05:21:07,580
Ready, ready, ready.

6933
05:21:08,020 --> 05:21:08,320
Here we go.

6934
05:21:12,200 --> 05:21:13,760
I need a reload.

6935
05:21:14,540 --> 05:21:16,020
Bro, I need a reload.

6936
05:21:21,740 --> 05:21:22,780
Oh my!

6937
05:21:23,840 --> 05:21:24,840
I'm still looking for it.

6938
05:21:24,860 --> 05:21:25,320
Oh my god.

6939
05:21:27,060 --> 05:21:27,580
No!

6940
05:21:28,260 --> 05:21:28,880
Oh my.

6941
05:21:29,620 --> 05:21:30,180
Oh no.

6942
05:21:30,400 --> 05:21:31,040
No!

6943
05:21:32,920 --> 05:21:33,720
No!

6944
05:21:34,180 --> 05:21:36,140
You fucking strange N!

6945
05:21:37,440 --> 05:21:39,260
Oh, they born again.

6946
05:21:40,540 --> 05:21:42,560
Oh, they born again.

6947
05:22:01,290 --> 05:22:02,810
Oh my god.

6948
05:22:03,690 --> 05:22:06,030
Oh no, I might be fucking dead.

6949
05:22:06,430 --> 05:22:07,530
Oh thank god.

6950
05:22:09,910 --> 05:22:12,170
Three, two, one.

6951
05:22:17,070 --> 05:22:18,690
I have strange on us.

6952
05:22:25,440 --> 05:22:26,040
No!

6953
05:22:42,540 --> 05:22:43,140
No!

6954
05:22:49,720 --> 05:22:53,600
Guys, go miss my latest Sentinels match, but it's not my fault.

6955
05:22:55,620 --> 05:23:03,000
Guys, if any Sentinels fanboys or his team is watching me right now, it is not my fault.

6956
05:23:03,060 --> 05:23:04,240
I swear to god.

6957
05:23:08,440 --> 05:23:10,600
It's not my fault.

6958
05:23:12,080 --> 05:23:13,500
Oh, thank god.

6959
05:23:14,000 --> 05:23:14,540
Go miss.

6960
05:23:14,940 --> 05:23:15,440
Black quest won.

6961
05:23:15,540 --> 05:23:16,120
You're safe.

6962
05:23:17,760 --> 05:23:18,560
Wait, what?

6963
05:23:18,900 --> 05:23:19,240
Wait, they won?

6964
05:23:19,540 --> 05:23:20,760
Yeah, you're safe.

6965
05:23:20,860 --> 05:23:21,540
Wait, they won him out?

6966
05:23:21,740 --> 05:23:22,320
Yeah.

6967
05:23:23,600 --> 05:23:25,300
No way.

6968
05:23:28,460 --> 05:23:30,260
Getting dicked on right now.

6969
05:23:36,600 --> 05:23:38,500
We're never punished!

6970
05:23:40,480 --> 05:23:41,880
Yippee!

6971
05:23:46,340 --> 05:23:47,040
Alright.

6972
05:23:48,520 --> 05:23:49,620
Let's go!

6973
05:23:53,600 --> 05:23:54,660
We're almost fight night.

6974
05:24:00,920 --> 05:24:02,080
We're safe!

6975
05:24:02,200 --> 05:24:04,260
It's not my fault!

6976
05:24:11,440 --> 05:24:16,980
Look how I can't hear what British Tree says because I don't want my feelings to get hurt.

6977
05:24:17,440 --> 05:24:17,880
Hahaha!

6978
05:24:22,660 --> 05:24:24,460
You guys didn't see that, guys.

6979
05:24:29,800 --> 05:24:30,520
It's okay.

6980
05:24:30,640 --> 05:24:33,240
Our man has saved me.

6981
05:24:39,240 --> 05:24:40,800
Guys, you didn't see it, guys.

6982
05:24:44,120 --> 05:24:45,100
Okay, I need to focus.

6983
05:24:45,280 --> 05:24:45,780
I need to focus.

6984
05:24:45,860 --> 05:24:46,900
I actually need to focus here.

6985
05:24:50,380 --> 05:24:52,160
Oh my god.

6986
05:25:00,460 --> 05:25:03,920
Oh my god.

6987
05:25:06,220 --> 05:25:06,960
How the...

6988
05:25:09,400 --> 05:25:14,040
How the fuck did they got Mantis ult so fast?

6989
05:25:18,620 --> 05:25:20,520
Like, how the fuck?

6990
05:25:22,280 --> 05:25:25,520
That's crazy they got Mantis ult that fast.

6991
05:25:33,200 --> 05:25:34,800
It's not my fault.

6992
05:25:36,620 --> 05:25:37,280
There's someone above.

6993
05:25:52,750 --> 05:25:54,610
Oh my god!

6994
05:25:55,990 --> 05:25:57,150
Do you have shield?

6995
05:25:59,590 --> 05:26:02,090
Oh my god, thank god.

6996
05:26:02,610 --> 05:26:03,570
Hi!

6997
05:26:10,490 --> 05:26:12,090
Oh my god!

6998
05:26:15,440 --> 05:26:17,060
There's a Scyther behind us.

6999
05:26:20,910 --> 05:26:21,530
No!

7000
05:26:22,650 --> 05:26:23,610
Adam!

7001
05:26:27,550 --> 05:26:28,510
No.

7002
05:26:29,730 --> 05:26:33,550
This Adam is not good at... at Adam.

7003
05:26:35,690 --> 05:26:39,930
This Adam has had a lot of really bad Adam ults.

7004
05:26:40,010 --> 05:26:40,910
I'm gonna say it.

7005
05:26:44,810 --> 05:26:47,530
I'm gonna say it.

7006
05:26:48,070 --> 05:26:48,070
Like,

7007
05:26:51,530 --> 05:26:53,410
it has definitely not been ideal.

7008
05:26:53,890 --> 05:27:03,190
Their Adam has definitely not been playing very well.

7009
05:27:06,670 --> 05:27:08,090
It's okay, guys.

7010
05:27:08,790 --> 05:27:12,050
It's fine because in the end it's definitely not my fault.

7011
05:27:13,570 --> 05:27:14,670
His ult has been really bad.

7012
05:27:14,850 --> 05:27:19,510
His ult placement is just...

7013
05:27:29,620 --> 05:27:30,500
Placing shields.

7014
05:27:31,420 --> 05:27:32,660
Makes sense to shield.

7015
05:27:41,520 --> 05:27:43,240
Oh nice, a C9!

7016
05:27:43,420 --> 05:27:43,960
Thank god.

7017
05:27:45,260 --> 05:27:46,240
Thank god.

7018
05:27:47,740 --> 05:27:50,500
I think the EU buff is losing its effect now.

7019
05:27:51,440 --> 05:27:52,820
I think so too, guys.

7020
05:27:53,380 --> 05:27:54,940
I think so too.

7021
05:28:02,220 --> 05:28:07,500
I sort of want to play Adam because their Adam resists are so bad.

7022
05:28:07,700 --> 05:28:09,640
They're so bad.

7023
05:28:17,560 --> 05:28:18,220
What are you playing?

7024
05:28:21,540 --> 05:28:22,320
What are you usually playing?

7025
05:28:24,820 --> 05:28:26,520
I'm just playing really bad on mag right now.

7026
05:28:26,760 --> 05:28:27,600
Any DPS.

7027
05:28:31,080 --> 05:28:32,940
I just think I'm not getting any value right now.

7028
05:28:33,080 --> 05:28:34,020
I'm not playing well on mag.

7029
05:28:34,900 --> 05:28:37,140
Can you make the Bucky work?

7030
05:28:38,920 --> 05:28:39,560
Nah, I'm really good.

7031
05:28:39,620 --> 05:28:40,180
They banned it though.

7032
05:28:41,700 --> 05:28:43,180
Man, you said you could play any DPS.

7033
05:28:43,260 --> 05:28:43,600
What do you mean?

7034
05:28:44,760 --> 05:28:46,640
They banned it.

7035
05:28:46,640 --> 05:28:47,300
Oh wait, did they?

7036
05:28:49,700 --> 05:28:51,620
Okay, now we call out others.

7037
05:28:51,820 --> 05:28:54,480
You saw the Adam resists!

7038
05:28:54,760 --> 05:28:57,040
They were both bad!

7039
05:28:59,480 --> 05:29:02,500
You all saw the Adam resists!

7040
05:29:02,660 --> 05:29:04,520
Don't fucking lie to me!

7041
05:29:04,640 --> 05:29:05,300
Stop coping!

7042
05:29:05,620 --> 05:29:08,240
You all saw the Adam resists!

7043
05:29:09,240 --> 05:29:14,240
You cannot say I'm fucking coping when we saw what we saw!

7044
05:29:20,180 --> 05:29:22,020
I'll fucking tear you!

7045
05:29:40,780 --> 05:29:41,920
Loki 1-8-3.

7046
05:29:58,500 --> 05:30:09,800
I don't know if this works, guys.

7047
05:30:10,600 --> 05:30:11,960
I think we need the mag.

7048
05:30:13,900 --> 05:30:16,880
I think we might need the mag in stream.

7049
05:30:20,340 --> 05:30:21,060
Guys,

7050
05:30:24,720 --> 05:30:26,720
I don't think this is winnable anymore.

7051
05:30:34,720 --> 05:30:41,080
Guys, I think this might be a cheat sheet.

7052
05:30:42,980 --> 05:30:43,740
Hehehe.

7053
05:30:53,660 --> 05:30:55,180
Oh nice!

7054
05:30:55,880 --> 05:30:59,540
Oh my god, they're giving us everything we've ever wanted.

7055
05:31:03,370 --> 05:31:04,850
I'm damage boosting.

7056
05:31:06,230 --> 05:31:06,710
I got shield.

7057
05:31:09,790 --> 05:31:11,430
They have strange ult.

7058
05:31:13,710 --> 05:31:14,750
I froze him.

7059
05:31:25,250 --> 05:31:25,470
Alright.

7060
05:31:28,890 --> 05:31:33,530
Guys, a miracle just happened and then we're gonna lose at the last point, maybe.

7061
05:31:33,630 --> 05:31:34,050
I don't know.

7062
05:31:34,430 --> 05:31:35,570
I'm trying not to be a doomer.

7063
05:31:35,710 --> 05:31:37,650
I'm just trying to have no expectations right now.

7064
05:31:40,830 --> 05:31:45,390
So, if we do lose, at least I won't be disappointed.

7065
05:31:48,250 --> 05:31:49,570
I smell garlic.

7066
05:31:50,990 --> 05:31:54,130
Someone in my house is cooking.

7067
05:31:57,830 --> 05:32:00,510
What the fuck?

7068
05:32:01,570 --> 05:32:05,970
Oh my god!

7069
05:32:06,070 --> 05:32:07,190
I'm not the problem.

7070
05:32:07,770 --> 05:32:14,630
I am absolutely not a problem there.

7071
05:32:14,970 --> 05:32:16,610
Bro, what?

7072
05:32:18,530 --> 05:32:22,610
Guys, that's how you actually... that's how you do it.

7073
05:32:23,290 --> 05:32:25,470
That's how you do it all.

7074
05:32:32,670 --> 05:32:33,610
Oh, why?

7075
05:32:38,340 --> 05:32:38,900
Why?

7076
05:32:43,040 --> 05:32:46,540
We did not need to use second chance, but okay.

7077
05:32:46,540 --> 05:32:46,900
Do a frontline.

7078
05:32:50,240 --> 05:32:52,740
Oh my god.

7079
05:32:53,280 --> 05:32:54,740
Do a frontline.

7080
05:33:00,470 --> 05:33:03,410
Guys, that's an Adam all right there.

7081
05:33:06,530 --> 05:33:06,990
Fear.

7082
05:33:07,290 --> 05:33:07,910
Fear.

7083
05:33:07,910 --> 05:33:07,970
Fear.

7084
05:33:14,830 --> 05:33:16,670
Okay, guys.

7085
05:33:17,310 --> 05:33:24,790
Seeing that Adamrez, our Adamrez, and also our Strangelove.

7086
05:33:25,550 --> 05:33:26,510
All right, guys.

7087
05:33:26,770 --> 05:33:28,370
Do you really think I'm coping?

7088
05:33:30,810 --> 05:33:31,530
Yeah.

7089
05:33:37,910 --> 05:33:38,290
Yeah.

7090
05:33:39,070 --> 05:33:39,630
Yeah.

7091
05:33:40,630 --> 05:33:40,830
Yeah.

7092
05:33:40,830 --> 05:33:41,190
Yeah.

7093
05:33:43,750 --> 05:33:44,310
I...

7094
05:33:53,000 --> 05:33:53,560
Again.

7095
05:33:54,780 --> 05:33:56,860
Oh my... Bro, get out.

7096
05:33:57,780 --> 05:33:59,700
I'm not getting my ult in time.

7097
05:34:02,360 --> 05:34:05,320
They used my ult in the fight before, but they don't have my ult.

7098
05:34:11,930 --> 05:34:15,330
Guys, I'm... I know that I'm doing the best I can.

7099
05:34:16,910 --> 05:34:23,880
I mean, you know, I'm just happy to be... to win some... to win at least...

7100
05:34:27,750 --> 05:34:28,370
Play up.

7101
05:34:28,450 --> 05:34:28,790
We have link.

7102
05:34:29,450 --> 05:34:30,490
Watch out for this range behind us.

7103
05:34:34,610 --> 05:34:35,710
Keep looking this range.

7104
05:34:37,650 --> 05:34:38,430
There's no shield.

7105
05:34:40,390 --> 05:34:41,310
We have Luna ult.

7106
05:34:43,090 --> 05:34:44,650
All right, here we go.

7107
05:34:47,870 --> 05:34:49,550
Oh, thank god.

7108
05:34:50,410 --> 05:34:53,390
They definitely have Strangelove, by the way.

7109
05:34:58,390 --> 05:34:59,530
Oh god.

7110
05:35:05,640 --> 05:35:08,260
Oh my god.

7111
05:35:14,250 --> 05:35:17,290
I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going.

7112
05:35:17,450 --> 05:35:19,290
I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm not going.

7113
05:35:19,430 --> 05:35:20,090
No more.

7114
05:35:21,950 --> 05:35:26,290
Guys, I think this guy is definitely... This guy is a strange player.

7115
05:35:26,710 --> 05:35:29,050
We definitely did not have a strange player, guys.

7116
05:35:30,190 --> 05:35:30,630
Guys,

7117
05:35:33,850 --> 05:35:37,470
I just don't think we had a strange or an Adam player.

7118
05:35:37,990 --> 05:35:39,350
We definitely did not.

7119
05:35:39,590 --> 05:35:40,510
Yeah, you're fucking dead.

7120
05:35:40,570 --> 05:35:41,350
What the hell are you doing?

7121
05:35:41,930 --> 05:35:43,210
You don't know how to live.

7122
05:35:43,210 --> 05:35:44,490
What the fuck?

7123
05:35:47,530 --> 05:35:52,830
That was definitely not my... I know that wasn't my fault.

7124
05:35:53,290 --> 05:36:02,450
I know, for real, that that was most definitely not my fault.

7125
05:36:11,930 --> 05:36:13,670
Holy fuck.

7126
05:36:16,850 --> 05:36:18,310
Oh shit, let's kill.

7127
05:36:18,850 --> 05:36:19,670
Wait.

7128
05:36:20,470 --> 05:36:21,590
Did you avoid?

7129
05:36:24,550 --> 05:36:27,550
Alright, let's try it.

7130
05:36:27,730 --> 05:36:30,770
Alright, let's tempt fate again.

7131
05:36:34,810 --> 05:36:39,150
Let's fucking tempt fate once again.

7132
05:36:44,600 --> 05:36:46,120
He's like, let's try it.

7133
05:36:46,180 --> 05:36:46,580
Let's do it.

7134
05:36:46,880 --> 05:36:48,200
Let's try again.

7135
05:36:48,400 --> 05:36:49,160
Alright, let's see.

7136
05:36:49,360 --> 05:36:52,220
Is there anyone online that I can steal?

7137
05:36:53,640 --> 05:36:59,720
At least... No, everybody has their own stack, unless I can mooch off of their stack and be like, do you guys want a four stack?

7138
05:37:00,760 --> 05:37:02,620
I swear to god, I'm not the problem.

7139
05:37:02,780 --> 05:37:03,840
Don't look at my history.

7140
05:37:06,420 --> 05:37:10,360
As long as no one else snitches me out, should be fine.

7141
05:37:14,260 --> 05:37:15,900
Guys, it's okay.

7142
05:37:16,160 --> 05:37:19,940
Look, I'm watching... I'm watching the game right now.

7143
05:37:20,080 --> 05:37:25,260
It looks like 100 thieves could potentially get fold held.

7144
05:37:25,780 --> 05:37:29,520
So like, that means it could go 2-2, guys.

7145
05:37:29,860 --> 05:37:32,360
It could potentially go 2-2, guys.

7146
05:37:32,520 --> 05:37:34,580
And you know what that means.

7147
05:37:39,240 --> 05:37:43,960
You know what that means, guys.

7148
05:37:46,180 --> 05:37:46,700
Potentially.

7149
05:37:46,700 --> 05:37:49,220
Yeah, potentially, we'll be okay.

7150
05:37:49,700 --> 05:37:51,320
We'll be okay.

7151
05:37:53,040 --> 05:37:55,040
This will make me happy.

7152
05:37:55,860 --> 05:37:59,400
This will satisfy me for the rest of the night.

7153
05:38:00,280 --> 05:38:00,980
It's okay.

7154
05:38:01,760 --> 05:38:02,780
I'm okay.

7155
05:38:06,960 --> 05:38:08,540
I'm okay, guys.

7156
05:38:08,680 --> 05:38:12,760
I don't know, like, there's a lot of people that I don't know who sent me requests.

7157
05:38:14,760 --> 05:38:21,480
As long as... I'm just gonna put all the eternity players in standby until now.

7158
05:38:22,900 --> 05:38:30,720
Oh my god, that... wait, I'm gonna ask, did you avoid our Adam yet?

7159
05:38:30,860 --> 05:38:32,440
Our Adam or no?

7160
05:38:33,380 --> 05:38:37,340
Cause our Adam was questionable.

7161
05:38:44,860 --> 05:38:49,400
Okay, alright, the Adam was not avoided as well, so we're gonna get rid of that guy.

7162
05:38:53,700 --> 05:38:56,900
We're gonna get rid of the Adam player as well.

7163
05:38:57,880 --> 05:39:00,880
As long as none of these people are on my team, I will be okay.

7164
05:39:02,160 --> 05:39:03,420
Guys, how many points did I lose?

7165
05:39:03,480 --> 05:39:08,420
I don't wanna check my... I don't wanna check my history right now.

7166
05:39:08,540 --> 05:39:09,460
I think I'll cry.

7167
05:39:17,320 --> 05:39:21,060
How much... does anyone know how much I lost that last game?

7168
05:39:21,540 --> 05:39:24,120
Guys, that last... don't tell me about overall.

7169
05:39:24,540 --> 05:39:26,620
Like, I know I lost a lot.

7170
05:39:27,380 --> 05:39:29,680
But, like, the last game.

7171
05:39:29,760 --> 05:39:31,680
Does anyone know the last game?

7172
05:39:31,780 --> 05:39:32,600
How much I lost?

7173
05:39:32,680 --> 05:39:34,840
Surely someone in my chat has remembered it.

7174
05:39:36,300 --> 05:39:36,900
Surely...

7175
05:39:44,660 --> 05:39:45,260
Surely...

7176
05:39:45,840 --> 05:39:50,840
Guys, I'm not talking about... I'm not talking about overall, guys.

7177
05:39:51,000 --> 05:39:52,440
Okay, you get it, you fuckers.

7178
05:39:52,600 --> 05:39:54,940
Okay, I can't believe it.

7179
05:39:55,540 --> 05:39:57,660
Guys, if I sniffle, it's not because I'm crying.

7180
05:39:58,440 --> 05:39:59,640
It's just allergies.

7181
05:40:07,140 --> 05:40:07,820
Oh.

7182
05:40:07,820 --> 05:40:10,980
Oh my god, my allergies are acting up again.

7183
05:40:11,480 --> 05:40:13,160
Oh, my allergies.

7184
05:40:15,740 --> 05:40:18,160
Oh, my poor allergies, guys.

7185
05:40:18,500 --> 05:40:21,560
My poor allergies, they're acting up right now.

7186
05:40:22,900 --> 05:40:24,460
Damn, it's hitting hard.

7187
05:40:28,760 --> 05:40:29,920
I'm okay.

7188
05:40:30,340 --> 05:40:33,660
The pain and sorrow in her voice.

7189
05:40:37,360 --> 05:40:38,860
Oh, my god.

7190
05:40:39,820 --> 05:40:40,880
There we go.

7191
05:40:41,860 --> 05:40:42,860
It's okay, guys.

7192
05:40:43,640 --> 05:40:44,420
I'm okay.

7193
05:40:45,300 --> 05:40:47,440
Guys, it's... I'm okay.

7194
05:40:47,500 --> 05:40:49,420
There's no fixing me, but I'm okay.

7195
05:40:50,680 --> 05:40:55,340
Everybody, there's nothing... there's no way to fix this.

7196
05:40:55,780 --> 05:41:02,080
This damn ninja slicing onions in your room again.

7197
05:41:02,160 --> 05:41:02,380
Yeah.

7198
05:41:03,080 --> 05:41:03,960
Yeah.

7199
05:41:06,580 --> 05:41:07,940
It's fine.

7200
05:41:11,320 --> 05:41:13,520
Oh, look at this.

7201
05:41:13,600 --> 05:41:14,900
This will make me happy.

7202
05:41:14,900 --> 05:41:16,660
Does, like, the thing have anything?

7203
05:41:17,380 --> 05:41:18,540
I'm actually curious.

7204
05:41:20,020 --> 05:41:20,640
The thing.

7205
05:41:22,060 --> 05:41:23,320
How do I change this?

7206
05:41:23,540 --> 05:41:24,380
Change it again.

7207
05:41:24,420 --> 05:41:25,080
I don't remember.

7208
05:41:26,000 --> 05:41:27,300
How do I change this?

7209
05:41:27,660 --> 05:41:28,200
Oh, here you go.

7210
05:41:28,220 --> 05:41:28,840
Change heroes.

7211
05:41:29,160 --> 05:41:29,400
Alright.

7212
05:41:33,980 --> 05:41:35,480
No, it's a little flat.

7213
05:41:35,800 --> 05:41:37,260
It's not really... No.

7214
05:41:37,760 --> 05:41:38,940
I mean, it's there.

7215
05:41:39,100 --> 05:41:42,220
There's the curvature, but it's a little...

7216
05:41:42,580 --> 05:41:45,660
No, it's not as perky as I would like it.

7217
05:41:45,660 --> 05:41:50,100
I feel like... What about the... Okay, what about Human Torch?

7218
05:41:50,920 --> 05:41:51,460
Oh, no.

7219
05:41:51,520 --> 05:41:52,480
That's flat as fuck.

7220
05:41:52,620 --> 05:41:53,460
He has no ass.

7221
05:41:53,800 --> 05:41:55,320
The Human Torch has no ass.

7222
05:41:56,060 --> 05:41:58,080
I mean, what about Mr. Fantastic?

7223
05:41:58,500 --> 05:41:59,500
Does he have an ass?

7224
05:42:00,560 --> 05:42:01,000
Whoa!

7225
05:42:01,460 --> 05:42:02,660
I mean...

7226
05:42:03,740 --> 05:42:04,880
He chose this.

7227
05:42:11,070 --> 05:42:15,290
He chose the size of the butt, basically.

7228
05:42:16,090 --> 05:42:16,690
Whoa!

7229
05:42:17,050 --> 05:42:17,890
Look at that!

7230
05:42:18,730 --> 05:42:23,810
And he, like, snaps his... He, like, snapped it back as well.

7231
05:42:23,890 --> 05:42:25,270
Like, the curve here.

7232
05:42:25,490 --> 05:42:26,950
He knows what he wants to show.

7233
05:42:27,510 --> 05:42:28,770
He could buff it.

7234
05:42:28,890 --> 05:42:29,150
True.

7235
05:42:29,550 --> 05:42:29,910
True.

7236
05:42:30,010 --> 05:42:31,010
He could buff it.

7237
05:42:32,130 --> 05:42:34,990
What about... Does Punisher have... What about Punisher?

7238
05:42:35,330 --> 05:42:36,190
No, he's flat.

7239
05:42:36,550 --> 05:42:36,890
No.

7240
05:42:37,950 --> 05:42:39,010
No booty.

7241
05:42:39,310 --> 05:42:40,470
No cake for him.

7242
05:42:41,090 --> 05:42:45,310
How about... Black Panther must have an ass.

7243
05:42:46,270 --> 05:42:46,630
Oh!

7244
05:42:47,310 --> 05:42:48,530
Wait a minute!

7245
05:42:49,490 --> 05:42:50,110
Wow!

7246
05:42:51,170 --> 05:42:52,090
Look at that!

7247
05:43:00,330 --> 05:43:01,570
Wow!

7248
05:43:03,230 --> 05:43:05,530
The hidden gem!

7249
05:43:06,290 --> 05:43:06,930
Damn!

7250
05:43:06,930 --> 05:43:08,290
Look at that!

7251
05:43:08,490 --> 05:43:09,770
Oh, and he's flaunting it!

7252
05:43:09,770 --> 05:43:10,490
You see that?

7253
05:43:11,210 --> 05:43:13,330
See how he's like, yeah, I got that.

7254
05:43:13,530 --> 05:43:15,050
I got those.

7255
05:43:15,490 --> 05:43:15,850
But...

7256
05:43:19,840 --> 05:43:22,840
No, but Venom... I think Venom is the best one.

7257
05:43:22,960 --> 05:43:32,860
If I have to rate the... If I do a tier list of, like, Marvel rivals' booties, I think Venom is 100%, like, the best one out of all of them.

7258
05:43:33,600 --> 05:43:34,060
I think.

7259
05:43:35,160 --> 05:43:37,220
Someone's like, check Rocket Raccoon.

7260
05:43:37,220 --> 05:43:39,740
That fucking tail is covering it.

7261
05:43:39,820 --> 05:43:40,740
We'll never know.

7262
05:43:41,220 --> 05:43:42,820
We'll never fucking know.

7263
05:43:43,700 --> 05:43:44,320
How about Jeff?

7264
05:43:45,240 --> 05:43:47,540
Like, he's a shark, but he's still...

7265
05:43:47,540 --> 05:43:51,840
Oh, I guess, like, it doesn't... When they have... They get, like, a tail debuff, I guess.

7266
05:43:52,280 --> 05:43:56,360
When you have a tail, it gets debuffed, so you don't really have an ass after that.

7267
05:43:58,280 --> 05:43:59,160
What about...

7268
05:43:59,160 --> 05:44:00,520
No, it's pretty flat.

7269
05:44:03,120 --> 05:44:03,560
No.

7270
05:44:04,360 --> 05:44:04,860
No.

7271
05:44:06,600 --> 05:44:07,400
I don't know.

7272
05:44:07,680 --> 05:44:09,420
I mean, it looks like...

7273
05:44:09,420 --> 05:44:10,080
I don't know.

7274
05:44:10,140 --> 05:44:11,800
It's like a canyon in between.

7275
05:44:12,460 --> 05:44:17,120
It's just, like, the distance between the two is a little too far.

7276
05:44:27,210 --> 05:44:29,250
Alright, who do we have?

7277
05:44:35,870 --> 05:44:40,070
Alright, who's in my team?

7278
05:44:40,470 --> 05:44:42,410
We have... Oh, JessieJudoMan!

7279
05:44:43,550 --> 05:44:45,490
We have JessieJudoMan.

7280
05:44:46,350 --> 05:44:48,350
I always... I trust Jessie.

7281
05:44:52,230 --> 05:44:54,750
Jessie... Wait, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

7282
05:44:54,910 --> 05:44:55,990
Okay, and then he's a 6.

7283
05:44:58,350 --> 05:44:59,230
Okay, JessieJudoMan.

7284
05:44:59,230 --> 05:45:01,550
Jessie... I have no idea who some of these people are.

7285
05:45:04,030 --> 05:45:05,810
Only conquers worthy winners.

7286
05:45:05,930 --> 05:45:07,610
You have to regain your worth in Rivals.

7287
05:45:07,650 --> 05:45:08,230
They want...

7288
05:45:10,090 --> 05:45:12,050
Thank you for the super chat.

7289
05:45:12,130 --> 05:45:13,170
Thank you, thank you.

7290
05:45:13,490 --> 05:45:14,590
I'm banning Groot.

7291
05:45:14,610 --> 05:45:15,490
I don't fucking care.

7292
05:45:16,210 --> 05:45:20,670
I don't know if... Guys, I don't know if... Guys, guys.

7293
05:45:20,810 --> 05:45:23,650
If Gomez is late for his tournament, it's not my fault.

7294
05:45:24,070 --> 05:45:26,230
He said requeue.

7295
05:45:26,850 --> 05:45:28,310
Guys, it's not my fault.

7296
05:45:29,230 --> 05:45:29,230
Oh

7297
05:45:33,380 --> 05:45:35,100
no.

7298
05:45:36,160 --> 05:45:40,480
It's okay.

7299
05:45:44,100 --> 05:45:45,380
It'll be okay.

7300
05:45:45,960 --> 05:45:47,500
It'll be okay.

7301
05:45:49,220 --> 05:45:50,160
All right, we just got Mantis.

7302
05:45:50,260 --> 05:45:51,140
No, Jessie, you got it, bro.

7303
05:45:51,260 --> 05:45:51,540
All you.

7304
05:45:52,740 --> 05:45:57,160
Literally, we just... We literally just switched damage boosting Luna and Loki off.

7305
05:45:57,220 --> 05:45:58,420
And we team wiped them.

7306
05:45:58,540 --> 05:45:58,700
Easy.

7307
05:46:01,780 --> 05:46:02,740
It's not my fault.

7308
05:46:03,880 --> 05:46:04,620
No, no.

7309
05:46:05,220 --> 05:46:06,840
Sometimes things are my fault.

7310
05:46:06,980 --> 05:46:10,780
But in this particular instance, he said requeue.

7311
05:46:10,920 --> 05:46:12,640
And I was like, okay.

7312
05:46:13,500 --> 05:46:18,060
I can play Thing instead of Mantis so we can group tank.

7313
05:46:19,100 --> 05:46:20,640
And that is up to you guys.

7314
05:46:21,860 --> 05:46:22,540
It's not my fault.

7315
05:46:23,920 --> 05:46:25,640
When is it my fault?

7316
05:46:27,380 --> 05:46:30,720
Guys, look, today is definitely not my fault.

7317
05:46:30,980 --> 05:46:31,700
Guys, please.

7318
05:46:34,380 --> 05:46:37,620
It only takes one bad day.

7319
05:46:39,160 --> 05:46:40,180
I approve with no water.

7320
05:46:40,180 --> 05:46:43,740
It only takes one bad day to make me... Guys, please.

7321
05:46:45,360 --> 05:46:49,360
You don't want to know what happens when I get to that day.

7322
05:46:50,120 --> 05:46:51,040
Wait, wait, fireman.

7323
05:46:51,200 --> 05:46:51,920
Fireman, watch out.

7324
05:46:54,360 --> 05:46:54,920
Fireman.

7325
05:46:56,620 --> 05:46:59,140
What the fuck is fireman doing here?

7326
05:47:09,510 --> 05:47:10,070
Whoa.

7327
05:47:15,790 --> 05:47:16,990
Whoa, careful.

7328
05:47:18,090 --> 05:47:18,810
Yeah, we got it all.

7329
05:47:18,810 --> 05:47:19,270
What?

7330
05:47:20,350 --> 05:47:22,110
I did not expect that.

7331
05:47:22,590 --> 05:47:23,810
Did they have a Hawkeye?

7332
05:47:25,650 --> 05:47:26,690
No, the...

7333
05:47:26,690 --> 05:47:29,130
Their Human Torso did 300 damage to me.

7334
05:47:29,950 --> 05:47:31,530
Whoa, the buff.

7335
05:47:36,790 --> 05:47:38,430
Wait, those buffs actually made him good.

7336
05:47:40,510 --> 05:47:41,630
Oh, there's a Sidelock on me?

7337
05:47:43,090 --> 05:47:44,750
They added two extra power buffs.

7338
05:47:44,750 --> 05:47:46,570
What the hell?

7339
05:47:47,010 --> 05:47:47,490
I'm hurt.

7340
05:47:47,790 --> 05:47:48,910
Where's Sidelock at?

7341
05:47:50,030 --> 05:47:51,070
I'm sorry, hold on.

7342
05:47:51,070 --> 05:47:53,130
The Sidelock is still behind us.

7343
05:47:55,770 --> 05:47:58,850
Yo, Sidelock, why did we wake him?

7344
05:47:59,290 --> 05:48:00,830
Because I didn't expect you to sleep him.

7345
05:48:01,370 --> 05:48:07,380
The Sidelock is still doing Sidelock things.

7346
05:48:09,480 --> 05:48:10,320
He's dead.

7347
05:48:14,830 --> 05:48:15,450
Oh.

7348
05:48:15,450 --> 05:48:16,050
Oh.

7349
05:48:21,810 --> 05:48:22,670
Mantis first?

7350
05:48:28,050 --> 05:48:29,370
I froze somebody.

7351
05:48:39,610 --> 05:48:40,850
Wait, Megwin, Megwin!

7352
05:48:41,230 --> 05:48:42,290
Oh, he's still there.

7353
05:48:46,150 --> 05:48:46,890
I'm fine.

7354
05:48:48,070 --> 05:48:48,890
I'm okay.

7355
05:48:52,270 --> 05:48:53,790
I'm walking up, I'm walking up.

7356
05:48:53,790 --> 05:48:57,030
4, 3, 2, 1.

7357
05:49:07,300 --> 05:49:08,280
Meg is low.

7358
05:49:08,780 --> 05:49:09,300
Meg won.

7359
05:49:15,120 --> 05:49:15,680
Wait,

7360
05:49:18,900 --> 05:49:19,720
they only have one support.

7361
05:49:21,200 --> 05:49:22,540
Okay, I'm on open mic now.

7362
05:49:24,860 --> 05:49:26,100
Wait, I am...

7363
05:49:26,100 --> 05:49:27,240
Are those buffs live?

7364
05:49:28,060 --> 05:49:28,340
Yeah.

7365
05:49:32,660 --> 05:49:34,780
Wait, they have two supports now, they have two supports.

7366
05:49:35,980 --> 05:49:36,740
Oh, they fixed it.

7367
05:49:43,740 --> 05:49:49,420
Oh my god, the building fucking rebuilt itself!

7368
05:49:53,520 --> 05:49:54,780
Wait, Meg is low.

7369
05:50:02,390 --> 05:50:03,170
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

7370
05:50:04,570 --> 05:50:05,550
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

7371
05:50:17,430 --> 05:50:18,770
Oh my god.

7372
05:50:19,910 --> 05:50:20,370
Maltus?

7373
05:50:27,850 --> 05:50:29,170
There's a Sidelock behind us.

7374
05:50:32,970 --> 05:50:35,390
Yeah, fuck that Luna in particular.

7375
05:50:39,530 --> 05:50:40,690
Megwin, Megwin!

7376
05:50:41,690 --> 05:50:42,730
There's a Sidelock left.

7377
05:50:44,790 --> 05:50:45,470
Sidelock's one.

7378
05:50:57,050 --> 05:50:58,870
They have Hella now.

7379
05:51:01,070 --> 05:51:02,850
Oh my god.

7380
05:51:02,890 --> 05:51:07,510
I'm so... I can't make funny haha commentary, I'm too focused.

7381
05:51:08,190 --> 05:51:12,470
Like, what is going on?!

7382
05:51:19,530 --> 05:51:27,130
I hear the Sidelock around me.

7383
05:51:28,830 --> 05:51:29,850
He's roaming.

7384
05:51:38,720 --> 05:51:40,140
There's a Sidelock on cart.

7385
05:51:41,360 --> 05:51:42,340
Oh, he got up.

7386
05:51:45,860 --> 05:51:46,840
He's half.

7387
05:51:50,360 --> 05:51:52,000
Oh my god!

7388
05:51:54,700 --> 05:51:57,680
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

7389
05:52:00,960 --> 05:52:02,540
That's a big dodge killer!

7390
05:52:06,600 --> 05:52:08,600
What the fuck was that?!

7391
05:52:20,410 --> 05:52:22,750
Oh my god.

7392
05:52:24,270 --> 05:52:27,130
Holy shit, that scared the shit out of me.

7393
05:52:31,410 --> 05:52:33,950
Me team is a joke.

7394
05:52:37,350 --> 05:52:38,550
Oh my god.

7395
05:52:39,410 --> 05:52:43,910
I was just smiling and the fucking Sidelock came out of nowhere.

7396
05:52:44,270 --> 05:52:46,370
I'm like, holy fuck.

7397
05:52:52,290 --> 05:52:55,170
I'm surprised we all lived there.

7398
05:52:55,310 --> 05:52:58,870
I'm actually so surprised we managed to live there.

7399
05:52:59,290 --> 05:53:01,130
That was fucking wild.

7400
05:53:01,590 --> 05:53:05,170
That was fucking... that was wild.

7401
05:53:13,750 --> 05:53:17,940
Wait, we banned pro-Styler and he started...

7402
05:53:28,870 --> 05:53:31,470
At least...

7403
05:53:31,470 --> 05:53:32,710
That's insane.

7404
05:53:38,690 --> 05:53:40,110
I messed him up.

7405
05:53:43,230 --> 05:53:43,870
That's crazy.

7406
05:53:48,650 --> 05:53:49,770
Guys, that's actually crazy.

7407
05:53:50,850 --> 05:53:51,810
Oh, I didn't mess it up.

7408
05:53:52,390 --> 05:53:52,750
Oh, I cooked.

7409
05:53:53,890 --> 05:53:54,850
No, they're out, they're out.

7410
05:53:55,370 --> 05:53:56,890
No, no, only a few of them though.

7411
05:53:57,610 --> 05:53:58,550
Oh, I see, I see.

7412
05:53:58,650 --> 05:53:59,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7413
05:54:02,010 --> 05:54:02,870
I'm emoting.

7414
05:54:03,610 --> 05:54:04,870
Wait, he's out, he's out.

7415
05:54:13,180 --> 05:54:14,820
Who are the E-Daters?

7416
05:54:15,160 --> 05:54:16,420
I greeted, I greeted, I greeted.

7417
05:54:25,310 --> 05:54:27,270
We're the E-Daters on our team.

7418
05:54:27,430 --> 05:54:28,230
Yeah, who are they?

7419
05:54:28,610 --> 05:54:29,610
So we can avoid.

7420
05:54:33,410 --> 05:54:35,110
I mean, I avoided JonCelo.

7421
05:54:36,070 --> 05:54:37,190
Is he that bad?

7422
05:54:37,190 --> 05:54:40,610
No, he just doesn't like me.

7423
05:54:40,730 --> 05:54:41,650
Blames me.

7424
05:54:42,670 --> 05:54:43,330
Yeah,

7425
05:54:47,990 --> 05:54:48,370
bro.

7426
05:54:49,830 --> 05:54:52,190
Team mentality is very important.

7427
05:54:58,850 --> 05:55:02,870
Oh, I played Jeff on Spider Island.

7428
05:55:03,630 --> 05:55:05,870
I didn't do that good, to be fair.

7429
05:55:05,870 --> 05:55:09,610
But like, our team went like, everyone negative.

7430
05:55:10,390 --> 05:55:11,970
And everyone just decided to blame me.

7431
05:55:12,830 --> 05:55:16,150
I mean, you were on Jeff, that's like the number one thing to blame.

7432
05:55:17,550 --> 05:55:18,730
Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.

7433
05:55:19,090 --> 05:55:21,470
Our Infest had 19k healing.

7434
05:55:21,810 --> 05:55:22,890
I had 15k.

7435
05:55:23,090 --> 05:55:26,370
And my entire ults were being countered by freaking Mag.

7436
05:55:26,950 --> 05:55:27,910
And I still had more kills.

7437
05:55:30,710 --> 05:55:32,950
Like, it was insane to blame me.

7438
05:55:32,950 --> 05:55:36,910
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, I might die.

7439
05:55:41,650 --> 05:55:43,810
Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7440
05:55:44,130 --> 05:55:45,050
Let's cook that.

7441
05:55:46,270 --> 05:55:46,950
We'll do it.

7442
05:55:55,570 --> 05:56:00,010
I think he's dead, I think...

7443
05:56:00,010 --> 05:56:00,310
Okay.

7444
05:56:01,390 --> 05:56:02,250
Alright, let's do it.

7445
05:56:02,250 --> 05:56:04,370
Ready, ready, stack.

7446
05:56:04,610 --> 05:56:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait, wait, okay, that's all three, it's all...

7447
05:56:11,090 --> 05:56:12,870
We used three subpoenas.

7448
05:56:19,110 --> 05:56:20,890
That's so funny, that's so funny.

7449
05:56:21,110 --> 05:56:24,390
Okay, guys, I don't think anything can save us now.

7450
05:56:26,130 --> 05:56:27,420
I think we used...

7451
05:56:27,830 --> 05:56:30,470
You know what, do you think we can outrun it with Mantisult?

7452
05:56:31,650 --> 05:56:32,790
No, I don't have Mantisult.

7453
05:56:34,430 --> 05:56:38,150
No, we just use one ult, die, and then save another subpoena.

7454
05:56:40,290 --> 05:56:41,270
Oh, are they Bucky?

7455
05:56:41,670 --> 05:56:42,450
Are they Mantis?

7456
05:56:42,650 --> 05:56:44,010
Wait, not Mantis, they, uh...

7457
05:56:44,010 --> 05:56:45,990
They use all DPS ults, they...

7458
05:56:47,650 --> 05:56:51,190
I don't know, I feel like if I ult, I'm outrunning them.

7459
05:56:51,550 --> 05:56:52,790
Like, I'm losing.

7460
05:56:53,970 --> 05:56:55,750
I don't know, because I know it's sexual.

7461
05:56:56,170 --> 05:56:59,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys may die, you guys may die, but I'm outrunning you.

7462
05:56:59,630 --> 05:57:02,870
Yo, that was a great ult, that was a great ult, we all saw that.

7463
05:57:03,750 --> 05:57:04,390
Thank you, thank you.

7464
05:57:04,650 --> 05:57:05,310
Are you ulted?

7465
05:57:05,590 --> 05:57:07,890
I definitely just didn't hit 5 or anything.

7466
05:57:08,250 --> 05:57:13,730
I think it was a support diff there, we actually helped you out.

7467
05:57:18,230 --> 05:57:19,470
Yeah, you're welcome.

7468
05:57:23,210 --> 05:57:23,630
Oh,

7469
05:57:28,250 --> 05:57:28,550
goodbye.

7470
05:57:30,270 --> 05:57:31,710
Yeah, I'm a DPS.

7471
05:57:33,310 --> 05:57:36,030
There is a Captain America on your supports right now.

7472
05:57:36,650 --> 05:57:37,790
Oh, it's okay, he ran away.

7473
05:57:39,410 --> 05:57:40,990
Alright, we need a cap point.

7474
05:57:41,250 --> 05:57:42,370
How are they all dead again?

7475
05:57:43,190 --> 05:57:44,770
Why are you guys so much better than them?

7476
05:57:45,870 --> 05:57:47,810
Alright, they're gonna, they're gonna rez.

7477
05:57:48,270 --> 05:57:50,490
Alright, they're gonna do the Wombo Combo maybe, alright?

7478
05:57:50,570 --> 05:57:51,490
Let's be ready here.

7479
05:57:51,650 --> 05:57:52,530
Watch out TP, watch out TP!

7480
05:57:55,330 --> 05:57:55,990
Oh shit!

7481
05:57:56,430 --> 05:57:57,530
Oh, we're still playing!

7482
05:57:59,690 --> 05:58:01,050
Okay, they see 9.

7483
05:58:03,710 --> 05:58:05,150
Wait, we did it guys!

7484
05:58:05,310 --> 05:58:06,250
GG's everybody!

7485
05:58:06,550 --> 05:58:07,390
Go to your tournament!

7486
05:58:08,030 --> 05:58:08,970
Gomez, go team!

7487
05:58:17,360 --> 05:58:21,200
That was, that was a good game!

7488
05:58:25,500 --> 05:58:27,100
Okay, not gonna lie.

7489
05:58:28,380 --> 05:58:30,760
Not, not gonna lie.

7490
05:58:31,540 --> 05:58:36,580
If anything, I think that has to be the game that we call it.

7491
05:58:36,680 --> 05:58:41,800
That was, that was a really good game.

7492
05:58:41,940 --> 05:58:46,820
I think that has to be the best game to like, call it in general.

7493
05:58:47,280 --> 05:58:53,020
Because it was, it was a really good final game.

7494
05:58:53,360 --> 05:58:56,660
And, I get to stay on the leaderboard!

7495
05:58:56,880 --> 05:58:57,800
Let's go!

7496
05:59:01,500 --> 05:59:03,800
Yeah, that's crazy!

7497
05:59:04,440 --> 05:59:09,120
We all, we did three support ults and we still died!

7498
05:59:09,420 --> 05:59:11,640
That's actually fucking crazy!

7499
05:59:12,040 --> 05:59:16,980
We all stacked each other and we didn't even survive it!

7500
05:59:17,340 --> 05:59:18,600
Oh my god!

7501
05:59:21,820 --> 05:59:27,960
Yeah, it was a good game with good teammates and like, good bonding time.

7502
05:59:27,960 --> 05:59:37,660
We actually talked, we actually, you know, had a good time with our teammates and actually talked with each other.

7503
05:59:38,040 --> 05:59:38,960
That was crazy.

7504
05:59:39,740 --> 05:59:41,980
That was crazy fun, though.

7505
05:59:49,220 --> 05:59:51,140
Oh my god.

7506
05:59:51,640 --> 05:59:52,760
Oh my god.

7507
05:59:53,080 --> 05:59:53,720
It's alright.

7508
05:59:54,600 --> 05:59:55,820
I had a great time.

7509
05:59:55,820 --> 05:59:59,420
Three support ults versus Unstoppable Journey.

7510
06:00:02,760 --> 06:00:09,240
Okay, anyway guys, I hope you all had a great time watching.

7511
06:00:09,740 --> 06:00:14,060
I'm glad that we ended it on a high note there.

7512
06:00:14,920 --> 06:00:17,440
Okay, so yeah, anyway.

7513
06:00:18,000 --> 06:00:32,420
Speaking of Marble Rivals, starting next week, depending on whenever it's finalized, I'll be back to streaming on Twitch for Marble Rivals Grinds.

7514
06:00:35,240 --> 06:00:39,080
Because we'll be working together with Rivals soon!

7515
06:00:39,300 --> 06:00:39,620
Yay!

7516
06:00:40,440 --> 06:00:42,720
But that also means...

7517
06:00:42,720 --> 06:00:48,220
That also means I have to stream Marble Rivals consistently.

7518
06:00:54,580 --> 06:00:59,400
And I don't want to do most of my Rank Grind on YouTube.

7519
06:01:00,360 --> 06:01:08,380
So we will be back playing Rank on Twitch, maybe starting next week.

7520
06:01:08,560 --> 06:01:12,020
And it'll just be whenever I have the time.

7521
06:01:12,520 --> 06:01:15,740
So yeah, anyway, I'm glad we ended it on a high note.

7522
06:01:16,100 --> 06:01:18,580
It started off very rough.

7523
06:01:18,940 --> 06:01:20,540
And then we started believing.

7524
06:01:20,800 --> 06:01:22,400
And now I know I'm not the problem.

7525
06:01:22,560 --> 06:01:24,040
And that's all that matters to me.

7526
06:01:30,140 --> 06:01:31,000
Anyway, guys.

7527
06:01:33,020 --> 06:01:34,360
We made it to a high note.

7528
06:01:34,460 --> 06:01:37,120
That last game was such a good game.

7529
06:01:37,240 --> 06:01:40,320
That was actually such a good game to end it on.

7530
06:01:42,560 --> 06:01:43,320
Anyway, guys.

7531
06:01:43,600 --> 06:01:44,660
As always, everybody.

7532
06:01:44,860 --> 06:01:45,740
Stay hydrated.

7533
06:01:46,040 --> 06:01:46,680
Posture check.

7534
06:01:47,060 --> 06:01:47,760
Get up and move around.

7535
06:01:47,840 --> 06:01:48,760
Get that blood flowing.

7536
06:01:48,920 --> 06:01:51,120
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

7537
06:01:51,200 --> 06:01:52,500
Because you deserve it.

7538
06:01:52,760 --> 06:01:54,360
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

7539
06:01:54,580 --> 06:01:55,440
Bye, guys.

7540
06:01:55,820 --> 06:01:56,260
Bye!
